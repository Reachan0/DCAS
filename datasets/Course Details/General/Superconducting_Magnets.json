      "content": "1 of 11\n1. Flux Flow and Flux Flow Resistivity\nThe phenomena of flux motion and flux flow resistivity are really the heart of the dissipative\nmechanism in superconductors. In order to understand the phenomena it must be shown that the\nflux vortices do, indeed move and if they move, the action is dissipative. This can be shown by\nconsidering the case of an unpinned ideal type II superconductor carrying a transport current in a\nuniform background field as shown in, Fig. 2.14. The transport current interacts with the flux\nquanta to exert a Lorentz force on each flux vortex of the form\n\no\nt\nL\nJ\nf\nφ\n×\n=\n.\n\nIn the above expression fL is the force per unit length on the flux vortex, Jt is the transport\ncurrent density and φo is the quantum of flux in the vortex. The moving flux vortices will\ninduce an electric field E , given by\n\no\nL\nL\nn\nv\nB\nv\nE\nφ\n×\n=\n×\n=\n\n(1)\n\nwhere vL, is the velocity of flux lines and n is the number of flux lines per unit area such that\nB=~nφo. Since there is no pinning force to balance the Lorentz force, we might assume that the\nflux lines accelerate and thus E would increase with time. However, the observed voltage\nindicates that E is constant in time implying a drag force must exist to balance the Lorentz\nforce. This force balance was proposed by Kim in the form\n\no\nt\nL\nL\nJ\nf\nv\nφ\nη\n×\n=\n=\n\n(2)\n\nwhere η is a viscous damping constant. The damping force is dissipative and thus requires a\npower input P= J-E to maintain the transport current. Equations (1) and (2) can be combined to\ndefine the \"flux flow resistivity\":\n\nη\nφ\nρ\no\nf\nB\nJ\nE =\n=\n\n(3)\n\nExperimental measurement of ρf determines the viscosity coefficient η.\n\nSo far, no mention has .been made of exactly what is the dissipative mechanism due to a moving\nvortex. Experimental measurements of ρf by Kim, Hempstead and Strnad show that it is a\nfunction of temperature, and as T goes to 0, it is well correlated by the expression\n\nc\nn\nf\nH\nH\nρ\nρ\n=\n\n(4)\n\n2 of 11\nwhere ρn is the resistivity of the normal material [-]. The ratio H/Hc2 is just the fraction of the\nnormal core area. This is a very interesting result because it implies that the dissipation is due to\nthe transport current flowing through the normal cores of the moving flux vortices.\n\nActually there have been several theories about the dissipative mechanism but one of the more\nsuccessful and simpler models was derived by Bardeen and Stephen [-]. The model is very\nsimple in that it assumes that all the dissipation takes place by normal resistivity in the central\ncore of the flux vortices where the normal radius is assumed to be equal to ξ - They solve for\nthe electric field distribution due to a flux vortex moving across the specimen and then derive the\ncurrent distribution and energy dissipation due to this induced electric field. The resulting\nexpression for the flux flow resistivity agrees with the empirically determined expression (Eq. 4)\ngiven by Kim.\n\nOther more rigorous analyses of this dissipative mechanism were given by Schmid [-], Carol i\nand Maki [-], and Hu and Thompson [-] by using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. A\ndifferent approach was taken by Clem [-] who derived the dissipation due to the irreversible\nentropy generation at the trailing and leading edges of the moving flux vortex where the normal-\nsuperconducting transitions occur. There is no consensus as to which analysis is correct, if the\ndifferent mechanisms are additive, or if they are all different ways of calculating the same thing.\nNo matter, the important point is that dissipation does indeed occur whenever the flux vortices\nare set in motion and the simple empirical form for the flux flow resistivity is useful to describe\nthis effect.\n\nThe flux flow resistivity is the underlying dissipative mechanism that is responsible for the ac\nloss but it is crucial to note that dissipation only occurs when the vortices are set in motion. In\nthe next section it is shown how this flux motion is caused by a changing external magnetic field\nor transport current. However the flux flow resistivity is not explicitly included in the ac loss\ncalculation.\n\nNow that the dissipative mechanism is quantified a lot of the behavior of type II superconductors\ncan be explained. For instance, an ideal type II superconductor has a very low value of critical\ncurrent, because, in the absence of pinning sites to restrain the flux motion, energy dissipation\nincreases as the square of the current, thereby excessively heating the sample above Tc and\ndestroying the superconductivity.\n\nBy contrast, in a non-ideal type II superconductor, the number and strength of the pinning sites\nprevent the flux motion until very high values of current cause the Lorentz force to exceed the\npinning force. Experimental verification of the flux flow was done by Van Ooijen and Van Gurp\n[-], who showed that the flux is actually pinned in \"bundles\" of many flux quanta. Flux motion\nis also involved in two other interesting phenomena, namely flux creep and flux jumping. These\nwill be discussed in conjunction with the critical state model.\n\n3 of 11\n2 The Critical State\nThe concepts of flux pinning, flux motion and viscous damping have been used to develop the\ncritical state model. Again 1et us consider a non-ideal type II superconductor with pinning. In\nreality, not every vortex is pinned, just some of them. However, due to the repulsion between\nfluxons, the vortex lattice is fairly rigid, thereby effectively pinning all the vortices. Thus one\ncan use an average pinning force per unit length of core, fp . As long as the Lorentz force due\nto the transport current is less than the pinning force, i.e. Jtφo < fp , the system is stable.\n\nThe critical state then is just the state where the Lorentz force is exactly equal to the pinning\nforce and is governed by the equation:\n\np\no\nc\nf\nJ\n=\nφ\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Jc is called the critical current density. If the current exceeds the critical current, flux\nflow and dissipation occur.\n\nC.P. Bean [-] suggested that Jc = constant, whereas Kim [-] suggested that Jc vary as 1/B ,\nthese two being the most widely used forms of the critical state model. Each form gives accurate\nresults for different conditions of magnetic field.\n\nWhen J is raised above Jc the Lorentz force exceeds the pinning force and the flux vortices are\nset in motion.

Figure 2.15a shows a typical plot of voltage\nalong a specimen versus current. The different curves show the effect of increasing the\nimpurities for pinning sites and thus increasing Jc . In Fig. 2.15b the effect of H in Eq. (7) is\nshown. The flux flow resistivity is plotted versus applied magnetic field at different\ntemperatures in Fig. 2.15c.\n\nThe curves are asymptotic to the line for T=0 at low fields. Extrapolation of the measured\nresistivity data along this line is often done to predict the value of Hc2 at T = 0.\n\nTwo other interesting features of the critical state model are phenomena called flux creep and\nflux jumping. Flux creep is caused by random jumping of flux vortices from one pinning site to\nanother due to thermally induced vibrations. It manifests itself by slow decay of a trapped\nmagnetic field and/or by a measurable resistive voltage. This phenomena has been described by\nthe Anderson-Kim flux creep theory which assumes the vortices move in bundles [-,-]. This\ncreep phenomenon is exceedingly slow resulting in decay times for persistent currents in\nsuperconducting loops of many millions of years. However this effect can lead to a potentially\nmore dramatic effect called a flux jump.\n\nThe flux jump occurs due to a thermal instability. It is best explained by a series of steps. First\nassume some flux vortices are set in motion from the pinning site either by flux creep\nphenomena or due to some other disturbance, such as a change in the external field or transport\ncurrent or by an increase in temperature. The motion of the vortices dissipates energy which\nlocally increases the temperature. Since the pinning strength is inversely proportional to\ntemperature more vortices can be released from their pinning sites due to the lowered pinning\nforce. This flux motion again leads to more dissipation, higher temperatures, and thus more flux\nmotion in a cascading effect. The total effect is called a flux jump. If the effect is not damped\nout the result could be a catastrophic flux jump in which the temperature of the sample is rapidly\nincreased above the critical temperature thus creating a normal region which could rapidly\npropagate and quench the entire winding. Flux creep does not necessarily always lead to flux\njumps and flux jumps are not always catastrophic.\n\nOnce the underlying physical basis of the phenomena was understood methods of damping this\ninstability were soon devised. These methods are described in the following section on technical\nsuperconductors.\n\n3. The Critical State Model Applied to AC Losses\nThe previous discussion of superconducting phenomena proposed that experimental evidence\nexists in support of the critical state model for type II superconductors. Acceptance of this\nmodel is crucial for it provides a convenient method of computing the loss in a superconductor\nsubjected to a time varying field or transport current. That is, the hysteresis loss in a\nsuperconductor can be computed from a succession of quasistatic time steps between equilibrium\ndistributions of magnetic field and current within the specimen. At each equilibrium step the\nsuperconductor is in the critical state. The mechanism which allows the field and current\ndistribution to change from one state to the next is the flux flow resistivity.\n\n5 of 11\nHowever, there is no need to determine the flux flow resistivity, ρf ,.explicitly in order to\ncalculate the loss. It is sufficient to compute the electric field, E and the current distribution, J\nfrom the quasistatic Maxwell equations\n\nt\nB\nE\nJ\nH\n∂\n∂\n-\n=\n×\n∇\n=\n×\n∇\n\nand\n\n(8)\n\nThis condition will hold as long as\n\nm\np\nB\nt\nB\nτ\n<<\n∂\n∂\n\nwhere Bp is the magnetic field required to fully penetrate the filament and τm is the time\nconstant for magnetic flux to diffuse through the filament. The diffusive time constant can be\ncomputed from the magnetic diffusivity which is given by\n\no\nf\nm\nD\nμ\nρ\n=\n\n(9)\n\nwhere ρf is the flux flow resistivity. The time constant then is\n\nf\no\nm\nm\nL\nD\nL\nρ\nμ\nτ\n=\n=\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the characteristic length, L is equal to the filament radius, d/2. An order-of-magnitude\nestimate gives values of τm of order 10-8 sec for a typical NbTi filament diameter of 50μm. As\nlong as the frequency of the external field change does not approach the gigahertz range the\nquasistatic model should hold. For most practical engineering applications the perturbation field\nfrequency would realistically never exceed ~103 hertz, i.e., the kilohertz range.\n\n4. One-Dimensional Flux Penetration\nA one-dimensional slab of non-ideal Type II superconductor is often used as a simple example to\nillustrate the fundamentals of the critical state model. Consider the slab of thickness d in Fig.\n3.1a to be of infinite extent in the y and z directions. If a uniform external field, He ,oriented\nparallel to the sides of the slab in the y direction, is increased above Hc , flux vortices will begin\nto penetrate the specimen. The material will be said to be in the mixed state. The flux will\npenetrate to the point where the pinning force will just balance the Lorentz force on the flux\nbundles. This condition is the critical state and the induced current density is called the critical\ncurrent density, Jc . The field and current distribution will be given by solution of the Maxwell\nequation\nJ\nH =\n×\n∇\nwith the boundary condition that H = He at the surface.\n\n6 of 11\nThe exact form of the solution depends on whether Jc is considered to be independent of H\n(Bean model [-]) or Jc is considered to be inversely proportional to H (Kim model [-]). If we\nchoose the former condition the solution is of the form\n\n(\n)\nd\nx\nJ\nH\nH\nc\ne\n-\n+\n=\n\n(11)\n\nThe field penetrates to the point xp given by\n\nc\ne\np\nJ\nH\nd\nx\n-\n= 2\n\n(12)\n\nThe slab is fully penetrated when He = Hp where\n\nd\nJ\nH\nc\np =\n\n(13)\n\nThe field and current distributions that correspond to the Bean model are shown in Figs. 3.1a\nthough 3.1c for an increasing external field, and in Figs. 3.1d through 3.1g for a decreasing\nexternal field. The hysteresis inherent in the superconductor is shown by the trapped flux\nremaining in the slab when the external field is reduced to zero (Fig. 3.1e).\n\nThe magnetization of the slab is given by\n\n∫-\n-\n=\nd\nd\ne\nH\nHdx\nd\nM\n\n(14)\n\nand the magnetization curve for a complete cycle to the upper critical field limit of Hc2 is shown\nin Fig. 3.2.

These simple slab models serve as a\ngood basis for estimating the hysteresis loss calculations. Solution for a two dimensional\ngeometry is possible but the solutions are not analytic except for the most limiting cases. A 2D\nsolution requires significant non-linear numerical analysis, but the simpler results for 1D models\nare usually accurate within about a factor of 2 or better.\n\n5. One-Dimensional Effect of Transport Current\nThe effect of a transport current in the slab specimen can developed by arguments consistent\nwith the critical state model. Consider the one-dimensional slab to be in a uniform external field\nand carrying a transport current It, in the z-direction, that is a fraction of the critical current Ic\nsuch that 0<It/Ic <1 . The current and field distribution for the slab is shown in Fig, 3.4. Note\nthat the current flows everywhere in the cross-section at the critical current density Jc which has\nbeen assumed a constant as per the Bean model. If the external field is cycled by an amount +Hm\nabout the value He the current and field distributions will be as shown in Fig. 3.4(a-h).\n\nSince one can picture the central region of the slab as being occupied by the transport current, the\nfield required to fully penetrate to this region will now be less than the field required to penetrate\nto the center of the slab, that is the full penetration field at zero transport current, Hp(0) = Jcd/2.\nThe full penetration field now depends upon the fraction of transport current and is given by\n\n( )\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛-\n=\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛\nc\nt\np\nc\nt\np\nI\nI\nH\nI\nI\nH\n\n(22)\n\nThe magnetization and the hysteresis loss can be computed as before from Eqs.

      "content": "1 of 18\n1.0 Review of Electromagnetic Field Theory\n\nSelected aspects of electromagnetic theory are reviewed in this section, with emphasis on\nconcepts which are useful in understanding magnet design. Detailed, rigorous treatments\nare presented in standard texts on the subject. [1,2,3]\n\n1.1 General Form of the Equations\nThe concepts of electric and magnetic fields are related to the observation of forces\nexperienced by an electric charge. A charge of q coulombs moving with velocity v can\nexperience a force independent of its velocity and perpendicular to it. The total is the\nLorentz force F\nG\nwhich can be expressed as\n\n(\n)\nB\nv\nE\nq\nF\nG\nG\nG\nG\n×\n+\n=\n\n(1.1)\nThis serves to define the electric field intensity E\nG\nand the magnetic flux density B\nG\nin\nterms of the charge q, the velocity of the charge relative to the observer vG , and the total\nforce experienced by the charge F\nG\n. Consider a volume element\nV\n∆\nwhich contains\ncharges. If a charge density ρ, is defined as the limit of the ratio of the charge contained\nin\nV\n∆\nto\nV\n∆\nas\nV\n∆\n→ 0, and if a force density f\nG\nis defined as the limit of\nV\nF ∆\nG\nas\nV\n∆\n→ 0, then (1.1) becomes\n\nB\nv\nE\nf\ne\ne\nK\nG\nG\nG\n×\n+\n=\nρ\nρ\n\n(1.2)\nThe quantity\nv\ne\nG\nρ\nrepresents a charge density in motion which is a current density J\nG\n.\nThroughout these notes it is implicitly assumed that there is no relative motion of\ncomponents: therefore, convection currents which result from the motion of conductors\nare neglected. Equation (1.2) can therefore be written as\n\nB\nJ\nE\nf\ne\nK\nK\nG\nG\n×\n+\n= ρ\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe first term of this equation represents a force on static charges whereas the second is a\nforce on moving charges or currents. In problems associated with magnet design, the\n\n2 of 18\ninteractions between currents and magnetic fields are of primary interest. Forces due to\nthe presence of free charge densities are usually negligible by comparison and (1.3)\nreduces to\nB\nJ\nf\nG\nG\nG\n×\n=\n\n(1.4)\nFor any particular case, the validity of this approximation can be checked by evaluating\nE\ne\nG\nρ\nand comparing it with the result of (1.4).\n\nIf it is postulated that charge must be conserved, the concepts of charge density and\ncurrent density can be combined mathematically to represent a \"law of conservation of\ncharge\" as follows\n\n∫∫∫\n∫∫\n-\n=\n⋅\ndV\ndt\nd\nda\nn\nJ\neρ\nG\nG\n\n(1.5)\n\nIn (1.5)\nda\nnG\nis an incremental area element of a closed surface and nG is a normal,\noutwardly directed unit vector at the element. The incremental volume element within\nthe closed surface is dV. Equation (1.5) therefore states that the net flow of charge out of\nthe closed surface is equal to the rate of decrease of total charge within the enclosed\nvolume. In the structural and electrical problems associated with magnet design, free\nspace charge densities can usually be neglected and thus (1.5) reduces to\n\n=\n⋅\n∫∫\nda\nn\nJ G\nG\n\n(1.6)\nThe equivalent differential form of (1.6) is\n\n=\n⋅\n∇J\nG\n\n(1.7)\nEquations (1.6) and (1.7) normally enter magnet design problems implicitly rather than\nexplicitly. Simply interpreted, both equations require that lines of current must form\nclosed loops to be physically realizable.\n\n3 of 18\nThe other conditions for physical realizability of the electric and magnetic fields were\nformulated by Maxwell as follows\nda\nn\nB\ndt\nd\nld\nE\n∫∫\n∫\n⋅\n-\n=\n⋅\nG\nG\nG\nG\n\n(1.8)\nda\nn\nJ\nda\nn\nE\ndt\nd\nld\nH\no\n∫∫\n∫\n∫∫\n⋅\n=\n⋅\n-\n⋅\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nG\nε\n\n(1.9)\nThe first integral in each equation is taken around a closed contour having an incremental\nlength ld\nG\n. The area integrals are taken over a simply connected surface bounded by a\ncontour. The quantity H\nG\nis the magnetic field intensity which in free space (that is,\nwhen magnetizable material is not present) is related to the magnetic flux density through\nH\nB\no\nG\nG\nμ\n=\n.\n\nThe magnitude of the constant\no\nμ is dependent on the system of units employed. This\nquantity is the permeability of free space or vacuum, and has the value of 4π×10-7 H/m in\nthe SI system. The constant\no\nε is permittivity of free space which is a derived quantity.\nIn SI units\no\nε has a value of 8.854×10-12 F/m.

Experimental evidence\nshows that this constant is zero. The last of the equations for physical realizability is\ntherefore\n\n=\n⋅\n∇B\nG\n\n(1.17)\nNote that this is a direct consequence of (1.10). In integral from, (1.17) can be expressed\nas\n∫∫\n=\n⋅\nda\nn\nB G\nG\n\n(1.18)\nA simple interpretation of (1.17) and (1.18) is that magnetic flux lines must form closed\nloops to be physically realizable (no magnetic monopoles!).\n\nEither the integral equations 91.6), (1.8), (1.12), and (1.18), or the differential equations\n(1.7), (1.10), (1.13), and (1.17) form the set of governing equations of interest in magnet\ndesign. The reduction of these equations or of the more general equations with\ndisplacement current terms to magnetostatics can be done directly by setting all terms\ninvolving a time derivative to zero. The conditions under which the displacement current\nterms can be neglected even though the situation involves variations in time is discussed\nin the following section.\n\n5 of 18\n1.2 Reduction to Magnet Systems and Magnetostatics\nIn order to illustrate conditions under which the displacement current term can be\nneglected, consider a region of space where\n\nH\nB\no\nG\nG\nμ\n=\n\n(1.19)\nE\nJ\nK\nG\nσ\n=\n\n(1.20)\nThat is, the magnetic flux density is related to H\nG\nthrough the constant\no\nμ and the current\ndensity J\nG\nis related to the electric field intensity E\nG\nthrough the constant σ , which is the\nelectrical conductivity.\n\nIf the curl of (1.11) is taken and (1.19) and (1.20) are used, then\n\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nE\nt\nJ\nB\no\no\no\nG\nG\nG\n×\n∇\n∂\n∂\n+\n×\n∇\n=\n×\n∇\n×\n∇\nε\nμ\nμ\n\n(1.21)\nThis can be rewritten using (1.10) and (1.20) as follows\n\n(\n)\nt\nB\nt\nB\nB\no\no\no\n∂\n∂\n-\n∂\n∂\n-\n=\n×\n∇\n×\n∇\nG\nG\nG\nε\nμ\nσ\nμ\n\n(1.22)\nThis can be reduced using a vector identity+ and (1.17), as follows\n\n=\n∂\n∂\n-\n∂\n∂\n-\n-\n∇\nt\nB\nt\nB\nB\no\no\no\nG\nG\nG\nε\nμ\nσ\nμ\n\n(1.23)\n\nThis is a wave equation which governs the behavior of the magnetic flux density B\nG\nin\nmaterials with homogeneous isotropic conductivity and the permeability and permittivity\nof free space. Similar equations govern E\nG\nand J\nG\n. Equation (1.23) forms the basis for\\\nstudy in areas such as waveguides and transmission lines. For the structural and electrical\nproblems encountered in magnet design, the last term in (1.23) can be neglected which\n\n+\n(\n)\nB\nB\nB\nG\nG\nG\n∇\n-\n⋅\n∇\n∇\n=\n×\n∇\n×\n∇\n\n6 of 18\nreduces (1.23) to a diffusion equation. If the configuration being analyzed is also time\ninvariant or varying slowly with time, then the second term can also be dropped which\nreduces the equation to the vector form of Laplace's equation. It is important to retain\nthe distinction that it is the vector form.\n\nThe physical conditions under which some of the terms of (1.23) be neglected can be\nilluminated by casting the equation in dimensionless form. This can be accomplished by\ndefining the following dimensionless variables.\no\nB\nB\nB\nG\n=\nˆ\n\nl\nz\nl\ny\nl\nx\nz\ny\nx\n,\n,\nˆ\n,ˆ\n,ˆ\n=\n\n∇\n=\n∇\nl\nˆ\n\nt\nt\nω\n=\nˆ\n\n=\no\nB\ncharacteristic magnetic flux density\n=\nl\ncharacteristic length\n=\nω\ncharacteristic frequency\nIf the above are substituted in 91.23) and terms rearranged, the result is that\n\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n=\n∂\n∂\n-\n∂\n∂\n-\n∇\nt\nB\nl\nt\nB\nl\nB\no\no\no\nω\nε\nμ\nσω\nμ\n\n(1.24)\nThe functional form for the solution of the dimensionless magnetic flux density is\ntherefore\n\n,ˆ,ˆ\n,ˆ\n,ˆ\n(ˆ\nˆ\nl\nt\nz\ny\nx\nB\nB\no\no\nω\nε\nμ\n=\n\n(1.25)\nThe solution is thus dependent on the dimensionless space and time variables as well as\ntwo additional dimensionless parameters. These two parameters describe the relative\nstrength or importance of the second and third terms in comparison with the first term in\nthe governing equation.\n\nFor example, consider the parameter associated with the third term of (1.24). This\nparameter can be rewritten using the fact that\n1 c\no\no\n=\nε\nμ\nwhere c is the velocity of light\nwhich is equal to the speed of an electromagnetic wave in free space.[4]\n\n7 of 18\n\nc\nl\nl\no\no\nω\nω\nε\nμ\n=\n\n(1.26)\nlf l is a characteristic length of the component or material under consideration then\nc\nl\n\nis the time required for the propagation of an electromagnetic disturbance or wave across\nthis length. If the characteristic frequency ω with which the field is changing at a point\nis low, then the time\nω\nπ\n=\nt\nassociated with this change is long compared with the\ntime required for propagation of the disturbance across the device to another point. If the\nfrequency is low enough then the disturbance is, in effect, felt everywhere in the device at\nthe same time, and the wave character of the problem can be neglected. That is, the third\nterm in (1.23) can be ignored if\n\n<<\nc\nl\nω\n\n(1.27)\nThis is usually the case in magnet design. The third term in (1-24) is therefore neglected\nin the remainder of this section. In addition, the neglect of this term is an implicit\nassumption which is made for the analyses throughout these notes. The second terms of\n(1.9) and (1.11) are also neglected since they are the source of the wave character of the\nequation under discussion. Equation (1.24) therefore becomes\n\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n=\n∂\n∂\n-\n∇\nt\nB\nl\nB\noσω\nμ\n\n(1.28)\nThis is a diffusion equation in which the strength of the diffusion term is determined by\nthe magnitude of the dimensionless parameter\n2l\noσω\nμ\n. This parameter is frequently\ncalled the magnetic Reynolds number. If the conditions of a particular problem are such\nthat\n\n2 <<\nl\noσω\nμ\n\n(1.29)\nthen the fields are essentially static or steady state in nature and (1.28) reduces to\n\nˆ\nˆ 2\n=\n∇B\n\n(1.30)\nThis is the form of the governing equation for magnetostatics. The concept of the\nmagnetic Reynolds number is a useful tool which is considered in depth in a later section.\n\n8 of 18\n\n1.3 Boundary Conditions\nThe differential equations given in Sections 1.1 and 1.2 together with the constituent\nrelations presented in Section 1.4 govern the relationship between the field variables in\nany region of space. If several regions having different properties are involved, boundary\nconditions are required to determine how the fields cross the surface which separates one\nregion from another. These boundary conditions can be derived using the integral form\nof the equations given earlier. Since the primary interest is in magnet design, only those\nconstituent relations and boundary conditions which are necessary for use with (1.7),\n(1.10), (1.13), and (1.17) are considered.\n\nTwo boundary conditions on the magnetic field must be considered, one to specify the\nrelationship between the components of field normal to a boundary, and the other to\nspecify the relationship between components tangent to a boundary. These can be found\nfrom (1.18) and (1.12) respectively.\n\nFirst, (1.18) is applied to a small, closed cylindrical surface placed such that its faces are\nin two regions parallel to the boundary between regions, as shown in Figure 1.3-1. The\ndimensions of the cylinder are reduced about a point P located on the boundary which is\nwithin the cylindrical surface. The result is a condition which requires that the\ncomponent of B\nG\nnormal to the boundary be continuous. This can be expressed\nmathematically as\n\n(\n)\n=\n-\n⋅\nB\nB\nn\nG\nG\nG\n\n(1.31)\nwhere\nB\nG\nand\nB\nG\nare the magnetic flux densities at P in Regions 1 and 2. respectively,\nand nG is a unit vector at P normal to the boundary and directed from Region 1 to Region\n2.\nThe second boundary condition can be found by applying (1.12) to a contour which\nsurrounds a small plane perpendicular to the boundary between Regions 1 and 2. as\nshown in Figure 1.3-2. If nG is again a unit vector at P which is normal to the boundary\nand directed from Region 1 to Region 2, then shrinking the dimensions about P results in\n\n9 of 18\n\n(\n)\nK\nH\nH\nn\nG\nG\nG\nG\n=\n-\n×\n\n(1.32)\n\nwhere K\nG\nis a surface current density or current sheet which flows in the boundary. This\nis often absent in practical problems but is useful in certain idealized models. The\nboundary condition of (1.32) requires that the component of H\nG\ntangential to the surface\nbe discontinuous at the boundary if a current sheet exists, and that the discontinuity in H\nG\n\nbe equal in magnitude to the surface current density and at right angles to it.\n\n1.4 Constituent Relations\nIn a typical magnetic field system, the conduction process accounts for the free current\ndensity in materials. The most common constituent relationship is Ohm's law,\n\nE\nJ\nG\nG\nσ\n=\n\n(1.33)\n\nwhere σ is the electrical conductivity. The conductivity is typically assumed to be\nconstant within a region, which requires that the conductivity in that region be\nhomogeneous and isotropic. Throughout these notes it is implicitly assumed that there is\nno relative motion of the magnet components being analyzed.\n\nEquation (1.33) is used in Section 1.2 together with the following constituent relationship\nwhich relates the magnetic flux density tot the magnetic field intensity in free space or in\nmaterials having the permeability of free space.\n\nH\nB\no\nG\nG\nμ\n=\n\n(1.34)\nThe simplest form of constituent relation for a magnetic material is to assume that the\nmaterial is homogeneous and isotropic and that the field vectors are related by the\npermeability μ . which is constant, as follows\n\nH\nB\nG\nG\nμ\n=\n\n(1.35)\n\n10 of 18\nOften magnetic materials are used in which B\nG\nis not directly proportional H\nG\n. For\nthese the constitutive relationship takes the form\n\n( )H\nH\nB\nG\nG\nμ\n=\n\n(1.36)\n\nwhere\nH\nH\nG\n=\n. Some materials exhibit hysteresis which means that (1.36) is not single\nvalued. In some applications this effect can be important; however, for many magnet\ndesigns a single-valued functional dependence is usually adequate. Data from which\n(1.36) can be derived is given in one of several forms. For example, the permeability\nmay be plotted as a function of H\nG\n, that is, μ versus H\nG\n. Frequently, either B\nG\nor the\nquantity (\n)\nH\nB\no\nG\nG\nμ\n-\nwill be plotted versus H\nG\n.\n\nThe concept of magnetization arises in electromagnetic theory when the magnetic field is\nconsidered as being generated by two sources, one associated with an applied current\ndensity J\nG\nwhich can be controlled directly, and the other associated with magnetizable\nmaterial. The magnetizable material can be considered to consist of a source of current\ndensity\nm\nJ\nG\nwhich is not controllable in that these magnetic currents cannot be circulated\nthrough an external circuit. With these two sources, (1.13) becomes\n\nm\no\nJ\nJ\nB\nG\nG\nG\n+\n=\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n×\n∇\nμ\n\n(1.37)\nIf a magnetization density M\nG\nis defined such that\n\nm\nJ\nM\nG\nG\n=\n×\n∇\n\n(1.38)\n\nthen (1.37) can be rewritten as\n\nJ\nM\nB\no\nG\nG\nG\n=\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n-\n×\n∇\nμ\n\n(1.39)\n\n11 of 18\nComparison of this equation with (1.13) indicates that the magnetic field intensity H\nG\ncan\nbe written in terms of the magnetization density as\n\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n-\n=\nM\nB\nH\no\nG\nG\nG\nμ\n\n(1.40)\n\nThus a plot of the quantity (\n)\nH\nB\no\nG\nG\nμ\n-\nversus H\nG\nis the same as a plot of\nM\no\nG\nμ\nversus H\nG\n.\nThis is a convenient formulation because M\nG\nis frequently saturated when magnetic\nmaterials are used in large, high field magnets.\n\nA magnetic susceptibility χ can also be defined such that\n\nH\nM\nG\nG\nχ\n=\n\n(1.41)\nThe magnetic susceptibility is related to the permeability through\n\n(\n)\nχ\nμ\nμ\n+\n=\no\n\n(1.42)\n\n1.5 Potential Functions\nPotential functions can be used to reduce the number of variables or otherwise simplify\nthe process of finding a solution to the governing equations. The requirement of (1.17)\nthat the divergence of B\nG\nbe zero naturally leads to the definition of a vector potential A\nG\n\nof the form\n\nB\nA\nG\nG\n=\n×\n∇\n\n(1.43)\nThis formulation automatically satisfies (1.17) since the divergence of the curl of any\nvector field is zero. For this analysis it is assumed that the constituent relations are given\nby (1.33) and (1.36). These require that (1) any electrically conducting material be\nhomogeneous and isotropic with a constant electrical conductivity and (2) any\nmagnetically permeable material be homogeneous and isotropic but not necessarily\nlinear, since the permeability can be a function of H\nG\n. It is assumed that this function is\n\n12 of 18\nsingle valued, which requires that hysteresis effects be negligible. Equation (1.43) alone\nis not sufficient to define A\nG\n: however, if\n\n=\n⋅\n∇A\nG\n\n(1.44)\nis imposed a constraint, A\nG\nis fully defined.\n\nSubstitution of (1.43) into (1.10) leads to\n\n=\n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n∂\n∂\n+\n×\n∇\nt\nA\nE\nG\nG\n\n(1.45)\nand to the definition of a scalar potential function φ .

If, as is often the\ncase, the current density distribution is known in a region and is the driver in the\nparticular configuration then the governing equation for that region becomes\n\nc\nJ\nA\nG\nG\n=\n×\n∇\n×\n∇\nμ\n\n(1.49)\n\n13 of 18\nsubject to (1.44).

If the two-dimensional problem is further\nsimplified to consist of a steady-state situation, (1.50) remains unchanged but the right\nside of (1.51) becomes zero.\n\nIn a region of constant permeability μ , (1.13) and (1.43) require that\n\nJ\nA\nK\nK\nμ\n-\n=\n∇2\n\nIn rectangular coordinates the components of this vector equation reduce to a scalar\nLaplacian, as follows:\n\nx\nx\nJ\nA\nG\nG\nμ\n-\n=\n∇2\n\ny\ny\nJ\nA\nG\nG\nμ\n-\n=\n∇2\n\nz\nz\nJ\nA\nG\nG\nμ\n-\n=\n∇2\n\n(1.53)\nNote that each of these represents components of the vector equation (1.52) and that the\nvector form is equivalent to the scalar form of the differential equation only in\n\n14 of 18\nrectangular coordinates. In other coordinate systems, (1.52) does not reduce to the simple\nform of (1.53).\n\nEach of the vector components must satisfy Poisson's equation which has a solution of\nthe form[3]\n\n∫∫∫\n=\nqp\ni\ni\nr\ndV\nJ\nA\nG\nπ\nμ\n\n(1.54)\nwhere\nz\ny\nx\ni\nor\n,\n,\n=\nand\n=\nqp\nr\ndistance from point p where\niA is measured, to point\nq where J\nG\nis measured.\n\nThis can then be written in vector form as\n\n∫∫∫\n=\nqp\nr\ndV\nJ\nA\nG\nK\nπ\nμ\n\n(1.55)\nwhere the integral is taken over the volume of the entire region. Equation (1.55) leads to\na physical interpretation of A\nG\n. Consider a closed circuit of small-cross-section wire\nwhich carries a current density J\nG\n. Outside the wire there is no contribution to the\nvolume integral of (1.55) because\n=\nJ\nG\n. Inside the wire,\ns\nId\ndV\nJ\nG\nG\n=\nwhere I is the\ncurrent and s\ndG is the length of the volume element in the direction of J\nG\n.\nEquation (1.55) then becomes\n\n∫\n=\nqp\nr\ns\nId\nA\nG\nK\nπ\nμ\n\n(1.56)\nTherefore, the vector contribution to A\nG\nat a point by a current-carrying element in a\nclosed circuit is parallel to that element.\n\nEquations (1.43) and (1.55) can be manipulated to show that[4]\n\n15 of 18\n\n(\n)\n∫∫∫\n×\n=\nqp\nqp\nr\ndV\ni\nJ\nπ\nμ\nB\nG\nG\nG\n\n(1.57)\nwhere\nqp\ni\nG\nis a unit vector directed from q to p . This equation is commonly called the\nBiot-Savart law.\n\nIn magnetostatic problems, conditions are steady in time. In current-free regions (1.13)\nbecomes\n\n=\n×\n∇\nH\nG\n\n(1.58)\nwhich is automatically satisfied by a scalar potential function defined by\n\nφ\n-∇\n=\nH\nG\n\n(1.59)\n\nEquations (1.59) and (1.17) together with (1.35) imply that the field can be found by\nsolving\n\n=\n∇ψ\n\n(1.60)\nwhere ψ is the magnetostatic potential.\n\n1.6 Inductance and the Vector Potential\nThe mutual inductance between two circuits b and c can be thought of as the flux linked\nby c per unit current in b with zero current in c. Equation (1.43) defines the vector\npotential as\n\nB\nA\nG\nG\n=\n×\n∇\n\n(1.61)\nthe integral form of this equation is\n\n∫∫\n∫\n⋅\n=\n⋅\nda\nn\nB\nld\nA\nl\nG\nG\nG\nG\n\n(1.62)\n\n16 of 18\nwhere l is a closed contour and the right-hand side is the flux through a simply-\nconnected area bounded by l . If the contour coincides with circuit c which has zero\ncurrent and if the field B\nG\nand thus A\nG\nare generated by a current\nbI in circuit b, then the\nright side of (1.62) is the total flux generated by b and linked by c, as follows\n\n∫∫\nΦ\n=\n⋅\nbc\nda\nn\nB H\nG\n\n(1.63)\nHowever, in linear systems\n\nb\nbc\nbc\nI\nM\n=\nΦ\n\n(1.64)\nwhere\nbc\nM\nis the mutual inductance between circuits b and c. Therefore\n\nc\nd\nA\nI\nM\nc\nb\nb\nbc\nG\nG\n⋅\n=\n∫\n\n(1.65)\nThe subscript is added to A\nG\nin (1.65) to indicate that the vector potential is generated by\nthe current\nbI in circuit b although it is measured and integrated around circuit c which\nhas zero current. This relationship can be used to obtain accurate inductance calculations\nthrough numerical integration.\n\n1.7 Electromagnetic Forces\nThe force of electromagnetic origin is mentioned in Section 1.1 in connection with the\ndefinitions of E\nG\nand of B\nG\n. In a magnet system, the electromagnetic loads are calculated\nby starting with (1.4) which gives the local force density f\nG\non an element which carries\na current density J\nG\nwhile immersed in a magnetic field B\nG\n. If the element and fields are\nsuch that J\nG\nand B\nG\nare uniform over the volume of the element as sketched in Figure\n1.7.1, then the net force on the element is\n\n(\n)\ndl\n\ndw\ndh\n\nB\nJ\nF\nG\nG\nG\n×\n=\n\n(1.66)\nIf this incremental element is part of a larger volume of material carrying current in the\nmagnetic field then the net force on any current-carrying volume or section can be found\nby integration as follows\n\n17 of 18\n\ndl\n\ndw\ndh\n\n∫∫∫\n×\n=\nB\nJ\nF\nG\nG\nG\n\n(1.67)\n\nThis equation can be used to find the net force on a current-carrying body by performing\na volume integration. It can be useful to find the net force by performing an integral over\na closed surface which surrounds the body. This involves the use of the Maxwell Stress\nTensor, which is given by[4]\n\nk\nk\nmn\nm\nn\nmn\nH\nH\nH\nH\nT\nδ\nμ\nμ\n-\n=\n\n(1.68)\nWhere\n\nn\nm\nmn\n=\n= when\nδ\n\nn\nm\nmn\n=\n= when\nδ\n\nand subscripts denote coordinate directions. Repeated subscripts such as k imply a\nsummation. The mth component of the local force density is given by\n\nn\nmn\nm\nx\nT\nf\n∂\n∂\n=\n\n(1.69)\n\nand the net force on a body can be found from\n\nda\nn\nT\nF\nn\nmn\nm\n∫∫\n=\n\n(1.70)\n\nwhere\nn\nn , is the nth component of the outward-directed unit vector n normal to the closed\nsurface surrounding the body.\nThe use of (1.67) requires that the fields be known throughout the volume of integration\nwhereas (1.70) requires that they be known only on the closed surface. Furthermore, the\nclosed surface can be considerably larger than the body on which the net force is desired.\n\n18 of 18\nThis concept is particularly useful when the geometry of the problem is such that some of\nthe components of the tensor or of the integrand in (1.70) are zero.\n\nIt can be shown that the form of (1.68) through (1.70) are the same whether the fields are\ngenerated by free current densities J\nG\n, by magnetized materials, or by a combination of\nthese sources provided that the total field is used. The permeability μ must be isotropic,\nbut can be a function of position. Furthermore, the permeability cannot be a function of\nthe material density although this magnetostriction effect can be included in (1.68)\nthrough an additional term. These constraints are usually unimportant in fusion magnet\nsystems.\n\nREFERENCES - Section I\n1. R.M. Fano, L.J. Chu, R.B. Adler, Electromagnetic Fields, Energy, and Forces, Wiley,\nN.

Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nBronze\nDiffusion: Sn into Nb\nParameters: 700 C, 1-10 days (max. diff. 5-10 μm).\nCu: prevents Nb6Sn5 from forming; a catalyst\nTemperature: good stoichiometry vs. small grains\nBronze: 16wt.%Sn max. >13% makes drawing difficult\nMaximum Nb3Sn:~25wt.%\nAddition of Cu: ~103 better electrically/thermally than bronze\nCon: Sn diffuses more easily into Cu than Nb\nDiffusion barrier, e.g., Ta, to maintain Cu purity\nCu-Sn\nNb\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nExternal Diffusion\nPros: 1) Draw first, then plate with Sn (bronze is hard to draw);\nNo intermediate annealing necessary\n2) >13 wt.%Sn possible, yielding higher Jc\nCons: 1) Thick layer of (>~5 μm) of Sn tend to delaminate;\n2) Sn melts at 230 C, while reaction temp ~700 C\n3) Hard to use with Ta and pure Cu\nNb\nCu\nSn\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nInternal Sn\nPros: 1) Nb intermediate anneal for bronze\n2) Cu and Ta can easily be added\n3) As with external diffusion, higher Jc\nCons: 1) Sn concentration limited\n2) Extrusion of billet problems\nCu\nNb\nSn\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nNb Tube\nPros: 1) Nb3Sn close to Cu stabilizer\n2) Nb acts as a diffusion barrier for Sn (Ta unnecessary)\nCons: 1) Limit to minimum filament size (AC losses)\n2) Because of Nb tubes, process costly\nNb\nCu-Sn\nCu\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nJelly Roll and MJR\nPros: 1) No intermediate anneal\n2) Cu and Ta easily wrapped in roll\n3) Other trace materials can easily be added to core to\nimprove properties\nCu-Sn Sheet\nNb Sheet\nCu\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nOther A15 Materials\nV3Ga\nInferior to Nb3Sn in Tc and Hc2, but better Jc\nCan be processed similar to bronze process\nCons: 1) Reaction at 500 C for 500 h\n2) More brittle than Nb3Sn\nNb3Al\nFabrication difficulties; no bronze process equivalent exists\nBulk Nb3Al requires HT at >1500 C, leading to large grain\nboundaries and other unwanted Al-rich compounds\nMJR proven quite successful in making multifilamentary\ncomposite\nY.

Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nMagnet Winding Constituents\nMagnet winding generally comprises of:\nSuperconductor--Nb-Ti, Nb3Sn, or BSCCO2223\nElectrically conductive normal metal for stability and protection--\nCu, Al, or Ag\nHigh-strength metal for mechanical integrity--high-strength metal,\nor work-hardened Cu also used as stabilizer.\nCoolant\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nDesigner's Goal\nMaximize overall (or engineering) current density, Jover (or Je),\nand still satisfying requirements of:\nStability; protection; mechanical integrity; and cost --\nfor commercially viable units\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nTypes of Magnet\nBasically there are two types of magnet:\nI. High-performance (\"Adiabatic\")\nII. Cryostable\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nI.\nHigh-performance\nJover enhanced by:\nCombining superconductor and high-strength normal\nmetal (stability; protection; mechanical).\nEliminating local coolant* and impregnating the entire\nwinding space unoccupied by conductor with epoxy,\nmaking the entire winding as one monolithic structural entity.\n(Presence of cooling in the winding makes the winding\nmechanically weak and takes up the conductor space.)\nHigh-performance approach universally used for NMR, MRI,\nHEP dipoles & quadrupoles in which R×J×B manageable with a\ncombination of \"composite conductor\" & \"monolithic entity.\"\n* The conductor always requires cooling but not necessarily exposed\ndirectly to the coolant.\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\n\"Adiabatic\" Windings\n1. Bath Cooled\nWinding immersed in a bath of cryogen\nWork-hardened stabilizer or reinforcement added\nExamples: NMR; MRI\nEpoxy Impregnation\nCryogen (He, N2)\nCoil Form\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\"Adiabatic\" Windings (Continued)\nCryogen forced through pipe\n2. Forced-Flow Cryogen\nWinding \"globally\" cooled by forced-flow single-phase cryogen\nWork-hardened stabilizer or reinforcement added\nExamples: HEP diploes & quadrupoles\n\n\"Adiabatic\" Windings (Continued)\n3. Cryocooler-cooled\nWinding conduction cooled by a cryocooler\nWork-hardened stabilizer or reinforcement added\nExamples: \"Dry\" research-purpose magnets (up to 15 T)\nCryocooler\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nII. Cryostable\nCharacterized by the presence of local or \"near-local\" cooling.\nNearly universally adapted winding configuration for those magnets\nthat must \"guarantee\" performance. These include \"large\"\nresearch-purpose high-field magnets, e.g., MIT Hybrid III, and those\nthat are key components of the experimental devices, e.g., fusion.\nThere are two types of cryostable magnets:\n1. Magnets with \"small\" R×J×B (and o.d. typically <1 m), \"composite\nconductor,\" i.e. combination of superconductor and work-hardened\nnormal metal (stability; protection; mechanical), sufficient to meet\nmechanical requirements despite the presence of coolant space.\n2. Magnets with \"large\" R×J×B (and o.d. typically >1 m), e.g., Fusion\nmagnets, \"composite conductor,\" no longer sufficient to meet\nmechanical requirements; CICC (cable-in-conduit conductor) or\nreinforced composite/forced cooling.\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nCryostable Winding\n1. Cryogen Well-Ventilated within Winding\nWork-hardened stabilizer\nExamples: Many \"large\" magnets of the 1960s-1990s, including\nMIT 35-T Hybrid; LHD TF coil\nTurn-to-turn segment occupied by insulating spacers\nCryogen\nSegment not occupied by insulating spacers\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nCryostable Winding (Continued)\n2. CICC (Cable-in-Conduit Conductor)\nSingle-phase cryogen forced through conduit that\ncontains cabled Superconductor/stabilizer composite\nConduit (steel alloy) reinforces the conductor\nExamples: Most fusion magnets; NHMFL 45-T hybrid\nForced single-phase cryogen\nConduit\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nCryostable Winding (Continued)\n3. Reinforced Composite & Forced-Flow Single-Phase Cryogen\nSingle-phase cryogen forced through a set of pipes placed near\nthe winding comprises of reinforced composite\nExample: CMS magnet of the LHC\nReinforced composite\nSingle-phase cryogen\nY. Iwasa (04/03/03)\n\nCICC\nCabled strands of superconductor encased in a conduit, which provides\nmechanical strength and through which single-phase cryogen\n(generally helium) is forced to provide cooling to the superconductor\nAdvantage\nIntegrates key requirements of a superconductor--current-carrying\ncapacity; stability & protection; AC losses; mechanical integrity--in\na single conductor configuration.\nDisadvantage\nBecause of the non-current carrying space occupied by the conduit\nand cryogen, Iop should be \"large\" to keep Jover \"reasonable.\"\nGenerally, Iop >10 kA; occasionally Iop> a few kA.\nSuitable Applications\n\"High\" field and \"large\" volume magnets, i.e., fusion; SMES.\nY.
