  "course_description": "Studies synthesis of polymeric materials, emphasizing interrelationships of chemical pathways, process conditions, and microarchitecture of molecules produced. Chemical pathways include traditional approaches such as anionic polymerization, radical condensation, and ring-opening polymerizations. Other techniques are discussed, including stable free radical polymerizations and atom transfer free radical polymerizations (ARTP), catalytic approaches to well-defined architectures, and polymer functionalization in bulk and at surfaces. Process conditions include bulk, solution, emulsion, suspension, gas phase, and batch vs. continuous fluidized bed. Microarchitecture includes tacticity, molecular-weight distribution, sequence distributions in copolymers, errors in chains such as branches, head-to-head addition, and peroxide incorporation.\nAcknowledgements\nThe instructor would like to thank Karen Shu and Karen Daniel for their work in preparing material for this course site.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nDescription\n\nIn this Chemical Engineering graduate level course, basic methods in the synthesis of polymers are addressed and discussed, including the various types of polymerizations and their applications toward both common and new promising polymer products. This class presents the most common synthetic methods used in polymerization, the basic differences in the kinetics of these methods, the final end-products obtained, and the synthetic processing techniques that might be used for various applications.\n\nNew and developing approaches to polymerization such as atom transfer free radical and \"living\" free radical methods are addressed using literature references and class discussion. Throughout the course, general materials and engineering design concepts are introduced, as well as the manipulation of polymer structure and processing to obtain desired properties. In the class, we emphasize the use of chemistry as a tool for the development of new materials or the modification of existing polymer systems. For this reason, the course covers functionalization of polymers, including polymer surface modification for applications requiring improved adhesive, frictional, or reactive properties. The use of self-assembly in the formation of macromolecular structures using hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and other non-covalent bonds is discussed at the end of the course by means of examples from the literature and classroom discussion. A design project is introduced at the middle of the term as a means of engaging students in their own research interests.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis course assumes knowledge of organic chemistry (\n5.12\nand\n5.13\n) and thermodynamics and kinetics (\n5.60\n).\n\nTexts\n\nOdian, George.\nPrinciples of Polymerization\n. 4th ed. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Interscience, 2004. ISBN: 9780471274001.\n\nSupplementary Handouts will be used frequently and will be handed out in lecture as needed during the course.\n\nGrading\n\nThere will be three hour-long exams, open book and notes. Each exam will be worth 25% of the class credit. There will be occasional problem sets, which will be worth a total of 5% credit. A final design project paper will be due at the end of the term, worth 20% credit. The details of the design project can be found in\nprojects\n.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nProblem Sets\n\n5%\n\nDesign Project\n\n20%\n\nExam 1\n\n25%\n\nExam 2\n\n25%\n\nExam 3\n\n25%\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nCourse Overview\n\nPolymer Design and Synthesis\n\nReaction Types and Processes\n\nIntroduction to Step Growth\n\nStep Growth Polymerization\n\nMolecular Weight (MW) Control\n\nMolecular Weight Distribution (MWD) in Equilibrium Step Condensation Polymerizations\n\nInterchange Reactions: Effects on Processing and Product\n\nApplication Example: Common Polyesters\n\nStep Growth Polymerization\n\nTypes of Monomers\n\nKinetics and Equilibrium Considerations\n\nClosed vs. Open Systems\n\nCommon Processing Approaches\n\nNear-equilibrium vs. Far from Equilibrium\n\nHomogeneous Solution and Bulk Polymerization\n\nInterfacial Polymerizations\n\nApplication Examples: Polyamides\n\nProblem set 1 out\n\nOther Polymers of Interest Obtained by Step-Growth\n\nPolyaramids\n\nPolyimides\n\nSegmented and Block Copolymers from Step Condensation Methods\n\nCrosslinking and Branching\n\nNetwork Formation and Gelation\n\nCarothers Equation: P\nn\nApproach\n\nNetwork Formation\n\nStatistical Approach: P\nw\nApproach\n\nA Word on MWD for Nonlinear Polymerizations\n\nStep-by-Step Approaches I: Polypeptide Synthesis: Examples from Biology\n\nStep-by-Step Approaches II: Dendrimers\n\nTraditional Convergent and Divergent Routes\n\nNew \"one-pot\" Approaches to Hyperbranced Species\n\nProblem set 1 due\n\nExam 1 (Step Growth): Lectures 1-9 (Two Days After Ses #9)\n\nFree Radical Chain Polymerization\n\nIntroduction to Radical Polymerization\n\nRadical Polymerization\n\nHomogeneous Reaction Rate Kinetics\n\nFree Radical Kinetic Chain Length\n\nMWD\n\nChain Transfer\n\nEnergetics\n\nProblem set 2 out\n\nExam 2 practice problems out\n\nThermodynamics of Free Radical Polymerizations\n\nCeiling T's\n\nTromsdorff Effect\n\nInstantaneous P\nn\n\nProcessing Approaches: Emulsion Polymerization Processes\n\nProcessing Approaches: Suspension (Bead) Polymerization Processes\n\nPolyvinyl Chloride Via Precipitation Polymerization\n\nPolyethylene Via Radical Polymerization\n\nZiegler-Natta Catalysis\n\nStereochemistry of Polymers\n\nProblem set 2 due\n\nStereoregular Polymerizations\n\nRadical Copolymerization: Alternating to Block Copolymers\n\nExam 2 (Free-Radical Chain): Lectures 12-18 (Two Days After Ses #18)\n\nIonic Polymerization\n\nMetallocene Chemistry\n\nIntroduction to New Developments from Brookhart, et al.\n\nDesign project: project description distributed\n\nIntroduction to Anionic Polymerization\n\nMonomers Applicable to Anionic Methods\n\nKinetics of \"Nonliving\" Anionic Polymerization\n\nLiving Anionic Polymerization\n\nEffects of Initiator and Solvent\n\nAnionic Block Copolymerization\n\nProblem set 3 out\n\nAnionic Ring Opening Polymerization\n\nEnd Group Functionalization\n\nTelechelic Oligomers and Novel Architectures Using Coupling Techniques\n\nIntroduction to Cationic Polymerization, Monomers, Kinetics\n\n\"Living\" Cationic Polymerizations\n\nExamples of Cationic Polymerization, Isobutyl Rubber Synthesis, Polyvinyl Ethers\n\nAnionic Ring Opening Polymerization\n\nCationic Ring Opening Polymerization\n\nOther Ring Opening Polymerizations\n\nProblem set 3 due\n\nPolysiloxanes, Lactams, etc.\n\nExam 3 (Ionic): Lectures 20-27 (Three Days After Ses #27)\n\nPolymer Functionalization and Modification\n\nIntroduction to Polymer Functionalization: Motivations, Yield, Crystallinity, Solubility Issues\n\nCommon Functionalization Approaches\n\nFunctionalization Case Studies: Biomaterials Systems, Liquid Crystal (LC) Polymers\n\nLess Traditional Approaches to Polymer Synthesis\n\nSurface Functionalization of Polymers\n\nGraft Copolymerization\n\nApproaches to Making Comb and Graft Architectures\n\nGrafting onto Existing Polymer Surfaces\n\nSurface Engineering Using Graft Copolymers\n\n\"Living\" Free Radical Approaches: Stable Free Radical Polymerization, Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP)\n\nATRP\n\nRAFT and Other New Methods\n\nRing Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP)\n\nROMP\n\nOxidative Coupling\n\nElectrochemical Polymerizations\n\nCase Study: Electro-active Polymers\n\nInorganic Polymer Synthesis\n\nMacromolecular Systems Via Secondary Bonding: Use of H-bonding and Ionic Charge to Build Structures\n\nConcept of Self-Assembly - From Primary Structure to Complex Structure\n\nDesign project due",
