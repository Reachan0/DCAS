  "course_description": "This course covers, with a focus on both theory and empirics, advanced topics in international trade (as well as inter-regional trade and economic geography.) It includes the study of positive issues, such as: Why do countries trade? What goods do countries trade? What are the implications of openness for the location of production, industries, occupations, and innovative activity? And, what impedes trade and why do some countries deliberately erect policy impediments to trade? The course also concerns normative issues, such as: Is trade openness beneficial to a representative agent? And, are there winners and losers from trade and if so, can we identify them? Throughout, these issues are approached in neoclassical settings as well as those with market failures, at the industry-level as well as the firm-level, and in the presence of both mobile and immobile factors (e.g., FDI, offshoring of tasks, multinational firms and immigration).",

Arnaud Costinot (AC) will primarily cover the theoretical side of each topics and Dave Donaldson (DD) the empirical side. The order of theory and empirical coverage of a topic will change, reflecting work on each topic.\n\nSection I: Core Models of International Trade\n\nWe begin with the simplest approach to trade theory: trade among constant returns to scale, perfectly competitive economies. Here we first study, in completely general production settings, the conditions under which trading is Pareto efficient ('Gains from Trade') and the predictions about who will trade what with whom (leading to the 'Law of Comparative Advantage'). Then we move on to models that restrict the supply side in different manners (Ricardian, Heckscher-Ohlin and Ricardo-Viner) in order to generate richer predictions about what will happen when economies trade. We next examine models of international trade in which countries trade purely to exploit economies of scale, and in which production is imperfectly competitive. This approach allows one to speak coherently about a model's predictions at the firm-level. Because this body of theoretical work was heavily influenced by the arrival of firm-level datasets (in the mid-1990s) we begin with a discussion of those findings. Workhorse versions of all of the models discussed up to this point (neoclassical or otherwise) typically predict that trade flows take the 'gravity equation' form. We therefore, finally, discuss the conditions under which a model is therefore a 'gravity model' and relate this to the enormous body of work that estimates gravity equations using trade data (often to shed light on the magnitude of various barriers to trade).\n\nSee Section I topics in the\nCalendar\nsection.\n\nSection II: Miscellaneious Topics in Trade\n\nThe remainder of the course will cover a series of unconnected topics that extend the above ideas to specific applications of interest. These include: methods to measure trade costs; the consequences of an ability to trade inputs to the production process such as intermediate goods/tasks (offshoring and fragmentation); and what sorts of trade policy we should expect to see if policymakers are self-interested (political economy of trade policy) and if countries set trade policy under various noncooperative or cooperative regimes (the WTO).\n\nSee Section II topics in the\nCalendar\nsection.",

      "content": "14.581 International Trade\nClass notes on 2/6/20131\nStandard Assumptions of International Trade\nThe theory of international trade can be thought of as applied general equilib-\nrium theory. What distinguishes trade theory from abstract general-equilibrium\nanalysis is the existence of a hierarchical market structure, i.e. the \"Interna-\ntional\" goods markets, and the \"domestic\" factor markets.\nIn most of the trade models, \"goods\" and \"factors\" are distinguished in the\nfollowing sense:\nGoods enter consumers'utility functions directly, are elastically supplied and\ndemanded, and can be freely traded internationally (mobile). Factors only a¤ect\nutility through the income they generate, they are in ...xed supply domestically,\nand they cannot be traded at all (imobile).\nFor example, in the Heckscher-Ohlin model we will see in a couple of weeks,\nit is the di¤erence in factor endowments across countries that is considered as\nsources of comparative advantage. In trade models, we consider the trade of\ngoods, not factors.\nThe central issues in international trade are: 1. How does the intergration\nof good markets a¤ect good prices? 2. How do changes in good prices, in turn,\na¤ect factor prices, factor allocation, production, and welfare?\nTrade models usually emphasize the supply side, and are silent on demand\nside. That is, trade ++ows are driven by productivity di¤erences (Ricardo), fac-\ntor endowments (Heckscher-Ohlin), increasing returns (Krugman, 1979) or ...rm\nheterogeneity (Melitz, 2003), but are not due to di¤erentiated tastes for con-\nsumption goods across countries. Therefore, we will often assume that: con-\nsumers have identical homothetic preferences in each country (the existence of\nrepresentative agent). Also, most of the trade models are static and only con-\nsider the long-run view, hence what exactly the time the model applies is not\nnecessarily clear. By contrast, international macro usually focuses on dynamic\nmodels.\nThese basic assumptions look very strong, but they can be dealt with by\nclever reinterpretations of the model. For instance, transport costs could be\nhandled by interpreting one of the good as transportation services. Factor mo-\nbility could be dealt with by de...ning as a good anything that can be traded.\nGoods and factors can be distinguished by locations, time, and states of nature.\nIf you have already taken the international macro class (14.582), you should\nrecall how we dealt with intertemporal trade problems by considering the same\ngoods produced at di¤erent time as di¤erentiated goods.\n1The notes are based on lecture slides with inclusion of important insights emphasized\nduring the class.\n\nStandard Assumptions of Neoclassical Trade\nNeoclassic trade models are characterized by three key assumptions:\n1. Perfect competition\n2. Constant returns to scale (CRS)\n3. No distortions\nNote that we could allow for decreasing returns to scale (DRS) by introducing\nhidden factors in ...xed supply. Increasing returns to scale (IRS) is a much\nmore severe issue addressed by \"New\" trade theory. (Krugman, 1979, 1980)\nGeneral Results of Neoclassical Trade\nNot surprisingly, there are few results that can be derived using only Assump-\ntions 1-3. In future lectures, we will enrich the model with more assumptions and\nderive sharp predictions for special cases: Ricardo, Assignment, Ricardo-Viner,\nand Heckscher-Ohlin models. For the moment, let's stick to the general case\nand show how simple revealed preference arguments can be used to establish\ntwo important resutls.\n3.1\nGains from trade (Samuelson 1939)\nConsider a world economy with n = 1; :::; N countries, each populated by h =\n1; :::; Hn households\nThere are g = 1; :::; G goods:\nyn (yn\n1 ; :::; yn\nG) Output vector in country n\ncnh (cnh\nnh\n1 ; :::; cG ) Consumption vector of household h in country n\npn (pn\n1; :::; pn\nG) Good price vector in country n\nThere are f = 1; :::; F factors:\nvn (vn\nn\n1 ; :::; vF ) Endowment vector in country n\nwn (wn\n1 ; :::; wn\nF ) Factor price vector in country n\nWe denote by\nn the set of combinations (y; v) feasible in country n\nCRS )\nn is a convex cone\nRevenue function in country n is de...ned as\nrn(p; v) max fpyj(y; v)\ny\nng\nComments (see Dixit-Norman pp. 31-36 for details):\n\nRevenue function summarizes all relevant properties of technology\nUnder perfect competition, yn maximizes the value of output in country\nn:\nrn(pn; vn) = pnyn\n(1)\nThe expenditure function\nWe denote by unh the utility function of household h in country n\nExpenditure function for household h in country n is de...ned as\nenh(p; u) = min\n\npcjunh (c)\nc\nu\nComments (see Dixit-Norman pp. 59-64 for details):\n\nHere factor endowments are in ...xed supply, but easy to generalize to case\nwhere households choose factor supply optimally\nHolding p ...xed, enh(p; u) is increasing in u\nHousehold's optimization implies\nenh(pn; unh) = pncnh,\n(2)\nwhere cnh and unh are the consumption and utility level of the household\nin equilibrium, respectively\nIn the next propositions, when we say \"in a neoclassical trade model,\" we\nmean in a model where equations (1) and (2) hold in any equilibrium\n3.1.1\nOne household per country\nConsider ...rst the case where there is just one household per country\nWithout risk of confusion, we drop h and n from all variables\nInstead we denote by:\n(ya; ca; pa) the vector of output, consumption, and good prices under au-\ntarky\n(y; c; p) the vector of output, consumption, and good prices under free\ntrade\nua and u the utility levels under autarky and free trade\nProposition 1 In a neoclassical trade model with one household per country,\nfree trade makes all households (weakly) better o¤.\nProof:\ne(p; ua) pca,\nby de...nition of e\n= pya\nby market clearing under autarky\nr (p; v)\nby de...nition of r\n= e (p; u)\nby equations (1), (2), and trade balance\nSince e(p; ) increasing, we get u ua\nComments:\n\nP\nPa\nFigure 1: Fig 1\nTwo inequalities in the previous proof correspond to consumption and\nproduction gains from trade (See Fig 1). Facing the new price vector,\nhouseholds cannot be worse by reoptimizing consumption and production.\nPrevious inequalities are weak. Equality holds if there are kinks in IC or\nPPF, for example, if production function or utility are Leontif, or if we\nhave an endowment economy.\nTrade here acts as an expansion of production possibility frontier. Previ-\nous proposition only establishes that households always prefer \"free trade\"\nto \"autarky.\" It does not say anything about the comparisons of trade\nequilibria.\n3.1.2\nMultiple households per country (I): domestic lump-sum trans-\nfers\nWith multiple-households, moving away from autarky is likely to create winners\nand losers. households already trade among themselves within country may not\nsee their utility increased when the country is opening up to trade. For instance,\nconsider some household holds a bunch of special metal which were selling at a\nhigh price under autarky. When the country starts trading with another country\nthat is abundant in this kind of metal. The drop of the relative price of metal\nimplies a lower income for this household, which in turn may result in a lower\nutility.\nIn order to establish the Pareto-superiority of trade, we will therefore need\nto allow for policy instruments. We start with domestic lump-sum transfers\n\n(full ++exibility) and then consider less informationally intensive instruments.\nWe now reintroduce the index h explicitly and denote by:\ncah and ch the vector of consumption of household h under autarky and\nfree trade\nvah and vh the vector of endowments of household h under autarky and\nfree trade\nuah and uh the utility levels of household h under autarky and free trade\nh the lump-sum transfer from the government to household h ( h 0 ,\nlump-sum tax and h 0 , lump-sum subsidy)\nProposition 2 In a neoclassical trade model with multiple households per\ncountry, there exist domestic lump-sum transfers such that free trade is (weakly)\nPareto superior to autarky in all countries\nProof: We proceed in two steps\nStep 1: For any h, set the lump-sum transfer h such that\nh = (p pa) cah (w wa)vh\nThe intuition here is that, after opening up trade, household should still be\nable to purchase the same consumption vector in autarky. Budget constraint\nunder autarky implies pacah wavh. Therefore\npcah wvh + h\nThus cah is still in the budget set of household h under free trade\nStep 2: By de...nition, government's revenue is given by\nP h = (pa p) P cah (wa w)\nvh\n: de...nition of h\n= (pa p) ya\na\n(wa w)v\n: mc autarky\n= py + wv\nP\n: zp autarky\nr (p; v) + wv\n: de...nition r (p; v)\n= (py wv) = 0\n: eq. (1) + zp free trade\nComments:\nGood to know we don't need international lump-sum transfers.\nDomestic lump-sum transfers remain informationally intensive. How can\nthe government know the consumption vector cah for each household under\nautarky?\n\n3.1.3\nMultiple households per country (II): commodity and factor\ntaxation\nWith this last comment in mind, we now restrict the set of instruments to\ncommodity and factor taxes/subsidies. More speci...cally, suppose that the gov-\nernment can a¤ect the prices faced by all households under free trade by setting\ngood and factor\nhousehold\ngood\np\n=\np +\nhousehold\nfactor\nw\n=\nw +\nProposition 3 In a neoclassical trade model with multiple households per\ncountry, there exist commodity and factor taxes/subsidies such that free trade is\n(weakly) Pareto superior to autarky in all countries\nProof: Consider the two following taxes:\ngood\n\n= pa p\nfactor\n\n= wa w\nBy construction, household is indi¤erent between autarky and free trade.\nNow consider government's revenues. By de...nition\nP h\ngood\nf\n=\n\nP\nactor\nP\ncah\na\n\nP vh\n=\n(p p)\ncah (wa w)\nfor the same reason as in the previous proof.\nP vh 0,\nComments:\nPrevious argument only relies on the existence of production gains from\ntrade. This means that the whole proof fails if there only exists consump-\ntion gains, e.g. endowment economy.\nIf there is a kink in the PPF, we know that there aren't any production\ngains.\nSimilar problem with \"moving costs\". See Feenstra p.185\nFactor taxation still informationally intensive: need to know endowments\nper e¢ ciency units, may lead to di¤erent business taxes\n3.2\nLaw of Comparative Advantage (Deardor¤ 1980)\nThe previous results have focused on normative predictions. We now demon-\nstrate how the same revealed preference argument can be used to make positive\npredictions about the pattern of trade\nPrinciple of comparative advantage:\nComparative advantage-- meaning di¤erences in relative autarky prices-- is\nthe basis for trade\n\nWhy? If two countries have the same autarky prices, then after opening\nup to trade, the autarky prices remain equilibrium prices. So there will be no\ntrade....\nThe law of comparative advantage (in words):\nCountries tend to export goods in which they have a CA, i.e. lower relative\nautarky prices compPared to other countries\nLet tn yn\n1 cnh; :::; yn\nG P cnh\ndenote net exports in country n\nLet uan and un denote the utility level of the representative household in\ncountry n under autarky and free trade\nLet pan denote the vector of autarky prices in country n\nWithout loss of generality, normalize prices such that:\nP pg = P pan\ng\n= 1,\nNotations:\np cov (x; y)\ncor (x; y)\n=\nPvar (x) var (y)\nn\ncov (x; y)\n=\ni=1 (xi x) (yi y)\nn\nx\n=\nn\ni=1 xi\nProposition 4 In a neoclassical t\nP\nrade model, if there is a representative\nhousehold in country n, then cor (p pa; tn) 0\nProof: Since (yn; vn) 2\nn, the de...nition of r implies\npayn r (pa; vn)\nSince un (cn) = un, the de...nition of e implies\npacn e (pa; un)\nThe two previous inequalities imply\npatn r (pa; vn) e (pa; un)\n(3)\nSince un uan by Proposition 1, e (pa; ) increasing implies\ne(pa; un) e(pa; una)\n(4)\nCombining inequalities (3) and (4), we obtain\npatn r (pa; vn) e(pa; una) = 0,\nwhere the equality comes from market clearing under autarky.\nBecause of balanced trade, we know that\nptn = 0\n\nHence\n(p pa) tn 0\nBy de...nition,\nn\ncov (p pa; tn) = P\na\na\nn\ng\nwhic\npg pg p + p\ntg t\nh can be rearranged as\n\n,\ncov (p pa; tn) = (p pa) tn G (p pa\nn\n) t\nGiven our price normalization, we know that p = pa. Hence\ncov (p pa; tn) = (p pa) tn 0\nProposition 4 derives from this observation and the fact that\nsign [cor (p pa; tn)] = sign [cov (p pa; tn)]\nComments:\nWith 2 goods, each country exports the good in which it has a CA, but\nwith more goods, this is just a correlation\nCore of the proof is the observation that patn 0\nIt directly derives from the fact that there are gains from trade. Since free\ntrade is better than autarky, the vector of consumptions must be at most\nbarely attainable under autarky (payn pacn)\nFor empirical purposes, problem is that we rarely observe autarky...\nIn future lectures, we will look at models which relate pa to (observable)\nprimitives of the model: technology and factor endowments\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.581 International Economics I\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "14.581 International Trade\nClass notes on 2/11/20131\nTaxonomy of Neoclassical Trade Models\nIn a neoclassical trade model, comparative advantage, i.e. di¤erences in relative\nautarky prices, is the rationale for trade\nDi¤erences in autarky prices may have two origins: Demand (periphery of\nthe ...eld) or Supply (core of the ...eld). On the supply side, autarky prices are\nrooted from two di¤erent sources in the models we will learn. The Ricardian\ntheory assumes technological di¤erences as sources of comparative advantages.\nThe Factor proportion theory (HO model) assumes factor endowment\ndi¤erences as sources of comparative advantages.\nIn order to shed light on\nthe role of technological and factor endowment di¤erences. Ricardian theory\nassumes only one factor of production, while factor proportion theory rules out\ntechnological di¤erences.\nHowever, neither set of assumptions is realistic, both may be useful depend-\ning on the question one tries to answer. For instance, if you want to understand\nthe impact of the rise of China on real wages in the US, Ricardian theory is the\nnatural place to start. You could study the comparative statics on a technology\ncatch-up or an increase in population in China. If you want to study its e¤ects\non the skill premium, more factors will be needed, so factor proportion theory\nwill be helpful.\nNote that in both theories, technological and factor endowment di¤erences\nare exogenously given, we will not intend to study the relationship between\ntechnology and factor endowments (e.g.\nskill-biased technological change in\ngrowth literature)\nStandard Ricardian Model (DFS 1977)\nConsider a world economy with two countries: Home and Foreign. Asterisks\ndenote variables related to the Foreign country. Ricardian models di¤er from\nother neoclassical trade models in that there only is one factor of production\n- labor. Equivalently, you can think that there are many (nontradable) fac-\ntors, but that they can all be aggregated into a single composite, namely, there\nshouldn't be factor intensity di¤erences. We denote by:\nL and L the endowments of labor (in e¢ ciency units) in the two countries\nw and w the wages (in e¢ ciency units) in the two countries\n1The notes are based on lecture slides with inclusion of important insights emphasized\nduring the class.\n\n2.1\nSupply-side assumptions\nThere is a continuum of goods indexed by z 2 [0; 1]\nSince there are CRS, we can de...ne the (constant) unit labor requirements\nin both countries: a (z) and a (z). a (z) and a (z) capture all we need to know\nabout technology in the two countries.\nWithout loss of generality, we order\ngoods such that\na(z)\nA (z)\na(z) is decreasing. Hence Home has a comparative\nadvantage in the low-z goods. For simplicity, we'll assume strict monotonicity.\n2.2\nFree trade equilibrium: E¢ cient international special-\nization\nPrevious supply-side assumptions are all we need to make qualitative predictions\nabout pattern of trade. Let p (z) denote the price of good z under free trade.\nPro...t-maximization requires\np (z) wa (z)\n\n0, with equality if z is produced at Home\n(1)\np (z) wa (z)\n\n0, with equality if z is produced Abroad\n(2)\nProposition There exists ze 2 [0; 1] such that Home produces all goods z < z\nand Foreign produces all goods ze > z\nProof: By contradiction.\nSuppose that there exists z0 < z such that z\nproduced at Home and z\ne\n0 is produced abroad. (1) and (2) imply\np (z) wa (z)\n=\np (z0) wa (z0)\n\np (z0) wa (z0)\n=\np (z) wa (z)\n\nThis implies\nwa (z) wa (z0) = p (z) p (z0) wa (z0) wa (z) ;\nwhich can be rearranged as\na (z0) =a (z0) a (z) =a (z)\nThis contradicts A strictly decreasing.\nProposition simply states that Home should produce and specialize in the\ngoods in which it has a CA. Note that the proposition does not rely on continuum\nof goods, but continuum of goods + continuity of A is important to derive\nw\nA (z) = w !\n(3)\nEquation (3) is the ...rst of DFS'\ne\ns two equilibrium conditions: conditional on\nwages, goods should be produced in the country where it is cheaper to do so.\nTo complete characterization of free trade equilibrium, we need look at the\ndemand side to pin down the relative wage !\n\n2.3\nDemand-side assumptions\nConsumers have identical Cobb-Douglas pref around the world\nWe denote by b (z) 2 (0; 1) the share of expenditure on good z:\np (z) c (z)\np (z) c (z)\nb(z) =\n=\nwL\nwL\nwhere c (z) and c (z) are consumptions at Home and Abroad. By de...nition,\nshare of expenditure satisfy:\nZ\nb (z) dz = 1\n2.4\nFree trade equilibrium (II): trade balance\nz\nLet us denote by (z)\nZ\ne\ne\nb (z) the fraction of income spent (in both countries)\non goods produced at Home\nTrade balance requires\n(ze) wL = [1 (z)] wL\nwhere, LHS Home exports; RHS Home\ne\nimports\nPrevious equation can be rearranged as\n(ze)\nL\n! =\n(\n1 ( )\nL\n\nB z)\n(4)\nz\nNote that B0 > 0: an increase in z leads to a trade\ne\nsurplus at Home, which\nmust be compensated by an increase\ne\nin Home's relative wage !, so that foreign-\ners will spend relatively less on Home\ne\ngoods.\nPutting things together\nF\nH\n~\nz\nω\nB(z)\nz\nA(z)\nE¢ cient international specialization, Equation (3), and trade balance, (4),\njointly determine (z; !).\nWith these two\ne\nequilibrium conditions, we can study various interesting\nquestions:\n\nWhat happens when one country's technology catch up?\nWhat happens if one country's population grows faster?\nWhat happens if there is trade imbalances?\nSince Ricardian model is a neoclassical model, general results derived in\nprevious lecture hold. However, one can directly show the existence of gains\nfrom trade in this environment\nArgument:\nSet w = 1 under autarky and free trade\nIndirect utility of Home representative household only depends on p ()\nFor goods z produced at Home under free trade: no change compared to\nautarky\nFor goods z produced Abroad under free trade: p (z) = wa (z) < a (z)\nSince all prices go down, indirect utility must go up\n2.4.1\nWhat Are the Consequences of (Relative) Country Growth?\nF\nH\n~\nz\nω\nB(z)\nz\nA(z)\nSuppose that L=L goes up (rise of China):\n! goes up and ze goes down\nAt initial wages, an increase in L=L creates a trade de...cit Abroad, which\nmust be compensated by an increase in !\nIncrease in L=L raises indirect utility, i.e.\nreal wage, of representative\nhousehold at Home and lowers it Abroad:\n\nSet w = 1 before and after the change in L=L\nFor goods z whose production remains at Home: no change in p (z)\nFor goods z whose production remains Abroad: ! %) w &) p (z) =\nwa (z) &\nFor goods z whose production moves Abroad: wa (z) a (z) ) p (z) &\nSo Home gains. Similar logic implies welfare loss Abroad\nComments:\nIn spite of CRS at the industry-level, everything is as if we had DRS at\nthe country-level\nAs Foreign's size increases, it specializes in sectors in which it is relatively\nless productive (compared to Home), which worsens its terms-of trade,\nand so, lowers real GDP per capita\nThe ++atter the A schedule, the smaller this e¤ect\n2.4.2\nWhat are the Consequences of Technological Change?\nThere are many ways to model technological change:\nGlobal uniform technological change: for all z, a (z) =\nForeign uniform technological change: for all z\nb\n, a (z)\nx >\nba (z) = x > 0\n= 0, but a (z) =\nb\nb\nInternational transfer of the most e¢ cient technology: for all z, a(z) =\na (z) (O¤shoring? US companies are setting shops in China, they are\nusing the same U.S. technology.)\nUsing the same logic as in the previous comparative static exercise, one can\neasily check that:\nGlobal uniform technological change increases welfare everywhere\nForeign uniform technological change increases welfare everywhere (For\nForeign, this depends on Cobb-Douglas assumption)\nIf Home has the most e¢ cient technology, a(z) < a (z) initially, then it\nwill lose from international transfer (no gains from trade). O¤shoring is a\nbad thing if there is technology transfer.\n\n2.4.3\nTransfer problem\nThe debate centers around whether there exists general equilibrium e¤ects after\na transfer of money from one country to another. Suppose Germany need to\nmake 1 billion dollars payment to France. Keyesian thought that there is no\ngeneral equilibrium e¤ects, the burden for Germany is just the one billion dol-\nlars per se. However, if consumption preferences are di¤erent in Germany and\nFrance, or in particular, if consumption is home-biased. Then relative demand\nfor French good will increase, which will deterioriate the terms of trade for Ger-\nmany, which in turn, will imply that the burden for Germany is more than 1\nbillion dollars.\nThis problem can be analyzed in our simple Ricardian model:\nSuppose that there is T > 0 such that:\nHome's income is equal to wL + T,\nForeign's income is equal to wL T\nIf preferences are identical in both countries, transfers do not a¤ect the trade\nbalance condition:\n[1 (ze)] (wL + T) (ze) (wL T) = T\n,\n(ze) wL = [1 (z)] wL\nSo there are no terms-of-trade e¤ect.\nHowever, if Home consumption is biased tow\ne\nards Home goods, (z) > (z)\nfor all z, then transfer further improves Home's terms-of trade.\nSee Dekle,\nEaton, and Kortum (2007) for a recent application, where they think of trade\nimbalances as transfers. They investigated if these trade imbalances are cor-\nrected, what would be the change in terms of trade.\nMulti-country extensions\nDFS 1977 provides extremely elegant version of the Ricardian model: Charac-\nterization of free trade equilibrium boils down to ...nding (z; !) using e¢ cient\ninternational specialization and trade balance\nThe problem is that this approach does not easily extend\ne\nto economies with\nmore than two countries. In the two-country case, each country specializes in\nthe goods in which it has a CA compared to the other country. The question is\nwho is the other country if there are more than 2?\nMulti-country extensions of the Ricardian model:\nJones (1961),\nCostinot (2009), Wilson (1980), Eaton and Kortum (2002) [Next Lecture]\n\n3.1\nJones (1961)\nAssume N countries, G goods\nTrick: restrict attention to situations where each country only produces one\ngood (\"Assignment\") and characterize the properties of optimal assignment\nMain result: Optimal assignment of countries to goods will minimize the\nproduct of their unit labor requirements\nTo get some intuitions, let's think of the case where N = G.\nIn each country, the value of marginal product of labor must be maximized\nin that country. If country n produces z, then\np(z)=a(z) p(z0)=a(z0) for all z0\nHence,\nY p(z)\np\n\nall\na(z)\nY\n(z0) for\nassignments of z0\na(z0)\nN\nN\nY\nY\na(z)\nN\n\na(z0)\nN\nY\na(z)\nY\na(z0)\nN\nN\nwhich boils down to a minimization problem of the product of their unit\nlabor requirements.\n3.2\nCostinot (2009)\nAssume N countries, G goods\nTrick: put enough structure on the variation of unit-labor requirements\nacross countries and industries to bring back two-country intuition\nSuppose that:\ncountries i = 1; :::; N countries have characteristics i 2 goods g = 1; :::; G countries have characteristics g 2 a (; ) unit labor requirement in -sector and -country\nDe...nition a (; ) is strictly log-submodular if for any > 0 and > 0,\na (; ) a (0; 0) < a (; 0) a (0; )\nIf a is strictly positive, this can be rearranged as\na (; )/ a (0; ) < a (; 0)/ a (0; 0)\nIn other words, high- countries have a comparative advantage in high-\nsectors. can be though of as capturing the rule of law, the quality of insti-\ntution, or the enforcement of contract. can be considered as the complexity\n\nof goods. In this abstract model, we assume that high quality institutions have\ncomparative advantage in producing more complex goods.\nExample: In Krugman (1986), a (s; c) exp (sc), where s is an index\nof good s's \"technological intensity\"and c is a measure of country c's closeness\nto the world \"technological frontier\"\nProposition If a (; ) is log-submodular, then high- countries specialize\nin high- sectors\nProof: By contradiction. Suppose that there exists > 0 and > 0 such\nthat country produces good 0 and country 0 produces good . Then pro...t\nmaximization implies\np (0) w () a (0; )\n=\np () w () a (; )\n\np () w (0) a (; 0)\n=\np (0) w (0) a (0; 0)\n\nThis implies\na (; 0) a (0; ) a (; ) a (0; 0)\nwhich contradicts a log-submodular\n3.3\nWilson (1980)\nSame as in DFS 1977, but with multiple countries and more general preferences\nTrick: Although predicting the exact pattern of trade may be di¢ cult, one\ndoes not need to know it to make comparative static predictions\nAt the aggregate level, Ricardian model is similar to an exchange-economy\nin which countries trade their own labor for the labor of other countries. Since\nlabor supply is ...xed, changes in wages can be derived from changes in (aggre-\ngate) labor demand. Once changes in wages are known, changes in all prices,\nand hence, changes in welfare can be derived\n3.4\nEaton and Kortum (2002)\nSame as Wilson (1980), but with functional form restrictions on a (z)\nTrick: For each country i and each good z, they assume that productivity,\n1=a (z), is drawn from a Frechet distribution (This is a commonly used function\nfor discrete choice problem, which enables writing down closed form solutions\nto the model.)\nF (1=a) = exp Tia\nLike Wilson (and unlike Jones), no attempt\ntries trade, instead they focus on bilateral\nat\n\npredicting which goods coun-\ntrade ++ows and their implications\nfor wages. Unlike Wilson, trade ++ows only depends on a few parameters (Ti,).\nWill allow for calibration and counterfactual analysis\nThis paper has had a profound impact on the ...eld, we'll study it in detail\nin the next lecture.\n\nThe Origins of Technological Di¤erences Across\nCountries\nOne obvious limitation of the Ricardian model: where do productivity\ndi¤erences across countries come from?\nFor agricultural goods: Weather conditions (Portuguese vs. English wine)\nFor manufacturing goods: Why don't the most productive ...rms reproduce\ntheir production process everywhere?\n\"Institutions and Trade\"literature o¤ers answer to this question\nBasic Idea:\nEven if ...rms have access to same technological know-how around the\nworld, institutional di¤erences across countries may a¤ect how ...rms will\norganize their production process, and, in turn, their productivity\nIf institutional di¤erences a¤ect productivity relatively more in some sec-\ntors, then institutions become source of comparative advantage\nGeneral Theme: Countries with \"better institutions\"tend to be relatively\nmore productive, and so to specialize, in sectors that are more \"institutionally\ndependent\".\nExamples of Institutional Trade Theories\n1. Contract Enforcement\nAcemoglu, Antras, Helpman (2007), Antras (2005), Costinot* (2009), Levchenko\n(2007), Nunn (2007), Vogel (2007)\n2. Financial Institutions\nBeck (2000), Kletzer, Bardhan (1987), Matsuyama* (2005), Manova (2007)\n3.

Belgium has nn = 0:2, so its\ngains are GTn = 0:21=5 = 1: 38 or 38%.\n\nOne can also use the previous approach to measure the welfare gains as-\nsociated with any foreign shock, not just moving to autarky:\n!0 =!n = (0\n=nn)1=\nn\nnn\nFor more general counterfactual scenarios, however, one needs to know\nboth 0\nnn and nn.\n2.2.1\nAdding an Input-Output Loop\nImagine that intermediate goods are used to produce a composite good\nwith a CES production function with elasticity > 1.\nThis compos-\nite good can be either consumed or used to produce intermediate goods\n(input-output loop).\nEach intermediate good is produced from labor and the composite good\nwith a Cobb-Douglas technology with labor share .

Thus,\nfor nn = 0:7, = 5 and = 0:5, this implies GT\n= 0:71=10\nn\n= 1: 036 or\n3:6% gains\nComparative statics (Dekle, Eaton and Kor-\ntum, 2008)\nGo back to the simple EK model above ( = 0, = 1).

      "content": "14.581 International Trade\nClass notes on 2/20/20131\nLaw of Comparative Advantage\n1.1\nBasic Idea\n- In Lecture 1 we used a revealed preference argument to establish the ex\nistence of gains from trade\n- We now demonstrate how the same argument can be used to make positive\npredictions about the pattern of trade\n- Principle of comparative advantage:\nComparative advantage--meaning differences in relative autarky prices--\nis the basis for trade\n- Why? If two countries have the same autarky prices, then after opening\nup to trade, the autarky prices remain equilibrium prices. So there will\nbe no trade....\n- The law of comparative advantage (in words):\nCountries tend to export goods in which they have a CA, i.e. lower relative\nautarky prices compared to other countries\n1.2\nDixit-Norman-Deardorff (1980)\n\nn\n- Let tn ≡yn -\ncnh, , y\n-\ncnh denote net exports in country n\nG\nG\nan\nn\n- Let u\nand u\ndenote the utility level of the representative household in\ncountry n under autarky and free trade\nan\n- Let p\ndenote the vector of autarky prices in country n\n- Without loss of generality, normalize prices such that:\n\nan\n=\np\n= 1\npg\ng\n- Notations:\ncov (x, y)\ncor (x, y)\n=\n_\nvar (x) var (y)\nn\ncov (x, y)\n=\n(xi - x) (yi - y)\ni=1\nn\nx =\nxi\nn\ni=1\n1The notes are based on lecture slides with inclusion of important insights emphasized\nduring the class.\n\n- Recall from Lecture 1:\n- Proposition 4 In a neoclassical trade model, if there is a representative\na\nhousehold in country n, then cor (p - p , tn) ≥ 0\nTesting for Comparative Advantage\n- Principle of CA is a fundamental theoretical idea in Economics, yet testing\nit is hard. Why?\n- Problem 1: 'Principle' version is too weak to test in real world (where\nmore then 2 countries or goods).\n- Problem 2: Latent variable problem: 'Law' version is statement\nabout trading behavior but is based on autarky prices!\n- Problem 3: Periods of autarky rarely observed.\n- How to proceed? Two routes:\n1. Put a small amount of structure on the problem, as in Proposition\n4. Avoids Problem 1. Downside: Problems 2 and 3 remain, and test\nlacks power. We will discuss this approach next.\n2. Put a large amount of structure on the problem: model determinants\nof autarky prices and substitute this model in. This is hard to do,\nbut can in principal avoid Problems 1-3. Downside: tests become\njoint test of CA and structure. Much of the rest of this course can\nbe thought of as attempts to do this.\n- Recall Proposition 4:\na\n- If p is the vector of prices that prevail in an economy under autarky,\n- And t is the vector of net exports by this same economy in any\ntrading equilibrium,\na\n- Then p .t ≤ 0.\n- Comments from empirical perspective:\na\n- It is impossible to observe p\nand t at the same time (ie 'Problem 2'\ncan never be overcome).\n- This is a very weak prediction. (Compare with coin toss model.)\na\n- But remarkably, p (if you observe it) is a sufficient statistic for all of\nthe supply and demand features of the economy. (Chetty 2009 ARE\ndiscusses advantages of settings like this in which 'sufficient statistics'\nexist. Though here dimensions of statistics may be quite high...)\n\n2.1\nBernhofen and Brown (JPE, 2004)\n- Bernhofen and Brown (JPE, 2004) exploit the (nearly) closed economy\nof Japan in 1858, and its subsequent opening up to trade in 1859, as a\nnatural experiment to test for Law of CA.\na\n- Rare example of a closed economy, so p\nis (almost) observed. This\novercomes 'Problem 3'.\n- Further attractive features of this setting:\n- Relatively simple economy\n- Subsequent opening up was plausibly exogenous to economic change\nin Japan (non-autarky was forced upon Japan by USA).\n2.2\nJapan Opening Up\n2.2.1\nEmpirical Methodology\n- Suppose 1858 is autarky and 1859 is not.\n- BB (2004) effectively observe p1858 and t1859.\n- Though in practice they use years prior to 1858 for p1858 and years\npost-1859 for t1859, to allow for adjustment.\nGr\nap\nh\nof\nJ\na\npane\nse i\nmpor\nts a\nnd e\nxpor\nts, in\nmillion\nsilver Yen, from 186\n0-1865.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n- They compute p1858.t1859 and check whether it's negative.\n- Before seeing the answer, what might we be worried about if this is meant\nto be a test of the Law of Comparative Advantage?\n2.2.2\nAssumptions Required by BB (2004) Approach\n1. Perfect competition under autarky\n2. Japan price taker on international markets ⇒ there still is perfect compe\ntition in 1859\n3. No export subsidies ⇒ no pattern of trade reversals\n4. To overcome 'Problem 2': Observed autarky prices under autarky (ie\np1858) are same as what post-1858 Japan's autarky prices would have\nbeen if it were in autarky. (That is, the theory really calls for us to com\na\na\npute p1859.t1859, where p\nis the counterfactual price of Japan's 1859\neconomy if it were in autarky.)\n- (Put another way: Japan's underlying technology and tastes haven't\nchanged around 1858.)\na,1859)\n- BB (2004) point out that if the unobserved 1859 autarky price (p\nis equal to p\nplus an error term (ε) then the only real worry is\nthat t1859.ε > 0.\ncomparative advantage\nFig. 4.--Net exports and price changes for 1869.

(1858 was autarky!)\n- Under the assumption that t1858 = t1859, the DDN CA statistic puts an\na\nupper-bound on GT. Not super surprising: p1858.t1858 ≤ 0 because of GT\nin Proposition 4...\n\n3.1.2\nResults\n3.1.3\nInterpretation\n- \"Small\" (upper-bound) effects in BB (2005) surprising to some\n- What potential gains/losses from trade are not being counted in BB (2005)\ncalculation?\n- A partial list often mentioned in the literature:\n- Selection of more productive domestic firms\n- New goods available (for consumption and production)\n- Pro-competitive effects of openness to trade.\n- 'Dynamic effects' of openness to trade (typically defined as some\nthing, like innovation or learning, that moves the PPF).\n- Institutional change driven by openness to trade.\n- Some more pedestrian answers:\n- A few percentage points of GDP is nothing to spit at (small relative\nto what?)\n- GT depend on how much you trade (and Japan may trade much\nmore in the future than in 1859)\n3.2\nFrankel and Romer (1999)\n- Extremely influential paper (one of AER's most highly cited articles in\nrecent decades).\n- FR (1999) takes a huge question ('Does trade cause growth?') and answers\nit with more attention to the endogenous nature of trade than previous\nwork.\nData table s\nh\nowing per capita gains from\nd\ni\nfferent types of goods.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n- Key idea: FR instrument for a country's trade (really, its 'openness')\nby using a measure of distance: how far that country is from large\n(ie rich) potential trade partners.\n3.2.1\nFR (1999): First-Stage (Part I)\n- First-stage regression has two parts.\n- First is based on well-known gravity equation.\n- We will have much to say about these in a few weeks.\n- Key idea: bilateral trade flows fall with bilateral trade costs (and\nvariables like bilateral distance, and whether two countries share a\nborder, appear to be correlated with trade costs).\n- Gravity equation estimated is the following (NB: this isn't really conven\ntional by modern standards):\nXij + Mij\nln(\n) = a0 + a1 ln Dij + a2Ni + a3Nj + a4Bij + eij\nGDPi\n- Where (Xij + Mij ) is exports plus imports between country i and j, Dij\nis distance, N is population and Bij is a shared border dummy.

Possible explanations:\n- The IV results are still biased upwards. (A small amount of endo\ngeneity in an IV gets exaggerated by the IV method.) Countries\nthat are close to big countries are rich not just because of trade, but\nbecause of spatially correlated true determinants of prosperity (eg,\nData table\nshowing\ncomponents\nof income.\nDat\na t\nabl\ne s\nhowing rel\nation of\ntrade and\nincome for di\nfferent\nsamples of\ncountries.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n- 'Openness' is proxying for lots of true treatment effects of proximity\nto neighbors: multinational firms, technology transfer, knowledge\nspillovers, migration, political spillovers. Not just 'Trade'.\n- The dynamic effects of 'openness' accumulated over a long period of\ntime, are larger than the static one-off effects of opening up to trade.\n- Effects are many orders of magnitude higher than BB 2005 results. But\nnot clear how to compare them:\n- BB focus on consumption/welfare. FR focus on production.\n- We would expect measured GDP to fall in Japan between 1858 and\n1859 (Why?)\n- It's very surprising that the IV coefficients are larger than the OLS coef\nficients. Possible explanations:\n- Weak instrument. (But the F-stat on the first stage is reasonably\nhigh.)\n- OLS is not biased after all.\n- Sampling variation: OLS and IV coefficients not statistically distin\nguishable from one another.\n- Measurement error. (\"Trade is an [imperfect] proxy for the many\nways in which interactions between countries raise income--specialization,\nspread of ideas, and so on.\")\n- Heterogeneous treatment effects--IV only gets at the LATE, which\nmight be high.\n3.4\nFollow-on Work from FR (1999)\n- Because of importance of question, and surprising findings, FR (1999)\ngenerated a lot of controversy and follow-on work.\n- Rodrik and Rodriguez (2000) were most critical.\n- Fundamental message (that has now also been confirmed for many cross-\ncountry studies, in all fields) is that these regressions are not that robust.\n- Inclusion of various controls can change the results a great deal.\n- Different measures of 'openness' yield quite different results.\n- RR (2000) also critical of the identification assumption behind FR (1999)'s\nIV.\n\n- Lots of work used micro-data and trade liberalization episodes to go be\nyond the cross-country comparisons in FR (1999):\n- Do individual firms (or industries) become more productive when\nthey open to trade?\n- Hallak, Levinsohn and Dumas (2004) argue the case for micro-studies.\n- Eg: Trefler (2004), Pavcnik (2002), Tybout (various years).\n- We will review this literature later in the course.\n- But note that we're drifting away from theoretical arguments estab\nlishing GT in a neoclassical world\n- In two recent papers, James Feyrer has revamped interest in the cross-\ncountry approach by using panel data and an IV based on a time-varying\ncomponent of 'distance'.\n- Feyrer (2009) Paper 1: \"Trade and Income--Exploiting Time Series\nin Geography\"\n- Feyrer (2009) Paper 2: \"Distance, Trade, and Income--The 1967 to\n1975 Closing of the Suez Canal as a Natural Experiment\"\n3.4.1\nFeyrer (2009) Paper 1\n- Uses panel of country-level GDP and trade data from 1960-1995\n- Exploits fact that marginal cost of shipping via air fell faster over this\nperiod than marginal cost of shipping via sea.\n- This will make trade costs (or 'distance') fall over time. And importantly,\ntrade costs between country pairs will be affected very differently by this:\n- Germany-Japan sea distance is 12,000 miles, but only 5,000 air miles.\n('Treatment')\n- Germany-USA sea and air distances are basically the same. ('Con\ntrol')\n- Feyrer uses this variation to get a time-varying instrument for trade open\nness, and then pursues a FR 1999 approach.\n\nFigure 1: Air Freight Share of US Trade Value (excluding North America)\nAir Freight Share of Trade Value\nyear\nImports\nExports\nFigure 3: The Change in Elasticity of Trade with Respect to Sea and Air Distance\nover Time\n-1.5\n-1.0\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\nSea\nAir\nsource: Coefficients from regression table 9 column 2.\nEach point represents the coefficient on (sea or air) distance over a 5 year interval.

If two countries have the same autarky prices, then after\nopening up to trade, the autarky prices remain equilibrium prices. So\nthere will be no trade....\nThe law of comparative advantage (in words):\nCountries tend to export goods in which they have a CA, i.e. lower\nrelative autarky prices compared to other countries\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n3 / 44\n\nLaw of Comparative Advantage\nDixit-Norman-Deardorff (1980)\nLet tn ≡\nn\n\nnh\nn\ny -\nc\n, , y\n- cnh\nG\nG\n\ndenote net exports in country n\n\nu\nn\nLet\nan and u\ndenote the utility level of the representative household\nin country n under autarky and free trade\nLet pan denote the vector of autarky prices in country n\nWithout loss of generality, normalize prices such that:\n\nan\npg =\n\npg = 1,\nNotations:\ncov (x, y)\ncor (x, y)\n=\n\nvar (x) var (y)\nn\n_\n\ncov (x, y)\n=\n(xi - x) (yi - y)\ni=1\n1 n\nx =\nxi\nn\ni=1\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n4 / 44\n\nLaw of Comparative Advantage\nDixit-Norman-Deardorff (1980)\nRecall from Lecture 1:\nProposition 4 In a neoclassical trade model, if there is a\nrepresentative household in country n, then cor (p - pa, tn) ≥ 0\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n5 / 44\n\nPlan of Today's Lecture\n1 Law of comparative advantage (recap)\n2 Does the law of comparative advantage hold in the data?\n3 A primer on the size of the gains from trade\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n6 / 44\n\nTesting for Comparative Advantage\nPrinciple of CA is a fundamental theoretical idea in Economics, yet\ntesting it is hard. Why?\nProblem 1: 'Principle' version is too weak to test in real world (where\nmore then 2 countries or goods).\nProblem 2: Latent variable problem: 'Law' version is statement about\ntrading behavior but is based on autarky prices!\nProblem 3: Periods of autarky rarely observed.\nHow to proceed? Two routes:\n1 Put a small amount of structure on the problem, as in Proposition 4.\nAvoids Problem 1. Downside: Problems 2 and 3 remain, and test lacks\npower. We will discuss this approach next.\n2 Put a large amount of structure on the problem: model determinants\nof autarky prices and substitute this model in. This is hard to do, but\ncan in principal avoid Problems 1-3. Downside: tests become joint test\nof CA and structure. Much of the rest of this course can be thought of\nas attempts to do this.\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n7 / 44\n\nTesting the Law of Comparative Advantage\nRecall Proposition 4:\na\nIf p is the vector of prices that prevail in an economy under autarky,\nAnd t is the vector of net exports by this same economy in any trading\nequilibrium,\na\nThen p .t ≤ 0.\nComments from empirical perspective:\na\nIt is impossible to observe p and t at the same time (ie 'Problem 2'\ncan never be overcome).\nThis is a very weak prediction. (Compare with coin toss model.)\na\nBut remarkably, p (if you observe it) is a sufficient statistic for all of\nthe supply and demand features of the economy. (Chetty 2009 ARE\ndiscusses advantages of settings like this in which 'sufficient statistics'\nexist. Though here dimensions of statistics may be quite high...)\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n8 / 44\n\nBernhofen and Brown (JPE, 2004)\nBernhofen and Brown (JPE, 2004) exploit the (nearly) closed\neconomy of Japan in 1858, and its subsequent opening up to trade in\n1859, as a natural experiment to test for Law of CA.\na\nRare example of a closed economy, so p is (almost) observed. This\novercomes 'Problem 3'.\nFurther attractive features of this setting:\nRelatively simple economy\nSubsequent opening up was plausibly exogenous to economic change in\nJapan (non-autarky was forced upon Japan by USA).\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n9 / 44\n\nJapan Opening Up\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n10 / 44\nJapan Opening Up\nGr\nap\nh\nof\nJ\na\npane\nse i\nmpor\nts a\nnd e\nxpor\nts, in\nmillion\nsilver Yen, from 186\n0-1865.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nEmpirical Methodology\nSuppose 1858 is autarky and 1859 is not.\nBB (2004) effectively observe p1858 and t1859.\nThough in practice they use years prior to 1858 for p1858 and years\npost-1859 for t1859, to allow for adjustment.\nThey compute p1858.t1859 and check whether it's negative.\nBefore seeing the answer, what might we be worried about if this is\nmeant to be a test of the Law of Comparative Advantage?\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n11 / 44\n\nAssumptions Required by BB (2004) Approach\nSee discussion in Section III\nPerfect competition under autarky\nJapan price taker on international markets ⇒ there still is perfect\ncompetition in 1859\nNo export subsidies ⇒ no pattern of trade reversals\nTo overcome 'Problem 2': Observed autarky prices under autarky (ie\np1858) are same as what post-1858 Japan's autarky prices would have\nbeen if it were in autarky. (That is, the theory really calls for us to\na\na\ncompute p1859.t1859, where p1859 is the counterfactual price of\nJapan's 1859 economy if it were in autarky.)\n(Put another way: Japan's underlying technology and tastes haven't\nchanged around 1858.)\nBB (2004) point out that if the unobserved 1859 autarky price\n(pa,1859) is equal to p1858 plus an error term (ε) then the only real\nworry is that t1859.ε > 0.\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n12 / 44\n\n=\nrose substantially, so that the graph expresses price changes adjusted\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n13 / 44\nResults: Graphical\nNB: y-axis is p -pa, not pa (but recall that p.t = 0 by balanced trade).\nGrap\nhical r\neprese\nntation of\nthe\ncha\nnge\nin price and\nexp\nort\nquantity\nfor var\nious\ngoods.\n\nResults\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n14 / 44\nResults\nData table\nof export components by\nyear of export, in millions\nRyo.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nComments\nTheory says nothing about which goods are 'up' and which are 'down'\nin Figure 3, only that the scatter plot should be upward-sloping.\nLow power test.

(1858 was autarky!)\nUnder the assumption that t1858 = t1859, the DDN CA statistic puts\na\nan upper-bound on GT. Not super surprising: p1858.t1858 ≤ 0 because\nof GT in Proposition 4...\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n19 / 44\n\nResults\nThese translate into 5.4-9.1 % of GDP\nData table showi ng per capita gains from dif\ns\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n20 / 44\nData table s\nh\nowing per capita gains from\nd\ni\nfferent types of goods.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nInterpretation I\n\"Small\" (upper-bound) effects in BB (2005) surprising to some\nWhat potential gains/losses from trade are not being counted in BB\n(2005) calculation?\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n21 / 44\n\nInterpretation I\n\"Small\" (upper-bound) effects in BB (2005) surprising to some\nWhat potential gains/losses from trade are not being counted in BB\n(2005) calculation?\nA partial list often mentioned in the literature:\nSelection of more productive domestic firms\nNew goods available (for consumption and production)\nPro-competitive effects of openness to trade.\n'Dynamic effects' of openness to trade (typically defined as something,\nlike innovation or learning, that moves the PPF).\nInstitutional change driven by openness to trade.\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n21 / 44\n\nInterpretation I\n\"Small\" (upper-bound) effects in BB (2005) surprising to some\nWhat potential gains/losses from trade are not being counted in BB\n(2005) calculation?\nA partial list often mentioned in the literature:\nSelection of more productive domestic firms\nNew goods available (for consumption and production)\nPro-competitive effects of openness to trade.\n'Dynamic effects' of openness to trade (typically defined as something,\nlike innovation or learning, that moves the PPF).\nInstitutional change driven by openness to trade.\nSome more pedestrian answers:\nA few percentage points of GDP is nothing to spit at (small relative to\nwhat?)\nGT depend on how much you trade (and Japan may trade much more\nin the future than in 1859)\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n21 / 44\n\nFrankel and Romer (1999)\nExtremely influential paper (one of AER's most highly cited articles in\nrecent decades).\nFR (1999) takes a huge question ('Does trade cause growth?') and\nanswers it with more attention to the endogenous nature of trade\nthan previous work.\nKey idea: FR instrument for a country's trade (really, its 'openness') by\nusing a measure of distance: how far that country is from large (ie\nrich) potential trade partners.\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n22 / 44\n\nFR (1999): First-Stage (Part I)\nFirst-stage regression has two parts.\nFirst is based on well-known gravity equation.\nWe will have much to say about these in a few weeks.\nKey idea: bilateral trade flows fall with bilateral trade costs (and\nvariables like bilateral distance, and whether two countries share a\nborder, appear to be correlated with trade costs).\nGravity equation estimated is the following (NB: this isn't really\nconventional by modern standards):\nXij + Mij\nln(\n) = a0 + a1 ln Dij + a2Ni + a3Nj + a4Bij + eij\nGDPi\nWhere (Xij + Mij ) is exports plus imports between country i and j,\nDij is distance, N is population and Bij is a shared border dummy.

Possible\nexplanations:\nThe IV results are still biased upwards. (A small amount of endogeneity\nin an IV gets exaggerated by the IV method.) Countries that are close\nto big countries are rich not just because of trade, but because of\nspatially correlated true determinants of prosperity (eg, 'institutions').\n'Openness' is proxying for lots of true treatment effects of proximity to\nneighbors: multinational firms, technology transfer, knowledge\nspillovers, migration, political spillovers. Not just 'Trade'.\nThe dynamic effects of 'openness' accumulated over a long period of\ntime, are larger than the static one-off effects of opening up to trade.\nEffects are many orders of magnitude higher than BB 2005 results.\nBut not clear how to compare them:\nBB focus on consumption/welfare. FR focus on production.\nWe would expect measured GDP to fall in Japan between 1858 and\n1859 (Why?)\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n30 / 44\n\nComments II\nIt's very surprising that the IV coefficients are larger than the OLS\ncoefficients. Possible explanations:\nWeak instrument. (But the F-stat on the first stage is reasonably\nhigh.)\nOLS is not biased after all.\nSampling variation: OLS and IV coefficients not statistically\ndistinguishable from one another.\nMeasurement error. (\"Trade is an [imperfect] proxy for the many ways\nin which interactions between countries raise income--specialization,\nspread of ideas, and so on.\")\nHeterogeneous treatment effects--IV only gets at the LATE, which\nmight be high.\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n31 / 44\n\nFollow-on Work from FR (1999), part I\nBecause of importance of question, and surprising findings, FR (1999)\ngenerated a lot of controversy and follow-on work.\nRodrik and Rodriguez (2000) were most critical.\nFundamental message (that has now also been confirmed for many\ncross-country studies, in all fields) is that these regressions are not\nthat robust.\nInclusion of various controls can change the results a great deal.\nDifferent measures of 'openness' yield quite different results.\nRR (2000) also critical of the identification assumption behind FR\n(1999)'s IV.\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n32 / 44\n\nFollow-on Work from FR (1999), part II\nLots of work used micro-data and trade liberalization episodes to go\nbeyond the cross-country comparisons in FR (1999):\nDo individual firms (or industries) become more productive when they\nopen to trade?\nHallak, Levinsohn and Dumas (2004) argue the case for micro-studies.\nEg: Trefler (2004), Pavcnik (2002), Tybout (various years).\nWe will review this literature later in the course.\nBut note that we're drifting away from theoretical arguments\nestablishing GT in a neoclassical world\nIn two recent papers, James Feyrer has revamped interest in the\ncross-country approach by using panel data and an IV based on a\ntime-varying component of 'distance'.\nFeyrer (2009) Paper 1: \"Trade and Income--Exploiting Time Series in\nGeography\"\nFeyrer (2009) Paper 2: \"Distance, Trade, and Income--The 1967 to\n1975 Closing of the Suez Canal as a Natural Experiment\"\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n33 / 44\n\nFeyrer (2009) Paper 1\nUses panel of country-level GDP and trade data from 1960-1995\nExploits fact that marginal cost of shipping via air fell faster over this\nperiod than marginal cost of shipping via sea.\nThis will make trade costs (or 'distance') fall over time. And\nimportantly, trade costs between country pairs will be affected very\ndifferently by this:\nGermany-Japan sea distance is 12,000 miles, but only 5,000 air miles.\n('Treatment')\nGermany-USA sea and air distances are basically the same. ('Control')\nFeyrer uses this variation to get a time-varying instrument for trade\nopenness, and then pursues a FR 1999 approach.\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n34 / 44\n\nUS Trade by Mode of Transport\nConsistent with a change in relative cost of using each mode\nFigure 1: Air Freight Share of US Trade Value (excluding North America)\nAir Freight Share of Trade Value\nyear\nImports\nExports\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n35 / 44\nsource: Hummels (2007), pp 133.\nCourtesy of James Feyrer.

There are aspects of welfare (e.g. change\nin the number of varieties available) that are not captured in the\nstudies we've seen above, but which might be important (or not!).\nAlso very hard to get exogenous change in ability to trade.\n14.581 (Week 2)\nGT and CA in the data\nSpring 2013\n43 / 44\n\nAreas for future research\nAre there other ways (or places) in which to test CA?\nCan we find more natural experiments that affect regions' abilities to\ntrade, to shed more light on the size of GT?\nMore work is needed on quantifying empirically (ideally as\nnon-parametrically as possible) the different mechanisms behind GT\nAre there ways to formalize the connection (or lack thereof) between\nreduced-form estimates of GT (that we saw today) and GT predicted\nby commonly-used models of trade (that we will see later)?\nHow well do the measures that statistical agencies use to measure\neconomic welfare correspond with the concepts of welfare in the\nmodels we have seen?
