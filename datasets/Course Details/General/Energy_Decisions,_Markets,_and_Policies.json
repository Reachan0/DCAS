  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nRecitations: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nDescription\n\nA required subject for the energy studies minor, this class introduces students to basic concepts and methods of analysis used across the social sciences to understand how the production, distribution and consumption of energy are determined and experienced. The readings and discussion materials illustrate and analyze both the choices and constraints regarding sources and uses of energy, introducing students to diverse frameworks, theories, and conceptual tools (e.g. economic, organizational and managerial, political, social, and cultural) for describing and explaining behavior at various levels of aggregation (e.g. individuals, households, firms, social movements, and governments). As a survey of social science perspectives and analytic tools, the course is not intended to prepare you to be an expert in any particular area, but rather to prepare you to use the tools of the social sciences to understand and shape real energy decisions, markets, and policies.\n\nThe central insights of the course will include the importance of recognizing and taking account interdependencies among actors and systems; the need to make explicit what are often tacit assumptions and taken-for-granted habits of thought, behavior and practice; the unanticipated consequences of purposive social action; the heterogeneity in human conditions, cultures and societies; and the iterative reflexivity (volatile feedback loops) characteristic of contemporary social action.\n\nWe will show that what sometimes seem to be purely technical issues often have massive human, individual and collective/social components that must be dealt with to direct changes. There is no one solution to the energy problem, which is a, if not the, central piece of our environmental conundrum. Too often, however, we do not pay sufficient attention to the organizational, economic, distributional and cultural components of problems that have important technical dimensions.\n\nThe course will include examples of cost-benefit, organizational, and institutional analyses of energy production, transformation, and use as well as public policy choices affecting distribution and consumption. More specific topics include the role of markets and prices, financial analysis of new energy-related technologies; institutional path dependence; economic and political determinants of government regulation; the impact of regulation on decisions and feedback into the political/regulatory/energy system. Examples will be drawn from various countries and settings.\n\nThis course is one of many\nOCW Energy Courses\n, and it is a core subject in MIT's undergraduate\nEnergy Studies Minor\n. This Institute-wide program complements the deep expertise obtained in any major with a broad understanding of the interlinked realms of science, technology, and social sciences as they relate to energy and associated environmental challenges.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n14.01 Principles of Microeconomics\nis a prerequisite for taking this course.\n\nAssignments\n\nThere will be an individual paper addressing the negotiations from the Climate Game (a role-playing exercise that is run through\nC-Learn Climate Simulation\n), and a final team paper that is to be worked on throughout the length of the course. The deliverables for the paper include a detailed outline, the paper itself, and an in-class oral presentation of the paper.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nIndividual paper\n\n10%\n\nTwo quizzes\n\n40%\n\nTeam project\n\n40%\n\nClass participation\n\n10%\n\nResources\n\nWhen approaching the reading assignments, it is recommended that you take notes when reading to help you learn the material and develop your own communication skills.

Why or why not?\n\nIt is 1975, Gerald Ford is the Post-\nWatergate President\n- What has happened to oil prices lately?\n- President Ford is considering supporting\neither a motor fuels tax or regulation of\naverage new car and light truck mileage - the\nCAFE program\n-\nWould you have advised him to support the tax,\nthe CAFE program, or neither - and why?\n-\nHow else might the US have reduced its use of\npetroleum?\n\nIt is late 1980, and President Carter\nis packing his bags\n- What has happened to oil prices since 1975?\n- Some of Carter's advisors are advocating\nbuilding a synthetic fuels industry that could\nturn enough US coal into motor fuel to\neliminate the need to import oil.\n-\nWhat would you like to know to decide whether\nsuch an effort would be in the public interest?\n-\nBased on what you do know (and what Carter\nmight have known in 1980), would you advise him\nto support this effort and establish the Synthetic\nFuels Corporation?\n\nIt is 1986; Ronald Reagan is President\n- What has happened to oil prices since 1980?\n- How well has the Synthetic Fuels Corporation\n(SFC) performed?\n- Would you advise President Reagan to\nabolish the SFC? Why or why not?\n- What facts would you like to have had in order\nto be confident in your advice?\n- Suppose the SFC had built enough capacity to\nbe able to eliminate the need for oil imports,\nbut at twice the cost of conventional motor\nfuels. What would you have advised then?\n\nIt is February 2012, and Barack Obama\nis President\n- What has happened to US dependence on\nimported oil since 1986? Overall? Recently?\n- What happened to CAFE standards from the\nmid-1980s until the late 2000s?

Bush formally rejected the Protocol in 2001\n-\nSubsequent COPs have failed to produce a global\nagreement on emissions, and the US has been not likely to\npass emissions-limiting legislation any time soon\n-\nYour COP, beginning 2/29, may be the last chance, since\nthere is growing evidence that damages from climate\nchange may be severe & contain nasty surprises...\n\nBack to 2012 & President Obama\n- Would you advise the President to favor or\ndisfavor electricity generation from coal?\nWhat are the issues?\n- What about production of synthetic motor\nfuels from coal?

Some government don't\nhave noble goals, but they all have goals.\n\nElements of functional governments\n- A (near-) monopoly on the use of force within some\nterritory - lack marks failed states. (Syria...?)\n- Functional legitimacy - people are generally willing to\naccept policies/decisions without the use of force\n\nPerhaps because they come from a process perceived to be\nfair or divinely endorsed, or because they serve popular goals\n\nOr to some extent because order & stability are always\nvaluable and the costs of disobedience or attempted\nrevolution are perceived to exceed the likely benefits\n- Functioning states generally have both a set of\npolicies (law, regulations, unwritten rules) and a\nprocess (open or secret) for changing them\n\nThe market v. the political world\n-\nIndividuals pursue self-interest v. groups also pursue self-interest\nand (different views of) the public interest; most decisions affect\nthe whole community - collective choice, public goods...\n\nPreferences v. Ideologies: different views of how society should work & ideal\narrangements to make it do so - reflects both values and beliefs\n\nHoward Roark's speech: very strong (Libertarian, Ayn Rand) ideology\n\nHughes reading: London's awful pre WWI electric system (65 utilities, 10\nfrequencies, 24 voltages) reflected strong ideology favoring local control\n-\nWithout a dictator, no guarantee of collective consistency\n\nE.g., Condorcet (1785) paradox of voting: 3 voters, 3 alternatives,\npreferences A>B>C, C>A>B, B>C>A; voting A>B, B>C, C>A...\n-\nCompetition v. competition & influence, cooperation, and loyalty\n-\nGoals: wealth v. wealth & power (the ability to get others to act\nagainst their self-interest, for your interest or your view of the\npublic interest) - depends on influence, cooperation, loyalty, and,\nsometimes, force\n\nCarter v. Carter Coal\n-\nBeginning in early 1935, the Supreme Court struck down\nseveral New Deal laws as unconstitutional\n-\nThe Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935, at issue in\nCarter v. Carter Coal, was an attempt to raise coal prices &\nwages while satisfying the criteria for constitutionality laid\ndown in an earlier such decision\n-\nJames Carter, President of Carter Coal, sued his board\nwhen they voted to pay the tax the Act imposed\n-\nWhile the opinions in this case are written as technical\nexercises in legal analysis, they reflect fundamental\ndifferences in ideology\n\nThe Debate (1935 and 2012)\n-\nWhat's the two provisions were at issue here?\n-\nWhat reasons did Sutherland give for finding both\nunconstitutional?\n-\nWhat does Sutherland's opinion imply about the proper role of\nthe federal government?\n-\nTeam A, why was Sutherland right about this case and about the\nproper role of the federal government?\n-\nWhat reasons did Hughes give for dissenting?\n-\nWhat reasons did Cardozo give for dissenting?\n-\nWhat does Cardozo's opinion imply about the proper role of the\nfederal government?\n-\nTeam B, why was Cardozo right?\n- The floor is open for rebuttals...\n\nLater Developments\n- On February 5, 1937, Roosevelt introduced the \"court-\npacking\" bill, which would have let him appoint\nadditional Justices\n- On March 29, 1937, the Court published a 5-4 opinion\nupholding a minimum wage law\n\nOne Justice, Roberts, had changed his view of such laws\n\nCalled \"the switch in time that saved nine\", but the Court's vote had\nbeen taken in late 1936\n\nThe \"court-packing\" bill died in the Senate in July, 1937\n- Which broad view of the role proper of the federal\ngovernment has generally prevailed since?\n- Is this big issue settled permanently?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.031J / 14.43J / 21A.341J / 11.161J Energy Decisions, Markets, and Policies\nSpring 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Time-Scales\n- Emissions of CO2 have a half-life (not from exponential\ndecay, but...) of around a century\n- The earth is not in equilibrium with respect to current\nGHG concentrations; it takes lots of heat to warm the\ndeep oceans, lots of time to diffuse\n- Thus even if GHG emissions were cut sharply,\nconcentrations would remain high & climate change\nwould continue, with a variety of known and unknown\ndamages, for decades\n- Decisions thus involve time-scales of centuries: the\nCzar must decide how much to spend today to produce\nbenefits far into the future and for people not yet born\n\nValue Today of Preventing This Florida in 2112?\nCourtesy of ACIA and Clifford Grabhorn.

Uncertainty\n-\nMeaning of \"uncertain\" in technical v. popular discourse...\n-\nEmissions GHGs depend on population, per-capital GDP, mix of economic\nactivity, future policies, and present and future technologies - all of which\nare uncertain.\n-\nMuch is uncertain about the climate system - e.g., warming of the deep\nocean, possible irreversibilities & tipping points - so global climate impacts\nof any given GHG emissions trajectory are uncertain\n-\nClimate models disagree on regional effects (e.g., warming, rainfall)\nproduced by given global changes, thus impacts very uncertain\n-\nRegional impacts will likely take us into new ground & produce surprises\n(esp. in ecology), so damages are very, very uncertain!\n-\nLittle experience, historically, in successful adaptation to climate change\n(e.g., Mayans), so ability/cost of adaptation uncertain\n-\nCosts of reducing damages via emissions reductions are also uncertain -\ndepend on population, technology, etc.\n-\nCAN'T CREDIBLY COMPARE COSTS & BENEFITS OF POLICIES\n\nThe Czar Needs to do Adaptive Risk Management\n\n-\nSlow down to reduce the likelihood of a collision - reduce GHG emissions\n-\nLifeboat drills in case of a collision - invest in adapting to climate change\n-\nStation lookouts - study the evolving climate system, improve forecasts\n-\nDevelop maneuvering options - new technologies, geoengineering\n-\nEnsure lookouts are heard - build responsive decision processes\n-\nProbabilities unknown; judgment & risk-tolerance must drive decisions\nCourtesy of Prof. Henrik Schmidt.

Poor Countries\n- Picking a goal - e.g. to decide to stabilize CO2 at 550\nppm by 2050 - roughly fixes global emissions\n\"budget\" until then because of CO2's long lifetime\n- Want to make cheap reductions ASAP to avoid the\nneed for draconian cuts later to meet the \"budget\"\n- Want to raise intensity over time as new technologies\ncome on line, existing capital stock wears out\n- Czar's modelers: to minimize global costs,\ndeveloping nations must make significant cuts\nversus \"business as usual\"\n\nWhy Must the Poor Cut? They Will Drive Growth!\nCourtesy of BP Energy Outlook 2030, January 2012. Used with permission.\n\nWhy Must the Poor Cut? To Reduce Global Costs\n-\nPrinciple (between and within countries): To minimize total cost,\nwant to equate marginal cost across countries (or whatever)\n\nSuppose national costs of reduction are Ci(ri), I = 1, ..., N.\n\nCzar: min Ci subject to ri = R. Necessary: MCi = , all i.\n-\nA competitive market p = mc for all producers; yields efficient production\n-\nSame principle applies to a firm producing from multiple plants\n-\nHow to do it? Two approaches (more later):\n-\nPut a price on emissions; all reduce until p = mc\n-\nCap & trade: price of allowances serves the same function (Parsons et al)\n-\nWhy are poor countries' costs of abatement relatively low?\n-\nThey are building more new facilities, buildings, etc.; it is generally cheaper\nto make new facilities, etc. efficient than to retrofit old facilities\n-\nMuch energy use in poor countries is now dirty and inefficient, so the net\ncost of making it clean (which has benefits) and efficient is relatively low\n\nBUT - IS IT FAIR? Emissions per capita:\nMetric tons CO2 from fossil fuels per capita, 2009.\nSource: International Energy Agency\n\nBut what is fair? Emissions per $GDP:\n\nKg of CO2 from fossil fuels per $US of GDP, 2009. Source:\nInternational Energy Agency\n\nBUT - IS IT FAIR? Who made the problem?\nCumulative CO2 emissions from fossil fuels - rich countries' contribution is blue\n\nPoor Countries have prevailed, so far\n-\nSince 1992, there have been 17 conferences of the parties to the\nUNFCC (COPs), most recently in Durban, South Africa\n-\nCOP 3 in 1997 produced the Kyoto Protocol, calling for Annex I\nnations (mainly rich) only(!) to make reductions in 2008-12; others\nresisted even promises to promise one day...\n-\nThe EU & others ratified; the US did not, and President George W.\nBush formally rejected the Protocol in 2001\n-\nThe EU established a CO2 emissions trading system (EU ETS), may make its goal;\nothers likely will not do so\n-\nSubsequent COPs have failed to produce a global agreement on\nemissions, & the US won't pass emissions-limiting legislation any\ntime soon\n\nBut, sadly(?), there is no Czar\n\nIt's All Up to Your COP,\nWednesday & Friday!\n\nThe Czar could solve the fairness problem & maintain\nefficiency by taxing the rich and using the proceeds to\npay for the poor's emissions reductions...\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.031J / 14.43J / 21A.341J / 11.161J Energy Decisions, Markets, and Policies\nSpring 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Working Group I Contribution to the Fourth Assessment Report of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, FAQ 2.1, Figure 2. Cambridge University Press. This figure is in the public domain.\n\nToday's Topics\n- Energy demand as a derived demand\n- Short-run v. long-run demand functions\n- Estimating demand functions: problems & results\n- Demand function instability\n- Two puzzles: the McKinsey curve and the Prius\n\nDerived Demand\n- Gasoline is nasty - why do you buy it?\n- The demand for energy (gasoline) is derived from the\ndemand for energy services (transportation), e.g.\n\nFood preparation, heating, lighting, cooling, loud music...\n- The technology of producing any particular energy\nservice can be summarized in a production function:\n\nQ = F(K, L, E, M)\n\nCapital is important in the production of most energy services\n\nSome studies find that capital and (particularly electric)\nenergy are complements: increasing the price of one\ndecreases demand for both (coffee & cream)\n- Historically there has been enormous progress in\ntechnologies for energy services\n\nExamples: Lighting (Nordhaus), Cars\nRecent estimate: auto technology advanced 2.6%/year, 1980-2006\nIf weight, horsepower, & torque at 1980 levels, mileage 50% by 2006\nFigure 1.3 removed due to copyright restrictions. Source: Nordhaus, William D. \"Do Real-Output and Real-Wage Measures\nCapture Reality? The History of Lighting Suggests Not.\" Published in January 1996 by University of Chicago Press.\n\nShort Run Energy Demand: capital fixed\n- Begin with two fundamental functions:\n\nDemand function for some energy service:\n\nES = D(EScost, Ps, income l Ks, \"tastes\")\n\nEScost = per-unit cost of the service (e.g., lighting)\n\nKs = capital stocks & tastes are fixed in the short run\n\nProduction function for that energy service:\n\nES = F(E, Ms, Ls l Ks, technology)\n\nMs = materials of various sorts\n- Given all prices, including PE, solve for E demand by\n\nFinding least-cost inputs to produce ES: E*(ES, Ps,...),\nEScost* (ES, P's,...)\n\nThen substituting into ES demand function, get E*(Ps, ...)\n\nConsider Electricity for Lighting\n- Start with the two basic functions:\n\nDemand for lighting (lumen-hours): L = a(Lcost)-b, a and b\npositive constants, Lcost is cost per lumen-hour\n\nb = - (dL/dLcost)(Lcost/L) = price elasticity of demand for\nlighting, the limiting ratio of percentage changes\n\nIn the SR bulbs in the house are fixed, so production function\nis just L = eE, e is a positive constant, E is electricity\n-\nGiven price of electricity, PE($/kwh), solve for $/lumen,\nthen substitute in demand function (check units!)\n\nL(lumens)=e(lumens/kwh)E(kwh)\n\nLcost*($/lumen) = PE($/kwh)/e(lumen/kwh)\n\nSubstitute & solve: L = eE = a(PE/e)-b; E = a(PE)-b(e)b-1\n\nSR Demand: Some Remarks\n-\nHere the elasticity of demand for electricity to produce\nlighting equals the elasticity of demand for lighting; this is\nnot a general property of derived demand\n\nDerived demand for an input (electricity) can be more or less elastic\nthan the demand for the output (lighting) from which it is derived\n-\nNote that if b > 0, making lighting more efficient (raising e)\nwould raise the demand for lighting - by lowering the cost\n\nMaking cars more efficient makes driving cheaper, all else equal,\nand should increase driving - the \"rebound effect\" of CAFE\n-\nIf b > 1, so demand for lighting is price-elastic, making\nlighting more efficient raises the demand for electricity\n\nMight be plausible in this case...?\n\nSome have argued that CAFE standards increase the demand for\ngasoline this way, but it seems b < 1 in fact; small rebound\n\nIncome Also Affects Demand:\nPassenger Kilometers Traveled/ Capita\n1,000\n10,000\n100,000\n1,000,000\n1,000\n10,000\n100,000\n1,000,000\nGDP/cap, US$(1996)\nPKT/cap\n1,000\n10,000\n100,000\n1,000,000\nGDP/cap, US$(2000)\n1,000,000\n1,000\n10,000\n100,000\nPKT/cap\nSub-Saharan Africa\nLatin America\nMiddle East & North Africa\nOther Pacific Asia\nSouth Asia\nCentrally Planned Asia\nDeveloping Regions:\nNorth America\nPacific OECD\nWestern Europe\nEastern Europe\nFormer Soviet Union\nIndustrialized Regions:\nReforming Economies:\n\nDerived Demand: Longer Run\n- Consider my demand for gasoline\n\nIn the SR, with my car given, I can only respond to price or\nincome changes by changing driving: the output effect\n\nIn the LR, if changes persiste, I can change my car, changing\nthe relation between gasoline demand and driving: the\nsubstitution effect\n- Basic principle (Samuelson): Expect higher LR price\nor income elasticity than SR since more flexibility\ngreater ability to respond greater response\n- Most energy-transforming and energy-using capital is\nvery long-lived: houses, cars, etc.\n\nPast investment decisions shape future costs & options\n\nCost of rapid cuts in CO2: either drastically cut energy\nservices or scrap & replace existing assets prematurely\n\nDemand Estimation: Identification\n- Early demand studies for\n\nagricultural products found\n\ndemand curves sloped up\n\nHow could this happen?\n- The classic identification\n\nproblem: shifts in demand\n\ntraced out the supply curve\n- Teaching note works out a simple example with linear\nsupply & demand curves:\n\nNot possible in principle to estimate demand without data on\nsome variable that shifts the supply curve\n\nSimilarly, need demand shifters to estimate the supply curve\n\nGenerally use special techniques to get \"good\" estimates\n\nDemand Estimation: Dynamics\n-\n\"Partial adjustment\" models let SR response (to temporary Δ) &\nLR response (to permanent Δ) differ\n\nE(t) - E(t-1) = [E*(Ps,Y, tastes,...) - E(t-1)], 0 < < 1\n\nE* is a model of long-run equilibrium demand; gives demand in the limit if Ps,\nY constant for a long time\n\nPut E(t-1) on the right, find coeffs that \"best fit\" data:\n\nE(t) = E*(Ps,Y, tastes,...) + (1- )E(t-1)\n\nResponse to temporary change in Ps = reponse to permanent change\n\nCoefficient of lagged demand gives , can then get E*\n-\nOther approaches are also used\n\nE.g., Huntington (see teaching note) decomposes oil P into Pmax, [P - Pmax],\nfinds Pmax has larger effect\n-\nVery durable assets (esp. structures, cities) in energy full\nresponse to changes in price, income, ... can take a LONG time\n\nDemand Estimation: Results\n- Estimated LR price & income elasticities for energy\ngenerally much larger than SR elasticities (small )\n- SR income & price elasticities generally < 0.5 -\nlimited ability to respond with fixed capital assets\n- Gasoline & electricity are the most studied;

What about\ncommercial & industrial demand?\n- Imperfect information, riskiness of future savings\nprobably play a role, but no simple story...\n- But there is more...\n\nSome folks overinvest in efficiency!\n-\nConsider the Toyota Prius:\n\n>3 Million sold, >1 Million in the US\n\nA Corolla + 50mpg v. 28mpg\n-\nDid all those consumers make a good investment?\n\nC = cost difference, S = annual savings, r = interest, T = breakeven time:\n\nr=0, T = C/S; r>0, solve C = (S/r)(1 - e-rT) T = (-1/r)ln[1-(rC/S)] if rC < S\n\nAverage Prius cost premium C = $7,450; assume = maintenance\n\nCars average 12k miles per year; if $3/gallon, cost/year:\n\nPrius: (12000/50)x3 = $720, Corolla: (12000/28)x3 = $1,286; S = $566\n\nAt r = 0, breakeven in 7450/566 = 13.2 years\n\nAt 5.0% breakeven in 21.6 years; > 7.6% rC>S, forever is not long enough\n\nInitial subsidies, higher gas prices make Prius more attractive, but...\n-\nHard to reconcile this with high discount rates in other settings ... unless this\n(economic) model is missing something important!\n\nPhoto by IFCAR on Wikimedia Commons.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.031J / 14.43J / 21A.341J / 11.161J Energy Decisions, Markets, and Policies\nSpring 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "15.031J\n\nSpring, 2012\n\nWhy Not Use American Coal Instead of Saudi Oil?1\n\nThe US is the Saudi Arabia of coal. In fact, it's better than that: according to the U.S. Energy\nInformation Administration (EIA), Saudi Arabia has 19.9% of the world's oil reserves, while the\nUS has 28.3% of the world's coal reserves. Based on recent levels and trends in coal\nconsumption, the EIA estimates that we have enough coal for 146 years, even if no new reserves\nare added, as history suggests they surely will be. However the US energy problem has been\ndefined over the years, many observers have thought that it is obvious that American coal must\nbe part of the solution. Others have disagreed.\nThe Environmental Challenge\nIn 1970, Congress passed and President Nixon signed major amendments to the Clean Air Act of\n1963. These amendments are usually referred to as the Clean Air Act of 1970. These\namendments provided for the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),\nwhich began operation in 1971. Among other things, the 1970 Act charged the EPA with setting\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for a set of important pollutants, with\nreviewing State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for achieving those standards, and with setting\nemissions limits for new electric generating units. New coal-fired generating units were likely to\nbe the most affected by these standards.\n\nIn setting the NAAQS, EPA was instructed \"to protect the public health\" and to allow \"an\nadequate margin of safety.\" Some observers argued that this language assumed the existence of\nthreshold levels of concentration, below which pollution posed no risk whatever, rather than a\nsmooth dose-response function. They contended that the law should have required the EPA to\nbase standards on a comparison of costs and benefits, but most in Congress seemed to feel that\nthis sort of analysis was inappropriate in situations involving human health. Other observers\nargued that standard-setting was not an efficient approach to environmental policy and that the\ntaxes and/or cap-and-trade systems (which limited total pollution but let polluters trade rights to\nproduce it) could produce the same results at lower cost. Few listened to this argument,\nhowever.\nThe First Oil Shock and Project Independence\nIn 1949, net petroleum imports accounted for only about 5.5% of US consumption. Net imports\ngrew steadily thereafter, and US production of petroleum peaked in 1970. By 1972 the US\nimported about 4.5 million barrels per day, which accounted for just under 28% of US\nconsumption.2\n\n1 This case was prepared for classroom use only. Please do not reproduce, cite, or quote from it. Most data herein\nwere obtained online from either from the US Energy Information Administration or the BP Statistical Report on\nWorld Energy.\nIn the 1972-74 period, oil accounted for about 17% of primary energy used in\nelectricity generation.\n2 A barrel of crude oil is equal to 42 gallons or 159 liters. The mix of products resulting from refining a barrel of\ncrude oil will depend on characteristics of both the oil and the refinery. On average, a barrel of oil refined in the US\nin recent years yielded about 19 gallons of gasoline, about 10 gallons of diesel fuel, about 4 gallons of jet fuel, and a\nvariety of other products.\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2012\n\nIn October 1973, the Arab members of OPEC (the price-and output-setting Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries) announced a boycott of the US (and, later, the Netherlands) in\nresponse to its having supported Israel in the then-ongoing Yom Kippur war with its Arab\nneighbors. However, since oil is traded globally and tanker cargoes can be bought, sold, and\nredirected at sea with a few telephone calls, the US nonetheless obtained essentially all the oil it\ndemanded at market prices (as did the Netherlands).\n\nOPEC subsequently announced price increases and output cuts. As a consequence,\nbetween 1972 and 1974 the world experienced what is generally termed the first oil price shock:\nthe price of crude oil increased by over 460%. (See the figure at the end of this note.) In\nNovember, 1973, shortly after the end of the Yom Kippur war, President Nixon announced\n\"Project Independence,\" an effort to make the nation independent of imported energy by 1980.\n\nSome analysts argued that this was not a sensible goal. They argued that not only had the\nUS just seen that embargoes don't work in a world market, but even if they did work, an\neffective embargo against our allies would affect us even if we were energy independent. Thus,\nthey concluded, even if we used no imported oil, oil would continue to shape our foreign policy\nto some extent. Further, they contended, even though oil imports obviously involve Americans\nsending money abroad, the key to reducing the impact of oil price shocks on consumers is to\ndevelop cheaper sources of energy. Finally, they argued, we are indeed vulnerable to price\nshocks in the world oil market, but reducing that vulnerability involves reducing the use of oil,\nnot the use of imported oil. Despite these arguments, the goal of energy independence has\nremained very popular in political circles ever since the 1970s.\nCAFE Standards\n\nIn the aftermath of the first oil price shock, there was interest in reducing US use of oil in general\nby increasing efficiency in the transportation sector. Legislation signed by President Ford in\n1975 established the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, which put a lower\nlimit on the average mileage of new passenger cars sold by each auto company in the US\nbeginning in 1978. A less stringent limit was placed on the average mileage of new light-duty\ntrucks (which came to include minivans and SUVs) beginning in 1979. The initial legislation\nspecified that these limits were to be adjusted by the National Highway Transportation Safety\nAdministration (NHTSA) over time in light of technical developments and other considerations.\n\nJapan and most European nations had long been almost totally dependent on imported oil\nfor transportation fuel. They had mainly relied on high taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel in order\nto limit consumption, though they also came to adopt mileage limits. When the CAFE program\nwas proposed, some observers argued that taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel should be raised\ninstead. They argued that tax increases would affect all drivers, not just those who purchased\nnew cars. Moreover, they contended, improving automobile vehicle mileage reduces cost per\nmile driven and thus encourages driving - perhaps enough to increase fuel consumption. Other\nobservers doubted that consumers would respond much to changes in fuel prices and argued that\nforcing the auto companies to produce more efficient vehicles was much more likely to reduce\noil consumption.\n\nMileage standards for cars were increased through 1985 and for light duty trucks through\n1984. A 2002 report of the National Research Council concluded that \"for the entire light duty\nfleet ... between 1975 and 1984 technology improvements were concentrated on fuel economy:\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2012\n\nit improved by 62% without any loss of performance as measured by 0-60 mph acceleration\ntimes.\"3\nThe Second Oil Shock\nThe 1985 car standard was still in effect in 2009, while the light-duty truck standard\nhad been increased by only 1 mile per gallon between 1984 and 2005. The National Research\nCouncil report concluded that after 1985, technology improvements were concentrated on\nperformance and other vehicle attributes: between 1985 and 2000, vehicles became 20% heavier,\nand 0-60 times fell by 25%.\nOil prices remained high by historic standards during the 1974-78 period until the 1979 Islamic\nRevolution in Iran again disrupted supply, and the world experienced the second oil price shock:\nlargely as a consequence of events in Iran, between 1978 and 1980 crude oil prices increased by\nanother 260%. Despite these price increases and despite Project Independence, US net imports\nrose by over 220% between 1972 and 1980, reaching almost five million barrels a day.\n\nIn 1980, about 41% of oil and other petroleum products (by energy content) that was\nconsumed in the US was imported. About 8.5% was used to generate electricity, accounting for\n14% of primary energy used in electricity generation. Fifty-one percent of oil was used in\ntransportation, where it accounted for 97% of energy input.4\nSynthetic Fuels\n\nIn December, 1980, after the election he had lost to Ronald Reagan but before Reagan's\ninauguration, President Jimmy Carter signed legislation establishing the US Synthetic Fuels\nCorporation. The Corporation was authorized to spend up to $88 billion to provide subsidies to\nthe private sector for commercial-scale plants that would use coal and other \"unconventional\"\nresources (like tar sands and oil shale) to produce alternatives to imported oil and natural gas.\n\nThe idea of using coal as a feedstock to produce an oil substitute was hardly new.\nGermany has an abundance of coal but essentially no oil, and German scientists worked to\ndevelop fundamental coal-to-liquids (CTL) technologies in the 1910s and 1920s. From 1928\nthrough 1952, the US Bureau of Mines experimented with a variety of these technologies and\nbuilt two pilot plants that produced synthetic fuel. Germany and Japan made intensive use of the\nFischer-Tropsch process, first developed in Germany in the 1920s, to produce synthetic diesel\nfuel during World War II. South Africa, which also has considerable coal reserves, also used the\nFischer-Tropsch process to produce synthetic fuel at scale, beginning in the early 1980s when\nhardening opposition to apartheid made it more difficult for them to import oil. (These plants are\nstill operating.)\n\nAccording to the EIA, a CTL plant costs about 4 times as much to build as an oil refinery\nwith the same capacity. Whether synthetic fuel is competitive with petroleum-derived fuel\ndepends critically on the relative prices of coal and oil. (One 2009 study, using EIA coal price\nprojections, found that CLT would be competitive at oil prices of around $85 per barrel or\n\n3 National Research Council, Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards,\nWashington: National Academies Press, 2002, p. 3. The National Research Council is the operating arm of the\nNational Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine. Its reports are\nprepared by volunteer committees of experts, assisted by professional staff.\n4 The data for 1980 in this paragraph and the data for 2008 below were obtained from the Lawrence Livermore\nNational Laboratory: https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/archive.html#energy_archive. Oil not used in transportation or to\ngenerate electricity was used for heating and in industrial processes (e.g., to make plastic).\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2012\n\nhigher.5\n\nBetween 1980 and 1986 the world price of oil dropped by over 60%, making synthetic\nfuels, even when made with relatively cheap US coal, considerably more expensive than\npetroleum-derived fuels. During this same period the Synthetic Fuels Corporation was plagued\nby a variety of managerial problems and failed to bring any significant production capacity on\nline. During the 1980 campaign, President Reagan had promised to abolish the Department of\nEnergy because it unnecessarily interfered with the free market. On taking office, he\nimmediately eliminated price controls on petroleum products, to economists' universal applause.\nWhile eliminating the Department of Energy proved politically difficult, the Synthetic Fuels\nCorporation's performance and falling oil prices made it a much easier target over time, and\nPresident Reagan signed legislation in early 1986 abolishing it.\n) Because a variety of impurities are removed during their production, synthetic fuels\nderived from coal and most other feedstocks are virtually sulfur-free and burn more cleanly and\nwith less pollution than petroleum-derived fuels.\nElectricity Generation\nWhile oil consumption and oil imports rose sharply over the 1972-80 period, the amount of oil\nused to generate electricity actually fell by about 15%. The big winner was coal, use of which\nincreased by 55% over this period. In 1980, oil accounted for only about 14% of energy input\ninto electricity generation. This shift was mainly driven by price changes, not government\npolicies.\n\nWhile it may be good for energy security, using coal to generate electricity results in the\nemission of a variety of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulates\nof various sizes. (These same pollutants are generally emitted by oil-fired generating plants as\nwell, of course, but in different amounts.) Beginning with the Clean Air Act of 1970, Congress\nand the EPA responded to growing concern about air pollution by imposing pollution-control\nstandards on new generating plants. These standards were tightened over time. Proponents of\napplying standards only to new plants argued that the cost of retrofitting existing plants is\ngenerally higher than the cost of installing controls on new plants, so that forcing existing plants\nto retrofit would make many of them economic and force them to shut down prematurely.\nUnfortunately, this focus on new plants tended to make it economical to continue to operate old,\ndirty plants rather than to replace them with new plants for which expensive controls were\nrequired. (This policy approach has changed recently, as we will discuss later in the course.)\nEven with increasingly tough pollution control requirements, coal-fired power plants generally\nhad lower total costs per kWh generated than other generation technologies, and regions of the\nUS that made the heaviest use of coal tended to have the lowest electricity prices.\n\nDespite pollution control requirements, a recent report of the National Research Council\nconcluded that the operation of coal-fired power plants in 2005 resulted in environmental\ndamages (excluding climate change, which is discussed just below) of $62 billion, slightly higher\nthan the $56 billion attributed to the transportation sector.6\n\n5 Thomas J. Tarka, et al, Affordable Low-Carbon Diesel from Domestic Coal and Biomass, US Department of\nEnergy, National Energy Technology Laboratory, January 2009. This assumes no control of carbon dioxide\nemissions; see below.\nDamages per kilowatt-hour\ngenerated by coal-fired plants averaged $0.032, with a wide range: 5% of plants were below\n6 National Research Council, Hidden Costs of Energy: Unpriced Consequences of Energy Production and Use,\nWashington: National Academies Press, 2009.\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2012\n\n$0.005 per kWh, and 5% were above $0.12 per kWh. Not surprisingly, older plants tended to\nhave less effective pollution controls and higher damages per kWh. By comparison 95% of\nnatural gas-fired generating plants had damages below $0.01/kWh.\nClimate Change\nThe possibility of human-caused (i.e., anthropogenic) climate change didn't emerge as a widely\ndiscussed public issue until the late 1980s, after the decisions discussed above were made. The\nearth's temperature is regulated by the fact that water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and\na number of other \"greenhouse gases\" in the atmosphere reflect heat emitted by the earth back to\nthe earth's surface but don't reflect sunlight, thus warming the earth just as the glass in a\ngreenhouse keeps it warm by admitting sunlight but reflecting heat.7 Careful measurements\nbeginning in the 1960s showed a steady increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2,\nassociated with the use of fossil fuels, and it became clear that once emitted CO2 had an\natmospheric half-life on the order of a century.8\n\nCoal has a high carbon content, and combustion of coal thus produces more CO2 per unit\nof energy released than combustion of oil or natural gas. Using coal to generate electricity\nproduces roughly twice as much CO2 per kWh as using natural gas. Generation using nuclear\npower has no CO2 emissions, of course, nor does generation using wind or solar power, but at\ncurrent prices these generation technologies are considerably more expensive than coal or natural\ngas.\n(Concentrations of methane, which has a much\nshorter lifetime, have also been rising, along with those of other man-made greenhouse gases.)\nWhile great uncertainty still attaches to the detailed consequences of significant climate change -\nand thus to the damages per ton of CO2 emissions - there is a general consensus that it would\nproduce significant damages to many human and natural systems, damages that would pose\nparticularly severe challenges in poorer regions of the world. In any case, it would seem to\nrequire a very high tolerance for risk not to be frightened about running a massive experiment on\nthe only planet to which we have access to that is capable of sustaining human life.\n\nThe production of synthetic fuels from coal involves the production of substantial\namounts of CO2. If that gas is captured and sequestered underground, with costs estimated at\nbetween $3 and $10 per barrel,9\n\nIn the 1988 campaign, President George H.W. Bush promised to use \"the White House\neffect\" to counter the greenhouse effect. Since global emissions of greenhouse gases were\napparently producing global climate change, it was clear that what was wanted was a global\napproach to emissions reduction. In early 1990 the US hosted the first meeting in the\nnegotiations process that produced the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange in 1992. The Convention was quickly ratified by the US and more than 190 other\nthe total CO2 emissions per mile driven are comparable to (or\nperhaps even somewhat below) those of petroleum-based fuels. If sequestration is not done, life-\ncycle emissions per mile from synthetic fuels are estimated in various studies to be anywhere\nfrom 50% to 100% higher than from petroleum-based fuels.\n\n7 For more on the points discussed in this paragraph, see National Research Council, Advancing the Science of\nClimate Change: Report in Brief, Washington: National Academies Press, 2010.\n8 This gives the right order of magnitude but oversimplifies: the process of removing CO2 from the atmosphere is not\nwell modeled as exponential decay.\n9 Capture is apparently easy in this case, but sequestration has yet to be demonstrated at scale and thus its costs are\nuncertain.\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2012\n\nnations. International negotiations aimed at achieving the Convention's main goal - \"to stabilize\ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous\nanthropogenic interference with the climate system\" - have occurred regularly ever since. But\nno binding global agreement is in sight and, while some nations, notably the members of the\nEuropean Union, and some US states have subsequently taken steps to limit CO2 emissions, the\nUS has no comprehensive, national policy in place to do so.\nElectrification of Transportation\nEven though the US has dramatically reduced the use of oil for electricity generation, our\ntransportation system has become even more dependent on imported oil since the 1980s. In 2008\nabout 66% of petroleum consumption was imported. Seventy-one percent of oil was used in\ntransportation, where it supplied 95% of total primary energy consumed. The energy security\nconcerns that first surfaced in the 1970s have, if anything, become more serious. (Both Iran and\nVenezuela were major oil exporters and staunch US allies during the 1970s, for instance, while\nboth are generally hostile to the US today.)\n\nIn 2010 the first mainstream plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) and all-electric vehicles\n(EVs) appeared on the market,10\n\nA large-scale switch to PHEVs and EVs would reduce total oil consumption and thus,\nmost likely, consumption of imported oil. (It is much cheaper to produce oil in the Middle East\nthan in the US, so domestic production might fall substantially if a reduction in US demand\ndepressed world oil prices.) The environmental case for such a switch is somewhat less clear. In\nregions of the country that make heavy use of coal to generate electricity, greater penetration of\nEVs and PHEVs would most likely have little impact on per-mile CO2 emissions. (Careful\nstudies of the impact on per-mile damages from other pollutants do not seem to have been\npublished.) If vehicle batteries are charged with electricity generated by other technologies, of\ncourse, there will be a substantial reduction in per-mile CO2 emissions (and, most probably, in\nper-mile emissions of other pollutants as well).\nthough in small numbers despite a $7,500 per vehicle federal\nsubsidy. These vehicles, unlike first-generation hybrids like the Prius, enable electricity to\nsubstitute for gasoline. Absent breakthroughs in battery technology, both PHEVs and EVs are\nlikely to remain significantly more expensive to produce than equivalent petroleum-powered\nvehicles: the battery that gives a small PHEV a 20-mile all-electric range costs about $6,000.\nMost studies find that the reduced operating cost of PHEVs and EVs is unlikely to make up for\ntheir increased initial cost over plausible lifetimes at reasonable discount rates. (We'll come\nback to this later in the course.)\n\nQuestions for Class Discussion:\n1. What is the argument for government interference in private markets to produce a better\nenvironmental outcome? Even if that argument is persuasive, why should the federal\ngovernment get involved?\n\n10 The Tesla all-electric sports car was first marketed in 2008, with a price tag of $109,000.\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2012\n\n2. In 1970, should the EPA have been instructed to do cost-benefit analysis in setting the\nNAAQS? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using market-based pollution\ncontrol methods such as taxes or cap-and-trade systems?\n\n3. In 1973, would you have advised President Nixon to announce Project Independence? Why\nor why not? How important is energy independence, and why? How much should we be\nwilling to pay for it - in dollars per gallon of gasoline, for instance?\n\n4. In 1975, would you have advised President Ford to support establishment of the CAFE\nprogram or much higher motor fuel taxes - or neither? Why? How else might the US have\nreduced its use of oil?\n\n5. In 1980, would you have advised President Carter to establish something like the Synthetic\nFuels Corporation? Why?\n\n6. In 1986, would you have advised President Reagan to abolish the Synthetic Fuels\nCorporation? What facts would you like to have (facts that he might have had at the time!) in\norder to evaluate this decision?\n\n7. Suppose that the Synthetic Fuels Corporation had been better managed that by 1986 the US\nhad had the capacity to meet most of its demand for gasoline and diesel fuel from domestic\nCTL plants. Suppose also, as would likely have been the case, that those synthetic fuels\nwould be considerably more expensive than petroleum-derived fuels.

      "content": "15.031J Teaching Note\n\nSpring 2012\n\nNote on the Economics of Energy Demand1\n\nThis note discusses the following topics in the economics of energy demand: energy\ndemand as a derived demand, methods of estimating energy demand elasticities, results of\ndemand elasticity estimation, and some findings that suggest that the basic economic model of\nenergy demand is incomplete.\nDerived Demand\nIt is hard to believe that anybody really wants to consume electricity, natural gas,\ngasoline, or coal directly; doing so would be unpleasant at best and fatal at worst. The demand\nfor energy is, rather, derived from the demand for services it is used to produce.2 Gasoline,\nvehicles, and labor are the main inputs into the production of transportation services, for\ninstance. Some residential demand for electricity is derived from the demand for food\npreparation. Commercial demand for electricity is largely derived from demands for heat, light,\ncooling, and, increasingly, computation; and these are ultimately derived from demand for firms'\noutputs. As Smil (2000) documents, global energy demand increased dramatically during the\n20th century, but the efficiency with which energy services were produced increased even more\nrapidly.\n\nA simple transportation example illustrates some properties of derived demand. In the\nshort run, with John's car given and neglecting the influence of income, weather, and other\nvariables, it is reasonable to suppose that the miles of auto transportation he demands, T, is lower\nthe higher is the cost per mile of driving, CT. Let us further suppose that the relation between\nthese quantities can be approximated by\n(1)\n\nT = a(CT)-e,\nwhere a and e are positive constants. Note that e is the elasticity of demand of T with respect to\nits cost, CT:\n(2)\n\n- (dT/dCT)(CT/T) = e.\n\nIn the short run, ignoring the cost (positive or negative) of the time John spends driving,\nthe production function for this energy service, miles of auto transportation, is approximately\ngiven by\n(3)\n\nT = mG,\nwhere m is a positive constant that gives John's car's mileage in miles per gallon, and G is the\nconsumption of gasoline used to produce T miles of transportation.\n\n1 This note was prepared for classroom use only. Please do not reproduce, cite, or quote from it.\n2 The theory of derived demand was initially developed to show how an industry's demand for labor depended on\nthe demand for its output, as well as the production function used to produce that output.\n\n15.031J Teaching Note\n\nSpring 2012\n\nDenote the per-gallon price of gasoline by PG. In order to derive the demand equation for\ngasoline, we need to solve for T and CT in the energy service demand equation (1) as functions\nof G and PG. In this case the simple production function (3) makes this easy:\n(4a)\n\nT[miles] = m[miles/gallon]G[gallons], and\n(4b)\n\nCT[$/mile] = PG[$/gallon]/m[miles/gallon].\nUnits are shown in brackets - they are always worth checking. Substituting from (4) into (1), we\nobtain\n(5a)\n\nmG = a(PG/m)-e, which simplifies to\n(5b)\n\nG = a(m)e-1(PG)-e.\n\nA couple of things are worth noting about the derived demand equation (5). First, the\nprice elasticity of demand for gasoline is exactly equal to the price elasticity of demand for\ntransportation services. This is not generally the case, however; the derived demand for an input\nmay be more or less elastic than the output demand function from which it is derived.3\n\nWhat about the long run, in which all inputs (including, in particular, John's car) are\nvariable?\nSecond,\nunless e = 0, doubling John's car's mileage will not cut his demand for gasoline in half. In fact,\nif e > 1, increasing his car's mileage will increase his demand for gasoline. This happens\nbecause raising m lowers the per-mile cost of driving, thus tending to increase John's demand for\ntransportation. (This point is made by critics of CAFE standards, but almost nobody argues that\ne in fact exceeds one for cars in the real world.)\n\nThe output effect is the whole story in the example above: John can only respond to an\nincrease in the price of gasoline by reducing his demand for the transportation services it\nproduces. It follows that the less elastic is the demand for the final service (the smaller is e in the\nexample above), the less elastic will be the demand for the input that produces it, because the\noutput effect will be smaller.\nIn the long run an increase in the price of energy (gasoline in the example above) will\nreduce energy demand through both an output effect and a substitution effect.\n\nThe substitution effect arises when it is possible to respond to an energy price increase by\nproducing the same quantity of services using less energy, by substituting other inputs. In our\nexample, in the long run John might well respond to an increase in the price of gasoline by\nbuying a higher-mileage car. A general principle, first stated clearly by Paul Samuelson, implies\nthat increasing the number of inputs a firm or household can vary in response to a change in the\nprice of any one input gives more scope for the substitution effect and thus makes demand more\nprice-elastic. So one generally expects long-run price elasticities of demand to exceed short-run\n\n3 Suppose, for instance, that John's car could run just as well on diesel fuel and that diesel fuel and gasoline were\nselling at the same price. Even a tiny increase in the price of gasoline would then be expected to reduce the demand\nfor gasoline to zero.\n4 In the economic long run, technology is assumed fixed. To avoid various sorts of confusion it is important to\ndistinguish between changes made over time in response to, e.g., price changes with a given set of technological\npossibilities, on the one hand, and changes caused by improvements in technology over time, on the other hand.\n\n15.031J Teaching Note\n\nSpring 2012\n\nprice elasticities, and, as we discuss below, the available evidence is consistent with this\nexpectation.\n\nIt is also interesting to know how energy demand varies with household income or, in the\ncase of businesses, with the volume of production. Samuelson's general principle that more\nscope for reaction implies a larger reaction means that long-run income (or production)\nelasticities of demand for energy will tend to exceed short-run elasticities, and that, too, is what\nis generally observed.\nEstimating Demand Elasticities\nMany technical articles have been written on problems associated with the estimation of\ndemand elasticities. Here we will briefly discuss two that arise regularly in demand estimation:\nensuring identification and allowing for dynamic behavior.\n\nIt is important to recognize that in practice, it is usually at least as important to scrutinize\nthe available data carefully as to use appropriate statistical methods. Schmalensee and Stoker\n(1999), for instance, report a statistical study of gasoline demand using survey data on individual\nhouseholds and state-of-the-art estimation methods. They report plausible price elasticity\nestimates but note that subsequent discussions with the government agency that provided the\ndata revealed that the household-level price data did not in fact measure prices that households\nfaced, so the estimated elasticities were meaningless!\nIdentification\nAmong the first applications of statistical methods in economics was the estimation of\ndemand functions for wheat, corn, and other agricultural commodities. Data were abundant, and\nthe response of prices to changes in harvests was of great interest to farmers and others.\nUnfortunately, a number of early studies concluded that increases in price would increase the\nquantity demanded! Because the scatters of observed price/quantity observations tended upward,\nthe estimated demand curves had positive slopes.\n\nPrices and quantities are determined by both supply and demand, of course. Suppose the\ndemand curve is perfectly stable and the supply curve is shifted by changes in such things as the\nweather and farmers' costs. In this case, which the analysts were implicitly assuming, shifts in\nthe supply curve will serve to trace out the demand curve. Now suppose the supply curve is\nstable and changes in income, tastes, and other factors shift the demand curve. In this case, the\nshifts in the demand curve would trace out the supply curve.\n\nIn reality, neither the demand curve nor the supply curve in any market is likely to be\nperfectly stable, and the scatter of points generated by their intersections (that is, by the market)\ncould have a positive, negative, or zero slope, depending on the shapes of the curves and the\nrelative sizes of their shifts. In this situation one can only observe the solution to a pair of\nsimultaneous equations, and the problem of figuring out how to estimate the parameters of one\nor more of the underlying equations is termed the identification problem.\n\nBecause prices in energy markets are generally affected by simultaneous (or near-\nsimultaneous) decisions by suppliers and demanders, the identification problem also arises in\nattempts to estimate demand functions for particular forms of energy. Thus Kamerschen and\nPorter (2004) obtain estimates of upward-sloping electricity demand curves. Their solution -\nand solutions to the identification problem in other settings - involves finding variables that shift\n\n15.031J Teaching Note\n\nSpring 2012\n\none of the curves but not the other. As the two extreme cases discussed above suggest, to\nestimate the demand curve one needs variables that shift supply but not demand, while to\nestimate the supply curve one needs variables that shift demand but not supply.\n\nTo see how this works in a very simple case, suppose the supply function in the market\nfor wheat is assumed to be\n(6a)\n\nQS = α + βP - γPG + ε\nwhere QS is the quantity of wheat supplied, P is the price of wheat, PG is the price of gasoline, ε\nis an error or disturbance terms (i.e., a random variable summarizing the effects of omitted\nfactors), and α, β, and γ are unknown positive constants. Similarly, suppose the demand\nfunction in this market is assumed to be\n(6b)\n\nQD = a - bP + cI + e,\nwhere QD is the quantity of wheat demanded, P is as before, I is consumer income, e is an error\nor disturbance term, and a, b, and c are unknown positive constants. The observations available\nare where supply equals demand:\n(6c)\n\nQ = QD = QS.\n\nIn order actually to estimate the coefficients in (6), one would have to make some\nassumptions about the random (or error) terms ε and e and use an appropriate statistical method.\nBefore getting that far, however, one has to ask whether it is possible in principle to estimate\nthose coefficients, even if the error terms were zero. To address that question, set the error terms\nin (6) equal to zero and solve for Q and P as functions of I and PG:\n(7a)\n\nP = [(a-α )/(b+ β)] + [c/(b+ β)]I + [γ/(b+ β)]PG, and\n(7b)\n\nQ = [(aβ +αb)/(b+ β)] + [cβ/(b+ β)]I - [bγ/(b+ β)]PG\nGiven data on all the quantities involved, it should be possible to estimate the coefficients in\nbrackets in equations (7). Let us assume that we have \"good\" estimates of these (reduced form)\ncoefficients. Is it possible to use those estimates to compute estimates of b and/or β?\n\nFour cases naturally arise. First, if c = γ = 0, we are back where we started: all we can\nestimate are the intercepts in (7), and there is no way to go from them to any of the (structural)\ncoefficients in (6). Now suppose that γ = 0 and c > 0, so we only have a variable that shifts the\ndemand curve. In this case the ratio of the estimated coefficients of I gives us an estimate of β,\nbut there is no way to get an estimate of b. In this case the supply curve shifts, and the data trace\nout the demand curve. Similarly, if c = 0 and γ > 0, we can estimate b but not β. Finally, if γ > 0\nand c > 0, we can go back from estimates of the coefficients in (7) to all the coefficients in (6).\nIn this case, we say that both equations are identified.\nDynamic Behavior\nWe noted above that the long-run response to change in prices or incomes is likely to\ndiffer from and, generally, to be larger than the short-run response. In the case of energy, the\n\n15.031J Teaching Note\n\nSpring 2012\n\ndifference between the short run and the long run mainly has to do with changes in fixed assets\nlike automobiles, appliances, industrial equipment, and the like. However, it also reflects job and\nhousing choices and the associated commuting and shopping patterns, as well as changes in\ntransportation for a given commuting pattern e.g. car-pools, public transportation, bicycles, and\nwalking. If one had household or firm data that included information on fixed assets and other\ndurable choices, one might be able to model the process of changing those assets as part of the\nresponse to changes in price and other variables. But such data are rarely if ever available.\n\nInstead, modelers commonly make assumptions about the form of response over time and\nuse data to estimate the speed of that response. Perhaps the most common assumption is the so-\ncalled partial adjustment model:\n(8a)\n\nQ(t) - Q(t-1) = λ[Q*(X1, X2, ..., XN) - Q(t-1)],\nwhere Q(t) is the quantity demanded in period t, Q* is the long-run demand function that\ndescribes behavior after all adjustments (including acquiring new assets) are complete, the X's\nare the variables that determine long-run demand, and λ is a positive constant to be estimated.\nThe assumption here is that the adjustment process eliminates a constant fraction, λ, of the\ndifference between long-run (or equilibrium) demand and actual demand in each period. Re-\narranging (8a) yields\n(8b)\n\nQ(t) = λQ*(X1, X2, ..., XN) + (1-λ) Q(t-1),\nMaking some assumption about the form of Q* (as in (6b), above) yields an equation in\nwhich Q(t) is a function of Q(t-1) and the X's, with the coefficient of Q(t-1) providing an\nestimate of λ. Long-run elasticities are computed from the Q* function; short-run elasticities are\nsmaller by the factor λ.\n\nThere are many other approaches to modeling dynamic adjustment, of course.\nHuntington (2010), for instance, hypothesizes that the choice of vehicles or other fixed assets is\naffected by the world oil price only when it rises above its previous maximum, PMAX. He\ndecomposes the actual world oil price, P, into two components: PMAX and [P- PMAX]. He argues\nthat the world oil price is not affected by US demand, so that he can simply estimate an equation\nlike (6b) directly, without worrying further about identification. (One could question that\nassumption, of course.) He finds that the first of these components has a stronger effect on\ndemand than the second, yielding long-run elasticity estimates above the short-run estimates.\nDemand Elasticity Estimates\nThere are literally hundreds of published studies that estimate price and income\nelasticities for various forms of energy in various places over various periods using data of\nvarious sorts and employing various statistical methods and modeling strategies.5\n\n5 If I is income and Q is quantity demanded, the income elasticity of demand is simply (∂Q/∂I)(I/Q), where the\npartial derivative is used when demand has more than one determinant.\nNot\nsurprisingly, the results of these studies vary substantially - probably a great deal more than the\nunderlying behavior.\n\n15.031J Teaching Note\n\nSpring 2012\n\nPrice and income elasticities of demand are not physical constants, of course. Estimates\nof these quantities based on historical data are simply summaries of the behavior of particular\nhuman beings in particular times and places. Patterns of human behavior do not generally\nchange suddenly and substantially, so well-constructed elasticity estimates can help predict\nresponses to future price and income changes. But behavior does change.\n\nTwo general patterns emerge clearly from this large literature. First, long-run elasticities\nare larger than short-run elasticities, as the theory predicts, and often much larger. Given that\nlong-run adjustment of energy demand generally involves changes in long-lived assets like cars\nand buildings, this is not a surprise. Second, short-run price and income elasticities tend to be\nsmall, generally well under 0.5. This, too, is not a great surprise: think about the major energy\nservices your parents consume and think how easily it would be for them to decrease their\nconsumption substantially in a short time in response to an energy price increase. Would they\nlive in the dark? Turn the heat way down in the winter? Give up air conditioning? Cook less?\nWalk to work and to shop?\n\nThe demands for gasoline and residential electricity seem to have been the most studied:\nsee Goodwin et al (2004) and Espey and Espey (2004) for comprehensive and fairly recent\nreviews. The table below summarizes one person's view of the ranges of \"reasonable\" estimates\nof price and income elasticities for these commodities in rich countries:\nGasoline\nElectricity\nPrice Elasticity\nShort-Run\n.15 - .25\n.20 - .40\nLong-Run\n.50 - .70\n.50 - .80\nIncome Elasticity Short-Run\n.30 - .50\n.15 - .30\nLong-Run\n.60 - 1.10 .80 - 1.10\n\nAn important reason for the high long-run income elasticity for gasoline seems to be a tendency\nfor people to buy larger and, generally, less fuel-efficient vehicles as they become wealthier.\nHome appliances presumably play a similar role in shaping long-run residential electricity\ndemand.\n\nEstimates of various other energy demand elasticities are scattered throughout the\nliterature. In the US National Energy Modeling System (built and operated by the Energy\nInformation Agency), for instance, the assumed short-run and long-run price elasticities of\ndemand for natural gas are .14 and .40, respectively.\n\nAs noted above, behavior patterns do change - most often change gradually but\nsometimes abruptly - so that estimated demand elasticities must be used with caution. Hughes et\nal (2008) and others have argued that the price elasticity of demand for gasoline fell substantially\nafter 1980, for instance. This may be a reaction to the fact that with lower oil prices and more\nefficient cars, the inflation-adjusted per-mile cost of driving and the share of gasoline in\nhousehold budgets were both much lower in the 1980s and 1990s than in the 1960s and 1970s.\nSimilarly, as we will discuss in class, the demand function for electricity appears to have shifted\nsubstantially in recent decades.\n\n15.031J Teaching Note\n\nSpring 2012\n\nChallenges to the Economic Model\nIn recent years, the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company has joined a\nnumber of advocacy organizations and contended that firms and households in the U.S. (and in\nother nations) have failed to make many economic investments in energy efficiency. They find\n(McKinsey 2009) that investments of about $520 billion would yield a net payoff of $680 billion.\nMcKinsey measures the net payoff as the net present value of energy savings, computed using a\n7% discount rate, minus the initial investment cost.\n\nThe first reaction of many economists when assertions of this sort were first made in the\n1970s was that the engineering calculations involved were too optimistic, particularly about the\ncosts of making old buildings more energy-efficient. These criticisms had some validity, but\nmost observers now seem convinced that there are in fact real examples of investments in energy\nefficiency that would be profitable at reasonable discount rates but are not made, though the\nmagnitude of these opportunities is still controversial.\n\nHausman and Joskow (1982) offer a simple explanation for this failure to harvest\nattractive, low-hanging fruit: they point to a number of studies that showed that in making\ndecisions regarding energy-efficient versus energy-inefficient appliances, consumers acted as if\nthey had very high discount rates. Suppose, for instance, that spending an extra $100 on a\ncentral air conditioner would reduce electricity cost by $10.50 per year. Assuming, for\nsimplicity, that the air conditioner lasts forever and that interest is compounded continuously,i\n\nNPV7 = 10.5/.07 - 100 = 150 - 100 = 50,\n\nthe net present value of this investment using a 7% discount rate, as McKinsey did, would be\nand this would appear to be an attractive investment. But if the household were using a 20%\ndiscount rate instead the net present value would be negative,\n\nNPV20 = 10.5/.20 - 100 = 52.5 - 100 = - 47.5,\nindicating a very unattractive investment.\n\nThere are two basic problems with this explanation, however. First, while consumers\nwho can't get loans might use a discount rate well above published loan rates, it is by no means\nobvious why most consumers would do so. It is perhaps even less obvious why businesses\nwould behave as if they used very high discount rates, particularly large business that can access\nthe capital markets and that have formal processes to evaluate possible investments.\n\nSecond, it is clear that at least some consumers do not treat all investments in energy\nsavings in this way. About two million Toyota Prius cars have been sold world-wide, more than\n800,000 in the US. The main difference between a Prius and a Toyota Corolla is that the Prius\ngets better mileage. As we will discuss in class, buying a Prius to save on gasoline makes sense\nonly if one drives much more than average and applies a very low discount rate. But it is not\nrational for consumers to use two different discount rates to evaluate two different sorts of\ninvestment in energy efficiency. Either consumers are being irrational or the choice between a\nPrius and a Corolla involves more than comparing up-front costs and fuel costs - or both.\n\nMcKinsey (2009) offers some alternative explanations for society's apparent persistent\nunder-investment in energy efficiency, and we will discuss them and other factors in later class\nsessions.\n\n15.031J Teaching Note\n\nSpring 2012\n\nReferences\nEspey, J.A. and M.

      "content": "Biodiesel@MIT, a teaching note\n\nS. Silbey\nBiodiesel@MIT\nOn May 13, 2008, the MIT student newspaper, The Tech, ran a cover story\ndescribing how the student run Biodiesel@MIT project, which aimed to reprocess\nused vegetable oil from campus dining facilities into eco-friendly biodiesel fuel to\npower campus shuttle buses, was about to close shop. A year earlier,\nBiodiesel@MIT had won a prestigious $25,000 prize from the mtvU/General\nElectric Ecomagination Challenge. The project team members had planned to use\nthe prize funds to purchase a biodiesel fuel processor and to retrofit space on\ncampus to house the equipment. Joseph D. Roy-Mayhew '08 originally came up\nwith the project in 2006 as part of an IAP (Independent Activities Period)\nseminar, and had \"hoped to have the project fueling MIT's shuttles by the start of\nthe 2007 academic year.\" Unfortunately, things hadn't gone quite as planned.\nFifteen months after securing the capital and garnering national notice for their\ninnovative proposal, Biodiesel@MIT was no more. So it seemed when this story\nran in the May 13, 2008, The Tech.\nWhat went wrong? What can we learn about organizational decision-making by\nlooking more closely at the fate of this energy conservation project at an\norganization of close to 20,000 members arrayed in four basic population\ngroups: students, faculty, administration, and support staff for the physical\nplant?\nThe Energy Issue\nIn 2006, MIT estimated that it used over 800 gallons of diesel and 2,300 gallons\nof gasoline yearly to run shuttle buses around campus. In July 2007, the Institute\nbegan replacing aging gasoline vehicles with diesel vehicles, reversing the fuel\nconsumption balance to 2,400 gallons of diesel and 700 gallons of gasoline. In\naddition, MIT uses approximately 150 gallons of diesel and 1,700 gallons of\ngasoline per month to run maintenance and landscaping vehicles and equipment.\nCumulatively across all uses, MIT estimated in 2007 that it would be using\napproximately 30,000 gallons of diesel annually for fueling purposes.1\nAlthough diesel is a more efficient fuel (with more energy per gallon available for\npowering a vehicle), its lack of availability relative to gasoline, higher purchase\ncost and poor performance for early diesel vehicles had prevented widespread\nadoption in the US during the 20th century. European tax systems favored diesel\nbecause of the better mileage and over time improved the engines considerably\nfor automobiles as well as railroads, making them more readily available.\n\"A diesel engine gets more miles-per-gallon than an equivalent gasoline engine...\n1 The biodiesel proposal was confusing with regard to annual v monthly consumption. Can we get\nthis checked?\n\nBiodiesel@MIT, a teaching note\n\nS. Silbey\nbecause diesel fuel has a higher energy density - on average, a gallon of gasoline\ncontains 85 to 87 percent of the BTUs (British Thermal Units) of energy of a\ngallon of diesel fuel. Diesel engines are also more efficient than their gasoline\ncounterparts because more power is produced as a result of the higher\ncompression of the air/fuel mixture. Today's gasoline engines have compression\nratios of about 10:1 to 11:1, while the compression ratios in diesels can be as high\nas 25:1. The higher the compression ratio, the more power generated. The much\nhigher compression ratio means diesel engines have to be heavier and more\nrobust. This means they are more expensive to build, but the higher cost is offset\nby much longer lifetimes. For instance, we've seen Mercedes-Benz diesels with\n350,000 or more miles on the odometer running great on the original engine.\nBecause of higher component weight and high compression ratios, diesels\noperate at lower rpms, producing lots of low end torque but less horsepower.\n\"2\nWhy bio-diesel?\nRecycled biodiesel is produced by coverting used vegetable oil from cooking into\nfuel for engines. When burned in internal combustion engineers, it has\nsignificantly lower CO2 emissions than standard diesel fuels. It is currently the\nonly alternative fuel to have completed the EPA-required Tier I and Tier II health\neffects testing under the Clean Air Act.3 Over its life cycle, commercial - rather\nthan recycled - biodiesel is less greenhouse gas intensive than petroleum-based\ndiesel, although biodiesel created from virgin vegetable oil emits more pollutants\nfrom agricultural and electricity generation than when produced from recycled\noils. Importantly, recycled biodiesel has significantly lower Co2 and life cycle\nemissions than commercial biodiesel because the input is local used vegetable\noils left over from cooking. Thus, the agriculture, transport, and crushing steps\nof the commercial biodiesel generation process are bypassed. When used\nvegetable oil is recycled at a small scale, the electricity consumed during\nproduction of biodiesel is greater per metric ton; however, even with the\nincreased emissions from this electricity consumption the result in lower overall\nemissions when compared to petro-diesel production and the initial processes in\ncommercial biodiesel production.\nBiodiesel is made through a chemical process called transesterification whereby\nthe glycerin is separated from the fat or vegetable oil. The process leaves behind\ntwo products -- methyl esters (the chemical name for biodiesel) and glycerin (a\nvaluable byproduct usually sold to be used in soaps and other products).\nBiodiesel (meeting ASTM D6751 standards) refers to the pure fuel before\nblending with diesel fuel. Biodiesel blends are denoted as, \"BXX\" with \"XX\"\nrepresenting the percentage of biodiesel contained in the blend (ie: B20 is 20%\n2 http://www.greencar.com/articles/difference-between-diesel-gasoline-engines.php, 1/22/2011.\n3 Clean Air act\n\nBiodiesel@MIT, a teaching note\nS. Silbey\nbiodiesel, 80% petroleum diesel).\nBiodiesel contains no sulfur or aromatics, and use of biodiesel in a conventional\ndiesel engine results in substantial reduction of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon\nmonoxide and particulate matter. A U.S. Department of Energy study showed\nthat the production and use of biodiesel, compared to petroleum diesel, resulted\nin a 78.5% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, biodiesel has a\npositive energy balance. For every unit of energy needed to produce a gallon of\nbiodiesel, 3.24 units of energy are gained.4 Although recycled biodiesel requires\nmore electricity, it is the most renewable and efficient fuel over its life cycle.5\n- Petroleum-based diesel requires 1.1995 fossil fuel units for 1 unit of fuel.\nCommercial biodiesel requires 0.31; recycled biodiesel, 0.2090.\n- Over its life cycle, petroleum-based diesel emits 633.28gCO2/g/bhp-hr.6\nCommercial biodiesel emits 21.55% of this amount and recycled biodiesel\nemits 2.42% of this amount.\n- The life cycle energy efficiency (fuel energy divided by total energy needed\nto produce fuel, including the fuel itself) of petroleum-based diesel is\n83.28%. Commercial biodiesel is 80.55% and recycled biodiesel is 99.1%.\n- Tailpipe NOx emissions are, however, 8.89% greater for biodiesel than for\npetroleum-based diesel.7\n- Life cycle NOx emissions are 13.35% greater for commercial biodiesel than\nfor petroleum-based diesel, and 4.36% greater for recycled biodiesel than\nfor petroleum-based diesel.\nHowever,\n- Tailpipe CO emissions are 68% lower for biodiesel than for petroleum-\nbased diesel.\n4 National Biodiesel Board - www.nbb.org\n5 Biodiesel@MIT, March 2007 Proposal.\n6 EPA Tier 1-3 Nonroad Diesel Engine Emission Standards g/kWH (g/bhp.hr)\n7 Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are formed when nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) are combined\nat high temperatures and pressure during the combustion of fuel. All fuels, such as\ngasoline, diesel, biodiesel, propane, coal, and ethanol, emit NOx when burned.The EPA\nestimates that 49% of NOx emissions come from on-road and off-road vehicles, 27%\nfrom power generation (electric utilities) and the remaining 24% from industrial,\ncommercial and residential sources. Since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, all\nprimary air pollutants have decreased - except NOx, which has increased by 10%. NOx is\nan odorless gas when combined with particulate matter appears reddish-brown (smog). It\nis known to contribute to asthma, emphysema and bronchitis, aggravates existing heart\ndisease, damages lungs. It is a component in ground-level ozeon and smog, contributes\nto acid rain and leads to oxygen depletion in bodies of water, upsetting the chemical\nbalance to aquatic environments, contributes to global warming and climate change. It\nmay also contribute to biological mutations.\n\nBiodiesel@MIT, a teaching note\nS. Silbey\n- Tailpipe SOx emissions are eliminated in biodiesel.\n- Life cycle SOx emissions are 8% less for commercial biodiesel, and 93%\nless for recycled biodiesel than diesel.\nBecause biodiesel can be manufactured using existing industrial production\ncapacity, and used with conventional equipment, it provides opportunity to\nprovide energy domestically, thus addressing issues concerning energy security\nas well as deficit reduction. \"For instance, in 1996, it was estimated that the\nmilitary costs of securing foreign oil was $57 billion annually. Foreign tax credits\naccounted for another estimated $4 billion annually and environmental costs\nwere estimated at $45 per barrel. For every billion dollars spent on foreign oil,\nAmerica lost 10,000 - 25,000 jobs.\"8\nWhy Biodiesel@MIT?9\nIn its March 2007 submission to the Ecomagination Challenge, Biodiesel@MIT\nproposed to supply 25,000 gallons of B20 to cover MIT's annual diesel usage,\nreplacing 5,000 gallons of petro-diesel with biodiesel at a ratio of 1 part biodiesel\nto 4 parts petro-diesel.10 Biodiesel would supply approximately 20% of MIT's\ndiesel needs by recycling used cooking oils from campus kitchens. The plan\nwould be environmentally and economically beneficial.\nIf implemented, the recycled biodiesel produced from used vegetable oil would,\nover its life cycle, reduce CO2 emissions by a factor of 40,11 by over 108.1 tons a\nyear, the equivalent of taking 9.3 fossil-fuel powered cars off the road.12 In\naddition to reducing emissions, the proposed biodiesel system would turn waste\ninto a usable resource by reducing costs associating with disposing cooking oils as\nwell as the pollution from transporting the disposed oils. By recycling used\nvegetable oil on associated pollution from its transport. MIT would resemble\nmore of a closed looped sustainable system and start to \"walk the talk\" of\nsustainability.\n8 National Biodiesel Board - www.nbb.org\n9 This text borrows from Biodiesel@MIT, March 2007.\n10 \"Since B20 is a blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% petro-diesel, this goal would require the annual\nproduction of 6,360 gallons of pure biodiesel (B100). Biodiesel fuel is typically blended with\npetroleum-based diesel to maintain engine performance, with the blending percentages denoted\nby Bxx where xx indicates the biodiesel percentage in the blend.\" Biodiesel@MIT, March 2007.\n11 Roy-Mayhew, Joe. \"Comparative Life Cycle Analysis of Diesel, Commercial Biodiesel, and\nBiodiesel\nproduced from WVO.\" <http://web.mit.edu/zepster/Public/Biodiesel/Comparative%20Life%20\nCycle%20Analysis%20of%20fuels.doc>.

Silbey\nFurthermore, the biodiesel project had research and teaching components,\nserving as a model for the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI), displaying to local and\nnational audiences MIT's commitment. From its outset, Biodiesel@MIT was part\nof the Institute's educational program, having been initiated through a student\nworkshop and collaboration of 16 students, supported by approximately 20\nfaculty with whom they consulted. The entire process of converting used\nvegetable oil to biodiesel could serve as a living classroom for students at MIT\nand others in the local Cambridge and Boston areas. The processor, its inputs and\noutputs could be available for study and modeling for various subjects including\nchemistry, chemical engineering, or systems engineering, as well as a simple\nlogistics problem for entrepreneurship and small business classes, possibly with\nthe economics of the production used as a case study.\nImplementing Biodiesel@MIT\nTo begin, Biodiesel@MIT proposed a two-stage model. In the transition stage,\n200 gallons of B100 would be produced per month to test the process and\nproduct. This transitory stage would be scaled up to a steady-state stage with\nproduction of 5,000 gallons of B100 per year, which would provide 25,000\ngallons of usable diesel fuel, 20% of MIT's usage at the time.\nTo bring this plan to fruition would require capital, space and coordination with\nservice and facilities staff and fuel provision processes.\nThe project leaders approached Institute administrators before even finalizing\nthe project design, way back in 2006. Basically ignored by the administration,\nthey were advised to find independent sources to fund the project and space to\nhouse it. The team considered four different locations, all of which would need\nmodifications to support the processor's water, power, sewage or safety demands.\nThe team projected $3000 for safety purposes.\nAfter winning the GE Ecomagination competition with a $25,000 prize, the team\nlooked for space to house the converter, storage and distribution processes. At\nthe same time, the prize money was delayed in arriving and coordination between\nfinding spaces, ordering the converter and renovating spaces occupied the team\nfor the next year. For over one year, 2007-2008, the team looked for sites on\ncampus, receiving $35,000 estimates from facilities for renovation of two\ndifferent spaces. The estimates included items the team had not anticipated,\nespecially safety, sewage and related costs.\nAlthough \"the $35,000 was beyond the project's prize money (which was also\nneeded to purchase a $15,000 fuel processor), MIT's Committee for Review of\nSpace Planning (CRSP), reporting to the Provost, offered to loan money to\nsupport the project\" (Tech May 13, 2008). Given what they experienced as\n\nBiodiesel@MIT, a teaching note\nS. Silbey\nstalling and lack of interest, the team was surprised by CRSP's offer to share the\nexpenses. All agreed that the loan would be paid back by the Institute purchasing\nthe biodiesel from the processor.\nHowever, estimates from the Environmental Heath and Safety office and the\nfacilities staff kept rising. Eventually, the recycling area costs increased to\n$60,000 and then to $137,000. CRSP was on board for the $60,000 but\n$137,000 was stretching their own budgets.\nThe increased costs were only partially specified, although safety and fire\nequipment was a large part.\nTeam members had no idea that so much renovation would be involved to retrofit\na space for the processor, and how much safety protection was going to be\nnecessary. Thus, their original project plan had significantly underestimated the\nproject costs when they submitted their proposals. The team was simply not\naware of all the environmental, health and safety issues would be involved in a\nfuel processor, especially fire suppression and spill mitigation. The\nEnvironmental Health and Safety staff identified these issues and began to design\nresponses.\nDuring the 2007-2008 year, the Facilities department was also undergoing\nleadership and organizational changes, eventually splitting the department into\ntwo divisions. The Biodiesel team ended up working with personnel who had\nbeen on the job only a few months. \"Facilities sort of admitted that they ... didn't\noriginally carry out a ... robust enough analysis of each location,\" Sara Barnowski\n'10, 2008 President of the Biodiesel@MIT team. Nonetheless, CRSP and\nFacilities managed to bring costs back down near $60,000 and assigned a\nmanager in the Facilities Department to direct renovations of the lower level of\nthe Grounds Garage, where campus maintenance equipment is stored. With this\nagreement in place, the project team began the legal work to purchase the\nprocessor; MIT required them to purchase a commercial bioreactor rather than\nmake their own. With an augmented team including UROPS, the Biodiesel@MIT\nmoved ahead, expecting renovations to the garage to be complete by May 2008.\nAfter purchasing the $15,000 processor, hiring 3 UROPS, and thinking that they\nhad everything in place, the project team learned from CRSP in early May (May\n8, 2008), that installation in the garage was not feasible, but that installation in\nW92, a building currently housing Student & Administrative Information\nSystems (SAIS), Information Services & Technology (IS&T), Student Services\nInformation Technology. This seemed a peculiar choice compared to the\nGrounds Garage. More importantly, this space would need nearly $80,000\nrenovation, $20,000 more than the garage space. At $80,000 the\nimplementation of Biodiesel@MIT was far in excess of similar projects elsewhere\nin the U.S. About $50,000 was estimated for the health and safety systems.\n\nBiodiesel@MIT, a teaching note\nS. Silbey\nUnfortunately, CRSP could not provide more than it has offered when the project\nwas $60,000; \"there is a limit to how much we can put into one student project,\"\nchair of CRSP explained. \"We have lots of requests... at some point in the future,\nmaybe things will change.\"\nThe team was left with few options. They considered off campus locations but\nthat did not seem likely. When the May 13, 2008 story ran, the team was\nconsidering options to cancel the processor purchase and return the $25,000\nprize money. They had already brokered of fuel swap with a shuttle leasing\ncompany to avoid non-profit/for-profit issues. \"Money or not,\" the Tech\nreported, \"the failure to bring a biodiesel process to MIT may take away from\nMIT's educational experience.\" Barnowski elaborated: \"There's definitely a loss of\nan academic resource. Course 10 has implemented a lot of biodiesel modules for\nChemical-Biological Engineering Laboratory 10.28,\" including \"projects to design\nquality control kits for biodiesel processors, but now students have no place to\ntest their designs or see their real-world applications.\" She was disappointed that\nthe project would not be implemented. \"The people I've talked to feel that is\nreally unfair and hypocritical ... to be pushing new Energy Initiative [when] even\nthis project with so much funding and support couldn't get implemented,\" she\nsaid. \"We had a lot of theoretical support from higher up in the administration,\"\nbut no one seemed to take on the project. \"No one was really specifically willing\nto donate their time, or money, or their space to the project. It sort of got lost in\nthe middle.\"\nSeptember 2008: Biodiesel@MIT Finds a Home\nIn September 2008, CRSP finally located a space in which to house the biodiesel\nprocessor, and requiring little renovation- the same site the team had proposed 2\nyears earlier. NW14, the Francis Bitter Magnet Lab has a multipurpose room with\nwater, electricity, load dock access and meets MIT Environmental Health and\nSafety specification, making it a perfect place for the biodiesel processor.\nUnfortunately, the space was inhabited by a Course XII EAPS - Earth,\nAtmospheric and Planetary Sciences graduate student doing dissertation\nresearch. The push from Biodiesel, Barnowski said, pushed the student to finish\nfaster. The project team renewed their purchase order and planned to move in\nOctober 2008 when the minor renovations would be complete.\nThe teams final preparatory work focused on synchronizing the Student Activities\noffice, Campus Dining, and the Grounds Department (in Facilities) to get used\nvegetable oil transported to NW14.\nSeptember 2009\nAfter 2 years of space frustration, with public dissolution of club in university\nmedia, CRSP and Facilities finally found space for a processor - the same site the\n\nBiodiesel@MIT, a teaching note\nS. Silbey\nstudents had proposed 2 years earlier - and after 1 yr of renovation and reactor\ninstallation/testing, fuel is finally being produced.\nThe team succeeded in making its first batch of biodiesel fuel in August, 30\ngallons of slightly cloudy, golden-colored fuel. In September, they finished a\nsecond batch. \"Before the fuel can actually be poured into the tank of a shuttle\nbus, though, it has to be tested under standards set by ASTM International\n(originally known as the American Society for Testing and Materials),\nan independent safety standards and testing organization, to assure that it's free\nof contaminants and has the correct \"flash point\" for ignition. \"If it passes that,\"\nsays Biodiesel@MIT vice president Kyle Gilpin, a graduate student in EECS,\n\"then we will pass it off to facilities to use in their equipment.\"13 The initial\nbatches were used for lawn mowing equipment, with later batches passing tests\nfor 20% biodiesel to supply the campus shuttles.\nQuestions for class discussion:\n(1)A campus student movement succeeds after several years in getting MIT\nPresident, Susan Hockfield, to commit to reduce MIT carbon footprint but\nonly after other major universities also signed on. Turning waste oil from\ndining facilities into fuel took 5 years. Why it did it take so long? Does this\nproject fit with MIT values? What are these? Why did the project need\nreframing to fit better with MIT values? If MIT is an energy leader, why not\nan environmental leader?\n(2) Can the story be seen as three years of frustrating but nonetheless\nincremental movement?\n(3) How is this effort positioned, and not positioned, within recognized\nuniversity categories?That is, within labs, departments, chains of\ncommand, etc.? What more would you need to know to answer this\nquestion?\n(4) How did biodiesel@MIT work within the bureaucratic hierarchy? How did\nthe team handle the complexity of a 20,000 person organization? Who\nhad the power to make the decisions to move ahead? Where were the\nincentives and who would benefit?\n(5) How does change take place?\n13 \"Used frying oil to power MIT Shuttles,\" physorg.com, 23 September, 2009.\nwww.physorg.com/news172920458.html.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.031J / 14.43J / 21A.341J / 11.161J Energy Decisions, Markets, and Policies\nSpring 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "15.031J\n\nSpring, 2011\n\nClean Coal/ Dirty Air/ Trading Filth (A)1\n\nA few months after the first Earth Day, April 22, 1970, Congress passed and President\nNixon signed the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, which, for the first time, gave the federal\ngovernment a major role in controlling air pollution. This case is concerned with how the federal\ngovernment dealt with the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from coal-fired electric generating\nstations.\nThe 1970 Act and the EPA\n\nBefore 1970, environmental protection was principally a matter for the states, rather than\nthe federal government. Environmentalists argued that the typical state agency was badly\nunderstaffed and lacked sufficient expertise, so that it could not even pretend to understand the\nenvironment it was trying to regulate. Moreover, even though state agencies frequently took the\nform of independent commissions, not under the governor's direct control, their membership was\noften dominated by the very interests that had most to gain from pollution. (State public utility\ncommissions were among the first agencies created on this model, intended to be expert and\nabove politics.)\n\nIn response to this perception, the 1970 Act placed primary responsibility on a single\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator situated within the executive branch. It\nrequired the Administrator to set quantitative clean air targets that would \"protect the public\nhealth\" while allowing for an \"adequate margin of safety\" and to reach these targets by 1977 at\nthe latest. These National Ambient Air Quality Standards or NAAQS are periodically revised in\nlight of new information.\n\nOnce having set air quality targets, the next step was to define the best means of\nachieving the clean air targets by 1977. As far as existing power plants were concerned,\nCongress required that state-level administrators develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs).\nThe binding federal constraint was that, taken together, polluters within each airshed had to\nreduce emissions sufficiently to bring local conditions into compliance with the NAAQSs.\nBecause different airsheds had different air quality and contain different polluters with different\ncleanup costs, various SIPs required old plants to reduce their SO2 discharges by widely varying\namounts.\n\nSo far as new power plants are concerned, the Act's provisions for new source\nperformance standards (NSPS) required all plants of the same type, regardless of their location,\nto meet the same emission ceiling for each pollutant. The EPA Administrator was required by\nsection 111 to set emissions standards that could be satisfied by the \"best system of emission\nreduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction) the Administrator\ndetermines has been adequately demonstrated.\"\n\n1 This case was prepared for classroom use in the MIT subject \"Energy Decisions, Markets, and Policies.\" It is\nlargely based on and contains extensive material from Bruce A. Ackerman and William T. Hassler, \"Beyond the\nNew Deal: Coal and the Clean Air Act,\" Yale Law Journal, Vol. 89, No. 8 (July 1980), pp. 1466-1571. Please do\nnot cite, quote, or copy any of this document.\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2011\n\nThis insistence on better performance from new plants makes some sense. Old plants,\nafter all, had often been designed with little or no thought to pollution control. New limitations\nwould often require expensive retrofitting, and the costs of retrofitting might vary enormously\nfrom plant to plant. In contrast, new plants could be designed from the start to take pollution\nreduction into account. But by lifting the NSPS process out of the general effort to tailor cutback\nrequirements for existing plants to local environmental goals, the Act made it easier for\npolicymakers to tighten NSPSs without regard to environmental benefits.\nThe 1971 NSPS Decision\n\nIn deciding on an NSPS for coal-fired powerplants in 1971, the EPA had to deal with a\npair of ambiguous features of the Act. First, there is the instruction that the Administrator take\ncost \"into account\" in making his decision. Does the Act require contemplation of cost figures in\nthe abstract, or does it allow an assessment of the net costs generated by a control system after its\nenvironmental benefits have been taken into consideration? Second, a proposed system must be\n\"adequately demonstrated\" before it becomes the basis for a cleanup requirement. This phrase\nsuggests that the EPA could have relied on new cleanup technologies that had been\n\"demonstrated\" in pilot plants and taken the risk that they might fail to work effectively when\ndeployed at scale, or it could have satisfied itself with well-established technologies that had\nalready been deployed at scale, and thereby lessened incentives to innovate. But could it set a\nschedule of increasingly tough requirements over an extended period to stimulate innovation?\n\nIn any case, the agency did not address these questions. Instead, it read the language in\nsection 111 as if a standard could be established on the basis of a narrow engineering judgment.\nIn the early 1970s there existed two methods for reducing SO2 emissions from coal-fired plants:\nphysical coal cleaning, or \"washing,\" and flue gas desulfurization, commonly known as\n\"scrubbing.\" Physical coal cleaning removes sulfur from coal before the coal is burned. Freshly-\nmined coal is crushed, passed through a screen, and wetted, so that heavy, sulfur-bearing\nfragments settle out. This inexpensive process does not remove sulfur that is chemically bonded\nto the coal, but it can remove from 20 to 40 percent of the sulfur initially present. The alternative\ntechnology, scrubbing, depended on the maintenance of a large-scale chemical reaction in a\nstructure constructed next to the powerplant that requires continuous on-site supervision.\nAlthough the early scrubbers available in 1971 (only 3 were in operation) removed about 75\npercent of the SO2 in flue gases, they were prone to frequent breakdowns.\n\nThus the EPA squarely faced the problem of how to trade off certainty and economy\nagainst incentives for further technological development. Rather than dealing directly with this\nproblem, the agency focused its attention on the question whether the scrubber was practically\navailable in some engineering sense, that is, whether scrubbers could be made operational in the\nnear future. On the basis of this work, the Administrator determined that the capacity of\nscrubbers to eliminate about 70 percent of a coal-burner's sulfur oxides had been adequately\ndemonstrated and proceeded to the task of translating this engineering judgment into regulatory\npolicy.\n\nAt this point the agency had to confront the fact that before the Administrator could tell\nthe industry how many pounds of SO2 a plant could emit for each million BTU (MBTU) of\nenergy it produced, it had to determine the amount of sulfur originally in the coal that the plant\nburned. But America's coal reserves ranged from one to more than ten pounds in sulfur content.\nTo make matters even more difficult for the Administrator, these coals were distributed unevenly\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2011\n\nthroughout the coal-producing regions. Roughly half of the nation's reserves lay west of the\nMississippi in the Northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions, and consisted largely of\nlow sulfur coal. Eastern reserves primarily from the Midwest and the Appalachians-contained\nmuch higher proportions of higher sulfur coal.\n\nIt is not possible to multiply a constant percentage removal by a variable initial sulfur\ncontent to yield a single nationwide numerical ceiling on power plant emissions. Moreover,\nalthough the statute directed the Administrator to look at the \"best system\" in defining applicable\nemissions standards, it did not authorize him to force polluters actually to install that system if\nthey could meet the limit in some other way. Thus, whatever ceiling the Administrator might\nset, polluters might find it cheaper simply to burn low sulfur coal than to install scrubbers. The\nthreat of a massive shift to lower sulfur coal would, in turn, generate significant losses for and\nthus powerful political pressures from the Eastern producers of high sulfur coal.\n\nIn its initial 1971 decision, the agency simply announced a ceiling and made a few casual\nremarks in its support. The numerical ceiling for emissions was set at 1.2 pounds of SO2 per\nMBTU. In support, it was simply stated that this ceiling would permit Eastern plants to scrub the\naverage coal, which was said to contain about 4 pounds of sulfur per MBTU ([1 - 0.70] X 4 lb =\n1.2 lb). At the same time, the agency recognized that utilities might respond to this ceiling by\nburning 1.2 pound coal rather than burning coal with more sulfur and installing a scrubber. The\nregulation simply stated that burning low sulfur coal could be used to satisfy the new standard.\n\nTo be clear, it was not as though EPA devoted much attention to the New Source\nPerformance Standard (NSPS). In 1971, it was an infant agency confronting a clear\ncongressional deadline requiring it to reach specified clean air targets by 1977. If the EPA were\nto reach these targets, its prime problem was to get the states to induce existing polluters to cut\nback on existing pollution, not to plan for new plants that would come on line in 1980 or 1990.\n\nWhen the 1.2 pound standard was appealed by the utility industry2, the District of\nColumbia Circuit court found that EPA had failed to take account of the sludge generated by a\ntypical scrubbing operation. The standard was remanded to the EPA with the instruction that it\nconsider this solid waste problem. However, the agency merely re-promulgated its original\nNSPS standard, this time declaring explicitly that it had taken sludge into account.\nInfluencing the Next Agenda\n\nSoon after the 1971 NSPS was announced, one chapter of the Navajo tribe sued EPA,\ncontending that the standard did not adequately control the complex of massive coal-burning\nfacilities located near Four Corners, Arizona. Because low sulfur coal was readily available in\nthe Southwest, the plants would be able to meet the 1.2 pound standard without scrubbing. The\nNavajo tribes argued that the EPA should nonetheless require the plants to install scrubbers.\n\nIf scrubbing were generally required, Southwestern power plants would nonetheless use\nWestern low sulfur coal because, taking into account shipping costs, it was by far the cheapest\ncoal available. But in the East and Midwest, many plants would have a choice between nearby\n\n2 The Administrative Procedures Act, passed in 1946, empowers federal courts to invalidate any federal regulation if\nit is found to be \"arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\" The\nClean Air Act also requires reversal of a decision that is found to be \"in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or\nlimitations, or short of statutory right.\" Major environmental regulations are almost always challenged in court by\none or more interest groups, sometimes for opposite reasons.\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2011\n\nhigh sulfur coal and more distant low sulfur varieties. If the emissions ceiling remained at 1.2\nand scrubbing were also required, these utilities would lose all economic incentive to pay the\ncosts of shipping low sulfur coal. Instead, they would use their percent scrubbers on the high-\nsulfur coal available nearby. The Navajo suit was highly visible but ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nOther highly visible battles concerned emissions from existing coal-fired plants. If the\nAct's NAAQS were to be met, many of these plants would have to cut their emissions\nsubstantially, but under the law, each plant's lawful emissions could be determined only after a\nstate agency had calculated the cutback required to assure regional compliance with the ambient\nstandards for SO2. Those calculations could be challenged in court.\n\nMoreover, utilities, predictably, tried to minimize the cost of the changes required of\nthem. Instead of building scrubbers or burning low sulfur coal, they proposed to reduce their\neffective contributions to the local sulfur oxide problems by building \"tall stacks,\" up to 1000\nfeet high. And to respond to the temporarily higher SO2 concentrations created by inversions or\nother unfavorable meteorological conditions, the utilities proposed an \"intermittent control\nstrategy.\" They would hold a reserve of low sulfur fuels to burn during inversions or bring their\ncleanest plants on line first.\n\nEnvironmentalists argued that tall stacks would improve local conditions only at the\nexpense of more distant regions. They also opposed \"intermittent controls,\" which imposed\nsignificant burdens on future efforts to monitor compliance. Environmental groups brought suit\nto challenge the legality of the utilities' strategies under the Clean Air Act and came to\nemphasize mandatory scrubbing as their preferred remedy for utility foot-dragging, while the\nutilities insisted that scrubbers were unreliable. The scrubber \"solution\" was thus present in the\nminds of policymakers when the NSPS was again considered.\nThe 1976 Maneuvers\n\nBy 1976, most areas of the nation rarely experienced violations of the NAAQS for SO2.\nBut Congress did not ask whether the SO2 emissions standard needed to be changed. And the\ntreatment of new coal-burning plants did not emerge directly upon the legislative agenda.\nInstead, it emerged as an issue as congressional staffers grappled with a far more pressing issue:\nthe treatment of the \"clean air regions.\"\n\nAlthough the 1970 Act had established minimum air quality objectives for the nation,\nmany areas in the nation already enjoyed air far cleaner than the Act required. The 1970 Law\ndid not clearly address these areas. In these areas, did the 1970 Act allow pollution up to the\nminimum standards? When EPA began to approve SIP's that permitted power plants to degrade\nclean air regions, the Sierra Club challenged the legality of this decision, and it won in court.\n\nThus unless Congress amended the Act, the EPA could not approve state plans which\npermitted increases in the levels of pollutants in clean air areas. This would have been a serious\nobstacle to Western economic development. House staffers working under Congressmen who\nsupported the protection of clean air areas turned to the solution advanced by the Navajos: a\nscrubbing requirement for all new plants. Even if the Act was amended to allow the EPA to\npermit pollution to increase in clean air areas, requiring all new coal-burners to scrub would at\nleast provide some protection to clean air regions.\n\nAs noted above, the 1970 version of section 111 directed the Administrator to set\nperformance standards that reflected \"the degree of emission limitation achievable through the\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2011\n\napplication of the best system of emission reduction.\" The 1976 House committee proposal\nrequired a standard that \"reflects the degree of emission reduction achievable through the\napplication of the best technological system of continuous emission reduction.\" On its face this\nlanguage would also seem to permit reliance on low-sulfur coal to control emissions. The House\ncommittee report, however, explicitly stated that scrubbing or some other \"add-on\" technology\nwould be required of all new coal-burners.\n\nEastern coal interests were predictably receptive this \"new\" NSPS proposal. If Eastern\nutilities were forced to install scrubbers, it would be possible for them to meet the 1.2 NSPS\nwhile continuing to buy cheap high sulfur coal. It was only if utilities remained free to substitute\nlow sulfur coal for scrubbers that a shift away from high sulfur coal was even conceivable. Thus,\nit made sense for the dirty coal producers to abandon their campaign to weaken pollution\nstandards and support the costliest possible clean air solution: universal scrubbing. In so doing,\nthey abandoned their traditional alliance with utilities, who wanted to minimize the expense of\npollution control requirements.\n\nThough controversies over existing plants and clean air regions predisposed public\ninterest lawyers favorably toward the scrubber, leading environmental lawyers were aware of the\nheavy costs of imposing particular technologies on industry rather than permitting them to search\nout the cheapest way of meeting emission requirements. Rather than explicitly campaigning for\nsimply reducing the 1971 emissions standard, however, public interest lawyers embraced the\ndirty coal rhetoric. For example, Joseph Brecher, on behalf of the Sierra Club, condemned the\n1971 standard because \"eastern high sulfur coal, which is now available, is having a hard time\ngetting a market because of the comparative cheapness of bringing in western low sulfur coal.\"\nThis was unusual because environmentalists typically do not protest when a government\ninitiative forces industry to discard \"dirty\" inputs and substitute \"clean\" ones.\n\nThroughout the subsequent 1976 legislative process the partisans of scrubbing had no\nincentive to enlarge the debate on this issue. And because the utility industry concentrated its\nassault against protection for \"clean air\" areas, no significant lobby invested resources in\ndocumenting the shaky relationship between universal scrubbing and any of the aims that\nCongress was considering. Revision in the language of section 111 via rarely examined\ncommittee report language passed through the House untouched, and the Senate committee saw\nno need to include any revision of section 111 in its proposals. The House amendment to section\n111--with its report language--was included in the bill that emerged from conference. At that\npoint, however, the conference measure encountered determined opposition from Western\nindustry and automakers and, in response to a threatened filibuster, the controversy was shelved\nuntil the following session.\nThe 1977 Amendments\n\nIn 1977, a new Congress and a new President still faced the need to amend the Clean Air\nAct. But the \"energy crisis\" had replaced the \"environmental crisis\" as the central problem on\nPresident Carter's domestic agenda. Independence from foreign oil in electricity generation\ncould be purchased only by burning more domestic coal. Yet, to make coal burning politically\nacceptable, the administration would have to deal with environmental anxieties. Recent\ncongressional history suggested that promoting scrubbing would be an easy way to convert a\ndangerous opponent into a formidable ally.\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2011\n\nNot that the administration was ignorant of the costs of scrubbing or the regional interests\ninvolved. But billions of dollars in costs appeared insignificant in the context of comprehensive\nenergy planning, especially when scrubbing promised great political benefits. Universal\nscrubbing was therefore attached, as an environmental safeguard, to the steps in the energy plan\nthat were intended to encourage utilities to increase their use of coal. Because scrubbing was\nnow part of the administration's comprehensive energy plan, it was no longer appropriate for the\nEPA, or anybody else in the executive, to ask hard questions about the relationship of scrubbing\nto any of the environmental goals before Congress as it prepared 1977 clean air legislation.\n\nIn 1977 the House-passed bill contained the 1976 version of section 111 and the\naccompanying report language, but the Senate bill proposed no change in section 111. The\nconference committee was mainly concerned with other issues, so the fate of section 111 was\nmainly in the hands of staff. Senate staffers generally opposed scrubbing and added a new\nsubsection stating that unless it is \"not feasible\" to permit polluters to choose, the Administrator\nmay not require a particular \"design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard.\" But\nHouse staffers inserted language to the effect that although the Administrator was to set an\nemission limit, an acceptable power plant standard also had to require\nthe achievement of a percentage reduction in the emissions from such category of sources\nfrom the emissions which would have resulted from the use of fuels which are not subject\nto treatment prior to combustion.\nThat is, the Administrator must not only require a power plant to discharge no more than X\npounds of sulfur oxide per MBTU, but also to reduce the sulfur in the coal by Y percent. By\nsetting the percentage reduction requirement at a level only scrubbers could achieve, the\nAdministrator could force all coal-burners to install scrubbers. But the Administrator could set Y\n= 0, since he or she also had to consider \"the cost of achieving ... emission reduction[s]\" before\nrequiring the use of the \"best technological system.\"\n\nHouse and Senate staff inserted additional provisions in the conference report alternately\nfavoring and disfavoring compulsory scrubbing. Taken together with the law itself, as passed in\nAugust, 1977, the result was a document whose legal meaning was hopelessly confused.\nThe EPA Takes Action\n\nEPA was internally divided on how to proceed. The Office of Planning and Management\nwhich viewed forced scrubbing as a pure waste, while the Office of Air, Noise, and Radiation\nfelt that it was wrong for an administrative agency to deny political activists (in this case the\nclean air-dirty coal lobby) the fruits of their congressional victory. Because the EPA was in the\nExecutive Branch, White House would have to approve the new NSPS, and the Department of\nEnergy (DOE) could argue against full scrubbing to the White House.\n\nIn the fall of 1977, the Air Office circulated a proposed NSPS that would leave the 1.2\npound ceiling in place but require full scrubbing - i.e., 90 percent removal. Using a consulting\nfirm's detailed computer model of coal supply and electricity production, alternative possible\nrules were examined by analysts in EPA and DOE. By January 1979, the Planning Office had\ncome to favor a simple proposal that would tolerate some increases in SO2 in the West, where\nthere was no SO2 problem, while reducing Eastern loads more significantly. Simply reducing the\nold 1.2 emission ceiling to 0.55 would force everyone to scrub somewhat since no coal could\npass the lower ceiling without advanced technology. Costs would nonetheless be hundreds of\n\n15.031J\n\nSpring, 2011\n\nmillions of dollars lower than with full 90 percent scrubbing so long as polluters were allowed to\ndecide for themselves how to mix lower sulfur coal and higher scrubbing percentages to reach\nthe 0.55 ceiling. Moreover, the simple proposal to lower the ceiling to 0.55 promised lower SO2\nemissions nationwide, as well as significant emission reductions in the areas east of the\nMississippi where the health threat was most serious.\n\nIn 1978 the President had issued an Executive Order requiring agencies to conduct an\n\"economic impact analysis\" for every \"significant\" regulation and established the Regulatory\nAnalysis Review Group (RARG), a group of economists whose job it was to review the analysis\ngenerated by the front-line agency. Just as the EPA had not addressed the benefit of tightening\nthe NSPS, neither did the RARG. In January, 1979, after extensive modeling analysis, the\nRARG came out in favor of the Planning Office proposal to lower the ceiling from 1.2 to some\nlower number and to permit utilities to mix scrubbing and low sulfur coal in the way that would\nmost cheaply meet the ceiling.\n\nBut so far as Eastern coal interests were concerned, lowering the emission ceiling to 0.55\nwould deprive them of their hard fought victory in Congress. Such a low ceiling would make it\nimpossible to scrub the higher sulfur Eastern varieties into compliance. But this time\nenvironmentalists were not their allies. Although they preferred to go further and require full\nscrubbing in the West, they counted the proposed reduction in the emission ceiling as a victory.\nReducing the ceiling from 1.2 to 0.55 would raise electric utilities' costs, however, and the\nutilities were happy to join forces with their former Eastern mining allies in opposing the 0.55\nproposal.\n\nPolitical pressure from utilities and Eastern coal interests pushed the Administrator back\nto the initial Air Office proposal, universal 90 percent scrubbing under a 1.2 ceiling. But within\nthe agency, a full scrubbing decision under external political pressure would demoralize the\nPlanning Office. Outside the agency, the DOE remained adamantly opposed to full scrubbing,\nand the technocrats in the Executive Office would defend its RARG report.\n\nA new technology, dry scrubbing, offered a way out of the box in the spring of 1979.\nAlthough no dry scrubbers were in operation in the U.S. at the time, a research report indicated\nthat dry scrubbing could operate considerably more cheaply than wet scrubbing if it were not\nrequired to eliminate more than 70 percent of a coal's sulfur content. Attention within EPA then\nturned to a two-tier proposal: 70 percent scrubbing would be allowed on the condition that the\nplant met a 0.6 ceiling; otherwise the ceiling would be 1.2 and 90 percent scrubbing would be\nrequired. The computer model said that the costs of this proposal were nearly as low as the\nsimple 0.55 ceiling and that it would yield lower SO2 emissions.\n\nWhile the DOE still remained opposed to any scrubbing on the grounds that it was\nexcessively costly, White House staff were pleased, and the two-tier proposal became the new\nNSPS. The Sierra Club challenged this standard in court, but in 1981 the Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia held that EPA had not exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the\nNSPS, and the court declined to set it aside.3\n\n3 Sierra Club v.

      "content": "Derived Demand and Capital vs. Current Cost Considerations\nRecitation 5\nPractice Questions\n\n1. Jimmy B has been forced to move from Key West to Boston, but he still likes to keep\nhis house warm. His demand curve for interior temperature in °F, T, is T = 100 - 0.5C,\nwhere C is the cost of heat in $ per degree. If heat were free, he would keep his house at\n100°. Luckily, he has a very rare linear furnace, so that T = G/4, where G is the amount\nof gas he burns per month in million cubic feet (MCF). Let P be the price of gas in dollars\nper MCF.\na. Derive Jimmy's demand for gas as a function of its price.\nb. If the price of gas is $12/MCF, how much gas does Jimmy burn, and how\nwarm is his house?\nc. What is the elasticity of demand for heat with respect to its price at this point?\nd. What is the elasticity of demand for gas with respect to its cost at this point?\n\n2. You are the CFO of UtilityCo, a national utility company that constructs and operates\nelectrical power plants. You recently won a tender to construct and operate a new power\nplant in Energyville and now must decide what sort of plant to construct. The table below\noutlines your options.\n\nNotes:\n1. Assume opportunity cost of capital/discount rate of 10%\n2. Indicates recurring costs that are likely to rise in line with inflation (assume inflation to be 2.5% throughout the life\nof the project)\n3. Construction will take 1 year and the plant will be operated for 30 years\n4. Maintenance Costs reflect a reoccurring cost, contracted in advance, to be paid after every 12 months of operation.\nDue to your great negotiation skills these costs are fixed for the life of the plant\n5. The city has mandated that you pay for the reclamation of the land used for the plant. Following the plant's closure\nyou will be required to pay the lump sum indicated to get the land back into its original state before leaving (assumed to\ntake 1 full year to complete)\n\na. What is the total cost of each of the options indicated above? Assuming the\nCitizens of Energyville refuse to pay more for clean energy, which option will\nyou choose?\nb. A new mayor has just been elected and has decided to impose a tax to curb carbon\nemissions. You calculate your estimated carbon tax cost to be $20mm per year for\nCoal and $10mm for Natural Gas. You have also discovered that plants in the\nregion will pay to offset their costs and can potentially receive a benefit of $5mm\n\nper year for the Wind and Solar plants. What are the new costs of construction\nand operating the plants, assuming these tax costs and potential benefits will rise\nwith inflation? Does this change your answer to question a? In your response,\nplease also discuss any operating assumptions or potential risks that may affect\nthe residents of Energyville of the value of the energy generated by the various\noptions.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.031J / 14.43J / 21A.341J / 11.161J Energy Decisions, Markets, and Policies\nSpring 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Derived Demand:\nT = 100 - 0.5C where C = cost of heat in $/°F\nT = G/4 where G = amount of gas burned per month in MCF\nP = price of gas in $/MCF\na. Derived demand for gas as a function of price.\nT = 100 - 0.5C = G/4 demand for temperature\nG = 400 - 2C demand for gas as a function of the cost of heat\nG* = 4T\nC* = (PG)/T = 4P $/°F\nG = 400 - 2(PG/T)\nG = 400 - 2(PG)/(G/4)\nG = 400 - 8P demand for gas as a function of the price of gas\nb. If P = $12/MCF, how much does he burn and how warm is his house?\nG = 400 - 8P = 400 - 8(12) = 304 MCF/month\nT = 100 - 2P = 100 - 24 = 76°F\nc. Elasticity of demand for heat with respect to its price at this point.\nP = 12 $/MCF, T = 76°F\nC = 4P = 48 $/°F\nT = 100 - 0.5C => dT/dC = -0.5\n(dT/T)/(dC/C) = (C/T)*(dT/dC) = (48/76)*(-0.5) = -0.3158\nd. Elasticity of demand for gas with respect to its cost at this point.\nP = 12 $/MCF, G = 304 MCF/month\nG = 400 - 8P => dG/dP = -8\n(dG/G)/(dP/P) = (P/G)*(dG/dP) = (12/304)*(-8) = -0.3158\n\n2. Capital vs. Current Cost Considerations:\na. Total cost of each option and which option would the CFO of UtilityCo\nchoose?\nThe table below shows the resulting present value costs of each type of plant.\nSee the Excel spreadsheet for the details of the costs incurred each year for\neach of the options. Assuming that the Citizens of Energyville refuse to pay\nmore for clean energy, the CFO of UtilityCo should choose the cheapest one to\nconstruct and operate, meaning the coal power plant as shown by the numbers\nbelow.\nPlant Type\nCoal\nNatural Gas\nWind\nSolar\nTotal Cost\n$314,070,129.66\n$362,256,873.95\n$451,360,920.80\n$463,202,566.80\nb. Carbon tax = $20M per year, Natural gas tax = $10M per year. Benefit of\n$5M per year for Wind and Solar plants. Taxes and Benefits will rise with\ninflation. Does the answer for part a change? Discuss operating\nassumptions or potential risks that may affect the residents of\nEnergyville.\nAdding the taxes and benefits, changes the answer to part a (see the Excel\nspreadsheet). In fact, the taxes on coal and natural gas plants lead to very high\ntotal costs for those two options. Instead, the benefits for wind and solar plants,\nmake these options the cheapest. In this case, the CFO should choose the\nwind power plant seeing as it has the lowest total cost of construction and\noperation.\nPlant Type\nCoal\nNatural Gas\nWind\nSolar\nTotal Cost\n$554,546,455.66\n$482,495,036.95\n$391,241,839.30\n$403,083,485.30\nIt is important to note that the benefit received for the wind and solar plants is a\n\"potential\" benefit. Thus there is a risk that this benefit will not actually be\nreceived or that it might not last for the entire lifecycle of the plant, making the\nwind and solar power plants as expensive as they were in part a. In addition,\nwe must keep in mind that the newly elected mayor is the one to have imposed\nthe taxes on coal and natural gas. The mayor however, will most likely not be in\noffice for the entire 30 years of the plantʼs operation, meaning that a new mayor\ncould lower or even remove these taxes. As a result, the cost of the coal and\nnatural gas plants might go down to a cost similar to the original cost in part a.\nFinally, the current calculations do not take into account anything going wrong\nin any of the plants. Some problem or incident might greatly increase the\nmaintenance costs, further affecting the differences in total cost of the plants.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.031J / 14.43J / 21A.341J / 11.161J Energy Decisions, Markets, and Policies\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Once an agency is \"depoliticized\" or\n\"made independent\" by handing it over to its organized clientele, the number of \"factions\" is reduced from a competitive\nto an oligopolistic situation\nSocial Movements\n\nHow they come about and differ from interest groups & political parties\n\nHow they influence markets and policy\n\nU.S. Environmental Regulation\n\nEPA Regulation\n\nUS Clean Air act of 1970\n\nTreatment of new and old sources\n\nImplications\n\n1990 Acid Rain Program\n\nWhy it was enacted\n\nImplications\n\nEconomic Analysis\n-\nIncentive to prolong the life of old sources\n-\nVariation in clean-up costs and cost of standard setting - Clean areas resisted scrubbing, national electricity tax and\nDirty areas resisted cleanup\n-\nNational cap-and-trade (\"allowance trading\")\n\nOther environs held their noses; no alternative way forward\n\nAllowance allocations were used to build a coalition\n\nSmall part of big clean air bill\n\nOnce passage seemed likely, wild scramble for allowances\n-\nTook effect in 1995, on schedule, and Acid Rain declined\n\nNot a great surprise when you think about it;\nshort-run demand inelastic, supply perfectly\ninelastic, but bothers both industry and environs.\nA tax would have given price stability but\nquantity risk (environs hated) and greater\nburden on utilities (they hated)\nEconomic Analysis\nCap and Trade\nTaxation\n\nThe 1990 Acid Rain Program\n\nPrice\nCap\nScarcity Rent\nCost\nBAU\nEmissions\nMarginal Cost of Abatement\nNote: Marginal Cost curve is Demand for\nAllowances curve, normalized to 100 at Price = 0\nMillion tons SO2\nThe Cap\nSO2 Emissions\nCounterfactuals\n-\nStandards always have an incentive to cut, no\nmatter how clean\n-\nProduced considerable innovation: e.g., coal\nblending, cheap scrubbers\n-\nSO2 prices moved more than some expected\nSource: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. \"Acid Rain Report: 2003 Progress Report.\" September 2004.\n\nFinal Papers\n10 minutes per team\nFormat: 5-6 minutes presentation (max. 3 slides),\nthen 4-5 minutes to answer questions\n2 people to present, other 2 to take questions\nOther Questions?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.031J / 14.43J / 21A.341J / 11.161J Energy Decisions, Markets, and Policies\nSpring 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
