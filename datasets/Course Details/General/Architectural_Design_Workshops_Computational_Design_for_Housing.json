No background in computing is required. Limited to 8 students.\n\nDescription\n\nAn intensive nine day remote collaborative workshop involving MIT and Miyagi University in Japan. The objective is to develop a small housing project using shape computation as a design methodology. Students will use and test new interactive software for designing, sharing applications with overseas partners, presenting projects on an Internet workspace, and critiquing design proposals through the web and other advanced digital technologies. Students will be expected to do most of their work in class.\n\nFormat\n\nHands-on workshop. After short introductory lectures, students will work on design proposals directly in the classroom. Work-in-progress will be uploaded regularly to the class web-site to share and collaborate on design proposals.\n\nCollaboration Model\n\nStudents will work in teams of four - i.e. two MIT students with two Miyagi students. During classroom work, students will have access to remote collaborative software for discussing their proposals with their overseas team members. In different stages of design, students will consult with their overseas partners, and critique each other's design proposals.",

Each group can decide on how many houses\nthey want for their clusters.\nAlthough the programs for MIT and MIYAGI students are similar, units area and the\nsites are completely different: one is tight and the other one almost too large. The\ngroups are expected to take advantage of the on-line consulting with their overseas\npartners to take decisions about cultural characteristics of the American and\nJapanese houses, like the number of bathrooms in each unit or where to place the\nlaundry (even if there should be a special room for it or if it should be hidden in a\ncloset).\nTo avoid imposing too many constraints, for this short exercise we are going to ignore\nbuilding codes, but a general idea can be passed to your partners, to keep the\nprojects close to reality.\nWe will be using shape grammars to:\n1. Display the groups of houses in the site. (2D grammar)\n2. Design the groups of houses (3D grammar)\nP R O G R A M\n1.

      "content": "Shape Grammars for the 3D study of the townhouses clusters\nI. Given proportions\nWe are going to give you a set of values to use in 3dshaper so that you wont\nhave to experiment with different proportions, but rather with different labelings\nfor this exercise.\nThe proportions are as follows:\nBlock 1\nBlock 2\nx\ny\nz\nRotate\nMove\n-4\nNote that Block 1 is an oblong, so you can vary its label from values 1 through\n8.\nBlock 2, instead, is a pillar, so you can vary its label from 1 through 16.\nEvery time you open a model in 3Space Assistant remember to use\nFile/Save as to store your desing in a separate file, or else 3dShaper will\nrewrite your new design on the same file and you will loose it.\nNow play around with randomly chosen labeling values and generate a few\nmodels. See if you can relate the label position with the result you get, by\n\nlooking at the rules.iv file in 3Space Assistant each time.\nII. Importing your models in the site model\n1. In 3Space Assistant, having your shape grammar model opened, choose\nfile/save as and save your model as\n.wrl 1.0 files.\n2. Download a .max version of the site model by clicking below:\nsite3d_japan.max\nsite3d_boston.max\n3a. (for MIT students only) Now open the site model in 3dStudioMax by\nchoosing file/open.\n3b. (for Japan students only) If your version of 3DStudio doens't support the\n.max file type, download the .3ds version below, and open or import it in\n3DStudio:\nsite3d_japan.3ds\nsite3d_boston.3ds\n4. To import the 3dshaper model, choose again file/import, but this time\nchoose VRML .wrl as your file type.\n5. In the VRML import dialog box uncheck all the options (reset scene, turn to\n3ds coordinates, create primitives).\n6. When the model comes in it is automatically selected and it is formed by\ndifferent separate parts that are ahrd to move around. To overcome this\ndifficulty, before clicking anywhere, go to Goup/Group and answer OK to the\nGroup dialog box that will pop up. You can edit the name of the group here, to,\nfor example, Model 1.\n7. Note that the dimensions of the model that you import from 3dshaper will\nbe scaled to 1unit=1meter, so to avoid having to rescale it in 3dMax, make\nsure to use reasonable values in meters.\n8. You can import as many different models as you wish from 3dshaper into this\n3dmax file. Remember to always turn them into groups as you import them.\n9. To turn them on and off go to the top of the right side panel and click on the\nDisplay tab. With the arrow cursor click on the model you want to hide and\nthen in the right side panel click on the Hide Selected button. To bring an\nobject back, simply click on the Unhide by Name button and click on the\nname(s) of the object(s) you want to see in your screen.\n\n10. Now arrange your models on the site by using the buttons to select\n,\nmove\n, scale\nand rotate\n. Note that to do movements in different\nplans you just have to click on the screen of the desired plan.\n11. To arrange your view in 3dStudioMax use the icons menu in the lower right\ncorner of the screen. If you leave your cursor on top of each button it will tell\nyou what the button does.\nNote that the icon for zoom to window changes to a perspective view if your\ncursor is in the Perspective window. To make the image larger in that window\nsimply select the perspective tool, click on the left mouse button and drag it up\nto get closer or down to get farther.\n12. To change colors of the objects click on the Materials menu icon\nin the\ntop tool bar to open the Materials Editor:\n\nFrom there, click on the desired material, drag and drop on top of the object\nyou want to change the color. If some parts of your model are missing, try\nchecking on the 2dsided box of the material you chose.\n13. Finally, to turn this model into an image, first click on the view you want to\nrender and then click on the Render menu icon\nin the top tool bar, to open\nthe Render Scene window:\n\nFrom the Render Scene window, select the resolution you want to render and\nthen on the Render button. In the rendered view, click on the disk button to\nsave your image. Make sure that the Viewport field in the bottom of the\nwindow displays the name of the view you want to render (e.g. Perspective).\nN O T E S :\nAlso, remember to review the Pin up 2 instructions to prepare your 4 400 wide\nby 600 high images (see Calendar, Session 5 - Pin Up 2 Directions for extra\ndetails).\nGood luck!"
