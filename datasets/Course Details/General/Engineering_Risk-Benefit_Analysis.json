All of these pertain to decision making in the presence of significant uncertainty. In ERBA, the issues of interest are: The risks associated with large engineering projects such as nuclear power reactors, the International Space Station, and critical infrastructures; the development of new products; the design of processes and operations with environmental externalities; and infrastructure renewal projects.\n\nAs part of RPRA, we will review elementary probability theory and statistics. This review will be helpful not only for this course but also other courses in the SDM (System Design and Management) program, such as 15.761, Operations Management, and ESD.33J, Systems Engineering.\n\nERBA presents and interprets some of the many frameworks helpful for balancing risks and benefits in these situations that typically involve human safety, potential environmental effects, and large financial and technological uncertainties. Although ERBA is applications-oriented, we want to help you develop a critical understanding of the assumptions, consequences, and practical limitations of the tools we present. We also provide perspective on the use of formal analysis in public decisions. Most students in ERBA are taking it to obtain some knowledge and experience on important topics that are not otherwise part of their academic programs.\n\nTexts\n\nThere is no textbook for this course. The ESD.72J course reader, an adaptation of the study manual for the 1978 MIT Video Lecture Course \"Decision Analysis\" by Alvin Drake & Ralph Keeney, will be photocopied and available for the DA unit.\n\nSome references that may be useful as background material are:\n\nRPRA\n\nHoyland, Arnljot, and Rausand, Marvin.\nSystem Reliability Theory\n.

These sessions are\nprimarily for the benefit of the SDM students\nand will be conducted by the TAs and/or Prof. Apostolakis, who will discuss example problems and answer questions.\n\nAssignments And Procedures\n\nFor ESD.72, there will be several problem sets (which will count for about 25% of the course's grade) and three quizzes (total of about 75% of the grade). There is no final examination. If you first make an effort to think things through for yourself, the TAs or the instructor responsible for the problem set will be glad to help you with homework before it is due. To help you understand what we expect of you, we shall also distribute examples of quizzes and solutions from previous semesters before each quiz.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nProblem sets\n\n25%\n\nThree quizzes\n\n75%\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nPart 1: Reliability and probabilistic risk assessment (RPRA)\n\nIntroduction\n\nRPRA1: The logic of certainty\n\nRPRA 2: Elements of probability theory\n\nRPRA 3: Probability distributions\n\nRPRA 3: Probability distributions (cont.)\n\nRPRA 4: Availability\n\nRPRA 5: Data and epistemic uncertainties; statistics\n\nRPRA 6: Probabilistic risk assessment\n\nRPRA 6: Probabilistic risk assessment (cont.)\n\nRPRA 7: Risk management\n\nGuest lecture\n\nGuest lecture\n\nRPRA quiz\n\nPart II: Decision analysis (DA)\n\nDA 1: The multistage decision model\n\nDA 2: The value of perfect information\n\nDA 3: The axioms of rational behavior\n\nDA 4: Introduction to utility\n\nDA 5: Risk aversion\n\nDA 6: Multiattribute utility theory\n\nDA7: Decision analysis and risk management\n\nGuest lecture\n\nDA quiz\n\nPart III: Cost-benefit analysis (CBA)\n\nCBA 1: Background and fundamental premises\n\nCBA 2: The time value of money\n\nCBA 3: Bases for comparison of alternatives\n\nCBA 4: Including uncertainty\n\nCBA 5: Evaluating public activities\n\nGuest lecture\n\nCBA quiz",

Background and Fundamental Premises\nBasic Premise of Cost-Benefit Analysis\n- Express all costs and benefits of a project in terms\nof dollars.\n- This may be a challenge for non-monetary costs\nand benefits in public projects.\n- Since many of these are in the future, find the\npresent value (worth).\n- Use a figure of merit, such as the Present Worth,\nto make decisions.\n- A widely used method by private and public\nentities.\n\nCBA 1. Background and Fundamental Premises\nThe Time Value of Money (CBA 2):\nCash Flows (1)\n- Compare alternative courses of action by\nconsidering the money consequences of each and\nits timing.\n- A1: Initial Investment: $32,000\nNet Annual Benefit: $9,000\n- A2: Initial Investment: $25,000\nNet Annual Benefit: $6,000\n- Planning Horizon: 10 years\n\nCBA 1. Background and Fundamental Premises\nCash Flows (2)\n- We need a decision criterion that allows for the\ndifferent value of money at different times.\n- Possible Criterion: Maximize the Net Present\nWorth (the present worth of benefits minus the\npresent worth of costs).\n- Other criteria have also been proposed.\n- We need methods for calculating the worth of\nmoney at different times.\n- CBA 3 will present decision criteria.\n\nCBA 1. Background and Fundamental Premises\nEvaluation Under Uncertainty (CBA 4)\n- What if costs and benefits are uncertain?\n- Lectures RPRA 2 & 3 will be useful here.\n- We'll discuss simple criteria for decision-\nmaking under uncertainty\n- Maximize expected net present value\n- Minimize probability of loss\n\nCBA 1. Background and Fundamental Premises\nEvaluating Public Activities (CBA 5)\n- National:\nInterstate highway system; Major\nwater-resource projects.\n- State:\nEducational programs\n- Municipality:\nParks; Fire protection\n- The selection is not made on the basis of profit,\nbut, rather, on the basis of maximization of the\ngeneral (or, social) welfare of the citizens.\n\nCBA 1. Background and Fundamental Premises\nRegulatory Analysis (10 CFR 50.109)\n-\nA backfit in nuclear plants is justified only if\nthere is substantial increase in the overall\nprotection of the public health and safety.\n-\nThe analysis should include:\n3⁄4\nThe potential change in the risk to the public.\n3⁄4\nThe potential impact on facility employees.\n3⁄4\nInstallation and continuing costs associated with the\nbackfit.\n3⁄4\nThe estimated resource burden on the Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission."

In most cases\nthere is no satisfactory way to combine the utility\nfunction of several people\n- As with all formal analysis, the results are no better\nthan the quality of the model and its supporting\nassessments\n- The required inputs may not be easily obtainable\n\nDA 1. The Multistage Decision Model\nManufacturing Example\n- Decision:\nTo continue producing old product (O)\nor convert to a new product (N).\nThe payoffs depend on the market conditions:\ns:\nstrong market for the new product\nm: mild market for the new product\nw: weak market for the new product\n\nDA 1. The Multistage Decision Model\nManufacturing Example Payoffs\n-\nEarnings (payoffs):\nL1: $150,000, old product,\nP[L1/O] = 1.0\nL2: $300,000, new product and the market is\nstrong,\nP[s] = P[L2/N] = 0.3\nL3: $100,000, new product and the market is mild,\nP[m] = P[L3/N] = 0.5\nL4: -$100,000, new product and the market is weak,\nP[w] = P[L4/N] = 0.2\n\nDA 1.

Apostolakis\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nSpring 2007\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nThe Importance of Time\n- A dollar in hand now is worth more than a dollar\nreceived in the future, because of its earning power,\ni.e., it can be invested to generate income.\n- The purchasing power of money, i.e., the amount of\ngoods that a certain amount can buy, changes with\ntime also.\n- Objective: To develop methods for establishing\nthe equivalence of sums of money. It depends on the\namounts, the time of occurrence of the sums of\nmoney, and the interest rate.\n\nCBA 2.

The Time Value of Money\nSimple Interest\n- P: Principal amount\n- n: Number of interest periods\n- i:\nInterest rate\n- I:\nInterest earned\n- Interest and principal become due at the end of n.\nI = Pni\n- The interest is proportional to the length of time\nthe principal amount was borrowed.\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nCompound Interest\n- Interest is payable at the end of each interest period.\n- If the interest is not paid, the borrower is charged interest\non the total amount owed (principal plus interest).\n- Example: $1,000 is borrowed for two years at 6%\n(compounded). A single payment will be made at the end of\nthe second year.\n- Amount owed at the beginning of year 2: $1,060\n- Amount owed at the end of year 2:\n$1,060x1.06 = $1,000x(1.06)2 = $1,123.60\n- For simple interest, the amount owed at the end of year 2\nwould be: $1,000 + 1,000x2x0.06 = $1,120.00\n\nCBA 2.

The Time Value of Money\nNominal and Effective Interest Rates (1)\n- The nominal interest rate (or annual\npercentage rate) is the annual rate without\nthe effect of any compounding.\n- The effective (actual) interest rate is the\nannual rate taking into account the effect of\nany compounding during the year.\nExample:\nA credit card advertises a nominal rate of 18%\ncompounded monthly. The actual rate is, then, (18/12) = 1.5%\nper month. The effective annual rate is\n(1.015)12 - 1 = 0.1956 or 19.56%\n(if you do not pay anything each month)\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nNominal and Effective Interest Rates (2)\n- The effective interest rate i depends on the\nfrequency of compounding.\n- Example: nominal interest rate r = 10%\n- Compounded annually: i = r = 10%\n- Compounded quarterly: i = (1+0.1/4)4 -1 = 10.38%\n- Compounded monthly: i = (1+0.1/12)12 -1 = 10.471%\n- Compounded weekly: i = (1+0.1/52)52 -1 = 10.506%\n- Compounded daily: i = (1+0.1/365)365 -1 = 10.516%\n- Compounded continuously: i = e0.1 - 1 = 10.517%\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nNominal and Effective Interest Rates (3)\nIn the formulas we introduced in earlier slides, i is the\neffective interest rate for a given period and n is the\nnumber of such periods.\nExample:\nYou wish to buy a house and you can afford to\nmake a down payment of $50,000. Your monthly mortgage\npayment cannot exceed $2,000. If 30-year loans are available\nat 7.5% interest compounded monthly, what is the highest\nprice that you may consider?\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nNominal and Effective Interest Rates (4)\nSolution:\nLet's use one month as the time period. Then, n = 360\nmonths, and i = (7.5/12) = 0.625%. We know that\nThis yields (A/P, 0.00625, 360) = 0.00699 ⇒\nP x 0.00699 = (H - 50,000) x 0.00699 ≤2,000\n⇒\nH ≤(2,000/0.00699) + 50,000 = $336,123\ni)\n(1\n)i\n(i\n)\nn\n,i,\nP\n/\nA\n(\nn\nn\n-\n+\n+\n=\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nNominal and Effective Interest Rates (5)\n- Let's use one year as the time period. Then, n = 30 years,\nand i = (1+0.00625)12 - 1 = 7.763%\nThen, (A*/P, 0.07763, 30) = 0.0867 A* = 0.0867P per year\nYour effective payment per year is\nA* = $2,000x(F/A, 0.00625, 12) = $2,000x12.4212 = $24,842\nP ≤(24,842/0.0867) + 50,000 = $336,533 as before\nConsistency between i and n will lead to identical solutions.\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nEconomic Equivalence (1)\n- The formulas that we have developed establish\neconomic equivalence between P and F, an equal-\npayment series and F, and so on.\nExample:\nConsider the following cash flow: You\nwill receive $500 at the end of years 3 and 4 and\n$1,000 at the end of year 5. If the interest rate is\n7%, what amount received at the present is\nequivalent to this cash flow?\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nEconomic Equivalence (2)\nSolution:\nP = 408.15 + 381.45 + 712.99 = $1,502.59\n$500\n$500\n$1,000\nP\n)\n.0\n(\n,1\n)\n.0\n(\n)\n.0\n(\nP\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nEconomic Equivalence (3)\nIf the interest is compounded continuously, the result\nwill be:\nP = 405.30 + 377.89 + 704.69 = $1,487.88\ne\ne\ne\n.0\nx\n.0\nx\n.0\nx\n,1\nP\n+\n+\n=\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nInflation\n- The purchasing power of money declines when the\nprices increase.\n- This must be included in equivalence calculations.\n- A price index is the ratio of the price of a\ncommodity or service at some point in time to the\nprice at some earlier point.\n- The Consumer Price Index (CPI) represents the\nchange in prices of a \"market basket,\" that includes\nclothing, food, utilities, and transportation.\n- The CPI measures the changes in retail prices to\nmaintain a fixed standard of living for the\n\"average\" consumer.\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nCPI and Inflation\nFrom Table 5.1 of Thuesen & Fabrycky, Engineering Economy, 7th Edition,\nPrentice Hall, NJ, 2001.\nThe\nconsumer price\nindex and\ninflation ra\nte are presen\nted i\nn fiv\ne-yea\nr inc\nremen\nts be\ntween\nand\n9.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nInflation Rate\nAnnual inflation rate for year t+1:\nFor many calculations, an average inflation rate is\nsufficient.\nCPIt(1+f)n = CPIt+n\nNote: Thuesen & Fabrycky use for the average rate.\nCPI\nCPI\nCPI\nt\nt\nt\ntf\n-\n=\n+\n+\nf\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nExample\nThe average inflation rate from 1967 to 1999 is given\nby\n100(1+f)32 = 497.6\n⇒\n1+f = 4.9761/32 = 1.0514\n⇒\nf = 5.14%\n\nCBA 2. The Time Value of Money\nDefinitions\n- Market interest rate (or current-dollar interest rate) i: The\ninterest rate available in finance. Inflation impact is\nincluded.\n- Inflation-free interest rate (or constant-dollar interest rate) i':\nIt represents the earning power of money with inflation\nremoved. It must be calculated.\n- Actual dollars:\nThe amount received or disbursed at any\npoint in time.\n- Constant dollars: The hypothetical amount received or\ndisbursed in terms of the purchasing power of dollars at\nsome base year.\n\nCBA 2.

The Value of Perfect Information\nThe value of beta\n- What is the EMV without any information?\n- We solved this problem in DA 1 (original decision\ntree).\nEMV[no information] = $150K ≡β\nβ:\nEMV, if the terminal decision is to be made\nwithout any opportunity to obtain additional\ninformation.\nNote:The chance node follows the decision node.\n\nDA 2. The Value of Perfect Information\nExpected Value of Perfect Information\n(EVPI)\nEVPI ≡α - β = $195 - $150 = $45K\n- The EVPI is an upper bound on the amount the\nDM would be willing to pay for additional\ninformation.\n- The expected value of any information source must\nbe between zero and the EVPI. In DA 1, the cost of\nthe survey was $20K < EVPI.\n\nDA 2.

The Value of Perfect Information\nGeneral Tree\n♦If the DM faces uncertainty in a decision\n(uncertainty nodes after the decision node), the\nimpact of perfect information will be evaluated by\nredrawing the tree and reordering the decision and\nchance nodes.\n♦The evaluation of perfect information is done a\npriori. The DM has not yet consulted the\nclairvoyant. The DM is considering whether to\nactually do it.\n\nDA 2. The Value of Perfect Information\nSummary and Observations\n- We have developed single-attribute, multi-stage\nsequential Decision Trees.\n- The model is useful to a single decision maker.\n- Decision Criterion: Maximize the EMV.\n- Maximizing the EMV is not the best decision\ncriterion."
