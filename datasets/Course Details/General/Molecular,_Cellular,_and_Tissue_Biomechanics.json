Suppose a quarter of it is used to power\nkinesin motors for intracellular transport. Estimate how many intracellular cargoes are\ndelivered by kinesin motors from the center of a cell to the cell surface per minute based on the\nfollowing assumptions:\n- There are 4x1013 cells in our body (excluding other microorganisms) (Bianconi, et al.,\nAnn. Human Physiol. 40 463 (2013)).\n- A cell is 5 μm in radius.\n- Each cargo is carried by a kinesin, with a speed of 1 μm/min.\n- A kinesin uses one ATP per 8-‐nm step, consuming 100x10-‐21 J.\nProblem 2 - Protein stiffness\nConsider the measurement of a force-‐extension (F vs. x) curve of a protein with two distinct\ndomains, a globular one which behaves as a freely-‐jointed chain (FJC) and another (the 'rupture\ndomain') that also behaves as a FJC but contains one critical internal bond. This protein is\nrepresented schematically in the figure by the two spheres connected by a short linker region.\nAssume that this protein has been functionalized by the addition of short tether sequences\n(assumed infinitely stiff here) that allow it to be attached to a rigid substrate at the N-‐terminus\nand an AFM tip at the C-‐terminus.\na) Assume that the two domains (of 15 kDa and 24 kDa for the globular and rupture\ndomains, respectively) can each be treated as a freely-‐jointed chain, and that the Kuhn\nlength for both domains is 0.6 nm. What is the approximate size √<R2> of each domain\nbefore pulling? [Note that the average molecular weight of an amino acid is 105 Da, and\nits contour length is 0.4 nm.]\nb) Based on the information provided above, sketch (quantitatively) the force-‐extension\ncurves of the following components of the system:\n\n- The AFM probe (assume it behaves as a linear spring of stiffness, k = 0.1 N/m).\n- The globular domain.\n- The rupture domain with a single, critical internal bond. Assume that before internal\nbond rupture, it behaves as a protein with MW 12 kDa, and that the bond ruptures\nat a force of 10 pN; after rupture, it behaves as a protein with MW 24 kDa.\nc) Sketch (quantitatively) the complete force extension curve F(xp).\nd) It has been proposed to use this system as a single molecule detector, but designing the\nglobular domain to have a binding site for the molecule (e.g., a neurotoxin) to be\ndetected. Assume that the target molecule binds irreversibly to two distinct regions in\nthe globular domain. Draw (qualitatively) the overall force-extension curve (as in part\n(c)) as it would appear before and after binding to the target. Be sure to explain your\nreasoning.\nAFM probe\nGlobular domain\nRupture domain\nXp\nXFJC\nXrupture\nXAFM\n\nProblem 3 - Statistical thermo refresher\nThe two-‐dimensional four amino acid peptide shown below and discussed in Dill & Bromberg\nhas one folded microstate with energy Efolded = 0, and four unfolded microstates each have\nenergy levels of Eunfolded = ε0. The distance between the chain ends is 1 lattice unit for the folded\nstate, 3 lattice units in the fully extended state, and 50.5 lattice units in each of the other three\nchain conformations (.e., the microstates on the left).\nAssume that one lattice unit represents approximately 0.2nm, the typical length of a hydrogen bond.\nPlot the average end-‐to-‐end distance as a function of temperature, if the bond energy is\n(a) ε0\n1.0 kcal/mol\n(b) ε0\n3.0 kcal/mol\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n20.310J / 3.053J / 6.024J / 2.797J Molecular, Cellular, and Tissue Biomechanics\nSpring 2015\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, & TISSUE BIOMECHANICS\n\nSpring 2015\n\nProblem Set #2\n\nDistributed: Tuesday, February 10, 2015\nDue: Wednesday, March 4, 2015\n\nProblem 1: The Flipscope\nIn lecture we discussed a few different methods to obtain single molecule force extension curves or\nunbinding kinetics, including two that were capable of obtaining data on large numbers of molecules\nsimultaneously (recall the centrifugal force scope and the \"flipscope\", both from Wesley Wong's lab at\nHarvard). In the second case, molecules are tethered to a bead at one end, and to a planar surface at\nthe other. Force is applied by gravity when the microscope is rotated 180 degrees due to the difference\nin density between the bead and the surrounding fluid when the scope is inverted (see figure below).\nGiven values: Ip = 0.4 nm, Lc = 40 nm, kaT = 4.1 pN nm\na) First, treating each protein as a random coil (no\ninternal bonds) under a constant force, F = 10 pN,\nuse the Gaussian chain model to calculate the most\nprobable end-to-end length of the protein. Would\nyou expect the Gaussian chain model to provide an\naccurate estimate under this level of force? Why or\nwhy not?\nb) Now, assume that the molecule remains tethered\nto the surface, but has two well-defined\nconformations, which we refer to as states 1 and 2.\nGiven that we know the applied force, and assuming\nthat we have the capability to measure the distance\nof each tethered bead from the surface (i.e., the end\nto-end length of the molecule) show how you would\ncalculate the free energy difference, ΔG, between\nthe two states. That is, provide the equation that\nyou would use to compute ΔG and explain how you\nwould determine each of the other parameters in\nthe equation. You may assume that in this experiment each of the molecules remains attached to both\nthe surface and the bead.\n\nc) Sketch, on a graph of p2 vs. time, the evolution of extended states at two different levels of force. You\ndon't need to provide numbers, but be careful to capture the relative slopes and magnitudes of the two\ncurves and indicate which is at the higher force.\nProblem 2 - Motor walking\nOne mode of intracellular transport is by means of molecular motors, which carry cargo contained in\nlipid vesicles along the filaments that span the intracellular space. Motors such as kinesin (shown in the\nimage), walk along these filaments (microtubules) in a hand-over-hand movement in which one hand\nremains fixed to the filament while the other reaches over, binds to the filament and causes release of\nthe one behind. This can be likened to the hand-over-hand motion of someone climbing a rope.\nIn this problem we ask how far a motor can travel along a filament before it breaks loose. You can\nassume the following:\n- During the time that one \"hand\" of the motor is attached to the filament, it exerts a constant force F\n= 2 pN in order to drag its cargo (the vesicle) along.\n- That the unbinding of the motor from the filament can be viewed as a transition between two\nstates, one bound and one free.\n- That each step that the motor takes is 8\nnm in length and that the rate of stepping\nis such that the time during which the\nmotor is exerting the (constant) force F is\n0.2 s during each step.\n- That the difference in free energy\nbetween the bound and free states (G2 -\nG1) = 2 pN.nm, that the distance from the\nbound state to the unbound state is X2 -\nX1 = 3 nm, and the distance from state 1\nto the transition state is 1 nm.\na) What is the ratio of probabilities at equilibrium between the bound (\"1\") and free (\"2\") states when\na force of 2 pN is applied?\nb) Obtain an algebraic equation that can be used to calculate the rate of change of the probability of\nunbinding during the period of time, ΔM, that the motor arm is attached to the filament. (For parts\nb-c of the problem, assume that once unbound, the motor cannot rebind to the filament and that\nthe value of the unforced rate constant k+\n0 = 0.1 s-1.)\nc) Solve the equation in (b) to estimate the probability that the motor will unbind during a single step.\nYou can assume that once the bond is ruptured, it cannot reform, and that the initial probability of\nbeing bound (state \"1\") is p1 = 1 at M = 0).\nd) Given your result in (c), and assuming that unbinding is an independent event on each step, how far\non average will the motor walk along the filament before it has a 50% probability of unbinding?\n\nProblem 3:\nConsider the RNA unfolding experiments by Liphardt et al. (Science 2001) where a RNA hairpin unfolds\nunder force. The experiment can be modeled as a two state system of RNA transitioning between an\nunfolded and a folded state with a force dependent equilibrium constant Keq(F) . Plotting the logarithm\nof Keq, i.e. In(Keq}, vs. the applied force F yields the following result:\na) Based on the plot In(Keq} vs. F, calculate the distance OX between the folded state and the\nunfolded state.\nb) Using your result from (a) and the information from the graph, determine the equilibrium\nconstant in the absence of force, K q, and the unfolding free energy, OG, between the folded\nand the unfolded state. Express in terms of kaT and also in kJ/moI. Does this amount of free\nenergy, OG, seem reasonable for a RNA hairpin of C20 nucleotide pairs? Assume that\nexperiments are done at room temperature, i.e. kaT C 4.1 pN·nm.\nc) Derive an expression for the fraction of unfolded molecules (to the total number of molecules)\nas a function of force. What fraction of molecules is in the unfolded state when no force is\napplied? At what force are 50% of the molecules unfolded?\nd) Assuming that the transition state is approximately equidistant between the folded and\nunfolded state, sketch the energy landscape of the system (using protein extension as the\nreaction coordinate) (i) nin the absence of force and (ii) with C15pN force applied.\n\nProblem ,\nCertain pathological conditions are associated with changes that occur only intermittently, and are\ntherefore sometimes difficult to observe during infrequent visits to the clinic. In this case, assume that\nthe disease is associated with infrequent increases in blood flow velocity to a particular organ. The\nproposed solution to capture a record of this event is to inEect \"flow probes\" which consist of a\nmicrosphere tethered to a protein that forms a strong and persistent bond with one of the receptors\nexpressed on the surface of endothelial cells (that line the inside wall of the blood vessels) of a particular\norgan. These probes, when subEected to high flow creating a drag force on the bead, produce a\nconformational change in the protein bridging between the bead and the receptor, switching its\nconformation so that the protein becomes fluorescent. (There are a number of ways to do this, but for\nnow we are interested in the mechanics of the change in conformation rather than in the imaging\ndetails.)\na) As a first approximation, the protein used can be modeled as a Gaussian chain having a\npersistence length of 0.4 nm and a total contour length of 400 nm. What is the radius of\ngyration of the protein?\nb) Actually, none of the three models discussed in class (Gaussian chain, FFC, WLC) does a very\ngood Eob in describing the behavior of protein unfolding. Why?\nc) When the probe becomes tethered to the wall (under Gero flow conditions), the configuration is\nas shown schematically in Fig. 1a. The protein is engineered so that it can be characteriGed by\nthe two-state energy landscape shown in Fig. 1b. What is the difference between the two free\nenergies, G1 - G2 if you want HH.H% of the protein sensors to reside in state \"1\" under Gero\nforce?\nd) How much force must be exerted on the microbead by the flow in order to switch 50% of the\nprotein into state \"2\"?\ne) If the elevated flow state is short-lived, then it is important that a large fraction of the proteins\nshift into the extended (fluorescent) state during this short period. What is the ratio of rate\nconstants k\"/k# under a force of 5 pN? Given that you could calculate the individual values of k\"\nand k# for this condition, what equation would you solve to determine the rate at which state\n\"1\" becomes repopulated? (We want an equation here for d$1IdM in terms of the rate constants\nand probabilities, $1 and $2).\nf) Once the protein is switched into state \"2\", it must remain there for some period of time (e.g.,\nremain fluorescent), under Gero force, until the patient returns to the clinic for observation.\nConsidering the energy landscape of Fig. 1b, describe one way in which you might redesign the\nprotein to slow the rate at which it reverts to state \"1\" without changing the ratios of $1 and $2\nunder the forced or unforced conditions. Only a qualitative answer is expected.\n\nFig. 1a\nFig. 1b\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n20.310J / 3.053J / 6.024J / 2.797J Molecular, Cellular, and Tissue Biomechanics\nSpring 2015\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, & TISSUE BIOMECHANICS\nSpring 2015\nProblem Set #6 - Cytoskeleton mechanics\nDistributed: Wednesday, April 15, 2015\nDue: Thursday, April 23, 2015\nProblem 1: Transmigration\nA critical step in the process of metastatic cancer is the migration of a tumor cell from the lumen of a\nblood vessel, across the endothelial monolayer, into the surrounding tissue. Our lab, as well as many\nothers, is investigating this process of transendothelial migration in the hope that by understanding the\nmechanisms and the molecules involved, we might be able to identify ways to block the ability of the\ncells to form metastatic tumors, the cause of more than 90% of deaths due to cancer. In this problem,\nwe examine the forces involved and how we might study these in a controlled, in vitro experiment using\nthe methods discussed in class.\na) First, consider a single cell under\ninternal contraction (e.g., the\nactomyosin matrix inside the cell\ngenerates a uniform tensile stress),\nwhich we can infer from the traction\nstresses exerted by the cell on a\ncompliant substrate containing\nfluorescent microbeads (termed\n\"Traction Force Microscopy\" or TFM).\nTo simplify, consider the planar case as\nshown in Fig. 1, with all stresses and\ndisplacements in the x1 x2 plane. Plot\nqualitatively the bead displacements\njust beneath the gel surface from the\nresting (zero stress) condition vs.\ndistance in the graph shown here.\nShow both positive and negative\nvalues.\nb) On a graph similar to the one you generated in (a), plot qualitatively the spatial distribution of shear\nstress exerted by the cell on the flexible gel substrate assuming that the focal adhesions are\nconcentrated near the edges of the cell. Show both positive and negative stresses based on the\ncoordinate system shown in the figure.\nc) If the modulus of the compliant substrate is G' = 1 kPa and the maximum bead displacement δ = 1 μm,\nuse a scaling analysis to estimate the magnitude of the shear stress (σ21) exerted by the cell on the\nsubstrate. The cell has dimensions L = 30 μm and h = 5 μm and rests on a substrate of thickness H = 300\n\nμm (not drawn to scale in the figure). The focal adhesions can be assumed to extend a length L/5 at\nboth ends of the cell.\nd) Stresses acting at the cell substrate interface are due to motor activity inside the cell, giving rise to a\nroughly uniform internal prestress in the cytoskeleton. Using your calculations above, draw an\nappropriate control volume and use it to estimate the normal stress (prestress) acting on the mid plane\nof the cell. (If you couldn't answer (c), then express your answer in terms of an unknown maximum\nshear stress σmax.)\ne) Now consider a cell monolayer consisting of many cells extending in the positive and negative x1\ndirections (see below). Again, plot the displacements of beads within the gel substrate as a function of\nposition, assuming for this part that there is no stress transmitted between cells through the cell cell\njunctions.\nf) Now consider a situation where the\namount of (tensile) stress transmitted\nthrough the cell cell junction is non\nzero, while assuming that the stress\ninternal to the cell remains constant.\nWhat is the effect on your plot in (e)?\ng) One of the fundamental questions\nthat arises in the context of tumor cell\ntransmigration, is whether the tumor\ncell forces its way through the\nendothelial monolayer or induces the\nendothelium to release the cell cell\njunctions allowing the tumor cell to\npass through easily. How might you\nuse traction force microscopy to\naddress this question? A one\nparagraph answer should be sufficient.\n(Note that there is likely to be more\nthan one correct answer to this. We are looking more for a logical thought process rather than THE one\ncorrect answer.)\nh) By using fluorescent probes, it is observed that the F actin concentration, at the point where the\ntumor cell is entering, appears to be higher by approximately a factor of two compared to the rest of the\ncell. Based on the tensegrity microstructural model for the cytoskeleton, by how much would you\nexpect the modulus of the cell to increase? (You may need to make some assumptions to answer this\nproblem. If so, state them clearly.)\n\nProblem 2 - Microstructural model\nConsider a very simplified model for a random network of macromolecules, in which we represent the\nnetwork as an array of molecules arranged in a cubic lattice, as schematically shown in the figure. The\nmolecules are crosslinked at the junction points (the\nsmall circles at the corner) and this single unit cube\nof molecules is repeated in space to make up the\nmolecular network. Assume that all the molecules\nhave the same properties: N links of Kuhn length h,\nand can be modeled as Gaussian chains at\ntemperature T. The equilibrium length, ro, of each\nmolecule is r0 = b 2N / 3 .\na) If we load this molecular network along the\nvertical direction indicated in the figure, what will\nbe the measured macroscopic Young's modulus, E?\nWhat will be the Poisson ratio, ν?\nb) What happens to the Young's modulus if we\nincrease the temperature? Why?\n\nProblem 3: Paper abstract\nThe third part of this assignment is to write an abstract for your term paper, following the guidelines in\nthe course materials handed out earlier (see below and also posted on Stellar). Your abstract to be\nhanded in with this assignment should be approximately 250 words, providing a description of the topic,\nhow it fits with the course material, and the names of others in your group. Everyone should hand in\ntheir own abstract, however, it can be the same for all members of your group.\nCourse Project and Term Paper guidelines\nThe Course Project is designed as a team effort for groups of approximately 3 students. Teams are\nexpected to hand in a written report and present their work in a brief presentation to the class at the\nend of the term. The report is to be written entirely by the team. You should acknowledge other\nsources with proper citations.\nThe project will entail a detailed spec sheet summarizing various aspect of your chosen biological\ncomponent. We have posted a sample spec sheet on the Stellar site. We encourage you to expand on\nthe sample spec sheet and contribute your own creativity.\nOverall, we expect the following:\n\nThe spec sheet should be between 5 - 10 pages in length.\n\nYou can use the sample/template spec sheets posted on the Stellar site as guide. Feel free to\ncome up with your own spec sheet organization scheme as well. Extra points for creativity.\n\nWe are looking not only for breath but also depth in your spec sheets. Some topics (not limited)\nto consider are:\no Background / components / subcomponents\no Structure and function/role relevant to biology and biomechanics\no Tools used to study the biological component\no Role in disease\no Models used to study the biological components\no Future Research / Applications\no Interesting unanswered questions\no Research groups and their web address working on this system\n\nFor each topic you consider, make sure to include figures and captions detailing important\nfindings. We expect you to critically discuss the relevance (What does this figure show and why\nis it important?) of such figure and not simply copy a caption straight from the literature\nreference.\n\nBe sure to cite your references. Feel free to use PubMed and Web of Science when doing your\nresearch. No Wikipedia references and use original sources (manuscripts and books, rather than\nwebsites or databases) wherever possible.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n20.310J / 3.053J / 6.024J / 2.797J Molecular, Cellular, and Tissue Biomechanics\nSpring 2015\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, & TISSUE BIOMECHANICS\n\nSpring 2015\n\nProblem Set #8 - Membrane mechanics, cell motility and combined problems\n\nDistributed: Wednesday, April 29, 2015\nNot to be handed in\n\nPrimary Cilium\n\nThe primary cilium (PC) is a single cilium that protrudes from most mammalian cells and plays a critical\nrole in chemical and mechanical signaling, and although discovered more than 100 years ago, only\nrecently has the PC been linked to essential phenomena in cases ranging from embryonic development\nto cancer12. PC in kidney epithelial cells sense the flow of urine and use this as a means to regulate cell\nproliferation. Being microtubule-based, the PC is relatively rigid and can transmit forces and bending\nmoments to various intracellular structures. In this problem, we will examine several different issues\nrelating to PC mechanics.\n\nPC Radius = a = 100 nm\nMicrotubule radius = am = 12 nm\nEI = bending stiffness of the PC treated as a beam = 1.4 x 10-23 Nm2\nYoung's modulus of a microtubule, treated as a solid rod of radius am, = 1 GPa\nPC Length = L = 6 μm\nMembrane bending stiffness = Kb = 2 x 10-18 Nm\nMembrane tension (assumed uniform) = N = 10-5 N/m\n\na) Approximate the PC (neglecting the basal body) as a beam connected to a stiff support at its base that\ncan support a bending moment. Calculate the bending moment at the membrane and sketch the\ndeformed shape of the beam, assuming that the flow-induced force can be modeled as a point force F\nacting at the tip of the PC.\nb) Using any method you choose, estimate the force F (if applied at the tip and in a direction\nperpendicular to the axis of the PC) required to deflect the tip of the PC a distance of 1 μm. You may\ntreat the PC as a solid, homogeneous beam with the characteristics given above.\n\n1 Michaud EJ and Yoder BK, Cancer Research, 66: 6463, 2006.\n2 Singla V and Reiter JF, Science, 313: 629, 2006\n\nR (radius of curvature)\n\nc) Neglecting the effects of the cell membrane and assuming that all of the stress is supported by the 9\ndoublet microtubules that dominate the internal structure of the PC (see figure), describe the\ndistribution of forces among these microtubules at the point where the PC meets the cell body. That is,\nshow (sketch) qualitatively the relative magnitude and direction of the force in each doublet as a\nfunction of distance from the center of the PC (x) in a plot as shown below, where x is the coordinate\nparallel to the direction of force application. Pay particular attention to whether the forces are tensile\n(positive) compressive (negative) or both.\nForce/doublet\nx\nd) Estimate by an approximate analysis the maximum level of tensile force acting in just one of the\ndoublet microtubules at the base of the PC, where it enters into the cell body, using the values given\nabove and corresponding to the deflection described in (b).\ne) Now, treat the internal structure of the cell as a linear elastic material (shear modulus G and Poisson\nratio ν) that extends far in all directions, and that the forces just described are acting at the surface of\n\nthis elastic material. Sketch the deflections at the surface caused by the force distribution from (c) and\nmagnitude from (d) and estimate by an approximate analysis the maximum vertical deflection of the\nsurface. (You don't need to calculate the actual value, just provide the scaling relationship in terms of\nthe defined variables.)\nf) Now focusing on the lipid bilayer, estimate the radius of curvature at the base of the PC where it\nmeets the cell body. Consider the case when the PC is not subjected to a force (F=0), and looks as\nshown in the left hand sketch in the figure. The radius of curvature of interest is labeled R in the figure.\n\nCancer cell with interstitial flow\n\nRecent experiments (Polacheck et al., PNAS, 2011) have produced the intriguing result that the\ndirectional persistence of cancer cells migrating through extra cellular matrix (ECM) is influenced by flow\nof interstitial fluid as induced by pressure gradients in the vicinity of a tumor. This problem probes a\nnumber of questions that relate to the underlying mechanisms for this observation.\nFor purposes of this problem, consider the cancer cell as a sphere of radius R, within an infinite,\nhomogeneous ECM and exposed to a uniform fluid flow velocity V (Fig. 1). The ECM has a hydraulic\npermeability of kECM and a shear modulus, GECM. The viscosity of the interstitial fluid is η.\n\na) Due to the flow, the cell experiences a net\nforce in the direction of flow, F, due to a\ncombination of fluid pressure (normal stress,\np) and fluid shear (shear stress = as). The\nlatter can be shown to scale as V / V(kECM η).\nUse Darcy's equation (the equation that\nrelates to the pressure gradient and flow\nvelocity through a porous medium):\n\nV\n∇p =\n\nk\n\nand scaling analysis to estimate the net force\nacting on the cell due to pressure, Fp, and obtain a ratio of Fp to the total force due to shear stress,\nFs. Using the typical values given at the end of this problem, obtain a numerical value for this ratio.\nb) Given the total force due to the combined effects of fluid pressure and fluid shear F as computed in\n(a), and the shear modulus of the ECM given below, find an approximate (scaling) expression for\nthe distance 6 that the cell is displaced due to the combined effects of fluid pressure and shear.\nAssume that the cell retains its spherical shape, but that the surrounding ECM is locally distorted\ndue to the force exerted on it by the cell.\n\nc) Now assume that the entire fluid force acting on the cell is supported by the membrane-ECM\ninteractions on the downstream side of the cell, where the membrane pushes against the filaments\nthat comprise the ECM (see Fig. 2). Assume that all of the force computed in (b) is transmitted by\nthe cytoskeleton to the cell membrane, which is supported externally by forces exerted by the\nmatrix filaments in contact with the membrane. If, in electron micrographs the cell membrane\nappears as shown in the figure, so that the characteristic length is the spacing between filaments, L,\nwhich is more important in terms of supporting the force, membrane bending or membrane\n\ntension? You may assume that the membrane has a tension of 10-5 N/m (The values for bending\nstiffness, Kb, and L are given below).\n\nd) In reality, as the cell migrates in the upstream direction (to the left in Fig. 3), it leaves behind it a\nregion void of matrix material due to the enzymatic degradation of the matrix metalloproteases\nreleased by the cell. The cell must therefore support itself (balance the force F, which acts to the\nright in the figure) by adhering to the matrix via the integrin adhesion receptors located in the\nupstream facing side of the cell membrane. These integrins form adhesive molecular bonds\ntethering the cell membrane to the ECM filaments. Given that (i) the solid fraction of the ECM, aECM\n= (a L)2 = 0.01, (ii) the integrin molecule density on the cell membrane is 300 molecules/1m2, and\n(iii) there is excess ligand on the filaments to which the integrins can bind, estimate the average\nforce per integrin bond supporting the cell. Is this level of force sufficient to rupture the integrin\nECM bond? Is it sufficient to activate the cell (that is, to elicit a biological response from the cell)?\nBe sure to explain your answers. (Hint: Start by estimating the area of contact between the cell\nmembrane and the filaments of the matrix.)\n\nParameter Values:\nk\nm2.Pa-1.s-1\nG\nECM = 10-11\nECM = 10 Pa\nη = 10-3 Pa.s\n\nR = 10 1m\na = 10 nm\n\nL =\n100 nm\nV = 2x10-6 m/s\nK = 10-19 N.m\n\nBead forces on a cell\n\nIn many of the experiments used to probe cell mechanics, a bead is attached to the cell membrane via\nsurface-bound receptors and force is applied either by a magnetic or optical trap. Here we consider\nsuch an experiment in which the force is applied in a direction normal to the plane of the cell\nmembrane. We consider in the following questions the relative importance of the membrane and\ncytoskeleton (CSK) in resisting or balancing this force.\nIn parts (a) - (c), consider only the cell membrane, ignoring the effects of the CSK.\na) Draw the shape of the membrane in the vicinity of the bead for the case in which there is no\nmembrane bending stiffness (K =0) and only membrane tension acts to balance the force. See the figure\nfor an example in which both tension and bending are present.\nb) In reality, bending will be important at least in a small region close to where the bead is attached (see\nthe region inside the dashed circle in the figure). Given that bending and tension must be comparable in\nmagnitude within this region, use an order of magnitude analysis to estimate the surface tension, N, in\nterms of the bending stiffness of the membrane, K J and the radius of curvature of the membrane close\nto the bead (r).\nc) In a figure similar to that of Fig. 1 draw a control volume that will allow you to calculate an\napproximate relationship between the vertical force, F, applied to the bead and the surface tension in\nthe membrane, N. Taking a value of 1 nN for F, calculate the surface tension, N, and a value for r\ndefined in the figure. Note that the bead is spherical.\n\nNow, for part (d) neglect membrane stiffness and consider the case in which the force on the bead is\nbalanced by the stiffness of the CSK.\nd) Using a scaling analysis, estimate the distance 8 that the cell would be deflected, given the shear\nmodulus of the CSK, G, and the radius of the region of contact between the cell and the bead, a.\nNow consider the combined effects of the membrane and the CSK.\ne) We now wish to determine whether the membrane or the CSK is the dominant structure in terms of\nresisting deformation. Using your answers from (b) and (d) above, obtain a dimensionless ratio that\nrepresents the force supported by the membrane divided by the force supported by the CSK. Given the\nfollowing values:\n-\nG = 1000 Pa\n-\n{ = 500 nm\n-\nr = 100 nm\n-\nK = 10-18\n\nN.m\n-\nF = 0.1 nN\n-\na = 1 1m\n\nWhich structure dominates?\n\nHorse racing\nWhile watching the Kentucky Derby (and thinking about the biomechanics exam), I recalled some\nstudies done years ago by a prominent pulmonary physiologist, John West, that addressed a common\nproblem in racehorses (but has also been observed in humans, camels and greyhounds!). Apparently,\nexercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) occurs in 50-75% of racing quarter horses and results\nfrom ruptured pulmonary capillaries. The cause, interestingly, has not been convincingly demonstrated,\nalthough it is thought to be associated with a combination of elevated pulmonary blood pressure, and\nthe increased negative gas pressures created in the lung during inspiration under intense exertion. Here\nwe explore the plausibility of this theory, based on the mechanics of the endothelial monolayer.\nCapillaries in the lung run through the narrow walls that separate one gas-filled alveolus from another\n(see Figure 1). Consider the blood pressure inside the capillaries to be 20 kPa higher than the air\npressure in the alveolus (acting external to the capillary), and (in a worst case scenario) assume that all\nthe pressure difference is supported by the endothelial monolayer. The capillary radius can be taken to\nbe 5 μm. Assume also that the load on the capillary wall due to the pressure difference is equally\ndistributed between the two endothelial lipid bilayers (inside and outside), and that the capillary can be\nenvisioned as a thin-walled tube of circular cross-section (Figure 2).\na) Calculate the surface tension acting in the circumferential (θ) direction in a single bilayer.\n\nb) Is this surface tension sufficient to cause rupture of the bilayer? You may assume that the\nbilayer is 5 nm thick, has an effective Young's modulus of 1 GPa , a Poisson ratio of 0.4, and that\nrupture occurs at strains of >3%.\nc) An alternative explanation for the hemorrhaging is that the cell junctions rupture. If the cells\nare assumed to be arranged in such a way that, for each cell, 500 cadherin junctions support the\nload (assume that one cell layer extends 20 microns in the axial (z) direction, perpendicular to\nthe plane of the paper), what is the force per cadherin junction?\nd) Is the force calculated in (c) high enough to cause the bond to rupture? (You are not expected\nto know the rupture force of a cadherin junction, but should be able to estimate it, and provide\na brief explanation of your answer.)\n\nFigure 1. A single alveolus showing the\nepithelial layer lining the inner wall\nwith vascular capillaries in the wall\nbetween neighboring epithelial layers.\nThe capillary is shown flattened, but in\nour example, would be circular in cross-\nsection.\n\nFigure 2. Cross-sectional view of\ncapillary\n\nMigrating cell in three dimensions\n\nThere is currently considerable interest among the cancer research community in determining the forces\ngenerated by a cell as it migrates through a three-dimensional matrix or gel such as the extracellular\nmatrix. Migrating cells often have the appearance shown in the figure below, with actively extending,\nfinger-like protrusions (filopodia) in the front that push through the matrix material, and long tube-like\ntethers in the rear where the cell adheres to the matrix, that eventually must be released if the cell is to\nmake forward progress. This problem considers both the forward protrusions and the tethers at the\nrear.\na) In a set of in vitro\nexperiments designed to\ndetermine the force with\nwhich the cell pushes\nforward into the matrix\n(see Legant, et al., Nature\nMateria/s, 2010, see figure),\nthe cell is induced to\nmigrate through a gel with\na known elastic or Young's\nmodulus, E. In order to\nestimate the force, small\nmarker beads are seeded\ninto the gel and their\ndisplacement is observed\nduring cell migration.\n(These beads can be\nassumed to be rigidly fixed\nto the gel, but have no\neffect on the gel's elastic\nproperties.) As the cell\nsends a protrusion forward,\nthe beads just in front of\nthe leading edge are\nobserved to move a\ndistance δ. Given that the\nprotrusion can be pictured\nas a \"finger\" of radius a, and the deformations are observed to extend into the gel a distance that\nscales with a, estimate the force with which the protruding \"finger\" pushes against the gel.\n\nb) At the trailing tether, the gel is assumed to pull backward with a point force F as shown in the\nmagnified view and in the cross-sectional view, AA. If the tether is viewed as a cylinder with radius\nR, use a force balance to determine the tension N in the membrane that comprises the tether.\n\nc) In the vicinity of the externally acting force at the end of the tether, the membrane shape is\ndetermined by a combination of membrane tension and bending. What relationship must be\nsatisfied if bending and tension effects are approximately in balance? Use this expression in\ncombination with your answer in (b) to obtain an estimate for the radius of the tether, R.\n\nd) Fragments of membrane that have been torn away from the cell are often observed attached to the\nmatrix behind the cell. Given the parameter values below and the fact that membranes (lipid\nbilayers) rupture when they stretch about 3% (ε11 N 0.03), estimate the maximum force F that can be\nsustained by the tether.\n\nParameter Values:\nK = 10-19 N.m\n\nE = 108 N/m2\n\nh = 6x10-9 m\n\nMicropipette aspiration\nExperiments using micropipettes have provided evidence suggesting that neutrophils possess a\nmembrane (or membrane plus \"cortex\") that behaves mechanically as though it were in a state of\nuniform and constant surface tension. To determine the magnitude of this surface tension (and\ndemonstrate support for the concept of a constant surface tension), micropipettes with different\ndiameters are used to aspirate the cell. In each experiment with a given diameter pipette, the pressure\nwithin the pipette is incrementally reduced (made more negative). For pressure magnitudes below a\ncritical threshold, the cell attains an equilibrium position and stops. For pressure magnitudes above this\nthreshold value, the cell continues to flow and eventually is drawn entirely into the pipette. The unique\nvalue of the critica/ pressure is noted for each diameter pipette.\na) O tain an expression for the critica/ pressure required to draw a neutrophi/ into the pipette on the\nassumption that:\n-\nThe initial cell radius (before aspiration), Rc, is known from the measurement to be 4 μm.\n-\nThe cell volume remains constant during the course of an experiment.\n-\nThe cell membrane can increase its total surface area while maintaining a constant effective\nsurface tension, N.\n-\nThe cell interior behaves as a viscous fluid with G'=0.\n-\nThe bending stiffness of the cell membrane can be neglected.\nExpress your answer in terms of a (known) pipette radius, Rp.\nb) Using the experimenta/ data shown in the figure e/owJ ca/cu/ate the effective surface tension of the\nce//J N.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n20.310J / 3.053J / 6.024J / 2.797J Molecular, Cellular, and Tissue Biomechanics\nSpring 2015\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "CHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\nChapter 3.1\n\nCell Membrane Mechanics and Adhesion\n\n3.1.1 Introduction\n\nMembranes perform a critical function, providing a selective barrier between the cell interior and\nthe living processes inside, and the lifeless, often inhospitable environment outside. In the\nsimplest of terms, the cell membrane can be thought of as a lipid bilayer that separates the\ncytoplasmic and extracellular domains. Indeed, our approach to modeling membrane mechanics\nrelies much on this simplification. The true cell membrane, however, is vastly more complex\nthan this simple representation would suggest, and we begin this chapter by describing some of\nthis complexity and its implications to the mechanical properties of the cell. Since the membrane\nand associated structures behave as an integral structural element of the cell, we next develop the\nmethods for investigating membrane mechanics, both theoretical and experimental. In the last\nsection of this chapter, the means by which the cell adheres to its environment are discussed\nalong with the methods used to probe these adhesive properties through experimentation and\nanalyze the results quantitatively.\n\n3.1.2 Membrane Structure and Biology\n\nMembrane composition and organization\nAlthough much of the discussion of this chapter will be directed to the outer, limiting cell\nmembrane, it is important to realize that much of the membrane of a cell is intracellular and\nserves the purpose of partitioning regions in the cell, such as the nucleus or mitochondria, from\nthe cytoplasm. While each type of membrane has its own unique characteristics, their basic\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nstructure remains much the same. For that reason, despite our focus on the outer or plasma\nmembrane, the material in this chapter applies more generally to all cell-associated membranes.\n\nFig. 3.1.1. A space-filling model of the lipid bilayer showing the hydrophilic heads (polar head\ngroups) on the outside, and the hydrophobic tails pointing in, on the interior. The total thickness\nof the bilayer is about 6 nm. [Reproduced from Molecular Cell Biology, Lodish, et al., 2000]\nWhen we use the term membrane, we are generally referring to the phospholipid bilayer\nand the proteins associated with it. The phospholipids contained in the membrane are arranged\nin two layers or leaflets, with their hydrophobic tails pointing inward and their hydrophilic heads\noutward. Together, they constitute a bilayer about 6 nm in thickness (Fig. 3.1.1). Four\nphospholipids account for more than half the lipid in most membranes; these are\nphosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. The\nfirst and second of these are predominantly in the outer leaflet while the third and fourth are\nmore common in the inner leaflet. In addition to these phospholipids, the membrane contains\nglycolipids and cholesterol. While the amount of glycolipid is small, constituting only about 2%\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nof the total lipid content, cholesterol is a major membrane constituent, roughly 20% by weight, a\nvalue that remains quite constant among the different cell types.\nSeveral of these lipids are critical for their role in determining membrane structural\nintegrity. These include the four major phospholipids and cholesterol. For example, both the\nbending stiffness and the viscosity of the lipid bilayer, sometimes referred to as membrane\nfluidity, are strongly dependent on the cholesterol content.\nOther important membrane constituents are the membrane-associated proteins, which\naccount for roughly 50% of the membrane by weight but because of their relatively large\nmolecular weight, only about 1-2% of the number of molecules comprising the membrane.\nThese serve a variety of functions from signaling, to the transport of ions and other molecules\nacross the membrane, to the adhesion of the cell to surrounding structures as will be discussed\nmore later. One subclass includes the integral membrane proteins, those that penetrate into the\nlipid bilayer, can be classified according to their means of attachment to the bilayer:\n\n- proteins that attach primarily through interactions with the hydrophobic core (this\nsubgroup contains most ion channels),\n- transmembrane proteins attached by only one hydrophobic segment (including many\nmembrane-bound antibodies, some receptors of the integrin family, and several other\ntypes of receptor),\n- proteins attached to the membrane by lipid anchors, or\n- proteins adsorbed to the membrane through interactions with the charged head groups.\n\nSome membrane-associated proteins are bound through other proteins (Fig. 3.1.2); these are\ncalled peripheral proteins and can be made to dissociate from the membrane by introducing\nfluids with extreme values of pH or high salt concentrations that disrupt the covalent bonds\ntypically used for attachment.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\nFig. 3.1.2. Schematic of the lipid bilayer and associated proteins, either integral or peripheral.\n[Reproduced from Molecular Cell Biology, Lodish, et al., 2000]\nThe critical importance of these proteins can be illustrated by describing some of their\nmany functions. One group of proteins serves as ion or water channels and pumps to control the\nintracellular ionic concentrations (H+, Na+, Cl+, Mg++, Ca++). In the case of the red blood cell or\nerythrocyte, for example, the cytosol is maintained at a potential approximately -6 mV relative to\nthe blood plasma. Intracellular osmotic pressure (~150 mosm) and pH (~7.4) are also\nmaintained within narrow limits. Many channels are active ion transporters, pumping ions\nagainst a concentration gradient and requiring an external source of energy, often by ATP\nhydrolysis. Others, however, perform facilitated diffusion, meaning that they help to regulate the\nexchange of ions across the membrane in the direction of the concentration gradient, but require\nno external energy. One class of these of particular interest in biomechanics includes the\nmechanically-sensitive ion channels that open or close under the action of stresses transmitted by\nthe membrane or via attachments to the cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix. One such channel\nlocated in the stereocilia of hair cells in the tympanic membrane mediates the sensation of sound.\nThe mechanism by which forces regulate these channels is discussed in Chapter 3.3. Other ion\nchannels are regulated by a change in protein conformation resulting from binding by some\nsignaling molecule (so-called ligand-gated channels), or by changes in the transmembrane\nvoltage potential (voltage-gated channels). Much of what we know about these ion channels\ncomes from experiments using the patch clamp technique, in which drawing it into the tip of a\nmicropipet isolates a small section of membrane. This method, developed by Neher and\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nSakmann in 1976, has spawned many of the experiments on which our current understanding of\nmembrane ion transport is based.\n\nOther integral membrane proteins are used for adhesion of the cell to surrounding\nstructures, for signaling, or for the control of biochemical reactions. Discussion of adhesion\nproteins will come later, in Section 3.1.6. Signaling is accomplished in a variety of ways, but is\nmost often mediated by the transfer of molecules across the membrane either directly by\ndiffusion or via selective channels, or by binding of a ligand to a cell surface receptor. Each time\na signal is \"received\" by means of receptor-ligand binding, the result is a conformational change\nin the receptor that initiates other biological processes via a signaling cascade involving a host of\nother intermediate molecules. Not infrequently, the reaction initiated by ligand-receptor binding\nis with another protein located within the membrane or closely associated with it. Being\nconstrained to two dimensions, rather than free to move in three, can greatly accelerate reactions\nthat are diffusion-limited. For example, the time required for a molecule to reach a target of\ndiameter dT located a distance L away is approximately L\n3 /(3DdT ) in three dimensions and\n(L\n2 /2D)ln(L / dT ) in two, where D is the diffusion coefficient (Hardt 1979).\n\nRecognizing its fluid-like nature and multi-component structure, Singer and Nicolson\nproposed the fluid mosaic model for the membrane in 1972. This model emphasizes that the\nlipids form a highly fluid-like phase while the proteins tend to aggregate in isolated islands that\nare relatively rigidly structured, giving rise to a mosaic-like arrangement. Both the proteins and\nlipids are free to diffuse within the plane of the membrane unless tethered to fixed structures\neither internal or external to the cell. The fluid-like nature of the membrane, especially the lipid\nportion, accounts for the low resistance to shear deformations in the plane of the membrane. In\naddition, the hydrophobic interior behaves essentially like a hydrocarbon fluid allowing the two\nleaflets to slide freely relative to one another.\n\nAside from the lipid bilayer, the cell plasma membrane has associated macromolecular\nstructures on both intra- and extracellular sides giving rise to a three-layer composite\nconstruction. On the intracellular side, the membrane is physically attached to a cortex or the\ncytoskeleton. The cortex is a dense, filamentous structure that lends stiffness to the membrane,\nand can also interact with various transmembrane proteins, often impeding their free diffusion\neither by steric interactions or direct chemical bonding. In some cells, the cortex is simply a\nregion of dense cytoskeletal matrix in the vicinity of the bilayer. In others, it exhibits a distinctly\ndifferent structure or composition. For example, erythrocytes possess a cortex comprised of a\nnetwork of spectrin tetramers linked by actin filaments. This network is attached to the\nmembrane by ankyrin and the integral membrane protein band 3 (Fig. 3.1.3). This spectrin\nnetwork accounts for much of the bending stiffness exhibited by the red cell membrane.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nFig. 3.1.3.

[From\nMolecular Biology of the Cell, Bruce Alberts, Dennis Bray, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith\nRoberts, James D. Watson (c) 1994]\nExternal to most cells is found a glycocalyx, which has been shown to extend as far as 0.5\nμm from the surface of endothelial cells where it forms a compressible barrier separating\ncirculating erythrocytes and leucocytes from the endothelial membrane. The glycocalyx is\ncomprised of short oligosaccharide chains, glycoproteins, glycolipids and high molecular weight\nproteoglycans, all organized into an interconnected network with an overall negative charge.\nAlthough its function is not completely understood, it apparently plays a role in macromolecular\ntransport across the endothelium and is an important factor in the interaction between blood-\nborne cells and the endothelium. Studies have demonstrated that the glycocalyx in a capillary is\nreadily compressed by a passing leukocyte, yet is sufficiently rigid to prevent flowing\nerythrocytes from approaching the endothelial surface (Fig. 3.1.4).\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nFig. 2.1.4.

The capillary wall is visualized by a\nmembrane-specific dye, PKH26 in A and C. Width\nof the glycocalyx is indicated by the gap between the\nerythrocytes and the wall in A and C, and by the\nchange in effective capillary diameter before (B) and\nafter (D) epi-illumination. In this series, capillary\ndiameter increased from 4.7 to 5.4 μm suggesting a\nwidth of the glycocalyx of 0.35 μm. [Reproduced\nfrom Vink & Duling (Vink and Duling 1996).\n\n3.1.3 Membrane Mechanics\n\nFor the purpose of analysis, we treat the cell membrane as a homogeneous two-dimensional plate\nor sheet completely enclosing the cytoplasm. The membrane referred to here can be thought of\neither as the lipid bilayer by itself, or more typically, as the bilayer plus the associated cortex of\ncytoskeletal filaments and glycocalyx on the extracellular surface. In addition, though not\nexplicitly recognized in the analysis, transmembrane proteins and their attachments to the\nintracellular and extracellular milieu are included in terms of their influence on the continuum\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nproperties of the model. Were it not for these, the membrane would exhibit little resistance to\nshear deformation.\n\nIn qualitative terms, the lipid bilayer can be thought of as a two-dimensional fluid, within\nwhich the individual lipid molecules, or other molecules embedded in the membrane, are\nrelatively free to move about by diffusion or directed motion. Phospholipid molecules in either\nof the two layers resist being pulled apart, however, so each layer is highly inextensible. This\nalso contributes to the bending stiffness, which is low in absolute terms, but high for such a thin\nlayer, since bending requires one layer to expand while the other is compressed. By contrast, the\ntwo layers readily slide relative to each other. These qualitative notions are put in more\nquantitative terms in the next section.\n\nTypes of deformation\n\nAny deformation can be thought of, in general terms, as a superposition of several\nsimpler deformations. For small strains in which linearization is appropriate, the principle of\nsuperposition is rigorously valid. For larger strains, however, linear theory breaks down and\nsuperposition can only be used as a rough, qualitative guide in visualizing combined influences.\nHere we present the three primary types of deformation: pure extension, pure bending, and pure\nshear. Later, we also consider the influence of membrane viscosity in time-dependent\ndeformations.\n\nσ2\nA\nA0\nσ1\nσ1\nx2\nσ2\nx1\n\nFig. 3.1.5. A membrane, initially of area A0, subjected to a uniform extensional stress along its\nedges, σ1 = σ2, causing an increase in area to A.\n\nPure extension. In discussing the extensional stiffness of the membrane, we need to distinguish\nthe behavior at low tension from that at high tension. As you first begin to apply an extensional\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nstress at the edges of a lipid bilayer, the projected or apparent membrane area first increases\nwhile the actual or true membrane area remains constant. This results from the suppression of\nout-of-plane undulations. Forces acting to resist membrane flattening originate from entropic\neffects analogous to those seen in the case of a flexible polymer as its end-to-end distance is\nincreased - many more membrane configurations exist with undulations compared to the single\nperfectly flat state. Only when these undulations have been eliminated does the true membrane\narea, proportional to the surface area per molecule group, begin to increase, and this is associated\nwith a relatively abrupt increase in extensional stiffness. For now, we consider only the stiffness\nof a flat membrane and leave the discussion of undulations of entropic origin to a later point in\nthe chapter. Hence we initially neglect all entropic effects, or equivalently, consider the\nmembrane to be at zero temperature.\nBased in this assumption, consider an infinitesimal plate, initially of area A0 = L 2\n0 that is\ndeformed by a uniform normal stress τ11 = σ1 = τ22 = σ2 applied to its edges (Fig. 3.1.5) to a\nnew area, A. Previously, we derived the expressions relating stress and strain, which in two\ndimensions and in the absence of stresses normal to the x1-x2 plane, can be written:\n\nE\nσα =\n2 (εα + νεβ)\n\n(2.1)\n1-ν\n\nwhere the length of one edge, Lα=L0(1+εα). Note that in this chapter, we use the subscripts α, β\nrather than i, j to distinguish stresses and strains in two dimensions from those, more generally,\nin three. Thus, whereas i and j can be either 1, 2 or 3, α and β are restricted to being either 1 or\n2. When this stress is uniform in the plane of the membrane (the x1- x2 plane) it can be replaced,\nwithout loss of generality, by a surface tension Nα (force per unit length) defined as σ .\nα h where h\nis the thickness of the membrane. These can be combined in the case when N1 = N2 = constant\nand, consequently, ε1 = ε2 = ε to give:\n\nEh\nN =\nε\n\n(2.2)\n1 -ν\n\nIn terms of a plate stretched uniformly in both directions, we can define the areal strain as:\n\nΔA\nA - A\n=\nL0 (1+ ε ) - L\n=\n≅ 2ε\n\n(2.3)\nA0\nA0\nL0\n\nwhere the last approximation is appropriate for small strains. By combining this result with eqn.\n(2.2), we can define the area expansion modulus, Ke (units of N/m),\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\nEh\nΔA\nΔ A\nN =\n≡ K\n\n(2.4)\n2(1-ν) A\ne\nA0\n\nNote that although we used the continuum structural equations in our analysis, the final result\ncan also be viewed as simply the definition of the area expansion modulus and applies regardless\nof whether or not the membrane can be modeled as a continuum.\nExperimental measurements of Ke lie in the range of 0.1-1 N/m for various types of lipid\nbilayers and about 0.45 N/m (450 dyn/cm) for red blood cell membranes (Waugh and Evans\n1979). These numbers suggest that cell membranes are quite resistant to extension and, for that\nreason, are often treated as inextensible1. This high resistance to area change is in large part due\nto the energy penalty associated with exposing the hydrophobic core of the membrane to water\nthat occurs as the spacing between individual amphiphilic molecules is increased [for a detailed\ndescription of bilayer structure and thermodynamics, see Tanford (1980), or Israelachivili\n(1991)]. Continuing to increase extensional stress, the lipid bilayer eventually ruptures, but at\nvery small extensional strains, in the vicinity of 2 to 3% (Mohandas & Evans, 1990). Note that a\nbilayer in a lipid vescicle, for example, stretches primarily by increasing the area per molecule\nsince recruitment of additional material to the membrane occurs very slowly.\n\nUsing these expressions, we can estimate the level of surface tension at which the\nmembrane would rupture. At a 3% extensional strain (6% areal strain) uniformly applied in the\nx1-x2 plane, the surface tension at rupture would be about 0.06 N/m if we use a value near the\nhigher end of the observed range, Ke = 1 N/m. Using Laplace's law [see eqn. (2.27)] for the\nrelationship between the pressure difference (ΔP) across a spherical shell of radius R = 1 μm and\nthe surface tension in the shell gives us:\n\n2N\n\nΔP =\n= 1.2x10\n5 Pa ≅ 1200cmH 2O\nR\n\na remarkably high value of pressure given the thickness of the membrane is only 6 nm!\n\nCells also often exhibit an intrinsic surface tension. Reported values are small, however,\nlying in the range of about 10-5 to 10-4 N/m (Sheets, Simson et al. 1995). For comparison, recall\nthat the surface tension across the interface of a droplet of pure water is about 0.07 N/m, a value\nclose to the rupture stress of the membrane given above. It becomes immediately obvious, then,\nthat the tension of a cell membrane must be orders of magnitude smaller than the surface tension\n\n1 This discussion neglects the effects of thermal fluctuations in the membrane that give rise to a much more\ncompliant behavior at the smallest areal strains. When surface stress is sufficient to smooth out most thermal\nfluctuations, the cell or vesicle will exhibit the large moduli given here. See also Example xx later in this chapter.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nof a typical gas-liquid or liquid-liquid interface since it would otherwise give rise to intracellular\npressures on the order of one atmosphere!\n\nPure bending. By contrast, lipid bilayers exhibit a very low bending stiffness; so low that it is\noften neglected in models of membrane mechanics. It can be important in certain situations,\nhowever, and is essential for example in analyzing the thermal fluctuations of vesicles, discussed\nlater in this chapter.\nBending stiffness arises from the same type of molecular interactions that cause\nextensional stiffness. When an initially flat bilayer is bent, the hydrophilic head groups on the\noutside of the bend move further apart while on the inside, intermolecular spacing decreases;\nboth represent departures from the equilibrium, unstressed state and require energy. If the same\nforces of interaction are responsible, why then is bending stiffness so low? While the answer to\nthis question is not simple, one factor is the membrane thickness, which you recall, is only about\n6 nm. As the membrane bends, therefore, the change in the surface area per molecule is\nextremely small, so the associated extensional strains are also minute.\nReturning to our simple continuum plate model, consider a bending moment applied to\nthe two ends, causing the plate to curve slightly (Fig. 3.1.6). If the bending is due to moments\napplied at the two ends about the x2-axis, then the bending moment per unit length is related to\nthe deflection by\n\nEt 3\n⎛∂2u ⎞\n⎛∂2\n⎞\n⎜\nu\nMα = -\n2 ⎟ = -K B⎜\n2 ⎟\n(2.5)\n12(1-ν ) ⎝∂xα ⎠\n⎝∂xα ⎠\n\nwhere KB is termed the bending stiffness having units of N.m . Implicit in this expression are the\nassumptions that there exists a mid-plane (the \"neutral plane\") on which the in-plane stress and\nstrain are both zero, and that straight lines perpendicular to this mid-plane remain straight and\nnormal to this surface after deformation.\n\nTypical values for the bending stiffness KB lie in the range of 10-19 N.m (10-12 dyn.cm) for\na red blood cell or lipid bilayers (Mohandas & Evans, 1990). This value is larger, on the order of\n1-2x10-18 N.m (Zhelev, Needham et al. 1994), for other cell types (e.g., neutrophils, endothelial\ncells) that possess a more extensive cortex. The methods used to obtain these values will be\ndescribed later in this chapter.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\nFig. 3.1.6. Plate subjected to equal moments M1 at the two edges.\n\nExample. Estimate the moment per unit length acting within an initially flat lipid bilayer (at zero\ntemperature) associated with a wavelength λ = 5 μm and amplitude ε = 1 μm.\nMembrane displacement can be approximated by the expression:\n\nu3 = ε sin (2πx1 / λ)\n\n(2.6)\n\nFrom eqn. (2.5) above, we obtain\n\n⎛ 2π ⎞\n\nM1 = KBε\nsin (2πu\n)\n⎝\n⎠\n3 / λ\n\n(2.7)\nλ\n\nUsing the values given above, the maximum moment per unit length is 0.158 pN.\n\nPure shear. Shear deformations arise when a membrane is stretched in one direction by a\nsurface tension N1 (units of force/length) while the lateral surface contracts under a lesser tension\nN2, at constant surface area and in the absence of bending (Fig. 3.1.7). Surfaces oriented at 45\ndegrees to the boundaries experience pure shear stresses of magnitude (N1 - N2)/2.\nWhen subjected to shear stresses in the plane of the membrane, a pure lipid bilayer\nbehaves essentially as a liquid. It exhibits a membrane viscosity in that it poses a resisting force\nproportional to the rate of shear deformation, but only a small shear modulus to static shear\ndeformations. It is not clear, in fact, whether or not pure lipid bilayers exhibit a non-zero shear\nmodulus. For example, the movement of membrane-bound proteins can be described by a\nsimple diffusion coefficient proportional to the membrane viscosity. Typical cell membranes do\nexhibit a shear modulus, however, largely due to the cortex of cytoskeletal filaments that lie on\nthe intracellular side of the membrane. In a red blood cell this matrix, as discussed above,\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nconsists of interconnected filamentous spectrin and actin with attachments to the membrane via\nankyrin.\n\nN2\nN1\nN1\nN2\n\nFig. 3.1.7. A section of membrane subjected to a shear stress of magnitude N1-N2/2.\n\nThe equations relating shear stress to shear deformation (Hooke's law) from Ch. xx can\nbe applied here\n\nτ12 = τ 21 = 2Gε12\n(2.8)\n\nor, expressed as a shear force per unit length of membrane:\n\nN12 = τ12 h = 2Gε12 = Ksε12\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere we define the membrane shear modulus, Ks, with units of N/m. Typical values lie in the\nrange of 6-9 x 10-6 N/m for a red blood cell membrane. A pure lipid bilayer exhibits a viscous\nresistance to shear deformations characterized by a shear viscosity of about 10-6 N.s/m ((Evans\n1983)).\n\nThe 2D elastic plate -- equations of deformation\nIn the analysis of cellular membranes, several unique characteristics need to be taken into\naccount.\n\n1. The membrane is extremely thin relative to its lateral extent. If we consider the thickness to\nbe that of the lipid bilayer by itself, then h can be as small as 6 nm compared to a typical cell\ndimension on the order of 10's of μm. Even if we include the sub-membrane cortex, this\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\ndimension only increases to about 100 nm. This tends to favor in-plane stresses over bending\neffects2.\n2. The non-shear deformations are very small with strains of at most a few percent. Therefore,\nlinear analysis is appropriate in many situations. Note, however, that nonlinear effects can be\nimportant, especially for large shear deformations such as occur in micropipet aspiration of\nred blood cells. The implications and limitations of this are discussed more fully below.\n3. The membrane exhibits a very small modulus in plane shear and is often treated as a two-\ndimensional liquid. While this applies primarily to lipid bilayers, when the membrane is\nconsidered to include the cortex, greater values of shear modulus can be observed.\n4. Stresses normal to the membrane are small and can be neglected.\n5. Membrane motions can be damped either due to viscous dissipation within the bilayer as in\nthe case of in-plane shear, or due to the viscosity of the fluids on the intra- or extracellular\nsides of the membrane. These latter are especially important when considering motions of\nthe membrane perpendicular to its plane.\n6. Inertial effects can be neglected due to the predominance of viscous forces during transient\ndeformations.\n\nWith these in mind, and acknowledging the limitations of a continuum view of such\nstructures, we treat the membrane as a thin, homogeneous plate or membrane in which all the\nfollowing must be considered: in-plane extension and shear, bending, viscous damping, and\nthermal fluctuations.\nThe equations we derive will effectively be integrated through the membrane thickness so\nthat stresses will be in terms of surface forces (force / unit length). These are the in-plane normal\nforces (see Fig. 3.1.8 for definition of the axes and nomenclature) are therefore written as\n\n+ h/ 2\nNα = ∫σα dx3\n(2.10)\n- h/ 2\n\nwhere h is the membrane thickness, and the vertical shearing forces:\n\n+ h /2\nVα =\n\n(2.11)\n- h ∫τα 3dx3\n/2\n\nThe moments acting on the plate edges can be calculated from\n\n2 Whether tension or bending dominates clearly depends on the nature of the experiment. If an initially spherical\ncell is distended, tension is most important; if the cell shrinks so that the membrane buckles, bending effects will be\ncritical.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\n+h/ 2\nMαβ = ∫ x3ταβ dx3\n\n(2.12)\n-h/ 2\n\nx\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 3.1.8.

(Note that Q is used to represent shear\nstress in the figure whereas V is used in the text, and (x,y,z) should be (x1,x2,x3).)\n\nIn order to distinguish the effects of bending from those giving rise to extension, we separate the\nnormal stress into two parts, one representing the mean over the thickness of the membrane,\nwhich is simply Nα/h, and the other representing the deviation from this value, denoted as σα′ .\nSimilarly, we separate the displacement on the neutral plane, unα from that which varies with x3,\ndenoted as uα′ .

Setting the sum of forces in the\nx1 direction equal to zero, we obtain (referring to Fig. 3.1.9):\n\n- N1(x1) + N1(x1 + dx1)cosθ (x1 + dx1) - N21 (x2) + N21(x2 + dx2) = 0\n\n(2.24)\n\nor\n\n∂N1\n∂N21\n∂N2\n∂N\n\n+\n= 0\nand similarly\n+\n12 = 0\n\n(2.25)\n∂x1\n∂x2\n∂x2\n∂x1\n\nWhile formidable in its complete form, it is reassuring to know that we rarely use eqn.\n(2.23) in its entirety, and that when certain limiting cases are considered, more familiar equations\nare obtained. It is useful, at this stage, to consider several of these limits.\n\nFig. 3.1.9. x1 force balance in the plane of the membrane.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nBalance between pressure and surface tension (Laplace's Equation). If the in-plane stress is\nuniform (Ni=Nj=N), eqn. (2.23) has the form:\n\n⎛ ∂ 4u\n∂ 4u\n∂ 4u ⎞\n⎛ ∂ 2u\n\nKB ⎜\n4 + 2\n2 +\n4 ⎟ - N⎜\n∂ 2u\n2 +\n3 ⎞\n2 ⎟ - p = 0 ,\n\n(2.26)\n⎝ ∂x1\n∂x1 ∂x2\n∂x2 ⎠\n⎝ ∂x1\n∂x2 ⎠\n\nand eqn. (2.25) is trivially satisfied. If, in addition, bending stiffness can be neglected, then\n\n⎛ ∂\n2 u\n∂\n⎞\n⎛ 1\n1 ⎞\n\nu\np = -N⎜\n2 +\n2 ⎟ ≅ N⎜\n+\n⎟ ,\n(2.27)\n⎝ ∂x1\n∂x2 ⎠\n⎝ R2\nR1⎠\n\nfor small curvatures, where R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the membrane about the x1 and\nx2 axes, respectively. This is the well-known Laplace's equation with N the surface tension. For\na sphere, R1 = R2 and the equation simplifies further, yielding the equation given on p. 10.\n\nBalance between pressure and bending. Alternatively, if all in-plane stresses can be neglected,\nother than those associated with bending stiffness, we obtain the equation generally used for\nsimple bending of plates and shells:\n\n⎛ ∂ 4u\n∂ 4u\n∂ 4\n\nu ⎞\nKB ⎜\n4 + 2\n+\n3 ⎟= p\n\n(2.28)\n⎝ ∂x1\n∂x1 ∂x\n∂x\n2 ⎠\n\nBoth of these forms will be used later in this chapter to examine specific problems in cell\nmembrane mechanics.\nThe conditions under which eqn. (2.26) can be reduced to either (2.27) or (2.28) can be\ndetermined by an order of magnitude comparison of the bending and tension terms. If we take u\nto be a measure of the membrane displacement in the x3 direction and λ to be the characteristic\nlength in the x1 or x2 directions over which u3 varies, then the bending term can be shown to scale\nas K\nBu / λ and the tension term as Nu / λ . The ratio of these tells us which of the terms\ndominate in eqn. (2.26). If\n\nKBu / λ\nK\n=\nB << 1\nNu / λ2\nNλ2\n\nthen tension dominates and eqn. (2.27) is appropriate. Alternatively, if\n\nKB >> 1\nNλ2\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nthen bending dominates, and eqn. (2.28) should be used. If we take values typical of those given\nfor cells: K\nN = 5x10-5\nB = 10-18 N.m,\nN/m, λ = 1 μm; this ratio equals 0.02, confirming, as we\noriginally postulated, that tension tends of dominate.\n\nNonlinear formulations\nTraditionally, membrane deformations have been addressed through nonlinear analysis, allowing\nfor large strains, especially in shear. Here we have chosen to present the linearized equations in\nthe hope that they will provide clearer insight, and for continuity with the approach used in other\nchapters of the text. For many problems of interest, deformations are small and linear theory is\nsufficiently accurate. In some circumstances, however, a nonlinear analysis is necessary, one\nexample being the aspiration of a red blood cell membrane into a micropipet. For this reason, we\npresent the nonlinear equations in Appendix A for the more advanced reader and to assist in\nreading the recent literature on membrane mechanics.\n\nEnergies of deformation\nAlthough the formulation of the equations of deformation in Section 3.1.6 is complete by itself,\nan alternative approach is often useful in which we consider the strain energy, the energy stored\nin the membrane due to elastic deformation, as a basis for analysis. Strain energy is analogous to\nthe energy stored in a spring by stretching it. If the spring is linear with a stiffness k, so that the\nforce F required to lengthen it from x0 to x is k(x-x0), then the energy expended during the\nprocess of lengthening is\n\nx\nx\n\nU = ∫Fdx = ∫ k(x - x0)dx = 1\n2 k(x - x0)\n(2.29)\nx= x 0\nx = x 0\n\nExtensional energy. Now consider a section of an elastic membrane of thickness h and lengths\ndx1 and dx2 subjected to a uniaxial tension stress σ1. Here, as in our previous discussion, we\nconsider two cases, first a flat membrane which is being stretched by extensional stresses (the\ncase at zero temperature), and second, the situation in which the surface area of the membrane\nprojected onto a flat plane, increases due to the smoothing of out-of-plane undulations (the\nentropic contribution).\nAs the stress is gradually applied, to minimize any dissipative effects, the work done by\nthe external force must equal the gain in elastic energy stored in the plate. The work performed\nby this stress is\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nε1\nε 1\n\ndU = ∫σ 1dε 1dx1dx2 dx3 = ∫ Eε1dε1dx1dx2dx3\n\n(2.30)\n\nBy energy conservation, the work done in stretching the membrane must be stored, as potential\nor strain energy in the elastic member. Since the right-hand-side of (3.30) represents the strain\nenergy in the volume dx1dx2dx3, then the energy per unit volume of membrane is\n\nε1\nε1\n\nU0 = ∫ σ 1dε1 = ∫ Eε\n= 1 Eε\n1dε1\n(2.31)\n\nor, expressed as energy per unit area of membrane:\n\nEhε2\n\nU\n0h =\n\n(2.32)\n\nIn the somewhat more general case of biaxial strain, a similar approach leads to\n\nEh\n⎡\n(\n2 )\nEh\n⎛\n⎤\n∂u ⎞\nu\nε1 +ε 2 =\n⎢⎜\n⎛ ∂\n\n⎟ + ⎜\n2 ⎞\nU0h =\n⎟ ⎥\n(2.33)\n2 1( - ν)\n2 1( -ν ) ⎢⎝ ∂x\n⎣\n1 ⎠\n⎝ ∂x2 ⎠ ⎥⎦\n\nNote that if the strain is isotropic in that ε1 = ε2 = ε, this can also be expressed in terms of the\nareal strain with the aid of eqn. (2.3)\n\nEh\n⎛ ΔA⎞\n\nU0h =\n⎜\n⎟ ,\n\n(2.34)\n4 1( - ν) ⎝ A0 ⎠\n\nfrom which it can be seen by eqn. (2.4) that the area expansion modulus has the form:\n\nEh\n\nKe =\n\n(2.35)\n2 1( - ν)\n\nunder the assumptions of a homogeneous, isotropic elastic membrane. This term, however, only\naccounts for the contribution to extensional energy associated with an increase in the surface area\nof a membrane. Another contribution arises from the change in the membrane surface area\nprojected onto the x1-x2 plane, due to non-uniform displacements perpendicular to the plane of\nthe membrane, in the x3 direction. This can be seen from the following one-dimensional\nexample.\nConsider a membrane, tethered at both ends that exhibits a constant surface tension N\nwhen deformed into a new state defined by u3(x1). Locally, the change in length of a segment,\ninitially of length dx is:\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\n(\ndx ) + (\n\ndu3) -dx =[1\ndu3 dx1)\n2]\n1/2\n+ (\ndx\n1 -dx1 ≈(1+ 2 (du3 dx1) )dx1 -dx1 = 2 (du3 dx ) dx\n(2.36)\n\n[see also Figs. 6.4 and 6.5 in Boal] The strain is then the change in length over the initial length,\nor:\n\nε11 = 1\n2 (du3 dx1)\n\n(2.37)\n\nand the energy per unit area associated with this change in length under a constant tension N is\n\nε\nN ⎛∂u ⎞\nU0h = N1∫dε =\n⎜\n3⎟\n(2.38)\n2 ⎝∂x1 ⎠\n\nwhich, extending to two dimensions, can be written:\n\n⎡⎛\n⎞\n⎛\n2⎤\nN ∂u3\n∂u ⎞\nU\n⎢⎜\n⎟+ ⎜\n0h =\n⎟⎥\n(2.39)\n2 ⎢⎝∂x1 ⎠\n⎝∂x\n⎣\n2 ⎠⎦ ⎥\n\nIt is important to recognize that we now have two expressions associated with the energy of\nextension, and they represent two distinct phenomena. The first [eqn. (3.33)] describes the\nenergy associated with true areal expansion; that is, a change in the effective spacing between the\nmolecules comprising the lipid bilayer. The second [eqn. (3.39)] corresponds to the energy\nchange due to undulations in a membrane with constant intermolecular spacing. To see the\ndistinction between the two, consider an experiment in which the pressure inside a cell or a lipid\nvesicle is gradually increased by aspiration into a micropipette. Initially, the projected area of\nthe membrane rises rapidly with a relatively small increase in membrane tension, corresponding\nto the smoothing of undulations caused by thermal excitation of the membrane. This is followed\nat higher tensions by a transition to a regime in which the membrane exhibits a much greater\nstiffness, corresponding to the situation in which the thermally-induced undulations have been\nsmoothed out, and the true membrane surface area now must increase. In the absence of thermal\nfluctuations, e.g., at zero temperature, only this second regime would be observed. [see also\nfigure from Boal]\n\nEnergy of shear deformation. Next examine the energy per unit area associated with shear\ndeformation in the plane of the membrane, which can be expressed in the form:\n\nGh ⎛∂ u1\n∂u2 ⎞\n\nU0h = 2 hτ12ε12 = 2 hGε12 =\n⎜\n+\n⎟\n(2.40)\n2 ⎝∂x2\n∂x1 ⎠\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nwhere we have utilized eqns. (2.8) and (2.9) to obtain a form similar to that of eqn. (2.34) for\nextensional deformation.\n\n[See Boal for an alternative form in terms of membrane curvature. He also gives a nice\ndescription of bending in bilayer membranes.]\n\nBending energy. The contribution due to bending energy is somewhat more difficult to derive.\nFirst, recognize that only those normal stresses that vary with x3 contribute to the bending\nenergy; that is, those contributed by the σ' stresses in eqn. (2.13). With this in mind, we can\nwrite the expression for the total elastic energy due to bending as:\n\nU = ∫∫∫\n⎧\n[\n⎨\n( )\n⎫\nσ 1 ′ + (\n)\nσ 2 ′\n+ 2νσ 1 ′σ ′ 2 ] +\n(\n)\nτ 12 ′\n⎬dx\n\n(2.41)\n⎩2E\n2G\n⎭\n1dx2dx3\n\nSubstituting for the stresses and strains from eqns. (2.15)-(2.17), this can be re-cast in the\nfollowing form:\n\n⎧\n2 ⎫\nK\n⎛\n∂ 2\n2u\n⎡\nu\n∂\n⎞\n∂ 2u\n∂ 2\n⎤\n∂ u\n⎛\nu ⎞\n\nU =\nB ∫∫ ⎜\n3 ⎟\n1 -ν )\n-⎜\n3 ⎟\n⎨\n2 +\n- 2(\n⎬dx1dx\n\n(2.42)\n⎢\n⎥\n⎝ ∂x1\n∂x2 ⎠\n∂x1 ∂x2\n⎝ ∂x1∂x2 ⎠\n⎩\n⎣\n⎦⎭\n\nIt can be shown ((Meleard 1998)) that the integral of the second term in the integrand above [the\none multiplied by 2(1-ν)] is globally constant under deformation if the membrane remains a\nclosed surface with no holes. Assuming that to be the case, we obtain for the total bending strain\nenergy,\n\nKB\n⎛\n∂ 2u\n∂ 2\n\n=\n∫∫⎜\nu\n2 +\n3 ⎞\nU\n⎟\ndx1dx2 + const\n\n(2.43)\n⎝ ∂x1\n∂x2 ⎠\n\nSince we typically are concerned with changes in energy, the constant will arbitrarily be set to\nzero. Thus, the energy per unit area, or energy density of bending deformations, can be written,\n\nK ⎛ ∂ 2\n∂ 2\n⎞\n\n0 =\nB\nu\n⎜\nu\nU h\n2 +\n2 ⎟\n(2.44)\n2 ⎝ ∂x1\n∂x2 ⎠\n\nNote that the term in parentheses is proportional to the mean curvature of the surface. Often, the\nsurface has a natural mean curvature in the unstressed state. If that curvature is c0, the bending\nenergy expression is modified slightly to the form:\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nK ⎛ ∂ 2\n∂ 2\n⎞\n\nU0 =\nB\nu\n⎜\nu\nh\n2 +\n2 - c0⎟\n(2.45)\n2 ⎝ ∂x1\n∂x2\n⎠\n\nAnother common form of this expression is obtained by recognizing that the first two terms in\nparentheses represent the linearized form of the sum of the principal curvatures (the largest and\nsmallest curvatures at a point), denoted c1 and c2, so that eqn. (3.45) can be written:\n\nK\nU\nB\n0h =\n(c1 + c2 - c0 )\n\nAlthough each of these expressions for strain energy density has been derived individually, they\nof course all contribute in the general situation and are linearly additive. In that regard, several\npoints are worthy of note. First, one can obtain some idea of the relative importance of\nextension, shear, and bending deformations in a given situation simply by comparing their\nrelative energies, just as was done in the last section by comparison of the bending and tension\nterms in eqn. (2.26). Not surprisingly, the comparison leads to the same expressions we obtained\nbefore for when either bending or tension is dominant. Second, due to the small shear modulus\nof most cell membranes, the energy stored in shear deformation can generally be neglected. And\nfinally, a comment is warranted concerning the energy due to tension. Various simplifying\nassumptions can be made, depending on the cell type being considered and the nature of the\nstress to which the cell (or vesicle) is being subjected, but generally the lipid bilayer can be\nconsidered to be of constant area unless it experiences grossly non-physiologic levels of stress.\nThus, the main contribution to extensional energy is that represented by eqn. (3.39), associated\nwith the smoothing of membrane undulations.\n\nOther Factors Influencing Membrane Motion\nThermal fluctuations. Biological membranes of all types can be seen to fluctuate due to\nBrownian motion of the surrounding molecules, if viewed with sufficient resolution. These\nfluctuations are, in fact, often used to measure the membrane bending stiffness since thermal\neffects are seen as motions in the membrane of relatively long wavelength, favoring bending\nenergies as compared to extensional or shear (see eqn. (2.23)). To account for these effects, it is\ncustomary to add a time-dependent forcing term to eqn. (2.23), η(t), the magnitude of which\nscales with kBT. We analyze thermal motions later, and use them as a means of determining the\nbending stiffness of a membrane.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nDamping due to external fluids. When a membrane fluctuates in a direction perpendicular to its\nplane, velocities are induced in the surrounding fluids and, due to the resulting shear stresses,\nenergy is dissipated. These motions are extremely complex to model precisely, and depend on\nboth the nature of the surrounding medium (its rheological properties) and the bounding\ngeometry. In lieu of a complete and rigorous analysis, a local damping term is sometimes added\nto the membrane force balance equation (eqn. (2.23)) to approximate these effects. Its form is\nbased on the presumption that externally induced velocities scale with the velocity of the wall,\nand that shear forces in the external fluid scale with the induced shear rates and velocities.\nAccordingly, eqn. (2.23) is modified by the addition of a term of the form μm ∂u3 ∂t where μμ is\nthe effective viscosity of the external fluid. The equation that results from the addition of both\nthermal forcing and external fluid viscosity is:\n\n∂u\n⎛ ∂ 4\nu\n∂ u\n∂\n+\n∂ 4u ⎞\n∂⎛\n⎞\n∂⎛\n⎞\nB ⎜\n∂u\nu\nμm\nK\n4 + 2\n2 +\n4 ⎟ -\n⎜ N\n3 ⎟ -\n∂\n⎜ N\n∂t\n⎝ x\n∂x ∂x\n∂x ⎠\n∂x ⎝\n∂x ⎠\n∂x ⎝\n⎟= p + η(t) (2.46)\n∂x2 ⎠\n\nAn expression of similar form for a linear polymer is sometimes referred to as the Rouse\nequation.\n\n3.1.4 Measurements of Membrane Elastic Parameters\n\nAlthough the analogy has limitations, it is useful at the onset to think of the cell as a fluid-filled\nballoon or bag. Just as in the case of a balloon, the elastic properties of the membrane can be\ndetermined by any experiment in which the membrane tension changes while its area is\nmeasured. In the simple example of a spherical balloon, tension can be computed from the\ninflating pressure and the measured radius, the latter also yielding the surface area. Ignoring for\nnow the thermal-induced fluctuations in a real cell membrane (ie., assuming the cell to be at zero\ntemperature), the calculations become particularly simple. Furthermore, we will consider cells\nfor which the cytoplasm can be considered to fluid-like having no elasticity. We return to\naddress both issues shortly.\nOsmotic swelling\nPerhaps the simplest method to inflate the cell and measure the membrane elastic properties is to\ncause the cell to swell by changing the osmolarity of the external fluid and simultaneously\nmonitoring the change in cell volume. The change in transmembrane pressure mirrors the\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nchange in osmotic pressure brought about by successive additions of a solute to which the\nmembrane is impermeable. For ions and small molecules, the osmotic pressure π can be\ncalculated from the van't Hoff equation\n\nπ = RT ∑ Ci\n(2.47)\ni\nwhere Ci are the molar concentrations of all solutes to which the membrane is impermeable. For\nlarger molecules such as proteins, their contribution to osmotic pressure is much larger than\nindicted by this equation.\nConsider for example a spherical cell expanded osmotically so that the internal\nhydrostatic pressure, relative to external pressure, is pc. Microscopic examination yields a value\nfor the cell radius, Rc. Using these values in combination with Laplace's law [eqn. (2.27)] gives\nus the tension in this state, and eqn. (2.4) provides its relationship to the extensional modulus:\n\np R\nΔ A\nN =\nc\nc = Ke\n\n(2.48)\nA0\n\nThe observed change in radius allows calculation of ΔA. In practice, identification of the\nreference state at zero pc is problematic due to the presence of thermal fluctuations, but if Ke can\nbe assumed constant for relatively small changes in area, it is possible to extrapolate back to the\nzero-stress state from two measurements at elevated pc. [Example: red blood cell.]\n\nMicropipet aspiration.\nOne of the first methods used to measure the extensional modulus of the cell membrane involved\ndrawing a cell, slightly deflated, into a micropipet, simultaneously monitoring the dimensions of\nthe cell and the pressure in the micropipet (Daily, Elson et al. 1984). Since, on the time scale of\nthe experiment, the volume of the cell could be assumed constant, the shape change due to\naspiration of the cell causes increases in both internal pressure and surface tension, both of which\nare assumed spatially uniform. Once the tension is large enough (or the temperature low\nenough) to dampen the amplitude of any thermal fluctuations, the cell can be treated assuming\nthat membrane extension is the dominant means by which the pressure drop across the\nmembrane is balanced. [For further discussion on the thermal fluctuations and the relationship\nbetween micropipet pressure and intracellular pressure, see Daily, and Evans and Rawicz, Phys\nRev, 1990. See also figure on p. 199 of Boal. Example: the two regimes in membrane stiffness.]\n\nFor the situation shown in Fig.xx, the cell is drawn into the micropipet to the point at\nwhich the portion of the cell external to the cell is spherical, of radius Rc. With the assumptions\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nstated above, the (uniform) pressure within the cell can be related to it surface tension (assumed\nuniform) and the radii of curvature of the main body of the cell, Rc, and the portion inside the\npipet, a, using Laplace's law [eqn. (2.27)]:\npc = 2N / Rc = -Δp + 2N / a\n\n(2.49)\nwhere pressures are referenced to the external, ambient pressure. Reorganizing to solve for\nsurface tension we obtain:\nΔp\nN =\n(2.50)\n⎛1\n1 ⎞\n2⎜\n-\n⎟\n⎝a\nRc ⎠\nThe surface area corresponding to a given N is obtained from geometry, summing the membrane\nsurface areas of the cylinder and hemisphere inside the micropipet, and the truncated spherical\nsurface outside yielding, for the areal strain the approximate expression:\n[(a /R )\n2 (a /R )\nΔ\nc\n-\nc\n≅\n]ΔL\nA\nA\n2a\n\nFig. xx Micropipet aspiration of a neutrophil.\n\nThis relationship between N and ΔA/A can be used to calculate the area expansion modulus,\nEh\nA\nK\ne =\n= N\n2 1( -ν)\nΔA\nwhere the expression involving Young's modulus assumes the membrane to be isotropic and\nhomogeneous. The relationship could, however, be non-linear in that the value of Ke may vary\nwith the degree of area expansion; a linear relationship between N and ΔA yields a constant value\nfor Ke.\nIt is important to note that neither of these approaches, osmotic inflation or micropipet\naspiration provides us with any information on the bending modulus. To be precise, bending\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\ndoes play a role in the micropipet experiments, but the effects are so small as to be negligible and\nare typically ignored. That is not to say that bending is always negligible, however, as discussed\nnext.\n\nMonitoring thermal fluctuations in the membrane.\nWhen a cell or lipid vesicle is observed floating free, unattached to a substrate, it can be seen to\nexhibit time-dependent undulations as a result of collisions with the surrounding molecules\nundergoing thermal motion. In the case of a lipid vesicle with diameter in the range of 10\nmicrons, these undulations can be readily observed microscopically. In smaller cells such as red\nblood cells, the motions can be inferred from the flickering phenomenon associated with the light\ninterference as the cell thickness changes (Zeman, Engelhard et al. 1990). Since the amplitude of\nthe membrane undulations depends on the stiffness of the membrane to bending, and its surface\ntension, it is reasonable to expect that measures of this amplitude can be used to infer the\nmembrane elastic parameters. In order to illustrate the method, while avoiding some of the\nalgebraic complexity, consider undulations in a flat membrane with significant bending stiffness\nand a constant surface tension. The relationship between the motion and the elastic properties\ncan be found by considering the total energy of the membrane, obtained by summing the\nenergies per unit area from eqns. (2.39) and (2.44) and integrating over the membrane surface\narea Am:\n\n⎧\n⎪ K ⎛\n∂ 2 u\n∂ 2\n⎡\n\nu ⎞\nN ⎛ ∂u ⎞\n⎛\n∫\n∂u ⎞ ⎤⎫\nB\n⎪\nU0hdA = ∫⎨\n⎜\n2 +\n2 ⎟ +\n⎢⎜\n⎟ + ⎜\n⎟ ⎥⎬dA\n\n(2.51)\nA\n⎠\nm\nAm ⎪ 2 ⎝ ∂x1\n∂x2\n⎢⎝ ∂x1 ⎠\n⎝ ∂x2 ⎠ ⎥⎪\n⎩\n⎣\n⎦⎭\n\nIn writing the energy in this form, we have omitted the contribution due to shear deformation,\nconsistent with the fluid-like character of a pure lipid bilayer, and have taken the surface tension\nto be uniform during the deformation. In this example, membrane surface area changes only as a\nresult of fluctuations from the mean [u3(xx,x2) = 0] configuration; that is, we now ignore the\ncontribution due to changes in intermolecular spacing and only consider changes in the area\nprojected onto the x1-x2 plane.\n\nIt is convenient to use the method of Fourier transforms to represent the undulations of a\nmembrane normal to the x1-x2 plane, which in two-dimensions leads to [see also class notes on\nbending of cytoskeletal filaments; alternatively, use Fourier series representation]:\n\nA\n\nA\nu3 ( x) = u3 (x1, x2) =\n2 ∫ exp(iq ⋅ x)b(q)dq =\n2 ∫ exp(iq\n\n1x1)exp(iq2 x2)b(q1,q2)dq1dq\nπ\n4π\n(2.52)\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\nwhere qα = 2π /λα is the wavenumber of the particular mode and b(q) is the continuous\n\nanalogue of the discrete coefficients that multiply each mode in a Fourier series representation.\nHere the algebra gets complicated, so only the results of the analysis will be presented, however\nthose wishing to see a more complete derivation should see (Boal, Mechanics of the Cell,\nCambridge University Press, 2002).

We do so, however,\nbetween specified limits on the assumptions that the range of possible wavenumbers is restricted\nby the size of the membrane on one hand (q = (π/A1/2)) and the distance between individual lipid\nmolecules on the other (q = π/lm). Integrating between these limits results in:\n\n⎛ π 2\nN ⎞\n∫\ndx\n2 +\nA\n⎜\n⎟\n-\nk T\nl\nK\n=\nB\nln⎜\nm\nB ⎟\n(2.58)\nA\n8πKB\n⎜ π 2\nN ⎟\n⎜\n+\n⎟\n\n⎝ A\nKB ⎠\n\nIf we use the area reduction at zero tension as a reference, and increase the area from that\ncondition by progressively increasing membrane tension, as in a typical experiment, we finally\nobtain an expression relating the change in area to the change in tension\n\n⎛\nNA ⎞\n\n1 +\nA\ndx\nA\ndx\nΔA\n-∫\n-\n⎟\nk\n⎛\nNA\n\n∫\nk\n⎜\n≡\n-\n=\nBT\nπ 2 K\nln ⎜\nB\nT\n⎞\n2 ⎟ ≅\nB\nln 1 +\n(2.59)\nNl\n⎜\n⎟\nA\nA\nA\n8π KB\n⎜ 1 +\nm ⎟\n8π KB\n⎝\nπ 2 KB ⎠\nN = 0\nN\n⎜\n⎟\n⎝\nπ K ⎠\n\nB\n\nwhere we have used the assumption, supported by typical values found from different\nexperiments, that (Nl2\nm ) /(π 2KB ) << 1.\n\nYou should recall, that this solution was obtained on the assumption that the actual area\nof the membrane remained constant, and that the reduction in projected or apparent area resulted\nfrom the undulations being progressively smoothed out. Once the undulations are eliminated,\nthe only means by which the projected area of the membrane can further increase is by an\nincrease in the inter-molecular spacing - an increase in the actual membrane area. When this\noccurs, we expect to see a transition to the behavior discussed at the beginning of this chapter, a\nresult expressed as:\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\nFig. yy. Plots of tension vs. normalized surface area for lipid\nvesicles of different composition. Evans & Rawicz, 1990\n\nΔA\nN\n=\n\n(2.60)\n\nA\nKe\n\nThus we have two limiting predictions, one for low tensions, eqn. (2.59), and another for high\ntensions, eqn. (2.60), and the transition from one behavior to the other should occur when the\ntwo expressions for ΔA/A are of the same magnitude. This is supported by experiment (Fig. yy)\nand the results in the two regimes provide a means for estimating the two moduli, Ke and KB.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\nBefore leaving this analysis, there is one further result that is useful to state, although the\nderivation is, again, somewhat involved. Once we have the solution for the undulations at a\ngiven level of tension and for given membrane properties, the ensemble average displacement\nnormal to the plane of the membrane can also be computed, with the result:\n\n⎞\nu2\nk\n⎛\n=\nBT\nNA\nln ⎜ 1+\n⎟\n(2.61)\n4πN ⎝\nπ 2KB ⎠\n\nAgain, this supports our intuition that the undulations will be suppressed at low temperature or\nhigh tension. And in the limit as N → 0, a binomial expansion of the natural log term shows that\nthe effect of tension drops out, and the magnitude of the undulations varies inversely with the\nbending stiffness.\n\n3.1.5 Membrane Fluid Mechanics\n\nEarly studies of protein diffusion, notably the work of Saffman (Saffman 1976),\nexamined protein diffusion using an approach akin to that of Einstein in three dimensional space,\nthereby reducing the problem to one of solving for the mobility b in the equation for diffusivity:\n\nD = kBTb\n\n(2.62)\n\nCalculation of the mobility is influenced by the viscous drag on the portion of the protein within\nthe membrane, but also on to the intra- and extracellular domains as well. The solution of\ninterest here is the one applicable in the limit of small μe/μm where μe and μm are the external and\nmembrane viscosities, respectively, leading to:\n\nkBT ⎛\nhμ m ⎞\nD =\n⎜-γ + ln\n⎟\n(2.63)\n4πμmh ⎝\naμ e ⎠\n\nwhere h is the membrane thickness, a the radius of the protein (assumed cylindrical) and γ is\nEuler's constant (=0.5772). Membrane viscosity has been estimated from lipid diffusion to be\n~2 poise (McCloskey and Poo 1984). When finite mobility is achieved as a result of a finite\ndomain as, for example, a circle of radius R, the corresponding result is:\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nk\n⎛\nD =\nBT\nR\n⎞\nlog\n-\n\n(2.64)\n4πμh ⎝\na\n2 ⎠\n\nWhile this represents a useful point of departure, measurements of lateral diffusion in a\nmembrane have demonstrated a more complex behavior. Fluorescence recovery after\nphotobleaching (FRAP) has enabled the direct tracking of membrane proteins labeled with\nfluorescent antibodies. More recently, single particle tracking methods have been developed\nusing colloidal gold or a fluorescent particle in conjunction with digital microscopy, as well as\ncontrolled movements using microbeads manipulated by an optical trap.\nFrom experiments such as these, a new picture has emerged. While the lateral diffusion\nof lipids and a small fraction of trans-membrane proteins satisfy the general form of Saffman's\npredictions, the predicted diffusivity is greater than that observed experimentally and agrees with\nexperiments only when a membrane viscosity of 100 poise is used. This might be due to the\npresence of other proteins in the membrane (Kucik, Elson et al. 1999). Experiments also show\nthat many proteins appear to diffuse freely only in small domains typically measuring from 200\n600 nm, remaining confined to these domains for periods on the order of tens of seconds. To\nexplain this behavior, the membrane skeleton fence model was proposed (Kusumi, Sako et al.\n1993) in which a membrane-associated matrix constrains the movement of proteins outside of\nthe domains defined by the matrix filaments. Diffusion beyond these barrier filaments can occur\neither as a result of random thermal motions of the transmembrane protein, matrix filaments, or\nboth, or by transient breaks in the filaments. Confinement of proteins may play an important role\nin rapid and selective signaling. Rapid, directed motion of membrane-associated proteins has\nalso been observed, and is likely due to active transport by an intracellular, actin- or microtubule-\nbased motor.\n\n3.1.6 Cell Adhesion\n\nThis section deals with how cells adhere to their surroundings, and through these sites of\nadhesion, how they interact with the external world. We begin by summarizing the different\ntypes of adhesion, their functions and the molecules involved. Next, we provide a brief\ndescription of the adhesion complexes found in cells and the role of each type. Then, the\ntheories that provide a quantitative description of adhesion between single receptor-ligand pairs\nare reviewed in the context of the material presented in Chapter xx including the role of thermal\nfluctuations. Through these theoretical models, both the static and dynamic states of adhesion\ncan be explored for single molecule pairs, then for adherent cells. Next we develop the different\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\napproaches that are used to study the adhesion of cells, based either on thermodynamics or\nmechanics. Methods for the measurement of adhesion strength are described, providing\nestimates for the force that a cell can exert on its surroundings. Various examples will be\npresented, but the adherence of leukocytes to the endothelium, and the role of adhesion in cell\nmigration will receive special attention.\n\nFunctions of adhesion\nAdhesion has been found to be an essential process, necessary for a variety of fundamental\ncellular functions.\n- Structural integrity. Adhesion helps to maintain the overall structural integrity of the\ntissue; in muscle, for example, it provides the means of force transmission from the cells\nto the surrounding matrix to allow contraction. In non-contractile cells, it still provides\nthe needed mechanical coupling to the surrounding tissue, necessary for a variety of\ncellular functions.\n- External sensing. Adhesion provides a means by which the cell can sense, and\nsubsequently respond to, its surroundings. Forces transmitted directly to the cell\nmembrane or to the cytoskeleton via transmembrane proteins may trigger a variety of\nbiochemical reactions within the cell as we shall see later, in Chapter 3.3.\n- Migration. Cell-matrix adhesion is an essential element in cell migration; a cell propels\nits way through tissue or along a surface through a process involving adhesion,\ncontraction, and release, also described in Chapter 3.3.\n- Regulation of transport. Sites of cell-cell adhesion are often important in the regulation\nof transport across a cell layer such as in the case of an epithelium or endothelium.\n- Communication. Sites of mechanical coupling often provide a means of cell-cell\ncommunication, as in the case of gap junctions, which offer a pathway for the diffusion\nof ions and small molecules between adjacent cells.\n\nAdhesion molecules\nCells adhere to their surroundings or to an artificial substrate via a wide variety of different\nproteins that can be classified into five major families: integrins, selectins, cadherins,\nimmunoglobulins, and transmembrane proteoglycans (Table 1). In terms of their mechanism of\nattachment to other cells or the external matrix, these can be classified as either homophillic -\nbinding to like molecules, heterophillic - binding to unlike molecules, or those that bind to other\ncells through an extracellular linker molecule.\n\nIntegrins, one of the largest class of adhesion molecules, are primarily used to attach cells\nto the extracellular matrix or the basal lamina, but are also present in some cell-cell adhesion\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\ncomplexes. They typically bind to the matrix via the RGD amino acid sequence (arginine,\nglycine, aspartic acid) but can also contain other binding motifs. Integrins are heterodimers in\nthat they always contain an α and a β subunit, with the different isoforms determining the\nspecific ligand to which the integrin binds. Two specific types of adhesion, focal adhesions and\nhemidesmosomes often contain integrins, and the attachments they make can at times be stable,\nbut at other times transient, so as, for example, to mediate cell migration. The force of adhesion\nof a single integrin-ligand bond has been measured using atomic force microscopy, and found to\nbe in the range of 30-100 pN (Lehenkari and Horton 1999) with a relatively low binding affinity\nin the range of K ~ 10-6\nD\nto 10-8 mol/liter. By comparison, typical cell-surface receptors bind\nwith an affinity in the range of 10-9 to 10-11 mol/liter. Integrins also play an important role in\nsignaling since extracellular integrin binding is known to influence cytoskeletal morphology as\nwell as the state of cell differentiation.\n\nAdhesion molecules in the selectin family also tend to form transient bonds, and are\nimportant in leukocyte adhesion and extravasation, the migration of the leukocyte through the\nendothelium and into the tissue. Consequently, they tend to be found in cells of the circulation,\nand are present both in leukocytes and endothelial cells and are instrumental in adhesion between\nthese two cell-types during leukocyte rolling.\n\nFamily\nLocation and/or\nLigands\nComments\nfunction\nrecognized\nintegrins\nfocal adhesions,\n(E) fibronectin,\nrelatively low\nhemi-desmosomes,\ncollagen, laminin, affinities\nleukocyte\nimmunoglobulins, (KD~ 10-6-10-8\n(\"spreading\")\n(I) actin filaments mol/liter)\nadhesion, primarily\ncell-matrix adhesion\nbut also in some\ncell-cell adhesions\nselectins\ncirculating cells and\ncarbohydrates\nrequire Ca2+\nendothelial cells,\n\"rolling\" adhesion\nIg superfamily\nimportant in\nintegrins,\n\n(immunoglobulin)\nimmune response\nhomophillic\ncadherens\nadherens junctions,\n(E) homophillic,\nrequire Ca2+\ndesmosomes\n(I) actin\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nfilaments,\nintermediate\nfilaments\ntransmembrane\nfibroblasts,\n(E) collagen,\nbind various\nproteoglycans\nepithelial cells\nfibronectin\ngrowth factors\n(I) actin\nsuch as FGF\nfilaments,\nheterophillic\n\nTable 1. Cell adhesion molecules and their characteristics.\n\nWhile both integrin and selectin binding is mediated by Ca2+, adhesion via the\nimmunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of proteins is Ca2+ independent. Some of the most prominent\nmembers of this family are the N-CAMs (Neural cell adhesion molecules) and ICAMs\n(Intracellular cell adhesion molecules). These tend to undergo homophillic bonding, but some\nalso bind to members of the integrin family.\n\nCadherens are often expressed in the same cells as the selectins, but form much stronger\nbonds and therefore play an important role in maintaining cell integrity. Because of these\nattributes, cadherens are the primary adhesion proteins in desmosomes and adherens junctions,\nthe major structural contacts cells form with other cells or the basil lamina. These also form\nhomophillic bonds by a Ca2+ dependent mechanism and mediate selective bonding between\nadjacent cells. Cadherens are relatively short as compared to other adhesion molecules, being\nabout 700-750 amino acid residues in length.\n\nTypes of adhesion complexes\nCells have developed a variety of specialized adhesion complexes, each utilizing one or more of\nthe adhesion molecules of Table 1 and each serving a specific purpose. Typically, the cell-cell or\ncell-surface spacing is in the range of 10-20 nm, but this is highly variable ranging from less than\n1 nm when controlling transport to over 100 nm in regions where tight control is unnecessary.\nBelow we describe the different types of junctions and, where important for function, their\nmechanical characteristics.\n\nGap junctions. Cells need to communicate with their neighbors for a variety of reasons. For\nexample, cardiac myocytes transmit signals from cell to cell in order to maintain a synchronous\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nwave of contraction. This is typically accomplished by providing a pathway for ions and small\nsignaling molecules between cells called gap junctions (Fig. 3.1.10). These minute channels are\ntypically comprised of a collection of six connexin proteins that cluster together in cylindrical\nfashion, forming a minute channel that passes molecules and ions less than about 1200 to 2000\nMW (1.5-2 nm). Transport through these channels is regulated and their permeability drops in\nthe presence of high Ca2+ concentration, as when a cell membrane is ruptured, or with low pH.\nCyclic AMP, acting as a second messenger, can be exchanged between cells, therefore gap\njunctions provide a metabolic linkage between neighboring cells and provide a means by which\nhormonal stimulation of just one cell can be transmitted to others.\n\nAdherens junctions. Adherens junctions are belt-like structures that can be though of as the\nstructural \"weld\" that holds two cells together (Fig. 3.1.10). Because of their structural role,\nthese junctions formed by homophilic bonding between proteins in the cadheren family are\nanchored securely, again via the adaptor proteins, α, β, γ-catenin, to the cytoskeleton.\n\nDesmosomes and Hemidesmosomes. If the adherens junctions are the continuous welds between\ncells, desmosomes are the \"spot welds\". Again, these serve primarily a structural purpose,\njoining two neighboring cells via a complex consisting of a dense plaque on the intracellular\nsides of both cells extending 15-20 nm into the cell and consisting of a variety of proteins that\nattach to keratin filaments, part of the intermediate filament network. Hemidesmosomes have\nsimilar intracellular structure, but attach instead to the basal laminae. Based on their different\nextracellular attachment sites, desmosomes typically link to other cells via cadherens whereas\nhemidesmosomes adhere via a type of integrin. Both are commonly found in epithelial cells.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\nFig. 3.1.10. Schematic showing the different types of cell junctions present in an epithelial cell\nas found in the small intestine. Tight junctions near the apical surface essentially prevent the\npassage of all molecules. The spot desmosomes and adherens junctions provide for cell-cell\nanchoring, and the hemidesmosomes for anchoring to the basal lamina. Gap junctions provide a\nmeans for communication between neighboring cells.

Adhesion complexes.\n\nFocal adhesions. A second means by which cells attach to the extracellular matrix is through\nfocal adhesions. These serve a similar function to the hemidesmosomes, and share a common\nlinkage via integrins to the ECM, but are attached on the intracellular side instead to the actin\nfilaments of the cytoskeleton. Actin filaments converge at the site of focal adhesions forming\nstress fibers, strong actin bundles that attach to the β-subunit of the integrins via adapter\nproteins such as actinin, vinculin and talin. Focal adhesions are instrumental in cell migration,\nand for this purpose need to be easily formed and disrupted as the cell moves forward. Release\nor de-adhesion of cells is often mediated by a class of peptides called dis-integrins that\ncompetitively bind to the RGD site used by integrins to attach to a variety of matrix molecules.\n\nTight junctions. Control of transport is generally mediated by tight junctions that form an\nintricate network of seams between two cells (Fig. 3.1.11). As their name implies, these are the\ntightest of the cell-cell junctions, and the gaps they leave are often small enough to exclude even\nthe smallest ions and molecules. Formed by homophillic binding between the transmembrane\nproteins occluding and claudins, tight junctions allow epithelial cells to perform their critical role\nin transepithelial transport and provide for maintenance of differences in concentration between\nthe apical and basal surfaces of these cells. Since occludins are not capable of forming rigid,\nstructural bonds with the cytoskeleton, they are most often associated in a junctional complex\nwith adherens junctions or desmosomes that fulfill the structural needs of attachment.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\nFig. 3.1.11. Tight junctions in an epithelial cell, shown schematically (a), in a freeze fracture\nreplica (b), and in a transmission electron micrograph (c). [Reproduced from Alberts, et al,\n1994.]\nFig. 3.1.12. Two types of bond that attach a cell to the extracellular matrix by means of clusters\nof integrins. On the extracellular side, integrins bind to the matrix proteins fibronectin and\nlaminin. Inside the cell, they attach to the cytoskeleton via adaptor proteins to either actin\nfilaments (focal adhesions) or intermediate filaments (hemidesmosomes). [Reproduced from\nLodish, et al., Molecular Cell Biolology, 2000]\nNon-specific binding.\nCells can adhere to their surroundings by either non-specific or receptor-ligand (specific)\nbonding. Though both mechanisms are likely active in most situations, as we will see, receptor\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nligand bonding is the stronger of the two, by a considerable margin, and is therefore the most\nrelevant biologically. In situations for which either the receptors or their ligands are not present,\nhowever, such as might be the case in certain in vitro experiments, non-specific binding can be\nimportant as well.\nThere are essentially three major forms of non-specific attractions to consider:\n\n- Van der Waals - These attractive forces arise due to charge interactions in polar\nmolecules. They tend to dominate among the non-specific mechanisms at\nintermediate distances, around 20-25 nm. [see Boal]\n- Electrostatic - These interactions can be either attractive or repulsive, depending\non the sign of the surface charges, and are particularly important during the\napproach of two cells since the glycocalyx has a high negative charge density.\n- Steric - These forces arise due to the steric exclusion of two molecules as they are\nbrought into close contact. In the case of cell-cell interactions, steric repulsion is\ndue to the compression of the two glycocalyx layers and the tendency to resist\ncompression resulting from osmotic effects and the elasticity of the layer. Steric\nforces tend to dominate for small separation distances < 10 nm.\n\nIn combination, these effects combine to produce a net attractive force per unit area of\nabout 100 Pa at a separation distance of about 25 nm.\n\nAdhesion by means of receptor-ligand binding\nWe can use the analysis of Chapter xx to estimate the strength of a receptor-ligand bond, and\nbased on typical values for bond density, calculate the corresponding strength of adhesion\nbetween two cells or between a cell and a surface. Recall that the application of force to a\nreceptor-ligand bond modifies the dissociation rate constant for the binding reaction. This effect\ncan be modeled in several ways, but the result obtained by Bell ((Bell 1978)) suggests the\nfollowing exponential form for the dissociation rate:\n\n⎛ γf ⎞\n⎛\nγσ\n⎞\nk-= k- exp⎜\n⎟ = k- exp⎜\n⎟\n(2.65)\n⎝ kBT ⎠\n⎝ NCkBT ⎠\n\nwhere k\n- is the unforced dissociation rate constant, γ is a factor with the units of length that\ncorresponds roughly with the distance separating the bonded pair at equilibrium, NC is the\nconcentration of bonded complex and σ is the average bond force per unit area. To determine\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nthe rate of change of the concentration of bonded pairs, one must solve the following rate\nequation describing the competition between bond formation (first term) and destruction (second\nterm):\n\ndNC\n⎛\nγσ\n⎞\n≅ k+ (NR - NC )(NL ) - k- NC = k+ (N -\n)(\nR\nNC NL ) - k- NC exp⎜\n⎟\n(2.66)\ndt\n⎝ NCkBT⎠\n\nwhere NR and NL are the concentrations of receptors and ligands, respectively, and we have\nassumed that NC<<NL, and that all bonds are stressed equally. At equilibrium, dNC/dt=0, and if\nthe force applied to detach the cell (equal to the average bond stress, σ) is increased\nincrementally from zero, NC will progressively fall to a new equilibrium value. At sufficiently\nhigh levels of force, however, increasing σ further eventually gives rise to a situation in which\nequilibrium can no longer be achieved through a reduction in NC. At that point, NC tends toward\nzero and the cell separates from the surface to which it was attached. It can be shown that this\noccurs when (Bell 1978)\n\nk\nα c exp(α\n+\nc + 1) =\nN\nk 0\nL\n(2.67)\n-\n\nσ\nwhere α\nminγ\nc ≡\nand σmin is the minimum stress needed to cause detachment. For a wide\nNRkBT\nrange of conditions, eqn. (2.67) has the approximate solution:\n\n⎛ k0\n+\n⎞\nα c ≅ 0.7ln\nL\n(2.68)\n⎜\n0 N\n\n⎟\n⎝ k-\n⎠\n\nso that the critical stress for detachment can be expressed as:\n\nN\nσ\n≅ 0.7\nCkBT\n⎛ k\n⎞\nln⎜\n+\nmin\nN ⎟\n(2.69)\nγ\n⎝ k0\nL\n-\n⎠\n\nwhere NC is determined from setting eqn. (2.66) to zero under these critical conditions.\n\nThermodynamic approach to cell adhesion.\nAlthough we focus here on the mechanical aspects of cell adhesion, this process can also be\nviewed from a thermodynamic perspective. In this approach, adhesion is considered in terms of\nthe change in energy, specifically the Gibbs free energy, G, associated with all the individual\nreceptor-ligand interactions as well as the various non-specific forces of attraction or repulsion.\nThe adhesion of a cell to a given surface, then, can be viewed as an equilibrium state determined\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nby minimization of the free energy. If, in undergoing a transition from a free state to an adherent\nstate, the system represented by the cell and surface experiences a reduction in free energy, ie,\nΔG<0, then adhesion will occur, and the equilibrium state of adhesion will be determined by that\nwith the minimum in free energy, or the largest value of -ΔG. While this approach ignores\nmany of the subtleties of the interactions and, like the analysis above, assumes that all receptor\nligand interactions are identical from an energetic point of view, it is useful in providing some\nsimple insights as seen in the next two examples.\n\nExample: Comparison of specific and non-specific adhesive forces: Non-specific bonding due\nto the combined effects of van der Waals, electrostatic, and steric forces result in an attractive\nstress of approximately 100 Pa. Receptor-ligand bonding give rise to forces that can be\nestimated from the change in free energy f ~\nto 4x10-4 dyn/bond = 9x10-11 to 4x10-9\nΔG/r~9x10-6\n\nN/bond where f is the force required to break the bond and r is a measure of the distance the\nbond stretches before it breaks. Using a typical density of the receptor-ligand complex NC of\n~1012-1015 bonds/m2 , gives a total bond stress of N\nC x f ~ 9 x 10 to 4x106 Pa. The above\nkinetic approach to estimating bond strength [eqn. (2.69)] gives a value approximately half of\nthat from this equilibrium approach. In either case, however, the conclusion remains the same:\nnon-specific binding can, under certain circumstances, be important since it is comparable to the\nlowest estimates of receptor-ligand-mediated bond strength, but, not surprisingly, the latter is\nquite likely to dominate in nearly all practical situations.\n\nExample: JKR theory for the equilibrium area of adhesion between a cell and substrate.\nIt is well known that cells tend to take on a more flattened shape as the substrate to which they\nare attached becomes more strongly adhesive, either by coating with a more attractive ligand or\nby increasing the concentration of ligand bound to the substrate. Conversely, less adhesive cells\nround up and become more spherical. These observations can be explained with the help of a\nsimple scaling analysis, on the assumptions of small deformation of a linear elastic \"cell\".\n\nLet the cell be modeled as a homogeneous elastic sphere with elastic modulus E and\ninitial radius R (Fig. 3.1.13). It is then brought into contact with a surface to which it adheres.\nAs the cell adheres it attains a lower energy state, characterized by an adhesion energy per unit\narea J. Formation of a flat adhesion surface, however, requires deformation within the elastic\ncell and an associated increase in the stored elastic energy.

That analysis has obvious implications to the\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nadhesion of cells to substrates, the surrounding extracellular matrix, and other cells. Here we\nextend that analysis in the specific case of whole cell adhesion. In doing so, it will be important\nto consider such factors as the distribution, type, and density of receptor-ligand bonds or\npotential bonds, and the elastic properties of the structures to which they are anchored. On the\nintracellular side, this involves the series of couplings that link the receptor to the cell. In the\nsimplest case, this might simply be a link to the lipid bilayer if the receptor has no intracellular\nconnections. More typically, especially for couplings with a structural role, it involves a series\nof proteins ultimately linking the receptor to the cytoskeleton.\nThe typical setting in vivo is one in which cells adhere to other cells or to the extracellular\nmatrix. Adhesions are more easily probed, however, through in vitro experiments (described\nbelow) where cell adhesion more often occurs to an artificial substrate mediated through one of\nseveral extracellular proteins that are used to coat the surface. Generally, either collagen or\nfibronectin is used. Cells are often adhered to these substrates, but to produce a more controlled\nenvironment, rigid beads are sometimes coated with the appropriate receptors so that one specific\nreceptor-ligand interaction can be probed. While these systems are useful as models of certain\nadhesion phenomena, it is important to recognize in the interpretation of these experiments, that\nwhen bound to a rigid substrate or bead, the binding proteins cannot freely diffuse, as they would\nin a more natural environment. In particular, the formation of focal adhesions would not occur in\nbead-substrate experiments because the receptors would be constrained from aggregating.\n\nIt is instructive to begin this discussion with a consideration of a single adhesion bond,\nfor example, one linking the actin matrix of the cytoskeleton to a β1 integrin, and the integrin\nreceptor binding to the extracellular matrix beyond the cell membrane (Fig. 3.1.14). If the bond\nis stressed, as for example if the cell experiences a force relative to the ECM, it will at first\nstretch an amount dictated by the level of force in the bond and the stiffness of the complex.\nEach bond, as well as each protein in the bond complex, can be thought of as having a certain\nstiffness, giving rise to a picture in which several springs are considered connected in series.\nForces acting on the adhesion complex are transmitted via this series of bonded proteins between\nthe CSK and the ECM, producing local deformations and stresses in the corresponding matrices\nthat decay with distance from the adhesion site. On the intracellular side, these forces are\ntransmitted via a complex involving vinculin, α-actinin, paxillin and talin. Attachment to the\nextracellular matrix is mediated by an RGD sequence (in fibronectin for example) which in turn,\nhas binding sites for collagen and fibrin. If the force is sufficiently strong, above a certain\nthreshold value F0 say, and applied for a sufficiently long time, the bond might be severed (de\ncouple). Typical values of this threshold force lie in the range of 10-100 pN (Evans and Ritchie\n1997), but depend, as well, on the rate at which the force is increased. Under more rapid\nforcings, the threshold is high compared to when the force is increased slowly. This simply\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nreflects the fact that detachment is a stochastic process and that at any given level of force, there\nexists a finite probability of detachment, and this probability increases with time.\n\nFig. 3.1.14. One type of attachment linking the intracellular actin matrix to the extracellular\nmatrix via an integrin complex that involves, in addition, vinculin, α-actinin, paxillin and talin.\n(Reproduced from Lodish, et al., Molecular Cell Biolology, 2000).\n\nWe need also to consider that, in equilibrium, a fraction Φ = K(1+K)-1 (where K is the\nequilibrium constant) of the receptors will be bound at any given time, and that the receptor\nligand complexes are continually cycling between the bound and unbound states, characterized\nby their respective rate constants.\n\nOn a larger scale, numerous adhesion sites typically act in parallel, each contributing\nsome amount to the total adhesion force. If the force transmitted by each single adhesion\ncomplex is F, and the density of adhesion sites (per unit membrane area) is NC, then the stress\nacting on the cell is the product F NC. This gives a somewhat false impression, however, as it is\nunlikely that each adhesion complex carries an equal force. Put another way, there exists a local\nstress, τ, that can be thought of as the product of the average force per bond times the bond\ndensity. This stress is typically non-uniform. In the adhesion of a cell to a flat substrate, the\nbonds near the periphery of the contact zone determine the strength of the cell against\ndetachment, and when the cell is subjected to a detaching force, the stresses are concentrated in\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nthis peripheral region as depicted in Fig. 3.1.15. In the vicinity of the edge of adhesion, several\nfactors will influence the stress distribution including the mechanical properties of the membrane\n(in particular the bending stiffness, KB), the receptor density, the spring constants of the bond,\nand the bond strength.\n\nN\n\nRegion of adhesion\n\nx1\n\nFig. 3.1.15. Schematic model of a cell membrane being detached from a substrate by application\nof a tension force N. The membrane is free to the left of the dash-dot line, and adherent to the\nright. Forces and moments are transmitted through the membrane which adheres to the\nmembrane through receptor-ligand bonds represented by a continuous distrubution p(x1).\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following simple model for an adherent cell being peeled away\nfrom its substrate by a force that generates a tension, N, in the membrane (Fig. 3.1.15).\nDeformations in the membrane are described by eqn. (2.23) where it can be shown that the\nbending term dominates provided Kb/L2 >N where L is the characteristic length in the x1 direction\n(due to the small length scales involved), and the external membrane force (p in the membrane\nequation), is now the non-uniform stress due to adhesion bonds. As a simple first approximation,\nwe take p = k(δ-δ0) with δ-δ0 being the amount of stretch in the receptor-ligand bond \"springs\"\nand k an effective bond spring constant. Recognizing that p approaches zero far from the edge\n(see Fig. 3.1.9), the membrane displacement and the spring displacement are related: u3 = δ-δ0.\nThus, eqn (2.28) is written:\n\n⎛ ∂\n4 u\n\nKB⎜\n3 ⎞\n4 ⎟ = NC F = NCku\n⎝ ∂x ⎠\n\n(2.77)\n\nThis can be solved directly showing that the distance of separation between the cell membrane\nand substrate grows in an exponential fashion with distance. Even more simply, a scaling\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nanalysis of eqn. (2.77) in which the term on the left is approximated by Kbu3/w4 where w is the\ncharacteristic distance over which u3 varies, tells us that the stresses are concentrated in a region\nof width\n\nK\n\nw ∝\nB\n\n(2.78)\nNCk\n\nnear the cell periphery. Similarly, we can estimate that the cell membrane will detach from the\nsubstrate if N > FoNCw, where F0 is a measure of the force in a single bond at the time of bond\nrupture, and that the rate of peeling can be roughly approximated as the product of the\ndisassociation rate, k -- (bonds/s) from eqn. (2.65) and the distance between bonds (N -1/2\nC\n).\nAlthough this provides some insight into how the peeling rate depends on the various factors, it\nfails to capture the fact that the cell remains in an equilibrium attached state even for non-zero\nlevels of tension, reflecting that even under force, a balance can exist between the rates of\nformation and rupture of receptor-ligand complexes. (Ra, Picart et al. 1999)\nIt is also of interest to note that, in the region near the edge of the attachment zone(x1=0\nin Fig. 3.1.15), the membrane acts as a beam subjected to a moment due to the applied tension.\nThis moment is balanced by a force couple due to tension in the adhesion complexes right\nadjacent to the edge in combination with a compressive stress between the cell and substrate a\nlittle further in. In typical situations, this compressive stress can approach levels as high as one\natmosphere, and can act to effectively smooth the membrane and recruit new attachment sights.\nWhile using these continuum descriptions, it is important to keep in mind the true,\ndiscrete nature of the individual bonds represented in the model as a continuous adhesive\nsurface. This is brought to light by a simple calculation in which the characteristic length over\nwhich the applied tension is supported, w, is compared to the inter-receptor spacing, N -1/2\nC\n.\nUsing typical values for the parameters: NC = 103 complexes.μm-2, k = 10-5 to 10-6 N/m, Kb = 1 to\n2x10-18 Nm, we find that w ≅ 0.1 to 0.3 μm and the inter-complex spacing, N\n-1/ 2\nC\n≅ 0.03 μm.\nWhile it is reassuring to see that w is typically less than the inter-complex spacing, the difference\nis small. It is therefore not surprising that the actual process of cell peeling is stochastic in\nnature, occurring in a sequence of more-or-less discrete steps with a velocity of peeling that\nvaries widely from the mean.\nThe interplay between receptor-ligand bonding and membrane stiffness also determines\nwhether a cell will spread over a surface or peel away from it under a given tension. Membrane\nbending stiffness acts to maintain the membrane and substrate within close proximity near the\nedge of contact (Fig. 3.1.15). Spreading can occur, only if their separation distance is within the\nextended length of the receptor ligand bond over a distance comparable to the linear spacing\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nbetween neighboring bonds ( N\n-1/ 2\nC\n). Under high tension, the surfaces rapidly diverge and\nspreading is prevented; if the tension is sufficiently low, receptor-ligand bonding can occur and\nspreading can occur.\n\nMeasurements of adhesion\nA variety of methods have been used to experimentally determine the strength of adhesion, either\nof individual receptor-ligand bonds or populations of bonds, as in the case of entire cells.\nWhole cell experiments are more common, and typically require less experimental\nsophistication. The drawback, of course, is that they provide only for estimates of average\nproperties and require certain assumptions regarding the distribution of cell-substrate adhesive\nstress for interpretation to the level of a single bond. Several of these methods are described\nnext.\n\nCentrifugal cell adhesion assays. In this experiment, cells are allowed to attached to a substrate,\nthen are placed in a centrifuge rotating at speed, ω, positioned a distance r from the center of\nrotation and oriented so that the net centrifugal force is acting to separate the cell from the\nsubstrate. Using the arrangement shown in Fig. 3.1.16 (right), the acceleration of the cells is\nω r,\nand the net force acting on a cell of volume Vc is F = (ρc -ρf )ω\n2rVc where the fluid and cell\ndensities are ρf and ρc, respectively.\nInterpreting these results, we can make several different assumptions each leading to a\ndifferent estimate for the maximum force experienced by the binding complex. If we simply\nassume that all receptor-ligand complexes support an equal fraction of the total force, F, then the\nforce per bond is f = F / (πa\n2NC ) where NC is the concentration of bond complexes. However,\nas the cell tears away from the substrate, the edge bonds will break first, since these experience\nthe greatest level of force. An alternative approach, then, is to assume that the adhesion\ncomplexes around the cell circumference support the entire load, leading to the estimate\nf = F / 2( πaN\n1/ 2 ) , recognizing that N\n1/ 2\nC\nC is the average distance between bonds. A somewhat\nmore accurate value for f might be obtained if we assume that all complexes within the distance\nw given by eqn. (2.78), support the load. In any of these cases, once the centrifugal force\nexceeds some critical limit, since the number of receptors supporting the load falls as the region\nof contact becomes smaller, the force per bond increases and the cell will rapidly detach.\nStochastic variability also needs to be taken into account, however, since even under a\nconstant load, any single bond has a finite probability of failure under a given level of force. The\nequilibrium state of the cell, then, should be viewed as one in which the rate of bond formation\nequals the rate of bond breakage, with increasing force having the effect of reducing the\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nprobability that the bond will remain intact. These effects can be addressed using the methods\ndescribed in more detail in Chapter xx.\n\nParallel flow assay. Another common method for assessing cell adhesion is to plate the cells\nonto one wall of a parallel flow chamber, subject them to a fluid dynamic shear stress and\nobserve at what flow rate the cells begin to release. If we ignore flow details in the immediate\nvicinity of the cell, the shear stress can be estimated from the solution for a fully developed\n(Poiseuille) velocity profile:\n\n3V ⎡\ny\n⎛ ⎞ ⎤\nv(y) =\n⎢1-\n⎥\n(2.79)\n⎝ ⎠\n⎣ ⎢\nh ⎥⎦\n\nso that the shear stress acting on the cell is\n\n⎛dv ⎞\n6μV\nτw = μ⎜\n⎟\n=\n\n(2.80)\n⎝dy ⎠\nh\ny = -h\n\nand the total force can be estimated as F ≈τwAc where Ac is the surface area of the cell\nmembrane exposed to the flow.\n\nConsider, as an example, a flow of culture medium at a rate of 1 ml/s through a channel\nof height 0.1 cm and width 1 cm. If the culture medium has a viscosity close to that of water,\n(μ=0.01 dyn.s), the shear stress is obtained from eqn. (2.80):\n\n6⋅(0.01dyn ⋅s) ⋅(1ml / s) / ( 0.1⋅1.0cm2)\nτ\ndyn / cm\nw =\n= 6\n= 0.6Pa\n\n0.1cm\n\nThis corresponds roughly with the level of shear stress experience by endothelial cells in the\narterial system. If we consider that the cell has a surface area with dimensions roughly 100 μm x\n10 μm or about 103 μm2, then the total force acting on the cell is obtained by integrating the\nshear stress over the area of the apical membrane. Assuming that the shear stress is uniform, the\nforce is simply the product of shear stress and surface area, or about 1 nN in the present example.\n\nAgain, interpretation of results from such experiments requires careful consideration of\nthe distribution of forces among the individual adhesion complexes. In this situation, the cell is\nlikely to peel from the upstream edge, in much the same manner as occurs in the cell peeling\nexperiment discussed earlier.\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nRadial flow and spinning disk assays. One disadvantage of the parallel flow assay is that all cells\nare subjected to essentially the same level of shear stress, so the flow rate needs to be\nincrementally varied in order to determine the level of force required for detachment. These two\nsystems using an axisymmetric geometry circumvent this problem by producing an easily\ncharacterized radial variation in shear stress. In the case of the radial flow assay, fluid enters\nthrough a central channel and flows radially outward through the narrow gap between two\ncircular plates. From conservation of mass, the mean flow velocity is given by\n\nQ\nV =\n\n(2.81)\n2πrh\n\nand sufficiently far from the center (r>>h), the velocity profile is parabolic as in the parallel\nflow assay, and the shear stress is again governed by eqn. (2.80) using (2.81) for V .\n\nQ\n\nω\n\n(Not to scale.)\n\nv\nh\n\nh\n\nCell layer\nrc\nCe l l layer\n\nrc\n\nr\nr\n\nFig. 3.1.16. Schematic diagram showing the radial flow assay (left) and the spinning disk assay\n(right). In the radial flow assay, shear stress attains a maximum value near the center and falls\nwith increasing radius r, whereas in the spinning disk system, maximum shear stress is\nexperienced at large r.\n\nIn the spinning disk assay, cells are grown on one disk, and the opposite disk is rotated at\nconstant speed. Provided the rate of rotation is sufficiently small that inertial effects can be\nneglected, the velocity is purely in the circumferential direction and the profile is linear between\nthe two plates, so that the shear stress experienced by the cells can easily be computed as\n\nωr\nτw = μ\n\n(2.82)\nh\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nIn both of these cases, as in the parallel flow assay, the total force is obtained by integrating the\nshear stress over the cell surface, and the distribution of force among the adhesion complexes is\nweighted toward those located near the upstream end of the cell. This can also be seen by\nconsideration of the torque exerted by shear stress on the cell that must be balanced by a non\nuniform contact stress with the substrate that is greatest near the upstream end.\n\nSingle bond adhesion assays. Two other assays provide a means of obtaining estimates for the\nstrength of a single adhesion bond without the need for excessive interpretation. These rely on\nan ability to isolate a small number of bonds, or even a single bond, and infer bond strength from\nthe step-wise nature of the de-adhesion process associated with breakage of discrete bonds. One\nof these methods employs the atomic force microscope, coated with the ligand of an adhesion\nreceptor, as shown in Fig. 3.1.17. The probe tip is gradually brought up to the cell surface until\none or more receptor-ligand bonds are formed. When the probe tip is withdrawn, it moves along\na different trajectory on a force-displacement plot, reflecting the forces of adhesion. These\nforces are seen to jump between more or less discrete levels as the probe continues to be moved\naway from the cell, with each jump corresponding to the breakage of a single bond (Fig. 3.1.17).\nUsing this method, the bond strength between integrin receptor and a variety of RGD-containing\nligands was found to lie in the range of 30 to 100 pN (Lehenkari and Horton 1999).\n\nFig. 3.1.17. The strength of a single adhesion bond can be measured by bringing a\nfunctionalized tip of an AFM probe up to the cell, allowing bonds to form, then slowly\nwithdrawing the probe. Monitoring the differences between the force displacement curve\nbetween the forward and reverse motions, the forces necessary to break a single receptor-ligand\nbond can be determined. [Reproduced from (Lehenkari and Horton 1999).]\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\nA second method is similar in that the discrete increments in force are monitored as\nindividual receptor-ligand bonds are broken, but the forces are measured by means of changes in\nthe shape of a giant vesicle the membrane of which contains the ligands have been inserted. In\nthis case, one vesicle is made effectively rigid due, for example, to a high surface tension. A\nsecond vesicle containing the adhesion molecules is also drawn partially into a micropipet, but is\nmuch more complaint than the first. The two vesicles are then brought into point contact so that\none or a small number of adhesions are formed. As the pipets are moved apart, the compliant\nvesicle distorts due to the force of adhesion which, it can be shown, is related to the change in\ndimension of the vesicle in the direction of the force, thereby serving as a sensitive force\ntransducer, measuring forces in the range of single adhesion receptors, or between 1 and 100 pN\n[Evans, 1991 #37].\n\n(For specific examples of leukocyte rolling and attachment see Orsello, or Chang & Hammer)\n\n[This process is initiated, for example, by local infection that causes the release of\nchemotactic agents in addition to cytokines ....\n\nModels of this process draw upon many of the concepts discussed in this chapter. ]\n\nTransient cell adhesion.\n\nConcepts of transient adhesion and release are of particular importance in the case of leukocyte\nrolling, adhesion and transmigration across the endothelial layer of a blood vessel. In addition,\ncell migration through extracellular matrix or along a substrate requires the ability of the cell to\nboth form and release adhesions.\nOne problem that has received considerable attention is the interaction between an\nadherent or rolling leukocyte and the adhesion receptors on the endothelium. These studies are\ncomplicated by the three-dimensional nature of the flow, the compliance of the interacting\nsurfaces, and receptor-ligand dynamics. In a series of recent studies, Hammer and co-workers\n(Chang, Tees et al. 2000) have addressed several of these issues, computing the viscous force\nand torque acting upon a sphere near to planar wall from the mobility matrix (Hammer and Apte\n1992) and using the \"Bell model\" of receptor binding (Bell 1978), but neglecting the effects of\ncell deformation. The Bell model relates the dissociation rate constant, kr to the force in the\nbond, f, the thermal energy, kBT, and a parameter with units of length that depends on the\nreactivity of the molecule:\n\nkr = k\no\nr exp(γf / kBT)\n\n(2.83)\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nA Monte Carlo method is employed at each time step in the calculation to determine bond\nformation or breakage. In these studies, the nature of the leukocyte-endothelial interaction is\ncharacterized as firm adhesion, rolling adhesion, bimodal adhesion, or no adhesion, and mapped\nas a function of the two parameters of the Bell model in Fig. 3. The boundaries of the rolling\nadhesion regime are identified for a wall shear rate of 100 s-1 (dotted lines) or 30 and 400 s-1\n(solid lines). Most literature values for the Bell model parameters for a variety of selectin\nreceptors (known to be instrumental in leukocyte rolling) correspond to the rolling adhesion\nregime for typical shear rate of 100 s-1. An interesting, but counterintuitive result from this study\nwas the observation that, as the bond stiffness was increased from the value used in most\ncalculations (100 dyne cm-1), adhesiveness decreased, which the authors attribute to reduced\ndeflection for a given level of force, leading subsequently to more rapid dissociation.\n\nFig. 3.1.18. The state diagram for a leukocyte interacting with an endothelial surface for shear\nrates ranging from 30 to 400 s-1. For low dissociation rates, the leukocyte remains adherent to\nthe surface (lower left). As either (γ) or ( k\no\nr ) [see Eqn. (2.83) for definitions] is increased, the\ncell first adheres firmly, then rolls along the wall, then completely detaches (upper right). Rolling\nadhesion is defined as the regime where rolling occurs over some part of the shear rate range\nbetween 30 and 400 s-1. Firm adhesion indicates that cells remain attached even at the highest\nshear rate; no adhesion indicates that cells roll at a velocity > 50% of the velocity of a non-\nadherent sphere. In the bimodal regime cells are either adherent or non-adherent and do not\nexhibit rolling. Dotted curves correspond to these same boundaries for a shear rate of 100 s-1.\nReproduced from Chang et al (2000).\n\nCHAPTER 2.1: CELL MEMBRANE MECHANICS AND ADHESION\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n\nIn another recent study using high-resolution video-microscopy (Schmidtke and Diamond\n2000), it was demonstrated that a flowing neutrophil can attach to an adherent platelet via\nadhesion molecules located in the tips of the microvilli and form long tethers averaging nearly 10\nμm in length but ranging up to 40 μm at extensional rates of 6-40 μm s-1 for shear rates ranging\nfrom 100-250 s-1.

This fibrous matrix is instrumental to a\nwide variety of essential cell functions ranging from migration to adhesion to mitosis to\nmechanotransduction (the genetic response of a cell to mechanical stimuli). For some cells, their\nintrinsic elasticity determines their deformation in response to external forces. Cells such as\nthose circulating within or lining the walls of the vascular system are subjected to fluid dynamic\nforces and change shape as a direct consequence of those forces. In other cells, such as those\nsurrounded by a stiffer extracellular matrix, their shape is dictated by the deformation of the\nstructures in which they are embedded and the cell's own elastic characteristics play little role in\ndetermining the magnitude of those deformations. Even in these, however, externally-imposed\ndeformations produce intercellular forces that can influence cell secretions, gene expression and\nprotein synthesis.\nCell migration results from an interaction between the forces of adhesion to structures\nexternal to the cell (extracellular matrix in vivo or cell culture substrate for in vitro preparations),\nand the cell's own intrinsic stiffness in response to internally generated forces. As will be shown\nin Chapter 2.31, the speed of migration depends on a critical balance between cell stiffness and\nadhesion strength such that migration speed is reduced when the cell is either too rigid or too\ncompliant.\nMechanotransduction is the term used to describe gene expression in response to cellular\ndeformations or forces acting on the cell. This appears to be a property of nearly all eukaryotic\n\n1 Note that the references to other chapters pertain to a book currently in-progress, most of which is not yet available\nto students.\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\ncells and provides an important means by which the cells can respond to their environment. The\nresponse may be a protective one, leading for example to the formation of actin stress fibers\nwithin the cell or the production of new ECM materials to bolster stiffness of the surrounding\nnetwork, or it may be a natural step in the sequence of development, leading to cell\ndifferentiation. Whatever the result, it is clear that cells are exquisitely sensitive to physical\nstresses present in their environment, a topic discussed in detail in Chapter 2.3.\n\nWhile the importance of the cytoskeleton is well established, our understanding of the\nrelationship between the microstructural details and the macroscopic properties they produce is\nstill a matter of considerable debate and several fundamentally different models have been\nproposed. Part of the reason for this lack of consensus is that the cytoskeletal structure can\nappear quite distinct in different cell types. The stiffness exhibited by an erythrocyte, for\nexample, as it deforms to pass through a narrow capillary is entirely different from that of an\nendothelial cell lining the vessel. Different molecular constituents may be responsible for the\nobserved elasticity, and their structures differ markedly. Even in a single cell type, or a\nparticular cell, the structure is highly variable and can change markedly in response to\nenvironmental factors such as mechanical or electrical stimulation.\n\nThis chapter starts by presenting what is known about the cytoskeletal microstructure, its\nconfiguration and molecular constituents in Section 2.2.2. Next, the various methods that have\nbeen used either to describe the elasticity of the matrix or to explain its physical basis are\ndiscussed in Section 2.2.3. In Section 2.2.4, we describe some of the experimental methods and\nresults obtained that provide the basis for much of what we currently know about the\ncytoskeleton and its structural characteristics. Interpretation of the experimental results often\nrequires some analysis and the methods used for this purpose are derived. These start from the\nmost basic phenomenological models and proceed to the more recent microstructural\ndescriptions. This matrix is immersed in a liquid, the cytosol, that influences primarily the\ndynamic response of the cell which, depending on the length scale of the measurement, can\neither appear as water or as a highly viscous or viscoelastic fluid (Section 2.2.5). Many of these\nconcepts are subsequently applied in later chapters to understand the characteristics of particular\ncells types and to describe some of the differences that have been observed.\n\n2.2.2 Constituents of the cytoskeleton\n\nThe cytoskeleton is the network of biopolymers that permeate the cell and give rise to its\nstructural integrity. This network appears, on high magnification, to be comprised of several\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\ndistinct types of intertwined filaments with a variety of interconnections as can be seen in the\nmicrograph of Fig. 1. The network, as seen at this high magnification, is not unlike that of other\nfibrous materials when viewed at much lower magnification (Fig. 2) and, as one might expect,\nshares some of the same structural characteristics. As with these other common materials, the\napparent stiffness of the network depends fundamentally upon the elastic properties of the\nconstituent fibers. For this reason, it is appropriate to begin this chapter by examining the\nbiological composition and properties of the biopolymers that constitute the network. It is\nimportant to recognize, however, that unlike these other macroscale fibrous materials, the elastic\nproperties of the cytoskeleton are also critically dependent upon the effects of thermal\nfluctuations as will be discussed later.\n\nFig. 1. The cytoskeleton of a macrophage lamellipodium as seen by electron microscopy. The\nfibrous structure is mainly comprised of actin filaments.

Comparison with other fibrous materials (from Gibson & Ashby)\nendothelial\ncell\nfelt\npaper\ncotton\nspace shuttle tile\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nThe cytoskeletal matrix is primarily comprised of three constituents, actin microfilaments\n7 to 9 nm in diameter, microtubules (24 nm), and intermediate filaments (~10 nm) (Table 4).\nThese form a complex interconnected network that exists in a state of constant flux especially\nwhen the cell is dividing, migrating, or undergoing other dynamic processes. All are polymers\nbuilt from protein subunits, held together by noncovalent bonds. They also share the common\nfeature that they cross-link, often with the aid of other proteins, to form bundles and lattice\nnetworks. The secondary and tertiary structures formed by these polymers, as we will see, are\ncritical determinants of cytoskeletal elasticity.\nActin microfilaments\nActin filaments play an essential role in virtually all types of motility. Actin-myosin interactions\nare of obvious importance in muscle, but are also instrumental in the migration and movement of\nnon-muscle cells. Actin polymerization is thought to be one of the factors initiating cell\nmigration through the formation of filopodia or lamellapodia [Svitkina & Borisy, 1999]. The\nactin matrix, though common to nearly all eukaryotes, may be organized differently in different\ncells. The fluorescent micrograph of Fig. 3 shows the organization of the filamentous actin (F-\nactin) in a migrating fibroblast cell. Notice the intense staining at the leading edge, and the large\ncable-like structures (stress fibers) aligned primarily in the direction of movement and\nconnecting the rest of the cell to the protruding segment. Using a different preparation (freeze\ndeep-etch, Fig. 4) the lattice structure typical of that in the cortical or cytoskeletal regions of\nresting cells, can be seen to be highly interconnected and relatively isotropic.\n\nFig. 3. Fluorescent micrographs showing actin microfilaments (left), microtubules (center) and\nintermediate filaments (right) (reproduced from Ingber, 1998).\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nFig. 4. Quick-freeze deep-etch image of the cytoskeleton of an endothelial cell (courtesy of J.\nHartwick)\n\nActin is one of the most prevalent proteins found in the cell, ranging in concentration\nfrom 1 - 10% by weight of total cell protein in non-muscle cells, to 10-20% in muscle.\nMolecular actin is comprised of 375 residues (molecular weight 43 kDa), but is found in at least\nsix forms that differ from each other only slightly. Of these, four are found in muscle, the other\ntwo in non-muscle cells. Actin exists either in globular form (G-actin monomers) or filamentous\nform (F-actin polymer) with the balance between the two being a highly dynamic process that is\nfinely regulated by a variety of different factors. For example, the addition of certain ions (Mg2+,\nK+, Na+) has been found to induce reversible polymerization of actin monomers. Cytochalasins,\non the other hand, bind to the barbed ends of the actin filaments and prevent polymerization\nwhile phalloidin binds to the pointed ends and prevents dissociation into G-actin. F-actin\nassembly is regulated by capping proteins such as gelsolin that bind to barbed ends. Gelsolin\nalso severs filaments, a process that can be activated by Ca2+.\n\nF-actin is a long, flexible filament about 7 nm in diameter. Subunits (monomers) are\norganized into a double-stranded helix having structural and functional polarity (pointed or\nnegative, and barbed or positive ends) and a half-pitch of about 37 nm (Fig. 5). At the barbed\nend, an ATP binding cleft is exposed, allowing for binding of monomer and linear growth of the\nfilament. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a critical role in regulating actin dynamics and\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\ncontrolling the length of the actin filament. Within the cell, there exists a delicate balance\nbetween polymerization at the barbed ends and de-polymerization at the pointed ends.\n\nFig. 5 Schematic showing the arrangement of G-actin monomers to form F-actin.\n\nThe F-actin filaments can further organize into tertiary structures such as bundles or a\nlattice network with the aid of actin binding proteins (ABP). The bundles, also referred to as\nstress fibers, are closely packed parallel arrays of filaments, connected to each other by several\nmembers of the ABP family (Table 1). These can vary in size, but are typically about 0.1 micron\nin diameter. Networks consist of an interconnected matrix of F-actin filaments, the junctions of\nwhich are often seen to be nearly orthogonal. At least two distinct types of network are observed\n- cortical (membrane-associated and more planar in nature) and non-membrane-associated which\npossess a more isotropic three-dimensional structure.\nThe formation of both bundles and networks is facilitated by a variety of cross-linking\nproteins, some of which are listed in Table 1. One in particular, ABP-280 or filamin (a dimer\nconsisting of two 280 kDa subunits) forms a V-shaped polymer that connects two actin filaments\nnearly at right angles, forming a regular lattice in three dimensions. Others provide the\nconnection of F-actin to the cell membrane.\n\nThe elastic properties of actin have been measured in a variety of ways: by axial stretch\n(Higuchi et al., 1995), twisting (Tsuda et al., 1996, Yasuda et al., 1996), and bending. By all\nmethods, a single actin filament was found to exhibit a Young's modulus in the range of 1.3x109\nN/m2 to 2.5x109 N/m2. This value compares favorably with those measured for silk and collagen\n(Gittes et al., 1993), and are also roughly consistent with predictions based on van der Waals\nbonding between surfaces (Howard, 2001).\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nProtein\nFunction\nMW (kDa)\nLocation\nthymosin\nprofilin\ncofilin/ADF\ngelsolin\nArp2/3\nfimbrin\nα-actinin\nfilamin\n(ABP-280)\nspectrin\nERM (ezrin,\nradixin, moesin)\nfamily proteins\nmonomer binding\nmonomer binding,\nregulates barbed end\nmonomer binding,\nregulates barbed\nend, filament\nsevering\nfilament severing\nand capping protein\nfilament capping,\nnucleation\nfilament cross-\nlinking\nfilament cross-\nlinking\nfilament\nconnections at right\nangles\nlinks to membranes\nfilament cross-\nlinking\n15-19\n44/50\n100(x 2)\n246 + 280\n\ncytoskeleton\ncytoskeleton\ncytoskeleton\ncytoskeleton\ncytoskeleton\nmicrovilli, adhesion\nplaques\nfilopodia, lamellipodia,\nstress fibers\nfilopodia, stress fibers\nerythrocytes\ncytoskeleton\nTable 1. Some examples of actin binding proteins.\n\nActin stress fibers tend to form when the cell requires additional strength, such as in\nendothelial cells, in response to an elevated shear stress, or in migrating fibroblasts. These fibers\noften concentrate around and attach to focal adhesion sites, discussed elsewhere in the context of\ncell adhesion.\nF-actin is also prominent in microvilli, the finger-like protrusions of the plasma\nmembrane often found in cells involved in adsorption. These microvilli which increase the\nsurface area of a cell can dramatically augment the rate of exchange between the cell and its\nenvironment. Both F-actin and G-actin are present at high concentration in filopodia (spike-like\nprotrusions) and lamellipodia (broad, sheet-like extensions). In microvilli, actin may be present\nmainly to lend structural integrity, while in filopodia and lamellipodia, its role is thought to be\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nmore dynamic and is critical to the process of initiating and extending these processes. Whereas\nthis chapter focuses on the structural characteristics of the cytoskeleton, actin is also critical in\nmany dynamic processes such as cell migration or muscle contraction, which are discussed later,\nin Chapter 2.3.\nIntermediate filaments\nThe intermediate filaments (IF) of approximately 10 nm diameter appear to play primarily a\nstructural role as they have not been identified to be involved in cell movement. Even their\nstructural role, however, is not well delineated. The intermediate filaments are much less studied\nthan actin and not as well characterized. Perhaps this is due to the fact that there is no single\nmolecular constituent that comprises the intermediate filaments, instead, there are more than 50\ndifferent IF genes that have been identified. These can be classified into six groups based on\nsimilarities in their amino acid sequence.\n\nIntermediate filaments constitute roughly 1% of total protein in most cells, but\ncan account for up to 85% in cells such as epidermal keratinocytes and neurons (Fuchs and\nCleveland, 1998). While they come in many varieties, they share a common structural\norganization. All have a central α-helical domain of over 300 amino acids with amino- and\ncarboxy-terminal domains at the ends. As illustrated in Fig. 6, assembly occurs by the formation\nof dimers into a coiled coil structure. Then the dimers assemble in a staggered anti-parallel array\nto form tetramers that connect end-to-end to form apolar protofilaments. These protofilaments\nassemble into a rope-like structure containing approximately 8 each. (see also Fuchs and\nCleveland for an alternative view). Although intermediate filaments are more stable than the\nmicrofilaments, they can be modified by phosphorylation. This occurs on a time scale typically\nlonger than that for changes in the F-actin structures, however.\nIntermediate filaments tend to be found near the nuclear envelope, extending outward,\nreaching to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3). As this arrangement suggests, intermediate filaments\nare thought to help anchor the nucleus in the cell. The structural role of intermediate filaments is\nreinforced by their presence, as keratin filaments, in epithelial cells, connecting to the plasma\nmembrane at desmosomes and hemidesmosomes and helping to withstand mechanical stress.\nHowever , they exhibit a lower bending stiffness than either microfilaments or microtubules, as\nevidenced by their persistence length of only 1-3 μm.\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nType\nProtein\nSize (kDa) Site of expression\nI\nacidic keratins\n40-60\nepithelial cells\nII\nneutral or basic keratins\n50-70\nepithelial cells\nIII\nvimentin\nfibroblasts, WBC\ndesmin\nmuscle cells\nglian fibrilary acidic protein\nglial cells\nperipherin\nperipheral neurons\nIV\nneurofilament proteins\n60-150\nneurons\nα-intermixin\nneurons\nV\nnuclear lamins\n60-75\nnuclear lamina\nVI\nnestin\nstem cells of CNS\n\nTable 2. Various types of intermediate filaments\n\nFig. 6. Intermediate filament assembly\n\nLinker proteins such as BPAG1 and plectin contain both actin and IF binding domains,\nproviding a means by which these networks can be linked. Evidence also exists for plectin\nbinding to microtubules.\nIt was mentioned earlier that the intermediate filaments are generally believed not to be\nimportant for cell growth or movement. This is based on experimental observations in which\nintermediate filament integrity has been disrupted with no observable effect on migratory or\nmitotic behavior.\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nMicrotubules\nMicrotubules take the form of hollow rods with approximately 25 nm outer diameter and 14 nm\ninner diameter. By comparison to either microfilaments or intermediate filaments, microtubules\nare rigid structures, but exist in a dynamic equilibrium much as do microfilaments. To a large\nextent the microtubules determine cell shape and are important in cell mirgration, and especially\nduring the process of mitosis (see Fig. 6-1). They also are central to the motion of cilia and\nflagella.\n\nFig. 6-1. A newt cell in the metaphase of mitosis. Left: Fluorescent image showing the\nmicrotubules, attached to the opposed spindle poles, in green and the chromosomes in blue.\nRight: Image of a similar cell obtained by high voltage electron microscopy. The microtubules\nprovide the network along which the chromosomes move toward the poles. [Reproduced from\nhttp://www.wadsworth.org/BMS/SCBlinks/WEB_MIT2/res_mit.htm, C. Rieder.]\n\nThe tubular structures are comprised of tubulin, a globular dimer consisting of two 55\nkDa polypeptides, α-tubulin and β-tubulin. The dimers polymerize to form microtubules that\nconsist of 13 linear protofilaments forming a hollow-cored cylinder (Fig. 7). The filaments are\npolar having a rapidly growing end and a slowly growing end.\nBoth α-tubulin and β-tubulin bind GTP that regulates polymerization. The GTP bound to\nβ-tubulin is hydrolized to GDP after polymerization. The GDP that remains bound to tubulin is\nless stable and can release from the ends of the microtubule. If the hydrolysis occurs too\nquickly, before new GTP-bound tubulin can bind to the end, the microtubule might disassemble.\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nThis can lead to what is termed \"dynamic instability\" in that, depending on the rate of hydrolysis\nand rate of GDP-bound tubulin addition to the end, the microtubule can either grow or shrink\n(Mitcheson, Kirschner, see also Ch. 3.4). In fact, free ends tend to alternate between periods of\nsteady growth and disassembly in a stochastic manner.\nMeasurements have indicated that because of this dynamic process, the half-life of a\nmicrotubule is typically only several minutes. This time can vary considerably, though, and is\nlikely much shorter during mitosis, during which the microtubules play a critical role and need to\nundergo even more rapid turnover. The importance of microtubule assembly during mitosis has\nbeen demonstrated by the effect that tubulin binding agents such as colchicine and colcemid have\non cell division. This prevents the addition of monomers to the microtubule and, as a\nconsequence, prevents mitosis entirely. Because of this capability, related drugs such as cristine\nand vinblastine are used as chemotherapy for cancer. Another cancer drug, taxol, stabilizes\nmicrotubules and thereby also blocks mitosis.\nDuring interphase, microtubules tend to be anchored (at their negative ends) to the\ncentrosome, located near the nucleus. From there they extend to all parts of the cell, suggesting a\nstrong role in maintaining the structural integrity of the cell. Microtubules also play a role in\nintracelllular transport of vesicles and organelles, beating of cilia and flagella when in\nconjunction with motor proteins such as the kinesins and dyneins (discussed in Chapter 2.3).\nIn many of these situations, the microtubule is thought to play a structural role that relies on it\nhaving a high bending stiffness. Measurements (Gittes et al., 1993) have, in fact, determined the\nbending stiffness (Kb = EfI) of isolated microtubules based on their thermal fluctuations and\nfound it to be on the order of 2.6x10-23 N.m2. This may not seem very large, but given its\ndiameter, and that the moment of inertia varies as the fourth power of radius, this is really quite\nan impressive value.\n\nFig. 7.

Note that\nthe Young's modulus, estimated using the diameter and bending stiffness values for actin\nfilaments and microtubules, is approximately the value that would be predicted on the basis of\nvan der Waals attraction between two surfaces (J. Howard, 2001). Recall that the persistence\nlength and bending stiffness are related through the expression lp = Kb / kBT , and that\nKb = EI = E π\n4 a4 for a rod of circular cross-section.\n2.2.3 Mechanical properties of the cytoskeletal network\n\nAs is evident from the discussion of the last section, the cytoskeleton consists of a complex\nbiopolymer network with varying degrees of interconnection, existing in a state of dynamic\nequilibrium. The dynamic state arises from the continual polymerization and depolymerization\nof the constituent filaments and the changing density of cross-links between filaments of the\nsame or different family. This picture is complicated further by the milieu of other intracellular\nconstituents that may or may not affect structural properties exhibited by the cell.\n\nTo make progress in understanding the mechanics of the cytoskeleton, we will focus on\nthose filamentous components discussed earlier, the F-actin, intermediate filaments, and\nmicrotubules. We will also simplify by making plausible conjectures about the geometry of the\nstructure and its state within the cell in the absence of external forces.\n\nOur objective in this section is to come to a better appreciation of how the elastic\nproperties and geometric arrangement of the constituent filaments give rise to the elastic\nproperties observed by the various experimental methods just described. These experiments\nhave shown that the elastic modulus of cells can vary considerably from one cell type to another.\nCells of the epidermis, for example, require greater structural integrity than the red blood cells\nsubjected to the relatively low shear stresses in the blood. Even within a given cell type, the\nelastic properties can change. Skeletal muscle, for example, changes its modulus by over an\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\norder of magnitude within a small fraction of a second. Other cells change too, but more often\nover a longer time period, in response, for example, to changes in their mechanical environment.\n\nTo help put these measurements of stiffness in context, consider the data presented in Fig\n8. According to the various measurements that have been made, cells seem to range in shear\nmodulus from about 10 to 104 Pa (see Table 4), and therefore exhibit a stiffness somewhat lower\nthan collagen gels at low concentration (or common gelatins) or relaxed skeletal muscle. (Allow\nyour leg to relax completely, then feel the stiffness of your calf to get a sense for an elasticity of\nabout 104 Pa.) This range probably says more about differences in the models used as a basis to\ninfer the shear modulus from the data than it does about real cell-to-cell variations. At best,\nthese numbers inferred from experiment should be viewed as measures of an \"effective\nstiffness\" and comparisons between different measurement methods and interpretation should be\nmade with caution. Nonetheless, since cells vary widely in their function, it would be surprising\nif their mechanical properties were not also variable. Other biological materials (e.g., bone,\nwood) exhibit a much higher modulus, but not because of their cellular content. Rather, their\nhigh stiffness is due to the calcification in bone and the collagen matrix found in wood and most\nplants. In tissues, too, the stiffness we measure is more often associated with the extracellular\nmatrix with its elastin and collagen, than the constituent cells.\nThe elastic moduli of the cytoskeletal filaments are also shown in the figure. Notice that\nthe filaments themselves (F-actin, intermediate filaments, and microtubules) all exhibit moduli\nmuch greater than the measured modulus of the cytoskeleton. These two must be\n\nFig. 8.

In Section 2.2.4 we explore\ndifferent approaches that have been developed to relate the properties of the individual fibers to\nthose of the assembled network. First, though, we discuss some of the methods that have been\nused to describe cell elasticity. Some of these methods are developed more fully in Chapter 1.2.\nHere we provide a brief review in the context of problems in cytoskeletal mechanics.\n2.2.4 Experimental measurements of cell elasticity\n\nEssentially any intervention that produces deformation of the cell can, and often has, been used\nto infer its mechanical properties. Many of these methods derive from common engineering\nusage while others have been developed specifically for the purpose of examining the\nmechanical properties of a cell. Taken as a group, these methods form the basis for all current\nknowledge of cell mechanical properties and it is therefore appropriate that we focus our\nattention on the methods that have been used and continue to be developed. In interpreting these\ndata, however, note that whenever the cell is deformed, its response reflects not only the\nelasticity of the cytoskeleton, but also of the lipid bilayer, and depending on the rate of\ndeformation, perhaps the viscosity of cell constituents as well. Its deformation will depend on\nthe cell dimensions and its external tethering. Furthermore, the cell is neither homogeneous,\nconsisting of organelles, ribosomes, and numerous other structures, making it difficult to\ninterrogate one isolated constituent, nor isotropic. In much of what follows, we treat the\nmembrane and cytoskeleton as ideal, isotropic, homogeneous materials, either purely elastic or\nviscoelastic, while recognizing the simplifications this implies. Later in this chapter, we take a\ncloser look at the microstructure of the material to see how these measured properties relate to\nthe characteristics and deformations of the fibrous constituents of the matrix. Finally, it is\nimportant to recognize that these experimental results, while useful in their original, unprocessed\nform, normally are interpreted in the context of a particular model. In many of the models, for\nexample, the effect of the cell membrane is completely neglected, and the cell is treated as an\nelastic or viscoelastic continuum. Consequently, reported values for such properties as the\nYoung's modulus or shear modulus depend not solely on the measurement, but also on the\nparticular model used in the process of data analysis.\n\nCell poking and squashing (indentation analysis)\nThis test is one of the simplest methods to probe for cell stiffness, but as with all methods, the\nresults obtained need to be carefully interpreted. In principle, one need only push against the cell\nwith a known force and measure the displacement of the probe; for a given force, a stiffer cell\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nwill allow a smaller deflection than a compliant one. To interpret this measurement, the cell is\ntaken to be large compared to the size of the indenter (of radius a), as well as compared to the\ndeflection of the probe into the cell (δ), in order that the cell can be viewed as an elastic half-\nspace (Fig. 16). It will also be useful to assume that the cell can be treated as an elastic\ncontinuum in that the microstructure has a characteristic length scale small compared with either\na or δ (Fig. 16b). If so, we can treat the cell as having a homogenous composition, neglecting\nthe fine-scale structure of the constituent filaments. It is further assumed that the cell membrane\ncontributes little to the stiffness of the cell, and that the cell behaves as a linearly elastic material\nwith Young's modulus E and shear modulus G. While neglect of the cell membrane clearly\ncontradicts some of the findings just discussed in Chapter 2.2, it appears to be a reasonable\napproximation for some cell types and, in any event, provides the opportunity to focus attention\non the cytoskeleton. We will also consider the cytoskeleton to be incompressible for now.\nUnder these assumptions, a simple scaling analysis provides some instructive guidance.\n\nFor the situation shown in the figure, in which a cell is indented by a probe with a blunt\nsurface, the volume of the region within which the cell matrix is significantly deformed scales as\na3. Within this region, the deformations are of order δ, so that the localized strains (ε) are of\norder δ/a. The strain energy density scales as .τε ~ Eε\n2, so the total strain energy ~Eε\n2a3. The\nwork done by the indenter in producing this deformation is Fδ. Equating these, we obtain:\n\nFδ ~ E (δ/a)\n2 a3\n\n(56)\n\nor\n\nE ~ G ~ F/(δa)\n\n(57)\n\nThis suggests a linear relationship between the applied force and the displacement of the probe,\nconsistent with measurements made in lymphocytes (Fig. 17).\n\nThe scaling analysis that led to eqn. (57) is not capable of providing the dimensionless\ncoefficient necessary to produce an equality. That is, it fails to determine the constant c in the\nexpression:\n\nF = cGδa\n\n(58)\nor\n\nG = F/(cδa)\n\n(59)\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nTo determine the numerical value of c in Eqn. (59) requires either an experiment with a\nmaterial of known shear modulus or a more rigorous analysis. The analysis, performed based on\nthe assumptions stated previously, is a solution of the governing equations (7)-(9), representing\nan internal force balance and the constitutive relation that describes the nature of the material for\nan isotropic, Hookean elastic solid. Solution of these equations (see e.g., Johnson, 1985), with\nboundary conditions describing a uniform displacement over the region of contact between the\n(blunt) indenter and the cell surface gives rise to a solution of the same form of equation (59),\nbut with the constant c given as 8.\n\nUsing this method in\nconjunction with the experimental\ndata of Fig. 17 for example gives an\nestimate for the shear modulus of the\nlymphocyte of about 300 Pa and for\na neutrophil about 100 Pa. Both of\nthese increase when the cell is\nactivated (Zahalak et al., 1990).\nOnce we have the value of the shear\nor Young's modulus, along with an\nestimate for the Poisson ratio, we\ncan predict the response of the cell to\nother types of loading, using the\nmethods described in Ch.1.2 for\nan elastic continuum.\nFig. 17. Experimental measurements made by cell\nFig. 16. Cell poking experiment.\nSubstrate\nApplied force\nIndenter\nprobe\nCell\nδ\n2a\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nInterpretation of the experimental results is, however, not quite as straightforward as this\nanalysis might suggest. One complication that can immediately be seen is that the cell response\nis not purely elastic; if it were, the two curves in Fig. 9 corresponding to the forward and reverse\nmovement of the probe would be superimposable and not exhibit the hysteresis seen in the\nfigure. The fact that they are not indicates that the cell is not purely elastic, but rather, that it\nbehaves in a viscoelastic manner. It can therefore be analyzed using the approach presented\nbelow for a viscoelastic continuum. In this instance, it is convenient to begin with the integral\nformulation, eqns. (5) - (6). The expression relating force to deformation for an elastic solid\n(eqn. (58)) can be seen to be similar in form to eqn. (6) where k(t) takes the role of 8Ga with G\nbeing the shear modulus, and the integral expression (eqn. (6)) can be re-written in the following\nform using the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle (Christensen, 1971)\n\n∫\nt\n⎛d\nF(t) = 8a\nG(t -t)\nδ(t -t)⎞\n⎜\nd\n⎝\ndt\n⎟t\n\n(60)\n\n⎠\n\nwhere the integration begins at time t=0 when the probe begins its descent. If the cell were\ncomprised of a viscous liquid, G(t) = μδk(t), where μ is the Newtonian viscosity of the liquid\nand δk(t) is the Kronecker delta. Noting that in the present experiment, dδ / dt = v = const , the\nviscous contribution to the force can be written:\n\nt\ndδ (t)\nFv = 8a∫μδk (t -t\n)\ndt= 8avμ\n\n(62)\ndt\n\nThus, to a reasonable approximation, the viscoelastic cell can be thought of resisting the motion\nof the probe through a combination of the elastic and viscous contributions to force, or:\n\nF(t) = 8a[Gδ + μv]\n\n(63)\n\nComparing this to eqn. (58) and noting that δ = vt in this experiment, we see the strong similarity\nbetween the two expressions, and the significance of the effective viscosity term which decreases\nin importance as the rate of deformation is slowed. At rates rapid enough for viscoelastic effects\nto be seen, the presence of viscoelasticity exhibits itself by an upward movement of the force-\ndisplacement curve while the probe is moving into the cell, as can be seen in some of the\nZahalak [4] experiments. When the probe is reversed, the effects of viscosity are clearly evident\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nas indicated by the hysteresis of the curves and, though not considered here, can be analyzed by\nthe same procedures.\n\nMicropipette aspiration\nMicropipette aspiration is an alternative to the indentation test in which the cell is drawn into a\nsmall-bore pipette (Fig. 18). In this case, the result is an experimental relationship between the\naspiration pressure Δp (below the reference pressure around the cell) and the distance δ into the\npipette that the cell is drawn. The pipettes that are used are typically on the scale of a few\nmicrons in diameter, similar to the imposed deflections. These dimensions roughly satisfy the\nconstraints mentioned in the context of indetation studies, that l << a ~ δ << L where l is the\ncharacteristic length of the microstructure and L is the cell dimension, suggesting that a\ncontinuum analysis would be a reasonable approach.\n\nThe scaling analysis proceeds in a manner similar to that used for the indenter and the\ncell is assumed to be composed of a Hookean elastic solid that can be treated as a continuum. In\nthis case, however, two lengths characterize the pipette: the inner and outer radii, a and b,\nrespectively. The result obtained is analogous to the one given above for the indenter, except\nthat the applied force F in the previous case is now replaced by the force\n\nFig. 18. Schematic of a micropipette\naspiration experiment.\n\ndue to pressure, Δp.a2. The result is the scaling prediction\n\nE ~ Δp (a/δ)\n\n(64)\n\nwhere we have assumed that the important length scale for the deformations inside the cell is a\nrather than b. Alternatively, we can consider the limit as b approaches a, in which case the two\ncharacteristic lengths collapse into one.\nδ\nMicropipet\n2b\n2a\n-Δp\np=0\ncell\nL\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nAlso similar to the indenter, a more rigorous analysis can be performed to obtain the\nconstant of proportionality in the above relation, which in this case gives\n\n3 a\nb\nE =\nΔp\n⎛\n⎞\n⋅Φ\n⎜\nπ δ\n⎝a⎟\n\n⎠\n\n(65)\n\nwhere for b/a in the range of 1.1 to 2.0, Φ(b/a) lies between 2.2 and 1.4.\n\nExperimental results are typically plotted in terms of the distance of deformation into the\npipette as a function of the pressure reduction in the micropipette. The result is seen to be quite\nlinear for an endothelial cell (Fig. 19) consistent with the form of eqn. (9), which, by comparison\nto analytic predictions (see Theret [10]), gives values for the Young's modulus in the range of\n200 to 800 Pa. Interestingly, exposure of these cells to shear stress of 3 Pa increases E consistent\nwith the observation of new stress fibers organizing in the cytoskeleton\n\nFig.19. Experimental result obtained on a from an endothelial cell micropipette experiment\n(reproduced from Theret et al., 1988).\n\nIt is important to reiterate that in both of these cases, indentation and micropipette\naspiration, we have neglected the stiffness of the membrane. Incorporating its effect would tend\nto reduce these estimates of cytoskeletal elastic modulus. In the case of the lymphocyte,\nmicropipette experiments (Evans & Yeung, 1989) have suggested that the membrane behaves as\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nthough it were under a constant surface tension, independent of the amount of surface strain, of\n3.3x10-5 N/m.\n\nMagnetic twisting cytometry\nThe indentation and micropipette aspiration methods provide a measure of the elasticity of a\nsingle cell. By contrast, magnetic twisting cytometry (MCT) interrogates many cells\nsimultaneously, giving a single output representing an average over many cells. This has some\nadvantages in that it eliminates the need to do many individual measurements of obtain a result\ncharacteristic of a cell population, but also has some drawbacks in terms of being less amenable\nto direct interpretation.\n\nIn this technique, ferromagnetic microspheres are coated with a ligand (e.g., a synthetic\npeptide containing the RGD sequence) having an affinity for a particular cell receptor (e.g., the\nintegrin receptors). Binding to integrins assures strong linkage with the cytoskeleton, although\nother, non-cytoskeletal receptors can also be used to probe the differences in stiffness as a\nfunction of cytoskeletal tethering. These ligand-coated beads are then added to a population of\ncultured cells and allowed to bind. Once binding has occurred, the beads are magnetized by\napplication of strong magnetic field with a specific orientation. Then, a second magnetic field is\nimposed, perpendicular to the first, applying a twisting torque to the beads and causing them to\nrotate. This rotation is monitored by a magnetometer that measures the strength of the remnant\nfield in the direction of the original magnetization. Individual bead displacement can also been\nobserved to avoid artifacts associated with averaging over large numbers of beads with varying\ndegrees of attachment. After some degree of rotation has occurred, the twisting field is turned\noff and the cells are allowed to relax. This sequence is illustrated in Figs. 20 and 21 with the\ncorresponding mean rotations. The magnetic field can also be subjected to harmonic variations\nin torque over a range of frequencies to measure the storage and loss moduli of the cell.\n\nWith the MTC method, the beads are subjected to a torque so the resulting deformation of\nthe cell is quite complex compared to that for either of the two cases considered thus far. As the\nbead rotates (Fig. 20) the membrane and cytoskeleton are both deformed. Perhaps more\nimportantly, for a bead twisted in the clockwise direction, the right hand surface of bead might\ncome in direct or near contact with the cell and the possibility exists that the number of binding\nsites will increase during the period of twist. Similarly, stress on the binding sites on the left-\nhand surface of the bead will be high, possibly high enough to cause some of these bonds to be\ndisrupted. Either or these effects would both tend to prevent the bead from returning to its initial\norientation and may explain some of the non-reversible rotation seen in the experimental data\n(Fig. 21).\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nFig. 20. A schematic showing the forces and deformations produced by magnetic twisting\ncytometry.\n\nFig. 21. Typical experimental results obtained by magnetic twisting cytometry. The twisting\nangle θ can be viewed either as the rotation of a single bead, or the average rotation of a large\npopulation of beads, depending on the experiment.\n\nThe interaction forces between the bead and the cell membrane are sketched in\nqualitative terms in Fig. 20, and consist of both shear and normal stresses, tensile and\ncompressive. If the region of contact between the bead and cell membrane is characterized by\nthe contact radius a, and the rotation of the bead is small, then a balance of moments leads to the\nfollowing scaling relation:\n\nΘ~ a3τ\n\n(66)\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nwhere Θ is the torque applied to the bead by the magnetic field, since the force of interaction\nscales with the product of the peak stress and the area of contact, and the moment arm scales\nwith a. The work done by the rotation is\n.\nΘα where α is the (small) angle of rotation. Stresses\n(primarily shear) induced in the cell lead to strain energies that scale as τεa3 where ε ~ a.α/a ~ α\nand τ ~ εG. Equating these, one obtains\n\nG ~ Θ/(αa3)\n\n(67)\n\nOne of the advantages of this method is that by careful selection of the ligand used to\ncoat the bead, it is possible to selectively bind to specific families of cell surface receptors that\ndiffer in terms of the nature of their attachment to the cytoskeleton. This therefore allows the\npossibility to probe more selectively than in the indenter or micropipet methods.\n\nWhen oscillatory torques are applied and bead displacement rather than rotation is\nmeasured, the data are analyzed differently. A ratio is formed between the complex torque T*\nand the resulting complex displacement *\nδ , defining a new measure of elastic stiffness g* with\nunits of Pa/nm. A relationship between g* and G* is obtained by finite element analysis of a bead\nbeing rotated on a homogeneous, elastic material of given dimensions approximating those of a\ncell. Taking a representative value for this parameter, and assuming it to be independent of\nfrequency, the results of Fig. 22 are obtained for the storage and loss moduli. Notably, the data\nobtained in this manner for different cells and with a variety of biological manipulations all\nconformed to the following empirical expression (solid lines in Fig. 22):\n\nx 1\nG*\n⎛ω ⎞\n-\nπ\n= G\n⎡\n⎤\n+ η Γ\n-\n-\n+ ωμ\n\n(68)\n⎜\n⎟\n(1\ni ) (2\nx)cos⎢\n(x\n1)\ni\n⎝ω0 ⎠\n⎣2\n⎥⎦\n\nwhere G0 and ω0 are scale factors, η = tan(x -1)π / 2 , Γ denotes the gamma function, μ is a\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nNewtonian viscosity, and x is a parameter that characterizes the transition between solid-like\n(x=1) and fluid-like (x=2) behavior. The data fits seen in the figure were obtained using a single\nvalue each for G0 and ω0, leaving only x and , to a lesser extent, μ, to vary for different sets of\ndata. Similarity of these results with predictions for a soft glassy material suggest the possibility\nof a common physical basis that is still being explored.\n\nLaser and magnetic tweezers\nBeads that are either attached to the cell surface via receptor ligand bonds, or internalized by the\ncell through phagocytosis, can be forced either by the use of a magnetic or optical trap or\ntweezers. A magnetic trap acts in much the same manner as the MTC just described, on either\nparamagnetic or ferromagnetic beads, the difference being that a force, rather than a torque, acts\non each particle. The force can be either constant, or oscillatory with the latter being useful for\nthe purpose of obtaining estimates for the frequency dependence of the elastic moduli. In the\ncase of an optical trap, the particle merely has to have a different index of refraction than the\nFig. 22.

(Reproduced\nfrom Fabry, et al., 2001)\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nsurrounding medium, and the force, provided by a focused laser beam, relies on the deflection of\nthe beam and the corresponding change in photon momentum (see Chap. xx for a complete\ndescription).\n\nEach method has certain advantages and disadvantages. With a magnetic trap, force is\ncontrolled by the strength of the applied magnetic field and varies as the square of the field\nstrength as seen from the following expression for paramagnetic beads:\n\nF(t) = μ0χV∇(\n\nH ⋅H)\n\n(69)\n\nwhere χ is the volume susceptibility, μ0 is the permeability constant, V is the bead volume and\n\nH is the local, time-varying field strength. Thus, if the local field strength is known as well as\nthe magnetic characteristics of the particle, the force can be accurately controlled. Forces on the\norder of 10 nN have been produced using single-pole magnets brought to within 10-100 μm of\nthe bead. While single pole traps offer the potential for greater forces, they have the\ndisadvantage, however, that the field strength is spatially non-uniform. In order to produce more\nuniform fields, multiple-pole traps have been designed, but these are typically only capable of\ngenerating forces on the order of 100 pN. Displacement, in this case, depends on the applied\nforce and the elastic or viscoelastic properties of the cell, and is determined by direct observation\nof the bead motion.\n\nIn the case of the optical trap, moving the focal point of the laser controls the position of\nthe bead. Force measurement, however, is more difficult since it relies on a precise calibration\nof the force well in the vicinity of the laser focal point and the ability to measure small\ndisplacements of the bead from the point of equilibrium. A further disadvantage is that forces\nonly up to about 10 pN can be generated on a micron size particle by an optical trap with ~1 W\nof laser power, below the damage threshold for living cells.\n\nData analysis depends on whether the bead is attached to membrane receptors or\ninternalized by the cell. For beads inside the cell, and assuming the cell can be treated as a\nhomogeneous, incompressible viscoelastic continuum extending to infinity, acted on by a time\nvarying force F(t), the equation of motion is given by\n\ndx\nF(t) = 6 a⎛\nπ ⎜G′x\n⎞\n+ μ\n⎟\n\n(70)\n⎝\ndt ⎠\n\n(for the elastic solution, see Lin et al., Summer Bioengineering Conferrence, 2003) where x is the\nbead displacement in the direction of forcing, G′ is the storage modulus and μ the viscosity of\nthe medium. The second term can be seen to be the expression for Stokes drag on a sphere\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nwhereas the first is the elastic contribution, representing the force required to move a sphere a\ndistance x in an infinite elastic medium with shear modulus G'. In the case of oscillatory\nforcing, Eqn. (70) can be written using complex notation, substituting F(t) = F0 exp(iωt) and\nx(t) = x0 exp[i(ωt +φ)], leading to the following expressions for the storage and loss moduli\n(Zeimann, Radler and Sackmann, 1994):\n\nF cosφ\nG′ =\n\n(71)\n6πax0\n\nand\n\nF\nG′′ =\n0 sinφ\n\n(72)\n6πax0\n\nnoting that the quantity μω is equivalent to the loss modulus, G\".\n\nIf the bead is tethered to the membrane, then the analysis and forcing is tangent to the\nplane of the membrane, then the situation is somewhat more complicated. The simplest\napproach would be to say that the membrane can still be neglected, and to a first approximation,\nthat the cell surface remains planar under forcing, leading to the estimate that the displacements\nfor a given force are twice what they would be for the bead totally immersed in a viscoelastic\nmedium. In that case the above analysis could still apply, except that the numerical factors in\neqns. (71) & (72) would change from 6 to 3. Alternatively, the membrane can be taken into\naccount explicitly which naturally leads to a considerably more complicated result (see e.g.,\nBoulbitch, 1999).\n\nAFM methods\nA variation on the cell indentation technique involves the use of an AFM probe to apply the\ntime-varying force. The advantages of this approach are that the force can be oscillated over a\nrange of frequencies facilitating the calculation of the complex shear modulus G*, and that the\nprobe can be scanned over the cell while oscillating, thereby producing an elasticity map of the\ncell surface.\n\nIn one application of AFM to obtain G*(ω) at a fixed point in the cell, a small spherical\nbead was attached to the AFM tip so that the Hertz contact model could be used for data\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\ninterpretation.

Considering only the oscillatory\ncomponent of this force Fosc, the following expression for the complex shear modulus can be\nobtained:\n\nG*\n1 ⎛1-ν 2 ⎞\nF\n= G′ + iG′′ =\nosc\n⎜\n⎟\n\n(75)\n4 ⎝1+ν ⎠δ δ0a\n\nfor situations in which δ/δ <<1 where F and δ\nosc\nare both complex quantities.\n\nIn experiments conducted on NIH3T3 fibroblasts, static values for E/(1- 2\nν ) ranged\nbetween 1-2 kPa. When the bead was oscillated at frequencies between 50 and 300 Hz with\noscillation amplitudes of 5-20 nm, values for the real and imaginary parts of E* both fell in the\nrange of 1-10 kPa with the loss modulus contribution increasing significantly over this frequency\nrange.\n\nAFM can also be used in a different way that makes effective use of its ability to probe\nlarger surfaces. As the probe traverses a specimen such as a cell, it can be sequentially used to\nindent the cell at each location, simultaneously measuring the applied force and the\ndisplacement. In this sense, it acts in the same manner as cell indentation described above,\nexcept that it can repeat this procedure many times on a single cell, using a probe with tip\ndimensions on the scale of several nanometers, producing a stiffness map of the cell (Fig. 23(A)).\nData are analyzed using a form of the Hertz contact model, modified for a pointed, conical tip,\nand corrected for the force required to deflect the AFM cantilever arm. If it is further assumed\n\n2 Note that this expression differs from the scaling suggested by eqn. (56). This is due to the assumption, in this\ninstance, of a spherical tip in which case the area of contact between the probe and the cell membrane increases as\nthe applied force is increased.)\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nthat the material deformations are quasi-steady so that viscous contributions can be neglected,\nthe shear modulus can be calculated from (Haga, et al., 2000):\n\nπ\nF(1-ν)\nG =\n\n(76)\n4δ\ntanα\n\nwhere α is the half-angle of the conical tip. When interpreted in this manner, the assumption\nbeing made, as mentioned before, is that the material is a homogeneous elastic continuum, thus\nneglecting the effect of the membrane and the discrete filament structure of the cytoskeleton.\nInterestingly, the stiffness map in Fig. 23 clearly delineate the actin\n\nFig. 23.

Nonetheless, this method provides the only means currently\navailable to obtain such detailed information on the relative stiffness of different cell\ncomponents, in this case showing that the nucleus is more compliant than the rest of the cell,\nwith values for the Young's modulus (assuming ν=0.5) ranging from ~4 to 100 kPa.\n\nLaser tracking microrheology (Yamada, Wirtz and Kuo, 2000)\nOne of the inherent drawbacks of all the methods described so far, is that they each involve the\nexternal application of force to a cell via a foreign body. This inevitably elicits a biological\nresponse from the cell, either through receptor bonding or by the application of force, that could\nalter the structural characteristics being measured. Indeed, micrographs of the cytoskeleton in\nthe vicinity of adherent beads showed marked changes just minutes after bead attachment\n(Maksym et al., 2000). Any method, therefore, that minimizes such disruptions to the cell,\nleaving it in its normal, quiescent state, would have significant advantage.\n\nLaser tracking microrheology (LTM) measures the viscoelastic properties of the cell by\nmonitoring the Brownian motion of spherical particles embedded in the cell. While the particles\nmight be small microspheres that are introduced by phaogocytosis, alternatively, the method can\nalso be applied to spherical granulocytes that are naturally found in many cell types. In the latter\ncase, disruption to the cell is kept to a minimum giving this method clear advantages over others.\n\nParticle motion in LTM is detected by deflections in the forward scattered light from a\nsingle particle located at the focal point of a low-power laser. Following calibration, this allows\nthe measurement of the mean squared displacement (MSD) of a particle's path relative a fixed\nreference point, computed as\n\nMSD = ΔR2(τ ) = (1/ n)\nr(t +τ\n(\n)-r(t))2\n⎡⎣\n⎤⎦\nn∑\n,\n\nwhere τ is the elapsed time between the two measurements (obtained from a two-dimensional\nimage). The MSD is measured over a large range of time scales to distinguish between viscous\nmaterials for which MSD ∝t and elastic ones for which MSD ~ constant. In the more general\ncase of a viscoelastic material, the complex shear modulus can be obtained from the following\napproximation for the unilateral Laplace transform of the shear modulus (Mason & Weitz, 1995):\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nG\n2k\n(s) =\nBT\n\n(77)\n3πas ΔR2(s)\n\nwhere s is the complex Laplace frequency, appropriate for the two-dimensional MSD. Implicit in\nthis expression are the assumptions that Stokes law for the force on a sphere traveling at speed V\n(F=6πaμδ) can be generalized to a viscoelastic material, that the material can be treated as a\nhomogeneous continuum, and that the particle is a rigid sphere.\nIt is useful to examine this expression in the two limits of a viscous liquid and an elastic\nsolid. In the case of a viscous liquid, the MSD in two-dimensions would vary as 4D0t, where D0\nis the diffusion coefficient of the particle, given by the Stokes-Einstein relation to be kBT/6πμa.\nTaking the Laplace transform of the MSD and substituting this result into (77) yields G(s) = μs\ngiving a complex modulus, G(ω) = iμω . Consequently, G'(ω) = 0 and G\"(ω) = μω, the real\nand imaginary parts of G, respectively. For a linear elastic (Hookean) solid, MSD = kBT /πG0a\nwhere G0 is the constant shear modulus of the material, so that G'(ω) = G0 and G\"(ω) = 0.\nIn the more general case, but still in keeping with the assumptions given above, the\ncomplex shear modulus can be written in the form:\n\nG(iω) = G*(ω) = G′ + iG′′ = G*(ω) exp(iδ(ω))\n\n(78)\n\nwhere δ = arctan[G′′(ω) /G′(ω)], G*(ω) is computed from the MSD using the approximation\n(Tschoegl, 1989, Mason et al., 1997):\n\nG*\n2k\n(ω) ≈\nBT\n\n(79)\n⎛\nd ln ΔR (τ ) ⎞\n3πa ΔR (τ ) Γ⎜1+\n⎟\n⎝\nd lnτ\n⎠\n\nwhere Γ is the gamma function.

The shear modulus, for example, varies over quite a wide range (four orders of\nmagnitude!) as shown in Table 4. While some of this variability no doubt reflects actual\ndifferences due to cell type, much is likely also due to inconsistencies either in the assumptions\nused to interpret the experimental data or the extent to which the biological state of the cells was\ninfluenced by the testing procedure. With respect to modeling assumptions, there is currently\nlittle agreement concerning the most valid approach. Factors that need to be considered include\nthe following:\n\n- the relative importance of the lipid bilayer, the cortex, the nucleus and the cytoskeleton,\n- the size of the probe used to make measurements,\n- the extent to which the cytoplasm can be treated as homogeneous,\n- the role of adhesion or other biological responses in the vicinity of the probe.\n\nCell type\nMeasurement\nmethod\nShear modulus (Pa)\nReference\nlymphocyte\nlymphocyte (activated)\nneutrophil (activated)\nneutrophil\nNIH 3T3 fibrobalst\nNIH 3T3 fibroblast\nJ774 mouse macrophage\n3T3 and NRK fibroblast\nmouse fibroblast\nendothelial cell\nbovine endothelial cell\nporcine endothelial cell\nendothelial cell\npoking\npoking\npoking\npoking\nmagnetic tweezers\nAFM\nmagnetic tweezers\nAFM\npoking\naspiration\nindentation\naspiration\nmagnetic twisting\ncytometry (MTC)\n700 - 1100\n\n20,000-40,000\n4,000-100,000\n1,000-10,000\n1600 (E)\n40-50\n400-600\n75 (E)\n2.2 (round) (E)\n4.5 (spread) (E)\nZahalak et al.\nZahalak et al.\nZahalak et al.\nZahalak et al.\nBausch et al.\nHaga et al.\nBausch et al.\nRotsch &\nRademacher\nPeterson et\nal.\nTheret et al.\nSato et al.\nSato et al.\nWang et al.\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nbovine endothelial cell\nMTC\n3-7.5\nWang &\nStamenovic\nhuman chondrocytes\naspiration\nTrickey et al.\nsmooth muscle cell\nMTC\n11.5 (E)\nStamenovic\n& Coughlin\nCOS7 (kidney epithelial)\nlaser tracking\n33-82 ( G* )\nYamada, et\nmicrorheology\nal.\n\nTable 4. Some representative values for the shear modulus of different cell types. In most cases,\nthese represent the modulus exhibited at long times.\n\nThese factors, and many others, will need to be better understood before reliable and consistent\nmeasurements can be made.\nMicro-structural models\nUp to this point, our discussions have been based on the assumption that whatever the structure\nof the cytoskeleton at the microscale, its mechanical properties as measured or as observed at the\nscale of a cell can be described in terms of a continuum. This is an expeditious approach, and\nthe one used in most of the studies of cytoskeletal properties. But this approach, that essentially\nignores the existence of a fine-scale microstructure can, at best, be only a means of describing\nthe behavior of the actual filamentous network that comprises the cytoskeleton and provides little\nby way of fundamental understanding the origin of these properties. To gain a full appreciation\nof how the various constituents of the network - actin filaments, intermediate filaments and\nmicrotubules - contribute to the observed properties, one must look, and think, on a much finer\nscale and consider how the individual filaments contribute to the overall elastic characteristics of\nthe material. It should be obvious that the following microstructural models are just that -\nmodels built upon certain assumptions about the mechanical behavior of the cytoskeleton. The\nfact that several exist, giving quantitatively and even qualitatively different predictions, should\nsuffice to convince the reader that there is no broad consensus as to the validity of any one\nmodel, and that they cannot all be valid. Only by the application of experimental methods that\nprobe at the microscale (e.g., laser trap and AFM) will we establish which is appropriate for a\ngiven cell type. Several models are presented here mainly because they help to illuminate\ndiverse ways of organizing our thoughts and obtaining testable predictions that will ultimately\nprovide the basis for acceptance or rejection of each.\n\nFor the purpose of the present discussion, we will treat the individual filaments as thin\nelastic fibers made from a homogenous elastic material. (This in itself is a rather broad\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nassumption as will be seen in the Section on Molecular Mechanics.) These fibers resist axial\nstretch as characterized by a Young's modulus Ef defined by the following relation between axial\nstress and strain:\n\nτii = Efεii\n\n(31)\n\n(summation convention not used) and resist bending as characterized by a bending stiffness Kb =\nEfI with I the moment of inertia, defined for small deflections y through,\n\n⎛d 2w\n\n⎞\nM = E f I\n=\n⎜\n⎟\nK κ\n\n⎝\nx ⎠\nb\n\n(32)\nd\nwhere x is distance measured along the axis of the fiber, w is the fiber deflection, and κ is the\ncurvature, the inverse of the radius of curvature. Eqn. (32) can be derived from the more general\nrelationships obtained in Chapter 1.2 by taking the equation relating stress and strain (Eqn. (9) or\n(10)) and setting the lateral stresses equal to zero. The Young's modulus of a filament on the\nscale of F-actin can be shown to be due to two effects that are classified by their thermodynamic\nbasis. The first is the enthalpic contribution and arises from all force interactions. The second is\ntermed the entropic contribution and is related to the probability distribution of possible\nconfigurations the molecule might exhibit. These issues are discussed in more detail in Section\nIII in the context of single molecule mechanics. For the present discussion, we will simply\nassume that the fibers to have some elastic modulus that can be measured.\n\nSome networks derive their structural integrity from an interaction between members that\nare in compression and members in tension. Some familiar large-scale examples include the\ncircus tents and the geodesic dome. In the case of the circus tent, the rigidity of the structure is\ndue to the balance between the tent poles in compression and the ropes anchored to the ground in\ntension. A simple demonstration can be constructed from wooden dowels in combination with\nelastic bands as shown in Fig. 10. In this two-dimensional model, the compression elements are\neffectively rigid; deformations occur by a rotation of the dowels and a lengthening or shortening\nof the elastic bands on the horizontally and vertically aligned members, respectively (Fig. 10b).\nThe rigidity of the structure, in this case, is related to the elastic characteristics of the tension\nelements.\nIngber [1998] has proposed that the cytoskeleton behaves like a tensegrity\nstructure with the microtubules acting in compression and the F-actin microfilaments acting in\ntension. In support of this concept, microtubules have been shown to be capable of supporting\ncompressive loads and the F-actin network exhibits behavior at junctions consistent with their\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nbeing in tension. The intermediate filaments may also be involved, although their contributions\nat this stage are unclear.\n\nDeformation\nF/2\nF/2\nL\nTension\nmember\n\nFig.10. Simple, 2-strut model of a tensegrity structure before (a) and after (b) a small\ndeformation.L\nCompression\nmembers\n\nAlthough the description of structures having many members is quite complex, simple\nstructures such as the one in Fig. 10 are more amenable to analysis. Consider the response of\nthe structure shown to the application of vertical forces at the two vertices, each of magnitude\nF/2. The structure deforms a distance δ as a result of a lengthening of the upper and lower\ntension elements, and a shortening of those on the two sides. In the deformed state, the change\nin elastic energy must equal the work done by the forces. Noting that the strain in the elastic\nelements is ε = ±δ/L (for the horizontal (+) and lateral (-) elements), and recalling from Chapter\n1.3 that the strain energy density is τε/2, the total strain energy in the deformed state is\n\nL\nL\nU ≈∫\nτ\nfε f 1a dx + ∫\nτ\nfε f 2a dx\n\n(33)\n\nwhere a is the element radius, assumed circular in cross-section, and the strains εf1 and εf2\ncorrespond to the strains in the horizontal and vertical elastic elements, respectively. If we allow\nfor a non-zero initial stress τfo in the elastic elements (equal in all elements), and assuming each\nto be linearly elastic with Young's modulus Ef, the change in elastic energy under an additional\ndeformation δ, summed for all four members and subtracted from the initial energy, gives the\nfollowing result:\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n2 δ\nΔU ~ La ⎛\n⎞\n⎜\n⎟\n⎝\n⎠(2τ\nL\nf 0 + E f )\n\n(34)\nHere the two linear contributions from Eq.

It is important to note here, that the network modulus depends both on the\nproperties of the filaments that make up the network and the network prestress. This is a unique\nproperty of a tensegrity network and distinguishes it from the other models presented in this\nchapter.\n\nWhen a more realistic three-dimensional tensegrity network (Fig. 11) is used, analysis\nagain shows that pre-stress plays a dominant role. Intuitively, it is not surprising that networks\nwith greater pre-tension in the elastic members should exhibit greater resistance to deformation.\nResults for the structure of Fig. 11 are shown in Fig. 12. Here, the effect of pre-stress is seen to\nincrease the network Young's modulus for small strains, and that only in the limit of infinite pre-\nstress does En become independent of pre-stress. Ingber and co-workers [] have shown that the\ncytoskeleton exhibits this same tendency, becoming increasingly stiff when, for example, the cell\npasses from a spherical (low pre-stress) to flattened (high pre-stress) state. Other models of\ncytoskeletal mechanics, however, might also exhibit this strain-stiffening behavior.\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nFig. 11.

T is the\nstretching force and ξ is the level of prestrain in each elastic member. Note that the stiffness, E,\nincreases with increasing prestrain, in roughly a linear manner. (Reproduced from Stamenovic, et\nal., 1996.)\n\nA potentially significant shortcoming of this model is the complete absence of any\ninfluence on elasticity of thermal fluctuations, the importance of which has been manifestly\ndemonstrated in studies of entanglement matrices and gels. Both the tensegrity model and the\ncellular solids model discussed next omit such effects. They are, however, considered in the\nmodels of biopolymer networks discussed later.\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nCellular Solids\nThe theory of cellular solids was developed for the purpose of relating the macro-mechanical\nproperties of low-density cellular materials to their micro-structural characteristics. The\napproach used is based on the concept that the material can be modeled as being comprised of\nmany \"unit cells\", one representation of which is shown in Figure 13. These unit cells are\nstaggered with struts meeting at their midpoints. It should be noted that the following analysis,\nwhile developed with the structure of Figure 13 in mind is applicable to a variety of fibrous\nmaterials with different microstructures and is not restricted to this particular geometry. When a\ncellular solid is stressed under tension or compression, the fibers act like struts and beams that\ndeform under stress as illustrated in Figure 13b.\n\nThe unit cell model in Figure 13 has struts or fiber elements of length L and cross section\nof radius a. The relative density of the material is defined by the volume fraction of solid\nmaterial, Φ. This is calculated as the solid volume contained within a unit cell (~a2L) divided by\nthe total unit cell volume (~L3) or\n\nΦ ~\n(a/L)\n\n(38)\n\nBeam theory, as developed in Chapter 1.2, gives the deflection δ of a beam of length L subject to\na force F acting at its midpoint as\n\nδ ~ FL3/(Ef,I)\n\n(39)\n\nwhere Ef is the stiffness of the beam constitutive material and I is the beam's second moment of\narea. The moment of area for a beam of thickness a is given by\n\nI ~ a4\n\n(40)\n\nThe stress τ is the force per unit area, or\n\nτ ~ F/L2\n\n(41)\n\nThe strain is related to beam deflection δ by\n\nε ~ δ/L\n\n(42)\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nUsing the results from eqns. (39), (41), and (42), the network Young's modulus or elastic\nmodulus can be expressed as\n\nEn =\nτ/ε = c1EfI/L\n\n(43)\n\nwhere c1 is a constant of proportionality. Substituting equations (38) and (40) into (43) gives:\n\nEn/Ef = c1\nΦ\n\n(44)\n\nFig. 13 Unit cell used in the cellular solids model.\n\nData from a wide range of materials and cell geometries give a value for c1 of approximately 1\n(see Fig. 14). A similar analysis for cellular materials subjected to shear stresses results in an\nexpression for the network shear modulus Gn given by Gibson & Ashby ():\n\nGn/Ef ~ c\n2Φ\n\n(45)\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nwhere c2 ~ 3/8. If the material is linearly elastic and isotropic, elasticity theory provides the\nfollowing relationship\n\nGn = En/[2(1+ν)]\n\n(46)\n\nwhich, when solved for the Poisson ratio ν, gives a value of 1/3.\n\nFig. 14. Plot of the effective Young's modulus various fibrous materials. Gibson & Ashby,\n1988.\n\nBiopolymer networks\nCytoskeletal networks can also be viewed as a polymer gel in which the matrix is considered to\nconsist of relatively straight segments connecting junctions where the filaments are either\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nchemically cross-linked, or effectively so due to entanglements. This picture has some similarity\nto the one with which we began the cellular solids analysis, but the approach employed from this\npoint on is somewhat different. Using concepts from polymer physics (see e.g., Isambert and\nMaggs, 1996) the force required to change the length of one segment of a polymer filament (F-\nactin, for example) of length Le by an amount δ can be expressed as\n\nkBTl2\nK 2\n\nFT ≈\np\n4 δ ≈\nb\nδ\nL\nk TL4\n\n(47)\ne\nB\ne\n\nwhere kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, Kb is the bending stiffness of the filament, lp\nis the persistence length, and Le is the distance between the points where the tension is applied\n(or, the distance between points of entanglement or cross-linking between network filaments).\nThis expression arises from a consideration of the curvature of the polymer resulting from\nBrownian or thermal fluctuations, and is based on the assumption that thermal energy is equally\npartitioned among the different modes of oscillation. The polymer filaments are therefore\nassumed to be bent prior to the application of stress. Externally-imposed forces either increase\nor decrease the end-to-end length of these filaments, and the deformation produced depends both\non the intrinsic bending stiffness of the filaments and on their initial degree of curvature due to\nthermal fluctuations. This can immediately be seen to differ from the approach in the cellular\nsolids model where the filaments are viewed as initially straight, lacking any significant\nthermally-induced motions, with the imposed stresses causing filament bending.\n\nFor a network comprised of such filaments in which the distance separating points at\nwhich physical bonds exist between the filaments or regions of entanglement is Le, the change in\nfilament length between bonds due to a shear strain θ (see Fig. 15) is\n\nδ ~ θLe\n\n(48)\n\nMaking use of the fact that the number of filaments per unit area parallel to the surface on which\nthe stress is applied scales inversely as the square of the characteristic mesh spacing ξ, the shear\nstress required to produce a strain θ is given by eqns. (47) and (48):\n\nτ ~ F .\nT(number of filaments)/(unit area) ~ kBTlp 2θ/(L 3\ne ξ )\n\n(49)\n\nfrom which a shear modulus of the network Gn can be determined as the ratio of stress to strain\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nGn ~ τ/θ ~ kBTlp 2/(L 3\ne ξ )\n\n(50)\n\nThe scaling of Gn clearly depends on both the distance between cross-links or entanglements and\nthe mesh size. As the concentration of polymer increases, ξ decreases and so likely does Le, at\nleast in terms of the degree of entanglement. As the concentration of actin binding protein\n(APB) increases, Le will decrease.\n\nFig. 15. A fibrous matrix being subjected to a shearing force.\n\nThe mesh spacing ξ also depends on the monomer concentration or solid fraction Φ\n(monomer volume / total volume). Assuming the filaments are stiff and homogeneously\ndispersed through the medium, this relationship can be expressed as\n\nΦ ~ (ξ a2)/\n3ξ\n\n(51)\n\nor\n\nξ ~ a/\n1/2\nΦ\n\n(52)\n\nwhere a is the monomer or filaments radius. Substituting above yields\n\nGn ~ k\nBTlp Φ/(Le a )\n\n(53)\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nIn the limit of a highly cross-linked network in which case Le ~ ξ, this leads to\n\nG\n2 .\n2 5/2\nn ~ kBTlp (Φ/a )\n\n(54)\n\nHere we see a slightly stronger dependence on volume fraction (to the 5/2 power) than exhibited\nby any of the previous models. Alternatively, we can express this in terms of the density of\ncross-links, ρc. Note that if ρc is the number of cross-links per unit volume, it should vary\ninversely with the volume associated with each bond or entanglement, i.e., as\nL -3\ne . Combining this with eqns. (52) and (53) above:\n\nGn ~ kBTlp 2Φρc/a2\n\n(55)\n\nThe Young's modulus of the network En can be obtained by a similar procedure, and can be\nshown to scale in the same manner as Gn.\n\nEquation (55) is an interesting result, and provides an opportunity to see how the addition\nof some agent such as ABP can affect cytoskeletal strength. Assuming the amount of polymer\nremains fixed, and only the degree of cross-linking changes, the change in modulus should be\nlinear in ρc. This is a speculative result at this stage, and needs to be tested by experiment.\n\n2.2.5 Fluid properties of the cytosol\n\nSo far, our discussion has focused on the protein filaments that comprise the cytoskeletal matrix\nwithin the cell, how to measure its characteristics and how it has been modeled. This matrix,\nhowever, is immersed in fluid, the cytosol, and the dynamic response of the cell is influenced by\nthe properties of this fluid. The properties that one measures, however, depend upon how the\nmeasurement is made as illustrated in the following examples.\nSeveral methods have been used to infer the viscosity of the cytosol, but here we focus on\ntwo: micropipet aspiration and dynamic light scattering. When a cell is aspirated into a\nmicropipet under a sufficiently large suction pressure that it continues to flow into the pipette,\nthe rate at which it enters can be used to determine the cytosolic viscosity. The model of the\nneutrophil used in these studies is that of a viscous droplet encapsulated in a thin shell that\nbehaves as though it was in a state of constant tension (of about 3.3x10-5 N/m) (see also Chapter\n2.4). Using this model, several investigators obtained values for cytosolic viscosity that vary\nwidely from about 10-30 Pa.s (Dong, et al., 1988) all the way up to about 200 Pa.s (Evans &\nYeung, 1989, Needham & Hochmuth, 1990), all for the same cell type, neutrophils.\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\nTsai et al, 1993, were able to reconcile some of these differences by assuming the\ncytoskeleton to behave as a power-law fluid, that is, one in which viscosity behaves according to\nthe expression\n\n⎛\n⎞\n-b\nγ\nμ = μ\nm\nc ⎜\n⎟\n\n(81)\n⎝γc ⎠\n\nwhere μc is the viscosity at a shear rate of γc and b is a constant determined from the\nexperiments. For passive neutrophils, they found the following values from seven different\nexperiments: μc = 130 +-23 Pa.s for γc =1 s\n-1 and b = 0.52+-0.09.\nThese measurements with micropipet aspiration can be contrasted with measurements\nmade by analysis of the rotations of polarized molecules introduced into the cell (Fushimi and\nVerkman, 1998) that yield a value for viscosity very near that of water, about 1.2-1.4 x10-3 Pa.s.\nThis discrepancy of roughly five orders of magnitude can be reconciled on the basis of\ndifferences in scale of the two measurement probes. When the neutrophil is drawn into the\nmicropipet, all of the cytoplasmic structures and macromolecular constituents are being caused\nto flow and affect the measured viscosity. With the high concentration of large molecular weight\nspecies that are present, it is hardly surprising that the fluid exhibits a high viscosity and non-\nNewtonian characteristics. Dynamic light scattering methods, by contrast, probe the fluid phase\nonly. Effectively, the scale of measurement is microns in the aspiration method and nanometers\nin the light scattering method. Which value for the viscosity one should use in any given\nsituation must be dictated by the nature of the problem of interest. To estimate the viscous\ninteraction between the cytoskeleton and the cytosol flowing past it, the fluid should be assumed\nto behave essentially like water. To estimate the viscous response of the cell to being squeezed\nbetween two flat surfaces, the higher value corresponding to the entire collection of constituents\nmust be used.\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n3.2.7 Nomenclature:\na - radius\nεij - infinitesimal strain tensor\neij - finite amplitude strain tensor\nE\nE\n- Young's modulus (Pa)\n- Strain energy (Nm)\nF - force (N)\nG - Shear modulus (Pa)\nk - spring constant (N/m)\nkB - Boltzmann's constant\nKb - bending stiffness (N.m)\nL - Length of filament (m)\nT - temperature (K)\nu - displacement (m)\nτij - stress tensor (Pa)\nδ - deflection during a deformation test (m)\nμ - damping constant (Ns/m)\nν - Poisson's ratio\nη - effective viscosity of a viscoelastic solid ()\nξ - filament spacing (m)\nΦ - filament solid fraction\nΘ - torque (Nm)\nC - concentration (kg/m3)\nΔp - pressure applied in micropipette aspiration (Pa)\n\nSubscripts:\nn - network\nf - filaments\n0 - initial response\ninf - long time or steady-state response\n\nCHAPTER 2.2: MECHANICS OF THE CYTOSKELETON\n(c) RD Kamm 4/5/15\n\nReferences (partial list)\n\n1.\nHall, A, Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton.

      "content": "CHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nChapter 2.3\nActive Cell Processes: Motility, Muscle, and\nMechanotransduction\n2.3.1 Introduction\nIn this chapter, we address the active processes relating to cell mechanics, where the biology and\nmechanics become inseparable. In contrast to the previous two chapters, this one will be more\nqualitative, and the models, to the extent they exist, more ad hoc. This is because not only are\nthe processes much more complex, often involving a cascade of reactions or numerous individual\ncell functions, but they are also less well understood.\nWe begin this chapter with a discussion of the various types of active cell processes\ninvolving motility in some form. These range from the motion of cilia and flagella, to\nphagocytosis, to cell migration along a substrate. Other phenomena on a smaller scale provide\nthe energy for these motions, as discussed more fully in Section 1. Models for cell motility will\nbe described next, and then the methods that have been developed to quantify it. We also\ninclude in this chapter a description of muscle and active cell contraction, beginning with a\nmacroscopic perspective, but extending down to the level of individual cross-bridge dynamics\nand the models that are used to describe it. This chapter ends with a discussion of\nmechanotransduction. Contrary to most of the literature on this topic, however, the focus here is\non the mechanisms by which force is transduced into a chemical signal, rather than on the\nsubsequent signaling cascade that leads to the ultimate response of the cell. Because these are\npoorly understood, and the hypotheses still require validation, this section should be viewed as a\nbasis for further study, and not a definitive description of known phenomena. This remains one\nof the most challenging, and fascinating, areas of biomechanics research.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n2.3.2 Cilia and Flagella\nMolecular structure. Cilia and flagella are essentially the same in terms of their internal\nstructure and the molecular mechanism by which they produce movement. The primary\ndifference is that a cell typically has only one or several flagella, whereas ciliated cells (Fig.\n2.3.1) have many cilia often as high as 109/cm2.\nFig. 2.3.1. A view looking down onto a collection of ciliated cells. (Reproduced from (Alberts,\nJohnson et al. 2002))\nTheir function differs as well. Whereas flagella are generally used for motility (e.g., sperm,\ncertain types of bacteria), cilia are most commonly found on fixed cells and are used to generate\na flow of liquid past the cell. One example is in the pulmonary airways where cilia are used to\npropel the layer of liquid that lines the airways of the lung, containing mucus, particulate matter,\nand cell debris, toward the mouth for the purpose of clearance.\nBecause they serve different purposes, they also exhibit different patterns of movement.\nCilia need to produce rectified motion of the surrounding fluid, in a direction parallel to the\nsurface of the cell. Their motion therefore, consists of a forward stroke in which they maximize\nthe force they exert by viscous drag on the external fluid by making themselves relatively\nstraight, followed by a reverse stroke in which they double up, and orient themselves nearly\ntangent to their direction of motion, to reduce drag [Fig. 2.3.2(a)]. Cilia beat nearly in synchrony,\ngiving rise to a wavelike appearance, much like the gentle undulations in a field of wheat caused\nby the wind. Flagella, by comparison, are more symmetric in their motion since their object is to\npropel the cell forward, in a direction essentially parallel to the mean axis of the flagellum [Fig.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n2.3.2(b)]. Their movement appears as a sinuous wave that propagates from the body of the cell\ntoward the tip of the cilium. The dimensions of a single filament can range from a few microns\nup to nearly 2 mm for some flagella. Their diameter, however, is quite uniform at about 0.25μm.\nFig. 2.3.2. Sketches showing the trajectory of a single cilium (left) and flagellum (right).\nMotion of the cilium is such that the rightward movement occurs when the filament is stretched\nout straight, and the leftward movement occurs when the filament is bent, tending to drive the\nsurrounding fluid from left to right. Motion of the flagellum is more symmetric as successive\nwaves appear at the point of attachment to the cell (on the left) and propagate toward the tail on\nthe right, producing a forward propulsive force on the cell.\nAll cilia and the flagella in eukaryotic cells share a common structure and move by\nmeans of bending produced in a distributed manner along their entire length with their base\nrigidly fixed at the cell body. The key to their motion is in the axoneme, a unique arrangement\nof microtubules and cross-linking proteins (Fig. 2.3.3). Commonly referred to as the \"9 + 2\"\narrangement, the microtubules form an outer circumference consisting of nine pairs. In each\npair, one of the microtubules is incomplete forming a \"CO\" type of doublet. In the center is\nlocated a pair of single microtubules. Bending deflections are produced by the outer doublets\nthat are connected by fixed cross-links (nexin) that prevent sliding, in combination with\nmoveable ciliary dynein. Dynein is a motor protein that hydrolyzes ATP to move toward the\nnegative end of a microtubule -- away from the cell body in this instance. As the dynein motors\nattempt to produce a sliding motion between adjacent microtubules in the outer ring, the stiffness\nprovided by the nexin converts the sliding motion into a bending deformation. By appropriate\ncoordination, communicated via the radial spokes (Fig. 2.3.3), the complex patterns of bending\nseen in the movements of cilia and flagella (Fig. 2.3.2) can be readily produced.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nWe should note that, by contrast, flagella in many bacteria have a different structure and\nmove by an entirely different mechanism, with the flagellum being driven by a molecular motor\nlocated at its base, powered by a flow of protons. These motors rotate at speeds as high as 100\nrevolutions per second, propelling the bacterium in a series of \"runs\" where it can move at\nspeeds of 20 μm/s for a period of about 1 second, interspersed with periods of \"tumbling\", each\nlasting about 0.1 s during which the flagellar movements are uncoordinated. An important\nstructural characteristic of bacterial flagella is their high stiffness, which is evident from their\npersistence length, which is on the order of 1 mm.\nFig. 2.3.3. Cross-sectional sketch showing the internal structure of a flagellum or cilium. Note\nthe \"9+2\" arrangement with 9 pairs of microtubules (doublets) around the outer circumference\nand one pair of single microtubules in the center. Neighboring doublets are firmly attached with\nnexin cross-links and also tethered to dynein, a motor protein (reproduced from (Lodish, Berk et\nal. 2000)).\nMechanism of thrust generation in flagella1 . As the bending wave propagates along the\nflagellum, the viscous interaction forces with the surrounding fluid give rise to a net forward\n1 The author is indebted to Prof. T.J. Pedley for his contributions to this section.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nthrust on the body (Lighthill 1969). Here we consider the bending deflection to be a wave of\nunchanging form as it propagates from the body of the cell in the rearward direction (Fig. 2.3.4).\nWe take V to be the speed of the wave in the z-direction and c its speed along s relative to the\ncenterline of the filament, so that V = αc where α is the ratio of the wavelength along z to the\nwavelength along s. The speed of the cell is -U. Therefore, to an observer traveling with a point\nof fixed wave amplitude on the wave (at speed V-U relative to the stationary fluid far from the\ncell), the speed at which a material point is observed moving forward tangent to the filament\nalong s, is c. Thus, the net velocity of a material point relative to a fixed reference frame is\n-w = (V - U)i - ct\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i is a unit vector in the z-direction and t is the unit tangent vector. To an observer sitting\non a material point, the fluid appears to be approaching at the velocity w, which can be\ndecomposed into components in the normal and tangential directions:\nw = w ⋅ n = (U - V )(i ⋅ n)\nand\nw = w ⋅ t = (U - V )(i ⋅ t ) + c\n\n(2)\n\nn\nt\nThe normal and tangential components of force (per unit length of filament) can be expressed as\nfn = Knwn and ft = Ktwt\n(3)\ns=L\nFig. 2.3.4.\nwhere Kn and Kt are the viscous drag coefficients for normal and tangential flow, respectively,\npast the local segment of filament, and Kn /Kt ≈ 2. Finally, to obtain the net force acting on the\nfilament segment in the direction of motion (the propulsion force, FP) one needs to obtain the\nforce component in the negative z direction taking the scalar product of f and i , and integrating\nalong the length of the filament:\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n= F =\nL ( f n ⋅ i + f t ⋅ i )ds\n\n(4)\n\n-FP\nz ∫\nn\nt\nCombining Eqns. (1) to (3) and recognizing that w ⋅ i = (w ⋅ n)(n ⋅ i ) + (w ⋅ t )(t ⋅ i ) , one obtains:\n-FP = (Kt - Kn )∫\nL (w ⋅ t )(t ⋅ i )ds + Kn ∫\nL (w ⋅ i )ds\n\n(5)\n\nand, with further substitution from above:\n-FP = (Kt - Kn )(U - V )∫\nL (t ⋅ i ) ds + Kn (U - V )L + Ktc ∫\nL (t ⋅ i )ds\n(6)\nwhich can be simplified to obtain:\nFP = (V - U)[(Kt - Kn )βL + KnL] - KTVL\n\n(7)\n\nwhere βL ≡∫\nL (t ⋅ i )\n2ds and αL ≡∫\nL (t ⋅ i )ds = VL /c . If we express this in dimensionless form,\nwe can write:\n⎛\nU ⎞\nFP\n= ⎜1-\n⎟[(γ - 1) + 1] -γ\n\n(8)\n\nVKnL ⎝\nV ⎠\nThe speed of motion of the cell or organism will be determined by a balance between this force\nof propulsion and the drag of the surrounding fluid on the cell. If we take the latter to have a\nform similar to that for the flagellum, we can therefore express it as UKnLδ where δ is a constant\nof order unity and Kn is the drag coefficient used in the equations above. One can then solve for\nthe dimensionless cell velocity:\nU\n(1- β)(1- γ)\n=\n(9)\nV\n1+ δ -β(1- γ)\nIn evaluating this expression, choosing the correct value of γ is troublesome, but it has been\nshown that a value of 0.5 gives reasonable agreement with many experiments [ref]. Also,\nalthough δ depends on the shape and size of the cell, if we choose δ = 1, and set β = 0.5, the ratio\nof cell speed to wave speed is 0.14.\n2.3.3 Budding of vesicles - phagocytosis, exocytosis and endocytosis\n[in progress]\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n2.3.4 Cell migration through tissues and on surfaces\nWhy do cells migrate?\nIn Chapter 2.1, the process by which leukocytes adhere to the wall of a blood vessel was\ndescribed, involving first transient adhesion and rolling, and eventually firm attachment to the\nwall, mediated by various adhesive receptor-ligand interactions. Having adhered to the\nendothelium, the cell then migrates to an intercellular junction and squeezes through a narrow\ngap typically no more than 0.1 μm wide. Once on the other side, it continues to migrate through\nthe extracellular matrix of the tissue in the direction of infection, lured by a gradient in\nchemotactic agents. Other cells may have different reasons for migration. Migration is an\nessential element in growth and development, but also plays a critical role in the metastatic\nspread of cancer cells. Fibroblasts, normally sedentary factories of extracellular matrix\ncomponents, become motile when the need arises to repair damaged tissue. Epithelial or\nendothelial cells can also be induced to migrate in order to provide a continuous protective\ncoating over newly exposed tissues. In this case, as with several other cell types, cell migration\ncan be initiated by the absence or loss of cell-cell contact, and terminated by the formation of\nnew junctions.\nWhile cell migration is essential for life, it also has a detrimental side. Cancerous cells\nmigrate from the primary tumor, enter the circulation, and eventually adhere to the vessel wall\nand migrate out into the surrounding tissue and initiate a metastatic tumor. Many recent\nexperimental treatments for cancer are directed at inhibiting the ability of tumor cells to migrate.\nExperimental measurement of cell migration\nIn a typical experiment, the migration pattern and speed of a cell over a two-dimensional\nsubstrate can be traced microscopically and mapped out as in Fig. 2.3.5. Unless a chemotactic\nsignal is present, the path of the cell as viewed over long times is random and can be described in\nterms of a diffusivity, analogous to the thermal motion of individual molecules in a gas. Over\nshort times, the cell's motion can be described as a sequence of short-duration movements in\nspecific directions interspersed with periods of random reorientation. When viewed over a\nsufficiently long time, the cell therefore appears to move randomly, losing track of the direction\nin which it was previously headed. This type of migratory pattern has been termed a persistent\nrandom walk and can be characterized by two independent parameters, a persistence time tP and\na cell speed Vc. The diffusivity of the cell motion D can be shown, on purely dimensional\ngrounds, to be proportional to Vc\n2tP. It may also be useful to think in terms of a persistence\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\ndistance, the product of persistence length and speed, as this is clearly analogous to the\npersistence length of a protein or strand of DNA as discussed in Section 1.\nDifferent cell types migrate with different speeds. Among human cells, speeds can range\nfrom as high as 20 μm/min for neutrophils, to as low as 0.2 μm/min for melanoma cells (Fig.\n2.3.6). This range can be compared to other forms of cellular motion such as the swimming of\nsperm (~ 50 μm/min) or bacteria (~500 μm/min), the movement of listeria (several hundred\nμm/s) or muscle contraction (> 10,000 μm/s).\nFig. 2.3.5.

Measured migration speed and persistence time for a variety of different cell\ntypes. [Reproduced with permission from (Lauffenburger and Linderman 1996).]\nOne method that has been employed to monitor the forces exerted by a single cell during\nmigration is by the use of a highly flexible substrate, produced by cross-linking the surface of a\nsilicone fluid pool. When cells contract, the substrate then buckles, forming what have been\ntermed \"Harris wrinkles\" (Harris 1984). While this has been useful as a qualitative\ndemonstration of cellular contractile forces, it has been difficult to obtain much quantitative\ninformation from these experiments. Contact stresses can be quantified if the cells are plated\nonto a compliant gel into which has been seeded small microspheres as markers. By monitoring\nthe displacement of each bead as a cell passes, the stress distribution that the cell exerts on the\nsubstrate can be inferred. In this way, average contact stresses have been found to fall in the\nrange of 2000 N/m2 with peak values as high as 10,000 N/m2 for a migrating 3T3\nfibroblast(Dembo and Wang 1999).\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nFig. 2.3.7. As the force required to detach a cell from its substrate (a measure of the strength of\nadhesion) increases, the cell migration speed first increases, reaches a maximum, and then falls\nsteeply. At low levels of detachment force, the cells will tend to be more rounded whereas the\nstrongly adherent ones will be in a flattened state. [Reproduced from (Palecek, Loftus et al.\n1997)]\nA model for cell migration\nJust as there exist a variety of different types of molecular motor, cells, too, exhibit a variety of\nmodes of locomotion. Some differ in obvious ways - e.g., a swimming sperm contrasted against\na migrating neutrophil -- but even among the different migrating cells significant differences\nexist. Rather than attempt to describe all the various theories and modes of migration, we focus\nhere on just one, for which reasonably strong empirical support exists.\nAny model for cell migration must incorporate the following general features:\n- Directionality. Even cells that migrate randomly exhibit periods during which it has a\ndefinite directional preference. In cells sensing a gradient in some chemoattractant, this\npreference is particularly strong, leading to a net directed movement over extended\nperiods of time. In order to accomplish this feat, the cell must become asymmetric or\npolarized in the sense that the front end undergoes processes that differ from those\noccurring near the back end.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n- Force transmission to the cell's surroundings. In order to propel itself, the cell must\nhave some means of exerting a force on the surrounding medium, be it fluid or solid. For\nthe bacteria discussed in Section 2.3.2, the interaction was mediated by the viscous drag\nbetween the flagellum and the surrounding fluid. In the case of migration on a 2\ndimensional surface, these forces are typically transmitted via the adhesion receptors\nembedded within the cell membrane, and as we have just seen, can be remarkably high.\n- Active force generation. As with nearly every directed motion, forces must be generated\nand energy is consumed. The origin of the force may occur at the molecular scale (e.g.,\nthe molecular motors discussed in Section 1), and may involve stochastic processes (e.g.,\nthe Brownian ratchet). Models need to provide a mechanism and identify the fuel for\nenergy production.\nThe following model incorporates each of these features, and is used to describe the directed\nmotion of a cell adhering to a 2-dimensional substrate. Many of the same elements may be\napplicable in 3-dimensional migration through a matrix, but we understand that process much\nless well at this point in time.\n[A wealth of images and movies showing the migration of various types of cell can be found on\nthe internet. For some interesting links, try: http://www.cellmigration.org/sciMovies.html or\nhttp://vlib.org/Science/Cell_Biology/cytoskeleton.shtml]\nPolarization. As a cell prepares for migration, it needs to become polarized, thereby identifying\nthe direction in which it will travel. It is obvious that asymmetries must develop. These\nprimarily take the form of a redistribution of cytoskeletal components (actin, microtubules), and\nadhesion receptors. The outward appearance of the cell might change as well, with gross\nasymmetries appearing, but these are most evident once the cell is under way.\nProtrusion and Adhesion. Once polarization has occurred, the stage is set for migration. The\nsimplest way to envision migration is that the cell physically reaches out from its leading edge,\nby the formation of lamellipodia (sheet-like protrusions) or filopodia (finger-like protrusions).\nOften associated with these structures, is a general ruffling or undulation near the leading edge of\nthe cell. These protrusions can occur in different ways, but the \"Brownian ratchet\" is one\nmechanism for which there is strong experimental support. In this model for protrusion, the\nactin cytoskeleton extends by polymerization to a location right adjacent to the membrane at the\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nleading edge. Both the actin filaments and the membrane, however, are fluctuating due to\nthermal motions, so the distance between the tips of the actin filaments and the membrane varies\nwith time. If local conditions are favorable for further growth of the filaments by\npolymerization, whenever the distance between the membrane and the matrix is large enough to\npermit the addition of another monomer to chain, the monomer will attach, effectively filling the\ngap and, on average, moving the location of the membrane forward. Each time another\nmonomer is added, the membrane is \"ratcheted\" to a new position and the cell progressively\nprotrudes.\nExperimental evidence supports the theory that actin polymerization plays an important\nrole in membrane protrusion. Electron microscopy of migrating cells treated with detergent to\nremove the membrane so that the actin matrix is easily visible has demonstrated that the actin\nfilaments are predominantly oriented with their barbed ends pointing toward the membrane (Fig\n2.3.9). Recall from Chapter 2.2, that actin filaments grow by polymerization at the barbed end.\nFig. 2.3.9. An electron micrograph at the leading edge (top of figure) of a migrating keratocyte\ntreated with detergent to visualize the cytoskeleton. Arrowheads indicate the polarity of the actin\nfilaments, pointed or barbed. Note that nearly all the arrowheads are pointing downward, away\nfrom the leading edge, indicating that the filaments are growing upward, from the barbed end.\nScale bar = 0.1 μm.

This might occur\nover a two-dimensional substrate, or through a three-dimensional matrix, where the details of\nattachment might differ, but the result is the same. Adhesion is typically accomplished via a\nvariety of transmembrane receptors of the integrin family, forming what are called focal\nadhesion complexes. These complexes can be highly transient, forming and dissipating as the\ncell progresses, the process mediated by a collection of signaling proteins (e.g., Rac and Cdc42).\nSome, however, persist and form an anchor for actin filaments in the main body of the cell,\nthereby providing a means of attaching the intracellular cytoskeleton directly to the surrounding\nmatrix.\nExample on the rates of actin polymerization and comparison to cell migration speeds. (Howard)\nContraction. As the cell reaches forward and grabs hold, it must then pull its body forward in\norder to make progress. This action likely involves the actin-myosin II system, at least in some\ncell types. In Chapter 1.3, it was demonstrated how myosins can effectively walk along an actin\nfilament. Clusters of bi-polar myosin II filaments have been identified in association with the\nactin matrix, and concentrated in the region between the protruding lamellipodia and the main\nbody of the cell. In this same region, the actin matrix is observed to undergo a transition from a\nmore or less random orientation to one in which the filaments are primarily oriented parallel to\nthe leading edge and at higher concentration. Immediately behind this zone, the actin\nconcentration falls off rapidly, presumably indicating depolymerization into actin monomers that\ncan then diffuse forward to once again fuel the polymerization at leading edge.\nWhile the precise mechanism by which actin-myosin interactions produce this\ncontraction of the cytoskeletal matrix is not clear, it seems likely that myosin II plays a role in\nactin filament reorganization, and in the process, contracting the matrix, pulling the front and\nrear portions of the cell together. One example of how this might occur is shown in Fig. 2.3.10.\nThe myosin molecules shown in the figure are each adherent to two filaments and move along\nboth toward the positive or barbed end. As they do, depending on the orientation of the actin\nfilaments, the myosin might cause the actin matrix to collapse by bringing the filaments closer\ntogether. This type of collapse can condense the actin matrix into a collection of parallel\nfilaments and in the process, produce contraction in the direction of cell motion.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nactin filament\nbipolar myosin II\nFig. 2.3.10. One example of how the movement of bipolar myosin II along a pair of actin\nfilaments can lead to condensation of the actin into a band of nearly parallel filaments.\nForces generated by actin-myosin mediated contraction, in non-muscle cells, of about\n103-104 N/m2 ((Felder and Elson 1990) (Kolodney and Wysolmerski 1992)) are transmitted fore\nand aft via the actin matrix, ultimately creating a force in the adhesion receptors. The net result\nof this contraction and force transmission is a rearward directed force on the external\nenvironment (e.g., the substrate or extracellular matrix) in the front part of the cell, and a forward\ndirected force in the back, setting the stage for the next phase, rear release.\nRear release. Release of the uropod or trailing edge of the cell is mediated by cell polarization in\nthat there must exist an asymmetry in the adhesion strength, either by means of a relative\nincrease in density of adhesion complexes toward the leading edge, or an increase in the strength\nper bond. Either of these will lead to the situation in which the forward parts of the cell are\ncapable of sustaining higher levels of force than the trailing regions, leading to the bonds at the\ntrailing end giving way, allowing the cell to contract in the direction of movement.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nMigration through a three-dimensional matrix. Although the process just described appears to\nexplain much of what is seen during cell migration on a flat, two-dimensional substrate, the\nprocess of migration through a three-dimensional matrix, as is more common in vivo, may differ\nin some important respects. We know very little about how cells make their way through the\nextracellular matrix, but recent experiments (Cukierman, Pankov et al. 2001) have led to some\ninteresting observations. The nature of cell attachment appears to be critically dependent on the\nthree-dimensionality of the matrix, its pliability, and its composition. Adhesion complexes in 3D\nmatrices composed of natural, extracellular matrix materials, have a different composition\n(favoring the α5β1 integrin), different morphology (are more elongated and spindle-shaped), and\ntend to produce stronger attachments. Other adhesion-mediated activities also are affected such\nas migration speed and proliferation rates. While these studies of adhesion and migration in 3D\nmatrices are just beginning, they suggest that much of what we have learned from 2D culture\nmay not be fully applicable to the in vivo situation.\nExample: Why is there an optimal level of adhesion for cell migration?\nWe can solidify some of these concepts by way of the following simple model for cell migration\nthat leads to a scaling law useful in the interpretation of the effect on migration speed of cell-\nsubstrate adhesion strength. We know from discussions in Chapter 2.2, that cell shape can be\naltered by the strength of adhesion to a substrate. Less adherent cells tend to be more spherical\nand have a smaller region of contact with the substrate than more strongly adherent cells. We\nhave also seen above (Fig. 2.3.7) that there appears to exist an optimum in adhesion strength for\ncell migration, in that the speed of cell migration falls if the cells become either more or less\nadherent than the optimum. How then, is the adhesion strength related to the speed of a\nmigrating cell?\nConsider the cell in Fig. 2.3.11, migrating on substrates with varying degrees of\nadhesiveness, either through variations in ligand concentration or by the use of different ligands\nwith different affinities to the cell. For high levels of adhesion, the cell will be in a flattened\nconfiguration so that its aspect ratio, height-to-diameter, is low. For poorly adhesive conditions,\nthe cell will become more rounded with an aspect ratio approaching unity. In both cases we\nconsider the cell to be of constant volume with a region of adhesion of linear dimension d.\nIn order to proceed with the model, we need to make some assumptions. First, we\nassume that the cell migrates due to the work done by actin-myosin interactions inside the cell as\ndescribed by the contraction phase above, and that the primary form of energy dissipation is by\nmeans of viscous shear stress inside the cell, viewed for this purpose as a viscous drop. We\nneglect, therefore, any differences in energy between the new bonds being formed at the leading\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nedge and those breaking at the trailing edge, while at the same time recognizing the need for\nsome degree of asymmetry in bonding strength. Consequently, the energy loss is due to the\nviscous contribution which we will assume scales in the same manner as in a viscous fluid.\nViscous energy dissipation per unit volume scales as the product of the fluid viscosity and the\nsquare of the velocity gradients, or:\n⎛∂v⎞\nΦ ∝μ\n(10)\n⎝∂x⎠\nFor the purpose of an order-of-magnitude estimate, we take the relevant velocity scale to be the\ncell speed, V, and arbitrarily for now define a length scale x over which the velocity changes\noccur. The rate of energy dissipation can therefore be approximated as the product of\nΦ, obtained by introducing these scaled variables into the expression above, and the volume\nwithin which the dissipation occurs, V .\nThe scalings for x and V depend on the particular state of the cell, whether it is in a\nrounded or flattened state. If rounded [Fig. 2.3.11(a)], most of the velocity gradients are\nconfined to a region in the vicinity of the adhesion zone, so x ~ a and V ~ a3, leading to the\nfollowing expression for the total rate of energy dissipation:\n⎛V ⎞\n∫ΦdV ∝μ\n⎠ a\nfor a rounded cell.\n(11)\n⎝a\nIf sufficiently flattened [Fig. 2.3.11(b)], the velocity gradient will occur over the entire height of\nthe cell, h, and dissipation will occur in the entire cell volume, ha2, leading to:\n⎛V ⎞\n∫ΦdV ∝μ⎝h ⎠ ha\nfor a flattened cell.\n(12)\nAn overall energy balance must exist. Therefore, based on the assumptions of the model, the\nrate of energy dissipation must be balanced by the rate at which work is done by the actin\nmyosin interactions. This can be expressed as a product of the force generated and the speed of\ncontraction within the cell. The contraction speed is simply the cell migration speed, V. To\nestimate the force, recognize that in order to migrate at all, the forces must be sufficient to break\nthe receptor-ligand bonds at the trailing edge of the cell. Consequently, the force generated\nwithin the cell must scale as the product of the adhesion force per unit area, and the area of\nadhesion. Combining these gives the following expression for the rate at which work is done by\nthe molecular motors:\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nFV ∝γa\n2V\n\n(13)\nwhich can be equated to either of the two expressions given above for the rate of energy\ndissipation to yield the following scaling relationships:\nV ∝γd\n\nfor a rounded cell,\n(14)\nμ\nand\nV ∝γh ∝γ\n2 ⋅ (ha\n2) for a flattened cell.\n(15)\nμ\nμa\nIn the last of these terms, the (constant) volume of the cell has been factored out explicitly.\nInspection of these expressions shows that as the area of contact to the substrate increases, as a\nconsequence of an increase in the adhesiveness of the substrate, the speed of the cell will at first\nincrease, pass through a maximum, then decrease.\nThe expression above for a nearly spherical cell can also be combined with the result\nfrom Chapter 2.1 from JKR theory(Johnson, Kendall et al. 1971). Assuming the energy of\nadhesion per unit area (J) can be related to the force of adhesion per unit area (γ) through a\ncharacteristic length of deformation of the adhesive \"spring\", denoted as δs, we can re-write the\nfirst expression in the form:\nR\n1/ 2 1/3\n⎛ γ\n4δ s\n⎞\nV ∝⎜\n⎟\nfor a rounded cell.\n(16)\n⎝ μ 3E ⎠\nHere again, it can be seen that an increase in adhesion force leads to an increase in migration\nspeed for a rounded cell. Because of the assumption of small deformation in JKR theory,\nhowever, it would be inappropriate to use it for the flattened cell.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n2.3.5 Muscle contraction\nLinking macroscopic behavior to microscopic phenomena\nThroughout this text, we have attempted to describe the mechanical properties and behavior of a\nbiological material on the basis of its molecular composition and phenomena that occur on a\nmolecular scale. Muscle provides an ideal opportunity to reinforce that integrative approach.\nStudies over the years have provided a wealth of information on muscle performance in a variety\nof situations, have clearly identified its structure at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels, and\nhave elucidated the fundamental mechanisms of muscle activation and the actin-myosin\ninteractions that produce contractile force. In this section, we summarize some of what is\ncurrently known with a focus on skeletal muscle, the other types being cardiac muscle and\nsmooth (non-striated) muscle used to constrict arteries, airways and other organs. The reader\nshould recognize, however, that the basic concepts are more generally applicable to these other\ntypes of muscle as well.\nObservations of muscle on a macro-scale\nMuscle can be thought of as having two structural elements that act in parallel: the contractile\ncells and the fibrous tissue that surrounds them. The cells are relatively compliant when non\nactivated, and the fibrous tissue therefore dominates the elastic behavior of relaxed muscle. In\nthat situation, an intact muscle exhibits a behavior quite similar to that of other fibrous tissues in\nthat the slope of the static stress-strain curve steepens with increasing stretch (Fig. 2.3.12), lower\ncurve) due to progressive recruitment of an increasing number of extracellular matrix fibers. It\nhas been observed that muscle, like many other biological materials, stiffens in such a way that\nthe slope of the stress-strain (σ-ε) relation increases linearly with extension satisfying the\nrelationship:\ndσ = α σ( + β )\n(17)\ndε\nwhere α and β are empirically-based constants. Integrating, one obtains the following simple\nconstitutive law for relaxed muscle:\nCeαε -β\nσ =\n(18)\nwhere C is a constant of integration.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nWhen muscle is maximally stimulated, or tetanized, and the force is measured as a\nfunction of length, the contribution of the muscle cells becomes dominant. As can be seen by the\ndifference between the upper and lower curves in Fig. 2.3.12, that active contribution attains a\nmaximum when the muscle is at its resting length (l/l0=1) and falls to zero when l/l0 is\napproximately < 0.5 or > 1.8. This defines the range of muscle lengths over which active\ncontraction can generate additional force, the reason for which will become apparent when we\nexamine the microarchitecture of a sarcomere, the fundamental unit of contraction.\nFig. 2.3.12. The relationship\nbetween tension (normalized to\nmaximum tension) and length\n(normalized to rest length) in an\nisolated muscle. Lower curve:\nrelaxed. Upper curve: maximally\nconstricted (tetanized) muscle.\n[Reproduced from T.A.\nMcMahon, \"Muscles, Reflexes,\nand Locomotion\".]\nIt is important to emphasize that up to now we have been discussing the static force\nproduced by muscle at a given fixed length, under so-called isometric conditions. More\ncommonly, however, muscles are used in situations in which they simultaneously generate force\nand are either contracting or elongating, as in the act of riding a bicycle, running, or lifting a\nweight. As might be expected, the force that can be generated at any given length depends, in\naddition, on the rate at which the muscle is changing length, its contraction velocity. This is\ntypically characterized by the force-velocity curve for the muscle (Fig. 2.3.13) that expresses the\nforce generated, F, normalized by the force produced under isometric conditions at a given\nlength, Fmax, as a function of the shortening velocity, v, normalized by the maximum rate of\ncontraction that occurs at zero force, vmax. Note that the curve is extended into the range of\nnegative velocities to encompass the case in which the muscle is activated but lengthening since\nthe applied force exceeds Fmax. When expressed in this dimensionless form, the force-velocity\nrelationship, known as Hill's equation(McMahon 1984), takes the form:\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nv\n1- (F F\n)\nmax\n\n(19)\n\n=\nv\n1+ C F F\n)\nmax\n(\nmax\nwhere C is a dimensionless constant with values in the range of 4 to 6. Given this relationship\nbetween force and the velocity of shortening, we can also compute the normalized power\ngenerated by the muscle, which is simply the product of the two:\nvF\n1-(F F\n)\n=\nmax\n\n(20)\n\nv\nF\n(F\nF) + C\nmax\nmax\nmax\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2.3.13, the normalized power produced by muscle reaches a maximum of\nabout 0.1 when F/Fmax ~ 0.3. That a maximum exists for an intermediate value of force or\nshortening velocity simply reflects what we already know from experience, that we can\nmaximize our speed on a bicycle by selecting the appropriate gear.\nFig. 2.3.13. Hill's\nequation (majenta) [in\nnormalized form, eqn.\n(19)] characterizing the\nrelationship between the\nforce generated by\ncontracting muscle and\nthe speed of contraction.\nAlso shown is the\nnormalized power\nproduced by the muscle\n(blue) [eqn. (20)], which\npeaks at a contracting\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nvelocity about 25% of\nv/vmax\nthe maximum.\nTemporal patterns of behavior\nAll the discussion above pertains to the conditions of maximal stimulus, that is, the condition in\nwhich the rate of muscle stimulation is sufficiently high that the muscle is constantly producing\nthe maximum force of which it is capable for the given length and rate of shortening. Obviously,\nunder normal activity skeletal muscle is not always maximally stimulated.

The mechanism by which a muscle cell is activated is discussed later in this section; for\nnow, consider the forces produced by the muscle as the rate of stimulus is gradually increased.\nConsider an experiment in which a single muscle fiber is isolated and mounted at constant length\nin a system in which the force generated can be monitored over time. If a single activating pulse\n(electrical stimulus) is applied, the muscle exhibits a single twitch of short duration, lasting on\nthe order of one second (Fig. 2.3.14). If a periodic sequence of pulses is applied, the force builds\nto a higher level, and oscillates about some mean value. As the rate of stimulation is increased,\nthe mean level of force increases and the magnitude of oscillation decreases, until reaching a\nstate of tetanus in which the force achieves a maximum magnitude and the oscillations\ndisappear. In mammalian muscle, tetanus is achieved when the rate of stimulation exceeds about\n50 Hz.\nFig. 2.3.14. Temporal pattern of\nforce generation when a muscle\nfiber is excited once (twitch), at a\nlow frequency (unfused tetanus),\nand higher frequencies, eventually\nproducing fused tetanus.\n[Reproduced from McMahon\ntext.]\nThe source of energy for muscle\nJust as an automobile engine burns hydrocarbon fuel to generate power, muscle, the engine of\nour body, also extracts power from a chemical reaction. Both do work, and also simultaneously\ngenerate heat that must constantly be eliminated while work is being done. The biological fuel\nthat muscles consume to do work is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the biochemical reaction\nthat accompanies muscle contraction is the hydrolysis of ATP creating adenosine diphosphate\n(ADP):\nATP ⎯ ⎯ ⎯⎯→ ADP + Pi\nactomy sin\nATPase\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nwhere Pi is the phosphate ion. This reaction has an equilibrium constant, Keq = 4.9x105 M which\nstrongly favors the production of ADP. This can also be expressed in terms of the change in free\nenergy, ΔG that occurs during the reaction:\n⎛\n[ATP]\n⎞\nΔG = ΔG0 -kT ln⎜\n⎟\n\n(21)\n⎝[ADP [ ]\n] Pi ⎠\nwhere ΔG0 = -54x10-21 J (expressed as the change in free energy per molecule). At typical\nconcentrations inside the cell, ΔG takes on a value of -101x10-21 J or -25kBT.\nAs ATP is converted to ADP, it is continually being replenished through what is known\nas the Lohmann reaction in which ADP combines with phosphocreatine (PCr) to produce ATP\nand creatine (Cr):\nADP + PCr←⎯ ⎯\nCPK →ATP + Cr\na reaction that is catalyzed by creatine phosphokinase (CPK). The equilibrium constant for this\nreaction is high, Keq = 20, therefore strongly favoring the production of ATP. PCr must also be\nresynthesized, which is accomplished by a process involving carbohydrates and sugars\n(Lehninger, Nelson et al. 2000).\nWhen an overall energy balance is performed under a wide range of different\nexperimental conditions, it is observed that the sum of the work done and the heat generated is\ndirectly proportional to the rate at which PCr is converted. Thus, it appears that the majority of\nenergy used in muscle contraction is derived from PCr and its reaction with ADP.\nStructure of muscle in its various forms\nTaking skeletal, striated muscle again as an example, we consider muscle structure starting at the\nlargest length scale, that of the entire functional muscle unit, such as the biceps brachii.\nExternally, the muscle attaches to the associated bone via tendons, and its contraction causes the\narm to bend at the elbow. Looking at higher magnification, we find that the muscle is actually\ncomprised of a collection of muscle fibers, each of which is a single, multi-nucleated cell about\n10-50 μm in diameter that often extend the entire length of the muscle, a distance measured in\ncentimeters. Even at this scale, however, organization at the molecular level begins to become\napparent through the striations associated with the sarcomeric structure. These come into clearer\nview at the next level down in scale; on higher magnification, it can be seen that the muscle fiber\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nStriated muscle structure from Zubay, et al. Biochemistry 3rd Edition\nis comprised of a bundled collection of individual myofibrils, each measuring roughly 1-2 μm in\ndiameter. Here, the sarcomeres can be clearly delineated and the following structures defined\n(see Fig. 2.3.15):\n- I-band - a region of low refractive index containing just actin (thin) filaments,\ndivided into two equal parts by the Z-disk, a structural membrane that anchors the\nactin filaments and runs through the entire muscle fibril.\n- A-band - a region mostly of higher refractive index that extends the entire length\nof the myosin (thick) filaments and including a region of overlapping actin and\nmyosin filaments. The A-band contains the H-zone and the M-line.\n- H-zone - the portion of the A-band in which only myosin filaments are found,\ncontaining the M-line where myosin filaments are structurally linked to each\nother.\nThe total length of a sarcomere is about 2 μm at rest but varies, as will be seen below, as the\nmuscle shortens or lengthens.\nActin and myosin filaments constitute the molecular motors of muscle. Actin filaments\nare comprised of f-actin, a double helical actin filament of the type found in the cytoskeleton.\nThick filaments are made from myosin and arranged in such a way that their long tails merge\nwith the main filament so that the head domains are sticking out, enabling them to interact with\nthe actin filaments. When viewed in cross-section, at a position where the thick and thin\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nfilaments overlap, the pattern consists of a centrally located myosin thick filament, surrounded\nby xx actin thin filaments. Electron micrographs also show the myosin heads bonding with the\nactin filament at specific binding sites. For a complete description of the molecular structures of\nactin and myosin, see Section 1 and Chapter 2.2.\nFig. 2.3.15. Structure of sarcomeres within a muscle cell. ( a) Electron micrograph. (b) Sketch\nshowing the relative arrangement of the actin and myosin filaments within a sarcomere. (c) A\nhigher magnification TEM showing the myosin cross bridges spanning between the actin thin\nfilament and myosin thick filament (Reproduced from Lodish et al).\nCardiac muscle is also striated, but the contractile cells (myocytes) are shorter and\ncontain a single nucleus. They attach to and communicate with neighboring myocytes through\nstructures called inter-calated discs to produce a coordinated, synchronous contraction, initiated,\nas in skeletal muscle, by a release of Ca2+. Smooth muscle is a more primitive form and differs\nfrom both skeletal and cardiac muscle by the absence of striations. These single nucleated cells\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nare spindle-like in appearance, but are less ordered in their arrangement. Contraction occurs\nmore gradually, but can lead to greater overall levels of shortening.\nMuscle activation\nCalcium ions (Ca2+) provide the molecular trigger that initiates muscle contraction. At rest in a\nnon-activated muscle fiber, Ca2+ is primarily contained in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, consisting\nof two parts, the longitudinal tubules and the transverse tubules, which are actually extended\ninvaginations of the outer membrane. Longitudinal tubules run largely parallel to the\nsarcomeres, but expand into larger sacs or bulges in the vicinity of the Z-line. Muscle\nstimulation depolarizes the sarcolemma (the outer membrane of the muscle fiber), which causes\na sudden increase in the permeability of the longitudinal tubules, releasing Ca2+ into the\nsarcoplasm to promote actin-myosin interactions.\nCalcium initiates contraction through the action of the troponin complex consisting of\ntroponins T, I and C (Troponin-binding, Inhibitory, and Calcium-binding, respectively). When\nboth troponins I and T are bound to actin, myosin is inhibited from binding whether or not Ca2+\nis present. But with the addition of troponin C, binding to Ca2+ releases the inhibition and actin\nmyosin binding can readily occur with a high affinity.\nSoon after contraction is initiated, Ca2+ concentration is rapidly brought back to initial\nresting levels as calcium ions are taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The Ca2+ ion spike\ntypically precedes contraction.\nThe sliding filament model\nBinding of the troponin complex to actin, coupled with an ample supply of Ca2+ released from\nthe sarcoplasmic reticulum, sets the stage for muscle contraction and force generation. This is\naccomplished by means of a relative sliding motion between the actin and myosin filaments\nduring which the myosin heads periodically attach to and are released from binding sites on the\nactin filaments. The history of this discovery is a fascinating story. It was in 1954 that Andrew\nHuxley and Ralph Niedergerke (Huxley and Niedergerke 1954), and Hugh Huxley and Jean\nHanson (Huxley and Hanson 1954) simultaneously, but independently, published papers in the\njournal Nature describing what has now come to be known as the sliding filament model of\nmuscle contraction. In their theory, now supported by a still growing body of work, they\nproposed the general structure of muscle as depicted in Fig. 2.3.15(b), and described for the first\ntime the arrangement of the actin and myosin filaments and their relative movement during\nmuscle contraction. Through extensions to this theory, it has become clear that the myosin head\nprotruding from the thick filament sequentially binds with the actin thin filament, changes\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nconformation producing a net relative motion between the filaments, detaches, finally returning\nto its initial conformation to begin another cycle with a different actin binding site. This is a\nprocess repeated over and over again, producing a net progressive displacement or sliding\nmotion between the actin and myosin filaments.\nFig. 2.3.16. A model for the cyclic process leading\nto relative motion between the actin and myosin\nfilaments. See text for description. [Reproduced\nfrom, Lodish et al., Molecular Cell Biology, 2000.]\nTo better appreciate this process, consider the sequence of events depicted in Fig. 2.3.16,\nbeginning at a point in the cycle where a myosin head is tightly bound to an adjacent actin\nfilament. Before long, ATP binds to myosin, and a conformational change reduces the affinity of\nmyosin to actin and the two separate, simultaneously causing the myosin to shift a distance of\nabout 5 nm toward the positive end of the actin filament during the power stroke where it rebinds\nat a new location. Hydrolysis then causes the release of one phosphate ion from the ATP\n(producing ADP) and the associated conformational change triggers the power stroke that drives\nthe actin filament in the direction of its negative end, generating a force that can be as high as 1.5\npN at zero velocity. During the power stroke, the ADP is released returning the myosin to its\noriginal state, ready for the next ATP to come along and bind. In fact, each myosin only spends\na relatively small fraction of its time bound to actin, even during active muscle contraction. This\nis made possible by the fact that each actin and myosin filaments have multiple sites of\ninteraction so that even though many sites are free at any given instant, the contraction continues\ndue to the fraction that happen to be attached at that time.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nA quantitative model for cross bridge dynamics\nA few years after the sliding filament model was proposed, in 1957, A. Huxley published another\npaper in which he presented a quantitative model for cross bridge dynamics (Huxley 1957).\nThough subject to some minor modifications over the years, this model is still widely used to\ndescribe the macroscopic behavior of muscle from a molecular perspective. Here we present a\nslightly modified version of the original model of Huxley, drawing from the presentations of T.\nMcMahon (McMahon 1984) and J. Howard (Howard 2001).\nCertain assumptions are made in order to make the problem tractable:\n- While in the bound state, the myosin head behaves as though loaded by linear springs\nwith spring constant, κ, and that it passes through the necessary biochemical processes\nincluding binding of ATP, ATP hydrolysis, and release of ADP.\n- Only the case of constant (time-invariant) relative sliding velocity and force generation is\nconsidered.\n- The muscle is assumed to be maximally activated throughout.\n- Attachment and detachment is assumed to obey simple kinetics.\n- Effects of other elastic components in the muscle are ignored.\nFollowing these assumptions, we begin by considering a single myosin head and its interaction\nwith a single actin filament (Fig. 2.3.17), noting that the nomenclature used here is summarized\nat the end of the chapter. As pictured, the myosin head binding site is attached to springs having\na combined spring constant κ, the resting (zero force) position of which is at x = 0. When the\nmyosin and actin are bound and the position of the complex is x, the force acting is κx to the left\nMyosin filament\nActin filament\nx\nMyosin head\nActin binding site\nFig. 2.3.17. Schematic used for the model of cross-bridge dynamics. As the actin\nfilament moves past the myosin filament, the myosin head can bind to it at the red\ntriangle. When it does, the springs are either stretched or compressed and a force κx\nacts at the binding site.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nand the power stroke consists of the complex moving from a position x = h where binding first\noccurs, to some value of x ≤ 0 where the two detach. Therefore, for values of x < h, the\nprobability that a given cross bridge is attached, n(x), is governed by the rate equation:\ndn(x,t)\n∂n(x,t)\n∂n(x,t)\n=\n- v\n= [1- n(x,t)]k (x) - n(x,t)k- (x)\n(22)\ndt\n∂t\n∂x\n+\nexpressed here in general, time-dependent form, explicitly recognizing that n(x,t) can change\neither due to the formation of new bonds (first term on the RHS) or the detachment of existing\nones (second term), and where -v = dx/dt. Since we are interested in the steady state in which n\n= n(x), this can be re-written as:\ndn(x)\n-v\n= [1- n(x)]k+ (x) - n(x)k- (x)\n\n(23)\ndx\nwhich requires forms for the rate constants k+(x) and k-(x) for solution. To simplify the analysis,\nwe use the forms suggested by Pate et al. (Pate, White et al. 1993) in which k- (x) = k-\n0 = const.\nfor x < 0 and zero elsewhere, and k+ (x) = k+\n0 = const. for h-x0 < x <h and zero elsewhere (see\nfigure). This equation therefore describes the situation in which a free actin binding site\napproaches from the right, encounters a myosin head that it may or may not bind to over the\nshort distance x0. If it attaches, it remains so during the time that the bonded complex travels\nleftward a distance h to the position x = 0. As it passes into the region x < 0, it for the first time\nhas an opportunity to detach and the probability of attachment, n(x), progressively falls,\napproaching zero in the limit of large negative values of x. Using these forms for the rate\nconstants, n(x) is determined by solution of Eqn. (23) in four distinct regions:\nx > h:\nIn this region the actin-binding site is approaching the free myosin head, unoccupied. Since both\nk+ and k- are zero, no binding occurs:\nn(x) = n(h) = 0\n\n(24)\nh-x0 < x <h:\nIf binding is to occur, it has to do so, according to the present simple model, within this narrow\nregion where the binding rate constant is large, described by the equation:\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\ndn\n-v\n= (1- n)k\n\n(25)\ndx\n+\nthat can be solved by isolating terms in (n-1) on the LHS and integrating over the specified\nlimits:\n-1\nh\nd(n - 1)\nk+\n∫\n= ∫\ndx\n(26)\nn - 1\nv\nn(0)-1\nh- x0\nresulting in the following expression for the probability that, having passed through the region of\nattachment, a complex is actually formed:\n⎛\n⎞\nk\nn(0) = 1- exp⎜-\n+ x0 ⎟\n(27)\n⎝\nv ⎠\nNote that the faster the actin filament travels, the lower the probability of forming a bond.\nrate\nconstants\nx0\nx = h\nx\n0 < x < h-x0\nWithin this zone, both the attachment and detachment rate constants are zero, so the myosin head\ncan neither bind to nor detach from an actin filament, and probability of attachment remains\nconstant:\nn(x) = n(0) = constant\n\n(28)\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nx < 0\nAs the complex moves into the region x < 0, the force of interaction sustained at the actin\nmyosin bond changes sign and its probability of attachment begins to fall, as described by the\nequation:\ndn\n-v\n= -k-n\n\n(29)\ndx\nIsolating terms in n on the LHS and integrating between x and 0:\nn(0)\ndn\nk-\n∫\n= ∫\ndx\n(30)\nn\nv\nn(x)\nx\nwe obtain the solution:\nk 0\n⎛\n⎞ ⎡\n⎛\n⎞⎤\n⎛\nx ⎞\nk- x\n+x0\nk-\nn(x) = n(0)exp ⎜\n⎟= ⎢1-exp⎜-\n⎟⎥exp⎜\n⎟\n\n(31)\n⎝ v ⎠ ⎣\n⎝\nv ⎠⎦\n⎝ v ⎠\nafter some reorganization and using Eqn.

In doing so, we seek an expression for the work done by a segment of muscle\ncorresponding to half the length of a single sarcomere (s/2), that shortens a distance l, taken to be\nthe distance between sites along a thick filament where actin-myosin binding can occur; l is\nchosen in this way so that each cross-bridge has the opportunity to go through just a single cycle.\nTherefore, the work done by this segment, of cross-sectional area A, contracting at constant total\nforce σA is:\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\ninf\nσlA = ∫[n(x)ρsAs /2]κxdx\n\n(33)\n-inf\nwhere ρs is the density of cross-bridges (#/volume).

Huxley, and as he demonstrated,\ndespite the different algebraic form, can be fit to the experimental measurements made on\nmuscle, previously described as Hill's equation [see eqn. (19)]. For purposes of comparison and\nto cast this result in a more convenient dimensionless form, we can use eqn.

Here we take a somewhat narrower view and use the more\ncircumspect definition of \"transduction\", taking it to be the event that transduces the mechanical\nperturbation into a change in concentration of some chemical species. While obviously at the\nheart of all mechanotransduction processes, this step is also arguably the least well understood.\nHere we describe what is known, largely in the context of sensory perception, but also include\nsome more speculative ideas relating to the response of non-sensory cells. We have come to\nappreciate over time, that virtually all nucleated cells possess the capability to respond to\nmechanical force. What we do not yet fully understand, however, is the physical basis for the\nresponse, nor the extent to which different types of cells respond through similar mechanisms.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nSensory cells\nHearing is perhaps the most-studied, and most completely understood, example of how cells can\nrespond to a mechanical stimulus. The picture that has emerged from these studies is of a system\nwith exquisite sensitivity and a remarkable range. Sound with energy levels as low of 4x10-21 J,\n(sound pressure levels of about 2.5x10-5 Pa) comparable to thermal noise, can be detected by the\nhuman ear, as well as sounds with intensities 13 orders of magnitude times as large (!), at the\nthreshold of pain. Spectral sensitivity in humans ranges from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, and even\nwider ranges are sensed by other species.\nSound is transmitted in the form of vibrations from the tympanic membrane, via the\nossicles of the middle ear (hammer, anvil and stirrup), ultimately producing oscillations in the\noval window. These, in turn, excite waves of fluid motion that propagate through a snail-shell\nshaped structure called the cochlea. In cross-section, the cochlea can be seen to be comprised of\nthree chambers, the central one being the cochlear duct that contains the organ of corti (Fig.\n2.3.19). Transduction of mechanical motion into a biochemical, then electrical signal occurs at\nthe level of the stereocilia present in individual hair cells that reside in the organ of corti and\nrespond to the motion of the basilar and tectoral membranes as waves propagate down the liquid-\nfilled channels of the cochlea. Stereocilia are actin-filled microvilli that organize into a cone-\nshaped bundle (Fig. 2.3.19) and can extend up to 30 μm from the cell surface.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nFig. 2.3.19. Top: A collection of stereocilia extending from the surface of a single hair cell. The\nresulting bundle extends about 30 μm from the cell surface. [Reproduced from Hudspeth\nwebsite.] Bottom: How a force acting on two neighboring stereocilia gives rise to an increased\ntension in the tip link. The tip link is thought to attach to a stretch-activated channel at one or\nboth ends so that an increase in tip link tension activates the channel(s). [Reproduced from\nGarcia-Anoveros & Corey, Ann Rev Neurosci, 1997.]\nSound is transduced in the hair bundle by the opening of stretch-activated potassium channels\nalong the stereocilia caused by a shearing displacement of one stereocilium relative to another\n(Fig. 2.3.19). Relative motion produced by shearing induces a force in thin filaments that\nconnect the tip of one stereocilium to a gated channel in its neighbor. This presumably leads to a\nconformational change in the transmembrane protein that comprises the channel, causing it to\nopen. Measurements suggest that the force required to open the channel is only about 2 pN,\ncorresponding to a displacement at the channel of about 4 nm (Hudspeth).\nOpening of the channel can be viewed as a transition between two ensembles of\nconformational states, or structural states, corresponding to the open (1) and closed (2)\nconditions. Since each structural state (open or closed) can have a number of conformational\nstates, the transition between structural states must be analyzed in terms of the difference in free\nenergy G = U - TS where U is the average potential energy of the ensemble of conformational\nstates in a single structural state and S is its entropy. It can be shown that the probability of\nexisting in one structural state or another also satisfies Boltzmann's law, so that\nexp(Gi / kBT)\npi =\n(39)\n∑ exp(Gi / kBT)\ni\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nSo that the ratio of probabilities is\n⎡\n⎤\nΔG\np2 = exp⎢-\n⎥\n(40)\np1\n⎣ kBT⎦\ntaking p1 and p2 to be the closed and open states, respectively, and ΔG the difference in free\nenergy between them. If the transition from closed to open states corresponds to a movement of\ndistance Δx along the direction in which the force F acts, then the difference in free energy\nbetween the two states is:\nΔG ≅ΔG\n0 - FΔx\n\n(41)\nwhere ΔG0 corresponds to the difference in free energy between states without an external force.\nRecognizing that the channel is either open or closed, so that p1 = 1 - p2, and letting Keq be the\nequilibrium constant in the absence of force, we can write:\n⎡ FΔx⎤\np2\n= K\nexp⎢\n(42)\neq\n⎥\n1- p2\n⎣ kBT ⎦\nand when solved for the probability that the channel is open:\n=\n(43)\np2\n⎡\n⎤\nFΔx\n1+\nexp⎢-\n⎥\nKeq\n⎣ kBT ⎦\nAssuming the channel is normally closed, Keq << 1, so that p2 0 with no force applied, the\nchannel behavior is as shown in Fig. 2.3.20. Values for Δx are thought to lie in the range of 2 to\n4 nm, so the force required to fully open the channel is about 10-20 pN.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n1.2\nOpen probability, p2\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nNormalized force\nFig. 2.3.20. The change in probability that the channel is in the open state as normalized force,\nFΔx/(kBT) is varied. In this example, K 0 was arbitrarily set to 0.01, but the curve is relatively\neq\ninsensitive to this value provided it is small.\n2.3.7 Mechanotransduction in non-sensory cells\nWhile the need for mechanotransduction is obvious in the case of sensory cells, it is less so in the\ncase of other, non-sensory cell types. Nonetheless, we now know that nearly every type of cell\nhas the innate capability to respond to a mechanical stimulus. Many of the cells' responses\ncontribute to normal physiologic function. As one example, when a cell is exposed to higher\nlevels of stress from its environment, it typically responds by increasing its own stiffness by\nremodeling its cytoskeleton, increasing its strength of adhesion to surrounding structures, and\noften by upregulating the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. All this tends to make the\ncell better able to withstand the imposed stress and resist damage. On a larger scale, the\ncoordinated response of the cells contained in the wall of an artery, provide the means for the\nvessel to adjust to changes in the level of flow or changes in pressure. In the former case, a\nreduction in flow, for example, leading to a reduction in wall shear stress, elicits a response from\nthe resident cells - endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts - that lead to wall\nremodeling and a subsequent reduction in vessel diameter. Through this response, the arterial\nsystem maintains vascular dimensions appropriate for the distribution of blood flow. This same\nresponse, however, can contribute to pathologies as in the case of atherosclerosis. Regions of\nlow wall shear stress in bifurcations, for example, experience the same tendencies for vessel\nnarrowing, which, in combination with other biological responses, can ultimately lead to\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nlocalized constrictions and flow impairment. Thus, a healthy, desirable response contributes to\nthe disease process in the long term. Numerous other examples could be given: bone remodeling\ndue to stress, the stimulation of collagen and glycosaminoglycan synthesis by chondrocytes in\ncartilage. Many of these processes play major roles both in tissue repair or remodeling and the\nprogression of disease. For these reasons, the study of cellular responses to mechanical force has\nbecome a major effort and continues to be a focus in many research laboratories.\nPhysical factors that elicit a response\nCells are subjected to a variety of forces during the course of normal function, and these forces\nvary considerably both in magnitude and in time-course. For example, cartilage and bone\nexperience stresses in the range of several MPa during normal function, and as high as 10's of\nMPa in extreme situations. Stresses resulting from muscle contraction are in the range of 105 Pa.\nArterial blood pressure is about 104 Pa, and circumferential stresses in the arterial wall are about\nan order of magnitude higher than that. By contrast, the shear stress exerted on the vascular\nendothelium is in the range of 1-4 Pa, and the shear stress experienced by a cell settling in\nplasma under the action of gravity is down around 10-3 Pa. Clearly the range of stress in tissue is\nenormous, spanning more than 10 orders of magnitude! One needs to be careful, however, in\nrelating these figures to the stresses experienced directly by cells. In the case of bone and\ncartilage, the extracellular matrix supports the vast majority of the stress borne by the tissue. The\nsame is true in the vessels of the circulation. In addition, we need to draw a distinction between\nhydrostatic pressure (1/3 times the trace of the stress tensor) and the stresses such as shear that\ncause cellular deformation. This is a point we will return to later, but for now, it is sufficient to\nrecognize that arterial endothelial cells appear to be more sensitive to changes in shear stresses in\nthe range of 1 Pa than to changes in pressure as high at 104 Pa. The difference appears to lie in\nthe level of deformation experienced by the cell in each case.\nVarious types of mechanical stimulus have been implicated in eliciting a biological\nresponse (see Table 1). Essentially any manner in which the cell might be subjected to force or\nexperience deformation can elicit a reaction from the cell. While it is often difficult to relate one\ntype of stimulus to another, a common feature of the conditions necessary to produce a response\nis (1) a level of strain in the range of 1 to 10%, or (2) shear stresses in the range of 1-10 Pa.\nNoting that the Young's modulus of the cytoskeleton for a typical cell is in the range of 100 Pa,\nthese values for stress and strain can be seen to be roughly equivalent, i.e., a stress of 1-10 Pa\napplied to a material with a modulus of 100 Pa will produce strains of 1-10%. We might expect,\ntherefore, that cells exhibiting a higher modulus might require either higher levels of stress or\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nless strain before they respond, depending on whether the critical feature of the stimulus is stress\nor strain.\nIt has also been observed that cells respond differently to static stresses or strains than to\nthose applied in a cyclic or more generally time-dependent manner, suggesting that the temporal\nnature of the load or deformation is critical in determining the threshold, if not the nature, of the\nresponse. For example, the magnitude of the response of endothelial cells to shear stress in a\nlaminar shear flow is observed to depend upon the rate at which the shear stress is ramped up\nwith time. Also, the response of a cell to laminar (steady) or turbulent shear stress can be quite\ndifferent, even if the average value is the same for the two flows. While the basis for this\ninfluence of time varying stress has not been identified, a number of possibilities exist. Due to\nthe viscoelastic character of the cell and cell membrane, the deformations associated with a\nparticular level of strain will depend on the frequency of forcing.\nStimulus\nThreshold level for response\nFluid dynamic shear stress\n0.1-0.5 Pa\nCyclic strain\n1%\nOsmotic stress\nCompression in a 3D matrix\n1-4% strain\nTransmembrane stress\n0.5 kPa\nPerturbations via tethered microbeads\n1 nN\nTable 1. Physical stimuli known to elicit a biological response.\nMethods used to test cellular response\nA wide variety of in vitro systems have been employed to apply stress or strain to cells in a\ncontrolled manner and thereby test their biological response. These systems can be broadly\nclassified according to whether the level of strain or stress is controlled in the experiment (Table\n1). Generally it is desirable that the conditions to which the cells are subjected is uniform, since\nthe common methods for assessing biologic response involves harvesting the entire cell\npopulation and using methods such as Northern blots or Western blots to test for mRNA or\nprotein, respectively. Recently, however, new methods have been developed (e.g., in situ\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nhybridization) that provide information on the distribution of a particular response, thereby\nprecluding the need for uniform stimulus.\nThe range of conditions used in these systems is typically determined so that the levels of\nstress or stain exceed the threshold values to elicit a biological response, but fall short of those\nthat cause cell death as, for example, by rupturing the cell membrane. This essentially dictates\nthe ranges shown in Table 2. One of the objectives in their design is to produce a condition that\nmimics that experienced by cells in vivo, yet is simple enough to exert sufficient control and\nminimize the presence of extraneous, confounding factors. Hence, systems have generally\nproduced either strain or stress, though in some instances an attempt is made to replicate both.\nOne example is in the case when cells are grown on the interior surface of a compliant tube so\nthat the cells experience shear stress and strain simultaneously. Experiments such as these\nprovide a means of studying potential synergistic effects of multiple factors.\nDevice for applying\nRange and type of\nDegree of uniformity in\nReferences\nstress\nstress or strain\nstress magnitude\nparallel flow chamber\nshear, 1-100 Pa\nuniform, except near\nentrance\ncone-and-plate\nshear, 1-100 Pa\nuniform\nviscometer\nradial flow chamber\nshear, 1-100 Pa\nvaries as 1/r\nbiaxial stretch, bulging\nstrain, 1-20%\nnon-uniform\nmembrane\nbiaxial stretch, oscillating strain, 1-20%\nuniform\ncylinder\ncompliant tube\nstrain + stress\nuniform stress, except\nnear entrance, axial strain\ndifferent from circ. strain\nconfined compression in\nstrain\nuniform in direction of\n3D matrix\ncompression\nunconfined compression\nstrain\nnon-uniform\nin 3D matrix\ntethered microbeads\nforce (1-10 nN??) or\nnon-uniform, but\ndisplacement (1-5 μm)\nlocalized\nhydrostatic pressure\npressure, up to 1 atm\nuniform\ntransmembrane pressure\npressure differential,\nuniform\n(<3000 Pa)\nTable 2. Experimental systems used to investigate the biological response of cells in culture to a\nmechanical stimulus.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nTypes of response\nWhen one considers the enormous body of literature devoted to mechanotransduction, it is\ndifficult to discern the underlying threads that tie it all together. There exist many ways in which\nto characterize the complexities of the response of a cell to mechanical stimulus - here we\nconsider two perspectives: (i) in terms of the time-course of the biological response involved,\nand (ii) in terms of the fundamental cellular function targeted by the collective response (e.g.,\nhow is the response manifested with regard to the fundamental workings of the cell such as\nmigration, differentiation, division, etc.).\nThese classifications require some elaboration. For the first, we can think in terms of the\nsequence of events leading to the different types of response (see Fig. 2.3.21). As the term,\nsignaling cascade, implies, the response occurs in a sequential manner, beginning with events\nimmediately following transduction, within seconds of the mechanical stimulus, but often taking\nhours, days, or even longer to achieve the end result. For example, the sudden onset of fluid\nshear stress gives rise to an almost immediate increase in calcium ion concentration - within a\nperiod of about a minute. Some of the responses are even more rapid, as can be seen in Fig.\n2.3.21. Other responses take somewhat longer and involve a signaling pathway, but one that is\nconfined to the cytoplasm and does not involve changes in gene expression. These responses\ntypically take longer, from minutes to hours, and are often localized. Examples include the\nchanges in cytoskeletal structure that occur in the vicinity of the mechanical stimulus, as by an\nadherent bead forced by a magnetic trap. The third category includes all those responses\nmediated by changes in gene expression and altered protein synthesis. These typically take\nlonger, on the scale of hours, but also produce the greatest long-term effects. For example,\nchanges in the rates of production of extracellular matrix molecules will, over a long period, lead\nto interstitial remodeling. The entire remodeling process may take weeks or even years. Finally,\nthere may be responses that influence post-translational modification of synthesized proteins.\nThese may occur entirely in the cytoplasm, independent of any nuclear events.\nseconds\nminutes\nhours\ndays\ncytoskeletal changes\nECM remodeling\nchanges in cell\nmorphology\nK+ channel activation\nIncrease in intracellular\nCa2+\n2nd messenger cascades\ninitiated\nTransient elevation of\nIP3\nAdenylyl cyclase\nactivation\nIncreased release of NO,\nPGI2, endothelin\nchanges in gene\nexpression (both up-\nand down-regulation)\nnew protein synthesis\nstimulation of\nendocytosis\nincreased cell replication\nin a monolayer\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nFig. 2.3.21.

Examples of biological functions that are known to be influenced by mechanical\nstimulus.\nThe second way in which we can characterize the response, as mentioned above, is in\nterms of the end effect. One of the processes influenced by mechanical stimulus is cell\nmigration. But migration involves a multitude of responses that collectively lead to the observed\nchange in motility. This might include polarization of the cell, changes in the rate at which\nvarious cytoskeletal proteins are synthesized, changes in the synthesis and release of enzymes to\ndegrade the extracellular matrix; collectively this represents a change in phenotype from a\nstationary to migratory cell. Other types of collective response are listed in Table 3.\nOften the rational basis for the collective response is not immediately apparent. In the\ncase of the changes in cell alignment and morphology in response to laminar fluid dynamic shear\nstress (see Fig. 2.3.22), it took years after the initial observation before it was realized that at\nleast one consequence was to reduce the drag experienced by the cell. Cells are also observed to\nreorient in response to cyclic strain. If the strain is uni-directional, for example, the cells become\nelongated with their long axis pointing in a direction perpendicular to the axis of deformation\n(Ives, Eskin et al. 1986); this coincides with the development of actin stress fibers (bundles of\nactin filaments) similarly aligned (Sumpio, Banes et al. 1988).\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nFig. 2.3.22.

At present, we have a\nreasonably complete picture of how one stretch-activated ion channel changes its conductance in\nresponse to changes in tension in the lipid bilayer. We also know to some degree of detail how\nhair cells in the ear respond to mechanical perturbation. In most other cases, however,\nparticularly in the case of non-sensory cells, theories have been proposed, but they await\nexperimental confirmation. Here we begin with a discussion of stretch-activated channels and\nuse this as a basis for the discussion of other, less well understood, theories of\nmechanotransduction.\nStretch-activated or mechanosensitive channels. Some years ago, Nehar, Sakmann and\nSteinback (The extracellular patch clamp: a method for resolving currents through individual\nopen channels in biological membranes. Pflugers Arch. 1978 Jul 18;375(2):219-28.) developed\nan experimental technique in which a small region of the cell membrane can be isolated and its\nconductance measured. A micropipette with diameter in the range of 1 to several microns is\nbrought into contact with the cell, and the membrane is drawn into the mouth of the pipette by\nmeans of a slightly negative pressure, producing a seal between the pipette and the membrane\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nand isolated in small region of membrane to which different pressures or different solutions can\nbe applied. This procedure, referred to as a patch clamp, provides a means by which the\nconductivity of the membrane can be measured and has been widely used in ion channel\nresearch.\nUsing the patch clamp technique, it can easily be demonstrated that certain ion channels\nchange their conductivity in response to changes in the level of pressure acting across the\nmembrane. Recall from the Law of Laplace that the membrane tension σ is related to the\ntransmembrane pressure drop Δp through the relationship:\nRΔp\nσ =\n(44)\nwhere R is the radius of curvature of the membrane within the mouth of the pipette. Although\ndifferent channels have been found to respond to different levels of stress, the minimum pressure\ndifferences needed to open a channel typically fall in the range of 10 to 100 mmHg (roughly 103\n- 104 Pa) and values of membrane tension necessary to open 50% of the channels have been\nestimated to be approximately 10-2 Pa m. This value falls close to the level of tension at which a\nlipid bilayer ruptures (~ 6x10-2 Pa m; see Ch. 2.2), supporting the theory that one function of\nthese channels is to allow the free passage of ions out of the cell, preventing membrane rupture\nin the event of a sudden drop in ambient osmotic pressure.\nOne of the channels that has been extensively studied is the bacterial mechanosensitive\nchannel (MscL, for Mechano-sensitive channel of Large conductance). Extensive experimental\ndata using the patch clamp technique have shown that this channel opens at pressures above\nabout 40-60 mmHg, corresponding to a critical level of membrane tension of about 10-12\ndyn/cm = 1-1.2x10-2 Pa.m. More importantly, the crystal structure of this channel was recently\nidentified to 3.5 angstrom resolution (Chang, Spencer et al. 1998) (Fig. 2.3.23), and the effects of\nchanges in membrane tension have been numerically simulated using molecular dynamics\n(Gullingsrud, Kosztin et al. 2001). In these, each individual atom in each molecule contained in\nthe lipid bilayer and channel is simulated, and changes in molecular conformation due to stress in\nthe membrane considered. Results of these simulations show that membrane tensions in the\nrange of those found experimentally to produce an increase in conductance, also produce a\nsignificant conformational change in the protein, consistent with the conductance change.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nlipid bilayer\ncentral\npore\nFig. 2.3.23. Molecular structure of the MscL channel as shown both from the side and looking\ndown the internal pore (inset). Yellow arrows indicate membrane tension [reproduced from\n(Chang, Spencer et al. 1998)].\nMembrane surface tension may not be the only force that can control channel\nconductivity. Strong evidence suggests that the proteins that comprise other channels may\npossess direct mechanical linkages to the extracellular matrix and/or the cytoskeleton. In that\nevent, forces transmitted via these linkages to the channel might also produce a conformational\nchange. One example of this type of mechanical linkage has been postulated in hair cell\nactivation, as discussed earlier in this chapter. In this case, forces transmitted via the tip link\nconnecting one stereocilium to another (Fig. 2.3.19) are thought to produce a conformational\nchange in the channel protein, leading to a change in conductance and producing the required\nstimulus.\nForces transmitted through transmembrane proteins. Various cell surface receptors are used to\nanchor the cell to its surroundings, as was discussed in the context of cell adhesion in Chapter\n2.2. Since many of these proteins serve a structural role, they also provide a means by which\nforces can be transmitted across the lipid bilayer to the intracellular network. In many cases, the\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nact of receptor-ligand bonding is, by itself, sufficient to trigger a biochemical reaction on the\nintracellular side of the membrane and, potentially, to set off a signaling cascade. It has\ntherefore been reasoned that forces transmitted via these same receptors might also produce\nconformational changes in them, or in the proteins that form the structural link between\nextracellular and intracellular elements, and lead to a similar sequence of events (Fig. 2.3.25).\nThe integrin family has often been implicated in such a role because of its importance in\ncell adhesion and since integrins are well known to act as signaling molecules. Integrins\nrepresent some of the primary receptors of extracellular matrix molecules and are known to play\na role in cell migration, cytoskeletal rearrangement and a variety of signaling pathways, some of\nwhich can also be initiated by mechanical stimulus.\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nFig. 2.3.24.

Conformational changes in a protein linking a transmembrane receptor to the\ncytoskeletal network, leading to a reaction on the intracellular side of the membrane. Top:\nShear forces due to flow over the cell layer are transmitted via protein linkages to the\ncytoskeleton. Bottom: Forces originating from the extracellular matrix are transmitted to the\ncytoskeleton, leading to conformation changes in the linker proteins.\nIn order to respond in such a way as to initiate a biochemical reaction, the forces applied\nIn order to respond in such a way as to initiate a biochemical reaction the forces applied\nto a single integrin receptor must be sufficient to produce a conformational change in the\nintracellular domain of the protein. While we know little about the level of force necessary to\naccomplish this, it is possible to establish some rough estimates. Studies using atomic force\nmicroscopy have shown that a single receptor-ligand bond detaches when a force of between 30\nand 100 pN is applied from the extracellular side (Lehenkari and Horton 1999). If an integrin\nmolecule is to act as a force transducer, then it must respond to forces no greater than this.\nProteins typically form into multiple globular regions or domains that can be connected\nby relatively flexible sections that permit twist or a hinge-like motion. Binding sites are often\nlocated in the cleft of these hinged regions and thus, the degree to which the hinge swings \"open\"\ndetermines the binding affinity for the appropriate ligand. Movements about this \"hinge\" occur\nas a result of forces as small as 0.1 to 1 pN (Bao, G., Mechanics of Biomolecules), and therefore\ncan even be influenced by Brownian effects. With the application of higher forces, in the range\nof 1 to 100 pN, the domains themselves begin to undergo deformation. For example,\nexperiments in which single molecules (e.g., titin and tenascin) are isolated and stretched using a\nlaser trap indicate that forces in the range of 100 pN can be sufficient to unfold individual\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\ndomains (Tskhovrebova, Trinick et al. 1997; Oberhauser, Marszalek et al. 1998). While all this\nis strongly suggestive, there is not yet any direct evidence demonstrating the role of force-\ninduced conformational changes in integrins, or any other intracellular protein, in the\ntransduction of a mechanical to biochemical signal.\nSignaling\ncascade\nmechano\nsensitive ion\nchannel\nconformational\nchanges in\nstructural proteins\napplied external\nforce\naltered\ngene\nexpressionn\nΔ in protein\nsynthesis or post\ntranslational\nmodifications\nFig. 2.3.26. Summary of the ways in which a cell responds to external forcing. The applied\nforce is transduced into a biochemical signal, here shown either by activation of a stretch\nactivated (mechano-sensitive) ion channel or by conformational changes in intracellular proteins.\nThis triggers a signaling cascade that can results in changes in gene expression, changes in\ncytoplasmic processes, or changes in post-translational modifications of protein. Altered gene\nexpression changes the profile of proteins synthesized by the cell.\nMechanotransduction at sites remote from the point of forcing. Forces acting external to a cell\nare subsequently distributed throughout the cell interior via the cytoskeletal network, leading to\nthe possibility that the site of transduction may be quite remote from the point of stimulus.\nAlthough the levels of stress will generally fall with increasing distance from the site of origin,\nseveral factors might cause forces to become concentrated at particular remote locations. For\nexample, when the forcing itself is diffuse, the locations of maximum force are more likely to\ndepend on how the cell adheres to its surroundings, and how concentrated or diffuse the adhesion\nsites are. In focal adhesion complexes, especially common in cells grown in two-dimensional\nculture and mechanically stimulated, the forces exerted by fluid dynamic shear tend to be\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nfocused, and the forces acting within network structures in the immediate vicinity of the focal\nadhesion may be among the highest found in the cell.\nThe impact of this can easily be seen through the following example. Consider an\nisolated endothelial cell with a surface area of 1000 μm2 exposed to steady shear stress of 1 Pa\n(10 dyn/cm2), which adheres to the substrate via 50 focal adhesion sites, the average area of each\nbeing 4 μm2. In order to maintain a force balance, the stress must be amplified 5-fold, to an\naverage of 5 Pa at each adhesion site. Moreover, because the shear stress produces a torque on\nthe cell, forces will no be uniformly distributed; adhesion sites near the upstream end of the cell\nwill need to support a larger force, on average, than those on the downstream end, provided the\ndensity of adhesion sites is uniform.\nFocusing can also occur at points of cross-linking between cytoskeletal filaments, where\nlarge forces or torques might additionally act on individual proteins (Fig. 2.3.27). Stress-related\nchanges in the binding of cytoskeletal proteins have been demonstrated in cells stripped of their\nlipid bilayer and subjected to strain on an elastic substrate (Sawada and Sheetz 2002), suggesting\nthat deformations of about 10% can lead to selective binding. It is becoming increasingly clear\nthat external forces can alter reaction kinetics within the cell, and that these are likely mediated\nby conformational changes in individual proteins.\nFig. 2.3.27. Mechanotransduction mediated by proteins that bind to, and possibly\ncross-link the individual filaments of the cytoskeleton. Stresses applied to the\nnetwork expose a binding site in the linking protein, allowing a chemical reaction\nto take place.\nChanges in the mobility and aggregation of membrane proteins. Other processes have also been\nshown to be related to mechanotransduction events. One of these is a reduction in membrane\nviscosity as a result of the application of fluid dynamic shear stress (Haidekker, L'Heureux et al.\n2000). While the events that cause the reduction in membrane viscosity have not yet been\nelucidated, such a reduction would lead to freer mobility of transmembrane proteins and an\nincreased likelihood of receptor aggregation, thereby affecting their rates of reaction.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n3.3.7 Nomenclature:\nx\n=\nlocation of actin binding site relative to location of zero force on myosin head\nv\n=\nvelocity of actin filament relative to myosin filament\nn(x)\n=\nprobability of actin-myosin attachment between x and x+dx\nk+(x)\n=\nrate constant for actin-myosin attachment\nk-(x)\n=\nrate constant for actin-myosin release\nk+\n=\nconstant value for k+(x) in the range x < 0\nk-\n=\nconstant value for k-(x) in the range h-x0 < x < h\nh\n=\ndistance between site of attachment and zero force point\nx0\n=\ndistance over which binding occurs (h >> x0)\nρs\n=\nnumber of sarcomeres / unit volume\nκ\n=\nspring constant for crossbridge\ns\n=\nsarcomere length\nl\n=\ndistance between cross bridges on a sarcomere\nF\n=\ntotal developed force in a muscle\nA\n=\ncross-sectional area of muscle\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n3.3.8 Problems\n1 -- Gravitationally-driven cell\nConsider a highly viscous, non-wetting droplet that slowly slides down an inclined plane under\nthe action of gravity.

To measure this force cells are grown on an incompressible gel that has a sufficiently\nlow elastic modulus such that it deforms by a measurable amount in response to the forces\ngenerated by the cells and transmitted to the gel. In order to monitor these deformations,\nfluorescent microparticles are embedded in the gel and the change in separation distance between\nparticles as a result of the contraction is measured. You may model the cell as a disk-shaped\nobject with diameter D and assume that it remains firmly attached to the gel. (Note that\nmyocytes are normally elongated, but are modeled here as disk-shaped for simplicity.)\na) Given that the two particles in the sketch immediately beneath the cell are separated by a\ndistance L (~D) prior to cell contraction, and L-δ just afterward, and that the Young's\nmodulus of the gel is Eg, obtain an estimate for the contractile force generated by the cell, F.\nb) Describe what you would expect to find if you monitored two microparticles located in\nthe gel as shown in the sketch below, but positioned perpendicular to the direction of cell\ncontraction, but in a plane parallel to the gel surface.

A bleb is formed when fluid pressure reaches a level that\nit can separate the membrane from its tethers to the cortical cytoskeleton. In the supplemental\nmaterial associated with that paper, a scaling analysis is proposed to predict the separation of the\nmembrane from the cortical cytoskeleton, leading to the prediction that the critical bleb size is:\nT J )1/ 2\ndc ~ ( 0\nP\nwhere J is the energy per unit area of adhesion, P is fluid pressure and T0 is the membrane\ntension.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\na) Show how one can obtain the approximate form of the equation used in the analysis for the\n\"free energy of detachment\".\nb) Explain in you own words how the size of the region of membrane separation is determined.\nc) Does this approach seem reasonable to you? Why or why not?\nThe relevant section of text from the Supplement is copied below:\n\"Starting with this picture for stress generation, the critical area of membrane detachment from\nthe cytoskeleton needed for a bleb to start growing can be estimated. The free energy for the\ndetachment of a small area of membrane of diameter d from the cortex, is U ≈ Pd2δ - Jd 2 - Tδ 2\nwhere P is the given hydrostatic pressure, δ the membrane deflection, J the membrane-\ncytoskeleton adhesion energy, and T the membrane tension. For small deflections, the membrane\nunwrinkles as it detaches, and can flow in the plane to accommodate blebbing. Therefore, the\nmembrane tension is relatively uniform as the bleb starts forming, henceT ≈ T0 ≈ constant . In\n∂U\n∂U\nT0J\nthis limit, solving\n=\n= 0 yields the critical bleb size dc ~ (\n)1/ 2 above which a bleb will\nP 2\n∂d\n∂δ\ngrow catastrophically in a pressure controlled situation; however, the limited volume of fluid\navailable prevents this. Equating this critical size to the average distance between cytoskeletal\nmembrane anchors yields the minimum pressure for bleb growth. With J~10-4 J.m-2 10 , T0~10-2\nmN.m-1 11, and P~300 Pa (Figure S1), we get a nucleation size dc~100nm.\nFinally, during retraction, myosin heads moving along actin filaments bring the bleb back\ntowards the cell body forcing the cytosol back in. Assuming a constant pressure within the bleb\nbecause it only consists of cytosol, Darcy's law implies that the cortex must exert a pressure\nvd\nΔP ≈\nwith v the retraction speed , d the stress diffusion length, and k the hydraulic\nk\npermeability of the cytoskeleton.

This is a realistic number in view of the estimated number of\nmyosins within a cell Ntotal>104 15.\"\n9 -- Nematode motility\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nNematodes have been observed to migrate by pseudopod protrusion and cell contraction, in a\nmanner that appears quite similar to actin-based motility of other cell types. What distinguishes\nnematode migration, however, is that these cells lack actin, and use another filament-forming\nprotein, major sperm protein (MSP). MSP differs from actin in several important respects:\n- MSP filaments lack polarity, so cell contraction must not result from motor-induced\ncontractility of motors that \"walk\" in a preferred direction along the filament.\n- Unlike actin, MSP filaments form bundles without the aid of cross-linking proteins.\n- Networks of MSP are thought to adhere to the intracellular face of the cell membrane in a\npH-sensitive manner, so that a call can modulate the strength of adhesion between the\nnetwork and the membrane by adjusting local intracellular pH.\nA recent paper describes nematode motility in the following way:\nIn summary, near the cell center, the crosslinking sites protonate, the hydrophobic bundling force weakens\nand the filament bundles begin to dissociate into their constituent filaments. Each filament that peels off a\nfilament bundle can now shorten to its equilibrium length, L0; this generates a nearly isotropic contractile\nstress. Because the substrate adhesive forces are less at the rear of the cell than at the front, this contractile\nstress pulls the cell body forwards, rather than pulling the cell front rearwards. Thus, bundling of filaments\nat the cell front and their subsequent unbundling at the cell rear constitutes a 'push-pull' motor that drives\nthe cell forwards. Said another way, bundling creates both the protrusive force at the leading edge and the\nstorage of elastic energy in the lamellipodial gel that is later released to generate the retraction force\nrequired to pull up the cell rear. (Bottino, et al., J Cell Sci, 2002)\nIn addition to the forward-acting force resulting from filament bundling, the familiar Brownian\nratchet generates force at the leading edge of the protrusion. Together with an asymmetry in\nadhesion, associated with variations in pH, the nematode produces all the essential elements of\nmigration: protrusion, adhesion, contraction, and rear release.\na) MSP forms filaments that, like actin, consist of monomers arranged in a double helical pattern.\nThe individual MSP monomers are much smaller than actin, however, having a molecular weight\nof only 14kDa. Due to their smaller molecular weight, the filaments will be smaller in diameter.\nGiven that the molecular weight of actin is 43 kDa, and its diameter is 4 nm, what would you\nestimate to be the diameter of an MSP monomer?\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nAssuming that the effective Young's modulus of an MSP filament is the same as that of\nan actin filament (E ~ 2x109 Pa) and an actin filament has a persistence length of about 15 μm,\nwhat will be the persistence length of a single MSDP filament?\nb) Now consider the mechanism of network contraction. Consistent with the quote provided\nabove, filaments near the cell center become protonated due to the locally lower pH, and this\ncauses the filament bundles to start to unravel, with individual filaments becoming separated\nfrom the bundles. When bundled, the proteins tend to assume a length in the fiber approximately\nequal to their contour length, and enthalpic effects dominate fiber elasticity. As individual\nfilaments separate from the bundle due to protonation, they tend to want to shorten due to\nentropic effects that cause them to assume a more random configuration. Consider just a single\nbundle, consisting of a collection of N filaments and assume that as they bundle, they become\nclose-packed and adhere tightly to each other with no relative slippage when the bundle bends.\nBecause they are bundled, each filament within the bundle is initially at a length nearly (but not\nquite!) equal to its contour length, L. As the individual filaments separate, one-by-one, a new\nequilibrium is reached in which those filaments that have separated from the bundle are in\ntension, stretched beyond their rest length, and those filaments remaining in the bundle are in\ncompression.\nFirst, obtain an expression for the difference between the rest length of a single filament\nand its contour length, assuming that the filament, because of its large persistence length,\nremains nearly straight.\nNow consider all filaments in a bundle to be in parallel and tethered to fixed points at the\ntwo ends, and that there is no net force exerted at the ends of each bundle. Obtain an expression\nfor the difference between the rest length of the bundle and its contour length, given the\nassumptions stated above. (Hint: Note that the individual filaments are nearly straight, due to\ntheir long persistence length, whether or not they are bundled.)\nc) As a bundle starts to unravel, some of the filaments will be acting as though they are free\nwhile others will continue to act as part of a bundle. All filaments continue to be tethered at the\nsame two endpoints. Explain the state of tension or compression in the two groups of filaments\n(free or bundled), and the net effect this has on the distance between the two endpoints, which\nyou can assume are still under zero net force.\nExplain how you would compute the new rest length of this collection of filaments, some\nof which are free and some of which remain part of the bundle.\nd) Consider now, the forces exerted by the tips of the filaments on the cell membrane, and the\nresponse of the membrane in two limiting cases, when either tension or bending stiffness\ndominate. In both cases, you may assume that the filaments exert an average normal force f per\nfilament, that the force is uniformly distributed over the entire surface of the membrane at the\nleading edge of the protrusion (and is everywhere normal to it), and the number of filaments per\nunit area of membrane is ρf [# filaments/m2].\nCase (i) (membrane tension dominates so that the bending stiffness can be ignored)\nCalculate the tension in the membrane. You may assume the surface tension, N, is equal in all\ndirections, and that the local radii of curvature of the membrane are R1 and R2 (in two mutually\nperpendicular planes), with R1 << R2.\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nCase (ii): (membrane bending dominates so that tension can be ignored). Calculate the\nbending stiffness of the membrane Kb, assuming that the bending occurs in just a single plane.\nThe geometry of the membrane is characterized by the two characteristic lengths, L and δ, as\ndefined in the sketch.\nWhat condition must be satisfied for bending stiffness to dominate over tension?\nL\nδ\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\nCell migration model\nConsider the following simple model for cell migration. A \"cell\" contains a Newtonian fluid of\nviscosity μ and adheres to the substrate beneath it with an adhesion force per unit area fa.\nDepending on the strength of adhesion (e.g., the density of bonds or the adhesive force per bond)\nthe cell takes on different configurations at the two limits of adhesive strength as shown in the\nfigure. In the limit of small fa, the cell rounds up so that the contact made with the substrate is\nconfined to an area of diameter d which is small compared to the dimension of the entire cell. In\nthe limit of large fa, the cell flattens into a \"pancake\" shape with contact diameter d which is\nlarge compared to the height of the cell, h.\nTo analyze the cell's motion, we assume a balance between the power generated by the actin\nmyosin motors that lead to an internal force F (that must be in balance with the external adhesive\nforces, fa d2) and the rate of viscous dissipation inside the cell. Note that the dissipation external\nto the cell can be neglected both due to the low velocities there and the low viscosity relative to\nthe cell cytoplasm. As the cell migrates, the internal dissipation which is confined to a region\nthat scales as d3 in the rounded cell, but d2h in the flattened cell.\na)\nObtain scaling relationships for the two limits described above that describes the\ndependence of the velocity of the migrating cell v as a function of the parameters, μ, fa, d,\nand V where V is the cell volume. Compare your scaling predictions to the experimental\ndata presented in class.\nb)\nHow might this simple model be improved upon?\nh\nd\nd\nv\nv\n\nCHAPTER 2.3: ACTIVE CELL PROCESSES\n(c)RD Kamm 4/6/15\n3.3.9 Bibliography\nAlberts, B., A.
