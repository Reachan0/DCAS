It is designed to give students extensive experience in Portuguese and emphasizes skill development and refinement in the area of critical reading and writing in Portuguese.\n\nWe will review the finer aspects of grammar along with activities that target vocabulary enrichment and further oral and written proficiency, while analyzing newspaper and magazine articles, literary texts, films and music. We also use a range of resources and materials from the Internet to initiate different oral activities. Writing is practiced through frequent essays and short compositions. Each assigned reading, web research, or movie seen will be followed by class discussion.\n\nClass will be conducted entirely in Portuguese.\n\nRequired Textbook\n\nLima, Emma, and Samira Lunes.\nPortugues Via Brasil: Um Curso Avancado Para Estrangeiros\n.

Communication and practice are essential. Therefore, working with others is highly encouraged. However, there are cases in which collaboration is tantamount to cheating. There follow some examples of what is allowed and what is not in our class: having your pronunciation corrected by a native speaker before an oral presentation is perfectly acceptable. They won't utter the words for you in class. Using a spellchecker is valid if you are writing a text, but having a text edited by another person before submission is clearly a different matter. To a certain extent, the editor is the coauthor of the text. Likewise, the use of dictionaries is recommended, but no translation program may be used. In a few words, obtaining help from people or online resources is allowed as a way of enhancing your learning, but should be avoided altogether if as a result of it, the work submitted is not an accurate representation of the student's progress or capacity. If that's the case, it will be considered academic dishonesty.",
