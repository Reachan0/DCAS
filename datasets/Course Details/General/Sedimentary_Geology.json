SIZE\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\n1.1.1 If all sedimentary particles had the shape of regular geometrical solids,\nlike a sphere or a triaxial ellipsoid or a square, both the concept and the\nmeasurement of grain size would be straightforward. But sedimentary particles\nare almost always irregularly shaped.\n1.1.2 Some sand grains are almost perfect spheres, and many well rounded\npebbles can be approximated well by triaxial ellipsoids, which are described by\nthe lengths of the longest (a), shortest (c), and intermediate (b) major axes (Figure\n1-1). But most sediment particles are so irregular that at best they can be\nrepresented only approximately in this way. The problem is worst with very fine\nparticles. We thus run immediately into the difficulty of what we mean by the size\nof a representative sedimentary particle. A well rounded pebble by an ellipsoid.\n1.1.3 In theory, a good way out of this problem is to characterize the size of\nthe particle by its nominal diameter, the size of the sphere with volume equal to\nthat of the given particle. This is a nice concept, but it's hard to put into practice.\n(How would you measure the nominal diameter of a given sedimentary particle?)\n1.1.4 So there's no single unique dimension we can measure readily that\nwould suffice to characterize the size of the particle. We get around this in two\nways, principally:\n\n1 A well rounded pebble by an ellipsoid.\n\n- Let our choice of characteristic dimension be operationally defined.\nThat is, how we measure size defines what we mean by size. The standard way of\nmeasuring size in the coarser-grained rocks (coarser siltstones and upwards, above\nseveral tens of microns) is by sieving. How does a sieve discriminate by size? It\nmore or less chooses the largest dimension in the least cross-sectional area. This\nmight not seem like a very satisfactory measure of size, but remember that most\nsediment grains coarser than clay size are equigranular, and so exactly how we\ndiscriminate is not too important as long as it is standardized.\n- Relate size to some other more easily measurable property. The\nstandard way of measuring fine-grained material is by settling. (The size of sand-\nsize material is often measured this way, too, in devices called settling tubes.) For\nsmall spheres there's an exact solution for settling rate. The difficulties of\nnonsphericity are even greater for clay-size sediment particles than for sand, but\nbecause there's no other way, we assume that they are spheres for the sake of\ndefiniteness.\n\n1.1.5 All you need to know about fluid dynamics in order to use it for size\nmeasurement is this:\n\nfor a particle of a given shape exposed to a steady and\nuniform flow of fluid around it, the drag force exerted\nby the fluid depends on the velocity of flow, the size of\nthe sphere, and the fluid properties density and\nviscosity.\n\n1.1.6 When you release a particle in a body of still water, the particle\naccelerates in response to the downward force of its weight, and the drag force\nbuilds up until it balances the weight; then the particle settles at its terminal\nsettling velocity (Figure 1-2).\n\nB\na\nl\na\nn\nc\ne\n\nb\netween\ndow\nnward\nforce\nand\nupwa\nrd f\norce.\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 1-2: Balance between downward force of gravity and upward force of fluid drag\non a sediment particle falling at its terminal fall velocity\n\n1.1.7 For a given fluid, like water, this means that there is a function that\nrelates size to velocity. Once the function is known, all you have to do is measure\nthe settling velocity, go to a curve or table, and find the size. There are exact\nsolutions for this function only for small particles with a few regular shapes, like\nspheres or triaxial ellipsoids, but all you really need to know is the empirical\nfunction. Figure 1-3 shows a cartoon of this function; it's only qualitatively\ncorrect. For a real version, see the next chapter.\n\n1.1.8 The trouble with this approach is that particle shape varies all over the\nplace. One way around this is to develop empirical functions for a wide range of\nshapes, but this isn't very workable because there are so many shapes. What's\nusually done is to work with the fall diameter or sedimentation diameter: the\ndiameter of a quartz sphere with the same settling velocity as the given particle, in\na standard fluid (water) at a standard temperature (20° C).\n1.1.9 So when it comes to measuring size, we have to live with an imperfect\nworld. What's done in actual practice for the various size ranges is as follows:\n\ngravel: usually sieving, or for special studies, direct measurement with\ncalipers; the coarsest sizes usually aren't even measured.\nsand: sieving is the standard method, but various kinds of settling tubes are\nalso in common use.\nmud: down to about 40-50 μm, sieving (wet sieving is better in the fine\nsizes), and for all mud sizes, settling techniques.\n\n1.1.10 These techniques work only for unconsolidated sediment. What do\nwe do to measure grain size in rocks? Typically, cut a thin section, measure sizes\nwith a micrometer ocular, and then make a point count at the same time to get the\ndistribution. The obvious difficulty with this is that the sectioning usually doesn't\ncut through the center of the particle. There have been studies, both theoretical\n\nSettling velocity\nagainst sphere size.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 1-3: Cartoon version of\n\ngraph of terminal fall velocity against sphere size\n\nand empirical, aimed at getting around that problem If the rock is not too\nindurated, gentle disaggregation and then sieving is often possible.\n\n1.2 Grade Scales\n\n1.2.1 It's natural to split up the continuum of sizes into conventional\ndivisions, to facilitate both communication and thought. Such a split is called a\ngrade scale. Several grade scales are in use, depending upon field of study and\nwhere you're working. English-speaking sedimentologists use the Udden-\nWentworth grade scale, built around powers of two. It's a geometric or\nlogarithmic rather than an arithmetic scale. (This is desirable for largely obvious\nby partly inexplicable reasons.)\n1.2.2 It's easiest to work directly with a linear or arithmetic measure of the\nlog scale rather than the logs of the actual sizes. For this reason, the famous\n(infamous?) phi scale was introduced:\n\nφ = - log2 (diameter in mm)\n\n(1.1)\n\nFigure 1-4 gives a conversion table from millimeters to phi units.\n\nC\no\nn\nv\ne\nr\nsion table.\n\n1.3 Statistical Analysis of Particle Size\n\n1.3.1 Statistics is an important part of sedimentology. A great many\nvariables sedimentologists measure and deal with are random variables, in that\nwhy they take a given value seems to be random, even though there may be\nunderlying laws we can't sort out. You have to deal with these variables\nstatistically. Sediment size is only one example of such a random variable. What\nfollows is a brief account of the statistics of random variables applied to\nsedimentology.\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n.\nFigure 1-4: A conversion table between millimeters and phi units\n\n1.3.2 For a given sediment, why do we see the percentages we see in each of\nthe class intervals or fractions? Usually we can't answer that, but we can at least\ndevelop a rational way of describing what we have.\n1.3.3 The raw data, obtained from size measurement by sieving or settling\nanalysis, is usually in the form of weight percent of total sample in each of the\nvarious size classes defined by the grade scale. These percentages add up to\n100%. (If they don't quite add up to 100% when you make the measurements,\njust distribute the small error among all the fractions to make the total come out to\n100%.)\n1.3.4 Probably the most important size characteristic of a sediment is the\n\"average\" size. A natural way of expressing this is the mean size. (But there are\nother ways; see below.) The mean of a number of values is defined as\n\nM = Σx\nN\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere x is a value and N is the number of values. The mean of grouped data (the\nkind we get in sediment size analysis, by either sieving or settling) is\n\nM = Σ(fx')\nN\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere f is frequency in a class, x' is class midpoint, and N is number of values.\n1.3.5 The most meaningful mean in our case is the logarithmic mean. You\nget it by:\n\nusing the phi values of the midpoints of the class intervals,\nmultiplying these phi values by the frequencies in the size classes,\nsumming over all the values, and\ndividing by the number of values.\n\nThen you can get the mean size by converting from phi to mm.\n1.3.6 One problem with the mean is that the tails of the size distribution,\nwhich are hard to measure accurately (fine stuff gets lost; big stuff is too \"lumpy\"\nstatistically) have a strong effect on the computation.\n1.3.7 You also need a measure of how clustered or spread out the\ndistribution is around the mean. This idea is expressed by the word dispersion.\nDispersion expresses the sorting of the sediment: a sediment whose sizes tend to\nfall near the mean is said to be well sorted (or, in engineering terminology, poorly\ngraded; engineering usage is opposite to sedimentological usage!), and a sediment\nwhose sizes range widely around the mean is said to be poorly sorted.\n1.3.8 Here's the best way to find the true standard deviation σ:\n\nσ =\nx -x\n(\n)\n∑\nN\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere x is the mean, or, for grouped data,\n\nσ =\n′\nx -x\n(\n)\n∑\nN\n\n(1.5)\n\n1.3.9 The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, the sum of\nthe squares of deviations of frequencies in each class interval from the mean,\ndivided by the number of values. Again this is most easily done using the phi\nscale. We have the same problem here as with the mean: the tails of the\ndistribution are important.\n1.3.10 In theory we could also compute the so-called higher moments of the\ndistribution. (The mean and variance are the first two moments of the\ndistribution.) Although I don't expect you to make use of it, here's the expression\nfor pth moment of the distribution:\n\nmp =\nx -x\n(\n)\np\n∑\nN\n\n(1.6)\n1.3.11 What do these higher moments mean? It turns out that an expression\ninvolving the second and third moments describes the degree of asymmetry of the\ndistribution (skewness), and an expression involving the second and fourth\nmoments describes the ratio between the spread in the middle part of the\ndistribution and the spread in the tails (kurtosis). Figure 1-5 shows them, just for\nyour reference.\n\n6Skewness and kurtosis in frequency distributions.\nFigure 1-5: Terms to describe skewness and kurtosis in frequency distributions\nSkewness and\nkurtosis in frequen\ncy distribution\ns.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nreproducible results, standardized and calibrated sieves at narrow size intervals\nhave to be used.\n\n1.4 Graphing Size Distributions\n\n1.4.1 How do you express graphically the data of size analysis? The\nsimplest way, but not the most meaningful, is to plot a histogram, a vertical bar\ngraph of weight of sediment sample by size classes (Figure 1-6). Obviously, the\nheights of the bars depends on the size of the sample you use.\nWe\ni\ng\nh\nt\n\no\nf\n\nsample against p\narticle size\n.\n1.4.2 Or, you could normalize the histogram by plotting percent of total\nweight vs. size class interval (Figure 1-7). Then, no matter how large or small the\nclass interval, the total area under the histogram bars is unity (100%).\n\nW\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\n\np\nercent of sample a\ngainst particle si\nze.\n1.4.3 But still the height of the bars varies with the fineness of division of\nthe size scale. Better yet: make the vertical axis be weight percent divided by size\ninterval. Then the overall course of the tops of the bars is the same regardless of\nthe fineness of subdivision (Figure 1-8).\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 1-6: Histogram of weight of sample against particle size\nFigure 1-7: Histogram of weight percent of sample against particle size\n1.3.12 Skewness seems to be sedimentologically significant, but the\nsignificance of kurtosis is unclear. With these higher-moment measures, errors in\nsampling and measurement get highly magnified. For meaningful and\n\nN\no\nr\nm\na\nl\nized wei\nght percent o\nf sample\nagainst part\nicle siz\ne.\n\n1.4.4 As you progressively decrease the size class interval, the bars get\nthinner, but the overall shape and size of the histogram stays the same. This is\nbest visualized in a vertical line graph, with data plotted as vertical lines from the\nmidpoints of the class intervals (Figure 1-9). This kind of graph also lends itself\nbetter to thinking about a limiting process.\nV\ne\nr\nt\ni\nc\na\nl line g\nraph of weigh\nt of sample against particle size.\n1.4.5 This suggests the possibility of performing a limiting process to\nobtain a smooth curve from the histogram: as the number of class intervals\nincreases without limit, does the stepped curve connecting the tops of the vertical\nlines tend toward a smooth curve? In principle, NO, because there are only a\nfinite number of sand grains in a sample, and \"most\" sizes are missing. Past a\ncertain point in the fineness of subdivision the histogram blows up and does funny\nthings.\n1.4.6 But this is being overly pedantic; you don't need to worry about this\noperationally unless you have only a very small number of grains to work with.\nYou have to assume that your dependent variable, weight of sample in a given size\nclass, which is quasi-continuous on a large scale but definitely discrete on a small\nscale, is actually a continuous variable. If you performed the limiting process for a\nsmoothly continuous variable, you would get a limiting continuous curve toward\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 1-8: Nor\n\nmalized histogram of weight percent of sample per unit size interval\nagainst particle size\nFigure 1-9: Vertical line graph of weight percent of sample per unit size interval against\nparticle size (as in Figure 1-\n\n8) for better conceptualization of the limiting process that\nleads to a smooth frequency distribution function\n\nwhich the successively finer histograms would tend. This is called the frequency\ndistribution curve or frequency distribution function (Figure 1-10).\nF\nr\ne\nq\nu\ne\nn\nc\ny distri\nbuti\non funct\nion.\n1.4.7 The physical meaning of the vertical coordinate is seen most clearly by\nconsidering two different sizes and saying that the percent of the total sample\nbetween these two sizes is gotten by integrating the frequency distribution\nfunction between the size limits chosen (i.e., find the area under the frequency\ncurve between these two sizes).\n\n⌡⌠\ns1\ns2\nf(η)dη = weight % of sediment\n\nbetween the two sizes s1 and s2\n\n(1.7)\n\n1.4.8 There's no easy way to find the frequency distribution directly. It\nmight occur to you to plot the histogram and then fit a smooth curve through the\ntops of the histogram bars. But that provides only a crude estimate of the\nfrequency distribution, unless you make the number of class intervals unworkably\nlarge. The way sedimentologists get around this problem is to work with a\ndifferent kind of distribution, called the cumulative distribution.\n1.4.9 Both the concept and the practice of the cumulative distribution are\nfairly simple. Suppose that you have sieved a sample of sand and have weight\npercents for each size class. You can easily accumulate your data by computing a\nrunning cumulative total that gives you weight percent finer than (it could also be\nweight percent coarser than) for each size class boundary. Then plot a graph with\nweight percent finer than (arithmetically) on the vertical axis and size\n(logarithmically, or, what's the same, arithmetically in phi units) on the horizontal\naxis. You get a curve that starts at zero at the finest size in your sample and\nincreases (monotonically!) to one hundred percent at the coarsest size in your\nsample (Figure 1-11). The curve is usually at least crudely S-shaped, as in the\nfigure.\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 1-10: Frequency distri\n\nbution function for sediment size, expressed as weight\npercent per unit size interval against sediment size\n\nC\nu\nm\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\nve\ndi\ns\ntributio\nn function.\n\n1.4.10 The nice thing about the cumulative curve is that it's easy to find just\nby plotting the cumulative data points and fitting a smooth curve. By sieving your\nsame sample using several different stacks of sieves, with different size class\nboundaries, you could demonstrate to yourself that the curve you get is almost\ninsensitive to the particular choice of size intervals.\n\n1.4.11 Following up on Equation 1.7, the cumulative distribution function\ncan be written as the following definite integral:\n\nF(s) = ⌡⌠\nso\ns\nf(η ) dη\n\n(1.8)\n\nThe frequency curve and the cumulative curve are thus related as derivative and\nintegral. Figure 1-12 shows the correspondence between the frequency curve and\nthe cumulative curve. Both are useful and common in size analysis, as in many\nother applications of statistics.\n\nFrequenc\ny di\nst\nr\nibution\ncurve for particle size.\nFigure 1-11: Cumulative distribution function showing weight percent of sample against\nparticle size\n\nFigure 1-12: The frequency distribution curve for particle size, labeled to aid in\nunderstanding the correspondence between the\n\nfrequency distribution and the cumulative\n\ndistribution\n\n1.4.11 The frequency curve is not as easy to obtain as the cumulative curve.\nYou have to resort to things like graphical differentiation, or approximation of the\ncumulative curve by an analytical function (polynomial, power series, Fourier\nseries, etc.) and then differentiation at various points. This used to be tedious\nbefore the advent of computers, but now it's easy. Various standard programs\nhave been developed. This isn't something we'll pursue here.\n\n1.5 More on the \"Average\"\n\n1.5.1 In light of the frequency curve and cumulative curve, here's more\ndetail the average (or the so-called \"central tendency\", in the parlance of statistics)\nof a size distribution. I've already defined the mean, but in addition to the mean,\ntwo other measures of the average properties of the distribution can easily be\nobtained from the cumulative and frequency curves.\n\nMean: On the frequency curve, the mean size is that for which the center of\ngravity of the area under the curve lies. On the cumulative curve, it's the point at\nwhich there are equal areas, above and below, out to the limits of the distribution.\nMedian: The size that cuts the distribution in half, 50% finer, 50% coarser. On\nthe frequency curve, it's the point at which there are equal areas on each side; on\nthe cumulative curve, it's the point at which the curve crosses the 50% figure.\nMode: The most abundant size in the distribution. On the frequency curve, this is\nthe highest point. On the cumulative curve, it's the point at which the curve has\nthe steepest slope.\n\n1.5.2 It's hard to say which measure is the most significant. The median is\nthe easiest to find but probably the least valuable.\n\n1.6 Analytical Distributions\n\n1.6.1 To what extent are actual size distributions approximated by analytical\ndistributions? It is commonly assumed that sediment size distributions tend to be\nnormally (Gaussian) distributed. Figure 1-13 shows the familiar bell curve of the\nnormal distribution. And here's the equation for the normal distribution:\n\ny = f x( ) =\n2πσ\nexp -1\nx -μ\nσ\n⎛\n⎝ ⎜\n⎞\n⎠ ⎟\n⎡\n⎣\n⎢\n⎤\n⎦\n⎥\n\n(1.9)\n\nwhere μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation; they're called the parameters\nof the distribution.\n\n1.6.2 Properties of the normal distribution:\n\n- Symmetrical about the mean;\n- Distribution extends to +inf and -inf, → 0 asymptotically;\n- 68% of distribution lies between ± one standard deviation of the mean; this\nis at 16th and 84th percentiles. The inflection points in the frequency distribution\nare at these points.\n\n1.6.3 A great many sedimentological variables tend to be normally\ndistributed. (Or, more precisely, lognormally.) There's usually no evident reason\nwhy, and it's rarely exactly so. It seems to turn out that many if not most natural\nsands have a long straight-line segment on a graph like this, with tails that curve\naway.\n1.6.4 Size distributions are commonly plotted on graph paper (called\nprobability paper) with the frequency axis rubber-sheeted so that a normal\ndistribution plots as a straight line (Figure 1-14). This has become a reference\nstandard.\n\n1.6.5 Some sediments have two peaks on the size-frequency curve; these are\ncalled bimodal distributions, in contrast to the more common unimodal\ndistributions (Figure 1-15). They are fairly common. Usually one of the maxima\n\nNormal frequency distribution.\nNormal frequency distribution on probability graph paper.\nFigure 1-13: The Gaussian or normal frequency distribution\nFigure 1-14: A normal frequency distribution plots as a straight line on probability graph\n\npaper\nNormal frequency di\nst\nri\nb\nu\nt\ni\non\no\nn\npr ob ab\nil\nit\ny\ngraph paper.\nN\norma\nl\n\nfrequency distribution.\n\nis dominant over the other. In rare cases there are more than two modes (polymodal distributions)\n1.6.6 It turns out that most skewed distributions show the relation between mean, the median, and\nthe mode shown in Figure 1-16.\n\n1.7 Things About Sediment Size\n1.7.1 The size of material in a sediment is governed by two things, basically:\n- the size of material available, and\n- what has happened during transportation and deposition (complicated).\nIf only fine material is available, even an energetic transporting medium won't\nhave sand or gravel to transport. One of the firmest interpretations we can make in\nsedimentology is that the presence of a sand deposit indicates a relatively energetic\n\ntransporting medium, and a gravel deposit, even more so. (Assuming that the\n\nmaterial really was deposited, and is not weathered in place.)\nR\ne\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\nh\ni\np\n\na\nmong mean, median and mode.\nUnimodal\nand bimo\ndal freq\nuency di\nstributions.\nFigure 1-15: Unimodal and bimodal frequency distributions\nFigure 1-16: Cartoon of the relationships among the mean, the median, and the mode in a\nskewed frequency distribution\n\n1.7.2 In many river systems it's observed that sediment size decreases\nprogressively downstream. (This is called downstream fining.) Why?\nPossibilities:\n\n- permanent storage (sometimes certainly the case, sometimes certainly not\nthe case), together with size-selective deposition.. Laboratory experiments have\nshown that this can be a substantial effect, at least under certain conditions. It\nmakes sense, too, from the standpoint that the coarser particles are likely to be the\nones that are preferentially extracted from the through-going sediment to be\ndeposited.\n- All particles are transported start to finish, all are progressively abraded.\nThis certainly happens to some extent in gravel-size material, but there must be\nother factors involved too; it's unlikely that a boulder is continuously reduced to a\nsand grain. Probably much more important is:\n- fracturing of coarser particles to form lots of fine particles. Also probably\nimportant in some if not most cases:\n- weathering of sedimentary material as it resides in temporary alluvial\ndeposits awaiting further downstream transport (but this probably doesn't affect\nquartz debris very much). Also important in many cases:\n- dilution by fine material from tributaries.\n\n1.7.3 A case could be made for nature providing us with three dominant\nsediment sizes: gravel, sand and coarse silt, and clay, resulting respectively from\nbreaking along joints and bedding planes, granular disintegration and abrasion,\nand chemical decomposition. Many have proposed that there are indeed two\ndistinct gaps or dearths in natural size distributions, around 2 mm and at several\nmicrons.\n1.7.4 Mean size is seldom in the range 1-4 mm, and the feeling is that\nthere's an absolute volumetric deficiency of this size (but this isn't easy to prove).\nAlso, some have claimed to recognize a break around the medium to coarse silt\nsize. What might be the reasons for the suspected gaps?\n\n- not produced by rock disintegration or decomposition;\n- less stable chemically or mechanically in weathering and transportation.\n\nIt's also possible that hydraulic effects cause some sizes to be scarce as modal\nsizes, although volumetrically no less abundant overall.\n1.7.5 In summary, I think it's fair to say that although sediment size must\nhave great potential for interpreting the origin and deposition of sediments, it has\nnot yet become useful, because we don't yet fully understand its controls.\n\n2. SHAPE\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\n2.1.1 The other important textural aspect of individual grains is shape.\nSedimentologists have for a long time made a point of drawing a fundamental\ndistinction between two different aspects of shape:\n\nshape (sensu stricto): the whole-particle aspect of shape; this is usually\nviewed with reference to a sphere, so it's termed sphericity.\nroundness: the local aspect of shape, involving the sharpness, or lack\nthereof, of edges and corners.\n\n2.2 Sphericity\n\n2.2.1 It would be nice to have a unique and well-defined shape parameter\nthat can be assigned to any sediment particle. One good way of doing this is to\nwork from some reference shape. A sphere is often considered to be the best such\nreference shape, because it's claimed that the limiting shape assumed by\nhomogeneous and isotropic rock and mineral grains upon prolonged abrasion is a\nsphere. (But I'm not really sure this is true.)\n2.2.2 Sphericity is defined as the ratio of the nominal diameter of the\nparticle to the diameter of the circumscribed sphere. A sphere has a sphericity of\none, and particles of all other shapes have sphericities less than one.\n2.2.3 You can imagine, however, the difficulties of measuring the sphericity\nof a large number of sedimentary particles according to this definition--especially\ntiny sand grains!\n2.2.4 Another trouble with sphericity is that it doesn't distinguish among\ndifferent nonspherical shapes. A more specific thing to do is compare the shape of\nthe particle to that of a triaxial ellipsoid. This might still seem very artificial to\nyou, but lots of fairly well rounded sediment particles don't deviate greatly from\ntriaxial ellipsoids.\n2.2.5 Figure 1-17 shows the standard and time-honored way of classifying\nparticle shapes with reference to triaxial ellipsoids (or their equivalents in terms of\nrectangular solids). It was first proposed by Zingg, so the graph is called a Zingg\ndiagram. It's based on the three ratios of the principal axes of the triaxial\nellipsoid:\n\nL (or a): Long axis\nI (or b): Intermediate axis\nS (or c): Short axis\n\nFigure 1-18 is a chart for limiting values and terminology.\n\nVarious more detailed diagrams of the same kind, with more shape categories\nwithin the same graph, have been proposed since. You can even contour the\ndiagram with sphericity values (Figure 1-19).\n\n16Contouring the Zingg diagram.\nShape of sediment particles.\nLimiting values and terminology of particle-shape classes.\nFigure 1-17: The Zingg diagram\n\n, to describe the shape of sediment particles that can be\napproximated by triaxial ellipsoids\nFigure 1-18: Chart for limiting values and terminology of particle-shape classes in the\nZingg diagram\nLim\niting values and terminology of particle-shape classes.L\nConto\nuring the\nZingg\ndia\ng\nr\na\nm\n.\nI\n\ndimension perpendicular to both L and I (but not necessarily passing through\neither L or I). In practice this works fairly well except for really weird shapes.\n2.2.7 The Zingg diagram (or its more recent refinements) is about the best\nthat can be done for description, but it still doesn't deal adequately with the\nhydrodynamic aspects of shape. It would be nice to have a measure of shape that\ncorrelates well with the settling behavior of the particles.\n2.2.8 A sediment particle has a strong tendency to fall with its largest cross\nsection approximately horizontal, for reasons having to do with the distribution of\nfluid pressure over the surface of the particle. The resistance to fall is governed by\nthe difference in fluid pressure between the front (downward-facing) and back\n(upward-facing) surfaces and therefore by the largest cross-sectional area of the\nparticle. On the other hand, the weight of the particle, which is the driving force\nfor the settling in the first place, is proportional to the volume of the particle.\n\n2.2.6 When you try measuring the long, intermediate, and short axes of real\nsediment particles for yourself, you'll find some ambiguity in defining these axes\nfor irregular particles. What's usually done is to define L as the longest dimension\nthrough the particle, I as the longest dimension through the particle and\nperpendicular to L (but not necessarily intersecting L), and S as the longest\nFigure 1-19: Contouring the Zingg diagram by sphericity\nCon\ntou\nrin\ng t\nhe\nZin\ngg\ndia\ngra\nm\n.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n2.3 Roundness\n\n2.3.1 Roundness has to do with the sharpness of edges and corners of a rock\nor mineral particle, and is almost entirely independent of shape defined above.\n2.3.2 The official definition of roundness is this: the ratio of average radius\nof curvature of edges and corners to the radius of the largest inscribed sphere. A\nmuch more convenient alternative is to use the average radius of curvature of the\ncorners of the projected grain image, and an even easier alternative is to use the\nradius of curvature of the single sharpest corner around the projected grain image.\n2.3.3 But as you can easily imagine, even with simplifications this definition\nof roundness presents a formidable challenge to the measurer. When it's actually\ndone, it's done by projecting or enlarging a grain image, fitting radii somehow,\nmeasuring, and computing. With the advent of high technology, one can use all\nsorts of automated border-tracing programs to speed things up enormously, but\nmeasurement of roundness still is not (and may never be) a standard\nsedimentological procedure.\n2.3.4 Traditionally a series of five qualitative roundness grades has been\nused: angular, subangular, subrounded, rounded, and well rounded. Here are\nword descriptions of these grades:\n\n2.2.10 For a wide variety of regular shapes, there's a far better correlation\nbetween the MPS and settling velocity than between the sphericity defined above\nand settling velocity.\n\n2.2.9 With this physics as a basis, Sneed and Folk long ago proposed\nsomething called the Maximum Projection Sphericity (MPS). It's defined as the\nratio of the maximum cross-sectional area of the volume-equivalent sphere to the\nmaximum cross-sectional area of the particle itself. For a triaxial ellipsoid, here's\nthe mathematics:\nMaximum cross-sectional area of particle:\nπ\n4 LI\nVolume of particle:\nπ\n6 LIS\nDiameter of volume-equivalent sphere:\n3 LIS\nMaximum cross-sectional area of volume-equivalent sphere:\nπ\n4 (3 LIS) 2\nMaximum Projection Sphericity:\nπ\n4 (3 LIS) 2/π\n4 LI =\n3 S2\nLI\n\n(1.10)\n\n2.3.6 And don't forget about the possibility of shape-selective deposition,\nmentioned earlier in connection with downstream fining. That would affect the\naggregate shape and roundness properties of transported aggregates of grains, even\nthough the shapes of individual sediment particles didn't change during transport.\n2.3.7 The shape and roundness of clasts (mainly sand and gravel particles)\nhave always been thought to hold great potential value for interpreting the source,\ntransportation, and deposition of sediments. But there aren't many definitely\nestablished facts. One would like to know the answers to such important\nquestions as:\n\n- Do beach pebbles differ in shape from river pebbles?\n- Does wind round grains more effectively than water?\n- What is the lower size limit (if any) for rounding by wind or water?\n- Can quartz grains be rounded in one sedimentary cycle (and if so, how)?\n\nDespite lots of effort, so far there are only mixed results on the answers. There's a\nlarge literature on these matters, but I won't summarize it here. Suffice it to say\nthat shape studies have so far not been any more useful than size studies in\ninterpreting sediments.\n\n- Transport processes: distance, mode, medium (abrasion; corrosion;\nbreakage)\n- Nature of weathering\n- Inherent nature of material (crystal habit; mineral/rock cleavage; abrasional\nanisotropy; fracture anisotropy)\n- Original shape and roundness upon production (crystallization; fracture)\n2.3.5 What might shape and roundness of a sedimentary particle depend on?\nBut nobody actually applies these descriptions directly. What one does is use an\noutline comparison chart. They even sell little plastic cards, called grain-shape\ncomparators, which you can carry with you in the field to use when you're\nexamining grains in a hand specimen with a hand lens, or when you're looking at\na loose sediment with a hand lens or through a microscope.\nwell rounded: no original edges, corners or faces; original shape only\nsuggested by present shape\nrounded: original edges and corners smoothed to broad curves; original\nfaces almost gone; original shape still apparent\nsubrounded: considerable wear; edges and corners rounded; area or\noriginal faces reduced\nsubangular: some evidence of wear; edges and corners rounded to some\nextent; original faces only slightly modified\nangular: little evidence of wear; edges and corners sharp\n\n3.4 A simple geometrical property of such a packing arrangement is the\nporosity, defined as the volume of voids divided by the bulk volume for some\nvolume of the sediment large enough to be representative (i.e., containing a large\nnumber of grains). A somewhat more complicated but no less important property\nis the permeability, which describes the ease with which fluids can be forced\nthrough the porous sediment or rock under the influence of a gradient in fluid\npressure. There will be more detail on this important property of sediments and\nsedimentary rocks later in the course.\n\n3.3 Figure 1-20 is a cross-sectional view of a granular deposit. It's what a\nthin section of the deposit would look like if you impregnated the deposit with\nsomething to make it rigid and then cut a thin section. In such a section, you\nwon't see many actual grain contacts.\n3.2 The most natural assumption to make is that the detrital particles are\noriginally deposited in a gravitationally stable framework; that is, each grain\ncomes to rest on others below and is held there by its own weight. In aggregate,\nthe grains are thus all in mutual contact.\n3.1 As I hope you know already, the word texture is used in a very specific\nway in sedimentology: it refers to geometry on the scale of the constituent\nparticles. Two of the most important aspects of texture, size and shape, we've\ndealt with already. The other important aspect of texture comes under the term\npacking or fabric: the mutual arrangement of grains in the deposit. This brief but\nimportant section outlines some things about what might be termed the granular\norganization of detrital sediments and sedimentary rocks.\n3. OTHER THINGS ABOUT THE TEXTURE OF DETRITAL\nSEDIMENTS\n\n(2) Just because the particles are packed in mutual contact doesn't\nnecessarily mean that the packing arrangement is a stable one. The initial\npacking upon deposition is usually somewhat more open than the closest possible,\nand a little jiggling or spontaneous movement can cause the sediment to rearrange\nitself into closer packing. This might sound innocuous, but consider that while the\nparticles are in the process of rearranging themselves they are partly unsupported,\nso the rigidity of the framework disappears and the sediment can flow like a fluid.\nThis effect is called liquefaction. Augmenting this effect is the displacement of\nthat part of the pore fluid which all of a sudden finds itself in excess over what is\nneeded in the closer packing. These effects are what give rise to the very common\nand diverse kinds of soft-sediment deformation. There will be a little more on\nsuch deformation in the chapter on structures.\n3.6 What happens, in terms of geometry, when the sediment becomes\nlithified, by fairly deep burial? (Again I'm getting ahead of myself, because there\nwill be more detail in this on the chapter on diagenesis.)\n\n- Deposition of new (authigenic) mineral material in the pore spaces. This\nauthigenic material, finely to coarsely crystalline, is called cement. It's\nprecipitated from solution, and it is unrelated to what was in the deposit\nbefore burial.\n- Reorganization of the detrital framework itself, mainly by three processes:\n\ndeformation (change in shape) of the grains by intergranular forces. You can\nimagine the enormous magnitude of the forces per unit area that are brought\nto bear at grain contacts, in view of the great weight of overlying sediment\nthat such grain contacts have to support. Relatively soft grains, like\nsedimentary rock fragments, can be squashed into unrecognizability (Figure\n1-21). Relatively soft grains squashed into unrecognizability.\n\n21Relatively soft grains squashed into unrecognizability.\n- If they have any surface electric charge at all (and they typically do), very\nfine particles become surrounded by a layer of ions called the electric\ndouble layer, which if the salinity is low effectively cushions the particles\nfrom one another. The existence and importance of this electric double\nlayer is undoubted. I'll say a little more about it in the chapter on muds and\nshales.\n- A thin layer or cushion of water molecules may be present around the\nparticles, so the solid material of the particles may not really be in contact.\nThere's been considerable debate about the importance of such a water\nlayer, but the possibility of its existence should be borne in mind.\n(1) It's strictly true only for large particles, larger than something like a few\ntens of microns. Very fine particles weigh so little that forces of electrochemical\norigin are of equal importance. These forces have two important effects:\n3.5 Two complications connected with this idea of a gravitationally stable\nframework are worth mentioning at this point:\n\npressure suturing (growing together of grains by solution at contact points\nand reprecipitation nearby; see the chapter on sedimentary minerals)\nrecrystallization, a word that gets used for two different processes, both\nimportant: (i) reorganization of crystal geometry of a given mineral (think\nin terms of what happens to snow as it sits in a snowbank at temperature\nnot far below freezing); (ii) growth of crystals of certain newly stable\nminerals at the expense of crystals of the original detrital minerals which\nnow find themselves out of equilibrium\n\n3.7 All these things, both physical and chemical, that happen to a sediment\nduring and after lithification, but before what's considered to be metamorphic,\nwhen the original sedimentary nature of the rock is largely obscured, is called\ndiagenesis. It covers a great variety of processes that operate from \"early\" to\n\"late\". There will be more on diagenesis later in the course.\n3.8 The practical outcome of all this high-sounding discussion should be:\nhow do you look at the geometry of a sediment or a rock by hand lens or in thin\nsection? Figure 1-22 shows the standard way of viewing the granular\norganization of a detrital sediment or rock. The framework grains are the larger\ndetrital grains, which are in contact with one another, leaving voids among them.\nThe voids are filled with various kinds of void filler. The classic distinction is\nbetween cement and matrix. The term matrix is used for fine detritus that is\ndeposited in the interstices among the framework grains. Figure 1-22A shows a\nsediment with framework grains surrounded by precipitated mineral cement;\nFigure 1-22B shows a sediment with framework grains set in a matrix of fine\ndetrital sediment deposited at the same time as the framework grains.\n3.9 But here are four problems with this approach, in order of increasing\nseverity:\n\n- Cement and matrix can be present together in the same sediment.\n- If the void-filling material is fine-grained you often have a hard time telling\nmatrix from cement. You have to look at some thin sections to appreciate this.\n- The distinction between framework and matrix becomes unrealistic when\nthe sediment is poorly sorted (Figure 1-22C), especially if it's unimodal rather\nthan bimodal. You just have to live with that. The distinction between framework\nand matrix then becomes just conventional or arbitrary.\n\n22Relatively soft grains squashed into unrecognizability.Relatively soft grains squashed into unrecognizability.\n\n- Soft rock fragments can undergo a combination of deformation and\nrecrystallization to the point where their material surrounds the more durable\nframework grains as a uniform \"paste\" that looks just like matrix. There's been a\nlot of controversy over the years about the importance of this effect, but it's\ngenerally agreed to be important. You can see a whole spectrum of intermediate\ncases. So what you call matrix in a well diagenetized rock may or may not have\nanything to do with recrystallized original fine detritus.\n\n4. SEDIMENTARY MINERALS\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\n4.1.1 What are the most important sedimentary minerals (or, more\naccurately, sedimentary components, because polycrystalline aggregates of one\nkind or another, rock fragments being the most important, are also common\nconstituents of sediments and sedimentary rocks)? It's easy to list the common\ncomponents:\n\n23Granular organization of a classic sediment.\n\nquartz\nfeldspars\nrock fragments\ncalcite + aragonite\ndolomite\nclay minerals\nmicas\nheavy minerals\n\n(Not necessarily in order of importance.)\n4.1.2 Here I'll give some attention to the terrigenous or siliciclastic minerals\nof this list; the carbonate minerals will come later, in the section on carbonate\nsediments and rocks, and clay minerals in dealing with muds and shales.\n4.1.3 Some miscellaneous general points about sedimentary minerals:\n\n- Any mineral can be present in a siliciclastic sedimentary rock, but not\nmany are important.\n- There are fewer important terrigenous sedimentary minerals than there are\nimportant igneous and metamorphic minerals: for terrigenous rocks, weathering\ntends to get rid of them; the same is not true, however, for chemically precipitated\nrocks, because the range of physicochemical conditions in evaporating\nenvironments is very wide.\n- Because of the very wide range of temperature and pressure conditions\nunder which metamorphic rocks can be generated, and the restrictive regularities\nof crystallization in cooling silicate melts, most minerals in terrigenous\nsedimentary rocks are metamorphic (but this is not saying anything about\nvolumes; igneous minerals would certainly be more abundant).\n- For terrigenous rocks, the same minerals don't have the same significance\nin a sedimentary rock as in igneous and metamorphic rocks. The minerals in this\nkind of sedimentary rock are not necessarily in equilibrium with each other or\nwith their environment. Each mineral grain has its own history, and each is an\nindependent variable in the total characterization of the rock.\n- A further complication, which you will inevitably run into when you look\nat clastic sedimentary rocks in thin section, is that the same mineral can be present\nin a rock for both equilibrium and disequilibrium reasons, i.e., the same mineral\ncan be present in a rock in both detrital and authigenic form. (How do you figure\nthis out?)\n\n4.2 Quartz\n\n4.2.1 Quartz is probably the single most important sedimentary mineral. It\nconstitutes something like 25% of all sediments in the continental crust. The\nfigure is much higher for most coarse-grained rocks, but very low in fine-grained\n\nrocks and carbonate rocks. Here we're dealing with the relative proportions of\n(nonweatherable) quartz vs. (weathering-product) clay minerals from the source\nrocks; we shouldn't expect the proportions to differ too much from those in the\nsource rocks, in terms of quartz versus clay minerals. As a group, the clay\nminerals are more abundant than quartz. The clay minerals are a group that's\nfairly homogeneous in form, occurrence, and general mineralogy, but no single\nmineral is dominant; more on clay minerals later.\n4.2.2 Two factors contribute to the predominance of quartz as a sedimentary\nmineral:\n\n- It's moderately abundant in crystalline source rocks; it forms perhaps 10-\n20% of the average igneous or metamorphic rock.\n- It's virtually indestructible by weathering (at least mechanical) and\ntransportation, whereas all other important source minerals are much more easily\ndestroyed by weathering and/or transportation (mainly the former). All other\nhighly stable igneous and metamorphic minerals, like zircon, are negligible\nvolumetrically in source rocks, so even though they pass right through the\nsedimentary cycle unscathed, we don't see much of them.\n\n4.2.3 There are five naturally occurring silica minerals:\nstishovite: ultra-high T and P form, dense (4.3 g/cm3), 1200° C, 105 atm. Present\nin meteor craters.\ncoesite: a high-P, high-T form of SiO2, several 100° C, a few 1000 atm P.\nProducible in the laboratory, and formed under conditions like meteorite impact.\ntridymite, cristobalite: high-T forms of SiO2 found in various volcanic rocks\n(even abundantly, in some cases), but of negligible sedimentological importance\n(because of low resistance to chemical weathering).\nquartz: two forms, high quartz and low quartz, related by a nonreplacive (\"flip-\nover\") inversion at 573°C. Whether the quartz originally crystallized as high or\nlow, all quartz in sedimentary rocks is of course now low quartz. There's a slight\nchange in c/a axial ratio in the high-low inversion, about 0.3%; this promotes\nfracturing. The two forms have a different crystal habit, but this is\nsedimentologically unimportant.\n4.2.4 Miscellaneous mineralogical points about quartz:\n\n- Quartz is virtually a pure substance; there isn't even limited isomorphous\nsubstitution or solid solution. All quartz contains trace elements, however, and\nthis is beginning to be used in provenance studies.\n- Quartz is stable at surface T and P, and under all T and P conditions of\nsedimentary processes, as well as under almost all igneous and metamorphic\nconditions. The reason we don't see quartz in things like basalts is compositional,\nnot T and P stability. Quartz is almost universally stable; it's not around just\n\nbecause of low-temperature metastability. (But this is not to say there are not\nsolution reactions that can eliminate quartz from sedimentary rocks; there are.)\n- The solubility of quartz in pure water is extremely small, something like\n10-15 ppm. This is measured indirectly: if we put a chunk of quartz in pure water,\nwe would have to wait a prohibitively long time to see this equilibrium\nconcentration of SiO2 in solution. Most silica probably gets into solution by\nweathering of silicate minerals, or solution of amorphous silica in preexisting\nsediments (less important), not by solution of quartz.\n- As noted in the chapter on shape and roundness, abrasion of quartz during\ntransportation is small but nonnegligible. Transportation by wind reduces quartz\ngrains much faster than does transportation by water. We still don't know whether\nwell rounded quartz grains are mainly the result of (1) extreme multicycle\nsubaqueous abrasion (traditional view); (2) desert wind action; (3) slight\npreferential solution of silica at edges and corners while temporarily stored in\ntransport (untested possibility). Or perhaps some mix of these processes.\n\n4.2.5 Because of the very low solubility of quartz, a good general rule in\nsedimentary petrology is that as much quartz should reach sedimentary basins as\nleaves the source area (although not necessarily in the same shape and size).\n4.2.6 What's the provenance of quartz? (The word provenance is used to\ndescribe the place and/or the materials from which a sediment is derived.) The\nprovenance of quartz grains is varied: the ultimate source of detrital quartz is\nigneous and metamorphic rocks, but obviously preexisting quartz-bearing\nsedimentary rocks provide detrital quartz too. A certain percentage, very high in\nsome areas, is recycled from such preexisting sedimentary rocks.\n4.2.7 Here's a brief rundown on the particulate form of quartz as a function\nof grain size:\n\n- Most gravel-size quartz clasts are derived from vein quartz; they're usually\npolycrystalline and milky white.\n- Sand-size quartz consists mainly of single quartz crystals, but also\npolycrystalline grains, either quartzite grains, recrystallized chert, or\nprimary crystalline aggregates from crystalline source rocks.\n- Silt-size quartz grains are almost exclusively single-crystal grains\n(derivation: fine-grained metamorphic rocks; preexisting fine-grained\nsediments; chipping and spalling of larger grains, perhaps mainly in\ndeserts).\n- There's not much clay-size quartz around to worry about.\n\n4.2.8 What's the size of quartz grains in sedimentary rocks? It ranges from\nmiddling gravel sizes down into the very coarsest clay sizes. There's almost no\nquartz < 2 μm (and unfortunately, the clay-silt boundary is at 4 μm). I mentioned\nearlier that there seems to be a shortage of terrigenous sedimentary material\n\naround 1-4 mm. Because quartz is the predominant clastic component in those\nsizes, this shortage must largely be tied up with the overall size distribution of\nsedimentary quartz grains. The following line of reasoning seems to be on firm\nground:\n\n- The size of quartz grains in sediments is determined largely by the size of\nthe quartz grains in the source rocks, as modified by breakage, wear, and solution.\n(I'm unsure in detail about the relative or absolute importance of each of these.)\n- The quartz-bearing plutonic rocks (mainly granitic igneous rocks, gneisses,\nand schists) are the ultimate source of almost all detrital quartz. But what is\nmeant by ultimate? Most of the quartz from metamorphic rocks started out as\nsedimentary quartz. But the distinction between sedimentary and metamorphic\nquartz is significant for provenance studies.\n- Granitic source rocks produce only a small proportion of grains larger\nthan 1 mm: although perhaps one-quarter of quartz grains in the average granitic\nrock are larger than 1 mm, it's been estimated that so many of these are fractured\nthat only about 10% of quartz grains from granitic rocks are larger than 1 mm (and\nonly about 20% larger than 0.6 mm).\n\n4.2.9 But how about silt-size quartz in the sedimentary cycle? It could be\neither source-dependent (from breakdown of fine-grained quartz-bearing\ncrystalline rocks, phyllites being the only obvious possibility), or process-\ndependent (formed from coarser quartz particles by some process or processes).\nHere are some possibilities for processes of silt-size quartz production:\n\n- Spalling of silt-size quartz grains from sand-size quartz grains upon impact\nduring wind transport;\n- Glacial grinding and crushing of quartz sand;\n- Production somehow in other environments?\n\n4.2.10 Because quartz is such a stable and abundant sedimentary mineral (to\nthe extent that in many sedimentary rocks it is the only detrital mineral present in\nappreciable proportions), much effort has been expended in trying to develop and\napply criteria based on features of detrital quartz grains for determining the\nnature of the source rocks. Here I'll discuss, briefly, four major features of this\nkind: shape, inclusions, strain shadows, and polycrystallinity.\n4.2.11 Quartz grains obviously vary a lot in shape, but they tend to be\nequigranular or spheroidal (which term seems better sort of depends on how well\nrounded the grain is). They always show more or less elongation, however, and\nthis tends to be along the sixfold crystallographic axis of the quartz grain. Why?\nTwo possibilities:\n\n- anisotropic abrasion properties caused by crystallographic anisotropy;\n- quartz grains of source rocks crystallized elongated in this way.\n\nThe latter possibility seems to be the case; quartz seems to be virtually isotropic\nwith respect to abrasion even though it is anisotropic with respect to crystal\nstructure.\n4.2.12 Quartz forms anhedral grains in most crystalline rocks. And quartz\nhas absolutely no mineral cleavage. So almost all quartz grains are very irregular\nin shape and roundness from the beginning (neither highly angular nor highly\ninequigranular). When quartz crystallizes freely, it forms doubly terminated\npyramids--but such crystals are extremely uncommon in sedimentary rocks; you\nrarely see a euhedral detrital quartz grain. Crushed quartz looks different; but we\nalmost never have to deal with crushed quartz in natural situations.\n4.2.13 There's conflicting evidence on whether quartz grains from schists\nand gneisses tend to be more elongated than those from coarse-grained igneous\nrocks. For a long time this was assumed to be so, without any careful and\nextensive and systematic measurements. But more recent studies have shown that\nthis is not strongly the case, if at all. It seems to be generally thought now that\nnothing much can be said about either provenance or transport history by\nstudying the shapes of quartz grains in a detrital sediment.\n\n4.3 Feldspars\n\n4.3.1 Feldspar is the second-most-important coarse detrital mineral in\nsedimentary rocks. It's subordinate to quartz in sedimentary rocks, and on the\naverage it's sharply subordinate: the average sandstone contains something like\n10-12% feldspar (mainly detrital). (Fine-grained terrigenous rocks contain at least\nthis much on the average, but it's hard to tell how much is detrital and how much\nis authigenic; probably more authigenic than detrital.) Another important fact is\nthat feldspar content is much more variable than quartz content: some detrital\nrocks contain almost no feldspar, whereas others contain more feldspar than\nquartz.\n4.3.2 Although it's hard to sample representatively, there's a real increase in\nthe average feldspar content of terrigenous rocks from the early Paleozoic to the\npresent: Pre-Pennsylvanian, about 2%, and Cenozoic, about 25%. WHY? There\nare only four logical possibilities for why there's less feldspar in older sandstones:\n\n- source: less got in, because typical source rocks had less feldspar. [seems\nunlikely]\n- weathering: less got in, because typical relief and/or climate was more\nconducive to elimination of feldspar. [seems unlikely]\n- preservation: the same amount got in, but rocks with more feldspar have\nbeen preferentially destroyed. [seems reasonable]\n- dissolution: the same amount got in, but the rocks have had more chance for\nfeldspar to be dissolved out or altered by pore waters. [seems reasonable]\n\n4.3.3 With regard to composition, every known variety of feldspar in\ncrystalline rocks is found also in sedimentary rocks, but:\n\n- certain kinds of dominant, and others are rare;\n- the proportions of the various feldspars in sedimentary rocks are markedly\ndifferent from in crystalline source rocks.\n\nPlagioclase is an important constituent of crystalline source rocks, but it's not\nabundant in sedimentary rocks; it's strongly subordinate to Kspars, which are the\ndominant feldspars in sedimentary rocks. Also, the more sodic plagioclases are\nmore common than the more calcic plagioclases. Of the Kspars, microcline is\nsomewhat more common than orthoclase, but both are very common. Sanidine,\non the other hand, is rare.\n4.3.4 What's the provenance of feldspar in sedimentary rocks? The Kspar\ncomes mainly from coarse-grained felsic (granitic) igneous rocks and gneisses.\nPlagioclase comes mainly from intermediate to mafic igneous rocks, as well as\nplagioclase-bearing metamorphic rocks. Sedimentary and volcanic sources seem\nto be unimportant.\n4.3.5 The percentage of detrital feldspar in sedimentary rocks is\nsignificantly less than in the source rocks--something like one-fifth as much.\nThis is certainly caused at least in part by chemical weathering of feldspar at the\nsource. It's observed that feldspars are unstable during weathering in soils, and\nthat the various feldspars vary in their resistance to weathering, and that these\ndiffering resistances correspond to the differing abundances of feldspar in\nsedimentary rocks. You can further feel confident that if you find a sedimentary\nrock with a lot of potentially unstable feldspar, like calcic plagioclase, there must\nhave been some special conditions such that weathering did not have enough\nchance to operate (either not enough time or not enough intensity, or both).\n4.3.6 What about the possibility that the feldspar is eliminated also in part by\nmechanical abrasion during transport (or this plus chemical weathering while in\ntemporary storage)? Careful abrasion experiments have shown that abrasion of\nfeldspar is twice as fast as of quartz but still insignificant in subaqueous transport.\nSo it seems that the percentage of sand-size feldspar in a river can be reduced only\nby dilution or by chemical weathering along the way.\n4.3.7 It was long believed that for feldspar to survive weathering and\ntransportation and be deposited in substantial quantities in a sediment requires\nvery special climatic conditions: very arid (not much water to facilitate chemical\ndecomposition) and/or very cold (low temperatures retard chemical\ndecomposition). But it gradually became clear that highly feldspathic sediments\naccumulate in very wet and hot climates. Another piece of evidence is the\npresence of tropical flora in feldspar-rich sandstones. And the mere presence of\naltered feldspar along with fresh feldspar in the same rock, which is very common,\nindicates something is wrong with \"cold dry climate\" theory.\n\n4.3.8 Probably more important than climate is the relief of the source area.\nClimate controls the intensity of weathering, but relief controls the time available\nfor weathering. Even in a climate with intense weathering, if the relief is very\ngreat the rocks are eroded very rapidly, so there's not enough time for weathering\nto destroy feldspar. But if relief is low, the rate of erosion is so slow that if the\nclimate is favorable, all the feldspar is destroyed. The presence or absence of\nfeldspar is thus controlled by the balance between rate of weathering and rate of\nerosion. Detrital feldspar is an index of both climate and relief. What causes high\nrelief? Uplift. Thus, feldspar in sediments should indicate tectonic activity in the\nsource area.\n\n4.4 Rock Fragments\n\n4.4.1 Petrologically, a rock fragment is a detrital component or clast that is\nlarge enough relative to the grain size of the source rock so as to be petrologically\nrepresentative of the source rock from which it was derived. The size limitations\non rock fragments should be obvious: a source rock can't yield rock fragments\nfiner than the constituent mineral grains of the rock! Thus, coarse-grained\nplutonic rocks can produce gravel-size rock fragments but not sand-size rock\nfragments.\n4.4.2 The nice thing about rock fragments is that they are a great way of\ntelling provenance: it's like having little chunks of source-rock outcrops delivered\nto your door. The trouble is that the rock fragments that are delivered may not\n(and are usually almost certainly not) representative of all the rocks in the source\narea, because of differing resistance to weathering and/or scale of fragmentation.\nAlso, for sandstones, the only rock fragments you will see are very fine-grained,\nand it's difficult to do careful petrographic work on such fine-grained rock\nfragments.\n4.4.3 Rock fragments are moderately abundant: perhaps 10-15% of average\nsandstone. But percentages vary widely, from almost zero to almost all the\nframework. Here are the most important kinds of rock fragments of sand size:\n\n- volcanic igneous. Usually so fine-grained that they are hard to identify.\nUsually felsic rocks, because they are more resistant to chemical\nweathering than mafic rocks. They are often hard to distinguish from\nimpure chert. Mafic volcanic rock fragments are easier to identify but are\nless common in most sandstones.\n- metamorphic. The whole range of foliated fragments from the series shale-\nphyllite-schist are common. Usually they show a high percentage of\nmicaceous material with preferred orientation, and are therefore fairly easy\nto identify.\n\n- sedimentary. Chert is probably the most common, and is usually easy to\nidentify. Shale and mudstone clasts are also common, and grade over into\nmetamorphic rock fragments.\n\n4.4.4 Rock fragments are usually counterposed to feldspars in interpreting\nprovenance of sedimentary rocks: both have about the same resistance to\nweathering (to first order), and both are abundant in source rocks (potentially\nproduced in large quantities). Feldspar tends to come from deep-seated rocks,\nrock fragments from shallow-seated rocks. So the ratio of feldspar to rock\nfragments is usually considered to be a good first-order guide to source-rock\ncomposition. This measure is far from perfect, however, because\n\n- the proportions of feldspar and fine-grained rocks vary in the source areas,\nand\n- the weatherabilities of feldspars and rock fragments are not identical.\n\n4.4.5 Also, the ratio of quartz to the aggregate of feldspar and rock\nfragments is a good guide to what could be called the maturity of a sedimentary\nrock. The maturity of a detrital sedimentary rock is the extent to which the\nsediment approaches the end product to which it is driven by the sedimentary\nprocesses (like weathering and transport) that operate on it. The ultimate end\nproduct is an aggregate of well-sorted and well-rounded quartz grains plus a small\npercentage of highly stable heavy minerals like zircon and tourmaline. This\nmeasure isn't perfect either, however, because the initial proportions of quartz and\nother constituents vary greatly in the source rocks.\n\n4.5 Micas\n\n4.5.1 With regard to mica particles in detrital sediments, it's nice to think in\nterms of\n\n- large detrital mica flakes\n- fine interstitial clay-mineral particles\n\nBut often there's no break in the size distribution of the micas, or even any\nbimodality in the distribution, so we can't make this distinction. Also, there's lots\nof authigenic clay-mineral material in many sedimentary rocks, and you may not\nbe able to distinguish detrital from authigenic. (Some of the authigenic is derived\nfrom the detrital, and some is derived from alteration of feldspars.) I'll\nconcentrate here on the coarse detrital micas, and deal with the fine stuff in the\nchapter on muds and shales.\n4.5.2 Muscovite, biotite, and chlorite are all common, but muscovite is far\nmore abundant that biotite or detrital chlorite.\n\nmuscovite: the most stable, both chemically and mechanically.\n\nbiotite: undergoes chemical weathering fairly readily, largely to fine-grained\nchlorite.\nchlorite: tends to break down into fine particles and be present as a \"clay\nmineral\" constituent. It's also very common as an incipient metamorphic\nmineral in shales and slates.\n\n4.5.3 In most sandstones, muscovite is a minor constituent, a few percent,\nbut it is ubiquitous. It commonly gets concentrated on bedding planes, by settling\nhorizontally onto the sediment surface at times of weaker currents. This tends to\nfacilitate parting at that bedding plane, because the excellent cleavage in the mica\nmakes that bedding plane a little weaker when the sediment is lithified. Much of\nthe parting (that is, splitting along bedding surfraces) seen in detrital sedimentary\nrocks is caused just by greater concentrations of muscovite.\n4.5.4 Muscovite characteristically has a much lower settling velocity than\nchunky detrital grains of the same mass. So you tend to find muscovite together\nwith much finer detritus. The hydrodynamic reason, in a nutshell, is this: flaky\nparticles tend to settle with their planes horizontal, and the fluid drag force is\nabout proportional to the \"frontal area\" of the settling particle. Figure 1-23 shows\ntwo particles of the same volume. The flake has the larger frontal area, and so the\nnecessary balance between the weight and the drag force is struck at a smaller\nsettling velocity.\n\n4.6 Heavy Minerals\n\n4.6.1 The heavy minerals (often just called heavies) of detrital sedimentary\nrocks are a large and nongenetic mineral group. The minerals are not necessarily\nrelated to each other in any way: it's the operational procedure in separating them\nfrom the sediment that defines them as group. By definition, the density of heavy\nminerals is greater than that of some heavy organic liquid, about 2.9 g/cm3\n(usually bromoform or tetrabromoethane). It's a mineralogical fact of nature that\nthe major sedimentary minerals (quartz, feldspars, carbonates) are around 2.65\ng/cm3 in density, and the minor minerals are mostly much heavier.\n4.6.2 Operationally, the heavies are usually treated in two different groups:\nopaque (\"ore\") minerals and nonopaque minerals. These two groups have to be\nstudied by different microscopic techniques. The nonopaque minerals can be\nstudied by transmitted light, just like the light minerals, whereas the opaque\nminerals are studied like ores, in reflected light. The opaque minerals therefore\ntend to be ignored by sedimentary petrologists.\n4.6.3 Unless you are dealing with a placer deposit (a placer is a sedimentary\naccumulation of heavy-mineral grains rich enough to be economically workable)\nheavies almost always form less than 1% of the sediment, and usually less than\n0.1%. For this reason, you don't often even see heavy-mineral grains in thin\nsection! But an important point to remember is that the heavy-mineral fraction of\n\na detrital rock contains almost all the minerals present in that rock. If only for\nthis reason alone, they are of more than casual interest.\n4.6.4 The heavy minerals, opaque and nonopaque together, fall into two\nbroad categories:\n- Very stable minor accessory minerals of the source rocks. These aren't\nabundant in the source rock, but they are so resistant to weathering and abrasion\nthat they get into the sediment anyway. As with quartz, it's safe to assume for\nthese minerals that as much gets into the sediment as leaves the source area.\nHere's a list of some of the common stable heavy minerals:\nzircon\ntourmaline\nrutile\nanatase\nbrookite\ngarnet\nmagnetite\nilmenite\napatite\ntitanite\n- Surviving remnants of abundant but unstable femags in the source rocks.\nTo the extent that these escape weathering, they get into the sediment, so\ndepending on the particular conditions they can either be very abundant or (more\nlikely) rare or entirely absent. Examples: olivine, pyroxenes, amphiboles,\nstaurolite, kyanite, sillimanite.\n\nSome minerals, like garnet, fall in between these two categories.\n4.6.5 Here are two interpretive uses of heavy minerals:\n\n- delineation of petrographic provinces: in coastal marine geology, it's\ncommon to study the heavy-mineral content of detrital sediments to delineate the\ndifferent continental source areas of the sediments. Theoretically this could be\ndone for ancient rocks as well, but the difficulties are increased because of loss of\nthree-dimensional control.\n- identification of type of crystalline source rocks: It would be nice to use\nheavy minerals as a guide to the provenance of a sedimentary rock: what were the\nsource rocks? To some extent we can do a fairly good job in using the heavy\nminerals to tell what the source rocks were, at least ultimately. Minerals like\nzircon, sphene, monazite, and pink tourmaline are characteristic of granitic rocks;\ngarnet, kyanite, sillimanite, staurolite, and epidote, of medium to high grade\nmetamorphics. But obviously the great variety of source rocks and mixing from a\nnumber of different sources often makes this kind of approach difficult.\n\n4.6.6 Here are two significant things about heavy minerals:\n\n- The heavies tend to be in the finest fractions of the detritus. Their greater\ndensity means that their settling velocity is greater for a given mass, so finer\nheavies tend to be deposited with coarser lights. (This is a considerable\noversimplification of what's called hydraulic equivalence of light and heavy\nminerals; you have to worry about traction as well as settling. I can't pursue this\nhere.)\n- In a succession of interbedded sandstones and shales, the number of\nheavies is much greater in the shales than in the sandstones; the greater\npermeability of sandstones has allowed dissolution or transformation of the\nheavies, whereas the impermeable shales have retained their original heavy-\nmineral content. So if you are looking for heavies, look in fine-grained rocks.\n\n5. CLASSIFICATION OF DETRITAL SEDIMENTS\n\n5.1 The fundamental classification of detrital sediments is by particle size.\nThat said, however, I think I should point out that such a classification tends to be\ntreated rather informally by most sedimentologists. The major size categories are\ngravel, sand, and mud, the first being subdivided into pebbles, cobbles, and\nboulders, and the last being subdivided into silt and clay. The boundaries are as\ngiven by the Udden-Wentworth grade scale, which is now conventional in the\nEarth sciences, at least in English-speaking countries. The Udden-Wentworth\ngrade scale is based on powers of two; each successive power of two coarser than\nthe preceding by one phi unit (see Section 1 above). Figure 1-24 shows this grade\nscale, and its conventional terminology. Especially in the sand sizes, the\nadjectives, ranging from very fine to very coarse, are heavily used in practice.\nAnd the finer subdivisions of sand are often split even further--for example into\nupper fine or lower medium--even when working with a hand lens and a grain-\nsize comparator in the field.\n5.2 The classification shown in Figure 1-24 would be very nice if sediments\nwere always very well sorted. In real life, however, there is always a spread of\nsizes around the mean size. What does one do about naming a sediment when one\nor both of its size-distribution tails laps over into another size category?\n\nThe Udden-Wentworth grad scale.\n5.3\nVarious classifications of mixed-size sediments have been\nproposed. Two such classifications are shown in Figure 1-25. The\none on the left is very logical and symmetrical but largely ignores\nthe real world of naming mixed sediments, and the one on the right,\nwhile asymmetrical, takes greater account of actual\nsedimentological practice. I don't want to denigrate any aspect of\nsedimentary geology in this course, but I think it's reasonable to\npoint out here that not many sedimentologists worry much about\nthe precise placement of boundaries in classifications like this: they\njust use their own judgment or predilections or prejudices in giving\na name to a mixed sediment.\n\nC\nl\na\ns\ns\ni\nf\ni\ncati\nons\nof s\nedim\nents\n.\n\nFigure 1-25: Several different classifications of sediments that contain mixtures of the\nvarious named size classes"

      "content": "Chapter 2\n\nPHYSICS OF SEDIMENTATION\n\n1. A FLUID DYNAMICS FIELD TRIP\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\n1.1.1 In dealing with the production and significance of flow-produced sed-\nimentary structures and textures, it helps to know something about the flows in\nwhich they were produced. On the other hand, we can't assume that you've had\ncourses in fluid dynamics. So here's some relatively painless background on fluid\ndynamics.\n1.1.2 What we've done here is imagine that we are out looking at the flow in\na large river and provide some qualitative material on the most important aspects\nof the flow that you could observe for yourselves. That should go a long way\ntoward providing important background without spending inordinate time.\n\n1.2 Variables\n\n1.2.1 Two of the most important physical properties of fluids are density and\nviscosity. The density of a fluid, denoted by ρ, is the mass of fluid per unit volume\nof fluid. The density of water is very close to one gram per cubic centimeter (1\ng/cm3) or one thousand kilograms per cubic meter (103 kg/m3). The density of air\nat sea level and room temperature is far smaller, by a factor of about 800.\n1.2.2 The viscosity of a fluid, usually denoted by μ, is a measure of the re-\nsistance of the fluid to deformation. Imagine that you sheared a fluid by placing it\nbetween two parallel plates and then moving the plates parallel to each other\n(Figure 2-1). The greater the relative speed of the plates, the greater the force\nneeded to maintain the shearing of the fluid. The viscosity is the coefficient as-\nsociated with the ratio between the force (measured per unit area in the planes of\nshear) that resists the shearing, on the one hand, and the rate of shearing, on the\nother hand.\n\nS\nh\ne\na\nr\ni\nn\ng\na fluid between two parallel plates.\n\n1.2.3 One more fluid property, the specific weight, usually denoted by γ , is\nimportant when the fluid is in a gravitational field, as on the Earth's surface. The\nspecific weight is the weight of the fluid per unit volume of fluid.\n1.2.4 There's a wealth of variables you can use to describe the flow. Some\nare more concrete and easy to understand than others. On the one hand, you can\nthink about the velocity of the flow, and on the other hand, you can think about the\nforce per unit area the flow exerts on its boundary.\n1.2.5 With regard to velocity, if you occupied any point in the flow that's\nfixed relative to the boundaries and used a magic little velocity meter to measure\nthe local fluid velocity, you'd get some stable local time-averaged velocity if you\ncontinued your measurement for a fairly long time. This time-average local ve-\nlocity varies continuously from point to point all over the cross section of the flow\n(Figure 2-2); more on what that distribution of local velocity looks like presently.\n\nTime-average local ve¬locity.\n\n1.2.6 You can take the average of all the local velocities all over the flow\ncross section to get a mean flow velocity U (Figure 2-3). In real rivers this is how\nit's actually done, but in laboratory channels, where it's easy to know the water\ndischarge (the volume rate of flow), you can use the relationship Q = UA, where Q\nis the discharge and A is the area of the flow cross section, to find U.\nCross-section mean flow velocity.\n\n1.2.7\nYou could also measure the surface velocity Us along the\ncenterline of the flow (Figure 2-4). This is greater than the mean\nvelocity, by a factor of something like 1.2 or 1.3; it's related to U\nin a rather complex way that needn't concern us here.\nIncidentally, unless the channel is very wide compared with the\ndepth of flow the position of maximum velocity on the cross\nsection lies a little below the surface.\nSurface velocity.\n\n1.2.8 The boundary shear stress τo is a little trickier to deal with than veloc-\nity, and is less concrete to visualize, but it's important for the obvious reason that\nit's what exerts forces on the sediment particles on the bed.\n1.2.9 Let's backtrack a little to point out something about the flow near the\nboundary that may seem counterintuitive to you, but stands as a firmly established\nfact of observation: fluid in direct contact with a solid boundary has exactly the\nsame velocity as that solid boundary. That's called the no-slip condition. In the\ncontext of our river flow, it means that the water right at the bed has zero velocity.\nBut of course there's an increase in velocity upward from the bed, so all the water\nabove the bed, no matter how small a distance above, generally has a nonzero\nvelocity.\n1.2.10 The reason we've brought in the no-slip condition here is this: the\norigin of shear stresses in fluids is just the existence of shearing itself. The\nstronger the shearing, the greater the shear stress that's generated, other things\nbeing equal. And foremost among those other things is the viscosity, introduced\nabove: the viscosity is just the coefficient that relates the shear stress to the shear\nin a given fluid.\n1.2.11 So, back to the boundary shear stress τo. It's true that if you could get\nright down close to any point on the bed, you could (with the right instrument,\nwhich doesn't actually exist!) measure a local shearing force per unit area the flow\nexerts on the solid boundary. That fits the term \"boundary shear stress\" well, but\nit's not what's conventionally meant by the boundary shear stress. What you have\nto do is take a spatial average of the local downstream-directed component of the\nfluid force acting on the bed over an area large enough to include a large number\nof representative \"roughness elements\" (sediment particles or bed forms).\n\n1.2.12 Finally there's the matter of flow power. There's a school of thought\n(with which I don't agree) that the flow power is the most fundamental determi-\nnant of sediment transport. We'll just state to you, without further development,\nthat in a channel flow like a river the flow power comes out to be equal to the\nproduct of the boundary shear stress τo and the mean velocity U. Those of you so\ninclined might try your hand at figuring that out from the first principles embodied\nin Newton's laws; it's not as formidable as it seems at first thought.\n\n1.3 Why Do Fluids Move?\n\n1.3.1 The movement of fluids is part of the experience of our daily lives.\nBut it's important to think for a moment about why fluids move. According to\nNewton's first law, a body moves in a state of uniform motion (changing neither\nspeed nor direction) unless it is acted upon by some force. Moving fluids are\nalways acted upon by friction, so they come to rest unless some other force is\navailable to offset the friction and keep them in motion.\n\n1.3.2 Two important kinds of forces drive fluid motions:\n\nθ\nThe force of gravity. In a flow down a sloping channel, the weight of\nan element of fluid has a downslope component (Figure 2-5). This\ndownslope component of fluid weight counterbalances the frictional\nresistance exerted on the fluid by the bottom boundary.\n\nForce balance.\n\nθ\nPressure gradients. In a flow in a horizontal pipe or conduit, the\nfluid moves only if there's a downstream decrease in fluid pressure.\nTo see why this causes the fluid to move, look at an element of fluid\nin the pipe (Figure 2-6). If there's a downstream pressure gradient\n(that is, the pressure decreases in the downstream direction), then the\nforce on the upstream face of the element is greater than the force on\nthe downstream face. The difference in forces on the upstream and\ndownstream faces is a force directed downstream. This downstream\n\nforce counterbalances the frictional resistance exerted on the fluid by\nthe walls of the pipe.\nFluid moves in a pipe or conduit.\n\n1.3.3 In a general fluid flow, both of these kinds of forces (downslope gravity\ncomponents and downstream pressure gradients) can be present at the same time,\nand the fluid moves under their combined effect.\n\n1.4 Channel Flows\n\n1.4.1 Now let's think about what the flow really looks like in a large channel\nflow like a river. The basic picture is as shown in Figure 2-5: there's a balance\nbetween the downchannel pull of gravity on the fluid, which acts throughout the\nflow (in some physics course you may have heard gravity described as a \"body\nforce\") and the resistance force the bed and banks exert on the flowing fluid,\nwhich is equal and opposite to the boundary shear stress we discussed above. A\nnatural consequence of the action of these two different forces--gravity acting\nthroughout the fluid and the resistance force acting only at the boundary--is that\nthe velocity increases upward in the flow, from zero at the boundary, by the no-\nslip condition, to a maximum at or near the surface.\n\n1.4.2 That's only the crudest first-order picture, though: the question comes\nnaturally to mind: what are the details of the distribution of time-average local\nflow velocity over the entire cross section of the flow? That's much too intricate a\nquestion for us to pursue here, so we'll just hit the high points.\n\n1.4.3 It's simplest to think about a river with a large width-to-depth ratio,\nwhich is usually the case. Then we can forget about the effect of the banks. A\nstraightforward application of Newton's laws shows that the distribution of ve-\nlocity should be parabolic (Figure 2-7A), with the vertex of one limb of a\nparabola located at the surface.\n\nLaminar\nand t\nurbulent velocity profiles.\n\nFigure 2-7: Laminar and turbulent velocity profiles in channel flow\n\n1.4.4 But if you went out and measured the local time-average velocity at a\nseries of points along a vertical from the surface down to the bottom, you'd find\nthe actual distribution to be far from parabolic: the distribution would be much\nmore uniform over most of the flow depth, and the necessary decrease to zero at\nthe boundary would be in a very thin zone right next to the boundary. The dis-\ntribution would closely approximate a logarithmic distribution (Figure 2-7B), for\nreasons that go way beyond the scope of this course.\n1.4.5 This discrepancy has to do with the difference between laminar flow\nand turbulent flow, which we're sure you've all heard about one way or another.\nChannel flows that are very shallow and/or very slow-flowing (like sheet flow or\noverland flow on the land surface during and after a rain) are characterized by the\nregular and locally rectilinear flow trajectories of laminar flow (Figure 2-8A),\nwhereas channel flows that are deeper and/or faster-moving (almost all\nchannelized flows fall into this category) show the irregularly sinuous flow tra-\njectories characteristic of turbulent flow (Figure 2-8B).\n\nP\na\nt\nh\ns\n\no\nf fluid elements in laminar and turbulent flow.\n\n1.4.6 Turbulence isn't easy to describe. But because it's such an important\naspect of sediment transport, we'll attempt to give you a qualitative picture of what\nturbulence is like in a flow like in a channel flow. One way of studying turbulence\nis to make a continuous measurement of velocity as a function of time at a fixed\npoint in the flow. You'd obtain a record that looks something like the graph shown\nin Figure 2-9: velocity fluctuations with a range of magnitudes and time scales\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nwould be present around the time-average velocity. Another way of seeing the\nturbulence is to release small neutrally buoyant markers from some fixed point in\nthe flow and watch them move downstream (Figure 2-10). The trajectories would\nbe irregularly sinuous, with angles of deviation from the downstream direction\namounting to no more than several degrees. Each trajectory would be different in\ndetail from all of the others.\n\nContinuous measurement of velocity as a function of time.\n\nT\nr\na\nj\ne\nc\nt\no\nr\ni\nes of small neutrally buoyant mark¬ers.\n\n1.4.7 The best way to see the turbulence, however, is to sprinkle the flow\nwith magic powder that allows you to see the eddies (Figure 2-11). You'd see\nrotating swirls of fluid that grade continuously into one another and that change\ntheir shape continuously with time. Individual eddies retain their identity for a\ncertain period of time (larger eddies live longer than smaller eddies) but any given\n\neddy eventually becomes unrecognizable and is replaced with newly developed\nswirls. The flowing surface of a river carrying fine sediment in suspension shows\neddies moving up to the water surface to spread out and flatten themselves.\n\nS\np\nr\ni\nn\nk\nl\ne\n\nt\nh\ne\n\nf\nl\now with magic powder.\n\n1.4.8 The maximum vertical scale of eddies in the flow is not much smaller\nthan the depth of the flow, and the maximum cross-flow scale is even larger.\nThere's a continuous range of sizes down to very small eddies, of the order of\nfractions of a millimeter. The smaller eddies are superimposed on the larger ed-\ndies. As the large eddies sweep along the boundary they cause periods of stronger\nflow and weaker flow. When you're standing on a broad plain or on the deck of a\nship at sea, the wind gusts you feel are a manifestation of these large eddies\naffecting the flow boundary. Have you ever watched a broad field of tall grass or\ngrain in a strong wind from a point high above? You'd see a striking pattern of\nwind gusts moving along in the direction of the wind as they sway the grass.\n1.4.9 Here's an interesting but incidental aspect of turbulence in a channel\nflow. In terms of the kinetic energy of the flow, the total kinetic energy is held\npartly in the mean flow and partly in the turbulent eddies that are superimposed on\nthat mean flow. As the large eddies keep forming from the mean flow, they take\nsome of the kinetic energy of the mean flow with them. The natural tendency is\nfor the bigger eddies to subdivide themselves into smaller eddies--have you ever\nseen it work the other way around?--so the kinetic energy of the turbulence is\ninevitably passed down to smaller and smaller eddy scales, finally to be dissipated\ninto heat mainly at the smallest eddy scales, where (it turns out) the local shearing\nis strongest. This is picturesquely called the energy cascade. (In case you're\nwondering how the mean flow replenishes its mechanical energy, it gets it from\nthe loss of potential energy as the fluid moves downslope.)\n\n1.4.10 Returning now to the important qualitative difference between lami-\nnar and turbulent velocity distributions, in turbulent flow the velocity distribution\nis much more uniform over most of the thickness of the flow, but changes much\nmore sharply very close to the boundary. It's easy to understand why this is so. In\nturbulent flow, over most of the flow depth the lateral motions of eddies tend to\neven out the differences in time-average velocity from layer to layer. This is\nessentially a matter of diffusion of fluid momentum. (Diffusion, remember, is the\nflux of some property by random motions in the present of a gradient in the mean\nvalue of that property.) As we move closer and closer to the boundary, however,\nthe fluid motions perpendicular to the boundary are more and more restricted--\nbecause remember that right at the boundary the fluid velocity must match that of\nthe boundary, so there can be no component of velocity normal to the boundary\nthere. In a thin layer next to the boundary, therefore, the turbulence can't even out\nthe differences in velocity from layer to layer, so the gradient of velocity is very\nsteep. This layer next to the boundary, where viscous shearing is more important\nthan turbulence, could be called the viscosity-dominated layer (Figure 2-12). Its\nthickness is typically a very small percentage of the flow depth, no more than\nmillimeters to at most a few centimeters.\n\nV\ni\ns\nc\no\ns\ni\nt\ny\n-\ndominated layer.\n\n1.4.11 But there's more to this matter than meets the eye. The above is a\ngood picture when the roughness elements on the bed (sediment particles and/or\nbed forms) are small enough to be embedded within this viscosity-dominated\nlayer. This is called dynamically smooth flow--even though the boundary may\nbe physically rough (Figure 2-13A). But in many cases the roughness elements\nare taller than what the thickness of the viscosity-dominated layer would be if\nthere were a continuous viscosity-dominated layer in the first place. You'll have\nto bear with that rather complicated verbal construction, because we're dealing\nnow with a situation in which the roughness elements stick up into the turbulent\npart of the flow and there's no longer an overall, continuous viscosity-dominated\nlayer. But keep in mind that there's still a local viscosity-dominated layer, or even\njust a film, at the surfaces of all the roughness elements themselves. This is called\ndynamically rough flow (Figure 2-13B).\n\nD\ny\nn\na\nm\ni\nc\na\nl\nl\ny\n\ns\nm\no\no\nt\nh\n\nf\nl\no\nw\n\nand rough flow.\n\n1.5 Oscillatory Flows\n\n1.5.1 Everything in the preceding sections is relevant to unidirectional flow:\na current that moves in one direction only, with velocity either unchanging with\ntime (steady flow) or changing somehow with time (unsteady flow). Also\nimportant in the transport of sediments is oscillatory flow: a current that reverses\nits direction periodically with time. The approach in this section will be somewhat\ndifferent from the approach in the preceding sections: we'll concentrate more on\nthe origin and description of oscillatory flows than on their dynamics.\n1.5.2 Except for reversing tidal currents, which technically are oscillatory\nflows with very long oscillation periods but which are better considered as re-\nversing unidirectional flows, almost all of the important oscillatory flows in nature\nare caused by surface gravity waves which propagate on the surfaces of oceans\nand large lakes. Such waves are called surface waves because they're associated\nwith the water surface, and they're called gravity waves because the dominant\nforce involved in their propagation (the force which attempts to restore the\ndeformed water surface to a planar condition) is the force of gravity.\n\n1.5.3 The generation of wind waves is a complex process, even now not\nfully understood, that involves both the shear stress of the moving air on the water\nsurface and on the unequal distribution of air pressure over the windward and\nleeward sides of geometrical irregularities on the water surface. We'll note here\nonly that the size of the waves depends on three factors: the speed of the wind, the\nduration of time the wind acts on the water surface, and the downwind distance\n(called the fetch) over which the wind acts on the water surface.\n1.5.4 The best way to obtain an idea of the basic nature of the water motions\nproduced by surface gravity waves is to watch the propagation of a single train of\nwaves in a wave tank (Figure 2-14). You can imagine building a long tank with\nrectangular cross section, perhaps several meters long, open at the top. Put a wave\ngenerator at one end. A board hinged to the bottom of the tank can be rocked or\noscillated back and forth to produce a train of waves. It's best to install some\nporous material at the other end of the tank to absorb the waves, so that they're not\nreflected to interfere with the propagating wave train.\n\nW\na\nv\ne\ns\n\ni\nn\n\na\n\nw\na\nve tank.\n\n1.5.5 Here are some terms used to describe the waves in a simple train of\nwaves (Figure 2-15). The crest of the wave is the highest point on the wave\nprofile, and the trough is the lowest point on the wave profile. The period of the\nwave is the time needed for one complete wave form to pass a point which is fixed\nrelative to the bottom of the tank. Surface gravity waves in natural environments\nhave periods that range from less than a second to almost 20 s. The wavelength of\nthe waves is the distance from crest to crest or from trough to trough. The height\nof the waves is the vertical distance from trough to crest. The heights of large\nwaves generated by major storms are commonly in the range of five to ten meters,\nbut they can be even larger.\n\nT\ne\nr\nm\ns\nabout waves.\n\n1.5.6 If you place a floating cork on the water surface and watch its motion\nthrough the wall of the tank as the waves pass by, you see that the cork travels in\nan almost perfectly circular orbit, making one circle during the passage of each\nwave (Figure 2-16). The sense of motion is such that the cork moves in the di-\nrection of wave propagation while the crest of the wave is passing, and opposite to\nthe direction of wave propagation while the trough of the wave is passing.\n\nT\nh\ne\n\nc\ni\nr\ncular orbit of a surface particle.\n\n1.5.7 The water below the surface also moves as the waves pass, but the size\nof the orbits of the water particles decreases very rapidly with depth below the\nsurface (Figure 2-17). The size of the orbits at a depth equal to half a wavelength\nis only about ten percent of the size of the orbits at the surface, and the size of the\norbits at a depth equal to one full wavelength is negligible. Such waves are called\ndeep-water waves. If the wavelength of the waves is much greater than the water\ndepth, however, the size of the orbits is still appreciable at the bottom (Figure\n2-18). Such waves are called shallow-water waves, and they are common during\nstorms. Downward from the surface the orbits become flattened into ellipses with\ngreater and greater eccentricity, until at the very bottom the orbits are back-and-\nforth straight lines. This should make sense to you, because at the bottom there\ncan be no fluid motion perpendicular to the bottom--if the slight flow into and out\nof the porous sediment is ignored.\n\nR\ne\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn between orbit diameter and depth under deep-water wave.\n\nR\ne\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nbetween orbit diameter and depth under shallow-water wave.\n\n1.5.8 Now examine more closely the nature of the oscillatory water motion\nat the bottom. If you measured the fluid velocity near the bottom as a function of\ntime at a point which is fixed relative to the bottom, you'd obtain a record which\nlooks like the graph in Figure 2-19: the velocity varies sinusoidally with time.\nThe nature of the motion can be characterized by its period T, or by the maximum\nvelocity Um which is attained during one oscillation cycle (this happens when the\nwater is at the central point of its oscillation path) or by the distance do moved by\na water particle during one full oscillation (this is called the orbital diameter).\nOnly one of the latter two quantities is independent, however, because the period,\nthe maximum velocity, and the orbital diameter are related by the equation\nUmT =πdo. This relation is easy to derive, but we won't do that here.\n\nF\nl\nu\ni\nd\n\nv\ne\nl\nocity as a function of time.\n\n1.5.9 It's part of the physical nature of waves that different trains of surface\ngravity waves can be superimposed on each other in such a way that the water-\nsurface height and water motion at a given point is the sum of contributions from\neach superimposed wave train. You might know from watching storms at sea or\non large lakes that the sea state produced by a strong wind is complicated, because\nit's a superposition of a large number of separate trains of waves with slightly\ndifferent periods, propagation directions, and heights. Also, when the wind\ndirection changes as a storm passes, the waves adjust their direction of\npropagation in response. In such cases, the pattern of water movement at the\nbottom is no longer a simple back-and-forth movement. Even the relatively\nsimple case of two regular trains of waves moving in different directions, the\nbottom water movement can be surprisingly complicated, to say nothing of the\nreally complicated wave conditions produced during storms.\n\n1.6 The Wind\n\n1.6.1 The large-scale structure of the lower part of the atmosphere is obvi-\nously much different from that of even the largest river. The most obvious dif-\nference is the absence of a free surface in the atmosphere. An equally important\ndifference has to do with the much larger scale of wind systems. This is impor-\ntant because the Earth's rotation plays a dominant role in determining wind di-\nrection but is a minor aspect of even the largest of rivers. A third important dif-\nference is related to the easy compressibility of air, in contrast to the incompress-\nibility of water. This means that the thermodynamics of compressibility plays an\nenormous role in the behavior of the atmosphere.\n1.6.2 Despite these far-reaching differences, it's fortunate for us as\nEarthbound sedimentologists that the structure of the wind in the near-surface\nlayer, up to hundreds or even a few thousands of meters above the surface, is\nusually not greatly different from that of large-scale channel flows, in terms of\nsuch things as velocity distribution, turbulence structure, and boundary forces.\nMost of what we said in Section 1.4 above for channel flows of water is largely\napplicable to the wind. This is especially true of eolian sand transport and the\nshaping of sand dunes--certainly the most important aspect of eolian sedimentary\nprocesses for this course.\n1.6.3 You might complain that the wind is so much more gusty than the or-\ndinarily turbulent flow of rivers. We would counter that by saying that your con-\nception of the gustiness of the wind is shaped by observations made for the most\npart down in among large and very irregularly shaped and irregularly distributed\nroughness elements like trees, hills, and buildings. To the extent things like that\noccupy river bottoms (hills are certainly there, and we'll have to deal with them as\na really important part of this course), and you sensed turbulence down at their\nlevel, flow in rivers would seem pretty \"gusty\" too. (There'll be more on that\nlater, when we talk about flow over subaqueous bed forms.) If you've ever\nexperienced a strong wind at sea, you know that the wind unimpeded by large\nroughness elements is surprisingly steady.\n\n2. BASICS OF SEDIMENT TRANSPORT\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\n2.1.1 It seems crazy to us to start dealing with physical sedimentary struc-\ntures before presenting some material on how sediment is transported and de-\nposited in the first place, so we've included this second background chapter. It's\nentirely qualitative but deals with what we think are the important topics: forces\non sediment particles resting on a sediment bed: the threshold of particle move-\nment; the nature of the sediment load; and just a bit on transport rates and mixed-\nsize sediments.\n\n2.2 Forces on Particles\n\n2.2.1 You saw in Chapter 2 that a fluid flow exerts forces on its solid\nboundary. In particular, the flow exerts forces on all of the sediment grains ex-\nposed at the surface of a loose sediment bed. If the force exerted by the flow on a\ngiven sediment particle is momentarily great enough, the particle is set into\nmotion. This section presents a brief discussion of the nature of fluid forces on\nsediment particles resting on the sediment bed.\n\n2.2.2 Look at the flow around an isolated hemisphere on an otherwise planar\nboundary (Figure 2-20). This is a simplified but qualitatively representative\nmodel for the more complicated forces on particles of irregular shape resting on a\nbed of similar particles.\n\nF\nl\no\nw\n\na\nround a hemisphere on a planar boundary.\n\n2.2.3 The forces acting on the smooth surface of the hemisphere are of two kinds,\nviscous forces and pressure forces. Viscous forces are exerted tangential to the\nsolid surface. They are present because the fluid is undergoing shear next to the\nsolid surface (Figure 2-21A). Remember that whenever a fluid is sheared, a\nviscous resistance force is present. Pressure forces are easier to understand.\nFluids exert pressure within themselves and also on all solid boundaries. On the\nsolid boundaries the fluid pressure is manifested as a force per unit area acting\nperpendicular to the boundary (Figure 2-21B).\n\nV\ni\ns\nc\no\nu\ns\n\nf\no\nr\nc\ne\ns\n\na\nn\nd pressure forces.\n\n2.2.4 Both the viscous forces and the pressure forces vary from point to\npoint all over the surface of the hemisphere in Figure 2-20. To find the total force\nor resultant force exerted by the fluid on the hemisphere, you need to sum or\nintegrate both kinds of forces over the surface of the hemisphere. Although this is\neasy to do in one's imagination, in practice it's difficult even for very large\nhemispheres, and it's impossible for tiny sediment particles.\n\n2.2.5 The nature of the forces on a bed particle depends very strongly on the\nheight of the hemisphere relative to the thickness of the viscosity-dominated layer.\nIf the height of the hemisphere is much smaller than the thickness of the viscous\nsublayer (Figure 2-22A), the flow around the particle is only weakly turbulent, and\nthe forces exerted by the flow are approximately the same as in laminar flow. If\nthe height of the hemisphere is much greater than the thickness of the viscous\nsublayer (Figure 2-22B), the flow around the hemisphere is strongly turbulent, and\nalso the flow pattern is greatly different.\n\nP\na\nt\nt\ne\nr\nn\n\no\nf\n\nf\nlow around a bottom sediment particle.\n\n2.2.6 Figure 2-23 is a cartoon showing the flow and forces around the hemi-\nsphere when it's embedded in the viscous sublayer. The flow pattern shows\nstreamlines diverging smoothly in front of the hemisphere, converging at the\nmidsection, and diverging again behind the hemisphere. Turbulence in the flow is\nweak, and the presence of the hemisphere itself does not create any new turbu-\nlence. The fluid pressure is relatively high on the front of the hemisphere and\nrelatively low on the back, resulting in a net downstream pressure force. It turns\nout that the viscous forces and the pressure forces are of about the same magni-\ntude.\n\nF\nl\no\nw\n\na\nn\nd\n\nf\no\nr\nc\ne\ns in viscosity-dominated layer.\n\n2.2.7 Figure 2-24 is the corresponding cartoon showing the flow and forces\naround the hemisphere when it protrudes high above the viscous sublayer. The\n\nstreamlines diverge smoothly in front of the hemisphere, but instead of converging\nagain they separate from the surface of the hemisphere at the midsection and\nshoot off into the flow, leaving a region of stagnant fluid behind the hemisphere.\nThis phenomenon is called flow separation. Flow separation is inevitable around\nblunt bodies when the flow is fast and the body is large. Flow separation is\ncharacteristic of buildings in the wind and trucks on the road, as well as of bed\nforms and large sediment particles. The pressure in the stagnant fluid behind the\nhemisphere is very low everywhere, so the resultant pressure force on the hemi-\nsphere is very large, much larger than the viscous force.\n\nFlow and forces above viscous sublayer.\n\n2.2.8 Note in Figures 2-23 and 2-24 that because the pressure is relatively\nlow at the top of the hemisphere and relatively high around its base, there's a lift\ncomponent to the resultant force. This is exactly the same kind of lift force that\nacts on airplane wings. The lift force can be almost equal to the downstream\ncomponent of the resultant force (which is called the drag).\n2.2.9 Let us remind you that the forces on the hemisphere would vary\nsharply with time, because of the passage of larger eddies near the boundary.\nForces can vary by factors of four or even more with time. The time scales for\nchange in forces on a sediment particle can be very short, fractions of a second.\n\n2.3 Threshold of Movement\n\n2.3.1 One of the classic problems in sediment transport is that of the thresh-\nold of movement, or incipient movement: how strong a flow is needed to set the\nparticles of a given sediment bed in motion? This problem is obviously important\nfor engineering purposes. An equivalent problem, which is more relevant to\ngeology, is that of competence: how coarse a sediment can be moved by a given\nflow?\n2.3.2 The problem of incipient movement should be one of the simplest in\nsediment transport mechanics, because the sediment hasn't yet started to move, so\nthe structure of turbulence and the pattern of fluid forces are not complicated by\nthe presence of moving grains. Actually the problem turns out to be mostly in-\ntractable theoretically, and both engineers and sedimentologists have relied upon\nempirical approaches.\n2.3.3 Our common sense tells us that stronger flows are needed to move\ncoarser sediment. In this case, our common sense is correct! (That's not always\ntrue, especially in sediment transport mechanics.) But to know just how strong a\nflow is needed to move a given sediment, observation and experiment are needed.\n2.3.4 Obviously the sorting and particle shape are important, because the\ndetails of the fluid forces on the particles depend both on the particle shape and on\nhow the uppermost particles rest upon the underlying particles. In dealing with\nthe movement threshold, it's usually assumed that the sediment is naturally well\nsorted, and equant and subrounded in shape. Not much work has been done on the\neffect of sorting and shape on the threshold of movement.\n2.3.5 The threshold conditions should depend on independent variables that\ndescribe the flow, the fluid, and the sediment. Either the bed shear stress or the\nflow velocity could be used to describe the flow. The trouble with using the ve-\nlocity is that it's not clear which velocity to use: the velocity at the level of the\ntops of the particles, which is impossible to measure or estimate, or some other\nvelocity like the mean velocity of flow. The problem with using the mean velocity\nis that then the flow depth must also be considered, because many combinations of\nflow depth and flow velocity are equivalent to a given boundary shear stress. But\nit's easier for us to attach concrete significance to the flow velocity than to the bed\nshear stress.\n\n2.3.6 The best way to approach the problem of initiation of motion empiri-\ncally is to decide which are the most important variables that govern whether\nparticles are moved or not by the flow and then plot a graph that separates condi-\ntions of no movement from conditions of movement (by a curve in a two-dimen-\nsional graph or a surface in a three-dimensional graph).\n\n2.3.7 In the general problem, lots of variables might be important: the\ndensity ρ and the viscosity μ of the fluid, the diameter D of the sediment particles\n(to say nothing of sorting and particle shape), and the strength of the flow, best\ncharacterized by the bed shear stress τo. But for flows of water-density fluid over\nquartz density sediment (and let's assume that sorting and shape are of secondary\nimportance, which is probably true for \"ordinary\" sediments), then only D and τo\n\nvary. So we can get away nicely with a two-dimensional graph of boundary shear\nstress against sediment size. The curve that separates movement and no\nmovement is called the threshold curve.\n\n2.3.8 If you read the literature on sediment movement you're likely to see\nmention of the Shields diagram, which is a similar graph but arranged in a special\ndimensionless form that's applicable (in theory!) to all combinations of fluids and\nsediments. What we're doing here is a shortcut but essentially the same thing.\n\n2.3.9 Figure 2-25 shows the threshold curve for quartz sediment in water.\nThere's still the problem of concretely visualizing the boundary shear stress. Mean\nflow velocity would be much better for that, but then the problem is that there's a\nslightly different curve for each flow depth, because there's a whole range of\ncombinations of flow depth and flow velocity that five the same boundary shear\nstress. Figure 2-26 shows three threshold curves for quartz in water in a graph of\nmean flow velocity against sediment size, for flow depths of 0.1 m, 1 m, and 10 m.\nFigure 2-26 should give you a concrete idea of threshold conditions in water\nflows.\n\nT\nh\nr\ne\ns\nh\no\nl\nd\n\nc\nu\nr\nv\ne\nfor quartz sediment in water.\n\n2.3.10 The data that have been used to find the curves in Figures 2-25 and\n2-26 show quite a lot of scatter. This is mainly because the range of flow\nconditions for which there is slight sediment movement is very wide. In other\nwords, it's difficult to define the threshold of movement. You could observe this\nfor yourself by preparing a planar sediment bed in a laboratory channel and then\npassing a flow of water over it. As you gradually increase the flow strength,\n\neventually there's slight grain movement, in the form of pulses or gusts at random\npoints on the bed where one or more grains are moved by a locally strong eddy.\nAs you continue to increase the flow strength, the frequency of the pulses or gusts\nincreases, and the number of grains moved by each pulse or gust increases as well.\nEventually there's abundant grain movement.\n\nT\nh\nr\ne\ne\n\nt\nh\nr\ne\ns\nh\no\nl\nd\n\ncurves for quartz in water.\n\n2.3.11 One big problem with all of this development is that it applies only to\nincipient movement on a perfectly planar preexisting sediment surface. When was\nthe last time you saw a perfectly planar sediment surface in nature? (They do\nexist, but they're certainly not common.) Sediment movement on bed forms starts\nat much lower flow strengths, just because the flow is concentrated at the crests of\nthe bed forms.\n2.3.12 Incipient movement is thus probabilistic or stochastic. A good way\nof thinking about this is in terms of the relationship between two different prob-\nability distributions (Figure 2-27): the distribution of instantaneous local bed\nshear stress needed to move the set of particles in some area of the bed, and the\ndistribution of local bed shear stress which acts on any small area of the bed\nthrough time. When the two distributions don't overlap, the flow is never strong\nenough to move any of the grains (Figure 2-27A). When the two distributions\noverlap slightly, a small subset of the bed particles are moved by the flow (Figure\n2-27B). With increasing flow strength the distributions eventually overlap en-\ntirely, and all the bed particles are susceptible to movement (Figure 2-27C).\n\nT\nh\nr\ne\ns\nh\no\nl\nd\n\nc\no\nn\nd\ni\nt\nion.\n\n2.4 The Sediment Load\n\n2.4.1 Classification of the Sediment Load\n\n2.4.1.1 The aggregate of sediment particles that are transported by a flow at\na given time is called the load. The load can further be subdivided in two different\nways. On the one hand, the load can be divided into bed-material load, which is\nthat part of the load whose sizes are represented in the bed in nonnegligible\npercentages, and wash load, which is that part of the load whose sizes are not\npresent in the bed in appreciable percentages. The wash load, which is always\nthe finest fraction of the load, is carried through a long segment of the flow\nwithout any exchange of sediment between the bed and the flow.\n2.4.1.2 On the other hand, the load can also be divided into bed load, which\ntravels in direct contact with the bed or so close to the bed as not to be substan-\ntially affected by the fluid turbulence, and suspended load, which is maintained in\ntemporary suspension above the bed by the action of upwardly moving turbulent\neddies (Figure 2-28). We hope it's clear from these definitions that bed load is\nalways bed-material load, and suspended load is likely to be partly bed-material\nload and partly wash load, although in particular cases it could be all wash load,\nor all bed-material load. This may sound confusing, but it makes sense. Figure\n2-29 may or may not be of help.\n\nR\ne\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\nh\ni\np\n\na\nm\no\nn\ng\n\nt\nh\ne different kinds of load.\n\n2.4.1.3 Keep in mind that the set of particles that form the load keeps\nchanging from time to time, because particles are continually\ncoming to rest and being set into motion again. The best way to\nmake the distinction between the bed and the load is to consider that\na particle in motion is part of the load, even if it is still in contact\nwith the bed (Figure 2-30). When a particle starts to move, it stops\nbeing a bed particle and starts being part of the load. Conversely,\nwhen it comes to rest again it tops being part of the load and\nbecomes a bed particle again.\n\nB\ne\nd\n\np\na\nr\nt\ni\nc\nl\ne\ns and load particles.\n\n2 .4.2 Bed Load\n2.4.2.1 The movement of bed load is sometimes called traction. Bed-load\nmovement can be by rolling, sliding, or hopping (Figure 2-31). It's not easy to\nobserve bed-load movement in great detail, but when you have the chance to\nwatch a carefully made high-speed closeup motion picture of bed load (in flows\nwhere the load is not yet so abundant as to obscure the view) you see that the\nparticles characteristically take occasional excursions downstream, by rolling and\nhopping irregularly with brief stops along the way, and then come to rest for some\ntime before being moved again. The explanation is apparently that once a grain is\ndislodged from a place of rest it's susceptible to continued movement by the flow\nuntil it finally finds a rather sheltered position, and then it's not dislodged again\nuntil it's affected by an especially strong shear stress or until one or more of the\nbed particles sheltering it are themselves put into motion.\n\nM\no\nd\ne\ns\n\no\nf\n\nb\ne\nd\n-\nload movement.\n\n2.4.2.2\nThe problem in discussing bed load is that we know very little\nabout the characteristic modes of bed-load movement except in\nweak flows in which not much sediment is moving. This is an\narea in which there has been much speculation supported by\nvery little observational data. And yet such conditions are very\nimportant sedimentologically. One popular theory, which is\nintuitively attractive, is that when there's a high concentration\nof moving bed-load particles, the particles farther away from\nthe bed are maintained partly or largely in their motion by\ncollisions with particles moving closer to the bed (Figure 2-32).\nThis involves a kind of dispersive effect, and the dispersion of\ngrains maintained above the bed in this way has been called a\ntraction carpet. Unfortunately the importance of this\ndispersive effect is still not known.\n\nDispersive effect in bed-load movement.\n\n2 .4.3 Suspended Load\n2.4.3.1 There's clearly a problem in distinguishing between bed load and\nsuspended load: how far can a grain move up into the flow and still be considered\nbed load? The standard criterion is whether or not fluid turbulence has a sub-\nstantial effect on the time and distance involved in the excursion. Although the\ndistinction between bed load and suspended load is a convenient one, there's no\nsharp break between bed load and suspended load.\n2.4.3.2 Keep in mind also that a given particle can be part of the bed load at\none moment and part of the suspended load at another moment, depending upon\nthe time history of fluid forces and motions to which it is subjected. (And of\ncourse at still other times the same particle might not be moving at all.) Therefore,\nat any given time there's an appreciable overlap in the size distributions of the bed\nload and the suspended load, although clearly the suspended load tends always to\nbe finer on the average than the bed load.\n2.4.3.3 Particles moving as bed load are susceptible to being carried up into\nsuspension when the maximum vertical turbulent velocity fluctuations are greater\nin magnitude than the settling velocities of the particles. If the conditions of the\nflow and the settling velocities of the particles fulfill that condition, then some of\n\nthe moving bed-load particles will occasionally find themselves caught in a strong\nupward-moving eddy, and the particle will be carried for some distance above the\nbed. The particle will be affected by a series of eddies as it moves downstream;\ndepending on the motions of the individual eddies, the particle may rise only a\nshort distance from the bed and travel only a short distance downstream before it\nsettles back to the bed, or it may rise high above the bed, even almost to the water\nsurface, and travel far downstream. Obviously, the smaller the settling velocity\nand the stronger the turbulence, the greater the average height above the bed and\nthe greater the distance of travel downstream the particle will attain.\n2.4.3.4 The sediment particles are not really suspended above the bed, in the\nway that a painting is suspended on a nail in the wall: they are always settling\nback toward the bed and will eventually return to the bed. Only particles of col-\nloidal size, much finer than a micrometer, can be truly suspended. Such particles\nhave such small mass that Brownian motions caused by the random collisions of\nmolecules against the particle keep the particle in permanent suspension.\n2.4.3.5 The controls on the vertical distribution of suspended sediment in\nsteady and uniform flows are well understood. The basic idea is that if one con-\nsiders a small horizontal unit area somewhere in the flow, there must be a time-\naverage balance between the rate at which sediment settles down through that unit\narea and the rate at which sediment is transported up through the unit area by\nturbulent diffusion (Figure 2-33). (The idea behind turbulent diffusion is that\nbecause there is an upward decrease in suspended sediment concentration, the\nrandom motions of eddies across the unit area result in a net upward movement of\nsuspended sediment even though the volumes of fluid exchanged cross the unit\narea are the same.)\n\nV\ne\nr\nt\ni\nc\na\nl\n\nb\na\nl\na\nn\nce.\n\n2.4.3.6 Prediction of the vertical distribution of suspended load in a steady\nuniform channel flow on the basis of the foregoing idea is one of the few theoret-\nical successes in the mechanics of sediment transport. The theory predicts an ex-\nponential decrease in suspended-sediment concentration with height above the\nbed. When the vertical turbulent velocities are only slightly greater than the\nsettling velocities of the particles, the suspended-sediment concentration is not\nvery great even near the bed and drops rapidly to essentially zero a short distance\nabove the bed (Figure 2-34A). When the turbulent velocities are much greater\nthan the settling velocities of the particles, however, the suspended-sediment\nconcentration near the bed is high and falls off only slightly with height above the\nbed (Figure 2-34B). Laboratory measurements of vertical profiles of suspended\nsediment match the theoretical predictions very well.\n\nC\nu\nr\nv\ne\ns\n\no\nf\n\ns\nu\ns\np\ne\nn\nded-sediment concentration.\n\n2.4.3.7 The theory is only a qualified success, however, because the it pro-\nvides only the distribution relative to some assumed reference concentration at\nsome reference elevation above the bed. You can think of the bed-load layer as\nforming the bottom boundary condition for the suspended-sediment distribution.\nThe key element--how the flow establishes the reference suspended-sediment\nconcentration just outside the bed-load layer--is still not well known.\n2.4.3.8 Although no measurements have been made, it seems reasonable to\nsuppose that in most sediment-transporting flow systems, like rivers or storm-\ndriven currents in the shallow ocean, most of the sediment transported past a\ngiven cross section of the flow over a long period of time is in suspension. Even\nthough bed-load transport may be occurring most of the time, the total volume\n\nmoved as bed load is relatively small. On the other hand, the imprint or signature\nof bed-load transport on the sedimentary record is very great.\n\n2 .4.4 Saltation\n2.4.4.1 All the material discussed so far in this section on the sediment load\nis relevant to the transport of sediment in water. The picture for transport of\nsediment by wind is rather different. The reason is that the ratio of sediment\ndensity to fluid density is far greater in air than in water, so the sediment grains\nhave great relative inertia and can travel through the air without their trajectories\nbeing much affected by the local fluid turbulence.\n2.4.4.2 The characteristic mode of sediment movement in air is saltation.\nSaltation is a mode of particle movement in which particles are launched from the\nbed at moderate to steep angles, follow a regular arching trajectory, and descend\nback to the bed at small angles. Figure 2-35 shows a typical saltation trajectory\ntaken by a saltating grain of sand in air. Because of the great relative density of\nthe sediment particles, saltation trajectories are rather regular, and show little of\nthe sinuosity that might be expected from passage through turbulent eddies.\n\nA\n\nt\ny\np\ni\nc\na\nl\n\ns\naltation tra¬jectory in air.\n2.4.4.3 Saltation is the dominant mode of particle movement when a strong\nwind blows over a sand surface. Except in the very strongest winds, the saltation\nheights attained by the saltating grains seldom exceeds a meter, and the saltation\nlengths are mostly less than a few meters. There is, of course, a continuous dis-\ntribution of jump heights and jump lengths, from zero to the maximum. There's\nalso wide variability in take-off angles: they range from just a few tens of degrees\nto vertical. After colliding with some particularly immovable bed grain, a\nsaltating grain can even take off with an upstream component to its motion.\n2.4.4.4 If you're lucky enough to be out on a dry sand surface during a strong\nwind, take the risk of getting some sand in your eyes and nose and mouth, and get\ndown on the sand surface for a horizontal view at an eye level of a few tens of\ncentimeters above the surface (Figure 2-36). You'd see a hazy layer of saltating\n\ngrains, which tails off imperceptibly upward. If you then looked downward at the\nsand surface, you'd see an abundance of surface grains being pushed along for\nshort distances, just one or a few grain diameters at a time, presumably by being\nstruck by saltating grains. That mode of movement is called surface creep--but\nkeep in mind that there's really no sharp break between surface creep and saltation.\n\nO\nb\ns\ne\nr\nv\ni\nn\ng\n\na\n\nsand sur¬face in a windstorm.\n\n2.4.4.5 Many aspects of saltation are not well understood. Among these is\nthe mechanism that causes the initial rise of the grains. Two different effects\ncome to mind: lift forces, as was discussed in an earlier section, and the geometry\nof collisions between already saltating grains and stationary grains on the bed.\nAnother problem is that of the importance of saltation in water. Several\nresearchers have described trajectories of sand grains moving in trajectories close\nto the bed in water flows as a kind of saltation. Such trajectories are not much like\nthe characteristic saltation trajectories of dense grains in air, and whether what is\ndescribed as saltation in water is related to true saltation in air is an unresolved\nquestion.\n2.4.4.6 An interesting feature of saltation is the rotation rates of the saltating\nparticles. Ultra-high-speed motion pictures have revealed strikingly high spin\nrates of hundreds of revolutions per second! The sense of spin is such that that the\ntop of the particle moves faster in the downstream direction than the bottom of the\nparticle (Figure 2-37). The origin of such high rates of spin is still a mystery.\n\nS\np\ni\nn\n\na\n\np\na\nr\nt\ni\nc\nle saltating in air.\n\n2.5 Transport Rates\n\n2.5.1 The rate at which sediment is moved past a cross section of the flow,\ncalled either the sediment transport rate or the sediment discharge, usually\ndenoted by Qs, is one of the most important concepts on sediment transport\nmechanics. The sediment transport rate can be measured in mass per unit time, or\nin weight per unit time, or in volume per unit time. Often the sediment transport\nrate is considered per unit width of flow; then it's called the unit sediment\ntransport rate, and is usually written qs.\n2.5.2 The concept of sediment transport rate is most naturally applied to\nunidirectional flows, but even the most nearly symmetrical oscillatory flows usu-\nally have at least slight net transport in one direction or another; this latter trans-\nport is the difference between the transport in one direction and the transport in the\nopposite direction during one oscillation, averaged over a large number of\noscillations.\n2.5.3 There are two different ways of approaching the characterization of\nsediment transport rates. On the one hand, you could take a purely empirical\napproach: make a list of all the variables that should affect the transport rate, and\nthen make a dimensional analysis to provide a rational framework for handling or\norganizing measurement data. If enough good data are already at hand, you'd then\nhave some predictive capability.\n2.5.4 What's usually done, however, is something different: think about the\nphysics of sediment transport in a way that allows you to develop the form of\nsome rational equation for transport rates, which contains within it one or more\n\"adjustable parameters\" whose values are assigned by analysis of selected data sets\nalready at hand.\n2.5.5 Our common sense tells us, correctly again, that the stronger the flow\nthe greater the sediment transport rate. And an important first-order fact of ob-\nservation is that the sediment transport rate is a very steeply increasing function of\nthe flow strength. Perhaps the simplest approach to quantifying qs is to write an\nexpression like\n\nqs = Aτon\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere A is a coefficient and n is an exponent much larger than one. Better yet, τo\nmight be replaced with τo - τoc, where τoc is the threshold boundary shear stress\nfor sediment movement. Such an approach has no particular physical basis, but\nwith A and n adjusted by use of observational data, Equation (2.1) can serve for\nvery crude estimates of qs. But the trouble with Equation (2.1) is that it has no\nstrong physical basis. The true situation must be much more complicated than\nEquation (2.1).\n2.5.6 It's almost no exaggeration to say that dozens of sediment discharge\nformulas have found their way into the hydraulic-engineering literature. And it's\nan understatement to say that the physical basis behind these formulas ranges\nwidely. You might think that the ease with which data can be fitted to such a\nformula should give an idea of the validity of the underlying assumptions about\nthe physics of sediment transport. But a skeptic might point out that an equation\nof almost any form can accommodate a given data set fairly well, so long as there\nare two or three adjustable parameters in that equation--as is usually the case with\nsediment discharge formulas. In the context of this course, there's no point in\npursuing formulas for sediment transport rate any further, despite the fact that\nthey're so important in engineering approaches to sediment transport.\n2.5.7 Measuring the sediment transport rate is a notoriously difficult task.\nIdeally one would like to be able to keep track of every single particle that passes\nacross a given cross section of the flow in some representative time interval, and\nmeasure the mass of each of those particles (somehow without disrupting the\nflow), and then divide the total mass by the time interval during which it was\nmeasured. Unfortunately there's no good way of doing that.\n2.5.8 In the laboratory it's often possible (although difficult) to arrange the\nflow so that all the sediment is extracted at some point, for example by means of a\nslot trap in the bottom of the channel. Then the catch can be weighed and put\nright back into the flow immediately. In a few cases this been done even on small\nrivers, for research purposes.\n2.5.9 Usually bed load is measured with devices called bed-load traps or\nbed-load samplers. They come in all sizes and geometries, but their purpose is to\ncatch all the bed load that comes upon the trap from upstream--without catching\ntoo much or too little. Unfortunately there are many practical problems connected\nwith bed-load traps. Suspended load is easier to measure, by taking water samples\nat a number of points along the vertical and making a numerical integration.\n\n2.6 Mixed-Size Sediments\n\n2.6.1 Until recently, almost all research work and development of theory on\nsediment transport has ignored the effect of sorting (the spread of sizes around the\nmean size). For the purposes of much engineering work, the assumption that\nsorting is unimportant has not caused great difficulties, partly because the particle\nsize itself is not an important consideration and partly because the uncertainties in\ntheory and measurement overshadow the errors arising from neglect of sorting.\nBut in sedimentology one of the most important aspects of sediment transport is\nthe tendency for fractionation or spatial segregation of different particle sizes: the\n\nparticle-size distribution of a clastic sediment, which is one of the few available\nreflections of the paleoflow environment, is in large part the outcome of\nfractionation arising from differing rates of transport of different particle sizes.\n2.6.2 Understanding of the phenomena of mixed-size sediment transport is\nstill rudimentary. Much more work needs to be done before that understanding\ncan provide a good basis for interpreting the information contained in the size\ndistributions of clastic sediments. In this section we'll only point out some of the\nimportant aspects of the problem.\n2.6.3 Let us pose an important question for you. Think carefully before\nanswering. Consider a planar bed of poorly sorted sediment, with sizes ranging\nperhaps from sand size to large pebble size. A strong current is passed over the\nsediment bed, causing bed-load transport. Think about the fractional transport\nrates--that is, the transport rates of the individual size fractions in the sediment\nmixture. The question is: if you normalize those fractional transport rates by\ndividing the transport rate of each fraction by the percentage of that fraction in the\ntotal mixture (to take into account the differing abundances of the fractions),\nwhich fractions would have the highest normalized transport rates: the finest\nsediment, the coarsest sediment, or some fraction or fractions in between?\n2.6.4 This is a situation where you have to be careful about what your intu-\nition or common sense tells you. It's easy to adduce three important effects here:\nparticle weight, exposure/shielding, and rollability. Even though the large par-\nticles are much heavier than the small particles, and therefore are more difficult to\nmove, they project much higher into the flow, and therefore the fluid forces on\nthem are much greater (Figure 2-38). But it's easy for a large particle to roll over a\nbed of smaller particles (Figure 2-39). On the other hand, the fine particles are\nmuch lighter but they tend to be sheltered from the force of the flow by the larger\nparticles. But a smaller particle has a hard time rolling up and over a bed of larger\nparticles to be set into motion.\n\nE\nx\np\no\ns\nu\nr\ne\n/\ns\nh\ni\ne\nlding effect.\n\nR\no\nl\nl\na\nb\ni\nl\ni\nt\ny\n\ne\nf\nf\nect.\n\n2.6.5 Interestingly, available laboratory data show that for bed-load trans-\nport all of these effects tend quite closely to cancel or offset one another, so that\nthe normalized transport rates of all size fractions are not greatly different.\nHowever, the small differences that do exist may be important when transport\ntakes place over long time scales and for long distances. When some of the sed-\niment is carried in suspension, it can easily outrun the fractions traveling as bed\nload, and then there can be large differences in normalized fractional transport\nrates.\n\n2.7 More Concentrated Flows\n\n2 .7.1 Dispersed-Sediment Flows and Concentrateed-Sediment Flows\n2.7.1.1 When viewed from a dynamical standpoint, there's a continuous\nspectrum of concentrations of the sediment load, from vanishingly small, in flows\nwhich are only a little stronger than the threshold condition, to extremely high.\nThe upper limit of sediment concentration is the condition that there's enough pore\nspace between the sediment particles so that the sediment-fluid mixture can be\ndeformed without the interlocking of grains preventing the deformation. Near this\nupper limit, sediment concentrations can be as much as 60% by volume.\n2.7.1.2 But from the standpoint of practical sedimentology, we've found it\nuseful to think in terms of two different ranges of sediment concentrations. On\nthe one hand, we commonly deal with deposits that were made by flows that\ncarried relatively small concentrations of sediment. Concentrations in these flows\nare usually very small, but even though the concentrations might be of the order of\nten percent, the flows can still be viewed as relatively \"thin\" and certainly fully\nturbulent. All pressure-gradient-driven marine currents, like tidal currents or\nwind-driven currents, as well as most river flows, are in this category. we'll call\nsuch flows dispersed-sediment flows. You'll see that these dispersed-sediment\nflows are responsible for distinctive kinds of deposits which show generally good\n\nstratification and evidence of tractional transport. They tend to be relatively well\nsorted.\n2.7.1.3 On the other hand, many flows that are of great sedimentological in-\nterest have sediment concentrations near the upper end of the possible range.\nConcentrated sediment gravity flows like debris flows are the main kinds of flows\nwith sediment concentrations this high, although a few rivers (like the Yellow\nRiver in China) with what's called hyperconcentrated flow also have extremely\nhigh sediment concentrations. we'll call flows of this kind concentrated-sediment\nflows. The deposits produced by these flows tend to lack clear stratification, and\nthey're usually much less well sorted than dispersed-sediment flows. Obviously\nthere are intermediate cases, not only in rivers but also in sediment gravity flows.\n2.7.1.4 These two terms are very unofficial, and you will not find them in the\nsedimentological literature. But we think they're a useful \"crutch\" for thinking\nabout the origin of clastic deposits when you're on the outcrop. When I'm looking\nat a particular bed, we usually ask ourselves whether that bed was deposited by a\ndispersed-sediment flow or a concentrated-sediment flow, or perhaps by a flow\nwith intermediate characteristics.\n2.7.1.5 To our mind, the main reason why concentrated-sediment flows are\nmore difficult to come to grips with than dispersed-sediment flows has to do with\nthe related problems of overloading and past history. Suppose you start with a\nflow of water, with a given discharge, over a sediment bed. If the flow is strong\nenough, some of the sediment will be entrained and transported, either as bed load\nor as a combination of bed load and suspended load. (If the sediment is entirely in\nthe clay to fine silt range, the flow must be so strong to even begin to erode the\nbed, and the resulting entrained sediment has such a small settling velocity, that all\nof the load might be suspended load.) But in any case an equilibrium becomes\nestablished whereby the flow transports just as much sediment as it is able to, and\nthere's a balance between entrainment and redeposition. You could look at an\nestablished flow like that and not be able to say anything about how or when it got\nstarted.\n2.7.1.6 But the range of such flows by no means exhausts all of the possible\nsediment-transporting flows. That's because it's possible for a preexisting non-\nflowing mass of sediment and water to undergo mass mobilization of some kind,\nby liquefaction, for example, and then flow as a high-concentration two-phase\nflow with a concentration much higher than could have become established by\nstarting with a clear-water flow over a bed of the same sediment. A flow like this\nhas an important aspect of past history. And it's likely to be overloaded--\nalthough, depending upon the particular conditions of flow, it may be self-sus-\ntaining until it eventually reaches a gentler slope down which to flow. Of course,\nany flow, not just mass flows of this kind, will deposit its sediment as it becomes\noverloaded by decelerating. It's just that the degree of overloading, or the rate at\nwhich the flow loses sediment as it decelerates, is typically much greater and more\nspectacular with concentrated-sediment flows than with dispersed-sediment flows.\n\n2 .7.2 Classification and Discussion of Concentrated-Sediment Flows\n2.7.2.1 At the risk of oversimplifying complex phenomena, here's a very\ncrude and very generalized classification of concentrated-sediment flows (Table\n2-1). The orientation here is practical rather than theoretical.\n\nC\nr\nu\nde and generalized classification of concentrated-sediment flows.\n\nslumps/slides: large masses of solid material move downslope under the pull\nof gravity; presence of interstitial fluid may be important but is not essential\nfor the existence of the flow; not usually viewed as \"sediment transport\".\nVertical mixing ranges from slight to substantial; deposition is probably\nusually sudden, by \"freezing\" of the moving mass.\ndebris flows: highly concentrated mixtures of sediment and water with little\nor no differentiation that flow as thick two-phase fluids; little or no vertical\ndifferentiation in the flowing mass; vertical mixing is usually substantial;\nnonturbulent to turbulent; deposition ranges from sudden to incremental.\nhyperconcentrated flows: moderately concentrated mixtures of sediment and\nwater, with little to perhaps moderate differentiation; vertical mixing is\nsubstantial; weakly to strongly turbulent; deposition is incremental.\nturbidity currents: slightly to moderately concentrated mixtures of sediment\nand water; moderate to great vertical differentiation in the flowing mass;\nvertical mixing substantial; moderately to strongly turbulent; deposition\nincremental.\ngrain flows: downslope flows of solid particles under gravity; importance of\ninterstitial fluid negligible to slight; deposition ranges from sudden to in-\ncremental.\n2.7.2.2 With the exception of the last item, grain flows, the foregoing list is\napproximately in order of decreasing solids concentration, increasing turbulence\nand mixing, and a shift from sudden to incremental deposition. We emphasize\nthat there is great variability within each of the categories, and certainly\ngradations in both physics and features among categories. In a way, grain flows\nare like slumps/slides (or should we make that vice versa?), but in scale and origin\nthey seem to us rather different.\n2.7.2.3 Debris flows and turbidity currents are of undoubtedly great sedi-\nmentological importance. The importance of hyperconcentrated flows is less clear\nbut is certainly nonnegligible, and maybe much greater than most workers suspect.\nIn regard to grain flows, the only grain flows we've ever been convinced are\nsedimentologically important are on very small and very local scales, mainly those\nthat transport sand down the lee faces of dunes in both subaerial and subaqueous\nenvironments."

      "content": "(even more common, but not apparent to the casual observer) in large rivers and\nthe shallow ocean--all of these are examples of bed forms. Generations of\nscientists and engineers have marveled at the rich and confusing variety of these\nfeatures.\n3.1.2 First we'll introduce some terminology. The overall bed geometry that\nexists at a given time in response to the flow (the bed configuration) is composed\nof individual topographic elements (bed forms). The aggregate or ensemble of\nlike bed configurations that can be produced by a given mean flow over a given\nsediment bed is the bed state: the bed configuration differs in detail from time to\ntime, and the bed state is a kind of average over the infinity of configurations\npossible under those conditions. The term bed phase can be used for recognizably\nor qualitatively different kinds of bed configurations that are produced over some\nrange of flow and sediment conditions and are closely related in geometry and\ndynamics. Finally, the term bedform (one word) is widely used, indiscriminately,\nfor all four aspects of the bed geometry.\n3.1.3 The flows that make bed configurations can be quite complex. Think\nin terms of two kinds of flow components, unidirectional and oscillatory (Figure\n2-40). The simplest cases are steady unidirectional flow, with constant flow speed\nin one direction, and symmetrical oscillatory flow, with a regular back-and forth\noscillation. But the unidirectional flow can be unsteady, and the oscillatory flow\ncan be asymmetrical (with the oscillation in one direction slower but of longer\nduration than the oscillation in the other direction).\n\nS\np\ne\nc\nt\nr\nu\nm\n\no\nf\n\nu\nn\ni\n¬\nd\nirectional and oscillatory flow components.\n3. BED CONFIGURATIONS\n3.1 Introduction\n3.1.1 A striking characteristic of the transport of granular sediment over a\nbed of the same material by a turbulent flow of fluid is that in a wide range of\nconditions the bed is molded into topographic features, called bed forms, on a\nscale orders of magnitude larger than the grains. Little ripples at one's feet at the\nseashore, or on a dry river bed, or in the desert; gigantic dunes in the desert and\n\n3.1.4 Also, the unidirectional and oscillatory components can be superim-\nposed or added together, resulting in what's called combined flow. For an ex-\nample, think about the shallow sea floor during a storm, with wave-induced\noscillatory flow superimposed on a storm-induced unidirectional flow. Also, there\ncan be more than one oscillatory component--in fact, there can be a continuous\nspectrum of oscillatory components, each with its own period and amplitude. This\nenormous range of generating flows, together with the complex dynamics of the\nresponse of the bed, makes for infinitely varied geometry of the resulting bed\nforms.\n3.1.5 Both engineers and geologists have been making laboratory experi-\nments on bed forms for well over a hundred years, as well as watching their\nmovement in natural flow environments. Our understanding of unidirectional-\nflow bed configurations is pretty good by now, although by no means perfect.\nWork on oscillatory-flow bed configurations is less well advanced: some impor-\ntant ranges of flow and sediment size have been little studied. Finally, combined-\nflow bed configurations are still very poorly known.\n3.1.6 If the flow changes with time, the bed configuration adjusts in re-\nsponse. In natural flows, equilibrium between the bed and the flow is the excep-\ntion rather than the rule; usually the bed configuration lags behind the change in\nthe flow. Such disequilibrium is a major element of complexity that makes rela-\ntionships among bed phases much more difficult to decipher, but its effects are of\ngreat importance in natural flow environments.\n3.1.7 Most bed forms are in sands, but they're produced in silts and gravels\nas well. Of greatest interest to geologists, oceanographers, and hydraulic engi-\nneers are bed forms produced by flows of air or water over mineral sediments, but\na far wider range, important in many engineering applications, can be produced by\nflows of Newtonian fluids with other densities and viscosities over sediments less\ndense or more dense than the common mineral sediments.\n3.1.8 Apart from their intrinsic scientific interest, bed forms are important in\nboth geology and engineering. Large subaqueous bed forms many meters high\ncan be obstacles to navigation, and their movement can be a threat to submarine\nstructures. The rugged topography of bed forms in rivers and tidal channels\ncauses flow separation at the crests and therefore large values of form drag; bed\nforms are thus the most important determinant of resistance to channel flow. The\nbed state is also closely bound up with the sediment transport rate in unidirectional\nflows, in that the downcurrent movement of the bed forms largely involves\nrecycling of bed load within bed forms. Sedimentologists have given attention to\nbed forms mostly because of their role in the development of stratification in sedi-\nmentary deposits; bed forms are one of the most useful tools available for in-\nterpreting ancient sedimentary environments.\n3.1.9 The status of observations on bed configurations leaves much to be de-\nsired. It's easy to observe bed configurations in steady unidirectional and bidi-\nrectional flows in laboratory channels and tanks, and the major outlines are by\nnow fairly well known, at least for unidirectional flows. But there's a lot of room\nfor further laboratory work, both because the usually small width-to-depth ratios\nof tanks and flumes tend to inhibit full development of the three-dimensional\naspects of the bed geometry, and also because virtually no work has been done\nwith multidirectional oscillatory flows, with or without a unidirectional\n\ncomponent. And even the largest of laboratory experiments are restricted to flow\ndepths at the lower end of the range of natural flow depths. In nature, on the other\nhand, observations on bed configurations are limited by practical and technical\ndifficulties, and the flows that produce them are usually more complicated.\n\n3.2 Unidirectional-Flow Bed Configurations\n\n3 .2.1 Introduction\n3.2.1.1 Bed configurations made by unidirectional flows have been studied\nmore than those made by oscillatory flows and combined flows. They're what you\nfind in rivers, large and small, and in engineering flows like outdoor canals and\nchannels of various kinds, as well as in pipes and conduits carrying granular\nmaterials, whether by design or incidentally.\n3.2.1.2 But they're also important in shallow marine environments, espe-\ncially in areas with strong tidal currents. Even symmetrically reversing tidal\ncurrents produce bed forms that look much like those in truly unidirectional flows,\npresumably because the current in each direction lasts long enough for the bed to\nrespond to what it feels as a unidirectional flow (although there's some debate\nabout this among the experts). In asymmetrical tidal currents, the bed forms show\nnet movement and asymmetry in the direction of the stronger flow, but they suffer\ninteresting modifications by the weaker flow in the other direction.\n3.2.1.3 We'll first describe a home experiment to give you an overall picture\nof the kinds of bed configurations made by currents, and then present a dimen-\nsional analysis to organize in more detail what's known about the hydraulic con-\nditions for the various kinds of configurations. Then we'll tell you some of the\nmost important things about flow and sediment movement over bed forms.\n\n3 .2.2 A Flume Experiment on Unidirectional-Flow Bed Configurations\n3.2.2.1 To get an idea of the bed configurations produced by a steady uni-\nform flow of water over a sand bed, and the succession of different kinds of bed\nconfigurations that appear as the flow strength is increased, make a series of ex-\nploratory flume experiments on sand with some mean size between about 0.2 mm\nand 0.5 mm.\n3.2.2.2 First of all, you need a flume (Figure 2-41). You could wangle your\nway into a hydraulics lab, or you could build your own in your backyard (or even,\nwe suppose, in your room.) Mainly you need a long channel that holds water and\nempties into a tank at the downstream end. Install a pump and some piping to take\nthe water from the downstream tank and recirculate it back up to the head of the\nchannel. You might also mount the whole channel on a set of screw jacks near the\nupstream end, so that you can change the slope of the channel easily. It would\nalso be nice to make at least one sidewall of the channel out of transparent acrylic\nplastic, for good viewing.\n\nA\n\nf\nl\nu\nm\ne\n.\n\n3.2.2.3 Place a thick layer of sand on the bottom of the channel, and then\npass a series of steady uniform flows over it. Arrange each run to have the same\nmean flow depth (as great as the flume will allow, a large fraction of a meter if\nyou're lucky) and increase the mean flow velocity slightly from run to run.\n3.2.2.4 In each run, let the flow interact with the bed long enough for the\nstate of the bed to be statistically steady; after that the details of the bed configu-\nration are in constant change but the average state of the bed remains the same.\nThe time required for the flow and the bed to come into a new state of equilibrium\nmight take from as little as a few minutes to as long as several days, depending on\nthe sediment transport rate, the size of the bed forms being developed, and the\nextent of modification of bed forms left over from the preceding run.\n3.2.2.5 You could speed the attainment of equilibrium a little by continually\nadjusting the slope of the whole channel to maintain uniform flow as the bed\nroughness changes, but these adjustments are not necessary, because the flow itself\nadjusts the bed for uniform flow by erosion at one end and deposition at the other.\nFor example, if the flume slope is too gentle, you'll end up with the sand bed\nthinner at the downstream end than at the upstream end, and the slope of the bed\nand the flow will be greater than the slope of the channel. On the other hand, if\nthe flume slope is too steep, the sand bed will be thicker at the downstream end\nthan at the upstream end. This kind of thing is OK so long as the layer of sand in\nthe channel doesn't taper so sharply that the channel bottom is bare in the upper or\nlower reaches.\n3.2.2.6 If you're impatient for results, the way to make bed forms develop\nfastest is to start with an irregular sediment bed. But it's more enlightening to start\nwith a planar bed. (You can arrange one fairly easily by passing a straight\nhorizontal scraper blade along the bed. If the blade is mounted on something that\nslides on the straight upper edges of the flume walls, you get a nice planar result.)\nNow turn on the pump and gradually increase the flow velocity. The beginning of\nsediment movement would be in accordance with the threshold curve discussed\nearlier (Figure 2-42A). Wait a while, and the flow will build very small ir-\nregularities at random points on the bed, not more than several grain diameters\nhigh, from which small ripples develop spontaneously.\n\nS\ne\nq\nu\ne\nn\nc\ne\n\no\nf\n\nb\ne\nd\n\nc\no\nnfigurations.\n\n3.2.2.7 You can help things along by poking your finger into the planar bed\nat some point to localize the first appearance of the ripples. The flow soon trans-\nforms the little mound you made with your finger into a flow-molded bed form.\nThe flow disturbance caused by this bed form scours the bed just downstream, and\npiles up enough sediment for another bed form to be produced, and so on until a\nbeautiful widening train of downstream-growing bed forms is formed (Figure\n2-43). Little trains of bed forms like this, starting from various points on the bed,\nsoon join together and pass through a complicated stage of development, finally to\nbecome a fully developed bed configuration (Figure 2-42B). The stronger the\ngrain transport, the sooner the bed forms appear, and the faster they approach\nequilibrium. These bed forms, which we'll later classify as ripples, show generally\ntriangular cross sections.\n\nA\n\nt\nr\na\ni\nn\n\no\nf\n\nr\ni\np\np\nl\nes.\n\n3.2.2.8 (We'll stop right here and introduce some terms for ripplelike bed\nforms; see Figure 2-44. The region around the highest point on the ripple profile\nis the crest, and the region around the lowest point is the trough. The upstream-\nfacing surface of the ripple, extending from a trough to the next crest downstream,\nis the stoss surface; the downstream-facing surface, extending from a crest to the\nnext trough downstream, is the lee surface. A well defined and nearly planar\nsegment of the lee surface, called the slip face, is usually a prominent part of the\nprofile. The top of the slip face is marked by a sharp break in slope called the\nbrink. There's often but not always a break in slope at the base of the slip face\nalso. The top of the slip face is not always the highest point on the profile, and the\nbase of the slip face is not always the lowest point on the profile.\n\nT\ne\nr\nm\ni\nn\no\nl\no\ng\ny for ripplelike bed forms.\n\n3.2.2.9 The stoss surfaces of ripples are gently sloping, usually less than\nabout 10° relative to the mean plane of the bed, and their lee surfaces are steeper,\nusually at or close to the angle of repose of the granular material in water. Crests\nand troughs are oriented dominantly transverse to the mean flow, but are irregular\nin detail in height and arrangement. The average spacing of ripples is of the order\nof 10-20 cm, and the average height is a few centimeters. The bed is said to be\nthree-dimensional, rather than two-dimensional as it would be if the ripples were\nregular and straight-crested. The ripples move downstream (orders of magnitude\nslower than the flow itself) by erosion of sediment from the stoss surface and\ndeposition of sediment on the lee surface.\n3.2.2.10 At a flow velocity that's a middling fraction of a meter per second,\nripples are replaced by larger bed forms generally called dunes. Dunes are\nbroadly similar to ripples in geometry and movement, but they are about an order\nof magnitude larger (Figure 2-42C). The transition from ripples to dunes is\ncomplete over a narrow range of only a few centimeters per second in flow ve-\nlocity. Within this transition the bed geometry is complicated: the ripples become\nslightly larger, with ill-defined larger forms intermingled, and then abruptly the\nlarger forms become better organized and dominate the smaller forms. With\nincreasing flow velocity, more and more sediment is transported over the dunes as\nsuspended load. If you had a large enough flume at your disposal the dunes would\nbecome large enough under some conditions of sand size and current velocity for\nsmaller dunes to be superimposed on larger dunes.\n3.2.2.11 With further increase in velocity the dunes become lower and more\nrounded, over a fairly wide interval of flow velocity, until finally they disappear\nentirely, giving way to a planar bed surface over which abundant suspended load\nas well as bed load is transported (Figure 2-42D). Judging from the appearance of\nthe bed after the flow is abruptly brought to a stop, the transport surface is\nstrikingly planar: relief is no greater than a few grain diameters. Since the bed is\nobscured, it's difficult to observe the mode of grain transport except through the\nsidewall.\n3.2.2.12 As the flow velocity is increased still further, subdued standing\nwaves appear on the water surface, and the resulting pattern of higher and lower\nnear-bed flow velocity causes the bed to be molded correspondingly into a train of\nwaves in phase with the water-surface waves. As the velocity of the mean flow\napproaches the velocity with which the surface waves can propagate upstream, so\nthat the waves are almost standing still, these coupled bed and surface waves\nincrease in amplitude and become unstable: they move slowly upstream and at the\nsame time grow in amplitude, until they become so steep that they break abruptly,\nthrowing much sediment into suspension (Figure 2-42E). The bed and water\nsurface then revert to a planar or nearly planar condition, whereupon the waves\nbuild again and the cycle is repeated. Because of their upstream movement these\nforms are called antidunes.\n3.2.2.13 An instructive variant of this experiment would be to increase the\nflow depth by a factor of two and cover the entire flow with a rigid planar sheet\nparallel to the mean plane of the bed. The flow structure in the lower half of the\nclosed duct thus formed is not greatly different from that in the original open-\nchannel flow, with some differences caused by the gross difference in roughness\nof the upper and lower boundaries when bed forms are present on the bed. Make\n\nthe same sequence of runs with the top cover in place, and you'd find the same\nsuccession of bed configurations except for one major difference: standing waves\nand antidunes would not appear, and plane-bed transport would be observed up\nto indefinitely high velocities. This should tip you off that the dynamics of an-\ntidunes is unrelated to the dynamics of ripples, dunes, and plane bed. Antidunes\nare dependent upon the presence of the free surface, whereas ripples and dunes are\nindependent of the presence of the free surface.\n\n3 .2.3 Bed-Configuration Regimes\n3.2.3.1 It's extremely useful in physical sedimentology to know something\nabout the conditions of occurrence of the various kinds of bed configurations, in\nlarge part because a lot of the cross-stratification we see in the ancient sedimentary\nrecord, probably most, is an outcome of the movement of flow-transverse bed\nforms like ripples and dunes in flows of water or air in a variety of sedimentary\nenvironments.\n3.2.3.2 The idea, elaborated in the rest of this section, is that each bed phase\nexists or is formed in a certain definite range of the various variables that govern\nor characterize the development of bed configurations. The right way to go about\ndoing this is to list all of the variables we think are important and then organize or\nrecast them into a set of dimensionless variables (fewer in number than the\noriginal set) that describes the phenomenon in the most useful and the most\ngeneral way. Doing this would require a considerable detour to lay the back-\nground for the technique. But we can take a shortcut at this point, similar to what\nwas done in Section 2 above for describing the threshold of sediment movement,\nwithout sacrificing any ultimate usefulness or introducing any serious distortion:\neliminate from the list of variables those that don't vary much for quartz-density\nsand in water-density fluid on planetary surfaces with Earth-like gravity, leaving\nonly a few important variables, and then plot a multidimensional graph (which we\nhope will be no more than three-dimensional!) in which the various bed phases\noccupy contiguous stability fields or existence fields, with boundary curves of\nsurfaces separating the fields. You could think of these regions as \"bed-\nconfiguration regimes\" of the kind you observed in the backyard experiment.\nThis is a way of systematizing and unifying disparate data on bed states in a wide\nvariety of flows and sediments. Such graphs are closely analogous to the phase\ndiagrams thermodynamicists and petrologists work with.\n3.2.3.3 The variables that characterize the development of bed configura-\ntions fall naturally into those that characterize the fluid, the flow, and the sediment.\nThe sediment might best be described by its mean size, sorting, particle shape, and\ndensity. In the interest of a manageable exercise here, let's assume that the most\nimportant of these are mean size and density. The flow can be described by its\nmean flow depth and mean flow velocity. (If you find yourself wondering what\nhappened to the bed shear stress, which is what moves the sediment, see below.)\nThe fluid is described by its density and viscosity. Finally, the acceleration of\ngravity must be included, for two reasons: it helps determine particle weight, and\nit figures in the behavior of surface gravity waves. That makes for seven variables\naltogether.\n\n3.2.3.4 Which of the seven variables vary substantially in sediment-moving\nflows of water on the Earth's surface? Only four of them: flow depth, flow\nvelocity, mean sediment size, and fluid viscosity. The viscosity of water varies\nsubstantially over the natural range of wager temperatures from 0°C to about\n30°C, but the effect isn't overwhelming, so you can get most of the picture just by\nthinking about plotting data on bed configurations in a three-axis graph (which\nwe'll call the depth-velocity-size diagram) with flow depth, flow velocity, and\nsediment size along the axes. Such a graph shows the bed-configuration regimes\nin concrete and only slightly fuzzy form.\n\n3.2.3.6 You might be wondering why the bed shear stress τo doesn't appear\nin the foregoing analysis, when after all it's the force of the flow on the bed that\nmoves sediment to mold bed configurations in the first place, right? We can make\ntwo comments about that:\n\nθ When ripples or dunes are on the bed, most of τo is form drag resulting\nfrom pressure differences between upstream and downstream faces of the bed\nforms, and the local bed shear stress (what's usually called skin friction)--which is\nwhat actually moves the sediment--is only a minor part of τo!\nθ\nUsing τo introduces a kind of double-valuedness that messes up the\nbed-phase diagrams by making adjacent existence field overlap.\nHere's why. Keeping in mind the series of runs in your backyard\nchannel, think about what happens to τo as U increases over the bed\n(Figure 2-45). At first τo increases with U, as ripples and then dunes\ndevelop. But then when the dunes are washed out to plane bed, τo\ndecreases, because the form drag disappears. Then with increasing\nvelocity over a plane bed, τo increases again. So there's a range of\nU for which three different values of τo are possible. If you use τo\nas the flow-strength variable, the bed-phase graph is going to have a\nserious ambiguity whereby certain fields overlap one another. This\nisn't a problem if you use U: there's a nice one-to-one cor-\nrespondence between bed states and points on the graph.\n\nBed shear stress vs. mean flow velocity.\n\n3.2.3.7 The best way to visualize the depth-velocity-size diagram is to draw\ntwo kinds of planar sections through it, in the depth-velocity plane and in the ve-\nlocity-size plane (Figure 2-46). Figure 2-47 shows depth-velocity sections for\nthree different sediment sizes, together with cartoon versions, and Figure 2-48\nshows a velocity-size section together with a cartoon version. These graphs are\nbased on laboratory experiments mainly at flow depths less than a meter. (It's a lot\nharder to get data points from deeper natural flows.) These graphs are actually\ndimensionless graphs, but they've been normalized or standardized to a water\ntemperature of 10°C for comparability and concreteness. If you don't want to\nworry about dimensionless variables, just think of the axes as real depth, velocity,\nand size.\n\nD\ne\np\nt\nh\n-\nv\ne\nl\no\nc\ni\nt\ny\n-\nsize diagram.\n\n3.2.3.8 The depth-velocity graph for 0.10-0.14 mm sand (Figure 2-47A)\nshows fields only for ripples, upper-regime plane bed, and antidunes. All the\nboundaries here and in the other two depth-velocity sections in Figure 2-47 slope\nupward to the right. The ripple-plane boundary does so because the deeper the\nflow the greater the velocity needed for a given bed shear stress; the plane-an-\ntidune boundary does so because it's closely associated with the condition for\nwhich surface waves can propagate upstream about as fast as the flow itself flows\ndownstream, so that the surface waves can interact unstably with the bed to pro-\nduce antidunes. The latter boundary is shown to truncate the former, because as\nthe condition just mentioned is approached, antidunes develop whatever the pre-\nexisting configuration. This relation holds true also, and more clearly, for coarser\nsediments (Figures 2-47B, 2-47C).\n\nD\ne\np\nt\nh\n-\nv\ne\nl\no\nc\ni\nt\ny\n\ns\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\n.\n\n3.2.3.9 In Figure 2-47A (and in Figure 2-47B, for medium sands, as well)\nthere are two kinds of boundary between movement and no movement. To the\nright is a modification of the threshold curve for incipient movement on a plane\nbed, appropriately transformed into this depth-velocity graph. To the left is the\nripple-maintenance boundary, which defines the minimum velocity needed to\nmaintain preexisting ripples at equilibrium. The ripple-maintenance boundary is\nnot well constrained by data, so it's shown only in the cartoon, but it clearly lies at\nlower flow velocities than the plane-bed threshold curve.\n3.2.3.10 The depth-velocity graph for 0.40-0.50 mm sand (Figure 2-47B)\nshows an additional field for dunes between those for ripples and plane bed, with\nits high-velocity boundary clearly sloping less steeply than the low-velocity\nboundary. For depths less than about 0.05 m it's difficult to differentiate between\nripples and dunes, because dunes become severely limited in size by the shallow\nflow depth. The appearance and expansion of the dune field with increasing\nsediment size pushes the lower termination of the plane-bed field to greater depths\nand velocities, nearly out of the range of most flume work (but not of natural\nflows!). The antidune field truncates not only the ripple field, as with finer sands,\nbut the dune field as well.\n3.2.3.11 In the depth-velocity graph for 1.30-1.80 mm sand (Figure 2-47C),\na lower-regime plane bed replaces ripples at low flow velocities. Upper-regime\nplane bed is still present in the upper right but few flume data are available.\nUpper-regime plane beds succeed antidunes with increasing flow velocity and de-\ncreasing flow depth in the lower right. (This passage from plane bed to antidunes\nand back into plane bed is sort of analogous to breaking the sound barrier: once\nyou get past the condition wherein surface waves have the same speed as the flow,\nthe coupling that leads to antidunes disappears again.) The boundary between no\nmovement and lower plane bed is shown as the threshold curve for incipient\nmovement on a plane bed. Sections for even greater sediment sizes are\nqualitatively similar to that in Figure 2-47C.\n3.2.3.12 In the velocity-size graph for flow depths of 0.25-0.40 m (Figure\n2-48), ripples are stable for sediments finer than about 0.8 mm. The range of\nvelocities for ripples narrows with increasing sediment size to terminate against\nthe fields for plane beds with or without movement. Relationships in this region\nare difficult to study because in these sand sizes and flow speeds it takes a long\ntime for the bed to attain equilibrium. In medium sands ripples give way abruptly\nto dunes with increasing flow velocity, but in finer sediment, ripples give way\n(also abruptly) to plane bed. Although not well constrained, the ripple-plane\nboundary rises to higher velocities with decreasing sediment size.\n3.2.3.13 Dunes are stable over a wide range of flow velocities in sediments\nfrom medium sand to indefinitely coarse gravel. Both the lower and upper\nboundaries of the dune field rise with increasing velocity, and both are gradual\ntransitions rather than sharp breaks. For sediments coarser than about 0.8 mm\nthere's a narrow field below the dune field for lower-regime plane bed; the lower\nboundary of this field is represented by the curve for threshold of sediment\nmovement on a plane bed.\n3.2.3.14 There's one triple point among ripples, dunes, and upper plane bed\nat a sediment size of about 0.2 mm, and another among ripples, dunes and lower\nplane bed at a sediment size of about 0.8 mm. The coverage of data around these\n\ntwo triple points constrains the bed-phase relationships fairly closely. Between\nthese two triple points the dune field forms a kind of indented salient pointing\ntoward finer sediment sizes. The boundary between ripples and upper plane bed\nseems to pass beneath the dune field at the upper left triple point to emerge again\nat coarser sizes and lower velocities as the boundary between ripples and lower\nplane bed at the lower right triple point. We might speculate that the ripple-plane\nboundary is eclipsed by development of dunes on the bed over a certain range of\nflow velocities and sediment sizes. This interpretation has some experimental\nsupport: when the development of dunes is suppressed in very short channels,\nripples persist to higher velocities. The stability fields for ripples and dunes thus\nseem to be controlled by dynamically separate effects, and the position of the\nboundary is mediated by the interaction between the two competing effects.\n\n3.2.3.15 The depth-velocity-size diagram shown in Figures 2-47 and 2-48\nspans a depth range of more than an order of magnitude, from less than a tenth of\na meter to almost a meter, with good coverage of data. Figure 2-49 shows\nschematic velocity-size sections, superimposed on the same plot, for flow depths\nof 0.3 m, 1 m, and 3 m. The 0.3 m and 1 m boundaries are well tied down by\nflume data, but the 3 m boundary is just an extrapolation from shallower depths.\nBut the field boundaries are constrained well enough in the 0.1-1.0 m depth range\nthat extrapolation by even another order of magnitude to about ten meters, to\ncover much of the range of natural flow depths in rivers and tidal currents,\nshouldn't introduce any gross distortions in velocity estimates for the various fields\nand their boundaries. You can see from Figure 2-49 that with increasing flow\ndepth, all phase boundaries shift upward, the antidune boundary the most rapidly,\nand the dune field spans a greater range of velocities. The sediment sizes\nassociated with the two triple points seem to change little with flow depth. You\ncan compare this extrapolation with the \"Rubin diagram\" (Figure 2-50), assembled\nby Rubin and McCulloch (1980), which shows the depth-velocity-size diagram for\ndeeper natural flows.\n\nV\ne\nl\no\nc\ni\nt\ny\n-\ns\ni\nz\ne\n\ns\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n.\n\nS\nc\nh\ne\nm\na\nt\ni\nc\n\nv\ne\nl\no\nc\ni\nt\ny\n-size sections.\n\nT\nh\ne\n\nR\nu\nb\ni\nn\n\nd\ni\na\ng\nr\na\nm\n.\n\nFigure 2-50: The Rubin diagram: the depth-velocity-size diagram for a wide range of\nflow depths in flumes and natural flow environments\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n3.2.3.16 It's important to know not just the conditions for existence of\nthe various bed phases, but also something about how their size and shape varies\nwithin those fields. This is a more demanding task, because you have to measure\nthe bed forms rather than just discover their existence. Even in flumes that's dif-\nficult, to say nothing about natural flow environments. This boils down to\nknowing how the height and spacing of dunes varies with flow depth, flow veloc-\nity, and sand size, because ripples don't vary much in size or shape over most of\ntheir range of existence. Figure 2-51 shows crude contours of dune spacing\n(Figure 2-51A) and dune height (Figure 2-51B) in a depth-velocity graph, and\nFigure 2-52 shows crude contours of dune spacing (Figure 2-52A) and dune\nheight (Figure 2-52B) in a velocity-size graph. Data are from the USGS flume\nprogram in the 1950s and 1960s (Guy et al., 1966).\n\nC\no\nn\nt\no\nu\nr\ns\n\no\nf\n\nd\nu\nn\ne\n\ns\np\nacing and height in depth-velocity section.\n\nC\no\nn\nt\no\nu\nr\ns\n\no\nf\n\nd\nu\nn\ne\n\nspacing and height in velocity-size section.\n\n3.2.3.18 In the depth-velocity section (Figure 2-51A), dune spacing in-\ncreases from lower left to upper right, with increasing depth and velocity, although\nthe extent of the data points does not constrain the slopes of the contours well. In\nthe velocity-size section (Figure 2-52A), dune spacing increases from lower right\nto upper left with increasing velocity and decreasing sediment size; the greatest\nspacings are at the upper-plane-bed boundary and a sediment size of between 0.2\nand 0.3 mm. Dune height shows a different and more complicated behavior. In\nthe depth-velocity section (Figure 2-51B), dune height increases monotonically\nwith increasing depth but shows an increase and then a decrease with increasing\nflow velocity at constant depth. In the velocity-size section (Figure 2-52B), there\nis an elongated core of greatest heights extending from near the left-hand\nextremity of the dune field, at the finest sizes of about 0.2 mm, rightward to sizes\nof 0.5 to 0.6 mm. Heights seem to decrease in all directions from that core, most\nrapidly with decreasing flow velocity.\n\n3 .2.4 Flow and Sediment Movement over Ripples and Dunes\n3.2.4.1 Flow over ripples and dunes is dominated by flow separation, a phe-\nnomenon whereby the flow separates from the solid boundary in the region where\nthe boundary curves away from the general upstream flow direction. The general\npicture of separated flow over a ripple or a dune is shown in Figure 2-53, and in\nmore cartoonlike form in Figure 2-54. When the flow reaches the crest it\ncontinues to move in the same direction rather than bending downward to follow\nthe contour of the bed. Strong turbulence develops along the surface of strong\nshear, called the shear layer, which represents the contrast between the high\nvelocity in the separated flow and the low velocity in the shelter of the bed form.\nThis turbulence expands both upward and downward, and at some position down-\nstream of the crest the turbulent shear layer meets the sediment bed. The flow is\n\nsaid to reattach to the bed at that point. Downstream of reattachment, the flow\nnear the bed is directed downstream once again. Upstream of reattachment, in\nwhat is called the separation vortex, the bed feels a weak flow in the reverse\ndirection.\n\nG\ne\nn\ne\nr\na\nl structure of separate\nd flow.\n\nFigure 2-53: General structure of separated flow over a ripple or a dune\n\nC\na\nr\nt\no\no\nn\nl\ni\nk\ne\nversion of general structure of separated flow.\n\n3.2.4.2 Take a tour of a ripple or dune profile by starting at a crest, sliding\ndown the slip face, and then walking across the trough and up the stoss surface\ndownstream (Figure 2-55). The flow you'd sense would differ greatly along the\nprofile. You could actually do this on a big dune in a river or a tidal current, or on\na subaerial dune. Refer to Figures 2-53 and 2-54 as you read on.\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nA\n\nt\no\nu\nr\n\no\nf a ripple or dune.\n\n3.2.4.3 Turbulence rapidly develops on the shear surface extending down-\nstream from the separation point at the ripple crest. The turbulent shear layer\ngrows upward into the now-separated boundary layer above, and also downward.\nThe streamline (defined only in a time-average sense) that extends downstream\nfrom the point of separation at the crest, called the dividing streamline, descends\ngently toward the trough, as the overall flow tries to follow the ripple profile.\n3.2.4.4 At about ten step heights or a little less downstream, the shear layer\nmeets the bed at a moderate angle at a stagnation point (also well defined only in a\ntime-average sense). The shear layer is said to reattach to the boundary at that\npoint. (Technically it's a stagnation line rather than a stagnation point.) At\nreattachment the flow in the shear layer divides: some is diverted upchannel, but\nmost continues downchannel, now in contact with the bed.\n3.2.4.5 The space below the shear layer and upstream of the reattachment\nline is called the separation bubble (although it has nothing to do with bubbles\nsensu stricto). Turbulent mixing of fluid from the top of the separation bubble\ninto the lower part of the shear layer, together with the upchannel diversion of a\npart of the shear layer at reattachment, combine to produce a weak vortex or\nroller, with sense of circulation shown in Figure 2-54. As you moved down the\nlee face and out onto the trough you'd feel a weak, irregular, eddying current in the\nopposite direction.\n3.2.4.6 Near the reattachment line you'd feel the full effect of the turbulence\nin the shear layer. In the reattachment zone the strong eddies generated in the\nshear layer impinge upon the bed and flatten out against it to cause temporarily\nvery high local shear stresses. You'd feel strong puffs of flow trying to push you\nthis way and that. But even though the shear stress is high at certain points and\ncertain times, it's nearly zero on the average; the time-average component of\nvelocity parallel to the bed is zero at the reattachment line, by definition, so the\ntime-average local boundary shear stress is just about zero there also. Both the\nnear-bed velocity and the average boundary shear stress increase sharply down-\nstream from reattachment, but the magnitudes of the fluctuations decrease.\n3.2.4.7 The flow a short distance downstream of reattachment has a very\ncomplex structure. There are three layers:\n\nθ The shear layer developed by separation is now flowing in contact with the\nbed.\nθ Above the reattached shear layer is the original boundary-layer flow from\nupstream, which maintains its identity for a long distance downstream of\nseparation even as it's consumed from below.\n\nθ As it moves up the stoss surface, the flow in the reattached shear layer has to\nadjust itself to the presence of the boundary by development of a new\nboundary layer (an example of an internal boundary layer) upward from the\nbed. In this way the presence of the boundary eventually alters the\nstructure of the turbulence in both of the other two layers above; the dis-\nturbed boundary layer is said to relax toward the new equilibrium state.\n\n3.2.4.8 If a planar boundary extended far enough downstream, the new\nboundary layer would eventually develop through the entire flow depth, and the\nvelocity gradient and therefore the bed shear stress would decrease gradually from\na maximum just downstream of reattachment to equilibrium values far\ndownstream. But in flow over a ripple, redevelopment is still incomplete where\nthe flow reaches the crest, so the flow well above the crest senses little of the\nprofound changes in near-bed flow. The flow throughout the growing boundary\nlayer and the degrading shear layer above it is accelerated as it's crowded upward\nover the upsloping stoss surface. It doesn't take much of a slope for this\nacceleration to cause an increase in both boundary shear stress and near-bed ve-\nlocity up the stoss surface, so the near-bed flow is strongest as it reaches the crest\nto separate again.\n3.2.4.9 The mode of sediment transport varies greatly from place to place\nover the ripple or dune profile. A repetition of your traverse, just to watch the\nsediment movement, would be good. See Figure 2-56 for a key to what's dis-\ncussed below. Start at the reattachment zone, where time-average bed-load\ntransport rate is near zero. Strong eddies in the reattaching shear layer impinge\nupon the bed to cause strong but sporadic grain transport. At low mean-flow\nvelocities sediment is shifted this way and that on the bed in local pulses that\nstrike seemingly at random. This is the site of first suspension of sediment as flow\nvelocity gradually increases: swirls of sediment are put into suspension in puffs\nand gusts, and then the grains either settle directly back to the bed or are dispersed\nup into the flow.\n\nS\ne\nd\ni\nm\ne\nn\nt\n\nm\no\nv\neme\nnt over a ripple or dune.\n\n3.2.4.10 Downchannel from reattachment the pulses of movement are di-\nrected more and more consistently downchannel and gradually give way to more\nuniform grain movement up the stoss slope. In the other direction they cease to be\nimportant just a short distance upchannel from reattachment, because flow in the\nseparation vortex is relatively weak.\n3.2.4.11 Grain movement up the stoss surface is much like that on a planar\nsediment bed: as isolated puffs at low mean-flow velocities, and as a continuous\nsheet at higher velocities. With increasing velocity the bed-load movement is ob-\nscured by sediment suspended from the trough or from upstream ripples. Dunes\noften have ripples or even smaller dunes superimposed on their stoss slopes; this\nshouldn't surprise you, because such bed forms are very opportunistic, and will\ndevelop wherever they have enough space and the right flow conditions.\n3.2.4.12 At low flow velocities all the sediment transported as bed load to\nthe brink is dumped there, tending to build the stoss surface forward over the top\nof the lee surface. The sediment slips down the lee surface as a kind of grain flow\nto try to restore a stable angle of repose. Grain flow is localized and sporadic\nwhen the rate of delivery is slow, but widespread and continuous at higher flow\nvelocities. The result is a nearly planar lee surface, the slip face, with a break in\nslope not only at the top but also at the base, where the slip face builds forward\nonto the surface of the trough downstream.\n3.2.4.13 At higher flow velocities some fraction of the transported grains are\ncarried beyond the crest above the separation surface, to settle through the\ncomplicated turbulent flow field in the wake of the ripple and land at various\npoints (Figure 2-57): on the slip face, in the trough, on the stoss surface of the\nnext ripple downstream, or even on some ripple much farther downstream. Where\nthe grains land depends on several things: the flow velocity, the settling velocity,\nthe height of the grains above the bed as they pass over the brink, and just which\neddies the grains happen to fall through.\n\nS\no\nm\ne\n\nt\nr\na\nn\ns\np\no\nr\nted grains carried beyond the crest.\n\n3.2.4.14 When the ripple geometry is three-dimensional many troughs show\nno well defined separation vortex, and patterns of flow and sediment transport are\nnot as simple as outlined above. The bed surface near the base of the lee slope\nnonetheless usually feels flows that are much weaker than over the stoss slope,\nalthough these flows may have a substantial cross-stream component. Transverse\nflow in the lee of the dunes often makes ripples in troughs and on lee slopes, with\ncrests oriented at a large and variable angle to the dune crests.\n3.2.4.15 Ripples and dunes move downstream, at speeds orders of magni-\ntude slower than the flow speed, by erosion on the stoss surface and deposition on\nthe lee. It's surprisingly difficult to characterize this downstream movement,\npartly because the bed forms change their profiles with time, but even more im-\nportantly because any given bed form has a finite lifetime: it's formed, it moves,\nand it eventually dies, usually within a travel distance equal to only a small mul-\ntiple of the bed-form spacing, something like 5-10 spacings. A good way to ap-\nprehend the transitory existence of individual bed forms is to take a time-lapse\nmovie of a moving train of ripples in your flume. When you viewed the film at\nnormal speed you'd see the ripples doing all sorts of crazy things that are hard to\nappreciate by real-time viewing; the moderately regular arrangement of ripples in\nstill life is deceiving.\n\n3.3 Oscillatory-Flow and Combined-Flow Bed Configurations\n\n3 .3.1 Introduction\n3.3.1.1 Remember from the discussion of gravity waves that shallow-water\nwaves propagating in water much shallower than the wavelength cause a back-\nand-forth motion of the water at the bottom. If the maximum speed of the water\n(which is attained in the middle of the oscillation) exceeds the threshold for sed-\niment movement, oscillatory-flow bed forms develop. This is common in the\nshallow ocean, where swell from distant storms causes bottom oscillatory motion\neven though the weather is fine and calm locally. Bottom-water motions under\nlarge storm waves cause bed forms too, but then there's likely to be a nonnegli-\ngible current running as well; we'll have something to say about such combined-\nflow bed forms in a later section.\n3.3.1.2 The treatment of oscillatory-flow bed configurations here will be the\nsame as that for unidirectional flow bed configurations above, although not as\nlengthy: after describing an exploratory flume experiment, we'll present what's\nknown about the existence fields of the various kinds of bed configuration.\n\n3 .3.2 A Tank Experiment on Oscillatory-Flow Bed Configurations\n3.3.2.1 There are three different ways to make oscillatory-flow bed config-\nurations in the home or laboratory. One is to build a big long tank and make\nwaves in it by putting a wave generator at one end and a wave absorber at the\nother end (Figure 2-58). The generator doesn't have to be anything more than a\nflap hinged at the bottom and rocked back and forth in the direction of the tank\naxis at the desired period. This arrangement makes nice bed forms, but the trouble\nis that you're limited to short oscillation periods.\n\nO\ns\nc\ni\nl\nl\na\ntory flow in a wave tank.\n\n3.3.2.2 Another good way to make oscillatory-flow bed configurations is to\nbuild a horizontal closed duct that connects smoothly with reservoir tanks at both\nends, fill the whole thing with water, and then put a piston in contact with the\nwater surface in one of the reservoir tanks and oscillate it up and down at the\nperiod you want (Figure 2-59). This lets you work with much longer-period\noscillations, but there's the practical problem that the apparatus has its own natural\noscillation period, and if you try to make oscillations at a much different period\nyou have to fight against what the duct wants to do, and that means big forces.\n\nO\ns\nc\ni\nl\nl\na\nt\no\nr\ny\n\nf\nlow in a closed duct.\n\n3.3.2.3 The third way should seem elegant and ingenious to you: place a\nsand-covered horizontal tray at the bottom of a big tank of water, and oscillate the\ntray back and forth underneath the water (Figure 2-60). The problem is that the\ndetails of particle and fluid accelerations are subtly different from the other two\ndevices, and it turns out that the bed configurations don't correspond well with\nthose produced in the other two ways.\n\nO\ns\nc\ni\nl\nl\na\nt\no\nr\ny\n\nflow in an oscillating-bed tank.\n\n3.3.2.4 We suggest that you build the horizontal closed duct apparatus, if\nyou still have room left in your back yard. The only problem, aside from fighting\nleaks, is the mechanical arrangement to make the up-and-down oscillation. Have\nyou ever seen those weird-looking pump jacks in oilfields? One of those would be\njust right for the job.\n3.3.2.5 Then you can make an exploratory series of runs to get a general idea\nof the nature of oscillatory-flow bed configurations. Work at just one oscillation\nperiod, in the range from three to five seconds. Start at a low velocity and increase\nit in steps. Here's the sequence of bed configurations you'd see (Figure 2-61).\n\nS\np\ne\nc\nt\nr\nu\nm\n\no\nf\n\no\ns\nc\ni\nl\nl\na\nt\no\nry-flow bed configurations.\n\n3.3.2.6 Once the movement threshold is reached, a pattern of extremely\nregular and straight-crested ripples develops on a previously planar bed. The\nripples are symmetrical in cross section, with sharp crests and broad troughs. In\nstriking contrast to unidirectional-flow bed configurations, the plan pattern is\nstrikingly regular: ripple size varies little from ripple to ripple. At fairly low\nvelocities the ripples are relatively small, with spacings of no more than several\ncentimeters, but with increasing velocity they get bigger and bigger.\n3.3.2.7 In a certain range of moderate velocities, the ripples become notice-\nably less regular and more three-dimensional, although they still are oriented\ndominantly across the oscillatory flow. These 3D ripples continue to grow in size\nwith increasing velocity, until eventually they become flattened and are finally\nwashed out to a planar bed. So, just as is true in unidirectional flows, rugged bed\nconfigurations pass over into a stable plane-bed mode of transport with increasing\nvelocity.\n3.3.2.8 We want to make a distinction here between what we'll call\noscillatory-current ripples and reversing-current ripples. Although the\nterminology is somewhat infelicitous, the distinction is significant. Oscillatory-\ncurrent ripples are dynamically related to the oscillatory current itself. These are\nthe ripples that start small and grow much larger as oscillation speed and period\nare increased, and are coupled in some not-well-understood way to the orbital\ndiameter. Reversing-current ripples, on the other hand, are dynamically akin to\nunidirectional-flow ripples, in that they are formed and maintained by the one-way\nflow during each part of the oscillation. The reversal of the current merely flips\ntheir symmetry, and also inhibits their full development. They live stunted lives in\n\nwhich they can develop no further than incipient unidirectional-flow ripples.\nSignificantly, their size is almost independent of the oscillation period and veloc-\nity.\n\n3 .3.3 Bed-Configuration Regimes\n3.3.3.1 Let's assume again that the sediment is described well enough by its\ndensity ρs and average size D. The oscillatory flow is specified by any two of the\nfollowing three variables: oscillation period T, orbital diameter do, and maximum\norbital velocity Um; let's use T and Um. As with unidirectional-flow bed\nconfigurations, we also need to include ρ, μ, and g. That makes seven variables.\nLet's take exactly the same approach as for unidirectional flow: the only variables\nof the seven that vary much in water flows transporting quartz-density sediment\non Earth are sediment size, oscillation period, maximum orbital velocity, and\nwater viscosity, and we can safely neglect the viscosity with only minor fuzziness\nof the results. So we can examine relationships among bed phases in a three-\ndimensional size-velocity-period graph.\n3.3.3.2 The most convenient and revealing way of looking at the size-veloc-\nity-period graph is by means of several velocity-period sections for different\nsediment sizes (Figure 2-62). Figure 2-63 shows two such sections, one for fine\nto very fine sands, with average size in a narrow range of 0.1-0.2 mm (Figure\n2-63A), and the other for coarser sands, with average size in the narrow range\n0.50-0.65 mm (Figure 2-63B). As with unidirectional flows, the axes are labeled\nwith the 10°C values of orbital velocity and oscillation period corresponding to the\nactual dimensionless variables, but you don't need to concern yourselves with that.\n\nV\ne\nl\no\nc\ni\nt\ny\n-\np\ne\nr\ni\no\nd\n-size diagram.\n\n3.3.3.3 In both parts of Figure 2-63 a broad field of ripples of various sizes\nand shapes is bounded below by a field where the flow is too weak to maintain\nequilibrium ripples and above by a field for transport over a planar bed. The\nboundary between ripples and plane bed is clear-cut, but because of the scarcity of\nofficial plane-bed data points (not shown), is fairly well constrained only at\nintermediate oscillation periods. The boundary between ripples and no ripple\nmaintenance is less well defined, owing to a lack of well documented runs. This\nboundary is drawn arbitrarily to be horizontal. As in the unidirectional case, there\nactually are two boundaries in this region of the graph, one for development of\nripples on a planar bed and the other for maintenance of preexisting ripples with\nslowly decreasing velocity. The ripple field clearly broadens rightward. The\nminimum period for generation of ripples seems not to have been studied, but in\nany case is unimportant for natural sedimentary environments.\n\n3.3.3.4 In Figure 2-63A, for very fine to fine sand, ripple spacings increase\nfrom about 0.05 m at periods of less than 2 s to well over a meter at periods ap-\nproaching 10 s. Crude contours of spacing, drawn where possible, are nearly\nparallel to lines of equal orbital diameter do, reflecting the well known tendency\nfor oscillatory-flow ripples to scale with orbital diameter, but there seems to be a\ntendency for these contours to be steeper than the lines of constant do. The out-\nstanding feature of this graph is a transition from regular and straight-crested\nripples (two-dimensional ripples) at low oscillatory speeds and small periods to\nirregular (three-dimensional ripples) at high oscillatory speeds and long periods.\nThis transition has been reported in several studies but hasn't been studied in de-\ntail. Ripple spacings in some of these three-dimensional ripple runs were not re-\nported even approximately. At the longest oscillation periods typical of shallow\nmarine environments, in the range 8-20 s, large three-dimensional ripples are the\nstable configuration at oscillation speeds up to about one meter per second.\n\nV\ne\nl\no\nc\ni\nt\ny\n-\np\ne\nr\ni\no\nd\n\ns\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n.\n\n3.3.3.5 It's clear that all of the two-dimensional ripples, at relatively small\norbital velocities are oscillatory-current ripples, as defined earlier. The onset of\nthree-dimensional geometry with increasing orbital velocity at any given oscilla-\ntion period seems to reflect the development of reversing-current ripples (which\nare dynamically akin to current ripples in unidirectional flows, and vary little in\nspacing) and their increasingly strong interaction with the oscillatory-current\nripples. At longer oscillation periods and even greater orbital velocities the\noscillatory-current ripples grow to be much larger than the reversing-current\nripples, thus eliminating the strong interaction between the two; the reversing-\ncurrent ripples are only passively superimposed upon these larger oscillatory-\ncurrent ripples. We want to emphasize that a lot more work has to be done at rela-\ntively large orbital velocities and oscillation periods before these speculative re-\nlationships can be confirmed.\n3.3.3.6 Careful observations of oscillation ripples in the shallow oceans have\nrevealed the existence at moderate to large oscillation speeds and long oscillation\nperiods, in the upper right of Figure 2-63A, of only small 2D ripples, with\nspacings almost without exception in the range 0.07-0.08 m, rather than large\nthree-dimensional ripples. These small ripples are almost certainly reversing-\ncurrent ripples, described above. Why were large three-dimensional ripples not\nobserved? Was not enough time available as the oscillatory flow waned from\nplane-bed conditions? Or is there something inherent in oscillatory flow in a\nclosed flow duct that is conducive to their development? The ancient sedimentary\nrecord of shallow-marine environments gives incontrovertible evidence of large-\nscale three-dimensional oscillation ripples in fine sands, but we have no way of\nknowing whether the oscillatory flow was dominated by a single component or\nwas composed of a range of components with different periods, directions, and\namplitudes. Only observations of the bed configuration in the shallow ocean\nduring storms can resolve this question.\n3.3.3.7 Relationships of ripples in coarse sands, shown in Figure 2-63B, are\nsimpler than in fine sands. Ripple spacing again increases upward to the right,\nscaled closely to orbital diameter. Again the crude contours of equal ripple\nspacing seem to slope a little more steeply than the lines of constant orbital diam-\neter. Somewhat surprisingly, the lower boundary of the ripple field seems to be in\nabout the same position as for the much finer sands. All the ripples are two-\ndimensional oscillatory-current ripples; for reasons unclear, the instability leading\nto three-dimensional geometry in fine sands is not manifested in coarse sands.\nNeither are large three-dimensional oscillation ripples represented in the ancient\nsedimentary record.\n\n3 .3.4 Combined-Flow Bed Configurations\n3.3.4.1 So far we've looked at just the two \"end-member cases\" of flows that\nmake bed configurations. Even aside from the importance of time-varying uni-\ndirectional and oscillatory flows, and of purely oscillatory flows with more than\njust one back-and-forth oscillation component, there's a whole world of combined\nflows out there making their own bed configurations. Observations in the natural\nenvironment have been scarce, and systematic laboratory work is only now\nbeginning.\n\n3.3.4.2 Observations of combined-flow bed configurations are not yet at the\nstage where we can draw well organized graphs for you. Theoretically, we should\nbe dealing with a five-dimensional graph, made up with the variables sediment\nsize, unidirectional-flow velocity component, flow depth, oscillatory-flow velocity\ncomponent, and oscillation period. We would have great envy of anyone who can\nvisualize a four-dimensional graph as well as a three-dimensional graph, but we\ndon't know anybody who can. But matters are not as bad as they seem. For\noscillation-dominated flow we should be able to neglect the flow depth, because\neverything happens in an oscillatory-flow boundary layer within a meter or so\nabove the bottom whose thickness is limited (in ways we can't discuss here) by the\nnature of the oscillation itself. And in unidirectional-dominated flow we might be\nable to neglect the oscillation period.\n3.3.4.3 What little we know about combined-flow bed configurations is\nmostly from oscillation-dominated combined flow. We can handle the four vari-\nables by trying to plot a series of three-dimensional graphs for various values of\nthe fourth variable. At this stage, which one we choose as the fourth variable is\nirrelevant, because there's data only for one sediment size and one oscillation\nperiod! Figure 2-64, from experiments by Arnott and Southard in a combined-\nflow duct, shows a graph of oscillatory velocity component against unidirectional\nvelocity component for a sand size of about 0.1 mm and an oscillation period of\nabout 9 s.\n\nC\no\nm\nb\ni\nn\ne\nd\n-\nf\nl\no\nw\n\nb\ne\nd\n-configurations.\n\n3.3.4.4 The plot in Figure 2-64 is partitioned into fields for various in-\ntergradational bed phases. In the range of flows studied (oscillatory velocity 0-\n0.80 m/s; unidirectional velocity 0-0.25 m/s) these bed phases are: no movement;\nsmall two-dimensional ripples; small three-dimensional ripples; large three-\ndimensional ripples; and plane bed. The transitions among these bed phases are\ngradual; the partitioning is only an attempt to identify regions with distinctive bed\ngeometry, and is not meant to imply sharp distinctions among the various phases.\nBut the differences in bed configuration from region to region in Figure 2-64 are\nreal and substantial. In particular, the transition from small ripples to large ripples\nseems to represent a region of accelerated change in bed-form scale compared to\nregions above and below, where changes are slower although not negligible.\n3.3.4.5 The sequence of bed phases along the oscillatory axis is known from\nearlier work in the same flow duct using the same sediment size and oscillation\nperiod: no movement, small two-dimensional ripples, small three-dimensional\nripples, large three-dimensional ripples, plane bed. Likewise the sequence of bed\nphases along the unidirectional axis is well known from many studies in unidirec-\ntional flow: no movement, unidirectional-flow ripples, plane bed. In the interior\nof the graph, the boundary between no movement and combined-flow ripples is\nnot well constrained, and is shown arbitrarily as a straight line. The boundary\nbetween combined-flow ripples and plane bed, on the other hand, is fairly well\nconstrained: within the range of unidirectional flow velocities attainable, it falls\nsharply with increasing unidirectional velocity at first and then becomes nearly\nhorizontal.\n3.3.4.6 Over a narrow range of oscillatory velocities above threshold and for\nvery small unidirectional velocities, less than a few centimeters per second, the\nbed configuration consists of regular ripples with straight and laterally continuous\nsharp crests and broad troughs oriented perpendicular to the flow. Ripple profiles\nare only slightly asymmetrical. With only slight increase in either velocity\ncomponent the ripples become increasingly irregular in plan geometry. Rightward\nfrom the oscillatory axis, over the entire range of unidirectional velocities studied,\nthe configuration consists of relatively small ripples with more or less sinuous\nalthough fairly continuous crest lines and with more or less pronounced local lows\nor scour pits in troughs. Dips on the upstream and downstream ripple flanks are\nnot greatly different, but the lamination within the ripples always dips\ndownstream, because the ripples move slowly in the direction of the unidirectional\ncomponent. Even at small values of oscillatory velocity the overall appearance of\nthe ripples is not grossly different from those in purely unidirectional flows.\n3.3.4.7 As oscillatory velocity increases beyond about 0.4 m/s, the three-di-\nmensional ripples become much larger. The transition is gradual, but the rate of\nchange with increasing oscillatory velocity is greater than at smaller oscillatory\nvelocities. Bed-form crests become less continuous and more rounded, resulting\nin forms whose geometry could be described as hummocky. As spacing continues\nto increase to over 2 m at the highest values of oscillatory velocity, detailed\ninformation on plan geometry is lost owing to the narrowness of the flow duct\nused, although the ripples are still substantially three-dimensional. Except at the\ngreatest oscillatory velocities, small reversing-current ripples are prominently\nsuperimposed. With increasing unidirectional velocity the flow-parallel profiles\nof the three-dimensional ripples become more asymmetrical, eventually attaining\n\nlee-side angles of up to 25°. A unidirectional component of only a few centime-\nters per second is need to make the profiles noticeably asymmetrical. Heights first\nincrease with oscillatory velocity and then decrease in the transition to plane bed.\nSpacings are a large percentage of the orbital diameter, suggesting that these large\nthree-dimensional ripples are analogues of the oscillatory-current ripples well\nknown from oscillatory flows.\n3.3.4.8 These large three-dimensional combined-flow ripples must somehow\ndisappear with increasing unidirectional velocity, because in purely unidirectional\nflow small three-dimensional ripples pass into plane bed with increasing velocity,\nand the upper boundary of combined-flow ripples must connect with that\ntransition point on the unidirectional axis, as shown in Figure 2-65, which is a\nrather speculative extrapolation of Figure 2-64 to greater values of unidirectional\nvelocity. Also to be ascertained is the relationship between large combined-flow\nripples in very fine sand, like those described above, and dunes in purely\nunidirectional flow in sands coarser than about 0.2 mm. A whole series of\nintermediate \"sections\" in the four-dimensional graph of oscillatory velocity,\nunidirectional velocity, oscillation period, and sediment size must be explored to\nestablish this relationship, even for the simplest case of combined flow, in which\nthe oscillatory and unidirectional components are parallel.\n3.3.4.9 To summarize the first-order things about the combined-flow bed\nconfigurations shown in Figures 2-64 and 2-65, it's clear that it takes only a small\nunidirectional flow component to make oscillatory-flow bed forms noticeably\nasymmetrical, and that even a substantial (but subordinate) oscillatory flow\ndoesn't change unidirectional-flow bed forms very much. Also, there's clearly a\ncontinuous spectrum of small ripplelike bed configurations that stretches from\nunidirectional-flow ripples to small oscillatory-flow vortex ripples. The major\nproblems revolve around how (if in fact at all!) unidirectional-flow dunes connect\nwith the large 3D vortex ripples known to be produced by strong oscillatory flows\nat long oscillation periods.\n\nE\nx\nt\nr\na\np\no\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nof the combined-flow bed-configurations.\n\n3.4 Eolian Bed Configurations\n\n3.4.1 So far we've addressed only bed configurations formed in water flows.\nBed configurations produced by the wind are a prominent feature of the Earth's\nmodern surface, and by good evidence have been important at various times in the\ngeologic past.\n3.4.2 If we take the most general view in the context of the kinds of exis-\ntence diagrams described in the earlier sections of this chapter, we might imagine\ntrying to obtain the data to construct a four-dimensional graph with axes unidi-\nrectional flow velocity, flow depth, sediment size, and density ratio ρs/ρ, where\nremember ρs is the density of the sediment and ρ is the density of the fluid.\nProbably the best way to deal with such a four-dimensional graph is to picture it as\na series or continuum of three dimensional depth-velocity-size graphs as ρs/ρ\nvaries. Only two graphs out of this continuum are of very much interest to us,\nthough: those for quartz-density sand in water and for quartz-density sand in air.\nYou also have to sort of look past the awkwardness of not having a well defined\nflow depth to deal with in the first place in the case of sand in air.\n3.4.3 Everyone knows that there are two important eolian bed phases: rip-\nples and dunes. But be on your guard against assuming that, just because we use\nthe same terminology for these features as for ripples and dunes in unidirectional\nwater flows, the two sets of features are dynamically related! Unless someone\ncomes up with an incontrovertible theory for the existence and dynamics of dunes,\nthe only way we'll ever know this is to make a whole series of observations at\nintermediate values of the density ratio. (That would make a great thesis project\nfor somebody, wouldn't it?) Our own suspicion is that we would be able to trace\nthe continuous existence of dunes but not of ripples through the intermediate\nrange.\n3.4.4 The trouble with the organizedly empirical approach (which works so\nfruitfully for sand in water) in the case of sand in air is that we just don't know very\nmuch about the existence fields for eolian bed configurations, let alone how the\nsize and geometry of dunes varies within the existence field for dunes. Maybe\nsome of our eolian colleagues would take exception to that statement, but we think\nwe can defend it pretty well. Here are two factors we think are significant:\n\nθ Nowhere on Earth does the wind blow steadily for nearly a long enough\ntime to bring the bed configuration into equilibrium with the steady wind. There\nare, however, places like the Arabian Peninsula where the sand-moving winds\nblow mainly from the same direction but with time-varying velocity.\nθ There aren't many places on Earth where eolian bed configurations aren't\nstarved. (By starved we mean that the thickness of wind-movable sand is not\ngreat enough to prevent exposure of immovable substrate in the troughs of the bed\nforms.) Actually, that's true only of the larger bed forms, which are always called\ndunes; full-bed wind ripples are of course common, although starved wind ripples\nare important too.\n\n3.4.5 As far as we can tell, we don't even know whether eolian dunes are\nself-limiting in size or whether they would continue to grow in size given a long\nenough reach of full sand bed exposed to the wind. But we think that in practice\n\nthis is not a big issue, because in most situations dune size is limited either by\nstarvation or by limited reach length.\n3.4.6 Has it ever struck you that subaerial types never make duct experi-\nments on subaerial dunes the way the subaqueous types like us make flume ex-\nperiments on subaqueous dunes? What would we find if we built a gigantic\nquonset-hut racetrack duct on a full sand surface in the desert and ran a steady\nwind over the sand surface with an aircraft engine? we suspect that no matter how\nbig we built the duct, the dunes would grow to the point where further growth is\nimpeded by their feeling the roof. We could indeed make some interesting ob-\nservations on:\n\nθ dune development\nθ how the fully grown dunes vary in shape as a function of wind velocity\nθ the wind velocity needed to smooth out the dunes to a plane bed (not very\nrelevant to the Earth's surface, we suppose!)\n\n3.4.7 We think the bottom line here is that most of the emphasis we gave to\nthe existence, size, and geometry under steady, full-bed conditions in water flows\nis irrelevant to the real world of eolian bed forms and stratification. The geometry\nif not the scale of most real eolian dunes (which is what mainly determines the\nnature of eolian cross-stratification) is shaped mainly by the time history of wind\nspeed and direction in the dune field, which as we pointed out earlier ranges all\nover the place. This is what occupies a lot of the efforts of eolian researchers. We\nwon't try to summarize here what's known in this regard, partly because the\npossibilities are so varied but mainly because we're not an expert on such matters.\nEventually, though, we'll have to return to this difficulty when we deal with the\n\n3.5 A Note on Bed-Configuration Dynamics\n\n3.5.1 At first thought it might seem that the natural mode of transport would\nbe over a planar bed. In certain ranges of flow a planar transport surface is indeed\nthe stable bed configuration. Only in laminar flows, however, is this invariably so.\nYou've seen that in turbulent flows, plane-bed transport is the stable configuration\nunder certain conditions, but bed forms are the dominant transport surface in both\noscillatory and unidirectional flows. This must mean that over a wide range of\nflows and sediment sizes a planar transport surface is unstable to small\nperturbations, and otherwise insignificant geometrical irregularities, either\npreexisting or flow-generated, are amplified to become bed forms.\n3.5.2 Can theories be developed to account for the existence and range of\noccurrence of the bed configurations we observe? A time-honored way of de-\nveloping theories for such phenomena is to make a stability analysis: write down\nwhat you think is the governing equation of motion (or, in the case of sediment-\ntransporting turbulent flows, some workable approximation thereto), and then\nintroduce a small-amplitude perturbation to the planar bed and see whether the\nperturbation is damped out with time (indicating that the plane bed is the stable\nconfiguration) or whether the perturbation is amplified with time (indicating that\nrugged bed forms are destined to develop). In the latter case, you can also try to\nsee which wavelength of disturbance grows the fastest, thus presumably indicating\nthe scale of the resulting bed forms.\n\n3.5.3 There's been some modest success with such stability analyses, but\nthere are lots of difficulties. As the flow molds the bed by erosion and deposition,\nthe bed geometry thus generated changes the structure of the flow itself in\nfundamental ways that are difficult to build into mathematical models. There is\nthus a strong interaction or feedback between the bed and the flow; this essential\nelement of complexity has hindered the development of theory. Another problem\nis that even if the stability analysis is successful, it says nothing about the finite-\namplitude effects that are really important in shaping the growing bed forms.\n\n4. DEPOSITION\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\n4.1.1 The topic of deposition is obviously an important one, because every\nsedimentary sequence was deposited somehow. This section is meant to serve as a\nframework for trying to make interpretations about deposition from the evidence\nof beds in a sedimentary section in the final section.\n4.1.2 Let us pose a question for you: \"Why does deposition happen?\" We\nwonder whether this strikes you as a trivial question or as a difficult question. In\none sense, we can supply a simple answer: sediment is carried by a flow, and\nwhen the conditions are such that the flow becomes overloaded, the sediment is\ndeposited. But in another sense, this is a superficial answer, because it doesn't ac-\ncount for the conditions under which a flow becomes overloaded, and we have to\nlook for a more fundamental answer.\n4.1.3 The most straightforward process involved in deposition is settling:\nthe downward fall of sediment particles through the surrounding fluid by the pull\nof gravity. But keep in mind that there's far more to deposition than just settling of\nsediment particles: you have to worry about where the sediment came from, how\nit got to the site of deposition, and how it was deposited at the site of deposition.\n\n4.2 Modes of Deposition\n\n4.2.1 Introduction\n\n4.2.1.1 This subsection examines local modes of sediment deposition. Some\nof these modes may be observable in laboratory experiments or in field studies.\nOthers may be difficult or impossible to observe with present technology, and we\ncan only make deductions or speculations about them. (Keep in mind that deduc-\ntions can be very dangerous in physical sedimentology, because the physics of the\nphenomena are so complex that we can easily fool ourselves into thinking that an\nunimportant process is important or that an important process is unimportant.)\nThe treatment will be entirely qualitative.\n4.2.1.2 Several distinctive modes of deposition, discussed in the subsections\nbelow, can be recognized. These modes grade into one another; there are no sharp\nboundaries among the various processes involved. Keep in mind also that the\nterms used for these modes are only unofficial; you won't find them in the pub-\nlished literature on sediment deposition. See Figure 2-66 for cartoons that illus-\ntrate the various modes of deposition.\n\n4 .2.2 Fallout Without Traction\n4.2.2.1 In the simplest of depositional modes, sediment particles suspended\nin a flow by some earlier process or event settle to the bed and are not transported\nthereafter, either by traction or by suspension (Figure 2-66A). This might be\ncalled fallout without traction.\n\nM\no\nd\ne\ns\n\no\nf\n\nd\ne\np\no\ns\ni\nt\ni\no\nn\n.\n\n4.2.2.2 Flows that deposit sediment by fallout without traction have ve-\nlocities below the threshold for bed-load transport, which ranges from slightly less\nthan 0.2 m/s to well over 0.3 m/s, depending on the depth of the flow and the size\nof the sediment particles. In general, the weaker the flow, the finer the sediment\nbeing carried and deposited in this mode. The flow may even be nonexistent; in\nthat case, the sediment must be supplied directly from above, as for example by\nfallout of eolian sediment into a standing body of water.\n4.2.2.3 The size of the sediment deposited by fallout without traction is usu-\nally very fine, seldom coarser than very fine sand. The reason is that the flow\nwould need to be much stronger to carry coarser sediment in suspension, and such\nflows would be strong enough to move the deposited sediment as bed load after\nthe sediment lands on the bed.\n4 .2.3 Fallout With Traction\n4.2.3.1 Sediment particles may settle onto the sediment bed from suspension\nand then be moved as bed load, or even resuspended temporarily, before they\neventually come to permanent rest and are buried by other particles as the bed\nbuilds up (Figure 2-66B). This might be called fallout with traction.\n4.2.3.2 Flows that deposit sediment by fallout with traction can have a wide\nrange of velocities, from a small fraction of a meter per second to much greater\nthan a few meters per second. Sediment size can range from silts to gravels. The\nonly condition is that the flow is not so overloaded with suspended sediment that a\nwell defined sediment-water interface cannot be maintained.\n4 .2.4 Differential Transport\n4.2.4.1 A sediment deposit can be formed without any fallout from suspen-\nsion. At first thought this might seem strange, so we need to spend a little more\ntime discussing this mode of deposition. Think about the consequences of a\ndownstream change in sediment transport rate in a steady flow.\n4.2.4.2 Look at a small rectangular reference area on the sediment bed be-\nneath a flow that's transporting sediment over the bed (Figure 2-67). The edges of\nthe reference area are parallel to and perpendicular to the flow direction. Since\nvolume of sediment is neither created nor destroyed on the short time scales\nassociated with sediment transport by traction or suspension, we can invoke the\nprinciple of conservation of sediment volume in accounting for what happens to\nthe sediment.\n\nA\n\nr\ne\nf\ne\nr\ne\nn\nc\ne area on the sediment bed.\n\n4.2.4.3 If the total volume of sediment in traction and suspension passing\nacross the plane extending upward from the upstream edge of the reference area is\nless than the total volume of sediment passing across the plane extending upward\nfrom the downstream edge of the reference area (Figure 2-68A), then sediment is\nsomehow being added to the flow in the space above the reference area. The only\nplace where that added sediment can come from is from the bed, and the only\nplace where it can go is into the flow. So there must be net erosion of the bed.\n\nS\ne\nd\ni\nm\ne\nn\nt\n\nt\nr\na\nn\ns\np\no\nr\nt\n\no\nv\ner the reference area.\n\n4.2.4.4 On the other hand, if the total volume of sediment in traction and sus-\npension passing across the upstream plane is greater than the total volume passing\nacross the downstream plane (Figure 2-68B), then sediment is somehow being\nextracted from the flow in the space over the reference area. The only place\nwhere that extracted sediment can go is onto the bed, so there has to be net\ndeposition on the bed. This mode of deposition might be called deposition by\ndifferential transport (Figure 2-66C).\n4.2.4.5 The consequence of the reasoning presented above is that there can\nbe deposition on a sediment bed without any temporal change in the picture of\nsediment transport: the flow is steady, and the load and the sediment transport\nrate at every point does not change with time. There can be deposition, however,\nprovided that the sediment transport rate is changing spatially by decreasing in the\ndownstream direction.\n4.2.4.6 Deposition by differential transport can take place entirely by down-\nstream decrease in bed-load transport rate, even without any suspended sediment\nin the flow. This happens wherever the flow deepens slightly in the downstream\ndirection (for any one or more of several reasons, which we won't discuss here),\ncausing the flow velocity and therefore also the bed-load sediment transport rate to\ndecrease in the downstream direction.\n4.2.4.7 Flows that deposit sediment by differential transport range widely in\nflow velocity, from a few tenths of a meter per second to well over two meters per\nsecond. Sediment size ranges from finer than sand size to well into the gravel\nsize. Clearly, the coarser the sediment the more likely it is that the process\ninvolves differential bed-load transport rather than differential suspended-load\ntransport.\n\n4 .2.5 Mass Deposition\n4.2.5.1 When the region of the flow near the bed is overloaded with a high\nconcentration of suspended sediment, the sediment settles to the bed with little\nspace between adjacent sediment particles, and a layer of the flow with a thickness\nthat's orders of magnitude greater than the particle size becomes immobilized\nalmost simultaneously as the shearing of the highly concentrated sediment-water\nmixture ceases (Figure 2-66D). Such a mode of deposition might be called mass\ndeposition.\n4.2.5.2 During mass deposition there's no well defined sediment-water inter-\nface; instead there's a gradual transition between the underlying already-deposited\nbed and the sheared, highly concentrated suspension above. Another way of\nlooking at this is that the pore-water content of the mixture varies continuously\nupward from the already-deposited sediment bed into the still-moving sediment-\nwater mixture.\n4.2.5.3 Conditions during mass deposition are difficult to observe, because\nthe sediment concentrations are high and deposition is rapid. Also, the flows from\nwhich mass deposition occurs tend to be more powerful and on much larger scales\nthan is the case with the other modes of deposition discussed above. Mass\ndeposition is characteristic of strong sediment gravity flows, especially in their\nearlier stages.\n\n4.3 The Relationship between the Load and the Deposit\n\n4.3.1 This subsection makes some fundamental points about the relationship\nbetween the sediment load and the deposit in a depositing flow. We think this\nmaterial is fundamental to understanding the texture of a deposit, although it won't\ntell you anything really practical.\n\n4.3.2 Obviously, whenever a deposit is being formed by a sediment-\ntransporting flow, some percentage of the sediment load is being extracted from\nthe flow and added to the bed, by one or more of the various processes discussed\nin the previous section. The ratio of sediment extraction to sediment passage or\nthroughput can range from nearly zero, in the case of an almost uniform flow\ncarrying fairly high concentrations of sediment in an almost nondepositional\nregime, to one hundred percent, when a flow dumps all its sediment in one place,\nlike certain kinds of debris flows. Just for convenience, we'll unofficially call this\nratio the deposition ratio. (Don't worry about how this ratio could be defined\nquantitatively.) Although you can't read the value of the deposition ratio directly\nfrom beds in an outcrop, we think it's one more of those things that are useful to\nthink about as an aid in framing your interpretations.\n\n4.3.3 This section deals with the relationship between the characteristics of\nthe sediment load and the characteristics of the deposit left by the flow. The sedi-\nment load always has some joint probability distribution of particle size, particle\nshape, and particle density (Figure 2-69). You can never really characterize this\ndistribution fully, even when you can obtain a good representative sample of the\nload, mainly because of the problem of the infinite variations in particle shape, but\nit's nonetheless real and important. When deposition takes place, some subset of\nthe passing particles are selected from the flow to become part of the permanent\ndeposit left behind by the flow. Here's what we consider to be the most\nfundamental question of sediment deposition: How does the nature of the\ndeposit depend upon the flow and the nature of the load? If sedimentologists\nare ever going to be able to make interpretations about depositional conditions by\nexamining the texture of the deposit, they are going to have to answer this\nquestion first.\n\nP\nr\no\nb\na\nb\ni\nl\ni\nt\ny\n\ndistribution.\n\n4.3.4 There's more to the selection process than might seem to you at first\nthought. First we'd like to divide the sediment bed into two depth zones (Figure\n2-70). The uppermost zone, extending some distance down from the bed surface,\nis called the active layer. The sediment in the active layer is subjected to repeated\nreentrainment by the flow as the bed elevation at any given point rises and falls as\na result of local erosion and deposition that's superimposed on the long-term net\ndeposition. A good example of such temporary changes in bed elevation are those\nassociated with the passage of bed forms. All the sediment within the active layer\nwill be recycled by the flow at least once by the flow before it's permanently\nburied. Below the active layer is the permanent deposit. The sediment in the\npermanent deposit is below the reach of the local erosional processes of the flow,\nand it will never again be entrained by the flow (unless the overall depositional\nregime changes into an overall erosional regime at some later time).\n\nA\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n\nl\na\ny\ne\nr\nabove the permanent deposit.\n\n4.3.5 The thickness of the active layer may range from just one or two grain\ndiameters, on an approximately planar bed undergoing aggradation, to many\nmeters, when the bed is covered with very large bed forms that deposit and\nreerode sediment as they move downstream.\n4.3.6 When viewed in terms of the active layer, deposition therefore involves\nthe burial of certain particles deeply enough within the active layer so that they\nare no longer moved by the flow again, so that they become part of the permanent\ndeposit.\n4.3.7 Since only a subset of the particles of the load end up becoming part of\nthe permanent deposit, there's the possibility of fractionation of the various size,\nshape, and density fractions between the load and the deposit. Obviously, such\nfractionation can take place only if there's some range of sizes, shapes, or densities\nin the load in the first place. But all natural sediments show at least some varia-\ntion in size and shape.\n4.3.8 Here's an important question for you. Think about the ratio between\nthe mean size of the load and the mean size of the deposit. As the flow strength\nincreases, does this ratio increase or decrease? In other words, if other factors\nremain the same, does the deposit become coarser or finer as the flow\nstrength increases? We expect to fool you with this question! We fooled\nourselves recently when we did a laboratory research project on deposition from\nstrong flows carrying coarse and poorly sorted sediments. One's first reaction is\nthat the stronger the flow, the coarser the deposit. But just the opposite is true!\n4.3.9 In the strongest flows, with high concentrations of sediment traveling\nboth as bed load and suspended load, the coarser particles less commonly find\npermanent resting places on the bed, so the deposit is much finer than the load. In\nweaker flows, on the other hand, under conditions not far above the threshold for\nparticle transport, the mean size of the deposit is about the same as the mean size\nof the load. Here's yet another example of how deduction or intuition can mislead\nyou when it comes to the dynamics of sediment transport by turbulent flows.\n4.3.10 We think it's premature for us to try to draw useful conclusions for\nyou about the relationship between the load, the flow, and the deposit. But we\n\nwant you to be aware of the importance of such knowledge. As more work is\ndone on deposition of mixed-size sediment, there's a good chance of obtaining\nsome results that will be really useful in paleoflow interpretations."

This is a singularly unilluminating definition, be-\ncause it doesn't conjure up in the mind of the uninitiated any of the great variety of\ninteresting and significant geometries that get produced by the physical, chemical,\nand biological processes that operate on sediments during and after their deposi-\ntion.\n1.2 One qualification to the foregoing definition is that the term structure is\nused in two different senses:\n\nθ For features, on the scale of hand specimens to large outcrops, produced\nwithin a depositional environment, during or (usually) not long after de-\nposition. These are usually prefaced by the adjective sedimentary.\nθ For features, on the scale of hand specimens to whole regions, produced by\ndeformation associated with regional rather than local deforming forces,\nfolding and faulting being perhaps the most obvious examples. This stuff is\nnot the province of sedimentologists or stratigraphers, although they have to\nbe prepared to deal with it. These could be prefaced with the adjective\ntectonic.\n\n1.3 Study of sedimentary structures is important because they are far and\naway the most valuable features for interpreting depositional environment. We\nknow a lot about how most structures are formed, so finding them in the rocks can\ntell you a lot about the conditions of deposition. They're much more useful than\ntextural things like grain-size distribution and grain shape.\n\n2. CLASSIFICATION\n\n2.1 It's not easy to classify sedimentary structures, because both their origins\nand their geometries are so highly varied. Two reasonable ways of classifying\nthem are on the basis of: kind of mechanism that produces them (physical\nsedimentary structures, chemical sedimentary structures, and biogenic sedi-\nmentary structures) and time of development relative to time of deposition\n(primary sedimentary structures and secondary sedimentary structures).\n2.2 Figure 3-1 is a pigeonhole chart showing most of the important struc-\ntures in terms of such a twofold classification.\n\nC\nl\na\ns\ns\ni\nf\ni\nc\na\nt\ni\non of sedimentary structures.\n\n2.3 Physical primary structures are certainly the most common and\nwidespread and striking, and I think it's fair to say that in general they're the most\nuseful in interpretation. Most are related to transportation and deposition of sedi-\nment particles at a fluid/sediment interface. Such structures can be classified\nfurther on the basis of their relationship to transportation (the movement of\nsediment past a point on a sediment bed by currents) and deposition (the increase\nin bed elevation at a point with time). Figure 3-2 is an unofficial classification of\nthis kind. It doesn't serve very well as a catalogue, but it should help to get your\nthinking organized.\n\nC\nl\na\ns\ns\ni\nf\ni\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn of primary sedimentary structures.\n\n3. STRATIFICATION\n\n3.1 General\n\n3.1.1 Stratification is by far the most important sedimentary structure.\nMost, although not all, sedimentary rocks are stratified in one way or another.\nThere are many scales and geometries of stratification. And stratification is\ncertainly the single most useful aspect of sedimentary rocks in terms of interpret-\ning depositional conditions.\n3.1.2 Stratification can be defined simply as layering brought about by\ndeposition, the term layering being more generally used for any arrangement of\nrocks in bodies with approximately planar-tabular shape. I suppose it's obvious,\nbut I'll say it anyway: stratification comes about by changes in depositional\nconditions with time.\n3.1.3 In dealing with stratification, there are two separate but related matters\nyou have to worry about:\n\nθ What it was about depositional conditions that changed with time to give rise\nto stratification?\nθ What it is about the rock itself that makes the stratification manifest?\n(Changes in composition, texture, or even other smaller-scale structures?)\n\n3.1.4 Stratification is usually obvious, especially on the scale of large\noutcrops, but sometimes it's subtle and hard to find, either because depositional\nconditions didn't vary much or because the rocks have been messed up since, or\nperhaps just because the outcrop is inadequate. Finding the stratification under\nsuch conditions is a skill that has to be sharpened by practice.\n3.1.5 In looking for the stratification, always think in terms of changes in\ncomposition, texture, and/or structure from bed to bed. Failing that, look for\npreferred orientation of clasts, which although not stratification in itself, often\nreveals the stratification.\n3.1.6 Here's a list of things that tend to make stratification apparent to the\neye:\nθ obvious differences in grain size\nθ obvious differences in composition\nθ color/shade differences caused by slight differences in composition (subtle\ndifferences in underlying composition can cause even greater color/shade\ndifferences as large ones);\nθ differential weathering caused by differences in composition/texture; these\nrange from gross to subtle;\nθ zones of larger or smaller concentration of individual components, like\npebbles or fossils in otherwise homogeneous sediment;\nθ preferred orientation of nonspherical components (technically not stratifi-\ncation itself, but it can reveal the stratification; often useful in unstratified\nconglomerates)\n\n3.2 Terminology\n\n3.2.1 Stratification is officially subdivided into bedding and lamination, de-\npending upon the thickness of the strata, and bedding and lamination are in turn\nsubdivided according to thickness. Figure 3-3 is a chart that gives you all the\nofficial terminology. Get used to using this terminology in your descriptions of\nstrata.\nTerminology for thickness of strata.\n\n3.2.2 With that said, I suppose I should point out that in everyday sedimen-\ntological and stratigraphic usage, people commonly use the term bedding as a\nsynonym for stratification rather than just in its technically restricted sense.\n3.2.3 Also, stratification is often hierarchical, in that beds commonly show\ninternal lamination on a much finer scale.\n3.2.4 One of our little terminological peeves is that people sometimes use the\nterm lamination not just for the phenomenon but for the object, instead of lamina.\nThat's not good practice, and I want you to avoid it. It makes you sound\nuncultured.\n\n3.3 Parting\n\n3.3.1 Keep clearly in mind the distinction between stratification and parting.\nParting is the tendency for stratified rocks to split evenly along certain stratifi-\ncation planes. (The word is also used for the plane itself along which parting has\ndeveloped.) The approximately planar-tabular units developed by parting are\nusually just called beds, but it might be better to think of them as parting units.\n3.3.2 There's official terminology for parting units, corresponding to that for\nstratification, although it's not in as common use; see Figure 3-4.\n\nTerminology for parting units.\n\n3.3.3 The problem with making a big deal of parting is that it depends not\nonly upon the underlying existence of weaker bedding planes but also upon the\nextent and nature of weathering: A freshly blasted outcrop usually won't show\nany parting at all, but if you go back to the outcrop years or decades later, it might\nshow well developed parting.\n\n3.4 Origin\n\n3.4.1 Here are three major \"scenarios\" for the origin of stratification. These\nare the broad ways loose sediments get deposited.\n3.4.2 Quiet-fluid deposition of particles by settling: ocean bottom (plus\nlakes) mainly; low-velocity currents carrying a supply of suspended sediment\nfrom upcurrent; usually fine-grained but not always; usually thin lamination,\nbecause deposition rate is slow relative to the slight changes in settling regime;\nusually nearly or perfectly even and planar, unless later deformed. Often such\ndeposits are later bioturbated to the point that none of the original lamination\nremains.\n3.4.3 Deposition of particles by tractional currents: deposition onto a\nwell defined fluid-sediment interface during bed-load (or bed-load plus plus sus-\npended-load) transport by moderate to strong currents; stratification thick to thin\ndepending on nature of variations in sediment supply, currents, and deposition\nrate; even stratification and cross stratification can both be important; usually\nfairly coarse sediment, coarsest silt size into gravel range.\n3.4.4 Mass deposition of coarse and fine sediment mixtures (or only fine\nsediment, or rarely only coarse sediment) by sediment gravity flows (high-\nconcentration sediment-water mixtures flowing as a single fluid) coming to rest\nwithout differentiation or particle-by-particle deposition; usually thick-bedded,\nwith little or no internal stratification.\n\n4. CROSS STRATIFICATION\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\n4.1.1 Cross stratification is stratification that is locally at some angle to the\noverall stratification as a consequence of changes in the geometry of the deposi-\ntional surface during deposition. (This definition leaves some uncertainty about\nwhat's meant by the scales of \"local\" and \"overall\". Usually \"local\" is on lateral\nscales ranging from centimeters to hundreds of meters.) Usually one or more beds\nin some part of a section show cross stratification, which you recognize as cross\nstratification because the attitude of the stratification varies from point to point\nwithin the beds, or, if it's the same everywhere within those beds, then you can see\nthat the orientation is different from that of the bounding surfaces of the beds, or\nthe orientation is different from what you know to be the overall stratification\nwithin the outcrop or within the local stratigraphic section.\n4.1.2 The vertical scale of cross stratification varies from millimeters to sev-\neral meters, and the geometry is infinitely varied. Cross stratification comes about\nby deposition upon a sediment surface that is locally at an angle to the overall\nplane of the depositional surface; this usually but not always involves erosion of\nthe depositional surface as well, either prior to or concurrent with deposition.\nSome terminology: small-scale cross stratification is on scales of up to several\ncentimeters, medium-scale cross stratification is on scales from several\ncentimeters to several decimeters, and large-scale cross stratification is on scales\nfrom several decimeters to several meters. (But as far as I know, there's nothing\nofficial or standardized about these boundaries.)\n4.1.3 Cross stratification varies enormously in geometry. This is in part a\nreflection of the great diversity of bed configurations produced by fluid flows over\nloose beds of sediment. But there's an additional factor at work here too: some\ncross stratification comes about not from the movement of individual bed forms in\na train, but from solitary or isolated flow-produced topographical elements,\nusually large, which usually come under the heading of bars or deltas.\n4.1.4 Interpretation of cross stratification is well advanced, thanks to decades\nof careful field studies of cross-stratification geometry in ancient rocks, studies of\nmodern depositional environments, and laboratory studies in tanks and channels.\nSo cross stratification is probably the single most useful tool in interpreting the\nphysical aspects of loose-sediment depositional environments. That's why I'm\ndevoting what probably will seem to you to be inordinate space in these notes.\n(Another reason is that cross stratification is one of our own special fields!)\n4.1.5 Because cross stratification is so environment-specific, it seems best to\ngive you only a minimum of purely descriptive terminology and classification. I\nthink it's better for you to get used to the various \"styles\" of cross stratification,\nwhich are closely bound up with mechanics of origin, and then deal with examples\nin the context of these styles. That's the way things tend to be done these days by\nthe people who actually work on cross-stratified rocks.\n4.1.6 Here's some geometrical terminology. More commonly than not,\ncross-stratified deposits are arranged as packets or sets of conformable laminae\nseparated from adjacent sets by truncation surfaces. A set (also called a\nlaminaset) is a succession of two or more conformable laminae separated from\nother sets (or beds without sets) by surfaces of erosion, nondeposition, or abrupt\n\nchange in lithology. Figure 3-5 shows three common examples. In each example,\nthe asterisk lies within a single set. The laminae within the sets may be planar or\ncurving. Concave-up laminae are more common than convex-up laminae. The\norientations of the truncation surfaces are usually different from the orientations of\nthe laminae within the sets. Commonly the lateral scale of the sets may be not\nmuch greater than the vertical scale, or it may be much greater. In some cases,\nthere are no truncation surfaces within the cross-stratified deposit; Figure 3-6\nshows a common example.\n\nT\nh\nr\ne\ne\n\nc\nommon examples of sets.\n\nA\n\nc\no\nm\nm\no\nn\n\ne\nx\na\nmple of a cross-stratified deposit.\n\n4.1.7 Another thing you should be thinking about is one's view of cross\nstratification. Usually it's seen on a fracture surface, weathered or unweathered,\nnearly normal to the overall stratification. Some cross stratification is approxi-\nmately isotropic with respect to direction in the plane of overall stratification (the\ngeometry of cross stratification looks about the same in differently oriented sec-\ntions), but most is anisotropic (the geometry of cross stratification commonly\nlooks different in differently oriented sections normal to the overall plane of\n\nstratification), so try to see the cross stratification on as many differently oriented\nplanes normal to bedding as you can, because it might look quite different\ndepending on the direction. Sometimes, but not often, you get to see what the\ncross stratification looks like on a plane within the cross-stratified bed parallel to\noverall stratification.\n4.1.8 A final note on terminology: just as with stratification in general, you\ncan think in terms of cross stratification as the general term, and cross-bedding\nand cross-lamination according to the thickness of the strata within the sets.\nPeople tend not to adhere rigorously to these distinctions, however.\n4.1.9 Often a given cross-stratified bed may represent not just one deposi-\ntional event but two or more separate depositional events, each one superimposed\non the the previous one. Such beds are said to be amalgamated. Sometimes it's\neasy to recognize the individual depositional events within the amalgamated bed;\nthe stratification within each part of the bed can then be studied separately. But\nsometimes it's difficult to determine whether or not the bed is amalgamated.\n\n4.2 How Bed Forms Make Cross stratification\n\n4.2.1 In general terms, the fundamental idea about bed-form-generated cross\nstratification is easy to state (Figure 3-7): as bed forms of one kind or other pass a\ngiven point on the bed, both the bed elevation and the local bed slope change with\ntime. Consider a short time interval during the history of decrease and increase in\nbed elevation. After a temporary minimum in bed elevation is reached, deposition\nof new laminae takes place for a period of time, until a temporary maximum in\nbed elevation is reached. Then, as the bed elevation decreases again, there's\ncomplete or partial erosion of the newly deposited laminae and formation of a new\ntruncation surface. After the next minimum in bed elevation, another set of\nlaminae is deposited.\n\nT\nh\ne\n\nf\nu\nn\nd\na¬mental idea about cross stratification.\n\n4.2.2 The preceding paragraph is still too general to give you a concrete idea\nabout how moving bed forms generate cross stratification. Now I'll be more spe-\ncific. Take as an example a train of downstream-moving ripples in unidirectional\nflow. (The picture would be qualitatively very similar for dunes.) Each ripple\nmoves slowly downstream, generally changing in size and shape as it moves.\n\nSediment is stripped from the upstream (stoss) surface of each ripple and\ndeposited on the downstream (lee) surface.\n4.2.3 In your imagination, cut the train of ripples by a large number of verti-\ncal sections parallel to the mean flow direction (Figure 3-8). The trough of a\nripple is best defined by the curve formed by connecting all of the low points on\nthese vertical sections where they cut the given trough (Figure 3-9). This curve,\nwhich I'll unofficially call the low-point curve, is generally sinuous in three\ndimensions. The low-point curve moves downstream with the ripples, and it\nchanges its shape as it moves, like a writhing dragon, because trough depths and\nripple speeds change with time.\nCutting the train of ripples by verti¬cal sections.\n\nThe trough of a ripple.\n\n4.2.4 As the low-point curve shifts downstream, it can be viewed as having\nthe effect of a cheese-slicing wire: it seems to shave off the body of the ripple\nimmediately downstream for removal by erosion, and in that way it prepares an\nundulating floor or surface for the deposition of advancing foresets by the ripple\nimmediately upstream.\n4.2.5 Depending on flow conditions and sediment size, the foreset laminae\nlaid down by an advancing ripple vary widely in shape, from almost perfect planes\nsloping at the angle of repose to sigmoidal curves that meet the surface of the\ntrough downstream at a small angle (Figure 3-10). But whatever their shape, these\nlaminae are always deposited directly on the erosion surface that's formed (as just\ndescribed above) by the downstream movement of the ripple trough into which the\nforesets prograde.\n\nG\ne\no\nm\ne\ntries of foreset laminae.\n\n4.2.6 If no new sediment is added to the bed while the ripples move, the\naverage bed elevation doesn't change with time, and the invisible plane that repre-\nsents the average bed surface stays at the same elevation. On the average, the\nforesets deposited by a given ripple are entirely eroded away again as the next\ntrough upstream passes by (Figure 3-11). But if new sediment is added every-\nwhere to build the bed upward, the ripples no longer move parallel to the plane of\nthe average bed surface but instead have a component of upward movement\n(Figure 3-12). The resultant direction of ripple movement is described by the\nangle of climb, denoted by θ in Figure 3-12. The tangent of θ is equal to the\naverage rate of bed aggradation divided by the ripple speed.\n\nThe fore¬sets de¬posited by a given ripple eroded away.\n\nClimb of ripplelike bed forms.\n\n4.2.7 As the ripples climb in space, as described above, their troughs climb\nwith them. So the erosion surface associated with the downstream movement of\nthe low-point curve in a given trough passes above the erosion surface that was\nformed when the preceding trough passed by. The lowest parts of the foresets\ndeposited by the ripple that was located between those two troughs are then pre-\nserved rather than eroded entirely (Figure 3-13). This remnant set is bounded\nboth above and below by erosion surfaces.\n\nP\na\nr\nt\ni\nc\nl\ne\npreservation of ripple foresets.\n\n4.2.8 Figure 3-14 shows cross stratification in an ideally regular deposit\nproduced by low-angle climb of a train of ripples. The heavy lines are erosion\nsurfaces, and the light lines are foreset laminae. The profile of the ripple train as it\nexisted at a given time is shown also. The upper parts of each ripple in the train,\nunderneath the dashed part of the profile, were eliminated by later erosion. In real\ncross-stratified deposits of this kind, the erosion surfaces are irregularly sinuous\nbecause trough geometry changes with time, and the sets tend to pinch out both\nupstream and downstream because the ripples exist for only a finite distance of\nmovement.\n\nE\nr\no\ns\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n-\nstoss climbing-ripple cross-stratification.\n\n4.2.9 It's significant that what's most important in determining the geometry\nof this kind of cross stratification is the geometry of the bed forms in the troughs,\nnot near the crests. I should also point out that the height of the sets is always less\nthan the height of the bed forms that were responsible for the cross stratification.\nIf you compare the height of the cross-sets with the height of the ripples in the\ndashed profile in Figure 3-14, you can see that for low angles of climb, the set\nheight is only a small fraction of the bed-form height.\n\n4.2.10 The larger the angle of climb, the greater the fraction of foresets\npreserved. If the angle of climb of the ripples is greater than the slope angle of the\nstoss side of the ripples, then laminae are preserved on the stoss sides as well as\non the lee sides, and the full profile of the ripple is preserved (Figure 3-15). This\nhappens when the rate of addition of new sediment to the bed is greater than the\nrate at which sediment is transported from the stoss side to the lee side of the\nripple. The differences in geometry between Figure 3-14 and Figure 3-15 seem\ngreat, but keep in mind that the differences in environmental conditions are not\nlarge. The only difference is in the value of the angle of climb.\n\nDepositional-stoss climbing-ripple cross-stratification.\n\n4.2.11 The lamination produced when ripples move with a positive angle of\nclimb is called climbing-ripple cross stratification. Examples with angle of climb\nso small that the contacts between sets are erosional (as in Figure 3-14) might be\ncalled erosional-stoss climbing-ripple cross stratification, and examples with\nangle of climb large enough for preservation of the full ripple profile (as in Figure\n3-15) might be called depositional-stoss climbing-ripple cross stratification.\n4.2.12 To recapitulate the important points in this section: cross\nstratification is formed by the erosion and deposition associated with a train of bed\nforms as the average bed elevation increases by net addition of sediment to some\narea of the bed. The angle of climb of the ripples depends on the ratio of rate of\nbed aggradation to speed of ripple movement. At high angles of climb, the entire\nripple profile is preserved, and there are no erosion surfaces in the deposit. At low\nangles of climb, only the lower parts of foreset deposits are preserved, and the\n\nindividual sets are bounded by erosion surfaces. The general nature of such\nstratification is common to moving bed forms of all sizes, from small current\nripples to extremely large subaqueous or eolian dunes. Important differences in\nthe details of stratification geometry arise from differences in bed-form geometry\nand how it changes with time.\n\n4.3 Important Kinds of Cross stratification\n\n4 .3.1 Introduction\n4.3.1.1 Here I'll present the substance of what the major kinds of cross\nstratification in the sedimentary record look like. They conveniently fall into (i)\nunidirectional-flow cross stratification, on a small scale corresponding to ripples\nand on a larger scale corresponding to dunes, and (ii) oscillatory-flow cross\nstratification. Unfortunately there's little I can say at present about combined-\nflow cross stratification. I'll make a few comments about that in the section on\noscillatory-flow cross stratification.\n\n4 .3.2 Small-Scale Cross stratification in Unidirectional Flow\n4.3.2.1 Small-scale cross stratification formed under unidirectional flow is\nassociated almost entirely with the downstream movement of current ripples. In\naccordance with the discussion of how moving bed forms produce cross-stratified\ndeposits, discussed above, the general features of the cross-stratification geometry\ndepend on (i) the geometry of the ripples themselves, as well as how that geometry\nchanges with time as the ripples move, and (ii) the angle of climb.\n4.3.2.2 For small angles of climb, the general geometry of the cross-strati-\nfied deposit is shown by the block diagram in Figure 3-16. In addition to the\nactual rippled surface, Figure 3-16 shows a flow-parallel section and a flow-\ntransverse section perpendicular to the overall bedding. Figure 3-16 is the real-life\ncounterpart of Figure 3-14.\n\nC\nl\ni\nm\nb\ni\nn\ng\n-\nripple cross-stratification at small angles of climb.\n\n4.3.2.3 In sections parallel to flow (Figure 3-16) you see sets of laminae dip-\nping mostly or entirely in the same direction (which is the flow direction), sepa-\n\nrated by truncation surfaces. The height of the sets is seldom greater than 2-3 cm,\nbecause it's always some fraction of the ripple height, which itself is seldom\ngreater than 2-3 cm. The set boundaries are sinuous and irregular, because of the\nchanges in the ripples as they move. Sets are commonly cut out at some point in\nthe downstream direction by the overlying truncation surface. This is a reflection\nof either (i) locally stronger erosion by a passing ripple trough or (ii) disappear-\nance of a given ripple as it moved downstream, by being overtaken or absorbed by\nanother faster-moving ripple from upstream. New sets also appear in the down-\nstream direction, reflecting the birth of a new ripple in the train of ripples.\n4.3.2.4 In sections transverse to flow, the geometry of cross stratification is\nrather different (Figure 3-16): you see nested and interleaved sets whose lateral\ndimensions are usually less than something like five times the vertical dimension.\nEach set is truncated by one or more truncation surfaces. These truncation\nsurfaces are mostly concave upward. The laminae within each set are also mostly\nconcave upward, but the truncation surfaces generally cut the laminae discor-\ndantly.\n4.3.2.5 The key to understanding this cross-stratification geometry lies in the\ngeometry of ripple troughs. Remember that fully developed current ripples have\nstrongly three-dimensional geometry, and an important element of that three-\ndimensional geometry is the existence of locally much deeper hollows or swales or\ndepressions in ripple troughs, where the separated flow happens to become con-\ncentrated (because of the details of the ripple geometry upstream) and where scour\nor erosion is much stronger. As one of these swales moves downstream, driven by\nthe advancing ripple upstream, it carves a rounded furrow or trench, oriented\nparallel to the flow, which is then filled with scoop-shaped or spoon-shaped\nlaminae which are the foreset deposits of the upstream ripple. Eventually the\nresulting set of laminae is partly or mostly or even entirely eroded by the passage\nof a locally deeper swale in some later ripple trough. This accounts for both the\ngeometry of the sets and their irregular interleaving.\n4.3.2.6 On the rare occasions when you're able to see a planar section\nthrough the deposit parallel to the overall stratification, you see a geometry which\nlooks like Figure 3-17, which shows the truncated edges of sets of laminae that are\nstrongly concave downstream, separated laterally by truncation surfaces. This has\nbeen called rib and furrow (not a very descriptive term). It's an excellent pale-\nocurrent indicator.\nPlanar section through climbing-ripple cross-stratification.\n\n4.3.2.7 For large angles of climb, the general geometry of the cross-strati-\nfied deposit is shown by the block diagram in Figure 3-18. In addition to the\nactual rippled surface, Figure 3-18 shows a flow-parallel section and a flow-\ntransverse section perpendicular to the overall bedding. Compare Figure 3-18\nwith Figure 3-16.\n\nC\nl\ni\nm\nb\ni\nn\ng\n-ripple cross-stratification at large angles of climb.\n\n4.3.2.8 In sections parallel to flow, you see mostly continuous laminae whose\nshapes reflect the profiles of the ripples which were moving downstream while\nsediment was added to the bed. The local angles of climb vary from place to place\nin the deposit, because the speeds of the ripples are highly variable in time. So\nunless the overall angle of climb is very high, there are likely to be a few\ndiscontinuous truncation surfaces, where a particular ripple moved temporarily at\na speed much greater than average.\n4.3.2.9 In sections transverse to flow, you usually see just irregularly sinuous\nlaminae which reflect the changing flow-transverse profiles of the ripples as they\npassed a given cross-section of the flow.\n4.3.2.10 Remember that for intermediate angles of climb, the stratification\ngeometry is intermediate between the two end members presented above. As the\nangle of climb increases, the density and extent of truncation surfaces bounding\nthe sets decreases, and the average set thickness increases.\n4.3.2.11 For a given sand size, current ripples in equilibrium with the flow\ndon't vary greatly in either size or geometry with flow velocity, so unfortunately\nthere's little possibility of using the details of stratification geometry to say\nanything precise about the flow strength.\n\n4 .3.3 Large-Scale Cross stratification in Unidirectional Flow\n4.3.3.1 Large-scale cross stratification formed under unidirectional flow is\nmostly associated with the downstream movement of dunes. Again the general\nfeatures of the cross-stratification geometry depend on the geometry of the dunes\nand the angle of climb.\n4.3.3.2 Remember that dunes formed at relatively low flow velocities have a\ntendency to be two-dimensional: their crests and troughs are nearly continuous\n\nand fairly straight, and the elevations of the crests and troughs are nearly uniform\nin the direction transverse to flow. On the other hand, at relatively high flow\nvelocities the dunes are moderately to strongly three-dimensional, in much the\nsame way that ripples are three-dimensional. You should expect the geometry of\ncross stratification to vary greatly depending on whether the dunes were two-di-\nmensional or three-dimensional.\n4.3.3.3 Three-dimensional dunes produce cross stratification that's quali-\ntatively similar in geometry to the small-scale cross stratification produced by\nripples. You might reread the earlier section and apply it to the stratification\nproduced by three-dimensional dunes.\n4.3.3.4 Figure 3-19 is a block diagram of cross stratification produced by\nthree-dimensional dunes in unidirectional flows. It shows the dune-covered bed\nsurface and sections perpendicular to the overall plane of stratification and parallel\nand transverse to the flow direction. Most of what I said about the analogous\nsection in Figure 3-16 for cross stratification produced by ripples at low angles of\nclimb is applicable to Figure 3-19 as well. Set thickness ranges from less than 10\ncm to as much as a few meters.\n\nD\n\nd\nu\nn\ne\ns\ncross-stratification.\n\n4.3.3.5 Figure 3-20 is a corresponding block diagram of cross stratification\nproduced by almost perfectly two-dimensional dunes in unidirectional flows. The\nstratification geometry is rather different from that in Figure 4-19: in flow-parallel\nsections the sets extend somewhat farther and the set boundaries are less sinuous,\nbut the biggest difference is in flow-transverse sections, where both the sets and\nthe truncational set boundaries are much more extensive and show much less\nupward concavity. This is because of the absence of locally strong scour swales in\nthe troughs of the dunes.\n\n4.3.3.6 There's a whole spectrum of intermediate cases for which the cross-\nstratification geometry is less regular than the extreme case shown in Figure 3-22\nbut not as irregular as in Figure 3-19.\n\nD dunes cross-stratification.\n\n4.3.3.7 In both Figure 3-19 and Figure 3-20, the angle of climb of the dunes\nis very small. Dunes sometimes climb at higher angles, but that's not nearly as\ncommon as for ripples, because it's uncommon for fairly coarse sediment to be\nsettling abundantly out of suspension over large areas to build up the bed rapidly.\nIn the very few cases I've seen, the geometry of cross stratification is very much\nlike that shown in Figure 3-18.\n\n4 .3.4 Cross stratification in Oscillatory Flow\n4.3.4.1 Remember that in truly symmetrical oscillatory flow at low to\nmoderate oscillation periods and low to moderate oscillation speeds, the bed\nconfiguration is symmetrical two-dimensional oscillation ripples. Under these\nconditions, the sediment transport is also strictly symmetrical in the two flow di-\nrections. You might expect the ripples to remain in one place indefinitely. Then if\nsediment is supplied from suspension to build up the bed, symmetrical oscillation-\nripple cross stratification with vertical climb would be produced (Figure 3-21).\nAlthough this kind of stratification is present in the sedimentary record, it's not\ncommon, presumably because even in purely oscillatory flow there's usually a\nminor degree of asymmetry of sediment transport which causes the ripples to\nmove slowly in one direction or the other.\n\nVertical climb cross-stratification.\n\n4.3.4.2 Figure 3-22 is an attempt to account for oscillatory-flow cross\nstratification types produced by the buildup of two-dimensional oscillation ripples\nas a function of (i) the slow net rate of ripple movement and (ii) the rate of\naggradation of the bed. Along the vertical axis, for zero ripple movement, is\nsymmetrical oscillation-ripple cross stratification, of the kind I mentioned above\nmight be expected deductively. The chevron-like interleaving of laminae at the\nripple crests, shown schematically, results from minor shifts in crest position back\nand forth during aggradation. This is shown by the first box from the top in\nFigure 3-22.\nOscillatory-flow cross-stratification.\n\n4.3.4.3 If the ripple speed is nonzero but slow relative to aggradation rate,\nthe angle of climb is steep and the entire ripple profile is preserved (see second\nbox from the top in Figure 3-22). If the ripple speed is large relative to the\naggradation rate, ripple troughs erode into previously deposited laminae, and the\nstratification shows laminae dipping in one direction only, in sets bounded by ero-\nsion surfaces (see the third box from the top in Figure 3-22). This last type is the\nmost common in the sedimentary record. Note that this stratification differs only\nin detail, and not in general features, from low-angle climbing-ripple cross\nstratification produced by ripples in unidirectional flows, discussed in the previous\nsection. Finally, if a preexisting bed is molded into slowly shifting oscillation rip-\nples without any net aggradation of the bed, the thickness of the cross-stratified\ndeposit is equal to only one ripple height (see the bottom box in Figure 3-22).\n4.3.4.4 In the real world, oscillation-ripple stratification is likely to be more\ncomplicated, because wave conditions seldom remain the same for long.\nCommonly there are a large number of sets of laminae dipping more or less ran-\ndomly in both directions.\n4.3.4.5 The origin and classification of stratification produced by oscillatory\nflows at longer oscillation periods and higher oscillation velocities is much less\n\nwell understood, because there have been no studies in natural environments in\nwhich first the bed configuration was observed while the flow conditions were\nmeasured and then the bed was sampled to see the resulting deposit. And until\nonly recently there had been no studies under laboratory conditions. Another el-\nement of complexity is that in the natural environment the oscillatory flows are\nlikely to be more complicated than the regular and symmetrical bidirectional os-\ncillatory flows that were assumed above, and essentially nothing is known in detail\nabout the stratification types produced by these more complicated oscillatory\nflows.\n4.3.4.6 In the face of this seemingly hopeless situation, I'll take the following\napproach. I'll describe in a general way a common style of medium-scale to large-\nscale cross stratification, called hummocky cross stratification, which is generally\nbelieved to be produced by some kind of oscillatory flow, and I'll present what\nevidence I can for the kinds of flows that might produce hummocky cross\nstratification.\n4.3.4.7 Figure 3-23 is a block diagram of one of the common styles of cross\nstratification that's been called hummocky cross stratification. It shows sets of\nlaminae that are both concave upward and convex upward, bounded by broad\ntruncation surfaces which themselves may be either concave or convex upward.\nTwo characteristic small-scale features of the geometry of stratification are (i) the\nfanning of truncation surfaces laterally into conformable sequences of laminae\n(Figure 3-24) and, where the thickness of the bed is great enough to observe this,\n(ii) a tendency for convex-up sets of laminae to be succeeded upward by concave-\nup sets, and vice-versa (Figure 3-25).\n\nH\nu\nm\nm\no\nc\nk\ny\n\nc\nr\no\ns\ns-stratification.\n\nSmall-scale features of hummocky cross-stratification.\n\n4.3.4.8 Note that the two normal-to-bedding faces of the block are shown to\nhave about the same style of stratification, and on each face there's no strongly\npreferred dip direction. In the rare cases where you can make serial sections of the\ndeposit to ascertain the entire three-dimensional geometry of the deposit, it's clear\nthat there's no preferred dip direction in the entire deposit. This is the kind of\nstratification I call isotropic.\n4.3.4.9 The upper surface of the block diagram in Figure 3-23 is shown to be\na bedding surface with a bed configuration that could be described as a collection\nof hummocks (locally positive convex-up areas) and swales (locally negative con-\ncave-up areas). Sometimes, but not often, the upper surface of a bed with hum-\nmocky cross stratification can be seen to have just this bed geometry. The general\nbelief is that isotropic hummocky cross stratification is produced by this kind of\nbed configuration, although it's seldom possible to actually demonstrate this.\n4.3.4.10 Very recent preliminary experiments have shown that bed configu-\nrations which in their general features are like those just described are produced\nby symmetrical bidirectional oscillatory flows at long periods and high oscillation\nvelocities. This suggests that at least some isotropic hummocky cross stratification\nis produced by such flows. But it also seems likely that more complex oscillations\nwith more than one oscillatory component would also produce qualitatively\nsimilar bed configurations and therefore similar cross stratification. Much more\nwork needs to be done before the origin of hummocky cross stratification is well\nunderstood.\n4.3.4.11 This brings us to the problem of combined-flow cross stratification.\nUnfortunately there's an almost complete lack of observational information on the\norigin of combined-flow cross stratification, so we have no actual models to guide\ninterpretations. Up to now the recognition of combined-flow cross stratification\nhas been a strictly deductive matter.\n\n4.3.4.12 It seems convenient to think separately about the relatively small\ncombined-flow ripples produced under combinations of relatively low oscillatory\nand unidirectional flow velocities, on the one hand, and the relatively large com-\nbined-flow ripples produced under combinations of relatively high oscillatory and\nunidirectional flow velocities, on the other hand.\n4.3.4.13 When the combinations of oscillation period and oscillation ve-\nlocity are such that in purely oscillatory flow the ripples would be at about the\nsame scale as current ripples, there's a kind of coherence in the combined-flow\nripples: they're on the same scale as unidirectional-flow ripples, but more nearly\ntwo-dimensional. Actual experiments indicate that only a very small unidirec-\ntional component is needed to make such ripples noticeably asymmetrical.\n4.3.4.14 But for very short periods or very long periods, when the ripples\nthat would be produced in purely oscillatory flow are much smaller or much larger\nthan current ripples, the situation is more complicated, because in combined flows\nthe bed configuration wants to be at two separate scales, and there's a complicated\ninteraction between the two differing scales. There have been no detailed studies\nof the stratification produced under these combined-flow conditions.\n4.3.4.15 The large oscillation ripples in fine sediments which are known to\nbe produced at long periods and high velocities become asymmetrical in the pres-\nence of even fairly weak unidirectional components, and the stratification they\nproduce during bed aggradation is probably what many workers recognize as\nanisotropic hummocky cross stratification. But detailed interpretations are a\nmatter for the future.\n4.3.4.16 Also still unstudied is the geometry of cross stratification produced\nwhen unidirectional-flow dunes are subjected to a nonnegligible oscillatory com-\nponent. This situation must be important in natural environments, but systematic\nstudies have yet to be made in either the field or the laboratory.\n\n4.3.5 Eolian Cross stratification\n\n4.3.5.1 So far our account of cross stratification has implicitly been directed\ntoward subaqueous bed configurations. Everyone knows that the shifting of eolian\ndunes produces large-scale cross stratification too. To first order, eolian dune\ncross stratification is similar in gross aspects to subaqueous dune cross\nstratification. But behind the gross similarity are real differences. These\ndifferences are simply a consequence of the differing details of geometry of the\ndunes themselves, and of the sediment transport over them.\n\nθ Eolian cross stratification tends to have a \"swoopy\" look (pardon the\nlooseness of terminology here) that's difficult to pin down in detail. We think that\nthat look reflects the tendency for the troughs of eolian dunes to be filled by\nplastering of new trough laminae not just on the mean-upcurrent side, as is usually\nthe case in subaqueous cross stratification, but on the lateral and mean-\ndowncurrent sides as well.\nθ Eolian cross stratification is more likely to show greater dispersion of dip\ndirections of cross-sets, because of the greater variability of wind directions than\nof subaqueous current directions. (But this is not as strong a tendency as you\nmight think, because most of the major eolian sand bodies preserved in the\n\nsedimentary record were probably produced in sand seas swept by winds fairly\nconstant in direction.)\nθ The nature of the lamination in eolian cross-sets tends to be different from\nthat in subaqueous cross-sets. The three basic kinds of laminae in cross-sets are:\n-- grain-flow laminae, produced by the downslope movement of grain\nflows to iron out the oversteepening of the foreset slope caused by deposition at\nthe brink\n-- grain-fall laminae, produced by the rain of sand grains onto the foreset\nslope after they are carried across the brink in saltation\n-- translatent laminae, produced by the movement and very-low-angle\nclimb of ripples on sand surfaces that are undergoing net aggradation\nThe first two kinds of laminae are common to both subaerial and subaqueous\ncross-sets, but they are much more distinctive and better differentiated in sub-\naerial deposits. Translatent laminae are specific to subaerial deposits, because in\nsubaqueous environments the scale and movement of ripples in dune-lee envi-\nronments is such as to produce recognizable small-scale cross-lamination rather\nthan laminae so thin that the cross-stratified nature is undetectible, as in the eolian\ncase.\n\n4.3.6 Cross stratification Not Produced by Climbing Bed Forms\n\n4.3.6.1 After all of the foregoing voluminous material on how to deal with\ncross stratification produced by trains of repetitive bed forms that climb at some\nangle owing to net aggradation of the bed, it's important to point out here that not\nall cross stratification is produced by bed forms climbing at some angle--\nalthough we think it's fair to say that most of the cross stratification you see is\nindeed formed in that way.\n4.3.6.2 One case in point is pretty obvious, and has been touched upon in the\nearlier part of this chapter:\n\na train of flow-transverse bed forms is produced by a\nneutral flow (by \"neutral\" we mean that there's neither\nnet aggradation or net degradation) over a loose sed-\niment bed, then the flow quits, and later the train of\nbed forms is mantled or draped by sediment deposited\nin such a way as not to disturb that underlying train of\nbed forms (by fallout without traction, for the most\npart).\n\nThis kind of cross stratification might be termed, unofficially, single-bed-form-\ntrain cross stratification. It's common in both oscillatory flow and unidirectional\nflow. Depending on the thickness of movable sediment the flow has to operate on,\nand the size of the bed forms the flow wants to make, the train of bed forms may\nbe starved (Figure 3-25A), full (Figure 3-25B), or starting to climb up one another\n(Figure 3-25C).\n\nS\ni\nngle-ripple-train cross-stratification.\n\n4.3.6.3 Usually the material presented so far in this section on cross\nstratification is relevant to small-scale bed configurations--ripples of various\nkinds--but sometimes single trains of much larger dunes are formed and then\ninterred within different, or at least differently structured, sediment. When the\ndunes have large spacings and small height-to-spacing ratios, there's the added\ncomplication that you may on the outcrop see a segment of a dune that's very short\nrelative to the dune spacing, and the cross stratification looks like a planar-tabular\nset with uniform thickness (Figure 3-26). We know of no way of knowing, just\nfrom looking at an outcrop like Figure 3-26, what the original spacing of the dunes\nwas--or even if I'm really dealing with a train of dunes in the first place!\n\nA\n\np\nl\na\nn\na\nr\n-\nt\na\nb\nu\nl\nar cross-set.\n\n4.3.6.4 In a situation like that shown in Figure 3-26, there's also the problem\nof whether the full height of the dune is preserved. You might find features at the\nupper surface of the cross-set that gives evidence of its having been the exposed\nupper surface of a dune, like superimposed smaller bed forms. Although that's not\nfoolproof, it would suggest strongly that the dune was not eroded or shaved off by\na later strong current after its own driving current ceased.\n4.3.6.5 Finally, cross stratification can be formed by the progradation of the\nsloping surface of an isolated element of positive relief, like a sand bar or shoal or\ndelta body. Scales of such features can range up to very large. Deciding between\nthis situation and the one described above (a small part of a single train of dunes)\nwould be impossible without a degree of lateral control not usually available in\noutcrop.\n\n5. PLANAR STRATIFICATION\n5.1 There is not as much to say about planar stratification as there is about\ncross stratification--because its geometry in inherently simpler! That's not to say\nthat it is not important: there is at least as much planar stratification in particulate\nsediments and sedimentary rocks (conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, shales,\nand limestones) as there is cross stratification, and even more in gravels and\nconglomerates, in particular. Planar stratification is also common in carbonate\nrocks, although less so than in siliciclastics. It is unfortunately true, however, that\nthe possibilities for interpretation of depositional conditions are less abundant for\nplanar stratification than for cross stratification.\n5.2 We need to make a distinction here between planar stratification in\nwhich an entire bed, which might be as much as some meters thick, has an overall\nplanar geometry, in the sense that the lower and upper surfaces of the bed are\nplanar (the geometry of such a bed could also be described as tabular), on the one\nhand (this might best be called planar bedding), and planar stratification within\nsuch an overall planar-tabular bed, on the other hand (Figure 3-27). The latter\nkind of planar stratification usually comprises strata that are sufficiently thin as to\nbe called laminae, in which case we talk of planar lamination, or a planar-\nlaminated bed. (Keep in mind the terminological distinction between beds and\nlaminae.) A planar bed.\n\nFigure 3-27: A planar bed, with planar internal lamination\n}\nplanar\nlamination\nbed base\na planar bed\nbed Top\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n5.3 What is the origin of planar lamination?\n- In many cases, especially in fine siliciclastic sediments and sedimentary\nrocks, it must certainly be the outcome of deposition by fallout without traction in\nwhich the nature of the settling material varies, for some reason, with time. The\ndifferences might be in particle size or in composition. Such lamination is\ncommonly way down in the submillimeter thickness range. Many mudrocks and\nshales show such planar lamination.\n- Planar stratification is also common in successions of interbedded thin (on\na centimeter or even a millimeter scale) event siltstones or very fine sandstones\nand \"background\" (that is, fallout-without-traction) mudrocks or shales. You will\nlearn more about such event beds later. In brief, an event stratum (usually referred\nto as an event bed) is any stratum that was deposited by a brief event, on a\ngeologically instantaneous time scale, by such things as turbidity currents, debris\nflows, river floods, or shallow-marine storms.\n- In many well-sorted coarse siltstones and sandstones, the planar lamination\nis the outcome of fallout with traction or of differential transport (See the\ndiscussion of modes of deposition at the end of the preceding chapter.) How\nmight we know that? Because of its commonly close association with ripple and\ndune stratification In what seems to be a flow environment in which the flow\nstrength is decreasing with time (from plane-bed transport to ripples or dunes).\n5.4 In interpreting planar lamination, there is a kind of \"awkward range\" in\nparticle size in which the size is not fine enough for a confident interpretation of\nfallout without traction but not coarse enough for a clear interpretation of a\nstrong flow. To put that another way, with increasing particle size it becomes less\nand less likely that the flow could be carrying enough sediment in suspension to\nform a planar-laminated deposit just by fallout without traction--because the\nsettling velocity increases rapidly with particle size, thereby cutting down the\npossible distance over which suspension fallout can occur.\n5.5 In planar lamination in sands and sandstones, the differences in particle\ncharacteristics from lamina to lamina are usually subtle, even to the point at which\nit takes special observational techniques (like x-radiography of thin slabs cut\nnormal to stratification) even to detect its presence. In some cases, slightly\nvarying concentrations of dark particles (heavy minerals; scraps of organic matter)\nhighlight the lamination; usually, however, there are only slight differences in\nmean size and/or sorting. Such differences are often detectable on a fresh\nsediment surface but become accentuated by weathering of a rock surface or by\netching of an unconsolidated sediment surface by drying by the wind.\n5.6 For a long time the origin of the slight differences in texture in planar-\nlaminated sandstones was poorly understood. Laboratory experiments in recent\nyears, however, have revealed that much if not most such planar lamination is\ngenerated by the downstream movement of very low-amplitude bed waves (akin to\nvery low, shingle-like dunes) on an almost planar transport surface.\n\n6. SOLE MARKS\n\n6.1 Sole marks are another important kind of sedimentary structure, less\ncommon than cross stratification. Sole marks are geometrical features produced\non a sediment bed by erosion by a strong current (flute marks), or by mechanical\ndisruption of the bed by large objects carried by a strong current (tool marks).\n6.2 The line between bed configurations and sole marks is not entirely sharp,\nbut with sole marks we're dealing with a short-lived current acting upon a semico-\nhesive bed, usually of mud. This is usually a sediment gravity flow in a moder-\nately deep marine environment (if you mention sole marks to most soft-rock geol-\nogists they'll think of turbidites), but strong currents in other situations can make\nsole marks as well.\n6.3 Strong currents are known to produce erosional flutes with characteris-\ntic geometries on semicohesive mud beds. The flutes range in scale from just a\nfew centimeters across to giants a few meters across. They are narrow, steep-\nsided, and often curled at the upcurrent end, and wider and shallower downstream.\nThey thus make excellent paleocurrent indicators. Their origin was first deduced\nfrom the ancient record, but they have since been reproduced beautifully in the\nlaboratory.\n6.4 Important: you almost always see sole marks in negative relief, because\nusually the strong current that makes the marks later deposits a bed of sand (or\neven gravel). After burial, lithification, uplift, and erosion, what remains for you\nto see, usually in outcrops with steep dips, is the underside of the sandstone bed,\nthe shale having been weathered away. For this reason you often see the term flute\ncast (although curiously, one never sees the term \"tool cast\"!).\n6.5 I won't illustrate sole marks here, because I'll have slides for you later.\nSee also Potter and Pettijohn, Atlas and Glossary of Primary Sedimentary Struc-\ntures.\n\n7. SOFT-SEDIMENT DEFORMATION\n\n7.1 Introduction\n\n7.1.1 The only other kind of sedimentary structure I'll talk about here is soft-\nsediment deformation, also called (less felicitously) penecontemporaneous\ndeformation: deformation, usually of the continuous sort involving folding and\ncontortions, that developed long before the sediment was lithified. One often sees\nmildly to grossly deformed strata, on scales of centimeters to a few meters, that by\nvarious kinds of evidence must have happened only shortly after burial, when the\nsediment was still effectively noncohesive and buried less than a few meters.\nSome deformation can be shown to have happened even earlier--during, not after,\ndeposition.\n7.1.2 There are several common styles of soft-sediment deformation, and a\nthorough analysis of the mechanics involved would take a lot of time and space.\nAll I'll do here is point out what must be the principal underlying reasons for the\noccurrence of soft-sediment deformation, and some brief description and illustra-\ntion of the most common kinds.\n\n7.1.3 Sediments ranging from coarse silt size up into the gravel range can be\nviewed as a packed framework of grains in mutual contact. Usually, however,\ngrain-by-grain depositional mechanisms are such that the resulting deposit is not\npacked as closely as possible: the porosity is greater, and the number of grains\ncontacts smaller, than the ultimate values attainable by rearrangement of the\ngrains. So any kind of disturbance to the sediment bed, like an earthquake, can\ncause a sudden repacking of the grains: the grains fall into a new, closer packing\nin a kind of wave that sweeps through a more or less large volume of the sediment.\nAs this happens, the repacking sediment finds itself suffused with excess pore\nwater, which can do nothing but drain more or less slowly outward by flowing\nthrough the surrounding porous sediment. While there is excess pore water, the\nsediment is in a liquefied state, in that it is not locked into packing by being in\ncontact with surrounding grains. This process is called liquefaction. Especially in\nfiner sediments, like silts and very fine sands, the permeability is so small, owing\nto the smallness of the pore passageways, that the sediment remains in a liquefied\nstate for some time--long enough to deform under the influence of whatever small\nanisotropic stress field happens to be present within the sediment.\n\n7.2 Styles of Soft-Sediment Deformation\n\nLoading. Sometimes the stratification in a sedimentary sequence is gravita-\ntionally unstable, in that a given bed has a greater bulk density than the bed un-\nderlying it. Then, if the sediment becomes mobilized as discussed above, there is\na tendency for the material of the overlying bed to sink down into the underlying\nbed and (usually more diffusely) for the material of the underlying bed to rise up\ninto the overlying material. This phenomenon is called loading (Figure 3-28).\nIn mild cases, there is just some local and partial downward motion of the\noverlying bed into the underlying bed, especially in places where the contact\nbetween the two beds is convex downward owing to deposition. Loading of this\nkind is usually seen where a water-rich sand bed was deposited over a semicohe-\nsive mud bed. Sole markings, for example, are often accentuated, sometimes\ngrossly so, by later loading. Loading.\nBall-and-pillow structure. In more extreme examples of loading, whole\nmasses of the overlying bed sink down into the underlying material. Usually these\nFigure 3-28: Loading\nLoadin\ng.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nmasses end up with concave-up stratification that is terminated abruptly around\nthe margins of the sunken mass. This called ball-and-pillow structure (Figure\n3-29).\n\nSlump folding. Another kind of soft-sediment deformation is slump folding\n(Figure 3-30). When sediment on a slope is liquefied, it tends to flow or slide\ndown the slope, even if the slope angle is only a few degrees. Various patterns of\nfolding develop, with downslope vergence of the folds. The folds are\ncharacteristically tight, often even isoclinal and recumbent. Scales range up to\nsome meters. Sometimes these folds are truncated by erosion and overlain by very\nsimilar sedimentary material, emphasizing the slight depth of burial of material\nwhen it is deformed. Such erosion is presumptive evidence of penecon-\ntemporaneity (but you have to make sure that what you're thinking is an erosion\nsurface isn't instead a gently dipping local fault associated with the deformation!).\n\nFigure 3-29: Ball-and-pillow structure\nFigure 3-30: Slump folding\nB\na\nll-and-pillow structure.Slump folding.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nConvolute lamination. Finally, another style of soft-sediment folding,\ncalled convolute lamination, is characteristic of beds of fine sand, up to a meter\nthick, deposited rapidly by such events as turbidity currents (Figure 3-31). The\nbeds have planar lower and also upper contacts, but the bed is internally folded\ninto broad synclines and sharp to dome-shaped or even mushroom-shaped anti-\nclines, which usually die out upward to planarity at the upper contact. Sometimes\nit can even be demonstrated that the folding developed concurrently with the de-\nvelopment and downcurrent movement of ripples on the rapidly aggrading\ntransport surface.\n\n8. OTHER SEDIMENTARY STRUCTURES\n\nAside from stratification, sole marks, and soft-sediment deformation, there\nare many other kinds of sedimentary structures. In this final \"wastebasket\"\nsection, I'll mention a few other primary sedimentary structures. Beyond that,\nthere are biogenic sedimentary structures (trace fossils), which I will describe in\nmore detail in a later chapter.\n\n- desiccation cracks: Also called, less precisely mud cracks, these are\ntension cracks or fractures that extend downward from a bed top into the sediment\nbelow. They are arranged in a network, which in some cases comprises nearly\nregular hexagons or rectangles but more commonly are of irregular geometry.\nTheir characteristic spacing ranges from a few centimeters to many decimeters in\nextreme cases. They commonly taper downward to a sharp lower end, at depths of\ncentimeters to as much as a few decimeters in extreme cases. It is clear that the\nform during shrinkage consequent upon drying of the a surficial layer of\nunconsolidated sediment. The sediment can shrink vertically with no cracking,\nbut lateral shrinkage causes tensile stresses that result in the cracking.\nThe significance of desiccation cracks is the evidence they give of subaerial\nexposure of the sediment surface--that is, emergence of a previously submerged\ndepositional surface. They can also be a top-and-bottom indicator, inasmuch as\nthey commonly taper downward, are capped above by a later-deposited bed, and\nare filled with that same later-deposited sediment (Figure 3-31). In some cases,\nwhen a thin bed is undergoes desiccation cracking, the individual segments of the\ncracked bed curl upward, and the later-deposited sediment insinuates itself beneath\nthe up-curled edges (Figure 3-32).\n\nFigure 3-31: Convolute lamination Convolute lamination.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nD\ne\ns\ni\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n\nc\nr\nacks\n.\n\n- Raindrop impressions: When a soft, moist surface of freshly deposited\nsediment is exposed to a brief, light shower of large raindrops, tiny craters,\ncircular in outline and with a slightly raised rim, are imprinted upon the sediment\nsurface. If they survive long enough to be buried by later deposition, they can be\npreserved intact in the sedimentary record Figure 3-33: Shrock, R.R., 1948,\nSequence in Layered Rocks: McGraw-Hill, 507 p. (p. 142, Figure 141). As with\ndesiccation cracks (although they are much less common), they give excellent\nevidence of subaerial emergence and also of tops and bottoms.\n\n- Graded bedding: If the particle size in a siliciclastic bed varies\nsystematically upward through the bed, the bed is said to be graded. (In a sense,\ngraded bedding lies somewhere between being a texture and a structure, but\nbecause I did not mention it in Chapter 1, I'm mentioning it here.) If the particle\nsize decreases upward, the bed is said to be normally graded; if the particle size\nincreases upward, the bed is said to be reversely graded or inversely graded (both\nterms are in use).\nThe term \"normal\" probably arose because of the belief, commonly but not\nalways justified, that in the normal course of a depositional event the strength of\nthe depositing flow, and thereby the particle size of the sediment being deposited,\ndecreases. Accounting for reverse grading is not as simple: one might appeal to a\nstrengthening flow, or, alternatively, to collapse and immobilization of a highly\nconcentrated flow in which, for dynamical reasons that remain unclear, the particle\nsize in the moving sediment-water mixture increases upward.\nSome workers have appealed to a simple kinematic effect that might account\nfor reverse grading: the kinetic sieve effect, whereby finer particles can find their\nway relatively easily downward among coarser particles but coarser particles\ncannot find their way easily down among finer particles.\nA distinction can be made between two kinds of grading: distribution\ngrading, whereby the entire frequency distribution of the sediment shifts toward a\nfiner or a coarser mean size, and coarse-tail grading, whereby the frequency\ndistribution of the main mass of the sediment stays about the same but the\npercentage of sediment in the coarse tail of the distribution changes significantly.\n\nFigure 3-32: Desiccation cracks\nFigure by MIT OCW."

      "content": "Chapter 4\n\nSILICICLASTIC ROCKS\n\n1. SANDSTONES\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\n1.1.1 Sandstones are an important group of sedimentary rocks. I suppose a\ngood estimate of the percentage of sedimentary rocks that would be classified as\nsandstones is about 25%.\n1.1.2 Defining what's meant by the term sandstone turns out not to be easy.\nRecall from Chapter 1 that all sedimentary particles between 1/16 mm and 2 mm\nshould be called sand, regardless of composition. But terminology for a sand\ndeposit, as distinct from sand grain size, is more difficult. For a deposit to be\ncalled a sand, \"most\" of the particles must be in the sand size range. But how\nmuch is \"most\"? How much finer and/or coarser material can there be in a sand\ndeposit? Various attempts have been made to erect terminology for mixtures of\nsand and finer/coarser sediment, with quantitative boundaries. There's no standard\nclassification, but nobody seems to worry much about that. Figure 4-1 shows two\nways of dealing with mixtures of sand and mud, one \"rational\", seemingly\ncomposed with logicality and symmetry in mind, and the other reflecting marine-\ngeological practice. And 4-2 shows two ways of dealing with mixtures of sand\nand gravel, the first idealized and symmetrical, and the other reflecting field usage.\nThe same difficulties in distinguishing between a sandstone and a conglomerate, at\nthe one end, and between a sandstone and a siltstone, on the other end, are similar.\nIf the rock has a lot of silt in it as well as sand, you can call it a silty sandstone,\nand if it has a lot of gravel in it was well as sand, you can call it a gravelly (or\npebbly) sandstone or a conglomeratic sandstone. But note this: the rock doesn't\nhave to have much gravel in it, perhaps 10-20%, or even less in the view of some\npeople, before it starts to get called a conglomerate, because of the prominence\nand (presumably) significance of that small percentage of gravel. But, with all\nthat said, this whole matter isn't something you have to worry much about when\nyou're in the field actually working with sandstones.\n\nC\nl\na\ns\ns\ni\nf\ni\ncatio\nns o\nf mi\nxture\ns of\nsand\n, si\nlt an\nd cl\nay.\n\nFigure 4-1: Two classifications of mixtures of sand, silt, and clay\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nC\nl\na\ns\ns\ni\nf\ni\nc\nati\non\ns\nof\n\nmix\ntu\nre\ns\no\nf s\nan\nd\nan\nd\ngr\nav\nel.\nL\n\nFigure 4-2: Two classifications of mixtures of sand and gravel\n\n1.1.3 Sands (sand deposits) can be of any composition: siliciclastic, car-\nbonate, or even evaporitic, in the case of wind-blown or water-transported gypsum\nparticles on playa surfaces in deserts. But once the deposit is lithified enough to\nbe called a sandstone (and you should realize that the boundary between sand and\nsandstone is broadly transitional and not conventionally established in any way),\nthe term sandstone is applied only to siliciclastic rocks, not to carbonates; in the\ncase of clastic carbonate rocks whose particles are of sand size, the term limestone\ntakes precedence over the term sandstone.\n1.1.4 Miscellaneous comments about sandstones:\n\nθ Sandstones show an extremely wide range of framework composition,\nfrom all quartz to not much quartz and lots of feldspar and/or rock fragments.\nθ Sandstones also show an extremely wide range of textures, from very well\nsorted and well rounded to very poorly sorted and subangular.\nθ Sorting and rounding of the framework grains tend to vary together, but\nthere are important exceptions.\nθ Framework composition and framework texture are strongly correlated:\nsandstones with varied framework composition tend to have poorly sorted and\npoorly rounded framework grains, and sandstones with all-quartz framework\ncomposition tend to have well sorted and well rounded framework grains--but\nagain there are important exceptions.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nθ Sedimentary structures in sandstones, both primary and secondary, are\ncommon, prominent, and extremely useful in interpreting depositional environ-\nments--more so than in other rocks.\n\n1.2 How Do You Know It's a Sandstone?\n\n1.2.1 Seems like a silly question, I suppose. Usually the situation is clear,\nbut the question is sometimes not a trivial one when you're on the outcrop. And\nit's especially acute when someone hands you a little out-of-context hand speci-\nmen and you have to perform. I don't want to be too cookbookish, but here are\nsome considerations:\n\nθ Look for detrital grains of sand size. Even in the finest sandstones,\nmineral oil and a hand lens usually do a good job. If the sandstone is fairly fine\nand very matrix-rich, this may be difficult or impossible, especially if the rock is\non its way toward metamorphism.\nθ Be cautious about calling it a limestone just because it fizzes in acid. That\nmay well be carbonate cement or a small percentage of carbonate grains or fossils\nin a true sandstone.\nθ In really difficult situations, overall bedding may suggest a sandstone\nrather than some other kind of rock--but you may still be dealing with a volcanic\nigneous rock.\n\n1.2.2 Here's an annotated list of other rock types with which you might\nconfuse sandstone on occasion:\n\nθ volcanics: in the case of felsic volcanics, there's a true gradation in the\nfirst place (see later section on volcaniclastic rocks), and many felsic volcanics\nlook superficially like certain \"ordinary\" sandstones. In the case of mafic vol-\ncanics, some dark graywackes look a lot like basalts/andesites.\nθ limestones: aside from the fact that there are truly intermediate cases, in\nwhich some of the framework is carbonate and some is siliciclastic, certain dark\nunfossiliferous limestones look superficially like sandstones. But if you use the\nright techniques you shouldn't have much trouble with this.\nθ granites: in some cases, coarse well cemented feldspar-rich sandstones\ncan look a lot like granites (from which they probably were derived in the first\nplace). Careful examination of texture, and a chance to see bedding, usually takes\ncare of this confusion.\nθ low-grade metamorphics: here the problem is one of judgment about\nwhere to draw the line. If you want to claim it as a sandstone, go ahead.\n\n1.2.3 Here's a list of the properties of a sandstone you could measure or\ndescribe.\n\n\"fundamental\":\n\n\"component\" composition (minerals, rock fragments, fossils, organic mat-\nter)\ntexture (grain size grain shape, grain arrangement)\nsedimentary structures\n\n\"derived\":\n\nchemical composition\nbulk density\ncolor\nstrength (tensile, compressive, shear)\nporosity\npermeability\nelastic wave velocity\nelectrical properties\nheat capacity\nthermal conductivity\netc.\n\n1.2.4 In addition to these, there are a number of other important things you\ncan describe that don't fit neatly into the above list:\n\nfriability (degree of induration or lithification)\nparting characteristics\ndevelopment of rock cleavage\nweathering characteristics\nledge/cliff-forming tendency\n1.3 Constituents of Sandstones (Partly Review)\n\nframework grains:\nquartz (usually dominant)\nfeldspar (Kspar >> plag; usually partly altered; microcline > orthoclase)\nrock fragments (chert/quartzite act like quartz; others nonresistant)\nheavy minerals (varied; most of minerals; seldom abundant)\nmicas (common, never high %; muscovite >> biotite)\nclastic carbonates (mixtures less common than ends)\nglauconite (local, sometimes abundant in quartz-rich ss)\n\nvoid filler:\nquartz (as secondary overgrowths)\nquartz (as recrystallized amorphous silica)\nchert (amorphous silica)\ncalcite (dolomite less common)\nhematite (primary? secondary?)\nexotica (anhydrite, gypsum, barite, halite, siderite, etc.)\nmatrix (fine material, not authigenic):\nfine detrital nonphyllosilicates (quartz, feldspar, carbonates)\nfine detrital phyllosilicates (starts as clay-mineral mud, gets recrystallized to\n\"sericite\", \"white mica\", chlorite)\nreorganized phyllosilicate-rich coarse rock fragments\n\n1.4 Classification\n\n1.4.1 A lot of effort has gone into devising rational classifications of sand-\nstones--more than for other sedimentary rocks. Everyone agrees that classifica-\ntions are important and useful, not only for communication but also for organi-\nzation of thought; a good classification can help reveal underlying regularities that\nneed to be explained.\n1.4.2 There are many different kinds of classification. Usually a distinction\nis made between a genetic classification and a descriptive classification. In\nclassifying rocks, there's general agreement that the best classification is one that's\ndescriptive but with a genetic basis; such a classification has the advantage of\nbeing objective but at the same time oriented toward the genesis of the rock. (The\ntrouble with classifying a sandstone as eolian, say, is that your interpretation of the\ndepositional environment is built in, and you may be wrong.)\n1.4.3 Here are some of the important genetically based defining parameters\nthat could be used:\n\nprovenance\nmineralogical maturity\ntextural maturity\ndepositional environment\ndiagenesis\n\nAlmost without exception, classifications have made use of the first three of these.\n1.4.4 A large number of classifications have been formally proposed, in\nprint. All but a handful of these have seen little use. Most are of no more than\nhistorical interest at this point. Probably the most widely used classification now\nis that of Pettijohn, Potter, and Siever. It's shown as Figure 4-3, in a three-di-\nmensional sketch.\n\nC\nl\na\ns\ns\ni\nf\ni\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn of sandstones.\n\nFigure 4-3: The Pettijohn/Potter/Siever classification, of sandstones\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n1.4.5 The main idea behind the classification is that there are two broad\ntextural kinds of sandstones--those, called arenites, without appreciable fine\nmatrix along with the framework grains, and those, called wackes, with appre-\nciable fine matrix along with the framework grains. Within each of these sand-\nstone classes, names are assigned on the basis of the percentages of three major\nframework constituents: quartz, feldspar, and rock fragments.\n1.4.6 I should emphasize that this the classification in Figure 4-3 can be used\nonly to a limited extent in the field. It's designed for thin-section work. It'll be\nuseful to you in the field only if the sandstone is fairly coarse. If you find you\ncan't apply it in the field, don't worry.\n1.4.7 Sandstone petrologists play lots of games beyond just this classifica-\ntion. They love to make triangular composition diagrams. To do this, you have to\nmake careful and tedious point counts in thin section. Figure 4-4 shows some\nexamples.\n\nT\ne\nr\nn\na\nr\ny\n\nc\no\nm\nposition diagrams.\n\nKey:\nQ\nquartz\nF\nfeldspar\nL\nrock (\"lithic\") fragments\nP\nplagioclase\nK\nKspar\nLv\nvolcanic rock fragments\nLm\nmetamorphic rock fragments\nLs\nsedimentary rock fragments\n\n1.5 Kinds of Sandstones\n\n1.5.1 Even aside from rational pigeonhole classifications like the one pre-\nsented above, most people would agree, at least in a general way, that there are\n\"kinds\" or fairly natural groupings of sandstones, albeit with very broad and\nblurred boundaries among them. Thinking about sandstones like this is often\nuseful in making broad interpretations of geological setting, but it can be mis-\nleading. So I want you to be cautious about what I'm going to say next.\n\nquartz arenites:\nAlmost all quartz plus a little chert and resistant heavies in the framework;\nsilica or carbonate cement; no matrix; very well sorted and rounded; lightest color\nof sandstones; planar lamination or large-scale cross-lamination; section thickness\nlow; thin, widespread, patchy blankets; associated with limestone and shale;\nusually marine, craton to miogeocline.\n\nfeldspathic sandstones:\nQuartz variable but feldspar abundant in the framework, mostly Kspar, rock\nfragments subordinate, coarse detrital mica common; silica and secondary feldspar\ncement common; some matrix but not a lot, mostly kaolinite; coarsest of\nsandstones; tends to be reddish; large-scale cross-stratification common; section\nthin to thick; blankets like quartz arenite, or thick wedges and prisms; associated\nwith either quartz arenite or red shale, conglomerate, volcanics; craton to mio-\ngeocline (marine), or fault-block basins (nonmarine).\n\nlithic sandstones:\nQuartz abundant, rock fragments second, feldspar variable but third; variable\namount and composition of matrix; silica or carbonate cement; color variable,\noften salt-and-peppery; fine-medium sand size common; cross-stratification\nprominent; section thickness middling; tabular, lenticular, shoestring shapes; as-\nsociated with shale, conglomerate, not much limestone; fluvial or shallow marine;\nmiogeoclinal and post-tectonic basins.\n\ngraywackes:\nQuartz variable, often less than 75%, feldspar and rock fragments variable;\nmatrix prominent; usually poor sorting and rounding; color gray, darkest of sand-\nstones; pelagic marine fossils; graded bedding, sole marks, small-scale cross-\nstratification; section thickness large; thick lenticular shapes; associated with\nshale, bedded chert, submarine volcanics; deeper marine trough fillings in mobile\nbelts (eugeoclinal).\n\n2. CONGLOMERATES\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\n2.1.1 Conglomerates are far less abundant in the sedimentary record than\nsandstones. But they're important far beyond their abundance. Why? For three\nreasons:\n\nθ Because of what they tell us about depositional environment: if you can\nbe sure that the gravel was actually transported (rather than being just the in-place\nresiduum of weathering) then the presence of gravel-size material indicates strong\ncurrents. That's one of the firmest interpretations you can make in sedimentary\npetrology.\nθ Because of what they tell us about provenance: to get gravel-size material\ncoming out of the source area, there must have been high relief, and therefore\nstrong uplift. So the presence of gravels in the sedimentary record is a good\nindication of tectonism in the source area. Here's another one of those important\nfirst-order interpretations that are generally accepted to be fairly reliable.\nθ Because conglomerates present a record of the rock types present in the\nsource area. It's sort of like having little source-area outcrops delivered to your\ndoor. There's still the problem of representativeness (some rock types are less\nlikely to produce gravel-size debris than others), but the problem is not nearly as\nsevere as for sandstones.\n\n2.1.2 With regard to the first point, the physical mechanisms involved in\ndeposition of gravels are not well understood, so detailed interpretations of de-\npositional mechanisms based on study of conglomerates is much less advanced\nthan for sandstones.\n\n2.2 Terminology\n\n2.2.1 A rock containing as little as 10-20% gravel-size clasts is usually\ncalled a conglomerate, although actually it should be called a conglomeratic\nsandstone or even a conglomeratic mudstone; see the chapter on sandstones.\n2.2.2 Technically, terminology differs depending on clast roundness (Figure\n4-5). A conglomerate with angular clasts is called a breccia (watch out; there are\nlots of other kinds of breccias besides sedimentary breccias), and the unconsoli-\ndated equivalent is called rubble. Breccia is also called sharpstone conglomerate,\nin contrast to roundstone conglomerate. But this is not a big deal, because\nsedimentary breccias are a lot less common than conglomerates. Also keep in\nmind that breccia is a more general term for fragmental rock consisting of angular\nfragments. There are many kinds of breccia, depending upon how the\nfragmentation developed:\n\nT\ne\nr\nm\ni\nn\no\nl\no\ng\ny\n\nf\nor gra\nvels and congl\nomerates.\n\nvolcanic breccia\ntectonic breccia\nintrusion breccia\nsedimentary breccia\nsolution-collapse breccia\nlandslide breccia\nmeteorite-impact breccia\n\nHow do you tell all of these apart? It's often very difficult.\n\n2.3 Descriptive Stuff\n\n2.3.1\nFigure 4-6 shows an unofficial list of size-distribution types in\nconglomerates you're likely to see. Remember that there are\nthree different grain-size components (gravel, sand, mud),\npresumably with different hydrodynamic significance. (Never\nmind that these are to a great extent arbitrary categories.) The\nthings you have to worry about are sorting, number of modes,\nand clast support vs. matrix support.\n\nFigure 4-5: Terminology for gravels and conglomerates\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nS\ni\nz\ne\n-\nd\ni\ns\nt\nr\ni\nb\nu\nt\ni\no\nn\n\nt\ny\np\ne\ns\n.\n\n2.3.2 I think the three most common textural categories are:\n\nbimodal clast-supported with sand matrix\nbimodal matrix-supported with sand matrix\nunimodal poorly sorted (with abundant mud )\n\n2.3.3 In terms of fabric, think about tendencies toward preferred orientation\nof crudely triaxial-ellipsoid gravel clasts. Here are the commonest fabric types (a\naxis is longest, c axis is shortest, b axis is intermediate):\n\na axis flow-parallel, ab plane imbricated\na axis flow-transverse, ab plane imbricated\na axis unordered, ab plane horizontal\nno strong preferred orientation\n\n2.3.4 In terms of stratification, keep in mind that conglomerates tend to be\nless well stratified than other kinds of sedimentary rocks. Conglomerates can\nshow planar stratification or cross-stratification, or they can be unstratified\n(Figure 4-7). Planar stratification in conglomerates tends to be crude, and often\nindistinct. Cross-stratification in conglomerates is always on a fairly large scale (a\nfew tens of centimeters normal to overall stratification), and it's not nearly as\ncommon as in sandstones. It's much more common for conglomerates to be un-\nstratified than for sandstones.\n\nK\ni\nn\nd\ns\n\no\nf\n\ns\nt\nr\na\nt\ni\nf\ni\nc\nation in gravels an\nd conglomerates.\n\nFigure 4-7: Kinds of stratification in gravels and conglomerates\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n2.4 Where Are Modern Gravels?\n\nrivers: especially high-gradient rivers draining mountainous areas; usually but\nnot always braided; grade over into sand-bed rivers with only a small percentage\nof gravel in the system. Typically gravel plus sand, bimodal, with sand the sec-\nondary mode; fairly well sorted but not nearly as well as beach gravels.\nalluvial fans: just another kind of braided-stream environment, but the geo-\ngraphic setting and the geometry of the depositional body are different. In addi-\ntion to the stream gravels (fanglomerates) there are debris-flow deposits on many\nfans. Debris-flow deposits are very poorly sorted mixtures of gravel, sand, and\nmud.\ntalus slopes: local, not very important\nbeaches: high-wave-energy coasts, supply of coarse clasts from marine abra-\nsion/shore erosion or fluvial source. Typically well sorted, well rounded, uni-\nmodal\nglaciers: tills, deposited directly from moving ice, and glaciofluvial deposits,\nfrom meltwater. Tills are very poorly sorted mixtures of gravel, sand, and mud,\nhard to tell from debris-flow deposits; glaciofluvial gravels are largely the same\ntexturally as nonglacial fluvial gravels.\ndeep ocean: both tractional deposits, not greatly different from fluvial gravels,\nand sediment-gravity-flow deposits, not greatly different from subaerial debris-\nflow deposits. We don't have a good understanding of either of these kinds of\ngravels, because we don't know where and when to look. Also glaciomarine de-\nposits with dropstones.\n\n2.5 Gravels vs. Sands\n\n2.5.1 Gravels and sands have a lot in common. We think of them in the\nsame way and in terms of both texture and significance (provenance, transport,\ndeposition). Both are washed and physically transported residues of rock weath-\nering. But there are some characteristic differences:\n\nComposition: gravels are dominantly rock fragments, sands are dominantly\nmineral grains\nSize distribution: the most common gravels are bimodal, the most common\nsands are unimodal.\nRounding: gravels have better rounded clasts, because gravel clasts wear down\nfaster than sand clasts\nSize trends: in most transport systems, gravels show much stronger downcurrent\nsize decrease than sands\nStratification: sands commonly show cross-bedding and/or well developed even\nbedding; gravels seldom show cross-bedding, and are much less commonly\nwell bedded than sands.\nAbundance: gravels are much less abundant than sands\nExtent: gravels are more restricted in areal extent than sands\n\n2.6 Classification\n\n2.6.1 Table 4-1 shows a classification of conglomerates. Keep in mind that\nextraformational epiclastic conglomerates are by far the most abundant deposits\nin Table 4-1. Here are some comments on them.\n\noligomict orthoconglomerates: simple composition. The only pebbles are those\nwith very resistant lithologies (mainly vein quartz, chert, quartzite). Residuum\nderived from destruction of a much larger volume of rock (all the rest went some-\nwhere as sand or mud or dissolved material). Very common in the geologic record\nbut not volumetrically abundant. Thin discontinuous beds and stringers and lenses\nat the base of a sedimentary section (basal conglomerate) and at various points\nwithin a sequence. The rest of the section is typically sands, often pebbly and\ncross-stratified. Environments: fluvial, beach.\npetromict orthoconglomerates: Most of the great conglomerates of the past.\nTend to be thick wedge-shaped basin-margin accumulations shed from high-ele-\nvation, high-relief areas, tectonically rising. Usually form a substantial percentage\nof the section. Conglomerate equivalents of arkosic and lithic sandstones. Main\nconstituents are potentially unstable rock fragments, usually several kinds. Tend\nto be coarse and thick. Clast rounding fair to good (but remember that it takes\nonly kilometers to tens of kilometers for good clast rounding). Largely alluvial-\nfan or fluvial (meandering or braided). Some are deep-water conglomerates,\napparently deposited in channels by sediment gravity flows, analogous to turbidite\nsandstones.\nparaconglomerates (also called diamictites): Larger clasts \"float\" in a poorly\nsorted matrix of mud plus sand plus finer gravel. Almost always unstratified, ex-\ncept for glaciomarine deposits. Important kinds genetically: glacial, nonglacial.\nNonglacial paraconglomerates are often difficult to tell from tillite: typically un-\nstratified, ungraded, very poorly sorted, subangular-subrounded clasts. Most seem\nto be sediment-gravity-flow deposits (high-concentration, slurrylike mixture of\nsediment and water, flowing under influence of gravity, on land and under water).\nThese are the least well understood of conglomerates. The marine kinds are typ-\nically associated with marine sandstone and shale.\n2.6.2 Intraformational conglomerates are common too, but never very vo-\nluminous. Intraformational conglomerates are formed by fragmentation and re-\ndeposition of sedimentary material only shortly after deposition (at least geologi-\ncally shortly, if not in terms of human time scales), while the sediment is unlithi-\nfied or only partly lithified. Minor episodes of stronger current, possibly also\nuplift to subaerial situation. Debris very local, little or no transportation. You can\nsee all gradations between unimportant ripping up in place to total dispersal. The\ntwo commonest types are: Clasts of shale in sandstone; clasts of fine-grained\ncarbonate rock in coarse-grained carbonate rock.\n\nTable 4-1: Classification of conglomerates\nClassification o\nf conglom\nerates.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n3. SHALES\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\n3.1.1 This section really should be entitled fine-grained detrital rocks; see\nthe section on terminology below. Here we're dealing with everything from\nfreshly deposited muds to phyllites, and grain sizes from silts to the finest clays.\n3.1.2 Shales are the most abundant of sedimentary rocks, 40-70% by various\nestimates. And you can easily see why, by considering the products of weathering\nof source rocks: clay minerals and fine-grained quartz form a very high percent-\nage of everything.\n3.1.3 Shales tend not to be as well exposed as sandstones, limestones, and\nconglomerates, because they're softer and more easily weatherable. And they're\nmuch harder to study, because they're fine-grained and complex in composition.\nOnly the coarser fraction can be studied easily under the microscope; methods for\nstudying the finer fractions of shales are highly imperfect.\n\n3.2 Kinds of Fine-Grained Deposits\n\n3.2.1 Basically there are two kinds of fine detrital deposits:\nresidual mud: Deeply weathered parent rock is transformed to largely clay-min-\neral and clay-size material, still in place. It's essentially a soil. Sometimes you\ncan still see relict textures, structures, and mineralogy of the parent rock. This\nstuff grades downward into fresher parent rock. By its very nature, there's not\nmuch of it in the geologic record (it forms a paleosol, an ancient soil preserved in\nthe sedimentary record), but when seen, it's very important for interpretation.\nWhen it's rich in aluminum hydroxide minerals, it's called bauxite, and is the main\nore of aluminum.\ntransported mud: Fine detritus is eroded from source areas and transported,\nmainly by water but also by wind and ice, to sites of deposition, mainly in the\noceans but also in lakes and rivers. This is by far the more abundant kind.\n\n3.3 Terminology\n\n3.3.1 Terminology for fine-grained detrital deposits and rocks is not well\nstandardized. Here are several terms you should be aware of:\nclay: A tricky word. It's used in three senses: size, composition, and material. In\nthe size sense, it's used for all sedimentary material finer than 1/256 mm. In\nthe compositional sense, it's used for clay minerals, a large and varied group of\nminerals, mostly sheet silicates, that are found in abundance in fine sediments.\nIn the material sense, it's used for the sticky gooey material potters use.\nsilt: sedimentary material 1/256 - 1/16 mm\nmud: silt plus clay in approximately equal proportions, or in unspecified pro-\nportions.\nshale: this common term has been used in two different ways:\n\nθ for all detrital rocks finer than sandstones (so that it's as broad a term as\nsandstone, conglomerate, or limestone), and\n\nθ for fine-grained detrital rocks that show prominent fissility and/or cleav-\nage.\n\nI'm partial to the first usage myself, and I think it's the majority usage.\nMudstone (mudrock): this term has had three usages:\n\nθ for all fine-grained detrital rocks, as a synonym of shale in the first sense\nabove;\nθ for all fine detrital rocks whose proportions of silt-size material and clay-\nsize material is not known or cannot be known; and\nθ for an indurated mud that is like shale (in the second sense above) but lacks\nfissility.\n\nI suppose I practice the second usage. I'm not sure what the majority opinion\nis.\nsiltstone: a mudstone or shale (same messiness as above) in which silt-size ma-\nterial predominates over clay-size material.\nclaystone: a mudstone or shale (same messiness as above) in which clay-size\nmaterial predominates over silt-size material.\nargillite: a fine-grained detrital rock more indurated than mudstone or shale by\nincipient metamorphism and less fissile than most mudstone and shale.\nslate: a fine-grained low-grade metamorphic rock with prominent cleavage; usu-\nally derived from shale.\n\n3.3.2 For the latest in detailed descriptive classification of shales, and a\nreview of earlier classifications, see the book by Potter, Maynard, and Pryor.\n\n3.4 Grain Size of Muds and Shales\n\n3.4.1 What can we say about the grain size of fine detrital sediments and\nsedimentary rocks? Not very much. This is one of the most troublesome problems\nof sedimentary petrology.\n\nmuds: The usual method of size analysis is settling. Problems: (1) shape and\ndensity of particles is much different from quartz spheres; (2) aggregation is\ncommon (even dominant) in original deposition, so when you disaggregate the\nsample for size analysis (that's the standard thing to do), your size analysis usu-\nally has little relevance to the original nature of the deposited particles.\nshales: diagenesis has an important effect on size distribution. To the extent that\nyou can see mineral grains under the microscope, you can estimate their size,\nbut how do you know the extent of recrystallization (even aside from the\nproblem of aggregation noted under muds above)?\n\n3.5 Typical Constituents of Shales\n\nclay minerals: dominant except in the coarser siltstones. About 60% on average,\nmaybe even more. Range from 40% to almost 100% typically.\n\nquartz: 25% on average, mainly in the silt fraction. (Most shales, even seem-\ningly very fine, have a substantial silt fraction.)\nfeldspar: also mainly in the silt sizes; more liable to be affected by diagenesis; 5-\n10% typically.\ncarbonates: about 5% on average; mainly calcite, but also dolomite and siderite\n(the last being authigenic). Calcite can come from biogenic material or\nchemically precipitated fine material in the depositional environment; you can't\ntell unless you see fossil fragments.\niron oxides: up to 5%, usually hematite; iron is in the form of oxides only when\nthe environment is oxidizing; more later.\niron sulfides: pyrite is often abundant, if the environment was reducing.\nvarious other minerals: lots of them, seldom very abundant.\nvolcanic glass: variable, minor.\namorphous silica: variable, usually minor, but abundant in the transition through\nsiliceous shale to argillaceous chert.\norganic material: ubiquitous; averages 1-2%, but sometimes up to 10-15%.\n(Important: most of the organic material in the world is in shales!)\n\n3.6 Kinds of Shales\n\n3.6.1 Here's a very unofficial tabulation of \"kinds\" of shales you're likely to\nrun into. (I don't feel bad about presenting this to you, because there's no gen-\nerally accepted classification of shales anyway.)\n\n\"common\" shales: clay minerals plus quartz, plus some other minerals, about 1%\norganic matter; Fe is in reduced state, not abundant (about 1-2%). Usually\nsome shade of gray, more or less fissile.\nred shales: dominant fine-grained part of red-bed sequences. Notably unfossil-\niferous. Most likely nonmarine: occur usually in what seem to be fluvial\ndepositional systems (more later). Red color is caused by very fine particles of\nhematite. But not much richer in Fe than common shales: up to 4-5%.\nblack (carbonaceous) shales: notably very fissile (often \"papery\"); very rich in\ncarbon (10-15%); also in FeS2, usually pyrite in fine-grained disseminated\nform (modern carbonaceous muds have several forms of FeS2 usually lumped\nunder the term hydrotroilite). Often also high concentrations of trace elements:\nV, U, Ni, Cu, etc. Deposited under anaerobic conditions. How produced is\nusually unclear: deep marine silled basins, restricted circulation of bottom\nwaters; possibility of shallow closed lagoons etc. also; Black Sea muds are of\nthis kind.\nsiliceous shales: grade over into bedded cherts; high percentage of amorphous sil-\nica. Very hard, durable, not easily weathered, not likely to be very fissile.\nSilica could be from volcanic ash falls or biogenic opaline silica.\ncalcareous shales: most shales have a very low percentage of CaCO3, but some\ngrade toward limestone (intermediate kinds are called calcareous shale through\nargillaceous limestone); rock gets less fissile, lighter weathering, fizzes,\ntypically more fossiliferous.\n\n3.7 Practical Things About Structures\n\n3.7.1 I'll say some things about structures in shales here, because more than\nin most other rocks they're on a scale small enough to be seen and studied in hand\nspecimen.\n3.7.2 Many shales are thinly laminated, on scales of the order of a millime-\nter or less. The laminae tend to be even and regular. Some likely causes:\ngrain size\norganic-matter content\ncarbonate content\n\nEach of these, especially the last two, result in alternating lighter and darker\nlaminae upon weathering.\n3.7.3 Variations in grain size might result from slight variations in supply\nfrom settling in a quiet-water environment, or from episodic influx of slightly\ncoarser material due to storms. Seasonal differences in supply might also be in-\nvoked. Seldom can you really pin anything down.\n3.7.4 Fissility is the tendency for shale (or any other sedimentary rock, for\nthat matter) to split or part along bedding planes. This is usually thought to result\nfrom greater or lesser concentrations of micaceous mineral grains lying parallel on\nbedding planes. But many shales show neither lamination nor fissility, bioturba-\ntion being a possible reason. (Bioturbation is the process of disruption of the\noriginal depositional nature of a sediment by the life activities of the epifauna and\ninfauna.) Then again, many nonfissile shales are well laminated.\n3.7.5 Slaty cleavage (or rock cleavage, or just plain cleavage) is a different\nkind of splitting tendency, developed during either diagenesis or incipient\nmetamorphism. This is generally thought to come about by reorganization and\nrealignment of micaceous mineral grains in a stress/deformation field. Often, but\nnot always, the cleavage is parallel to the axial planes of folds.\n\n3.8 Clay Mineralogy\n\n3 .8.1 General\n3.8.1.1 The clay minerals are a varied group of silicate minerals, mostly\nphyllosilicates (sheet silicates), that tend to be found as very fine particles, of the\norder of microns to small fractions of a micron, in fine sediments. There are\nseveral important varieties, none of which is dominant. Their proportions vary\ndepending upon source-rock composition, weathering environment, and di-\nagenesis.\n3.8.1.2 As you can imagine, clay minerals are not easy to study: even in the\ncoarser size range it's difficult to see them microscopically. Standard techniques\nfor study include electron microscopy, which allows you to see the particle shapes\nbeautifully, and x-ray diffraction, which allows you to identify their mineralogy,\nafter a fashion. Probe techniques have been developed more recently. A\ncomplicating factor is isomorphous substitution among iron, magnesium, silicon,\n\nand aluminum in various ion sites in most of the clay minerals, leading to a great\nrange of compositions.\n3.8.1.3 Clay mineralogy is worth a whole course in itself. What I'll do here\nis just give you a cursory account of the most important clay minerals and their\noccurrence.\n\n3 .8.2 Structure\n3.8.2.1 Two structural units are involved in clay-mineral structures:\n\noctahedral sheets: two planes of closely packed oxygens and hydroxyls with a\nplane of Al, Fe, and/or Mg between. The Al, Fe, and/or Mg are in octahedral\ncoordination with the O and OH; that is, each of the former is equidistant from six\nof the latter, which are arranged as an octahedron around the former. Figure 4-8\nshows a rough sketch of the arrangement. Figure 4-9 is a more detailed view of\nthe geometry, perpendicular to the sheet. The oxygen-to-oxygen distance is 2.94\nA, and the thickness of the sheet is 5.05 A. If Al is in the octahedral positions,\nonly two-thirds of the positions are filled; if Mg and/or Fe are in the octahedral\npositions, all of the positions are filled. Arrangement of atoms in the octahedral sheet.\nM\no\nr\ne\n\nd\ne\nt\na\ni\nl\ne\nd\nview of t\nhe octahedral she\net.\n\nFigure 4-9: More detailed view of the geometry of the octahedral sheet of clay-mineral\nstructures\nFigure 4-8: Sketch of the arrangement of atoms in the octahedral sheet of clay-mineral\nstructures\nFigure by MIT OCW. Arrangement of atoms in the octahedral sheet.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\ntetrahedral sheets, in which silica (SiO4) tetrahedra are polymerized by sharing\nof three of the four oxygens to form a sheet structure with hexagonal symmetry.\nFigure 4-10 shows two diagrammatic representations. The oxygen-to-oxygen dis-\ntance is 2.55 A, and the thickness of the sheet is 4.65 A.\n\nA\nr\nr\na\nn\ng\ne\nm\ne\nnt of silica tetrahedra.\n\nFigure 4-10: Diagrammatic representations of the arrangement of silica tetrahedra in the\ntetrahedral sheet of clay-mineral structures\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n3.8.2.2 These two layers, or sheetlike arrangements, fit together, one on top\nof the other, in such a way that the vertices of the tetrahedra in the tetrahedral\nsheet point toward the octahedral sheet. The unshared oxygens of the tetrahedral\nsheet and the oxygens of the octahedral sheet are the same; they are shared for\ndouble duty. The hydroxyls that form part of the octahedral arrangement fit into\nthe hexagonal holes of the tetrahedral sheet.\n3.8.2.3 The dimensions of the two sheets are almost but not quite right for\nthis shared arrangement. There has to be some strain in the lattices to make them\ngo together to share oxygens. This seems to be accommodated by alternate\ncocking of the tetrahedra, to contract the tetrahedral sheet a little, and stretching\nand thinning of the octahedral sheet to make it a little bigger. I'll schematize this\ntwo-layer structure as shown in Figure 4-11.\n\nC\no\nm\nb\ni\nn\nation of octahedral and tetrahedral sheets in 2-layer structures.\n\nFigure 4-11: Sketch of the combination of octahedral and tetrahedral sheets in two-layer\nday-mineral structures\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n3.8.2.4 It's also possible to construct a three-layer arrangement in which a\ntetrahedral layer is sandwiched between two tetrahedral layers. Figure 4-12 shows\nthe highly schematic way I'll represent this three-layer structure.\n\nC\no\nm\nb\ni\nn\na\nt\nion of octahedral and tetrahedral sheets in 3-layer structures.\n\n3.8.3 Classification\n\n3.8.3.1 The structural classification of sheet-silicate clay minerals is based\non the octahedral-tetrahedral layer structure outlined above.\n\nK aolinite\nKaolinite is the main two-layer mineral. It's fairly simple chemically:\nAl4(Si4O10)(OH)8, with no isomorphous substitutions; it's the purest of the clay\nminerals.\nOnly two-thirds of the octahedral positions are filled, by aluminum; minerals\nlike that are called dioctahedral. A consequence of this partial emptiness is that\nthere can be geometrically different stacking arrangements of the layers, leading\nto polymorphism. There are two such stacking polymorphs, dickite and nacrite,\nneither of which is nearly as common as kaolinite. The whole group of like\nminerals, kaolinite plus its two stacking polymorphs, is sometimes called the\nkandite group.\nThere's no net charge on the tetrahedral-octahedral layers; the layers are\nheld together only by van der Waals bonds. The repeat distance normal to the\nlayers is 7.2 A, so this group of minerals is sometimes called seven-Angstrom\nclays.\nThe crystals can get fairly large, up to tens of microns, because there's very\nlittle stress in the structure; kaolinite is the coarsest of the clay minerals.\nThere's also a hydrated form of kaolinite, called halloysite, with a single\nlayer of water molecules between the layers; this disorders the stacking and in-\ncreases the interlayer spacing to about 10 A.\nKaolinite is formed mainly by weathering of feldspars; production of\nkaolinite is favored by acidic and warm environments.\n\nFigure 4-12: Sketch of the combination of octahedral in three-layer clay-mineral\nstructures and tetrahedral sheets\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nI llite\nIllite is a hydrous muscovite-like clay mineral. It has the same three-layer\nstructure as muscovite, but less than the one-in-four replacement of Si by Al that's\ncharacteristic of muscovite (the figure is between one-in-five and one-in-six). So\nthere isn't the same charge deficiency as in muscovite, and not as many K+ ions in\nthe interlayer positions. H3O+ ions are also present in the interlayer positions.\nAlso, substitutions in the octahedral layer are greater and more random; there's lots\nof variability.\nIllite is never found well crystallized, only as clay-size particles. The particle\nsize is typically less than one micron. This is because there's considerable stress in\nthe layers.\nAs with the other micas, there are polymorphs resulting from different\nstacking symmetry of the TOT layers: 1M (one-repeat-layer monoclinic), 2M\n(two-repeat-layer monoclinic), 3T (three-repeat-layer tetragonal), etc. But usually\nthese are hard to identify in illites.\nIllite-sericite-muscovite are all similar, and called white mica; there's pro-\ngressively less Al substitution and therefore less interlayer K+ and more interlayer\nwater. There are no well defined boundaries, but the term muscovite is used for\nmetamorphic stuff, the term sericite is customarily used for diagenetic or incipi-\nently metamorphic stuff, and the term illite is used for clay minerals in sediments\nand also in sedimentary rocks. There's considerable overlap in usage, however.\nIllite is formed mainly by weathering of Kspar in temperate weathering envi-\nronments. With increasing intensity of weathering, kaolinite is formed instead.\n\nM\nontmorillonite\nTechnically montmorillonite is one important mineral in what's called the\nsmectite group. Montmorillonite is a clay mineral which like illite has the basic\nmuscovite arrangement but which is able to expand by taking up a lot of water (or\nother polar molecules) in the interlayer positions. The reason is that the bonds be-\ntween the TOT units are weaker, because of details of stacking of the layers, and\nalso because the charge imbalance is located mainly in the interior octahedral layer\nrather than in the outer tetrahedral layers. When the mineral is collapsed the layer\nspacing is 9.6 A, but when fully expanded it's almost 20 A.\nMontmorillonite has variable percentages of large cations, Ca++ and Na+, in\nthe interlayer positions. There's substitution of Al for Si in the tetrahedral layer,\nand variable proportions of Fe++, Mg++, and Al3+ in the octahedral layer.\nMontmorillonite is formed by the weathering of plagioclase, ferromagnesian\naluminosilicates, and volcanic glass; its development is favored by alkaline en-\nvironments.\n\nC hlorite\nChlorite is the most important regular mixed-layer clay mineral. Its structure\nis an alternation of trioctahedral TOT layers, with Mg++ and Fe++ in the octahedral\npositions, and brucite layers, with the composition (Mg++, Fe++)3(OH)6, giving a\n\nrepeat spacing of about 14 A. There's a great range and diversity of ionic substitu-\ntions in each of the three ion sites, as well as stacking polymorphs.\nSo chlorites are very complicated. Bonding between layers is by van der\nWaals bonds. Chlorite is produced in abundance only in relatively mild weath-\nering environments, where it survives from the source rocks, although in the form\nof finer particles. So it's characteristically a high-latitude product.\n\nR andom mixed-layer minerals\nSeveral combinations of clay minerals will interlayer randomly, because of\ngenerally similar basic atomic structure of all the sheet-silicate clay minerals.\nThese minerals can be almost as stable as the single-layer minerals; they're abun-\ndant in both modern sediments and ancient rocks, although there's a tendency for\nregularization as diagenesis becomes stronger. Important kinds:\nillite-kaolinite\nchlorite-kaolinite\nchlorite-vermiculite\n\nA morphous clay minerals\nThese are clay minerals with little or no x-ray diffraction effects, although ap-\nparently more ordered than just glass. Si is in tetrahedral coordination with oxy-\ngen, and Al, Fe, and Mg are in octahedral coordination with oxygen, but there's no\nregular longer-range structure.\nThere has been considerable difference of opinion about how important such\nminerals are. One reason is that they are very difficult to identify, especially when\nmixed with better-ordered clay minerals. In any case, they readily become better\norganized upon burial.\n3.8.3.2 Figure 4-13 shows crude sketches of structural organization of the\nclay minerals.\nS\nt\nr\nu\nc\nt\nu\nr\na\nl\n\no\nr\ng\na\nn\ni\nz\na\nt\nion of c\nlay minerals.\n\nFigure 4-13: Sketches of the structural organization of clay minerals\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n4. VOLCANICLASTIC ROCKS\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\n4.1.1 Particulate volcanic material, once out of the ground, is in fact sed-\nimentary material, so all pyroclastic rocks could be treated as sedimentary rocks.\n(I'm not recommending that you do this, however.) And commonly they're in-\nterbedded with strictly sedimentary rocks. Also, pyroclastic volcanic rocks grade\nover--both case by case and also in a given area--into sedimentary rocks sensu\nstricto composed largely or entirely of pyroclastic material.\n\n4.2 Where are Volcanoes?\n\n4.2.1 Mainly in the following kinds of places:\nmid-ocean ridges, basalt; sedimentologically unimportant\nsubduction zones (\"mobile belts\" or \"geosynclines\" in the ancient); andesites,\nfelsites; at continental margins; sedimentologically very important.\ncratons, basalts etc.; sedimentologically not very important\n\n4.3 What Comes Out of Volcanoes?\n\n4.3.1 Table 4-2 shows an idealized spectrum of volcanoes. From Table 4-2\nyou should expect that the sedimentologically important volcanic material is felsic\npyroclastics.\n4.3.2 Particulate components that come out of volcanoes (all of which is\ncalled tephra):\nvolcanic glass: shards (curved spicule-like forms, bubble-wall fragments),\npumice (porous gas-filled solidified froth)\ncrystals: mostly phenocrysts separated out of the magma; quartz (euhedral, often\nembayed); plagioclase (often zoned); Kspar; lots of biotite flakes; hornblende,\naugite, etc.\nvolcanic rock fragments: cognate (lava broken up by later events); accidental\n(wall-rock blocks, mainly aphanitic felsic rocks).\n4.3.3 Two important terms:\nvolcaniclastic: used for all fragmental volcanic rocks, any mechanism of origin,\nany depositional environment, any admixture of nonvolcanic components, but\nusually only if the volcanic component is dominant.\npyroclastic: used for rocks produced by explosive ejection of volcanic material\nfrom a volcanic vent.\n\nIdealized spectrum of volcanoes.\n\nbombs: >32 mm objects formed by solidification of lava in flight; rounded, often\nwith \"bread-crust\" surface; a deposit of bombs is called an agglomerate.\nlapilli: 4-32 mm volcanic materials; deposit is lapilli tuff\nash: <4 mm volcanic particulate materials; deposit is called tuff\n\n4.4.2 The term tuff is used for lithified deposits of tephra; it's usually used\njust for ash-size deposits. Tuff can also be classified the basis of nature of\nparticles: vitric tuff, crystal tuff, lithic tuff.\n4.5 Kinds of Volcaniclastic Rocks\n\npyroclastic deposits: sediment deposited directly from volcanic emanations, in\nvarious ways. These are commonly interbedded with \"normal\" sedimentary\nrocks.\nreworked pyroclastic deposits: newly deposited pyroclastic material reworked\nby water (in rivers or in shallow-marine environments); the material is\npyroclastic, but the structure is epiclastic (produced by surficial processes);\nalso included are debris-flow deposits. These grade continuously into\n\"normal\" sedimentary rocks.\nerosional volcaniclastic deposits: sediments deposited in normal ways by ero-\nsion of volcanic source rocks. These grade continuously into \"normal\" sedi-\nmentary rocks, and differ from them only in that most of the material is vol-\ncanic.\n\n4.6 Modes of Deposition of Pyroclastics\n\nAsh falls: pyroclastic material is ejected \"loose\" into the atmosphere and settles\nback to earth particle by particle. The material is dispersed in an oblong fan\ndownwind; grain size and thickness vary regularly. The deposit becomes fairly\nwell sorted by fractionation by settling velocity. The deposit can cover hundreds\nto thousands of square kilometers, and forms key beds that lap across different\ngeological provinces. The material can fall either onto land or into water bodies,\nresulting in air-fall and water-laid deposits. How do you tell these apart? If the\nwater-laid material experiences no currents greater than threshold, it would be\ndifficult.\nAsh flows (also called nuees ardentes): Basically a subaerial density current.\nThe eruption produces a cloud of glowing particles and gas, at temperatures of\n500-1000° C, which acts as a heavy fluid and flows down slopes at speeds of tens\nof meters per second. Such flows travel tens of kilometers or even more. The\ndeposit often becomes welded after deposition (hence the term welded tuff),\nbecause heat doesn't escape immediately, resulting in a welded tuff. Many rhyo-\nlites turn out to be welded tuffs when their texture is examined closely. Such de-\nposits can also be submarine. These deposits are also called ignimbrites.\nBase-surge deposits: high-velocity, steam-laden, horizontally moving eruptive\nclouds, basically an explosion phenomenon; they're seen also in large artificial\nexplosions like nuclear blasts. They can leave antidune cross-stratification! (And\ngood overall stratification.) Sometimes the deposit contains airfall blocks\nanalogous to dropstones in a glaciomarine deposit.\n\n4.4 Classification of Pyroclastic Material\n\n4.4.1 The generic term for solid particulate material that comes out of\nvolcanic vents is tephra. Here's a breakdown of tephra by particle size:\nblocks: >32 mm fragments, broken from previously consolidated lava; tends to be\nangular\n\nTuffs weather readily. They have high porosity, large surface area, and\nchemically reactive volcanic composition. Feldspar weathers to kaolinite as soft\nearthy masses; glass weathers to silica in solution, zeolites, clay minerals; femags\nweather to dissolved silica, ions, and clay minerals. The ash readily loses its dis-\ntinctive character. When completely altered, many ash beds are converted to ben-\ntonite (a material usually consisting almost entirely of the clay mineral mont-\nmorillonite).\n\n4.7 Erosional Volcaniclastics\n\n4.7.1 These are the rocks you're most likely to deal with in a sedimentary\ncontext. The nature of the rocks and the range of characteristics are the same as\nfor nonvolcaniclastic sediments, but the composition of the particles is distinctive.\n4.7.2 Typical constituents:\n\nvolcanically derived crystals: quartz, feldspar, etc. (even olivine)\nglassy material, but readily weathered\nrock fragments: gravel size, sand size\n\n4.7.3 This stuff is weathered, eroded, transported by \"ordinary\" mechanisms,\nand then deposited in rivers, coastal environments, and marine environments.\n4.7.4 One very characteristic kind of volcaniclastic deposit is debris flows:\nThese are unusually important in volcanic areas because of removal of vegetation\ncover then rapid erosion by heavy rains, and development of a high-concentration\nslurry. The term lahar is used for large debris flows generated by heavy rain in\nan ash-covered landscape. Lahar deposits show no stratification or sorting, with\nclasts of all sizes in a tuffaceous matrix. How would you tell lahar deposits from\nash flows? No welding; pumice not collapsed; possibly more nonvolcanic stuff.\n4.7.5 Other kinds of volcaniclastic deposits (not especially exciting):\nfluvial deposits\nbeach deposits\noffshore sands\nturbidites\n\n4.7.6 Deposits commonly found interbedded in a volcanic area:\nlava flows\nash flows\nlahar deposits\nerosional volcaniclastics\nother sedimentary rocks\nsoil horizons\n\n4.7.7 Away from the immediate area of volcanism, one tends to find ash\nbeds representing ash falls (constituting a very minor proportion of the section)\ninterbedded with \"normal\" sedimentary rocks."

      "content": "Chapter 5\nLIMESTONES\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Something like about one-fifth of all sedimentary rocks are carbonate\nrocks. The two main kinds of carbonate rocks, limestones and dolostones,\ntogether with sandstones and shales, are what might be called the \"big four\" of\nsedimentary rock types. I'm reluctant to try to guess what percentage of all\nsedimentary rocks those \"big four\" account for, but the figure must be in the upper\nnineties. Moreover, carbonate rocks are economically important because together\nwith sandstones they constitute reservoirs for most of the world's petroleum and\ngas reserves (and let's not forget that they are the source of all of the world's\nportland cement--not a jazzy, exciting resource, but a very important one for our\nmodern civilization).\n1.2 Up until about fifty years ago, the petrologic study of carbonate rocks\nlagged far behind that of siliciclastic rocks. Since that time, however, there has\nbeen great progress, as it has become realized that to a great extent carbonate\nrocks can be treated as clastic deposits analogous to sandstones and shales (the\nmain exception being reef limestones). Great progress has also been made in\nrecent years on the geochemistry of carbonate precipitation, the role of organisms\nin carbonate deposition, and the diagenesis of carbonate sediments.\n1.3 Carbonate sediments are often described as chemically precipitated. In\none sense, that's true: they are formed by precipitation of one or another\ncarbonate mineral in various sedimentary environments. But don't let the term\n\"chemically precipitated\" fool you: they don't form in the same way that rock\ncandy does from a sugar solution on your windowsill. Some carbonate sediments\nare indeed precipitated directly from seawater, in the form of fine crystals in the\nwater column, which then settle to the seafloor, or as successive spherical shells\ndeposited around a nucleus particle in a warm, shallow marine environment.\nMost, however, are biochemically precipitated, in the tissues of organisms, mainly\nmarine invertebrates of various phyla.\n1.4 The title of this chapter could have been \"carbonate rocks\", but it seems\nsomewhat more natural to restrict it to limestones. You will learn that dolomite is\nalmost invariably a secondary rather than a primary sedimentary mineral, meaning\nthat carbonate sediments don't start their lives as dolomite. Much dolomite is\nprecipitated very early, however, at shallow depths in the originally calcium\ncarbonate sediment, although much is also precipitated late, after deep burial has\nproduced solid limestone. Material on dolostone (a carbonate rock consisting\nmainly of the mineral dolomite) is postponed until the later chapter on diagenesis.\n\n2. CARBONATE MINERALS\n2.1 About sixty minerals have the carbonate ion in their composition. But\nthere are only three really important carbonate minerals: calcite, aragonite, and\ndolomite. (In the parlance of mineralogy, the first two are said to be polymorphs.)\nAnd aragonite is unimportant in ancient rocks, because it reverts to calcite with\ntime. Other sedimentary carbonates of non-negligible importance are magnesite\n(magnesium carbonate) and siderite (ferrous iron carbonate). Dolomites\ncontaining some percentage of Fe2+ are called ferroan dolomite. The middle\nmember of the range between dolomite and hypothetical (Fe, Ca)(CO3)2 is called\nankerite. There are also a few significant carbonate evaporite minerals (trona,\nnatron) we won't consider here.\n2.2 Figure 5-1 is a composition triangle showing the range of carbonate\nminerals stable at the low temperatures at or near the Earth's surface. It's in terms\nof the three divalent positive ions, Ca2+ (0.99 A), Mg2+ (0.66 A), and Fe2+ (0.74\nA), that are abundant and of about the right size to fit into carbonate structures.\n(Remember that one angstrom is equal to 10-10 meters, or 0.1 nanometers.)\n\nComposition triangle.\n\n2.5 Most of the calcite precipitated by marine organisms contains a certain\npercentage of magnesium. Such calcite is called magnesian calcite; it's\nsubdivided into low-magnesium calcite and high-magnesium calcite at 4%\nMgCO3 content. Generally the more advanced the organism, the less magnesium\nin the calcite. In the case of red algae, an important sediment producer, the\npercentage is as much as 25%. Magnesian calcite is unstable, and it eventually\nexpels its magnesium, but that takes a long time.\n2.6 The effective ionic radii of Fe2+ and Mg2+ are almost the same, so these\ntwo ions substitute for each other in any proportion. There is complete\nisomorphism between magnesite and siderite, and also between dolomite and the\niron equivalent, called ferroan dolomite. So you should expect most dolomite to\ncontain at least some iron. This is why dolostones are typically tan-weathering, in\ncontrast to usually gray-weathering limestone.\n2.7 The other calcium carbonate mineral, aragonite, has an entirely different\nstructure with orthorhombic symmetry. Aragonite can't tolerate even a few\npercent Mg2+ or Fe2+, but it can take some Sr2+ and Ba2+, which have much larger\neffective sizes. Also, some SO4\n2- sulfate ions can replace the carbonate ions.\n2.8 Aragonite is the high-pressure form of calcium carbonate, and calcite is\nthe theoretically stable form under all sedimentary conditions. But in most\nsedimentary environments aragonite is precipitated rather than calcite. The\nexception is purely fresh-water inorganic precipitation, which is of minor\nsedimentological importance. Supersaturation, warm water, and the presence of\nsulfate and magnesium ions tend to promote precipitation of aragonite instead of\ncalcite. Aragonite eventually reverts to calcite, but it sometimes takes a long time;\nwhere sealed in sulfate-rich impermeable rocks, aragonite has in some cases been\nfound in rocks even as old as the late Paleozoic.\n\n3. THE CARBONATE BUDGET OF THE OCEANS\n3.1 Calcite is more stable in pure water than its polymorph aragonite, so if\nthe carbonate system in the oceans obeyed thermodynamics, calcite rather than\naragonite should be precipitated. But it's observed that aragonite is precipitated\ninstead. In the case of inorganic precipitation of aragonite, probably this has to do\nwith the presence of other kinds of ions, like sulfate and magnesium, in sea water.\nThese ions act as kinetic inhibitors and serve to impede the growth of calcite. In\nthe case of biogenic precipitation, organisms also seem to disregard the laws of\nthermodynamics, and deposit either calcite or aragonite, or both at the same time,\nor one at one time and one at another. Some details follow.\n\ncalcareous algae: Halimeda and other green algae, aragonite; Lithothamnium\nand other reef-making red algae, calcite\nmodern corals (hexacorals): aragonite\n\nPaleozoic corals (rugose corals, tabulate corals): probably calcite, by good\npreservation of structures\nbrachiopods, bryozoans, foraminifera: calcite then and now\nechinoderms: calcite then and now; large single-crystal skeletal components,\nvery durable\ntrilobites: probably calcite, by good preservation of structures\nmollusks: mostly aragonite, sometimes partly or entirely calcite\n\n3.2 At present, most of the open surface waters of the oceans, except at high\nlatitudes, are about saturated or even supersaturated with respect to CaCO3, so\nthere must be at least a broad inorganic control on precipitation of CaCO3. Figure\n5-2 shows the degree of saturation of aragonite and calcite with depth for both the\nAtlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. It's not known how long things have been\nthis way, but judging from the overall similarity of present deposits and past\ndeposits, the situation has probably been the same at least back into the\nPrecambrian. In the Precambrian, the saturation of seawater with calcium car-\nbonate may have been the highest of all time, because of much higher levels of\nCO2 in the atmosphere. Degree of saturation of calcite and aragonite.\n\n3.3 By river contributions of dissolved load from rock weathering on the\ncontinents, the doubling time of Ca2+ in the oceans should be about a million\nyears. (By the doubling time is meant the time it would take for the concentration\nof a given substance to increase by a factor of two if no other process is at work to\nremove the substance at the same time.) Obviously something must be taking it\nout at about the same rate. The same is true for Mg2+ ion, but the doubling time is\n\nFigure 5-2: Degree of saturation with respect to calcite and aragonite with depth in the\nAtlantic arid Pacific Oceans\nATLANTIC OCEAN\nPACIFIC OCEAN\nATLANTIC OCEAN\nPACIFIC OCEAN\nDEPTH\nKm\nDEPTH\nKm\n.5 .6 .8 1.0\n1.5 2.0\n3.0 4.0 5.0 7.0\n.3\n.4 .5 .6 .8 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\nDEGREE OF SATURATION, CALCITE\nDEGREE OF SATURATION, ARAGONITE\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nabout an order of magnitude greater, something like twenty million years. In the\ncase of calcium ion, the obvious process by which it's removed from solution is\nprecipitation of carbonate minerals. For magnesium ion, however, the removal\nprocess is less obvious--because, as you will see presently, dolomite is being\nprecipitated as a primary sedimentary mineral almost not at all in the modern\noceans. It's known that Mg is removed from seawater very efficiently by reaction\nof the seawater with freshly crystallized basalt at and near mid-ocean ridges.\nAlso, in shallow-water carbonate-producing environments the magnesium in\nsolution is buried with the calcium carbonate sediments, where, with time, during\nshallow-burial diagenesis, it dolomitizes the calcium carbonate minerals--about\nwhich you will learn more in the later chapter on diagenesis.\n3.4 As for the entire ocean bottom, about one gram of CaCO3 is deposited\nper square centimeter of ocean bottom per 1000 years on the average, on the basis\nof balance considerations. Over large areas, however, no carbonate is being\ndeposited at all, whereas in other places the rates of accumulation are far greater\nthan the average.\n3.5 The rate of deposition of CaCO3 is much greater in shallow ocean than\nin the deep ocean, but the volume of newly deposited shallow-water CaCO3 is far\nsmaller than that of deep- sea CaCO3. But this is true only for the present time:\nplanktonic carbonate-secreting organisms evolved late in geologic history, in the\nMesozoic, so the volume of shallow-water CaCO3 must have been much greater in\nthe Precambrian and the Paleozoic than now (on the reasonable assumption that\nthe rate of supply of dissolved calcium ion was about the same).\n3.6 Another point worth noting here is that, from the standpoint of long-term\ngeologic history, deep-sea storage of carbonate is only temporary: sea-floor\nspreading and subduction of oceanic lithosphere at continental margins provides a\nvery satisfying way of reincorporating deep-sea carbonate deposits into the\ngeological record of the continents, albeit usually in unrecognizable form. Before\nthe plate-tectonics revolution in the 1960s, geologists believed that what was put\ninto the deep ocean stayed there forever!\n\n4. GEOCHEMISTRY OF CARBONATE PRECIPITATION\n\n4.1 Precipitation of carbonate in natural waters is more complicated than that\nof, say, halides or sulfates, because of the dissolution of carbon dioxide in natural\nwaters. Here are the reactions that are relevant to carbonate precipitation:\n\nCO2 (gas) + H2O ⇔ CO2 (aqueous solution) + H2O\nCO2 + H2O ⇔ H2CO3 (carbonic acid, about 1%)\nH2CO3 ⇔ H+ + HCO3\n- K = 4.3 x 10-7\n\nHCO3\n- ⇔ H+ + CO3\n2- K = 4.8 x 10-11\nCaCO3 (calcite) ⇔ Ca2+ + CO3\n2- K = 3.8 x 10-9\nCaCO3 (aragonite) ⇔ Ca2+ + CO3\n2- K = 6.0 x 10-9\n\nBACKGROUND: EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANTS\nYou probably can recall from some earlier chemistry course that for a\nchemical reaction\n\naA + bB ⇔ cC + dD\n\nwhere, if the reaction goes to the right, A and B are called the reactants and C and\nD are called the products (whereas if the reaction goes to the left, A and B are the\nproducts and C and D are the reactants), and the coefficients a, b, c, and d are the\nnumbers of atoms or ions involved in the reaction, the equilibrium constant K is\n\n([A]a[B]b)/([C]c[D]d)\n\nwhere the square brackets signify the concentrations (technically, the activities,\nbut in dilute solutions the two are not greatly different) of the various substances.\nIf the equilibrium constant for a given reaction is small, that means that at\nequilibrium (that is, the reaction is proceeding just as fast to the left as to the right,\nso the concentrations of the various substances remain the same through time) the\nconcentrations of the substances on the right side of the reaction are smaller than\nthe concentrations of the substances on the left side of the reaction.\n\n4.2 There are various ways of adding these reactions, but the way that's most\nrelevant to carbonate precipitation in the oceans is\n\nCaCO3 (solid) + H2O + CO2 ⇔ Ca2+ + 2CO3\n2- + 2H+\n\nSo\n\nanything that increases the concentration of dissolved CO2 tends to cause\ndissolution of calcium carbonate,\n\nand\n\nanything that decreases the concentration of dissolved CO2 tends to cause\nprecipitation of calcium carbonate.\n\nThe two most important effects are:\n\ntemperature: as the water temperature increases, the equilibrium solubility\nof CO2 decreases, so as sea water is warmed there is a tendency for CO2 to be\nreleased back into the atmosphere and for CaCO3 to be precipitated.\nphotosynthesis: in photosynthesis, plants take up CO2 from the environment\nand fix it in organic compounds in their tissues, thereby releasing oxygen.\n\n4.3 Another important factor is this: carbonate-secreting marine\ninvertebrates live in greatest numbers in the warm shallow parts of the oceans.\nThese organisms can secrete CaCO3 even from water that is not saturated in\nCaCO3, but they do it best and most abundantly where the water is saturated.\n4.4 So it makes sense that most of the CaCO3 precipitated in the oceans\ntoday is in warm, shallow water, where the water is warmed, so that the concentra-\ntion of dissolved CO2 is lowered and saturation with respect to CaCO3 is thus\nenhanced, and where aquatic plants (largely algae) flourish.\n4.5 In summary, there is a broad inorganic control on carbonate\nprecipitation in the oceans, but the specific controls have to do with local water\ntemperature and photosynthesis.\n4.6 So far in this section we have addressed only the precipitation or\ndissolution of the calcium carbonate minerals. How about the mineral dolomite?\nTo deal with precipitation of dolomite, we have to think about undersaturation\nand oversaturation (also called supersaturation). Suppose you put a piece of\ncalcite in a beaker of distilled water, and for the sake of simplicity you arrange that\nno carbon dioxide is dissolved in the water. You know what will happen: the\ncalcite dissolves slowly, and, as it does, the concentrations of dissolved Ca2+ ions\nand CO3\n2- ions increase The solution is said to be undersaturated with respect to\ncalcite. Eventually (and it would take months), the reaction reaches equilibrium,\nwhereupon the concentrations of the Ca2+ ions and the CO3\n2- ions reach constant\nvalues. If, however, we somehow pump Ca2+ ions into the solution, we drive the\nreaction toward precipitation of calcite. The solution is said to be oversaturated.\n4.7 We can think separately about the saturation state of calcite (or\naragonite) in seawater and about the saturation state of dolomite in seawater. The\nconventional way of doing that is to define a quantity variously called the solution\nquotient or the mass action quotient or the ion activity product (the last designated\nIAP), which has exactly the same form as the equilibrium constant but the\nconcentrations are those that exist at a given time in the solution, whether the\n\nsolution is in equilibrium (the state of saturation) or undersaturated or\noversaturated. If the solution is oversaturated, then the IAP is greater than the\nequilibrium constant K; if the solution is undersaturated, then the IAP is less than\nthe equilibrium constant K.\n4.8 It turns out that in warm, shallow seawater (the part of the oceans that is\nmost relevant to precipitation of carbonate minerals, as you saw above), all three\nof the important carbonate minerals--calcite, aragonite, and dolomite--are in a\nstate of oversaturation: that is, the situation should be conducive to precipitation.\nYou have seen that calcite or aragonite are indeed precipitated, but dolomite is not.\nYet, perhaps surprisingly, the ratio IAP/K for the three minerals is as follows:\n\nAragonite: 2.1\nCalcite: 3.3\nDolomite: 55\n\n4.9 Seawater is far more oversaturated with respect to dolomite than it is\nwith respect to aragonite and calcite! How, then, can we account for this\nseemingly paradoxical situation? We need to think not just about the equilibrium\nof chemical reactions but also about the kinetics of chemical reactions. Ionic\ncrystals are built ion by ion, at some rate. Building of crystals of minerals with a\ngreater degree of ionic ordering is inherently slower--more difficult-- than that of\ncrystals with a lesser degree of ordering. Dolomite has a much more highly\nordered structure than does calcite or aragonite, inasmuch as in dolomite, in\ncontrast to the two calcium carbonate minerals, the calciums and the magnesiums\nneed to be in a regularly alternating array. Reaction kinetics is the basic reason\nwhy dolomite, despite its great oversaturation, is not precipitated from seawater:\nit loses out in the kinetic competition. And this must have been true in the\ngeologic past as well as at present.\n4.10 Another way of looking at dissolution of calcite is to write a reaction\nthat pertains to rapid dissolution in the presence of hydrogen ions:\n\nCaCO3 (solid) + 2H+ ⇒ Ca2+ + CO2 + H2O\n\nWhat's going on here is that the calcite dissolves in acidic waters to release\ncalcium ions and carbon dioxide gas. That's what happens when we add ground-\nup limestone to our lawns and gardens to decrease the acidity of the soil. It's also\nwhat happens when we use our little bottle of dilute hydrochloric acid in the field\nto test whether a given rock is a limestone. When I was an undergrad, I worked in\nmy advisor's paleontology laboratory, where we dissolved large blocks of\nlimestone containing silicified fossils by painting the bottom surface of the block\nwith a plastic resin and then putting the block in a tub of dilute hydrochloric acid\nin a fume hood. After the entire block was dissolved, we rinsed the residue and\npicked the silicified fossils with tweezers under a microscope. The topic of\nsilicification will appear is a later chapter. (As a final note, the above reaction can\nalso be used to account for the gradual dissolution of marble monuments and\ngravestones by acidic rainwater.)\n\n5. MODERN MARINE CARBONATE SEDIMENTS\n\n5.1 Carbonate sediments are forming today on many parts of the ocean\nbottom, according to definite but complex controls. Presumably this has been so\nthroughout much of geologic history, but because organisms do most of (or, at\nleast, are ultimately responsible for) the deposition, the controls must have\nchanged through time as the organisms evolved.\n\n5.2 Carbonate deposits are most abundant between about 30° N and 30° S.\n(They are not restricted to that zone, though: the topic of cold-water carbonates is\nan active area of research nowadays.) The low-latitude regions are where the\nsurface waters tend to be saturated with respect to CaCO3, and where the water is\nwarm enough the year round for carbonate-secreting organisms to flourish. But\nthis picture is obviously complicated in detail, by patterns of ocean currents,\nnutrient supply, and dilution by siliciclastic sediments.\n5.3 There are three main classes of modern marine carbonate sediments:\n\n- calcareous oozes in the deep ocean\n- carbonate buildups\n- calcareous sand and mud on platforms (shelf and ramp carbonates)\n\n6. CALCAREOUS OOZE\n\n6.1 More than a third of the present deep ocean bottom is covered with\nsediment containing more than 30% CaCO3. The carbonate in these sediments is\nin the form of tiny shells or tests of various carbonate-secreting planktonic\norganisms that live in the warm shallow waters above. Such deposits are called\nooze; there is calcareous ooze and siliceous ooze, depending upon what the\norganisms secrete.\n6.2 The most abundant kind of calcareous ooze is foraminiferal ooze.\nForaminifera are single-celled protozans. In the oceans of today there are about\nthirty species of foraminifera (forams, for short) belonging to two families,\nGlobigerinidae and Globorotaliidae. These are the only two of more than fifty\nforam families that are adapted to a planktonic rather than a benthic mode of life.\nBut these planktonic forams grow in enormous numbers in the warm shallow\nwaters of the ocean. At subdividing time the protoplasm of each foram subdivides\ninto zoospores that swarm out to develop into new forams, leaving the empty test\nto sink to the bottom. So very little organic matter goes down with the tests.\nFigure 5-3: (left) Brasier, M.D., 1980, Microfossils: George Allen & Unwin, 193\np. (Figure 13.27g, p. 116). (center) Brasier, M.D., 1980, Microfossils: George\nAllen & Unwin, 193 p. (Figure 13.27e, p. 116) (right) Boersma, A., 1978,\nForaminifera, in Haq, B.U., and Boersma, A., Introduction to Marine\nMicropaleontology: Elsevier, 376 p. (Appendix I, p. 69-75) shows what some\nplanktonic forams look like.\n6.3 Because of the greater solubility of CaCO3 in the colder deeper waters,\nwhich are derived from cold polar regions and thus contain more dissolved CO2,\nbelow a certain depth the foram tests are completely dissolved before they have a\nchance to be covered by more tests. Figure 5-4 is a graph of CaCO3 content of\nbottom sediments vs. depth.\n\nC\na\nC\nO\n\nc\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt of bottom sediments vs. depth.\n\n6.4 Calcareous oozes are abundant down to about 4000 m, but below that\nthey become much less abundant; there is very little carbonate below about 4500\nm. Oceanographers call the depth between 4000 and 4500 m where carbonate\nbecomes less abundant the carbonate compensation depth, or CCD; it's actually a\nnarrow zone rather than a single depth.\n6.5 The oceans are undersaturated with respect to CaCO3 below about 500 m\neverywhere; the reason carbonate is present down to thousands of meters is basi-\ncally a time-lag effect. Presumably the CCD has to do with what happens on the\nbottom, not what happens on the way down, because it doesn't take long for the\ntests to get to the bottom, but they sit there exposed to the water for a long time.\n6.6 The distribution of calcareous ooze is very irregular. Calcareous ooze is\npresent mainly on high areas in low latitudes, and it's present to greater depths\nwhere surface productivity is high. There's not much under areas of low\nproductivity, where nutrient concentrations in the surface waters are low, or at\nhigh latitudes, where surface waters are unfavorable.\n6.7 Forams are the major constituent of calcareous ooze, but not the only\none. Two other kinds of carbonate-secreting planktonic organisms also contribute\nto calcareous ooze:\n\n- a minor group of tiny gastropods, called pteropods and heteropods (mostly\nthe former); these are larger than forams but they secrete aragonite, so they\nare not found below about 3500 m;\n- two kinds of calcareous algae, called coccoliths and rhabdoliths (mostly\nthe former).\n\n6.8 In a few areas pteropods or coccoliths predominate in the ooze (then the\nsediment is called pteropod ooze or coccolith ooze), but usually they are just a\nminor admixture in foram ooze.

In the deep ocean it\ngrades laterally into the noncalcareous brown clay of the deepest ocean.\n\n7. PLATFORM CARBONATES\n\n7.1 Introduction\n\n7.1.1 In many places in the world today, carbonate sediments are\naccumulating on platforms along continental margins where siliciclastic deposits\nare absent. The two most important factors that control this accumulation are\n\n- lack of siliciclastic input, and\n- high biogenic carbonate productivity.\n\nUnfortunately the range of sedimentary environments represented by such areas is\nless extensive than must have prevailed at many times in the geologic past. That\nmakes it more difficult for carbonate sedimentologists to interpret ancient\ncarbonate rocks than it is for siliciclastic sedimentologists to interpret ancient\nsiliciclastic rocks--because they don't have a wide a range of modern sedimentary\nprocesses to use as a basis for interpreting the ancient rocks.\n7.1.2\nBecause the precipitation of carbonate is easiest in warm, shallow\nseawater, most carbonate production takes place on tropical\nplatforms within a fairly restricted range of shallow subtidal\nwater depths. These environments have come to be called,\npicturesquely, by carbonate sedimentologists the carbonate\nfactory. Although the most of the sediments that are produced in\nthe carbonate factory remain in the source area, some are\ntransported landward and some are transported basinward (Figure\n5-6). Thus, there are three zones of accumulation:\n\nC\na\nr\nb\no\nn\na\nt\ne\n\np\nr\no\nd\nuction on shallow tropical banks.\n\n- the subtidal open shelf and shelf margin, characterized by in-place\naccumulations of carbonate sands, carbonate muds, and reefs;\n- the shoreline, where sediments are transported from the open shelf onto\nbeaches and tidal flats; and\n- the slope and basin, where shelf-edge sediments are transported seaward,\noften by mass movements, and redeposited at depth.\n\n7.1.3 The shallow-water carbonate factory is very sensitive to sea-level\nchange. At various times in Earth history, sea level has fluctuated, on time scales\nof tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, and with magnitudes\nranging from meters to hundreds of meters. Most of the major carbonate-secreting\norganisms flourish when the water is shallow. If sea-level rise is slow, and the\nconcomitant increase in water depth is slow, the carbonate factory can keep up\nproduction; this is called keep-up mode. But if sea level increases fast enough,\nand water depth thereby increases fast enough, the carbonate factory has a strong\ntendency to shut down. This is called give-up mode.\n\n7.2 Regional Geometry\n\n7.2.1 The term platform carbonate is in common use for all accumulations\nof carbonate sediments in tectonically stable shallow-water environments. This\nincludes reefs, but I'll deal with them later. Because in areas of high productivity\ncarbonate sedimentation can be so rapid, carbonates tend to mold their own\nenvironment, even on the scale of entire shelves. So the regional bathymetry of\ncarbonate areas tends to be more varied than that of siliciclastic shelves, which\nare more familiar to most geologists. Below is an outline of the regional geometry\nof shallow-water carbonate bodies. Refer to Figures 5-7, 5-8, 5-9, and 5-10.\n\nD\ni\na\ng\nr\na\nm\n\no\nf\n\na\n\nr\namp carbonate environment.\n\nC\nr\no\ns\ns\n-\ns\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n\ns\nh\nowing facies of the Rocknest Platform.\n\nC\nr\no\ns\ns\n-\ns\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\nshowing facies of the Monteville Ramp.\n\n7.2.2 Carbonate ramps are major carbonate bodies built far outward from\nland to have gentle regi onal sea-floor slopes. Carbonate shelves are large flat-\ntopped carbonate bodies extending seaward from land areas. Ramps tend to\nevolve into platforms where carbonate productivity is high. Isolated platforms\n(or offshore carbonate banks) are large carbonate accumulations built up over\nlocal high areas offshore of continental land areas; they typically develop\napproximately flat tops and steep margins. Carbonate workers use the term shelf a\nlittle differently from others to be the flat upper surface of carbonate platforms or\nbanks. Carbonate buildups are smaller-scale or more local carbonate bodies\nshowing topographic relief; they are commonly present at shelf margins, but they\nare formed in other places as well. They usually result from the rapid growth of a\ncommunity of calcareous organisms and include the well-known group of coral\nreefs.\n\n7.3 The Bahamas\n\n7.3.1 Few places in the world today are very representative of the vast areas\nof shelf carbonate deposition at various times in the geologic past. Some of the\ncarbonate-producing regions are compared in Figure 5-11. An excellent place to\nstudy shelf carbonates today is on the Bahama Banks. The Bahamas are an\nextensive and outstanding example of warm, shallow, extensive carbonate-\ndepositing seas. The following is a brief account of the Bahama Banks.\n\nC\no\nm\np\na\nr\ni\ns\no\nn\n\nt\na\nb\nl\ne\n\no\nf\n\nm\no\nd\nern carbonate environment.\n\n7.3.2 The Bahama Islands are located on several submerged shallow\ncarbonate platforms that lie just off the North American continental shelf. The\nbanks cover 60,000 square miles, but the land area of the islands is only about\n4400 square miles. Water depths over most of the banks are less than ten meters!\nThere are several large islands and thousands of very small islands called cays.\nThe exposed land surface is very pure Pleistocene limestone with little soil\ndevelopment. In places elevations are over a hundred meters; these are fossil\nsubaerial dune ridges of oolitic sediment. Keep in mind that the entire surface\narea of the banks was exposed during the low stands of sea level during the\nPleistocene.\n\n7.3.3 The largest of the Bahama Banks, Great Bahama Bank, is split by two\ntroughs, Tongue of the Ocean and Exuma Sound, which extend down to deep\nocean depths, and each of the banks is separated from its neighbors by deep-water\nchannels. The shelf margins are well defined. The upper few hundred meters of\nthe slope is very steep, greater than the angle of repose; this is probably controlled\nby reef development in the past.\n\n7.3.4 The Bahamas lie in the belt of northeast trade winds. This governs the\nposition of islands on the windward margins of the platforms. Hurricanes are\ncommon, and they do important geological work. Throughgoing currents are\nwarmed as they pass over the banks, leading to supersaturation with respect to\ncalcium carbonate.\n\n7.3.5 Bahama reefs play a minor part in the carbonate sediment picture\ntoday, presumably because of the Pleistocene history of fluctuating sea level. But\ndeep borings show that they were much more important in the past. Reef\nconstruction is most important along the outer edges of the banks facing deep\nocean water, and they are much better developed on the windward sides than on\nthe leeward sides.\n\n7.3.6 Great deposits of pure calcium carbonate sand and mud are forming\nand accumulating on the banks. With stable sea level, the carbonate sediment is\ntransported to deep water as fast as it is produced, but slow crustal subsidence has\ncaused about 5 km of carbonate sediment to have been deposited since at least the\nearly Cretaceous, so the banks date from not long after the opening of the\nAtlantic.\n\n7.3.7 All of the various kinds of shelf-carbonate constituents described in the\nnext section are found on the Bahama Banks, most of them in abundance. Areas\nof ooids and of aragonite muds in particular are shown on the sketch map in\nFigure 5-12.\n\nM\na\np\n\no\nf\n\nt\nh\ne\n\nB\na\nh\na\nm\na Banks.\n\n7.4 Constituents\n\n7.4.1 A great variety of sedimentary carbonate particles are produced in\ncarbonate depositional environments. Here's a summary. I'll leave the broader\npatterns of depositional facies aside for now.\n\nS keletal Grains\nMany kinds of marine invertebrates precipitate calcium carbonate to form\ntheir skeletons. There is an enormous range in size, shape, internal structure, and\ncomposition. Crystal size within the skeletal material ranges from microscopic to\nlarge single crystals. Some is aragonite, and some is calcite; the calcite itself\nranges from magnesium-free to as much as 25% Mg (in the case of red algae).\nGrain shape depends on the skeletal geometry of the particular species, and, in the\ncase of colonial organisms, on the style of colonial development as well. In the\nwords of Dunham (1962), \"Carbonate grains are shaped more like twigs or potato\nchips than marbles\". Some of this skeletal material is buried in place; some is\ntransported, and can undergo various degrees of breakage and wear. I won't even\nattempt to illustrate the enormous range of geometry and structure of skeletal\ngrains; you will be seeing many in both hand specimen and thin section.\n\nO oids\nOoids are nearly spherical grains consisting of a grain of calcareous or\nnoncalcareous material serving as a nucleus around which successive layers or\nshells of calcium carbonate are precipitated or accreted while the particle is moved\nin flowing water that is supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate Figure 5-\n13: (left): Tucker, M., 1991, Sedimentary Petrology; An Introduction to the\nOrigin of Sedimentary Rocks: Blackwell, 260 p. (Figure 4.2, p. 110). (right):\nWilliams, H., Turner, F.J., and Gilbert, C.M., 1982, Petrography; An Introduction\nto the Study of Rocks in Thin Section: W.H., Freeman, 626 p. (Figure 14-8, p.\n385). Size ranges mostly from a fraction of a millimeter to about 2 mm--\nalthough, especially in the Neoproterozoic, they can be on a centimeter scale. If\nthe coating is thin relative to the size of the nucleus, the ooids are called\nsuperficial ooids or coated grains. Commonly there are two kinds of concentric\nspherical shells in the ooid structure: tangentially oriented aragonite needles, and\nnon-oriented cryptocrystalline aragonite. Ooids tend to contain organic matter in\nthe form of algal mucilaginous matter; this is seen as dark brown areas in thin\nsection. Ooids can also show radial magnesian calcite. This seems to result from\npurely inorganic precipitation. Ooids are common in the ancient and are known\nbut not common in modern carbonate sediments. The processes of ooid growth\nare still a subject of discussion.\n\nP ellets\nPellets are rounded grains of very fine-grained aragonite and calcite, a few\ntenths of a millimeter to about a millimeter in size. They are usually elliptical or\novoid in shape, but they may be broken to form beehive-shaped grains. Some are\nclearly fecal pellets excreted by such organisms as worms, gastropods, mollusks,\nand crustaceans. These are soft and friable at first, but they soon become well\ncemented. Other pellets seem to be formed by cementation and rounding of\nfriable irregular aggregates of aragonite silt. Because it is usually difficult or\nimpossible to distinguish among the various possible processes that form such\nobjects, the term peloid is in common use.\n\nI ntraclasts\nIntraclasts are fragments of carbonate sediment, usually fine-grained, that\nwas deposited and then later ripped up by strong currents to be redeposited with\nother carbonate sediment. The derivation of the word implies that the ripping up\ntook place within the environment of carbonate deposition, geologically soon after\nthe depositional of the sediment; don't confuse these with carbonate rock\nfragments in a largely siliciclastic conglomerate. The stage of cementation varies\nconsiderably. Commonly the intraclasts are tabular, reflecting breakage of semi-\nconsolidated sediment along stratification planes.\n\nC arbonate Mud\nCarbonate mud consisting mostly of needle-shaped aragonite crystals is\ncommon in areas with weak currents. Some of this carbonate mud is produced by\nabrasion of larger grains, but most seems to be precipitated directly from seawater.\nThe nature of this precipitation has been controversial: is it purely inorganic, or is\nit caused by algae? (You can imagine precipitation of aragonite next to the bodies\nof photosynthesizing algae, because the CO2 content of the water right next to\ntheir bodies is decreased, which favors carbonate precipitation.) The answer\nseems to be that both processes operate, but that algal precipitation is generally\nmuch more important than inorganic precipitation.\n\n8. REEFS\n\n8.1 Introduction\n\n8.1.1 A reef, rising above the sea floor, is an entity of its own making--a\nsedimentary system within itself. The numerous, large calcium-carbonate-\nsecreting organisms stand upon the remains of their ancestors and are surrounded\nand often buried by the skeletal remains of the many small organisms that once\nlived on, beneath, and between them (Figure 5-14).\n\nA\nr\nr\na\nn\ng\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\nof carbonate-secreting organisms on a reef.\n\n8.1.2 At present, far more shallow-water carbonate sediment is produced in,\nor in connection with, reefs than by any other means. Judging from the presence\nof reefs in the stratigraphic record, reefs have been important sites of carbonate\nsedimentation from the Archean. Throughout geologic history, they have\n\nexperienced various periods of importance and decline in terms of their absolute\nabundance (Figure 5-15). Furthermore, as organisms have evolved through time\nthe record of this is reflected in the history of reefs that have been dominated by\ndifferent communities at different times. However, in most cases, these organisms\nhave had very similar functional morphologies.\nA\nb\nu\nn\nd\na\nn\nc\ne\n\no\nf\n\nr\ne\ne\nf\ns\n\nt\nhrough geologic time.\n\n8.2 Terminology\n\n8.2.1 In the most common sedimentological usage, the term reef is used for\na marine structure built by organisms and with a framework strong enough to\nwithstand attack by waves. But the usage is confused; some use the term for all\nkinds of carbonate buildups, the above kind being just one of many possibilities.\nAnd the nonscientific meaning of the term reef is just a shoal of any kind on which\na ship can go aground. So it's best to preface the term with a modifier: organic-\n\nframework reef is probably the best. And there are several kinds of such reefs,\ndepending upon geographic setting.\n\n8.3 General Stuff\n\n8.3.1 Reefs are produced by growth of colonial carbonate-secreting\norganisms. But there's more to it than that. Marine life is abundant in warm\nshallow seas, but generally it has to adapt itself to the physical environment. But\nunder certain conditions, certain kinds of organisms can create their own\nenvironment by building major structures that alter the local marine environment\nfundamentally.\n8.3.2 Reefs need the strong waves and currents that act upon them: without\nthe strong water movements to clean them now and then of loose sediment and to\nprovide them with nutrients from the open sea, reefs would not develop in the first\nplace. The geological significance of this is that fragmentation by the destructive\nforces of storms is a natural concomitant of reef growth.\n8.3.3 Reefs have been of special interest to petroleum geologists because\nreef rocks in the stratigraphic record have often ended up being petroleum\nreservoir rocks: they tend to have high porosity, and they usually become encased\nin finer and much less permeable sediment, so they make good stratigraphic traps.\n8.3.4 You probably think of reefs as being formed by corals; to many, the\nterm \"reef\" is synonymous with \"coral reef\". Corals are indeed the chief reef-\nbuilding organisms today, but calcareous algae are major contributors, and in the\npast algae, bryozoans, and archeocyathids were at times the major reef builders.\nIt's better to think in terms of organic reefs than of coral reefs.\n8.3.5 The coral polyp, the coelenterate that sits in and on a cup-shaped\ncalcareous skeleton, feeds by filtering plankton. The polyps of reef-forming corals\ncontain algae called zooxanthellae, mainly in the cells of the covering of the\npolyp. The polyps and the algae are symbiotic: the algae receive nutrients and\nCO2 from the polyp, and the polyp receives oxygen from the algae. The polyps\nfeed at night, and during the day they are partly closed to put the algae in the best\nposition for photosynthesis.\n8.3.6 Colonies of polyps develop by budding or fission. All of the polyps\nstay in contact with one another, so the colony is like a quasi-animal. The growth\nforms of coral colonies vary widely, even with the same genus: dome-shaped,\nmushroom-shaped, and branching in all sorts of ways.\n8.3.7 Important: not more than a few tens of percent of the reef volume is\nthe rigid coral framework. There are abundant tunnels and cavities in the\nframework that are partly filled with other calcareous biogenic sediment. Most\nreef sediment is produced by the post-mortem disintegration of organisms that are\nsegmented (crinoids, calcareous green algae) or non-segmented (bivalves,\n\nbrachiopods, foraminiferans) and that grow in the many nooks and crannies\nbetween the larger skeletal metazoans. The rest of the sediment is produced by the\nvarious taxa that erode the reef: boring organisms (bivalves, worms, sponges)\nproduce lime mud; rasping organisms that graze the surface of the reef (echinoids,\nfish) produce copious quantities of lime sand and silt.\n\n8.4 Controls on Reef Growth\n\n8.4.1 Reef growth is mainly a function of the factors that determine whether\nthe coral colonies can flourish and increase rapidly in volume:\n\nWater Temperature. Winter water temperatures are rarely below 18° C\nover reefs; corals don't grow in profusion until the temperature is 25-30° C.\nTemperatures above 30° C are above the optimum for coral growth, and\ntemperatures above about 35° C kill corals. But temperatures above about 30° C\nare rare in the open ocean, so the chief temperature factor is absence of cold\nwater. Reefs are rare outside the tropics, and they are more common in the\nwestern than in the eastern parts of all three major oceans, because of cold\nequatorward-flowing currents in the eastern parts.\nWater Depth. The depth to which reef-forming corals can thrive is a\nfunction of light penetration, because the symbiotic algae need light for photosyn-\nthesis. Therefore it's not depth alone that limits coral growth, but light\npenetration. In exceptionally clear water a few species of reef-forming corals can\nlive at 100 m, but for most the limit is 70-80 m. With the usual turbidity around\ncoral reefs, reef corals don't flourish deeper than 50 m, usually less. Probably the\ndepth at which the greatest volume of new coral sediment or rock is added per\nyear is only a few meters below mean sea level. There are deep-sea corals that are\nindependent of light, but these don't develop colonies and build reefs. The\ndistribution of reef building also relates to water depth; platy forms develop at\ngreater depths, massive and branching forms at shallower depths, and encrusting\nforms face the reef front.\nNutrients. The coral colony needs a steady supply of food. Plankton are\nmost abundant where nutrients in solution are carried in by currents from the open\nocean. Algae produce oxygen during the day, but corals need oxygen at night\ntoo, and that has to be transported in by currents as well. Currents are thus\nfavorable to reef growth.\nSalinity. More or less normal salinity is required for reef growth. Reef\ncorals live within the salinity range 27 to 40%. Reefs can be killed by great\nfloods of fresh water sweeping over them from land.\nFine Sediment. Fine sediment restricts penetration of light, and it also\nhampers growth when it settles on the colonies. Probably the effect of light is\nmore important than smothering, because corals can readily clean themselves off.\n\nAlso, corals need a suitable substrate on which to develop: coral colonies can't\ndevelop on a uniformly muddy floor.\n\n8.5 Kinds of reefs\n\nFringing Reefs: these grow directly against a rocky coast. Width varies up\nto a few hundred meters. See Figure 5-16.\n\nC\nr\no\ns\ns\n-\ns\ne\nc\ntion of a fringing reef.\n\nAtolls: ring-shaped reefs, unconnected with land. These presumably\ndeveloped as fringing reefs around oceanic islands that later subsided while reef\ngrowth kept pace with subsidence. See Figure 5-17.\n\nC\nr\no\ns\ns\n-\ns\ne\nc\ntion of an atoll.\n\nBarrier Reefs: these, the largest and most important, are reefs separated\nfrom the continental coast by a lagoon that is too deep for coral growth and up to a\nhundred kilometers wide, floored at least in part by siliciclastic sediment. (The\nGreat Barrier Reef of Australia, following the coast of Queensland for 1500 miles\nand as much as 150 miles offshore, is of this kind.) See Figure 5-18.\n\nC\nr\no\ns\ns\n-\ns\nection of a barrier reef.\n\n8.6 Morphology and Sedimentology\n\n8.6.1 Figure 5-19 shows a typical cross section through a reef, normal to the\nreef front.\n\nC\nr\no\ns\ns\n-\ns\nection through a reef.\n\nLagoon: The lagoon is the relatively protected and shallow area behind the\nreef. Smaller lagoons are floored entirely by finer carbonate sediment; lagoons\nbehind barrier reefs can have mostly siliciclastic sediment. Lagoons often have\nnumerous coral knolls, or isolated coral colonies, each a miniature reef itself.\nDepths in lagoons are seldom more than 50 m. There is usually a great variety of\n\nsediment types in lagoons: typical sediments are coral debris from the living reef,\nforaminiferal and algal sediment, skeletal fragments of larger invertebrates, and\naragonite mud in the deepest parts.\nReef Flat: Behind the growing reef front is a broad expanse of dead reef\nrock with a flat surface, partly or wholly emergent at low tide. There are patches\nof sand and coral rubble and scattered small coral colonies, as well as shallow\npools, irregular gullies, and potholes. Islands are common on the reef flat; these\ncould be built by storms or be left from a higher stand of sea level. Most of the\nmajor islands on reef flats today are a few meters above sea level and are\nundergoing erosion; they probably were formed by the higher stand of sea level\nduring times of milder climate within the last few thousand years.\nReef Front: The heart of the reef is the growing reef front, a narrow zone of\nflourishing coral colonies. Waves and storms beating against the coral colony\nkeep breaking material away, throwing it onto or over the reef flat or carrying it\ndown the outer reef slope. It's here that most of the reef growth takes place.\nOuter Slope: Often the reef descends almost vertically for a hundred meters,\nthen at slopes as much as 30° down to deep ocean depths. The reason for the\nsteepness of the slopes is that the coral colonies grow fastest in their uppermost\npart, tending to produce an overhang. The lower slopes are a jumble or talus of\njagged broken reef material.\n\n8.7 Bioherms and biostromes\n\n8.7.1 Whenever you see large carbonate skeletal deposits in the sedimentary\nrecord, you have to think about whether they were part of a reef, or, more\nspecifically, whether they formed a mass that stood up from the sea floor or\nwhether they had no relief but built up in thickness along with the surrounding sea\nfloor. See Figure 5-20.\nC\nr\no\ns\ns\n-\ns\ne\nc\ntion through a carbonate buildup.\n\n8.7.2 A bioherm is the general term for carbonate buildups, large or small,\nproduced either by in-place production of large numbers of individual organisms\nor by colonial framework building or encrustation, as in reefs. These structures\nhad substantial positive relief on the sea floor. They have low width-to-height\nratios (W:H < 30)\n8.7.3 A biostrome is the general term for blanketlike deposits of carbonate\nsediment produced by in-place organisms and surrounded by other sediment\ntypes. There are shell biostromes (beds of unsorted and nontransported skeletal\nremains that grew and died in place) and algal biostromes (soft, sticky mats of\nsediment-binding algae, which catch fine carbonate sediment and then grow\nupward through that sediment to reestablish the mat). They have larger width-to-\nheight ratios (W:H > 30).\n8.7.4 Finally, the general term in use for any carbonate body that develops in\nsuch a way as to stand above the surrounding seafloor is called a buildup. The\nessential feature of a buildup is that it has topographic relief above the seafloor.\n9. LIMESTONES\n\n9.1 Definition\n\n9.1.1 The official definition of a limestone is a sedimentary rock that\ncontains at least 50% carbonate minerals, of which at least 50% is a calcium\ncarbonate mineral. Most limestones you will deal with have far more carbonate\nmaterial than siliciclastic material: approximately equal mixtures are not as\ncommon as dominantly carbonate or dominantly siliciclastic--although\napproximately equal mixtures are not vanishingly uncommon.\n9.2 General Stuff\n\n9.2.1 Limestones are a highly varied group of rocks. All they have in\ncommon is their composition. Some are grown in place, as reefs, and others are\ndeposited as particles, analogous to shale, sandstone, and conglomerate. Many\ngeologists have thought of limestone as a \"wastebasket\" term, and have tried to get\nrid of it by coining new and more specific words for the various kinds--but they\nhave not been successful.\nThe keys to understanding most limestones are these:\n- Most carbonate sediments started out as accumulations of particles, large\nand small, analogous to siliciclastic gravel, sands, and muds. These particles are\nproduced locally in the carbonate environment, and they are deposited with or\nwithout subsequent transportation. So you can think about most carbonate rocks\nin terms of framework, matrix, and cement, just as with sandstones, but keep in\nmind that most if not all the material is just carbonate in composition.\n- Cementation of carbonate sediments is usually very early; little burial is\nneeded. So reduction of pore space is much more a matter of filling by carbonate\n\ncement than by deformation of framework grains. Cementation commonly occurs\nbefore compaction of sediments.\n- Carbonate rocks are much more susceptible to diagenesis, early and late,\nthan siliciclastic rocks. Diagenesis obliterates primary structures and textures in\ncarbonate rocks long before siliciclastic rocks. This is due to their greater\nsolubility in diagenetic pore fluids.\n9.3 Classification\n\n9.3.1 In the late 1950s, Folk revolutionized the classification of limestones\nby proposing that most limestones can be treated as particulate rocks involving\nframework, matrix, and cement just like siliciclastic rocks. Although the terms he\ncoined for the various classificatory categories are not widely used these days, his\nideas have been of great significance.\n9.3.2 Folk called the coarse clastic constituents allochems. These are the\nkinds described in an earlier section: intraclasts, skeletal grains, ooids, and\npellets. He used the term micrite for the carbonate mud (short for microcrystalline\ncalcite mud; something of a misnomer because it's now known that most of the\nmud is aragonite, not calcite) and spar for the sparry calcite cement. Figure 5-21\nshows where most limestones fall in a ternary composition diagram. Figure 5-22\nshows one version of Folk's classification, and Figure 5-23: Folk, R. L., 1959,\nPractical petrographic classification of limestone: American Association of\nPetroleum Geologists, Bulletin, v. 43, p. 1-38, Figure 4, and Figure 5-24: Folk,\nR.L., 1962, Spectral subdivision of limestone types, in Ham, W.E., ed.,\nClassification of Carbonate Rocks: American Association of Petroleum\nGeologists, Memoir 1, p. 62-84. are two of Folk's original figures, showing about\nthe same thing as above but in more detail.\nT\ne\nr\nn\na\nr\ny\n\nc\no\nm\nposition diagram.\n\nF\no\nl\nk\n'\ns\n\nc\nl\na\ns\ns\ni\nf\nication o\nf limestone\ns.\n\n9.3.3 In the early 1960s Dunham developed a simpler and broader\nclassification using Folk's concepts; the names are in very wide use today. Figure\n5-25 shows Dunham's original classification table, and a later modification by\nEmbry and Klovan.\n\nD\nu\nn\nh\na\nm\n'\ns\nclassification of limestones.\n\nFigure 5-22: Folk's classification of limestones\nFigure 5-25: Dunham's classification of limestones\n\nThe key terms here are grainstone, packstone, wackestone, and mudstone.\nGet used to trying to apply these names when you look at a limestone. They are\nby far the most common terms used by practicing sedimentary geologists to\ndescribe limestones. Dunham's term boundstone, also important to remember,\napplies to a carbonate rock, typically a reef rock, whose original constituents were\nbound together during deposition and subsequently remained mostly in position of\ngrowth. A few others, however, not covered by Dunham's classification, are also\ncommon: a rudstone is a carbonate rock composed of bioclasts or other carbonate\nfragments, over 2 mm in diameter, that are close-packed and in physical contact.\nRudstones are the coarse-grained equivalents of grainstones and packstones--\nterms that are customarily restricted to sand-size carbonate clasts. A floatstone is\na carbonate rock containing a small percentage of bioclasts or other carbonate\nfragments over 2 mm in size, that are widely spaced, embedded in (\"floating in\")\nfiner carbonate sediment. Floatstones are the coarse-grained equivalents of\nwackestones. A bindstone is a kind of boundstone that is composed of sheetlike\ncolonies that encrust large fossil fragments or finer carbonate sediment, forming a\nlayered mass that is partly in-place skeletal, like boundstone, and partly bioclastic,\nlike packstone or wackestone.\n9.4 Microbial Carbonates\n\n9.4.1 The foregoing material neglects a very important kind of carbonate\ndepositional environment and the limestones and dolostones deposited therein:\nmicrobial mats.\n9.4.2 Since far back in the Precambrian, certain kinds of microbes (mainly\nfilamentous and coccoid cyanobacteria) have developed extensive mats in very\nshallow marine environments, ranging from very shallow subtidal up through\nintertidal. These mats present a dense network of growing filaments exposed to\nthe surface. Fine carbonate sediment (aragonite needles, or dolomite crystals to\nwhich the aragonite has been changed within the sedimentary environment) is now\nand then washed onto the mat and adheres to the sticky surface. The filaments\nthen grow upward among the sediment particles to reestablish the mat. The result\nis a laminated fine carbonate deposit. In some cases, the microbes cause\nprecipitation of carbonate directly on the surface, which accretes upward over\ntime.\n9.4.3 Depending upon environmental conditions that are still not well\nunderstood, the surface geometry of the microbial mat can either be planar or\nnearly so (these deposits are called microbial laminites) or take on a variety\ncomplicated geometries involving heads or domes of various shapes. These\nstructures are called stromatolites. Lamination in these stromatolites is\ncharacteristically convex upward, although there are some striking exceptions to\nthis. At the margins of the stromatolites the laminae dip at angles greater than the\nangle of repose, which is a tip-off for the cohesive or precipitated nature of the\ndeposition. In some cases the laminae end abruptly at the margins of the\n\nstromatolites. It was originally thought that stromatolites could be treated as\nactual organisms, and were given names like Cryptozoon, Anabaria, and\nTungussia, based on variations in their form and lamination fabrics. Although such\nnames are still used, it is recognized that the range of morphologies and lamination\nfabrics is due more to environmental factors than to biologic factors. Some\nstromatolites have poor lamination and a clotted texture; these are called\nthrombolites. Collectively, microbial laminates and stromatolites are termed\nmicrobialites (pronounced mike-ROW-bee-al-ites, not mike-row-BUY-al-ites!).\n9.4.4 In slightly different environments, especially with strong and regular\ncurrents, microbes bind or precipitate fine carbonate sediment around small\nspheroids that roll around while accreting concentrically. These spheroids are\ncalled oncolites (also called oncoids or microbial accretionary grains. They are\nanalogous to ooids, but they are different in origin, and usually they are larger.\nThey are usually from a few millimeters to more than a centimeter in size. When\nlarger, up to ten centimeters, they are called microbial biscuits.\n9.4.5 Telling microbial laminites from non-microbial laminites in thinly\nlaminated carbonates is a tricky business. Microbial laminites tend to show less\nregular lamination, and they sometimes show a characteristic structure known as\nfenestrae: little irregular cavities elongated parallel to bedding, filled with\ncarbonate cement or sometimes even geopetal fine clastic sediment. These\ncavities seem to have developed during gas production in response to\nphotosynthesis or respiration by the microbial community, or during occasional\ndrying and shrinkage of the mat.\n\n10. STRUCTURES IN LIMESTONES\n10.1 Many limestones have bed configurations (ripples and dunes) and cross\nstratification much as in siliciclastic rocks. That should not surprise you,\ninasmuch as carbonate grainstones, especially, consist of particles that were\ntransported by water currents. Certain other structures, however, are specific to\nlimestones. Below are descriptions of two of these. (There are others that could\nbe added here as well.)\nhardgrounds: Hardgrounds are surfaces or horizons with synsedimentary\ncementation that develops at, or slightly below, the sediment surface. It's a feature\nthat develops underwater, on the seafloor. The surface is typically encrusted by\nsessile benthic organisms (that is, organisms that live attached to the seafloor).\nSpecies of various phyla of marine invertebrates have that mode of life. The\nsediment lying immediately below such surfaces also tend to be bored by\norganisms that make tunnels into the sediment. The burrows are manifested by\nslight differences in the nature of the sediment that fills the burrows. Hardgrounds\nare significant because they record times when the rate of sedimentation was low,\nor zero. They often mark unconformities.\n\npaleokarst: You probably have heard of karst. Karst, a geomorphic feature,\nis a kind of topography that develops on limestone terranes by solution when the\nland surface in a region with abundant rainfall lies well above the groundwater\ntable. The surface manifestation of karst is a distinctive pattern of sharp hills and\nbowl-shaped depressions, that latter commonly floored by sinkholes. Below the\nsurface, karst is associated with networks of caves and caverns. In a limestone\nsuccession, karst (paleokarst, that is) can be recognized by the presence of a sharp,\nirregular surface that caps a zone of dissolution marked by solution breccias and\nirregular solutional passageways extending often far down into the underlying\nsuccession. The great significance of paleokarst is that it marks a time of\nemergence: a transition from a submarine depositional setting to a subaerial\nerosional setting.\n\n11. STEPS IN STUDYING CARBONATE ROCKS\n\n- Is it a limestone or dolostone?\n- Can you recognize depositional textures/structures?\n- Is the rock clastic, or is it a bound carbonate?\n- If bound, describe it on its merits.\n- If clastic, identify clasts, matrix, cement.\n- Think about giving it a Dunham name.\n- What about diagenesis?\n- What about sedimentary structures?"

CHERT\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\n1.1.1 Chert is the general term for very fine-grained and nonporous\nsedimentary rocks that consist mostly or entirely of silica, in the form of either\namorphous silica or microcrystalline quartz presumably derived from\nrecrystallization of amorphous silica. The non-scientific equivalent term is flint.\n1.1.2 Cherts are fairly easy to identify, even though you can't see the\nconstituents with your unaided eye, because of the way they fracture and the way\nthey look on fracture surfaces. Cherts are widespread (they are the last of the\nrocks we'll consider in this course that you are likely to see commonly), but their\ntotal contribution to the sedimentary record is probably not much more than a\npercent or two.\n1.1.3 The crystal size of quartz in recrystallized chert is usually in the range\n5-20 μm. Electron microscopy of fractured surfaces shows the quartz to be\npolyhedral, equant to elongate, and closely fitted to surrounding grains.\nCryptocrystalline geometries in the transition from amorphous silica to\nrecrystallized quartz are complex. Thin-section studies don't help much because\nthe quartz is too fine.\n1.1.4 Chert comes in two distinct varieties, nodular chert and bedded chert,\nwhose sedimentological occurrence is rather different. The problems with chert\ncome in its origin; it's another one of those rocks whose origin we have a hard\ntime observing directly. The relative importance of nodular chert and bedded\nchert has changed through geologic time: bedded chert is much more common in\nthe Precambrian, and nodular chert is more common in the Phanerozoic.\n\n1.2 Terminology\n\n1.2.1 Here are a few terms for kinds of amorphous silica and chert:\n\namorphous silica: material composed of relatively pure SiO2 but with only very\nlocal crystallographic order. Amorphous silica includes various kinds of\nhydrated and dehydrated silica gels, silica glass, siliceous sinter formed in hot\nsprings, and (certainly of greatest geological importance) the skeletal materials\nof silica-secreting organisms (see below, under opal).\n\nopal (or opaline silica) is a solid form of amorphous silica with some included\nwater. It's abundant in young cherts, back into the Mesozoic. Its geological\noccurrence is by alteration of volcanic ash, precipitation from hot springs, and,\nby far most importantly, precipitation as skeletal material by certain silica-\nsecreting organisms (see a later section). Opal starts out as what is called\nopal-A, which shows only a very weak x-ray diffraction pattern, indicating that\nany crystallographic order is very local. With burial, during the initial stage of\ndiagenesis, opal-A is transformed into opal-CT, which shows a weak x-ray\ndiffraction pattern characteristic of cristobalite another silica mineral; see\nbelow). Upon further diagenesis, opal-CT is transformed into crystalline\nquartz, resulting in chart that consists of an equant mosaic of microquartz\ncrystals. By that stage, most or all of the fossil evidence of origin is\nobliterated.\nchalcedony is a very finely crystalline form of silica consisting of radiating\nneedles or fibers, often spherulitic, of quartz. There's probably amorphous\nsilica in among the needles, and a variable water content. This stuff is\nmetastable with respect to ordinarily crystalline quartz, but it hangs around a\nlong time; it's found even in Paleozoic cherts.\nflint is the general-language equivalent of chert, usually applied to dark gray chert\nin nodules or as beds.\njasper: chert that's red because it contains hematite (often more than a few\npercent).\nporcelanite (also spelled porcellanite): a minutely porous form of chert with a\ndull appearance on the fresh surface.\n\n1.3 Silica Geochemistry\n\n1.3.1 The solubility of quartz in pure water is very small, several parts per\nmillion. Figure 6-1 shows a graph of quartz solubility as a function of pH. You\ncan see that the solubility of quartz is very low for pH values up to about 8\n(slightly alkaline) but then rises sharply with increasing pH. It's hard to measure,\nbut it can be calculated. Moreover, attainment of equilibrium is very slow. The\nsolubility of amorphous silica is an order of magnitude higher, and attainment of\nequilibrium is also slow, but much faster than for quartz; you can do it in the\nlaboratory. The dominant species of silica in solution in natural waters in the\nusual range of pH is silicic acid, H4SiO4, a weak acid.\n\n1.3.2 At room temperature and pressure, amorphous silica is metastable with\nrespect to quartz, but precipitates formed from supersaturated solutions are\nalways amorphous silica. This is because the building of the quartz crystal\nstructure at low temperatures takes a very long time. Solutions unsaturated with\nrespect to amorphous silica but supersaturated with respect to quartz remain stable\nfor many years if not longer. Clear crystalline quartz can't be precipitated in the\nlaboratory at the low temperatures and pressure of sedimentary environments.\nPresumably nature can do it because of the longer times involved.\n1.3.3 The concentrations of dissolved silica in rivers, streams, and lakes are\na few tens of parts per million. Concentrations are also in this range in\ngroundwater; the deeper the groundwater, the higher the silica concentration.\n1.3.4 What are the sources of silica in solution?\n\nweathering of silicate minerals: this is the ultimate source of most of the\nsilica in solution in the Earth's surface waters.\nthermal springs: the concentration of dissolved silica concentration is\nvery high but the absolute volume is small.\ndissolution of amorphous silica: this must be important in areas underlain\nby silica-containing sedimentary rocks, but it is certainly not as\nimportant overall as weathering of silicates\ndissolution of quartz: most natural fresh waters are in the pH range for\nwhich the solubility of quartz is very low, so dissolution of quartz is not\nan important source of silica in solution.\n\nFigure 6-1: The solubility of quartz and amorphous silica at 25°C\nTh\ne\nso\nlu\nbi\nli\nty\nof\nqu\nart\nz an\nd am\norph\no\nu\ns\n.\n\nHere's the bottom line: it's generally agreed that by far the greater part of\ndissolved silica comes from weathering of silicate minerals in source rocks.\n1.3.6 The concentration of dissolved silica in the oceans is surprisingly and\nextremely small: only a few tenths of a part per million. In the present oceans,\nthere's no possibility of precipitating silica inorganically. The reason for this very\nlow silica concentration in the oceans is that several kinds of organisms are very\neffective in extracting silica from sea water and fixing it in the form of opaline\nsilica in their skeletons. They do this out of equilibrium, by metabolic\nconcentration processes.\n\n1.4 Silica-Secreting Organisms\n\n1 .4.1 Introduction\n1.4.1.1 Several kinds of important marine organisms secrete amorphous\nsilica to form part or all of their skeletons: diatoms, radiolarians, and sponges.\nThese organisms play an important part, directly or indirectly, in the deposition of\nchert.\n\n1 .4.2 Diatoms\n1.4.2.1 Diatoms are unicellular photosynthesizing organisms, a kind of\nalgae, mostly from 20 to 200 μm in size. The cell wall of the organism is silicified\nwith opaline silica to form what's called a frustule, consisting of two valves that\noverlap one another like the lid of a shallow dish.\n1.4.2.2 Some diatoms are benthic (living on the sea floor), others (by far the\nmost important sedimentologically) are planktonic, living in the photic zone of the\noceans (the uppermost layer in the oceans, in which there is abundant sunlight), in\nless than 200 m water depth. They solve the problem of buoyancy by being fitted\nwith tiny fat droplets. They like cool water best, apparently because of greater\nnutrient supply, higher water density, and upwelling. At certain times of the year\ndiatom blooms produce concentrations of up to a billion organisms per cubic\nmeter.\n1.4.2.3 Diatoms first evolved in the Cretaceous and have been expanding in\nimportance since. A fairly high percentage of the total number of known diatom\nspecies are living today.\n1.4.2.4 Like foraminifera, diatoms rain onto the floor of the deep ocean over\nlarge areas. The resulting sediment is called diatom ooze. Fossil diatomaceous\ndeposits are called diatomite, or diatomaceous earth if friable. It's mined as a\nfiltration medium for water filters. Diagenesis of diatomite leads to diatomaceous\nchert, and if diagenesis is sufficiently intense, most or even all the evidence of the\noriginally diatomaceous nature of the rock is obliterated.\n\n1.4.2.5 Figure 6-2: Brasier, M.D., 1980, Microfossils: George Allen &\nUnwin, 193 p. (Figure 7.3, p. 42) shows what planktonic diatoms look like.\n\n1 .4.3 Radiolarians\n1.4.3.1 Radiolarians are planktonic protozoans with approximately spherical\nskeletons generally from 100 to 2000 μm in diameter. The protoplasm of the cell\nis divided into endoplasm and ectoplasm, separated by what's called a central\ncapsule. The ectoplasm has frothy gelatinous material in which are embedded\nswarms of symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, in the shallow-water species.\nRadiating outward from the central capsule through the ectoplasm are threadlike\npseudopods. The skeleton, situated within the cell, consists of radial and\ntangential elements of highly varied geometry: spicules, spines, bars, spheres,\nspindles, and cones. The composition of the skeletal material is either celestite,\nSrSO4 (a strontium sulfate mineral, which is unimportant geologically because the\ncelestite dissolves too fast), or opaline silica. Radiolarians have been around since\nat least the Cambrian.\n1.4.3.2 Radiolarian species live in a wide range of water depths. They like\nwarmer water. They trap and paralyze passing small plankton with their sticky\npseudopods. They maintain buoyancy by fat globules or gas-filled vacuoles.\n1.4.3.3 Like diatoms, radiolarians sink to the bottom and can accumulate to\nform radiolarian ooze if they are not dissolved before burial. Radiolarian ooze\ntends to be found at greater depths than calcareous ooze, and at low latitudes.\nFossil deposits of radiolarian ooze are called radiolarite, and chert containing\nradiolarians is called radiolarian chert. The effects of diagenesis are similar to\nthose on diatomaceous cherts.\n1.4.3.4 Figure 6-3: Brasier, M.D., 1980, Microfossils: George Allen &\nUnwin, 193 p. (Figure 12.1, p. 81, p. 48) shows what radiolarians look like.\n\n1 .4.4 Sponges\n1.4.4.1 Sponges are filter-feeding organisms that live attached to the bottom\nin shallow and deep marine environments. They are multicellular but are not\nconsidered to be true metazoans because they are not organized into tissues and\nthey have no nervous systems; in degree of organization they fall between\nprotozoans and metazoans.\n1.4.4.2 Here's how sponges work: they have an upright body shaped like a\nbag or vase with a hole at the top. The outer surface of the sponge has tiny holes\nleading inward to small chambers in the wall of the sponge that are lined with cells\nwith flagella that whirl continually to create a current flowing inward into the\ncentral cavity. Plankton sticks to the surface of these cells, which then ingest the\nmaterial. Sponges are thus low-pressure water pumps, which can pump a volume\nequal to their body volume in a minute.\n\n1.4.4.3 Sponges have skeletons composed of spongin (an insoluble and\nchemically inert protein, what you buy as a \"natural sponge\"), calcareous spicules,\nor siliceous spicules. It's the siliceous spicules that we're interested in here. They\ncan be straight, radiating, or irregular in shape, and they range in size from\nmicroscopic to quite large. Silica-secreting sponges have been around since the\nCambrian.\n1.4.4.4 Figure 6-4: (upper left) Clarkson, E.N.K., 1979, Invertebrate\nPalaeontology and Evolution: George Allen & Unwin, 323 p. (Figure 4.1, p. 49).\n(lower left) Clarkson, E.N.K., 1979, Invertebrate Palaeontology and Evolution:\nGeorge Allen & Unwin, 323 p. (Figure 4.4, p. 51) (right) Shrock, R.R., and\nTwenhofel, W.H., 1953, Principles of Invertebrate Paleontology: McGraw-Hill,\n816 p. (Figure 3-2, p. 76) shows what some sponge spicules look like.\n\n1.5 Nodular Chert\n\n1.5.1 Chert is widespread as nodules in limestone. Chert nodules are varied\nin shape, from more or less regular discoidal or egg-shaped bodies (that's the\ncommon shape for relatively small chert nodules) to highly irregular knobby and\nwarty bodies (the common shape of relatively large chert nodules). Their size\nranges from a few centimeters to a few tens of centimeters. They tend to be\nconcentrated along certain bedding planes. Where abundant, they often form a\ntwo-dimensionally or three-dimensionally interconnected network.\n1.5.2 Chert nodules are usually structureless, but some show faint traces of\nstratification coincident with that in the enclosing limestone. If the limestone is\nfossiliferous, the fossils in the chert can be either calcareous or silicified. And the\nfossils in the rest of the limestone may or may not be silicified themselves.\nSometimes the boundary between the nodule and the limestone passes right\nthrough fossils--suggesting that the nodules are a diagenetic feature, not a\nprimary feature.\n1.5.3 Although in the past some geologists believed that nodules form by\ndirect precipitation of silica gel on the ocean bottom, today the evidence for a\nreplacement origin is considered to be overwhelming:\n\n- irregular shape and interconnectedness of many nodules;\n- presence of irregular patches of limestone in nodules;\n- association of chert and silicified fossils in many limestones;\n- presence of replaced fossils in some nodules;\n- traces of bedding passing through nodules;\n- contacts of nodules passing through fossils.\n\n1.5.4 But the source of the silica is a problem. Did it come from within the\nbed or from somewhere else? The general feeling seems to be that, in most cases\nat least, the nodules can be explained by the presence of abundant biogenic\namorphous silica in the original sediment and then diagenetic reorganization. By\ndiagenetic reorganization is meant the process by which the disseminated bodies\nof opaline silica (sponge spicules, diatoms, radiolarians) are dissolved, whereupon\nthe silica in solution migrates to certain places in the sediment where it is\nreprecipitated in the form of opal-CT to form the nodules. This happens because\nthe pore fluids are undersaturated with respect to the original biogenic silica,\nwhich consists of opal-A, but are supersaturated with respect to opal-CT, which\nhas lower solubility than opal-A. Frustratingly (for me, at least), the literature on\nchert nodules never seems to provide the classic \"straight answer\" for what the\ncontrols are on the origin of the nodules: Why do they form where they do? Why\nis are the size and spacing the way they commonly are, rather than much smaller\nor much larger?\n1.5.5 Where the chert nodules form only a small part of the bulk volume of\nthe rock, a good case can be made that the silica that forms the nodules was\npresent in the sediment from the time of deposition. But how about when the\nchert forms the greater part of the rock? Then a stronger case could be made for\nintroduction of silica in solution after deposition, by circulating pore solutions.\n1.5.6 The chert in shallow marine limestones probably comes mostly from\nsponge spicules; that in deep marine cherts probably comes mostly from diatoms\nand radiolarians. In either case, the limestones that contain chert nodules are\ncommonly fine-grained wackestones and mudstones, because the remains of the\norganisms responsible for the silica were deposited in quiet-water carbonate\nenvironments conducive to the various silica-secreting organisms.\n\n1.6 Bedded Chert\n\n1.6.1 Chert is also found as continuous beds, from centimeters up to as much\nas a few meters thick, often, but not always, interbedded with shale. Bedded\ncherts are also often interbedded with turbidite sandstones and submarine\nvolcanics. Most such bedded cherts show abundant evidence of having been\ndeposited in the deep ocean.\n1.6.2 Two scenarios seem most attractive for explaining these cherts:\n\n- Open-ocean siliceous ooze is conveyor-belted to subduction margins\nand incorporated into a subduction melange;\n- Siliceous sediment is deposited near a subduction margin, interbedded\nwith subduction-zone volcanics and turbidites shed from the island arc,\nand incorporated into a subduction melange.\n\n1.6.3 Here we need to distinguish between Phanerozoic bedded cherts and\nPrecambrian bedded cherts.\n\n- Phanerozoic bedded cherts usually contain radiolarians, and they can be\nexplained by lithification and diagenesis of radiolarian-rich bottom sediments,\nalthough some may have been inorganically precipitated with radiolarians as a\nnonessential constituent.\n- Precambrian bedded cherts, on the other hand, show no convincing\nevidence of having started out as biogenic sediment, inasmuch as no silica-\nsecreting marine organisms are known from the Precambrian. (Some of the oldest\nand most exotic unicellular organisms are found preserved in Precambrian cherts,\ngoing way back into the Archean--but that does not mean that the cherts were\nformed biogenically from silica-secreting organisms). Most Precambrian cherts\nseem have been inorganically precipitated, although the processes involved are not\nentirely clear. The concentrations of dissolved silica in the Precambrian oceans,\nbefore the appearance of the silica-secreting organisms characteristic of the\nPhanerozoic, were probably in the range of tens of parts per million, almost an\norder of magnitude greater than today. It's common for such cherts to be\ninterbedded with chemically precipitated ironstones. Some of the very oldest\nsedimentary rocks, in greenstone terranes, are bedded cherts. Chert is\ncharacteristically interbedded, down to centimeter scale, with Precambrian iron\nformations.\n\n2. EVAPORITES\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\n2.1.1 Enormous volumes of sediment in the ancient sedimentary record are\ncomposed mainly or entirely of what are called evaporite minerals: minerals\nprecipitated from a saline solution that has been concentrated by evaporation.\nMost evaporites in the sedimentary record are marine evaporites (solutions derived\nfrom normal sea water by evaporation are said to be hypersaline), but there are\nalso nonmarine evaporites. There are a great many evaporite minerals, but only a\nfew are common. It's been estimated that something like one percent of\nPhanerozoic rocks are evaporites, and that a quarter to a third of the area of the\ncontinents is underlain by evaporite deposits in the subsurface, with thicknesses\nranging from a few meters to hundreds of meters. (Think \"salt mines\": there\nreally are such things.) Figure 6-5 shows areas of the conterminous United Sates\nthat are underlain by evaporites, and Figure 6-6 shows the location of the major\nevaporite deposits of the world.\n\nA\nr\ne\na\ns\n\no\nf\n\nt\nh\ne\n\nconterminous US.\n\nMajor evaporite deposits of the world.\n\nFigure 6-5: Areas of the conterminous US that are underlain by evaporite deposits\nFigure 6-6: Major evaporite deposits of the world\nMajor evaporite\ndeposits\nof the world.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n2.1.2 The Permian Period was the time of greatest evaporite deposition--\npresumably because much of the great supercontinent of Pangea lay in a low-\nlatitude belt of continental aridity in what we call, in the present time, the \"horse\nlatitudes\", where the troposphere experiences widespread subsidence in the\ndowngoing leg of the low-latitude Hadley cell of the general circulation of the\natmosphere.\n2.1.3 If you leave dolomite out of consideration (and some nearly primary\ndolomite must have been associated with hypersaline conditions), the three most\ncommon evaporite minerals are gypsum (a hydrated calcium sulfate mineral),\nanhydrite (an anhydrous calcium sulfate mineral), and halite, NaCl. But the only\nevaporite you as field geologists are likely to see is gypsum, because halite\ndissolves so readily in surface waters except in the most arid regions, and\nanhydrite, being the high-pressure anhydrous form of calcium sulfate, is mostly\nrestricted to depths greater than tens to hundreds of meters.\n2.1.4 Are you likely to see evaporites in outcrop? The answer is yes, for\ngypsum, but no, for halite (the two most voluminous evaporite deposits). Only in\nthe driest of climates--in the interior of Iran, for example--is rock salt exposed at\nthe Earth's surface.\n2.1.5 Evaporites are excellent indicators of paleoclimate: it takes a hot and\narid climate for major evaporite deposits to form. As you will see in a later\nchapter on economic sedimentology, evaporites can form seals for the\naccumulation of petroleum hydrocarbons in reservoir rocks. On a more prosaic\nnote, gypsum is the mineral that's used to make plaster and \"drywall\" (gypsum\nwallboard).\n2.1.6 Evaporite deposits are known from all the continents, with ages\nranging from Precambrian to Late Cenozoic (although Precambrian evaporites are\nscarce, either because they were not deposited or because they have been\ndissolved away during diagenesis through geologic time). Unfortunately,\nhowever, there are no modern evaporite depositional environments representative\nof the extensive areas of evaporite deposition that existed at various times and\nplaces in the geologic past. As with dolostones, this has led to great difficulties\nand a diversity of competing theories in interpreting the depositional environments\nof evaporites.\n\n2.2 Evaporite Minerals\n\n2.2.1 More than eighty naturally occurring evaporite minerals have been\nidentified. The intricate equilibrium relationships among these minerals have been\nthe subject of many studies over the years. But there are only about a dozen major\nevaporite minerals. Here's a list of the most important evaporite minerals:\n\nanhydrite CaSO4\ncalcite CaCO3\ncarnallite KMgCl3.6H2O)\ndolomite CaMg(CO3)2\ngypsum CaSO4.2H2O\nhalite NaCl\nkainite KMg(SO4)2.H2O\nkieserite Mg SO4.H2O\nlangbeinite K2Mg2(SO4)3\nmagnesite MgCO3\npolyhalite K2Ca2Mg(SO4)4.2H2O\nsylvite KCl\n\n2.2.2 But of the above minerals, only three are of paramount importance:\ngypsum, anhydrite, and halite.\n\nGypsum is a calcium sulfate mineral containing water of hydration. It's\nmonoclinic with one perfect cleavage, and usually white or colorless but\nsometimes gray or reddish. It's one of the softest of common minerals: you can\nscratch it with your fingernail. Its specific gravity is relatively low, 2.32.\nAlthough phase equilibria in the CaSO4-H2O system are far from clear, because\nof the difficulty of studying equilibrium precipitation and dissolution in the\nlaboratory, it seems clear that gypsum is the mineral that is stable at surface\nconditions and is virtually always the primary evaporite precipitation product.\nAnhydrite is an anhydrous calcium sulfate mineral. It's orthorhombic, has\none perfect cleavage and two other good cleavages, and is usually white to\ncolorless but sometimes gray. Its specific gravity is relatively high, 2.93. It is\nusually seen as massive granular aggregates rather as well formed crystals. It's\nstable at higher pressures and temperatures than is gypsum, so gypsum is\nconverted to anhydrite when the evaporite deposit is buried. The deepest reported\noccurrence of gypsum is about 1300 m.\nHalite is a cubic mineral with a perfect cubic cleavage. It's colorless when\npure but can be reddish from iron and various other colors as well. It's easy to\nidentify by its salty taste. It forms surface outcrops only in the most arid regions.\nIt's also a relatively low-density mineral: the specific gravity is 2.16.\n\n2.2.3 Not all evaporites are marine deposits. Nonmarine evaporites are\ncommon, although the volume of nonmarine evaporites is not nearly as great as\nthat of marine evaporites. Nonmarine evaporites are common in continental\nextensional basins. There is a great variety of nonmarine evaporite minerals.\n\n2.3 Chemistry of Evaporites\n\n2.3.1 You know, of course, that the oceans are salty. The salinity of sea\nwater is close to 35 parts per thousand, ppt (parts dissolved materials, by mass, per\nthousand parts of bulk sea water, by mass). Generally the salinity varies only\nslightly from place to place in the oceans, because of dilution and evaporation,\nalthough these slight differences are of extreme importance in controlling the\ncirculation and also the biology of the oceans. But in certain unusual situations,\nthe salinity can rise to much higher values, giving rise to evaporite precipitation.\n2.3.2 Almost all of the salt in sea water is accounted for by seven ions.\nHere's a table that lists these ions and their concentration in percent by weight.\nThese seven ions account for 99.7% by weight of all the dissolved salts in sea\nwater.\n\nCl-\n\nNa+\n\nSO4\n2-\n\n7.7\nMg2+\n\n3.7\nCa2+\n\n1.16\nK+\n\n1.10\nHCO3\n-\n0.41\n\nOf these, the last is controlled by the equilibrium between sea water and the CO2\nof the atmosphere. The dominant control on the rest is the dissolved-salt content\nof river runoff.\n2.3.3 Back in 1849 an Italian chemist named Usiglio made a classic, widely\ncited, but somewhat misleading experiment on evaporite deposition. He took a\nvolume of normal sea water and slowly evaporated it, and kept track of the\ncomposition and mass of precipitated salts as a function of extent of evaporation.\nHe found that when the water is reduced in volume to about 50% of the original\nvolume, a little iron oxide and some aragonite are precipitated, but precipitation of\nthe major evaporite minerals doesn't begin until the volume is reduced to about\n20%, when gypsum is precipitated. Then when the volume is reduced to about\n10%, halite begins to be precipitated. Further reduction in volume then leads to\nthe precipitation of various magnesium sulfates and chlorides, and finally to NaBr\nand KCl.\n2.3.4 In terms of volumes of precipitated salts, experiments like that of\nUsiglio show that if a column of sea water 1000 m thick is evaporated to dryness,\nthe precipitated salt deposit would be about 15 m thick. Of this, 0.5 m would be\ngypsum, 11.8 m would be halite, and the rest, 2.7 m, would be mainly salts of\npotassium and magnesium. But is this how most evaporite deposits are formed?\nNo; read on.\n\n2.4 Kinds of Evaporite Deposits\n\n2.4.1 Gypsum rock is usually finely granular but sometimes coarsely\ncrystalline. The mode of occurrence of gypsum is rather variable, because, as you\nwill see presently, diagenetic changes are usually far-reaching. Details of bedding\nare usually not well preserved. Gypsum is also common as nodules in a matrix of\ncarbonate or shale.\n2.4.2 Anhydrite rock is usually bedded, often with delicate lamination that's\ncontinuous for long distances. It's usually fine grained. You seldom see anhydrite\nin outcrop, however, for reasons that will become apparent soon.\n2.4.3 Rock salt is a massive, coarsely crystalline, and nonjointed rock. It\nsometimes shows bedding, especially by alternation of beds with greater or lesser\nconcentration of nonhalite impurities (gypsum, anhydrite, carbonates, and\nsiliciclastics).\n\n2.5 Diagenesis of Evaporites\n\n2.5.1 Changes in evaporites during burial and unroofing are usually\nsubstantial, for three reasons:\n\n- Evaporite minerals in general are very susceptible to solution and\nreprecipitation.\n- Gypsum is converted to anhydrite upon burial, and then the anhydrite is\nusually reconverted to gypsum as it makes it way to the surface again.\nWhen gypsum is replaced by anhydrite, there is a 38% loss in volume,\nbecause of the great difference in density between the two minerals. So\nthere's great extra compaction on the way down (which, incidentally, is\nconducive to nontectonic deformation, because if the pore water,\npreexisting and newly released, can't drain away fast enough, the\nreduction in solids volume tends to cause a liquefied state in which the\npore-water pressure can approach the lithostatic pressure). Conversely,\non the way up the anhydrite is reconverted to gypsum, provided that\nextra water is available. This expansion tends to cause even more local\ndeformation of the deposit. The change from anhydrite to gypsum on\nthe way up is usually delayed until the near-surface zone of influence of\nsurface groundwater is reached. This gypsum-anhydrite diagenetic\ncycle is shown in Figure 6-7.\n\nT\nh\ne\n\ng\ny\np\ns\nu\nm\n-\na\nn\nhydrite d\niage\nneti\nc\ncycle.\n\n- Halite tends to flow plastically on a large scale, because it's relatively\nweak and because its deposits have a substantially lower bulk density\nthan the \"normal\" rocks (carbonates and siliciclastics) with which it's\ninterstratified on a large scale. A horizontal layer of halite lying\nbetween layers of denser rock represents a gravitationally unstable\nsituation, and even slight preexisting nonplanarity of the layer leads to\nuprise of columns or domes of salt, called diapirs, typically on scales of\nseveral kilometers. Hence the term salt tectonics.\n\n2.6 Sedimentary Structures in Evaporites\n2.6.1 Do evaporites precipitate as bottom growths or as discrete mineral\nparticles? The former is demonstrable in some cases, but the widespread\nexistence of primary sedimentary structures, like lamination, cross stratification,\nripple marks, and graded bedding--just as in siliciclastic sediments and rocks--\ngives good evidence that the latter is the more important mode of deposition. It's\nclear that once evaporite crystals are precipitated they are susceptible to reworking\nand transportation before final deposition.\n2.6.2 Evaporites are highly susceptible to early and significant diagenesis,\nowing to the extreme solubility of the evaporite minerals. Most of the sedimentary\nstructures in evaporites are diagenetic. Various kinds of postdepositional folds\nand veins are common. Veins of gypsum cutting fine siliciclastic rocks (mudrocks\nand fine sandstones), both parallel and oblique to stratification, are common;\n\nFigure 6-7: The gypsum-anhydrite diagenetic cycle\n\npresumably the largely siliciclastic sediment contained an admixture of gypsum,\nwhich was remobilized upon shallow burial.\n2.6.3 A striking and common diagenetic structure in calcium sulfate\nevaporites is nodular anhydrite (Figure 6-8: Blatt, H., 1992, Sedimentary\nPetrology, Second Edition: W.H. Freeman, 514 p. (p. 327, Figure 10-7)), also\ncalled, picturesquely, chicken-wire anhydrite.\n\n2.7 Theories of Evaporite Deposition\n\n2.7.1 The great thickness of some evaporite deposits, as well as the common\ndominance of gypsum in the deposit, argue against simple evaporation of a body\nof sea water to dryness. One has to appeal to a continuous evaporation process\nwhereby a water body partially isolated from the open ocean is subjected to net\nevaporation (evaporation is greater than fresh-water runoff into the basin).\n2.7.2 If in such a continuous-evaporation basin there is no outflow of water,\nonly inflow, then all of the dissolved salts must be precipitated somehow,\nwhatever the ratio of sea-water inflow and fresh-water runoff. The common\ndominance of one or another evaporite mineral suggests, however, that some\npercentage of the concentrated brine flows out of the basin, somehow, during the\nevaporation process. Presumably the outflow would contain a disproportionate\nconcentration of the harder-to-precipitate salts. The outflow could be as an\noutgoing underflow of denser, more saline water beneath an inflowing surface\ncurrent of normal sea water (Figure 6-9A). Or it could be as a gravity-driven\ndiffuse flow through a permeable barrier (Figure 6-9B).\n\nTwo modes of inflow and outflow of water.\n\n2.7.3 If a greater percentage of the water is returned to the open ocean by\nreflux, then gypsum would be the dominant evaporite, whereas if a lesser\npercentage of the water is returned by reflux, then halite would be the dominant\nevaporite. In the least common situation, where an even smaller percentage of the\nbasin water is returned by reflux, the more exotic evaporites would be formed.\n2.7.4 Shallow ocean-margin continuous-evaporation basins of the kind\ndescribed above are a natural way of accounting for the thick and extensive\ndeposits of evaporites seen in the sedimentary record, but keep in mind that no\ngood examples are known from the modern, so it's all a matter of deduction rather\nthan of observation.\n2.7.5 Many evaporite deposits are relatively thin and intimately associated\nwith sediments of other compositions, and show excellent evidence of very\nshallow-water conditions, like desiccation cracks. An appealing way of\naccounting for such evaporites is to assume that they are sabkha deposits. A\nsabkha is a low-lying but supratidal surface along a coast with net evaporating\nconditions and little supply of siliciclastic sediment. (The adjective supratidal\nrefers to elevations just above the high-tide level.) Most of the time the sabkha\nsurface is emergent, but occasional storms cover the surface with sea water. That\nwater tends to seep down into the sabkha surface, and during later evaporation the\nwater rises again by capillary action, and the dissolved salt is precipitated as\nevaporite minerals. If the shoreline is prograding, a layer of evaporites some\nmeters thick may be deposited in that way."

INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Diagenesis is the term used for all of the changes that a sediment\nundergoes after deposition and before the transition to metamorphism. The\nmultifarious processes that come under the term diagenesis are chemical, physical,\nand biological. They include compaction, deformation, dissolution, cementation,\nauthigenesis, replacement, recrystallization, hydration, bacterial action, and\ndevelopment of concretions. (Soft-sediment deformation can be included in\ndiagenesis, but not hard-rock folding and faulting.) You can see from that\ncomplete, albeit not exhaustive, list that diagenesis involves a wide range of\ndisparate, but in many cases related, processes. If you like, you could think of\ndiagenesis as weird and terrible things that happen to sediments when they are\nburied.\n1.2 The two most important diagenetic processes are compaction (the topic\nof a later section), and lithification, the term used for the complex of processes--\nincluding compaction--by which a loose sediment is converted into a solid\nsedimentary rock. A variety of processes mentioned or described in later sections\nof this chapter contribute to the general process of lithification.\n1.3 The study of diagenesis continues to be an active field of research in\nsedimentary geology, in part because the variety and complexity of the processes\ninvolved has left many uncertainties, but also because of the importance of\ndiagenesis to petroleum geology, inasmuch as diagenesis is a significant control\non porosity and permeability of deeply buried sedimentary rocks, comprising the\nfine siliciclastic source beds, the coarser reservoir rocks, and the seals that cause\nthose reservoir rocks to be petroleum reservoirs. Diagenesis is an essential aspect,\nalthough quite different in processes and effects, of mudrocks, sandstones, and\ncarbonate rocks.\n1.4 This chapter concentrates on the most important diagenetic features and\nprocesses in mudrocks, sandstones, and carbonate rocks. You have already\nlearned some things about diagenesis of cherts and evaporites in the preceding\nchapter.\n\n2. COMPACTION\n\n2.1 Most sediments deposited under normal surface conditions have primary\nporosities of on the order of 30% to 70%. The lower values are more typical of\ncoarser, sandy sediments, and the higher initial porosities are more typical of finer-\ngrained, clay-rich sediments. Porosity in conglomerates and sandstones is largely\n\na matter of pore spaces among the framework grains, as modified by later\ncementation together with certain other diagenetic changes (more on those later).\nIn muds the initial porosity is commonly higher, owing largely to the tendency for\nclay-mineral particles to be surrounded by envelopes or cushions of tightly bound\nwater. Porosity in carbonate rocks varies widely, depending upon sediment type:\nthe porosity of well-sorted carbonate sands is in the same general range as that of\nthe corresponding siliciclastic sands, whereas reef carbonates commonly have\nmuch higher initial porosities.\n\nBACKGROUND: FLUID PRESSURE AND ROCK PRESSURE IN THE\nSUBSURFACE\n\n1. Provided that connected porosity exists between the material at some\ndepth and the surface, the fluid pressure in the pore spaces of a sediment or\nsedimentary rock at some depth below the surface is just the hydrostatic pressure.\nIt's the same as filling a tall drinking glass with loose sand and then filling it to the\ntop with water. The pressure at the base of the glass is the hydrostatic pressure--\nand is the same as if the sand were not there.\n2. In the sand-filled drinking glass, at any given horizontal level in the glass\nthe entire submerged weight of the sand above that level is borne by the grain-to-\ngrain contacts at that level. That's called the lithostatic pressure.\n3. Complications come where the pore spaces at a given depth are not freely\nconnected upward to the surface. In that case, the fluid pressure can exceed the\nhydrostatic pressure, by a variety of effects. Then the lithostatic pressure is less,\nbecause some of the weight of the overlying sediment is borne by the excess fluid\npressure.\n4. Fluid pressures greater than hydrostatic are characteristic of sedimentary\nbasins. In depositional settings where sedimentation is faster than compaction,\nfluid overpressure can develop. This is of great importance in both sediment\ndiagenesis and petroleum generation and migration.\n5. In SI units, the lithostatic pressure might be measured in kilograms per\nsquare meter. You could figure that out for any given depth by knowing the bulk\ndensity of the sediment or sedimentary rock. Lithostatic pressure within the Earth\nis usually quoted as kilobars. To convert from kilograms per square meter to bars,\nmultiply by 10-4.\n\n2.2 Most fine-grained sediments lose pore water soon after deposition by\nconsolidation, the process by which clay-rich mud is changed to mudstone. This\n\nis largely a consequence of compaction due to overburden pressure (that is, the\nweight, per unit area, of the overlying layer of later-deposited sediment). The\ncompaction of clay at shallow depths has been studied intensively by civil\nengineers because of building requirements. The effects of compaction at greater\ndepths is of interest to exploration geologists because to the need to understand\nporosity occlusion (by that term is meant the partial elimination of pore spaces)\nand its impact on the evolution of possible reservoir rocks.\n2.3 At all depths below the usually shallow position of the groundwater\ntable, the pore spaces of all sediments and sedimentary rocks are filled with water\n(or, more accurately, aqueous pore solutions, owing to the presence of solutes).\nUpon compaction, the expelled water has to go somewhere. The typical direction\nof flow is upward (not necessarily vertically upward; often updip).\n2.4 Generally, depth profiles of compacting sediments show an exponential\ndecay in porosity with depth. Fine-grained sediments often show a reduction of\nporosity from 70% to 20% within the first 2 km of burial (Figure 7-1). Thereafter,\nporosity is lost at a much slower rate and can be approximated as a linear function\nof depth. In contrast, curves of sandstone porosity during burial show an approxi-\nmately linear porosity loss throughout their entire history of burial (Figure 7-2).\nThe extreme compaction of fine-grained siliciclastic rocks is of great importance\nto petroleum geologists, because if those rocks contain mobile petroleum\nhydrocarbons, those fluids are expelled upward into overlying porous rocks, which\ncan then become petroleum reservoirs if they are capped by an appropriate seal.\n\nR\ne\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n\no\nf\n\nporo\nsity\nof\nfine\n-gra\nined\nsed\niments.\n\nFigure 7-1: Reduction of porosity of fine-grained sediments with burial\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nP\no\nr\no\ns\ni\nt\ny\n\nl\no\ns\ne\n\ndu\nri\nng\nb\nuri\nal of sandst\nones.\n\nFigure 7-2: Approximately linear porosity loss during burial of sandstones\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n2.5 Compaction commonly involves deformation, on scales ranging upward\nfrom individual grains.\n- In thin sections (Figure 7-3) one often sees bent mica flakes or squeezed\nand deformed rock fragments (which, in more advanced stages, leads to\npseudomatrix; see Chapter 4).\nDeformation of a muscovite flake.\n\n- Because of the difference in compaction between mudrock and sandstone,\na sandstone dike emplaced vertically upward or downward before much\ncompaction can become contorted because the mudrock undergoes so much more\ncompaction than the sandstone (Figure 7-4).\n\nD\ne\nf\no\nr\nm\na\nt\ni\no\nn of a vertical sandstone dike.\n\n3. PRESSURE SOLUTION\n\n3.1 Sandstones commonly show solution of grains at grain-to-grain contacts.\nThis is especially important for quartz framework grains. This process is termed\npressure solution. In its early stages, pressure solution involves only local areas\nat points of contact between adjacent grains. In later stages, a large percentage of\nthe surface areas of adjacent grains are welded together. Such boundaries are said\nto be sutured. Thereby, almost all of the porosity of the rock has been eliminated.\n3.2 How does pressure solution work? As with most minerals, the solubility\nof quartz increases slightly with pressure. Upon substantial burial, local grain-to-\ngrain pressures at grain contacts are enormous, not only because the weight of\noverlying rock is great but also because the surface areas of grain contacts is,\ninitially at least, small. That leads to slight dissolution of quartz at the grain\ncontacts. Consequently, the local concentration of silica in solution is slightly\ngreater in the immediate vicinity of the contacts, creating a gradient in silica\nconcentration away from the contacts. The surfaces of the quartz grains adjacent\nto the contacts, where pressures are much less, thus feel a slightly supersaturated\npose solution, leading to precipitation of quartz on those surfaces. The action of\nthis simultaneous dissolution and reprecipitation causes grain boundaries to\nbecome broader (Figure 7-5).\n\nS\nu\nt\nu\nr\ni\nn\ng\n\nof quartz grains.\n\n3.3 Pressure solution also occurs in carbonate sediments. In addition to\ngrain-to-grain suturing, pressure-solution seams commonly develop approximately\nparallel to bedding. The rock \"closes up\" along such surfaces, as the carbonate\nminerals (usually calcite) are dissolved and then removed from the vicinity by\nsolution flow. Presumably, the reason stylolites are usually parallel overall to\nbedding is that bedding surfaces are usually the paths of easiest flow of pore\nsolutions. Such surfaces of solution are called stylolites.\n3.4 One usually sees stylolites on rock faces at a large angle to stratification.\nThey look like a squiggly dark line, a bit like an electrocardiogram. (My all-time\nfavorite graffito, on the limestone wall of a toilet stall in a men's room at MIT,\nlabeled a stylolite \"my electrocardiogram\". The point, rightward, where the\nstylolite died out into non-dissolved rock, was labelled \"entered MIT\".)\n3.5 Of course, the section one is seeing on the rock face is just a section\nthrough a three-dimensional stylolite surface that extends through the volume of\nthe rock. It is uncommon to see an entire segment of the stylolite surface, but one\ncan do serial sectioning to figure out the geometry. In that way, it's seen that the\nstylolite surface comprises irregular pillar-like geometries pointing in both\ndirections away from the average position of the surface. The amplitudes of the\npillars are usually a few centimeters, but in extreme case they can be much larger.\n(Incidental note: the origin of the term comes stulos, the Greek word for \"pillar\".\nA stylite was one of a number of early Christian ascetics who lived unsheltered on\nthe tops of high pillars.)\n3.6 Stylolite surface are the sites of accumulation of insoluble residues\n(clays, iron oxides, and others) as the rock closes up. That's what makes the\nstylolites dark. In a very general way, one can estimate the volume of carbonate\nrock that has been removed by solution, by comparing the average concentration\n\non insoluble residues in the rock to the amount that has accumulated in the\nstylolite.\n\n3. PORE FLUIDS\n\n3.1 Pore-Fluid Composition\n\n3.1.1 Three varieties of pore solutions infill sediment pores: meteoric,\nconnate, and juvenile (Figure 7-6). Meteoric water originates from the\nprecipitation or rain and snow from the atmosphere. Connate water has evolved\nfrom the original water associated with deposition, and juvenile waters are of\nmagmatic origin.\n\nT\ny\np\ne\ns\n\no\nf\n\nw\na\nt\ne\nr that fi\nll sed\niment po\nres\n.\n\n3.1.2 Rain water is oxidizing and acidic. Acidity is acquired through nitrous\nacid formed during thunderstorms, carbonic acid from solution of carbon dioxide\nin the atmosphere, and sulfuric acid from volcanic gases. As rainwater seeps\nthrough soil horizons it also acquires humic acids from decaying organic matter.\nThus, when rain water enters a sedimentary unit it has considerable potential for\ncausing chemical reactions.\n3.1.3 Within the shallow sedimentary profile there is an uppermost zone, the\nvadose zone, in which the pores are open to the atmosphere (Figure 7-7).\n\nFigure 7-6: Types of water that fill sediment pores\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nZ\no\nn\ne\ns\n\no\nf\n\ns\nu\nb\nsurface water.\n\nFigure 7-7: Zones of subsurface water in a coastal environment\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nBelow the vadose zone is the phreatic zone, where pores are saturated with\nwater. The groundwater table separates the vadose zone from the phreatic zone.\nBodies of sediment or sedimentary rock that are sufficiently porous and permeable\nto hold large quantities of pore water are called aquifers. Sands, sandstones,\ngravels, conglomerates, and many carbonate rocks make good aquifers. Bodies of\nrock with low permeability, which inhibit flow of water, are called aquicludes.\nMuds and shales make good aquicludes.\n3.1.4 Connate water is defined most simply as the original (normally\nmarine) water with which a sediment was deposited. It is important to realize,\nhowever, that the chemical composition of these fluids may have changed\ndrastically because of various reactions between the sediment and original fluid\nthat take place immediately after deposition. A distinction can be made between\ncompactional water, which is evolved connate water moving through the\nsediments as a result of compaction, and thermobaric water, which is hot, highly\npressured water of deep basinal origin, normally formed by dehydration of clays.\n3.1.5 Connate waters are commonly much different from meteoric waters in\nterms of their temperature, salinity, and chemistry. The boundary between\nmeteoric and connate water is sometimes quite sharp, because fresh (meteoric)\nwater floats on more dense, chemical-laden connate water with its greater density\ndue to solutes.\n\n3.2 Pore-Fluid Flow\n\n3.2.1 As with other liquids and gases, as you learned in Chapter 2, pore fluids\nmove in response to pressure gradients. Meteoric waters flow because at any\npoint in the porous and permeable medium the fluid pressure varies from place to\nplace along an imaginary horizontal plane through the medium. This is called\nmeteoric flow (Figure 7-8). The essential cause of such horizontal pressure\ngradients is the non-horizontal slope of the groundwater table above. The slope of\nthe groundwater table tends to mimic the slope of the land surface, although the\ntopography on the groundwater table is subdued relative to the topography of the\nland surface. (The pattern of deep groundwater flow is not intuitive, and it would\ntake a lot more development of fluid dynamics here to account for it.)\n\nS\nu\nb\ns\nu\nr\nf\na\nc\ne flow of\npore\nfluids.\n\n3.1.2 Meteoric flow is most important at shallow depths and in basins that\nhave been uplifted above sea level. Where there are topographic highs along\nmarine basins, however, meteoric waters can displace connate fluids down to\nconsiderable depths. For example, fresh-water springs discharge at depths of\nseveral hundred meters beneath sea level in many coastal regions. Meteoric flow\nis important as a mechanism for generation of secondary porosity in both\nsandstones and carbonates in weathering zones that may be produced beneath\nunconformities.\n\nFigure 7-8: Subsurface flow of pore fluids in a coastal environment\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n3.1.3. Compactional flow (Figure 7-8) results when excess pore water is\nsqueezed out of the compacting sediment as the overburden pressure increases\nduring burial. However, as pore fluids move from compacting fine-grained\nsediments into more permeable coarser-grained sediments, hydrostatic pressures\nmay be maintained and no further fluid movement need occur. Consequently,\ncompactional flow is generally only a localized process and is not important in\nregional fluid movement.\n3.1.4 At greater burial depths, thermal gradients are sufficiently high as to\ninduce convection of fluids through permeable strata. Because such convective\nflow (Figure 7-8) can develop on the scale of entire basins, it is an extremely\nimportant process in diagenesis and emplacement of petroleum. Commonly,\nfluids leach minerals in one part of the basin and deposit them in others as thermal\ngradients or chemical regimes change.\n\n4. DIAGENESIS OF FINE-GRAINED SEDIMENTS\n\n4.1 The shallowest diagenetic zone is one of oxygenation. It is very thin or\nabsent in deposited fine-grained sediments deposited in water. In continental\nenvironments, like ephemeral lakes on playas, however, subaqueous mud\ndeposition may be followed by long periods of dehydration while muds remain\nabove the water table. In such situations organic matter may be oxidized and\nremoved. Iron may be precipitated as limonite and then become dehydrated to\nhematite, a red ferric oxide. (The term limonite is a general term for mixtures of\nhydrous ferric oxides, most commonly the mineral goethite but also others.) Often\nhematite develops during initial burial, forming deposits commonly referred to as\nred beds (also spelled redbeds, and pronounced \"RED beds\").\n4.2 In subaqueous environments, where the oxygenating zone may be\nabsent, sulfate-reducing bacteria are commonly active. In this situation sulfur may\nreact with ferrous iron to form the ferrous iron sulfide mineral pyrite:\n\nFe(OH)2 + 2S = FeS2 + H2O\n\nS ulfate ions may react with organic matter to form hydrogen sulfide:\nSO4\n2- + 2CH2O = 2HCO3\n- + H2S\n\n(where CH2O represents, in a simplified way, organic matter)\n\n4.3 Bacterial fermentation of organic matter also takes place during shallow\nburial. These reactions generate water, carbon dioxide, and biogenic methane.\nThis increases the pH of the pore fluids, which can lead to precipitation of\n\ncarbonates. Carbonate precipitation of this kind often occurs patchily as\nconcretions developed intermittently along bedding surfaces.\n4.4 Freshly deposited muds contain a variety of clay minerals--the most\nimportant of which are smectite, illite, kaolinite, and chlorite, in various\nproportions. These clay minerals undergo significant diagenetic changes as the\nsediment is buried. The caused of these changes is not pressure but temperature.\n(Keep in mind the usual geothermal gradient of 25-30° C per kilometer of burial.)\nSmectite is changed to illite, with an intermediate range of mixed-layer illite-\nsmectite. K+ ions are incorporated into the smectite structure, and interlayer\nwaster is lost. Smectite begins to disappear at temperatures as low as 70° C. At\nabout the same temperature, kaolinite is replaced by illite and chlorite. Such\nchanges develop upon burial to two to three kilometers. With incipient\nmetamorphism, the illite undergoes further increase in lattice ordering and crystal\nsize, to become what is called sericite, which is essentially fine-grained muscovite.\n\n5. DIAGENESIS OF VOLCANICLASTIC SEDIMENTS\n\n5.1 Fine-grained volcanic ash tends to undergo intense postdepositional\nalteration, producing bentonites. Bentonites are mixtures of smectite and\ndevitrified glass. Palagonite is produced during the alteration and rehydration of\nvolcanic glass.\n5.2 Volcaniclastic sands may have good porosity if they are deposited on\nbeaches or dunes. They lose porosity extremely quickly, though, because of their\nunstable mineralogy. During shallow burial they undergo hydration, leading to\nthe formation of authigenic carbonate, clays, and zeolite minerals (zeolites are a\nclass of hydrous aluminosilicate minerals). Thus, volcaniclastic rocks are\ngenerally very poor-quality aquifers or petroleum reservoirs.\n\n6. SANDSTONE DIAGENESIS\n\n6.1 Unlike in fine-grained sediments, in sandstones the effect of physical\ncompaction is subordinate to chemical cementation. Thus the loss of porosity with\ndepth is often not as predictable as it is in the case of finer-grained sediments. The\ndiagenetic history of a sandstone is controlled principally by the chemistry of the\npore fluids that have moved through its pore system. The main factors that\ndetermine mineral precipitation or solution are\n\n- the chemistry of the sediment, and\n- the composition, concentration, Eh, and pH of the pore fluids.\n\n6.2 Although many reactions occur during sandstone diagenesis, only a few\nare of major importance in sandstone cementation and porosity evolution: those\nthat control the precipitation of silica, carbonate, and clay minerals (Figure 7-9).\n\nThe solubility of calcite and silica are unaffected by Eh but are strongly affected--\nand in opposing ways--by pH. Silica solubility increases with pH, whereas\ncalcite solubility decreases with pH. Thus in acidic pore fluids, like meteoric\nwaters, calcite tends to dissolve and quartz overgrowths are precipitated, whereas\nin alkaline waters calcite cements precipitate and may even replace quartz. For\nmildly alkaline fluids (pH 7-10) both quartz and calcite cements may form.\n\nS\no\nl\nu\nb\ni\nl\ni\nt\ny\n\na\nn\nd\n\ns\nt\na\nbi\nli\nty.\n\nFigure 7-9: (A) Solubility of calcite and quartz vs. pH. (B) Stability of various diagenetic\nminerals in terms of pH and Eh\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n6.3 Clay minerals are similarly sensitive to pH. Kaolinite tends to form in\nacid pore waters, whereas illite develops in more alkaline conditions. Siderite,\nglauconite, and pyrite are all stable under reducing conditions.\n6.4 Quartz-rich sandstones (quartz arenites) are commonly cemented to\nvarious degrees by silica. Usually this is quartz; only rarely is it in the form of\nopaline silica (amorphous colloidal hydrated silica)--which occurs in younger\nrocks, often in high-temperature settings, as in some hot springs. Opal dehydrates\nwith age to microcrystalline quartz, termed chalcedony. Chalcedony is a common\nsilica cement in sandstones of various ages.\n6.5 One important mode of quartz cementation is pressure solution; see the\nearlier section in this chapter. The other important mode of quartz cementation is\nby the development of secondary overgrowths of quartz upon quartz framework\ngrains. The new, authigenic quartz is precipitated in crystallographic continuity\nwith the framework grains: the crystals are enlarged with no difference in\ncrystallographic orientation. The boundaries between the framework grains and\nthe overgrowths are commonly marked by thin, \"dusty-looking\" rims of very fine-\ngrained mineral material (mostly iron oxides and clay minerals) that was present in\nsmall nooks and crannies on the original grain surface. Of course, for overgrowths\nto form, such rims must be patchy and discontinuous. It's often, but not always,\neasy to see the dusty rims in thin section.\n6.6 In sandstones with lower percentages of quartz framework grains (lithic\narenites and feldspathic arenites), however, there is much less cementation by\nquartz. In such sandstones--and in many quartz arenites as well--the more\ncommon cementing material is calcite. In contrast to quartz cements, calcite\ncement tends to be patchy and irregular, suggesting replacement of earlier\nconstituents of the sediment. Much of this replaced material is probably quartz\nitself. The reason for this seems clear: the solubility of quartz increases with\ntemperature, whereas the solubility of calcite decreases with temperature. That\nmeans that, given the substantial geothermal gradient, at sufficient depths of burial\nquartz is dissolved and calcite is precipitated--provided, of course, that there is a\nsufficiently high concentration of calcium carbonate in the pore solutions passing\nthrough the rock.\n6.7 Both of the modes of cementation of a sandstone by quartz--pressure\nsuturing and secondary overgrowths--result in loss of porosity, but pressure\nsolution results in decrease of rock volume, whereas secondary overgrowths do\nnot. In the case of secondary overgrowths, silica must be supplied in solution\nfrom elsewhere; in the case of pressure solution, there is likely to be net loss of\nsilica, although suturing does not necessarily result in loss of silica.\n6.8 Here's a final but important point about cementation of sandstones by\neither quartz or calcite: the volumes of pore fluids that have to pass through the\nrock to do the cementing is extremely large--hundreds or even thousands relative\nto rock porosity--owing to the low concentrations of the respective solutes. This\n\nmeans strong flow (resulting from a combination of high permeability and strong\npressure gradients) or long times, or some combination of both.\n6.9 Sandstones may in some cases also be cemented by hematite. In this\ncase, iron is released during weathering of detrital iron-bearing minerals (e.g.,\npyroxene, amphibole, biotite) to form a coating of tan- to brown-colored hydrated\niron oxide (usually mainly goethite, although other hydrous ferric iron oxide\nminerals are involved as well). Following burial and temperature-induced aging,\nthe water is expelled and the transformation to hematite occurs.\n\n7. A NOTE ON LITHIFICATION OF SILICICLASTIC ROCKS\n\n7.1 You may be wondering at this point how sands and muds become\nlithified to sandstones and mudrocks. The crucial element in lithification is close\nand intimate contact between adjacent grains. This close contact can come about\nby compaction alone, provided that at least some of the constituents of the\nsediment are deformable. If you go into the laboratory and try to lithify a pure\nquartz sand by squeezing it with a piston (and arranging the squeezing so that\nexcess pore fluid can escape), you would fail: no matter how hard you squeeze,\nthe sand stays loose. If, however, you include some soft rock fragments, or\ninterstitial mud, you would end up with an at least partly lithified material: it\nwould not fall apart readily in your hands.\n7.2 To arrive at a more thoroughly lithified rock, you would need more than\njust compaction. You need cementation, whereby grain contacts are made more\nextensive by precipitation of authigenic mineral material around the original\ngrains of the sediment. You have seen that this can come about in a variety of\nways: pressure solution, deposition of cement, or recrystallization of the existing\nmineral constituents. Commonly, more than one of these processes is at work to\nlithify a sediment during burial.\n\n8. LIMESTONE DIAGENESIS\n\n8.1 Introduction\n\n8.1.1 Limestones formed on carbonate platforms are particularly susceptible\nto drastic, early diagenetic modification. Marine carbonate sediments consist of\nmetastable carbonate phases, like aragonite and magnesian calcite, which are\neasily dissolved and recrystallized by fresh meteoric waters or mixtures of\nmeteoric and marine waters, such as are encountered in surface and shallow\nsubsurface conditions. Because carbonate platforms can be maintained near sea\nlevel for extended periods, the possibility of fresh-water flushing of the platforms,\nwith attendant massive diagenesis, is significant.\n8.1.2 One of the major impacts of meteoric-water diagenesis is the basic\nrearrangement of calcium carbonate by dissolution of grains and the replacement\n\nof calcium carbonate as cement in pore spaces. There is a tendency for primary\nporosity in carbonate sequences to be destroyed early by cementation with\nsubsequent generation of secondary porosity during the dissolution phase. This in\nstrong contrast to quartz sandstones, which are almost unaffected during early\nburial because of the low solubility and stability of most of the grains under\nsurface and near-surface environments. Porosity in siliciclastic successions in the\nsubsurface, therefore, is generally primary, can be tied directly to variations in\ndepositional environments, and hence is highly predictable.\n8.1.3 Carbonates not extensively altered during early diagenesis are\nparticularly susceptible to chemical processes like grain-to-grain pressure solution\nand stylolitization during burial because of the relatively high solubility of calcium\ncarbonate.\n\n8.2 Dissolution\n\n8.2.1 Aragonite and magnesian calcite are stable phases in the marine\nenvironment, but they are very unstable in other environments (Figure 7-10). In\nfreshwater lakes, or in vadose or phreatic zones, pure calcite is the stable phase.\nDissolution of metastable phases may often be selective, and originally aragonitic\nparts of shells may be dissolved while magnesian calcites remain intact.\n\nD\ni\na\ng\ne\nn\ne\nt\ni\nc\n\nc\na\nr\nbonates in coastal environment.\nFigure 7-10: Diagenetic carbonates in coastal environments\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n8.3 Cementation\n\n8.3.1 Cementation by calcite cements commonly occurs in the deeper parts\nof freshwater aquifers in the phreatic zone. Saturation is achieved with respect to\ncalcite as a result of dissolution of more soluble aragonite and magnesian calcite\nin more updip locations, closer to the recharge area of the aquifer. As fluids move\nprogressively downdip, they dissolve more and more aragonite and magnesian\ncalcite until the fluid approaches saturation with respect to those phases. Because\nthe solubility of pure calcite is lower than that of Mg-calcite or aragonite,\nhowever, the fluid at that point is supersaturated with respect to calcite and\nprecipitates calcite rim cements. Rim cements (that is, those that encrust all\nexposed grain surfaces) are characteristic of cementation in the phreatic zone.\nRim cements generally have a blocky habit.\n8.3.2 Cementation by carbonate cements is not restricted to the fresh-water\nphreatic zone. In fact, it commonly occurs in pores spaces almost immediately\nafter sedimentation of particles while fluids are still marine in composition. This\nmode of cementation, termed early marine cementation, is the process whereby\nreefs are made hard as rocks.\n8.3.3 Marine cements may occur as magnesian calcite or aragonite drusy\ncements. Generally, the morphology of the crystals favors aragonite forming fine,\nfibrous fringes, whereas Mg calcite forms somewhat coarser, bladed fringes.\nThese are precipitated as drusy cements, although during precipitation in the upper\n(supratidal) parts of tidal flats, where exposure in the shallow vadose zone may\noccur, cements may have more of a microstalactitic fabric. (You know already\nwhat stalactites are; the adjective drusy applies, in a pore space, to a mineral\nsurface that is covered with small projecting crystals.) In this case, fine fringes\nmay hang downwards from the undersides of grains and form by precipitation\nfrom marine fluids, introduced during storms, that percolate down through the\nshallow vadose zone.\n8.4 Replacement\n\n8.4.1 Carbonate petrologists have long recognized that some carbonate\nparticles. like ooids or shells, or unstable marine cements that were originally\nsediments, are now different in both crystal size and mineralogy. This realization\nfollows from recognition of ghosts of the primary mineral, represented by\ninclusions, pseudomorphs, or reproduction of an original outline. (A\npseudomorph is a mineral whose outward crystal form is that of another mineral,\nowing to some process that changed the mineral composition without changing the\ncrystal geometry.) It is obvious in many cases that the original material could not\nsimply have been dissolved away and the new phase precipitated as cement. In\norder to preserve the evidence of the original material, the growth of the new\nmineral must have taken place simultaneously with the step-by-step dissolution of\nthe earlier material. This situation implies that the fluid exists as a thin film, so as\n\nto not generate void space, and to be delicately balanced in terms of composition\nso as not to dissolve faster than precipitation can proceed.\n8.4.2 This process of replacement is commonly called neomorphism.\nNeomorphism includes the diagenetic processes in which older crystals, whether\nabiotic or biogenic in origin, are consumed and in their place simultaneously\noccupied by new crystals of the same mineral or a polymorph. Thus, sparry\ncements can thus have two entirely different origins. (The adjective sparry is\nderived from the noun spar, a term that's applied, loosely, to any transparent light-\ncolored crystal.) In the first case dissolution and precipitation are sufficiently\nstaggered in time so as to have the cement precipitate in a relatively large void.\nThe sparry cement reflects this in the size and shape of crystals, with small crystals\nnucleating along the margins of the void space, and becoming increasingly large\nand blocky up to a maximum in the center of the void. In the case of neomorphic\nsparry cements, precipitation is intimately associated with dissolution, and\nsubsequent morphology reflects the sediment particle that was replaced and not\nthe void space. There is little variation in grain size except where it reflects\nprimary variations in grain size.\n\n9. DOLOSTONES\n\n9.1 Introduction\n\n9.1.1 By definition, dolostone is a carbonate rock in which more than 50%\nof the carbonate minerals is dolomite. Rocks with mixtures of calcite and\ndolomite are common (you can use the terms calcitic dolostone or dolomitic\nlimestone), but my own experience is that there's a bimodal distribution, with\nfairly pure dolostones and fairly pure limestones more common than mixtures.\n9.1.2 Warning on usage: the term dolomite is commonly used not only for\nthe mineral but also for the rock, even though technically the rock should be called\na dolostone.\n9.1.3 Dolostones are widespread and abundant in the sedimentary record,\nalthough not as abundant as limestones. It's interesting that the relative\nabundance of dolostone increases with age: there is almost none in the Cenozoic,\nand only a few percent in the Mesozoic, but the proportions are about 3:1\nlimestone to dolostone in the Paleozoic, and just the reverse, 1:3, in the\nPrecambrian. Why? It's not known for sure. Possibilities: deposition;\nreplacement; preservation. Probably a combination of the first two.\n\n- very fine-grained dolostones, characteristically thinly laminated, often with\nvarious primary depositional structures like desiccation cracks, but few\nfossils;\n- coarse crystalline dolostones with abundant evidence of replacement, and\ncommonly showing relicts or ghosts of primary features like stratification,\nooids, or fossils.\n\nThe usual assumption is that the first kind is nearly primary, forming soon after\ndeposition of the calcium carbonate sediment. The second kind is secondary,\nformed by replacement of calcite by dolomite in limestones well after\nsedimentation occurs, after the carbonate sediment has been lithified.\n9.2.2 In many carbonate rocks you can see good evidence of incomplete\ndolomitization: scattered rhombs of dolomite growing in a mass of calcite that\ncommonly shows primary sedimentary textures and structures. The dolomite is\nneomorphic after the calcite.\n9.2.3 Thorough dolomitization leads to a totally crystalline dolostone in\nwhich the dolomite forms an interlocking crystal mosaic. Such dolostones are\noften described as saccharoidal dolostone ox sucrosic dolostone.\n\n10.3 Relationships Between Limestone and Dolostone\n\n9.3.1 Here are some generalizations about the spatial relationships between\nlimestone and dolostone in stratigraphic sections, ranging from the small scale to\nthe large scale.\n\n- On the scale of individual beds, incomplete dolomitization is common.\nYou see \"mottled\" rock with a patchy distribution of dolomite. The dolomite\nareas are irregular in shape, and they may or may not be interconnected.\n- On the scale of successions of beds, you often see interbedding of\nlimestone and dolostone on a scale of millimeters to decimeters to meters (or at\nleast some beds show more thorough dolomitization than others).\n- On the scale of meters to whole formations, irregular dolomitization can\ncut primary features indiscriminately. This is often clearly related to joints and\nfaults, but sometimes its origin is obscure.\n- On the scale of entire stratigraphic sections (to produce what could be\ncalled stratigraphic associations of dolostone), it's found that dolostone tends to be\nnearshore and shallow-water, whereas limestone tends to be offshore and deeper-\nwater. There are many exceptions to this generalization, however.\n\n9.2 Kinds of Dolostone\n9.2.1 There are two broad groups of dolostone:\n\n9.4.1 The origin of dolostones was deeply mysterious until quite recently;\nit's been only in the last twenty years that sedimentologists have developed even a\npartial understanding of the nature of dolostones. This is largely because there are\nfew places in the world today where dolomite is being precipitated in anything\nlike a primary depositional environment. In fact, up until the 1960s NO places\nwere known!\n9.4.2 It's clear that dolomite crystals don't nucleate spontaneously from sea\nwater. Such nucleation is observed for aragonite in certain marine situations, but\nit's never been observed for dolomite. But sea water is oversaturated with respect\nto dolomite as well to calcite and aragonite (see the earlier chapter on limestones),\nand dolomite crystals are happy in sea water once they have formed. As noted in\nthe chapter on limestones, the lack of nucleation and growth of dolomite in sea\nwater is probably a matter of kinetics: it takes so long to build highly ordered\nstructure of dolomite that dolomite loses out to calcite or aragonite in the\ncompetition for Ca2+ ions.\n9.4.3 The general thinking is that the primary-looking dolostone we see is\nthe result of dolomitization of fine calcium carbonate mud (presumably aragonite)\nvery soon after precipitation, while the sediment is still at or close to the\ndepositional surface. Conversion to dolomite before the sediment is finally\ndeposited is suggested by the sometimes beautiful preservation of primary\ndepositional features in fine-grained dolostones. This has been observed in the\nfew modern settings where deposition of dolomitic sediment can be studied.\n9.4.4 The other matter that needs to be addressed is the process(es) for\npartial or total replacement of calcite or aragonite by dolomite in the deposit long\nafter deposition. In the case of late replacement along fractures, one has to appeal\nto dolomitizing solutions unrelated to the original deposition. But most secondary\ndolomite seems to have been formed while the deposit was still within the\ndepositional setting, although probably deeply buried. Two major theories have\nbeen proposed: seepage-reflux dolomitization and brackish-water dolomitization\n(also called Dorag dolomitization).\nSeepage Reflux (Figure 7-11): In a setting with restricted high-salinity\nwater associated with the depositional area, one can picture dense water with\nlowered Ca2+ content and heightened Mg2+ content (owing to extraction of the\nCa2+ by precipitation of calcite and/or aragonite) percolating downward and\noutward through the calcium carbonate sediment back to the open ocean. Water\nseeping through the body of a reef from the lagoon is the best example.\n\n9.4 The Origin of Dolostone\n\nD\no\nl\no\nm\ni\nt\ni\nz\nation\nby see\npage\nref\nlu\nx.\n\nBrackish-Water Dolomitization (Figure 7-12): It's known that mixtures of\nsea water and fresh water containing about 5% to 30% sea water are\nsupersaturated with respect to dolomite but unsaturated with respect to calcium\ncarbonate minerals. Brackish water percolating through an already-deposited\nsediment should therefore tend to dolomitize the sediment. This process has been\ninvoked to account for dolomitization of various dolomitic units, both recent and\nancient.\n\nD\no\nl\no\nm\ni\nt\ni\nz\na\ntion\nby perc\nol\nat\nio\nn of\nbrac\nkish water.\n\nFigure 7-12: Sketch of do1omitzation by percolation of brackish water\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure 7-11: Sketch of dolomitization by seepage reflux\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n9.5 Practical Things About Dolostone\n\n9.5.1 Dolostone doesn't fizz in the dilute HCl used for limestone\nidentification, but if it's powdered with a knife, then it will fizz. This is a fairly\nreliable field test, although you have to be careful, because small amounts of\ncalcium carbonate cement in a rock could produce about the same effect.\n9.5.2 Dolostones tend to weather in tan to buff colors, presumably because\nthere usually are small percentages of ferrous iron in the dolomite. Fairly pure\nlimestones, on the other hand, tend to weather gray.\n9.5.3 In arid to semiarid regions, the weathered-surface texture of limestones\nand dolostones are different. Limestone weathers by solution even in arid regions,\nand sloping bedrock surfaces show development of a network of fine solution rills.\nDolostone, on the other hand, weathers by granular disintegration, and presents a\ngranular-rough surface without solution rills.\n9.5.4 Dolostones are seldom very fossiliferous: nearly primary dolostones\nwere deposited in environments often hostile to macroorganisms, and replacement\ndolostone usually has its fossils partly or entirely obliterated. It's important to\nrecognize, however, that there are well documented examples of dolomitized but\nnonetheless richly fossiliferous carbonates."

Now it's time for you to deal with what\nsedimentary and volcanic rocks are like on a larger scale.\n1.2 This chapter deals with sedimentary and volcanic rocks on scales much\nlarger than hand specimens: outcrops, and large areas of the land surface that\ngeologists tend to call \"field areas\" (because they \"go out in the field\" and \"do\nfield work\" to study such rocks; you will be doing some of that yourself, on the\nfield trip.).\n1.3 The study of stratified rocks is called stratigraphy. It's the branch of\ngeology that deals with the description, correlation, and interpretation of\nstratified sediments and stratified rocks on and in the Earth. Inasmuch as by far\nthe greatest part of the uppermost zone of the earth's bedrock is sedimentary rock,\nstratigraphy is an important branch of Earth science.\n\n2. MORE ON STRATIFICATION\n\n2.1 You will soon see many examples of stratification in hand specimens,\nbut the best way to see stratification in all its beauty and complexity is to look at\noutcrops. We won't have a chance to do that until the field trip, later in the\nsemester, but I will be showing you some color slides of stratified outcrops in\nclass. Those pictures will be worth much more than the proverbial thousand\nwords in giving you an idea of what stratification is like. You'll see that strata\nrange in thickness from submillimeter scale to many meters--although you will\nsee that there is an upper limit: by the time you get to whole rock units, you' are\nno longer dealing with stratification, even though in a sense they are \"stratified\".\n2.2 How is stratification produced? That very fundamental question goes\nright to the heart of how and where sediments are deposited. There was some\nmaterial on that earlier in the course, but here are some reminders.\n2.3 In an approximate sort of way, processes of two different kinds produce\nstratification in sediments:\n\n- variations in slow and continuous depositional processes with time,\nbecause of slow changes in environmental conditions, and\n- brief and often catastrophic depositional events that punctuate slow\n\"background\" sedimentation. The latter tend to produce more striking,\nand usually thicker, stratification than the former.\n\n2.4 Here's a very skeletal survey of modern environments of deposition.\n(There will be whole chapter on depositional environments later.)\n\nmarine (ranging from shallow to deep; a wide variety of environments)\nfluvial (i.e., in rivers)\nlacustrine (i.e., in lakes)\nglacial (both directly beneath glaciers, and at and near the margins of\nglaciers)\neolian (i.e., by the wind)\n\n2.5 It should be easy for you to understand how sediments can be buried and\npreserved \"permanently\" in the ocean, but probably less easy for you to\nunderstand how sediments deposited on the continents (all of the other kinds of\nenvironments listed above) can be preserved, inasmuch as the continents are, in\nthe long run, being worn down by erosion. The answer lies in what's meant by\n\"temporary\" and \"permanent\". In the first place, by virtue of the workings of plate\ntectonics, the oceans don't actually afford a \"permanent\" resting places for\nsediments anyway. Moreover, in a great many situations on the continents, thick\nsuccessions of sediments can be deposited in areas that undergo substantial\nsubsidence and might escape reerosion for geologically long times.\n2.6 A few words about event beds and the events that deposit them seem in\norder here. The main kinds of events responsible for sediment beds are storms at\nsea, river floods, and sediment gravity flows in the ocean and in large lakes. The\nfirst two are easier to understand than the last.\n2.7 Turbidity currents are the most important kind of sediment gravity flow.\nHere's an instructive but messy home experiment on turbidity currents. You will\nneed access to a bathtub. Obtain a mixture of sediment ranging in size from mud\nto sand (a volume of sediment no bigger than the size of a shoebox will do), and a\nbig plastic rubbish barrel. Fill the barrel about half full of water, pour in the\nsediment, and stir it up well with a paddle to maintain a suspension. Now fill your\nbathtub, and pour the sediment-water mixture into the sloping \"back\" end of the\ntub (the end away from the faucets and drain). The suspension will flow down the\nslope of the bathtub and out onto the \"basin plain\" as a bottom-hugging density\nunderflow, with a well-defined head and a following body and tail with a roily,\nturbulent interface with the overlying clear water (Figure 8-1). The result is a bed\n\nof sediment deposited from the turbidity current as it moves. Such a bed, called a\nturbidite, tends to show normal grading: the particle size in the deposit is coarsest\nat the base and fines upward to the top of the layer. Turbidites of this kind are\nclassic examples of event beds. The sedimentary record is replete with turbidites,\neach deposited in a matter of minutes to hundreds of minutes, interbedded with\nmuds or shales that might have been deposited at rates as slow as a few\ncentimeters per thousand years!\n\nA\n\nt\nu\nr\nb\ni\ndity\ncur\nrent.\n\n2.8 Here are some other examples of events or processes that give rise to the\nstrata we see in the modern and ancient record of stratified rocks:\n\n- A sand bed deposited on the continental shelf by a gigantic storm\n- A gravel bed spread over a small area of the bed of a braided stream by\na flood\n- A thin lamina of clay deposited in the deep ocean, with slightly different\ncomposition and/or texture, caused by slight change in depositional\nconditions, that serves to distinguish it from underlying and overlying\nstrata\n- A basalt flow spread over a land surface by a volcano\n- An ash bed deposited over a wide area by an explosive volcanic\neruption\n\n2.9 Incidentally, how do we know about such depositional processes in the\nfirst place? That might seem like a trivial question, but in fact it's a serious one.\nGeologists make a distinction between \"the modern\" (what is happening, and\nwhat we can observe, at present) and \"the ancient\" (what's recorded in the rock\n\nFigure 8-1: A turbidity current\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nrecord of the earth). It's ironic that we can actually see the deposit better in the\nancient than in the modern, because of the great difficulty of sampling the\nsediment after the event in the modern, to say nothing of the difficulty of even\nwatching the event happen (divers have a dangerous enough time without having\nto contend with powerful currents that would sweep them away). The deposits are\neasy to see in the ancient, but of course we have to deduce the depositional\nprocesses, and deduction can be very dangerous when one is dealing with\nphenomena as complex as turbulent two-phase flow (in the parlance of the fluid\ndynamicist).\n2.10 Keep in mind that a given stratum may not have a very great lateral\nextent. If you were able to follow or trace your stratum laterally, what would\nhappen to it? It would either change gradually into another stratum or it would\ndisappear by pinching our or wedging out. Distances vary greatly, from just a few\nmeters to hundreds of kilometers.\n\n3. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\n\n3.1 Up until about 1800, thinking about the Earth's past was largely flood-\ndominated, except for a few who were ahead of their time, like Leonardo da Vinci,\nwho perceived the true significance of fossils in rocks. Nicolaus Steno (born Niels\nStensen; 1638-1686), who should be considered the father of stratigraphy,\nrecognized not only the significance of fossils but also the true nature of strata.\nHis thinking has been summarized in the form of Steno's Laws (although\n\"principles\" would be a better choice of word than \"laws\"):\n\n- superposition: younger rocks are deposited on older rocks\n- original horizontality: strata were close to being horizontal when they\nwere originally deposited.\n- original lateral continuity: strata were originally laterally extensive\nrelative to their thickness when they were deposited.\n\nI suppose that these things seem obvious to you now, but they were revolutionary\nin Steno's time, and they profoundly affected the practice of geology.\n3.2 In the earliest 1800s, William Smith in England and Georges Cuvier in\nFrance used the successions of faunas in stratified rocks for mapping. This led to\nthe development of the principle called the law of faunal succession: distinct\nfaunas succeed one another regularly in the rocks. Why fossil faunas work this\nway was not well understood, however, until the middle 1800s, as a result of the\nwork of Darwin and Wallace.\n3.3 The whole record of stratified rocks was well worked out by the middle\nof the 1800s, and almost all of the periods and subdivisions thereof we use today\n\nhad been established. But the modern approach to the detailed stratigraphy of\nindividual areas did not develop until the early 1900s. Later on, after some more\npreparation, we'll deal with another of what might be called the great principles of\nstratigraphy: Walther's law of facies.\n\n4. SUCCESSIONS OF STRATA\n\n4.1 Now think about the sequence of strata you would see in one big\noutcrop, or in a series of outcrops in a small area. This is called a local section.\nEven though the physical dimensions of the outcrop might be fairly\n\"equidimensional\", you are seeing a stack of strata in essentially one dimension,\nbecause the changes from stratum to stratum in the sequence are almost always\nmuch more rapid and substantial, per unit distance, than lateral changes along the\nstrata. Figure 8-2 is a cartoon of an outcrop that shows a local section, along with\na schematic column that represents the section you might measure and describe.\nC\nartoon of an outcrop.\n\n4.2 It turns out that in any given area, deposition is usually non-uniform in\nboth space and time; the nature of deposition changes laterally at a given time, and\nit changes with time at a given point.\n\n4.3 It also usually turns out that gradients of deposition in space and time\nare also non-uniform: at certain times and places, changes are faster and more\nabrupt. This means that we have a good chance of recognizing what we could\nthink of as natural rock units. When we examine a local vertical section we\nusually find that vertical variations are not entirely random or chaotic. Instead,\nthere is usually some natural ordering or \"signal\" such that the stack can be\nsubdivided into rock units that show a high degree of internal sameness compared\nwith rocks above and below.\n4.4 For example, if we could have seen more of the local section shown\nabove, we might have seen the section shown in Figure 8-3 (here represented more\ngenerally and in less detail).\n\nA stratigraphic section.\n\n4.5 Contacts between sedimentary rock units can be\n\n- gradational by continuous change\n- gradational by interbedding\n- abrupt by change in deposition\n- abrupt by erosional break\n\n4.6 Now think about what you would see if you traced the beds and rock\nunits laterally--that is, if you hunted up neighboring local sections, maybe\n\nkilometers to tens of kilometers away from the highway cut shown above, but in\nthe same part of the stratigraphic column.\n4.7 Because except in unusual depositional settings the individual beds have\nlateral dimensions smaller than kilometers to tens of kilometers, you should not\nexpect to see exactly the same beds in the neighboring local sections. (Keep in\nmind that you generally wouldn't really know that, because most beds aren't\ndistinctive enough to be recognized among a whole lot of other similar beds.) But\nthe rock units you recognized at the highway cut probably would be recognizable\nin neighboring sections.\n4.8 Your natural inclination would probably to be a \"layer-caker\" and\nassume that the times represented by the contacts between rock units are the same\nfrom section to section. But you would generally be far wrong in such an\nassumption! One tip-off would be to find some unique bed in all the sections, like\na distinctive bed of volcanic ash, and see where it lies in the section relative to the\nrock-unit contacts. (Such a bed is called a key bed.) It would generally be in\ndifferent positions from section to section. To investigate this effect we have to\nmake a major excursion into the nature of deposition.\n4.9 Imagine a coastal area where deposition is taking place and the sea is\nslowly advancing onto the land (either because sea level is rising around the\nworld, or because the crust is locally subsiding relative to world sea level, or a\ncombination of both; it doesn't make much difference for what we're doing here.)\nLook at a vertical cross section normal to the shoreline, shown in Figure 8-4.\n(Figure 8-4 is the most important figure in this chapter; be sure you understand the\npoints I'm trying to get across with it.)\n\nA vertical cross-section normal to the shoreline.\n\n4.10 This cross section shows the basement upon which a sedimentary\nsequence is being deposited, and the sequence of sediments that has already been\ndeposited on that basement. The dashed lines through the deposit represent\nimaginary surfaces of equal time; that is, they show where the sea floor was at a\nseries of earlier times.\n4.11 Look first at the distribution of sediment types on the present sea floor.\nI have drawn belts of sediment parallel to the shoreline, with finer and finer\nsediment farther and farther from shore. Often things work this way, although\noften they don't.\n4.12 It's striking that the deposit is arranged as units of differing sediment\ntype that are parallel to the basement surface. Just a little thought should\nconvince you that this comes about because the depositional belts on the sea floor\nare \"tied\" to the shoreline, and shift as the shoreline shifts. The contacts between\nthe sedimentary units therefore cut across the time surfaces. This nonparallelism\nof time surfaces and depositional-unit boundaries is termed diachrony (adjective:\ndiachronous).\n4.13 (I should point out here that there's a lot of vertical exaggeration in my\ncartoon diagram; the angles between the time surfaces and the depositional-unit\ncontacts are very small, because we're dealing with a thickness of tens to hundreds\nof meters over a shore-normal distance of some tens of kilometers.)\n4.14 Note that the sequence of sediment belts on the present sea floor from\nthe shoreline seaward is the same as the sequence of depositional units you would\nfind vertically downward from some point on the sea floor. This is the\nmanifestation of what's called Walther's Law of Facies, the last great principle of\nstratigraphy I want to tell you about:\n\nThe lateral distribution of facies on a depositional surface is the\nsame as the vertical distribution of these same facies in a vertical\nsection through the deposits.\n\n(The term facies, in very common use in sedimentology and stratigraphy, refers to\ndistinctive kinds of sedimentary deposits.)\n4.15 The advance of the sea onto the land is called a transgression, or\nmarine transgression, and the resulting sedimentary succession is called a\ntransgressive succession.\n4.16 Now take a closer look at the depositional units in the picture above.\nLook at one small part of the contact zone between, say, the sand unit and the mud\nunit, and blow it up to a much larger scale (Figure 8-5).\n\nC\no\nn\nt\na\nc\nt\n\nzone between sand unit and mud unit.\n\n4.17 Because of the irregularly shifting nature of the depositional belts over\ngeologically short times (caused by such things as minor fluctuations in sea level\nsuperimposed on the general rise, or minor fluctuations in climate, or inherent\nvariability in depositional processes) the boundary would be very jiggly in cross\nsection.\n4.18 On an even smaller scale, that of individual beds, you would see more\njiggliness, caused by such things as storm events (Figure 8-6).\n\nT\nh\ne\n\nn\na\nt\nu\nr\ne of the contact between sand unit and mud unit.\n\n4.19 Once this sequence was buried, lithified, uplifted, and eroded for you to\nsee as an outcrop of ancient rock, you would see a succession of interbedded\nsandstones and shales much like the cartoon outcrop along the highway earlier in\nthis chapter.\n4.20 The perceptive student might wonder how the picture in Figures 8-4\nthrough 8-6 would differ if sea level was falling and the shoreline was moving\nseaward. Such a situation is called a marine regression (Figure 8-7).\n\nMarine regression.\n\n4.21\nFinally, Figure 8-8 shows another example of the nonparallelism\nof time surfaces and depositional-unit boundaries, this time\nextreme: filling of a fault trough with sediments shed from the\nrising block. Here, the contacts of the depositional units cut the\ntime surfaces almost at right angles!\n\nA vertical section through a sedimentary basin.\n\n5. MORE ON ROCK UNITS\n\n5.1 Here's some material on the more formal aspects of physical (i.e., rock-\nunit) stratigraphy. There's a conventional system for recognizing and naming\nsedimentary rock units, which all stratigraphers have to follow. And there's\nrigorous priority in naming these units, just as there is in paleontology in the\nnaming of species. Here we have to be more specific and use the term rock-\nstratigraphic unit for what I have casually been calling a depositional unit.\n5.2 The basic rock-stratigraphic unit is the formation. Here is the official\ndefinition of a formation:\n\nA genetic unit of strata deposited under essentially uniform conditions\nor an alternation of conditions. Boundaries are to be drawn at points\nin the section where lithologic features change or where there are\nsignificant breaks in continuity of sedimentation.\n\nSo the word formation in geology is very specific, and cannot easily be used\nas a general word outside its official stratigraphic meaning.\n\n5.3 Points about formations:\n\nrelative uniformity: A formation exhibits a relatively high degree of\nuniformity compared to surrounding strata or rock units.\nmappability: Formations should be mappable units on typical geologic map\nscales; they are not just beds but fairly thick successions of beds. Not many\nformations are thinner than several meters.\ngenetic significance: Lithologic differences can be anything, but they\nshould be as genetically significant as possible.\ntime: There is no element of time in the definition; as you have seen from\nthe example of a marine transgression above, a formation can (and in fact usually\ndoes) represent different spans of time in different places.\nexhaustiveness: You are supposed to subdivide a local section exhaustively\n(and non-overlappingly) into formations. Of course, the number of places in the\nworld where a stratigrapher gets a shot at a totally undescribed section is getting\nsmaller and smaller. Nowadays you have to work with already-defined rock units.\nAt most, you may have to deal with tracing already-defined rock units from\nadjacent areas into your own area, and perhaps erecting additional rock units\nspecific to just your area.\nconnectedness: Formations start out as connected masses of strata, but\nsubsequent history of uplift and erosion may eventually isolate certain parts of the\nformation from other parts. (This brings up the sometimes difficult problem of\nwhen to apply a different name. On the other hand, often the name changes at\nstate boundaries!)\nsubdivision: Formations may be subdivided into members, tongues, and\nlenses. And they can be grouped into groups. But none of this is required.\nPractice is fairly flexible: (1) part of a formation can be subdivided and parts not;\n(2) the subdivisions can be formally named or just informal; and (3) some\nformations can be put into groups and others in the same section not.\npreservation: Preservation of rock units varies enormously, from total (in\nthe subsurface) to partial (subsurface plus eroded edges forming outcrop) to very\ncut up and scrappy (by later tectonism and erosion).\ntype section: The erector of the formation is supposed to choose a type\nsection--a local section that embodies his/her concept of the formation well. This\nserves to tie down the concept so that it won't \"drift\" with later study by others.\nconvention for naming: Formations are named after geographic places; the\nsecond part of the name is either the dominant rock type or simply the word\n\"Formation\".\n\nsacredness: You can't monkey with somebody's formation unless there is\ncompelling evidence that the earlier guy was wrong.\n\n6. UNCONFORMITIES\n\n6.1 All stratified successions had to be deposited on some preexisting\nsurface, and commonly that surface must have been subjected to substantial\nerosion before deposition commenced. The contact between the stratified\nsuccession and the underlying rock is called an unconformity. (The term is also\nused in the abstract, without either definite or indefinite article, for the relationship\nsuch a contact represents.) The underlying rock itself may or may not be\nstratified. Geologic time is unrecorded at the unconformity surface; the time break\nmay range from geologically short (perhaps only some hundreds of thousands of\nyears) to a substantial fraction of all geologic time.\n6.2 The unconformity surface can be cut into crystalline rock (Figure 8-9) or\ninto deformed sedimentary strata (Figure 8-10). If the rock beneath the\nunconformity is stratified, it commonly shows evidence of deformation;\nunconformities showing angular discordance between the strata above and below\nare called angular unconformities. In the figures, the strata above the\nunconformity are shown to be concordant with the unconformity surface itself.\nThis is usually what you see, but it need not be true locally, because if sediment is\ndeposited on an irregular surface the strata may abut against the surface at some\nangle, depending on the mode of deposition. This is called a buttress\nunconformity (Figure 8-11). An unconformity on crystalline rock.\n\nA buttress unconformity.\n\n6.3 Common within conformable sedimentary sequences are\ndisconformities--surfaces representing breaks in time without any discordance\nof strata. Disconformities represent temporary cessation of deposition, and these\nnondepositional episodes may or may not be accompanied by erosion of the\npreexisting sediment. Where there is erosion of the underlying sediment the\ndisconformity is said to be an erosional disconformity. If there is no erosion, the\npresence of the disconformity is difficult or impossible to detect. The break or\ngap in time represented by a disconformity is called a hiatus or a diastem.\n6.4 Although some sedimentary successions, especially those deposited in\ndeeper marine environments, are truly continuous, most sedimentary successions\npreserved in the geologic record are discontinuous. In fact, in some sequences,\nespecially very thin successions deposited over very long times, many or most\nbeds must be separated from underlying and overlying beds by disconformities.\nSometimes we actually observe this, but even when we don't, it seems a\nreasonable assumption, because rates of deposition of individual beds, interpreted\nfrom what we know from modern environments, would give far greater\nthicknesses over the long times known to be represented by such successions.\n\nWithout good evidence from fossils, it is impossible to evaluate the significance of\nthese hiatuses.\n6.5 Figure 8-12 is a sketch of a disconformity involving both erosion and\nchange in sediment type; these are easy to spot. Figure 8-13 is a sketch of a\ndisconformity without either erosion or change in sediment type; such\nunconformities are difficult or impossible to detect.\n\nA\n\nd\ni\ns\nc\nonformity involving erosion and change type.\nA\n\nd\ni\ns\nc\no\nn\nformity without erosion or change type.\n\n7. TIME IN STRATIGRAPHY\n\n7.1 I have not said much yet about the time relations of strata. First of all,\nlet me remind you that in many sections, especially those deposited in nonmarine\nenvironments like rivers and in shallow-marine environments, much or even most\nof the time is unrepresented by rocks but is represented instead by hiatuses or\ndiastems (breaks in the record).\n\n7.2 You can still recognize natural rock units, because depositional\nconditions can be about the same for long periods of time, but deposition might\nrepresent only a very small fraction of the time. This is one of the major reasons\nwhy formations can look about the same from place to place but vary greatly in\ntheir thickness.\n7.3 On the other hand, many sections represent slow and continuous\ndeposition, so all of the time is recorded. It's a matter of the particular\nenvironment of deposition: nonmarine and shallow-marine sections are likely to\nbe full of holes, whereas deeper marine sections are likely to be continuous.\n7.4 Rock units are defined without regard to time. The critical operation in\ncomparing local sections is correlation: establishing the time equivalence among\nstrata in various areas. This can range in scale from local areas to worldwide.\n7.5 There are four ways of telling time, and therefore making time\ncorrelation, in geology:\n\nradioisotopic dating: this has been of enormous importance in establishing\nabsolute ages in geology (it's the only way of doing that), but in the context of\nstratigraphy it's generally too imprecise for anything but the broadest stratigraphic\ncorrelation.\nmagnetostratigraphy: This is good for rocks that are only a few million\nyears old, but it's not of general applicability in stratigraphy.\nfossils: This is the standard way of correlating strata. The succession of\nfaunas (and to a lesser extent floras) is so well worked out for much of\nPhanerozoic time that correlation can be fairly precise. Obviously this provides\nonly relative time, not absolute time. And there is the practical problem that not\nall sedimentary rocks are fossiliferous--in fact, the majority are unfossiliferous.\nMore on paleontology and correlation by fossils later.\nkey beds: I mentioned above that if you know you have one or more\nunambiguously recognizable beds in your sections, like ash beds, you can tell\nrelative time with satisfying precision. The trouble is that such key beds are not at\nall common.\nchemostratigraphy: In recent years, the isotopic signature of sediments can\nbe used to make correlations among widely separated sections, even worldwide.\nThat is especially true of times in geologic history when there were glaciations and\ndeglaciations. The isotopic ratio of the two naturally occurring stable isotopes of\ncarbon, 12C and 13C, have been especially useful in that regard.\n\n7.6 Two other kinds of stratigraphic units, in addition to lithologic units, are\nofficially defined in stratigraphy. These have time as an essential part of their\ndefinition.\n\nTime-stratigraphic units (also called time-rock units or chronostratigraphic\nunits): units of rock that contain all the rock (in the world!) that were deposited\nbetween two different times.\nTime units (or chronologic units): units, defined by time itself, that contain\nall the time between two different times.\n\nThese two kinds of units are not erected independently of one another; they come\nin pairs.\n7.7 Table 8-1 gives the conventional hierarchy of time units and time-\nstratigraphic units. A few comments on this table:\nHierarchy of time units and time-stratigraphic units.\n\n- Systems/periods are always worldwide\n- Epochs/series are sometimes worldwide\n- Ages/stages are never worldwide\n\n7.8 There are zillions of names for these units, usually taken from place\nnames. They always end in -ian or -an. Many are real tongue-twisters. I would\nbe willing to bet that no one ever learns them all; you get familiar with just the\nones relevant to the rocks you're working with.\n\n8. SEA-LEVEL CHANGE\n\n8.1 I am sure you know already that sea level changes with time. Much is\nmade these days about sea-level changes on time scales of decades to a few\ncenturies, owing to the likelihood of worldwide sea-level rise caused by (1)\nmelting of continental glaciers and (2) expansion of the oceanic water column as a\nconsequence of rising water temperature in the oceans. Sedimentary geologists\nare concerned with sea-level changes on time scales of centuries to tens of\nmillions of years because of the influence of such changes on the sedimentary\nrecord.\n8.2 Several processes can cause sea-level changes at a point in the world's\noceans:\n\n- vertical tectonic movements (uplift or subsidence) of the lithosphere\n- compaction of the sedimentary column below the given locality\n- worldwide changes in sea level caused by changes in the volume of\nwater in the oceans or by rise or fall of the sea floor.\n\nThe third process above is known as eustasy (note the spelling: not eustacy).\nEustasy is defined as a change in the elevation of sea level worldwide relative to\nsome stationary datum at depth. There is a fundamental problem here, though:\nhow does one define or specify that datum? The center of the Earth would be a\ngood one, in theory, but it's unworkable in practice. Other datums you might\nconsider suffer from the problem that they are susceptible to vertical movements\nthemselves. For that reason, geoscientists deal with relative sea level: sea level\nrelative to the sea bottom in a given locality.\n8.3 Eustatic sea level can change by virtue of changes in the volume of\ncontinental glaciers. The water contained in glacier ice is ultimately derived from\nthe oceans, and when a glacier melts it delivers the meltwater back to the oceans.\nBut there is another cause of eustatic sea-level change. You know that there is a\nworldwide system of mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic lithosphere is\n\ncontinuously created. The mid-ocean ridges stand higher than the surrounding\nocean floor not because of upward-directed forces underneath them but because\nthey are hotter than the surrounding oceanic lithosphere and therefore more\nexpanded. It has been generally accepted since early in the plate-tectonics era that\nthe increase in ocean depths away from the mid-ocean ridges is well explained by\nprogressive cooling of the lithospheric plates as they move away from the\nspreading axis. At times when plate tectonics is more active worldwide, the mid-\nocean ridges, being hotter, stand higher than at times of relative plate-tectonic\nquiescence. This has the effect of raising sea level relative to the surfaces of the\ncontinents.\n8.4 Although the effects of these two processes on sea level are the same, the\ntime scales are widely different. Eustatic sea-level changes caused by growth of\nshrinkage of glaciers, called glacioeustatic (or glacio-eustatic) changes, occur on\ntime scales of centuries to millions of years (and most of the changes are on time\nscales of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, the range of time\nscales referred to as the Milankovitch band, having to do with periodic changes in\nthe Earth's orbital parameters). Eustatic sea-level changes caused by changes in\nthe elevation of the ocean floor occur on much longer time scales of tens to\nhundreds of millions of years. Consequently, sedimentary geologists need to deal\nwith the signature of eustatic sea-level changes in the sedimentary record on a\nvery wide range of time scales.\n8.5 Sedimentary geologists commonly classify the time scales of sea-level\nchanges in terms of orders: first order (the longest), second, order, and so on to as\nhigh as fifth order (the shortest). Be warned, however, that different workers have\ndifferent views of what constitutes these orders!\n8.6 When relative sea level fluctuates in cycles, the time in the cycle when\nsea level is highest is called the highstand, and the time in the cycle when sea\nlevel is lowest is called the lowstand.\n8.7 Just to give you the flavor of how fluctuations in sea level affect the\nsedimentary record, look at Figure 8-14, which shows a cross section normal to a\ntypical continental-shelf depositional setting. The little graph shows one segment\nof the curve of repetitive rises and falls in sea level, by perhaps several meters.\n(The curve isn't necessarily symmetrical like the sine wave I've shown for\nsimplicity.) Because slopes on shelves are usually quite small, just a few degrees,\neven fairly small vertical changes in sea level cause the shoreline to move back\nand forth for long distances, tens to even hundreds of kilometers.\n\nC\nr\no\ns\ns\n-\ns\nection n\normal to\n\na\n\ns\nhore\nli\nne.\nL\n\n8.8 Point A wouldn't be greatly affected, because it's always on land and\ntherefore undergoing at least slow erosion. Likewise, Point D, in deep water and\nfar from land, would always be undergoing slow deposition of fine sediment and\nwould be little affected. But at Point C, always below sea level but subjected to\ngreat relative changes in water depth and distance from shore, the marine\nsedimentary section that gets deposited would show great differences in facies\nover a single sea-level cycle. The same is true for Point B, which is alternately\nsubmergent and emergent; there you should expect to see a disconformity in the\nsedimentary section in each sea-level cycle, representing the time during which the\narea is emergent and undergoing partial erosion of sediment deposited during the\nprevious high stand of sea level.\n8.9 As you can imagine, analysis of the kinds of local sedimentary sections\nthat are deposited during such fluctuations in sea level get much more intricate\nthan this: they depend upon such things as the magnitude, shape, and periodicity\nof the sea-level curve, the shape of the bathymetric profile of the shelf, the climate\nin the region, and the sediment supply from land, and other things as well. This is\nan area of stratigraphy that's just in recent years being applied to reexamination of\nancient depositional settings around the world, and is leading to great advances in\ninterpretation of ancient depositional processes.\n\n9. SOME TERMINOLOGY FOR IMPORTANT CONCEPTS\n\n9.1 In this course you have already learned some things about transgression\nand regression. The term transgression is used for the advance of the shoreline in\nthe landward direction, owing either to crustal subsidence or to worldwide rise in\nsea level. Used without a preceding article (transgression), the term refers to the\nconcept or the process; used with a preceding article (a transgression; the\n\nFigure 8-14: Cross section norm\n\nal to a shoreline, to illustrate the effect of cyclic\nfluctuation. s in sea level on sediment deposition\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\ntransgression), the term refers to a particular event. The opposite of transgression\nis regression: the retreat of the shoreline away from land.\n9.2 I would like to show you, here, in the form of Figure 8-15: Prothero,\nD.R., and Schwab, F., 1996, Sedimentary Geology; An Introduction to\nSedimentary Rocks and Stratigraphy: Freeman, 575 p. (Figure 15.16, p. 346) and\nFigure 8-16: Prothero, D.R., and Schwab, F., 1996, Sedimentary Geology; An\nIntroduction to Sedimentary Rocks and Stratigraphy: Freeman, 575 p. (Figure\n15.17, p. 347), two all-time classic examples of transgressive and regressive\nsuccessions. In Figure 8-15 you can see how, at any given time, Devonian\ndepositional facies across New York State ranged from nonmarine in the east to\noffshore marine in the west. As time went on, the shoreline shifted to the west,\nand with it, the depositional facies. In Figure 8-16 you can see how the Cambrian\nsea, advancing from west to east in the Grand Canyon area, left a transgressive\nsuccession that started with basal coarse siliciclastics, grading up into finer\nsiliciclastics, and then into carbonates.\n9.3 You should also know that the term progradation refers to the building\nor shifting of depositional units seaward, and the term retrogradation refers to the\nshifting of depositional units landward. The term aggradation refers to building\nof depositional units vertically upward, neither aggradational or retrogradational.\nThe important term accommodation (sometimes termed accommodation space) is\nused for the space made available for sediment deposition below sea level.\nAccommodation is developed by crustal subsidence and/or sea-level rise.\n\n10. SEQUENCE STRATIGRAPHY\n\n10.1 Introduction\n\n10.1.1 It has been recognized since the early days of modern geology that\nsea-level change, resulting in transgression and regression, gives rise to a vertical\nsuccession of sedimentary facies in a given area, by virtue of the control of water\ndepth on the nature of the sedimentation. (The old saying was: \"The seas went in,\nthe seas went out\".) The organized patterns of cyclic variation in stratigraphic\nsections occasioned by fluctuations in sea level come under the heading of\nsequence stratigraphy--the hottest new area in the old field of stratigraphy.\n10.1.2 Beginning in the middle of the Twentieth Century, this notion was\nput on a more systematic basis by the recognition of what were called sequences:\npackages of transgressive-regressive deposits bounded by major continent-wide\nunconformities. These sequences are believed to reflect eustatic sea-level changes\non the longest time scales, tens of millions of years. Figure 8-17: Prothero, D.R.,\nand Schwab, F., 1996, Sedimentary Geology; An Introduction to Sedimentary\nRocks and Stratigraphy: Freeman, 575 p. (Figure 15.20, p. 349) shows the\n\nsequences in the North American continent, recognized and named by Sloss\n(1963).\n10.1.3 Beginning in the late 1970s, and continuing to the present time, an\nincreasingly detailed and sophisticated picture of marine stratigraphic successions\ndeposited during times of fluctuating sea level have been developed. These\nconcepts come under the term sequence stratigraphy. It is difficult, nowadays, to\nread about marine sedimentary successions without reference to sequence\nstratigraphy.\n10.1.4 Let's start with the basic definition of a sequence, in the modern sense\nof the term. A sequence is \"a relatively conformable succession of genetically\nrelated strata bounded by unconformities and their correlative conformities\".\n(Incidentally, as with so many other terms in Earth science, a word that was\noriginally in use in a general sense has thus been co-opted for a more specialized\nusage. There is a tendency these days to substitute succession for what used to be\ncalled a sequence, and reserve sequence for its specialized usage in the context of\nsequence stratigraphy!)\n10.1.5 What are the fundamental controls on the nature of sequences? There\nare three of them:\n\n- rate of crustal subsidence\n- eustatic sea-level change: magnitude and period\n- rate of supply of siliciclastic sediment from land, and/or rate of\nproduction of carbonate sediment in the depositional area\n\n10.1.6 The first two of these together determine the rate of change of\naccommodation. So it comes down to this, in the broadest context: the relative\nimportance of rate of increase in accommodation, making way for more sediment\ndeposition, versus the rate of supply of sediment to fill that accommodation.\nBeyond that, however, a number of other factors are of non-negligible importance\nin determining what the stratigraphic succession comes out to be. I'll mention just\ntwo here: the physiography of topography of the region, which is determined by\ntectonism, and the climate of the region, which is important in determining the\nkind of sediment that is being deposited in the first place. Figure 8-18 shows an\neven more detailed view of the many factors associated with the stratigraphy of\nthe resulting deposits.\n\n10.1.7 This is probably a good place to introduce the distinction between\ncyclic processes that are imposed upon the depositional system from outside (sea-\nlevel fluctuations, creation of accommodation) and processes that are inherent to\nthe depositional system itself: things like shifting of tidal channels or delta\ndistributary channels, which lead to vertical changes in the succession which have\nnothing directly to do with the cyclicity that is imposed by the external (\"sequence\nstratigraphic\") factors mentioned above. These processes superimpose an element\nof randomness on what is viewed as a largely deterministic process. There is\nconsiderable controversy among the experts about the relative importance of these\ntwo factors. A middle view is that the external signal is strong but is modified in\nsubstantial ways by internal processes.\n10.1.8 Finally, here is a very important point: there is no such thing as a\nsingle sequence-stratigraphic model. If the rate of subsidence, the magnitude and\nperiod of sea-level change, and the rate and nature of sediment supply were\nalways the same, there could be a useful such model In reality, however, each of\nthese fundamental governing parameters can take on a wide range of values. For\nthat reason, the nature of the resulting overall stratigraphic architecture--that is,\nthe whole three-dimensional nature of the resulting deposit--varies extremely\nwidely. (A cynic might claim that that's a good thing for sedimentary geology,\nbecause it will keep sedimentary geologists busy for a long time!)\n\nFigure 8-18: Interrelationships\n\nof the various factors, processes, or parameters that can\ninfluence the nature of a m\n\narine sedimentary succession\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFactors associated with th\ne stratigrap\nhy.\n\n10.2 Stratigraphy in the Subsurface: Interpreting Seismic Profiles\n\n10.2.1 Many stratigraphers work mostly with subsurface data rather than\noutcrop data. The principal source of subsurface data is seismic reflection,\nwhereby energy of vibration is created along a line on the land surface and the\ntwo-way travel time of seismic waves that reach certain reflecting layers and\nreturn to the surface. (An assumption needs to be made about the speed of the\nseismic waves through the medium, to convert to depths.) The data are processed\nin increasingly sophisticated ways by computers and are displayed, traditionally,\nas vertical sections or, nowadays, as gorgeous rotatable see-through cubes.\nResolution has gotten down to as little as a few meters vertically--not quite bed\nby bed, but good enough to see much stratigraphic detail. To the novice, a seismic\nsection looks like a tangle of wiggly lines, but the practiced eye can perceive much\norders stratigraphic information. Once guiding lines are drawn along various\nsurfaces, the relationships become apparent even to a casual observer.\n10.2.2 What makes for a reflector? Any boundary between two layers with\ndifferent densities and seismic wave speeds. The relevant quantity is called the\nacoustic impedance, which is the product of the density of the medium and the\nwave speed of the medium.\n10.2.3 Several kinds of relationships of sedimentary layers are characteristic\nof seismic reflection profiles (Figure 8-19). A clinoform is an inclined surface,\nreflecting the sloping seafloor (or lake floor!) on which a body of strata is\ndeposited. The usual interpretation of clinoform is that they represent the\nprogradation geometry of sediment packages that build out into deeper water.\nAlso commonly seen on seismic sections are unconformities, about which you\nlearned earlier in this chapter. Unconformities usually involve actual erosional\ntruncation.\nK\ni\nn\nd\ns\n\no\nf\n\nr\ne\nlationships of sedime\nntary strata.\n\nFigure 8-19: Kinds of relationships of sedimentary strata that are characteristic of seismic\nreflection profiles\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n10.2.4 There are also various kinds of \"laps\":\\\n\nonlap, by which packages of strata with relatively gentle dip are banked up\nagainst an older package of strata with greater dip.\ndownlap, by which inclined a package of inclined strata terminates\ndownward against a less steeply dipping package of strata.\nofflap, a pattern in which packages of strata build upward and outward into\ndeeper water of a basin.\ntoplap, by which inclined strata, commonly clinoforms, terminate upward\nagainst a less steeply dipping, often almost horizontal, surface. There need\nnot be erosional truncation.\n\n10.3 The Nature of Sequences\n\n10.3.1 A whole course could be given on sequence stratigraphy. Here I'll\njust give you a general idea of how sequences are built and what they look like.\n10.3.2 Think about what happens in the course of a single cycle of sea-level\nchange. Suppose that there is a broad, shallow shelf area, bounded on one side by\nland and on the other side by a slope that leads to a relatively deep marine basin.\nAs sea level falls, the siliciclastic sediment supplied from land, or the carbonate\nsediment produced locally, is deposited in progressively shallower water. That\nresults in a shallowing-upward succession. If the fall in sea level is sufficiently\ngreat, much of the depositional area becomes emergent, and is subjected to\nerosion. Sediment mobilized in this way is deposited on the slope or carried into\nthe deep basin, commonly in the form of sediment gravity flows in canyons\nincised into the seaward margin of the shelf. A lowstand wedge of relatively\ndeep-water sediment is thus deposited, and an unconformity is generated in the\nshallower areas. By convention, the sequence boundary is placed at this\nunconformity. As sea level rises again, the depositional area is progressively\nflooded. Any sediment deposited during this stage of rising sea level ends up as a\ndeepening-upward succession. Such sediment is commonly either thin or missing\nentirely, however, for an understandable reason: siliciclastic sediment derived\nfrom land is stored far landward as river valleys incised during lowstand are\nflooded to become estuaries. This effectively shuts off the supply of sediment\nfrom land. This part of the succession is often described as a condensed section,\nbecause sedimentation rates of the fine siliciclastics are often extremely low.\nSomewhere in the condensed section lies what is called the maximum flooding\nsurface, representing the time of sea-level highstand. (In reality, it's usually more\nlike a maximum-flooding zone than a well-defined surface.) Eventually, as\nhighstand conditions are approached and then reached, rates of sedimentation on\n\nthe shelf increase again, and tend to coarsen (and shallow) upward. The cycle\nthen repeats itself.\n10.3.3 If you think carefully about the scenario described above, the\nresulting deposit, bounded by unconformities that developed because of subaerial\nexposure and erosion as lowstand is approached, has a strong asymmetry: the\nrising-sea-level (transgressive) deposits are relatively thin and fine grained, and\nthe falling-sea-level (regressive) deposits are relatively thick and coarse-grained.\nCorrespondingly, most of the thickness of the sequence consists of shallowing-\nupward deposits. That's one of the significant aspects of sequences.\n10.3.4 Sequence-stratigraphic terminology gets much more intricate (and\npotentially confusing) than this. I will mention here only one set of terms. The\nterm systems tract (I have always thought the term to be not very felicitous) refers\nto distinct packages of sediment that are deposited during specific phases of the\nse-level cycle: highstand system tract, lowstand systems tract, transgressive\nsystems tract, falling-stage systems tract.\n10.3.5 Recall that I mentioned earlier that there can be several distinct orders\nof sea-level cyclicity, from as short as centuries or millennia to as long as tens of\nmillions of years. For that reason, one often has to deal with sedimentary\nsuccessions deposited during more than one order of sea-level cycle. the result is:\nthinner and shorter-term sequences superimposed on thicker and longer-term\nsequences! In particular, the term parasequence is used for the shortest-period\nand thinnest such cycles, typically with thicknesses on the scale of one to a few\nmeters, which are superposed on thicker sequences that may be tens to a hundred\nmeters thick.\n10.3.6 It's not easy to draw a diagram (a vertical cross section normal to the\nshoreline) that shows the essence of sequence stratigraphy without the diagram\nbeing overly complicated and confusing. Figures 8-20 and 8-21 show two\nexamples, taken from the literature on sequence stratigraphy, that might help you.

      "content": "CHAPTER 9A\n\nPALEOBIOLOGY\n\nPART I. PRECAMBRIAN LIFE\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Life on Earth began early. The oldest undoubted fossils are about 3500\nmillion years old, back in the early Archean--and, as you will see in a later\nsection of this chapter, the earliest fossil organisms are very similar to organisms\nthat are abundant and successful today. These organisms, although primitive\ncompared to advanced metazoans (like us), are, in an absolute sense, rather\nadvanced in their physiology. It's generally agreed that the earliest life, earlier\nthan that represented by the oldest fossils, must have been much simpler and less\nsophisticated biochemically The clear implication is that life must have evolved\nmuch earlier than 3.5 Ga--although it is doubtful if fossils much older than that\nwill ever be found. Why not? Perhaps largely because the sedimentary rocks in\nwhich they would have been preserved are no longer around, in pristine,\nunmetamorphosed condition, for us to scrutinize.\n1.2 This section purports to tell you something about the nature and\nevolution of life in the Precambrian (more specifically, up to the latter part of the\nProterozoic; for the rise of eukaryotic organisms in general, and multicellular\neukaryotes in particular, late in the Proterozoic, see the following section). For the\nsake of full disclosure here, I should point out that I am a novice in biology! I feel\nmyself to be especially inadequate when it comes to the biochemistry of metabolic\nprocess and the molecular biology of replication and inheritance. With that\ndisclaimer, however, I have attempted here to present to you the basics of the\nfossil record of the Precambrian and some of its implications for the early\nevolution of life. If you have a special interest in paleontology, and in particular\nthe earliest life you might consider going into the literature. I have provided a\nfairly long list of materials, largely review papers by specialists in the field.\n1.3 Just to set the stage at this early point in the chapter, Figure 9-1 is a\ndiagram that shows, in a very generalized way, the known distribution of\nstromatolites and microbial microfossils through geologic time. The clear\nmessage from Figure 9-1 is that the Archean fossil record is scanty but real, and\nthe Proterozoic fossil record is far more abundant. The terms used in Figure 9-1,\nas well as some of the place names, will be elaborated later in this section.\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 9-1: Diagram showing the known distrib\n\nution of stromatolites and microbial\nrnicrofossils through geologic time\n\n2. THE KINGDOM OF LIFE\n\n2.1 Back when I was a child, the standard idea was that life was divided into\nthe plant kingdom and the animal kingdom. (In fairness to biologists, I should\npoint out that the experts knew then that the situation was more complicated:\nwhat to do about fungi, for example?). Progress on deciphering the \"tree of life\"\n(that is, the evolutionary development of the various life forms known today,\nthrough geologic time, from a presumably common original ancestor) has been\ntruly spectacular in recent years. With the development of techniques for\n\nT\nh\ne\n\nk\nn\no\nw\nn\n\nd\nistribution\n\no\nf\n\ns\nt\nr\no\nm\na\nt\no\nlit\nes a\nnd microbial microfossils.\n\nexamining the genetic material carried by RNA and DNA, it is now possible to\ntrace evolutionary lineages back in time. (I would have included a \"background\nsection\" on that, but I think that it would have taken me weeks, not just days, to\nproduce an adequate one, given the very steep learning curve I would have faced.)\nBiologists now have a fairly generally accepted picture of the \"tree of life\".\nBefore considering that, however, we need to deal with some rather intricate\nterminology for organisms and their metabolic processes.\n2.2 The basic distinction among organisms is between unicellular\norganisms and multicellular organisms. Among the unicellular organisms, there\nis another fundamental distinction: between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.\nProkaryotes are relatively primitive unicellular organisms in which the protoplasm\nand the genetic material are encased within a cell wall of some kind but the\ngenetic material is not located within a nucleus. Eukaryotes are relatively\nadvanced unicellular organisms in which the genetic material is enclosed in a\nspecial nucleus within the cell. Prokaryotes reproduce asexually, whereas\neukaryotes reproduce sexually. (The implication of that is that the pace of\nevolution was very slow early on, but quickened with the advent of eukaryotes,\nbecause sexual reproduction allows the ever-arising mutations to spread rapidly\nthrough an interbreeding population, leading to Darwinian evolution through\nnatural selection processes.) The earliest fossils are believed to be prokaryotic;\neukaryotic organisms evolved in the course of the Proterozoic.\n2.3 All organisms can be classified as either heterotrophic or autotrophic.\nA heterotrophic organism obtains its raw-material energy resources (its \"food\")\nfrom preexisting organic matter (or abiotic organic molecules). An autotrophic\norganism synthesizes its own organic materials by conversion of simple inorganic\ncompounds, making use of a variety of external energy sources.\n2.4 There seems to be a general consensus that the very earliest organisms\nmust have been heterotrophs, because heterotrophs can be simpler in their\nmetabolic processes than autotrophs. In that view, the more advanced autotrophic\nlife forms evolved from early heterotrophs. The problem with widespread\nheterotrophy is that eventually the organisms use up whatever stock of \"food\" is\navailable, and without autotrophy, no more \"food\" is produced--except perhaps\nby the continuing inorganic synthesis of abiotic organic molecules, which would\nnot have been produced in any great abundance.\n2.5 Depending on the form of energy utilized, autotrophs can be classified\nas either chemoautotrophic or photoautotrophic. Chemoautotrophic organisms\nuse chemical energy to fuel their processes of biochemical synthesis. Such\norganisms are known to exist today, perhaps most spectacularly in the deep ocean,\nin the vicinity of hydrothermal vents (called, picturesquely, \"black smokers\")\nassociated with mid-ocean spreading ridges. Photoautotrophic organisms use\nsolar energy for their processes of synthesis.\n\n2.6 Photosynthesis is a complex set of biochemical processes. The basic\nnature of all photosynthesis is to start with some relatively reduced compound\nthat's stable in the natural environment, and oxidize it using solar radiation as the\nsource of the needed energy to drive the reaction, and using certain compounds,\nlike chlorophyll, as catalysts to enable the reaction to happen. The general\nreaction can be written as\n\nCO2 + 2H2X + light energy → (CH2O) + H2O + 2X\n\nThe representative of element \"X\" in this reaction that is most familiar to you is,\nof course, oxygen: by photosynthesis, the organism splits the water molecule\n(which takes a lot of energy) and combines the hydrogen released with carbon\ndioxide to manufacture carbohydrate cell material (represented here by the\nsimplest form of carbohydrate; the carbohydrate sucrose, heavier but still simple,\nhas the molecular formula C6H12O6) and free molecular oxygen. That's called\noxygenic photosynthesis (and the organisms that do it are called oxygenic\nphotoautotrophs). Many organisms do not have chlorophyll and so can't use\noxygen for the \"X\" in photosynthesis. Many bacteria contain compounds\ncatalytically similar to chlorophyll that enable them to use H2S, hydrogen sulfide,\nas the raw material. That kind of photosynthesis, called anoxygenic\nphotosynthesis, produces free sulfur rather than oxygen as the by-product. The\norganisms that do this are called anoxygenic photoautotrophs.\n\n2.7 Now for the main show of this section. Figure 9-2 is a diagram that\nshows, schematically, the \"tree of life\" (which is more properly called a\nphylogenetic tree--that is, how the major taxa of organisms have developed\nthrough time) as it was understood in the early 1990s. (I have not discovered a\nmore recent version.)\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n2.8 Biologists now agree that there are three fundamental domains of life:\neubacteria (formal name: Bacteria); archaebacteria (formal name: Archaea); and\neukaryotes (formal name: Eucarya). This was generally known well before the\nbreakthrough in use of techniques of molecular biology to pin down the\nphylogenetic tree, but the structure of the tree was not well known. All of the\n\"branch tips\" shown in Figure 9-2 are represented by living organisms: that's\nwhat makes it possible to trace the lineages back in time. In Figure 9-2, there we\nare, up along the top, having branched off one of the four major lines of\neukaryotes, at about the same time as plants and fungi. Is it some consolation that\nwe are more closely related to slime molds than to bacteria?\n2.9 The big mystery in a diagram like that in Figure 9-2 is, of course: what\nwas the common original ancestor, represented by the open line at the bottom of\nthe diagram? It's extremely unlikely that we will ever find any direct fossil\nevidence of it in the early geologic record. Another very interesting feature of the\nphylogenetic tree in Figure 9-2 is that all of the earliest life forms seem to have\nbeen hyperthermophilic. As the term implies, a hyperthermophilic organism is\none that loves extremely high temperatures, even greater than 100°C. They are\n\nFigure 9-2: The universal phylogenetic tree. The bold lines are hyperthermopluiles\nPhylogenetic\ntree.\n\nknown from a variety of extreme Earth environments today, and they are all very\nprimitive prokaryotes, both eubacteria and archaebacteria. It's possible, of course,\nthat one or more \"deep\" branches of the tree became extinct early on. If so, we\ncan't include them in this tree. And, of course, if in addition they left no fossil\nrecord, we know nothing about them at all!\n2.10 Figure 9-3 is a version of Figure 9-2 that shows not only the\nphylogenetic tree but also a lot of information on the nature of photosynthesis, in\nthe cases of photosynthesizing organisms. What's striking, to me, about Figure 9-\n3 is that both modern multicellular plants and cyanobacteria engage in oxygenic\nphotosynthesis and, more specifically, use the same details of chemical processes\nin photosynthesis (the so-called Calvin-Benson cycle; no details here).\nCyanobacteria are an ancient kind of eubacteria, formerly called blue-green\nalgae, but now known not to be closely related to true algae. They are widespread\nand important in today's world as well--and their nature seems not greatly\ndifferent from their representatives in the earliest fossil record (see a later section).\nThe implication is that their pace of evolution has been extremely slow.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure 9-3: The universal phylogenetic tree, with information on photosynthetic\nprocesses\n\nPhylogenetic\ntree wi\nth mor\ne infor\nmatio\nn.\n\n3.1 What is a Fossil?\n\n3.1.1 A fossil can be defined, broadly, as any evidence of past plant or\nanimal life contained in a sediment or a sedimentary rock. The word comes from\nthe Latin fossilis, an adjective meaning \"dug up\". In the early days of geology, the\nterm was applied to any interesting natural object (minerals; pieces of ore; pieces\nof rock; traces of life) that were, literally, dug out of the ground. The term\ngradually came to be restricted to materials that give evidence of past life.\n3.1.2 (One qualifying note at this point, though: the mere presence of\ndisseminated organic matter in ancient rocks, which might technically fall under\nthe definition of a fossil above, is excluded by tacit agreement. And the average\nconcentration of such organic matter in sedimentary rocks is surprisingly high,\nsomething like one to two percent. More later in the course on the role of that\norganic matter in our energy-hungry modern society.)\n3.1.3 There are two kinds of fossils: body fossils and trace fossils. Body\nfossils are the actual organism or some part of it, or the imprint of the organism or\nsome part of it. Even more abundant than body fossils, however, are trace fossils,\nwhich are physical evidence of the life activities of now vanished organisms.\nTracks, trails, burrows, feeding marks, and resting marks are all trace fossils.\nTrace fossils are useful for geologists and paleontologists because certain kinds of\norganisms, which live in specific environmental conditions, make distinctive\ntraces. When you hear the word \"fossil\", you might think of shells or dinosaur\nbones. These are indeed good examples of body fossils, but there are many other\nkinds of fossils, including both body fossils and trace fossils.\n3.1.4 In relatively young sediments and rocks, the actual body parts of\norganisms are often preserved. In older rocks, however, the body parts are usually\ndissolved away, or recrystallized, or replaced by another kind of mineral. Even so,\nthe imprints of the organisms are still preserved, and they can be studied if the\nrock splits apart in the right place and the right orientation to reveal the imprint.\nPaleontologists usually collect large numbers of rock pieces and then split them in\nthe laboratory with special mechanical splitting devices to try to find at least a few\nfossils.\n\n3.2 Fossilization\n\n3.2.1 Two important things to remember about the fossil record are that it's\nimperfect and it's biased. Something like a quarter of a million fossil species have\nbeen discovered and described. This represents only a small percentage of the\nmillion and a half species known to be living today. There are certainly a lot more\nfossil species yet to be discovered, but by the same token probably only a third of\nthe species in existence today have been recognized and described so far. But\nthings are not as bad as they might seem, because almost half of today's species\n\n3. THE NATURE OF FOSSILS\n\nare insects, and only a few thousand fossil insects species are known, because of\nthe difficulty of preserving insects in the fossil record.\n3.2.1 It is clear that some organisms are readily preserved and others are\nseldom, if ever, preserved. Organisms with robust hard shells composed of\ndifficultly soluble material, like calcite, are readily preserved if the shells are\nburied permanently soon after death of the organism. For the body of an organism\nto become preserved as a fossil, it must escape destruction, at least in part, both\nbefore and after it is buried with sediments. Destruction before burial might result\nfrom chemical and/or biological decomposition, or from mechanical effects like\nabrasion and/or breakage during transport by wind or water currents, or a\ncombination of both. (Fragments produced by breakage and abrasion during\ntransport are among the major constituents of limestones. Technically, such\nparticles are fossils, and sedimentologists tend to call such stuff \"fossil fragments\",\nbut they are not beloved of paleontologists because they are not very suitable for\nfiguring out details of body morphology.) Soft-bodied organisms like worms and\njellyfish become preserved only under special circumstances, when their freshly\ndead bodies come to rest in soft, fine mud and are buried immediately. There is a\nvery high probability that any organism on Earth will be either consumed by\nanother organism or decomposed by microorganisms following death. For an\norganism or body part to become a fossil, it must either live within or be moved to\na place where it can be buried and isolated from decay. The more rapid the\nburial, the less decay and the better the chance of preservation. Burial alone,\nhowever, does not guarantee that fossilization will occur, because conditions\nconducive to decomposition or dissolution often persist to great depths of burial.\nWe have to assume that only a minuscule percentage of organisms become\npreserved in the sedimentary record.\n3.2.2 During the latter part of geologic time, at least, most subaerial\nenvironments (those exposed to the open air rather than being underwater) have\nbeen fully oxygenated, so the soft tissues of dead organisms, whether plants or\nanimals, are susceptible to decay. Microorganisms like bacteria are especially\nimportant in facilitating such decomposition. Many if not most subaqueous\n(underwater) environments are also oxygenated, owing to the ability of water to\ndissolve the oxygen of the atmosphere--although the geologic record tells us that\nthat have been times in geologic history when the oceans were largely stagnant,\nand reducing environments, in which organic matter accumulated in abundance,\nwere widespread.\n3.2.3 For organisms to escape decay, burial must be extremely rapid, or the\ndepositional environment must be anoxic (without the presence of oxygen). Some\nof the best-preserved soft body fossils have been found in deposits that are\ninterpreted to have formed in marine basins in which there is little or no vertical\nexchange of water, so that the bottom waters are stagnant, but at the same time\nthere is a rain of organic matter from the near-surface waters, the result being\nanoxic bottom waters. Free-floating organisms that fall to the bottom in such a\n\nwater body have an excellent chance of preservation. Probably the best modern\nexample of such an environment is the Black Sea.\n3.2.4 Hard skeletal materials, like bones and shells, have a far high\nprobability of preservation than soft tissues. For a bone or shell to be preserved, it\nmust only survive breakage and abrasion before burial and chemical dissolution of\nits constituent mineral material before and after deposition. Even if the object is\ndissolved after deposition, it is likely to be represented by a cavity, which serves\nthe paleontologist almost as well as the entire preserved object. Except in the\nyoungest sedimentary rocks, imprints of the shells of marine invertebrates are just\nas common as the shells themselves, and usually even more so.\n\n3.3 Fossiliferous Rocks\n\n3.3.1 A rock that contains fossils is said to be fossiliferous (in contrast to\nunfossiliferous--or, perhaps better, nonfossiliferous). Almost all fossils are\ncontained in sedimentary rocks. Not all sedimentary rocks, however, contain\nfossils. If they parachuted you out of an airplane to land on a random outcrop of\nsedimentary rock, the chance of your finding a fossil would be rather small--\nnowhere close to one hundred percent. Fossils are virtually nonexistent in igneous\nrocks, and they are extremely uncommon in metamorphic rocks, although certain\nrobust body fossils can survive a substantial degree of metamorphism. Finding a\nfossil in a metamorphic rock is a significant and exciting event for a geologist,\nbecause it is extremely difficult otherwise to date the time of deposition of the\nsedimentary precursors of now-metamorphosed rocks. More germane to this\nsection is that even slight low-grade metamorphism is effective at obliterating, or\nat least obscuring, the evidence of the small, vulnerable, single-celled organisms\nthat inhabited the early Earth.\n3.3.2 Some kinds of sedimentary rocks tend to be more fossiliferous than\nothers. Limestones are the generally the most fossiliferous of sedimentary rocks.\nThat should not be surprising, because most limestones consist in part, or even\nentirely, of the body parts of shelly marine organisms. Most coarse-grained\nlimestones, and many fine-grained limestones as well, consist mostly of whole\nshells or fragments of shells. Such fragments, although recognizably derived from\nwhole organisms, are not usually the subject of special study by paleontologists,\nbecause they are not sufficiently intact to carry detailed information about the\nnature of the organisms from which they were derived (although technically they\nare nevertheless fossils).\n3.3.3 In the Precambrian, cherts, together with limestones and shales, are the\nmajor repositories of the fossil evidence of early life. You can imagine a tiny,\nsoft-bodied unicellular organism, perhaps no more than several micrometers in\nsize, encased in soft, gelatinous, freshly precipitated amorphous silica from ocean\nwaters. Even if there is recrystallization of the chert, to a microcrystalline\n\naggregate of quartz crystals, there is a non-vanishing likelihood of at least partial\npreservation of the organism. The very oldest preserved fossils so far found are of\nthis kind; see a later section.\n3.3.4 Many shales, which are derived from freshly deposited mud, are\nfossiliferous as well, because certain organisms like to live on muddy sea floors.\nShales are often rich in trace fossils, but are less so in body fossils except when the\nchemical conditions during deposition were conducive to preservation rather than\ndecomposition. The best representatives of soft-bodied organisms are from shales,\nalthough, frustratingly for paleontologists, instances of such preservation are very\nuncommon. Many sandstones are fossiliferous as well, although the body fossils in\nsandstones are usually relatively robust shelly materials, which are not highly\nsusceptible to chemical decomposition. Conglomerates are the least fossiliferous\nof sedimentary rocks.\n\n4. THE EARLIEST FOSSILS\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\n4.1.1 Before the middle of the twentieth century, the conventional wisdom\namong geologists (and paleontologists) was that there were no Precambrian\nfossils. I can remember that era well, when I was an undergraduate geology major\nin the late 1950s. My best friend, a fellow geology major, once confided to me,\nwhen we were students, that he would like to be the first geologist to find a\nPrecambrian fossil: what an advance in science that would be! In fact, however,\nit was during the 1950s that a few geologists and paleontologists began to discover\nPrecambrian fossils. It was the start of a great reorientation in geological thinking.\n4.1.2 There were good reasons why Precambrian fossils, now known to be\nplentiful in the Proterozoic and present, though still scarce, even as early as the\nearly Archean, were virtually unknown. Geological work and thought were\ndominated by the geoscience \"establishment\" in Western Europe and the United\nStates, where, basically just by geological accident, there was a major\nunconformity below the Lower Cambrian, and the rocks beneath the unconformity\nwere mainly crystalline basement rocks--an unlikely venue for fossils. Moreover,\nno one until the 1950s seemed to have thought to train the advanced microscopic\ntechniques of the time on unmetamorphosed or only mildly metamorphosed\nPrecambrian sedimentary rocks. When they finally did, they found some\nspectacularly interesting microfossils.\n4.1.3 For what it's worth, here's a personal recollection from a now very\nsenior geologist. Once, when I was a undergrad, I went to an evening talk at the\nHarvard geology department, given by a paleobotanist named Elso Barghoorn. He\nhad been working with a colleague on microscopic examination of a Proterozoic\nchert unit, in the Canadian Shield, named the Gunflint Formation, an interbedding\nof chert and volcanics about 2000 Ma old. Together, they discovered a rich fauna\n\nof microfossils, fossilized in the chert. (Apparently, their discovery wasn't just a\nmatter of serendipity: they reasoned that the most likely kind of rock in which to\nfind fossilized Precambrian microfossils would be an unmetamorphosed old\nchert.) It hit the audience like a bombshell. I remember clearly that one of the\naudience, the distinguished chairman of the MIT geology department, and a\npaleontologist himself, stood up at the end of the talk and opined that this was one\nof the most seminal moments in his professional career, a milestone in the\nadvancement of geological science.\n\n4.2 Archean Fossils\n\n4.2.1 The fossil record of life on Earth is now known to stretch all the way\nback to the early Archean. In recent decades there have been many reports of\nArchean fossils: by one count, as of 1992, 43 categories of supposed Archean\nfossils, from 30 sedimentary units, had been reported. Of these, almost all have at\none time or another been questioned as true fossils. That brings up the question:\nhow does one recognize a given fossil-like object in the sedimentary record as a\ngenuine fossil?\n4.2.2 In the case of more recent fossils, during the Phanerozoic, almost all\nfossils are to some extent at least similar to living descendants. Even when poorly\npreserved, such fossils are commonly recognized as true fossils. Added to this is\nthe \"complexity effect\": the more advanced and complex the body morphology of\nan organism, the more likely is a fossil representative recognized as organic, rather\nthan as some kind of inorganic feature.\n4.2.3 Various kinds of objects, with globular, tubular, or other fairly regular\nshapes, are known to be inorganic, produced by abiotic processes. Examples are\nmineralized bubble cavities, mineral dendrites (frond-like growths of mineral\ncrystals on fracture surfaces), and non-biogenic aggregates of fossil organic\nmatter. When a geometrically simple fossil-like feature is found in very old\nPrecambrian rocks, particularly when it is not obviously related to some\npreviously authenticated early fossil, there is a natural skepticism about whether it\nis really biotic rather than the product of some abiotic process. Added to that are\nproblems associated with contamination by modern unicellular organisms during\nsample preparation.\n4.2.3 Scarcity of early Archean fossils is understandable, even if it is\nassumed that potentially fossilizable life existed at that time. Probably you have\nalready learned, in some previous course, that the early Archean continents were\nsmall nuclei, without broad and tectonically stable cratonal areas. There are not\nmany sedimentary successions in which to search for fossils in the first place, and\nmost of them have suffered some degree of metamorphism since deposition.\n4.2.4 The most promising targets for the search for Archean fossils have\nbeen in the Archean terranes of southern Africa and western Australia. A\n\nparticularly promising find was made in the Early Archean Warrawoona Group, in\nwestern Australia, in the late 1980s. That part of the Warrawoona Group is dated\nwith confidence at 3540 ± 0.030 Ma. At one particular locality, four taxa of\nfilamentous microfossils were found in a chert layer. The problem is that when\nthe original discoverer and others went back to find the locality, they couldn't find\nit again! In a situation like this, relocation is important for authentication:\n\nClearly, this is a tantalizing set of observations, one suggesting that it\nmust be very probable that cellularly preserved evidence of Early\nArchean life exists in Warrawoona Group sediments. Just as clearly,\nhowever, the available data fall short of providing the critical \"hard-\nnosed\" proof that properly should be demanded of discoveries of this\nsort, discoveries that alter generalizations (in this case, regarding the\noldest unequivocal evidence of life on earth) and, thus, become\nincorporated in college textbooks and even in common parlance. The\nharsh reality is that because this discovery has not been reconfirmed,\nthe results of this study, despite their presumed validity, are of limited\nvalue.\" (Schopf, 1992, p. 28.)\n\n4.2.5 Never fear. The author of that guardedly skeptical evaluation himself\ndiscovered similar fossils in that same Warrawoona Group later (albeit before he\nwrote the above quotation!). Just to demonstrate relocatability, a person described\nas a \"fledgling graduate student, who had not previously visited the outcrop and\nwas armed solely with maps, notes, and field photographs from the previous ...\ncollecting trip\" (Schopf, 1992, p. 29) was able to relocate the locality and collect\nmore material. Below is a brief account of these extremely significant fossils: the\noldest undoubted fossils known.\n4.2.6 The Warrawoona fossils (Figure 9-4; Schopf, J. W., 1992,\nPaleobiology of the Archean, in Schopf, J.W., and Klein, C, eds., The Proterozoic\nBiosphere; A Multidisciplinary Study: Cambridge University Press, 1348 p.\nFigure 1.5.6, p. 34) are described as filamentous, very dark brown to black\nkerogenous microfossils (kerogenous meaning that they contain kerogen, a general\nterm for decomposition-resistant residual biogenic organic matter in a sedimentary\nrock). They are composed of well-defined barrel-shaped or discoidal cells,\narranged in the form of a long filament, and the terminal cells of the filament are\nrounded or conical. The lengths of the filaments are some tens of micrometers\nlong, and the individual cells are of the order of a few micrometers in size. These\nseem to be colonial organisms, with each cell representing an individual\nunicellular organism. In a few cases there is even evidence of cell division in\nprogress, in the form of partial septa within an unusually long cell. Such\nmicrofossils are called trichomes, the general term for chains of filamentous\nbacteria or algae.\n\n4.2.7 That the fossils are indigenous to the deposit is not an issue here,\nbecause the fossils are found within small chert clasts, of sand size, in an enclosing\nlayer of chert. The interpretation is that the chert grains were derived from an\neven older chert unit and transported mechanically to the site of deposition of the\nenclosing chert.\n4.2.8 What are the phylogenetic affinities of these microfossils? (In plainer\nEnglish, which known organisms, if any, are they closely related to?) They are\nvery similar in morphology to Proterozoic and modern cyanobacteria. One of the\nbig questions about these oldest known organisms is whether they were oxygenic\nautotrophs or anoxygenic autotrophs. Given that modern cyanobacteria are\nuniversally oxygenic photoautotrophs, that's strong but not definitive evidence\nthat these Archean cyanobacteria-like microfossils produced oxygen as well.\nWe'll never know for sure, of course.\n4.2.9 One of the uncertainties about early fossils that look much like much\nyounger fossils, or like modern (\"extant\") organisms is what the specialists\nwhimsically called the \"Volkswagen effect\": A similar exterior morphology, but,\nhidden inside, substantial improvements in mechanisms and function.\n4.2.10 How about other Archean fossils? Does it seem depressing to you to\nlearn that there are only a few other undoubted examples? Slightly younger\nmicrofossils similar to those described above, although not as clearly preserved,\nare also known from cherts of a unit of chert known as the Onverwacht Group, in\nsouthern Africa, dated at 3.540 ± 0.030 Ma, and from younger cherty carbonates\n(2.768 ± 0.014 Ma) from another unit in western Australia. There are several\nreported microfossils that are currently considered \"dubiofossils\" (is that term\nsufficiently self-explanatory?); some of these are probably also fossils. It seems\nreasonable to conclude that, as the search for Archean fossils continues, more\nundoubted cases will be discovered--but probably never more than a handful.\n4.2.11 In addition to the Archean fossils described or mentioned above,\nwhich are true body fossils, several examples of Archean stromatolites are known.\nModern stromatolites are thought to be, at least in part, sedimentary features built\nby microorganisms, and if that is true of the Archean examples, then that adds to\nthe short list of Archean fossils. The problem is that the fossil nature of ancient\nstromatolites is inferential. The following section tells much more about\nstromatolites.\n\n\"Stromatolites are organogenic, laminated calcareous rock structure, the\norigin of which is clearly related to microscopic life, which in itself must\nnot be fossilized\" (the original definition; Kalkowsky, 1908, translated\nfrom the original German)\n\"Stromatolites are organosedimentary structures produced by sediment\ntrapping, binding, and/or precipitation as a result of growth and metabolic\nactivity of micro-organisms, principally cyanophytes\" (Walter, 1976)\n\"A stromatolite is an attached, laminated, lithified sedimentary growth\nstructure, accretionary away from a point or limited surface of initiation\"\n(Semikhatov et al., 1979)\n\nMake careful note that the first two definitions are genetic and the third is purely\ndescriptive.\n4.3.2 Stromatolites are distinctive sedimentary features that are present in\nrocks as old as Archean. They can be observed forming in subaqueous\nenvironments today. Their origin, their significance for paleoenvironmental\ninterpretation, and their significance for the evolution of life through geologic time\nhas been controversial for a hundred years, and continues to be.\n4.3.3 The principal features of morphology of stromatolites are easy to\ndescribe, in a general way at least. Stromatolites range widely in shape, from\ndomes and cones with rather regular shape, to fairly regular individual cylinders,\nto irregularly branched columns. The basic motif is that they grew upward from a\nnumber of points or small areas to form an array of convex-upward features of\npositive relief, separated by low areas. Figure 9-5 (Walter, M.R., Grotzinger, J.P.,\nand Schopf, J.W., 1992, Proterozoic stromatolites, in Schopf, J.W., and Klein, C,\neds., The Proterozoic Biosphere; A Multidisciplinary Study: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1348 p. (Figure 6.2.1, p. 254)) should give you an idea of\nthe morphological diversity of stromatolites. (Figure 9-5 contains much more\nmorphological information than we can deal with here; it's intended only to give\nyou the \"flavor\" of stromatolite morphology.) The morphological elements of\nstromatolites range in size from smaller than a decimeter to many tens of meters.\nStromatolites are characteristically laminated, typically on a submillimeter to\nmillimeter scale.\n\n4.3.4 The earliest students of stromatolites believed them to be actual\norganisms, and they gave the various shape categories of stromatolites names in\nthe same way that all organisms, fossil and modern, are given binomial names\naccording to the formal Linnaean naming system. It is now universally\nrecognized, however, that stromatolites are not individual organisms.\n\n4.3 Stromatolites\n\n4.3.1 Here are three partly conflicting definitions of stromatolites:\n\n4.3.5 The great debate about stromatolites centers around the role of\nmicrobial mats in the growth of stromatolites. The classical view is that\nstromatolites grow by trapping and binding of fine sediment by a microbial mat at\nthe water-sediment interface. The mat consists of slimy green masses of\ncyanobacteria or algae, which thrive by photosynthesis in shallow waters. Influxes\nof fine suspended sediment, carried by waves and currents during episodes of\nstrong water motions, cover the mat. The microbes then grow upward to\nregenerate the surface of the mat. In the process, after the organic matter of the\nburied mat is degraded, a lamina of carbonate sediment remains. Such a process\ncan be observed happening today, in just a few places where stromatolites exist.\n4.3.6 The problem with this classical interpretation is that what remains, in\nancient stromatolites, is the carbonate sediment: most or even all of the organic\nmatter that was putatively involved in the growth of the stromatolites has long\nsince been degraded. Moreover, the texture of the fine carbonate sediment itself\nhas been changed far-reachingly by later diagenesis. In many cases, microbial\nfossils are found in association with stromatolites--but that does not, in itself,\ndemonstrate that the stromatolite involved microbial mats: the microbes may just\nhave been non-essential occupants of an abiotically growing stromatolite. It's\nbeen estimated that less than one percent of all stromatolites ever described have\nmicrofossils associated with them.\n4.3.7 Stromatolites are known from as early as the Archean, although their\nearliest record is scanty (Figure 9-6). They are extremely abundant in the\nProterozoic--they are one of the most striking and characteristics aspect of that\ntime in Earth history--although their abundance began to decline around 1000\nMa, slowly at first and then catastrophically around the end of the Proterozoic.\nThe most natural way to explain the decline is the emergence of organisms that\neither competed with stromatolites for space on the shallow sea floor (seaweeds\ndeveloped around the same time) or grazed on the microbial mats (gastropods,\na.k.a. snails, which emerged near the beginning of the Phanerozoic, or perhaps\npoorly fossilized soft-bodied earlier metazoans, which emerged near the end of the\nProterozoic).\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n4.3.8 Where does this leave us? I don't know. Just because modern\nstromatolites involve trapping and binding by microbial mats doesn't\nautomatically mean that ancient stromatolites developed in just the same way,\nalthough that's the reigning paradigm. On the other hand, it's widely believed that\nmost, if not all, ancient stromatolites give evidence of the existence of microbial\nbiota. Does the clear evolution of the nature of stromatolites reflect evolutionary\nchanges in microbial populations, or gradual changes in such nonbiotic (or only\nindirectly biotic) things as ocean chemistry? That's still an unresolved question.\n4.3.9 Now to get back to Proterozoic microfossils. The record of body\nfossils of microbes is far more abundant in the Proterozoic than in the Archean.\n\n5. THE FOSSIL RECORD OF PROTEROZOIC PROKARYOTES\n\n5.1 The fossil record of Proterozoic prokaryotes is very abundant, relative to\nthat of the Archean: about three hundred species have been recognized, from a\nlarge number of localities. They are found in both shales and cherts. The fossil\nrecord of these prokaryotes becomes abundant and widespread by about 2100 Ma.\nThe great majority of these fossil organisms \"are of cyanobacterial affinity\"\n(meaning that they look like modern cyanobacteria, in a general way). In\nparticular, a lot of them look like a particular group of modern cyanobacteria\ncalled chroococcaleans, which come in ellipsoidal to coccoidal (i.e., spheroidal)\nshapes, and are both solitary and colonial; others look like a modern group called\n\nFigure 9-6: The distribution of known Archean stromatolite localities\nT\nhe d\nistributio\nn of known Archean stromatolite\nlo\nc\na li\nt\ni\ne\ns\n.\n\nnostocaleans, which are colonial in long, filamentous chains. Figure 9-7; Schopf,\nJ.W., 1992, Proterozoic prokaryotes: affinities, geologic distribution, and\nevolutionary trends, in Schopf, J.W., and Klein, C, eds., The Proterozoic\nBiosphere; A Multidisciplinary Study: Cambridge University Press, 1348 p. A)\nFigure 5.4.1, p. 195; B) Figure 5.4.2, p. 196, shows some representative modern\ncyanobacteria. (No scale was given in the original figures, but I think that these\nfeatures are of the order of ten micrometers to a few tens of micrometers in size.)\n5.2 Just to calibrate you, slightly, to the nature of these Proterozoic\ncyanobacteria-like fossils, here are a few comments about modern cyanobacteria.\nModern cyanobacteria are unicellular oxygenic photoautotrophs (i.e., they are\nphotosynthesizing plants, with chlorophyll, that produce oxygen during\nphotosynthesis). (Incidentally, cyanobacteria used to be called blue-green algae,\nbut they are not true algae. Algae are eukaryotic plants, only very distantly related\nto cyanobacteria; see Figure 9-2.) They resemble bacteria, but they differ in that\nbacteria are not photosynthesizers. (If you go back to Figure 9-2, you can see that\nboth bacteria and cyanobacteria belong to the domain of Bacteria, so they are\nrelatively closely related.) Most are colonial, forming long filaments. They are\nextremely widespread in their distribution: they are found in hot springs, soils,\nfreshwater bodies, and the oceans.\n5.3 Not all Proterozoic prokaryotes are cyanobacteria-like. A small\nminority of them are more like modern bacteria, and some are classed as\n\"problematica\" (meaning that paleontologists don't know what to do with them).\nWhatever their taxonomic affinities, however, it seems clear that they underwent\nvery little morphological evolution over extremely long periods of geologic time.\nIt's possible that their internal anatomy and physiology advanced more than their\nexternal morphology during that long time (the \"Volkswagen effect\" mentioned\nabove): there is absolutely no fossil evidence of their innards. Given the relative\nsimplicity of the internal anatomy and physiology of modern cyanobacteria,\nhowever, that seems unlikely. This matter has relevance to the important question\nof whether these Proterozoic prokaryotes engaged in oxygenic photosynthesis.\nThere is, of course, no direct evidence of that, but there is good circumstantial\nevidence: the atmosphere became oxygenated in the course of the Proterozoic,\nand if these prokaryotes were the dominant organisms until late in the Proterozoic,\nit's reasonable to assume that they were photosynthesizers. Or were other\norganisms, which never became fossilized, responsible for the oxygenation?\nThere's a lesson in all of this: you can see how speculative much of the thought\nabout the Precambrian has to be.\n\n5.4 One of the major geological uses of fossils in the Phanerozoic is time\ncorrelation of strata from region to region of the Earth; more on that later, when\nwe deal with the Phanerozoic. (Another of the major geological uses of fossils is\nin the interpretation of paleoenvironments--an entirely separate matter.) What's\nclear from the Proterozoic record of prokaryotes is that they are virtually useless\nfor correlation.\n\nPART II. NEOPROTEROZOIC LIFE\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 The Neoproterozoic, from 1000 Ma to the beginning of the Cambrian, at\n543 Ma, was indeed an exciting time. It saw the rise of organisms with eukaryotic\ncells, structurally and metabolically advanced, relative to organisms with\nprokaryotic cells (which had been around for well over two billion years!). It saw\nthe assembly and then breakup and dispersal of the supercontinent of Rodinia.\n1.2 In the course of the Neoproterozoic there were two major intervals of\ncontinental glaciation. The latter of which was clearly the most extensive\nglaciation in Earth history. There is good evidence of the existence of extensive\nglaciers even at low latitudes, and some believe that the Earth at that time was a\n\"frozen ball\", described as the snowball Earth.\n1.3 In conjunction with these changes in climate there were great changes in\ngeochemical signatures, most prominently of carbon, leading, for the first time, to\nthe possibility of doing what is called chemostratigraphy (making correlations of\nstrata and stratigraphic units from region to region on the basis of their\ngeochemical signatures). Study of the variations in such geochemical signatures\nthrough time is, of course, valuable in itself, because of the insight it can provide\ninto the overall Earth environment.\n1.4 Near the end of the Proterozoic, there appeared on the scene a\nfascinating biota of large, well preserved organisms, all of them soft-bodied rather\nthan with biomineralized skeletons, called the Ediacaran biota. Were they the\nprecursors of the various phyla of invertebrate animals that exploded near the\nbeginning of the Cambrian, or were they a distinctive and unrelated set of\norganisms? The matter is not settled.\n\n2. THE RISE OF THE EUKARYOTES\n\n2.1 Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes\n\n2.1.1 The appearance of organisms with eukaryotic cells was a major\nadvance in evolution. Eukaryotic cells are much larger than prokaryotic cells, and\nthey are more advanced in structure and physiology. Perhaps the most striking\ndifference between the two kinds of cells (see background section below for more\ndetail than is included in this paragraph) is that in the eukaryotic cell the genetic\nmaterial is contained within a cell nucleus, a structure contained within the\ncytoplasm (the term used for the fluid content of the cell) but isolated from it by its\nown wall. In prokaryotes, on the other hand, the genetic material is dispersed\nwithin the cytoplasm. Moreover, eukaryotic cells contain a variety of special\nstructures and bodies called organelles. (The nucleus itself is one such organelle.)\nThe most characteristic of such organelles, besides the nucleus, are mitochondria,\nin which much of the metabolic activity of cell is carried out, and, in the case of\nplants, chloroplasts, in which photosynthesis occurs.\n\nBACKGROUND: PROKARYOTIC AND EUKARYOTIC CELLS\n\n1. There are great differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.\nWithin each kind, of course, there is considerable variety of structure and\nbiochemistry, but a number of fundamental differences reflect the accepted idea\nthat eukaryotic cells are a late (in the context of geologic time, that is)\nevolutionary advance over prokaryotic cells. don't interpret that to mean that\neukaryotic cells are more successful than eukaryotic ells, though: prokaryotic\norganisms are highly successful in their diverse ecological niches--swarming all\nover us and within us throughout our lives!\n2. Prokaryotic cells are both smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells. The\ntypical size range of prokaryotic cells is 0.2 to 2 μm (micrometers, or microns) in\ndiameter, whereas eukaryotic cells are much larger, typically 10-100 μm in\ndiameter. All cells, of course, have a cell wall or membrane of some kind, in order\nto isolate the contents of the cell from the outer world. Cell walls vary greatly in\ntheir composition and structure. Prokaryotic cells actually are more complicated\nthan eukaryotic cells. They consist of a chemically complex macromolecular\nnetwork, and they are semi-rigid.\n3. Both kinds of cell are filled with a material called the cytoplasm. It is the\ninternal matrix of the cell, in which all of the other internal constituents are\nembedded. It consists mostly of water but contains proteins, carbohydrates, lipids,\ninorganic ions, and various low-molecular-weight organic molecules. In\neukaryotic cells, in contrast to prokaryotic cells, the cytoplasm is characterized by\n\na complex internal structure that consists of an assemblage of very small rods and\ntubules which together constitute what is called the cytoskeleton.\n4. The fundamental differences between the two kinds of cells lie most\ndistinctively in internal composition and structure. Eukaryotic cells contain\nseveral kinds of specialized structures called organelles. The most characteristic\neukaryotic organelle is, of course, the nucleus, which contains the genetic\ninformation of the cell. In prokaryotic cells, the genetic material is distributed\nthroughout the cytoplasm rather than being encapsulated in the nucleus.\n5. Among several other kinds of eukaryotic organelles, two of the\ncharacteristic are mitochondria and chloroplasts. Mitochondria are spherical or\nrod-shaped bodies distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Much of the metabolic\nactivity of the cell occurs in the mitochondria, including synthesis of ATP\n(adenosine triphosphate), the compound that powers metabolic processes.\nChloroplasts, contained in the photosynthesizing eukaryotes (algae and plants) are\nmembrane-bounded bodies that contain the chlorophyll and the enzymes that are\nrequired for photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are able to multiply on their own within\nthe cell, by increasing in size and then dividing into two. (There's a theory, rather\ngenerally accepted nowadays, that chloroplasts were once symbiotic\nphotoautotrophic prokaryotes that eventually became an actual internal part of the\nhost cell!)\n\n2.2 How are Eukaryotes Recognized in the Fossil Record?\n\n2.2.1 There has been a longstanding problem--which continues today--\nabout when eukaryotic cells first evolved. The problem is that the interior content\nof the cells of organisms are extremely evanescent, and are not preserved in\nfossils. How, then, are we to tell whether a given Precambrian unicellular\norganism was a prokaryote or a eukaryote? One basis is size: eukaryotic cells are\ntypically much larger than prokaryotic cells. The problem is that this is not\ndefinitive, because there is an overlap in the two size ranges. In the view of most\npaleontologists, this problem is always going to be with us.\n2.2.2 The problem is not quite as hopeless as it seems, however., inasmuch\nas the details of composition of the cell walls of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is\nsignificantly different. The cell membranes of eukaryotes contain a class of\ncompounds called sterols, which are complex lipids (a term used in organic\nchemistry for a wide variety of fats, oils, and waxes) not found in the cell\nmembranes of the prokaryotes. Under the right conditions of preservation (that is,\nno more than moderate diagenesis, and no metamorphism) the sterols can survive\n(as what were called organic fossils or biomarkers in the preceding chapter).\n\nThat's taken as excellent evidence that the cells in question are eukaryotic. The\nproblem, however, is that such evidence is regrettably scanty.\n\n2.3 The First Eukaryotes\n\n2.3.1 Remember the business about how molecular biologists can trace the\ndeep evolutionary roots of the present biological world by the techniques of\nmolecular phylogeny--by examining changes in RNA and DNA sequencing that\nare thought to have been occurring at an approximately constant tempo through\ngeologic time? By this line of investigation, the Eucarya first diverged from the\nArchaea far back in geologic time. Also, the presence of organic compounds\nknown to be derived from sterols in rocks as old as 2700 Ma place a minimum age\non this evolutionary split. (Remember that sterols are characteristic of eukaryotic\ncells but not of prokaryotic cells.) The generally agreed-upon conclusion from\nsuch studies is that the eukaryotes diverged from the prokayotes very early in\ngeologic history, as far back as 2700 Ma. The problem is that such a hypothesis\n(or should we call it a speculation?) cannot be substantiated by the fossil record.\n2.3.2 The oldest fossils that can with some confidence be considered\neukarotic are the earliest acritarchs (Figure 9-8; Vidal, G., 1994, Early ecosystems:\nLimitations imposed by the fossil record, in Bengtson, S., ed., Early Life on Earth;\nNobel Symposium No. 84: Columbia University Press, 630 p. (Figure 3, p. 307)).\nAcritarchs are organic-walled microfossils. They consist of a central cavity\nenclosed by a wall of single or multiple layers of mainly organic composition.\nThey have diameters from a few tens of micrometers to about two hundred\nmicrometers and a generally globular shape, with either smooth walls or spine-like\nprotuberances or more complex surface geometries (which paleontologists\ndescribe as ornamentation). Acritarchs consist of a tough, durable cell wall made\nup of various organic compounds. Paleontologists isolate acritarchs in large\nnumbers from Precambrian shales, by laboratory techniques of hydrofluoric acid\ndigestion of the inorganic part of the rock, leaving just the acritarchs!\n2.3.3 The phyletic affinities of acritarchs are not entirely clear. Some\nresemble the walls of living dinoflagellates, which are unicellular eukaryotic\nmarine plankton, especially abundant in warm seas. Most acritarchs, however, are\ninterpreted to be the remains of special coatings, called cysts, developed by algae\n(photoautotrophic unicellular eukaryotes) in the resting stage of their life cycle.\n2.3.4 Acritarch fossils are common from about 1000 Ma onwards, but they\nare known as far back as 1800-1900 Ma, from a special locality in China. These\nearliest acritarchs are similar in general morphology to undoubted later acritarchs,\nwhich date back to about 1400 Ma, but there is some residual doubt about whether\nthese fossils might instead be unusually large prokaryotic organisms.\n\n2.4 Evolution of the Eukaryotes\n\n2.4.1 The earliest evolution of the eukaryotes seems to have been very slow.\nDuring the course of the Mesoproterozoic (1600 to 1000 Ma), acritarchs became\nmore abundant and more diverse in their morphology. Also during this time, the\nfirst uncontroversially eukaryotic organisms made their appearance. Some of\nthese organisms seem to have been multicellular, but there's the common problem\nof telling apart the truly multicellular organisms from colonial single-celled\norganisms, without the benefit of seeing the organisms alive.\n2.4.2 The earliest eukaryote that can with confidence be assigned to an\nextant phylum is a red alga from arctic Canada, dated at 1260 to 950 Ma. It's\nnowadays clear to paleontologists that such fossil records are a clear indication\nthat complex multicellularity in the eukaryotes developed long before the end of\nthe Proterozoic.\n2.4.3 During the Neoproterozoic, the diversity of eukaryotes, both\nunicellular (in the form mainly of acritarchs) and multicellular (mainly in the form\nof algae) became even more abundant. There's a rich record of such organisms\nfrom a number of localities around the world. Such a significant evolutionary\nincrease in diversity of organisms is known in paleontology as a radiation.)\n\n2.5 The Ediacaran Biota\n\n2.5.1 A fascinating and still mysterious assemblage of large organisms,\ncalled the Ediacaran biota, made their appearance in the latter part of the\nProterozoic and survived until almost the end of the Proterozoic (in round\nnumbers, they spanned the time interval from 600 Ma to 550 Ma). They have\nbeen known for over fifty years, and finds at widely separated localities around the\nworld continue to be made. These are the first large organisms known. In part,\ntheir diverse body plans have some resemblances to certain of the metazoan phyla\nthat made their appearance near the start of the Phanerozoic, but there is\ncontinuing controversy over the extent to which these interesting organisms are\nthe precursors of the Phanerozoic invertebrates. As an outsider to the field, the\nbest adjective I can think of to characterize the Ediacarans is spectacular.\n2.5.2 Back in the 1940s, a survey geologist named Sprigg, working for the\ngeological survey in the Australian state of South Australia, while reconnoitering a\nmining property found a suite of distinctive fossils in a Neoproterozoic unit called\nthe Pound Quartzite, exposed in an area called the Ediacara Hills. (This is the\nstory as I understand it.) He published a few papers about the biota, but it wasn't\nuntil a number of years passed, in the 1950s and 1960s, that the paleontological\nworld at large came to realize the great significance of Spriggs's discovery. The\nbiota he discovered, together with similar biotas in numerous localities of about\nthe same age around the world, have come to be known as the Ediacaran biota. (It\nhas generally been called the Ediacaran fauna, but it's not entirely certain that\n\nthese were even animals, rather than plantlike organisms--see below-- so it's\nbecome safer to refer to them by the more general term biota.)\n\nBACKGROUND: FAUNA, FLORAS, AND BIOTAS\n\n1. You've probably heard the terms flora and fauna. The term fauna is\nused to describe a particular collection of animals that lived in a given place at a\ngiven time. The corresponding term flora is used for an assemblage of plants.\nThere are singular nouns; the plural forms are faunas and floras. The more general\nterm, for plants and animals alive, are biota (singular) and biotas (plural).\n\n2.5.3 Ediacaran biotas have been found in the White Sea area of northern\nRussia, in Ukraine, in the Avalon terrane of southeastern Newfoundland, in\nEngland, in Namibia, and in certain other areas. Their distribution thus seems to\nbe worldwide (although keep in mind that the geography then was very different\nfrom now). Although dates are not entirely well constrained, the Ediacarans seem\nto have spanned a time interval from a bit older than 600 Ma to about 550 Ma, a\nbit before the official beginning of the Cambrian. Their large size and rather\ndiverse and complex body plans suggests, however, that they must have been\nevolving, in obscurity, for a long time before that. Or did they make a relatively\nsudden appearance, for evolutionary reasons we cannot know?\n2.5.4 A large number of different kinds of organisms are represented in the\nEdiacaran biota. What they all have in common is that they are fossils of soft-\nbodied organisms: no biomineralization, to produce hard skeletal materials, was\ninvolved. As should make good sense to you, soft-bodied organisms are\nnotoriously difficult to preserve--and yet this great variety of organisms managed\nsomehow to be extensively preserved. Moreover, they are preserved not in\nshales--the diagenetic product of soft muddy bottoms of the kind that have tended\nto lead to preservation of delicate soft-bodied organisms in more recent geologic\ntimes--but in sandstones! They appear as clear imprints on sandstone bedding\nplanes. Some even have an aspect of three-dimensional preservation. It's clear,\nfrom the sedimentological evidence of the enclosing deposits, that these organisms\nlived mostly in shallow ocean waters, where light was available.\n2.5.5 They say that a picture is worth a thousand words. Figure 9-9\n(McMenamin, M.A.S., 1998, The Garden of Ediacara; Discovering the First\nComplex Life: Columbia University Press, 295 p. (Figure 2.2, p. 15; Figure 2.8,\np. 22; Figure 2.11, p. 25 Figure 2.17, p. 31; Figure 2.18, p. 33; Figure 2.19, p. 35;\nFigure 2.20, p. 36; Figure 2.22, p. 38; Figure 2.27, p. 41) and figure 9-10\n\n(Seilacher, A., 1994, Early multicellular life: Late Proterozoic fossils and the\nCambrian explosion, in Bengtson, S., ed., Early Life on Earth; Nobel Symposium\nNo. 84: Columbia University Press, 630 p. Figure 1, p. 390) show a variety of\nEdiacaran fossils. Each kind has been named, in the standard binomial Linnaean\nsystem of genus and species, although there are long-standing controversies about\nhow to recognize species among the Ediacaran fossils. It's the old problem of\nlumpers vs. splitters. What is abundantly clear, however, is that there is a wide\nvariety of different kinds of organisms involved.\n2.5.6 The variety and complexity of the great many kinds of Ediacaran\nfossils recognized so far continually astonishes even hardened paleontologists. I\ncan't possibly do justice to that here. Let me just point out one of the most\ndistinctive and mysterious of them: Dickinsoniana (represented by four similar\nspecies). A picture and a sketch of Dickinsoniana are included in Figures 9-9 and\n9-10. Here, lifted from the literature, is a basic description, in conventional\npaleontologic terminology:\n\nDickinsoniana is oval in shape, broad and flat. It is bilaterally\nsymmetric, with a plane of symmetry bisecting the oval along its long\naxis. In some specimens there is a raised ridge running along the\nsymmetry line. Both halves of the creature are divided into tubular\npartitions that run approximately perpendicular to the plane of\nsymmetry at the point where they meet the midline. Moving away\nfrom the midline, the tubular partitions become wider and curve gently\ntoward the nearest end of the flat oval body. Adjacent tubular\npartitions are fused along their lateral edges for almost all of their\nlength. At one end of the oval the tubes are long and constitute\napproximately one-third of the length of the midline of organisms. At\nthe end opposite to this one, the tubular structures are much shorter.\nThere may be an inward indentation in the perimeter of the oval at this\nend. The end of the oval with shorter tubules is presumably the end at\nwhich new tubular partitions are added during growth. The margins of\nthe oval may show concentric wrinkling. (McMenamin, 1998, p. 33.)\n\n2.5.7 What is the basic nature of the Ediacaran biota? The organisms seem\nto have been not biomineralized, but yet with much more potential for\npreservation than the soft-bodied organisms, like jellyfish, with which we are\nfamiliar today. In general, they seem to have been large bag-like and sheet-like\norganisms, with highly diverse body plans but with certain common traits. Most\nspectacularly, perhaps, is that they apparently were both mouthless and gutless,\nand without respiratory organs!\n2.5.8 If they were so simple anatomically, how did they obtain their food\nand oxygen? That's a problem that has concerned the experts for a long time, and\ncontinues to do so. One idea is that they had such large surface area relative to\n\ntheir volume that they were able to obtain their oxygen by simple diffusion\nthrough their body surfaces, rather than needing to have more complicated\noxygen-gathering organs. Their shallow-water environment is consistent with this\nidea, and the sheetlike form of many of the Ediacaran species is suggestive of this.\nThey could have obtained nutrients by diffusion of free-floating organic\ncompounds in the waters in which they lived, rather than being filter feeders or\nmouthed scavengers, in the way that later metazoans obtained their food. They\nseem not to had any complex apparatus for gathering and digestion of food.\n2.5.9 One of the ideas about the Ediacaran organisms that has gained some\ncurrency in recent years is that they (or at least some of them) had a symbiotic\nrelationship with photoautotrophic microorganisms(single-celled plants), which\nwould have supplied the organism with oxygen. Such a phenomenon has been\ntermed photosymbiosis. But of course we don't really know.\n2.5.10 Many, if not most, of the Ediacarans seem to have been sessile--that\nis, living in one place rather than moving around--as opposed to vagile. Some\nmight have been firmly attached to the bottom. There is clear evidence that some\nincorporated sand into their interiors to aid in holding themselves down against\ncurrents. The phrase \"rock in a sock\", describes some of the bag-like but\nanchored forms quite well! Figure 9-11 shows one prominent paleontologist's\nconcept: the animal had an internal skeleton of cemented sand at the base of its\nbody to help anchor it to the substrate.\n\nSeilacher's concept.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure 9-11: Seilacher's concept of an Ediacaran fossil with an internal sand skeleton.\nThe diameter of the sand skeleton is 2 cm\n\ninvertebrate phyla that are so well known from the fossil record. Some\npaleontologists think they can recognize in the Ediacaran biota the precursors of\nseveral of the Phanerozoic phyla of metazoan invertebrates. Other paleontologists\nthink that the Ediacaran organisms have no descendants. In the later view, they\nbecame extinct without giving rise to the later life forms. There are at least\nsuperficial similarities, especially to arthropods (the trilobites, which lived in great\nprofusion on and near the sea floor during much of the Paleozoic, were\narthropods), cnidarians (represented today by such beings as sea anemones and\njellyfish) echinoderms, and worms, but such similarities by no means prove\nrelationship. One problem in making such connections is that paleontologists\nhave be careful that they not let their so-called \"search image\" color their\ninterpretations of what might be similar but completely unrelated beings!\n2.5.12 There is even a hypothesis out there that the Ediacaran organisms\nwere very large unicellular organisms! There's no way of proving or disproving\nthat, because the cells (cell?) are not preserved. Certain modern animals, called\nxenophytophores, live on the deep sea floor. They are giant unicellular organisms\nthat form a skeleton of agglutinated sediment particles. Their feeding strategy\nseems to involve both digestion of organic matter in sediment and direct\nabsorption of nutrients from the seawater. Maybe at least some of the Ediacarans\nwere similarly unicellular.\n2.5.13 One prominent student of the Ediacaran biota has proposed that the\nEdiacaran organisms lived in a setting without predators. We are used to the idea\nthat, in the modern world, there are predators and there are prey. That might not\nhave been so at the time of the Ediacaran biota. Perhaps they existed in what has\nbeen picturesquely called the \"Garden of Ediacara\"--a world in which these large\nand rather advance organisms lived without fear of being eaten! In this view, with\nthe advent of the precursors of the Phanerozoic invertebrates the defenseless\nEdiacarans slowly became extinct. There is some supporting evidence for this\nhypothesis. The Ediacarans show little evidence of predator damage, like missing\npieces or healed wounds. By Cambrian time, however, such evidence of predation\nis clear. Maybe the world really did change.\n2.5.14 There is little, if any, overlap in the fossil record between the\nEdiacarans and the later invertebrates that are so characteristic of Cambrian and\nlater times. In terms of trace fossils, however, late in the Ediacaran interval there\nwas a growing abundance of traces, presumably made by non-preservable soft-\nbodied creeping and burrowing organisms. As time went on, the trace-making\norganisms seem to have become more and more adept at living and feeding below\nthe water-sediment interface, which is good evidence that they had developed\nstrategies and physiology for much better locomotion on and in the sediment.\nMaybe these trace-makers were the precursors to the Phanerozoic metazoans we\nknow so well. If so, those poor brainless Ediacaran bags and sheets must have had\n\n2.5.11 An enduring controversy, not yet settled to general satisfaction, is\nwhether any of the Ediacaran forms are the predecessors of the later Cambrian\n\nno inkling that the small, evanescent trace-makers at their feet (more precisely,\ntheir anchoring devices) would eventually spell their doom!\n2.5.15 The organisms that constitute the Ediacaran biota lived for some tens\nof millions of years. By that measure, and in terms of their diverse and complex\nbody plans, together with their worldwide distribution, they can be counted an\nevolutionary success, even though they eventually became extinct, for whatever\nreason.\n\nPART III. THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 If you go fossil hunting in Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks, in most\nplaces you don't have to go very far to find fossiliferous rocks. If, on the other\nhand, you try to find fossils in Precambrian rocks, you are almost certain to be\ndoomed to failure. Geologists have known from early on that the obvious fossil\nrecord comes in abruptly at the beginning of the Phanerozoic: it's one of those\nfirst-order facts of geology. More accurately, however, it's a matter of the sudden\nappearance of fossil organisms with hard skeletal materials; such organisms are\nsaid to be biomineralizing. (You've learned already, in a previous section, that\nthere is a significant, albeit not at all obvious, Precambrian fossil record.) This\nchapter attempts to look more closely at the nature of that change in the fossil\nrecord.\n1.2 In the previous section you heard about the Ediacaran biotas, which\nexisted for some tens of millions of years near the end of the Neoproterozoic. The\nrelationship between the Ediacaran beings and the later metazoans continues to be\ncontroversial. The consensus seems to be that some, or a few (or should I say only\na few?) of the Ediacarans are genuinely the ancestors of later metazoans. The\nappearance of the metazoan phyla we know from the Phanerozoic was a\nspectacular event in Earth history: it was one of the significant milestones in the\nhistory of life, and it happened over an astonishingly short period of geologic time.\nIt's been called the Cambrian radiation (in the biological context, a radiation is a\ndevelopment of many new life forms by rapid evolution from one or a few\nprecursors during some relatively brief period of geologic time) or the Cambrian\nexplosion. The term \"explosion\" is, of course, hyperbole (did any other explosion\nyou know of take ten to twenty million years?), but it's seen as appropriate\nbecause the event happened in such a short period of time.\n\n2.1 Since the time of the ancient Greeks, scientists have been trying to\nclassify living beings according to some rational and systematic scheme. The\nmodern system of classification, in which each kind of living being is assigned a\ngenus name and a species name (we are genus Homo and species sapiens) got its\nstart with Linnaeus (1707-1778; his real, Swedish, name was Karl Linne).\nLinnaeus spent much of his long life going around and giving things genus and\nspecies name--in other words, classifying living things. Eventually the same\nprocedure was adopted for fossils as well.\n2.2 There has been a feeling on the part of certain scientists that only fields\nlike physics are \"real science\", and everything else is \"just stamp collecting\". In\nthat view, classifying living things is just stamp collecting. In fact, however,\nclassification of living things gets right to the heart of the history of life on Earth.\nIn the field of biology, classifying living things according to an accepted\nhierarchical scheme is called systematics.\n2.3 Up until the middle of the twentieth century, it was generally considered\nthat all living things fell into one or two kingdoms: animals, and plants. Even as\nfar back as the nineteenth century, however, there were biologists who were not\ncomfortable with that neat two-part division, and proposed three-kingdom or four-\nkingdom divisions, to take account of such things as fungi, yeasts, and bacteria,\nwhich don't fit very neatly as either plants or animals. You've seen that\nnowadays, with the advent of molecular phylogenetics or molecular systematics,\nmentioned in an earlier chapter, it has become natural to think in terms of three\ndomains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.\n2.4 An alternative way of classifying all life, past and present, which is\nbased on all aspects of the biology of the beings, and not just molecular\nphylogenetics, divides all of life into two great domains, the Prokarya and the\nEukarya, with the Eukarya in turn divided into five kingdoms: Protoctista (algae,\nprotozoa, slime molds, and certain other kinds of organisms), Animalia (animals\nwithout backbones, called invertebrates, and animals, like us, with backbones,\ncalled vertebrates), Fungi (mushrooms, molds, and yeasts), and Plantae (mosses,\nferns, and other spore-bearing or seed-bearing plants). (In this classification, the\ndomain of the Prokarya contains only one kingdom, the Bacteria, which in turn is\ndivided into two subkingdoms, the Archaea and the Eubacteria).\n2.5 These alternative classifications are not the final word: there are other\nvariants out there, and the scene will certainly change, at least in minor ways, as\nmore and more of the details of life are studied, and as the fossil record is\nuncovered in more and more detail.\n\n2.6 In this section we will be concerned with the Animalia, and in\nparticular, the early development of the Animalia. If the foregoing material on\nclassification of life seems a bit overwhelming to you, here's some more for you\n\n2. CLASSIFYING LIVING ORGANISMS\n\nto absorb: how to classify the animals. One way of doing it is to follow the\nstandard taxonomic scheme for all living things. (Taxonomy is the analysis of the\ncharacteristics of a given organism for the purpose of assigning that organism to\na taxon, a taxon being a particular group of organisms that are related in some\nway or to some degree.) Taxa are arranged according to a hierarchy with several\nlevels, ranging from the broadest and most general (domain, then kingdom) down\nto the narrowest and most specific (the species, which is usually defined as a\npopulation of organisms that are able to interbreed to produce fertile offspring--\nalthough that definition is less natural for prokaryotes than for eukaryotes).\n2.7 Here's the conventional taxonomic hierarchy:\n\ndomain\nkingdom\n\nphylum\n\nclass\n\norder\n\nfamily\n\ngenus\n\nspecies\n\nComments:\n\n- Each of these can be modified by the prefix super- or sub- to create even\nmore levels in the hierarchy, if the need is felt to arise for a given group of\norganisms!\n- The phylum occupies a somewhat special place in the hierarchy. A\nphylum is a group of organisms whose ancestors became distinctive, by evolution\nfrom some even earlier common ancestor, at an early time in Earth history. There\ncontinue to be differences of opinion, on the part of the classifying experts, on\nwhich phylum certain organisms belong to, and even about how many phyla there\nare! Many phyla are represented by only a few kinds of organisms, and some\nphyla are represented by only extinct species. By one standard classification, there\nare thirty-seven phyla of animals, only several of which are well represented in the\nfossil record.\n\n- The only organisms for which we can study physiology as well as\nanatomy, and, very importantly, reproductive and developmental biology, are\nliving organisms: almost without exception, all we can study about fossil\norganisms is morphology, and mostly external morphology at that. Traditionally,\n\nthe \"taxonomic affinities\" (that is, how the species should be classified in the\ntaxonomic hierarchy) comes down to educated guesses about evolutionary\nlineages. For only a surprisingly few fossil species can a clear evolutionary\nlineage be traced--largely because of the inevitable gaps in the fossil record. In\nrecent years, however, molecular phylogenetics has added enormously to\nbiologists' understanding of the evolutionary history of major groups of\norganisms.\n- Paleontologists (and neobiologists as well) strive to make their\nclassification of species into higher taxa natural, but the true, right answer is never\nreally at hand; it's a matter of judgment on the part of the practitioners. The only\nnatural basis for recognition of these so-called higher taxa is evolutionary\nlineages. And how is one to know how evolution actually proceeded? We have\nno time-lapse movies to tell the tale. This is a fundamental problem not only for\npaleontologists, who never see their species in the living state, but also for\nneobiologists, who although they have living species to deal with, are still in the\nsame boat as the paleontologists because they are lacking the dimension of past\ntime.\n\n2.8 There are a few more things you need to hear about before we deal with\nthe early evolution of animals. The kingdom Animalia has been subdivided into\ntwo subkingdoms: Subkingdom Parazoa (organisms that lack tissues organized\ninto organs and that mostly have an indeterminate form) and Subkingdom\nEumetazoa (true metazoans, with tissues organized into organs and systems of\norgans). There are also a few kinds of organisms that do not fall naturally into\neither of these subkingdoms! The Subkingdom Parazoa contains only two phyla:\nPlacazoa (only one genus!) and Porifera (commonly known as sponges, which\nhave been an important component of the world of animals since the initial\nappearance of animals). Subkingdom Eumetazoa, on the other hand, contains\nthirty-three phyla.\n2.9 The Eumetazoa, in turn, comprise two branches: radially symmetrical\norganisms (the Radiata) and bilaterally symmetrical organisms (the Bilateria).\nMost metazoans (including us!) are bilaterally symmetrical. The Radiata comprise\nonly two phyla: Cnidaria (9400 species, including sea anemones, jellyfish, hydras,\nand corals), and Ctenophora (comb jellies, a different kind of jellyfish).\n2.10 Figure 9-12 (Margulis, L., and Schwartz, K.V., 1998, Five Kingdoms;\nAn Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth, Third Edition: W.H. Freeman,\nOwl Books, 520 p. (p. 204)) taken from the magnificent book by Margulis and\nSchwartz on the five kingdoms of life, is the best I've ever found on the nature and\nphylogenetic relationships of all of the animal phyla. I think it's true (but I'm not\nentirely certain) that all of these phyla have a fossil record of some kind, but what\nI am sure of is that the fossil record of most of them is very scanty--because they\nare represented entirely by soft-bodied (non-biomineralizing) organisms.\n\n2.11 Almost all of the fossils that are commonly found in Phanerozoic\nsedimentary rocks belong to the following phyla (in alphabetical order):\n\nBrachiopoda (brachiopods)\nBryozoa (bryozoans)\nEchinodermata (crinoids etc.)\nCnidaria (corals)\nMollusca (clams, snails, cephalopods)\nPorifera (sponges)\nTrilobites (classified either as extinct arthropods or as their own phylum).\n\n3. THE EMERGENCE OF THE METAZOANS\n\n3.1 The Earliest Metazoans\n\n3.1.1 Which are the earliest metazoans depends on how metazoans are\ndefined. Were the Ediacarans metazoans? There's a difference of opinion about\nthat, although the weight of opinion seems to be that, even among the Ediacaran\nspecies that seem not to have given rise to Phanerozoic descendants, they were\nmulticellular eukaryotes, and therefore metazoans. There is a minority opinion,\nthough, that the Ediacarans were very large unicellular organisms. Whatever is\nthe case, however, it seems clear that the Ediacaran fossil record disappears well\nbefore the rise of the various metazoan phyla, biomineralizing or not, in the\nCambrian. (That in itself seems to point toward a fundamental difference between\nthe Ediacarans, on the one hand, and the Phanerozoic metazoans, on the other\nhand.)\n\nBACKGROUND: THE GEOLOGIC TIME SCALE\n\n1. You should know, from your previous experience in geology, that\ngeologic time has been subdivided into official, named intervals. There is a\nrelative time scale and an absolute time scale. The relative time scale dates back\nto the 1800s; it was well worked out by the end of the nineteenth century. With\nthe advent of radioisotopic dating techniques, absolute ages in years have been\nincorporated into the geologic time scale. The absolute time scale continues to be\nrefined, as more and more reliable dates become available. Only recently, for\nexample, the beginning of the Cambrian was revised from 570 Ma to 543 Ma!\n\n(And that had great implications for the timing of the Cambrian explosion; some\ndetails later).\n2. You need to be exposed to the names of the various subdivisions of\nPhanerozoic time. There is a hierarchy of geologic time units, order of decreasing\nscale:\n\neon\n[eonothem]\n\nera\n[erathem]\n\nperiod system\n\nepoch series\n\nage\n\nstage\n\n(The brackets indicate units that are not in common use.) The reason why there\nare two sets of terms is that stratigraphers differentiate between time units (also\ncalled chronologic units), on the one hand, and time-stratigraphic units (also called\nchronostratigraphic units), on the other hand. The time-stratigraphic units consist\nof the rocks themselves: all the rocks (everywhere in the world!) that were\ndeposited during the given corresponding time interval. You need to understand\nthe difference, for example, between the Cambrian Period ( a defined period of\ntime) and the Cambrian System (rocks deposited during the Cambrian Period).\n3. Figure 9-13 shows just one part of the official time scale, to introduce you\nto the terms that are relevant to the Cambrian explosion. The term Vendian is used\nfor the final interval of the Neoproterozoic. The stage and substage names for the\nLower Cambrian are taken from Russian localities, where the sections are fairly\ncomplete and very well exposed.\n\nPart of the geologic time scale.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 9-13: The part of the geologic time scale spanning the latest Proterozoic\nand part of the Cambrian.\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n3.1.2 The fossil record of the metazoans extends back for about forty\nmillion years before the Cambrian explosion, which itself spans the age range\nfrom about 530 Ma to about 515 Ma (in very round and flexible numbers). The\nbig problem is that that fossil record of metazoans does not contain sequences of\nfossils that allow tracing the morphological evolution that led eventually to the\nCambrian phyla. This long period of obscure and controversial metazoan\nevolution has been called the prelude to the Cambrian explosion.\n3.1.3 It was noted in an earlier chapter that, at a certain point in the history\nof the Ediacarans, trace fossils made their appearance alongside the Ediacarans.\nAt first these traces were very simple: millimeter-wide tracks on the sediment\nsurface. As time went on, the traces become more sophisticated, in the sense that\nburrowing, in addition to surface tracks, appeared. Presumably, it takes a more\nadvanced soft-bodied organism to burrow through the sediment rather than just\ncreeping across the surface of the sediment. The abundance and complexity of the\ntraces increased up into the earliest Cambrian, even after the disappearance (or\nalmost so) of the fossil record of the Ediacarans. The official base of the\nCambrian is now defined on the basis of the appearance of one particularly\n\nFigure 9-14: Some milestones in the evolution of the metazoa\nMileston\nes in the evo\nlution of m\net\nazoa.\n4. What also will be useful for the later material in this chapter is Figure 9-\n14, which shows the relevant part of geologic time, with stratigraphic terminology\nas well as key fossils noted.\n\ncharacteristic burrowing trace fossil, called Trepnichnus pedum, an arcuate\nhorizontal burrow from which branches rise to probe toward the sediment surface.\n\n3.2 The Earliest Biomineralizing Metazoans\n\n3.2.1 The prelude to the Cambrian explosion was not entirely without a\nfossil record of biomineralizing organisms. A few such fossil species have been\ndiscovered in recent years. Here's a brief account of some of them (only genus\nnames are shown):\n\nCloudina: First found in Namibia and then later at several localities around\nthe world, Cloudina coexisted with some of the Ediacarans in latest\nNeoproterozoic carbonate rocks. It consists of curved, tubular, multilayered\nshells. The overall appearance is that of a fitted stack of paper or plastic drinking\ncups.\n\nNamacalathus: Goblet-shaped, with a stem and an upward-flaring cup, a\nfew millimeters to 2.5 cm in diameter, open at the top and with sides perforated\nwith several side holes. The image in Figure 9-15; McMenamin, M.A.S., and\nSchulte McMenamin, D.L., 1990, The Emergence of Animals; The Cambrian\nBreakthrough: Columbia University Press, p. 48. B: Grotzinger et al. 2000; was\nreconstructed by computer from serial sections through a complete fossil\nspecimen.\n\nNamapoikia: A fully biomineralized organism, with a complex and robust\nskeleton, up to 1 m in width and up to 0.25 m in height. The skeleton consists of\nmultiple continuously connected tubules a few millimeters in diameter. It\nencrusted perpendicular to the walls of vertical synsedimentary fissure in\nmicrobial reefs. It probably represents a cnidarian or a poriferan.\n\n3.3 The Explosion\n\n3.3.1 The term Cambrian explosion (less picturesquely, but more\naccurately, the Cambrian radiation) is used for a brief period of geologic time\nwhen many metazoan phyla first appear in the fossil record. The timing is not\nentirely pinned down, but it seems clear that the explosion spans the time interval\nfrom the middle of the Lower Cambrian, 530 to 520 Ma, and lasting until about\n515 Ma. It was during this geologically very brief time period, of the order of ten\nmillion years, when organisms with hard and durable skeletal material became\ncommon. The recent revision of the time of the beginning of the Cambrian, from\n570 Ma to 543 Ma, served to intensify the problem of the Cambrian explosion: it\nmade the permissible time interval much shorter, thus creating an even greater\nproblem for paleobiologists (and, I suppose, providing welcome fuel for the\n\ncreationists!). In the context of geologic time, the biomineralizing organisms\nseem to have exploded into existence. (You saw in an earlier section that there\nwere biomineralizing organisms prior to the great explosion, but they were very\nfew and very uncommon.)\n3.3.2 Figure 9-16, which shows the timing of the appearance of phyla in the\nfossil record, reveals the Cambrian explosion well. As noted earlier, the Cnidaria\nand the Porifera are generally considered to have made their appearance near the\nend of the Neoproterozoic, in connection with the Ediacaran biota. Several other\nanimal phyla made their earliest appearance during the period called the Cambrian\nexplosion, almost simultaneously in the context of geologic time. (Many other\nanimal phyla appear in the fossil record much later.) The explosion first manifests\nitself at the base of the Tommotian Stage, when the earliest biomineralizing\nbrachiopods and molluscs appear in the fossil record. In the succeeding\nAtdabanian Stage, body fossils of echinoderms and arthropods make their\nappearance.\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n3.3.3 Here's an important point: the Cambrian explosion involved more\nthan the appearance of biomineralizing animals. There are a precious and\nvaluable few localities where soft-bodied animals of Atdabanian age are\npreserved, most notably in Yunnan, in China. That suggests that non-\nbiomineralizing animals underwent an evolutionary radiation as well as the\n\nFigure 9-16: The earliest appearance of the various animal phyla in the fossil record\nAppeara\nnce of p\nhyla in t\nhe fossi\nl recor\nd.\n\nbiomineralizing animals. One could argue that earlier soft-bodied faunas existed\nbut have not been found, or existed but are now obliterated by erosion or\nmetamorphism. But in the explosion interval, along with the expansion in types of\nbody fossils, trace fossils also become larger and more varied, implying that soft-\nbodied animals participated in the explosion as well.\n\n3.4 The Burgess Shale\n\n3.4.1 We can't leave the topic of the Cambrian explosion without\nconsidering the fauna of the Burgess Shale. A good case can be made that the\nBurgess Shale locality is the most famous of all fossil localities. Discovered by\nthe paleontologist Charles D. Walcott near the beginning of the twentieth century\n(more precisely, on Tuesday, 31 August 1909!) in British Columbia, on the slope\nof the long ridge between Mount Wapta and Mount Field, a few miles north of the\ntown of Field (and now protected by law from casual visitors), the Burgess Shale\nlocality contains a spectacular assemblage of fossils of soft-bodied organisms,\nmany of them known from nowhere else, along with biomineralized organisms as\nwell. It provides a deeply informative look into the post-explosion world of the\nCambrian. Books have been written just about the Burgess Shale fauna.\n3.4.2 The Burgess Shale soft-bodied fossils are preserved as flattened\nimprints along the bedding planes of the shale. Great effort has gone into\nreconstructing the original three-dimensional bodies on the basis of the imprints.\nIt's an endeavor not without uncertainties, but the results are spectacular. Figure\n9-17; A: Whittington, H.B., 1985, The Burgess Shale: Yale University Press.\n(Fig. 4.7, p. 79.) B: Whittington, H.B., 1985, The Burgess Shale: Yale University\nPress. (Figure 4.22, p. 87) C: Whittington, H.B., 1985, The Burgess Shale: Yale\nUniversity Press. (Fig. 4.31) D: Conway Morris, S., 1998, The Crucible of\nCreation; The Burgess Shale and the Rise of Animals: Oxford University Press,\n242 p. (Figure 19, p. 55); just gives you the flavor of these reconstructions. To do\njustice to them, you need to see photos of the imprints themselves; if you are\ninterested, go to the books by Whittington and by Conway Morris, listed at the end\nof the chapter.\n3.4.3 The great significance of the Burgess Shale fauna is that it shows how\nvaried the Cambrian animal faunas must have been. It is universally assumed that\nthe soft-bodied animals represented in the Burgess Shale fauna were ubiquitous in\nthe Cambrian (and presumably later in the Phanerozoic as well) but were only\nvery seldom preserved--under only just the right conditions for preservation. Just\nimagine how impoverished our knowledge of Cambrian life would have been if\nthe Burgess Shale fauna (and two other similar finds, from somewhat earlier in the\nCambrian, and discovered only in recent years--one in Greenland and the other in\nChina) had not been found.\n\n4. WHY THE EXPLOSION?\n\n4.1 There had to have been a reason why the Cambrian explosion happened\nwhen it did and how it did. There are two rather different ways of looking at the\ncause, or causes, of the explosion. In one view, which seems not to be as widely\nheld as the other, it was a consequence of complex evolutionary interactions\namong the organisms themselves, independently of any outside environmental\ninfluences. You might think of this as a \"biological systems\" approach. In the\nother view, more common, some aspect or aspects of the late Neoproterozoic and\nearly Cambrian environment caused, or led to, or triggered, the explosion.\n4.2 I'm using the term \"environment\" here in a very broad sense: such\nthings as climate, ocean chemistry, atmospheric composition, sea level,\nsedimentation, plate tectonics, continental configuration--and the changes,\nthrough time, of all such environmental factors. Also, might there have been just\none particular change in one particular thing that triggered the explosion? (That's\nbeen termed the \"assassin's bullet\" hypothesis.) Or must we appeal to a\ncombination of environmental effects, working together in some perhaps very\ncomplex way? A variation on the \"trigger\" metaphor is the \"fuse\" metaphor:\nthere might have been some event that led to an evolutionary sequence that\nculminated in the explosion.\n4.3 The most widely cited idea about the cause of the appearance of\nmetazoans has to do with the oxygen content of the atmosphere. The metazoan\nphyla that emerged early in the Cambrian must have needed levels of atmospheric\noxygen not much lower than at present. If levels were too low before the late\nNeoproterozoic, then evolution could not have led to the metazoans at that time.\nThere is indeed some independent evidence that the oxygenation of the\natmosphere took place in two major steps, one far back in the Proterozoic, in\nconjunction with the deposition of iron formation, and the other late in the\nProterozoic.\n4.4 You saw in the preceding chapter that the late Neoproterozoic was a\ntime of spectacular variability in climate (for whatever reason), with snowball-\nEarth (or at least \"icehouse\") conditions alternating with much warmer periods. It\nis natural to think that the synchrony of climate change and metazoan evolution\nwas not fortuitous. Might these severe environmental changes have been the fuse\nfor the rapid evolution of metazoans? It is universally accepted in evolutionary\nbiology that environmental stress tends to result in an increased pace of evolution:\npopulations become small, and they either evolve rapidly to accommodate to the\nchanging environmental conditions or the species they represent becomes extinct.\n4.5 Another attractive idea has to do with the occurrence of what might be\ncalled the great Cambrian transgression. (Recall that the term transgression, or\nmarine transgression, is used for a shift of the ocean shoreline in the direction of\nthe land. Transgression can be worldwide, caused by sea-level rise, or local,\ncaused by subsidence of the lithosphere in the local area. Regressions are the\n\nopposite of transgressions.) One of the first-order facts of the early Phanerozoic is\nthat there was a slow but large worldwide rise in sea level in the course of the\nCambrian and into the Ordovician. At the height of the transgression, much of the\ncontinent of North America, for example, was covered by shallow seas, thousands\nof kilometers across and no more than a few hundreds of meters deep. Such seas,\ncalled epeiric seas or epicontinental seas, are not well understood, because there\nare no good examples in today's world of relatively low sea level (more details in\nthe next chapter). The development of such epeiric seas, with their various\nshallow marine environments, for the first time (in the latter part of geologic time,\nat least), might have been the trigger for the evolutionary radiation of the\nmetazoans.\n\nPART IV. PHANEROZOIC LIFE\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 All geoscientists would agree that life on Earth has interacted in\nfundamental ways with the strictly physicochemical aspects of the planet. You\nhave seen good examples of that idea already in this course: for example, how\nphotosynthesizing organisms have influenced the history of oxygenation of the\natmosphere, as well as the broad outlines of climate by way of the role of carbon\ndioxide in the greenhouse effect. The extreme position in that regard is the Gaia\nhypothesis: that Earth and life have evolved through time in close association with\none another, each regulating the other. Most geoscientists seem not to be willing\nto go quite that far, but it's clear that we can't consider the history of the Earth's\nphysical and chemical environment without taking into account the evolution of\nlife, and vice versa.\n1.2 It's not going to be possible to consider, in this section, many of the\nfascinating twists and turns of the history of life on Earth, which led, in one way\nor another, to the appearance of the enormous diversity of life forms we observe\ntoday. Questions along this line come easily to our minds: How did birds develop\nflight? Where did the dinosaurs come from, and what was the cause of their\ndemise? What caused primates to become distinct from other mammals? To do\njustice to such matters, a full course in the history of life on Earth is needed! (I\nwould like to take such a course myself.)\n1.3 Here, after some comments on the nature of the fossil record, I'll try to\ndeal with the nature of evolution itself, to give you the flavor of how\npaleobiologists view the history of life, and then deal specifically with the history\nof what are called mass extinctions: specific, and catastrophic, times in Earth\nhistory when, for whatever reason or reasons (and the nature of those reasons is\ncontroversial) large percentages of all living species became extinct, opening the\nway for explosive radiations of new life forms to fill the vacated niches. In the\n\nprocess, we'll look at the nature of asteroid impacts, which are implicated in at\nleast some of the mass extinctions.\n\n2. THE NATURE OF THE FOSSIL RECORD\n\n2.1 Generations of paleontologists have agonized over the incompleteness\nof the fossil record. Some even admit to a kind of inferiority complex, arising\nfrom the necessity of having to lead their professional lives working on what they\nperceive to be an inadequate database. Here's a telling quotation along these lines:\n\nPaleontologists often give the impression that they don't believe in\ntheir own subject and the data that fossils provide. Indeed,\npaleontology suffers from several misperceptions which, because\nthey are often propounded by paleontologists themselves, make us\nour own worst enemies. (S.K. Donovan and C.R.C. Paul, 1998, p.\n1.)\n\n2.2 That the fossil record is incomplete is beyond any doubt: we can't\npossibly have a census of all of the organisms that have ever lived. That's not\nwhat worries paleontologists, though: what's troublesome is that it's thought that\nwe are not even close to having a census of all of the species that have ever\nexisted. (Neobiologists generally agree that we're not even close to having a\ncomplete census of existing species!)\n2.3 The record of marine biomineralizing species is generally thought to be\nfairly good; the problem lies more with species of soft-bodied organisms, and with\nspecies of organisms that lived on land, where environments conducive to\npreservation are much less common than in the ocean. Another way of putting\nthis is that the fossil record is strongly biased in favor of skeletalized species.\n2.4 Various attempts have been made over the years to assess the degree of\ncompleteness of the fossil record. Many methods have been proposed. Here are\nsome general considerations, which may not be wildly wrong. Two of the\napproaches that have been taken, presumably complementary, are as follows.\nFirst, ,we know that something like ten percent of all extant species are\nskeletalized and therefore highly likely to be represented in the fossil record. If\nwe assume that the proportions of skeletalized and nonskeletalized species have\nbeen about the same through Phanerozoic time, then, given that almost none of the\nnonskeletalized species have been preserved, the fossil record is about ten percent\ncomplete. Second, in the Burgess Shale fauna, again something like ten percent\n(in very round numbers) of the species represented are skeletalized. If the Burgess\nShale fauna is at all typical of later times in the Phanerozoic, in terms of the\nproportions of skeletalized vs. nonskeletalized forms, then, again, the fossil record\nis about ten percent complete. The number \"ten\" here is of course extremely\nelastic--but the foregoing line of reasoning suggests that the true figure is much\n\ngreater than just, say, one percent, but much less than, say, half. Maybe that gives\nus the flavor of the matter.\n2.5 Paleontologists make a distinction between the completeness of the\nfossil record and the adequacy of the fossil record. Those two concepts are related\nbut different: the record can be incomplete but still adequate for the pursuit of\npaleontological problems, as well as for addressing broader questions in geology\nand biology.\n2.6 Here's just one example of how the incompleteness of the fossil record\nhas affected the thinking of paleontologists about the adequacy of the record. Do\nspecies evolve along gradual trends, or do they develop abruptly (in the context of\ngeologic time, that is) after long periods of stasis? The fossil record is almost\nalways so full of \"holes\" that the matter can seldom be decided on the basis of the\nfossil record. The number of examples of gradual evolutionary trends is\namazingly small; according to one authority, they can be counted on the fingers of\ntwo hands. Paleontologists have seemed to assume, tacitly, that gradual trends are\nthe norm but just can't be identified owing to the inadequacy of the record. But\nmaybe such trends are the exception rather than the rule.\n\n3. EVOLUTION AND SPECIATION\n\n3.1 The term species has appeared often so far in this chapter, without being\ndefined. What is a species? The species is the fundamental taxonomic unit, in\nboth paleobiology and neobiology. Roughly speaking, a species is one particular\nkind of organism. More technically, a species could be defined as a population of\norganisms capable of fertile interbreeding. The concept of species is thus natural,\nnot arbitrary.\n3.2 Of course, there is some degree of variability, in morphology and\nphysiology, from organism to organism within a species. Variation of this kind is\nthe stuff of natural selection--the process by which species change by preferential\nsurvival of organisms with certain features within a species.\n3.3 All \"non-creationists\", scientists and nonscientists alike, are convinced\nthat the living world has developed by a process of evolution. Almost all\nscientists accept that as fact. What has been controversial, and about which debate\ncontinues, is the nature of the processes by which evolution takes place--although\nby now, since the time of the neo-Darwinian \"second revolution\" in the mid-\ntwentieth century, there has been general agreement about the broad aspects of\nevolution. Incidentally, there were evolutionists around before Darwin: they just\ndidn't have the right ideas. It was Darwin, with his theory of evolution by natural\nselection, that put the study of evolution on its modern footing.\n3.4 Darwin described his theory as evolution by natural selection. The basic\nidea is that the members of any species of animals are not identical: they vary in\n\ntheir characteristics, in numerous ways, as a reflection of their genetic material.\nDarwin knew this well, in part because of his close familiarity with animal\nbreeding. It was actually a rather revolutionary concept in science: before his\ntime, it was generally assumed that the members of a species were all identical.\n3.5 Variation is the essential prerequisite for evolution. All house sparrows\nlook just about alike to us (if we look at all that are the same sex and the same\nage), but if we were to measure things like beak shape we would find small but\nsignificant differences. Such variation among the members of a species means\nthat they differ, if only slightly, from individual to individual in their success in\nsurvival and reproduction. The overall characteristics of the species tends to drift\nwith time, in light of this differential success in reproduction.\n3.6 The origin of the variation is mutation, the process by which genes are\naltered, occasionally, as the DNA of the individual replicates itself. Think of these\nmutations as just \"mistakes of copying\". Most mutations are deleterious to\nsurvival, but now and then a beneficial mutation arises, which offers the organism\na greater chance of survival and reproductive success. As such a beneficial\nmutation spreads through the population, the species has undergone change. Of\ncourse, Darwin knew nothing about genetics, let alone nucleic acids and DNA--\nbut he realized the significance of mutations for evolution by natural selection.\n3.7 Evolution of a species by natural selection is especially rapid when the\npopulation is small and environmental conditions are changing rapidly. Under\nthose conditions, only the very fittest individuals survive to reproduce, and any\nvariations that have adaptive value are strongly selected and then can spread\nrapidly through the small breeding population. If environmental stresses are so\ngreat that the evolutionary response of the population of the species can't keep up,\nhowever, the species becomes extinct.\n3.8 If you would like to read a spectacular account of a long-term study of\nevolution by natural selection in action, I recommend The Beak of the Finch, a\nrecent book about a decades-long research program on the finches of a very small\nisland in the Galapagos, by Weiner; see the reading list at the end of the chapter.\n3.9 The development of new species from old species is called speciation.\nThe nature and processes of speciation have been the topic of heated debate\namong neobiologists and paleobiologists alike. In a somewhat oversimplified\nview, there are two ways new species can evolve. The older species can change\ngradually (or not so gradually) into a new species, as implied in the preceding\nparagraph. If the change is gradual, it might be very difficult to draw the line\nbetween the two species, even though the accumulated changes necessitate the\nrecognition of two distinct species. (There's the hidden problem here, which\narises from the accepted definition of a species as a population of organisms that\ncan interbreed to produce fertile offspring: if the populations in question are\nwidely separated in time, there's no way of testing the new population against the\ndefinition!)\n\n3.10 Drawing the line between the two species is not as difficult in practice\nas it might seem, however, because of the spottiness of the fossil record. The\nchanges in species have usually been fast enough that the holes in the record\nprevent identification of the intermediate forms. This gets us back to the statement\nearlier in this section that documented instances of trends of gradual evolution are\nrare.\n3.11 There's another route of speciation, having to do with geographic (or,\nmore generally, environmental) isolation. The populations of given species\nordinarily occupy some rather large geographic range. To the extent that the\nindividuals of the population do not roam very far from their places of birth (or,\nmore precisely, the range of mobility of the individual is much smaller than the\noverall range of the species), then there is the possibility that parts of the overall\npopulation that are located in different geographic areas might evolve along\ndifferent paths. In such a way, a single species might evolve into two\ncontemporary species by geographic isolation. This is especially likely when a\nsmall part of a population becomes isolated from the rest of the population by\nsome new environmental barrier (for example, a change in climate or in sea level).\n3.12 Here is a final, but significant, note. It is good to keep in mind that\npaleontologists have no way of verifying that a given species they choose to\n\"erect\" was really a species! What paleontologists do in practice is to collect a\nsmall or large number of individual specimens which are closely similar among\nthemselves in morphology but which are different in morphology from other\nrelated organisms, and then assume that that group of fossils represents what was\nonce a species in the neobiological sense of being an interbreeding population.\nThey are probably right, usually, but clearly there is no way of ever knowing.\n\n4. CLADISTICS\n\n4.1 You heard in an earlier section about taxa, taxonomy, and systematics.\nTaxonomists place species into genera, and genera into families, etc., in\naccordance with their best guesses about the evolutionary history of the species.\nTaxonomic classification changes as understanding of the evolutionary picture\ngrows. Sometimes, for example, a species is removed from one genus and put into\nanother. It's not that the species has changed--it's just that the understanding of\nthe evolutionary history of that species has changed.\n4.2 There's another, and less formal, way of classifying groups of\norganisms, which is different from the formal taxonomy of species, genera, etc.,\nbut complementary to it. It's called cladistics. Cladistics is an attempt to trace\nphylogeny--the evolutionary pathways by which given species appeared. In\ncladistics, species are organized into what are called clades. A clade is a group of\nspecies that all descended from a common ancestor.\n\n4.3 For an analogy to cladistics, think in terms of a branching tree. Such a\ntree has a single trunk, which branches into a number of main limbs. Each limb\nthen branches into smaller limbs, and so on, until the tips of the twigs are reached.\nThe trunk of the tree represents the common ancestor of all of the species\nrepresented by all of the terminal twigs. Two twigs that branch from the same\nlarger twig represent a clade (a clade with only two species in it), because they\nhave the same common ancestor. Every clade began with a single branching event\nthat produced the ancestor species of the clade. (The only exception to that last\nstatement is the clade that consists of all the species through all of geologic time,\non the assumption that they all had one common ancestor.)\n4.4 The idea behind cladistics is to try to recognize groups of species that\nshare a set of characters that evolved as new features in a common ancestor and\nthen passed to all of the descendant species. The evolutionary state that existed\nbefore those new characters evolved is called the primitive state, and the\nevolutionary state that exited after the new characters evolved is called the derived\nstate. Here's an example, to make that real to you. All living mammals have fur,\nbut no other living organisms do. The natural assumption is that fur was inherited\nfrom a common ancestor of all living mammals. That makes mammals a clade.\nThat hypothesis is strengthened by the observations that all living mammals are\nwarm-blooded and all of them suckle their young.\n4.5 Diagrams that express the paleontologist's concept of a clade (that is,\nthe phylogenetic history of all the species of the clade) is called a cladogram.\nFigure 9-18 shows an example of a cladogram that shows the evolutionary history\nof three species that constitute a clade. Cladograms always show the species of\nthe clade along the upper edge of the diagram. There are three possible\nevolutionary lineages that could account for the three species of the clade. In each\nof the versions, the development of the novel feature that separates the primitive\nstate from the derived state is at a qualitatively different point in the arrangement.\nIn the upper diagram, species B and C form a smaller clade in themselves; in the\nmiddle diagram, species A and B form the smaller clade, and in the lower\ndiagram, species A and C form the smaller clade. How would it be known which\nis the appropriate version? By study of the sharing of derived characters.\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n4.6 To make things more real to you, Figure 9-19 is a cladogram that deals\nwith five major classes of animals (formally recognized classes--as taxa, that is).\nIn this hypothesis (and that's what it represents, a hypothesis, subject to\nmodification if necessary), fishes are the ancestors not just of living fishes but also\nof living amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Note the particular topology\nof the cladogram: tetrapods evolved from fishes by the acquisition of a particular\nderived character (four legs), then reptiles and amphibians developed from a\ncommon tetrapod ancestor, and so on.\n4.7 The cladistic approach leads to some startling insights. For example,\nyou can see from the cladogram in Figure 9-19 that humans are derived fishes,\nderived amphibians, and derived reptiles, all at the same time. Even more\nstartlingly, the case can be made that humans are, in a real sense, derived\ncyanobacteria! Here's a little poem that expresses the idea:\n\nThe human species has thrived\nIn the short time since we arrived\nBut the cladist affirms\nThat we are only worms\nEven though we are somewhat derived.\n\n(Richard Cowen, 2000, History of Life, Third Edition, p. 50.)\n\nFigure 9-18: Three possible cladograms (expressing three different hypotheses) for the\nevolutionary relationships of three species that constitute a clade\nT\nh\nr\ne\ne\n\np\no\ns\nsible c\nladogra\nms.\n\n5. IMPACTS OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL OBJECTS WITH THE EARTH\n\n5.1 This section deals with the nature of impact events, what's known about\ntheir frequency through geologic time, and the implications for the history of life\non Earth. Meteorites are at the small end of the range of extraterrestrial bodies\nthat make impact with the Earth. Over the history of the Earth, such\nextraterrestrial bodies have ranged in size all the way up to the infamous Mars-size\nimpactor that is now thought to have resulted in the formation of the Moon. That\nwas a uniquely large event, but impacts by bodies hundreds of kilometers in\ndiameter are known during later geologic history, even into the Phanerozoic.\n5.2 What happens when a large, fast-moving impactor strikes the surface of\na rocky planet like the Earth? There's an important distinction based on the\nclosing speed of the impactor. If the closing speed is greater than the speed of\nsound (that is, the speed of compressive elastic waves, of the kind that are\ngenerated by earthquakes), then strong shock waves are set up (analogous to the\nsonic boom you hear from an airplane traveling at greater than the speed of sound\nin air), which destroy both the impactor and the target material. Such impacts are\nsaid to be supersonic. They are the most destructive.\n5.3 Think in terms of the energy carried by the impactor, versus the energy\nrequired to do damage to the impactee. Here's some material, slightly\nparaphrased, from Lewis (1997, p. 397), for a hundred-meter asteroid hitting the\nsurface at 20 km/s. (Note: an erg is the cgs unit of work and energy. It's equal, to\none dyne-centimeter. To make that more familiar, we can convert it to foot-\npounds: one dyne-centimeter is equal to about 7.5 x 10-8 foot-pounds. A foot-\npound is the work you do when you lift a one-pound weight upward for a vertical\ndistance of one foot. According to my back-of-the-envelope computations, a\ndyne-centimeter is about the work you would do if you jack up a twenty-five-cent\npiece by a few thousandths of an inch!)\n\nFigure 9-19: (Left) The conventional taxonomic classification of the vertebrates. (Right)\na cladogram for the invertebrates\nCladogram for five ma\njor classes of\nanimals.\n\nThe kinetic energy density [the kinetic energy per unit mass] of the\nimpactor is 2 x 1012 erg/g. The energy required to crush a typical rock\nis a little above 108 erg/g. To heat it to its melting point requires about\n1010 erg/g, and to vaporize it requires less than 1011 erg/g. Thus the\nimpactor carries enough kinetic energy not only to vaporize itself\ncompletely, but also to crush up to roughly 104 times its own mass of\ntarget rock, melt roughly one hundred times its own mass, or vaporize\nabout ten times its own mass. Alternatively, it carries enough kinetic\nenergy to accelerate a hundred times its own mass to a speed of 0.1\ntimes its impact speed. In reality, an impact does all of these things to\nsome degree and divides its energy over all these possible outcomes.\nThus an impactor may crush one thousand times its own mass of rock,\nmelt ten times it mass, vaporize a few times its own mass, and eject\none hundred times its mass at speeds of tens to hundreds of meters per\nsecond and still give off a substantial amount of energy as seismic\nwaves and radiation from the fireball.\n\n5.4 Figure 9-20; Lewis, J.S., 1997, Physics and Chemistry of the Solar\nSystem: Academic Press, 591 p. (Figure IX.15, p. 398); shows the progression of\na typical supersonic cratering event. Here, again paraphrased from Lewis (1997),\nis a description of the events shown:\n\nThe impactor is crushed and flattened by the enormous transient\npressures caused by its deceleration, pushing a cavity into the target.\nThe region of the target closest to the projectile is heated so strongly\nthat, as the peak shock is unloaded by the expansion of the debris from\nthe explosion, it vaporizes. A much larger volume, usually with several\ntimes the radius of the vaporized zone, is thoroughly crushed and\npartially melted. Since the effective center of the explosion is well\nbelow the surface of the target, the explosion blasts out a substantial\nmass of rim material in a cone above the explosion site.\n5.5 The environmental consequences of a major impact are not fully\nunderstood. (Humankind has never experienced one--yet!) Enormous quantities\nof mineral dust would be injected into the atmosphere, all the way up into the\nstratosphere, from which it would take months to years to clear by settling.\nDuring that time, sunlight reaching the Earth's surface would be reduced to only a\nsmall percentage of normal. To the extent that either the impactor or the target\narea contain sulfur-bearing materials, there would be a high concentration of\nsulfur dioxide particles in the atmosphere, causing acid rain far more intense than\nwhat we now experience from burning of fossil fuels. The heat from the fireball,\nwhich itself might last only minutes, might be sufficient to set wildfires of even\nsubcontinental or greater size, putting more smoke and dust into the atmosphere.\nAn impact in the ocean would generate seismic sea waves of gigantic proportions.\n\nSuch effects have serious albeit uncertain consequences for the survival of life on\nEarth.\n5.6 What is the nature of the bodies that have made impact with the Earth?\nIt's common to hear that they are asteroids, which, remember, are rocky bodies\nwith \"ordinary\" orbits (that is, nearly circular, and in the general plane of the solar\nsystem), but it's now believed that most of the larger ones are comets, which have\nhighly irregular orbits and range in distance from the Sun to far beyond the limits\nof what we think of as the solar system. It's common to hear that comets are big\niceballs, but keep in mind that they have rocky cores, and it's those rocky cores\nthat would do the damage upon impact. Another thing about comets is that,\nbecause of their less regular orbits, their closing speeds can be much greater than\nthe typical closing speeds of asteroids.\n5.7 What do we know about the record of impacts? There was a period,\nvery early in Earth history but after the Earth had become largely accreted, called\nthe late heavy bombardment. For long after that, however, and into recent\ngeologic time, there has been a continuing albeit occasional bombardment of\nobjects both large and small. There are some who think they detect an actual\nincrease in frequency of impacts in latest geologic time, in the most recent\nhundred million years or so, but that is a controversial idea.\n5.8 The number of well-documented large impacts is increasing steadily, as\ngeologic work on all of the continents continues. In recent years, especially after\nthe advent of the theory of a really big impact that marked the Cretaceous-Tertiary\nboundary, the discovery of impact structures has accelerated. The known record is\ngetting better and better, but there will always be the problem that the processes of\nweathering, erosion, and sediment deposition on the active surface of the earth\ntend to blur and finally obliterate the record of impacts, thus biasing the record in\ntwo ways: minimizing the frequency of earlier impacts, and skewing the record of\nearly impacts toward the larger events (which are less susceptible to obliteration).\n\n5.9 Figure 9-21 gives you some data on known large impacts through\ngeologic time. Part A gives data on impact structures in North America, and part\nB gives data for the entire world. There have been some really big ones.\n\nD\nata on known large\nimpacts.\n\nFinally, Figure 9-22 is a graph of impact frequency against impact energy.\nThe upper line gives the equivalent information for earthquakes. Any event larger\nthan about the zone delineated by the vertical dashed lines would have severe\nglobal consequences.\n5.10 Even small events would have serious regional consequences,\ndepending of course on location. The Tunguska event, which occurred on 30 June\n1908 (it was an explosion of an extraterrestrial body, of size less than a hundred\nmeters, in the atmosphere, before the body had a chance to make impact with the\nsurface), flattened trees over an area of two thousand square kilometers in Siberia.\nCan you imagine the devastation that would have ensued if that event had\nhappened over the eastern U.S., western Europe, or heavily populated areas in\nIndia or China? From the graph, you can see that the frequency of such an event\nper year is about 10-2, meaning that the average recurrence interval is only of the\norder of a hundred years. We shouldn't be holding our breath, but the likelihood\nof another event of that kind within the lifetimes of some of you in the class is\nquite high.\n\nFigure 9-22: Graph of impact frequency vs. impact energy\nImpact f\nrequency v\ns. impact energy.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n6. MASS EXTINCTIONS\n\n6.1 The evolution of life on Earth has been fraught with setbacks. At\nvarious times in the geologic past, unusually large numbers of species have\nbecome extinct over short periods of geologic time. Such events have been\ntermed mass extinctions. Because skeletalized marine invertebrates have a record\nthat's far better than that of soft-bodied marine organisms, or of terrestrial\norganisms in general, the nature of mass extinctions has been based largely on\nthem.\n6.2 There is no doubt that mass extinctions have occurred. The greatest\nmass extinction of all time (no, it's not the one at the end of the Cretaceous, which\nis alleged to have involved the demise of the dinosaurs) was at the end of the\nPermian: more than ninety percent of all extant species became extinct! The\ncontroversy has revolved around the cause (or causes) of the extinctions.\n6.3 Mainly, three possible causes have been invoked for mass extinctions:\n\n- impacts of large extraterrestrial bodies\n- outpourings of continental flood basalts\n- sea-level falls leading to major regressions\n\nIt seems to make sense that large impacts might lead to widespread, catastrophic\nextinction, given the effects that such impacts are thought to have on the Earth\nsurface environment. The other two possible causes have been much less\npublicized, but they have their responsible proponents.\n6.4 At certain times in Earth history, there have been enormous outpourings\nof basaltic lava onto the Earth's surface. The basalts thus formed, which cover\nlarge areas to great thicknesses, are called flood basalts, and the regions affected\nare called large igneous provinces. They form great volcanic plateaus, both on\nland and under the ocean. Figure 9-23 shows the locations of major continental\nflood basalts and submarine basalt plateaus. These massive emplacements of\nvolcanic rocks originate by processes seemingly unrelated to the normal basaltic\nvolcanism associated with sea-floor spreading. They are generally thought to be\nassociated instead with large mantle plumes. Humankind has never experienced a\nsuch a period of outpouring of basaltic magmas: the rates must have been orders\nof magnitude greater than during any volcanic eruptions in human history. Such\nvolcanism must have injected enormous quantities of greenhouse gases and\nparticulates into the atmosphere and oceans, and the climatic effects, especially\narising from the continental outpourings, must have been substantial.\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 9-24 shows, diagrammatically, how an eruption of continental flood\nbasalts might cause a mass extinction (but keep in mind that the caues-and-effect\npathways shown in Figure 9-24 are all deductive, so we should not take the\ndiagram on faith.)\n\nChain of eruption e\nv\nents.\n\nFigure 9-23: Global distribution of continental flood basalts and oceanic basalt plateaus\nFigure 9-24: Chain of events resulting from eruption of continental flood basalts, with the\nSiberian flood basalts as an example, leading to mass extinction\nDistribution o\nf continental flo\nod basalts and subm\narine basalt plateaus.\n\n6.5 Eustatic (simultaneously worldwide) changes in sea level have long\nbeen implicated in mass extinctions. The idea is this: during times of sea-level\nhighstands, large areas of the continents are covered with shallow oceans,\naffording a great range of habitats for marine organisms. A subsequent large and\nrapid sea-level fall drains the sea away from the continents, eliminating all of\nthose habitats. (Keep in mind that if sea level falls to the level of the continental\nshelf break, there is almost no shallow ocean anywhere in the world.)\n6.6 The possible effects of each of these possible causes of mass extinctions\nthat might have played a role in the extinctions are highly varied, and to a great\nextent rather similar from one to another. Figure 9-25 is a tabulation of the\npossible effects. It's all very deductive, but it gives you an idea of what might\nhave been involved.\n\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nFigure 9-25: Effects of proposed causal mechanisms of mass extinctions\nEffects of mass ext\ninctions.\n\n6.7 There have been various attempts at objective evaluation of the\ncorrelation between the known mass extinctions, on the one hand, and the various\npossible causes, on the other hand. It's a truism in science that a correlation, by\nitself, does not prove cause and effect, but at least if there's no correlation then the\ngiven factor could not have caused the mass extinctions. The best such evaluation\nI have found in the literature is shown in Figure 9-26 (MacLeod, N., 1998,\nImpacts and marine invertebrate extinctions, p. 217-246, in Grady, M.M.,\nHutchison, R., McCall, G.J.H., and Rothery, D.A., Meteorites; Flux with Time and\nImpact Effects: Geological Society of London, Special Publication 140, 278 p.\n(Figure 1, p. 219)).\n6.8 In Figure 9-26, Column A shows, for the entire Phanerozoic, the percent\nextinction of marine invertebrates, stage by stage. (Note 1: By \"stage\" here, I\nmean the official time-stratigraphic unit that is a subdivision of a system, in the\nofficial hierarchy of stratigraphic units. Note 2: Owing to the inherent limitations\non age resolution, all extinctions occurring during a given stage are placed at the\nend of the stage.) Column B shows data on major impact events, both direct, in\nthe form of impact structures, and indirect, in the form of geochemical anomalies\nbelieved to be caused by the impacts, as well as small, glassy objects, called\ntektites, which are produced as the vaporized material re-condenses immediately\nafter an impact. Column C shows the occurrence of outpourings of continental\nflood basalts, and Column D shows three different versions of the curve of\nPhanerozoic eustatic sea level (see the preceding chapter for more details).\n6.9 As shown in Column A of Figure 9-26, at several times in Earth history\nrates of extinction have been much greater than usual. The greatest mass\nextinction of all was at the end of the Permian, and the three other largest\nextinctions were at the end of the Ordovician, at the end of the Cretaceous, and at\nthe end of the Frasnian stage of the Devonian.\n6.10 Another way of looking at the occurrence of mass extinctions is to\ndraw a histogram (a kind of vertical bar graph) that shows percent extinction\nagainst the numbers of geologic time units that were characterized by that percent\nextinction. Figure 9-27 shows such a graph, based on stage-level time-\nstratigraphic units (or parts of stages). Also shown in Figure 9-27 are the so-called\n\"big five\" mass extinctions. The clear message from Figure 9-27 is that there is\nno real break between the minor, background extinctions, which have\ncharacterized most of geologic time, and the larger ones, called mass extinctions.\n\nE\nxt\nin\nct\nio\nns\ni\nnt\nen\nsi\nty\nf\no\nr fossil genera.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n6.11 Still another way of describing mass extinctions is to plot a graph\n(Figure 9-28) that shows percent species extinction, on the vertical axis, against\nthe mean waiting time, in years, between extinctions of the given magnitude. (No\ndetails here on how the data are derived and massaged to make the graph.) In\nclimatology, they do the same kind of thing with floods and rainfall events. Note\nfirst of all that the curve is smooth: there's no big vertical step between small\nextinctions and large extinctions. Here's an interesting question that arises from a\ngraph like this: how far out on the horizontal axis would you have to go to find\nthe waiting time for a mass extinction that kills all of the species on Earth? At\nleast one researcher thinks that it might be in the ballpark of a billion years--\nlonger than the history of multicellular organisms! An important consideration to\nkeep in mind when using a graph like this is that the actual recurrence time can\nvary from tomorrow to a billion years plus: the graph shows only the average. (In\nthe same way, the hundred-year rainstorm might be repeated twice in the same\nyear!)\n\nFigure 9-27: Histogram of extinction intensity for fossil genera in 106 time intervals\n\nA\nve\nra\nge\nw\nait\ni\nng time fo\nr extinctions of given\nintensities.\n\n6.10 The results of the comparisons in Figure 9-26 are interesting, and\nperhaps surprising. There is a clear correlation between the end-Cretaceous\nextinction and the occurrence of a massive impact--but there is also a general\ncorrelation with both volcanic eruption of flood basalts and a sharp sea-level fall.\nTwo of the three other largest mass extinctions were not accompanied by major\nimpacts (or, more precisely, none that are known) but were accompanied by sea-\nlevel drops. As shown by Figure 9-29, the correlation between extinctions and\nflood-basalt eruptions is extremely strong! Does this mean that the eruptions were\nthe direct cause of the extinctions? (It's difficult to construct a scenario in which\nthe extinctions caused the volcanism--but might both have been caused by a third\nfactor?) That seems like a strong hypothesis, but there is still great difference of\nopinion on that score.\n\nFigure 9-28: Graph showing average waiting time for extinctions of given intensities,\nbased on marine metazoan species\n\nFigure 9-29: Correlation between the ages of large eruptions of continental flood basalts\nand stages with peaks in extinction intensity, since 250 Ma\n6.11 If you read any of the popular or semi-popular literature on the end-\nCretaceous extinction, the strong message you would get is that the great\nChicxulub impact was the direct cause of the extinction. The hypothesis, first\ndeveloped in the early 1980s, was based on anomalously high contents of the\nelement iridium in stratigraphic sections around the world at the time of the end of\nthe Cretaceous. Iridium is much more abundant in certain extraterrestrial bodies\nthan in terrestrial materials. Eventually, the culprit impact crater was found, in\nshallow ocean waters off the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, buried beneath\nyounger sediments. Skeptics have pointed out, however, that perhaps the impact\nwas only the final nail in the coffin, in the sense that conditions might already\nhave been made rather unpleasant for life on Earth already, and the effects of the\nimpact pushed so many taxa over the brink of extinction.\n\n7. THE RISE OF LAND PLANTS\n\n7.1 The earliest plants must have been marine organisms. The invasion of\nthe land surface of the Earth by plants was one of the most significant events in\nthe evolution of life on Earth. We don't know when plants first colonized the land\nsurface, because early plants, with their soft tissues, did not fossilize well,\nespecially in the largely oxidizing environment of the land surface.\n7.2 Plants must have had to solve a lot of problems to survive on land.\nMost of these problems involve the atmosphere. Because of the much lower\n\nCor\nrel\nati\non\nbet\nwe\ne\nn\na\nges\nof\nla\nrge\ner\nuptions and stages.\n\ndensity of the atmosphere than of the oceans, plants had to grow against gravity,\nunless they restricted themselves to low, flat mats. They had to evolve some\nwaterproofing technique, to reduce evaporation from moist outer surfaces. They\nhad to develop ways of circulating water, nutrients, and gases between their upper\nparts, which extended up into the atmosphere, and their lower parts, rooted in the\nsoil. They had to adapt their reproductive strategies to the atmosphere.\n7.3 We can imagine a scenario for the evolution of land plants, starting\nperhaps with green algae that lived in habitats that were subject to temporary\ndrying. These algae must already have spread to freshwater habitats from their\nplace of origin in the oceans. That could have happened most easily in coastal\nareas, where brackish-water and fresh-water environments can naturally developed\nfrom coastal estuaries and lagoons; you don't need to envision inland lakes that\nnever had any connection with the sea. They might have evolved spores that\ncould be released into the air, where they would have been dispersed much more\neffectively than in water. There would have been an advantage to projecting part\nof their structure up into the air, because light levels are higher and uptake of\ncarbon dioxide is more efficient. As the plants emerged into the air, they would\nhave evolved the coatings and transport systems needed for survival. Such a\nscenario is only speculative, because there's no fossil record on which to base it,\nonly intelligent deduction.\n7.4 The earliest spores that are thought to have come from land plants first\nappeared in the Middle Ordovician--but there are no fossils of plant tissues\nbesides spores until around the middle of the Silurian. The earliest spores of land\nplants look like those that come from living liverworts. Liverworts, a kind of\nprimitive plant, together with mosses, form the division Bryophyta, one of the\nmain divisions of the plant kingdom. (Botanists use the term \"division\" for a\ntaxonomic unit that's equivalent to the \"phylum\" of zoologists.) Indeed, recent\nmolecular evidence suggests that all land plants today are descended from early\nliverworts.\n7.5 We know that a land flora was well established by the end of the\nSilurian. By that time, vascular plants had made their appearance. Vascular plants\nare those with tubular structures for efficient internal transport of fluids. Land\nplants then became much more diverse in the Early Devonian. As the efficiency\nof vascular systems improved and as structural stiffening material evolved, plants\nwere able to grow taller. By the Middle Devonian, there were fernlike plants with\nwell developed leaves, and trees that grew to over ten meters in height, judging by\nthe tree trunks we see as fossils. By the end of the Devonian, all of the major\ninnovations of land plants had appeared except for flowers and fruit. By\nCarboniferous time, diversity and sophistication of land plants had increased to a\nlevel not exceeded until late in the Mesozoic.\n7.6 The rise of land plants, in the Silurian, made for some fundamental\nchanges in the nature of Earth surface processes. As you know, plants play a\n\nmajor role in stabilizing the soil surface. Before the establishment of land plants,\nerosion by running water must have been much more efficient at mobilizing and\ntransporting the products of weathering. On the other hand, weathering processes\nmust have been less intense, other things being equal, because of the important\nrole of plants in promoting weathering. Plants open up rock by invasion by their\nroots, and the acidic solutions produced by decay of plant material accelerates\nchemical weathering.\n7.7 Another consequence of the stabilization of soils by plant growth is the\nappearance, for the first time in the geologic record, of meandering rivers. It's\nwell known, from studies of modern fluvial environments, that unless the soils of\nriver valleys are well stabilized against erosion the rivers develop a braided\npattern: owing to the freely erodible nature of the bank material, the river is able\nto spread widely, leading to a pattern of shallow, shifting channels. Only when the\nbanks are stabilized by a combination of fine sediment and plant cover do rivers\ndevelop a meandering pattern.\n\nPART V. TIME CORRELATION BY FOSSILS\n\n1 Recall from the chapter on stratigraphy that one kind of stratigraphic unit,\ntime-stratigraphic units, are defined on the basis of time. In order to define and\ndeal with such units in a concrete way, one must be able to make reasonably good\ntime correlations among rocks in different parts of the world. How does one trace\nthe boundaries of time-stratigraphic units? Almost entirely by fossils. This is\nappealingly simple in principle: evolution has given us a non-repeating sequence\nof different species in time. But it is difficult in practice, for a variety of reasons.\nOne of the most important reasons is in a way a chicken-and-egg problem: we\nhave to use the same data base--the fossils in the stratigraphic sections around the\nworld--to do two things at the same time: figure out the evolutionary sequence of\nspecies, and use that sequence to date the strata. For almost two hundred years\nnow it has been a matter of successive approximations, whereby paleontologists\n(or, more precisely, stratigraphic paleontologists, those who are more concerned\nwith using the organisms to make correlations than with the paleobiology of the\norganisms themselves; there is a substantial overlap between the two groups) play\noff their existing knowledge of the sequence of species, on the one hand, and the\nstratigraphic record of exposed stratigraphic sections around the world, on the\nother hand, to continually refine our understanding of the fossil record.\n2 The easiest way to appreciate this problem is to imagine yourself to be the\nfirst stratigraphic paleontologist ever to take a modern approach to a stratigraphic\nsection. (You might try to assume the role of William Smith, the canal engineer\nmentioned in the preceding chapter.) You work out a sequence of fossil\nassemblages in that stratigraphic section and define time-stratigraphic units on the\n\nbasis of that succession, and then, armed with that information, go to another\nstratigraphic section and try to recognize your time-stratigraphic units there by\nlooking at the fossils. Just your common sense tells you that there are factors at\nwork that will make matters difficult for you. For example, the number, duration,\nand position of diastems (breaks in the record) are likely to be different in the two\nsections. So, even aside from such things are imperfect preservation or regionality\nof species, you are likely to find certain of your time-stratigraphic units missing in\nthe new section, and by the same token you will discover new time-stratigraphic\nunits in your new sections, which will force you to redesign your whole scheme of\ntime-stratigraphic subdivision. By now there has been so much work that this\neffect is felt only at the finest level o time-stratigraphic subdivision, but it will\nalways be with us.\n3 Here are some practical things about correlation by fossils:\n\nimperfect preservation\nno organisms lived there\nbreaks in the record\nfacies control\nslow evolution\ngeographic provinces\nfinite spread time\n\n4 From the standpoint of the practicing stratigraphic paleontologist, the\nideal fossils species is one that spread rapidly into a wide range of depositional\nenvironments in all regions of the Earth, built rugged and highly preservable\nskeletal materials, lived in great abundance, and then became extinct after only a\nshort time. The worst kind of fossil species, on the other hand, is one that evolved\nto fit a very narrow ecological niche, lived in only a small part of the world, and\nwas so well adapted to its environment that it existed for a long period of geologic\ntime. (Stratigraphic paleontologists refer to fossil species that lived in very\nspecialized and restricted environments, often with a disparaging tone in their\nvoice, as facies fossils. Ecological paleontologists, on the other hand, love to see\nsuch fossils.) Most fossil species fall somewhere in the middle ground between\nthese two extremes.\n5 In general, as you might expect, the finer we try to cut the time cake, the\nless certain the results. And, of course, it's to be expected that stratigraphers and\npaleontologists are always trying to push the resolution of the fossil record to its\nutmost.\n\nAusich, W.I., and Lane, N.G., 1999, Life of the Past, Fourth Edition.
