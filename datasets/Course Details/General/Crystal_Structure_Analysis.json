There are many books on the market and everybody has different priorities and preferences, therefore this short list is highly biased and by no means complete.\n\nFor starters, the book by Werner Massa (\nCrystal Structure Determination\n, English by Bob Gould, Springer) is an excellent choice. Everything important is explained and the book starts from scratch. This book is sufficient as a companion for 5.069.\n\nMassa, Werner.\nCrystal Structure Determination.\n2nd ed. Translated into English by R. O. Gould. New York, NY: Springer, 2004. ISBN: 9783540206446.\n\nThe somewhat more advanced student may like the\nFundamentals of Crystallography\nby Carmelo Giacovazzo (Oxford University Press). Even though the word \"fundamentals\" appears in the title of the book, it is very helpful to have prior knowledge, when attempting to read the Giacovazzo. This book covers all the basics and should be sufficient for most PhD students.\n\nGiacovazzo, C., ed.\nFundamentals of Crystallography\n. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992. ISBN: 9780198555780.\n\nIf you want to knock yourself out, you may consider reading the four books edited by the master himself: Sir Lawrence Bragg. The books are called\nThe Crystalline State\nand consist of the following volumes:\n\nThe Crystalline State - A General Survey\nby L. Bragg\n\nThe Optical Principles of Diffraction of X-Rays\nby R. W. James\n\nThe Determination of Crystal Structures\nby H. Lipson and W. Cochran\n\nCrystal Structures of Minerals\nby L. Bragg, G. F. Claringbull and W. H. Taylor\n\nBragg, Sir Lawrence, et al.\nThe Crystalline State\n. Vols. I-IV. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1965.\n\nYou may also want to try:\n\nHahn, Theo, ed.\nInternational Tables for Crystallography.\nVol. A: Space-Group Symmetry. 5th revised ed. Dordrecht, Holland: Springer, 2002. ISBN: 9780792365907.\n\nLisensky, George C., et al.\nOptical Transform Kit\n. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Board of Regents, Institute for Chemical Education, 1994.\n\nMacGillavry, Caroline H.\nFantasy and Symmetry: The Periodic Drawings of M. C. Escher\n. New York, NY: Harry N. Abrams, In., 1976. ISBN: 9780810908505.\n\nSchattschneider, Doris.\nVisions of Symmetry: Notebooks, Periodic Drawings, and Related Work of M. C. Escher\n. New York, NY: W.H. Freeman & Co., 1990. ISBN: 9780716721260.\n\nKleber, Will.\nEinfuhrungin die Kristallographie\n. Berlin, Germany: Veb Verlag Technik, 1965.\n\nOther Recommendations\n\nFor the more biologically oriented student, an excellent \"classic\" is:\n\nGlusker, Jenny Pickworth, and Kenneth N. Trueblood.\nCrystal Structure Analysis: A Primer.\n2nd ed. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1985. ISBN: 9780195035438.\n\nChemists that want it in a nutshell may like:\n\nClegg, William.\nCrystal Structure Determination\nNew York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1998. ISBN: 9780198559016. With only 82 pages, this is probably the shortest Crystallography textbook ever published.\n\nThe list goes on and on and on...\n\nHomework\n\nThis class consists of 12 lectures, five problem sessions, one hour devoted to a brief recap and one exam. The problem sessions are structured as follows:\n\nDuring the Wednesday lecture, a homework sheet is handed out, which consists of several problems (ca. five) that the students are supposed to work out (in writing) during the following nine days. On the next Friday, the answer to each homework question is to be presented by a student or a small group of students in front of the class. Students will know in advance who will be presenting each problem so that they can prepare their presentations. After the presentations and a discussion about the problems, the students are supposed to hand in their problem sets, to be graded (one can get up to five points per set of problems).\n\nObviously the students can correct their answers during the presentations, which makes it relatively easy to get full points for the homework sets. This is not a problem, as the goal of having homework in this class is to make the students think about the subjects taught, and to do so outside of the classroom and independently. Even if a student comes to the wrong answer for a problem, the fact that he or she thought about it at home for some time will make correcting it during the homework session an educational experience that has nothing to do with cheating to get full points.\n\nGrading\n\nThe problems and the exam are graded as follows:\n\nA student can get a maximum of 25 points from the problem sets (up to 5 points each) and a maximum of 65 points from the exam. Handing in the homework late results in subtraction of points (more than one week late leads to one point being subtracted, more than two weeks late takes two points away).\n\nAltogether, a student can get up to 90 points. The breakdown into grades is determined after the exam, taking into account the number of points actually accumulated by the students (i.e. if everybody does really badly in one particular exam question, the results for this question can be ignored for the grading altogether, etc.). In any case, it will be possible for a student to pass with the exam alone (at least arithmetically), but not with the homework alone.",

The vector d* is perpendicular to the Bragg\nplanes and has the length |d*| = 2sinθ/λ.\nA reflection is visible when the corresponding set of Bragg planes is in reflex\nposition, that is when Bragg's law is fulfilled.

Indeed, the position of a spot is determined\nalone by the metric symmetry of the unit cell. The intensity of a spot,\nhowever, depends on the contents of the unit cell (and, of course, on\nexposure time, crystal size, etc.).\nThe intensity of a reflection depends, among other things, on the\npopulation of the corresponding set of Bragg planes with atoms. If\nthere are many atoms on a plane, the corresponding reflection is\nstrong, if the plane is empty, the reflection is weak or absent.\nOther factors are the thermal motion of the atoms and the atomic\nradius.\n\nAtomic Form Factors\nX-rays are scattered by the electrons of an atom, hence the point\natom approximation does not hold too well. Ergo: Bragg planes are\nnot mathematical planes but have a fuzzy thickness, which means\nthere is a path difference occurring within each individual Bragg plane.\nDisplacement of the place of diffraction from the ideal position of δ\nleads to a path difference of δ·2π/d. This has a weakening effect on\nthe intensity of the corresponding reflection. This effect is a function of\nthe distance d between the Bragg planes: it becomes stronger with\nsmaller distances (i.e. at higher resolution).\nd\n1⁄2∆\n1⁄2∆\nδ\n\nAtomic Form Factors\nIn a first approximation the atomic scattering factor is dependent on\nthe atom number (number of electrons). With increasing resolution\n(that is decreasing Bragg plane distance, equivalent to higher\nscattering angles 2Θ) the scattering factor becomes smaller.\nRemoved due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nMassa, Werner.

The intensity of a spot,\nhowever, depends on the contents of the unit cell (and, of course, on\nexposure time, crystal size, etc.).\nReflections are weakened by the radius of the atoms (atomic form\nfactor) and the thermal motion of the atoms (temperature factor U).\nBoth these effects are stronger at high resolution.\nd\n1⁄2\n∆\n1⁄2\n∆\nδ\nRemoved due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nMassa, Werner.

A twofold in real space causes a twofold in reciprocal space, a\nmirror, causes a mirror, a fourfold a fourfold, etc.\nThe reciprocal space, however, is always centrosymmetric, and translational\nsymmetry has no effect on the symmetry in reciprocal space. That means a\nP2, P21, P2/m, P21/m, P21/c, etc. all correspond to the same symmetry\ngroup in reciprocal space.\nThe symmetry group in reciprocal space is called Laue group. There are\neleven of them.\n\nSymmetry in Reciprocal Space\nDiffraction pattern of a\ncubic insulin crystal,\nobserved with CuKα\nradiation.\nCourtesy of George M. Sheldrick.

Used with permission.\n\nSymmetry in Reciprocal Space\nThe diffraction pattern is always centrosymmetric (at least in good\napproximation). Friedel's law: Ihkl = I-h-k-l.\nFourfold symmetry in the diffraction pattern corresponds to a fourfold axis in\nthe space group (4, 4, 41, 42 or 43), threefold to a threefold, etc.\nIf you take away the translational part of the space group symmetry and add\nan inversion center, you end up with the Laue group. The Laue group\ndescribes the symmetry of the diffraction pattern. The Laue symmetry can\nbe lower than the metric symmetry of the unit cell, but never higher.\nThat means: A monoclinic crystal with β = 90° is still monoclinic. The\ndiffraction pattern from such a crystal will have monoclinic symmetry, even\nthough the metric symmetry of the unit cell looks orthorhombic.\nThere are 11 Laue groups:\n-1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3/m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m3, m3m\n\nLaue Symmetry\n432, -43m, m3m\nm3m\n23, m3\nm3\nCubic\n622, 6mm, -6m2, 6/mmm\n6/mmm\n6, -6, 6/m\n6/m\nHexagonal\n32, 3m, -3m\n-3/m\n3, -3\n-3\nTrigonal/ Rhombohedral\n422, 4mm, -42m, 4/mmm\n4/mmm\n4, -4, 4/m\n4/m\nTetragonal\n222, mm2, mmm\nmmm\nOrthorhombic\n2, m, 2/m\n2/m\nMonoclinic\n1, -1\n-1\nTriclinic\nPoint Group\nLaue Group\nCrystal System\n\nSpace Group Determination\nThe first step in the determination of a crystal structure is the determination\nof the unit cell from the diffraction pattern.\nSecond step: Space group determination.\nFrom the symmetry of the diffraction pattern, we can determine the Laue\ngroup, which narrows down the choice quite considerably. Usually the Laue\ngroup and the metric symmetry of the unit cell match.\nThe <| E2-1 |> statistics, can give us an idea, whether the space group is\ncentrosymmetric or acentric. Even thought the diffraction pattern is always\ncentrosymmetric, the intensity distribution across the reciprocal space is\nmuch more even for a centrosymmetric space group.\nFrom systematic absences, we can determine the lattice type as well as\nscrew axes and glide planes.\nThis is usually enough to narrow down the choice to a very short list.\n\nE2-1 Statistics\nWe measure intensities I\nI\nF2\nF: structure factors\nNormalized structure factors E:\nE2 = F2/<F2>\n<F2>: mean value for reflections at same resolution\n<E2> = 1\n< | E2-1 | > =\n0.736 for non-centrosymmetric structures\n0.968 for centrosymmetric structures\nHeavy atoms on special positions and twinning tend to lower this value.\nPseudo translational symmetry tend to increase this value.\n\nE2-1 Statistics\n< | E2-1 | > =\n0.736 for non-centrosymmetric structures\n0.968 for centrosymmetric structures\n<|E2-1|> = 0.968\n<|E2-1|> = 0.736\n2kl projection of the reflections of a\nstructure in the space group P-1.\n2kl projection of the reflections of a\nstructure in the space group P1.\nCourtesy of George M. Sheldrick. Used with permission.\n\nSystematic Absences\nLattice centering and symmetry elements with translation (glide planes and\nscrew axes) cause certain reflections to have zero intensity in the diffraction\npattern.

      "content": "Structure Refinement\nThe structure solution from direct or Patterson methods is frequently\nalready very good. However, the coordinates are not quite accurate, the\natom types of some or all atoms have been assigned incorrectly (if at\nall), and details of the structure are missing (H-atoms, disorders, solvent\nmolecules, etc.).\nThe atomic positions in the first solution are not the direct result of the\ndiffraction experiment, but an interpretation of the electron density\nfunction calculated from the measured intensities and the \"somehow\ndetermined\" phase angles.\nBetter phases can be calculated from the atomic positions, which allow\nre-determining of the electron density function with a higher precision.\nFrom the new electron density map, more accurate atomic positions can\nbe derived, which lead to even better phase angles, and so forth. In\nevery such cycle, adjustments to the atomic model are made: atom\ntypes are changed, missing atoms are introduced, etc.\nThis whole process is called structure refinement.\n\nStructure Refinement: Three Main Steps\nClose examination of the Fo-Fc map helps to introduce new atoms and\nremove \"bad\" old ones.\nOnce all non-hydrogen atoms are found, the atoms can be refined\nanisotropically.\nOnce the model is anisotropic, the hydrogen atom positions can be\ndetermined or calculated.\n\nStructure Refinement: Electron Density Maps\nDifferent electron density maps:\nFo map: Electron density calculated using observed structure factures\ncombined with phases calculated from the atomic model. This map\nshows the observed electron density; its accuracy depends largely on\nthe accuracy of the phases.\nFc map: Electron density calculated from structure factors and phases\ncalculated from the atomic model. This map shows the electron density\naccording to the model only.\nFo-Fc map: The difference between the two maps. Has close-to-zero\nvalues for parts of the model that are consistent with the experimental\ndensity, large positive values at places where the model should have an\natom, but does not, and large negative values at places where the\nmodel has an atom, which should not be there. Weaker positive or\nnegative values for the Fo-Fc map could point to wrongly assigned atom\ntypes.\n\nStructure Refinement: Electron Density Maps\nFo map\nModel: A Cp ring\nFo-Fc map\nExamination of the electron density maps shows that ligand in the\ncurrent model is not a Cp ring, but in fact a Cp* ring.\n\nStructure Refinement: Anisotropic Displacement Parameters\nIt is reasonable to assume that atoms move anisotropically, i.e. with\ndifferent amplitudes in different directions. Instead of describing an atom\nas a sphere, it is described as an ellipsoid; the elements of the matrix\ndescribing the ellipsoid are called anisotropic displacement parameters\n(ADP):\n\nStructure Refinement: Anisotropic Displacement Parameters\nThe size of the ellipsoids (or spheres in the isotropic case) is chosen so\nthat the ellipsoid includes 50% electron density of the atom type in the\nmodel. In the example below each ellipsoid or sphere includes 3\nelectrons. Thus, abnormally large or small ellipsoids can point out\nincorrectly assigned atom types or other problems with the model.\n\nEvalution of the Model\nThe model should only be altered if a change improves its quality.\nHow to judge quality of the model?\nLeast-squares approach:\nBy means of Fourier transformation, a complete set of structure factors\nis calculated from the atomic model. The calculated intensities are then\ncompared with the measured intensities, and the best model is that,\nwhich gives the smallest value for the minimization function M.\n(\n)\n∑\n-\n=\nc\no\nF\nF\nw\nM\nF: structure factor; o: observed; c: calculated; w weighting factor (derived from σ).\n\nResidual Values: the R factors\n(\n)\n/\n\n-\n=\n∑\n∑\no\nc\no\nwF\nF\nF\nw\nwR\nwR2: Most closely related to\nrefinement against F2.\n∑\n∑\n=\no\nc\no\nF\nF\nF\nR\n-\nR1: Most popular one, based\non F.\n(\n)\n(\n)\n/\n\n-\n-\n= ∑\nP\nR\nc\no\nN\nN\nF\nF\nw\nS\nGooF: S is supposed to be\n> 1.0\nF: structure factor; o: observed; c: calculated; w weighting factor (derived from σ).\nNR: number of independent reflections; NP: number of refined parameters.\n\nParameters\nFor every atom: x, y, z coordinates and one (isotropic) or six\n(anisotropic) displacement parameters.\nFor every structure: overall scale factor osf.\nPossibly additional scale factors, maybe a Flack-x-parameter.\nAtom types are also parameters, even thought they are not refined.\nIncorrectly assigned atom types can cause quite some trouble.\nAltogether: The number of parameters is roughly ten times the number\nof independent atoms in a structure.\nThe UICr says: For a stable refinement: the data-to-parameter-ratio\nshould be > 8 for non-centrosymmetric structures and > 10 for\ncentrosymmetric structures. I ca. 0.81 A or 2Θ = 50° (Mo).\nConstraints and restraints improve the data-to-parameter-ration:\nconstraints remove parameters, restraints add to data.\n\nConstraints\nConstraints are mathematical equations, rigidly relating two or more\nparameters or assigning fixed numerical values to certain parameters,\nhence reducing the number of independent parameters to be refined.\nSite occupation factors are constraints present in every structure. Even\nfor disordered atoms the sum of the occupancies is constrained to add\nup to 1.0.\nHydrogen atoms can be \"placed on mathematically calculated positions\nand refined using a riding model\".\nThat means X-H distances and H-X-H or H-X-Y angles are constraint to\ncertain values. Not the hydrogen positions!\nAtoms on special position require constraints for their coordinates,\noccupancies and sometimes also their ADPs:\n\nSpecial Position Constraints\nAn atom on a twofold axis along b.\nA 180° rotation must not change the\nposition of the atom or the shape of\nthe thermal ellipsoid.\nFrom the first condition follows:\n(x, y, z) = (-x, y, -z), which is only true\nfor x = z = 0.\nThe second condition dictates:\n(U11, U22, U33, U23, U13, U12) =\n(U11, U22, U33, -U23, U13, -U12), which is\nonly true for U23 = U12 = 0.\nNo good\nGood\nThe most popular refinement program generates special\nposition constraints automatically. Big relief!\n\nRestraints\nRestraints are assumptions used to introduce chemical or physical\ninformation into a refinement as additional experimental observations.\nRestraints are treated as data (with a standard uncertainty).\nMinimization Function including restraints:\n(\n)\no\nt\nc\no\nR\nR\nF\nF\nw\nM\n-\n+\n-\n=\n∑\n∑\nσ (\n)\nF: structure factor; o: observed; c: calculated; w weighting factor; σ: standard uncertainty\nassigned to the restraint; Rt: target value for restraint quantity; Ro: actual value.\nRestraints should be used with great care and only if justified. When\nappropriate, however, they should be used without hesitation, and\nhaving more restraints than parameters in a refinement is nothing to be\nashamed of.\n\nGeometrical Restraints\nOne can restrain a group of atoms to lie on a common plane (e.g. a phenyl\nring) or an interatomic distance or a bond angle to a certain target value\n(direct distance restraints).\nAlternatively, one can restrain equivalent distances to be equal (relative\ndistance restraints, aka \"similarity restraints\").\nAdvantage of relative distance restraints: No need for \"outside\" information,\nrefinement converges well (esp. for Z'>1).\nDisadvantage: underestimated standard uncertainties of bond lengths and\nangles. And it is too easy to refine a structure in a space group with too low\nsymmetry.\n\nGeometrical Restraints\nAll 10 atoms lie in\none common plane\nSimilar distances\nSimilar angles\n\nADP Restraints\nIt is fair to assume that atoms bound to one another move similarly, both in\ndirection and amount.\nOne can restrain the anisotropic displacement parameters of two atoms in\nthe direction of the bond between them to be equal within a given standard\nuncertainty (e.g. 0.01). This is called a \"rigid bond restraint\".\nIt can be assumed that atoms that are bound to one another move in\nsimilar directions with approximately similar amplitudes. Therefore, one\ncan restrain atoms close to one another to have the same Uij components\nwithin a given standard uncertainty (e.g. 0.04). This is called a \"similar-\nADP restraint\".\nThe second assumption is much bolder then the first one, hence the much\nlarger standard uncertainty.\n\nADP Restraints\nsimilar-ADP\nrigid bond\nisotropic\nbehavior\nCourtesy of Thomas R. Schneider. Used with permission.\n\nProblems and Pitfalls\nThe big advantages of X-ray structure analysis are that it is very objective\nand can determine the structure of even very complex molecules. E.g.\nNSF + LiOC(CH3)3 in C5H12\nNSOC(CH3)3 + LiF\n{Li8[(CH3)3COS(F)N]4F2} {Li4[OC(CH3)3]5}2·4C5H12\nDisadvantages are that you do need crystals and that the accuracy of bond\nlengths and angles is relatively low (ca. 0.02 to 0.001 A). With some\nspectroscopic methods (e.g. rotational spectroscopy), interatomic distances\ncan be determined 100 times more accurately.\nAnother disadvantage is that the structure determined is the spatial\naverage over the entire crystal and the temporal average over the data\ncollection time (hours). This makes it impossible to study dynamic\nprocesses. However, those processes can leave their traces behind...\n\nProblems and Pitfalls: Wrong Space Group\nAt least 1% of the crystal structures are published in the wrong space\ngroup. Frequently, symmetry elements (esp. inversion centers) have been\noverlooked.\nWhen an inversion center is overlooked, the consequences can be very\nserious. The refinement is mathematically unstable (saddle point instead of\nminimum). Bond lengths that should be equal fly apart (e.g. 1.52 A Æ 1.38\n+ 1.66 A) and the same happens to the displacement parameters of atoms\nrelated by the center.\nIt is not so bad when other symmetry elements are overlooked. The\nrefinement is stable but too many parameters are refined against too many\ndata. The structure is not distorted, but is less precise than if the data had\nbeen averaged in the correct Laue group and fewer parameters used to\ndescribe it.\n\nCommon cases of wrong space groups\nP1 Æ P1 Æ C2/m Æ R3m\nC2 Æ C2/c Æ R3c\nC2 Æ Fdd2\nC2 Æ R32\nC2 Æ I222\nCc Æ Fdd2\nOften an inversion center or a centered lattice with higher symmetry\nare overlooked. A long series of papers by Marsh and others\ndocument wrong space groups reported in the literature.\nA particularly revealing example was a P1 space group corrected by\nMarsh (1999) to C2; this correction was then corrected to Fdd2 by\nSpek in 2000 (Acta Cryst. B56 744).\nCheckCIF, used to check all small molecule structures submitted to\nActa Cryst., would have caught this example.\nFigure courtesy of George M.

Sheldrick.\n\nDisplacement Parameters\nAs mentioned earlier, after anisotropic refinement, atoms are represented\nby 50% probability ellipsoids. Abnormally large or small ellipsoids, as well\nas ellipsoids with strange shapes, tell us something about problems with\nthe refinement.\nTwo or more positions of a disordered atom can be represented by a large\ndisplacement ellipsoid. E.g. A disordered ethyl group:\n\nDisplacement Parameters\n290 K\n112 K\nThermal motion of atoms in the crystal\ncan also lead to large ADPs.\nThe very large ellipsoids in the anion\nN(SO2F)2\n- at room temperature can be\nexplained either with strong atomic\nmovement or disorder.\nIn this case, the normal staggered\nconformation at 112K and the ecliptic\nconformation at 290K make this look\nmore like a disorder. This is\ncorroborated by the bond lengths:\n290K: S-O and S-F all similar between\n1.24 and 1.36 A\n112K: S-F 1.57, S=O 1.42 A\nN\nS\nS\nF\nF\nO\nO\nO\nO\nFigures courtesy of George M. Sheldrick.\n\nMore on Displacement Parameters\nrefined as carbon, even though there are three oxygen atoms and one\nnitrogen atom in the molecule. As carbon has 6 electrons, all ellipsoids are\ncalculated to contain 3 electrons from the calculated electron density.\nNitrogen and oxygen have more electrons than carbon, making the electron\ndensity higher at oxygen and nitrogen sites than at places where we have a\ncarbon atom. That leads to a smaller volume of the corresponding ellipsoid,\nas 3 electrons are only 43% of a nitrogen and only 38% of an oxygen.\nThe ADPs can help with\nthe assignment of atom\ntypes:\nEach thermal ellipsoid\nis drawn around 50% of\nthe electrons of the\nelement in the model.\nIf the atom in the real\nmolecule is heavier than the atom in the model, then the\nvolume including 50% of the electrons of the modeled\nelement is smaller.\nIn the refinement that lead to the image, all atoms were\n\nLibration\nA\nB\n∆r\nr\nThe higher the temperature, the shorter bond lengths appear to be, even\nthough the unit cell gets slightly larger at the same time. The reason for this is\nlibration. Especially terminal atoms show approximately circular motion. In\nanisotropic refinement, this motion is fitted as an ellipsoid, the center of which\nlies inside the circle of motion, while the atom is loated on its periphery. This\neffect makes the bond distance appear shorter.\nDepending on the movement of the atoms, the correction that needs to be\napplied is somewhere between 0.001 - 0.1 A. Libration is much stronger at\nhigher temperatures and particularly pronounced for hydrogen atoms, small\nions, like NO3\n-, BF4\n-, ClO4\n-, PF6\n- and for -CF3 groups.\nUB\nUA\nFor most low-temperature structures,\nthe effects of libration are smaller than\nthe standard uncertainties of the bond\nlengths and it is not necessary to correct\nfor it.\n[\n]\nr\nU\nU\nr\nU\nr\nA\nB\n-\n=\n∆\n≈\n∆\nFigure courtesy of George M. Sheldrick.\n\nFerrocene: Ecliptic or Staggered?\nFe D5h\nor Fe D5d\nThe first X-ray structure analysis (in 1956 at room temperature) showed Z = 2\nin P21/c. Thus, the molecule must sit on an inversion center. Therefore it also\n\"must\" be staggered (D5d). Electron scattering in the gas phase (1968) showed\napproximate D5h geometry.\nThe high-temperature X-ray data can be understood\nas disorder of a D5h structure, as the ADPs of the\ncarbon atoms remain large even at somewhat lower\ntemperature (173 K, 1979).\nTwo more low-temperature structures have been determined later: A triclinic\nphase at 164K was found to be almost D5h (deviation ∆φ ca. 9o) and an\northorhombic phase at 98 K was exactly D5h within the experimental error.\nFigure courtesy of George M. Sheldrick.\nFigure courtesy of George M. Sheldrick.\n\nHydrogen Atoms\nIt is electron density that we measure by X-ray diffraction. The heavier an\natom is and the more electrons it has, the stronger is its effect on the\ndiffraction pattern. This also means that, especially in the presence of\nheavy atoms, light atoms are somewhat more difficult to localize. The\nlightest atom of all is hydrogen: it has only one electron, localized away\nfrom the nucleus. Therefore, hydrogen atoms are notoriously difficult to\ndetect with X-ray diffraction methods.\nRelatively high electron density between the atoms and libration effects\nmake X--H bonds appear too short.\nC -\n- H\nH -\n- C\n<C--H>X-ray\nca. 0.96 A\n<C--H>neutron ca. 1.09 A\nFigure courtesy of George M. Sheldrick.\n\nHydrogen Atoms\nEspecially for hydrogen atoms bound to carbon it is frequently possible to\ncalculate the hydrogen positions from the coordinates of the atoms the\nhydrogen atoms are attached to, as the standard bond lengths and angles\nare well known.\nHydrogen atoms of water molecules must be detected in the experimental\nelectron density or else they cannot be included into the model.\nEven more difficult to detect can be hydrogen atoms in heavy metal\nhydrides. The sometimes relatively strong Fourier truncation ripples close\nto heavy atom positions can overpower the rather weak electron density\nmaxima representing the hydrogen atoms. Very accurate and especially\ncomplete high quality data and proper scaling are required to distinguish\nthose hydrogen atoms from the background noise.\n\nHydrogen Atoms\nIn most cases, the positioning of hydrogen atoms bound to carbon in an\natomic model during the refinement of an X-ray crystal structure is done\nentirely without any or only very little direct information from the diffraction\nexperiment. Hydrogen atoms on aromatic carbons, CH, CH2 groups, most\nCH3 groups are easy. CH3 in acetonitrile, Cp* or toluene: torsion angle\nneeds to be determined.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n5.069 Crystal Structure Analysis\nSpring 2008\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Symmetry in Reciprocal Space\nThe diffraction pattern is always centrosymmetric (at least in good\napproximation). Friedel's law: Ihkl = I-h-k-l.\nFourfold symmetry in the diffraction pattern corresponds to a fourfold axis in\nthe space group (4, 4, 41, 42 or 43), threefold to a threefold, etc.\nIf you take away the translational part of the space group symmetry and add\nan inversion center, you end up with the Laue group. The Laue group\ndescribes the symmetry of the diffraction pattern. The Laue symmetry can\nbe lower than the metric symmetry of the unit cell, but never higher.\nThat means: A monoclinic crystal with β = 90° is still monoclinic. The\ndiffraction pattern from such a crystal will have monoclinic symmetry, even\nthough the metric symmetry of the unit cell looks orthorhombic.\nThere are 11 Laue groups:\n-1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3/m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m3, m3m\n\nLaue Symmetry\n432, -43m, m3m\nm3m\n23, m3\nm3\nCubic\n622, 6mm, -6m2, 6/mmm\n6/mmm\n6, -6, 6/m\n6/m\nHexagonal\n32, 3m, -3m\n-3/m\n3, -3\n-3\nTrigonal/ Rhombohedral\n422, 4mm, -42m, 4/mmm\n4/mmm\n4, -4, 4/m\n4/m\nTetragonal\n222, mm2, mmm\nmmm\nOrthorhombic\n2, m, 2/m\n2/m\nMonoclinic\n1, -1\n-1\nTriclinic\nPoint Group\nLaue Group\nCrystal System\n\nSpace Group Determination\nThe first step in the determination of a crystal structure is the determination\nof the unit cell from the diffraction pattern.\nSecond step: Space group determination.\nFrom the symmetry of the diffraction pattern, we can determine the Laue\ngroup, which narrows down the choice quite considerably. Usually the Laue\ngroup and the metric symmetry of the unit cell match.\nThe <| E2-1 |> statistics, can give us an idea, whether the space group is\ncentrosymmetric or acentric. Even thought the diffraction pattern is always\ncentrosymmetric, the intensity distribution across the reciprocal space is\nmuch more even for a centrosymmetric space group.\nFrom systematic absences, we can determine the lattice type as well as\nscrew axes and glide planes.\nThis is usually enough to narrow down the choice to a very short list.\n\nE2-1 Statistics\nWe measure intensities I\nI\nF2\nF: structure factors\nNormalized structure factors E:\nE2 = F2/<F2>\n<F2>: mean value for reflections at same resolution\n<E2> = 1\n< | E2-1 | > =\n0.736 for non-centrosymmetric structures\n0.968 for centrosymmetric structures\nHeavy atoms on special positions and twinning tend to lower this value.\nPseudo translational symmetry tend to increase this value.\n\nE2-1 Statistics\n< | E2-1 | > =\n0.736 for non-centrosymmetric structures\n0.968 for centrosymmetric structures\n<|E2-1|> = 0.968\n<|E2-1|> = 0.736\n2kl projection of the reflections of a\nstructure in the space group P-1.\n2kl projection of the reflections of a\nstructure in the space group P1.\nCourtesy of George M.

After applying several corrections, they translate\ninto squared structure factors also known as structure factor amplitudes F2.\nintensities I:\nI\nF2\nF: structure factors\nThe Fourier transform of the structure factors (with phases) is the electron\ndensity function. The Fourier transform of the structure factor amplitudes (as\nmeasure, without the phases) is the Patterson function. The unit cell of the\nPatterson map is the same as that of the crystal structure.\nThe Patterson function has some very interesting features:\nIt consists of peaks, that have coordinates (u, v, w) and an intensity\nThe distance of each peak from the origin corresponds to an interatomic\ndistance in real space.\nThe height of the peaks is proportional the involved electrons and\nproportional the multiplicity of the corresponding vector in real space.\nThese features make it possible to use the Patterson map to solve the\nphase problem\n\nThe Patterson Function\nThat means, a peak u, v, w in the Patterson map indicates that atoms exist in\nthe unit cell at x1, y1, z1 and x2, y2, z2 such that\nu = x1 - x2\nv = y1 - y2\nw = z1 - z2\nThus, for N atoms in a unit cell, the Patterson map will contain N peaks.\nN out of these N2 peaks will be of zero length from each atom to itself. All\nthese zero vectors will fall on top of one another in the origin of the\nPatterson map, which generates a very high zero-peak.\nTaking this into account, the Patterson map contains N2 - N + 1 theoretically\ndistinguishable peaks.\nIn real life many of those peaks, which are relatively broad, will overlap and\nbe, in fact, not distinguishable from some neighbor peaks. Usually, the\nstrongest peaks, corresponding to vectors between heavy atoms, are well\nresolved and usable.\n\nThe Patterson Function\n∑\n⋅\n⋅\n⋅\n=\ni\nj\ni\nZ\nZ\nZ\nm\nH\nAs mentioned the relative height of a Patterson peak is proportional the\natom number of the two atoms involved and also proportional the multiplicity\nof the corresponding distance:\nj\ni Z\nZ\nm\nH\n⋅\n⋅\n∝\n∑\n=\ni\nThe origin peak (its height is ) is usually arbitrarily scaled to\nZ\nH\n999. That means the height of the other peaks is calculated to\nThe sum is over all atoms in the unit cell.\n\nOne Heavy Atom in P-1\nFor every atom at x, y, z there is a symmetry equivalen atom at -x, -y, -z and\nhence a Patterson peak at 2x, 2y, 2z.\nThe compound C32H24AuF5P2 crystallizes in P-1 with two molecules per unit\ncell (that makes one per asymmetric unit). The two gold atoms are related by\nthe inversion center. Besides the peak on the origin (height 999) there is a\npeak with height 374 at u = 0.318 = 2x, v = 0.471 = 2y, w = 0.532 = 2z, which is\nmuch higher than all the other peaks (≤145). Its height is consistent with the\ncalculated value for a Au-Au vecort (377).\nTo calculate the positions x, y, z of the gold atom in the unit cell, we can divide\neach of the Patterson coordinates by 2. However, we also need to take into\naccount the fact that there is always a peak at u+1, v+1 and w+1\n(corresponding to next unit cell in the crystal)! Thus:\nx = 0.318/2 = 0.159 or 1.318/2 = 0.659\ny = 0.471/2 = 0.236 or 1.471/2 = 0.736\nz = 0.532/2 = 0.266 or 1.532/2 = 0.766\nThose eight truley equivalent solutions correspond to the eight possible\npositions of the inversion center in the space grup P-1.\n\nTwo Independent Heavy Atoms in P-1\nThe compound [C24H20S4Ag]+ [AsF6]- crystallizes in P-1 with a unit cell volume\nof 1407 A3. This corresponds to two formula units per unit cell (one per\nasymmetric unit). We have two heavy atoms per formula unit (As and Ag),\ncorresponding to the coordinates x1, y1, z1 and x2, y2, z2. Their symmetry\nequivalents as generated by the inversion center in P-1 are at -x1, -y1, -z1 and\nat -x2, -y2, -z2.

Thus the Patterson is\nalways centrosymmetric.\nIn general, the symmetry of the Patterson is determined by the symmetry of\nthe diffraction pattern (also centrosymmetric). Glide planes and screw axes of\nthe space groups correspond to mirror planes and normal rotation axes in\nreciprocal space. The Patterson has the same symmery as the Laue group.\n\nHarker Sections\nSpace group symmetry leads to accumulation of Patterson peaks in\ncertain sections (planes or lines). E.g.\nP21: atoms at x, y, z and -x, 1⁄2+y, -z. Æ Eigenvectors at 2x, 1⁄2, 2z;\nHarker section at v = 1⁄2.\nHarker section at v = 0.\nPm: atoms at x, y, z and x, -y, z. Æ Eigenvectors at 0, 2y, 0;\nHarker section at u = 0, w = 0.\nSpace groups P2 und Pm both have the same systematic absences\n(none), but they have different Harker sections.\nP2: atoms at x, y, z and -x, y, -z. Æ Eigenvectors at 2x, 0, 2z;\n\nProblems of the Patterson Method\nFrequently localizing a single heavy atom in a structure is enough to find all\nother atoms by means of iterative difference Fourier syntesis with amplitudes\n|Fo-Fc| and phases φc.\nProblems arise in non-centrosymmetric space groups when the heavy atom\nsubstructure is centrosymmetric (e.g. only one heavy atom). In this case, all\nφc-values derived from the heavy atom positions are 0o or 180o and the\ncalculated electron density is centrosymmetric, i.e. it shows a double-immage.\nAnother problem is the atom-type assgnement: Electron density and Patterson\npeak heights are proportionel to atomic number, however only roughly and\nisoelectroic species are notoriously difficult to distinguish. This is problem\nalso with diret methods and sometimes even during structure refinement.\n\nDirect Methods\nDirect methods determine the phases directly from the diffraction pattern\nwithout any knowledge about the nature of the sample.\nSeveral statistical equations relate the phase of a reflection to its intensity\nand the intensity and phase of other reflections in the dataset. This can be\ndone with a certain probability. Many probability relations together with\nfast computers make it possible to determine the phases of many\nmeasured reflections with some accuracy.\nDirect methods usually do not use structure factors but operate in E-space\n(remember the normalized structure factors from the E2-1 statistics?). The\nadvantage is, that the intensity of a normalized structure factor does not\ndecline with the resolution; and direct methods assume atoms to be point-\nscatterers anyway.\nDirect methods are used predominantly as \"black-box\" methods and we\ndon't really have the time to change that here.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n5.069 Crystal Structure Analysis\nSpring 2008\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Let us chose some\nrepresentative point in the unit of pattern, and mark the position of\nsimilar points in all the other units. If these points be considered\nalone, the pattern being for the moment disregarded, it will be seen\nthat they form a regular network. By drawing lines through them, the\narea can be divided into a series of cells each of which contains a\nunit of the pattern. It is immaterial which point of the design is\nchosen as representative, for a similar network of points will always\nbe obtained.\"\nBragg, Sir Lawrence, et al. The Crystalline State, Volumes I-IV.

The\nrhombohedral system can be understood as a special case of the\ntrigonal system, but some crystallographer count it as a separate\ncrystal system.\nTaking into account possible lattice centerings, there are 14 so\ncalled Bravais lattices.\n\nThe 14 Bravais Lattices\nTriclinic:\na = b = c, α = β = γ = 90°\nLattice: P\nMonoclinic:\na = b = c, α = γ = 90° = β\nLattice: P, C\nOrthorhombic:\na = b = c, α = β = γ = 90°\nLattice: P, C, I, F\nTetragonal:\na = b = c, α = β = γ = 90°\nLattice: P, I\nTrigonal/Hexagonal:\na = b = c, α = 90°, γ = 120°\nLattice: P, R\nCubic:\na = b = c, α = β = γ = 90°\nLattice: P, I, F\n\nLaue Symmetry\nThe Laue symmetry is the symmetry in reciprocal space (taking into\naccount the reflex intensities). Friedel's law is assumed to be true.\nThe Laue symmetry can be lower than the highest metric symmetry\n(e.g. monoclinic with β = 90°), but never higher.\n\nLaue Symmetry\n432, -43m, m3m\nm3m\n23, m3\nm3\nCubic\n622, 6mm, -6m2, 6/mmm\n6/mmm\n6, -6, 6/m\n6/m\nHexagonal\n32, 3m, -3m\n-3/m\n3, -3\n-3\nTrigonal/ Rhombohedral\n422, 4mm, -42m, 4/mmm\n4/mmm\n4, -4, 4/m\n4/m\nTetragonal\n222, mm2, mmm\nmmm\nOrthorhombic\n2, m, 2/m\n2/m\nMonoclinic\n1, -1\n-1\nTriclinic\nPoint Group\nLaue Group\nCrystal System\n\nSpace Groups\nInstead of 17 in two dimensions, in 3D there are 230 different ways of\ncombining symmetry elements with translation and lattice centering:\nthe 230 space groups.\n\nSpace Group No 10\nRemoved due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see:\nHahn, Theo, ed.

      "content": "A crystal is a three dimensional\nperiodic discontinuum. It consists\nof identical \"bricks\" called unit\ncells, which form a three-\ndimensional lattice.\nThe unit cell is defined by the\naxes a, b, and c, and the three\nangles α, β, γ, which form a right-\nhanded system.\nα\na\nb\nc\nγ\nβ\nVolume of the unit cell V:\nV = abc [1-cos2α - cos2β - cos2γ + 2cos2α - cos2β - cos2γ]1⁄2\nGoing 3D\nCourtesy of George M. Sheldrick. Used with permission.\n\nThe Unit Cell\nThe unit cell is the smallest unit that can generate the entire crystal\nstructure only by means of translation in three dimensions.\nWithin each unit cell there may be several symmetry related copies of\nthe asymmetric unit but in general those are oriented differently.\nEven though in the structure of\nNaCl there is an atom at every\ncorner of the unit cell, such an\narrangement is rather rare.\nIf the structure is centro-\nsymmetric, the unit cell is\nchosen so that its origin lies on\nan inversion center.\nElse: conformity with other\nsymmetry elements (see\nVolume A International Tables\nfor Crystallograpy).\nCourtesy of George M. Sheldrick. Used with permission.\n\nCrystallographic Conventions\nUnit cell: Right handed system a, b, c, α, β, γ\nTriclinic system: a ≤ b ≤ c\nThe monoclinic angle is β with β ≥ 90°. This makes b the unique axis in\nthe monoclinic system.\nIn the tetragonal, trigonal and hexagonal systems, c is the unique axis.\n\nUnconventional Lattices\nE.g.: Monoclinic B can always be\ntransformed into monoclinic P,\nwith half the unit cell volume.\nMonoclinic I can always be\ntransformed into monoclinic C\nwith the same unit cell volume.\nThat is why the list of the 14\nBravais lattices does not\ninclude monoclinic B nor\nmonoclinic I nor several\nother unconventional lattices.\n\n41 and 43 screw axes\nnm axes:\n1) Rotate 360/n counter clockwise.\n2) Shift m/nth of a unit cell (positive).\nE.g. 41 and 43 axes:\n41: Rotate 90deg counter clockwise\nand shift 1⁄4 up.\n43: Rotate 90deg counter clockwise\nand shift 3⁄4 up.\nNote: 3⁄4 up is equivalent to 1⁄4 down!\nWith crystals you can always add and\nsubtract 1.\n\nSpace Groups\nInstead of 17 in two dimensions, in 3D there are 230 different ways of\ncombining symmetry elements with translation and lattice centering:\nthe 230 space groups.\n\nAtomic Coordinates\nThe coordinates of the atoms within a unit cell are given as 0 ≤ x < 1,\n0 ≤y < 1 und 0 ≤z < 1. Thus distance between two atoms x1y1z1 and\nx2y2z2 is:\nd = (x2-x1)a + (y2-y1)b +(z2-z1)c oder d = a∆x + b∆y + c∆z\nThe x, y, and z coordinates are also used to describe symmetry\noperations:\nIf there is an atom on the place x, y, z\nx+1,y,z is the equivalent atom in the next unit cell in x-direction (a cell\naxis).\n-x,-y,-z is generated by an inversion center at 0,0,0.\n\nRed Modification of PbO\nTetragonal with a = b = 3.98 A, c = 5.02 A.
