  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nRecitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nOverview\n\nThis intermediate organic chemistry course focuses on the methods used to identify the structure of organic molecules, advanced principles of organic stereochemistry, organic reaction mechanisms, and methods used for the synthesis of organic compounds. Topics include spectroscopy, spectrometry, and structure elucidation with an emphasis on the application of infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Additional specific topics include:\n\nMolecular Orbital Theory and Pericyclic Reactions\n\nModern Concepts of Bonding and Aromaticity\n\nThe Woodward-Hoffmann Rules\n\nMechanism of Pericyclic Reactions and Applications in Synthesis\n\nChemistry of Functional Groups\n\nEthers, Epoxides, Amines and Carboxylic Acids\n\nEnols, Enolates\n\nChemistry of Reactive Intermediates\n\nCarbocations, Radicals\n\nRequired Text\n\nMcMurry, John.\nFundamentals of Organic Chemistry\n. 6th ed. Pacific Grove, CA: Thomson-Brooks/Cole, 2006. ISBN: 9780495012030.\n\nAdditional Texts\n\nMcMurry, Susan.\nStudy Guide and Student Solutions Manual for John McMurry's Organic Chemistry.\n6th ed. Belmont, CA: Thomson-Brooks/Cole, 2003. ISBN: 9780534409340.\n\nWade, L. G., Jr.\nOrganic Chemistry.\n5th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002. ISBN: 9780130338327.\n\nClayden, J., et al.\nOrganic Chemistry.\nOxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2000. ISBN: 9780198503460.\n\nMolecular Models\n\nSeveral units in 5.13 will emphasize stereochemical aspects of organic reactions and molecules. To help you visualize stereochemical concepts, we recommend that you purchase the WH Freeman HSG Molecular Structure Model Set\nTM\n. Note that you will be permitted to bring model sets to the hour exams and the final.\n\nProblem Sets\n\nEight problem sets will be required throughout the semester and are worth 10% of your final grade. These problem sets should be handed in to your recitation instructor at the beginning of lecture on the dates announced (or earlier). No late work will be accepted.\n\nWritten solutions are given for each problem set in the\nassignments\nsection. In addition, \"drill problems\" will be assigned approximately every week in conjunction with the weekly reading assignments.\n\nExams\n\nThere will be four exams in addition to the final. These exams will be held during the class lecture time. Review sessions will be scheduled prior to each exam. Please notify course instructors and the Chemistry Education Office of any conflicts or concerns regarding taking exams at the scheduled time. Conflict exams generally will be scheduled for the same day as the regular exam.\n\nAbsolutely no make-up\nexams will be given for a missed exam. To accommodate unexpected illnesses, family emergencies, and other conflicts, one of the 50-minute exams will be dropped when calculating your final grade. The purpose of the dropped exam is to relieve extra stress and pressure during a particularly difficult time in the semester. Use this option with caution because you cannot predict if a serious emergency will arise later in the semester.\n\nRegrade Policy\n\nYou may submit a graded 50-minute exam to your TA for a regrade up to one week after it is returned to you. Oral or late requests for regarding will not be accepted. Include a justification for the basis of your regrade. Please note: We will regrade the entire exam and photocopy it for our records.\n\nGrading\n\nThe 50-minute exam with the lowest score will be dropped.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nRemaining Three 50-Minute Exams (300 pts)\n\n60%\n\nFinal Exam (150 pts)\n\n30%\n\nProblem Sets (50 pts)\n\n10%\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nStudents will not turn in assignments that are the result of copying the work of another student or by using the work or solutions from this course given in previous years. However, discussing the homework problems is permitted and encouraged after attempting to work the problems independently. During an examination, a student will not:\n\nAccept or use information of any kind from other students.\n\nRepresent the work of another student as his or her own.\n\nUse aids to memory other than those expressly permitted by the examiner.\n\nFollowing an examination, a student will not try to deceive instructors or graders by mispresenting or altering his or her previous work. In advance of an exam, a student will not knowingly obtain access to the exam questions.\n\nThe following excerpt was taken from section 10.2 of MIT's Policies and Procedures, \"MIT assumes that all students come to the Institute for a serious purpose and expects them to be responsible individuals who demand of themselves high standards of honesty and personal conduct. Cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, deliberate interference with the integrity of the work of others, fabrication or falsification of data, and other forms of academic dishonesty are considered serious offenses for which disciplinary penalties can be imposed.\" Thus, any infraction of academic integrity will be dealt with as outlined in section 10.2 of MIT Policies and Procedures and could result in disciplinary penalties, including suspension and expulsion.",

For the thermal case (heat stimulus), the molecular\norbitals of the alkene looks like this:\nLUMO\n(alkene)\nHOMO\n(alkene)\n> Therefore, we need the electrons in the HOMO of one alkene entering the LUMO of\nits reacting partner, which, in this case, is disfavored due to a antibonding interaction:\nThis makes\nAntibonding\nBonding interaction.\nthe addition\nInteraction\nDISFAVORED!!\n> When light is used as the energy source instead of the heat, the electronic configuration\nof the alkene changes, as one electron from HOMO jumps to the LUMO:\nthe new\nLUMO\nHOMO\n(alkene)\nlight (hv)\nsingly-occupied\nHOMO\nmolecular orbital\n(alkene)\n(SOMO)\n(excited state)\n> Now, this \"new HOMO\", which contains a single electron, can interact with the em\n'\npty\nLUMO of an unexcited alkene (there's plenty of this around because, after all, it s more stable\nthan the excited state).\nHOMO\n(excited alkene)\nLUMO\n(unexcited alkene)\n> This type of approach, where one both orbitals of one molecule approach its reacting partner\nfrom the same side of the molecule, is called suprafacial.

Jamison\nAssignment and Study Guide for Unit I\nMethods for the Elucidation of the Structure of Organic Compounds\n\"...no single tool has had a more dramatic impact upon organic chemistry than infrared\nmeasurements. The development, just after the second Great War, of sturdy and simply\noperated machines for the determination of infrared spectra has permitted a degree of\nimmediate and continuous analytical and structural control in synthetic organic work\nwhich was literally unimaginable fifteen years ago... Physical methods, and the principle\nthat they should be used wherever possible, are now part of our armamentarium, and we\nmay expect no surcease of further developments in this direction.\n\"Nuclear magnetic resonance is even now on the horizon, and we shall be surprised if it\ndoes not permit another great step forward.\"\nR.

For each method, we will discuss its physical basis, how\ncharacteristic data are affected by molecular structure, and the most useful\napplications of these data in structure elucidation.\n2.\nWe will apply the above methods (and others) to the elucidation of organic molecular\nstructures, using a three-stage strategy: Determination of molecular formula,\nidentification of functional groups, and elucidation of connectivity.\n(Nearly) Foolproof Protocol for Organic Structure Determination\nA. Molecular Formula\n1. Determine molecular formula using elemental analysis (EA) and MS.\n2. Determine index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD = # rings + # !-bonds) from\nmolecular formula.\nB. Functional Groups\n1. Identify functional groups using IR and 13C NMR (and 1H NMR occasionally)\n2. Determine symmetry (a.k.a. degeneracy) by comparing 13C NMR to molecular\nformula.\nC. Connectivity\n1. Identify molecular fragments using data from 1H NMR:\na. spin-spin splitting\nb. integration\nc. chemical shift\nd. ...and MS fragmentation (can be done earlier in elucidation)\n2.

Identifying the types of functional groups in a molecule based on the chemical shift\nof each peak. In contrast to IR spectroscopy, the number of each type of functional\ngroup (e.g. 2 chemically non-equivalent ketones) often can be determined.\n1H NMR is useful for:\n1. Determining the number of chemically non-equivalent (or \"different types of\")\nhydrogen atoms in a molecule, based on the number of peaks in the spectrum. Note:\n\"number of peaks\" in this case does not include the splitting pattern (see below), e.g. a\ntriplet is considered to be one \"peak\".\n2. Determining the relative number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms by\nmeasuring the relative area of each peak (by integration of each curve - not by\nmeasuring the relative peak heights).\n3. Identifying neighboring functional groups based on the chemical shift of each peak,\nwhich is a measure of the chemical environment of each proton in the molecule.\n4. Determining which carbon atoms are connected to which based on the splitting\npattern or multiplicity of each peak. This information is the most useful of all the\nmethods we have discussed in determining the connectivity of the molecule, i.e.\nassembling all of the functional groups and fragments identified into an actual structure.\nThe substitution test is used to determine whether two atoms or\ngroups are chemically non-equivalent:\n1. Replace each atom or group in turn with \"X\".\n2. If these two structures are identical (can be superimposed) or are enantiomers, then\nthe two atoms or groups are chemically equivalent (homotopic and enantiotopic,\nrespectively) and thus are indistinguishable by NMR spectroscopy.\n3. If the two structures are different (e.g. diastereomers - making the two groups\ndiastereotopic, alkene isomers, structural isomers), then the two atoms or groups are\nchemically non-equivalent and may be distinguishable by NMR spectroscopy.\n\n5-2\nCharacteristic Functional Group Chemical Shifts in 13C NMR (ppm)\nAlkanes\nOrganohalogen\nMethyl (RCH3)\n0-30\nC-F\n70-80\nMethylene (RCH2R')\n15-55\nC-Cl\n25-50\nMethine (RCH(R')(R\"))\n25-55\nC-Br\n10-40\nQuaternary (RC(R')(R\")(R'''))\n30-40\nC-I\n-20-10\nAlkenes\n100-150\nKetones, Aldehydes\n185-220\nAromatic\n120-160\nCarboxyl Derivatives\nAlkynes\n70-90\nAcids\n150-185\nNitriles\n110-125\nEsters\n155-180\nAlcohols, Ethers\n50-90\nAmides\n150-180\nAmines\n40-60\nCarbamates\n150-160\nReg\nion\ns o\nf t\nhe\n13C\nN\nMR\nS\npe\nc\ntrum.\nThe Physical Basis of the NMR Phenome\nno\nn.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n5-3\nImages of C NMR Spectra for 2-pentanone and 3-pentanone removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see: http://www.aist.go.jp/RIODB/SDBS/cgi-bin/direct_frame_top.cgi?lang=eng\n\n5-4\nR\ne\nm\na\nr\nk\na\nb\nle\nSen\ns\ni\nti\nvi\nty\no\nf 1\n3C\nNMR\nto\nCh\nemi\ncal\n.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nRema\nr\nk\nabl\ne S\nensitivity of 13C NMR to C\nhemical Structure continued.\nFigure by MIT OCW."
