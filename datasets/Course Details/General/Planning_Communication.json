  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session\n\nOverview\n\nThis three-week module, centered on a focal case, represents the second part of the Department's introduction to the challenges of reflection and action in professional planning practice. As such, it builds on the concepts and tools in 11.201 and 11.202 in the fall semester. Working in teams, students will deliver a 20-minute oral briefing, with an additional 10 minutes for questions and comments, in the week of Ses #5 and Ses #6 (as detailed on the assignment and posted course schedule). The teams will brief invited guests (\"briefees\") taking the roles of decision makers. DUSP faculty and fellow students may also be in attendance.\n\nThe course has several main objectives:\n\nTo enhance skills in oral communication, supported by effective analysis, under real-world time constraints and professional expectations\n\nTo enhance skills for working effectively in teams, including designing a division of labor, coordinating that labor effectively, managing relationships, and managing self; and\n\nTo strengthen students' skills for understanding and working with the competing objectives and the political, ethical, and economic challenges that confront decision makers who are handling complex planning problems.\n\nFormat\n\nThe course includes four main class meetings (over two weeks), a day for dry-run briefings, and several evenings of final briefings. Students who have completed their final briefings are welcome to attend the briefings delivered by other teams. We will provide food and drink for each of the class meetings, plus some snacks and drinks at the final briefings.\n\nGroupwork\n\nStudents will work in teams of five or six members, of whom one will be a point of contact for the teaching team. Each team is free to organize its work and assign roles as it thinks appropriate. Functioning effectively within teams, and helping to lead teams to high levels of performance, is increasingly vital in professional life worldwide. The course includes an overview of teamwork concepts and team self-assessment materials developed by faculty at the MIT Leadership Center, who are helping to shape an important field of professional development.\n\nTeaching Team Roles\n\nThe faculty role is to design and deliver the main course content, lead coaching at the dry runs, clarify expectations throughout, and evaluate all student work. The teaching assistant provides support on the content design, organization of teams, and course logistics. Each of the coaches-MCP2s who have all been through the team briefing experience-will work with a set of student teams to make them more effective, advising on how to approach the work, understand course expectations from the student perspective, and stay sane (!).\n\nRequirements, Evaluation, and Feedback\n\nStudents are expected to participate actively in class activities and to contribute consistently to their team's preparation of the dry-run and final briefings. The class meetings will be professionally video taped and streamed to the Web within about 24 hours (to serve as a reference), but should you need to miss a class meeting because of an academic conflict or personal emergency, inform your team and make special arrangements, as needed, to complete your part of the team's work.\n\nWe will provide feedback on your dry-run briefing to help you make needed changes. Only the final briefing will be graded. It constitutes 100% of your course grade. You and your team will participate in a debrief session to review your final briefing video with course faculty. Soon afterward, you will receive a detailed memo conveying feedback on your team's performance (see sample online). Lastly, you will be asked to evaluate the course.\n\nCourse Materials\n\nRequired reading for the main class meetings is minimal but important, including:\n\nthe course assignment and this syllabus and schedule, covering logistics and expectations;\n\na primer on preparing and delivering an oral briefing for decisionmakers;\n\na sample student briefing (video);\n\nsample feedback memos on student briefings (names removed); and\n\nbrief primers on making teams work, enhancing creativity in teams, and team self-assessment.\n\nGroupwork should be focused on the\ncase materials\nonline, which encompass case-specific plans and background analyses plus broader concepts of urban redevelopment and placemaking. There is no need for every team member to print or review these lengthy reference documents. In fact, you may not need to print them at all.",

      "content": "11.914 Gateway: Planning Communication\nFollowup with Susan Silberberg\nAmanda and Frank spoke with Susan on the phone on Sunday evening, February 11, 2007. We used the\nquestions from groups as starting points. Hopefully we've covered all the main questions that were sent.\nWhat is the Mayor's authority?\nThe Mayor can get what he wants if he wants this to be a flagship project, it will be. He has unrivalled\npower to get people together and get things done. Although the BRA and Mayor are separate, he will\nappoint the BRA director.\nAll great projects have the backing of a highly placed person; this project is no different. If the Mayor\ncomes out in support of it, the project will take off. He must get involved. Someone has to take\nleadership and the Mayor is the most likely. The National Parks Service is there, but has no money.\nMass General Hospital is not interested. The City needs to take ownership and champion this. Susan\nemphasized this.\nWhat is the contextual framework for the different sectors of government?\nState regulations are set independently from the SPDF requirement. These regulations were drawn up by\nthe city and approved by the State.\nThe CNY plan will become an amendment to the Municipal Harbor Plan; the State will then approve this.\nThe State could reject the plan but is unlikely to, because they are kept informed through the process via\nthe Municipal Harbor Committee this makes small tweaks to get everyone happy. There is potential for\nmaneuvering here for example the City could leave unpopular decisions to the State to impose. In June\n2006, the draft plan was released to the public, and a 60day comment period followed. The planners are\nwaiting to do a presentation to the City. In the meantime, the people at the State agencies have changed\n(partly due to the change in administration). Tweaking of the plan is expected and, potentially, desired.\nThe State Coastal Zone people have always been on board.\nIs there a real problem with the conflict of interest? (i.e. BRA as land owner, planning authority,\nand economic development body)\nThe conflict of interest will always be there, in this instance it is as much of an issue as any other project.\nBRA has internally approved the plan before making it public, so they have resolved their own internal\ninterdepartment issues. Remember that the BRA is not a single entity. It has director, but there are\nmultiple factions (asset management, economic development, planning and zoning, etc.)\nHow will the plan be carried out (the management organization, etc)? How will it be funded?\nBRA has no capacity as a programming organization. Instead the plan suggests a voluntary nonprofit\nmodeled on Friends of Fort Point Channel (FFPC). This will manage facilities/programming after\nimplementation.\nThe organization will be more active than FFCP, since there are bigger issues to deal with on this site\n(particularly with the historic facilities). It would be formed from local nonprofits, land owners etc.\ne.g. National Park Service (NPS), Mass Gen Hospital (MGH). Funding via Chapter 91 licenses, money\nfrom developers, private sponsorship, tenants paying dues.\n\nNPS would probably be the lead programming partner (like the Children's Museum is for Fort Point).\nThey have no financial resources to contribute (most of their budget goes on security for the USS\nConstitution). Unlikely to be conflict between the NPS and the management organization.\nMGH would need to be persuaded that involvement is worthwhile. Thus far, they have not been very\ninvolved, since they see no benefit to contributing.\nThis organization needs to be set up some existing organizations are compromised by previous\npositions. (There is currently a Friends of the Navy Yard organization that was formed in opposition to\ndevelopment). It takes time, leadership, and resources--a fresh DUSP graduate should go and sort it out!\nIf the organization is set up and the Mayor is in support, it will be possible to get going. At the moment\neverything is waiting for this organization to emerge, no one else at present is capable of doing it.\nWhat consultation has the BRA carried out? How did the consultation process work? Community\ninvolvement? Outreach to Charlestown?\nA lot of consultation more than half of meetings held in Charlestown (at the Knights of Columbus Hall\nin the Uptown neighborhood) not in the CNY. Local newspaper given all info after meetings. BRA\nneighborhood planner (Carlos Montanez, a DUSP grad) led the outreach.\nOther Boston wide bodies involved Conservation Law Foundation, Save The Harbor Save The Bay, etc.\nBoston Harbor Association attended every meeting.\nInteresting to compare with South Boston there, the neighborhood had a strong emotional attachment to\nthe waterfront and took an active role in development planning. Charlestown is less passionate; it comes\ndown to topics like parking.\nThe plan is designed for a wide constituency, including Charlestown residents. Tourism elements are\ngood, but key point is universal access to the Harborwalk. In general, there is broad support for the plan\n(story loops, etc.)--it's just that the Charlestown residents are not emotionally invested in the area and\nfeel no attachment to the Navy Yard.\nSPDF clarifications\nBuildings are required to have FPA space on the first floor, which can be used for restaurants, retail, etc.\n(but not housing or office space). Since no restaurants or shops want to move out to the CNY right now,\nthere are a lot of buildings with vacant ground floor space. Parcel 4 has 20,000 sq. ft. of empty FPA.\nFor a clear breakdown of the $100 per sq. ft. SPDF issue for Pier 5, see page 59 of the Waterfront\nActivation Plan.\nThe planners want all the SPDF space to be builtout (i.e. ready for use). The developer must provide\nSPDF space rentfree and with free utilities for the lifetime of the license. The plan seeks to spread out\nthe 34,000 sq. ft. of statemandated SPDF around the CNY (several small attractions rather than 1 big\nmuseum). The idea is to get a critical mass of cultural SPDF spots so that then restaurants and retail will\nbe attracted to the FPA space to revitalize the CNY.\nThe reserved SPDF space must be interior space (this is a problem for CNY since some attractions are\noutdoorsy, but good because attractions will be more yearround). SPDF has no formal definition but it\nneeds to be a major attraction (e.g. moving the Aquarium, except that the Aquarium can't afford this).\nThe proposed Maritime Interactive Park (story loops, etc.) would probably count as a SPDF.\n\nThe example of Building 114: FPA never filled in MGH building and it has been empty for 6 years.\nNothing for the public, MGH not exerting themselves to fill it. So the idea of spreading out the spaces and\nmaking the developer offer rentfree space is to avoid more empty spaces. Several smaller sites will make\na network of places to visit. Can see no other way of doing this unless the BRA builds, fits out, and offers\nthe site.\nSpalding rehab center is committed to coming to the site and it is a great use for the site. Lots of activity,\nstaff, patients etc.\nWhat about the Moran AutoPort (MassPort facility across the channel from our site)?\nThis is staying. Bulk cargo (like automobiles) is one of the successful areas for MassPort, so different\nuses for that site are not under consideration."

      "content": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSample Feedback on Team Briefings\n\nCase: Anacostia Waterfront Initiative\n\nTeam \"X\"\n\nOur evaluation covers your briefing, visual aids, and handout, though the\nfeedback below may offer more on one of those than the other elements.\n\nBriefing (content and delivery)\n\nYour team excelled in several key dimensions: You made specific criticisms of\nthe light rail decisionmaking process conducted to date (rather than offering\ngeneralities about the need to consult more); you had a strong visual package\nto illustrate the geography and visual interest inherent in this strategy area and\nto offer us a clear storyboard from start to finish (and you supplemented the\nmain briefing with rich back-up data and a useful case comparison to Portland);\nand team members responded very directly to briefee questions. The latter\nhelped you compensate for the limited attention, up front, to the threshold\nquestion of whether light rail is likely to be worth it. You also coordinated well as\na team.\n\nAs for individual speakers, Student-A's overview was clear, and her brief\nstatement of the project's potential was helpful (in real life, you'd try to find out\nin advance where the key decisionmakers are most skeptical or are likely to\nneed the most help: The idea of the light rail? Specifics on implementation? The\nlead agency's role in a complex inter-agency plan? Something else?).\n\nYour up-front recommendations were clear, followed by a preview with a\nstraightforward logic. Student-B's outline of how principles of equitable\ndevelopment was clear and well timed: Other groups needed this but didn't have\nit. Ditto the analysis of alternatives. Likewise, Student-C offered a specific\ncritique, well supported by visuals, of the weak stakeholder engagement carried\nout so far. Note that the Board chair's later question is still a key one:\nGovernment should do a better job of consulting, fine, but what exactly is our\norganization's role vis-a-vis that problem? This is a concern born of years of\npushing agencies to do better at what they are entrusted to do: You have to set\npriorities and understand your role, or you'll get nowhere. But the key is that\nyour briefing persuaded us to think that far: Your case that public involvement\nefforts to date have been inadequate was well made. The slide with two simple\nlists (consulted, insufficient consultation) was superb to \"nail\" this case.\nStudent-D's wrap-up was effective: detailed and persuasive.\n\nThe more detailed recommendations were well summarized. We especially\nappreciated the attention to what the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation (AWC)\nPage 1 of 2\n\nneeds to learn and why one needs to build the capacity of resident stakeholders\nto participate in a complex, many-issue decisionmaking process over time.\n\nResponses to our questions were well informed. In a longer briefing, you would\nwant to listen carefully to the concerns and extend your analysis to meet them.\nYou did this on the overall value of light rail as a policy strategy, citing Portland\nand clear links to needs East of the River (though a deeper analysis would get\ninto job projections, ridership, traffic and other disruption costs, etc.). On the\nparticipation front, you devoted considerable energy to a planning process that\nanother agency had run and seemed surprised at Goldsmith's query about\nAWC's role. It isn't clear, at this point, that there will be an AWC in a few\nyears--a vigorous institution with influence, that is, not just a corporation on\npaper--and you didn't really have the political data with which to assess the\nspecifics of holding the transportation agency accountable. So it was fine to\nunderscore how poorly run the agency's process really was and, in terms of the\nAWC role, to re-connect the transportation strategy to AWC's larger aim of\nengaging affected communities in revitalization decisions.\n\nFinally, your team managed time well, covering the additional information\ncontained in the Portland example and the important connection to Federal\ntransportation legislation. It was an excellent, informative briefing all around.\n\nVisual aids (slides) and handout\nYou had many excellent slides. The data were well selected and clearly\nsummarized. The visual storyboard was simple, logical, and persuasive, taking\nus from your recommendations to each component, unpacking it, returning to\nthe core, using maps to re-place us in context. These were some of the best\nslides we saw all semester--on consultation, links to AWC's mission (for coalition\nbuilding strategy), physical planning alternatives, and more. A few reminders:\nDon't ever lead with abbreviations (LRT, CBO) in early slides. Spell things out in\nalmost all cases. If \"community\" means \"community residents,\" say that, or\n\"community organizations and residents\" if you mean both (or whatever else\nyou mean). The handout is well organized and clearly written; it conveys key\ntechnical insights as well as the crucial institutional aspects--why, if AWC wants\nthis strategy area to succeed, it must strengthen participation and make it\nmeaningful.\n\nYour score and grade\n\nIn scoring each group, we weighed substantive argumentation first and\nforemost, considering delivery only to the extent that it related directly to your\neffectiveness as argument makers (or persuaders). Above, we comment on style\nbut didn't score it. We considered visuals as an additional element, weighing\ncontent more heavily than use. Score: 97, Grade: A\nPage 2 of 2"

But physical positioning of\nthe team was a problem: She seemed hidden behind other team members\nwho \"lurked\" near the briefees. You need to minimize distractions and place\nthe focus on the speaker and the visuals.\n\nThe logic of the briefing was interesting: Tenant engagement is the\nfoundation (not an after-thought), and it enables physical design tools to\nmake a difference.

Also,\nwatch the wonk-ish1 jargon: \"facilitate accountability and reciprocity.\" It was\ntricky to see the connection between some of these points and the slides\n(see below), too--a problem that affected several presenters. One slide per\nmain point might have helped us \"button\" the two together.\n\nStudent C's most effective contributions were in response to questions,\nextemporaneous (unscripted), in exchange with Xav. Again, this is the\nopportunity in a briefing--to create a conversation that informs or teaches\nimportant points--and not a sign of shortcomings. Student C's explanation\nof risks in various engagement strategies signaled preparedness, more than\nthe easy answers that aren't credible (in the field) any more. But on repeated\nquestioning, try not to aim for the one right answer. You're not being tested.\nYou're in an informed conversation with stakes for real decisions: Explore the\noptions with the briefee. You don't need to know everything.\n\n1 \"Wonk\" is an idiom. It's \"know\" spelled backward. In the simplest terms. a wonk is\ntechnically savvy but only that. Wonks struggle to build constituencies for their\nideas. We use \"wonkish\" to convey a style of speech that is needlessly complex,\neven inaccessible.\nPage 1 of 2\n\nIn general, Students D and E also had important points but relied heavily\non notes and rushed somewhat, making it harder for us to understand key\npoints made by both. A reference to \"it is not here,\" for example, left us\nwondering, as we looked again at the slide, \"what's the 'it'\"? Student E's\npoints about reactions of the tenants were critical, but they seemed directed\nat the screen.\n\nCherie Abbanat noted that transition remarks, to get you from speaker to\nspeaker, were some of the team's best, because they were \"off script.\"\n\nThe closing message could have been simplified for greater impact, and you\nprobably should have noted Commonwealth's uncommon demographic\nmake-up. That is, context matters. The supporting slide (Principles for future\nredevelopment) was too \"busy,\" offered too much text. A graphic integrating\nthe physical and non-physical elements of your message here would have\nbeen super.\n\nVisual aids (slides)\n\nToo many of the visuals seemed weakly linked to the spoken points, also\noddly timed, as though you needed more practice with the slides and some\nrevision to get a clear and persuasive \"storyboard\" together--a logical,\nintuitive package to back up your remarks.\n\nOn the other hand, individual slides were gems, e.g. Slide 8 (Physical design\ninterventions), which combines a clear header with specific design advice and\nquotes by residents. Plus several that follow in that section. These would be\nenormously helpful to key briefees, or secondary audiences, not in\nattendance. These have a stand-alone quality.\n\nScore: 90\nGrade: B+\n\nPage 2 of 2"

      "content": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nFeedback on Team Briefings\n\nCase: Anacostia Waterfront Initiative\n\nTeam \"Y\"\n\nOur evaluation covers your briefing, visual aids, and handout, though the\nfeedback below may offer more on one of those than the other elements.\n\nBriefing (content and delivery)\n\nYour briefing had a number of key strengths: An easy-to-follow\ndecomposition of the problem; clear attention to the Anacostia Waterfront\nCorporation's (AWC's) role and competencies; and an effective outline of\npolicy options (grounded in available analysis) as well as data needs.\n\nBut the presentation of the Market Creek development in San Diego was\nsomewhat confusing, as the main presentation touted it and yet, under\nquestioning, you expressed doubt that it would translate well to Anacostia.\nPresenting the risks or drawbacks to that model, since it was your focal\nmodel, was important. Also, the visuals were not very visual, though text\nwas clear, and you over-used the core slide (even though \"signposting\" is\nimportant). A map or two would have let you connect business development\nto the transportation and watershed restoration topics, since both promise to\nchange mobility patterns dramatically over the long run, and transit-oriented\nshopping districts could be a natural East of the River. An excellent slide on\n\"adjusting\" the Market Creek lessons to suit the Anacostia/AWC context--this\nis at least as important as touting 'community partnership' as a goal--got\nburied in your \"appendix.\" And we needed more attention to risks in this\nhigh-risk strategy area, since planning can trigger markets but not control or\npredict them very well. But in general, the briefing offered a clear exposition\nof key opportunities that lie ahead in a critical strategy area, grounded in a\nsolid read of the context.\n\nAs for individual speakers and points, Student A's intro was clear and well\nlinked to the preview slides. The agenda slide was busy and overly complex;\nthis needed another revision or two. Student B set up the implementation\nspeakers effectively, and simple slides helped at this point. Student C's\noutline on attracting outside retail was missing a reference to retail demand:\nBeyond their concerns about crime and expensive land development,\nretailers under-estimate the buying power of inner-city communities. This\nwould be a key selling point for AWC in this strategy area. Also, we could\nhave used the key points about \"adjusting\" (Market Creek versus AWI) here.\nStudent D made an energetic pitch for locally-owned retail, and time ran\nshort as Andy and Xav posed questions about how AWC could leverage as\nmuch as possible in this relatively high-risk domain.\nPage 1 of 2\n\nOverall, you conveyed the potential of a community-responsive retail\ndevelopment strategy and highlighted financial and other roles for AWC\neffectively. It would have strengthened your briefing had you highlighted\nrisks or pitfalls as well, since the record on locally planned economic\ndevelopment is so mixed, and Market Creek is, for now, just one place.\n\nVisual aids (slides) and handout\nAs noted above, key slides were so dominated by text that you missed\nopportunities to use images (whether maps, photos, charts, or other: See\nTeam R's slides) to strengthen the message and give the viewer-listener\nrelief (variety). You took the admonition to have and use a core message\nslide seriously, but the graphic even re-appears on the conclusion slide--and\nas a logo of colored bubbles on many other slides. It was over-used.\n\nYour other slides reflected solid choices about text, though: Ideas are crisp\nand concisely rendered, and you manage to keep AWC's potential role in\nview.\n\nYour score and grade\n\nIn scoring each group, we weighed substantive argumentation first and\nforemost, considering delivery only to the extent that it related directly to\nyour effectiveness as argument makers (or persuaders). Above, we comment\non style but didn't score it. We considered visuals as an additional element,\nweighing content more heavily than use.\n\nScore: 91 Grade: A-\nPage 2 of 2"
