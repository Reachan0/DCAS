What explains the large differences in economic performance across different countries of different times? What is the role of policy in economic growth?\n\nWhat are the determinants of consumption and saving? How do they matter for both the long run and the short run?\n\nWhy are people unemployed? What should the government do about unemployment?\n\nWhy does macroeconomic activity fluctuate? How do different shocks and policies affect employment, output, investment and consumption over the business cycle?\n\nShould the government try to stabilize the economy against business-cycle fluctuations, and how? Is it better to restrict what the government can do even if it is fully benevolent, or should we give full discretion to the government?\n\nWhat causes financial crises? What is the role of financial markets in the macroeconomy?\n\nWe will shed light on all the above questions. However, do not expect a simple answer to any of these questions--there is no simple answer! Rather, what you should aim for is to develop a framework for studying these questions, along with some empirical guidance. We will review some of the key lessons research in macroeconomics has reached over the years--lessons that will help you understand why certain policy questions remain the topic of hot debate in both the academic and the political arena.\n\nRequirements\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\n5 problems sets\n\n25%\n\nPaper\n\n30%\n\nTwo in-class exams\n\n45%\n\nUnless you had a serious medical problem (e.g., hospitalization), do not expect any exemption or any kind of leniency with regard to deadlines etc. Instead, I will only provide all of you with the following insurance:\n\nFrom the five problem sets, the one with the worst score will not be considered towards your 25% problem-sets part of the grade; only the four best problems will count.\n\nFrom the two in-class exams, the one with the highest score will count for 25%, while the one with the lowest score will count for 20%.\n\nFinally, I would like to encourage class participation: I will give extra points to those students who distinguish themselves in class participation.",

Selection of Countries\n\nThe aim of this paper is to compare and contrast the growth experiences of two different countries.\nSelect two countries for which you think a growth comparison would be interesting.\nRestrict your choice to countries for which the capital stock series are available in the Penn\nWorld Tables (PWT) 5.6. DO NOT CONSIDER THE U.S.\n\n2. Growth Accounting\n\nIdentify the contributions of capital accumulation and productivity growth to growth. Construct the\nSolow residuals using the following equation:\nGrowth in Y/L = alpha*( Growth in K/L ) + Solow Residual\nAssume alpha = 0.35, which is a common estimate for the share of capital.\nMake two plots. The first should compare the growth rates of the two countries. The second should plot\nthe three components of the equation above to see how growth is broken into two components: the part\nthat comes from capital accumulation (building more machines) and the part that comes from\nproductivity improvements.\n\n3. Possible Explanations\n\nCome up with a few fundamental explanations, which explain some of the features of the plots above.\nYou should try to identify differences between the two economies which might generate the divergent\nresults from the growth accounting. We want to see whether you have developed a good economic\nreasoning. So if you present some economic explanations which may be responsible for some of the\nobserved features, this satisfies the purposes of this class.\nThe appropriate framework to think about this exercise is as follows: -\nFundamental differences (e.g. government policy, institutional differences, differences in education\nlevels etc.) -\nMechanical differences (more/less capital accumulation, more/less productivity improvement) -\nDifferential growth experience (more/less growth)\n\nFor example, the countries might differ in their political structure: Communist versus Capitalist.\nIn the communist country there would be lower incentives for technological innovation, which would\nlead to lower productivity growth. You may wish to examine the rewards structure for managers of\nindustrial plants in order to understand their incentives for improving productivity.\nOr you may argue that the monopoly of state-owned enterprises diminished the incentives for creating\nnew products, because inventors of these products would not realize any gains from their inventions. In\naddition, the closed nature of the economy might lead to slower diffusion of ideas within the economy\nand from abroad.\n\nRemember, focus on explanations for differences in growth, not differences in levels. For example, a\nstate-owned monopoly may have an inefficient level of production, but this is a statement about levels.\nYou should examine the implications for productivity growth. There are many potential explanations.\n\nJust pick a few which you think are most responsible for the differences and try to make an economic\nargument that links these explanations to the mechanical observations from the growth accounting part.\nIt is very important to show relevant data and historical evidence that supports your arguments. Marks\nwill be awarded for well-constructed arguments. You must present a clear thesis and line of argument\nto explain the differences in growth.\n\nTopic 2 - Business Cycles\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\n\n1. Selection of Country\nThe aim of this paper is to study and explain the dynamics of consumption, investment and other key\nmacroeconomic variables of a single country, over a long time span. You will have to identify the\ncyclical components of the economy, explain the source of the fluctuations and also the relationship\nbetween the macro aggregates, through the lens of the Real Business Cycle model. Restrict your choice\nto countries for which the capital stock series are available in the Penn World Tables (PWT) 5.6.\nDO NOT CONSIDER THE U.S.\n\n2. Compute long run variables\nAs in Problem set 2, you will have to construct the Solow residuals, and with them construct the long\nrun versions of the key macroeconomic variables: GDP, consumption and investment.\n\n(a) Compute the real, log per capita variables we need. If {yt}is a per capita variable, data\n\nseries, regress\n\nlog(yt) = a + b*t + et\n\nestimating a and b. Then keep the residuals {rt}, calculating:\n\nrt = log(yt) - a -b*t\n\n(b) - Construct the Solow residuals as explained in the lecture notes\n\n(c) - Compute the savings rate s as the average Investment/GDP ratio.\n\n(d) - Assume alpha = 0.35, and you can also set n + δ = 0.025 to build the per capita time series\n\nfor capital kt , GDP yt , consumption ct, and investment it measured in logs.\n\n(e) - Plot the simulated variables together with the observed data, showing the fluctuations\n\nof the data with respect to the theoretical long run aggregates\n\n3. Identify fluctuations and possible explanations\nComment on some of the features of the plots above. Try to identify the sources of the observed\nfluctuations, explaining both the nature of the potential TFP shocks. As in the Growth Accounting\nexercise, we want to test your economic reasoning. Try presenting economic explanations that are\n\nconsistent with the observed fluctuations.\n\nTopics to consider:\n- Sources of fluctuations (macroeconomic shocks, trade accounting, government policy, terms of trade\nfluctuations) - Response of macroeconomic aggregates to the shocks,\nboth in terms of sign (increase/decrease) and\nsize. - Co\n-movements between key macroeconomic variables.\n\nFocus on a particular event (a crisis fluctuation, a boom) and find a potential explanation for its source.\nFor example, a boom could be driven by an increase in exports (driven by favorable terms of trade,\nhigh demand for the country's main tradable goods).\n\nAlso, you can focus your attention to a particular crisis episode, identifying the shocked sector (e.g. a\nfinancial crisis), and give an intuitive explanation of the response of the economy to it, through the lens\nof the RBC model. As explained in the growth exercise guidelines, you must use either journalistic or\nacademic articles to base your explanations and arguments, as well as supporting data (e.g. exports and\nimports, for the export boom example). As before, marks will be awarded for well-constructed\narguments.\n\nFOR BOTH TOPICS:\n\nSOME POINTS TO CONSIDER AS YOU WRITE THE PAPER\n\n1. Research: While it is important to use the PWT as well as your class notes and text in helping to\nwrite your paper, your research should not end there. We expect that all of you will SPEND TIME IN\nTHE LIBRARY looking for further data and non-quantitative evidence in support of your arguments.\nEconlit which indexes and abstracts more than 550 international economic journals is a great starting\npoint for finding relevant articles.\nIt is critically important that in analyzing the results from growth accounting, you appeal to data,\narguments, and perhaps other models that you'll find in library resources. While this sort of research\nprocess may be new to many of you, the good news is that the library has a group of excellent research\nlibrarians whose entire job it is to help you in your quest. Use them! Go visit the library and after trying\nto find resources on you own, tell the librarians what you're looking for and ask them what other\nresources are available that might prove helpful.\n\n2. Thesis: We cannot emphasize this enough. It is imperative that you have an argument and state that\nargument clearly and concisely early on in the paper (i.e in Section 1!!!) For example, for the growth\nexercise, using the Solow model as a lens through which you initially consider the question of how\nyour two countries developed, you must state and then prove WHY you get your growth accounting\nresults\n\n3. Style: Grammar, spelling, proper citation and overall presentation (e.g. page numbers, clearly\ndelineated sections etc.) are all very important. For those of you for whom English is not a first\nlanguage or who simply find writing good prose challenging, please visit the folks at the Writing\n\nCenter (32-081). At the least, consider having a friend whom you think writes well read over your\npaper and make suggestions.\n\n4. An Example: A good example paper: A Comparison of the Growth of Singapore and Hong Kong\nfrom 1970 to 2000, David Seif, The MIT Undergraduate Journal of Economics, Volume II, 2002-2003.\n\n5. Organizing Your Paper:\n\nSection 1: Introduction. In Topic 1 you will have to explain WHY you've chosen your 2 countries,\nhighlight the main results of your growth accounting analysis and offer a CLEAR THESIS\nSTATEMENT as to why you think you got those results. In Topic 2, you have to explain why you\nchose your country, and offer a summary of the particular fluctuation events that you will be focusing\non.\n\nSection 2: Present your data and do the growth accounting (and the simulated data for topic 2). Do not\nre-derive the Solow or the RBC model. Rather, write out the key equations, show how you made your\ncalculations and present your growth accounting results (both for the whole period and subintervals) in\na clear way (think TABLE/GRAPHS!!!)\n\nSection 3: This is the heart of your paper and will certainly be the longest part. You may even divide it\nup into 2 sections if there is some sort of logical break in the way you structure your arguments. Here\nyou will fully flesh out your thesis statement explaining, for example, WHY you got your growth\naccounting results. You may introduce new models or new data in this section. Whatever you do,\nplease remember that this is an economics paper first and foremost and you must make economic\narguments. You must have strong economic reasoning and (to the extent possible) DATA to support\nyour ideas. Of course, some narrative and cohesive interpretation of the data is important as well.\n\nSection 4 or 5: Conclusion. Summarize your key results.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.05 Intermediate Macroeconomics\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Schooling Levels and the Growth of the Four Asian Tigers\nChristian Perez\nApril 2, 2010\nChanges Made Since First Draft\nFollowing Jonathan's suggestions, I made several changes to my rst draft. I included a comparison of the point\n\nestimates from my regression model (regressing the Solow residuals g on growth in human capital levels ( H\nH )) to the\ncorresponding estimates in Acevedo (2008). I also included some possible explanations for the dierence in our estimates.\nThere were several typos in the introductory paragraph spotted by Jonathan; I made sure these were addressed.\nFinally, I added a paragraph describing my reaction to the results for the g and R Solow residual series, discussing why\nthe results did not match my expectations, and comparing my results to another author's analysis of similar Solow residual\nseries.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, the Four Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan)\nexperienced rapid growth and industrialization. These countries transformed from relatively poor, backwater countries\nin the 1960s to highly developed societies by the beginning of the 21st century. Their growth and rise to prominence\nhas inspired much study of this phenomenon, with even President Obama urging education reform towards the South\nKorean model. Despite the recent nancial crisis, their output growth is still positive, though it is signicantly less than\nin previous years. Naturally, one wonders which factors have contributed to their remarkable growth.\nResearchers claim economic freedom, cultural mores, human capital, and many other factors have played a role in\ngrowth, along with the standard factors of capital and labor. Indeed, each Asian Tiger possesses a relatively free market\neconomy and a renowned educated workforce. In this paper, I investigate how schooling levels have contributed to the\neconomic growth of these countries. The main vessel through which I conduct my analysis is the Solow model, both\naugmented with human capital and without it.\nTo this end, I employ two empirical strategies to unravel schooling levels' eects on growth. First, I use the technique\nof growth accounting to calculate Solow residuals for each country. These residuals measure the growth of factors not\nexplicitly modeled in the production function (called total factor productivity or TFP): technology, human capital (in the\nun-augmented model), and other unmeasured sources. I calculate Solow residuals in both versions of the Solow model and\ncompare them. Since the augmented Solow model removes human capital from the Solow residuals, a signicant dierence\nbetween the two types of residuals would indicate that human capital plays a large role in TFP growth. Assuming TFP\ngrowth has a large eect on output growth, we can then link these two causal chains together and conclude that schooling\nlevels have a large eect on output growth.\nNext, I implement Acevedo (2008)'s approach to decompose Solow residuals into human capital and other technological\nproductivity growth. Acevedo employs a standard ordinary least squares regression model with the residuals as the left-\nhand-side variable and schooling levels as the right-hand-side variable. Acevedo's goal is to determine how human capital\nplays a role in the growth of South Korea; I extend some of his results and methodologies to the other Asian Tigers.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the history of the Four Asian Tigers during their period of rapid\ngrowth, Section 3 describes, compares, and contrasts the schooling systems and policies of the Asian Tigers, Section 4\npresents some criticisms and doubts of the Asian Tigers' remarkable growth, Section 5 outlines the empirical strategies\n\nin detail, Section 6 describes the data used to estimate the empirical models, Section 7 presents the results from the\nestimations, and Section 8 concludes.\n2. Historical Outline\nFollowing World War II, all four Asian Tiger countries existed in a state of relative poverty. They each emerged from\nimperial Japanese occupation, which imposed radical changes to their existing sociopolitical systems. Foreign inuence\nand aid in these countries continued in the years following the war.\nSome fared better than others in the postwar period. South Korea endured the Korean War and faced several revolutions\nfollowing it. Taiwan, on the other hand, was blessed with the entire gold reserves of mainland China and experienced\nprofessionals brought by the Kuomintang government.\nBy 1965, Taiwan no longer required American aid as it had\nestablished a solid nancial base. Singapore's postwar period consisted of a slowly emerging separation from the British\nrule and increased racial tensions among its citizens of Chinese and Malaysian descent. Hong Kong experienced a large\ninow of immigrants from mainland China and businesses from Shanghai, and remained under British rule until 1997.\nThis vast pool of cheap labor and economic resources is credited to have aided Hong Kong's growth. In all, the nations\ncould be ranked by economic and political success in the postwar period (roughly up to 1965) as follows: Taiwan, Hong\nKong, Singapore, and South Korea.\nFrom 1965 onwards, all nations grew in global stature and economy. South Korea emphasized an export-oriented\neconomy, particularly in industries where it could gain a competitive advantage such as electronics, ship building, textiles,\ncars, and steel.\nTaiwan remained successful, though it focused on medium-scale businesses whereas its fellow Tigers\ndeveloped large conglomerates. Hong Kong continued to rise upwards as new skyscrapers and businesses emerged in its\nharbor. Singapore focused on developing high-technology industries and established large oil reneries that attracted oil\ncompanies.\nHigh growth continued for these economies into the `90s until the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis (Liu 2008). In 1998,\nHong Kong's GDP growth rate fell to -8.7%, Singapore's growth rate fell to -6.7%, South Korea's growth rate fell to\n-9%, and Taiwan's growth rate fell to 3% (from 5%) (PWT 6.3). Following this, some cast doubt on the validity of these\neconomies' rapid growth and argued that the Asian miracle was always a sham. That the Asian Tigers' ascendance was\nreal and stable was conrmed in the following years as their economies bounced back and relatively high growth continued\n\n(Kim 2007).\nIn recent years, attention has shifted to the rise of the BRIC economies, in particular, China.\nThe Asian Tigers\nnevertheless continue to grow with Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan having GDP growth rates of 7.2%,\n8.9%, 4.7%, and 4.9%, respectively, in 2004 (PWT 6.3). Their inuence in global markets today is undoubted; global\nbrands such as Hong Kong's Star Cruises and Taiwan's Acer are becoming more commonplace around the world. South\nKorea's Hyundai recently came in 87th in Fortune's Global 500, a ranking of the world's 500 largest companies (Fortune\n2009).\n3. Schooling Systems and Policies\nWe wish to determine what role schooling levels have in production; however, schooling is not likely to be homogenous\nacross countries. Perhaps additional years of schooling in , say, the South Korean system would be more benecial than a\nsimilar level of schooling in, say, the Taiwanese system. To get a better sense of the variation in schooling quality across\ncountries (if any signicant variation exists), I examine the history and structure of their schooling systems during the\nsecond half of the twentieth century.\n3.1 Colonial Inuence\nAs previously mentioned, each Asian Tiger was under Japanese colonial rule during World War II. In some ways, this\nwas a blessing in terms of the evolution of education systems in these countries. The Japanese are generally regarded to\nhave established excellent, modern educational facilities and systems for their colonies (Sorensen 1994). The Japanese,\nin turn, sought to emulate the Western educational system and instilled the American six-three-three-four system into\ntheir colonies: six years of elementary school, three years of middle school, three years of high school, and four years of\ncollege (Taiwan Government Information Oce 2010). The Kuomintang government of Taiwan embraced the Japanese\neducational system and proceeded to build a hybrid system that combined traditional mainland Confucian education with\nthe more modern Japanese style (Clark 2002). Compulsory education laws in Taiwan were slowly enacted in the remainder\nof the century with nine years of educations required for children starting in 1968 and twelve years required starting in\n1990 (Clark 2002).\nThe Japanese inuence on education took a less favorable tone in South Korea. Though the Japanese did instill their\n\nmodern schooling system in Korea (not yet North and South), they did so with the goal of keeping Koreans . . . subordinate\nin all ways to ethnic Japanese (Sorensen 1994). In 1942, 40 percent of Koreans were enrolled in elementary school while\nthe institutions for higher learning in Korea mostly enrolled Japanese. After independence and formation in 1948, school\nenrollment for South Koreans began to rapidly increase, with elementary enrollment past 90% by 1964 and high school\nenrollment past 90% by 1979. Compulsory enrollment up to ninth grade was enacted in 1990 (Sorensen 1994).\nThough Hong Kong and Singapore were also Japanese colonies, their schooling systems were more inuenced by the\nBritish education system (NLB 2010, Chan 2008). Since these two countries were British colonies before Japan's imperial\ncampaign and had British educational systems in place, perhaps the Japanese colonialists did not feel the need to install\nWestern-inuenced Japanese schooling systems. They followed the British six-three-two system: six years of elementary,\nthree years of secondary education, and two years of senior secondary (Chan 2008). To the extent that they dier, Singapore\nstruggled to accommodate its racially diverse population (NLB 2010) while Hong Kong divided its educational system into\nAnglo-Chinese schools (taught in English and Chinese), Chinese schools (taught only in Chinese), and National schools\n(expensive international schools were foreign children are taught in English) (Chan 2008). Compulsory schooling laws\ncame into eect for Singapore in 2003; children of ages 6-15 are required to attend a national primary school (Ministry of\nEducation, Singapore 2010). In Hong Kong, nine years of education were made mandatory in 1997 (Hong Kong Education\nBureau 2007).\nIn conclusion, the Four Asian Tigers seem to have had modern, Westernized schooling systems during their periods\nof rapid growth. From their World War II colonial rulers they directly (as in the case of Hong Kong and Singapore)\nor indirectly (as in the case of Taiwan and Korea) inherited attributes of Western schooling systems such as the tiered\nstructure. Perhaps it's that they had these modern systems, as opposed to the more traditional ones found in African\ncountries such as Nigeria, where compulsory schooling has yet to be established (Maps of the World 2009), that allowed\nthem to grow faster than comparable countries following World War II.\n3.2 Regulation, then Decentralization\nA comprehensive study of the history of education systems of the Asian Tigers, Mok (2006) describes how these\ncountries had highly regulated systems. Hong Kong would stress (and still stresses) quality assurance inspections: schools\nare randomly selected and then are rigorously inspected for the fulllment of criteria such as organization and support\nfor pupils. Singapore conducted similar inspections, following a European-based model of quality assurance. In Taiwan,\n\nmodications in teaching materials or curricula needed to be rst approved by the education ministry. Sorensen (1994)\nnotes that, during the period 1963-1979, South Korea became a testocracy where centralized state exams inuenced all\nfacets of education.\nLater in the century, however, the Tigers' education systems became more and more decentralized. Referring again to\nMok (2006), in South Korea, the government's grip on schools relaxed in 1994 when control of student quotas were handed\nover to schools and funding criteria became much less stringent. Taiwan began to introduce market competition among\nschools: researchers at universities now competed for research funds and other incentive mechanisms were designed for\nteachers. Singapore granted more autonomy to schools in order to promote transparency in school performance. Finally,\nHong Kong chose to maintain some control from local school leaders, but worked to encourage their development as\nmanagers.\nThe Four Asian Tigers followed authoritarian rule over their education systems during most of their rapid growth.\nIf such policies were successful, then why did they discontinue them towards the end of the century? Perhaps they had\ngauged that the education sector had matured by the late twentieth century; local provincial or municipal schooling\nsystems were no longer dependent on the government. A relaxing of control during the earlier fragile years could have led\nto a deterioration or collapse of the education system. It would be plausible to think that the aforementioned commitment\nand responsibility of these countries to their citizens' education are the roots of their current highly educated workforces.\n4. Counterarguments to Growth\nThe controversial paper Young (1993) reduces the growth of the Four Asian Tigers to higher quantities of traditional\nobservables: higher investment, labor, and capital (both physical and human capital). Young's ndings suggest that their\ngrowth was driven through factors other than advances in technology, contrary to popular belief. As Krugman (1994)\nputs it, . . . Asian growth has so far been mainly a matter of perspiration rather than inspirationof working harder, not\nsmarter. Appealing to neoclassical growth theory, since the Solow model posits a production function with decreasing\nmarginal productivities in its arguments, we'd expect a slowdown in the Asian Tigers' economies.\nIn relation to this paper's goal, de la Fuente and Domenech (2000) tell of the increasing skepticism to the role of human\ncapital in growth. Researchers nd that human capital variables are insignicant or have the wrong sign in their growth\nregressions, leading them to doubt that it human capital actually has an eect on growth. Thankfully, de la Fuente and\n\nDomenech provide an explanation for this phenomenon: the human capital data are fraught with error. They revise the\nBarro and Lee (1996) dataset on human capital and go on to show that the contribution of TFP to output is signicant.\nIn this paper, I use the Barro and Lee (2001) dataset. Though Barro and Lee (2001) do not reference de la Fuente and\nDomenech (2000)'s methods, they do employ new techniques (since 1996) to address measurement error. A more recent\nproject, Cohen and Soto (2007), further addresses measurement error in schooling levels, proposing an alternative dataset\nto Barro and Lee (2001). Cohen and Soto then go on to nd signicant and positive coecients in their growth regressions.\n5. Empirical Strategies\nTo investigate the role of schooling levels on growth, I take two principal empirical paths; both utilize the technique\nof growth accounting. Growth accounting is technique to decompose the determinants of output growth as determined\nby the researcher's production function. For example, Acemoglu (2009) decomposes the production function F(K, AL)\ninto y = g +\n\nα\nk\nk\nwhere y is output per worker, k is capital per worker, αk is capital's share of output, and g is called\ny\nk\nthe Solow residual. The Solow residual is meant to capture the contribution to output growth of factors not explicitly\nexpressed in the production function such as technological growth, cultural changes, and human capital accumulation,\nthat is, factors in A (called total factor productivity (TFP)). Calculating a series of Solow residuals across time allows\nus to make conjectures about the role of technology or human capital in production: consistent high TFP growth rate\nsupports a hypothesis that these factors can explain a large portion of overall growth.\nFor our purposes, we can create these series for the Asian Tigers and then attempt to extrapolate information about\nschooling levels, but we can do one better. Suppose we modify the production function to include human capital, as in\nAcemoglu (2009): Y (t) = K(t)αH(t)β(A(t)L(t))1-α-β where H denotes human capital. In per worker terms, we then\n\nhave y(t) = k(t)αh(t)βA1-α-β. The growth accounting formula can then be written as y = R + α k + β h, where R is our\ny\nk\nh\nnew Solow residual. As we've included human capital in the production function, the Solow residual no longer captures\nthe eects of human capital on growth in output. My rst strategy is then the following: I compute the Solow residuals\nin the original production function presented above, henceforth g, and then compare them with the new Solow residuals\ncalculated from this new production function, henceforth R. Signicant dierences in the Solow residual trends then\nillustrates the eects of human capital on growth.\nTo calculate the g series, I use the parameter value αk = .35, a value consistently observed in historical data. To\n\ncalculate the R series, I use the parameter values from Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992). There, the authors posit our\nsame augmented production function, F(K, H, AL) = KαHβ(AL)1-α-β, and transform it as follows: log(yj\n∗) = constant-\nα+β log(nj\nog\nα\nβ\n+ g + δ) +\nα\nl\nα\n(sk\nβ\n) +\nβ\nlog\nwhere\n-\n--\n(s )\ns is the fraction of income invested in physical capital, s\nis\n-\n-α-\nh\nk\nh\nβ\nthe fraction invested in human capital, nj is population growth, g is the growth rate of TFP, and δ is the depreciation rate,\nfor country j . The authors assume that g + δ = 0.05 noting that ...changes in this assumption have little eect on the\nestimates. They estimate this equation using log(yj\n∗) = β0 + β1log(\nI\n) + β2log(nj + g + δ\nβ\nGDP\n) +\n3log(SCHOOLj) + εj,\nj\nwhere\nI\nis the average share of gross investment in GDP meant to measure sk (averaged across the years 1960-1985),\nGDP\nSCHOOL is a constructed measure to proxy for sh (also averaged across 1960-1985), and nj is the population growth rate\n(again, averaged across 1960-1985). The coecients β1, β2, and β\nα\n3 estimate\n,\n1-α-β\n-\nα+β , and\nβ\n, respectively;\n1-α-β\n1-α-β\ntheir estimates can be used to derive implied values of α and β . From Table II of the paper, their estimates are αˆ = .31\nand βˆ = .28.\nAs previously mentioned, my second strategy also uses growth accounting. In order to extract the contribution of\n\nhuman capital to TFP, Acevedo (2008) estimates the following regression model: gj,t = β0 + β1( H )j,t + εj,t where gj,t and\nH\n(\nH )j,t are the Solow residuals and growth rate of human capital for country j at time t . He then interprets the estimate\nH\nof the coecient β1 as the eect of human capital growth on TFP growth. This gives us another way to illustrate the\neects of human capital: if β1 is found to be signicantly positive, and since TFP growth contributes to overall increased\nproduction, we can link the two causal chains together and infer that increases in human capital are causally linked to\nincreases in overall production. Following Acevedo, I estimate his model using the Barro and Lee (2001) dataset, which\ncontains schooling levels from 1955-2000 in ve-year intervals.\n6. Data\nAfter an extensive search for data on output per worker, capital per worker, and schooling levels, I could only nd\ndata on these variables from 1962-1990 for all four countries. The variable for which data was most dicult to nd was\ncapital per worker. Some sources such as Hall and Jones (1998) suggested using the perpetual inventory method to create\nthe capital per worker data, but due to lack of expertise and time, I abstained from this path.\nThat said, I used the Penn World Table 5.6 (PWT 5.6) dataset to obtain data on output per worker and capital per\nworker. I considered using the more recent 6.3 release of the Penn World Table data, but it did not contain the capital\n\nper worker series. It should be noted that sources such as Johnson, Larson, Papageorgiou, and Subramanian (2009) raise\nthe issue of measurement error in the Penn World Table data releases. Unfortunately, the 5.6 release does not contain\ncapital per worker series for Singapore; I extract this series from the Easterly and Levine (2001) data, which measures\ncapital per work for Singapore using aggregate investment gures and the aforementioned perpetual inventory method.\nA brief comparison of the calculated values of capital per worker for Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan by Easterly\nand Levine (2001) and the Penn World Table data demonstrates that the Easterly and Levine (2001) gures are almost\nalways about 1,000 to 1,500 points higher. Theoretically, since I use the growth rate of capital per worker, this dierence in\nlevels shouldn't matter in calculating Solow residuals. Furthermore, since the specications that do use the level of capital\nper worker transform K into logs, I apply the same argument as Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992) do to their human\ncapital variable: any proportional gain in capital per worker will be allocated to the constant term in the regression.\nThe schooling level data is obtained from the Barro and Lee (2001) data set. Following Acevedo (2008), I use their\nAverage Years of Schooling variable to account for schooling levels. This variable is compiled in Barro and Lee (2001)\nfrom various sources including the UNESCO data used in Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992). It comes in ve-year intervals\nfrom 1960 2000 for all four countries and in two categories: as a percentage of the total population over 15 years and as\na percentage of the total population over 25 years. Following Acevedo (2008), I use the data of the total population over\n15 years of age.\nData on output per worker and capital per worker is annual while the schooling level data comes in ve-year intervals.\nAcevedo (2008) imputes the average years of schooling data for years between the ve-year measurements by ...assuming\nlinear growth rates. He does not specify his procedure, but I follow his intentions by a connect-the-dots algorithm:\nI connect the values of two adjacent measurement years, say, 1950 and 1955, with a line and impute the values for the\nin-between years, 1951, 1952, 1953, and 1954, with their corresponding values on the line. A more formal procedure is\ndescribed in the appendix.\n7. Results\nThe Solow residual series for each country are shown below.\n\nAs the two types of residuals hardly dier for each country, these series show mild evidence for the importance of\nhuman capital in TFP growth. As expected, the R residual series are mostly near or below the g residual series; only\nSingapore deviates from this trend in the years 1975-1980. South Korea and Taiwan are the only countries where the R\nresiduals are consistently below the g residual series. Hong Kong and Singapore show little notable separation of the R and\ng series with the exception of the years 1976-1982 for Hong Kong and 1981-1990 for Singapore (and the aforementioned\n'pathological' interval 1975-1980 for Singapore). The residuals taken as a whole mostly positive, another result to at least\nconrm the correctness of our specications. The major deviants to this trend are South Korea and Taiwan, whom have\neight or more years in which the residuals are zero or negative. These results support Young (1993)'s nding that South\nKorea and Taiwan are the Tigers with the second lowest and lowest TFP growth over the years 1970-1985, respectively.\nYoung also nds that Hong Kong is the Tiger with the highest TFP growth rate; given that Taiwan only has four years\n\nwith negative TFP growth as opposed to Hong Kong's six, the results seem to suggest that Taiwan had the highest TFP\ngrowth rate. There are notable spikes in the residual series: South Korea in 1979-1981, Hong Kong in 1965-1967, and\nTaiwan in 1973-1974. South Korea's spike can be explained by the oil shock of 1979, which caused crop failure, and the\nassasination of President Park Chung-Hee in October 1979 (Lee 1996). Lee notes that ...for the rst time since 1957,\n[South] Korea faced a negative GDP growth rate of -2.7 percent... I have yet to nd possible sources of explanation for\nthe Hong Kong and Taiwan spikes.\nWe can consider the region as a whole by averaging residuals across countries in each year. The country-averaged\nresiduals are shown below.\nAgain, the R and g residual series hardly dier. The R series is now always below the g series; unless we believe that\nH does not enter the production function, as opposed to Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992), this result at least conrms\nthat our specications were correct. We now turn to statistical t-tests to compare the means of the residuals across time\nfor each country. The results are shown below.\n\nIn each t-test, the null hypothesis is H0 : gj = Rj where gj is the average of the g residuals across the years 1962-1990\nfor country j.\nEach t-statistic is below 1.645 in absolute value; thus we can't reject the null hypothesis at the 10%\nsignicance level, much less at the standard 5% signicance level. There is again no evidence to support the claim that\nthe R and g residuals dier, which is evidence against the hypothesis that schooling levels have a signicant contribution\nto TFP growth. As previously mentioned, we can link the causal chains connecting schooling levels to growth in output\nand conclude that schooling levels do not have a signicant contribution to overall output growth assuming TFP growth\nhas a signicant contribution to output growth. This assumption is questioned in Young (1993) whose ndings are in turn\nquestioned by Hsieh (2002).\nThat the R and g series do not dier by much was surprising to me. After augmenting the Solow model with human\ncapital, Mankiw, Romer, Weil (1992) obtain better estimates of their structural parameters.\nThis suggests that the\naugmentation signicantly changes any estimates (for better or worse) derived from the original Solow model. Yet my\n\nresults suggest that this augmentation does not cause any notable changes. Valdes (1999) mentions that the size of the\nSolow residuals \"...would diminish if we used the \"broad concept\" of capital, thus including under K [capital] human as\nwell as physical capital.\" Thus, in this context, we should have that the R series be notably smaller than the g series.\nAlas, they hardly deviate from each other.\nMy estimation of Acevedo (2008)'s regression yields the following results.\n(1)\nVARIABLES\ng\nH\nH\n-0.214\n(0.199)\nConstant\n0.0339***\n(0.00659)\nObservations\nR-squared\n0.008\nRobust standard errors in parentheses\n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1\n\nI get βˆ1 = -.214 as the coecient on ( H ). Normally this would indicate the paradoxical nding that increased growth\nH\nn schooling levels leads to lower TFP growth. Alas, the heteroscedasticity-robust standard error on the coecient is .199\niving us a p-value of .284. Thus we cannot reject the null hypothesis H0 : β1 = 0 at the 10% signicance level, much\ness at the standard 5% signicance level. These results are in stark contrast to Acevedo (2008)'s estimate of βˆ1 = .5383,\nhich is statistically signicant at the 5% level. Recall, however, that he only looks at South Korea and compiles his nal\nataset from several dierent sources.\nThe regression results are similar to the results from the comparison of the g and R series: schooling levels do not\neem to have a signicant contribution to TFP growth, and, assuming TFP growth plays a major role in output growth,\nn overall production.\ni\ng\nl\nw\nd\ns\no\n\n8. Conclusion\nDespite the setback during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the Four Asian Tigers continue to grow. In the past couple\nof years, their growth has slowed, but this seems to be due to the recent global nancial crisis rather than idiosyncratic\nreasons. Their emergence from the current slowdown will be intriguing; will Young (1993)'s claim of factor accumulation\ncatch up with some of the Tigers and stie their growth? We should take Young's results with a grain a salt as Barro\n(1998) has indicated. There, Barro analyzes Young (1993)'s arguments and calculations, concluding that most approaches\nto measure the contribution TFP growth to output growth, including Young's, systematically yield estimates that are\nbiased downwards. Updated approaches such as Hsieh (2002)'s aim to remove this systematic bias.\nI've presented evidence against the hypothesis that schooling levels explain a considerable fraction of growth in output.\nThis result goes against those found in de la Fuente and Domenech (2000) and Cohen and Soto (2007). Seeing as I've\nemployed reasonable empirical strategies, this seems to suggest that measurement error in schooling levels still persists in\nBarro and Lee (2001)'s dataset. An extension to this paper would utilize alternative datasets, such as de la Fuente and\nDomenech (2000)'s and Cohen and Soto (2007)'s, that correct for this error. Furthermore, I would also attempt to acquire\nand use an updated series on capital per worker seeing as that variable is also known to be measured with error.\nAppendix\nThis section explains the connect the dots procedure for calculating the Average Years of Schooling values for years\nin between the ve-year intervals in which the data from Barro and Lee (2001) come in. If st0 and st5 denote two adjacent\nvalues of Average Years of Schooling, and t1, t2, t3, and t4 denote the in-between years, then st1 = st0 + (1/5)(st5 -st0)\n, st2 = st0 + (2/5)(st5 -st0) , st3 = st0 + (3/5)(st5 -st0) , and st4 = st0 + (4/5)(st5 -st0) . As an example, if s1950\nand s1955 denote the values for Average Years of Schooling in 1950 and 1955, I assign to 1951 s\n= s\n1950 + s1955-s\n,\ns1952 = s1950 + s1955-s1950 to 1952, and so on.\nReferences\nAcevedo, Sebastian, Measuring the Impact of Human Capital on the Economic Growth of South Korea, The Journal\nof the Korean Economy, Vol. 9, No.1, April 2008, 113-139.\n\nBarro, Robert J. \"The East Asian Tigers Have Plenty to Roar About.\" Business Week 27 Apr. 1998: 24.

      "content": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThe Effect of Anti-Gang Measures on Wealth in Central American Countries\nChanges: For the revision I broadened my data pool. I attempted to include several controls not\ncorrelated with direct effects on the policy. I also observed several additional statistics looking for\neffects on international perception (FDI and tourism) as well as education and employment stats. I then\nadded a comparison to Guatemala which I found to be the best single country control for El Salvador.\nThe meaning of the lambda statistic was better addressed as was the reason for choosing El Salvador\nand the channel through which gangs affect the economy. Disaggregate data was not found.\n\nI. Introduction\nAlthough countries in Central America share a common history and geography, there are wide\nvariations in GDP per capita and GDP growth throughout the region. In an attempt to see the effects of\nspecific changes in Anti-Gang Policies on GDP growth across countries, this paper analyzes the effect of\n\"Mano Dura\", an anti-gang and drug-trafficking policy in El Salvador. Pre and post implementation data\nwere run through a discontinuity regression model in order to analyze the immediate and longer term\neffects of the policy on criminal, wealth and poverty statistics. These results were then compared to the\naverage effect across the rest of Central America and specifically to Guatemala, which was following a\nsimilar track as El Salvador before 2004.\nI found that although the effect of the policy on homicide appears to be consistent with\nprevious papers, which report that increased policing of gangs initially provides incentive for competing\ngangs to fight for territory (Rios 2011), the immediate increase in homicides was found to be statistically\ninsignificant. However, the change in homicide rate over time out performed the rest of Central\nAmerica, which may indicate the effective settling of violence as a result of the policy. This result was\nthen reversed in the comparison to Guatemala alone. It is difficult to determine whether all of Central\nAmerica or just Guatemala serves as a better control.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nI also found an ambiguous immediate effect on wealth and poverty indicators. The lack of a\nwealth effect is not surprising seeing as changes in growth tend to occur over time. Any discontinuity in\nthe future due to this policy is also difficult to measure due to the presence of the recession. No real\nsignificant changes in Investment, tourism or openness were observed. The poverty statistics showed a\nsignificant change towards an increasing poverty level, but an insignificant change in the GINI wealth\ninequality indicator. This may show that anti-gang policy singles out less wealthy individuals while\nproviding infrastructure for growth in the middle class. Many factors may contribute to the insignificant\nimmediate effects of the Mano Dura legislation, which are addressed in later sections.\nThe long term results must also be analyzed further due to the possibility of spillover effects.\nThough, with the assumption that Central America is strategically centered, so that its relation to the\ndrug trade and economic tides fluctuate similarly across the region, the policy implementation appears\nto have tempered negative long term effects. One of the main difficulties in assessing this result is the\npossibility that violence increased outside of El Salvador due to spillover effects meaning that the policy\ndidn't have a net benefit in the broader region. The use of Guatemala as a control seems to counter this\nview as well as the positive observations on El Salvador. With Central America as the control and looking\nspecifically at El Salvador we may still conclude that attempts to curb gang prevalence as measured by\nthe homicide rate improves wealth statistics over time.\nThe following section provides background about the alarming statistics of the drug trade, its\nimportance to the United States, and about the specific policy being addressed. Section III describes the\ndiscontinuity model and difference in differences t-test used in this paper. Section IV highlights the\nimportant findings from the models. Section V provides possible explanations for the results. Section VI\nwill sum up the key findings and the points to take away.\nII. Background\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThe countries of Central America: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,\nNicaragua and Panama, have a deeply integrated history and economy. However, since attempts at\ngoverning this area under the control of a united government failed in the 19th century, the relative\nwealth of these economies has diverged. I aim to assess whether this divergence in wealth can be at\nleast partially attributed to the emergence of the drug trade, which has been correlated with violence,\ncorruption and negative economic consequences (Seelke, Wyler, and Beittel , 2010). With this in mind, I\nlook at the effect of specific legislation aimed at reducing gangs related to drug trafficking.\nCentral America is now proving to be a battle ground for a burgeoning drug trade. The\nWashington Post states that one third of the total mass of cocaine flows through Honduras alone (Miroff\n2011), which, according to the World Bank, also suffers a homicide rate of 82.1 per 100,000 inhabitants,\nthe highest in the world. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the homicide rate\nin Central America is second only to Southern African when comparing global subregions. Although, the\nprevalence of violence isn't solely in response to drug trafficking, the 2011 Global Study on Homicides\nreported that the increase in homicide rate is correlated with an overall increase in drug flow through\nCentral America. These statistics are complicated by the fact that violence is typically between\ncompeting gangs and sparks when \"the status quo\" is affected. This suggests periods of lower drug flow\nmay lead to increase competition among gangs. This, however, is primarily in well established grounds\nsuch as Mexico, therefore violence in Central America is more positively related to gang violence due to\nincreased drug trafficking.\nThe largest sources of gangs in Latin America are from Mexican and Colombian based trade,\nwhich handle between $18 and $39 billion in \"drug proceeds\" (Seelke 2010). The largest consumer of\ndrugs from Colombia and Mexico is the United States, which has a wholesale market for drugs estimated\nat $16billion (Guerrero 2011). Although these numbers can only be seen as estimates due to the\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\ndifficulty in tracing the drug trade, they give a staggering portrait of the economic incentives and the\nimportance with which the United States should view the alarming trends in Central America, which are\ndue, in large part, to the negative externalities of U.S. consumption. It is important for the United States\nto continue to work with Central American countries to observe effective policy strategies which may\ncounteract the current trends.\nPrevious policies in South America have shown the difficulty in effective policy making. Attempts\nto curb production in Colombia have been shown to simply divert production to neighboring states,\nnamely Peru (Leech 2010). Another problem for policy making is avoiding negatively affecting lower\nincome groups. As also discussed by Leech, drug related crops have a much higher yield to poor farmers\nthan legal cash crops. Policies of eradication and the like have proven to create turmoil outside of the\nmore traditional criminal personalities. To that effect it is necessary to demonstrate positive economic\nincentives.\nThe effects of gangs on the economy are related to their overall effect on infrastructure, actual\nand perceived. Gangs often lead to corruption as mentioned above and an overall increased level of\ncrime. Drug trafficking can even lead to political instability as witnessed in Honduras with the ousting of\npresident Zelaya. In this state investors may be very unwilling to engage in transactions. Also the\npresence of staggering homicide statistics and the like may be enough to discourage businesses from\nstarting plants in the region. Decreased investment and long term savings slow growth and reduce\noutput. Motions to restore confidence in the economy and overall order in the country should improve\nlong term growth through investment channels alone.\nTo that effect, this paper aims to address the direct economic effects of a strict anti-gang\nprogram on drug trafficking and wealth statistics. Many different policies came to mind in order to study\nthis effect, but limitations on data made most of them difficult to observe. The Merida initiative was\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nsigned into law by the United States in 2008. It provides $1.6 billion for counter trafficking measures.\nThis policy is especially convenient in that you would be able to compare the effect for several countries,\nwhich would increase the validity of the measurement. However, the Merida initiative is too recent to\naccurately measure changes in wealth indicators especially because the payments are paid out over\ntime and are spent on new equipment and training, which aren't immediately effective.\nI will be analyzing the El Salvadorian legislation called Mano Dura, which was implemented in\n2003. El Salvador is a strong model country because of its relatively small size and its large initial crime\nrate. This should make effects on homicide and wealth more pronounced because of the large room for\nimprovement in crime and the low level of other economic factors which may dilute any observed\neffects. Although this specific policy has been heavily criticized for its apparent human rights violations\nand its reverse long term effects of uniting gangs in the prison system, this policy has the advantages\nthat it only affects gang prevalence, there is sufficient data around the time period for both wealth and\ndrug statistics, and the policy essentially flipped a switch allowing police to arrest anyone who may be\nsuspected of gang association. The last reason creates the possibility of doing a linear regression\ndiscontinuity model. Also, since the policy is country specific, we are able to determine long term effects\nby comparison across countries in Central America and against Guatemala.\n\nIII. The Model\n\nIn this study I aim to describe the overall effectiveness of government policies against gangs and\ndrug trafficking by looking specifically at the Mano Dura legislation in El Salvador. In order to find the\nimmediate effects of the Mano Dura policy, I employed a linear regression discontinuity design. The\nequation used was of the form\n\nY = α*YEAR + β*(Post 2003) + λ*(Post 2003)*YEAR + ε\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nwhere Y was the independent variable either: GDP per Capita, GDP growth, homicides, cocaine seizures,\nGINI and the % below national poverty line. Post 2003 is a dummy variable which captures the policy\nimplementation in the year 2003. The slope is allowed to change after the policy implementation. The\nchange in slope is captured in the variable λ, which is an interaction term that captures the effect of the\npolicy over time. This statistic is used later on to compute the longer term effect of the policy. The\ndiscontinuity is measured by computing λ*2004 + β. The switch was chosen to be 2004 so as to capture\nthe initial effect of the policy in the coefficient of the dummy variable. The policy initiated \"police-\nmilitary patrols\" and \"permitted the arrest of suspected gang members on the basis of their physical\nappearance alone\" (Wolf 2012). The subsequent legislation should have a weaker effect due to the\npresence of the initial creation of anti-gang laws, which went into effect, albeit controversially,\nimmediately.\n\nThe wealth statistics investigated in this study are assumed to move more slowly than the\nhomicide rate. The propagation would occur throughout time. Being unable to estimate in what period\nthe effects are likely to take place and noting that the effect might be spread over time, the second part\nof the analysis was dedicated to viewing the long term change in trends associated with the policy. The\nunderlying assumption is that trends in drug trafficking were changing across this period of time for all\nof Central America. With this in mind, I applied the model used above to every Central American country\nin order to calculate λ, the interaction term, for homicide rates and GDP growth. The interaction can be\nseen as the developing trend in these statistics at the time under inspection. For instance, since overall\nhomicide rates increased more rapidly during the second half of the decade we expect the average λ to\nbe positive.\nThe average for Central America is estimated as a control due to its location between cocaine\nproducers, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, and consumers, The United States. The geographical location\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nimplies that macroscopically there is no choice, but to go through Central America. Central America has\nalso historically moved concertedly in terms of changes in growth as evidenced in the paper \"Economic\nGrowth and Integration in Central America\" (Desruelle 2007). Both of these statements suggest that the\naverage of the remaining Central American countries may act as a control for El Salvador without the\npolicy intervention. The analysis incorporates a t-test to evaluate if there was a significant change in the\ntrend for homicide rates and GDP growth between El Salvador and the remainder of Central America.\n\nLooking more closely for a direct control, I applied these models to the other countries in\nCentral America looking for a country that had similar trends as El Salvador up to 2004. Guatemala\nseemed to meet this requirement and was also favored because it borders El Salvador. Any spillover\neffects should then be heightened for Guatemala leading to an overestimate of the effect of the policy\non drug trafficking statistics if there is one.\n\nIV. The Data\n\nThe data was taken from the World Bank except for the statistics on Seizures which was taken\nfrom the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's World Drug Report for 2011 and 2005. The first\nexpectation of the policy was for there to be a direct effect on gang and Drug trafficking statistics. Below\nare the discontinuity regression graphs for drug seizures and homicide rates\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nFor the homicide rate the regression was measured after the year 1998. The high murder rate before\nthis period is residual effects of the Civil War which took place earlier in the decade. Only viewing the\narea after a stable growth rate is established allows a better view of the policy change in the desired\ntime period. Using the method above we find a discontinuity of 4.745144 homicides per 100,000\ninhabitants, but this value is statistically insignificant due to the high p-value. The limitation of only\nhaving yearly data makes it difficult to determine significant values for graphs with low slopes.\n\nThe scatter plot of the cocaine seizure rate shows one of the difficulties of using this as an\naccurate measure of drug trafficking on a microscopic level. The weight of seizures is highly variable and\ndepends on chance. That being said there appears to be a relatively significant (90% confidence) change\nin slope and intercept at the year of the policy intervention. The calculated discontinuity is -821.0468 kg,\nwhich may indicate a change in priorities for the police after the anti gang laws came into effect.\n\nThe following graphs show the wealth and poverty statistics measured\nCocaine\nSeizures\n(kg)\nCoefficient\nStandard\nerror\nt\nP>|t|\nYear\n486.7909\n67.5991\n7.20\n0.000\nPost*Year\n-583.6617\n297.8429\n-1.96\n0.082\nPost\n597643.4\n1.96\n0.082\nconstant\n-983015\n135291.9\n-7.19\n0.000\nHomicides\nCoefficient\nStandard\nerror\nt\nP>|t|\nYear\n-.760535\n1.57264\n-.48\n.640\nPost*Year\n1.060536\n1.84482\n.57\n.579\nPost\n-2120.569\n3693.024\n-.57\n.580\nconstant\n1581.012\n3146.169\n.50\n.627\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nIn the case of wealth and poverty ratings, we see ambiguous effects of the policy.

Analysis\n\nThe data seem to support the conclusion that although many of the statistics show varying\neffects around the period of the intervention, there were few statistically significant immediate effects\nassociated with the implementation of the Mano Dura policy in El Salvador. Most concerning is the\nchange in slope of the headcount poverty rate which significantly increased around the policy\nintervention. The results of the t-test show that El Salvador performed better in the measured statistics\nof homicide rate and GDP growth across the implementation period, but due to several difficulties\nencountered in this study it's difficult to connect this directly to the policy. These improved results are\nalso lost when directly compared to Guatemala, a neighboring country following a similar track at the\ntime of the intervention.\n\nThe largest difficulties in this study can be separated into the problems within El Salvador and its\nrelation with Central America as a whole. One of the problems in a study like this is that it is difficult to\ndetermine the credibility of the policy itself. In a more complete study, I would try to evaluate statistics\nthat speak to this criticism. Its occurrence around an election year presents the possibility that there was\nlittle incentive to enforce this act after it was passed. However, the presence of an addition to the policy\nafter the election, Super Mano Dura, suggests that this was not the case. One might also argue that El\nSalvador simply didn't have the resources necessary to successfully implement the policy or that the\npolice force could have been incentivized not to put the policy into full force. This argument is more\ndifficult to counter. By looking at the seizure rates, it appears there may have been a trend away from\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nlooking for drugs. If this was correlated with an increase in incarceration rates, then the change in\nseizure rates would represent a shift in priority and therefore the active participation of the police force.\nI found it difficult to find a significant number of data points for incarceration rates in El Salvador. As it\nstands, it is difficult especially due to the chance nature of cocaine seizures to make this extrapolation.\n\nAlong with the issues within El Salvador as far as being able to implement the policy are the\nresults of the wealth statistics. The counterintuitive results of the wealth inequality measures are\ndifficult to interpret. The statistic\n\nincreases significantly although the GINI equality of\nwealth indicator appears to decrease over this period of time. The change in the headcount poverty % is\nespecially concerning given the appearance of revolts in Peru from crop eradication policies. It is\nimportant to note that the increase in the poverty rate occurred before the global financial crisis, and,\nmore importantly, before the GDP growth rate began to decrease.\nOne can explain this effect if police are naturally biased to assume that individuals who look less\nwealthy are more likely to be associated with gangs, the policy may have directly made it more difficult\nfor lower class individuals to stay above the poverty line. Another possibility takes into account that the\nmajority of gang members take a very small share of profits as shown by Levit (2000). If the poverty line\nis below the average wage of a \"foot soldier\" in a gang then successful gang dismembering could\nnaturally lead to an increase in the poverty rate. This implies that a high percentage of the target group\nis probably near the poverty line and may suffer from a drop in profits. More generally, gang eradication\neliminates a general source of revenue.\n\nOn the other hand Pool and Bollen's (2009) analysis of hedge fund managers shows that given\nproper incentive people naturally tend to misrepresent certain statistics if it is convenient to do so. In\nthis case, it is possible that the presence of potential external aid may have created a drive to overstate\nthe need for help without a higher rate of inequality. This may also explain how the slope of the per\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\ncapita income also increased over this period of time while poverty rates increased. It also happens that\nfunding from the United States was passed only 4 years after the intervention period through the\nMerida Initiative.\n\nOverall, we would expect an increase in long term production in the economy due to a more\npositive \"atmosphere for doing business\". Elimination of gang and drug trafficking organization are\nthought to decrease corruption and improve market conditions as well as increase confidence, which\nmay increase domestic and foreign investment. Foreign direct investment was not significantly affected\nby the policy, nor was tourism, which could be seen as a different kind of confidence indicator. However\nit is possible that analyze those statistic along with GDP in El Salvador alone are made more difficult due\nto the presence of the global financial crisis. This is one of the reasons that cross country inspection was\nundertaken.\n\nFrom the difference in differences model using the t-test, we see that, with 90% confidence, El\nSalvador was able to curb homicide trends occurring across Central America during this time period. It\nalso performed better in the trend for GDP growth. In looking at these statistics however it is necessary\nto observe the limitation in this model. One of the biggest problems is described by Melissa Dell's (2011)\npaper on trafficking networks. This paper describes the spillover effects of anti drug trade policy on\nneighboring counties. A possible criticism for this paper is that the policy in El Salvador may have\nnegative consequences for the surrounding areas. This has two large implications. First, the effect of spill\nover due to the policy will inflate the change in the homicide statistic. This would violate one of the\nassumptions that the rest of Central America can be seen as a control for El Salvador because it would\nalso be affected by the policy. Second, If drug trafficking is merely rerouted outside of El Salvador then\nthe benefits accrued in El Salvador would simply be hurting the surrounding countries. Both of these\nperspectives suggest that any benefits found would be overstated.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nOn the other hand, the same effect could be seen in the reverse. That is to say any policy\nundertaken by neighboring countries could have an effect on the statistics measured for El Salvador. In\norder to accept the analysis of long term effects found in this paper, it is necessary that all countries in\nCentral America were combating the drug trade at roughly the same level. This would say that the\nlegislation passed in El Salvador was above and beyond the same level of gang control across Central\nAmerica. The number of articles assessing the severity of this policy and its human rights violations may\nactually be an argument for why this policy is still an effective instrument. The more drastic this law is\ncompared to average tactics the more we can extrapolate from the results. A more exact way of\nremoving the effect of spillovers would be to observe a policy enacted in every country such as the\nfunding from the Merida initiative, but this eliminates the opportunity for a control group at all.\n\nAside from the spillover effect making it difficult to create an effective control group for El\nSalvador, there are the normal concerns of confounding variables affecting the results. A host of\nvariables not described in this paper could have made the economy more stable over the period of the\nrecession aside from the improvements in infrastructure associated with a reduction in corruption\nstemming from the presence of gangs and drug trafficking. We attempted to counter this by the method\nof difference in difference and the use of several controls. One of the reasons I didn't simply want to\nlook at the final values of GDP growth or even just the final slope is that these don't directly capture the\neffect of the policy. If the homicide rate was already growing disproportionately in an area, you wouldn't\nexpect the post policy rates to be comparable to an area with a lower initial growth in homicide rate. By\nchecking the difference in slopes before and after, I attempt to disclose a trend change which should be\nindependent of all but a few other variables, which aren't likely to change across this period of time.\nVariables that do change in this period are accounted for by averaging the broad changes across Central\nAmerica, which is reasonable due to the precedence of concerted changes in growth.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nDepending on which effect the spillover or the stabilization of confounding variables by the\ndifference in differences set up dominates, we may conclude that the results from that particular test\nare the most telling. The results indicate that there is in fact a positive effect on wealth statistics due to\ncounter gang policies as quantified by long term change in homicide statistics. The insignificant\ndiscontinuity most likely due to the small number of data points, makes it difficult to estimate a value\nfor the homicide elasticity of wealth.\n\nThe effects of spillovers should be most notably addressed in the Guatemala vs. El Salvador\ncomparison. However this study showed no significant effect from the policy for either country, and if\nthere was any, Guatemala seemed to outperform El Salvador. This strongly contradicts our data from\nthe Central American comparison. It is hard to say, which one is more valid. The early resemblance\nbetween El Salvador and Guatemala means Guatemala could be a much more effective control. It had a\nrelatively steady and relatively high homicide rate like El Salvador as well as a similar curve for GDP\ngrowth. However if I failed to take into account a confounding variable which isn't correlated with drug\ntrafficking statistics, it is possible that the effect would e much larger for the single country comparison.\n\nThis being said if we accept the findings from the composite comparison, the overall positive\ncorrelation between curbing homicide rates and increasing growth rates ultimately suggests a possible\nexplanation for the divergence in wealth amongst these countries. Although they seem to fluctuate\nconcertedly some countries have benefited more than others historically. The ability to change growth\nvia anti-gang measures shows that these economies are exposed to flaws in infrastructure correlated\nwith gangs. If these differences were reduced, we would expect greater convergence in growth rates in\nthe region as specific crime rates are variable.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThe staggering growth in homicide rate across Central America now has governments\nscrambling to evaluate the proper implementation of anti-gang and drug-trafficking policies. Policy\nmakers must take into account the effect on crime; the effect on poverty statistics where less wealthy\nindividuals dependent on gang and drug trafficking income have been shown to revolt; and the effect on\noverall wealth with the assumption that improving infrastructure and investment incentive should\nincrease growth.\nIn this study I found that the long term trends in GDP growth and homicide rates in El Salvador\noutperformed those of the rest of Central America around the period of the policy implementation.\nHowever when compared to a neighboring country in a similar initial state, El Salvador performed worse\nalthough the statistical significance of the difference is uncertain. The immediate impact was statistically\ninsignificant for a host of possible reasons alluded to and especially the small number of data points.\nHowever, the picture follows our hypothesis that the initial policy intervention would move forces away\nfrom seizures and create more conflict early on and settle down later. Also the poverty and wealth\nstatistics showed varying effects of the policy, which may be cleared up with more data or may indicate\na more positive effect for the middle class versus the lower class over time. This suggests that policy\naimed at targeting gangs may have a more general target of the lower class. At the same time there is\nincreased employment. If we combine the increased poverty, employment and decreased gross\nenrolment, it is possible that youth are being forced to enter the work force. Those demographics may\nbe addressed in a future study. Throughout this paper it has become apparent that the presence of\nspillover effects and confounding variables make this experiment difficult to analyze given data\nconstraints. As data comes out from the Merida Initiative, a similar study comparing its effect on each\nindividual country in Central America may be very insightful.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nOverall, we see the possible implications looking historically at how these economies may have\ndiverged over time as previously stated. With concerted efforts to eliminate criminal interference it is\npossible that countries such as Honduras, which suffers the highest homicide rate in the region and the\nsecond lowest GDP per capita, may make strides in decreasing these gaps.\nI want to make clear that this paper does not attempt to suggest that policies such as the Mano\nDura are the right choice for the region. The effect of incarceration of gang members may lead to\nincreases in gang structure and long term negative consequences. I simply use the policy for its expected\nimpact after being enacted.\n\nVII.

In regards to development economics\nthese theories are particularly important, because understanding factors that influence\ngrowth can lead to policies aimed at helping poor countries bolster the growth of their\neconomies. Similarly, well specified models can help economists better understand the\nseemingly miraculous and sustained growth experienced by countries in the Far East in\nthe last four decades. Additionally these theories can help U.S. policy makers understand\nthe relationship between certain government policies and economic health in the United\nStates.\n\nSince the election of 2008, United States' domestic policy has shifted toward\nincreased government involvement in the private sector. Beginning with the\nunprecedented government bailouts during the recent financial crisis, policymakers in\nWashington have focused on increasing the government's role in banking, education, and\nmost notably, healthcare. While policymakers work to implement their agendas, it is\nbeneficial to look at how government regulation and spending in private industry will\nultimately affect output and economic growth overtime.\nApplications of the Solow and the Neoclassical growth models are two of the\nmost common approaches econometricians take in building an empirical growth model.\nEconomists across the country are constantly running regressions using as many\nspecifications as there are countries to observe (Durlauf et al, 2001) with the intention of\nrelating everything from policies, environmental characteristics, and political changes to\neconomic growth. With the topic of nationalized healthcare consistently in the news, the\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 3\ngoal of this analysis is to gain better insight into whether healthcare regulation, and\nsubsequently healthcare spending by the government, acts as a hindrance or as a catalyst\nfor economic growth. Thanks in part to the emphasis on variable specification within the\nfield of growth econometrics there exists many baseline regressors upon which to build a\nunique model specifying healthcare regulation as one of the determinants of economic\ngrowth.\n\nBasic observations of economic growth have led to two major questions in the\nempirical analysis of growth models. The first is whether or not there exists convergence,\nand the second that we have focused on is what determines differences in growth between\ncountries over time. Specifically, we focus on one aspect of government spending in the\nrealm of healthcare, to address the relationship between growth in economic output and\nwhat has become a topical and polarizing issue in the U.S. In specifying a model to\ndetermine factors that contribute to growth, we looked at a baseline neoclassical growth\nmodel, from which, according to Durflau et al (2005), all empirical growth exercises are\nderived. Our basic model looked at how the growth, Y of economy i at time t was\ninfluenced by several baseline factors. To extend our model to incorporate the effects of\nhealthcare reform on the growth of an economy, we created variables to act as proxies for\ngovernment involvement in healthcare. These included government spending on\nhealthcare, both at an aggregate level per capita (ppp) and as a percentage of GDP, and\ngovernment spending on healthcare as a percentage of total spending on healthcare.\n\nBased on economic theory and from empirical analyses stemming from Barro\n(1991), which used a large cross-section of rich and poor countries, we expected to find\nstrong empirical evidence that large government programs, and in this case healthcare,\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 4\nhave a significant negative correlation with economic output. Beginning with a baseline\nregressions, where we tested the assumptions of Barro et al, we observed relationships\nbetween different factors of government spending and growth in GDP which were in line\nwith economic intuition, and previous work done in growth econometrics. After\nextending the model to incorporate proxies for healthcare regulation, we found in both\nOECD and non-OECD countries that high levels of healthcare regulation are both\nsignificantly and negatively correlated with growth in GDP.\n\nThe following section provides a literature review focusing on previous\nspecifications of economic growth models and earlier research into the affect of\ngovernment spending on output. The third and fourth sections contain an overview of the\nsources and data collected for this study, the design of variables used to represent\nhealthcare regulation and government spending, as well as a detailed description of the\nanalytical methods. In the fifth section we analyze the results from a series of cross-\ncountry regressions. The final section discusses the implications of these results, areas of\nfurther interest, as well as limitations and possible improvements to the model.\n\nI. Previous Literature\n\nMuch of the literature we looked at for this analysis focused on extending a baseline\nspecification of growth regressions to explore a deeper question. Durlauf et al (2001)\ndiscuss how basic growth dynamics can be translated into a simple regression relating\nchange in growth, specific by country to several determining factors stemming from the\nSolow and Neoclassical growth models. Additionally, Durlauf et al (2001) discuss the\nmultitude of different variables economists have used to specify different characteristics\nthat influence economic growth, often referencing the Barro regressions, which were\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 5\npublished in a series of papers beginning in 1989 as the baseline set of characteristics or\n\"work horse\" model many economists include in their analyses.\nBarro and Wolfe (1989), Barro (1991) and Barro and Lee (1994) provide much of the\nframework for the baseline growth regressions found in recent empirical analyses on\ngrowth. These papers divide determinants of growth into five categories, proxies for\nwhich are included in their regressions. The categories of growth highlighted in the\nBarro regressions include first an effect stemming from conditional convergence, where a\ncountry's growth rate is influenced by initial levels of GDP per capita. Secondly, Barro\nrelates growth to measures of investment in human capital, i.e. to proxies for education\nand public health. In the third category, Barro and Lee (1994) discuss the effect of a high\nratio of public investment to per capita GDP (i/y). In a fourth category the papers discuss\nthe ratio of government consumption to GDP and public investment to GDP (gc/y, and\ngi/y). Lastly Barro includes in his regressions a proxy for market distortions and a\nvariable for political instability measured by a nation's propensity for revolution. These\ncategories, sometimes referred to as the Barro regressions, are often used to create the\nbaseline specification in models attempting to test additional dynamic characteristics and\ntheir effects on growth.\nIn Barro (1991), the results from the above specifications on a cross-sample of 98\ncountries, including those rich and poor, reveal a positive relationship between initial\nhuman capital and GDP, and a negative relationship between growth and initial levels of\nper capita GDP. The paper also finds that growth is negatively related to the ratio of\ngovernment spending to per capita GDP, but not significantly related to the share of\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 6\npublic investment. Furthermore Barro concludes that growth is positively related to\npolitical stability and inversely related to market distortions.\nBloom et al (2004) investigate how work experience and health, two components\neconomists have identified as human capital, influence changes in output over time.\nTheir model specifies three components in addition to TFP, physical capital, and changes\nin the labor force, n. These include average years of schooling, mean years work\nexperience of participants in the work force, and health (which they proxy by life\nexpectancy). The main finding of their analysis suggests that health has a significant and\npositive effect on aggregate output over time. Additionally their analysis is a good\nexample of an extension to the baseline regression.\nMore relevant to the specifications used in our analysis, Folster and Henrekson\n(2004), test whether a negative relationship exists between government expenditures and\neconomic growth. Their analysis does not find that a robust relationship exists, however,\nthey conclude that this reflects a prediction that a negative relationship should exist\nprimarily in rich countries with large existing public sectors. These conclusions are also\nsupported by Barro (1991), who predicts that negative effects of government programs\non growth are only observed in countries where government programs exceed a certain\nthreshold. With few exceptions, such programs only exist in rich countries.\nAdditionally there is a disparity between rich and poor countries in terms of the\ncomposition of government spending which compounds the observed difference between\nrich and poor countries in regards to the relationship between government and growth.\nIn rich countries, Folster and Henrekson observe that 80% or more of government\nspending consists of expenditure not related to growth, whereas in poor countries,\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 7\nprograms which are typically found to have positive growth effects, including education,\ninfrastructure, and R&D subsidies, often account for more than half of government\nspending.\nIn regards to our study on the relationship between health and growth, Aghion et al\n(2010) look at the relationship between health factors and economic growth in the\ncontext of endogenous growth theory. Using a cross-country panel between 1960 and\n2000, they used initial levels of life expectancy and improvements in life expectancy\nover time as instruments for investments in healthcare. Using these instruments, they\nfind a positive relationship between healthcare and growth. However, when they restrict\ntheir sample to OECD countries, they find a reduction in this effect, which they attribute\nto healthcare only having significant effects on growth when it impacts mortality rates of\nthose below forty years old.\nTo address problems of endogeneity and fixed effects, which are often inherent in\ngrowth models and in using panel data, we could extend our model further and test the\nresults from OLS using an Arrelano-Bond estimator. Mileva (2007) delivers a tutorial\non the use of an Arellano- Bond GMM differences estimation with an example from a\ncross-country panel used to determine the impact of capital flow from foreign resources\non investment. The benefits of this type of estimator include using first differences to\ncope with fixed effects from unobserved geographic and demographic differences across\nthe panel of countries. Similarly, the lagged levels of the known endogenous variables\nin their model are added, which effectively pre-determines the endogenous variables and\nallows them to be uncorrelated with the error term.\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 8\nII. Data\n\nThe data used in this analysis was collected from a variety of sources including the\nWorld Bank, which provides data for World Development Indicators (WDI), the U.N.,\nthe Penn World Tables 6.1, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The data from\nthe WDI was used to create many of the explanatory variables including the human\ncapital indicators, i.e. the proxies for health and education, which were used in both our\nbaseline regressions and extensions to them. In the regressions where the effect of\nhealthcare regulation was incorporated, the proxies used to measure health care\nregulation were developed using data from both the WDI and WHO. An explanation of\nvariables used in the regressions is included in Appendix 1. Overall, the WDI provided\ndata to develop proxies for human capital, including education rates at the secondary\nlevel, fertility and infant mortality rates, levels of private investment, along with\ngovernment investment in education as a percentage of GDP. Meanwhile, the WHO\nprovided the bulk of data used to build proxies for levels of healthcare regulation,\nincluding public spending on healthcare as a percentage of GDP.\nThe dependent variable we predominantly used was change in GDP per worker.\nThis was used as opposed to GDP per capita since most formal growth models are\nrelated to production functions and are thus more accurately described by output per\nworker than output per capita (Durlauf et al, 2005). Our calculations were based on\nmeasures of real GDP per worker, RGDP, GDP growth from the previous year,\nGDPGrow, along with a variable representing mean GDP growth over each decade in\nthe sample (1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000), GDPG. This variable was used to more\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 9\nclosely replicate the model specified in the Barro regressions, but was not used in the\nsecond set of regressions because of a lack of data prior to 1990.\nEach of the above variables was taken from the Penn World Tables version 6.1\n(Heston et al, 2002), where measures are adjusted for international differences in price\nlevels and take 1996 as a constant base year. The 6.1 tables include data from 168\ncountries between the years 1950 and 2000. Data for this analysis was initially taken\nfrom the years between 1970 and 2000. Earlier years and more recent years were\neliminated due to a lack of data pertaining to education participation rates, public health\nfactors, and government expenditure broken down by country and industry. In the\nextensions to the baseline model, where proxies for healthcare regulation were included,\ndata for a large cross-sample of countries was only available for the six years between\n1995 and 2000.\nThe final cross country sample included 60 countries, 27 half of which were from the\nOECD countries. The entire sample of countries was selected from the 98 used in Barro\n(1991), with countries from that dataset omitted mainly because their economies were\neither extremely poor/instable, or simply due to lack of data. The poorest countries were\nomitted because we felt that the observed effects of public spending on healthcare would\nbe most pronounced and comparable between countries in economies that are both fairly\ndeveloped and with stable political atmospheres. Thus measures of political instability\ndo not appear in our regressions. China was excluded from the dataset due to difficulties\ncapturing accurate levels of output and factor inputs (Durlauf et al, 2002). The recently\ndeveloping countries were included to test earlier theories regarding differences in initial\nlevels of capital and economic development, and their effect on the observed relationship\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 10\nbetween healthcare spending and output. As an additional specification in the OLS\nregressions, we included a dummy NON to indicate non-OECD countries. This variable\nwas used to determine whether there exists a significant difference between countries of\ndifferent levels of initial output on effects of government output, as predicted by Barro\n(1991) and Folster and Henrekson (2004).\n\nFor extensions to the baseline model, we constructed proxies to represent the\ngovernment's involvement, or regulation of healthcare. The variables representing\npublic spending on healthcare as a percentage of GDP, a percentage of total government\nspending, and as a percentage of total healthcare expenditures were constructed mainly\nfrom WHO data in the years between 1995 and 2000. The variables Hi, Hg, and Hh, are\ndescribed in Appendix 1 and summarized in Table 1 below. Additionally, we included\nthe variable HTOT to represent the aggregate spending on healthcare per capita, and to\ninspect how aggregate levels of investment in healthcare interact with public spending\nand how both affect growth. Two graphs comparing levels of healthcare spending to\nGDP growth are included in the last pages of the appendix.\nAn immediate flaw with using aggregate spending by government in an industry\nas a type of proxy is that the variable contains inherent issues of endogeneity for\ncountries with larger economies. These countries, according Kotlikoff and Hagist (2005),\nhave had government healthcare expenditures growing much more rapidly than GDP,\nand much faster relative to less industrialized nations. Thus without controlling for\nOECD, we might observe that as GDP growth declines, which we expect to see as\nindustrialized countries grow richer, that healthcare spending increases. The use of both\nArrelano-Bond as a GMM estimator in place of 2SLS, and a dummy to control for initial\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 11\nlevels of capital within the country, serve as good tools to account for questions of\ncausality in the model. Due to limitations in data on healthcare spending for a large\nnumber of years, and within the scope of this analysis, we did not test alternatives to\nOLS.\n\nInstead of using aggregate levels of healthcare spending, another approach we\ntook was in creating a dummy to proxy for large shifts in healthcare regulation.\nHowever, one of the potential problems with the dummy approach to specifying\ngovernment regulation of healthcare is that there is a lot of subjectivity inherent in such a\nvariable. For instance, there is not a definitive benchmark for determining whether or\nnot a country has undergone a significant change in healthcare policy. Similarly,\ncountries including the United States are continuously making changes to healthcare\nlegislation, which may or may not significantly influence output in the economy.\nAdditionally, from the period of time between when new policies are enacted, to the time\nwhen their effects are realized is not only unclear, but inconsistent across countries.\nWhile looking at dummies and observations of changes in policy over increments of 5 or\neven 10 years may smooth or aggregate minor fluctuations observed in healthcare policy\nbetween individual years, the limitations in data reaching farther back than 1995\nprevented us from creating an adequate variable in this exercise.\n\nIV. Methods\n\nUsing data from the World Bank, the Penn World Tables, the WHO and previous\nregressions from Barro et al (1989, 1991, 1994), we rebuilt a baseline growth model\nsimilar to that which has been widely used in modern growth econometrics. The model\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 12\nwe based our initial set of regressions on, and which stems from both Barro and Solow\nmodels of growth, generally takes the form\nGDPGi,t = αt + γlogRGDPi,t0 + k\nj=1\nβj Xj,i,t +i,t\n\n(1)\n\nGDPGi,t gives average growth rate over time t in country i, and γ is the coefficient on the\noutput component, logRGDPi,t0, which is implied by the Solow growth model. Here\nRGDPi,t0 represents real GDP per worker in base year t0. The variable Xi includes the\nconstant log(ni + g + ), along with the additional extensions specified by Barro (1991) in\nhis growth regressions. The variables which we incorporated from those specified in the\nBarro regressions included proxies for human capital, i.e. variables representing\neducational participation and public health, and a variable for the investment ratio. We\nalso included a variable for government investment in education, to represent public\nspending in areas that are highly correlated with growth.\nAfter including the above indicators our baseline model took the less form\nGDPGi,t= αt +γlnRGDPi,0 + β1Xi,t + β2Ii + β3Gi\nt + β4FERTi + β5EDUi + β6Gi\ne + β7NON+ i,t (2)\n\nIn this expanded specification of the baseline regression, the variable Xi,t\n, labeled GPOP\nbelow, represents the growth in the labor force, created by multiplying the population\ngrowth rate n by the labor participation rate. This variable is an important determinant of\neconomic growth specified by the Solow model. The variables Ii, Gi. FERTi , EDUi, and\nGi\ni represent investment as a percentage of output, government expenditure as a\npercentage of output, fertility rates, rates of enrollment in secondary education, and\ngovernment investment education as a percentage of GDP. Table 2.1 gives the results\nfrom the above regression. The first and second columns look at growth between year t\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 13\nand t-1, regressed on lnGDP per worker measured in each of 4 base years (1970, 1980,\n1990, and 2000). Column 3 was included, because as opposed to changes in GDP per\nyear, the Barro regressions used as a dependent variable the mean growth of output over a\nlonger time period t (1970-1985 and 1960-1985). To better compare the results from our\nbaseline model to Barro's we created a similar variable GDPG using the same\nspecification as in column 2, where GDPG measured mean growth between the years\n1970-1980, 1980-1990, and 1990-2000. Table 2.2 gives Barro's (1991) which we used as\na comparison to gauge whether results from the baseline set of regressions made sense.\n\nAfter compiling and looking at results from the baseline regressions, we altered\nthe model to incorporate the specifications of interest, which we hoped would determine\nthe relationship between levels of healthcare regulation and economic growth. The\nregression used in this part of our analysis follows from above and includes our proxies\nfor healthcare regulation.\nGDPGi,t = αt + γlogRGDPi,0 + β2Ii + β3Gi + β4Gi\ni\n+ β5NON + k\nj=1\nj Hj\n,i,t + i,t\n(4)\nFrom 4, we included additional specifications to the Barro model, adding a set of\nvariables Hj\n,i,t representing the various proxies for healthcare regulation in the time and\ncountry being observed. Table 3 of the appendix gives the results from our regressions\nusing different proxies for healthcare regulation.\n\nV. Results\n\nThe results from the series of baseline regressions performed in this model are\nlisted in Table 2.1 of the Appendix, with a quick reference to the results from Barro\n(1991) in Table 2.2. From the cross-sample of 60 countries, and a model similar to that\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 14\nwhich was specified by Barro, the results from 2.1 were encouraging in that they were\nmainly in line with economic theory.\n\nFrom the first column in Table 2.1, initial levels of GDP per worker have a\nsignificant and negative correlation with growth. In addition to the negative correlation\nbetween initial levels of output, we found a significant and negative correlation between\ngovernment consumption and growth. From 2.2 these results are supported by Barro\n(1991), which predicted that the observed effect of government spending would be\nsignificant and negative, and that this effect would be more pronounced in wealthier\ncountries.\n\nAlso in line with the findings of Folster and Henrekson, we found no significant\nrelationship between government spending in areas typically correlated with growth,\nwhich in this case was modeled by government expenditure on education. Similarly we\nfound no significance in the relationship between rates of infant mortality, represented by\nthe coefficient on MORT and fertility rates, FERT and growth. One explanation for this\ncould be that the countries in this sample are not diverse enough from the perspective of\ninitial levels of GDP (that is we did not include the poorest of countries), to notice a\nsignificant effect of these two indicators. In another sample, where greater disparities\nexisted between rates of poverty, we might have seen a significant relationship between\ngovernment spending on human capital and growth. Another explanation for the lack of\nrelationship is that there might be a lagged effect between government spending and\ngrowth which we haven't accounted for.\n\nTwo other relationships which were in line with the findings from Barro were the\nrelationships between total government spending as a percentage of GDP, G, and rates of\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 15\nsecondary education, listed as EDU in Table 2.1. From our results, the coefficient on\neducation is significant and positive, indicating that higher rates of participation in\neducation have a positive impact on output. Additionally, our results showed a negative\nrelationship between total government spending and economic output, which was\npredicted by Barro, who attested that high levels of government spending in richer\ncountries would have a negative effect on those economies. Satisfied with the\nconsistency of our results with both economic intuition and findings from earlier models,\nthe model was extended to incorporate government involvement in healthcare.\n\nThe results from the expanded model are provided in Table 3 of the appendix.\nThis model includes the indicators of healthcare regulation and attempts to find whether\nthere exists a relationship between government involvement in healthcare, or total\nspending on healthcare and growth. From the Table 3 the coefficient on Hi, which\nrepresents government expenditure on healthcare as a percentage of total GDP, is both\nnegative and significant in each of the regressions. This implies that a higher level of\ngovernment involvement in healthcare, relative to GDP, is negatively associated with\neconomic growth. Additionally, from each of the columns in Table 3, the coefficients on\nboth lnRGDP and G are no longer significant. This effect may imply that levels of initial\nGDP and government spending, which appeared to negatively effect growth in the earlier\nregressions can largely be explained when government spending on healthcare relative to\nGDP is controlled for.\nWhen HTOT was included in column 3, the significance and sign on Hi did not\nchange, implying that the negative relationship between Hi and growth exists even when\naggregate levels of healthcare spending are controlled for More specifically the\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 16\ninvolvement of government in healthcare appears to have more of an effect on growth\nthan the economy as a whole investing in healthcare.\nBased on implications regarding the differences between OECD and non-OECD\ncountries in terms of how healthcare spending might affect growth, and so the\ninterpretation of the variable NON is important for understanding the interactions\nbetween public spending and growth under different circumstances. From Table 3, the\ncoefficient on NON is not significant, implying that differences in levels of initial GDP\ndo not have a significant effect on the relationship between healthcare involvement and\neconomic growth.\nTo further understand the differences between OECD and non-OECD countries,\nand the relationship between government spending in healthcare and economic growth,\nGraphs 1 and 2 are included at the back of the appendix. From both graphs a negative\nrelationship between public spending on healthcare and economic growth can be\nobserved. Also in both graphs, as spending on healthcare begins to exceed 4% of GDP,\nthe relationship becomes increasingly negative. This, as follows from Barro, is because\ngovernment spending beyond a certain threshold likely has diminishing (and apparently\nnegative) returns to productivity. Up to that threshold, especially in the non-OECD\ncountries, this government investment in healthcare is necessary for improving health\nfactors in those countries, which are found to have a significant impact on growth in\nhuman capital, and ultimately economic growth.\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 17\nVI. Conclusion\n\nWith healthcare costs rising rapidly, and disparities in healthcare increasing\nacross the globe, understanding the implications of spending on healthcare is important\nas more countries look toward reforming their healthcare systems. As we considered the\nsituation closer to home, with an aging population and major changes being enacted in\ngovernment policy, it is important for policymakers to try and understand the\nimplications of their involvement in a sector that makes up such a large portion of\neconomic activity. However, beyond the scope of economic analysis, and optimization,\nthere are other reasons for government to invest in different sectors. Healthcare is an\nextremely charged topic, and an issue that has been growing in severity and in need of\nreform for a long time. In this sense, maximizing economic growth is not always the\npriority, and the implications of empirical analyses only lead to better understandings of\nrelationships, but do not necessarily imply ideal policy.\nThat being said, from our analysis, which was largely based on extending models\nfrom earlier and widely used growth analyses, we determined that a negative relationship\nexists between high levels of public spending on healthcare as a percentage of GDP and\nchanges in economic output. Additionally, we observed that above a certain threshold of\npublic investment in healthcare, this effect is even stronger. These findings may imply\nthat while initial levels of government spending on healthcare, for instance to eradicate\ndisease by subsidizing vaccinations, may have a positive effect on output, large amounts\nof spending in areas such as health insurance and providing prescription drugs may be\ninefficient in terms of promoting economic growth.\n\nEffects of Healthcare Regulation 18\n\nIn terms of other areas of interest, vast changes in healthcare policy in many of\nthe developed countries, including the United States, which have only begun to take\naffect, will make for interesting future research into the implications of widespread\nchanges in government spending. Similarly, it would be interesting to test outside the\nrealm of output, how large changes in government spending impact factors pertaining to\nhuman capital, including education, life expectancy, and other indicators of health.\n\nApart from the implications of our findings and additional areas of interest, there\nare inherent flaws in this growth model, which should be addressed. Moreover there\nexist more complicated models which might provide better insight into relationships we\nhoped to observe. Some of the flaws in any growth model include inherent issues with\nendogeneity, where it is unclear whether the changes in output influence a factor such as\nspending, or vice versa. Similarly there are issues of time lag, where the effect of\nspending now may not have an observable affect on output for some period of time. One\nsuggested approach to dealing with both of these issues is the use of an Arellano-Bond\nGMM estimator, which has been touched on throughout the analysis. The Arellano-\nBond effectively observes the relationship between a variable at a certain time and that\nsame variable at an earlier time, simultaneously accounting for lagged effects while pre-\ndetermining and accounting for variables which are definitely endogenous. While this\ntechnique would have dealt with many issues inherent to our model, the sample, which\nincluded fewer than 10 years' worth of data on healthcare, would have made for few\ninteresting observations.

(40% of the grade)\nConsider an economy that lasts for only two periods, t ∈{0, 1}. The economy is populated by a rep-\nresentative, price-taking household and a benevolent government. Income (GDP) and government\nspending are exogenously given and constant over time: yt = y and gt = g , for t ∈{0, 1}.\nThe household preferences are given by\nU = c0 + βc1,\nwhere β ∈(0, 1) is the discount factor and ct is the period-t consumption. The household's budget\nconstraints are given by the following:\nc0 + a = y -T0\nc1 = (1 + R) a + y -T1,\nwhere a are the savings of the household during the first period, R is the interest rate, and Tt are\nthe lump-sum taxes levied by the government at time t. The household is choosing c0 and c1 so as\nto maximize its life-time utility U subject to its own budget constraints (taking income, taxes, and\nthe interest rate as exogenous)\nThe government starts with no initial debt. Its budget constraints are therefore as follows:\ng = T0 + b\ng + (1 + R) b = T1,\nwhere b is the level of debt issued in the first period (and paid offin the second period). The\ngovernment is free to choose any triplet (T0, T1, b) subject to the above constraints. Finally, the\ninterest rate R adjusts in equilibrium so that a = b (i.e., household saving equals government\nborrowing).\n(i) Starting from a status quo of balanced budget (T0 = g , T1 = g , b = 0), the government con-\ntemplates the following policy change: running a deficit in the first period (T0 < g ), accumulating\ndebt (b > 0), and paying offthis debt with a surplus in the second period (T1 > g ). How is this\npolicy change going to affect the household's consumption and saving? How is it going to affect the\nequilibrium interest rate? (Provide both an intuitive answer and a formal proof.)\n(ii) Suppose the government chooses T0, T1 and b so as to maximize welfare U. Is there a unique\ntriplet (T0, T1, b) that attains the maximum?\n(iii) Consider now the following modification: consumers dislike paying taxes, in the sense that\ntheir preferences are now represented by\nU = [c0 -Λ(T0)] + β [c1 -Λ(T1)]\nwhere Λ is a strictly increasing and convex function. How does this affect your answer to part (ii)?\nIs it optimal to balance the budget?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.05 Intermediate Macroeconomics\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "14.05 Lecture Notes\nConsumption and Saving\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nMIT Department of Economics\nMarch 4, 2013\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nTwo-Period Consumption/Saving Problem\nConsider a household that lives two periods (t ∈{0, 1}), faces no uncertainty about its tastes,\nincome, and interest rates, and chooses consumption/savings over these two periods:\nmax U(c0, c1)\ns.t.\nc0 + a1 ≤(1 + R)a0 + w0\nc1 + a2 ≤(1 + R)a1 + w1\na0 = a 0,\na2 ≥0\nwith a 0 > 0 exogenously given.\nHere, ct ≥0 denotes consumption in period t, at ≤≥0 denotes the stock of assets in the\nbeginning of period t (equivalently the savings accumulated by the end of period t-1), Rt = R ≥0\nis the return on these assets (the interest rate between t -1 and t), and wt ≥0 is the wage in\nperiod t (also the labor income of the household, since we are fixing labor supply to 1 unit). Finally,\nU : R2\n+ →R represents the life-time utility function, and is a strictly increasing, strictly concave,\nand twice differentiable.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\nBecause U is strictly increasing in at least one of its arguments, it is clearly optimal to satisfy\nthe budget constraints with equality and to set a2 = 0: it would have been suboptimal to leave\n\"food on the table\". Thus let us set a2 = 0 in the above problem and restate the budget constraints\nwith equality instead of weak inequality.\nNext, pick an arbitrary scalar q0 > 0 and multiply both budget constraints by this number;\nclearly, this does not affect the budget set. Finally, solve the period-1 budget constraint for a1 and\nsubstitute the solution into the period-0 budget constraint.\nWe can then restate the household's problem as\nmax U(c0, c1)\ns.t.\nq0c0 + q1c1 = q0x0\nwhere\nq1\nx0 ≡(1 + R)a0 + w0 +\nw1\nq0\nq1 ≡\nq0\n1 + R\n(with arbitrary q0 > 0).\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nNow focus on the following problem:\nmax U(c0, c1)\ns.t.\nq0c0 + q1c1 = q0x0\nIf I had not told you where this problem came from, all you would see here is a static, micro-style,\nconsumer problem with two goods, whose quantities are denoted by c0 and c1 and whose prices are\ndenoted by q0 and q1. The fact that these two goods represent consumption \"now\" and \"tomorrow\",\nrather than \"apples\" and \"bananas\", makes no formal difference.\nAccordingly, note the relative price of two goods reflects the interest rate between the two\nperiods:\nq1\n=\nq0\n1 + R\nAn increase in the interest rate therefore translates to a fall in the price of future consumption\nrelative to the price of current consumption.\nFurthermore, the \"effective wealth\" of the household, captured above in x0, includes not only\nthe initial amount of assets, but also the labor income received in both periods of life.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\nFinally, it is as if the household faces a single budget constraint, which is given above by\nq0c0 + q1c1 = q0x0. This constraint, which summarizes the constraints put on the dynamic path\nof consumption from the combination of the two per-period constraints, is customarily called the\n\"intertemporal budget constraint\".\nNotwithstanding these interpretational issues, we have formalized--and can now proceed to\nsolve--the intertemporal consumption/saving problem of the household as if it were a conventional,\nstatic, multi-good consumption problem in microeconomics.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nThus let λ be the Lagrange multiplier on the inter temporal budget constraint and set up the\nLagrangian of the aforementioned problem:\nL ≡U(c0, c1) + λ[q0x0 -q0c0 -q1c1]\nTaking the FOCs, and assuming an interior solution, we get that the optimal consumption bundle\nmust solve the following system:\nUc0(c0, c1) = λq0\nUc1(c0, c1) = λq1\nalong with the intertemporal budget constraint\nq0c0 + q1c1 = Ω\nEquivalently, the optimal consumption bundle must solve\nUc1(c0, c1)\nq1\n=\nUc0(c0, c1)\nq0\n\n≡1 + R\nalong with intertemporal budget constraint.\n\nThis can be represented graphically in the usual way: the optimum is where the indifference\ncurve is tangent to the budget line.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\nWithout loss of generality, we can normalize q0 = 1 (remember that only relative prices matter,\nnot nominal/absolute ones).\nNow fix x0 and consider an increase in R (equivalently, a reduction in q1/q0, the relative price\nof future consumption). What happens to the budget line? What do you expect to happen to c0\nand c1? What are the income and substitution effects at work?\nAlternatively, let us set a0 = 0, so that x0 = w0 + q1w1, and fix w0 and w1, but let x0 vary with\nq0\nq1/q0. What happens to the budget line? What do you expect to happen to c0 and c1? What are\nthe income and substitution effects at work?\nShow the above graphically...\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nSpecial case: separable preferences\nNow, let as specify the following presences:\nU(c0, c1) = u(c0) + βu(c1)\nwhere β ≡\n∈(0, 1) is the \"subjective discount factor\" (ρ > 0 is the \"subjective discount rate\")\n1+ρ\nand u is a strictly increasing, strictly concave, and twice differentiable. Then we can restate the\nkey optimality conditions as\nu′(c0) = β(1 + R)u′(c1)\nTo interpret this condition, consider an incremental reduction in c0 by a small ε > 0 (equivalently,\nan incremental increase in savings). This reduces current utility by u′(c0)ε but raises future con-\nsumption by (1 + R)ε, which in turn raises future utility by u′(c1)ε. Since the latter is discounted\nin today's terms by β, we conclude that β(1 + R)u′(c1) represents the marginal benefit of savings\nwhile u′(c0) represents the marginal cost. At the optimum, the two must be equated, which gives\nthe intuition behind the above condition.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\nSpecial case: R = ρ\nSuppose that the interest rate happens to coincide with the subjective discount factor:\nR = ρ\n(equiv., β(1 + R) = 1)\nThen, the aforementioned optimality condition reduces to u′(c0) = u′(c1), which in turn gives\nc0 = c1\nThat is, the household \"smoothes\" consumption across periods.\nThe key idea behind this form of consumption smoothing is the following.\nBecause of the\ncurvature of the per-period utility function, the household tends to like a flat consumption plan over\nhis lifecycle. In particular, if the return to savings is just enough to compensate for intertemporal\ndiscounting (R = ρ), the household will find it optimal to choose a perfectly flat consumption path.\nHowever, if the return to saving is higher, then the household will find it worthwhile to sacrifice\nsome consumption today for the benefit of higher consumption in the future: when the price of\ncurrent consumption is high relative to future consumption, it is optimal to substitute less con-\nsumption today for more consumption today. As a result, when R > ρ, the household will choose\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nan upward sloping consumption path (c1 > c0). Conversely, when R < ρ, consumption today is\nsufficiently cheap relative to consumption tomorrow that the household opts for a downward sloping\npath (c1 < c0)\nThat been said, let us continue with the special case in which R = ρ and, to further simplify,\nlet a = 0. We then have that q1 =\n= β and that the intertemporal budget becomes\nq0\n1+ρ\nc0 + βc1 = x0 = w0 + βw1\n[Check: How does the above change when a0 > 0?] Using then the optimality condition that c0 = c1,\nwe conclude that\nc0 = c1 =\n1 w +\nβ\nw1\n1+β\n1+β\nwhich means that the household consumes a certain weighted average of its labor income across its\nlifetime. This weighted average represents the \"annuity value\" of lifetime labor income.\nNow, note that we have solved for the optimal consumption plan of the household but have\nnot yet specified the saving (or borrowing) that the household is doing between periods 0 and 1 in\norder to support this optimal plan. To do this, we must simply go back to the per-period budget\nconstraint and figure out the value of a1 that supports the optimal consumption plan.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\nUsing the period-0 budget (and the fact that a0 = 0 by assumption), we get that a1 is simply\ngiven by\na1 = w0 -c1\nWe thus conclude that the following is true:\n- if w0 > w1, then c0 < w0, c1 > w1, and a1 > 0.\n- if w0 = w1, then c0 = w0, c1 = w1, and a1 = 0.\n- if w0 < w1, then c0 > w0, c1 < w1, and a1 < 0.\nThat is, if the household has lower income when \"young\" than when \"old\", then it borrows in order\nto sustain higher consumption early on for the expense of lower consumption later on. Conversely,\nif income is higher now than in the future, the household saves in order to bring its consumption in\nthe future at par with its consumption in the present. In either case, the household is smoothing\nconsumption, and saving/borrowing is merely the instrument that facilitates this smoothing.\n[Homework: how does the above change if a0 > 0?]\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nSmoothing vs intertemporal substitution vs wealth effects\nMoving away from the case where R = ρ, the \"consumption smoothing\" forces we have described\nremain present, but now work in tandem with the earlier mentioned intermporal substitution and\nincome effects.\nIn particular, if R > ρ, then the household has an incentive to postpone consumption because\nfuture consumption has become \"cheaper\". The substitution effect thus tends to tilt the optimal\nconsumption plan toward the future: it tends to reduce c0 and raise c1 relative to the aforementioned\nperfect-smoothing benchmark.\nAt the same time, depending on whether the household was saving or borrowing, there is a\npositive or negative wealth effect. If the household was saving (a1 > 0, or c1 > w1), then the\namount of present consumption that the household must sacrifice in order to sustain a given level of\nfuture consumption decreases with an increase in the interest rate, which means that the household\nis, in effect, richer.\nThis positive wealth effect tends to raise both c0 and c1.\nIf, instead, the\nhousehold was borrowing, then an increase in R means that the household is, in effect, poorer,\nwhich tends to reduce both c0 and c1.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\nMulti-Period Consumption/Saving Problem\n- Consider a household named \"j\" that lives during periods t ∈{0, 1, ...τ} for some finite τ ≥1.\nIts consumption/saving problem can be expressed as follows:\nτ\nmax\nX\nβtU(cj\nt)\n(1)\nt=0\ns.t.\ncj\nj\nj\nj\nt + at+1 = (1 + Rt)at + wtlt -Tt\n∀t ∈{0, 1, ..., τ}\n(2)\na0 > 0 given\n(3)\naτ+1 ≥0\n(4)\nwhere U is a strictly increasing and strictly concave utility function, cj\nt denotes consumption\nin period t, aj\nt+1 denotes saving in period t (equivalently, the assets in the beginning of period\nt + 1), lj\nt denotes supply of labor (which is here exogenously fixed), wt denotes the real wage,\nRt denotes the real interest rate between periods t -1 and t, and Tt is a lump-sum tax.\n- Condition (2) is the period-t budget constraint; (3) is the exogenously given initial amount of\nassets; and (4) is a constrain that rules out dying in debt.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nThe Intertemporal Budget\n- Pick an arbitrary q0 > 0 (say q0 = 1) and define qt recursively by\nqt\nq0\nqt =\n-\n= ... =\n.\n1 + Rt\n(1 + R1)(1 + R2)...(1 + Rt)\nNote that qt/qs represents the price of period-t consumption relative to period-s consump-\ntion. Without any loss of generality, we can always normalize q0 = 1 so that qt = qt/q0 is the\nprice of period-t consumption relative to period-0 consumption.\n- Multiplying the period-t budget by qt, adding up over all t, and using the fact that the\nhousehold will optimally set aτ+1 = 0, we get\nX\nτ\nqt\nt\n=0\n· cj = q0 · xj\n(5)\nt\nwhere\nxj\n0 ≡(1 + R0)aj\nj\n0 + h0,\nτ\nhj\nq\n0 ≡\nt [wtlj\nq\nt\nt=0\n-Tt].\nX\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\n- Condition (5) is called the \"intertemporal budget constraint.\" It is a constraint on the entire\npath (sequence) of the consumption of the household over its lifespan.\n- To interpret this constraint, note that (1 + R0)aj\n0 is the household's financial wealth in the\nbeggining of its life (at t = 0), while hj\n0 is the present value of the labor income it receives\nover its life minus any tax obligations; we often call hj\n0 the household's human wealth as of\nperiod 0. The sum xj\n0 ≡(1+R0)aj\n0 +hj\n0 therefore represents the household's total, or effective,\nwealth. This constraint therefore reads: the present value of the consumption expenditure of\nthe household cannot exceed its effective wealth.\n- Note that the set of per-period budgets (a total of τ + 1 constraints) is a set of constraints on\ntwo kinds of endogenous variables: the consumption path {ct}τ\nt=0 and the saving/borrowing\npath {at+1}τ\nt=0. On the other hand, the intertemporal budget constraint (which is a single\nconstraint) is a constraint merely on the consumption path {ct}τ\nt=0. In effect, when we go\nfrom the set of per-period budgets to the single intertemporal budget, we are reducing out\nthe saving/borrowing path. This underscores that saving/borrowing is merely an instrument\nthrough which the household seeks to attain a particular path in its consumption.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- By the same token, suppose we are given a consumption path {ct}τ\nt=0 that satisfies the in-\ntertemporal budget. Then, we can always find a path of saving/borrowing {at+1}τ\nt=0 such that\nthe per-period budgets are also satisfied for all t.\n- Indeed, by direct analogy to (5), we have that, for any period s ∈{0, 1, ...τ},\nX\nτ\nq\nj\nj\nj\nt · ct = qs · xs ≡qs\n\n(1 + Rs)as + hs\nt=s\n\n(6)\nwhere hj\nτ\nqt\nj\ns ≡\nt=s\n[wtlt -Tt]. In words, the present value of consumption from period s on\nqs\nshould equal\nP\nthe sum of the financial wealth of the household in that period and the present\nvalue of its labor income from that period on. It follows that\nτ\n(1 + Rs)as = hj\ns -\nX qt cj\nq\nt\ns\nt=s\nor equivalently (using the definition of hj\ns),\nτ\nqt\n(1 + Rs)as =\n[wtlj\nt -Tt -ct].\n(7)\nqs\nX\nt=s\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\nwhich simply says that the financial wealth of the household in period s (equivalently, its\nsavings/borrowing in period s -1) should be just enough to offset any difference between the\npresent value of its net-of-taxes labor income and its consumption from that period on.\n- Therefore, we can always solve for the optimal consumption and saving/borrowing in two\nsteps. First, we solve the following quasi-static optimization problem:\nτ\nmax\nX\nβtU(cj\nt)\n(8)\nt=0\nτ\ns.t.\nX\nqtcj\nt = q0xj\n(9)\nt=0\nThe solution to this problem gives us the optimal consumption path. Next, once we have\nthe optimal consumption plan, we use (7), or equivalently the set of per-period budgets, to\nrecover the path of at+1 that supports this consumption plan.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Important qualification: credit frictions. The fact that we can replace the set of per-period\nbudgets in (2) with the single intertemporal budget in (9) hinges on the assumption of fric-\ntionless credit markets. In particular, suppose that we solve the aforementioned quasi-static\noptimization problem, which only imposes the intertemporal budget, proceed to recover the\npath of at+1 that supports the optimal consumption path, and find that, for some t, at+1 < 0.\nThis means that the household must borrow in period t in order to attain its optimal consump-\ntion path. But say that credit markets are imperfect and households are unable to borrow.\nThen, clearly, the aforementioned path will no more be feasible. The consumption path that\nis optimal in the presence of borrowing constraints and other credit frictions could thus be\nvery different from the one that is optimal in the absence of such frictions, which is all that\nwe have been studying so far. We will revisit this issue in due course. For the time being, let\nus put this qualification and continue analyzing the problem in the absence of credit frictions.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\n- To characterize the optimal consumption plan, we can set up the Lagrangian for the quasi-\nstatic optimization problem in (8)-(9).\nLetting λ > 0 be the Lagrange multiplier on the\n(single) intertemporal budget constraint, we have that the Lagragian of the problem is\nτ\nL =\nX\nτ\nβtU(ct) + λ\nq\nt\n(\n0x0\n=0\n-\nX\nqtct\nt=0\n)\n(10)\n(Note that I have dropped the j superscript in order to simplify notation.)\nFor any t ∈\n{0, 1, ...., τ}, the FOC with respect to ct gives\nβtU ′(ct) = λqt,\n∀t ∈{0, 1, ...., τ},\n(11)\nFurthermore, since the objective is strictly concave in the choice vector {c\nτ\nt}t=0 and the con-\nstraint is linear in this vector, the combination of these FOCs conditions along with the in-\ntertemporal budget constraint are both necessary and sufficient for optimality, and pin down\na unique optimal path.\n- Note that the aforementioned FOCs gives us τ + 1 equations (as many as the periods). Com-\nbining with the intertemporal budget, we get τ +2 equations. At the same time, we have τ +2\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nunknowns: the τ + 1 consumption levels (one for each period) and the Lagrange multiplier\nλ. Therefore, we have as many equations as unknowns. The existence and uniqueness of a\nsolution to this system follows from the existence and uniqueness of the optimum, which in\nturn is guaranteed by the continuity and strict concavity of U\n- It is useful to rewrite the FOCs in a way that reduces out the Lagrange multiplier.\nIn\nparticular, if we take the FOC for period t + 1 and divide it, side by side, with the FOC for\nperiod t, we get the following set of equivalent optimality conditions:\nU ′(ct)\nqt\n=\n1 + Rt+1\nt\nβU ′(ct+1)\nqt+1\n≡\n∀∈{0, 1, ...., τ -1},\n(12)\nThis condition, which is known as the \"intertemporal Euler condition\", has a straightforward\ninterpretation: the MRS between consumption in t and consumption in t + 1 must equal the\ncorresponding price ratio, which itself equal one plus the interest rate between t and t + 1.\n-\n′\nNote then that an increase in Rt+1 is necessarily associated with an increase in\nU (ct) . Since\nβU′(ct+1)\nU is strictly concave, and therefore U ′ is strictly decreasing, this means that an increase in\nthe interest rate induces the household to tilt its consumption from period t to period t + 1:\nwhen the relative price of a good increases, the consumer substitutes away from that good.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\nThe Consumption Problem with CEIS Preferences\n- To get a sharper characterization of the optimal consumption plan, we now impose that the\nutility function takes the following isoelastic, or power, form:\nc1-1/θ\nU(c) = 1 -1/θ\nwhere θ > 0 is an exogenous scalar.\n- You can check that θ coincides with the elasticity of substitution between the two goods ct and\nct+1 evaluated at the point ct = ct+1 = c , for arbitrary c . In this sense, θ parameterizes the\nwillingness of the household to substitute consumption from one period to another. We thus\ncustomarily refer to θ as the \"Elasticity of Intertemporal Substitution\" (EIS). And because\nthis elasticity is constant (invariant to the level of consumption), we refer to the aforemen-\ntioned preference specification as \"CEIS preferences\" (for Constant Elasticity of Intertemporal\nSubstitution). This is formally analogous to the standard CES preferences you must have seen\nin micro.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- With this specification for U, we have that U ′(c) = c-1/θ and therefore the intertemporal\nEuler condition (12) becomes\nc-1/θ\nt\nqt\n=\n(1 + R\n)\n(13)\n-\nt+1\n1/θ\nβc\nqt+1\nt+1\n≡\nor equivalently\nct+1 = [β(1 + Rt+1)]θ\n(14)\nct\nThe growth rate of consumption between t and t + 1 is therefore an increasing function of the\ncorresponding interest rate, underscoring the substitution effect we discussed above.\n- In fact, you can take the log of the above condition and use the fact that log(1 + x) ≈x for\nany small number x and that β = 1/(1 + ρ) to rewrite this condition as\nlog ct+1 -log ct ≈θ(Rt+1 -ρ)\nWe thus see that the slope of the (log)consumption path is determined by the difference\nbetween the real interest rate and the subjective discount rate, multiplied by the EIS.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\n- In particular, consumption grows over time if and only if the interest rate exceeds the sub-\njective discount rate; and for any given gap between the interest rate and the discount rate,\nthe associated consumption growth is higher the higher the EIS. These properties underscore\nthe role of discounting and intertemporal substitution. When R = ρ, the return to saving is\njust enough to compensate for the subjective cost of postponing consumption. When R > ρ,\nthe return to saving outweighs the subjective cost of postponing consumption (equivalently,\nthe relative price of consumption today is particularly high) and induces the consumer to\nsubstitute away from current consumption to future consumption. The higher the EIS θ, the\nmore the consumer is willing to substitute for any given relative prices, and the higher the\noptimal consumption growth for any given gap between the interest rate and the discount.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Finally, to get a closed-form solution to the optimal consumption levels, we proceed as follows.\nFirst, using (13) recursively, we have that, for all t,\nqt\n-θ\nc\nt\nt = c0(β )θ\n\nq0\n\n.\nSubstituting this into the intertemporal budget constraint and solving for c0 we conclude that\nc0 = m0 · x0\nwhere\nm0 ≡P\n.\nτ\n=0 (βt)θ\nt\n(qt/q\nθ\n0)1-\nConsumption is thus linear in effective wealth and m0 represents the MPC (marginal propen-\nsity to consume) out of effective wealth as of period 0.\n- Question: how does m0 depend on the sequence of interest rates from 0 up to τ? What about\nx0? Identify and interpret the competing income and substitution effects of interest rates on\nconsumption.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\n- Consider now the special case in which the interest rate equal the discount rate, so that R = ρ\nand β(1 + R) = 1. Then, the Euler condition implies\nct = c0\n∀t,\nwhich together with the budget constraint (and letting a0 = 0 for simplicity) gives\nτ+1 qsws\nct = c0 =\nP\nP\ns=0\nτ+1\nt\ns=0 qs\n∀\nConsumption is therefore flat over time and its level is pinned down by the annuity value of\nlabor income. You can think of this as follows: the consumer sells the entire stream of his labor\nincome to a bank, receives the present value of this stream, deposits it to a savings account\nwith interest rate R, and thereafter consumes the return of this account, plus a constant\namount that is just enough to guarantee that the balance of the account becomes zero exactly\nat the moment the household dies (at t = τ).\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- To simplify further, take the limit as ρ(= R) →0 (zero discounting and zero interest). In this\ncase, qt = q0(= 1) for all t and the optimal consumption reduces to\n+1\nct = c0 =\nX\nτ\nws\nt\nτ + 1 s=0\n∀\nThat is, the household consumes the average of the labor income he receives over this lifetime.\nHow is this achieved through borrowing and saving? In periods where his income is lower\nthan average he runs down his savings or borrows; in periods where his income is higher than\naverage, he accumulates savings or pays back any previous borrowing.\n- When the interest rate is constant over time but different than the discount rate, the same\ngeneral principle applies: the household uses saving and borrowing to transfer resources from\nperiods where his income is relatively high to periods where his income is relatively low in order\nto \"smooth\" his consumption and insulate it from the fluctuations in his income. Formally,\nlog ct is a linear function of t, no matter how much log wt fluctuates over time. The only\ndifference is that the optimal consumption path is not necessarily flat: it can have either a\npositive or a negative slope, depending on whether the interest rate is higher or lower than\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\ndiscounting. As explained earlier, this slope is given by θ(R -ρ). We conclude that log ct is\na linear function of t, with slope equal to θ(R -ρ).\n- Finally, suppose that the interest rate varies over time.\nThen, it is no more optimal to\nperfectly smooth consumption: log ct is no more linear in t. Instead, in periods where the\ninterest rates are relatively higher, it is optimal to tilt the consumption path upwards (i.e.,\nto increase the growth rate of consumption); conversely, in periods where the interest rate\nis lower, it is optimal to tilt downwards (i.e., to reduce the growth rate of consumption).\nTherefore, variation in interest rates justify deviations from consumption smoothing, and can\ncause consumption to fluctuate even in the absence of any fluctuation in income.\n- To recap, the key lessons we get from all the preceding analysis are the following: Other\nthings equal, it is desirable to smooth consumption over time and to insulate consumption\nfrom income fluctuations. To the extent that households can freely borrow and save, con-\nsumption is therefore insulated from income fluctuations. What, instead, drives fluctuations\nin consumption is only fluctuations in interest rates--or, of course, in the ability to borrow\nand save.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nApplications (mentioned in class and for you to think)\n- Consider the lifecycle of the typical individual. When is his income relatively higher? When\nis it relatively lower? When do you expect him to borrow and when to save?\n- Suppose an individual looses his job. Should he run down his savings and borrow? How does\nthe response of his optimal consumption and saving/borrowing depends on the likely length\nof his unemployment spell?\n- Interpret a whole country as a consumer that can borrow and save in international capital\nmarkets. Borrowing more from other countries means running a current account deficit; saving\nmore abroad means running a current account surplus. Suppose now that the interest rate\nat which the country can save or borrow falls. How does this affects the country's optimal\nconsumption in the present and how in the future? How does this depends on whether the\ncountry was a borrower or a saver?\n- Consider either the case of the United States or the case of southern european countries\nsuch as Greece, Spain and Italy. During the 10 years or so before the crisis, these countries\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\nexperienced a fall in the interest rates in which they could borrow from other countries. In\nthe case of Greece, Spain and Italy, the fall in interest rates was probably the byproduct of\nentering the EuroZone; in the case of the US, some argue this was because of the increase in\ndemand for US treasury bills and other US assets from China. Around the same time interval,\nthese countries experience a consumption boom and a worsening of their current account. Are\nthese facts--the reduction in interest rates, the consumption boom, and the current-account\nimbalances--consistent with one another under the lenses of the theory we have developed?\nIf this is the right explanation of what happened, is there a case that the current account\ndeficits of these countries were suboptimal, or excessive, and that their governments should\nhave done something to correct them?\n- Consider an economy that enters a recession. According to the theory we have develop, do\nyou expect domestic consumption to fall as much as domestic income, more, or less? How\ndoes this may depend on whether the country is open (can borrow and save abroad) or closed?\n- If the economy is closed, what is the instrument through which the country can smooth its\nconsumption over time? If the economy is open, what is the additional instrument it can use?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.05 Intermediate Macroeconomics\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

This variant abstracts from\nthe design of optimal deposit contracts and focuses on the coordination problem.\nSetting. There are three periods, t ∈0, 1, 2; a bank that accepts demand deposits and invests\nthem either in a liquid low-return asset or an illiquid high-return asset; and a mass 1 of agents, who\neach deposit 1 unit of wealth at t = 0 and then decides whether to withdraw at t = 1 or t = 2.\nAgents can be of two types: \"impatient\" agents die at t = 1 and hence must consume at t = 1,\nwhile \"patient\" agents die at t = 2 and are indifferent about the timing of their consumption.\nAn agent's type is realized in the begging of t = 1 and is private info to him. Let λ ∈(0, 1) be\nthe fraction of patient agents.\nLet L be the liquid position of the bank, I the illiquid position, and R the rate of return on the\nilliquid assets. Also, suppose that the liquidation value of illiquid assets is δ < 1.\n(The variables λ, L, I, R, δ are all exogenous.)\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Crises and Multiple Equilibria\nPayoffs. Let K denote the mass of agents withdrawing at t = 1, π1(K) the payofffor an\nagent (patient or impatient) who withdraws at t = 1, and π2(K) the payofffor a patient agent who\nwithdraws at t = 2 (the payofffor an impatient agent who withdraws at t = 2 is 0).\nPayoffs depend on K as follows:\nRI + (L\nK)\nK < L\n⇒\nπ1(K) = 1,\nπ2(K) =\n-\n1 -K\n(Any remaining liquidity for t = 1 is invested at zero interest and then at t = 2 it is distributed\ntogether with RI to the agents who waited. )\nRI\n-\nL < K < L + δ\n-Rδ\n1(K -L)\nI\n⇒\nπ1(K) = 1,\nπ2(K) =\n1 -K\n(To pay for the agents withdrawing at t = 1, δ-1(K -L) < I units of the illiquid asset are\nliquidated.)\nL + δI\nK > L + δI\n⇒\nπ1(K) =\n,\nπ2(K) = 0.\nK\n(Even after liquidating all illiquid assets, there is not enough to meet all withdrawals.)\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nEquilibrium. Clearly, impatient agents are non-strategic: it is always dominant for them to\nwithdraw at t = 1.

We thus\npropose\nct = (1 -s)(1 + A -δ)kt\nkt+1 = s(1 + A -δ)kt\nwhere the coefficient s is to be determined and must satisfy s ∈(0, 1) for the solution to exist.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- It follows that\nct+1\nkt+1\nyt+1\n=\n=\nct\nkt\nyt\nso that consumption, capital and income all grow at the same rate.\n- To ensure perpetual growth, we thus need to impose\nβ (1 + A -δ) > 1,\nor equivalently A -δ > ρ. If that condition were not satisfied, and instead A -δ < ρ, then\nthe economy would shrink at a constant rate towards zero.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\n- From the resource constraint we then have\nct\nkt+1\n+\n= (1 + A\nδ),\nkt\nkt\n-\nimplying that the consumption-capital ratio is given by\nct = (1 + A\nkt\n-δ) -[β (1 + A -δ)]θ\nUsing ct = (1 -s)(1 + A -δ)kt and solving for s we conclude that the optimal saving rate is\ns = βθ (1 + A -δ)θ-1 .\nEquivalently, s = βθ(1+R)θ-1, where R = A-δ is the net social return on capital. Note that\nthe saving rate is increasing (decreasing) in the real return if and only if the EIS is higher\n(lower) than unit, and s = β for θ = 1.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Finally, to ensure s ∈(0, 1), we impose\nβθ (1 + A -δ)θ-1 < 1.\nThis is automatically ensured when θ ≤1 and β (1 + A -δ) > 1, as then s = βθ (1 + A -δ)θ-1 ≤\nβ < 1. But when θ > 1, this puts an upper bound on A. If A exceeded that upper bound,\nthen the social planner could attain infinite utility, and the problem is not well-defined.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\n1.2\nThe Competitive Economy\n- There is a large number of competitive firms, each with access to the same AK technology.\nThe equilibrium rental rate of capital and the equilibrium wage rate are then simply given by\nr = A\nand\nw = 0.\nwhile arbitrage between bonds and capital implies that the interest rate is R = r -δ = A -δ.\n- On the other hand, the Euler condition for the representative household gives\nct+1 = [β (1 + R)]θ .\nct\n- Following the same steps as in the neoclassical growth model, we conclude that the competitive\nmarket allocations coincide with the Pareto optimal ones. This is true only because the private\nand the social return to capital coincide.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nProposition 1 Consider an AK economy with CEIS preferences and suppose that (β, θ, A, δ) sat-\nisfy β (1 + A -δ) > 1 > βθ (1 + A -δ)θ-1 . Then, the equilibrium is pareto efficient and the econ-\nomy exhibits a balanced growth path. Capital, output, and consumption all grow at a constant rate,\nwhich is given by\nkt+1\nyt+1\nct+1\n=\n=\n= [β (1 + A\nkt\nyt\nct\n-δ)]θ > 1.\nConsumption and investment are given by\nct = (1 -s) (1 + A -δ) kt\nand\nkt+1 = s (1 + A -δ) kt.\nwhere\ns = βθ (1 + A -δ)θ-1 .\n- The growth rate is increasing in A, θ, and β. Differences in productivity or preferences may\nthus explain differences, not only in the level of output and the rate of investment, but also\nin rate of long-run growth.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\n1.3\nBeyond AK\n- The analysis here has assumed a single type of capital and a single sector of production. We\ncould consider multiple types of capital and multiple sectors. In essence, we can \"endogenize\"\nthe capital K and the productivity A--for example, in terms of physical versus human capital,\nintentional capital accumulation versus unintentional spillovers, innovation and knowledge\ncreation, etc. The level of productivity and the growth rate then depend on how the economy\nallocates resources across different types of capital and different sectors of production.\n- In the textbook, you can find a version of the Solow/Ramsey model with two types of capital,\nphysical (or tangible) and human (or intangible). If the production functions is homogenous\nof degree one in the pair of these two types of capital, then the economy is effectively an AK\neconomy, in the sense that as we double both types of capital we also double output. The\nlong-run growth behavior of this economy is then essentially the same as the one we have\nconsidered here. However, the important property to remember is that, because markets are\ncompetitive and there are no externalities, Pareto and competitive allocations coincide.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- In the next sections, we consider richer endogenous growth models that achieve two goals:\n- provide a deeper understanding of the process of technological growth (positive), shifting\nfocus in particular to the accumulation of new knowledge\n- open up the door to inefficiency in market allocations (normative), and hence to inter-\nesting policy implications\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\nLearning by Doing and Spillovers\n2.1\nMarket Allocations\n- Output for firm m is given by\nY m\nt\n= F (Km\nt , htLm\nt )\nwhere ht represents the aggregate level of human capital or knowledge.\n- ht is endogenously determined in the economy (as we will specify in a moment how) but it is\nexogenous from the perspective of either firms or households.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Firm profits are given by\nΠm\nt = F (Km\nt , htLm\nt ) -r\nm\ntKt -wtLm\nt\nThe FOCs give\nr\n=\nF\n(Km, h Lm\nt\nK\nt\nt\nt )\nwt\n=\nFL (Km\nt , htLm\nt ) ht\nUsing the market clearing conditions for physical capital and labor, we infer Km\nt /Lm\nt = kt,\nwhere kt is the aggregate capital labor ratio in the economy. We conclude that, given kt and\nht, market prices are given by\nrt\n=\nFK(kt, ht) = f ′(κt)\nwt\n=\nFL(kt, ht)ht = [f(κt) -f ′(κt)κt]ht\nwhere f(κ) ≡F(κ, 1) is the production function in intensive form and κt = kt/ht.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\n- Households, like firms, take wt, rt and ht as exogenous to their decisions. The representative\nhousehold maximizes utility subject to the budget constraint\nct + kt+1 + bt+1 ≤wt + (1 + rt -δ)kt + (1 + Rt)bt.\nArbitrage between bonds and capital imply Rt = rt -δ, while the Euler condition gives\nu′(ct)\n= β (1 + R\nr\n′\nt) = β(1 +\nt\nu (ct+1)\n-δ).\n- To close the model, we need to specify how ht is determined. Following Arrow and Romer,\nwe assume that knowledge accumulation is the unintentional by-product of learning-by-doing\nin production. We thus let the level of knowledge to be proportional to either the level of\noutput, or the level of capital:\nht = ηkt,\nfor some constant η > 0.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- It follows that the ratio kt/ht = κt is pinned down by\nκt = 1/η.\nLetting the constants A and ω be defined\nA ≡f ′(1/η)\nand\nω ≡f(1/η)η -f ′(1/η),\nwe infer that equilibrium prices are given by\nrt = A\nand\nwt = ωkt.\nSubstituting into the Euler condition gives\nu′(ct)\n= β (1 + A\nu′(ct+1)\n-δ) .\n- Finally, it is immediate that capital and output grow at the same rate as consumption.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\nProposition 2 Let A ≡f ′(1/η) and ω ≡f(1/η)η -f ′(1/η), and suppose β (1 + A -δ) > 1 >\nβθ (1 + A -δ)θ-1 . Then, the market economy exhibits a balanced growth path. Physical capital,\nknowledge, output, wages, and consumption all grow at a constant rate given by\nyt+1\nct+1\n=\n= [β (1 + A\nyt\nct\n-δ)]θ > 1.\nThe wage rate is given by wt = ωkt, while the investment rate out of total resources is given by\ns = βθ (1 + A -δ)θ-1.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n2.2\nPareto Allocations and Policy Implications\n- Consider now the Pareto optimal allocations. The social planner recognizes that knowledge in\nthe economy is proportional to physical capital and internalizes the effect of learning-by-doing.\nHe thus understands that output is given by\nyt = F(kt, ht) = A∗kt\nwhere\nA∗≡A + ω = f(1/η)η\nrepresents the social return on capital. It is therefore as if the social planner had access to a\nlinear technology like in the simple Ak model, and therefore the Euler condition for the social\nplanner is given by\nu′(ct)\n= β (1 + A∗\n.\nu′(ct+1\n-δ)\n)\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\n- The social return to capital is higher than the private (market) return to capital:\nA∗> A = rt\nThe difference is ω, the fraction of the social return on saving that is \"wasted\" as labor income.\nProposition 3 Let A∗≡A + ω ≡f(1/η)η and suppose β (1 + A∗-δ) > 1 > βθ (1 + A∗-δ)θ-1 .\nThen, the Pareto optimal plan exhibits a balanced growth path. Physical capital, knowledge, output,\nwages, and consumption all grow at a constant rate given by\nyt+1\nct+1\n=\n= [β (1 + A∗\nyt\nct\n-δ)]θ > 1.\nNote that A < A∗, and therefore the market growth rate is lower than the Pareto optimal one.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Exercise: Reconsider the market allocation and suppose the government intervenes by subsi-\ndizing either private savings or firm investment. Find, in each case, what is the subsidy that\nimplements the optimal growth rate. Is this subsidy the optimal one, in the sense that it\nmaximizes social welfare?\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\nR&D and Innovation\n- The economy is populated by a large number of \"entrepreneurs\". Each entrepreneur lives (is\npresent in the market) for 1 + T periods, where T is random. Conditional on being alive in\nthe present period, there is probability n that the entrepreneur will die (exit the market) by\nthe end of that period. n is constant over time and independent of age. In each period, a\nmass n of existing entrepreneurs dies, and a mass n of new entrepreneurs is born, so that the\npopulation is constant.\n- In the first period of life, the entrepreneur is endowed with the aggregate level of knowledge\nin the economy. In the first period of life, he also has a \"fresh mind\" and can engage in R&D\nactivity. In later periods of life, instead, he is too old for coming up with good new ideas and\ntherefore engages only in production, not innovation.\n- Young producers engage in R&D in order to increase the profits of their own productive\nactivities later in life. But individual innovation has spillover effects to the whole economy.\nWhen a mass of producers generate new ideas, the aggregate level of knowledge in the economy\nincreases proportionally with the production of new ideas.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n3.1\nR&D Technology\n- Let V j\nt+1 denote the value of an innovation for individual j realized in period t and implemented\nin period t+1. Let zj\nt denote the amount of skilled labor that a potential innovator j employes\nin R&D and q(zj\nt ) the probability that such R&D activity will be successful. q : R →[0, 1]\nrepresents the technology of producing innovations and satisfies q(0) = 0, q′ > 0 > q′′,\nq′(0) = inf, q′(inf) = 0.\n- The potential researcher maximizes\nq(zj\nt ) · V j\nt+1 -wt · zj\nt .\nIt follows that the optimal level of R&D is given by q′(zj\nt )V j\nt+1 = wt or\nzj\nt = g\nV j\nt+1/wt\n\nwhere the function g(v) ≡(q′)-(1/v) satisfies g(0) = 0, g′ > 0, g(inf) = inf. Note that z will\nbe stationary only if both V and w grow at the same rate.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\n3.2\nThe Value of Innovation\n- What determines the value of an innovation? For a start, let us assume a very simple structure.\nLet Aj\nt represent the TFP of producer j in period t. The profits from his production are given\nby\nΠj\nt = Aj\ntπ\nwhere π\nb\nb represents normalized profits. We can endogenize π, but we won't do it here for\nsimplicity.\n- When a producer is born, he automatically learns what is the contemporaneous aggregate\nlevel of technology. That is, Aj\nt = At for any producer born in period t. In the first period\nof life, and only in that period, a producer has the option to engage in R&D. If his R&D\nactivity fails to produce an innovation, them his TFP remains the same for the rest of his\nlife. If instead his R&D activity is successful, then his TFP increases permanently by a factor\n1 + γ, for some γ > 0.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- That is, for any producer j born in period t, and for all periods τ ≥t + 1 in which he is alive,\nAj\nτ =\n\nAt\nif his R&D fails\n(1 + γ)At\nif his R&D succeeds\n- It follows that a successful innovation generates a stream of \"dividends\" equal to γAtπ per\nperiod for all τ > t that the producer is alive. Therefore,\nb\ninf\nVt+1 =\nX 1 -n τ\n(γAtπb) = γvAt\n(1)\n1 + R\nτ=t+1\nwhere where R is the interest rate per period and\nb\ninf\nvb ≡\nX\n1 -\nτ\nn\nπ\nπ\n.\n1 + R\nR + n\nτ=1\n\n≈\nNote that the above would be an exact equality if\nb\ntime w\nb\nas continuous. Note also that v is\ndecreasing in both R and n.\nb\n- Remark: We see that the probability of \"death\" reduces the value of innovation, simply\nbecause it reduces the expected life of the innovation. Here we have taken n as exogenous\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\nfor the economy. But later we will endogenize n. We will recognize that the probability of\n\"death\" simply the probability that the producer will be displaced by another competitor who\nmanages to innovate and produce a better substitute product. For the time being, however,\nwe treat n as exogenous.\n3.3\nThe Cost of Innovation\n- Suppose that skilled labor has an alternative employment, which a simple linear technology\nof producing final goods at the current level of aggregate TFP. That is, if lt labor is used in\nproduction of final goods, output is given by Atlt. Since the cost of labor is wt, in equilibrium\nit must be that\nwt = At.\n(2)\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n3.4\nEquilibrium\n- Combining (1) and (2), we infer that\nVt+1 = γv\nwt\nIt follows that the level of R&D activity is the same\nb\nacross all new-born producers:\nzj\nt = zt = g (γv) .\n- The outcome of the R&D activity is stochastic for the\nb\nindividual. By the LLN, however, the\naggregate outcome is deterministic. The aggregate rate of innovation is simply\nλt = q(zt) = λ (γv)\nwhere λ (x) ≡q (g (x)) .\nb\n- It follows that the aggregate level of technology grows at a rate\nAt+1 = 1 + γλt = 1 + γλ (γv) .\nAt\nb\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\n- An increase in πb increases the incentives for R&D in the individual level and therefore results\nto higher rates of innovation and growth in the aggregate level. An increase in γ has a double\neffect. Not only it increases the incentive for R&D, but it also increase the spill over effect\nfrom individual innovations to the aggregate level of technology.\n- How does an increase in R or n affect the rates of innovation and growth?\n- What is aggregate output in the economy? It's the sum of the output of all entrepreneurs\nplus the output of workers not employed in R&D. Check that aggregate output grows at the\nsame rate as aggregate knowledge.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n3.5\nBusiness Stealing\n- Consider a particular market j, in which a producer j has monopoly power. Suppose now that\nthere is an outside competitor who has the option to engage in R&D in an attempt to create a\nbetter product that is a close substitute for the product of producer j. Suppose further that, if\nsuccessful, the innovation will be so \"radical\" that, not only it will increase productivity and\nreduce production costs, but it will also permit the outsider to totally displace the incumbent\nfrom the market.\n- Remark: Here we start seeing how both production and innovation may depend on the IO\nstructure. In more general versions of the model, the size of the innovation and the type\nof competition (e.g., Bertrand versus Cournot) determine what is the fraction of monopoly\nprofits that the entrant can grasp and hence the private incentives for innovation.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\n- What is the value of the innovation for this outsider? Being an outsider, he has no share\nin the market of product j. If his R&D is successful, he expects to displace the incumbent\nand grasp the whole market of product j. That is, an innovation delivers a dividend equal to\ntotal market profits, (1 + γ)Atπ, in each period of life. Assuming that the outsider also has a\nprobability of death (or displacem\ngiven by\nb\nent) equal to n, the value of innovation for the outsider is\ninf\nV out\nt+1\nX\n-\nτ\nn\n=\n\n[(1 + γ)Atπ] = (1 + γ)vAt\n1 + R\nτ=t+1\n- Now suppose that the incumbent also has the option to\nb\ninnovate is\nb\nlater periods of life. If he\ndoes so, he will learn the contemporaneous aggregate level of productivity and improve upon\nit by a factor 1 + γ. The value of innovation in later periods of life is thus the same as in the\nfirst period of life:\ninf\nV in\nt+1 =\nX\nτ\n1 -n\n[γAtπb] = γvbAt.\n1 + R\nτ=t+1\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Obviously, V out\nt+1 > V in\nt+1. This is because the incumbent values only the potential increase in\nproductivity and profits, while the outsider values in addition the profits of the incumbent.\nThis \"business-stealing\" effect implies that, ceteris paribus, that innovation will originate\nmostly in outsiders.\n- Remark: In the standard Aghion-Howitt model, as opposed to the variant considered here,\nonly outsiders engage in innovation. Think why this is the case in that model, and why this\nmight not be the case here. Then, find conditions on the technology q and the parameters of\nthe economy that would ensure in our model a corner solution for the insiders and an interior\nsolution for the outsiders. (Hint: you may need to relax the Inada condition for q.) We will\nhenceforth assume that only outsiders engage in innovation.\n- Remark: Things could be different if the incumbent has a strong cost advantage in R&D,\nwhich could be the case if the incumbent has some private information about the either the\ntechnology of the product or the demand of the market.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\n- Assuming that only outsiders engage in R&D, and using V out\nt+1/wt = (1 + γ)v, we infer that\nthe optimal level of R&D for an outsider is\nb\nzout\nt\n= zt = g ((1 + γ)v) .\nand therefore the aggregate rate of innovation is\nb\nλt = q(zt) = λ ((1 + γ)v)\nWe conclude that the growth rate of the economy is\nb\nyt+1\nAt+1\n=\n= 1 + γλ ((1 + γ)v .\nyt\nt\nb)\nA\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- We can now reinterpret the probability of \"death\" as simply the probability of being displace\nby a successful outside innovator. Under this interpretation, we have\nn = λ ((1 + γ)vb)\nand vb solves\nπ\nv = R + λ ((1 + γ)v)\n- Note that an increase in π\nb\nb\nb\nb will now increase vb by less than one-to-one, because the displacemen\nrate will also increase.\nd\nt\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Endogenous Growth\n3.6\nEfficiency and Policy Implications\n- Discuss the spillover effects of innovation...

      "content": "14.05 Lecture Notes\nInflation traps, and rules vs. discretion\nA large number of private agents play against a government.\nGovernment objective. The government objective is given by the following loss function:\nLgov =\n\n(y -y∗)2 + βπ2\nwhere y is the equilibrium level of output, y∗is the socially optimal (first-best) level, and π is the\ninflation rate. Welfare is thus assumed to decrease with the distance between actual and first-best\noutput, as well as with the rate of change in prices.\nPhilips curve. Let us denote the expected inflation by πe. Nominal wages are set so that the\nnominal wage w moves one to one with πe. The realized real wage is thus a decreasing function\nof the inflation surprise, namely difference between realized inflation π and expected inflation πe.\nSince lower labor costs stimulate output, we conclude that equilibrium output can be express as a\ndecreasing function of the inflation surprise:\ny = y + α(π -πe)\nThis positive relation between output and inflation (or the associated negative relation between\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nunemployment and inflation) is commonly referred to as the Philips curve. The variable y represents\nthe \"natural\" level of output--namely the level of output that obtains in equilibrium when monetary\npolicy targets price stability or, more generally, when πe = π. We assume y < y∗, which means that\nthe natural level of output is inefficiently low.\nPrivate agents. The agents set prices/wages so as to minimize the losses from any subsequent\ninflation surprises. Since these losses are increasing in the gap between actual and expected inflation,\nwe can represent that objective of the private agents with the following loss function:\nL\nmarket = (πe -π)\nPrivate agents then set πe so as to minimize the expectation of the above loss.\nInformation and timing. The agents move first, setting πe (or, equivalently, setting wages).\nThe government moves second, choosing π after agents have formed their inflation expectations and\nhave fixed wages.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes\nBest responses: government. The government choose π so as to minimize\nLgov =\n\n(y -y∗)2 + βπ2\nsubject to\ny = y + α(π -πe),\ntaking πe as given. Taking the FOC of this problem, and rearranging, we infer that the optimal\nchoice of π is given by\nα (y∗-y) + α2πe\nπ = g(πe) =\n.\nα2 + β\nYou can think of this as the best response of the government against any given πe chosen by the\nprivate sector. Note that g(0) > 0 and g′\n(π) =\nα\nα2+β ∈(0, 1).\nBest responses: private sector. The private agents choose πe so as to minimize\nE[Lmarket] = E\n\n(πe -π)2\n,\nwhere E is the rational expectations operator. The best response for the private sector is thus given\nby\nπe = E[π]\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nEquilibrium. Since private agents are rational, they can not be \"fooled\": they can not make\nsystematic mistakes when predicting inflation. Along with the simplifying assumption that there is\nno uncertainty, this implies that E[π] = π. That is, private agents can perfectly forecast inflation.\nWe infer that the equilibrium values of πe and π must solve\nπ = g(πe)\nand\nπe = π\nCombining, we get the following fixed-point relation for π:\nα (y∗\nπ\nπ = g(π\n-y) + α2\n) ≡\n.\nα2 + β\nRecall that g(0) > 0 (because we have assumed y < y∗) and g′(.) ∈(0, 1). Hence, there is a\nunique solution to π = g(π) and this is given by\nα (y∗\nπ = π\n-y)\n≡\n.\nβ\nIt follows that equilibrium equilibrium output is\ny = y.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes\nRules vs discretion. When the government is free to optimize over the choice of inflation,\nthe equilibrium is given by\nπ = π > 0\nand\ny = y\nNow suppose that, before the agents move and set their expectations, the government ties its hands\nand commits on perfect price stability (π = 0) no matter what. E.g., say the government hands its\nmonetary policy to an external authority (as it roughly happened when Greece and other Southern\nEuropean countries abandoned their currencies and let Germany, in effect, set π ≈0 under all\ncircumstances). Then, the private agents will now set πe = 0 = π, implying that the equilibrium is\nnow given by\nπ = 0\nand\ny = y\nClearly, this equilibrium is much better: it delivers exactly the same aggregate output with less\ninflation!\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nWhat is going on? Ex ante, the government would like to promise low inflation. Ex post, the\ngovernment has a desire to \"cheat\" and raise inflation, so as to reduce the \"output gap\", that is,\nthe gap between the equilibrium and the efficient level of output. But if the market expects the\ngovernment to deviate, then they will adjust their expectations of inflation up to the point that the\ncosts of extra inflation will be so high that the government will find it suboptimal to deviate. Hence,\nif the government has full \"discretion\" (freedom to choose π) and little \"internal commitment\", then\nthe economy ends up in a high-inflation trap. When this is the case, there is value for rules over\ndiscretion, for constitutional constraints on the conduct of monetary (and fiscal) policies, or for\nother ways to tie the government's hands.\nImportantly, this is true even if the government is\nentirely benevolent!\nThis illustrates the value of commitment... of tying one's hands... of central-bank indepen-\ndence... and some of the benefits of joining a currency union with a \"strong\" central bank.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.05 Intermediate Macroeconomics\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "14.05 Lecture Notes\nIntroduction and The Solow Model\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nMIT Department of Economics\nFebruary 20, 2013\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nPreliminaries\n- In the real world, we observe for each country time series of macroeconomic variables such as\naggregate output (GDP), consumption, investment, employment, unemployment, etc. These\nare the typical data that concern the macroeconomist.\n- We also observe certain patterns (correlations, stylized facts) either over time or in the cross-\nsection.\nFor example, here is a pattern in the time-series dimension: during booms and\nrecessions, output, consumption, investment and unemployment all move together in the\nsame direction. And here is a pattern in the cross-section: richer countries tend to have more\ncapital.\n- Understanding what lies beneath these patterns and deriving lessons that can guide policy is\nthe job of the macroeconomist. But \"understanding\" for the formal economist does not mean\njust telling a \"story\" of the short you can find in the financial news or the blogosphere. It\nmeans to develop a coherent, self-consistent, formal explanation of all the relevant observed\npatterns.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- To this goal, macroeconomists develop and work with mathematical models. Any such model\nabstracts from the infinity of forces that may be at play in the real world, focuses on a few\nforces that are deemed important, and seeks to work out how these forces contribute towards\ngenerating the observed patterns.\n- Any such model thus features abstract concepts that are meant to mimic certain aspects of\nthe world. There are \"households\" and \"firms\" in our models that are meant to be proxies\nfor real-world people and businesses. And they are making choices whose product at the\naggregate level is some times series for aggregate output, employment, etc. We thus end up\nwith a mathematical model that generates the kind of times series we also observe in the real\nworld. And by figuring how these times series are generated in the model, we hope to also\nunderstand some of the forces behind the actual macroeconomic phenomena.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- In this lecture note, we will go over our first, basic, mathematical model of the macroeconomy:\nthe Solow model. We are going to use this model extensively to understand economic growth\nover time and in the cross-section of countries. But we are also going to use it to standard\nunderstanding economic fluctuations and the economic impact of various policies. All in all,\nwe will thus see how a very simple--in fact, ridiculously simple--mathematical model can\ngive us a lot of insight about how the macroeconomy works.\n- On the way, we will also familiarize ourselves with formal notions that we will use in subsequent\nricher models, including the difference (or coincidence) between market outcomes and socially\noptimal outcomes.\n- In particular, we will start analyzing the model by pretending that there is a social planner, or\n\"benevolent dictator\", that chooses the static and intertemporal allocation of resources and\ndictates these allocations to the households and firms of the economy. We will later show that\nthe allocations that prevail in a decentralized competitive market environment coincide with\nthe allocations dictated by the social planner (under certain assumptions).\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Be aware of the following. To talk meaningfully of a benevolent social planner, we need to have\nwell specified preferences for the households of the economy. This is not going to be the case\nin the Solow model. Nevertheless, we will establish a certain isomorphism between centralized\nand decentralized allocations as a prelude to a similar exercise that we will undertake in the\nRamsey model, where preferences are going to be well specified. This isomorphism is going\nto be the analogue within the Solow model of an important principle that you should know\nmore generally for a wide class of convex economies without externalities and other market\nfrictions: for such economies, the two welfare theorems apply, guaranteeing the set of Pareto\nOptimal allocations coincides with the set of Competitive Equilibria.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nIntroduction and stylized facts about growth\n- How can countries with low level of GDP per person catch up with the high levels enjoyed by\nthe United States or the G7?\n- Only by high growth rates sustained for long periods of time.\n- Small differences in growth rates over long periods of time can make huge differences in final\noutcomes.\n- US per-capita GDP grew by a factor ≈10 from 1870 to 2000: In 1995 prices, it was $3300\nin 1870 and $32500 in 2000.1 Average growth rate was ≈1.75%. If US had grown with .75%\n(like India, Pakistan, or the Philippines), its GDP would be only $8700 in 1990 (i.e., ≈1/4 of\nthe actual one, similar to Mexico, less than Portugal or Greece). If US had grown with 2.75%\n(like Japan or Taiwan), its GDP would be $112000 in 1990 (i.e., 3.5 times the actual one).\n1Let y0 be the GDP per capital at year 0, yT the GDP per capita at year T, and x the average annual growth rate\nover that period. Then, yT = (1 + x)T y0. Taking logs, we compute ln yT -ln y0 = T ln(1 + x) ≈Tx, or equivalenty\nx ≈(ln yT -ln y0)/T.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- At a growth rate of 1%, our children will have ≈1.4 our income. At a growth rate of 3%, our\nchildren will have ≈2.5 our income. Some East Asian countries grew by 6% over 1960-1990;\nthis is a factor of ≈6 within just one generation!!!\n- Once we appreciate the importance of sustained growth, the question is natural: What can\ndo to make growth faster?\nEquivalently: What are the factors that explain differences in\neconomic growth, and how can we control these factors?\n- In order to prescribe policies that will promote growth, we need to understand what are the\ndeterminants of economic growth, as well as what are the effects of economic growth on social\nwelfare. That's exactly where Growth Theory comes into picture...\n2.1\nThe World Distribution of Income Levels and Growth Rates\n- As we mentioned before, in 2000 there were many countries that had much lower standards\nof living than the United States. This fact reflects the high cross-country dispersion in the\nlevel of income.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Figure 3.1 in the Barro textbook shows the distribution of GDP per capita in 2000 across\nthe 147 countries in the Summers and Heston dataset. The richest country was Luxembourg,\nwith $44000 GDP per person. The United States came second, with $32500. The G7 and\nmost of the OECD countries ranked in the top 25 positions, together with Singapore, Hong\nKong, Taiwan, and Cyprus. Most African countries, on the other hand, fell in the bottom 25\nof the distribution. Tanzania was the poorest country, with only $570 per person - that is,\nless than 2% of the income in the United States or Luxemburg!\n- Figure 3.2 shows the distribution of GDP per capita in 1960 across the 113 countries for which\ndata are available. The richest country then was Switzerland, with $15000; the United States\nwas again second, with $13000, and the poorest country was again Tanzania, with $450.\n- The cross-country dispersion of income was thus as wide in 1960 as in 2000. Nevertheless,\nthere were some important movements during this 40-year period.\nArgentina, Venezuela,\nUruguay, Israel, and South Africa were in the top 25 in 1960, but none made it to the top 25\nin 2000. On the other hand, China, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh grew\nfast enough to escape the bottom 25 between 1960 and 1970. These large movements in the\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\ndistribution of income reflects sustained differences in the rate of economic growth.\n- Figure 3.3 shows the cross-country distribution of the growth rates between 1960 and 2000.\nJust as there is a great dispersion in income levels, there is a great dispersion in growth rates.\nThe mean growth rate was 1.8% per annum; that is, the world on average was twice as rich\nin 2000 as in 1960. The United States did slightly better than the mean. The fastest growing\ncountry was Taiwan, with a annual rate as high as 6%, which accumulates to a factor of 10\nover the 40-year period. The slowest growing country was Zambia, with an negative rate at\n-1.8%; Zambia's residents show their income shrinking to half between 1960 and 2000.\n- Most East Asian countries (Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand, China,\nand Japan), together with Bostwana (an outlier as compared to other sub-Saharan African\ncountries), Cyprus, Romania, and Mauritus, had the most stellar growth performances; they\nwere the \"growth miracles\" of our times. Some OECD countries (Ireland, Portugal, Spain,\nGreece, Luxemburg and Norway) also made it to the top 20 of the growth-rates chart. On\nthe other hand, 18 out of the bottom 20 were sub-Saharan African countries. Other notable\n\"growth disasters\" were Venezuela, Chad and Iraq.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n2.2\nStylized Facts\nThe following are stylized facts that should guide us in the modeling of economic growth (Kaldor,\nKuznets, Romer, Lucas, Barro, Mankiw-Romer-Weil, and others):\n1. In the short run, important fluctuations: Output, employment, investment, and consumptio\nvary a lot across booms and recessions.\n2. In the long run, balanced growth: Output per worker and capital per worker (Y/L and K/L)\ngrow at roughly constant, and certainly not vanishing, rates. The capital-to-output ratio\n(K/Y ) is nearly constant. The return to capital (r ) is roughly constant, whereas the wage\nrate (w) grows at the same rates as output. And, the income shares of labor and capital\n(wL/Y and rK/Y ) stay roughly constant.\n3. Substantial cross-country differences in both income levels and growth rates.\n4. Persistent differences versus conditional convergence.\n5. Formal education:\nHighly correlated with high levels of income (obviously two-direction\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\ncausality); together with differences in saving rates can \"explain\" a large fraction of the\ncross-country differences in output; an important predictor of high growth performance.\n6. R&D and IT: Most powerful engines of growth (but require high skills at the first place).\n7. Government policies: Taxation, infrastructure, inflation, law enforcement, property rights and\ncorruption are important determinants of growth performance.\n8. Democracy: An inverted U-shaped relation; that is, autarchies are bad for growht, and democ-\nracies are good, but too much democracy can slow down growth.\n9. Openness: International trade and financial integration promote growth (but not necessarily\nif it is between the North and the South).\n10. Inequality: The Kunzets curve, namely an inverted U-shaped relation between income in-\nequality and GDP per capita (growth rates as well).\n11. Ferility: High fertility rates correlated with levels of income and low rates of economic growth;\nand the process of development follows a Malthus curve, meaning that fertility rates initially\nincrease and then fall as the economy develops.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n12. Financial markets and risk-sharing: Banks, credit, stock markets, social insurance.\n13. Structural transformation: agriculture→manifacture→services.\n14. Urbanization: family production→organized production; small vilages→big cities; extended\ndomestic trade.\n15. Other institutional and social factors: colonial history, ethnic heterogeneity, social norms.\nThe Solow model and its various extensions that we will review in this course seek to explain how\nall the above factors interrelate with the process of economic growth. Once we understand better\nthe \"mechanics\" of economic growth, we will be able, not only to predict economic performance\nfor given a set of fundamentals (positive analysis), but also to identify what government policies or\nsocio-economic reforms can promote social welfare in the long run (normative analysis).\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\nThe Solow Model: Centralized Allocations\n- The goal here is to write a formal model of how the macroeconomy works.\n- To this goal, we shall envision a central planner that takes as given the production possibilities\nof the economy and dictates a certain behavior to the households of the economy. As noted\nearlier, we will later see how the dynamics of this centralized, planning economy coincide with\nthe dynamics of a decentralized, market economy.\n- The \"inputs\" (or \"assumptions\") of the model are going to be a certain specification of the\naforementioned production possibilities and behavior.\n- The \"output\" (or \"predictions\") of the model will be the endogenous macroeconomic outcomes\n(consumption, saving, output, growth, etc.).\n- We will then be able to use this model to understand the observed macroeconomic phenomena,\nas well as to draw policy lessons.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n3.1\nThe Economy and the Social Planner\n- Time is discrete, t ∈{0, 1, 2, ...}. You can think of the period as a year, as a generation, or as\nany other arbitrary length of time.\n- The economy is an isolated island. Many households live in this island. There are no markets\nand production is centralized. There is a benevolent dictator, or social planner, who governs\nall economic and social affairs.\n- There is one good, which is produced with two factors of production, capital and labor, and\nwhich can be either consumed in the same period, or invested as capital for the next period.\n- Households are each endowed with one unit of labor, which they supply inelastically to the\nsocial planner. The social planner uses the entire labor force together with the accumulated\naggregate capital stock to produce the one good of the economy.\n- In each period, the social planner saves a constant fraction s ∈(0, 1) of contemporaneous\noutput, to be added to the economy's capital stock, and distributes the remaining fraction\nuniformly across the households of the economy.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- In what follows, we let Lt denote the number of households (and the size of the labor force)\nin period t, Kt aggregate capital stock in the beginning of period t, Yt aggregate output in\nperiod t, Ct aggregate consumption in period t, and It aggregate investment in period t. The\ncorresponding lower-case variables represent per-capita measures: kt = Kt/Lt, yt = Yt/Lt,\nit = It/Lt, and ct = Ct/Lt.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n3.2\nTechnology and Production Possibilities\n- The technology for producing the good is given by\nYt = F(Kt, Lt)\n(1)\nwhere F : R2\n+ →R+ is a (stationary) production function. We assume that F is continuous\nand (although not always necessary) twice differentiable.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- We say that the technology is \"neoclassical\" if F satisfies the following properties\n1. Constant returns to scale (CRS), a.k.a. homogeneity of degree 1 or linear homogeneity:2\nF(μK, μL) = μF(K, L),\n∀μ > 0.\n2. Positive and diminishing marginal products:\nFK(K, L) > 0,\nFL(K, L) > 0,\nFKK(K, L) < 0,\nFLL(K, L) < 0.\nwhere Fx ≡∂F/∂x and Fxz ≡∂2F/(∂x∂z) for x, z ∈{K, L}.\n3. Inada conditions:\nlim FK\n=\nlim FL = inf,\nK→0\nL→0\nlim FK\n=\nlim FL = 0.\nK→inf\nL→inf\n2We say that a function g : Rn\n+ →R is homogeneous of degree λ if, for every vector x ∈Rn\n+ and every scalar\nμ ∈R\nλ\na1\na2\n+, g(μx) = μ g(x). E.g., the function g(x) = x1 x2\nis homogenous of degree λ = a1 + a2.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- By implication of CRS, F satisfies\nY = F(K, L) = FK(K, L)K + FL(K, L)L\nThat is, total output equals the sum of the inputs times their marginal products. Equivalently,\nwe can think of quantities FK(K, L)K and FL(K, L)L as the contributions of capital and labor\ninto output.\n- Also by CRS, the marginal products F\nK and FL are homogeneous of degree zero.\nIt follows\nthat the marginal products depend only on the ratio K/L :\nK\nK\nFK(K, L) = FK\n\n, 1\n\nFL(K, L) = FL\nL\n\n, 1\nL\n\n- Finally, it must be that FKL > 0, meaning that capital and labor are complementary inputs.4\n3This is because of the more general property that, if a function is homogenous of degree λ, then its first derivatives\nare homogeneous of degree λ -1.\n4We say that two inputs are complementary if the marginal product of the one input increases with the level of\nthe other input.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Technology in intensive (or per-capita) form. Let\nY\nK\ny =\nand\nk =\n.\nL\nL\ndenote the levels of output and capital per head (or, equivalently, per worker, or per labor).\nThen, by CRS, we have that\ny = f(k)\n(2)\nwhere the function f is defined by\nf(k) ≡F(k, 1).\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Example: Cobb-Douglas production function\nF(K, L) = AKαL1-α\nwhere α ∈(0, 1) parameterizes output's elasticity with respect to capital and A > 0 parame-\nterizes TFP (total factor productivity).\nIn intensive form,\nf(k) = Akα\nso that α can also be interpreted as the strength of diminishing returns: the lower α is, the\nmore fastly the MPK, f ′(k) = αkα-1, falls with k.\nFinally, as we will see soon, α will also coincide with the income share of labor (that is,\nthe ratio of wL/Y ) along the competitive equilibrium. This will give us a direct empirical\ncounterpart for this theoretical parameter.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Let us now go back to a general specification of the technology. By the definition of f and\nthe properties of F, it is easy to show that f satisfies that following properties:\nf(0)\n=\n0,\nf ′(k)\n>\n0 > f ′′(k)\nlim f ′(k)\n=\nk→0\ninf,\nlim f ′(k) = 0\nk→inf\nThe first property means that output is zero when capital is zero. The second property means\nthat the marginal product of capital (MPK) is always positive and strictly decreasing in the\ncapital-labor ratio k. The third property means that the MPK is arbitrarily high when k is\nlow enough, and converges to zero as k becomes arbitrarily high.\n- Also, it is easy to check that\nFK(K, L) = f ′(k)\nand\nFL(K, L) = f(k) -f ′(k)k\nwhich gives us the MPK and the MPL in terms of the intensive-form production function.\n- Check Figure 1 for a graphical representation of a typical function f.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nFi\ngu\nre\n1 sh\no\nw\ns a\ngr\na\nphi\ncal representation of typica\nl function f.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n3.3\nThe Resource Constraint\n- Remember that there is a single good, which can be either consumed or invested. Of course,\nthe sum of aggregate consumption and aggregate investment can not exceed aggregate output.\nThat is, the social planner faces the following resource constraint:\nCt + It ≤Yt\n(3)\nEquivalently, in per-capita terms:\nct + it ≤yt\n(4)\n- Suppose that population growth is n ≥0 per period. The size of the labor force then evolves\nover time as follows:\nL\nt\nt = (1 + n)Lt-1 = (1 + n) L0\n(5)\nWe normalize L0 = 1.\n- Suppose that existing capital depreciates over time at a fixed rate δ ∈[0, 1]. The capital stock\nin the beginning of next period is given by the non-depreciated part of current-period capital,\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nplus contemporaneous investment. That is, the law of motion for capital is\nKt+1 = (1 -δ)Kt + It.\n(6)\nEquivalently, in per-capita terms:\n(1 + n)kt+1 = (1 -δ)kt + it\nWe can approximately write the above as\nkt+1 ≈(1 -δ -n)kt + it\n(7)\nThe sum δ+n can thus be interpreted as the \"effective\" depreciation rate of per-capita capital:\nit represents the rate at which the per-capita level of capital will decay if aggregate saving\n(investment) is zero.\n(Remark: The above approximation becomes arbitrarily good as the economy converges to\nits steady state. Also, it would have been exact if time was continuous rather than discrete.)\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n3.4\nConsumption/Saving Behavior\n- We will later derive consumption/saving choices from proper micro-foundations (well specified\npreferences). For now, we take a short-cut and assume that consumption is a fixed fraction\n(1 -s) of output:\nCt = (1 -s)Yt = (1 -s)F(Kt, Lt)\n(8)\nwhere s ∈(0, 1). Equivalently, aggregate saving is given by a fraction s of GDP.\n- Remark: in the textbook, consumption is defined as a fraction s of GDP net of depreciation.\nThis makes little difference for all the economic insights we will deliver, but be aware of this\nminor mathematical difference.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n3.5\nThe Aggregate Dynamics\n- In most of the growth models that we will examine in this class, the key of the analysis will\nbe to derive a dynamic system that characterizes the evolution of aggregate consumption and\ncapital in the economy; that is, a system of difference equations in Ct and Kt (or ct and kt).\nThis system is very simple in the case of the Solow model.\n- Combining the law of motion for capital (6), the resource constraint (3), and the technology\n(1), we derive the following dynamic equation for the capital stock:\nKt+1 -Kt = F(Kt, Lt) -δKt -Ct\n(9)\nThat is, the change in the capital stock is given by aggregate output, minus capital deprecia-\ntion, minus aggregate consumption.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Combining conditions (8) and (9), we get a simple difference equation for the capital stock:\nKt+1 = (1 -δ)Kt + sF(Kt, Lt)\n(10)\nAt the same time, the law of motion for labor gives another difference equation:\nLt+1 = (1 + n)Lt\n(11)\n- Taken together, these two conditions pin down the entire dynamics of the labor force and\nthe capital stock of the economy for any arbitrary initial levels (K0, L0): starting from such\nan initial point, we can compute the entire path {Kt, Lt} simply by iterating on conditions\n(10) and (11 ). Once we have this path, it is straightforward to compute the paths of output,\nconsumption, and investment simply by using the facts that Yt = F(Kt, Lt), Ct = (1 -s)Yt\nand It = sYt for all t.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- We can reach a similar result in per-capita terms. Using (6), (4) and (2), we get that the\ncapital-labor ratio satisfies the following difference equation:\nkt+1 = (1 -δ -n)kt + sf(kt),\n(12)\nStarting from an arbitrary initial k0, the above condition alone pins down the entire path\n{kt}inf\nt=0 of the capital-labor ratio. Once we have this path, we can then get the per-capita\nlevels of income, consumption and investment simply by the facts that\nyt = f(kt),\nct = (1 -s)yt,\nand\nit = syt\n∀t\n(13)\n- From this point and on, we will analyze the dynamics of the economy in per capita terms only.\nTranslating the results to aggregate terms is a straightforward exercise.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- We thus reach the following characterization of the planner's allocation for the Solow economy.\nProposition 1 Given any initial point k0 > 0, the dynamics of the planner's solution are given by\nthe path {kt}inf\nt=0 such that\nkt+1 = G(kt),\n(14)\nfor all t ≥0, where\nG(k) ≡sf(k) + (1 -δ -n)k.\nEquivalently, the growth rate of capital is given by\nk\nγt ≡\nt+1 -kt = γ(kt),\n(15)\nkt\nwhere\nγ(k) ≡sφ(k) -(δ + n), φ(k) ≡f(k)/k.\n- This result is powerful because it permits us to understand the entire macroeconomic dynamics\nsimply by studying the properties of the function G (or equivalently the function γ).\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n3.6\nSteady State\n- A steady state of the economy is defined as any level k∗such that, if the economy starts\nk0 = k∗, then kt = k∗for all t ≥1. That is, a steady state is any fixed point k∗of (14).\n- A trivial steady state is k = 0 : There is no capital, no output, and no consumption.\nwould not be a steady state if f(0) > 0. We are interested for steady states at which capi\noutput and consumption are all positive (and finite). We can then easily show the followi\nProposition 2 Suppose δ + n ∈(0, 1) and s ∈(0, 1). A steady state with k∗> 0 exists an\nunique.\nwith\nThis\ntal,\nng:\nd is\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\nProof. k∗is a steady state if and only if it solves\nk∗= G(k∗)\nEquivalently\nsf(k∗) = (δ + n)k∗,\nor\nδ + n\nφ(k∗) =\n(16)\ns\nwhere the function φ gives the output-to-capital ratio in the economy (equivalently, the average\nproduct of capital):\nf(k)\nφ(k) ≡\n.\nk\nWe infer that characterizing the steady state of the economy reduces to the simple task of\ncharacterizing the solution to equation (16). To do this, in turn, we simply need to study the\nproperties of the function φ.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nThe properties of f, which we studied earlier, imply that φ is continuous (and twice differen-\ntiable), decreasing, and satisfies the Inada conditions at k = 0 and k = inf:\nf ′(k)k\nφ′(k) =\n-f(k)\nF\n=\nk2\n-\nL < 0,\nk2\nφ(0) = f ′(0) = inf\nand\nφ(inf) = f ′(inf) = 0,\nwhere the last two properties follow from an application of L'Hospital's rule.\nThe continuity of φ and its limit properties guarantee that equation (16) has a solution if and\nonly if δ + n > 0 and s > 0, which we have assumed. The monotonicity of φ then guarantees that\nthe solution is unique. We conclude that a steady-state level of capital exists, is unique, and is\ngiven by\nk∗= φ-1\nδ + n\ns\n\n,\nwhich completes the proof.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n3.7\nComparative statics of the steady state\n- We now turn to the comparative statics of the steady state. In order to study the impact of\nthe level of technology, we now rewrite the production function as\nY = AF(K, L)\nor, in intensive form,\ny = Af(k)\nwhere A is an exogenous scalar parameterizing TFP (total factor productivity).\nProposition 3 Consider the steady state.\nThe capital-labor ratio k∗and the per-capita level of income, y∗increase with the saving rate s\nand the level of productivity A, and decrease with the depreciation rate δ and the rate of population\ngrowth n.\nThe per-capital level of consumption, c∗, increases with A, decreases with δ and n, and is non-\nmonotonic in s.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nProof. By the same argument as in the proof of the previous proposition, the steady-state level\nof the capital-labor ratio is given by\nk∗= φ-1\nδ + n\n.\nsA\n\nRecall that φ is a decreasing function. It follows from the Implicit Function Theorem that k∗is\na decreasing function of (δ + n)/(sA), which proves the claims about the comparative statics of\nk∗. The comparative statics of y∗then follow directly from the fact that y∗= Af(k∗) and the\nmonotonicity of f. Finally, consumption is given by\nc∗= (1 -s)f(k∗).\nIt follows that c∗increases with A and decreases with δ + n, but is non-monotonic in s.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Example If the production functions is Cobb-Douglas, namely y = Af(k) = Akα, then φ(k) ≡\nf(k)/k = k-(1-α) and therefore\nsA\nα\n1-α\nsA\n1-α\nk∗=\n.y∗= A\n.\nδ + n\n\nδ + n\n\nEquivalently, in logs,\nα\nα\nlog y∗=\nlog A +\nlog s\nα\n1 -α\n-\nlog(δ + n)\n-\n1 -α\nNote that\n> 1, which means that, in steady state, output (and consumption) increases\n1-α\nmore than one-to-one with TFP. This is simply because capital also increases with TFP, so\nthat output increases both because of the direct effect of TFP and because of its indirect\neffect through capital accumulation.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n3.8\nTransitional Dynamics\n- The preceding analysis has characterized the (unique) steady state of the economy. Naturally,\nwe are interested to know whether the economy will converge to the steady state if it starts\naway from it. Another way to ask the same question is whether the economy will eventually\nreturn to the steady state if an exogenous shock perturbs the economy away from the steady\nstate. The following propositions uses the properties of the functions G and γ (defined in\nProposition 1) to establish that, in the Solow model, convergence to the steady is always\nensured and is indeed monotonic.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\nProposition 4 Given any initial k0 ∈(0, inf), the economy converges asymptotically to the steady\nstate:\nlim kt = k∗\nt→inf\nMoreover, the transition is monotonic:\nk0 < k∗⇒k0 < k1 < k2 < k3 < ... < k∗\nand\nk0 > k∗⇒k0 > k1 > k2 > k3 > ... > k∗\nFinally, the growth rate γt is positive and decreases over time towards zero if k0 < k∗, while it is\nnegative and increases over time towards zero if k0 > k∗.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nProof. From the properties of f, G′(k) = sf ′(k) + (1 -δ -n) > 0 and G′′(k) = sf ′′(k) < 0.\nThat is, G is strictly increasing and strictly concave. Moreover, G(0) = 0, G′(0) = inf, G(inf) = inf,\nG′(inf) = (1 -δ -n) < 1. By definition of k∗, G(k) = k iffk = k∗. It follows that G(k) > k\nfor all k < k∗and G(k) < k for all k > k∗. It follows that kt < kt+1 < k∗whenever kt ∈(0, k∗)\nand therefore the sequence {kt}inf\nt=0 is strictly increasing if k0 < k∗. By monotonicity, kt converges\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nasymptotically to some k ≤k∗. By continuity of G, k must satisfy k = G(k), that is k must be\na fixed point of G. But we already proved that G has a unique fixed point, which proves that\nˆk = k∗. A symmetric argument proves that, when k0 > k∗, {kt}inf\nt=0 is stricttly decreasing and again\nconverges asymptotically to k∗. Next, consider the growth rate of the capital stock. This is given\nby\nk\n≡\nt+1\nγt\n-kt = sφ(kt) -(δ + n)\nkt\n≡γ(kt).\nNote that γ(k) = 0 iffk = k∗, γ(k) > 0 iffk < k∗, and γ(k) < 0 iffk > k∗. Moreover, by diminishing\nreturns, γ′(k) = sφ′(k) < 0. It follows that γ(kt) < γ(kt+1) < γ(k∗) = 0 whenever kt ∈(0, k∗) and\nγ(kt) > γ(kt+1) > γ(k∗) = 0 whenever kt ∈(k∗, inf). This proves that γt is positive and decreases\ntowards zero if k0 < k∗and it is negative and increases towards zero if k0 > k∗.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Figure 2 depicts G(k), the relation between kt and kt+1. The intersection of the graph of G\nwith the 45o line gives the steady-state capital stock k∗. The arrows represent the path {kt}inf\nt=\nfor a particular initial k0.\n- Figure 3 depicts γ(k), the relation between kt and γt. The intersection of the graph of γ with\nthe 45o line gives the steady-state capital stock k∗.\n- The negative slope of the curve in Figure 3 (equivalently, the monotonic dynamics of the\ngrowth rate stated in the previous proposition) captures the concept of conditional conver-\ngence: if two countries have different levels of economic development (namely different k0\nand y0) but otherwise share the same fundamental characteristics (namely share the same\ntechnologies, saving rates, depreciation rates, and fertility rates), then the poorer country will\ngrow faster than the richer one and will eventually (asymptotically) catch up with it.\n- Discuss local versus global stability: Because φ′(k∗) < 0, the system is locally stable. Because\nφ is globally decreasing, the system is globally stable and transition is monotonic.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nFigu\nre\nd\nep\nic\nts\nG\n(k),\n\nt\nh\ne\n\nrelation between kt and kt+1.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\nF\nig\nur\ne 3 dep\nic\nts\n\n(k);\nth\ne\n\nr\nelation between kt and\nt: The intersection of the graph of\nwith the 45 line gives the steady-state capital stock k *.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nThe Solow Model: Decentralized Market Allocations\n- In the preceding analysis we characterized the centralized allocations dictated by a certain\nsocial planner.\nWe now characterize the allocations chosen by the \"invisible hand\" of a\ndecentralized competitive equilibrium.\n4.1\nHouseholds\n- Households are dynasties, living an infinite amount of time. We index households by j ∈[0, 1],\nhaving normalized L0 = 1. The number of heads in every household grow at constant rate\nn ≥0. Therefore, the size of the population in period t is Lt = (1 + n)t and the number of\npersons in each household in period t is also Lt.\n- We write cj\nt, kj\nt, bj\nt, ij\nt for the per-head variables for household j.\n- Each person in a household is endowed with one unit of labor in every period, which he supplies\ninelasticly in a competitive labor market for the contemporaneous wage wt. Household j is\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\nalso endowed with initial capital kj\n0. Capital in household j accumulates according to\n(1 + n)kj\nt+1 = (1 -δ)kj\nt + it,\nwhich we once again approximate by\nkj\nt+1 = (1 -δ -n)kj\nt + it.\n(17)\n- We assume that capital is owned directly by the households. But capital is productive only\nwithin firms. So we also assume that there is a competitive capital market in which firms rent\nthe capital from the households so that they can use it as an input in their production. The\ncapital market thus takes the form of a rental market and the per-period rental rate of capital\nis denoted by rt.\n- Note that this capital market is a rental market for real, physical capital (machines, buildings),\nnot for financial contracts (funds). We are abstracting from this kind of market and also\nabstracting from borrowing constrain and any other form of financial frictions (frictions in\nhow funds and resources can be channeled from one agent to another).\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- The households may also hold stocks of the firms in the economy. Let πj\nt be the dividends\n(firm profits) that household j receive in period t. As it will become clear later on, it is without\nany loss of generality to assume that there is no trade of stocks. (This is because the value\nof firms stocks will be zero in equilibrium and thus the value of any stock transactions will\nbe also zero.) We thus assume that household j holds a fixed fraction αj of the aggregate\nindex of stocks in the economy, so that πj\nj\nR\nt = α Πt, where Πt are aggregate profits. Of course,\nαjdj = 1.\n- Finally, there is also a competitive labor market, in which the households supply their labor\nand the firms are renting this labor to use it in their production. The wage rate (equivalently,\nthe rental rate of labor) is denotes by wt.\n- Note that both rt and wt are in real terms, not nominal: they are the rental prices of capital\nand labor relative to the price of the consumption good (which has been normalized to one).\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- The household uses its income to finance either consumption or investment in new capital:\ncj\nt + ij\nt = yj\nt.\nTotal per-head income for household j in period t is simply\nyj\nt = wt + rtkj\nt + πj\nt.\n(18)\nCombining, we can write the budget constraint of household j in period t as\ncj\nt + ij\nt = wt + rtkj\nt + πj\nt\n(19)\n- Finally, the consumption and investment behavior of each household is assumed to follow a\nsimple rule analogous to the one we had assumed for the social planner. They save fraction s\nand consume the rest:\ncj\nt = (1 -s)yj\nt\nand\nij\nt = syi\nt.\n(20)\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n4.2\nFirms\n- There is an arbitrary number Mt of firms in period t, indexed by m ∈[0, Mt]. Firms employ\nlabor and rent capital in competitive labor and capital markets, have access to the same\nneoclassical technology, and produce a homogeneous good that they sell competitively to the\nhouseholds in the economy.\n- Let Km\nt\nand Lm\nt\ndenote the amount of capital and labor that firm m employs in period t.\nThen, the profits of that firm in period t are given by\nΠm\nt = F(Km\nt , Lm\nt ) -rtKm\nt -wtLm\nt .\n- The firms seeks to maximize profits. The FOCs for an interior solution require\nFK(Km\nt , Lm\nt )\n=\nrt.\n(21)\nFL(Km\nt , Lm\nt )\n=\nwt.\n(22)\n- Remember that the marginal products are homogenous of degree zero; that is, they depend\nonly on the capital-labor ratio. In particular, F\nis a decreasing function of Km\nK\nt /Lm\nt and FL\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\nis an increasing function of Km\nt /Lm\nt . Each of the above conditions thus pins down a unique\ncapital-labor ratio Km/Lm\nt\nt . For an interior solution to the firms' problem to exist, it must be\nthat rt and wt are consistent, that is, they imply the same Km\nt /Lm\nt . This is the case if and\nonly if there is some Xt ∈(0, inf) such that\nrt\n=\nf ′(Xt)\n(23)\nwt\n=\nf(Xt) -f ′(Xt)Xt\n(24)\nwhere f(k) ≡F(k, 1); this follows from the properties\nFK(K, L) = f ′(K/L)\nand\nFL(K, L) = f(K/L) -f ′(K/L) · (K/L),\nwhich we established earlier.\n- If (23)-(24) are satisfied, the FOCs reduce to Km\nt /Lm\nt = Xt, or\nKm\nm\nt = XtLt .\n(25)\nThat is, the FOCs pin down the capital labor ratio for each firm (Km\nt /Lm\nt ), but not the size\nof the firm (Lm\nt ). Moreover, because all firms have access to the same technology, they use\nexactly the same capital-labor ratio.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Besides, (23)-(24) imply\nrtXt + wt = f(Xt).\n(26)\nIt follows that\nr Km + w Lm = (r X + w )Lm = f(X )Lm = F(Km, Lm\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt ),\nand therefore\nΠm\nt = Lm\nt [f(Xt) -rtXt -wt] = 0.\n(27)\nThat is, when (23)-(24) are satisfied, the maximal profits that any firm makes are exactly zero,\nand these profits are attained for any firm size as long as the capital-labor ratio is optimal If\ninstead (23)-(24) were violated, then either rtXt + wt < f(Xt), in which case the firm could\nmake infinite profits, or rtXt + wt > f(Xt), in which case operating a firm of any positive size\nwould entail strictly negative profits.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n4.3\nMarket Clearing\n- The capital market clears if and only if\nZ Mt\nKm\nt dm =\nZ\n(1 + n)tkj\ntdj\nEquivalently,\nZ Mt\nKm\nt dm = Kt\n(28)\nL\nwhere K\nt\nt ≡\nR\nkj\ntdj is the aggregate capital stock in the economy.\n- The labor market, on the other hand, clears if and only if\nZ Mt\nLm\nt dm =\nZ 1\n(1 + n)tdj\nEquivalently,\nZ Mt\nLm\nt dm = Lt\n(29)\nwhere Lt is the size of the labor force in the economy.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n4.4\nGeneral Equilibrium: Definition\n- The definition of a general equilibrium is more meaningful when households optimize their\nbehavior (maximize utility) rather than being automata (mechanically save a constant fraction\nof income). Nonetheless, it is always important to have clear in mind what is the definition\nof equilibrium in any model. For the decentralized version of the Solow model, we let:\nDefinition 5 An equilibrium of the economy is an allocation {(kj, cj, ij)\n, (Km, Lm\nt\nt\nt j∈[0,1]\nt\nt )m [0,Mt]}t\ninf,\n∈\n=0\na distribution of profits {(πj\nt)j [0,1]}, and a price path {rt, wt}t\ninf\nsuch\n∈\n=0\nthat\n(i) Given {rt, wt}inf\nt=0 and {πj\nt}inf\nt=0, the path {kj\nt, cj\nt, ij\nt} is consistent with the behavior of household\nj, for every j.\n(ii) (Km\nt , Lm\nt ) maximizes firm profits, for every m and t.\n(iii) The capital and labor markets clear in every period\n(iv) Aggregate dividends equal aggregate profits.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n4.5\nGeneral Equilibrium: Existence, Uniqueness, and Characterization\n- In the next, we characterize the decentralized equilibrium allocations:\nProposition 6 For any initial positions (kj\n0)j [0,1], an equilibrium exists. The allocation of produc-\n∈\ntion across firms is indeterminate, but the equilibrium is unique as regards aggregate and household\nallocations. The capital-labor ratio in the economy is given by {kt}inf\nt=0 such that\nkt+1 = G(kt)\n(30)\nfor all t ≥0 and k0 =\nR\nkj\n0dj historically given, where G(k) ≡sf(k) + (1 -δ -n)k. Equilibrium\ngrowth is given by\nk\nγt ≡\nt+1 -kt = γ(kt),\n(31)\nkt\nwhere γ(k) ≡sφ(k) -(δ + n), φ(k) ≡f(k)/k. Finally, equilibrium prices are given by\nrt\n=\nr(kt) ≡f ′(kt),\n(32)\nwt\n=\nw(kt) ≡f(kt) -f ′(kt)kt,\n(33)\nwhere r′(k) < 0 < w′(k).\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nProof. We first characterize the equilibrium, assuming it exists.\nUsing Km\nm\nt = XtLt by (25), we can write the aggregate demand for capital as\nZ Mt\nt\nKm\nt dm = Xt\nZ M\nLm\nt dm\nFrom the labor market clearing condition (29),\nZ Mt\nLm\nt dm = Lt.\nCombining, we infer\nZ Mt\nKm\nt dm = XtLt,\nand substituting in the capital market clearing condition (28), we conclude\nXtLt = Kt,\nwhere Kt ≡\nR Lt kj\ntdj denotes the aggregate capital stock.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\nEquivalently, letting kt ≡Kt/Lt denote the capital-labor ratio in the economy, we have\nXt = kt.\n(34)\nThat is, all firms use the same capital-labor ratio as the aggregate of the economy.\nSubstituting (34) into (23) and (24) we infer that equilibrium prices are given by\nrt\n=\nr(kt) ≡f ′(kt) = FK(kt, 1)\nwt\n=\nw(kt) ≡f(kt) -f ′(kt)kt = FL(kt, 1)\nNote that r′(k) = f ′′(k) = FKK < 0 and w′(k) = -f ′′(k)k = FLK > 0. That is, the interest\nrate is a decreasing function of the capital-labor ratio and the wage rate is an increasing function\nof the capital-labor ratio. The first properties reflects diminishing returns, the second reflects the\ncomplementarity of capital and labor.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nAdding up the budget constraints of the households, we get\nCt + It = rtKt + wtL\nj\nt +\nZ\nπtdj,\nwhere\nR\nCt ≡\nR\ncj\ntdj and It ≡\nR\nij\nj\ntdj. Aggregate dividends must equal aggregate profits,\nπtdj =\nΠm\nt dj. By (27), profits for each firm are zero. Therefore,\nR\nR\nπj\ntdj = 0, implying\nCt + It = Yt = rtKt + wtLt\nEquivalently, in per-capita terms,\nct + it = rtkt + wt.\nFrom (26) and (34), or equivalently from (32) and (33), rtkt + wt = yt = f(kt). We conclude that\nthe household budgets imply\nct + it = f(kt),\nwhich is simply the resource constraint of the economy.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\nAdding up the individual capital accumulation rules (17), we get the capital accumulation rule\nfor the aggregate of the economy. In per-capita terms,\nkt+1 = (1 -δ -n)kt + it\nAdding up (20) across household, we similarly infer\nit = syt = sf(kt).\nCombining, we conclude\nkt+1 = sf(kt) + (1 -δ -n)kt = G(kt),\nwhich is exactly the same as in the centralized allocation.\nFinally, existence and uniqueness is now trivial. (30) maps any kt ∈(0, inf) to a unique kt+1 ∈\n(0, inf). Similarly\nR\n, (32) and (33) map any kt\nj\n∈(0, inf) to unique rt, wt ∈(0, inf). Therefore, given any\ninitial k0 =\nk0dj, there exist unique paths {kt}inf\nt=0 and {rt, wt}inf\nt=0. Given\nj\n{rt, wt}inf\nt=0, the allocation\n{kt, cj\nt, ij\nt} for any household j is then uniquely determined by (17), (18), and (20). Finally, any\nallocation (Km, Lm\nt\nt )m [0,Mt] of production across firms in period t is consistent with equilibrium as\n∈\nlong as Km\nt = ktLm\nt .\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- An immediate implication is that the decentralized market economy and the centralized dic-\ntatorial economy are isomorphic:\nCorollary 7 The aggregate and per-capita allocations in the competitive market economy coincide\nwith those in the dictatorial economy.\n- Given this isomorphism, we can immediately translate the steady state and the transitional\ndynamics of the centralized plan to the steady state and the transitional dynamics of the\ndecentralized market allocations:\nCorollary 8 Suppose δ + n ∈(0, 1) and s ∈(0, 1). A steady state (c∗, k∗) ∈(0, inf)2 for the\ncompetitive economy exists and is unique, and coincides with that of the social planner. k∗and y∗\nincrease with s and decrease with δ and n, whereas c∗is non-monotonic with s and decreases with\nδ and n. Finally, y∗/k∗= (δ + n)/s.\nCorollary 9 Given any initial k0 ∈(0, inf), the competitive economy converges asymptotically to\nthe steady state. The transition is monotonic. The equilibrium growth rate is positive and decreases\nover time towards zero if k0 < k∗; it is negative and increases over time towards zero if k0 > k∗.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- The bottom line is that the allocations that characterize the frictionless competitive equilib-\nrium coincide with those that characterize the planner's solution. The only extra knowledge\nwe got by considering the equilibrium is that we found the prices (wages, rental rates) that\n\"support\" the allocation as a decentralized market outcome, that is, that make this allocation\nindividually optimal in the eyes of firms and households. Keep this in mind: the planner's\nsolution is merely an allocation, a market equilibrium is always a combination of an allocation\nand of prices that support this allocation.\n- By finding the prices that support the planner's solution as a market equilibrium, we can\nthus make predictions, not only about the real macroeconomic quantities (GDP, investment,\nconsumption, etc) but also about wages, interest rates, and more generally market prices.\n- Finally, remember that all this presumes that we have a competitive market economy without\nexternalities and without any kind of friction to drive the equilibrium away from the planner's\nsolution. If we were to allow for, say, externalities or monopoly power, the equilibrium would\ndiffer from the planner's solution--and then we could start making sense of policies that seek\nto correct the underlying market inefficiencies. We will consider such situations in due course.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nThe Solow Model: Introducing Shocks and Policies\n- The Solow model can be used to understand business cycles (economic fluctuations).\n- To do this, we must first extend the model in a way that it can accommodate stochasticity\nin its equilibrium outcomes. This is done by introducing exogenous random disturbances in\nthe primitives of the model (technologies, preferences, etc). This means that we model the\n\"deeper origins\" of booms and recession as exogenous forces and then use the model to make\npredictions about how the endogenous macroeconomic variables respond over time to these\nexogenous disturbances.\n- In the sequel, we do this kind of exercise to predict the response of the economy to productivity\nshocks (changes in the production possibilities of the economy, taste shocks (changes in the\nsaving rate), and policy shocks (changes in government policies).\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n5.1\nProductivity (TFP) Shock\n- Let us introduce exogenous shocks to the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of the economy.\nTo this goal, we modify the production function as follows:\nYt = AtF(Kt, Lt)\nor, in intensive form,\nyt = Atf(kt)\nwhere At identifies TFP in period t.\n- We thus want to consider the possibility that At varies over time and to examine how the\neconomy responds to changes in At, according to our model. Before we do this, let us first\nshow that variation in At is not merely a theoretical possibility; it is an actual fact in US\ndata.\n- To this goal, suppose further that F takes a Cobb-Douglas form: F(K, L) = KαL1-α. It\nfollows that\nlog Yt = log At + α log Kt + (1 -α) log Lt\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nand therefore\n∆log At = ∆log Yt -α∆log Kt -(1 -α)∆log Lt\nwhere ∆Xt ≡Xt -Xt-1 for any variable X .\nNote that ∆log Yt is the growth rate of\nGDP, ∆log Kt is the change in capital (net investment), and ∆log Lt is the net change in\nemployment. For all these variables, we have readily available data in the US. Furthermore,\nunder the assumption of perfect competition, wt = AtFL(Kt, Lt). Given the Cobb-Douglas\nspecification, this gives\nwt = (1 -α)A\nα\nα\ntKt L-\nt\n= (1 -α)Yt/Lt\nand therefore\nw\n1 -\ntLt\nα =\nYt\nwhich means that 1 -α coincides with the income share of labor. In the US data, the income\nshare of labor is about 70%. It follows that α ≈.3. We conclude that the change in TFP can\nbe computed by using the available macro data along with the following equation\n∆log At = ∆log Yt -.3∆log Kt -.7∆log Lt\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\nIf you do this, you get a times series for ∆log At, the growth rate in TFP, that looks as in\nthe following figure.\n- There are two notable features in this figure. The first is that on average ∆At is positive.\nThis means that on average there is long-run technological progress: out of the same inputs,\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nwe get more and more output as time passes. The second is that ∆At fluctuates a lot around\nits trend and tends to be lower during recessions (periods highlighted by the white areas in\nthe figure) as opposed to normal times (grey areas in the figure).\n- This second systematic feature, that TFP tends to fall during recessions, motivates the exercise\nwe do here. We take for given that At fluctuates over time and study the model's predictions\nregarding how all other macroeconomic variables (output, investment, consumption) respond\nto such fluctuations in At. We are thus interested to see if the model makes reasonable and\nempirically plausible predictions about the cyclical behavior of these variables.\n- In particular, we know that, in the data, TFP, output, consumption and investment all fall\nduring recessions. In the model, we will only assume that TFP falls during recession. We\nthen ask whether the model predicts that output, consumption, and investment must fall in\nresponse to a fall in TFP.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Thus consider a negative shock in TFP. This shock could be either temporary or permanent.\nAlso, keep in mind this shock can be interpreted literally as a change in the know-how of\nfirms and the talents of people; but it could also be proxy from changes in the efficiency of the\nfinancial system and more generally in the efficiency of how resources are used in the economy.\n- Recall that the dynamics of capital are given by\nkt+1 = G(kt; At) = sAtf(kt) + (1 -δ -n)kt\nAs a result of the drop in At, the G function shifts down. If the drop in At is permanent, the\nshift in G is also permanent; if the drop in At is transitory, the shift in G is also transitory. The\nsame logic applies if we look at the γ function, which gives the growth rate of the economy.\nSee Figure 4.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Suppose now that the economy was resting at its steady state before the drop in At. At the\nmoment At falls, output falls by exactly the same amount, because at the moment resources\nare fixed and simply TFP has fallen. But the drop in output leads to a drop in investment,\nwhich in turn leads to lower capital stock in the future. It follows that after the initial shock\nthere are further and further reductions in output, due to the endogenous reduction in the\ncapital stock. In other words, the endogenous response of capital amplifies the effects of the\nnegative TFP shock on output. Furthermore, if at some point the TFP shock disappears and\nAt returns to its initial value, output (and by implication consumption and investment) do\nnot return immediately to their initial values. Rather, because the capital stock has been\ndecreased, it takes time for output to transit back to its original, pre-recession value. In this\nsense, the endogenous response of capital, not only amplifies the recessionary effects of the\nexogenous TFP shock, but it also adds persistence: the effects of the shock are felt in the\neconomy long time after the shock has itself gone away. Equivalently, recoveries take time.\n- The aforementioned dynamics are illustrated in Figure 5. The solid lines represent the response\nof the economy to a transitory negative TFP shock, which only lasts between t1 and t2 in the\nfigure. The dashed lines show what the response would have been in the case the shock were\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\npermanent, starting at t1 and lasting for ever.\neither temporarily or permanently. What are the effects on the steady state and the transi-\ntional dynamics, in either case?\n- See Figures 4 and 5 for a graphical representation of the impact of a (temporary) negative\nproductivity shock.\n- Taste shocks: Consider a temporary fall in the saving rate. The γ(k) function shifts down for\na while, and then return to its initial position.

The government\nspends resources without contributing to production or capital accumulation.\n- The resource constraint of the economy now becomes\nct + gt + it = yt = f(kt),\nwhere gt denotes government consumption. It follows that the dynamics of capital are given\nby\nkt+1 -kt = f(kt) -(δ + n)kt -ct -gt\n- Government spending is financed with proportional income taxation, at rate τ ≥0. The\ngovernment thus absorbs a fraction τ of aggregate output:\ngt = τyt.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Disposable income for the representative household is (1 -τ)yt. We continue to assume that\nconsumption and investment absorb fractions 1 -s and s of disposable income:\nct = (1 -s)(1 -τ)yt.\n- Combining the above, we conclude that the dynamics of capital are now given by\nkt+1\nγt =\n-kt = s(1\nτ\nt\n-)φ(kt)\nk\n-(δ + n).\nwhere φ(k) ≡f(k)/k. Given s and kt, the growth rate γt decreases with τ.\n- A steady state exists for any τ ∈[0, 1) and is given by\nk∗= φ-1\nδ + n\ns(1 -τ)\n\n.\nGiven s, k∗decreases with τ.\n- Policy Shocks: Consider a temporary shock in government consumption. What are the tran-\nsitional dynamics?\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n5.3\nProductive Government Spending\n- Suppose now that production is given by\nyt = f(kt, gt) = kα\nt gβ\nt ,\nwhere α > 0, β > 0, and α + β < 1. Government spending can thus be interpreted as\ninfrastructure or other productive services. The resource constraint is\nct + gt + it = yt = f(kt, gt).\n- We assume again that government spending is financed with proportional income taxation at\nrate τ, and that private consumption and investment are fractions 1 -s and s of disposable\nhousehold income:\ngt\n=\nτyt.\nct\n=\n(1 -s)(1 -τ)yt\nit\n=\ns(1 -τ)yt\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Substituting gt = τyt into yt = kα\nt gβ\nt and solving for yt, we infer\nα\nβ\nyt = k\n1-β τ 1\na\nb\nt\n-β ≡kt τ\nwhere a ≡α/(1 -β) and b ≡β/(1 -β). Note that a > α, reflecting the complementarity\nbetween government spending and capital.\n- We conclude that the growth rate is given by\nkt+1\nγt =\n-kt = s(1 -τ)τ bka-1\nk\nt\nt\n-(δ + n).\nThe steady state is\n1/(1\ns(1\nτ)τ b\n-a)\nk∗=\n\n-\n\n.\nδ + n\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Consider the rate τ that maximizes either k∗, or γt for any given kt. This is given by\nd [(1\ndτ\n-τ)τ b] = 0 ⇔\nbτ b-1 -(1 + b)τ b = 0 ⇔\nτ = b/(1 + b) = β.\nThat is, the \"optimal\" τ equals the elasticity of production with respect to government ser-\nvices. The more productive government services are, the higher their optimal provision.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\nThe Solow Model: Miscellaneous\n6.1\nThe Solow Model in Continuous Time\n- Recall that the basic growth equation in the discrete-time Solow model is\nkt+1 -kt = γ(kt)\nk\nt\n≡sφ( t)\nk\n-(δ + n).\nWe would expect a similar condition to hold under continuous time. We verify this below.\n- The resource constraint of the economy is\nC + I = Y = F(K, L).\nIn per-capita terms,\nc + i = y = f(k).\n- Clearly, these conditions do not depend on whether time is continuous or discrete. Rather, it\nis the law of motions for L and K that slightly change from discrete to continuous time.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Population growth is now given by\nL = n\nL\nand the law of motion for aggregate capital is\nK = I -δK\n- Let k ≡K/L. Then,\n\nk\nK\nL\n=\n-\n.\nk\nK\nL\nSubstituting from the above, we infer\nk = i -(δ + n)k.\nCombining this with\ni = sy = sf(k),\nwe conclude\nk = sf(k) -(δ + n)k.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Equivalently, the growth rate of the economy is given by\nk = γ(k) ≡sφ(k) -(δ + n).\n(35)\nk\nThe function γ(k) thus gives the growth rate of the economy in the Solow model, whether\ntime is discrete or continuous.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n6.2\nMankiw-Romer-Weil: Cross-Country Differences\n- The Solow model implies that steady-state capital, productivity, and income are determined\nprimarily by technology (f and δ), the national saving rate (s), and population growth (n).\n- Suppose that countries share the same technology in the long run, but differ in terms of saving\nbehavior and fertility rates. If the Solow model is correct, observed cross-country income and\nproductivity differences should be explained by observed cross-country differences in s and n,\n- Mankiw, Romer and Weil tests this hypothesis against the data. In it's simple form, the Solow\nmodel fails to explain the large cross-country dispersion of income and productivity levels.\n- Mankiw, Romer and Weil then consider an extension of the Solow model, that includes two\ntypes of capital, physical capital (k) and human capital (h). The idea is to take a broader\nperspective on how to map the model to reality.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Output is given by\ny = kαhβ,\nwhere α > 0, β > 0, and α + β < 1. The dynamics of capital accumulation are now given b\nk\n=\nsky -(δ + n)k\nh\n=\nshy -(δ + n)h\nwhere sk and sh are the investment rates in physical capital and human capital, respectivel\nThe steady-state levels of k, h, and y then depend on both sk and sh, as well as δ and n.\n- Proxying sh by education attainment levels in each country, Mankiw, Romer and Weil fin\nthat the Solow model extended for human capital does a pretty good job in explaining th\ncross-country dispersion of output and productivity levels.\ny\ny.\nd\ne\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n6.3\nLog-linearization and the Convergence Rate\n- Define z ≡ln k -ln k∗. We can rewrite the growth equation (35) as\nz = Γ(z),\nwhere\nΓ(z) ≡γ(k∗ez) ≡sφ(k∗ez) -(δ + n)\nNote that Γ(z) is defined for all z ∈R. By definition of k∗, Γ(0) = sφ(k∗) -(δ + n) = 0.\nSimilarly, Γ(z) > 0 for all z < 0 and Γ(z) < 0 for all z > 0. Finally, Γ′(z) = sφ′(k∗ez)k∗ez < 0\nfor all z ∈R.\n- We next (log)linearize z = Γ(z) around z = 0 :\nz = Γ(0) + Γ′(0) · z\nor equivalently\nz = λz\nwhere we substituted Γ(0) = 0 and let λ ≡Γ′(0).\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Straightforward algebra gives\nΓ′(z)\n=\nsφ′(k∗ez)k∗ez < 0\nf ′(k)k\nφ′(k)\n=\n-f(k)\nf ′(k)k\nf(k)\n= -1\nk2\n-f(k)\nk2\nsf(k∗)\n=\n(δ + n)k∗\n\nWe infer\nΓ′(0) = -(1 -εK)(δ + n) < 0\nwhere εK ≡FKK/F = f ′(k)k/f(k) is the elasticity of production with respect to capital,\nevaluated at the steady-state k.\n- We conclude that\nk = λ ln\nk\nk\nk∗\n\nwhere\nλ = -(1 -εK)(δ + n) < 0\nThe quantity\nλ is called the convergence rate.\n-\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Note that, around the steady state\n\ny\nk\n= εK\ny\n· k\nand\ny\nk\n= ε\ny∗\nK · k∗\nIt follows that\ny\ny\n= λ ln\ny\n\ny∗\n\nThus, -λ is the convergence rate for either capital or output.\n- In the Cobb-Douglas case, y = kα, the convergence rate is simply\n-λ = (1 -α)(δ + n),\nwhere α is the income share of capital. Note that as λ →0 as α →1. That is, convergence\nbecomes slower and slower as the income share of capital becomes closer and closer to 1.\nIndeed, if it were α = 1, the economy would a balanced growth path.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- In the example with productive government spending, y = kαgβ = kα/(1-β)τ β/(1-β), we get\n-λ =\n\nα\n1 -1 -β\n\n(δ + n)\nThe convergence rate thus decreases with β, the productivity of government services. And\nλ →0 as β →1 -α.\n- Calibration: If α = 35%, n = 3% (= 1% population growth+2% exogenous technological\nprocess), and δ = 5%, then -λ = 6%. This contradicts the data. But if α = 70%, then\n-λ = 2.4%, which matches the date.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n6.4\nBarro: Conditional Convergence\n- Recall the log-linearization of the dynamics around the steady state:\ny\ny\n= λ ln\n.\ny\ny∗\nA similar relation will hold true in the neoclassical growth model a la Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans.\nλ < 0 reflects local diminishing returns.\nSuch local diminishing returns occur even in\nendogenous-growth models. The above thus extends well beyond the simple Solow model.\n- Rewrite the above as\n∆ln y = λ ln y -λ ln y∗\nNext, let us proxy the steady state output by a set of country-specific controls X, which\ninclude s, δ, n, τ etc. That is, let\n-λ ln y∗≈β′X.\nWe conclude\n∆ln y = λ ln y + β′X + error\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- The above represents a typical \"Barro\" conditional-convergence regression: We use cross-\ncountry data to estimate λ (the convergence rate), together with β (the effects of the saving\nrate, education, population growth, policies, etc.) The estimated convergence rate is about\n2% per year.\n- Discuss the effects of the other variables (X).\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n6.5\nThe Golden Rule and Dynamic Inefficiency\n- The Golden Rule: Consumption at the steady state is given by\nc∗\n=\n(1 -s)f(k∗) =\n=\nf(k∗) -(δ + n)k∗\nSuppose the social planner chooses s so as to maximize c∗. Since k∗is a monotonic function\nof s, this is equivalent to choosing k∗so as to maximize c∗. Note that\nc∗= f(k∗) -(δ + n)k∗\nis strictly concave in k∗. The FOC is thus both necessary and sufficient. c∗is thus maximized\nif and only if k∗= kgold, where kgold solve\nf ′(kgold) -δ = n.\nEquivalently, s = sgold, where sgold solves\nsgold · φ (kgold) = (δ + n)\nThe above is called the \"golden rule\" for savings, after Phelps.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- Dynamic Inefficiency: If s > sgold (equivalently, k∗> kgold), the economy is dynamically\ninefficient: If the saving raised is lowered to s = sgold for all t, then consumption in all periods\nwill be higher!\n- On the other hand, if s < sgold (equivalently, k∗> kgold), then raising s towards sgold will\nincrease consumption in the long run, but at the cost of lower consumption in the short run.\nWhether such a trade-offbetween short-run and long-run consumption is desirable will depend\non how the social planner weight the short run versus the long run.\n- The Modified Golden Rule: In the Ramsey model, this trade-offwill be resolved when k∗\nsatisfies the\nf ′(k∗) -δ = n + ρ,\nwhere ρ > 0 measures impatience (ρ will be called \"the discount rate\"). The above is called\nthe \"modified golden rule.\" Naturally, the distance between the Ramsey-optimal k∗and the\ngolden-rule kgold increase with ρ.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Abel et. al.: Note that the golden rule can be restated as\nY\nr -δ =\n.\nY\n\nDynamic inefficiency occurs when r -δ < Y /Y, dynamic efficiency is ensured if r -δ >\nY /Y.

This implies also limk\nφ(k) = A. Then, as k\n→inf\n→inf,\nk\nk\nt ≡\nt+1\nγ\n-\nt\nkt\n→sA -(n + δ)\n- If sA < (n + δ), then it is like before: The economy converges to k∗such that γ(k∗) = 0. But\nif sA > (n + x + δ), then the economy exhibits diminishing but not vanishing growth: γt falls\nwith t, but γt →sA -(n + δ) > 0 as t →inf.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Consider the special case where f(k) = Ak (linear returns to capital). This is commonly\nreferred as the AK model. The economy then follows a balanced-growth path from the very\nbeginning. Along this path, the growth rate of consumption, output and capital are all equal\nto γ = sA -(n + δ) in all dates.\n- Note then that the growth rate depends both on \"preferences\" (through s) and on \"technol-\nogy\" (through A). Hence, the same forces that determined the long-run level of income in the\nSolow model now also determine the long-run rate of growth.\n- We will later \"endogenize\" A in terms of policies, institutions, markets, etc.\n- For example, Romer/Lucas: If we have human capital or spillover effects,\nyt = Atkα\nt h1-α\nt\n.\nIf (for reasons that we will study later) it happens that h is proportional to k, then we get\nthat y is also proportional to k, much alike in the simple AK model that we briefly mentioned\nearlier (i.e., the version of the Solow model with f(k) = Ak).\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Solow Model\n- In particular, let\nkt ≡kt + ht\ndenote the \"total\" capital of the economy and suppose that there exists a constant λ ∈(0, 1)\nsuch that\n\nkt = λkt\nht = λkt.\nThe we can write output as\n\nyt = Atkt.\nwhere\nAt ≡Atλα(1 -λ)1-α.\nrepresent the effective productivity of the \"total\" capital of the economy. Finally, assuming\nthat households save a fraction s of their income to \"total\" capital, the growth rate of the\neconomy is then simply\n\nγt = sAt -(δ + n).\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Clearly, this is the same as in the simple AK model, except for the fact that effective produc-\ntivity is now endogenous to the allocation of savings between the two types of capital (that\n\nis, At depends on λ).\n- Question: what is the λ that maximizes effective productivity and growth?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.05 Intermediate Macroeconomics\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Let us now shift the focus to\nlabor supply. To do this within our micro-founded, neoclassical framework, we only need to\nintroduce leisure as an additional good.\n- You have previously studied the static labor supply problem of a household that lives only\none period and decides how much labor to supply in that period. This looks as follows:\nmax U(c, z - e)\nc,i\ns.t. c = a + we\nwhere c is consumption, e is labor supply, z parameterizes the overall time that is available\nfor work or leisure, z = z - e is leisure, w is the wage, we is labor income, and a are assets or\nother sources of income.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\n- This can also be restated as\nmax U(c, z)\nc,i\ns.t. c + wz = a + wz\nThe above underscores that the real wage w is the relative price of the leisure good over the\nconsumption good, and that the \"wealth\" of the household includes both the endowment of\nconsumption goods, a, and the value of the endowment of time, z.\n- Set up the Lagrangian and let μ be the Lagrange multiplier. Assuming an interior solution\n(0 < z < z ), the FOCs with respect to c and z (or e) give, respectively,\nUc(c, z)\n= μ\nUz(c, z)\n= μw\nThe optimal consumption and labor supply decisions are then given by the solution of the\nabove two FOCs along with the budget constraint.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Combining the two FOCs we get\nUz(c, z) = w\nUc(c, z)\nwhich simply says that the MRS between consumption and leisure should be equate with the\nrelative price of leisure, which is the real wage w. Equivalently,\nUz(c, z) = wUc(c, z)\nwhich means that the disutility of an extra unit of labor is equated to the marginal utility of\nthe extra consumption afforded by the income generated.\n- Now suppose that the wage rate w increases. What happens to the optimal labor supply?\nOpposing income and substitution effects. The substitution effect (=the relative price of\nleisure went up) contributes to an increase in labor supply. The income effect (=the value of\nthe endowment of time went up) contributes to a decrease in labor supply. The overall effect\ndepends on weather income or substitution effects dominate. At the same time, consumption\nnecessarily increases, because both effects work in the same direction.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\n- To see this more clearly, take the special case in which\nU(c, z) = log c + γ log z.\nSuppose further that the household has no resources other than labor income (meaning a = 0).\nThen, the budget implies c = we and therefore\nU(c, z) = log w + log e + γ log( z - e)\nIt is then immediate that the optimal labor supply is given by e = e ∗, where\ne ∗ = arg max {log e + γ log( z - e)}\ni\nis invariant to w. This is therefore an example in which income and substitution effects\nperfectly offset each other, making labor supply insensitive to wealth.\n- But now suppose that a > 0. Then, it is easy to verify that e now increases with w. Intuitively,\nnow that the household has other sources of income, the wealth effect of a higher wage is\nrelatively weaker, and the substitution effect dominates. So, the richer the household (in\nterms of non-labor income), the more elastic its labor supply might be.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nMulti-period Labor Supply Problem\n- Consider now a household that lives for two periods. To simplify the exposition, set a0 = 0 and\nnormalize q0 = 1 (in which case q1 = 1/(1+R1)). Following similar steps as when we analyzed\nthe optimal consumption-savings problem, the intertemporal problem of the household can\nnow be formalized as follows:\nmax U(c0, z0) + βU(c1, z1)\ns.t.\nc0 + w0z0 + q1c1 + q1w1z1 = x0\nwhere\nx0 = w0z + q1w1\nNote that, for t ∈{0, 1}, wt is the relative price of leisure in period t relative to consumption\nin the same period, while q1 is the relative price of consumption in t = 1 relative to t = 0. It\nfollows that q1w1/w0 is the relative price of leisure at t = 0 relative to leisure at t = 0.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\n- Let μ be, once again, the Lagrange multiplier. The FOCs now give\nUc(c0, z0)\n= μ\n(1)\nUz(c0, z0)\n= μw0\n(2)\nβUc(c1, z1)\n= μq1\n(3)\nβUz(c1, z1)\n= μq1w0\n(4)\nThe optimal plan is given by the solution to the above FOCs together with the intertemporal\nbudget constraint.\n- From (1) and (2), we get\nUz(c0, z0) = w0Uc(c0, z0)\nand similarly from (1) and (2) we get\nUz(c1, z1) = w1Uc(c1, z1)\nThis is the \"static\" optimality condition for labor supply that we have encountered before,\nnow stated for each period.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- At the same time, combining (1) and (3) we get\nUc(c0, z0) = (1 + R)βUc(c1, z1),\nwhich is our familiar intertemporal Euler condition.\n- So far nothing essential new. However, not that the labor supply and saving decisions are\nnot disconnected. In particular, the household is now able to substituted leisure (and labor\nsupply) intertemporally: if he wishes, he can work had in one period, take a vacation in the\nfollowing period, and nevertheless sustain a high level of consumption in both periods by\nsaving much of his first-period labor income. By the same token, a certain intertemporal\noptimality condition holds for leisure (or labor supply) just as for consumption. To see this,\ncombine (2) and (4) to get\nUz(c0, z0)\nw0\n=\nβUz(c1, z1)\nq1w1\nThis simply says that the MRS between leisure at t = 0 and leisure at t = 0 is equated with\nthe relevant price ratio. Equivalently,\nw0\nUz(c0, z0) = β(1 + R)\nUz(c1, z1)\nw1\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Consumption and Saving\nwhich looks like our familiar Euler condition for consumption, except for two differences: it\nregards leisure rather than the consumption of goods; and the relative wage ratio of the two\nperiods shows up along with the interest rate.\n- Think now of the relative substitution effects. What happens to labor supply in each period\nwhen R increases? When w0 increases? When w1 increases?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.05 Intermediate Macroeconomics\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "14.05 Lecture Notes: Redistribution\nRedistribution as optimal social insurance\n- We now shift focus to the role of fiscal policy in redistributing income from the rich to the\npoor. To start with, we will take a normative perspective to redistribution. Think of agents\n\"behind the veil of ignorance\", that is, before they know whether they will be relatively tal\nented/lucky/rich or relatively untalented/unlucky/poor. To the extent that agents dislike\nincome risk, they would like to insure again the possibility that they happen to be untal\nented/unlucky/poor. Redistribution can then be viewed as a way to achieve this kind of\ninsurance. In other words, when the government redistributes income from the rich to the\npoor, the government plays, at least in part, the role of an insurance agency.\n- Ex post (say, at middle age), it might be painful for the rich to give out part of their income.\nBut ex ante (say, at birth), before agents know whether they well end up been rich or poor,\nredistribution offers insurance against the risk of ending up poor. In so doing, redistribution\nmay be socially desirable ex ante, even if ex post it is politically complicated.\n- Here, we assume away the political aspects of redistribution and focus on its role as optimal\nsocial insurance.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Simple, two-period model. Agents live only two period. During the first period, all agents are\nidentical and the economy makes a single choice: it sets up a tax-and-redistribution system.\nIn the second period, different agents get different realization of \"luck\" (random income),\ndecide how much to work, and consume.\n- Household preferences:\n\n1+E\nui = u(ci, ni) = - exp -ci -\nn\n1+E\ni\nwhere ci is consumption and ni is effort/labor supply\n- Household budget:\nci = (1 - τ)yi + T\nwhere τ is the tax rate on income and T is a lump-sum transfer.\n- Income is given by\nyi = ni + νi\nwhere νi is a random variable, drawn from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance\nσ2 .\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Redistribution\n- Substituting the budget and the income into the household's utility we get\n1+E\nui = - exp - (1 - τ)(ni + νi) + T - 1+E ni\nTaking the FOC with respect to ni gives the optimal effort as a decreasing function of the tax\nrate:\nni = (1 - τ)1/E\nNote that f, which parameterizes the elasticity of labor supply to the wage, controls the\ndistortionary effect of taxation: the higher the elasticity of labor supply, the stronger the\nnegative effect of higher taxes on labor supply.\n- For simplicity, I henceforth let f = 1, so that\nni = n = 1 - τ\nfor all i.\n\nZ\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- The government budget is given by\nG + T = τ\nyidi,\nwhere G is the exogenous level of government spending.\n- Using the fact that all agents choose ni = n = (1 - τ) and that the average realization of luck\nνi is zero, we get\nT = τ(1 - τ) - G\n- Note here that there is a Laffer curve: tax revenue increases with the tax rate τ as long as the\ntax rate is low enough (here, τ < 1/2), but it decreases once the tax rate exceeds a threshold.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Redistribution\n- Substituting these results into the household's income we get\nui = - exp - 2\n1 (1 - τ)2 + (1 - τ)νi + τ(1 - τ) - G\n- Consider now the expected utility of agent from the perspective of the first period, before\nthe realization of luck is known. Note that νi is Normally distributed with zero mean and\nvariance σ2 . Next, recall that if x is a Normally distributed random variable, then\nE[exp(x)] = exp E[x] + V ar[x]\nUsing these fact we conclude that the ex-ante utility of the household behind the veil of\nignorance is given by\nE[ui] = - exp - 1\n2 (1 - τ)2 - 1\n2 (1 - τ)2σ2 + τ(1 - τ) - G\n- Note that the above is decreasing in σ, reflecting risk aversion (or, equivalently, inequality\naversion). By the same token, an increase in τ can help increase ex-ante welfare in so far it\nreduces exposure to random income risk.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Now suppose that τ is chosen so as to maximize the ex-ante utility of the typical agent, as\nseen behind the veil of ignorance. Clearly, τ must maximize\n2 (1 - τ)2 - 2\n1 (1 - τ)2σ2 + τ(1 - τ)\nIt is then straightforward to check that the optimal τ increases with σ: the higher the ran-\ndomness/inequality in income, the higher the value of insurance, and the higher the optimal\nlevel of redistribution.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.05 Intermediate Macroeconomics\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "14.05 Lecture Notes: Ricardian Equivalence, Tax Smoothing, and Debt Management\nRicardian Equivalence\n- We seek to answer the following question: Suppose that the government raises government\nspending.\nThe extra spending can be financed either by raising taxes now, or by raising\npublic debt. Does the mixture of financing matters for economic activity? E.g., should we\nrun budget deficits along with fiscal stimuli, or should we strive for balanced budgets?\n- Note that we are not examining here the costs and benefits of higher government spending.\nInstead, we take for granted that G increases and asks merely whether it matters how this\nincrease in G gets financed.\n- To start, we will answer this question assuming that taxes are non-distortionary (as with lump\nsum taxes) and that financial markets are perfect (households can freely lend and borrow as\nmuch as they wish).\n- Thus consider a neoclassical economy as in the Ramsey model and in the equilibrium business\ncycle model we have studied.\nTake the representative household.\nThis household choses\nconsumption, saving, and labor supply (or leisure).\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- The household's preferences are given by\nτ\nmax\nX\nβtU(ct, lt)\nt=0\nwere ct is consumption, lt is labor supply, β is the discount factor, and U is a utility function.\nThe latter increasing and concave in c (people like consuming) and decreasing and convex in\nl (people dislike working).\n- It's per-period budget constraint is given by\ncj + aj\nj\nj\nj\nt\nt+1 = (1 + Rt)at + wtlt -Tt ∀t\nwhere at are the assets of the household and Tt are the taxes its pays to the government (net\nof any transfers it receives from it).\n- Finally, household assets are given by\nat = kt + bt\nwhere kt is the capital stock and bt is the stock of government debt.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Ricardian Equivalence, Tax Smoothing, and Debt Management\n- Following similar steps as when we studied optimal consumption smoothing (see my lecture\nnotes on consumption), we can show that the sequence of per-period budgets is equivalent to\nthe following intertemporal budget constraint:\nX\nτ\nqtct\nt=0\n≤x0\nwhere\nq\nqt ≡\nt\n=\n.\n(1 + R0)(1 + R1)...(1 + Rt)\n1 + Rt\nτ\nτ\nx0 = (1 + R0)a0 +\nX\nqtwtlt -\nX\nqtTt\nt=0\nt=0\nand a0 = k0 + b0.\n- Recall that qt represents the price of period-t consumption relative to period-0 consumption\n(I have normalized q0 = 1) and x0 represents the total present-value wealth of the household.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Consider now the government. It's per-period budget is given by\nRtbt + gt = (bt+1 -bt) + Tt\nOn the left-hand side, we have government spending plus the interest on outstanding debt.\nOn the right-hand side, we have tax revenue (net of any transfers) plus the money raised by\nnew debt issuances.\n- Similarly to the case of the household, the sequence of the government's per-period budgets\nconstraints is equivalent to the following intertemporal budget constraint:\nX\nτ\nτ\nqtgt + (1 + R0)b0 =\nt=0\nX\nqtTt\nt=0\nThat is, the present value of tax revenue (on the right hand side) must be just enough to\ncover the present value of government spending plus the initial value of outstanding debt.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Ricardian Equivalence, Tax Smoothing, and Debt Management\n- Substituting for Pτ\nt=0 qtTt from the government's intertemporal budget into the household's\nintertemporal budget, we infer that the present-value wealth of the household is given by\nτ\nτ\nx0 = (1 + R0)k0 +\nX\nqtwtlt\nt=0\n-\nX\nqtgt\nt=0\nIt is then immediate that the household's wealth is independent of either the outstanding level\nof public debt or the financing of government spending: x\nτ\n0 is independent of {bt, Tt}t=0. All\nthat matters is the present value of government spending, not how this is financed.\n- Since the representative household's budget constraint is independent of {bt, Tt}τ\nt=0, its optimal\nconsumption, saving, and labor supply decisions are also independent of this. Furthermore,\nthe representative firm's decisions are also independent. But if neither the households' nor\nthe firms' decisions are affected, then the equilibrium prices are also unaffected. We conclude:\nRicardian Equivalence. Suppose that markets are perfect and taxes are non-distortionary.\nThen, equilibrium allocations and prices are independent of either the initial level of public\ndebt, or the mixture of deficits and taxes that the government uses to finance government\nspending.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- What's going on. Suppose that the government decides to finance an increase in gt with a\nincrease in debt instead of an increase it Tt. This means that the government de-saves (i.e.,\nit runs a deficit). The households do not change their consumption, but they have to pay\nless taxes to the government. This means that they are saving more. In fact, private saving\nincreases by exactly the same amount as the reduction in government saving. A public-sector\ndeficit is thus perfectly offset by a private-sector surplus.\n- Note however how this argument hinges on the household's ability to save and lend freely. In\nparticular, suppose that households face tight borrowing constraints. These constraints may\nforce private consumption to be lower than the optimum. Think, e.g., of young or unemployed\nhouseholds who would like to borrow against their future labor income, but can't do so because\nof borrowing constraint. Suppose then that the government runs a deficit now, which means\nthat it shifts taxes from today to the future. Once again, the present-value wealth of the\nhouseholds still doesn't change. Nevertheless, because the households have to pay less taxes\ntoday, they are now able to afford higher consumption without having to borrow more. Since\nbefore the change in government policy consumption was depressed due to the borrowing\nconstraint, consumption may now increase.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Ricardian Equivalence, Tax Smoothing, and Debt Management\n- In effect, when the government runs a deficit, it relaxes the bite of the borrowing constraint\nfaced by the household. It follows that private consumption may now increase, and Ricardian\nequivalence breaks.\nIn this sense, tax rebates, transfers, and deficits may help stimulate\nconsumption and \"aggregate demand\".\n- Alternatively, suppose that household face tight borrowing constraints and the government\ndecided to run a deficit, not by reducing taxes today, but rather by increasing government\nspending. Will this stimulate consumption? Or will it crowd out consumption? If it is the\nlater case, will the crowding out be full or partial?\n- Finally, Ricardian equivalence breaks also when taxes are distortionary. In this case, when\nthe government runs a deficit, it effectively substitutes less distortions today against more\ndistortions in the future. As in the case of a consumer who seeks to smooth its consumption,\na benevolent government may then find it optimal to smooth tax distortions over time. This\nis what is often called \"tax smoothing.\" We will study this issue next.\n- To recap, as long as financial markets are perfect (no borrowing constraints) and taxes are no\ndistortionary, the timing of taxes and the financing of government spending are irrelevant.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nTax smoothing and debt management\n- As anticipated, the dynamic pattern of taxes and deficits ceases to be indeterminate once\ntaxes are distortionary.\n- To capture this idea, let's us abstract from capital and labor supply, and let us capture\nthe distortionary effects of taxation by assuming that collecting taxes is a costly activity (it\nwastes resources). This is meant to be a metaphor for the broader idea that higher taxes, by\ndistorting incentives for work and saving, end up reducing economic activity.\n- We thus assume that real income is given by\nyt = Y -Λ(Tt)\nwhere Y is a constant that defines the level of income in the absence of taxation, Tt is tax\nrevenue, and Λ is an increasing and convex function representing the resources wasted because\nof taxation (with Λ(0) = 0, Λ(.)′ > 0, Λ(.)′′ > 0).\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Ricardian Equivalence, Tax Smoothing, and Debt Management\n- The government budget constraint:\nRtbt + gt = (bt+1 -bt) + Tt\n- The household budget:\nct + bt+1 = (1 + Rt)bt + yt\n- Combing the two, and using the definition of yt, we reach the following representation of the\nresource constraint of the economy:\nct + gt = Y -Λ(Tt)\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Suppose now that the preferences of the household are linear in consumption:\nU =\nX\nβtU(ct)\nt\nwith\nU(c) = c\n- From the Euler condition we then immediately get that\nU ′(ct) = β(1 + Rt+1)U ′(ct+1)\n1 = β(1 + Rt+1)\nand therefore\nRt+1 = R = ρ\n\nρ ≡1-β\nβ\nThat is, the interest rate is constant over time and equated\n\nto the household's subjective\ndiscount rate.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Ricardian Equivalence, Tax Smoothing, and Debt Management\n- Now, let us take the sequence of government spending as given, and let us consider the\nproblem of a benevolent government that chooses the sequence of taxes and public debt so as\nto maximize social welfare (the life-time utility U of the representative household).\n- Using the facts that\nU(ct) = ct = yt -gt = Y -Λ(τt) -gt\nwe can express welfare as\nU =\nX\nβt [Y -Λ(τt)\ng\nt\n-\nt]\n- Next, using the fact that β(1 + Rt) = 1, or equivalently\nq\nt\nt = β ,\nand setting b0 = 0 for simplicity, we can restate the intertemporal government budget con-\nstraint as\nX\nβtgt =\nβtTt\nt\nX\nT\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- We can thus state the policy problem as\nmax\n=\nβt [Y\nΛ(τt)\ngt]\n{Tt} U\nX\nt\n-\n-\nsubject to\nX\nβtTt =\nT\nX\nβtgt\nt\n- Clearly, since both Y and {gt} is exogenous, the above problem is equivalent to the following:\nmin\n{Tt}\nsubject to\nX\nβt [Λ(τt)]\nt\nX\nβt\nˆ\nTt = G\nˆ\nwhere G ≡\nThe above\nP\nT\nt βtgt is the present value of government spending.\n-\nproblem has a simple interpretation: the government must choose the sequence\nof taxes (and deficits) so as to minimize the present value of the social cost of tax distor-\ntions, pretty much as a consumer chooses the sequence of consumption (and saving) so as to\nmaximize the present value of the utility of consumption.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Ricardian Equivalence, Tax Smoothing, and Debt Management\n- Note in particular that the present value of tax revenue,\nT βtTt, is pinned down by the\nˆ\npresent value of of government spending, G ≡\nt βtgt (whic\nP\nh is here treated as exogenous).\nIn this regard, the \"average\" deficit has to be\nP\nzero over time: if the government borrows at\nsome period, it has to pay back its debt at some other periods. However, the government\nis free to choose the timing of taxes and debt: it is free to run deficits in some periods and\nsurpluses in other periods.\n- The question of interest then is to understand what is the optimal strategy in terms of when\nto run deficits and when to runs surpluses. To do this, we first ask what is the optimal path\nof taxes over time. Once we figure out the optimal taxes, the optimal primary deficit/surplus\nof period t is given simply by the residual between the (exogenous) spending gt of that period\nand the (optimally chosen) tax revenue Tt of that period.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- To determine the optimal taxes, take the FOC of the government's optimization problem to\nget the following:\nΛ′(Tt) = λ ∀t\nwhere λ is the Lagrange multiplier on the government's intertemporal budget. And since Λ′\nis strictly increasing (the distortionary costs of taxation are convex in the level of taxation),\nwe conclude that the optimal policy is to equalize the tax rate across periods:\nTt = T ∗∀t\n- The level of T ∗\nP\nis then pinned down by the in\noral budget: using P\nˆ\ntertemp\nt βtTt = G ≡\nt βtgt from the intertemporal budget along with Tt = T ∗∀t from the aforementioned opti-\nmality condition, we get\nT ∗=\nt βtgt\n(1)\n1 -β\nwhich means that T ∗is equated to the annuit\nP\ny value of government spending.\n- Clearly, this is similar to how a consumer equates his optimal level of consumption with the\nannuity value of his income, when the interest rate equals the discount rate and consumption\nis perfectly smoothed.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Ricardian Equivalence, Tax Smoothing, and Debt Management\n- Now, suppose that\ngt = g\nfor all t. In this case, (1) reduces to\nT ∗= g\nand therefore the government runs a balanced budget in each period.\n- Starting from the above situation, suppose that suddenly (and for reasons exogenous to our\nanalysis here) government spending increases permanently to a new higher level:\ngt = g + ∆,\n∆> 0. Then, (??) gives\nT ∗∗= g + ∆\nwhich means that taxes shift up permanently and by the same amount as government spend-\ning, so that the government runs a balanced budget once again.\n- Permanent increases in government spending therefore lead to equal permanent increases in\ntaxes and no change in surpluses/deficits.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Now, suppose instead that there is a temporary increase in government spending. Think, e.g.,\nof a temporary fiscal stimulus lasting X years:\ngt = g + ∆for t = 0, ..., X -1 but gt = g ∀t > X.\nIn this case, (1) reduces to\n1 + β + ... + βX\nT ∗∗∗= g +\n∆\n1 -β\n- If the interest rate is a small number R (say, R is a couple percentage points) and the length\nX is also small (say, X is a couple of years), the above gives\nT ∗∗∗= g + RX · ∆\nwhere RX << 1. For example, with R = 0.025 and X = 2, we get that, during the two\nyears of the fiscal stimulus, the increase in taxes should be about only RX = 5% of the\ncontemporaneous increase ∆in government spending. That is, almost all the fiscal stimulus\nmust be financed with deficits. But after g returns to its normal level, taxes must remain\nhigher for ever, in order to run primary surpluses that will pay for the interest on the debt\nthat it got accumulate during the fiscal stimulus.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: Ricardian Equivalence, Tax Smoothing, and Debt Management\nt\nTt, gt\nTt\ngt\ndeficits\nsurpluses\nt = 0\nt = X\n←fiscal stimulus →\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.05 Intermediate Macroeconomics\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

In the Ramsey model, agents (and the planner) choose\nconsumption and investment optimally so as to maximize their utility (welfare).\n- In this section, we start the analysis of the neoclassical growth model by considering the opti-\nmal plan of a benevolent social planner, who chooses the static and intertemporal allocation\nof resources in the economy so as to maximize social welfare. We will later show that the\nallocations that prevail in a decentralized competitive market environment coincide with the\nallocations dictated by the social planner.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n1.1\nPreferences\n- preferences are defined over streams of consumption, c = {ct}inf\nt=0\n- we assume that preferences can be represented by the following intertemporal utility function:\ninf\nUt =\nX\nβτU(ct+τ)\nτ=0\n- β is called the discount factor, with β ∈(0, 1).\n- U is sometimes called the per-period utility or felicity function. we assume that U is strictly\nincreasing and strictly concave, with U ′(0) = infand U ′(inf) = 0.\n- usual specification with constant elasticity of intertemporal substitution (CEIS):\nc1-1/θ -1\nU(c) =\n,\n1 -1/θ\nwhere θ > 0 is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n1.2\nTechnology and the Resource Constraint\n- We abstract from population growth and exogenous technological change.\n- The resource constraint is given by\nct + it ≤yt\n- Let F(K, L) be a neoclassical technology and let f(κ) = F(κ, 1) be the intensive form of F.\nOutput in the economy is given by\nyt = F(kt, 1) = f(kt),\n- Capital accumulates according to\nkt+1 = (1 -δ)kt + it.\n(If there is positive population growth, re-interpret δ as the effective depreciation rate, δ + n)\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n- Combining the above, we can rewrite the resource constraint as\nct + kt+1 ≤f(kt) + (1 -δ)kt\n- Finally, we impose the following natural non-negativitly constraints:\nct ≥0,\nkt ≥0.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n1.3\nThe Planner's Problem (a.k.a. the Ramsey Problem)\n- The social planner chooses a plan {ct, kt+1}inf\nt=0 so as to maximize utility subject to the resource\nconstraint of the economy, taking initial k0 as given. Formally,\ninf\nmax\nX\nβtU(ct)\nt=0\nsubject to\nct + kt+1 ≤(1 -δ)kt + f(kt) ∀t ≥0,\nct ≥0,\nkt+1 ≥0 ∀t ≥0,\nk0 > 0 given.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n1.4\nSolving the Planner's problem\n- Let μt denote the Lagrange multiplier for the resource constraint. The Lagrangian of the\nsocial planner's problem is\ninf\nL =\nX\ninf\nβtU(ct) +\nt=0\nX\nμt [(1\nt=0\n-δ)kt + f(kt) -kt+1 -ct]\n- Let λt ≡β-tμt be the multiplier in period-t terms. We can then rewrite the Lagrangian as\nX\ninf\nL =\nβt {U(ct) + λt [(1 -δ)kt + f(kt)\nk\n=0\n-\nt+1 -ct]\nt\n}\n- We henceforth assume an interior solution--as long as kt > 0, interior solution is indeed\nensured by the Inada conditions on F and U.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- The FOC with respect to ct gives\n∂L = 0 ⇔U ′(ct) = λt\n∂ct\n- The FOC with respect to kt+1, on the other hand, gives the so-called Euler condition:\n∂L\n= 0 ⇔λt = β [1 -δ + f ′(kt+1)] λt+1\n∂kt+1\n- Finally, the FOC with respect to λt simply gives us back the resource constraint:\nct + kt+1 = (1 -δ)kt + f(kt)\n- The Lagrange multiplier λt measures the marginal value of wealth (or resources) in period\nt: if we exogenously give the economy ε units of the good during period t, where ε is small\nenough, welfare increases by approximately λtε.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n- Combining the above, we get the following alternative representation of the Euler condition:\nU ′(ct)\n= 1\nδ + f ′(kt+1).\nβU ′(ct+1)\n-\n- This condition imposes equality between the marginal rate of intertemporal substitution in\nconsumption and the corresponding marginal rate of transformation, which is simply the\nmarginal capital of capital net of depreciation (plus one).\n- Recall that we found a similar condition when we studied the optimal consumption/saving of\na single individual. The only difference is that there the rate at which the individual could\nsubstitute consumption today for consumption tomorrow was given by the market interest\nrate, while here the rare at which the economy as a whole (the planner) can substitute con-\nsumption today for consumption tomorrow is given by the MPK (marginal product of capital)\nnet of depreciation. This observation also anticipates that the socially optimal allocation can\nbe replicated as a competitive market equilibrium in which the interest rate is equate with\nthe net-of-depreciation MPK.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Suppose for a moment that the horizon was finite, T < inf. Then, the Lagrangian would be\nX\nT\nL =\nβt {U(ct) + λt [(1 -δ)kt + f(kt) -kt+1\nt\nt\n-c ]\n=0\n}\nand the Kuhn-Tucker condition with respect to kT+1 would give\n∂L\nand\nkT+1\n0, with complementary slackness;\n∂kT+1\n≥\n≥\nequivalently\nβTλ\n≥0 and k\n≥0,\nwith βT\nT\nT+1\nλTkT+1 = 0.\nThe latter means that either kT+1 = 0, or otherwise it better be that the shadow value of\nkT+1 is zero. When T = inf, the terminal condition βTλTkT+1 = 0 is replaced by the so-called\ntransversality condition:\nlim βtλtkt+1 = 0,\nt→inf\nwhich means that the (discounted) shadow value of capital converges to zero. Equivalently,\nlim βtU ′(ct)kt+1 = 0.\nt→inf\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n- One can show that the aforementioned transversality condition is both necessary and sufficient\n(along with the Euler condition). Summarizing the preceding analysis, we thus reach the\nfollowing.\nroposition 1 The plan {ct, kt}inf\nt=0 is a solution to the social planner's problem if and only if\nU ′(ct)\n= 1 -δ + f ′(kt+1),\n(1)\nβU ′(ct+1)\nkt+1 = f(kt) + (1 -δ)kt -ct,\n(2)\nr all t ≥0,\nk\nt\n0 > 0 given,\nand\nlim β Uc\n′(ct)kt+1 = 0.\n(3)\nt→inf\n- Note that this is essentially a system of two difference equations in two variables, ct and\nkt. In general, such a system admits multiple solutions: there are multiple paths of ct and\nkt that satisfy these two difference equations. Only one solution however satisfies the two\nrelevant boundary conditions, which are initial condition for capital and the aforementioned\ntransversality condition. This particular solution identifies the socially optimal plan.\nP\nfo\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Also note that the above two equation have a very simple interpretation. The second condition\nis simply the resource constraint, which summarizes feasibility. The first condition, on the\nother hand, is the FOC in the planner's problem, which therefore summarizes optimality.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n- This optimality condition gives, in effect, the optimal growth in consumption as a function\nof the marginal product of capital, the discount rate, and the elasticity of intertemporal\nsubstitution. To see this more clearly, suppose that preferences take the CEIS form,\nc1-1/θ\nU(c) =\n-\n.\n1 -1/θ\nThen, the planner's optimality condition (1) reduces to\nct+1 = {β[1 + f ′(k\nθ\nt+1)\nc\n-δ]\nt\n}\nIt is then evident that the optimal consumption growth is positive (ct+1/ct > 1) if and only if\nthe MPK net of depreciation exceeds the discount rate:\nct+1 > 1\n⇔\nβ[1 + f ′(kt+1) -δ] > 1\n⇔\nf ′(kt+1)\nct\n-δ > ρ\nwhere, recall, β ≡\n1 .\nFurthermore, for any given positive gap between the MPK and\n1+ρ\nthe discount rate, consumption growth is higher the higher the elasticity of intertemporal\nsubstitution, θ. This is for the same reasons as in the consumer's problem we had analyzed\nbefore, except that now you should think of the planner substituting consumption today versus\ntomorrow.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Turning now attention to the boundary conditions, note that capital is historically predeter-\nmined (k is a \"state\" variable). This immediately implies that the one boundary condition is\n\nsimply the exogenously given initial level of capital, k0 = k0.\n- By contrast, consumption is not historically predetermined (c is a \"control\" or \"jump\" vari-\nable).\nHence, the initial value of consumption, c0, is not exogenously given.\nInstead, c0\nmust be chose optimal so that the dynamics of consumption of capital satisfy an appropriate\nterminal condition.\n- If the time horizon had been finite, this terminal condition would simply be kT+1 = 0, with T\ndenoting the last period of life; that is, the planner would make sure that the economy eats\nall its capital before it dies. Now that the horizon is infinite, it is no more optimal to drive\ncapital to zero at any finite time. Instead, the appropriate terminal condition becomes the\n\"transversality\" condition, namely\nlim βtUc\n′(ct)kt+1 = 0.\nt→inf\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\nDecentralized Competitive Equilibrium\n- As discussed in class, the allocation chosen by the planner coincides with the unique equilib-\nrium allocation. This is merely an application of the two welfare theorems.\n- Thus, the preceding proposition also characterizes the equilibrium of the economy.\n- To see this more clearly, consider first the representative household.\nThis has the same\npreferences as the planner but faces a different constraint: the individual budget constraint\nhas to with market opportunities rather than technological constraints.\n- Thus consider a market structure where the typical household supplies its labor in a competi-\ntive labor market for a wage rate wt, can accumulate physical capital and rent it out to firms\nfor a rental rate rt, and can finally trade bonds for a (real) interest rate Rt.\n- The budget constraint is then give by\nct + kt+1 + bt+1 = (1 -δ)kt + rtkt + (1 + Rt)bt + wt\n(4)\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- We can thus write the representative household's problem as follows:\ninf\nmax\nX\nβtU(ct)\nt=0\nsubject to\nct + kt+1 + bt+1 = (1 -δ + rt)kt + (1 + Rt)bt + wt ∀t ≥0,\nct ≥0,\nkt+1 ≥0 ∀t ≥0,\nk0 > 0 given.\n- Following a similar procedure like the one we used to solve the planner's problem, we can\nshow that, in any interior allocation, the intertemporal optimality conditions for capital ac-\ncumulation is given by\nU ′(ct)\n= 1 -δ + rt\nβU ′\n+1\n(ct+1)\nand similarly the one for bond savings is given by\nU ′(ct)\n= 1 + R +1\nβU ′\nt\n(ct+1)\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n- It follows that, in equilibrium the return to bonds (the interest rate) and the return to capital\nmust be equal:\nRt = rt -δ\nIf this were not true, the household would have tried to arbitrage the difference, leading either\nto an infinite demand for bonds and an infinite accumulation of capital (in the case that\nRt < rt -δ) or no accumulation of capital (in the case that Rt > rt -δ). Hence, for an\nequilibrium to exist with positive and finite capital, it'd better be that Rt = rt -δ.\n- In what follows, we therefore impose Rt = rt -δ and concentrate on the remaining optimality\ncondition, which is\nU ′(ct)\n= 1 -δ + r\nU ′\nt+1\n(= 1 + Rt+1)\n(5)\nβ\n(ct+1)\nThis condition, along with the budget constraint and the appropriate boundary conditions,\ndetermine the optimal consumption and saving plan of the household for any given sequence\nof the wage rate and the rental rate of capital.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Turning to the firm's optimal behavior, note that this is exactly the same as in the Solow\nmodel: the firm takes the wage wt and the rental rate rt as given and seeks to maximize its\nprofit. From the analysis we did before, we thus know that the wage must satisfy\nwt = FL(kt, 1) = f(kt) -f ′(kt)kt,\nwhile the rental rate of capital must satisfy\nrt = FK(kt, 1) = f ′(kt)\nAnd, by implication,\nrtkt + wt = f(kt)\n- Combining the last condition with the household's budget constraint (4), and imposing market\nclearing in the bond market (which means bt = 0 since the net aggregate borrowing/lending\nfor a closed economy is zero), we reach the following condition:\nct + kt+1 = (1 -δ)kt + f(kt)\nThat is, we have shown that the equilibrium allocation satisfies the resource constraint of the\neconomy.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n- Next, combining the firm's optimality condition rt = f ′(kt) with the household's Euler condi-\ntion (5), we reach the following condition:\nU ′(ct)\n= 1\nδ + f ′(k\nβ\n′\nt+1)\nU (ct+1)\n-\nThat is, we have shown that the equilibrium allocation satisfies the planner's Euler condition.\n- Finally, the transversality condition for the household's problem is given by\nlim βtU ′(ct)(1 + rt\nδ) = 0\nt→inf\n-\nwhich together with rt = f ′(kt) gives us the planner's transversality condition.\n- We have thus shown that the equilibrium allocation satisfies all the conditions that characterize\nplanner's problem--and therefore that the equilibrium allocation coincides with the social\noptimal allocation, which is precisely a manifestation of the two fundamental welfare theorems.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nSteady State\nProposition 2 There exists a unique (positive) steady state (c∗, k∗) > 0. The steady-state values of\nthe capital-labor ratio, the productivity of labor, the output-capital ratio, the saving rate, the wage\nrate, the rental rate of capital, and the interest rate are all independent of the utility function U and\nare pinned down uniquely by the technology F, the depreciation rate δ, and the discount rate ρ. In\nparticular, the capital-labor ratio k∗equates the net-of-depreciation MPK with the discount rate,\nf ′(k∗) -δ = ρ,\nand is a decreasing function of ρ + δ, where ρ ≡1/β -1. Similarly,\nR∗= ρ,\nr∗= ρ + δ,\nw∗= FL(k∗, 1),\ny∗\nδk∗\nδ\ny∗= f(k∗),\n= φ(k∗),\ns∗=\n=\n,\nk∗\ny∗\nφ(k∗)\nwhere f(k) ≡F(k, 1) and φ(k) ≡f(k)/k.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n- Proof. The Euler condition in steady state reduces to\n1 = β[1 -δ + f ′(k∗)]\nor equivalently\nf ′(k∗) -δ = ρ\nwhere ρ is the discount rate (with β =\n1 ). That is, the steady-state capital-labor ratio is\n1+ρ\npinned down uniquely by the equation of the MPK, net of depreciation, with the discount\nrate. It follows that the gross rental rate of capital and the net interest rate are r∗= ρ + δ\nand R∗= ρ, while the wage rate is w∗= f(k∗) -f ′(k∗). The output-capital ratio are given\nby y∗= φ(k∗), where φ(k) ≡f(k)/k. By the resource constraint, the steady-state level of\nk∗\nconsumption is given by\nc∗= f(k∗) -δk∗\nFinally, net investment is zero, gross investment is δk∗, and saving rate is\nδk∗\nδ\ns∗=\n=\ny∗\nφ(k∗)\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- The comparative statics are trivial. For example, an increase in β leads to an increase in\nk = K/L, y = Y/L, and the saving rate s = δK/Y . We could thus reinterpret the exogenous\ndifferences in saving rates assumed in the Solow model as endogenous differences in saving\nrates originating in exogenous differences in preferences.\n- Homework: consider the comparative statics with respect to exogenous productivity or a tax\non capital income.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\nTransitional Dynamics\n- We now suppose that preferences exhibit constant elasticity of intertemporal substitution:\nc1-1/θ\nU(c) =\n-1,\n1 -1/θ\nwhere θ > 0 is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.\n- The Euler condition then reduces to\nct+1 = (β(1 + Rt+1))θ =\nct\nθ\n+ Rt+1\n,\n1 + ρ\nor equivalently\nln ct+1 -log ct ≈θ(Rt+1 -ρ)\nwhere Rt+1 = f ′(kt+1) -δ. Thus, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, θ, controls the\nsensitivity of consumption growth to the rate of return to savings.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nProposition 3 The equilibrium path {ct, kt}inf\nt=0 is given by the unique solution to\nct+1 = {β[1 + f ′(k\nθ\nt+)\nc\n-δ]\nt\n} ,\nkt+1 = f(kt) + (1 -δ)kt -ct,\nfor all t, with initial condition k0 > 0 given and terminal condition\nlim kt = k∗,\nt→inf\nwhere k∗is the steady state value of capital, that is, f ′(k∗) = ρ + δ.\n- Remark. That the transversality condition reduces to the requirement that capital converges\nto the steady state will be argued later, with the help of the phase diagram.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\nContinuous Time and Phase Diagram\n- We now want to consider the continuous-time version of the Ramsey model. This will facilitate\na very convenient graphical representation of the dynamics of the economy.\n- However, I will not set up and solve the continuous-time model itself. Instead, I will use a\nheuristic, to tell you how you can obtain the continuous-time dynamics from the discrete-time\nsystem we have derived so far.\n- Consider the Euler condition with CEIS preferences. Taking logs on both side, we get\nln ct+1 -ln ct = θ [ln β -ln(1 + f ′(kt+1) -δ).]\nNext, note that ln β = -ln(1 + ρ) ≈-ρ and ln[1 -δ + f ′(k)] ≈f ′(k) -δ. We thus obtain and\napproximation to the Euler condition as\nln ct+1 -ln ct ≈θ[f ′(kt+1) -δ -ρ].\nThis approximation turns out to be exact when time is continuous. Indeed, the continuous-\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\ntime version of the Euler condition is given by\nd ln c = θ[f ′(kt)\nδ\ndt\n-\n-ρ]\nEquivalently,\nc t = θ[f ′(kt)\nct\n-δ -ρ]\nwhich simply says that consumption growth is proportional to the difference between the\nMPK, net of depreciation, and the subjective discount rate. This condition is now in contin-\nuous time, but the economics are, of course, the same as before.\n- Next, consider the resource constraint. This can be rewritten as\nkt+1 -kt = f(kt) -δkt -ct,\nand its continuous-time version is\nkt = f(kt) -δkt -ct.\nThis simply says that the change in capital is given by net aggregate saving, which is GDP\nminus depreciation minus consumption.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n- We thus reach the following characterization of the optimal (and equilibrium) dynamics:\nProposition 4 Consider the continuous-time version of the model. The equilibrium path {ct, kt}t∈[0,inf)\nis the unique solution to\nc t = θ[f ′(kt)\nct\n-δ -ρ]\nkt = f(kt) -δkt -ct,\nfor all t, with k0 > 0 given and limt\nk\n→inf\nt = k∗, where k∗is the steady-state capital.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- We can now use the phase diagram to describe the dynamics of the economy. See Figure 3.1.\n-\n\nThe k = 0 locus is given by (c, k) such that\nk = f(k) -δk -c = 0\n⇔\nc = f(k) -δk\nOn the other hand, the c = 0 locus is given by (c, k) such that\nc = cθ[f ′(k) -δ -ρ] = 0\n⇔\nk = k∗or c = 0\n- The steady state is simply the intersection of the two loci:\n\nc = k = 0 ⇔{(c, k) = (c∗, k∗) or (c, k) = (0, 0)}\nwhere k∗≡(f ′)-1(ρ + δ) and c∗≡f(k∗) -δk∗.\n- We henceforth ignore the (c, k) = (0, 0) steady state and the c = 0 part of the c = 0 locus.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\nc(t)\nkgold\nk(t)\n!\"#$\nc'(0)\nc''(0)\nc(t)=0\nk(t)=0\nk*\nc(0)\n%&\nk\nFigure 3.1 (borrowed from Acemoglu 2008)\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- The two loci partition the (c, k) space in four regions. We now examine what is the direction\nof change in c and k in each of these four regions.\n- Consider first the direction of c. If 0 < k < k∗[resp., k > k∗], then and only then c > 0 [resp.,\nc < 0]. That is, c increases [resp., decreases] with time whenever (c, k) lies the left [resp.,\nright] of the c = 0 locus. The direction of c is represented by the vertical arrows in Figure 3.1.\n-\n\nConsider next the direction of k. If c < f(k) -δk [resp., c > f(k) -δk], then and only then\n\nk > 0 [resp., k < 0]. That is, k increases [resp., decreases] with time whenever (c, k) lies below\n\n[resp., above] the k = 0 locus. The direction of k is represented by the horizontal arrows in\nFigure 3.1.\n- We can now draw the time path of {kt, ct} starting from any arbitrary (k0, c0), as in Figure\n3.1. Note that there are only two such paths that go through the steady state. The one with\npositive slope represents the stable manifold or saddle path. The other corresponds to the\nunstable manifold. The equilibrium path of the economy for any initial k0 is given by the\nstable manifold. That is, for any given k0, the equilibrium c0 is the one that puts the economy\non the saddle path.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n- To understand why the saddle path is the optimal path when the horizon is infinite, note the\nfollowing:\n- Any c0 that puts the economy above the saddle path leads to zero capital and zero\nconsumption in finite time, thus violating the Euler condition at that time. Of course,\nif the horizon was finite, such a path would have been the equilibrium path. But with\ninfinite horizon it is better to consume less and invest more in period 0, so as to never\nbe forced to consume zero at finite time.\n- On the other hand, any c0 that puts the economy below the saddle path leads to so\nmuch capital accumulation in the limit that the transversality condition is violated.\nActually, in finite time the economy has crossed the golden-rule and will henceforth\nbecome dynamically inefficient. Once the economy reaches kgold, where f ′(kgold) -δ = 0,\ncontinuing on the path is dominated by an alternative feasible path, namely that of\nstopping investing in new capital and instead consuming c = f(kgold) -δkgold thereafter.\nIn other words, the economy is wasting too much resources in investment and it would\nbetter increase consumption.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Let the function c(k) represent the saddle path. In terms of dynamic programming, c(k)\nis simply the optimal policy rule for consumption given capital k. Equivalently, the optimal\npolicy rule for capital accumulation is given by\nk = f(k) -δk -c(k),\nwith the discrete-time analogue being\nkt+1 = G(kt) ≡f(kt) + (1 -δ)kt -c(kt).\n- Finally, note that, no matter the form of U(c), you can write the dynamics in terms of k and\nλ:\nλt\n=\nf ′(kt)\nδ\nρ\nλt\n-\n-\nkt\n=\nf(kt) -δkt -c(λt),\nwhere c(λ) solves Uc(c) = λ, that is, c(λ) ≡U -1\nc (λ). Note that Ucc < 0 implies c′(λ) < 0. As\nan exercise, draw the phase diagram and analyze the dynamics in terms of k and λ.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\nComparative Statics and Dynamic Responses\nWe will now consider how the economy responds to various changes in the environment.\n6.1\nChanges in the discount rate (willingness to save)\n- suppose that the discount factor β falls permanently (or equivalently the discount rate ρ\nincreases). think of this as a reduction in the willingness to save.\n-\n\nthe resource constraint of the economy is not affected by this change. as a result, the k = 0\nlocus does not change.\n- however, the Euler condition is affected: for any given MPK, the optimal consumption growth\nis lower the higher the discount rate. it follows that the c = 0 shifts to the left.\n- clearly, the new steady state is characterized by both a lower capital stock and a lower con-\nsumption.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- but what happens on impact? that is, starting from the old steady state, where ρ was low,\nhow does the economy responds over time to a permanent increase in ρ?\n- think about. the answer is that on impact consumption jumps up: people start eating their\nsavings. as a consequence, the economy starts de-accumulating capital, asymptotically con-\nverging toward the new steady state.\n- see Romer's textbook for a more detailed treatment of this exercise.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n6.2\nAdditive Endowment\n- Suppose that the representative household receives an endowment e > 0 from God, so that\nits budget becomes\nct + kt+1 = wt + rtkt + (1 -δ)kt + e\nAdding up the budget across households gives the new resource constraint of the economy\nkt+1 -kt = f(kt) -δkt -ct + e\nOn the other hand, optimal consumption growth is given again by\nct+1\n{\n′\n-\n}θ\n= β[1 + f (kt+1)\nδ]\nct\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Turning to continuous time, we conclude that the phase diagram becomes\nc t = θ[f ′(kt)\nct\n-δ -ρ],\nkt = f(kt) -δkt -ct + e.\n- In the steady state, k∗is independent of e and c∗moves one to one with e.\n-\n\nConsider a permanent increase in e by ∆e. This leads to a parallel shift in the k = 0 locus,\nbut no change in the c = 0 locus. If the economy was initially at the steady state, then k\nstays constant and c simply jumps by exactly e. On the other hand, if the economy was below\nthe steady state, c will initially increase but by less that e, so that both the level and the rate\nof consumption growth will increase along the transition. See Figure 3.2.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n}\nehigh\nelow\n∆e\n∆e{\nc\nk\nFigure 3.2\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n6.3\nTaxation and Redistribution\n- Suppose that the government taxes labor and capital income at a flat tax rate τ ∈(0, 1). The\ngovernment then redistributes the proceeds from this tax uniformly across households. Let Tt\nbe the transfer made in period t.\n- The household budget is\nct + kt+1 = (1 -τ)(wt + rtkt) + (1 -δ)kt + Tt,\nimplying\nUc(ct)\n= β[1 + (1\nr\nc(ct+1)\n-τ) t+1\nU\n-δ].\nThat is, the tax rate decreases the private return to investment. Combining with rt = f ′(kt)\nwe infer\nct+1 =\nct\n{\nθ\nβ[1 + (1 -τ)f ′(kt+1) -δ]} .\n- Adding up the budgets across household gives\nct + kt+1 = (1 -τ)f(kt+1) + (1 -δ)kt + Tt\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\nThe government budget on the other hand is\nTt = τ(wt + rtkt) = τf(kt)\nCombining we get the resource constraint of the economy:\nkt+1 -kt = f(kt) -δkt -ct\nObserve that, of course, the tax scheme does not appear in the resource constraint of the\neconomy, for it is only redistributive and does not absorb resources.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- We conclude that the phase diagram becomes\nc t = θ[(1 -τ)f ′(kt)\nct\n-δ -ρ],\nkt = f(kt) -δkt -ct.\n- In the steady state, k∗and c∗are decreasing functions of τ.\nA. Unanticipated Permanent Tax Cut\n-\n\nConsider an unanticipated permanent tax cut that is enacted immediately. The k = 0 locus\ndoes not change, but the c = 0 locus shifts right. The saddle path thus shifts right. See Figure\n3.3.\n- A permanent tax cut leads to an immediate negative jump in consumption and an immediate\npositive jump in investment. Capital slowly increases and converges to a higher k∗. Consump-\ntion initially is lower, but increases over time, so soon it recovers and eventually converges to\na higher c∗.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\nc\nk\nThigh\nTlow\nFigure 3.3\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nB. Anticipated Permanent Tax Cut\n- Consider a permanent tax cut that is (credibly) announced at date 0 to be enacted at some\ndate bt > 0. The difference from the previous exercise is that c = 0 locus now does not change\nimmediately. It remains the same for t < bt and shifts right only for t > t. Therefore, the\ndynamics of c and k will be dictated by the \"old\" phase diagram (the one corresponding to\nhigh τ) for t < bt and by the \"new\" phase diagram (the one corresponding to\nb\nlow τ) for t > t,\n- At t = bt and on, the economy must follow the saddle path corresponding to the new low τ\nb\n,\nwhich will eventually take the economy to the new steady state. For t < t, the economy must\nfollow a path dictated by the old dynamics, but at t = t the economy must exactly reach\nthe new saddle path. If that were not the case, the consumption path\nb\nwould have to jump\nat date t, which would violate the Euler condition (and th\nb\nus be suboptimal). Therefore, the\nequilibrium\nb\nc0 is such that, if the economy follows a path dictated by the old dynamics, it will\nreach the new saddle path exactly at t = bt. See Figure 3.4.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\nFigure 3.4\nThigh\nTlow\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- Following the announcement, consumption jumps down and continues to fall as long as the\ntax cut is not initiated. The economy is building up capital in anticipation of the tax cut. As\nsoon as the tax cut is enacted, capital continues to increase, but consumption also starts to\nincrease. The economy then slowly converges to the new higher steady state.\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n6.4\nProductivity Shocks: A prelude to RBC\n- We now consider the effect of a shock in total factor productivity (TFP). The reaction of\nthe economy in our deterministic framework is similar to the dynamic responses we get in a\nstochastic Real Business Cycle (RBC) model. Note, however, that here we consider the case\nthat labor supply is exogenously fixed. The reaction of the economy will be different with\nendogenous labor supply, whether we are in the deterministic or the stochastic case.\n- Let output be given by\nyt = Atf(kt)\nwhere At denotes TFP. Note that\nrt\n=\nAtf ′(kt)\nwt\n=\nAt[f(kt) -f ′(kt)kt]\nso that both the return to capital and the wage rate are proportional to TFP.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\n- We can then write the dynamics as\nc t = θ[Atf ′(kt)\nct\n-δ -ρ],\nkt = Atf(kt) -δkt -ct.\nNote that TFP At affects both the production possibilities frontier of the economy (the re-\nsource constrain) and the incentives to accumulate capital (the Euler condition).\n- In the steady state, both k∗and c∗are increasing in A.\nA. Unanticipated Permanent Productivity Shock\n-\n\nThe k = 0 locus shifts up and the c = 0 locus shifts right, permanently.\n- c0 may either increase or fall, depending on whether wealth or substitution effect dominates.\nAlong the transition, both c and k are increasing towards the new higher steady state.

Lump Sum Taxation\n- Suppose the government finances its expenditure with lump-sum taxes. The household budget\nis\ncj\nt + kj\nt+1 = w + r\nj\nt\ntkt + (1 -δ)kj\nt -Tt,\nimplying that the Euler condition remains\nU (cj\nc\nt)\nj\n= β[1 + rt+1 -δ] = β[1 + f ′(kt+1)\nUc(ct+1)\n-δ]\nThat is, taxes do not affect the savings choice.\nThe government budget is Tt = gt, where gt denotes government spending.\n-\n\n14.05 Lecture Notes: The Ramsey Model\n- The resource constraint of the economy becomes\nct + gt + kt+1 = f(kt) + (1 -δ)kt\nNote that gt absorbs resources from the economy.\n- We conclude\nc t = θ[f ′(kt)\nct\n-δ -ρ],\nkt = f(kt) -δkt -ct -gt\n- In the steady state, k∗is independent of g and c∗moves one-to-one with -g. Along the\ntransition, a permanent increase in g both decreases c and slows down capital accumulation.\n- Clearly, the effect of government spending financed with lump-sum taxes is isomorphic to a\nnegative endowment shock.\n\nGeorge-Marios Angeletos\nB. Distortionary Taxation\n- Suppose the government finances its expenditure with distortionary income taxation.

Ignore the non-negativity constraints (we can\ncheck them later), taking FOC (because of the concavity, FOC will be sufficient) we get\nβtu′(ct)(-1) + βt+1u′(ct+1)\n(1 -δ) + f′(kt+1)\n\n= 0\n∀t = 1...T -1\nu′(ct) = βu′(ct+1)\n(1 -δ) + f′(kt+1)\n\nThe idea is that if we have a plan {kt} and we decide to reduce consumption in period t\nby a small ε and use that to invest and accumulate capital for next period kt+1 + ε then we\n\ncan increase consumption next period by (1 -δ)ε + f′(kt+1)ε and keep kt+2 and the whole\nsubsequent plan unchanged:\ncˆt+1 = (1 -δ)kt+1 + f(kt+1) + (1 -δ)ε + f′(kt+1)ε -kt+2\nThe reduction in consumption at time t has a cost in utility u′(ct)ε and from the increase\nin consumption in period t + 1 we get βu′(ct+1) ((1 -δ) + f′(kt+1)) ε. It better be the case\nthat we cannot improve by picking a small ε (greater or smaller than zero), and this is what\nthe FOC condition captures: \"local deviations\"\nSo we have a second order diference equation for {kt}:\nz\n}|\nct\nk\n\nt\nu′ (1 -δ)kt + f( t) -kt+1\n{\nc\n= βu′ (1\nz\n-\n}|\n+1\nδ)kt+1 + f(kt+1) -kt+2\n{ (1 -δ) + f′(kt+1)\n\nwith an initial condition k0 given. We need a second \"boundary condition\". For the\nlast period T we have kT+1 = 0, so this has a unique solution {kt\n∗}. To understand this\ncondition take the FOC for kT+1:\nβT u′(cT )(-1) ≤0\nand\nkT+1 ≥0\nbecause the non-negativity constraint here can be binding (this is the Kuhn Tucker condi-\ntion), and with complementary slackness:\nβT u′(cT )(-1)kT+1 = 0\nSo if k\nT+1\nT+1 > 0, then β\nu′(cT )(-1) = 0 which cannot be. Hence, kT+1 = 0. Intuitively,\ncapital is worthless since the economy ends and we can't use it to produce consumption\ngoods.\n\nIf this condition failed, we could at some period t < T consume a little more ct + ε and\nobtain a little bit less capital next period but not make up for it with less consumption\nnext period (keep the same consumption for every consecutive period), so that instead of\nkeeping kt+2 unchanged, it would go down a little, and so would all the consecutive ks for\ns = t + 2...T. If the original consecutive capital levels ks were strictly positive (and this\nwill be the case for some t) this plan is still feasible, but better because we consumed more\nin one period and the same in all others! This is a \"global\" deviation.\nBecuase of the concavity, the FOC - including the Kuhn Tucker inequality - are sufficient.\nFinally, after building the solution, check that the non-negativity constraints we ignored\nare actually satisfied and we are done.\nInfinite Horizon T = inf.\nWith an infinite horizon T = inf, we don't have a \"last period\"\nand so we never want to have no capital. The second boundary condition becomes instead\na \"tranversality condition\":\nlim βtu′(ct)kt+1 = 0\nt→inf\nProving this is beyond the scope of this course, but the intuition is similar to the finite\nhorizon case: we don't want to accumulate capital for its own sake. The FOC conditions\nmake sure there are no \"local\" deviations (consuming a little bit less today and a little bit\nmore tomorrow), the \"transversality condition\" makes sure there is no \"global\" deviation,\nlike simply consuming more today (without reducing consumption in the future) and having\na little less capital in every consecutive period.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.05 Intermediate Macroeconomics\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
