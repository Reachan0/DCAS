      "content": "12.740 Paleoceanography Spring 2002\n\nProblem 2\n\nFactor analysis primer. The things you are expected to include in your answer are indicated numbered and in boldface,\ne.g. III.(2).\n\nI. Sample space primer. Given the species composition data:\n\nG.ruber G.sacculifer G.truncatulinoides N.pachyderma(L)\n\nSample 1 50 30 20 0\nSample 2 30 30 30 10\nSample 3 0 0 30 70\nSample 4 10 20 50 20\n\nI.(1) Calculate the species vectors in sample space, and I.(2) calculate the \"correlation coefficient\" (cosine of the\nangle between the species vectors in sample space) of the species relative to each other. Also I.(3) calculate the\n\"similarity coefficient\" (cosine of the angle between the sample vectors in species space).\n\nII. Eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis primer. You are given a Macintosh disk with 100 x,y,z data points and certain files\nwith which to examine them. The data will be explored using Viz!on within Microsoft Excel 98. It is assumed that you\nare minimally proficient at basic Macintosh operations (pointing, clicking, double-clicking, dragging, and quitting programs)\nor can find someone to tutor you in these. You can do the exercise on any computer that has these applications;\nhowever, Viz!on will not work on PCs. The Mac 7500 E34-211 can be used for this exercise.\n\nAlso, it should also be possible to do the Excel only portions (sans Viz!on) on PC Windows versions of Excel; if you want\nto try, ask me for the file on a 3.5\" PC disk.\n\nThe files in your disk are:\n\nDouble-clicking on any of these files will open them up.\n\n1. On the desktop of the Macintosh 7500 in E34-211, double click on the Problem Set 2 icon on the desktop. Double click\non the \"Launch Viz!on/Excel\" icon. After Excel opens, close the blank spreadsheet.\n\n2. Open the file Data.txt. Highlight the three columns (ABC). Click on Viz!on in the menu bar and select Vizualize 3\nColumns.\n\n3. Click on \"Click Me\" and select 3Quant. Select the x,y, and z axes by dragging them in turn from their listing on the right\nto their appropriate box on the left:\n\n(5) Click on \"View the data in a rotating plot\". Click on \"Add Color by: x\" (this makes the plot a little easier to follow when it\nis spinning)\n\n(6) You can expand the screen either by clicking on the expand bar or using the resizing handle on the lower right. When\nyou expand at first, the plot remains the same size. You can expand or contract the size of the plot by using the tool\nshown below. This tool works by pointing and clicking near the outer edge if you want to expand, and near the center if\nyou want to contract.\n\n(7) You start the plot spinning by using the (arrow) hand tool to click and drag (letting go) to give the plot a spin. You can\nalso click and drag without letting go to move it as you please. II.(1)Examine the data set and describe the\ncharacteristics you notice.\n\n2. Open the file Eigen-analysis (XL). Near the top of the screen you will see the correlation matrix:\n\nA\n\nx\ny\nz\nx\n0.93\n0.86\ny\n0.93\n0.88\nz\n0.86\n0.88\n\nImmediately below that matrix is a section where guesses for the eigenvalues can be entered (bold font), where the\ndeterminant of the matrix A-λI is calculated (outline\nfont), and where the pre-computed eigenvectors are shown (sshhaaddooww\nfont). You can change the guesses for the eigenvalues until you arrive at a solution (determinant€=€0.00\n). There are\nthree solutions (roots) to the characteristic cubic polynomial that arises from the A-λI determinant. You can arrive at your\nguesses to the roots by examining the graph that is located below the eigenvector section:\n\nCharacteristic Polynomial Equation\nλ\n-0.05\n-0.04\n-0.03\n-0.02\n-0.01\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n\nIf you would like to see this equation plotted on a different scale, you may change the scale axes of this graph by double-\nclicking on an axis and selecting the scale option, and entering the new values you wish for the scale. By interacting\nwith this graph and the calculation section above, II.(2) find the eigenvalues of the data set (to three\ndecimal places) and describe how you found them(*). Notice that when you find an eigenvalue, the numbers to\nthe right of the pre-computed eigenvector x (which are the elements of the column vector (A-λI)xx ) approach zero [note:\nthis assumes that you put the smallest eigenvalue in the top group and the largest in the bottom group].. What is the\n\nsum of the eigenvalues? This result is not a coincidence - the sum of the eigenvalues corresponds to the rank of the\nmatrix (the minimum number of orthogonal vectors required to span the sample space). II.(3) Divide the eigenvalues\nby the sum of the eigenvalues. These numbers are equal to the fraction of the total variance \"accounted\" for by the\neigenvector associated with that eigenvalue. II.(4) Look at the eigenvectors and describe the spatial location\nof each (i.e., where in the four x-y quadrants and what angle from the x-y plane (1° accuracy); e.g.: \"x positive, y\nnegative, 30° above the horizontal\").\n(* )[Note: if you are familiar with the \"Solver\" in Microsoft Excel, you can use it to find the roots - but note that this Newton-\nRapson solver requires that your initial guess be close to the correct answer).\n\nClose this file.\n\n3. Double click-on DataVec.txt. Open up the columns using Viz!on. This file illustrates the raw data set and normalized\neigenvectors from step 2. Notice that the eigenvectors are orthogonal and follow the principle axes of elongation of the\ndata set. Which eigenvalues are associated with each of these eigenvectors?\n\nIII. Factor analysis example. You are given a data set consisting of a subset of the Atlantic core top foram census (50\nsamples selected at random with data for G. ruber, G. sacculifer, G. bulloides, N. pachyderma (R), N. pachyderma (L).\nYou will follow the Q-mode factor analysis of this data set into three factors, and verify its correctness.\n\n1. The raw data (# of specimens of each species in a sample is given at the top of the spreadsheet. The sum of squares\n(for unit-length normalization) is calculated. You are also given estimates for sea surface temperature.\n\nImmediately below the raw data data is the row-normalized data, W:\n\nThe analysis then proceeds by calculation of the 5 x 5 minor Product Moment (mPM). Actually, you could also use the\nMajor Product Moment (50 x 50), but the calculations are obviously easier for the mPM.\n\nNote: If you move the cursor to any cell of a matrix, it will show the matrix formula used to generate the matrix.\n\nWe then calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Excel 5.0 will not do this calculation, so the mPM was transferred\nfrom Excel into Mathematica. Mathematica gives eigenvalues and eigenvectors as a result of the commands:\n\netc.\n.\n\nThe results were then copied back into Excel:\n\nrub\n\nIII.(1) Verify that these are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the MPM (i.e., demonstrate\northogonality of (A-λ) and I using the determinant of their product, as in section 2. above).\n\nThe next step is to throw away the lesser eigenvectors and retain the more important. This is now the matrix V:\n\nAt this point, we can calculate the factor loadings A=WF (remember the Singular Value Decomposition). These are the\nunrotated solutions, and we wish to simplify the factors by rotating the vectors so has to maximize the variance of the\ncolumns of the squares of each element of A (this is the Varimax criterion). This is done as a stepwise procedure for each\nof the three planes defined by the axes (plane 1-2, plane 1-3, and plane 2-3). A rotation of angle φjl in the j-l plane is\naccomplished by multiplying A by R, where\n\nR1-2:\n\ncos φ12 -sin φ12 0\nsin φ12 cos φ12 0\n0 0 1\n\nR1-3:\n\ncos φ13 0 -sin φ13\n0 1 0\nsin φ13 0 cos φ13\n\nR2-3:\n\n1 0 0\n0 cos φ23 -sin φ23\n0 sin φ23 cos φ23\n\nFirst we find the angle that maximizes the variance by\n\nmaximize by rotating in the 1-2 plane;\nmaximize by rotating in the 1-3 plane;\nmaximize by rotating in the 2-3 plane ;\n\n(repeat until solution converges...).\n\nThis has already been done in the spreadsheet, so you are looking at the optimally rotated factors:\n\nIII.(2) Verify that you can't improve the fit by rotating the factors any more:\nYou can change j and l and try putting in various angles of rotation. The current variance is indicated in the varimax cell,\nwhich you can compare to the one which was previously optimized.\n\nYou may examine the relationships between the factors and summer SST by clicking on the tabs:\n↓ ↓ ↓\n\nAnd you can examine the degree to which the three factors \"fit\" the row-normalized data by clicking on the tabs:\n↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓\n\nYou may have to use the forward/backward keys:\n\nIII.(3) In a few sentences, discuss the outcome of the factor analysis in relationship to fitting the raw\ndata and the relationship with temperature."

CO2 intro 2\n- In the early 1980's, it seemed that the Dye 3 Greenland ice core showed\nrelatively large, rapid (few hundred year) fluctuations in CO2 during glacial\nstadial/interstadial fluctuations. These were not observed in the high\nresolution Byrd Antarctic ice core, and it is now thought that these apparent\nhigh CO2 events were artifacts due to melt layers or interactions with dust.\n- So why did atmospheric CO2 change with the glacial/interglacial cycles? Is\nthe CO2 change a chicken or an egg in the progression of climate change?\n- Many ideas have been proposed; almost an equal number have been\ndisposed of (or is it deposed?). Speaking informally, it is as if theories on\nglacial/interglacial carbon dioxide are radioactive with ~2 year half-lives.\n- Despite this situation, there is much to be learned about CO2 in the ocean\nfrom those ideas, so a historical examination of them is still worthwhile.\n\nDigression: physical chemistry of CO2 in the ocean 1\nA.

Relevant equilibria (\"apparent\" thermodynamic constants). Because seawater is a \"high ionic strength\"\nsolution (i.e., it is very salty), conventional thermodynamic constants (activity coefficients, etc.) are difficult\nto define because of strong ionic interactions. But because the composition of seawater (for major ions) is\nconstant save for variations in total salt content, we can adopt \"apparent constants\" which incorporate the\nactivity coefficients and ion interactions into the \"apparent\" constant (denoted by '):\n[CO2(aq)]\ni.

This equation is then\nsolved with Newton-Rapson or similar method. For the range of values appropriate for seawater, simplifications\ncan be made that reduce this system of equations to a cubic polynomial with an exact solution.D. By expressing\nall species in terms of [H+], then combining into a single equation in [H+]), it can be shown that\nAssuming deviations within the range of values likely to be found in the ocean, the relationship can be expressed\nas a simple cubic equation which has an exact solution. Since the relative amount of the various CO2 species is a\nfunction of the pH, we can compute the absolute amount of each species as f(pH)*ΣCO2; or directly as f(Alk,\nΣCO2). The best formulation for CO2 system calculations under natural conditions is to solve the cubic hydrogen\nion equation approximation where Alk, ΣCO2, and borate are taken into account:\nLet A = Alk/ΣCO2 and B = ΣB/ΣCO2, let [H+] = the activity of hydrogen ion, and let K1', K2', and KB' be the\napparent constants in seawater at the appropriate temperature, pressure, and salinity; then:\n0 = [H+]3 A\n+ [H+]2 [K1'(A-1) + KB'(A-B)]\n+ [H+] [K1'KB'(A-B-1) + K1'K2'(A-2)]\n+ [K1'K2'KB'(A-B-2)]\npH = f ( Alk\nΣCO2\n,(T,S,P))\n\nCO2 exchange between the ocean and atmosphere\nRate of exchange of CO2 between ocean and atmosphere.

CO2 conc.\nconversion factor\nGiven that the upper 75 m of the water column (mixed layer) underneath a square meter contains 150\nmoles of carbon, full equilibration for carbon isotopes (e.g. 13C, 14C) can take some time (~10 years).\npCO2 equilibration takes less time however, because the pH shift induced by gas exchange shifts the\nwater towards equilibrium (e.g., if water is supersaturated with respect to atmosphere, CO2 is lost and\npH of seawater rises and some aqueous CO2 is lost to the bicarbonate pool. Hence pCO2 is moved\ntowards equilibrium both by loss of aqueous CO2 to atmosphere and by loss of aqueous CO2 to\nbicarbonate pool (this is related to the Revelle Factor).\nSimple Gas Exchange\n(e.g. O2, Ar)\n~2 weeks\n(depth of mixed\nlayer divided by\npiston velocity\n- i.e. total gas\ncontent divided\nby gas flux)\npCO2 equilibration\n~1 year\ncarbon isotope equilibration\n(C13, C14)\n~10 years\n(change in TCO2 required\nto change pCO2 in\nseawater is divided by gas\nflux: e.g. for a 3% increase\nin pCO2, CO2(aq) rises by\n3% and TCO2 rises by 0.3%;\nbut because TCO2 is ~200x\nCO2(aq), it then takes\n200*0.3/3=20x longer\n\n(total dissolved carbon\ndioxide divided by CO2\ngas flux,\n~20 moles/m2/yr)\n\nGlobal Carbon Fluxes\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nThe ocean CO2 \"pumps\"\nafter Tyler Volk\nSolubility Pump\n- CO2 is more soluble in cold water than in warm water\nBiological Pump\n- Organisms take up CO2 in the euphotic zone, sink particles into deeper waters\nSalinity Pump\n- CO2 is more soluble in fresher waters than in saltier waters\n\nThe solubility pump:\nCO2 is more soluble in cold waters than in warm\nwaters. If alkalinity were uniform throughout the ocean\nand if both cold and warm surface waters equilibrated\ntheir pCO2 with the atmosphere, then cold surface waters\nwould have a higher dissolved carbon dioxide content\nthan warm surface waters. As these cold surface waters\ncirculate into the deep interior of the ocean, then deep\nwaters will have more CO2 than warm surface waters.\n\nThe biological pump\nThe biological pump: organisms remove carbon and nutrient elements from the surface ocean (which\nis equilibrated with atmospheric oxygen; note oxygen solubility is a function of temperature); the\ndebris from these organisms sinks and decomposes, releasing carbon and nutrient elements into the\ndeep water and consuming oxygen.\n(Classical) Redfield Ratio:\n(CH2O)106(NH3)16(H3PO4) + 138 O2 -> 106CO2 + 16HNO3 +H3PO4\nThis reaction represents elemental stoichiometries observed in ocean water samples and plankton. It\nconsiders marine organic matter as if it were a mixture of carbohydrates (CH2O), proteins (containing\nNH3), and phospholipids and nucleic acids (H3PO4 bearing). In reality, a broad mixture of\ncompounds occur, and the stoichiometry of O2:C in particular ΔO2/ΔC in deep ocean waters implies a\nhigher value (~165) due to more hydrocarbon-like functional groups:\n(CH2O)111(CH4)11(NH3)16(H3PO4) + 165 O2 = 122 CO2 + 16 HNO3 + 149 H2O + H3PO4\nNote the production of nitric and phosphoric acid in this process; this acid creates changes in\nalkalinity.

The shift must involve the ocean,\nbecause it is the dominant reservoir with which atmosphere communicates on ~20,000 year time scale.\nSalinity change (due to ice buildup) makes a small difference, as does temperature change (if you accept\nthe CLIMAP T estimates); these latter cancel each other out. [note: if you agree instead that tropical\nSST cooled a few degrees, then the effect of temperature is more significant]\n- Consider surface water as deep water which has warmed up, had its P removed by organisms\n(and accompanying removal of 106 CH2O : 21 CaCO3 : 16 NH3 : 1 P)\norganic C\nCaCO3\n↓\n↓\nCO2(surface) = CO2(deep) - (106 + 21) * P(deep)\nCaCO3\nNH3 oxidation\n↓\n↓\nAlk(surface) = Alk(deep) - (2*21 - 16) * P(deep)\nSurface ΣCO2 = 2260 - 2.2 * (106+27) = 1967\nSurface Alk\n= 2375 - 2.2 * (54-16)\n= 2291\n\nBroecker's 2-box interglacial ocean:\n\nBroecker's 2-box glacial ocean:\n(Assumes that marine organic matter from continental shelf is oxidized and put into ocean and that\nsedimentary CaCO3 dissolves to keep [CO3\n=] of deep ocean approximately constant)\n\nBroecker's interglacial/glacial oceans:\nInterglacial\nGlacial\n(Assumes that marine organic matter from\ncontinental shelf is oxidized and put into ocean\nand that sedimentary CaCO3 dissolves to keep\n[CO3\n=] of deep ocean is approximately constant)\n\nEffect of Broecker's scheme on carbon isotopes\n\nComparison to data:\n- At the time, the calculated deep-sea δ13C change was similar to the -0.7 permil\nsuggested by Shackleton (1977) [although we now know that the change is less,\nabout -0.3 to -0.4 %]\n\n- Planktonic (surface) δ13C does not change in model; this result was consistent\nwith evidence available at the time [but data for planktonics had a relatively\nlarge scatter which raised some concerns].\n- Δ13C(P-B) changes before CO2\n- One major problem with this model is that it would deplete the deep-sea of\noxygen.

(1984), Knox and\nMcElroy (1984) preformed phosphorus models for glacial CO2\nThree major deficiencies of the two-box ocean model are that:\n(1) It doesn't take into account high latitude processes (save for a gas-tight \"chiller\"\nthat cools the water as it goes into the deep box). In reality, there is gas\nexchange between the high-latitude water and the atmosphere - leading to more\nCO2 and higher oxygen concentrations in the sinking water.\n(2) It assumes that the sinking surface waters have near-zero nutrients; in actuality\nhigh latitude waters have significant levels of \"pre-formed\" nutrients. About 1/3\nof the phosphorus arriving in the deep sea comes this way rather than from\nsinking particles, hence it did not contribute to the \"biological pump\"\nestimation of PFP = [P] - R[AOU] where AOU is the apparent oxygen utilization and R\nis the P:O2 Redfield Ratio\n\nToggweiler-Sarmiento (1984) 3-box model for interglacial / glacial CO2\nThis model suggests that the pre-formed\nnutrient content of polar surface waters\ndecreases during glacial period (often\npointing to increased high-latitude\nstratification as the mechanism for achieving\nhigher nutrient utilization.\nAn alternative proposal for the mechanism of\nnutrient depletion is the \"Martin Hypothesis\"\nthat says that Fe limits Antarctic productivity\nand that this limitation is diminished during\nglacial periods by a higher dust flux to polar\nregions (see ice core data).\nsee also: Knox and McElroy, Wenk and Siegenthaler\nInterglacial simulation.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nConstruction of ocean chemical box models using\nmatrices: the 3-box model as an example\n- mass (of everything: salt, phosphorus, alkalinity,\ncarbon) is strictly conserved.\n- fluxes of water from box a to box b carry the chemical\nconcentrations of water in box a\n- particles can carry substances downward\n- gases can move up through the ocean surface and back\ndown into another part of the ocean surface.\n\nStep 1: Salinity 1\nAlthough it is of only minor relevance to the carbon system, the salinity distribution provides the\neasiest illustration of the model equations. The processes include mixing between boxes, and a\ntransfer of water from low latitudes to high latitudes through the atmosphere. Underlying this salt\nbalance is the water balance, where water fluxes in and out of each box must balance.\nConsider the steady-state salinity mass balance for the high latitude box 2:\n+Q12 S1 - Q21 S2 - Q23 S2 + Q32 S3 = 0\nwhich can be slightly rewritten to:\n+Q12 S1 + (-Q21 - Q23) S2 + Q32 S3 = 0\nwhich can be expressed as a vector equation:\n+Q12\n(-Q21 - Q23) +Q32\nS1\nS2 = 0\nS3\nF\nQ13\nQ31\nQ12\nQ21\nQ23\nQ32\n\nStep 1: Salinity\nWriting the equations for boxes 1 & 2 and the overall mass balance equation in this form, and\ncollecting them together into a matrix equation: the matrix formula describing this system of\nsimultaneous equations is:\nA\nx =\nb\n-Q12-Q13\n+Q21\n+Q31\nS1\n+Q12\n-Q21-Q23\n+Q32\nS2\n+V1\n+V2\n+V3\nS3\nStot\nThe first two equations describe the mass balances for boxes 1 and 2, and the third equation is\nthe salt mass balance for the system as a whole (an equation for box 3 is not necessary or useful\nsince it is a linear combination of the equations for boxes 1 and 2). Note that the atmosphere is\nassumed to have no salt and as no significant reservoir of water.\n- discussion of units: water fluxes in the ocean are typically expressed as \"Sverdrups\", 106 m3/sec. However,\nconcentrations of chemicals are typically expressed in units of moles/kg. To keep the units consistent, we multiply\nwater fluxes by the density of seawater, 1027 kg/m . This conversion factor is an approximation, because the density of\nseawater depends slightly on temperature, salinity, and pressure, which must be taken into account for very precise\napplications.\n- Also note that the average salinity of the ocean is tied to the mass of the ocean - changes in mean salinity are created\nby withdrawing water from the ocean into massive continental glaciers. Any model which assumes a change in mean\nocean salinity has to include an inversely proportional change in the mass of the ocean, which will impact the\nconcentrations of other dissolved chemicals.\n- Another point to note is that our choice of the water fluxes and system volume as the master variables in \"A\" is a\ncontextual choice; they could have been included as variables. In our case, the fluxes and volumes are chosen as master\nvariables because they apply to all constituents - hence, once \"A\" is set up, it applies to all of the subsystems.\n\nA\nx =\nb\n-Q12-Q13\n+Q21\n+Q31\nP1\nFP1\n+Q12\n-Q21-Q23\n+Q32\nP2\nFP2\n+V1\n+V2\n+V3\nP3\nPtot\nFP1 and FP2 are the fluxes of particulate biogenic phosphorus from boxes 1 and 2 into box 3, where they quantitatively decompose back into\ndissolved form (\"regeneration\"). The mass balance is:\nAdvective Fluxes + Particle Fluxes = 0\n(for each box)\nThe sign of the particle flux in the b matrix for boxes 1 & 2 is positive because it has been moved from the left side of the equation to the\nright; e.g., the P equation for box one is:\n+Q12 P1 - Q21 P2 - Q23 P2 + Q32 P3 - FP1 = 0\nThe particle flux is the negative term (at the end of the left hand side of the equation) switches sign when you move it to the right hand\n(\"zero\") side of the equation:\n+Q12 P1 - Q21 P2 - Q23 P2 + Q32 P3 = FP1\nHow do we derive the biological particle fluxes? Rather than model the biological system explicitly, we simply take observations (or\nhypotheses) of the phosphorus distribution in the ocean to constrain P1, P2, and Ptot. (which sets P3 from the mass balance). The equation is\nused to calculate FP1 and FP2 (Ax=b). Low-latitude surface water P is depleted to low concentrations by efficient biological uptake (in other\nwords, P is the model \"limiting nutrient\"), and high-latitude surface water P is taken as a master variable to be explored. Note that it cannot be\nvaried completely arbitrarily; some values might imply an upward flux of particles! Also, although the ocean phosphorus concentration is not\nmechanistically dependent on salinity, a withdrawal of water from the ocean (resulting in higher salinity) will increase the mean dissolved\nphosphorus concentration.\n\nA\nx =\nb\n-Q12-Q13\n+Q21\n+Q31\nA1\nfA1FP1\n+Q12\n-Q21-Q23\n+Q32\nA2\nFA2FP2\n+V1\n+V2\n+V3\nA3\nAtot\nThe alkalinity model is similar to the phosphorus model, except that the alkalinities are not fixed\nby observation or hypothesis but instead calculated after fixing the \"Redfield\" ratio particulate\nAlk/P ratios for the low- and high-latitude boxes. Note that alkalinity flux is mainly governed by\nthe effect of calcium carbonate precipitaion and dissolution and to a lesser extent by the\noxidation/reduction of protein ammonia from nitrate. Alkalinity is also not transported/stored by\nthe atmosphere!\nAlkalinity is added to the ocean dominantly by the flux of CaCO3 (limestone) dissolved on the\ncontinents and transported by rivers. It is removed from the ocean dominantly by the sedimentation of CaCO3.\nIn considering changes to the carbon system over time, we require that the input of CaCO3 and the output\nbalance (over time scales of 5-10 kyr). In simple models such as this, this balance is often maintained by\nassuming that the deep carbonate ion concentration is constant.\n\nStep 4: carbon dioxide\nA\nx =\nb\n-Q12-Q13\n+Q21\n+Q31\nC1\nfC1FP1+Fca1\n+Q12\n-Q21-Q23\n+Q32\nC2\nfC2FP1 +Fca2\n+V1\n+V2\n+V3\nC3\nCtot-- pCO2 Matm\nThe CO2 model is similar to the alkalinity model, except that CO2 is transported through the atmosphere and the\natmosphere is a significant reservoir. The introduction of the atmosphere as a reservoir would best be handled by adding a\nfourth box (this is how it is implemented in the Excel spreadsheet; it makes the extension to C13 and C14 much easier).\nHowever, to stick to our simple 3-box formulation for this tutorial, we handle this issue simply by removing the carbon dioxide\ncontent of the atmosphere from the total contained in the ocean system (bottom term of b).\nThe particulate carbon flux is affected both by calcium carbonate formation/dissolution and organic matter\nformation/degradation. The fluxes of carbon dioxide between the ocean and atmosphere (Fca1 and Fca2) are shown as both going\ninto the atmosphere for the sake of consistent notation; at steady-state these will be equal to each other in magnitude but of\nopposite signs. Because pCO2 and hence gas exchange fluxes are non-linear functions of Alk and CO2, it is necessary to solve\nthis system by iteration; we guess atmospheric pCO2 and air-sea fluxes, solve the linear system, and then modify the guesses\niteratively until the system converges. Note also that because we are comparing fluxes calculated per unit of volume transfer\n(fluxes between ocean boxes) and fluxes calculated per unit of surface area (gas exchange as a function of the partial pressure\ndifference between the ocean and atmosphere), it is especially important to make the units consistent.\n\nSwitch to 3-box model spreadsheet\n\nProblems with the preformed phosphorus hypothesis\n- Evidence for polar nutrient depletion is mixed; bulk\nsedimentary N isotopes support this idea but foraminiferal\nδ13C and Cd/Ca do not.\n- Although the 3-box model has less of a severe O2 problem\ncompared to the 2-box model, O2 still decreases to very\nlow levels, probably lower than we would expect given\ncontinuous benthic foraminiferal populations.\n- The \"Martin Hypothesis\" Fe alternative may not get\nenough Fe increase to deplete nutrients year-round.\n\nCoral-reef hypothesis\n(Berger and Keir, Opdyke)\n-\nThe basic premise is that when sea level rises, coral reefs will grow upwards\nto reach the new sea-level, and increase pCO2 from the reaction:\n2HCO3\n- + Ca++ = 2CO2 + CaCO3\n(Basically, this reaction removes alkalinity 2x the amount it removes ΣCO2,\nso it increases the Alk/CO2 ratio, the pH rises, and the carbonate equilibria\nshift towards more aqueous CO2.\n-\nIn order to get this effect to be large enough to account for glacial CO2,\neither one of two things must occur:\n- \"Worthington's lid\" cuts off exchange between the surface water and deep water\nfor fifteen thousand years. In 1959, Worthington proposed that the melting of glaciers\nlowered the salinity of surface waters and cut off exchange between the deep sea and the\nsurface. In 2008, we have many proofs that this is not true, including the observation of\nanthropogenic transient tracers in the polar deep waters of both hemispheres, and the\noccurrence of levels of 14C not very different from today.\n- The deep ocean calcium carbonate system becomes incredibly out of whack,\nseverely affecting carbonate sedimentation on the seafloor.\n-\nStrike one, two, three, you're out!\n\nBoyle (1988) nutrient deepening hypothesis\n- In the modern ocean, calcium-carbonate shell-forming\norganisms create CaCO3 several times faster than rivers\ndeliver weathered CO2 to the ocean.\n- This CaCO3 sinks to the seafloor.

Pacific and Arabian Sea - possibly but\nnot necessarily related to ocean nutrient deepening)\n-\nOtherwise works the same as the \"shelf phosphorus\" model.\n\nProblems with the nitrogen fixation / inventory hypothesis\n- Is the Redfield ratio really that flexible (40%)?\nMost marine biologists think not...\n- There are no nitrate paleoproxies - so we can't\nverify the effect with data.\n- How is the balance between N fixation and\ndenitrification re-established?\n\nKeeling and Stephens sea-ice lid\nhypothesis\n- The pCO2 of the atmosphere would be lower if the\npolar regions didn't act as \"leaks\" in the biological\npump.\n- If sea ice nearly completely cut off gas exchange\nbetween the polar regions and the atmosphere,\natmospheric CO2 would be lower.\n- Problem: the extent of complete sea ice coverage\nof the polar ocean would have to be extremely\nhigh.\n\nSummary of the status of the\nglacial/interglacial CO2 problem\n- Step 1: transfer continental carbon into ocean as\ninferred from global mean δ13C. Initially this increases\npCO2 by 45 ppmV. After CaCO3 compensation, this\nwill decrease to ~15 ppmV\n- Step 2: cool sea surface temperatures (2.5°C in polar\nregions, 5°C in lower latitudes (this is probably an\noverstatement). This would decrease pCO2 by 30\nppmV.\n- Step 3: increase ocean salinity by 3% (1.2 % PSS).\nThis increases pCO2 by ~6.5 ppmV.\n- Steps 4 and above: combine all of the plausible models\nin some mixture that avoids the observable problems\nwith any of them individually.\nSee Sigman and Boyle (2000) Nature 407:859-869\n\nReading (1)\nArcher D. ,and Maier-Reimer E.

Recall: Ice core evidence for changes in atmospheric CO2\n\nA. Pre-anthropogenic pCO2 was about 280 ppmV\n\nB. Glacial pCO2 was about 190 ppmV. Five Antarctic ice cores give same number.\nGreenland cores agree tolerably well, but their high dust loading and reaction with CO2\nleads to some problems.\npCO 2\n-500\n-450\n-400\n-350\n-300\nδD, %SMOW\nIce Age est. yrBP\nVostok δD, CO 2 0-420 kyr (Petit et al., 1999)\n\nD\n\nata from Petit et al. (1999)\n\nC. In the early 1980's, it seemed that the Dye 3 Greenland ice core showed relatively\nlarge, rapid (few hundred year) fluctuations in CO2 during glacial stadial/interstadial\nfluctuations. These were not observed in the high resolution Byrd Antarctic ice core,\nand it is now thought that these apparent high CO2 events were artifacts due to melt\nlayers or interactions with dust.\n\nD. So why did atmospheric CO2 change with the glacial/interglacial cycles? Is the CO2\nchange a chicken or an egg in the progression of climate change?\n\n1. Many ideas have been proposed; almost an equal number have been disposed (or is\nit deposed?). Speaking informally, it is as if theories on glacial/interglacial carbon\ndioxide are radioactive with two year half-lives.\n\n2. Despite this situation, there is much to be learned about CO2 in the ocean from those\nideas, so a historical examination of them is still worthwhile.\n\nII. CO2 digression\n\nA. Two useful conservative quantities (properties that mix linearly) are:\n\n1. ΣCO2 = [CO2(aq)] + [HCO3-] + [CO3=]\n\n2. Alkalinity = [HCO3-] + 2[CO3=]\n\n+ [B(OH)4-] + [OH-] - [H+]\n\n+ (etc...)\n\na. \"Alkalinity\" is a device for employing a special form of the charge balance\nequation which divides ions into those that have acid-base reactions and those\nthat don't:\n\ne.g., in a system consisting of a solution of NaCl, MgSO4, NaCO3, and NaHCO3:\n\n[Na+] + 2[Mg++] - 2[SO4=] = [HCO3-] + 2[CO3=] + [OH-]- [H+]\n\n= Alkalinity\n\nb. Adding or removing CO2 from a water sample does not change the alkalinity\n(convince yourself of this!)\n\nC. A common simplification is that of Broecker:\n\n[CO3=] = Alk - ΣCO2\n\nThis approximation is conceptually simple but not accurate because of the neglect of\nsignificant contributions from borate and aqueous CO2 . For example, for values of Alk\nand ΣCO2 typical of pre-anthropogenic warm surface waters (Alk=2275, ΣCO2=1900;\npH=8.3; pCO2=283) and cold deep waters (Alk=2375, ΣCO2=2260; pH=7.9):\n\nunits: (μmol/kg)\n[CO2(aq)] [HCO3-] [CO3=] Alk-ΣCO2 [B(OH)3]\n[B(OH)4-]\n\nws 8 1628 264 375 288 119\ncd 27 2150 85 115 349 58\n\nIn deep waters one can estimate ∆CO3= ≈ 0.6 [Alk-CO2]\n(i.e., about 40% of increased alkalinity converts B(OH)3\nto B(OH)4-)\n\nD. Relevant equilibria (\"apparent\" thermodynamic constants). Because seawater is a \"high ionic\nstrength\" solution (i.e., it is very salty), conventional thermodynamic constants (activity\ncoefficients, etc.) are difficult to define because of strong ionic interactions. But because the\ncomposition of seawater (for major ions) is constant save for variations in total salt content,\nwe can adopt \"apparent constants\" which incorporate the activity coefficients and ion\ninteractions into the \"apparent\" constant (denoted by '):\n\nCO2 (aq)\ni. CO2 (gas) = CO2 (aq) αs' = __________ ≈ 10-1.5\npCO2\n\n[H+][HCO3-]\nii. CO2(aq) + H2O = H+ + HCO3- K1' = ____________ ≈ 10-6.0\n[CO2(aq)]\n\n[H+][CO3=]\niii. HCO3- = H+ + CO3= K2' = __________ ≈ 10-9.1\n[HCO3-]\n\niv. B(OH)3 + H2O = B(OH)4- + H+ [H+] [B(OH)4-]\nKB' = ________________ ≈ 10-8.7\n[B(OH)3]\n\nThese apparent constants are functions of temperature, salinity, and pressure.\n\nE. Once the system of equations relevant to a problem have been set up (and these may include\nmass balance, alkalinity, or other constraints), they are solved generally by computer, where\nthe underlying method involves substituting terms to create a single polynomial equation with\n[H+] as the only variable. This equation is then solved with Newton-Rapson or similar\nmethod. For the range of values appropriate for seawater, simplifications can be made that\nreduce this system of equations to a cubic polynomial with an exact solution.D. By\n\nexpressing all species in terms of [H+], then combining into a single equation in [H+]), it can\nbe shown that\n\npH = f ( Alk\nΣCO2\n,(T,S,P))\n\nAssuming deviations within the range of values likely to be found in the ocean, the\nrelationship can be expressed as a simple cubic equation which has an exact solution. Since\nthe relative amount of the various CO2 species is a function of the pH, we can compute the\nabsolute amount of each species as f(pH)*ΣCO2; or directly as f(Alk, ΣCO2). The best\nformulation for CO2 system calculations under natural conditions is to solve the cubic\nequation for the hydrogen ion where Alk, ΣCO2, and borate are taken into account:\n\n1. Let A = Alk/ΣCO2 and B = ΣB/ΣCO2, let [H+] = the activity of hydrogen ion, and\nlet K1', K2', and KB' be the apparent constants in seawater at the appropriate\ntemperature, pressure, and salinity; then:\n\n2. 0 = [H+]3 A\n\n+ [H+]2 [K1'(A-1) + KB'(A-B)]\n\n+ [H+] [K1'KB'(A-B-1) + K1'K2'(A-2)]\n\n+ [K1'K2'KB'(A-B-2)]\n\nE. A quick approximate solution to the carbonate system can be obtained by combining\nthe equations for K2' and KB':\n\n[B(OH)4-] / [CO3=] = (KB'/K2') ([B(OH)3]/[HCO3-]\n\nand noting that the ratio [B(OH3)/[HCO3]- - 1/6 does not vary much throughout\nthe ocean, (and (KB'/K2') - 3), so:\n\n[B(OH)4-] - [CO3=] / 2\n\nand hence (noting that CO2(aq) is small and so are its variations (17±10):\n\nCO3= - (Alk - ΣCO2 + 17) / 1.5 (17 is the approximate aqueous CO2)\n\nHCO3- - ΣCO2 - CO3= - 17 \"\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\n[H+] - K2' [HCO3-] / [CO3=]\n\n[CO2(aq)] - [H+] [HCO3-] / K1'\n\npCO2 - [CO2(aq)] / αs'\n\nF. Carbon Isotope Fractionation: equilibrium carbon isotope fractionation between CO2\nsystem species is a function of temperature. Kinetic lags are important.\n\nδ13C and gas exchange\n\nA.

Piston Velocity concept. If we look at the dimensions of the above equation, it has\ndimensions of distance per time. One can think of this process as if imaginary\npistons were moving through the water column and simultaneously pushing gas in\nand out of the ocean. This \"piston\" has a velocity magnitude of about 2000 m/yr!\n\n2. For gases like oxygen and nitrogen, which equilibrate entirely between the gas\nphase and the dissolved aqueous form, gas exchange is very effective and surface\nwaters are almost at equilibrium. For carbon dioxide however, where the dissolved\naqueous gas equilibrates with the bicarbonate and carbonate ions which occur at\nmuch higher concentrations, gas exchange takes much longer and surface waters\nare usually out of equilibrium with the atmosphere - sometimes by up to a factor of\ntwo.\n\n3. Rate of exchange of CO2 between ocean and atmosphere. Speaking in round terms,\nwe can calculate the average rate at which CO2 moves across the sea surface:\n\n2000 m/yr * 10-5 moles/kg * 1000 kg/m3 = 20 moles/m2/yr\n\npiston vel. aq. CO2 conc. conversion factor\n\nGiven that the upper 75 m of the water column (mixed layer) underneath a square\nmeter contains 150 moles of carbon, full equilibration for carbon isotopes (e.g. 13C,\n14C) can take some time (years). pCO2 equilibration takes less time however,\nbecause the pH shift induced by gas exchange shifts the water towards equilibrium\n(e.g., if water is supersaturated with respect to atmosphere, CO2 is lost and pH of\nseawater rises and some aqueous CO2 is lost to the bicarbonate pool. Hence pCO2\nis moved towards equilibrium both by loss of aqueous CO2 to atmosphere and by\nloss of aqueous CO2 to bicarbonate pool (this is related to the Revelle Factor).\n\n4. One square meter of the the upper 100m of the ocean (105kg) contains 200 moles of\ncarbon. 0.5% of this carbon is as dissolved CO2, and the Revelle Factor is ~10, so\nabout 200*0.005*10 = 10 moles of CO2 needs to be transferred to equilibrate the\nmixed layer with the atmosphere. Since the gas exchange rate is 20 moles/m2/yr,\nthe mixed layer of the ocean can equilibrate with the atmosphere on a time scale of\nabout a half-year (note however that 13C and 14C will take longer to equilibrate\nbecause the total carbon dioxide must exchange to fully equilibrate the isotopes,\ni.e., 200/20 = 10 years). Hence the \"average\" anthropogenic CO2 molecule has\nplenty of time to equilibrate with the mixed-layer.\n\nSimple Gas Exchange\n(e.g. O2, Ar)\n~2 weeks\n(depth of mixed\nlayer divided by\npiston velocity\n- i.e. total gas\ncontent divided\nby gas flux)\npCO2 equilibration\n~1 year\ncarbon isotope equilibration\n(C13, C14)\n~10 years\n(change in TCO2 required\nto change pCO2 in\nseawater is divided by gas\nflux: e.g. for a 3% increase\nin pCO2, CO2(aq) rises by\n3% and TCO2 rises by 0.3%;\nbut because TCO2 is ~200x\nCO2(aq), it then takes\n200*0.3/3=20x longer\n\n(total dissolved carbon\ndioxide divided by CO2\ngas flux,\n~20 moles/m2/yr)\n\nKinetic-isotope disequilibrium (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1995): Imagine a mixed layer system\nwhich is in equilibrium for carbon isotope ratio, but below equilibrium for pCO2. Gas\nexchange will drive the mixed layer into equilibrium in one year's time; but in doing so, it\nwill shift the mixed layer towards the lighter isotope (because it is the light CO2(aq)\nspecies which is involved in gas exchange). After about 10 years, the system comes back\ninto isotopic equilibrium.\n\npCO2\ntime-->\none year\nten years\nd13C\nH. CO2 and the oceans\n\nDepth, m\n5 10 15 20 25 30\nTemperature , °C\n\n1.. The solubility pump: CO2 is more soluble in cold waters than in warm waters. If\nalkalinity were uniform throughout the ocean and if both cold and warm surface\nwaters equilibrated their pCO2 with the atmosphere, then cold surface waters would\nhave a higher dissolved carbon dioxide content than warm surface waters. As these\ncold surface waters circulate into the deep interior of the ocean, then deep waters\nwill have more CO2 than warm surface waters.\n\n2. The biological pump: organisms remove carbon and nutrient elements from the\nsurface ocean (which is equilibrated with atmospheric oxygen; note oxygen\nsolubility is a function of temperature); the debris from these organisms sinks\nand decomposes, releasing carbon and nutrient elements into the deep water and\nconsuming oxygen.\n\n(Classical) Redfield Ratio:\n\n(CH2O)106(NH3)16(H3PO4) + 138 O2 -> 106CO2 + 16HNO3 +H3PO4\n\nThis reaction represents elemental stoichiometries observed in ocean water\nsamples and plankton. It considers marine organic matter as if it were a mixture\nof carbohydrates (CH2O), proteins (containing NH3), and phospholipids and\n\nnucleic acids (H3PO4 bearing). In reality, a broad mixture of compounds occur,\nand the stoichiometry of O2:C in particular ∆O2/∆C in deep ocean waters\nimplies a higher value (~165, because of more hydrocarbon-like functional\ngroups):\n\n(CH2O)111(CH4)11(NH3)16(H3PO4) + 165 O2 = 122 CO2 + 16 HNO3 + 149 H2O + H3PO4\n\nNote the production of nitric and phosphoric acid in this process; this acid\ncreates changes in alkalinity. Once you acknowledge this process, you also need\nto take into account another effect that reduces the acid effect on alkalinity by\nabout 1/3: the presence of ion-exchanged carboxyl groups:\n\n(CH2O)102(CH4)14(HCOO-Na+)6(NH3)16(H3PO4) + 165 O2\n= 122 CO2 + 16 HNO3 + 146 H2O + H3PO4 + 6 NaOH\n\nThere is intense debate on whether the C:P and N:P stoichiometries are\nfundamental to marine ecosystems, or whether there is some plasticity (e.g.,\ncould N:P = 25?). (There is less debate on variable C:N ratios than for C:P).\n\nWe should also note that some organisms precipitate inorganic shells out of\ncalcium carbonate (CaCO3) and silica (SiO2.nH2O). For example for every 106\norganic carbon atoms converted to organic matter, about 22 CaCO3 molecules\nare precipitated (ocean-wide average).\n\nDepth, m\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\nPO4, μmol/kg\n\n3.

Must involve the ocean,\nbecause it is dominant reservoir with which atmosphere communicates on ~20,000\nyear time scale. Salinity change (due to ice buildup) makes small difference, as does\ntemperature change (if you accept the CLIMAP T estimates); these latter cancel each\nother out.\n\nB.

Comparison to data\n\n1. At the time, the calculated deep-sea δ13C change was similar to the -0.7 permil\nsuggested by Shackleton (1977) [although we now know that the change is less,\nabout -0.3 to -0.4 %]\n--\n2. Planktonic (surface) δ13C does not change in model; this result was consistent with\nevidence available at the time [but data for planktonics had a relatively large scatter\nwhich raises some concerns].\n\n3. One major problem with this model is that it would deplete the deep-sea of oxygen.\nThis outcome clearly did not happen (as proven by the existence of glacial-age\nbenthic foraminifera, which are aerobic organisms).\n\nIII.

Appears to confirm reduced CO2 during glacials;\nhowever, it appears that CO2 change occurs before that of sea level (as indicated by\nδ18O)\n\nIV. Cd evidence:\n\nA. It does not appear that deep ocean Cd did not increase (Boyle and Keigwin, 1985/6;\nBoyle, 1992); Broecker theory requires +40% increase in P.\n\nB. Paired Cd-δ13C evidence suggests that much of the global δ13C change is due to P-free\ncarbon (trees and soils).\n\nV. Pre-formed phosphate scenario (Toggweiler and Sarmiento, 1984,1985; Wenk and\nSiegenthaler, 1984,1985; Ennever and McElroy, 1984,1985)\n\nA. One unrealistic feature of the two-box ocean is that not all of the phosphorus is\nremoved before water that upwells at high latitudes is cooled and returned to the deep\nsea as bottom. About 1/3 of all deep ocean phosphorus arrives advectively rather than\nby particulate transfer. In effect, this makes the deep ocean \"leaky\" with respect to\nCO2, so that atmospheric CO2 levels are higher than they would be in the absence of\nthis \"leak\". Factors that change the \"leakiness\" of the deep ocean carbon dioxide can\nchange atmospheric CO2\n\nB. Another unrealistic feature of the two-box ocean is that warm surface waters do not fill\nup most of the deep ocean; instead, cold surface waters at high latitudes sink to fill up\nmost of the ocean. This aspect brings more oxygen into the deep sea.\n\nC. So it is more realistic to have the deep ocean in communication with a cold surface\nocean which contains residual phosphorus.\n\nD. Consider a three-box ocean with a cold polar outcrop\n\nQ13\nQ31\nQ12\nQ21\nQ23\nQ32\nwarm surface\nP=0\ncold\npolar\nP=1.4\ndeep\nP=2.2\nAtmosphere\n\n1. Definition of pre-formed phosphate: PFP = P - r AOU(T)\n\nwhere r = ∆O2:∆P \"Redfield ratio\"\nand AOU = Apparent oxygen utilization (equil. sol. - observed O2)\n\n2. Calculation of magnitude of CO2 changes for a given PFP change.\n\n3. Ways to change pre-formed phosphate:\n\na. Change relative exchange rates of warm surface and deep ocean with cold polar.\n\nb. More biological productivity in cold polar surface waters (?why? Martin iron\nhypothesis).\n\nc. Change nutrient content of thermocline and hence upwell water of different\nnutrient content at high latitudes.\n\nD. Advantages/Disadvantages of this theory:\n\n1. Advantage: can produce rapid CO2 changes\n2. Advantage: consistent with benthic-planktonic δ13C evidence\n3. Disadvantage: doesn't solve oxygen problem\n4. Disadvantage: there is no evidence that PFP changes! (high latitude planktonic Cd\ndoes not change, and planktonic δ13C actually gets more negative)\n\nE. Multi-box steady-state ocean modeling using linear matrix methods: Ocean Box\nModeling.\n\nVI. Coral Reef hypotheses\n\nA. Basic premise is that CaCO3 precipitation leads to release of CO2: Ca++ + 2HCO3- =\nCO2 + CaCO3 , and that a rise in sea-level will increase the growth opportunities for\ncorals.\n\nB. Keir-Berger w/\"Worthington's Lid\": this effect is enhanced by formation of a meltwater\nlid that keeps much of the released CO2 in the mixed layer/atmosphere (hence coral\ngrowth rates don't have to be especially high). Snag: no evidence that deep ocean\nventilation rates were cut off during deglaciation (recall: benthic-planktonic 14C\ndifference).\n\nC. Opdyke version (Holocene coral growth rates greater than input from weathering).\nCoral growth rates are not likely to be this high, and the continuation of this\nphenomenom for 10,000 years would drive the deep ocean into a state of intense\ncarbonate undersaturation.\n\nVII. Nutrient deepening/alkalinity response model (Boyle, 1988).\n\nA. Recall that one of the results of the paleo-deep water studies is that glacial P and δ13C\ndistributions change to move nutrients from the upper ocean into the deepest parts of\nthe ocean. Since CO2 is a weak acid, this movement of CO2 into the deep ocean will\nmake the deep ocean more corrosive to CaCO3 (i.e., deep [CO3=] will go down).\n\nB. As Broecker (1982) pointed out, if weathering input and deep-sea biological carbonate\nproduction remains constant, then in order to maintain the CCD/lysocline at the same\nposition, the deep [CO3=] must remain approximately constant. If there is more CO2 in\ndeep waters, then to keep [CO3=] constant, then the alkalinity will have to rise. This is\nachieved by dissolving some of the CaCO3 on the seafloor: CO2 + CaCO3 = Ca++ +\n2HCO3-. Note that this reaction increases the alkalinity of the whole ocean by two\nμeq/kg for every μmol/kg of CO2 added from dissolution. Hence the ratio of\nAlk/ΣCO2 in the whole ocean increases, pH rises, and pCO2 drops.\n\nC. A complication of this model is that CO2 may not be transferred vertically\nindependently of alkalinity; in some scenarios, the [CO3=] response is small (e.g.\nversions that increase vertical mixing between the surface and intermediate depth\n\nocean) while in others it is much larger (e.g., an increase in the fraction of organic\nmatter that decomposes in the deep ocean as opposed to the intermediate depth ocean).\n\nD. The state of this idea: (1) it doesn't appear that the whole ocean nutrient-deepening is\nquantitatively large enough to account for more than a fraction of pCO2 drop, even give\ngiven the most sensitive scenario (Boyle, 1992), and (2) the [CO3=] = constant\nconstraint may not be the best way to simulate the lysocline/CCD response; using a\nmore explicit model of carbonate dissolution on the seafloor reduces the effectiveness\nof this mechanism at changing pCO2 (Emerson and Archer, 1993).\n\nVIII. Rain Ratio Model\n\nA. Exists in various incarnations. What the ideas have in common is noting that there is a\n\"rain ratio\" of CH2O:CaCO3, and that this ratio may have changed between glacial and\ninterglacial times (e.g. Keir and Berger, 1985).\n\nB. Early versions of this idea sprang from the idea that \"diatoms are more efficient at\nreducing surface water pCO2 than coccolithophorids\". At face value, this notion seems\nsubtly obvious: diatoms remove only CO2 (as CH2O) while coccolithophorids remove\nboth CO2 and CaCO3. But because coccolithophorids remove two units of alkalinity\nfor every CaCO3 removed, they lower the pH and hence create a higher pCO2 for a\ngiven ΣCO2 level. However, as we saw earlier, reducing the low-latitude CaCO3:\nCH2O rain ratio by a factor of two in the Toggweiler-Sarmiento 3-box ocean model\nhad a significant response (280->271 ppmV), but not enough to account for glacial\npCO2 lowering. Even lowering the ratio by a factor of 4 in that model - placing the rain\nrate precariously close to the point at which carbonate isn't being deposited as fast as it\nis being weathered - only gives an additional 12 ppmV. The reason for this lack of\nresponse is that a mass-conserving ocean will often take CO2 that is removed in one\npart of the ocean pop back up in another part of the ocean, cancelling the apparent\neffectiveness of the original change. In this case, the upwelling of deep water to the\nhigh latitude ocean counters the direct effect of the low-latitude rain ratio change. Let\nthis serve as a warning about purely qualitative ideas about mechanisms controlling\npCO2.\n\nC. In a more subtle variation on this theme, it is noted that currently about 5 times more\ncalcium carbonate is being formed by organisms than is coming in from rivers, hence\n80% of the biogenic flux is dissolved. If the rain ratio is reduced by a factor of 50%\n(biogenic = 2.5xinput, only 60% of the biogenic flux needs to be dissolved. Hence the\n[CO3=] concentration of the deep ocean can be higher, leading to higher oceanic\nalkalinity and hence lower pCO2.\n\nD. Archer/Maier-Reimer O-GCM w/CO2 chemistry:\n\n1.Model is an ocean GCM including carbon cycle chemistry and a CaCO3 dissolution\nmodel for the seafloor, holding ocean circulation constant. Key characteristic of\ndissolution model is a major role for in-situ organic carbon degradation in CaCO3\ndissolution. In the model, the CH2O:CaCO3 rain ratio is varied slightly, and it is\n\nfound that the degree of in-situ dissolution increases greatly - so much so, that most\nof the deep ocean is supersaturated with respect to CaCO3! Hence, the balance\nbetween input and output of CaCO3 is mediated by a balance between the extent of\nsupersaturation and the extent of in-situ organic carbon degradation (higher\nsupersaturation leads to lower CaCO3 dissolution, higher in-situ organic\ndegradation leads to more CaCO3 dissolution; for a given organic degradation the\ndeep ocean supersaturation moves to the point where dissolution is sufficient to\ncompensate for excess of production over input. Notable in model is the relatively\nsmall change in rain ratio necessary to create large pCO2 changes.\n\nArcher and Maier-Reimer \"rain ratio\" sedimentary dissolution hypothesis.\n\n2. Model predicts large pH increase in deep ocean. This may be verifiable by boron\nisotope paleo-pH method.\n\n3. One caution: the published version of this paper relies on a version of the calcium\ncarbonate dissolution kinetics that assumes that the dissolution rate varies as the 4th\npower of the undersaturation. More recent evidence discussed by Hales (----)\n\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare. Adapted from source: Broecker (Glacial World According to Wally) concept from Archer and Maier-Reimer.\n\nsuggests that this formulation is in error and that dissolution rate is linear with\nundersaturation. It would be interesting to know how sensitive this model is to\nchanging this assumption.\n\n4. One major flaw of this model is that it predicts that essentially the whole ocean floor\n(including the deep Pacific) should be covered by calcium carbonate during glacial\ntimes. This is not observed.\n\nIX. R. Keeling \"sea ice/gas exchange mechanism: proposes that LGM sea ice cover over the\nAntarctic prevented the CO2 \"leak\" in the Southern Ocean. Problem: sea ice cover must\nbe extremely efficient (>95%) for this mechanism to work.\n\nX. Nitrate as a limiting nutrient: the idea and its development\n\nA. McElroy et al. proposed that instead of changes in oceanic phosphorus, nitrate changes\ncould control glacial/interglacial CO2 cycles. The reason for an increase in nitrogen in\nthe glacial ocean would be a decrease in denitrification (perhaps due to lower sea-level,\nalthough other causes may also produce this effect). Because nitrate has a residence\ntime of about 104 years (compared to 105 years for P), it is easier to change the oceanic\nN value on G/I timescales.\n\nB. This idea was initially discounted on two grounds:\n\n1. Redfield argued that P, not N, is the limiting nutrient in seawater because it is only\nsupplied and lost through geological interactions (dissolution from rocks, loss to\nsedimentation). Nitrogen, on the other hand, is dominantly fixed biologically\n(nitrogen fixers), and if the supply of N is not sufficient, the ecological balance\nwould be shifted towards nitrogen fixers, and the nitrate supply would \"catch up\"\nwith the available phosphorus.\n\n2. Altabet and Curry showed that it did not appear that the isotopic composition of\noceanic nitrogen changed on G/I timescales. This was taken as evidence against a\nlarge decrease in denitrification during glacial times, because water column\ndenitrification is accompanied by a large isotopic fractionation. However, recent\nstudies by Brandes and Devol (1997) indicate that continental shelf sedimentary\ndenitrification does not produce an isotope shift.\n\nC. This idea has been recently revived (in somewhat modified form) given the following\narguments:\n\n1. Falkowski has argued that the Redfield argument is wrong because it does not take\ninto account another limiting nutrient: iron. Redfield derived his arguments from\nterrestrial studies (Hutchinson), where Fe is not limiting. However, in the ocean in\nmany environments, iron is limiting - in some cases to all marine life, and perhaps\nalmost everywhere with respect to nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation is an iron-\nintensive biochemical process. Hence nitrate, not phosphate might be the limiting\nnutrient.\n\n2. It is not clear that a reduction in denitrification will necessarily be reflected in a\nchange in the isotopic composition of oceanic nitrate. Studies by Devol and Brandes\nshow that continental margin sediments - where nitrate is completely depleted at\n\nsome depth in the sediment due to denitrification - do not evidence any isotopic\nfractionation in nitrate because the nitrate is completely consumed within the\nsediments. Although a very small isotope fractionation may remain - due to the\ndifference in the diffusion of 15NO3\n- (63 amu) compared to 14NO3\n- - (62 amu) - the\nlarge isotope fractionation due to denitrication has little effect.\n\nD. Studies of the nitrogen isotope composition of continental margin sediments off of\nMexico (Ganeshram et al., 1995) and in the Arabian Sea (Altabet et al., 1995) show\nlighter nitrogen; this is interpreted as implying less efficient glacial water column\ndenitrification in these environments.\n\nE. Denitrication today appears to occur roughly equally on continental shelves and in the\nlow-oxygen zones of the Eastern Tropical Pacifical Pacific. If both of these sinks was\ndiminished, and the supply of fixed nitrogen enhanced by the greater iron supply in the\ndusty glacial atmosphere, then the nitrate content of the ocean may well have been\nhigher. The fly in this ointment: how will we ever establish that this happened (paleo-\nnitrate indicators being in limited supply).\n\nF. Studies of the nitrogen isotopic composition of Antarctic sediments and diatoms\n(suggesting somewhat more efficient nitrate utilization) have also revived the polar\nnutrient hypothesis to some extent.\n\nXI. Toggweiler \"change in mode of Southern Ocean deepwater formation\" model (personal\ncommunication, 2002). Premise is that in the ocean today, AABW formation occurs on the\ncontinental shelf after nearly complete equilibration of the surface water with atmosphere\n(hence CO2 is \"lost\" from ocean to atmosphere). He proposes that during the last glacial\nmaximum, deepwater formation proceeded by deep ocean convection (short-lived uniform\ncolumn of high density water from surface to bottom) where gas exchange equilibration\ncannot occur - hence sealing off the ocean CO2 \"leak\" and reducing atmospheric CO2.\n\nXII. Oceanic Si reorganization (Brzezinski et al. 2002): Argue that higher glacial Southern\nOcean iron leads to lower (1:1 compared to 4:1 today) Si(OH)4:N ratios in glacial\nAntarctic phytoplankton (because diatoms make thinner shells when they are iron-replete:\nHutchins and Bruland, 1998). This leads to more Si(OH)4 in sinking Antarctic water\nmasses and hence more Si in the low latitude ocean: hence leading to more diatoms\nrelative to coccolithophores in the low latitude ocean, weakening the carbonate pump and\nincreasing the depth of organic matter remineralization (diatoms sink faster than other\nforms of organic matter). Taken all together, these factors are estimated to lower CO2 by\nas much as 60 ppm.\n\nReadings and References\n\nArcher D. ,and Maier-Reimer E.

The rest of the time the temperature\nvariations have been more subtle; i.e., the deep ocean must generally have been about 2°C\ncolder than it is at present. This is known because the uplifted coral terraces suggest that sea\nlevel change between stages (5a,5c) and 5e was only 10-20m, but benthic δ18O would have a\nsea-level change equivalent to more than 40m. So even though the sea level was not very\nmuch different during stages 5a,b and 5e, the deep sea temperature was about 2°colder.\n- Recently Chappell et al. (1996) have shown that the original New Guinea sea level estimates\nwere flawed by errors in 230Th/U ages (between 30-70 ka) and elevation estimations (all previous\ndates were too young, so uplift was underestimated). Note that the \"sea level from δ18O\" curve is\nbased on taking the \"smoothed\" difference between the planktonic RC17-177 record\n(Shackleton) and the benthic V19-30 record, and determining the difference; i.e., this δ18O\nbased sea level record assumes that there is no temperature (or local salinity) temporal signal\nin core RC17-177.\n\nBenthic δ18O vs New Guinea sea\nlevel\nChappell and Shackleton,\n(1986) Nature\n\nRevised New Guinea sea level estimates compared to (modified) δ18O\nChappel et al.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to know that\ntemperature did not change somewhere. One constraint occurs in places\nwhere the potential temperature is near the freezing point of seawater. It can't\nget any colder (although it might have become warmer). It has been argued\non various grounds (Labeyrie et al., 1987) that except for the most severe\nglaciations, NADW formation occurs in the Norwegian/Greenland Sea. In\nthat case, the water must have been near the freezing point (as it is today), so\nthat the temperature must have remained constant. A somewhat poetic \"stack\"\nof several N/G sea records was reconstructed (and incorporated with the\noxygen isotope and sea level constraints for the last glacial maximum) to\nobtain a continuous estimate for the mean oxygen isotope composition of\nseawater. (the poetry involves how the cores were stacked, as the usual 5a-5b-\n5c-5d-5e sequence was not clearly evident in most of the records).\n\nGallup Termination II dates\n\nSea level, isostasy, and the viscoelastic earth\nEustatic vs. Relative Sea level changes\nRelative sea level is what you measure: the position where the sea meets the\nland (relative to some benchmark). Relative sea level includes a component of the\nvertical movements of the land.\nEustatic sea level is the level of the ocean corrected for the vertical\nmovements of the land - and generally assumed to be the same everywhere on earth\n(except for some corrections - see later).\nIsostasy: As major ice sheets build up on the earth's surface, the solid earth below sinks\nto maintain isostatic equilibrium: in effect, the (continental block + ice sheet) is floating\nin the mantle:\nIce\nρ1\ncontinent\nρ2\nMantle\nρ3\nIsostatic equilibrium is: ρ1z1+ ρ2z2 = ρ3z3\n\nSea level, isostasy, and the viscoelastic\nearth 2\nOne caution: plates can tilt or flex\nAnother factor: the earth's mantle acts like a very viscous fluid. Imagine\nputting an ice cube on a boat floating in molasses: it takes a while (many\nthousands of years for the earth) for the system to reach its equilibrium level.\nAfter large ice sheets melt, the earth slowly rises, creating a series of terraces\nalong the coastline:\nBy dating deposits on\nthe terraces, we can\nconstruct a relative sea\nlevel curve (that is\ndominated by local\nuplift).\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nUplift since 6000 ka\nThis evidence indicates\nthat the (late stage)\nLaurentide ice sheet had\ntwo domes\nsource: R.F.

Putting the ice sheets on Europe and North\nAmerica of course causes the underlying continent to sink significantly (e.g. ice sheets were\nabout 5 km maximum thickness; density of ice ~1 and mantle ~3, so continent must sink\nabout 5/3 km) and to flex near the margins. The displaced mantle then flows elsewhere,\ncausing other places to move up. This all takes place on a finite time scale by laws of fluid\ndynamics, and depends heavily on the viscosity (structure) of the mantle (in fact, the only\nway we know the viscosity of the mantle is from studies of the rates of crustal rebound).\nAll of this is reversed as the ice melts. Most of the isostatic adjustment occurs within a few\nthousand years, but there are parts of Hudson's bay that are still rebounding at rate of\n1 m/century.\nAn interesting sidelight of this process is that estimates for how fast modern sea\nlevel is rising must take into account this crustal rebound and the associated\nmantle flows.\nThe ongoing rebound can be estimated from precise surveys; ancient rebound can\nbe estimated by (14C) dating shells of organisms that grow in the shallow seashore.\n\nThe sea-level change expected for a \"static\" ocean island depends\non where the island is relative to the ice sheets and continents\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nsource:Clark et al.

It is hard to find\ncontinuous accumulation sequences; in particular,\nnear and under the northern ice sheets, the climate\nrecord is self-erasing. Also, the paleo-ecology is\nmore problematical; does land vegetation respond\nsimply to temperature and rainfall (or both or\nextremes of both)? There are fewer good\ngeochemical indicators as well. The most successful\ntechniques have involved lake sediments and peat bog\nsections. A few new methods have emerged in the\nrecent years..\n\nStudies of moraines, eskers, striations, etc.\nUsed to infer ice sheet presence, extent (from maximum through\ndeglaciation), flow directions.\nNote 700-1000 m depression of snow line (Hawaii, New Guinea,\nColumbia, and East Africa; Andean and Himalayan ice caps,\nothers).

(1992) analyzed calcite deposited in a\nnarrow groundwater vein in Nevada for δ18O and Th/U age. They reported that\nthe deposit grew from ~566 to ~60 kyrBP, and that the δ18O of this record\nindicated less depleted values at 140 kyrBP. They suggested that this record\ncontradicted the SPECMAP chronology.\n1. Many people questioned the reliability of their chronology (e.g., how could\nthey be sure that the initial 230Th was negligible when the youngest sample had\nsignificant 230Th?). More recently, Edwards et al. (1997) used 231Pa/235U dating to\ncheck the ages of two Devil's Hole samples and found that the age was\nconcordant with the 230Th age - making it likely that the chronology is accurate.\nOn the other hand, the meaning of the δ18O record (knowing that groundwater can\noften be 20-40 kyr old) is not entirely straightforward. But recently Herbert et al.\n(2002) have used alkenone temperature estimates to show that there appears to be\na significant phase offset for the temperatures of the southwestern US relative to\nthe marine δ18O record, with warming occurring well before deglaciation. This\nevidence suggests that the two records are showing a regional response to climate\nchange that differs from the global mean.\n\nDevil's Hole vein calcite controversy 2\nWinograd et al.

Introduction: In general, paleoclimatology is tougher on the continents than in the ocean. It is\nhard to find continuous accumulation sequences; in particular, near and under the northern\nice sheets, the climate record is self-erasing. Also, the paleo-ecology is more problematical;\ndoes land vegetation respond simply to temperature and rainfall (or both or extremes of\nboth)? There are fewer good geochemical indicators as well. The most successful techniques\nhave involved lakes sediments and peat bog sections. A few new methods have emerged in\nhe past few years, however.\nt\nII. Studies of moraines, striations, eskers, etc. (sometimes 14C dated) to infer ice sheet\novements, coverage at maxima and subsequent retreat pattern.\nm\n700-1000 m snowline depression in Hawaii, New Guinea, Columbia, and East Africa;\nAndean and Himalayan ice caps. Models suggest that this would require a 4°C\ndecline in tropical air temperatures during peak glacial times.\n\nIII. For the last 8,000 years, tree rings can help infer climate, either from width variations and\nO,C,H isotopes in the cellulose; 14C variations also provide useful information. However,\nthere are significant methodological questions about the meaning of stable isotopes in tree\nrings (are they affected by age of tree? do they record surface water or ground water? What\ns the effect of evapotranspiration on D and O in trees?...)\ni\nIV. Some other bizarre paleoclimate indicators: packrat middens (e.g. what type of seeds were\navailable? What is the δ13C of those seeds? Not to mention the δ13C of packrat urine...,\neetle remains, ....)\nb\nV.

Lake carbonates, speleothems and vein calcites\n\nA. Speleothems (stalactites and stalagmites) are carbonate deposits produced when\ngroundwater drips from the roofs of caves and release CO2 - thereby supersaturating in\ncalcium carbonate and precipitating successive solid layers. Because groundwater is high\nin U, these deposits can be dated by U/Th methods (although one has to be careful about\ninitial 230Th). Carbon and oxygen isotope measurements are straightforward, although\nδ18O is influenced by changes in both T and groundwater δ18O.\n\nImages removed due to copyright considerations.\nSource: Wang et al. (2001), figure 1 and 2.\n\nB. Some hard water lakes precipitate CaCO3 that accumulates in sediments. Isotopic\ncomposition is a function of changes in the water (mean temperature of precipitation) and\nlocal temperature.\n\nC. Devil's Hole vein calcite controversy. Winograd et al. (1985) and Ludwig et al. (1992)\nanalyzed calcite deposited in a narrow groundwater vein in Nevada for δ18O and Th/U\nage. They reported that the deposit grew from ~566 to ~60 kyrBP, and that the δ18O of\nthis record indicated less depleted values at 140 kyrBP. They suggested that this record\ncontradicted the SPECMAP chronology.\n\n1. Several people questioned the reliability of their chronology (e.g., how could they be\nsure that the initial 230Th was negligible when the youngest sample had significant\n230Th?). More recently, Edwards et al. (1997) used 231Pa/235U dating to check the\nages of two Devil's Hole samples and found that the age was concordant with the\n230Th age - making it likely that the chronology is accurate. On the other hand, the\nmeaning of the δ18O record (knowing that groundwater can often be 20-40 kyr old) is\nnot entirely straightforward. But recently Herbert et al. (2002) have used alkenone\ntemperature estimates to show that there appears to be a significant phase offset for\nthe temperatures of the southwestern US relative to the marine δ18O record, with\nwarming occurring well before deglaciation. This evidence suggests that the two\nrecords are showing a regional response to climate change that differs from the global\nmean.\n\nIX. Continental chronology is a problem once we are past the useful 14C time span. Other\ndating techniques: thermoluminescence; speleothems can be 230Th dated (although the\nssumption that initial 230Th is zero is at least somewhat questionable)\na\nX. Low-latitude mountain glaciers\n\nA .\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\nSource: Herbert et al. (2002).\n\nB. Some low-latitude mountain glaciers are suitable for ice coring: e.g., Guliya Ice Core,\nTibet\n\nFigure 3 in Thompson L. G., T. Yao, M. E. Davis, K. A. Henderson, Thompson E. Mosely, P.-N.Lin, J. Beer,\nH.-A. Synal, Dai J. Cole, and J. F. Bolzan. \"Tropical climate instability: the last glacial cycle from a\nQuinhai-Tibetan ice core.\" Science 276 (1997): 1821-1825.\n\nXI. Noble gas solubilities in relic groundwaters\n\nA. Basic idea is exquisitely simple: the different noble gases have different temperature\ndependence for their aqueous solubilities:\n\nIf we have data on the equilibrium content of any two noble gases, the temperature is\ndefined. Having multiple noble gases, the system is over-determined.\n\nB. Complications: (1) 4He is added from radioactive decay - and this addition can't be\ninferred from first principles; (2) in addition to equilibrium solubility, some atmospheric\nbubbles are trapped and dissolved at higher pressures. The gas content of this component\nreflects the inter-gas ratio of the atmosphere, not the solubility. This problem is\nsignificant, but it can be corrected for given data on several noble gases: e.g., by finding\nout which mixture of solubility equilibrium and air dissolution matches the data the best\nfor Ne-Xe. The residual anomaly for He is taken as a measure of the radioactive decay\ncontribution. Noble gas groundwater paleotemperatures.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n.\nAdapted from source: M.

(1992).\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\nSource: Stute, 1989.\n\nD. Dispersion will cause some smoothing of the climate signal in the aquifer - can't expect to\nsee short events.\n\nE. Some results:\n1. Great Hungarian Plain\n2. Texas\n3. New Mexico\n4. Brazil coastal site - also 5 degC (involves double correction -air plus heavy)\n5. South Africa - 5.5\n6. South Australia - 4\n7. Two sites in Europe (nearer to the ice sheet) show larger temperature drops.\n\nF. A recent multivariate approach to the data (Ballentine and Hall, 1999) suggests that the\nerrors in the noble gas paleotemperature may be larger than stated by Stute et al., and that\nthe Brazilian data in particular should be regarded with caution.\n\nXII. In summary, continental evidence from low-latitude sites (mostly from higher elevations,\nhowever) favors a cooler, dryer climate during the last glacial maximum. But is this\nconsistent with the CLIMAP sea surface temperature reconstructions and the oxygen isotope\nvidence?\ne\nA. Rind and Peteet (1985) showed that a particular GCM (Global Circulation Model) for the\natmosphere could not reconcile CLIMAP with the continental evidence. In order to\nproduce a cooler, dryer low-latitude continental climate, they had to cool tropical surface\ntemperatures by 4°C in order to match the model climate with the continental\nobservations.\n\nB. Broecker (1986) argues that the oxygen isotope evidence favors CLIMAP, with some\npossible uncertainties.\n\nC. Is this discrepancy due to problems with one or both data sets, or is it a problem with the\nclimate model? More recent evaluations, using alternative marine paleotemperature\nmethods (alkenones, Mg/Ca) and revised foraminiferal transfer functions suggest that the\ntropics cooled a bit, but by not as much as the continents. However, Bard (1999) points\nout that in computer GCM climate models, the continents are cooler than the ocean -\npartly because of the 130 m sea level drop (hence continents are 130 m higher relative to\nsea level than today) and also because continental interiors are colder than marine-\ninfluenced boundaries.\n\nXIII.

This idea has been long on hope and slim on results,\nhowever.\n- There are many more species of benthic foraminifera, but these are scarce compared to planktonic foraminifera\n(B/P ~ 1%). Studies of benthic foraminifera require much larger samples (10g or more) and take much longer to\nprocess and identify.\n- Benthic foraminifera do show large-scale variations throughout the present ocean, and temporal changes are\nrecorded in sediment cores. The first studies were of necessity limited to small regions, and the temptation to\noverdo the planktonic analogy was great; hence depth-correlated changes in the modern ocean were at first\nattributed to temperature. (e.g. see Streeter, Schnitker studies).\n- Subsequent work has shown that, unlike planktonic foraminifera, correlations with temperature do not hold\nglobally. This lack of correlation probably is due to the extremely small range of variation of temperature (a few\n°C) in the deep ocean. There have been attempts to attribute the observed variations to other deep-water\nparameters (e.g. oxygen content, carbonate saturation, or even the vaguer term \"Uvigerina water\" which implies\nthat something in the bottom water controls the Uvigerina population). So far, none of these attempts has a\n\"residence time\" of more than a few years. So far, benthic foraminifera have defied a systematic generalization\nof the factors controlling their species composition. A recent paper by P. Loubere characterizes benthic foram\ncensus data from the Pacific in terms of surface productivity and deep water oxygen content.\n- It is likely that factors other than deep water properties influence the benthic foraminiferal populations: e.g.,\nfood (from the surface) - a correlation between benthic foram flux and productivity has been observed;\nsedimentation of non-food constituents; other aspects of the sedimentary environment (deep currents, grain size,\netc.).\nOne question of some interest to this \"other factors\" issue is: where do benthic foraminifera live? If they live at\nsome depth in the sediment, the chemical environment they respond to can be different from those at the bottom\nof the ocean: while T is the same, the chemical composition of the water, the food sources, oxygen, etc. may\ndiffer significantly from that of the bottom water. (To be expanded upon later.)\n\nBenthic Foram Paleoecology II\nFew paleoceanographic interpretations based on benthic foraminifera populations survived more than\na few years. One partial exception is the study of Streeter and Shackleton (1979) who used glacial\nincreases in the Uvigerina abundance to argue that North Atlantic Deep water ceased or drastically\ndiminished. Although the extent of the decrease is now thought to be considerably less than the\nforaminiferal populations would suggest, it is agreed that there was less North Atlantic Deep Water\nin the deepest North Atlantic during glacial times, and so at least the sign was right!\nStreeter and Shackleton, 1979\nImages removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nδ 13C as a tracer of deep ocean paleoceanography\nThe distribution of δ13C in the modern ocean is linked to oxygen and nutrients.\n- Organic matter is depleted in 13C. This depletion occurs mainly during the enyzymatic\nconversion of inorganic CO2 (itself somewhat depleted related to total dissolved CO2, which\nis mainly HCO3-) to organic matter by plants, mainly a kinetic effect.\nMuch of the carbon uptake by marine photosynthetic organisms is achieved by the transport\nof free aqueous CO2 (which is depleted in 13C by ~10%) across cell membranes (although\nthere are also some ways to use anionic HCO3- directly). Furthermore, because CO2(aq)\nconcentrations are low (10-20 μmol/kg), the cell membrane environment can be depleted in\nCO2(aq) during rapid photosynthesis because the conversion of HCO3- to CO2. is relatively\nslow. Enzymatic (Rubisco) and other kinetic effects within plants add to this 12C depletion,\nresulting in the δ13C of marine organic ranging from -20% (tropical and subtropical waters)\nto -30% (Antarctic).\n- When this organic matter sinks into the deep ocean, it quantitatively decomposes (~99% in\nthe whole water column; ~80% in the upper 500 m), releasing the bound C, N, and P in the\nsame ratio, and consuming O2 from the water in the process. The CO2 released during this\nrespiration process is depleted in 13C, so that the δ13C of the deeper water lower than that of\nthe original surface waters. A plot of δ13C vs. P for the modern ocean is linear.\n- Hence it is possible to use the δ13C distribution in the ocean as a tracer of oceanic water\nmasses.\n\nδ 13C as a tracer of deep ocean paleoceanography III\nDuplessy et al. (1984)\nCor\ne\nto\np\n\ncal\nibr\na\nt\nions\n.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nComplication: at least some\nspecies (especially Uvigerina),\nand perhaps all, appear to have\nvariable offsets from bottom\nwater composition related to the\nproductivity of the overlying\nsurface ocean.\nZahn et al. (1987)\nImages removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nMore complications:\n- where in the sediment do foraminifera live? If they live at some depth in\nthe sediment, δ13C can be significantly different from that of the bottom\nwater (e.g. McCorkle et al.).\n- The average δ13C of the ocean is not constant, due to a significant transfer\nof terrestrial reduced organic into the oceans during glacial periods (tropical\naridity and destruction of high-latitude hardwood forests: Shackleton\n(1977). This means that a local downcore records of δ13C have a large (and\noften dominant) component due to changes in the ocean average δ13C, and\nit is necessary to somehow correct for this in determining the spatial δ13C\ndistribution at a given time.\nBecause of these complications, early δ13C studies of benthic foraminifera were\n\"incomplete interpretations\", modified later. For example, Shackleton (1977)\nattributed the 13C changes from Uvigerina off Northwestern Africa (core M12392)\n(almost) solely to changes in the global oceanic δ13C due to a diminished LGM\nsoil/biospheric carbon reservoir.\n\nShackleton M12392, off of Northwest Africa\nNote that this figure is slightly\nmisleading because the\n\"Uvigerina\"record is actually a\n\"Uvigerina + Cibicidoides converted\nto Uvigerina scale\" composite\nrecord. It turned out later that a lot of\nthe C13 \"signal\" in this core was due\nto the variable C13 offset for\nUvigerina in high organic carbon\nglacial sediments (although the\n\"continental biomass\" argument is\nstill accepted as part of the benthic\nC13 record. Later, Shackleton,\nImbrie, and Hall (1983) attributed\nthe difference between Atlantic and\nPacific records to NADW\nfluctuations (which would have\ntherefore been a large portion of the\ntotal δ13C record in the Atlantic core.\nZahn et al. (1986) showed that\nUvigerina shows variable δ13C\noffsets from bottom water that are\nrelated to the organic carbon content\nof the sediment (which they\nsuggested was due to an infernal\nhabitat for Uvigerina). The\nNorthwestern Africa (core M12392)\nUvigerina record contains a large\ncomponent due to organic-carbon\nsource related non-constant δ13C\noffsets for Uvigerina. Hence the role\nof NADW fluctuations was smaller\nthan it appeared in the 1983 paper.\nO\nx\ny\ng\ne\nn\niso\ntope\nand\ncar\nbo\nn\nis\noto\npe.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nShackleton, Imbrie, and Hall (1983)\nHowever, so far it appears that the species. C. wuellerstorfi records the more reliable\nrecord of temporal and spatial variations in C-13 [though even this species also shows\nnegative δ13C offsets in some environments (e.g. Mackensen, 1993)].\nImages removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nThe \"Mackensen Effect\"\nMackensen et al.

Hence Cd plots linearly with P; both are\nnear-zero in subtropical surface waters.\nBoyle (1994)\nImages removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nCd/Ca in foraminifera as a tracer of ocean chemistry and circulation II\nCd has nearly the same ionic radius as Ca; hence it is well-suited to solid-solution substitution in the\ncalcium carbonate crystal.

Boyle (1981) demonstrated that ultrasonically-cleaned foraminifera shells contain in\ntotal 100-1000 times more cadmium than is actually contained in the lattice. This cadmium is\ncontained in ferromanganese coatings on the surface of the shells which can be removed by a\nreductive cleaning treatment. In some environments, precipitation of manganese carbonate\n(MnCO3) on the surfaces of foraminifera also leads to excessive Cd levels; it is more difficult to\nselective remove this phase, although acid leaching can preferentially dissolve the outer surfaces\nrelative to the interior calcite.\n- Studies by Boyle and Keigwin (1982; 1984 a,b; 1985) have shown that the δ13C results from C.\nwuellerstorfi and Cd/Ca in several species including C. wuellerstorfi, C. kullenbergi, Uvigerina,\nand N. umbonifera are consistent and indicate that the nutrient content of the deep North Atlantic\nwas about twice as high during the glacials as it is during the interglacials, which is consistent with\na significant reduction in NADW, but not with cessation.\n- Aragonitic Hoeglundina as a deep water Cd tracer.\n- McCorkle, Lea et al. (1995)showed that C. wuellerstorfi from very deep Pacific cores had lower\nCd than expected from bottom water chemistry\n- Marchitto (2004) confirmed that there was no significant temperature effect on benthic\nforaminiferal Cd in the range 4°C-18°C.\n\ncalcitic Cd/Ca partition\ncoefficient appears to\nbe a function of depth\n(Boyle, 1992)\n\nCd/Ca in foraminifera as a tracer of ocean chemistry and circulation III\nDetermination of the equilibrium partition\ncoefficient is difficult (because of rampant\ndisequilibrium and slow kinetics at low\ntemperatures). And of course, organisms may\nchoose to use their energy resources to create\ndisequilibrium fractionations. Best course is to use\nempirical approach to see if the cadmium content\nof the foraminifera is proportional to the cadmium\ncontent of the water the organisms grown in. This\nhas been approached by feeding radioactive\ncadmium to planktonic foraminifera (Delaney, Be)\nand by looking at the distribution of Cd in core-top\nbenthic foraminifera relative to the bottom-water\nCd content (Boyle, 1988). These studies show that\nthe Cd content of a variety of deepwater (>2500m)\ncalcitic foraminifera is proportional to the Cd\ncontent of the water, with Dp ≈2.9 ± 0.6 . In\nshallower cores, the situation for Cd is more\ncomplicated. Coretop calibration shows that D\nchanges with depth from ~1.3 at z<1100 to D~2.9\nat z>2900 m. Boyle (1992) proposed that cadmium\nin the water (\"CdW\") should be estimated from\nthis relationship when comparing data from depths\ncrossing this transition. Fortunately, the aragonitic\nbenthic foraminifera Hoeglundina elegans appears\nto little or no depth dependence for D (Boyle et al.,\n1995), which allows one to check whether the\ninferred depth dependence is stable.

Correlation\n\nA. Variance and Covariance\n\n1. Variance (of x is denoted Sx2; variance of y is denoted Sy2) is a measure of the\nscatter of values of a variable about its mean:\n\nSx\n2 =\n(xi -x)\ni =1\nn\n∑\n/ n\n\n2. Covariance (of x and y) expresses the relationship between two variables (a\nmeasure of the scatter of values of points in a plane relative to the centroid of\nthe data set):\n\nSxy\n2 =\n(xi -x)\ni =1\nn\n∑\n(yi -y) / n\n\nB. Correlation coefficient\n\nr =\nn -1\n(xi -x\nSx\ni=1\nn\n∑\n)( yi -y\nSy\n) =\nn -1\n(xi -x)(yi -y)\ni=1\nn\n∑\nSxSy\n\n_\nwhere Sx = std. dev. of x = (Σ(xi-_x )2/n-1)1/2\n\nand Sy = std. dev. of y = (Σ(yi-_y )2/n-1)1/2\n\ni.e. Sx and Sy relate the deviations of points from the average relative to the\n\"range\" (actually std. dev.) of the observations.\nIn other words, the Covariance divided by the Variance.\n\n3. r2 is \"the variance of Y accounted for by its\ncovariance with x\" (usually expressed in % units).\n\nC. Relation to linear regressions (x on y; y on x; others)\n\n1. Common linear regression of y on x: y = A + Bx\n\nLet S = Σ (yi - A - B xi)2\n\nSet ∂S/∂A =0; ∂S/∂B =0; solve for A and B.\n\n2. Matrix math solution of Linear Regression:\n\nfor eq'n Ax = b (m eq'ns, n unknowns),\nif columns of A are linearly independent,\nthen:\n\nx = (A\nTA)\n-1A\nT b\n\na. For example, for the simple linear regression\n\ny = C + Dx,\n\nwhere we want to fit pairs of data\n\nxi, yi\n\nwe want to find\n\nC, D\n\nthat mimimize\n\nΣ [yi - (C + Dxi)]2\n\nIn matrix form, we write the equation y = C + Dx as:\n_ _ _ _\n| 1 x1 | _ _ | y1 |\n| 1 x2 | | C | | y2 |\n| . . | | D | = | . |\n| . . | _ _ | . |\n| 1 xn | | yn |\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_ _ _ _\n\ni.e. A x = b\n\nNumerical example:\n_ _ _ _\n| 1 1 | _ _ | 4.1 |\n| 1 2 | | C | | 5.9 |\n| 1 3 | | D | = | 7.8 |\n| 1 4 | _ _ | 10.3 |\n| 1 5 | | 12.1 |\n_\n_\n_\n_ _ _ _\n\ngives C = 1.92 and D = 2.04\n\nSimilarly, to solve the equation y = A + Bx +Cx2:\n_ _ _ _\n| 1 x1 x12 | _ _ | y1 |\n| 1 x2 x22 | | A | | y2 |\n| . . | |_B_| = | . |\n| . . | | C | | . |\n_ _\n| 1 xn xn2_| _ _ | yn _|\n_\n_\n_ _ _ _\nb. Simple matrix formulas also allow you to compute the estimated uncertainties\nof the regression coefficients and the correlation coefficients.\n\nII. Correlation in n dimensions\n\nA. Multiple linear regression (e.g. y = a + bx1 + cx2, the equation for a plane in 3D\nspace)\n\nB. r-matrix (later we will refer to this as the matrix Σ)\n\nProperty 1 2 3 4 5\n\n1 1.00 0.86 0.45 0.83 0.45\n2 0.86 1.00 0.74 0.23 0.64\n3 0.45 0.74 1.00 0.78 0.57\n4 0.83 0.23 0.78 1.00 0.39\n5 0.45 0.64 0.57 0.39 1.00\n\n(ρij)\n\nC. Ellipsoids and eigenvectors\n\nA x = λ x\n\nsquare eigen- eigen-\nmatrix vector value\n\nOne way to find eigenvectors:\n\n1st eigenvector = major axis of ellipsoid\n2nd eigenvector = largest minor axis of ellipsoid\netc.\n\nThis works more or less as if we did a regression to get a line that \"explains\"\nBi\nva\nriate scatter diagram.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare. Adapted from source: Joreskog et al. Geological Factor Analysis (1976).\n\nmost of the variance (the dominant linear trend of the data in n-dimensional space),\nsubtracted that regression from the data, then perform another regression to find\nthe next most important contribution to the variance, and so forth.\n\n1. This procedure works because we can rewrite the equation (II.C.) as:\n\n(A - λI) x = 0 (Equation II.C.1)\n\nIn other words, the unknown vector x is orthogonal to all row vectors of\n(A-λI).\n\nThe expression for the determinant of A-λI is a polynomial of degree equal to the\nnumber of rows and columns of the square matrix A. The roots of the\npolynomial are the eigenvalues. If A is a real, square, and symmetric matrix, the\nroots are always real. However, these p eigenvalues may not always be\ndifferent and some may equal zero. If two or more eigenvalues are equal, we\nsay that they are multiple eigenvalues; otherwise we say the eigenvalue is\ndistinct.\n\nExample: consider a 2x2 symmetrical singular (i.e., determinant = 0) matrix;\nequation II.C.1 is then:\n\n| r11-λ r12 |\n| r21 r22-λ | = 0\n\n(r11-λ)(r22-λ) - r12r21 = 0\n\nλ2 - λ(r11+r22) + (r11r22 - r12r21) = 0\n\ni.e., a simple quadratic equation (also: remember, by assumption of\nsymmetry, r12=r21)\n\nThings get out of hand quickly as the matrix gets bigger (that's what computers\nare for!).\n\n2. Once the eigenvalues are known, the eigenvectors can be calculated from (a.)\n\na. A unique solution cannot be obtained for an eigenvector. If x is a solution, so\nis cx, where c is a scalar. By convention, eigenvectors are therefore always\nnormalized (unit length).\n\nb. Eigenvectors associated with different eigenvalues are orthogonal. Multiple\nsolutions are possible for multiple eigenvalues, but it is always possible to\nchoose an eigenvector which is orthogonal to all other eigenvectors.\n\n3. If the eigenvalues λ are placed as the elements of a diagonal matrix Λ, and the\neigenvectors are collected as columns into the matrix U, then eq. (II.C.1)\nbecomes:\n\nA U = U Λ\n\n_1 2 3.. n_ _1 2 n_ _1 2 3... n_ _1 2 3... n_\n1| | | EV1 EV2 ... | | EV1 EV2 ... | |λ1 0 0... |\n| | | ↓ ↓ | | ↓ ↓ | |0 λ2 |\n2| n x n | | . . | | . . | | . |\n| Square | | . . | = | . . | | |\n3| Matrix | | . . | | . . | | . |\n| | | . . | | . . | | |\n| | | . . | | . . | | |\nn|_ _| |_ . . _| |_ . . _| |_ λn|\n\n4. The matrix U (the eigenvector matrix) is square orthonormal (the matrix is nxn\nand the eigenvectors are of unit length), so U UT = UT U = I, therefore:\n\nA = U Λ UT\n\nTherefore any symmetric matrix such as the correlation coefficient table can be\nexpressed in this form:\n\nΣ = U Φ UT\nm x m m x N N x N N x m\nr-table\neigenvectors\neigenvalues\neigenvectors(transpose)\n\nIII. Principle Components Analysis: basically, the principle components are the\neigenvectors as outlined above:\n\nA. PCA is inherently variance-oriented; it accounts for maximum variance of all the\nobserved variables. In other words, PCA accepts that large part of the total variance\nof a variable is important and common to other observed variables.\n\nB. Factor analysis (below) is correlation-oriented; it accounts for the maximum\nintercorrelation of variables. In other words, factor analysis allows for a\nconsiderable \"amount of uniqueness\" to be present in the data and utilizes only that\npart of a variable that takes part in correlation with other variables; i.e., to account\nfor covariance rather than variance.\n\nExample: imagine a lake with three stream systems draining into it. Suppose that\neach of the drainage basins has a distinctive (average) sediment composition,\nand that the sediments within the lake can be described as linear combinations\nof the sediments derived from each stream system. What is interesting in this\ncase is the distribution of the three stream system component sediments, not\nthe mineralogy or chemical composition per se (i.e., we don't care if Al correlates\nwith Si). So we adopt a framework that lets us describe the raw data (chemical\nor mineralogical composition) in terms of sums of source components, and map\nthe distribution of the components.\n\nSource of example: Joreskog et al.\n\nIV.

Express each species percentage in terms of its deviation from the average for the\nsamples:\n\nPaL\nPaR\nGbu\nNdu\nSample 1 -9.5\n-2.7\n+5.9\n+6.2\nSample 2 +9.5\n+2.7\n-5.9\n-6.2\n\n3. Transpose:\n\nSample 1\nSample 2\nlength\nPaL\n-9.5\n+9.5\n13.42\nPaR\n-2.7\n+2.7\n3.77\nGbu\n+5.9\n-5.9\n8.38\nNdu\n+6.2\n-6.2\n8.80\n\n4. Row-normalize (to unit vector length):\n\nSample 1\nSample 2\nPaL\n-0.71\n+0.71\nPaR\n-0.71\n+0.71\nGbu\n+0.71\n-0.71\nNdu\n+0.71\n-0.71\n\n5. Plotting the species as vectors in sample space:\n\nNote that the PaL and PaR vectors coincide, as do the Gbu and Ndu vectors.\n\n6. In sample space, species that are highly correlated fall in the same vector region, i.e.,\nthere is a very small angle between highly correlated species.\n\na. The correlation coefficient is the cosine of the angle between the two\nPROPERTY vectors in sample space: Let a and b any two PROPERTY\nvectors (with a common origin). Then\n\naTb\nρ = cos θ = __________\n\n|a| |b|\n\nSo in this case, the correlation coefficient table is:\n\nPaL\nPaR\nGbu\nNdu\nPaL\n+1\n+1\n-1\n-1\nPaR\n+1\n+1\n-1\n-1\nGbu\n-1\n-1\n+1\n+1\nNdu\n-1\n-1\n+1\n+1\n\nSo (PaL and PaR) and (Gbu and Ndu) are positively correlated whereas\n(PaL and GBu), (PaL and Ndu), (PaR and Gbu) and (PaR and Ndu) are\nnegatively correlated.\n\nThis method of calculating the correlation coefficient is mathematically\nequivalent to the \"normal\" definition of the correlation coefficient given at the\nbeginning; i.e., this sample space diagram is the basis for the definition of the\ncorrelation coefficient!\n\nWhen there are only two samples as in this example, this definition seems as\nthere are only three possibilities: r = -1, 0, +1. This is because any two data\npairs define a straight line (unless they coincide, in which case no line is\ndefined) and this line has either a positive slope or a negative slope. But\nwhen there are more samples (i.e. multidimensional sample space), the data\npairs no longer have to define a line, the vectors can occur in any region of\nsample space, and r can have any value -1 < r < 1.\n\nIf A is the matrix with the row-normalized (i.e., unit length so that\n|a| = |b| =1) vectors of species data (relative to the mean for each species) in\nsample space, then the correlation coefficient table is the inner product of A:\n\nΣ = Α ΑΤ\n\n7. Likewise, one can define a similarity coefficient as the cosine of the angle\nbetween samples in PROPERTY space; it is a measure of how similar two\nsamples are to one another in their PROPERTY composition. We will call the\nsimilarity coefficient matrix H.\n\n8. What we are going to do next is reduce the number of \"species\" by combining\nthem into \"factors\". In other words, we are going to reduce our system from\nhaving (say) 31 species counts for each sample to having (say) 6 \"factor\nloadings\" for each sample.\nContinuing on from equation II.C.4., a math theorem says that a symmetric\nmatrix like the correlation matrix Σ can be expressed as:\n\nΣ = A Φ AT + Ψ\n\nwhere \"Σ is the p by p population covariance matrix of the observed variables\"\n(the symmetrical correlation coefficient matrix), \"A is the p by k matrix of factor\nloadings, Φ is the k by k covariance matrix for the factors (if the factors are in\nstandardized form, this is a correlation matrix with ones in the diagonal), and Ψ\nis the p by p residual covariance matrix.\"\nSource: Joreskog et al.\n\n9. If we force the solution to be orthogonal (factors are uncorrelated), then Φ = I\nand hence:\n\nΣ = A AT + Ψ\n\nΨ is now a diagonal matrix (i.e. there is\ncovariance between the factors)\n\n10. A math theorem tells us how to calculate the\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix:\n\nLet us assume that we have an N x p (N>p) data matrix X. The product moments\nare defined as:\n\nmajor product moment (MPM) V = X XT\nminor product moment (mPM) U = XT X\n\nThen we can decompose the data matrix as:\n\nX = V Γ U\n\nwhere\n\nV is an N by r matrix with orthonormal columns\nU is a p by r matrix with orthonormal columns, and\nΓ is a diagonal matrix of order r by r with positive diagonal elements γ1,\nγ2, ...γr called singular values of X.\n\nThe major product moment XXT, which is square, symmetric, and of order N\nby N has r positive eigenvalues and (N-r) zero eigenvalues. The positive\neigenvalues are γ12, γ22, ..., γr2 and the corresponding eigenvectors are\nu1, u2, ..., ur.\n\nThe minor product moment XTX, which is square, symmetric, and of order p\nby p has r positive eigenvalues and (p-r) zero eigenvalues. The positive\neigenvalues are γ12, γ22, ..., γr2 and the corresponding eigenvectors are\nv1, v2, ..., vr.\n\nThe positive eigenvalues of X XT and XT X are the same, namely γ12, γ22, ...,\nγr2 . Furthermore, if vm is an eigenvector of X XT and um and eigenvector\nof XT X corresponding to one of these eigenvalues γm2, then the following\nrelationships hold between um and vm :\n\nvm = (1/γm) X um and um = (1/γm) XT vm\n\nThese relationships make it possible to compute vm from um and vice-\nversa, i.e.\n\nV = X U Γ-1 and U = XT V Γ-1.\n\nThe analysis of the minor product moment XTX is referred to as R-mode\nanalysis and that of the major product moment XXT as Q-mode analysis.\n\n11. Major problem with this analysis: there are an infinite number of solutions! If we\nfind a solution to the problem (a set of orthogonal vectors that describe the\ndata), then any rotation of that set of vectors is also a solution! How do we\nchoose any one of these?\n\na. Rotation of a set of row vectors in the matrix X can simply be done through\nthe operation:\n\nY = X R\n\nwhere R is a rotation (transformation) matrix conforming to the requirement\nthat R RT = I for a rigid rotation.\n\nb. In the end, the choice is arbitrary (this is one of the problems with factor\nanalysis). However, certain more-or-less reasonable choices can be made:\n\ni. As much as possible, try to make the factors simple, i.e., have a few high\nloadings and many zero or near-zero loadings.\n\nii. Rotate the axes so as to put as much variance as possible into the factors\n(VARIMAX criterion). i.e., we try to \"explain\" as much of the variance as\npossible with the fewest possible factors. This solution is often favored\nbecause it is an objective solution (i.e., it arises untouched by human hands).\nThat doesn't necessarily make it a better solution, however.\n\n12. Brief summary of factor analysis steps:\n\na. Start with a data table with rows of samples and columns of species\nb. Row-normalize the data table so that each row has unit length. (it is now\nreferred to as W).\nc. Calculate the minor product moment (mpm) = WT W\nd. Calculate the eigenvalues (Λ) and eigenvectors (U) of the mpM.\ne. We can then express each sample in terms of the eigenvectors by multiplying:\nW U (the result of this calculation is a list of the eigenvector composition of\neach sample; e.g., each sample can be expressed as a linear combination of\nthe eigenvectors\nf. We now choose to simplify the properties of our data set by throwing out all\nbut the first few (dominant) eigenvectors, and then describe our data set in\nterms of these. This is now the factor matrix V, which describes the loadings\nof each species to each factor.\ng. Because we have thrown out some information, the factor loading matrix A =\nW V does not fit the original data exactly.\nh. In order to improve the fit somewhat, we will now rotate the factor matrix V so\nthat it accounts for as much of the variance as possible. This is done through\nan iterative process: we rotate around axis one to find the maximum, then\nrotate around axis two to find the maximum, etc. for all of the axes (= # of\nfactors). This process is repeated until the result converges (no further\nimprovement in fit is found).\ni. Our final rotated factor matrix (the Varimax solution) is F, a list of the\ncomposition of each species described as a linear combination of the\nindividual factors. The samples are now described as\n\n13. One problem with this type of analysis is that the number of factors is arbitrary!\nThe geologist's approach to choosing number of factors: make maps. Keep\nadding factors until additional factors become \"unmappable\".\n\n14. Negative factor problem: the mathematics don't specify that you only can add\nthings; the math is just as happy subtracting a factor. In chemical and physical\nreality, a sample can only be the sum of positive components (philosophically, it\nmay be possible to subtract components, e.g., incongruently dissolve something\naway to create a \"negative\" component of a different composition than the pre-\nexisting components). Various approaches to this problem: (a) ignore the\nproblem (most common), (b) rotate solution so that factors are (mainly) positive\n(but which rotation should you choose?)\n\n15. Another problem: summation to 100% and the \"...and everything else factor\"\n\nSupplementary Reading:\n\nJoreskog, Klovan, and Reyment, Geological Factor Analysis, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1976,\n178 p."

We can begin to ask the question: Why?\nTwo approaches:\n\n1. \"The physics\": derive ice ages from first principles. Good luck! (call me when you get there).\n\n2. \"Correlation (not causation)\": look for similarities (coincidences?) between certain driving\nforces known from first principles and the climate record. Examine the odds that such a\ncorrespondence is due to chance. If the odds are good, look into the relevant mechanism in more\ndetail. To be successful, this approach needs: (1) reliable climate record not excessively modified by\nbioturbation; (2) but the record also needs to be reasonably long so that many cycles are available\nfor statistical tests. Must compromise here! Eventually need to come to an accommodation with\n\"the physics\".\n\nI. Historically:\n\nA. 1840: Agassiz proposed massive continental glaciation; debate ensued which eventually was\ndecided in his favor\n\nB. 1860: Croll proposed that changes in the earth's orbital parameters were responsible for\nglaciation. Theory received a mixed reception.\n\nC. 1920 Milankovitch undertook detailed calculations which quantified the expected variations\nin the earth's orbital parameters. Theory still encountered a mixed reception.\n\nD. 1950's: Emiliani found stronger evidence for cyclic oscillations; tried to revive Milankovitch.\nProblem: time scale.\n\nE. 1960's, 70's: Barbados data (and hence correct time scale) revived interest in Milankovitch.\nTheory was being taken seriously, but it was considered far from proven.\n\nF. 1976: Hays, Imbrie, Shackleton paper. Overcame most of the resistance to some degree of\norbital influence over climate (at least as a \"pacemaker\" of ice ages).\n\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\nPlease see:\nFigure 6 in Imbrie, J., et al. \"On the structure and origin of major glaciation cycles 1. Linear\nresponses to Milankovitch forcing.\" Paleoceanogr 7 (1992): 701-738.\n\nG. At present, relatively few people doubt that orbital changes play a role in climate change, but\nthere are questions as to their importance relative to other factors. To what extent is climate\nactually predictable? Are there significant internal resonances that interact with orbital\nforcing? What is the origin of large amplitude sub-orbital climate variability? Can we parlay\nour understanding of past climate change into better predictions of future climate change?\n\nSome commentary on the last question: Climate models (to be discussed more later)\nincorporate a lot of first principle physics (e.g. laws of motion and thermodynamics) but\nbecause of the enormous complexity of the system and limited computer size and speed,\ncontain less definitive representations of sub-grid scale processes and poorly understood\nprocesses (e.g. convective precipitation; sea ice formation and melting; relation between\nsoil, vegetation, evaporation, precipitation and river runoff). In the aggregate, these\nfactors are extremely important, so they cannot be left out. Instead they are handled by\nempirical parameterizations containing \"fudge factors\" which are \"tuned\" to give a\nreasonable representation of modern climate. This approach is OK for weather\nforecasting, because many of these factors can't change fast enough to effect tomorrow's\nweather. But for climate change, these uncertainties are a serious problem. The sensitivity\nof the models to various forcing factors might be seriously mis-estimated by these\nparameterizations. One way to test the sensitivity of these models is to see how they\nbehave when driven by well-known forcing functions (e.g. a recent volcanic eruption).\nOne of the best known forcing functions linked to large climate change is the effect of the\nearth's orbital parameters on incoming radiation.\n\nII. Changes in the earth's orbital parameters and their influence on radiation receipt at the top of the\natmosphere. Root cause: gravitational interaction of earth with sun and planet. Precession due to\nthe gravitational field of the Sun, and tilt/eccentricity variations due to Sun-Jupiter tug-of-war for\nthe earth.\n\nA. The seasons result from the tilt of the earth's axis relative to the plane of the orbit (view from\nplane of orbit:\n\nEdge plane view (circular orbit):\nno rth ern\nwint er\nno rth ern\nsumme r\n\nOblique view, with exaggerated eccentricity\n\nB. Eccentricity = e = (a2 - b2)1/2 / a\na\nb\n\n1. For the earth, e varies between 0 and 0.06 quasi-periodically, with period of ~96,000 years\nand a longer (and higher-amplitude) period of ~400,000 years.\n\n2. The sun is at one of the foci of the ellipse. The earth moves faster when it is approaching\ncloser to the sun, and slower as it moves away.\n\n3. Looking down at the solar system from outer space (above the plane of the planetary\norbits), the ellipse precesses in its orientation:\n\ntime 1\ntime 2\n\neccentricity vs time:\n\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\neccentricity\nAge, ka bp\n\n2. Change in eccentricity doesn't affect globally averaged net annual solar insolation much,\nhowever (~0.1%) - losses in the summer are balanced by gains in the winter.\n\nC. Obliquity of the ecliptic (ε) (tilt of the earth axis relative to the plane of the orbit).\nε\n\n1. Obliquity varies between ~21.8° and 24.4°; at present the obliquity is 23.44°. Affects the\nlatitude of the tropics and the arctic circle. Period is ~41,000 years, and is relatively regular.\nThink of this as part of a solar system angular momentum oscillator (angular momentum\nconserved in solar system, but with transfers between objects).\n\nobliquity vs. time:\n22.00\n22.50\n23.00\n23.50\n24.00\n24.50\nobliquity, degrees\nAge, ka bp\n\nD. Precession of equinoxes. Physics is similar to a wobbling top; the precession frequency\ndepends on angular momentum of the earth and the torque imposed by the sun on a non-\nspherical earth.\n\n1. Precession of the earth's axis relative to the fixed stars has a period of 25,700 years. The\nclimatic affect (due to changes in the earth-sun distance as a function of season) depends\non an interaction between the precession period of the earth's axis with the precession\nperiod of the major axis of the orbit). In ~22,000 years, the earth ends up in a\nconfiguration where the radiation distribution cycle is complete:\n\nNorthern Summer\nNorthern Winter\nInitial state:\n~22,000 years later:\nNorthern Summer\nNorthern Winter\nEarth's axis has precessed 22/26 of a cycle, and the\neccentricity of the orbit has precessed \"backwards\"\n4/26 of a cycle, bringing us back to a configuration\nwhich is equivalent in terms of radiation\n\nThe net result is an effective ~22,000 year radiation cycle. The effect of precession on radiation\ndepends on the absolute eccentricity of orbit. When the earth has a nearly circular orbit around\nthe sun, precession of the axis produces no net radiation change for either season in either\nhemisphere. When the earth's orbit is more elliptical, there is a strong difference between\nradiation received between the hemispheres and between the seasons:\n\nsouthern\nsummer\n\ne sin ω is a simple measure of this radiation cycle.\n\nEccentricity \"amplitude modulates\" the precession radiation cycle.\n\nThe elements of the earth's orbit: :\n\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\nPlease see:\nThe image about elements of the Earth's orbit in Berger A. L., ed. \"The astronomical theory of\n\npaleoclimates.\" In Climatic Variations and Variability: Facts and Theories. 1981, pp. 501-538.\n\nE. These changes in the earth's orbital elements affect radiation received at the top of the\natmosphere (\"insolation\") as a function of hemisphere, latitude, and time of year.\n\n1. Effect of precession/eccentricity:\n\na. Inter-hemispheric radiation receipt: the hemisphere whose summer occurs during\nperihelion receives more insolation than the other hemisphere). The higher the\neccentricity, the stronger the contrast.\n\nb. Seasonal contrast within a hemisphere: as a hemisphere alternates between periods of\nsummer perihelion and winter perihelion, the seasonal contrast in insolation is\nmodified. The two hemispheres are out of phase with respect to this effect.\n\n2. Effect of obliquity: high-latitude summer insolation: high tilt leads to more radiation\nreceived at high latitudes during summer (that comes at the expense of the mid- and low-\nlatitudes; high-latitude winters not affected by changes in tilt).\n\nF. These orbital characteristics can all be calculated accurately via Newtonian mechanics into the\ndistant past (many millions of years). Accumulation of uncertainties (e.g. in relative masses\nof planets; shape and density distribution of planets) causes absolute values (i.e., which side\nof the sun is the earth on at some exact point in time in the future?) to be uncertain beyond\nseveral million years, although the frequencies are probably known reasonably well beyond\nthat time. For the last million years, we may regard these calculations as virtually\nunquestionable.\n\nIII. How do we make the comparison between these precisely calculable orbital changes and the\nrecord of climate change?\n\nA. Curve-matching is always popular. But given subjectivity, the possibility of phase lags, and a\nrubber time scale, this approach has drawbacks.\n\nB. Objective methods: many are possible, but for cyclic processes, Fourier analysis is a natural. It\nis nonetheless possible to be fool oneself with it's mathematical elegance, however; the\nstatistics assume certain characteristics that might not apply to the data at hand.\n\nIV. FOURIER POWER SERIES ANALYSIS\n\nA. Prism analogy: look at component frequencies of a time-variant process. Fourier showed that\nany reasonable function of time can be represented as a sum of sines & cosines.\n\nB. Theorem: Let G(t) be any well-behaved (continuous; differentiable; continuous derivatives)\nfunction. If we sample this function discretely in uniform time intervals (creating a series\nG(t1), G(t2), ...G(tn), then there is one (and only one) complex function S(f) = A(f) + B(f)i\n[where s is frequency and i is the square root of -1] such that\n\nG(t) = Σ (aj sin fj + bj cos fj)\n\nwhere fj = j/tn for j = 1 ... n\n\nThese harmonics fj are orthogonal (i.e. one cannot reconstruct fj wave as Σfk=j and complete\n(i.e. any \"reasonable\" signal in t can be fit perfectly & uniquely).\n\n1. Formal definition of fourier transform of the infinite time series G(t) is\n+inf\nS( f ) = ∫G(t)e-iωtdt\n-inf\nwhere ω = 2πf\na. Complex short-hand: eiy = cos y + i sin y\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1\n0.8sin(x)\n0.6cos(x)\n0.8 sin(x) + 0.6 cos(x)\n2. The Fourier transform is reversible:\n+inf\nG(t) = ∫S( f )eiωfdf\n-inf\n(i.e. both the Fourier transform and the time series contain equivalent \"information\", which\nalso means that we can do frequency-filtering using the inverse fourier transform)\nb. The Fourier Transform of a single sine wave is a spike at a single frequency. Similarly,\nthe Inverse Fourier Transform of a single spike frequency is a sine wave.\nC. Computation:\n1. Accepting the truth of the theorem, the discrete Fourier Transform is just an application of\nsimultaneous equations. For discrete uniformly-sampled data, we are taking N\nobservations of G(t), and converting to N/2 pairs of sin, cos coefficients. The number of\ncoefficients is equal to the number of observations, so this is an exercise in solving a\nsystem of N simultaneous equations. Let A = an N x N square array of the sin and cos\ntime series for each of the harmonics, where each row of the array (for i= 1 to N) is:\nsin(2πi/N)\ncos(2π\n.\n.\n.\n.\ni/N)\nsin(2 2πi/N)\nsin(2 2πi/N)\n...\nsin(N/2 2πi/N)\ncos(N/2 2πi/N)\n\ne.g.:\n\nsin(2π/N) cos(2π/N) sin(4π/N) cos(4π/N) sin(sin(6π/N) cos(6π/N) ...\nsin(4π/N) cos(4π/N) sin(8π/N) cos(8π/N) sin(sin(12π/N) cos(12π/N) ...\n...\n\nand let x = an N x 1 vector of the Fourier coefficients (a, b) arranged vertically:\n\na1\nb1\na2\nb2\n...\naN/2\nbN/2\n\nand let g = an N x 1 vector of the discrete observations of G(t):\n\ng(t1)\ng(t2)\n...\ng(tN)\n\nBecause the Fourier Transform theorem says:\n\n(a) g = A x\n\nthen the Fourier coefficients are given by the simultaneous equations matrix solution:\n\n(b) x = A-1 g\n\n(You might wonder if the rows must be linearly independent, ensuring that the inverse of X exists. In effect, the\nFourier theorem is a statement that they must be, for \"reasonable\" time series functions)\n\n2. The above method is one way to calculate the Fourier transform. However, the fastest,\nmost efficient route is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This is a simple routine which\ncalculates the solution to the series of simultaneous equations in a highly efficient way. It\noccupies about 64 lines of a BASIC program; see \"The Visible FFT\" spreadsheet to\nunderstand the algorithm). Typically, you either interpolate your data to give a series with\na power of two of evenly spaced (in time) data points (which usually makes sense because\npaleoclimatic data sets are usually unevenly spaced in time), or add \"trailing zeroes\" to\nyour data set until you reach a power of two.\n\n3. Older papers use the method of \"Blackman and Tukey\" which was developed before the\nFFT. It was commonly used throughout the SPECMAP project. It is based on the\n\"autocorrelation\" technique, which involves calculating the correlation coefficient of a\ntime series relative to itself (autocorrelation) after sliding the series by a variable number\nof \"lags\". The methods are mathematically equivalent, however, and the results should not\ndepend strongly on the technique used.\n\n4. However, expressing the method as in equation IV.C.1 points the way to alternative ways\nof calculating the spectra in situations involving unevenly spaced data and/or time series\nwith gaps. In those cases, one can convert the time series of IV.C.1. to a time series with\nsin, cos (X) values corresponding to \"times\" (t) of the individual measurements, regardless\nof their spacing. So the N rows in matrix A become\n\nsin(2π(t1- t1)/P)\ncos(2π(t1- t1)/P)\nsin(2*2π(t1- t1)/P)\ncos(2*2π(t1- t1)/P)...sin(N*2π(t1- t1)/P)\ncos(N*2π(t1- t1)/P)\nsin(2π(t2- t1)/P)\ncos(2π(t2- t1)/P)\nsin(2*2π(t2- t1)/P)\ncos(2*2π(t2- t1)/P)...sin(N*2π(t2- t1)/P)\ncos(N*2π(t2- t1)/P)\n......\n\nsin(2π(tN- t1)/P)\ncos(2π(tN- t1)/P)\nsin(2*2π(tN- t1)/P)\ncos(2*2π(tN- t1)/P)...sin(N*2π(tN- t1)/P)\ncos(N*2π(tN- t1)/P)\n\nwhere ti is the time corresponding to each observation (t1 is the first observation) and P is the\ntime length of the series of observations (tN-t1).\n\nThis format can result in a situation where there are more Fourier coefficients (which must\nremain as the harmonics of the time series record length) than observations. This situation\ncan be dealt with by ignoring the highest harmonics (i.e., chopping off the right hand side\nof IV.C.4 as necessary). In fact, it is possible to ignore most of the higher harmonics\nentirely [which often makes sense in paleoclimatic time series, where the error on the time\nscale renders the highest Fourier coefficients meaningless), resulting in a situation where\nthere are more observations than Fourier coefficients. In this case, equation IV.F.1.(a)???\ncan be solved using a least squares approach:\n\nx = (ATA)-1 AT g\n\nThese methods aren't as computationally efficient as the FFT, but given the power of\nmodern computers, the drain on computing power is trivial when relatively few spectra\nare being calculated.\n\n5. The finite discretely sampled time series Fourier transform treats the data as though it were\nperiodic, i.e. the measured time series repeats itself over and over again. This leads to\nsome problems: if first and last data points are quite different, the FT must use many high-\nfrequency harmonics of the fundamental frequency in order to create the sharp break.\n\nC. Nyquist folding frequency and aliasing: with a discrete sampling frequency, it is not possible\nto observe frequencies that are higher than half that sampling frequency. Even worse, the\nhigher frequencies come back at you as if they were signals of lower frequency (aliasing):\n\nThis flaw can be avoided by using a filter to eliminate frequencies that are higher than the\nNyquist frequency (such as sampling at a very high rate and integrating the signal for the\nduration of the sampling interval). Bioturbation is actually helpful here - you won't find\ndaily cycles in oxic marine sediment cores.\n\nD. Harmonics: the spectrum of a sawtooth (repeated linear trend) includes harmonics of the\nfundamental period P:\n\nresponse\ntime\n\nRelative Power\nP\nP/2\nP/3\nP/4\nP/5\nP/6\nP/7\nP/8\nP/9 P/10\n\nE. Because we stack finite-length time series end-to-end to obtain an effectively \"infinite\" time\nseries, we must take steps to avoid spurious harmonics due to record-length trends and\nsudden offsets between the beginning and end of a time series:\n\n1. De-trending: remove the long-term trend from the data (by a linear regression (or any other\nappropriate trend, which need not be linear).\ntime\n\n2. Tapering: in order to ensure that there are no abrupt mismatches between first and last data\npoints (e.g. a glacial connecting to an interglacial with no transition), the time series can\nbe tapered to zero at the beginning and end. For example, a \"cosine bell\" can be used for\nthis purpose (a cosine maximum to minimum multiplier) for the first and last 10% of the\ndata series. The subject of tapering is complicated, and at present it is generally agreed\nthat the \"optimal\" method is David Thompson's \"multitaper method\", which blends the\nresult from a family of tapers.\ntime\n\n3. These methods have some undesirable characteristics. In some cases, it may be preferable\nto avoid one or the other of these methods. For example, for a low-frequency sine wave,\ndetrending will tend to \"pick out\" the endpoints of the time series and could produce a\n\"tilted\" corrected sine wave. Best to apply thoughtfully while visually examining the\neffect the procedure has upon on the time series.\n\nF. Then: compute power spectrum\n\n1. Electrical analogy: Power = i2 R (where i = electrical current and\nR = resistance)\n\na. Amplitude of cycle at frequency j is (aj2 + bj2)1/2 (i.e., the length of the vector in\n(sin,cos) space, or the complex conjugate (a+bi)(a-bi). [where i here is the imaginary\nnumber, square root of -1]\n\nb. By analogy, then, aj2 + bj2 = power at frequency fj (i.e., the (amplitude squared) of\ncycle j).\n\nc. The measurement units of power are amplitude2/cycle per time unit.\n\nd. The logic behind using power spectra for climate processes is debatable. Power spectra\narose in the field of electrical engineering, so the choice is obvious in that context. It is\nnot so obvious in the case of sea level; even if you would want to know the change in\ngravitational potential energy due to changing sea level, it is not proportional to the\nsquare of the amplitude. In fact, it might often be more useful to present amplitude\nspectra, which can simply be related to the wiggles one sees in the data (e.g. meters\nchange of sea level). Typically, this is not done, solely because of the electrical origin\nof spectral analysis; statistical packages usually derive spectral estimates using\nprograms written for electrical analysis. In any event, it is straightforward to take the\nsquare root of the power to get the amplitude.\n\n|<-Period=1/frequency->|\n-1\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n\namplitude =\nsqrt(power)\n\n2. Periodogram:\n\nPower\nFrequency (cycles per time unit)\n95%CI\n\nlog(power)\nFrequency (cycles per time unit)\n95%CI\n\n3. Problem: Statistical significance of periodogram\n\na. White noise: equal energy (power) per frequency band ∆f (almost equivalent to random\nnumber series in time).\n\nb. Just as tossing a small number of coins is unlikely to give precisely 50% heads and\ntails, a finite time series is unlikely to have precisely equal energy per ∆f; in effect,\n\"counting statistics\" play a role; the longer the time series, the less the fluctuations\nwithin ∆f.\n\nc. Hence, a finite time series of a non-periodic function will show peaks and valleys in the\nperiodogram. We would like to define criteria so that we can assess the likelihood that\na peak observed in a real time series is due purely to chance.\n\nd. There are a number of \"rules\" around which purport to tell you \"how many cycles\" you\nneed to prove a periodic process; typically these rules specify 5 or 10 cycles. While\nthere is a grain of truth within these rules, they can be misleading. Is a record with\n\nonly 9 cycles unconvincing yet one with 11 cycles totally convincing? Of course, the\nstatistics follow a continuum, so there is little statistical difference in the reliability of\nrecords with 9 or 11 cycles. Perhaps a more fundamentally misleading characteristic of\nthese \"rules\" is that they ignore the relationship between the cycle you are trying to see\nand the characteristics of the rest of the variability. A very weak cycle (which\nnonetheless exists) can be hidden in the \"noise\" of the data or of the physical system; it\ncan take many more than 10 cycles to verify the existence of a weak cycle. On the\nother hand, the characteristics of a very strong cycle can be estimated reliably with just\na few cycles (although it is another thing to prove that those cycles couldn't have\noriginated from chance). Basically, these \"rules\" (and even the more objective\nstatistical tests) are oversimplifications; they do not excuse YOU from understanding\nwhat is required to prove the point that you are trying to make.\n\ne. For the periodogram, the following statistics apply to assess whether a peak of spectral\ndensity Pi is higher than expected from a white noise spectrum:\n\n90% CI 95% CI\n\nUpper Bound 19 Pi 39 Pi\nLower Bound 0.33 Pi 0.21 Pi\n\nObviously these limits are not very good! If we are to see more subtle characteristics\nof the spectrum, it is necessary to improve these statistics.\n\n4. Estimating a spectrum using a smoothing window (Daniell Estimator)\n\na. As with most collections of numbers, we can improve error bounds by averaging (at the\nexpense of detail). In a power spectrum, we can average adjacent frequency bands at\nthe expense of frequency resolution.\n\nb. Several methods have been proposed to accomplish this averaging; for most\ngeophysical time series, the simplest is adequate: the Daniell Estimator:\n\nPj =\nPj+k\n2n + 1\nk =-n\nk=+n\n∑\n\n(Note: in order to keep the spectrum frequency bands the same as the periodogram\nbands when averaging even numbers of bands, it is common to add the n-1 bands on\neither side of the central band, and add 1/2 of the bands on either side of these n-1\nbands).\n\nc. Define \"Equivalent Degrees of Freedom\" (EDF) r = 2n where n = # of periodogram\nbands included in average.\n\nChi-square table\n\nγ\n\nr 0.025 0.05 0.95 0.975\n\n2 .051 .103 5.991 7.378\n4 .484 .711 9.488 11.143\n6 1.237 1.635 12.592 14.449\n8 1.690 2.733 15.507 17.535\n_\nBound = (r/γ) Pj\n\n(1) Example: suppose 2 periodogram bands are averaged (r=4) and we want to know\nthe upper and lower bounds that must be exceeded to define a spectral peak at the\n95% confidence interval:\n_ _\nThe upper bound is : 4/.484Pj = 8.3 Pj\n_ _\nThe lower bound is : 4/11.143 Pj = 0.36 Pj\n\n(2) Since the bounds are multiplicative, error bars are fixed on a log-scale diagram:\n\nn=2 n=4 n=10\n_\n|\n| _\n| |\n| | _\n| | |\n| | |\no o o\n| | |\n| | _\n| _\n_\n\n5. Relationship between variance and power:\n\n2 Σ (ai2 + bi2) ∆f = Σ Xi2\n| |\nfreq. bandwidth data\n\n6. The resolution problem: From the definition of the fourier bands, it is obvious that\nresolution is poor for periods that are only a few multiples of the record length. What is\none to do if you want to get a higher resolution spectrum. The safe answer is: Don't try to\ncheat mathematics: get a longer record! There is a more dangerous alternative, however.\nSuppose you throw out every other data point in your time series, then add a string of\n\ntrailing zeros. In effect, you have doubled the length of your time series without having\nadded any data! While this may worry you, it doesn't bother the fourier transform at all,\nwhich will still happily compute the spectra. And it doesn't work too badly: in a test case\nwhere two sine waves corresponding to adjacent frequency bands in an original time\nseries had the resolution doubled this way, the new FFT in fact was able to resolve the\ntwo sine frequencies. However, in doing so, it also generated \"side bands\" with\nsignificant amplitudes. So the extra resolution of these two bands was obtained at the\nexpense of \"contaminating\" the rest of the spectrum. So in a real time series with a few\nstrong frequency peaks, this method will compromise your ability to look at the rest of the\nspectrum. Caveat FFTer!\n\n7. Optimal Spectral Estimation.\n\na. Tapering results in some loss of spectral power (most severe at low frequencies) and (in\nsome cases) loss of resolution between frequency bands. But it also minimizes\n\"leakage\", the tendency for spectral power to \"leak\" from one frequency into the\nestimate for adjacent frequencies.\n\nExample: a pure 41 kyr sine wave sampled 256 times during 510 kyr :\n-1.50\n-1.00\n-0.50\n0.00\n0.50\n1.00\n\n1.00E-04\n1.00E-03\n1.00E-02\n1.00E-01\n1.00E+00\n1.00E+01\n1.00E+02\n1.00E+03\n1.00E+04\n0.000\n0.020\n0.040\n0.060\n0.080\n0.100\nfrequency, cycles per kyr\nDetrended\nTapered\n\nNote that the detrended (nearly raw) time series shows spectral power at either side of the\nactual frequency which \"isn't really there\". Tapering improves this situation, but does\nnot eliminate all of the side-bands.\n\nb. This observation leads to a concern over \"optimal spectral estimation\"\n\ni. The simple Fourier transform/periodogram method described below works\nreasonably well for simple situations where a small number of well-separated\ndominant frequencies are present, and where you are only interested in dominant\npower at the dominant frequencies and not at the true weak power in the gaps\nbetween the dominant time series.\n\nii. In other situations, where you really care about extracting the best possible estimate\nof the true spectrum, you must move on to other techniques. Arguments have raged\nover optimal spectral estimation, but it seems that the winner is David Thompson,\nwho has shown that the best approach is to use a \"multi-taper\" strategy in which\nthe averaged Fourier transforms (from independent spectra computed using a set of\n\"eigentapers\") are used to retain as much information as possible. [Actually what\nhe says is :\"...spectral estimates based on the simple periodogram or unwindowed\nFFT (or equivalently, on sample autocorrelations) including indirect estimates (also\nknown as Blackman-Tukey (1958) estimates) or worse, adding misfit to bias, the\nautoregressive or 'maximum-entropy' estimates, must be considered both obsolete\nand extremely dangerous.\" (Thompson, 1990)]. This approach is beyond the limits\nof this course, but it is the right thing to do if you must have the best spectra.\n\nH. Coherence: How well are two time-series correlated within a frequency band [and what is the\nphase relation between the two time series] ?\n\ntime -->\nPhase Lag\n\ntime-->\nhighly coherent (with a phase lag)\n\n1. Coherence can be thought of as the \"correlation-coefficient in frequency-space\"; it is a\nnumber ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 reflecting perfect coherence; the statistical\nsignificance of a coherence estimate depends on the number of bands averaged.\n\n2. Given two 'records' (X,Y) each has a power spectrum\n\na2 + b2 = (a + ib)(a - ib)\n\n(i.e., the power spectrum is the complex conjugate of the fourier coefficents)\n\nΦX(S) = Σ X(S) X*(S)\n\nΦY(S) = Σ Y(S) Y*(S)\n\n(where * denotes complex conjugate; both ΦX(S) and ΦY(S)are real and >0)\n\n3. The cross-spectrum ΦXY is similarly defined:\n\nΦXY = Σ X(S) Y*(S)\n\n(aj+bji)(cj-dji) = ajcj + bjdj - (ajdj-cjbj)i\n\n= C + iQ (a complex number)\n\n4. Coherence is the normalized cross-spectrum (the cross-spectral power normalized to the\npower of the two series)\n\nΦxy\ncoh = _________ = C + iQ (a complex number)\n(ΦxΦy)1/2\n\n0 ≤ coh(x,y) ≤ 1\n\na. Band-averaging must be done (same definition as Daniell estimator), except that when\ncomputing phase, you must band-average the complex numbers before computing phase\n(think of the beating of nearby frequencies...). This is done as complex addition of vectors\nin the phase plane\n\n_ _\nC2 + Q2\ncoh = _______\n_ _\nP1 P2\n\n_ _\ncoherence magnitude = (C2+Q2)1/2\n\nphase\n_ _\nφ = tan-1 (Q/C)\n\nQ\nC\n\nQ\nC\nΦ\n\n5. Example:\n\nX aj + ibj\n\nY cj + idj\n\nXY = (a+ib)(c-id)\n\najcj + bjdj = Cj\nbjcj - ajdj = Qj\n\nThen band-average Cj + iQj (Daniell estimator)\n\nCoherence Phase\n\n1. cross-spectrum 1. cross-spectrum\n2. compute coherence 2. band-average\n3.

Paleoclimatic time series are often \"tuned\" to match orbital variability - in this case\nthe coherence between orbital parameters and the coherence of the tuned time series is\nfalsely elevated and isn't a particularly useful statistic (ref.).\n\nb. Phase\n\nerror = arcsin [ [(1-coh2)/(coh2(2n-2))]1/2 t2n-2 (α/2)]\n\nwhere t is the t-statistic and α is the desired confidence level, i.e. for 95% CI, α = 1-.05.\n\nH. Another useful technique is frequency filtering of data. There are several ways this can be\ndone; the simplest is to Fourier Transform the data, multiply the coefficients by multipliers (0\nto 1) (warning: multipliers should change slowly in adjacent bands; i.e. don't go from 0 to 1 in\nadjacent bands), and then perform the Inverse Fourier Transform.\n\nV. Spectral analysis of oceanic climate records.\n\nA. Imbrie and others made attempts many years ago, but problems with the time scale and other\nnot-fully-appreciated problems (e.g. bioturbation) precluded useful results. The imperfection\nof the time scale degraded the statistical significance of peaks that were more significant than\nthey appeared. [This should also caution us not to always accept the criticisms about the\nappropriate significance levels for geological time series when the inherent limitations the\ntime scale accuracy places on obtainable significance is not appreciated.]. By the early\n1970's, the time scale based on Barbados U/Th coral dates and linear interpolation from the\nmost recent paleomagnetic reversal (Brunhes-Matuyama) in core V28-238 (Shackleton and\nOpdyke, 1973) provided a time scale that was good enough for the first attack on this\nproblem. [Note: at the time that those papers were written, geophysicists had assigned a date\n\nof 730 kyrBP to the B-M reversal based on K-Ar dates. More recent 39Ar/40Ar dating work\n(Baksi et al. 1992) indicates that this reversal is closer to 780 kyrBP.]\n\nB. First widely accepted application was a 1976 paper by Hays, Imbrie, and Shackleton, in which\nspectral analysis was applied to a 450,000 year record of (radiolarian Imbrie-Kipp) T, δ18O,\nand the abundance of a particular radiolarian, C. davisiana.\nRC11-120, E49-18 Patch\n1.5\nDB\n2.0\nP\nO, %\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\nδ\n4.0\nAge, ka bp (SPECMAP)\n\n1. They found that spectral analysis of all of these records produced spectral peaks near 100,\n41, and 23-19 kyr (i.e., same as eccentricity, obliquity, and precession.\n\n2. The peaks appeared to be statistically significant (uhm..., sort of: their statistical test,\nwhich is differs from that given above, has been criticized and never successfully\ndefended...)\n\n3. This statistical coincidence earned the orbital variations the title of \"pacemaker of the ice\nages\".\n\n4. Because the time scale has relatively large uncertainties in the region between termination I\nand the B-M magnetic reversal, the phases of the cycles were not coherent with the orbital\ncomputations. By making numerous small adjustments to the time scale, well within the\nuncertainties allowed geologically, it is possible to maintain a consistent phase\nrelationship between the orbital indicators and the climate indicators for the last 450,000\nyears.\n\na. This finding gave rise to the concept of \"tuned\" time scales\" (e.g., SPECMAP time\nscale). Basically, in the absence of radiometric age control, the logic is:\n\ni. Within the errors of the geologic time scale, and in particular during the intervals\nwhere age control is good, orbital parameters seem to maintain a consistent phase\nrelationship with δ18O variations.\n\nii. So, ASSUME that this phase relationship holds for times when the age control is\nnot very good, and use perturbations of the original time scale to bring the\nprecession and obliquity cycles into consistent phase relationships.\n\niii. If we consider this technique only as a chronological tool subject to the eventual\nproof of the assumptions, this method is a reasonable means for interpolating time\nbetween known control points. But SPECMAP then proposed to do something\nmore dangerous: to use data on this new time scale to evaluate the orbital\nhypothesis! This might seem circular, and it is in part, but it isn't completely, since\n\nthe aim is to test parts of the orbital hypothesis that weren't tuned: e.g., the\neccentricity cycle, and other indicators that weren't specifically phase-locked onto\nthe orbital parameters. Also, to the extent that it is just used to examine the relative\ntiming of events in different regions and of different properties using the δ18O time\nscale, the tuning isn't really a factor. But there are problems: in a tuned system, the\ncoherence statistic is a poor indicator and was oft-abused in the SPECMAP-era\nliterature.\n\nC. Ruddiman and McIntyre (1981) found that (foram Imbrie-Kipp) T near 42°N in the Atlantic\nshowed a very strong precession-driven cycle, with little 41,000 power. One doesn't need an\nFFT to see this signal! This site and some other regions show strong and obvious orbital\nsignals.\n\nD. That the earth's orbital parameters has some influence on the earth's climate is now widely\naccepted (with a small minority of holdouts). The question that is more controversial is: how\nsignificant is the role of orbital parameters on climate change relative to other causes of\nclimate change? It is possible that other processes (internal drifts or resonances) are\ndominant, but that they simply lock onto the \"pacemaker of the ice ages\" (e.g., just as the\nenergy for a heartbeat always comes from the body, not the pacemaker). How can we\ninvestigate this problem?\n\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\n\nE.

Problem: The earliest observed response is found in the Southern Hemisphere - but the\nclimate system resembles Northern Hemisphere radiation curves! Why?\n8. Sha\nR.G. Johnson had proposed to use the orbital cycles as the \"tree rings\" of marine\nsediments, and use them to establish a time scale independent of other constraints. This\napproach was dismissed by SPECMAP, but later, Shackleton et al. applied spe\nanalysis tuning techniques towards this technique and proposed that the ages of sever\npaleomagnetic boundaries were significantly older than previously\n780 kyrBP). Independent 39Ar/40Ar dating (Spell and McDougall, 1992; Baksi et al.,\n1992) confirmed these new age estimates suggesting that Ar loss made some (but not all)\nK/Ar dates too young.\n\n9. \"The 100 kyr problem\": Why is dominant cycle ~100 kyr for the past ~million years when\nthere is very little 100K power in insolation spectra?
