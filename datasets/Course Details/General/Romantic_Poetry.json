  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nStudents are required to attend all class sessions and to participate. I do not evaluate class participation in terms of how many brilliant things you say in the course of the semester, but I require you to have read the texts thoroughly and to come to class prepared to talk about them. Failure to attend classes will negatively affect your grade; more than two unexcused absences will drop your grade by a letter, and more than three such absences will be considered grounds for failing the course. In addition, every student will be required to deliver 2-3 presentations on an assigned work during the semester. These presentations, between 10-15 minutes in length, should be conceived as exercises in literary interpretation through close analysis, and should ideally help to stimulate a discussion through arguments and questions.\n\nFor each essay assignment, a handout will be distributed detailing requirements and due dates. Feel free to come and discuss with me written assignments before they are due if you have any questions or problems.\n\nCourse Calendar\n\nDAY #\n\nTopics\n\nKey Dates\n\nWeek 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWeek 2\n\nReadings by Thomas Gray, Thomas Warton, and Charles Lloyd\n\nReadings by Anna Seward and Charlotte Smith\n\nWeek 3\n\nReadings by Wordsworth\n\nReadings by Wordsworth (cont.)\n\nWeek 4\n\nReadings by Wordsworth (cont.)\n\nWeek 5\n\nReadings by Coleridge\n\nReadings by Wordsworth, Coleridge, and John Thelwall\n\nWeek 6\n\nReadings by Coleridge (cont.)\n\nEssay 1 due (5-7 pages)\n\nReadings by Keats\n\nWeek 7\n\nReadings by Keats (cont.)\n\nReadings by Keats (cont.)\n\nWeek 8\n\nReadings by Keats and William Hazlitt\n\nReadings by Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nWeek 9\n\nReadings by Percy Bysshe Shelley (cont.)\n\nWeek 10\n\nReadings by Percy Bysshe Shelley (cont.)\n\nReadings by Percy Bysshe Shelley and Byron\n\nWeek 11\n\nReadings by Mary Shelley\n\nWeek 12\n\nReadings by Mary Shelley (cont.)\n\nReadings by Byron\n\nWeek 13\n\nReadings by Byron (cont.)\n\nReadings by Byron (cont.)\n\nWeek 14\n\nReadings by Byron (cont.)\n\nReadings by Byron (cont.)\n\nEssay 2 due (8-10 pages)",
