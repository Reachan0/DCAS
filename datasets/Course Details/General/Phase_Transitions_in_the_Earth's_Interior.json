  "course_description": "This course discusses phase transitions in Earth’s interior. Phase transitions in Earth materials at high pressures and temperatures cause the seismic discontinuities and affect the convections in the Earth’s interior. On the other hand, they enable us to constrain temperature and chemical compositions in the Earth’s interior. However, among many known phase transitions in mineral physics, only a few have been investigated in seismology and geodynamics. This course reviews important papers about phase transitions in mantle and core materials.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session\n\nPrerequisite\n\nPermission of instructor\n\nOverview\n\nPhase transitions in Earth materials at high pressures and temperatures cause the seismic discontinuities and affect the convections in the Earth's interior. On the other hand, they enable us to constrain temperature and chemical compositions in the Earth's interior. However, among many known phase transitions in mineral physics, only a few have been investigated in seismology and geodynamics. This course reviews important papers about phase transitions in mantle and core materials.\n\nThe topics include:\n\nOlivine-wadsleyite-ringwoodite, post-spinel, post-garnet, post-ilmenite, post-perovskite, coesite-stishovite, post-stishovite, and tetragonal-cubic Ca-perovskite transitions\n\nPhase transitions in Fe, Fe-Ni, Fe-S, Fe-Si, and Fe-O systems\n\nMelting of silicates and iron alloys\n\nSpin transitions in (Mg, Fe)SiO3 perovskite and magnesiowustite.\n\nThis course focuses on physical property changes, depth, and Clapeyron slopes of these transitions and implications for seismology and geodynamics.\n\nFormat\n\nThis course is structured as a series of student presentations based upon the course topics. Two students give presentations each week. See the\nassignments\nsection.\n\nGrading\n\nThe course grade is based upon class participation, discussions and presentations.",

      "content": "Seismic Evidence for Olivine Phase\nChanges at the 410- and 660-\nKilometer Discontinuities\nSergei Lebedev, Sebastien Chevrot,\nRob D. van der Hilst\n\nOverview\n- Some disagreement about what phase\nchange(s) cause the 660\n- Irifune et al (1998), e.g.: suggest post-spinel occurs at\n22 GPa, as opposed to 24 GPa\n- Seismic results ambiguous\n- Gt-Pv and Gt-Il-Pv suggested\n- This paper uses estimates of Vs from\ntomography studies and differential travel times\nfrom incoming Pds waves to calculate the\nseismic Clapeyron slope and thus constrain the\nphase changes that could be responsible for the\n660.\n\nSeismically Inferred Clapeyron Slope\n- It is not meaningful to define thermodynamic\nClapeyron slopes for the 410 and 660, since\nthere are multiple phases\n- Bina & Helffrich (1994) define the seismic\nClapeyron slope, which can be determined\nexperimentally and is dependent on\nthermodynamic properties.\n- Seismic Clapeyron slope can be affected by\nisostructural phases with variable chemistry at\nthe depth of the discontinuity, in particular\nbecause of the exchange of Mg and Fe between\nolivine and other minerals.\n\nCorrelation between TZ thickness\nand TZ temperature.\n- If the 660 is caused by the post-spinel phase\nchange, then the 410 and 660 should be\ndeflected away (towards) each other for a cold\n(hot) anomaly.\n- The height of the TZ (HTZ) would then correlate\nwith TZ temperature, as well as with Vs within\nthe TZ (since Vs is temperature dependent).\n- If the 660 is caused by the gt-pv transition, which\nhas a positive Clapeyron slope, the correlation\nbetween HTZ and temperature (and HTZ and\nVs) would be weak or absent.\n\nP410s and P660s have the same ray paths, to first order, so any time\ndifferences should be due to structure in the transition zone (TZ), where\nP660s is an S-wave and P410s is a P wave.\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\n\nInitial stations used\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\n\nData selection\n- Pds waves used to calculate tdiff:\nt(diff) = t(P660s) - t(P410s)\n- Reject traces with low signal-to-noise\nratios, stacks that didn't show both P660s\nand P410s, and stations which did not\nhave enough acceptable traces.\n- Used previously determined tomographic\nmodel values of Vs at their stations.\n- Reliable estimates for the upper (δVs410)\nand lower (δVs660) parts of the TZ obtained\nfor eight stations.\n\nStations used\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\n\nResults I\n- tdiff correlates with δVsTZ = δVs410 + δVs660 (r = .94)\n- For a TZ of constant thickness, tdiff would have negative\ncorrelation with velocity.\n- Convert tdiff to HTZ anomaly (δHTZ) using P and S\nvelocities from iasp91, δVsTZ, and R = δlnVs/δlnVp = 1.7\n+/- 0.7\n- Convert δVsTZ to δTTZ (temperature anomaly) using\ndlnVs/dT = -1.35 x 10-4 K-1 and a 0.4 x 10-4 K-1\nuncertainty.\n- HTZ correlates with δTTZ with r = 0.98; slope of best\nfitting line = -0.13 =/- 0.07 km/K; consistent with slope\ninferred from mineralogical Clapeyron slopes of alpha-\nbeta and post-spinel phase changes.\n\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\n\nResults II: Clapeyron slope\n- Use δVs estimates to compute seismic\nClapeyron slopes (γ410 and γ660)\nδHTZ = (dd/dP)660 x γ660 x (dT/dlnVs)δlnVs660\n- (dd/dP)410 x γ410 x (dT/dlnVs)δlnVs410\n(dd/dP)660(410) describes the depth-pressure\nrelationship at the 660(410)\n- Find γ410 and γ660 by minimizing chi-square\nfunction δHTZi - δHTZ, δHTZi the data at\nthe ith station and δHTZ calculated\n\nSmall square is mineralogical\nClapeyron slope from Bina & Helffrich\n(1994); large rectangle is range of\nvalues as compiled by Bina &\nHelffrich (1994)\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\n\nConclusions\n- The seismic Clapeyron slopes found for\nthe 410 and 660 are consistent with the\nmineralogical Clapeyron slopes of the\nolivine transformations\n- Inconsistencies with other studies, where\nweak correlations between tdiff and VsTZ\nhave been found, is due to differences in\nspatial resolution between tdiff and VpTZ\nand VsTZ from global tomography."

J. \"The effect of H2O on the 410-kilometer\nseismic discontinuity.\" Science 268 (1995): 74-76.\n\nH2O Effect on 660-km Discont.\n- Phase transformation from γ Æ Pv + Mw at 660 km is\nalso sensitive to H2O content.\n- If H2O partitioning between two phases is 10:1 in favor of\neither, the transformation interval must be broadened.\n- If H2O favors Pv Æ trans. interval would be broadened to\nlower pressure.\nIf H2O favors γ Æ trans. interval would be broadened to\nhigher pressure.\n- Observed width of discont. < 5 km will be consistent only\nwith < 1000 ppm H2O in γ phase if the discontinuity is\nisochemical.\n?\n?\n\nImplications for the correlation between\nseismic observations and phase relationships\n- Seismic results: H2O may be released from subducting\nlithosphere in two depth interval (<100 km and 300 Æ\n500 km).\n- Nolet and Ziehuis: from 300 to 500 km, the low S-wave\nvelocities above an ancient subduction zone could only\nreasonably be accounted for by the weakening of the\nshear modulus because of the presence of H2O or small\namounts of hydrous partial melt.\n- Author's suggestion: further seismic experiments on the\nnature of 410 and 660 km discont. in the 'wet' region of\nsubduction zone. (elevation and broadening of these\ndiscont. ???) (If yes, isochemical changes; if no,\ncombined phase and bulk compositional changes)\n\n- Structurally bound H2O contents in lower pressure mantle\nminerals: garnet < xenoliths (olivine)<< pyroxene\n- Olivine is a more important host for H2O at 410 - km\ndisconti. than it is the shallow mantle because\n(1) the proportion of pyroxene declines with depth as it\ndissolves into garnet with depth, i.e., a H2O rich mineral\nreplaced by a H2O poor mineral.\n(2) data on natural samples: a stronger pressure effect\non H2O in olivine than in pyroxene. Bell et al. argued that\nolivine is the major reservoir for H2O below 200 km.\n(3) experimental results: H2O content of pyroxene similar\nto that of olivine at 14 GPa.\n- Structurally bound H2O may explain the apparent breadth\nof transition interval ( ~ 0.5 GPa > 0.25 GPa with 0 H2O)\nin experiments, perhaps due to that it's impossible to\nexclude H2O from these high pressure experiments.\n\n- Is there any other minor elements affecting\nthe olivine - β phase transition ?\nRecent experiments show no evidence!
