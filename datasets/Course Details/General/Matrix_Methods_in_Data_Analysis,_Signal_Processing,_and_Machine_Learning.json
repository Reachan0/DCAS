This course reviews linear algebra with applications to probability and statistics and optimization-and above all a full explanation of deep learning.\n\nTextbook\n\nStrang, Gilbert.\nLinear Algebra and Learning from Data\n.\nWellesley-Cambridge Press\n, 2019. ISBN: 9780692196380.\n\nProfessor Strang created\na website for the book\n, including a link to the\nTable of Contents (PDF)\n, sample chapters, and essays on\nDeep Learning (PDF)\nand\nNeural Nets (PDF)\n.\n\nRequirements and Grading\n\nThere are homework assignments, labs, and a final project. The grade is based on all three elements. NOTE to OCW USERS: The OCW site includes problems assigned for every lecture, aligned with readings in the course textbook. The on-campus students had weekly problem sets.",
