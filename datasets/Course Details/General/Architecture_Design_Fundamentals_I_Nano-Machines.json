  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nStudio: 2 sessions / week, 3 hours / session\n\nStudio Overview\n\nThis studio aims to develop and further our understanding of architecture through the lens of nano-scale machines, technologies and phenomena. The Nano-Machine will become an apparatus, a device, a system and an architecture for understanding inputs, processes and outputs that can lead to the creation of space. Three primary engines of drawing, making and spatial investigations will be employed to elaborate on that theme. Different connotations of the \"machine\" such as an analogy, a system of working, and a device for decision making literally and conceptually throughout each project will be explored. This course is specifically designed to play off of the students' non-architectural undergraduate classes by introducing a domain of investigation through which a dialogue can be created to span multiple backgrounds and applications. This studio will investigate the notion of self-assembly/self-replication/self-repair/self-reconfiguration and other such phenomena present at the nano-scale and explore contemporary spatial design possibilities through new developments in nano-robotics, DNA origami, synthetic biology, medical devices etc.\n\nWe will investigate the Nano-Machine with three projects:\n\nCritically investigating the act of drawing by developing processes and templates that will allow students to reveal the internal logic of the subjects they study--i.e., \"\nThe Drawing Machine\n.\"\n\nInvestigating the drawings as devices capable of shaping 3-dimensional physical objects and systems. The students will cast a series of constructs employing additive, subtractive and combinatorial operations--i.e., \"\nThe Making Machine\n.\"\n\nCreating space by examining notions of the solid and the void, inside, outside, scale, context--i.e., \"\nThe Architecture Machine\n.\"\n\nDetailed descriptions, schedules, and deliverables for each of the projects are available under\nAssignments\n. Samples of student work from the Fall 2012 studio are available under\nProjects\n.\n\nStudents should also be able to engage with an increasing level of design research through iterative studies and move fluidly between different modes and scales of operation. Conventions of architectural representation and communication through drawing and modeling should be engaged with clarity and intention. Students will need to demonstrate basic application of design skills, understanding of architectural conventions, and ability to sustain an increasing level of research in the projects over the semester. Completion of each of the exercises, rigor in process and clarity in representation, as well as the overall progress of the semester will be fundamental factors in the final evaluation.\n\nRequired Resources\n\nA variety of tools and software are available for the design process, which includes form exploration, modeling, and producing drawings. For Project 1, students will be asked to use\nProcessing\n, an open source programming language, to develop digital generative drawings. Over the course of the studio, students are encouraged to develop their abilities in modeling their designs as well as producing representations and drawings using\nRhinoceros\n(r)\n.\n\nEvaluation Criteria\n\nThe following criteria will be used for the evaluation of your work, both in terms of helping your progress and in final grading.\n\nThesis\n: How clearly are you articulating your conceptual intentions?\n\nTranslation of Thesis\n: How well are you using your thesis to develop a spatial and architectural response to given problems?\n\nRepresentation Appropriateness\n: How well-matched is your choice of representational means to your intentions?\n\nRepresentation Quality\n: How accomplished are you with drawing, modeling, digital representation, etc.? To what degree do your representations convey what they ought to?\n\nOral Presentation Skills\n: How clearly are you presenting your ideas orally, whether at your desk, in class discussions, or to a more formal jury?\n\nParticipation in Discussions\n: How actively and how constructively are you involved in class discussions, both formally and informally?\n\nResponse to Criticism\n: How do you effectively take advantage of criticism from instructors, your classmates and outside jurors?\n\nAuto-Critical Skills\n: To what extent are you able to critique your own work regularly and effectively?\n\nAttendance\n: Attendance for the full duration of each studio is mandatory. The studio is an exceptional learning environment that requires your physical presence as well as your intellectual presence. You are allowed three excused absences for the semester. Absences beyond the three allotted will result in a decrease in your final grade. If you miss six or more studio classes, you will be asked to drop the subject or receive a failing grade.\n\nGrading\n\nProject grades will be assigned according to the following:\n\nExcellent\n--Project surpasses expectations in terms of inventiveness, appropriateness, verbal and visual ability, conceptual rigor, craft, and personal development. Student pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class.\n\nAbove Average\n--Project is thorough, well researched, diligently pursued, and successfully completed. Student pursues ideas and suggestions presented in class and puts in effort to resolve required projects. Project is complete on all levels and demonstrates potential for excellence.\n\nAverage\n--Project meets the minimum requirements. Suggestions made in class are not pursued with dedication or rigor. Project is incomplete in one or more areas.\n\nPoor\n--Project is incomplete. Basic skills including graphic skills, model-making skills, verbal clarity or logic of presentation are not level-appropriate. Student does not demonstrate the required design skill and knowledge base.\n\nFailure\n--Project is unresolved. Minimum objectives are not met. Performance is not acceptable. This grade will be assigned when you have excessive unexcused absences.\n\nStudio Culture\n\nWork in the studio will build sequentially. Therefore, commitment to incremental development on a daily basis is of paramount importance. Charrettes before reviews will not suffice. The demanding nature and pace of studio courses necessitates regular attendance and requires that deadlines be consistently met. In addition to lowering your grade, late work will prevent you from following the overall structure of the course. It is important that you take advantage of the studio environment. Magnification of your development as a designer is made possible by the collective nature of the studio. Working in studio, instead of at home, will allow you to participate in the dialogue of the studio setting. Group reviews are collective for a reason, as each student has something to gain from peer students.",

Take the four drawings from exercise one and attempt different\nconfigurations for assembling them within the boundary of a box (1'x1'x1'). Develop a process of linking your\ndrawings in the bounding box or further developing your Processing sketch to end-up with a 3D solid/void\nmodel in Rhino. You will be developing a mold-making technique to eventually cast the solid portion of your\nmodel. The volume of the poured cast should occupy no more than 75% of the total volume of the box. Take\na position on the relationship between surface area and solid/void - does your processing system generate\nsurface, solid or void - what is solid and what is void, why?\n\nThink of your drawings as a machine that manipulates and informs the plaster. How does plaster give a new\nreading of your system? Draw 2 horizontal cuts (plans) and 2 vertical cuts (sections) and 1 axonometric\ndrawing through your cast object at 1:1 scale. Map out the solid and void in your drawings. Determine which\norientation seems more appropriate to allow or block the flow of plaster. Determine cavities vs. solid spaces,\nnotice thin faces vs. thick ones. Dwell on the extreme conditions created in your cast object, and build upon\nthem using your precedent logic, your drawing system, and the characteristics of your models. Through the\nprocess of drawing, what new opportunities arise, how does this new medium allow you to influence the\ndesign? How does your system & machine act to inform the plaster, how does it allow flow, block flow or\nembed gravity into the material?\n\nIn order to make the mold for your project, the most important question is to understand the nature of your\nproject and its grain. What are the necessary elements and details that you need to retain in the mold-\nmaking process? Think about how to make a mold to achieve high resolution, easy pour and simple release.\nA few options for making your molds:\n\nCNC Milling\nIn order to make your mold by using the CNC Milling machine, you will use 2\" foam, which you can cut, glue,\nand assemble, prior to subjecting it to the CNC (i.e. you can have thicker pieces than the 2\" for layers).\nBased on the nature of your project and its grain. Then surface mill the foam and cast in place.\n\nLaser Cutting\nTo laser cut, you will be using thin sheet material that you will then assemble (by using dowels to register\nand make precise structures). You might need to think of a two or three part template for each layer, so that\nyou can ultimately detach the mold and release your cast object.\n\nFabric Casting\nCreate a structure (rigid or wires etc) to hold a network of fabric (latex, spandex, other fabrics etc), then cast\ninside of the fabric to get rigid structures and smooth surfaces\n\nPlaster of Paris\nCreate a structure to hold/tension fabric then paint-on plaster to make rigid surfaces. Then cast within the\nrigid surfaces.\n\nExpanding Foam\nDeposit drops of expanding flexible foam in a systematic process to additively build-up complex 3D\nstructures. Then cast around that.\n\nBuild-up Solid (other method) and Cast Around\nUse any technique of fabrication/lasercutting/paneling or others and build-up the desired solid object, then\ncast around the object with a flexible material to make the negative.\n\nMIT Department of Architecture\n4.112 Architecture Design Fundamentals I, Fall 2012, M/W 2:00-5:00\nInstructor: Skylar Tibbits\n\nSchedule (Note: The schedule may change slightly throughout the project):\nWeek 6\nDeveloping 3D & Solid/Void\nM\nStudio: Introduction to Project 2 & Working Session\nW\nStudio: Pinup First Pass 3D Translation\nWeek 7\nMold Design & 3D Printing\nM\nStudio: Send 3D Prints & Designing the Mold from 3D\nW\nStudio: Fabrication & Building the Mold\nWeek 8\nCasting\nM\nStudio: Assembling the Mold + Casting\nW\nProject 2 Interim Review\nWeek 9\nDrawings - Plans/Sections/Axon\nM\nStudio: Plans/Sections/Axon Development\nW\nStudio: Plans/Sections/Axon Development\nWeek 10\nFinal Review\nM\nFinal Review for Project 2\nFinal Deliverables:\nCast Object(s) + Mold\n3D Printed Object\nSet of Three Coordinated Plans and Sections\nAxonometric Drawing of Solid or Void\nDiagrams of Processing to 3D Translation\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n4.112 Architecture Design Fundamentals I: Nano-Machines\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

However, it is not this\nstrength alone that defines the longevity and durability of the spiderweb. \"It turns\nout that a key property of spider silk that helps make webs robust is something\npreviously considered a weakness: the way it can stretch and soften at first when\npulled, and then stiffen again as the force of the pulling increases.\" For example,\nlet's examine the orb web of the common Garden Spider, or Araneus diadematis.\nIf a bug flies into the web and starts flailing around, attempting to escape, it will\nnot destroy the entire web. Instead, only the strand that was in contact with the\nbug will be broken due to the nonlinear way the web interacts with the force of a\nbug pulling on that single strand.\nTiandra Ray | Spider Web Deformation\nPhoto courtesy of Ben Kreunen on Flickr.\n\nTiandra Ray | Spider Web Deformation\nA diagram and graph depicting what happens when the elasticity of spider silk is tampered with.\nThe way that the spider web reacts to\nan applied force is, in a way, sacrificial.\nThe stress due to the bug pulling on the\nweb is localized, causing only the area\ndirectly affected by the force to be dam\naged. This is due to the versatility of\nthe spider silk in it's nonlinear behavior\n(with nonlinear meaning it changes\nit's behavior over time as the applied\nforce increases). The silk maintains the\nperfect amount of stretchiness with the\nability to stiffen again under stress.

These particular threads\nstretch and soften, allowing the bug to\npull the thread out of the plane of the\nrest of the web. As the bug continues\nto try and pull away from the sticky silk\nthread, it adds additional stress to the\nstick silk strand. Instead of the stress\nbeing transferred to the rest of the web,\nit is transferred to \"tiny protein crystals\nacting as stress points on the targeted\nstrand.\" This single strand stiffens, and\nas the bug continues to pull away the\ncrystals deform and the strand breaks.\nThe web remains intact and functional\nafter this whole endeavor.

One particularly fascinating example is how viruses effi\nciently assemble their outer shell out of thousands of similar protein subunits, also\nknown as the icosahedral viral capsid. The ability for the subunits to spontaneously\ncome together has numerous synthetic applications from the nanoscale and even to\nthe building scale. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of this self assembly\ncan reveal a whole new realm of construction techniques, including the hiearchal\nconstruction process some virus models suggest. By first assembling smaller sub\nunits using primary bonds which then join together using secondary bonds, a virus\ncan assemble its capsid in shorter time than relying on instantaneous generation.\nFundamentals of Viral Construction\nA virus is a biological unit primarily\nconsisting of genetic material enclosed\nin a protein case.
