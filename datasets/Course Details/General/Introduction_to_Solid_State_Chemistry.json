This unique and popular course satisfies MIT's general chemistry degree requirement, with an emphasis on solid-state materials and their application to engineering systems. You'll begin with an exploration of the fundamental relationship between electronic structure, chemical bonding, and atomic order, then proceed to the chemical properties of \"aggregates of molecules,\" including crystals, metals, glasses, semiconductors, solutions and acid-base equilibria, polymers, and biomaterials. Real-world examples are drawn from industrial practice (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing), energy generation and storage (e.g. automobile engines, lithium batteries), emerging technologies (e.g. photonic and biomedical devices), and the environmental impact of chemical processing (e.g. recycling glass, metal, and plastic).\n\nIs This Course for Me?\n\n3.091SC is not \"just a chemistry class\" - it's a **chemistry-**\ncentered\nclass that integrates examples from the world around us, in the arts and humanities, the human stories behind the science, and applications to engineering and emerging technologies.\n\nIf you've taken chemistry classes before (for instance, high school AP Chemistry or another college-level chemistry overview), 3.091SC offers\na fresh look\nat some familiar topics, and includes other topics that fall outside the \"standard\" chemistry curriculum.\n\nWhile it satisfies MIT's\ngraduation requirement for general chemistry\n-- and thus may be the last chemistry class you take -- 3.091SC is also a solid basis for many more years of study in chemistry-intensive subjects.\n\nThe Missing Link to Renewable Energy\n\nView video page\n\nIn this video recorded in March 2012, Professor Sadoway uses his new\nliquid metal battery\nto demonstrate the value of understanding chemistry and his approach to teaching and innovation. (This video is from\nTEDtalksDirector\non YouTube and is not provided under our\nCreative Commons license\n.)\n\nBefore You Begin\n\nPrerequisites\n\nFreshman entering MIT have a wide range of chemistry backgrounds, from no or little exposure in high school, to one or more years of advanced chemistry. This course accommodates that diversity, presuming only a motivation to learn chemistry, basic knowledge of high school physics and math, and problem-solving skills.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUpon successful completion of 3.091SC, students will have accomplished the following\ngeneral\nand\nspecific\nlearning objectives.\n\nGeneral\n\nPredict the\nproperties\nand\ninteractions\nof chemical substances by understanding their\ncomposition\nat the atomic level, making connections to\nstructure\n,\nbonding\n, and\nthermodynamics\nas necessary.\n\nDetermine and apply\nprinciples of materials science\n(specifically microstructure design and selection) to the selection of materials for specific\nengineering applications.\n\nAssess the quality of text and graphics in textbooks and other published sources, and understand the advantages and limitations of\ndifferent models\nproposed to explain each concept.\n\nUnderstand and identify the similarities and differences among important classes of materials including\nglasses\n,\nmetals\n,\npolymers\n,\nbiomaterials\n, and\nsemiconductors.\n\nSpecific\n\nUtilize\nmodels of the atom\nto predict\nbonding\nand\nbehavior\nof atoms.\n\nApply trends in the\nperiodic table\nto predict behavior and properties of the elements.\n\nPredict the behavior of specific elements in\nchemical reactions.\n\nUnderstand how the\nprimary and secondary bonding\nof atoms influences materials properties and behavior.\n\nApply basic rules of\nelectron orbitals\nto predict molecular structure and properties.\n\nSketch the seven\ncrystal systems\nand fourteen\nBravais lattices.\n\nSpecify atomic planes, directions, and families of planes and directions within a given\ncrystal structure\nusing Miller indices.\n\nCorrelate\nX-ray diffraction\ninformation with\ncrystal structure.\n\nCompare and contrast the\nscattering of X-rays, neutrons\nand\nelectrons\nwithin a crystal, and understand when one should use each of these to obtain structural information about a material.\n\nUtilize band theory to describe the operation of modern\nsemiconductor\ndevices.\n\nUse thermodynamics to explain the presence of\npoint defects\nin crystalline solids.\n\nDescribe\npoint, line, planar,\nand\nbulk imperfections\nin crystalline solids, and explain how these imperfections interact.\n\nIdentify the atomic-scale similarities and differences between\namorphous\nand\ncrystalline solids.\n\nDiscuss the structural and physical property differences between\ninorganic glasses\n(oxides, metallic) and\norganic glasses\n(polymers).\n\nApply\nreaction kinetics\nto determine the rate of chemical reactions; understand the factors that influence\nrates of reaction.\n\nUtilize\nbasic biochemistry\nto understand the formation of amino acids, peptides and proteins, lipids and nucleic acids.\n\nApply Fick's laws to predict the\ndiffusion time and depth\nfor systems with various initial and boundary conditions.\n\nUtilize\nbinary phase diagrams\nto identify weight and/or atomic percentages of components, and relative amounts of stable phases in binary and\nunary solutions.\n\nExpectations\n\nHow much time will this class take?\n\nAt MIT, this class meets five times per week for fourteen weeks, with three one-hour lectures by Professor Sadoway, and two one-hour recitation sessions with a graduate teaching assistant. Between attending classes and the reading, homework, and exam preparation, MIT students expect to spend about 150 hours on this course.\n\nCan I work with others?\n\nHomework\n: At MIT, homework for this course is not graded. You should consider working these problems to be an essential part of developing your knowledge. At MIT, working together in groups on is common and even encouraged.\n\nSelf-Assessment\n: The self-assessment and final exam portions of 3.091SC are compiled from in-class examinations. They are intended for you to demonstrate your mastery of the material. You should work these problems on your own, closed-book, using only a calculator, a periodic table and list of fundamental constants (see\nReference Materials\n), and one 8.5\" x 11\" aid sheet containing your choice of formulas and other information.\n\nCourse Topics\n\n3.091SC combines teaching about\nfoundational chemistry concepts\nwith\napplications to particular material forms\n. To guide you through the course, individual class sessions are related to the following foundation and application modules.\n\nFoundations\n\nStructure of the Atom\n- The periodic table, elements and compounds, chemical formulas. Evolution of atomic theory: Thomson & Rutherford, Bohr model of hydrogen, Bohr-Sommerfeld model and multi-electron atoms, atomic spectra, Schrodinger equation. Electron orbitals: Aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rules.\n\nSessions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\nBonding and Molecules\n- Primary bonding: ionic, covalent, metallic. Secondary bonding: dipole-dipole, induced dipole-induced dipole, London dispersion/van der Waals, hydrogen. Shapes of molecules: hybridization, LCAO-MO, VSEPR theory.\n\nSessions 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\n\nReactions and Kinetics\n- Reaction kinetics: rate laws, thermal activation, and the Arrhenius equation. Diffusion: Fick's first and second laws.\n\nSessions 22 (second part), 23, 24\n\nApplications\n\nElectronic Materials\n- Band theory: metals, insulators, and semiconductors. Band gaps, doping, and devices.\n\nSessions 13, 14, 15 (first part)\n\nCrystalline Materials\n- Crystal structure: 7 crystal systems, 14 Bravais lattices, Miller indices. Properties of cubic crystals. X-ray diffraction. Defects: point, line, surface, bulk.\n\nSessions 15 (second part), 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\n\nAmorphous Materials\n- Inorganic glasses: silicates, other oxides, metallics.\n\nSessions 21, 22 (first part)\n\nAqueous Solutions\n- Liquids and solutions: solubility rules, acids, bases, pH.\n\nSessions 25, 26\n\nOrganic Materials\n- Organic compounds: nomenclature, alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics, functional groups.

Each module contains a sequence of several session pages, and ends with a self-assessment page.\n\nOrder of Topics\n\n3.091SC combines teaching about foundational chemistry concepts with applications to particular material forms. This website has been organized for a linear progression through the topics, reflecting the order of lectures as taught at MIT. The initial Structure of the Atom and Bonding and Molecules modules are an essential foundation for the latter portion of the course, and should be studied first. As an independent learner, you could then work through the latter application-oriented modules in the order in which they are presented, or choose a different order which suits your particular interests. For instance, you could study Aqueous Solutions or Organic Materials before the modules on Electronic, Crystalline, and Amorphous Materials. Check the prerequisites listed on each session page to see what prior knowledge is needed, and if needed follow the links to other sessions or modules.\n\nSession Pages\n\nThis class consists of 35 individual sessions. Each session page has the following content:\n\nSession Overview:\nA quick glance at what's in this session and how it fits into the course - keywords, prerequisites, and learning objectives.\n\nReading:\nThe suggested readings from the course notes and textbooks should be completed before watching the video (see note below on Textbooks).\n\nLecture Video:\nEach session has one lecture video, approximately 1 hour long. A PDF file of the slides is provided for reference.\n\nHomework:\nThese problems with solutions are for your benefit, to develop your practical understanding of the material.\n\nFor Further Study:\nThese optional resources may include supplemental reading lists, additional content on historical or cultural aspects mentioned in this session, and related or next-step online content.\n\nSelf-Assessment Pages\n\nAfter you've done all the readings, watched all the lecture videos, and completed the homework in a module, use the self-assessment page to confirm that you understand the material. Each self-assessment page provides several types of problems with solutions, plus helpful videos.\n\nWeekly Quizzes:\nThese short quizzes are representative of the homework in this module, and an indication of the knowledge you should have in preparing for the module exam.\n\nExam Problems:\nThese problems from the Fall 2009 tests verify that you've developed the appropriate depth of understanding, before you move on to the next module.\n\nHelp Session Videos\n: In these informal videos, three teaching assistants from the Fall 2009 class work through their approach to solving the exam problems.\n\n»\nMeet the TAs\n\nSupplemental Exam Problems:\nThese additional exam problems from prior year classes are provided for optional further study.\n\nFinal Exam\n\nAfter completing all nine modules, you'll be prepared for the final exam. Work these problems and check the solutions for an overall assessment of your mastery of the course content.\n\nContent from Various Years\n\nThis OCW Scholar course consolidates materials from several years of 3.091. The core contents (lecture videos, lecture slides, and module self-assessments) are from the Fall 2009 teaching term. The \"archived lecture notes\" used for many session readings were originally written by Prof. August Witt, who taught this course at MIT until 1999. Supplemental exam problems are drawn from the 2007 and 2008 classes, and the final exam is from the Fall 2010 class.\n\nTextbooks and Reference Materials\n\nSuggested Textbooks\n\nThe readings and homework portions of each session combine original content provided on this website and references in commercial textbooks. While the materials on this website are sufficient to complete the course, Professor Sadoway believes that students must also learn how to use textbooks effectively, laying a foundation for future academic work and lifelong scientific literacy.\n\nSuccessful progress in this course will be helped greatly by having access to these books or their equivalents. See the link below for details.\n\nReference Materials\n\nA detailed periodic table of the elements and a table of fundamental physical constants are essential references used throughout the course. These are provided at the following link.\n\n»\nReference materials and a list of suggested textbooks\n\nTechnical Requirements\n\nThis course includes functionality that does not display correctly in Internet Explorer. For best results, we recommend viewing this course with\nFirefox\n,\nSafari\nor\nChrome\n.\n\n«\nNext\n»",

ATOMS\nThe familiar model of an atom is that of a small nucleus composed of protons and\nneutrons surrounded by rapidly moving electrons. Typically, the atomic diameter is on\nthe order of l0-10 m while that of the nucleus is on the order of 10-15 m. Protons and\nneutrons have about the same mass (1.00728 and 1.00867 amu respectively) and each\nis about 1800 times as heavy as an electron. A neutron is electrically neutral, but a\nproton has a positive charge (+1.6 x 10-19 coulomb*) which is exactly the opposite of\nthe negative charge of an electron. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons around\nthe nucleus equals the number of protons in the nucleus.\nThe number of protons in the nucleus (the \"atomic number\", Z) characterizes a\nchemical element. Atoms of a given element all have the same number of protons, yet\nmay have different masses. The atomic mass number of an atom, A, is given by\nA = Z + N, where N is the number of neutrons in the nucleus. Since an element is\ncharacterized solely by Z, it follows that atoms of a given chemical element may have a\nvarying number of neutrons. Subspecies of chemical elements with the same Z but\ndiffering N and A are called isotopes. The atomic weight of an element is the weighted\naverage of the atomic masses of the various naturally occurring isotopes of the\nelement, and the atomic weight scale is based on a value of exactly 12, after the carbon\nisotope that has an atomic mass number of 12.\n2. NUCLEI\nThe nucleus of an atom weighs less than the sum of the weights of its isolated\ncomponent particles. The difference between the actual mass and that of the\n*Generally adopted International Unit System.\n\nLN-1\ncomponents is called the mass defect. The mass defect, Δm, is related to the binding\nenergy within the nucleus, ΔE (in Joules), through Einstein's equation:\nΔE = Δm c2\nwhere c is the velocity of light (in m.s-1) and Δm is the mass defect (in kg). The nuclear\nforces which bind protons and neutrons together are strong, and the binding energy per\nnuclear particle (nucleon) amounts to about 1.4 x 10-12 Joules. The greatest nuclear\nbinding energy is found in nuclei of medium atomic number (such as Fe) where N is\napproximately equal to Z. For nuclei of larger atomic number, such as uranium, N is\nabout equal to 1.5 Z, and the binding energy per nucleon is less. As a consequence of\nthis decreased nuclear stability, some isotopes (of uranium, for example) are unstable.\nThat is, if the uranium isotope, 92U235 (Z = 92, A = 235), is bombarded with neutrons,\nthe following reaction can take place:\n92U235 + n → 39Y94 + 53I140 + 2n\nHere the reaction products are smaller nuclei of increased stability. (In the above\nconvention, subscripts indicate the atomic number and the superscripts the mass\nnumber.) Notice that one incident neutron generates fission products including two\nneutrons - the basis for chain reactions in nuclear reactors and nuclear explosions.\nHeavy nuclei (even light nuclei) which have an unfavorable ratio in the number of\nprotons and neutrons can spontaneously decay by the emission of α particles (helium\nions) or β particles (electrons). These nuclei are referred to as radioactive. The rate at\nwhich the decay of such unstable nuclei takes place varies greatly and is indicated by\nthe half-life of the material. In one half-life period, half of the unstable nuclei will have\nemitted radiation and thus will have changed their character (atomic number). In two\nhalf-life periods, only 1/4 of the nuclei will have survived. In three half-lives, only 1/8 of\nthe original nuclei remain, etc. For example, the half-life of gamma-emitting \"radio\"\ncobalt, 27Co60 (used for X-ray therapy), is 5.3 years, whereas that of radioactive 6C14 is\n5700 years. (Much more radiation is emitted per second by a given number of Co60\natoms than by the same number of C14 atoms.)\n3. EXTRA-NUCLEAR ELECTRONS IN ATOMS\nThe first atomic theory in quantitative agreement with some experimentally determined\nfacts was proposed in 1913 by Niels Bohr. He postulated (for atomic hydrogen) that:\n- The (extra-nuclear) electron can assume only distinct (quantized) energy levels or\nstates.\n- In such energy levels, the electrons in motion will not radiate (loose) energy; on\nchanging energy levels, radiation equivalent to the energy difference between the\n\nLN-1\nlevels is involved.\nErad = E2 - E1 = hν\n- The stable states of the atom involve motion of the electrons in circular orbits.\n- The angular momentum of electrons in orbit (mvr) is an integral number of h/2π\nunits:\nh\nmvr n 2\n-Newtonian mechanics applies to orbiting electrons.\nA pictoral view of the Bohr atomic model visualizes electrons orbiting at a velocity (v) in\nwell-defined spherical orbitals of radius (r) around the nucleus. The angular momentum\nof the orbiting electrons can, as stated above, only assume certain values of n x h/2π\nwhere n (called the principal quantum number) can assume any positive integer value,\ni.e.1, 2, 3, 4, etc. to infinity (fig. 1).\nelectron\norbital radius (r)\n(emission of radiation (return of electron from excited\nto less excited or ground state)\n(absorption of radiation with excitation of\nelectron to excited state - of short lifetime)\nrotating electron in groundstate\nro\nr2\nr3\nE1\nE2\nE3\nn=1\nn=2\nn=3\nnucleus (e+)\nproton (p)\n(v)\n(e)\nexcited electron-state of short\nlifetime\nFigure 1\nThe Hydrogen Atom According to Bohr.\nThe Hydrogen Atom\nAssuming coulombic interaction and the applicability of Newtonian mechanics, the\nfollowing values may be directly obtained for the hydrogen atom:\n\nLN-1\n- The radius of an electron orbit (spherical) in hydrogen is given by:\nn2h2o\nrn\n(n = 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)\nme2\nrn = n2 x constant = n2(0.529 x 10-10) m\nIt can be seen that the smallest electron orbit in hydrogen - the stable orbit - is\ngiven for n = 1 at ro = 0.529 A. It is also seen that r increases with n2 (r = n2ro).\n- The energy of an orbiting electron characterized by the principal quantum number\n(n) is given as:\nEn 1 x me4\n2 1 x constant [Joule]\nn2\n8h2\nn2\no\nThis relationship indicates that electron orbits with increasing principal quantum\nnumber (n) assume decreasing negative values (1/n2) with the limiting value (n →\ninf) being zero. For convenience, it is frequently customary to express electronic\nenergies in terms of wave numbers (ν) with the units of [m-1]. This conversion may\nreadily be made since E = hν. Thus:\n1 1 x me4\n2 [m1]\n\nn2\n8h3co\nUpon substituting numerical values for all the constants, we obtain:\n10973500 1 x 10973500 [m1]\nn2\nn2\n(where n is again the principal quantum number which may assume the values 1, 2,\n3, 4, etc. The value of 10973500 is referred to as the Rydberg constant (R; also RH\nand Rinf) to honor the man who obtained its value from spectroscopic studies prior to\nthe establishment of the Bohr model.)\nThe energy changes associated with electronic transitions and the accompanying\nemission of radiation (or absorption of radiation) may simply be calculated as\n\nn\n\nn2\n\nor\n\nE 10973500\nx hc\nn2\nn2\n\nE\nR\nx hc\nn 2\nn2\n\nE\n2.1798 x 10\n\nJ\nn\n\nn\nE En\nEn1\nAbsorption E En\nEn1\n\nR\n\nLN-1\nfollows:\nEmission\nE\n(En1\nEn2)\nh\nHere n2 is the principal quantum number of the outer orbit and n1 is that of the inner\norbit.

For\nexample, the uranium atom would require 92 electronic orbits and it would have to\nassume a size which is incompatible with the experimental facts. The first modifications\nof the Bohr model were made by Sommerfeld, who introduced additional quantum\nconditions: Taking into account that individual sharp spectral lines split into several lines\n(of slightly differing λ) if light emission takes place in a magnetic field (Zeeman effect),\nthe following picture emerged from the Bohr atom: electronic spherical orbits (shells)\nn1\n\nn=inf\nEinf= 0\nE\n.\nn=5\n5= -R 1/25\nn=4\nE\n.\nPaschen series (I.R.)\n4= -R 1/16\nn=3\nE = -R.\n1/9\nBalmer series (visible)\nn=2\nE2= -R.1/4\nLyman series (ultraviolet)\nn=1\nE1= -R\nΔE ΔE ΔE ΔE\n5 1 4 1 3 1 2 1\n→\n→\n→\n→\nFigure 2 Electron Transitions and Related Optical Spectra in Atomic Hydrogen\nLN-1\nn=5\nn=4\nn=3\nn=2\nn=1\nLyman series of transitions\nterminating at n=1\nBalmer series of transitions\nterminating at n=2\nPaschen series of transitions\nterminating at n=3\nao=0.529 A\nr2=4ao=2.116A\nr3=9ao=4.761A\nr4=16ao=8.464A\n+\n-\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nEn= -R.1/n2\n→\n\nLN-1\nmay have suborbitals (orbits) which are elliptical of varying eccentricity - controlled by\nan additional quantum number, the orbital quantum number (l). The eccentric orbitals\nmay assume only particular spatial orientations controlled by the magnetic number (m),\nin an external magnetic field. The observed magnetic behavior of the elements required\nan additional quantization (Uhlenbeck) - the introduction of the spin quantum number\n(s).\nAccording to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum theory, electrons move about the nucleus\nof an atom in well-defined orbits, each of which is characterized by four numbers, called\nquantum numbers. An electron moving in an orbit close to the nucleus has a larger\n(negative) energy than one in an outer orbit. Energy is therefore necessary to move an\nelectron from an inner to an outer orbit (with smaller negative energy). Conversely,\nenergy is released (as radiation) during the transition of an electron from an outer to an\ninner orbit. The (electromagnetic) radiation released consists of discrete entities or\nquanta, which are called photons. The energy of emitted photons is given by the\ndifference in energy between the two orbits involved and is related to the frequency, ν,\nor the wavelength, λ, of the electromagnetic radiation by:\nEphoton E2 E1 h h(c)\n(c = λν)\nwhere h is called the Planck's constant, E2 and E1 are the energies of the outer and\ninner orbits, respectively, and c is the velocity of light. Through (spectroscopic)\nobservations of the frequencies or wavelengths of radiation emitted by an excited atom\n(atom with an excited electron), the differences of electron energy levels can be\ndetermined. Figure 1 shows such energy levels obtained from measurements of the\nwavelengths of radiation emitted by atomic hydrogen excited electrically in a gas\ndischarge tube.\nTo specify the spatial location and energies of electrons in an atom requires the use of\nfour quantum numbers. The \"principal quantum number\", (n), determines the size of the\nshell in which a particular electron orbits around the nucleus; it also largely determines\nits energy. The value of n is restricted to integral values: n = 1, 2, 3 and so forth. A\nvalue of n = 1 signifies that the electron exists in the lowest energy state and its orbit is\nin the innermost allowed shell, as close to the nucleus as possible. Successively higher\nenergy states are represented by n = 2, 3, etc. It should thus be clear that the principal\nquantum number of the outermost orbiting electron determines, in principle, the size of\na given atom. For convenience, letters are frequently used to characterize the electronic\nshells of n = 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. In letter notation:\nn = 1 = K shell\nn = 2 = L shell\nn = 3 = M shell\netc.\n\nLN-1\nThe second quantum number, (l), is referred to as the \"orbital\" or \"azimuthal quantum\nnumber\". It specifies the angular momentum of orbiting electrons and, to a minor extent,\ntheir energy. \"l\" can only assume integral values ranging from l = 0 to l = (n-1) (where n\nis the principal quantum number). Accordingly, for n = 1 (the K shell), l can only\nassume a value of 0. For n = 2, either l = 0 or l = 1 is possible, etc. For convenience\nagain, letters are used to specify the electronic state (orbit) in a given shell\n(characterized by n) corresponding to the second quantum number:\nl = 0 = s (orbit)\nl = 1 = p (orbit)\nl = 2 = d (orbit)\nl = 3 = f (orbit)\nAn electron with l = 0 is in an s-quantum state (in short, it is an s-electron), one with\nl = 1 is in a p-state, etc. Thus, an electron with a principal quantum number n = 3 and\nan orbital quantum number l = 1 is called a 3p electron (the electron in the M shell is in\na p orbital).\nThe third quantum number, (m), called the \"magnetic quantum number\", controls the\nnumber of allowed spatial orientations (\"degeneracy\") of each orbit characterized by l in\na given shell [characterized by (n)]. (Degenerate states are of identical energy. The\n\"degeneracy\" disappears in the presence of a magnetic field where different spatial\norientation of orbits assume different energy values.) The total number of allowed orbital\norientations for any orbital characterized by l is (2l + 1), corresponding to m values of l,\n(l - 1), (l - 2), ..., 0, -1, -2, ..., -l. An electronic state with l = 0 necessarily has only\nm = 0 and thus has no directional orientation in space; it is a spherical orbit. On the\nother hand, a p-state (l = 1) allows m values of -1, 0, +1. The resulting three possible\norientations are perpendicular to one another (as shown in fig. 4).\nThe first three quantum numbers (n, l and m) define atomic electron orbitals. They are\nrelated respectively to the size, shape, and spatial orientation of the orbital. The fourth\nquantum number, s, (called the \"electron spin quantum number\"), can be interpreted as\ndetermining for an orbiting electron the direction of electronic spin around its own axis.\n\"s\" can assume values of +1/2 (parallel spin) and -1/2 (anti-parallel spin). For notational\npurposes, a positive s is conveniently represented as ↑ and a negative s as ↓.\nWe may now summarize our findings about the electronic states in atoms. Any electron\nin an atom is defined by four quantum numbers, viz.:\n- The principal quantum number (n), which may have any positive integral value\nexcept zero. (In practice, because of the instability of heavy nuclei, atoms\ncontaining electrons with n values greater than 7 are unknown.)\n\nLN-1\n- The orbital or azimuthal quantum number (l), which is an integer and may have any\npositive value less than n, including zero.\n0 l < n\n- The magnetic quantum number (m), which is also an integer and may have any\npositive or negative value equal or less than l, including zero.\n-l m +l\n- The spin quantum number (s) which may only assume one of two values, namely\n+1/2 and -1/2.\ns = 1/2\nAn important law enables us to make use of these quantum rules for the\ncharacterization of electronic states in multi-electron systems: the Pauli Exclusion\nPrinciple. It states that in any atom no two electrons may have the same four quantum\nnumbers. From this principle it follows that each electronic orbital can accommodate at\nmost two electrons differing by their spin quantum number which will be +1/2 for one\nelectron and -1/2 for the other electron. (The Pauli principle is based on the fact that\nthe separate existence of any electron depends upon its non-destruction by\ninterference, i.e. on its wave nature.)\nA further useful fact that generally simplifies understanding electronic structures is that\n(with exceptions stated shortly) the quantum states for electrons follow the rule (Aufbau\nPrinciple) that the lowest m, l and n numbers, consistent with Pauli's exclusion principle,\nare selected first by electrons in multi-electron atoms. (For the spin quantum numbers,\nthe +1/2 value is given priority over the -1/2 value.) Applicability of this rule is restricted\nto systems in which the orbitals, defined by a selected set of quantum numbers with\nlowest possible numerical value, correspond to orbitals of lowest energy since in all\ninstances the lowest energy levels are filled first. The build-up of the electronic states of\nan atom is obtained by placement of the electrons first in the orbitals of lowest energy\n(the aufbau principle or \"construction principle\").\nWave mechanics (introduced by Schrodinger), unlike the quantum theory based on a\nplanetary model, asserts that an electron in an atom cannot be considered as a particle\nhaving an orbit with a definite radius. Instead, there is a probability of an electron being\nat certain spatial positions. Hence, the location of an electron is best described in terms\nof its probability density distribution, which is sometimes called an electron cloud. The\nspatial symmetry of the probability distribution depends upon the electronic state. The\nelectron cloud is spherically symmetric for s-electrons, but more complicated for\nelectrons in a p-state. Examples of these distributions are shown in fig. 3 for 1s and 2p\nelectrons.\n\nLN-1\nFigure 3\nConclusions on Electron Orbital Shapes based on\nWave Mechanics:\n99% contour of 1s electron orbital\n99% contour of 2s electron orbital\nz\nz\ny\nx\n2py orbital\ny\nx\nz\n2p z orbital\ny\n2px orbital\nx\n\nLN-1\n4. ENERGY LEVELS AND THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE\nConsider the atom of an element containing one extra-nuclear electron: hydrogen; for\nelectro-neutrality the charge on the nucleus must be +1. This orbiting electron (in the\nground state - the lowest possible, most stable state) will have the lowest available\nquantum numbers in n, l and m. That is, n = 1; hence l = 0 and m = 0; also, s = +1/2.\nIn the two-electron atom helium, one electron will have the same quantum numbers as\nthe electron in hydrogen and the other electron will have quantum numbers n = 1, l = 0,\nm = 0 and s = -1/2. The element of atomic number 3 (lithium) will have two electrons\nwith the same quantum numbers as the helium electrons, plus one electron with the\nquantum numbers n = 2, l = 0, m = 0, s = +1/2. [Note that n must be 2 for the third\nelectron since states such as (n = 1, l = 1) or (n = 1, l = 0, m = 1) or (n= 1, l = 0, m = -1)\nare not allowed. Similarly, the quantum numbers for the additional electron in beryllium\n(atomic number 4) are n = 2, l = 0, m = 0, s = -1/2. The next electron for boron (atomic\nnumber 5) has the values n = 2, l = 1, m = -1, s = +1/2, and so on.\nIn applying the aufbau principle to the orbital filling with increasing atomic number we\nhave thus far inferred the tendency of the energies of electrons to follow in the same\norder as the principal quantum numbers; that is, successive electron shells are filled\nwith increasing Z. This concept does not hold in all instances. For example, electrons\nwith the quantum numbers n = 3, l = 2 (and various m values) are of higher energy than\nthose with n = 4, l = 0. Other inversions occur with n = 4 and higher. These apparent\nirregularities in the aufbau principle, the result of an energetic overlap of orbitals in\nsuccessive shells, lead to partial shell fillings and the appearance of groups of so-called\ntransition elements. The groups are characterized (with minor exceptions) by identical\noutermost electron shell configurations and therefore do not exhibit, with increasing\natomic number, the (expected) change in properties observed on regular shell filling for\nelements 2-18. (In the transition elements, with increasing atomic number the electrons\nare accommodated in lower lying shells which remained empty because of the above\nmentioned energy overlap of their orbitals.) The energy levels of the various orbitals in\nshells with increasing n are schematically indicated in fig. 4.\nAnother factor in the application of the aufbau principle is Hund's Rule which states that\nin atoms the electrons tend at first to fill up given orbitals (m levels) singly (with\nunpaired spins and spin quantum number equal to +1/2). Only after all m levels\nassociated with a particular l value in a given shell have been used for single-electron\noccupation does doubling of electrons into m levels occur. Thus the extra electron for\ncarbon (atomic number 6) has the quantum numbers n = 2, l = 1, m = 0, s = +1/2 rather\nthan n = 2, l = 1, m = -1, s = -1/2. Both the effects of energy inversion and Hund's rule\nare very apparent when considering the electronic configuration of the elements Z = 18,\n19, 20 and 21.\n\nLN-1\nEnergy\nd\nf\ns\np\nd\ns\nd\ns\np\ns\np\np\ns\ns\nn\nRelative energies of the orbitals in neutral, many-electron atoms.

The more informative\nway is a code written as follows: The principal quantum number is given first, followed\nby the conventional letter which designates the azimuthal (orbital) quantum number\nand, in a superscript, the number of electrons with that azimuthal quantum number. The\ncode for the electronic ground state in hydrogen, therefore, is 1s1, for helium 1s2,\nlithium 1s22s1, beryllium 1s22s2, boron 1s22s22p1, etc. (See fig. 5 for example.) You will\nnote that the magnetic quantum number has not been specified, but this can be done\nwhen required by writing px when m = -1, py when m = +1 and pz when m = 0. Similar\ncodes exist for the d and f levels. Usually such subscripts are not specified and in that\ncase a consideration of Hund's rule will not be required.\nAn important fact to remember is that the number of electrons in any s, p, d or f level is\nlimited: There are, as you know, a maximum of two electrons in any level with spin\nnumbers +1/2 and -1/2. For the p levels, l is one and, therefore, three m values (-1, 0,\n+1) are permitted, each with two electrons of spin number +1/2 and -1/2, resulting in a\nmaximum of six p electrons in any p orbital system. The reader should confirm that ten\nelectrons are the maximum in a d system of orbitals and 14 in an f system of orbitals.\n5. IONIZATION POTENTIAL\nElectrons may be removed from isolated atoms by bombardment with other electrons\nand by heat, for examples. The work (energy) required to remove the most weakly\nbound (outermost) electron from an isolated atom is known as the \"ionization energy\".\nThis energy is sometimes listed in units of Joules. More often ionization energies are\ngiven in terms of the \"ionization potential\". The ionization potential is the potential (V)\nthat will accelerate an electron at rest so that it acquires a kinetic energy, sufficient to\nextract the outermost (most loosely bound) electron from an atom. This potential is\n13.595 Volt (as listed in the PT) for the ionization of a hydrogen atom. You can also say\nthe electron is bound to the proton by an (negative) energy equivalent to the energy of\nan electron accelerated by a potential of 13.595 Volt. [If you make a dimensional\nanalysis, you will recognize that charge (e) times potential (V) has the dimensions of\nenergy (kg.m2.sec-2) and 1 electron Volt (1eV) corresponds to 1.6 x 10-19 Joules.]\n(Note that the first ionization energies are given as first ionization potentials (V) in the\nPeriodic Table of the Elements; see also the 3.091 courseware menu.)\nIt is significant that inert or noble gases have some of the highest ionization potentials.\nThis reflects the fact that these elements have just enough electrons to completely fill a\nshell or a subshell which form stable configurations. On the other hand, the ionization\npotentials of alkali metal atoms (Li, Ni, etc.) are low - the lowest, that of Cs, is only\n3.89 eV. The reason for this is that alkali metal atoms have one outer s-electron beyond\nthe stable electronic structure of an inert gas atom. Consequently this single electron in\n\nLN-1\nFigure 5\nAtomic Electron Affinities (EA)\nOrbital\nOrbital\nEA,\nelectronic\nelectronic\nelectron\nconfiguration\nAtom\nconfiguration\nvolts\nof anion\nH\n1s1\n\n0.756\n(He)\nF\n(He) 2s22p5\n3.45\n(Ne)\nCl\n(Ne) 3s23p5\n3.61\n(Ar)\nBr\n(Ar) 4s2 3d104p5\n3.36\n(Kr)\nI\n(Kr) 5s24d105p5\n3.06\n(Xe)\nO\n(He) 2s22p4\n1.47\n(He)2s22p5\nS\n(Ne) 3s23p4\n2.07\n(Ne)3s23p5\nSe\n(Ar) 4s23d104p4\n(1.7)\n(Ar)4s23d104p5\nTe\n(Kr) 5s24d105p4\n(2.2)\n(Kr)5s24d105p5\nN\n(He) 2s22p3\n(-0.1)\n(He)2s22p4\nP\n(Ne) 3s23p3\n(0.78)\n(Ne)3s22p4\nAs\n(Ar) 4s23d104p3\n(0.6)\n(Ar)4s23d104p4\nradio\nwaves\nmicro\nwaves\nvisible\nInfrared\nlight\nUltraviolet\nx rays\nγ rays\n0.1\n10-2 10-3 10-4 10-5 10-6 10-7 10-8 10-9\nwavelength (λ) in cm\nultra\nviolet\nviolet\nblue\ngreen\nyellow\norange\nred\nnear infrared\nwavelength (nm)\nThe visible spectrum\n\nLN-1\nthe outermost new shell can be removed relatively easily.

ELECTRON AFFINITY\nAs we shall see later, the tendency of some atoms to accept, as well as to lose,\nelectrons is important in determining how atoms combine with each other. Whereas\nremoval of an electron always requires the expenditure of energy, acceptance of one\nextra electron by an atom generally is accompanied by the release of energy. The\namount of energy released on acquisition of an electron is called the electron affinity (or\n\"first electron affinity\"). The elements on the left of the periodic table (metals) and the\ninert gases on the outer right have low electron affinities, whereas the non-metals have\nhigher ones. The particularly high electron affinities of halogen atoms (F, Cl, etc.) may\nbe attributed to the fact that these elements all lack one electron which would provide\nthe stable electronic structure of an inert gas. By acquiring an additional electron, they\nincrease their stability since the additional electron goes into the orbital lacking one\nelectron and thus results in a stable, s2p6, octet configuration. (See fig. 5.)\n7. ATOMIC SIZE\nThe size, or volume, of an isolated atom is difficult to define explicitly since, in the\nelectron cloud model of the atom, the probability density distribution theoretically\nreaches zero only at infinity. Nevertheless, the electron density falls off so rapidly at a\nshort distance from the nucleus that some approximation of size can be made. In the\nhydrogen atom, for example, the electron density is very nearly zero at a distance of\n1.2 A (1.2 x 10-10 m) from the nucleus. The problem of defining atomic size is simplified\nin molecules and solids in that rather precise dimensions can be determined from\ninteratomic distances which can be measured by diffraction techniques. Thus, in the H2\nmolecule the atoms are only 0.72 A apart, as determined from the distance between the\nnuclei. In this case the radius of the hydrogen atoms is taken to be 0.37 A, even though\nthe size of the H2 molecule is considerably more than four times this value.\n\nLN-1\nIt should be apparent that the atomic radius depends upon whether an atom is isolated\nor combined with other atoms. The radius of an isolated atom is called the van der\nWaals radius, that of a bound atom in a molecule is the covalent radius, and that of a\nbound atom in a metal is the metallic radius.

This\ncondition is never met in condensed phases (i.e., liquids and solids); it is only\nencountered in high vacua where atoms move over long distances without mutual\ninteraction. Under normal conditions, particularly in the mentioned condensed phases,\natoms are separated over distances controlled, in essence, by the dimension of their\nrespective outermost occupied electronic orbitals. Whenever the outer electron shells of\ntwo or more atoms come in contact with each other (overlap to any extent), the\npotential for interaction (reaction) exists. Spontaneous reaction (consisting of a\nrearrangement of the electronic orbitals and/or actual transfer of electrons from one\natom to another) will take place whenever such a rearrangement results in a lower\nenergy configuration. This means that the driving force for mutual interaction and\nrearrangement of electronic configurations is in most instances (but not always)\nmanifested through the release of heat (a form of energy) to the environment. [Typical\ncase: Mg + 1/2 O2 → Reaction Product (MgO) + (light + heat) i.e. energy.] Since the\nsame amount of energy must be supplied to the system if the original state - i.e.,\n\nLN-2\nseparation of the species - is to be reestablished, the reaction partners are \"bonded\ntogether\" by comparable energies. The \"strength\" of the bonds can obviously vary from\nsystem to system with the nature of the electronic rearrangement.\nEven the inert gases, particularly the heavier ones like xenon, are capable of forming\nassociations with other atoms. Sometimes we find that two atoms assume a more\nstable state by sharing electrons; at other times, an atom may transfer electrons to\nanother atom in order to achieve a greater stability. In still other instances, the\nrearrangement may simply be an orbital distortion or an internal charge redistribution.\nIn either event the mutual benefit that accrues is the formation of what is commonly\ncalled a chemical bond. Through these bonds atoms combine with each other to form\nvery different kinds of particles referred to as molecules and ions.\n1.\nNATURE OF CHEMICAL BONDS\nIn order for a chemical bond to be formed between two atoms, there must be a net\ndecrease in the energy of the system (the two atoms): the ions or molecules produced\nby electronic rearrangements must be in a lower energy state than the atoms were prior\nto interaction, prior to bond formation.\nSince atoms of each of the elements have different electronic structures, the variety of\npossible chemical bonds (differing from each other in at least some small way) is\nconsiderable and is even further increased by the effects of neighboring atoms on the\nbond under consideration. The modes of bond formation can be categorized into two\nbasic types, each representing a type of bonding. The bonding types are called\nelectrovalent (or ionic) bonding and covalent bonding. Electrovalent bonding arises\nfrom complete transfer of one or more electrons from one atom to another; covalent\nbonding arises from the sharing of two or more electrons between atoms. Since these\nmodels represent the limiting cases, we can anticipate that most real bonds will fall\n\nLN-2\nbetween these two extremes. (Two additional types of bonding, metallic bonding and\nVan der Waals bonding, will be discussed later.)\nBefore discussing these models in detail it is appropriate to consider the relationships\nbetween the electronic structures of atoms and their chemical reactivity. The inert gases\n(Group VIII) are the most stable elements with regard to bond formation, i.e. toward\nelectronic rearrangements. It is therefore useful to examine the reasons for their\nstability. Inert gases all have electronic structures consisting of filled subshells. For all\nbut helium the outer (or valence) shell contains eight electrons, with filled s and p\nsublevels (ns2p6). The electronic structure of helium is 1s2, which is equivalent to the\nstructure of the other inert gases since there is no 1p sublevel. Inert gases have high\nionization energies because each electron in the sublevel of highest energy is poorly\nscreened from the nucleus by other electrons in its same sublevel. Each electron \"sees\"\nrelatively high positive charge on the nucleus, and a large amount of energy is required\nto remove it from the atom. Inert gases have very low electron affinity because any\nadded electron must enter a significantly higher energy level. We find, therefore, that\nthe electronic structures of inert gases are particularly resistant to changes by either\nloss or gain of electrons and, further, that atoms of other elements with fewer or more\nelectrons than inert gas configuration tend to gain or lose electrons, respectively, to\nachieve such inert gas structure.\n2.\nELECTROVALENT (IONIC) BONDING\nAn electrovalent bond is formed by the transfer of one or more electrons from one atom\nto another. Consider first atoms that have electronic structures differing from an inert\ngas structure by only a few, (1, 2 or 3) electrons. These include the representative\nelements of Groups I, II and III in the Periodic Table, which have respectively 1, 2 and 3\nelectrons more than a neighboring inert gas, and the representative elements of\n\nLN-2\nGroups V, VI and VII, which have respectively 3, 2 and 1 electrons less than a\nneighboring inert gas (fig. 1).\nValence shell\nwith stable\nns1\nns2p5\nOctet Configuration\nns2p6\nFig.1 Stable and Unstable Valence Shell Configurations.\nThe elements of Groups I, II and III can form the electronic structure of an inert gas by\nlosing their outer 1, 2 and 3 (valence) electrons. (The resulting species are positively\ncharged ions.)\nIn a similar electron transfer which, however, involves the acquisition of electrons in the\nouter valence levels, elements of Groups V, VI and VII form an inert gas electronic\nstructure (by formation of negatively charged ions).\nIt is through the electron transfer between an electron-losing element and an\nelectron-gaining element that compounds are formed which involve electrostatic\nattraction (electrovalent bonds) of oppositely charged species called ions.\nUnstable\nValence shell\nconfigurations\n-\n→ [Na] + + [F]\n++\n-\n→ [Mg]\n+ 2[F]\n(In the notation [Na-], the dot indicates the outermost electron which is in excess of the\nrare gas configuration. It is referred to as a valence electron.)\nNa\n1e -\n+ F\n\nMg\n2e -\n+ 2F\n\nLN-2\nElements immediately following the inert gases (in the horizontal columns of the\nPeriodic Table) lose electrons, and those immediately preceding the inert gases gain\nelectrons on interaction. The resulting compounds are called electrovalent; the valence\nnumber (charge on the ion) of a particular element when it forms an electrovalent\ncompound is given by the number of electrons lost or gained in changing from the\natomic to the ionic state.\nThe stoichiometric formula of an electrovalent compound reflects the ratio (usually very\nsimple) of positive to negative ions that gives a neutral aggregate. Hence, the ions Na+\nand F- form a compound whose formula is NaF because these ions are singly charged\nand are present in the compound in a one-to-one ratio. Magnesium nitride, composed\nof Mg2+ and N3-, has the formula Mg3N2 because this composition represents\nelectroneutrality.\nThe electrovalent bond is the result of electrostatic attraction between ions of opposite\ncharge. This attractive force accounts for the stability of these compounds, typified by\nNaF, LiCl, CaO, and KCl. The ions individually possess the electronic structures of\nneighboring inert gases; their residual charge arises from an imbalance in the number\nof electrons and protons in their structures. Isolated ions and simple isolated pairs of\nions, as represented by the formula NaCl, exist only in the gaseous state. Their\nelectrostatic forces are active in all directions; they attract oppositely charged species\nand thus can form regular arrays, resulting in ordered lattice structures, i.e. the solid\nstate (fig. 2). Even in the liquid state and in solutions (where disruptive thermal forces\nreach values close to that of the attractive electrostatic bonding forces) attraction\nbetween ions and with other species remains effective.\n\nLN-2\nIonic interactions are\nThe resulting low energy configuration:\nomni-directional and\nAn ordered 3-dimensional network,\nnon-saturated\na \"crystalline\" solid.\nFigure 2 Formation of a crystalline, ordered body (a SOLID), a direct\nconsequence of ion interaction in conjunction with energy minimization..\nEnergetics of Ionic Bonding\nIonic bonding is the simplest type of chemical bonding to visualize, since it is totally (or\nalmost totally) electrostatic in nature. The principle of the energetics of ionic bond\nformation is realized when considering the formation of NaCl (our common salt) from its\nconstituents Na (metal) and Cl2 (chlorine gas). Formally, this reaction is:\nNa (s) + 1/2 Cl2 (g) → NaCl (s)\nΔH = -414 kJ/mol\nThe equation as written indicates that 1 mole sodium reacts with 1/2 mole chlorine (Cl2)\nunder formation of 1 mole (ionically bonded) sodium chloride; this reaction is\naccompanied by the release (-) of 414 kJ of energy (ΔH), referred to as the heat of\nreaction. From earlier considerations it is clear that electronic rearrangement (reaction\nor bond formation) takes place because the resulting solid product (NaCl) is at a lower\nenergy state than the sum total of the energies of the original components.\n\nLN-2\nNa + Cl\n1e-\nThe energetics associated with ionic bond formation may be determined quantitatively\nby considering the energy changes associated with the individual steps leading from\nthe starting materials to the final product (Haber-Born cycle).\nThe bond formation in NaCl may be formally presented as an electron-transfer reaction:\n→\nNa + + Cl -\nThe reactions involved in this process which result in the formation of 1 mole of solid\nsalt are:\n(1)\nIonization of Na:\nNa (gas) → Na+ + 1e\n(E.I. = +497 kJ/mole)\nThe energy change associated with this step, energy of ionization (E.I.), is\n+497 kJ/mole.\n(2)\nAcquisition of one electron by Cl:\nCl (gas) + 1e → Cl-\n(E.A. = -364 kJ/mole)\nThe energy change associated with this step, electron affinity (E.A.), is\n-364 kJ/mole. The minus sign reflects an energy release, a lowering of the energy\nstate associated with the achievement of stable rare gas configuration by chlorine.\nSo far, the energy balance appears positive (ΔE = +133 kJ); this means the reaction is\nnot favored since the final products are at a higher energy state than the starting\nproducts. However, there are additional steps involved since:\n(3) Vaporization of Na:\nNa (metal) → Na (gas)\n(ΔHV = +109 kJ/mole)\nThe energy required to transform Na (metal) into Na (gas), the latent heat of\nvaporization (ΔHV), is 109 kJ/mole (now reaction appears even less favorable).\n\nLN-2\n(4) Dissociation of Cl:\nCl2 → 2Cl\n(E.D. = +242 kJ)\nThe energy associated with breaking up the (stable) chlorine molecule into two\nreactive chlorine atoms, dissociation energy (E.D.), is +242 kJ/mole. (Since the\nformation of one mole NaCl involves only 1 mole Cl, and since 2 moles are formed\nfrom one mole Cl2, the energy required in this step is 1/2 E.D., or 121 kJ.)\nThe total energy change associated with reactions (1) through (4), ΔHT = +364 kJ This\nindicates that one or more basic reactions which lead to an overall decrease in energy\nare still unconsidered.\n(5)\nUnconsidered as yet is the coulombic attraction of the reaction products which are\nof opposite charge and an energy term associated with the formation of the \"solid\nstate\" product, NaCl. The two ionic species, originally at zero energy (infinite\ndistance of separation), attract each other with an accompanying energy change\n(decrease).\nThe energetics associated with the approach of the reaction partners (fig. 3) is best\nconsidered by fixing the position of one, for example Na+, and letting the other (Cl-)\napproach: as Cl- approaches Na+, E decreases according to Coulomb's law with\ne2/4πεor. With the approach of the two oppositely charged ions, the outermost\nelectronic shells will come into contact and a repulsive force will become active as the\nshells interpenetrate. The repulsive force (Erep) increases with +b/r12 and thus is only\nactive in the immediate vicinity of the sodium ion, but at that stage increases rapidly.\nThe two ions at close proximity are under the influence of both attractive and repulsive\nforces and will assume a distance of separation at which the two forces balance each\nother - a distance which is referred to as the equilibrium separation (ro) and which\n\nLN-2\nE coul\n(+)\n(-)\n(r)\n+\nEo\nEattr = - e2/4πεοr\nErep = b/rn\nAnion\ncation\nro\nEtotal = Eattr + Erep\nequilibrium distance of separation (ro)\nat Energy minimum (Bond energy)\n\"Bond\nEnergy\"\nFigure 3 Energetics of ionic bonding.\ncorresponds to the energy minimum for the NaCl molecules:\nEcoul\ne2\noro\nr\nb\no\nwhere e = electronic charge, εo = permittivity of free space (8.85 x 10-12 F/m) and (b) is\na constant. (ro for gaseous molecules may be obtained from physical measurements.)\nIf the presently considered coulombic (attractive) energy term is taken into\nconsideration as reaction (5), it will decrease the overall positive energy change, ΔHT; it\nwill, however, not make it change sign from (+) to (-). Thus, NaCl molecules in gaseous\nform are not the final reaction product; nor would reaction occur if ΔHT remained\npositive.\nConsidering an ionically bonded, gaseous Na+Cl- molecule, it is clear that its\nelectrostatic forces (+) and (-) are not saturated - they remain active in all possible\ndirections. This means that Cl- will attract Na+ ions from other directions as will the Na+\n\nLN-2\natoms attract additional Cl- ions. The result of these attractive forces in all directions is\nthe formation of a \"giant size\" ionic body - a \"solid\" body of macroscopic dimensions.\nFrom the preceding it is recognized that the minimum energy configuration is given by a\nbody in which Na+ and Cl- are arranged with extreme periodicity and order since any\nion located outside of its \"equilibrium position\" will be in a \"higher energy configuration\";\nsuch an ordered body is referred to as a crystalline solid, or frequently just called a\nsolid (fig. 2).\nThe total energy change associated with the formation of one mole of crystalline ionic\nsolid from its ionic constituents is given as:\n\nwhere M = 1.747 (\"Madelung\" constant for NaCl, reflecting multiple interactions for the\nparticular geometric arrangement of ions in the solid), NA = Avogadro's number, Q =\nnumber of charges per ion (1 for Na+ and Cl-), ro= equilibrium distance of separation of\nions, and n = repulsive exponent (n = 12 for NaCl).\n[The relationship for the crystal energy (ΔEcryst) is readily obtained from equilibrium\nenergy considerations:\ne2\nb\nEcoul\n4r\n4rn\nAt equilibrium distance of ion separation (ro), (dE/dr) = 0.

In most instances, however, the reaction energy (ΔH) is determined\nexperimentally in a calorimeter and the Haber-Born cycle is used to obtain the value of\nΔEcryst or E.A., which are both extremely hard to come by.\n\nLN-2\nConclusions: A primary drive for atomic interactions leading to \"bonding\" is the\nachievement of valence shell octets which exhibit a high degree of stability. If atoms on\nthe left and right side of the Periodic Table interact, i.e. atoms with a large difference in\nelectron affinity (ΔE.A.), stabilization is achieved by electron octet formation through\ncharge transfer. The reaction products exhibit opposite charges ( cations, anions)\nand are subject to Coulombic attraction - ionic bonds are formed. Since the\nelectrostatic forces are non-directional and non-saturated, energy minimization will\nresult in the formation of macroscopic bodies that are highly ordered on the atomic\nscale, crystalline ionic solids. Ionic solids have mostly predictable, basic properties:\n- atomic arrangements are a function of the ion size ratio, the charge ratio of ions,\nand their electronic structure;\n- electrical and thermal conductivities are expected to be low because the high\nstability of the octets formed results in bound electrons which do not contribute to\nconduction (there is a large \"energy gap\" to be crossed for electrons to move\ninto a higher energy state);\n- optically, ionic solids are mostly transparent, or translucent, reflecting octet\nstability of the electrons and macro- or micro-crystallinity;\n- melting points are high, increasing with the electronic charges on the cations and\nanions;\n- ionic solids are normally hard and brittle.\n3.\nCOVALENT BONDING\nWave Mechanical Concepts and Conclusions\nIn 1924 L. DeBroglie advanced the hypothesis that all matter in motion possesses wave\nproperties and can be attributed a particle wavelength\nλP = h/mv\nwhere h is the Planck constant, m is the mass of the matter and v is its velocity.\n\nLN-2\nThe credibility of this hypothesis was established by Davisson and Germer in 1927\nwhen they demonstrated that electrons (like electromagnetic radiation) are diffracted by\ncrystal lattices. An important consequence of the dual nature of matter (it exhibits both\nparticle and wave properties) is the uncertainty principle established in 1927 by\nW. Heisenberg. It states that it is impossible to simultaneously know with certainty both\nthe momentum and position of a moving particle:\n\nWe can paraphrase the uncertainty principle in the following manner: If the energy of a\nparticle is known (measured) with high precision, its location is associated with a high\ndegree of uncertainty.\nIf electrons occupied simple orbits (as postulated by Bohr-Sommerfeld), their\nmomentum and position could be determined exactly at any moment - in violation of\nthe uncertainty principle. According to Heisenberg, if the energy of an electron is\nspecified with precision (sharpness of spectral lines), its location can only be specified\nin terms of the probability of finding this electron in a certain location (volume\nelement). These arguments give rise to the concepts of probability density and electron\ncloud which are inherent to the wave-mechanical electron concept emanating from the\nsolutions of Schrodinger's wave equation which relates the energy of an orbiting\nelectron to its wave properties. When solving exactly the Schrodinger wave equation for\nan electron in a hydrogen atom, a quantization results according to which electrons can\nonly assume certain energies which are in quantitative agreement with those obtained\nfrom the Bohr theory.\nIn comparison to the Bohr theory, significant differences are observed for the orbital\nquantization (orbital quantum number l) which specifies the orbital shape. For n = 1,\nl = 0 (1s orbital), wave mechanics predicts a spherical electron density distribution with\na maximum probability density (ψ2) at a distance of 0.529 A (ao) from the nucleus. For\n\nLN-2\nl = 1 (p orbitals), however, it is found that the orbitals (three) form lobes aligned with\nrectangular coordinates (see LN-1, fig. 3). For l = 2 (d orbitals), five complex orbital\nconfigurations are obtained.\nPrevious considerations suggest that all elements attempt to assume a stable octet\nconfiguration with eight electrons in the valence shell. (For hydrogen, with only one\nshell occupied, the stable configuration consists of two electrons in the K shell - which\nis the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated.) Stable octet\nformation is possible through electron transfer (and ionic bond formation) when, for\nexample, elements in columns IA, IIA and IIIA react with elements in columns VA, VIA\nand VIIA, respectively. In these instances, the reaction partners exhibit rather\npronounced differences in electron affinity and upon reaction one assumes octet\nconfiguration by losing one or more electrons while the other does so by acquiring the\nmissing number of electrons.\nThis mechanism is clearly not possible if H reacts with H to form an H2 molecule where\ntwo atoms are bonded together. The same argument holds for the formation of N2, Cl2\nand O2 molecules. Inert gas configuration (octet configuration) in such elements is\nachieved by a mechanism called orbital sharing and the resulting bond is called\ncovalent, or electron-pair bond.\nA covalent bond is somewhat more difficult to visualize than an ionic or electrovalent\nbond because it involves the sharing of a pair of electrons between atoms. The stability\nof this bond can be attributed to the complex mutual attraction of two positively\ncharged nuclei by the shared pair of electrons. In principle, the bond can be understood\nif it is recognized that both electrons in the bonding orbital spend more time between\nthe two nuclei than around them and thus must exercise attractive forces which\nconstitute the bond. In this arrangement it is clear that each electron, regardless of its\nsource, exerts an attractive force on each of the \"bonded\" nuclei. The pair of electrons\n\nLN-2\nin a covalent bond is unique to the extent that the Pauli exclusion principle precludes\nthe presence of additional electrons in the same orbital. Furthermore, the pairing\nphenomenon neutralizes the separate electronic spins of the single electrons, and the\nresulting electron pair with its zero spin momentum interacts less strongly with its\nsurroundings than do two independent electrons. [Covalent bonds are conveniently\nsymbolized through the dot notation, introduced first by Lewis (fig. 4).]\nLEWIS NOTATION:\nIn LEWIS notation the covalent molecular bond is indicated as a BAR\nor as two DOTS (standing for the paired electrons)\nH-H or H: H\nH\n:\n:\n: Cl :Cl\n:\n:\n: or Cl Cl or Cl Cl;\nCH4 =\nH C H\nH\nFormal valence shell octet stabilization can be achieved by electron sharing,\nwhereby one electron from each reaction partner share - spin paired - the\nmolecular bonding orbital.\nFigure 4 Lewis notation\nQuantum mechanics makes it possible to rigorously describe these bonds for very\nsimple cases such as the hydrogen molecule, which is composed of two protons and\ntwo electrons. It can thus be shown that the potential energy for the system reaches a\nminimum for a certain equilibrium distance between the nuclei, with increased electron\ndensity between the nuclei. At shorter distances between the nuclei repulsive forces\nare found to increase very rapidly.\nIn the hydrogen molecule (H2), the two hydrogen atoms are effectively linked together\nby one molecular electron orbital, termed a σ orbital, which comprises both atoms and\ncontains two electrons. (fig. 5) Each of these two electrons can be considered to have\noriginated from one of the two atoms - they were originally both 1s electrons with the\nsame spin value (s = +1/2).

This spin-pairing process\nresults in a considerable release of energy and thus contributes significantly to the\nstability (strength) of the covalent bond formed. It is interesting that according to\nNewtonian mechanics, no stable configuration can arise from the placement of two\nelectrons into the same region (orbit) - wave mechanics (see below), however, predicts\nincreased stability from such configurations. (Similar spin-pairing occurs in the filling of\natomic orbitals.) In the molecular case, spin-pairing has the consequence that both the\nprobability distributions (ψ2) and spatial distribution of electrons are such that maximum\noverlap of orbitals of combining atoms occurs.\nThe bond formed in hydrogen is a single bond, containing two electrons with paired\nspins. This formulation predicts that there will be a fixed internuclear separation which,\nfor the hydrogen molecule, has the value of 0.74 A. [σ bonds are formed not only by s\norbital overlap, but also by p-s and p-p orbital overlap as well as by the overlap of s or p\norbitals with hybridized orbitals; to be discussed below (see fig. 5).]\n\nLN-2\nIt is important to recognize that octet stabilization by electron orbital sharing results in\nbond properties which differ fundamentally from those encountered in ionic\n(electrovalent) bonding: with the formation of the covalent bond between the hydrogen\natoms (H2 molecule formation) the bond forming capabilities of the two hydrogen atoms\nare saturated; the final product is a distinct molecule (H2) rather than a giant-sized solid\nbody which is obtained as the final product with ionic bond formation. Covalent solid\nbodies, however, also do exist: they are formed if the elements involved have the\ncapability of forming more than one bond. For example, carbon will form four covalent\nbonds in tetrahedral configuration - the result is diamond, a covalently bonded, three\ndimensional network.\nDiatomic Molecules Involving Dissimilar Atoms\nConsider the compound hydrogen chloride (in the gaseous, liquid or solid state). This\ncompound is not ionic (because the energy state on complete ionization would be\nhigher. Instead, bonding between hydrogen and chlorine atoms is accomplished by the\nsharing of electrons in a molecular orbital, thus forming a single covalent bond (fig. 6).\n-\n-\ns\np\nH\nCl\nasymmetric\ncharge distribution\npy\npz\nFigure 6\npolar covalency with\nasymmetric electron distribution\npx\nsimplified\nH\nCl\npresentation\nδ + δ\nH\nCl\n\nLN-2\nThe electrons involved are the 1s electron of the hydrogen atom and the unpaired 3pz\nelectron of the chlorine atom. After spin-pairing, a typical σ bond results in which each\natom attains a noble gas structure: in HCl the hydrogen atom is \"involved\" with two\nelectrons, as in helium, and the chlorine atom with 18 electrons, as in argon. The other\n(inner) electrons of chlorine do not participate in the bonding; they are termed\nnon-bonding.\nAccording to the above considerations, the bonding of HCl may be taken as very similar\nto that of H2. However, in the hydrogen molecule the electrons participating in the σ\nbond formation do not favor the proximity of either of the hydrogen nuclei - instead, they\nare equally shared. On the other hand, a preference for one nucleus (chlorine) is shown\nby the electrons of the σ bond in hydrogen chloride. This is because electrons, for\nenergetic reasons, favor the environment of the more electronegative atom; in\nhydrogen chloride this is the chlorine atom and, consequently, the σ bond electrons\nspend more time in the vicinity of the chlorine atom. This situation results in the chlorine\nend of the molecule being fractionally negatively charged (δ-) and the hydrogen end\nbeing fractionally positively charged (δ+). We denote such an internal charge\nredistribution by the symbolism Hδ+ - Clδ-, where the δ sign indicates a partial electronic\ncharge; the bond is said to be polar. (The hydrogen molecule does not a priori exhibit\nsuch an \"asymmetric charge distribution\"; it may, however, acquire a temporary\npolarization.) Molecules with asymmetric electronic charge distribution have a\npermanent dipole moment, the value of which is given by the product of the fractional\ncharge (δ+ must be equal to δ-) and the distance of charge separation (L). Although\ndipole moments can be measured, their values do not allow us to directly calculate the\npolarity of bonds between atoms since the detailed internal charge distribution is\nunknown. The direction of electron drift and, to some extent, the magnitude of its effect\ncan be estimated from the magnitude of the difference in electron affinity between the\n\nLN-2\nreaction partners. Because of a limited data base on electron affinity, L. Pauling\nintroduced a related term, the relative electronegativity (see below). From the above\nconsiderations it should be clear that no sharp dividing line exists between ionic and\ncovalent bonding. We might consider a completely ionic bond to result in cases where\nthe electron drift is such that one atom (the cation) becomes entirely deficient in one or\nmore electrons, and the other atom (the anion) becomes correspondingly electron-rich,\nthe bonding electrons being entirely under the influence of the latter. Hydrogen halides\nare σ bonded and have dipole moments; the bonds are referred to as polar covalency.\nThe homonuclear diatomic molecules formed by the halogens, viz. F2, Cl2, Br2 and I2,\nare all σ-bonded systems involving spin-pairing of the various pz electrons (2pz, 3pz,\n4pz and 5pz respectively). They have no permanent dipole moments.\nEnergetics of Covalent Bonding\nPauling extensively treated the energetics of polar covalencies, encountered in all\nheteronuclear systems (such as H-Cl) which have permanent dipole moments\n(Hδ+ - Clδ-). His approach visualizes the bonding to consist of two components - a pure\ncovalency and an ionic bonding component with attraction resulting from the interaction\nof the fractional charges on the nuclei involved.\nPauling determines the basic covalent bonding component, for example in the\nformation of HCl, from the experimentally obtained bond energies associated with the\nmolecular species of the components, H2 and Cl2. For this purpose he made the basic\nassumption that the covalent bond component between the dissimilar atoms is given by\nthe geometric mean of the pure covalent bond energies associated with these\n\nLN-2\nmolecular species. Thus:\n\nThe ionic contribution (Δ) to the polar covalent bonding is then obtained from the\ndifference between the experimentally determined bond energy (for HCl, for example),\nwhich obviously must contain both components, and the calculated pure covalent bond\nenergy:\nBEHCl (experimental) BEHCl (theoretical covalent)\n(The experimentally determined BEHCl = 426 kJ/mole.)\n426 320 106 kJmole\nIn connection with the presently discussed work, Linus Pauling established the now\ngenerally used electronegativity scale, or, better, the scale of relative electronegativities.\nThis scale, included in the Periodic Table of the Elements, is extremely helpful since\nvalues of the electron affinity are known thus far for only very few elements.\nThe electronegativity (x) scale lists the relative tendency of the neutral elements to\nattract an additional electron. (The values of x are conventionally listed in electron\nVolts.) The scale listed was obtained by arbitrarily fixing the value of xH = 2.2. Pauling\nobtained the values for the other elements by relating differences in electronegativity of\nreaction partners to the fractional ionic character (ionic bonding component) of the bond\n\nLN-2\nestablished between them:\nexperimental BEAB BEAA x BEBB k(xA xB)2\nor\n96.3 (xA xB)2 kJ\nAccording to Pauling, the bonding character between two different elements may be\ndefined as:\nionic bonding for: x > 1.7 ; covalent bonding for: x < 1.7\nThe fractional ionicity of polar covalent bonding as listed in the P/T is obtained by the\nrelationship:\n% ionic bonding 1 e0.25(xAxB)2 x 100\nBonding In Polyatomic Molecules\nIn the formation of covalent bonds between atoms in polyatomic molecules, the\nconditions that atomic orbitals distort so that maximum overlap may be achieved when\nbonding occurs produces more extensive changes of orbital geometry than is the case\nwith diatomic molecules. It will be remembered that the changes which result in a σ\nbond formation in diatomic molecules are a distortion of the s orbitals or p lobes so that\nstrongest bond formation results from the maximum overlap between the two joined\nnuclei. For polyatomic molecules extensive alterations in the spatial disposition of\natomic orbitals do occur, and very often the unique orbital geometry of the original\natomic orbitals is completely lost (fig. 7). It is sometimes convenient to view these\nalterations as occurring in each atom prior to bonding by a process involving the\nmixing, or hybridization, of atomic orbitals.\n\nLN-2\n-\ns H\npx\ndifference in electron affinity between O and H\nleads to fractional charges on the\nhydrogen atoms and to bond angle distortion\nbecause of electrostatic repulsion\npy\npz\nO\n-\n-\nsH\n-\n-\n-\nsaturated\nnon-bonding\npz-orbital\nδ+\nδ\nδ+\nδ\nO\nH\nH\nB.A. = 107o\nδ+\nδ+\nδ-\nδ+\nδ\nThe water molecule has a\npermanent dipole moment\nFigure 7\nBonding Involving Carbon\nIn methane (CH4) the four outer, or valence, electrons of carbon are shared with the\nelectrons of hydrogen; there is spin-pairing (resulting in bond formation) between each\nindividual hydrogen electron and one of the carbon valence electrons. The noble gas\nstructure is thus attained by each nucleus: the carbon nucleus \"sees\" eight outer\nelectrons and each H nucleus \"sees\" two electrons. Consider now the orbitals which are\ninvolved in more detail. Each hydrogen has one spherical valence orbital (the 1s orbital)\ncontaining one electron, and covalent bond formation results from its distortion, overlap\nwith the valence orbitals of carbon and spin-pairing.\nAccording to the Aufbau principle and Hund's rule, in its ground state carbon has two\nelectrons in the filled K shell and four electrons in the L shell: two 2s electrons and two\n2p electrons in singly occupied orbitals which are capable of covalent bond formation.\nThis configuration provides, in principle, only two orbitals (2px, 2py) for covalent bond\n\nLN-2\nformation. However, with two covalencies carbon will not yield the desirable octet\nconfiguration. Such a configuration can be obtained if one of the two 2s electrons is\n\"promoted\" into the empty 2pz orbital since this process results in four singly occupied\norbitals - all of which, being singly occupied, are capable of bond formation. The\ndissimilar singly occupied orbitals can assume (and therefore will assume) upon bond\nformation a lower energy configuration involving a process called hybridization whereby\nthe four orbitals (of two different types) hybridize into four identical orbitals of maximum\nequal spacing from each other (fig. 8). Thus the hybridized orbitals (sp3 hybrids) are\nlobes emanating from the carbon atom into the corners of a tetrahedron, forming bond\nangles of 10928'. sp3 hybridization is characteristic for carbon; however, other types of\nhybridization, sp2 and sp, are encountered in other elements as well. Boron, for\nexample, will tend to promote one of its two 2s electrons into a 2p state and, by\nhybridization, form three equivalent sp3 orbitals which assume planar orientation with\nband angles of 120. Beryllium forms sp hybrid orbitals of linear orientation (the bond\nangle is 180). All hybrid orbitals are capable of σ bond formation.\nThe great diversity of carbon compounds (it forms more compounds than all the rest of\nthe elements in the Periodic Table) can be attributed to the hybridization capability of\nthe carbon orbitals (sp3, sp2 and sp). As a consequence, carbon forms not only\naxisymmetric σ bonds (through axial orbital overlap), but also π bonds (through lateral\norbital overlap). In the compound ethane (H2C = CH2), the interactive carbon atoms\nundergo sp2 hybridization for a σ bond by overlap of two sp2 hybrid orbitals and form, in\naddition, a π bond by lateral overlap of the remaining non-hybridized p orbitals. (Double\nbonds involve one σ and one π bond.) In acetylene (HC CH), we find sp hybridization\nand, by axial overlap, σ bond formation as well as lateral overlap of the remaining\nnon-hybridized px and py orbitals which form two π bonds (fig. 9).\n\nLN-2\nH\nC\nH\nH\nH\n4 sp3 hybrid\norbitals\nenergy level\n2p3\n4 hybrid bonds\n3 sp2 hybrid\np-\norbitals\norbital\npartial hybridization\n3 hybrid bonds\n2 sp hybrid\nHybrid bonding orbital configurations:\n2 p-\norbitals\nsp3 tetrahedral\nB.A. 109o (CO2, BeH2)\n2 hybrid bonds\nsp2 planar\nB.A. 120o (SO3, BF3)\nsp\nlinear\nB.A. 180o (BeH2, CO2)\nOctet formation in the carbon valence\nshell can be achieved by sp3 hybridization\nwhich leads to 4 equivalent bonding\norbitals spaced tetrahedrally at 109o28'\nB.A.=109o28'\nCH4 formed by 4 molecular orbitals (σ-bonds)\nbased on overlap of sp3 and s atomic orbitals\n6C :\n2s2\n2p2\n2s1\norbitals\nFigure 8\nOrbital Hybridization\n\nLN-2\nlateral overlap\nof p-orbitals\npy\nπ - bond\nleads to π-bond\nformation\nH\n-\n-\nH s\nB.A.120o\n-\n-\nC\nC\n-\nC\nC\n-\nH\nH\nsp\n-\n-\n=\n+\n2H2 +\nthe overlapping\nsp2 orbitals\nEthylene has a double bond, the C atoms are bonded\nto each other with a σ-bond (sp2-sp2 overlap) and with\nbetween the C\natoms form a σ-bond\na π-bond (lateral p-orbital overlap)\nAcetylene has a triple bond: C atoms are bonded by overlap\nof sp-hybrid orbitals (σ-bond) and by lateral overlap of 2 sets\nof p-orbitals (2 π-bonds) configured at right angles to each other.\nFigure 9 Double and Triple Bonds\n3.\nMETALLIC BONDING\nThe stability of both covalent and metallic bonds may be regarded as arising from the\npotential energy lowering experienced by valence electrons under the influence of more\nthan one nucleus. In metals, where the valence electrons are not as tightly bound to\ntheir ion cores, we cannot expect the formation of strong electron-pair bonds. The bond\nenergies of known diatomic molecules of metallic elements are, in fact, smaller than\nthose consisting of nonmetallic elements: 104 kJ/mole for Hg2. Only diatomic molecules\nof the semi-metals have relatively high binding energies (385 kJ/mole for As2,\n293 kJ/mole for Sb2 and 163 kJ/mole for Bi2). These values reflect multiple bonding.\nMuch greater stability is possible in larger aggregates of atoms such as bulk metals.\nThe known properties of metals, such as low electrical resistance and malleability,\nsupport the conceptual view that the valence electrons in metals never remain near any\n\nLN-2\nparticular atom very long, but drift in a random manner through the lattice of ion cores.\nWe may therefore visualize metals as a lattice of ion cores being held together by a gas\nof free electrons.\n(Bonding in metallic systems is discussed in more detail in LN-3.)\n4.\nSECONDARY (van der WAALS) BONDING\nPrimary bonding (ionic, covalent and metallic) is strong and the energies involved range\nfrom about 100 to 1000 kJ/mole. In contrast, secondary bonding is weak, involving\nenergies ranging from about 0.1 to 10 kJ/mole. While this type of bonding, also referred\nto as \"residual\", is weak, it is essential in the functioning of our environment. Coke\nwould likely be gaseous and not a bubbly, refreshing brew were it not for secondary\nbonding, nor would catalytic converters function.\nThe energy difference between the liquid and vapor states of a given system is given by\nthe heat of vaporization, i.e. the heat required to convert a given liquid into a vapor\n(normally) at the boiling point temperature at 1 atm pressure. The energy difference is\ndue to intermolecular attraction between molecules at close distance of separation.\nThis phenomenon of attraction through secondary bonding can best be considered\nbetween a single pair of molecules, but recognizing that the forces are of longer range.\nFour types of intermolecular forces can be identified.\n1.\nDipole-Dipole Interaction: Molecules with permanent dipoles (such as water,\nalcohol and other organic compounds with functional groups) exert a net attractive\nforce on each other as a result of varying degrees of alignment of oppositely\ncharged portions of the molecules (fig. 10). For two polar molecules with a dipole\nmoment of (μ) separated by a distance of (r), the energy of attraction can be\nquantified as:\n\nLN-2\nδ+\nδ\nSchematic presentation of a dipole, exhibiting a Dipole-moment (μ)\nwhich is given by:\nμ = L.∂q\nL\nwhere L is the distance of separation of the fractional electronic charges\n∂q+ and ∂q- (in abbreviated form given as δ+ and δ-). In molecules the\ndipole moment is given by the vector sum of the polar bonds. Thus, because\nof molecular geometry (symmetry), molecules such as CCl4 exhibit no\ndipole-moment.\n:\nDipole-Dipole Interaction:\nδ+\nδ\nδ+\nδ-\nδ+\nδ\nδ+\nδ-\nr\nFigure 10\n\nx\nEDipoleDipole\n3 Dr6\nkT\nwhere μ is the dipole moment, r is the distance of approach of the oppositely\ncharged molecular portions, k is the Boltzmann constant (see P/T) and T is the\nabsolute temperature in K.\nThe molar energies of attraction associated with dipole-dipole interaction range\nfrom 0 to about 10 kJ/mole. These forces are primarily responsible for the liquid\nstate (at room temperature) of most polar organic molecules; they are a\ncontributing factor for H2O to be liquid at room temperature, and are responsible\nfor alcohol being a liquid.\n2.\nDipole-Induced Dipole Interaction: A dipole in one molecule can interact with and\npolarize the electrons of a neighboring non-polar molecule, thus generating an\ninduced dipole which will experience an attractive force with the polarizing, polar\ndipole (fig. 11). P. Debye showed that in a molecule with a \"polarizability\" of (α) the\nattractive potential arising from dipole-induced dipole interaction is given as:\nEDipoleInduceddipole\nDr6\n\nLN-2\nDipole-Induced Dipole Interaction:\nδ+\nδ\nδ+\nδ\nFigure 11\nInduced dipole interaction is important in aqueous solutions and very effective\nduring adsorption of inert molecules on active solid substrates.\n3.\nLondon Dispersion Forces: It is a well-known fact that all substances, including\nrare gases and hydrogen, assume liquid state at finite temperature, an indication\nof the existence of attractive interatomic and intermolecular forces, even in the\nabsence of permanent dipole systems. The origin of this force has been proposed\nby F. London in 1930. Accordingly, orbiting electrons will at any instance generate\na \"temporary dipole\", the configuration of which changes as the electrons move.\nSince all atoms of a given system similarly experience temporary instantaneous\ndipole moments, their effect is expected to be cancelled because of the\nstatistically random orientation of dipoles. It is evident that, should the dipoles be\nsynchronized in a given assembly of atoms, then a net attractive force would\nresult (fig. 12). But since such an attractive force constitutes a lowering of the\nenergy of a given system, synchronization can and will take place because all\nsystems will attempt to assume minimum energy configuration. The London\ndispersion force can be formulated as:\nELondon K\nr6\nThe attractive London forces are small, as manifested by the very low boiling\npoints of the smaller rare gases, of hydrogen and nitrogen.\n4.\nHydrogen Bonding: The short and long range dipole interactions calculated from\nmolecular dipole moments are inadequate in explaining a multitude of phenomena\nin organic as well as some inorganic systems.

A very simple model in which the metallic crystal is viewed as a\nlattice of positive ions surrounded by a \"gas\" of free electrons provides a crude\nunderstanding of the first and third properties. If the crystal has a gas of free electrons,\nit is easy to see why the application of an electric field will result in the motion of these\nelectrons and thus for the high electrical conductivity. This model also allows one to\nexplain the malleability of metals, as shown in fig. 1b. When a metallic crystal is subject\nto forces that displace one plane of atoms with respect to another, the environment of\nthe charged species is left unchanged. In contrast, the displacement of neighboring\nplanes in an ionic crystal as a result of a distorting force will lead to cleavage, largely\nbecause of changes in the interaction of the charged species (fig. 1a).\nThe free electron gas theory (Drude-Lorentz) also explains in principle the nature of the\nattractive bonding forces which hold the metallic ions (the metal) together: the crystal is\nheld together by electrostatic forces of attraction between the positively charged metal\n\nLN-3\nFig. 1a\nIn ionic crystals the displacement of\nFig. 1b\nIn metallic crystals the displacement of\nneighboring planes by shear forces frequently\nneighboring planes does not lead to charge\nresults in cleavage largely because of the\neffects; slip is a common phenomenon; metals\nestablishment of repulsive forces in the\nare malleable.\ncleavage plane.\nFigure 1 Mechanical properties of ionic and metallic crystals\nions and the non-localized, negatively charged electrons - the electron gas. The theory\nin its original form assumes that the classical kinetic theory of gases is applicable to the\nelectron gas; mutual repulsion between electrons was ignored and the electrons were\nexpected to have velocities which are temperature dependent according to a\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution law.\nWhile the Drude-Lorentz theory of metallic bonding was considered a useful model,\nseveral shortcomings soon became apparent. The most notable failure consisted of the\nunexplainable discrepancy between the observed and predicted specific heats of\nmetals (energy in the form of heat, required to increase the temperature of 1 g of a\ngiven metal by 1C). The D-L theory predicted much larger specific heats than are\nobserved (because the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution has no restrictions as to\nthe number of species allowed to have exactly the same energy). [If there are\nrestrictions as to the number of electrons with identical energy (Pauli exclusion\nprinciple!), we have to apply a different form of statistics (Fermi-Dirac statistics).]\n\nLN-3\n2.\nTHE ENERGY BAND THEORY BASED ON FORMATION OF\nMOLECULAR ORBITALS\nA different model, and one that is more closely related to the models of the chemical\nbond discussed earlier, is the band model. This model, proposed by Bloch before the\ndevelopment of the molecular-orbital approach to chemical bonding, is actually a\nmolecular-orbital model of metallic crystals. The orbitals characteristic of the whole\ncrystal are obtained as linear combinations of the atomic orbitals of the individual\natoms.\nFrom the large electrical conductivity of metals, it appears that at least some of the\nelectrons can move freely through the bulk of the metal. Since even lithium with only\none valence electron has eight nearest neighbors (crystallizes in a body-centered cubic\nlattice), it is clear that the atoms can not be bonded to each other by localized\nelectron-pair bonds (for in that case the lithium atom, which altogether has only three\nelectrons, would have to supply eight or even fourteen valence electrons to establish\nbonding with the nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor atoms). The fact that in a metal\nlattice one atom can simultaneously interact with a large number of others can be\nexplained by considering that metals constitute an extreme example of delocalized\nbonding.\nConditions in metals are not as easily assessed as in organic hydrocarbon chains\nbecause metal lattices are three-dimensional structures. However, several important\nresults from the theory of metallic bonding can be understood on a highly simplified\nmodel in which the three-dimensional lattice is replaced by a one-dimensional system.\nConsider the formation of a linear array of lithium atoms from individual lithium atoms:\nLi Li-Li Li-Li-Li Li-Li-Li-Li ...\nThe first stage is the formation of a lithium molecule, Li2, which is comparable to the\nhydrogen molecule, H2. The two lithium atoms are bound together by a pair of valence\n\nLN-3\nelectrons; each lithium atom supplies its 2s-electron which, through orbital overlap,\nforms a covalent molecular bond (fig. 2). The molecule formed occurs in lithium vapor\nσ*-anti bonding state\nEnergy\nSchematic presentation of σ-bond\nformation in lithium, resulting from\natomic 2s-state\natomic 2s-state\natomic orbital overlap.\nmolecular σ-bonding state\nFigure 2 Formation of Li2 molecule\nand differs from the H2 molecule only by its greater interatomic distance (Li-Li =\n2.67 x 10-10 m, H-H = 0.75 x 10-10 m) and smaller energy of formation. The larger\nseparation and the consequent reduction in bond energy can be attributed to the size of\nthe Li+ atomic core.\nIn the determination of molecular orbital states by linear combination of atomic orbitals\n(LCAO) we obtain more than one solution from the Schrodinger equation. We have so\nfar concentrated mostly on the low energy states, leading to σ or π bonds. We have\nlargely ignored the so-called antibonding states which in covalent molecules have\nenergies higher than the original energy states of the isolated reaction partners\n(presently Li) and, therefore, remain unoccupied (or empty) in two-atomic molecules. In\nany multi-atom system (such as a piece of metal), the total number of molecular orbital\nstates (electronic states) is always the same as the total number of original atomic\nstates (conservation of electronic states). However, not all of these states are\nnecessarily occupied by electrons.\nConsider the hypothetical linear molecule Li3. Since the valence electron cloud is\nspherical, the central lithium atom can not give preference to either of its neighbors.\nThe three atomic valence electron clouds overlap to form one continuous distribution\natomic 2s-state\n\nLN-3\nand two others with nodes (antibonding states), i.e., three molecular orbitals in all. (See\nfig. 3.)\nAs the length of the chain is increased, the number of electronic states into which the\natomic 2s state splits also increases, the number of states always equaling the number\nof atoms. The same occurs when lithium chains are placed side-by-side or stacked on\ntop of each other, so that finally the space lattice of the lithium crystal is obtained. It is of\ngreat significance that these electronic states have energies which are bounded by an\nupper and lower limiting value (see fig. 4). Within these limits the states form an energy\nband of closely spaced values (one gram of lithium contains nearly 1023 atoms).\nSimilarly, energy bands can also result from overlapping p and d orbitals. The electronic\nstates (orbitals) within an energy band are filled progressively by pairs of electrons in\nthe same way that the orbitals of an atom were filled in accordance with the Pauli\nprinciple. This means that for lithium the electronic states of the 2s band will be exactly\nhalf-filled.\nIt is of interest to consider why lithium atoms or Li2 molecules combine to form a metal\nlattice. In the lithium lattice the smallest distance between neighboring atoms is\n3.03 x 10-10 m, which is larger than in the Li2 molecule. This reflects the fact that bonds\nbetween pairs of atoms in the metal are weaker than they are in the molecule.\nNevertheless, the metallic form of lithium is more stable than the molecular form\nbecause in the metal one atom has many more neighbors than in the Li2 molecule. As\na result, the binding energy per gram atom of lithium (i.e., per 6.92 g of lithium) is\n163 kJ for the metal lattice, but only 56 kJ for one mole of molecule.\n[The possibility of hybridization (first advanced by L. Pauling to explain metallic\nbonding) is also a likely factor for the formation of metallic bonds. Thus strong bonds\ncan be formed when the valence electron clouds become concentrated along the\ndirection in which the bonding partners are situated.

One reason given for hydrogen not forming a metal is its inability to\nhybridize.]\nThe appearance of bands of allowed electron energies relates to the overlap of electron\nψ functions. The width of each energy band is a function of the crystal structure\nbecause it determines the number of nearest neighbors in the crystal. Different metal\natoms with the same valence, particularly elements in the same group of the periodic\n\nLN-3\ntable, can often replace each other in arbitrary proportions without altering either the\nlattice type or the structure of the energy bands. This explains why such metals tend to\nform a complete series of solid solutions. Metallic alloys consist of such solid solutions\nor of heterogeneous mixtures of such solutions. Within certain limits, even metal atoms\nof different valence can be interchanged in a lattice.\nBand Structure of Metals\nAccording to the above considerations the band structure of Li metal can be\nrepresented as shown in fig. 5.\nAccording to previous reasoning, the 2s band has N states (N = number of atoms) and\naccommodates n 2s electrons (where n is the number of electrons per atom in the 2s\nstate times N). Thus, this band has only half of the states filled since each state can\naccommodate two electrons of opposite spin (Pauli exclusion principle). In accordance\nwith the Aufbau principle, the lowest energy states of the band are filled first and the\nupper states remain empty - but can readily be occupied by electrons upon thermal\nexcitation or the application of an electric field. Since the width of the energy band is of\nthe order of a few volts, spacings of states within the band are of the order of\n~10-20 eV (1 eV = 1.6 x 10-19 J), electrons can readily acquire the energy necessary to\nmove into excited states, be accelerated, and move through the metal as conducting\nelectrons. Partly filled bands thus constitute conduction bands.\nThe conduction mechanism in Mg, for example, appears complicated by the fact that\neach 3s state of the valence shell in the atoms is doubly occupied (3s2). Thus the 3s\nband must be filled completely and no electronic conduction would in principle be\nexpected. Electronic conduction, however, is observed because of a partial overlap of\nthe 3s and the empty 3p bands. With this overlap, electrons can be activated into empty\n3p states and exhibit conduction, as in the partly filled s band in Li.\n\nEnergy\nLN-3\nfilled\nempty\nempty\n2p levels\n2s levels\nempty 2p energy band (overlapping\nthe half filled 2s band of Li)\nhalf filled 2s energy band\nisolated atoms\nsolid\nfilled\nempty\n2p level\n2s levels\nFig. 5 Schematic energy band configuration for Li .\nBand Structure of Insulators and Semiconductors (Molecular Crystals)\nThe same band model can also account for the lack of conductivity in covalent crystals,\nsuch as diamond. In the diamond crystal, with a two-electron bond between every atom\nand each of its neighbors, the bonding molecular orbitals form a band at much lower\nenergies than the energy of the atomic sp3 hybrid orbitals, and the antibonding orbitals\nform a band at energies much higher than the energy of the atomic orbitals. Also, since\n\nLN-3\neach atom contributes four orbitals and four electrons, there are just enough electrons\nto fill the bonding orbitals (corresponding to an electron pair bond joining every atom to\neach of its neighbors) and the only vacant orbitals are those in the high energy band of\nantibonding orbitals (see fig. 6).\nempty levels\n(Conduction band)\n4x1023 sp3\nhybrid orbitals\nEnergy gap (Eg)\nEnergy\nfilled levels\nfilled band of\nunfilled band of\n3x1023 2p atomic orbitals\n2x1023 sp3\nantibonding orbitals\n2x1023 sp3\nbonding orbitals\n(Valence band)\n1023 2s atomic orbitals\nFig. 6 Band structure of insulators and semiconductors (molecular crystals); the conditions\ndepicted reflect a molar crystal of carbon (diamond).\nBoth insulators and semiconductors have the same basic band structure - the primary\ndifference is the width of the forbidden energy gap (Eg) between the valence and the\nconduction band.\nInsulators, generically, are materials with very high resistivity (see Table I), comprising\nglasses, polymers, refractories, composites, liquids and gases. In the present context,\nan insulator is a molecular crystal, such as diamond (C) or sapphire, with a band gap\n(Eg) in excess of 4 eV (arbitrary value). Generally such materials will not conduct\nelectricity since their valence band is filled and the energy required to transfer electrons\n\nLN-3\nfrom the valence band to the empty conduction band is far in excess of both the\nthermal energies at room temperature and the energy provided by radiation of the\nvisible spectrum (~2 eV). Therefore, insulators (in single crystal form) are normally\ntransparent (colorless); however, if light is excessively or totally scattered at internal\nheterogeneities (such as grain boundaries), they may be translucent and even opaque.\nIt should also be recognized that impurities (Cr3+ in Al2O3) or particular point defects\n(color centers) may impart a color to the transparent insulator crystals. The color arises\nbecause of partial absorption of white light and selective transmission of the other\nportions of the visible spectrum.\nSemiconductors: The conventional semiconductors, silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge),\nhave a band gap (Eg) of 1.1 and 0.7 eV respectively and therefore absorb visible\nradiation; they are opaque (fig. 7). Considering the statistical nature of the thermal\nenergy distribution in the solid matrix (Maxwell-Boltzmann), a significant number of\nelectrons in the valence band will, at room temperature, acquire sufficient energy to\ncross the existing energy gap and thus provide for semiconductivity. The conductivity\nwill therefore increase with temperature, contrary to metallic systems, until electron\nscattering effects, due to increased lattice vibrations (which decrease the mobility of\nelectrons), begin to dominate.\nThe value of semiconductors for solid state device fabrication lies in the fact that the\nnumber and type of conducting electric charge carriers [electrons are n-type (negative),\nholes are p-type (positive)] can be controlled through incorporation of appropriate\ndopant elements. Thus the substitutional incorporation of Group V elements (Sb, As, P)\nprovides for shallow donor levels in the band gap at about 0.01 eV from the conduction\nband. The substitutional incorporation of Group III elements (B, Al) generates acceptor\nlevels in the band gap at about 0.01 eV from the valence band.

      "content": "LN-4\n3.091 - Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nLecture Notes No. 4\nTHE NATURE OF CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS\nIn an assembly of atoms or molecules a solid phase is formed whenever the\ninteratomic (intermolecular) attractive forces significantly exceed the disruptive thermal\nforces and thus restrict the mobility of atoms, forcing them into more-or-less fixed\npositions. From energy considerations it is evident (as discussed in LN-2) that in such\nsolids the atoms or molecules will always attempt to assume highly ordered structures\nwhich are characterized by symmetry. Depending on the nature of the acting\ninteratomic forces, all solids may be subdivided into:\n(a)\nIonic solids\n(NaCl)\n(b)\nCovalent solids\n(Diamond)\n(c)\nMetallic solids\n(Fe, Ni, etc.)\n(d)\nVan der Waals solids\n(ice, solid He)\nSolids as we encounter them in nature may or may not reflect the internally ordered\narrangement in their appearance. We find, for example, well-formed quartz crystals,\ngarnets, diamonds and snowflakes which are all characterized by flat bounding planes\nwhich intersect at characteristic angles. On the other hand, we also observe rounded\nstones and man-made cast solid objects with no external evidence of internal order\n(fig. 1).\nFigure 1 Crystals, internal order and external appearance\nwater\nice\nsnow flake\nmelt\ncrystals\nsingle\ncrystal\nc1\nc2\nc3\nc4\nc5\npoly crystalline solid\nconsisting of intergrown\nrandomly oriented single\ncrystals\nq (heat)\nq (heat)\n\nLN-4\nTo understand the external appearance of the solid state it is necessary to consider the\nformation of solids from different phases. Solids, for example, are formed upon cooling\nof liquids (melts) - by freezing or solidification; this solidification process normally\nproceeds in total confinement and the resulting \"cast\" structure will have an external\nappearance which reflects in detail the confining geometry (and not the internal order).\nMoreover, depending on solidification conditions, the solid body may be either a single\ncrystal or polycrystalline. Polycrystalline solids (in excess of 95% of the solid state\nencountered) may be thought of as an assembly of microscopic single crystals with\nrandom orientation held together like a maze structure by the interwoven irregular\nshapes of the individual crystals.\nA typical example of an \"unconfined\" phase transformation is the formation of\nsnowflakes where the external boundaries of the solid have assumed crystalline\nappearance, reflecting in detail the internally ordered molecular (H2O) arrangement.\nAnother unconfined formation of a solid is precipitation from solution (sugar crystals,\nCuSO4 and the like). Similarly, the formation of crystals from the vapor phase leads to\nbodies which externally reflect elements of internal order.\n1.\nCRYSTAL STRUCTURE\nFrom the earlier discussion it should be apparent that, when strong interatomic forces\nexist, atoms tend to pack closely together - the closeness of packing being particularly\npronounced in the solid state. In this case atoms can be regarded as hard spheres and\nthe problem of close packing can be treated as one in which the whole assembly has a\ntendency toward efficient packing. A little thought or a few simple experiments with\nping-pong balls quickly convince us that regular arrangements of the spheres generally\nlead to more compact assemblies than irregular arrangements (fig. 2). The same\nprinciple applies to arrangement of atoms in the solid state. Where strong attractive\nforces are exerted we find that the atoms or molecules concerned arrange themselves\n\nLN-4\nFigure 2 The packing density of ordered systems.\nin a regular three-dimensional pattern. It is this regularity which is the basis of\ncrystallinity in materials: i.e., a crystal structure is nothing more than an orderly array of\natoms or molecules. This definition of a crystal is distinct from the popular concept\nbased on observation of external symmetry of crystals, often seen during the study of\nelementary chemistry, in which some crystals appear cubic, others needle-shaped and\nso on. The regular external shape is obtained only when the conditions of crystallization\nare favorable to development of flat, geometric faces. In most instances, particularly\nwith metals, these conditions are absent, and the crystals have irregular surfaces even\nthough the internal arrangement is perfectly geometric.\nAtomic arrays in crystals are conveniently described with respect to a three-dimensional\nnet of straight lines. Consider a lattice of lines, as in fig. 3, dividing space into\nequal-sized prisms which stand side-by-side with all faces in contact, thereby filling all\nspace and leaving no voids. The intersections of these lines are points of a space\nlattice, i.e., a geometrical abstraction which is useful as a reference in describing and\ncorrelating symmetry of actual crystals. These lattice points are of fundamental\nimportance in describing crystals for they may be the positions occupied by individual\natoms in crystals or they may be points about which several atoms are clustered. Since\nprisms of many different shapes can be drawn through the points of a space lattice to\npartition it into cells, the manner in which the network of reference lines is drawn is\narbitrary. It is not necessary that the lines be drawn so that atoms lie only at corners of\nunit prisms. In fact, it is more convenient to describe some crystals with respect to\n\nLN-4\nFigure 3 The space lattice\nprisms in which atoms lie at prism centers or at the centers of prism faces as well as at\nprism corners.\nAn important characteristic of a space lattice is that every point has identical\nsurroundings: the grouping of lattice points about any given point is identical to the\ngrouping about any other point in the lattice. In other words, if we could move about in\nthe lattice, we would not be able to distinguish one point from another because rows\nand planes near each point would be identical. If we were to wander among the atoms\nof a solid metal or chemical compound, we would find the view from any lattice point\nexactly the same as that from any other.\nThere are fourteen space lattices (fig. 4). That is, no more than fourteen ways can be\nfound in which points can be arranged in space so that each point has identical\nsurroundings. Of course, there are many more than fourteen ways in which atoms can\nbe arranged in actual crystals; thus there are a great number of crystal structures. Too\noften the term \"lattice\" is loosely used as a synonym for \"structure\", an incorrect\npractice which is frequently confusing. The distinction can be clearly seen if we\n\nLN-4\n7 Crystal systems\n14 Bravais Lattices\ncubic\na=b=c\nα=β=γ=90o\na\na\na\na\na\na\nα\na\na\nc\ntetragonal\na=b=c\nα=β=γ=90o\northorhombic\na=b=c\nα=β=γ=90o\nrhombohedral\na=b=c\nα=β=γ=90ο\nhexagonal\na=b=c\nα=β=90o\nγ=120o\na\na\nc\na\nb\nc\nmonoclinic\na=b=c\nα=γ=90o =β\nb\na\nc\nβ\ntriclinic\na=b=c\nα=β=γ=90o\na\nb\nc\nFigure 4 The 7 crystal systems and the 14 Bravais lattices\n\nLN-4\nremember that a space lattice is an array of points in space. It is a geometrical\nabstraction which is useful only as a reference in describing and correlating symmetry\nof actual crystals. A crystal structure, however, is the arrangement of atoms or\nmolecules which actually exists in a crystal. It is a dynamic, rather than a static,\narrangement and is subject to many imperfections. Although any crystal structure has\nan inherent symmetry which corresponds to one of the fourteen space lattices, one, two\nor several atoms or molecules in the crystal structure may be associated with each\npoint of the space lattice. This symmetry can be maintained with an infinite number of\ndifferent actual arrangements of atoms - making possible an endless number of crystal\nstructures.\nTo specify a given arrangement of points in a space lattice, it is customary to identify a\nunit cell with a set of coordinate axes, chosen to have an origin at one of the lattice\npoints (fig. 5). In a cubic lattice, for example, we choose three axes of equal length that\na\nb\nc\nα\nβ\nγ\nx\ny\nz\nFigure 5 Specification of Unit Cell parameters\nare mutually perpendicular and form three edges of a cube. Each space lattice has\nsome convenient set of axes, but they are not necessarily equal in length or orthogonal.\nSeven different systems of axes are used in crystallography, each possessing certain\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________\nLN-4\ncharacteristics as to equality of angles and equality of lengths. These seven crystal\nsystems are tabulated in Table I (to be considered in conjunction with fig. 4).\nTable I.

Each unit cell in a space lattice is identical in size, shape and\norientation to every other unit cell. It is the building block from which the crystal is\nconstructed by repetition in three dimensions. The unit cells of the fourteen space\nlattices are shown in fig. 4. All crystal structures are based on these fourteen\narrangements.\nThe body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic and hexagonal lattices are common and\nof prime importance in metals. Some of the metals associated with nuclear applications,\nsuch as uranium and plutonium, have crystal structures which are more complicated\n\nLN-4\nthan these three relatively simple types. In general, crystalline ceramics also are more\ncomplex.\n2.\nUNIT CELLS VS PRIMITIVE CELLS\nIn the literature we often find reference to unit cells and to primitive cells. The primitive\ncell may be defined as a geometrical shape which, when repeated indefinitely in three\ndimensions, will fill all space and is the equivalent of one atom. The unit cell differs from\nthe primitive cell in that it is not restricted to being the equivalent of one atom. In some\ncases the two coincide. For instance, in fig. 4 all fourteen space lattices are shown by\ntheir unit cells. Of these fourteen, only seven (which are those?) are also primitive cells.\nPrimitive cells are drawn with lattice points at all corners, and each primitive cell\ncontains the equivalent of one atom. For instance, a simple cubic unit cell has an atom\nat each corner. However, at any of these given corners, this atom must be shared with\nseven other identical cubes which fill the volume surrounding this point. Thus there is\neffectively only 1/8 of the atom which can be assigned to that particular unit cell. Since\nthere are eight corners in a cube, there is the equivalent of one atom, and thus the\nprimitive cell and unit cell coincide.\nContinuing, consider the body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. In this case there is one\natom at the center of the cube and one atom contributed by the eight corners. This cell,\nthen, has two atoms and, to avoid confusion, should be termed a unit cell. In the\nface-centered cubic lattice there are six face atoms, but each face atom is shared by\ntwo cells. Consequently, each face contributes 1/2 an atom. The faces thus contribute\nthree atoms and the corners one, for a total of four atoms in the unit cell. The\nface-centered cubic structure (FCC) can also be considered as four interpenetrating\nsimple cubic cells.\n\nLN-4\nIn the study of crystals the primitive cell has limited use because the unit cell more\nclearly demonstrates the symmetrical features of a lattice. In other words, the unit cell\ncan usually be visualized readily whereas the primitive cell cannot. For example, the\ncubic nature of the face-centered cubic lattice is immediately apparent in the unit cell,\nbut it is not nearly so obvious in the rhombohedral primitive cell.\n3.\nPACKING OF ATOMS\nA crystal structure is a regular array of atoms arranged on one of the fourteen space\nlattices. The least complicated crystal structures are those having a single atom at each\nlattice point. Polonium has the simplest structure, being simple cubic. In normal metals,\nthe atoms (or positive ions) are held together by a cloud of free electrons so that each\natom tends to be attracted equally and indiscriminately to all its geometrically nearest\nneighbors by the free electrons passing between them. This condition fosters the\nformation of closely packed structures of the types which can be demonstrated by\nefficiently packing uniformly-sized spheres into a given volume.\nYou can gain a better grasp of packing by conducting an experiment as follows.\nAssume we have a quantity of small spheres which we are required to efficiently pack\ninto a box (a 'two-dimensional' approach can be made using a handful of pennies).\nAfter some shuffling, it is obvious that the closest possible packing is obtained when the\nspheres are in contact and their centers occupy positions which correspond to the\napices of equilateral triangles (fig. 6). It is also evident that there are two sets of\nFigure 6 Close packed atomic arrangements\n\nLN-4\ntriangles - one set with vertices pointing away from the observer (points up) and the\nother set with vertices pointing toward the observer (points down).\nWhen a second layer is added, there is closest-packing if the spheres in this new layer\nrest in the hollows formed by the spheres of the first layer. The centers of the spheres\nin the second layer will lie above the centers of the points-up triangles or above the\ncenters of the points-down triangles, but not both simultaneously. Which set is used is\nimmaterial. For our discussion, however, assume the second layer is centered on the\npoints-up triangles.\nWhen we start adding a third layer, the spheres will again rest in the hollows formed by\nthe spheres in the second layer. And again we have the option of placing the third layer\non the points-up or on the points-down triangles. If we center the third layer on the\npoints-down triangles, we find the third layer is directly above the first layer. If additional\nlayers are added using an alternate stacking sequence (i.e., alternately centering the\nlayers on the points-up and the points-down triangles), the sequence can be written as\nABABABAB. . . This arrangement of spheres, translated to an arrangement of atoms, is\nthe hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure - very important, but not discussed in\ndetail here.\nMany elements having covalent bonding form arrangements in which the coordination\nnumber is (8-N), where N is the number of valence electrons. What, then, is the\ncoordination number of the HCP structure just demonstrated? The geometry of the\nstructure shows that any one atom has twelve equidistant neighbors. It is apparent that\nif, in any layer, a given sphere is placed in the adjoining layer, it fits in the hollow formed\nby three spheres and consequently is tangent to three spheres in the adjoining layer.\nThus any given atom in the HCP structure is tangent to twelve other atoms - six in its\nown layer and three each in two adjoining layers.\n\nLN-4\nWhen the third layer of spheres was added in the above discussion, we assumed this\nlayer was centered on the points-down triangles of the second layer. What happens if\nthe centers of the points-up triangles of the second layer are used instead? The\ndistribution of spheres in the third layer is the same as in the first two layers, but does\nnot lie directly above either of these two layers. If a fourth layer is added, centered on\nthe points-up triangles of the third layer, we find the fourth layer is directly above the\nfirst layer and duplicates it completely. The stacking sequence for this structure can be\nwritten as ABCABCABC. . . This arrangement has the same density of packing and the\nsame coordination number as the HCP structure. However, it is the face-centered cubic\n(FCC) structure.\nThe HCP and FCC crystal structures have the same density of packing and the same\ncoordination number. Therefore we might expect the behavior of the two HCP and FCC\nstructures to be very much alike with regard to physical and mechanical properties.\nThis, however, in most instances is not the case.\nThe maximum density of packing is found only in the HCP and FCC crystal structures.\nWhy the metallic bond does not always produce one or the other of these two densest\narrangements of atoms is as yet subject of intensive studies. The BCC unit cell contains\ntwo atoms, and the coordination number is eight. There is partial compensation for this\nin the fact that there are six next-nearest neighbors at distances only slightly greater\nthan that of the eight nearest neighbors. Some characteristics of cubic structures are\ngiven in Table II.\nAn interesting example of the type of crystal structure obtained in covalently bonded\nelements which obey the (8-N) coordination number rule (where N is the number of\nvalence electrons) is the diamond structure. This structure is found in carbon,\ngermanium, silicon, and tin at low temperatures and in certain compounds. Each atom\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nLN-4\nhas four nearest neighbors - a configuration that is variously called diamond cubic,\nbody-centered tetrahedral or tetrahedral cubic.\nTABLE II.

Rock salt (NaCl), for example,\nis typical of many oxides, fluorides, chlorides, hydrides and carbides. It is sometimes\nconsidered as simple cubic with alternate Na and Cl atoms on the cube corners.\nActually the structure is two interpenetrating FCC lattices - one of Na and the other of\nCl - and the corner of one is located at point 1/2, 0, 0 of the other.\nMany other oxides, fluorides and some intermetallic compounds have the fluorite\n(CaF2) structure. This is FCC with Ca at the cube corners and face centers and F at all\nquarter points along the cube diagonals.\n\nLN-4\n4.\nLATTICE PLANES AND DIRECTIONS\nIt is desirable to have a system of notation for planes within a crystal or space lattice\nsuch that the system specifies orientation without giving position in space. Miller indices\nare used for this purpose. These indices are based on the intercepts of a plane with the\nthree crystal axes - i.e., the three edges of the unit cell. The intercepts are measured in\nterms of the edge lengths or dimensions of the unit cell which are the unit distances\nfrom the origin along the three axes. For instance, the plane that cuts the x-axis at a\ndistance from the origin equal to one-half the x-dimension of the cell is said to have an\nx-intercept equal to 1/2, and if it cuts the y-axis at 1/2 the y-dimension of the cell, the\ny-intercept is 1/2, regardless of the relative magnitudes of the x- and y-dimensions. If a\nplane is parallel to an axis, it intercepts the axis at infinity.\nTo determine Miller indices (hkl) of a plane, we take the following steps:\n1.\nFind the intercepts on the three axes in multiples or fractions of the edge\nlengths along each axis.\n2.\nDetermine the reciprocals of these numbers.\n3.\nReduce the reciprocals to the three smallest integers having the same ratio\nas the reciprocals.\n4.\nEnclose these three integral numbers in parentheses, e.g., (hkl).\nA cube has six equivalent faces. If we have a definite orientation and wish to discuss\none specific plane of these six, it is possible to specify this plane by using the proper\nMiller indices. Parentheses are used around the Miller indices to signify a specific\nplane. On the other hand, it is often advantageous to talk about planes of a \"form\" - i.e.,\na family of equivalent planes such as the six faces of a cube. To do this it is customary\nto use the Miller indices, but to enclose them in curly brackets (braces). Thus the set of\ncube faces can be represented as {100} in which\n{100} = (100) + (010) + (001) + (100) + (010) + (001)\n\nLN-4\nThis notation thus provides a shorthand scheme to avoid writing the indices for all six\ncube faces.\nThe utility of the scheme is even more evident in the case of the (110) planes - i.e., the\ndodecahedral planes (in a cubic system), where\n{110} = (110) + (101) + (011) + (110) + (101) + (011)\n+ (110) + (101) + (011) + (110) + (101) + (011)\nThe equivalent form for the orthorhombic system is\n{110} = (110) + (110) + (110) + (110)\n{101} = (101) + (101) + (101) + (101)\n{011} = (011) + (011) + (011) + (011)\nThe octahedral planes for the cube are\n{111} = (111) + (111) + (111) + (111)\n+ (111) +(111) + (111) + (111)\nDirection indices are defined in a different manner. A line is constructed through the\norigin of the crystal axis in the direction under consideration and the coordinates of a\npoint on the line are determined in multiples of lattice parameters of the unit cell. The\nindices of the direction are taken as the smallest integers proportional to these\ncoordinates and are closed in square brackets. For example, suppose the coordinates\nare x = 3a, y = b and z = c/2, then the smallest integers proportional to these three\nnumbers are 6, 2 and 1 and the line has a [621] direction. As further examples, the\nx-axis has direction indices [100], the y-axis [010] and the z-axis [001]. A face diagonal\nof the xy face of the unit cell has direction indices [110], and a body diagonal of the cell\nhas direction indices [111]. Negative indices occur if any of the coordinates are\nnegative. For example, the -y axis has indices [010].

Rontgen was interested in the cathode rays\n(beams of electrons) developed in discharge tubes, but it is not clear exactly which\naspects of cathode rays he intended to study. By chance he noticed that a fluorescent\nscreen (ZnS + Mn++) lying on a table some distance from the discharge tube emitted a\nflash of light each time an electrical discharge was passed through the tube. Realizing\nthat he had come upon something completely new, he devoted his energies to\ninvestigating the properties of the unknown ray \"X\" which produced this effect. The\nannouncement of this discovery appeared in December 1895 as a concise ten page\npublication.\nThe announcement of the discovery of X-rays was received with great interest by the\npublic. Rontgen himself prepared the first photographs of the bones in a living hand,\nand use of the radiation was quickly adopted in medicine. In the succeeding fifteen\nyears, however, very few fundamental insights were gained into the nature of\n\nLN-5\nX-radiation. There was some indication that the rays were waves, but the evidence was\nnot clear-cut and could be interpreted in several ways. Then, at the University of\nMunich in 1912, Max von Laue performed one of the most significant experiments of\nmodern physics. At his suggestion, Paul Knipping (who had just completed a doctoral\nthesis with Rontgen) and Walter Friedrich (a newly appointed assistant to Sommerfeld)\ndirected a beam of X-rays at a crystal of copper sulfate and attempted to record the\nscattered beams on a photographic plate. The first experiment was unsuccessful. The\nresult of a second experiment was successful. They observed the presence of spots\nproduced by diffracted X-ray beams grouped around a larger central spot where the\nincident X-ray beam struck the film. This experiment demonstrated conclusively that\nX-radiation consisted of waves and, further, that the crystals were composed of atoms\narranged on a space lattice.\n2.\nORIGIN OF X-RAY SPECTRA\nThe interpretation of X-ray spectra according to the Bohr theory (LN-1) of electronic\nlevels was first (and correctly) proposed by W. Kossel in 1920: the electrons in an atom\nare arranged in shells (K, L, M, N, corresponding to n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., etc.). Theory\npredicts that the energy differences between successive shells increase with\ndecreasing n and that the electron transition from n = 2 to n = 1 results in the emission\nof very energetic (short wavelength) radiation (fig. 1), while outer shell transitions (say,\nM\nN\nouter shell transitions are associated with\nsmall ΔE, i.e. with the emission of radiation\nof long wave lengths\nL\n(x-rays)\n(x-rays)\ninner shell transitions\nare associated with large\nΔE, the emission of radiation of short wave lengths\nn=4\nK\nFigure 1 X-rays are generated by inner shell electron transitions\n\nLN-5\nfrom n = 5 to n = 4) yield low energy radiation (long wavelength). For hydrogen, you\nrecall, the wave number of the emitted radiation associated with a particular electron\ntransition is given by the Rydberg equation:\n1 R\nn2\nn2\ni\nf\nFor \"hydrogen-like\" atoms with the atomic number Z (containing one electron only) the\ncorresponding Rydberg equation becomes:\n1 RZ2\nn2\nn2\ni\nf\nFrom this relationship it is apparent that the energy difference associated with electron\ntransitions increases strongly with the atomic number and that the wavelength of\nradiation emitted during such transitions moves with increasing Z from the 10-7 m\nrange to the 10-10 m range (radiation now defined as X-rays).\nTo bring about such inner shell transitions requires the generation of an electron\nvacancy: an electron must be removed, for example from the K shell (n = 1), of an\natom. Such a vacancy is conveniently produced in an X-ray tube by an electron beam\n(generated by a heated filament which is made a cathode) impinging, after being\nsubjected to an accelerating potential of several kV, into a target material made anode\n(fig. 2). The impinging electrons will transfer part of their energy to electrons of the\nx-rays (Kα)\n1-50 kV\ne - (K shell)\ne - (from beam)\nM\nL\nx-rays\ncathode e- beam\ntarget material\nH2O cooled\nK\nvacuum\nx-rays\ntarget material (Cu for ex.)\nanode\nFigure 2 Generation of x-rays\n\nLN-5\ntarget material and result in electronic excitation. If the energy of the arriving electrons\nis high enough, some may knock out a K shell electron in the target and thus generate\na vacancy. [It should be clear that a K → L excitation cannot take place since the L shell\nis filled: excitation must involve (n = 1) → (n = inf).] When such a vacancy is generated,\nit can readily be filled by an electron from the L shell or the M shell of the same atom.\nThese internal electron transitions give rise to the emission of \"characteristic\"\nX-radiation which, because of its short wavelength, has extremely high \"penetrating\"\npower. [Since an electron beam is used to generate X-rays, the X-ray tube has to be\nevacuated: to dissipate the energy flux arriving at the target, the anode support (onto\nwhich the target is mounted) is water-cooled.]\nUnder standard operating conditions, the characteristic radiation emitted by the target\ncomprises two sharp lines, referred to as Kα and Kβ lines (fig. 3). They are associated,\nrespectively, with electron transitions from n = 2 to n = 1 and from n = 3 to n = 1.\nEmitted X-ray spectra were extensively studied by H.G.J. Moseley who established the\nrelationship between the wavelength of characteristic radiation and the atomic number\nZ of the radiation emitting target material (fig. 4). Experimentally he found that the Kα\nlines for various target materials (elements) exhibit the relationship:\nK Z\n(K Z2)\nMoseley's empirical relationship (which reflects a behavior in agreement with the\nRydberg equation) can be quantified. While the energy levels associated with outer\nelectron transitions are significantly affected by the \"screening\" effect of inner electrons\n(which is variable and cannot as yet be determined from first principles), the conditions\nassociated with X-ray generation are simple. Very generally, the screening effect of the\ninnermost electrons on the nuclear charge is accounted for in an effective nuclear\n\nLN-5\nKα\nIntensity (rel. units)\nenergy\nKβ\nn = 1 (K shell)\nn = 3 (M shell)\nλ Kβ = .6323x10 - 10 m\nn = 2 (L shell)\nλ Kα = 0.7101x10 - 10 m\nAn additional set of characteristic spectral lines (Lα ,Lβ) can be\nobserved at longer wavelengths.

Thus it is\npossible to use the\nν\nmodified Rydberg\nFigure 4 Moseley relationship for Kα and Lα radiation\nequation, taking σ = 1.\nAccordingly, we have:\nK 2\n2 1\n2 R (Z 1)2 3\n4 R (Z 1)2\nwhere: R = Rydberg constant and Z = atomic number of the target material. [The minus\nsign (-) only reflects radiative energy given off by the system.]\nSimilarly, for the characteristic Lα series of spectral lines (n = 3 to n = 2) we find, after\nremoval of one L electron, that the screening of the electrons in the K shell and the\nremaining electrons in the L shell reduces the nuclear charge by 7.4 (empirical value).\nL 1 1 R (Z 7.4)2 5 R (Z 7.4)2\nA second look at the X-ray spectrum of a Mo target, obtained with an electron\naccelerating potential of 35 kV (fig. 5), shows that the characteristic radiation (Kα, Kβ)\nappears superimposed on a continuous spectrum (continuously varying λ) of lower and\nvarying intensity. This continuous spectrum is referred to as bremsstrahlung (braking\nradiation) and has the following origin. Electrons, impinging on the target material, may\nlose their energy by transferring it to orbiting electrons, as discussed above; in many\ninstances, however, the electrons may come into the proximity of the force fields of\ntarget nuclei and, in doing so, will be \"slowed down\" or decelerated to a varying degree,\n\nLN-5\nKα\nKβ\nwave length (A)\nk Volt\nX-ray intensity\ncontinuous\nradiation\ncharacteristic\nradiation\nλswl = f(V)\nFigure 5 X-ray spectrum of Mo target\nas a function of applied Voltage.\nranging from imperceptible deceleration to total arrest.

Analytically, we have:\nc\nhc\neV hmax h\n;\nSWL eV\nSWL\nFrom this relationship it is evident that the cut-off of the continuous spectrum toward\ndecreasing λ's (λSWL) is controlled by the accelerating potential (fig. 5).\n3.\nTHE \"FINE STRUCTURE\" OF CHARACTERISTIC X-RAYS\nIt is customary to consider the characteristic X-ray spectral lines as discrete lines (Kα,\nKβ, Lα, Lβ, etc.). In reality, they are not discrete since the electron shells involved in the\nassociated electron transitions have energy sublevels (s, p, d orbitals). These sublevels\ngive rise to a \"fine structure\" insofar as the Kα lines are doublets composed of Kα1 and\nKα2 lines. Similarly, Lα, Lβ, etc., exhibit a fine structure.\nThese considerations suggest that X-ray spectra contain information concerning the\nenergetics of electronic states. Obviously, analysis of X-rays emitted from a target of\nunknown composition can be used for a quantitative chemical analysis. [This approach\nis taken routinely in advanced scanning electron microscopy (SEM) where X-rays,\ngenerated by the focused electron-beam, are analyzed in an appropriate spectrometer.]\nIn fundamental studies it is also of interest to analyze soft (long λ) X-ray spectra. For\nexample, take the generation of X-rays in sodium (Na). By generating an electron\nvacancy in the K shell, a series of Kα and Kβ lines will result. The cascading electron\ngenerates vacancies in the 2p level, which in turn can be filled by electrons entering\nfrom the 3s level (generation of \"soft\" X-rays). If the X-rays are generated in a Na vapor,\nthe 3s → 2p transition will yield a sharp line; on the other hand, if X-rays are analyzed\nin sodium metal, the same transition results in the emission of a continuous broad\nband, about 30 A in width. This finding confirms the existence of an energy band\n(discussed earlier).\n\nLN-5\nAn analysis of the width and intensity distribution of the X-ray band provides\nexperimental data concerning the energy band width and the energy state density\ndistribution within the energy band (fig. 7).\n2p\n3s\n-5.01\n-38.7\nE (eV)\nλ is fixed\n2p\n3s\n-38.7\nλ is variable\nE (eV)\nNa (gaseous)\nNa (solid)\nFigure 7 Soft X-rays from 3s - 2p transitions\nin solid Na and Na vapor\n4.\nUSE OF X-RAYS FOR STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS\nThe extensive use of X-rays for the analysis of atomic structural arrangements is based\non the fact that waves undergo a phenomenon called diffraction when interacting with\nsystems (diffracting centers) which are spaced at distances of the same order of\nmagnitude as the wavelength of the particular radiation considered. X-ray diffraction in\ncrystalline solids takes place because the atomic spacings are in the 10-10 m range, as\nare the wavelengths of X-rays.\n5.\nDIFFRACTION AND BRAGG'S LAW\nThe atomic structure of crystalline solids is commonly determined using one of several\ndifferent X-ray diffraction techniques. Complementary structure information can also be\nobtained through electron and neutron diffraction. In all instances, the radiation used\nmust have wavelengths in the range of 0.1 to 10 A because the resolution (or smallest\nobject separation distance) to which any radiation can yield useful information is about\n\nLN-5\nequal to the wavelength of the radiation, and the average distance between adjacent\natoms in solids is about 10-10m (1 A). Since there is no convenient way to focus X-rays\nwith lenses and to magnify images, we do not attempt to look directly at atoms. Rather,\nwe consider the interference effects of X-rays when scattered by the atoms, comprising\na crystal lattice. This is analogous to studying the structure of an optical diffraction\ngrating by examining the interference pattern produced when we shine visible light on\nthe grating. (The spacing of lines on a grating is about 0.5 to 1 μm and the wavelength\nof visible radiation ranges from 0.4 to 0.8 μm.) In the optical grating the ruled lines act\nas scattering centers, whereas in a crystal it is the atoms (more correctly, the electrons\nabout the atom) which scatter the incident radiation.\nThe geometrical conditions which must be satisfied for diffraction to occur in a crystal\nwere first established by Bragg. He considered a monochromatic (single wavelength)\nbeam of X-rays with coherent radiation (X-rays of common wave front) to be incident\non a crystal, as shown in fig. 8. Moreover, he established that the atoms which\nθ\nθ\nA\nB\nC\nd(hkl)\nincoming\nbeam\ndiffracted\nbeam\n2θ\nD\nFigure 8 Bragg's law, assuming the planes of\natoms behave as reflecting planes.\nconstitute the actual scattering centers can be represented by sets of parallel planes (in\nwhich the atoms are located) which act as mirrors and \"reflect\" the X-rays. In cubic\nsystems the spacing of these planes, d(hkl) (see LN-4), is related to the lattice constant\n\nLN-5\n(a):\nd(hkl)\na\n(1)\nh2 k2 l2\nFor constructive interference of the scattered X-rays (the appearance of a diffraction\npeak) it is required that the beams, scattered on successive planes, be \"in phase\" (have\nagain a common wave front) after they leave the surface of the crystal. In terms of the\nbeams labeled 1 and 2 in fig. 8 this requires that the distance AB + BC be equal to an\nintegral number of wavelengths (λ) of the indicent radiation. Accordingly:\nAB BC n\n(n 1, 2, 3, )\nSince AB = BC and sin AB\n[AB d(hkl) sin ] :\nd(hkl)\nn 2d(hkl) sin\n(2)\nThis relation is referred to as Bragg's Law and describes the angular position of the\ndiffracted beam in terms of λ and d(hkl). In most instances of interest we deal with first\norder diffraction (n = 1) and, accordingly, Bragg's law is:\n2d(hkl) sin\n[We are able to make n = 1 because we can always interpret a diffraction peak for\nn = 2, 3, ... as diffraction from (nh nk nl) planes - i.e., from planes with one-nth the\ninterplanar spacing of d(hkl).]\nIf we consider fig. 8 as representative for a \"diffractometer\" set-up (fig. 11), we have a\ncollimated beam of X-rays impinging on a (100) set of planes and at 2θ to the incident\nbeam a detector which registers the intensity of radiation. For a glancing incident beam\n(small θ) the detector will register only background radiation. As θ increases to a value\nfor which 2d sin θ = λ, the detector will register high intensity radiation - we have a\n\nLN-5\ndiffraction peak. From the above it is evident that the diffraction angle (θ) increases as\nthe interplanar spacing, d(hkl), decreases.\nThe diffraction experiment as presently considered is intended to provide quantitative\ninformation on the volume (the lattice constant a) and shape characteristics (SC, BCC,\nFCC) of the unit cell. The intensity of diffraction peaks depends on the phase\nrelationships between the radiation scattered by all the atoms in the unit cell. As a\nresult, it happens quite often that the intensity of a particular peak, whose presence is\npredicted by Bragg's law, is zero. (This is because Bragg's law deals not with atom\npositions, but only with the size and shape of the unit cell.) For example, consider the\nintensity of the (100) diffraction peak of a crystal which has a BCC unit cell. The phase\nrelationships show that the X-rays scattered at the top and bottom faces of the unit cell,\n(100) planes, interfere constructively, but are 180 out of phase with the X-rays\nscattered by the atom at the center of the unit cell. The resultant intensity is therefore\nzero. The rules which govern the presence of particular diffraction peaks in the different\ncubic Bravais lattices (SC, BCC and FCC) are given in Table I.\nTABLE I. Selection Rules for Diffraction Peaks in Cubic Systems\nBravais Lattice\nReflections Present\nReflections Absent\nSimple Cubic\nAll\nNone\nBody-Centered Cubic\n(h+k+l) = even\n(h+k+l) = odd\nFace-Centered Cubic\nh,k,l unmixed\nh,k,l mixed\n(either all odd\nor all even)\nThe rules given are strictly true only for unit cells where a single atom is associated with\neach lattice point. (Unit cells with more than one atom per lattice point may have their\natoms arranged in positions such that reflections cancel. For example, diamond has an\nFCC Bravais lattice with two atoms per lattice point. All reflections present in diamond\nhave unmixed indices, but reflections such as {200}, {222} and {420} are missing. The\n\nLN-5\nfact that all reflections present have unmixed indices indicates that the Bravais lattice is\nFCC - the extra missing reflections give additional information as to the exact atom\narrangement.)\nA hypothetical diffraction experiment: A material is known to be of simple cubic\nstructure; determine a, the lattice constant, by X-ray diffraction. In theory, the question\nmay be answered by placing the crystal into a diffractometer, rotating it into all\npossible positions relative to the incident X-ray beam and recording all diffracting 2θ\nvalues. From the above we know that the smallest observed θ value must correspond\nto diffraction on {100} planes and also that d(100) = a. We may now use Bragg's\nequation to determine a, the lattice constant:\n2d sin 2a sin\na 2 sin\nThere are two simplifying assumptions in this problem: (1) we know the system is SC\nand (2) we are able, through rotation, to bring all planes present into diffraction\nconditions.\n6.\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES TO X-RAY DIFFRACTION\nIn the context of this course we are interested in making use of X-ray diffraction for the\npurpose of (a) identifying (cubic) crystal systems, (b) determining the lattice constant, a,\nand (c) identifying particular planes or meaningful orientations. The possible\napproaches can, in principle, be identified through an examination of Bragg's law. The\nBragg condition for particular d(hkl) values can be satisfied by adjusting either one of\ntwo experimental variables: (a) λ, the wavelength of the X-ray beam used, or (b) θ, the\norientation of the crystal planes relative to the incident X-rays.\n\nLN-5\n(a) Fixed θ, Variable λ: One means of satisfying Bragg's law is to irradiate a stationary\nsingle crystal (θ fixed for all planes within the crystal) with an X-ray beam of \"white\"\nradiation, which contains the characteristic and continuous spectrum produced by an\nX-ray tube. (For λ variable we have the simultaneous exposure of a crystal to a range\nof λ values). Each set of planes will reflect (diffract) the particular λ which satisfies the\nBragg condition for the fixed θ. The diffracted beams may conveniently be recorded\nwith a Polaroid camera or, alternately, with an electronic imaging device. It is possible to\nanalyze either the transmitted or the back-reflected X-rays. This experimental\nprocedure is referred to as the Laue technique (fig. 9); it is mostly conducted in the\n(a)\ncrystal\nfilm\n(b)\nX-rays\nX-rays\nfilm\ncrystal\nFigure 9 Laue diffraction in (a) transmission and (b) back-reflection mode\nback-reflection mode. Note that the approach taken makes it possible to determine the\nvalues of θ for each reflection, but not the corresponding λ. Therefore, the technique\ncannot be used, for example, to determine lattice constants. However, it is very\nvaluable if particular planes or crystal orientations are to be identified.\n(b) Fixed λ (Monochromatic X-Rays), Variable θ: The basic prerequisite for this\napproach is the availability of a monochromatic X-radiation of known wavelength (λ).\nSuch radiation can be conveniently obtained by using a crystal (i.e., its diffracting\nproperty) as a filter or monochromator (fig. 10). Filter action is achieved by positioning\nthe crystal in such a way that the unfiltered radiation emitted by the X-ray tube\nbecomes incident at an angle, θ, on a set of low index planes which satisfy Bragg's law\n\nLN-5\nCrystal monochromator\nx-rays \"white\"\nfrom tube\nλ Ka radiation\nFigure 10\nIsolation of monochromatic\nradiation from target radiation\nfor the highest intensity radiation (Kα) emitted. The condition of a fixed λ and variable\nθ is experimentally used in two techniques.

Exposed to monochromatic X-rays, in this way a large number of diffracted\ncone-shaped beams are generated such that the semiangles of the cones measure 2θ,\nor twice the Bragg angle for the particular diffracting crystallographic planes. The\nreason diffracted beams are cone-shaped is that the planes in question (within the\nmultitude of randomly oriented grains) give rise to diffraction for any orientation around\nthe incident beam as long as the incident beam forms the appropriate Bragg angle with\nthese planes - thus there is a rotational symmetry of the diffracted beams about the\n\nLN-5\nspecimen\nin powder form\ntransmitted\nx-rays\ndiffracted\nx-rays\nKα radiation\n2θ2\n2θ1\n2θ1\n2θ2\n2θ4\n2θ\nopened filmstrip\n0o\n180o\n2θ\nentrance\nfilmstrip\ndiffraction cones\nFigure 12 Debye-Scherrer powder diffraction setup and analysis\ndirection of the incident beam.

Each diffraction peak (dark line) on the film strip corresponds to\nconstructive interference at planes of a particular interplanar spacing [d(hkl)]. The\nproblem now consists of \"indexing\" the individual lines - i.e., determining the Miller\nindices (hkl) for the diffraction lines:\nBragg:\n2d(hkl) sin\n;\nd(hkl) h2\na\nk2 l2\n2 4d2\nsin2\n;\nd2\n\na2\n(hkl)\n(hkl)\n(h2 k2 l2)\n\nLN-5\nSubstitution and rearrangement of above yields:\nsin2\n2 const.\n(h2 k2 l2)\n4a2\nAccordingly, we find that for all lines (θ values) of a given pattern, the relationship\nsin2 1\nsin2 2\nsin2 3\n\nconst.\n(h2 k2 l2)1\n(h2 k2 l2)2\n(h2 k2 l2)3\nholds.

The existence of defects also plays an important role in various\ntechnological processes and phenomena such as annealing, precipitation, diffusion,\nsintering, oxidation and others. It should be noted that defects do not necessarily have\nadverse effects on the properties of materials. There are many situations in which a\njudicious control of the types and amounts of imperfections can bring about specific\ncharacteristics desired in a system. This can be achieved by proper processing\ntechniques. In fact, \"defect engineering\" is emerging as an important activity.\nAll defects and imperfections can be conveniently considered under four main divisions:\npoint defects, line defects or dislocations, planar defects or interfacial or grain boundary\ndefects, and volume defects. We can also add here macroscopic or bulk defects such\nas pores, cracks and foreign inclusions that are introduced during production and\nprocessing of the solid state. Point defects are inherent to the equilibrium state and\nthus determined by temperature, pressure and composition of a given system. The\npresence and concentration of other defects, however, depend on the way the solid\nwas originally formed and subsequently processed.\nBriefly consider the effects of imperfections or crystal defects on a few important\nproperties of solids. The electrical behavior of semiconductors, for example, is largely\ncontrolled by crystal imperfections. The conductivity of silicon can thus be altered in\ntype (n or p) and by over eight orders of magnitude through the addition of minute\n\nLN-6\namounts of electrically active dopant elements. In this case, each atom of dopant,\nsubstitutionally incorporated, represents a point defect in the silicon lattice. The fact that\nsuch small amounts of impurity atoms can significantly alter the electrical properties of\nsemiconductors is responsible for the development of the transistor and has opened up\nthe entire field of solid state device technology. Practically none of the semiconducting\nproperties that led to these engineering accomplishments are found in a \"perfect\"\ncrystal. They are properties peculiar to the defective solid state.\nThe existence of dislocations (line defects) in crystals provides a mechanism by which\npermanent change of shape or mechanical deformation can occur. A crystalline solid\nfree of dislocations is brittle and practically useless as an engineering material. While\nthe existence of dislocations in crystals insures ductility (ability to deform), the\ntheoretical strength of crystalline solids is drastically reduced by their presence.\nWe should recognize that dislocations play a central role in the determination of such\nimportant properties as strength and ductility. In fact, virtually all mechanical properties\nof crystalline solids are to a significant extent controlled by the behavior of line\nimperfections.\nThe ability of a ferromagnetic material (such as iron, nickel or iron oxide) to be\nmagnetized and demagnetized depends in large part on the presence of\ntwo-dimensional imperfections known as Bloch walls. These interfaces are boundaries\nbetween two regions of the crystal which have a different magnetic state. As\nmagnetization occurs, these defects migrate and by their motion provide the material\nwith a net magnetic moment. Without the existence of Bloch walls all ferromagnetic\nmaterials would be permanent magnets. In fact, electromagnets would not exist if it\nwere not for this type of defect.\n\nLN-6\nThe presence of surface defects such as cracks causes brittle materials like glass to\nbreak at small applied stresses. This fact is familiar to anyone who has broken a glass\ntube by first filing a small notch (or crack) into the surface. Removal of cracks from the\nsurface of glass either by etching in hydrofluoric acid or by flame polishing almost\nalways raises the fracture strength. For example, glass in the absence of any surface\ncracks has a fracture strength of ~1010 Newton/m2 (as opposed to real glass which has\na fracture strength of ~107 Newton/m2).\n2.\nPOINT DEFECTS\nA.\nFormation of Point Defects\nAn incontrovertible law of nature states: \"Nothing is perfect\". This law applies to\nhumans as well as to the inorganic world of crystalline solids and can be formulated as\nthe 2nd law of thermodynamics:\nF = H - TS\n(1)\nwhere F is the free energy of a given system, H is the heat content or enthalpy and TS\nis the entropy, or disorder, term. If a reaction takes place at a temperature T, we find the\nchange in F (ΔF) related to a change in H (ΔH), the heat content, and possibly also a\nchange in TS (TΔS). Such is the case when defects are formed in a perfect solid: The\nenergy distribution in a solid (Maxwell-Boltzmann) suggests that a number of individual\natoms may acquire enough thermal energy to be displaced from the equilibrium lattice\nsite into an interstitial position. This process of point defect formation requires energy\nand leads to lattice strain which constitutes, as discussed earlier, an increase in the\nheat content of the system (ΔH is positive and increases linearly with the number of\ndefects formed). The departure from perfection by the generation of defects leads to\ndisorder (ΔS is positive). The magnitude of disorder generated (ΔS) is very large during\nthe initial step from perfection to slight disarray, but the increase in disorder (with a\ngiven number of defects generated) decreases as the overall disorder increases.\n\nLN-6\nCorrespondingly the term TΔS drops rapidly at the beginning and then flattens out. The\nnet result (fig. 1), free energy, exhibits a minimum for a certain number of defects in the\nΔ energy\nsolid [equilibrium defect\n+\ndensity = f (temperature)]; the\nH\nFminimum suggests also that\nF\nthe transition from perfection\n-\n-TS\nto equilibrium defect structure\nis spontaneous: it occurs\nn (defect density)\nnaturally!\nnequil.\nFigure 1 Thermodynamics of point defect\nWhile the detailed\nformation\nmechanisms for the formation\nof atomic vacancies in solids are still the subject of extensive research, the associated\nequilibrium energetics are clear: calculations of the thermal energy of atoms in a lattice\nshow that the average vibrational energy of lattice atoms is much less than 1 eV (the\napproximate energy change associated with vacancy formation, i.e., the least amount\nof energy required to form a vacancy) at room temperature. Therefore a lattice atom\nwill only acquire the energy ΔHd, the energy required to form the defect, upon the\noccurrence of a large energy fluctuation. Since the relative probability of an atom\nhaving an energy ΔHd or more in excess of the ground state energy is eHdkT, the\nprobability that an atomic site is vacant varies in the same way. In a (molar) crystal\ncontaining N atomic sites, the number nd of vacant sites is, therefore,\nnd ANeHdkT\n(2)\nwhere:\nnd = the number of defects (in equilibrium at T)\nN = the total number of atomic sites per mole\nΔHd = the energy necessary to form the defect\nT = the absolute temperature (K)\n\nLN-6\nk = the Boltzmann constant\nA = proportionality constant\nB.\nPoint Defects in \"Pure\" Metallic Systems\nPoint defects in \"pure\" crystalline metals are defects of atomic dimensions, such as\nimpurity atoms, the absence of a matrix atom and/or the presence of a matrix atom in\nthe wrong place. Some of these point defects are shown in fig. 2. An impurity atom that\nvacancy\ninterstitial\nself\ninterstitial\nsubstitutional\noccupies a normal lattice\nsite is called a\nsubstitutional impurity\natom and an impurity\natom found in the\ninterstice between matrix\natoms is called an\ninterstitial impurity atom.\nWhether a foreign atom\nFigure 2 Point defects in crystalline solids\nwill occupy a substitutional\nor interstitial site depends largely on the size of the atom relative to the size of the site.\nSmall atoms are usually interstitial impurities, while larger atoms are usually\nsubstitutional impurities.\nA vacancy is an atom site, normally occupied in the perfect crystal, from which an atom\nis missing. Often the term \"vacancy\" is used to denote a so-called Schottky defect,\nwhich is formed when an atom or an ion leaves a normal lattice site and repositions\nitself in a lattice site on the surface of the crystal. This may be the result of atomic\nrearrangement in an existing crystal at a high temperature when atomic mobility is high\nbecause of increased thermal vibrations. A vacancy may also originate in the process\n\nLN-6\nof crystallization as a result of local disturbances during the growth of new atomic\nplanes on the crystal surface. Vacancies are point defects of a size nearly equal to the\nsize of the original (occupied) site; the energy of the formation of a vacancy is relatively\nlow - usually less than 1 eV.\nThe number of vacancies at equilibrium at each temperature in a crystal can be\ndetermined from eq. (2), in which ΔHd is the energy necessary to take an atom from a\nregular site of the crystal and place it on the surface for a Schottky-type defect. When a\nsolid is heated a new higher equilibrium concentration of vacancies is established,\nusually first at crystal surfaces and then in the vicinity of dislocations and grain\nboundaries which provide sites for the atoms which have left their normal lattice site.\nVacancies gradually spread throughout the crystal (from the surfaces into the bulk). On\ncooling the vacancy concentration is lowered by \"diffusion of vacancies\" to grain\nboundaries or dislocations, which act as sinks. In both cases, the new equilibrium\nvacancy concentration is established only after a finite amount of time. The rate at\nwhich vacancies move from point to point in the lattice decreases exponentially with\ndecreasing temperature. Thus, on very rapid cooling (quenching) from a high\ntemperature near the melting point most of the vacancies do not have time to diffuse to\nsinks and are said to be \"frozen in\". This gives a considerably greater\n(\"non-equilibrium\") concentration of vacancies in quenched specimens than that\nindicated by the thermal equilibrium value.\nThe concentration of vacant lattice sites in pure materials is very small at low\ntemperatures - about one vacancy every 108 atom sites - and increases with increasing\ntemperature to about one vacancy every 103 sites at the melting temperature.\nVacancies are important because they control the rate of matrix (or substitutional) atom\ndiffusion - i.e., atoms are able to move around in a crystalline solid primarily because of\nthe presence of vacancies. (The mechanism by which they move is the same as that\n\nLN-6\nassociated with moving a car in a filled parking lot to the exit). This is shown\nschematically in fig. 3. Self-interstitials are generally not encountered in close-packed\nFigure 3 Dynamics of vacancy movements in a close packed solid\nmetallic systems, but may be introduced by irradiation. For example, high-energy\nneutrons from atomic fission can knock metal atoms from their regular sites into\ninterstitial sites, creating vacancy-interstitial pairs.\nC.\nPoint Defects in Ionic Solids\nPoint defects in ionic structures differ from those found in pure elements because of the\ncharge neutrality requirement. For example, in a pure monovalent ionic material a\ncation vacancy must have associated with it either a cation interstitial or an anion\nvacancy to maintain charge neutrality. Similar requirements hold for anion vacancies. A\nvacancy pair defect (migration of a cation and an anion to the surface) is usually called\na Schottky imperfection, and a vacancy-interstitial pair defect is referred to as a Frenkel\nimperfection (an anion or cation has left its lattice position, which becomes a vacancy,\nand has moved to an interstitial position). These two types of imperfections are shown\nin fig. 4. Self-interstitials are much more common in ionic structures than in pure\nelements because many ionic compounds have relatively large interstitial sites\navailable. That is, there are often interstitial sites in the unit cell that have nearly the\n\nLN-6\n-\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n+\n+\n-\nsame surroundings as\nSchottky defect\nnormal atom sites.\n(For example, in BeO\nthe Be atoms fill only\none-half the available\ntetrahedral sites,\nleaving four possible\ncation interstitial sites\nper unit cell. Thus a\nBe atom could go\nfrom a regular lattice\nsite to an almost\n+\n-\n+\n+\n-\n-\nFrenkel defect\nequivalent interstitial\nFigure 4 Point defects in ionic solids.\nsite with little\ndistortion of the\nlattice.)\nForeign atoms in ionic crystals produce defects that also must maintain charge\nneutrality. For example, in NaCl a monovalent cation, such as lithium, may simply\nreplace one of the sodium ions as a substitutional impurity. But a divalent cation, such\nas calcium, replacing a sodium ion must be accompanied by either a cation vacancy or\nan anion interstitial if charge neutrality is to be maintained. Correspondingly,\nmonovalent impurity cations in a divalent structure (e.g., Na in MgO) must be\naccompanied by an appropriate number of cation interstitials or anion vacancies.\nD. Point Defects in Covalently Bonded Solids\nSubstitutional impurities in covalently bonded materials can create a unique\nimperfection in the electronic structure if the impurity atom is from a group in the\nperiodic table other than the matrix atoms. For example, you already considered Group\nV and Group III elements in a Group IV matrix, such as As or B in Si.\n\nLN-6\nWhen foreign atoms are incorporated into a crystal structure, whether in substitutional\nor interstitial sites, we say that the resulting phase is a solid solution of the matrix\nmaterial (solvent) and the foreign atoms (solute). The term \"solid solution\", however, is\nnot restricted to the low solute contents of doped semiconductor systems; there are\nmany solid solutions, such as metallic alloys, that comprise a wide composition range.\n3.\nLINE DEFECTS\nLine imperfections, or dislocations, in crystalline solids are defects that produce lattice\ndistortions centered about a line. A dislocation is simply the edge of an extra inserted\nfractional plane of atoms (fig. 5). Normally the symbol is used to represent a positive\nFigure 5 Schematic presentation of a dislocation; the last row\nof atoms (dark) in the inserted fractional plane\ndislocation (extra fractional plane) and is used to represent a negative dislocation\n(missing fractional plane).\nThe importance of dislocations is readily demonstrated in the deformation of crystalline\nmaterials. The plane in which a dislocation moves through the lattice is called a slip\nplane. With an applied shear stress the dislocation moves, atomic row by atomic row,\nand one part of the crystal is displaced relative to the other. When the dislocation has\npassed through the crystal, the portion of the crystal above the slip plane has shifted\n\nLN-6\none atomic distance relative to the portion below the slip plane. In other words, the\nmotion of the dislocation has caused the crystal to change its shape - to be\npermanently deformed (fig. 6).\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nslip plane\nFigure 6 Plastic deformation of crystalline solid by slip associated with stress induced\nmotion of dislocation\nPlease note: on either side of the dislocation the crystal lattice is essentially perfect, but\nin the immediate vicinity of the dislocation the lattice is severely distorted. For a positive\nedge dislocation, the presence of the extra half plane causes the atoms above the slip\nplane to be put in compression, while those below the slip plane are put in tension.\nConsequently, the edge dislocation will have a stress field around it that is compressive\nabove the slip plane and tensile below the slip plane.\nPlastic Deformation By Slip:\nWhen single crystals of metal (or semiconductor) are pulled in tension, they will begin to\ndeform (elongate) plastically at relatively low stress levels, and \"blocks\" of the crystals\nslide over one another because of dislocation motion. Simultaneously, so-called slip\n\nLN-6\nlines appear on their surface. It is found that deformation by slip occurs most easily on\nplanes with high atomic density and with large interplanar spacing, while the direction of\nslip is in all instances an atomically \"close-packed direction\". For FCC structures we\ntherefore observe as the primary slip system {111} planes in <110> direction, while in\nBCC structures the primary slip occurs on {110} planes in <111> directions. (It should\nbe noted that an alternate deformation mechanism is \"deformation twinning\", presently\nnot to be considered.)\nDislocation Climb:\nClimb is the name given to the motion of dislocations when the extra \"half\" plane is\nextended farther into a crystal or partially withdrawn from it. Clearly, the climb process\nis not a motion of the plane, but rather its growth or shrinking as a result of the addition\nof atoms or \"vacancies\" respectively from the environment of the dislocation (fig. 7).\nFigure 7 Dislocation climb by (a) loss of atoms to surrounding vacancies\nand (b) incorporation of interstitial atoms.\nMultiplication of Dislocations:\nSince during slip each dislocation leaves the matrix, macroscopic deformation could not\ntake place given normal dislocation densities in the range of 106-108/cm3. Examination\nof the deformed crystals indicates that multiplication of dislocations takes place during\n\nLN-6\ndeformation. While there are a multitude of multiplication mechanisms, the one most\nextensively studied is the Frank-Read Source (not to be discussed in detail).\nDislocation Interactions:\nThe relative ease with which dislocations move across a solid matrix can be attributed\nto the severe displacements of atoms in the core of dislocations. If these local stresses\nare reduced, the mobility of dislocations - and thus the ease of slip - is reduced. It is\nfound that impurities in the vicinity of dislocation cores tend to reduce the local\ndistortion energy of the dislocations and thus stabilize the system against slip. In many\nsystems impurities are intentionally added (e.g., solid solution hardening) to increase\nthe strength of materials. Similarly, micro-precipitates tend to impede dislocation motion\n(e.g., precipitation hardening).\n4.\nINTERFACIAL IMPERFECTIONS\nThe several different types of interfacial, or planar imperfections, in solids can be\ngrouped into the following categories:\n1.\nInterfaces between solids and gases, which are called free surfaces;\n2.\nInterfaces between regions where there is a change in the electronic\nstructure, but no change in the periodicity of atom arrangement, known as\ndomain boundaries;\n3.\nInterfaces between two crystals or grains of the same phase where there is\nan orientation difference in the atom arrangement across the interface;\nthese interfaces are called grain boundaries;\n4.\nInterfaces between different phases, called phase boundaries, where there\nis generally a change of chemical composition and atom arrangement\nacross the interface.\nGrain boundaries are peculiar to crystalline solids, while free surfaces, domain\nboundaries and phase boundaries are found in both crystalline and amorphous solids.\n\nLN-6\nA. Free Surfaces\nBecause of their finite size, all solid materials have free surfaces. The arrangement of\natoms at a free surface differs slightly from the interior structure because the surface\natoms do not have neighboring atoms on one side. Usually the atoms near the surface\nhave the same crystal structure but a slightly larger lattice parameter than the interior\natoms.\nPerhaps the most important aspect of free surfaces is the surface energy (γ) associated\nwith surfaces of any solid. The source of this surface energy may be seen by\nconsidering the surroundings of atoms on the surface and in the interior of a solid. To\nbring an atom from the interior to the surface, we must either break or distort some\nbonds - thereby increasing the energy. The surface energy is defined as the increase in\nenergy per unit area of new surface formed. In crystalline solids, the surface energy\ndepends on the crystallographic orientation of the surface - those surfaces that are\nplanes of densest atomic packing are also the planes of lowest surface energy. This is\nbecause atoms on these surfaces have fewer of their bonds broken or, equivalently,\nhave a larger number of nearest neighbors within the plane of the surface. Typical\nvalues of surface energies of solids range from about 10-1 to 1 J/m2. Generally, the\nstronger the bonding in the crystal, the higher the surface energy.\nSurface energies can be reduced by the adsorption of foreign atoms or molecules from\nthe surrounding atmosphere. For example, in mica the surface energy of freshly\ncleaved material in a vacuum is much higher than the surface energy of the same\nsurface cleaved in air. In this instance, oxygen is adsorbed from the air to partially\nsatisfy the broken bonds at the surface. Impurity atom adsorption makes it almost\nimpossible to maintain atomically clean surfaces. As a result, surface properties such\nas electron emission, rates of evaporation and rates of chemical reactions are\nextremely dependent on the presence of any adsorbed impurities. These properties will\n\nLN-6\nbe different if the measurements are made under conditions giving different surface\nadsorption.\nB. Grain Boundaries\nGrain boundaries separate regions of different crystallographic orientation. The\nsimplest form of a grain boundary is an interface composed of a parallel array of edge\ndislocations. This particular type of boundary is called a tilt boundary because the\nmisorientation is in the form of a simple tilt about an axis, parallel to the dislocations. Tilt\nboundaries are referred to as low-angle boundaries because the angle of misorientation\nis generally less than 10°.\nWhen a grain boundary has a misorientation greater than 10° or 15°, it is no longer\npractical to think of the boundary as being made up of dislocations because the spacing\nof the dislocations would be so small that they would lose their individual identity. The\ngrain boundary represents a region a few atomic diameters wide where there is a\ntransition in atomic periodicity between adjacent crystals or grains.\nGrain boundaries have an interfacial energy because of the disruption in atomic\nperiodicity in the vicinity of the boundary and the broken bonds that exist across the\ninterface. The interfacial energy of grain boundaries is generally less than that of a free\nsurface because the atoms in a grain boundary are surrounded on all sides by other\natoms and have only a few broken or distorted bonds.\nSolids with grain boundaries are referred to as polycrystalline, since the structure is\ncomposed of many crystals - each with a different crystallographic orientation. In the\ncase of iron the grain boundary structure can be revealed by preferential chemical\nattack (etching) at the grain boundaries, while the grain structure in polyethylene is\nrevealed by the use of polarized light. The grain structure is usually specified by giving\naverage grain diameter or by using a scheme developed by the American Society for\nTesting and Materials (ASTM). In the ASTM procedure the grain size is specified by a\n\nLN-6\n\"grain size number\" (n) where\nN = 2n-1\nwith N equal to the number of grains per square inch when the sample is viewed at\n100X magnification. For example, at a magnification of X = 100, a material with grain\nsize number 8 will show 128 grains per inch2 - this material in effect has (at X = 1)\n1.28 x 106 grains per square inch. If the grains are approximately square in cross\nsection, this corresponds to an average grain dimension of 8.8 x 10-4 in*.\nIn polycrystalline samples the individual grains usually have a random crystallographic\norientation with respect to one another, and the grain structure is referred to as\nrandomly oriented. In some instances, however, the grains all have the same\norientation to within a few degrees. In this instance the material is said to have a\npreferred orientation or texture.\nC. Phase Boundaries\nA phase is defined as a homogeneous, physically distinct and mechanically separable\nportion of the material with a given chemical composition and structure. Phases may be\nsubstitutional or interstitial solid solutions, ordered alloys or compounds, amorphous\nsubstances or even pure elements; a crystalline phase in the solid state may be either\npolycrystalline or exist as a single crystal.\nSolids composed of more than one element may - and often do - consist of a number of\nphases. For example, a dentist's drill, something painfully familiar to all of us, consists\nof a mixture of small single crystals of tungsten carbide surrounded by a matrix of\ncobalt. Here the cobalt forms a continuous phase. Polyphase materials such as the\ndentist's drill are generally referred to as composite materials. Composite materials\nhave great importance in the engineering world because they have many attractive\nproperties that set them apart from single-phase materials. For example, the dentist's\n*ASTM has as yet not issued specifications in SI units!\n\nLN-6\ndrill has good abrasive characteristics (due to the hard carbide particles) and good\ntoughness and impact resistance (due to the continuous cobalt matrix). Neither the\ntungsten carbide nor the cobalt has both abrasion resistance and impact resistance, yet\nthe proper combination of the two phases yields a composite structure with the desired\nproperties.\nThe nature of the interface separating various phases is very much like a grain\nboundary. Boundaries between two phases of different chemical composition and\ndifferent crystal structure are similar to grain boundaries, while boundaries between\ndifferent phases with similar crystal structures and crystallographic orientations may be\nanalogous to low-angle grain boundaries in both energy and structure.\nThe concept of a solid consisting of a continuous phase and a discontinuous phase (or\nphases) leads to a simple classification of the various types of composite materials.\nTable 1 gives this classification, which is based on the structure (whether amorphous or\ncrystalline) of the continuous and discontinuous phases.\n\nLN-6\nTABLE 1\nClassification of Composite or Multiphase Materials\nDiscontinuous Phase\nContinuous Phase\n(or Phases)\nExamples\nCrystalline\nCrystalline\nAll metallic systems such as cast\niron, steel, soft solder, etc.; most\nnatural rocks such as granite and\nmarble.\nCrystalline\nAmorphous\nNone of practical significance.\nAmorphous\nCrystalline\nMost man-made ceramics such\nas building bricks and electrical\ninsulator porcelain, concrete,\npartially crystalline polymers,\nsome polymer-crystalline particle\ncomposites.\nAmorphous\nAmorphous\nFiberglass, asphalt, wood,\nhydrated cement, other gels.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n3.091SC Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Some liquids, because of complex molecular\nconfiguration or slow molecular transport, do not \"crystallize\" (assume an ordered\nconfiguration) upon being cooled to low temperatures, but instead form a rigid\ndisordered network, known as glass, which is very similar in structure to that of the\nliquid. Most metals and alkali halides crystallize easily upon cooling through the\nfreezing temperature because the structural rearrangement from the liquid to the\ncrystalline state is simple and bonding is nondirectional. At temperatures just above the\nfreezing temperature, most metals and molten salts have fluidities approximately\nequivalent to that of water at room temperature. Thus, the required structural\nrearrangements can take place relatively easily.\nIn contrast, many inorganic silicates form glasses upon cooling because the fluidity at\nand even above the freezing temperature is very low. This glass formation is related to\nthe high silicon-oxygen single-bond energies and the directional bonding requirements\nimposed by sp3 hybridization of silicon. The disordered liquid cannot flow easily and\nthus cannot undergo the rearrangements required for crystallization. Moreover, the\n\nLN-7\nA\nF\nz\nfluidity decreases very rapidly as the temperature is lowered. [For large organic and\npolymeric liquids, crystallization is difficult because of their chain lengths. In polymer\nsystems the intermolecular bonding (Van der Waals) is weak and expected to permit\nindividual molecules to readily slide past one another. Thus, it is the \"difficult\" structural\nrearrangement required for crystallization that induces glass formation in these\nsystems.]\nThe fluidity of liquids (the reciprocal of the viscosity) is a measure of their ability to flow.\nIn turn, the viscosity (η) (fig. 1) is a measure of their resistance to flow. Viscosity is\nvx\nformulated as the\nτ τ = F / A [N/m2] (shear stress)\nvx / z [sec-1] (shear strain rate)\nratio of an applied\nτ\nN.s\nshear stress to\nη =\n[\n] (viscosity)\nvx/z\nm2\nthe resultant\nFigure 1 Dimensional analysis of viscosity\nshear-strain rate\nits dimensions\nare Newton seconds per meter2. Liquid flow, involving the motion of molecules past one\nanother, requires the breaking and making of new bonds. Thus the fluidity, like chemical\nreactions and diffusion in solids (to be discussed later) is expected to exhibit an\nexponential temperature dependence and may be modelled as:\n1 e Bond Energy\n\nkT\nIt is noteworthy that inorganic glasses occur in nature as do organic glasses (such as\nthe sap from trees) whereas metallic glasses do not occur naturally and have been\nmanufactured only within the last two decades. The major obstacle to achieving metallic\nglasses was our inability to cool metallic melts to room temperature at rates high\nenough so that ordering (and thus crystallization) is prevented.\n\nLN-7\nThe glass transition point, Tg, (temperature at which a supercooled liquid becomes a\nglass) is for glasses what the melting point, Tm, is for crystalline solids. Characteristic\nfor almost all glass-forming materials is that at Tg a change in the temperature\ndependence of the density (ΔV/ΔT) takes place [where the viscosity is in the range 104\nto 106 Ns/m2 (the viscosity of H2O is 1.5 x 10-3 Ns/m2, or about nine orders of\nmagnitude less)]. At higher temperatures (lower viscosities) the structural units are able\nto reorganize themselves quickly as a quasi-equilibrium liquid. At temperatures below\nTg reorganization among the structural units virtually ceases and the resulting rigid\nmaterial is referred to as a glass. The experimental value obtained for Tg depends on\nthe time scale of the experiment. On slow cooling, for example, the structural units have\nmore time to reorganize and, thus, Tg is lower (fig. 2).\nheating curve\ncooling curve\nglass\ntransformation\nrange\nTg\nvolume\ntemperature\nsuper-cooled\nliquid\nstable\nliquid\nglass on\nfast cooling\nglass on\nslow cooling\ncrystal\nprocess of\nmelting and\ncrystallization\nglass transition temp.\nFigure 2 Volume changes associated with heating and cooling in\nsystems susceptible to glass formation.\n\nLN-7\n2.\nMETALLIC GLASSES\nThe existence of metallic glasses shows the generality of the glass-forming process. In\naddition, the physical picture in this case is especially simple. Even with the highest\npresently attainable cooling rates (up to 107°C/s), no \"pure\" metal has yet been\nobtained in a glassy state. However, if the liquid is an alloy of two (or more) metals\nwhose atoms differ greatly in size, the crystallization process is more difficult and can\nbe prevented in many instances by extremely rapid cooling of the melt (106°C/sec).\nThe two experimental techniques for rapid cooling are (1) propelling a liquid drop at\nhigh velocity and \"splatting\" it against a cooled copper surface, (2) flattening a liquid\ndrop between a piston and an anvil or between two rolls and (3) \"spinning\" the melt by\ntransferring it in a continuous mode onto a rapidly rotating, cooled wheel (fig. 3). X-ray\npatterns of the solidified alloys are similar to those of liquid metals - this and other\nevidence suggest that they are \"amorphous\", that their structure is that of a glass.\nmelt\nmetallic\nglass\ncooled at a rate of ~ 106 oC/sec\nrotating cooled\nwheel\nFigure 3 Production of metalic glass\nby melt spinning\nAnother method for preparing\nmetallic glasses is by vacuum\ndeposition onto a substrate\ncooled to approximately 80K.\nAgain, pure metals crystallize\nunder these conditions, but\nsuitable alloys form glasses,\nsome of which are stable when\nbrought to room temperature.\nAn example is the silver-copper\nsystem in which the two solid\nmetals have only about eight\n\nLN-7\npercent solubility in each other. If a melt containing 50 wt.% silver and 50 wt.% copper\nis slowly cooled, two crystalline phases are produced. When this same alloy is obtained\nby vacuum deposition, a metastable metallic glass is formed. Initially the glass has\nmetallic electrical conductivity comparable to that of the liquid alloy. When the glass is\nheated for 1/2 hour at 380K, it converts to a crystalline, metastable face-centered cubic\nsolid solution. Only on heating at about 500K does the equilibrium, two-phase structure\nform. Many pure nonmetallic elements, however, such as S, Se, Ge and Si, form a\nstable glass under suitable conditions.\n3.\nTHE GLASSY STATE\nThe properties and chemical composition of the glass used for optical purposes differ\ngreatly from those of the glass used for baking dishes. Likewise, the glass used for\nwindow panes differs from the glass used for artwork or optical purposes. However,\n(most) inorganic glasses have one thing in common: they are ceramic materials\n(compounds that contain metallic and non-metallic elements, most often oxygen) with\nthe amorphous structure of a frozen liquid.\nQuartz glass is not crystalline at room temperature because the rearrangement of\ninteratomic bonds between Si and O required for the establishment of order is impeded:\nthe viscosity of glass is so high at room temperature that millions of years would be\nrequired for it to crystallize (see above). Hence, glass can be viewed as a perfectly\nrigid \"liquid\", being exceptional in that its extraordinarily high viscosity slows down its\nflow properties even on an expanded time scale.\nUpon cooling of liquid \"glass\" we observe that ΔV/ΔT (the contraction with lowering of\nT) changes. This may be seen by following the three basic steps in the production of\nglass: (1) the melting of quartz sand (minute crystals of silica), (2) the shaping of the\nglass while in a viscous state and (3) the controlled cooling of the shaped article. The\n\nLN-7\nSiO4 tetrahedra in the sand (crystals) are arranged in an ordered pattern (fig. 4), but in\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nSi\nFigure 4 Basic Si - O - Si - units as\nestablished with sp3 hybridization of Si\nSi\nthe molten state the crystal\nmatrix breaks up into strings\nand rings of tetrahedra in\nirregular patterns (fig. 5).\nBecause the temperature is\nvery high, the groupings\ncontinually break up and re\nform, making the mass fluid.\nUpon cooling of molten SiO2\nthe tetrahedra form larger\nFigure 5 Two-dimensional view of tetrahedra as in silicondioxide structures: (a) in crystalline,\nordered structures and (b) in disordered glassy (amorphous) structures.\n\nLN-7\ngroupings and the glass becomes more viscous, permitting it to be shaped by blowing,\nrolling, pressing, etc. With continuing cooling, larger groupings of tetrahedra form as\ntheir kinetic energy decreases. These two phenomena are responsible for the increase\nin viscosity and the shrinkage that takes place during the cooling period. Beyond the\nglass transformation temperature changes in configuration of the tetrahedra virtually\ncease because the glass, to all intents and purposes, has lost its fluidity.\n4.\nOXIDE GLASSES\nThe bonding forces responsible for the formation of network structure in crystalline SiO2\nproduce similar networks in glasses of other oxides such as B2O3 and P2O5 which are\nthus also considered as primary network formers (the present discussion will be limited\nto silica glasses). If an oxide, such as Na2O, is added to silica glass, a bond in the\nnetwork is broken and the relatively mobile sodium ion becomes a part of the structure\n(fig. 6). Examples of such network modifiers are N2O, K2O, Li2O, CaO, MgO and PbO.\n-\n+\n+\n+\n+\n-\n-\nWith increase in\nthe amount of\nmodifier, the\naverage\nnumber of\noxygen-silicon\nbonds forming\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 6 Schematic glass networks; (a) SiO2 network\n(b) SiO2 network modified through addition of Na2O.\nbridges\nbetween silicon\natoms\ndecreases as\nfollows:\n\n____________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________\nLN-7\nO/Si Ratio in Glass\nBridging-O-Si Bonds/Si atom\n2.0\n4 (fig.7)\n2.5\n3.0\nO\nO\nO\nTwo bridging bonds per\nO Si\nO\nSi\nO\nSi\nO\nsilicon atom will correspond,\nO\nO\nO\nfor example, to a linear chain\nstructure, and any further\nSi\nO\nSi\nO\nSi\nO\nincrease in modifier would\nO\nO\nO\nreduce the length of the\nchain.

An excess of modifier can make the structural\nunits in the melt sufficiently simple and mobile that crystallization occurs in preference\nto the formation of a glass.\nThe compositions and properties of typical glasses are listed in Table 1. Soda-lime\nglass not only has the advantage of being made from inexpensive raw materials, but\nalso the practical convenience of low working temperatures (fig. 8). Most glass-forming\noperations (pressing, drawing, etc.) begin at the temperature corresponding to the\nworking point, but can continue while the glass cools.\n\nLN-7\nborosilicate glass\n96 % silica glass\nsilica glass\nsoda lime glass\nAnnealing\nSoftening\nworking\nlog10 (viscosity) N.s.m-2\nlog10 (viscosity, poise) g.cm-1.s-1\ntemperature, oC\nFigure 8 Important temperatures in fabrication of silicate glasses ( the temperatures\nare related to viscosity which in turn controls workability)\n5.\nANNEALING OF GLASS\nIn order to relieve the internal stresses that may develop during glass formation, all\ncommercial glassware is annealed (slowly cooled) immediately after shaping. This slow\ncooling operation is carried out in industry by placing the shaped objects on a conveyor\nbelt which transports them first through a reheating zone and then through sections\nhaving successively lower temperatures in a furnace called the lehr.\n\nLN-7\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\nTABLE 1.

The glass does not\nundergo a change from disordered liquid structure to crystal structure as iron does at its\ntransformation temperature; in glass, the transformation temperature is the temperature\nbelow which viscosity prevents any further configurational changes. Any contraction\nbeyond the transformation temperature range is due only to the lower kinetic energy of\nthe groupings.\nThe transformation temperature of a given \"glass composition\" depends on its\nconstituents and upon the rate of cooling. Slow cooling results in a lower transformation\n\nLN-7\nrange because the tetrahedra will have more time to rearrange (to some degree). This\nresults in tighter packing of tetrahedra as the mass reaches its transformation range.\nWhen the glass reaches room temperature, its volume will be smaller when cooled\nslowly than glass melt which has been cooled rapidly. Hence, slower cooling from the\nmelt results in a denser glass. (See fig. 2.)\nGlass is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature because configuration\nchanges (which require eons of years to come about!) would result in a lower free\nenergy configuration. However, the changes are so slow that they may be considered\nnegligible.\n6.\nPROPERTIES OF GLASSES\nThe strong covalent bonds that exist between the atoms of inorganic glasses plus the\nlack of crystal structure give glass unusual characteristics. Thus, quartz glass is:\n(a) Chemically stable;\n(b) A poor conductor of heat and electricity;\n(c) Inherently transparent;\n(d) Inherently strong.\n(a) Chemical Stability\nAll glasses are immune to oxidation (decay) because their atoms are fully oxidized.\nGlass composed of 100 percent silica tetrahedra is extraordinarily inert. It resists the\naction of most acids (the most notable exception is hydrofluoric acid, utilized to etch\nglass), but it is attacked by strong alkalis. (The bottles containing liquid alkalis on a\nchemist's shelf have a clouded surface.)\n(b) Conductivity\nThe ability of a material to conduct electricity is dependent upon the presence of\nelectrons in the conduction band, separated in glasses by as much as 10eV from the\n\nLN-7\nvalence band. Because the electrons in glass are tightly bonded, glass is a very poor\nconductor of electricity - in fact, the large energy gap makes glass an excellent\ninsulator. Glass is also a poor conductor of heat. Thus, hot common glass may crack\nwhen cold water is poured onto it because the surface exposed to the cold water will\nshrink while the dimensions of the interior remain unaffected.\n(c) Strength\nGlass is harder than many types of steel and is also very elastic, as evidenced by the\nspeed and accuracy with which glass marbles rebound when they meet.\nGlass has \"no\" crystal structure, and hence the phenomenon of slip cannot take place.\nThis, together with the strong bonding between atoms, gives glass a very high\ncompressive strength and a theoretical tensile strength of about 107 kN/m2 (significantly\nhigher than that of steel). (Glass fibers with an actual tensile strength of 4 x 107 kN/m2\nhave been produced.) Since glass has a \"liquid structure\" it may be considered\n\"saturated with dislocations\". [If a piece of metal has a very high dislocation density\n(eg., due to cold working) the dislocations interfere with each other's movements.\nTherefore, with increasing dislocation density a piece of metal becomes harder and\nstronger, but also more brittle.] Since the molecular structures in glass are unable to\nmove, the presence of minute cracks or imperfections in glass permits stress\nconcentrations to localize and exceed the bond strength between atoms - common\nglass will crack. Thus, in actual practice, the strength of glass is, by a factor of 100 to\n1000, less than the theoretical strength, and glass is brittle. For example, a freshly\nmade electric light bulb may not crack when initially dropped, but its surface becomes\ndamaged and, after it rebounds and strikes the floor a few more times, it breaks.\nThe inherent high strength of fibrous glass is utilized in the fiberglass sections\nemployed for boats and automobile bodies. Before being pressed into shape fiberglass\nis mixed with a synthetic resin which serves to protect the fibers from scratching. Since\n\nLN-7\nthe fibers thus retain their high strength, fiberglass sections are very strong for their\nweight.\n7.\nSTRENGTHENED GLASS\nThe glass scientist has produced objects made of glass which can be struck with a\nhammer or dropped from a tall building without breaking. Two techniques are employed\nin strengthening glass - one physical and one chemical. Both techniques are based on\nthe fact that, when there is the slightest imperfection (minute scratch) on the surface,\nglass remains extraordinarily strong in compression but becomes weak in tension. Thus\nthe strengthening treatment consists of prestressing a glass object by inducing\ncompressive strains in its exterior and thereby enabling it to counteract any tensile\nstresses which develop under tension.\nIn physical prestressing, the shaped object is heated to just below its softening point\n(surface flows are annealed out) and its surface is then chilled by means of a blast of\nair or an oil bath. Under these conditions the exterior of the glass cools and contracts\nimmediately, but since glass is a poor conductor of heat the interior will not contract\nthe glass will not crack because the interior remains plastic. When the interior starts to\ncool, it cannot contract because the exterior has already set, but, in attempting to\ncontract, the interior continues to draw the exterior together. A built-in compressive\nstress then develops in the outer layers of the glass. When a tensile stress is applied to\nthis glass, it is counteracted by these compressive stresses. Thus the prestressed glass\nwill not shatter until the surface compression is exceeded.\nAs long as its surface remains intact, prestressed glass continues to be strong and\nshock-resistant. However, if a deep scratch develops on the surface, the tensile\nstresses set up in the interior by the surface compression are released and the glass\nwill shatter into thousands of tiny particles. Therefore prestressed articles must be cut\n\nLN-7\nto exact size and all holes drilled prior to prestressing. Among the many uses for this\ntype of glass are plate-glass doors, side windows of automobiles and portholes of\nships.\nIon exchange is a chemical technique for prestressing glass objects. The first step is to\nplace the shaped object into a molten salt bath containing potassium ions, which\nreplace the sodium ions on the surface of the glass. The potassium ions are larger than\nthe sodium ions and, in accommodating them, the surface of the glass becomes more\ncrowded - thus inducing compressive strains on the exterior. Glass of this type,\ncharacterized by very high strength, is useful for a great variety of applications. Its\nflexural strength can be as high as 106 kN/m2 compared with 105 kN/m2 for untreated\nglass.\n8.\nDEVITRIFICATION OF GLASS\nUnder certain conditions glass will become \"contaminated\" with crystalline particles. A\nglass in this condition is termed devitrified, which is simply another way of stating that it\nhas partially or completely crystallized. Devitrified glass, unless of the very special\nvariety that is deliberately produced, is undesirable since the crystalline areas form\nlarge crystals and are extremely weak and brittle, as well as being translucent only.\nCrystalline segregations in glass are known as stones.\n9.\nRECRYSTALLIZED GLASS (GLASS CERAMICS)\nRecrystallized glass, also known as polycrystalline glass, is commonly produced by\nadding nucleating agents to the glass batch. Subsequently the glass can be formed into\na desired shape by any of the conventional glass forming processes and then be\nheat-treated to promote recrystallization. Recrystallized glass possesses increased\nimpact strength, hardness and thermal shock resistance compared with conventional\n\nLN-7\nnon-crystalline glasses. One commonplace application of a recrystallized glass is in the\nmanufacture of the so-called refrigerator-to-oven cooking dishes.\n10. COLORED GLASSES\nWe recognize that glass is normally colorless due to the fact that all electrons are\n\"tightly bonded\" and no electronic excitations in the energy range of the visible light\nspectrum are possible. Glass, however, may be made to absorb selectively in the\nvisible spectrum (thus becoming colored) by any one of three processes:\n(1)\nAddition of ions of transition metals. Such ions provide electronic excitation\npossibilities to visible light. Typical ions added are:\nCr++\nblue\nCr+++\ngreen\nCo++\npink\nMn++\norange\nFe++\nblue-green\n(2)\nAddition of colloidal particles (φ 40 to 2000 A). These small particles, while not\nimpeding light transmission (because of their small size) exhibit selective\nabsorption and complementary reflection. Au particles (at 10-4 g/cm3) give colors\nwhich vary with particle size:\nAu φ 4-10 nm\npink\nAu φ 10-75 nm\nruby\nAu φ 75-110 nm\ngreen\nAu φ 110-170 nm\nbrown\n(3) Addition of colored crystals. Some glasses are colored by means of crystals\ndispersed throughout. An example is the scarlet glass made by the early\n\nLN-7\nEgyptians (brought about by the addition of red copper oxide). Another example is\nred color from the addition of red Pb2CrO6 whereas Cr2O3 yields green color.\n11. GLASS FIBER\nGlass fiber, or fiberglass* as it is commonly known, is glass in fiber form. It is made by\none of several processes, each of which involves the drawing out of the filaments from\nglass in the viscous state. Modern technical developments date from World War I when\nGermany had to find a substitute for asbestos as insulating material.\nThe process whereby continuous filament glass fiber is made is particularly interesting.\nThe glass batch is melted in the glass tank furnace and the molten glass is molded into\nordinary sized marbles. These marbles are fed into an electric furnace which has a\nplatinum-alloy bushing containing many tiny holes. When the glass marbles reach the\nholes, the glass flows through them and is drawn down vertically, forming individual\nfilaments. These filaments can then be twisted into a \"yarn\" and spun on normal textile\nspindles as required. About one third of an ounce of glass produces about one hundred\nmiles of filament at a rate of about 6,000 feet per minute.\nGlass wool, on the other hand, is produced by a different process. The most common\ntechnique, known as the Crown process, produces a thick matte of short glass fibers\nwhich are held together by a polymer binder. In the Crown method, a thick stream of\nmolten glass is poured into a rapidly rotating steel dish that has tiny vents around its\nperiphery. The glass is forced through these vents by centrifugal force, forming\nrelatively short fibers with diameters of about 0.0007 cm. The matte is then passed\nthrough curing ovens where the binder sets and is then cut into sizes suitable for\ninsulation.\n*Fiberglass is really a registered trade name.\n\nLN-7\n12. SHEET AND PLATE GLASS PRODUCTION\nThe main types of flat glass produced are drawn sheet and float glass. The processes\ninvolved are highly automated.\nFlat drawn glass is used for windows and other applications where accuracy of\nthickness and a high surface finish are not vital. In this process the molten glass is\ndrawn up vertically from the end of a large rectangular tank furnace, the thickness of\nthe drawn sheet being controlled principally by the size of the slot in the steel form held\njust above the surface of the molten glass. A steel starting dummy is used to\ncommence the drawing action, but this is cracked off once it passes through. Once\nstarted, this process is continuous, the cooled and solidified sheet merely being\ncracked off in suitable lengths once it leaves the rolls.\nThe float process is the most recent advance in the production of plate glass with a\nhigh surface finish. In the float process, flat, fire-finished, stress-free glass is formed by\npreventing contact between the glass sheet and anything solid. The glass leaves the\nglass-tank in a continuous molten strip and is floated immediately onto the surface of a\nbath of molten tin. The tin bath is surrounded by a non-oxidizing atmosphere and, while\nin this atmosphere, the glass is heated sufficiently to prevent the development of\ninternal stresses. As the glass sheet leaves the float bath chamber it enters an\nannealing furnace. Glass produced by the float process is free from distortion and has\nfire-finished surfaces that are smoother and flatter than those of normal polished plate\nglass.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n3.091SC Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

However, the rate of such collisions in solids, liquids and\ngases is so great that all reactions would be very rapid were it only necessary for\ncollisions to occur. \"Chemical\" reactions will not proceed more rapidly than molecular\ncollisions allow, but many reactions proceed much more slowly. It is thus apparent that\nnot every molecular collision leads to reaction. We have also seen from earlier\nexamples that the driving force for physical as well as chemical reactions is the (free)\nenergy change - which must be negative for reactions to occur spontaneously.\nHowever, while providing a \"go/no-go\" answer, this criterion alone cannot give us any\ninformation concerning the rate at which reactions occur, nor can it tell us which factors\ninfluence the reaction velocity.\nRates at which reactions occur vary considerably. For example, the nuclear reaction:\nU238 Th234\nis 50% completed (12)\nafter 5 x 109 years.\n12 5 x 109 years\n\nLN-8\nOn the other hand, the chemical reaction:\nSO\nH HSO\nis 50% completed after\nabout 10-4 s.\n3 x 104 seconds\nReaction kinetics (rate theory) deals to a large extent with the factors which influence\nthe reaction velocity. Take corrosion (rusting of iron), for example. We all know that it\nrequires air and water to provoke rusting and we also know, much to our sorrow, that\nrusting proceeds much more rapidly near the ocean where salt is present. We also\nknow that the rate of rusting depends strongly on the composition of iron (pure Fe and\nsteel corrode much less rapidly than cast iron, for example). It is primarily kinetic\nstudies which lead to the elucidation of chemical reactions and, in the case of corrosion,\nto the development of more corrosion resistant materials.\nThe principal experimental approach to the study of the reaction process involves the\nmeasurement of the rate at which a reaction proceeds and the determination of the\ndependence of this reaction rate on the concentrations of the reacting species and on\nthe temperature. These factors are grouped together in the term reaction kinetics and\nthe results for a given reaction are formulated in a rate equation which is of the general\nform:\nRate = k(T) x function of concentration of reactants\nThe quantity k(T) is called the rate constant and is a function only of the temperature if\nthe term involving the reactant concentrations correctly expresses the rate dependence\non concentration. Thus the experimental information on the reaction process is\nsummarized in the rate equation by the nature of the concentration function and by the\nvalue and temperature dependence of the rate constant.\n\nLN-8\n2.\nEXPERIMENTAL METHODS IN REACTION RATE STUDIES\nSince we know that chemical reactions are temperature dependent, kinetic\ninvestigations will require rigorous temperature control (thermostats). Furthermore, we\nhave to be able to observe and investigate concentration changes of reactions and\nproducts. For this purpose it frequently is customary to interrupt a reaction (for\nexample, by quenching - the abrupt lowering of temperature) and to make a chemical\nanalysis. In other instances, particularly for very fast reactions, a direct measurement of\nconcentration changes is physically impossible. In such cases it is necessary to\nquantitatively follow reactions indirectly, through the accompanying changes in specific\nphysical properties such as:\n(1)\nelectrical conductivity\n(2)\noptical absorption\n(3)\nrefractive index\n(4)\nvolume\n(5)\ndielectric constant\nas well as by other means. In the last twenty years, for example, the use of isotopes (as\n\"tracer\" elements) has become a valuable tool for the study of reaction kinetics (in slow\nreactions).\n3.\nCONCENTRATION DEPENDENCE OF REACTION RATES\nNormally experimental data of kinetic investigations are records of concentrations of\nreactants and/or products as a function of time for constant temperatures (taken at\nvarious temperatures).\nTheoretical expressions for reaction rates (involving concentration changes) are\ndifferential equations of the general form:\ndc f cm\n1 , cn\n2, co . . .\ndt\n\nLN-8\nwhere (c) are concentration terms which have exponents that depend on details of the\nreaction.\nIf we want to compare the theory with the experiment, it is therefore necessary to either\nintegrate the theoretical laws or to differentiate experimental concentration vs time data.\nThe rate laws are of importance since they provide analytical expressions for the\ncourse of individual reactions and enable us to calculate expected yields and optimum\nconditions for \"economic\" processes.\nIn most instances the differential rate equation is integrated before it is applied to the\nexperimental data.

It is\nfurthermore customary to\nconsider the time it takes\nto decrease the number\nof originally present\nspecies (normally called\nreactants) to 0.5 (by\n50%). We then talk about the half-life. Accordingly, the above equation can be\nreformulated as:\n\nLN-8\nk 2.3 x log c1 2.3 x log 2\nt12\nc1\nt12\nor:\nk 0.693\nt12\nThis means that from the half-life (t1/2) we may obtain the decay constant (rate constant\nin general). Vice versa, knowing the rate constant, we can calculate the time it takes to\ncomplete 50% of the reaction (or decay).\n4.\nREACTION ORDER\nReactions of first order, such as the decay of H2O2 or radioactive decay, do not require\nmolecular or atomic collisions - in principle they reflect inherent instability. A multitude of\nchemical reactions do involve collisions, however. For example, take the decay of HI:\n2HI H2 I2\nThe rate law for this reaction reflects the requirement of a collision in the concentration\nexponent:\nd[HI] k[HI] x [HI] k[HI]2\ndt\nThe reaction is referred to as a second order reaction which can readily be identified\nsince upon integration the rate law yields:\nkt const\n[HI]\nor, more generally:\n1 kt const\nc\nA plot of 1/c vs t will yield a straight line.\n\nLN-8\nIt is interesting to note that a determination of the reaction order from experimental data\nsupplies insight to the details of how molecules and atoms react with each other. Even\nthough rate data involve measurements of gross numbers of molecules, their\ninterpretation (through the reaction order) permits us to formulate the probable step (or\nsteps) which individual molecules undergo.\n5.\nTEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF REACTION RATES\nAlthough a chemical reaction may be \"thermodynamically\" favored (which means the\nfree energy of the system will be lowered as a result of the reaction), reaction may\nnevertheless not take place. Thus, H2 and O2 gases can exist in intimate contact over a\nconsiderable temperature range before reaction takes place. Nevertheless, a lighted\nmatch or a platinum powder catalyst can nucleate an immediate explosive reaction.\nAnother example with which we are familiar is glass: some glasses remain\n\"supercooled liquids\" for thousands of years at room temperature unless reheated to\nsome definite temperature for at least some minimum period of time. Many different\nfactors may influence the rate of a reaction - for example:\n(1)\nExisting interatomic (or intermolecular) bonds must be broken.\n(2)\nAtoms must be moved to and away from the reaction site.\n(3)\nA new boundary is required wherever a new \"phase\" is to be\nnucleated.\nAll three steps cited require work or a supply of energy. Furthermore, all three steps are\ntemperature dependent. At the beginning of this chapter we have stated:\nRate = k(T) x function of concentration of reactants\nIn other words: the reaction rate is proportional to the concentration of reactants. The\nproportionality constant k is a function of temperature k(T). The temperature\ndependence of k (which represents the temperature dependence of the rate of a given\nreaction) can be studied by performing experiments (with constant concentrations) at\n\nLN-8\ndifferent temperatures. From such experiments it can be seen that the value of the rate\nconstant (k) is much greater at higher temperatures - the reactions proceed faster.\nIn 1899 Arrhenius showed that the rate constant of reactions increased in an\nexponential manner with T. By an empirical procedure he found that a plot of log k\nversus 1/T gives a linear relation.\nRemember: In all kinetic and thermodynamic calculations it is mandatory to use the\n\"absolute temperature scale\" in Kelvin (K) which is given by:\nK = °C + 273.16\nThus 0K = -273.16 C, which corresponds to the thermodynamic absolute zero\ntemperature. Linear plots of log k vs 1/T imply the relation:\nln k 1\nT\nk econstT\nIn view of later deductions this empirical relation can be conveniently written as:\nk AeERT\nwhere A is a proportionality constant sometimes called the reaction constant, R is the\ngas constant and equals 8.31 J/mole K, E is the activation energy in Joules/mole and e\nis the base of the natural (Naperian) system of logarithms. Since ln x = 2.3 log10x, we\ncan rewrite the above equation:\nln k ln A E\nRT\nor\nlog k log A\nE\n2.3 x 8.3 x T\n\nLN-8\nlog k\nk1\nk2\nk3\nk4\nIf the above equation is\nobeyed, a plot of log k\nΔ log k\nE\nversus 1/T (fig. 6) will be a\n= -\nΔ (1\nT )\n2.3⋅ 8.31\nstraight line from which the\ncharacteristic activation\nenergy can be determined\nsince the slope is -E/19.15.\nThe reaction constant\n1/T1 1/T2 1/T3 1/T4\n1/T (K)\n(log A) may in turn be\nevaluated by extrapolating\nFigure 6 Arrhenius plot permitting the determination\nthe rate line to the point at\nof activation energies\nwhich 1/T equals zero.\nIt is important to realize that many reactions involve a succession of steps, in which\ncase the rate is controlled by the slowest step. The corresponding values of E and A\nmust be determined by experimental methods.\n6.\nTHE ARRHENIUS THEORY\nArrhenius developed a primarily qualitative theory for molecular reactions which led to\nempirical expressions for the rate constant. Later theories (which are beyond the scope\nof 3.091) elaborate and make these original ideas more quantitative.\nThe very simple (reversible) vapor-phase reaction of hydrogen and iodine to give\nhydrogen iodide can be used to illustrate the ideas of Arrhenius. The reaction\nH2 I2 2HI\napparently proceeds by a one-step (one collision) four-center process such that the\npath of the reaction can be depicted as follows:\n\nLN-8\nH2 + I2 →\n→\n→ 2HI\nH\nH\nI\nI\nH\nH\nI\nI\nFor more complicated systems, even when a mechanism has been postulated, it is not\nso easy to see how the electrons and atoms move around as the reaction proceeds.\nHowever, even Arrhenius recognized that any reaction process can proceed first by\nmeans of the formation of some \"high-energy species\" (which we now call the\n\"activated-complex\") and secondly by the breakdown of this complex into products.\nIf the activated-complex is assumed to have an energy, Ea, greater than the reactants,\nthen, in analogy to earlier considerations, the number of activated-complex molecules\ncompared with the number of reactant molecules can be written in terms of the\nBoltzmann distribution as:\n[activated complex molecules] eEaRT\n[reactant]\nThe rate of reaction thus becomes proportional to the concentration of\nactivated-complex molecules:\nRate ∝ (activated-complex molecules)\nor\nRate A x eEaRT x reactants\nMaking\nk AeEaRT\nwe find\nRate k [reactants]\nMoreover, the theory says that the empirical constant, Ea, is to be interpreted as the\nenergy of the activated-complex compared with that of the reactant molecules.\n\nLN-8\nThe idea of an activated-complex can be presented on a plot (fig. 7) of the energy of\nactivated complex\nEa\nHeat of reaction\nEnergy\nproducts\nreactants\nReaction coordinate\nFigure 7 Schematic of a reaction via activated complex formation\nthe system as ordinate versus the reaction coordinate as abscissa. The reaction\ncoordinate is not any single internuclear distance, but rather depends on all the\ninternuclear distances that change as the reactant molecules are converted into\nproduct molecules. In general it is impossible, and for the present purpose\nunnecessary, to give a quantitative description of the reaction coordinate. It consists of\nthe transformation from reactants to products.\nThe Arrhenius theory leads to a considerable improvement in our understanding of the\nreaction process. It is, however, still a very qualitative theory in that it does not show\nhow the pre-exponential factor A depends on the molecular properties of the reaction\nsystem, nor does it attempt to predict the value of Ea.\n7.\nTHE ACTIVATION ENERGY\nThe basic distribution of molecular (or atomic) energies at two different temperatures is\ngiven in fig. 8. It can be shown that eEaRT is the fraction of molecules or atoms having\n\nLN-8\nNE+dE\nT1 > T2\nT1\nT2\nn\nN = e - E\nRT\na\nEreactants\nEa\nFigure 8 Maxwell Boltzmann energy distribution\nan energy of Ea or greater. The Arrhenius equation holds only if the interacting species\nhave between them at least the certain critical energy Ea. Since the fraction having this\nenergy or greater is eEaRT, the reaction rate is proportional to this quantity.\nAs the value of Ea increases, the energy requirement increases and it becomes more\ndifficult for the molecules to acquire this energy. In contrast, eEaRT increases rapidly\nwith increasing temperature (T).\nThe change of a reaction rate with increasing temperature is usually much greater than\nexpected from the corresponding increase in the average velocity of molecules and\natoms. The average velocity of molecules and atoms is proportional to the square root\nof the absolute temperature. Thus, if the temperature is raised 10° from 298° to 308°,\nthe average velocity increase, (308/298)1/2, is but 2% whereas the rate of reaction\nincreases by about 100%. From this we must conclude that the reaction rate is\ncontrolled not only by the number of collisions, but also by the activation energy.\n\nLN-8\nWe now realize that in order for a reaction to proceed we have to supply activation\nenergy. We also know that for given conditions of concentration and T the rate of any\nreaction is inversely proportional to the energy of activation.\nSince, particularly in industry, time is a major factor which can make a process\neconomically feasible or unfeasible, considerable efforts have been put into\naccelerating reactions by means of catalysts. In catalytic reactions the \"catalyst\", which\neffectively lowers the required activation energy (fig. 9), is characterized by the\nfollowing criteria:\n(1)\nunchanged chemically at the end of a reaction;\n(2)\nrequired in small amounts only;\n(3)\ncatalytic action is frequently proportional to its surface area;\n(4)\ncatalysis can be selective: if different reactions are possible, catalysis can\nenhance the rate of either one without affecting the alternate reaction.\ncatalytic path\nEa\nEc\nfor catalytic reaction\nActivation energy\nEc = activation energy\nreaction coordinate\nFigure 9 Effect of catalysis on activation energy\nin chemical reaction.\n\nLN-8\nFor example:\nC2H5OH → H2C=CH2 + H2O\non γAlumina\n(important in polymer chemistry)\n(γAlumina: a cubic form of Al2O3)\nO\nC2H5OH → CH3 - C\n+ H2\non Copper\nH\nWhile the exact action of catalysis is still quite unclear, we do have some concrete\ninformation. The most frequently encountered case, heterogeneous catalysis (the\npresence of certain solids which increase gas reactions) is attributed to activation by\nadsorption. From infrared studies we know that upon adsorption of compounds the\nbonds within the compound are weakened and reactions can subsequently occur with\ndecreased activation energy.\nCatalysis has certainly had considerable impact on our daily life. Until 1940 gasoline\nwas exclusively made from crude oil. Also, possibly more important, nitrates and\nammonia came primarily from Chile (Chile saltpeter). In the Fischer-Tropsch process,\ncoal and steam are converted into gasoline hydrocarbons with the aid of Ni-Co\ncatalysts. The Haber-Bosch process, N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3 (ammonia) + 99 kJ, is likely\nthe most important catalytic reaction practiced: From the \"Le Chatelier\" principle (if in a\nreaction the number of molecules present decreases, the reaction can be accelerated\nby applying increased pressures) we know that high pressures will favor this synthesis,\nbut we also know that high temperature will favor the reverse reaction, i.e., decay of\nammonia; at high temperatures complex molecular structures tend to decay to more\nelemental, basic species. Catalysis (Fe, Al2O3 + K2O in solid form) makes it possible at\n400°C and at about 600 atm to convert about 60% of the gas mixture N2 + 3H2 to NH3.\nNitrates (important as fertilizers and explosives) are predominantly produced by\ncatalytic oxidation.\n\nLN-8\n4NH3 + 5O2 → 4NO + 6H2O\nover Pt at 900°C\n2NO + O2 → 2NO2\n3NO2 + H2O → 2HNO3 (nitric acid) + NO\nOther examples are:\n* SO2 + 1/2 O2 → SO3 over V2O5\n* Synthetic rubber from butadiene and styrene\n* Methanol from CO + 2H2 → CH3OH over ZnO + Cr2O3\nO\n* Formaldehyde from CH3OH → CH\nover Cu (important for plastics)\nH\n* In nature we have a large number of catalysts in the form of enzymes.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n3.091SC Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Since the movement of\nparticles is associated with collisions, the path of a single particle is a zigzag one.\nHowever, an aggregation of \"diffusing\" particles has an observable drift from places of\nhigher to places of lower concentration (fig. 1). For this reason diffusion is known as a\ntransport phenomenon.\nFigure 1 Mass transport, diffusion as a consequence\nof existing spacial differences in concentration.\nIn each diffusion reaction (heat flow, for example, is also a diffusion process), the flux\n(of matter, heat, electricity, etc.) follows the general relation:\n\nLN-9\nFlux = (conductivity) x (driving force)\nIn the case of atomic or molecular diffusion, the \"conductivity\" is referred to as the\ndiffusivity or the diffusion constant, and is represented by the symbol D. We realize\nfrom the above considerations that this diffusion constant (D) reflects the mobility of the\ndiffusing species in the given environment and accordingly assumes larger values in\ngases, smaller ones in liquids, and extremely small ones in solids.\nThe \"driving force\" for many types of\ndiffusion is the existence of a\nconcentration gradient. The term\nΔC/Δx → dC/dx\n\"gradient\" describes the variation of\na given property as a function of\ndistance in the x-direction. If a\nmaterial exhibits a linear variation of\nconcentration with distance in the\ndistance\nx-direction, we speak of a constant\nFigure 2 Concentration gradient (constant)\nconcentration gradient in the\nin the x direction\nΔC\nΔx\nconcentration\nx-direction. The gradient itself is the\nrate of change of the concentration with distance (dc/dx), which is the same as the\nslope of a graph of concentration vs. position (Δc/Δx) (see fig. 2).\nSteady State and Nonsteady Diffusion\nDiffusion processes may be divided into two types: (a) steady state and (b) nonsteady\nstate. Steady state diffusion takes place at a constant rate - that is, once the process\nstarts the number of atoms (or moles) crossing a given interface (the flux) is constant\nwith time. This means that throughout the system dc/dx = constant and dc/dt = 0.\n\nLN-9\nNonsteady state diffusion is a time dependent process in which the rate of diffusion is a\nfunction of time. Thus dc/dx varies with time and dc/dt = 0. Both types of diffusion are\ndescribed quantitatively by Fick's laws of diffusion. The first law concerns both steady\nstate and nonsteady state diffusion, while the second law deals only with nonsteady\nstate diffusion.\n2.\nSTEADY STATE DIFFUSION (FICK'S FIRST LAW)\nOn the basis of the above considerations, Fick's First Law may be formulated as:\nJ Ddc\ndx\nIn words: The diffusive flux is\nproportional to the\nexisting concentration\ngradient.\nThe negative sign in this relationship indicates that particle flow occurs in a \"down\"\ngradient direction, i.e. from regions of higher to regions of lower concentration. The flux\nJ can be given in units of atoms/cm2s, moles/cm2s, or equivalents. Correspondingly,\nthe diffusivity (D) will assume the dimensions cm2/s, as can be seen from a dimensional\nanalysis:\nJ moles D dc moles cm3\ncm2s\ndx\ncm\nThus: D = cm2/s\nLike chemical reactions, diffusion is a thermally activated process and the temperature\ndependence of diffusion appears in the diffusivity as an \"Arrhenius-type\" equation:\nD DoeEaRT\nwhere Do (the equivalent of A in the previously discussed temperature dependence of\nthe rate constant) includes such factors as the jump distance, the vibrational frequency\nof the diffusing species and so on. Selected values of D, Do and Ea are given in Table 1\n(a) and (b).\n\nLN-9\nTABLE 1\n(a)\nSelected Values of Diffusion Constants (D)\nDiffusing Substance\nSolvent\nT (°C)\nD (cm2.s-1)\nAu\nCu\n5 x 10-13\nCu (Self-Diffusing)\n(Cu)\n3.2 x 10-12\nC\nFe (FCC)\n10-7\nMethanol\nH2O\n1.4 x 10-5\nO2\nAir\n0.178\nH2\nAir\n0.611\n(b)\nSelected Values of Do and Ea for Diffusion Systems\nSolute\nSolvent\nDo,\nEa,\n(host structure)\ncm2s\nkJoules/mole\n1.\nCarbon\nfcc iron\n0.2100\n2.\nCarbon\nbcc iron\n0.0079\n3.\nIron\nfcc iron\n0.5800\n4.\nIron\nbcc iron\n5.8000\n5.\nNickel\nfcc iron\n0.5000\n6.\nManganese\nfcc iron\n0.3500\n7.\nZinc\ncopper\n0.0330\n8.\nCopper\naluminum\n2.0000\n9.\nCopper\ncopper\n11.0000\n10. Silver\nsilver\n0.7200\n\nLN-9\nA typical application of Fick's first law: Determine the rate at which helium (He), held at\n5 atm and 200°C in a Pyrex glass bulb of 50 cm diameter and a wall thickness (x) of\n0.1 cm, diffuses through the Pyrex to the outside. Assume that the pressure outside the\ntube at all times remains negligible (see fig. 3). (For the diffusion of gases it is\nHe\nP2 = 5 atm\n200oC\nP1 = 0 atm\nJ\nP2\nP1\nΔx\nJ = - K ΔP / Δx\nFigure 3 Conditions for outdiffusion of He from a glass bulb.\ncustomary, although not necessary, to replace the diffusion constant D with the\nPermeation constant K, normally given in units of cm2/s.atm. Using the gas laws, K is\nreadily converted to D if so desired.)\nIn the present system\nK = 1 x 10-9 cm2/s.atm\nWe can now set up the diffusion equation:\nJ KdP\n(and operate with pressures instead\ndx\nof concentrations)\nWe may now formally separate the variables and integrate:\nJdx = -KdP\nx0.1\np10\n\nJdx\nKdP\nx0\np25\nJ K 5.0\n0.1\nWe can forego the integration since (dP/dx) = (ΔP/Δx) and we may immediately write:\n\nLN-9\nJ (total) K P x A 5 x 108 x 7.9 x 103\nx\nJ = 3.9 x 10-4 ??\nThe units of the flux may be obtained from a dimensional analysis:\nJ K x P x A cm2\natm cm2\nx\ns atm\ncm\ncm3\ns\nThe total flux is 3.9 x 10-4 cm3/s (with the gas volume given for 0°C and 1 atm). If the\ntotal gas flow by diffusion were to be determined for a specified time interval, the\nvolume would be multiplied by the indicated time.\n3.\nNONSTEADY STATE DIFFUSION (FICK'S SECOND LAW)\nThe quantitative treatment of nonsteady state diffusion processes is formulated as a\npartial differential equation. It is beyond the scope of 3.091 to treat the equations in\ndetail but we can consider the second law qualitatively and examine some relevant\nsolutions quantitatively.\nThe difference between steady state and nonsteady state diffusion conditions can\nreadily be visualized (fig. 4). In the first case we have, for example, the diffusion of gas\nSteady state diffusion\nNon-steady state diffusion\np1= const.\np2 = const.\nJ = - K Δp/Δx\nΔx\np1\np2\nΔx\nJ\nmembrane\nΔp/Δx = constant\nΔp/Δx = f (time)\nFigure 4 Steady state and Non-steady state diffusion\nfrom an infinite volume (P1 const) through a membrane into an infinite volume (P2\nconst). The pressure gradient across the membrane remains constant as does the\n\nLN-9\ndiffusive flux. In the second case we deal with diffusion from a finite volume through a\nmembrane into a finite volume. The pressures in the reservoirs involved change with\ntime as does, consequently, the pressure gradient across the membrane.\n(You are not required to be familiar with the following derivation of the Second Fick's\nLaw, but you must know its final form.)\nConsider a volume element (between x and\nJx\nJx+dx\nx+dx of unit cross sectional area) of a\nC\nmembrane separating two finite volumes\nx\nx+dx\ninvolved in a diffusion system (fig. 5). The\nFigure 5\nx\nflux of a given material into the volume\nelement minus the flux out of the volume\nelement equals the rate of accumulation of the material into this volume element:\nJx Jxdx c dx\nt\n[c is the average concentration in the volume element and cdx is the total amount of the\ndiffusing material in the element at time (t).]\nUsing a Taylor series we can expand Jx+dx about x and obtain:\nJxdx Jx Jx\nx dx 2Jx\nx2\ndx2\n...\nAccordingly, as dx → 0:\n\nx D c\ndx c\nt\nand if D does not vary with x (which is normally the case) we have the formulation of\nFick's Second Law:\nc D 2c\n(Ficks Second Law)\nt\nx2\n\nLN-9\nIn physical terms this relationship states that the rate of compositional change is\nproportional to the \"rate of change\" of the concentration gradient rather than to the\nconcentration gradient itself.\nThe solutions to Fick's second law depend on the boundary conditions imposed by the\nparticular problem of interest. As an example, let us consider the following problem\n(encountered in many solid state processes):\nA frequently encountered situation is the diffusion of a component 2 into an infinite\nregion of a material 1 (fig. 6) [planar diffusion of doping elements into semiconductors\nc2, supplied through the gas phase\nremains constant\nc2\nconc. of component 2\nc = f (t,x)\n'\nx\nSolid (1)\n(a)\nc2\nconc. of comp.2\nSolid\nx\nc = c2 erfc x / 2 Dt\n(b)\nc2\nc2' = 0\nFigure 6 Diffusion at constant surface concentration ; bulk concentration of component\n2 at start of diffusion is c2' (in a) and is zero (in b).\nfor the generation of junction devices (p-n junctions, junction transistors)]. The\nboundary conditions are: the concentration of component (2) at the surface of the solid\nphase (x=0) remains constant at c2 and the concentration of component (2) in the solid\nprior to diffusion is uniformly c2′ (a). Under these boundary conditions the solution to\nFick's second law assumes the form:\nc2 c\nerf x\nc2 c2\n2 Dt\n\nLN-9\nIf no component (2) is originally in the solid matrix (1) (b), the above solution is simpler:\nc2 c erf x\nc2\n\n2 Dt\nc\nerf x\nc2\n\n2 Dt\nc 1 erf x\nc2\n\n2 Dt\nc erfc x\nc2\n\n2 Dt\nc c2 erfc x\n2 Dt\nAn analysis shows that the last form of the solution to Fick's law relates the\nconcentration (c) at any position (x) (depth of penetration into the solid matrix) and time\n(t) to the surface concentration (c2) and the diffusion constant (D). The terms erf and\nerfc stand for error function and complementary error function respectively - it is the\nGaussian error function as tabulated (like trigonometric and exponential functions) in\nmathematical tables. Its limiting values are:\nerf (0)\n=\nerf (inf)\n=\nAnd for the complementary error function:\nerf (-inf) =\n-1\nerfc = (1 - erf)\nAnother look at the above solution to the diffusion equation shows that the\nconcentration (c) of component (2) in the solid is expressed in terms of the error\nfunction of the argument x2 Dt. To determine at what depth a particular concentration\n(c*) of (2) will appear, we substitute this concentration for (c) and obtain:\nc * erfc x K\nc2\n2 Dt\nSince the error function is a constant, its argument must also be a constant:\n\nLN-9\nc2\ncx\nconc. of component 2\nSolid (1)\nx\nx\nc*\nFigure 7 Advance of the concentration front (c*)\nas a function of trime\nt1\nt2\nt3\nx\nK\n2 Dt\nTherefore, under the given boundary conditions:\nx K 2 Dt\nx K Dt\nx t\nThe depth of penetration of a specified concentration is found to be proportional to the\nsquare root of the time of diffusion.\n4.\nSELF-DIFFUSION\nAs previously indicated, the thermal motion of atoms in a lattice is a random process\nand as such will lead to local displacements of individual atoms. This random\nmovement of atoms within a lattice (self-diffusion), which is not associated with any\nexisting concentration gradients, can be readily demonstrated with the aid of\n\"radioactive elements\". For example, nickel appears in nature in the form of several\n\"stable isotopes\":\n\nLN-9\nNi58, Ni60, Ni61, Ni62 and Ni64\nIf Ni58 is irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, it will capture a neutron and\nbecome Ni59 which is radioactive (a radio-isotope).\nNi58\n28 Co59\n28 n Ni59\nNickel 59 is characterized by its instability which leads to the emission of β and γ\nradiation, with a half-life of 8 x 104 years. Since this radiation can be measured by\nappropriate radiation detectors, it is possible to use Ni59 as a \"tracer element\" for\nstudies of self-diffusion.\nThe radioactive nickel (which is identical to ordinary nickel with the exception of its\nradioactive properties) is electroplated onto normal nickel. This specimen is\nsubsequently placed into a furnace and heated up to close to its melting point for an\nextended period of time. After removing the specimen, it is sectioned into slices parallel\nto the surface which contained the radioactive tracer element. With the aid of a\nradiation detector it can now be shown that the Ni59, which originally was only at the\nsurface, has diffused into the bulk material while simultaneously some bulk nickel has\ncounter-diffused in the other direction. If this sample is heat-treated for a much longer\ntime, sectioning and counting will reveal a completely uniform distribution of the\nradio-tracer element. It can thus be shown that self-diffusion does occur in solids, and\nquantitative measurements with tracer elements even permit the determination of\nself-diffusion coefficients.\n5.\nDIFFUSION MECHANISMS\nThe diffusion process in interstitial solid solutions, like that of carbon in iron, can readily\nbe understood as a result of considerable differences in atomic diameters. However,\nthe fact that Au diffuses faster in Pb than NaCl diffuses in water at 15°C cannot be\nreadily explained. The magnitude of the observed activation energy indicates that a\n\nLN-9\nmechanism whereby atoms simply change places with each other has to be excluded.\nMore reasonable mechanisms were suggested by Frenkel and Schottky. They\nproposed the existence of point defects (vacancies) in crystals which provide a\nmechanism by which atoms can move (diffuse) within a crystal. The concentration of\nsuch vacancies, as you recall, can be calculated from simple statistical calculations.\nIn most solids we are not dealing with single crystals but rather with polycrystalline\nmaterials which contain a large number of grain boundaries (internal surfaces). As\nexpected, the rate of diffusion along grain boundaries is much higher than that for\nvolume diffusion (Dvolume < Dg-boundary). FInally, surface diffusion, which takes place on\nall external surfaces, is even higher (Dvolume < Dg-boundary < Dsurface). The respective\nactivation energies for diffusion are:\nEa surface < Ea grain boundary < Ea volume\nDiffusion in Non-Metals\nIn non-metallic systems diffusion takes place by the same mechanisms as in metallic\nsystems. Oxygen, for example, diffuses through many oxides by vacancy migration. In\ncrystalline oxides and in silicate glasses as well, it is found that oxygen diffuses much\nmore rapidly than the metallic ion. In glasses containing alkali atoms (Na+, K+), the\nrespective rates of diffusion are:\nDalkali > Doxygen > Dsilicon\ncorresponding to differences in bonding strengths. In polymer materials diffusion\nrequires the motion of large molecules since intramolecular bonding is much stronger\nthan intermolecular bonding. This fact explains that the diffusion rates in such materials\nare relatively small.\nGaseous Diffusion in Solids\nSome gases, like hydrogen and helium, diffuse through some metals with ease even at\nroom temperature. Helium, for example, will diffuse through quartz and steel and limits\n\nLN-9\nthe ultimate vacuum obtainable in ultra-high vacuum systems. Hydrogen similarly\ndiffuses readily through Ni at elevated temperatures. H2 also diffuses at high rates\nthrough palladium - a phenomenon which is used extensively for hydrogen purification\nsince that material is impervious to other gases.\n\nLN-9\nTABLE 2\nThe Error Function\nz\nerf(z)\nz\nerf(z)\n0.85\n0.7707\n0.025\n0.0282\n0.90.\n0.7970\n0.05\n0.0564\n0.95\n0.8209\n0.10\n0.1125\n1.0\n0.8427\n0.15\n0.1680\n1.1\n0.8802\n0.20\n0.2227\n1.2\n0.9103\n0.25\n0.2763\n1.3\n0.9340\n0.30\n0.3286\n1.4\n0.9523\n0.35\n0.3794\n1.5\n0.9661\n0.40\n0.4234\n1.6\n0.9763\n0.45\n0.4755\n1.7\n0.9838\n0.50\n0.5205\n1.8\n0.9891\n0.55\n0.5633\n1.9\n0.9928\n0.60\n0.6039\n2.0\n0.9953\n0.65\n0.6420\n2.2\n0.9981\n0.70\n0.6778\n2.4\n0.9993\n0.75\n0.7112\n2.6\n0.9998\n0.80\n0.7421\n2.8\n0.9999\nSOURCE: The values of erf(z) to 15 places, in increments of z of 0.0001, can be found\nin the Mathematical Tables Project, \"Table of Probability Functions . . .\", vol. 1, Federal\nWorks Agency, Works Projects Administration, New York, 1941.

They provide us with the knowledge of\nphase composition and phase stability as a function of temperature (T), pressure (P)\nand composition (C). Furthermore, they permit us to study and control important\nprocesses such as phase separation, solidification, sintering, purification, growth and\ndoping of single crystals for technological and other applications. Although phase\ndiagrams provide information about systems at equilibrium, they can also assist in\npredicting phase relations, compositional changes and structures in systems not at\nequilibrium.\n1.\nGASES, LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS\nAny material (elemental or compound) can exist as a gas, a liquid or a solid, depending\non the relative magnitude of the attractive interatomic or intermolecular forces vs the\ndisruptive thermal forces. It is thus clear that the stability (existence) of the different\n\nLN-10\nstates of aggregation, which are referred to as phases, is a function of temperature and\npressure (since with increased pressure the atoms, for exampled of a gas phase, are\ncloser spaced and thus subject to increased interatomic attraction).\nIn general terms, a \"phase\" is a homogeneous, physically distinct, mechanically\nseparable portion of a material with a given chemical composition. To illustrate this\ndefinition, let us look at a few examples of common multi-phase systems. Ice cubes in\nwater constitute a two-phase system (ice and liquid water), unless we include the vapor\nabove the glass in our system, which would make it a three-phase system. A mixture of\noil and water would also be a two-phase system. Just as oil and water represent two\ndistinct liquid phases, two regions of a solid with distinctly different composition or\nstructure separated by boundaries represent two solid phases.\nIf we look at a one-component system, such as liquid water, we recognize that because\nof the energy distribution of the water molecules, some water molecules will always\npossess sufficient energy to overcome the attractive forces on the surface of H2O and\nenter into the gas phase. If thermal energy is continuously supplied to a liquid in an\nopen container, the supply of high energy molecules (which leave the liquid phase) is\nreplenished and the temperature remains constant - otherwise the loss of high energy\nmolecules will lower the temperature of the system. The total quantity of heat\nnecessary to completely \"vaporize\" one mole of a liquid at its boiling point is called its\nmolar heat of vaporization, designated by ΔHV. Similarly, the heat required to\ncompletely melt one mole of a solid (the heat required to break the bonds established in\nthe solid phase) is called the (latent) heat of fusion (ΔHV).\nVisualize a liquid in a sealed container with some space above the liquid surface.\nAgain, some of the most energetic liquid molecules will leave the liquid phase and form\na \"gas phase\" above the liquid. Since gas molecules will thus accumulate in the gas\nphase (at a constant temperature), it is inevitable that as a result of collisions in the gas\n\nLN-10\nphase some molecules will re-enter the liquid phase and a situation will be established\nwhereby the rate of evaporation will equal the rate of condensation - i.e., a dynamic\nequilibrium between the liquid and gas phase will exist. The established pressure in the\ngas phase is referred to as the equilibrium vapor pressure, which is normally\nsignificantly less for solids than for liquids.\nFor obvious reasons it is desirable to know for any given material the conditions (P, T)\nunder which the solid state, the liquid state and the gaseous state are stable, as well as\nthe conditions under which the solid and liquid phases may coexist. These conditions\nare graphically presented in equilibrium phase diagrams, which can be experimentally\ndetermined.\n2.\nTHE ONE-COMPONENT PHASE DIAGRAM\nFigure 1 illustrates the temperatures and pressures at which water can exist as a solid,\nliquid or vapor. The curves represent the points at which two of the phases coexist in\nequilibrium. At the point Tt vapor, liquid and solid coexist in equilibrium. In the fields of\nthe diagram (phase fields) only one phase exists. Although a diagram of this kind\ndelineates the boundaries of the phase fields, it does not indicate the quantity of any\nphase present.\nIt is of interest to consider the slope of the liquid/solid phase line of the H2O phase\ndiagram. It can readily be seen that if ice - say at -2°C - is subjected to high\npressures, it will transform to liquid H2O. (An ice skater will skate not on ice, but on\nwater.) This particular pressure sensitivity (reflected in the slope of the solid/liquid\nphase line) is characteristic for materials which have a higher coordination number in\nthe liquid than in the solid phase (H2O, Bi, Si, Ge). Metals, for example have an\nopposite slope of the solid/liquid phase line, and the liquid phase will condense under\npressure to a solid phase.\n\nLN-10\nFig. 1\nPressure/Temperature Diagram for Water. (Not drawn to scale.)\n3.\nPHASE RULE AND EQUILIBRIUM\nThe phase rule, also known as the Gibbs phase rule, relates the number of\ncomponents and the number of degrees of freedom in a system at equilibrium by the\nformula\nF = C - P + 2\n[1]\nwhere F equals the number of degrees of freedom or the number of independent\nvariables, C equals the number of components in a system in equilibrium and P equals\nthe number of phases. The digit 2 stands for the two variables, temperature and\npressure.\nPhase diagram for wa\nter, highligh\nting\nthe trip\nle po\nint (6\nx 10\n-3\natm an\nd 0.009\n8 deg\nC) and critical\npoint (217\n.\n7 atm\nand 374.4 deg\nC).\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nLN-10\nThe number of degrees of freedom of a system is the number of variables that may be\nchanged independently without causing the appearance of a new phase or\ndisappearance of an existing phase. The number of chemical constituents that must be\nspecified in order to describe the composition of each phase present. For example, in\nthe reaction involving the decomposition of calcium carbonate on heating, there are\nthree phases - two solid phases and one gaseous phase.\nCaCO3 (s) CaO (s) + CO2 (g)\n[2]\nThere are also three different chemical constituents, but the number of components is\nonly two because any two constituents completely define the system in equilibrium. Any\nthird constituent may be determined if the concentration of the other two is known.\nSubstituting into the phase rule (eq. [1]) we can see that the system is univariant, since\nF = C - P + 2 = 2 - 3 + 2 = 1. Therefore only one variable, either temperature or\npressure, can be changed independently. (The number of components is not always\neasy to determine at first glance, and it may require careful examination of the physical\nconditions of the system at equilibrium.)\nThe phase rule applies to dynamic and reversible processes where a system is\nheterogeneous and in equilibrium and where the only external variables are\ntemperature, pressure and concentration. For one-component systems the maximum\nnumber of variables to be considered is two - pressure and temperature. Such systems\ncan easily be represented graphically by ordinary rectangular coordinates. For\ntwo-component (or binary) systems the maximum number of variables is three -\npressure, temperature and concentration. Only one concentration is required to define\nthe composition since the second component is found by subtracting from unity. A\ngraphical representation of such a system requires a three-dimensional diagram. This,\nhowever, is not well suited to illustration and consequently separate two-coordinate\ndiagrams, such as pressure vs temperature, pressure vs composition and temperature\n\nLN-10\nvs composition, are mostly used. Solid/liquid systems are usually investigated at\nconstant pressure, and thus only two variables need to be considered - the vapor\npressure for such systems can be neglected. This is called a condensed system and\nfinds considerable application in studying phase equilibria in various engineering\nmaterials. A condensed system will be represented by the following modified phase rule\nequation:\nF = C - P + 1\n[3]\nwhere all symbols are the same as before, but (because of a constant pressure) the\ndigit 2 is replaced by the digit 1, which stands for temperature as variable. The\ngraphical representation of a solid/liquid binary system can be simplified by\nrepresenting it on ordinary rectangular coordinates: temperature vs concentration or\ncomposition.\n4.\nH vs T PHASE DIAGRAM\nWith the aid of a suitable calorimeter and energy reservoir, it is possible to measure the\nheat required to melt and evaporate a pure substance like ice. The experimental data\nobtainable for a mole of ice is shown schematically in fig. 2. As heat is added to the\nsolid, the temperature rises along line \"a\" until the temperature of fusion (Tf) is reached.\nThe amount of heat absorbed per mole during melting is represented by the length of\nline \"b\", or ΔHF. The amount of heat absorbed per mole during evaporation at the\nboiling point is represented by line \"d\". The reciprocal of the slope of line \"a\", (dH/dT), is\nthe heat required to change the temperature of one mole of substance (at constant\npressure) by 1°CF. (dH/dT) is the molar heat capacity of a material, referred to as \"Cp\".\nAs the reciprocal of line \"a\" is Cp (solid), the reciprocals of lines \"c\" and \"e\" are\nCp (liquid) and Cp (vapor) respectively.\n\nLN-10\nFig. 2\nH vs T Diagram for Pure H2O. (Not to scale.)\nFrom a thermodynamic standpoint, it is important to realize that fig. 2 illustrates the\nenergy changes that occur in the system during heating. Actual quantitative\nmeasurements show that 5.98 kJ of heat are absorbed at the melting point (latent heat\nof fusion) and 40.5 kJ per mole (latent heat of evaporation) at the boiling point. The\nlatent heats of fusion and evaporation are unique characteristics of all pure substances.\nSubstances like Fe, Co, Ti and others, which are allotropic (exhibit different structures\nat different temperatures), also exhibit latent heats of transformation as they change\nfrom one solid state crystal modification to another.\n5.\nENERGY CHANGES\nWhen heat is added from the surroundings to a material system (as described above),\nthe energy of the system changes. Likewise, if work is done on the surroundings by the\nmaterial system, its energy changes. The difference in energy (ΔE) that the system\n\nLN-10\nexperiences must be the difference between the heat absorbed (Q) by the system and\nthe work (W) done on the surroundings. The energy change may therefore be written\nas:\nΔE = Q - W\n[4]\nIf heat is liberated by the system, the sign of Q is negative and work done is positive. Q\nand W depend on the direction of change, but ΔE does not. The above relation is one\nway of representing the First Law of Thermodynamics which states that the energy of\na system and its surroundings is always conserved while a change in energy of the\nsystem takes place. The energy change, ΔE, for a process is independent of the path\ntaken in going from the initial to the final state.\nIn the laboratory most reactions and phase changes are studied at constant pressure.\nThe work is then done solely by the pressure (P), acting through the volume change,\nΔV.\nW = PΔV\nand\nΔP = 0\n[5]\nHence:\nQ = ΔE + PΔV\n[6]\nSince the heat content of a system, or the enthalpy H, is defined by:\nH = E + PV\n[7]\nΔH = ΔE + PΔV\n[8]\nso that:\nΔH = Q - W + PΔV\n[9]\nor\nΔH = Q\n[10]\nReactions in which ΔH is negative are called exothermic since they liberate heat,\nwhereas endothermic reactions absorb heat. Fusion is an endothermic process, but the\nreverse reaction, crystallization, is an exothermic one.\n\nLN-10\n6.\nENTROPY AND FREE ENERGY\nWhen a gas condenses to form a liquid and a liquid freezes to form a crystalline solid,\nthe degree of internal order increases. Likewise, atomic vibrations decrease to zero\nwhen a perfect crystal is cooled to 0°K. Since the term entropy, designated by S, is\nconsidered a measure of the degree of disorder of a system, a perfect crystal at 0°K\nhas zero entropy.\nThe product of the absolute temperature, T, and the change in entropy, ΔS, is called the\nentropy factor, TΔS. This product has the same units (Joules/mole) as the change in\nenthalpy, ΔH, of a system. At constant pressure, P, the two energy changes are related\nto one another by the Gibbs free energy relation:\nΔF = ΔH - TΔS\n[11]\nwhere\nF = H - TS\n[12]\nThe natural tendency exhibited by all materials systems is to change from one of higher\nto one of lower free energy. Materials systems also tend to assume a state of greater\ndisorder whereby the entropy factor TΔS is increased. The free energy change, ΔF,\nexpresses the balance between the two opposing tendencies, the change in heat\ncontent (ΔH) and the change in the entropy factor (TΔS).\nIf a system at constant pressure is in an equilibrium state, such as ice and water at 0°C,\nfor example, at atmospheric pressure it cannot reach a lower energy state. At\nequilibrium in the ice-water system, the opposing tendencies, ΔH and TΔS, equal one\nanother so that ΔF = 0. At the fusion temperature, TF:\nHF\nSF\n[13]\nTF\nSimilarly, at the boiling point:\n\nH\nS\n\nV\nV\n\n[14]\nTV\nThus melting or evaporation only proceed if energy is supplied to the system from the\nsurroundings.\nThe entropy of a pure substance at constant pressure increases with temperature\naccording to the expression:\nCpT\nS\n(since : H CpT)\n[15]\nT\nwhere Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure, ΔCp, ΔH, T and ΔT are all\nmeasurable quantities from which ΔS and ΔF can be calculated.\n7.\nF vs T\nAny system can change spontaneously if the accompanying free energy change is\nLN-10\nnegative. This may be shown graphically by making use of F vs T curves such as those\nshown in fig. 3.\nFig. 3\nFree energy is a function of temperature for ice and water.\n\nLN-10\nThe general decrease in free energy of all the phases with increasing temperature is\nthe result of the increasing dominance of the temperature-entropy term. The\nincreasingly negative slope for phases which are stable at increasingly higher\ntemperatures is the result of the greater entropy of these phases.\nPART B: PHASE DIAGRAMS (TWO-COMPONENT SYSTEMS)\n1.\nSOLID SOLUTIONS\nA solution can be defined as a homogeneous mixture in which the atoms or molecules\nof one substance are dispersed at random into another substance. If this definition is\napplied to solids, we have a solid solution. The term \"solid solution\" is used just as\n\"liquid solution\" is used because the solute and solvent atoms (applying the term\nsolvent to the element in excess) are arranged at random. The properties and\ncomposition of a solid solution are, however, uniform as long as it is not examined at\nthe atomic or molecular level.\nSolid solutions in alloy systems may be of two kinds: substitutional and interstitial. A\nsubstitutional solid solution results when the solute atoms take up the positions of the\nsolvent metal in the crystal lattice. Solid solubility is governed by the comparative size\nof the atoms of the two elements, their structure and the difference in electronegativity.\nIf the atomic radii of a solvent and solute differ by more than 15% of the radius of the\nsolvent, the range of solubility is very small. When the atomic radii of two elements are\nequal or differ by less than 15% in size and when they have the same number of\nvalency electrons, substitution of one kind of atom for another may occur with no\ndistortion or negligible distortion of the crystal lattice, resulting in a series of\nhomogeneous solid solutions. For an unlimited solubility in the solid state, the radii of\nthe two elements must not differ by more than 8% and both the solute and the solvent\nelements must have the same crystal structure.\n\nLN-10\nIn addition to the atomic size factor, the solid solution is also greatly affected by the\nelectronegativity of elements and by the relative valency factor. The greater the\ndifference between electronegativities, the greater is the tendency to form compounds\nand the smaller is the solid solubility. Regarding valency effect, a metal of lower valency\nis more likely to dissolve a metal of higher valency. Solubility usually increases with\nincreasing temperature and decreases with decreasing temperature. This causes\nprecipitation within a homogeneous solid solution phase, resulting in hardening effect of\nan alloy. When ionic solids are considered, the valency of ions is a very important\nfactor.\n2.\nCONSTRUCTION OF EQUILIBRIUM PHASE DIAGRAMS\nOF TWO-COMPONENT SYSTEMS\nTo construct an equilibrium phase diagram of a binary system, it is a necessary and\nsufficient condition that the boundaries of one-phase regions be known. In other words,\nthe equilibrium diagram is a plot of solubility relations between components of the\nsystem. It shows the number and composition of phases present in any system under\nequilibrium conditions at any given temperature. Construction of the diagram is often\nbased on solubility limits determined by thermal analysis - i.e., using cooling curves.\nChanges in volume, electrical conductivity, crystal structure and dimensions can also be\nused in constructing phase diagrams.\nThe solubility of two-component (or binary) systems can range from essential\ninsolubility to complete solubility in both liquid and solid states, as mentioned above.\nWater and oil, for example, are substantially insoluble in each other while water and\n\nLN-10\nalcohol are completely intersoluble. Let us visualize an experiment on the water-ether\nsystem in which a series of mixtures of water and ether in various proportions is placed\nin test tubes. After shaking the test tubes vigorously and allowing the mixtures to settle,\nwe find present in them only one phase of a few percent of ether in water or water in\nether, whereas for fairly large percentages of either one in the other there are two\nphases. These two phases separate into layers, the upper layer being ether saturated\nwith water and the lower layers being water saturated with ether. After sufficiently\nincreasing the temperature, we find, regardless of the proportions of ether and water,\nthat the two phases become one. If we plot solubility limit with temperature as ordinate\nand composition as abscissa, we have an isobaric [constant pressure (atmospheric in\nthis case)] phase diagram, as shown in fig. 4. This system exhibits a solubility gap.\nFig. 4\nSchematic representation of the solubilities of ether and water in each other.\nG\nra\nph\no\nf\ncom\nposition percentage water\nand\ne\nth\ner\nv\ns\n. temperature.

Used with permission.\n\nLN-10\n5.\nINTERPRETATION OF PHASE DIAGRAMS\nFrom the above discussion we can draw two useful conclusions which are the only\nrules necessary for interpreting equilibrium diagrams of binary systems.\nRule 1 - Phase composition: To determine the composition of phases which are\nstable at a given temperature we draw a horizontal line at the given temperature. The\nprojections (upon the abscissa) of the intersections of the isothermal line with the\nliquidus and the solidus give the compositions of the liquid and solid, respectively, which\ncoexist in equilibrium at that temperature. For example, draw a horizontal temperature\nline through temperature Te in fig. 7. The Te line intersects the solidus at f and the\nliquidus at g, indicating solid composition of f% of B and (100-f)% of A. The liquid\ncomposition at this temperature is g% of B and (100-g)% of A. This line in a two-phase\nregion is known as a tie line because it connects or \"ties\" together lines of one-fold\nsaturation - i.e., the solid is saturated with respect to B and the liquid is saturated with\nrespect to A.\nRule 2 - The Lever Rule: To determine the relative amounts of the two phases, erect\nan ordinate at a point on the composition scale which gives the total or overall\ncomposition of the alloy. The intersection of this composition vertical and a given\nisothermal line is the fulcrum of a simple lever system. The relative lengths of the lever\narms multiplied by the amounts of the phase present must balance. As an illustration,\nconsider alloy in fig. 7. The composition vertical is erected at alloy with a\ncomposition of e% of B and (100-e)% of A. This composition vertical intersects the\ntemperature horizontal (Te) at point e. The length of the line \"f-e-g\" indicates the total\namount of the two phases present. The length of line \"e-g\" indicates the amount of\n\nLN-10\nsolid. In other words:\neg x 100 % of solid present\nfg\nfg x 100 % of liquid present\nfg\nThese two rules give both the composition and the relative quantity of each phase\npresent in a two-phase region in any binary system in equilibrium regardless of physical\nform of the two phases. The two rules apply only to two-phase regions.\n6.\nISOMORPHOUS SYSTEMS\nAn isomorphous system is one in which there is complete intersolubility between the\ntwo components in the vapor, liquid and solid phases, as shown in fig. 9. The Cu-Ni\nsystem is both a classical and a practical example since the monels, which enjoy\nextensive commercial use, are Cu-Ni alloys. Many practical materials systems are\nisomorphous.\nFig. 9\nSchematic phase diagram for a binary system, A-B, showing complete\nintersolubility (isomorphism) in all phases.\n\nLN-10\n7.

According to the Pauli exclusion principle, each \"molecular orbital\" formed in\nthe band (energy state) can accommodate two electrons.

The material will not be\na good conductor. (There are additional factors which contribute to the relatively\npoor conductivity of Ge at this temperature.)\n\nProblem #6\n\nIf no electron-hole pairs were produced in germanium (Ge) until the temperature\nreached the value corresponding to the energy gap, at what temperature would Ge\nbecome conductive?

Explain your answer.\n\n(b) How do you expect the conductivity to vary in a metallic conductor with increasing\ntemperature?\n\nSolution\n\n(a) From our limited knowledge of the conduction behavior, we must assume that in\nsemiconductors the conductivity will increase with T since the number of electrons in\nthe conduction band increases.\n\n(b) As a first approximation, we can say that the number of free electrons is\nindependent of T; that, however, the atoms in the lattice will, with increasing\ntemperature, be subject to increased oscillations about their (relatively) fixed\nposition. These oscillations provide greater opportunity for \"scattering\" of conducting\nelectrons and thus will \"reduce\" the mobility of the electrons. We can expect the\nelectrical conductivity of metals to decrease with increasing temperature.\n\nProblem #8\n\nThe energy gap (Eg) of ZnSe is 2.3 eV.\n\n(a) Is this material transparent to visible radiation? Substantiate your answer.\n\n(b) How could you increase the electrical conductivity of this material? Give the reasons\nfor the effectiveness of your suggested approach.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) The optical properties of ZnSe can be explained when comparing the energy band of\nthe visible spectrum with the energy band diagram of ZnSe. Absorption takes place\nvia photoexcitation for all radiation with E ≥ 2.3 eV.\n\nFrom the energy distribution of the visible spectrum we recognize that the blue-\ngreen portion has photon energies in excess of the band gap (Eg = 2.3eV) and thus\nwill be absorbed. The yellow-red potion, on the other hand, has photon energies less\nthan the band gap - it will be transmitted. ZnSe, therefore, is expected to exhibit a\nyellowish-red color.\n\n(b) In principle there are two ways to increase the electrical conductivity of ZnSe:\n\na. A temperature rise. Any rise in temperature will increase the number of\n\"thermally activated\" charge carriers in the conduction band (electrons) and\nin the valence band (holes) and, thus, the electronic conductivity.\n\nAside: The electrical conductivity of solids, demonstrated by the flow of\nelectronic charge carriers under an applied electric field (E), can be\nformulated through Ohm's law, J = σE, which states that the current density\n(J = number of charges transported through a unit area in a unit time) is\nproportional (σ = conductivity) to the applied electric field. Accordingly:\n\nd\nJ = N e v\n\nwhere N = number of charge carriers/unit volume, e = electronic charge and\nd\nv = average drift velocity of charge carriers in an applied electric field. We\nthus obtain:\n\nd\nσ = (N e v ) /E\n\nand if we define\nd\n(v /E) = μ, the charge carrier mobility, we have:\n\nσ = N e μ\n\nIn intrinsic semiconductors we have both electrons and holes contributing to\nconduction:\n\ne\ne\nn\nh\ne\nh\nσ = N eμ + N eμ = Ne(μ + μ )\n\nsince Ne = Nh. Taking the number of thermally generated charge carriers,\ngiven by the relationship\n\n-E /2KT\n3/2\ng\nN = AT\ne\n\nwe obtain the temperature dependence of the conductivity as:\n\n=\n×\n-E /2KT\n3/2\ng\ne\nh\nσ\nAT\ne\ne(μ + μ )\n\nTo assess the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity we must take\ninto consideration that, because of increased vibration of the atoms about\ntheir lattice positions, the charge carrier mobility will decrease (increased\nscattering of charge carriers) with increasing temperature. This effect explains\nwhy the electronic conductivity in metals, where N is constant, will decrease\nwith increasing temperature. In semiconductors, where N increases with\ntemperature, the accompanying mobility effect is not apparent at low\ntemperatures (conductivity increases), but becomes pronounced at high\ntemperatures (conductivity decreases).\n\nb. Introduction of shallow impurity (or defect) states close to the conduction or\nvalence band. This is accomplished by the incorporation of appropriate dopant\nelements into the crystal matrix. If these impurities are shallow (~0.01 eV\nfrom the conduction or valence band), they will be totally ionized at room\ntemperature and each will contribute an electron (donor dopant: K, Na) or\nholes (acceptor dopant: G, Br), thus increasing the electrical conductivity\nwithout the necessity of a temperature rise. (Be aware that certain defects in\nthe crystal lattice may also increase the electronic conductivity.)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\n\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n3.091SC Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Support your answer with an appropriate\nsketch.\n\nSolution\n\nThe tensile strength is largely controlled by slip, which in FCC systems such as\naluminum involves the twelve {111} <110> slip systems. The mobility of\ndislocations, which controls slip, is high in single crystals because of the high degree\n\nof crystal perfection, so slip proceeds from one external surface to another. In\npolycrystalline Al, the mobility of dislocations is slower because of mutual\ninterference (high density of dislocations) and because precipitates are frequently\nencountered, so slip is retarded. Slip, moreover, is arrested at grain boundaries and\ndeflected in different directions; thus, the strength of polycrystalline material is\nhigher than that of single crystals.\n\nslip systems in single crystals\nslip systems in polycrystalline materials\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\n\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n3.091SC Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
