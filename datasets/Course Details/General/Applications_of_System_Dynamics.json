  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Description\n\n15.875 explores how organizations can use system dynamics to achieve important goals. Student teams work with managers to tackle the clients' most pressing issues. Students discuss experiences with their clients, and learn the modeling and consulting skills they need to be effective. Projects are sponsored by diverse organizations from a range of industries and sizes from start-ups to the Fortune 500. This course focuses on gaining practical insight from the system dynamics process, and appeals to people interested in system dynamics, consulting, or managerial policy-making.\n\nCourse Format\n\nThis project-based course meets for two 90-minute sessions each week. Prof. James Hines lectures in the first meeting of each week, while keeping the class highly interactive. In the other session, the class splits into two or three groups for \"break out sessions\" led by Prof. Hines or a teaching assistant. In each of these sessions, students give presentations to the group about the project work they've done the previous week.\n\nAt the first class, students form groups of two to four members and are given a list of potential project topics. Each project is sponsored by a company or organization, who will act as the students' client throughout the semester. Once the topic is chosen, the teams follow the \"standard method\" in completing their projects, which is described step-by-step on the\nprojects\npage.\n\nTextbook\n\nChapters are assigned weekly from the course textbook:\n\nSchein, Edgar H.\nProcess Consultation Revisited: Building the Helping Relationship\n. Prentice Hall, 1998. ISBN: 020134596X.\n\n(The textbook is secondary to the handouts listed under lecture notes.)\n\nGrading\n\nA student's grade for the course is based on his or her performance on the team project.",

that's like keeping a high priced\nracehorse to get fertilizer.\n...if you feel all the things that humans have done in the past on the moon\nand in low earth orbit are not worth continuing, why do you believe that\nhumans on Mars will accomplish things that are worth the cost?\"\n(http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=952)\n\nCongressional Frustrations\n- Our client: Bill Adkins, Staff Director for\nU.S. Congress House of Rep.\nSubcommittee on Space\n- NASA programs involving manned\nspaceflight have historically fallen short in\nmeeting promises\n- Fear for new space initiative involving the\nCrew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) aka\nProject \"Constellation\"\n- General concern in Congress regarding\nNASA's management capabilities for all\nprograms, not just CEV.\n15.875 Project\nPrologue\nBackground\nProblem\nInsights\nRec's\n\nSpace Shuttle Program\nCost & Schedule Overruns in NASA\nPrograms Are the Norm, Not the Exception\nPLAN\nExpected to fly 50x per year @ $50 million per flight.\nACTUAL\nPeaked at 9 flights in 1985, costs $500 million per flight\n15.875 Project\nPrologue\nBackground\nProblem\nInsights\nRec's\n\nRLV (X-33)\nCost & Schedule Overruns in NASA\nPrograms Are the Norm, Not the Exception\nPLAN\nGoal: reduce launch cost by order of magnitude\nSpent $1 billion on development.\nACTUAL\nCancelled before first prototype was completed\n15.875 Project\nPrologue\nBackground\nProblem\nInsights\nRec's\n\nInternational Space Station\nCost & Schedule Overruns in NASA\nPrograms Are the Norm, Not the Exception\nPLAN\nOriginal 1984 plan: fully operational by 1992 at cost of $8 billion.\nACTUAL\nToday: hope to reach full operations by 2008, est cost of $100 billion\n15.875 Project\nPrologue\nBackground\nProblem\nInsights\nRec's\n\nWhat's Causing These Overruns?\n15.875 Project\nPrologue\nBackground\nProblem\nInsights\nRec's\nPoor financial management systems\nCost-plus contract structures\nElection cycles & changing priorities\nCultural aversion to failure\nComplexity of international cooperation\nFocus on development vs operations\nInadequate attention to iterative testing\nChanges in the marketplace\nIncumbent power of legacy programs\nLack of consensus on program goals\nCulture of field-center \"fiefdoms\"\nPolitical drivers supersede rational management\nUnion rules & Federal regulations limit workforce flexibility\nInadequate lessons learned process\nCommercial market draws away best talent\nManagerial myopia creates long-term problems\nPoor cost analysis & estimation capabilities\nAging workforce - declining experience base\nMisaligned incentive systems\n\nExternalities\nExecution\nPlanning\nPLANNING\n- Cost analysis capabilities\n- Past lessons learned\n- Acquisition strategy\n- Duopoly factors\n- Incumbent's curse\n- Legacy program power\n- Budget expectations\n- Managing optimism\nEXECUTION\n- Requirements controls\n- Phase-level optimization\n- Managerial incentives\n- Stovepipe organizations\n- Measurement systems\n- Human resources\n- Cultural Issues\nEXTERNALITIES\n- Election cycle instability\n- Political drivers\n- Multi-party process\n- Market volatility\nKey Insight: Layers of Influence & Control\nEverything has to align for projects & programs to succeed.\n15.875 Project\nPrologue\nBackground\nProblem\nInsights\nRec's\n\nInadequate project cost and\nschedule estimation capabilities\n-\nLack of accurate cost estimates - question of both\nability to make good estimates and incentives to\nmake them accurate\n-\nInadequate project cost and schedule estimation\ncapabilities -- lack the skills and/or resource base\nnecessary to generate accurate estimates\n-\nInadequate support infrastructure - esp. financial\nmanagement and lessons learned / knowledge\nmanagement systems - hinder effective project\nmanagement, esp. over long-term multi-year efforts\n-\nGenuine but misinformed optimism leads to\nunderestimation of technical challenges and\noverestimation of RDT&E capabilities\nPlanning\n15.875 Project\nPrologue\nBackground\nProblem\nInsights\nRec's\n\n\"Willful Ignorance\" towards\ntarget achievability\n-\nCost-plus contract structure allows firms to\nunderbid up front and make up for it through later\ncontract additions and modifications\n-\nCulture encourages \"liar's club\" behavior;\neveryone wants to hit aggressive targets, no one\nwants to say it can't be done\n-\nLegacy programs absorb resources in essentially\nflat budget environment;

Is\nthere any other space program which promises dramatic results in which we could\nwin?\nKennedy's Speech at Rice University, September 12, 1962\nFinally, in a field where the United States and the Soviet Union have a special\ncapacity--in the field of space -- there is room for new cooperation, for further joint\nefforts in the regulation and exploration of space... Surely we should explore\nwhether the scientists and astronauts of our two countries -- indeed of all the\nworld -- cannot work together in the conquest of space, sending someday in this\ndecade to the moon not the representatives of a single nation, but the\nrepresentatives of all of our countries.\nThe contest will continue--the contest between those who see a monolithic world\nand those who believe in diversity--but it should be a contest in leadership and\nresponsibility instead of destruction, a contest in achievement instead of\nintimidation."

      "content": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nSloan School of Management\nSystem Dynamics II: Applications of System Dynamics\n\nProfessor Jim Hines\n\nThe \"Standard Method\"1\n\nWhat is the \"standard method\"? The standard method is the sequence of activities (or\nthe process) most teams will follow in doing their projects. Each week you will receive a\nhandout describing the particular step of the standard method that you should be working\non with your client.\n\nWe encourage you to stay as close to the standard method as you can. Of course, your\nproject is your project, so you (in consultation with your client) should feel free to depart\nfrom the standard method as desired. However, we ask that when you try something new\nor different, you think of it as an experiment that you can tell us all about. Jot down what\nyou're doing differently and why. What do you hope to accomplish? How did it turn out\nand why?\n\nWhy do we call it the \"standard method\"? Most top system dynamics practitioners\nfollow processes that are similar to what we do in class. On the other hand, all\npractitioners have their own modifications. We were in a quandary. If we called this the\n\"Jim Hines Method\", everyone would say, \"That's not the Jim Hines Method, that's the\nprocess that everyone follows. I've been doing it for years. It's standard!\" Of course by\ncalling it the \"standard method\", everyone will now say, \"That's not the standard method,\nit's just Hines' method. What I do is the standard method, and it's totally different\". We\nfinally decided to go forward with the \"standard method\", because it seemed less self-\naggrandizing than the \"Jim Hines method\".\n\nSteps in the standard method. The steps of the standard method will probably seem\nfamiliar to you after taking after having taken System Dynamics for Business Policy or\nSystem Dynamics: Managing Complexity (or, perhaps, a course equivalent to either of\nthese). The steps are:\n\n1) Problem definition\na) List of variables\nb) Reference modes\nc) Problem statement\n2) Momentum policies\n3) Dynamic hypotheses (i.e. causal loops)\n4) Model first loop\n5) Analyze first loop\n6) Model second loop\n\n1 Prepared by Jim Hines, February 1999. Revised February 2001. Revised February 2004.\nCopyright (c) 1999-2004 Jim Hines\n\n7) Analyze second loop\n8) Etc.\n\nConclusions and insights should emerge at every step and may emerge at any minute\nduring the standard method. Be sure to record these conclusions and insights when they\noccur.\n\nQuick example of the standard method. In this example, we'll end up building a\nclassic diffusion model. But, let's pretend that we don't know what a diffusion model is.\n(If you don't know what a diffusion model is, this little exercise will show you).\n\nOur first meeting with the client begins in a conference room with the vice president of\nthe automated products division, and his direct reports (marketing, manufacturing,\nresearch and development). The VP provides some introductions and context.\n\n\"Our Automated Fly Swatter is a great product. But, we need to\nunderstand the key drivers in the fly market, so I've hired these\nvery smart folks from MIT. Let me just turn it over to them so\nthey can tell us what those key drivers are.\"\n\nAt this point everyone turns to you and expects you to say something brilliant. That's too\nhard, so instead you stand up and say \"We don't really don't know anything about fly\nswatters or even much about flies and very little about your culture, your values, the way\nyou do business. One thing I do know, though, is if I were this were my problem, I\nwouldn't turn it over to anyone less than the most knowledgeable people on the planet -\nand that's you guys. The reason I think you probably really need us is not because you\nknow too little about the technology, your own company and the market, but because you\nknow too much. You know thousands of things and thousands of ways that they're all\ninterconnected.\"\n\nAt this point you stop to look meaningfully into the eyes of a few of the managers around\nthe table. \"What you probably need,\" you continue, \"is some help in talking about what\nyou know and structuring all that knowledge in a way powerful enough so that you can\nsee what the key things are you really ought to do.\" You pause again just to make sure\nthat the reason managers are nodding is that they agree with you and not because they're\nall about to drift off to sleep.\n\nOnce you're reassured you continue, \"If that's what you need, then we're in good shape\nbecause what we have to offer is exactly that: A structured process for talking and\nthinking and for arranging what you know in a way that makes it easier to figure out what\nto do. Fortunately, you don't have to take my word for it. The process contains a\nnumber of steps and the first step is easier to do than to talk about. So, what do you say?\nShould we start?\"\nWhat can they say, except, \"Well...sure, let's just dig in\". So, you tell them that you\nwant to begin by simply listing important variables\". Slowly at first and then with\n\nincreasing speed the managers call out variables while you write them on a flip chart.\nYou record:\n\nVariables List:\n- Fly population\n- Revenues\n- Unit Sales\n- Annoyance at flies\n- Market saturation\n- Manufacturing costs\n- Price\n- Cost of batteries\n- Word of mouth about our product\n- Product recalls\n- Health problems with our products\n- ...etc.\n\nEventually, your managers run out of steam. You call a break, and ask that during the\nbreak people mark what they think are the five most important variables.\n\nReference Modes: Returning from the break, you explain that you want to graph the\nbehavior of some of the variables. Identifying the half dozen variables that received the\nmost \"votes\", you lead the group through a reference mode exercise drawing each one on\na flip chart. For example, one of the reference modes might be\n\nHope\nUnit\nFear\nSales\nNow\nYear\n\n(Looking at the graph some one in the group says, \"You know, for a long time we won't\nbe able to tell which trajectory we're on\". You immediately find a fresh flip chart, title it\n\"Insights\" and right that baby down.)\n\nProblem statement: One or more of your reference modes almost certainly will contain\nthe true concern of the clients. You phrase it to the group, but you don't write it down,\nafter all a picture is worth a thousand words. You just point to the curve and say:\n\nWe hope that the initial growth trend of AFS sales continues and\nthat the product ultimately becomes a stable, high-volume seller.\nBut we're worried that sales, after appearing to be on track, might\ntake a nosedive leaving us with mediocre or low sales, and way\ntoo much capacity. If we are successful in our project here we\nwill increase the likelihood of the curve labeled \"hope\" and\ndecrease the likelihood of the curve labeled \"fear\".\n\nMomentum policies. Momentum policies (i.e. solutions) are what the client would\nimplement now to solve the problem, if they had no further time to collect information or\nponder. Once you have a problem focus, you are in a position to collect momentum\npolicies.\n\nContinuing with our example, you point out to your client that the system dynamics\nprocess has already added something by crystallizing the problem. You explain, though,\nthat you would like to be able to gauge at the end of the process, whether anything\nbeyond this additional specificity has come out of the project. Consequently you'd like\nto record what the client would do now about the problem, if decisions had to be made\nimmediately.\n\nYou record ideas like:\n\"We need to do a market study\"\n\"We should start a competitor intelligence unit\"\n\"We need to get data on the drivers of the market\"\n\"We've got to get better forecasts from the Economics Group\".\n\nNote that these policies are not all well thought out, and some are not even policies. No\nproblem, simply record them. Store them away. You might want to use them to suggest\ntests or directions of inquiry, but at least (and in most cases at most) you will pull them\nout ten weeks from now to say, \"look how far we've come\".\n\nCausal loop diagram. With variables, reference modes, and a problem-focus, you will\nbe in position to start coming up with dynamic hypotheses; that is, loops that describe\nfeedback processes capable of generating the patterns in your reference modes. Coming\nup with a diagram will take several weeks, and will likely result in a number of insights\nand good ideas.\n\nCustomers\nWord of mouth\nsales\n+\n+\n+\nRemaning\ncustomers-\n+\nCompetition\nProduct category\nattractiveness\n+\n+\nMarket\nshare\n+\n+\nLearning\nhow to mfg\nCost\n+\n-\n-\n\nAgain remember to record insights as they come up. For example: \"The learning loop\ncounteracts the running-out-of customers loop\" and \"We can strengthen the word-of-\nmouth loop with a sign-up-a-friend promotion\".\n\nModeling. Finally, at about the mid point in the semester, you will be ready to model.\nBy this time, your clients realize that the model is not the actual objective, rather the\nprocess is. The modeling is simply the next step in the process, it may help people refine\nsome of the insights you've already recorded, it will probably result in additional\ninsights, but it probably won't contradict any of the insights you've already had.\n\nHere's what you'll do: You will choose a loop, model it, simulate, analyze, and work\nwith your client to develop insights and ideas. Then you'll choose another loop, add it to\nyour growing model, simulate, analyze again, and work on further developing new or\nexisting ideas.\n\nYou will probably only have time to model two or three loops. As always you'll record\ninsights and conclusions as you go along. For example, \"Strengthening the positive\nword-of-mouth loop creates a faster rise and a deeper collapse.\" and \"Replacement sales\nmay lesson the severity of the down-turn in sales\".\n\nCustomers\nRemaining\nCustomers\nSales\nContacts\nSociability\nContacts with\nnon-customers\nNon-customer\nprevalence\nMarket size\nWord of\nmouth sales\nFruitfullness\n\n********************************\n.diffusion\n********************************\nSales = Word of mouth sales\n\nUnits: people/year\nWord of mouth sales =\n\"Contacts with non-customers\" * Fruitfulness\n\nUnits: people/year\nFruitfulness = 0.05\n\nUnits: fraction\n\"Contacts with non-customers\" =\nContacts * \"Non-customer prevalence\"\n\nUnits: people/year\nContacts = Customers * Sociability\n\nUnits: people/year\n\nCurrent\nSales\n50,000\n37,499\n25,000\n12,501\nWord of mouth sales\n50,000\n37,499\n25,000\n12,501\nTime (year)\n\nSociability = 40\n\nUnits: people/(year*person)\nCustomers = INTEG( Sales , 1)\n\nUnits: people\n\"Non-customer prevalence\" =\nRemaining Customers / Market size\n\nUnits: fraction\nRemaining Customers = INTEG( - Sales , 100000)\n\nUnits: people\nMarket size = Customers + Remaining Customers\n\nUnits: people\n********************************\n.Control\n********************************\nFINAL TIME = 10\n\nUnits: year\nINITIAL TIME = 0\n\nUnits: year\nSAVEPER = TIME STEP\n\nUnits: year\nTIME STEP = 0.0625\n\nUnits: year\n\nYou may find that the modeling leads to the best insights. Or you may find in retrospect\nthat the causal loops, or even the reference modes, was the source of the most important\ninsights and conclusions. You may find that some people involved in the process liked\nthe modeling best and others liked causal looping or something else best. The important\nlesson from this is that the model is not the goal of the engagement. The goal is to use\nthe entire process to help the client. Modeling is just one piece - in any particular\nsituation it might provide the brightest illumination, but in another situation a different\npart of the process might turn out to be the real source of light, and in yet another\nsituation, the entire process may shine with a uniform brilliance.\n\nFinal presentation. The final presentation is not really part of the standard method. But\nfor completeness, here's a brief description. Your final presentation will summarize your\nproject, stressing what you and/or the client learned in the process and how the project\nhas made a practical difference somewhere. There are many different kinds of things that\ncan be learned from the process and many ways to have made a difference. You will\nhave been preparing for the final presentation throughout the term by keeping track of\nwhat you and the client are learning and how that has changed or will change what your\nand/or the client (may) do.\n\nThe final presentations are always wonderful - full of insight, humor, and importance.\nWe'd like you to invite your client to the final presentations (now is not too early). Your\nclient may wonder if she really wants to display the project in public. Reassure your\nclient that you won't present anything that the client considers sensitive. These projects\nare rich and so there is never any shortage of things to present."
