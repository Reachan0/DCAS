      "content": "Name: _______________________________\n\nMASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\n6.091 Hands-On Introduction to EE Lab Skills\nLaboratory No. 1 Oscilloscopes, Multimeter, Function Generator\nIAP 2008\n\n1 Objective\n\nIn this laboratory, you will become familiar with using a function generator, a digital\nmultimeter and an oscilloscope. You will construct simple electronic circuits and develop\na quantitative and qualitative understanding of the behavior of these circuits.\n\n1.1 Digital Multimeters DMM\nDMM can measure voltage, current, and resistance. Remember that voltage\nmeasurements are taken in parallel while current measurements are taken in series.\n\n1.1.1 Exercise - Resistance Measurement\n\nGet the following resistors from the drawers: 10K, 15K, 1M, 1.5M. Measure the\nresistance by attaching the resistors to the DMM with alligator clips. Set the DMM\nto resistance mode (Ω). Now hold the alligator clips with each hand and measure\nthe body resistance. Now dip your fingers into a cup of water and repeat the\nmeasurement.\n\n1.1.2 Exercise - Voltage and Current Measurements\n\nWire up the following circuit on your protoboard. Use +5VDC from the\nProto-Board. All voltage measurements are referenced with respect to ground\n(zero) unless otherwise noted. Use your personal DMM for this exercise.\n\n+5\nR1\nR2\nVo\n\nSet the DMM to voltage mode. Measure Vo for\nR1=10K R2=15K. Now measure the current\nflowing through R1 and R2.\n\nHow does voltage measurement differ from\ncurrent measurement?\n\nRepeat for R1=1M, R2=1.5M. Explain why the\nmeasurements are different. Estimate the\ninput resistance (order of magnitude) of the\nDMM? Repeat using the Agilent DMM.\nExplain the difference.\n\n1.2 Oscilloscopes\nThe best way to become familiar with an oscilloscope (scope) is to use it. Each\noscilloscope has a calibration signal available on the front panel. (1) Turn on the\noscilloscope and attach a scope probe to the calibration signal. (2) Adjust the various\ncontrols until you see a signal. If after 5 minutes, you cannot get the scope to work\nask your TA or Instructor.\n\n1.2.1 Exercise - Cursor and the calibration signal\nThe scope has both vertical and horizontal bars (sliders) that allow for voltage\nand time measurements. To select and move the sliders, use the controls near\nthe top of front panel marked \"Cursor\", \"Select\" and \"Display\". Together with the\nbuttons at the bottom and to the right of the display, you will be able to make\nvoltage and time measurements. When making voltage measurements be sure\nyou know where the zero reference is.\n\na) Before starting any measurement, calibrate the scope probe. There is an\nadjustment screw on the probe body. Turn the screw adjustment until the\ncalibration signal is a perfect square wave. Now, using the measurement\nfeatures of the oscilloscope, measure the voltage and frequency of the\ncalibration signal. What is frequency and peak to peak value of the\ncalibration signal? Trigger the display on the positive and negative edge.\n\nFrequency =\n\nPeak to Peak Voltage =\n\nRMS Voltage (DC Coupling) =\n\nRMS Voltage (AC Coupling) =\n\nExplain why the difference in RMS between DC Coupling and AC\nCoupling.\n\nb) Use the scope in single run mode. Why is single run mode useful?\n\nc) Set the input coupling to AC. Without going into the mathematical details,\nqualitatively describe when AC coupling is used and when DC coupling is\nused. If in doubt, notice the difference in display between AC coupling\nand DC coupling with the calibration signal.\n\n1.2.2 Exercise - Scope Probes\n\na) Touch your finger tip to the scope probe. What is the frequency of the\nsignal and where is it coming from?\n\nJanuary, 2008\n6.091 Lab 1\np 2 of 7\n\nb) Attached a 12\" length of wire between the ground of the scope and the\ninput. What value of the voltage do you see? Where is the signal coming\nfrom?\n\n1.3 Function Generator\nThe function generator generates sine waves, square waves, ramps. The waveform\nparameters such as duty cycle, frequency, and amplitude are set via the front panel\nbuttons. A perfectly symmetrical square wave has a 50% duty cycle. A waveform\nwhich is on for 1 ms and off for 9ms has a 10% duty cycle. Though this waveform is\nnot \"square\" it is still commonly referred to as a square wave.\n\n1.3.1 Exercise - Waveforms\n\na) Turn on the function generator and attach the output to the scope. Press the\noutput button on the function generator and set the output to \"high Z\". The\nfunction generator will then be able to output a 10v signal. Display the following\nwaveforms:\n\n- 10 khz sinewave, 10 volt peak to peak\n\n- 10 khz square wave, 10 volt peak to peak (0 v to +10 v)\n\nb) Build the following circuit with R = 1K and C = 0.1μf and use the function\ngenerator as the input source using the 10 khz square wave. Set. Display the\ninput voltage source on channel 1 and display Vo on channel 2. Trigger the\ndisplay on channel 1. You should be able to observe a relationship between the\ntwo waveforms. Remember that a capacitor is a component that holds a charge.\nAs the charge increases, the voltage increases. Describe qualitatively what is\nhappening to the voltage across the capacitor.\n\nR\nc\n+\nVo\n-\n\nc) Repeat the experiment with C = 0.001μf. What is the effect of reducing the\ncapacitance?\n\nJanuary, 2008\n6.091 Lab 1\np 3 of 7\n\n1.3.2 Exercise - Using Diodes\n\na) Diodes allow current to flow in one direction. The direction is indicated by the\ndirection of the arrow. Using the function generator as the source, wire up the\nfollowing circuit using a 1N4001 and a R=10K. The strip or bar marking on the\ndiode corresponds to the bar/strip (cathode) in the symbol.\n\nR\n+\nVo\n-\n\nUsing a sine wave, 10v peak to peak, 500 hz, display both the input source and\nthe voltage across the resistor. What is happening? Sketch the input and output\nvoltage below:\n\nThe diode is a directional device and must be\ninstalled in the correct orientation!\nJanuary, 2008\n6.091 Lab 1\np 4 of 7\n\nb) Now attach 0.1μf capacitor in parallel with the resistor. What happens now?\nNote again that the diode allows current to flow in one direction only.\n\nR\n+\nVo\n-\n\nJanuary, 2008\n6.091 Lab 1\np 5 of 7\n\n1.3.3 R2R Ladder\n\nThe R2R ladder is one of the key circuits used for digital to analog conversion.\nBuild the following circuit using R = 1k, 2R = 2k. Be sure to use the 1% precision\nresistors (blue body). The resistors and switches are on bench as you enter the\nlab. Use the pushbutton switches.\n\nR\nR\n+5\nR\n+5\nR\n+5\nR\n+5\n2R\n2R\n2R\n2R\nVo\nBo\nB3\nB2\nB1\n\nIn a later lecture, the formula for the output will be derived.\n\nVo =\n⎥⎦\n⎤\n⎢⎣\n⎡\n+\n+\n+\nB\nB\nB\nB\n\nBB3\nBB2\nBB1\nBB0\nV0\n\nSwitch value of 1 = +5 V\n\nJanuary, 2008\n6.091 Lab 1\np 6 of 7\n\n1.3.4 Resistor Cube\n\nUsing (12) 1k resistors, create and solder a cube.

Resistors, if\nneeded are available from the drawers in the center of the lab in 38-600. The pin\nout for the 2N2222 BJT is shown below.

This mode of operation is called open-loop,\ni.e. no feedback. In this mode, the output voltage will be very high (the plus rail) or\nvery low (the negative rail). Applications with negative feedback are generally used\nfor amplification, signal processing and conditioning.\n\n1.2.1 Exercise - Comparators\nWire up a comparator on the proto-board using 741 op-amp. The 741 pin out is\nshown below. The offset null pins are used to fine tune the 741 so that a zero\ninput will result in an actual zero output.\n\nOffset Null\nNC\n+\nInverting Input\nV\nNon-Inverting Input\nOutput\n-\nV\nOffset Null\n\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nBe sure to supply power and ground.

Be sure to supply\npower and ground.\n\nUse R1=10k, R2=4.7k, R3=10k, C=.33μf\n\nDisplay V- and Vo on the scope. Describe what is happening. Now replace R3\nwith a 4.7k resistor. Predict what the change is in the frequency. (The phrase\nastable oscillator is redundant. Oscillators by definition are not stable.)\n\n1.2.3 Exercise - Inverting Amplifier\nWire up a comparator on the proto-board using 741 op-amp. Be sure to supply\npower and ground. Turn on function generator using a 5 volt ramp. Display both\nthe input and the output on an oscilloscope. How is the output related to the\ninput?\n\nWhat is the peak output voltage? This is also referred to as saturation.\n\nWhat is the minimum output voltage?\n\nIncrease the input frequency until the gain begins to decrease.

This\nmakes the lab exercises more fun and less stressful. However, in the real world,\nop-amps are not ideal. For example, if V+ = V- the output should be zero. In\nactuality, it is not.\n\nThe real world op-amp has a very small offset voltage between V+ and V-. This\nis typically 2-5 mv. To cancel out or null out this offset voltage, the op-amp\nprovides two pins (pins 1 and 5) to \"null\" out the offset voltage. Set Vin=0.\nMeasure the output with a DMM. Most likely it is not zero. Now add the null\nadjustment (dotted section) to your circuit and adjust the pot until the output is\nzero with both inputs grounded.\n\nVo\nV-\nV+\nVin\n10k\n1k\n-15V\n10k\n\n1.2.4 Exercise - Integrator\nOp-amps are frequently used as integrators. For example, when an input is\ntriggered, i.e. turned on, the integral of the input signal is directly proportional to\nthe on time. Wire up an integrator on the proto-board, this time using a 356 op-\namp. Use R1=4.7k, C=0.1μf, R2 = 1m. R2 provides a path for the input bias\ncurrent and can be almost ignored in the circuit.\n\nVo\nV-\nV+\nVin\nR2\nR1\nC\n\nJanuary, 2008\n6.091 Lab 2\np 4 of 5\n\nInput a square wave to the integrator. As you decrease the frequency, the output\nno longer looks like an integral of the input signal. Explain qualitatively why that\noccurs.\n\nDisplay both the input and the output on an oscilloscope. Notice that for a\nsquare wave, the output voltage is proportional to the \"on\" time.\n\n1.2.5 Exercise Schmitt Trigger (Optional)\nA Schmitt trigger has different thresholds for rising edge and falling edge signals.\nAmong other uses, it can be used to trigger on slowly changing signals.

By now, you should be familiar with most of the instruments and construction\ntechniques.\n\n1.1 Zener Diode\nZener diodes are used to produce a fixed reference voltage. Many integrated circuits\nhave zener diodes imbedded in the circuits. Within limits, the zener will maintain a\nfixed voltage. Of course, if you exceed the maximum allowable current, the diode will\nself-destruct.\n\n1.1.1 Exercise - Zener Diode Characteristic\n\nBuild the circuit below using parts from the parts bin in the lab.

Common voltages are\n+5, +12, +15, -12, and -15. 3.3V and lower voltages are now common place. In this\nexercise you will build a variable voltage power supply. Build the following circuit.\nThe op-amp will attempt to keep V- = V+. V+ is just the voltage from the\npotentiometer. V- is the output voltage. What is the highest voltage possible for V+?\n\nWhat is the range of output voltage you able to achieve with a resistor load (not\nshown) of 10k at the output? Repeat for a 1K load. Now very carefully repeat with a\n100 ohm load. Be very careful! The 2N2222 will most likely overheat and self\ndestruct. The 100 ohm resistor may overheat too. Why?\n\nThis is not a particularly good power supply design. The objective is to show the use\nof the zener diode as a reference, a voltage divider resistor, the use of negative\nfeedback to achieve voltage regulation and the heat dissipation of a linear voltage\nregulator. In most applications, the above circuit can be replaced with a LM317\nintegrated circuit.\n\nReprinted with permission of National Semiconductor Corporation.\nVo\nV+\nV-\n.\n+15\n0.1uf\n5K\npot\n2N2222\n0.1uf\n1N758\nJanuary, 2008\n6.091 Lab 3\np 2 of 4\n\n1.3 Timers - 555\n\nIntroduction to Philips Application Note AN170, 555 Applications, removed due\nto copyright restrictions.\n\n1.3.1 Exercise - 555 Oscillator\nOne of the most common applications for the 555 is an oscillator.

As such, the frequency is relatively immune to voltage changes.\n\n1.3.2 Exercise - Closet Light Timer\nMany closets have lights controlled by the closet door. Unfortunately if the door is\nleft open, the light remains on - wasting energy. This circuit turns on the light\nwhen the door opened but will turn off the light after a predetermined period.

You may implement the lock with a\n4 bit or 8 bit code. One pushbutton switch is a \"1\" button. The other pushbutton is a \"0\"\nbutton. When the correct sequence of code is pressed, an LED will light indicating that the\nlock is \"unlocked\". This LED signal can be used to disable a siren, etc.\n\n1.1 Block Diagram\n\nThe first step in a design is to lay out a block diagram of the design. This allows the\nengineer to get a high level view of the design. In the section below, sketch the block\ndiagram of the digital lock. Show the inputs, control circuit and output. The inputs are two\npushbuttons, a gate is used to form a composite clock, the shift register and the decoder\nform the control unit.\n\n1.2 Debounce Circuit\n\nAs a first step in the digital lock, two debounce circuits are used create a clock for the\nshift register. Wire up both debounce circuits and verify the operation. The pinouts for\nthe NAND (74LS00) gates and AND (74LS08) are attached at the end. The NAND and\nAND gates are available from the drawers.\n\n+5v\n1K\n+5v\n1K\nQ \"1\"\nSPDT\nswitch\nT\nB\n+5v\n1K\n+5v\n1K\nQ \"0\"\nSPDT\nswitch\nT\nB\ncomposite\nclock\n\nVerify with an oscilloscope that the debounce circuits function properly and a composite\nclock is generated.\n\nJanuary, 2008\n6.091 Lab 5\np 2 of 3\n\n1.3 Shift Register\n\nWire up shift register using a 74LS175. Add 4 leds (with 470 ohm resistor) to the Qbar\noutput to aid in the debugging. As data is clocked in, you should see the data shift\nbetween the flip flops. The leds are NOT shown in this schematic. You can also ask to\nuse a pre-built led display for debugging from a LA or the instructor.\n\nHow should the pushbuttons and debounce circuit be wired to the shift register? How do\nyou tell which button was pressed (hint: what is pin 7 of the 74LS175 used for)?\n\nWhat should pin 1 of the 74LS175 be tied to?\n\n(A larger schematic is attached at the end for your use.)\n\nIf you circuit is wired correctly, you should be able to clock in a series of \"1\" and \"0\". Now\nselect your code and wired appropriate outputs of the shift register to turn on the led with\nthe 4 input NAND gate\n\n+5v\n1K\n74LS20\n+5V\nUse 4 input NAND\ngate to decode\n+5v\n1K\nQ \"1\"\nT\nSPDT\nswitch\nB\n+5v\n1K\n+5v\n1K\nQ \"0\"\ncomposite\nclock\nT\nSPDT\nswitch\nB\nJanuary, 2008\n6.091 Lab 5\np 3 of 3 Logic diagram for a four bit shift register.\n\nDigital Lock\n6.091 Jan 2008"
