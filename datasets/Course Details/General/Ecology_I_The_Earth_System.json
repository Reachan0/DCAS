San Francisco, CA: Benjamin Cummings, 2001. ISBN: 9780321068811.\n\nAncillary readings will be made available through the course Web site. These will be assigned to be associated with particular Lectures.\n\nRecitations\n\nRecitations will be run by the TAs, undergraduate teaching fellows (UTFs), and Harlan Breindel and Leslie Roldan from the Writing Program unless otherwise specified. We strongly encourage you to attend. Content presented in some of the recitations will be essential for your term project.\n\nClass Handouts\n\nOutlines and specific reading assignments will be made available for each cluster of lectures on a specific topic. Study guides will be available before each quiz to help you focus your reading and studying.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nNOTES\n\nQuizzes\n\n50%\n\nThere will be 3 quizzes throughout the semester. The third quiz will be cumulative.\n\nTerm project\n\n40%\n\nNote that Communications Intensive grades contribute to this.\n\nHomework\n\n10%\n\nThe problem sets will rely on readings as well as lecture notes. You can work in groups of 3 if you so choose, and submit them as a group.\n\nExtra credit\n\nThere may be extra credit questions on the exams as well as extra credit activities. These count above and beyond the normal curve of the class (in other words, you can get an A without extra credit). Extra credit factors into a grade only when a student is on the borderline between two grades. It can tip the balance.\n\nExpectations\n\nShow up, be honest, and do your best.\n\nWe hope that as a result of this course you will:\n\nLook at the Earth in a different way, and appreciate the complex interactions between living organisms and the non-living components of our planet. It is these interactions that shape your future.\n\nBecome a more critical thinker, and bring the concepts you learned in this course into the way you approach your life and careers.\n\nImprove your writing and speaking skills.\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nAlthough MIT does not have an honor code, in 1.018 we function as though it does. We will not police you. We assume that you are honest, are here to learn, and are proud of your work.\n\nPolicy on cheating\n\nIf a student is caught turning in a paper or homework that was written by someone else, or copying text from sources without referencing them, or cheating on an exam, he or she will be given an F on the assignment, and likely be reported to the Committee on Discipline. If you have questions regarding what constitutes the appropriate use of sources and plagiarism, you should consult with a member of the course staff.\nAcademic Integrity at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nis a useful handbook for understanding what constitutes violations of academic integrity, for citing sources, and for avoiding plagiarism.

You have decided to follow in your TA's footsteps and pursue a career in oceanography. Because you\nwere so inspired by 1.018, you are especially interested in the productivity of oceans due to their\nimportance on a global scale. You break the news to a fellow classmate who says, \"But don't oceans have\nthe same productivity as deserts?

Your discussion about oceans and aquatic ecosystems gets you thinking about how they compare with\nterrestrial systems.

Explain how it is possible that the same substance could be either an electron donor or an electron\nacceptor for different microorganisms. Under what conditions might this happen? Give one example.\nSome compounds that are in an intermediate redox state can serve as either electron donors or electron\nacceptors depending on different environmental conditions and microorganisms involved. This can happen\nbecause the thermodynamics is dependent on the redox couple of electron donor and acceptor species. One\nexample of a compound that can serve as either an electron donor or acceptor is nitrite, NO2\n-. Some\nnitrifying bacteria can oxidize nitrite to nitrate to gain energy (coupling the nitrite oxidation to the\nreduction of oxygen, an aerobic respiration).\nNO2 + H2O - NO3 + 2 H+ + 2 e\nOn the other hand, in the absence of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, some denitrifying bacteria can\nreduce nitrite to ammonia (using nitrite as the terminal electron acceptor, and glucose or other compounds\nas electron donors).\n-\nNO2 + 8 H+ + 6 e- - NH4\n+ + 2 H2O\nOther possibilities of compounds that could serve as either electron donors or acceptors from the Standard\nReduction Potential table include Fe2+ and S:\nFe2+ - Fe3+ + e\nFe2+ + 2 e- - Fe\nS + 4 H2O - SO4\n2- + 8 H+ + 6 e-\nS + 2 H+ + 2 e- - H2S\nc.

This does look like a potential reaction in a respiratory\npathway because it produces energy. This reaction takes place in the electron transport chain of E. coli.\n2. (11 points)\na. In the article by Des Marais, an estimate is given for global photosynthetic productivity. Using this\nnumber and the formula for photosynthesis in the Remmert paper, estimate, in kg, the annual amount of\nwater and CO2 consumed by photosynthesis, as well as the amount of O2 produced.\nGlobal photosynthetic productivity - 9000 x 1012 mol C year-1\nFormula for photosynthesis - 6 CO2 + 12 H2O + Light - C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O\nWater = 9000 x 1012 mol H2O year-1 * 0.018 kg mol-1 = 162 x 1012 kg H2O year-1 (net)\nWater = 18000 x 1012 mol H2O year-1 * 0.018 kg mol-1 = 324 x 1012 kg H2O year-1 (gross)\nCO2 = 9000 x 1012 mol CO2 year -1 * 0.044 kg mol-1 = 396 x 1012 kg CO2 year -1\nO2 = 9000 x 1012 mol O2 year -1 * 0.032 kg mol-1 = 288 x 1012 kg O2 year -1\nb. The total mass of the Earth's atmosphere is approximately 5 x 1018 kg and composed of 78% Nitrogen,\n21% Oxygen, and 1% Argon. In what ways was the atmosphere of the Earth 4 billion years ago different\nthan it is today? Since there is still disagreement about Earth's early atmosphere, be sure to note sources in\nyour answer.\n1.\nEssentially devoid of oxygen - Des Marais 2005; Kump 2008\n2.\nHydrogen rich reducing environment composed of methane, ammonia, hydrogen, water - Miller and\nUrey 1953 from Chyba 2005; Tian et al. 2005 from Chyba 2005\n3.\nCO2 rich - Walker 1977 from Chyba 2005\n4.\nBefore core formation CH4 and NH3, after CO2 - Holland 1962 from Chyba 2005\n5.\nCO2 rich with 30% H2 - Tian et al. 2005 from Chyba 2005\nc. Calculate how many years it took for the current levels of O2 in the atmosphere to accumulate. Assume\nthat the early atmosphere contained no O2, photosynthesis started instantaneously at today's rate,\nphotosynthesis was constant in time, and that respiration was negligible. Is your answer reasonable? If\nnot, explain why.\n5 x 1018 kg * 0.21 = 1.05 x 1018 kg O2\n1.05 x 1018 kg O2 / 288 x 1012 kg O2 year -1 = 3645.8 years\nThis answer is unreasonable, in large part because of the assumptions included in the calculation. The\ndevelopment of photosynthesis at today's rate occurred over billions of years. During this time, complex,\nrespiring organisms were evolving, consuming much of the O2 produced by photosynthesis (today O2 levels\nare at an approximate steady state because of the balance of photosynthesis and respiration).\nNOTE: The composition of the atmosphere is given by volume. Technically, it should be given by mass.\nAny answers that try to convert from percentage by volume to percentage by mass are acceptable.\nd. Al Gore has hired you as a scientific consultant for his new movie, More Inconvenient Truths. While\nattending last Thursday's 1.018 lecture, Al heard Prof. Chisholm say that O2 levels are declining, but not by\nmuch. Al wants to incorporate this idea into his movie, but doesn't want to use \"scare tactics\". Find the\nrate at which O2 levels are declining (looking this number up is fine, but note sources) and explain to Al\nwhy this is occurring. Given your findings, should he include this as a detrimental effect of burning fossil\n\nfuels in his new movie? If so, why? If not, describe a mechanism by which O2 could be reduced\nsignificantly in the atmosphere. Your idea need not be likely, just possible.\nFrom 1991 - 2005, O2 levels have dropped 0.00248%\nhttp://www.mlo.noaa.gov/programs/coop/scripps/o2/o2.html\n0.00248% / 15 = 1.65 x 10-4 % year-1\n1.65 x 10-6 * 0.21 * 5 x 1018 kg = 1.735 x 1012 kg O2 year -1\nAssuming that the present rate of O2 depletion continues into the future, it will be ~600,000 years before we\nrun out of O2. Keeling calculates 50,000 years before we run out of O2, but regardless, we will use all of\nour fossil fuel resources long before we significantly deplete the O2 levels of the atmosphere.\nThe reduction in O2 is primarily occurring because of the combustion of fossil fuels, which requires O2.\nThis effect is somewhat offset by an apparent imbalance between photosynthesis and respiration. Based on\nthe above calculations, this should not be included as a detrimental effect of burning fossil fuels.\nO2 could be reduced significantly in the atmosphere if the major plant communities in the world collapsed.\nA widespread die-off of vegetation resulting from anthropogenic activities could significantly decrease the\nrate of photosynthesis in the world, causing a shortage of O2 for the remaining respiring organisms.\nNOTE: The composition of the atmosphere is given by volume. Technically, it should be given by mass.\nAny answers that try to convert from percentage by volume to percentage by mass are acceptable.\n3. (11 points)\na. You have decided to follow in your TA's footsteps and pursue a career in oceanography. Because you\nwere so inspired by 1.018, you are especially interested in the productivity of oceans due to their\nimportance on a global scale. You break the news to a fellow classmate who says, \"But don't oceans have\nthe same productivity as deserts? How could they possibly be important on a global scale?\" Explain how\nyou are both right.\nWhile it is true that open oceans have low productivity on a per area basis, because they occupy such a\nlarge percentage (~2/3) of the Earth's surface, they contribute nearly half of global NPP.\nb. Your discussion about oceans and aquatic ecosystems gets you thinking about how they compare with\nterrestrial systems. You remember from class that five of the major environmental determinants of\nproductivity are light, nutrients, temperature, CO2, and H2O. Your classmate creates the table below and\nasks you to fill in the factors that are most likely and least likely to limit primary production in the\nfollowing ecosystems:\nMost Likely\nLeast Likely\nBoreal Forest\nLight, Temperature, Nutrients\nCO2\nSewage Pond\nLight, Temperature\nH2O, Nutrients\nTropical Rainforest\nNutrients, Light\nH2O, CO2\nNorth Atlantic Ocean\nNutrients, Light\nH2O, CO2\nc. For each ecosystem give a one or two sentence explanation for why you chose which factors would be\nmost likely and least likely to limit primary production. State any assumptions you make about the\necosystems while assessing the importance of each factor.\nBoreal Forest - Boreal forests have light, temperature, and nutrients as their most limiting factors. Water is\nalso a limiting factor in some boreal forests, as plants have very little access to water in its liquid state.\nCO2 is plentiful.\n\nSewage Pond - In sewage ponds there is an excess of nutrients (N and P due to sewage, runoff) in water.\nHowever, the large amount of nutrients creates dense and dark water making light a limiting factor.\nTemperature is also a limiting factor in some cases, as biological oxidation processes are sensitive to\nextreme hot or cold. Note that O2 would likely be the key limiting factor in a sewage pond.\nTropical Rainforest - In this case nutrients would be more important than light because there is so much\nproductivity that nutrients are taken out of the soil very quickly. Light would also be a limiting factor\nbecause of the dense canopies. There is plenty of water and CO2 around from the rain and respiration of\nthe forest.\nNorth Atlantic Ocean - Nutrients and light are the two most limiting factors in this system. If one looks at\nthe surface of the North Atlantic, light is not a limiting factor, but nutrients are (shoreline or shallower\nareas are an exception as they have more nutrients and thus higher productivity). The deep North Atlantic\nhas next to no light reaching it and thus light would be a limiting factor in that case.\nd.

(6 points)\na. Name the two major biological processes that are responsible for the coupling between the oxygen and\ncarbon cycles. Write their reactions.\nPhotosynthesis: CO2 + H2O + light CH2O + O2\nRespiration: O2 + CH2O CO2 + H2O + energy/ATP\nb. You measure the CO2 concentration in the air over Alaska for one year and then plot your measured\nconcentration minus the average annual concentration as a function of time. Explain the seasonal variation\nin CO2 concentration illustrated in the figure below. Would you expect to see the same pattern if you\nmeasured CO2 in the atmosphere over Chile? Why or why not?\nThe increase in CO2 from January-April is due to atmospheric mixing and respiration. As trees start to\nphotosynthesize and the summer season begins, CO2 drawdown occurs, reaching a maximum in July-\nAugust. The inflection point in September-October is due to reduced photosynthesis and increased\nrespiration. Increasing CO2 in November-December is again due to atmospheric mixing and respiration. In\nChile, you would expect the seasonal cycle to be inverted with significantly dampened oscillations. This is\na product of opposite seasons and less landmass in the Southern Hemisphere.\nc. The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased drastically as a result of human activities over the\npast 100 years. In addition, the global O2 concentration in the atmosphere has decreased, as shown in the\ngraph below. Please explain the seasonal variation in each year and the overall 5-year trend in the figure.\nThe seasonality is a result of the production of O2 by photosynthesis. The overall 5-year trend is caused by\ndeforestation and the consumption of fossil fuels, which uses oxygen.\nGr\nap\nh\nof\no\nxyge\nn concentrat\ni\non f\nor 1991-1995.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n2. (7 points) You are a scientist studying elephant ecology in the Kibale Forest of Uganda. As part of your\nproject you have collected the following data:\nKibale Forest\nNet Primary Production\n856.0 kcal m-2 yr -1\nTotal Biomass of Elephants\n9.70 kcal m-2\nElephants\nFood Consumed (I)\n67.5 kcal m-2 yr -1\nFecal Material and Urine Lost (F)\n30.2 kcal m-2 yr -1\nMaintenance Metabolism (R)\n36.8 kcal m-2 yr -1\nGrowth (P)\n0.50 kcal m-2 yr -1\na. What is the exploitation efficiency of the elephants?\nNPP is rate of plant biomass production\nC.E. = plants consumed / total plants produced = 67.5 / 856 = 0.079 = 7.9%\nb. What is the assimilation efficiency of the elephants?\nA.E. = An / In\nAn = energy assimilated = energy ingested - energy lost in fecal material and urine = 67.5 - 30.2 = 37.3\nIn = food consumed = 67.5\nA.E. = 37.3 / 67.5 = 0.55 = 55%\nc.

(7 points) The population dynamics of a natural pond system are dictated solely by the food web pictured\nbelow. Water milfoil (Myriophyllum) is an invasive Eurasian genus of aquatic plants found in North\nAmerican lakes and ponds. Spirogyra is a form of filamentous green algae that are native to North\nAmerican freshwater ecosystems.\nTrout\nMosquito Larvae\nSnail\nDaphnia\nMilfoil\nSpirogyra\n\na. In order to help save the native Spirogyra population, you have a few measures available to you. You\ncan either adjust the trout population (by adding more trout or by encouraging more fishing) or you can\nadjust the mosquito larvae population (by adding more larvae or by applying a biocide that only kills\nmosquito larvae). Which measure would be most effective at increasing the population of Spirogyra?\nWhy? Clearly state all assumptions.\nIncreasing the population of mosquito larvae is the most direct method of increasing the population of\nSpirogyra. Increasing mosquito larvae will decrease the population of Daphnia, which feed exclusively on\nSpirogyra. There are a number of secondary effects that could be argued depending on the assumed time\nscale and response of populations.\nb. A golf course is built upstream of the pond. The fertilizers from the runoff cause a 50% increase in the\nprimary productivity of both milfoil and Spirogyra. By how much would you expect the productivity of\nsnails and Daphnia to increase? Assume the ecological efficiency at each trophic level is 10%. Show\ncalculations and explain your reasoning.\nThe productivity of snails and Daphnia will both increase by 50%. Assuming a trophic level transfer\nefficiency of 10%, we can project how the increase in productivity will cascade through the food web.\nP = total primary productivity before golf course and 1.5*P = total primary productivity after golf course\nProductivity of snails before golf course = 0.1*P\nProductivity of snails after golf course = 0.1*1.5*P\n% increase = 100*(0.1*1.5*P - 0.1*P)/(0.1*P) = 50%\n4. (6 points) Al Gore has another idea for his new movie, More Inconvenient Truths. He wants you to\nassess the impacts of climate change on the hydrologic cycle.\na. How is the hydrologic cycle expected to change over the next century? Be sure to note sources in your\nanswer.\nGlobal warming is expected to accelerate the hydrologic cycle, effectively increasing global\nevapotranspiration and precipitation. Some snowfall will become rainfall. The melting of the snowpack\nand spring flood will occur earlier. Semiarid regions are expected to experience more droughts. Sea level\nrise will result in saltwater intrusion of coastal aquifers.\nb. Approximately 23% of the energy available at the Earth's surface is used for evaporating water (either\nevaporation from free water surfaces or transpiration from plants). How much water, in km3 year -1, is\nevaporated? Assume the energy available at the surface of the Earth is 553 W m-2, the latent heat of\nvaporization is 2.5 x 106 J kg-1, the density of water is 1.0 x 1012 kg km-3, the radius of Earth is\n6.38 x 106 m, and there are 31,536,000 seconds in a year.\nEvap Energy = 0.23 * 553 W m-2 = 127 W m-2\n1 W m-2 = 1 J s-1 m-2\nSA Earth = 4 * π * (6.38 x 106)2 = 5.1 x 1014 m2\n(127 J s-1 m-2 * 31,536,000 s year-1 * 5.1 x 1014 m2) / 2.5 x 106 J kg-1 = 8.19 x 1017 kg\n8.19 x 1017 kg / 1.0 x 1012 kg km-3 = 8.19 x 105 km3\nc. Compare your answer to the values given by Oki and Kanae. Give three potential reasons why your\nanswer is different.\nOur calculation\n8.19 x 105 km3\nOki and Kanae\n436,500 + 65,500 = 5.02 x 105 km3\n\nGiven our assumptions, we are fairly close. But, there are many possible reasons we are overestimating.\nWe assume an unlimited supply of water and adequate transport of water vapor away from the evaporative\nsurface. We're using a ballpark estimate of the energy available at the Earth's surface and an average\ndensity and latent heat of vaporization for water.\ne. Al heard that climate change could lead to extensive droughts over the midwestern United States. The\nfigure below contains the difference between renewable freshwater resources (RFWR) of the future climate\n(predicted) and current climate for the months of June, July, and August in mm day-1. Should Al include\ndroughts over the Midwest in his movie? Why or why not? What negative impacts of climate change\nmight this figure miss? (Hint: Only the difference in 20-year averages of June, July, August RFWR is\nshown)\nAl cannot put droughts over the Midwest as a detrimental effect of climate change in his new movie. The\nincrease in precipitation is outpacing the increase in evapotranspiration, thus RFWR is increasing. A 20\nyear climatology does not adequately show extreme events (droughts and floods), which could have\ndevastating effects on agriculture. Also, this is a model prediction with many potential inaccuracies.\n5. (7 points) You're a consultant for ENVIRON and are hired to investigate the declining freshwater\nfisheries of Lake Redfield. You quickly determine that reduced fish populations are a result of low\ndissolved O2 levels caused by phytoplankton blooms. You measure the effluent of the wastewater\ntreatment plant and find an N:P = 4:1. You then measure runoff from an adjacent farm and determine the\nN:P ratio is 28:1. Carbon is plentiful. You sample the lake every week for one summer and plot your\nresults (black squares).

Assume the natural (before wastewater effluent and agriculture runoff) N:P ratio of Lake Redfield was\n16:1. Who should be blamed for the phytoplankton blooms, the farmer or the wastewater treatment plant?\nExplain your reasoning.\nBoth are responsible for the heightened productivity because the Redfield ratio is exactly 16:1. The\nwastewater treatment plant contributes phosphorous and the farm contributes nitrogen.\nb. The human population surrounding Lake Redfield doubles and the following year the phytoplankton\nblooms are even worse. You collect samples and plot your results (white circles). Is the lake nitrogen or\nphosphorous limited? Why?\nThe doubling of population increased the amount of wastewater effluent and thus the amount of\nphosphorous loading. Since the lake previously had an N:P ratio 16:1 and the ratio of N:P in wastewater\neffluent is 4:1, Lake Redfield is now nitrogen limited.\nc. How would you expect the composition of the phytoplankton community to change between these two\nsummers? (Hint: Think about different types phytoplankton)\nThe population of Cyanobacteria would increase because Lake Redfield is nitrogen limited. Cyanobacteria\nare capable of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere, and would therefore have a competitive advantage over\nother phytoplankton.\nd. Propose a solution to reduce the phytoplankton blooms in Lake Redfield.\nReduce the nutrient loading from the farm or wastewater treatment plant. The farm could use less fertilizer\nor treat runoff by nitrifying ammonia to nitrate and denitrifying nitrate to nitrogen gas. However, this is\nfairly impractical. Installing tertiary treatment to reduce the nitrogen and phosphorous loading from the\nwastewater treatment plant, which is a point source, would likely be much more cost effective.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.018J / 7.30J Ecology I: The Earth\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

You\ndecide to make a phosphorous-limited system.\na. You find some standard media that is designed to obtain maximum growth rates. What would you\nexpect the Redfield Ratio of this media to be? Is this acceptable for your experiment? Why or why not?\nGenerally, ecosystems require N and P at a ratio of 16:1, so you would expect maximum growth rates at\nN:P = 16:1. This is not acceptable for your experiment because a phosphorous-limited system is desired, so\nyou would need to increase the N:P ratio of the media, i.e. N:P = 16:0.001.\nb. You put 108 Prochlorococcus cells into your culture vessel, turn on the chemostat, and allow it to reach\nsteady state.

(6 points) On Prof. DeLong's recent trip to the Galapagos Islands he took some time to study the\npredation habits of carnivorous land iguanas. He noticed that the iguanas on Isabela Island eat a wide\nvariety of food, while on Hood Island they eat just one or two kinds of prey.\na. Explain why these differences in diet selection exist using the concepts presented in your lecture notes\nand textbook. Describe the conditions under which you would expect to find an iguana eating many or few\nkinds of prey.\n\nAccording to optimal foraging theory, the profitability of prey is the energy value per handling time (Th).\nWhen Th is much greater than search time, Ts, each prey must have a high energy value to make the\ninvestment of handling time worthwhile, so iguanas should be specialists. When Ts is much greater than\nTh, then even though the prey energy value may be low, consuming prey is profitable. Under these\nconditions a predator should be a generalist.\nDifferences in diet selection could also result from interspecific competition. If on Isabella Island iguanas\nare able to realize their entire fundamental niche, they will be able to eat a wide variety of food. If\ncompetition for food is high on Hood Island, iguanas will have a much smaller realized niche and only be\nable to successfully acquire a small range of prey species.\nb. On Hood Island, he observed that the iguanas are very efficient at eating centipedes. However, the\ncentipedes do not go extinct because they can maintain a small population in tiny holes that the iguanas\ncan't enter. Which of the following graphs represents this situation? Explain your selection and sketch the\noutcome on the figure.\nThe graph on the right represents the case of prey refuges, where a portion of the prey population is able to\nescape predation, even at high predator densities. The intersection of the predator isocline at the peak of\nthe prey isocline suggests a relatively efficient predator. As a result, both populations tend to oscillate in a\nstable manner.\nc. On closer investigation, Prof. DeLong discovered that when the centipede population density is low,\niguanas on this island eat almost exclusively beetles, while at moderate to high centipede population\ndensities, the iguanas eat almost exclusively centipedes. Draw the predation response to centipede density.\nBe sure to label your axes. Identify and explain this type of functional response.\nThis is a Type III functional response. The attack rate is very low at low prey densities, and then increases\nas prey increases. At high prey densities, handling time limits predation. In this case, the predator exhibits\nprey switching.\n\n2. (6 points) Briefly define and give an example of the following:\na. Character Displacement\nA gradual evolutionary separation of two species in morphology or physiology as an outcome of\ncompetition for a resource. An example is Darwin's finches. Competition has selected for different beak\nsizes in birds coexisting in the same area, a form of niche differentiation.\nb. Niche Overlap\nTwo or more species using a portion of the same resource, such as food. The amount of niche overlap is\nassumed to be proportional to the degree of competition for that resource. When fundamental niches\noverlap, some niche space is shared and some is exclusive, enabling the two species to coexist. Large niche\noverlap does not necessarily mean high competition. Competition occurs because of a shortage of\nresources. If there are abundant resources, then there may be extensive niche overlap between two species\nwith little competition. An example is the coexistence of the grasshopper sparrow and the savannah\nsparrow. The grasshopper sparrow and the savannah sparrow have overlap in territory size and vegetation\ncover.\nc. Competitive Exclusion Principle\nTwo competing species with identical ecological requirements cannot occupy the same area. If two\ncompeting species coexist in a stable environment, they do so as a result of differentiation of their realized\nniche. An example is Pyke's bumblebees, where bees that rely on the same size flower for food show\nnegative correlations in abundance.\n3. (5 points) Read the Byers 2000 paper, \"Competition Between Two Estuarine Snails:\nImplications for Invasions of Exotic Species\".\na. Identify and explain the type of competition described in this paper.\nExploitative competition occurs when one competitor has the superior capability to gather resources, as\nopposed to directly interfering with the other organism. The paper explains that exploitative competition\nhas two main components, the consumer's per capita consumption rate (α) and its conversion efficiency\n(ε). Usually these two components are combined into one equation that is density dependent, but in this\npaper they examine how each component differs between the two snail species.\nb. Write the Lotka-Volterra competition equation for Cerithidea californica in general terms.\ndNC.californica\ndt\n= rC.californicaNC.californica\nKC.californica \" NC.californica \"#NB.attramentaria\nKC.californica\n$\n%\n& &\n'\n(\n) )\nc. What is the invasion criteria described in the Byers paper? Define each variable. Explain which variable\nis the focus of this paper and why.\nm1/α1ε1 > m2/α2ε2\nSpecies two will win if it has a lower death rate (m2), a higher conversion efficiency (ε2), or a higher per\ncapita consumption rate (α2). This paper examines the conversion efficiency because even though both\nsnails had the same impact on food resources, the introduced/invasive species in this experiment was much\nbetter at converting resources, thus surviving and dominating over the native species.\n4. (9 points) Read the opinion piece by Olivia Judson entitled \"Humpty Dumpty and the Ghosts\". Write an\nopinion (~400 words) about how the concepts that you have learned in class relate and contribute to the\nexistence of Humpty Dumpty communities and Ghosts. Use specific examples from your readings and\nlecture notes to support your arguments. If you use any outside sources, please cite them.\nA few examples of concepts in class that could be related to the Judson article are described below:\n\nHumpty Dumpty Communities\nKeystone Species, Predator-Prey Models - Keystone species have a large influence on the structure and\nstability of an ecosystem. If these species are eliminated, the ecosystem is fundamentally changed and\n\"broken\" without any possibility for repair. Usually the keystone species is a predator. Once removed, the\norganisms that it suppresses through predation explode in population and outcompete other species. An\nexample of this is in California kelp forests, where sea otters are crucial to keeping sea urchins in check.\nWhen the sea otter population is reduced (by hunting, habitat degradation, etc.), urchins multiply and\nconsume the kelp forest. This removes habitat for organisms that live in the kelp forest and thus the\necosystem turns into an urchin barren. If one were to reintroduce kelp, urchins would consume it\nimmediately. If you try to reintroduce sea otters, they have no habitat (they also live in the kelp).\nFundamental vs. Realized Niches - When one species is removed from an ecosystem, other species on the\nsame trophic level (that they compete with) may expand their realized niches. These species now have the\npotential to evolve with the ecosystem and completely occupy/expand their fundamental niche, making it\nhard for the old species to move back in. This could potentially occur if one species of Darwin's finch\nwere removed from the Galapagos or a particular species was overfished.\nGhosts\nInvasive Species - When a new species is introduced to a system, it may push another species to extinction;\nhowever, the introduced species may go extinct shortly afterward. In the Byers paper there is a parasite\nthat leaves the invasive species of snails, B. attramentaria, essentially castrated and unable to reproduce. If\nthis parasite were to wipe out B. attramentaria after it outcompetes the native population, the ecosystem is\nfundamentally changed with neither snail present. Examples of exotic species introduced to systems in\nlecture tended to show that the invasive species became established and altered the system without\nbecoming ghosts, which supports the Judson's assertion that ghosts are relatively rare.\nNutrient Loading - Adding unnatural amounts of phosphate, nitrogen, or other nutrient (such as iron) can\ncreate abnormally large populations of organisms (e.g. phytoplankton, zooplankton, etc.). However,\nnutrient loading may be cyclic or short-lived, such that the large populations created by the loading\ndisappear, even though their presence may have significantly altered the food web through competition\nwith other organisms and utilization of nutrients.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.018J / 7.30J Ecology I: The Earth\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

(25 points) You are hired to develop and operate a wastewater treatment plant for a fertilizer\ncompany that produces an effluent high in ammonium. You are given two choices for breaking\ndown ammonium:\n-\nNH4\n+ + O2 - NO2\n(1)\n-\nNH4\n+ + NO2 - N2 + 2 H2O\n(2)\na.

(25 points) Jonathan and Skylar are trying to recreate the Early Earth experiment of Miller and\nUrey. They decide to use some air from outside Building 48, put it in a reaction chamber and\napply sparks. To Jonathan and Skylar's surprise, their results don't match up with those of Miller\nand Urey.\na. Describe what the air that Jonathan and Skylar added to their tank was composed of (rough\nproportions of major gases).\n78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, trace amounts of other gases.\n\nName: ____________________ Page 3\nb. Describe which gases Miller and Urey used (i.e. the gases of the early atmosphere) and explain\nwhat the Miller-Urey experiment found.\nMethane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), molecular hydrogen (H2), and water (H2O). By adding a spark\n(to simulate lightning), Miller and Urey created amino acids from simple organic molecules\nformed in the gas mixture (e.g. hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde).\nc. Why was the early atmosphere more conducive to the success of this experiment? Hint: you\nshould mention the properties of the gases in parts (a) and (b).\nThe early atmosphere, whether that described by Miller and Urey or in different proportions, did\nnot have oxygen. This lack of oxygen in the Earth's early atmosphere prohibited the formation of\ncomplex molecules. The Miller-Urey model is of a \"reducing\" atmosphere.\nd. The \"Great Oxygenation Event\" is one of the most important, yet poorly understood, events in\nthe Earth's history. Scientists use various indicators in the geologic record to determine when and\nwhy this occurred. Please check the boxes beside the factors that may be helpful in determining\nwhen the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere occurred.\n\nx Charcoal record to indicate large fires\n\nNitrogen concentrations derived from ice cores\n\nDeep ocean crust patterns\n\nx Record of fossilized phytoplankton\n\nMass-independent fractionation (MIF) of sulfur isotopes\nx\n\nRed banding in sedimentary geologic formations\nx\n\nFossil record of early eukaryotes\ne.

(25 points) In the aquatic ecosystem pictured below: (A) is the amount of CO2 reduced to\norganic carbon by phytoplankton; (B) is the amount of CO2 reduced to organic carbon by rooted\naquatic plants; (C) is the amount of organic carbon respired by phytoplankton; (D) is the amount\nof organic carbon respired by rooted aquatic plants; (E) is the respiration of the zooplankton,\nbacteria, and fish in the water; and (F) is the respiration of the mud-dwelling organisms and\nbacteria.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n\nName: ____________________ Page 4\na. For the whole ecosystem, write the equations (using the letters describe above) for:\nGross Primary Production\nNet Primary Production\nNet Community Production\nA + B\nA + B - C - D\nA + B - C - D - E - F\nb. A = 200,000 g C year-1; B = 20,000 g C year-1; C = 50,000 g C year-1; D = 50,000 g C year-1;\nNet Community Production = 2000 g C year-1; and Mean Residence Time = 0.15 years. Find the\ntotal biomass of the ecosystem. Show your work and state any assumptions made.\nMRT = Biomass/NPP\nNPP = 200,000 g C + 20,000 g C - 50,000 g C - 50,000 g C = 120,000 g C\nBiomass = MRT * NPP\nBiomass = 0.15 year * 120,000 g C year-1 = 18,000 g C\nc. You want to measure the productivity of a sample of surface water from the Charles River. At\n9 am you collect two 500 mL bottles of water, one completely opaque and one clear, measure\ntheir O2 content, seal them, and leave them in the river. 8 hours later you retrieve your samples\nand measure their O2 content (total amount of O2 in the 500 mL sample). Calculate the GPP in\ng C hour-1 of your water sample. The molecular weight of C is 12 g mol-1 and O2 is 32 g mol-1.\nTime\nOpaque\nClear\n9am\n1.0 mol O2\n1.0 mol O2\n5pm\n0.37 mol O2\n1.23 mol O2\nGross O2 produced = |clear ΔO2| + opaque ΔO2\n6 CO2 + 12 H2O + Light - C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O\nFor every 1 mole of O2 produced 1 mole of C is fixed.\nGPP = (0.23 mol O2 + 0.63 mol O2) * 1 mol C / 1 mol O2 *12 g mol-1 / 8 hours = 1.29 g C hour-1\nd. You now want to measure the productivity of the open ocean. Would you use the same\nmethod? If not, briefly describe the technique you would use.\nBecause the productivity of a sample taken from the open ocean is so low, you could not use the\nΔO2 technique. Even after days of incubation, there would be no discernable change in O2.\nInstead, you would use the 14C technique. This method uses radiolabeled CO2 to track the uptake\nof CO2 into organisms. By measuring the amount of 14CO2 reduced to 14C6H12O6 and 12CO2\navailable, as well as knowing the amount of 14CO2 added, the total amount of 12CO2 reduced to\nC6H12O6 can be determined.\ne. The figure below describes the change in above-ground net primary production with age for a\nstand of white spruce (Ryan et al. 1997). Explain how GPP and RA change over time by\nsketching them on the graph. Explain the trends below.\n\nName: ____________________ Page 5\nGPP\nRA\nGPP - Gross primary productivity increases until about year 70, and then levels off or decreases.\nAt this point the forest has fully matured and photosynthesis is limited (or reduced) by some\nfactor (e.g. nutrients, light, water).\nRA - RA shadows GPP as increasing photosynthesis requires more autotrophs, thus autotroph\nrespiration also increases until year 70. However, after year 70 RA levels off or decreases with\ndecreasing photosynthesis. Answers that describe RA as increasing after year 70 because carbon\nstored in roots and stems require greater maintenance respiration are acceptable.\nf. Describe how Net Community Production would change and why.\nNCP - Net community production will increase until year 70, and then decline to approximately\nzero as photosynthesis (GPP) equilibrates with respiration (RA + RH).\nBONUS (2 points): According to Remmert, why is ecological theory crucial to our continued\nexistence?\n\"We can live on earth under the conditions now prevailing, and under no others. As a pure\nscience, ecology is concerned with understanding the balance and turnover of matter and energy\nin nature. In its applied form, ecology faces the problem of discovering how the conditions\nessential for present-day life can be maintained.\"\n4. (10 points) Write in a metabolic process that is likely to take place in each environment listed\nin the table below. A list of metabolic processes is provided. Some processes may be used more\nthan once or not at all.\nEnvironment\nMetabolic Process\nDeep-sea hydrothermal vents\nSulfur/Sulfide Oxidation (CO Oxidation,\nMethanogenesis, Iron Oxidation, H2 Oxidation)\nAn aquarium filled with well-fed fish\nAmmonia Oxidation (Photosynthesis)\nTermite guts\nMethanogenesis\nThe surface of living stromatolites\nPhotosynthesis\nIron oxide particles in anoxic sediments\nIron Reduction\nMetabolic Processes: H2 Oxidation, Ammonia Oxidation, CO Oxidation, Methanogenesis, Iron\nOxidation, Sulfur/Sulfide Oxidation, Photosynthesis, Iron Reduction\n\nName: ____________________ Page 6\n5. (15 points) Your TAs have decided to take you to the Harvard Forest instead of Plum Island for\nthe class field trip. The diagram below indicates the general nitrogen cycle in this particular\necosystem.\nC\nA\nB\na. Label what form of nitrogen or what process is occurring at:\nA\nB\nC\nDead Organic N\nNH4\n+ (Ammonium)\nDenitrification\nb. On your field trip, the TAs take you to a part of the forest where a clear-cutting experiment is\nbeing conducted. One of the TAs notes that the soil is losing nitrogen to surface and groundwater\nrunoff. Explain why.\nInternal cycling of nitrogen is an important component of the terrestrial nitrogen budget. Plants\nare vital to this internal cycling, as they both assimilate dead organic nitrogen that has been\nmineralized to ammonium and nitrate that has been produced from nitrite by nitrifying bacteria.\nIf plants are not present to uptake and store nitrate and ammonium, they are leached from the soil.\nc. In what major ways does the nitrogen cycle differ from the phosphorous cycle? Specifically,\ncompare and contrast the flow of nitrogen and phosphorous through Earth's biosphere.\nNitrogen is plentiful and cycles readily throughout the biosphere. Humans can create ammonium\nfrom nitrogen gas using the Haber-Bosch process, and thus have an incredibly large influence on\nthe nitrogen cycle. Phosphorous, in contrast, is scarce and travels on a \"one-way street\" from\nsoils and rocks to the ocean. Humans also have a large impact on the phosphorous cycle.\nPhosphorous is mined to use in fertilizers, and while some phosphorous taken up by plants, much\nof it runs off to oceans where it is stored in relatively inaccessible marine sediments.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.018J / 7.30J Ecology I: The Earth\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

(10 Points) In your readings, Morton wrote: \"All over the world, by day and night, animals and\nbacteria and fungi and the plants themselves are using the oxygen which photosynthesis\nspits out into the atmosphere to turn organic material back into carbon dioxide and water. In\nso doing, they regenerate the energy the plants stored away. The two processes come close\nto canceling each other out. Today, though, things are out of balance.

(17 Points) Inspired by Priestley's experiment involving a mouse, a plant, and a glass jar, you\ndecide to build a self-sustaining closed system containing goldfish and aquatic plants.\n(i) (3 Points) What roles do the plants and fish play in your mini-ecosystem? How do they\ndepend on one another?\n(ii) (6 Points) Before you seal off the system, you decide to do some tests to make sure your\nsystem will be balanced, i.e. the mix of fish and plants is adequate. You do this by\ntemporarily placing the different components of your system into sealed containers and\nmeasuring the O2 concentration for three hours in the light and three hours in darkness.\nOn the axes below, sketch 3 graphs of the change in O2 over time that you expect to see\nfor the aquatic plants alone, the goldfish alone, and the aquatic plants and goldfish\ncombined.

The next day, though your plant looks\nhealthy, your fish is floating upside down. You know the water does not have\nanthropogenic toxins in it, because you just read a water quality report from the MDC.\nWhat do you hypothesize as the cause of death of the fish and why?\n\nName: ____________________ Page 6\n7. (16 Points) You are a limnologist studying several lakes in northern Ontario. The lakes have\nlittle input of nutrients from streams. You measure the concentrations of nitrate and\nphosphate every two months, and generate the following data. All units are in μg/L\nconcentration. Using the graph paper provided below may help you answer the question.\nTrout Lake\nBig Lake\nLake Balance\nNO3\n-\nPO4\nNO3\n-\nPO4\nNO3\n-\nPO4\nJanuary\nMarch\nMay\nJuly\nSeptember\nNovember\n\nName: ____________________ Page 7\n(i) (6 Points) Which lake is limited by the availability of P? By the availability of N? Explain\nyour answer.\n(ii) (4 Points) In which lake do you expect more blue-green algae (cyanobacteria)? Why?\n(iii) (3 Points) A resort-house development is proposed to be built around Lake Balance\nleading to the use of large numbers of septic systems around the lake. (Septic systems\nleach nitrogenous compounds into the groundwater, and the groundwater ultimately\ncarries them to the lake). Would Lake Balance start to look more like Trout Lake or Big\nLake over time?\n(iv) (3 Points) The development goes ahead, and the concentrations of NO3 in Lake Balance\nskyrocket. At the same time, the housing developments around the lake began to leach\nsewage into the lake, increasing its P supply. What might happen to the oxygen\nconcentrations in the deep waters of Lake Balance over time and why?\nWhat is this\nprocess called?\nBonus (1 Point): Using your answer to question one, answer the following bonus question: To\nmitigate the effects of the added nitrate from sewage coming from the new homes\nsurrounding Lake Balance, the local wastewater treatment authority proposes an\ninnovative solution. Rather than trying to install a sewer system across the entire,\nremote area, they propose using bacteria to convert the nitrate in groundwater to\nnitrogen gas. They set up one of these anaerobic bacterial growth systems and test\nit. Initially they find that there is a high rate of conversion to N2 gas, but these rates\nsoon slow down. The environment is still anaerobic. What would you recommend\nadding to the system to help enhance the rate of conversion from NO3\n- to N2 gas by\nthese bacteria?\n\nName: ____________________ Page 8\n8.

Explain your answer.\n9. (8 Points) You are a microbe and you go to the store where they are having a sale on\nelemental sulfur. You are thinking about buying some elemental sulfur to consume to make\nenergy. There's plenty of sulfur, but you need to buy something to go with it. All that's left at\nthe store besides sulfur is nitrate (NO3\n-) and succinate. You do have the recipe (i.e. genes) to\nconvert NO3\n- to N2 gas and to convert S to SO4\n2-. You also have a recipe to convert S to H2S\nand succinate to fumarate. Assume you can buy and react one mole of each in standard\nconditions. Should you buy the NO3\n- or the succinate if your goal is to maximize the amount\nof energy produced from one mole of sulfur?\n\nName: ____________________ Page 9\nBonus Problem (up to 5 points):\nThe Peak District Moorlands in the United Kingdom store 20 million tonnes of carbon, almost\nhalf of the carbon stored in the soils of the entire United Kingdom (the Moorlands are only 8%\nof the land area). In pristine condition, these peatlands can store an additional 13,000 tonnes\nof carbon per year.\n(i) Given this rate of productivity, how long did it take for the Peatlands to sequester this\nmuch carbon?\n(ii) What is the effective residence time of the carbon that makes it into long-term storage in\nthe peatland if no disturbance occurs? (Note: this is not a calculator problem!)\n(iii) The Peak District Moorlands store carbon because they are saturated with water. Based\non your knowledge of terminal electron acceptors and their efficiencies, why would this\ninhibit/slow respiration?\n(iv) One prediction of climate change models is a reduction in rainfall in England.

      "content": "Name: ____________________ Page 1\nEcology 1.018J/7.30\nQuiz 1\nOctober 2, 2008\nPlease put your name on every page!\nSpace is provided for your answers; if you need more room, use the back of the *same* page.\nThis exam is worth 100 points, with an additional 6 points of bonus problems.\nThe number of points assigned to each question roughly corresponds to the amount of time you\nshould spend answering it.\nEquations that may come in handy\nn = # e- transferred per mole of reductant\nΔE0' = E0'(oxidizing agent) - E0'(reducing agent)\nΔG0' = -nF(ΔE0')\nF = Faraday constant (23 kcal V-1 mol-1)\nΔG' = ΔGo' + RT ln ([C]c[D] d/[A] a[B]b)\nT = Temperature (K)\nR = gas constant (8.31 joules degree-1 mol-1)\naA +bB - cC + dD\n*A table of standard reduction potentials may be found on the last page of the exam.\n1. (9 Points) As you know, a group of organisms catalyze the oxidation of N compounds using\neither organic or inorganic carbon as their carbon source:\nNH4\n+ → NO2\n- → NO3\n- (uses inorganic carbon)\nwhile others catalyze their reduction:\nNO3\n- → NO2\n- → N2O → N2 (uses organic carbon)\n(i) (2 Points) What are each of these processes called?\nNitrification (oxidation) carried out by nitrifying bacteria\nDenitrification (reduction) carried out by denitrifying bacteria\n(ii) (2 Points) What is the \"metabolic classification\" of organisms that carry each of these\nprocesses out? List the carbon source and the redox transformation of carbon for each\nof the processes.\nnitrifying bacteria: chemosynthetic bacteria (aerobic autotrophs) oxidize ammonium and\nreduce CO2.\ndenitrifying bacteria: anaerobic respiration (heterotrophs) reduce nitrate and oxidize\norganic carbon\n(iii) (5 Points) How can each group of microbes \"make a living\" by doing essentially opposite\nthings? That is, how does each process benefit the organism that catalyzes it?\nNitrifying bacteria use energy from the oxidation of nitrogen compounds to reduce CO2\nto organic carbon, which they then use as their carbon source. Denitrifying bacteria get\ntheir energy and carbon from the organic compounds produced by autotrophs. They\noxidize organic compounds to CO2 for energy, using NO3\n- or NO2\n- as a final electron\nacceptor.\n2. Answer the following questions \"True\" or \"False\" (1 Point Each).\n___F___ The limiting factor for productivity in an ecosystem is always the element that is in\nlowest concentration.\n___T___ Net community production of an ecosystem can never be greater than net primary\nproduction.\n____F__ N-limited lakes will often be very clear because nothing can grow in them since they\nare so nutrient poor.\n____F__ Chlorophyll concentrations are maximal at the surface of the ocean where light\nintensity is greatest.\n___T___ The amount of gross primary production in a forest is equal to the amount of carbon\nfrom CO2 fixed by photosynthesis of plants and bacteria in the forest.\n\nName: ____________________ Page 2\n3. (14 Points) D. J. Des Marais diagrammed the history of the Earth as a clock in units of\nbillions of years ago (b.y.a.) (Science 289: 1703(2000)). A simplified version of this clock is\nreproduced below. The following questions refer to parts of the graph labeled with letters.\n(i) (1 Point) What appeared on Earth at \"A\"?\nLife\n(ii) (2 Points) What atmospheric event occurred at \"B\"? How did it affect life at that time?\nThe Great Oxygenation Event. Oxygen was toxic to many life forms, so they had to\nadapt.\n(iii) (2 Points) Describe the Earth's atmosphere at the highlighted region \"C\". What major\ngases were present?\nThe Earth's atmosphere was reducing. Methane, carbon dioxide, reduced forms of\nnitrogen, etc., were present. Oxygen was absent.\n(iv) (3 Points) Describe the Earth's atmosphere at \"D\". What factors led to the differences\nbetween the Earth's atmosphere between \"C\" and \"D\"?\nThe Earth's atmosphere was similar to today's with ~21% oxygen. The differences were\ncaused by the \"great oxygenation event\" and the emergence of photosynthesis.\n(v) (1 Point) Draw, based on this approximate scale, when on this \"clock\" humans appeared\non Earth.\n(vi) (5 Points) Your friend, a geologist, wants your help investigating an ancient rock with\ncurious banding and circular patterns. He has already demonstrated that the banding is\nnot iron. What point on this graph represents the time the rock might be from? How\nwould you test the origins of the patterning? What results would prove your hypothesis?\nThe rock might be from Point A, the origins of life. The banding could represent an\nancient stromatolite fossil. You could test the biological origins of life by looking at stable\nisotope fractionation. Specifically, you could look at δ13C: if the ratio was lower than\nexpected (i.e. the material is isotopically \"lighter\"), the material is probably of biological\norigin.\n\nName: ____________________ Page 3\n4. (11 Points) The graphs below describe the physical structure of two temperate lake\necosystems. I0=incident light intensity on the water surface.\nTemperature\nLog I0\n1% I0\nDepth\nTemperature\nLog I0\n1% I0\nDepth\nA\nB\n(i) (1 Point) Label zc, the compensation depth.\n(ii) (2 Points) Based on this information, which lake would you expect to produce the most\nphytoplankton and why?\nLake A would have the most phytoplankton because the cells never mix below the\ncompensation depth, and thus photosynthesis is always greater than respiration.\n(iii) (3 Points) Sketch on each of the graphs how you might expect the dissolved oxygen\nconcentration to vary with depth, and why?.\nIt would be even in the mixed layer, and decrease below that. Probably more in the\nmost productive lake, but you are going to have to be liberal in how you grade this.\n(iv) (5 Points) Were these profiles measured in the summer or winter? Why? How would\nthey differ if they had been measured six months earlier? (It may help you to diagram\nyour response.)\nThe profiles were measured in the summer because a thermocline is evident.\nThermoclines are thermal stratifications caused by warming of surface waters due to the\nabsorption of sunlight. If the profiles were measured in the winter, light attenuation\nwould be the same, but the thermal profile would be a straight line.\n\nName: ____________________ Page 4\n5. (10 Points) In your readings, Morton wrote: \"All over the world, by day and night, animals and\nbacteria and fungi and the plants themselves are using the oxygen which photosynthesis\nspits out into the atmosphere to turn organic material back into carbon dioxide and water. In\nso doing, they regenerate the energy the plants stored away. The two processes come close\nto canceling each other out. Today, though, things are out of balance. Today is a spring\nday...\"\n(i) (2 Points) Complete this thought with three sentences or more of your own to explain what\nis \"out of balance\".\nIn spring, plants are growing, so plants must photosynthesize more than they respire in\norder to make biomass. There is a draw down in CO2 from the atmosphere as\nphotosynthesis fixes more carbon from the atmosphere than respiration respires. This\nmeans that the whole cumminity is adding carbon (energy) in the spring, and the NCP will\nbe positive.\n(ii) (2 Points) What are the animals, bacteria and fungi \"using the oxygen\" for?\nThey are using oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor to oxidize organic carbon to use it\nas energy\n(iii) (2 Points) If the two processes Morton describes do \"cancel each other out\", can NPP still\nbe positive? Justify your answer.\nYes. NPP is GPP-Ra. This term could still be positive (the plants themselves could keep\ngrowing), even if the overall NCP is zero because of the respiration of heterotrophs.\n(iv) (2 Points) Over Earth's history, have these processes always canceled each other out?\nExplain your answer.\nNo. The oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere occurred because the process of\nphotosynthesis far outstripped the process of respiration on the global scale leading to an\nincrease in oxygen in the atmosphere and leading to organic carbon being stored below\nground in the form of \"ancient photosynthetically fixed carbon\"\n(v) (2 Points) Morton talks about \"Eating the Sun.\" Explain what he means by this.\nHe means that photosynthesis uses light energy to convert CO2 into reduced organic\ncarbon compounds (sugars) which are either used by the plants own respiration or used\nas the energy source in heterotrophic respiration, including our own. This means that the\nenergy used for the life of heterotrophs originally came in the form of light from the Sun.\n\nName: ____________________ Page 5\n6. (17 Points) Inspired by Priestley's experiment involving a mouse, a plant, and a glass jar, you\ndecide to build a self-sustaining closed system containing goldfish and aquatic plants.\n(i) (3 Points) What roles do the plants and fish play in your mini-ecosystem? How do they\ndepend on one another?\nThe plants are the primary producers (autotrophs) , fixing CO2 and releasing oxygen.\nThe fish are the Heterotrophs, consuming O2 to break down the products of the plants.\nThe two organisms complement each other by cycling carbon and oxygen back and forth\nbetween them.\n(ii) (6 Points) Before you seal off the system, you decide to do some tests to make sure your\nsystem will be balanced, i.e. the mix of fish and plants is adequate. You do this by\ntemporarily placing the different components of your system into sealed containers and\nmeasuring the O2 concentration for three hours in the light and three hours in darkness.\nOn the axes below, sketch 3 graphs of the change in O2 over time that you expect to see\nfor the aquatic plants alone, the goldfish alone, and the aquatic plants and goldfish\ncombined. Assume you are using sterile water.\nO2 Concentration\n(pg O2 L-1)\nLight\nDark\nTime (hours)\n(iii) (6 Points) Explain the features of your graphs.\n(iv) (2 Points) You decide you are ready to assemble the final system, but you are very tired\nfrom all of your problem sets and accidentally fill the container with water from the\nCharles River and leave it in the dark overnight. The next day, though your plant looks\nhealthy, your fish is floating upside down. You know the water does not have\nanthropogenic toxins in it, because you just read a water quality report from the MDC.\nWhat do you hypothesize as the cause of death of the fish and why?\nThe Charles River water had a lot of organic matter and microbes decomposing it. The\nmicrobes used up all the oxygen and the fish suffocated.\n\nName: ____________________ Page 6\n7. (16 Points) You are a limnologist studying several lakes in northern Ontario. The lakes have\nlittle input of nutrients from streams. You measure the concentrations of nitrate and\nphosphate every two months, and generate the following data. All units are in μg/L\nconcentration. Using the graph paper provided below may help you answer the question.\nTrout Lake\nBig Lake\nLake Balance\nNO3\n-\nPO4\nNO3\n-\nPO4\nNO3\n-\nPO4\nJanuary\nMarch\nMay\nJuly\nSeptember\nNovember\n\nName: ____________________ Page 7\n(i) (6 Points) Which lake is limited by the availability of P? By the availability of N? Explain\nyour answer.\nP-limited: Trout Lake - because the intercept is on the y axis... indicating that when P\nruns out, there is still N in the lake.\nN-limited: Big Lake - because the intercept is the P axis\nThe Redfield Ratio for N:P is 16:1. Whenever the ratio exceeds 16 (as in Trout Lake),\nphosphorous is limiting. When the ratio is less than 16, nitrogen is limiting.\n(ii) (4 Points) In which lake do you expect more blue-green algae (cyanobacteria)? Why?\nMore cyanobacteria would be present in Big Lake because it is N-limited. Cyanobacteria\nare capable of fixing nitrogen, so they would have a competitive advantage over other\nalgae in a nitrogen-limited system. (See in-class example of Lake Washington).\n(iii) (3 Points) A resort-house development is proposed to be built around Lake Balance\nleading to the use of large numbers of septic systems around the lake. (Septic systems\nleach nitrogenous compounds into the groundwater, and the groundwater ultimately\ncarries them to the lake). Would Lake Balance start to look more like Trout Lake or Big\nLake over time?\nLake Balance would start to look more like Trout Lake because Trout Lake is P-limited.\nThe septic systems are leaching nitrogen-bearing compounds into the water, making\nLake Balance enriched in nitrogen with respect to phosphorous.\n(iv) (3 Points) The development goes ahead, and the concentrations of NO3 in Lake Balance\nskyrocket. At the same time, the housing developments around the lake began to leach\nsewage into the lake, increasing its P supply. What might happen to the oxygen\nconcentrations in the deep waters of Lake Balance over time and why?\nWhat is this\nprocess called?\nOxygen concentrations will decline, especially in the deep waters of the lake. The added\nnutrients cause blooms of algae, which increase the primary productivity of the lake.\nWhen the algae die, they sink towards the bottom and are decomposed by heterotrophs,\nwhich consume oxygen as they decompose the organic carbon produced by the algae.\nThis is Cultural Eutrophication,\nBonus (1 Point): To mitigate the effects of the added nitrate from sewage coming from the\nnew homes surrounding Lake Balance, the local wastewater treatment authority proposes\nan innovative solution. Rather than trying to install a sewer system across the entire,\nremote area, they propose using denitrifying bacteria to convert the nitrate in groundwater\nto nitrogen gas. They set up an anaerobic ground system and test it. Initially they find\nthat there are fast rates of denitrification, but these rates soon slow down. There is still a\nlot of nitrate to be reduced and the environment is still anaerobic. What would you\nrecommend adding to the system to help spur further denitrification?\nOrganic carbon\n\nName: ____________________ Page 8\n8. (8 Points) Given the following data from an Experimental Forest, answer the following\nquestions. Show your work and units.\nTotal vegetative biomass\n80,000 kcal m-2\nDetritus and organic matter in soil\n120,000 kcal m-2\nTotal Gross Primary Productivity\n20,000 kcal m-2 yr -1\nTotal Plant Respiration\n5,000 kcal m-2 yr -1\nTotal Community Respiration\n9,000 kcal m-2yr -1\n(i) (2 Points) What is the net primary productivity of the forest?\nNPP = GPP - RA = 20,000 - 5,000 = 15,000 kcal m-2 yr -1\n(ii) (2 Points) What is the net community production?\nNCP = GPP - RA - RH = 20,000 - 9000 = 11,000 kcal m-2 yr -1\n(iii) (2 Points) What is the mean residence time of carbon in the vegetative biomass?\nMRT = biomass / NPP = 80,000/15,000 = 5.3 years\n(iv) (2 Points) Is this a fully mature forest? Explain your answer.\nno. NCP > 0\n9. (8 Points) You are a microbe and you go to the store where they are having a sale on\nelemental sulfur. You are thinking about buying some elemental sulfur to consume to make\nenergy. There's plenty of sulfur, but you need to buy something to go with it. All that's left at\nthe store besides sulfur is nitrate (NO3\n-) and succinate. You do have the recipe (i.e. genes) to\nconvert NO3\n- to N2 gas and to convert S to SO4\n2-. You also have a recipe to convert S to H2S\nand succinate to fumarate. Assume you can buy and react one mole of each in standard\nconditions. Should you buy the NO3\n- or the succinate if your goal is to maximize the amount\nof energy produced from one mole of sulfur?\n1) SO4\n2- + 8H+ +6e- -> S0 + 4H2O -0.20V\n2) NO3- + 6H++ 6 e- -> 1/2N2 + 3H2O +0.75V\n3) fumarate+ 2 H+ +2e- succinate = +0.031V\n4) S + 2 H+ +2e- -> H2S -0.243 V\nFor the coupled sulfur oxidation and denitrification:\ndE=0.75-(-0.20)= 0.95 E\ndG=-8*93.67*0.95= -711.892 kj/mol\nFor the coupled sulfur reduction and fumarate oxidation\ndE=-0.243-(0.031)= -0.274 E\ndG=-2*93.67*-0.274= 51.33kJ/mol\nYou should buy the nitrate.\n\nName: ____________________ Page 9\nBonus Problem (up to 5 points):\nThe Peak District Moorlands in the United Kingdom store 20 million tonnes of carbon, almost\nhalf of the carbon stored in the soils of the entire United Kingdom (the Moorlands are only 8%\nof the land area). In pristine condition, these peatlands can store an additional 13,000 tonnes\nof carbon per year.\n(i) Given this rate of productivity, how long did it take for the Peatlands to sequester this\nmuch carbon?\n20,000,000 tonnes C / 13,000 tonnes C yr-1 = 1538 years\n(ii) What is the effective residence time of the carbon that makes it into long-term storage in\nthe peatland if no disturbance occurs? (Note: this is not a calculator problem!)\nTheoretically, infinite: the net community productivity is stored in peat indefinitely.\n(iii) The Peak District Moorlands store carbon because they are saturated with water. Based\non your knowledge of terminal electron acceptors and their efficiencies, why would this\ninhibit/slow respiration?\nOxygen is the best electron acceptor, but in a saturated wetland anaerobic conditions\nprevail. Therefore, organisms experience slower rates of respiration because they grow\nmore slowly using \"poorer\" metabolic pathways.\n(iv) One prediction of climate change models is a reduction in rainfall in England. This would\ntransform the Moorlands into a carbon source, emitting up to 381,000 tonnes of carbon\nper year. How many years would it take to respire all the carbon stored in the Peak\nDistrict Moorlands?\n20,000,000 tonnes C / 381,000 tonnes C yr-1 = 52.5 years!!!!\n\n-\n-\nName: ____________________ Page 10\nTable 1.\nStandard reduction potential (E0\n') values (at 25oC and pH 7)\nHalf-Reaction\nEo\n' (V)\n1/2 O2 + 2 H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nH2O\n+0.816\nFe3+ + e -\n⇒\nFe2+\n+0.771\n-\nNO3 + 5 H+ + 6 e-\n⇒\n1⁄2 N2 + 3 H2O\n+0.75\nNO3 + 2 H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nNO2 + H2O\n+0.421\n-\nNO3 + 10 H+ + 8 e-\n⇒\nNH4\n+ + 3 H2O\n+0.36\nNO2- + 8 H+ + 6 e-\n⇒\nNH4\n+ + 2 H2O\n+0.34\nCH3OH + 2 H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nCH4 + H2O\n+0.17\nfumarate + 2 H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nsuccinate\n+0.031\n2 H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nH2 (pH 0)\n+0.00\noxaloacetate + 2 H++ 2 e-\n⇒\nmalate\n-0.166\nCH2O + 2 H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nCH3OH\n-0.18\npyruvate + 2 H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nlactate\n-0.185\nacetaldehyde + 2 H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nethanol\n-0.197\nSO4\n2- + 8 H+ + 6 e-\n⇒\nS + 4 H2O\n-0.20\nSO4\n2- + 10 H+ + 8 e-\n⇒\nH2S + 4 H2O\n-0.21\nFAD + 2 H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nFADH2\n-0.219\nCO2 + 8 H+ + 8 e-\n⇒\nCH4 + 2 H2O\n-0.24\nS + 2 H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nH2S\n-0.243\nN2 + 8 H+ + 6 e-\n⇒\n2 NH4\n+\n-0.28\nNAD+ + H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nNADH\n-0.320\nNADP+ + H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nNADPH\n-0.324\n2 H+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nH2 (pH 7)\n-0.414\nCO2 + 4 H+ + 4 e-\n⇒\n1/6 glucose + H2O\n-0.43\nFe2+ + 2 e-\n⇒\nFe\n-0.85\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.018J / 7.30J Ecology I: The Earth\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Onondaga Lake is phosphorous limited, therefore the contribution of\nphosphorous by METRO is causing the eutrophication.\ne) Sketch one line showing the nutrient (PO4\n3-, NO3\n-) concentration with ocean depth and another\nshowing the concentration of oxygen with ocean depth.

The figure below shows the latitudinal distribution of the global total (land plus ocean) NPP\n(solid line), land total NPP (dotted line), and ocean total NPP (dashed line). How does NPP relate\nto the carbon cycle? What features of the Earth system are responsible for the peaks in NPP at A,\nB, and C?\nNPP describes the amount carbon (as CO2) removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis.\nA - In the Northern Hemisphere, you have production in both the oceans (North Atlantic) and\nseasonal forests during the spring, summer, and fall.\nB - Tropical rainforests are productive ecosystems throughout the year. Oceans also contribute,\nbut the signal is controlled by terrestrial NPP.\nC - Productivity in the Southern Ocean dominates at latitudes south of 30oS.\nc. Critique the following statement using your knowledge of the carbon cycle and the figure\nbelow. \"I don't see any cause for alarm regarding the human contribution of CO2 to the\natmosphere. In ppm, it is only slightly larger than the annual cycle and the concentration of CO2\nhas been much higher on Glacial-Interglacial timescales.\"\nThe amplitude is on a log scale, so \"slightly larger\" is significant in terms of actual carbon\nconcentrations. Additionally, the annual cycle is the Earth \"breathing\", so having an effect on\nthat scale is considerable. Dismissing the impact of humans using the argument of higher\nGlacial-Interglacial fluctuations of CO2 is flawed for two primary reasons. First, humans would\nhave a difficult time adapting to climate changes similar in magnitude to an Ice Age. Second,\nhumans have had a comparable impact on the concentration of CO2 in approximately 100 years\nthat Glacial-Interglacial phenomena have had on timescales of 100,000 years.\nGrap\nh of\nlat\nitud\ni\nnal\ndi\nstr\nibu\nt\ni\non of land and water.\nGra\nph\nof\nCO2\ndi\nstu\nrban\nces\nby\namp\nlit\nude\nan\nd y\near\ns f\nor\ngla\ncial\n-int\nergl\nacial periods, human\nperterbation, ann\nual cycle, a\nnd diurnal cy\ncle.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nName: ____________________ Page 4\nd. Iron ocean fertilization is one geoengineering scheme proposed for removing carbon dioxide\nfrom the atmosphere. Briefly describe how, according to this scheme, CO2 is drawn from the air\ninto the ocean, how CO2 is partitioned/cycled after it enters the ocean, and how it is ultimately\nsequestered in the deep ocean.\nIn high-nutrient low-chlorophyll waters, iron can be used to create phytoplankton blooms, pulling\nCO2 out of the atmosphere via the process of photosynthesis. Much of this is regenerated in\nsurface waters and released back to the atmosphere. But some, roughly 1/3 (debated number), of\nthat organic carbon sinks through the mixed layer and thermocline to eventually be sequestered in\nthe deep ocean.\n3.

Explain your reasoning in one sentence.\nSeeds: cannot predict. More mice but fewer rats. Without information about relatively how\nmuch both of these consumers eat, it is not possible to know the effect on seeds.\nRats: decrease. Their main predator has increased.\nMice: increase. The decrease in rats means less direct competition by chasing and less\ncompetition for seeds.\nRaccoons: increase. Their main predator has been reduced.\n4. (30 points) Over IAP, Jonathan and Skylar decide to go on a sea monster diving tour of the\nCaribbean. To their delight, they've come across a pygmy Kraken population. Skylar decides they\nshould use a mark and recapture method to determine the population size. They catch, mark, and\nrelease 100 pygmy Krakens. Several weeks later, they catch 100 pygmy Krakens again. 10 of\nthem are marked.\na) Using the data gathered from this method, approximately how many pygmy Krakens are in the\npopulation?\n100/N = 10/100\nN = 100*(100/10) = 1000 Krakens\nb) What are some potential problems with the accuracy of the mark and recapture method?\nBiased sampling, removal of marks and emigration, immigration, births, deaths between\nsampling.\nc) Jonathan and Skylar obtain data to construct a life table.

Is he right? Why or why not?\nLife expectancy can be thought of more as a probability distribution; while some pygmy Krakens\nmay live 3 years, most don't. The life expectancy for a newborn pygmy Kraken is 0.71 years.\ne) Skylar wants to know what the survivorship curve would look like for this species. Please draw\nthe survivorship curve and identify its type. Explain what this means about the species.\nA Type II curve indicates that the rate of survivorship is fairly constant at all ages.\nThe graph below depicts the growth of a Kraken population.\nf) Mark the location of the carrying capacity on the \"Population\" axis (rough estimate). Briefly\nexplain why the population growth curve is shaped like this.\nThe population grew larger than its carrying capacity (K), which is set by environmental\nlimitations (food, predation, nutrients, habitat space, etc.).

By the availability of N? Explain your answer.\nP-limited: Trout Lake - because the intercept is on the y axis, indicating that when P runs out,\nthere is still N in the lake. Alternatively, you can just calculate the N:P ratios for a few points\nN-limited: Big Lake - because the intercept is the P axis. Alternatively, you can just calculate the\nN:P ratios for a few points\nThe Redfield Ratio for N:P is 16:1. Whenever the ratio exceeds 16 (as in Trout Lake),\nphosphorous is limiting. When the ratio is less than 16, nitrogen is limiting.\nb) A resort-house development is proposed to be built around Lake Balance leading to the use\nof large numbers of septic systems around the lake. (Septic systems leach nitrogenous\ncompounds into the groundwater, and the groundwater ultimately carries them to the lake).\nWould Lake Balance start to look more like Trout Lake or Big Lake over time?\nLake Balance would start to look more like Trout Lake because Trout Lake is P-limited. The\nseptic systems are leaching nitrogen-bearing compounds into the water, making Lake Balance\nenriched in nitrogen with respect to phosphorous.\nc) The development goes ahead, and the concentrations of NO3 in Lake Balance skyrocket. At\nthe same time, the housing developments around the lake began to leach sewage into the lake,\nincreasing its P supply. What might happen to the oxygen concentrations in the deep waters of\nLake Balance over time and why?\nWhat is this process called?\nOxygen concentrations will decline, especially in the deep waters of the lake. The added\nnutrients cause blooms of algae, which increase the primary productivity of the lake. When the\nalgae die, they sink towards the bottom and are decomposed by heterotrophs, which consume\noxygen as they decompose the organic carbon produced by the algae.

There is still a lot of nitrate to be reduced and\nthe environment is still anaerobic. What would you recommend adding to the system to help\nspur further denitrification?\nOrganic carbon\n2. With respect to the carbon cycle, please answer each of the following questions in a\nsentence or two:\na) Which 'compartment', terrestrial or marine, has the slowest biological carbon turnover?\nWhy do these compartments differ in terms of organic carbon turnovers?\nThe terrestrial compartment has the slowest biological carbon turnover because the primary\nproducers on land (trees, etc.) have longer lifespans than primary producers in the ocean\n(phytoplankton). Thus, once fixed, carbon stays in the biomass for longer. Note: although the\nbiological pump may sequester a small amount of carbon by sinking of phytoplankton, this\namount is so small that it doesn't change the mean residence time of carbon substantially.\nb) Which has the longest mean residence time for CO2, the deep-sea, or ocean surface waters?\nWhy ?\nThe deep-sea. Downwelling at the poles brings cold water (in which dissolved gases are more\nsoluble) deep into the ocean basins. Here, the water cannot undergo air-sea exchange since it\n\nis sealed off from contact with the atmosphere. This is the so-called \"physical pump\" of carbon\ndioxide.\nc) Fossil fuel burning and deforestation release about 9.1 petagrams of CO2 per year. In which\ncompartments (atmosphere, ocean, etc) does the manmade CO2 end up in, and in\napproximately what proportions?\nAbout 4.1 Pg remains in the atmosphere, 2.2 Pg is absorbed into the ocean, 0.7 is absorbed by\nland and 2.1 Pg is unaccounted for - and may wind up in the sediments or terrestrial biomass.\nd) What explains the trends shown in annual CO2 variation in the plot below? (Explain the\ntrend in both the spatial, and the temporal variation).\nSpatial variation: The Northern hemisphere has more land mass (and therefore, greater primary\nproductivity) and this land mass is concentrated at higher latitudes, where it experiences greater\nseasonal variation.\nTemporal variation: In summer (May-September in the Northern hemisphere; the opposite in the\nSouthern hemisphere), carbon dioxide is sequestered through photosynthesis so there is a\n\"valley\" in CO2 concentrations. In fall and winter, CO2 is released by decomposition and\nanthropogenic activity, so CO2 concentrations increase.\n3. In class and in your readings, you learned about the long-term ecological experimentation\ndone at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire.\na) Explain the biogeochemical mechanisms by which clear-cutting leads to increased NO3\nleaching from forest soils.\nClear cutting contributes to the buildup of ammonium in soils that are warm and moist. This\nstimulates nitrification by microbes, creating a much larger nitrate pool in the soil. The nitrate is\nnegatively charged (compared to ammonium which is positively charged) and thus is not held by\n\nthe negatively charged soil particles. Increased runoff of water from the system leaches this\nincreased nitrate out.\nb) Explain biogeochemically why there is more Ca2+ ion leaching from clear-cut forests.\nThe process of nitrification also acidifies, which creates more hyrdrogen ions that replace Ca2+\ncations and leach it from the system with increased runoff.\nc) Over the last fifty years, even in intact forests ,Ca2+has been depleted from the soils. Explain\nwhat was the ultimate cause of this depletion, and how it caused it.\nAcid rain from sulfur dioxide emissions in industry. The hydrogen ions replace calcium cations at\nion exchange sites in the soil, creating calcium leaching.\nd) What is wollastonite (exact chemical formula), what were they doing with it at Hubbard Brook\nand why?\nCaSiO3. It is a calcium mineral they were fertilizing forests from helicopter with in order to\nmeasure the effect of replacing the leached calcium on productivity (thereby determining how\nthe leached calcium from the soil due to acid rain was affecting the forest). The graphs\npresented in class showed both that calcium concentrations had increased after fertilization and\nthat it had become incorporated into biomass.\n4. Below is a table of the annual fish catch from an ocean basin that is a self-contained\necosystem. It has roughly yielded this catch for over a decade. A local ecology class has\nestimated the primary productivity of the basin to be around 2 x 107 metric tons of carbon. You\ndo a quick check to see if their measurements are in the right ballpark.

By calculation:\nFlounder and catfish TL=2:\n50x103 tons / (0.10) = 500x103 tons\n30x103 /(0.10) = 300x103 tons\nCod TL=3:\n100x103/(0.10x0.10) = 10,000x103 tons\nBluefish TL=4\n10x103/(0.10x0.10x0.10) = 10,000x103 tons\nTotal this is 20,800x103 tons or 2.08x107 tons of carbon harvested. This is equal (approximately)\nto the estimate for the total primary production in the system. (2x107 tons carbon). However, if\nall of the primary productivity is harvested each year through the fish catch, there would be no\nstock of fish to replace them the next year. We are harvesting the entire system and removing it\n\nfrom the system leaving no biomass left to spawn, etc. This should be straightforward from the\nBeddington and Pauly readings: estimates range from 2% in open ocean to an alarming 24-35%\nof PP required to support coastal fisheries. If the fishery represents 100% of the PP, this is a\ndisaster. 8% PP required is the global estimate.\n5.

You have decided to go into the ferret meat business on the small island described above. At\nwhat density should you maintain the ferrets in order to have the maximum output of ferrets?\nExplain your answer.\nYou should maintain the ferrets at a density of 1300/2 or 650 ferrets because this is the point\nwhere production (dN/dt) is maximal (from second derivative).\n\n7.

(10 points) Answer the following questions using one sentence:\nWhy do cyanobacteria bloom in lakes that are enriched with phosphorus?\nWhen the phosphorous limitation is removed, nitrogen often becomes limiting and some\ncyanobacteria are able to fix nitrogen, thus giving them a competitive advantage in\nnitrogen-limited systems.\nCan a lake have a Redfield Ratio of C:N:P of 106:16:1 and still be eutrophic? How?\nYes, adding large quantities of nitrogen and phosphorous to a lake will make it eutrophic,\neven if added at a ratio of 16:1.\nWhy is the O2 minimum in oceans just below the thermocline?\nAs organic compounds settle out of the mixed layer (which is equilibrated with the O2 in\nthe atmosphere), they are oxidized and O2 is consumed at a rate greater than it is\nproduced (if there is light), and these waters are isolated from the atmosphere so there is a\nnet loss.\nWhy is iron a limiting nutrient in some ocean ecosystems but not in lakes?\nIron is transported to ecosystems by wind-blown dust and cycled from sediment.\nList three differences between the biogeochemistry of the clear-cut and control\nwatersheds at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest.\nIncreased surface runoff, nitrate output, leaching of cations.\nBONUS (2 points): What seminal scientific contribution did researchers at Hubbard\nBrook make in the 1970s?\nResearchers at Hubbard Brook detailed the many negative effects of acid rain on NE\nforested ecosystems.\n4. (8 points) Kate and Emily are devising an evil scheme to take over the world. They\nwant to create a new type of super-organism that will outcompete all others.\nAdditionally, they want their super-organism to produce hydrogen sulfide as a by-product\nbecause it is toxic.\nKate finds two half reactions with hydrogen sulfide as a product:\nSO4\n2- + 10 H+ + 8 e- - H2S + 4 H20\n-0.210 V\nS + 2 H+ + 2 e- - H2S\n-0.243 V\nEmily wants to couple one of the above reactions with either:\n2 H+ + 2 e- - H2\n-0.414 V\nCO2 + 4 H+ + 4 e- - 1/6 C6H12O6 + H2O\n-0.430 V\n\nName: ____________________ Page 4\nPick which reaction is most energetically favorable (show work).\nSO4\n2- & H2: ΔGo\n' = -8F * (-0.210 + 0.414) = -1.63F\nSO4\n2- & C6H12O6: ΔGo\n' = -8F * (-0.210 + 0.430) = -1.76F = -169.8 kJ V-1 mol-1\n'\nS & H2: ΔGo = -2F * (-0.243 + 0.414) = -0.34F\n'\nS & C6H12O6: ΔGo = -4F * (-0.243 + 0.430) = -0.75F\n5. (15 points) You have developed a pilot scale algal production system designed to study\nhow you might maximize the production of lipids by algae for use in biofuels. You have\nlearned that if you grow the cells in a nitrogen-limited chemostat, they are likely to\nproduce more lipids per cell, so you decide to set this system up. You have three\ndifferent culture media available to you, with the following compositions:\nConcentration μg/L\nA\nB\nC\nNitrogen\nPhosphorus\nIron\n0.05\n0.04\n0.005\nNOTE: In the answers below, be sure to include units. Also show your reasoning. The\nactual answer is not as important as how you arrived at it.\na) Which medium would you use to set up your chemostat? Why?\nMedium B, N:P ratio is around 8:1\nb) You have an old broken down pump, and it can only pump media into the chemostat at\none speed: 200 L per day. What volume of culture would you set up if you wanted your\ncells to grow at a specific growth rate, r, of 0.8 day -1?\nr = D in steady state, and D = f/V\nV=f/D\nV = 200L day-1/0.8 day-1 = 250 L\nc) At this growth rate, and with the media you selected, you find that there are 105 cells\nper L in your culture. How much nitrogen is there in each cell?\nQ = (Si - S)/N and S is negligible, so Q = Si/N\nQ = (32 μg/L)/(105 cells/L) = 3.2 x 10-4 μg/cell\nd) Your boss is not satisfied with the yield from your chemostat. How would you\nincrease it?\nIncrease all nutrients in Si. The system must remain nitrogen-limited.\nN = Si/Q\n\nName: ____________________ Page 5\ne) Your boss still isn't satisfied. She buys you a pump that actually has variable speeds.\nHow would you determine the maximum pumping rate you could use to produce the most\namount of biomass per unit time?\nDial up the speed and bring the culture to steady state at each incremental speed until you\nreach one that washes the cells out. The max steady state production of cells would be at\nthe dilution rate, D, that is right below rmax. Or determine rmax in batch culture and set the\ndilution rate right below it.\n6. (15 points) In the summer of 2010, Skylar decides to return to Chesapeake Bay to\nparticipate in a study of salt marshes. In the first part of the study, Skylar is asked to\nexamine the profiles of two different marine inlets of the salt marshes (shown below). Io\nis the incident light intensity at the surface of the water.\nIo\nIo\nA.\nB.\nln(I)\n20 m\n20 m\nln(I)\nTemperature\nTemperature\nDepth\nDepth\n100 m\n100 m\na) Which marine site would have the most net primary productivity and why?\nA will have the most NPP. In A, since light penetrates below the mixing depth,\nphytoplankton will be actively photosynthesizing throughout the whole mixed layer and\nwill have positive NPP. In B, phytoplankton will spend some of their time below the\ncompensation depth, so they will spend some of their time respiring only, hence their\noverall NPP will be lower. In other words, the GPP/R ratio will be higher in A, meaning\nNPP will be greater.\nb) The next part of the study involves looking at the marsh itself. It is assumed in this\nproblem that the only source of primary productivity in marshes is a marsh grass called\nSpartina. You determine that for a patch of marshland the Gross Primary Productivity\n(GPP) is 400 g C m-2 day-1, the NPP is 325 g C m-2 day-1, and the NCP is 200 g C m-2\nday-1. What is the respiration rate of autotrophs and heterotrophs in this system?\nNPP = GPP - RA\nNCP = NPP - RH\n\nName: ____________________ Page 6\nSkylar participates in a survey to determine the food web of the marshland. She draws the\nfollowing food web that includes a turtle, a snail, Spartina, a blue crab, and a striped bass:\n  \n\nc) Assume the exploitation efficiency between all trophic levels is 10%. How many g C\nof Spartina is required to produce 1200 g C of striped bass?\nP = 1200 g C/ (0.1)(0.1)(0.1)\n\nd) Define what a keystone predator is in a sentence or two. Which of the above species is\nthe keystone specie of this system? What would happen to the other species if it were\nremoved?\nA keystone predator is one that has a controlling effect on an ecosystem; its removal\nwould have a larger effect than predicted by numbers alone.\n\nBlue crab, the species is keeping the periwinkle in check. Since there are no other\ncompeting herbivores in this system, periwinkle would eat all the Spartina, habitat would\nbe gone. Striped Bass population would disappear, same with turtles.\n\ne) Skylar does some behavioral observations of striped bass in the system. She finds that\ntheir diet consists of 60% blue crab and 40% of a herbivorous crab. Calculate the striped\nbass' exact trophic level.\nTL = 0.4*2 + 0.6*3\n\nf) List two methods taught in class to determine the mean trophic level of fish.\nGut content analysis, stable isotope analysis\n\ng) Juncus is a species of marsh grass that is found in the high marsh (farther from the\nocean). It is not nearly as nitrogen and water limited as Spartina, but grows slower than\nSpartina. How does Spartina impact Juncus' fundamental niche? Why does Juncus\n\nName: ____________________ Page 7\nsurvive in the high marsh? What would happen to Juncus' area of cover if Spartina were\nremoved from the system?\nSpartina competes with Juncus for physical space. Because Spartina can grow fast, it\ntakes up space quickly. However Juncus does not require as many nutrients and water to\ngrow so its able to survive in the high marsh. If Juncus did not have to compete with\nSpartina it would be able to cover more of the marsh.\n7. (10 points)\nThe size of the human population on Earth has increased dramatically in the past 200\nyears. This has been described as a period of \"demographic transition\". Some countries\nhave already finished going through the transition, while others have not.\na) On the axes below, sketch the changes in birth rate (bx), death rate (dx), and relative\npopulation size (N) over the course of a demographic transition in a population. Indicate\non the time axis of the graph where you might find a country like France, and where you\nmight find a country like Liberia.\nTime\nDeath Rate\nBirth Rate\nPopulation\nLiberia\nRelative\nPopulation\nBirth Rate/\nSize\nDeath Rate\n[# per 1000\nper year]\nFrance\nb) Explain the underlying causes of the features on your figure.\nWhen the birth and death rates are high and similar, the population is fairly stable and\nrelatively small. As agricultural, medicine, and technology (the ability to create/use\nenergy) improve; the death rate is reduced while the birth rate stays constant. This results\nin a population explosion. Decreases in death rates continue and eventually level off.\nBirth rates also decrease, reflecting socioeconomic changes. Eventually the death rate\nsurpasses the birth rate and population begins to contract.\n8. (15 points) Skylar and Jonathan have had enough of the precipitation in New England\nand decide to go to the Kalahari Desert. They stumble across two kinds of scorpions: red\nand black. Skylar and Jonathan decide to study the competition between the two species.\nThey determine that the carrying capacity (K1) of red scorpions is 100 and that the\n\nName: ____________________ Page 8\ncarrying capacity (K2) of black scorpions is 150. Jonathan calculates that the impact of\nthe black scorpion on the red scorpion (α) is 2 and the impact of the red scorpion on the\nblack scorpion (β) is 3.\n\na) The initial population sizes are 25 red scorpions and 50 black scorpions. Graph the\nisoclines for each species and plot the initial population sizes. Predict the short-term\ndynamics of each population. Predict the final outcome of interspecific competition.\n\nThe isoclines define an unstable equilibrium. From the initial densities, the black\nscorpions will increase and the red scorpions will decrease in the short run. Eventually,\nthe red scorpions will be driven to extinction; the black scorpions will be out at their\ncarrying capacity (150).\n\nb) Skylar does her own calculations and determines that Jonathan's calculation of the\ncarrying capacity (K1) of red scorpions is wrong, but that the rest of his calculations are\ncorrect. What are the relationships between carrying capacities needed for red scorpions\nto win in competition? Write your answer in terms of K1, K2, α, and β.\nK2 < K1 β AND K2 α < K1\n\nc) What are the relationships between carrying capacities needed for red scorpions to\ncoexist with black scorpions? Write your answer in terms of K1, K2, α, and β.\nK2 α < K1 AND K2 > K1 β\n\nd) Define the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis.\nThe intermediate disturbance hypothesis states that at moderate levels of disturbance the\nbiodiversity is highest, because one species is not able to totally dominate (as would in\nlow disturbance) nor do all go extinct (as in high disturbance).\n\nStable Equilibrium\nK1\nK2/β\nK2\nK1/α\nUnstable Equilibrium\nN1  \nN2\nStable Equilibrium\nx\n\nName: ____________________ Page 9\ne) Below is the figure from Connell (1978) demonstrating the intermediate disturbance\nhypothesis:\nDiversity\nFrequency of Disturbance\nJonathan and Skylar determine that according to their isoclines, red scorpions win out in\ncompetition. Explain to your TAs how this hypothesis might explain why we see the red\nand black scorpions coexisting in the Kalahari Desert.\nHere, moderate disturbance may allow black scorpions to survive because it perhaps\nreduces' the red scorpion's population often enough.\n9. (5 Points) Name and describe one additional component included in the \"Sterman\nModel\" that is lacking in the Malthusian human population growth model.\nVariable carrying capacity. In the Malthusian Model the carrying capacity is fixed, while\nin Sterman's model technology, use of resources, and waste generated all affect the\ncarrying capacity.\nBONUS (3 points): List the three necessary (but not sufficient) principles of\nsustainability outlined by Prof. Sterman.\nCan't use renewable resources faster than they are regenerated; can't produce wastes\nfaster than they are rendered harmless; can't use nonrenewables over the long haul at all.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.018J / 7.30J Ecology I: The Earth\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The use of genetically modified trees (GM trees) for reforestation, addresses\nthe repercussions of all of these actions.

Not only are the natural cycles, including the water and\ncarbon cycle, thrown off balance, but effects such as the melting of polar\nicecaps may wipe out entire species. Other negative effects include\nchanges in the geographical distribution of vegetation, and increased sea\nlevels. Effects of global warming on the human population include difficulties\nsourcing energy, transportation, food, and water. Because of these effects,\nthere will be a change in health and infrastructure causing potential famine,\nand disease in many parts of the world (Wuebbles, 2001). The poorest parts\nof the world are at most risk of these effects both because of their financial\ndisadvantage and their rapid population increase.

      "content": "1.018/7.30J\nINTRODUCTION TO CHEMOSTAT THEORY\nThe chemostat, independently developed by Monod (1950) and Novick and Szilard (1950), is a\ncontinuous culture device used to describe the growth characteristics of nutrient-limited\nmicroorganisms under steady state conditions.\nConsider a well-mixed vessel containing a culture of microorganisms. Let v be the volume of the\nculture and let N be the cell density. The flow rate, f, is the rate at which fresh medium is pumped\ninto the culture and the rate at which the contents are removed, maintaining a constant volume, v,\nin the vessel. f/v is the dilution rate of the culture, D. All nutrients in the influent medium are in\nexcess except one, the limiting nutrient, which enters at a concentration Si. The concentration of\nthe limiting nutrient in the vessel is S, and the cells have a specific growth rate r.\nThe rate of change of the cell density in the vessel can be written as\ndN\ndt\n= rN - DN\n\n(1)\nwhich is the growth rate of the cells minus the rate at which they are being washed out of the\nculture vessel. In a steady state, equation (1) is equal to zero, thus\n\n(2)\nrN = DN\nand\n\n(3)\nr = D\nThat is, in steady state, the growth rate of the cells will be equal to the dilution rate of the culture.\nr and D have the unit time -1, which is the specific growth rate of the cells (you can think of it as\ncells per cell per day.)\nThe rate of change of the concentration of the limiting nutrient in the vessel can be written\ndS/dt = DSi - DS - rNQ\n(4)\nwhere Q is the cell quota, or the amount of limiting nutrient per cell. In steady state, equation (4)\nequals zero, and\n\nD(Si - S) = rNQ\n(5)\nwhich, since D = r, reduces to\nN = (Si - S) /Q\n(6)\nThus, cell density in the culture is a function of the cell quota and the concentration of the limiting\nnutrient in the culture vessel.\n\nS.W. Chisholm\n\nMonod (1950) showed that the growth of bacteria limited by a single substrate can be described\nby the equation\nr = rmax S/ (Ks + S)\n(7)\nwhere rmax is the maximum possible growth rate of a species and Ks is the substrate\nconcentration at rmax/2. Since D = r, equation (7) can be rewritten as\nS = Ks D/ (rmax - D)\n(8)\nCombining equations (6) and (8) yields\nN = [Si - Ks D/rmax - D] / Q\n(9)\nThus, in a system where Q is a constant, if Ks, rmax, and Q are known for a given species,\nsteady state values of N and S can be predicted for any dilution rate using equations (8) and (9).\nr = hr-1\nspecific growth rate of cells\nN = cells ml-1\ncell density\nSi, S = g ml-1\ninfluent, effluent dissolved concentration of limiting nutrient\nQ = g cell-1\ncell quota - amount of limiting nutrient in the cell\nY = 1/Q cells g-1\nyield coefficient\nD = day-1 = f/v\ndilution rate\nf = ml day-1\nflow rate\nV = ml\nvolume of culture\nNovick, A, and L.

      "content": "1.018 - 7.30J\nHandout:\nAdapted from:\nLECTURES IN BIOLOGY\nS.E. Luria, 1975\n(MIT Professor, Nobel Laureate 1969)\n[Note: This account of photosynthesis is over 35\nyears old. Certainly, much more is known about the\nstructure of the photosynthetic apparatus and its\nunderlying biophysics than is portrayed here. But\nthis account summarizes the important features in a\nsimple and elegant way. Luria was a master at doing\nthis, and it has stood the test of time. P.C.]\nPhotosynthesis is a remarkable process, which green\nplants, algae, and some bacteria use to convert the\ncarbon of CO2 to organic matter. Photosynthesis\noperates by fixing CO2 through a cycle of reactions\ncalled the Calvin cycle after an American biochemist\n(no relation of the 16th century Protestant reformer).\nThis cycle has many instructive features.\n!\n12 ATP\n12 NADPH\n3 iP\nglucose 6-P\n2 iP\n6 ADP\n12 ADP\n12 NADP +\n12 iP\n12 H+\n6 CO 2\n! 6 ATP\nEach circlet means one or more carbon compounds\n(Figure represents 6 runnings of the cycle)\nThe cycle takes in six molecules of CO2 one at a time\nand through a series of steps converts them into one\nmolecule of glucose. The important points are:\n(1) Carbon enters only as CO2 and exits only as\nsugar.\n(2) To convert 6 moles of CO2 to one mole of sugar\nC6H12O6 the cycle uses 18 moles of ATP, converting it\nto ADP and Pi. This makes sense: when a cell burns\nsugar to form CO2 in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, it\nreleases energy and stores some of it in the form of\nATP. So, to make sugar from CO2, there is need to\nuse some ATP.\nOVERVIEW OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS\n(3) Just as glycolysis and the Krebs cycle release\nelectrons to NAD\n+, the reverse process of making\nsugar from CO2 requires electrons. In other words, to\nreduce CO2 to sugar one needs a source of reducing\npower. The cycle provides it in the form of NADPH\n(the relative of NADH). Twelve moles of NADPH are\nneeded for every mole of sugar made; therefore the\nentire reaction should be written\n6CO2 + 12H2O + 18ATP + 12NADPH + 12 H\n+ →\nglucose-6-P + 6O2 + 18ADP + 12NADP\n+ + 17Pi +\n6H2O\nNADPH is not a specialty of photosynthesis: it is used\nby most cells as the favorite electron donor for\nbiosynthetic purposes.\n[The Calvin cycle is used not only for photosynthesis\nbut for all organisms that must make their organic\ncarbon from carbon dioxide. Some important groups\nof bacteria, for example, oxidize H2, or H2S, or S, or\neven CO (the exhaust gas) and use the electrons\nfrom these compounds to get NADH or NADPH and\nto store energy as ATP made through an electron\ntransport system. They use CO2 for carbon source,\nfixing it by the Calvin cycle. This, however,\ncontributes very little to the overall CO2 fixation on\nearth.]\nNote that in the equation of photosynthesis I have\nthrown in H2O and O2 and have left out light. The\nCalvin cycle constitutes the so-called dark reaction of\nphotosynthesis. What does light do? It provides the\nenergy needed to make ATP and NADPH by the\nlight-reaction part of the process.\nIn plant cells this takes place in a complex apparatus\ncalled chloroplast.\nChloroplasts contain pigments that absorb specific\nwavelengths of light and convert it into chemical\nenergy.\nchloroplast\nthylakoid disks\ngrana\n\nPlants are green because the chloroplast pigments,\nchlorophyll and carotenoids, absorb the red light. In\nthe chloroplasts the molecules of chlorophyll and\ncarotenoid are present in membrane sacs, called\nthylakoids, which are stacked in the so-called grana.\nThe arrangement is such that the excitations\nproduced in the pigment molecules by the quanta of\nlight are transferred to a special group of chlorophyll\nmolecules (pigment system I or PSI) which act like a\ncondenser accumulating excitation energy. Then\nelectrons are pulled out and transferred to molecules\nof ferredoxin: a small protein that is literally loaded\nwith iron atoms. The iron atoms of ferredoxin that\nreceive electrons from chlorophyll are then in the\nreduced Fe\n+ + state and are powerful donors of\nelectrons.\nferredoxin\nNADPH +\nP 700\nPigment\nsystem II\nlight\n2hν\nPigment\nSystem I\nlight\n2hν\neither\nor\nNADP +\n2 H+\nO\nZ\nADP\nATP\nADP\nATP\n2e -\n2e -\n2e -\n2e -\n2e -\n2e -\nQ\n(1/2 O 2)\nH2O\nThese electrons can then be used in a variety of\nways. Some are returned to chlorophyll through a\nseries of reactions that produce a substantial amount\nof ATP. Other electrons from reduced ferredoxin are\nside-tracked to produce NADPH.\nAt this point we may have generated all the ATP and\nNADPH we need to fix CO2 to form sugar in the\nCalvin cycle. Naively, we might believe that\neverything is settled. But once more the first law of\nLuria raises its ugly head. When electrons are taken\nfrom reduced ferredoxin to make NADPH, they\ncannot be returned to chlorophyll. To regenerate\nchlorophyll we need a replenishing trick. In plant\ncells, the trick is to use a second set of pigment\nmolecules, PSII, which when excited by light also\nrelease electrons like PSI. These electrons are\ntransferred to the chlorophyll molecules of PSI. But\nthe difference is that the chlorophyll molecules of\nPSII can regain their electrons from water, releasing\noxygen:\n2 H2O → O2 + 4 H\n+ + 4 e\n-\nThis is why plant photosynthesis generates O2.\nThis reaction is the source of all the oxygen in the\natmosphere. The cells are happy, having balanced\ntheir equation, and we can take a deep breath. (Note\nthat H2O cannot provide electrons directly to PSI.)\nExperiments with H2\n18O have shown that all oxygen\natoms come from water, not from CO2. The action\nspectrum, that is, the relative efficiency of various\nwavelengths, for plant photosynthesis looks like this:\nrelative\nefficiency\nbacteria\n680 nm\nplants\nwavelength\nThere are two absorption maxima, one in the red at\nabout 680 nm, the other in the blue at about 450\nnm. The red maximum is also the one that is efficient\nfor photosynthesis. Chlorophyll, a green substance,\nhas a porphyrin ring similar to the ones present in the\nheme of the cytochromes, which are yellow to red.\nPlants are not the only organisms that carry out\nphotosynthesis: some bacteria do it too, but they do\nnot generate O2 because they take electrons from\nsubstances like H2S or organic compounds rather\nthan from water.\nSince photosynthetic bacteria do not produce\noxygen, their photosynthesis is inhibited by air. If\nyou look at a pond in the summer, you find green\nalgae spread on the surface of the water. The\nphotosynthetic bacteria locate themselves below the\nalgae, where there is little oxygen left. The light that\nreaches them has passed through a layer of algae,\nbut they can still use it. The bacterial pigments prefer\nthe longer wavelengths of light, which are not\nabsorbed by algae.\nHow efficient is photosynthesis? In most plants 1 to\n3 percent of the energy absorbed as light is\nconverted into sugar. In sugar cane the yield can be\nas high as 8 percent: this is why sugar cane is such a\nfantastically good crop.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.018J / 7.30J Ecology I: The Earth\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Redox Chemistry Review\nI. Oxidation State or Number\nThe oxidation state or number of a compound gives a relative measure of how oxidized\n(electron-poor) or reduced (electron-rich) a compound is. The number is relative because it\nis only meaningful when compared to the number for another compound, to determine which\none is more oxidized or more reduced.\nRules for calculating the oxidation state of an element in a molecule (from Brock, Biology of\nMicroorganisms, 11th Ed. Appendix A-1).\n1. The oxidation state of an element in an elementary substance (e.g., H2, O2) is zero.\n2. The oxidation state of the ion of an element is equal to its charge (e.g., Na+ = +1, O2- = -2).\n3. The sum of the oxidation numbers of all atoms in a neutral molecule is zero. Thus, H2O is neutral\nbecause it has two H at +1 each and one O at -2.\n4. In an ion, the sum of the oxidation numbers of all atoms is equal to the charge on that ion. Thus,\nin the OH- ion, O(-2) + H(+1) = -1\n5. In compounds, the oxidation state of O is virtually always -2, and that of H is +1 (this gets more\ncomplicated in some organic compounds).\n6. In simple carbon compounds, the oxidation state of C can be calculated by adding up the H and O\natoms present and using the oxidation states of these elements as given in #5, because in a\nneutral compound, the sum of the oxidation numbers must be 0. Thus, the oxidation state of\ncarbon in methane, CH4, is -4 (4 H at +1 = +4).\n7. In organic compounds with more than one C atom, it may not be possible to assign a specific\noxidation number to each C atom, but it is still useful to calculate the oxidation state of the\ncompound as a whole. Thus, the oxidation state of carbon in glucose, C6H12O6, is zero and the\noxidation state of carbon in ethanol, C2H6O, is -2.\ni. Calculate the oxidation state of each element in the following compounds (answers at end).\nA. sulfate - SO4\n2-\nS: __________\nB. hydrogen sulfide - H2S\nS: __________\nC. ammonia - NH3\nN: __________\nD. nitrite - NO2\n-\nN: __________\nE. nitrate - NO3\n-\nN: __________\nF. CO2\nC: __________\nG. iron hydroxide - Fe(OH)3 Fe: __________\nII. Reduction and oxidation reactions\nThe oxidation states you just calculated above provide information about how reduced\n(electron-rich) or oxidized (electron-poor) each element in a compound is. The smaller (more\nnegative) the oxidation state, the more reduced a compound is; conversely, larger (more\npositive) oxidation states are associated with more oxidized compounds. Hence, Fe3+\n(oxidation state +3) is more oxidized than elemental Fe (oxidation state 0).\n\nReduction and oxidation reactions (together known as redox) involve the transfer of electrons\n(e-) from one molecule to another. Since free electrons cannot exist in solution, these\nreactions are always coupled. Generally, electrons are transferred from more reduced\ncompounds to more oxidized compounds, since the reduced compounds are more electron\nrich than oxidized compounds. The process of losing electrons is called oxidation and the\nprocess of gaining electrons is called reduction.\nA helpful mnemonic: \"LEO the lion says GER.\" (Loss of Electrons is Oxidation;\nGain of Electrons is Reduction).\nIn a redox reaction, the oxidizing agent is the reactant that gains electrons and is therefore\nreduced through the reaction (causing the other compound to become more oxidized).\nConversely, the reducing agent is the compound that loses electrons through the reaction\nand therefore is oxidized through the reaction (causing the other compound to become more\nreduced).\nThere are different ways of writing redox reactions. Let's use the example of acetaldehyde\n(CH3CHO) getting reduced to ethanol (CH3CH2OH), a process that happens in respiration,\nusing NADH as the electron source. NADH is common biological molecule that is frequently\nthe source of reducing power. In its oxidized form, NAD+, it is a common electron acceptor.\n1. Sum of two half reactions:\nacetaldehyde + 2 H+ + 2 e- ethanol\nNADH NAD+ + H+ + 2 e\n\nacetaldehyde + H+ + NADH ethanol + NAD+\n2. Electron-transfer diagram:\nacetaldehyde\nNAD+\nethanol\nNADH\n3. Overall reaction (doesn't show electrons):\nacetaldehyde + H+ + NADH ethanol + NAD+\nii. Fill in the blanks.\nA. Through this redox reaction, ________________ is oxidized to ________________.\nB. ________________ is reduced to ________________.\nC. ________________ is the oxidizing agent and ________________ is the reducing agent.\n2 e-\n\nD. ________________ and ________________ are the oxidized forms.\nE. ________________ and ________________ are the reduced forms.\nGiven an overall reaction, how do we know which reactant is the oxidizing agent and\nwhich one is the reducing agent?\nFor simple compounds, we can use the oxidation states with the general rules in Part I.\ne.g. H2S + 4 H2O + 8 Fe3+ 8 Fe2+ + 10 H+ + SO4\nQuestion: Is the S or the Fe getting reduced or oxidized?\nOxidation number of S:\nH2S = -2,\nSO4\n2- = +6\nOxidation number of Fe:\nFe3+ = +3,\nFe2+ = +2\nSince the oxidation number for S increases, the sulfur is getting oxidized.\nSince the oxidation number for Fe decreases, the iron is getting reduced.\nIn an electron-transfer diagram, we would draw this reaction this way:\nFe3+\nSO4\n2-\ne -\nFe2+\nH2S\nHowever, it is not always this easy to determine the oxidizing and reducing agents.\nFortunately, there are tables showing the half-reactions for many common reduction\nreactions, such as the one at the end of this handout. Let's use the following reaction from\nthe citric acid cycle (FADH2 is a compound similar to NADH):\nsuccinate + FAD fumarate + FADH2\nFrom Table 1, we can obtain the following 2 half-reactions (don't worry about E0\n′ (V) yet):\n(1)\nfumarate + 2 H+ + 2 e- succinate\n(2)\nFAD + 2 H+ + 2 e- FADH2\nWe have to reverse equation (2) to get the reactant on the correct side. If the number of\nelectrons is not the same in both reactions, multiply one or both reactions by the appropriate\nnumber so that the e- will cancel when the two equations are added together. Remember,\noverall equations don't show e-.\n\n___________\n___________\n___________\n___________\nsuccinate fumarate + 2 H+ + 2 e-\nFAD + 2 H+ + 2 e- FADH2\n\nsuccinate + FAD fumarate + FADH2\niii. Fill in the blanks.\nA.\n2 e-\nB. ________________ is the oxidizing agent.\nC. ________________ is the reducing agent.\nIII. Redox reactions and thermodynamics\nWill the reaction of succinate and FAD occur spontaneously (exothermic reaction) or will it\nrequire energy input (endothermic reaction)? We can use thermodynamics to answer this\nquestion. Different molecules have different tendencies to donate or accept e-. The\ncompounds in Table 1 are ranked according to their tendency to be in the oxidized form (on\nthe left) or in the reduced form (on the right). Generally speaking, the more reduced a\nmolecule is, the more potential energy it contains that can be released for biological work.\nTable 1 contains values for E0\n′ , which is reduction potential. Reduction potential is a\nmeasure of how likely the reduction (forward) reaction is to occur. When comparing two\nreactions, the one with a higher reduction potential (more positive, i.e., higher in the table) is\nmore likely to occur in the forward direction. Essentially, electrons will move up the table,\nflowing from the reduced compound in the reaction with the lower reduction potential to the\noxidized compound in the reaction with the higher reduction potential.\nTake any two equations. The reactant on the left side of the higher equation will be the\noxidizing agent, and accept electrons from the product of the lower equation, which will be\nthe reducing agent (by donating electrons). Generally, oxidized compounds higher in the\nchart are stronger oxidizing agents than the oxidized compounds lower in the chart.\nConversely, the reduced compounds lower in the chart are stronger reducing agents than\nthose higher in the chart.\nLet's take an example:\nE0\n′ (V)\n(1)\n1⁄2 O2 + 2 H+ + 2 e- H2O\n+0.816\n(2)\nNO2\n- + 8 H+ + 6 e- NH4\n+ + 2 H2O\n+0.34\n\nO2\ne -\nH2O\n′\nIn this system, since the E0 value is greater for reaction (1), reaction (1) will proceed forwards\nand reaction (2) will proceed backwards. In other words, O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent than\nNO2\n-, so NH4\n+ will be oxidized to NO2\n-, and O2 will be reduced to H2O.\nNO2\nreleases energy\nNH4\n+\nThis reaction will occur spontaneously and release energy because it is thermodynamically\nfavorable. The measure of this is ΔG0'\n, or the Gibbs free energy.\nWhen ΔG0' < 0, energy is released and reactions proceed without added energy. (Think of\nsledding down a hill).\nWhen ΔG0' > 0, energy is required to make a reaction proceed. (Think of pushing a sled\nuphill).\nIt is possible for NO2\n- to oxidize H2O to O2, but this would require additional energy.\nReduction potential values can be used to calculate ΔG0' according to the Nernst Equation:\nΔG0' = -nF (ΔE0\n')\nn\n= number of e- transferred\nF\n= Faraday constant (23 kcal V-1 mol-1)\nΔE0\n'\n= E0\n'(oxidizing agent) - E0\n'(reducing agent)\nΔE0\n' and ΔG0' have opposite signs, so when ΔE0\n' > 0, then ΔG0' will be negative.\nUsing NH4\n+/O2 example, let's calculate ΔE0\n' and ΔG0' .\n'\n3/2 O2 + 6 H+ + 6 e- 3 H2O\nE0 = +0.816 V *\nNH4\n+ + 2 H2O NO2\n- + 8 H+ + 6 e-\nE0\n' = -0.34 V **\n\nNH4\n+ + 3/2 O2 NO2\n- + 2 H+ + H2O\nΔE0\n' = +0.476 V\nΔG0' = -(6)*(23 kcal V-1 mol-1)*(0.476 V) = -65.688 kcal/mol\n*\n'\nNote:\nMultiplying by a constant to get the right number of e- doesn't change ΔE0.\n**\n'\nWhen we reversed reaction (2), we had to change the sign on ΔE0.\n\niv. Going back to the succinate and FAD example, calculate ΔE0\n' and ΔG0' . Will this reaction\noccur spontaneously?\nv. For an overall reaction with CO2 and H2S as reactants and H2O, S and 1 mole of glucose\nas products, calculate ΔE0\n' and ΔG0'. Will this reaction occur spontaneously?\nFinal notes:\nThis is highly over-simplified. For a more complete description, please consult a thermo\ndynamics or chemistry book.\nAll of these reactions are affected by pH and concentrations of products and reactants.\nFurthermore, some products or reactants can be further stabilized by other chemical\nreactions (e.g., Fe3+ can precipitate as Fe(OH)3), which also alter the equilibrium.\nThermodynamics describes a world at steady state, but our world is not at thermodynamic\nequilibrium. Kinetics, or the rates of reactions, also determines whether a reaction will occur\nor not. Thermodynamics would predict the oxidation of all carbon on earth to CO2, since O2 is\nsuch a strong oxidant (notice its place in Table 1). However, conversion of solar energy into\nreduced carbon compounds by autotrophs leads to higher energy configurations and means\nthat thermodynamically unstable configurations (such as our bodies) can occur.\n\n-\n-\nTable 1.

Industrial ecology takes the pattern and\nprocesses of natural ecosystems as a design for sustainability. It represents a shift in paradigm from conquering\nnature to becoming nature.\nEcological Engineering: Unlike industrial ecology, the focus of Ecological Engineering is on the manipulation of\nnatural ecosystems by humans for our purposes, using small amounts of supplemental energy to control systems\nin which the main energy drives are still coming from non-human sources. It is the design of new ecosystems for\nhuman purposes, using the self-organizing principles of natural ecosystems.\n[Note: The popular definition of ecological engineering is \"the design of human society with its natural environment\nfor the benefit of both.\". What is the logical flaw in this definition?]\nEcological Economics: Integrating ecology and economics in such a way that economic and environmental\npolicies are reinforcing rather than mutually destructive.\nUrban ecology: For ecologists, urban ecology is the study of ecology in urban areas, specifically the relationships,\ninteractions, types and numbers of species found in urban habitats. Also, the design of sustainable cities, urban\ndesign programs that incorporate political, infrastructure and economic considerations.\nConservartion Biology: The application of diverse fields and disciplines to the conservation of biological diversity.\nRestoration Biology: Appllication of ecosystem ecology to the restoration of deteriorated landscapes in an\nattempt to bring it back to its original state as much as possible. Example, prarie grass.\n\nLandscape Ecology: \"Landscape ecology is concerned with spatial patterns in the landscape and how they\ndevelop, with an emphasis on the role of disturbance, including human impacts\" (Smith and Smith). It is a\nrelatively new branch of ecology, that employs Global Information Systems. The goal is to predict the responses\nof different organisms to changes in landscape, to ultimately facilitate ecosystem management.\n* * *\nAll these disciplines require an understanding of the \"organizing principles\" of ecosystems, i.e., their ecology. This\ninvolves the detailed study of the structure and function of ecosystems in their undisturbed state, and using their\ndesigns to:\n- determine the resilience of ecosystem functions to human activities.\n- design ecosystems which function in the service of human beings with minimal fossil energy input (ideally\nnone) and minimal waste.\n- design the industrial infrastructure.\n- integrate the value of \"goods and services\" of natural ecosystems into the global economic system.\nWhat is \"Sustainability\"?: There are many definitions of this one, depending on your perspective. Here's\nours: Sustainability is a property of a human society in which ecosystems (including humans) are managed such\nthat the conditions supporting present day life on Earth can continue.\nEcology and The Future of Biology\n\"However it is said, the future of biology lies not in the ongoing reduction of biology to molecular tidbits, but in\nstudying biology in its essence; studying the organism and the environment as primary, not derived entities.\nBoth, however, are facets of a single grand problem, the nature of biological organization. Such an emphasis\nbrings to light an entirely different future for biology, one in which understanding the dynamic of the biosphere\nand the evolution and nature of cellular organization are central issues.\"\nCarl Woese 2006\nLevels of Studying Ecology\nBiosphere: The earth's ecosystem interacting with the physical environment as a whole to maintain a steady\nstate system intermediate in the flow of energy between the high energy input of the sun and the thermal sink\nof space (merges with atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere...).\n↓\nBiome: Large scale areas of similar vegetation and climatic characteristics.\n↓\nEcosystem: Set of organisms and abiotic components connected by the exchange of matter and energy\n(forest, lake, coastal ocean). Or, \"the smallest units that can sustain life in isolation from all but atmospheric\nsurroundings.\"\n↓\nCommunity: Interacting populations which significantly affect each other's distributions and abundance\n(intertidal, hot spring, wetland).\n↓\nPopulation: Group of interacting and interbreeding organisms\n↓\nCell/Organism\n→ Organelle → Molecule → Atom\nPrinciple of Integrative Levels - Emergence\nPrinciple of hierarchical control: As components combine to produce larger functional wholes in hierarchical\n\nseries, new properties emerge. That is, one cannot explain all of the properties at one level from an\nunderstanding of the components at the one below.\n\"Emergence is the feedback between micro- and macro-level behaviors. The local dynamics of a set of interacting\nentities supports an emergent set of global dynamical structures which stabilize themselves by setting the\nboundary conditions within which the local dynamics operates. That is, these global structures can 'reach down' to\ntheir own physical bases of support and fine tune them in the furtherance of their own global ends. Such LOCAL\nto GLOBAL back to LOCAL, inter-level feedback loops are essential to life, and are the key to understanding its\norigin, evolution and diversity.\" [Taylor, CE in Artificial Life II. 1991 Langton, CG, Taylor, C. Farmer. KD, eds. pp.\n371-408 Addison-Wesley].\nGuide to Readings Why we chose them/Why they are important/ What to look for.\nChapter 1 (Smith and Smith): This is an excellent overview of the field of Ecology, what kind of science it is,\nhow it is structured, how ecologists form and test hypotheses, and why it is important.\nRedox Primer: Read in preparation for the next set of lectures and work through examples\nRemmert - Ecology: This is my favorite introduction to an Ecology Textbook. I think it captures the \"essence\"\nof ecology and should be read and understood before starting an Ecology course. Most important is the last\nparagraph. We have to remember that the Earth's ecosystems have not always been hospitable for humans,\nand most likely will not be at some time in the future. We are but just a 'blip' on the evolutionary landscape.\nIt will be a daunting task to sustain the Earth's ecosystems in a way that will sustain human life on earth. Our\nunderstanding of Ecology will have to be a lot better than it is now.\nRowe - Biological Fallacy: Life Equals Organisms: This should get you thinking about what Life is. It's all\nperspective, and it is important for us to get out of our rigid view of life that is primarily dictated by our size\nrelative to other living systems.\nAssume you could \"see\" energy and individual elements, and think about the\nhow you would describe life if: 1) you sat on the inside of a cell and watched the energy and elements flow\nthrough metabolism, and 2) you sat on a space shuttle and watched the energy flow and element cycles of the\nEarth. What would be similar and different?\nVernadski - The Biosphere (1926): Vernadski was a man ahead of his time, with brilliant insights into how the\nEarth works. This was the first account of the Earth as an integrated living system, and preceeded modern\nEcology by decades. You will see that in Vernadski's view of the Earth, life forces shape the abiotic\ncomponents of the Earth's crust.\nStudy Questions\nThese example questions are designed to help you understand and think about lectures and readings. these are a\nguide only. you are not required to hand them in, nor do they necessarily include all of the major concepts covered\nin class and readings.\n-\nGive an example of \"the organism environment interaction being two way\" with regard to how organisms\nchange planetary chemistry and physics.\n-\nWhat is the relationship between ecology and environmentalism?

What does he mean by the following statements?\n-\nThe biosphere is the creation of the Sun\n\n-\nA \"chemical calm\" would overcome the Earth if life ceased to exist\n-\n\"Under the thermodynamic conditions of the biosphere, water is a powerful chemical agent...\" but on a\ndead Earth, water is \"...a compound of weak chemical activity\"?\n...there is no \"original\" state in nature, no nature-in-itself in the sense that a fixed set of characteristics holds true, like the law\nof gravity, always and everywhere. Nature resembles less a law than a story. And the story is not over. Thus to inquire of\nnature is to inquire of time, of circumstance and of contingency.

Typically whether these carbon, energy and electron sources\nare organic, or inorganic, guides the classification. The different types of metabolisms found in\nthese diverse organisms, that differentially oxidize or reduce different organic and inorganic\n\nchemicals in the environment, is what drives biogeochemical cycles in the biosphere. Their\nintegrated activities balance oxidation and reduction reactions in the environment, and keep the\nsystem cycling between the oxidized and reduced forms of organic and inorganic materials.\nA. Autotrophs\nThese \"self-nourishers\" typically get their energy from the sun (photoautotrophs), or from\nreduced inorganic compounds (chemoautotrophs a.k.a. chemolithotrophs). They get their\ncarbon for growth and production of new cells from CO2.\nThe energy generating reactions produces ATP' and NADPH'', which provide stored\nbiochemical energy and reducing power forbiosynthesis and production of new cells. For\noxygen-generating photosynthetic organisms (like plants and cyanobacteria), the light-requiring\nreaction that generates energy is known as the Hill, or \"light reaction\". There are a number of\ndifferent ways that organism can incorporate, or \"fix\" inorganic CO2 into organic material. In\nplants, the Calvin Cycle, is common biochemical pathway, and uses the stored energy and\nreducing power (ATP and NADPH) to convert CO2 to CH2O (sugar).\n1.

(***NADH =\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (chemically similar to NADPH, NADH is oxidized to facilitate\nATP production, while NADPH is associated with biosynthesis).\n1. Aerobic respiration\nWho?

Oxygenic photosynthesis produces (by the splitting of water as a reducing agent)\none of the most powerful oxidants known - oxygen. The biosphere on the contemporary Earth\nruns largely on the carbon produced by CO2 fixation by oxygenic photosynthesis, and on the\nfree energy difference between O2 and organic carbon, which heterotrophs use to fuel their\nmetabolism. The autotrophs synthesize glucose using solar or chemical energy, which is\nbroken down through respiration (either their own or that of the organisms that eat them) to\nprovide the energy necessary for \"biological work\". Redox reactions are central to all of these\nenergy transformations, and the resulting flows of electrons manifest themselves, collectively,\nin the form of global biogeochemical cycles. The activities of bacteria keep these cycles\nmoving. For example, the chemosynthetic bacteria oxidize many essential elements in the\nprocess of getting the energy required to reduce CO2. Certain anaerobic bacteria in turn\nreduce these compounds in the process of anaerobic respiration i.e., they use them as an\nelectron acceptor in the absence of oxygen. This keeps the element cycles cycling\nmaintaining balanced amounts of oxidants and reductants necessary for diverse\nmetabolic processes. This keeps the system from \"running down\" energetically.

      "content": "A proposal for limited implementation of a sunshade\nto evaluate the effects of albedo modification on\nglobal biogeochemical cycles\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n1 December 2009\n\n \nExecutive summary\nClimate change caused by anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other\ngreenhouse gases threatens to negatively impact human lifestyles across the globe through\ndroughts, floods, and rising sea levels. In spite of these concerns, the amount of carbon dioxide\nemitted annually has continued to increase in the past decade, from 6.4 Gt of carbon every year\nin the 1990's to 7.2 Gt in the following decade (Bala, 2009). In addition, a recent study suggests\nthat even if emissions were completely cut, it is too late to prevent temperature and sea level\nrises. In view of these predictions, more direct methods of maintaining the earth's present\nclimate, such as geoengineering, are a possible solution.\nGeoengineering is any attempt to purposefully modify the environment on a large scale.\nHowever, it is likely that in modifying the earth's systems to solve one problem, geoengineering\nschemes would create a host of negative unintended consequences. These consequences,\nwhich might include pollution, precipitation changes, or declining productivity, have the potential\nto be more serious than the climate change caused by global warming. Therefore, it is important\nto thoroughly investigate the side effects of any scheme before implementation. In this paper, I\npropose to study the unintended effects of a geoengineering pitch authored by Roger Angel of\nthe University of Arizona by partially implementing his plan. Angel (2006) proposes to send\nsmall disks into space between the earth and sun to deflect a fraction of the incoming solar\nradiation and thus cool the earth. To study the effects of this sunshade, I propose to install\nabout 10% of the total number of disks. This limited implementation should affect Earth's climate\nno more than a volcanic eruption would; at that scale, scientists would be able to measure small\nchanges in precipitation and net primary productivity and extrapolate their findings to predict the\neffects of a full-scale implementation.\nEven though geoengineering is an extreme option, it may become one day become the\nbest way to negate the harmful climate changes caused by global warming. Experiments such\n\n \nas the one I propose must take place before implementing a geoengineering plan, and thus the\ntime to conduct these experiments is now, before the day of need.\n\n \nIntroduction\nThe causes and consequences of global climate change\nThe elevated levels of CO2 in the atmosphere threaten to dramatically alter global\nclimate. Ordinarily, CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) keep the earth's surface at\nhabitable temperatures. GHGs allow short-wave radiation from the sun to reach the earth's\nsurface, but they readily absorb the long-wave radiation released from Earth's sun-warmed\nsurface. By retaining this thermal energy, GHGs trap heat on the earth's surface, historically\nkeeping enough to raise the average global temperature by 20oC (Smith & Smith, 2001).\nIn recent decades, the burning of fossil fuels, concrete production, and other human\nactivities have released unprecedented amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere (Bala, 2009).\nBefore industrialization, CO2 atmospheric concentrations were 280 ppm. Today, the gas\ncomprises 381 ppm and increases by 2-3 ppm annually (Canadell et al., 2007). Already, the\nheat trapped by GHGs has already caused an average global temperature increase of 0.8oC,\nand climate models predict that is will rise another 1.8-4oC within the century (Bala, 2009).\nThe oceans in particular will be directly affected by global temperature increases. When\nthe ocean temperature rises, the water will expand, possibly raising sea levels by 1-2 m. Melting\nice sheets could raise levels another 1-2 m. As some of the extra CO2 dissolves in the oceans, it\nwill form carbonic acid, bicarbonate, and carbonate, increasing the ocean acidity. Ocean\nacidification negatively impacts marine life for example by preventing calcification in coral reefs\nand interfering with the sense of smell in certain fish (Anthony et al., 2008; Munday et al., 2009).\nAlready, the temperature, level, and acidity of the ocean have risen, while the on-land reserves\nof water in mountain glaciers and snow cover have declined (Bala, 2009). If temperatures\ncontinue to increase, the scale of these consequences grows.\nThe change in climate will destroy homes and livelihoods (Solomon et al., 2009). The\nrising ocean will submerge low coastal plains and small islands. Additionally, a warmer\n\n \natmosphere will contain more water vapor, which will create sweeping, unpredictable\nprecipitation changes (Soloman et al., 2009). Droughts and floods will be more frequent, and\ntropical cyclones more intense (Bala, 2009). Rainfall will decrease by 10-20% in parts of every\ncontinent, which will impoverish water resources, disrupt agriculture, increase desertification,\nand change ecosystems. This level of water shortage is much greater than the one that\ntriggered the Dust Bowl of the 1930's, which was created by a 10% decline in rainfall during little\nmore than a decade. In global warming scenarios, the drought will be both larger and longer\n(Soloman et al., 2009).\nTo preserve the present climate, the world must cut emissions. Yet, despite any political\nmeasures, industries are releasing more GHGs into the atmosphere than ever before. In the\n1990's, human activities released 6.4 Gt of carbon every year, and from 2001-2004, the rate\nincreased to 7.2 Gt C/year (Bala, 2009). At this point, even if CO2 emissions completely cease,\n40% of the human-added carbon will permanently remain in the atmosphere (Solomon et al.,\n2009). As Figure 1 shows, after emissions stop, the global temperature will remain elevated,\ninfluenced by the warmer ocean. The ocean temperature will slowly increase as the water mixes\nwith the warmer atmosphere.\n\nT\nhree\ngra\nphs\nsh\nowi\nng p\nroje\ncted\nCO2\ncon\ncent\nrati\non,\nsurf\nace\nwarm\ning,\nand\noce\nan e\nxpan\nsion\n.\n\nFigure 1: CO2 levels, increased surface temperature, and the rise in sea levels over the next\nthousand years. The change in sea level accounts only for thermal expansion, not for ice melt.\nThe different lines represent different levels of CO2 when emissions stopped, including 450,\n550, 650, 750, 850, and 1200 ppm. In this time scale, the temperature and sea level increases\nappear permanent. (Soloman, Plattner, et al., 2009)\nThe persistence of CO2 levels suggests that no cut in emissions will be enough to\ncompletely alleviate climate change. Clearly, there is a need for more direct and dramatic action\nto counter the effects of global warming.\n\n \nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n \nGeoengineering: a more dramatic action\nAny attempt to negate global warming by deliberately modifying the earth's temperat\nwould be classified as geoengineering. The term designates any modification of the\nenvironment that is both intended and extensive (Keith, 2000). Although today the term\noverwhelmingly refers to proposals to combat anthropogenic warming, the aims can be mor\ndiverse.\nFor decades, geoengineering was not taken seriously. Then in 2006, Paul Crutzen, a\nNobel Laureate in chemistry, published a paper advocating injecting sulfur into the stratosph\nHe was frustrated by failed attempts to curb emissions, and he proposed geoengineering as\nbest option. Well respected for having discovered ozone depletion, Crutzen gave more\nlegitimacy to the entire geoengineering field (Schneider, 2008).\nCurrent geoengineering schemes can be divided into two categories: carbon\nsequestration and solar shading (Bala, 2009). Figure 2 gives a pictorial summary of many of\nthese proposals.\nure\ne\n\nere.\nthe\n\nFigure 2: An illustration of many geoengineering proposals. Carbon sequestration removes\ncarbon from the atmosphere and stores it elsewhere. Iron fertilization, planting new trees, and\ngeologic sequestration are examples of carbon sequestration. Albedo modification schemes\nincrease the amount of solar radiation reflected into space, which here is the purpose of the\nvarious reflectors and cloud seeding. (Bala, 2009)\nIn carbon sequestration, carbon is removed from the atmosphere and stored in\norganisms, deep in the ocean, in minerals, or in geological deposits of oil (Bala, 2009). One way\nto sequester carbon is iron fertilization, or adding iron to the oceans (Keith, 2000). In much of\nthe ocean, iron is the limiting nutrient, so adding iron will cause prodigious phytoplankton\ngrowth. The elemental ratio of carbon to iron in ocean debris is 10,000:1, so for every mole of\niron added to the ocean, biological organisms will consume 10,000 moles of carbon. When\nthese organisms die, they will sink and sequester that carbon deep in the ocean. Like all the\nschemes, iron fertilization has its drawbacks. As the phytoplankton sequester carbon, they also\ntake in large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous and depleting ocean fertility. Furthermore,\n \nwhen the phytoplankton die, detritivores consume them, in the process depleting oceanic\nDiagram dep\nicting m\nany geoengineering p\nroposals to\nreduce gl\nobal warming, includi\nng carbon\nsequestration.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n \ndissolved oxygen levels. Finally, iron fertilization sequesters carbon by disturbing marine\necosystems, which could hurt every level of marine life (Strong et al., 2009). Another proposal\nto permanently sequester carbon is to bind it to magnesium and calcium silicates. Because\ncarbon binds in a 1:1 ratio, however, proposals to use these substances to isolate carbon are\nprohibitively expensive (Keith, 2000).\nThe second major way to actively lower global temperature is to increase the earth's\nalbedo, or reflectivity. The idea is to reflect some fraction of solar radiation away from earth,\nthus counteracting the extra heat trapped by GHGs. There are numerous proposed\nmechanisms, as Bala (2009) explains. One way is to put sulfur, dust, or highly reflective\nparticles into the stratosphere. Another is to coat portions of the ocean with reflective particles,\nand another is to increase cloud cover by releasing H2SO4 over the ocean to act as cloud\ncondensation nuclei. A final way is to put either one large or many small sunshades into space\nto directly block some sunlight from reaching earth\nAlbedo modification proposals have several drawbacks. Many cause pollution by adding\nforeign particles to the atmosphere and the oceans, and they do nothing to address ocean\nacidification (Bala, 2009). In addition, even though they maintain a global temperature, they still\nchange the global hydrological cycle and likely decrease global precipitation (Lunt et al., 2008).\nThe albedo modification schemes are quite intricate, and it is not immediately apparent\nwhether their benefits would outweigh their side effects. Therefore, it is worth investigating one\nof them in greater detail.\nAlbedo modification through a cloud of small spacecraft\nIn his paper, Angel (2006) proposes to send small spacecraft, or flyers, to form a cloud\nin space that will deflect solar radiation. The cloud will decrease the incoming solar flux by 1.8%,\nenough to negate the temperature increase caused by doubled CO2 concentrations. Rockets will\n\n \ntake the pre-assembled flyers to the L1 Lagrange point, a place between the earth and sun\nwhere the gravity forces from each body exactly cancel (Seifritz, 1989).\nThe L1 Lagrange point is a saddle point, meaning that the flyers will drift away without\nactive stabilization. Angel (2006) describes two strategies to keep the flyers in place. First,\nscientists will minimize the radiation pressure on the flyers. Radiation pressure is the pressure\nthat electromagnetic radiation exerts on any object it encounters. This pressure is twice as\nstrong on objects that reflect the radiation compared to those that absorb it. To minimize\nradiation pressure, the flyers will deflect the solar radiation's path by a few degrees instead of\nreflecting it back towards the sun. The spacecraft are far enough away that even this small\nchange in path will cause the radiation to shoot wide of the earth, continuing farther into space.\nTo further secure the sunshade, scientists will place on every flyer a radio receiver and sensors\nto detect position, velocity, and sunlight. The receiver will communicate with larger spacecraft\nthat will be interspersed throughout the cloud, which will in turn relay information to Earth.\nBased on instructions from Earth, these spacecraft will direct the flyers how to move. The flyers\nwill harness radiation pressure to propel movement, using mirrors to channel the distributed\nforce and create the desired velocity.\nEach flyer will be made of an extremely light, transparent film pierced with many holes.\nThe light that passes through the film will be delayed by half a period relative to the light that\npasses through the holes, so they will destructively interfere with each other. The film will have\nvarying levels of thickness, each width retarding a different wavelength of light, and thus\ncreating maximum interference. Figure 3 illustrates the flyers' material.\n\n \nFigure 3: A close-up of the flyer material. (a) T\n \nhe flyers are made of a thin film pierced with\nholes. (b) The different levels of thickness impede light of different wavelengths, thus creating\ninterference with a wide spectrum of the light that passes through the holes. (Angel, 2006)\nAs with any wave, when light passes through a slit, it ripples out the other side in every\ndirection, as Figure 4 illustrates. The spacing of the holes in the flyer will determine how the light\nthat passes through the different holes will interfere, and therefore the hole spacing will\ndetermine the overall angle of deflection of the light through the sun shade.\n \n \nFigure 4: Light moving through a slit. When light passes through a slit, it ripples outward in\nsemi-circles on the other side. The numbers along the line mark the distance away from the slit.\nThe dashed lines mark places of interference between the ripples. The distance between the\ntwo slits determines the angle of these lines of interference, and thus the angle of deflection of\nthe light that will pass through the sunshade disks. (Bawendi, 2008)\nIn\nte\nrf\ner\nen\nce\np\na\ntt\nern of ligh\nt wavelengths passing through a double slit.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\n \nIn total, the cloud will be 100,000 km long, about 15 times the size of the radius of the\nearth. The length is needed to continuously shade the earth throughout all the irregularities of\nthe planet's orbit, which are caused by the pull of the moon.\nAngel (2006) estimates that it will cost several trillion dollars over 25 years to implement\nthe flyers, or about 0.5% of the world's GDP over that time. This cost is significantly lower than\nsimilar proposals in the 1980's, which would have cost 6% of the world's GDP (Bala, 2009).\nThe strength of the plan is that it will take place in space, where the variables are few\nand the physics is well understood. Angel (2006) predicts that the flyers will affect only the solar\nconstant. They will not pollute the earth, and if they are ever unwanted, scientists can direct\nthem away from the L1 Lagrange point. The scheme is robust precisely because it minimizes\nchances for error. The greatest technological hurdle is to install and maintain the flyers, but if\nsuccessfully positioned, they will cool the earth. Whether they will also produce unintended and\nundesirable changes on the earth's surface, however, is a question that warrants further study.\n\n \nExperiment proposal\nUnintended effects of a sunshade in space on global cycles\nThe aim of a sunshade such as the one proposed by Angel (2006) is to preserve current\nlifestyles by maintaining the earth's current temperature. It would be naive, however, to assume\nthat humans could adjust two fundamental engines of earth processes, the thermal heat\nretention and the solar constant, without altering a host of other global biogeochemical cycles,\nincluding temperature distribution, net primary productivity, and the hydrological cycle. The\nsections below will, in layers of building complexity, describe relevant ecological processes.\nThey will then relay the effects that computer modeling predicts a sunshade would have on\nthese processes in a world with double the current amount of CO2.\nLayer 1: Global temperature\nA sunshade endeavors to reduce incoming solar radiation in order to counteract the\nexcess long wave radiation trapped by greenhouse gases, as Figure 5 illustrates. There are\nmarked differences, however, in the way solar radiation and long wave radiation heat the earth.\nSolar radiation reaches the earth only during the day, varies in intensity with latitude, and\nchanges in distribution with the seasons. Greenhouse gases such as CO2, by contrast, are more\nevenly spread over the earth's surface, continually present, and vary less directly with seasons.\nAs a consequence, we would expect the amplitude of the daily, seasonal, and latitudinal\ntemperature variations to decrease in a world increasingly heated by CO2 (Govindasamy &\nCaldeira, 2000).\n\nFigure 5: The balance between incoming and outgoing energy. Greenhouse gases reduce the\nearth-emitted energy, increasing the earth's temperature. To negate this effect, a sunshade\nwould deflect some of the solar incident energy, increasing the solar reflected energy. (NOAA)\n\nThe simulation by Govindasamy and Caldeira (2000) shows a surprisingly small\ndecrease in these cycle amplitudes. In their results, the amplitude of the diurnal cycle\ndecreased by only 0.1oC, and only 15% of the earth experienced significant temperature\nchanges relative to today's average. The effects were greatest near the equator, where the sun\nshines most directly and its decrease would be most felt. Seasonal cycles actually heightened\nrelative to a CO2-rich earth because increased sea ice insulated the winter atmosphere from the\nwarming effects of the ocean.\nTemperature changes are undesirable, but the next unintended effect I will consider,\nplant productivity, has an even more direct impact on human lifestyles.\nLayer 2: Terrestrial biosphere\nNet primary productivity (NPP) in an ecosystem depends partly on the concentration of\n \nCO2 and the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), or radiation between 400-700\n\nnm (Naik et al., 2003). A sunshade's ability to maintain current NPP is initially unclear.\nGeoengineering would be implemented in a world with increased CO2, and thus increased NPP,\nbut the shade itself would decrease PAR, and thus decrease NPP (Govindasamy et al., 2002).\nBoth the simulation by Naik et al. (2003) and Govindasamy et al. (2002) agree that\ncompared to the 60-70% increase in NPP in a doubled-CO2 atmosphere, reduced sunlight\nwould have a negligible effect. Naik et al. (2003) did find, however, that the distribution of NPP\nshifts. In the geoengineered world, tropical forests decrease productivity by 2%, while mid-\nlatitude forests and grasslands increase by 2%.\nThe final ecological processes I will consider, those relating to the global hydrological\ncycle, are extremely complex and will further impact local productivity.\nLayer 3: Global hydrological cycle\nI will explore two aspects of the global hydrological cycle: the concentration of water\nvapor and worldwide precipitation. Temperature and pressure determine the atmospheric\nconcentration of water, so if geoengineering maintains global temperature, then the water vapor\nconcentration will remain constant (Bala et al., 2008). By contrast, global precipitation depends\nnot only on temperature, but also the heat source. Changes in CO2 and solar radiation affect the\nratio of incoming and outgoing radiation on in the atmosphere, but the two mechanisms act at\ndifferent atmospheric levels. CO2 mainly heats the troposphere, whereas solar radiation heats\nthe earth's surface (Hansen et al., 1997). Because the sun acts immediately at the surface, a\ngreater fraction of its energy is available to evaporate water when compared to the energy\nretained by CO2. For every degree of temperature change due to alterations of solar radiation,\nprecipitation will change by 2.5%, but for every degree due to anthropogenic CO2, precipitation\nwill change by only 1.5% (Bala et al., 2008). Therefore, even if the two processes are regulated\nso that temperature changes cancel, there will still be a net change in precipitation.\nAlthough the models show a 5% average decrease of global precipitation in the\n \ngeoengineered world, for most individual locals the variations were less dramatic (Lunt et al.,\n\n2008). Only a third of the globe showed precipitation changes greater than 1%, with the most\nchange centered at the tropics (Bala et al., 2008). Even so, the tropics would remain productive,\nbecause a decrease in evaporation would counteract the decrease of precipitation, and the soil\nmoisture would remain constant (Lunt et al., 2008).\nHypothesis\nThe results of computer modeling presented above represent the full extent of human\nunderstanding of the earth system. Granted, the researchers themselves acknowledge the\nshortcomings of the results; the world has many complex feedbacks for which the models do not\naccount. For example, when Govindasamy et al. (2002) calculated how much NPP would\nincrease in a CO2-rich atmosphere, they did not account nitrogen or phosphorous limitations,\nleading to an unusually high figure. Even so, the models rest on a solid scientific foundation,\nand they should be qualitatively correct. Using them as a basis, I predict that the sunshades\nproposed by Angel (2006), in addition to lowering earth's temperature, will have two major\nunintended effects on an elevated-CO2 planet which will start immediately after implementation:\nthey will redistribute global NPP, and they will reduce precipitation. I expand on each below.\nFirst, a sunshade will negligibly affect the global average NPP, but it will significantly\nincrease or decrease NPP in certain ecosystems. More specifically, the tropics will see the\ngreatest drop in NPP, other ecosystems will see an increase, and the average will be stable.\nEven the local variations of NPP will be small compared to the changes that global warming is\npredicted to cause.\nSecond, a sunshade will reduce evaporation, and by consequence, it will lower global\nprecipitation. Again, the tropics will be the most affected ecosystem, seeing the greatest decline\nin precipitation.\nExperiment proposal\n \n\n \nAlthough the computer models are continually being refined, there is a limited amount\nleft to learn from them. To achieve a breakthrough in understanding, I propose to partially\nimplement the sunshade described by Angel (2006). Because the sunshade's positive and\nnegative effects will be on global cycles, a globe-wide experiment is essential. To implement an\nexperiment on this scale is an enormous undertaking, but it is not a blind leap. The effects\npredicted by modeling are mild, especially when compared to the climate changes expected\nfrom global warming. If implemented on a reduced scale as I suggest, the sunshade effects will\nbe observable without being harmful.\nAngel (2006) proposes to send about 20 million tons of small disks to the L1 Lagrange\npoint to deflect solar radiation, as Figures 6 and 7 illustrate. In this partial, experimental\nimplementation, I propose to install a tenth of the total flyers. In that case the solar flux will\ndecrease by about 0.2%, which is comparable to the effect of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption\n(Trenberth & Dai, 2007). As for the mechanics of implementation, the flyers will weigh one gram\neach and will be sent into space in stacks of 800,000, requiring about 2,500,000 launches to\nexecute this experiment. To fully implement in a year, there will be about 7,000 launches per\nday, with an estimated cost of about half a trillion dollars (Angel, 2006).\n\n \n\nFigure 6: The Lagrange points. The sunshade would be at the L1 Lagrange point, which is\npermanently between the earth and sun. (NASA, 2009)\n\nFigure 7: The L1 Lagrange point. The Lagrange point is 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth,\nfive times farther than the moon. (NASA, 2009)\n\n \n\nFor three years following implementation, we will measure that the sunshade is having\nits intended effect by directly measuring solar radiation with satellites (Haigh, 2002). To learn\nabout the unintended effects, we will gather data about global precipitation and runoff in the\nworld's thousand largest rivers. The Mount Pinatubo eruption produced an observable\ndampening of worldwide rainfall and river runoff, and the effects of the sunshade will be similar\nin magnitude and likewise observable (Trenberth & Dai, 2007). We will also use satellites to\nmeasure chlorophyll in the oceans and vegetation greenness on land, which can then be used\nto calculate NPP (Field et al., 1998). Through these measurements, scientists will quantify the\neffect of a sunshade on the hydrological cycle and on productivity.\nSince the experiment involves the entire earth, it is impossible to have a control with\nwhich to compare the results. Therefore, any changes observed while the sunshade is in place\ncould be due to some unknown cause. To prove that the changes are indeed from the\nsunshade, during years four through six after implementation, we will direct the disks to rotate\n90o and allow the sunlight to pass by. If the changes in precipitation, runoff, and productivity\nreverse themselves, then this twice-observed change will be strong evidence that the sunshade\nis the cause. In making these comparisons, we will use the average measurements for each\nthree-year span, which will help to smooth out natural annual variations in precipitation and\nproductivity.\nThe experiment will accurately determine any unintended effects because it will actually\nproduce them on a small scale. In addition, the experiment will provide relevant data for new\natmospheric models, demonstrate the effectiveness of the equipment, and begin to shade the\nearth while doing so.\n\n \n\nConclusions and recommendations\nExpected results\nIf the experiment goes as expected, then the effects will be observable in first the three\nyears after implementation (Matthews & Caldeira, 2007). Satellites in space will directly\nmeasure a reduction in solar flux, verifying that the sunshade is having its intended effect. On\nEarth, just as climate modeling predicts, there will be a noticeable decrease in precipitation and\nrunoff, particularly in the tropics. If there is a decrease in NPP as measured through vegetation\ngreenness, it will likewise be at the tropics, but the magnitude of the change will be much\nsmaller than the change in precipitation. Neither of phenomena will be extreme when compared\nto the effects that global warming is predicted to have (Lunt et al., 2008). In years four through\nsix after implementation, when scientists will direct the disks to again allow all the sunlight to\npass, these effects will immediately reverse, proving that the changes were due to the\nsunshade.\nI estimate that it will take at least five years to create functional sunshade flyers and the\nrockets to install them, another year after that to implement on a limited scale, and a further six\nyears to evaluate the effects. Based on the figures given by Angel (2006), the experiment will\ncost around $500 billion dollars. Because the experiment partially implements the final plan, any\ncost at this stage would be deducted from the cost of a full-scale implementation. In summary,\nat the end of twelve years the partly installed sunshade will have yielded enough information to\ndefinitively evaluate the project's viability.\nContext: comments about geoengineering\nThe foolproof and safe way to combat global warming is to cut emissions; without\nemissions there would be no need for geoengineering. In light of recent trends, however, this\n\n \ncourse of action looks unlikely. Therefore, the world may need to resort to geoengineering even\nthough this option is not ideal. In addition to being expensive, possibly unfeasible, and of\nquestionable efficacy, geoengineering also changes the way the earth has functioned for\nmillions of years. These changes come with unintended consequences whose negative impact\nmay overwhelm any benefits. As of today, there is still time to cut emissions, but if the world\nwaits too long, then that measure alone will not be enough. In that case, geoengineering could\nbecome the only way to prevent or undo devastations such as droughts, floods, and inundation\nof low-lying lands.\nIf geoengineering becomes the only option, the world will need a well-examined plan\nready for implementation. It is a slow process to create the hardware for a scheme, and an even\nlonger process to thoroughly explore the scheme's unintended consequences and to make\nmodifications accordingly. If my proposed experiment does not start until the sunshade is direly\nneeded, then the delay to design and study the flyers will create a minimum of twelve years of\nunnecessary suffering. If the plan does not work or needs extensive modification, then the time\nwill be even longer. These delays in times of stress would create a prime motivation for hasty\nand irrational decisions about a full-scale implementation. To allow for complete objectivity and\nalleviate future hardship, the prototyping and evaluation should start before the sunshade is\nneeded.\nHow to evaluate this experiment\nAssuming that the sunshade successfully controls temperature and that the negative\neffects are reasonably small, then the scheme I tested should be further explored and kept as\nan option in case it is never necessary. If, however, the sunshade profoundly decreases global\nprecipitation and productivity or is otherwise unsuitable, then scientists should look for\nalternative ways to attenuate the effects of global warming. I would recommend looking into\ncarbon sequestration, because if this sunshade hurts the global climate, then most likely any\n\n \nother sunshade will have a similar impact. In fact, many other sunshades would likely do even\nmore harm by introducing pollutants into the atmosphere. Of course, I still cite cutting emissions\nas the best way to combat global warming.\nIn light of the benefits of advanced planning and testing, I recommend immediately\nbeginning work on the flyers and the delivery system in preparation for the limited\nimplementation. The situation is difficult and the road to a solution is long, but through extra\ndiligence today, the world can intelligently and effectively address a future climate crisis.\n\n \nReferences\nAngel, R.

      "content": "Assessing Excess Carbon Emissions and Soil\nToxicity as Unintended Consequences in\nApplying Biochar as a Geoengineering\nScheme\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDecember 1, 2009\n\nExecutive Summary\nIn the years since the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels\nhave steadily risen, causing an associated increase in global warming. In an attempt to\nremedy some of the effects caused by global warming, various geoengineering schemes\nhave been put forth as possible solutions in resolving the global warming problem. A\nlarge portion of these geoengineering solutions are categorized as carbon sequestration\ntechniques, where the geoengineering schemes vary from injecting liquefied carbon\ndioxide into the deep ocean or fertilizing the oceans with iron to stimulate phytoplankton\ngrowth. The focus of this proposal is on carbon sequestration via biochar burial. Biochar\nis a form of carbon produced via pyrolysis, or combustion with no oxygen or very little\noxygen. The pyrolysis process produces a high-density form of carbon, which can be\nused to sequester carbon through underground burial. A practical implementation of\ncarbon sequestration via biochar would be to convert decaying plant matter into biochar,\nrather than to allow natural decay from occurring, which releases carbon contained in\nthe biomass back into the atmosphere.\nHowever, being an extremely new geoengineering method, biochar still needs to\nbe tested for unintended consequences that may surface from its global application as a\ncarbon sequestration technique. Therefore, this proposal identifies and tests for two\nimportant unintended consequences: unintentional carbon emissions from biochar\nproduction via the use of traditional kilns and soil toxicity affecting crop productivity due\nto residual hydrocarbon content contained in biochar.\nIn many parts around the world, farmers produce biochar as a supplemental\nfertilizer by utilizing traditional kilns often constructed of brick or clay. Although these\nkilns are inexpensive and easy to construct, there is no way of containing the gaseous\npyrolysis byproduct (known as syngas). Syngas is rich in carbon emissions, which then\n\nbecomes released into the atmosphere and adds to the existing excess quantities of\ngreenhouse gases already present in the atmosphere. A rigorous experiment needs to\nbe conducted to assess the amount of carbon emissions emitted through biochar\nproduction via traditional kilns in order to establish a recommendation for the most eco\nfriendly method of producing biochar.\nAdditionally, hydrocarbons are produced naturally during the pyrolysis process,\nand are released during combustion in the form of liquid, which is often harvested in\ncommercial pyrolysis machines as fuel. However, hydrocarbons may not be completely\nreleased from the solid char during pyrolysis, and residual hydrocarbon contained in\nbiochar incorporated into the soil may be detrimental to crop productivity. This poses\ngrave implications since a plot with buried biochar may be rendered unsuitable for\ncultivation. Globally, this may cause biochar burial to be an impractical method of carbon\nsequestration, because it is unrealistic to dedicate entire tracts of land around the world\nfor biochar burial only.\nAt the conclusion of our experiments, we expect traditional kilns to be an\nimpractical method of producing biochar due to the excess carbon emissions produced\nduring combustion. Additionally, we would expect biochar containing low levels of\nresidual hydrocarbon to have the least effect on soil toxicity, which can be measured\nthrough crop productivity. Based on these results, we recommend the use of commercial\npyrolysis machines in the production of biochar to reduce pollution and optimize for the\nlowest level of residual hydrocarbon levels in the biochar. By testing for these two\nunintended consequences, we may then begin to explore the options of implementing\nbiochar as a global carbon sequestration technique.\n\nIntroduction to Global Warming, Geoengineering, and the\nUse of Biochar Burial as a Carbon Sequestration Strategy\nGlobal Warming\n\"Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as it is now evident from\nobservations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread\nmelting of snow and ice, and increase in mean sea level.\" The IPCC (Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change) issued this dire warning in their 2007 Summary for\nPolicymakers document (IPCC, 2007, p. 4). The interconnected link between these three\nfactors is especially potent: for the last thirty years, the snow cover has been decreasing,\nwhile the global sea level increased for nearly 70 years, corresponding with a steady rise\nin global temperature since 1910 (Figure 1).\nA correlation between reduction of glacial length and an increase in temperature\nis demonstrated in 169 glaciers around the world, regardless of elevation and continent\n(Oerlemans, 2005). Utilizing TOPEX-Poseidon satellite technology to monitor sea level\nincreases from 1993 through 2003, scientists measured the sea-level increase at 3.1\nmm per year, which increased 50% or more over measurements in the previous\ndecades, which averaged around 1 to 2 mm per year (Cazenave and Nerem, 2004).\nBreaking down the temperature rise further, anthropogenic gases (greenhouse gases\nsuch as carbon dioxide) are shown to be the real long-term culprits of the rise in global\ntemperature, over natural forces such as volcanic aerosols and solar radiation (Figure\n2).\n\nFigure 1. Observed changes from 1961 to 1990 in (a) global mean temperature, (b)\nglobal average sea level, and (c) Northern Hemisphere snow cover. In (a) and (b), we\nsee an increase in global mean temperature and global average sea level, with a\ncorresponding decrease in (c) snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere (IPCC, 2007, p.\n17).\nGrap\nhs s\nhowi\nng o\nbserved changes from 19\n61-1990 in global mean t\nemperature, global average sea\nl\nev\nel\n, an\nd No\nrthe\nrn hemisphere\nsn\now cover.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nFigure 2. This graph breaks down the contributions of (a) El Nino-Southern Oscillation\n(ENSO), (b) Volcanic Aerosols, (c) Solar Irradiance, and (d) Anthropogenic Forcing\n[including greenhouse gases (GHCs), tropospheric aerosols, and land surface and snow\nalbedo components] to monthly mean global temperatures from 1900 to 2000. The right-\nhand vertical axis shows the actual measurements for each category, while the left-hand\naxis shows the fluctuations from expected standards (0.0). The gray lines indicate long-\nterm trends from 1900 to 2000, which demonstrates that ENSO and Volcanic Aerosols\ndo not contribute significantly to monthly mean global temperatures, while solar\nirradiance plays a minor role and anthropogenic forcing plays a major role (Lean and\nRind, 2008).\nThis type of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is unprecedented, as\ndemonstrated by ice core sampling from Lake Vostok in Antarctica (Figure 3). When the\namplitude of carbon dioxide concentration change is plotted against the time period of\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nchange, we see a sharp rise in carbon dioxide concentrations over the decade-century\ntime range due to human perturbation, while carbon dioxide changes attributed to\nglacial-interglacial activities exhibit a change in amplitude distributed over a time scale of\n105 years (Falkowski et al., 2000). Indeed, the global atmospheric carbon dioxide\nconcentration has risen from 280 ppm before the start of the Industrial Revolution\n(~1750) to 381 mm in 2006, showing a marked 36% increase (Canadell et al., 2007).\nFigure 3. Carbon dioxide concentration changes in the atmosphere plotted against the\ntime period during which the change occurred, based on Lake Vostok ice core samples.\nNotice that the marked effects of human perturbation to carbon dioxide concentration\noccurred on a decade to century scale, while glacial-interglacial changes were\ndistributed over a period of thousands of years (Falkowski et al., 2000).\nOne major societal implication due to global warming caused by rising carbon\ndioxide levels that is of significant concern in this century is the disappearance of low-\nlying island nations due to rising sea levels. Studies have indicated that the entire\ndisappearance of island nations lying a few meters above the ocean surface is highly\npossible, given the rapid annual melting of polar ice. For example, the island nation of\nMaldives is extremely vulnerable to the rise in sea levels, with the entire nation lying less\nGra\nph\nof\nCO2\ndi\nstu\nrban\nces\nby\namp\nlit\nude\nan\nd y\near\ns f\nor\ngla\ncial\n-int\nergl\nacial periods, human\nperterbation, ann\nual cycle, a\nnd diurnal cy\ncle.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nthan 5 meters above the sea level (Pelling and Ullito, 2001). With projected global sea-\nlevel increases of 3 to 5 meters due to possible future disintegration of Greenland and\nWest Antarctic ice sheets (Dasgupta et al., 2009), the nation of Maldives may be\npermanently be erased from the face of the Earth should global warming contribute to\nthe melting of these ice reserves.\nThe rise in global warming also contains ecological implications, such as the\npoleward migration of fauna and flora, changes in migration season of migratory\nspecies, and changes in breeding seasons of animals (Walther et al., 2002). A logical\nimplication of this effect is species extinction, as exhibited by the example of species\nliving on island ecosystems - if the species reach the northern or southern coastline due\nto a ecosystem shift caused by climate change and there is nowhere else to propagate,\nthe species may simply become extinct.\nGeoengineering\nKeith (2000) defines the concept of geoengineering as the \"intentional large-\nscale manipulation of the environment, particularly manipulation that is intended to\nreduce undesired anthropogenic climate change.\" In order for schemes to qualify as\ngeoengineering, however, Keith identifies three important elements - scale, intent, and\nmanipulation. An observed result with intent but without scale (ornamental gardening)\nand scale without intent (carbon dioxide increase in the atmosphere due to industry)\ncannot qualify as geoengineering schemes. Finally, geoengineering must go further than\nmitigation. Mitigation techniques, which are not a subset of geoengineering (Wigley,\n2006), adjust current practices (lowering carbon dioxide emissions of industrial plants),\nbut do not directly manipulate through introducing new environmental measures. For\nexample, carbon sequestration techniques (adding iron into oceans to stimulate plankton\n\ngrowth, injection of carbon dioxide into saline aquifers) qualify as geoengineering, while\nthe global reduction of emission levels by power plants can only be categorized as\nmitigation.\nIn the 1992 report on greenhouse warming published by the National Academy of\nScience, reforestation, \"sunlight screening\" (albedo modification techniques), \"ocean\nbiomass stimulation\" (ocean fertilization), and removal of atmospheric\nchlorofluorocarbons are identified as the four subfields under geoengineering. Albedo\ntechniques aim at raising the Earth's albedo, so sunlight is reflected back into space.\nThe other three techniques aim at reducing the amount of greenhouse gases trapped in\nthe atmosphere, either through sequestration via trees in the forest, photosynthetic\nplankton, or laser destruction of atmospheric chlorofluorocarbon particles (Committee on\nScience, Engineering, and Public Policy (U.S.), 1992).\nLal's (2008) study on sequestration techniques for atmospheric carbon dioxide\nprovides a review of current practices, broadly categorizing methods into three\ncategories: sequestration via aquatic ecosystems, sequestration via terrestrial\necosystems, and geoengineering techniques. Lal adopts a restrictive definition on\ngeoengineering technology, constraining geoengineering to carbon-capture techniques\nresulting in the injection of the liquefied captured carbon dioxide into geological\nformations (saline aquifers or basalt) or under the ocean surface. Terrestrial methods\ndiscussed include reforestration, ocean fertilization, and sequestration in soil (through\nconservation cropping or biochar application). Finally, aquatic techniques focus on the\nimprovement of carbon containment in aquatic ecosystems such as wetlands and\nmangroves (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4. The figure graphically presents current methods used in carbon sequestration,\nbroken down into geoengineering schemes and sequestration through aquatic and\nterrestrial ecosystems. Although Lal does not list biochar burial under a geoengineering\nscheme, biochar is categorized in this figure to fall under \"below ground biomass\" under\n\"biota\" and \"terrestrial ecosystem\" (Lal, 2008).\nMajor challenges underlying geoengineering technologies include cost,\nfeasibility, and unintended consequences. The installation of a space mirror has been\nsuggested as a way to counter global warming by reflecting incoming sunlight back into\nspace, countering global warming. However, current technology does not yet permit this\nadvance and costs are certain to be astronomical. A study indicated that painting every\nrooftop of the 100 largest metropolitan cities in the world white will trigger an\natmospheric effect equivalent to the removal of 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide per year,\ndue the increase in global albedo (Akbari and Menon, 2008). Nonetheless, the feasibility\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nof this proposal depends on widespread international cooperation, dialogue between\nnational governments, and citizen activism. Finally, although the feasibility of ocean\nfertilization has been extensively studied, the technology was never implemented on a\nlarge scale, due to fear of unintended irreversible damages to the environment\n(Chisholm et al., 2001; Cullen and Boyd, 2008).\nCarbon Sequestration Strategy via Biochar Burial\nThe introduction of biochar (charcoal or carbon derived from biomass via\npyrolysis) to the soil produces a long-term carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems\n(Lehmann et al., 2006). Biochar is produced by heating of biomass by pyrolysis, a\nheating process in the absence of oxygen (or partial combustion in the presence of a\nsmall quantity of oxygen) (Bridgwater, 2003).\nThe discovery of biochar as a possible application to carbon sequestration\noriginated from the dark \"terra preta\" soils of the Amazonian forest. Researchers\ndiscovered that terra preta soils contained up to 2.7 times amount of organic carbon as\nregular soil, which is attributed to the high black-carbon content (Glaser et al., 2001).\nBlack carbon is generated from the charred residues of biomass after a forest fire and\nhas been speculated as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide since 1996 (Kuhlbusch et\nal. 1996).\nIn normal photosynthesis, plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nand incorporate the carbon into biomass through photosynthesis. Once the plant\ndegenerates or is burned, however, the carbon is returned to the atmosphere. The\npremise of using biochar as a sequestration technique rest on the idea that a portion of\nthe carbon from the plant matter is transformed into high-yield carbon matter (biochar)\nvia the pyrolysis process, which can be stored underground and does not contain the\n\nrisk of re-release of carbon into the atmosphere. In addition, the energy produced during\npyrolysis can be harnessed and recycled as a carbon-neutral form of bioenergy\n(compare to the burning of fossil fuel, which releases additional carbon into the\natmosphere during energy release) (Figure 5).\nIn general, scientists do not advocate converting existing forests into biochar for\nthe purpose of carbon sequestration. Instead, scientists advocate these three avenues\nfor biochar application: the adoption of \"slash-and-char\" farming methods, using charcoal\nwaste as biochar, and turning plant refuse into biochar (Lehmann et al., 2006). When\nclearing fields, traditional farmers often clear the land by removing plant growth and\nburning it (\"slash-and-burn\"), allowing unchecked release of carbon dioxide into the air.\nThrough plant material pyrolysis in a standard kiln after removal from the field (\"slash\nand-char\"), 50% of the carbon can be sequestered in biochar, preventing re-release of\ncarbon into the atmosphere (Lehmann et al., 2002). In addition, charcoal waste from\ncooking and industrial plant waste (from the logging industry or paper mills) can also be\ntransformed into biochar through kilns or pyrolysis processors (Lehmann et al., 2006).\nAccording to the International Biochar Initiative's estimates, biochar technology\ncan successfully offset a quarter of a gigaton of carbon by the year 2030. Adopting more\noptimistic estimates through more aggressive methods, human beings may even be able\nto bring that figure up to one gigaton by 2050 (International Biochar Initiative, 2009).\n\nFigure 5. The schematic shows the comparison between the standard carbon cycle (0%\nnet carbon withdrawal from the atmosphere) compared with the introduction of biochar\nfor carbon sequestration (20% net carbon withdrawal from the atmosphere). This\ndifference in net carbon withdrawal from the atmosphere demonstrates that biochar may\npotentially be used as a method to sequester atmospheric carbon (International Biochar\nInitiative, 2009).\nAlthough Lal (2008) does not categorize biochar as a geoengineering technique\nin his assessment of carbon sequestration methods, biochar application may still be\nconsidered as a geoengineering technique if the three criteria provided by Keith (2000)\nare applied. Utilizing biochar for carbon sequestration introduces a dynamic approach\naimed at reducing the level of atmospheric carbon, fulfilling the criterion of manipulation.\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nThe two other key points are scale and intent, which is demonstrated by a long-term,\nmulti-national, global application of biochar for the purposes of carbon sequestration. For\nthe purposes of the following discussion, these premises will be assumed.\nAssessing Biochar Burial as a Carbon Sequestration\nStrategy Through Experimentation\nPotential Negative Effects of Biochar\nMany scientists view biochar as the end-all solution to carbon dioxide emissions.\nOne of the strongest proponents of biochar research, Johannes Lehmann, pointed out\noptimistically, \"If biochar could be massively applied around the globe, we could end the\nemissions problem in one to two years.\" (Abend, 2008) Tim Flannery, the chair of the\nCopenhagen Climate Council, noted, \"Slow pyrolysis biochar is a superior solution of\n[drawing down the carbon stock in the atmosphere] to anything else that's been\nproposed.\" (Abend, 2008)\nThe optimism stemming from biochar technology comes from its capacity of\ncontaining 25 kg of stable carbon for every 100 kg of biomass produced. This represents\n91.5 kg of carbon dioxide, of which 88% are stored as stable carbon (Day et al., 2005).\nSteinbass et al. (2009) calculated carbon residence times in biochar to be from 4 to 29\nyears, demonstrating the effectiveness of biochar as a carbon sink. In regards to\ngreenhouse gas containment, Rondon and Lehmann (2005) showed that the addition of\ncharcoal to pots containing soybean eliminated nearly all methane fluxes and 50 to 80%\nof nitrous oxide fluxes. Additionally, biochar can also improve agricultural productivity.\nWhen applied in conjunction with nitrogen fertilizer, biochar is capable of significantly\n\nimproving plant crop yields by maximizing the efficiency of nitrogen assimilation (Chan et\nal., 2007).\nHowever, current gaps in ongoing research may still be identified. In order for\nbiochar application to be considered as a geoengineering scheme, there must be an\nelement of scale. Currently, biochar derived from pyrolysis is produced in commercial\npyrolysis machines, which are expensive (e.g. $100,000) and must be engineered by\ncompanies who specialize in the production of these machines (Austin, 2009).\nConsequently, a large-scale dissemination of these machines around the world is highly\nimpractical. Biochar can also be produced through traditional pyrolysis machinery, such\nas the pit kiln, the mound kiln, the brick kiln, and the transportable metal kiln, all of which\ncauses additional carbon emission problems during biochar production (Lehmann and\nJoseph, 2009). Commercial pyrolysis machines harvest the gases produced during the\npyrolysis process (syngas) into energy sources, but traditional kilns do not recover the\nsyngas. The sheer amount of carbon gases emitted from the biochar manufacturing\nprocess in these traditional methods may be enough to counteract any positive benefits\nof carbon sequestration stemming from biochar application. Therefore, a careful analysis\nof traditional methods of producing biochar must be conducted to examine the adverse\neffects from released emissions.\nIn addition to the syngas byproduct, bio-oil is also another byproduct of pyrolysis.\nDuring the heating of biomass, the amount of solid char decreases, as carbon contained\nin the biomass is released steadily through chemical reactions (Emmons and Atreya,\n1982). William and Besler (1996) observed that, as the temperature is increased in the\nbiomass heating system, the liquid yield shows a corresponding increase. Therefore,\nthey hypothesized that the liquid, now known commonly as bio-oil, must be the result of\nvolatilization of hydrocarbon molecules originally contained in the biomass. The bio-oils\ncan be harnessed as an energy source due to their rich carbon content (Mohan et al.\n\n2006). Chemically, bio-oil is produced by the devolatilization of cellulose and\nhemicellulose, which happens during the transformation of the biomass into charcoal\n(Piskorz et al., 1986). As such, the hydrocarbon content contained in biochar after\npyrolysis is highly variable, depending on how much of the carbon has been transformed\ninto bio-oil. Because excess hydrocarbon present in the soil is toxic (Alexander, 1995),\nany large-scale application of biochar warrants further experimentation on its influence\non soil toxicity. This may be measured through the application of biochar to a tract of soil\nand subsequently determining the crop productivity of the plot.\nFrom this discussion, we have identified two unintended consequences of\napplying biochar on a large-scale basis - excess carbon dioxide emissions from the\nbiochar production process through traditional kilns and potential effects on soil toxicity\ndue to residual hydrocarbon content contained in biochar generated. These effects are\nimportant factors to determine because excess carbon dioxide emissions from the\nproduction of biochar process may be enough to counteract any potential carbon\nsequestration benefits from the biochar generated and soil toxicity from residual\nhydrocarbon in biochar may render a plot of land with buried biochar unsuitable for\ncultivation. This latter implication is especially important, as with the current strains in\nfood production to ensure adequate food supplies (von Braun, 2007), we cannot afford\nto turn arable land simply into biochar burial plantations.\nIn addition, the differences between commercial (modern) pyrolysis machines\nand traditional kilns are summarized in Table 1. Currently, traditional kilns are much\nmore prevalent and accessible than commercial pyrolysis machines. However, there\nexist many concerns regarding the syngas, bio-oil, and residual hydrocarbon content in\nthe biochar production process by traditional kilns.\n\nTable 1. Comparison Between Commercial (Modern) Pyrolysis Machines and Traditional\nKilns\nCommercial (Modern)\nPyrolysis Machines\nTraditional Kilns\nSyngas produced\n(e.g. carbon gases)\nRecycled as fuel or\nchemically processed\nReleased into the air\nBio-oil produced\nHarvested as fuel\nDiscarded\nResidual\nhydrocarbon\ncontent in biochar\nCan be regulated by\ncontrolling heating rate\nand maximal temperature\nCannot be regulated\nprecisely\nManufacturing cost\nVery high\nMaterials available locally\nPrevalence\nVery scarce, due to cost\nFound in many countries\nProposed Hypotheses\nThe potential adverse effects of utilizing biochar for carbon sequestration have\nnot yet been extensively studied. Such a study has two goals (Figure 1). The first is to\nmeasure carbon emissions from commercial pyrolysis machines and traditional kilns.\nThe second is to determine the effects of biochar on soil toxicity, after determination of\nhydrocarbon content in the biochar produced by different production methods using\ndifferent heating rates and maximum temperatures. These goals are depicted in a\nschematic (Figure 6):\n\nFigure 6. This schematic demonstrates the experimental procedure aimed at measuring\ncarbon emission effects of biochar production and soil toxicity effects stemming from\nresidual hydrocarbon content in biochar, which we identified as two unintended\nconsequences from the global application of biochar as a geoengineering scheme.\nWith respect to Goal One, we hypothesize that traditional kilns (without a syngas\ncycling system) will produce disproportionate amounts of carbon emissions, enough to\ncompletely or nearly completely counteract the amount of carbon sequestration potential\nby the biochar produced. On the other hand, we hypothesize that commercial hydrolysis\nmachines with a syngas-cycling system will generate minimal carbon emissions, making\ncarbon sequestration via biochar possible.\nWith respect to Goal Two, after the hydrocarbon content of biochar products\nformed at varying temperatures and heating rates are determined, different biochar\nsamples will be placed in tropical soil tracts to measure soil toxicity induced by the\nhydrocarbon content contained in the added biochar. We hypothesize that soil toxicity\neffects (measured through crop productivity) will be less in fields containing biochar\ncontaining smaller hydrocarbon concentrations, making the residual hydrocarbon\ncontent of biochar a key element in the implementation of biochar burial as a\ngeoengineering scheme. If there is a correlation between residual hydrocarbon content\n\nand reduced crop productivity due to soil toxicity induced by the hydrocarbon, then the\nglobal application of biochar may not be feasible if the residual hydrocarbon content is\ntoo high.\nExperimental Design\nThe analysis of unintended consequences in biochar application used as a\ngeoengineering scheme (Figure 1) may be broken down into three different smaller\nexperiments: analyzing carbon emissions, analyzing hydrocarbon content, and analyzing\nsoil toxicity. Although the analysis of hydrocarbon content does not address a direct\nunintended consequence of the application of biochar, it is a key element that precedes\nthe soil toxicity experiment and still merits its own experimental procedures.\nAnalyzing Carbon Emissions of Conventional Kilns and Pyrolysis\nMachines\nIn this experiment, we will compare the carbon emissions stemming from the\nbiochar production process by conventional kilns and modern pyrolysis machines.\nConventional kilns do not recycle the syngas released in the pyrolysis reaction, and the\nresulting carbon-rich gas is released into the atmosphere following a pyrolysis cycle,\nwhen biochar is harvested. Modern pyrolysis machines capture the syngas and either\ntreat the gas through catalysts and chemical scrubbing (Austin, 2009) or recycle the gas\nto be used as an energy source, such as in fuel cell systems (Arni et al., 2009).\nBecause most models of pyrolysis machines that utilize syngas recycling produce little to\nno emissions, the focus will be placed on measuring carbon emissions produced by a\ntypical kiln in the production of biochar.\n\nThe experiment will comprise the measurement of carbon emissions by\nconventional pyrolysis kilns, including the pit kiln, the mound kiln, the brick kiln, and the\ntransportable metal kiln, as detailed in Lehmann (2009). Each kiln will be placed in a\ndistinct, sealed chamber for the duration of the experiment. Ten kilograms of elephant\ngrass (Pennicetum purpureum schum) will undergo pyrolysis in each of these four kilns\nat a heating rate of 10 degrees Celsius per minute. The pyrolysis reaction will be capped\nat 720 degrees Celsius, because we want to include the peak right after 600 degrees\nCelsius - the point of maximal gas production in the pyrolysis process (William and\nBesler, 1996). Elephant grass is chosen as the biomass source for this experiment (as\nwell as the following experiments) because the plant is abundant, rapidly propagating,\nand holds promising potential as a biochar source for the future (Strezov et al., 2008).\nDuring the pyrolysis process (defined from the initiation of the pyrolysis reaction to the\nremoval of biochar from the chamber), the amount of the gases released and contained\nin the sealed chamber will be measured. Gases will be characterized via column gas\nchromatography, with a special emphasis on identifying carbon monoxide, hydrogen gas,\nmethane, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons produced.\nThe experiment will be repeated three times with each kiln to ensure accuracy\nand validity of the gas measurements. After error analysis, the amount of carbon\nemissions produced by each kiln in the process of biochar production will be compared\nagainst the calculated carbon sequestration potential of the biochar produced by the kiln,\nusing estimates derived from Lehmann (2006). We hypothesize that the carbon\nemissions produced by each conventional kiln will far outweigh the carbon sequestration\npotential of the biochar generated.\nAnalyzing the Hydrocarbon Content of Biochar\n\nIn the second experiment, we will measure the amount of residual hydrocarbon\ncontained in biochar obtained from pyrolysis. Since temperature and the rate of heating\nboth influences the composition of produced biochar, we will control for these two\nvariables (William and Besler, 1996). Using a syngas-recycling pyrolysis machine and a\nbrick kiln (as the representative of conventional kilns), ten kilograms of elephant grass\nwill undergo pyrolysis trials following the experimental conditions given by William and\nBessler (1996) (Table 2).\nTable 2. Experimental Design of Hydrocarbon Content Analysis\nRate of Heating\n(oC per minute)\nMaximum Temperature\n(oC)\nIn Table 2, the rate of heating refers to the rate of temperature increase in the\npyrolysis chamber, given in degrees of Celsius per minute. The maximum temperature\nrefers to the maximum temperature attained during the pyrolysis cycle before the\npyrolysis reaction is terminated. Both the syngas-recycling pyrolysis machine and the\nbrick kiln runs through all the trials, yielding a total of twenty-four trials.\nAlthough the experimental set-up may seem to repeat William and Besler's\npyrolysis experiments, we aim instead to take the solid char generated through the\npyrolysis process for each trial and analyze for hydrocarbon content. Hydrocarbon\ncontent will be assessed through the gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS)\nmethod. From William and Besler's experimental outline, biochar generated at the\n\nexperimental conditions where the greatest amount of bio-oil is produced is expected to\ncontain the minimum amount of residual hydrocarbon content. The reasoning behind this\nis that the hydrocarbon content originally contained in the biomass is largely transferred\nto the bio-oil.\nSoil Toxicity Analysis\nThe biochar produced in the hydrocarbon content analysis experiment will be\nutilized in the soil toxicity experiment, where we aim to uncover a correlation between\nsoil toxicity and hydrocarbon content in biochar. Three biochar samples produced from\nthe hydrocarbon content analysis will be used in this experiment, including the sample\nwith the lowest hydrocarbon concentration, a sample with a mid-range hydrocarbon\nconcentration, and the sample with the highest hydrocarbon concentration. As controls,\nwe will include samples of natural fertilizer with the same hydrocarbon concentration\n(through chemical additions of hydrocarbon) as those found in the biochar samples.\nThese controls help to delineate the specific effects of biochar on the soil by comparing it\nagainst regular fertilizer, when hydrocarbon content is controlled for.\nThe soil toxicity analysis will be conducted in tropical soil to mimic the native\nenvironment in which terra preta is found. Experiments will be conducted in square plots\nof 10 meters by 10 meters, which have similar initial soil profiles determined before the\nexperiment. The plots will be located in a contiguous tract of land, to control against\nenvironmental differences stemming from geography. Each plot is cleared of existing\nplant vegetation and sufficiently aerated and irrigated in preparation for planting.\nThe same amount of biochar by weight of the different samples (three low,\nmedium, high hydrocarbon content biochar and the corresponding natural fertilizer\ncontrols) will be applied to the plots, for a total of three experimental and three control\n\nplots. The biochar added will be pelletized and distributed in a uniform fashion across\nthe experimental fields, buried half a meter underground. Natural fertilizer control will be\ndistributed in a similar fashion in the control fields. Radish (Raphanus sativus) will be\nchosen as the experimental plant subject, and twenty germinated young plants will be\nadded to each plot following biochar or fertilizer application. Radish is chosen as the\nexperimental plant subject for several reasons: its small size, fast growing time (24-30\ndays under ideal conditions), and the formation of distinct shoot and root systems that\nclearly indicate carbon source and sink (Kostka-Rick and Manning, 1993). Young plants\nare chosen in order to eliminate any background effects relating to seed germination.\nThree replicates of the experimental and control plots will be created in order to ensure\nbetter experimental accuracy.\nRadish growth will be conducted for a period of 6 weeks over the late spring to\nearly summer, during the months of May and June. The plots will be watered three times\na week with tap water but will otherwise be subject to normal weather conditions during\nthe test period. After 6 weeks, the radish plants will be harvested by carefully uprooting\nexisting plants, the plants will be cleaned with tap water, and the lengths of the shoot\nand root systems will be measured for each plant. The plants will then be oven dried at\n80 degrees Celsius for 48 hours, and the dry weight of the shoot and root systems\nmeasured separately. The above harvest protocol is adapted from soil fertility\nexperiments conducted by Chidumayo (1994).\nThe measurements will be collated separately for each experimental and control\nsample, and the three experimental replicate results will be incorporated. We\nhypothesize that the field with the least concentration of hydrocarbons will result in the\nbest radish productivity, measured through shoot and root measurements and the\nresulting dry weight yield of the plants. The differences in soil toxicity between biochar\nsamples and natural fertilizer controls with the same amount of hydrocarbon content is\n\nunclear, so we will be also testing for this by noting the productivity between fields\ncontaining the same amount of hydrocarbon concentration.\nExpected Results, Conclusions, and Further\nRecommendations on Biochar as a Geoengineering Scheme\nExpected Results\nThrough the carbon emissions analysis experiment, we would expect that\ntraditional kilns would generate a disproportionate amount of carbon emissions that will\nmake the carbon sequestration potential of the biochar generated quite minimal or\nnonexistent. On the other hand, we would expect that commercial pyrolysis machines\nwould generate a minimal amount of carbon emissions, since the emitted gases are\nrecycled or chemically treated.\nThrough the soil toxicity experiment, we would expect that tracts containing\nbiochar with the least amount of residual hydrocarbon content would produce the\ngreatest crop yield (as measured by the dry weight and the length of the radishes\nproduced). On the other hand, we would expect that tracts containing biochar with the\nmost amount of residual hydrocarbon content would produce the smallest crop yield. In\nregards to the control with chemical fertilizer with added hydrocarbon, we would expect\nthere to be little difference between the biochar and the fertilizer samples.\nFuture Recommendations\nFrom the carbon emissions analysis experiment, we would recommend the\nimplementation of commercial pyrolysis machines to be used in the generation of\n\nbiochar, as opposed to traditional kilns because of the difference in carbon emissions\nduring the biochar production process.\nFurthermore, from the soil toxicity experiment, we see that residual hydrocarbon\ncontent in the biochar plays a major role in the resulting crop productivity in tracts\ncontaining buried biochar, due to soil toxicity effects. This reinforces our\nrecommendation for the implementation of commercial pyrolysis machines because they\ncan control for maximal temperature and heating rate during the pyrolysis process\naccurately, which directly affects the hydrocarbon content in the biochar produced. In\ntraditional kilns, these experimental conditions are very hard to control accurately, and\nconsequently hydrocarbon content in produced biochar is also highly variable.\nPreviously, we have presented the prohibitive cost of commercial pyrolysis\nmachines, which logistically causes shortages of these machines in developing countries.\nA proposed solution is for governments to purchase a certain number of these\ncommercial pyrolysis machines and circulate the machines amongst farmers in different\nparts of the country on a regular schedule for biochar creation. This reduces the burden\nof a small group of individuals purchasing and owning pyrolysis machines, and makes\nbiochar more accessible for normal farmers. As described above, in addition to its\ncarbon sequestration properties, biochar has demonstrated fertilizer capabilities, and if\napplied in the right amount with the hydrocarbon content controlled for, biochar may be\nable to improve crop yields by maximizing nitrogen assimilation efficiency (Chan et al.,\n2007). This may prove to be further incentive for the introduction and the propagation of\nbiochar for the future, aside from purely carbon sequestration purposes.\nBiochar and the Future\n\nCritics of implementing biochar burial on a global basis as a geoengineering\nscheme have cited difficulties such as large-scale deforestation in anticipation of the\ncreation of massive biochar burial tracts used to sequester carbon. In addition, critics\nhave also questioned the logic of creating crop plantations where the crop yield is used\nsolely for the production of the biochar. However, we believe that these two major\nproblems can be circumvented easily.\nThrough the proposed soil toxicity experiment outlined in this proposal, we can\ndefinitively determine biochar's unintended side effects on crop productivity and soil\ntoxicity, and subsequently there will be no need for large-scale deforestation projects to\nclear land for biochar burial. Biochar can be buried in farmland that are already\nproductive, perhaps even serving as fertilizer similar to the terra preta that has existed in\nthe Amazon basin for centuries.\nFurthermore, biochar can be created from agricultural waste very easily, and\nthere is no need to plant new plantations to provide biomass for the generation of\nbiochar. Of the estimated 60.6 billion tons of NPP that is produced by the planet every\nyear, about ten percent turns into agricultural and forestry waste, such as corn stalks\nand leaf litter (Kleiner, 2009). If all this waste was regenerated as biochar through\npyrolysis, 3 billion tons of biochar will be produced annually, which would lead to a\nreduction of atmospheric carbon emissions by approximately also 3 billion tons\n(Amonette et al., 2007). Considering 4.1 billion tons of excess carbon dioxide\naccumulates in the atmosphere every year, this will help to offset a significant portion of\nthat imbalance.\nThere is still a large amount of research ongoing in the use of biochar in carbon\nsequestration, but we remain optimistic on the outcome. We strongly endorse and\nrecommend further research on biochar as a possible method to address the rising\ncarbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.\n\nGeoengineering and the Future\nWith the advances that humankind has witnessed in the last two hundred years,\nit may seem ironic that we are turning again to technology to remedy the global\nproblems that have been created as a byproduct of our technological progress. The\nconcept of geoengineering has become a revolutionary concept in ecology in recent\nyears, but as this experimental proposal has demonstrated, there are multiple sides to\nthe problem and we must proceed cautiously.\nOur Earth is an ecosystem that is tightly interlinked in a web of life - one species\nleading to another, one cycle influencing another. Any disruption in this environment\ncauses the whole system to shift in a different direction to compensate for the\ndisturbance. Keeping this in mind, our experiments with this system need to be guided\nwith reason and prudence. However, the results can also be informative and rewarding -\ngeoengineering experiments at the Hubbard Brook National Forest through the 1960s\nproduced a landmark study in 1968 that focused national attention on the effects of acid\nrain on soil, forest, and lake ecosystems, directly leading to the Clean Air Act and\nadditional amendments enacted through the 1970s to the 1990s.\nIn conclusion, we would like to come back to the fundamental definition of\napplied ecology as given by Remmert in 1980, \"In its applied form, ecology faces the\nproblem of discovering how the conditions essential for present-day life can be\nmaintained.\" As our world begins to tip out of balance, it is our duty as citizens of the\nworld - as more than just ecologists - to discover how to reverse those adverse effects.\nAlthough geoengineering may not (yet) be the perfect solution, it is a step in addressing\nthis unique challenge - to ensure that our planet will continue to be hospitable for our\nchildren, our children's children, and so on till posterity.\n\nReferences\nAbend, Lisa (2008, December 4).

      "content": "Investigation of the effects of stratospheric sulfur\ninjection on terrestrial autotroph productivity via\nexperimentation with diffuse radiation controlled\ngreenhouses\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.018/7.30J\nFall 2009\n\nExecutive Summary\nPopulation growth and the development of more energy demanding technologies have\nled to an increase in fossil fuel combustion since the Industrial Revolution. As a byproduct of\nfossil fuel combustion greenhouse gases have reached unprecedented levels in the\natmosphere. The disruption of Earth's equilibrium has resulted in the development of several\nschemes to mitigate global climate change, one of which is geoengineering - the intentional\nmanipulation of the environment on a planetary scale.\nThe focus of this proposal will be on the unintended consequences of one particular\ngeoengineering scheme: the injection of sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere. Increasing the\nconcentration of sulfate particles in the atmosphere will increase Earth's albedo, as these\nparticles reflect some of the sun's radiation back into space. Large-scale injection of sulfate\naerosols into the stratosphere can result in unintended consequences such as acid rain, ozone\ndepletion, and effects on terrestrial productivity.\nThe experiment described in this proposal was designed to enlighten our understanding\nof the implications of stratospheric sulfur injection and yield a better idea of the practicality of\nlarge-scale application. The experiment utilizes a series of diffuse radiation controlled\ngreenhouses that intend to mimic the affect that sulfate aerosols have on incoming radiation by\nuse of different greenhouse glazing materials. The goal is to understand how a change in\nradiation brought about by stratospheric sulfur injection affects terrestrial autotroph productivity.\nThe results of this experiment will help to create a more comprehensive and full understanding\nof the unintended consequences of injecting sulfur into the stratosphere.\nThe proposed experiment investigates the effect that alteration of radiation brought\nabout by stratospheric sulfur injection has on terrestrial productivity. Our results will show either\na positive correlation between alternation of radiation and productivity or they may reveal a\nnegative relationship. If the results do reveal that increased concentrations of sulfate aerosols\nresult in increased autotrophic productivity we are actually finding that this particular\ngeoengineering scheme is dually effective in that it cools the planet by deflecting radiation and\nincreases the carbon sink potential of terrestrial autotrophs. The ability of stratospheric sulfur\ninjection to mitigate global change in more than one way would increase the viability of injecting\nsulfur into the stratosphere as opposed to other geoengineering schemes.\n\nAn Introduction to Global Climate Change\nSince Earth's formation there have been dramatic and cyclic variations in global climate.\nThe planetary climatic condition is the result of a complex system dependent on many factors\nincluding Earth's orbital behavior and the orientation of its axis, continental arrangement,\ngreenhouse gas concentrations, predominant life forms, and the strength of the sun's incident\nradiation (Desonie). Cyclic changes between glacial periods and interglacial periods are\nobserved on a geological time frame. A significant concern of modern times is that the growing\nhuman population has induced global climate change through the liberation of copious amounts\nof anthropogenic greenhouse gases. As a result of these emissions, we have transformed\natmospheric conditions and the biosphere at large in little more than a century.\nThe Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries resulted in\ninnumerable technological and scientific advancements. Unfortunately, many detrimental\nenvironmental effects accompanied these improvements. Fossil fuel combustion was used as a\nsource of energy long before the Industrial Revolution. However, the reliance on fossil fuel grew\nexponentially during this time due to significant population growth and the development of more\nenergy demanding technologies. Carbon dioxide, a radiative forcing greenhouse gas, is a\nbyproduct of fossil fuel combustion. Thus anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions have grown\nsince the pre-Industrial era from almost nothing to an annual average of approximately six billion\nmetric tons (Garrett, 1992). Today, carbon dioxide concentrations are over 100 parts per million\nhigher than the 280 ppm concentration in existence prior to the Industrial era (Bala, 2009). It is\nclearly evident that the momentous anthropogenic rise in carbon dioxide began during the time\nof the Industrial Revolution (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide concentration over the past 2000\nyears. (Vitousek, 1994).\nThe troubling aspect of carbon dioxide growth is that the anthropogenic increase of the\npast few centuries is comparable to concentration changes observed in glacial/interglacial\ntransition periods (Vitousek, 1994). Natural climatic transitions occur over a long period of time\nsuch that adaptation can occur. In contrast, human induced changes have occurred at ten times\nthis natural rate (Vitousek, 1994). The escalated pace of climate change will require more rapid\nadaptation. For that reason, fossil fuel combustion and its rapid effects threaten the future of\nmany existing species.\nIn the past, the biogeochemical carbon cycle operated through a balanced cycle of\nexchange. Carbon dioxide primarily entered the atmosphere via respiration and the decay of\norganic matter. Photosynthesis and deep ocean storage then provided the mechanisms to\nbalance this system by removing atmospheric carbon dioxide. The anthropogenic increase in\ncarbon dioxide through fossil fuel combustion, deforestation and concrete manufacturing,\nalthough small in comparison with natural contributions, has disrupted this balance (Garrett,\n1992). As displayed in figure 2, the carbon cycle does not have the means to handle the\nelevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and it follows that much carbon dioxide\nremains in the atmosphere.\nGra\nph\nsho\nwing\nthe\nris\ne in carbon dioxid\ne conce\nntration in the last 2000 years.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nFigure 2 Annual fluxes of the sources and sinks of the global carbon\ncycle in billions of metric tons of carbon. Sources and sinks flow into\nreservoirs such as terrestrial soil and vegetation and deep-sea\nsequestration. Sources and sinks include photosynthesis,\ndecomposition and fossil-fuel combustion and are represented by\narrows in the figure (Garrett, 1992).\nGlobal warming is observed because an increase in greenhouse gas concentration\nresults in the decrease of unabsorbed radiation escaping back into space. About 30% of the\nsun's radiation reaching Earth is emitted back into space prior to any atmospheric absorption\n(Garrett, 1992). Then the impinging radiation interacts with greenhouse gases, such as\nmethane, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, water vapor and ozone, and is reradiated in the form of\ninfrared radiation (Garrett, 1992). The result is a warming effect on Earth's surface greater than\nthat which can be explained by the sun's incident radiation alone (Grassl, 2009). This is known\nas the greenhouse effect.\nRapid global climate change has large-scale ecological effects on the biosphere. The\nincrease in carbon dioxide, a reactant in photosynthesis, allows for the increase of\nphotosynthetic rates. Some autotrophic species are able to adapt to the environmental change\nmore quickly than others and will therefore gain a competitive advantage from increased carbon\ndioxide (Fajer, 1989). Another ecological problem arises in that the plants that do take\nadvantage of carbon dioxide more effectively will be producing tissues with lower nutrient\n\nconcentrations (Fajer, 1989). Therefore the growth rates of herbivores, decomposers, and other\norganisms further along the food chain will be hindered and the survival of such populations will\nbe threatened (Fajer, 1989). Global climate change also affects biodiversity because as the\nlocations of specific ecological environments shift species will need to redistribute themselves in\norder to survive. For example, the four degree Celsius rise of freshwater temperature expected\nin the near future will restrict the range that certain freshwater species can survive to a smaller\nlatitudinal range. (Heino, 2009).\nThe global climate change stimulated by human action will have a large influence on our\nspecies as well. Glaciers in the arctic regions have already begun to melt and in consequence\nseawater elevation is rising. It is predicted that within this century seawater elevation will rise\nbetween .18 and .59 meters (Dupont, 2008). This could render fertile coastal land unproductive\nand provoke food shortages. In addition to temperature rise, global climate change will\nencompass fluctuations in rainfall patterns. Rainfall fluctuations could create new areas of water\nshortages, thereby increasing the number of people with inadequate water supply (Dupont,\n2008).\nThe conditions that exist on Earth are the result of ecological evolutionary adaptations\nthat have taken place over the course of millennia (Remmert, 1980). The human species can\nexist only in the conditions that are now present (Remmert, 1980). Our own anthropogenic\nemissions threaten our species and the world at large. Global climate change and its effects\nhave recently gained much publicity and have instigated growing concern of what the future\nmay hold. Scientists and policymakers have been trying to discover practical, efficient methods\nto ameliorate the impact of human induced climate change. Geoengineering has arisen as a\npotential strategy that involves the intentional manipulation of the environment on a planetary\nscale.\n\nGeoengineering\nLarge-scale manipulation of the environment is not a geoengineering innovation; the\nidea has been around for quite some time. In fact, Arrhenius predicted the effects of significant\nfossil fuel combustion as early as 1905 (Keith, 2000). Although the analysis of Arrhenius and his\ncontemporaries focused on agricultural benefits that would arise from increased carbon dioxide,\ntheir predictions did hint at the idea of environmental manipulation. In the 1960's a scheme very\nsimilar to today's geoengineering arose known as weather and climate modification (Keith,\n2000). The United States and the U.S.S.R. planned to manipulate the environment via macro-\nscale engineering schemes. Both geoengineering and weather and climate modification have\nscale and intent in common; however, the intent of the two are quite different. The goal of\nweather and climate modification was to improve the natural climate and palliate natural\nhazards, while geoengineering aims to mitigate anthropogenic climatic effects. Since the 1960s\nthe seriousness of carbon dioxide concentration growth has been realized and emphasis has\nshifted from improving the natural climate to saving the natural climate.\nFigure 3 Major geoengineering schemes including nutrient\naddition, reforestation, increasing surface albedo and the\ninjection of stratospheric aerosols. The black arrowheads are\nindicative of short wave radiation reflected back into space\nwhile the white arrows symbolize carbon movement (Lenton,\n2009).\n\nGeoengineering strategies can be divided into two principle categories; schemes that\nreduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by Earth and schemes that increase the amount\nof radiation emitted (Figure 3).\nThe reduction of radiation absorption can be accomplished by limiting the quantity of\nsolar radiation that impinges upon the atmosphere in the first place or by increasing Earth's\nreflectivity or albedo. Proposed methods to reduce incoming radiation are the placement of\nreflective sunshades at the Lagrange point between the Sun and the Earth where gravity is\nminimized or placing smaller mirrors into orbits around Earth (Bala, 2009). Albedo enhancement\ncan be accomplished through the injection of sulfur into the stratosphere, increasing cloud\ncondensation nuclei, or even increasing urban albedo by painting roofs white (Lenton, 2009).\nThe other branch of geoengineering schemes expands off of the idea that the\ngreenhouse effect can be mitigated by the removal of excess carbon dioxide. These schemes\ntypically involve the transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide to terrestrial systems, to the deep\nocean, or to deep geological formations (Bala, 2009). Of the presented geoengineering\nschemes, this discussion will focus on the injection of sulfur into the stratosphere.\nGeoengineering by the Stratospheric Injection of Sulfur\nIt is likely that volcanic eruption was the inspiration for the geoengineering method of\nstratospheric sulfur injection. Volcanic eruptions release large quantities of various gases,\nincluding sulfate aerosols, into the atmosphere (Brovkin, 2009). In the first few years after a\nvolcanic eruption, a cooler climate may be observed due to sulfate aerosols responsible for\nincreased albedo. In a volcanically inactive year sulfate stratospheric additions total about 0.1\nteragrams (Rasch, 2008). The eruption of Mount Pinatubo resulted in a stratospheric sulfur\naddition of 100 times the annual contributions of inactive years (Rasch, 2008). This\n\ngeoengineering method is based upon the ability of stratospheric sulfate aerosols to increase\nreflectivity, as it is known to do in the case of volcanic eruptions. The natural and artificial\nmethods of sulfur injection are shown in figure 4.\nFigure 4 Stratospheric sulfur injection mimics volcanic\neruption. Both processes increase sulfate aerosol\nconcentration and increase planetary reflectivity.\nSource: http://www.nature.com/ nature/journal/v447\n/n7141/full/447132a.html\nThe geoengineering scheme departs from the volcanic eruption analogue in that the\nsulfur must remain in the stratosphere in order to mitigate the radiative imbalance. There are\nmany reasons why sulfur injection must take place in the stratosphere rather than the\ntroposphere. First of all, anthropogenic sulfur emissions in the troposphere have resulted in acid\nrain (Kravitz, 2009). Secondly, the mean residence time of sulfur in the troposphere is only\nabout a week while that of sulfur in the stratosphere is on the order of a few years (Crutzen,\n2006). The longer mean residence time of sulfur in the stratosphere means that it will be\npossible for the sulfate aerosols to achieve a higher degree of dispersal and will require less\nfrequent injections. Although this method of geoengineering involves a large change in\nstratospheric sulfur content, when taken into the context of the atmosphere at large the net\nsulfur change is not as significant and therefore less likely to produce undesirable environmental\neffects.\n\nSeveral methods have been proposed for the physical addition of sulfur to the\nstratosphere. All injections will be strategically located near an upward bound flow within the\nstratospheric circulation system to encourage thorough distribution and longer stratospheric\nlifetime (Crutzen, 2006). Proposed methods of injection include use of artillery shells and\nballoons to carry sulfur up to the stratosphere and release it once there. Other methods include\nsulfur injection via aircraft jet exhaust and long-term plume processing (Rasch, 2008). It is\nestimated that the annual addition of approximately 5 teragrams of sulfur could balance the\nwarming effect caused by doubled carbon dioxide concentration (Crutzen, 2006).\nMany factors influence the effectiveness of sulfate aerosols upon their injection into the\nstratosphere. Many of the proposed methods involve the transformation of injections from\nhydrogen sulfide and diatomic sulfur to sulfur dioxide and eventually to sub-micrometer sulfate\nparticles (Crutzen, 2006). Particle growth is a function of vapor deposition and concentration of\nthe sulfur compound in question (Rasch, 2008). Lower concentrations of sulfur correspond with\nlower partial pressures and the particles remain small (Bauman, 2003). Higher concentrations of\nsulfur compounds, such as those experienced after volcanic eruption, result in an increase in\nparticle size. There is an inverse relationship between particle size and the ability to scatter light\nefficiently: smaller particles are more effective albedo enhancers than larger sulfur particles\n(Bauman).\nSince geoengineering involves the manipulation of the environment on a planetary scale,\nthe associated effects will be felt worldwide. Although geoengineering intends to mitigate global\nwarming, there is a possibility that negative consequences may arise. It is very difficult to\nunderstand the full range of effects that geoengineering schemes could entail because there are\ninnumerable variables in ecological science. Thorough experimentation must be conducted and\nthe long-term effects of geoengineering must be more completely understood before we should\nconsider geoengineering as the best solution to the global climate change dilemma at hand.\n\nPotential Effects of Stratospheric Sulfur Injection\nSeveral potential unintended consequences of stratospheric sulfate aerosol manipulation\nhave already been focal points of debate. The destruction of ozone, sulfur depositions, and\neffects on the terrestrial biosphere, which will be the primary focus of this proposal, are\nprospective unintended consequences.\nOzone Destruction\nThe analog between volcanic eruptions and geoengineering by the injection of sulfate\naerosols into the stratosphere may hold true for the effect on ozone as well. The 1982 El\nChichon eruption released 3 - 5 terragrams of sulfur into the atmosphere and brought about\ndestruction of approximately 16% of the ozone at an altitude of 20 km in mid-latitude regions\n(Hofmann, 1989).\nThe physical ability of sulfate aerosols to destroy ozone relies on several factors. Sulfur\nparticles provide a surface that chlorine can utilize to become more reactive and capable of\nozone destruction. An increase in sulfur aerosol concentration therefore involves an increase in\nthe potential for the activation of chlorine (Tilmes, 2008). There is a direct relationship between\nthe potential for the activation of chlorine and ozone loss (Figure 1). By association we can then\nsay that the manipulation of sulfate aerosols will result in increased ozone loss.\n\nGraph\nshow\ning l\ninear\nrela\ntions\nhi\np b\netw\neen\npo\ntent\nial\nfor\nchlorine activat\nion and ozone loss.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nnegligible compared to that due to pollution (Robock, 2008). Experiments have been done to\ninvestigate acid deposition associated with sulfuric stratosphere injection and have produced\nresults that support the previous estimate. That is, the values of acid deposition are below\ncritical levels that would negatively affect most ecosystems (Kravitz, 2009). Environments\nwithout adequate methods of buffering acidity, such as freshwater ecosystems, are vulnerable\nto harm by increased acid deposition (Kravitz, 2009).\nEffect on Terrestrial Productivity\nThere is still much uncertainty associated with the potential effects of sulfuric stratosphere\nmanipulation on the terrestrial biosphere. The intent of injecting sulfur dioxide into the\nstratosphere is to increase the planet's albedo and thereby reflect more incident radiation back\ninto space. Aerosols also have another effect on incoming radiation; as light enters the aerosol-\nenriched stratosphere it will be reflected and reradiated such that diffuse radiation reaching the\nsurface will increase.\nThe photosynthetic process is dependent on light. Thus, variations in light brought about\nby albedo enhancement will affect rates of photosynthesis and consequently plant growth and\nprimary production. By removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere photosynthetic organisms\nplay an integral part in the biogeochemical carbon cycle. In the global climate change dilemma\nthat we face today the efficiency of terrestrial carbon sinks is of critical importance.\nEstimates concerning the effect of increased sulfate aerosols on terrestrial productivity\nhave been made and experiments to test these theories have been conducted. Some experts\nhave reasoned that the reduction in incoming solar radiation will decrease the photosynthetically\nactive radiation impinging upon the terrestrial biosphere and negatively affect net primary\nproductivity (Govindasamy, 2002). But a thorough review of relevant literature reveals that there\nis not a consensus on this issue.\nOther predictions have been made stating that a geoengineered stratosphere will actually\n\nincrease the diffuse radiation reaching the Earth's surface (Gu, 2003). At first it may seem\ncounterintuitive that this albedo enhancement method would result in increased diffuse radiation\nbecause it involves deflecting incoming direct radiation. Injection of sulfur into the stratosphere\ndoes decrease the total global solar radiation, a sum of the diffuse radiation and direct radiation\n(Gu, 2003). However, increased stratospheric aerosol concentrations results in an increase in\ndiffuse radiation (Gu, 2003).\nExperimentation has already tested the effect of modified radiation intensities on terrestrial\nproductivity but there is room for improvement. The lack of a consensus among experts reflects\nthat the many complex factors impacting the relationship between a sulfate aerosol enhanced\nstratosphere and terrestrial productivity make accurate prediction extremely difficult (Gu, 2003;\nWuebbles, 2001; Govindasamy, 2002). Further experimentation to prove and expand upon past\nresults is necessary to better understand what global aerosol manipulation will mean for net\nprimary productivity.\nA Review of Relevant Past Experiments\nA 2001 study by Wuebbles et al. found that a 1.8% decrease in solar radiation did not\ncause any significant reduction in net primary productivity (Wuebbles, 2001). A similar\nexperiment by Govindasamy reproduced similar results and it was concluded that small\nvariations in incident sunlight would not have a significant effect on plant productivity\n(Govindasamy, 2002). These studies made use of climate modeling technologies and\nGovindasamy acknowledges that his experiment lacks a representation of the oceanic system\nand potential feedbacks that it may involve (Govindasamy, 2002). Climate models are still being\ndeveloped and perfected so that they can address the complex components of the biosphere as\naccurately as possible. But this is an ongoing field of research and thus no climate model is\nwithout imperfection. An in situ experiment that produced results similar to that produced by\nclimate modeling would strengthen the reliability of the climate modeling result: that\n\nstratosphere aerosol manipulation does not significantly affect primary production.\nExperimentation via Diffuse Radiation Controlled Greenhouses (DRCG)\nUncertainty still exists in regard to the effect of stratospheric sulfur injection on terrestrial\nproductivity. Because the earth system is very complex and therefore difficult to model past\nexperimentation has yielded inconsistent conclusions. The proposed experiment makes use of\ndiffuse radiation controlled greenhouses (to be abbreviated DRCG) for a long-term investigation\nof the effect of a geoengineered stratosphere on productivity.\nHypotheses of the DRCG experiment\nI. Because the injection of sulfate aerosols into Earth's stratosphere will result in increased\nlevels of diffuse radiation there will be an increase in terrestrial autotroph productivity.\nII. The injection of sulfate aerosols also results in decreased direct radiation, which will act\nto lower primary productivity. However, the net change in productivity will be positive\nbecause plants are able to make better use of diffuse radiation than they can of direct\nradiation.\nIII. Increased stratospheric aerosol concentration may not have a significant effect on\nterrestrial autotrophs at first. However, the ability of some plants to make better use of\ndiffuse radiation than others could modify biodiversity in the long run.\nRecreating the Terrestrial Biosphere for Experimentation\nThe only way to completely understand the full range of effects brought on by stratosphere\naerosol manipulation would be to implement this geoengineering scheme on a global scale.\nHowever, this is a catch-22; we cannot put the biosphere at risk without knowing the range and\nseverity of the consequences. Instead, we design experiments to mimic the biosphere to the\n\nbest of our ability.\nTo test the effect of manipulated radiation on productivity this experiment will make use of\na series of greenhouses. Each greenhouse will contain an isolated ecosystem modeled after\nthree ecosystems that greatly contribute to global primary productivity. The ecosystems to be\nreplicated in the greenhouses include tropical rain forests, temperate deciduous forests and\ngrasslands. Two greenhouses will be placed at each location: one control and one DRCG. The\ngreenhouses will contain a ventilation system to control the temperature when it has become\ntoo hot or too cold. There will also be a plumbing system to maintain the correct level of\nmoisture in the soil and air.\nThe greenhouse environments will mimic the environments they represent. They will be\nplaced in their natural environment so as to receive the natural amount of incident sunlight. This\nmeans that the tropical rainforest greenhouse will be placed in Brazil, the temperate deciduous\nforest greenhouse in New York and the grassland greenhouse in Texas.\nThe environment of the tropical rainforest greenhouse will be specifically modeled after\nLatin American rain forests and will therefore be kept at a temperature of 26° C and receive\n4000 mm of precipitation each year (Smith, 2001). Plant species will include mango trees,\nyagrumo macho and trumpet trees but the replicated biodiversity will not be limited to these few\nlisted species because rainforests are especially diverse ecosystems (Lopes, 2009).\nThe temperate deciduous forest greenhouse will be characterized by European beech,\nashes, birches, and elm trees (Smith, 2001). The temperature should vary seasonably with the\nsurroundings between average lows of 20° F and highs of about 70° F, with about 980 mm of\nprecipitation a year (National Weather Service, 2009).\nThe Texas grassland greenhouse would be modeled after the Texas blackland prairies,\nwith temperatures varying from 35° F to 95° F and having a yearly rainfall of about 880 mm\n(National Weather Service, 2009). The flora of this greenhouse would predominately be big and\nlittle bluestem grasses, Indian grass, gamagrass and switchgrass (World Wildlife Fund, 2001).\n\nExperimental Variable: Greenhouse Glazing and Diffuse Radiation\nGreenhouse coverings and stratospheric aerosols affect incoming radiation in a similar\nway. Greenhouse glazing reflects direct radiation and therefore decreases the direct radiation\nthat reaches the plants (Giacomelli, 1993). Like stratospheric aerosol injection, greenhouse\nglazing also increases diffuse radiation reaching plants (Giacomelli, 1993). The greenhouse\ncovering's effect on incoming radiation is summarized in figure 3. The greenhouse serves as a\ngood analog to model the effect of this geoengineering scheme without physically manipulating\nthe atmosphere.\nFigure 3 The effect of double polyethylene layer on\nincoming radiation. The red arrows represent diffuse\nradiation that is magnified by the glazing. The yellow\narrows are direct radiation, some of which is reflected\nat the surface.\nThe variable in this experiment is incoming diffuse radiation. Different greenhouse glazing\nmaterials will be utilized to manipulate and control the levels of diffuse radiation. To model the\nnatural state the control greenhouse will be constructed of thin glass because this glazing does\nnot manipulate incoming radiation to the extent that other materials do (Giacomelli, 1999). The\nexperiment does not take the control to be the natural environment because there are factors\n\nsuch as predation, variation in nutrients and weather that might not be mimicked within the\nexperimental greenhouse. To learn about the effect of reduced direct radiation and increased\ndiffuse radiation we need to keep all the other factors constant.\nThe experimental greenhouse at each location will be composed of a double-layered\npolyethylene glaze. Transmittance () is defined as the ratio between radiation impinging on the\ngreenhouse covering (I0) and radiation within the greenhouse (I) (Giacomelli, 1993). That is,\n� ��\nExperimentation on double polyethylene glaze has measured its transmittance to be 80%\n(Giacomelli, 1999). A single layer of polyethylene results in 29% diffusion beneath the glaze\nwhile a double layer of polyethylene results in a 40% diffusion (Giacomelli, 1999).\nAnother factor to consider is the presence of structural support beams. Structural beams\ncan block incoming radiation of certain orientations and create excess shadows. An ideal\ngreenhouse would be one without bulky support beams and certain polyethylene greenhouse\ncoverings do not require structural support. To ensure similarity between the control and\nexperimental greenhouses the same structural supports will be used in both greenhouses.\nThe constructed greenhouses will be on the order of magnitude of the Eden project\ngreenhouses. A photo of the Eden project greenhouse domes is shown in figure 4. The size of\nthe Mediterranean biome of the Eden project has been chosen for replication in this experiment.\nThe proposed greenhouses will be 30 m high and cover an area of 6540 m2 (\"Mediterranean\nBiome\"). This large size will allow for a more accurate representation of the ecosystem in\nquestion than a smaller greenhouse could.\n\nFigure 4 The Eden Project in Cornwall, England. The Eden\nProject is a tourist attraction that features the largest\ngreenhouses in the world. Ecosystems from around the world\nare recreated in the biomes.

Therefore, to measure autotrophic productivity we will consider all of the new\nplant components, including new leaves, branches, seeds, roots, etc. (Clark, 2001).\nWithin the greenhouse random quadrats will be selected and the change in biomass will\nbe measured and recorded on a monthly basis. The monthly collection of data will include\nmeasuring the dry weight by clipping vegetation and also collecting the dead vegetation in the\ngiven quadrat (\"Estimation of NPP,\"). NPP will then be calculated using the equation of Weigert\nand Evans from 1964 (where r is the rate of decomposition):\nNPP = Biomass + Total Dead + r (Total Dead)\nThis experiment is intended to run continuously for several decades to quantify the long-term\nresponses of terrestrial autotrophs to sulfate aerosol manipulation. The specific duration of\nexperimentation will be dependent on the results of the experiment and whether the results\n\nseem worthy of continued study.\nExpected Results\nPast experiments and studies provide information that allows us to make conjectures\nabout the results of the proposed DRCG experiment. Many predictions of potential effects of\ninjecting sulfur into the stratosphere have relied on the proposed geoengineering scheme's\nsimilarity to volcanic eruptions. Lianhung Gu and colleagues have studied the effects of the\nMount Pinatubo eruption on Harvard forest (2003). Their experiment examined the effect that\nincreased diffuse radiation, brought about by volcanic eruption, had on Harvard forest's\nproductivity. As shown in figure 2, they found that both diffuse solar radiation and rates of\nGraphs of diffuse solar radiation and gross photosynthetic rate b\ny so\nlar\nelev\nati\non\nang\nle.\nFigure 2 Effects of the Mount Pinatubo eruption observed at Harvard Forest 2a)\nDiffuse Solar Radiation vs. Solar Elevation Angle 2b) Gross Photosynthetic Rate vs.\nSolar Elevation Angle. In the years following the 1991 eruption both diffuse radiation\nand the rate of photosynthesis increased (Adapted from Gu, 2003).\nInjection of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere by volcanic eruptions is an isolated and\ninfrequent occurrence. However, in order to mitigate global climate change the injection of sulfur\ninto the stratosphere would need to happen continuously for very long periods of time. While the\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nanalogy with volcanic eruption might hold at first we do not know if and by how much the effects\nwill deviate from the natural analog upon continuous implementation. We cannot expect all of\nour concerns and questions to be addressed by studies on volcanic eruptions that lack\ncontinuous implementation necessary to mitigate global climate change. Further\nexperimentation that examines the effects of continuous implementation, such as the proposed\nDRCG experiment, needs to be done in order to better understand the practicality of mitigating\nglobal climate change through stratospheric sulfur injection.\nThe expectation that stratospheric sulfur injection results in increased autotrophic\nproductivity is further supported by agricultural principles established by crop and forest\nscientists (Gu, 2003). It has been shown that plant canopies have higher photosynthetic\nefficiencies when using diffuse radiation as opposed to from direct radiation (Gu, 2003). Diffuse\nradiation reaches plants at many different angles and therefore allows a greater portion of the\nplant's surface to photosynthesize.\nMuch attention is often drawn to the negative unintended consequences of\ngeoengineering but I predict this experiment will reveal a positive one; that stratospheric sulfur\ninjection increases net primary productivity. If the experiment does find that alteration of\nincoming radiation fosters primary productivity we are actually increasing the ability of primary\nproducers to act as carbon sinks. Some geoengineering schemes focus solely on enhancing\nterrestrial autotrophs' carbon sink potential. Stratospheric sulfur injection may prove to be dually\neffective in that it creates a cooling effect by decreasing the direct radiation reaching the surface\nwhile it also increases terrestrial carbon sink potential and removes carbon dioxide from the\natmosphere.\nRecommendations and Concluding Discussion\nThe proposed DRCG experiment focuses on the terrestrial autotroph response to\n\nalteration of radiation brought about by the injection of sulfur into the stratosphere. The oceans\ncover 71% of the Earth's surface and it is therefore very important to investigate the aquatic\nresponse to radiation alteration due to stratospheric sulfur injection as well. The aquatic\ncomponent is out of the scope of the proposed DRCG experiment but it is something that should\nbe investigated to gain a better understanding of the implications of the worldwide\nimplementation of stratospheric sulfur injection.\nStratospheric sulfur injection and geoengineering schemes at large involve the\nmanipulation of the environment on a planetary scale. Yes, we can design experiments to\nenlighten our understanding of the implications of geoengineering schemes. We may find that\nsome experiments reveal positive unintended consequences while others reveal different\nnegative consequences. Yet, even if we do test the geoengineering scheme in every way that\nwe can fathom there will still remain unrealized and unpredictable side effects. We cannot\naccurately model our biosphere and all of its complex functions as of now so a complete\nunderstanding of geoengineering implications cannot be realized without physical\nimplementation.\nIntentionally manipulating the global environment may not be the best idea to mitigate\nclimate change. However, testing geoengineering schemes is important because as other\nefforts, such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions, continue to fall through geoengineering may\nbe something we are forced to rely on to save our planet. If this worst-case scenario were to\narise we would be much better prepared to cope with potential side effects if we had analyzed\nthem to the best of our ability. I have proposed the DRCG experiment for this very reason: to\nenlighten our understanding of the implications of geoengineering by stratospheric sulfur\ninjection.\n\nResources\nAucamp, P. J. (2007).

Your work will culminate in two\nproducts.\n1) You will write a 10-15 page research proposal. The proposal will be turned in and evaluated by\nthe technical and communication staff in five stages (see II Term Paper: Proposal for the due\ndates of each stage and for a detailed description of the requirements for each section of the\nproposal).\n2) You will also give a 5-minute presentation on your proposal at the end of the term (see IV Oral\nPresentation for details).\nAudience: Consider the audience for your proposal (paper and presentation) as a \"board\" that will\ndecide whether to fund your project for assessing a particular geoengineering technology. As in \"real\nlife,\" this board would consist of technical people (such as the course Profs, TAs, and your colleagues) as\nwell as non-technical people (such as project managers, philanthropic funders, venture capitalists, etc.).\nGrading: The paper and presentation together make up your term project, which is 40% of your grade\nfor the course (see V Grading for Term Project for details).\nInstruction: Instruction and help with your research, writing, content, experimental design,\npresentations, etc. will take place during regular course time and during Recitations (see Syllabus,\nparticularly for library sessions and for CI topics). For extra help, become familiar early on with the variety\nof resources available to you (see III Resources). Additional handouts will be distributed in class.\nWhat is Geoengineering?\nIt is now widely accepted that in the last 200 years humans have fundamentally changed the way the\nEarth system functions. We have changed the composition of our atmosphere and our oceans, and have\ntransformed the hydrology and biology of the terrestrial biosphere. These effects have not been by design\nbut are the result of cumulative, scaled-up consequences of human population growth.\nRecently, proposals have emerged to reverse the undesirable dimensions of these trends through large-\nscale engineering approaches. Potential technologies proposed to mitigate global-scale anthropogenic\neffects range from plans to increase the reflectivity of clouds to fertilizing the oceans to draw down CO2\nfrom the atmosphere. Geoengineering is not remediation. It is not waste management, but precisely\ndefining it can be difficult. Part of your challenge in this assignment is to define geoengineering in a\nrobust way. The consensus is that geoengineering is deliberate and large-scale (ultimately planetary\n\nscale) environmental engineering, aimed at counteracting undesired features of the Earth system, be they\nobviously induced by humans or not.\nBefore this type of manipulation of the Earth system could be implemented, however, the risks of potential\nunintended side effects must be assessed either experimentally or through combined experimentation\nand modeling. These potential side effects, not the geoengineering itself, are the subject of your term\nproject.\nTo get you started, here are some examples of geoengineering topics that would be appropriate to\nchoose for your project (for some, names are given to help you search for their proponents).\n- Use wave action or deep ocean pipes to pump cold water from the deep ocean to the surface (Kithil)\n- Spread chemical \"monolayers\" on the surface oceans to mitigate hurricanes (Emanuel)\n- Fertilize the oceans with iron to draw CO2 out of the atmosphere (Planktos; Climos; GreenSea Venture)\n- Make salty ice in the Arctic to keep the ocean conveyer belt going if it slows down (Flynn)\n- Grow \"Super Trees\" in factories (ArborGen) and plant them globally using aerial planting\n- Use artificial wetlands on a large scale, specifically and deliberately (Kania)\n- Place lenses in space to bend sunlight away from the Earth\n- Cover the oceans with white plastic disks to reflect sunlight back into space\n- Cover the deserts with white plastic mulch to reflect sunlight back into space\n- Have ships spray mists of saltwater into the air to increase the amount and reflectivity of clouds\n- Put sulfur aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from the earth\n- Dam the Straits of Gibraltar in order to prevent the more saline water from the Mediterranean Sea from\naffecting the North Atlantic conveyor circulation\n- \"Terraform\" another planet (likely Mars) to make more room for humans\n- Use space sunshields to reflect solar radiation\n- Reduce the global human population\n- Protect or thicken sea ice\n- Paint the roofs of all buildings white (Chu)\n- Green large tracts of desert\n- Genetically engineer more reflective crops or trees\nIf you prefer, you may design your own geoengineering technology, but it must be well thought out and\nargued. It must be a manipulation of the Earth system and must have both large scale and intent. It must\nalso make scientific sense; it cannot be pure science fiction.\nII\nTerm Paper: Proposal\nThe Term Paper consists of a series of five assignments, which will be completed in stages over the\ncourse of the semester.\nKey Dates for the Term Paper\n1) Topic Submission.....................\nDue September 17\n2) Project Description...................\nDue October 1\n3) Introduction.............................\nDue October 20\n4) Experimental Design/Proposal....\nDue November 3\n5) Complete Final Paper................\nDue December 1\nProcess for Handing in Paper sections\nAs each section will be evaluated and receive feedback from both the technical staff (Profs and TAs) and\nfrom the CI staff, we will need multiple copies of each submission. To accommodate the preferences and\nlogistics of different readers (some like hard copy, some electronic, etc.), please hand in your work as\nfollows.\n-\nSubmit two hard copies of each assignment\n-\nSubmit a copy in both Word and PDF\n\nFormat\n-\nPlease format text as double-spaced, in Arial 11 pt, with 1\" margins.\n-\nPlease number your pages and make sure that your name is on each assignment.\n-\nUse APA format for in-text citations and for your Bibliography.\nInstruction on section formatting, such as the use of headings and the integration of graphics, will be\ngiven during CI lectures.\nInstructions for Term Paper Sections\nGeneral Note: Remember that your paper is being graded both for its technical content and ability to communicate\nscientific material effectively. Word and page lengths listed are general suggestions. You will not be explicitly\npenalized for writing more or less than this amount, but if you write less, you may not be sufficiently fulfilling the\nassignment and will be graded accordingly. If you write too much, you may be sacrificing communication skills.\nThese choices are at your discretion. If you write effectively, persuasively, and succinctly, you will get a good grade!\n1) Topic Submission: You must submit a three to five sentence description of the geoengineering\nidea you would like to study for your Term Paper. This must be submitted on September 17, 2009. It is\nnot graded but must be submitted. In your three to five sentences, please describe the basic\ngeoengineering strategy. For example, if you are choosing Ocean Iron Fertilization, explain how it\naddresses global warming. Please note, if you are choosing a topic not on the list in the assignment, it is\na good idea to pass your idea by one of the professors or TAs before submission, to make sure that the\nidea makes sense. If you submit an idea that does not constitute a true geoengineering idea in the\nopinion of the professors or TAs, you may be asked to change your topic and resubmit another one.\nAlthough this assignment is not graded, topic submission is required. Although changing your topic after\nsubmission is possible, the longer you delay in settling on a topic, the more behind you will be on your\nproject.\n2) Project Description with References: Be sure to outline the geoengineering idea you've chosen\nand the groundwork for the experiment you propose doing to test the unintended consequences of that\ngeoengineering idea. The Project Description should provide an overview of the sections you intend to\ninclude in your paper or proposal and contain sufficient content for the people reading it to fully grasp\nwhat you plan to do. It should not be a list of bullets (for style, see the Project Description handout). The\npurpose is for you to demonstrate that you've started your literature searches on the geoengineering topic\nyou've selected and that you've started thinking about ways to test the unintended consequences of this\ngeoengineering idea. To this end, your project description should lay the groundwork for both the\nIntroduction and Experimental Design sections of your paper. You are not bound by your specific design\nhere, but the overview gives you an opportunity to put forth ideas and get feedback on them. In your\nProject Description, you should demonstrate knowledge of how the geoengineering topic you've selected\nis meant to work, what some of the potential problems with its implementation might be, and how you\nmight go about measuring or testing those problems.\nYour Project Description should be 750-1000 words and must be accompanied by at least five references\nthat are cited in your outline. The references must come from peer-reviewed journals. The Project\nDescription is due on October 1, 2009 and is worth 10% of your Term Paper grade.\n3) Introduction: This is the introduction to your paper and should show the full scale of research you've\ndone on this topic. Your Introduction should consist of three parts.\nIn the first part of the Introduction, confine the discussion to the issues and attributes of the problem\naddressed by the topic you've selected. Identify the problem's implications ecologically and socially, etc.\nProvide a foundation for your understanding of the problem through a thorough literature search. For\nmany students, this \"problem\" will be global climate change, but there may be other possibilities. Each of\nthese parts should contain a coherent review of the relevant literature in the field.\n\nIn the second part of the Introduction, you should review the origins and history of the concept of\ngeoengineering, and summarize a broad suite of proposed schemes that you have discovered in your\nreadings. You might organize this review by \"types\" of geoengineering strategies (i.e. sun-blocking\nstrategies vs. carbon dioxide reduction strategies) or as a list of individual strategies. You should use\nfigures to illustrate your points, either drawn from the literature (properly cited) or sketched yourself.\nPlease demonstrate themes, problems, negative side effects, or other ideas common to these various\nstrategies.\nIn the third part of the Introduction, you should provide an in-depth analysis of the particular\ngeoengineering topic that you've selected. You should discuss how it is supposed to work, providing\ntechnical details and diagrams if appropriate. You should use citations from relevant literature to provide\nthe necessary details on your project. You should describe the intended consequences of your\ngeoengineering topic. What is it supposed to do and why? Please do not hesitate to explore aspects of\nthe topic that go beyond the basic literature.\nYour Introduction should be around 1000-1500 words (double-spaced, 11 pt Arial font, 1\" margins). It\nmust be accompanied by at least one or two graphics (figures, tables, or both) and ten peer-reviewed\nreferences. Your Introduction is due on October 20, 2009 and is worth 25% of your Term Paper grade.\n4) Experimental Design/Proposal: This is the experiment you are proposing to be funded. It should\nbe a detailed experiment designed to test the unintended consequences of the geoengineering strategy\nyou've introduced in your Introduction. Your Experimental Design should consist of three parts:\nIn the first part of the Experimental Design, you should review the potential unintended consequences of\nimplementing the geoengineering idea introduced in your Introduction. Explain what might go wrong, how\nit might negatively affect the Earth system, etc. This is a literature review and should be cited\naccordingly.\nIn the second part of the Experimental Design, you should propose a hypothesis regarding the testing of\none or more unintended consequences. You are designing an experiment to test whether these potential\nunintended consequences will actually occur or not. Your hypothesis should be detailed and reflect your\nprediction of what your experiment will determine. It should specifically address the likelihood and\nseverity of the unintended consequence or consequences that you are testing. You should base your\nhypothesis on a solid foundation in the scientific literature. We understand that you are not actually\nperforming this experiment, but you should be able to propose an educated hypothesis based on your\nresearch.\nIn the third part of the Experimental Design, you should propose the actual experimental design that\nyou've developed to test the hypothesis you've put forward regarding the unintended consequences of\nyour geoengineering topic. You should include technical details, diagrams, and experimental details\n(replicates, controls, etc.). This is your chance to demonstrate both your knowledge of the Earth system\nand your knowledge and creativity in experimental design. This is the experiment you are proposing and\nwhose funding you will have to argue for in your presentation. Your design must be scientifically\nreasonable, and this will require literature reviews.\nYour Experimental Design should be around 1000-1500 words (double-spaced, 11 pt Arial font, 1\"\nmargins). It must be accompanied by at least one or two graphics and ten peer-reviewed references.\nYour Experimental Design is due on November 3, 2009 and is worth 25% of your Term Paper grade.\n5) Complete Final Paper: This is the final product, your complete Term Paper. It should include the\nsix sections detailed below.\nTitle Page: Your Final Paper should have a cover page with your name, date, and the title of your paper.\nThe title should be descriptive of both the geoengineering topic you've worked on and the experiment\nyou've proposed to test its unintended consequences.\nExecutive Summary: Your Final Paper should start with a 250-500 word summary of the entire paper.\nYou should use this as an opportunity to explain why the experiment you've proposed is important.\n\nJustify it by summarizing the problem, geoengineering idea, and potential problems with this idea. You\nshould also describe what you expect to find with your experiment.\nIntroduction: Your Final Paper should include a revised version of the Introduction that you submitted\nearlier in the course. Be sure to pay close attention to the editorial comments of your graders and to\ntransitions between your sections!\nExperimental Design Proposal: Your Final Paper should include a revised version of the Experimental\nDesign that you submitted earlier in the course. Be sure to pay close attention to the editorial comments\nof your graders and to transitions between your sections!\nConclusions and Recommendations: Your Final Paper should conclude with a 500-1000 word section\nthat highlights the predicted results of your experiment and what these results might mean for your\nopinion regarding implementation of this and of other geoengineering strategies. This is a chance for you\nto put your experiment in the context of dealing with global problems as a whole. You should write your\nown recommendations based on your research.\nBibliography: You should have at least 15 peer-reviewed references written in APA format (see CI\ninstructors for formatting details).\nYour complete Final Term Paper should be around 2750-4500 words (double-spaced, 11 pt Arial font,\n1\" margins), excluding front matter, references, figures and tables.

The Undergraduate\nTeaching Fellows are also a valuable resource, having already been through this experience.\n-\nFor guidance with questions about writing, style, research paper formats, working with figures,\netc., make an appointment with one of the course CI Lecturers, Harlan, Leslie, or Mary. Early\non, you will be assigned to a particular CI Lecturer who will follow you throughout your project.\n-\nFor guidance on research, contact Anne Graham or Chris Sherrat, the Course 1 librarians. Do\nmake use of the 1.018 library page.\n-\nFor general guidance on writing and researching your proposal, consult the online version of The\nMayfield Handbook for Technical and Scientific Writing:\nhttp://www.mhhe.com/mayfieldpub/tsw/home.htm\n-\nThe MIT Writing Center, at: http://humanistic.mit.edu/wcc has a great many helpful links.\nMost Common Errors of Proposals in the Past\nGood writers, scientists, and engineers learn from the successes and the mistakes of those in their field.\nSo, just as you might look to exemplary forms of bridges when designing your own structure, you should\nlook to exemplary forms of the type of document you will be producing for ideas on handling form and\ncontent. Understanding mistakes can be of equal importance. 1.018 Proposal evaluators have noted the\nfollowing as the most common errors in the past. Duplicating these errors in your Proposal, without a\nclear rationale, may call your professionalism into question.\n-\nUsing quotations when they are unnecessary. Scientific writing rarely uses quotations.\nParaphrase when at all possible. Quote only when there is a sentence that is so eloquent that it\ncan only be captured with the exact language of the original author.\n-\nNot using any subheadings. Your text will be much more readable if you use subheadings under\nthe major headings for your paper. How many you use is up to you, but usually subheadings are\nused every few paragraphs.\n-\nUsing too many subheadings. You should have more than one paragraph under a subheading.\n\n-\nMeaningless headings. Headings should have topical content. Not \"Review of Literature,\" for\nexample, but \"Wetland Restoration Examples.\" The best headings are summary statements\nrather than questions, not too brief (e.g. 'Inspection of Contaminated Site' is more explicit than\n'Results'), not judgmental (e.g. 'Equipment for Review' is more neutral than 'Poor Equipment'),\nnot too long (e.g. 'The Equipment on the Whyalla Factory Floor' is unhelpfully long).\n-\nNot integrating material from various sources into a single, unified argument. This is the most\ndifficult part of writing. You should try to use multiple sources in a given paragraph, integrating\nthe ideas and results from different studies. If you are having trouble with this, get help.\n-\nNot clearly stating the question you are trying to address. This should be done very explicitly and\nput in bold in the text.\n-\nNot clearly stating how an experimental design will address the question. This problem can\nusually be aided by showing hypothetical results.\n-\nUsing vague terms. For example: \"pollution,\" \"water quality,\" \"ecosystem,\" \"health.\"\n-\nUsing an improper style for references. See guidelines that will be handed out.\n-\nNot using enough primary references. Consult with us if you don't know what a primary reference\nis.\n-\nNot adapting figure captions for your own purposes. Don't just copy them from your source, write\nyour own figure captions.\n-\nNo figure captions. These are very important! One should be able to look at a figure and caption\nand know what it is all about.\n-\nNot citing the sources of your graphics (figures and tables). This is plagiarism. For more on\nciting, see The Mayfield Handbook and/or Academic Integrity at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, http://web.mit.edu/academicintegrity/handbook/handbook.pdf.\n-\nNot enough graphics. It is helpful to have 3-4 graphics in your paper.\n-\nMessy or unclear figures (Hand-done is fine, but make them neat and clean). Think about your\nfinal oral presentation when you are drafting the figures.\nOther suggestions\n-\nDiagram technology and experimental designs, showing replicates and controls.\n-\nSometimes the use of \"Boxes\" to cover particular topics in depth can be effective. Just like\ntextbooks.\n-\nPut questions or hypotheses in bold or as bullet points. Make them clear and obvious.\nCitation Guidelines in short\n-\nCite only those references you refer to in the text.\n-\nDo not use footnotes for citing articles (they can be used for other reasons).\n-\nYour list of references should appear at the end of the paper.\n-\nUse APA format, http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/\nExamples of citation style in text:\n-\n\"Climate limits the geographic distribution of species (Jones, 1975)...\" or \"According to Jones\n(1975), climate limits the...\"\n-\nIf you are writing about information that is discussed in another paper and you can't find the\noriginal article, say: \"According to Jones (1975, as cited in Smith 1980)...\"\nExamples of form to be used in reference list:\nBook\nAndrewartha, H.G. and L.C.

You may want to \"use\" these sites as part of your research\nproposal. In addition, many whole ecosystem experiments have been performed in the past 50 years or\nso, which may give you ideas about how to design your pilot geoengineering project. Information on these\nis summarized below.\nLong-term Ecological Research (LTER) and Microbial Observatory sites\nCurrent LTER sites can be found at LTER: http://www.lternet.edu/sites/. They are not only in the U.S. and\nAntarctica, and are being established internationally (ILTER sites) in countries such as Brazil, Canada,\nHungary, Costa Rica, and Israel. Together, these sites represent many of the different ecological\ncommunities found throughout the world and offer significant opportunities to scientists wishing to plug\ntheir research into a larger network of data and information. By going to the website given above and the\nlinks shown there, you can see what LTER sites are all about and the types of research projects that are\nbeing conducted there. If you select an LTER site, you should include a description of ongoing research\nat that site, why that site is appropriate for your proposed research, and how your work will differ from\nexisting research.\nIn addition, a new NSF program in Microbial Observatories has recently been established. Links to some\nof these sites and some of the questions being addressed can be found at:\nhttp://www.microbes.info/resources/General_Microbiology/Observatories/index.html\nIV Oral Presentations\nAssignment: At the end of the semester, students will give in-class presentations on their term projects.\nYour assignment is to give a five-minute presentation (most students use PowerPoint, but this is not\nrequired) to \"sell\" your proposed experiment to a fictional grant-funding agency (the students, professors,\nand TAs who are grading you). You need to try to convince them of the following.\nWhy it is important to test geoengineering strategies and why your particular proposed experiment is a\ngood way to test the potential unintended consequence of the geoengineering strategy you've selected.\nYou should help bolster your argument by using graphics (figures, diagrams, and tables) and text. After\nyour five minutes are up, you will have two minutes to field questions from the rest of the class, the\nprofessors, and the TAs. You will be graded based on the effectiveness of your scientific arguments and\nyour presentation style.\nLogistic Details\nPresentations will take place during the last two weeks of the course. They will take place in both\nrecitation sections and normal class lectures. Attendance is mandatory and will be taken. There will be a\nsign-up for presentation time slots several weeks before the presentations.\nYour presentation slides, if you are using them, will be due by 5 pm the day before you're scheduled to\npresent. All presentations should be emailed to the TAs in PDF FORMAT so as to minimize Mac/PC\ntechnical difficulties.\nHelpful notes from previous years of presentations\n- DO NOT read from a script, as this is unprofessional and will not help your presentation grade.\n- DO practice your presentation beforehand, as timing is important. Undergraduate Teaching\nFellows and TAs are a helpful resource for giving feedback on your presentations. You only have\nfive minutes, and it goes by quickly! You will not be given extra time and will be cut off if you run\nover time\n\n- Remember, you are trying to convince people that the particular experiment you are proposing is\nworth funding. Tell us why your experiment to test the unintended consequences of this particular\ngeoengineering strategy is worthwhile.\n- Please DO ask questions of your fellow students!\nNote: Your presentation is worth 15% of your overall Term Project grade\nV\nGrading for the Term Project\nTerm Project Breakdown\nYour Term Project is worth 40% of your overall grade for the course. Your Term Project is graded as\nfollows.\n- Term Paper: 85%\n- Presentation: 15%\nYour Term Paper is graded as follows.\n- Project Description:\n10% (Due October 1)\n- Introduction:\n25% (Due October 20)\n- Experimental Design/Proposal: 25% (Due November 3)\n- Complete Final Paper\n40% (Due December 1)\nGrading for Sections\nIn order to give you appropriate feedback, your Outline, Introduction, and Experimental Design will be\ngraded by both a technical grader (professor or TA) and by a CI grader (CI lecturer). The grades for\nthese three sections will be broken down as follows.\n50% technical grade for science content\n50% CI grade for communications skills\nIn other words, for each of these three sections, your grade will be the average of your technical grade\n(for science content) and your CI grade (for communications skills).\nGrading for the Final Paper\nYour final complete Term Paper will be graded by both a technical grader and a CI grader. The grades\nfor this paper will be broken down as follows.\n70% technical grade for science content\n30% CI grade for communications skills\nNote: For this paper you will be graded on both your new content (Executive Summary and Conclusions) AND on the\nrevisions of your previous sections as well as your ability to transition between sections in the complete paper.\nExtensions and Late Papers\nAs a class-wide policy, extensions are only granted for unpredictable circumstances. This does not\ninclude juggling intense academic schedules that require foresight and planning, but does include sudden\nillness, computer disasters, etc. In all cases, please contact a TA or professor as early as possible. You\nwill be asked to provide documentation when appropriate. The time-frame of the extension will be context\ndependent.\nThere should be no late papers. If you cannot make the deadline and don't have a valid excuse (i.e. an\nunpredictable circumstance), it is better to turn the assignment in late than not at all. It will be penalized\n5% of your grade PER DAY (where day = 24 hours). Because of the tight-turnaround in grading and\ncommenting throughout the semester, papers will only be accepted a maximum of 3 days (72h) late!\nThis means if the paper is due Friday at 5pm, late papers will only be accepted until Monday at 5pm. After\nthis point, you will receive a 0 for that assignment. The late penalties will be assigned to each late section\n\nindividually, and the penalty will be deducted from the grade for that section only. You are STRONGLY\nencouraged to always turn in your work on time.\nYour Presentations will be graded as follows.\n70% technical grade (average of TA/professor grades on a 20-point scale)\n30% CI grade for communications skills\nYour technical grade here will reflect the degree to which the \"board\" composed of the TAs and\nprofessors feels that your project, as you've presented it, should be funded. Obviously this will include\nboth the science and how you present that science. Your CI grade will be on your communications skills\n(slide design, pace of reading, timing, eye contact, etc).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.018J / 7.30J Ecology I: The Earth\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Testing the Unintended Consequences of\nLignin Reduction in Genetically Modified Trees\non Trophic Interactions\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nDecember 1st, 2009\n\nExecutive Summary:\nGenetically modified trees with reduced lignin composition have been proposed as a\ngeoengineering scheme that could potentially reduce environmental impact from chemically\nharsh pulping practices within the paper industry. Lignin is the complex chemical compound that\ngives trees their protection against climate, disease, and animal activity. However, the presence\nof lignin in wood demands the use of toxic chemicals in pulping and paper mills, which\nconstitute sa health hazard to mill workers as well as the natural environment. Decreasing the\namounts of lignin in trees raised specifically for the paper industry should result in increased\nproductivity in paper-making and lessen the need for harsh chemicals. Although lignin reduction\nis a potential method to maximize efficiency and minimize the environmental footprint of the\npaper industry, it may have unintended consequences upon the environment. Potential side\neffects associated with lignin reduction include decreased fitness of the transformed trees,\ntransgene escape, and changes in herbivorous insect populations. These are significant\nbecause they may endanger the wellbeing of other species and the entire ecosystem.\nThe proposed experiment calls for a long-term field trial that will study and quantify the\neffect of lignin reduction on trophic interactions in the surrounding environment. Specifically, the\nfield trial will genetically transform Populus tremuloides, or trembling aspen, a species that is\ncommonly used for papermaking, and observe the populations of associated insect herbivores\nand non-herbivores. The anticipated results of this field trial are that there will be little to no\neffect on trophic interactions. Although the experiment will not capture the impact of lignin\nreduction on an entire ecosystem, the results of the field trial should deepen our understanding\nof how the effects of such a genetic modification permeate through different trophic levels.\n\nLignin and Toxic Pulping Waste\nEver since the Chinese developed the first papermaking process in the 2nd century CE,\npaper has been one of the largest and most widespread commodities across the globe. The\neventual mechanized production of paper through the printing press in the early 19th century\ndrove up the demand for newsprint and books since paper became relatively cheap and easy to\nproduce. The increase in international demand for paper has consequently led to the chemical\npollution of aquatic environments by paper mills as well as deforestation.\nBefore wood is made into paper, it undergoes the pulping process. The breakdown of\nlignin, the complex chemical compound that gives trees their protection against climate,\npathogens, and other pests, often requires harsh chemicals. Use of these chemicals results in\npotential runoff from paper mills that may accumulate in the surrounding environment and have\ndetrimental effects upon the ecosystem and its inhabitants (Sponza, 2003). Runoff from paper\nmills located near bodies of water contaminates the marine environment, thus negatively\nimpacting resident species. Studies have shown that fish populations exposed to the effluents of\nthe pulp and paper making processes experience a decline in their rate of reproduction.\nDevelopment of eggs was depressed and the lifespan of the fish decreased. A male-biased sex\nratio was observed as well in the fish population (Larsson and Forlin, 2002). Lastly, the\naccretion of toxic and mutagenic chemicals in the lakes proved harmful to microorganisms and\nphytoplankton, resulting in the disruption of the natural food chain (Munkittrick et al., 1997;\nSibley et al., 1997; Soiamasuo et al., 1998).\nNot only do pulping chemicals prove dangerous to the natural environment, they pose a\nserious health risk to paper mill workers. Working directly with these chemicals for extended\nperiods of time leads to long term diseases. Various studies performed on the well-being of mill\nworkers revealed a direct correlation between the toxicity of the pulping process and the\nworkers' poor health (Lee et al., 2002). In all cases, the observed number of deaths was greater\n\nthan the expected number in a range of illnesses, including diabetes, mental disorders, and\nvarious forms of cancer (See Table 1). These results reveal that the amount of dangerous\nchemicals used in the paper industry must be reduced in order to preserve our environment and\nminimize health risks to humans.\nTable 1. Observed and expected deaths of paper mill workers in New Hampshire.\nCause of Death\nObserved\nExpected\nCancer of buccal cavity & pharynx\nCancer of digestive organs\nCancer of stomach\nCancer of rectum\nCancer of larynx\nLeukemia and aleukemia\nDiabetes mellitus\nMental and psychoneurotic disorders\nThe observed number of deaths exceeds the expected number in a variety of diseases\nmill workers developed from working in close proximity to pulping chemicals. Adapted\nfrom Schwartz (1988).\nBrief Overview of Geoengineering\nThe growing awareness of human impact upon the natural environment has led to\ninnovation in solutions for our environmental woes. While some have proposed simply scaling\nback polluting activities, human ingenuity has also suggested geoengineering as a viable\nscheme. The concept of geoengineering entails the large-scale manipulation of the environment\nin order to combat or counteract the negative effects of human activity. Although the concept of\ngeoengineering was first explored with political intent in the context of the Cold War, emerging\nenvironmental concerns in the subsequent decade brought about its examination as a legitimate\nmeans of resolving environmental problems (Keith, 2000). Two key parameters that guide the\nuse of geoengineering are scale, which must be global, and intent, where environmental change\nmust be the main goal. For example, mowing grass reflects intent without scale because while\n\nsuiting human desires, it does not actually impact the environment on a global level. On the\nother hand, the previous manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) is an example of scale\nwithout intent since the depletion of the ozone layer was an unintended side effect.\nGeoengineering seeks to reconcile scale and intent. It is important to note that while most\ngeoengineering schemes focus on counteracting the effects of increased anthropogenic gases\nin the atmosphere, geoengineering is still applicable to other environmental issues.\nThe focus on geoengineering has produced many proposals varying in concept and\nexecution. Most geoengineering schemes can be grouped according to intent, as in whether\nthey aim to regulate energy balance, the net thermal energy input, or energy transport, the\ndistribution of the energy in the climate system (See Figure 1).\nAn example of a geoengineering scheme that targets reduction of atmospheric carbon\ndioxide, hence energy balance, is iron fertilization of the oceans. The concept behind iron\nfertilization is intentionally introducing iron to the ocean, thus encouraging growth of\nphytoplankton blooms. Because iron is a limiting factor for phytoplankton in the open ocean, its\naddition greatly enhances the oceanic carbon sink. Net primary productivity of the oceans\nshould increase and sequester greater amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Iron\nfertilization has worked well in terms of enhancing carbon uptake of the oceans both in lab\nmodels and small test patches in the Atlantic (Boyd et al., 2000; Buesseler et al., 2004).\nHowever, if iron fertilization of aquatic environments were to cease after being implemented on\na long-term basis, the phytoplankton communities would collapse. In other words, the trophic\npyramid in the ocean would \"bottom out\", the repercussions of which are disastrous. Further\nresearch is necessary in order to gain a more thorough understanding of how iron fertilization\ninfluences the benthic food web. In addition, there is no conclusive evidence that iron\nfertilization has a sustained impact upon carbon concentrations in the atmosphere (Bala, 2009;\nCooper et al., 1996).\n\nAs aforementioned, not all geoengineering schemes aim to counteract global warming.\nSome are developed as means of manipulating energy transport, such as spreading chemical\nmonolayers on the ocean surface to mitigate hurricanes. In this weather and climate control\nscheme, a thin film of biodegradable chemicals is spread over the oceans in order to prevent\nevaporation of water into the air. Because hurricanes form due to heat energy transferred\nthrough evaporation, scientists believe that this may lessen the number of annual hurricanes\nand the destruction of cities and coastlines (Mallinger and Mickelson, 1973). Drawbacks of\nchemical monolayers include unknown ecological effects upon the marine biome and the film's\nability to resist displacement by hurricane-force winds and other inclement weather. Though\nresearch has been conducted in reservoirs, it is difficult to assume that chemical monolayers will\nbe viable across the open ocean.\nAlthough most geoengineering projects can be classified in the taxonomy shown in\nFigure 1, geoengineering is a pertinent solution to other types of environmental problems that\ndo not involve energy manipulation. The topic of this proposal, which is the application of\ngenetic engineering in trees to reduce chemical pollution of aquatic environments located near\npulping mills, is an example of such a scheme.\nGeoengineering Strategies\nEnergy Balance\nOcean fertilization\nTerrestrial ecosystem carbon capture\nGeochemical sequestration\nEcosystem productivity by genetic modification\nEnergy Transport\nChemical or physical control of evaporation\nHydrological engineering\nWeather control\nIceberg transport\nFigure 1. Taxonomy separating geoengineering schemes targeted towards reducing\ngreenhouse gases into the categories of energy balance and energy transport. Adapted\nfrom Keith (2000).\n\nHistory and Application of Genetically Engineered Trees\nThis proposal aims to examine the concept and global application of genetically\nengineered trees to the paper industry, specifically in lignin reduction. Unlike other\ngeoengineering schemes, transgenic trees are not developed for only one specific means.\nInstead, the scheme has potential in a diverse set of applications due to the wide variety of\nmodifiable traits in trees. These can be grouped under three general themes, which are\nsilviculture, adaptability, and wood quality traits (See Table 2). Silviculture refers to traits that\naffect growth, health, and quality of a tree; adaptability encompasses a tree's ability to tolerate\ncertain environmental stresses, like a cold climate; wood quality traits includes characteristics of\nthe tree which affect how easily it can be made into paper.\nCurrently, 225 field trials of genetically modified trees exist across 16 countries, all in\nvarious stages of research and development. In the United Kingdom and France, long-term field\ntrials have been conducted on the quality of pulp produced by transgenic poplars. Brazil has\nalso instituted large-scale experiments on modified Eucalyptus in order to preserve its natural\nforests (Sedjo, 2004; Snow et al., 2005). Testing of trees in the United States makes up the\nmajority of global field trials with a diverse set of applications, from pulping to restoration of\nAmerican tree species. Although most countries have kept genetically engineered trees in the\nresearch and development stage, China has moved into commercial development of transgenic\ntrees and has planted over one million trees throughout the nation.\nGenetically modifying trees is particularly useful in the restoration of endangered\nspecies. The American elm (Ulmus americana L.) was once commonly found in northeastern\nUnited States and southeastern Canada and used in lining city streets. Unfortunately, the tree\npopulation was decimated by the fungal Dutch-elm disease in the 1930s. While remediation\nefforts and pesticides targeted at the host insect have been implemented, there has been much\ninterest in producing a disease-resistant tree through genetic engineering. Recent research has\n\nshown that the American elm may be making a comeback as DNA-transformed young saplings\nwith mycorrhizal resistance are released into the wild (Newhouse et al., 2007). A similar\nconclusion can be drawn for the European and American chestnut population, both of which\nwere ravaged by ink disease and chestnut blight (Adams et al., 2002; Andrade and Merkle,\n2005; Corredoira et al., 2008). Improving the adaptability of a species by imbuing plant cells with\nselected genotypes like antifungal or antimicrobial genes will have large implications upon the\nspecies of trees that will populate the Earth in the coming years.\nWhereas the use of transgenic trees to bring back endangered species is useful on a\nregional scale, genetically modified trees are applicable on a global scale in the paper industry.\nAs global demand for timber and timber products grows at an annual rate of 1.7% from 5-7\nbillion m3 of forest, lignin engineering must be examined as a viable option to decrease the\nchemical pollution of paper mills (Szabo, 2009; Walter, 2004). Transgenic trees with a lower\nlignin content can be achieved through genetic engineering. Several studies have been\nperformed on the lignin biosynthesis pathway, leading to the transformation of the genes\nencoding enzymes involved in the creation of lignin within the plant as well as the use of RNA\ninterference to \"silence\" gene expression (Baucher et al., 2003; Li et al., 2008).\nResults on the pulping of wood with modified lignin content in the laboratory have proven\nthat genetic alterations have a profound impact on pulping quality and efficiency. Some\nalterations work better than others in terms of increasing pulp output and decreasing chemical\nconsumption. Research conducted on tobacco with modified lignin concentrations found that\nmore lignin could be removed through alkali extraction without sacrificing paper pulp quality\n(O'Connell et al., 2002). In fact, the pulp was comparable to that produced from wild-type\ntobacco. Similar results were found for transgenic poplars (Pilates et al., 2002). A closer\nexamination of the structure and biosynthesis of lignin as well as general pulping practices\n\nshould yield a better understanding of the breakdown of the compound.\nTable 2. Traits of Interest in Genetically Modified Trees\nSilviculture\nAdaptability\nWood Quality Traits\nGrowth rate\nDrought tolerance\nWood density\nNutrient uptake\nCold tolerance\nLignin reduction\nFlowering control\nFungal resistance\nLignin extraction\nHerbicide tolerance\nInsect resistance\nFiber quality\nCommonly modified traits in transgenic trees grouped according to purpose (Sedjo, 2004.)\nLignin and Specific Pulping Processes\nLignin is one of the most abundant biopolymers in the world. As a major component of\nwood cell walls, its purpose is to protect the insides of the tree from outside damage. Because\nof its toughness, it also represents a major obstacle to pulping, forage digestibility, and biofuel\nproduction. The lignin polymer is characterized by ether and carbon-carbon bonds, which are\nextremely resistant to chemical degradation. Alterations in the lignin synthesis pathway can lead\nto a modified form that is much more susceptible to breakage. For example, suppression of the\nfinal step in the pathway, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), results in lignin that is much\nmore easily extracted, thus improving pulping efficiency (Baucher et al., 2003).\nPulping is the process by which lignin is removed from raw wood, thus producing wood\npulp. The two primary pulping methods are mechanical and chemical. In 2000, world pulp\nproduction surpassed 185 million metric tons, 70% of which was derived from chemical pulping\n(Pilates et al., 2002). Because most of the pulp, and subsequently paper, is produced by\nchemical means, the main focus will be on improving the yield of current chemical practices.\nThe type of paper product determines what kind of pulping process is used. The Kraft\nprocess is the most popular method, using sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide to remove\nlignin. Sulfur reacts with the lignin to form thiolignins, which are more easily removed. Because\nlignin and other cellulose fibers are removed, the yield is around 45-55% of the original\n\nbiomass. The amount of residual lignin determines the Kappa number, which indicates the\nbleachability of wood pulp. Therefore, a lower Kappa number is desirable for trees raised\nspecifically for the papermaking industry. Another approach is bleaching, most used for the\nproduction of high-quality paper, such as printer paper and card stock. In order to produce paper\nthat is bright, the pulp must be bleached with chlorine dioxide, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen\nperoxide. Because the purpose of bleaching is to remove residual lignin, the lower the lignin\ncontent, the brighter the pulp will be. Sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide are extremely\nbasic in nature while chlorine dioxide is a very strong acid.\nAccrued runoff of either sodium hydroxide or bleach could lead to a drastic change in pH\nin lake and pond ecosystems that would exterminate life. Neutralization and dilution of these\nchemicals also exude dangerous fumes that are hazardous to the health of mill workers.\nTherefore, lignin reduction is desirable in the respect that there will be less chemical and energy\nexpenditure as well as improved environmental well-being.\nUnintended Consequuences of Reduced Lignin Composition\nAlthough there are many economic and health benefits to humans from reduced lignin\ncontent in trees, there are some serious ecological risks associated with genetically engineered\ntrees. If transgenic trees are to be implemented worldwide, they must be able to withstand\ndiversity in growing conditions and not cause inadvertent harm to the surrounding environment.\nThe effects of reduced lignin content upon the biotic and abiotic components of an\necosystem demand attention. Trees often play host to a number of fungal, microbial, and insect\ncommunities. Figure 3 shows an array of interactions trees have with the environment. Insect\nlarvae that feed on tree leaves may react positively to changes in lignin composition. Lowering\nlignin content would increase the digestability of leaves, thus providing the possibility that lignin\nreduction in transgenic trees would impact feeding patterns and population growth rates of leaf\ndefoliators (James et al., 1997). However, it is impossible to generalize that this is true for all\n\ninsect species, some of which may be more selective than others regarding diet.\nOn the other hand, transgenes may inadvertently harm the trees themselves, whether\ndirectly or indirectly. For example, because lignin safeguard trees against the elements, it\nfollows that the transgenic trees would be less fit in their environment since they cannot protect\nthemselves from cold climate and pests (Pedersen et al., 2005). Tests carried out with\ntransgenic silver birch where fungal resistance was added revealed unexpectedly that the\nmodified trees suffered more leaf damage due to increased aphid population even though the\nexpression of the transgene successfully warded off fungal infections (Vihervuori et al., 2008).\nBecause the insertion of transgenes may result in unintended consequences on other aspects\nof tree health, future studies must direct their focus towards minimizing such effects.\nLignin alteration can also influence the rate of soil carbon formation. Comparisons\nbetween low-lignin and wildtype trees show that lower lignin content decreases the plant's ability\nto form roots and create new soil carbon (Hancock et al. 2006). In contrast, other studies show\nthis is not true across different species and soil types (Bradley et al., 2007). For example, while\nlignin modification in poplars did not show any significant effects on three different types of soil,\ntobacco with reduced lignin negatively impacted the fungal community in clay soil. Therefore,\nbefore genetically modified trees are released into commercial development, they must be\ntested with a variety of soils to ensure compatibility.\nIn addition, there is the possibility of transgene \"escape\". The decomposition of\ntransgenic trees makes the altered DNA available for incorporation into bacteria living in the\nground. Rapid reproduction rate could lead to a large amount of bacteria with the modified\ngenes in the natural environment, the consequences of which are unknown. Studies performed\non the persistence of DNA in decomposing leaves show that while initial degradation of the DNA\noccurs rapidly, fragments can remain in the soil for up to four months (Hay et al., 2002).\nBecause the lifetime of a tree can last many decades to over a century, it is difficult to\n\nobserve and evaluate through field trials all the possible risks. Therefore, any application of\nlignin reduction and genetically engineered trees must be approached with caution and regard\ntowards any unintended consequences.\nFigure 3. Displays the interactions between tree and other populations in the environment as\nwell as the community of organisms that a tree plays host to. (Halpin et al., 2007)\nHypothesis\nThe proposed experiment tests thoroughly the effect of trees with reduced lignin content\nupon the natural environment. I hypothesize that reducing the lignin content of trees will have\nminimal detrimental effects on insect herbivory and trophic interactions within the ecosystem.\nThe impact of low lignin composition in genetically modified trees upon insect feeding\nand insect communities should be little to none. Studies reveal that insects do not show\npreference for leaves from either transgenic or wildtype trees (Pilate et al., 2002). Other\nresearch indicates that survival of forest tent caterpillars and gypsy moth larvae was not linked\nto lignin reduction (Brodeur-Campbell et al. 2006;Robison and Raffa, 1994;Tiimonen et al.,\n2005.) Similarly, Vihervuori et al. (2008) notes that while transgenic trees suffered from more\nleaf damage, no decrease in insect population was detected.\nWhile the aforementioned studies are optimistic about the effects of lignin reduction on\nthe natural environment, there is a general lack of knowledge on how modified lignin content\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\naffects a variety of herbivorous insect populations. The response of herbivorous insects to the\ntransgenes is especially significant since they are the primary consumers in the forest trophic\npyramid and eat the leaves of the modified trees. Without rigorous testing, we cannot assume\nthat low lignin composition in trees will affect all inspect species in the same way.\nField Trial Design\nI propose using the species Populus tremuloides as my test subject due to the ease of\nDNA transformation. The small genome size of poplars, around 450-550 Mbp, has led the\nspecies to become the first woody plant that will have its entire genome sequenced (Taylor,\n2002). In addition, the ability of the species Populus to propagate vegetatively is extremely\nbeneficial since this method of asexual reproduction makes the large-scale production of clones\nfor the experiment very simple. Previous studies, like the one conducted by Pilate et al. (2002),\ndo not specify what kind of poplars were tested. Because Populus tremuloides, or trembling\naspen, is most commonly used for pulping, it is sensible to utilize only the species relevant to\nthe pulping industry for testing of lignin reduction. The modified poplars will express transgenes\nsuppressing the lignin biosynthesis gene cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), thus\nproducing a modified form of lignin that leads to improved pulping efficiency (O'Connell et al.,\n2002).\nWhereas previous research has focused mostly on how transgenic trees affect only one\naspect of the environment, the goal of this experiment is to observe how lignin reduction affects\ntrophic interactions, specifically between herbivorous and non-herbivorous insects. Trembling\naspen has several associated insect herbivores including the larvae of many moth families. For\nthe purposes of this experiment, we will use the larvae of species Bucculatrix staintonella as the\ninsect herbivores because they feed only on trembling aspens. Monophagy in the herbivorous\ninsects is important since using polyphagous insects such as forest tent caterpillars in this\nparticular field trial may not yield results that reflect changes in trophic interactions. In addition to\n\nthe moth larvae, a population of ground beetles will also be introduced. As non-herbivorous\ninsects, their main function is to prey on the insect herbivores. Their interactions with the moth\nlarvae will be important in determining the impact of altered lignin content upon trophic\ndynamics.\nIt is logical to locate the test site in Canada since Populus tremuloides is native to that\nregion and results from the transgenic trees can be compared with the wildtype grown there\n(Taylor, 2002). For this experiment, field trials will last ten years. Although studies conducted\nbefore lasted typically from around four to six years due to constraints in funding, such as the\nones conducted by Vihervuori et al. (2008), long-term field trials are necessary in order to fully\nevaluate the effects of genetically modified trees with reduced lignin content. While it is hardly\nrealistic to conduct a field trial for the entire lifetime of a poplar, which is around seventy to a\nhundred years, experiment time must be sufficiently long enough to detect a consistent trend\nand account for unique circumstances year to year, such as a decrease in insect population. It is\nalso desirable to see if there are any changes as the tree develops and matures. Since poplars\nhave a relatively short life span compared to other species, a longer field trial will be able to\nobserve different stages in the life time of the transgenic trees. To this end, the experiment will\nuse young poplar trees that will mature and become middle-aged within the time span of the\ntrial.\nA total of 40 trees will be used in the experiment, 20 of which will be transgenic poplars,\nand the remaining 20, wildtype. The poplars will be planted in 5 rows and 8 columns, with a gap\nof 1 meter between each tree. The experiment will take place indoors in a greenhouse in order\nto keep out rabbits and other unwanted animals as well as to prevent the emigration and\nimmigration of insect populations. Both herbivorous and nonherbivorous insects will be\nintroduced to the transgenics and wildtype poplars.\nDuring the field trial, patterns in insect populations and tree health will be observed.\n\nMeasurements of population densities of herbivorous and nonherbivorous insects will only be\ntaken in the warm seasons of the year since they go into diapause, or hibernation, for the fall\nand winter. Survival rates of the both species' larvae should be recorded in the spring and\npopulation densities in the summer. General health assessments of the trees should be\nconducted annually at the end of the growing season by both a color assay and size\nmeasurement of the leaves. According to Hoch et al. (2001), color indicates how much stress\nthe tree is under. On a scale from 1 to 4, green leaf color corresponds to 1, mixed green and\nyellow with 2, mixed yellow and red with 3, and mostly red with 4. Another useful way to quantify\ntree health is through the leaf area index (LAI), which is defined as the ratio of total leaf surface\narea of the trees divided by the area of the plot. The growth of the trees will also be monitored\nby recording tree height and basal diameter. At the conclusion of the experiment, all data\ncollected on insect populations and tree health through the duration of the field trial should be\naggregated for evaluation.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nThe presence of humans has indelibly shaped the Earth system as we know it. With the\nadvent of agriculture and industrialization in human history, we have only expedited the process\nby which we exploit and pollute the environment. The burgeoning human population and\nunbridled growth of developing countries result in our outstripping resources we require in order\nto sustain our lifestyle faster than they can be replenished. However, the advances in\ntechnology combined with human creativity have presented geoengineering, or the large-scale\nmanipulation of the environment to counterbalance negative effects of human activity, as a\nmeans of resolving problems like global warming. While geoengineering is hardly a panacea for\nour environmental concerns, the gravity of the situation demands that we consider it as a viable\nsolution when it comes to preserving the health of our home. Field trials for many proposed\ngeoengineering schemes, such as iron fertilization of the oceans and genetically engineered\n\ntrees, have returned promising results in terms of ameliorating the effects of human activity\nwhile having negligible negative impact upon the environment. The challenge then is to keep on\nexpanding our knowledge of the intricate workings of the global Earth system so that we can\ncontinuously improve and adapt our geoengineering schemes to the world we live in.\nIn this specific proposal, we examine how we can decrease the amount of toxic\nchemicals used in pulping process by inserting transgenes expressing reduced lignin content in\ntrees. This is significant on a global level because the bleaching chemicals used in paper mills\neverywhere are often hazardous to human health and result in runoff that destroy local lake and\npond ecosystems. The purpose of this field trial is to shed light on how genetically modified\ntrees with reduced lignin composition impact trophic interactions within the ecosystem. Based\non previous research, we anticipate that the effects on trophic interactions due to low lignin\ncontent in trees should be little to none. Neither non-herbivorous nor herbivorous insect\npopulation should be adversely affected by the transgene. Comparisons between the health of\ntransgene and control trees may find that the transgene trees are more susceptible to cold\nclimate and pests, but this makes sense in that the modified trees do not have as much\nprotection.\nWhether or not the results from this field trial affirm that low lignin content negatively\naffects trophic interactions, future research must continue this focus on trophic dynamics. We\nrecommend that future experiments involve other species of nonherbivorous insects, predators,\nand parasites in conjunction with herbivorous insects since these combinations may reveal\nemergent properties of the ecosystem. These properties would not necessarily show\nthemselves in studies testing the effect of transgenic trees on only one species. In other words,\nthe whole is not a sum of its parts. If we want to understand how the reduced lignin transgene\naffects an ecosystem as a whole, we must simulate the natural environment as accurately as\nwe can and that entails creating a complex web of interactions.\n\nIn addition, it is recommended that future studies in the field expand across species due\nto the global nature of the papermaking industry. It would be remiss to devote research solely to\nPopulus tremuloides when other species of birch, maple, and oak are used extensively for\npulping as well. Only after consistent recommendations have been made from repeated studies\nusing a variety of organisms can conclusions be reached about the transformation and\nimplementation of a particular species in the natural environment. With a more nuanced\nunderstanding of how such changes influence the forest environment, we can avoid inflicting\ninadvertent ecological damage upon resident species and the habitat as a whole.\nIn the context of the global paper industry, the results of this field trial are especially\nsignificant. If the effect on trophic interactions due to lignin reduction is indeed negligible, then\nwe will be able to move more swiftly towards the implementation of transgenic trees as an\nenvironmentally-friendly source of wood and wood products. Not only will we decrease the\nnegative impact that pulping processes have on the immediate environment, we will lessen the\nneed for chemicals which threaten the health of mill workers.\nThe application of genetic engineering to trees all over the world is but one\ngeoengineering scheme that may counterbalance the deleterious effects of human activity.\nThere exist many other ideas that strive to tackle a variety of global environmental concerns.\nRegardless of the geoengineering approach, the key to a livable and healthy Earth entails that\nwe act soon if we are to sustain our present lifestyle and undo the ecological damage we have\ndone. That being said, we cannot act wisely if we do not strive to understand our Earth system.\n\nReferences\nAdams, J. M., Piovesan, G., Strauss, S., & Brown, S. (2002).

      "content": "The Unintended Consequences of Sulfate Aerosols in the\nTroposphere and Lower Stratosphere\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n11/29/2009\n\nExecutive Summary\nSulfate aerosol injection is a geoengineering scheme that has been put forward in order\nto combat the rise in surface temperature of the Earth due to the build up of carbon dioxide in\nthe atmosphere. The build up of aerosols in the atmosphere reflects sunlight away from the\nEarth, as shown by large volcanic eruptions such as those of Mount Pinatubo and El Chichon.\nBoth these eruptions caused a significant decrease in regional surface temperatures for several\nyears following the eruptions; an injection of sulfate aerosols is expected to do the same. There\nare potential side effects of the scheme, however, such as regional precipitation changes, ozone\ndepletion and acid rain. In addition, sulfate aerosol injection does not address continued build\nup of carbon dioxide.\nIn order to quantify the severity of the potential consequences and the effectiveness of\nthe scheme at decreasing global surface temperatures, I have proposed an experiment involving\na small-scale aerosol injection scheme. The experimental design is based on computer\nsimulation models done by Robock et al. (2008). The goal of the experiment is to ascertain the\nside effects of a scheme meant to increase the amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic.\nAlthough the experiment will provide us with valuable knowledge regarding the consequences of\na sulfate aerosol injection scheme, further experimentation will be necessary before any type of\ngeoengineering scheme is undertaken.\n\nAn Introduction to Global Climate Change\nSince the advent of the Industrial Revolution, societies across the globe have\nendeavored to increase their production capacity and, in turn, have increased their contribution\nto global emissions. As a result, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased\nfrom 280 parts per million (ppm) to 380 ppm, and the average global surface temperature has\nincreased by 0.8°C (Bala, 2009). These increases are the result of human perturbation, and\nare likely to continue unchecked, leading to significant climate change that would vastly change\necosystems all over the world.\nGlobal warming and climate change are the result of increases in the concentrations of\nanthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Some of the most prevalent greenhouse\ngases are carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, ozone and nitrous oxide. Although all of these\ngases play a significant role in global climate science, carbon dioxide is the one on which many\nmodels and estimates are based, and which humans play the greatest role in emitting into the\natmosphere.\nNatural greenhouse gases play an important role in our global climate. They act as a\nblanket keeping the Earth's surface at a habitable temperature. This is called the greenhouse\neffect. Without the presence of greenhouse gases such as water vapor and carbon dioxide, the\ntemperature of Earth's surface would be about -19°C instead of the global mean surface\ntemperature of 14°C (Le Treut et al., 2007). This temperature has allowed for the survival and\nproductivity of the human race and has thus permitted the industrialization of the Earth which is\nnow contributing to global climate change and ecosystem destruction.\nThe increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has two major components: the\nemissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement production, and changes in land-use, such\nas deforestation and wood-harvesting. In a typical cycle, natural sinks on land and in the ocean\n\nregulate and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, carbon dioxide is less\nsoluble in warmer waters, which decreases the \"downward transport of anthropogenic carbon\"\n(Bala et al., 2005). In the past 20 years, the growth rate of fossil fuel emissions has increased\nfrom 1.3% per year in 1990 to 3.3% per year from 200-2006 (Canadell et al., 2007). As the\namount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere increases, the efficiency of natural\ncarbon sinks decreases.\nPotential consequences\nIf global emissions continue to grow at such rates, the consequences could be dire.\nSchneider (2009) presents the scenario where our atmosphere has 1,000 ppm of CO2. This\nscenario would lead to a world without the ecosystems unique to Earth such as mountain\nglaciers and coral-reef communities. Although the scenario Schneider presents is extreme, the\nideas he presents are reasonable. Even if only a few of the consequences he lays out come\ntrue, we would face a world significantly different than it is today.\nFor instance, an increase of 1°C above current global temperatures could lead to coral\nbleaching. Coral reef systems are incredibly sensitive to environment changes, and severe\ncoral bleaching has already occurred, such as in 1998 when nearly 16% of reef coral died\n(Walther et al., 2002). An increase of 2.7°C may cause the Greenland ice-cap to melt and at a\nchange of 3°C, catastrophic changes such as \"reversal of the land carbon sink and possible\ndestabilization of the Antarctic ice sheets\" (Bala, 2009).\nTemperatures would vary between regions, because maximum temperatures are\nincreasing more slowly than minimum temperatures, meaning that there are longer freeze-free\nperiods at high latitudes whereas the temperature change in mid-latitude regions is less\nnoticeable (Walther et al., 2002). Climate change has also caused different reactions in many\nspecies. Species whose breeding or migration depends on seasons have been arriving earlier,\n\nsuch as the birds that migrate in the spring. (Walther et al., 2002).\nIn fact, ecosystems may already be committed to long-term changes despite efforts to\ncurb climate change. Jones et al. (2009) details a model involving the Amazon rainforest, which\nsuggests that an increase in the global mean temperature increases the decomposition of soil\nand, coupled with the decrease in precipitation, causes plant productivity to be significantly\ndecreased. Because some effects of climate change, such as \"vegetation cover and carbon\nstorage\" (Jones et al., 2009) differ in the rate of change from precipitation and temperature, it is\nlikely that both terrestrial and marine ecosystems would continue to change even if the climate\nremained the same or returned to its previous state. This may mean that by 2050, the tree\ncover in the Amazon will be less than 50% of what it is today, as shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Amazon forest tree cover in 2050. Color gradient represents fractional coverage. a current b predicted\n(Jones et al., 2009)\nGeoengineering: history and background\nDespite global efforts and treaties to curb carbon dioxide emissions, the concentration of\ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere is still increasing, and it is unlikely that use mitigation alone\n\nMa\np s\nho\nwin\ng\ncur\nre\nnt\nAm\nazo\nn\nfor\nes\nt t\nre\ne c\nov\ner,\na\nnd\npr\nedi\nct\ned\nfo\nres\nt\ncov\ne\nr\ni\nn 2\n0,\nle\nss\nth\nan\n% o\nf t\nhe\ncur\nren\nt f\nore\nst cover.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nwill be enough to protect the environment. Geoengineering is the manipulation of the Earth in\norder to engineer a cooler climate, in order to combat the rising global temperature and carbon\ndioxide concentrations. Human intervention in the climate change problem has both positive\nand negative aspects, but may be an emergency solution in order to prevent extreme\nenvironmental change.\nThe idea of geoengineering has been around in earnest since the 1950s and 60s. The\ntwo major players were the USA and the USSR, both of whom sought to control the climate,\noften for military reasons (Keith, 2000). The Soviet Union considered climate-control to be one\nof \"the most urgent problems of Soviet science\" (Keith, 2000), and proposed many solutions\nakin to those being proposed today. These included cloud seeding and using aerosols in the\natmosphere to change climate patterns both in northern Russia and at the equator. The US\nsimilarly experimented with cloud seeding in the 1950s, and during the Vietnam war used cloud\nseeding to achieve their military goals. This led to an international treaty prohibiting the use of\n\"Environmental Modification Techniques\" (Keith, 2000) for hostile goals.\nAfter this era, geoengineering was often seen in a negative light, and it wasn't until the\n1990s that the mainstream scientific community considered the idea again. Research showed\nthat the current levels of carbon dioxide could take 1,000 years to dissipate, and interest in\nalternate solutions began to peak. Even when geoengineering reappeared in mainstream\npublications, few scientists were willing to put their career on the line to research\ngeoengineering schemes. Geoengineering was not included in reports on anthropogenic\nclimate change, such as those by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, until the\npast several years.\nNow the majority of geoengineering proposals fall into two categories : reducing the\namount of solar radiation that reaches the surface of the Earth, and removing carbon dioxide\nfrom the atmosphere. Proposals that involve reducing the amount of radiation generally involve\n\nincreasing the Earth's albedo, or reflectivity. This can be done either on the surface of the Earth\nby genetically engineering more reflective plants or crops, or in the atmosphere, with schemes\nsuch as cloud seeding, launching aerosols into the atmosphere and launching space shields to\nreflect the sun. Proposals that involve removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere include\niron fertilization of the oceans, underground sequestration of carbon dioxide and marine carbon\ncapture.\nA Brief Look at Individual Schemes\nOne way of removing CO2 from the atmosphere, iron fertilization of the oceans, aims to\ndecrease the carbon dioxide concentration by storing it in biomass, namely phytoplankton. By\nproviding additional iron, one of the key nutrients that phytoplankton need to photosynthesize\nand grow, one can increase the phytoplankton population, which in turn, increases the amount\nof carbon dioxide taken by phytoplankton from the atmosphere. While it seems to be a relatively\nsimple scheme, there is no indication that it will work, and a recent experiment shows that much\nof the added iron will be eaten by krill.\nAnother often proposed scheme is a sun shield. It is on the extreme end of the proposed\nscheme due to both cost and feasibility. While a sun shield may be a more 'green' solution than\nother schemes, it has potential detrimental effects of its own. The concept of a sun shield is that\nthe sun's rays need to be deflected only a few degrees to reduce the global mean surface\ntemperature. This would be achieved by putting small translucent disks \"sunward of the L1\nLagrange point\" (Keith, 2000). A space shield screen, however, is one of the most expensive of\nthe schemes proposed.\nProblems with Geoengineering\nIn general,the potential problems and complications that accompany geoengineering are\n\nvast. They range from political conflicts due to the implementation and control of schemes, to\nthe ability of the geoengineering schemes to work, because our current climate prediction\nmethods, on which many geoengineering models are based, lack accuracy (Bala, 2009). In\naddition, any undertaken scheme would have to be maintained indefinitely because otherwise\nthe Earth could undergo a rapid increase in global temperature or carbon dioxide concentration.\nStratospheric Aerosols\nThe remainder of this paper will focus on the geoengineering scheme that involves\nlaunching sulfate aerosols into the troposphere and lower stratosphere. This scheme falls under\nthe solar radiation management category. The goal of sulfate aerosols is to reduce the global\nmean surface temperature by accumulating aerosols in the atmosphere that will reflect sunlight\naway from Earth. The basis for these observations comes from volcanic eruptions such as Mt.\nPinatubo and El Chichon.\nThe respective eruptions of 1991 and 1982 were the two largest volcanic eruptions of the\n20th century (Robock et al., 2007). Volcanic eruptions inject sulfur dioxide and other particulate\nmatter into the stratosphere. The Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines injected nearly 20 Tg of\nSO2 into the lower stratosphere (Robock et al., 2009), and caused a nearly 1°C decrease in the\nglobal temperature from 1991 to 1993 (Lane et al., 2007). Although volcanic eruptions may be\nanalogous to a stratospheric aerosol geoengineering scheme, one important difference is that\nan eruption injects aerosols over the course of several days, whereas a geoengineering scheme\nwould require constant, gradual injection.\nInjecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere would have a profound effect because the\nnatural concentration of sulfur in the stratosphere is roughly 0.1 Tg S per year, as opposed to\nthe 20 Tg S that the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo forced into the stratosphere. Sulfate aerosols\n\noccur naturally in the stratosphere because of transport of sulfur compounds from the\ntroposphere, though the concentrations introduced by volcanic eruptions are much higher than\nthose that occur naturally. Aerosols have a much longer residence time in the stratosphere than\nthey do in the troposphere. A residence time of several years as opposed to several days\nmeans that fewer aerosols need to be introduced into the stratosphere in order to maintain the\nclimatic effects (Rasch et al., 2008). The characteristics of the stratosphere lead to the\ndispersion of the aerosols over an area larger than the launch site, causing a global, rather than\nlocal, effect, an important aspect of geoengineering. Figure 2 shows the location of the\nstratosphere, troposphere and the tropopause, the layer separating the two. Any sulfate aerosol\ngeoengineering scheme would aim to launch aerosols into the lower stratosphere, between 10\nand 15km above the surface of the Earth.\nFigure 2: Schematic of atmosphere. The troposphere is located from 0 to 10 km, the tropopause is at about 10 km\nand the stratosphere is located from 10 to 50 km. The lower stratosphere is from 10-15 km above the surface of the\nEarth. http://www.windows.ucar.edu/earth/Atmosphere/images/stratosphere_diagram_sm.jpg\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nThe sources of atmospheric aerosols can be both natural and anthropogenic sources.\nExamples include dimethyl sulfide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and carbonyl sulfide (OCS).\nOCS contributes roughly half of the sulfur present in the stratosphere, whereas the other gases\nplay a larger role in the troposphere. The majority of sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere exist in\nthe form of sulfuric acid. The dispersion of aerosol particles over a large area results mainly from\nwind, though the lifetime of a sulfate particle is related to more variables, including\nmeteorological conditions, particle size and concentration (Rasch et al., 2008).\nBefore implementing any geoengineering scheme, it is important to weigh the risks.\nGeoengineering with sulphate aerosols specifically can result in changes to the global\necosystem, the most detrimental of which are perturbations to the hydrological cycle, changes in\natmospheric circulation, continued ocean acidification and acid rain. Robock (2008) outlines\nmany more potential consequences that cut across all schemes including political and\nsuperficial problems, such as conflicts with current treaties and whitening of the skies.\nUnintended Consequences of Sulphate Aerosols\nIn order to understand what may happen when sulfate aerosols are injected into the\natmosphere, and therefore predict the unintended consequences of such a geoengineering\nscheme, we can analyze large scale volcanic eruptions. For example, the Mount Pinatubo\neruption decreased air temperatures and reduced the total amount of water vapor present in the\natmosphere (Trenberth & Dai, 2007). In 1992, following the eruption of Pinatubo, a significant\npercentage of the world experienced drought conditions, a fact attributed to the eruption (Dai et\nal., 2004). In addition, precipitation changes in 1992 were much larger than for other years,\nindicating a relationship between the increase in sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere and the\nhydrological cycle (Trenberth & Dai, 2007). Moreover, volcanic eruptions in the tropics have\n\nbeen shown to cause warming in Northern Hemisphere summers while eruptions at high\nlatitudes cause warming in Northern Hemisphere winters (Oman et al., 2006). The seasonal\ntemperature changes are due to changes in atmospheric circulation. Sulphate aerosols have\nthe potential to cause global changes in precipitation, temperature and water vapor, even if\nreleased from a singular location.\nStratospheric aerosol injection could also cause an increase in acid rain. Some aerosols\nfind their way to the troposphere and hydrate to form sulfuric acid, leading to an increase in acid\ndeposition in a variety of ecosystems (Kravitz et al., 2009). These increases will be most\nnoticed in pristine as opposed to urban areas and areas with significant rainfall will be the most\naffected (Kravitz et al., 2009). Although sulfur is a necessary nutrient in some ecosystems, for\nother ecosystems it can be extremely harmful in excess quantities. Acid rain has led to a\ndecrease in biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems and acidic soils can limit the amount of nutrients\navailable to trees (Kannan & James, 2009). It is not possible to control the areas affected by\nacid rain because sulfate aerosols cause changes in cloud chemistry across the globe.\nAnother significant potential consequence of this scheme is an increase in ozone\ndepletion. The seasonal ozone hole over Antarctica is caused by chemical reactions on the\nsurface of water and nitric acid particles, and injecting sulfate aerosols would increase the\nsurface area on which these chemical reactions can occur (Robock, 2008). As a result, the\nozone hole would become larger, causing even more ultraviolet radiation to reach the Earth. UV\nradiation has negative effects and can cause skin cancer in humans as well as damage to DNA\nand photosensitizers in plants (Stapleton, 1992).\nFinally, combating the rise in global temperature with stratospheric aerosols does not\naddress continued carbon emissions, a significant side effect of global warming. The continued\nbuild up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leads to ocean acidification. The ocean\nuptakes a significant portion of excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (Robock, 2008)\n\nbecause when CO2 is dissolved it forms dissolved carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, bicarbonate\nand carbonate. Ocean acidification significantly affects marine ecosystems such as coral reefs,\nand would have repercussions through the entire biological chain (Robock, 2008).\nThese are only a few of the consequences that may stem from a sulfate aerosol\ngeoengineering scheme. The breadth and severity of their effects need to be considered along\nwith the potential benefits from any scheme.\nHypothesis\nIn order to judge the actual effects of stratospheric sulfate aerosols, it will be necessary\nto run an experiment and gather data. Since there are many potential consequences, no one\nexperiment can analyze them all. The experiment I propose will be designed to test specifically\nfor those consequences which might result from a geoengineering scheme meant to increase\nthe amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic.\nI hypothesize that a sulfate aerosol scheme aimed at increasing the amount of summer\nsea ice in the Arctic will indeed successfully increase the level of ice, but will also cause a\ndrastic change in regional precipitation patterns. Specifically, I expect that the monsoons in\nAfrica and Asia will be weakened. I base my hypothesis on the analysis of high-latitude volcanic\neruptions, events which produce changes in atmospheric circulation in Northern Hemisphere\nsummers (Oman et al., 2006), and are followed by weakened monsoons (Graf, 1992; Oman et\nal., 2006). Since a high-latitude sulfate injection scheme would be a parallel event to a volcanic\neruption, I expect similar changes to follow.\nMonsoons are caused by a temperature gradient between the ocean and land. An\nincrease in the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere has been shown to decrease the\ntemperature gradient and reduce cloud cover over land(Oman et al., 2005). These two\nconsequences lead to an increase in temperature because of a decrease in cloudiness and soil\n\nmoisture (Graf, 1992; Oman et al., 2005). Less rain and increased temperatures during the\nformer rainy season can lead to droughts, affecting the food production of hundreds of\nthousands of people who depend on subsistence agriculture. This is a secondary consequence\nof the proposed scheme, but is one that has potential to affect the livelihood and survival of\npeople on many continents.\nExperimental Design\nI will base my experimental design on the models done by Robock et al. (2008). These\nmodels will guide the amount of material injected, the region it is injected from and the size of\nthe aerosols. For the launching mechanism, I rely on recommendations by Budyko (1977) and\nRobock et al. (2009).\nThe model used by Robock et al. (2008) is the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE atmosphere-ocean general\ncirculation model. This model has correctly simulated the conditions following volcanic eruptions\nsuch as the 1783 Laki eruption in Iceland and 1912 Katmai eruption in Alaska(Robock et al.,\n2008; Oman et al., 2005). In fact, Robock et al. (2008) conducted multiple simulations, including\na control experiment, a simulation of tropical aerosol injection and an arctic aerosol experiment.\nMoreover, the model simulates a dynamic as opposed to slab ocean, a reason for which I\nbelieve that the set up can be relayed onto a real experiment. As stated in the hypothesis, the\nproposed experiment will focus on the Arctic in an effort to ascertain the effects of sulphate\naerosol injection on the summer sea ice, and related climatic responses, particularly those\nimpacting precipitation in Africa and Asia.\nIt is important to remember, however, that this is an experiment and not a true\ngeoengineering scheme. Consequently, it will be important to keep sulfate levels within a range\nof what the Earth has dealt with before. The Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption launched 20 Mt of\n\nSO2 into the stratosphere (Bluth et al., 1992), and therefore the sulfate levels for this experiment\nwill be kept below this level.\nTechnical Details\nThere are many variables that must be taken into account in this experiment, including\nparticle size, altitude and location of launch as well as the lifetime of the aerosol. The particles\nfrom the Mt. Pinatubo eruption had a 0.35 μm radius, however smaller particles have longer\nstratospheric lifetimes, so fewer injections would be needed (Rasch et al., 2008). Thus, this\nexperiment will use particles with a 0.25 μm radius, which have an average stratospheric lifetime\nof two years (Budyko, 1977). I propose launching the aerosols at latitude 68oN in an effort to\nconfine the effects of the scheme to the Arctic. The longitude is arbitrary due to the atmospheric\nproperties (Robock et al., 2008). Robock et al. (2009) suggests the Gunnbjørn Fjeld in\nGreenland, located at 68oN, because it is the highest point in the Arctic, thus requiring less\nenergy to get the material to the stratosphere. Because aerosols have a longer lifetime in the\nstratosphere than troposphere, they will be launched into the lower stratosphere, an altitude\nbetween 10-15 km (Robock et al., 2008).\nIn an effort to confine the climatic response to geoengineering, a lower rate of injection is\nused, and again, following the simulation of Robock et al.(2008), the sulfate aerosols will be\ninjected at a rate of 3 Mt/annum. This is suitable for an experiment, because it is equivalent to a\nPinatubo eruption every 6.67 years, and would cause a sulfate level that would not overburden\nthe Earth's natural capacity. The experiment will be continued for 10 years, long enough to see a\ndecrease in global average surface temperature according to Robock et al. (2008). This would\nmean over 10 years, a total of 30 Mt SO2 will be introduced into the lower stratosphere.\nDue to the dark Arctic winter, the frequency of injections through the fall and winter would\nnot need to be as great because aerosols have no effect in the dark winter (Robock et al.,\n\n2009). However, the lifetime of particles in the Arctic is shorter than it would be in the tropics\nbecause aerosols are removed primarily in the Arctic, whereas tropical aerosols first must be\ntransported poleward (Robock et al., 2008). This is a benefit to this experiment because we are\nstriving to confine the effects only to the Arctic region, a reasonable effort because high-latitude\nvolcanic eruptions generally have aerosols confined to the hemisphere in which the eruption\ntook place (Oman et al., 2005).\nFigure 3: Proposed methods of sulfate aerosol injection into the stratosphere. Drawing by Brian West. (Robock et\nal., 2009).\nLaunching Mechanism\nSo far, little experimentation has been done with different launching mechanisms.\nHowever, many possibilities, such as airplanes, artillery shells and stratospheric balloons have\nbeen proposed (Robock et al., 2009). Figure 3 illustrates these ideas.\nOf all these options, the most practical one to use is airplanes. The reason is that\ntechnology capable of flying into the lower stratosphere in both the tropics and the Arctic already\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nexists. In fact, larger planes with a larger payload can be used in the Arctic due to a lower\nstratospheric altitude in that region. Robock et al. (2009) suggests planes such as the KC-135\nStratotanker or the KC-10 Extender, both of which have a large payload and can be operated\ncontinuously. A large fleet of these craft would be available at a minimal additional cost because\nthey are currently used in the military.\nAnother aspect of the experiment that needs to be considered is the method of sulfur\ndispersal. Budyko (1977) originally suggested adding sulfur to plane fuel. This method,\nhowever, would require that the fuel used in the stratosphere be separated from the fuel used\nbelow the tropopause in order to minimize pollution of the troposphere (Robock et al., 2009). A\nmore practical option is to attach a nozzle to the plane running from a separate tank. In fact,\nboth of the suggested aircraft already have a nozzle, as shown in Figure 4, because of their use\nas mid-flight refuelers, so no additional alterations would be required.\nFigure 4: KC-10 Extender refueling a plane in mid-flight. Adapted from Robock et al., 2009.\nExperimental Details\nBecause this experiment uses the Earth system, a replicate experiment is not possible.\nHowever, the data collected will be compared to climate data for the ten years proceeding the\nten year experiment in order to form recommendations on the feasibility, practicality and\nworthiness of a sulfate aerosol geoengineering scheme. The majority of the data necessary to\nunderstand the implications of the geoengineering scheme is already collected on a regular\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nbasis, so it would only be a matter of collating all data sources into one central location or\ndatabase.\nBecause the goal of this experiment is to understand the unintended consequences of\ngeoengineering, the data collected will include information on Arctic sea ice, such as square\nmileage, depth, sea level pressure and Arctic coastal precipitation, but also extensive data on\nprecipitation patterns over Africa and Asia. Data points over Africa and Asia will include annual\naverage surface air temperature, solar radiation (downward shortwave radiation), monthly global\nprecipitation and the latitudinal spread of aerosols over the course of each year. In addition,\nregional data will be taken in order to show the regional changes in surface air temperature and\nprecipitation. Using this data, it will be possible to evaluate the effects that the geoengineering\nscheme has had on various regional ecosystems and to make recommendations about further\nuse.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nResults\nIt is very likely that a sulfate aerosol geoengineering scheme carried out similarly to the\nexperiment described in the previous section would significantly increase the amount of Arctic\nsea ice, by between 10-25% of current levels, according to Robock, et al. (2008). However, in\nthe process of increasing sea ice level, it is certain that other regions of the world would\nexperience variable climates. There would be a precipitation change associated with a weaker\nsummer monsoon over India and Northern China, as well as a reduction in precipitation over the\nSahel desert in Western Africa. These changes are depicted in Figure 5. Although the figure\nshows that there is an increase in precipitation in some regions of the world, the increases\ngenerally occur over open ocean and have little effect on land masses, whereas the negative\n\nchanges in precipitation would severely impact large human populations. In East Africa, for\nexample, monsoons control the two rainy seasons, and farmers in the region are dependent on\nthis rain in an otherwise dry region (Nairobi, 1979). In India, not only do monsoons provide the\nmajority of rain for the sub-continent, but they also have cultural importance and symbolize\nromance and beauty. Undertaking a sulfate aerosol scheme could potentially cause many\nnegative consequences on global environments.\nFigure 5: Precipitation changes following a sulfate aerosol geoengineering scheme. Brown color depicts negative\nchanges. Green color depicts positive changes. Adapted from Robock, et al. (2008).\nRecommendations\nAlthough the proposed experiment tests many aspects of a sulfate aerosol scheme,\nthere are many more unknowns. It would be unwise to implement a global, long-term\ngeoengineering scheme without further experimentation or political negotiation on a global\nscale. Any geoengineering scheme would have to be taken on for an indefinite length of time\nbecause of the risk of rapid temperature and carbon dioxide increases if it were halted. The\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nglobal environmental impacts mean that every country must be in agreement of the indefinite\nnature of the scheme and of the environmental impacts.\nDetailed documentation is needed on the environmental impacts on different global\nenvironments and whether any negative effects that may occur can be mitigated. This will\nrequire cooperation from researchers outside the field of geoengineering. A global organization,\nperhaps the United Nations, would need to be in charge of a geoengineering scheme and the\napproval process could potentially take years. Negotiation must be started soon because global\nwarming is reaching a critical level and global warming is beginning to reach a critical level in\nwhich some type of action must be undertaken in the next several years.\nConclusion\nGeoengineering is one way to combat global climate change. There are many types of\ngeoengineering and before any scheme is implemented, much more research has to be done\ninto its effectiveness and side effects. We cannot say at this point whether geoengineering is\nbetter or more effective than decreasing the cause of global warming, carbon dioxide emissions,\nbut it is one possibility and could provide a relatively quick solution.\nGeoengineering with sulfate aerosols has potential to mitigate the effect of rising surface\ntemperatures; it is relatively cheap compared to other methods aiming to reduce solar radiation\nand has a somewhat assured effectiveness due to the parallel with volcanic eruptions.\nHowever, although the experiment presented in this paper details its effectiveness, it also\npresents potential consequences. These consequences need to be considered and retested,\nalong with possible political and social consequences before a definitive decision on\nimplementation can be made.\nWe cannot yet discount the possibility of geoengineering nor can we proceed with a full\n\nfledged implementation. Instead, the global scientific and political communities need to continue\nworking together to develop experiments and treaties regarding geoengineering.\n\nReferences\nBaker, M., & Peter, T. (2008).

You are not bound by your specific design\nhere, but the overview gives you an opportunity to put forth ideas and get feedback on them.\n-\nYour Description should be written in complete and connected sentences, it should not\nbe a list of bullets (see sample Project Description, part II of this handout).\n-\nYour Project Description should be about 750 words (not including the\naccompanying Reference list) and must include at least five references that are cited\nwithin. The references must come from peer-reviewed journals and you should explain\nthe relevance of the articles for your proposal.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.018J / 7.30J Ecology I: The Earth\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Golconda on\nNovember 25, 1889, when she was off the Great Hanish Islands\nin the Red Sea, in lat. 1 3 ~ ~ 5 6\nN., and long. 4z0.30 E.\nThe particulars of the flight may be worthy of record.\nIt was first seen crossing the sun's disk at about I r a.m. as a\ndense white flocculent mass, travelling towards the north-east at\nabout the rateof twelve miles an hour. It was observed at noon\nby the officer on watch as passing the sun in the same state of\ndensity and with equal speed, and so continued till after 2 p.m.\nThe flight took place at so high an altitude that it mas only\nvisible when the locusts were between the eye of the observer and\nthe sun ;but the flight must have continued a long time after\n2 p.m., as numerous stragglers fell on board the ship as late as\n6 p.m.\nThe course of flight was across the bow of the ship, which at\nthe time was directed about 17\" west of north, and the flight\nwas evidently directed from the African to the Arabian shore of\nthe Red Sea.\nThe steamship was travelling at the rate of thirteen miles an\nhour, and, supposing the host of insects to have taken only four\nhours in passing, it must have been about 2oao square miles in\nextent.\nSome of us on board amused ourselves with the calculation\nthat, if the length and breadth of the swarm were forty-eight\nmiles, its ihickness half a mile, its density 144 locusts to a cubic\nfoot, and the weight of each locust 2G of an ounce, then it\nwould have covered an area of 2304 square miles ; the nomber\nof insects would have been 24,420 billions; the weight of\nthe mass 42,580, millions of tons ; and our good ship of 6000\ntons burden would have had to make 7,000,wovoyages to carry\nthis great host of locusts, even if packed together I I r times more\nclosely than they were flying.\nMr. J. IVilson, the chief officer of the Golcortda, permits me\nto say that he quite agrees with me in the statement of the facts\ngiven above.\nHe also states that on the following morning\nanother flight was seen going in the same north-easterly direction\nfrom 4.15 a.m. to 5 a.m.\nIt was apparently a stronger brood\nand more closely packed, and appeared like a heavy black cloud\non the horizon.\nThe locusts were of a red colour, were about 24 inches long,\nand ,',of an ounce in weight.\nG.

The substitute for this proof which finds most favour\nwith modern writers is, of course, that depending on the\n' $ parallelogram of accelerations.\"\nBut this is open to almost\nas serious objections as the other.\nFor it introduces kinetic\nideas which are really nowhere again used in statics.\nshould therefore propose the following proof, which depends on\nvery elementary geometrical propositions. The general order of\nargument resembles that of Laplace.\nI adopt the \"trianylrr \" instead of the \"parallelognmmic \"\nform. Thus, if PQ, QR represent in length and direction any\ndirected magnitudes whatever, and, if these haze a sing(e eqtfi-\nvalent, that single equivalent will be represented by PR.\nhi\nN\nFIG.3.\nOP = OQ, QP = ON, NQ, QR, R P = Ohf, hlP.\n(4) Finally, by (I), theorem holds for isosceles right-angled\ntriangle ; .'. by (2) it holds for right-angled triangle containing\nangle 90\" + 2\" ;.'.>y (3) it holds for right-angled triangle con-\ntaining angle\n90 + zn :i.e. for any angle (as may be shown,\nif considered necessary, by the method for incommensurables in\nDuchayla'~ proof).\nHence, if AD be perpendicular on BC in any triangle,\nB A , A C = B D , D A , A D , A C = B C .\nQ.E.D.\nIV.
