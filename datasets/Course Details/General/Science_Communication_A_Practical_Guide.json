  "course_description": "This class develops the abilities of students to communicate science effectively in a variety of real-world contexts. It covers strategies for dealing with complex areas like theoretical physics, genomics and neuroscience, and addresses challenges in communicating about topics such as climate change and evolution. Projects focus on speaking and writing, being an expert witness, preparing briefings for policy-makers, writing blogs, and giving live interviews for broadcast, as well as the creation of an interactive exhibit for display in the MIT Museum.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session\n\nCourse Aims\n\nTo provide an introduction to popular science communication in the broader contexts of (a) the role of communication in science, and (b) the cultural, practical and policy-related role of science communication in wider society;\n\nTo provide intellectual resources for constructive critical analysis of popular science communication in a variety of real-world settings;\n\nTo cultivate students' practical communication skills, with particular emphasis on effective speaking, writing and exhibiting on scientific and science-related topics to a variety of audiences;\n\nTo provide students with a range of resources and skills for effective communication of complex material;\n\nTo provide students with the opportunity to undertake a substantial practical project in either science writing or science exhibiting.\n\nTextbooks\n\nSkloot, Rebecca.\nThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\n. Broadway Publishers, 2011. ISBN: 9781400052172.\n\nOther required readings (and required audio, video and exhibition materials) are listed separately on the\nreadings\npage.\n\nCourse Requirements and Assessment\n\nThe course will comprise two 90-minute seminars per week, at 11:30am - 1:00pm on Mondays and Wednesdays throughout the fall semester. The Monday seminars are devoted mainly to seminar discussion of key topics, and the Wednesday seminars are devoted mainly to work (individually, and in groups) on practical communication projects.\n\nStudents are required to attend and participate actively in the seminars. Students who are unable to attend a seminar for medical or other reasons should inform the professor in advance. Unexplained poor attendance and failure to participate actively in seminars will affect the overall grade on the course.\n\nAssignments (which may involve reading, listening to or viewing relevant sources before class, written composition, or exhibition-related work) will be set on a weekly basis. It is essential that students should complete pre-class assignments, as this will be essential to effective participation in the relevant seminar discussions.\n\nThis is a communications intensive (CI-HW) class. CI-HW subjects are a subset of CI-H subjects concentrating more particularly on the writing process. Given how important revision is to composition, many assignments will be revised. The emphasis in all the CI-HW sections is on writing: the writing process, from pre-writing through drafting, revising, and editing; and the rhetorical dimensions of writing: the audience for whom one is writing, and the purpose for which one is writing--to argue, inform, persuade, explain, convince, and so on.\n\nAssessment\n\nGrades on the course will be based on the following marking scheme:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nAttendance at and active participation in seminars\n\n20%\n\nAssessed speaking assignments\n\n10%\n\nAssessed writing assignments\n\n30%\n\nPractical Project\n\n40%\n\nClass Calendar and Overview\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nIntroduction: Why Be A Science Communicator?\n\nIn the Elevator or the Hallway: Talking Informally About Science\n\nWorkshop: Talking Science\n\nWorkshop: Talking Science (contd)\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Write About Science for the Public?\n\nRivers of Ice: Vanishing Glaciers in the Greater Himalaya\n\nGuest speaker: David Breashears, director of Glacierworks\n\nTelling a Tale, Painting a Picture: Writing About Science Using Special Techniques\n\nWorkshop: Writing Science\n\nWorkshop: Writing Science (contd)\n\nExhibiting \"Unfinished\" Science\n\nCritiquing Science on Display (reviews of exhibits)\n\nPut Me Through to Washington: Communicating Science to Policymakers\n\nWorkshop: Projects\n\nGuest Speaker: David Goldston\n\nScience in the Blogosphere\n\nSeeing is Believing: Visualizing Science for Communication\n\nGuest Speaker: Jonathan Corum, science graphics editor at the New York Times\n\nWorkshop: Projects\n\nFrom Cancer Cells to String Theory: Communicating Complex Material\n\nWorkshop: Projects\n\nCommunicating Controversy\n\nOn the Record: Communicating to the Media\n\nWorkshop: Projects\n\nOn the Witness Stand: Communicating Science in the Courtroom\n\nWorkshop: Projects\n\nFinal Projects\n\nFinal Projects",
