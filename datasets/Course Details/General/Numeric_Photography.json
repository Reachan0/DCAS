  "course_description": "The aim of the students from the Numeric Photography class at the MIT Media Laboratory was to present an exhibition of digital artworks which blend photography and computation, in the context of scene capture, image play, and interaction. Equipped with low end digital cameras, students created weekly software projects to explore aesthetic issues in signal processing and interaction design. The results are more than a hundred JavaÂ® applets, many of which are interactive, that suggest new avenues for image play on the computer. These weekly exercises led to the final product, an exhibition of the student work.",

And of course flipping back to the spatial representation at will.\nEmphasis will be placed upon the frequency spectrum mode, where you should\ndesign special brushes that emphasize various characteristics of the frequency\ndomain.\nPart 1: Basic Paint System\nIn an applet of maximum size 600 pixels wide by 400 pixels high, design a simple\npaint program that allows you to load and edit a grayscale image.\nPart 2: Frequency Domain Conversion\nAdd a button to your applet that takes the contents of the image, and converts it\nto a frequency domain representation (also a graylevel image). When that button\nis pressed, you should flip back to the spatial domain, and so forth.\nPart 3:\nDesign one special painting mode that allows you to play with the frequency\ndomain in a special way that relates to the spatial domain."

Place this white cube on top\nof an identically white paper material. Arrange a maximum of 5 achromatic\nlights pointed at the cube.\nPart 1: Take Some Pictures\nShoot at least 64 different scenes of the cube, in different lighting conditions, or\nin the same lit conditions. Experiment with different lighting combinations and\nthe ambient light situation.\nPart 2: Basic Animation System\nIn an applet of maximum size 600 pixels wide by 400 pixels high, design a simple\ndisplay engine that displays a series of images, at a varied speed of display. For\ninstance, displaying images A, B, C, D, between A and B there can be a delay of\n150 milliseconds, between B and C a delay of 300 milliseconds, and C and D a\ndelay of 0 milliseconds. In otherwords, a variable speed playback engine where\nthe timing is predetermined by some form of script.\nPart 3: Tell a Story of the Cube\nGiven the frames you have shot, preload all of them (make sure they are all\nloaded with MediaTracker), and fire them away at a speed that tells a story of the\nessence of the cube you are shooting, as well as its surrounding lit conditions.\nSince you want to animate, you may want to limit the size of your images.\nFurthermore, do not exceed 1 minute to tell your story. DO NOT apply any type\nof special effect (like digital pan, zoom, etc. as geilfuss had demonstrated in ps1).\nWe are focusing upon just the pictures, and how you crop them."

In other words, given 6\nimages, create 12 images (or 18, 24, etc. however fine-grain you wish to get) that\nrepresent combinations of the image in some way that creates the inbetween\ncolor.\nPart 3: Paint with your Palette\nUsing these image chips, allow a user to select from the widened palette and\npaint with the images as brushes (there are many innovations possible at this\nstep)."
