  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nDiscussions: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session\n\nDescription\n\nThis seminar will cover the evolution of the aerospace industry and explore current events with the aim of preparing students for summer internships and post baccalaureate plans. Readings from the recent book\nLean Enterprise Value: Insights from MIT's Lean Aerospace Initiative\nand the weekly publication\nAviation Week & Space Technology\nwill form the basis for class discussions, which will also include invited subject matter experts. The course is restricted to juniors and seniors in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Enrollment is limited to approximately 20 students.\n\nInstructors\n\nProf. Earll Murman\n\nJennifer Lynn Craig\n\nBarbara Lechner\n\nPrerequisites\n\n16.03-16.04\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nAfter taking 16.812, students will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the evolution and recent history of the aerospace industry, especially the post Cold War transformation of the industry.\n\nDiscuss current events shaping the aerospace industry and its programs - both aeronautics and astronautics.\n\nAppreciate value creation as a basis for successful aerospace programs and enterprises.\n\nExercise reflective thinking as a means to comprehend personal growth and their own relationship with the aerospace field.\n\nArticulate their career interests, with an emphasis on summer internships or post baccalaureate plans.\n\nMeasurable Outcomes\n\nStudents will:\n\nParticipate in weekly class discussions, including the opportunity to lead such discussions.\n\nKeep a weekly journal capturing important findings and thoughts during the semester related to the subject learning objectives.\n\nDemonstrate comprehension of the evolution of the aerospace industry and current events shaping its future through class discussions and journal entries.\n\nArticulate their semester long learning and career interests in an end-of-semester interview with the course instructors.\n\nClasses\n\nClass sessions will be devoted to small group (4-5 students) and full class discussions based upon two weekly readings:\n\nThe weekly magazine\nAviation Week & Space Technology\nwill be the source for current events. Class participants are expected to read selected articles in the current issue of Aviation Week to prepare for class discussion. It is expected 3-4 articles will be discussed each week.\n\nOne or two chapters from\nLean Enterprise Value: Insights from MIT's Lean Aerospace Initiative\nwill be the source material for the evolution and structure of the aerospace industry.\n\nSubject matter experts (SMEs), drawn largely from the MIT faculty, will be invited to join the class each week to participate in the discussion. The intent of these discussions is to: deepen the student's understanding of the reading material; develop abilities for critical analysis of topical material; develop a sense of the linkages of current events with industrial evolution; prepare students to enter the industry with \"situational awareness\".\n\nThe course faculty will meet after weeks 5 and 10 to review student preparation for and participation in class discussions for the preceding period using the grading guidelines given below. The resulting grades, each worth 25% of the semester grade, will be sent to each student along with tips for improving their performance.\n\nExcellent Performance\n(23-25)\n\nDemonstrates excellent: understanding of the week's readings; contributions to class discussion; listening abilities for other's contributions; attention to engaging other class members and guests / faculty in the group discussions.\n\nGood Performance\n(20-22)\n\nDemonstrates good: understanding of the week's readings; contributions to class discussion; listening abilities for other's contributions; attention to engaging other class members and guests / faculty in the group discussions.\n\nAdequate Performance\n(17-19)\n\nDemonstrates adequate: understanding of the week's readings; contributions to class discussion; listening abilities for other's contributions; attention to engaging other class members and guests / faculty in the group discussions.\n\nMinimally Acceptable Performance\n(13-16)\n\nDemonstrates minimally acceptable: understanding of the week's readings; contributions to class discussion; listening abilities for other's contributions; attention to engaging other class members and guests / faculty in the group discussions.\n\nUnacceptable Performance\n(0-12)\n\nDemonstrates unacceptable: understanding of the week's readings; contributions to class discussion; listening abilities for other's contributions; attention to engaging other class members and guests / faculty in the group discussions.\n\nInstructor Interview\n\nEach student will meet with the course faculty near the end of the semester for a thirty-minute interview to discuss progress for the course learning objectives. Prior to the interview, the student should review the course learning objectives and to what extent they were realized during the semester. Each student will be asked to identify the 4-5 most important things they learned during the seminar, why they were important and what was learned. They will also be asked about their evolving career interests and how the student intends to pursue career opportunities. These interviews will be informal dialog and are intended to help focus the student on \"take-aways\" from the semester. The interview will account for 20% of the final grade.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nPreparation for and participation in class discussion, Weeks 1-5\n\n25%\n\nPreparation for and participation in class discussion, Weeks 6-10\n\n25%\n\nThree journal periods at 10% per period\n\n30%\n\nInstructor interview\n\n20%\n\nReadings\n\nReadings from the following textbook and magazine will be assigned:\n\nMurman, et al.\nLean Enterprise Value: Insights from MIT's Lean Aerospace Initiative.\nPalgrave Macmillan, March 2002.

      "content": "16.812 Lecture 1\n\n-\nJournals in this seminar are not the free-writing you may have practiced in high\nschool nor are they particularly self-reflective although that may come into it.\n\n-\nInstead we are practicing journal skills as a way to expand your abilities to think\ncritically. As you've heard the faculty say, much of professional life is making\ndecisions based on good critical thinking.\n\n-\nYour syllabus packet has a list of prompts that you might use if you get \"writer's\nblock\" when you are responding to an article or chapter. There are other\nquestions to ask, of course, but these are some basic ones.\n\n-\nCritical thinking prompts fall into basic categories:\n\no What are the facts I know?\no Can I explain this? Do I understand it?\no Can I use it? Apply it?\no Do I understand the key parts of this idea? This situation?\no Can I take different ideas and put them together in something coherent or\nin a new way?\no Can I evaluate something or someone or myself based on standards or\ncriteria?\n\n-\nWe're going to do some active learning to start to use these ideas.\n-\nFor example,\no Who knows the story Jack and the Beanstalk? In most versions of this\nfairy tale,\nJack and his mom are very poor.\nJack's mom tells him to sell the cow because they are out of\nmoney.\nInstead, Jack trades the cow for some beans.\nWhen his mom is frustrated and throws the beans out of the\nwindow, the beans grow into a stalk.\nJack climbs the stalk into the giant's home where the giant is\nsleeping.\nJack steals the giant's gold and also takes a hen.\nThe hen squawks and wakes the giant who chases Jack down the\nbeanstalk. The giant falls and is killed.\nJack and his mom live happily because they have money now.\n\nPlease note that we've enumerated the facts we know and analyzed the fairy tale\ninto its key parts.\n\nBut let's go further. If Jack disobeyed his mom, made a bad business decision,\nwas guilty of breaking and entering, of greed, of theft of money and property, and\n\nof contributing to death of a giant who really wasn't bothering him, then why is\nthe giant always the bad guy?\n\nIn other words, what kind of story would it be if we thought about this\ndifferently?\n\nWe would use our skills of comprehension. We'd be synthesizing those key parts\nof the story differently, and we'd be evaluating them against different criteria--\nnot the fairy tale criteria but more contemporary standards.\n\nThis is a lighthearted active learning exercise, but you can apply those same\ncritical thinking skills to current events in the aerospace industry."

Achieve what sci-fi\nhas indicated\n- National pride - Pride is important. Countries invest in\nnational pride projects. China is a current example. But\ndoes this lead you to human space flight. Going to Mars\ncould win the argument. How much are you willing to\npay? Would human space flight be more compelling than\nsomething else?\n- Commercial benefits - ?? - Trap.

      "content": "16.812 Journal Entry\nIntroduction\nThe seminar today had a very different, but well appreciated feel. We had two\nwonderful Morgan Stanley representatives who work with aerospace company\nstocks talk to us about their views of the industry. It was very good to get their\nperspective from the management/business side of the industry, versus the\npurely technical/engineering side. I thought these presenters provided a good\nlink to the discussion of lean enterprise.\nLean Enterprise\nThe focus of the lean enterprise section of today's discussion was cargo planes\nand predicted growth for their use. To be honest, I have never given that much\nthought to cargo planes. I was very surprised in fact when Prof. Murman\ncommented that each Boeing aircraft program begins with a design for both a\npassenger and freight variation. The numbers of percent growth for cargo plane\ndemand were also staggering. It seems that Asia will be dominating the skies\nespecially with its current demand and future demand for cargo aircraft. It also\nmakes sense to me now why Airbus and Boeing are both developing a new wide-\nbody aircraft. This craft will be highly valued by these future markets and will\nprovide a good source of revenue for both companies.\nArticle Description\nOn a different note, the discussion revolving around Aviation Week topics for my\ngroup was whether or not R&D for zero point energy would be a better financial\ninvestment than scramjet technology. My group was responsible for developing\nthe cons to this argument, thus creating reasons why scramjet technology would\nbe more valuable. I think there was a good argument for both. I personally\nwould love to see zero point energy developed into a useful form since the\nphysics behind it is so intriguing. Scramjet technology would also be a great\ninnovation, especially since it could be applied to single stage rocket engines.\nNew Insights\nMy major insight today was a general glimpse at how the financial side of the\naerospace industry works. I think our Morgan Stanley guest, Heather, did a good\njob at making us see the industry through her eyes. Particularly the Boeing vs.\nAirbus comparison that Heather talked about allowed me to see how stock\nmarket data can be interpreted very differently by different people. I was glad to\nhear though, that Boeing is currently in good shape and not overly concerned\nabout competition from their foreign competitor Airbus."

      "content": "16.812 Journal Entry\nIt seems that one cannot escape from the harsh world of Wall Street. Although\nharsh is a subjective term, it is the typical reaction someone without a business\nbackground would have to Wall Street's methods and way of thinking. However,\none cannot see the business world as the enemy. One has to reconcile their\nstake in an engineering business with that of the engineers and scientists. Once\nan engineering enterprise can work together with Wall Street, then there may\nexist a balance and understanding between the stakeholder values of the\ninvestor or shareholder with those of the employee or engineer.\nIn large aerospace enterprises, such as space launches, not appreciating\ninvestor stakeholders is akin to business suicide. The business of space has\nnotoriously been unprofitable. Is this the reason why many investors have\nhistorically shied away, or is because space enterprises haven't allowed for the\ninvestor stakeholders more leverage that the businesses haven't been as\nsuccessful? The only success stories in space have been communications\nsatellites, such as DirecTV. But even those have really only been able to break\neven, and have not had large returns on investment. GPS has been the other\nsuccess story, but that business has grown out of a military application. A large\npart of the development costs were absorbed by the military and their early use\nof GPS.\nCivil air transport has been even more volatile as a business, with airlines cycling\nthrough periods of growth and losses. And growth, although overall steady in the\nindustry, hasn't always been able to counter the huge losses airlines have had.\nThere have been numerous airlines through the last 20 years since deregulation\nthat have folded, such as Pan-Am. However, there have been a few airlines that\nseem to have been extremely successful in spite of the economic and business\ncycles, and to have been able to hold a high level of profitability - two examples\nbeing Southwest and Jet Blue. Southwest has built a robust, profitable, and\nefficient business model, and has been able to remain profitable for the last\ntwenty years. Jet Blue is a low-cost airline that has seen extraordinary growth\nand profitability in its initial years of operation. These two examples show that\npossibilities exist for businesses to grow and become very profitable, returning\nvalue to their investors, in an industry that has seen diminishing returns over the\nlast half-a-century.\nThese counter examples seem to indicate that the aerospace industry, as a\nwhole, has not been able to assess and offer value to its shareholder and\ninvestor partners. The one issue that most employees and engineers in business\nseem to have is that investor values in an enterprise are at odds with their own.\nThis leads to the obvious conflicts between the investor or business aspect side\nof the enterprise and the engineer/employee side. It could be that both sides are\nnot able to reconcile each other's means, although their goals may be the same\n\n- that of creating and supporting a successful enterprise. The solution would\nappear to be to come and work together, understanding the value and\nexpectations each have for their stake in the enterprise, and developing a\nworkable solution for the enterprise to achieve the goals and expectations."

      "content": "16.812 Journal Entry\nAware of the summer 2003 ethics violations at Boeing Launch Systems in which\ntwo former Lockheed Martin employees used proprietary documents from the\nAtlas program for the Delta program, this seems to be a particularly bad time for\nBoeing and its credibility to its number one customer: the U.S. government.\nProfessor Murman identified the root cause of this most recent controversy as\nthe $17 billion tanker lease. There is a clear conflict-of-interest for government\nofficials who maintain financial ties in the private sector while also serving in a\npolicymaking capacity for the same industry. In this case, Druyun's financial\nstake in Boeing was a job and her conflict-of-interest stems from her ability to\npresumably influence procurement of Boeing products.\nA host of issues were raised by reading between the lines in the press release,\nincluding the true awareness of the other executives of the events surrounding\nthe Druyun hiring (especially given the resignation of CEO Phil Condit a week\nlater), the unsettling recent-history of Boeing and ethics issues, and the potential\nconnection between the firing of the CFO and the fiscal shape of the corporation.\nMy group questioned the authority of the \"Office of Internal Governance\" to effect\npositive ethical change in Boeing business practices.\nAll in all, I found this case to be a fascinating introduction to a rapidly maturing\nindustry where post-Cold War consolidation has taken its toll on corporate profits.\nWith a declining number of tradition aerospace programs to bid on, I guess that it\nmakes sense that unsavory business practices would increase in frequency. It\nshould be interesting to observe how the government punishes Boeing. Perhaps\nthe procurement of the 100 tankers will be delayed or reduced? Surely the\npunishment won't be too severe. In order to maintain some degree of\ncompetition in the aerospace industry, the government may need Boeing to\nremain viable against Lockheed Martin and Raytheon as much as Boeing needs\nthe government to stay in business."
