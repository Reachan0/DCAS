(and\nsimilar expressions in other languages)\nTopics to be explored in this course:\n3⁄4 Central theme: The semantics of attitude predicates\nExpanding the domain:\n3⁄4 Speech predicates (say, ask, etc.)\n(since these have many semantic and syntactic parallels with attitude predicates)\n3⁄4 Syntax of sentence embedding\n(since speech and attitude predicates typically take sentential complements of\nvarious kinds)\n3⁄4 Formal Pragmatics - Theory of conversation and common ground\nthat is, the ways that shared information is updated in the course of conversations\n(since this involves many of the same formal tools as the semantics of\npropositional attitudes)\n\nFeb. 3\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nSpecific Topics\n(The list below will have substantial overlap with - but will not be identical to - the set\nof topics we actually talk about.)\nPossible World Semantics for Propositional Attitudes\nPossible Worlds\n3⁄4 Possible world: complete history of the entire universe, specifying every detail\nabout how everything happens.\n3⁄4 The actual world: the particular possible world that we are living in\nLewis (1986, quoted in H&K):\n3⁄4 A proposition: can be construed as a set of possible worlds\n(intuitively, the set of worlds where that proposition is true)\n3⁄4 This is parallel to treating a predicate such as red or smokes as a set of\nindividuals.\nRepresenting knowledge and desire states (for example):\n3⁄4 If we knew everything there was to know about the world (omniscient deity), we\nwould know which possible world was the actual one.\nBUT we don't, so we can only narrow down worlds to a set that are compatible\nwith what we know - i.e., which could be the actual one for all we know.\nSo we can construe \"what x knows\" as a set of possible worlds.\n3⁄4 Similarly, if we had very specific desires about how the world should be (a\ncontrol-freak deity?), then we could specify exactly which world we would like to\nbe in.\nBUT again our desires aren't this specific - for example, I might want to have\npizza for dinner tonight, but not particularly care whether it has olives on it or not.\n\nFeb. 3\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nSo we just narrow down the worlds to the set compatible with our desires (i.e.,\nworlds which would all be perfect as far as we are concerned.)\n3⁄4 Again: construe \"what x wants\" as a set of possible worlds.\nNote about mental states and propositions\n(Note that on this view a person's entire knowledge state (belief state, desire state, etc.) is\nrepresented as the same type of thing (set of worlds) as a sentence such as It's snowing.)\nTo help make sense of this, keep in mind that:\n3⁄4 There is a natural mapping from sets of propositions (sets of sets of worlds) to\nsets of worlds.\n3⁄4 Given a set of sets of worlds, e.g.:\nlet S = { {w1, w2, w3, w4}, {w2, w3, w4}, {w1, w2, w3} }\nWe can take the intersection of all of the member sets to get a set of worlds:\n∩ S = {w2, w3}\nAttitudes as sets of worlds\n3⁄4 Let Knowx = {w: w is compatible with what x knows}\n(the set of possible worlds compatible with what x knows, where x is an\nindividual)\nSimilarly:\n3⁄4 Believex = {w: w is compatible with what x believes}\n3⁄4 Wantx = {w: w is compatible with what x wants to be the case}\nCompositional semantics of attitude reports\n3⁄4 [[α]] = def the semantic value (meaning) of expression α\n3⁄4 Note, for a sentence S, [[S]] /a/ will be a proposition (set of worlds)\nSome general rules:\n3⁄4 [[x knows S]] = 1 [true] iff knowx ⊂ [[S]]\ni.e., x knows S is true iff every world compatible with what x knows is a world\nwhere S is true.\nSimilarly:\n3⁄4 [[x believes S]] = 1 iff believex ⊂ [[S]]\n3⁄4 [[x wants S]] = 1 iff wantx ⊂ [[S]]\n\nFeb. 3\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nPresupposition & Entailments\nFactive predicates:\n(1)\nSue knows that it's snowing.\n(2)\nSue doesn't know that it's snowing.\n(3)\nSue realized that it was snowing.\n(4)\nSue didn't realize that it was snowing.\nAll say something about Sue's mental state; but they also suggest that it is, in fact,\nsnowing.\n(5)\n# Sue knows that it's snowing, but it isn't.\n(6)\n# Sue realized that it was snowing, but it wasn't.\n3⁄4 [[ x realized S [at time t1 ] ]]\n=\n1 if [ S]] = 1 AND knowx ⊂ [ S]] before t1 and knowx ⊂ [ S]] at t1\n0 if [[ S]] = 1 AND knowx ⊂ [ S]] before t1 and knowx ⊂ [ S]] at t1\nundefined if [[S]] = 0 (or if knowx ⊂ [ S]] before t1\nundefined if [[S]] = 0\n[Some of this might come from what counts as \"knowledge\" in the first place]\n3⁄4 [[x knows S]]\nFirst pass:\n3⁄4 [[x knows S]]\n=\n1 if [ S]] = 1 AND knowx ⊂ [[S]]\n0 if [[ S]] = 1 AND knowx ⊂ [[S]]\n=\n1 if [ S]] = 1 AND knowx ⊂ [[S]]\n0 if [[ S]] = 1 AND knowx ⊂ [[S]]\nundefined if [[S]] = 0\nTense under Embedding\nTwo readings for embedded past tense in English:\n(7)\nSue said that was happy.\n(i)\nSue said, \"I'm happy\" [she said at t1 that she was happy at t1]\n(ii)\nSue said, \"I was happy\" [she said at t1 that she was happy at t0]\nReading (i) shows \"sequence of tense.\"\n\nFeb. 3\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nRussian embedded present\nRussian embedded tense (Schlenker 2003 citing Kondashov & Kondrashova, Kusumoto):\nExtra complication: it matters what the embedding predicate is:\n\"Double-access\" readings (English)\n(Abusch, 1988, 1991; Ogihara, 1995)\n(8)\nSam found out that Mary was pregnant.\n(Ogihara, 1995, no. 28)\n(9)\nSam found out that Mary is pregnant.\n(Ogihara, 1995, no. 27)\n[Mary must still be pregnant at the time of utterance]\nLogophors & Shifting Indexicals\nLogophors\n(West African type) Logophors: pronouns (typically 3rd-person) that ...\n3⁄4 Only occur in embedded contexts (under speech or attitude predicates)\n3⁄4 Always corefer with the reported speaker / attitude holder\nExample from Ewe (Clements 1975):\n\nFeb. 3\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nShifting Indexicals\nPronouns like 'I' (or 'you') which\n3⁄4 normally refer to the speaker (or hearer) of the utterance,\n3⁄4 when embedded, can refer to the reported speaker\nExample from Amharic (Schlenker 2003):\nlit. \"John says that I am a hero\"\n|\nQ. How do we know that this isn't just quotation?\nA. From examples with indirect questions (and others?):\n= 'I didn't hear him tell me \"bring what!\" '\n|\nSelf-Locating Attitudes\nSome attitudes seem to crucially involve the \"self\" in a way that will not be fully\nexpressible in terms of possible worlds. (We call these de se.)\nAmnesiac in the Library example\nThe Lingens / Stanford Library example (Perry, 1977: p. 492):\nThe point: when he realizes \"I'm in the Stanford Library,\" he has come to know\nsomething that he didn't know before, even though he already knew that Lingens was in\nthe Stanford library.\n\nFeb. 3\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nMessy Shopper example\n(Perry, 1979: p. 3):\nThe point:\n3⁄4 he came to believe something new that he hadn't already believed: I am making a\nmess.\n3⁄4 It's not enough for him to have come to believe John Perry is making a mess\n(unless he also believes I am John Perry)\nÆ the indexicality is irreducible\n[Similar examples involve a knowledgeable but lost hiker, a person attending a meeting\nwho loses track of time]\nObligatorily de se expressions:\nIt seems that certain expressions are obligatorily de se, including:\n3⁄4 logophors\n3⁄4 shifting indexicals\n3⁄4 PRO (subject of infinitive clauses)\nSyntactic topics\n[Syntactic topics will be determined, and I welcome input on particular syntactic\nphenomena, languages, etc. you would like to look at provided it relates to sentence\nembedding and/or propositional attitudes]\n3⁄4 CP Structure\n3⁄4 Control and Raising\nCommon Ground & Assertion\nGoal of Conversation (Idealized)\n3⁄4 A group of people in normal, \"information-sharing\" conversation are trying to get\ncloser to having the same beliefs.\nFirst pass (simplified version):\n3⁄4 Let's say that x, y, and z are in a conversation.\n3⁄4 Start with believex, believey, believez (sets of worlds compatible with what x, y,\nand z believe, respectively)\n\nFeb. 3\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n3⁄4 We can talk about the shared beliefs of x, y, and z as\nbelievex ∩ believey ∩ believez\n[let's call this believex+y+z]\n= {w: w is compatible with what x believes, w is compatible with what y believes,\nAND w is compatible with what z believes}\n3⁄4 Suppose x says \"it's snowing\" and y and z have no reason to think that x is lying\nor misinformed.\n3⁄4 Then their new shared beliefs will be become (roughly):\nbelievex+y+z ∩ [ it's snowing]]\n= believex+y+z ∩∩ { w: it's snowing in w}\n= {w: it's snowing in w and w is compatible with the initial beliefs of x, y, and, z}\nThings are actually more complex...\n3⁄4 In the above example, x, y, and z come to believe that it's snowing, but also come\nto believe that they all believe that it's snowing, and believe that they believe that\nthey believe that it's snowing, and so on.\n3⁄4 More generally, we will end up talking about not just shared beliefs but common\nbeliefs. A group G commonly believes p iff every member of G believes...\nthat p\nthat every member of G believes that p\nthat every member of G believes that every member of p believes that p\n... and so on ad infinitum\nWe'll call this the common ground.\nAn assertion (typical utterance of a declarative sentence) = a proposal to modify the\ncommon ground"

Chomsky 1995, Boeckx 2008)\nAn Experiencer DP in the main clause blocks movement to subject position.\n...]\nOK\nSUBJi PRED [CP ... ti\nSUBJi PRED EXP [CP ... ti ...]\n*\n\nJeremy Hartman\n24.910, Spring 2009\n- English subject-to-subject raising an exception, but in other languages, subject-to-\nsubject raising cannot cross an experiencer in the higher clause.\n- The experiencer blocks movement: an experiencer in the main clause makes raising\nimpossible.\nFrench\n(4)\na.\nIl\nsemble (au garcon) qu'elle a\ndu\ntalent. -\nNo raising.\nexpl. seems to.the boy that-she has of-the talent.\nExperiencer OK\n'It seems to the boy that she has talent.'\nb.\nElle semble (*au garcon) avoir du\ntalent.\n-\nRaising.\nShe seems\nto.the boy to.have of-the talent.\nExperiencer bad.\n'She seems to the boy to have talent.'\nItalian\n(5)\na.\nSembra (a Maria) che Gianni e stanco.\nseems to Maria that Gianni is tired\n-\n'It seems to Maria that Gianni is tired.'\nNo raising.\nExperiencer OK\nb.\nGianni sembra (*a Maria) essere stanco\nGianni seems\nto Maria to.be tired.\n-\n'Gianni seems to Maria to be tired.'\nRaising.\nExperiencer bad.\n- (a) examples: No movement across higher clause. Experiencer is permitted.\n- (b) examples: Movement across higher clause. Experiencer is prohibited.\n- (* It is a matter of some debate why this effect does not hold of English raising\nconstructions. I won't go into this here. But English will become important\nbelow.)\n3. Introducing ToughConstructions\n- An \"unsolved mystery\" in syntax for a long time.\nConsider the following sentences:\n(6)\na.\nMary is tough to please.\nb.\nJohn is easy to fool.\nc.\nThis test will be impossible to fail.\nd.\nMonsters are fun to draw.\ne.\nBill is depressing to listen to.\nf.\nThis book is important to read.\n.\n\nJeremy Hartman\n24.910, Spring 2009\n- What do they mean, intuitively?\n- The subject of the embedded clause is PROarb.\nWhat's intriguing about them?\n- Gap in the object position of the embedded clause. What is it? Is it a trace of\nmovement? Or some other empty category?\n- Apparent non-thematic subject of the main clause. Is it derived by movement?\n(7)\na.\nIt is tough to please Mary.\nb.\nIt is easy to fool John.\nc.\nIt will be impossible to fail this test.\nd.\nIt is fun to draw monsters.\ne.\nIt is depressing to listen to Bill.\nf.\nIt is important to read this book.\n(8)\na.\nJohn is easy to fool.\n#John is easy.\nb.\nThis test is difficult to fail.\nThis test is difficult.\nEtc.\n- The proper analysis of tough-constructions is a very open question!\nPossible analyses:\n- Derived-subject analysis\n- Movement from object position of embedded clause to subject position of main\nclause. A-movement, like subject-to-subject raising.\n___ is easy [CP PRO to please Mary]\n\nMaryi is easy [CP PRO to please ti ]\n- The earliest analyses of tough constructions (Rosenbaum 1967, Postal 1971)\n- Revived recently in \"two-step\" form (Brody 1993, Hornstein 2000, Hicks 2003)\nMaryi is easy [CP ti [TP PRO to please ti ]\n\nJeremy Hartman\n24.910, Spring 2009\n- Object deletion analysis\n- No movement. The subject is base-generated. Assimilates tough constructions to\nsentences like (9), where the object gap is assumed to be the result of obligatory\ndeletion under identity with the main subject.\n(9)\na.\nMary is beautiful to look at [e].\nb.\nJohn is too smart to fool [e].\nUnlike tough constructions, these have clearly thematic subjects.\n(10)\na.\n*It is beautiful to look at Mary\nb.\n*It is too smart to fool John.\n- An older analysis (Lasnik and Fiengo 1974, Akmajian 1972). Fallen out of favor.\n- Null Operator Analsysis.\n- The subject is base-generated. The object gap in the embedded clause is a trace\nbound by a null wh-operator:\nMaryi is easy [CP Opi [TP PRO to please ti]]\n- The 'classic' GB analysis of Chomsky (1977, 1981).\n- Assimilates tough-constructions to other cases of complex-predicates, e.g. relative\nclauses.\n(11)\na.\nJohn met [the woman I love].\nb.\nMary is [the woman to ask]\n- Same binding relationship between the gap and a null operator.\nthe girl [λx. I love x]\nTo recap:\n-\nObject deletion analysis\nNo movement. Subject is base-generated.\n-\nDerived-subject analysis\nMovement, crosses the main clause.\n-\nNull-operator analysis\nMovement, but doesn't cross the main clause. Subject is base-generated.\n\nJeremy Hartman\n24.910, Spring 2009\n4. Experiencers and Intervention Effects in ToughConstructions\n- The intervention effect can help us choose between the analyses.\n- To use the intervention effect to diagnose movement in toughconstructions, first we\nmust introduce an experiencer.\n- Both the expletive construction (a examples) and the movement construction (b\nexamples) can optionally take a \"for-DP\" sequence.\n(13)\na.\nIt is easy (for Mary) to please John.\nb.\nJohn is easy (for Mary) to please.\n(14)\na.\nIt will be hard (for the students) to fail the test.\nb.\nThe test will be hard (for the students) to fail.\nBut there is a structural ambiguity in these sentences!\nTwo \"for\"s in English:\n\"For\" the preposition\nThese flowers are [for Mary]\nMath is difficult [for John.]\n[For you,] I would do anything.\n\"For\" the complementizer\nI am eager [for Mary to win.]\n[For John to ace the test] would be surprising.\nI would hate [for you to have to wait a long time.]\n- The for-DP sequence (the \"for-phrase\") is potentially ambiguous between a PP\nexperiencer in the matrix clause (15) and a complementizer-subject sequence in the\nembedded clause (16).\n(15)\na.\nIt is easy [PP for Maryi] [PROi to talk to John]\nb.\nJohn is easy [PP for Maryi] [PROi to talk to___]\n(16)\na.\nIt is easy [CP for Mary to talk to John]\nb.\nJohn is easy [CP for Mary to talk to ___]\n- If the matrix subject is derived by movement, the structure in (15b) will constitute an\nenvironment for intervention by the experiencer.\n-\nHowever, any intervention effect would be impossible to detect from the examples\nexamples above, since the offending structure in (15b) is surface-identical to the\nbenign structure in (16b).\n\nJeremy Hartman\n24.910, Spring 2009\n- There are cases that can be used to resolve the ambiguity in favor of the structure in\n(15). The predictions for such cases are clear:\n-\nIf tough constructions involve a derived subject, then we should uncover an\nintervention effect. (The expletive construction should be grammatical and the tough\nconstruction should be ungrammatical.)\n- On the other hand, if tough constructions involve a matrix subject that is base-\ngenerated, then no intervention effect should be uncovered. (Both the expletive\nconstruction and the tough construction should be grammatical.)\nPREDICTIONS\nExpletive Construction\nToughconstruction\nNo Exp\nExp\nNo Exp\nExp\nObject deletion\nNulloperator\nDerived Subject\nLOOKING FOR EVIDENCE:\n4.1 Evidence from other prepositions in English\n- The ambiguity between (15) and (16) arises only because, in English, the preposition\nused to introduce experiencers is homophonous with the complementizer for.\n- Less frequently, other prepositions may be used to introduce experiencers:\n(17)\na.\nIt is important to John to avoid cholesterol.\nb.\nIt is annoying to the girls to make small-talk.\nc.\nIt was tough on me to lose my wife.\n- Since these prepositions are not homophonous with complementizers, a toDP or on\nDP sequence is unambiguously a PP, and the experiencer contained in it should block\ntough movement.\n- This is indeed the case: these prepositions are compatible with the expletive\nconstruction (a examples) but incompatible with the movement construction (b\nexamples).\n\nJeremy Hartman\n24.910, Spring 2009\n(18)\na.\nIt is important (to Mary) to avoid cholesterol.\nb.\nCholesterol is important (*to Mary) to avoid.\n(19)\na.\nIt is enjoyable (to John) eat strawberries.\nb.\nStrawberries are enjoyable (*to John) to eat.\n(20)\na.\nIt is annoying (to those boys) to talk to John.\nb.\nJohn is annoying (*to those boys) to talk to.\n(21)\na.\nIt was hard (on me) to give up sugar.\nb.\nSugar was hard (*on me) to give up.\nSUMMARY\nExpletive Construction\nTough-construction\nNo Exp\nExp\nNo Exp\nExp\nOK\nOK\nOK\nBAD\n4.2 Evidence from Romance\nA similar effect is observed when we examine tough constructions in French and Italian,\nlanguages in which the preposition used to introduce experiencers is never homophonous\nwith a complementizer.\n- Here, P-DP sequences are unambiguously PPs, so we predict that the DPs they\ncontain should act as interveners to tough movement.\n- This prediction is confirmed by the data. The experiencer is allowed in the expletive\nconstruction (a examples), but not in the tough construction (b examples):\n(22)\na.\nIl est difficile (pour les chiens) de voir cette couleur.\nFrench\nIt is difficult for the dogs DE see this color\n'It is difficult for dogs to see this color'\nb.\nCette couleur est difficile (*pour les chiens) a voir.\nThis color\nis difficult for\nthe dogs A see.\n'This color is difficult for dogs to see.'\n(23)\na.\nIl est difficile (pour les estudiants) de comprendre le probleme.\nIt is difficult for the students DE understand the problem\n'It is difficult for the students to understand the problem.'\nb.\nLe probleme est difficile (*pour les etudiants) a comprendre.\nThe problem is difficult for the students A understand.\n'The problem is difficult for the students to understand.'\n\nJeremy Hartman\n24.910, Spring 2009\n(24)\na.\nE difficile (per i\ncani) vedere questi colori.\nItalian\nIs difficult for the dogs see\nthese colors.\n'It is difficult for dogs to see these colors.'\nb.\nQuesti colori sono difficili (*per i\ncani) da vedere.\nThese colors are difficult for the dogs DA see.\n'These colors are difficult for dogs to see.'\n(25)\na.\nE impossibile (per gli studenti) capire\nquesti problemi.\nIs impossible for the students understand these problems.\n'It is impossible for the students to understand these problems.'\nb.\nQuesti problemi sono impossibili (*per gli studenti) da capire\nThese problems are\nimpossible for the students DA understand\n'These problems are impossible for the students to understand.'\nSUMMARY\nExpletive Construction\nTough-construction\nNo Exp\nExp\nNo Exp\nExp\nOK\nOK\nOK\nBAD\n4.3 Evidence from 2 forphrases\n- There is nothing semantically deviant about two for- phrases in the tough paradigm.\nThe expletive construction allows it:\n(26)\nIt is easy for the rich for the poor to do the work.\nIt is convenient for John for Mary to bring the wine.\n- Crucially, one of the for- phrases must be analyzed as a matrix-adjoined PP, and this\nshould block tough-movement.\n- We thus predict that the expletive construction, but not the movement construction,\nshould be compatible with two for- phrases.\nLet's test:\n\nJeremy Hartman\n24.910, Spring 2009\n(27)\na.\nIt is easy [PP for the rich] [CP for the poor to do the work]\nb.\n*The work is easy [PP for the rich] [CP for the poor to do __]\n(28)\na.\nIt is convenient [PP for John] [CP for Mary to bring the wine].\nb.\n*The wine is convenient [PP for John] [CP for Mary to bring __].\nSUMMARY\nExpletive Construction\nTough-construction\nNo Exp\nExp\nNo Exp\nExp\nOK\nOK\nOK\nBAD\nLesson:\nIntervention effects in tough-constructions diagnose movement across the main clause,\nand support the derived subject analysis over analyses that take the subject to be base-\ngenerated."

Introducing Intensional Semantics\nWe can set up a lot of the mechanics of an intensional semantics using a simplistic but\nuseful example of a fictional world.\n2.1.\nPreliminaries\n(1)\nA famous detective lives at 221B Baker Street.\n3⁄4 Extension of (1) at a given world w:\n[[a famous detective lives at 221B Baker Street]]w\n= 1 iff a famous detective lives at 221B Baker St. in w\n3⁄4 Intension of (1):\nλw' . a famous detective lives at 221B Baker St. in w'\n[We won't need to deal with the internal composition of (1).]\n(2)\nIn the world of Sherlock Holmes, a famous detective lives at 221B Baker Street.\n3⁄4 Assume in the world of S.H. is a sentential modifier\n3⁄4 We can give a semantics for this modifier using an intensional system.\nFor convenience, let's pretend that:\n3⁄4 w9 = the world depicted in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories about Sherlock\nHolmes\n3⁄4 w6 = the actual world\n\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n2.2.\nVersion I: \"The world of Sherlock Holmes\"\nInformal idea\nThe modifier signals that the sentence is to be evaluated at world w9 (the world of\nSherlock Holmes) rather than at the actual world\nMore formally:\n(3)\n[ In the world of Sherlock Holmes, φ]]w = [[φ]]w9\n[i.e., in the world of Sherlock Holmes, φ is true in any world w iff φ is true in w9.]\nMore compositionally:\n(4)\n[ In the world of Sherlock Holmes]]w = λp<s,t> . p(w9)\nEvaluating (2) at world w6:\n(5)\n[ In the world of Sherlock Holmes, a famous detective lives at 221B Baker\nStreet]]w6\n[the meaning of the modifier (at the actual world) applied to the proposition that there is a\nfamous detective at 221B Baker St.]\n= [[in the world of Sherlock Holmes]]w6\n( [λw . a famous detective lives at 221B Baker St. in w] )\n= [ λp<s,t> . p(w9) ] ( [λw . a famous detective lives at 221B Baker St. in w] )\n[substituting the argument for p]\n= [λw . a famous detective lives at 221B Baker St. in w] (w9)\n[substitute w9 for the variable w]\n= 1 iff a famous detective lives at 221B Baker St. in w9\n2.3.\nVersion II: The world of Sherlock Holmes as\npresented by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in world w\n3⁄4 A problem with the idea in 2.2:\nIt's a contingent fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the Sherlock Holmes\nstories the way he did.

For example, we don't know whether\nHolmes had an odd or even number of hairs on his head the day he met Watson\n(and in some sense Sir Arthur Conan Doyle doesn't know either!)\nSo:\n3⁄4 It makes more sense to talk about a set of worlds compatible with what is written\nin the Sherlock Holmes stories.\n3⁄4 Recall: it's still a contingent fact that they were written the way they are\n3⁄4 So the function sher should now yield a set of worlds:\nsher(w) = {w': w' is compatible with the world as depicted in the Sherlock\nHolmes stories as written in w}\nFinally:\n(8)\n[ In the world of Sherlock Holmes, φ]]w = 1 iff ∀w'∈sher(w), [[φ]]w' = 1\nAgain, more compositionally:\n(9)\n[ In the world of Sherlock Holmes, φ]]w = λp<s,t> . for all w'∈sher(w), p(w') = 1\n3.

This depends on whether we want to assume that if something\nhappens to be true in the actual world, then you know that it's compatible with\nyour knowledge\n3.1.3.

(In NOUS 13.)\n3⁄4 Chierchia (1989), Anaphora and Attitudes De Se.\n(In Bartsch, van Benthem, & van Emde Boas (eds.), Language in Context.\nThe key observation:\nThere are attitudes that cannot be captured in terms of sets of worlds.\nPut another way:\n3⁄4 There are situations where a person intuitively comes to believe \"something new\"\n(or have some other attitude towards \"something new\"), but where the set of\npossible worlds compatible with their \"before\" and \"after\" beliefs cannot be\ndistinguished from each other.\n1. Starting Point\n[a.k.a. linguistically oriented reconstruction of Lewis's Section I]\nLook at what can be the object of attitude predicates (using expect as an example):\n(1)\nI expect Bruce.\n(2)\nI expect a cat.\n(3)\nI expect winter.\n(4)\nI expect to shovel snow.\n(5)\nI expect that someday mankind will inhabit at least five planets.\n3⁄4 These vary syntactically...\nNPs: Bruce, a cat, winter,\nInfinitival clauses: to shovel snow\nCPs: that mankind will (someday) inhabit at least five planets\n3⁄4 ... and also semantically (at least on the face of it):\nindividual / season / etc.: Bruce, winter\n\nMar. 17\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nquantificational object: a cat\n(on the reading 'a cat, any cat')\nactivity: to shovel snow\nstate of affairs: that mankind will (someday) inhabit at least five planets\n3⁄4 Of course, things that look like individuals can be recast as clausal / propositional\ntype things:\nexpecting Bruce ≈ expecting Bruce to appear\nwanting a cat ≈ wanting (oneself) to have a cat\nneeding to shovel snow ≈ needing it to be the case that one shovels snow\nA General Question:\n3⁄4 Are all objects of attitude predicates the same kind of (abstract) object?\n3⁄4 Lewis's answer: Yes, but these things are not sets of worlds\n2. Examples of De Se Attitudes\n(6)\nMessy Shopper example (Perry 1979, p.3)\nCrucially: he came to believe something new: I am making a mess.\nNote: It's not enough for him to have come to believe John Perry is making a mess\n(unless he also believes I am John Perry)\n(7)\nThe Lingens / Stanford Library example (Perry 1977, p. 492):\nThe point: when he realizes \"I'm in the Stanford Library,\" he has come to know\nsomething that he didn't know before, even though he already knew that Lingens was in\nthe Stanford library.\n\nMar. 17\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n(8)\nThe \"two gods\" example (Lewis 1979, pp. 520-521)\nPart of the point here: each of these gods can place themselves in logical space, but they\ncannot place themselves in ordinary space.\nÆ That is, each god doesn't know whether he himself is located on the tallest mountain\nor on the coldest mountain (even though he knows everything there is to know about\nthese mountains)\nTerminological Remark\nThe term de se was (I believe) coined (by Lewis?) on analogy with the terms de dicto and\nde re, which are also used to distinguish different kinds of attitudes.\nExample of de re and de dicto beliefs (just for reference):\nSuppose that the man who lives upstairs happens to be the mayor's brother.\n[based on example in Partee 1974]\n(9)\nMary believes that the mayor's brother is insane.\n(i)\nOne reading [de re]: equivalent to (10)\n[Mary thinks to herself: \"That guy is insane.\"]\n(ii)\nAnother reading [de dicto]: not equivalent to (10)\n[Mary thinks to herself: \"The mayor's brother is insane.\"\n(10)\nMary believes that the man who lives upstairs is insane.\n3. Another Approach\nTwo notions of \"thinking the same thing\"\nScenario (based on Perry, 1977: pp. 489, 492):\nDeval Patrick is the governor of Massachusetts.\nDonald Carcieri is the governor of Rhode Island.\nPatrick thinks to himself: I am the governor of Massachusetts. [true]\nCarcieri thinks to himself: I am the governor of Massachusetts. [false]\nÆ There is a sense in which Patrick and Carcieri think the same thing; and there is also a\nsense in which they think different things.\n\nMar. 17\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n4. A Linguistic Perspective\nQ. But are de se attitudes actually expressed in language?\nA. Yes, at least in certain cases:\n(11)\nErnie Banks examples (Morgan 1970, pp. 380-381):\nWant:\n(12)\n[Context: Lingens, the amnesiac lost in the Stanford library, happens upon a book that tells a story\nof a man named Rudolf Lingens, who is lost in the Stanford library. Lingens feels sympathy for\nthe man he is reading about (after all, he is in a similar situation!), and says to himself, \"Poor guy,\nI hope he gets out of the library eventually.\" Of course, Lingens doesn't realize that the man he is\nreading about is himself.]\ni) # Lingens wants to get out of the Stanford library.\n[obligatorily de se]\nii) OK Lingens wants himself to get out of the Stanford library.\n[not obligatorily de se]\nItalian credere (Chierchia 1989):\n(13)\n[Context: Pavarotti hears an opera singer on the radio. The voice is beautiful, and Pavarotti thinks\nto himself, \"that man is a genius.\" He doesn't realize that the radio is playing a recording of\nPavarotti himself.]\ni) # Pavarotti crede\ndi essere un genio.\nPavarotti believes C be\na genius\n(Lit., \"Pavarotti believes to be a genius\")\n[obligatorily de se]\nii) OK Pavarotti crede\nche gli e un genio.\nPavarotti believes C he is a genius\n(Lit., \"Pavarotti believes that he's a genius\")\n[not obligatorily de se]\n\nMar. 17\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n5. Semantics for De Se Attitudes\n3⁄4 So far: we've talked about the set of worlds compatible with a person's beliefs (or\nknowledge, desires, etc.)\n3⁄4 New view: [at least for control constructions] talk about the set of world-\nindividual pairs <w,x> such that it's compatible with a person's beliefs (or\nknowledge, desires, etc.) that they themselves are x in w.\n3⁄4 A new / second lexical meaning for attitude predicates:\n(14)\nBel-DSx,w = {<w',y>: it's compatible with what x believes in w that x is y in w'}\n[[believeDS]]w = [λP<s,<e,t>> . [λx . ∀<w' ,y>∈Bel-DSx,w . P(w')(y)=1]\n(15)\nWant-DSx,w = {<w',y>: it's compatible with x's desires in w for x to is y in w'}\n[[wantDS]]w = [λP<s,<e,t>> . [λx . ∀<w' ,y>∈Want-DSx,w . P(w')(y)=1]\n3⁄4 Meaning for infinitival clauses:\n(16)\n[ PRO to be a genius]]w = [λx . x is a genius in w]\nintension of this:\n[λw' . [λx . x is a genius in w'] ]\n3⁄4 In effect: this means attitude predicates (in these cases) express a relationship\nbetween an individual and a property rather than an individual and a proposition.\nIn-class exercise\nCompute truth conditions for:\n(17)\nSue wants to be a genius.\nRemaining Issues:\n3⁄4 Treat attitude predicates as always taking properties, or have them take\npropositions in \"normal\" cases?\n3⁄4 Special de se readings of belief reports with finite clauses?"

Further Applications\n5.1.\nSemantics / pragmatics of questions\n1. [examples of normal information-seeking questions]\n2. Is it raining?\n3. How are you?\n4. Who's the governor of Iowa?\nOne standard view of the semantics of questions:\n3⁄4 The denotation of a question = the set of possible answers to the question (i.e., a\nset of propositions)\n(2\n{it's raining, it isn't raining}\n(3\n{The addressee is doing well, the addressee is doing okay, the\naddressee is doing terribly, ...}\n(4\n{Mitt Romney is the governor of Iowa, Barack Obama is the\ngovernor of Iowa, Chet Culver is the governor of Iowa, ...}\n3⁄4 Observations about questions:\nThe speaker believes that some member of the set is true\n[this seems to act like a presupposition]\nThe speaker believes that the addressee (might) know which one is true, and\nbe willing to tell the speaker\n3⁄4 Formally, given a question Q which denotes set A\nAsking Q does the following:\nAdds to the common ground that (at least) one member of A is true\n[presupposition]\nInvites the hearer to assert one of the members of Q\n3⁄4 Norm: For a speaker to appropriately ask question Q, where Q has the set of\npossible answers A, the following must hold:\nthe speaker can be expected to accept whichever assertion the hearer makes in\nresponse to the question\nthe hearers can be expected not to object to adding to the common ground the\nproposition that A has some member that's true\n3⁄4 Note: We don't have to add that the hearer should answer correctly, since this\nfalls under the norm of assertion\n5.2.\n(Indicative) Conditionals\n5. If it's raining, I'll take an umbrella.\n\nApr. 28\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nOne way to think of this: the speaker temporarily adds the proposition that it's raining to\nthe common ground, and proposes (in that new context) to add the proposition that the\nspeaker will take an umbrella.\n[After the assertion is over, the proposition that it's raining is taken back out of the\ncommon ground.]\nToy example:\n3⁄4 6 worlds in context set:\nw1: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw2: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw3: Rain; Speaker does not take umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw4: No rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw5: No rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw6: No rain; Speaker does not take umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\n3⁄4 Step 1: Remove non-rain worlds (w4, w5, w6) temporarily from the context set,\ngiving the following temporary context set:\nw1: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw2: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw3: Rain; Speaker does not take umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\n3⁄4 Step 2: Proposes to remove from this derived context set all of the worlds where\nthe speaker does not take an umbrella (namely, w3).\n3⁄4 If the assertion is accepted, we get a new derived context set:\nw1: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw2: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\n3⁄4 Add the non-rain worlds back in, giving the new context set:\nw1: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw2: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw4: No rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw5: No rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw6: No rain; Speaker does not take umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\n3⁄4 Result [if conditional is accepted]: we've removed from the context set worlds\nwhere it's raining and the speaker doesn't take an umbrella\nNote: This view of conditionals is highly influential but controversial, and many\n(perhaps most) linguistic semanticists take a different view.\n5.3.\nExclamations: Ouch, oops, etc.\nOne simple way to think of these: they are purely presuppositional - that is, add\nsomething to the common ground without giving the addressees a fair chance to reject it.\n(But in order to say one of these things, it must be the case that the hearers can be\nexpected not to object to adding it to the common ground.)\nOn this view:\n\nApr. 28\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n3⁄4 Ouch: presupposes that something has caused the speaker pain [etc.]\n3⁄4 Oops / Oh Sh*t! / etc.: presupposes that the speaker has made a mistake\n5.4.\nExpressive Content\nExamples: that bastard Sam, nonrestrictive relative clauses (maybe), the f**k-ing TV\n(and variations), ...\n6.\nThat bastard Sam got a new job.\nasserts that Sam got a new job\nAdds to the common ground that the speaker thinks Sam is a bastard\n7.\nTurn off the damn T.V.!\n= imperative expressing 'turn off the T.V.'\nAdds to the common ground that the speaker has a negative attitude towards\nthe T.V.\nTwo ways to think of these:\n3⁄4 They contain presuppositions about the speaker's attitude (for example 'the\nspeaker thinks that Sam is a bastard')\n3⁄4 They [??] put the speaker on record as wanting to add a \"judgment\" to the\ncommon ground (for example, 'Sam is a bastard') but presumes that the hearers\nwill not accept it. (Perhaps it gives hearers an opportunity to accept it.)\n5.5.\nOther conversational games: Guessing games\n8.\nThe prize might be in my right hand or it might be in my left hand. You have to\nguess!\n3⁄4 Assume:\n'Speaker believes the prize might be in their right hand'\n≈ 'it's compatible with the speaker's beliefs that the prize is in their right\nhand'\n[and similarly for the left hand]\n3⁄4 Also assume: If 'the prize might be in the speaker's right hand' is added to the\ncommon ground, what happens is that the interlocutors simply check to make sure\nthere are worlds in the context set where the prize is in the speaker's right hand\n[and similarly for left]\nReason this kind of example is puzzling: Presumably the speaker knows what hand the\nprize is in, and so they can't possibly believe both of these might statements.\nOne way to think of this situation: The norm of assertion is different for a clue-giver in a\nguessing game: In this case, to appropriately assert p, it must be the case that:\n3⁄4 Adding p to the common ground won't rule out the correct answer\n3⁄4 Adding p to the common ground won't give away the correct answer\n\nApr. 28\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nNote: Suppose the prize is in fact in the speaker's right hand. Then:\nThey can't assert the prize is in my right hand (even if they believe it to be\ntrue) because it will eliminate all the left-hand worlds (giving away the\nanswer)\nThey can't assert the prize is in my left hand because it will eliminate the\nactual world\n5.6.\nMore to think about ...\n3⁄4 Dismissive insults (Screw you!)\n3⁄4 \"Conventional implicatures\" [but Æ contrast]\n3⁄4 Conversational implicatures\n3⁄4 Relationship with Gricean maxims\n5.7.\n[Assignment]\nDiscuss the naturally occurring conversations from your homework.\n[Try to go through what happens to the common ground at each step.]\n\nApr. 28\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nPart II - Presupposition\nReadings:\n3⁄4 L.

[Cited in Stalnaker 2002.]\n3⁄4 Stalnaker, Robert (2002). Common Ground. Linguistics and Philosophy 25.\n1. Conversation\n1.1.\nConversations as a linguistic unit\n3⁄4 Intuitive notion: 2+ people talk with each other for some amount of time\nMore general notion (somewhat idealized): a 'conversation' involves:\n3⁄4 A group of people (interlocutors) who are all aware that they are participating in a\nconversation together\n3⁄4 Interlocutors make assertions, questions, answers, changes in topic, ...\n3⁄4 (in some sense) a coherent event separable from other conversations\nThough note: conversations can take place in discontinuous regions of space or\ntime. Consider:\nTelephone calls [interlocutors at different locations]\nWritten correspondence, online forums, ... [discontinuous times]\n[Even without technology/writing, people can shout, or talk with\ninterruptions]\n3⁄4 Forms of conversation can be conventionalized within a language community /\nculture:\nAccepted conversation starters\nWhat's going on with you lately? / We need to talk. / Can I bug you for a\nsecond? / Excuse me... / Do you have a minute for the environment?\nFormalized types of conversation:\nCourt testimony, lectures, news broadcasts, talk shows, blog comment threads,\nnovels, ...\n1.2.\nA totally mundane conversation:\n1. Sue:\nIs it raining out?\n\n[time t1]\nBill:\nYeah.\n\n[time t2]\nDo you want to borrow my umbrella?\n[time t3]\nSue:\n\nSure.\n\n[time\n\nt4]\nBy the end of this conversation, Sue and Bill can agree on a great number of things:\n3⁄4 that it's raining\nor at least... that they're both acting as if they're agreeing that it's raining\n\nApr. 14\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nBut also:\n3⁄4 That a conversation took place between them:\nAt t1, Sue said to Bill \"Is it raining out?\"\nAt t2, Bill said to Sue, \"Yeah\"\n... [and so on]\n3⁄4 That at t1, Sue:\ndidn't know whether it was raining *\nwas inviting Bill to tell her whether it was raining\nhad reason to believe that Bill could tell her whether it was raining*\n[* or at least is acting as if this is the case]\n3⁄4 At t2, Bill:\nbelieved that it was raining\nwanted Sue to know that it was raining\nexpected Sue to come to believe that it was raining by hearing his answer\nBUT - suppose Bill is lying. Then we need to say:\n3⁄4 [revised] At t2, Bill wanted Sue to believe:\nthat it was raining\nthat he (Bill) believed that it was raining\nthat he (Bill) wanted Sue to also know that it was raining\nthat he (Bill) expected Sue to come to believe that it was raining by hearing\nhis answer\n3⁄4 BUT - now suppose that Bill doesn't really think Sue will believe him. Then we\nneed to say something like this:\n3⁄4 [revised] At t2, Bill wanted to show that his intention was to make Sue believe:\nthat it was raining\nthat he (Bill) believed that it was raining\nthat he (Bill) wanted Sue to also know that it was raining\nthat he (Bill) expected Sue to come to believe that it was raining by hearing\nhis answer\n[using this more general form...]\n3⁄4 At t3, Bill behaved (by saying, \"do you want to borrow my umbrella?\") in a way\nthat he knew would be understood as intending to make Sue believe:\nthat he was inviting Sue to tell him whether she wanted to borrow his\numbrella\nthat he would give her permission to borrow his umbrella if she answered with\n\"yes\"\n3⁄4 At t2 and later, both Bill and Sue are behaving in a way that they know will be\nunderstood to each other as intending to show that they believe it's raining\n\nApr. 14\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n1.3.\nCommon Belief\nA useful notion (not to be confused with folkloric belief):\n3⁄4 Bill and Sue's common beliefs are the propositions p such that the following\nholds:\nBill believes p\nSue\n\nbelieves\n\np\n\nBill believes that they both believe that p\nSue believes that they both believe that p\nBill believes that they both believe that they both believe that p\nSue believes that they both believe that they both believe that p\n... and so on ad infinitum\nNote: This term is used in contrast to 'shared beliefs.'\nBill and Sue's shared beliefs are the propositions p such that\nBill believes p\nAND\nSue believes p\n3⁄4 Put differently: p is commonly believed by Bill and Sue iff:\nBill believes that p\nSue believes that p\nBill believes that Bill believes that p\nBill believes that Sue believes that p\nSue believes that Bill believes that p\nSue believes that Sue believes that p\nBill believes that Bill believes that Bill believes that p\nBill believes that Bill believes that Sue believes that p\nBill believes that Sue believes that Bill believes that p\nBill believes that Sue believes that Sue believes that p\nSue believes that Bill believes that Bill believes that p\nSue believes that Bill believes that Sue believes that p\nSue believes that Sue believes that Bill believes that p\nSue believes that Sue believes that Sue believes that p\n... [and so on ad infinitum]\nSomewhat more formally:\n2. p is among Bill and Sue's common beliefs iff every sentence in set A is true, where A\nis defined recursively as follows:\np ∈ A\nFor any φ: if φ∈A, then \"Bill believes that φ\"∈A\nFor any φ: if φ∈A, then \"Sue believes that φ\"∈A\n\nApr. 14\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nExercise (see assignment for next week): Extend the definition of common belief given in\n2 (or another version that is similarly formal) to any group of n individuals x1 ... xn.\n1.4.\nRelated Attitudes\nOf course, other group attitudes can be defined similarly:\n3⁄4 Common Knowledge: defined as for common belief\n[Left as an Exercise]\n[Again, not to be confused with 'common knowledge' in the sense of things that\neveryone should know - though the technical use is closely related to the informal\nuse]\n3⁄4 Shared Knowledge: defined as for shared belief (p is part of a group G's shared\nknowledge iff it is known by each member of G)\n3⁄4 Acceptance: Attitude of treating a proposition as true / taking for granted (for\nexample, for the purpose of conversation, argument, etc.) regardless of whether\none believes it.\n2. Common Ground and Context Set\nIntuitively: the facts/propositions that are taken for granted by a group of interlocutors in\na conversation.\nSome propositions that are in the common ground in our current conversation (i.e., our\nclass session being held by an instructor and students):\nWe're in a class at MIT\nIt's April 2009\nThe students in this class had papers due today\n...\nSome notes and history:\n3⁄4 terms 'common ground' and 'context set' associated most closely with Stalnaker\n3⁄4 Stalnaker attributes 'common ground' as used in philosophy of language to Grice\n(who seemed to be using it in a way closely related to its everyday use)\n3⁄4 The two terms get mixed up a lot, but I'll try to keep them straight.\nCommon ground = set of propositions\nContext set = set of worlds (those compatible with the common ground)\n2.1.\nDefinitions of 'Common Ground'\nSimple definition of common ground:\n3. Common Ground (v1): The common ground for a conversation (at time t) is the set\nof propositions commonly believed by the interlocutors in the conversation at t.\n\nApr. 14\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nVarious more complex versions: here's the one from Stalnaker 2002:\n4. Common Ground (v2): The common ground for a conversation (at time t) is the set\nof propositions p such that the interlocutors of the conversation commonly believe\nthat the group accepts p.\nFor example, p is in Bill and Sue's common ground iff:\nBill accepts p [for the purposes of the conversation]\nSue accepts p [for the purposes of the conversation]\nBill believes that Bill accepts p\nBill believes that Sue accepts p\nSue believes that Bill accepts p\nSue believes that Sue accepts p\n\nBill believes that Bill believes that Bill accepts p\nBill believes that Bill believes that Sue accepts p\nBill believes that Sue believes that Bill accepts p\nBill believes that Sue believes that Sue accepts p\nSue believes that Bill believes that Bill accepts p\nSue believes that Bill believes that Sue accepts p\nSue believes that Sue believes that Bill accepts p\nSue believes that Sue believes that Sue accepts p\n...\nNote:\nQ. Why not just 'common acceptance'?\nA. (Stalnaker 2002): Everyone in the group must actually realize that they are\naccepting the propositions, not just pretend that they are.\n2.2.\nContext Set\nContext set = the set of worlds compatible with the common ground\ni.e. the intersection of all the propositions in the common ground\n3⁄4 So note: The following three things are effectively the same:\nAdding p to the common ground\nIntersecting p with the context set\nRemoving from the context set all worlds in which p is not true\n2.3.\nSome simplifications\nStrictly speaking, if the proposition 'it's raining' is in the common ground, then the\nfollowing propositions will also enter the common ground:\nthe interlocutors all accept that it's raining\nthe interlocutors believe that they all accept that it's raining\n...\n[roughly, it's common ground that it's common ground that it's raining]\n\nApr. 14\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n[Note: for many purposes, we can ignore the higher order belief statements here, and just\nsay that 'it's raining' is in the common ground]\n3. Assertion\n\"Assertion\" ≈ what we do with typical declarative utterances:\n3⁄4 An assertion that p is a proposal to add p to the common ground.\nFor example: Saying \"it's raining\" = making a proposal to add to the common\nground that it's raining [equivalently, to remove from the context set all worlds in\nwhich it's not raining at the utterance time]\n3⁄4 Addressees have the option to accept or reject this proposal by saying or doing\nvarious things\nSaying nothing (often taken to be tacit acceptance)\n\"No\" / \"Nuh-uh!\" / \"No it isn't!\" / \" That's not true!\" / \"Bullshit!\" / \"How\ndo you know?!\" / \"Come on!\" (rejection)\nYeah, whatever... (perhaps: indicates acceptance purely to avoid further\ndiscussion)\nExasperated sigh (rejection?)\n3⁄4 If an assertion that p is rejected, a number of things still become common ground:\nthat the assertion took place\nthat the speaker believes (or accepts?) that p\n(presumably) that the assertion was rejected\n3⁄4 Norm of assertion: For a speaker to (acceptably, cooperatively, ...) assert that p,\nthey must believe that p.\nAlternatively:\nThe speaker must have sufficient evidence for p\nThe speaker must be willing to defend the truth of p\n... [various versions adopted]\n3⁄4 Lies: violate this norm, but couldn't be effective unless it was common ground\nthat this norm is place.\n3⁄4 Note: The speaker does NOT necessarily need to believe or expect that the\nproposal will be accepted:\n\"I know you're not going to believe me, but ...\"\n[sets up expectation that assertion will be rejected]\n\"OMG, I look so fat in these pants!\"\n[hoping for assertion to be rejected]\n\"You're an idiot!\"\n[presumably the addressee won't agree]\nStalnaker's analogy: \"Congress may make a law knowing it will be vetoed, a\nlabor negotiator may make a proposal knowing it will be met by a\ncounterproposal, or a poker player may place a bet knowing it will cause all the\nother players to fold\" (Stalnaker, 1978, p. 153)\n\nApr. 14\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n4. Presupposition\n[Note: Presupposition is really what drove the development of formal pragmatics, but in\nfact this is probably where there are still the most unanswered questions]\n3⁄4 Additional norm of assertion: If a sentence S presupposes a proposition q, then to\nassert S, q must be in the common ground\nExample:\n5.\nThe king of France is bald.\nPresupposes: France has a king (and only one)\nAsserts: He's bald\nIn terms of common ground, we can say that for a speaker to appropriately assert 5, the\nfollowing must hold:\n'France has exactly one king' is in the common ground\nThe speaker believes that the one king of France is bald\n3⁄4 Complication: Accommodation\n6.\nI need to pick up my brother at the airport.\n[may not already be common ground that I have a brother]\n3⁄4 The standard story: Under certain circumstances, hearers can be expected to\n\"accommodate\" presuppositions, in particular if they have no reason to doubt that\nthe speaker knows the presupposition is true\n3⁄4 Note: We don't want to say that 6 asserts that the speaker has a brother, because\nhearers who want to reject that proposition have to do something different than\nthey do if they want to reject the proposition that the speaker has to pick him up at\nthe airport:\n7.\n[In response to 6]\na) Hey, wait a minute! You never told me you had a brother!\nb) No you don't! He can take the train.\nAnother way to put this view of presupposition [I'm not sure if anyone has actually\nproposed this]:\n8.\nIf S presupposes p and entails q, then an assertion of S simply adds p to the\ncommon ground (slips it in, as it were). Then it further proposes to add q to the\ncommon ground, giving hearers a fair chance to reject it.\nWe could put this in terms of a revised norm of assertion:\n3⁄4 To assert a sentence S that presupposes p and entails q, the following must hold:\nThe speaker believes that p\nThe speaker believes that q\nThe hearers can be expected not to object to adding p to the common ground\n[This will, of course, be the case if p already is in the common ground]\n\nApr. 14\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n5. Further Applications\n5.1.\nSemantics / pragmatics of questions\n9. [examples of normal information-seeking questions]\na) Is it raining?\nb) How are you?\nc) Who's the governor of Iowa?\nOne standard view of the semantics of questions:\n3⁄4 The denotation of a question = the set of possible answers to the question (i.e., a\nset of propositions)\n(a)\n{it's raining, it isn't raining}\n(b)\n{The addressee is doing well, the addressee is doing okay, the\naddressee is doing terribly, ...}\n(c)\n{Mitt Romney is the governor of Iowa, Barack Obama is the\ngovernor of Iowa, Chet Culver is the governor of Iowa, ...}\n3⁄4 Observations about questions:\nThe speaker believes that some member of the set is true\n[this seems to act like a presupposition]\nThe speaker believes that the addressee (might) know which one is true, and\nbe willing to tell the speaker\n3⁄4 Formally, given a question Q which denotes set A\nAsking Q does the following:\nAdds to the common ground that (at least) one member of A is true\n[presupposition]\nInvites the hearer to assert one of the members of Q\n3⁄4 Norm: For a speaker to appropriately ask question Q, where Q has the set of\npossible answers A, the following must hold:\nthe speaker can be expected to accept whichever assertion the hearer makes in\nresponse to the question\nthe hearers can be expected not to object to adding to the common ground the\nproposition that A has some member that's true\n3⁄4 Note: We don't have to add that the hearer should answer correctly, since this\nfalls under the norm of assertion\n5.2.\n(Indicative) Conditionals\n10. If it's raining, I'll take an umbrella.\nOne way to think of this: the speaker temporarily adds the proposition that it's raining to\nthe common ground, and proposes (in that new context) to add the proposition that the\nspeaker will take an umbrella.\n\nApr. 14\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n[After the assertion is over, the proposition that it's raining is taken back out of the\ncommon ground.]\nToy example:\n3⁄4 6 worlds in context set:\nw1: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw2: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw3: Rain; Speaker does not take umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw4: No rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw5: No rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw6: No rain; Speaker does not take umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\n3⁄4 Step 1: Remove non-rain worlds (w4, w5, w6) temporarily from the context set,\ngiving the following temporary context set:\nw1: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw2: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw3: Rain; Speaker does not take umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\n3⁄4 Step 2: Proposes to remove from this derived context set all of the worlds where\nthe speaker does not take an umbrella (namely, w3).\n3⁄4 If the assertion is accepted, we get a new derived context set:\nw1: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw2: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\n3⁄4 Add the non-rain worlds back in, giving the new context set:\nw1: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw2: Rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw4: No rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is blown inside-out\nw5: No rain; Speaker takes umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\nw6: No rain; Speaker does not take umbrella; Umbrella is not blown inside-out\n3⁄4 Result [if conditional is accepted]: we've removed from the context set worlds\nwhere it's raining and the speaker doesn't take an umbrella\nNote: This view of conditionals is highly influential but controversial, and many\n(perhaps most) linguistic semanticists take a different view."

(Other presuppositions project.)\n[Note: no asymmetry, though Karttunen tries to make it parallel to the others]\n14.\na)\nJack has no children.\n[contradicts: Jack has children.]\nb)\nAll of Jack's children are boys.\n~> Jack has children\n15.\nEither Jack has no children or all of his children are boys.\n~/> Jack has children\n16.\nEither all of Jack's children are boys or he has no children.\n~/> Jack has children\n1.4.\nFurther complications\nIn some cases, \"entailment\" should be taken to be a broader relation:\n[Background: Fred believes that all Mormons wear special \"holy underwear\"]\n17.\nEither Geraldine is not a Mormon or she has given up wearing her holy\nunderwear\n~> If Geraldine is a Mormon, she wears / wore holy underwear\nÆ This is one argument for a more pragmatic view of presupposition\n[since these kinds of background assumptions shouldn't be in the semantic theory]\n2. Stalnaker on Pragmatic Presupposition\n3⁄4 Stalnaker, 1974. 'Pragmatic Presuppositions.'\n2.1.\nSome initial points:\n3⁄4 Giving a pragmatic explanation of presupposition does not have to mean giving\nan informal explanation - we just need a formal pragmatic theory.\n3⁄4 Some pragmatic view of presupposition is necessary anyway:\nEven if presupposition is a semantic notion, we still have to explain why\npresuppositions need to be background beliefs [see, e.g., p. 53]\n3⁄4 Certain inferences could potentially be both presuppositions AND entailments\n(e.g., factive verbs)\n3⁄4 We can give default definitions of \"assertion,\" \"presupposition,\" etc. in terms of\nbelief, etc. even though there are cases that deviate from this.\nFor example: Asserting something that's already common ground\n\nMay 5\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n\"Windy out, isn't it?\"\n[Interlocutors are acting as if it weren't already common ground so as to have\nsomething to say]\nOr: Presupposing something in order to convey it indirectly:\nA: The new guy is really good looking.\nB: Yeah, his wife is gorgeous, too.\n[B is pretending that A already knows that the new guy is married in order to de-\nemphasize the fact that B is telling A that the new guy is married and/or make it\nless obvious that B realized what A was getting at when she said he was\nhandsome.]\n2.2.\nThe flavor of a Stalnakerian explanation:\n[Stalnaker uses examples based on Karttunen's]\nExample 1: Different kinds of factive verbs: regret, realize, discover\nObservation: Factivity can vary based on apparently non-grammatical factors:\n18.\nIf I regret later that I have not told the truth, I will confess it to everyone.\n~> I have not told the truth\n19.\nDid you regret that you had not told the truth?\n~> You had not told the truth\n20.\nIf I realize later that I have not told the truth, I will confess it to everyone.\n~/> I have not told the truth\n21.\nDid you realize that you had not told the truth?\n~> You had not told the truth\n22.\nIf I discover later that I have not told the truth, I will confess it to everyone.\n~/> I have not told the truth\n23.\nDid you discover that you had not told the truth?\n~/> You had not told the truth\nregret realize discover\n~> p ?\nthat p\n1st person\n+\n-\n-\n2nd person\n+\n+\n-\n\nMay 5\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nExplanation of (20) (for example):\n3⁄4 Assumption 1: x realizes that p entails 2 things:\np\nx comes to believe that p\n3⁄4 Assumption 2: By default, we expect the \"belief\" part to be the main point of the\nutterance (so that the factive entailment should be presupposed)\n3⁄4 The if-clause temporarily adds to common ground, but also indicates that this is\nnot already a background belief:\nthe speaker did not tell the truth\nthe speaker comes to believe that they didn't tell the truth\n3⁄4 If this is not already a background belief, then one of the following must hold:\n(i) the speaker does not know whether they told the truth\nor (ii) the speaker has not come to believe that they didn't tell the truth\nBut if (ii) holds, then (i) must hold as well.\nCompare (21):\n3⁄4 The if-clause temporarily adds to common ground, but also indicates that this is\nnot already a background belief:\nthe addressee did not tell the truth\nthe addressee comes to believe that they didn't tell the truth\n3⁄4 If this is not already a background belief, then one of the following should hold:\n(i) the speaker does not know whether the addressee told the truth\nor (ii) the addressee has not come to believe that they didn't tell the truth\nIn this case (ii) can hold without (i) holding.\nExample 2: Asymmetry in conjunction\n24.\nBill has children and all of his children are girls.\n~/> Bill has children\n25.\n# All of Bill's children are girls and he has children.\n[Stalnaker doesn't talk about these specific examples, but I take it this is approximately\nwhat he would say]\n3⁄4 Assumption: If you assert a conjunction, you assert each conjunct\n3⁄4 In (24): The speaker has made it a background belief that Bill has children by\nasserting the first conjunct, Bill has children.\n\nMay 5\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n3⁄4 In (25): For the first conjunct to be assertable, it must (normally) already be\nbackground belief that Bill has children.\nIf it IS initial background belief that Bill has children: no point going on to assert\nthe 2nd conjunct.\nIf it is NOT initial background belief that Bill has children: first conjunct is\nalready odd.\n3⁄4 Important note / assumption: If someone asserted All of Bill's children are girls\nwhen there is no background belief about Bill having children, it's possible that\nthe interlocutors will choose to pretend as if that background belief were there -\nbut they won't pretend it's there and then immediately pretend it's not there after\nall.\n\nMay 5\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nPart II - Presupposition and Embedding Verbs\n3. Simons on Embedding Verbs\n3.1.\nYour examples\nDiscuss (at least a few of your favorites):\n3⁄4 How can you tell what is the \"main point\" of the utterance?\n(Evidence from general context, earlier statements, etc.)\n3⁄4 Is the speaker committed to the truth of the embedded proposition?\n3⁄4 What does the embedding verb tell us about the speaker's evidence for or against\nthe embedded proposition?\n3.2.\nSyntactically parenthetical cases\nCertain proposition-embedding predicates can be displaced:\n26.\n[Someone asks: Where was Louise yesterday?]\na)\nLouise was with Bill, I believe.\nb)\n\n...\n\nI\n\nsurmise.\n\nc)\n\n...\n\nI heard.\nd)\n...\n\nI guess.\n[see note]\ne)\nLouise was with Bill, Henry said.\nf)\n\n...\n\nHenry hinted.\ng)\n\n...\n\nHenry said.\nh)\n\n...\n\nHenry told me.\ni)\nLouise, Henry said, was with Bill.1\nj)\nLouse, Henry told me, was with Bill.\n[etc.]\nThis corresponds somewhat with:\n3⁄4 Use in the simple present\n3⁄4 Second, less specific meaning (e.g., for guess)\n3⁄4 Tendency towards having no overt complementizer (that)\n27.\n[Someone asks: Where was Louise yesterday?]\na)\nI hear Louise was with Bill.\nb)\nI guess Louise was with Bill.\n[≈ I'm assuming / concluding this; = I'm making a guess]\nc)\n?? I guess that Louise was with Bill.\n[≈ I'm assuming / concluding this; = I'm making a guess]\n1 (26.i) and (26.j) may be more natural as answers to a question like Where were Louise and Sue yesterday,\nsince this gives a reason to use (and put some stress on) Louise's name.\n\nMay 5\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nObservation: This is not possible with all proposition-embedding predicates:\n28.\n[Someone asks: Where were Louise and Sue yesterday?]\na)\nI believe that Louise was with Bill.\nb)\nLouise was with Bill, I believe.\n29.\na)\nLouise e-mailed me that she was with Bill.\nb)\n?? Louse was with Bill, she e-mailed me.\nObservation: Certain adverbs are not possible in the \"displaced\" cases:\n30.\n[Someone asks: Where was Louise yesterday?]\na)\nI'm afraid she was with Bill.\nb)\nShe was with Bill, I'm afraid.\n31.\na)\nI'm really afraid that she was with Bill.\nb)\n?? She was with Bill, I'm really afraid.\nPrevious proposals\n3⁄4 \"Embedded\" sentence is what is said / asserted / the main point\n3⁄4 Parenthetical speech/attitude clause behaves as an evidential or speaker-level\nadverbial (much like frankly, fortunately, ...)\n3⁄4 Background assumption: This is actually part of the grammar (syntax / semantics)\nof these constructions\n3.3.\nSimons's cases\nSimons's observation: Even outside of these constructions, most speech/attitude\npredicates can be used in this way (where the embedded proposition is the \"main point\"):\n32.\n[Someone asks: Where was Louise yesterday?]\na)\nI believe she was with Bill.\nb)\nI heard she was with Bill.\nc)\nHenry said she was with Bill.\nd)\nHenry told me she was with Bill.\n[etc.]\nSimons's point: there could be a grammatically \"parenthetical\" use of certain speech /\nattitude phrases, but these other cases must still be explained pragmatically.\n\nMay 5\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n3.4.\n(Possible) General Conclusions\n3⁄4 Separate pragmatic functions from specific grammatical forms\n[e.g., declarative tense morphology typically corresponds to asserted propositions,\nbut not always]\n3⁄4 A more general notion of \"assertion\" as \"putting proposition on the table\" for\nconsideration. Depending on the context and/or adverbs, evidentials, etc., it could\nbe understood that:\nThe speaker has good evidence for the proposition and would like the hearers\nto add it to the common ground\nIt's understood that the speaker has some evidence for the proposition and\nwants the hearers to consider adding it to the common ground\nThe speaker has evidence against the proposition and wants to make sure it's\nnot added to the common ground.\n3.5.\nBig Questions\n3⁄4 Constraining the pragmatics\n3⁄4 Figuring out what the role is of declarative morphology, truly parenthetical\nattitude phrases, etc.\n3⁄4 Prediction: If presupposition is truly purely pragmatic, then there shouldn't be two\nlexical items in any language that differ only in their presuppositions. Is this true?\n3⁄4 Always keep in mind: Things we call \"presuppositions\" may not all really be the\nsame kind of thing. Some could be purely pragmatic, others not.\n4. Our Pragmatic Tool Box\nSome key pragmatic concepts we've talked about:\n3⁄4 Common Ground: The set of propositions taken for granted by a group of people\nin a conversation\n3⁄4 Context set: The set of worlds compatible with the common ground (= the\nintersection of the propositions in the common ground)\n3⁄4 Conversational moves:\nAssertion (traditional view): proposal to add proposition to common ground\nAssertion / \"Putting forward\" (alternative view2): mentioning a proposition as\na possibility (something that could potentially be added to the common\nground), where other parts of the context / sentence indicating whether the\nspeaker is trying to actually add it.\n2 Simons is suggesting something along these lines. Work on so-called evidentials also often takes this kind\nof line, sometimes in a somewhat informal way.\n\nMay 5\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nSupposition: temporarily adding proposition to common ground, then\nremoving it after the conversational move is over (as in Stalnaker's view of\nconditionals).\nPresupposition (traditional view): Taking it for granted that a proposition\nholds (and that interlocutors are taking this for granted as well).\nPresupposition (alternative view3): Adding a proposition to the common\nground without the mediating step of proposing it (i.e., without giving hearers\na chance to object)\nQuestion asking: Inviting addressee to assert one of a set of propositions\n3⁄4 Rules of the Game: \"Norms\"\nNorm of assertion (traditional view): Speaker must believe the asserted\nproposition\nNorm of supposition: Speaker must believe that the proposition is NOT\nalready taken for granted\nNorm of presupposition (traditional view 1): Speaker must believe that\ninterlocutors take the proposition for granted\nNorm of presupposition (traditional view 2): Speaker must believe that\ninterlocutors can be reasonably expected to take the proposition for granted\n(once it's clear that they should) [perhaps derivable from version 1]\nNorm of presupposition (alternative view3): Speaker must believe that\ninterlocutors will have no reason to object to adding the proposition to the\ncommon ground\nNorm of question asking: Speaker must generally be willing to accept the\nresponding assertion of the addressee\n3 This is the view I suggested in class on April 14. I don't mean to take credit for it - it's in the spirit of\nsome of the 'pragmatic' views we've looked at and may have been proposed, but I'm not sure where."

From Last Time:\nIntroducing Intensional Semantics [Summary]\nWe can set up a lot of the mechanics of an intensional semantics using a simplistic but\nuseful example of a fictional world.\n1.1.\nVersion I: \"The world of Sherlock Holmes\"\nInformal idea\nThe modifier signals that the sentence is to be evaluated at a particular world - say,\nw9 (the world of Sherlock Holmes) - rather than at the actual world\nMore formally:\n(1)\n[ In the world of Sherlock Holmes, φ]]w = [[φ]]w9\n[i.e., in the world of Sherlock Holmes, φ is true in any world w iff φ is true in w9.]\n(2)\n[ In the world of Sherlock Holmes]]w = λp<s,t> . p(w9)\n1.2.\nVersion II: The world of Sherlock Holmes as\npresented by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in world w\n3⁄4 A problem with the idea in 1.1:\nIt's a contingent fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the Sherlock Holmes\nstories the way he did. He might have (in some other world) set things up so that\nSherlock Holmes lived on Abbey Rd (and no detective lived on Baker St.)\n(3)\n[ In the world of Sherlock Holmes, φ]]w = [[φ]]sher(w)\n(4)\n[ In the world of Sherlock Holmes, φ]]w = λp<s,t> . p(sher(w))\n= λp<s,t> . the world w' as it is described in the Sherlock Holmes stories as written\nin w is such that p(w') = 1\n1.3.\nVersion III: The set of worlds compatible with what is\npresented by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in world w\n3⁄4 A problem with the idea in 1.2: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle didn't actually make\nevery aspect of his fictional world explicit. For example, we don't know whether\nHolmes had an odd or even number of hairs on his head the day he met Watson\n(and in some sense Sir Arthur Conan Doyle doesn't know either!)\n(5)\n[ In the world of Sherlock Holmes, φ]]w = 1 iff ∀w'∈sher(w), [[φ]]w' = 1\n(6)\n[ In the world of Sherlock Holmes, φ]]w = λp<s,t> . for all w'∈sher(w), p(w') = 1\n\nFeb. 24\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n2. Semantics of Attitude Predicates\n2.1.\nThe Idea\nRecall: the function sher:\n3⁄4 sher(w) = {w': w' is compatible with the world depicted in the Sherlock Holmes\nstories, as written in w}\nWe can define a similar function for a person's beliefs (and other attitudes):\n(7)\nBelx, w = {w': w' is compatible with what x believes in w}\n[Note: We haven't said much of anything about what it means to be \"compatible with\nwhat x believes\" - more on this later.]\n2.2.\nLexical Entries\nUsing functions of this kind:\n(8)\n[ x believes φ]]w = 1 iff ∀w'∈Belx,w : [[φ]]w' = 1\nBreaking it down:\n(9)\n[ believe]]w = λp<s,t> . λxe . ∀w'∈Belx,w : p(w') = 1\n= λp<s,t> . λxe . ∀w': w' is compatible with what x believes in w: p(w') = 1\n(10)\n[ think]]w = [[believe]]w\nOf course, we can do something parallel for other attitudes:\n(11)\n[ know]]w = λp<s,t> . λxe . ∀w': w' is compatible with what x knows in w: p(w') = 1\n(12)\n[ suspect]]w\n= λp<s,t> . λxe . ∀w': w' is compatible with what x suspects in w: p(w') = 1\n(13)\n[[imagine]]w\n= λp<s,t> . λxe . ∀w': w' is compatible with what x imagines in w: p(w') = 1\n(14)\n[[want]]w = λp<s,t> . λxe . ∀w': w' is compatible with what x wants in w: p(w') = 1\nObviously this doesn't tell us much about the lexical semantics ...\n2.3.\nGetting the Types Right\nThe attitude predicates above have semantic type < <s,t>, <e,t> >\nIf we write the semantics for a sentence like this:\n3⁄4 [ It's raining]]w = 1 iff it's raining in w\nThen this is technically the wrong type (type t, rather than type <s,t>)\nTo fix this [one simple option]:\n3⁄4 Stipulate that expressions can freely shift to their intensions:\n3⁄4 The intension of α is the function λw' . [[α]]w'\n\nFeb. 24\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n2.4.\nExercises\nCompute the truth conditions of (15) at a particular world w1:\n(15)\nSue thinks that it's raining.\n3⁄4 Note: (that) it's raining will have to shift to its intension:\nInstead of [[it's raining]]w = 1 iff it's raining in w\nWe use: λw\" . it's raining in w\"\n3⁄4 [[(15)]]w1 = [[think]]w1 ( [λw' . [[it's raining]]w'] ) ( [[Sue]]w1 )\n= [λp<s,t> . λxe . ∀w': w' is compatible with what x believes in w: p(w') = 1]\n( [λw\" . it's raining in w\"] ) (Sue)\n= [λxe . ∀w': w' is compatible with what x believes in w: [λw\" . it's raining in\nw\"] (w') = 1] (Sue)\n= [λxe . ∀w': w' is compatible with what x believes in w: it's raining in w'] (Sue)\n= 1 iff ∀w': w' is compatible with what Sue believes in w: it's raining in w'\n2.5.\nAttitude predicates in set talk\nLexical entry for believe in set talk:\n(16)\n[ believe]]w = λp<s,t> . λxe . Belx,w ⊆ p\nShow what goes wrong if we use the wrong set relation (exercise 2.1 in von Fintel &\nHeim):\nWRONG LEXICAL ENTRY I:\n(17)\n[[believe] w = λp<s,t> . λxe . p = Belx,w\nCompute truth conditions of (15) at world w1 using meaning in (17):\n3⁄4 [ think]]w1 = [[believe]]w1 = λp<s,t> . λxe . p = Belx,w1\n3⁄4 [ Sue thinks that it's raining]]w1 = [λp<s,t> . λxe . p = Belx,w1] ( [λw\" . it's raining in\nw\"] ) (Sue)\n= [λxe . [λw\" . it's raining in w\"] = Belx,w1 ] (Sue)\nTranslate into set talk...\n= [λxe . {w\": it's raining in w\"} = Belx,w1 ] (Sue)\n= 1 iff {w\": it's raining in w\"} = BelSue,w1\n= 1 iff the set of worlds compatible with Sue's beliefs consists of all and only\nthose worlds where it's raining\nÆ Requires that any situation where it's raining is a possibility as far as Sue is\nconcerned (including ones where, for example, pink unicorns have taken over the\nearth). Æ Too strong!\n\nFeb. 24\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nWRONG LEXICAL ENTRY II:\n(18)\n[[believe] w = λp<s,t> . λxe . p ∩ Belx,w =∅\nCompute truth conditions of (15) at world w1 using meaning in (18):\n3⁄4 [ think]]w1 = [[believe]]w1 = λp<s,t> . λxe . p ∩ Belx,w1 =∅\n3⁄4 [ Sue thinks that it's raining]]w1 = [λp<s,t> . λxe . p ∩ Belx,w =∅] ( [λw\" . it's\nraining in w\"] ) (Sue)\n= [λxe . [λw\" . it's raining in w\"] ∩ Belx,w =∅] (Sue)\nTranslate into set talk...\n= [λxe . {w\": it's raining in w\"} ∩ Belx,w =∅] (Sue)\n= 1 iff {w\": it's raining in w\"} ∩ BelSue,w =∅\n= 1 iff there are some worlds compatible with Sue's beliefs such that it's raining\nÆ Only requires that Sue not have a definite belief that it's NOT raining - for\nexample, she could have no idea whether it's raining or not. Æ Too weak!\n3. Accessibility Relations\nQ. what does it mean to be \"compatible with\" a person's knowledge, beliefs, etc.?\nWe won't really answer this, but we can say a little bit more about knowledge, belief, etc.\n[and thus about the lexical semantics of know, believe, etc.]\nOne thing that helps: hold the subject and type of attitude constant, and consider mental\nstates as relations between worlds:\nAnother notation:\n(19)\nw Rx\nBel w'\n= w' is compatible with x's beliefs in w\nWhen the subject and attitude type are understood, we might write wRw'.\nSome terminology:\n3⁄4 R's of this type are called accessibility relations.\n3⁄4 wRw' can be read as w' is accessible to w / (sometimes) w sees w'\nWe can say something more about propositional attitudes by talking about the properties\nof these various accessibility relations\n\nFeb. 24\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\n3.1.1. Some properties of relations\nReflexivity\nR is reflexive iff for all x in the domain of R, xRx\nTransitivity\nR is transitive iff whenever xRy and yRz, it's also the case that xRz\nSymmetry\nR is symmetric iff whenever xRy, it's also the case that yRx\n3.1.2. Accessibility Relations for know\n3⁄4 Reflexive\n(This reflects the intuition that you can only know things that are true)\n3⁄4 Transitive?\nMaybe... This depends on whether we want to assume that if you know\nsomething, then you know that you know it\n3⁄4 Symmetric?\nProbably not ... This depends on whether we want to assume that if something\nhappens to be true in the actual world, then you know that it's compatible with\nyour knowledge\n3.1.3. Accessibility Relations for believe\n3⁄4 NOT reflexive\n(because you can believe things that are false)\n3⁄4 Transitive\nIf you believe something, then you believe that you believe it\n3⁄4 NOT Symmetric\nSomething can be the case in the actual world which you do not believe to be\ncompatible with your beliefs\n3.1.4. Accessibility Relations for want\n3⁄4 NOT reflexive\n(because you can want things to be the case that are not the case)\n3⁄4 NOT Transitive\n(because presumably you can want something without wanting to want it)\n3⁄4 NOT Symmetric\n\nFeb. 24\n24.910, Spring 2009 (Stephenson)\nSomething can be the case in the actual world which is not compatible with what\nyou want yourself to want\n[Obviously there's a lot more to say about these relations than these three properties, but\nthis gives us a framework]\n3.2.\nSelected Exercises\n[Possibly work through in class depending on time]\nExercise 2.3 (p. 20)\nThink about the accessibility relations involved in the following predicates:\n3⁄4 suspect\n3⁄4 imagine\n3⁄4 [More???]"
