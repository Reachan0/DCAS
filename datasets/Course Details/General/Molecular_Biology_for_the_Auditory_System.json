  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures / Labs: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nDuring the semester we will cover the exciting advances in the genetics and molecular biology of the inner ear. For the non-molecular biologists in the class, we will begin with a few lectures on basic molecular biology and genetics, covering both theory and techniques. We will also include an inner ear physiology review. We will study techniques for identifying \"deafness genes\" as well as genes and proteins recently identified as being critical for proper inner ear function. We will cover topics relating to inner ear development and hair cell regeneration. Additional lectures will explore recent advances in the field, studying such topics as syndromic and nonsyndromic hearing loss and the molecules that are responsible for hearing loss, such as connexins, myosins, transcription factors, extracellular matrix proteins and ion channels. We will also discuss techniques, such as the use of embryonic stem cells, used to further investigations into inner ear function. The lead faculty will deliver approximately half of the lectures, with the remaining lectures given by inner ear/deafness research experts from the Boston area.\n\nThe course this year will include a hands-on laboratory component, in which each student will perform basic molecular biology techniques for gene discovery. The students' research projects will be presented in class at the end of the semester. In addition, each student will present for discussion papers that cover in depth some of the topics discussed in class.\n\nLab\n\nThe course this year will include a hands-on laboratory component, in which each student will perform basic molecular biology techniques for gene discovery. Each student will have his/her own mini-research project. Results of students' research projects will be presented in class at the end of the semester.\n\nStudent Lead Discussion Sessions\n\nTwice during the semester, each student will present for discussion papers that cover in depth the topics discussed in class. These presentations are designed to familiarize students with techniques and strategies used by investigators to study the molecular biology of the auditory system.\n\nGrades\n\nGrades will be assigned based upon student participation in class, student presentations of lab work and journal articles, and a final exam.\n\nRecommended Text\n\nFor coverage of basic molecular biology, we recommend\nMolecular Biology of the Cell\nby Bruce Alberts et al., 2002, Garland Science.",

Give examples of four (total) tissue specific and/or developmentally regulated\ngenes that were presented in our discussion sessions and briefly explain (two or three\nsentences) why each falls into that category.\nQuestion 3 On average, what percentage of your DNA have you inherited from your\npaternal great-grandmother?\nQuestion 4 Here is the nucleotide sequence for the beginning of a theoretical gene:\nATGTTTCCTAAAGAGAGGATTCGTACTGGTGCGCATCCATGAAC....\nExon 1\nIntron 1\nExon 2\nThere are two exons and one intron shown (the intron is underlined).\nWhat is the amino acid sequence of the protein that corresponds to this nucleotide\nsequence?\nWhat is the new amino acid sequence if the two Ts at position 4 and 5 are deleted?\nQuestion 5 Here is a pedigree from a family in which sensorineural deafness is present in\nsome members. Squares are males, circles are females, dark symbols are deaf family\nmembers, white symbols are normal hearing family members.\nWhat is the mode of inheritance of deafness in this family?\nHarvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology\nHST.730: Molecular Biology for the Auditory System\n\nQuestion 6\nYour colleague has provided you with a breeder pair of mice that each carry a heterozygous\nknockout of the gene \"Dfns1\". In her construct, Dfns1 has been replaced by LacZ.\nHere are the two alleles:\nWild type Dfns1:\nDfns1 gene\n-----------------|-------------------*******************|****-------|---------------|------------\nBamHI\nEcoRI\nBamHI\nEcoRI\n|\n6kb\n| 1.5kb\n|\n2.5kb\n|\nA\nB\nMutated (knock-out) allele:\n-----------------|--------------------|--- lacZ-gene -----------|---------------|------------\nBamHI\nEcoRI\nBamHI\nEcoRI\n|\n2.5kb\n|\n3kb\n|\n2.5kb |\nA\nB\nYour colleague also gave you two short DNA fragments (A and B; shown in the drawings\nabove) that can be used as radioactive probes to detect wild type and mutated genomic DNA.\n6 weeks later, your breeder mice produced a litter of 8 animals and you prepared genomic\nDNA from each mouse.\n6A) What method do you use for genotyping (i.e. which animals are wild type and mutant)\nthe animals?\n6B)\nWhat genotypes do you expect?\nWhat is the expected frequency according to\nMendelian rules? (If all possible genotypes are viable)\n6C) Outline how you would be able to tell the difference between the possible\ngenotypes? Use a drawing of a possible result of a genotyping experiment with\nDNA from the 8 pups and the two parents.\n\nQuestion 7\n15 years ago, your Uncle Bill was a senior graduate student in the lab of a famous\nresearcher studying hair cell regeneration in sparrows. This was a new field at the time,\nand no one believed that hair cells could regrow after damage. Running a series of 2D\ngels*, Uncle Bill discovered a protein of about 44 kDa expressed in the basilar papilla\nthat increases in concentration beginning 1 day after noise damage. The increased protein\ngradually levels off, then declines after about two weeks.\nNo damage\n24 hours after damage\n72 hours after damage\nUncle Bill named this protein BPP for basilar papilla protein. Unfortunately, Uncle Bill's\nmentor was charged with scientific misconduct and tax evasion, and the lab was shut\ndown. Uncle Bill quit graduate school and went on to become rich after opening a chain\nof pet food stores. Before leaving the university, Uncle Bill painstakingly purified a\nsignificant quantity of the BPP protein and still has it in his -80 degree freezer at home.\nHe never did find out what it BPP was, but he has offered his vials of preserved BPP to\nyou, his favorite niece/nephew.\nList and explain a series of experiments that you, a modern molecular biologist, would\nperform on this interesting protein to try to figure out what it is and what it does. Explain\nwhy you chose to do these particular experiments and what you would learn from them.\nYou can assume that your experiments all work, and later experiments can build upon the\nresults of your early experiments. (They have to be real types of experiments that we've\ndiscussed during the course - please don't make up wild and fantastic new protocols.)\nYou don't have to go into excruciating experimental details, but provide us with enough\ninformation so that we know you know what you're talking about - the explanation for\n2D-gels below is an example of about the level of detail you need.\n*2D-gels are gels where you take protein extracts from a tissue or cells, and run out the\nextract on the gel twice - once vertically to separate based on size, and once horizontally\nto separate based on charge. You can do this, for example, with protein extracts made\nfrom the same tissue but at different time points, or before and after treatment, to see if\nthere are any differences. It also serves to adequately separate proteins from each other,\nso you can then purify the segregated proteins from the gel, if you wish.\n[We expect you to describe in detail (see above) 4 experiments of the series (that may\ncontain more experiments)]"

In\nfact, human hands are a rich source of RNase and it is therefore necessary to wear clean\ngloves during RNA isolation procedures and to use RNase-free labware.\n2.

Purification of mRNA\nSince RNA is single-stranded, any hydrolysis event that breaks the phosphate backbone will\nresult in cleavage of the molecule into subfragments. Two factors contribute to the biochemical\ninstability of RNA.\n1. Endoribonucleases (RNases) are very stable enzymes that cannot be easily inactivated . In\nfact, human hands are a rich source of RNase and it is therefore necessary to wear clean\ngloves during RNA isolation procedures and to use RNase-free labware.\n2. RNA is thermodynamically less stable than DNA because of the 2' hydroxyl group on the\nribose ring that promotes hydrophilic attack on the 5'-3' phosphodiester bond to form a 2'-3'\ncyclic phosphate. This cyclic phosphate intermediate is stabilized by Mg2+, a component of\nmany biochemical reactions.\n\n-->\n--> mRNA (PolyA+ RNA)\nChicken embryonic cochlea\nTotal RNA purification\nFirst strand cDNA synthesis --> Second strand cDNA synthesis\nAdapter ligation\n5'\n3'\n3'\n5'\nG\nNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACTCGA\nNNNNTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGAGCTC\nGAATTCG GCACGAG\nGCCGTGCTC\nEcoRI adaptor\nXhoI restriction\nsite\n\n500 chicken cochlear ducts (enriched sensory epithelium) - embryonic days 14-19\n100 Î¼g total RNA\n5 Î¼g polyA+ RNA (mRNA)\nFirst strand cDNA synthesis\nSecond strand cDNA synthesis\nAdapter ligation\npAD-Gal4 [EcoRI/XhoI]\ncDNA library in pAD-Gal4\n5 x 106 independent cDNA clones in pAD-Gal4\nÃamplification (transformation into E. coli and\nselection with ampicillin -> plasmid preparation\nSee Applied Molecular Genetics, R.
