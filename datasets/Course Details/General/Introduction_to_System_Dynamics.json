Students can take\n15.871\nalone, or combine it with\n15.872 System Dynamics II\n. Taken in sequence the courses constitute the introductory sequence in system dynamics. Successful completion of both\n15.871\nand\n15.872\nis a prerequisite for advanced courses in system dynamics, work as a research or teaching assistant in the field, or careers using system dynamics.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nPermission of instructor. No prior computer modeling experience is needed.\n\nCourse Objectives and Scope\n\nWhy do so many business strategies fail? Why do so many others fail to produce lasting results? Why do businesses suffer from periodic crises and fluctuations in sales, earnings, and morale? Why do some firms grow while others stagnate? And how can an organization's leadership and managers identify and design high-leverage policies, policies that are not thwarted by unanticipated side effects?\n\nAccelerating economic, technological, social, and environmental change challenges managers to learn at increasing rates. Today's economy requires us to design and manage complex systems where dynamic complexity is unavoidable, thanks to multiple feedback effects, long time delays, and nonlinear responses to our decisions. Yet learning in such environments is difficult precisely because we never confront many of the consequences of our most important decisions. Effective learning in such environments requires methods to develop systems thinking by representing and assessing dynamic complexity. It also requires tools that managers can use to accelerate learning throughout an organization.\n\n15.871\nand\n15.872\nintroduce you to system dynamics modeling for the analysis of business policy and strategy. You will learn to visualize a business organization in terms of the structures and policies that create dynamics and regulate performance. System dynamics allows us to create 'microworlds,' management flight simulators where space and time can be compressed, slowed, and stopped so we can experience the long-term side effects of decisions, systematically explore new strategies, and develop our understanding of complex systems. In these system dynamics courses we use simulation models, case studies, and management flight simulators to develop principles of policy design for successful management of complex strategies. Case studies of successful strategy design and implementation using system dynamics will be stressed. We consider the use of systems thinking to promote effective organizational learning.\n\nThe principal purpose of modeling is to improve our understanding of the ways in which an organization's performance is related to its internal structure and operating policies as well as those of customers, competitors, suppliers, and other stakeholders. During the course you will use several simulation models to explore such strategic issues as fluctuating sales, production and earnings; market growth and stagnation; the diffusion of new technologies; the use and reliability of forecasts; the rationality of business decision making; and applications in health care, energy policy, environmental sustainability, and other topics.\n\nStudents will learn to recognize and deal with situations where policy interventions are likely to be delayed, diluted, or defeated by unanticipated reactions and side effects. You will have a chance to use state of the art software for computer simulation and gaming. Assignments give hands-on experience in developing and testing computer simulation models in diverse settings.\n\nCourse Materials\n\nThe required text is:\n\nSterman, J.\nBusiness Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World\n. McGraw-Hill / Irwin, 2000. ISBN: 9780072389159.\n\nThere are additional required readings. Articles and case studies as assigned will be listed in the\nReadings\nsection. Additional readings will be handed out on an occasional basis.\n\nModeling Software\n\nIn this course, we use modeling software. Several excellent packages for system dynamics simulation are available, including\niThink\n, from High Performance Systems,\nPowersim\n, from Powersim Corporation, and\nVensim\n, from Ventana Systems. All are highly recommended. You may wish to learn more about these packages, as all are used in the business world and expertise in them is increasingly sought by potential employers. For further information, see the following resources:\n\niThink\n: See\nthe isee Systems web site\n.\n\nPowersim\n: See\nthe Powersim web site\n.\n\nVensim\n: See\nthe Ventana Systems web site\n.\n\nThe required modeling software is VensimPLE\n. In this course, we will be using the Vensim Personal Learning Edition (\nVensimPLE\n) by Ventana Systems. The current version is 6.1. It is free for academic use and is available for Windows and Mac. VensimPLE comes with sample models, help engine, and Adobe Acrobat format User's Guide, all available from\nthe Vensim web site\n.\n\nNOTE:\nThe disc that comes with the\nBusiness Dynamics\ntextbook includes a version of VensimPLE. However, the version available online is much newer and has enhanced functionality. Be sure to download the current version of VensimPLE from the website above. Vensim models on the textbook CD will work with it.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nAssignments\n\nClass participation\n\nPeer evaluation\n\nAssignments are due by 5 pm on the due date--you should never skip class to complete an assignment. Each assignment is graded on a 10-point scale. A minimum of two points will be forfeited for assignments turned in late. Assignments handed in more than one class late receive no credit.\nThis policy is strictly enforced\n.\n\nPeer Evaluation\n\nSome assignments will be done in teams of three. At the end of the course you will have the opportunity to evaluate your teammates. The Peer Evaluation is confidential. You will assess how well your teammates contributed to your team's assignments and your individual learning. Specifically, each member of a team will assign a total of 20 points to the other two members of the team, with more points indicating higher contribution of that person to the team. Raters must differentiate some in their ratings (this means each rater must give at least one score of 11 or higher, with a maximum of 15, and at least one score of 9 or lower). As a result team peer evaluation will produce differences in grades only within teams. The best strategy is to do your best on each assignment, to help your teammates understand the concepts and to create a constructive, supportive environment that enhances everyone's learning.\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nAssignmentS out\n\nAssignmentS due\n\nIntroduction: Purpose and concepts of system dynamics\n\nAssignment 0 out\n\nSystem Dynamics Tools Part 1: Building a model\n\nAssignment 1 out\n\nAssignment 0 due\n\nSystem Dynamics Tools Part 2: Problem definition and model purpose; building theory with causal loop diagrams\n\nSystem Dynamics Tools Part 3: Mapping the stock and flow structure of systems\n\nAssignment 2 out\n\nAssignment 1 due\n\nSystem Dynamics Tools Part 4: Dynamics of stocks and flows; linking feedback with stock and flow structure\n\nSystem Dynamics Tools Part 5: Understanding the Dynamics of Simple Systems\n\nAssignment 3 out\n\nAssignment 2 due\n\nSystem Dynamics Tools Part 6: Analyzing Systems and Creating Robust Policies\n\nIndustry dynamics and diffusion models\n\nAssignment 4 out\n\nAssignment 3 due\n\nGrowth Strategies: Network externalities, complementarities, and path dependence\n\nGuest Lecture: Mark Paich System Dynamics at General Motors and beyond\n\nInteractions of Operations, Strategy, and Human Resource Policy: The case of People Express\n\nAssignment 5 out\n\nAssignment 4 due\n\nLessons from People Express.\n\nCourse wrap up and evaluations.\n\nAssignment 5 due",

Infectious diseases\npresent critical management and public policy challenges (consider SARS, MERS, Avian influenza, HIV,\nor the threat of bioterror attack). They also provide a useful setting to explore feedback--how the states\nof a system (the levels or stocks) influence (or \"feed back\" to) the flows that alter those states. The\nassignment also introduces you to the structure and behavior of fundamental feedback systems. These\nsystems are the building blocks from which more complex systems are composed. In particular, the\nfeedback structure governing the spread of contagious disease can also help to explain the growth of new\nproducts, the diffusion of innovations, the spread of financial panics, and other forms of social contagion\nimportant in business settings. The assignment gives you practice with the concepts of dynamic modeling\nand the modeling process while enabling familiarity with the modeling software we will use.\nYou are to work on this assignment individually, and submit your individual work and writeup via the\ncourse website.\n\nA.\nGet the Software\nWe've mentioned that there are several excellent software packages available for dynamic modeling. For\nour work this semester we will use the VensimPLE software. Your syllabus and Assignment 0 explained\nhow to download and install the program.\nB.\nBecome Familiar with the Software and Build and Explore the Base Model\nMake sure to start your work early this week and attend the recitation if you have questions.\nDownload both <VensimPLE_Tutorial_F2013.pdf> and the datafile <SARSDATA.vdf>, which contains\ndata for the Taiwanese SARS epidemic as a Vensim Data File (.vdf). Put the SARSDATA file in your\nVensim directory. The tutorial walks you though the development of the epidemic model step by step and\nshows you how to use the data.\n\nB1.\n2 points. Do the tutorial and build the model it describes.\nBe sure to document your model (both the diagram and the equations). This means the\nfollowing:\n1. Add sufficient commentary and explanation so that the meaning of each variable, the\nreasoning behind each formulation, and the data sources for each parameter value are\nclear to your audience. Do not wait until later to fill in the documentation, but document\neach equation as you create it. Doing so saves time in the long run. Forcing yourself to\ndescribe, in writing, the rationale for each formulation and sources for each parameter\ntests your understanding: if you can't write a concise, clear description of a formulation\nyou probably don't understand it well enough.\n2. Label causal links with the correct polarities.\n3. Denote causal loops with appropriate names and labels.\nAlways provide the units of measure for every variable, and check that every equation is\ndimensionally consistent. Vensim can test your model for dimensional consistency (see the\ntutorial). Models that fail the dimensional consistency test are meaningless. Dimensional\nerrors are usually symptoms of more serious conceptual difficulties.\nAs you finish the tutorial, you will have chosen base case parameter values for the exogenous\nparameters we asked you to select. Once you have a satisfactory overall pattern of behavior,\ndon't worry too much about the exact values, but use the base case settings as a basis for\ncomparison in the questions that follow.\n\nInclude your model (the \".mdl\" model file you created in Vensim) with your final submission.\n\nB2.\n2 points. Answer the following three questions.\na.\nWhat happens when you initialize the stock of infected people at zero? Briefly explain how you\naccount for the behavior you observed with reference to the model's structure (remember,\nstructure drives behavior). How do the dynamics change if you assume that one or more members\nof the population in question are already infected?\nb.\nHow do the dynamics change as the contact frequency increases? Does changing the contact\nfrequency influence the total number of people who get SARS? Explain why or why not with\nreference to the structure of the model.\nc.\nHow do the dynamics change as infectivity varies? Explain.\nSubmit your answers to the above questions in a brief writeup: each answer may be a few\nsentences and involve a handful of model runs. To back up your points, show only a few\ngraphs, tables, or any form of result summary based on model output. You need not show all\nmodel runs you have done--just select the minimum you need to answer the questions\nconcisely.\nNote: Place relevant selections of models and graphs next to your answers to a given\nquestion. Placing graphs in an appendix makes it harder to follow your logic (and to grade\nyour work appropriately)\nB3.\n2 points. Critique your model.\n\nThe model you have developed so far is very simple. Briefly critique its formulation and list the\nmajor assumptions you view as unrealistic. Aim for one paragraph or so.\n\nC.\nImprove Your Model.\n\nIn developing your critique of the model, you should have identified a range of unrealistic\nassumptions. In this section we will guide your exploration of what happens when one such\nassumption is relaxed.\nC1.\n2 points. So far we've assumed people remain infectious indefinitely. In epidemiology this is\nknown as the \"SI\" (for Susceptible-Infectious) model. The SI model is appropriate for chronic\ninfections that the body cannot clear and for which there is no cure, so that people remain\ninfectious indefinitely. For most infectious diseases, including SARS, smallpox, chicken pox,\nmeasles, and influenza, patients either recover or die.\n\nWe'll help you reformulate your model to capture the notion that people eventually recover from\nSARS and are thus no longer infectious. The revised model is known in epidemiology as the\n\"SIR\" model (the \"R\" denotes \"Removal\" or \"Recovery\"). After following our instructions, your\nfinal model will look something like the following:\n\nTo modify your model, first create a new stock to represent the recovered population, placing it\nto the right of Population Infected with SARS. Next create a new flow, called the Recovery\nRate, that moves people from the Infectious to the Recovered states (see the tutorial for help in\ncreating stock and flow variables). Set the initial number of Population Recovered from SARS\nto zero.\nFor simplicity, we will not distinguish death from recovery, so the recovery flow includes\nthose recovering and those dying.\n\nNext add an auxiliary variable representing the average duration of infection (that is, how long\npeople remain infectious, on average).\n\nNow you need to capture the feedback structure determining the rate at which people recover.\nThe number of people who recover per day must depend on the number of people who are\ncurrently infected and the average duration of their infectivity. There are several ways to model\nthe recovery process, but the simplest (and most widely used) is:\n\nRecovery Rate = Population Infected with SARS/Average Duration of Infectivity\nTo implement this formulation you need to add causal links connecting the infected stock and the\naverage duration of infectivity to the recovery flow, as shown on the previous model diagram.\nNext, change the equation for the infected population so that the recovery flow is now included\nas an outflow that drains the infected stock. Alter the equation for the Population Infected with\nSARS to read:\n\nPopulation Infected with SARS = INTEG(Infection Rate - Recovery Rate)\nThe equation states that the infectious population increases as people become infectious and\ndecreases as people recover; the population infected with SARS accumulates the difference\nbetween infection and recovery.\nNote that the infectious population is no longer equal to the cumulative number of cases.\nFinally, you must estimate a value for Average Duration of Infectivity. Epidemiologists believe\nthe infectious stage of SARS lasts about 1 to 3 weeks (7 - 21 days). Use your judgment to select\na base case value.\nCheck that your diagram now resembles that on the previous page.\nMake sure your revised model is documented and dimensionally consistent.\n\nWhat kind of feedback loop have you added to your model? Make sure you have added an\nappropriate loop identifier and loop name to your diagram.\n\nInclude your model (the \".mdl\" model file you created in Vensim) with your final submission.\nC2.\n2 points. Analyze your model to determine the effect of adding recovery.\n\nExplore how your model now behaves by running simulation tests. How do the dynamics change\nas the duration of infectivity is increased or decreased? What is different now? Explain in a brief\ndiscussion with reference to the structure of your model. You need not include many runs or\ntables, but do present a small selection of graphs or an overview of the data to back up your\npoints.\nBonus Return to the questions you explored before. How does the epidemic change, once recovery is\nadded? Now, what is the effect when contact frequency and infectivity change? Vary key\nparameters over a range to be sure you understand the possible dynamics of the system.\nSpecifically, consider how the timing and severity of the epidemic change with parameters. How\ndo the dynamics differ from those of the SI model in which there is no recovery?\n\nD.\nWhat to hand in and how to submit your work\nWrite up your responses to the questions above in a word (.docx) document. In addition, you\nneed to submit the various Vensim model (.mdl) files called for above in parts B1 and C1.\nUpload your assignment by 5 PM on Sept 16, 2013. Submit your assignment as a single .zip file\nincluding your response document and models.\nName files with your last name, and for multiple files of the same type, the assignment section,\ne.g. \"Smith.docx\", \"Smith-B1.mdl\", and \"Smith-C1.mdl\", all submitted as part of \"Smith.zip\".\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\n15.871 Introduction to System Dynamics\nFall 2013\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nSloan School of Management\n\nUnderstanding Epidemics Using\n\nVensimPLE\n\nFor use with VensimPLE, version 6.1\n\nOriginally developed by Nelson Repenning, MIT Sloan School of Management System Dynamics\nGroup. Revised by John Sterman (MIT), Hazhir Rahmandad (Virginia Tech and MIT). Last\nrevision: August 2013 Nelson Repenning (MIT)\n\nI. Getting Started\n\nThis tutorial familiarizes you with building and analyzing system dynamics models using the\nVensimPLE software. To do so you are going to build a simple model that captures the dynamics\nof an infectious disease like SARS.\n\nBackground: SARS, a corona-virus, emerged in Asia in 2003. To focus our modeling effort, we\nwill build a model to capture the course of the epidemic in Taiwan. The graphs below show the\nincidence (rate at which new cases were reported, measured in people/day) and cumulative\nprevalence (cumulative number of cases reported, measured in people) for SARS in Taiwan.\n\nTo begin you need to get VensimPLE ready for modeling. The latest version of VensimPLE is\navailable for free download from http://www.vensim.com. When you first open VensimPLE, the\nscreen should look like this:\n\nTo start working on a new model go to the File menu and select New Model.... You'll see a\ndialog box asking for Model Settings. You'll be choosing the time horizon of your model (when\nyour simulation will start and finish), the appropriate time step (how accurately you wish to\nsimulate your model), and your units of time.\n\nStart your model of the Taiwanese SARS epidemic at day 0 (enter 0 in the INITIAL TIME box)\nand simulate for 120 days (enter 120 the FINAL TIME box). Select a time step of 0.25 days by\nentering 0.25 into the third box. Check the box saying Save results every TIME STEP. Also\nselect the Units for Time to be Day. For now, leave Integration Type at the default setting,\nEuler. Click OK.\n\nNow save your model by selecting the File>Save As menu and entering the desired name in the\nFile Name field and clicking on Save. Enter the name SARS_model_step_1 (VensimPLE will\nautomatically supply the .mdl extension).\n\nBefore beginning to develop your model, make sure the SARS data are loaded. Download\n<SARSDATA.vdf> if you haven't already, and place the file in your Vensim directory .Then\nload the dataset by clicking on\nto get the control panel (which should look like this):\n\nVensim saves every simulation run and custom graph you produce as a separate file. It supplies a .vdf extension\nfor simulation runs and a .vgd extension for custom graphs. These files cannot be opened from outside the\nVensim application; they can be opened from inside Vensim through the Control Panel.\n\nIf you see something different, click on the Datasets tab. To load the data file, SARSDATA,\nselect it by clicking and then hit the >> button which will move it to the Loaded column\n(navigate via the Load From... button if you put the data somewhere else on your computer).\nThe data set is now available.\nNote: To access the data, you must use variable names exactly as specified in this\ntutorial.\nNow you are ready to start building your model.\n\nII. Developing the Stock, Flow, and Feedback Structure\n\nThe VensimPLE software is designed using the metaphor of a \"workbench.\" The large blank\narea in the middle of the screen is your work area, where you develop and analyze your model.\nThe buttons on the border of the work area represent the different tools available as you work on\nyour model. The tools on the top horizontal row are for building your model. The tools on the\nleft vertical bar are for model analysis. The tools on the bottom horizontal row allow you to\nchange the formatting of the model diagram. You will become familiar with many of these tools\nas you build the epidemic model.\n\nTo begin, add a stock representing the population susceptible to SARS to your model. Click on\nthe\nbutton to activate the stock tool, denoted by a box in the menu on the top horizontal\ntoolbar. Then click in the left center of the screen. Use this tool whenever you want to add a\nstock (or level variable) to your model.\n\nVensimPLE then returns an empty text box and a blinking cursor. Type the variable name\nPopulation Susceptible to SARS and then hit the return key. If the variable name does not fit\ncomfortably within the stock, you can re-size the stock by \"grabbing\" the handle in the lower\nright corner (place the mouse at the corner to allow you to change modes, then hold down the left\nmouse button) and moving the mouse. Your screen should now look like this:\n\nYou have just created the first variable in your model, the stock of people that could potentially\ncontract SARS.\n\nNow add the stock of people that have contracted the disease. Click on the stock tool button, and\nthen click again about two inches to the right of the susceptible stock. Name this variable\nPopulation Infected with SARS. Resize if needed. Your screen should now look like this:\n\nNow add the flow of infections that connects the two stocks. Click on the\nrate button in the\ntop horizontal tool menu. Now, click and release inside the stock of susceptible people, then\nmove the cursor so that it sits inside the infected stock, then click and release again. VensimPLE\nthen gives you an empty text box and a blinking cursor. Type Infection Rate and hit the return\nkey. Your screen should now look like this:\n\nYou have now created the flow, Infection Rate, which decreases the stock of people susceptible\nto SARS and increases the stock of those infected. Now you need to add the variables that close\nthe loops between that infection rate and the states of the susceptible and infected stocks. Begin\nby adding the two auxiliary variables that determine the infection rate, Infectivity and Contacts\nBetween Infected and Uninfected People.\nTo add Infectivity click on the\nbutton and then click again approximately one inch above\nthe infection rate flow. When the text box appears, type Infectivity and hit return. To add the\nnext variable, click again, this time about an inch below the infection flow. When the text box\nappears, type Contacts Between Infected and Uninfected People. Unlike the previous\nvariables--which were either stocks or flows--the new variables are not attached to a flow valve\nor a box. These are called auxiliary variables.\nTo represent that the Infection Rate is determined by Infectivity and Contacts Between\nInfected and Uninfected People, we connect them with causal arrows.\nFirst click on the\nbutton to select the causal arrow tool. Now, click and release on the\nvariable Infectivity and then click and release again on Infection Rate. Do the same for\nContacts Between Infected and Uninfected People and Infection Rate. Make sure your causal\narrows actually end on the word Infection Rate. They should not be attached to the stocks. You\ncan delete arrows or other model objects and variables using the\ndelete tool.\nClicking on the\nmove/size button allows you to select the variables you have created and\nmove them to different places on the screen. To do this, place the arrow cursor over the variable\nyou wish to move, hold down the mouse button, move the variable to the desired place, and then\nrelease the mouse button. You can also select the \"handles\" of the causal arrows (the small\ncircles in the middle of the arrow) and change the curvature of the arrow. Arrange your variables\nand arrows so that your diagram looks approximately like this:\n\nNow, update your diagram to show the polarity of the causal connections. First click on the\n\nbutton. Then select the \"handle\" of the arrow you wish to label by clicking and releasing on the\nsmall circle in the middle of the arrow (the entire arrow is highlighted when selected).\n\nWith the arrow still selected, right click (Mac users\ncontrol click) to call up a dialog box for your arrow,\nshown here. Select the correct polarity indications for\neach of the two causal arrows so your diagram\nresembles the image below.\n\nUse this same dialog box to move the polarity labels\nto the other side of the arrow or change arrow width.\n\nYou may want to move the handle of each arrow\naround a little to adjust where its label appears, so\nthat you can make sure that each sign is clearly\nassociated with its causal arrow.\n\nNote that you can select multiple links or variables at the same time by holding down the shift\nkey while selecting objects. This is useful for efficiently assigning multiple polarities (the labels\ndenoting + and - ).\n\nNow, using the same steps discussed above, add the necessary variables, links, and labels so that\nyour diagram looks like this:\n\nFinally, label the loops you have just created. Use the comment tool to add comments and\ngraphics that, while having no structural use, can greatly help someone else understand your\nmodel diagram.\n\nTo do this, click on the\nbutton and then click in the center of the feedback loop. After\nclicking in the center of the reinforcing loop (the one linking the infection rate and the infected\npopulation), you should see the following dialog box:\n\nTo label the reinforcing loop click, on the Loop Clkwse button in the Shape box; click on\nCenter in the Text Position box; and type R in the Comment box. Click on the OK button or\nhit return. The loop identifier\nwill be displayed.\nNow select the comment tool again and click below the loop identifier label you just created.\nType the name of the loop into the Comment field. A good name for this loop is the\n\"Contagion\" loop. Click on the OK button or hit return. Now you will see the loop type and\nname together. Repeat this process to label the balancing feedback on the left side of your model\ndiagram, noting that this feedback moves counterclockwise. Name that loop the \"Depletion\"\nloop. Your model should now look like:\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that the arrow around each loop identifier flows in the same direction as\nthe loop to which it refers. The reinforcing Contagion loop is clockwise in your diagram, so its\nloop identifier is also clockwise; the Depletion loop on the left moves counterclockwise, so its\n\nidentifier moves clockwise. Labeling and naming your loops is important to help your audience\nsee the feedback structure of your model.\n\nIII. Specifying Equations for Your Model\nNow that you have developed a complete stock, flow, and feedback representation for your initial\nmodel of the SARS epidemic, you need to write equations for each of the variables.\nTo begin, click on the\nequations button on the top horizontal toolbar. The variables in your\ndiagram become highlighted.\n\nHighlighting indicates that the equation for that variable is incomplete.\n\nVariables in system dynamics models are classified as either exogenous or endogenous.\nExogenous variables are those that are defined independent of other variables of the model. They\nare functions of time (i.e., Exogenous Variable = f(t)). Of course the exogenous variables may be\nconstants, in which case they are called parameters. Endogenous variables are influenced by\nother variables in the system (Endogenous Variable = f(x, y, z), where x, y, z are other variables\nin the model).\n\nYour model has three exogenous inputs--Infectivity, Contact Frequency, and the Total\nPopulation--and six endogenous variables--Population Susceptible to SARS, Infection Rate,\nPopulation Infected with SARS, Probability of Contact with Infected Person, Susceptible\nContacts, and Contacts Between Infected and Uninfected People.\n\nStart by writing the equations for the endogenous variables. Begin by clicking on the Infection\nRate. You then see the following dialog box:\n\nGood modeling practice requires that each equation in a model have three elements: (1) the\nequation itself; (2) specified units of measure; and (3) complete documentation.\n\nYou'll be entering the equation in the box adjacent to the word Equations and the units of\nmeasure in the text field to the right of the word Units. Equation documentation is entered in the\nbox to the right of the word Comment.\n\nBegin writing the equation first by clicking in the equations box. Now, look in the box below it\non the right, where Causes are listed. Here Vensim has provided you with the two variables that\nyour model diagram shows as influencing the infection rate, Contacts Between Infected and\nUninfected People and Infectivity. A simple and plausible formulation for the infection rate is\nsimply to multiply the number of contacts by the infectivity (which, by definition, is the fraction\nof contacts that result in transmission of the disease, or equivalently, the conditional probability\nof transmission given a contact between an infected and susceptible individual). To enter this\nequation first click on the Contacts Between Infected and Uninfected People variable, which\n\nwill now appear in the equation box. Now either click on or type \"*\" to represent multiplication.\nComplete the equation by clicking on Infectivity. Your dialog box should now look like this:\n\nNow fill in the units. Infection Rate represents flow of people through time, so the appropriate\nunit of measure for this equation is people/time unit. Since you already chose to run the model in\ntime steps of 1 day, the appropriate unit is people/day. Type People/Day in the Units field.\n\n(The next time you specify the units for a variable in this model, People/Day will appear in the\nunits pull-down menu. You can then click on the arrowhead to the right of the units field to see\nunits already specified for other variables in the model, and then select units you've already\ndefined from that list as appropriate.)\n\nFinally, provide a description of this equation in the comment field. A good comment will be\nbrief but also explain the logic behind the equation and state the key assumptions. For example,\none might write for this equation:\n\nThe infection rate is determined by the total number of contacts between infected\nand uninfected people each day and the probability that each such contact results in\ntransmission from the infected to uninfected person (denoted infectivity).\n\nYour dialog box should now look like this:\n\nClick on OK or hit return and your diagram will look like this:\n\nThe Infection Rate is no longer highlighted, indicating that you have specified its equation.\n\nNow write the equation for the stock of susceptible people. Begin by clicking on the Population\nSusceptible to SARS stock. You should get a dialog box that looks like the following:\n\nYou enter the equation for the stock in the equation box. The value of a stock at any moment in\ntime is equal to the sum of all that stock's inflows less all of its outflows from the start time of\nthe simulation, plus the initial value. In the Windows version of VensimPLE, the term Integ\nappears to the left of the equation box, indicating that its value is an integral; the current Mac\nversion omits this term.*\n\nWhen you created the stock, flow, and feedback diagram, you made the Infection Rate an\noutflow from the stock of People Susceptible to SARS. VensimPLE captures this stock-flow\nrelationship by identifying the Type for the susceptible stock as Level (level is another term for\nstock). This means that at any point in time the susceptible stock is equal to its initial condition\nless all the people that have flowed out of it, up to that point in time.\n\nNow we need to specify the initial value for the susceptible stock. You enter it in the box just to\nthe right of the words Initial Value. Initial conditions can either be numbers or other variables in\n\n* Stock = INTEG(Inflow - Outflow) with an Initial Value of Stock(t0) is equivalent to:\n\nStock(T) =\nInflow(t)-Outflow(t)\n(\n)dt + Stock(t0\nt0\nT\no\n)\nNote: Do not write \"INTEG\" in the equation box, Vensim automatically returns the integral of the equation (when\nvariable type is level).\n\na model. It is usually better to initialize a stock in terms of a parameter (or combinations of\nparameters), because you can then alter that parameter easily for sensitivity and policy testing. In\nthis case initialize the stock based on another variable, specifically the Total Population. Enter\nTotal Population in the Initial Value box.\n\nYour equation for the Population Susceptible to SARS indicates that the susceptible population\nis equal to the initial value at the start of the simulation less all of those people who have\nsubsequently contracted the disease.\n\nYou still need to specify the unit of measure and document your equation in the comment field.\nThe Population Susceptible to SARS is a stock and is measured number of people, so go ahead\nand add People to the Units box, then document the equation. A sample comment for\nPopulation Susceptible to SARS is:\n\nThe Population Susceptible to SARS is the equal to the population susceptible prior\nto the onset of the disease less all of those that have contracted it. It is initialized to\nthe Total Population, which assumes that all individuals are initially susceptible (no\nprior natural or vaccine-conferred immunity).\n\nAfter completing the dialog box, click OK or press return. Your model diagram should now look\nlike this:\n\nFollowing a similar process to the one outlined above, you should now be able to specify\nequations for the remaining endogenous variables, Susceptible Contacts, Contacts Between\nInfected and Uninfected People, and Probability of Contact with Infected Person:\n\nSusceptible Contacts= Population Susceptible to SARS*Contact Frequency\n(People/Day)\n\nContacts Between Infected and Uninfected People=\nSusceptible Contacts*Probability of Contact with Infected Person\n(People/Day)\n\nProbability of Contact with Infected Person= Population Infected with SARS/Total Population\n\n(Dimensionless)\n\nFinally, you need to specify equations for the exogenous variables, Infectivity, Contact\nFrequency, and Total Population. Begin with Total Population. Clicking on it should bring\nup the following dialog box:\n\nNote first that there are no inputs to Total Population, just as you specified in the diagram,\nindicating that Total Population will be a constant. The data suggest that in Taiwan, the\ncumulative number of cases eventually rose to approximately 350, so start with that value for\nTotal Population (you may want to revisit this assumption later). You also need to specify units\nof measure and provide a comment. When you are finished your dialog box will look like this:\n\nFollowing this example, complete the equations for the other two parameters, Contact\nFrequency (People/Day) and Infectivity (dimensionless). Contact Frequency represents the\nnumber of contacts between infected and uninfected people every day. Infectivity represents the\nprobability that each episode of contact results in transmission of the infection.\n\nAt this point, you do not have specific data for the values of these parameters. Use your own\njudgment to determine appropriate values--make a reasonable guess. Later we will discuss how\nyou can test the model's sensitivity to these assumptions.\n\nFinally, set an appropriate initial value, units, and comment for the Population Infected with\nSARS, using your judgment to select what you consider a reasonable initial numerical value.\n\nNow we will add something extra to allow us to compare the behavior of the model to the data\nfor the SARS epidemic in Taiwan. You've loaded a file containing these data (SARSDATA.vdf).\nTo compare the model against the data we need to create variables that correspond to the\nincidence of new cases, which in the original dataset is denoted New Reported Cases, and the\nprevalence of SARS, denoted Cumulative Reported Cases. Because the data file uses these\nvariable names you must create variables in your model with exactly the same names.\nUse the stock variable tool\nto create a new stock called Cumulative Reported Cases,\nplacing it a few inches below the current structure. Then use the flow tool\nto create an\ninflow to that stock. Do this by first clicking and releasing in the blank space to the left of your\nnew stock, then moving your cursor to inside the stock and clicking and releasing again. Call this\n\nflow New Reported Cases. The new structure captures the relationship between incidence and\nprevalence: As new cases are reported, the cumulative number of cases increases. Your diagram\nshould look similar to the following:\n\nTo define New Reported Cases as equal to the infection rate you could simply draw a causal\narrow from the Infection Rate to New Reported Cases. However, doing so would clutter the\ndiagram. Instead, we will use a Shadow Variable. Select the Shadow Variable tool\nfrom the\ntop toolbar. Click about an inch to the left of New\nReported Cases. The dialog box shown on the left will\npop up, listing all variables in the model. Select the\nInfection Rate, then click OK.\n\nVensim creates a copy (Shadow) of the Infection Rate.\nShadow variables are gray and placed within braces:\n<Infection Rate>. Your diagram should now look like\nthis:\n\nShadow variables enable you to keep your model diagrams clean and readable. Draw a causal\narrow from the shadow <Infection Rate> to New Reported Cases:\n\nUse the equation tool to define New Reported Cases as equal to the Infection Rate. The units\nfor New Reported Cases are People/Day. Add an appropriate comment (point out that you are\nassuming that new cases are reported immediately). Now define the stock of Cumulative\nReported Cases. You will see that Cumulative Reported Cases is already defined as the\nintegral (accumulation) of New Reported Cases. You need to supply the initial number of\nreported cases, which is zero. Specify the units as People and add an appropriate comment.\n\nBy setting New Reported Cases to equal the Infection Rate we've made a choice to ignore\npotential differences between the two. In reality there is a delay between infection, diagnosis, and\nreporting through the public health system. In addition, diagnosis is imperfect (some actual\nSARS cases were missed; other respiratory diseases might be incorrectly classified as SARS).\nModeling both diagnostic errors and reporting delays is straightforward, but we will not do so in\nthis tutorial.\n\nSimilarly, you may have noticed that in this model Cumulative Reported Cases will equal the\nactual Population Infected with SARS, because you have assumed that New Reported Cases\nequals the actual Infection Rate. Why then bother to define Cumulative Reported Cases\nseparately from the Population Infected with SARS? There are two reasons. First, they are\nconceptually different: the actual number of people infected with SARS differs from the number\nreported through the public health surveillance system (there may be delays and measurement\nerrors you might want to capture later). Second, you might later alter the model structure so that\nthe equivalence of the two stocks no longer holds (for example, capturing the rates of recovery\nand mortality from SARS).\n\nIV. Using the Model Structure Analysis Tools\n\nYou are now ready to analyze your model. VensimPLE provides several tools for analyzing and\nunderstanding the structure of your model.\n\nBy far the most important of these is the unit-checking function. To access this tool, go to the\nModel menu and select Units Check. An important feature of any system dynamics equation is\ndimensional consistency. This is just a fancy way of saying that the units of measure must be the\nsame on both the left and right sides of the equation. For example, if you have followed the\ninstructions in the tutorial so far and you run the units check, you will get the following message:\n\nFollowed by:\n\nThe problem is that the equation for Susceptible Contacts is not dimensionally consistent: The\nright and left sides of the equation have different units. Susceptible Contacts is measured in\ncontacts per day, but, in the current formulation, multiplying the Population Susceptible to\nSARS by the Contact Frequency yields a value with units of People*People/Day.\nThe cause of the problem is that unit of measure for Contact Frequency is incorrect. The\nContact Frequency represents the number of contacts each person makes per day, not the total\nnumber of contacts (which is captured by the variable Susceptible Contacts). To fix this\nproblem, change the units of measure for contact frequency to be People/Person/Day+. After you\ndo this, run the units check again. When you are done click OK. Now when you run the units\ncheck you should get the following:\n\nThe units in your model now balance.\n\n+ In units for contact frequency Vensim will cancel out people with person, recognizing from unit equivalency\nsettings that the two point to the same concept. Current unit equivalencies are specified under\nModel>Settings>Units Equiv and can be edited to include other items.\n\nThe other tools are useful. The\ncauses tree and the\nuses tree buttons create a\nrepresentation of \"causes\" and \"uses\" trees for the selected variable. To use these tools, you need\nto first select a variable. Do this by first clicking on the\nbutton and then clicking on the\nvariable you wish to select. Clicking on a variable selects that variable to the workbench. You\ncan tell which variable is selected by looking at the top border of the VensimPLE window. If\nyou select the variable Infection Rate, the top border will look like this.\n\nHaving selected Infection Rate, clicking on the two \"causes\" and \"uses\" buttons in sequence\ngives you:\n\nand\n\nThe\ntool identifies all the feedback loops in which the selected variable is a member, and the\nbutton creates a documented listing of the equations in your model.\n\nV. Simulating Your Model\nVensimPLE also has tools to help you analyze the behavior of your model. Before doing this,\nhowever, you must actually simulate the model so you have some behavior to analyze.\nTo run a simulation, you first need to choose a name for this particular model run. It is helpful to\nchoose names that suggest some idea of what is being tested rather than using names like SIM1,\nSIM2, etc. Since this is the base case run for your model, you might choose to call the run\n\nBASE.* The name of the simulation is entered in the white box in the analysis tool bar. The\ndefault name for any simulation run is Current. Change this to Base.\nTo run a simulation, click the\nbutton and your model will start simulating.\nOnce the simulation run is completed, you can look at the results of your simulation.\nVensimPLE provides many tools with which to view simulation output. The most basic of these\nis the graph. To create a graph of the Cumulative Reported Cases, first click on the\ntool\nand then click on the desired variable.\nTo see a strip graph, click on the\nbutton in the left toolbar. You will then see the output of\nyour model, compared against the data. The behavior of your model will depend on the\nparameters you have chosen. For example, one set of parameter values and initial conditions\ngenerated the following graph:\n\n* Advanced Tip: VensimPLE also offers you the choice of two numerical integration methods, Euler and Runge-Kutta 4.\nRunge-Kutta 4 is a more accurate simulation method, but it is also more computationally intensive. Generally, it is better to\nuse the Euler method and change only if you believe you are seeing integration error. Read Business Dynamics, Appendix A,\nfor further details.\n\nBesides the graph, VensimPLE provides many other ways\nto examine simulation output. The\nbutton displays a\nstrip graph of the currently selected variable, along with\ngraphs of all the variables that determine the selected\nvariable (the causes). Clicking this button gives you:\n\nVensimPLE also can present the output in the form of a table rather than a graph. To see a table\nsimply click on the\nbutton.\n\nHaving examined the output of this simulation, you may wish to run additional simulations under\ndifferent assumptions. For example, what would happen if you cut the contact frequency in half?\n\nOne way to do this is simply to change the model equation in the variable's equation box. This is\ntime-consuming and error-prone, however, since you must remember to go back and change the\nparameter back to its original value before testing another assumption. If you change a variable's\nformulation in its equation box, it remains as you specify until you change it again. So, if you\nwant to alter a variable's value only once, to observe its effect on the simulation, and then have\nthe variable revert to its original value, you can use the Parameter Changes button, accessible on\nthe analysis tool bar.\nTest the effect of a change in the Contact Frequency by clicking the\nbutton. Your screen\nshould now look like this:\n\nTo change the contact frequency for this simulation, click on Contact Frequency and its current\nvalue will appear in a box. Type in a smaller value (such as a 50% reduction) and hit return.\nBefore simulating, make sure you change the name of the simulation so that you can compare the\ntwo different runs. Select a name that helps describe the changes you made, for example, \"Low\nContact Frequency.\"\nTo run the simulation with your new value for the contact frequency, just click on the\n\nbutton. Note that you have changed the contact frequency for that run only, and have not\nchanged it in the underlying model equations.\n\nNow when you select any of the model output tools, they show the results from both simulations\n(along with the data). For example, the graph tool displays:\n\nIf you do not wish to see the previous (base) run displayed with the new simulation run, then\nclick on the\nbutton. This is the Control Panel. Click on the Datasets tab and the dialog\nbox will display the three data sets you have created so far:\n\nTo de-select a run, simply double-click on it. The run you de-select will now appear on the left\nside of the dialog, in the \"available\" column. It remains stored on your hard disk and can be re-\nloaded again any time you wish to display it. Clicking on a run in the \"loaded\" column will also\nmove it to the top of the list of loaded runs so you can control the order in which runs are listed\nin output such as graphs.\n\nThe control panel also allows you to select a given variable (chose the Variable tab). Modify the\nhorizontal axis of your graphs (the Time Axis tab), and create custom graphs (the Graph tab).\nSee the help menu for more information on all of these features.\n\nVensim also offers another simulation mode, called SyntheSim, to help you analyze your model.\nTo activate Synthesim click on the\nbutton at the top of your screen. When you do this,\nSyntheSim is activated and your screen should now look like this:\n\nAll constants in your model will now appear with sliders while the other variables will have\nsmall graphs superimposed on them showing the behavior of each variable under the current\nslider settings. With Synthesim activated you can change any constant in your model using the\nsliders and Vensim will automatically re-simulate the model and provide updated output.\n\nFor small models such as this one, the response is almost instantaneous. Synthesim can be\nextremely useful in developing intuition as to how your model's behavior changes as its\nunderlying parameters are adjusted. You may wish to use synthesim now to find parameter\nvalues that provide a good fit of your model output to the data for cumulative reported cases.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\n15.871 Introduction to System Dynamics\nFall 2013\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Prepared by MIT System Dynamics Group faculty. Last updated by John Sterman, September 2013.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nSloan School of Management\n\n15.871 Introduction to System Dynamics\nFall 2013\n\nAssignment 2\nProblem Definition and Model Conceptualization\n\nAssigned: Monday, September 16, 2013; Due: Monday, September 23, 2013\nPlease do this assignment in a team totaling three people.\nDesigning and evaluating high-leverage policies demands a long-term, dynamic perspective. The\nanalyst or manager must be able to characterize the strategic problem, including its current\nsymptoms and history. The time horizon should be explicit and must be long enough to include\npossible side effects, delayed responses to policies, and other feedbacks. This assignment\ncultivates your ability to develop a reference mode, a graphical characterization of the patterns of\nproblem behavior over time. The assignment also develops your skill in constructing causal loop\ndiagrams that capture the feedback structure of the system, and your ability to relate the structure\nin a causal map to the problem behavior in the reference mode.\n\nProblem definition involves both textual and graphical statements of problematic behavior.\nConceptualization entails identifying feedback loops that are hypothesized to underlie observed\npatterns of system behavior. Model formulation is the process of moving from a theory of\nunderlying structure to a fully specified mathematical model so that the theory can be tested.\nThis assignment focuses on problem definition and dynamic hypothesis generation. Later\nassignments will bring these skills together with those of formulation and analysis to focus on a\nvariety of strategic and operational problems.\n\nAssignment Guidelines\n\nTeams\nTeams consist of three people. No exceptions.\nMembers of a team may be drawn from either section A or B of the course.\nDo the work together, as a group. While it is tempting to use a \"divide and conquer\"\nstrategy and have each person work on different parts of the assignment, doing so will take\nlonger, lower the quality of your work, and limit what you learn--and therefore your ability\nto complete later assignments. Your dialogue with your teammates as you work through the\nissues will deepen your understanding and improve your work.\nIn the real world, modeling is almost always done in teams including key stakeholders whose\nparticipation is essential for successful implementation. In addition to mastering the technical\nskills of modeling, you must also master the pragmatic skills of group modeling, including\nactive listening, publicly testing your assumptions, and building respect and trust for others.\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 2\n\nHow much should you hand in?\nUse your judgment. Some words of wisdom:\n\"Be careful that you write accurately rather than much.\"\n--Erasmus\nWe don't give higher grades for longer write-ups.\n\"Often must you turn your stylus to erase, if you hope to write something worth a second\nreading.\"\n--Horace\nAllow yourself time for revisions.\n\"What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure.\" --Samuel Johnson\nAnd graded without pleasure.\nWhile your graphs and diagrams should be clear and legible, DO NOT spend your time\ncreating artist-quality presentation graphics. Use your time to think about the issues and\ndevelop your ideas. A legible handwritten diagram you had time to think about is preferable\nto a beautiful computer-generated diagram that took so much time to render you didn't have\ntime to think deeply about its content.\n\nGeneral hints\nBefore starting, review the assigned readings covering causal-loop diagrams as noted in the\nsyllabus, particularly chapters 4 and 5 of Business Dynamics.\n\nEach of your diagrams must fit comfortably and legibly on single page in your writeup.\nDiagrams should include the loops essential in explaining the dynamics, but be simple\nenough to understand. Your client will not understand a diagram that includes everything.\n\nBe sure to follow the conventions and rules for causal diagrams and reference modes\ndescribed in chapters 4 and 5. These include:\nShow the time horizon of graphs explicitly; provide units of measure and scales for all\nvariables.\nLabel the polarity of every link in your causal diagrams.\nIdentify the polarity of the important loops.\nGive the important loops a meaningful name.\nUse variables with a clear sense of direction.\nClearly label your graphs.\n\nOperational thinking and dimensional consistency\nFormulate your causal diagrams so they capture operational realities--the physics and\ndecision making procedures--of the processes you seek to represent. The units of measure\nfor the variables should be obvious and conform to standard practice. In many cases, the\nequation for a key concept should be readily inferred from the causal diagram and units.\nFor example, consider a model of a work process. A key formulation shows how the amount\nof work completed each day is determined. The following diagram states that work\ncompletion rises with resources, effort and skill:\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 2\n\nHowever, the definitions and units of measure for the inputs to the completion rate are\nunclear. Are resources measured in people or dollars or dollars per month? What is \"effort\"\nand how do we measure \"skill\"? A much better diagram is:\n\nEach variable has a clear sense of direction and obvious units of measure. From this\ninformation a reader can easily infer the equation for the Task Completion Rate:\n\nTask Completion Rate = Workers *\nWorkweek\n*\nProductivity\n\n(Tasks/week) (People) *\n(Hours/Week) * (Tasks/Hour/Person)\n\nSubmitting your work: One member of your team should submit your team's write-up\nas a single word document. Make sure the write-up lists the full names of all members of\nyour team.\n\nTask Completion\nRate\nResources\nEffort\nSkill\n+\n+\n+\nTask Completion\nRate\nWorkers\nWorkweek\nProductivity\n+\n+\n+\n\nA. Identifying Feedback Structure of Growth and its Limits (5 points: 1/2 of total)\n\nA1. Identify the reinforcing feedbacks responsible for the exponential growth of the number\nof active Facebook users, shown below (data from Facebook).\n\nDevelop a causal loop diagram capturing the most important reinforcing feedbacks you\nbelieve to be responsible for the astounding growth of Facebook. Limit yourself to no\nmore than four reinforcing feedbacks. In your writeup, provide a one-sentence\nexplanation of each loop.\n\nA2. No real quantity can grow forever. Identify some of the balancing feedbacks that might\neventually stop the growth of Facebook. Add them to your causal diagram. Limit yourself\nto no more than four balancing feedbacks. Provide a one-sentence explanation of each\nloop.\nA3. What is likely to happen to the number of Facebook users in the future? Specifically, use\nyour diagram to suggest what the pattern of development for active Facebook users might\nbe in the future. Draw a graph showing possible futures for the number of active users.\nSelect an appropriate time horizon, and explain your choice briefly. Limit yourself to no\nmore than three possible future paths for subscribers. Name your scenarios.\nUse the feedback structure and other features of your causal diagram (such as delays)\nto assess what the likely behavior of the user base might be. Chapter 4 discusses\ndifferent feedback structures and the various patterns of behavior they can generate.\nA good answer here will explain how the structure you hypothesize generates the\nbehavior you anticipate.\n\nA4. Include in your possible futures graphs showing the likely behavior of other key variables\nin your causal diagram. Provide scales where appropriate.\nThe behavior of the other variables you show should be consistent with the feedback\nloop structure in your diagram. Further, the hypothesized behavior of the variables\nyou graph for each future should form an internally consistent scenario. For example,\nif you argue that Facebook will continue to grow, is it plausible to also show the\nnumber of ads users are forced to endure growing, while content quality and privacy\ndrop?\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 2\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 2\n\nB. Speculative Bubbles and the Sub-prime Mortgage Crisis (5 points; 1/2 of total)\n\nThe US is now slowly emerging from the implosion phase of a great speculative bubble in\nhousing. Yale economist Bob Shiller estimates that real housing prices (prices adjusted for\ngeneral inflation) rose about 80% between 1998 and 2006, a remarkable rate of appreciation that\nmade housing the best investment going. Selected cities, particularly in the sunbelt, experienced\nmuch faster booms (see graph below). Such dramatic price appreciation would normally not be\npossible, as homes would have rapidly become unaffordable for most people, eroding demand\nand limiting prices.\nTo keep demand strong during the boom, however, financial institutions created a wide range of\nnovel mortgage instruments, including interest-only loans, nothing-down loans, balloon payment\nschedules, exploding ARMS--adjustable rate mortgages with initial rates below market and\nmuch higher payments after a few years, and others. Standards to qualify for a mortgage were\nrelaxed as lending institutions reasoned that risk was low--if a buyer could not make the\npayments and defaulted, the bank assumed it could foreclose and sell at a profit due to the\nappreciation in prices that would have occurred in the meantime.\nThe result was a flood of no-doc loans, loans with self-reported and unverified income and\nassets, and even so-called Ninja loans (\"no income, no job, [no] assets\"). Industry insiders spoke\nof \"liar's loans\"--where lenders, in the words of New York Times business columnist Joseph\nNocera, \"practically begged borrowers to fib about their income.\" Mortgage brokers and loan\noriginators chased the fees these loans generated while banks and brokers packaged and resold\nthem to investors around the world in novel forms such as CDOs (collateralized debt\nobligations). Appraisers and the bond rating agencies also received significant fee income, and,\nin some cases, kickbacks, for inflating valuations. Lured by the high profits from fee income and\nflipping properties, the number of mortgage brokers, real estate agents, appraisers, and others in\nthe housing and securitized mortgage sector exploded.\nBut of course the bubble burst. The inventory of unsold properties skyrocketed. Prices fell\nrapidly (see the graph). Housing starts plummeted. Millions of people found they had negative\nequity, with no chance to sell. Some just walked away from their homes, so even legitimate\nlenders started to get \"jingle mail\" where the borrowers simply mailed the keys to the bank and\nstopped paying their mortgages. Many more, especially the working poor, struggled to pay their\ndebts in good faith, only to find that their homes were taken from them in foreclosure. The\nripple effects spilled into world financial markets as hallowed names in the banking and\ninvestment world like Lehman Brothers failed, while others were forced into mergers--Merrill\nLynch, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, many others--and pillars of finance had to be bailed out\nat enormous cost to central banks around the world, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and\nAIG. Worldwide financial collapse was barely averted, despite the injection of massive funds\ninto the banking system, widespread bailouts, short-term interest rates of zero, and fiscal\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 2\n\nstimulus. The contagion spread into the real economy, leading to the worst world economic\ndownturn since the Great Depression. State and federal investigators launched investigations\ninto the many allegations of fraud and abuse (though essentially no one has been sent to jail).\nDuring the crisis the list of defunct lending operations grew weekly (see, e.g., \"the Mortgage\nLender Implode-O-Meter\" at ml-implode.com/).\nHousing presents a spectacular, but by no means unique, example of a speculative bubble. Your\ntask is to identify the feedback structure of speculative bubbles and apply it to the housing crisis.\nRead and do the challenge \"Speculative Bubbles\" on p. 173 of Business Dynamics. That\nchallenge asks you to develop a reference mode (dynamic problem definition) for speculative\nbubbles in general, then expand the basic feedback structure for markets (p. 170) with the\nfeedbacks contributing to speculative bubbles described by JS Mill. For this assignment, you\nshould tailor your analysis to represent key features of the housing bubble. Specifically,\nB1. Make a list of the most important variables or concepts characterizing the housing\nbubble. Keep your list short (eight or fewer). Aggregate similar concepts where possible (e.g.,\ndo not represent different types of housing separately, or different types of mortgages: a broad\nboundary is more important than disaggregate detail).\nB2. Use the description above and your own knowledge to graph the behavior of the key\nvariables you identified. First, identify the time horizon over which the dynamics unfold. Select\na time horizon long enough to capture the dynamics of the critical variables throughout the\nbubble, including the past development and enough of the future for the dynamics to play out.\nNext, sketch a graph showing the behavior for each variable over the time horizon you identified.\nIf two or more variables have the same units of measure, plot them on the same scale. For\nexample, in a model of a business one would show revenue and cost on the same graph so that\nthe difference between them (profit) can be easily seen. Qualitative patterns are more important\nthan numerical precision in the early stages of problem definition. You do not need to go to the\nweb or other sources to find data. Include your reference modes in your write-up.\nB3. Develop a causal diagram that captures the feedbacks you believe are responsible for the\nhousing bubble. Your diagram should have, at its core, the basic feedback structure regulating\ndemand and supply in markets (Business Dynamics, p. 170). Then add the most important\nfeedbacks you believe are operating in the housing bubble.\nTo get your causal diagram started it is useful to ask yourself \"what is the rationale for the\ndecisions of each actor in the system?\" That is, what is the intended rationality or intended\noutcome of the decision to buy a home? To sell? To build? To Lend? For example, one\nmotivation for buyers is to provide a roof over one's head, but a house can also be viewed as\nan investment with the potential for capital gains. Similarly, what factors would motivate\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 2\n\ndevelopers to start new housing construction (see graph below of US residential\nconstruction).\nBe sure to show important time delays, including delays in physical processes, in the\nmeasurement and reporting of information, and in the change in perceptions and beliefs.\nSelecting an appropriate boundary is a critical skill in modeling. You need a boundary broad\nenough to include the key feedbacks but not so broad that your model becomes\noverwhelming. While the effects of the housing bubble and crash rippled out to affect world\nfinancial markets, economic output and employment, do not attempt to develop a global\nmacroeconomic model. Keep your model focused on the core dynamics responsible for the\nhousing bubble. Remember that while the specifics of the housing market may have differed\nin this episode compared to previous bubbles, the feedback structure underlying all\nspeculative bubbles is the same.\nB4. Using your diagram, briefly explain the genesis of the bubble. What caused the bubble to\nburst? What policies might have prevented or moderated the bubble? What policies might have\nmitigated the harm it caused? What policies might prevent such a bubble from happening again?\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 2\n\nCase-Shiller home price index.\nSource: http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2013/04/case-shiller-home-prices-rise-in-february-2013/\n\nUS Residential Construction:\nSource: US Census Bureau.

      "content": "Prepared by MIT System Dynamics Group faculty. Last updated September 2013.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nSloan School of Management\n\n15.871 Introduction to System Dynamics\nFall 2013\n\nAssignment 3\nMapping the Stock and Flow Structure of Systems\n\nAssigned: Monday September 23, 2013; Due: Monday September 30, 2013\nPlease do this assignment in a team totaling three people.\n\nThis assignment gives you practice with the structure and dynamics of stocks and flows. Stocks\nand flows are the building blocks from which every dynamic system is constructed. The ability\nto identify, map, and understand the dynamics of the networks of stocks and flows in a system is\nessential to understanding the processes of interest in any modeling effort.\n\nBe sure you have carefully read Ch. 6 and 7 of Business Dynamics before doing this\nassignment.\nSubmitting your work: One member of your team should submit your team's write up\nand model on the course website, as a single zip file containing a word document and a\nVensim mdl file. Make sure the write up lists the full names of all members of your team.\n\nA.\nIdentifying Stock and Flow Variables\n\nThe distinction between stocks and flows is crucial for understanding the source of dynamics. In\nphysical systems it is usually obvious which variables are stocks and which are flows. In human\nand social systems, often characterized by intangible, \"soft\" variables, identification may be\nmore difficult.\n\nA1. For each of the following variables, state whether it is a stock or a flow, and give units of\nmeasure for each.\n\nName\nType\nUnits\nExample: Inventory of beer\nStock\nCases\nExample: Beer order rate\nFlow\nCases/week\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 3\n\nName\nType\nUnits\n1.\nDaily Sales of the iPhone 5S\n\n2.\nUS National Debt\n\n3.\nChina's trade surplus\n\n4.\nEmployee experience\n\n5.\nAccounts Payable\n\n6.\nCollege athletes declaring their intention to\nturn professional\n\n7.\nBook value of inventory\n\n8.\nPromotion of Senior Associates to Partner\nat a consulting firm\n\n9.\nFans of Lance Armstrong\n\n10.\nEuro/dollar exchange rate\n\n11.\nEmployee morale\n\n12.\nGreenhouse gas emissions of the US\n\n13.\nInterest rate on 30-year US Treasury Bond\n\n14.\nRunners passing the finish line\n\n15.\nFirm's cost of goods sold (COGS)\n\nB.\nMapping Stock and Flow Networks\n\nSystems are composed of interconnected networks of stocks and flows. Modelers must be able\nto represent the stock and flow networks of people, material, goods, money, energy, etc. from\nwhich systems are built.\n\nFor each of the following cases, construct a stock and flow diagram that properly maps the stock\nand flow networks described.\nNot all the variables are connected by physical flows; they may be linked by information\nflows, as in the example below.\nYou may need to add additional stocks or flows beyond those specified to complete your\ndiagram (but keep it simple). Be sure to consider the boundary of your stock and flow map.\nThat is, what are the sources and sinks for the stock and flow networks? Are you tracking\nsources and sinks far enough upstream and downstream? This process of deciding how far\nto extend the stock and flow network is called \"challenging the clouds\" because you\nquestion whether the clouds are in fact unlimited sources or sinks.\nConsider the units of measure for your variables and make sure they are consistent within\neach stock and flow chain.\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 3\n\nExample: A manufacturing firm maintains an inventory of finished goods from which it ships to\ncustomers. Customer orders are filled after a delay caused by order processing, credit checks, etc.\nMap the stock and flow structure, drawing on the following variables: Inventory, Raw Materials,\nProduction, Order Backlog, Order Rate.\nSolution:\nWidgets\nper Order\nOrder\nFulfillment\nRate\nOrder Rate\nShipment\nRate\nProduction\nRate\nMaterial\nArrival Rate\nOrder Backlog\nInventory\nRaw Materials\nThe unit of measure in this flow is widgets / time period.\nThe unit of measure in this flow is orders / time period.\nThese are information links.\n\nComment: There are two linked stock and flow networks here: first, the physical flow of materials\nas they are fabricated into products and shipped to customers; second, the flow of orders. The two\nnetworks are linked because there is a direct relationship between physical shipments and order\nfulfillment (assuming no accounting glitches or inventory shrinkage!)--every time a product is\nphysically shipped, the order is removed from the backlog and denoted as filled. The link between\nthe Shipment Rate and Order Fulfillment Rate is an information link, not a material flow. Note that\nconsidering the units of measure helps identify the linkages between the two stock and flow chains.\nUnits:\n-\nAll flows in the materials chain: widgets/time period\n-\nMaterials and inventory stocks: widgets\n-\nOrder flows: orders/time period\n-\nOrder fulfillment rate: order/time period (since it is the number of widgets shipped per period\ndivided by the number of widgets per order).\n\nOnly the information links directly connecting the stock and flow networks are captured. Other\ninformation links that must exist are not represented. For example, the shipment rate must depend on\nthe finished goods inventory (no inventory--no shipments). The purpose of this exercise, however, is\nto map the stocks and flows, so these feedbacks can be omitted for now. Note that the shipment rate,\nmaterial arrival rate, and order fulfillment rate were not included in the group of variables listed in\nthe description but must be introduced to complete the stock-and-flow network. Also, the solution\nomits some structure that might be added if the purpose of the model required it, such as inventory\nshrinkage and order cancellation flows and the installed base of product (the stock filled up by\nshipments). The model could be disaggregated further, e.g., splitting the order backlog into two\nstocks, \"orders awaiting credit approval,\" and \"orders approved.\" The choice of detail is always\ngoverned by the purpose of the model.\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 3\n\nB1. Firms often have great difficulty bringing new products to market on time and with the\nquality and functionality customers demand. Map the stocks and flows of the new\nproduct development process for a typical high-tech firm. Product development includes\nthe following stages: concept generation, detailed design, prototyping, testing, and\nlaunch. At each stage, projects are evaluated, with some continuing on and the rest\ncancelled.\n\nDon't forget to 'challenge the clouds' in this example. What happens after new\nproducts are launched? How long do new products remain on the market?\n\nB2. A computer manufacturer maintains a large call center operation to handle customer\ninquiries. Customers with questions or problems call a toll free number for help. In this\nfirm, incoming calls are answered by a voice recognition system that routes calls to an\nautomated system or, if the customer elects, to a live customer service representative\n(CSR). Calls default to the automated system but customers can, at any time, press \"0\"\nor say \"representative\" to speak to a CSR, or, of course, hang up. Callers electing to\nspeak to a CSR may be placed on hold until an agent becomes available. If the call is\nanswered before the customer gets frustrated and hangs up, the CSR may be able to\nresolve the issue. Often, however, the CSR is unable to solve the problem and forwards\nthe call to a supervisor or specialized department such as technical support. The issue\nmay or may not be resolved by these specialists. Map the stock and flow structure of\ncalls as they flow through the system.\n\nIn reality, customer inquiries arrive by phone, by email, and by live chat from the\nfirm's website. You don't need to consider these channels separately. Likewise, do\nnot attempt to separate inbound calls into different categories such as billing\nproblems or tech support questions. Assume there is a single flow of calls coming\nin to the system. These calls are then divided into those electing the automated\nsystem and those electing to speak to an agent.\n\nC.\nDynamics of Accumulation\n\nStocks are accumulations. The difference between the inflows and outflows of a stock\naccumulates, altering the level of the stock variable. The process of accumulation gives stocks\ninertia and memory and creates delays. Since realistic models are far too complex to solve with\nformal analysis, it is important to understand the relationship between flows and the behavior of\nstocks intuitively.\n\nThe goal is to develop your intuition about stocks and flows. Be sure to read Chapter 7 first.\nConsider the following system:\nStock\nInflow\nOutflow\n\nC1. The top graph below shows the behavior of the two flows, or rates: the inflow (the solid\nline) and outflow (dashed line) for the stock. On the graph provided below, draw the\ntrajectory of the stock given the inflow and outflow rates shown. Indicate the numerical\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 3\n\nvalues for any maxima or minima, and for the maximum or minimum values of the slope\nfor the stock. Assume the initial quantity in the stock is 100 units.\n\nUnits/Time\nOutflow\nInflow\nTime\n\nStock\n\n-100\n-50\nUnits\nTime\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 3\n\nD.\nModeling Goal-Seeking Processes\nAll goal-seeking processes consist of balancing (negative) feedback loops. In a balancing loop,\nthe system state is compared to a goal, and the gap or discrepancy is assessed. Corrective actions\nrespond to the sign and magnitude of the gap, bringing the state of the system in line with the\ngoal.\nFor example, consider programs designed to improve the quality of a process in a company. The\nprocess could be in manufacturing, administration, product development--any activity within the\norganization. Improvement activity is iterative. Members of an improvement team identify\nsources of defects in a process, often ranking benefits of correcting them using a Pareto chart.\nThey then design ways to eliminate the source of the defect, and try experiments until a solution\nis found. They then move on to the next most critical source of defects. Quality professionals\nrefer to this iterative cycle as the \"Plan--Do--Check--Act\" or \"PDCA\" cycle (also known as\nthe Deming cycle, for the late quality guru W. Edwards Deming). In the PDCA process, the\nimprovement team: (1) plans an experiment to test an improvement idea, (2) does the\nexperiment, (3) checks to see if it works, then (4) acts--either planning a new experiment if the\nfirst one failed or implementing the solution and then planning new experiments to eliminate\nother sources of defects. The team continues to cycle around the PDCA loop, successively\naddressing and correcting root causes of defects in the process. This learning loop is not unique\nto TQM: All learning and improvement programs, including Six Sigma, follow an iterative\nprocess similar to the PDCA cycle.\n\nThe figure below shows data on defects from the wafer fabrication process of a mid-size\nsemiconductor firm (from Figure 4-5 in Business Dynamics). The firm began its TQM program\nin 1987, when defects were running at a rate of roughly 1500 parts per million (ppm). After the\nimplementation of TQM, the defect rate fell dramatically, until by 1991 defects seem to reach a\nnew equilibrium close to 150 ppm--a spectacular factor-of-ten improvement. Note that the\ndecline is rapid at first, then slows as the number of defects falls.\n\nD1. Create a model of the improvement process described above and compare its behavior to\nthe data for the semiconductor firm. Once you have formulated your model, make sure\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 3\n\nthe units of each equation are consistent. Hand in your final documented Vensim model\nfile (.mdl file).\nFollow the instructions below precisely. Do not add structure beyond that specified.\n- The state of the system is the defect rate, measured in ppm. The defect rate in 1987\nwas 1500 ppm.\nThe defect rate is not a rate of flow, but a stock characterizing the state of the\nsystem--in this case, the ratio of the number of defective dies to the number\nproduced.\n- The defect rate decreases when the improvement team identifies and eliminates a root\ncause of defects. Denote this outflow the \"Defect Elimination Rate.\"\n- The rate of defect elimination depends on the number of defects that can be\neliminated by application of the improvement process and the average time required\nto eliminate defects.\n- The number of defects that can be eliminated is the difference between the current\ndefect rate and the theoretical minimum defect rate. The theoretical minimum rate of\ndefect generation varies with the process you are modeling and how you define\n\"defect.\" For many processes, the theoretical minimum is zero (for example, the\ntheoretical minimum rate of late deliveries is zero). For other processes, the\ntheoretical minimum is greater than zero (for example, even under the best\nimaginable circumstances, the time required to build a house or the cycle time for\nsemiconductor fabrication will be greater than zero). In this case, assume the\ntheoretical minimum defect level is zero.\n- The average time required to eliminate defects for this process in this company is\nestimated to be about 0.75 years (9 months). The average improvement time is a\nfunction of how much improvement can be achieved on average on each iteration of\nthe PDCA cycle, and by the PDCA cycle time. The more improvement achieved\neach cycle, and the more cycles carried out each year, the shorter the average time\nrequired to eliminate defects will be. These parameters are determined by the\ncomplexity of the process and the time required to design and carry out experiments.\nIn a semiconductor fab, the processes are moderately complex and the time required\nto run experiments is determined by the time needed to run a wafer through the\nfabrication process and analyze the results. Data collected by the firm prior to the\nstart of the TQM program suggested the 9 month time was reasonable.\n- Equipment wear, changes in equipment, turnover of employees, and changes in the\nproduct mix can introduce new sources of defects. The defect introduction rate is\nestimated to be constant at 250 ppm per year.\n\nD2. Run your model with the base case parameters, and hand in the plot.\na. Briefly describe the model's behavior.\nb. How well does your simulation match the historical data? Are the differences likely to be\nimportant if your goal is to understand the dynamics of process improvement and to\ndesign effective improvement programs?\n\nIntroduction to system dynamics 15.871 Assignment 3\n\nc. Does the stock of defects reach equilibrium after 9 months (the average defect\nelimination time)? Referring to the structures in your model, explain why or why not.\n\nD3. Experiment with different values for the average defect elimination time. What role does\nthe defect elimination time play in influencing the behavior of other variables?\n\nD4. The stock reaches equilibrium when its inflows equal its outflows. Set up that equation\nand solve for the equilibrium defect rate in terms of the other parameters.\na. What determines the equilibrium (final) level of defects? Why?\nb. Does the equilibrium defect rate depend on the average time required to eliminate\ndefects? Why/Why not?\n\nD5. Explore the sensitivity of your model's results to the choice of the time step or \"dt\" (for\n\"delta time\").\nBefore answering this question, read Appendix A in Business Dynamics.\n\na. Change the time step for your model from 0.125 years to 0.0625 years. Do you see a\nsubstantial difference in the behavior?\nb. What happens when dt equals 0.5 years? Why does the model behave as it does?\nc. What happens when dt equals 1 year? Why does the simulation behave this way?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\n15.871 Introduction to System Dynamics\nFall 2013\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "PART B. Mapping Stock and Flow Networks\n\nA manufacturing plant such as an oil refinery or assembly line has many thousands of\nmachines and tools that require maintenance. The goal of maintenance is to maximize\nequipment availability (up time) while keeping maintenance costs low. Consider all the\npumps in a chemical manufacturing plant. A typical plant might have several thousand\npumps. Pumps are either running, in working condition and available to run if needed,\nbroken down and awaiting repair, under repair, or taken down for preventive maintenance.\nMap the stock and flow structure relating these various states.\n\nPART D. Modeling Goal-Seeking Processes\n\nHVAC system maintains constant temperature of the room. At some point in time, due to\nthe peak load in the grid, the electricity goes out and the temperature in the room starts\nrising until it reaches the outside level. Consider for simplicity that outside temperature is\nconstant and equal to 90F. Waiting for utility company to fix the blackout, people begin to\nrecord the temperature in the room.\nTime after electricity went out, hr\nTemperature inside the room, F\n\nWhat information can you get from this table? Hint: think about half-life.\n1) Build a simple Vensim model simulating the process of increasing temperature in the\nroom following exponential decay process.\n2) Using the same model, predict what would happen to the same room in wintertime if\nthe heating were broken. Assume initial room temperature is 70F and the outside\ntemperature is constant and is 30F. In how many hours would the room temperature\nreach 50F?\n\nPART C: Dynamics of Accumulation\n\nGraphically integrate the inflow and outflow rates: Draw the behavior of the stock called Level,\ngiven the rates Inflow and Outflow. Provide a short explanation for the behavior you draw.\n\nPART B SOLUTION:\nPumps are either running, in working condition and available to run if needed,\nbroken down and awaiting repair, under repair, or taken down for preventive\nmaintenance.\n\nRunning\nPumps\nWorking and\nAvailable\nPumps\nBroken and\nAwaiting\nRepair\nUnder Repair\nPumps in\nPrev Maint\nTake Down for\nPM\nReturn to Service\nfrom PM\nBreak Down Rate\nRepair Starts\nReturn to Service\nfrom Repair\nPutting in Service\nPutting in Reserve\nReturn to Reserve\nfrom Repair\nReserve Sent to\nPM\n\nPART C SOLUTION:\n\nPART D. SOLUTION\nHalf-life of the temperature increase is 10 hours (from the table, as initial gap was\n20F and half of it was closed in 10 hours, second line is confirmation of this).

Brevity is a virtue! (~10-12 pages should be enough)\n- Hint: Main Elements to include in your report:\n- 1) Identify Key Variables: Variable List with units*\n- 2) Reference modes*\n- 3) Develop a \"ONE PAGE\" causal loop diagram including key variables****\n- 4) Explanation of PE strategy**\n- Telling the PE Story in \"A Few Paragraphs\" :\n- 5) Explanation of Your Strategy**:\n- Policy Recommendations: Imagine You are CEO of PE; What\npolicies/strategies would you propose to ensure the sustainable success of\nyour firm?\n- 6) Strategy record sheet: Your decisions made per quarter, up to 10 years\n- Recommended: Include a picture of tables->user decisions, so that we can\neasily see the decisions you made. Last page of assignment is the graphical\npresentation of this table.\n** Important: Refer to your CLD to tell the story of PE and your strategy\n* More details will follow after the PE flight simulator walk through\n\nRemember: Developing reference\nmodes\n- Identify the time horizon explicitly\n- Be homogeneous in all the charts so that it is easy to compare charts and analyze\nrelationships\n- Use different charts for different variables with different units\n- It simplifies the analysis of the reference modes\n- Use the same chart only when you want to illustrate explicit relationships\n(Revenues vs. costs => profit; Input-Output => Excess production or Change in\ninventory)\n- You need to be consistent across the graphs\n- Example: if Input>Output at some point, Inventory has to grow\n- Find a rationale for every feature in the reference mode you describe\n- E.g. \"Cable Revenues go down because Subscription Fee goes down\"\n- The rationale will help you find and test the causal loop structure underlying the\nsystem\naterial and examples based on \"Business Dynamics\", Chapter 5 read the book for more information\nM\n\nExample Reference modes\n(variables are different than the People Express assignment)\nCustomer Base\nCable Provider Revenues\nMillion\n$Bn/Year\nHouseholds\n\nRemember: Defining causal loops\n- Name all the variables in a convenient, meaningful way, which is measurable\nWrong\nRight\n+\n+\n1.\nCosts rise\nPrice rises\nVs.\nCosts\nPrice\n+\n+\n2.\nFeedback\nMental attitude\nVs.\nPraise\nMorale\n+\n-\n3.\nCosts\nLosses\nVs.\nCosts\nProfits\n+\n-\n4.\nCriticism\nUnhappiness\nVs.\nCriticism\nHappiness\nMaterial and examples based on \"Business Dynamics\", Chapter 5\n\nRemember: Defining causal loops\n- Make the loops easy to see\n- Curved arrows help visualize the loops\n- Try not to have many crossed lines\n- Don't box the variables ! (at least, at this stage of the course. Boxes mean stock\nvariables)\n+\n+\nRoad\nChickens\nEggs\n+\n+\ncrossings\nB\n-\n+\nRoad Crossings\nChickens\nR\nEggs\nroad killing\n-\n+\nreproduction\n- Assign polarity to all the links!!!\nMaterial and examples based on \"Business Dynamics\", Chapter 5\n\nRemember: Defining causal loops\n- Use the right way (not the fast way) to find the nature of the loops\n- It helps you debug the model (e.g. typos in the polarity of links)\n- It strengthens your understanding of the model\n- It helps you draw reference modes\n- Name your loops\n1. Indicating if it is reinforcing (R) or balancing (B)\n2. Numbering them (R1, R2, B1, B2..)\n3. Labeling them with a meaningful sentence (Word of mouth, Inventory\ndepletion, etc ...)\nMaterial and examples based on \"Business Dynamics\", Chapter 5\n\nOverview of Flight Simulator\n- Simulator consists of 3 parts:\n- The micro-world: Represents structure of PE\n- The information system: Reporting current state and the past\n- The simulator controls: Strategic and operational decisions\n- .\n\nCleared for Take-Off\n- Before you enter your first decisions, let's take a look at some of the reports available\nthrough the Information system.\n- Under the Report menu you will find 7 status reports. Click on the Summary\nReport. This report summarizes the crucial information you will need to run your\nairline.\n- Take a look at some other reports if you wish.\n- The current date is reported at the top of the Summary window.\n- You are taking over at the beginning of \"Year 1\". Thus the summary report gives you\nthe results for the last quarter of \"Year 0\".\n- When you take over, People Express has 3 aircrafts, and 165 employees, or 55\nemployees per plane. Reported service quality is high.\n\nGame 1: Play Don Burr's strategy\n- Good starting point is to mimic Don Burr:\n- Keep prices low from the beginning ($0.09/ seat mile)\n- Set the target scope low at 0.60\n- Then expand fleet aggressively (about 100%/year)\n- Hire people at a comparable rate\n- You would also market aggressively, particularly in the beginning (say, 12% of\nrevenues in the beginning, falling to 10% as load factor rises)\n-----------------------------\n- After playing Burr, play again with same price and service scope, but choose\ndifferent growth rate, or a different marketing strategy, or a different target for\nemployees per aircraft\n- As you start understanding dynamics of the firm, consequences of actions, and\ndelays, you can design your strategy for success\n- There is no right answer, careful experimentation is key\n\nHelpful Hints\n1. You may sell airplanes as well as buy them. To sell airplanes, simply enter a\nnegative number for the purchase rate. The software will not allow you to sell more than\nyou have..\n2. You may fire employees as well as hire them. Simply enter a negative number for\nhiring. You may not fire more employees than you have.\n3. Think of strategies, run them. See why they work/ fail. Which loops made it work,\nwhich loops did you miss..don't spend too much time on one run, just play again, as\nmany times as possible\n4. Remember there can be delays, so behavior can be complex\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\n15.871 Introduction to System Dynamics\nFall 2013\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
