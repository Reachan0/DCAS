Such imitation is called categorification. The very notion of a category is a categorification, in this sense, of the notion of a set. Further, monoidal categories categorify monoids, and tensor categories (i.e., monoidal categories with a compatible additive structure), categorify associative rings.\n\nTensor categories are ubiquitous in mathematics. They arise in representation theory (representation categories of classical and quantum groups), algebraic geometry (categories of coherent sheaves on algebraic varieties, categories of local systems, categories of motives), topology (topological quantum field theory, invariants of knots, links, and 3-manifolds) the theory of operator algebras (bimodule categories for subfactors), 2-dimensional conformal field theory (fusion categories of modules over a vertex operator algebra), quantum statistical mechanics (nonabelian anyons in the quantum Hall effect), etc.\n\nThis course will be an attempt to give a detailed introduction to the theory of tensor categories and to review some of its connections to other subjects, time permitting (with a focus on representation-theoretic applications). In particular, we will discuss categorifications of such notions from ring theory as: module, morphism of modules, Morita equivalence of rings, commutative ring, the center of a ring, the centralizer of a subring, the double centralizer property, graded ring, etc.\n\nTopics\n\nWe will develop from scratch the theory of monoidal and tensor categories and module categories, covering the following topics:\n\nMonoidal categories: the definition, MacLane's coherence theorem, monoidal functors and their natural transformations, equivalence of monoidal categories, rigid monoidal categories, pivotal and spherical categories, dimensions, examples (Hopf algebras/quantum groups).\n\nTensor categories: Grothendieck rings, fiber functors and reconstruction theory for Hopf algebras.\n\nTensor categories with finitely many simple objects, Frobenius-Perron dimensions, fusion categories, examples.\n\nModule categories: the definition, examples, properties, algebras in categories, categories of module functors, dual categories. Morita equivalence of tensor categories.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore beginning this course, you are expected to know basic category theory, basic algebra, and fundamentals of group representations. Hopf algebras will often appear in the course, but no previous knowledge of them is expected.\n\nAssignments\n\nThere will be five homework problem sets assigned during the course.

Etingof at MIT in the spring of 2009.\nIn these notes we will assume that the reader is familiar with the\nbasic theory of categories and functors; a detailed discussion of this\ntheory can be found in the book [ML]. We will also assume the basics\nof the theory of abelian categories (for a more detailed treatment see\nthe book [F]).\nIf C is a category, the notation X ∈C will mean that X is an object\nof C, and the set of morphisms between X, Y ∈C will be denoted by\nHom(X, Y ).\nThroughout the notes, for simplicity we will assume that the ground\nfield k is algebraically closed unless otherwise specified, even though in\nmany cases this assumption will not be needed.\n\n1. Monoidal categories\n1.1. The definition of a monoidal category. A good way of think\ning about category theory (which will be especially useful throughout\nthese notes) is that category theory is a refinement (or \"categorifica\ntion\") of ordinary algebra. In other words, there exists a dictionary\nbetween these two subjects, such that usual algebraic structures are\nrecovered from the corresponding categorical structures by passing to\nthe set of isomorphism classes of objects.\nFor example, the notion of a (small) category is a categorification of\nthe notion of a set. Similarly, abelian categories are a categorification\nof abelian groups 1 (which justifies the terminology).\nThis dictionary goes surprisingly far, and many important construc\ntions below will come from an attempt to enter into it a categorical\n\"translation\" of an algebraic notion.\nIn particular, the notion of a monoidal category is the categorification\nof the notion of a monoid.\nRecall that a monoid may be defined as a set C with an associative\nmultiplication operation (x, y)\nx\ny (i.e., a semigroup), with an\n→\n·\nelement 1 such that 12 = 1 and the maps 1\n1 : C\nC are bijections.\n·, ·\n→\nIt is easy to show that in a semigroup, the last condition is equivalent\nto the usual unit axiom 1 x = x 1 = x.\n·\n·\nAs usual in category theory, to categorify the definition of a monoid,\nwe should replace the equalities in the definition of a monoid (namely,\nthe associativity equation (xy)z = x(yz) and the equation 12 = 1)\nby isomorphisms satisfying some consistency properties, and the word\n\"bijection\" by the word \"equivalence\" (of categories). This leads to\nthe following definition.\nDefinition 1.1.1. A monoidal category is a quintuple (C, ⊗, a, 1, ι)\nwhere C is a category, ⊗ : C × C →C is a bifunctor called the tensor\nproduct\nbifunctor,\n→- ⊗ (- ⊗-) is a functorial isomorphism:\na : - ⊗ (- ⊗-) -\n∼\n(1.1.1)\naX,Y,Z : (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z\n∼X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z),\nX, Y, Z ∈C\n-→\ncalled the associativity constraint (or associativity isomorphism), 1 ∈C\nis an object of C, and ι : 1 ⊗ 1\n1 is an isomorphism, subject to the\n→\nfollowing two axioms.\n1To be more precise, the set of isomorphism classes of objects in a (small) abelian\ncategory C is a commutative monoid, but one usually extends it to a group by\nconsidering \"virtual objects\" of the form X - Y , X, Y ∈C.\n\nt\n* *\n\no o\n1. The pentagon axiom. The diagram\n(1.1.2)\niiiiiiiiiiii\n((\nii\nW\nii ⊗ X) ⊗ Y )U⊗UUZ\nUUUUUUUUUUUUU\naW ⊗X,Y,Z\naW,X,Y ⊗IdZ\n(W ⊗ X) ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)\n(W ⊗ (X ⊗ Y )) ⊗ Z\naW,X,Y ⊗Z\naW,X⊗Y,Z\nW ⊗ (X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z))\nIdW ⊗aX,Y,Z\nW ⊗ ((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z)\nis commutative for all objects W, X, Y, Z in C.\n2. The unit axiom. The functors L1 and R1 of left and right\nmultiplication by 1 are equivalences C →C.\nThe pair (1, ι) is called the unit object of C. 2\nWe see that the set of isomorphism classes of objects in a small\nmonoidal category indeed has a natural structure of a monoid, with\nmultiplication ⊗ and unit 1. Thus, in the categorical-algebraic dic\ntionary, monoidal categories indeed correspond to monoids (which ex\nplains their name).\nDefinition 1.1.2. A monoidal subcategory of a monoidal category\n(C, ⊗, a, 1, ι) is a quintuple (D, ⊗, a, 1, ι), where D ⊂C is a subcate\ngory closed under the tensor product of objects and morphisms and\ncontaining 1 and ι.\nDefinition 1.1.3. The opposite monoidal category Cop to C is the cate\ngory C with reversed order of tensor product and inverted associativity\nsomorphism.\nRemark 1.1.4. The notion of the opposite monoidal category is not\nto be confused with the usual notion of the opposite category, which is\nthe category C∨ obtained from C by reversing arrows (for any category\nC). Note that if C is monoidal, so is C∨ (in a natural way), which makes\nit even easier to confuse the two notions.\n1.2. Basic properties of unit objects in monoidal categories.\nLet (C, ⊗, a, 1, ι) be a monoidal category. Define the isomorphism lX :\n1 ⊗ X\nX by the formula\n→\nlX = L-\n1((ι ⊗ Id) * a-\n1,\n1,X ),\nand the isomorphism rX : X ⊗ 1\nX by the formula\n→\nrX = R1\n-1((Id ⊗ ι) * aX,1,1).\n2We note that there is no condition on the isomorphism ι, so it can be chosen\narbitrarily.\n\n' '\nw\n/ /\n* *\nt\n\n4 4\nO O\nj\njjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\ntjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\nThis gives rise to functorial isomorphisms l : L1\nIdC and r : R1\n→\n→\nIdC . These isomorphisms are called the unit constraints or unit iso\nmorphisms. They provide the categorical counterpart of the unit ax\niom 1X = X1 = X of a monoid in the same sense as the associativity\nisomorphism provides the categorical counterpart of the associativity\nequation.\nProposition 1.2.1. The \"triangle\" diagram\naX,1,Y\n(1.2.1)\n(X ⊗ 1) ⊗ Y\n� X ⊗ (1 ⊗ Y )\nOOOOOOOOOOO\nooooooooooo\nrX ⊗IdY\nIdX ⊗lY\nX ⊗ Y\nis commutative for all X, Y ∈C. In particular, one has r1 = l1 = ι.\nProof. This follows by applying the pentagon axiom for the quadruple\nof objects X, 1, 1, Y . More specifically, we have the following diagram:\n(1.2.2)\n((X ⊗ 1) ⊗ 1) ⊗ Y\naX,1,1⊗Id\n(X ⊗ (1 ⊗ 1)) ⊗ Y\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\njjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\nrX ⊗Id⊗Id\n(Id⊗ι)⊗Id\n(X ⊗ 1) ⊗ Y\naX⊗1,1,Y\naX,1,Y\naX,1⊗1,Y\nX ⊗ (1 ⊗ Y )\nrX ⊗Id\n(X ⊗ 1) ⊗ (1 ⊗ Y )\naX,1,1⊗Y\n�\nId⊗(ι⊗Id)\nId⊗l1⊗Y\nX ⊗ ((1 ⊗ 1) ⊗ Y )\nId⊗a1,1,Y\nX ⊗ (1 ⊗ (1 ⊗ Y ))\nTo prove the proposition, it suffices to establish the commutativity\nof the bottom left triangle (as any object of C is isomorphic to one of\nthe form 1 ⊗ Y ). Since the outside pentagon is commutative (by the\npentagon axiom), it suffices to establish the commutativity of the other\nparts of the pentagon. Now, the two quadrangles are commutative due\nto the functoriality of the associativity isomorphisms, the commutativ\nity of the upper triangle is the definition of r, and the commutativity\nof the lower right triangle is the definition of l.\nThe last statement is obtained by setting X = Y = 1 in (1.2.1).\n\n' '\nw\n' '\nw\n\n4 4\nO O\nj\njjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\ntjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\nProposition 1.2.2.

Consider the diagram\n(1.2.5)\n((X ⊗ 1) ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z\naX,1,Y ⊗Id\n� (X ⊗ (1 ⊗ Y )) ⊗ Z\n(rX ⊗Id)⊗Id\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\njjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\n�\n(Id⊗lY )⊗Id\n(X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z\naX⊗1,Y,Z\naX,Y,Z\naX,1⊗Y,Z\nX ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)\nrX ⊗Id\n(X ⊗ 1) ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)\naX,1,Y ⊗Z\n�\nId⊗(lY ⊗Id)\nId⊗lY ⊗Z\nX ⊗ ((1 ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z)\nId⊗a1,Y,Z\nX ⊗ (1 ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z))\nwhere X, Y, Z are objects in C. The outside pentagon commutes by\nthe pentagon axiom (1.1.2). The functoriality of a implies the com\nmutativity of the two middle quadrangles. The triangle axiom (1.2.1)\nimplies the commutativity of the upper triangle and the lower left tri\nangle. Consequently, the lower right triangle commutes as well. Setting\nX = 1 and applying the functor L-\n1 to the lower right triangle, we\nobtain commutativity of the triangle (1.2.3). The commutativity of the\ntriangle (1.2.4) is proved similarly.\n\nProposition 1.2.3. For any object X in C one has the equalities\nl1⊗X = Id ⊗ lX and rX⊗1 = rX ⊗ Id.\n\n/ /\n\n/ /\n\nProof. It follows from the functoriality of l that the following diagram\ncommutes\n(1.2.6)\n1 ⊗ (1 ⊗ X)\nId⊗lX\n1 ⊗ X\nlX\nl1⊗X\n1 ⊗ X\n� X\nlX\nSince lX is an isomorphism, the first identity follows. The second iden\ntity follows similarly from the functoriality of r.\n\nProposition 1.2.4. The unit object in a monoidal category is unique\nup to a unique isomorphism.\nProof. Let (1, ι), (10, ι0) be two unit objects. Let (r, l), (r0, l0) be the\ncorresponding unit constraints. Then we have the isomorphism η :=\nl10 * (r1\n0 )-1 : 1 → 10.\nIt is easy to show using commutativity of the above triangle diagrams\nthat η maps ι to ι0. It remains to show that η is the only isomorphism\nwith this property. To do so, it suffices to show that if b : 1\n1 is an\n→\nisomorphism such that the diagram\n(1.2.7)\n1 ⊗ 1\nb⊗b / 1 ⊗ 1\nι\nι\n� 1\nb\nis commutative, then b = Id. To see this, it suffices to note that for\nany morphism c : 1\n1 the diagram\n→\n(1.2.8)\n1 ⊗ 1\nc⊗Id 1 ⊗ 1\nι\nι\n� 1\nc\nis commutative (as ι = r1), so b ⊗ b = b ⊗ Id and hence b = Id.\n\nExercise 1.2.5. Verify the assertion in the proof of Proposition 1.2.4\nthat η maps ι to ι0.\nHint. Use Propositions 1.2.1 and 1.2.2.\nThe results of this subsection show that a monoidal category can be\nalternatively defined as follows:\nDefinition 1.2.6. A monoidal category is a sextuple (C, ⊗, a, 1, l, r)\nsatisfying the pentagon axiom (1.1.2) and the triangle axiom (1.2.1).\n\nThis definition is perhaps more traditional than Definition 1.1.1, but\nDefinition 1.1.1 is simpler. Besides, Proposition 1.2.4 implies that for\na triple (C, ⊗, a) satisfying a pentagon axiom (which should perhaps\nbe called a \"semigroup category\", as it categorifies the notion of a\nsemigroup), being a monoidal category is a property and not a structure\n(similarly to how it is for semigroups and monoids).\nFurthermore, one can show that the commutativity of the triangles\nimplies that in a monoidal category one can safely identify 1 ⊗ X and\nX ⊗ 1 with X using the unit isomorphisms, and assume that the unit\nisomorphism are the identities (which we will usually do from now on).3\nIn a sense, all this means that in constructions with monoidal cat\negories, unit objects and isomorphisms always \"go for the ride\", and\none need not worry about them especially seriously. For this reason,\nbelow we will typically take less care dealing with them than we have\ndone in this subsection.\nProposition 1.2.7. ([SR, 1.3.3.1]) The monoid End(1) of endomor\nphisms of the unit object of a monoidal category is commutative.\nProof. The unit isomorphism ι : 1 ⊗ 1\n∼1 induces the isomorphism\n-→\nψ : End(1⊗1)\n∼End(1). It is easy to see that ψ(a⊗1) = ψ(1⊗a) = a\n-→\nfor any a ∈ End(1). Therefore,\n(1.2.9)\nab = ψ((a ⊗ 1)(1 ⊗ b)) = ψ((1 ⊗ b)(a ⊗ 1)) = ba,\nfor any a, b ∈ End(1).\n\n1.3. First examples of monoidal categories. Monoidal categories\nare ubiquitous. You will see one whichever way you look. Here are\nsome examples.\nExample 1.3.1. The category Sets of sets is a monoidal category,\nwhere the tensor product is the Cartesian product and the unit object\nis a one element set; the structure morphisms a, ι, l, r are obvious. The\nsame holds for the subcategory of finite sets, which will be denoted\nby Sets 4 . This example can be widely generalized: one can take the\ncategory of sets with some structure, such as groups, topological spaces,\netc.\nExample 1.3.2. Any additive category is monoidal, with ⊗ being the\ndirect sum functor ⊕, and 1 being the zero object.\nThe remaining examples will be especially important below.\n3We will return to this issue later when we discuss MacLane's coherence theorem.\n4Here and below, the absence of a finiteness condition condition is indicated by\nthe boldface font, while its presence is indicated by the Roman font.\n\nExample 1.3.3. Let k be any field. The category k - Vec of all\nk-vector spaces is a monoidal category, where ⊗ = ⊗k, 1 = k, and the\nmorphisms a, ι, l, r are the obvious ones. The same is true about the\ncategory of finite dimensional vector spaces over k, denoted by k - Vec.\nWe will often drop k from the notation when no confusion is possible.\nMore generally, if R is a commutative unital ring, then replacing k\nby R we can define monoidal categories R - mod of R-modules and\nR - mod of R-modules of finite type.\nExample 1.3.4. Let G be a group. The category Repk(G) of all\nrepresentations of G over k is a monoidal category, with ⊗ being the\ntensor product of representations: if for a representation V one denotes\nby ρV the corresponding map G\nGL(V ), then\n→\nρV ⊗W (g) := ρV (g) ⊗ ρW (g).\nThe unit object in this category is the trivial representation 1 = k. A\nsimilar statement holds for the category Repk(G) of finite dimensional\nrepresentations of G. Again, we will drop the subscript k when no\nconfusion is possible.\nExample 1.3.5. Let G be an affine (pro)algebraic group over k. The\ncategories Rep(G) of all algebraic representations of G over k is a\nmonoidal category (similarly to Example 1.3.4).\nSimilarly, if g is a Lie algebra over k, then the category of its repre\nsentations Rep(g) and the category of its finite dimensional represen\ntations Rep(g) are monoidal categories: the tensor product is defined\nby\nρV ⊗W (a) = ρV (a) ⊗ IdW + IdV ⊗ ρW (a)\n(where ρY : g\ngl(Y ) is the homomorphism associated to a represen\n→\ntation Y of g), and 1 is the 1-dimensional representation with the zero\naction of g.\nExample 1.3.6. Let G be a monoid (which we will usually take to\nbe a group), and let A be an abelian group (with operation written\nmultiplicatively). Let CG = CG(A) be the category whose objects δg\nare labeled by elements of G (so there is only one object in each iso\nmorphism class), Hom(δg1 , δg2 ) = ∅ if g1 =6\ng2, and Hom(δg, δg) = A,\nwith the functor ⊗ defined by δg ⊗ δh = δgh, and the tensor tensor\nproduct of morphisms defined by a ⊗ b = ab. Then CG is a monoidal\ncategory with the associativity isomorphism being the identity, and 1\nbeing the unit element of G. This shows that in a monoidal category,\nX ⊗ Y need not be isomorphic to Y ⊗ X (indeed, it suffices to take a\nnon-commutative monoid G).\n\nThis example has a \"linear\" version. Namely, let k be a field, and\nk - VecG denote the category of G-graded vector spaces over k, i.e.\nvector spaces V with a decomposition V = ⊕g∈GVg. Morphisms in this\ncategory are linear operators which preserve the grading. Define the\ntensor product on this category by the formula\n(V ⊗ W )g = ⊕x,y∈G:xy=gVx ⊗ Wy,\nand the unit object 1 by 11 = k and 1g = 0 for g = 1. Then,\ndefining a, ι in an obvious way, we equip k - VecG with the structure\nof a monoidal category. Similarly one defines the monoidal category\nk - VecG of finite dimensional G-graded k-vector spaces.\nIn the category k - VecG, we have pairwise non-isomorphic objects\nδg, g ∈ G, defined by the formula (δg)x = k if x = g and (δg)x =\n0 otherwise. For these objects, we have δg\n= δgh. Thus the\n⊗ δh ∼\ncategory CG(k×) is a (non-full) monoidal subcategory of k -VecG. This\nsubcategory can be viewed as a \"basis\" of VecG (and VecG as \"the linear\nspan\" of CG), as any object of VecG is isomorphic to a direct sum of\nobjects δg with nonnegative integer multiplicities.\nWhen no confusion is possible, we will denote the categories k-VecG,\nk - VecG simply by VecG, VecG.\nExample 1.3.7. This is really a generalization of Example 1.3.6, which\nshows that the associativity isomorphism is not always \"the obvious\none\".\nLet G be a group, A an abelian group, and ω be a 3-cocycle of G\nwith values in A. This means that ω : G × G × G\nA is a function\n→\nsatisfying the equation\n(1.3.1)\nω(g1g2, g3, g4)ω(g1, g2, g3g4) = ω(g1, g2, g3)ω(g1, g2g3, g4)ω(g2, g3, g4),\nfor all g1, g2, g3, g4 ∈ G.\nLet us define the monoidal category Cω = Cω (A) as follows. As a\nG\nG\ncategory, it is the same as the category CG defined above. The bifunctor\n⊗ and the unit object (1, ι) in this category is also the same as those\nin CG. The only difference is in the new associativity isomorphism aω ,\nwhich is not \"the obvious one\" (i.e., the identity) like in CG, but rather\nis defined by the formula\n(1.3.2)\na ω\nδg ,δh,δm = ω(g, h, m) : (δg ⊗ δh) ⊗ δm\nδg ⊗ (δh ⊗ δm),\n→\nwhere g, h, m ∈ G.\nThe fact that Cω with these structures is indeed a monoidal category\nG\nfollows from the properties of ω. Namely, the pentagon axiom (1.1.2)\nfollows from equation (1.3.1), and the unit axiom is obvious.\n\nSimilarly, for a field k, one can define the category (k-)Vecω , which\nG\ndiffers from VecG just by the associativity isomorphism. This is done\nby extending the associativity isomorphism of Cω by additivity to ar-\nG\nbitrary direct sums of objects δg. This category contains a monoidal\nsubcategory Vecω of finite dimensional G-graded vector spaces with\nG\nassociativity defined by ω.\nRemark 1.3.8. It is straightforward to verify that the unit morphisms\nl, r in Vecω are given on 1-dimensional spaces by the formulas\nG\nlδg = ω(1, 1, g)-1Idg, rδg = ω(g, 1, 1)Idg,\nand the triangle axiom says that ω(g, 1, h) = ω(g, 1, 1)ω(1, 1, h). Thus,\nwe have lX = rX = Id if and only if\n(1.3.3)\nω(g, 1, 1) = ω(1, 1, g),\nfor any g ∈ G or, equivalently,\n(1.3.4)\nω(g, 1, h) = 1, g, h ∈ G.\nA cocycle satisfying this condition is said to be normalized.\nExample 1.3.9. Let C be a category. Then the category End(C) of\nall functors from C to itself is a monoidal category, where ⊗ is given\nby composition of functors. The associativity isomorphism in this cat\negory is the identity. The unit object is the identity functor, and the\nstructure morphisms are obvious. If C is an abelian category, the same\nis true about the categories of additive, left exact, right exact, and\nexact endofunctors of C.\nExample 1.3.10. Let A be an associative ring with unit. Then the\ncategory A - bimod of bimodules over A is a monoidal category, with\ntensor product ⊗ = ⊗A, over A. The unit object in this category is\nthe ring A itself (regarded as an A-bimodule).\nIf A is commutative, this category has a full monoidal subcategory\nA - mod, consisting of A-modules, regarded as bimodules in which\nthe left and right actions of A coincide. More generally, if X is a\nscheme, one can define the monoidal category QCoh(X) of quasico\nherent sheaves on X; if X is affine and A = OX , then QCoh(X) =\nA - mod.\nSimilarly, if A is a finite dimensional algebra, we can define the\nmonoidal category A-bimod of finite dimensional A-bimodules. Other\nsimilar examples which often arise in geometry are the category Coh(X)\nof coherent sheaves on a scheme X, its subcategory VB(X) of vector\nbundles (i.e., locally free coherent sheaves) on X, and the category\nLoc(X) of locally constant sheaves of finite dimensional k-vector spaces\n\n(also called local systems) on any topological space X. All of these are\nmonoidal categories in a natural way.\nExample 1.3.11. The category of tangles.\nLet Sm,n be the disjoint union of m circles R/Z and n intervals\n[0, 1]. A tangle is a piecewise smooth embedding f : Sm,n → R2 × [0, 1]\nsuch that the boundary maps to the boundary and the interior to the\ninterior. We will abuse the terminology by also using the term \"tangle\"\nfor the image of f.\nLet x, y, z be the Cartesian coordinates on R2 × [0, 1]. Any tangle\nhas inputs (points of the image of f with z = 0) and outputs (points of\nthe image of f with z = 1). For any integers p, q ≥ 0, let Tep,q be the set\nof all tangles which have p inputs and q outputs, all having a vanishing\ny-coordinate. Let Tp,q be the set of isotopy classes of elements of Tep,q;\nthus, during an isotopy, the inputs and outputs are allowed to move\n(preserving the condition y = 0), but cannot meet each other. We can\ndefine a canonical composition map Tp,q × Tq,r → Tp,r, induced by the\nconcatenation of tangles. Namely, if s ∈ Tp,q and t ∈ Tq,r, we pick rep\nresentatives se ∈ Tep,q, et ∈ Teq,r such that the inputs of et coincide with the\noutputs of se, concatenate them, perform an appropriate reparametriza\ntion, and rescale z\nz/2. The obtained tangle represents the desired\n→\ncomposition ts.\nWe will now define a monoidal category T called the category of\ntangles (see [K, T, BaKi] for more details). The objects of this cat\negory are nonnegative integers, and the morphisms are defined by\nHomT (p, q) = Tp,q, with composition as above. The identity morphisms\nare the elements idp ∈ Tp,p represented by p vertical intervals and no\ncircles (in particular, if p = 0, the identity morphism idp is the empty\ntangle).\nNow let us define the monoidal structure on the category T . The\ntensor product of objects is defined by m⊗n = m+n. However, we also\nneed to define the tensor product of morphisms. This tensor product\nis induced by union of tangles. Namely, if t1 ∈ Tp1,q1 and t2 ∈ Tp2,q2 , we\npick representatives te1 ∈ Tep1,q1 , te2 ∈ Tep2,q2 in such a way that any point\nof te1 is to the left of any point of te2 (i.e., has a smaller x-coordinate).\nThen t1 ⊗ t2 is represented by the tangle te1 ∪ te2.\nWe leave it to the reader to check the following:\n1. The product t1 ⊗ t2 is well defined, and its definition makes ⊗ a\nbifunctor.\n2. There is an obvious associativity isomorphism for ⊗, which turns\nT into a monoidal category (with unit object being the empty tangle).\n\n1.4. Monoidal functors, equivalence of monoidal categories.\nAs we have explained, monoidal categories are a categorification of\nmonoids. Now we pass to categorification of morphisms between monoids,\nnamely monoidal functors.\nDefinition 1.4.1. Let (C, ⊗, 1, a, ι) and (C0, ⊗0, 10, a0, ι0) be two monoidal\ncategories. A monoidal functor from\nis a pair (F, J) where\nto\nC\nC\n⏐⏐y\nF : C →C0 is a functor, and J = {JX,Y : F (X) ⊗0 F (Y )\n∼F (X ⊗\n-→\nY )|X, Y ∈ C} is a natural isomorphism, such that F (1) is isomorphic\nto 10. and the diagram\n(1.4.1)\na0\nF (X),F (Y ),F (Z)\n(F (X) ⊗0 F (Y )) ⊗0 F (Z) ---------→ F (X) ⊗0 (F (Y ) ⊗0 F (Z))\n⏐⏐y\nJX,Y ⊗0IdF (Z)\nIdF (X)⊗0JY,Z\nF (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗0 F (Z)\nJX⊗Y,Z\n⏐⏐y\n⏐⏐y\nF (X) ⊗0 F (Y ⊗ Z)\nJX,Y ⊗Z\nF (aX,Y,Z )\nF ((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z)\n-----→\nF (X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z))\nx⏐⏐\n→\n⏐⏐y\nis commutative for all X, Y, Z ∈C (\"the monoidal structure axiom\").\nA monoidal functor F is said to be an equivalence of monoidal cate\ngories if it is an equivalence of ordinary categories.\nRemark 1.4.2. It is important to stress that, as seen from this defini\ntion, a monoidal functor is not just a functor between monoidal cate\ngories, but a functor with an additional structure (the isomorphism J)\nsatisfying a certain equation (the monoidal structure axiom). As we\nwill see later, this equation may have more than one solution, so the\nsame functor can be equipped with different monoidal structures.\nIt turns out that if F is a monoidal functor, then there is a canon\nical isomorphism φ : 10\nF (1). This isomorphism is defined by the\ncommutative diagram\nl0\n10 ⊗0 F (1)\nF (1)\nF (1)\n---→\n(1.4.2)\nφ⊗0IdF (X)\nF (l1 )\nJ1,1\n---→ F (1 ⊗ 1)\nF (1) ⊗0 F (1)\nwhere l, r, l0, r0 are the unit isomorphisms for C, C0 defined in Subsection\n1.2.\n\nProposition 1.4.3. For any monoidal functor (F, J) : C →C0, the\ndiagrams\nl0\n10 ⊗0 F (X)\nF (X)\nF (X)\nx⏐⏐\n⏐⏐y\n---→\n(1.4.3)\nφ⊗0IdF (X)\nF (1) ⊗0 F (X)\nF (lX )\nJ1,X\n---→ F (1 ⊗ X)\nand\nr0\nF (X) ⊗0 10\nF (X)\n⏐⏐y\n---→\n(1.4.4)\nIdF (X)⊗0φ\nx⏐⏐\nF (X)\nF (rX )\nJX,1\n---→ F (X ⊗ 1)\nF (X) ⊗0 F (1)\nare commutative for all X ∈C.\nExercise 1.4.4. Prove Proposition 1.4.3.\nProposition 1.4.3 implies that a monoidal functor can be equivalently\ndefined as follows.\nDefinition 1.4.5. A monoidal functor C →C0 is a triple (F, J, φ) which\nsatisfies the monoidal structure axiom and Proposition 1.4.3.\nThis is a more traditional definition of a monoidal functor.\nRemark 1.4.6. It can be seen from the above that for any monoidal\nfunctor (F, J) one can safely identify 10 with F (1) using the isomor\nphism φ, and assume that F (1) = 10 and φ = Id (similarly to how we\nhave identified 1 ⊗ X and X ⊗ 1 with X and assumed that lX = rX =\nIdX ). We will usually do so from now on. Proposition 1.4.3 implies\nthat with these conventions, one has\n(1.4.5)\nJ1,X = JX,1 = IdX .\nRemark 1.4.7. It is clear that the composition of monoidal functors is\na monoidal functor. Also, the identity functor has a natural structure\nof a monoidal functor.\n1.5. Morphisms of monoidal functors. Monoidal functors between\ntwo monoidal categories themselves form a category. Namely, one has\nthe following notion of a morphism (or natural transformation) between\ntwo monoidal functors.\n\nDefinition 1.5.1. Let (C, ⊗, 1, a, ι) and (C0, ⊗0, 10, a0, ι0) be two monoidal\ncategories, and (F 1, J1), (F 2, J2) two monoidal functors from C to\nC0. A morphism (or a natural transformation) of monoidal functors\nη : (F 1, J1)\n(F 2, J2) is a natural transformation η : F 1\nF 2 such\n→\n→\nthat η1 is an isomorphism, and the diagram\nJ1\nX,Y\nF 1(X) ⊗0 F 1(Y ) ---→ F 1(X ⊗ Y )\n⏐⏐y\n⏐⏐y\n(1.5.1)\nηX ⊗0ηY\nηX⊗Y\nJ2\nX,Y\nF 2(X) ⊗0 F 2(Y ) ---→ F 2(X ⊗ Y )\nis commutative for all X, Y ∈C.\nRemark 1.5.2. It is easy to show that η1 * φ1 = φ2 , so if one makes\nthe convention that φi = Id, one has η1 = Id.\nRemark 1.5.3. It is easy to show that if F : C →C0 is an equivalence\nof monoidal categories, then there exists a monoidal equivalence F -1 :\nC0 →C such that the functors F * F -1 and F -1 * F are isomorphic\nto the identity functor as monoidal functors. Thus, for any monoidal\ncategory C, the monoidal auto-equivalences of C up to isomorphism\nform a group with respect to composition.\n1.6. Examples of monoidal functors. Let us now give some exam\nples of monoidal functors and natural transformations.\nExample 1.6.1. An important class of examples of monoidal functors\nis forgetful functors (e.g. functors of \"forgetting the structure\", from\nthe categories of groups, topological spaces, etc., to the category of\nsets). Such functors have an obvious monoidal structure. An example\nimportant in these notes is the forgetful functor RepG\nVec from\n→\nthe representation category of a group to the category of vector spaces.\nMore generally, if H ⊂ G is a subgroup, then we have a forgetful\n(or restriction) functor RepG\nRepH . Still more generally, if f :\n→\nH\nG is a group homomorphism, then we have the pullback functor\n→\nf ∗ : RepG → RepH . All these functors are monoidal.\nExample 1.6.2. Let f : H\nG be a homomorphism of groups. Then\n→\nany H-graded vector space is naturally G-graded (by pushforward of\ngrading). Thus we have a natural monoidal functor f∗ : VecH\nVecG.\n→\nIf G is the trivial group, then f is just the forgetful functor VecH\n∗\n→\nVec.\nExample 1.6.3. Let A be a k-algebra with unit, and C = A - mod\nbe the category of left A-modules. Then we have a functor F : A -\n\nbimod\nEnd(C) given by F (M) = M⊗A. This functor is naturally\n→\nmonoidal. A similar functor F : A - bimod\nEnd(C). can be defined\n→\nif A is a finite dimensional k-algebra, and C = A - mod is the category\nof finite dimensional left A-modules.\nProposition 1.6.4. The functor F : A-bimod\nEnd(C) takes values\n→\nin the full monoidal subcategory Endre(C) of right exact endofunctors of\nC, and defines an equivalence between monoidal categories A - bimod\nand Endre(C)\nProof. The first statement is clear, since the tensor product functor\nis right exact. To prove the second statement, let us construct the\nquasi-inverse functor F -1 . Let G ∈ Endre(C). Define F -1(G) by the\nformula F -1(G) = G(A); this is clearly an A-bimodule, since it is a\nleft A-module with a commuting action EndA(A) = Aop (the opposite\nalgebra). We leave it to the reader to check that the functor F -1 is\nindeed quasi-inverse to F .\n\nRemark 1.6.5. A similar statement is valid without the finite dimen\nsionality assumption, if one adds the condition that the right exact\nfunctors must commute with inductive limits.\nExample 1.6.6. Let S be a monoid, and C = VecS , and IdC the identity\nfunctor of C. It is easy to see that morphisms η : IdC → IdC correspond\nto homomorphisms of monoids: η : S\nk (where k is equipped with\n→\nthe multiplication operation). In particular, η(s) may be 0 for some s,\nso η does not have to be an isomorphism.\nω\n1.7. Monoidal functors between categories CG. Let G1, G2 be\ngroups, A an abelian group, and ωi ∈ Z3(Gi, A), i = 1, 2 be 3-cocycles.\nωi\nLet Ci = CGi , i = 1, 2 (see Example 1.3.7).\nAny monoidal functor F : C1 →C2 defines, by restriction to simple\nobjects, a group homomorphism f : G1 → G2. Using the axiom (1.4.1)\nof a monoidal functor we see that a monoidal structure on F is given\nby\n(1.7.1)\nJg,h = μ(g, h)Idδf (gh) : F (δg) ⊗ F (δh)\n∼F (δgh), g, h ∈ G1,\n-→\nwhere μ : G1 × G1 → A is a function such that\nω1(g, h, l)μ(gh, l)μ(g, h) = μ(g, hl)μ(h, l)ω2(f(g), f(h), f(l)),\nfor all g, h, l ∈ G1. That is,\n(1.7.2)\nf ∗ω2 = ω1∂2(μ),\ni.e., ω1 and f ∗ω2 are cohomologous in Z3(G1, A).\n\nConversely, given a group homomorphism f : G1\nG2, a function\n→\nμ : G1 × G1\nA satisfying (1.7.2) gives rise to a monoidal functor\n→\nF : C1 →C2 defined by F (δg) = δf(g) with the monoidal structure\ngiven by formula (1.7.1). This functor is an equivalence if and only if\nf is an isomorphism.\nTo summarize, monoidal functors Cω1 →Cω2 correspond to pairs\nG1\nG2\n(f, μ), where f : G1\nG2 is a group homomorphism such that ω1\n→\nand f ∗ω2 are cohomologous, and μ is a function satisfying (1.7.2) (such\nfunctions are in a (non-canonical) bijection with A-valued 2-cocycles\non G1). Let Ff,μ denote the corresponding functor.\nLet us determine natural monoidal transformations between Ff,μ and\nFf0,μ0 . Clearly, such a transformation exists if and only if f = f 0, is\nalways an isomorphism, and is determined by a collection of morphisms\nηg : δf (g) → δf(g) (i.e., ηg ∈ A), satisfying the equation\n(1.7.3)\nμ0(g, h)(ηg ⊗ ηh) = ηghμ(g, h)\nfor all g, h ∈ G1, i.e.,\n(1.7.4)\nμ0 = μ∂1(η).\nConversely, every function η : G1\nA satisfying (1.7.4) gives rise to\n→\na morphism of monoidal functors η : Ff,μ → Ff,μ0 defined as above.\nThus, functors Ff,μ and Ff0,μ0 are isomorphic as monoidal functors if\nand only if f = f 0 and μ is cohomologous to μ0.\nThus, we have obtained the following proposition.\nProposition 1.7.1. (i) The monoidal isomorphisms Ff,μ → Ff,μ0 of\nω1\nω2\nmonoidal functors Ff,μi : CG1 →CG2 form a torsor over the group\nH1(G1, k×) = Hom(G1, k×) of characters of G1;\n(ii) Given f, the set of μ parametrizing isomorphism classes of Ff,μ\nis a torsor over H2(G1, k×);\n(iii) The structures of a monoidal category on (CG, ⊗) are parametrized\nby H3(G, k×)/Out(G), where Out(G) is the group of outer automor\nphisms of G. 5\nRemark 1.7.2. The same results, including Proposition 1.7.1, are\nvalid if we replace the categories Cω by their \"linear spans\" Vecω , and\nG\nG\nrequire that the monoidal functors we consider are additive. To see\nthis, it is enough to note that by definition, for any morphism η of\nmonoidal functors, η1 6= 0, so equation (1.7.3) (with h = g-1) implies\n5Recall that the group Inn(G) of inner automorphisms of a group G acts trivially\non H∗(G, A) (for any coefficient group A), and thus the action of the group Aut(G)\non H∗(G, A) factors through Out(G).\n\nthat all ηg must be nonzero. Thus, if a morphism η : Ff,μ\nFf0,μ0\n→\nexists, then it is an isomorphism, and we must have f = f 0.\nRemark 1.7.3. The above discussion implies that in the definition\nof the categories Cω and Vecω it may be assumed without loss of\nG\nG,\ngenerality that the cocycle ω is normalized, i.e., ω(g, 1, h) = 1, and\nthus lδg = rδg = Id (which is convenient in computations). Indeed, we\nclaim that any 3-cocycle ω is cohomologous to a normalized one. To\nsee this, it is enough to alter ω by dividing it by ∂2μ, where μ is any\n2-cochain such that μ(g, 1) = ω(g, 1, 1), and μ(1, h) = ω(1, 1, h)-1 .\nExample 1.7.4. Let G = Z/nZ where n > 1 is an integer, and k = C.\nConsider the cohomology of Z/nZ.\nSince Hi(Z/nZ, C) = 0 for all i > 0, writing the long exact sequence\nof cohomology for the short exact sequence of coefficient groups\n0 -→ Z -→ C -→ C× = C/Z -→ 0,\nwe obtain a natural isomorphism Hi(Z/nZ, C×) ∼= Hi+1(Z/nZ, Z).\nIt is well known [Br] that the graded ring H∗(Z/nZ, Z) is (Z/nZ)[x]\nwhere x is a generator in degree 2. Moreover, as a module over Aut(Z/nZ) =\n(Z/nZ)×, we have H2(Z/nZ, Z) ∼\nThere\n= H1(Z/nZ, C×) = (Z/nZ)∨.\nfore, using the graded ring structure, we find that H2m(Z/nZ, Z) ∼=\nH2m-1(Z/nZ, C×) = ((Z/nZ)∨)⊗m as an Aut(Z/nZ)-module. In par\nticular, H3(Z/nZ, C×) = ((Z/nZ)∨)⊗2 .\nThis consideration shows that if n = 2 then the categorification\nproblem has 2 solutions (the cases of trivial and non-trivial cocycle),\nwhile if n is a prime greater than 2 then there are 3 solutions: the trivial\ncocycle, and two non-trivial cocycles corresponding (non-canonically)\nto quadratic residues and non-residues mod n.\nLet us give an explicit formula for the 3-cocycles on Z/nZ. Modulo\ncoboundaries, these cocycles are given by\nsi(j+k-(j+k)0)\n(1.7.5)\nφ(i, j, k) = ε\nn\n,\nwhere ε is a primitive nth root of unity, s ∈ Z/nZ, and for an integer\nm we denote by m0 the remainder of division of m by n.\nExercise 1.7.5. Show that when s runs over Z/nZ this formula defines\ncocycles representing all cohomology classes in H3(Z/nZ, C×).\n1.8. MacLane's strictness theorem. As we have seen above, it is\nmuch simpler to work with monoidal categories in which the associa\ntivity and unit constrains are the identity maps.\nDefinition 1.8.1. A monoidal category C is strict if for all objects\nX, Y, Z in C one has equalities (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z = X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z) and\n\nX ⊗ 1 = X = 1 ⊗ X, and the associativity and unit constraints are the\nidentity maps.\nExample 1.8.2. The category End(C) endofunctors of a category C is\nstrict.\nExample 1.8.3. Let Sets be the category whose objects are nonnega\ntive integers, and Hom(m, n) is the set of maps from {0, ..., m - 1} to\n{0, ..., n - 1}. Define the tensor product functor on objects by m⊗n =\nmn, and for f1 : m1 → n1, f2 : m2 → n2, define f1 ⊗ f2 : m1m2 → n1n2\nby\n(f1 ⊗ f2)(m2x + y) = n2f1(x) + f2(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ m1 - 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ m2 - 1.\nThen Sets is a strict monoidal category. Moreover, we have a natural\ninclusion Sets ,\nSets, which is obviously a monoidal equivalence.\n→\nExample 1.8.4. This is really a linear version of the previous example.\nLet k-Vec be the category whose objects are nonnegative integers, and\nHom(m, n) is the set of matrices with m columns and n rows over some\nfield k (and the composition of morphisms is the product of matrices).\nDefine the tensor product functor on objects by m ⊗ n = mn, and for\nf1 : m1\nn1, f2 : m2\nn2, define f1 ⊗ f2 : m1m2\nn1n2 to be the\n→\n→\n→\nKronecker product of f1 and f2. Then k - Vec is a strict monoidal\ncategory. Moreover, we have a natural inclusion k - Vec ,\nk - Vec,\n→\nwhich is obviously a monoidal equivalence.\nSimilarly, for any group G one can define a strict monoidal category\nk - VecG, whose objects are Z+-valued functions on G with finitely\nmany nonzero values, and which is monoidally equivalent to k - VecG.\nWe leave this definition to the reader.\nOn the other hand, some of the most important monoidal categories,\nsuch as Sets, Vec, VecG, Sets, Vec, VecG, should be regarded as non-\nstrict (at least if one defines them in the usual way). It is even more\nindisputable that the categories Vecω , Vecω for cohomologically non-\nG\nG\ntrivial ω are not strict.\nHowever, the following remarkable theorem of MacLane implies that\nin practice, one may always assume that a monoidal category is strict.\nTheorem 1.8.5. Any monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a\nstrict monoidal category.\nProof. The proof presented below was given in [JS]. We will establish\nan equivalence between C and the monoidal category of right C-module\nendofunctors of C, which we will discuss in more detail later. The non-\ncategorical algebraic counterpart of this result is of course the fact that\n\nu\n) )\n\n/ /\n\n/ /\nevery monoid M is isomorphic to the monoid consisting of maps from\nM to itself commuting with the right multiplication.\nFor a monoidal category C, let C0 be the monoidal category defined\nas follows. The objects of C are pairs (F, c) where F : C →C is a\nfunctor and\ncX,Y : F (X) ⊗ Y\n∼F (X ⊗ Y )\n-→\nis a functorial isomorphism, such that the following diagram is com\nmutative for all objects X, Y, Z in C:\n(1.8.1)\nkkkkkkkkkkk\n(\nk\nF\nkk (X) ⊗ Y ) ⊗SSZ\nSSSSSSSSSSSSS\ncX,Y ⊗IdZ\naF (X),Y,Z\nF (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z\nF (X) ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)\ncX⊗Y ,Z\ncX,Y ⊗Z\nF ((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z)\n� F (X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)).\nF (aX,Y,Z )\nA morphism θ : (F 1, c1) → (F 2, c2) in C0 is a natural transformation\nθ : F 1\nF 2 such that the following square commutes for all objects\n→\nX, Y in C:\nc\n(1.8.2)\nF 1(X) ⊗ Y\nX,Y F 1(X ⊗ Y )\nθX ⊗IdY\nθX⊗Y\nF2(X) ⊗ Y\nF 2(X ⊗ Y )\ncX,Y\nComposition of morphisms is the vertical composition of natural trans\nformations.\nThe tensor product of objects is given by (F 1, c1) ⊗\n(F 2, c2) = (F 1F 2, c) where c is given by a composition\ncF2(X),Y\nF1(cX,Y )\n(1.8.3) F 1F 2(X) ⊗ Y ----→ F 1(F 2(X) ⊗ Y ) - ---→ F 1F 2(X ⊗ Y )\nfor all X, Y ∈C, and the tensor product of morphisms is the horizontal\ncomposition of natural transformations. Thus C0 is a strict monoidal\ncategory (the unit object is the identity functor).\nConsider now the functor of left multiplication L : C →C0 given by\nL(X) = (X ⊗-, aX,-, ), L(f) = f ⊗-.\n-\nNote that the diagram (1.8.1) for L(X) is nothing but the pentagon\ndiagram (1.1.2).\nWe claim that this functor L is a monoidal equivalence.\n\nFirst of all, L essentially surjective: it is easy to check that for any\n(F, c) ∈C0, (F, c) is isomorphic to L(F (1)).\nLet us now show that L is fully faithful.

Thus L is faithful.\nFinally, we define a monoidal functor structure JX,Y : L(X) L(Y )\n∼\n*\n-→\nL(X ⊗ Y ) on L by\nJX,Y = a-1\n- : X ⊗ (Y ⊗-), ((IdX ⊗ aY,\n-) * aX,Y ⊗-,-)\nX,Y,\n-,\n∼\n).\n-→ ((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗-, aX⊗Y,-,-\nThe diagram (1.8.2) for the latter natural isomorphism is just the pen\ntagon diagram in C. For the functor L the hexagon diagram (1.4.1)\nin the definition of a monoidal functor also reduces to the pentagon\ndiagram in C. The theorem is proved.\n\nRemark 1.8.6. The nontrivial nature of MacLane's strictness theo\nrem is demonstrated by the following instructive example, which shows\nthat even though a monoidal category is always equivalent to a strict\ncategory, it need not be isomorphic to one. (By definition, an iso\nmorphism of monoidal categories is a monoidal equivalence which is an\nisomorphism of categories).\nω\nNamely, let C be the category CG. If ω is cohomologically nontrivial,\nthis category is clearly not isomorphic to a strict one. However, by\nMaclane's strictness theorem, it is equivalent to a strict category C0.\nIn fact, in this example a strict category C0 monoidally equivalent\nto C can be constructed quite explicitly, as follows. Let Ge be another\n\ngroup with a surjective homomorphism f : Ge\nG such that the 3\ncocycle f ∗ω is cohomologically trivial. Such Ge\n→\nalways exists, e.g., a\nfree group (recall that the cohomology of a free group in degrees higher\nthan 1 is trivial, see [Br]). Let C0 be the category whose objects δg\nare labeled by elements of Ge, Hom(δg, δh) = A if g, h have the same\nimage in G, and Hom(δg, δh) = ∅ otherwise. This category has an\nobvious tensor product, and a monoidal structure defined by the 3\ncocycle f ∗ω. We have an obvious monoidal functor F : C0 →C defined\nby the homomorphism Ge\nG, and it is an equivalence, even though\n→\nnot an isomorphism. However, since the cocycle f ∗ω is cohomologically\ntrivial, the category C0 is isomorphic to the same category with the\ntrivial associativity isomorphism, which is strict.\nRemark 1.8.7. 6 A category is called skeletal if it has only one object\nin each isomorphism class. The axiom of choice implies that any cate\ngory is equivalent to a skeletal one. Also, by MacLane's theorem, any\nmonoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict one. However,\nRemark 1.8.6 shows that a monoidal category need not be monoidally\nequivalent to a category which is skeletal and strict at the same time.\nIndeed, as we have seen, to make a monoidal category strict, it may\nbe necessary to add new objects to it (which are isomorphic, but not\nequal to already existing ones). In fact, the desire to avoid adding\nsuch objects is the reason why we sometimes use nontrivial associa\ntivity isomorphisms, even though MacLane's strictness theorem tells\nus we don't have to. This also makes precise the sense in which the\ncategories Sets, Vec, VecG, are \"more strict\" than the category Vecω\nG\nfor cohomologically nontrivial ω. Namely, the first three categories\nare monoidally equivalent to strict skeletal categories Sets, Vec, VecG,\nwhile the category Vecω is not monoidally equivalent to a strict skeletal\nG\ncategory.\nExercise 1.8.8. Show that any monoidal category C is monoidally\nequivalent to a skeletal monoidal category C. Moreover, C can be chosen\nin such a way that lX , rX = IdX for all objects X ∈C.\nHint. Without loss of generality one can assume that 1 ⊗ X =\nX ⊗ 1 = X and lX , rX = IdX for all objects X ∈C. Now in every\nisomorphism class i of objects of C fix a representative Xi, so that X1 =\n1, and for any two classes i, j fix an isomorphism μij : Xi ⊗ Xj → Xi j ,\n·\nso that μi1 = μ1i = IdXi . Let C be the full subcategory of C consisting\nof the objects Xi, with tensor product defined by Xi⊗Xj = Xi j , and\n·\n6This remark is borrowed from the paper [Kup2].\n\nwith all the structure transported using the isomorphisms μij . Then C\nis the required skeletal category, monoidally equivalent to C.\n\n1.9. The MacLane coherence theorem. In a monoidal category,\none can form n-fold tensor products of any ordered sequence of objects\nX1, ..., Xn. Namely, such a product can be attached to any parenthe\nsizing of the expression X1 ⊗...⊗Xn, and such products are, in general,\ndistinct objects of C.\nHowever, for n = 3, the associativity isomorphism gives a canonical\nidentification of the two possible parenthesizings, (X1 ⊗ X2) ⊗ X3 and\nX1 ⊗ (X2 ⊗ X3). An easy combinatorial argument then shows that one\ncan identify any two parenthesized products of X1, ..., Xn, n ≥ 3, using\na chain of associativity isomorphisms.\nWe would like to say that for this reason we can completely ignore\nparentheses in computations in any monoidal category, identifying all\npossible parenthesized products with each other. But this runs into the\nfollowing problem: for n ≥ 4 there may be two or more different chains\nof associativity isomorphisms connecting two different parenthesizings,\nand a priori it is not clear that they provide the same identification.\nLuckily, for n = 4, this is settled by the pentagon axiom, which\nstates exactly that the two possible identifications are the same. But\nwhat about n > 4?\nThis problem is solved by the following theorem of MacLane, which\nis the first important result in the theory of monoidal categories.\nTheorem 1.9.1. (MacLane's Coherence Theorem) [ML] Let X1, . . . , Xn ∈\nC. Let P1, P2 be any two parenthesized products of X1, ..., Xn (in this\norder) with arbitrary insertions of unit objects 1. Let f, g : P1\nP2\n→\nbe two isomorphisms, obtained by composing associativity and unit\nisomorphisms and their inverses possibly tensored with identity mor\nphisms. Then f = g.\nProof. We derive this theorem as a corollary of the MacLane's strictness\nTheorem 1.8.5. Let L : C →C0 be a monoidal equivalence between C\nand a strict monoidal category C0. Consider a diagram in C representing\nf and g and apply L to it. Over each arrow of the resulting diagram\nrepresenting an associativity isomorphism, let us build a rectangle as\nin (1.4.1), and do similarly for the unit morphisms. This way we obtain\na prism one of whose faces consists of identity maps (associativity and\nunit isomorphisms in C0) and whose sides are commutative. Hence, the\nother face is commutative as well, i.e., f = g.\n\nAs we mentioned, this implies that any two parenthesized products\nof X1, ..., Xn with insertions of unit objects are indeed canonically iso\nmorphic, and thus one can safely identify all of them with each other\n\nand ignore bracketings in calculations in a monoidal category. We will\ndo so from now on, unless confusion is possible.\n1.10. Rigid monoidal categories. Let (C, ⊗, 1, a, ι) be a monoidal\ncategory, and let X be an object of C. In what follows, we suppress\nthe unit morphisms l, r.\nDefinition 1.10.1. A right dual of an object X in C is an object X∗\nin C equipped with morphisms evX : X∗ ⊗ X → 1 and coevX : 1 →\nX ⊗ X∗, called the evaluation and coevaluation morphisms, such that\nthe compositions\n(1.10.1)\nX\ncoevX ⊗IdX\naX,X∗,X X ⊗ (X∗ ⊗ X)\nIdX ⊗evX\n------→ (X ⊗ X∗) ⊗ X ----→\n-----→ X,\n(1.10.2)\na-1\nX∗ IdX∗ ⊗coevX\nX∗,X,X∗\nevX ⊗IdX∗ X∗\n-------→ X∗ ⊗ (X ⊗ X∗) -----→ (X∗ ⊗ X) ⊗ X∗ - ----→\nare the identity morphisms.\nDefinition 1.10.2. A left dual of an object X in C is an object ∗X in C\nequipped with morphisms ev0\nX : X ⊗ ∗X → 1 and coev0\nX : 1 → ∗X ⊗ X\nsuch that the compositions\n(1.10.3)\nIdX ⊗coev0\na-1\nX ⊗IdX\nX,∗X,X\nev0\nX\nX ------→ X ⊗ (∗X ⊗ X) ----→ (X ⊗ ∗X) ⊗ X -----→ X,\n(1.10.4)\nX ⊗Id∗X\nId∗X ⊗ev0\ncoev0\na∗X,X,∗X\nX\n∗X -------→ (∗X ⊗ X) ⊗ ∗X -----→ ∗X ⊗ (X ⊗ ∗X) - ----→ X∗\nare the identity morphisms.\nRemark 1.10.3. It is obvious that if X∗ is a right dual of an object\nX then X is a left dual of X∗ with ev0\nX∗ = evX and coev0\nX∗ = coevX ,\nand vice versa. Also, in any monoidal category, 1∗ = ∗1 = 1 with the\nstructure morphisms ι and ι-1 . Also note that changing the order of\ntensor product switches right duals and left duals, so to any statement\nabout right duals there corresponds a symmetric statement about left\nduals.\nProposition 1.10.4. If X ∈C has a right (respectively, left) dual\nobject, then it is unique up to a unique isomorphism.\nProof. Let X1\n∗, X2\n∗ be two right duals to X. Denote by e1, c1, e2, c2 the\ncorresponding evaluation and coevaluation morphisms. Then we have\n\n/ /\n\n+ +\nWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW\n/ /\n/ /\n\n/ /\n/ /\na morphism α : X1\n∗\nX2\n∗ defined as the composition\n→\nIdX∗\na-1\n,X,X∗\ne1⊗IdX∗\n1 ⊗c2\nX1\n∗\nX1\n∗ ----→ X1\n∗ ⊗ (X ⊗ X2\n∗) -----→ (X1\n∗ ⊗ X) ⊗ X2\n∗ - ---→ X2\n∗.\nSimilarly one defines a morphism β : X2\n∗\nX1\n∗. We claim that β\nα\n→\n*\nand α\nβ are the identity morphisms, so α is an isomorphism. Indeed\n*\nconsider the following diagram:\nX1\n∗\nId ⊗c1\nX1\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X1\n∗\nId\nId ⊗c2\nId ⊗c2⊗Id\nX1\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X2\n∗\nId ⊗c1 X1\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X2\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X1\n∗\nId ⊗e2⊗Id\nX1\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X1\n∗\ne1⊗Id\ne1⊗Id\ne1⊗Id\nX2\n∗\nId ⊗c1\nX2\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X1\n∗\ne2⊗Id\nX1\n∗.\nHere we suppress the associativity constraints. It is clear that the three\nsmall squares commute. The triangle in the upper right corner com\nmutes by axiom (1.10.1) applied to X2\n∗. Hence, the perimeter of the\ndiagram commutes. The composition through the top row is the iden\ntity by (1.10.2) applied to X1\n∗. The composition through the bottom\nrow is β\nα and so β\nα = Id. The proof of α\nβ = Id is completely\n*\n*\n*\nsimilar.\nMoreover, it is easy to check that α : X1\n∗\nX2\n∗ is the only iso\n→\nmorphism which preserves the evaluation and coevaluation morphisms.\nThis proves the proposition for right duals. The proof for left duals is\nsimilar.\n\nExercise 1.10.5. Fill in the details in the proof of Proposition 1.10.4.\nIf X, Y are objects in C which have right duals X∗, Y ∗ and f : X → Y\nis a morphism, one defines the right dual f ∗ : Y ∗\nX∗ of f as the\n→\ncomposition\na-1\nY ∗ IdY ∗ ⊗coevX\nY ∗,X,X∗\n(1.10.5)\n-------→ Y ∗ ⊗ (X ⊗ X∗) -----→ (Y ∗ ⊗ X) ⊗ X∗\n(IdY ∗ ⊗f)⊗IdX∗\nevY ⊗IdX∗\n---------→ (Y ∗ ⊗ Y ) ⊗ X∗ - ----→ X∗.\nSimilarly, if X, Y are objects in C which have left duals ∗X, ∗Y and\nf : X\nY is a morphism, one defines the left dual ∗f : ∗Y\n∗X of f\n→\n→\nas the composition\nX ⊗Id∗Y\ncoev0\na∗X,X,∗Y\n(1.10.6)\n∗Y -------→ (∗X ⊗ X) ⊗ ∗Y -----→ ∗X ⊗ (X ⊗ ∗Y )\nId∗X ⊗(f⊗Id∗Y )\nId∗X ⊗ev0\nY\n---------→ ∗X ⊗ (Y ⊗ ∗Y ) - ----→ ∗X.\n\nExercise 1.10.6. Let C, D be monoidal categories. Suppose\n(F, J) : C →D\nis a monoidal functor with the corresponding isomorphism φ : 1 →\nF (1). Let X be an object in C with a right dual X∗. Prove that\nF (X∗) is a right dual of F (X) with the evaluation and coevaluation\ngiven by\nJX,X∗\nF (evX )\nevF (X) : F (X∗) ⊗ F (X) ---→ F (X∗ ⊗ X) ----→ F (1) = 1,\nJ-1\nF (coevX )\nX,X∗\ncoevF (X) : 1 = F (1) -----→ F (X ⊗ X∗) ---→ F (X) ⊗ F (X∗).\nState and prove a similar result for left duals.\nProposition 1.10.7.

Prove Proposition 1.10.7.\nProposition 1.10.9.

The isomorphism in (1.10.7) is given by\nf 7→ (f ⊗ IdV ∗ ) * (IdU ⊗ coevV )\nand has the inverse\ng 7→ (IdW ⊗ evV )\n(g ⊗ IdV ).\n*\n\nThe other isomorphisms are similar, and are left to the reader as an\nexercise. 7\n\nRemark 1.10.10. Proposition 1.10.9 provides another proof of Propo\nsition 1.10.4. Namely, setting U = 1 and V = X in (1.10.8), we obtain\na natural isomorphism Hom(X∗, W ) ∼Hom(1, X ⊗ W ) for any right\n=\ndual X∗ of X. Hence, if Y1, Y2 are two such duals then there is a\nnatural isomorphism Hom(Y1, W ) ∼Hom(Y2, W ), whence there is a\n=\ncanonical isomorphism Y1 ∼= Y2 by Yoneda's Lemma. The proof for left\nduals is similar.\nDefinition 1.10.11. A monoidal category C is called rigid if every\nobject X ∈C has a right dual object and a left dual object.\nExample 1.10.12. The category Vec of finite dimensional k-vector\nspaces is rigid: the right and left dual to a finite dimensional vector\nspace V are its dual space V ∗, with the evaluation map evV : V ∗ ⊗V →\nk being the contraction, and the coevaluation map coevV : k → V ⊗V ∗\nbeing the usual embedding. On the other hand, the category Vec of\nall k-vector spaces is not rigid, since for infinite dimensional spaces\nthere is no coevaluation maps (indeed, suppose that c : k\nV ⊗ Y\n→\nis a coevaluation map, and consider the subspace V 0 of V spanned by\nthe first component of c(1); this subspace finite dimensional, and yet\nthe composition V → V ⊗ Y ⊗ V → V , which is supposed to be the\nidentity map, lands in V 0 - a contradiction).\nExample 1.10.13. The category Rep(G) of finite dimensional\nk-representations of a group G is rigid: for a finite dimensional rep\nresentation V , the (left or right) dual representation V ∗ is the usual\ndual space (with the evaluation and coevaluation maps as in Example\n1.10.12), and with the G-action given by ρV ∗ (g) = (ρV (g)-1)∗. Simi\nlarly, the category Rep(g) of finite dimensional representations of a Lie\nalgebra g is rigid, with ρV ∗ (a) = -ρV (a)∗.\nExample 1.10.14. The category VecG is rigid if and only if the monoid\nG is a group; namely, δg\n∗ = ∗δg = δg-1 (with the obvious structure\nmaps). More generally, for any group G and 3-cocycle ω ∈ Z3(G, k×),\nthe category Vecω\nG is rigid. Namely, assume for simplicity that the\ncocycle ω is normalized (as we know, we can do so without loss of\ngenerality). Then we can define duality as above, and normalize the\ncoevaluation morphisms of δg to be the identities. The evaluation mor\nphisms will then be defined by the formula evδg = ω(g, g-1, g).\n7A convenient way to do computations in this and previous Propositions is using\nthe graphical calculus (see [K, Chapter XIV]).\n\nIt follows from Proposition 1.10.4 that in a monoidal category C\nwith right (respectively, left) duals, one can define the (contravariant)\nright (respectively, left) duality functor C →C by X 7→ X∗, f 7→ f ∗\n(respectively, X 7→ ∗X, f 7→ ∗f) for every object X and morphism f in\nC. By Proposition 1.10.7(ii), these functors are anti-monoidal, in the\nsense that they define monoidal functors C∨ →Cop; hence the functors\nX\nX∗∗, X\n∗∗X are monoidal. Also, it follows from Proposition\n→\n→\n1.10.9 that the functors of right and left duality, when they are defined,\nare fully faithful (it suffices to use (i) for U = X∗, V = Y, W = 1).\nMoreover, it follows from Remark 1.10.3 that in a rigid monoidal cat\negory, the functors of right and left duality are mutually quasi-inverse\nmonoidal equivalences of categories C∨ →Cop (so for rigid categories,\nthe two notions of opposite category are the same up to equivalence).\nThis implies that the functors X\nX∗∗, X\n∗∗X are mutually\n→\n→\nquasi-inverse monoidal autoequivalences. We will see later in Example\n1.27.2 that these autoequivalences may be nontrivial; in particular, it\nis possible that objects V ∗ and ∗V are not isomorphic.\nExercise 1.10.15. Show that if C, D are rigid monoidal categories,\nF1, F2 : C →D are monoidal functors, and η : F1 → F2 is a morphism\nof monoidal functors, then η is an isomorphism.8\nExercise 1.10.16. Let A be an algebra. Show that M ∈ A - bimod\nhas a left (respectively, right) dual if and only if it is finitely generated\nprojective when considered as a left (respectively, right) A-module.\nSinilarly, if A is commutative, M ∈ A - mod has a left and right dual\nif and only if it is finitely generated projective.\n1.11. Invertible objects. Let C be a rigid monoidal category.\nDefinition 1.11.1. An object X in C is invertible if evX : X∗ ⊗X → 1\nand coevX : 1 → X ⊗ X∗ are isomorphisms.\nClearly, this notion categorifies the notion of an invertible element\nin a monoid.\nExample 1.11.2. The objects δg in Vecω are invertible.\nG\nProposition 1.11.3. Let X be an invertible object in C. Then\n(i) ∗X ∼= X∗ and X∗ is invertible;\n(ii) if Y is another invertible object then X ⊗ Y is invertible.\nProof. Dualizing coevX and evX we get isomorphisms X ⊗ ∗X = 1\n∼\nand ∗X ⊗ X ∼1.\n=\n=\nIn any rigid\n=\nHence ∗X ∼∗X ⊗ X ⊗ X∗ ∼X∗.\ncategory the evaluation and coevaluation morphisms for ∗X can be\n8As we have seen in Remark 1.6.6, this is false for non-rigid categories.\n\ndefined by ev∗X := ∗coevX and coev∗X := ∗evX , so ∗X is invertible.\nThe second statement follows from the fact that evX⊗Y can be defined\nas a composition of evX and evY and similarly coevX⊗Y can be defined\nas a composition of coevY and coevX .\n\nProposition 1.11.3 implies that invertible objects of C form a monoidal\nsubcategory Inv(C) of C.\nExample 1.11.4. Gr-categories. Let us classify rigid monoidal cat\negories C where all objects are invertible and all morphisms are iso\nmorphisms. We may assume that C is skeletal, i.e. there is only one\nobject in each isomorphism class, and objects form a group G. Also,\nby Proposition 1.2.7, End(1) is an abelian group; let us denote it by\nA. Then for any g ∈ G we can identify End(g) with A, by sending\nf ∈ End(g) to f ⊗ Idg-1 ∈ End(1) = A. Then we have an action of G\non A by\na ∈ End(1) 7→ g(a) := Idg ⊗ a ∈ End(g).\nLet us now consider the associativity isomorphism. It is defined by a\nfunction ω : G × G × G\nA. The pentagon relation gives\n→\n(1.11.1)\nω(g1g2, g3, g4)ω(g1, g2, g3g4) = ω(g1, g2, g3)ω(g1, g2g3, g4)g1(ω(g2, g3, g4)),\nfor all g1, g2, g3, g4 ∈ G, which means that ω is a 3-cocycle of G with\ncoefficients in the (generally, nontrivial) G-module A. We see that any\nsuch 3-cocycle defines a rigid monoidal category, which we will call\nCω (A). The analysis of monoidal equivalences between such categories\nG\nis similar to the case when A is a trivial G-module, and yields that\nfor a given group G and G-module A, equivalence classes of Cω are\nG\nparametrized by H3(G, A)/Out(G).\nCategories of the form Cω (A) are called Gr-categories, and were stud-\nG\nied in [Si].\n1.12. Tensor and multitensor categories. Now we will start con\nsidering monoidal structures on abelian categories. For the sake of\nbrevity, we will not recall the basic theory of abelian categories; let us\njust recall the Freyd-Mitchell theorem stating that abelian categories\ncan be characterized as full subcategories of categories of left modules\nover rings, which are closed under taking direct sums, as well as ker\nnels, cokernels, and images of morphisms. This allows one to visualize\nthe main concepts of the theory of abelian categories in terms of the\nclassical theory of modules over rings.\nRecall that an abelian category C is said to be k-linear (or defined\nover k) if for any X, Y in C, Hom(X, Y ) is a k-vector space, and com\nposition of morphisms is bilinear.\n\nDefinition 1.12.1. A k-linear abelian category is said to be locally\nfinite if it is essentially small9, and the following two conditions are\nsatisfied:\n(i) for any two objects X, Y in C, the space Hom(X, Y ) is finite\ndimensional;\n(ii) every object in C has finite length.\nAlmost all abelain categories we will consider will be locally finite.\nProposition 1.12.2. In a locally finite abelian category C, Hom(X, Y ) =\n0 if X, Y are simple and non-isomorphic, and Hom(X, X) = k for any\nsimple object X.\nProof. Recall Schur's lemma: if X, Y are simple objects of an abelian\ncategory, and f ∈ Hom(X, Y ), then f = 0 or f is an isomorphism. This\nimplies that Hom(X, Y ) = 0 if X, Y are simple and non-isomorphic,\nand Hom(X, X) is a division algebra; since k is algebraically closed,\ncondition (i) implies that Hom(X, X) = k for any simple object X ∈\nC.\n\nAlso, the Jordan-H older and Krull-Schmidt theorems hold in any\nlocally finite abelian category C.\nDefinition 1.12.3. Let C be a locally finite k-linear abelian rigid\nmonoidal category. We will call C a multitensor category over k if\nthe bifunctor ⊗ is bilinear on morphisms. If in addition End(1) ∼k\n=\nthen we will call C a tensor category.\nA multifusion category is a semisimple multitensor category with\nfinitely many isomorphism simple objects. A fusion category is a semisim\nple tensor category with finitely many isomorphism simple objects.\nExample 1.12.4. The categories Vec of finite dimensional k-vector\nspaces, Rep(G) of finite dimensional k-representations of a group G\n(or algebraic representations of an affine algebraic group G), Rep(g)\nof finite dimensional representations of a Lie algebra g, and Vecω of\nG\nG-graded finite dimensional k-vector spaces with associativity defined\nby a 3-cocycle ω are tensor categories. If G is a finite group, Rep(G)\nis a fusion category. In particular, Vec is a fusion category.\nExample 1.12.5. Let A be a finite dimensional semisimple algebra\nover k. Let A-bimod be the category of finite dimensional A-bimodules\nwith bimodule tensor product over A, i.e.,\n(M, N) 7→ M ⊗A N.\n9Recall that a category is called essentially small if its isomorphism classes of\nobjects form a set.\n\nThen C is a multitensor category with the unit object 1 = A, the left\ndual defined by M 7→ Hom(AM, AA), and the right dual defined by\nM 7→ Hom(MA, AA).10 The category C is tensor if and only if A is\nsimple, in which case it is equivalent to k - Vec. More generally, if\nA has n matrix blocks, the category C can be alternatively described\nas the category whose objects are n-by-n matrices of vector spaces,\nV = (Vij ), and the tensor product is matrix multiplication:\n(V ⊗ W )il = ⊕j\nn\n=1Vij ⊗ Wjl.\nThis category will be denoted by Mn(Vec). It is a multifusion category.\nIn a similar way, one can define the multitensor category Mn(C) of\nn-by-n matrices of objects of a given multitensor category C. If C is a\nmultifusion category, so is Mn(C).\n10Note that if A is a finite dimensional non-semisimple algebra then the category\nof finite dimensional A-bimodules is not rigid, since the duality functors defined as\nabove do not satisfy rigidity axioms (cf. Exercise 1.10.16).\n\n1.13. Exactness of the tensor product.\nProposition 1.13.1. (see [BaKi, 2.1.8]) Let C be a multitensor cate\ngory. Then the bifunctor ⊗ : C × C →C is exact in both factors (i.e.,\nbiexact).\nProof. The proposition follows from the fact that by Proposition 1.10.9,\nthe functors V ⊗ and ⊗V have left and right adjoint functors (the\nfunctors of tensoring with the corresponding duals), and any functor\nbetween abelian categories which has a left and a right adjoint functor\nis exact.\n\nRemark 1.13.2. The proof of Proposition 1.13.1 shows that the bi\nadditivity of the functor ⊗ holds automatically in any rigid monoidal\nabelian category. However, this is not the case for bilinearity of ⊗,\nand thus condition of bilinearity of tensor product in the definition of\na multitensor category is not redundant.\nThis may be illustrated by the following example. Let C be the\ncategory of finite dimensional C-bimodules in which the left and right\nactions of R coincide. This category is C-linear abelian; namely, it is\nsemisimple with two simple objects C+ = 1 and C-, both equal to\nC as a real vector space, with bimodule structures (a, b)z = azb and\n(a, b)z = azb, respectively. It is also also rigid monoidal, with ⊗ being\nthe tensor product of bimodules. But the tensor product functor is not\nC-bilinear on morphisms (it is only R-bilinear).\nDefinition 1.13.3. A multiring category over k is a locally finite k-\nlinear abelian monoidal category C with biexact tensor product. If in\naddition End(1) = k, we will call C a ring category.\nThus, the difference between this definition and the definition of a\n(multi)tensor category is that we don't require the existence of duals,\nbut instead require the biexactness of the tensor product. Note that\nProposition 1.13.1 implies that any multitensor category is a multiring\ncategory, and any tensor category is a ring category.\nCorollary 1.13.4. For any pair of morphisms f1, f2 in a multiring\ncategory C one has Im(f1 ⊗ f2) = Im(f1) ⊗ Im(f2).\nProof. Let I1, I2 be the images of f1, f2. Then the morphisms fi : Xi →\nYi, i = 1, 2, have decompositions Xi → Ii → Yi, where the sequences\nXi → Ii → 0, 0 → Ii → Yi\nare exact. Tensoring the sequence X1 → I1 → 0 with I2, by Proposition\n1.13.1, we get the exact sequence\nX1 ⊗ I2 → I1 ⊗ I2 → 0\n\nTenosring X1 with the sequence X2\nI2\n0, we get the exact se\n→\n→\nquence\nX1 ⊗ X2 → X1 ⊗ I2 → 0.\nCombining these, we get an exact sequence\nX1 ⊗ X2 → I1 ⊗ I2 → 0.\nArguing similarly, we show that the sequence\nI1 ⊗ I2 → Y1 ⊗ Y2\n→\nis exact. This implies the statement.\n\nProposition 1.13.5. If C is a multiring category with right duals, then\nthe right dualization functor is exact. The same applies to left duals.\nProof. Let 0\nX\nY\nZ\n0 be an exact sequence. We need to\n→\n→\n→\n→\nshow that the sequence 0\nZ∗\nY ∗\nX∗\n0 is exact. Let T be\n→\n→\n→\n→\nany object of C, and consider the sequence\nHom(T, Z∗)\nHom(T, Y ∗)\nHom(T, X∗).\n→\n→\n→\nBy Proposition 1.10.9, it can be written as\nHom(T ⊗ Z, 1)\nHom(T ⊗ Y, 1)\nHom(T ⊗ X, 1),\n→\n→\n→\nwhich is exact, since the sequence\nT ⊗ X\nT ⊗ Y\nT ⊗ Z\n→\n→\n→\nis exact, by the exactness of the functor T ⊗. This implies that the\nsequence 0\nZ∗\nY ∗\nX∗ is exact.\n→\n→\n→\nSimilarly, consider the sequence\nHom(X∗, T )\nHom(Y ∗, T )\nHom(Z∗, T ).\n→\n→\n→\nBy Proposition 1.10.9, it can be written as\nHom(1, X ⊗ T )\nHom(1, Y ⊗ T )\nHom(1, Z ⊗ T ),\n→\n→\n→\nwhich is exact since the sequence\nX ⊗ T\nY ⊗ T\nZ ⊗ T\n→\n→\n→\nis exact, by the exactness of the functor ⊗T . This implies that the\nsequence Z∗\nY ∗\nX∗\n0 is exact.\n\n→\n→\n→\nProposition 1.13.6. Let P be a projective object in a multiring cate\ngory C. If X ∈C has a right dual, then the object P ⊗ X is projective.\nSimilarly, if X ∈C has a left dual, then the object X ⊗ P is projective.\n\nProof. In the first case by Proposition 1.10.9 we have Hom(P ⊗X, Y ) =\nHom(P, Y ⊗X∗), which is an exact functor of Y , since the functors ⊗X∗\nand Hom(P, ) are exact. So P ⊗ X is projective. The second case is\n-\nsimilar.\n\nCorollary 1.13.7. If C multiring category with right duals, then 1 ∈C\nis a projective object if and only if C is semisimple.\nProof. If 1 is projective then for any X ∈C, X ∼= 1 ⊗ X is projective.\nThis implies that C is semisimple. The converse is obvious.\n\n1.14. Quasi-tensor and tensor functors.\nDefinition 1.14.1. Let C, D be multiring categories over k, and F :\nC →D be an exact and faithful functor.\n(i) F is said to be a quasi-tensor functor if it is equipped with a\nfunctorial isomorphism J : F ( ) ⊗ F ( )\nF (- ⊗-), and F (1) = 1.\n-\n- →\n(ii) A quasi-tensor functor (F, J) is said to be a tensor functor if J\nis a monoidal structure (i.e., satisfies the monoidal structure axiom).\nExample 1.14.2. The functors of Examples 1.6.1,1.6.2 and Subsection\n1.7 (for the categories Vecω\nG) are tensor functors. The identity functor\nVecω1\nV ecω2 for non-cohomologous 3-cocycles ω1, ω2 is not a tensor\nG\nG\n→\nfunctor, but it can be made quasi-tensor by any choice of J.\n1.15. Semisimplicity of the unit object.\nTheorem 1.15.1. In any multiring category, End(1) is a semisimple\nalgebra, so it is isomorphic to a direct sum of finitely many copies of\nk.\nProof. By Proposition 1.2.7, End(1) is a commutative algebra, so it is\nsufficient to show that for any a ∈ End(1) such that a2 = 0 we have\na = 0. Let J = Im(a). Then by Corollary 1.13.4 J ⊗ J = Im(a ⊗ a) =\nIm(a2 ⊗ 1) = 0.\nNow let K = Ker(a). Then by Corollary 1.13.4, K ⊗ J is the image\nof 1 ⊗ a on K ⊗ 1. But since K ⊗ 1 is a subobject of 1 ⊗ 1, this is the\nsame as the image of a ⊗ 1 on K ⊗ 1, which is zero. So K ⊗ J = 0.\nNow tensoring the exact sequence 0\nK\nJ\n0 with J,\n→\n→\n→\n→\nand applying Proposition 1.13.1, we get that J = 0, so a = 0.\n\nLet {pi}i∈I be the primitive idempotents of the algebra End(1). Let\n1i be the image of pi. Then we have 1 = ⊕i∈I 1i.\nCorollary 1.15.2. In any multiring category C the unit object 1 is\nisomorphic to a direct sum of pairwise non-isomorphic indecomposable\nobjects: 1 ∼= ⊕i 1i.\n\nExercise 1.15.3. One has 1i ⊗ 1j = 0 for i =6\nj. There are canonical\nisomorphisms 1i ⊗ 1i ∼\n= 1i∗.\n= 1i, and 1i ∼\nLet Cij := 1i ⊗C ⊗ 1j .\nDefinition 1.15.4. The subcategories Cij will be called the component\nsubcategories of C.\nProposition 1.15.5. Let C be a multiring category.\n(1) C = ⊕i,j∈I Cij . Thus every indecomposable object of C belongs\nto some Cij .\n(2) The tensor product maps Cij × Ckl to Cil, and it is zero unless\nj = k.\n(3) The categories Cii are ring categories with unit objects 1i (which\nare tensor categories if C is rigid).\n(3) The functors of left and right duals, if they are defined, map Cij\nto Cji.\nExercise 1.15.6. Prove Proposition 1.15.5.\nProposition 1.15.5 motivates the terms \"multiring category\" and\n\"multitensor category\", as such a category gives us multiple ring cate\ngories, respectively tensor categories Cii.\nRemark 1.15.7. Thus, a multiring category may be considered as a\n2-category with objects being elements of I, 1-morphisms from j to i\nforming the category Cij , and 2-morphisms being 1-morphisms in C.\nTheorem 1.15.8. (i) In a ring category with right duals, the unit\nobject 1 is simple.\n(ii) In a multiring category with right duals, the unit object 1 is\nsemisimple, and is a direct sum of pairwise non-isomorphic simple ob\njects 1i.\nProof. Clearly, (i) implies (ii) (by applying (i) to the component cate\ngories Cii). So it is enough to prove (i).\nLet X be a simple subobject of 1 (it exists, since 1 has finite length).\nLet\n(1.15.1)\n0 -→ X -→ 1 -→ Y -→ 0\nbe the corresponding exact sequence. By Proposition 1.13.5, the right\ndualization functor is exact, so we get an exact sequence\n(1.15.2)\n0 -→ Y ∗ -→ 1 -→ X∗ -→ 0.\nTensoring this sequence with X on the left, we obtain\n(1.15.3)\n0 -→ X ⊗ Y ∗ -→ X -→ X ⊗ X∗ -→ 0,\n\nP\nSince X is simple and X ⊗X∗ = 0 (because the coevaluation morphism\nis nonzero) we obtain that X ⊗ X∗ = X. So we have a surjective\n∼\ncomposition morphism 1 → X ⊗ X∗ → X. From this and (1.15.1) we\nhave a nonzero composition morphism 1 X ,\n1. Since End(1) = k,\nthis morphism is a nonzero scalar, whence X =\n→\n1.\n\nCorollary 1.15.9. In a ring category with right duals, the evaluation\nmorphisms are surjective and the coevaluation morphisms are injective.\nExercise 1.15.10. Let C be a multiring category with right duals. and\nX ∈Cij and Y ∈Cjk be nonzero.\n(a) Show that X ⊗ Y = 0.\n(b) Deduce that length(X ⊗ Y ) ≥ length(X)length(Y ).\n(c) Show that if C is a ring category with right duals then an in\nvertible object in C is simple.\n(d) Let X be an object in a multiring category with right duals\nsuch that X ⊗ X∗ ∼\nShow that X is invertible.\n= 1.\nExample 1.15.11. An example of a ring category where the unit ob\nject is not simple is the category C of finite dimensional representations\nof the quiver of type A2. Such representations are triples (V, W, A),\nwhere V, W are finite dimensional vector spaces, and A : V\nW is a\n→\nlinear operator. The tensor product on such triples is defined by the\nformula\n(V, W, A) ⊗ (V 0, W 0, A0) = (V ⊗ V 0, W ⊗ W 0, A ⊗ A0),\nwith obvious associativity isomorphisms, and the unit object (k, k, Id).\nOf course, this category has neither right nor left duals.\n1.16. Grothendieck rings. Let C be a locally finite abelian category\nover k. If X and Y are objects in C such that Y is simple then we denote\nby [X : Y ] the multiplicity of Y in the Jordan-H older composition series\nof X.\nRecall that the Grothendieck group Gr(C) is the free abelian group\ngenerated by isomorphism classes Xi, i ∈ I of simple objects in C,\nand that to every object X in C we can canonically associate its class\n[X] ∈ Gr(C) given by the formula [X] =\n[X : Xi]Xi. It is obvious\ni\nthat if\n0 -→ X -→ Y -→ Z -→ 0\nthen [Y ] = [X] + [Z]. When no confusion is possible, we will write X\ninstead of [X].\n\nX\nX\nX\nNow let C be a multiring category. The tensor product on C induces\na natural multiplication on Gr(C) defined by the formula\nXiXj := [Xi ⊗ Xj ] =\n[Xi ⊗ Xj : Xk]Xk.\nk∈I\nLemma 1.16.1. The above multiplication on Gr(C) is associative.\nProof. Since the tensor product functor is exact,\n[(Xi ⊗ Xj ) ⊗ Xp : Xl] =\n[Xi ⊗ Xj : Xk][Xk ⊗ Xp : Xl].\nk\nOn the other hand,\n[Xi ⊗ (Xj ⊗ Xp) : Xl] =\n[Xj ⊗ Xp : Xk][Xi ⊗ Xk : Xl].\nk\nThus the associativity of the multiplication follows from the isomor\nphism (Xi ⊗ Xj ) ⊗ Xp ∼= Xi ⊗ (Xj ⊗ Xp).\n\nThus Gr(C) is an associative ring with the unit 1. It is called the\nGrothendieck ring of C.\nThe following proposition is obvious.\nProposition 1.16.2. Let C and D be multiring categories and F : C →\nD be a quasi-tensor functor. Then F defines a homomorphism of unital\nrings [F ] : Gr(C)\nGr(D).\n→\nThus, we see that (multi)ring categories categorify rings (which jus\ntifies the terminology), while quasi-tensor (in particular, tensor) func\ntors between them categorify unital ring homomorphisms. Note that\nProposition 1.15.5 may be regarded as a categorical analog of the Peirce\ndecomposition in classical algebra.\n1.17. Groupoids. The most basic examples of multitensor categories\narise from finite groupoids. Recall that a groupoid is a small category\nwhere all morphisms are isomorphisms. Thus a groupoid G entails a set\nX of objects of G and a set G of morphisms of G, the source and target\nmaps s, t : G\nX, the composition map μ : G ×X G\nG (where the\n→\n→\nfibered product is defined using s in the first factor and using t in the\nsecond factor), the unit morphism map u : X\nG, and the inversion\n→\nmap i : G\nG satisfying certain natural axioms, see e.g. [Ren] for\n→\nmore details.\nHere are some examples of groupoids.\n(1) Any group G is a groupoid G with a single object whose set of\nmorphisms to itself is G.\n\nM\n(2) Let X be a set and let G = X × X. Then the product groupoid\nG(X) := (X, G) is a groupoid in which s is the first projection,\nt is the second projection, u is the diagonal map, and i is the\npermutation of factors. In this groupoid for any x, y ∈ X there\nis a unique morphism from x to y.\n(3) A more interesting example is the transformation groupoid T (G, X)\narising from the action of a group G on a set X. The set\nof objects of T (G, X) is X, and arrows correspond to triples\n(g, x, y) where y = gx with an obvious composition law. In\nother words, the set of morphisms is G × X and s(g, x) =\nx, t(g, x) = gx, u(x) = (1, x), i(g, x) = (g-1, gx).\nLet G = (X, G, μ, s, t, u, i) be a finite groupoid (i.e., G is finite) and let\nC(G) be the category of finite dimensional vector spaces graded by the\nset G of morphisms of G, i.e., vector spaces of the form V = ⊕g∈G Vg.\nIntroduce a tensor product on C(G) by the formula\n(1.17.1)\n(V ⊗ W )g =\nVg1 ⊗ Wg2 .\n(g1,g2):g1g2=g\nThen C(G) is a multitensor category. The unit object is 1 = ⊕x∈X 1x,\nwhere 1x is a 1-dimensional vector space which sits in degree idx in G.\nThe left and right duals are defined by (V ∗)g = (∗V )g = Vg-1 .\nWe invite the reader to check that the component subcategories\nC(G)xy are the categories of vector spaces graded by Mor(y, x).\nWe see that C(G) is a tensor category if and only if G is a group,\nwhich is the case of VecG already considered in Example 1.3.6. Note\nalso that if X = {1, ..., n} then C(G(X)) is naturally equivalent to\nMn(Vec).\nExercise 1.17.1. Let Ci be isomorphism classes of objects in a finite\ngroupoid G, ni = |Ci|, xi ∈ Ci be representatives of Ci, and Gi =\nAut(xi) be the corresponding automorphism groups. Show that C(G)\nis (non-canonically) monoidally equivalent to ⊕iMni (VecGi ).\nRemark 1.17.2. The finite length condition in Definition 1.12.3 is\nnot superfluous: there exists a rigid monoidal k-linear abelian category\nwith bilinear tensor product which contains objects of infinite length.\nAn example of such a category is the category C of Jacobi matrices of\nfinite dimensional vector spaces. Namely, the objects of C are semi-\ninfinite matrices V = {Vij }ij∈Z+ of finite dimensional vector spaces Vij\nwith finitely many non-zero diagonals, and morphisms are matrices of\nlinear maps. The tensor product in this category is defined by the\n\nX\nformula\n(1.17.2)\n(V ⊗ W )il =\nVij ⊗ Wjl,\nj\nand the unit object 1 is defined by the condition 1ij = kδij . The left\nand right duality functors coincide and are given by the formula\n(1.17.3)\n(V ∗)ij = (Vji)∗.\nThe evaluation map is the direct sum of the canonical maps Vij\n∗ ⊗Vij →\n1jj , and the coevaluation map is a direct sum of the canonical maps\n1ii → Vij ⊗ Vij\n∗.\nNote that the category C is a subcategory of the category C0 of G(Z+)\ngraded vector spaces with finite dimensional homogeneous components.\nNote also that the category C0 is not closed under the tensor product\ndefined by (1.17.2) but the category C is.\nExercise 1.17.3.\n(1) Show that if X is a finite set then the group\nof invertible objects of the category C(G(X)) is isomorphic to\nAut(X).\n(2) Let C be the category of Jacobi matrices of vector spaces from\nExample 1.17.2. Show that the statement Exercise 1.15.10(d)\nfails for C. Thus the finite length condition is important in\nExercise 1.15.10.\n1.18. Finite abelian categories and exact faithful functors.\nDefinition 1.18.1. A k-linear abelian category C is said to be finite if\nit is equivalent to the category A - mod of finite dimensional modules\nover a finite dimensional k-algebra A.\nOf course, the algebra A is not canonically attached to the category\nC; rather, C determines the Morita equivalence class of A. For this\nreason, it is often better to use the following \"intrinsic\" definition,\nwhich is well known to be equivalent to Definition 1.18.1:\nDefinition 1.18.2. A k-linear abelian category C is finite if\n(i) C has finite dimensional spaces of morphisms;\n(ii) every object of C has finite length;\n(iii) C has enough projectives, i.e., every simple object of C has a\nprojective cover; and\n(iv) there are finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects.\nNote that the first two conditions are the requirement that C be\nlocally finite.\nIndeed, it is clear that if A is a finite dimensional algebra then A -\nmod clearly satisfies (i)-(iv), and conversely, if C satisfies (i)-(iv), then\n\none can take A = End(P )op, where P is a projective generator of C (e.g.,\nP = ⊕i\nn\n=1Pi, where Pi are projective covers of all the simple objects\nXi).\nA projective generator P of C represents a functor F = FP : C → Vec\nfrom C to the category of finite dimensional k-vector spaces, given by\nthe formula F (X) = Hom(P, X). The condition that P is projective\ntranslates into the exactness property of F , and the condition that\nP is a generator (i.e., covers any simple object) translates into the\nproperty that F is faithful (does not kill nonzero objects or morphisms).\nMoreover, the algebra A = End(P )op can be alternatively defined as\nEnd(F ), the algebra of functorial endomorphisms of F . Conversely,\nit is well known (and easy to show) that any exact faithful functor\nF : C → Vec is represented by a unique (up to a unique isomorphism)\nprojective generator P .\nNow let C be a finite k-linear abelian category, and F1, F2 : C → Vec\nbe two exact faithful functors. Define the functor F1 ⊗F2 : C×C → Vec\nby (F1 ⊗ F2)(X, Y ) := F1(X) ⊗ F2(Y ).\nProposition 1.18.3. There is a canonical algebra isomorphism αF1,F2 :\nEnd(F1) ⊗ End(F2) ∼= End(F1 ⊗ F2) given by\nαF1,F2 (η1 ⊗ η2)|F1(X)⊗F2(Y ) := η1|F1(X) ⊗ η2|F2(Y ),\nwhere ηi ∈ End(Fi), i = 1, 2.\nExercise 1.18.4. Prove Proposition 1.18.3.\n1.19. Fiber functors. Let C be a k-linear abelian monoidal category.\nDefinition 1.19.1. A quasi-fiber functor on\nis an exact faithful\nC\nfunctor F : C → Vec from C to the category of finite dimensional\nk-vector spaces, such that F (1) = k, equipped with an isomorphism\nJ : F ( ) ⊗ F ( )\nF (- ⊗-). If in addition J is a monoidal structure\n-\n- →\n(i.e. satisfies the monoidal structure axiom), one says that F is a fiber\nfunctor.\nExample 1.19.2. The forgetful functors VecG → Vec, Rep(G)\nVec\nare naturally fiber functors, while the forgetful functor Vecω →\nVec\nG →\nis quasi-fiber, for any choice of the isomorphism J (we have seen that\nif ω is cohomologically nontrivial, then Vecω does not admit a fiber\nG\nfunctor). Also, the functor Loc(X)\nVec on the category of local\n→\nsystems on a connected topological space X which attaches to a local\nsystem E its fiber Ex at a point x ∈ X is a fiber functor, which justifies\nthe terminology. (Note that if X is Hausdorff, then this functor can be\nidentified with the abovementioned forgetful functor Rep(π1(X, x)) →\nVec).\n\nX\nExercise 1.19.3. Show that if an abelian monoidal category C admits\na quasi-fiber functor, then it is a ring category, in which the object 1\nis simple. So if in addition C is rigid, then it is a tensor category.\n1.20. Coalgebras.\nDefinition 1.20.1. A coalgebra (with counit) over a field k is a k-vector\nspace C together with a comultiplicaton (or coproduct) Δ : C\nC ⊗C\n→\nand counit ε : C\nk such that\n→\n(i) Δ is coassociative, i.e.,\n(Δ ⊗ Id) Δ = (Id ⊗ Δ) Δ\n*\n*\nas maps C\nC⊗3;\n→\n(ii) one has\n(ε ⊗ Id) Δ = (Id ⊗ ε) Δ = Id\n*\n*\nas maps C\nC (the \"counit axiom\").\n→\nDefinition 1.20.2. A left comodule over a coalgebra C is a vector\nspace M together with a linear map π : M\nC ⊗ M (called the\n→\ncoaction map), such that for any m ∈ M, one has\n(Δ ⊗ Id)(π(m)) = (Id ⊗ π)(π(m)), (ε ⊗ Id)(π(m)) = m.\nSimilarly, a right comodule over C is a vector space M together with\na linear map π : M\nM ⊗ C, such that for any m ∈ M, one has\n→\n(π ⊗ Id)(π(m)) = (Id ⊗ Δ)(π(m)), (Id ⊗ ε)(π(m)) = m.\nFor example, C is a left and right comodule with π = Δ, and so is\nk, with π = ε.\nExercise 1.20.3. (i) Show that if C is a coalgebra then C∗ is an\nalgebra, and if A is a finite dimensional algebra then A∗ is a coalgebra.\n(ii) Show that for any coalgebra C, any (left or right) C-comodule\nM is a (respectively, right or left) C∗-module, and the converse is true\nif C is finite dimensional.\nExercise 1.20.4. (i) Show that any coalgebra C is a sum of finite\ndimensional subcoalgebras.\nHint. Let c ∈ C, and let\n(Δ ⊗ Id) * Δ(c) = (Id ⊗ Δ) * Δ(c) =\nc 1\ni ⊗ c 2\ni ⊗ c 3\ni .\ni\nShow that span(c2\ni ) is a subcoalgebra of C containing c.\n(ii) Show that any C-comodule is a sum of finite dimensional subco\nmodules.\n\n( e\n1.21. Bialgebras. Let C be a finite monoidal category, and (F, J) :\nC → Vec be a fiber functor. Consider the algebra H := End(F ). This\nalgebra has two additional structures: the comultiplication Δ : H →\nH ⊗ H and the counit ε : H\nk. Namely, the comultiplication is\n→\ndefined by the formula\nΔ(a) = α-1 Δ(a)),\nF,F\nwhere eΔ(a) ∈ End(F ⊗ F ) is given by\ne\nX,Y aX⊗Y JX,Y ,\nΔ(a)X,Y = J-1\nand the counit is defined by the formula\nε(a) = a1 ∈ k.\nTheorem 1.21.1. (i) The algebra H is a coalgebra with comultiplica\ntion Δ and counit ε.\n(ii) The maps Δ and ε are unital algebra homomorphisms.\nProof. The coassociativity of Δ follows form axiom (1.4.1) of a monoidal\nfunctor. The counit axiom follows from (1.4.3) and (1.4.4). Finally, ob\nserve that for all η, ν ∈ End(F ) the images under αF,F of both Δ(η)Δ(ν)\nand Δ(ην) have components J-1 (ην)X⊗Y JX,Y ; hence, Δ is an algebra\nX,Y\nhomomorphism (which is obviously unital). The fact that ε is a unital\nalgebra homomorphism is clear.\n\nDefinition 1.21.2. An algebra H equipped with a comultiplication Δ\nand a counit ε satisfying properties (i),(ii) of Theorem 1.21.1 is called\na bialgebra.\nThus, Theorem 1.21.1 claims that the algebra H = End(F ) has a\nnatural structure of a bialgebra.\nNow let H be any bialgebra (not necessarily finite dimensional).\nThen the category Rep(H) of representations (i.e., left modules) of\nH and its subcategory Rep(H) of finite dimensional representations\nof H are naturally monoidal categories (and the same applies to right\nmodules). Indeed, one can define the tensor product of two H-modules\nX, Y to be the usual tensor product of vector spaces X ⊗ Y , with the\naction of H defined by the formula\nρX⊗Y (a) = (ρX ⊗ ρY )(Δ(a)), a ∈ H\n(where ρX : H\nEnd(X), ρY : H\nEnd(Y )), the associativity iso\n→\n→\nmorphism to be the obvious one, and the unit object to be the 1\ndimensional space k with the action of H given by the counit, a\nε(a).\n→\nMoreover, the forgetful functor Forget : Rep(H)\nVec is a fiber func\n→\ntor.\n\nP\nP\nX\nThus we see that one has the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.21.3. The assignments (C, F ) 7→ H = End(F ), H 7→\n(Rep(H), Forget) are mutually inverse bijections between\n1) finite abelian k-linear monoidal categories C with a fiber functor\nF , up to monoidal equivalence and isomorphism of monoidal functors;\n2) finite dimensional bialgebras H over k up to isomorphism.\nProof. Straightforward from the above.\n\nTheorem 1.21.3 is called the reconstruction theorem for finite dimen\nsional bialgebras (as it reconstructs the bialgebra H from the category\nof its modules using a fiber functor).\nExercise 1.21.4. Show that the axioms of a bialgebra are self-dual\nin the following sense: if H is a finite dimensional bialgebra with\nmultiplication μ : H ⊗ H\nH, unit i : k\nH, comultiplication\n→\n→\nΔ : H → H ⊗ H and counit ε : H → k, then H∗ is also a bialgebra,\nwith the multiplication Δ∗, unit ε∗, comultiplication μ∗, and counit i∗.\nExercise 1.21.5. (i) Let G be a finite monoid, and C = VecG. Let\nF : C → Vec be the forgetful functor. Show that H = End(F ) is the\nbialgebra Fun(G, k) of k-valued functions on G, with comultiplication\nΔ(f)(x, y) = f(xy) (where we identify H ⊗ H with Fun(G × G, k)),\nand counit ε(f) = f(1).\n(ii) Show that Fun(G, k)∗ = k[G], the monoid algebra of G (with\nbasis x ∈ G and product x y = xy), with coproduct Δ(x) = x ⊗x, and\n·\ncounit ε(x) = 1, x ∈ G. Note that the bialgebra k[G] may be defined\nfor any G (not necessarily finite).\nExercise 1.21.6. Let H be a k-algebra, C = H -mod be the category\nof H-modules, and F : C → Vec be the forgetful functor (we don't\nassume finite dimensionality). Assume that C is monoidal, and F is\ngiven a monoidal structure J. Show that this endows H with the\nstructure of a bialgebra, such that (F, J) defines a monoidal equivalence\nC → Rep(H).\nNote that not only modules, but also comodules over a bialgebra H\nform a monoidal category. Indeed, for a finite dimensional bialgebra,\nthis is clear, as right (respectively, left) modules over H is the same\nthing as left (respectively, right) comodules over H∗. In general, if\nX, Y are, say, right H-comodules, then the right comodule X ⊗ Y is\nthe usual tensor product of X, Y with the coaction map defined as\nfollows: if x ∈ X, y ∈ Y , π(x) =\nxi ⊗ ai, π(y) =\nyj ⊗ bj , then\nπX⊗Y (x ⊗ y) =\nxi ⊗ yj ⊗ aibj .\n\nFor a bialgebra H, the monoidal category of right H-comodules will\nbe denoted by H - comod, and the subcategory of finite dimensional\ncomodules by H - comod.\n1.22. Hopf algebras. Let us now consider the additional structure\non the bialgebra H = End(F ) from the previous subsection in the case\nwhen the category C has right duals. In this case, one can define a\nlinear map S : H\nH by the formula\n→\nS(a)X = a∗\nX∗ ,\nwhere we use the natural identification of F (X)∗ with F (X∗).\nProposition 1.22.1. (\"the antipode axiom\") Let μ : H ⊗ H\nH and\n→\ni : k\nH be the multiplication and the unit maps of H. Then\n→\nμ (Id ⊗ S) Δ = i\nε = μ (S ⊗ Id) Δ\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nas maps H\nH.\n→\nProof. For any b ∈ End(F ⊗F ) the linear map μ*(Id⊗S)(α-1 (b))X , X ∈\nF,F\nC is given by\n(1.22.1)\ncoevF (X)\nbX,X∗\nevF (X)\nF (X) -----→ F (X)⊗F (X)∗⊗F (X) ---→ F (X)⊗F (X)∗⊗F (X) ---→ F (X),\nwhere we suppress the identity isomorphisms, the associativity con\nstraint, and the isomorphism F (X)∗ = F (X∗). Indeed, it suffices to\n∼\ncheck (1.22.1) for b = η ⊗ ν, where η, ν ∈ H, which is straightforward.\nNow the first equality of the proposition follows from the commuta\ntivity of the diagram\ncoevF (X)\n(1.22.2)\nF (X)\n� F (X) ⊗ F (X)∗ ⊗ F (X)\nId\nJX,X∗\nF (coevX )\nF (X)\n� F (X ⊗ X∗) ⊗ F (X)\nη1\nηX⊗X∗\nF (coevX )\nF (X)\n� F (X ⊗ X∗) ⊗ F (X)\nJ-1\nId\nX,X∗\nevF (X)\nF (X) �\nF (X) ⊗ F (X)∗ ⊗ F (X),\nfor any η ∈ End(F ).\nNamely, the commutativity of the upper and the lower square fol\nlows from the fact that upon identification of F (X)∗ with F (X∗), the\nmorphisms evF (X) and coevF (X) are given by the diagrams of Exer\ncise 1.10.6. The middle square commutes by the naturality of η. The\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\ncomposition of left vertical arrows gives ε(η)IdF (X), while the compo\nsition of the top, right, and bottom arrows gives μ (Id ⊗ S) Δ(η).\nThe second equality is proved similarly.\n*\n*\n\nDefinition 1.22.2. An antipode on a bialgebra H is a linear map\nS : H\nH which satisfies the equalities of Proposition 1.22.1.\n→\nExercise 1.22.3. Show that the antipode axiom is self-dual in the\nfollowing sense: if H is a finite dimensional bialgebra with antipode\nSH , then the bialgebra H∗ also admits an antipode SH∗ = S∗\nH .\nThe following is a \"linear algebra\" analog of the fact that the right\ndual, when it exists, is unique up to a unique isomorphism.\nProposition 1.22.4. An antipode on a bialgebra H is unique if exists.\nProof. The proof essentially repeats the proof of uniqueness of right\ndual. Let S, S0 be two antipodes for H. Then using the antipode\nproperties of S, S0, associativity of μ, and coassociativity of Δ, we get\nS = μ * (S ⊗ [μ * (Id ⊗ S0) * Δ]) * Δ =\nμ * (Id ⊗ μ) * (S ⊗ Id ⊗ S0) * (Id ⊗ Δ) * Δ =\nμ * (μ ⊗ Id) * (S ⊗ Id ⊗ S0) * (Δ ⊗ Id) * Δ =\nμ * ([μ * (S ⊗ Id) * Δ] ⊗ S0) * Δ = S0.\nProposition 1.22.5. If S is an antipode on a bialgebra H then S is an\nantihomomorphism of algebras with unit and of coalgebras with counit.\nProof. Let\n(Δ ⊗ Id) Δ(a) = (Id ⊗ Δ) Δ(a) =\n*\n*\na ⊗ a ⊗ a i ,\ni\ni\ni\n(Δ ⊗ Id) Δ(b) = (Id ⊗ Δ) Δ(b) =\nb\n*\n*\nj ⊗ bj ⊗ b\nj\nThen using the definition of the antipode, we have\nj .\ni b)ai S(ai ) =\ni bj )ai bj S(bj )S(ai ) = S(b)S(a).\ni\ni,j\nThus S is an antihomomorphism of algebras (which is obviously unital).\nThe fact that it is an antihomomorphism of coalgebras then follows\nusing the self-duality of the axioms (see Exercises 1.21.4,1.22.3), or can\nbe shown independently by a similar argument.\n\nS(ab) =\nS(a\nS(a\n\nCorollary 1.22.6. (i) If H is a bialgebra with an antipode S, then\nthe abelian monoidal category C = Rep(H) has right duals. Namely,\nfor any object X, the right dual X∗ is the usual dual space of X, with\naction of H given by\nρX∗ (a) = ρX (S(a))∗,\nand the usual evaluation and coevaluation morphisms of the category\nVec.\n(ii) If in addition S is invertible, then C also admits left duals, i.e.\nis rigid (in other words, C is tensor category). Namely, for any object\nX, the left dual ∗X is the usual dual space of X, with action of H given\nby\nρ∗X (a) = ρX (S-1(a))∗,\nand the usual evaluation and coevaluation morphisms of the category\nVec.\nProof. Part (i) follows from the antipode axiom and Proposition 1.22.5.\nPart (ii) follows from part (i) and the fact that the operation of taking\nthe left dual is inverse to the operation of taking the right dual.\n\nRemark 1.22.7. A similar statement holds for finite dimensional co\nmodules. Namely, if X is a finite dimensional right comodule over a\nbialgebra H with an antipode, then the right dual is the usual dual X∗\nwith\n(πX∗ (f), x ⊗ φ) := ((Id ⊗ S)(πX (x)), f ⊗ φ),\nx ∈ X, f ∈ X∗, φ ∈ H∗. If S is invertible, then the left dual ∗X is\ndefined by the same formula with S replaced by S-1 .\nRemark 1.22.8. The fact that S is an antihomomorphism of coalge\nbras is the \"linear algebra\" version of the categorical fact that dualiza\ntion changes the order of tensor product (Proposition 1.10.7(ii)).\nDefinition 1.22.9. A bialgebra equipped with an invertible antipode\nS is called a Hopf algebra.\nRemark 1.22.10. We note that many authors use the term \"Hopf\nalgebra\" for any bialgebra with an antipode.\nThus, Corollary 1.22.6 states that if H is a Hopf algebra then Rep(H)\nis a tensor category. So, we get the following reconstruction theorem\nfor finite dimensional Hopf algebras.\nTheorem 1.22.11. The assignments (C, F ) 7→ H = End(F ), H 7→\n(Rep(H), Forget) are mutually inverse bijections between\n1) finite tensor categories C with a fiber functor F , up to monoidal\nequivalence and isomorphism of monoidal functors;\n\nX\nX\n2) finite dimensional Hopf algebras over k up to isomorphism.\nProof. Straightforward from the above.\n\nExercise 1.22.12. The algebra of functions Fun(G, k) on a finite\nmonoid G is a Hopf algebra if and only if G is a group. In this case,\nthe antipode is given by the formula S(f)(x) = f(x-1), x ∈ G.\nMore generally, if G is an affine algebraic group over k, then the\nalgebra O(G) of regular functions on G is a Hopf algebra, with the\ncomultiplication, counit, and antipode defined as in the finite case.\nSimilarly, k[G] is a Hopf algebra if and only if G is a group, with\nS(x) = x-1 , x ∈ G.\nExercises 1.21.5 and 1.22.12 motivate the following definition:\nDefinition 1.22.13. In any coalgebra C, a nonzero element g ∈ C\nsuch that Δ(g) = g ⊗ g is called a grouplike element.\nExercise 1.22.14. Show that if g is a grouplike of a Hopf algebra H,\nthen g is invertible, with g-1 = S(g). Also, show that the product of\ntwo grouplike elements is grouplike. In particular, grouplike elements\nof any Hopf algebra H form a group, denoted G(H). Show that this\ngroup can also be defined as the group of isomorphism classes of 1\ndimensional H-comodules under tensor multiplication.\nProposition 1.22.15. If H is a finite dimensional bialgebra with an\nantipode S, then S is invertible, so H is a Hopf algebra.\nProof. Let Hn be the image of Sn . Since S is an antihomomorphism\nof algebras and coalgebras, Hn is a Hopf subalgebra of H. Let m be\nthe smallest n such that Hn = Hn+1 (it exists because H is finite\ndimensional). We need to show that m = 0. If not, we can assume\nthat m = 1 by replacing H with Hm-1.\nWe have a map S0 : H1 → H1 inverse to S. For a ∈ H, let the triple\ncoproduct of a be\nX\nai ⊗ ai ⊗ ai .\ni\nConsider the element\nb =\nS0(S(ai\n1))S(ai\n2)ai\n3 .\ni\nOn the one hand, collapsing the last two factors using the antipode\naxiom, we have b = S0(S(a)). On the other hand, writing b as\nb =\nS0(S(ai\n1))S(S0(S(ai\n2)))ai\ni\n\nand collapsing the first two factors using the antipode axiom, we get b =\na. Thus a = S0(S(a)) and thus a ∈ H1, so H = H1, a contradiction.\nExercise 1.22.16. Let μop and Δop be obtained from μ, Δ by permu\ntation of components.\n(i) Show that if (H, μ, i, Δ, ε, S) is a Hopf algebra, then Hop :=\n(H, μop, i, Δ, ε, S-1), Hcop := (H, μ, i, Δop, ε, S-1), Hcop := (H, μop, i, Δop, ε, S)\nop\nare Hopf algebras. Show that H is isomorphic to Hcop, and Hop to Hcop.\nop\n(ii) Suppose that a bialgebra H is a commutative (μ = μop) or co\ncommutative (Δ = Δop). Let S be an antipode on H. Show that\nS2 = 1.\n(iii) Assume that bialgebras H and Hcop have antipodes S and S0.\nShow that S0 = S-1, so H is a Hopf algebra.\nExercise 1.22.17. Show that if A, B are bialgebras, bialgebras with\nantipode, or Hopf algebras, then so is the tensor product A ⊗ B.\nExercise 1.22.18. A finite dimensional module or comodule over a\nHopf algebra is invertible if and only if it is 1-dimensional.\n1.23. Reconstruction theory in the infinite setting. In this sub\nsection we would like to generalize the reconstruction theory to the\nsituation when the category C is not assumed to be finite.\nLet C be any essentially small k-linear abelian category, and F : C →\nVec an exact, faithful functor. In this case one can define the space\nCoend(F ) as follows:\nCoend(F ) := (⊕X∈CF (X)∗ ⊗ F (X))/E\nwhere E is spanned by elements of the form y∗ ⊗ F (f)x - F (f)∗y∗ ⊗ x,\nx ∈ F (X), y∗ ∈ F (Y )∗, f ∈ Hom(X, Y ); in other words, Coend(F ) =\nlim End(F (X))∗. Thus we have End(F ) = lim End(F (X)) = Coend(F )∗,\n-→\n←-\nwhich yields a coalgebra structure on Coend(F ). So the algebra End(F )\n(which may be infinite dimensional) carries the inverse limit topology,\nin which a basis of neighborhoods of zero is formed by the kernels KX\nof the maps End(F ) → End(F (X)), X ∈C, and Coend(F ) = End(F )∨,\nthe space of continuous linear functionals on End(F ).\nThe following theorem is standard (see [Ta2]).\nTheorem 1.23.1. Let C be a k-linear abelian category with an ex\nact faithful functor F :\nVec. Then F defines an equivalence\nC →\nbetween C and the category of finite dimensional right comodules over\nC := Coend(F ) (or, equivalently, with the category of continuous finite\ndimensional left End(F )-modules).\n\nProof. (sketch) Consider the ind-object Q := ⊕X∈CF (X)∗ ⊗ X. For\nX, Y ∈C and f ∈ Hom(X, Y ), let\njf : F (Y )∗ ⊗ X → F (X)∗ ⊗ X ⊕ F (Y )∗ ⊗ Y ⊂ Q\nbe the morphism defined by the formula\njf = Id ⊗ f - F (f)∗ ⊗ Id.\nLet I be the quotient of Q by the image of the direct sum of all jf . In\nother words, I = lim (F (X)∗ ⊗ X).\n-→\nThe following statements are easy to verify:\n(i) I represents the functor F ( )∗, i.e. Hom(X, I) is naturally iso\n-\nmorphic to F (X)∗; in particular, I is injective.\n(ii) F (I) = C, and I is naturally a left C-comodule (the comod\nule structure is induced by the coevaluation morphism F (X)∗ ⊗ X →\nF (X)∗ ⊗ F (X) ⊗ F (X)∗ ⊗ X).\n(iii) Let us regard F as a functor C → C - comod. For M ∈ C -\ncomod, let θM : M ⊗I\nM ⊗C ⊗I be the morphism πM ⊗Id-Id⊗πI ,\n→\nand let KM be the kernel of θM . Then the functor G : C - comod →C\ngiven by the formula G(M) = KerθM , is a quasi-inverse to F .\nThis completes the proof.\n\nNow assume that the abelian category C is also monoidal. Then the\ncoalgebra Coend(F ) also carries a multiplication and unit, dual to the\ncomultiplication and counit of End(F ). More precisely, since End(F )\nmay now be infinite dimensional, the algebra End(F ⊗ F ) is in general\nisomorphic not to the usual tensor product End(F )⊗End(F ), but rather\nto its completion End(F )⊗b End(F ) with respect to the inverse limit\ntopology. Thus the comultiplication of End(F ) is a continuous linear\nmap Δ : End(F ) → End(F )⊗b End(F ). The dual Δ∗ of this map defines\na multiplication on Coend(F ).\nIf C has right duals, the bialgebra Coend(F ) acquires an antipode,\ndefined in the same way as in the finite dimensional case. This antipode\nis invertible if there are also left duals (i.e. if C is rigid). Thus Theorem\n1.23.1 implies the following \"infinite\" extensions of the reconstruction\ntheorems.\nTheorem 1.23.2. The assignments (C, F ) 7→ H = Coend(F ), H 7→\n(H - Comod, Forget) are mutually inverse bijections between\n1) k-linear abelian monoidal categories C with a fiber functor F , up\nto monoidal equivalence and isomorphism of monoidal functors, and\nbialgebras over k, up to isomorphism;\n\n2) k-linear abelian monoidal categories C with right duals with a fiber\nfunctor F , up to monoidal equivalence and isomorphism of monoidal\nfunctors, and bialgebras over k with an antipode, up to isomorphism;\n3) tensor categories C over k with a fiber functor F , up to monoidal\nequivalence and isomorphism of monoidal functors, and Hopf algebras\nover k, up to isomorphism.\nRemark 1.23.3. This theorem allows one to give a categorical proof\nof Proposition 1.22.4, deducing it from the fact that the right dual,\nwhen it exists, is unique up to a unique isomorphism.\nRemark 1.23.4. Corollary 1.22.15 is not true, in general, in the infi\nnite dimensional case: there exist bialgebras H with a non-invertible\nantipode S, see [Ta1]. Therefore, there exist ring categories with sim\nple object 1 and right duals that do not have left duals, i.e., are not\ntensor categories (namely, H - comod).\nIn the next few subsections, we will review some of the most im\nportant basic results about Hopf algebras. For a much more detailed\ntreatment, see the book [Mo].\n1.24. More examples of Hopf algebras. Let us give a few more\nexamples of Hopf algebras. As we have seen, to define a Hopf algebra, it\nsuffices to give an associative unital algebra H, and define a coproduct\non generators of H (this determines a Hopf algebra structure on H\nuniquely if it exists). This is what we'll do in the examples below.\nExample 1.24.1. (Enveloping algebras) Let g be a Lie algebra, and\nlet H = U(g) be the universal enveloping algebra of g. Define the\ncoproduct on H by setting Δ(x) = x ⊗ 1+1 ⊗ x for all x ∈ g. It is easy\nto show that this extends to the whole H, and that H equipped with\nthis Δ is a Hopf algebra. Moreover, it is easy to see that the tensor\ncategory Rep(H) is equivalent to the tensor category Rep(g).\nThis example motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 1.24.2. An element x of a bialgebra H is called primitive\nif Δ(x) = x⊗1+1⊗x. The space of primitive elements of H is denoted\nPrim(H).\nExercise 1.24.3. (i) Show that Prim(H) is a Lie algebra under the\ncommutator.\n(ii) Show that if x is a primitive element then ε(x) = 0, and in\npresence of an antipode S(x) = -x.\nExercise 1.24.4. (i) Let V be a vector space, and SV be the symmet\nric algebra V . Then SV is a Hopf algebra (namely, it is the universal\n\nenveloping algebra of the abelian Lie algebra V ). Show that if k has\ncharacteristic zero, then Prim(SV ) = V .\n(ii) What happens in characteristic p?\nHint. One can restrict to a situation when V is finite dimensional.\nIn this case, regarding elements f ∈ SV as polynomials on V ∗, one can\nshow that f is primitive if and only if it is additive, i.e., f(x + y) =\nf(x) + f(y).\n(iii) Let g be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero. Show\nthat Prim(U(g)) = g.\nHint. Identify U(g) with Sg as coalgebras by using the symmetriza\ntion map.\nExample 1.24.5. (Taft algebras) Let q be a primitive n-th root of\nunity. Let H be the algebra (of dimension n2) generated over k by g\nn\nn\nand x satisfying the following relations: g = 1, x = 0 and gxg-1 = qx.\nDefine the coproduct on H by Δ(g) = g ⊗ g, Δ(x) = x ⊗ g +1 ⊗ x. It is\neasy to show that this extends to a Hopf algebra structure on H. This\nHopf algebra H is called the Taft algebra. For n = 2, one obtains the\nSweedler Hopf algebra of dimension 4. Note that H is not commutative\nor cocommutative, and S2 = 1 on\nH (as S2(x) = qx).\nThis example motivates the following generalization of Definition\n1.24.2.\nDefinition 1.24.6. Let g, h be grouplike elements of a coalgebra H.\nA skew-primitive element of type (h, g) is an element x ∈ H such that\nΔ(x) = h ⊗ x + x ⊗ g.\nRemark 1.24.7. A multiple of h-g is always a skew-primitive element\nof type (h, g). Such a skew-primitive element is called trivial. Note that\nthe element x in Example 1.24.5 is nontrivial.\nExercise 1.24.8. Let x be a skew-primitive element of type h, g in a\nHopf algebra H.\n(i) Show that ε(x) = 0, S(x) = -h-1xg-1 .\n(ii) Show that if a, b ∈ H are grouplike elements, then axb is a skew-\nprimitive element of type (ahb, agb).\nExample 1.24.9. (Nichols Hopf algebras) Let H = C[Z/2Z]n∧(x1, ..., xn),\nwhere the generator g of Z/2Z acts on xi by gxig-1 = -xi. De\nfine the coproduct on H by making g grouplike, and setting Δ(xi) :=\nxi ⊗ g + 1 ⊗ xi (so xi are skew-primitive elements). Then H is a Hopf\nalgebra of dimension 2n+1 . For n = 1, H is the Sweedler Hopf algebra\nfrom the previous example.\n\nExercise 1.24.10. Show that the Hopf algebras of Examples 1.24.1,1.24.5,1.24.9\nare well defined.\nExercise 1.24.11. (Semidirect product Hopf algebras) Let H be a\nHopf algebra, and G a group of automorphisms of H. Let A be the\nsemidirect product k[G] n H. Show that A admits a unique structure\nof a Hopf algebra in which k[G] and H are Hopf subalgebras.\n\n1.25. The Quantum Group Uq (sl2). Let us consider the Lie algebra\nsl2. Recall that there is a basis h, e, f ∈ sl2 such that [h, e] = 2e, [h, f] =\n-2f, [e, f] = h. This motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 1.25.1. Let q ∈ k, q =6\n±1. The quantum group U (sl2) is\nq\ngenerated by elements E, F and an invertible element K with defining\nrelations\nKEK-1 = q 2E, KFK-1 = q-2F, [E, F] = K - K-1\n.\nq - q-1\nTheorem 1.25.2. There exists a unique Hopf algebra structure on\nUq (sl2), given by\n- Δ(K) = K ⊗ K\n(thus K is a grouplike element);\n- Δ(E) = E ⊗ K + 1 ⊗ E;\n- Δ(F) = F ⊗ 1 + K-1 ⊗ F\n(thus E, F are skew-primitive ele\nments).\nExercise 1.25.3. Prove Theorem 1.25.2.\nRemark 1.25.4. Heuristically, K = qh, and thus\nK - K-1\nlim\n= h.\nq\n→\nq - q-1\nSo in the limit q\n1, the relations of Uq (sl2) degenerate into the\n→\nrelations of U(sl2), and thus Uq (sl2) should be viewed as a Hopf algebra\ndeformation of the enveloping algebra U(sl2). In fact, one can make\nthis heuristic idea into a precise statement, see e.g. [K].\nIf q is a root of unity, one can also define a finite dimensional version\nof Uq (sl2). Namely, assume that the order of q is an odd number `. Let\nuq (sl2) be the quotient of Uq (sl2) by the additional relations\nE` = F` = K` - 1 = 0.\nThen it is easy to show that uq (sl2) is a Hopf algebra (with the co\nproduct inherited from Uq (sl2)). This Hopf algebra is called the small\nquantum group attached to sl2.\n1.26. The quantum group Uq (g). The example of the previous sub\nsection can be generalized to the case of any simple Lie algebra. Namely,\nlet g be a simple Lie algebra of rank r, and let A = (aij ) be its Cartan\nmatrix. Recall that there exist unique relatively prime positive integers\ndi, i = 1, . . . r such that diaij = dj aji. Let q ∈ k, q =6\n±1.\nDefinition 1.26.1.\n- The q-analog of n is\nn\nq - q-n\n[n]q =\n.\nq - q-1\n\nX\n- The q-analog of the factorial is\nn\n[n]q ! =\nY\n[l]q = (q - q-1) · · · (qn - q-n) .\n(q - q-1)n\nl=1\nDefinition 1.26.2. The quantum group Uq(g) is generated by elements\nEi, Fi and invertible elements Ki, with defining relations\nKiKj = Kj Ki, KiEj Ki\n-1 = q aij Ej , KiFj Ki\n-1 = q-aij Fj ,\nKdi - K-di\n[Ei, Fj ] = δij\ni\ni\n,\nand the q-Serre relations:\nqdi - q-di\n1-aij\n(1.26.1)\nX\n[l]q ![1\n(\n-\n-\na\n1)\nij\nl\n- l]q ! Ei\n1-aij -lEj Ei\nl = 0, i =6\nj\nl=0\ni\ni\nand\n(1.26.2)\n1-aij\n[l]q ![1\n(\n-\n-\na\n1)\nij\nl\n- l]q ! Fi\n1-aij -lFj Fl\ni = 0, i =6\nj.\nl=0\ni\ni\nMore generally, the same definition can be made for any symmetriz\nable Kac-Moody algebra g.\nTheorem 1.26.3. (see e.g. [CP]) There exists a unique Hopf algebra\nstructure on Uq (g), given by\n- Δ(Ki) = Ki ⊗ Ki;\n- Δ(Ei) = Ei ⊗ Ki + 1 ⊗ Ei;\nΔ(Fi) = Fi ⊗ 1 + Ki\n-1 ⊗ Fi.\n-\nRemark 1.26.4. Similarly to the case of sl2, in the limit q\n1, these\n→\nrelations degenerate into the relations for U(g), so Uq(g) should be\nviewed as a Hopf algebra deformation of the enveloping algebra U(g).\n1.27. Categorical meaning of skew-primitive elements. We have\nseen that many interesting Hopf algebras contain nontrivial skew-primitive\nelements. In fact, the notion of a skew-primitive element has a cate\ngorical meaning. Namely, we have the following proposition.\nProposition 1.27.1. Let g, h be grouplike elements of a coalgebra\nC, and Primh,g(C) be the space of skew-primitive elements of type\nh, g. Then the space Primh,g(H)/k(h - g) is naturally isomorphic to\nExt1(g, h), where g, h are regarded as 1-dimensional right C-comodules.\nProof. Let V be a 2-dimensional H-comodule, such that we have an\nexact sequence\nh\nV\ng\n0.\n→\n→\n→\n→\n\nThen V has a basis v0, v1 such that\nπ(v0) = v0 ⊗ h, π(v1) = v1 ⊗ x + v0 ⊗ g.\nThe condition that this is a comodule yields that x is a skew-primitive\nelement of type (h, g). So any extension defines a skew-primitive el\nement and vice versa. Also, we can change the basis by v0\nv0,\n→\nv1\nv1 + λv0, which modifies x by adding a trivial skew-primitive\n→\nelement. This implies the result.\n\nExample 1.27.2. The category C of finite dimensional comodules over\nuq (sl2) is an example of a finite tensor category in which there are\nobjects V such that V ∗∗ is not isomorphic to V . Namely, in this\ncategory, the functor V 7→ V ∗∗ is defined by the squared antipode\nS2 , which is conjugation by K: S2(x) = KxK-1 . Now, we have\nExt1(K, 1) = Y = hE, F Ki, a 2-dimensional space. The set of iso\nmorphism classes of nontrivial extensions of K by 1 is therefore the\nprojective line PY . The operator of conjugation by K acts on Y with\neigenvalues q2, q-2, hence nontrivially on PY . Thus for a generic ex\ntension V , the object V ∗∗ is not isomorphic to V .\nHowever, note that some power of the functor ∗∗ on C is isomorphic\n(in fact, monoidally) to the identity functor (namely, this power is the\norder of q). We will later show that this property holds in any finite\ntensor category.\nNote also that in the category C, V ∗∗ ∼= V if V is simple. This clearly\nhas to be the case in any tensor category where all simple objects\nare invertible. We will also show (see Proposition 1.41.1 below) that\nthis is the case in any semisimple tensor category. An example of a\ntensor category in which V ∗∗ is not always isomorphic to V even for\nsimple V is the category of finite dimensional representations of the\nthe Yangian H = Y (g) of a simple complex Lie algebra g, see [CP,\n12.1]. Namely, for any finite dimensional representation V of H and\nany complex number z one can define the shifted representation V (z)\n(such that V (0) = V ). Then V ∗∗∼V (2h∨), where h∨ is the dual\n=\nCoxeter number of g, see [CP, p.384]. If V is a non-trivial irreducible\nfinite dimensional representation then V (z) = V for z = 0. Thus,\n∼\n= V . Moreover, we see that the functor ∗∗ has infinite order even\nwhen restricted to simple objects of C.\nHowever, the representation category of the Yangian is infinite, and\nthe answer to the following question is unknown to us.\nV ∗∗ ∼6\nQuestion 1.27.3. Does there exist a finite tensor category, in which\nthere is a simple object V such that V ∗∗ is not isomorphic to V ? (The\nanswer is unknown to the authors).\n\nX\n\nTheorem 1.27.4. Assume that k has characteristic 0. Let C be a finite\nring category over k with simple object 1. Then Ext1(1, 1) = 0.\nProof. Assume the contrary, and suppose that V is a nontrivial exten\nsion of 1 by itself. Let P be the projective cover of 1. Then Hom(P, V )\nis a 2-dimensional space, with a filtration induced by the filtration on\nV , and both quotients naturally isomorphic to E := Hom(P, 1). Let\nv0, v1 be a basis of Hom(P, V ) compatible to the filtration, i.e. v0 spans\nthe 1-dimensional subspace defined by the filtration. Let A = End(P )\n(this is a finite dimensional algebra). Let ε : A\nk be the character\n→\ndefined by the (right) action of A on E. Then the matrix of a ∈ A in\nthe basis v0, v1 has the form\nε(a) χ1(a)\n(1.27.1)\n[a]1 =\nε(a)\nwhere χ1 ∈ A∗ is nonzero. Since a → [a]1 is a homomorphism, χ1 is a\nderivation: χ1(xy) = χ1(x)ε(y) + ε(x)χ1(y).\nNow consider the representation V ⊗ V . Using the exactness of\ntensor products, we see that the space Hom(P, V ⊗V ) is 4-dimensional,\nand has a 3-step filtration, with successive quotients E, E ⊕ E, E, and\nbasis v00; v01, v10; v11, consistent with this filtration. The matrix of\na ∈ End(P ) in this basis is\n⎞\n⎛\n(1.27.2)\n[a]2 =\n⎜\n⎜\n⎝\nε(a) χ1(a) χ1(a) χ2(a)\nε(a)\nχ1(a)\nε(a)\nχ1(a)\nε(a)\n⎟\n⎟\n⎠\nSince a\n[a]2 is a homomorphism, we find\n→\nχ2(ab) = ε(a)χ2(b) + χ2(a)ε(b) + 2χ1(a)χ1(b).\nWe can now proceed further (i.e. consider V ⊗V ⊗V etc.) and define for\nevery positive n, a linear function χn ∈ A∗ which satisfies the equation\nn\nχn(ab) =\nj\nχj (a)χn-j (b),\nj=0\nn\nwhere χ0\nε.\nP\nby φs(a) =\nχm(a)s\n=\nm≥0\npairwise distinct homomorphisms.\nThus for any s ∈ k, we can define φs : A\nk((t))\n→\nmtm/m!, and we find that φs is a family of\nfinite dimensional algebra. We are done.\nThis is a contradiction, as A is a\nCorollary 1.27.5. If a finite ring category C over a field of charac\nteristic zero has a unique simple object 1, then C is equivalent to the\ncategory Vec.\n\nCorollary 1.27.6. A finite dimensional bialgebra H over a field of\ncharacteristic zero cannot contain nonzero primitive elements.\nProof. Apply Theorem 1.27.4 to the category H - comod and use\nProposition 1.27.1.\n\nRemark 1.27.7. Here is a \"linear algebra\" proof of this corollary. Let\nx be a nonzero primitive element of H. Then we have a family of\ngrouplike elements estx ∈ H((t)), s ∈ k, i.e., an infinite collection of\ncharacters of H∗((t)), which is impossible, as H is finite dimensional.\nCorollary 1.27.8. If H is a finite dimensional commutative Hopf\nalgebra over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0, then\nH = Fun(G, k) for a unique finite group G.\nProof. Let G = Spec(H) (a finite group scheme), and x ∈ T1G =\n(m/m2)∗ where m is the kernel of the counit. Then x is a linear function\non m. Extend it to H by setting x(1) = 0. Then x s a derivation:\nx(fg) = x(f)g(1) + f(1)x(g).\nThis implies that x is a primitive element in H∗. So by Corollary\n1.27.6, x = 0. this implies that G is reduced at the point 1. By using\ntranslations, we see that G is reduced at all other points. So G is a\nfinite group, and we are done.\n\nRemark 1.27.9. Theorem 1.27.4 and all its corollaries fail in char\nacteristic p > 0. A counterexample is provided by the Hopf algebra\nk[x]/(xp), where x is a primitive element.\n1.28. Pointed tensor categories and pointed Hopf algebras.\nDefinition 1.28.1. A coalgebra C is pointed if its category of right co\nmodules is pointed, i.e., if any simple right C-comodule is 1-dimensional.\nRemark 1.28.2. A finite dimensional coalgebra C is pointed if and\nonly if the algebra C∗ is basic, i.e., the quotient C∗/Rad(C∗) of C∗ by\nits radical is commutative. In this case, simple C-comodules are points\nof Specm(H∗/Rad(H∗)), which justifies the term \"pointed\".\nDefinition 1.28.3. A tensor category C is pointed if every simple\nobject of C is invertible.\nThus, the category of right comodules over a Hopf algebra H is\npointed if and only if H is pointed.\nExample 1.28.4. The category Vecω is a pointed category. If G is\nG\na p-group and k has characteristic p, then Repk(G) is pointed. Any\ncocommutative Hopf algebra, the Taft and Nichols Hopf algebras, as\nwell as the quantum groups Uq (g) are pointed Hopf algebras.\n\nP\n1.29. The coradical filtration. Let C be a locally finite abelian cat\negory.\nAny object X ∈C has a canonical filtration\n(1.29.1)\n0 = X0 ⊂ X1 ⊂ X2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Xn = X\nsuch that Xi+1/Xi is the socle (i.e., the maximal semisimple subobject)\nof X/Xi (in other words, Xi+1/Xi is the sum of all simple subobjects\nof X/Xi). This filtration is called the socle filtration, or the coradical\nfiltration of X. It is easy to show by induction that the coradical\nfiltration is a filtration of X of the smallest possible length, such that\nthe successive quotients are semisimple. The length of the coradical\nfiltration of X is called the Loewy length of X, and denoted Lw(X).\nThen we have a filtration of the category C by Loewy length of objects:\nC0 ⊂C1 ⊂ ..., where Ci denotes the full subcategory of objects of C of\nLoewy length ≤ i + 1. Clearly, the Loewy length of any subquotient of\nan object X does not exceed the Loewy length of X, so the categories\nCi are closed under taking subquotients.\nDefinition 1.29.1. The filtration of C by Ci is called the coradical\nfiltration of C.\nIf C is endowed with an exact faithful functor F : C → Vec then we\ncan define the coalgebra C = Coend(F ) and its subcoalgebras Ci =\nCoend(F |Ci ), and we have Ci ⊂ Ci+1 and C = ∪iCi (alternatively, we\ncan say that Ci is spanned by matrix elements of C-comodules F (X),\nX ∈Ci). Thus we have defined an increasing filtration by subcoalgebras\nof any coalgebra C. This filtration is called the coradical filtration, and\nthe term C0 is called the coradical of C.\nThe \"linear algebra\" definition of the coradical filtration is as fol\nlows. One says that a coalgebra is simple if it does not have nontrivial\nsubcoalgebras, i.e. if it is finite dimensional, and its dual is a simple\n(i.e., matrix) algebra. Then C0 is the sum of all simple subcoalgebras\nof C. The coalgebras Cn+1 for n ≥ 1 are then defined inductively to\nbe the spaces of those x ∈ C for which\nΔ(x) ∈ Cn ⊗ C + C ⊗ C0.\nExercise 1.29.2. (i) Suppose that C is a finite dimensional coalgebra,\nand I is the Jacobson radical of C∗. Show that Cn\n⊥= In+1 . This\njustifies the term \"coradical filtration\".\n(ii) Show that the coproduct respects the coradical filtration, i.e.\nΔ(Cn) ⊂\ni\nn\n=0 Ci ⊗ Cn-i.\n(iii) Show that C0 is the direct sum of simple subcoalgebras of C.\nIn particular, grouplike elements of any coalgebra C are linearly inde\npendent.\n\nP\nHint. Simple subcoalgebras of C correspond to finite dimensional\nirrreducible representations of C∗.\nDenote by gr(C) the associated graded coalgebra of a coalgebra C\nwith respect to the coradical filtration. Then gr(C) is a Z+-graded\ncoalgebra. It is easy to see from Exercise 1.29.2(i) that the coradical\n\nfiltration of gr(C) is induced by its grading. A graded coalgebra C\nwith this property is said to be coradically graded, and a coalgebra C\n\nsuch that gr(C) = C is called a lifting of C.\nDefinition 1.29.3. A coalgebra C is said to be cosemisimple if C is a\ndirect sum of simple subcoalgebras.\nClearly, C is cosemisimple if and only if C - comod is a semisimple\ncategory.\nProposition 1.29.4. (i) A category C is semisimple if and only if\nC0 = C1.\n(ii) A coalgebra C is cosemisimple if and only if C0 = C1.\nProof. (ii) is a special case of (i), and (i) is clear, since the condition\nmeans that Ext1(X, Y ) = 0 for any simple X, Y , which implies (by\nthe long exact sequence of cohomology) that Ext1(X, Y ) = 0 for all\nX, Y ∈C.\n\nCorollary 1.29.5. (The Taft-Wilson theorem) If C is a pointed coal\ngebra, then C0 is spanned by (linearly independent) grouplike elements\ng, and C1/C0 = ⊕h,gPrimh,g(C)/k(h - g). In particular, any non\ncosemisimple pointed coalgebra contains nontrivial skew-primitive ele\nments.\nProof. The first statement is clear (the linear independence follows from\nExercise 1.29.2(iii). Also, it is clear that any skew-primitive element\nis contained in C1. Now, if x ∈ C1, then x is a matrix element of a\nC-comodule of Loewy length ≤ 2, so it is a sum of matrix elements 2\ndimensional comodules, i.e. of grouplike and skew-primitive elements.\nIt remains to show that the sum\nPrimh,g(C)/k(h - g) ⊂ C/C0\nh,g\nis direct. For this, it suffices to consider the case when C is finite\ndimensional. Passing to the dual algebra A = C∗, we see that the\nstatement is equivalent to the claim that I/I2 (where I is the radical\nof A) is isomorphic (in a natural way) to ⊕g,hExt1(g, h)∗.\nLet pg be a complete system of orthogonal idempotents in A/I2, such\nthat h(pg) = δhg. Define a pairing I/I2 × Ext1(g, h) → k which sends\na ⊗ α to the upper right entry of the 2-by-2 matrix by which a acts\nin the extension of g by h defined by α. It is easy to see that this\n\npairing descends to a pairing B : ph(I/I2)pg × Ext1(g, h) → k. If the\nextension α is nontrivial, the upper right entry cannot be zero, so B is\nright-nondegenerate. Similarly, if a belongs to the left kernel of B, then\na acts by zero in any A-module of Loewy length 2, so a = 0. Thus, B\nis left-nondegenerate. This implies the required isomorphism.\n\nProposition 1.29.6. If C, D are coalgebras, and f : C\nD is a\n→\ncoalgebra homomorphism such that f|C1 is injective, then f is injective.\nProof. One may assume that C and D are finite dimensional. Then\nthe statement can be translated into the following statement about\nfinite dimensional algebras: if A, B are finite dimensional algebras and\nf : A\nB is an algebra homomorphism which descends to a surjective\n→\nhomomorphism A\nB/Rad(B)2, then f is surjective.\n→\nTo prove this statement, let b ∈ B. Let I = Rad(B). We prove by\ninduction in n that there exists a ∈ A such that b - f(a) ∈ In . The\nbase of induction is clear, so we only need to do the step of induction.\nSo assume b ∈ In . We may assume that b = b1...bn, bi ∈ I, and let\nai ∈ A be such that f(ai) = bi modulo I2 . Let a = a1...an. Then\nb - f(a) ∈ In+1, as desired.\n\nCorollary 1.29.7. If H is a Hopf algebra over a field of characteristic\nzero, then the natural map ξ : U(Prim(H))\nH is injective.\n→\nProof. By Proposition 1.29.6, it suffices to check the injectivity of ξ in\ndegree 1 of the coradical filtration. Thus, it is enough to check that\nξ is injective on primitive elements of U(Prim(H)). But by Exercise\n1.24.4, all of them lie in Prim(H), as desired.\n\n1.30. Chevalley's theorem.\nTheorem 1.30.1. (Chevalley) Let k be a field of characteristic zero.\nThen the tensor product of two simple finite dimensional representa\ntions of any group or Lie algebra over k is semisimple.\nProof. Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over a field k (of any\ncharacteristic), and G ⊂ GL(V ) be a Zariski closed subgroup.\nLemma 1.30.2. If V is a completely reducible representation of G,\nthen G is reductive.\nProof. Let V be a nonzero rational representation of an affine algebraic\ngroup G. Let U be the unipotent radical of G. Let V U ⊂ V be the space\nof invariants. Since U is unipotent, V U = 0. So if\nV is irreducible, then\nV U = V , i.e., U acts trivially. Thus, U acts trivially on any completely\nreducible representation of G. So if V is completely reducible and\nG ⊂ GL(V ), then G is reductive.\n\nNow let G be any group, and V, W be two finite dimensional irre\nducible representations of G. Let GV , GW be the Zariski closures of\nthe images of G in GL(V ) and GL(W ), respectively. Then by Lemma\n1.30.2 GV , GW are reductive. Let GV W be the Zariski closure of the\nimage of G in GV × GW . Let U be the unipotent radical of GV W . Let\npV : GV W\nGV , pW : GV W\nGW be the projections. Since pV is\n→\n→\nsurjective, pV (U) is a normal unipotent subgroup of GV , so pV (U) = 1.\nSimilarly, pW (U) = 1. So U = 1, and GV W is reductive.\nLet G0\nV W be the closure of the image of G in GL(V ⊗ W ). Then\nG0\nV W is a quotient of GV W , so it is also reductive. Since chark = 0,\nthis implies that the representation V ⊗ W is completely reducible as\na representation of G0\nV W , hence of G.\nThis proves Chevalley's theorem for groups. The proof for Lie alge\nbras is similar.\n\n1.31. Chevalley property.\nDefinition 1.31.1. A tensor category C is said to have Chevalley prop\nerty if the category C0 of semisimple objects of C is a tensor subcategory.\nThus, Chevalley theorem says that the category of finite dimensional\nrepresentations of any group or Lie algebra over a field of characteristic\nzero has Chevalley property.\nProposition 1.31.2. A pointed tensor category has Chevalley prop\nerty.\nProof. Obvious.\n\nProposition 1.31.3. In a tensor category with Chevalley property,\n(1.31.1)\nLw(X ⊗ Y ) ≤ Lw(X) + Lw(Y ) - 1.\nThus Ci ⊗Cj ⊂Ci+j .\nProof. Let X(i), 0 ≤ i ≤ m, Y (j), 0 ≤ j ≤ n, be the successive\nquotients of the coradical filtrations of X, Y . Then Z := X ⊗ Y has\na filtration with successive quotients Z(r) = ⊕i+j=rX(i) ⊗ Y (j), 0 ≤\nr\nm + n. Because of the Chevalley property, these quotients are\n≤\nsemisimple. This implies the statement.\n\nRemark 1.31.4. It is clear that the converse to Proposition 1.31.3\nholds as well: equation (1.31.3) (for simple X and Y ) implies the\nChevalley property.\nCorollary 1.31.5. In a pointed Hopf algebra H, the coradical filtration\nis a Hopf algebra filtration, i.e. HiHj ⊂ Hi+j and S(Hi) = Hi, so gr(H)\nis a Hopf algebra.\n\nIn this situation, the Hopf algebra H is said to be a lifting of the\ncoradically graded Hopf algebra gr(H).\nExample 1.31.6. The Taft algebra and the Nichols algebras are corad\nically graded. The associated graded Hopf algebra of Uq (g) is the Hopf\nalgebra defined by the same relations as Uq (g), except that the commu\ntation relation between Ei and Fj is replaced with the condition that Ei\nand Fj commute (for all i, j). The same applies to the small quantum\ngroup uq (sl2).\nExercise 1.31.7. Let k be a field of characteristic p, and G a finite\ngroup. Show that the category Repk(G) has Chevalley property if and\nonly if G has a normal p-Sylow subgroup.\n\n1.32. The Andruskiewitsch-Schneider conjecture. It is easy to\nsee that any Hopf algebra generated by grouplike and skew-primitive\nelements is automatically pointed.\nOn the other hand, there exist pointed Hopf algebras which are not\ngenerated by grouplike and skew-primitive elements. Perhaps the sim\nplest example of such a Hopf algebra is the algebra of regular functions\non the Heisenberg group (i.e. the group of upper triangular 3 by 3\nmatrices with ones on the diagonal). It is easy to see that the commu\ntative Hopf algebra H is the polynomial algebra in generators x, y, z\n(entries of the matrix), so that x, y are primitive, and\nΔ(z) = z ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ z + x ⊗ y.\nSince the only grouplike element in H is 1, and the only skew-primitive\nelements are x, y, H is not generated by grouplike and skew-primitive\nelements.\nHowever, one has the following conjecture, due to Andruskiewitsch\nand Schneider.\nConjecture 1.32.1. Any finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebra over\na field of characteristic zero is generated in degree 1 of its coradical\nfiltration, i.e., by grouplike and skew-primitive elements.\nIt is easy to see that it is enough to prove this conjecture for corad\nically graded Hopf algebras; this has been done in many special cases\n(see [AS]).\nThe reason we discuss this conjecture here is that it is essentially a\ncategorical statement. Let us make the following definition.\nDefinition 1.32.2. We say that a tensor category C is tensor-generated\nby a collection of objects Xα if every object of C is a subquotient of a\nfinite direct sum of tensor products of Xα.\nProposition 1.32.3. A pointed Hopf algebra H is generated by grou\nplike and skew-primitive elements if and only if the tensor category\nH - comod is tensor-generated by objects of length 2.\nProof. This follows from the fact that matrix elements of the tensor\nproduct of comodules V, W for H are products of matrix elements of\nV, W .\n\nThus, one may generalize Conjecture 1.32.1 to the following conjec\nture about tensor categories.\nConjecture 1.32.4. Any finite pointed tensor category over a field of\ncharacteristic zero is tensor generated by objects of length 2.\n\nAs we have seen, this property fails for infinite categories, e.g., for\nthe category of rational representations of the Heisenberg group. In\nfact, this is very easy to see categorically: the center of the Heisenberg\ngroup acts trivially on 2-dimensional representations, but it is not true\nfor a general rational representation.\n1.33. The Cartier-Kostant theorem.\nTheorem 1.33.1. Any cocommutative Hopf algebra H over an alge\nbraically closed field of characteristic zero is of the form k[G] n U(g),\nwhere g is a Lie algebra, and G is a group acting on g.\nProof. Let G be the group of grouplike elements of H. Since H is\ncocommutative, it is pointed, and Ext1(g, h) = 0 if g, h ∈ G, g 6= h.\nHence the category C = H-comod splits into a direct sum of blocks C =\n⊕g∈GCg, where Cg is the category of objects of C which have a filtration\nwith successive quotients isomorphic to g. So H = ⊕g∈GHg, where\nCg = Hg -comod, and Hg = gH1. Moreover, A = H1 is a Hopf algebra,\nand we have an action of G on A by Hopf algebra automorphisms.\nNow let g = Prim(A) = Prim(H). This is a Lie algebra, and the\ngroup G acts on it (by conjugation) by Lie algebra automorphisms. So\nwe need just to show that the natural homomorphism ψ : U(g)\nA is\n→\nactually an isomorphism.\nIt is clear that any morphism of coalgebras preserves the coradical\nfiltration, so we can pass to the associated graded morphism ψ0 : Sg →\nA0, where A0 = gr(A). It is enough to check that ψ0 is an isomorphism.\nThe morphism ψ0 is an isomorphism in degrees 0 and 1, and by\nCorollary 1.29.7, it is injective. So we only need to show surjectivity.\nWe prove the surjectivity in each degree n by induction. To simplify\nnotation, let us identify Sg with its image under ψ0. Suppose that the\nsurjectivity is known in all degrees below n. Let z be a homogeneous\nelement in A0 of degree n. Then it is easy to see from the counit axiom\nthat\n(1.33.1)\nΔ(z) - z ⊗ 1 - 1 ⊗ z = u\nwhere u ∈ Sg ⊗ Sg is a symmetric element (as Δ is cocommutative).\nEquation 1.33.1 implies that the element u satisfies the equation\n(1.33.2)\n(Δ ⊗ Id)(u) + u ⊗ 1 = (Id ⊗ Δ)(u) + 1 ⊗ u.\nLemma 1.33.2. Let V be a vector space over a field k of characteristic\nzero. Let u ∈ SV ⊗ SV be a symmetric element satisfying equation\n(1.33.2). Then u = Δ(w) - w ⊗ 1 - 1 ⊗ w for some w ∈ SV .\n\nX\n\nProof. Clearly, we may assume that V is finite dimensional. Regard u\nas a polynomial function on V ∗ × V ∗; our job is to show that\nu(x, y) = w(x + y) - w(x) - w(y)\nfor some polynomial w.\nIf we regard u as a polynomial, equation (1.33.2) takes the form of\nthe 2-cocycle condition\nu(x + y, t) + u(x, y) = u(x, y + t) + u(y, t).\nThus u defines a group law on U := V ∗ ⊕ k, given by\n(x, a) + (y, b) = (x + y, a + b + u(x, y)).\nClearly, we may assume that u is homogeneous, of some degree d = 1.\nSince u is symmetric, the group U is abelian. So in U we have\n((x, 0) + (x, 0)) + ((y, 0) + (y, 0)) = ((x, 0) + (y, 0)) + ((x, 0) + (y, 0))\nComputing the second component of both sides, we get\nu(x, x) + u(y, y) + 2d u(x, y) = 2u(x, y) + u(x + y, x + y).\nSo one can take w(x) = (2d - 2)-1u(x, x), as desired.\n\nNow, applying Lemma 1.33.2, we get that there exists w ∈ A0 such\nthat z - w is a primitive element, which implies that z - w ∈ A0, so\nz ∈ A0.\n\nRemark 1.33.3. The Cartier-Kostant theorem implies that any co\ncommutative Hopf algebra over an algebraically closed field of char\nacteristic zero in which the only grouplike element is 1 is of the form\nU(g), where g is a Lie algebra (a version of the Milnor-Moore theorem),\nin particular is generated by primitive elements. The latter statement\nis false in positive charactersitic. Namely, consider the commutative\nHopf algebra Q[x, z] where x, z are primitive, and set y = z + xp/p,\nwhere p is a prime. Then\np-1 1 p\n(1.33.3)\nΔ(y) = y ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ y +\np i\nx i ⊗ xp-i .\ni=1\nSince the numbers 1\np\np\ni are integers, this formula (together with Δ(x) =\nx ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ x, S(x) = -x, S(y) = -y) defines a Hopf algebra structure\non H = k[x, y] for any field k, in particular, one of characteristic p. But\nif k has characteristic p, then it is easy to see that H is not generated\nby primitive elements (namely, the element y is not in the subalgebra\ngenerated by them).\n\nThe Cartier-Kostant theorem implies that any affine pro-algebraic\ngroup scheme over a field of characteristic zero is in fact a pro-algebraic\ngroup. Namely, we have\nCorollary 1.33.4. Let H be a commutative Hopf algebra over a field\nk of characteristic zero. Then H has no nonzero nilpotent elements.\nProof. It is clear that H is a union of finitely generated Hopf subalge\nbras (generated by finite dimensional subcoalgebras of H), so we may\nassume that H is finitely generated. Let m be the kernel of the counit\nof H, and B = ∪inf\nn=1(H/mn)∗ (i.e., B is the continuous dual of the\nformal completion of H near the ideal m). It is easy to see that B is\na cocommutative Hopf algebra, and its only grouplike element is 1. So\nby the Cartier-Kostant theorem B = U(g), where g = (m/m2)∗. This\nimplies that G = Spec(H) is smooth at 1 ∈ G, i.e. it is an algebraic\ngroup, as desired.\n\nRemark 1.33.5. Note that Corollary 1.33.4 is a generalization of\nCorollary 1.27.6.\n1.34. Quasi-bialgebras. Let us now discuss reconstruction theory for\nquasi-fiber functors. This leads to the notion of quasi-bialgebras and\nquasi-Hopf algebras, which were introduced by Drinfeld in [Dr1] as\nlinear algebraic counterparts of abelian monoidal categories with quasi-\nfiber functors.\nDefinition 1.34.1. Let C be an abelian monoidal category over k,\nand (F, J) : C → Vec be a quasi-fiber functor. (F, J) is said to be\nnormalized if J1X = JX1 = IdF (X) for all X ∈C.\nDefinition 1.34.2. Two quasi-fiber functors (F, J1) and (F, J2) are\nsaid to be twist equivalent (by the twist J1\n-1J2).\nSince for a quasi-fiber functor (unlike a fiber functor), the isomor\nphism J is not required to satisfy any equations, it typically does not\ncarry any valuable structural information, and thus it is more reason\nable to classify quasi-fiber functors not up to isomorphism, but rather\nup to twist equivalence combined with isomorphism.\nRemark 1.34.3. It is easy to show that any quasi-fiber functor is\nequivalent to a normalized one.\nNow let C be a finite abelian monoidal category over k, and let\n(F, J) be a normalized quasi-fiber functor. Let H = End F be the\ncorresponding finite dimensional algebra. Then H has a coproduct Δ\nand a counit ε defined exactly as in the case of a fiber functor, which\nare algebra homomorphisms. The only difference is that, in general,\n\nΔ is not coassociative, since J does not satisfy the monoidal structure\naxiom. Rather, there is an invertible element Φ ∈ H⊗3, defined by the\ncommutative diagram\n(1.34.1)\nΦ F (X),F (Y ),F (Z)\n(F (X) ⊗ F (Y )) ⊗ F (Z) ---------→ F (X) ⊗ (F (Y ) ⊗ F (Z))\n⏐⏐y\n⏐⏐y\nJX,Y ⊗IdF (Z)\nIdF (X)⊗JY,Z\nF (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ F (Z)\nJX⊗Y,Z\n⏐⏐y\n⏐⏐y\nF (X) ⊗ F (Y ⊗ Z)\nJX,Y ⊗Z\nF (aX,Y,Z )\nF ((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z)\n-----→\nF (X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z))\nfor all X, Y, Z ∈C, and we have the following proposition.\nProposition 1.34.4. The following identities hold:\n(1.34.2)\n(Id ⊗ Δ)(Δ(h)) = Φ(Δ ⊗ Id)(Δ(h))Φ-1 ,\nh ∈ H,\n(1.34.3)\n(Id ⊗ Id ⊗ Δ)(Φ)(Δ ⊗ Id ⊗ Id)(Φ) = (1 ⊗ Φ)(Id ⊗ Δ ⊗ Id)(Φ)(Φ ⊗ 1),\n(1.34.4)\n(ε ⊗ Id)(Δ(h)) = h = (Id ⊗ ε)(Δ(h)),\n(1.34.5)\n(Id ⊗ ε ⊗ Id)(Φ) = 1 ⊗ 1.\nProof. The first identity follows from the definition of Φ, the second\none from the pentagon axiom for C, the third one from the condition\nthat (F, J) is normalized, and the fourth one from the triangle axiom\nand the condition that (F, J) is normalized.\n\nDefinition 1.34.5. An associative unital k-algebra H equipped with\nunital algebra homomorphisms Δ : H\nH ⊗ H (the coproduct) and\n→\nε : H → k (the counit) and an invertible element Φ ∈ H⊗3 satisfying\nthe identities of Proposition 1.34.4 is called a quasi-bialgebra. The\nelement Φ is called the associator of H.\nThus, the notion of a quasi-bialgebra is a generalization of the notion\nof a bialgebra; namely, a bialgebra is a quasi-bialgebra with Φ = 1.11\nFor a quasi-bialgebra H, the tensor product of (left) H-modules V\nand W is an H-module via Δ, i.e., in the same way as for bialgebras.\nAlso, it follows from (1.34.2) that for any H-modules U, V, W the map\nping\n(1.34.6)\n= U ⊗(V ⊗W ) : u⊗v⊗w 7→ Φ(u⊗v⊗w)\naU,V,W : (U ⊗V )⊗W ∼\n11However, note that Δ can be coassociative even if Φ = 1.\n\nX\nis an H-module isomorphism. The axiom (1.34.4) implies that the\nnatural maps lV = Id : 1 ⊗ V\n∼V and rV = Id : V ⊗ 1\n∼V are also\n-→\n-→\nH-module isomorphisms. Finally, equations (1.34.3) and (1.34.5) say,\nrespectively, that the pentagon axiom (1.1.2) and the triangle axiom\n(1.2.1) are satisfied for Rep(H). In other words, Rep(H) is a monoidal\ncategory.\nDefinition 1.34.6. A twist for a quasi-bialgebra H is an invertible\nelement J ∈ H ⊗ H such that (ε ⊗ Id)(J) = (Id ⊗ ε)(J) = 1. Given a\ntwist, we can define a new quasi-bialgebra HJ which is H as an algebra,\nwith the same counit, the coproduct given by\nΔJ (x) = J-1Δ(x)J,\nand the associator given by\nΦJ = (Id ⊗ J)-1(Id ⊗ Δ)(J)-1Φ(Δ ⊗ Id)(J)(J ⊗ Id)\nThe algebra HJ is called twist equivalent to H, by the twist J.\nIt is easy to see that twist equivalent quasi-fiber functors produce\ntwist-equivalent quasi-bialgebras, and vice versa. Also, we have the\nfollowing proposition.\nProposition 1.34.7. If a finite k-linear abelian monoidal category C\nadmits a quasi-fiber functor, then this functor is unique up to twisting.\nProof. Let Xi, i = 1, ..., n be the simple objects of C. The functor\nF is exact, so it is determined up to isomorphism by the numbers\ndi = dim F (Xi). So our job is to show that these numbers are uniquely\ndetermined by C.\nLet Ni = (Nij\nk ) be the matrix of left multiplication by Xi in the\nGrothendieck ring of C in the basis {Xj }, i.e.\nXiXj =\nNij\nk Xk\n(so, k labels the rows and j labels the columns of Ni).\nWe claim that di is the spectral radius of Ni. Indeed, on the one\nhand, we have\nX\nNij\nmdm = didj ,\nso di is an eigenvalue of Ni\nT , hence of Ni. On the other hand, if ej is the\nstandard basis of Zn then for any r ≥ 0 the sum of the coordinates of\nthe vector Ni\nrej is the length of the object X⊗r ⊗Xj , so it is dominated\ni\nby dr\ni dj. This implies that the spectral radius of Ni is at most di. This\nmeans that the spectral radius is exactly di, as desired.\n\nTherefore, we have the following reconstruction theorem.\n\nX\nX\nP\nX\nX\nTheorem 1.34.8. The assignments (C, F ) 7→ H = End(F ), H 7→\n(Rep(H), Forget) are mutually inverse bijections between\n1) finite k-linear abelian monoidal categories C admitting a quasi-\nfiber functor, up to monoidal equivalence of categories.\n2) finite dimensional quasi-bialgebras H over k up to twist equiva\nlence and isomorphism.\nProof. Straightforward from the above.\n\nExercise 1.34.9. Suppose that in the situation of Exercise 1.21.6, the\nfunctor F is equipped with a quasi-monoidal structure J, i.e. an iso\nmorphism J : F ( ) ⊗ F ( )\nF (- ⊗-), such that J1X = JX1 = IdF (X).\n-\n- →\nShow that this endows H with the structure of a quasi-bialgebra, such\nthat (F, J) defines a monoidal equivalence C → Rep(H).\nRemark 1.34.10. Proposition 1.34.7 is false for infinite categories.\nFor example, it is known that if C = Rep(SL2(C)), and V ∈C is a 2\ndimensional repesentation, then there exists a for any positive integer\nn ≥ 2 there exists a fiber functor on C with dim F (V ) = n (see [Bi]).\n1.35. Quasi-bialgebras with an antipode and quasi-Hopf alge\nbras. Now consider the situation of the previous subsection, and as\nsume that the category C has right duals. In this case, by Proposition\n1.13.5, the right dualization functor is exact; it is also faithful by Propo\nsition 1.10.9. Therefore, the functor F (V ∗)∗ is another quasi-fiber func\ntor on C. So by Proposition 1.34.7, this functor is isomorphic to F . Let\nus fix such an isomorphism ξ = (ξV ), ξV : F (V )\nF (V ∗)∗. Then we\n→\nhave natural linear maps k → F (V ) ⊗ F (V ∗), F (V ∗) ⊗ F (V ) → k con\nstructed as in Exercise 1.10.6, which can be regarded as linear maps\nαˆ : F (V )\nF (V ∗)∗ and βˆ : F (V ∗)∗\nF (V ). Thus, the quasi\n→\n→\nbialgebra H = End(F ) has the following additional structures.\n1. The elements α, β ∈ H such that for any V ∈C, αV = ξ-1\nαˆV ,\nV\nβV = βˆV * ξV . Note that α and β are not necessarily invertible.\n*\n2. The antipode S : H\nH, which is a unital algebra antihomo\n→ P\nmorphism such that if Δ(a) =\ni ai\n1 ⊗ ai\n2 , a ∈ H, then\n(1.35.1)\nS(a 1\ni )αa2\ni = ε(a)α,\na 1\ni βS(a 2\ni ) = ε(a)β.\ni\ni\nNamely, for a ∈ H S(a) acts on F (V ) by ξ-1 * a∗\nξ.\nP\nF (V ∗) *\nLet us write the associator as Φ =\ni Φ1\ni ⊗ Φi\n2 ⊗ Φ3\ni and its inverse\nas\nΦ 1\ni ⊗ Φ 2\ni ⊗ Φ 3\ni .\nProposition 1.35.1. One has\n(1.35.2)\nΦ1\ni βS(Φi\n2)αΦ3\ni = 1,\nS(Φ 1\ni )αΦ 2\ni βS(Φ 3\ni ) = 1.\n\nP\nX\nProof. This follows directly from the duality axioms.\n\nDefinition 1.35.2. An antipode on a quasi-bialgebra H is a triple\n(S, α, β), where S : H\nH is a unital antihomomorphism and α, β ∈\n→\nH, satisfying identities (1.35.1) and (1.35.2).\nA quasi-Hopf algebra is a quasi-bialgebra (H, Δ, ε, Φ) for which there\nexists an antipode (S, α, β) such that S is bijective.\nThus, the notion of a quasi-Hopf algebra is a generalization of the\nnotion of a Hopf algebra; namely, a Hopf algebra is a quasi-Hopf algebra\nwith Φ = 1, α = β = 1.\nWe see that if in the above setting C has right duals, then H =\nEnd(F ) is a finite dimensional bialgebra admitting antipode, and if C\nis rigid (i.e., a tensor category), then H is a quasi-Hopf algebra.\nConversely, if H is a quasi-bialgebra with an antipode, then the\ncategory C = Rep(H) admits right duals. Indeed, the right dual module\nof an H-module V is defined as in the Hopf algebra case: it is the dual\nvector space V ∗ with the action of H given by\nh hφ, v i = h φ, S(h)v i,\nv ∈ V, φ ∈ V ∗, h ∈ H.\nLet\nvi ⊗ fi be the image of IdV under the canonical isomorphism\nEnd(V )\n∼\nThen the evaluation and coevaluation maps are\n-→ V ⊗ V ∗.\ndefined using the elements α and β:\nevV (f ⊗ v) = f(αv), coevV (1) =\nβvi ⊗ fi.\nAxiom (1.35.1) is then equivalent to evV and coevV being H-module\nmaps. Equations (1.35.2) are equivalent, respectively, to axioms (1.10.1)\nand (1.10.2) of a right dual.\nIf S is invertible, then the right dualization functor is an equivalence\nof categories, so the representation category Rep(H) of a quasi-Hopf\nalgebra H is rigid, i.e., a tensor category.\nExercise 1.35.3. Let H := (H, Δ, ε, Φ, S, α, β) be a quasi-bialgebra\nwith an antipode, and u ∈ H be an invertible element.\n(i) Show that if one sets\n(1.35.3)\nS(h) = uS(h)u-1 ,\nα = uα,\nand\nβ = βu-1\nthen the triple (S, α, β) is an antipode.\n(ii) Conversely, show that any S, α, and β satisfying conditions\n(1.35.1) and (1.35.2) are given by formulas (1.35.3) for a uniquely de\nfined u.\nHint. If H is finite dimensional, (ii) can be formally deduced from\nthe uniqueness of the right dual in a tensor category up to a unique\n\nX\nX\nisomorphism. Use this approach to obtain the unique possible formula\nfor u, and check that it does the job for any H.\nRemark 1.35.4. The non-uniqueness of S, α, and β observed in Ex\nercise 1.35.3 reflects the freedom in choosing the isomorphism ξ.\nExample 1.35.5. (cf. Example 1.10.14) Let G be a finite group and\nlet ω ∈ Z3(G, k×) be a normalized 3-cocycle, see (1.3.1). Consider\nthe algebra H = Fun(G, k) of k-valued functions on G with the usual\ncoproduct and counit. Set\nΦ =\nω(f, g, h)pf ⊗ pg ⊗ ph,\nα =\nω(g, g-1 , g)pg,\nβ = 1,\nwhere pg is the primitive idempotent of H corresponding to g ∈ G.\nIt is straightforward to check that these data define a commutative\nquasi-Hopf algebra, which we denote Fun(G, k)ω. The tensor category\nRep(Fun(G, k)ω) is obviously equivalent to Vecω\nG.\nIt is easy to show that a twist of a quasi-bialgebra H with an antipode\nis again a quasi-bialgebra with an antipode (this reflects the fact that\nin the finite dimensional case, the existence of an antipode for H is the\nproperty of the category of finite dimensional representations of H).\nIndeed, if the twist J and its inverse have the form\nX\nX\nJ =\nai ⊗ bi, J-1 =\na0\ni ⊗ b0\ni\ni\ni\nP\nthen HJ has an antipode (SJ , αJ , βJ ) with SJ = S and αJ\nP\n=\ni S(ai)αbi,\nβJ =\ni a0\niβS(b0\ni). Thus, we have the following reconstruction theorem.\nTheorem 1.35.6. The assignments (C, F ) 7→ H = End(F ), H 7→\n(Rep(H), Forget) are mutually inverse bijections between\n(i) finite abelian k-linear monoidal categories C with right duals ad\nmitting a quasi-fiber functor, up to monoidal equivalence of categories,\nand finite dimensional quasi-bialgebras H over k with an antipode, up\nto twist equivalence and isomorphism;\n(ii) finite tensor categories C admitting a quasi-fiber functor, up to\nmonoidal equivalence of categories, and finite dimensional quasi-Hopf\nalgebras H over k, up to twist equivalence and isomorphism.\nRemark 1.35.7. One can define the dual notions of a coquasi-bialgebra\nand coquasi-Hopf algebra, and prove the corresponding reconstruction\ntheorems for tensor categories which are not necessarily finite. This is\nstraightforward, but fairly tedious, and we will not do it here.\n\nP\nP\nP\n1.36. Twists for bialgebras and Hopf algebras. Let H be a bial\ngebra. We can regard it as a quasi-bialgebra with Φ = 1. Let J be a\ntwist for H.\nDefinition 1.36.1. J is called a bialgebra twist if HJ is a bialgebra,\ni.e. ΦJ = 1.\nThus, a bialgebra twist for H is an invertible element J ∈ H ⊗H such\nthat (ε ⊗ Id)(J) = (Id ⊗ ε)(J) = 1, and J satisfies the twist equation\n(1.36.1)\n(Id ⊗ Δ)(J)(Id ⊗ J) = (Δ ⊗ Id)(J)(J ⊗ Id).\nExercise 1.36.2. Show that if a bialgebra H has an antipode S, and J\nis a bialgebra twist for H, then the bialgebra HJ also has an antipode.\nNamely, let J =\nai ⊗ bi, J-1 =\na0\ni ⊗ b0\ni, and set QJ =\nS(ai)bi.\nP\ni\nThen QJ is invertible with Q-\nJ\n1 =\ni a0\niS(b0\ni), and the antipode of HJ\nis defined by SJ (x) = QJ\n-1S(x)QJ . In particular, a bialgebra twist of\na Hopf algebra is again a Hopf algebra.\nRemark 1.36.3. Twisting does not change the category of H-modules\nas a monoidal category, and the existence of an antipode (for finite\ndimensional H) is a categorical property (existence of right duals).\nThis yields the above formulas, and then one easily checks that they\nwork for any H.\nAny twist on a bialgebra H defines a fiber functor (Id, J) on the\ncategory Rep(H). However, two different twists J1, J2 may define iso\nmorphic fiber functors. It is easy to see that this happens if there is an\ninvertible element v ∈ H such that\nJ2 = Δ(v)J1(v-1 ⊗ v-1).\nIn this case the twists J1 and J2 are called gauge equivalent by the\ngauge transformation v, and the bialgebras HJ1 , HJ2 are isomorphic\n(by conjugation by v). So, we have the following result.\nProposition 1.36.4. Let H be a finite dimensional bialgebra. Then\nJ 7→ (Id, J) is a bijection between:\n1) gauge equivalence classes of bialgebra twists for H, and\n2) fiber functors on C = Rep(H), up to isomorphism.\nProof. By Proposition 1.34.7, any fiber functor on C is isomorphic to\nthe forgetful functor F as an additive functor. So any fiber functor, up\nto an isomorphism, has the form (F, J), where J is a bialgebra twist.\nNow it remains to determine when (F, J1) and (F, J2) are isomorphic.\nLet v : (F, J1) → (F, J2) be an isomorphism. Then v ∈ H is an\ninvertible element, and it defines a gauge transformation mapping J1\nto J2.\n\nProposition 1.36.5. Let G be a group. Then fiber functors on VecG\nup to an isomorphism bijectively correspond to H2(G, k×).\nProof. A monoidal structure on the forgetful functor F is given by a\nfunction J(g, h) : δg ⊗ δh → δg ⊗ δh, J(g, h) ∈ k×. It is easy to see that\nthe monoidal structure condition is the condition that J is a 2-cocycle,\nand two 2-cocycles define isomorphic monoidal structures if and only\nif they differ by a coboundary. Thus, equivalence classes of monoidal\nstructures on F are parametrized by H2(G, k×), as desired.\n\nRemark 1.36.6. Proposition 1.36.5 shows that there may exist non-\nisomorphic fiber functors on a given finite tensor category C defining\nisomorphic Hopf algebras. Indeed, all fiber functors on VecG yield the\nsame Hopf algebra Fun(G, k). These fiber functors are, however, all\nequivalent to each other by monoidal autoequivalences of C.\nRemark 1.36.7. Since Vecω does not admit fiber functors for cohomo-\nG\nlogically nontrivial ω, Proposition 1.36.5 in fact classifies fiber functors\non all categories Vecω\nG.\n\n1.37. Quantum traces. Let C be a rigid monoidal category, V be an\nobject in C, and a ∈ Hom(V, V ∗∗). Define the left quantum trace\n(1.37.1)\nTrL (a) := evV ∗ * (a ⊗ IdV ∗ ) * coevV ∈ End(1).\nV\nSimilarly, if a ∈ Hom(V, ∗∗V ) then we can define the right quantum\ntrace\n(1.37.2)\nTrR (a) := ev∗∗V * (Id∗V ⊗ a) * coev∗V ∈ End(1).\nV\nIn a tensor category over k, TrL(a) and TrR(a) can be regarded as\nelements of k.\nWhen no confusion is possible, we will denote TrL\nV by TrV .\nThe following proposition shows that usual linear algebra formulas\nhold for the quantum trace.\nProposition 1.37.1. If a ∈ Hom(V, V ∗∗), b ∈ Hom(W, W ∗∗) then\n(1) TrV\nL (a) = TrV\nR\n∗ (a∗);\n(2) TrV\nL\n⊕W (a ⊕ b) = TrL\nW (b) (in additive categories);\nV (a) + TrL\n(3) TrV\nL\n⊗W (a ⊗ b) = TrL (a)TrL (b);\nV\nW\n(4) If c ∈ Hom(V, V ) then TrL (ac) = TrL (c∗∗a), TrR (ac) = TrR(∗∗ca).\nV\nV\nV\nV\nSimilar equalities to (2),(3) also hold for right quantum traces.\nExercise 1.37.2. Prove Proposition 1.37.1.\nIf C is a multitensor category, it is useful to generalize Proposi\ntion 1.37.1(2) as follows.\nProposition 1.37.3. If a\nHom(V, V ∗∗) and W\nV such that\n∈\n⊂\na(W ) ⊂ W ∗∗ then TrL\n= TrL\nV/W (a). That is, Tr is addi-\nV (a)\nW (a) + TrL\ntive on exact sequences. The same statement holds for right quantum\ntraces.\nExercise 1.37.4. Prove Proposition 1.37.3.\n1.38. Pivotal categories and dimensions.\nDefinition 1.38.1. Let C be a rigid monoidal category. A pivotal\nstructure on C is an isomorphism of monoidal functors a : Id\n∼?∗∗.\n-→\nThat is, a pivotal structure is a collection of morphisms aX : X\n∼-→\nX∗∗ natural in X and satisfying aX⊗Y = aX ⊗ aY for all objects X, Y\nin C.\nDefinition 1.38.2. A rigid monoidal category C equipped with a piv\notal structure is said to be pivotal.\nExercise 1.38.3.\n(1) If a is a pivotal structure then aV ∗ = (aV )∗-1 .\nHence, aV ∗∗ = a∗∗\nV .\n\n(2) Let C = Rep(H), where H is a finite dimensional Hopf alge\nbra. Show that pivotal structures on C bijectively correspond\nto group-like elements of H such that gxg-1 = S2(x) for all\nx ∈ H.\nLet a be a pivotal structure on a rigid monoidal category C.\nDefinition 1.38.4. The dimension of an object X with respect to a\nis dima(X) := Tr(aX ) ∈ End(1).\nThus, in a tensor category over k, dimensions are elements of k. Also,\nit follows from Exercise 1.38.3 that dima(V ) = dima(V ∗∗).\nProposition 1.38.5. If C is a tensor category, then the function X 7→\ndima(X) is a character of the Grothendieck ring Gr(C).\nProof. Proposition 1.37.3 implies that dima is additive on exact se\nquences, which means that it gives rise to a well-defined linear map\nfrom Gr(C) to k. The fact that this map is a character follows from the\nobvious fact that dima(1) = 1 and Proposition 1.37.1(3).\n\nCorollary 1.38.6. Dimensions of objects in a pivotal finite tensor cat\negory are algebraic integers in k. 12\nProof. This follows from the fact that a character of any ring that is\nfinitely generated as a Z-module takes values in algebraic integers.\n1.39. Spherical categories.\nDefinition 1.39.1. A pivotal structure a on a tensor category C is\nspherical if dima(V ) = dima(V ∗) for any object V in C. A tensor\ncategory is spherical if it is equipped with a spherical structure.\nSince dima is additive on exact sequences, it suffices to require the\nproperty dima(V ) = dima(V ∗) only for simple objects V .\nTheorem 1.39.2. Let C be a spherical category and V be an object of\nThen for any x ∈ Hom(V, V ) one has TrL (aV x) = TrR (xa-1).\nC.\nV\nV\nV\nProof. We first note that TrR (a-1) = dima(X∗) for any object X by\nX\nX\nProposition 1.37.1(1) and Exercise 1.38.3(1). Now let us prove the\nproposition in the special case when V is semisimple. Thus V = ⊕i Yi ⊗\nVi, where Vi are vector spaces and Yi are simple objects. Then x =\n12If k has positive characteristic, by an algebraic integer in k we mean an element\nof a finite subfield of k.\n\nX\nX\n\n⊕i xi ⊗IdVi with xi ∈ Endk(Yi) and a = ⊕ IdYi ⊗aVi (by the functoriality\nof a). Hence\nTrL\nV (ax) =\nTr(xi) dim(Vi),\nTrR\nV (xa-1) =\nTr(xi) dim(Vi\n∗).\nThis implies the result for a semisimple V .\nConsider now the general case. Then V has the coradical filtration\n(1.39.1)\n0 = V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Vn = V\n(such that Vi+1/Vi is a maximal semisimple subobject in V/Vi). This\nfiltration is preserved by x and by a (i.e., a : Vi\nVi\n∗∗). Since traces\n→\nare additive on exact sequences by Proposition 1.37.3, this implies that\nthe general case of the required statement follows from the semisimple\ncase.\n\nExercise 1.39.3. (i) Let Aut⊗(IdC) be the group of isomorphism classes\nof monoidal automorphisms of a monoidal category C. Show that the\nset of isomorphism classes of pivotal structures on C is a torsor over\nAut⊗(IdC), and the set of isomorphism classes of spherical structures\non C is a torsor over the subgroup Aut⊗(IdC)2 in Aut⊗(IdC ) of elements\nwhich act by ±1 on simple objects.\n1.40. Semisimple multitensor categories. In this section we will\nmore closely consider semisimple multitensor categories which have\nsome important additional properties compared to the general case.\n1.41. Isomorphism between V ∗∗ and V .\nProposition 1.41.1. Let C be a semisimple multitensor category and\nlet V be an object in C.\n= V ∗.\n= V ∗∗.\nThen ∗V ∼\nHence, V ∼\nProof. We may assume that V is simple.\nWe claim that the unique simple object X such that Hom(1, V ⊗X) =6\n0 is V ∗. Indeed, Hom(1, V ⊗ X) ∼Hom(∗X, V ) which is non-zero if\n=\nand only if ∗X ∼\n= V ∗.\n= V , i.e., X ∼\nSimilarly, the unique simple object\nX such that Hom(V ⊗ X, 1) =6\n0 is ∗V . But since C is semisimple,\ndimk Hom(1, V ⊗ X) = dimk Hom(V ⊗ X, 1), which implies the result.\nRemark 1.41.2. As noted in Remark 1.27.2, the result of Proposi\ntion 1.41.1 is false for non-semisimple categories.\nRemark 1.41.3. Proposition 1.41.1 gives rise to the following ques\ntion.\n\nP\nP\nP\n\nQuestion 1.41.4. Does any semisimple tensor category admit a piv\notal structure? A spherical structure?\nThis is the case for all known examples. The general answer is un\nknown to us at the moment of writing (even for ground fields of char\nacteristic zero).\nProposition 1.41.5. If C is a semisimple tensor category and a : V\n∼-→\nV ∗∗ for a simple object V then Tr(a) = 0.\nProof. Tr(a) is the composition morphism of the diagram 1\nV ⊗\n→\nV ∗\n1 where both morphisms are non-zero. If the composition mor\n→\nphism is zero then there is a non-zero morphism (V ⊗V ∗)/1 → 1 which\nmeans that the [V ⊗ V ∗ : 1] ≥ 2. Since C is semisimple, this implies\nthat dimk Hom(1, V ⊗ V ∗) is at least 2. Hence, dimk Hom(V, V ) ≥ 2\nwhich contradicts the simplicity of V .\n\nRemark 1.41.6. The above result is false for non-semisimple cate\ngories. For example, let C = Repk(GLp(Fp)), the representation cat\negory of the group GLp(Fp) over a field k of characteristic p. Let\nV be the p dimensional vector representation of GLp(Fp) (which is\nclearly irreducible). Let a : V\nV ∗∗ be the identity map. Then\n→\nTr(a) = dimk(V ) = p = 0 in k.\n1.42. Grothendieck rings of semisimple tensor categories.\nDefinition 1.42.1.

If C is a semisimple multitensor category then\nGr(C) is a based ring. If C is semisimple tensor category then Gr(C) is\na unital based ring. If C is a (multi)fusion category, then Gr(C) is a\n(multi)fusion ring.\nProof. The Z+-basis in Gr(C) consists of isomorphism classes of simple\nobjects of C. The set I0 consists of the classes of simple subobjects of\n1. The involution ∗ is the duality map (by Proposition 1.41.1 it does\nnot matter whether to use left or right duality). This implies the first\ntwo statements. The last statement is clear.\n\nExample 1.42.5. Let C be the category of finite dimensional repre\nsentations of the Lie algebra sl2(C). Then the simple objects of this\ncategory are irreducible representations Vm of dimension m + 1 for\nm = 0, 1, 2, . . . ; V0 = 1. The Grothendieck ring of C is determined by\nthe well-known Clebsch-Gordon rule\ni+j\n(1.42.3)\nVi ⊗ Vj =\nVl.\nl=|i-j|,i+j-l∈2Z\nThe duality map on this ring is the identity. The same is true if C =\nRep(Uq (sl2)) when q is not a root of unity, see [K].\nLet C be a semisimple multitensor category with simple objects\n{Xi}i∈I . Let I0 be the subset of I such that 1 = ⊕i∈I0 Xi. Let\nHij\nl := Hom(Xl, Xi ⊗ Xj ) (if Xp ∈Cij with p ∈ I and i, j ∈ I0, we\nwill identify spaces Hp and Hp with k using the left and right unit\npi\nip\nmorphisms).\nL\nWe have Xi ⊗ Xj =\nl Hij\nl ⊗ Xl. Hence,\n(Xi1\n=\nHj\n⊗ Hi4\n⊗ Xi2 ) ⊗ Xi3 ∼\ni1i2\nji3 ⊗ Xi4\ni4\nj\nXi1 ⊗ (Xi2\n)\n=\nHi\ni\nl ⊗ Hl\n.\n⊗ Xi3\n∼\ni2i3 ⊗ Xi4\ni4\nl\n\nM\nM\nThus the associativity constraint reduces to a collection of linear iso\nmorphisms\n(1.42.4)\nΦi4\n:\nHj\n⊗ Hi4 =\nHi4\n.\ni1i2i3\ni1i2\nji3 ∼\ni1l ⊗ Hi\nl\n2i3\nj\nl\nThe matrix blocks of these isomorphisms,\n(1.42.5)\n(Φi4\n)jl : Hj\n⊗ Hi4\nHi\ni\nl ⊗ Hl\ni1i2i3\ni1i2\nji3 →\ni2i3\nare called 6j-symbols because they depend on six indices.\nExample 1.42.6. Let C be the category of finite dimensional repre\nsentations of the Lie algebra sl2(C). Then the spaces Hij\nl are 0- or\n1-dimensional. In fact, it is obvious from the Clebsch-Gordan rule that\nthe map (Φi\ni\n1i2i3 )jl is a map between nonzero (i.e., 1-dimensional) spaces\nif and only if the numbers i1, i2, i3, i4, j, l are edge lengths of a tetrahe\ndron with faces corresponding to the four H-spaces (i1i2j, ji3i4,i1li4,\ni2i3l, such that the perimeter of every face is even (this tetrahedron\nis allowed to be in the Euclidean 3-space, Euclidean plane, or hyper\nbolic 3-space, so the only conditions are the triangle inequalities on\nthe faces). In this case, the 6j-symbol can be regarded as a number,\nprovided we choose a basis vector in every non-zero Hij\nl . Under an ap\npropriate normalization of basis vectors these numbers are the Racah\ncoefficients or classical 6j-symbols. More generally, if C = Uq (sl2),\nwhere q is not a root of unity, then the numbers (Φi\ni\n1i2i3 )jl are called\nq-Racah coefficients or quantum 6j-symbols [CFS].\nFurther, the evaluation and coevaluation maps define elements\n(1.42.6)\nαij ∈ (Hii\nj\n∗ )∗\nand\nβij ∈ Hii\nj\n∗ , j ∈ I0.\nNow the axioms of a rigid monoidal category, i.e., the triangle and\npentagon identities and the rigidity axioms translate into non-linear al\ngebraic equations with respect to the 6j-symbols (Φi\ni\n1i2i3 )jl and vectors\nαij , βij .\nExercise 1.42.7. Write down explicitly the relation on 6j symbols\ncoming from the pentagon identity. If C = Rep(sl2(C)) this relation is\ncalled the Elliott-Biedenharn relation ([CFS]).\nProposition 1.42.4 gives rise to the following general problem of cat\negorification of based rings which is one of the main problems in the\nstructure theory of tensor categories.\nProblem 1.42.8. Given a based ring R, describe (up to equivalence)\nall multitensor categories over k whose Grothendieck ring is isomorphic\nto R.\n\nIt is clear from the above explanations that this problem is equiva\nlent to finding all solutions of the system of algebraic equations coming\nfrom the axioms of the rigid monoidal category modulo the group of au\ntomorphisms of the spaces Hij\nk (\"gauge transformations\"). In general,\nthis problem is very difficult because the system of equations involved\nis nonlinear, contains many unknowns and is usually over-determined.\nIn particular, it is not clear a priori whether for a given R this sys\ntem has at least one solution, and if it does, whether the set of these\nsolutions is finite. It is therefore amazing that the theory of tensor\ncategories allows one to solve the categorification problem in a number\nof nontrivial cases. This will be done in later parts of these notes; now\nwe will only mention the simplest result in this direction, which follows\nfrom the results of Subsection 1.7.\nLet Z[G] be the group ring of a group G, with basis {g ∈ G} and\ninvolution g∗ = g-1 . Clearly, Z[G] is a unital based ring.\nProposition 1.42.9. The categorifications of Z[G] are Vecω\nG, and they\nare parametrized by H3(G, k×)/Out(G).\nRemark 1.42.10. It is tempting to say that any Z+-ring R has a\ncanonical categorification over any field k: one can take the skeletal\nsemisimple category C = CR over k whose Grothendieck group is R,\ndefine the tensor product functor on C according to the multiplication\nin R, and then \"define\" the associativity isomorphism to be the identity\n(which appears to make sense because the category is skeletal, and\ntherefore by the associativity of R one has (X ⊗Y )⊗Z = X ⊗(Y ⊗Z)).\nHowever, a more careful consideration shows that this approach does\nnot actually work. Namely, such \"associativity isomorphism\" fails to\nbe functorial with respect to morphisms; in other words, if g : Y\nY is\n→\na morphism, then (IdX ⊗g)⊗IdZ is not always equal to IdX ⊗(g ⊗IdZ ).\nTo demonstrate this explicitly, denote the simple objects of the cat\negory C by Xi, i = 1, ..., r, and let Xi ⊗ Xj = ⊕kNij\nl Xl. Take X = Xi,\nY = mXj , and Z = Xl; then g is an m by m matrix over k. The alge\nbra End((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z) = End(X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)) is equal to ⊕sMatmns (k),\nwhere\nX\nX\nns =\nNij\np Npl\ns =\nNiq\ns Njl\nq ,\np\nq\nand in this algebra we have\n(IdX ⊗ g) ⊗ IdZ = ⊕p\nr\n=1IdN p ⊗ g ⊗ IdNs ,\nij\npl\nIdX ⊗ (g ⊗ IdZ ) = ⊕r\nIdNs\n,\nq=1\niq ⊗ g ⊗ IdN q\njl\nWe see that these two matrices are, in general, different, which shows\nthat the identity \"associativity isomorphism\" is not functorial.\n\nP\nY\n1.43. Semisimplicity of multifusion rings.\nDefinition 1.43.1. A ∗-algebra is an associative algebra B over C\nwith an antilinear anti-involution ∗ : B\nB and a linear functional\n→\nτ : B\nC such that τ(ab) = τ(ba), and the Hermitian form τ(ab∗) is\n→\npositive definite.\nObviously, any semisimple algebra B = ⊕r Mati(C) is a ∗-algebra.\ni=1\nNamely, if pi > 0 are any positive numbers for i = 1, ..., r then one\ncan define ∗ to be the usual hermitian adjoint of matrices, and set\nτ(a1, ..., ar) =\ni piTr(ai). Conversely, it is easy to see that any 8\nalgebra structure on a finite dimensional semisimple algebra has this\nform up to an isomorphism (and the numbers pi are uniquely deter\nmined, as traces of central idempotents of B).\nIt turns out that this is the most general example of a finite dimen\nsional ∗-algebra. Namely, we have\nProposition 1.43.2. Any finite dimensional ∗-algebra B is semisim\nple.\nProof. If M ⊂ B is a subbimodule, and M ⊥ is the orthogonal comple\nment of M under the form τ(ab∗), then M ⊥ is a subbimodule of B,\nand M ∩ M ⊥ = 0 because of the positivity of the form. So we have\nB = M ⊕ M ⊥. Thus B is a semisimple B-bimodule, which implies the\nproposition.\n\nCorollary 1.43.3. If e is a nonzero idempotent in a finite dimensional\n∗-algebra B then τ(e) > 0.\nThe following proposition is obvious.\nProposition 1.43.4. Let A be a based ring. Then the algebra A ⊗Z C\nis canonically a ∗-algebra.\nCorollary 1.43.5. Let A be a multifusion ring. Then the algebra\nA ⊗Z C is semsimiple.\nCorollary 1.43.6. Let X be a basis element of a fusion ring A. Then\nthere exists n > 0 such that τ(Xn) > 0.\nProof. Since τ(Xn(X∗)n) > 0 for all n > 0, X is not nilpotent. Let\nr\nq(x) :=\n(x - ai)mi\ni=0\n\nY\nP\nbe the minimal polynomial of X (ai are distinct). Assume that a0 = 0\n(we can do so since X is not nilpotent). Let\nr\ng(t) =\n(x - ai)mi xh(x),\ni=1\nwhere h is a polynomial chosen in such a way that g(a0) = 1, g(j)(a0) =\n0 for j = 1, ..., m0 - 1 (this is clearly possible). Then g(X) is an\nidempotent, so by Corollary 1.43.3, τ(g(X)) > 0. Hence there exists\nn > 0 such that τ(Xn) = 0, as desired.\n\n1.44. The Frobenius-Perron theorem. The following classical the\norem from linear algebra [Ga, XIII.2] plays a crucial role in the theory\nof tensor categories.\nTheorem 1.44.1. Let B be a square matrix with nonnegative entries.\n(1) B has a nonnegative real eigenvalue. The largest nonnegative\nreal eigenvalue λ(B) of B dominates the absolute values of all\nother eigenvalues μ of B: |μ| ≤ λ(B) (in other words, the spec\ntral radius of B is an eigenvalue). Moreover, there is an eigen\nvector of B with nonnegative entries and eigenvalue λ(B).\n(2) If B has strictly positive entries then λ(B) is a simple positive\neigenvalue, and the corresponding eigenvector can be normalized\nto have strictly positive entries. Moreover, |μ| < λ(B) for any\nother eigenvalue μ of B.\n(3) If B has an eigenvector v with strictly positive entries, then the\ncorresponding eigenvalue is λ(B).\nProof. Let B be an n by n matrix with nonnegative entries. Let us first\nshow that B has a nonnegative eigenvalue. If B has an eigenvector v\nwith nonnegative entries and eigenvalue 0, then there is nothing to\nprove. Otherwise, let Σ be the set of column vectors x ∈ Rn with\nwith nonnegative entries xi and s(x) :=\nxi equal to 1 (this is a\nsimplex). Define a continuous map fB : Σ → Σ by fB(x) = s(\nB\nB\nx\nx) . By\nthe Brouwer fixed point theorem, this map has a fixed point f. Then\nBf = λf, where λ > 0. Thus the eigenvalue λ(B) is well defined, and\nB always has a nonnegative eigenvector f with eigenvalue λ = λ(B).\nNow assume that B has strictly positive entries. Then f must have\nstrictly positive entries fi. If d is another real eigenvector of B with\neigenvalue λ, let z be the smallest of the numbers of di/fi. Then the\nvector v = d - zf satisfies Bv = λv, has nonnegative entries and has\none entry equal to zero. Hence v = 0 and λ is a simple eigenvalue.\n\nP\nX X\nX\nP\nNow let y = (y1, ..., yn) ∈ Cn be a row vector. Define the norm\n|y| :=\n|yj|fj . Then\n|yB| =\n|\nyibij |fj ≤\n|yi|bij fj = λ|y|,\nj\ni\ni,j\nand the equality holds if and only if all the complex numbers\nyibij\nwhich are nonzero have the same argument. So if yB = μy, then\n|μ| ≤ λ, and if |μ| = λ then all yi which are nonzero have the same\nargument, so we can renormalize y to have nonnegative entries. This\nimplies that μ = λ. Thus, part (2) is proved.\nNow consider the general case (B has nonnegative entries). Assume\nthat B has a row eigenevector y with strictly positive entries and eigen\nvalue μ. Then\nμyf = yBf = λyf,\nwhich implies μ = λ, as yf = 0. This implies (3).\nIt remains to finish the proof of part (1) (i.e. to prove that λ(B)\ndominates all other eigenvalues of B). Let ΓB be the oriented graph\nwhose vertices are labeled by 1, ..., n, and there is an edge from j to\ni if and only if bij > 0. Let us say that i is accessible from j if there\nis a path in ΓB leading from j to i. Let us call B irreducible if any\nvertex is accessible from any other. By conjugating B by a permutation\nmatrix if necessary, we can get to a situation when i ≥ j implies that\ni is accessible from j. This means that B is a block upper triangular\nmatrix, whose diagonal blocks are irreducible. So it suffices to prove\nthe statement in question for irreducible B.\nBut if B is irreducible, then for some N the matrix 1 + B +\n+ BN\n· · ·\nhas strictly positive entries. So the nonnegative eigenvector f of B\nwith eigenvalue λ(B) is actually strictly positive, and one can run the\nargument in the proof of part (2) with a norm bound (all that is used\nin this argument is the positivity of f). Hence, the result follows from\n(2).\n\n1.45. Tensor categories with finitely many simple objects. Frobenius-\nPerron dimensions. Let A be a Z+-ring with Z+-basis I.\nDefinition 1.45.1. We will say that A is transitive if for any X, Z ∈ I\nthere exist Y1, Y2 ∈ I such that XY1 and Y2X involve Z with a nonzero\ncoefficient.\nProposition 1.45.2. If C is a ring category with right duals then Gr(C)\nis a transitive unital Z+-ring.\nProof. Recall from Theorem 1.15.8 that the unit object 1 in C is simple.\nSo Gr(C) is unital. This implies that for any simple objects X, Z of C,\nthe object X ⊗ X∗ ⊗ Z contains Z as a composition factor (as X ⊗ X∗\ncontains 1 as a composition factor), so one can find a simple object\nY1 occurring in X∗ ⊗ Z such that Z occurs in X ⊗ Y1. Similarly, the\nobject Z ⊗ X∗ ⊗ X contains Z as a composition factor, so one can find\na simple object Y2 occurring in Z ⊗ X∗ such that Z occurs in Y2 ⊗ X.\nThus Gr(C) is transitive.\n\nLet A be a transitive unital Z+-ring of finite rank. Define the group\nhomomorphism FPdim : A → C as follows. For X ∈ I, let FPdim(X) be\nthe maximal nonnegative eigenvalue of the matrix of left multiplication\nby X. It exists by the Frobenius-Perron theorem, since this matrix has\nnonnegative entries. Let us extend FPdim from the basis I to A by\nadditivity.\nDefinition 1.45.3. The function FPdim is called the Frobenius-Perron\ndimension.\nIn particular, if C is a ring category with right duals and finitely many\nsimple objects, then we can talk about Frobenius-Perron dimensions of\nobjects of C.\nProposition 1.45.4. Let X ∈ I.\n(1) The number α = FPdim(X) is an algebraic integer, and for any\nalgebraic conjugate α0 of α we have α ≥|α0|.\n(2) FPdim(X) ≥ 1.\nProof. (1) Note that α is an eigenvalue of the integer matrix NX of left\nmultiplication by X, hence α is an algebraic integer. The number α0 is\na root of the characteristic polynomial of NX , so it is also an eigenvalue\nof NX . Thus by the Frobenius-Perron theorem α ≥|α0|.\n(2) Let r be the number of algebraic conjugates of α. Then αr ≥\nN(α) where N(α) is the norm of α. This implies the statement since\nN(α) ≥ 1.\n\nP\nP\nP\nProposition 1.45.5.\n(1) The function FPdim : A\nC is a ring\n→\nhomomorphism.\n(2) There exists a unique, up to scaling, element R ∈ AC := A⊗Z C\nsuch that XR = FPdim(X)R, for all X ∈ A. After an appro\npriate normalization this element has positive coefficients, and\nsatisfies FPdim(R) > 0 and RY = FPdim(Y )R, Y ∈ A.\n(3) FPdim is a unique nonzero character of A which takes non\nnegative values on I.\n(4) If X ∈ A has nonnegative coefficients with respect to the basis of\nA, then FPdim(X) is the largest nonnegative eigenvalue λ(NX )\nof the matrix NX of multiplication by X.\nProof. Consider the matrix M of right multiplication by\nX∈I X in A\nin the basis I. By transitivity, this matrix has strictly positive entries,\nso by the Frobenius-Perron theorem, part (2), it has a unique, up to\nscaling, eigenvector R ∈ AC with eigenvalue λ(M) (the maximal posi\ntive eigenvalue of M). Furthermore, this eigenvector can be normalized\nto have strictly positive entries.\nSince R is unique, it satisfies the equation XR = d(X)R for some\nfunction d : A\nC. Indeed, XR is also an eigenvector of M with\n→\neigenvalue λ(M), so it must be proportional to R. Furthermore, it\nis clear that d is a character of A. Since R has positive entries,\nd(X) = FPdim(X) for X ∈ I. This implies (1). We also see that\nFPdim(X) > 0 for X ∈ I (as R has strictly positive coefficients), and\nhence FPdim(R) > 0.\nNow, by transitivity, R is the unique, up to scaling, solution of the\nsystem of linear equations XR = FPdim(X)R (as the matrix N of left\nmultiplication by\nX∈I X also has positive entries). Hence, RY =\nd0(Y )R for some character d0. Applying FPdim to both sides and using\nthat FPdim(R) > 0, we find d0 = FPdim, proving (2).\nIf χ is another character of A taking positive values on I, then the\nvector with entries χ(Y ), Y ∈ I is an eigenvector of the matrix N of the\nleft multiplication by the element\nX∈I X. Because of transitivity of\nA the matrix N has positive entries. By the Frobenius-Perron theorem\nthere exists a positive number λ such that χ(Y ) = λ FPdim(Y ). Since\nχ is a character, λ = 1, which completes the proof.\nFinally, part (4) follows from part (2) and the Frobenius-Perron the\norem (part (3)).\n\nExample 1.45.6. Let C be the category of finite dimensional repre\nsentations of a quasi-Hopf algebra H, and A be its Grothendieck ring.\nThen by Proposition 1.10.9, for any X, Y ∈C\ndim Hom(X ⊗ H, Y ) = dim Hom(H, ∗X ⊗ Y ) = dim(X) dim(Y ),\n\nX\nX\n\nwhere H is the regular representation of H. Thus X ⊗ H = dim(X)H,\nso FPdim(X) = dim(X) for all X, and R = H up to scaling.\nThis example motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 1.45.7. The element R will be called a regular element of\nA.\nProposition 1.45.8. Let A be as above and ∗ : I\nI be a bijection\n→\nwhich extends to an anti-automorphism of A. Then FPdim is invariant\nunder ∗.\nProof. Let X ∈ I. Then the matrix of right multiplication by X∗ is\nthe transpose of the matrix of left multiplication by X modified by\nthe permutation ∗. Thus the required statement follows from Proposi\ntion 1.45.5(2).\n\nCorollary 1.45.9. Let C be a ring category with right duals and finitely\nmany simple objects, and let X be an object in C. If FPdim(X) = 1\nthen X is invertible.\nProof. By Exercise 1.15.10(d) it is sufficient to show that X ⊗ X∗ =\n1. This follows from the facts that 1 is contained in X ⊗ X∗ and\nFPdim(X ⊗ X∗) = FPdim(X) FPdim(X∗) = 1.\n\nProposition 1.45.10. Let f : A1 → A2 be a unital homomorphism of\ntransitive unital Z+-rings of finite rank, whose matrix in their Z+-bases\nhas non-negative entries. Then\n(1) f preserves Frobenius-Perron dimensions.\n(2) Let I1, I2 be the Z+-bases of A1, A2, and suppose that for any\nY in I2 there exists X ∈ I1 such that the coefficient of Y in\nf(X) is non-zero. If R is a regular element of A1 then f(R) is\na regular element of A2.\nProof. (1) The function X 7→ FPdim(f(X)) is a nonzero character of\nA1 with nonnegative values on the basis. By Proposition 1.45.5(3),\nFPdim(f(X)) = FPdim(X) for all X in I. (2) By part (1) we have\n(1.45.1)\nf(\nX)f(R1) = FPdim(f(\nX))f(R1).\nP\nX∈I1\nX∈I1\nBut f(\nX∈I1 X) has strictly positive coefficients in I2, hence f(R1) =\nβR2 for some β > 0. Applying FPdim to both sides, we get the result.\nCorollary 1.45.11. Let C and D be tensor categories with finitely\nmany classes of simple objects.

If λ(B) < 2 then λ(B) =\n2 cos(π/n) for some integer n ≥ 2.\nProof. Let λ(B) = q + q-1 . Then q is an algebraic integer, and |q| =\n1. Moreover, all conjugates of λ(B)2 are nonnegative (since they are\n\neigenvalues of the matrix BBT , which is symmetric and nonnegative\ndefinite), so all conjugates of λ(B) are real. Thus, if q∗ is a conjugate of\nq then q∗ +q-1 is real with absolute value < 2 (by the Frobenius-Perron\n∗\ntheorem), so |q∗| = 1. By a well known result in elementary algebraic\nnumber theory, this implies that q is a root of unity: q = e2πik/m, where\nk and m are coprime. By the Frobenius-Perron theorem, so k = ±1,\nand m is even (indeed, if m = 2p + 1 is odd then |qp + q-p| > |q + q-1|).\nSo q = eπi/n for some integer n ≥ 2, and we are done.\n\nCorollary 1.45.16.

Then C D = C ⊗ D - mod.\n(iv) The bifunctor is exact in both variables and satisfies\nHomC(X1, Y1) ⊗ HomD(X2, Y2) ∼= HomCD(X1 X2, Y1 Y2).\n(v) any bilinear bifunctor F : C × D →A exact in each variable\ndefines an exact functor F : C D →A.\nProof. (sketch). (ii) follows from the universal property in the usual\nway.\n(i) As we know, a finite abelian category is equivalent to the category\nof finite dimensional modules over an algebra. So there exist finite\ndimensional algebras C, D such that C = C - mod, D = D - mod.\nThen one can define C D = C ⊗ D - mod, and it is easy to show that\n\nP\nit satisfies the required conditions. This together with (ii) also implies\n(iii).\n(iv),(v) are routine.\n\nA similar result is valid for locally finite categories.\nDeligne's tensor product can also be applied to functors. Namely, if\nF : C →C0 and G : D →D0 are additive right exact functors between\nfinite abelian categories then one can define the functor F G : CD →\nC0 D0.\nProposition 1.46.3. If C, D are multitensor categories then the cate\ngory C D has a natural structure of a multitensor category.\nProof. Let X1 Y1, X2 Y2 ∈C D. Then we can set\n(X1 Y1) ⊗ (X2 Y2) := (X1 ⊗ X2) (Y1 Y2).\nand define the associativity isomorphism in the obvious way. This\ndefines a structure of a monoidal category on the subcategory of C\nD consisting of \"-decomposable\" objects of the form X Y . But\nany object of C D admits a resolution by -decomposable injective\nobjects. This allows us to use a standard argument with resolutions to\nextend the tensor product to the entire category C D. It is easy to see\nthat if C, D are rigid, then so is C D, which implies the statement.\n1.47. Finite (multi)tensor categories. In this subsection we will\nstudy general properties of finite multitensor and tensor categories.\nRecall that in a finite abelian category, every simple object X has a\nprojective cover P (X). The object P (X) is unique up to a non-unique\nisomorphism. For any Y in C one has\n(1.47.1)\ndim Hom(P (X), Y ) = [Y : X].\nLet K0(C) denote the free abelian group generated by isomorphism\nclasses of indecomposable projective objects of a finite abelian category\nC. Elements of K0(C) ⊗Z C will be called virtual projective objects. We\nhave an obvious homomorphism γ : K0(C)\nGr(C). Although groups\n→\nK0(C) and Gr(C) have the same rank, in general γ is neither surjective\nnor injective even after tensoring with C. The matrix C of γ in the\nnatural basis is called the Cartan matrix of C; its entries are [P (X) : Y ],\nwhere X, Y are simple objects of C.\nNow let C be a finite multitensor category, let I be the set of isomor\nphism classes of simple objects of C, and let i∗, ∗i denote the right and\nleft duals to i, respectively. Let Gr(C) be the Grothendieck ring of C,\nspanned by isomorphism classes of the simple objects Xi, i ∈ I. In this\nring, we have XiXj =\nk Nij\nk Xk, where Nij\nk are nonnegative integers.\nAlso, let Pi denote the projective covers of Xi.\n\nX\nX\nProposition 1.47.1. Let C be a finite multitensor category. Then\nK0(C) is a Gr(C)-bimodule.\nProof. This follows from the fact that the tensor product of a projective\nobject with any object is projective, Proposition 1.13.6.\n\nLet us describe this bimodule explicitly.\nProposition 1.47.2. For any object Z of C,\n= ⊕j,kN i\n= ⊕j,kN i\nPi ⊗ Z ∼\nkj∗ [Z : Xj ]Pk, Z ⊗ Pi ∼\n∗jk[Z : Xj ]Pk.\nProof. Hom(Pi ⊗ Z, Xk) = Hom(Pi, Xk ⊗ Z∗), and the first formula\nfollows from Proposition 1.13.6. The second formula is analogous.\nProposition 1.47.3. Let P be a projective object in a multitensor\ncategory C. Then P ∗ is also projective. Hence, any projective object in\na multitensor category is also injective.\nProof. We need to show that the functor Hom(P ∗, ) is exact. This\n-\nfunctor is isomorphic to Hom(1, P ⊗-). The functor P ⊗- is exact\nand moreover, by Proposition 1.13.6, any exact sequence splits after\ntensoring with P , as an exact sequence consisting of projective objects.\nThe Proposition is proved.\n\nProposition 1.47.3 implies that an indecomposable projective object\nP has a unique simple subobject, i.e. that the socle of P is simple.\nFor any finite tensor category C define an element RC ∈ K0(C) ⊗Z C\nby\n(1.47.2)\nR =\nFPdim(Xi)Pi.\nC\ni∈I\nDefinition 1.47.4. The virtual projective object RC is called the reg\nular object of C.\nDefinition 1.47.5. Let C be a finite tensor category. Then the Frobenius-\nPerron dimension of C is defined by\n(1.47.3)\nFPdim(C) := FPdim(RC) =\nFPdim(Xi) FPdim(Pi).\ni∈I\nExample 1.47.6. Let H be a finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra.\nThen FPdim(Rep(H)) = dim(H).\nProposition 1.47.7.\n(1) Z ⊗ RC = RC ⊗ Z = FPdim(Z)RC for all\nZ ∈ Gr(C).\n(2) The image of RC in Gr(C) ⊗Z C is a regular element.\n\n-\n-\nP\nP\nP\nProof. We have\nFPdim(Xi) dim Hom(Pi, Z) = FPdim(Z) for any ob\ni\nject Z of C.\nX\nHence,\nX\nFPdim(Xi) dim Hom(Pi ⊗ Z, Y ) =\nFPdim(Xi) dim Hom(Pi, Y ⊗ Z∗)\ni\ni\n= FPdim(Y ⊗ Z∗)\n= FPdim(Y ) FPdim(Z∗)\n= FPdim(Y ) FPdim(Z)\nX\n= FPdim(Z)\nFPdim(Xi) dim Hom(Pi, Y ).\ni\nNow, P (X)⊗Z are projective objects by Proposition 1.13.6. Hence, the\nformal sums\nFPdim(Xi)Pi⊗Z = RC⊗Z and FPdim(Z)\nFPdim(Xi)Pi =\ni\ni\nFPdim(Z)RC are linear combinations of Pj , j ∈ I with the same coeffi\ncients.\n\nRemark 1.47.8. We note the following useful inequality:\n(1.47.4)\nFPdim(C) ≥ N FPdim(P ),\nwhere N is the number of simple objects in C, and P is the projective\ncover of the neutral object 1. Indeed, for any simple object V the\nprojective object P (V ) ⊗ ∗V has a nontrivial homomorphism to 1, and\nhence contains P . So FPdim(P (V )) FPdim(V ) ≥ FPdim(P ). Adding\nthese inequalities over all simple V , we get the result.\n1.48. Integral tensor categories.\nDefinition 1.48.1. A transitive unital Z+-ring A of finite rank is said\nto be integral if FPdim : A\nZ (i.e. the Frobenius-Perron dimnensions\n→\nof elements of C are integers). A tensor category C is integral if Gr(C)\nis integral.\nProposition 1.48.2. A finite tensor category C is integral if and only\nif C is equivalent to the representation category of a finite dimensional\nquasi-Hopf algebra.\nProof. The \"if\" part is clear from Example 1.45.6. To prove the \"only\nif\" part, it is enough to construct a quasi-fiber functor on C. Define\nP = ⊕i FPdim(Xi)Pi, where Xi are the simple objects of C, and Pi\nare their projective covers. Define F = Hom(P, ). Obviously, F is\n-\nexact and faithful, F (1) ∼= 1, and dim F (X) = FPdim(X) for all X ∈\nC. Using Proposition 1.46.2, we continue the functors F (- ⊗-) and\nF ( ) ⊗ F ( ) to the functors C C → Vec. Both of these functors are\nexact and take the same values on the simple objects of C C. Thus\nthese functors are isomorphic and we are done.\n\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nCorollary 1.48.3. The assignment H 7→ Rep(H) defines a bijection\nbetween integral finite tensor categories C over k up to monoidal equiva\nlence, and finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebras H over k, up to twist\nequivalence and isomorphism.\n1.49. Surjective quasi-tensor functors. Let C, D be abelian cate\ngories. Let F : C →D be an additive functor.\nDefinition 1.49.1. We will say that F is surjective if any object of D\nis a subquotient in F (X) for some X ∈C. 13\nExercise 1.49.2. Let A, B be coalgebras, and f : A\nB a homomor\n→\nphism. Let F = f ∗ : A - comod → B - comod be the corresponding\npushforward functor. Then F is surjective if and only if f is surjective.\nNow let C, D be finite tensor categories.\nTheorem 1.49.3. ([EO]) Let F : C →D be a surjective quasi-tensor\nfunctor. Then F maps projective objects to projective ones.\nProof. Let C be a finite tensor category, and X ∈C. Let us write\nX as a direct sum of indecomposable objects (such a representation\nis unique). Define the projectivity defect p(X) of X to be the sum\nof Frobenius-Perron dimensions of all the non-projective summands in\nthis sum (this is well defined by the Krull-Schmidt theorem). It is clear\nthat p(X ⊕ Y ) = p(X) + p(Y ). Also, it follows from Proposition 1.13.6\nthat p(X ⊗ Y ) ≤ p(X)p(Y ).\nLet Pi be the indecomposable projective objects in C. Let Pi ⊗ Pj ∼=\n⊕kBk Pk, and let Bi be the matrix with entries Bk Also, let B =\nBi.\nij\nij .\nObviously, B has strictly positive entries, and the Frobenius-Perron\neigenvalue of B is\ni FPdim(Pi).\nOn the other hand, let F : C →D be a surjective quasi-tensor functor\nbetween finite tensor categories. Let pj = Pp(F (Pj )), and Pp be the vector\nwith entries pj . Then we get pipj\nBk\nso (\npi)p ≥ Bp.\n≥\nk\nij pk,\ni\nSo, either pi are all zero, or they are all positive, and the norm of\nB with respect to the norm |x| =\npi|xi| is at most\npi. Since\npi ≤ FPdim(Pi), this implies pi = FPdim(Pi) for all i (as the largest\neigenvalue of B is\ni FPdim(Pi)).\nAssume the second option is the case. Then F (Pi) do not contain\nnonzero projective objects as direct summands, and hence for any pro\njective P ∈C, F (P ) cannot contain a nonzero projective object as a\ndirect summand. However, let Q be a projective object of D. Then,\n13This definition does not coincide with a usual categorical definition of surjec\ntivity of functors which requires that every object of D be isomorphic to some F (X)\nfor an object X in C.\n\nsince F is surjective, there exists an object X ∈C such that Q is a\nsubquotient of F (X). Since any X is a quotient of a projective object,\nand F is exact, we may assume that X = P is projective. So Q occurs\nas a subquotient in F (P ). As Q is both projective and injective, it is\nactually a direct summand in F (P ). Contradiction.\nThus, pi = 0 and F (Pi) are projective. The theorem is proved.\n\n1.50. Categorical freeness. Let C, D be finite tensor categories, and\nF : C →D be a quasi-tensor functor.\nTheorem 1.50.1. One has\nFPdim(C)\n(1.50.1)\nF (RC ) = FPdim(D) RD.\nProof. By Theorem 1.49.3, F (RC) is a virtually projective object. Thus,\nF (RC ) must be proportional to RD, since both (when written in the ba\nsis Pi) are eigenvectors of a matrix with strictly positive entries with its\nFrobenius-Perron eigenvalue. (For this matrix we may take the matrix\nof multiplication by F (X), where X is such that F (X) contains as com\nposition factors all simple objects of D; such exists by the surjectivity\nof F ). The coefficient is obtained by computing the Frobenius-Perron\ndimensions of both sides.\n\nCorollary 1.50.2. In the above situation, one has FPdim(C) ≥ FPdim(D),\nand FPdim(D) divides FPdim(C) in the ring of algebraic integers. In\nfact,\nFPdim(C)\nX\n(1.50.2)\nFPdim(D) =\nFPdim(Xi) dim Hom(F (Pi), 1D),\nwhere Xi runs over simple objects of C.\nProof. The statement is obtained by computing the dimension of Hom(-, 1D)\nfor both sides of (1.50.1).\n\nSuppose now that C is integral, i.e., by Proposition 1.48.2, it is the\nrepresentation category of a quasi-Hopf algebra H. In this case, RC\nis an honest (not only virtual) projective object of C, namely the free\nrank 1 module over H. Theorefore, multiples of RC are free H-modules\nof finite rank, and vice versa.\nThen Theorem 1.49.3 and the fact that F (RC ) is proportional to RD\nimplies the following categorical freeness result.\nCorollary 1.50.3. If C is integral, and F : C →D is a surjective\nquasi-tensor functor then D is also integral, and the object F (RC) is\nfree of rank FPdim(C)/ FPdim(D) (which is an integer).\n\nProof. The Frobenius-Perron dimensions of simple objects of D are\ncoordinates of the unique eigenvector of the positive integer matrix of\nmultiplication by F (RC ) with integer eigenvalue FPdim(C), normalized\nso that the component of 1 is 1. Thus, all coordinates of this vector are\nrational numbers, hence integers (because they are algebraic integers).\nThis implies that the category D is integral. The second statement is\nclear from the above.\n\nCorollary 1.50.4. ([Scha]; for the semisimple case see [ENO1]) A\nfinite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra is a free module over its quasi-\nHopf subalgebra.\nRemark 1.50.5. In the Hopf case Corollary 1.50.3 is well known and\nmuch used; it is due to Nichols and Zoeller [NZ].\n\n1.51. The distinguished invertible object. Let C be a finite tensor\ncategory with classes of simple objects labeled by a set I. Since duals\nto projective objects are projective, we can define a map D : I\nI\nsuch that Pi\n∗ = PD(i). It is clear that D2(i) = i∗∗.\n→\nLet 0 be the label for the unit object. Let ρ = D(0). (In other words,\n∗Lρ is the socle of P0 = P (1)). We have\nHom(Pi\n∗, Lj ) = Hom(1, Pi ⊗ Lj ) = Hom(1, ⊕kN i\nkj∗ Pk).\nThis space has dimension N i\nThus we get\nρj∗ .\nN i\nρj∗ = δD(i),j.\nLet now Lρ be the corresponding simple object. By Proposition 1.47.2,\nwe have\n= ⊕kN k\n= PD(m)∗ .\nL∗\nρ ⊗ Pm ∼\nρmPk ∼\nLemma 1.51.1. Lρ is an invertible object.\nProof. The last equation implies that the matrix of action of Lρ∗ on\nprojectives is a permutation matrix. Hence, the Frobenius-Perron di\nmension of Lρ∗ is 1, and we are done.\n\nLemma 1.51.2. One has: PD(i) = P∗i ⊗ Lρ; LD(i) = L∗i ⊗ Lρ.\nProof. It suffices to prove the first statement. Therefore, our job is to\nshow that dim Hom(Pi\n∗, Lj ) = dim Hom(P∗i, Lj ⊗ Lρ∗ ). The left hand\nside was computed before, it is N i\nOn the other hand, the right hand\nρj∗ .\nside is N\n∗i (we use that ρ∗ = ∗ρ for an invertible object ρ). These\nj,ρ∗\nnumbers are equal by the properies of duality, so we are done.\n\nCorollary 1.51.3. One has: Pi∗∗ = L∗\nρ⊗P∗∗i⊗Lρ; Li∗∗ = L∗\nρ⊗L∗∗i⊗Lρ.\nProof. Again, it suffices to prove the first statement. We have\nPi∗∗ = Pi\n∗∗ = (P∗i ⊗ Lρ)∗ = Lρ\n∗ ⊗ P∗∗\ni = L∗\nρ ⊗ P∗∗i ⊗ Lρ\nDefinition 1.51.4. Lρ is called the distinguished invertible object of C.\nWe see that for any i, the socle of Pi is Lˆi := L∗\nρ ⊗∗∗ Li = L∗∗\ni ⊗ Lρ\n∗.\nThis implies the following result.\nCorollary 1.51.5. Any finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra H is a\nFrobenius algebra, i.e. H is isomorphic to H∗ as a left H-module.\nProof. It is easy to see that that a Frobenius algebra is a quasi-Frobenius\nalgebra (i.e. a finite dimensional algebra for which projective and in\njective modules coincide), in which the socle of every indecomposable\n\nP\nprojective module has the same dimension as its cosocle (i.e., the simple\nquotient). As follows from the above, these conditions are satisfied for\nfinite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebras (namely, the second condition\nfollows from the fact that Lρ is 1-dimensional).\n\n1.52. Integrals in quasi-Hopf algebras.\nDefinition 1.52.1. A left integral in an algebra H with a counit ε :\nH\nk is an element I ∈ H such that xI = ε(x)I for all x ∈ H.\n→\nSimilarly, a right integral in H is an element I ∈ H such that Ix = ε(x)I\nfor all x ∈ H.\nRemark 1.52.2. Let H be the convolution algebra of distributions\non a compact Lie group G. This algebra has a counit ε defined by\nε(ξ) = ξ(1). Let dg be R a left-invariant Haar measure on G. Then\nthe distribution I(f) = G f(g)dg is a left integral in H (unique up to\nscaling). This motivates the terminology.\nNote that this example makes sense for a finite group G over any\nfield k. In this case, H = k[G], and I =\ng∈G g is both a left and a\nright integral.\nProposition 1.52.3. Any finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra ad\nmits a unique nonzero left integral up to scaling and a unique nonzero\nright integral up to scaling.\nProof. It suffices to prove the statement for left integrals (for right\nintegrals the statement is obtained by applying the antipode). A left\nintegral is the same thing as a homomorphism of left modules k\nH.\n→\nSince H is Frobenius, this is the same as a homomorphism k\nH∗, i.e.\n→\na homomorphism H\nk. But such homomorphisms are just multiples\nof the counit.\n→\n\nNote that the space of left integrals of an algebra H with a counit\nis a right H-module (indeed, if I is a left integral, then so is Iy for all\ny ∈ H). Thus, for finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebras, we obtain\na character χ : H\nk, such that Ix = χ(x)I for all x ∈ H. This\n→\ncharacter is called the distinguished character of H (if H is a Hopf\nalgebra, it is commonly called the distinguished grouplike element of\nH∗, see [Mo]).\nProposition 1.52.4. Let H be a finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra,\nand C = Rep(H). Then Lρ coincides with the distinguished character\nχ.\nProof. Let I be a nonzero left integral in H. We have xI = ε(x)I and\nIx = χ(x)I. This means that for any V ∈C, I defines a morphism\nfrom V ⊗ χ-1 to V .\n\nThe element I belongs to the submodule Pi of H, whose socle is\nthe trivial H-module. Thus, Pi\n∗ = P (1), and hence by Lemma 1.51.2,\ni = ρ. Thus, I defines a nonzero (but rank 1) morphism Pρ ⊗χ-1 → Pρ.\nThe image of this morphism, because of rank 1, must be L0 = 1, so\n1 is a quotient of Pρ ⊗ χ-1, and hence χ is a quotient of Pρ. Thus,\nχ = Lρ, and we are done.\n\nProposition 1.52.5. The following conditions on a finite dimensional\nquasi-Hopf algebra H are equivalent:\n(i) H is semisimple;\n(ii) ε(I) = 0 (where I is a left integral in H);\n(iii) I2 = 0\n;\n(iv) I can be normalized to be an idempotent.\nProof. (ii) implies (i): If ε(I) = 0 then k = 1 is a direct summand in\nH as a left H-module. This implies that 1 is projective, hence Rep(H)\nis semisimple (Corollary 1.13.7).\n(i) implies (iv): If H is semisimple, the integral is a multiple of the\nprojector to the trivial representation, so the statement is obvious.\n(iv) implies (iii): obvious.\n(iii) implies (ii): clear, since I2 = ε(I)I.\n\nDefinition 1.52.6. A finite tensor category C is unimodular if Lρ = 1.\nA finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra H is unimodular if Rep(H) is\na unimodular category, i.e. if left and right integrals in H coincide.\nRemark 1.52.7. This terminology is motivated by the notion of a\nunimodular Lie group, which is a Lie group on which a left invariant\nHaar measure is also right invariant, and vice versa.\nRemark 1.52.8. Obviously, every semisimple category is automati\ncally unimodular.\nExercise 1.52.9. (i) Let H be the Nichols Hopf algebra of dimension\n2n+1 (Example 1.24.9). Find the projective covers of simple objects,\nthe distinguished invertible object, and show that H is not unimod\nular. In particular, Sweedler's finite dimensional Hopf algebra is not\nunimodular.\n(ii) Do the same if H is the Taft Hopf algebra (Example 1.24.5).\n(iii) Let H = uq (sl2) be the small quantum group at a root of unity q\nof odd order (see Subsection 1.25). Show that H is unimodular, but H∗\nis not. Find the distinguished character of H∗ (i.e., the distinguished\ngrouplike element of H). What happens for the corresponding graded\nHopf algebra gr(H)?\n\n1.53. Dimensions of projective objects and degeneracy of the\nCartan matrix. The following result in the Hopf algebra case was\nproved by M.Lorenz [L]; our proof in the categorical setting is analogous\nto his.\nLet Cij = [Pi : Lj ] be the entries of the Cartan matrix of a finite\ntensor category C.\nTheorem 1.53.1. Suppose that C is not semisimple, and admits an\nisomorphism of additive functors u : Id → ∗∗. Then the Cartan matrix\nC is degenerate over the ground field k.\nProof. Let dim(V ) = Tr|V (u) be the dimension function defined by\nthe (left) categorical trace of u. This function is additive on exact\nsequences, so it is a linear functional on Gr(C).\nOn the other hand, the dimension of every projective object P with\nrespect to this function is zero. Indeed, the dimension of P is the\ncomposition of maps 1 → P ⊗ P ∗ → P ∗∗ ⊗ P ∗ → 1, where the maps\nare the coevaluation, u ⊗ Id, and the evaluation. If this map is nonzero\nthen 1 is a direct summand in P ⊗ P ∗, which is projective. Thus 1 is\nprojective, So C is semisimple by Corollary 1.13.7. Contradiction.\nSince the dimension of the unit object 1 is not zero, 1 is not a linear\ncombination of projective objects in the Grothendieck group tensored\nwith k. We are done.\n\n2. Module categories\nWe have seen that the notion of a tensor category categorifies the\nnotion of a ring. In a similar way, the notion of a module category\ncategorifies the notion of a module over a ring. In this section we will\ndevelop a systematic theory of module categories over tensor categories.\nThis theory is interesting by itself, but is also crucial for understanding\nthe structure of tensor categories, similarly to how the study of modules\nis improtant in understanding the structure of rings.\nWe will begin with a discussion of module categories over general\nmonoidal categories, and then pass to the k-linear case.\n2.1. The definition of a module category. Let C be a monoidal\ncategory.\nDefinition 2.1.1. A left module category over C is a category M\nequipped with an action (or tensor product) bifunctor ⊗M : C × M →\nM and a functorial associativity isomorphism (or constraint) aM :\n(- ⊗-) ⊗M - →- ⊗ (- ⊗M -), such that the functor 1⊗M : M →M\n\nt\n* *\n( (\nv\nis an autoequivalence, and aM satisfies the pentagon relation:\n(2.1.1)\n((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z) ⊗M M\naM\naX,Y,Z ⊗IdM\nX⊗Y,Z,M\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\nUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\n(X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ (Z ⊗M M)\n(X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)) ⊗ M\naM\naM\nX,Y ⊗Z,M\nX,Y,Z⊗MM �\nIdX ⊗aM\n�\nY,Z,M\nX ⊗ (Y ⊗ (Z ⊗ M)) �\nX ⊗ ((Y ⊗ Z) ⊗M M)\nis commutative for all objects X, Y, Z in C and M in M.\nClearly, this definition categorifies the notion of a module over a\nmonoid.\nIn a similar way one defines a right C-module category. Namely, a\nright C-module category is the same thing as a left Cop-module category.\nBy a module category we will always mean a left module category unless\notherwise specified.\nSimilarly to the case of monoidal categories, for any C-module cate\ngory M, one has a canonical functorial unit isomorphism lM : 1⊗M →\nId (also called the unit constraint), and one can give the following\nequivalent definition of a module category, making this isomorphism a\npart of the data.\nDefinition 2.1.2. A left module category over C is a category M\nequipped with a bifunctor ⊗M : C × M → M, a functorial isomor\nphism aM : (-⊗-) ⊗M - → -⊗ (-⊗M -), and a functorial isomorphism\nlM : 1⊗M → Id such that aM satisfies the pentagon relation (2.1.1),\nand lM satisfies the triangle relation:\naM\nX,1,M\n(2.1.2)\n(X ⊗ 1) ⊗M M\n� X ⊗M (1 ⊗M M) ,\nrX ⊗MId\nId⊗MlM\nM\nQQQQQQQQQQQQ\nmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nX ⊗M M\nX ∈C, M ∈M.\nWe leave it to the reader to establish the equivalence of the two\ndefinitions; this is entirely parallel to the case of monoidal categories.\nSimilarly to the case of monoidal categories, one can assume without\nloss of generality that 1⊗M = IdM, lM = Id, and we will often do so\nfrom now on. We will also often suppress the superscript M and write\n⊗ instead of ⊗M.\n\nThe following proposition gives an alternative definition of a module\ncategory. Let M be a category. Consider the category End(M) of\nendofunctors of M. As we know, End(M) is a monoidal category.\nExercise 2.1.4. Fill the details in the proof of Proposition 2.1.3.\n⏐⏐y\nProposition 2.1.3. Structures of a C-module category on M are in a\nnatural 1-1 correspondence with monoidal functors F : C → End(M).\nProof. Let F : C\n→ End(M) be a monoidal functor.\nWe set\nX ⊗ M := F (X)(M), and define the associativity constraint aM us\ning the monoidal structure on F , as a composition (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ M =\nF (X ⊗ Y )(M) ' F (X)(F (Y )(M)) = X ⊗ (Y ⊗ M).\nConversely, let M be a module category over C. Then for any\nX ∈C we have a functor M 7→ X ⊗ M; thus we have a functor\nF : C → End(M). Using the associativity isomorphism aM, one de\nfines a monoidal structure on F .\n\nClearly, Proposition 2.1.3 categorifies the fact in elementary algebra\nthat a module over a ring is the same thing as a representation.\nRemark 2.1.5. Note that under the correspondence of Proposition\n2.1.3, the hexagon diagram for the monoidal structure on F corresponds\nto the pentagon diagram (2.1.1). One of the sides of the hexagon\ndisappears due to the fact that the category End(M) is strict, so its\nassociativity isomorphism (which is the identity) is suppressed.\n⏐⏐y\nDefinition 2.1.6. A module subcategory of a C-module category M is\na full subcategory M0 ⊂M which is closed under the action of C.\nExercise 2.1.7. Let M be a C-module category. Show that for any\nX ∈C which has a left dual and any M, N ∈M there a natural\nisomorphism Hom(X ⊗ M, N) ' Hom(M, ∗X ⊗ N). Thus, if C is rigid,\nthe functor X∗⊗ is left adjoint to X⊗, and ∗X⊗ is right adjoint to\nX⊗.\n2.2. Module functors.\nDefinition 2.2.1. Let M1 and M2 be two module categories over C. A\nmodule functor from M1 to M2 is a pair (F, s) where F : M1 →M2\nis a functor, and s is a natural isomorphism sX,M : F (X ⊗ M) →\nX ⊗ F (M) such that the following diagrams commute:\n(2.2.1)\nF ((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ M)\nsX⊗Y,M\nF (X ⊗ (Y ⊗ M)) ←------\n----→ (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ F (M)\nF (aX,Y,M )\nX ⊗ F (Y ⊗ M)\nsX,Y ⊗M\nId ⊗ sY,M\n-\naX,Y,F (M)\nX ⊗ (Y ⊗ F (M))\n\nand\n(2.2.2)\nF (1 ⊗ M)\nF (lM )\n�\nLLLLLLLLLL\ns1,M\n� 1 ⊗ F (M)\nlF (M )\n�rrrrrrrrrr\nF (M)\nA module equivalence F : M1 →M2 of C-module categories is a\nmodule functor (F, s) from M1 to M2 such that F is an equivalence\nof categories.\nClearly, this definition categorifies the notion of a homomorphism\n(respectively, isomorphism) of modules.\nRemark 2.2.2. Note that if lMi = Id then the second diagram reduces\nto the condition that s1,M = IdF (M).\nRemark 2.2.3. One can prove a version of Maclane's coherence theo\nrem for module categories and module functors, stating that positions\nof brackets are, essentially, immaterial (we leave it to the reader to\nstate and prove this theorem). For this reason, when working with\nmodule categories, we will suppress brackets from now on.\n2.3. Module categories over multitensor categories. Our main\ninterest will be module categories over multitensor categories (defined\nover a field k). In this case, we would like to consider module categories\nwith an additional structure of an abelian category.\nLet C be a multitensor category over k.\nDefinition 2.3.1. A (left or right) abelian module category over C is\na locally finite abelian category M over k which is equipped with a\nstructure of a (left or right) C-module category, such that the functor\n⊗M is bilinear on morphisms and exact in the first variable.\nRemark 2.3.2. Note that ⊗M is always exact in the second variable\ndue to Exercise 2.1.7.\nAll module categories over multitensor categories that we will con\nsider will be abelian, so we will usually suppress the word \"abelian\"\nfrom now on.\nLet EndL(M) be the category of left exact functors from M to M.\nThis is an abelian category. (Namely, if M is the category of finite\ndimensional comodules over a coalgebra C then EndL(M) is equivalent\nto a full subcategory of the category of C-bicomodules, via F 7→ F (C);\nnote that F (C) is well defined, since F , being left exact, commutes\nwith direct limits, and thus extends to the ind-completion of M).\n\nProposition 2.3.3. Structures of a C-module category on M are in\na natural 1-1 correspondence with exact monoidal functors F : C →\nEnd(M).\nProof. The proof is the same as that of Proposition 2.1.3.\n\nWe will also need to consider module functors between abelian mod\nule categories. Unless otherwise specified, we will consider only left\nexact module functors, referring to them just as \"module functors\".\n2.4. Direct sums. There is a very simple construction of the direct\nsum of module categories.\nProposition 2.4.1. Let M1, M2 be two module categories over C.\nThen the category M = M1 ⊕M2 with ⊗M = ⊗M1 ⊕⊗M2 , aM =\naM1 ⊕ aM2 , lM = lM1 ⊕ lM2 is a module category over C.\nProof. Obvious.\n\nDefinition 2.4.2. The module category M is called the direct sum of\nmodule categories M1 and M2.\nDefinition 2.4.3. We will say that a module category M over C is in-\ndecomposable if it is not equivalent to a nontrivial direct sum of module\ncategories (that is, with M1, M2 nonzero).\n2.5. Examples of module categories. The following are some basic\nexamples of module categories.\nExample 2.5.1. Any multitensor category C is a module category\nover itself; in this case we set ⊗M = ⊗, aM = a, lM = l. This\nmodule category can be considered as a categorification of the regular\nrepresentation of an algebra.\nExample 2.5.2. Let C be a multitensor category. Then one considers\nM = C as a module category over CCop via (XY )⊗MZ = X⊗Z⊗Y .\n(This can be extended to the entire category CCop by resolving objects\nof this category by injective -decomposable objects).\nExercise 2.5.3. Define the associativity and unit constraints for this\nexample using the associativity and unit constraints in C.\nThis module category corresponds to the algebra considered as a\nbimodule over itself.\nDefinition 2.5.4. Let C, D be multitensor categories. A (C, D)-bimodule\ncategory is a module category over C Dop.\n\nL\nExample 2.5.5. Let C be a multitensor category and let C =\ni,j Cij\nbe its decomposition into components (see Proposition 1.15.5). Then\nobviously Cij is a (Cii, Cjj )-bimodule category.\nExample 2.5.6. Let us study when the simplest category M = Vec is\na module category over a multitensor category C. Obviously Fun(M, M) =\nVec as a tensor category. Hence by Proposition 2.1.3 the structures of\nthe module category over C on M are in a natural bijection with tensor\nfunctors F : C → Vec, that is, with fiber functors. Thus the theory of\nmodule categories can be considered as an extension of the theory of\nfiber functors.\nExample 2.5.7. Let F : C →D be a tensor functor. Then M = D\nhas a structure of module category over C with X ⊗M Y := F (X) ⊗ Y .\nExercise 2.5.8. Define the associativity and unit constraints for this\nexample using the tensor structure of the functor F and verify the\naxioms.\nExample 2.5.9. Let G be a finite group and let H ⊂ G be a subgroup.\nSince the restriction functor Res : Rep(G)\nRep(H) is tensor functor,\n→\nwe conclude that Rep(H) is a module category over C = Rep(G). A lit\ntle bit more generally, assume that we have a central extension of groups\n1 → k× → H → H → 1 representing an element ψ ∈ H2(H, k×).\nConsider the category Repψ(H) of representations of H such that any\nλ ∈ k× acts by multiplication by λ (thus any object of Repψ(H) is a\nprojective representation of H). Then usual tensor product and usual\nassociativity and unit constraints determine the structure of module\ncategory over C on M = Repψ(H). One can show that all semisimple\nindecomposable module categories over C = Rep(G) are of this form.\nExample 2.5.10. Let C = VecG, where G is a group. In this case, a\nmodule category M over C is an abelian category M with a collection\nof exact functors Fg : M →M, Fg(M) := g ⊗ M, together with a\ncollection of functorial isomorphisms ηg,h : Fg * Fh → Fgh satisfying the\n2-cocycle relation:\nηgh,k * ηgh = ηg,hk * ηhk\nas morphisms Fg * Fh * Fk → Fghk.\nSuch data is called an action of G on M. So, module categories over\nVecG is the same thing as abelian categories with an action of G.\nExample 2.5.11. Here is an example which we consider as somewhat\npathological with respect to finiteness properties: let C = Vec and let\nM = Vec be the category of all (possibly infinite dimensional) vector\n\nspaces. Then the usual tensor product and the usual associativity and\nunit constraints determine the structure of module category over C on\nM.\n2.6. Exact module categories for finite tensor categories. Con\nsider the simplest tensor category C = Vec. Let M be any abelian\ncategory over k. Then M has a unique (up to equivalence) structure\nof module category over C. Thus in this case the understanding of\nall module categories over C is equivalent to the understanding of all\nk-linear abelian categories. This seems to be too complicated even if\nrestrict ourselves only to categories satisfying some finiteness conditions\n(for example, to finite categories). Thus in this section we introduce a\nmuch smaller class of module categories which is quite manageable (for\nexample, this class admits an explicit classification for many interesting\ntensor categories C) but on the other hand contains many interesting\nexamples. Here is the main definition:\nDefinition 2.6.1. Let C be a multitensor category with enough pro\njective objects. A module category M over C is called exact if for any\nprojective object P ∈C and any object M ∈M the object P ⊗ M is\nprojective in M.\nExercise 2.6.2. Let M be an arbitrary module category over C. Show\nthat for any object X ∈C and any projective object Q ∈M the object\nX ⊗ Q is projective in M.\nIt is immediate from the definition that any semisimple module cat\negory is exact (since any object in a semisimple category is projective).\nRemark 2.6.3. We will see that the notion of an exact module cat\negory may be regarded as the categorical analog of the notion of a\nprojective module in ring theory.\nExample 2.6.4. Notice that in the category C = Vec the object 1\nis projective. Therefore for an exact module category M over C any\nobject M = 1 ⊗ M is projective. Hence an abelian category M consid\nered as a module category over C is exact if and only if it is semisimple.\nThus the exact module categories over Vec are classified by the cardi\nnality of the set of the isomorphism classes of simple objects. More\ngenerally, the same argument shows that if C is semisimple (and hence\n1 is projective) then any exact module category over C is semisimple.\nBut the classification of exact module categories over non-semisimple\ncategories C can be quite nontrivial.\nExample 2.6.5. Any finite multitensor category C considered as a\nmodule category over itself (see Example 2.5.1) is exact. Also the\n\ncategory C considered as a module over C Cop (see Example 2.5.2) is\nexact.\nExample 2.6.6. Let C and D be a finite multitensor categories and\nlet F : C →D be a surjective tensor functor. Then the category D\nconsidered as a module category over C (see Example 2.5.7) is exact by\nTheorem 1.49.3.\nExercise 2.6.7. Show that the assumption that F is surjective is es\nsential for this example.\n\n2.7. First properties of exact module categories.\nLemma 2.7.1. Let M be an exact module category over finite multi-\ntensor category C. Then the category M has enough projective objects.\nProof. Let P0 denote the projective cover of the unit object in C. Then\nthe natural map P0 ⊗ X\n1 ⊗ X ' X is surjective for any X ∈M\n→\nsince ⊗ is exact. Also P0 ⊗ X is projective by definition of an exact\nmodule category.\n\nCorollary 2.7.2. Assume that an exact module category M over C\nhas finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects. Then M is\nfinite.\nLemma 2.7.3. Let M be an exact module category over C. Let P ∈C\nbe projective and X ∈M. Then P ⊗ X is injective.\nProof. The functor Hom( , P ⊗ X) is isomorphic to the functor\n-\nHom(P ∗ ⊗-, X). The object P ∗ is projective by Proposition 1.47.3.\nThus for any exact sequence\nY1 → Y2 → Y3 → 0\n→\nthe sequence\n0 → P ∗ ⊗ Y1 → P ∗ ⊗ Y2 → P ∗ ⊗ Y3 → 0\nsplits, and hence the functor Hom(P ∗ ⊗-, X) is exact. The Lemma is\nproved.\n\nCorollary 2.7.4. In the category M any projective object is injective\nand vice versa.\nProof. Any projective object X of M is a direct summand of the object\nof the form P0 ⊗ X and thus is injective.\n\nRemark 2.7.5. A finite abelian category A is called a quasi-Frobenius\ncategory if any projective object of A is injective and vice versa. Thus\nany exact module category over a finite multitensor category (in par\nticular, any finite multitensor category itself) is a quasi-Frobenius cat\negory. It is well known that any object of a quasi-Frobenius category\nadmitting a finite projective resolution is projective (indeed, the last\nnonzero arrow of this resolution is an embedding of projective (= injec\ntive) modules and therefore is an inclusion of a direct summand. Hence\nthe resolution can be replaced by a shorter one and by induction we\nare done). Thus any quasi-Frobenius category is either semisimple or\nof infinite homological dimension.\n\nLet Irr(M) denote the set of (isomorphism classes of) simple objects\nin M. Let us introduce the following relation on Irr(M): two objects\nX, Y ∈ Irr(M) are related if Y appears as a subquotient of L ⊗ X for\nsome L ∈C.\nLemma 2.7.6. The relation above is reflexive, symmetric and transi\ntive.\nProof. Since 1 ⊗ X = X we have the reflexivity. Let X, Y, Z ∈ Irr(M)\nand L1, L2 ∈C. If Y is a subquotient of L1 ⊗ X and Z is a subquotient\nof L2 ⊗Y then Z is a subquotient of (L2 ⊗L1)⊗X (since ⊗ is exact), so\nwe get the transitivity. Now assume that Y is a subquotient of L ⊗ X.\nThen the projective cover P (Y ) of Y is a direct summand of P0 ⊗L⊗X;\nhence there exists S ∈C such that Hom(S ⊗ X, Y ) =6\n0 (for example\nS = P0 ⊗ L). Thus Hom(X, S∗ ⊗ Y ) = Hom(S ⊗ X, Y ) = 0 and hence\nX is a subobject of S∗ ⊗ Y . Consequently our equivalence relation is\nsymmetric.\n\nThus our relation is an equivalence relation. Hence Irr(M) is par\n\ntitioned into equivalence classes, Irr(M) =\ni∈I Irr(M)i. For an\nequivalence class i ∈ I let Mi denote the full subcategory of M con\nsisting of objects whose all simple subquotients lie in Irr(M)i. Clearly,\nMi is a module subcategory of M.\nProposition 2.7.7. The module categories Mi are exact. The category\nM is the direct sum of its module subcategories Mi.\nProof. For any X ∈ Irr(M)i its projective cover is a direct summand\nof P0 ⊗ X and hence lies in the category Mi. Hence the category M\nis the direct sum of its subcategories Mi, and Mi are exact.\n\nA crucial property of exact module categories is the following\nProposition 2.7.8. Let M1 and M2 be two module categories over\nC. Assume that M1 is exact. Then any additive module functor F :\nM1 →M2 is exact.\nProof. Let 0\nX\nY\nZ\n0 be an exact sequence in M1. Assume\n→\n→\n→\n→\nthat the sequence 0\nF (X)\nF (Y )\nF (Z)\n0 is not exact. Then\n→\n→\n→\n→\nthe sequence 0\nP ⊗ F (X)\nP ⊗ F (Y )\nP ⊗ F (Z)\n0 is also\n→\n→\n→\n→\nnon-exact for any nonzero object P ∈C since the functor P ⊗- is\nexact and P ⊗ X = 0 implies X = 0. In particular we can take P to be\nprojective. But then the sequence 0\nP ⊗X\nP ⊗Y\nP ⊗Z\n0 is\n→\n→\n→\n→\nexact and split and hence the sequence 0\nF (P ⊗ X)\nF (P ⊗ Y )\n→\n→\n→\nF (P ⊗ Z) → 0 is exact and we get a contradiction.\n\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nRemark 2.7.9. We will see later that this Proposition actually char\nacterizes exact module categories.\n2.8. Z+-modules. Recall that for any multitensor category C its Grothendieck\nring Gr(C) is naturally a Z+-ring.\nDefinition 2.8.1. Let K be a Z+-ring with basis {bi}. A Z+-module\nover K is a K-module M with fixed Z-basis {ml} such that all the\nstructure constants ail\nk (defined by the equality biml =\nk ail\nk mk) are\nnonnegative integers.\nThe direct sum of Z+-modules is also a Z+-module whose basis is\na union of bases of summands. We say that Z+-module is indecom\nposable if it is not isomorphic to a nontrivial direct sum.\nLet M be a finite module category over C. By definition, the Grothendieck\ngroup Gr(M) with the basis given by the isomorphism classes of sim\nple objects is a Z+-module over Gr(C). Obviously, the direct sum of\nmodule categories corresponds to the direct sum of Z+-modules.\nExercise 2.8.2. Construct an example of an indecomposable module\ncategory M over C such that Gr(M) is not indecomposable over Gr(C).\nNote, however, that, as follows immediately from Proposition 2.7.7,\nfor an indecomposable exact module category M the Z+-module Gr(M)\nis indecomposable over Gr(C). In fact, even more is true.\nDefinition 2.8.3. A Z+-module M over a Z+-ring K is called irre\nducible if it has no proper Z+-submodules (in other words, the Z-span\nof any proper subset of the basis of M is not a K-submodule).\nExercise 2.8.4. Give an example of Z+-module which is not irre\nducible but is indecomposable.\nLemma 2.8.5. Let M be an indecomposable exact module category\nover C. Then Gr(M) is an irreducible Z+-module over Gr(C).\nExercise 2.8.6. Prove this Lemma.\nProposition 2.8.7. Let K be a based ring of finite rank over Z. Then\nthere exists only finitely many irreducible Z+-modules over K.\nProof. First of all, it is clear that an irreducible Z+-module M over\nK is of finite rank over Z. Let {ml}l∈L be the basis of M. Let us\nconsider an element b :=\nbi∈B bi of K. Let b2 =\ni nibi and let\nN = maxbi∈B ni (N exists since B is finite). For any l ∈ L let bml =\nk∈L dk\nl mk and let dl :=\nk∈L dk\nl > 0. Let l0 ∈ I be such that d := dl0\nequals minl∈L dl. Let b2ml0 =\nl∈L clml. Calculating b2ml0 in two ways\n\nX\n\n-- as (b2)ml0 and as b(bml0 ), and computing the sum of the coefficients,\nwe have:\nNd ≥\ncl ≥ d2\nl\nand consequently d ≤ N. So there are only finitely many possibilities\nfor |L|, values of ci and consequently for expansions biml (since each\nml appears in bml0 ). The Proposition is proved.\nIn particular, for a given finite multitensor category C there are only\n⏐⏐y\nfinitely many Z+-modules over Gr(C) which are of the form Gr(M)\nwhere M is an indecomposable exact module category over C.\nExercise 2.8.8. (a) Classify irreducible Z+-modules over ZG (An\nswer: such modules are in bijection with subgroups of G up to conju\ngacy).\n(b) Classify irreducible Z+-modules over Gr(Rep(S3)) (consider all\n⏐⏐y\nthe cases: chark = 2, 3, chark = 2, chark = 3).\n(c) Classify irreducible Z+-modules over the Yang-Lee and Ising\nbased rings.\nNow we can suggest an approach to the classification of exact mod\nule categories over C: first classify irreducible Z+-modules over Gr(C)\n(this is a combinatorial part), and then try to find all possible cate\ngorifications of a given Z+-module (this is a categorical part). Both\nthese problems are quite nontrivial and interesting. We will see later\nsome nontrivial solutions to this.\n2.9. Algebras in categories.\nDefinition 2.9.1. An algebra in a multitensor category C is a triple\n(A, m, u) where A is an object of C, and m, u are morphisms (called\nmultiplication and unit morphisms) m : A ⊗ A\nA, u : 1\nA such\n→\n→\nthat the following axioms are satisfied:\n1. Associativity: the following diagram commutes:\nA ⊗ A ⊗ A\nm⊗id\n---→ A ⊗ A\n(2.9.1)\nid⊗m\nm\nA ⊗ A\n---→\nA\nm\n2. Unit: The morphisms A → 1 ⊗ A → A ⊗ A → A and A →\nA ⊗ 1 → A ⊗ A → A are both equal to IdA.\n\nOf course, in the case when C = Vec, we get definition of an asso\nciative algebra with unit, and in the case C = Vec we get the definition\nof a finite dimensional associative algebra with unit.\nRemark 2.9.2. If C is not closed under direct limits (e.g., C is a\nmultitensor category), one can generalize the above definition, allowing\nA to be an ind-object (i.e., \"infinite dimensional\"). However, we will\nmostly deal with algebras honestly in C (i.e., \"finite dimensional\"), and\nwill make this assumption unless otherwise specified.\nExample 2.9.3. 1. 1 is an algebra.\n2. The algebra of functions Fun(G) on a finite group G (with values\nin the ground field k) is an algebra in Rep(G) (where G acts on itself\nby left multiplication).\n3. Algebras in VecG is the same thing as G-graded algebras. In\nparticular, if H is a subgroup of G then the group algebra C[H] is an\nalgebra in VecG.\n4. More generally, let ω be a 3-cocycle on G with values in k×, and ψ\nbe a 2-cochain of G such that ω = dψ. Then one can define the twisted\ngroup algebra Cψ[H] in Vecω , which is ⊕h∈H h as an object of Vecω\nG\nG,\nand the multiplication h ⊗ h0 → hh0 is the operation of multiplication\nby ψ(h, h0). If ω = 1 (i.e., ψ is a 2-cocycle), the twisted group algebra\nis associative in the usual sense, and is a familiar object from group\ntheory. However, if ω is nontrivial, this algebra is not associative in the\nusual sense, but is only associative in the tensor category Vecω , which,\nG\nas we know, does not admit fiber functors.\nExample 2.9.4. Let C be a multitensor category and X ∈C. Then the\nobject A = X ⊗ X∗ has a natural structure of an algebra with unit in\nC given by the coevaluation morphism and multiplication Id ⊗evX ⊗ Id.\nIn particular for X = 1 we get a (trivial) structure of an algebra on\nA = 1.\nWe leave it to the reader to define subalgebras, homomorphisms,\nideals etc in the categorical setting.\nNow we define modules over algebras:\nDefinition 2.9.5. A (right) module over an algebra (A, m, u) (or just\nan A-module) is a pair (M, p), where M ∈C and p is a morphism\nM ⊗ A\nM such that the following axioms are satisfied:\n→\n1. The following diagram commutes:\n\np⊗id\n---→ M ⊗ A\n⏐⏐y\nM ⊗ A ⊗ A\n(2.9.2)\nid⊗m\n⏐⏐y\np\nM ⊗ A\n---→\nM\np\n2. The composition M\nM ⊗ 1\nM ⊗ A\nM is the identity.\n→\n→\n→\nThe definition of a left module is entirely analogous.\nDefinition 2.9.6. The homomorphism between two A-modules (M1, p1)\n⏐⏐y\nand (M2, p2) is a morphism l ∈ HomC(M1, M2) such that the following\ndiagram commutes:\nM1 ⊗ A\nl⊗id\n---→ M2 ⊗ A\n⏐⏐y\n(2.9.3)\np1\np2\nl\nM1\n---→\nM2\nObviously, homomorphisms form a subspace of the the vector space\nHom(M1, M2). We will denote this subspace by HomA(M1, M2). It is\neasy to see that a composition of homomorphisms is a homomorphism.\nThus A-modules form a category ModC (A).\nExercise 2.9.7. Check that ModC(A) is an abelian category.\nThe following observations relate the categories ModC (A) and mod\nule categories:\nExercise 2.9.8. For any A-module (M, p) and any X ∈C the pair\n(X ⊗ M, id ⊗ p) is again an A-module.\nThus we have a functor ⊗ : C × ModC(A) → ModC (A).\nExercise 2.9.9. For any A-module (M, p) and any X, Y ∈C the\nassociativity morphism aX,Y,M : (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ M\nX ⊗ (Y ⊗ M) is an\n→\nisomorphism of A-modules. Similarly the unit morphism 1 ⊗ M\nM\n→\nis an isomorphism of A-modules.\nThis exercise defines associativity and unit constraints a, l for the\ncategory ModC (A).\nProposition 2.9.10. The category ModC (A) together with functor ⊗\nand associativity and unit constraints a , l is a left module category over\nC.\n\nExercise 2.9.11. Prove this Proposition.\nThe following statement is very useful:\nLemma 2.9.12. For any X\nwe have a canonical isomorphism\n∈C\nHomA(X ⊗ A, M) = Hom(X, M).\nExercise 2.9.13. Prove this Lemma.\nExercise 2.9.14. Is it true that any object of ModC (A) is of the form\nX ⊗ A for some X ∈C?\nExercise 2.9.15. Show that for any M ∈ ModC (A) there exists X ∈C\nand a surjection X ⊗ A\nM (namely, X = M regarded as an object\n→\nof C).\nExercise 2.9.16. Assume that the category C has enough projective\nobjects. Then the category ModC(A) has enough projective objects.\nExercise 2.9.17. Assume that the category C is finite. Then the\ncategory ModC (A) is finite.\nThus we get a general construction of module categories from al\ngebras in the category C. Not any module category over C is of the\nform ModC (A): for C = Vec the module category of all (possibly in\nfinite dimensional) vector spaces (see Example 2.5.11) is not of this\nform. But note that for C = Vec any finite module category is of the\nform ModC (A) (just because every finite abelian category is equivalent\nto Mod(A) for some finite dimensional algebra A). We will show later\nthat all finite module categories over a finite C are of the form ModC(A)\nfor a suitable A. But of course different algebras A can give rise to the\nsame module categories.\nDefinition 2.9.18. We say that two algebras A and B in C are Morita\nequivalent if the module categories ModC (A) and ModC (B) are module\nequivalent.\nNote that in the case C = Vec this definition specializes to the usual\nnotion of Morita equivalence of finite dimensional algebras.\nExample 2.9.19. We will see later that all the algebras from Exam\nple 2.9.4 are Morita equivalent; moreover any algebra which is Morita\nequivalent to A = 1 is of the form X ⊗ X∗ for a suitable X ∈C.\nNot any module category of the form ModC (A) is exact:\nExercise 2.9.20. Give an example of module category of the form\nModC (A) which is not exact.\n\nThus we are going to use the following\nDefinition 2.9.21. An algebra A in the category C is called exact if\nthe module category ModC (A) is exact.\nIt is obvious from the definition that the exactness is invariant under\nMorita equivalence.\nWe will need the notion of a tensor product over an algebra A ∈C.\nDefinition 2.9.22. Let A be an algebra in C and let (M, pM ) be a right\nA-module, and (N, pN ) be a left A-module. A tensor product over\nA, M ⊗A N ∈C, is the quotient of M ⊗ N by the image of morphism\npM ⊗ id - id ⊗ pN : M ⊗ A ⊗ N → M ⊗ N.\nExercise 2.9.23. Show that the functor ⊗A is right exact in each\nvariable (that is, for fixed M, N, the functors M ⊗A - and - ⊗A N are\nright exact).\nDefinition 2.9.24. Let A, B be two algebras in C. An A-B-bimodule\nis a triple (M, p, q) where M ∈C, p ∈ Hom(A ⊗ M, M), q ∈ Hom(M ⊗\nB, M) such that\n1. The pair (M, p) is a left A-module.\n2. The pair (M, q) is a right B-module.\n3. The morphisms q (p⊗id) and p (id⊗q) from Hom(A⊗M ⊗B, M)\n*\n*\ncoincide.\nRemark 2.9.25. Note that in the categorical setting, we cannot define\n(A, B)-bimodules as modules over A ⊗ Bop, since the algebra A ⊗ Bop\nis, in general, not defined.\nWe will usually say \"A-bimodule\" instead of \"A - A-bimodule\".\nExercise 2.9.26. Let M be a right A-module, N be an A-B-bimodule\nand P be a left B-module. Construct the associativity morphism\n(M ⊗A N) ⊗A P\nM ⊗A (N ⊗A P ). State and prove the pentagon\n→\nrelation for this morphism.\n2.10. Internal Hom. In this section we assume that the category C\nis finite. This is not strictly necessary but simplifies the exposition.\nAn important technical tool in the study of module categories is\nthe notion of internal Hom. Let M be a module category over C and\nM1, M2 ∈M. Consider the functor Hom(-⊗M1, M2) from the category\nC to the category of vector spaces. This functor is left exact and thus\nis representable\nRemark 2.10.1. If we do not assume that the category C is finite, the\nfunctor above is still representable, but by an ind-object of C. Working\n\nwith ind-objects, one can extend the theory below to this more general\ncase. We leave this for an interested reader.\nDefinition 2.10.2. The internal Hom Hom(M1, M2) is an object of C\nrepresenting the functor Hom(- ⊗ M1, M2).\nNote that by Yoneda's Lemma (M1, M2) 7→ Hom(M1, M2) is a bi\nfunctor.\nExercise 2.10.3. Show that the functor Hom(-, ) is left exact in both\n-\nvariables.\nLemma 2.10.4. There are canonical isomorphims\n(1) Hom(X ⊗ M1, M2) ∼= Hom(X, Hom(M1, M2)),\n(2) Hom(M1, X ⊗ M2) ∼= Hom(1, X ⊗ Hom(M1, M2)),\n(3) Hom(X ⊗ M1, M2) ∼= Hom(M1, M2) ⊗ X∗,\n(4) Hom(M1, X ⊗ M2) ∼= X ⊗ Hom(M1, M2).\nProof. Formula (1) is just the definition of Hom(M1, M2), and isomor\nphism (2) is the composition\nHom(M1, X ⊗ M2) ∼= Hom(X∗ ⊗ M1, M2) =\n= Hom(X∗, Hom(M1, M2)) ∼\n= Hom(1, X ⊗ Hom(M1, M2)).\nWe get isomorphism (3) from the calculation\nHom(Y, Hom(X⊗M1, M2)) = Hom(Y ⊗(X⊗M1), M2) = Hom((Y ⊗X)⊗M1, M2) =\n= Hom(Y ⊗ X, Hom(M1, M2)) = Hom(Y, Hom(M1, M2) ⊗ X∗),\nand isomorphism (4) from the calculation\nHom(Y, Hom(M1, X ⊗ M2)) = Hom(Y ⊗ M1, X ⊗ M2) =\n= Hom(X∗ ⊗ (Y ⊗ M1), M2) = Hom((X∗ ⊗ Y ) ⊗ M1, M2) =\n= Hom(X∗ ⊗ Y, Hom(M1, M2)) = Hom(Y, X ⊗ Hom(M1, M2)).\nCorollary 2.10.5. (1) For a fixed M1, the assignment M2 7→ Hom(M1, M2)\nis a module functor M →C;\n(2) For a fixed M2, the assignment M1 7→ Hom(M1, M2) is a module\nfunctor M →Cop.\nProof. This follows from the isomorphisms (4) and (3) of Lemma 2.10.4.\nCorollary 2.10.5 and Proposition 2.7.8 imply\nCorollary 2.10.6. Assume that M is an exact module category. Then\nthe functor Hom(-, -) is exact in each variable.\n\n-\n-\nThe mere definition of the internal Hom allows us to prove the con\nverse to Proposition 2.7.8:\nProposition 2.10.7. (1) Suppose that for a module category M over\nC, the bifunctor Hom is exact in the second variable, i.e., for any object\nN ∈M the functor Hom(N, ) : M →C is exact. Then M is exact.\n-\n(2) Let M1, M2 be two nonzero module categories over C. Assume\nthat any module functor from M1 to M2 is exact. Then the module\ncategory M1 is exact.\nProof. (1) Let P ∈C be any projective object. Then for any N ∈M\none has Hom(P ⊗ N, ) = Hom(P, Hom(N, )), and thus the functor\nHom(P ⊗ N, ) is exact. By the definition of an exact module category,\n-\nwe are done.\n(2) First we claim that under our assumptions any module functor\nF ∈ FunC(M1, C) is exact. Indeed, let 0 =6\nM ∈M2. The functor\nF ( )⊗M ∈ FunC(M1, M2) is exact. Since -⊗M is exact, and X⊗M =\n-\n0 implies X = 0, we see that F is exact.\nIn particular, we see that for any object N\nthe functor\n∈M1,\nHom(N, -) : M1 →C is exact, since it is a module functor. Now\n(2) follows from (1).\n\nExample 2.10.8. It is instructive to calculate Hom for the category\nModC (A). Let M, N ∈ ModC(A). We leave it to the reader as an\nexercise to check that Hom(M, N) = (M ⊗A ∗N)∗ (note that ∗N has\na natural structure of a left A-module). One deduces from this de\nscription of Hom that exactness of A is equivalent to biexactness of the\nfunctor ⊗A.\nFor two objects M1, M2 of a module category M we have the canon\nical morphism\nevM1,M2 : Hom(M1, M2) ⊗ M1 → M2\nobtained as the image of Id under the isomorphism\nHom(Hom(M1, M2), Hom(M1, M2)) ∼= Hom(Hom(M1, M2) ⊗ M1, M2).\nLet M1, M2, M3 be three objects of M. Then there is a canonical\ncomposition morphism\n(Hom(M2, M3)⊗Hom(M1, M2))⊗M1 ∼= Hom(M2, M3)⊗(Hom(M1, M2)⊗M1)\nId ⊗evM1,M2\nevM2,M3\n-→\nHom(M2, M3) ⊗ M2 -→ M3\nwhich produces the multipication morphism\nHom(M2, M3) ⊗ Hom(M1, M2)\nHom(M1, M3).\n→\n\nExercise 2.10.9. Check that this multiplication is associative and\ncompatible with the isomorphisms of Lemma 2.10.4.\n\n2.11. Main Theorem.\nExercise 2.11.1. Show that for any M ∈M the object Hom(M, M)\nwith the multiplication defined above is an algebra (in particular, define\nthe unit morphism!).\nTheorem 2.11.2. Let M be a module category over C, and assume\nthat M ∈M satisfies two conditions:\n1. The functor Hom(M, ) is right exact (note that it is automatically\n-\nleft exact).\n2. For any N ∈M there exists X ∈C and a surjection X ⊗M\nN.\n→\nLet A = Hom(M, M). Then the functor F := Hom(M, ) : M →\n-\nModC (A) is an equivalence of module categories.\nProof. We will proceed in steps:\n(1) The map F : Hom(N1, N2)\nHomA(F (N1), F (N2)) is an iso\n→\nmorphism for any N2 ∈M and N1 of the form X ⊗ M, X ∈C.\nIndeed, F (N1) = Hom(M, X ⊗ M) = X ⊗ A and the statement\nfollows from the calculation:\nHomA(F (N1), F (N2)) = HomA(X ⊗ A, F (N2)) = Hom(X, F (N2)) =\n= Hom(X, Hom(M, N2)) = Hom(X ⊗ M, N2) = Hom(N1, N2).\n(2) The map F : Hom(N1, N2)\nHomA(F (N1), F (N2)) is an iso\n→\nmorphism for any N1, N2 ∈M.\nBy condition 2, there exist objects X, Y ∈C and an exact sequence\nY ⊗ M\nX ⊗ M\nN1 → 0.\n→\n→\nSince F is exact, the sequence\nF (Y ⊗ M)\nF (X ⊗ M)\nF (N1)\n→\n→\n→\nis exact. Since Hom is left exact, the rows in the commutative diagram\n0 -→\n⏐⏐y\nHom(N1, N2)\nF\n-→\n⏐⏐y\nHom(X ⊗ M, N2)\nF\n-→\n⏐⏐y\nHom(Y ⊗ M, N2)\nF\n0 -\nHom(F (N1), F (N2)) -\nHom(F (X ⊗ M), F (N2)) -\nHom(F (Y ⊗ M), F (N2))\n→\n→\n→\nare exact. Since by step (1) the second and third vertical arrows are\nisomorphisms, so is the first one.\n(3) The functor F is surjective on isomorphism classes of objects of\nModC (A).\nWe know (see Exercise 2.9.15) that for any object L ∈ ModC(A)\nthere exists an exact sequence\nf\nY ⊗ A -→ X ⊗ A → L → 0\n\nfor some X, Y ∈C. Let f ∈ Hom(Y ⊗ M, X ⊗ M) be the preimage of\nf under the isomorphism\nHom(Y ⊗M, X⊗M) ∼\n= HomA(Y ⊗A, X⊗A)\n= HomA(F (Y ⊗M), F (X⊗M)) ∼\nand let N ∈M be the cokernel of f. It is clear that F (N) = L.\nWe proved that F is an equivalence of categories and proved the\nTheorem.\nRemark 2.11.3. This Theorem is a special case of Barr-Beck Theorem\nin category theory, see [ML]. We leave it to the interested reader to\n⏐⏐y\ndeduce Theorem 2.11.2 from Barr-Beck Theorem.\nWe have two situations where condition 1 of Theorem 2.11.2 is sat\nisfied:\n1. M is an arbitrary module category over C and M ∈M is projec\ntive.\n2. M is an exact module category and M ∈M is arbitrary.\n⏐⏐y\nExercise 2.11.4. Check that in both of these cases Hom(M, ) is exact\n-\n(Hint: in the first case first prove that Hom(M, N) is a projective object\nof C for any N ∈M).\nExercise 2.11.5. Show that in both of these cases condition 2 is equiv\nalent to the fact that [M] generates Gr(M) as Z+-module over Gr(C).\nThus we have proved\nTheorem 2.11.6. (i) Let M be a finite module category over C. Then\nthere exists an algebra A ∈C and a module equivalence M ' ModC (A).\n(ii) Let M be an exact module category over C and let M ∈M be\nan object such that [M] generates Gr(M) as Z+-module over Gr(C).\nThen there is a module equivalence M ' ModC (A) where A = Hom(M, M).\n2.12. Categories of module functors. Let M1, M2 be two module\ncategories over a multitensor category C, and let (F, s), (G, t) be two\nmodule functors M1 →M2.\nDefinition 2.12.1. A module functor morphism from (F, s) to (G, t)\nis a natural transformation a from F to G such that the following\ndiagram commutes for any X ∈C, M ∈M:\ns\nF (X ⊗ M) ---→ X ⊗ F (M)\n(2.12.1)\na\nid⊗a\nt\nG(X ⊗ M) ---→ X ⊗ G(M)\n\nIt is easy to see that the module functors with module functor mor\nphisms introduced above form a category called the category of mod\nule functors. This category is very difficult to manage (consider the\ncase\n= Vec !) and we are going to consider a subcategory. Let\nC\nF unC (M1, M2) denote the full subcategory of the category of module\nfunctors consisting of right exact module functors (which are not nec\nessarily left exact). First of all this category can be described in down\nto earth terms:\nProposition 2.12.2. Assume that M1 ' ModC (A) and M2 ' ModC (B)\nfor some algebras A, B ∈C. The category F unC (M1, M2) is equiva\nlent to the category of A - B-bimodules via the functor which sends a\nbimodule M to the functor - ⊗A M.\nProof. The proof repeats the standard proof from ring theory in the\ncategorical setting.\n\nThus we have the following\nCorollary 2.12.3. The category F unC(M1, M2) of right exact module\nfunctors from M1 to M2 is abelian.\nProof. Exercise.\n\nIn a similar way one can show that the category of left exact module\nfunctors is abelian (using Hom over A instead of tensor product over\nA).\nWe would like now to construct new tensor categories in the fol\nlowing way: take a module category M and consider the category\nF unC (M, M) with composition of functors as a tensor product.\nExercise 2.12.4. The category F unC (M, M) has a natural structure\nof monoidal category.\nBut in general the category F unC (M, M) is not rigid (consider the\ncase C = Vec!). Thus to get a good theory (and examples of new tensor\ncategories), we restrict ourselves to the case of exact module categories.\nWe will see that in this case we can say much more about the categories\nF unC (M, M) than in general.\n2.13. Module functors between exact module categories. Let\nM1 and M2 be two exact module categories over C. Note that the\ncategory F unC(M1, M2) coincides with the category of the additive\nmodule functors from M1 to M2 by Proposition 2.7.8.\nExercise 2.13.1. Any object of F unC (M1, M2) is of finite length.\n\nLemma 2.13.2. Let M1, M2, M3 be exact module categories over\nC. The bifunctor of composition F unC(M2, M3) × F unC(M1, M2) →\nF unC (M1, M3) is biexact.\nProof. This is an immediate consequence of Proposition 2.7.8.\n\nAnother immediate consequence of Proposition 2.7.8 is the following:\nLemma 2.13.3. Let M1, M2 be exact module categories over C. Any\nfunctor F ∈ F unC (M1, M2) has both right and left adjoint.\nWe also have the following immediate\nCorollary 2.13.4. Let M1, M2 be exact module categories over C.\nAny functor F ∈ F unC (M1, M2) maps projective objects to projectives.\nIn view of Example 2.6.6 this Corollary is a generalization of Theo\nrem 1.49.3 (but this does not give a new proof of Theorem 1.49.3).\nProposition 2.13.5. The category F unC (M1, M2) is finite.\nProof. We are going to use Theorem 2.11.2. Thus M1 = ModC (A1)\nand M2 = ModC (A2) for some algebras A1, A2 ∈C. It is easy to\nsee that the category F unC(M1, M2) is equivalent to the category of\n(A1, A2)-bimodules. But this category clearly has enough projective\nobjects: for any projective P ∈C the bimodule A1⊗P ⊗A2 is projective.\n2.14. Dual categories. Observe that the adjoint to a module func\ntor has itself a natural structure of a module functor (we leave it to\nthe reader to define this). In particular, it follows that the category\nF unC (M, M) is a rigid monoidal category.\nDefinition 2.14.1. We denote this category as C∗ and call it the dual\nM\ncategory to C with respect to M.\nBy Proposition 2.13.5, this category is finite.\nRemark 2.14.2. This notion is a categorical version of notion of the\nendomorphism ring of a module (i.e., a centralizer algebra), and gives\nmany new examples of tensor categories.\nLemma 2.14.3. The unit object 1 ∈C∗ is a direct sum of projectors\nM\nto subcategories Mi. Each such projector is a simple object.\nProof. The first statement is clear. For the second statement it is\nenough to consider the case when M is indecomposable. Let F be a\nnonzero module subfunctor of the identity functor. Then F (X) = 0\nfor any X = 0. Hence F (X) = X for any simple X ∈M and thus\nF (X) = X\nfor any X ∈M since F is exact.\n\nThus, the category C∗ is a finite multitensor category; in particular\nM\nif M is indecomposable then C∗ is finite tensor category. Note that\nM\nby the definition M is a module category over C∗ .\nM\nLemma 2.14.4. The module category M over C∗ is exact.\nM\n∗\nM\nProof. Let A ∈C be an algebra such that M = ModC(A). Thus the\ncategory C∗ is identified with the category Bimod(A)op of A-bimodules\nM\nwith opposite tensor product (because A-bimodules act naturally on\nModC (A) from the right). Any projective object in the category of\nA-bimodules is a direct summand of the object of the form A ⊗ P ⊗ A\nfor some projective P ∈C. Now for any M ∈ ModC (A) one has that\nM ⊗A A ⊗ P ⊗ A = (M ⊗ P ) ⊗ A is projective by exactness of the\ncategory ModC (A). The Lemma is proved.\n\nExample 2.14.5. It is instructive to consider the internal Hom for\nthe category ModC(A) considered as a module category over C∗ =\nM\nBimod(A). We leave to the reader to check that Hom\n(M, N) =\nC\n∗M\nN (the right hand side has an obvious structure of A bimodule).\n⊗\n-\n∗\n(A, A) = A\nA is an algebra in the category\n⊗\n∗\nM\nIn particular B = HomC\nof A-bimodules. Thus B is an algebra in the category C and it is easy\nto see from definitions that the algebra structure on B = ∗A ⊗ A\ncomes from the evaluation morphism ev : A ⊗ ∗A → 1. Moreover,\nthe coevaluation morphism induces an embedding of algebras A →\n∗A ⊗ A ⊗ A → ∗A ⊗ A = B and the A-bimodule structure of B comes\nfrom the left and right multiplication by A.\nThus for any exact module category M over C the category (C∗ )∗\nM M\nis well defined. There is an obvious tensor functor can : C → (C∗ )∗ .\nM M\nTheorem 2.14.6. The functor can : C → (C∗ )∗ is an equivalence of\nM M\ncategories.\nProof. Let A be an algebra such that M = ModC(A). The cate\ngory C∗ is identified with the category Bimod(A)op. The category\n(C∗ )∗\nM\nM M is identified with the category of B-bimodules in the category\nof A-bimodules (here B is the same as in Example 2.14.5 and is con\nsidered as an algebra in the category of A-modules). But this latter\ncategory is tautologically identified with the category of B-bimodules\n(here B is an algebra in the category C) since for any B-module one\nreconstructs the A-module structure via the embedding A\nB from\n→\nExample 2.14.5. We are going to use the following\nLemma 2.14.7. Any left B-module is of the form ∗A ⊗ X for some\nX ∈C with the obvious structure of an A-module. Similarly, any right\nB-module is of the form X ⊗ A.\n\n-\n-\nProof. Let us consider C as a module category over itself. Consider an\nobject ∗A ∈C as an object of this module category. Then by Example\n2.10.8 Hom(∗A, ∗A) = ∗A ⊗ A = B and the statement follows from\nTheorem 2.11.2. The case of right modules is completely parallel.\n\nIt follows from the Lemma that any B-bimodule is of the form\n∗A ⊗ X ⊗ A and it is easy to see that can(X) = ∗A ⊗ X ⊗ A. The\nTheorem is proved.\n\nRemark 2.14.8. Theorem 2.14.6 categorifies the classical \"double cen\ntralizer theorem\" for projective modules, which says that if A is a finite\ndimensional algebra and P is a projective A-module then the central\nizer of EndA(P ) in P is A.\nCorollary 2.14.9. Assume that C is a finite tensor (not only multi-\ntensor) category. Then an exact module category M over C is inde\ncomposable over C∗ .\nM\nProof. This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.14.6 and Lemma\n2.14.3.\n\nLet M be a fixed module category over C. For any other module cat\negory M1 over C the category FunC(M1, M) has an obvious structure\nof a module category over C∗ = FunC(M, M).\nM\nLemma 2.14.10. The module category FunC (M1, M) over C∗ is ex-\nM\nact.\nProof. Assume that M = ModC(A) and M1 = ModC (A1). Identify\nC∗ with the category of A-bimodules and FunC(M1, M) with the\nM\ncategory of (A1 -A)-bimodules. Any projective object of Bimod(A) is\na direct summand of an object of the form A⊗P ⊗A for some projective\nP ∈C. Let M be an (A1 - A)-bimodule, then M ⊗A A ⊗ P ⊗ A =\nM ⊗ P ⊗ A. Now HomA1-A(M ⊗ P ⊗ A, ) = HomA1 (M ⊗ P, ) (here\nHomA1-A is the Hom in the category of (A1 -A)-bimodules and HomA1\nis the Hom in the category of left A1-modules) and it is enough to\ncheck that M ⊗ P is a projective left A1-module. This is equivalent\nto (M ⊗ P )∗ being injective (since N 7→ N ∗ is an equivalence of the\ncategory of left A-modules to the category of right A-modules). But\n(M ⊗ P )∗ = P ∗ ⊗ M ∗ and results follows from projectivity of P ∗ and\nLemma 2.7.3.\n\nThe proof of the following Theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem\n2.14.6 and is left to the reader.\n\nTheorem 2.14.11. Let M be an exact module category over C. The\n7→ FunC(M1, M) and M2 7→ Fun\n(M2, M)\nmutu\nally inverse bijections of the sets of equivalence classes of exact module\n∗\nM\nmaps M1\nC\nare\ncategories over C and over C∗ .\nM\nFollowing M uger, [Mu], we will say that the categories C and (C∗ )op\nM\nare weakly Morita equivalent.\nExample 2.14.12. Let C be a finite multitensor category. Then C is\nan exact module category over C Cop.\nDefinition 2.14.13. The corresponding dual category Z(C) := CC\n∗\nCop\nis called the Drinfeld center of C.\nThis notion categorifies the notion of the center of a ring, since the\ncenter of a ring A is the ring of endomorphisms of A as an A-bimodule.\nLet M be an exact module category over C. For X, Y ∈M we have\ntwo notions of internal Hom -- with values in C and with values in\nrespectively. The following simple\n∗\nM\nC∗ , denoted by Hom and Hom\nM\nC\nconsequence of calculations in Examples 2.10.8 and 2.14.5 is very useful.\nC\nProposition 2.14.14. (\"Basic identity\") Let X, Y, Z ∈M. There is\na canonical isomorphism\nHomC (X, Y ) ⊗ Z ' ∗Hom\n∗\nM\nC (Z, X) ⊗ Y.\nProof. By Theorem 2.14.6 it is enough to find a canonical isomorphism\n∗HomC (Z, X) ⊗ Y ' Hom\n∗\nM\nC (X, Y ) ⊗ Z.\nThis isomorphism is constructed as follows. Choose an algebra A such\nthat M = ModC (A). By Example 2.10.8 the LHS is ∗(X ⊗A Z∗) ⊗ Y =\n∗(Z ⊗A ∗X)∗ ⊗ Y = (Z ⊗A ∗X) ⊗ Y . On the other hand by Example\n2.14.5 the RHS is Z ⊗A (∗X ⊗ Y ). Thus the associativity isomorphism\ngives a canonical isomorphism of the LHS and RHS. Observe that the\nisomorphism inverse to the one we constructed is the image of the\nidentity under the homomorphism\nHom(Y, Y )\nHom(Hom\n→\nC∗\nM (X, Y ) ⊗ X, Y ) →\nHom(Hom ∗\nM\nC (X, Y ) ⊗ HomC (Z, X) ⊗ Z, Y ) '\nHom(Hom (Z, X) ⊗ Hom\nC\nC∗\nM (X, Y ) ⊗ Z, Y ) '\nHom(Hom\n(X, Y ) ⊗ Z, ∗Hom (Z, X) ⊗ Y )\nC∗\nM\nC\nand thus does not depend on the choice of A.\n\nRemark 2.14.15. Following [Mu] one can construct from M a 2\ncategory with 2 objects A, B such that End(A) ∼\n= (C∗ )op\n= C, End(B) ∼\n,\nM\nHom(A, B) ∼M, and Hom(B, A)\nF unC (M, C).

      "content": "1. Monoidal categories\n1.1. The definition of a monoidal category. A good way of think\ning about category theory (which will be especially useful throughout\nthese notes) is that category theory is a refinement (or \"categorifica\ntion\") of ordinary algebra. In other words, there exists a dictionary\nbetween these two subjects, such that usual algebraic structures are\nrecovered from the corresponding categorical structures by passing to\nthe set of isomorphism classes of objects.\nFor example, the notion of a (small) category is a categorification of\nthe notion of a set. Similarly, abelian categories are a categorification\nof abelian groups 1 (which justifies the terminology).\nThis dictionary goes surprisingly far, and many important construc\ntions below will come from an attempt to enter into it a categorical\n\"translation\" of an algebraic notion.\nIn particular, the notion of a monoidal category is the categorification\nof the notion of a monoid.\nRecall that a monoid may be defined as a set C with an associative\nmultiplication operation (x, y)\nx\ny (i.e., a semigroup), with an\n→\n·\nelement 1 such that 12 = 1 and the maps 1\n1 : C\nC are bijections.\n·, ·\n→\nIt is easy to show that in a semigroup, the last condition is equivalent\nto the usual unit axiom 1 x = x 1 = x.\n·\n·\nAs usual in category theory, to categorify the definition of a monoid,\nwe should replace the equalities in the definition of a monoid (namely,\nthe associativity equation (xy)z = x(yz) and the equation 12 = 1)\nby isomorphisms satisfying some consistency properties, and the word\n\"bijection\" by the word \"equivalence\" (of categories). This leads to\nthe following definition.\nDefinition 1.1.1. A monoidal category is a quintuple (C, ⊗, a, 1, ι)\nwhere C is a category, ⊗ : C × C →C is a bifunctor called the tensor\nproduct\nbifunctor,\n→- ⊗ (- ⊗-) is a functorial isomorphism:\na : - ⊗ (- ⊗-) -\n∼\n(1.1.1)\naX,Y,Z : (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z\n∼X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z),\nX, Y, Z ∈C\n-→\ncalled the associativity constraint (or associativity isomorphism), 1 ∈C\nis an object of C, and ι : 1 ⊗ 1\n1 is an isomorphism, subject to the\n→\nfollowing two axioms.\n1To be more precise, the set of isomorphism classes of objects in a (small) abelian\ncategory C is a commutative monoid, but one usually extends it to a group by\nconsidering \"virtual objects\" of the form X - Y , X, Y ∈C.\n\nt\n* *\n\no o\n1. The pentagon axiom. The diagram\n(1.1.2)\niiiiiiiiiiii\n((\nii\nW\nii ⊗ X) ⊗ Y )U⊗UUZ\nUUUUUUUUUUUUU\naW ⊗X,Y,Z\naW,X,Y ⊗IdZ\n(W ⊗ X) ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)\n(W ⊗ (X ⊗ Y )) ⊗ Z\naW,X,Y ⊗Z\naW,X⊗Y,Z\nW ⊗ (X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z))\nIdW ⊗aX,Y,Z\nW ⊗ ((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z)\nis commutative for all objects W, X, Y, Z in C.\n2. The unit axiom. The functors L1 and R1 of left and right\nmultiplication by 1 are equivalences C →C.\nThe pair (1, ι) is called the unit object of C. 2\nWe see that the set of isomorphism classes of objects in a small\nmonoidal category indeed has a natural structure of a monoid, with\nmultiplication ⊗ and unit 1. Thus, in the categorical-algebraic dic\ntionary, monoidal categories indeed correspond to monoids (which ex\nplains their name).\nDefinition 1.1.2. A monoidal subcategory of a monoidal category\n(C, ⊗, a, 1, ι) is a quintuple (D, ⊗, a, 1, ι), where D ⊂C is a subcate\ngory closed under the tensor product of objects and morphisms and\ncontaining 1 and ι.\nDefinition 1.1.3. The opposite monoidal category Cop to C is the cate\ngory C with reversed order of tensor product and inverted associativity\nsomorphism.\nRemark 1.1.4. The notion of the opposite monoidal category is not\nto be confused with the usual notion of the opposite category, which is\nthe category C∨ obtained from C by reversing arrows (for any category\nC). Note that if C is monoidal, so is C∨ (in a natural way), which makes\nit even easier to confuse the two notions.\n1.2. Basic properties of unit objects in monoidal categories.\nLet (C, ⊗, a, 1, ι) be a monoidal category. Define the isomorphism lX :\n1 ⊗ X\nX by the formula\n→\nlX = L-\n1((ι ⊗ Id) * a-\n1,\n1,X ),\nand the isomorphism rX : X ⊗ 1\nX by the formula\n→\nrX = R1\n-1((Id ⊗ ι) * aX,1,1).\n2We note that there is no condition on the isomorphism ι, so it can be chosen\narbitrarily.\n\n' '\nw\n/ /\n* *\nt\n\n4 4\nO O\nj\njjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\ntjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\nThis gives rise to functorial isomorphisms l : L1\nIdC and r : R1\n→\n→\nIdC . These isomorphisms are called the unit constraints or unit iso\nmorphisms. They provide the categorical counterpart of the unit ax\niom 1X = X1 = X of a monoid in the same sense as the associativity\nisomorphism provides the categorical counterpart of the associativity\nequation.\nProposition 1.2.1. The \"triangle\" diagram\naX,1,Y\n(1.2.1)\n(X ⊗ 1) ⊗ Y\n� X ⊗ (1 ⊗ Y )\nOOOOOOOOOOO\nooooooooooo\nrX ⊗IdY\nIdX ⊗lY\nX ⊗ Y\nis commutative for all X, Y ∈C. In particular, one has r1 = l1 = ι.\nProof. This follows by applying the pentagon axiom for the quadruple\nof objects X, 1, 1, Y . More specifically, we have the following diagram:\n(1.2.2)\n((X ⊗ 1) ⊗ 1) ⊗ Y\naX,1,1⊗Id\n(X ⊗ (1 ⊗ 1)) ⊗ Y\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\njjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\nrX ⊗Id⊗Id\n(Id⊗ι)⊗Id\n(X ⊗ 1) ⊗ Y\naX⊗1,1,Y\naX,1,Y\naX,1⊗1,Y\nX ⊗ (1 ⊗ Y )\nrX ⊗Id\n(X ⊗ 1) ⊗ (1 ⊗ Y )\naX,1,1⊗Y\n�\nId⊗(ι⊗Id)\nId⊗l1⊗Y\nX ⊗ ((1 ⊗ 1) ⊗ Y )\nId⊗a1,1,Y\nX ⊗ (1 ⊗ (1 ⊗ Y ))\nTo prove the proposition, it suffices to establish the commutativity\nof the bottom left triangle (as any object of C is isomorphic to one of\nthe form 1 ⊗ Y ). Since the outside pentagon is commutative (by the\npentagon axiom), it suffices to establish the commutativity of the other\nparts of the pentagon. Now, the two quadrangles are commutative due\nto the functoriality of the associativity isomorphisms, the commutativ\nity of the upper triangle is the definition of r, and the commutativity\nof the lower right triangle is the definition of l.\nThe last statement is obtained by setting X = Y = 1 in (1.2.1).\n\n' '\nw\n' '\nw\n\n4 4\nO O\nj\njjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\ntjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\nProposition 1.2.2.

Consider the diagram\n(1.2.5)\n((X ⊗ 1) ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z\naX,1,Y ⊗Id\n� (X ⊗ (1 ⊗ Y )) ⊗ Z\n(rX ⊗Id)⊗Id\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\njjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj\n�\n(Id⊗lY )⊗Id\n(X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z\naX⊗1,Y,Z\naX,Y,Z\naX,1⊗Y,Z\nX ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)\nrX ⊗Id\n(X ⊗ 1) ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)\naX,1,Y ⊗Z\n�\nId⊗(lY ⊗Id)\nId⊗lY ⊗Z\nX ⊗ ((1 ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z)\nId⊗a1,Y,Z\nX ⊗ (1 ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z))\nwhere X, Y, Z are objects in C. The outside pentagon commutes by\nthe pentagon axiom (1.1.2). The functoriality of a implies the com\nmutativity of the two middle quadrangles. The triangle axiom (1.2.1)\nimplies the commutativity of the upper triangle and the lower left tri\nangle. Consequently, the lower right triangle commutes as well. Setting\nX = 1 and applying the functor L-\n1 to the lower right triangle, we\nobtain commutativity of the triangle (1.2.3). The commutativity of the\ntriangle (1.2.4) is proved similarly.\n\nProposition 1.2.3. For any object X in C one has the equalities\nl1⊗X = Id ⊗ lX and rX⊗1 = rX ⊗ Id.\n\n/ /\n\n/ /\n\nProof. It follows from the functoriality of l that the following diagram\ncommutes\n(1.2.6)\n1 ⊗ (1 ⊗ X)\nId⊗lX\n1 ⊗ X\nlX\nl1⊗X\n1 ⊗ X\n� X\nlX\nSince lX is an isomorphism, the first identity follows. The second iden\ntity follows similarly from the functoriality of r.\n\nProposition 1.2.4. The unit object in a monoidal category is unique\nup to a unique isomorphism.\nProof. Let (1, ι), (10, ι0) be two unit objects. Let (r, l), (r0, l0) be the\ncorresponding unit constraints. Then we have the isomorphism η :=\nl10 * (r1\n0 )-1 : 1 → 10.\nIt is easy to show using commutativity of the above triangle diagrams\nthat η maps ι to ι0. It remains to show that η is the only isomorphism\nwith this property. To do so, it suffices to show that if b : 1\n1 is an\n→\nisomorphism such that the diagram\n(1.2.7)\n1 ⊗ 1\nb⊗b / 1 ⊗ 1\nι\nι\n� 1\nb\nis commutative, then b = Id. To see this, it suffices to note that for\nany morphism c : 1\n1 the diagram\n→\n(1.2.8)\n1 ⊗ 1\nc⊗Id 1 ⊗ 1\nι\nι\n� 1\nc\nis commutative (as ι = r1), so b ⊗ b = b ⊗ Id and hence b = Id.\n\nExercise 1.2.5. Verify the assertion in the proof of Proposition 1.2.4\nthat η maps ι to ι0.\nHint. Use Propositions 1.2.1 and 1.2.2.\nThe results of this subsection show that a monoidal category can be\nalternatively defined as follows:\nDefinition 1.2.6. A monoidal category is a sextuple (C, ⊗, a, 1, l, r)\nsatisfying the pentagon axiom (1.1.2) and the triangle axiom (1.2.1).\n\nThis definition is perhaps more traditional than Definition 1.1.1, but\nDefinition 1.1.1 is simpler. Besides, Proposition 1.2.4 implies that for\na triple (C, ⊗, a) satisfying a pentagon axiom (which should perhaps\nbe called a \"semigroup category\", as it categorifies the notion of a\nsemigroup), being a monoidal category is a property and not a structure\n(similarly to how it is for semigroups and monoids).\nFurthermore, one can show that the commutativity of the triangles\nimplies that in a monoidal category one can safely identify 1 ⊗ X and\nX ⊗ 1 with X using the unit isomorphisms, and assume that the unit\nisomorphism are the identities (which we will usually do from now on).3\nIn a sense, all this means that in constructions with monoidal cat\negories, unit objects and isomorphisms always \"go for the ride\", and\none need not worry about them especially seriously. For this reason,\nbelow we will typically take less care dealing with them than we have\ndone in this subsection.\nProposition 1.2.7. ([SR, 1.3.3.1]) The monoid End(1) of endomor\nphisms of the unit object of a monoidal category is commutative.\nProof. The unit isomorphism ι : 1 ⊗ 1\n∼1 induces the isomorphism\n-→\nψ : End(1⊗1)\n∼End(1). It is easy to see that ψ(a⊗1) = ψ(1⊗a) = a\n-→\nfor any a ∈ End(1). Therefore,\n(1.2.9)\nab = ψ((a ⊗ 1)(1 ⊗ b)) = ψ((1 ⊗ b)(a ⊗ 1)) = ba,\nfor any a, b ∈ End(1).\n\n1.3. First examples of monoidal categories. Monoidal categories\nare ubiquitous. You will see one whichever way you look. Here are\nsome examples.\nExample 1.3.1. The category Sets of sets is a monoidal category,\nwhere the tensor product is the Cartesian product and the unit object\nis a one element set; the structure morphisms a, ι, l, r are obvious. The\nsame holds for the subcategory of finite sets, which will be denoted\nby Sets 4 . This example can be widely generalized: one can take the\ncategory of sets with some structure, such as groups, topological spaces,\netc.\nExample 1.3.2. Any additive category is monoidal, with ⊗ being the\ndirect sum functor ⊕, and 1 being the zero object.\nThe remaining examples will be especially important below.\n3We will return to this issue later when we discuss MacLane's coherence theorem.\n4Here and below, the absence of a finiteness condition condition is indicated by\nthe boldface font, while its presence is indicated by the Roman font.\n\nExample 1.3.3. Let k be any field. The category k - Vec of all\nk-vector spaces is a monoidal category, where ⊗ = ⊗k, 1 = k, and the\nmorphisms a, ι, l, r are the obvious ones. The same is true about the\ncategory of finite dimensional vector spaces over k, denoted by k - Vec.\nWe will often drop k from the notation when no confusion is possible.\nMore generally, if R is a commutative unital ring, then replacing k\nby R we can define monoidal categories R - mod of R-modules and\nR - mod of R-modules of finite type.\nExample 1.3.4. Let G be a group. The category Repk(G) of all\nrepresentations of G over k is a monoidal category, with ⊗ being the\ntensor product of representations: if for a representation V one denotes\nby ρV the corresponding map G\nGL(V ), then\n→\nρV ⊗W (g) := ρV (g) ⊗ ρW (g).\nThe unit object in this category is the trivial representation 1 = k. A\nsimilar statement holds for the category Repk(G) of finite dimensional\nrepresentations of G. Again, we will drop the subscript k when no\nconfusion is possible.\nExample 1.3.5. Let G be an affine (pro)algebraic group over k. The\ncategories Rep(G) of all algebraic representations of G over k is a\nmonoidal category (similarly to Example 1.3.4).\nSimilarly, if g is a Lie algebra over k, then the category of its repre\nsentations Rep(g) and the category of its finite dimensional represen\ntations Rep(g) are monoidal categories: the tensor product is defined\nby\nρV ⊗W (a) = ρV (a) ⊗ IdW + IdV ⊗ ρW (a)\n(where ρY : g\ngl(Y ) is the homomorphism associated to a represen\n→\ntation Y of g), and 1 is the 1-dimensional representation with the zero\naction of g.\nExample 1.3.6. Let G be a monoid (which we will usually take to\nbe a group), and let A be an abelian group (with operation written\nmultiplicatively). Let CG = CG(A) be the category whose objects δg\nare labeled by elements of G (so there is only one object in each iso\nmorphism class), Hom(δg1 , δg2 ) = ∅ if g1 =6\ng2, and Hom(δg, δg) = A,\nwith the functor ⊗ defined by δg ⊗ δh = δgh, and the tensor tensor\nproduct of morphisms defined by a ⊗ b = ab. Then CG is a monoidal\ncategory with the associativity isomorphism being the identity, and 1\nbeing the unit element of G. This shows that in a monoidal category,\nX ⊗ Y need not be isomorphic to Y ⊗ X (indeed, it suffices to take a\nnon-commutative monoid G).\n\nThis example has a \"linear\" version. Namely, let k be a field, and\nk - VecG denote the category of G-graded vector spaces over k, i.e.\nvector spaces V with a decomposition V = ⊕g∈GVg. Morphisms in this\ncategory are linear operators which preserve the grading. Define the\ntensor product on this category by the formula\n(V ⊗ W )g = ⊕x,y∈G:xy=gVx ⊗ Wy,\nand the unit object 1 by 11 = k and 1g = 0 for g = 1. Then,\ndefining a, ι in an obvious way, we equip k - VecG with the structure\nof a monoidal category. Similarly one defines the monoidal category\nk - VecG of finite dimensional G-graded k-vector spaces.\nIn the category k - VecG, we have pairwise non-isomorphic objects\nδg, g ∈ G, defined by the formula (δg)x = k if x = g and (δg)x =\n0 otherwise. For these objects, we have δg\n= δgh. Thus the\n⊗ δh ∼\ncategory CG(k×) is a (non-full) monoidal subcategory of k -VecG. This\nsubcategory can be viewed as a \"basis\" of VecG (and VecG as \"the linear\nspan\" of CG), as any object of VecG is isomorphic to a direct sum of\nobjects δg with nonnegative integer multiplicities.\nWhen no confusion is possible, we will denote the categories k-VecG,\nk - VecG simply by VecG, VecG.\nExample 1.3.7. This is really a generalization of Example 1.3.6, which\nshows that the associativity isomorphism is not always \"the obvious\none\".\nLet G be a group, A an abelian group, and ω be a 3-cocycle of G\nwith values in A. This means that ω : G × G × G\nA is a function\n→\nsatisfying the equation\n(1.3.1)\nω(g1g2, g3, g4)ω(g1, g2, g3g4) = ω(g1, g2, g3)ω(g1, g2g3, g4)ω(g2, g3, g4),\nfor all g1, g2, g3, g4 ∈ G.\nLet us define the monoidal category Cω = Cω (A) as follows. As a\nG\nG\ncategory, it is the same as the category CG defined above. The bifunctor\n⊗ and the unit object (1, ι) in this category is also the same as those\nin CG. The only difference is in the new associativity isomorphism aω ,\nwhich is not \"the obvious one\" (i.e., the identity) like in CG, but rather\nis defined by the formula\n(1.3.2)\na ω\nδg ,δh,δm = ω(g, h, m) : (δg ⊗ δh) ⊗ δm\nδg ⊗ (δh ⊗ δm),\n→\nwhere g, h, m ∈ G.\nThe fact that Cω with these structures is indeed a monoidal category\nG\nfollows from the properties of ω. Namely, the pentagon axiom (1.1.2)\nfollows from equation (1.3.1), and the unit axiom is obvious.\n\nSimilarly, for a field k, one can define the category (k-)Vecω , which\nG\ndiffers from VecG just by the associativity isomorphism. This is done\nby extending the associativity isomorphism of Cω by additivity to ar-\nG\nbitrary direct sums of objects δg. This category contains a monoidal\nsubcategory Vecω of finite dimensional G-graded vector spaces with\nG\nassociativity defined by ω.\nRemark 1.3.8. It is straightforward to verify that the unit morphisms\nl, r in Vecω are given on 1-dimensional spaces by the formulas\nG\nlδg = ω(1, 1, g)-1Idg, rδg = ω(g, 1, 1)Idg,\nand the triangle axiom says that ω(g, 1, h) = ω(g, 1, 1)ω(1, 1, h). Thus,\nwe have lX = rX = Id if and only if\n(1.3.3)\nω(g, 1, 1) = ω(1, 1, g),\nfor any g ∈ G or, equivalently,\n(1.3.4)\nω(g, 1, h) = 1, g, h ∈ G.\nA cocycle satisfying this condition is said to be normalized.\nExample 1.3.9. Let C be a category. Then the category End(C) of\nall functors from C to itself is a monoidal category, where ⊗ is given\nby composition of functors. The associativity isomorphism in this cat\negory is the identity. The unit object is the identity functor, and the\nstructure morphisms are obvious. If C is an abelian category, the same\nis true about the categories of additive, left exact, right exact, and\nexact endofunctors of C.\nExample 1.3.10. Let A be an associative ring with unit. Then the\ncategory A - bimod of bimodules over A is a monoidal category, with\ntensor product ⊗ = ⊗A, over A. The unit object in this category is\nthe ring A itself (regarded as an A-bimodule).\nIf A is commutative, this category has a full monoidal subcategory\nA - mod, consisting of A-modules, regarded as bimodules in which\nthe left and right actions of A coincide. More generally, if X is a\nscheme, one can define the monoidal category QCoh(X) of quasico\nherent sheaves on X; if X is affine and A = OX , then QCoh(X) =\nA - mod.\nSimilarly, if A is a finite dimensional algebra, we can define the\nmonoidal category A-bimod of finite dimensional A-bimodules. Other\nsimilar examples which often arise in geometry are the category Coh(X)\nof coherent sheaves on a scheme X, its subcategory VB(X) of vector\nbundles (i.e., locally free coherent sheaves) on X, and the category\nLoc(X) of locally constant sheaves of finite dimensional k-vector spaces\n\n(also called local systems) on any topological space X. All of these are\nmonoidal categories in a natural way.\nExample 1.3.11. The category of tangles.\nLet Sm,n be the disjoint union of m circles R/Z and n intervals\n[0, 1]. A tangle is a piecewise smooth embedding f : Sm,n → R2 × [0, 1]\nsuch that the boundary maps to the boundary and the interior to the\ninterior. We will abuse the terminology by also using the term \"tangle\"\nfor the image of f.\nLet x, y, z be the Cartesian coordinates on R2 × [0, 1]. Any tangle\nhas inputs (points of the image of f with z = 0) and outputs (points of\nthe image of f with z = 1). For any integers p, q ≥ 0, let Tep,q be the set\nof all tangles which have p inputs and q outputs, all having a vanishing\ny-coordinate. Let Tp,q be the set of isotopy classes of elements of Tep,q;\nthus, during an isotopy, the inputs and outputs are allowed to move\n(preserving the condition y = 0), but cannot meet each other. We can\ndefine a canonical composition map Tp,q × Tq,r → Tp,r, induced by the\nconcatenation of tangles. Namely, if s ∈ Tp,q and t ∈ Tq,r, we pick rep\nresentatives se ∈ Tep,q, et ∈ Teq,r such that the inputs of et coincide with the\noutputs of se, concatenate them, perform an appropriate reparametriza\ntion, and rescale z\nz/2. The obtained tangle represents the desired\n→\ncomposition ts.\nWe will now define a monoidal category T called the category of\ntangles (see [K, T, BaKi] for more details). The objects of this cat\negory are nonnegative integers, and the morphisms are defined by\nHomT (p, q) = Tp,q, with composition as above. The identity morphisms\nare the elements idp ∈ Tp,p represented by p vertical intervals and no\ncircles (in particular, if p = 0, the identity morphism idp is the empty\ntangle).\nNow let us define the monoidal structure on the category T . The\ntensor product of objects is defined by m⊗n = m+n. However, we also\nneed to define the tensor product of morphisms. This tensor product\nis induced by union of tangles. Namely, if t1 ∈ Tp1,q1 and t2 ∈ Tp2,q2 , we\npick representatives te1 ∈ Tep1,q1 , te2 ∈ Tep2,q2 in such a way that any point\nof te1 is to the left of any point of te2 (i.e., has a smaller x-coordinate).\nThen t1 ⊗ t2 is represented by the tangle te1 ∪ te2.\nWe leave it to the reader to check the following:\n1. The product t1 ⊗ t2 is well defined, and its definition makes ⊗ a\nbifunctor.\n2. There is an obvious associativity isomorphism for ⊗, which turns\nT into a monoidal category (with unit object being the empty tangle).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.769 Topics in Lie Theory: Tensor Categories\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Now we pass to categorification of morphisms between monoids,\nnamely monoidal functors.\nDefinition 1.4.1. Let (C, ⊗, 1, a, ι) and (C0, ⊗0, 10, a0, ι0) be two monoidal\ncategories.

It is important to stress that, as seen from this defini\ntion, a monoidal functor is not just a functor between monoidal cate\ngories, but a functor with an additional structure (the isomorphism J)\nsatisfying a certain equation (the monoidal structure axiom). As we\nwill see later, this equation may have more than one solution, so the\nsame functor can be equipped with different monoidal structures.\nIt turns out that if F is a monoidal functor, then there is a canon\nical isomorphism φ : 10\nF (1). This isomorphism is defined by the\ncommutative diagram\nl0\n10 ⊗0 F (1)\nF (1)\nF (1)\n---→\n(1.4.2)\nφ⊗0IdF (X)\nF (l1 )\nJ1,1\n---→ F (1 ⊗ 1)\nF (1) ⊗0 F (1)\nwhere l, r, l0, r0 are the unit isomorphisms for C, C0 defined in Subsection\n1.2.\n\nProposition 1.4.3.

Prove Proposition 1.4.3.\nProposition 1.4.3 implies that a monoidal functor can be equivalently\ndefined as follows.\nDefinition 1.4.5. A monoidal functor C →C0 is a triple (F, J, φ) which\nsatisfies the monoidal structure axiom and Proposition 1.4.3.\nThis is a more traditional definition of a monoidal functor.\nRemark 1.4.6. It can be seen from the above that for any monoidal\nfunctor (F, J) one can safely identify 10 with F (1) using the isomor\nphism φ, and assume that F (1) = 10 and φ = Id (similarly to how we\nhave identified 1 ⊗ X and X ⊗ 1 with X and assumed that lX = rX =\nIdX ). We will usually do so from now on. Proposition 1.4.3 implies\nthat with these conventions, one has\n(1.4.5)\nJ1,X = JX,1 = IdX .\nRemark 1.4.7. It is clear that the composition of monoidal functors is\na monoidal functor. Also, the identity functor has a natural structure\nof a monoidal functor.\n1.5. Morphisms of monoidal functors. Monoidal functors between\ntwo monoidal categories themselves form a category. Namely, one has\nthe following notion of a morphism (or natural transformation) between\ntwo monoidal functors.\n\nDefinition 1.5.1. Let (C, ⊗, 1, a, ι) and (C0, ⊗0, 10, a0, ι0) be two monoidal\ncategories, and (F 1, J1), (F 2, J2) two monoidal functors from C to\nC0. A morphism (or a natural transformation) of monoidal functors\nη : (F 1, J1)\n(F 2, J2) is a natural transformation η : F 1\nF 2 such\n→\n→\nthat η1 is an isomorphism, and the diagram\nJ1\nX,Y\nF 1(X) ⊗0 F 1(Y ) ---→ F 1(X ⊗ Y )\n⏐⏐y\n⏐⏐y\n(1.5.1)\nηX ⊗0ηY\nηX⊗Y\nJ2\nX,Y\nF 2(X) ⊗0 F 2(Y ) ---→ F 2(X ⊗ Y )\nis commutative for all X, Y ∈C.\nRemark 1.5.2. It is easy to show that η1 * φ1 = φ2 , so if one makes\nthe convention that φi = Id, one has η1 = Id.\nRemark 1.5.3. It is easy to show that if F : C →C0 is an equivalence\nof monoidal categories, then there exists a monoidal equivalence F -1 :\nC0 →C such that the functors F * F -1 and F -1 * F are isomorphic\nto the identity functor as monoidal functors. Thus, for any monoidal\ncategory C, the monoidal auto-equivalences of C up to isomorphism\nform a group with respect to composition.\n1.6. Examples of monoidal functors. Let us now give some exam\nples of monoidal functors and natural transformations.\nExample 1.6.1. An important class of examples of monoidal functors\nis forgetful functors (e.g. functors of \"forgetting the structure\", from\nthe categories of groups, topological spaces, etc., to the category of\nsets). Such functors have an obvious monoidal structure. An example\nimportant in these notes is the forgetful functor RepG\nVec from\n→\nthe representation category of a group to the category of vector spaces.\nMore generally, if H ⊂ G is a subgroup, then we have a forgetful\n(or restriction) functor RepG\nRepH . Still more generally, if f :\n→\nH\nG is a group homomorphism, then we have the pullback functor\n→\nf ∗ : RepG → RepH . All these functors are monoidal.\nExample 1.6.2. Let f : H\nG be a homomorphism of groups. Then\n→\nany H-graded vector space is naturally G-graded (by pushforward of\ngrading). Thus we have a natural monoidal functor f∗ : VecH\nVecG.\n→\nIf G is the trivial group, then f is just the forgetful functor VecH\n∗\n→\nVec.\nExample 1.6.3. Let A be a k-algebra with unit, and C = A - mod\nbe the category of left A-modules. Then we have a functor F : A -\n\nbimod\nEnd(C) given by F (M) = M⊗A. This functor is naturally\n→\nmonoidal. A similar functor F : A - bimod\nEnd(C). can be defined\n→\nif A is a finite dimensional k-algebra, and C = A - mod is the category\nof finite dimensional left A-modules.\nProposition 1.6.4. The functor F : A-bimod\nEnd(C) takes values\n→\nin the full monoidal subcategory Endre(C) of right exact endofunctors of\nC, and defines an equivalence between monoidal categories A - bimod\nand Endre(C)\nProof. The first statement is clear, since the tensor product functor\nis right exact. To prove the second statement, let us construct the\nquasi-inverse functor F -1 . Let G ∈ Endre(C). Define F -1(G) by the\nformula F -1(G) = G(A); this is clearly an A-bimodule, since it is a\nleft A-module with a commuting action EndA(A) = Aop (the opposite\nalgebra). We leave it to the reader to check that the functor F -1 is\nindeed quasi-inverse to F .\n\nRemark 1.6.5. A similar statement is valid without the finite dimen\nsionality assumption, if one adds the condition that the right exact\nfunctors must commute with inductive limits.\nExample 1.6.6. Let S be a monoid, and C = VecS , and IdC the identity\nfunctor of C. It is easy to see that morphisms η : IdC → IdC correspond\nto homomorphisms of monoids: η : S\nk (where k is equipped with\n→\nthe multiplication operation). In particular, η(s) may be 0 for some s,\nso η does not have to be an isomorphism.\nω\n1.7. Monoidal functors between categories CG. Let G1, G2 be\ngroups, A an abelian group, and ωi ∈ Z3(Gi, A), i = 1, 2 be 3-cocycles.\nωi\nLet Ci = CGi , i = 1, 2 (see Example 1.3.7).\nAny monoidal functor F : C1 →C2 defines, by restriction to simple\nobjects, a group homomorphism f : G1 → G2. Using the axiom (1.4.1)\nof a monoidal functor we see that a monoidal structure on F is given\nby\n(1.7.1)\nJg,h = μ(g, h)Idδf (gh) : F (δg) ⊗ F (δh)\n∼F (δgh), g, h ∈ G1,\n-→\nwhere μ : G1 × G1 → A is a function such that\nω1(g, h, l)μ(gh, l)μ(g, h) = μ(g, hl)μ(h, l)ω2(f(g), f(h), f(l)),\nfor all g, h, l ∈ G1. That is,\n(1.7.2)\nf ∗ω2 = ω1∂2(μ),\ni.e., ω1 and f ∗ω2 are cohomologous in Z3(G1, A).\n\nConversely, given a group homomorphism f : G1\nG2, a function\n→\nμ : G1 × G1\nA satisfying (1.7.2) gives rise to a monoidal functor\n→\nF : C1 →C2 defined by F (δg) = δf(g) with the monoidal structure\ngiven by formula (1.7.1). This functor is an equivalence if and only if\nf is an isomorphism.\nTo summarize, monoidal functors Cω1 →Cω2 correspond to pairs\nG1\nG2\n(f, μ), where f : G1\nG2 is a group homomorphism such that ω1\n→\nand f ∗ω2 are cohomologous, and μ is a function satisfying (1.7.2) (such\nfunctions are in a (non-canonical) bijection with A-valued 2-cocycles\non G1). Let Ff,μ denote the corresponding functor.\nLet us determine natural monoidal transformations between Ff,μ and\nFf0,μ0 . Clearly, such a transformation exists if and only if f = f 0, is\nalways an isomorphism, and is determined by a collection of morphisms\nηg : δf (g) → δf(g) (i.e., ηg ∈ A), satisfying the equation\n(1.7.3)\nμ0(g, h)(ηg ⊗ ηh) = ηghμ(g, h)\nfor all g, h ∈ G1, i.e.,\n(1.7.4)\nμ0 = μ∂1(η).\nConversely, every function η : G1\nA satisfying (1.7.4) gives rise to\n→\na morphism of monoidal functors η : Ff,μ → Ff,μ0 defined as above.\nThus, functors Ff,μ and Ff0,μ0 are isomorphic as monoidal functors if\nand only if f = f 0 and μ is cohomologous to μ0.\nThus, we have obtained the following proposition.\nProposition 1.7.1. (i) The monoidal isomorphisms Ff,μ → Ff,μ0 of\nω1\nω2\nmonoidal functors Ff,μi : CG1 →CG2 form a torsor over the group\nH1(G1, k×) = Hom(G1, k×) of characters of G1;\n(ii) Given f, the set of μ parametrizing isomorphism classes of Ff,μ\nis a torsor over H2(G1, k×);\n(iii) The structures of a monoidal category on (CG, ⊗) are parametrized\nby H3(G, k×)/Out(G), where Out(G) is the group of outer automor\nphisms of G. 5\nRemark 1.7.2. The same results, including Proposition 1.7.1, are\nvalid if we replace the categories Cω by their \"linear spans\" Vecω , and\nG\nG\nrequire that the monoidal functors we consider are additive. To see\nthis, it is enough to note that by definition, for any morphism η of\nmonoidal functors, η1 6= 0, so equation (1.7.3) (with h = g-1) implies\n5Recall that the group Inn(G) of inner automorphisms of a group G acts trivially\non H∗(G, A) (for any coefficient group A), and thus the action of the group Aut(G)\non H∗(G, A) factors through Out(G).\n\nthat all ηg must be nonzero. Thus, if a morphism η : Ff,μ\nFf0,μ0\n→\nexists, then it is an isomorphism, and we must have f = f 0.\nRemark 1.7.3. The above discussion implies that in the definition\nof the categories Cω and Vecω it may be assumed without loss of\nG\nG,\ngenerality that the cocycle ω is normalized, i.e., ω(g, 1, h) = 1, and\nthus lδg = rδg = Id (which is convenient in computations). Indeed, we\nclaim that any 3-cocycle ω is cohomologous to a normalized one. To\nsee this, it is enough to alter ω by dividing it by ∂2μ, where μ is any\n2-cochain such that μ(g, 1) = ω(g, 1, 1), and μ(1, h) = ω(1, 1, h)-1 .\nExample 1.7.4. Let G = Z/nZ where n > 1 is an integer, and k = C.\nConsider the cohomology of Z/nZ.\nSince Hi(Z/nZ, C) = 0 for all i > 0, writing the long exact sequence\nof cohomology for the short exact sequence of coefficient groups\n0 -→ Z -→ C -→ C× = C/Z -→ 0,\nwe obtain a natural isomorphism Hi(Z/nZ, C×) ∼= Hi+1(Z/nZ, Z).\nIt is well known [Br] that the graded ring H∗(Z/nZ, Z) is (Z/nZ)[x]\nwhere x is a generator in degree 2. Moreover, as a module over Aut(Z/nZ) =\n(Z/nZ)×, we have H2(Z/nZ, Z) ∼\nThere\n= H1(Z/nZ, C×) = (Z/nZ)∨.\nfore, using the graded ring structure, we find that H2m(Z/nZ, Z) ∼=\nH2m-1(Z/nZ, C×) = ((Z/nZ)∨)⊗m as an Aut(Z/nZ)-module. In par\nticular, H3(Z/nZ, C×) = ((Z/nZ)∨)⊗2 .\nThis consideration shows that if n = 2 then the categorification\nproblem has 2 solutions (the cases of trivial and non-trivial cocycle),\nwhile if n is a prime greater than 2 then there are 3 solutions: the trivial\ncocycle, and two non-trivial cocycles corresponding (non-canonically)\nto quadratic residues and non-residues mod n.\nLet us give an explicit formula for the 3-cocycles on Z/nZ. Modulo\ncoboundaries, these cocycles are given by\nsi(j+k-(j+k)0)\n(1.7.5)\nφ(i, j, k) = ε\nn\n,\nwhere ε is a primitive nth root of unity, s ∈ Z/nZ, and for an integer\nm we denote by m0 the remainder of division of m by n.\nExercise 1.7.5. Show that when s runs over Z/nZ this formula defines\ncocycles representing all cohomology classes in H3(Z/nZ, C×).\n1.8. MacLane's strictness theorem. As we have seen above, it is\nmuch simpler to work with monoidal categories in which the associa\ntivity and unit constrains are the identity maps.\nDefinition 1.8.1. A monoidal category C is strict if for all objects\nX, Y, Z in C one has equalities (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z = X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z) and\n\nX ⊗ 1 = X = 1 ⊗ X, and the associativity and unit constraints are the\nidentity maps.\nExample 1.8.2. The category End(C) endofunctors of a category C is\nstrict.\nExample 1.8.3. Let Sets be the category whose objects are nonnega\ntive integers, and Hom(m, n) is the set of maps from {0, ..., m - 1} to\n{0, ..., n - 1}. Define the tensor product functor on objects by m⊗n =\nmn, and for f1 : m1 → n1, f2 : m2 → n2, define f1 ⊗ f2 : m1m2 → n1n2\nby\n(f1 ⊗ f2)(m2x + y) = n2f1(x) + f2(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ m1 - 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ m2 - 1.\nThen Sets is a strict monoidal category. Moreover, we have a natural\ninclusion Sets ,\nSets, which is obviously a monoidal equivalence.\n→\nExample 1.8.4. This is really a linear version of the previous example.\nLet k-Vec be the category whose objects are nonnegative integers, and\nHom(m, n) is the set of matrices with m columns and n rows over some\nfield k (and the composition of morphisms is the product of matrices).\nDefine the tensor product functor on objects by m ⊗ n = mn, and for\nf1 : m1\nn1, f2 : m2\nn2, define f1 ⊗ f2 : m1m2\nn1n2 to be the\n→\n→\n→\nKronecker product of f1 and f2. Then k - Vec is a strict monoidal\ncategory. Moreover, we have a natural inclusion k - Vec ,\nk - Vec,\n→\nwhich is obviously a monoidal equivalence.\nSimilarly, for any group G one can define a strict monoidal category\nk - VecG, whose objects are Z+-valued functions on G with finitely\nmany nonzero values, and which is monoidally equivalent to k - VecG.\nWe leave this definition to the reader.\nOn the other hand, some of the most important monoidal categories,\nsuch as Sets, Vec, VecG, Sets, Vec, VecG, should be regarded as non-\nstrict (at least if one defines them in the usual way). It is even more\nindisputable that the categories Vecω , Vecω for cohomologically non-\nG\nG\ntrivial ω are not strict.\nHowever, the following remarkable theorem of MacLane implies that\nin practice, one may always assume that a monoidal category is strict.\nTheorem 1.8.5. Any monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a\nstrict monoidal category.\nProof. The proof presented below was given in [JS]. We will establish\nan equivalence between C and the monoidal category of right C-module\nendofunctors of C, which we will discuss in more detail later. The non-\ncategorical algebraic counterpart of this result is of course the fact that\n\nu\n) )\n\n/ /\n\n/ /\nevery monoid M is isomorphic to the monoid consisting of maps from\nM to itself commuting with the right multiplication.\nFor a monoidal category C, let C0 be the monoidal category defined\nas follows. The objects of C are pairs (F, c) where F : C →C is a\nfunctor and\ncX,Y : F (X) ⊗ Y\n∼F (X ⊗ Y )\n-→\nis a functorial isomorphism, such that the following diagram is com\nmutative for all objects X, Y, Z in C:\n(1.8.1)\nkkkkkkkkkkk\n(\nk\nF\nkk (X) ⊗ Y ) ⊗SSZ\nSSSSSSSSSSSSS\ncX,Y ⊗IdZ\naF (X),Y,Z\nF (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z\nF (X) ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)\ncX⊗Y ,Z\ncX,Y ⊗Z\nF ((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z)\n� F (X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)).\nF (aX,Y,Z )\nA morphism θ : (F 1, c1) → (F 2, c2) in C0 is a natural transformation\nθ : F 1\nF 2 such that the following square commutes for all objects\n→\nX, Y in C:\nc\n(1.8.2)\nF 1(X) ⊗ Y\nX,Y F 1(X ⊗ Y )\nθX ⊗IdY\nθX⊗Y\nF2(X) ⊗ Y\nF 2(X ⊗ Y )\ncX,Y\nComposition of morphisms is the vertical composition of natural trans\nformations.\nThe tensor product of objects is given by (F 1, c1) ⊗\n(F 2, c2) = (F 1F 2, c) where c is given by a composition\ncF2(X),Y\nF1(cX,Y )\n(1.8.3) F 1F 2(X) ⊗ Y ----→ F 1(F 2(X) ⊗ Y ) - ---→ F 1F 2(X ⊗ Y )\nfor all X, Y ∈C, and the tensor product of morphisms is the horizontal\ncomposition of natural transformations. Thus C0 is a strict monoidal\ncategory (the unit object is the identity functor).\nConsider now the functor of left multiplication L : C →C0 given by\nL(X) = (X ⊗-, aX,-, ), L(f) = f ⊗-.\n-\nNote that the diagram (1.8.1) for L(X) is nothing but the pentagon\ndiagram (1.1.2).\nWe claim that this functor L is a monoidal equivalence.\n\nFirst of all, L essentially surjective: it is easy to check that for any\n(F, c) ∈C0, (F, c) is isomorphic to L(F (1)).\nLet us now show that L is fully faithful. Let θ\nL(X)\nL(Y ) be a\n:\n(1.8.4)\nX\nX\nY\nY.\n-→\n⊗\n-\n⊗\n-→\n→\nWe claim that for all Z in\none has θ\nf Id\n(so that θ\nL(f) and\nC\n⊗\n=\n=\nZ\nZ\nL is full). Indeed, this follows from the commutativity of the diagram\n-\nId\n⊗\nId\nl\nr\na\nZ\n⊗\nX,1,Z\nX\nZ\nX\nZ\n(X\n1)\nZ\nX\nZ\n⊗\n----→\n⊗\n⊗\n----→\n⊗⏐⏐y\n→\nmorphism in C.

Thus L is faithful.\nFinally, we define a monoidal functor structure JX,Y : L(X) L(Y )\n∼\n*\n-→\nL(X ⊗ Y ) on L by\nJX,Y = a-1\n- : X ⊗ (Y ⊗-), ((IdX ⊗ aY,\n-) * aX,Y ⊗-,-)\nX,Y,\n-,\n∼\n).\n-→ ((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗-, aX⊗Y,-,-\nThe diagram (1.8.2) for the latter natural isomorphism is just the pen\ntagon diagram in C. For the functor L the hexagon diagram (1.4.1)\nin the definition of a monoidal functor also reduces to the pentagon\ndiagram in C. The theorem is proved.\n\nRemark 1.8.6. The nontrivial nature of MacLane's strictness theo\nrem is demonstrated by the following instructive example, which shows\nthat even though a monoidal category is always equivalent to a strict\ncategory, it need not be isomorphic to one. (By definition, an iso\nmorphism of monoidal categories is a monoidal equivalence which is an\nisomorphism of categories).\nω\nNamely, let C be the category CG. If ω is cohomologically nontrivial,\nthis category is clearly not isomorphic to a strict one. However, by\nMaclane's strictness theorem, it is equivalent to a strict category C0.\nIn fact, in this example a strict category C0 monoidally equivalent\nto C can be constructed quite explicitly, as follows. Let Ge be another\n\ngroup with a surjective homomorphism f : Ge\nG such that the 3\ncocycle f ∗ω is cohomologically trivial. Such Ge\n→\nalways exists, e.g., a\nfree group (recall that the cohomology of a free group in degrees higher\nthan 1 is trivial, see [Br]). Let C0 be the category whose objects δg\nare labeled by elements of Ge, Hom(δg, δh) = A if g, h have the same\nimage in G, and Hom(δg, δh) = ∅ otherwise. This category has an\nobvious tensor product, and a monoidal structure defined by the 3\ncocycle f ∗ω. We have an obvious monoidal functor F : C0 →C defined\nby the homomorphism Ge\nG, and it is an equivalence, even though\n→\nnot an isomorphism. However, since the cocycle f ∗ω is cohomologically\ntrivial, the category C0 is isomorphic to the same category with the\ntrivial associativity isomorphism, which is strict.\nRemark 1.8.7. 6 A category is called skeletal if it has only one object\nin each isomorphism class. The axiom of choice implies that any cate\ngory is equivalent to a skeletal one. Also, by MacLane's theorem, any\nmonoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict one. However,\nRemark 1.8.6 shows that a monoidal category need not be monoidally\nequivalent to a category which is skeletal and strict at the same time.\nIndeed, as we have seen, to make a monoidal category strict, it may\nbe necessary to add new objects to it (which are isomorphic, but not\nequal to already existing ones). In fact, the desire to avoid adding\nsuch objects is the reason why we sometimes use nontrivial associa\ntivity isomorphisms, even though MacLane's strictness theorem tells\nus we don't have to. This also makes precise the sense in which the\ncategories Sets, Vec, VecG, are \"more strict\" than the category Vecω\nG\nfor cohomologically nontrivial ω. Namely, the first three categories\nare monoidally equivalent to strict skeletal categories Sets, Vec, VecG,\nwhile the category Vecω is not monoidally equivalent to a strict skeletal\nG\ncategory.\nExercise 1.8.8. Show that any monoidal category C is monoidally\nequivalent to a skeletal monoidal category C. Moreover, C can be chosen\nin such a way that lX , rX = IdX for all objects X ∈C.\nHint. Without loss of generality one can assume that 1 ⊗ X =\nX ⊗ 1 = X and lX , rX = IdX for all objects X ∈C. Now in every\nisomorphism class i of objects of C fix a representative Xi, so that X1 =\n1, and for any two classes i, j fix an isomorphism μij : Xi ⊗ Xj → Xi j ,\n·\nso that μi1 = μ1i = IdXi . Let C be the full subcategory of C consisting\nof the objects Xi, with tensor product defined by Xi⊗Xj = Xi j , and\n·\n6This remark is borrowed from the paper [Kup2].\n\nwith all the structure transported using the isomorphisms μij . Then C\nis the required skeletal category, monoidally equivalent to C.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.769 Topics in Lie Theory: Tensor Categories\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "1.9. The MacLane coherence theorem. In a monoidal category,\none can form n-fold tensor products of any ordered sequence of objects\nX1, ..., Xn. Namely, such a product can be attached to any parenthe\nsizing of the expression X1 ⊗...⊗Xn, and such products are, in general,\ndistinct objects of C.\nHowever, for n = 3, the associativity isomorphism gives a canonical\nidentification of the two possible parenthesizings, (X1 ⊗ X2) ⊗ X3 and\nX1 ⊗ (X2 ⊗ X3). An easy combinatorial argument then shows that one\ncan identify any two parenthesized products of X1, ..., Xn, n ≥ 3, using\na chain of associativity isomorphisms.\nWe would like to say that for this reason we can completely ignore\nparentheses in computations in any monoidal category, identifying all\npossible parenthesized products with each other. But this runs into the\nfollowing problem: for n ≥ 4 there may be two or more different chains\nof associativity isomorphisms connecting two different parenthesizings,\nand a priori it is not clear that they provide the same identification.\nLuckily, for n = 4, this is settled by the pentagon axiom, which\nstates exactly that the two possible identifications are the same. But\nwhat about n > 4?\nThis problem is solved by the following theorem of MacLane, which\nis the first important result in the theory of monoidal categories.\nTheorem 1.9.1. (MacLane's Coherence Theorem) [ML] Let X1, . . . , Xn ∈\nC. Let P1, P2 be any two parenthesized products of X1, ..., Xn (in this\norder) with arbitrary insertions of unit objects 1. Let f, g : P1\nP2\n→\nbe two isomorphisms, obtained by composing associativity and unit\nisomorphisms and their inverses possibly tensored with identity mor\nphisms. Then f = g.\nProof. We derive this theorem as a corollary of the MacLane's strictness\nTheorem 1.8.5. Let L : C →C0 be a monoidal equivalence between C\nand a strict monoidal category C0. Consider a diagram in C representing\nf and g and apply L to it. Over each arrow of the resulting diagram\nrepresenting an associativity isomorphism, let us build a rectangle as\nin (1.4.1), and do similarly for the unit morphisms. This way we obtain\na prism one of whose faces consists of identity maps (associativity and\nunit isomorphisms in C0) and whose sides are commutative. Hence, the\nother face is commutative as well, i.e., f = g.\n\nAs we mentioned, this implies that any two parenthesized products\nof X1, ..., Xn with insertions of unit objects are indeed canonically iso\nmorphic, and thus one can safely identify all of them with each other\n\nand ignore bracketings in calculations in a monoidal category. We will\ndo so from now on, unless confusion is possible.\n1.10. Rigid monoidal categories. Let (C, ⊗, 1, a, ι) be a monoidal\ncategory, and let X be an object of C. In what follows, we suppress\nthe unit morphisms l, r.\nDefinition 1.10.1. A right dual of an object X in C is an object X∗\nin C equipped with morphisms evX : X∗ ⊗ X → 1 and coevX : 1 →\nX ⊗ X∗, called the evaluation and coevaluation morphisms, such that\nthe compositions\n(1.10.1)\nX\ncoevX ⊗IdX\naX,X∗,X X ⊗ (X∗ ⊗ X)\nIdX ⊗evX\n------→ (X ⊗ X∗) ⊗ X ----→\n-----→ X,\n(1.10.2)\na-1\nX∗ IdX∗ ⊗coevX\nX∗,X,X∗\nevX ⊗IdX∗ X∗\n-------→ X∗ ⊗ (X ⊗ X∗) -----→ (X∗ ⊗ X) ⊗ X∗ - ----→\nare the identity morphisms.\nDefinition 1.10.2. A left dual of an object X in C is an object ∗X in C\nequipped with morphisms ev0\nX : X ⊗ ∗X → 1 and coev0\nX : 1 → ∗X ⊗ X\nsuch that the compositions\n(1.10.3)\nIdX ⊗coev0\na-1\nX ⊗IdX\nX,∗X,X\nev0\nX\nX ------→ X ⊗ (∗X ⊗ X) ----→ (X ⊗ ∗X) ⊗ X -----→ X,\n(1.10.4)\nX ⊗Id∗X\nId∗X ⊗ev0\ncoev0\na∗X,X,∗X\nX\n∗X -------→ (∗X ⊗ X) ⊗ ∗X -----→ ∗X ⊗ (X ⊗ ∗X) - ----→ X∗\nare the identity morphisms.\nRemark 1.10.3. It is obvious that if X∗ is a right dual of an object\nX then X is a left dual of X∗ with ev0\nX∗ = evX and coev0\nX∗ = coevX ,\nand vice versa. Also, in any monoidal category, 1∗ = ∗1 = 1 with the\nstructure morphisms ι and ι-1 . Also note that changing the order of\ntensor product switches right duals and left duals, so to any statement\nabout right duals there corresponds a symmetric statement about left\nduals.\nProposition 1.10.4. If X ∈C has a right (respectively, left) dual\nobject, then it is unique up to a unique isomorphism.\nProof. Let X1\n∗, X2\n∗ be two right duals to X. Denote by e1, c1, e2, c2 the\ncorresponding evaluation and coevaluation morphisms. Then we have\n\n/ /\n\n+ +\nWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW\n/ /\n/ /\n\n/ /\n/ /\na morphism α : X1\n∗\nX2\n∗ defined as the composition\n→\nIdX∗\na-1\n,X,X∗\ne1⊗IdX∗\n1 ⊗c2\nX1\n∗\nX1\n∗ ----→ X1\n∗ ⊗ (X ⊗ X2\n∗) -----→ (X1\n∗ ⊗ X) ⊗ X2\n∗ - ---→ X2\n∗.\nSimilarly one defines a morphism β : X2\n∗\nX1\n∗. We claim that β\nα\n→\n*\nand α\nβ are the identity morphisms, so α is an isomorphism. Indeed\n*\nconsider the following diagram:\nX1\n∗\nId ⊗c1\nX1\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X1\n∗\nId\nId ⊗c2\nId ⊗c2⊗Id\nX1\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X2\n∗\nId ⊗c1 X1\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X2\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X1\n∗\nId ⊗e2⊗Id\nX1\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X1\n∗\ne1⊗Id\ne1⊗Id\ne1⊗Id\nX2\n∗\nId ⊗c1\nX2\n∗ ⊗ X ⊗ X1\n∗\ne2⊗Id\nX1\n∗.\nHere we suppress the associativity constraints. It is clear that the three\nsmall squares commute. The triangle in the upper right corner com\nmutes by axiom (1.10.1) applied to X2\n∗. Hence, the perimeter of the\ndiagram commutes. The composition through the top row is the iden\ntity by (1.10.2) applied to X1\n∗. The composition through the bottom\nrow is β\nα and so β\nα = Id. The proof of α\nβ = Id is completely\n*\n*\n*\nsimilar.\nMoreover, it is easy to check that α : X1\n∗\nX2\n∗ is the only iso\n→\nmorphism which preserves the evaluation and coevaluation morphisms.\nThis proves the proposition for right duals. The proof for left duals is\nsimilar.\n\nExercise 1.10.5. Fill in the details in the proof of Proposition 1.10.4.\nIf X, Y are objects in C which have right duals X∗, Y ∗ and f : X → Y\nis a morphism, one defines the right dual f ∗ : Y ∗\nX∗ of f as the\n→\ncomposition\na-1\nY ∗ IdY ∗ ⊗coevX\nY ∗,X,X∗\n(1.10.5)\n-------→ Y ∗ ⊗ (X ⊗ X∗) -----→ (Y ∗ ⊗ X) ⊗ X∗\n(IdY ∗ ⊗f)⊗IdX∗\nevY ⊗IdX∗\n---------→ (Y ∗ ⊗ Y ) ⊗ X∗ - ----→ X∗.\nSimilarly, if X, Y are objects in C which have left duals ∗X, ∗Y and\nf : X\nY is a morphism, one defines the left dual ∗f : ∗Y\n∗X of f\n→\n→\nas the composition\nX ⊗Id∗Y\ncoev0\na∗X,X,∗Y\n(1.10.6)\n∗Y -------→ (∗X ⊗ X) ⊗ ∗Y -----→ ∗X ⊗ (X ⊗ ∗Y )\nId∗X ⊗(f⊗Id∗Y )\nId∗X ⊗ev0\nY\n---------→ ∗X ⊗ (Y ⊗ ∗Y ) - ----→ ∗X.\n\nExercise 1.10.6. Let C, D be monoidal categories. Suppose\n(F, J) : C →D\nis a monoidal functor with the corresponding isomorphism φ : 1 →\nF (1). Let X be an object in C with a right dual X∗. Prove that\nF (X∗) is a right dual of F (X) with the evaluation and coevaluation\ngiven by\nJX,X∗\nF (evX )\nevF (X) : F (X∗) ⊗ F (X) ---→ F (X∗ ⊗ X) ----→ F (1) = 1,\nJ-1\nF (coevX )\nX,X∗\ncoevF (X) : 1 = F (1) -----→ F (X ⊗ X∗) ---→ F (X) ⊗ F (X∗).\nState and prove a similar result for left duals.\nProposition 1.10.7. Let C be a monoidal category.\n(i) Let U, V, W be objects in C admitting right (respectively, left)\nduals, and let f : V\nW , g : U\nV be morphisms in C. Then\n→\n→\n(f\ng)∗ = g∗\nf ∗ (respectively, ∗(f\ng) = ∗g\n∗f).\n*\n*\n*\n*\n(ii) If U, V have right (respectively, left) duals then the object V ∗ ⊗U ∗\n(respectively, ∗V ⊗ ∗U) has a natural structure of a right (respectively,\nleft) dual to U ⊗ V .\nExercise 1.10.8. Prove Proposition 1.10.7.\nProposition 1.10.9. (i) If an object V has a right dual V ∗ then there\nare natural adjunction isomorphisms\n(1.10.7)\nHom(U ⊗ V, W )\n∼\nHom(U, W ⊗ V ∗),\n-→\n(1.10.8)\nHom(V ∗ ⊗ U, W )\n∼\nHom(U, V ⊗ W ).\n-→\nThus, the functor - ⊗ V ∗ is right adjoint to - ⊗ V and V ⊗- is right\nadjoint to V ∗ ⊗-.\n(ii) If an object V has a left dual ∗V then there are natural adjunction\nisomorphisms\n∼\n(1.10.9)\nHom(U ⊗ ∗V, W ) -→ Hom(U, W ⊗ V ),\n(1.10.10)\nHom(V ⊗ U, W )\n∼\nHom(U, ∗V ⊗ W ).\n-→\nThus, the functor -⊗ V is right adjoint to -⊗ ∗V and ∗V ⊗- is right\nadjoint to V ⊗-).\nProof. The isomorphism in (1.10.7) is given by\nf 7→ (f ⊗ IdV ∗ ) * (IdU ⊗ coevV )\nand has the inverse\ng 7→ (IdW ⊗ evV )\n(g ⊗ IdV ).\n*\n\nThe other isomorphisms are similar, and are left to the reader as an\nexercise. 7\n\nRemark 1.10.10. Proposition 1.10.9 provides another proof of Propo\nsition 1.10.4. Namely, setting U = 1 and V = X in (1.10.8), we obtain\na natural isomorphism Hom(X∗, W ) ∼Hom(1, X ⊗ W ) for any right\n=\ndual X∗ of X. Hence, if Y1, Y2 are two such duals then there is a\nnatural isomorphism Hom(Y1, W ) ∼Hom(Y2, W ), whence there is a\n=\ncanonical isomorphism Y1 ∼= Y2 by Yoneda's Lemma. The proof for left\nduals is similar.\nDefinition 1.10.11. A monoidal category C is called rigid if every\nobject X ∈C has a right dual object and a left dual object.\nExample 1.10.12. The category Vec of finite dimensional k-vector\nspaces is rigid: the right and left dual to a finite dimensional vector\nspace V are its dual space V ∗, with the evaluation map evV : V ∗ ⊗V →\nk being the contraction, and the coevaluation map coevV : k → V ⊗V ∗\nbeing the usual embedding. On the other hand, the category Vec of\nall k-vector spaces is not rigid, since for infinite dimensional spaces\nthere is no coevaluation maps (indeed, suppose that c : k\nV ⊗ Y\n→\nis a coevaluation map, and consider the subspace V 0 of V spanned by\nthe first component of c(1); this subspace finite dimensional, and yet\nthe composition V → V ⊗ Y ⊗ V → V , which is supposed to be the\nidentity map, lands in V 0 - a contradiction).\nExample 1.10.13. The category Rep(G) of finite dimensional\nk-representations of a group G is rigid: for a finite dimensional rep\nresentation V , the (left or right) dual representation V ∗ is the usual\ndual space (with the evaluation and coevaluation maps as in Example\n1.10.12), and with the G-action given by ρV ∗ (g) = (ρV (g)-1)∗. Simi\nlarly, the category Rep(g) of finite dimensional representations of a Lie\nalgebra g is rigid, with ρV ∗ (a) = -ρV (a)∗.\nExample 1.10.14. The category VecG is rigid if and only if the monoid\nG is a group; namely, δg\n∗ = ∗δg = δg-1 (with the obvious structure\nmaps). More generally, for any group G and 3-cocycle ω ∈ Z3(G, k×),\nthe category Vecω\nG is rigid. Namely, assume for simplicity that the\ncocycle ω is normalized (as we know, we can do so without loss of\ngenerality). Then we can define duality as above, and normalize the\ncoevaluation morphisms of δg to be the identities. The evaluation mor\nphisms will then be defined by the formula evδg = ω(g, g-1, g).\n7A convenient way to do computations in this and previous Propositions is using\nthe graphical calculus (see [K, Chapter XIV]).\n\nIt follows from Proposition 1.10.4 that in a monoidal category C\nwith right (respectively, left) duals, one can define the (contravariant)\nright (respectively, left) duality functor C →C by X 7→ X∗, f 7→ f ∗\n(respectively, X 7→ ∗X, f 7→ ∗f) for every object X and morphism f in\nC. By Proposition 1.10.7(ii), these functors are anti-monoidal, in the\nsense that they define monoidal functors C∨ →Cop; hence the functors\nX\nX∗∗, X\n∗∗X are monoidal. Also, it follows from Proposition\n→\n→\n1.10.9 that the functors of right and left duality, when they are defined,\nare fully faithful (it suffices to use (i) for U = X∗, V = Y, W = 1).\nMoreover, it follows from Remark 1.10.3 that in a rigid monoidal cat\negory, the functors of right and left duality are mutually quasi-inverse\nmonoidal equivalences of categories C∨ →Cop (so for rigid categories,\nthe two notions of opposite category are the same up to equivalence).\nThis implies that the functors X\nX∗∗, X\n∗∗X are mutually\n→\n→\nquasi-inverse monoidal autoequivalences. We will see later in Example\n1.27.2 that these autoequivalences may be nontrivial; in particular, it\nis possible that objects V ∗ and ∗V are not isomorphic.\nExercise 1.10.15. Show that if C, D are rigid monoidal categories,\nF1, F2 : C →D are monoidal functors, and η : F1 → F2 is a morphism\nof monoidal functors, then η is an isomorphism.8\nExercise 1.10.16. Let A be an algebra. Show that M ∈ A - bimod\nhas a left (respectively, right) dual if and only if it is finitely generated\nprojective when considered as a left (respectively, right) A-module.\nSinilarly, if A is commutative, M ∈ A - mod has a left and right dual\nif and only if it is finitely generated projective.\n1.11. Invertible objects. Let C be a rigid monoidal category.\nDefinition 1.11.1. An object X in C is invertible if evX : X∗ ⊗X → 1\nand coevX : 1 → X ⊗ X∗ are isomorphisms.\nClearly, this notion categorifies the notion of an invertible element\nin a monoid.\nExample 1.11.2. The objects δg in Vecω are invertible.\nG\nProposition 1.11.3. Let X be an invertible object in C. Then\n(i) ∗X ∼= X∗ and X∗ is invertible;\n(ii) if Y is another invertible object then X ⊗ Y is invertible.\nProof. Dualizing coevX and evX we get isomorphisms X ⊗ ∗X = 1\n∼\nand ∗X ⊗ X ∼1.\n=\n=\nIn any rigid\n=\nHence ∗X ∼∗X ⊗ X ⊗ X∗ ∼X∗.\ncategory the evaluation and coevaluation morphisms for ∗X can be\n8As we have seen in Remark 1.6.6, this is false for non-rigid categories.\n\ndefined by ev∗X := ∗coevX and coev∗X := ∗evX , so ∗X is invertible.\nThe second statement follows from the fact that evX⊗Y can be defined\nas a composition of evX and evY and similarly coevX⊗Y can be defined\nas a composition of coevY and coevX .\n\nProposition 1.11.3 implies that invertible objects of C form a monoidal\nsubcategory Inv(C) of C.\nExample 1.11.4. Gr-categories. Let us classify rigid monoidal cat\negories C where all objects are invertible and all morphisms are iso\nmorphisms. We may assume that C is skeletal, i.e. there is only one\nobject in each isomorphism class, and objects form a group G. Also,\nby Proposition 1.2.7, End(1) is an abelian group; let us denote it by\nA. Then for any g ∈ G we can identify End(g) with A, by sending\nf ∈ End(g) to f ⊗ Idg-1 ∈ End(1) = A. Then we have an action of G\non A by\na ∈ End(1) 7→ g(a) := Idg ⊗ a ∈ End(g).\nLet us now consider the associativity isomorphism. It is defined by a\nfunction ω : G × G × G\nA. The pentagon relation gives\n→\n(1.11.1)\nω(g1g2, g3, g4)ω(g1, g2, g3g4) = ω(g1, g2, g3)ω(g1, g2g3, g4)g1(ω(g2, g3, g4)),\nfor all g1, g2, g3, g4 ∈ G, which means that ω is a 3-cocycle of G with\ncoefficients in the (generally, nontrivial) G-module A. We see that any\nsuch 3-cocycle defines a rigid monoidal category, which we will call\nCω (A). The analysis of monoidal equivalences between such categories\nG\nis similar to the case when A is a trivial G-module, and yields that\nfor a given group G and G-module A, equivalence classes of Cω are\nG\nparametrized by H3(G, A)/Out(G).\nCategories of the form Cω (A) are called Gr-categories, and were stud-\nG\nied in [Si].\n1.12. Tensor and multitensor categories. Now we will start con\nsidering monoidal structures on abelian categories. For the sake of\nbrevity, we will not recall the basic theory of abelian categories; let us\njust recall the Freyd-Mitchell theorem stating that abelian categories\ncan be characterized as full subcategories of categories of left modules\nover rings, which are closed under taking direct sums, as well as ker\nnels, cokernels, and images of morphisms. This allows one to visualize\nthe main concepts of the theory of abelian categories in terms of the\nclassical theory of modules over rings.\nRecall that an abelian category C is said to be k-linear (or defined\nover k) if for any X, Y in C, Hom(X, Y ) is a k-vector space, and com\nposition of morphisms is bilinear.\n\nDefinition 1.12.1. A k-linear abelian category is said to be locally\nfinite if it is essentially small9, and the following two conditions are\nsatisfied:\n(i) for any two objects X, Y in C, the space Hom(X, Y ) is finite\ndimensional;\n(ii) every object in C has finite length.\nAlmost all abelain categories we will consider will be locally finite.\nProposition 1.12.2. In a locally finite abelian category C, Hom(X, Y ) =\n0 if X, Y are simple and non-isomorphic, and Hom(X, X) = k for any\nsimple object X.\nProof. Recall Schur's lemma: if X, Y are simple objects of an abelian\ncategory, and f ∈ Hom(X, Y ), then f = 0 or f is an isomorphism. This\nimplies that Hom(X, Y ) = 0 if X, Y are simple and non-isomorphic,\nand Hom(X, X) is a division algebra; since k is algebraically closed,\ncondition (i) implies that Hom(X, X) = k for any simple object X ∈\nC.\n\nAlso, the Jordan-H older and Krull-Schmidt theorems hold in any\nlocally finite abelian category C.\nDefinition 1.12.3. Let C be a locally finite k-linear abelian rigid\nmonoidal category. We will call C a multitensor category over k if\nthe bifunctor ⊗ is bilinear on morphisms. If in addition End(1) ∼k\n=\nthen we will call C a tensor category.\nA multifusion category is a semisimple multitensor category with\nfinitely many isomorphism simple objects. A fusion category is a semisim\nple tensor category with finitely many isomorphism simple objects.\nExample 1.12.4. The categories Vec of finite dimensional k-vector\nspaces, Rep(G) of finite dimensional k-representations of a group G\n(or algebraic representations of an affine algebraic group G), Rep(g)\nof finite dimensional representations of a Lie algebra g, and Vecω of\nG\nG-graded finite dimensional k-vector spaces with associativity defined\nby a 3-cocycle ω are tensor categories. If G is a finite group, Rep(G)\nis a fusion category. In particular, Vec is a fusion category.\nExample 1.12.5. Let A be a finite dimensional semisimple algebra\nover k. Let A-bimod be the category of finite dimensional A-bimodules\nwith bimodule tensor product over A, i.e.,\n(M, N) 7→ M ⊗A N.\n9Recall that a category is called essentially small if its isomorphism classes of\nobjects form a set.\n\nThen C is a multitensor category with the unit object 1 = A, the left\ndual defined by M 7→ Hom(AM, AA), and the right dual defined by\nM 7→ Hom(MA, AA).10 The category C is tensor if and only if A is\nsimple, in which case it is equivalent to k - Vec. More generally, if\nA has n matrix blocks, the category C can be alternatively described\nas the category whose objects are n-by-n matrices of vector spaces,\nV = (Vij ), and the tensor product is matrix multiplication:\n(V ⊗ W )il = ⊕j\nn\n=1Vij ⊗ Wjl.\nThis category will be denoted by Mn(Vec). It is a multifusion category.\nIn a similar way, one can define the multitensor category Mn(C) of\nn-by-n matrices of objects of a given multitensor category C. If C is a\nmultifusion category, so is Mn(C).\n10Note that if A is a finite dimensional non-semisimple algebra then the category\nof finite dimensional A-bimodules is not rigid, since the duality functors defined as\nabove do not satisfy rigidity axioms (cf. Exercise 1.10.16).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.769 Topics in Lie Theory: Tensor Categories\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "1.13. Exactness of the tensor product.\nProposition 1.13.1. (see [BaKi, 2.1.8]) Let C be a multitensor cate\ngory. Then the bifunctor ⊗ : C × C →C is exact in both factors (i.e.,\nbiexact).\nProof. The proposition follows from the fact that by Proposition 1.10.9,\nthe functors V ⊗ and ⊗V have left and right adjoint functors (the\nfunctors of tensoring with the corresponding duals), and any functor\nbetween abelian categories which has a left and a right adjoint functor\nis exact.\n\nRemark 1.13.2. The proof of Proposition 1.13.1 shows that the bi\nadditivity of the functor ⊗ holds automatically in any rigid monoidal\nabelian category. However, this is not the case for bilinearity of ⊗,\nand thus condition of bilinearity of tensor product in the definition of\na multitensor category is not redundant.\nThis may be illustrated by the following example. Let C be the\ncategory of finite dimensional C-bimodules in which the left and right\nactions of R coincide. This category is C-linear abelian; namely, it is\nsemisimple with two simple objects C+ = 1 and C-, both equal to\nC as a real vector space, with bimodule structures (a, b)z = azb and\n(a, b)z = azb, respectively. It is also also rigid monoidal, with ⊗ being\nthe tensor product of bimodules. But the tensor product functor is not\nC-bilinear on morphisms (it is only R-bilinear).\nDefinition 1.13.3. A multiring category over k is a locally finite k-\nlinear abelian monoidal category C with biexact tensor product. If in\naddition End(1) = k, we will call C a ring category.\nThus, the difference between this definition and the definition of a\n(multi)tensor category is that we don't require the existence of duals,\nbut instead require the biexactness of the tensor product. Note that\nProposition 1.13.1 implies that any multitensor category is a multiring\ncategory, and any tensor category is a ring category.\nCorollary 1.13.4. For any pair of morphisms f1, f2 in a multiring\ncategory C one has Im(f1 ⊗ f2) = Im(f1) ⊗ Im(f2).\nProof. Let I1, I2 be the images of f1, f2. Then the morphisms fi : Xi →\nYi, i = 1, 2, have decompositions Xi → Ii → Yi, where the sequences\nXi → Ii → 0, 0 → Ii → Yi\nare exact. Tensoring the sequence X1 → I1 → 0 with I2, by Proposition\n1.13.1, we get the exact sequence\nX1 ⊗ I2 → I1 ⊗ I2 → 0\n\nTenosring X1 with the sequence X2\nI2\n0, we get the exact se\n→\n→\nquence\nX1 ⊗ X2 → X1 ⊗ I2 → 0.\nCombining these, we get an exact sequence\nX1 ⊗ X2 → I1 ⊗ I2 → 0.\nArguing similarly, we show that the sequence\nI1 ⊗ I2 → Y1 ⊗ Y2\n→\nis exact. This implies the statement.\n\nProposition 1.13.5. If C is a multiring category with right duals, then\nthe right dualization functor is exact. The same applies to left duals.\nProof. Let 0\nX\nY\nZ\n0 be an exact sequence. We need to\n→\n→\n→\n→\nshow that the sequence 0\nZ∗\nY ∗\nX∗\n0 is exact.

This implies that the\nsequence Z∗\nY ∗\nX∗\n0 is exact.\n\n→\n→\n→\nProposition 1.13.6. Let P be a projective object in a multiring cate\ngory C. If X ∈C has a right dual, then the object P ⊗ X is projective.\nSimilarly, if X ∈C has a left dual, then the object X ⊗ P is projective.\n\nProof. In the first case by Proposition 1.10.9 we have Hom(P ⊗X, Y ) =\nHom(P, Y ⊗X∗), which is an exact functor of Y , since the functors ⊗X∗\nand Hom(P, ) are exact. So P ⊗ X is projective. The second case is\n-\nsimilar.\n\nCorollary 1.13.7. If C multiring category with right duals, then 1 ∈C\nis a projective object if and only if C is semisimple.\nProof. If 1 is projective then for any X ∈C, X ∼= 1 ⊗ X is projective.\nThis implies that C is semisimple. The converse is obvious.\n\n1.14. Quasi-tensor and tensor functors.\nDefinition 1.14.1. Let C, D be multiring categories over k, and F :\nC →D be an exact and faithful functor.\n(i) F is said to be a quasi-tensor functor if it is equipped with a\nfunctorial isomorphism J : F ( ) ⊗ F ( )\nF (- ⊗-), and F (1) = 1.\n-\n- →\n(ii) A quasi-tensor functor (F, J) is said to be a tensor functor if J\nis a monoidal structure (i.e., satisfies the monoidal structure axiom).\nExample 1.14.2. The functors of Examples 1.6.1,1.6.2 and Subsection\n1.7 (for the categories Vecω\nG) are tensor functors. The identity functor\nVecω1\nV ecω2 for non-cohomologous 3-cocycles ω1, ω2 is not a tensor\nG\nG\n→\nfunctor, but it can be made quasi-tensor by any choice of J.\n1.15. Semisimplicity of the unit object.\nTheorem 1.15.1. In any multiring category, End(1) is a semisimple\nalgebra, so it is isomorphic to a direct sum of finitely many copies of\nk.\nProof. By Proposition 1.2.7, End(1) is a commutative algebra, so it is\nsufficient to show that for any a ∈ End(1) such that a2 = 0 we have\na = 0. Let J = Im(a). Then by Corollary 1.13.4 J ⊗ J = Im(a ⊗ a) =\nIm(a2 ⊗ 1) = 0.\nNow let K = Ker(a). Then by Corollary 1.13.4, K ⊗ J is the image\nof 1 ⊗ a on K ⊗ 1. But since K ⊗ 1 is a subobject of 1 ⊗ 1, this is the\nsame as the image of a ⊗ 1 on K ⊗ 1, which is zero. So K ⊗ J = 0.\nNow tensoring the exact sequence 0\nK\nJ\n0 with J,\n→\n→\n→\n→\nand applying Proposition 1.13.1, we get that J = 0, so a = 0.\n\nLet {pi}i∈I be the primitive idempotents of the algebra End(1). Let\n1i be the image of pi. Then we have 1 = ⊕i∈I 1i.\nCorollary 1.15.2. In any multiring category C the unit object 1 is\nisomorphic to a direct sum of pairwise non-isomorphic indecomposable\nobjects: 1 ∼= ⊕i 1i.\n\nExercise 1.15.3. One has 1i ⊗ 1j = 0 for i =6\nj. There are canonical\nisomorphisms 1i ⊗ 1i ∼\n= 1i∗.\n= 1i, and 1i ∼\nLet Cij := 1i ⊗C ⊗ 1j .\nDefinition 1.15.4. The subcategories Cij will be called the component\nsubcategories of C.\nProposition 1.15.5. Let C be a multiring category.\n(1) C = ⊕i,j∈I Cij . Thus every indecomposable object of C belongs\nto some Cij .\n(2) The tensor product maps Cij × Ckl to Cil, and it is zero unless\nj = k.\n(3) The categories Cii are ring categories with unit objects 1i (which\nare tensor categories if C is rigid).\n(3) The functors of left and right duals, if they are defined, map Cij\nto Cji.\nExercise 1.15.6. Prove Proposition 1.15.5.\nProposition 1.15.5 motivates the terms \"multiring category\" and\n\"multitensor category\", as such a category gives us multiple ring cate\ngories, respectively tensor categories Cii.\nRemark 1.15.7. Thus, a multiring category may be considered as a\n2-category with objects being elements of I, 1-morphisms from j to i\nforming the category Cij , and 2-morphisms being 1-morphisms in C.\nTheorem 1.15.8. (i) In a ring category with right duals, the unit\nobject 1 is simple.\n(ii) In a multiring category with right duals, the unit object 1 is\nsemisimple, and is a direct sum of pairwise non-isomorphic simple ob\njects 1i.\nProof. Clearly, (i) implies (ii) (by applying (i) to the component cate\ngories Cii). So it is enough to prove (i).\nLet X be a simple subobject of 1 (it exists, since 1 has finite length).\nLet\n(1.15.1)\n0 -→ X -→ 1 -→ Y -→ 0\nbe the corresponding exact sequence. By Proposition 1.13.5, the right\ndualization functor is exact, so we get an exact sequence\n(1.15.2)\n0 -→ Y ∗ -→ 1 -→ X∗ -→ 0.\nTensoring this sequence with X on the left, we obtain\n(1.15.3)\n0 -→ X ⊗ Y ∗ -→ X -→ X ⊗ X∗ -→ 0,\n\nP\nSince X is simple and X ⊗X∗ = 0 (because the coevaluation morphism\nis nonzero) we obtain that X ⊗ X∗ = X. So we have a surjective\n∼\ncomposition morphism 1 → X ⊗ X∗ → X. From this and (1.15.1) we\nhave a nonzero composition morphism 1 X ,\n1. Since End(1) = k,\nthis morphism is a nonzero scalar, whence X =\n→\n1.\n\nCorollary 1.15.9. In a ring category with right duals, the evaluation\nmorphisms are surjective and the coevaluation morphisms are injective.\nExercise 1.15.10. Let C be a multiring category with right duals. and\nX ∈Cij and Y ∈Cjk be nonzero.\n(a) Show that X ⊗ Y = 0.\n(b) Deduce that length(X ⊗ Y ) ≥ length(X)length(Y ).\n(c) Show that if C is a ring category with right duals then an in\nvertible object in C is simple.\n(d) Let X be an object in a multiring category with right duals\nsuch that X ⊗ X∗ ∼\nShow that X is invertible.\n= 1.\nExample 1.15.11. An example of a ring category where the unit ob\nject is not simple is the category C of finite dimensional representations\nof the quiver of type A2. Such representations are triples (V, W, A),\nwhere V, W are finite dimensional vector spaces, and A : V\nW is a\n→\nlinear operator. The tensor product on such triples is defined by the\nformula\n(V, W, A) ⊗ (V 0, W 0, A0) = (V ⊗ V 0, W ⊗ W 0, A ⊗ A0),\nwith obvious associativity isomorphisms, and the unit object (k, k, Id).\nOf course, this category has neither right nor left duals.\n1.16. Grothendieck rings. Let C be a locally finite abelian category\nover k. If X and Y are objects in C such that Y is simple then we denote\nby [X : Y ] the multiplicity of Y in the Jordan-H older composition series\nof X.\nRecall that the Grothendieck group Gr(C) is the free abelian group\ngenerated by isomorphism classes Xi, i ∈ I of simple objects in C,\nand that to every object X in C we can canonically associate its class\n[X] ∈ Gr(C) given by the formula [X] =\n[X : Xi]Xi. It is obvious\ni\nthat if\n0 -→ X -→ Y -→ Z -→ 0\nthen [Y ] = [X] + [Z]. When no confusion is possible, we will write X\ninstead of [X].\n\nX\nX\nX\nNow let C be a multiring category. The tensor product on C induces\na natural multiplication on Gr(C) defined by the formula\nXiXj := [Xi ⊗ Xj ] =\n[Xi ⊗ Xj : Xk]Xk.\nk∈I\nLemma 1.16.1. The above multiplication on Gr(C) is associative.\nProof. Since the tensor product functor is exact,\n[(Xi ⊗ Xj ) ⊗ Xp : Xl] =\n[Xi ⊗ Xj : Xk][Xk ⊗ Xp : Xl].\nk\nOn the other hand,\n[Xi ⊗ (Xj ⊗ Xp) : Xl] =\n[Xj ⊗ Xp : Xk][Xi ⊗ Xk : Xl].\nk\nThus the associativity of the multiplication follows from the isomor\nphism (Xi ⊗ Xj ) ⊗ Xp ∼= Xi ⊗ (Xj ⊗ Xp).\n\nThus Gr(C) is an associative ring with the unit 1. It is called the\nGrothendieck ring of C.\nThe following proposition is obvious.\nProposition 1.16.2. Let C and D be multiring categories and F : C →\nD be a quasi-tensor functor. Then F defines a homomorphism of unital\nrings [F ] : Gr(C)\nGr(D).\n→\nThus, we see that (multi)ring categories categorify rings (which jus\ntifies the terminology), while quasi-tensor (in particular, tensor) func\ntors between them categorify unital ring homomorphisms. Note that\nProposition 1.15.5 may be regarded as a categorical analog of the Peirce\ndecomposition in classical algebra.\n1.17. Groupoids. The most basic examples of multitensor categories\narise from finite groupoids. Recall that a groupoid is a small category\nwhere all morphisms are isomorphisms. Thus a groupoid G entails a set\nX of objects of G and a set G of morphisms of G, the source and target\nmaps s, t : G\nX, the composition map μ : G ×X G\nG (where the\n→\n→\nfibered product is defined using s in the first factor and using t in the\nsecond factor), the unit morphism map u : X\nG, and the inversion\n→\nmap i : G\nG satisfying certain natural axioms, see e.g. [Ren] for\n→\nmore details.\nHere are some examples of groupoids.\n(1) Any group G is a groupoid G with a single object whose set of\nmorphisms to itself is G.\n\nM\n(2) Let X be a set and let G = X × X. Then the product groupoid\nG(X) := (X, G) is a groupoid in which s is the first projection,\nt is the second projection, u is the diagonal map, and i is the\npermutation of factors. In this groupoid for any x, y ∈ X there\nis a unique morphism from x to y.\n(3) A more interesting example is the transformation groupoid T (G, X)\narising from the action of a group G on a set X. The set\nof objects of T (G, X) is X, and arrows correspond to triples\n(g, x, y) where y = gx with an obvious composition law. In\nother words, the set of morphisms is G × X and s(g, x) =\nx, t(g, x) = gx, u(x) = (1, x), i(g, x) = (g-1, gx).\nLet G = (X, G, μ, s, t, u, i) be a finite groupoid (i.e., G is finite) and let\nC(G) be the category of finite dimensional vector spaces graded by the\nset G of morphisms of G, i.e., vector spaces of the form V = ⊕g∈G Vg.\nIntroduce a tensor product on C(G) by the formula\n(1.17.1)\n(V ⊗ W )g =\nVg1 ⊗ Wg2 .\n(g1,g2):g1g2=g\nThen C(G) is a multitensor category. The unit object is 1 = ⊕x∈X 1x,\nwhere 1x is a 1-dimensional vector space which sits in degree idx in G.\nThe left and right duals are defined by (V ∗)g = (∗V )g = Vg-1 .\nWe invite the reader to check that the component subcategories\nC(G)xy are the categories of vector spaces graded by Mor(y, x).\nWe see that C(G) is a tensor category if and only if G is a group,\nwhich is the case of VecG already considered in Example 1.3.6. Note\nalso that if X = {1, ..., n} then C(G(X)) is naturally equivalent to\nMn(Vec).\nExercise 1.17.1. Let Ci be isomorphism classes of objects in a finite\ngroupoid G, ni = |Ci|, xi ∈ Ci be representatives of Ci, and Gi =\nAut(xi) be the corresponding automorphism groups. Show that C(G)\nis (non-canonically) monoidally equivalent to ⊕iMni (VecGi ).\nRemark 1.17.2. The finite length condition in Definition 1.12.3 is\nnot superfluous: there exists a rigid monoidal k-linear abelian category\nwith bilinear tensor product which contains objects of infinite length.\nAn example of such a category is the category C of Jacobi matrices of\nfinite dimensional vector spaces. Namely, the objects of C are semi-\ninfinite matrices V = {Vij }ij∈Z+ of finite dimensional vector spaces Vij\nwith finitely many non-zero diagonals, and morphisms are matrices of\nlinear maps. The tensor product in this category is defined by the\n\nX\nformula\n(1.17.2)\n(V ⊗ W )il =\nVij ⊗ Wjl,\nj\nand the unit object 1 is defined by the condition 1ij = kδij . The left\nand right duality functors coincide and are given by the formula\n(1.17.3)\n(V ∗)ij = (Vji)∗.\nThe evaluation map is the direct sum of the canonical maps Vij\n∗ ⊗Vij →\n1jj , and the coevaluation map is a direct sum of the canonical maps\n1ii → Vij ⊗ Vij\n∗.\nNote that the category C is a subcategory of the category C0 of G(Z+)\ngraded vector spaces with finite dimensional homogeneous components.\nNote also that the category C0 is not closed under the tensor product\ndefined by (1.17.2) but the category C is.\nExercise 1.17.3.\n(1) Show that if X is a finite set then the group\nof invertible objects of the category C(G(X)) is isomorphic to\nAut(X).\n(2) Let C be the category of Jacobi matrices of vector spaces from\nExample 1.17.2. Show that the statement Exercise 1.15.10(d)\nfails for C. Thus the finite length condition is important in\nExercise 1.15.10.\n1.18. Finite abelian categories and exact faithful functors.\nDefinition 1.18.1. A k-linear abelian category C is said to be finite if\nit is equivalent to the category A - mod of finite dimensional modules\nover a finite dimensional k-algebra A.\nOf course, the algebra A is not canonically attached to the category\nC; rather, C determines the Morita equivalence class of A. For this\nreason, it is often better to use the following \"intrinsic\" definition,\nwhich is well known to be equivalent to Definition 1.18.1:\nDefinition 1.18.2. A k-linear abelian category C is finite if\n(i) C has finite dimensional spaces of morphisms;\n(ii) every object of C has finite length;\n(iii) C has enough projectives, i.e., every simple object of C has a\nprojective cover; and\n(iv) there are finitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects.\nNote that the first two conditions are the requirement that C be\nlocally finite.\nIndeed, it is clear that if A is a finite dimensional algebra then A -\nmod clearly satisfies (i)-(iv), and conversely, if C satisfies (i)-(iv), then\n\none can take A = End(P )op, where P is a projective generator of C (e.g.,\nP = ⊕i\nn\n=1Pi, where Pi are projective covers of all the simple objects\nXi).\nA projective generator P of C represents a functor F = FP : C → Vec\nfrom C to the category of finite dimensional k-vector spaces, given by\nthe formula F (X) = Hom(P, X). The condition that P is projective\ntranslates into the exactness property of F , and the condition that\nP is a generator (i.e., covers any simple object) translates into the\nproperty that F is faithful (does not kill nonzero objects or morphisms).\nMoreover, the algebra A = End(P )op can be alternatively defined as\nEnd(F ), the algebra of functorial endomorphisms of F . Conversely,\nit is well known (and easy to show) that any exact faithful functor\nF : C → Vec is represented by a unique (up to a unique isomorphism)\nprojective generator P .\nNow let C be a finite k-linear abelian category, and F1, F2 : C → Vec\nbe two exact faithful functors. Define the functor F1 ⊗F2 : C×C → Vec\nby (F1 ⊗ F2)(X, Y ) := F1(X) ⊗ F2(Y ).\nProposition 1.18.3. There is a canonical algebra isomorphism αF1,F2 :\nEnd(F1) ⊗ End(F2) ∼= End(F1 ⊗ F2) given by\nαF1,F2 (η1 ⊗ η2)|F1(X)⊗F2(Y ) := η1|F1(X) ⊗ η2|F2(Y ),\nwhere ηi ∈ End(Fi), i = 1, 2.\nExercise 1.18.4. Prove Proposition 1.18.3.\n1.19. Fiber functors. Let C be a k-linear abelian monoidal category.\nDefinition 1.19.1. A quasi-fiber functor on\nis an exact faithful\nC\nfunctor F : C → Vec from C to the category of finite dimensional\nk-vector spaces, such that F (1) = k, equipped with an isomorphism\nJ : F ( ) ⊗ F ( )\nF (- ⊗-). If in addition J is a monoidal structure\n-\n- →\n(i.e. satisfies the monoidal structure axiom), one says that F is a fiber\nfunctor.\nExample 1.19.2. The forgetful functors VecG → Vec, Rep(G)\nVec\nare naturally fiber functors, while the forgetful functor Vecω →\nVec\nG →\nis quasi-fiber, for any choice of the isomorphism J (we have seen that\nif ω is cohomologically nontrivial, then Vecω does not admit a fiber\nG\nfunctor). Also, the functor Loc(X)\nVec on the category of local\n→\nsystems on a connected topological space X which attaches to a local\nsystem E its fiber Ex at a point x ∈ X is a fiber functor, which justifies\nthe terminology. (Note that if X is Hausdorff, then this functor can be\nidentified with the abovementioned forgetful functor Rep(π1(X, x)) →\nVec).\n\nX\nExercise 1.19.3. Show that if an abelian monoidal category C admits\na quasi-fiber functor, then it is a ring category, in which the object 1\nis simple. So if in addition C is rigid, then it is a tensor category.\n1.20. Coalgebras.\nDefinition 1.20.1. A coalgebra (with counit) over a field k is a k-vector\nspace C together with a comultiplicaton (or coproduct) Δ : C\nC ⊗C\n→\nand counit ε : C\nk such that\n→\n(i) Δ is coassociative, i.e.,\n(Δ ⊗ Id) Δ = (Id ⊗ Δ) Δ\n*\n*\nas maps C\nC⊗3;\n→\n(ii) one has\n(ε ⊗ Id) Δ = (Id ⊗ ε) Δ = Id\n*\n*\nas maps C\nC (the \"counit axiom\").\n→\nDefinition 1.20.2. A left comodule over a coalgebra C is a vector\nspace M together with a linear map π : M\nC ⊗ M (called the\n→\ncoaction map), such that for any m ∈ M, one has\n(Δ ⊗ Id)(π(m)) = (Id ⊗ π)(π(m)), (ε ⊗ Id)(π(m)) = m.\nSimilarly, a right comodule over C is a vector space M together with\na linear map π : M\nM ⊗ C, such that for any m ∈ M, one has\n→\n(π ⊗ Id)(π(m)) = (Id ⊗ Δ)(π(m)), (Id ⊗ ε)(π(m)) = m.\nFor example, C is a left and right comodule with π = Δ, and so is\nk, with π = ε.\nExercise 1.20.3. (i) Show that if C is a coalgebra then C∗ is an\nalgebra, and if A is a finite dimensional algebra then A∗ is a coalgebra.\n(ii) Show that for any coalgebra C, any (left or right) C-comodule\nM is a (respectively, right or left) C∗-module, and the converse is true\nif C is finite dimensional.\nExercise 1.20.4.

This\nalgebra has two additional structures: the comultiplication Δ : H →\nH ⊗ H and the counit ε : H\nk. Namely, the comultiplication is\n→\ndefined by the formula\nΔ(a) = α-1 Δ(a)),\nF,F\nwhere eΔ(a) ∈ End(F ⊗ F ) is given by\ne\nX,Y aX⊗Y JX,Y ,\nΔ(a)X,Y = J-1\nand the counit is defined by the formula\nε(a) = a1 ∈ k.\nTheorem 1.21.1. (i) The algebra H is a coalgebra with comultiplica\ntion Δ and counit ε.\n(ii) The maps Δ and ε are unital algebra homomorphisms.\nProof. The coassociativity of Δ follows form axiom (1.4.1) of a monoidal\nfunctor. The counit axiom follows from (1.4.3) and (1.4.4). Finally, ob\nserve that for all η, ν ∈ End(F ) the images under αF,F of both Δ(η)Δ(ν)\nand Δ(ην) have components J-1 (ην)X⊗Y JX,Y ; hence, Δ is an algebra\nX,Y\nhomomorphism (which is obviously unital). The fact that ε is a unital\nalgebra homomorphism is clear.\n\nDefinition 1.21.2. An algebra H equipped with a comultiplication Δ\nand a counit ε satisfying properties (i),(ii) of Theorem 1.21.1 is called\na bialgebra.\nThus, Theorem 1.21.1 claims that the algebra H = End(F ) has a\nnatural structure of a bialgebra.\nNow let H be any bialgebra (not necessarily finite dimensional).\nThen the category Rep(H) of representations (i.e., left modules) of\nH and its subcategory Rep(H) of finite dimensional representations\nof H are naturally monoidal categories (and the same applies to right\nmodules). Indeed, one can define the tensor product of two H-modules\nX, Y to be the usual tensor product of vector spaces X ⊗ Y , with the\naction of H defined by the formula\nρX⊗Y (a) = (ρX ⊗ ρY )(Δ(a)), a ∈ H\n(where ρX : H\nEnd(X), ρY : H\nEnd(Y )), the associativity iso\n→\n→\nmorphism to be the obvious one, and the unit object to be the 1\ndimensional space k with the action of H given by the counit, a\nε(a).\n→\nMoreover, the forgetful functor Forget : Rep(H)\nVec is a fiber func\n→\ntor.\n\nP\nP\nX\nThus we see that one has the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.21.3. The assignments (C, F ) 7→ H = End(F ), H 7→\n(Rep(H), Forget) are mutually inverse bijections between\n1) finite abelian k-linear monoidal categories C with a fiber functor\nF , up to monoidal equivalence and isomorphism of monoidal functors;\n2) finite dimensional bialgebras H over k up to isomorphism.\nProof. Straightforward from the above.\n\nTheorem 1.21.3 is called the reconstruction theorem for finite dimen\nsional bialgebras (as it reconstructs the bialgebra H from the category\nof its modules using a fiber functor).\nExercise 1.21.4. Show that the axioms of a bialgebra are self-dual\nin the following sense: if H is a finite dimensional bialgebra with\nmultiplication μ : H ⊗ H\nH, unit i : k\nH, comultiplication\n→\n→\nΔ : H → H ⊗ H and counit ε : H → k, then H∗ is also a bialgebra,\nwith the multiplication Δ∗, unit ε∗, comultiplication μ∗, and counit i∗.\nExercise 1.21.5. (i) Let G be a finite monoid, and C = VecG. Let\nF : C → Vec be the forgetful functor. Show that H = End(F ) is the\nbialgebra Fun(G, k) of k-valued functions on G, with comultiplication\nΔ(f)(x, y) = f(xy) (where we identify H ⊗ H with Fun(G × G, k)),\nand counit ε(f) = f(1).\n(ii) Show that Fun(G, k)∗ = k[G], the monoid algebra of G (with\nbasis x ∈ G and product x y = xy), with coproduct Δ(x) = x ⊗x, and\n·\ncounit ε(x) = 1, x ∈ G. Note that the bialgebra k[G] may be defined\nfor any G (not necessarily finite).\nExercise 1.21.6. Let H be a k-algebra, C = H -mod be the category\nof H-modules, and F : C → Vec be the forgetful functor (we don't\nassume finite dimensionality). Assume that C is monoidal, and F is\ngiven a monoidal structure J. Show that this endows H with the\nstructure of a bialgebra, such that (F, J) defines a monoidal equivalence\nC → Rep(H).\nNote that not only modules, but also comodules over a bialgebra H\nform a monoidal category. Indeed, for a finite dimensional bialgebra,\nthis is clear, as right (respectively, left) modules over H is the same\nthing as left (respectively, right) comodules over H∗. In general, if\nX, Y are, say, right H-comodules, then the right comodule X ⊗ Y is\nthe usual tensor product of X, Y with the coaction map defined as\nfollows: if x ∈ X, y ∈ Y , π(x) =\nxi ⊗ ai, π(y) =\nyj ⊗ bj , then\nπX⊗Y (x ⊗ y) =\nxi ⊗ yj ⊗ aibj .\n\nFor a bialgebra H, the monoidal category of right H-comodules will\nbe denoted by H - comod, and the subcategory of finite dimensional\ncomodules by H - comod.\n1.22. Hopf algebras. Let us now consider the additional structure\non the bialgebra H = End(F ) from the previous subsection in the case\nwhen the category C has right duals. In this case, one can define a\nlinear map S : H\nH by the formula\n→\nS(a)X = a∗\nX∗ ,\nwhere we use the natural identification of F (X)∗ with F (X∗).\nProposition 1.22.1. (\"the antipode axiom\") Let μ : H ⊗ H\nH and\n→\ni : k\nH be the multiplication and the unit maps of H. Then\n→\nμ (Id ⊗ S) Δ = i\nε = μ (S ⊗ Id) Δ\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nas maps H\nH.\n→\nProof. For any b ∈ End(F ⊗F ) the linear map μ*(Id⊗S)(α-1 (b))X , X ∈\nF,F\nC is given by\n(1.22.1)\ncoevF (X)\nbX,X∗\nevF (X)\nF (X) -----→ F (X)⊗F (X)∗⊗F (X) ---→ F (X)⊗F (X)∗⊗F (X) ---→ F (X),\nwhere we suppress the identity isomorphisms, the associativity con\nstraint, and the isomorphism F (X)∗ = F (X∗). Indeed, it suffices to\n∼\ncheck (1.22.1) for b = η ⊗ ν, where η, ν ∈ H, which is straightforward.\nNow the first equality of the proposition follows from the commuta\ntivity of the diagram\ncoevF (X)\n(1.22.2)\nF (X)\n� F (X) ⊗ F (X)∗ ⊗ F (X)\nId\nJX,X∗\nF (coevX )\nF (X)\n� F (X ⊗ X∗) ⊗ F (X)\nη1\nηX⊗X∗\nF (coevX )\nF (X)\n� F (X ⊗ X∗) ⊗ F (X)\nJ-1\nId\nX,X∗\nevF (X)\nF (X) �\nF (X) ⊗ F (X)∗ ⊗ F (X),\nfor any η ∈ End(F ).\nNamely, the commutativity of the upper and the lower square fol\nlows from the fact that upon identification of F (X)∗ with F (X∗), the\nmorphisms evF (X) and coevF (X) are given by the diagrams of Exer\ncise 1.10.6. The middle square commutes by the naturality of η. The\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\ncomposition of left vertical arrows gives ε(η)IdF (X), while the compo\nsition of the top, right, and bottom arrows gives μ (Id ⊗ S) Δ(η).\nThe second equality is proved similarly.\n*\n*\n\nDefinition 1.22.2. An antipode on a bialgebra H is a linear map\nS : H\nH which satisfies the equalities of Proposition 1.22.1.\n→\nExercise 1.22.3. Show that the antipode axiom is self-dual in the\nfollowing sense: if H is a finite dimensional bialgebra with antipode\nSH , then the bialgebra H∗ also admits an antipode SH∗ = S∗\nH .\nThe following is a \"linear algebra\" analog of the fact that the right\ndual, when it exists, is unique up to a unique isomorphism.\nProposition 1.22.4. An antipode on a bialgebra H is unique if exists.\nProof. The proof essentially repeats the proof of uniqueness of right\ndual. Let S, S0 be two antipodes for H. Then using the antipode\nproperties of S, S0, associativity of μ, and coassociativity of Δ, we get\nS = μ * (S ⊗ [μ * (Id ⊗ S0) * Δ]) * Δ =\nμ * (Id ⊗ μ) * (S ⊗ Id ⊗ S0) * (Id ⊗ Δ) * Δ =\nμ * (μ ⊗ Id) * (S ⊗ Id ⊗ S0) * (Δ ⊗ Id) * Δ =\nμ * ([μ * (S ⊗ Id) * Δ] ⊗ S0) * Δ = S0.\nProposition 1.22.5. If S is an antipode on a bialgebra H then S is an\nantihomomorphism of algebras with unit and of coalgebras with counit.\nProof. Let\n(Δ ⊗ Id) Δ(a) = (Id ⊗ Δ) Δ(a) =\n*\n*\na ⊗ a ⊗ a i ,\ni\ni\ni\n(Δ ⊗ Id) Δ(b) = (Id ⊗ Δ) Δ(b) =\nb\n*\n*\nj ⊗ bj ⊗ b\nj\nThen using the definition of the antipode, we have\nj .\ni b)ai S(ai ) =\ni bj )ai bj S(bj )S(ai ) = S(b)S(a).\ni\ni,j\nThus S is an antihomomorphism of algebras (which is obviously unital).\nThe fact that it is an antihomomorphism of coalgebras then follows\nusing the self-duality of the axioms (see Exercises 1.21.4,1.22.3), or can\nbe shown independently by a similar argument.\n\nS(ab) =\nS(a\nS(a\n\nCorollary 1.22.6. (i) If H is a bialgebra with an antipode S, then\nthe abelian monoidal category C = Rep(H) has right duals. Namely,\nfor any object X, the right dual X∗ is the usual dual space of X, with\naction of H given by\nρX∗ (a) = ρX (S(a))∗,\nand the usual evaluation and coevaluation morphisms of the category\nVec.\n(ii) If in addition S is invertible, then C also admits left duals, i.e.\nis rigid (in other words, C is tensor category). Namely, for any object\nX, the left dual ∗X is the usual dual space of X, with action of H given\nby\nρ∗X (a) = ρX (S-1(a))∗,\nand the usual evaluation and coevaluation morphisms of the category\nVec.\nProof. Part (i) follows from the antipode axiom and Proposition 1.22.5.\nPart (ii) follows from part (i) and the fact that the operation of taking\nthe left dual is inverse to the operation of taking the right dual.\n\nRemark 1.22.7. A similar statement holds for finite dimensional co\nmodules. Namely, if X is a finite dimensional right comodule over a\nbialgebra H with an antipode, then the right dual is the usual dual X∗\nwith\n(πX∗ (f), x ⊗ φ) := ((Id ⊗ S)(πX (x)), f ⊗ φ),\nx ∈ X, f ∈ X∗, φ ∈ H∗. If S is invertible, then the left dual ∗X is\ndefined by the same formula with S replaced by S-1 .\nRemark 1.22.8. The fact that S is an antihomomorphism of coalge\nbras is the \"linear algebra\" version of the categorical fact that dualiza\ntion changes the order of tensor product (Proposition 1.10.7(ii)).\nDefinition 1.22.9. A bialgebra equipped with an invertible antipode\nS is called a Hopf algebra.\nRemark 1.22.10. We note that many authors use the term \"Hopf\nalgebra\" for any bialgebra with an antipode.\nThus, Corollary 1.22.6 states that if H is a Hopf algebra then Rep(H)\nis a tensor category. So, we get the following reconstruction theorem\nfor finite dimensional Hopf algebras.\nTheorem 1.22.11. The assignments (C, F ) 7→ H = End(F ), H 7→\n(Rep(H), Forget) are mutually inverse bijections between\n1) finite tensor categories C with a fiber functor F , up to monoidal\nequivalence and isomorphism of monoidal functors;\n\nX\nX\n2) finite dimensional Hopf algebras over k up to isomorphism.\nProof. Straightforward from the above.\n\nExercise 1.22.12. The algebra of functions Fun(G, k) on a finite\nmonoid G is a Hopf algebra if and only if G is a group. In this case,\nthe antipode is given by the formula S(f)(x) = f(x-1), x ∈ G.\nMore generally, if G is an affine algebraic group over k, then the\nalgebra O(G) of regular functions on G is a Hopf algebra, with the\ncomultiplication, counit, and antipode defined as in the finite case.\nSimilarly, k[G] is a Hopf algebra if and only if G is a group, with\nS(x) = x-1 , x ∈ G.\nExercises 1.21.5 and 1.22.12 motivate the following definition:\nDefinition 1.22.13. In any coalgebra C, a nonzero element g ∈ C\nsuch that Δ(g) = g ⊗ g is called a grouplike element.\nExercise 1.22.14. Show that if g is a grouplike of a Hopf algebra H,\nthen g is invertible, with g-1 = S(g). Also, show that the product of\ntwo grouplike elements is grouplike. In particular, grouplike elements\nof any Hopf algebra H form a group, denoted G(H). Show that this\ngroup can also be defined as the group of isomorphism classes of 1\ndimensional H-comodules under tensor multiplication.\nProposition 1.22.15. If H is a finite dimensional bialgebra with an\nantipode S, then S is invertible, so H is a Hopf algebra.\nProof. Let Hn be the image of Sn . Since S is an antihomomorphism\nof algebras and coalgebras, Hn is a Hopf subalgebra of H. Let m be\nthe smallest n such that Hn = Hn+1 (it exists because H is finite\ndimensional). We need to show that m = 0. If not, we can assume\nthat m = 1 by replacing H with Hm-1.\nWe have a map S0 : H1 → H1 inverse to S. For a ∈ H, let the triple\ncoproduct of a be\nX\nai ⊗ ai ⊗ ai .\ni\nConsider the element\nb =\nS0(S(ai\n1))S(ai\n2)ai\n3 .\ni\nOn the one hand, collapsing the last two factors using the antipode\naxiom, we have b = S0(S(a)). On the other hand, writing b as\nb =\nS0(S(ai\n1))S(S0(S(ai\n2)))ai\ni\n\nand collapsing the first two factors using the antipode axiom, we get b =\na. Thus a = S0(S(a)) and thus a ∈ H1, so H = H1, a contradiction.\nExercise 1.22.16. Let μop and Δop be obtained from μ, Δ by permu\ntation of components.\n(i) Show that if (H, μ, i, Δ, ε, S) is a Hopf algebra, then Hop :=\n(H, μop, i, Δ, ε, S-1), Hcop := (H, μ, i, Δop, ε, S-1), Hcop := (H, μop, i, Δop, ε, S)\nop\nare Hopf algebras. Show that H is isomorphic to Hcop, and Hop to Hcop.\nop\n(ii) Suppose that a bialgebra H is a commutative (μ = μop) or co\ncommutative (Δ = Δop). Let S be an antipode on H. Show that\nS2 = 1.\n(iii) Assume that bialgebras H and Hcop have antipodes S and S0.\nShow that S0 = S-1, so H is a Hopf algebra.\nExercise 1.22.17. Show that if A, B are bialgebras, bialgebras with\nantipode, or Hopf algebras, then so is the tensor product A ⊗ B.\nExercise 1.22.18. A finite dimensional module or comodule over a\nHopf algebra is invertible if and only if it is 1-dimensional.\n1.23. Reconstruction theory in the infinite setting. In this sub\nsection we would like to generalize the reconstruction theory to the\nsituation when the category C is not assumed to be finite.\nLet C be any essentially small k-linear abelian category, and F : C →\nVec an exact, faithful functor. In this case one can define the space\nCoend(F ) as follows:\nCoend(F ) := (⊕X∈CF (X)∗ ⊗ F (X))/E\nwhere E is spanned by elements of the form y∗ ⊗ F (f)x - F (f)∗y∗ ⊗ x,\nx ∈ F (X), y∗ ∈ F (Y )∗, f ∈ Hom(X, Y ); in other words, Coend(F ) =\nlim End(F (X))∗. Thus we have End(F ) = lim End(F (X)) = Coend(F )∗,\n-→\n←-\nwhich yields a coalgebra structure on Coend(F ). So the algebra End(F )\n(which may be infinite dimensional) carries the inverse limit topology,\nin which a basis of neighborhoods of zero is formed by the kernels KX\nof the maps End(F ) → End(F (X)), X ∈C, and Coend(F ) = End(F )∨,\nthe space of continuous linear functionals on End(F ).\nThe following theorem is standard (see [Ta2]).\nTheorem 1.23.1. Let C be a k-linear abelian category with an ex\nact faithful functor F :\nVec. Then F defines an equivalence\nC →\nbetween C and the category of finite dimensional right comodules over\nC := Coend(F ) (or, equivalently, with the category of continuous finite\ndimensional left End(F )-modules).\n\nProof. (sketch) Consider the ind-object Q := ⊕X∈CF (X)∗ ⊗ X. For\nX, Y ∈C and f ∈ Hom(X, Y ), let\njf : F (Y )∗ ⊗ X → F (X)∗ ⊗ X ⊕ F (Y )∗ ⊗ Y ⊂ Q\nbe the morphism defined by the formula\njf = Id ⊗ f - F (f)∗ ⊗ Id.\nLet I be the quotient of Q by the image of the direct sum of all jf . In\nother words, I = lim (F (X)∗ ⊗ X).\n-→\nThe following statements are easy to verify:\n(i) I represents the functor F ( )∗, i.e. Hom(X, I) is naturally iso\n-\nmorphic to F (X)∗; in particular, I is injective.\n(ii) F (I) = C, and I is naturally a left C-comodule (the comod\nule structure is induced by the coevaluation morphism F (X)∗ ⊗ X →\nF (X)∗ ⊗ F (X) ⊗ F (X)∗ ⊗ X).\n(iii) Let us regard F as a functor C → C - comod. For M ∈ C -\ncomod, let θM : M ⊗I\nM ⊗C ⊗I be the morphism πM ⊗Id-Id⊗πI ,\n→\nand let KM be the kernel of θM . Then the functor G : C - comod →C\ngiven by the formula G(M) = KerθM , is a quasi-inverse to F .\nThis completes the proof.\n\nNow assume that the abelian category C is also monoidal. Then the\ncoalgebra Coend(F ) also carries a multiplication and unit, dual to the\ncomultiplication and counit of End(F ). More precisely, since End(F )\nmay now be infinite dimensional, the algebra End(F ⊗ F ) is in general\nisomorphic not to the usual tensor product End(F )⊗End(F ), but rather\nto its completion End(F )⊗b End(F ) with respect to the inverse limit\ntopology. Thus the comultiplication of End(F ) is a continuous linear\nmap Δ : End(F ) → End(F )⊗b End(F ). The dual Δ∗ of this map defines\na multiplication on Coend(F ).\nIf C has right duals, the bialgebra Coend(F ) acquires an antipode,\ndefined in the same way as in the finite dimensional case. This antipode\nis invertible if there are also left duals (i.e. if C is rigid). Thus Theorem\n1.23.1 implies the following \"infinite\" extensions of the reconstruction\ntheorems.\nTheorem 1.23.2. The assignments (C, F ) 7→ H = Coend(F ), H 7→\n(H - Comod, Forget) are mutually inverse bijections between\n1) k-linear abelian monoidal categories C with a fiber functor F , up\nto monoidal equivalence and isomorphism of monoidal functors, and\nbialgebras over k, up to isomorphism;\n\n2) k-linear abelian monoidal categories C with right duals with a fiber\nfunctor F , up to monoidal equivalence and isomorphism of monoidal\nfunctors, and bialgebras over k with an antipode, up to isomorphism;\n3) tensor categories C over k with a fiber functor F , up to monoidal\nequivalence and isomorphism of monoidal functors, and Hopf algebras\nover k, up to isomorphism.\nRemark 1.23.3. This theorem allows one to give a categorical proof\nof Proposition 1.22.4, deducing it from the fact that the right dual,\nwhen it exists, is unique up to a unique isomorphism.\nRemark 1.23.4. Corollary 1.22.15 is not true, in general, in the infi\nnite dimensional case: there exist bialgebras H with a non-invertible\nantipode S, see [Ta1]. Therefore, there exist ring categories with sim\nple object 1 and right duals that do not have left duals, i.e., are not\ntensor categories (namely, H - comod).\nIn the next few subsections, we will review some of the most im\nportant basic results about Hopf algebras. For a much more detailed\ntreatment, see the book [Mo].\n1.24. More examples of Hopf algebras. Let us give a few more\nexamples of Hopf algebras. As we have seen, to define a Hopf algebra, it\nsuffices to give an associative unital algebra H, and define a coproduct\non generators of H (this determines a Hopf algebra structure on H\nuniquely if it exists). This is what we'll do in the examples below.\nExample 1.24.1. (Enveloping algebras) Let g be a Lie algebra, and\nlet H = U(g) be the universal enveloping algebra of g. Define the\ncoproduct on H by setting Δ(x) = x ⊗ 1+1 ⊗ x for all x ∈ g. It is easy\nto show that this extends to the whole H, and that H equipped with\nthis Δ is a Hopf algebra. Moreover, it is easy to see that the tensor\ncategory Rep(H) is equivalent to the tensor category Rep(g).\nThis example motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 1.24.2. An element x of a bialgebra H is called primitive\nif Δ(x) = x⊗1+1⊗x. The space of primitive elements of H is denoted\nPrim(H).\nExercise 1.24.3. (i) Show that Prim(H) is a Lie algebra under the\ncommutator.\n(ii) Show that if x is a primitive element then ε(x) = 0, and in\npresence of an antipode S(x) = -x.\nExercise 1.24.4. (i) Let V be a vector space, and SV be the symmet\nric algebra V . Then SV is a Hopf algebra (namely, it is the universal\n\nenveloping algebra of the abelian Lie algebra V ). Show that if k has\ncharacteristic zero, then Prim(SV ) = V .\n(ii) What happens in characteristic p?\nHint. One can restrict to a situation when V is finite dimensional.\nIn this case, regarding elements f ∈ SV as polynomials on V ∗, one can\nshow that f is primitive if and only if it is additive, i.e., f(x + y) =\nf(x) + f(y).\n(iii) Let g be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero. Show\nthat Prim(U(g)) = g.\nHint. Identify U(g) with Sg as coalgebras by using the symmetriza\ntion map.\nExample 1.24.5. (Taft algebras) Let q be a primitive n-th root of\nunity. Let H be the algebra (of dimension n2) generated over k by g\nn\nn\nand x satisfying the following relations: g = 1, x = 0 and gxg-1 = qx.\nDefine the coproduct on H by Δ(g) = g ⊗ g, Δ(x) = x ⊗ g +1 ⊗ x. It is\neasy to show that this extends to a Hopf algebra structure on H. This\nHopf algebra H is called the Taft algebra. For n = 2, one obtains the\nSweedler Hopf algebra of dimension 4. Note that H is not commutative\nor cocommutative, and S2 = 1 on\nH (as S2(x) = qx).\nThis example motivates the following generalization of Definition\n1.24.2.\nDefinition 1.24.6. Let g, h be grouplike elements of a coalgebra H.\nA skew-primitive element of type (h, g) is an element x ∈ H such that\nΔ(x) = h ⊗ x + x ⊗ g.\nRemark 1.24.7. A multiple of h-g is always a skew-primitive element\nof type (h, g). Such a skew-primitive element is called trivial. Note that\nthe element x in Example 1.24.5 is nontrivial.\nExercise 1.24.8. Let x be a skew-primitive element of type h, g in a\nHopf algebra H.\n(i) Show that ε(x) = 0, S(x) = -h-1xg-1 .\n(ii) Show that if a, b ∈ H are grouplike elements, then axb is a skew-\nprimitive element of type (ahb, agb).\nExample 1.24.9. (Nichols Hopf algebras) Let H = C[Z/2Z]n∧(x1, ..., xn),\nwhere the generator g of Z/2Z acts on xi by gxig-1 = -xi. De\nfine the coproduct on H by making g grouplike, and setting Δ(xi) :=\nxi ⊗ g + 1 ⊗ xi (so xi are skew-primitive elements). Then H is a Hopf\nalgebra of dimension 2n+1 . For n = 1, H is the Sweedler Hopf algebra\nfrom the previous example.\n\nExercise 1.24.10. Show that the Hopf algebras of Examples 1.24.1,1.24.5,1.24.9\nare well defined.\nExercise 1.24.11. (Semidirect product Hopf algebras) Let H be a\nHopf algebra, and G a group of automorphisms of H. Let A be the\nsemidirect product k[G] n H. Show that A admits a unique structure\nof a Hopf algebra in which k[G] and H are Hopf subalgebras.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.769 Topics in Lie Theory: Tensor Categories\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

This motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 1.25.1. Let q ∈ k, q =6\n±1. The quantum group U (sl2) is\nq\ngenerated by elements E, F and an invertible element K with defining\nrelations\nKEK-1 = q 2E, KFK-1 = q-2F, [E, F] = K - K-1\n.\nq - q-1\nTheorem 1.25.2. There exists a unique Hopf algebra structure on\nUq (sl2), given by\n- Δ(K) = K ⊗ K\n(thus K is a grouplike element);\n- Δ(E) = E ⊗ K + 1 ⊗ E;\n- Δ(F) = F ⊗ 1 + K-1 ⊗ F\n(thus E, F are skew-primitive ele\nments).\nExercise 1.25.3. Prove Theorem 1.25.2.\nRemark 1.25.4. Heuristically, K = qh, and thus\nK - K-1\nlim\n= h.\nq\n→\nq - q-1\nSo in the limit q\n1, the relations of Uq (sl2) degenerate into the\n→\nrelations of U(sl2), and thus Uq (sl2) should be viewed as a Hopf algebra\ndeformation of the enveloping algebra U(sl2). In fact, one can make\nthis heuristic idea into a precise statement, see e.g. [K].\nIf q is a root of unity, one can also define a finite dimensional version\nof Uq (sl2). Namely, assume that the order of q is an odd number `. Let\nuq (sl2) be the quotient of Uq (sl2) by the additional relations\nE` = F` = K` - 1 = 0.\nThen it is easy to show that uq (sl2) is a Hopf algebra (with the co\nproduct inherited from Uq (sl2)). This Hopf algebra is called the small\nquantum group attached to sl2.\n1.26. The quantum group Uq (g). The example of the previous sub\nsection can be generalized to the case of any simple Lie algebra. Namely,\nlet g be a simple Lie algebra of rank r, and let A = (aij ) be its Cartan\nmatrix. Recall that there exist unique relatively prime positive integers\ndi, i = 1, . . . r such that diaij = dj aji. Let q ∈ k, q =6\n±1.\nDefinition 1.26.1.\n- The q-analog of n is\nn\nq - q-n\n[n]q =\n.\nq - q-1\n\nX\n- The q-analog of the factorial is\nn\n[n]q ! =\nY\n[l]q = (q - q-1) · · · (qn - q-n) .\n(q - q-1)n\nl=1\nDefinition 1.26.2. The quantum group Uq(g) is generated by elements\nEi, Fi and invertible elements Ki, with defining relations\nKiKj = Kj Ki, KiEj Ki\n-1 = q aij Ej , KiFj Ki\n-1 = q-aij Fj ,\nKdi - K-di\n[Ei, Fj ] = δij\ni\ni\n,\nand the q-Serre relations:\nqdi - q-di\n1-aij\n(1.26.1)\nX\n[l]q ![1\n(\n-\n-\na\n1)\nij\nl\n- l]q !

Fi\n1-aij -lFj Fl\ni = 0, i =6\nj.\nl=0\ni\ni\nMore generally, the same definition can be made for any symmetriz\nable Kac-Moody algebra g.\nTheorem 1.26.3. (see e.g. [CP]) There exists a unique Hopf algebra\nstructure on Uq (g), given by\n- Δ(Ki) = Ki ⊗ Ki;\n- Δ(Ei) = Ei ⊗ Ki + 1 ⊗ Ei;\nΔ(Fi) = Fi ⊗ 1 + Ki\n-1 ⊗ Fi.\n-\nRemark 1.26.4. Similarly to the case of sl2, in the limit q\n1, these\n→\nrelations degenerate into the relations for U(g), so Uq(g) should be\nviewed as a Hopf algebra deformation of the enveloping algebra U(g).\n1.27. Categorical meaning of skew-primitive elements. We have\nseen that many interesting Hopf algebras contain nontrivial skew-primitive\nelements. In fact, the notion of a skew-primitive element has a cate\ngorical meaning. Namely, we have the following proposition.\nProposition 1.27.1. Let g, h be grouplike elements of a coalgebra\nC, and Primh,g(C) be the space of skew-primitive elements of type\nh, g. Then the space Primh,g(H)/k(h - g) is naturally isomorphic to\nExt1(g, h), where g, h are regarded as 1-dimensional right C-comodules.\nProof. Let V be a 2-dimensional H-comodule, such that we have an\nexact sequence\nh\nV\ng\n0.\n→\n→\n→\n→\n\nThen V has a basis v0, v1 such that\nπ(v0) = v0 ⊗ h, π(v1) = v1 ⊗ x + v0 ⊗ g.\nThe condition that this is a comodule yields that x is a skew-primitive\nelement of type (h, g). So any extension defines a skew-primitive el\nement and vice versa. Also, we can change the basis by v0\nv0,\n→\nv1\nv1 + λv0, which modifies x by adding a trivial skew-primitive\n→\nelement. This implies the result.\n\nExample 1.27.2. The category C of finite dimensional comodules over\nuq (sl2) is an example of a finite tensor category in which there are\nobjects V such that V ∗∗ is not isomorphic to V . Namely, in this\ncategory, the functor V 7→ V ∗∗ is defined by the squared antipode\nS2 , which is conjugation by K: S2(x) = KxK-1 . Now, we have\nExt1(K, 1) = Y = hE, F Ki, a 2-dimensional space. The set of iso\nmorphism classes of nontrivial extensions of K by 1 is therefore the\nprojective line PY . The operator of conjugation by K acts on Y with\neigenvalues q2, q-2, hence nontrivially on PY . Thus for a generic ex\ntension V , the object V ∗∗ is not isomorphic to V .\nHowever, note that some power of the functor ∗∗ on C is isomorphic\n(in fact, monoidally) to the identity functor (namely, this power is the\norder of q). We will later show that this property holds in any finite\ntensor category.\nNote also that in the category C, V ∗∗ ∼= V if V is simple. This clearly\nhas to be the case in any tensor category where all simple objects\nare invertible. We will also show (see Proposition 1.41.1 below) that\nthis is the case in any semisimple tensor category. An example of a\ntensor category in which V ∗∗ is not always isomorphic to V even for\nsimple V is the category of finite dimensional representations of the\nthe Yangian H = Y (g) of a simple complex Lie algebra g, see [CP,\n12.1]. Namely, for any finite dimensional representation V of H and\nany complex number z one can define the shifted representation V (z)\n(such that V (0) = V ). Then V ∗∗∼V (2h∨), where h∨ is the dual\n=\nCoxeter number of g, see [CP, p.384]. If V is a non-trivial irreducible\nfinite dimensional representation then V (z) = V for z = 0. Thus,\n∼\n= V . Moreover, we see that the functor ∗∗ has infinite order even\nwhen restricted to simple objects of C.\nHowever, the representation category of the Yangian is infinite, and\nthe answer to the following question is unknown to us.\nV ∗∗ ∼6\nQuestion 1.27.3. Does there exist a finite tensor category, in which\nthere is a simple object V such that V ∗∗ is not isomorphic to V ? (The\nanswer is unknown to the authors).\n\nX\n\nTheorem 1.27.4. Assume that k has characteristic 0. Let C be a finite\nring category over k with simple object 1. Then Ext1(1, 1) = 0.\nProof. Assume the contrary, and suppose that V is a nontrivial exten\nsion of 1 by itself. Let P be the projective cover of 1. Then Hom(P, V )\nis a 2-dimensional space, with a filtration induced by the filtration on\nV , and both quotients naturally isomorphic to E := Hom(P, 1). Let\nv0, v1 be a basis of Hom(P, V ) compatible to the filtration, i.e. v0 spans\nthe 1-dimensional subspace defined by the filtration. Let A = End(P )\n(this is a finite dimensional algebra). Let ε : A\nk be the character\n→\ndefined by the (right) action of A on E. Then the matrix of a ∈ A in\nthe basis v0, v1 has the form\nε(a) χ1(a)\n(1.27.1)\n[a]1 =\nε(a)\nwhere χ1 ∈ A∗ is nonzero. Since a → [a]1 is a homomorphism, χ1 is a\nderivation: χ1(xy) = χ1(x)ε(y) + ε(x)χ1(y).\nNow consider the representation V ⊗ V . Using the exactness of\ntensor products, we see that the space Hom(P, V ⊗V ) is 4-dimensional,\nand has a 3-step filtration, with successive quotients E, E ⊕ E, E, and\nbasis v00; v01, v10; v11, consistent with this filtration. The matrix of\na ∈ End(P ) in this basis is\n⎞\n⎛\n(1.27.2)\n[a]2 =\n⎜\n⎜\n⎝\nε(a) χ1(a) χ1(a) χ2(a)\nε(a)\nχ1(a)\nε(a)\nχ1(a)\nε(a)\n⎟\n⎟\n⎠\nSince a\n[a]2 is a homomorphism, we find\n→\nχ2(ab) = ε(a)χ2(b) + χ2(a)ε(b) + 2χ1(a)χ1(b).\nWe can now proceed further (i.e. consider V ⊗V ⊗V etc.) and define for\nevery positive n, a linear function χn ∈ A∗ which satisfies the equation\nn\nχn(ab) =\nj\nχj (a)χn-j (b),\nj=0\nn\nwhere χ0\nε.\nP\nby φs(a) =\nχm(a)s\n=\nm≥0\npairwise distinct homomorphisms.\nThus for any s ∈ k, we can define φs : A\nk((t))\n→\nmtm/m!, and we find that φs is a family of\nfinite dimensional algebra. We are done.\nThis is a contradiction, as A is a\nCorollary 1.27.5. If a finite ring category C over a field of charac\nteristic zero has a unique simple object 1, then C is equivalent to the\ncategory Vec.\n\nCorollary 1.27.6. A finite dimensional bialgebra H over a field of\ncharacteristic zero cannot contain nonzero primitive elements.\nProof. Apply Theorem 1.27.4 to the category H - comod and use\nProposition 1.27.1.\n\nRemark 1.27.7. Here is a \"linear algebra\" proof of this corollary. Let\nx be a nonzero primitive element of H. Then we have a family of\ngrouplike elements estx ∈ H((t)), s ∈ k, i.e., an infinite collection of\ncharacters of H∗((t)), which is impossible, as H is finite dimensional.\nCorollary 1.27.8. If H is a finite dimensional commutative Hopf\nalgebra over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0, then\nH = Fun(G, k) for a unique finite group G.\nProof. Let G = Spec(H) (a finite group scheme), and x ∈ T1G =\n(m/m2)∗ where m is the kernel of the counit. Then x is a linear function\non m. Extend it to H by setting x(1) = 0. Then x s a derivation:\nx(fg) = x(f)g(1) + f(1)x(g).\nThis implies that x is a primitive element in H∗. So by Corollary\n1.27.6, x = 0. this implies that G is reduced at the point 1. By using\ntranslations, we see that G is reduced at all other points. So G is a\nfinite group, and we are done.\n\nRemark 1.27.9. Theorem 1.27.4 and all its corollaries fail in char\nacteristic p > 0. A counterexample is provided by the Hopf algebra\nk[x]/(xp), where x is a primitive element.\n1.28. Pointed tensor categories and pointed Hopf algebras.\nDefinition 1.28.1. A coalgebra C is pointed if its category of right co\nmodules is pointed, i.e., if any simple right C-comodule is 1-dimensional.\nRemark 1.28.2. A finite dimensional coalgebra C is pointed if and\nonly if the algebra C∗ is basic, i.e., the quotient C∗/Rad(C∗) of C∗ by\nits radical is commutative. In this case, simple C-comodules are points\nof Specm(H∗/Rad(H∗)), which justifies the term \"pointed\".\nDefinition 1.28.3. A tensor category C is pointed if every simple\nobject of C is invertible.\nThus, the category of right comodules over a Hopf algebra H is\npointed if and only if H is pointed.\nExample 1.28.4. The category Vecω is a pointed category. If G is\nG\na p-group and k has characteristic p, then Repk(G) is pointed. Any\ncocommutative Hopf algebra, the Taft and Nichols Hopf algebras, as\nwell as the quantum groups Uq (g) are pointed Hopf algebras.\n\nP\n1.29. The coradical filtration. Let C be a locally finite abelian cat\negory.\nAny object X ∈C has a canonical filtration\n(1.29.1)\n0 = X0 ⊂ X1 ⊂ X2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Xn = X\nsuch that Xi+1/Xi is the socle (i.e., the maximal semisimple subobject)\nof X/Xi (in other words, Xi+1/Xi is the sum of all simple subobjects\nof X/Xi). This filtration is called the socle filtration, or the coradical\nfiltration of X. It is easy to show by induction that the coradical\nfiltration is a filtration of X of the smallest possible length, such that\nthe successive quotients are semisimple. The length of the coradical\nfiltration of X is called the Loewy length of X, and denoted Lw(X).\nThen we have a filtration of the category C by Loewy length of objects:\nC0 ⊂C1 ⊂ ..., where Ci denotes the full subcategory of objects of C of\nLoewy length ≤ i + 1. Clearly, the Loewy length of any subquotient of\nan object X does not exceed the Loewy length of X, so the categories\nCi are closed under taking subquotients.\nDefinition 1.29.1. The filtration of C by Ci is called the coradical\nfiltration of C.\nIf C is endowed with an exact faithful functor F : C → Vec then we\ncan define the coalgebra C = Coend(F ) and its subcoalgebras Ci =\nCoend(F |Ci ), and we have Ci ⊂ Ci+1 and C = ∪iCi (alternatively, we\ncan say that Ci is spanned by matrix elements of C-comodules F (X),\nX ∈Ci). Thus we have defined an increasing filtration by subcoalgebras\nof any coalgebra C. This filtration is called the coradical filtration, and\nthe term C0 is called the coradical of C.\nThe \"linear algebra\" definition of the coradical filtration is as fol\nlows. One says that a coalgebra is simple if it does not have nontrivial\nsubcoalgebras, i.e. if it is finite dimensional, and its dual is a simple\n(i.e., matrix) algebra. Then C0 is the sum of all simple subcoalgebras\nof C. The coalgebras Cn+1 for n ≥ 1 are then defined inductively to\nbe the spaces of those x ∈ C for which\nΔ(x) ∈ Cn ⊗ C + C ⊗ C0.\nExercise 1.29.2. (i) Suppose that C is a finite dimensional coalgebra,\nand I is the Jacobson radical of C∗. Show that Cn\n⊥= In+1 . This\njustifies the term \"coradical filtration\".\n(ii) Show that the coproduct respects the coradical filtration, i.e.\nΔ(Cn) ⊂\ni\nn\n=0 Ci ⊗ Cn-i.\n(iii) Show that C0 is the direct sum of simple subcoalgebras of C.\nIn particular, grouplike elements of any coalgebra C are linearly inde\npendent.\n\nP\nHint. Simple subcoalgebras of C correspond to finite dimensional\nirrreducible representations of C∗.\nDenote by gr(C) the associated graded coalgebra of a coalgebra C\nwith respect to the coradical filtration. Then gr(C) is a Z+-graded\ncoalgebra. It is easy to see from Exercise 1.29.2(i) that the coradical\n\nfiltration of gr(C) is induced by its grading. A graded coalgebra C\nwith this property is said to be coradically graded, and a coalgebra C\n\nsuch that gr(C) = C is called a lifting of C.\nDefinition 1.29.3. A coalgebra C is said to be cosemisimple if C is a\ndirect sum of simple subcoalgebras.\nClearly, C is cosemisimple if and only if C - comod is a semisimple\ncategory.\nProposition 1.29.4. (i) A category C is semisimple if and only if\nC0 = C1.\n(ii) A coalgebra C is cosemisimple if and only if C0 = C1.\nProof. (ii) is a special case of (i), and (i) is clear, since the condition\nmeans that Ext1(X, Y ) = 0 for any simple X, Y , which implies (by\nthe long exact sequence of cohomology) that Ext1(X, Y ) = 0 for all\nX, Y ∈C.\n\nCorollary 1.29.5. (The Taft-Wilson theorem) If C is a pointed coal\ngebra, then C0 is spanned by (linearly independent) grouplike elements\ng, and C1/C0 = ⊕h,gPrimh,g(C)/k(h - g). In particular, any non\ncosemisimple pointed coalgebra contains nontrivial skew-primitive ele\nments.\nProof. The first statement is clear (the linear independence follows from\nExercise 1.29.2(iii). Also, it is clear that any skew-primitive element\nis contained in C1. Now, if x ∈ C1, then x is a matrix element of a\nC-comodule of Loewy length ≤ 2, so it is a sum of matrix elements 2\ndimensional comodules, i.e. of grouplike and skew-primitive elements.\nIt remains to show that the sum\nPrimh,g(C)/k(h - g) ⊂ C/C0\nh,g\nis direct. For this, it suffices to consider the case when C is finite\ndimensional. Passing to the dual algebra A = C∗, we see that the\nstatement is equivalent to the claim that I/I2 (where I is the radical\nof A) is isomorphic (in a natural way) to ⊕g,hExt1(g, h)∗.\nLet pg be a complete system of orthogonal idempotents in A/I2, such\nthat h(pg) = δhg. Define a pairing I/I2 × Ext1(g, h) → k which sends\na ⊗ α to the upper right entry of the 2-by-2 matrix by which a acts\nin the extension of g by h defined by α. It is easy to see that this\n\npairing descends to a pairing B : ph(I/I2)pg × Ext1(g, h) → k. If the\nextension α is nontrivial, the upper right entry cannot be zero, so B is\nright-nondegenerate. Similarly, if a belongs to the left kernel of B, then\na acts by zero in any A-module of Loewy length 2, so a = 0. Thus, B\nis left-nondegenerate. This implies the required isomorphism.\n\nProposition 1.29.6. If C, D are coalgebras, and f : C\nD is a\n→\ncoalgebra homomorphism such that f|C1 is injective, then f is injective.\nProof. One may assume that C and D are finite dimensional. Then\nthe statement can be translated into the following statement about\nfinite dimensional algebras: if A, B are finite dimensional algebras and\nf : A\nB is an algebra homomorphism which descends to a surjective\n→\nhomomorphism A\nB/Rad(B)2, then f is surjective.\n→\nTo prove this statement, let b ∈ B. Let I = Rad(B). We prove by\ninduction in n that there exists a ∈ A such that b - f(a) ∈ In . The\nbase of induction is clear, so we only need to do the step of induction.\nSo assume b ∈ In . We may assume that b = b1...bn, bi ∈ I, and let\nai ∈ A be such that f(ai) = bi modulo I2 . Let a = a1...an. Then\nb - f(a) ∈ In+1, as desired.\n\nCorollary 1.29.7. If H is a Hopf algebra over a field of characteristic\nzero, then the natural map ξ : U(Prim(H))\nH is injective.\n→\nProof. By Proposition 1.29.6, it suffices to check the injectivity of ξ in\ndegree 1 of the coradical filtration. Thus, it is enough to check that\nξ is injective on primitive elements of U(Prim(H)). But by Exercise\n1.24.4, all of them lie in Prim(H), as desired.\n\n1.30. Chevalley's theorem.\nTheorem 1.30.1. (Chevalley) Let k be a field of characteristic zero.\nThen the tensor product of two simple finite dimensional representa\ntions of any group or Lie algebra over k is semisimple.\nProof. Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over a field k (of any\ncharacteristic), and G ⊂ GL(V ) be a Zariski closed subgroup.\nLemma 1.30.2. If V is a completely reducible representation of G,\nthen G is reductive.\nProof. Let V be a nonzero rational representation of an affine algebraic\ngroup G. Let U be the unipotent radical of G. Let V U ⊂ V be the space\nof invariants. Since U is unipotent, V U = 0. So if\nV is irreducible, then\nV U = V , i.e., U acts trivially. Thus, U acts trivially on any completely\nreducible representation of G. So if V is completely reducible and\nG ⊂ GL(V ), then G is reductive.\n\nNow let G be any group, and V, W be two finite dimensional irre\nducible representations of G. Let GV , GW be the Zariski closures of\nthe images of G in GL(V ) and GL(W ), respectively. Then by Lemma\n1.30.2 GV , GW are reductive. Let GV W be the Zariski closure of the\nimage of G in GV × GW . Let U be the unipotent radical of GV W . Let\npV : GV W\nGV , pW : GV W\nGW be the projections. Since pV is\n→\n→\nsurjective, pV (U) is a normal unipotent subgroup of GV , so pV (U) = 1.\nSimilarly, pW (U) = 1. So U = 1, and GV W is reductive.\nLet G0\nV W be the closure of the image of G in GL(V ⊗ W ). Then\nG0\nV W is a quotient of GV W , so it is also reductive. Since chark = 0,\nthis implies that the representation V ⊗ W is completely reducible as\na representation of G0\nV W , hence of G.\nThis proves Chevalley's theorem for groups. The proof for Lie alge\nbras is similar.\n\n1.31. Chevalley property.\nDefinition 1.31.1. A tensor category C is said to have Chevalley prop\nerty if the category C0 of semisimple objects of C is a tensor subcategory.\nThus, Chevalley theorem says that the category of finite dimensional\nrepresentations of any group or Lie algebra over a field of characteristic\nzero has Chevalley property.\nProposition 1.31.2. A pointed tensor category has Chevalley prop\nerty.\nProof. Obvious.\n\nProposition 1.31.3. In a tensor category with Chevalley property,\n(1.31.1)\nLw(X ⊗ Y ) ≤ Lw(X) + Lw(Y ) - 1.\nThus Ci ⊗Cj ⊂Ci+j .\nProof. Let X(i), 0 ≤ i ≤ m, Y (j), 0 ≤ j ≤ n, be the successive\nquotients of the coradical filtrations of X, Y . Then Z := X ⊗ Y has\na filtration with successive quotients Z(r) = ⊕i+j=rX(i) ⊗ Y (j), 0 ≤\nr\nm + n. Because of the Chevalley property, these quotients are\n≤\nsemisimple. This implies the statement.\n\nRemark 1.31.4. It is clear that the converse to Proposition 1.31.3\nholds as well: equation (1.31.3) (for simple X and Y ) implies the\nChevalley property.\nCorollary 1.31.5. In a pointed Hopf algebra H, the coradical filtration\nis a Hopf algebra filtration, i.e. HiHj ⊂ Hi+j and S(Hi) = Hi, so gr(H)\nis a Hopf algebra.\n\nIn this situation, the Hopf algebra H is said to be a lifting of the\ncoradically graded Hopf algebra gr(H).\nExample 1.31.6. The Taft algebra and the Nichols algebras are corad\nically graded. The associated graded Hopf algebra of Uq (g) is the Hopf\nalgebra defined by the same relations as Uq (g), except that the commu\ntation relation between Ei and Fj is replaced with the condition that Ei\nand Fj commute (for all i, j). The same applies to the small quantum\ngroup uq (sl2).\nExercise 1.31.7. Let k be a field of characteristic p, and G a finite\ngroup. Show that the category Repk(G) has Chevalley property if and\nonly if G has a normal p-Sylow subgroup.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.769 Topics in Lie Theory: Tensor Categories\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "1.32. The Andruskiewitsch-Schneider conjecture. It is easy to\nsee that any Hopf algebra generated by grouplike and skew-primitive\nelements is automatically pointed.\nOn the other hand, there exist pointed Hopf algebras which are not\ngenerated by grouplike and skew-primitive elements. Perhaps the sim\nplest example of such a Hopf algebra is the algebra of regular functions\non the Heisenberg group (i.e. the group of upper triangular 3 by 3\nmatrices with ones on the diagonal). It is easy to see that the commu\ntative Hopf algebra H is the polynomial algebra in generators x, y, z\n(entries of the matrix), so that x, y are primitive, and\nΔ(z) = z ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ z + x ⊗ y.\nSince the only grouplike element in H is 1, and the only skew-primitive\nelements are x, y, H is not generated by grouplike and skew-primitive\nelements.\nHowever, one has the following conjecture, due to Andruskiewitsch\nand Schneider.\nConjecture 1.32.1. Any finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebra over\na field of characteristic zero is generated in degree 1 of its coradical\nfiltration, i.e., by grouplike and skew-primitive elements.\nIt is easy to see that it is enough to prove this conjecture for corad\nically graded Hopf algebras; this has been done in many special cases\n(see [AS]).\nThe reason we discuss this conjecture here is that it is essentially a\ncategorical statement. Let us make the following definition.\nDefinition 1.32.2. We say that a tensor category C is tensor-generated\nby a collection of objects Xα if every object of C is a subquotient of a\nfinite direct sum of tensor products of Xα.\nProposition 1.32.3. A pointed Hopf algebra H is generated by grou\nplike and skew-primitive elements if and only if the tensor category\nH - comod is tensor-generated by objects of length 2.\nProof. This follows from the fact that matrix elements of the tensor\nproduct of comodules V, W for H are products of matrix elements of\nV, W .\n\nThus, one may generalize Conjecture 1.32.1 to the following conjec\nture about tensor categories.\nConjecture 1.32.4. Any finite pointed tensor category over a field of\ncharacteristic zero is tensor generated by objects of length 2.\n\nAs we have seen, this property fails for infinite categories, e.g., for\nthe category of rational representations of the Heisenberg group. In\nfact, this is very easy to see categorically: the center of the Heisenberg\ngroup acts trivially on 2-dimensional representations, but it is not true\nfor a general rational representation.\n1.33. The Cartier-Kostant theorem.\nTheorem 1.33.1. Any cocommutative Hopf algebra H over an alge\nbraically closed field of characteristic zero is of the form k[G] n U(g),\nwhere g is a Lie algebra, and G is a group acting on g.\nProof. Let G be the group of grouplike elements of H. Since H is\ncocommutative, it is pointed, and Ext1(g, h) = 0 if g, h ∈ G, g 6= h.\nHence the category C = H-comod splits into a direct sum of blocks C =\n⊕g∈GCg, where Cg is the category of objects of C which have a filtration\nwith successive quotients isomorphic to g. So H = ⊕g∈GHg, where\nCg = Hg -comod, and Hg = gH1. Moreover, A = H1 is a Hopf algebra,\nand we have an action of G on A by Hopf algebra automorphisms.\nNow let g = Prim(A) = Prim(H). This is a Lie algebra, and the\ngroup G acts on it (by conjugation) by Lie algebra automorphisms. So\nwe need just to show that the natural homomorphism ψ : U(g)\nA is\n→\nactually an isomorphism.\nIt is clear that any morphism of coalgebras preserves the coradical\nfiltration, so we can pass to the associated graded morphism ψ0 : Sg →\nA0, where A0 = gr(A). It is enough to check that ψ0 is an isomorphism.\nThe morphism ψ0 is an isomorphism in degrees 0 and 1, and by\nCorollary 1.29.7, it is injective. So we only need to show surjectivity.\nWe prove the surjectivity in each degree n by induction. To simplify\nnotation, let us identify Sg with its image under ψ0. Suppose that the\nsurjectivity is known in all degrees below n. Let z be a homogeneous\nelement in A0 of degree n. Then it is easy to see from the counit axiom\nthat\n(1.33.1)\nΔ(z) - z ⊗ 1 - 1 ⊗ z = u\nwhere u ∈ Sg ⊗ Sg is a symmetric element (as Δ is cocommutative).\nEquation 1.33.1 implies that the element u satisfies the equation\n(1.33.2)\n(Δ ⊗ Id)(u) + u ⊗ 1 = (Id ⊗ Δ)(u) + 1 ⊗ u.\nLemma 1.33.2. Let V be a vector space over a field k of characteristic\nzero. Let u ∈ SV ⊗ SV be a symmetric element satisfying equation\n(1.33.2). Then u = Δ(w) - w ⊗ 1 - 1 ⊗ w for some w ∈ SV .\n\nX\n\nProof. Clearly, we may assume that V is finite dimensional. Regard u\nas a polynomial function on V ∗ × V ∗; our job is to show that\nu(x, y) = w(x + y) - w(x) - w(y)\nfor some polynomial w.\nIf we regard u as a polynomial, equation (1.33.2) takes the form of\nthe 2-cocycle condition\nu(x + y, t) + u(x, y) = u(x, y + t) + u(y, t).\nThus u defines a group law on U := V ∗ ⊕ k, given by\n(x, a) + (y, b) = (x + y, a + b + u(x, y)).\nClearly, we may assume that u is homogeneous, of some degree d = 1.\nSince u is symmetric, the group U is abelian. So in U we have\n((x, 0) + (x, 0)) + ((y, 0) + (y, 0)) = ((x, 0) + (y, 0)) + ((x, 0) + (y, 0))\nComputing the second component of both sides, we get\nu(x, x) + u(y, y) + 2d u(x, y) = 2u(x, y) + u(x + y, x + y).\nSo one can take w(x) = (2d - 2)-1u(x, x), as desired.\n\nNow, applying Lemma 1.33.2, we get that there exists w ∈ A0 such\nthat z - w is a primitive element, which implies that z - w ∈ A0, so\nz ∈ A0.\n\nRemark 1.33.3. The Cartier-Kostant theorem implies that any co\ncommutative Hopf algebra over an algebraically closed field of char\nacteristic zero in which the only grouplike element is 1 is of the form\nU(g), where g is a Lie algebra (a version of the Milnor-Moore theorem),\nin particular is generated by primitive elements. The latter statement\nis false in positive charactersitic. Namely, consider the commutative\nHopf algebra Q[x, z] where x, z are primitive, and set y = z + xp/p,\nwhere p is a prime. Then\np-1 1 p\n(1.33.3)\nΔ(y) = y ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ y +\np i\nx i ⊗ xp-i .\ni=1\nSince the numbers 1\np\np\ni are integers, this formula (together with Δ(x) =\nx ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ x, S(x) = -x, S(y) = -y) defines a Hopf algebra structure\non H = k[x, y] for any field k, in particular, one of characteristic p. But\nif k has characteristic p, then it is easy to see that H is not generated\nby primitive elements (namely, the element y is not in the subalgebra\ngenerated by them).\n\nThe Cartier-Kostant theorem implies that any affine pro-algebraic\ngroup scheme over a field of characteristic zero is in fact a pro-algebraic\ngroup. Namely, we have\nCorollary 1.33.4. Let H be a commutative Hopf algebra over a field\nk of characteristic zero. Then H has no nonzero nilpotent elements.\nProof. It is clear that H is a union of finitely generated Hopf subalge\nbras (generated by finite dimensional subcoalgebras of H), so we may\nassume that H is finitely generated. Let m be the kernel of the counit\nof H, and B = ∪inf\nn=1(H/mn)∗ (i.e., B is the continuous dual of the\nformal completion of H near the ideal m). It is easy to see that B is\na cocommutative Hopf algebra, and its only grouplike element is 1. So\nby the Cartier-Kostant theorem B = U(g), where g = (m/m2)∗. This\nimplies that G = Spec(H) is smooth at 1 ∈ G, i.e. it is an algebraic\ngroup, as desired.\n\nRemark 1.33.5. Note that Corollary 1.33.4 is a generalization of\nCorollary 1.27.6.\n1.34. Quasi-bialgebras. Let us now discuss reconstruction theory for\nquasi-fiber functors. This leads to the notion of quasi-bialgebras and\nquasi-Hopf algebras, which were introduced by Drinfeld in [Dr1] as\nlinear algebraic counterparts of abelian monoidal categories with quasi-\nfiber functors.\nDefinition 1.34.1. Let C be an abelian monoidal category over k,\nand (F, J) : C → Vec be a quasi-fiber functor. (F, J) is said to be\nnormalized if J1X = JX1 = IdF (X) for all X ∈C.\nDefinition 1.34.2. Two quasi-fiber functors (F, J1) and (F, J2) are\nsaid to be twist equivalent (by the twist J1\n-1J2).\nSince for a quasi-fiber functor (unlike a fiber functor), the isomor\nphism J is not required to satisfy any equations, it typically does not\ncarry any valuable structural information, and thus it is more reason\nable to classify quasi-fiber functors not up to isomorphism, but rather\nup to twist equivalence combined with isomorphism.\nRemark 1.34.3. It is easy to show that any quasi-fiber functor is\nequivalent to a normalized one.\nNow let C be a finite abelian monoidal category over k, and let\n(F, J) be a normalized quasi-fiber functor. Let H = End F be the\ncorresponding finite dimensional algebra. Then H has a coproduct Δ\nand a counit ε defined exactly as in the case of a fiber functor, which\nare algebra homomorphisms. The only difference is that, in general,\n\nΔ is not coassociative, since J does not satisfy the monoidal structure\naxiom. Rather, there is an invertible element Φ ∈ H⊗3, defined by the\ncommutative diagram\n(1.34.1)\nΦ F (X),F (Y ),F (Z)\n(F (X) ⊗ F (Y )) ⊗ F (Z) ---------→ F (X) ⊗ (F (Y ) ⊗ F (Z))\n⏐⏐y\n⏐⏐y\nJX,Y ⊗IdF (Z)\nIdF (X)⊗JY,Z\nF (X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ F (Z)\nJX⊗Y,Z\n⏐⏐y\n⏐⏐y\nF (X) ⊗ F (Y ⊗ Z)\nJX,Y ⊗Z\nF (aX,Y,Z )\nF ((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z)\n-----→\nF (X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z))\nfor all X, Y, Z ∈C, and we have the following proposition.\nProposition 1.34.4. The following identities hold:\n(1.34.2)\n(Id ⊗ Δ)(Δ(h)) = Φ(Δ ⊗ Id)(Δ(h))Φ-1 ,\nh ∈ H,\n(1.34.3)\n(Id ⊗ Id ⊗ Δ)(Φ)(Δ ⊗ Id ⊗ Id)(Φ) = (1 ⊗ Φ)(Id ⊗ Δ ⊗ Id)(Φ)(Φ ⊗ 1),\n(1.34.4)\n(ε ⊗ Id)(Δ(h)) = h = (Id ⊗ ε)(Δ(h)),\n(1.34.5)\n(Id ⊗ ε ⊗ Id)(Φ) = 1 ⊗ 1.\nProof. The first identity follows from the definition of Φ, the second\none from the pentagon axiom for C, the third one from the condition\nthat (F, J) is normalized, and the fourth one from the triangle axiom\nand the condition that (F, J) is normalized.\n\nDefinition 1.34.5. An associative unital k-algebra H equipped with\nunital algebra homomorphisms Δ : H\nH ⊗ H (the coproduct) and\n→\nε : H → k (the counit) and an invertible element Φ ∈ H⊗3 satisfying\nthe identities of Proposition 1.34.4 is called a quasi-bialgebra. The\nelement Φ is called the associator of H.\nThus, the notion of a quasi-bialgebra is a generalization of the notion\nof a bialgebra; namely, a bialgebra is a quasi-bialgebra with Φ = 1.11\nFor a quasi-bialgebra H, the tensor product of (left) H-modules V\nand W is an H-module via Δ, i.e., in the same way as for bialgebras.\nAlso, it follows from (1.34.2) that for any H-modules U, V, W the map\nping\n(1.34.6)\n= U ⊗(V ⊗W ) : u⊗v⊗w 7→ Φ(u⊗v⊗w)\naU,V,W : (U ⊗V )⊗W ∼\n11However, note that Δ can be coassociative even if Φ = 1.\n\nX\nis an H-module isomorphism. The axiom (1.34.4) implies that the\nnatural maps lV = Id : 1 ⊗ V\n∼V and rV = Id : V ⊗ 1\n∼V are also\n-→\n-→\nH-module isomorphisms. Finally, equations (1.34.3) and (1.34.5) say,\nrespectively, that the pentagon axiom (1.1.2) and the triangle axiom\n(1.2.1) are satisfied for Rep(H). In other words, Rep(H) is a monoidal\ncategory.\nDefinition 1.34.6. A twist for a quasi-bialgebra H is an invertible\nelement J ∈ H ⊗ H such that (ε ⊗ Id)(J) = (Id ⊗ ε)(J) = 1. Given a\ntwist, we can define a new quasi-bialgebra HJ which is H as an algebra,\nwith the same counit, the coproduct given by\nΔJ (x) = J-1Δ(x)J,\nand the associator given by\nΦJ = (Id ⊗ J)-1(Id ⊗ Δ)(J)-1Φ(Δ ⊗ Id)(J)(J ⊗ Id)\nThe algebra HJ is called twist equivalent to H, by the twist J.\nIt is easy to see that twist equivalent quasi-fiber functors produce\ntwist-equivalent quasi-bialgebras, and vice versa. Also, we have the\nfollowing proposition.\nProposition 1.34.7. If a finite k-linear abelian monoidal category C\nadmits a quasi-fiber functor, then this functor is unique up to twisting.\nProof. Let Xi, i = 1, ..., n be the simple objects of C. The functor\nF is exact, so it is determined up to isomorphism by the numbers\ndi = dim F (Xi). So our job is to show that these numbers are uniquely\ndetermined by C.\nLet Ni = (Nij\nk ) be the matrix of left multiplication by Xi in the\nGrothendieck ring of C in the basis {Xj }, i.e.\nXiXj =\nNij\nk Xk\n(so, k labels the rows and j labels the columns of Ni).\nWe claim that di is the spectral radius of Ni. Indeed, on the one\nhand, we have\nX\nNij\nmdm = didj ,\nso di is an eigenvalue of Ni\nT , hence of Ni. On the other hand, if ej is the\nstandard basis of Zn then for any r ≥ 0 the sum of the coordinates of\nthe vector Ni\nrej is the length of the object X⊗r ⊗Xj , so it is dominated\ni\nby dr\ni dj. This implies that the spectral radius of Ni is at most di. This\nmeans that the spectral radius is exactly di, as desired.\n\nTherefore, we have the following reconstruction theorem.\n\nX\nX\nP\nX\nX\nTheorem 1.34.8. The assignments (C, F ) 7→ H = End(F ), H 7→\n(Rep(H), Forget) are mutually inverse bijections between\n1) finite k-linear abelian monoidal categories C admitting a quasi-\nfiber functor, up to monoidal equivalence of categories.\n2) finite dimensional quasi-bialgebras H over k up to twist equiva\nlence and isomorphism.\nProof. Straightforward from the above.\n\nExercise 1.34.9. Suppose that in the situation of Exercise 1.21.6, the\nfunctor F is equipped with a quasi-monoidal structure J, i.e. an iso\nmorphism J : F ( ) ⊗ F ( )\nF (- ⊗-), such that J1X = JX1 = IdF (X).\n-\n- →\nShow that this endows H with the structure of a quasi-bialgebra, such\nthat (F, J) defines a monoidal equivalence C → Rep(H).\nRemark 1.34.10. Proposition 1.34.7 is false for infinite categories.\nFor example, it is known that if C = Rep(SL2(C)), and V ∈C is a 2\ndimensional repesentation, then there exists a for any positive integer\nn ≥ 2 there exists a fiber functor on C with dim F (V ) = n (see [Bi]).\n1.35. Quasi-bialgebras with an antipode and quasi-Hopf alge\nbras. Now consider the situation of the previous subsection, and as\nsume that the category C has right duals. In this case, by Proposition\n1.13.5, the right dualization functor is exact; it is also faithful by Propo\nsition 1.10.9. Therefore, the functor F (V ∗)∗ is another quasi-fiber func\ntor on C. So by Proposition 1.34.7, this functor is isomorphic to F . Let\nus fix such an isomorphism ξ = (ξV ), ξV : F (V )\nF (V ∗)∗. Then we\n→\nhave natural linear maps k → F (V ) ⊗ F (V ∗), F (V ∗) ⊗ F (V ) → k con\nstructed as in Exercise 1.10.6, which can be regarded as linear maps\nαˆ : F (V )\nF (V ∗)∗ and βˆ : F (V ∗)∗\nF (V ). Thus, the quasi\n→\n→\nbialgebra H = End(F ) has the following additional structures.\n1. The elements α, β ∈ H such that for any V ∈C, αV = ξ-1\nαˆV ,\nV\nβV = βˆV * ξV . Note that α and β are not necessarily invertible.\n*\n2. The antipode S : H\nH, which is a unital algebra antihomo\n→ P\nmorphism such that if Δ(a) =\ni ai\n1 ⊗ ai\n2 , a ∈ H, then\n(1.35.1)\nS(a 1\ni )αa2\ni = ε(a)α,\na 1\ni βS(a 2\ni ) = ε(a)β.\ni\ni\nNamely, for a ∈ H S(a) acts on F (V ) by ξ-1 * a∗\nξ.\nP\nF (V ∗) *\nLet us write the associator as Φ =\ni Φ1\ni ⊗ Φi\n2 ⊗ Φ3\ni and its inverse\nas\nΦ 1\ni ⊗ Φ 2\ni ⊗ Φ 3\ni .\nProposition 1.35.1. One has\n(1.35.2)\nΦ1\ni βS(Φi\n2)αΦ3\ni = 1,\nS(Φ 1\ni )αΦ 2\ni βS(Φ 3\ni ) = 1.\n\nP\nX\nProof. This follows directly from the duality axioms.\n\nDefinition 1.35.2. An antipode on a quasi-bialgebra H is a triple\n(S, α, β), where S : H\nH is a unital antihomomorphism and α, β ∈\n→\nH, satisfying identities (1.35.1) and (1.35.2).\nA quasi-Hopf algebra is a quasi-bialgebra (H, Δ, ε, Φ) for which there\nexists an antipode (S, α, β) such that S is bijective.\nThus, the notion of a quasi-Hopf algebra is a generalization of the\nnotion of a Hopf algebra; namely, a Hopf algebra is a quasi-Hopf algebra\nwith Φ = 1, α = β = 1.\nWe see that if in the above setting C has right duals, then H =\nEnd(F ) is a finite dimensional bialgebra admitting antipode, and if C\nis rigid (i.e., a tensor category), then H is a quasi-Hopf algebra.\nConversely, if H is a quasi-bialgebra with an antipode, then the\ncategory C = Rep(H) admits right duals. Indeed, the right dual module\nof an H-module V is defined as in the Hopf algebra case: it is the dual\nvector space V ∗ with the action of H given by\nh hφ, v i = h φ, S(h)v i,\nv ∈ V, φ ∈ V ∗, h ∈ H.\nLet\nvi ⊗ fi be the image of IdV under the canonical isomorphism\nEnd(V )\n∼\nThen the evaluation and coevaluation maps are\n-→ V ⊗ V ∗.\ndefined using the elements α and β:\nevV (f ⊗ v) = f(αv), coevV (1) =\nβvi ⊗ fi.\nAxiom (1.35.1) is then equivalent to evV and coevV being H-module\nmaps. Equations (1.35.2) are equivalent, respectively, to axioms (1.10.1)\nand (1.10.2) of a right dual.\nIf S is invertible, then the right dualization functor is an equivalence\nof categories, so the representation category Rep(H) of a quasi-Hopf\nalgebra H is rigid, i.e., a tensor category.\nExercise 1.35.3. Let H := (H, Δ, ε, Φ, S, α, β) be a quasi-bialgebra\nwith an antipode, and u ∈ H be an invertible element.\n(i) Show that if one sets\n(1.35.3)\nS(h) = uS(h)u-1 ,\nα = uα,\nand\nβ = βu-1\nthen the triple (S, α, β) is an antipode.\n(ii) Conversely, show that any S, α, and β satisfying conditions\n(1.35.1) and (1.35.2) are given by formulas (1.35.3) for a uniquely de\nfined u.\nHint. If H is finite dimensional, (ii) can be formally deduced from\nthe uniqueness of the right dual in a tensor category up to a unique\n\nX\nX\nisomorphism. Use this approach to obtain the unique possible formula\nfor u, and check that it does the job for any H.\nRemark 1.35.4. The non-uniqueness of S, α, and β observed in Ex\nercise 1.35.3 reflects the freedom in choosing the isomorphism ξ.\nExample 1.35.5. (cf. Example 1.10.14) Let G be a finite group and\nlet ω ∈ Z3(G, k×) be a normalized 3-cocycle, see (1.3.1). Consider\nthe algebra H = Fun(G, k) of k-valued functions on G with the usual\ncoproduct and counit. Set\nΦ =\nω(f, g, h)pf ⊗ pg ⊗ ph,\nα =\nω(g, g-1 , g)pg,\nβ = 1,\nwhere pg is the primitive idempotent of H corresponding to g ∈ G.\nIt is straightforward to check that these data define a commutative\nquasi-Hopf algebra, which we denote Fun(G, k)ω. The tensor category\nRep(Fun(G, k)ω) is obviously equivalent to Vecω\nG.\nIt is easy to show that a twist of a quasi-bialgebra H with an antipode\nis again a quasi-bialgebra with an antipode (this reflects the fact that\nin the finite dimensional case, the existence of an antipode for H is the\nproperty of the category of finite dimensional representations of H).\nIndeed, if the twist J and its inverse have the form\nX\nX\nJ =\nai ⊗ bi, J-1 =\na0\ni ⊗ b0\ni\ni\ni\nP\nthen HJ has an antipode (SJ , αJ , βJ ) with SJ = S and αJ\nP\n=\ni S(ai)αbi,\nβJ =\ni a0\niβS(b0\ni). Thus, we have the following reconstruction theorem.\nTheorem 1.35.6. The assignments (C, F ) 7→ H = End(F ), H 7→\n(Rep(H), Forget) are mutually inverse bijections between\n(i) finite abelian k-linear monoidal categories C with right duals ad\nmitting a quasi-fiber functor, up to monoidal equivalence of categories,\nand finite dimensional quasi-bialgebras H over k with an antipode, up\nto twist equivalence and isomorphism;\n(ii) finite tensor categories C admitting a quasi-fiber functor, up to\nmonoidal equivalence of categories, and finite dimensional quasi-Hopf\nalgebras H over k, up to twist equivalence and isomorphism.\nRemark 1.35.7. One can define the dual notions of a coquasi-bialgebra\nand coquasi-Hopf algebra, and prove the corresponding reconstruction\ntheorems for tensor categories which are not necessarily finite. This is\nstraightforward, but fairly tedious, and we will not do it here.\n\nP\nP\nP\n1.36. Twists for bialgebras and Hopf algebras. Let H be a bial\ngebra. We can regard it as a quasi-bialgebra with Φ = 1. Let J be a\ntwist for H.\nDefinition 1.36.1. J is called a bialgebra twist if HJ is a bialgebra,\ni.e. ΦJ = 1.\nThus, a bialgebra twist for H is an invertible element J ∈ H ⊗H such\nthat (ε ⊗ Id)(J) = (Id ⊗ ε)(J) = 1, and J satisfies the twist equation\n(1.36.1)\n(Id ⊗ Δ)(J)(Id ⊗ J) = (Δ ⊗ Id)(J)(J ⊗ Id).\nExercise 1.36.2. Show that if a bialgebra H has an antipode S, and J\nis a bialgebra twist for H, then the bialgebra HJ also has an antipode.\nNamely, let J =\nai ⊗ bi, J-1 =\na0\ni ⊗ b0\ni, and set QJ =\nS(ai)bi.\nP\ni\nThen QJ is invertible with Q-\nJ\n1 =\ni a0\niS(b0\ni), and the antipode of HJ\nis defined by SJ (x) = QJ\n-1S(x)QJ . In particular, a bialgebra twist of\na Hopf algebra is again a Hopf algebra.\nRemark 1.36.3. Twisting does not change the category of H-modules\nas a monoidal category, and the existence of an antipode (for finite\ndimensional H) is a categorical property (existence of right duals).\nThis yields the above formulas, and then one easily checks that they\nwork for any H.\nAny twist on a bialgebra H defines a fiber functor (Id, J) on the\ncategory Rep(H). However, two different twists J1, J2 may define iso\nmorphic fiber functors. It is easy to see that this happens if there is an\ninvertible element v ∈ H such that\nJ2 = Δ(v)J1(v-1 ⊗ v-1).\nIn this case the twists J1 and J2 are called gauge equivalent by the\ngauge transformation v, and the bialgebras HJ1 , HJ2 are isomorphic\n(by conjugation by v). So, we have the following result.\nProposition 1.36.4. Let H be a finite dimensional bialgebra. Then\nJ 7→ (Id, J) is a bijection between:\n1) gauge equivalence classes of bialgebra twists for H, and\n2) fiber functors on C = Rep(H), up to isomorphism.\nProof. By Proposition 1.34.7, any fiber functor on C is isomorphic to\nthe forgetful functor F as an additive functor. So any fiber functor, up\nto an isomorphism, has the form (F, J), where J is a bialgebra twist.\nNow it remains to determine when (F, J1) and (F, J2) are isomorphic.\nLet v : (F, J1) → (F, J2) be an isomorphism. Then v ∈ H is an\ninvertible element, and it defines a gauge transformation mapping J1\nto J2.\n\nProposition 1.36.5. Let G be a group. Then fiber functors on VecG\nup to an isomorphism bijectively correspond to H2(G, k×).\nProof. A monoidal structure on the forgetful functor F is given by a\nfunction J(g, h) : δg ⊗ δh → δg ⊗ δh, J(g, h) ∈ k×. It is easy to see that\nthe monoidal structure condition is the condition that J is a 2-cocycle,\nand two 2-cocycles define isomorphic monoidal structures if and only\nif they differ by a coboundary. Thus, equivalence classes of monoidal\nstructures on F are parametrized by H2(G, k×), as desired.\n\nRemark 1.36.6. Proposition 1.36.5 shows that there may exist non-\nisomorphic fiber functors on a given finite tensor category C defining\nisomorphic Hopf algebras. Indeed, all fiber functors on VecG yield the\nsame Hopf algebra Fun(G, k). These fiber functors are, however, all\nequivalent to each other by monoidal autoequivalences of C.\nRemark 1.36.7. Since Vecω does not admit fiber functors for cohomo-\nG\nlogically nontrivial ω, Proposition 1.36.5 in fact classifies fiber functors\non all categories Vecω\nG.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.769 Topics in Lie Theory: Tensor Categories\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

A pivotal\nstructure on C is an isomorphism of monoidal functors a : Id\n∼?∗∗.\n-→\nThat is, a pivotal structure is a collection of morphisms aX : X\n∼-→\nX∗∗ natural in X and satisfying aX⊗Y = aX ⊗ aY for all objects X, Y\nin C.\nDefinition 1.38.2. A rigid monoidal category C equipped with a piv\notal structure is said to be pivotal.\nExercise 1.38.3.\n(1) If a is a pivotal structure then aV ∗ = (aV )∗-1 .\nHence, aV ∗∗ = a∗∗\nV .\n\n(2) Let C = Rep(H), where H is a finite dimensional Hopf alge\nbra. Show that pivotal structures on C bijectively correspond\nto group-like elements of H such that gxg-1 = S2(x) for all\nx ∈ H.\nLet a be a pivotal structure on a rigid monoidal category C.\nDefinition 1.38.4. The dimension of an object X with respect to a\nis dima(X) := Tr(aX ) ∈ End(1).\nThus, in a tensor category over k, dimensions are elements of k. Also,\nit follows from Exercise 1.38.3 that dima(V ) = dima(V ∗∗).\nProposition 1.38.5. If C is a tensor category, then the function X 7→\ndima(X) is a character of the Grothendieck ring Gr(C).\nProof. Proposition 1.37.3 implies that dima is additive on exact se\nquences, which means that it gives rise to a well-defined linear map\nfrom Gr(C) to k. The fact that this map is a character follows from the\nobvious fact that dima(1) = 1 and Proposition 1.37.1(3).\n\nCorollary 1.38.6. Dimensions of objects in a pivotal finite tensor cat\negory are algebraic integers in k. 12\nProof. This follows from the fact that a character of any ring that is\nfinitely generated as a Z-module takes values in algebraic integers.\n1.39. Spherical categories.\nDefinition 1.39.1. A pivotal structure a on a tensor category C is\nspherical if dima(V ) = dima(V ∗) for any object V in C. A tensor\ncategory is spherical if it is equipped with a spherical structure.\nSince dima is additive on exact sequences, it suffices to require the\nproperty dima(V ) = dima(V ∗) only for simple objects V .\nTheorem 1.39.2. Let C be a spherical category and V be an object of\nThen for any x ∈ Hom(V, V ) one has TrL (aV x) = TrR (xa-1).\nC.\nV\nV\nV\nProof. We first note that TrR (a-1) = dima(X∗) for any object X by\nX\nX\nProposition 1.37.1(1) and Exercise 1.38.3(1). Now let us prove the\nproposition in the special case when V is semisimple. Thus V = ⊕i Yi ⊗\nVi, where Vi are vector spaces and Yi are simple objects. Then x =\n12If k has positive characteristic, by an algebraic integer in k we mean an element\nof a finite subfield of k.\n\nX\nX\n\n⊕i xi ⊗IdVi with xi ∈ Endk(Yi) and a = ⊕ IdYi ⊗aVi (by the functoriality\nof a). Hence\nTrL\nV (ax) =\nTr(xi) dim(Vi),\nTrR\nV (xa-1) =\nTr(xi) dim(Vi\n∗).\nThis implies the result for a semisimple V .\nConsider now the general case. Then V has the coradical filtration\n(1.39.1)\n0 = V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Vn = V\n(such that Vi+1/Vi is a maximal semisimple subobject in V/Vi). This\nfiltration is preserved by x and by a (i.e., a : Vi\nVi\n∗∗). Since traces\n→\nare additive on exact sequences by Proposition 1.37.3, this implies that\nthe general case of the required statement follows from the semisimple\ncase.\n\nExercise 1.39.3. (i) Let Aut⊗(IdC) be the group of isomorphism classes\nof monoidal automorphisms of a monoidal category C. Show that the\nset of isomorphism classes of pivotal structures on C is a torsor over\nAut⊗(IdC), and the set of isomorphism classes of spherical structures\non C is a torsor over the subgroup Aut⊗(IdC)2 in Aut⊗(IdC ) of elements\nwhich act by ±1 on simple objects.\n1.40. Semisimple multitensor categories. In this section we will\nmore closely consider semisimple multitensor categories which have\nsome important additional properties compared to the general case.\n1.41. Isomorphism between V ∗∗ and V .\nProposition 1.41.1. Let C be a semisimple multitensor category and\nlet V be an object in C.\n= V ∗.\n= V ∗∗.\nThen ∗V ∼\nHence, V ∼\nProof. We may assume that V is simple.\nWe claim that the unique simple object X such that Hom(1, V ⊗X) =6\n0 is V ∗. Indeed, Hom(1, V ⊗ X) ∼Hom(∗X, V ) which is non-zero if\n=\nand only if ∗X ∼\n= V ∗.\n= V , i.e., X ∼\nSimilarly, the unique simple object\nX such that Hom(V ⊗ X, 1) =6\n0 is ∗V . But since C is semisimple,\ndimk Hom(1, V ⊗ X) = dimk Hom(V ⊗ X, 1), which implies the result.\nRemark 1.41.2. As noted in Remark 1.27.2, the result of Proposi\ntion 1.41.1 is false for non-semisimple categories.\nRemark 1.41.3. Proposition 1.41.1 gives rise to the following ques\ntion.\n\nP\nP\nP\n\nQuestion 1.41.4. Does any semisimple tensor category admit a piv\notal structure? A spherical structure?\nThis is the case for all known examples. The general answer is un\nknown to us at the moment of writing (even for ground fields of char\nacteristic zero).\nProposition 1.41.5. If C is a semisimple tensor category and a : V\n∼-→\nV ∗∗ for a simple object V then Tr(a) = 0.\nProof. Tr(a) is the composition morphism of the diagram 1\nV ⊗\n→\nV ∗\n1 where both morphisms are non-zero. If the composition mor\n→\nphism is zero then there is a non-zero morphism (V ⊗V ∗)/1 → 1 which\nmeans that the [V ⊗ V ∗ : 1] ≥ 2. Since C is semisimple, this implies\nthat dimk Hom(1, V ⊗ V ∗) is at least 2. Hence, dimk Hom(V, V ) ≥ 2\nwhich contradicts the simplicity of V .\n\nRemark 1.41.6. The above result is false for non-semisimple cate\ngories. For example, let C = Repk(GLp(Fp)), the representation cat\negory of the group GLp(Fp) over a field k of characteristic p. Let\nV be the p dimensional vector representation of GLp(Fp) (which is\nclearly irreducible). Let a : V\nV ∗∗ be the identity map. Then\n→\nTr(a) = dimk(V ) = p = 0 in k.\n1.42. Grothendieck rings of semisimple tensor categories.\nDefinition 1.42.1. (i) A Z+-basis of an algebra free as a module over\nZ is a basis B = {bi} such that bibj =\nk cij\nk bk, cij\nk ∈ Z+.\n(ii) A Z+-ring is an algebra over Z with unit equipped with a fixed\nZ+-basis.\nDefinition 1.42.2.\n(1) A Z+-ring A with basis {bi}i∈I is called a\nbased ring if the following conditions hold\nP\n[a] There exists a subset I0 ⊂ I such that 1 =\ni∈I0 bi.\n[b] Let τ : A\nZ be the group homomorphism defined by\n→\n\n(1.42.1)\nτ(bi) =\nif i ∈ I0\n0 if i 6∈ I0\nThere exists an involution i 7→ i∗ of I such that induced map\na =\ni∈I aibi 7→ a∗ =\ni∈I aibi∗ , ai ∈ Z is an anti-involution\nof ring A and such that\n1 if i = j∗\n(1.42.2)\nτ(bibj ) =\nif i = j∗.\n(2) A unital Z+-ring is a Z+-ring A such that 1 belongs to the basis.\n\nM\nM M\nM M\n(3) A multifusion ring is a based ring of finite rank. A fusion ring\nis a unital based ring of finite rank.\nRemark 1.42.3.\n(1) It follows easily from definition that i, j ∈\nI0, i =6\nj implies that b2\ni = bi, bibj = 0, i∗ = i.\n(2) It is easy to see that for a given Z+-ring A, being a (unital)\nbased ring is a property, not an additional structure.\n(3) Note that any Z+-ring is assumed to have a unit, and is not\nnecessarily a unital Z+-ring.\nProposition 1.42.4. If C is a semisimple multitensor category then\nGr(C) is a based ring. If C is semisimple tensor category then Gr(C) is\na unital based ring. If C is a (multi)fusion category, then Gr(C) is a\n(multi)fusion ring.\nProof. The Z+-basis in Gr(C) consists of isomorphism classes of simple\nobjects of C. The set I0 consists of the classes of simple subobjects of\n1. The involution ∗ is the duality map (by Proposition 1.41.1 it does\nnot matter whether to use left or right duality). This implies the first\ntwo statements. The last statement is clear.\n\nExample 1.42.5. Let C be the category of finite dimensional repre\nsentations of the Lie algebra sl2(C). Then the simple objects of this\ncategory are irreducible representations Vm of dimension m + 1 for\nm = 0, 1, 2, . . . ; V0 = 1. The Grothendieck ring of C is determined by\nthe well-known Clebsch-Gordon rule\ni+j\n(1.42.3)\nVi ⊗ Vj =\nVl.\nl=|i-j|,i+j-l∈2Z\nThe duality map on this ring is the identity. The same is true if C =\nRep(Uq (sl2)) when q is not a root of unity, see [K].\nLet C be a semisimple multitensor category with simple objects\n{Xi}i∈I . Let I0 be the subset of I such that 1 = ⊕i∈I0 Xi. Let\nHij\nl := Hom(Xl, Xi ⊗ Xj ) (if Xp ∈Cij with p ∈ I and i, j ∈ I0, we\nwill identify spaces Hp and Hp with k using the left and right unit\npi\nip\nmorphisms).\nL\nWe have Xi ⊗ Xj =\nl Hij\nl ⊗ Xl. Hence,\n(Xi1\n=\nHj\n⊗ Hi4\n⊗ Xi2 ) ⊗ Xi3 ∼\ni1i2\nji3 ⊗ Xi4\ni4\nj\nXi1 ⊗ (Xi2\n)\n=\nHi\ni\nl ⊗ Hl\n.\n⊗ Xi3\n∼\ni2i3 ⊗ Xi4\ni4\nl\n\nM\nM\nThus the associativity constraint reduces to a collection of linear iso\nmorphisms\n(1.42.4)\nΦi4\n:\nHj\n⊗ Hi4 =\nHi4\n.\ni1i2i3\ni1i2\nji3 ∼\ni1l ⊗ Hi\nl\n2i3\nj\nl\nThe matrix blocks of these isomorphisms,\n(1.42.5)\n(Φi4\n)jl : Hj\n⊗ Hi4\nHi\ni\nl ⊗ Hl\ni1i2i3\ni1i2\nji3 →\ni2i3\nare called 6j-symbols because they depend on six indices.\nExample 1.42.6. Let C be the category of finite dimensional repre\nsentations of the Lie algebra sl2(C). Then the spaces Hij\nl are 0- or\n1-dimensional. In fact, it is obvious from the Clebsch-Gordan rule that\nthe map (Φi\ni\n1i2i3 )jl is a map between nonzero (i.e., 1-dimensional) spaces\nif and only if the numbers i1, i2, i3, i4, j, l are edge lengths of a tetrahe\ndron with faces corresponding to the four H-spaces (i1i2j, ji3i4,i1li4,\ni2i3l, such that the perimeter of every face is even (this tetrahedron\nis allowed to be in the Euclidean 3-space, Euclidean plane, or hyper\nbolic 3-space, so the only conditions are the triangle inequalities on\nthe faces). In this case, the 6j-symbol can be regarded as a number,\nprovided we choose a basis vector in every non-zero Hij\nl . Under an ap\npropriate normalization of basis vectors these numbers are the Racah\ncoefficients or classical 6j-symbols. More generally, if C = Uq (sl2),\nwhere q is not a root of unity, then the numbers (Φi\ni\n1i2i3 )jl are called\nq-Racah coefficients or quantum 6j-symbols [CFS].\nFurther, the evaluation and coevaluation maps define elements\n(1.42.6)\nαij ∈ (Hii\nj\n∗ )∗\nand\nβij ∈ Hii\nj\n∗ , j ∈ I0.\nNow the axioms of a rigid monoidal category, i.e., the triangle and\npentagon identities and the rigidity axioms translate into non-linear al\ngebraic equations with respect to the 6j-symbols (Φi\ni\n1i2i3 )jl and vectors\nαij , βij .\nExercise 1.42.7. Write down explicitly the relation on 6j symbols\ncoming from the pentagon identity. If C = Rep(sl2(C)) this relation is\ncalled the Elliott-Biedenharn relation ([CFS]).\nProposition 1.42.4 gives rise to the following general problem of cat\negorification of based rings which is one of the main problems in the\nstructure theory of tensor categories.\nProblem 1.42.8. Given a based ring R, describe (up to equivalence)\nall multitensor categories over k whose Grothendieck ring is isomorphic\nto R.\n\nIt is clear from the above explanations that this problem is equiva\nlent to finding all solutions of the system of algebraic equations coming\nfrom the axioms of the rigid monoidal category modulo the group of au\ntomorphisms of the spaces Hij\nk (\"gauge transformations\"). In general,\nthis problem is very difficult because the system of equations involved\nis nonlinear, contains many unknowns and is usually over-determined.\nIn particular, it is not clear a priori whether for a given R this sys\ntem has at least one solution, and if it does, whether the set of these\nsolutions is finite. It is therefore amazing that the theory of tensor\ncategories allows one to solve the categorification problem in a number\nof nontrivial cases. This will be done in later parts of these notes; now\nwe will only mention the simplest result in this direction, which follows\nfrom the results of Subsection 1.7.\nLet Z[G] be the group ring of a group G, with basis {g ∈ G} and\ninvolution g∗ = g-1 . Clearly, Z[G] is a unital based ring.\nProposition 1.42.9. The categorifications of Z[G] are Vecω\nG, and they\nare parametrized by H3(G, k×)/Out(G).\nRemark 1.42.10. It is tempting to say that any Z+-ring R has a\ncanonical categorification over any field k: one can take the skeletal\nsemisimple category C = CR over k whose Grothendieck group is R,\ndefine the tensor product functor on C according to the multiplication\nin R, and then \"define\" the associativity isomorphism to be the identity\n(which appears to make sense because the category is skeletal, and\ntherefore by the associativity of R one has (X ⊗Y )⊗Z = X ⊗(Y ⊗Z)).\nHowever, a more careful consideration shows that this approach does\nnot actually work. Namely, such \"associativity isomorphism\" fails to\nbe functorial with respect to morphisms; in other words, if g : Y\nY is\n→\na morphism, then (IdX ⊗g)⊗IdZ is not always equal to IdX ⊗(g ⊗IdZ ).\nTo demonstrate this explicitly, denote the simple objects of the cat\negory C by Xi, i = 1, ..., r, and let Xi ⊗ Xj = ⊕kNij\nl Xl. Take X = Xi,\nY = mXj , and Z = Xl; then g is an m by m matrix over k. The alge\nbra End((X ⊗ Y ) ⊗ Z) = End(X ⊗ (Y ⊗ Z)) is equal to ⊕sMatmns (k),\nwhere\nX\nX\nns =\nNij\np Npl\ns =\nNiq\ns Njl\nq ,\np\nq\nand in this algebra we have\n(IdX ⊗ g) ⊗ IdZ = ⊕p\nr\n=1IdN p ⊗ g ⊗ IdNs ,\nij\npl\nIdX ⊗ (g ⊗ IdZ ) = ⊕r\nIdNs\n,\nq=1\niq ⊗ g ⊗ IdN q\njl\nWe see that these two matrices are, in general, different, which shows\nthat the identity \"associativity isomorphism\" is not functorial.\n\nP\nY\n1.43. Semisimplicity of multifusion rings.\nDefinition 1.43.1. A ∗-algebra is an associative algebra B over C\nwith an antilinear anti-involution ∗ : B\nB and a linear functional\n→\nτ : B\nC such that τ(ab) = τ(ba), and the Hermitian form τ(ab∗) is\n→\npositive definite.\nObviously, any semisimple algebra B = ⊕r Mati(C) is a ∗-algebra.\ni=1\nNamely, if pi > 0 are any positive numbers for i = 1, ..., r then one\ncan define ∗ to be the usual hermitian adjoint of matrices, and set\nτ(a1, ..., ar) =\ni piTr(ai). Conversely, it is easy to see that any 8\nalgebra structure on a finite dimensional semisimple algebra has this\nform up to an isomorphism (and the numbers pi are uniquely deter\nmined, as traces of central idempotents of B).\nIt turns out that this is the most general example of a finite dimen\nsional ∗-algebra. Namely, we have\nProposition 1.43.2. Any finite dimensional ∗-algebra B is semisim\nple.\nProof. If M ⊂ B is a subbimodule, and M ⊥ is the orthogonal comple\nment of M under the form τ(ab∗), then M ⊥ is a subbimodule of B,\nand M ∩ M ⊥ = 0 because of the positivity of the form. So we have\nB = M ⊕ M ⊥. Thus B is a semisimple B-bimodule, which implies the\nproposition.\n\nCorollary 1.43.3. If e is a nonzero idempotent in a finite dimensional\n∗-algebra B then τ(e) > 0.\nThe following proposition is obvious.\nProposition 1.43.4. Let A be a based ring. Then the algebra A ⊗Z C\nis canonically a ∗-algebra.\nCorollary 1.43.5. Let A be a multifusion ring. Then the algebra\nA ⊗Z C is semsimiple.\nCorollary 1.43.6. Let X be a basis element of a fusion ring A. Then\nthere exists n > 0 such that τ(Xn) > 0.\nProof. Since τ(Xn(X∗)n) > 0 for all n > 0, X is not nilpotent. Let\nr\nq(x) :=\n(x - ai)mi\ni=0\n\nY\nP\nbe the minimal polynomial of X (ai are distinct). Assume that a0 = 0\n(we can do so since X is not nilpotent). Let\nr\ng(t) =\n(x - ai)mi xh(x),\ni=1\nwhere h is a polynomial chosen in such a way that g(a0) = 1, g(j)(a0) =\n0 for j = 1, ..., m0 - 1 (this is clearly possible). Then g(X) is an\nidempotent, so by Corollary 1.43.3, τ(g(X)) > 0. Hence there exists\nn > 0 such that τ(Xn) = 0, as desired.\n\n1.44. The Frobenius-Perron theorem. The following classical the\norem from linear algebra [Ga, XIII.2] plays a crucial role in the theory\nof tensor categories.\nTheorem 1.44.1. Let B be a square matrix with nonnegative entries.\n(1) B has a nonnegative real eigenvalue. The largest nonnegative\nreal eigenvalue λ(B) of B dominates the absolute values of all\nother eigenvalues μ of B: |μ| ≤ λ(B) (in other words, the spec\ntral radius of B is an eigenvalue). Moreover, there is an eigen\nvector of B with nonnegative entries and eigenvalue λ(B).\n(2) If B has strictly positive entries then λ(B) is a simple positive\neigenvalue, and the corresponding eigenvector can be normalized\nto have strictly positive entries. Moreover, |μ| < λ(B) for any\nother eigenvalue μ of B.\n(3) If B has an eigenvector v with strictly positive entries, then the\ncorresponding eigenvalue is λ(B).\nProof. Let B be an n by n matrix with nonnegative entries. Let us first\nshow that B has a nonnegative eigenvalue. If B has an eigenvector v\nwith nonnegative entries and eigenvalue 0, then there is nothing to\nprove. Otherwise, let Σ be the set of column vectors x ∈ Rn with\nwith nonnegative entries xi and s(x) :=\nxi equal to 1 (this is a\nsimplex). Define a continuous map fB : Σ → Σ by fB(x) = s(\nB\nB\nx\nx) . By\nthe Brouwer fixed point theorem, this map has a fixed point f. Then\nBf = λf, where λ > 0. Thus the eigenvalue λ(B) is well defined, and\nB always has a nonnegative eigenvector f with eigenvalue λ = λ(B).\nNow assume that B has strictly positive entries. Then f must have\nstrictly positive entries fi. If d is another real eigenvector of B with\neigenvalue λ, let z be the smallest of the numbers of di/fi. Then the\nvector v = d - zf satisfies Bv = λv, has nonnegative entries and has\none entry equal to zero. Hence v = 0 and λ is a simple eigenvalue.\n\nP\nX X\nX\nP\nNow let y = (y1, ..., yn) ∈ Cn be a row vector. Define the norm\n|y| :=\n|yj|fj . Then\n|yB| =\n|\nyibij |fj ≤\n|yi|bij fj = λ|y|,\nj\ni\ni,j\nand the equality holds if and only if all the complex numbers\nyibij\nwhich are nonzero have the same argument. So if yB = μy, then\n|μ| ≤ λ, and if |μ| = λ then all yi which are nonzero have the same\nargument, so we can renormalize y to have nonnegative entries. This\nimplies that μ = λ. Thus, part (2) is proved.\nNow consider the general case (B has nonnegative entries). Assume\nthat B has a row eigenevector y with strictly positive entries and eigen\nvalue μ. Then\nμyf = yBf = λyf,\nwhich implies μ = λ, as yf = 0. This implies (3).\nIt remains to finish the proof of part (1) (i.e. to prove that λ(B)\ndominates all other eigenvalues of B). Let ΓB be the oriented graph\nwhose vertices are labeled by 1, ..., n, and there is an edge from j to\ni if and only if bij > 0. Let us say that i is accessible from j if there\nis a path in ΓB leading from j to i. Let us call B irreducible if any\nvertex is accessible from any other. By conjugating B by a permutation\nmatrix if necessary, we can get to a situation when i ≥ j implies that\ni is accessible from j. This means that B is a block upper triangular\nmatrix, whose diagonal blocks are irreducible. So it suffices to prove\nthe statement in question for irreducible B.\nBut if B is irreducible, then for some N the matrix 1 + B +\n+ BN\n· · ·\nhas strictly positive entries. So the nonnegative eigenvector f of B\nwith eigenvalue λ(B) is actually strictly positive, and one can run the\nargument in the proof of part (2) with a norm bound (all that is used\nin this argument is the positivity of f). Hence, the result follows from\n(2).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.769 Topics in Lie Theory: Tensor Categories\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

We will say that A is transitive if for any X, Z ∈ I\nthere exist Y1, Y2 ∈ I such that XY1 and Y2X involve Z with a nonzero\ncoefficient.\nProposition 1.45.2. If C is a ring category with right duals then Gr(C)\nis a transitive unital Z+-ring.\nProof. Recall from Theorem 1.15.8 that the unit object 1 in C is simple.\nSo Gr(C) is unital. This implies that for any simple objects X, Z of C,\nthe object X ⊗ X∗ ⊗ Z contains Z as a composition factor (as X ⊗ X∗\ncontains 1 as a composition factor), so one can find a simple object\nY1 occurring in X∗ ⊗ Z such that Z occurs in X ⊗ Y1. Similarly, the\nobject Z ⊗ X∗ ⊗ X contains Z as a composition factor, so one can find\na simple object Y2 occurring in Z ⊗ X∗ such that Z occurs in Y2 ⊗ X.\nThus Gr(C) is transitive.\n\nLet A be a transitive unital Z+-ring of finite rank. Define the group\nhomomorphism FPdim : A → C as follows. For X ∈ I, let FPdim(X) be\nthe maximal nonnegative eigenvalue of the matrix of left multiplication\nby X. It exists by the Frobenius-Perron theorem, since this matrix has\nnonnegative entries. Let us extend FPdim from the basis I to A by\nadditivity.\nDefinition 1.45.3. The function FPdim is called the Frobenius-Perron\ndimension.\nIn particular, if C is a ring category with right duals and finitely many\nsimple objects, then we can talk about Frobenius-Perron dimensions of\nobjects of C.\nProposition 1.45.4. Let X ∈ I.\n(1) The number α = FPdim(X) is an algebraic integer, and for any\nalgebraic conjugate α0 of α we have α ≥|α0|.\n(2) FPdim(X) ≥ 1.\nProof. (1) Note that α is an eigenvalue of the integer matrix NX of left\nmultiplication by X, hence α is an algebraic integer. The number α0 is\na root of the characteristic polynomial of NX , so it is also an eigenvalue\nof NX . Thus by the Frobenius-Perron theorem α ≥|α0|.\n(2) Let r be the number of algebraic conjugates of α. Then αr ≥\nN(α) where N(α) is the norm of α. This implies the statement since\nN(α) ≥ 1.\n\nP\nP\nP\nProposition 1.45.5.\n(1) The function FPdim : A\nC is a ring\n→\nhomomorphism.\n(2) There exists a unique, up to scaling, element R ∈ AC := A⊗Z C\nsuch that XR = FPdim(X)R, for all X ∈ A. After an appro\npriate normalization this element has positive coefficients, and\nsatisfies FPdim(R) > 0 and RY = FPdim(Y )R, Y ∈ A.\n(3) FPdim is a unique nonzero character of A which takes non\nnegative values on I.\n(4) If X ∈ A has nonnegative coefficients with respect to the basis of\nA, then FPdim(X) is the largest nonnegative eigenvalue λ(NX )\nof the matrix NX of multiplication by X.\nProof. Consider the matrix M of right multiplication by\nX∈I X in A\nin the basis I. By transitivity, this matrix has strictly positive entries,\nso by the Frobenius-Perron theorem, part (2), it has a unique, up to\nscaling, eigenvector R ∈ AC with eigenvalue λ(M) (the maximal posi\ntive eigenvalue of M). Furthermore, this eigenvector can be normalized\nto have strictly positive entries.\nSince R is unique, it satisfies the equation XR = d(X)R for some\nfunction d : A\nC. Indeed, XR is also an eigenvector of M with\n→\neigenvalue λ(M), so it must be proportional to R. Furthermore, it\nis clear that d is a character of A. Since R has positive entries,\nd(X) = FPdim(X) for X ∈ I. This implies (1). We also see that\nFPdim(X) > 0 for X ∈ I (as R has strictly positive coefficients), and\nhence FPdim(R) > 0.\nNow, by transitivity, R is the unique, up to scaling, solution of the\nsystem of linear equations XR = FPdim(X)R (as the matrix N of left\nmultiplication by\nX∈I X also has positive entries). Hence, RY =\nd0(Y )R for some character d0. Applying FPdim to both sides and using\nthat FPdim(R) > 0, we find d0 = FPdim, proving (2).\nIf χ is another character of A taking positive values on I, then the\nvector with entries χ(Y ), Y ∈ I is an eigenvector of the matrix N of the\nleft multiplication by the element\nX∈I X. Because of transitivity of\nA the matrix N has positive entries. By the Frobenius-Perron theorem\nthere exists a positive number λ such that χ(Y ) = λ FPdim(Y ). Since\nχ is a character, λ = 1, which completes the proof.\nFinally, part (4) follows from part (2) and the Frobenius-Perron the\norem (part (3)).\n\nExample 1.45.6. Let C be the category of finite dimensional repre\nsentations of a quasi-Hopf algebra H, and A be its Grothendieck ring.\nThen by Proposition 1.10.9, for any X, Y ∈C\ndim Hom(X ⊗ H, Y ) = dim Hom(H, ∗X ⊗ Y ) = dim(X) dim(Y ),\n\nX\nX\n\nwhere H is the regular representation of H. Thus X ⊗ H = dim(X)H,\nso FPdim(X) = dim(X) for all X, and R = H up to scaling.\nThis example motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 1.45.7. The element R will be called a regular element of\nA.\nProposition 1.45.8. Let A be as above and ∗ : I\nI be a bijection\n→\nwhich extends to an anti-automorphism of A. Then FPdim is invariant\nunder ∗.\nProof. Let X ∈ I. Then the matrix of right multiplication by X∗ is\nthe transpose of the matrix of left multiplication by X modified by\nthe permutation ∗. Thus the required statement follows from Proposi\ntion 1.45.5(2).\n\nCorollary 1.45.9. Let C be a ring category with right duals and finitely\nmany simple objects, and let X be an object in C. If FPdim(X) = 1\nthen X is invertible.\nProof. By Exercise 1.15.10(d) it is sufficient to show that X ⊗ X∗ =\n1. This follows from the facts that 1 is contained in X ⊗ X∗ and\nFPdim(X ⊗ X∗) = FPdim(X) FPdim(X∗) = 1.\n\nProposition 1.45.10. Let f : A1 → A2 be a unital homomorphism of\ntransitive unital Z+-rings of finite rank, whose matrix in their Z+-bases\nhas non-negative entries. Then\n(1) f preserves Frobenius-Perron dimensions.\n(2) Let I1, I2 be the Z+-bases of A1, A2, and suppose that for any\nY in I2 there exists X ∈ I1 such that the coefficient of Y in\nf(X) is non-zero. If R is a regular element of A1 then f(R) is\na regular element of A2.\nProof. (1) The function X 7→ FPdim(f(X)) is a nonzero character of\nA1 with nonnegative values on the basis. By Proposition 1.45.5(3),\nFPdim(f(X)) = FPdim(X) for all X in I. (2) By part (1) we have\n(1.45.1)\nf(\nX)f(R1) = FPdim(f(\nX))f(R1).\nP\nX∈I1\nX∈I1\nBut f(\nX∈I1 X) has strictly positive coefficients in I2, hence f(R1) =\nβR2 for some β > 0. Applying FPdim to both sides, we get the result.\nCorollary 1.45.11. Let C and D be tensor categories with finitely\nmany classes of simple objects. If F : C →D be a quasi-tensor functor,\nthen FPdimD(F (X)) = FPdimC (X) for any X in C.\n\nP\nM\nExample 1.45.12. (Tambara-Yamagami fusion rings) Let G be a fi\nnite group, and TYG be an extension of the unital based ring Z[G]:\nTYG := Z[G] ⊕ ZX,\nwhere X is a new basis vector with gX = Xg = X, X2 =\ng∈G g. This\nis a fusion ring, with X∗ = X. It is easy to see that FPdim(g) = 1,\nFPdim(X) = |G|1/2 . We will see later that these rings are categorifiable\nif and only if G is abelian.\nExample 1.45.13. (Verlinde rings for sl2). Let k be a nonnegative\ninteger. Define a unital Z+-ring Verk = Verk(sl2) with basis Vi, i =\n0, ..., k (V0 = 1), with duality given by Vi\n∗ = Vi and multiplication\ngiven by the truncated Clebsch-Gordan rule:\nmin(i+j,2k-(i+j))\n(1.45.2)\nVi ⊗ Vj =\nVl.\nl=|i-j|,i+j-l∈2Z\nIt other words, one computes the product by the usual Clebsch-Gordan\nrule, and then deletes the terms that are not defined (Vi with i > k) and\nalso their mirror images with respect to point k +1. We will show later\nthat this ring admits categorifications coming from quantum groups at\nroots of unity.\nNote that Ver0 = Z, Ver1 = Z[Z2], Ver2 = TYZ2 . The latter is\ncalled the Ising fusion ring, as it arises in the Ising model of statistical\nmechanics.\nExercise 1.45.14. Show that FPdim(Vj ) = [j+1]q := qj+1-q-j-1 , where\nq-q-1\nπi\nq = e k+2 .\nNote that the Verlinde ring has a subring Ver0\nk spanned by Vj with\neven j. If k = 3, this ring has basis 1, X = V2 with X2 = X + 1, X∗ =\nX. This ring is called the Yang-Lee fusion ring. In the Yang-Lee ring,\nFPdim(X) is the golden ratio 1+\n√\n5 .\nNote that one can define the generalized Yang-Lee fusion rings Y Ln\nn ∈ Z+, with basis 1, X, multiplication X2 = 1+nX and duality X∗ =\nX. It is, however, shown in [O2] that these rings are not categorifiable\nwhen n > 1.\nProposition 1.45.15. (Kronecker) Let B be a matrix with nonnegative\ninteger entries, such that λ(BBT ) = λ(B)2 . If λ(B) < 2 then λ(B) =\n2 cos(π/n) for some integer n ≥ 2.\nProof. Let λ(B) = q + q-1 . Then q is an algebraic integer, and |q| =\n1. Moreover, all conjugates of λ(B)2 are nonnegative (since they are\n\neigenvalues of the matrix BBT , which is symmetric and nonnegative\ndefinite), so all conjugates of λ(B) are real. Thus, if q∗ is a conjugate of\nq then q∗ +q-1 is real with absolute value < 2 (by the Frobenius-Perron\n∗\ntheorem), so |q∗| = 1. By a well known result in elementary algebraic\nnumber theory, this implies that q is a root of unity: q = e2πik/m, where\nk and m are coprime. By the Frobenius-Perron theorem, so k = ±1,\nand m is even (indeed, if m = 2p + 1 is odd then |qp + q-p| > |q + q-1|).\nSo q = eπi/n for some integer n ≥ 2, and we are done.\n\nCorollary 1.45.16. Let A be a fusion ring, and X ∈ A a basis ele\nment. Then if F P dim(X) < 2 then F P dim(X) = 2cos(π/n), for some\ninteger n ≥ 3.\nProof. This follows from Proposition 1.45.15, since F P dim(XX∗) =\nF P dim(X)2 .\n\n1.46. Deligne's tensor product of finite abelian categories. Let\nC, D be two finite abelian categories over a field k.\nDefinition 1.46.1. Deligne's tensor product C D is an abelian cat\negory which is universal for the functor assigning to every k-linear\nabelian category A the category of right exact in both variables bilin\near bifunctors C × D →A. That is, there is a bifunctor : C × D →\nC D : (X, Y ) 7→ X Y which is right exact in both variables and is\nsuch that for any right exact in both variables bifunctor F : C×D → A\nthere exists a unique right exact functor F : C D →A satisfying\nF\n= F .\n*\nProposition 1.46.2. (cf. [D, Proposition 5.13]) (i) The tensor product\nC D exists and is a finite abelian category.\n(ii) It is unique up to a unique equivalence.\n(iii) Let C, D be finite dimensional algebras and let C = C - mod\nand D = D - mod. Then C D = C ⊗ D - mod.\n(iv) The bifunctor is exact in both variables and satisfies\nHomC(X1, Y1) ⊗ HomD(X2, Y2) ∼= HomCD(X1 X2, Y1 Y2).\n(v) any bilinear bifunctor F : C × D →A exact in each variable\ndefines an exact functor F : C D →A.\nProof. (sketch). (ii) follows from the universal property in the usual\nway.\n(i) As we know, a finite abelian category is equivalent to the category\nof finite dimensional modules over an algebra. So there exist finite\ndimensional algebras C, D such that C = C - mod, D = D - mod.\nThen one can define C D = C ⊗ D - mod, and it is easy to show that\n\nP\nit satisfies the required conditions. This together with (ii) also implies\n(iii).\n(iv),(v) are routine.\n\nA similar result is valid for locally finite categories.\nDeligne's tensor product can also be applied to functors. Namely, if\nF : C →C0 and G : D →D0 are additive right exact functors between\nfinite abelian categories then one can define the functor F G : CD →\nC0 D0.\nProposition 1.46.3. If C, D are multitensor categories then the cate\ngory C D has a natural structure of a multitensor category.\nProof. Let X1 Y1, X2 Y2 ∈C D. Then we can set\n(X1 Y1) ⊗ (X2 Y2) := (X1 ⊗ X2) (Y1 Y2).\nand define the associativity isomorphism in the obvious way. This\ndefines a structure of a monoidal category on the subcategory of C\nD consisting of \"-decomposable\" objects of the form X Y . But\nany object of C D admits a resolution by -decomposable injective\nobjects. This allows us to use a standard argument with resolutions to\nextend the tensor product to the entire category C D. It is easy to see\nthat if C, D are rigid, then so is C D, which implies the statement.\n1.47. Finite (multi)tensor categories. In this subsection we will\nstudy general properties of finite multitensor and tensor categories.\nRecall that in a finite abelian category, every simple object X has a\nprojective cover P (X). The object P (X) is unique up to a non-unique\nisomorphism. For any Y in C one has\n(1.47.1)\ndim Hom(P (X), Y ) = [Y : X].\nLet K0(C) denote the free abelian group generated by isomorphism\nclasses of indecomposable projective objects of a finite abelian category\nC. Elements of K0(C) ⊗Z C will be called virtual projective objects. We\nhave an obvious homomorphism γ : K0(C)\nGr(C). Although groups\n→\nK0(C) and Gr(C) have the same rank, in general γ is neither surjective\nnor injective even after tensoring with C. The matrix C of γ in the\nnatural basis is called the Cartan matrix of C; its entries are [P (X) : Y ],\nwhere X, Y are simple objects of C.\nNow let C be a finite multitensor category, let I be the set of isomor\nphism classes of simple objects of C, and let i∗, ∗i denote the right and\nleft duals to i, respectively. Let Gr(C) be the Grothendieck ring of C,\nspanned by isomorphism classes of the simple objects Xi, i ∈ I. In this\nring, we have XiXj =\nk Nij\nk Xk, where Nij\nk are nonnegative integers.\nAlso, let Pi denote the projective covers of Xi.\n\nX\nX\nProposition 1.47.1. Let C be a finite multitensor category. Then\nK0(C) is a Gr(C)-bimodule.\nProof. This follows from the fact that the tensor product of a projective\nobject with any object is projective, Proposition 1.13.6.\n\nLet us describe this bimodule explicitly.\nProposition 1.47.2. For any object Z of C,\n= ⊕j,kN i\n= ⊕j,kN i\nPi ⊗ Z ∼\nkj∗ [Z : Xj ]Pk, Z ⊗ Pi ∼\n∗jk[Z : Xj ]Pk.\nProof. Hom(Pi ⊗ Z, Xk) = Hom(Pi, Xk ⊗ Z∗), and the first formula\nfollows from Proposition 1.13.6. The second formula is analogous.\nProposition 1.47.3. Let P be a projective object in a multitensor\ncategory C. Then P ∗ is also projective. Hence, any projective object in\na multitensor category is also injective.\nProof. We need to show that the functor Hom(P ∗, ) is exact. This\n-\nfunctor is isomorphic to Hom(1, P ⊗-). The functor P ⊗- is exact\nand moreover, by Proposition 1.13.6, any exact sequence splits after\ntensoring with P , as an exact sequence consisting of projective objects.\nThe Proposition is proved.\n\nProposition 1.47.3 implies that an indecomposable projective object\nP has a unique simple subobject, i.e. that the socle of P is simple.\nFor any finite tensor category C define an element RC ∈ K0(C) ⊗Z C\nby\n(1.47.2)\nR =\nFPdim(Xi)Pi.\nC\ni∈I\nDefinition 1.47.4. The virtual projective object RC is called the reg\nular object of C.\nDefinition 1.47.5. Let C be a finite tensor category. Then the Frobenius-\nPerron dimension of C is defined by\n(1.47.3)\nFPdim(C) := FPdim(RC) =\nFPdim(Xi) FPdim(Pi).\ni∈I\nExample 1.47.6. Let H be a finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra.\nThen FPdim(Rep(H)) = dim(H).\nProposition 1.47.7.\n(1) Z ⊗ RC = RC ⊗ Z = FPdim(Z)RC for all\nZ ∈ Gr(C).\n(2) The image of RC in Gr(C) ⊗Z C is a regular element.\n\n-\n-\nP\nP\nP\nProof. We have\nFPdim(Xi) dim Hom(Pi, Z) = FPdim(Z) for any ob\ni\nject Z of C.\nX\nHence,\nX\nFPdim(Xi) dim Hom(Pi ⊗ Z, Y ) =\nFPdim(Xi) dim Hom(Pi, Y ⊗ Z∗)\ni\ni\n= FPdim(Y ⊗ Z∗)\n= FPdim(Y ) FPdim(Z∗)\n= FPdim(Y ) FPdim(Z)\nX\n= FPdim(Z)\nFPdim(Xi) dim Hom(Pi, Y ).\ni\nNow, P (X)⊗Z are projective objects by Proposition 1.13.6. Hence, the\nformal sums\nFPdim(Xi)Pi⊗Z = RC⊗Z and FPdim(Z)\nFPdim(Xi)Pi =\ni\ni\nFPdim(Z)RC are linear combinations of Pj , j ∈ I with the same coeffi\ncients.\n\nRemark 1.47.8. We note the following useful inequality:\n(1.47.4)\nFPdim(C) ≥ N FPdim(P ),\nwhere N is the number of simple objects in C, and P is the projective\ncover of the neutral object 1. Indeed, for any simple object V the\nprojective object P (V ) ⊗ ∗V has a nontrivial homomorphism to 1, and\nhence contains P . So FPdim(P (V )) FPdim(V ) ≥ FPdim(P ). Adding\nthese inequalities over all simple V , we get the result.\n1.48. Integral tensor categories.\nDefinition 1.48.1. A transitive unital Z+-ring A of finite rank is said\nto be integral if FPdim : A\nZ (i.e. the Frobenius-Perron dimnensions\n→\nof elements of C are integers). A tensor category C is integral if Gr(C)\nis integral.\nProposition 1.48.2. A finite tensor category C is integral if and only\nif C is equivalent to the representation category of a finite dimensional\nquasi-Hopf algebra.\nProof. The \"if\" part is clear from Example 1.45.6. To prove the \"only\nif\" part, it is enough to construct a quasi-fiber functor on C. Define\nP = ⊕i FPdim(Xi)Pi, where Xi are the simple objects of C, and Pi\nare their projective covers. Define F = Hom(P, ). Obviously, F is\n-\nexact and faithful, F (1) ∼= 1, and dim F (X) = FPdim(X) for all X ∈\nC. Using Proposition 1.46.2, we continue the functors F (- ⊗-) and\nF ( ) ⊗ F ( ) to the functors C C → Vec. Both of these functors are\nexact and take the same values on the simple objects of C C. Thus\nthese functors are isomorphic and we are done.\n\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nCorollary 1.48.3. The assignment H 7→ Rep(H) defines a bijection\nbetween integral finite tensor categories C over k up to monoidal equiva\nlence, and finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebras H over k, up to twist\nequivalence and isomorphism.\n1.49. Surjective quasi-tensor functors. Let C, D be abelian cate\ngories. Let F : C →D be an additive functor.\nDefinition 1.49.1. We will say that F is surjective if any object of D\nis a subquotient in F (X) for some X ∈C. 13\nExercise 1.49.2. Let A, B be coalgebras, and f : A\nB a homomor\n→\nphism. Let F = f ∗ : A - comod → B - comod be the corresponding\npushforward functor. Then F is surjective if and only if f is surjective.\nNow let C, D be finite tensor categories.\nTheorem 1.49.3. ([EO]) Let F : C →D be a surjective quasi-tensor\nfunctor. Then F maps projective objects to projective ones.\nProof. Let C be a finite tensor category, and X ∈C. Let us write\nX as a direct sum of indecomposable objects (such a representation\nis unique). Define the projectivity defect p(X) of X to be the sum\nof Frobenius-Perron dimensions of all the non-projective summands in\nthis sum (this is well defined by the Krull-Schmidt theorem). It is clear\nthat p(X ⊕ Y ) = p(X) + p(Y ). Also, it follows from Proposition 1.13.6\nthat p(X ⊗ Y ) ≤ p(X)p(Y ).\nLet Pi be the indecomposable projective objects in C. Let Pi ⊗ Pj ∼=\n⊕kBk Pk, and let Bi be the matrix with entries Bk Also, let B =\nBi.\nij\nij .\nObviously, B has strictly positive entries, and the Frobenius-Perron\neigenvalue of B is\ni FPdim(Pi).\nOn the other hand, let F : C →D be a surjective quasi-tensor functor\nbetween finite tensor categories. Let pj = Pp(F (Pj )), and Pp be the vector\nwith entries pj . Then we get pipj\nBk\nso (\npi)p ≥ Bp.\n≥\nk\nij pk,\ni\nSo, either pi are all zero, or they are all positive, and the norm of\nB with respect to the norm |x| =\npi|xi| is at most\npi. Since\npi ≤ FPdim(Pi), this implies pi = FPdim(Pi) for all i (as the largest\neigenvalue of B is\ni FPdim(Pi)).\nAssume the second option is the case. Then F (Pi) do not contain\nnonzero projective objects as direct summands, and hence for any pro\njective P ∈C, F (P ) cannot contain a nonzero projective object as a\ndirect summand. However, let Q be a projective object of D. Then,\n13This definition does not coincide with a usual categorical definition of surjec\ntivity of functors which requires that every object of D be isomorphic to some F (X)\nfor an object X in C.\n\nsince F is surjective, there exists an object X ∈C such that Q is a\nsubquotient of F (X). Since any X is a quotient of a projective object,\nand F is exact, we may assume that X = P is projective. So Q occurs\nas a subquotient in F (P ). As Q is both projective and injective, it is\nactually a direct summand in F (P ). Contradiction.\nThus, pi = 0 and F (Pi) are projective. The theorem is proved.\n\n1.50. Categorical freeness. Let C, D be finite tensor categories, and\nF : C →D be a quasi-tensor functor.\nTheorem 1.50.1. One has\nFPdim(C)\n(1.50.1)\nF (RC ) = FPdim(D) RD.\nProof. By Theorem 1.49.3, F (RC) is a virtually projective object. Thus,\nF (RC ) must be proportional to RD, since both (when written in the ba\nsis Pi) are eigenvectors of a matrix with strictly positive entries with its\nFrobenius-Perron eigenvalue. (For this matrix we may take the matrix\nof multiplication by F (X), where X is such that F (X) contains as com\nposition factors all simple objects of D; such exists by the surjectivity\nof F ). The coefficient is obtained by computing the Frobenius-Perron\ndimensions of both sides.\n\nCorollary 1.50.2. In the above situation, one has FPdim(C) ≥ FPdim(D),\nand FPdim(D) divides FPdim(C) in the ring of algebraic integers. In\nfact,\nFPdim(C)\nX\n(1.50.2)\nFPdim(D) =\nFPdim(Xi) dim Hom(F (Pi), 1D),\nwhere Xi runs over simple objects of C.\nProof. The statement is obtained by computing the dimension of Hom(-, 1D)\nfor both sides of (1.50.1).\n\nSuppose now that C is integral, i.e., by Proposition 1.48.2, it is the\nrepresentation category of a quasi-Hopf algebra H. In this case, RC\nis an honest (not only virtual) projective object of C, namely the free\nrank 1 module over H. Theorefore, multiples of RC are free H-modules\nof finite rank, and vice versa.\nThen Theorem 1.49.3 and the fact that F (RC ) is proportional to RD\nimplies the following categorical freeness result.\nCorollary 1.50.3. If C is integral, and F : C →D is a surjective\nquasi-tensor functor then D is also integral, and the object F (RC) is\nfree of rank FPdim(C)/ FPdim(D) (which is an integer).\n\nProof. The Frobenius-Perron dimensions of simple objects of D are\ncoordinates of the unique eigenvector of the positive integer matrix of\nmultiplication by F (RC ) with integer eigenvalue FPdim(C), normalized\nso that the component of 1 is 1. Thus, all coordinates of this vector are\nrational numbers, hence integers (because they are algebraic integers).\nThis implies that the category D is integral. The second statement is\nclear from the above.\n\nCorollary 1.50.4. ([Scha]; for the semisimple case see [ENO1]) A\nfinite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra is a free module over its quasi-\nHopf subalgebra.\nRemark 1.50.5. In the Hopf case Corollary 1.50.3 is well known and\nmuch used; it is due to Nichols and Zoeller [NZ].\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.769 Topics in Lie Theory: Tensor Categories\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
