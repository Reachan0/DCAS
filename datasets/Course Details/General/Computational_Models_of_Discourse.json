Shifting\nShifting the center, if it is neither retained no continued\n- Cb(Un+1) <> Cb(Un)\nLexical Cohesion and Coherence\n31/34\n\nCoherent Discourse\nCoherence is established via center continuation\nJohn went to his favorite music\nstore to buy a piano.\nHe had frequented the store for\nmany years.\nHe was excited that he could fi-\nnally buy a piano.\nHe arrived just as the store

of\nReferring Expressions\n- Selection of Referring Expressions\n- Symbolic Approaches (Dale&Reiter)\n- Corpus-Based Approaches (Radev,\nNenkova&McKeown)\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n1/34\n\nWhat is NLG?\n- Program which produces texts in natural language.\n- Input: some underlying non-linguistic\nrepresentation of information.\n- Output: documents, reports, help messages and\nother types of texts.\n- Knowledge sources required: knowledge of\nlanguage and of the domain.\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n2/34\n\nWhy to Use NLG?\n- Important information is stored in ways which are\nnot comprehensible to the end users -- databases,\nexpert system, log files.\n- NLG systems can present this information to users in\nan accessible way.\n- Data presented in textual form can be searched by\nIR systems.\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n3/34\n\nExample: Summary of basketball games\nscoring((Shaquille, O'Neal), 37)\ntime(Friday, night)\nteam((Shaquille, O'Neal), (Orlando, Magic))\nwin(Orlando, Magic), (Toronto, Raptors)\nscore(101,89)\n...\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n4/34\n\nOutput\nOrlando, FL -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 37 points Friday\nnight powering the Orlando Magic to a 101 89 victory\nover the Toronto Raptors, losers of seven in a row.\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n5/34\n\nNLG System Architecture\nContent Determination\n-\n- Discourse Planning\n- Sentence Aggregation\nLexicalization\n-\n- Syntactic and morphological realization\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n6/34\n\nContent determination\n- Input: Knowledge base.\nSchemata and Inference mechanism.\n-\n- Output: predicates to be conveyed in the text.\nExample:\nGame statistics: win(Orlando, Magic), (Toronto, Raptors)\nPlayer's records: team((Shaquille, O'Neal), (Orlando, Magic))\nTeam's record: lost(7,(Toronto, Raptors))\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n7/34\n\nDiscourse Planning\n- Text have an underlying structure in which parts are\nrelated together.\n- Rhetorical relationships.\n- Conceptual grouping.\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n8/34\n\nSentence Planning\n- A one-to-one mapping from predicates to messages\nis bad.\n- Sentence planning groups information into\nsentences (aggregation).\nBefore aggregation: Shaquille O'Neal scored 37\npoints.\nThe game was on Friday night.\nOrlando Magic defeated Toronto Raptors.\nRaptors lost seven games in a row.\nAfter aggregation: Shaquille O'Neal scored 37\npoints Friday night powering the Orlando Magic\nto a 101 89 victory over the Toronto Raptors,\nlosers of seven in a row.\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n9/34\n\nLexicalization + Syntactic Realization\n- This stage determines the particular words to be\nused to express domain concepts and relations.\n- Constraints: discourse focus, style constraints,\nsyntactic environment.\n- Implementation: decision tree.\nExample: predicate:\nwin(X, Y)\nVerb: X defeated Y, Y was defeated X, X won in the game against X, X won the game\nNoun:: victory of X over Y, victory of X, defeat of Y\n\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n10/34\n\nRealization task\nInsert function words.\n-\n- Choose correct specification of content words.\nOrder words.\n-\nFUF/SURGE input for the sentence \"John likes Mary\nnow.\"\n((cat clause)\n(proc ((type mental) (tense present) (lex \"like\")))\n(partic ((processor ((cat proper) (lex \"John\")))\n(phenomenon ((cat proper) (lex \"Mary\")))))\n(circum ((time ((cat adv) (lex \"now\"))))))\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n11/34\n\nBasics\n- A noun phrase is considered to be a referring\nexpression iff its only communicative purpose is to\nidentify an object too the hearer\nContext is the set of entities that the hearer is\n-\ncurrently assumed to be attending to\n- Referring expression satisfies the referential\ncommunicative goal if it is a distinguishing\ndescription in the given context\nExample: small black dog, large white dog, small black\ncat\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n12/34\n\nImpact of Conversational Implicature\nRedundant Information causes violations of\nConversation Implicature (Grice, 1975)\nSit by the table.\nSit by the brown wood table.\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n13/34\n\nInappropriate Modifiers\nOverly specific or unexpected classifiers violates\nprinciples of Conversation Implicature\nLook at the dog.\nLook at the pitt bull.\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n14/34\n\nPsychological Data\n(Levelt, 1989)\nPeople do include unnecessary modifiers in referring\nexpressions\na white bird, a black cup and a white cup\n- Incremental Processing Helps in Understanding\n- Redundancy Helps in Understanding\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n15/34\n\nTranscript Analysis\n(Reiter&Dale,1992) (\"assembly task\" dialog)\nWhich attribute should be used?\n-\ngender vs color vs shape\n- Is it preferable to use modifier or to use a more\nspecific head noun?\nthe small dog vs the chihuahua\n- Should relative or absolute adjectives be used?\nthe small dog vs the one foot high dog\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n16/34\n\nResults of Transcript Analysis\n- Preference for adjectives that communicate size,\nshape or color?\nthe black dog vs the male dog\n- The use of specific head nouns depends on audience\nexpertise\nthe small dog vs the chihuahua\n- Preference for relative adjectives in speech, and for\nabsolute adjectives in writing\nthe small dog vs the one foot high dog\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n17/34\n\nAlgorithm: Representation\n(Reiter&Dale,1992)\n- Input is organized in (attribute, value) pairs\n- Type is one of the attributes\n- Attributes are organized in taxonomy\nObject1: (type, chihuahua), (size, small), (color, black).\nObject2: (type, chihuahua), (size, large), (color, white).\nObject3: (type, cat), (size, small), (color, black).\n\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n18/34\n\nAlgorithm\n- Check Success: see if the contracted description\npicks up one entity from the context\n- Choose Property: determine which properties of the\nreferent would rule out the largest number of\nentities\n- Extend Description: add the chosen properties to\nthe description being constructed and remove\nrelevant entities from the discourse.\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n19/34\n\nText-to-Text Generation\n- Input: text (lack of semantic information)\n- Applications: summarization, question-answering,\nmachine translation\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n20/34\n\nSupervised Approach to Referent Selection\nGoal: Select the best entity description in a given corpus\n(Radev, 1998)\nElections (1996): \"Bill Clinton, the democratic presiden-\ntial candidate\"\nFalse bomb alert in Little Rock, Ark (1997): \"Bill Clinton,\nan Arkansas native\"\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n21/34\n\nKey Idea\n- Semantic constraints imposed on lexical choice are\nreflected in contextual indicators\n- This correlation can be learned automatically from a\nlarge collections of texts, given a feature vector and\na referent\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n22/34\n\nEntity Profile\nCollection of entity descriptions (automatically\nconstructed)\nExample: Profile of Ung Huot\na senior member, Cambodia's, Cambodian foreign minister, co-\npremier, first prime minister, foreign minister, MR., new co-\npremier, new first prime minister, newly-appointed prime minis-\nter, premier\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n23/34\n\nDistributional Properties of Profile\n- 11, 504 entities from 178 MB of newswire\n- 9, 053 have a single description\n- 2, 451 very from 2 to 24 descriptions\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n24/34\n\nFeatures\n- Context -- a bag of words surrounding the entity\n- Length of the article -- an integer\n- Name of the entity -- e.g., \"Bill Clinton\"\n- Profile -- set of all the descriptions\nWordnet -- WordNet extension for Profile members\n-\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n25/34\n\nExperimental Results\n- Training: 10, 353 Testing: 1,511\n- Precision: 88.87%, Recall 63.39%\n- Steep learning curve\n(500: 64.29%, 2.86% → 50,000: 88.87%, 63.39%)\n- Positive impact of WordNet extension -- 10%\nincrease on average\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n26/34\n\nRule Examples\nIF inflation IN CONTEXT, THEN \"politician\"\nIF detective IN PROFILE AND agency in CONTEXT,\nTHEN \"policeman\"\nIF celine IN CONTEXT, THEN \"north american\"\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n27/34\n\nUnsupervised Referent Selection\nStatistical Model of Syntactic Realization\n(Nenkova&McKeown, 2003)\nHypothesis: There is a regularity in lexical realization of\nreferent chain\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n28/34\n\nExample\nMany years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively\nfond of new clothes, that he spent all his money in dress. He did\nnot care to go either to the theatre or the chase, except for the\nopportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes.\nHe had a different suit for each hour of the day; and as of any\nother king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, \"he is sitting\nin council,\" it was always said of him, \"The Emperor is sitting in\nhis wardrobe.\" One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers,\nmade their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to\nweave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns,\nthe clothes manufactured from which should have the wonder-\nful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was extraor-\ndinarily simple in character. \"These must, indeed, be splendid\nclothes!\" thought the Emperor.\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n29/34\n\nTarget NP Features\nPremodifiers:\n-\n- Titles \"President George W. Bush\"\n- Name-external modifiers \"Irish Flutist James\nGalway\"\nPostmodifiers:\n-\n- Apposition\n- Relative Clause\n- Prepositional Phrase Modificiation\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n30/34\n\nTypes of Referents\n- Is the target named entity the head of the phrase or\nnot?\n- If it is the head what kind of pre- and post- modifier\ndies it have?\nHow was the name itself realized in the NP?\n-\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n31/34\n\nHHM Construction\n- Each state of HMM corresponds to one syntactic\nrealization\n- Transitions are estimated based on corpus counts\n(anaphoric expressions are not resolved!)\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n32/34\n\nFragment of HMM\nModification\nNo Modification\nInitial\n0.76\n0.24\nModification\n0.44\n0.56\nNo modification\n0.24\n0.75\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n33/34\n\nEvaluation\nRewriting rules based on HMM improve the\nperformance of summarization system:\nPreferences: 89% rewrite, 9% original, 2% no\npreference\nGeneration of Referring Expression\n34/34"
