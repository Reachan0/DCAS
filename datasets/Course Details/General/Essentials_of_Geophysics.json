  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nLabs: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nPhysics II (8.02), Differential Equations (\n18.03\n)\n\nDescription\n\nThis course is designed to be a survey of the various subdisciplines of geophysics (geodesy, gravity, geomagnetism, seismology, and geodynamics) and how they might relate to or be relevant for other planets. No prior background in Earth sciences is assumed, but students should be comfortable with vector calculus, classical mechanics, and potential field theory.\n\nFormally, this course has 4 contact hours a week. If enrollment allows it, the extra one-hour session will be devoted to a discussion of a recent journal article on a topic covered in the lectures; if the class size is too large this will not be feasible and the extra time will be used for a combination of resuscitation and literature discussion.\n\nTopics\n\nThe Earth in the Solar System\n\nThe Earth's Gravitational Field\n\nThe Magnetic Field of the Earth\n\nSeismology\n\nGeodynamics\n\nGrading\n\nGrades for the class will be based on the scores from (~8) homework assignments, paper discussion, and a final exam/quiz.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPercentages\n\nHomework Assignments\n\n50%\n\nPaper Discussion\n\n10%\n\nFinal Exam/Quiz\n\n40%\n\nNo mid-term exam will be given. It is expected that students will work independently on homework problems, but discussion outside class on the articles that are discussed is encouraged. (Unless indicated otherwise, homework is due one week after it is assigned.)\n\nTextbooks\n\nThis course doesn't use one single text book. For further reading, see recommended text books in the\nreadings\nsection.",

      "content": "Chapter 1\nThe Earth in the Solar\nSystem\n1.1\nSolar System Formation, Accretion, and the\nEarly Thermal State of the Earth\nTo understand the composition and early evolution of the Earth it is necessary\nto consider as far back as the formation of our solar system. Solar system\nformation was a complex process that is not well understood because of the\nlack of data and the vast physical and chemical complexities of the process.\nHowever, there are certain key parameters that we do know. As discussed in a\nlater lecture, we know from the study of meteorites the age of the solar system\nand its initial composition. And, comparatively speaking, we know much about\nthe nature of the present-day solar system. In addition, we have observations of\nold and young stars that inform us about the life cycle of the sun. The goal is to\nuse all the information in combination with the laws of physics and chemistry\nto fill in the blanks between the initial state and the present state of the solar\nsystem, and to consider what this means for the constitution and initial state\nof the Earth.\n1.2\nRotation and Angular Momentum\nAll the planets revolve in the same direction around the sun, and in practically\nthe same plane. For the most part they also rotate in the same direction about\ntheir own axes, although there are notable exceptions, such as Venus. The grav\nitational collapse of molecular clouds is widely believed to lead to star formation\nand it is likely that our solar system condensed from a collapsed, rotating cloud\nof gas and dust. Rotating disks of material are ubiquitous in space, occurring\nall the way from planetary to galactic scales. A rotating disk is the signature of\na self-gravitating system that has contracted in radius and amplified its angular\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nvelocity in order to preserve its total angular momentum. In a rotating proto\nstar the gravitational attraction everywhere will be towards the center of mass.\nBut the centrifugal force will be directed normal to the axis of rotation. The\nresolved force vector will move gas and dust nearer to the median plane as the\ncloud contracts. This process leads to the disk shape, which dissipates energy\nand minimizes collisions.\nOne of the more interesting boundary conditions is the present distribution\nof angular momentum. Consider a planet of mass m that orbits a central body\nof mass M , whose position with respect to the central body can be described\nby a vector r.\nThe orbital angular momentum (L) of the planet can be written\nL = mr 2ω = mr dθ,\n(1.1)\ndt\nwhere r is distance, m is the mass, ω is the angular velocity (=dθ/dt), and θ is\nthe angle with respect to a fixed direction in the orbit plane. It can be shown\nthat\ndθ\nL\ndS\nr\n=\n= 2\n,\n(1.2)\ndt\nm\ndt\nwhere S is the area swept out by r. Then\ndS\nL\n=\n,\n(1.3)\ndt\n2m\nwhich is a statement of Kepler's second Law of Motion: the line between\na planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal periods of time. Equation\n(1.3) is a statement of conservation of angular momentum. The total plan\netary energy (E), which is the sum of the kinetic and potential contributions1 ,\nmGM\nE = 1 mv 2 +\n= constant\n(1.4)\nr\nwhere\n\ndr\ndθ\nv =\n+ r\n(1.5)\ndt\ndt\nis the planetary velocity, is also conserved. It is possible to rewrite (1.1) in\nterms of the mass of the sun and doing so yields\n1/2\nL = mr 2ω = (GMs)1/2 mr\n.\n(1.6)\nBy integrating (1.6) over all the planets we find that while the sun contains\n99.8% of the mass of the solar system, it has only about 1% of the angular\n1 Notice that this treatment does not follow the conventional definition of gravitational\npotential as used in later chapters, U = - GM .\nr\n\n1.3. THE SUN\nmomentum. About 60% of the angular momentum of the solar system is asso\nciated with the orbit of Jupiter alone. Most models suggest that the protosun\nwas rotating more rapidly than at present. Helioseismological results show that\ndeeper parts of the sun rotate faster than the surface. The deep solar interior,\nwhich has not yet been probed, may hold the record of that body's relic ro\ntation. Solar system evolution models must show how the protosun's angular\nmomentum gets transported outward. Most models invoke magnetic and gravi\ntational torques that spin down the sun and spin up the planets. Magnetizations\nof meteorites are consistent with this idea. The transfer of angular momentum\ncould have contributed to the chemical fractionation of the solar system, since\nan outwardly migrating magnetic field would affect the ionized plasma but not\ncondensed particles, which couple to the field only by viscous drag. Thus higher\ntemperature condensates would remain in the inner part of the solar system\nand more volatile constituents would be transferred outward. In fact this is\nobserved.\n1.3\nThe Sun\nStellar Evolution: The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram\nA common method of characterizing stars is the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R)\ndiagram, which is a plot of absolute magnitude or luminosity versus effective\n(blackbody) temperature. It is traditional to plot effective temperature from\nhigh to low on the abscissa, and luminosity from dim to bright along the ordi\nnate. For two stars with the same effective temperature, more light will come\nfrom the larger star than the smaller; hence the largest stars are at the top of\nan H-R diagram.\nAs each star proceeds through its life cycle it moves around on the H-R\ndiagram. While we can't observe the life cycle of a single star, we can search\nthrough the current \"snapshot\" of our galaxy and find stars at all stages of\nevolution. Making an ensemble H-R plot reveals that many stars fall along a\nsingle line called the main sequence. Stars on the main sequence are in a\nrelatively steady state of hydrogen burning in their cores, as is the present sun.\nAn average G-type (yellow) star like our sun is thought to have a lifetime (i.e.\na residence time on the main sequence) of about 10 billion years.\nThe T-Tauri Stage\nThe conspicuous absence of gas between the planets in the solar system must be\nexplained in any model of solar system formation. Before a new star reaches the\nmain sequence it goes through a pre-main sequence evolution of gravitational\ncollapse from a protostellar nebula. Our best information about this stage\ncomes from studying a class of young stars called T Tauri stars. T Tauri\nstars are thought to be still contracting and evolving, and typically less than\none million years old. They are typically 0.2 to 2 solar masses in size, and they\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nshow evidence of strong magnetic activity. Some T Tauri stars have spectra that\ninclude \"forbidden lines\", which occur in low-density gas and are the signature\nof a gaseous nebula. Rapid fluctuations in ultraviolet and x-ray emissions are\ncommon. They also tend to show strong infrared emission and have spectra\nwith silicon lines indicating that they are surrounded by dust clouds.\nT Tauri stars are associated with strong solar winds and high luminosities.\nIt is thought that our sun probably passed through a T Tauri stage in its early\nevolution, and that the volatile elements in the inner solar system were blown\naway during this stage.\n1.4\nPlanetary Formation\nCondensation and Cooling\nThe most widely accepted cosmogonical (formation) theory is that of V. Safronov,\nwho was the first to hypothesize that the solar system initially accreted from\na nebular cloud that evolved from a sphere to a disk. While details of solar\nsystem formation models differ, a common premise is that the planets formed\nfrom particle growth in an initially tenuous dust-gas nebula. The mechanism to\ntrigger the initial collapse of the nebula has been argued and hypotheses range\nfrom uniform gravitational collapse, to galactic spiral density waves, to catas\ntrophic suggestions such as a supernova in the solar neighborhood. A supernova,\nthough a low probability event, is supported by the discovery of micro-diamonds\nin cosmic dust. These imply that the solar system environs achieved high pres\nsures due to passage of severe shock waves that would accompany only an event\nof this intensity. The problem with the supernova hypothesis is that it would\nimply that solar system formation is not a common phenomenon, which runs\ncontrary to current thought.\nThere are a number of scenarios for planetary growth. It is possible that\nthe planets accumulated from small moon-sized bodies, called planetesimals,\nby infrequent encounters. Or instead accumulation may have occurred from\ngroups of bodies that collectively became gravitationally unstable. It is not clear\nwhether planetary accumulation occurred in a gaseous or gas-free environment.\nIn a gaseous nebula temperatures tend to be homogeneous, but as gas clears\ndue to the solar wind and condensation into dust grains the opacity of the\nnebula decreases significantly. During this time the system establishes a large\ntemperature gradient.\nIt is generally accepted that the planets accreted from a nebula with a com\nposition similar to that of the sun, i.e., made mostly of hydrogen. The slowly-\nrotating nebula had a pressure and temperature distribution that decreased ra\ndially outward. The density of the nebula was probably not very great. Model\nestimates of typical pressures in the vicinity of Earth's orbit generally fall in\nthe range of 10-100 Pa but these are not very well constrained. The disk must\nhave cooled primarily by radiation, condensing out dust particles that were\ninitially of composed of refractory elements. These high temperature conden\n\n1.4. PLANETARY FORMATION\nsates first appear at temperatures of 1600* - 1750*K and consist of silicates\noxides and titanates of calcium and aluminum, such as Al2O3, CaTiO3, and\nCa2Al2Si2O7 and refractory metals such as those in the platinum group. These\nminerals are found in white inclusions in the most primitive class of meteorites,\nthe Type III carbonaceous chondrites, discussed in a later lecture. Metallic\niron condenses out next, followed by the common silicate materials forsterite\n(an olivine) and enstatite (a pyroxene). Iron sulfide (troilite; FeS) and hydrous\nminerals condense at temperatures of 700*-800*K. Volatile materials, most no\ntably H2O and CO\ncondense out at 300*-400*K. Planets that contain these\nsubstances were accumulated from material that condensed in this temperature\nrange, which provides some clue about the early thermal structure of the solar\nnebula.\nTime scales for the condensation of gas to dust, of accumulation of dust to\nplanetesimals, and of accretion of planetesimals to planets and moons are also\nnot well constrained. If cooling occurred slowly in comparison to other processes\nthen planets would have formed during the cooling process and could have\naccreted inhomogeneously. If instead cooling occurred rapidly, then the planets\nwould have formed from cold, generally homogeneous material. Homogeneous\naccretion models are favored, with planetary differentiation thought to be mostly\naccomplished in the early stages after accretion.\nAccretion\nThe process or processes that were responsible for the accumulation of dust and\nsmall particles into planetesimals is a matter of debate. Sticking mechanisms\nsuch as electrostatic attraction and vacuum welding have been suggested. But\nas material accumulates, more planetesimal surface area is available for adding\nmore material so the process accelerates. When planetesimals reach sizes of\norder 102 km gravitational attraction begins to dominate and accretion becomes\ndominated by that force. In the planetesimal accretion stage collisional velocities\nare a key consideration. If relative velocities between planetesimals are too low,\nthen planetesimals will fall into nearly concentric orbits. Collisions will be low\nprobability events and planets will not grow. Whereas if relative velocities\nbetween planetesimals are too high, fragmentation rather than accumulation\nwill occur, and again planets won't grow. Safronov used scaling arguments\nconcerning energy dissipation during collisions and an assumed size distribution\nof planetesimals to suggest that the mutual gravitation causes relative velocities\nto be somewhat less than the escape velocities of the largest bodies. By his\nestimation the system should regulate itself in a way to favor the growth of\nlarge planetesimals. If this idea holds in a general sense, then solar systems\nshould form with a relatively small number of large planetary bodies rather\nthan with many small bodies. Monte Carlo simulations bear this idea out.\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\n1.5\nEarly Thermal State of the Earth\nAccretional Heating\nAs planetesimals accrete into moons and planets a significant amount of energy\nmust be released, much of which will be converted to heat. Various theories\nplace the time for the accretion of Earth from 105-108 years, which was very\nrapid indeed in comparison to the age of the solar system. If accretion occurred\nrapidly, then not much cooling could have occurred between collisions.\nTo determine the amount of heating associated with accretion, it is necessary\nto take an inventory of the various sources of energy in the system. These include\nthe kinetic energy of impacting projectiles, the potential energy of infalling\nmaterial to the planetary surface and the thermal energy. For simplicity we\nwill begin by assuming that accretion occurs sufficiently rapidly such that the\nprocess is adiabatic, i.e. with no heat lost from the accreting planet's surface.\nThe total energy per unit mass of accreted material is simply a sum of the\nchange in kinetic and potential contributions2:\n1 2\nGM\nCp∆T =\nvinf - vp +\n(1.7)\nR\nwhere ∆T is the temperature change, Cp is specific heat, vinf is the absolute\nvelocity of the approaching projectile, vp is the planetary velocity, (∆v)2 =\nvinf - vp is the relative impact velocity, G is the universal constant of gravitation,\nM is the mass of the planet, R is the planetary radius and\nGM = gR,\n(1.8)\nR\nwhere g is the gravitational acceleration at the planetary surface. It is reasonable\nto assume that the impact process is not perfectly efficient and that only a\nfraction h of the total energy will be converted to heat. Taking this into account\nand substituting ( .5) we may write\n1 2\nCp∆T = h\nvinf - vp + gR .\n(1.9)\nThis expression provides an upper limit of the increase in temperature that\ncould occur during accretion. In practice the potential energy term dominates\n(1.9). But this expression isn't very realistic because it doesn't allow for cooling.\nSo we next consider the additional complication that heat is lost from the\nsystem by cooling at the surface. It is possible to write a balance between the\ngravitational potential energy of accretion, the heat lost by radiation, and the\nthermal energy associated with heating of the body. This causes the problem\nto become time dependent:\nρGM (r) dr = εσ\n\nT 4(r) - Tb\ndt + ρCp [T (r) - Tb] dt\n(1.10)\nr\n2 Notice that this treatment does not follow the conventional definition of gravitational\npotential as used in later chapters, U = - GM .\nr\n\n1.5. EARLY THERMAL STATE OF THE EARTH\nwhere M(r) is the mass of the accumulating planet, ρ is the density of accreting\nmaterial, ε is emissivity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, Tb is the radiation\nequilibrium (blackbody) temperature, and t is time. In reality there will also be\nenergy associated with latent heats of melting and vaporization that are ignored\nhere. Temperature increases associated with the accretion of the the terrestrial\nplanets from numerical solutions to (1.10) require rapid accretion times, 103\nto 104 years for Earth, to exceed the melting temperature. These time scales\nare less than suggested by accretion models and would suggest that accretional\nheating is not very important for Earth or the other terrestrial planets. But\nit is necessary to consider in the most realistic sense possible the importance\nof radiation in ridding the planet of heat. Radiative temperature loss goes\nas T 4 and so is highly efficient in the sense that the planetary surface cools\nquickly. But if an impact site becomes buried by ejecta from fall-back or from\nnearby impacts, the surface would be covered. In this situation the outer part\nof the planet is hotter than the interior and thermal convection is prohibited.\nThe only way to rid the planet of heat is to conduct it to the surface where\nit can be radiated away. Conduction is a much less efficient heat transport\nprocess and so accretional heat would be retained longer if that mechanism\ndominated. If accretional energy is buried deeply enough to prohibit thermal\nradiation from the surface, then temperature increases of order 2000* can be\nattained for planets that accrete in times suggested by models (106-107 years).\nBut even if accretion did cause the near surface of the Earth to melt the process\ndoes not explain the earliest heating of the Earth's deep interior, which occurred\nthrough the process of differentiation.\nDifferentiation\nFrom the Earth's moment of inertia (C/MR2), which will be discussed later,\nwe know that the Earth (and other terrestrial planets) have a radially stratified\ninternal density structure. The implied increases in density with depth are\ngreater than would be associated with simple self-compression due to an increase\nof pressure with depth. This leaves compositional changes, and to a lesser extent\nphase changes, to explain the observations. If the Earth accreted cold, then\nthere must have been a process of internal differentiation to produce its radially\nstratified density structure. Differentiation from a homogeneous initial state to\na structure with a distinct core and mantle involves a change in gravitational\npotential energy. The release of this energy was likely to have been an important\nsource of heat in some planetary bodies. It is believed that differentiation would\nhave occurred early in planetary evolution after a period of radioactive heating\nor in the last stages of impact accretion in which the temperature required\nto melt iron is achieved at shallow depth. Molten iron separates out from its\nsilicate matrix and is denser than its surroundings and sinks by gravitational\nsettling. It is reasonable to assume that the separation and sinking time is short\ncompared to the time of heating. Also, the process is taking place in the interior\nso to first order surface heat loss may be neglected.\nUnder these assumptions it is possible to estimate the increase in temper\n\nCHAPTER 1.

We may calculate the change in gravi\ntational potential energy associated with the instantaneous differentiation of a\nplanet from a homogeneous state to a final state with a core and mantle. We\nshall assume that the total mass in the system remains constant. In addition,\nwe will neglect contributions from other effects such as phase changes, the latent\nheat of melting, rotational kinetic energy (due to the change in moment of in\nertia), and strain energy. The gravitational potential energy (Ω) for a spherical\nplanet in hydrostatic equilibrium in which density is simply a function of radius\nmay be written\nM Gm\nΩ=\ndm\n(1.11)\nr\nwhere m = 4/3πr3ρ is the mass of accreting spherical body, and dm = 4πr2ρdr.\nSubstituting (1.8) we find\nM\nΩ=\ng(r)rdm.\n(1.12)\nWe then re-arrange once again to integrate over the radius so that\nR\nΩ= 4π\ng(r)ρ(r)r 3 dr.\n(1.13)\nIn practice ρ = ρ(r) is determined from an empirically-derived equation of\nstate that relates density to pressure (i.e. depth).

Note\nthat for the Earth the increase in temperature is expected to have been great\nenough to have produced extensive melting. So shortly after accretion the Earth\n\n1.5. EARLY THERMAL STATE OF THE EARTH\nwould have been largely molten and vigorously convecting in the interior as a\nconsequence of differentiation. For Venus the size of the core isn't known but if\nit is similar to Earth (given that planet's similar radius and mass), then Venus\nalso would have experienced significant early melting when it formed its core.\nMelting also probably occurred on Mercury. But for Mars and the Moon the\ntemperature increase is not great enough for melt generation, even taking into\naccount the considerable uncertainties in core radii. Core formation could not\nhave been a significant heat source early in the evolution of these bodies.\nFormation of the Moon\nWe discussed above the role of impacts in the Earth's early heat budget from\nthe illustrative calculation of temperature increase due to accretional heating.\nBut after accretion there will continue to be impact infall as the planets \"sweep\nup\" asteroidal debris. This is quite apparent from looking at the 4.6 BY-old\nlunar highlands, which are saturated with impact craters formed during the\nterminal bombardment. It is now thought that a massive post-accretional\nimpact was responsible for the formation of the Moon. The origin of the Moon\nhas been a long-debated topic. While moons around planets are common in the\nsolar system, Earth's moon is somewhat unusual given its large size compared\nto the primary. One might wonder then, whether \"special circumstances\" were\nassociated with lunar origin.\nTraditional models for lunar formation included co-accretion (the Moon\nformed near the Earth), capture (the Moon strayed too near to Earth and\nbecame trapped in orbit), and fission (the Moon formed by spinning off the\nEarth during an early rapid rotational period). All of these models had serious\nproblems in explaining important features like the Moon's bulk composition,\nthe angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system, etc.\nThe theory that is currently is favored is the giant impact hypothesis,\nwhich has gained support from numerical simulations and is consistent with the\nfeatures above. In this scenario, shortly after accretion the Earth received a\nglancing impact from a Mars-sized asteroidal body. Smoothed particle hydro\ndynamic simulations from independent groups at Harvard and the University of\nArizona have the same general features: The mantles of both the early Earth\nand the impactor melted and vaporized and the core of the impacting body\nwrapped around Earth's core. Mantle material from Earth and the projectile\nthat was ejected re-condensed in orbit to form the Moon. This hypothesis is\nable to explain the puzzling lack of iron in the Moon. If this event did indeed\noccur then the Earth would have been largely melted by the event. Such a catas\ntrophic occurrence must factor in to scenarios for the post-accretional evolution\nof the Earth.\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\n1.6\nRadioactive Decay\nRadioactivity was discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1896 and it ultimately had\nprofound implications for the evolution of the Earth. By that time sedimentary\nlayering in outcrops was somewhat understood, at least to the point where\nit was known that observed sedimentary strata must have taken hundreds of\nmillions of years to accumulate. At that point the only known energy sources\navailable to the sun and Earth, i.e. the energy associated with gravitational\ncollapse, allowed a maximum age of 25 Ma. For about 3 decades geologists\ndebated whether to accept this age. The argument became moot due to the\ndiscovery of radioactivity. From the point of view of the evolution of the Earth,\nthe discovery of radioactivity had two effects:\n(1) it removed the short-term age limit of the Earth by providing a mecha\nnism for long-term heating (here we are referring to the internal heat that drives\nmantle convection and thus plate motions); and\n(2) it provided a means of determining absolute dates for rocks.\nThe stability of elements with respect to decay is related to the relative\nnumbers of protons and neutrons. If the numbers of these are not approximately\nequal then material is prone to decay. Elements with the same number of protons\nbut a different number of neutrons are called isotopes.\nRadioactive decay occurs because some of the mass of an atom is held in\nbinding energy. If there is \"too much\" binding energy (and quantum mechanics\nis required to assess what exactly constitutes \"too much\") then the nucleus will\ndecay spontaneously to lower the energy state. Induced nuclear reactions, say\nby bombarding large atoms with neutrons, may also be used to achieve the lower\nenergy state. Radioactive decay can occur by three classes of mechanisms:\nalpha decay - the escape of a helium nucleus,\nbeta decay - the escape of an electron or positron, or\ngamma decay - the emission of gamma radiation.\nRadioactive decay is described with a simple rate law. The change in the\ntotal number N of radioactive particles over the time interval dt is therefore:\ndN = -λ N,\n(1.15)\ndt\nwhere the minus sign indicates that activity decreases with time, and λN repre\nsents the average number of particles that decay per second. The constant λ is\nbased on the probability of a particular decay mechanism operating in an atom\nof a given element. We may rewrite\ndN = -λ dt,\n(1.16)\nN\nand integrating both sides of (1.16) we find\nln N = -λt + c,\n(1.17)\n\n1.6. RADIOACTIVE DECAY\nwhere the constant c is found in the limit where t → 0 to be ln No. Taking the\nexponential of both sides we may write\nN(t) = No e -λt ,\n(1.18)\nwhere No is the initial number of radioactive particles. Equation 1.18 is the rate\nlaw of radioactive decay. The half-life, T1/2, which represents the time it takes\nfor half of the number of particles to decay, is found by setting N/No = 1/2\nsuch that\nN\nln 2\n0.69315\n=\n= e -λT1/2\n⇒\nT1/2 =\n=\n.\n(1.19)\nNo\nλ\nλ\nNote that the half-life represents an alternative way of expressing the decay\nconstant λ. Nuclear binding energies are very large and nuclei are so small that\nradioactive decay rates are not significantly affected by physical conditions on\nEarth such as pressure and temperature. However, half-lives can be changed\nslightly by changes in bonding energy. For example, solar wind studies have\nshown that radioactive beryllium decays at slightly different rates on the sun\nand Earth.\nIn principle, the experimentally-demonstrated accuracy of the simple expres\nsion (1.19) allows for the determination of the absolute ages of billion-year-old\nrocks. However, in practice the initial concentration of the radioactive parent\nelement No is very often not known. We can more easily measure the concen\n∗\ntration of the daughter product (D ), which is simply\n∗\nD = No - N .\n(1.20)\nWe may substitute (1.18) for N to find\nD ∗ = No - Noe -λt = No\n\n1 - e -λt .\n(1.21)\nWe want to eliminate No so we divide by (1.18) which gives\nD∗\nNo 1 - e-λt\n1 - e-λt\n=\n=\n.\n(1.22)\nNo e-λt\ne-λt\nN\nor\n∗\nD\n= e λt - 1.\n(1.23)\nN\nEquation (1.23) can be used directly in the determination of ages if there is\nno initial non-radiogenic daughter component, or if that initial component can\nbe estimated.\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\n1.7\nRadiometric Dating\nThe Rubidium-Strontium System\nTo illustrate the radiometric dating technique, consider the decay of the unstable\nisotope of rubidium, 87Rb, into the stable isotope of strontium, 87Sr. This\nsystem is particularly simple because the parent element only decays into one\ntype of daughter element, unlike 40K, say, which decays into both 40Ar and 40Ca\n. The Rb-Sr system is useful for dating old rocks because the decay constant λ\nand half-life T1/2 for the Rb-Sr system are well suited for the purpose:\n-1\nλ = 1.42 × 10-11 yr\n,\nT1/2 = 48.8 × 109 yr .\n(1.24)\nOnly a fraction of the rubidium that was present in the solar nebula has so far\ndecayed. If t is the time since some melting event reset the isotope ratios to\ntheir high-temperature values, then by (1.18), the current amount of 87Rb is\nreduced from its initial amount 87Rb0 by:\n-λ87 t\n87Rb = 87 Rb0 e\n.\n(1.25)\nThe current amount of strontium, 87Sr, is therefore increased from its initial\namount, 87Sr0, by:\n87Sr\n=87 Sr0 +87 Rb0 -87 Rb\n(1.26)\n=87 Sr0 +87 Rb(eλ87 t - 1) .\n(1.27)\nTo proceed with the dating, one uses a mass spectrometer to measure the\namounts of 87Sr and 87Rb present in each sample. Since different parts of a rock\nwill contain different concentrations of the unknown quantity 87Sr0, we must\nnormalize against another stable isotope with similar chemistry that occurs in\nproportional concentrations, like 86Sr. Dividing (1.9) by 86Sr yields:\n87Sr\n87Sr\n87Rb\n=\n+\n(e λ87 t - 1) .\n(1.28)\n86Sr\n86Sr\n86Sr\nThe presence of initial daughter abundances also requires more than one\nmeasurement of the parent/daughter ratio to obtain an age. Samples that have\ndifferent 87Rb/86Sr ratios can be plotted versus 87Sr/86Sr using (1.10). The\n87Rb/86Sr ratio varies naturally from one mineral to another. For example it is\ntypically higher in plagioclase than in pyroxene, so a spread in the samples is\nobtained by mineral separation. When plotted, the two ratios fall on a straight\nline called an isochron (meaning \"equal time\"), which by 1.28 has a slope of\n(eλt - 1) ≈ λt and a y-intercept of (87Sr/86Sr)0. If the decay constant λ of the\nradioactive parent is known, the isochron yields the age, t, of the rock.\nThe most useful decay systems for radiometric dating are Rubidium-Strontium\n(Rb-Sr), Samarium-Neodymium (Sm-Nd), Potassium-Argon (K-Ar), Thorium-\nLead (Th-Pb), and the two Uran-ium-Lead (U-Pb) systems. As illustrated\n\n1.7. RADIOMETRIC DATING\nabove, in order for a parent-daughter system to be useful, a non-radiogenic ref\nerence isotope of the daughter must be present for comparison. In addition,\nthe decay constant of the parent must be accurately known. The accuracy of\nradiometric dating also depends on the extent to which the rock under study\nhas been a chemically closed system with respect to the parent and daughter\nelements. If it has not been a closed system then the daughter/parent ratio\nwill not be solely due to radioactive decay, and the time information will be\ncorrupted.\nThe Uranium-Lead System\nThe U-Pb system is especially useful because only measurements of Pb are\nrequired, and Pb tends to be reliable because it is not too mobile in rock. Also,\nbecause of decades of nuclear research the decay constants for uranium are very\naccurately known. Zircon crystals are resistant to uranium diffusion and are\ncommonly used for this dating scheme. There are four isotopes of Pb: 204Pb,\n208Pb\n206Pb, 207Pb,\n. Only 204Pb does not have a radioactive progenitor, and\nthe decay schemes for the other three isotopes are:\n238U → 206 Pb ,\nλ238\n= 1.55 × 10-10 yr-1 ,\nT1/2 = 4.5 By\n(1.29)\n235U → 207 Pb ,\nλ235\n= 9.85 × 10-10 yr-1 ,\nT1/2 = 0.7 By\n(1.30)\n232Th → 208 Pb ,\nλ232\n= 4.95 × 10-11 yr-1 ,\nT1/2 = 14 By .\n(1.31)\nUsing (1.8) and referencing to the non-radiogenic 204Pb we find\n206Pb\n206Pb\n238U\n=\n+\ne λ238 t - 1\n\n,\n(1.32)\n204Pb\n204Pb\n204Pb\n207Pb\n207Pb\n235U\n=\n+\ne λ235 t - 1\n\n.\n(1.33)\n204Pb\n204Pb\n204Pb\nNow take the ratio of 207Pb/204Pb to 206Pb/204Pb:\n207Pb\n207Pb\n-\n204Pb\n204Pb\n235U eλ235 t - 1\n206Pb\n206Pb = 238U eλ238 t - 1 ,\n(1.34)\n-\n204Pb\n204Pb\nand rewrite into an isochron equation:\n207Pb\n206Pb\n= M\n+ B ,\n(1.35)\n204Pb\n204Pb\nwhere the slope and y-intercept are:\n235U\n207Pb\n206Pb\neλ235 t - 1\nM =\n= 0.613 ,\nB =\n-M\n= 4.46 .(1.36)\n238U\n204Pb\n204Pb\neλ238 t - 1\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nThe age information is contained in the slope, M , using only isotopes of Pb.\nThe value of 235U/238U is 1/137.88, and this ratio is very nearly constant in\nall natural materials. To determine the initial lead ratios the standard practice\nis to look to meteorites. Iron meteorites have virtually no uranium. The least\nradiogenic lead found anywhere is in the Canyon Diablo meteorite. This is\ndefined to be primordial lead, the initial lead ratio in the solar nebula.\nThe Age of Earth\nUsing the decay constants for uranium, the 235U/238U ratio given above, and\nthe initial lead ratios from Canyon Diablo this gives a date of (4.54 ± 0.03) × 109\nyears. This is the time when isotopically homogeneous lead was isolated from\nthe solar nebula in various bodies with different U/Pb ratios. This is the best\nestimate the age of the Earth. It is interesting that Earth and the meteorites\nfall on the same lead-lead isochron, which is evidence that lead and uranium\nwere both isotopically homogeneous in the solar nebula before the accretion into\nthe planets.\nThe radiometric dating of crustal and oceanic rocks from Earth's surface\nindicates that most of the surface is less than 100 million years old. The oldest\nrock was dated by Sam Bowring of MIT. It is an igneous rock and the age is\n4.03 × 109 years. The surface of Earth is much younger than that of the other\nsolid planets for several reasons.\nErosion is efficient on Earth because of the abundance of liquid water and\nbecause of the presence of a biosphere. Earth also renews its surface continu\nously through the action of plate tectonics, where new crustal material comes\nto the surface at mid-ocean ridges and old crustal material plunges below the\nsurface at subduction zones. Given the great activity occurring on Earth's sur\nface, it is not at all surprising that terrestrial rocks are not the oldest rocks in\nthe solar system.\n1.8\nRadioactivity as a Heat Source\nRadioactivity is an important source of heating in the early solar system and\nin addition represents the major source of long-term heating of the Earth (and\nother terrestrial planets). The important heat-producing radionuclides form two\nclasses: long-lived nuclides and short-lived nuclides.\nLong-Lived Nuclides\nThe long-lived radionuclides, of which the most important are 238U, 235U,\n232Th and 40K, are a primary source of heat over the span of Earth history. They\nprovide heat which drives present-day mantle convection. Long-lived radioactive\nelements have combinations of valence states and ionic radius that prevent them\nfrom being easily accommodated into the crystal lattices of the most common\nsilicate rocks. They are examples of lithophile elements, which preferentially\n\n1.9. METEORITES AND THE BULK COMPOSITION OF THE EARTH 17\nconcentrate in the liquid phase; the majority of them are incorporated into the\nfirst few percent of a melt. For this reason, a significant fraction of the Earth's\nradioactivity is concentrated in the continental crust.\nShort-Lived Nuclides\nThe short-lived radionuclides may have been an important source of heat\nresponsible for the early melting of meteorites. They might also have provided\nan early heat source for planets, depending on the time between nucleosynthesis\nand planetary accretion. The most abundant of the short-lived radionuclides\nis 26Al, which decays with a half-life of 720,000 years to 26Mg. The evidence\nfor 26Al being an important source of heat in the early history of the solar\nsystem comes from excess amounts of 24Mg found in CAI's in the Allende me\nteorite. The isotope 26Mg was enriched relative to the most common isotope\n24Mg compared to solar abundance. The heat-producing ability of this isotope\nis such that solid objects a few km or greater would have been heated to melt\ning if they formed with the ratio of 26Al/27Al implied to have been present in\nAllende.\nA major question is: how could 26Al be incorporated fast enough into early\nsolar system objects to melt them? With such a short half-life, radioactive decay\nbegins to produce heat after a cosmically short period of time. The isotope 26Mg\nis only produced by decay of 26Al, and 26Al is only produced in supernovae.\nThis suggests that our solar system might have formed close to a supernova.\nAnother piece of information in support of the supernova hypothesis is the fact\nthat very small diamonds have been found in some meteorites. On Earth dia\nmond forms at great depths due to very high pressures which contract carbon to\nthe closely-packed state, characterized by all covalent bonds. In space the pres\nsures required to form diamond can only be achieved in a supernova. If the solar\nsystem formed near a supernova it would solve the problem of the mechanism\nthat caused the protosolar cloud to collapse, as the shock waves that emanate\nfrom supernovae would provide a natural mechanism for compression. However,\nsupernovae are rare events and if it is necessary to invoke the participation of\none it would imply that the formation of our solar system was a chance event.\n1.9\nMeteorites and the Bulk Composition of the\nEarth\nThe chemical and mineralogical information contained in the various types of\nmeteorites yield some of our most important clues about the nature of the\nearly solar system and the early Earth. A wide range of information about\nthe chemical and physical state derives from analysis of the various classes of\nmeteorites. We review the various types of meteorites and their implications for\nthe Earth's bulk composition.\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\n1.10\nChondrites\nChondrites form the most abundant class of meteorites and as a group represent\nprimordial objects that are chemically similar to the sun. They are so named be\ncause they contain chondrules3, which are primitive, glassy, silicate globules\nup to a few millimeters in size. Chondrules were magnetized as independent\ngrains, and have never been found in a terrestrial rock. It is believed that the\nchondrules condensed out of the protoplanetary nebula before being incorpo\nrated into a matrix that consists of crystalline silicate minerals and sometimes\ngrains or filaments of iron-nickel alloy. The magnetization, spherical shape and\nfine crystalline structure indicate that they were melted and very rapidly cooled,\nperhaps on time scales as short as minutes. Chondrules have been preserved\nbecause they were incorporated into parent bodies that were not large enough\nto undergo dynamic processes that would modify or destroy them.\nA comparison of elemental abundance in a chondrite versus elemental abun\ndance in the sun's photosphere, as determined by spectroscopy, yields an as\ntonishing correspondence. The only elements that don't match well are the\nmost volatile elements, which tend to escape incorporation into a meteorite as\nit cools, and lithium, which is depleted in the sun due to nuclear reactions.\nThe name chondrite has come to refer more broadly to any meteorite with a\nchemical composition that is similar to that of the sun, and there are a num\nber of subclasses, defined on the basis of their chemistry and their degree of\nmetamorphism, i.e., the modification of their structure and mineralogy due to\ntemperature and pressure.\nCarbonaceous Chondrites\nAn important fall occurred in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1969, when a large me\nteor was observed to come into the atmosphere many pieces. The first piece\nwas found near a house in the small village of Pueblito de Allende. Follow\ning standard practice, all of the meteorite fragments that were recovered from\nthat fall are collectively named Allende. The Allende fall occurred just as the\nApollo program was swinging into full gear, and it gave scientists who were\npreparing for the arrival of moon rocks an opportunity to practice techniques\nfor analysis of chemical composition on an extraterrestrial sample. Because of\nits unique chemical constitution and the fact that there was plenty of it to go\naround, analysis of the Allende meteorite has taught us much about the early\nsolar system.\nAllende is a member of an important sub-class of chondrites referred to as\nthe carbonaceous chondrites. It is a Class III carbonaceous chondrite that\nis the most primitive (i.e. least altered by heating or other metamorphism) of\nthat class and much of what we know about the bulk composition of the Earth\nis based on that single meteorite.\n3 From the Greek word χoνδρoς or chondros, meaning \"grain\"\n\n1.11. SECONDARY PROCESSING\n1.11\nSecondary Processing\nIf we want to use chondrites and other meteorites as a probe of the early so\nlar system, we need to have a good idea of the types of processes that mod\nified these meteorites from their original forms. Igneous meteorites, like the\nhowardite-eucrite-diogenite suite (HED), have definitely experienced sec\nondary processing. However, they do provide unique information about the\nevolution of Earth and terrestrial planets, particularly basalt generation and\ncore formation. Chondrites may be the least altered class of meteorites, but\nthey too have undergone secondary processing. Most chondrites have experi\nenced thermal metamorphism. The result is changes in texture and mineral\nogy, and possibly chemical composition. The temperatures necessary to cause\nmetamorphism are in the 400* to 1000*C range for the relatively low pressures\nencountered in small parent bodies. Possibly important heat sources are the\ndecay of short-lived radionuclides, electromagnetic induction, and accretion of\nmaterial. The least metamorphosed type III chondrites (like Allende) probably\ncarry the most information about the early solar system, but even these have\nbeen effected somewhat by secondary thermal processing. Along with heat, the\nchemical reactivity of water has played an important role in the secondary pro\ncessing of some of the most compositionally primitive meteorites. This process,\ncalled aqueous alteration, tends to replace the preaccretionary lithology with\nnew mineralizations, although the bulk chemistry is apparently preserved.\nAlong with internal processing, meteorites can be changed by exogenic pro\ncesses like collisions. Violent impacts produce shock metamorphism of individ\nual mineral grains, and also produce rocks called breccias that contain mixtures\nof different previous rocks, just like the breccias found on the lunar highlands.\nThe study of breccias has provided information on the accretional growth and\nprocessing of parent bodies. The effects of shock metamorphism have been seen\nin all major groups of meteorites. It appears that collision-induced high speed\nimpacts took place before, during, and after the initial accretion and differenti\nation of the parent bodies.\nMeteorites contain information related to their long exposures to galactic\ncosmic rays, solar radiation and the solar wind. It is possible to determine\nhow long a meteorite existed free of its parent body before it impacted Earth by\nexamining the cosmic ray damage. Noble gases are the most volatile elements in\nmeteorites, but they are nonetheless present in measurable quantities in virtually\nall meteorites. Trapped noble gases are either \"solar\" or \"planetary.\" The\nsolar noble gases are actually implanted solar-wind or solar-flare material, and\nprovide relatively direct information about the sun. The planetary noble gases\nhave elemental abundances similar to those found in Earth's atmosphere.\n1.12\nAchondrites\nThe achondrites are igneous meteorites that lack water-bearing (hydrous) or\noxidized minerals. This class of meteorites includes the eucrites, diogenites\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nand howardites. Because they are basaltic in composition they are believed to\ncome from parent bodies that were large enough to have differentiated (melted)\nto produce a crust. The main belt asteroid Vesta is the best compositional\nanalog for the eucrites.\nMeteorites from Mars\nShergottites are named after a meteorite that fell in 1865 in Shergotty, which\nis located in the northeastern Indian state of Bihar, which borders Nepal. Unlike\nthe eucrites, their pyroxene and plagioclase mineralogy is strikingly similar to\nterrestrial basalts. They also have small amounts of the hydrous mineral amphi\nbole kaersutite, whereas eucrites show no evidence of water in their minerals, and\nthey have some magnetite, which contains iron in oxidized form (Fe+3), whereas\neucrites contain only reduced iron. Their pyroxene crystals are elongated and\narranged horizontally the way such crystals would accumulate after settling to\nthe bottom of a magma chamber. Such igneous rocks are called cumulates.\nTwo other types of cumulate meteorites have hydrous and oxidized minerals like\nthe shergottites, these are the nakhlites, which contain the dark-green to black\npyroxene mineral augite, and a unique meteorite that fell in Chassigny, France\ncalled chassignite, which contains mostly olivine. Together these three types\nof meteorites are referred to as the SNC (pronounced \"snick\") meteorites. The\nparent body for the SNC meteorites is conjectured to be Mars.\nMeteorites from the Moon\nSome meteorites have breccias with white clasts in darker matrix, like lunar\nrocks. These lunar origin of some meteorites was established without con\ntention because we have many lunar samples which provided close geochemical\nand petrological matches to the meteorite samples. The identification of lunar\nmeteorites opened the door to dynamical studies that subsequently established\nthe possibility that meteorites can viably be deposited at Earth from Mars.\nUreilites\nThese meteorites contain olivine and pigeonite, and the matrix contains graphite\nor diamond. The carbon content suggests a link with carbonaceous chondrites.\n1.13\nIrons and Stony-Irons\nIron and stony iron meteorites make up several percent of the meteorite popu\nlation. They constitute 4% of the meteorites that fall to Earth but are the most\ncommon find since they look so much different than the Earth's crustal rocks.\nStony iron meteorites consist of roughly equal parts of rock and iron, with\nthe rock component consisting of olivine, the most common mantle material,\nand minor amounts of other silicate phases. Stony irons make up only about\n1% of meteorites that fall to Earth.\n\n1.13. IRONS AND STONY-IRONS\nThe metallic component of these meteorites is predominantly iron with nickel\nin solid solution averaging usually about 10% but sometimes up to 20%. There\nare also smaller amounts of sulfide, graphite and occasionally silicate inclusions.\nWithin the iron there are two metal phases: the body-centered cubic (α) form\nkamacite (5.5% nickel) and the face-centered cubic (γ) taenite (variable, but\nusually > 27% nickel)\nThese phases occur because iron and nickel form a solid solution when mixed\nand are not completely miscible as they begin to cool. The iron and nickel are\nstructurally similar but not identical. At high temperatures they exchange\nfreely because the crystal lattice is expanded. But when cooling sets in their\nslight differences produce lattices with slightly different structures. At a point\nthe total energy of the system is minimized by segregating the elements into 2\nseparate lattices: one rich in iron and the other poor. To minimize the mismatch\nwhere the lattices connect, newly formed lattices form in preferred orientations\ncalled exsolution lamellae.\nApproximately 75% of iron meteorites exhibit a crystal pattern called Wid\nmanstatten structure, which is the term used for these exsolution lamellae.\nThe pattern is observed by taking a meteorite that is cut and polished and\ndipping it in acid. Because this pattern forms when an iron-nickel alloy crystal\nlizes, it is an indication that some asteroids were at least partially melted after\nthey formed. In fact, the details of the pattern tell the cooling history of the\nmeteorite parent body from which it was derived. From the iron-nickel phase\ndiagram we can see the evolution of the relative amounts of iron and nickel\nthat crystallized as the iron cooled. And from the variations in composition\nacross Widmanstatten structure boundaries it is possible to constrain the rate\nof cooling.\nIron Meteorites and Planetary Cores\nIn the iron-nickel system, equilibrium is maintained at temperatures above\n650*C. Below 350*C crystal structures are frozen in. So the Widmanstat\nten structures yield the cooling rate in this temperature range. In the mete\norites wide diffusion boundaries correspond to slow cooling and narrow diffusion\nboundaries correspond to rapid cooling. In the meteorites there are iron-nickel\ncrystals that grown with lengths of up to several centimeters, which correspond\nto rates of 0.4 → 40*/Ma. So the Widmanstatten structures yield cooling rates\nof many millions of years. For a cooling periods in this range radii of meteorite\nparent bodies in the range 100-200 km are implied.\nIdentification of a significant metallic group within the meteorites made it\nthe natural presumed component of dense planetary cores. It is known from\nthe masses of the planets that the interiors are (in most cases), after correcting\nfor the effect of self-compression, denser than rock. An iron-nickel alloy with\napproximate meteoritic proportions is the leading candidate for the dense com\nponent. Shock wave experiments indicate that seismic wave velocities in the\nEarth's deep interior are consistent with a predominantly iron composition and\nthus support the contention.\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nTable 1.14: Mean densities and moments of inertia for the\nterrestrial planets\n-3)\nPlanet\nBulk Density (kg m\nC/MR\nMercury\n??\nVenus\n0.34 (inferred)\nEarth\n0.3335\nMoon\n0.391\nMars\n0.366\nThe other piece of evidence for iron planetary cores comes from the process\nof nucleosynthesis. Iron has the highest binding energy for nucleon and is thus\nhighly stable and produced in abundance in stellar evolution. The equilibrium\nprocess (aka e-process) in stellar thermonuclear reactions breaks apart silicon\natoms and re-arranges them to convert silicon to heavier and more stable nuclei.\nThe most stable and thus most abundant element produced in the e-process is\niron.\n1.14\nThe Terrestrial Planets\nThe table below shows a comparison of the mean densities and moment of\ninertia factors (C/MR2) for the terrestrial planets. The mean densities are\n\"uncompressed\" so they correct for self-compression and represent zero-pressure\ndensities. The moment of inertia, which will be derived later in the semester, is\na measure of the the extent to which mass is concentrated toward the center of a\nbody with a value of 0.4 representing a uniform, homogeneous sphere and lesser\nvalues representing mass increasingly concentrated toward the center. This\nparameter reflects both self-compression and the presence of increasingly dense\nmaterial toward the center.\nNote that Venus and Earth are quite similar, consistent with their similarity\nin radius and mass. Mars has a lower bulk density and a higher moment of\ninertia core indicating less iron and a smaller core. Mercury is denser and while\nthe moment of inertia hasn't been measured, it is thought based on the mass\nthat its core is nearly 80% of the planet's radius. Mercury thus likely has a\nlarge iron core. The Moon has a bulk density similar to that of Earth's mantle\nand a moment of inertia just slightly less than that of a uniform sphere. The\nimplied upper limit of core size is 350 km (out of a radius of 1738 km). Thus\nthe Moon has very little iron in the interior.\n1.15\nOne-dimensional Earth's structure\nTo a large extent, the radial stratification as inferred from seismology and con\nstrained by astronomical and meteorite data represents the stable structure that\n\n1.15. ONE-DIMENSIONAL EARTH'S STRUCTURE\nresults from differentiation processes as discussed by Maria Zuber. In addition\nto using this structure for the introduction of some useful terminology this radial\nstructure serves as an important reference model for many geophysical inves\ntigations. The average properties are now fairly well known; it is fair to say\nthat the uncertainties in the average values are insignificant as compared to\nthe local and regional deviations from the reference value. Constraining and\nunderstanding the aspherical variations in physical properties is the objective\nof many geophysical studies. It involves the study of anomalies relative to a\nreference values (e.g., gravity and heat flow anomalies). The deviations from\nthe reference values contain information pertinent to geodynamical processes.\nRadial stratification of the Earth from seismic data\nThe essential data used to derive the depth variation of seismic wave speed in\nthese early days of seismology were the travel times of different types of seismic\nwaves. These can be determined from seismograms, which are records (analog\nor digital) of ground motion due to earthquakes or man-made explosions (e.g.,\nnuclear tests).\nSome history: Until late last century most research relevant to seismology\nwas in fact done by physicists and mathematicians who loved to study elas\ntic wave propagation (famous names that also contributed to seismology are\nNavier, Poisson, Gauss, Rayleigh). Therefore, most of the theory was al\nready available at around the time of birth of observational seismology (late\nlast century; installation of the first seismometers for systematic earthquake\nmonitoring).\nFollowing a rapid succession of discoveries in the early years of this century,\nthe major subdivision of the Earth in concentric shells was established about 60\nyears ago, in the mid- to late thirties, by the pioneering work of Jeffreys and\nBullen and by Gutenberg and Richter. The following dates give some idea\nabout the pace of developments:\n- 1892- First record of earthquake (Japan)\n- 1906- Oldham demonstrates existence of core from seismic data\n- 1909- Mohorovicic discovers seismic interface that marks the crust-mantle\nboundary (MOHO)\n- 1912- Gutenberg estimates depth to core mantle boundary\n- 1936- Lehman discovers existence of Inner Core\n- 1939- early knowledge summarized in first 1D Earth models, the famous\nJeffreys-Bullen tables (which are still surprisingly accurate)\n- 1948- Bullen uses wave speed information + estimates of Earth's moment\nof inertia to determine average density as a function of increasing depth.\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nAfter that, main focus on determining 3D structure. Mid seventies: pio\nneering work at MIT (K. Aki, M. N. Toks oz) and Harvard (A. Dziewonski)\nresults in first realistic 3D models of seismic propagation speed in Earth's\nmantle.\nHow does this work? Just a brief account will do here: modern seismometers\nmeasure the three spatial components of this ground motion over in a wide\nfrequency band and with a large dynamic range. What is important in these\nrecords is (1) the large variation in frequency (body waves and surface waves)\nand (2) the arrival of distinct seismic phases (such as P and S waves). For\nimaging purposes the difference in frequency controls the amount of detail that\ncan be investigated with certain seismic data (resolution) whereas the different\nphases sample different parts of the Earth's interior. What's important for now\nis how the travel times measured from such records can tell us something about\nEarth's radial structure.\nLet us assume for the time being that we know where and when an earth\nquake occurred (for instance from local damage reports). One can then construct\nso-called record sections, in which the seismograms are sorted according to the\ndistance of the station to the earthquake epicentre (location at the surface).\nThis distance (epicentral distance) is typically denoted by a ∆ [*]. If many\ndata are available one can determine best-fitting travel-time curves for different\nseismic phases. (Note: in practice we do not know the earthquake location and\norigin time (hypocentre) and the determination of source location and spatial\nvariations in wave speed are intimately connected, with some nasty trade-offs).\nThe variation of the travel time as a function of distance (T(∆) [s]) can\nbe used to construct models of the variation of wave speed with depth. Using\nsome simple physics one can also show that the knowledge of the wavespeed as\nfunction of depth (in combination with constraints such as the average density\nand the moment of inertia (I 0.33 MR2 for the Earth) can be used to deduce\nthe radial variation in density. The relevant equation, the Adams-Williamson\nequation, is valid in regions where density is controlled by adiabatic compression\nand will be derived later.\nIn general, the wave speed increases with increasing depth in the mantle due\nto the effect of increasing pressure on the bulk modulus (κ) and rigidity (μ).\n(Note: P wave speed α =\nκ + 4\n3μ/ρ; S wave speed β =\nμ/ρ).\nAn abrupt increase in both P and S wave speed occurs at a depth of about\n10-40 km. This seismic discontinuity marks the crust-mantle interface and was\ndiscovered by Mohorovicic (hence \"Moho\" discontinuity). The definition (and\nthus the mapping) of the seismological Moho is primarily based on seismic wave\nspeeds and does not necessarily coincide with a petrologic moho (See Anderson,\n1988, for discussion). This leads to a subdivision in terms of crust-mantle-core;\nthe subdivision in terms of crust-lithosphere-asthenosphere-mantle is based on\nthermal or mechanical properties. The latter nomenclature is, unfortunately,\nnot unique and different scientists may mean different things, so beware!)\nBetween about 400 and 1000 km in depth the increase in wave speeds is larger\nthan expected from adiabatic compression. This observation (first by Birch,\n\n1.15. ONE-DIMENSIONAL EARTH'S STRUCTURE\n1952) has major implications for mantle dynamics and will be discussed in more\ndetail later. The increase in now generally believed to be due to isochemical\nphase changes in the mantle silicates.\nIn the outer core, the P-wave speed decreases abruptly and this, in fact,\ncauses the \"shadow zone\" for P- waves that was used as one of the major argu\nments by Oldham (1906) and Gutenberg (1912) to infer from seismological data\nthe existence of a core and the depth to the core-mantle-boundary (CMB). The\ncore behaves as a fluid (pointed out by Jeffreys in 1926 on the basis of tidal data,\ni.e. later than the discovery of the CMB!) even on short time scales so that shear\nwaves cannot propagate through the (outer) core. The inner core (discovered\nby Inge Lehman (Denmark) in 1936) is solid; the seismological evidence for this\nwill be discussed later. (Question: temperature increases monotonically with\nincreasing depth, so why is there an alternation between depth intervals where\nrock is solid and where it behaves as a liquid?)\nComposition\nDespite centuries of geologic prospecting we have limited access to most parts of\nthe Earth. consequently our understanding of its bulk composition must come\nfrom inference based on remote observation as well as the record from meteorites\nand the solar atmosphere. The dominant non-volatile constitutents in the sun\nare silicon [Si], magnesium [Mg] and iron [Fe]. The meteorites similarly are\ndominated by these elements and their oxides.\nSome of the internal boundaries of the Earth represent phase changes that\nseparate regions of the same bulk composition, others coincide with a change\nin chemistry. Seismology helps but can often not uniquely determine variations\nin temperature, composition, or density. There are often several mineral as\nsemblages that have the same density or elastic properties. Using the cosmic\nabundance of elements and results of laboratory experiments at high pressures\nand temperatures with rock forming minerals and their analogs we have, how\never, arrived at the following broad picture of the average composition in each\nof the concentric shells:\n(Recall that the most abundant non-volatile elements in the solar system are\nmagnesium [Mg], iron [Fe], and silicon [Si].)\nThe crust, which is only 0.5% of the volume of the mantle, is rich in SiO2\nand Al2O3 (hence the old name SiAl) + CaO, Na2O.\nThe composition of the mantle is roughly given by the following series of\nsolid solutions, with primary constituents SiO2 and MgO (hence the old name\nSiMa; also MaFic, i.e. magnesium and iron (Fe) rich):\nImportant are the following two pairs:\n(Mgα, Fe1-α)O + SiO2\n→ (Mgα, Fe1-α)SiO3\n(orthopyroxene)\n2(Mgα, Fe1-α)O + SiO2\n→ (Mgα, Fe1-α)2SiO4\n(olivine)\nwith α = Mg/(Mg + Fe) approximately 0.9 (names used for olivine: α =\n1: forsterite; α = 0: fayalite). The magnesium number is defined as 100 ×\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nMg/(Mg + Fe) and is often used in discussions of mantle rheology (a typical\nvalue is 90). Another important upper mantle mineral is garnet, also a (Mg,Fe)\nsilicate. With increasing pressure in the mantle olivine transforms to spinel\n(same composition) and post-spinel. Pyroxene + garnet transform to perovskite\nin the lower mantle.\nThere is some debate whether the relative amount of iron increases in the\nlower mantle (perhaps with a small, 2%, increase in intrinsic density (i.e. in\naddition to the effect of adiabatic compression): such a small density contrast\nmay not be significant from a dynamic point of view) and there is a growing con\nsensus that the composition of the lower mantle is similar to that of the upper\nmantle and transition zone. However, due to the higher pressures the crystallo\ngraphic structure is different, more compact. The most important constituents\nin the lower mantle are:\n(Mg, Fe)O\n(Magnesio)w ustite\n(Mg, Fe)SiO3\n(Perovskite)\nThere is also some debate about the exact ratio of pyroxene to olivine. The\nsolar abundance would favor a Mg/Si ratio close to 1, which would predict a\npredominance of pyroxene, but the presence of Fe allows for more olivine and\nthe ratio that matters is the (Mg+Fe)/Si ratio. The thermodynamics of the\nphase transformations in the two silicate systems (olivine and pyroxene) are\nvery important for our understanding of mantle dynamics, in particular for the\nquestion as to whether material can flow across the transition zone into the\nlower mantle. Because of their importance for mantel dynamics, phase changes\nwill be discussed in more detail later in this course.\nThe major outstanding problems pertinent to the mantle include the scale\nof mantle convection, the effectiveness of mixing, and the survival of separate\nreservoirs of compositional heterogeneity as inferred from isotope data. We will\ncome back to these exciting topics towards the end of the course.\nThe core (32% of the mass of the Earth; how much of its volume?) largely\nconsist of iron. Fe is the only heavy element with large enough solar abundance\nto be a suitable candidate to form the heavy element required to explain the\nlarge density of the Earth's core. However, if the core would consist entirely\nof metallic iron, its density would be higher than required from the moment of\ninertia and the mean density of the Earth. There must, therefore, be a light\nalloying element. Several of the light elements that are abundant in the solar\nsystem are either too volatile or are insoluble with metallic iron. The most\nlikely candidate is oxygen (O) (which is insoluble with metallic iron at low\npressures and is thus not found in iron meteorites), although some would argue\nfor Sulfur (S) (which is found in iron meteorites), or Silicon (Si). (Stacey uses\n80% O + 20% S, but S does not seem to be required). This is still an area of\nactive research; because of the extreme physical conditions there are hardly any\nexperimental data → lot of theoretical (thermodynamics) studies of Equations\nOf State (EOS) (See Anderson, 1988, for an introduction).\n\n1.16. LATERAL HETEROGENEITY IN THE MANTLE\nThe inner core (IC) has a radius of about 1220 km the IC comprises less\nthan 1%(!) of the volume of the Earth, but it represents about 1.7% of the\nEarth's mass. Because of the small size of the IC, the uncertainty of its density\nis relatively large. But within the uncertainty, the IC may simply be a \"frozen\"\nversion of the OC, and thus heavier since the lighter elements are selectively\nrejected, with as major constituents Fe2O, FeNiO, pure Fe or a Fe-Ni alloy.\nSome compositional layering of the core is probable. (Anderson (1988) is a\ngood reference for core composition).\nBecause of the recent developments in understanding the structure of the\ninner core (anisotropy, net rotation relative to the Earth's mantle) and the\nimportance of the core for the Earth's magnetic field, the core will be discussed\nin detail during this course (including reading assignments). (Some outstanding\nproblems: what maintains the IC-OC boundary? OC-lower mantle boundary?\nWhat produces the energy to drive core convection that produces the magnetic\nfield? Is there convection in the solid IC?).\n1.16\nLateral heterogeneity in the mantle\nIntroduction\nThe outer core behaves as a liquid and its low viscosity cannot sustain lateral\nvariations in density and can thus be regarded as homogeneous for many prac\ntical purposes. The mantle, however, is probably heterogeneous at all length\nscales. To a large extent this heterogeneity can be attributed to convective\ncirculation in the mantle and the recycling of (oceanic) lithosphere. The most\nimportant dynamic processes will be discussed later. This heterogeneity causes\nobserved seismic data to differ from predictions from a simple radially stratified\nreference model. Later in this course I will show how certain imaging tech\nniques can be used to interpret these travel time residuals to map the aspherical\nstructure of the Earth's interior.\nPlate Tectonics forms an integral aspect of this convective system and a\nrelevant discussion of plate tectonics thus involves more than the essentially\nkinematic concepts that were outlined in the 1960-ies. Therefore, plate tecton\nics, and its relationship with mantle convection, will be discussed in the second\nhalf of this course. However, to facilitate communication it is useful to intro\nduce some jargon and define important concepts, processes, and their resulting\nstructures.\nPlate boundaries as belts of high seismic activity\nOnce travel time table are established from a redundant seismological data set\nthey can be used to locate earthquakes. The pattern of seismicity is now well\nestablished and defines the locations of the plate boundaries. Note that the\ndistribution of earthquakes within plate boundaries (or plate boundary zones)\nvaries, which gives important information about the deformation in certain re\n\nCHAPTER 1. THE EARTH IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\ngions. On the basis of seismic belts about 12 major plates have been recognized.\nImportant aspects of kinematic plate-tectonic theory are that (1) the deforma\ntion within the plates (intraplate) is neglected; all deformation is assumed to\ntake place between plates (interplate) (if need be plates are subdivided into\nsmaller units until this condition is met). In other words, plates act as stress\nguides, which is important for the understanding of the driving forces of plate\ntectonics; (2) once new oceanic lithosphere is created it forms part of a rigid\nplate; the plate may or may not contain continents; (3) in order to conserve the\ntotal area of the Earth's surface: the rate of lithosphere creation equals rate\nof lithosphere destruction. The seismograms also contain information about\nthe physical rupture mechanism of earthquakes and can thus be used in the\nclassification of different types of plate boundary.\ndivergent plate boundaries Associated with \"normal\" faults (plates move\naway from each other). Characteristic in Mid Ocean Ridge (MOR) sys\ntems; locations of sea floor spreading where new oceanic crust is being\ncreated rather passively by means of decompression melting. Such bound\naries are sometimes referred to as accreting margins but this is confusing\nsince an important mechanism of continental growth is by means of ac\ncretion of allochthonous terranes (accretionary wedges, accreted terranes)\nonto Precambrian shields, for instance the western cordillera in Canada\nand eastern Australia.\nconvergent plate boundaries Associated with \"reverse\" faults (plates move\ntowards each other). Sometimes referred to as destructive margins. Char\nacteristic in circum-Pacific belt. Often accompanied with mountain build\ning, subduction, deep seismicity, and arc volcanism. Diagnostic bathymet\nric feature: deep sea trenches.\ntranscurrent plate boundaries Associated with strike slip faults. Impor\ntant in particular in association with ocean floor spreading → transform\nfaults. There is a separate classification of transform faults based on\nwhether they connect ridges or trenches, but that's not so exciting. Most\ncommon are ridge-ridge transforms. These are locations of many earth\nquakes since slip rate is twice as fast as spreading rate!\nLithosphere, asthenosphere, subduction zones\nWe will use the term lithosphere4 for the mechanically strong outer shell of\nthe earth, which contains the crust and part of the mantle. It is a thermal\nboundary layer (TBL) through which heat is lost to the surface by conduction.\nThere is also a thermal definition, in which the base of the lithosphere coincides\nwith the 1300*C isotherm (up to 100 km deep for oceans; at least twice that\nmuch for some (parts of) continents), but the mechanically strong (elastic) part\nof the lithosphere that can transmit stresses and support surface loads (e.g.,\n4 λιθoς or lithos=stone [Greek]\n\n1.16. LATERAL HETEROGENEITY IN THE MANTLE\nsea mounts) on geologic time scales is about half the TBL thickness (coinciding\nwith the 650*C isotherm). The cooling of oceanic lithosphere (+ relationship\nbetween lithospheric thickness and heat flow with square root of its age since\nformation at the MOR) is one of the \"classical\" aspects of plate tectonics that\nwill be discussed in the course of this term. In contrast, deformation in the\nasthenosphere5 occurs more freely by means ductile creep on geologic time\nscales. The asthenosphere may \"lubricate\" but does not participate directly in\ntectonic motion, although it could accommodate some of the return flow. Heat\nloss in asthenosphere and deeper mantle is controlled by convection.\nAs oceanic lithosphere moves away from the MOR it will cool and thicken\nand become more dense due to thermal contraction. Eventually, it will become\ngravitationally unstable and can, in principle, sink into the Earth's interior at\nocean trenches (note: initiation of subduction is not trivial since even gravita\ntionally unstable parts of the lithosphere can be retained at the surface by the\nstrength of the lithosphere). We will use the term subduction zone rather\nloosely for the geographical region where plate convergence results in the de\nscent of one plate beneath the other, typically the more mafic (Mg+Fe rich)\noceanic beneath the more acid, granitic continental plate. The result of this\nprocess is a slab of subducted former oceanic lithosphere that sinks into\nthe mantle. The negative buoyancy of the downgoing slab is, in fact, one of the\nmost important forces of plate motion. The depth extent of slabs is still debated,\nbut that does not -- according to these definitions -- influence the meaning of\na subduction zone. In the upper mantle and transition zone the slabs can be\ndelineated by earthquakes (the so called Wadati-Benioff zones), the slab is said\nto be seismogenic down to about 670 km depth (the actual depth to the deepest\nearthquakes can be smaller depending on the thermal structure of the slab).\nThere is now convincing evidence to support the aseismic continuation of slabs\ninto the lower mantle.\n5 ασθενης or a-sthenes= not-strong [Greek]"

The concept\nof gravity is relatively simple, high-precision measurements of the gravity field\nare inexpensive and quick, and spatial variations in the gravitational acceleration\ngive important information about the dynamical state of Earth. However, the\nstudy of the gravity of Earth is not easy since many corrections have to be\nmade to isolate the small signal due to dynamic processes, and the underlying\ntheory -- although perhaps more elegant than, for instance, in seismology --\nis complex. With respect to determining the three-dimensional structure of the\nEarth's interior, an additional disadvantage of gravity, indeed, of any potential\nfield, over seismic imaging is that there is larger ambiguity in locating the source\nof gravitational anomalies, in particular in the radial direction.\nIn general the gravity signal has a complex origin: the acceleration due to\ngravity, denoted by g, (g in vector notation) is influenced by topography, as\npherical variation of density within the Earth, and the Earth's rotation. In\ngeophysics, our task is to measure, characterize, and interpret the gravity sig\nnal, and the reduction of gravity data is a very important aspect of this scientific\nfield. Gravity measurements are typically given with respect to a certain refer\nence, which can but does not have to be an equipotential surface. An important\nexample of an equipotential surface is the geoid (which itself represents devia\ntions from a reference spheroid).\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nThe Gravity Field\nThe law of gravitational attraction was formulated by Isaac Newton (1642-1727)\nand published in 1687, that is, about three generations after Galileo had deter\nmined the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration and Kepler had discovered\nhis empirical \"laws\" describing the orbits of planets. In fact, a strong argument\nfor the validity of Newton's laws of motion and gravity was that they could be\nused to derive Kepler's laws.\nFor our purposes, gravity can be defined as the force exerted on a mass m due\nto the combination of (1) the gravitational attraction of the Earth, with mass M\nor ME and (2) the rotation of the Earth. The latter has two components: the\ncentrifugal acceleration due to rotation with angular velocity ω and the existence\nof an equatorial bulge that results from the balance between self-gravitation and\nrotation.\nThe gravitational force between any two particles with (point) masses M\nat position r0 and m at position r separated by a distance r is an attraction\nalong a line joining the particles (see Figure 2.1):\nMm\nF = ∥F∥ = G r2 ,\n(2.1)\nor, in vector form:\nMm\nr\nF = -G ∥r - r0∥3 (r - r0) = -G\nMm ˆ′ .\n(2.2)\n∥r - r0∥2\nFigure 2.1: Vector diagram showing the geometry of the gravitational attraction.\nwhere ˆr′ is a unit vector in the direction of (r - r0). The minus sign accounts for\nthe fact that the force vector F points inward (i.e., towards M) whereas the unit\nvector ˆ′ points outward (away from M). In the following we will place M at\nr\nthe origin of our coordinate system and take r0 at O to simplify the equations\n(e.g., r - r0 = r and the unit vector ˆ\nr) (see Figure 2.2).\nr′ becomes ˆ\n3 kg-1\nG is the universal gravitational constant: G = 6.673 × 10-11 m\ns-2 (or N m2 kg-2), which has the same value for all pairs of particles. G must\nnot be confused with g, the gravitational acceleration, or force of a unit\n\n2.1. GLOBAL GRAVITY, POTENTIALS, FIGURE OF THE EARTH, GEOID33\nFigure 2.2: Simplified coordinate system.\nmass due to gravity, for which an expression can be obtained by using Newton's\nlaw of motion. If M is the mass of Earth:\nMm\nF\nM\nF = ma = mg = -G r2 ˆr ⇒ g = m = -G r2 ˆr\n(2.3)\nM\nand\ng = ∥g∥ = G r2 .\n(2.4)\nThe acceleration g is the length of a vector g and is by definition always\npositive: g > 0. We define the vector g as the gravity field and take, by\nconvention, g positive towards the center of the Earth, i.e., in the -r direction.\nThe gravitational acceleration g was first determined by Galileo; the magni\ntude of g varies over the surface of Earth but a useful ball-park figure is g= 9.8\nms-2 (or just 10 ms-2) (in S.I. -- Syst`eme International d'Unit es -- units). In\nhis honor, the unit often used in gravimetry is the Gal. 1 Gal = 1 cms-2 = 0.01\nms-2 ≈ 10-3g. Gravity anomalies are often expressed in milliGal, i.e., 10-6g or\nmicroGal, i.e., 10-9g. This precision can be achieved by modern gravimeters.\nAn alternative unit is the gravity unit, 1 gu = 0.1 mGal = 10-7g.\nWhen G was determined by Cavendish in 1778 (with the Cavendish torsion\nbalance) the mass of the Earth could be determined and it was found that the\nEarth's mean density, ρ ∼ 5, 500 kgm-3, is much larger than the density of rocks\nat the Earth's surface. This observations was one of the first strong indications\nthat density must increase substantially towards the center of the Earth. In\nthe decades following Cavendish' measurement, many measurements were done\nof g at different locations on Earth and the variation of g with latitude was\nsoon established. In these early days of \"geodesy\" one focused on planet wide\nstructure; in the mid to late 1800's scientists started to analyze deviations of\nthe reference values, i.e. local and regional gravity anomalies.\nGravitational potential\nBy virtue of its position in the gravity field g due to mass M, any mass m has\ngravitational potential energy. This energy can be regarded as the work\nW done on a mass m by the gravitational force due to M in moving m from\nrref to r where one often takes rref = inf. The gravitational potential U is\nthe potential energy in the field due to M per unit mass. In other words, it's\nthe work done by the gravitational force g per unit mass. (One can define U as\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\neither the positive or negative of the work done which translates in a change of\nsign. Beware!). The potential is a scalar field which is typically easier to handle\nthan a vector field. And, as we will see below, from the scalar potential we can\nreadily derive the vector field anyway.\n(The gravity field is a conservative field so just how the mass m is moved\nfrom rref to r is not relevant: the work done only depends on the initial and\nfinal position.) Following the definition for potential as is common in physics,\nwhich considers Earth as a potential well -- i.e. negative -- we get for U:\nr\nr GM\nr 1\nGM\nU =\ng · dr = -\nˆr · dr = GM\ndr = -\n(2.5)\nr2\ninf r2\nr\nrref\nrref\nNote that ˆ\nr and dr point in opposite directions.\nr · dr = -dr because ˆ\nFigure 2.3: By definition, the potential is zero at infinity and decreases towards\nthe mass.\nU represents the gravitational potential at a distance r from mass M . Notice\nthat it is assumed that U (inf) = 0 (see Figure 2.3).\nThe potential is the integration over space (either a line, a surface or a\nvolume) of the gravity field. Vice versa, the gravity field, the gravity force per\nunit mass, is the spatial derivative (gradient) of the potential.\nGM\n∂\nGM\n∂\ng = -\nˆr =\n= -\nU = -gradU ≡-∇U\n(2.6)\nr2\n∂r\nr\n∂r\n\n2.1. GLOBAL GRAVITY, POTENTIALS, FIGURE OF THE EARTH, GEOID35\nIntermezzo 2.1 The gradient of the gravitational poten\ntial\nWe may easily see this in a more general way by expressing dr (the incremental\ndistance along the line joining two point masses) into some set of coordinates,\nusing the properties of the dot product and the total derivative of U as follows\n(by our definition, moving in the same direction as g accumulates negative\npotential):\ndU\n=\ng · dr\n=\n-gxdx -gy dy -gz dz\n.\n(2.7)\nBy definition, the total derivative of U is given by:\n∂U\n∂U\n∂U\ndU ≡\ndx +\ndy +\ndz\n(2.8)\n∂x\n∂y\n∂z\nTherefore, the combination of Eq. 2.7 and Eq. 2.8 yields:\n∂U ∂U ∂U\ng = -\n,\n,\n= -grad U ≡-∇U\n(2.9)\n∂x\n∂y ∂z\nOne can now see that the fact that the gravitational potential is defined to be\nnegative means that when mass m approaches the Earth, its potential (energy)\ndecreases while its acceleration due to attraction the Earth's center increases.\nThe slope of the curve is the (positive) value of g, and the minus sign makes\nsure that the gradient U points in the direction of decreasing r, i.e. towards the\ncenter of mass. (The plus/minus convention is not unique. In the literature one\noften sees U = GM/r and g = ∇U .)\nSome general properties:\n- The gradient of a scalar field U is a vector that determines the rate and\ndirection of change in U . Let an equipotential surface S be the surface of\nconstant U and r1 and r2 be positions on that surface (i.e., with U1 = U2 =\nU ). Then, the component of g along S is given by (U2 - U1)/(r1 - r2) = 0.\nThus g = -∇U has no components along S : the field is perpendicular to\nthe equipotential surface. This is always the case, as derived in Intermezzo\n2.2.\n- Since fluids cannot sustain shear stress -- the shear modulus μ = 0, the\nforces acting on the fluid surface have to be perpendicular to this surface\nin steady state, since any component of a force along the surface of the\nfluid would result in flow until this component vanishes. The restoring\nforces are given by F = -m∇U as in Figure 2.4; a fluid surface assumes\nan equipotential surface.\n- For a spherically symmetric Earth the equipotential would be a sphere and\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nFigure 2.4: F = -m∇U provides the restoring force\nthat levels the sea surface along an equipotential sur\nface.\ng would point towards the center of the sphere. (Even in the presence of\naspherical structure and rotation this is a very good approximation of g.\nHowever, if the equipotential is an ellipsoid, g = -∇U does not point to\nr = 0; this lies at the origin of the definition of geographic and geocentric\nlatitudes.)\n- Using gravity potentials, one can easily prove that the gravitational ac\nceleration of a spherically symmetric mass distribution, at a point outside\nthe mass, is the same as the acceleration obtained by concentrating all\nmass at the center of the sphere, i.e., a point mass.\nThis seems trivial, but for the use of potential fields to study Earth's\nstructure it has several important implications:\n1. Within a spherically symmetric body, the potential, and thus the\ngravitational acceleration g is determined only by the mass between\nthe observation point at r and the center of mass. In spherical coor\ndinates:\nr\ng(r) = 4π G\nρ(r ′)r ′2 dr′\n(2.10)\nr2\nThis is important in the understanding of the variation of the gravity\nfield as a function of radius within the Earth;\n2. The gravitational potential by itself does not carry information about\nthe radial distribution of the mass. We will encounter this later when\nwe discuss more properties of potentials, the solutions of the Laplace\nand Poisson equations, and the problem of non-uniqueness in gravity\ninterpretations.\n3. if there are lateral variations in gravitational acceleration on the sur\nface of the sphere, i.e. if the equipotential is not a sphere there must\nbe aspherical structure (departure from spherical geometry; can be\nin the shape of the body as well as internal distribution of density\nanomalies).\n\n2.1. GLOBAL GRAVITY, POTENTIALS, FIGURE OF THE EARTH, GEOID37\nIntermezzo 2.2 Geometric interpretation of the gradi\nent\nLet C be a curve with parametric representation C(τ ), a vector function. Let\nU be a scalar function of multiple variables. The variation of U , confined to the\ncurve C, is given by:\nd\ndC(τ )\n[U (C(t))] = ∇U (C(t)) ·\n(2.11)\ndt\ndt\nd\nTherefore, if C is a curve of constant U , dt [U (C(τ ))] will be zero.\nNow let C(τ ) be a straight line in space:\nC(τ ) = p + at\n(2.12)\nthen, according to the chain rule (2.11), at t0 = 0:\nd\n\n[U (C(τ ))]\n= ∇U (p) · a\n(2.13)\ndt\nt=t0\nIt is useful to define the directional derivative of U in the direction of a at\npoint p as:\na\nDAU (p) = ∇U (p) ·\n(2.14)\n∥a∥\nFrom this relation we infer that the gradient vector ∇U (p) at p gives the\ndirection in which the change of U is maximum. Now let S be an equipotential\nsurface, i.e. the surface of constant U . Define a set of curves Ci (τ ) on this\nsurface S. Clearly,\nd\n\ndCi\n[U (Ci (τ ))]\n= ∇U (p) ·\n(t0 ) = 0\n(2.15)\ndt\nt=t0\ndt\nfor each of those curves. Since the Ci (τ ) lie completely on the surface S, the\ndCi (t0 ) will define a plane tangent to the surface S at point p. Therefore, the\ndt\ngradient vector ∇U is perpendicular to the surface S of constant U . Or: the\nfield is perpendicular to the equipotential surface.\nIn global gravity one aims to determine and explain deviations from the\nequipotential surfaces, or more precisely the difference (height) between equipo\ntential surfaces. This difference in height is related to the local g. In practice\none defines anomalies relative to reference surfaces. Important surfaces are:\nGeoid the actual equipotential surface that coincides with the average sea level\n(ignoring tides and other dynamical effects in oceans)\n(Reference) spheroid : empirical, longitude independent (i.e., zonal) shape\nof the sea level with a smooth variation in latitude that best fits the geoid\n(or the observed gravity data). This forms the basis of the international\ngravity formula that prescribes g as a function of latitude that forms the\nreference value for the reduction of gravity data.\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nHydrostatic Figure of Shape of Earth : theoretical shape of the Earth if\nwe know density ρ and rotation ω (ellipsoid of revolution).\nWe will now derive the shape of the reference spheroid; this concept is very\nimportant for geodesy since it underlies the definition of the International Grav\nity Formula. Also, it introduces (zonal, i.e. longitude independent) spherical\nharmonics in a natural way.\n2.2\nGravitational potential due to nearly spher\nical body\nHow can we determine the shape of the reference spheroid? The flattening of\nthe earth was already discovered and quantified by the end of the 18th cen\ntury. It was noticed that the distance between a degree of latitude as mea\nsured, for instance with a sextant, differs from that expected from a sphere:\nRE (θ1 - θ2) = RE dθ, with RE the radius of the Earth, θ1 and θ2 two different\nlatitudes (see Figure 2.5).\nFigure 2.5: Ellipticity of the Earth measured by the\ndistance between latitudes of the Earth and a sphere.\nIn 1743, Clairaut1 showed that the reference spheroid can also be computed\ndirectly from the measured gravity field g. The derivation is based on the\ncomputation of a potential U (P ) at point P due to a nearly spherical body, and\nit is only valid for points outside (or, in the limit, on the surface of) the body.\nThe contribution dU to the gravitational potential at P due to a mass ele\nment dM at distance q from P is given by\nG\ndU = -\ndM\n(2.16)\nq\nTypically, the potential is expanded in a series. This can be done in two\nways, which lead to the same results. One can write U (P ) directly in terms\nof the known solutions of Laplace's equation (∇2U = 0), which are spherical\nharmonics. Alternatively, one can expand the term 1/q and integrate the re\nsulting series term by term. Here, we will do the latter because it gives better\n1 In his book, Th eorie de la Figure de la Terre.\n\n2.2.

A formal\ntreatment of solutions of spherical harmonics as solutions of Laplace's equation\nfollows later. The derivation discussed here leads to what is known as MacCul-\nlagh's formula2 and shows how the gravity measurements themselves are used\nto define the reference spheroid.

Legendre\npolynomials are defined as\n1 dl (μ2 - 1)l\nPl(μ) =\n(2.23)\n2ll!\ndμl\nwith μ some function. In our case we take μ = cos θ so that the superposition of\nthe Legendre polynomials describes the variation of the potential with latitude.\nAt this stage we ignore variations with longitude.

In our case,\nwe have chosen O as the center of mass and rcm = 0 with respect to O.\nAnother way to see that this integral must vanish is to realize that the\nintegration over dM is essentially an integration over θ between 0 and\n2π and that cos θ = - cos( π - θ). Integration over θ takes s cos θ back\nand forth over the line between O and P (within the body) with equal\ncontributions from each side of O, since O is the center of mass.\n3.\ns2 dM represents the torque of a distance squared and a mass, which\nunderlies the definition of the moment of inertia (recall that for a ho\nmogeneous sphere with radius R and mass M the moment of inertia is 0.4\nMR2). The moment of inertia is defined as I =\nr2 dM . When talking\nabout moments of inertia one must identify the axis of rotation. We can\nunderstand the meaning of the third integral by introducing a coordinate\nsystem x, y, z so that s = (x, y, z), s2 = x2 + y2 + z\nso that\ns2 dM =\n(y2\n(x2\n(x2 + y2 + z2) dM = 1/2[\n+ z2) dM + (x2 + z2) dM +\n+ y2) dM ]\n(y2\n(x2\n(x2\nand by realizing that\n+ z2) dM,\n+ z2) dM and\n+ y2) dM\nare the moments of inertia around the x-, y-, and z-axis respectively. See\nIntermezzo 2.5 for more on moments of inertia.\nWith the moments of inertia defined as in the box we can rewrite the third\nterm in the potential equation\nG\nG\n-\ns 2 dM = - 2r3 (A + B + C)\n(2.27)\nr3\n4.\ns2 sin2 θ dM . Here, s sin θ projects s on a plane perpendicular to OP and\nthis integral thus represents the moment of inertia of the body around OP .\nThis moment is often denoted by I.\nEq. (2.20) can then be rewritten as\nGM\nG\nU (P ) = -\n- 2r3 (A + B + C - 3I)\n(2.28)\nr\nwhich is known as MacCullagh's formula.\nAt face value this seems to be the result of a straightforward and rather\nboring derivation, but it does reveal some interesting and important properties\nof the potential and the related field. Equation (2.20) basically shows that in\nabsence of rotation the gravitational attraction of an irregular body has two\ncontributions; the first is the attraction of a point mass located at the center of\ngravity, the second term depends on the moments of inertia around the principal\naxes, which in turn depend completely on the shape of the body, or, more\nprecisely, on the deviations of the shape from a perfect sphere. This second\n\n2.2. GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL DUE TO NEARLY SPHERICAL BODY43\nterm decays as 1/r3 so that at large distances the potential approaches that of\na point mass M and becomes less and less sensitive to aspherical variations in\nthe shape of the body. This simply implies that if you're interested in small\nscale deviations from spherical symmetry you should not be to far away from\nthe surface: i.e. it's better to use data from satellites with a relatively low\norbit. This phenomenon is in fact an example of up (or down)ward continuation,\nwhich we will discuss more quantitatively formally when introducing spherical\nharmonics.\n\nCHAPTER 2.

GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL DUE TO NEARLY SPHERICAL BODY45\ninertia I around any general axis (here OP ) can be expressed as a linear com\nbination of the moments of inertia around the principal axes. Let l2 , m2, and\nn2 be the squares of the cosines of the angle of the line OP with the x-, y-, and\nz-axis, respectively. With l2 + m2 + n2 = 1 we can write I = l2A + m2B + n2C\n(see Figure 2.7).\nFigure 2.7: Definition of direction cosines.\nSo far we have not been specific about the shape of the body, but for the\nEarth it is relevant to consider rotational geometry so that A = B = C. This\nleads to:\nI = A + (C - A)n 2\n(2.34)\nHere, n = cos θ with θ the angle between OP and the z-axis, that is θ is the\nco-latitude.

THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nIntermezzo 2.6 Ellipticity terms\nLet's briefly return to the equivalence with the spherical harmonic expansion.\nIf we take μ = cos θ (see box) we can write for U (P )\nU (P )\n=\nU (r, θ)\nGM\na\n=\n-\n[J0P0(cos θ) + J1\nP1(cos θ)\nr\nr\na 2\n+\nJ2\nP2(cos θ)]\n(2.39)\nr\nThe expressions (2.20), rewritten as (2.38), and (2.39) are identical if we define\nthe scaling factors Jl as follows. Since P0(cos θ) = 1, J0 must be 1 because\n-GM/r is the far field term; J1 = 0 if the coordinate origin coincides with the\ncenter of mass (see above); and J2 is as defined above. This term is of particular\ninterest since it describes the oblate shape of the geoid. (The higher order terms\n(J4 , J6 etc.) are smaller by a factor of order 1000 and are not carried through\nhere, but they are incorporated in the calculation of the reference spheroid.)\nThe final step towards calculating the reference gravity field is to add a\nrotational potential.\nLet ω = ωˆ be the angular velocity of rotation around the z-axis. The\nz\nchoice of reference frame is important to get the plus and minus signs right. A\nparticle that moves with the rotating earth is influenced by a centripetal force\nFcp = ma, which can formally be written in terms of the cross products between\nthe angular velocity ω and the position vector as mω × (ω × s). This shows\nthat the centripetal acceleration points to the rotation axis. The magnitude of\nthe force per unit mass is sω2 = rω2 cos λ. The source of Fcp is, in fact, the\nFcp\ngravitational attraction g (geff + Fcp = g). The effective gravity geff = g - m\nm\n(see Figure 2.8). Since we are mainly interested in the radial component (the\ntangential component is very small) we can write geff = g - rω2 cos2 λ.\nFigure 2.8: The gravitational attraction produces the centripetal force due to\nthe rotation of the Earth.\nIn terms of potentials, the rotational potential has to be added to the grav\n\n2.2.

Hint: use the above diagram and consider the symmetry of the problem)\nThe geopotential can now be written as\nGM\nG\nU (r, θ) = -\n+\nJ2Ma2\n3 cos 2 θ -\n- r 2ω2 sin2 θ\n(2.41)\nr\nr3\nwhich describes the contribution to the potential due to the central mass, the\noblate shape of the Earth (i.e. flattening due to rotation), and the rotation\nitself.\nWe can also write the geopotential in terms of the latitude by substituting\n(sin λ = cos θ):\nGM\nG\nU (r, λ) = -\n+ r3 (C - A)\nsin2 λ - 1\n- r 2ω2 cos 2 λ\n(2.42)\nr\nWe now want to use this result to find an expression for the gravity potential\nand acceleration at the surface of the (reference) spheroid. The flattening is\ndetermined from the geopotential by defining the equipotential U0, the surface\nof constant U .\nSince U0 is an equipotential, U must be the same (U0) for a point at the\npole and at the equator. We take c for the polar radius and a for the equatorial\nradius and write:\nU0,pole = U (c, 90) = U0,equator = U (a, 0)\n(2.43)\nGM\nG\nUpole\n= -\n+ c3 J2Ma2\n(2.44)\nc\nGM\nG\nUequator\n= -\n-\nJ2Ma2 - 1 a 2ω2\n(2.45)\na\n2a3\n(2.46)\nand after some reordering to isolate a and c we get\na - c\nJ2Ma2\naω2\nf ≡\n≈\n+\n= J2 + m\n(2.47)\na\nMa2\n2 GM/a2\nWhich basically shows that the geometrical flattening f as defined by the\nrelative difference between the polar and equatorial radius is related to the\nellipticity coefficient J2 and the ratio m between the rotational (aω2) to the\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\ngravitational (GMa-2) component of gravity at the equator. The value for the\nflattening f can be accurately determined from orbital data; in fact within a\nyear after the launch of the first artificial satellite -- by the soviets -- this\nvalue could be determined with much more accuracy than by estimates given\nby many investigators in the preceding centuries. The geometrical flattening\nis small (f = 1/298.257 ≈ 1/300) (but larger than expected from equilibrium\nflattening of a rotating body). The difference between the polar and equatorial\nradii is thus about REf = 6371km/300 ≈ 21 km.\nIn order to get the shape of the reference geoid (or spheroid) one can use the\nassumption that the deviation from a sphere is small, and we can thus assume\nthe vector from the Earth's center to a point at the reference geoid to be of the\nform\nrg ∼ r0 + dr = r0(1 + ε)\nor,\n\nwith\nr0 = a , rg ∼ a(1 + ε)\n(2.48)\nIt can be shown that ε can be written as a function of f and latitude as given\nby: rg ∼ a(1 - f sin2 λ) and (from binomial expansion) rg\n-2 ≈ a-2(1 + 2f sin2 λ).\nGeoid anomalies, i.e. the geoid \"highs\" and \"lows\" that people talk about are\ndeviations from the reference geoid and they are typically of the order of several\ntens of meters (with a maximum (absolute) value of about 100 m near India),\nwhich is small (often less than 0.5%) compared to the latitude dependence of\nthe radius (see above). So the reference geoid with r = rg according to (2.48)\ndoes a pretty good job in representing the average geoid.\nFinally, we can determine the gravity field at the reference geoid with a shape\nas defined by (2.48) calculating the gradient of eqn.

Somigliana.\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\n2.3\nThe Poisson and Laplace equations\nThe gravitational field of the Earth is caused by its density. The mass distri\nbution of the planet is inherently three-dimensional, but we mortals will always\nonly scratch at the surface. The most we can do is measure the gravitational\nacceleration at the Earth's surface. However, thanks to a fundamental relation\nship known as Gauss's Theorem5, the link between a surface observable and\nthe properties of the whole body in question can be found. Gauss's theorem is\none of a class of theorems in vector analysis that relates integrals of different\ntypes (line, surface, volume integrals). Stokes's, Greens and Gauss's theorem\nare fundamental in the study of potential fields. The theorem due to Gauss\nrelates the integral over the volume of some property (most generally, a tensor\nT) to a surface integral. It is also called the divergence theorem. Let V be a\nvolume bounded by the surface S = ∂V (see Figure 2.9). A differential patch\nof surface dS can be represented by an outwardly pointing vector with a length\ncorresponding to the area of the surface element. In terms of a unit normal\nvector, it is given by ˆn∥dS∥.\nV\nds = n|ds|\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 2.9: Surface enclosing a volume. Unit normal vector.\nGauss's theorem (for generic \"stuff\" T) is as follows:\n\n∇ · T dV =\nˆn · T dS.\n(2.58)\nV\n∂V\nLet's see what we can infer about the gravitational potential within the\nEarth using only information obtained at the surface. Remember we had\nGM\ng =\nand g = -∇U.\n(2.59)\nr2\n5After Carl-Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855).\n\n2.3. THE POISSON AND LAPLACE EQUATIONS\nSuppose we measure g everywhere at the surface, and sum the results. What\nwe get is the flux of the gravity field\ng · dS.\n(2.60)\n∂V\nAt this point, we can already predict that if S is the surface enclosing the\nEarth, the flux of the gravity field should be different from zero, and further\nmore, that it should have something to do with the density distribution within\nthe planet. Why? Because the gravitational field lines all point towards the\ncenter of mass. If the flux was zero, the field would be said to be solenoidal\n. Unlike the magnetic field the gravity field is essentially a monopole. For the\nmagnetic field, field lines both leave and enter the spherical surface because\nthe Earth has a positive and a negative pole. The gravitational field is only\nsolenoidal in regions not occupied by mass.\nAnyway, we'll start working with Eq. 2.60 and see what we come up with.\nOn the one hand (we use Eq. 2.58 and Eq. 2.59)6 ,\ng · ˆn dS =\n∇ · g dV = -\n∇ · ∇U dV = -\n∇2U dV.\n(2.61)\n∂V\nV\nV\nV\nOn the other hand (we use the definition of the dot product and Eq. 2.59,\nand define gn as the component of g normal to dS):\ng · ˆn dS = -\ngn dS = -4πr2 GM = -4πG\nρ dV .\n(2.62)\nr2\n∂V\n∂V\nV\nWe've assumed that S is a spherical surface, but the derivation will work for\nany surface. Equating Eq. 2.61 and 2.62, we can state that\n∇2U (r) = 4πGρ(r)\nPoisson's Equation\n(2.63)\nand in the homogeneous case\n∇2U (r) = 0\nLaplace's Equation\n(2.64)\nThe interpretation in terms of sources and sinks of the potential fields and\nits relation with the field lines is summarized in Figure 2.10:\nPoisson's equation is a fundamental result. It implies\n1. that the total mass of a body (say, Earth) can be determined from mea\nsurements of ∇U = -g at the surface (see Eq. 2.62), and\n2. no information is required about how exactly the density is distributed\nwithin V\n6 Note that the identity ∇2U = ∇ · ∇U is true for scalar fields, but for a vector field V we\nshould have written ∇2 V = ∇(∇ · V) - ∇ × (∇ × V).\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nFigure 2.10: Poisson's and Laplace's equations.\nIf there is no potential source (or sink) enclosed by S Laplace's equation\nshould be applied to find the potential at a point P outside the surface S that\ncontains all attracting mass, for instance the potential at the location of a\nsatellite. But in the limit, it is also valid at the Earth's surface. Similarly, we\nwill see that we can use Laplace's equation to describe Earth's magnetic field\nas long as we are outside the region that contains the source for the magnetic\npotential (i.e., Earth's core).\nWe often have to find a solution for U of Laplace's equation when only the\nvalue of U , or its derivatives |∇U | = g are known at the surface of a sphere. For\ninstance if one wants to determine the internal mass distribution of the Earth\nfrom gravity data. Laplace's equation is easier to solve than Poisson's equation.\nIn practice one can usually (re)define the problem in such a way that one can\nuse Laplace's equation by integrating over contributions from small volumes dV\n(containing the source of the potential dU , i.e., mass dM ), see Figure 2.11 or\nby using Newton's Law of Gravity along with Laplace's equation in an iterative\nway.\nFigure 2.11: Applicability of Poisson's and Laplaces' equations.\nSee Intermezzo 2.7.\n\n2.4. CARTESIAN AND SPHERICAL COORDINATE SYSTEMS\nIntermezzo 2.7 Non-uniqueness\nOne can prove that the solution of Laplace's equation can be uniquely deter\nmined if the boundary conditions are known (i.e. if data coverage at the surface\nis good); in other words, if there are two solutions U1 and U2 that satisfy the\nboundary conditions, U1 and U2 can be shown to be identical. The good news\nhere is that once you find a solution for U of ∇2U = 0 that satisfies the BC's\nyou do not have to be concerned about the generality of the solution. The bad\nnews is (see also point (2) above) that the solution of Laplace's equation does\nnot constrain the variations of density within V . This leads to a fundamental\nnon-uniqueness which is typical for potentials of force fields. We have seen this\nbefore: the potential at a point P outside a spherically symmetric body with to\ntal mass M is the same as the potential of a point mass M located in the center\nO. In between O and P the density in the spherical shells can be distributed in\nan infinite number of different ways, but the potential at P remains the same.\n2.4\nCartesian and spherical coordinate systems\nIn Cartesian coordinates we write for ∇2 (the Laplacian)\n∂2\n∂2\n∂2\n∇2 =\n+\n+\n.\n(2.65)\n∂x2\n∂y2\n∂z2\nFor the Earth, it is advantageous to use spherical coordinates. These are\ndefined as follows (see Figure 2.12):\n⎧\n⎨ x = r sin θ cos φ\ny\n= r sin θ sin φ\n(2.66)\n⎩ z\n= r cos θ\nFigure 2.12: Definition of r, θ\nand φ in the spherical coordinate\nsystem.\nwhere θ = 0 → π = co-latitude, φ = 0 → 2π = longitude.\nIt is very important to realize that, whereas the Cartesian frame is described\nby the immobile unit vectors ˆ\nˆ\nz, the unit vectors ˆ\nˆ are\nx, y and ˆ\nr, θˆ and φ\ndependent on the position of the point. They are local axes. At point P, ˆr\npoints in the direction of increasing radius from the origin, θˆ in the direction of\nincreasing colatitude θ and ˆφ in the direction of increasing longitude φ.\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nOne can go between coordinate axes by the transformation\n⎛\n⎞\n⎛\n⎞⎛\n⎞\n⎝ θ\nφ\nˆr\nˆ\nˆ\nsin θ cos φ\nsin θ sin φ\ncos θ\ncos θ cos φ cos θ sin φ - sin θ\nˆx\nˆy\nˆz\n⎠\n(2.67)\n=\n⎠\n⎝\n⎠⎝\n- sin φ\ncos φ\nFurthermore, we need to remember that integration over a volume element\ndx dy dz becomes, after changing of variables r2 sin θ dr dθ dφ.\nThis\nmay\nbe\n\nremembered by the fact that r2 sin θ is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix,\ni.e. the matrix obtained by filling a 3×3 matrix with all partial derivatives of\nEq. 2.66. After some algebra, we can write the spherical Laplacian:\n∂U\n∂\n∂U\n∇2U = 1 ∂\nr\n+\nsin θ\n+\n∂2U\n= 0.(2.68)\nr2 ∂r\n∂r\nr2 sin θ ∂θ\n∂θ\nr2 sin2 θ\n∂φ2\n2.5\nSpherical harmonics\nWe now attempt to solve Laplace's Equation ∇2U = 0, in spherical coordinates.\nLaplace's equation is obeyed by potential fields outside the sources of the field.\nRemember how sines and cosines (or in general, exponentials) are often solutions\nto differential equations, of the form sin kx or cos kx, whereby k can take any\ninteger value. The general solution is any combination of sines and cosines of\nall possible k's with weights that can be determined by satisfying the boundary\nconditions (BC's). The particular solution is constructed by finding a linear\ncombination of these (basis) functions with weighting coefficients dictated by\nthe BC's: it is a series solution. In the Cartesian case they are Fourier Series.\nIn Fourier theory, a signal, say a time series s(t), for instance a seismogram, can\nbe represented by the superposition of cos and sin functions and weights can be\nfound which approximate the signal to be analyzed in a least-squares sense.\nSpherical harmonics are solutions of the spherical Laplace's Equation: they\nare basically an adaption of Fourier analysis to a spherical surface. Just like\nwith Fourier series, the superposition of spherical harmonics can be used to\nrepresent and analyze physical phenomena distributed on the surface on (or\nwithin) the Earth. Still in analogy with Fourier theory, there exists a sampling\ntheorem which requires that sufficient data are provided in order to make the\nsolution possible. In geophysics, one often talks about (spatial) data coverage,\nwhich must be adequate.\nWe can find a solution for U of ∇2U = 0 by the good old trick of separation\nof variables. We look for a solution with the following structure:\nU(r, θ, φ) = R(r)P(θ)Q(φ)\n(2.69)\nLet's take each factor separately. In the following, an outline is given of how\nto find the solution of this elliptic equation, but working this out rigorously\nrequires some more effort than you might be willing to spend. But let's not try\nto lose the physical meaning what we come up with.\n\n2.5. SPHERICAL HARMONICS\nRadial dependence: R(r)\nIt turns out that the functions satisfying Laplace's Equation belong to a special\nclass of homogeneous7 harmonic8 functions. A first property of homogeneous\nfunctions that can be used to our advantage is that in general, a homogeneous\nfunction can be written in two different forms:\nU1(r, θ, φ)\n=\nr lYl(θ, φ)\n(2.70)\n1 (l+1)\nU2(r, θ, φ)\n=\n\nYl(θ, φ)\n(2.71)\nr\nThis, of course, gives the form of our radial function:\nlr\nR(r) =\nl+1\n(2.72)\nr\nThe two alternatives R(r) = rl and R(r) = (1/r)l+1 describe the behavior\nof U for an external and internal field, respectively (in- and outside the mass\ndistribution). Whether to use R(r) = rl and R(r) = (1/r)l+1 depends on the\nproblem you're working on and on the boundary conditions. If the problem\nrequires a finite value for U at r = 0 than we need to use R(r) = rl . However if\nwe require U →0 for r →infthen we have to use R(r) = (1/r)l+1 . The latter\nis appropriate for representing the potential outside the surface that encloses\nall sources of potential, such as the gravity potential U = GM r-1 . However,\nboth are needed when we describe the magnetic potential at point r due to an\ninternal and external field.\nLongitudinal dependence: Q(φ)\nSubstitution of Eq. 2.69 into Laplace's equation with R(r) given by Eq. 2.72,\nand dividing Eq. 2.69 out again yields an equation in which θ- and φ-derivatives\noccur on separate sides of the equation sign. For arbitrary θ and φ this must\nmean:\nd2\ndφ2 Q\n-\n= constant,\n(2.73)\nQ\nwhich is best solved by calling the constant m2 and solving for Q as:\nQ(φ) = A cos mφ + B sin mφ.\n(2.74)\nIndeed, all possible constants A and B give valid solutions, and m must be a\npositive integer.\n7 A homogenous function f of degree n satisfies f(tx, ty, tz) = tn f(x, y, z).\n8 By definition, a function which satisfies Laplace's equation is called harmonic.\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nLatitudinal dependence: P (θ)\nThe condition is similar, except it involves both l and m. After some rearrang\ning, one arrives at\nsin θ d\nsin θ d P (θ) + [l(l + 1) sin 2 θ - m 2]P (θ) = 0.\n(2.75)\ndθ\ndθ\nThis equation is the associated Legendre Equation. It turns out that\nthe space of the homogeneous functions has a dimension 2l +1, hence 0 ≤ m ≤ l.\nIf we substitute cos θ = z, Eq. 2.75 becomes\n(1 - z 2) d2\nP (z) - 2z d P + l(l + 1) - m\nP (z) = 0.\n(2.76)\ndz2\ndz\n1 - z2\nEq. 2.76 is in standard form and can be solved using a variety of techniques.\nMost commonly, the solutions are found as polynomials P m(cos θ). The asso\nl\nciated Legendre Equation reduces to the Legendre Equation in case m = 0. In\nthe latter case, the longitudinal dependence is lost as also Eq. 2.74 reverts to a\nconstant. The resulting functions Pl(cos θ) have a rotational symmetry around\nthe z-axis. They are called zonal functions.\nIt is possible to find expressions of the (associated) Legendre polynomials\nthat summarize their behavior as follows:\n1 dl\nPl(z)\n=\n\n2 - 1)l\n(2.77)\n2ll! dzl (z\ndl+m\n(1 - z2)\nm\nP m(z)\n=\n\n(z 2 - 1)l ,\n(2.78)\nl\nl!2l\ndzl+m\nwritten in terms of the (l + m)th derivative and z = cos θ. It is easy to make a\nsmall table with these polynomials (note that in Table 2.1, we have used some\ntrig rules to simplify the expressions.) -- this should get you started in using\nEqs. 2.77 or 2.78.\nl\nPl(z)\nz\n2 (3z2 - 1)\n2 (5z3 - 3z)\nPl(θ)\ncos θ\n4 (3 cos 2θ + 1)\n8 (5 cos 3θ + 3 cos θ)\nTable 2.1: Legendre polynomials.\nSome Legendre functions are plotted in Figure 2.13.\n\n2.5.

For unequal data distributions,\northogonality relationship -- out comes A\nthe coefficients may be found in a least-squares sense.\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nVisualization\nIt is important to visualize the behavior of spherical harmonics, as in Figure\n2.14.\nFigure 2.14: Some spherical harmonics.\nSome terminology to remember is that on the basis of the values of l and m\none identifies three types of harmonics.\nThe zonal harmonics are defined to be those of the form Pl (cos θ) =\n-\nPl(cos θ). The superposition of these Legendre polynomials describe vari\nations with latitude; they do not depend on longitude. Zonal harmonics\nvanish at l small circles on the globe, dividing the spheres into latitudinal\nzones.\nThe sectorial harmonics are of the form sin(mφ)P m\nm (cos θ) or\n-\ncos(mφ)P m\nm (cos θ). As they vanish at 2m meridians (longitudinal lines, so\nm great circles), they divide the sphere into sectors.\nThe tesseral harmonics are those of the form sin(mφ)P m\nl (cos θ)\n-\nor cos(mφ)P m\nl (cos θ) for l = m. The amplitude of a surface spherical\n\n2.5. SPHERICAL HARMONICS\nharmonic of a certain degree l and order m vanishes at 2m meridians of\nlongitude and on (l - m) parallels of latitude.\nIntermezzo 2.8 Cartesian vs spherical representation\nIf you work on a small scale with local gravity anomalies (for instance in explo\nration geophysics) it is not efficient to use (global) basis functions on a sphere\nbecause the number of coefficients that you'd need would simply be too large.\nFor example to get resolution of length scales of 100 km (about 1*) you need to\nexpand up to degree l=360 which with all the combinations 0 < m < l involves\nseveral hundreds of thousands of coefficients (how many exactly?). Instead you\nwould use a Fourier Series. The concept is similar to spherical harmonics. A\nFourier series is just a superposition of harmonic functions (sine and cosine func\ntions) with different frequencies (or wave numbers k = 2π/λ, λ the wavelength):\n2πz\n2πx\n-\ngz = constant · sin(kx x)e -kxz = constant · sin\ne\nλx\n(2.82)\nλx\n(For a 2D field the expression includes y but is otherwise be very similar.) Or,\nin more general form\ninf\n\nnπz\n\nnπx\nnπx\n-\ngz =\nan cos\n+ bn sin\ne\nλx\n(2.83)\nλx\nλx\nn=0\n(compare to the expression of the spherical harmonics). In this expression the\nup- and downward continuation of the 1D or 2D harmonic field is controlled by\nan exponential form. The problem with downward continuation becomes imme\ndiately clear from the following example. Suppose in a marine gravity expedition\nto investigate density variation in the sediments beneath the sea floor, say, at 2\nkm depth, gravity measurements are taken at 10 m intervals on the sea surface\n(x0 specifies the size of the grid at which the measurements are made). Upon\ndownward continuation, the signal associated with the smallest wavelength al\nlowed by such grid spacing would be amplified by a factor of exp(2000π/10) =\nexp(200π) ≈ 10273 . (The water does not contain any concentrations of mass\nthat contribute to the gravity anomalies and integration over the surface enclos\ning the water mass would add only a constant value to the gravity potential but\nthat is irrelevant when studying anomalies, and Laplace's equation can still be\nused.) So it is important to filter the data before the downward continuation\nso that information is maintained only on length scales that are not too much\nsmaller than the distance over which the downward continuation has to take\nplace.\nIn other words the degree l gives the total number of nodal lines and the\norder m controls how this number is distributed over nodal meridians and nodal\nparallels. The higher the degree and order the finer the detail that can be\nrepresented, but increasing l and m only makes sense if data coverage is sufficient\nto constrain the coefficients of the polynomials.\nA different rendering is given in Figure 2.15.\nAn important property follows from the depth dependence of the solution:\nFrom eqn. (2.80) we can see that (1) the amplitude of all terms will decrease\nwith increasing distance from the origin (i.e., the internal source of the potential)\n\n2.6. GLOBAL GRAVITY ANOMALIES\nSo in terms of a surface spherical harmonic potential U (l) on the unit circle,\nwe get the following equations for the field in- and outside the mass distribution:\nr l\nU in(r, l)\n=\n\nU (l)\na\na l+1\nU out(r, l)\n=\n\nU (l)\n(2.87)\nr\nFor gravity, this becomes:\nl\nin\ng (r, l)\n=\n-\nr l-1U (l)ˆr\nal\nout\ng\n(r, l)\n=\na l+1(l + 1) rl+1 U (l)ˆ\n(2.88)\nr\nWhat is the gravity due to a thin sheet of mass of spherical harmonic degree\nl? Let's represent this as a sheet with vanishing thickness, and call σ(l) the mass\ndensity per unit area. This way we can work at constant r and use the results\nfor spherical symmetry. We know from Gauss's law that the flux through any\nsurface enclosing a bit of mass is equal to the total enclosed mass (times -4πG).\nSo constructing a box around a patch of surface S with area dS, enclosing a bit\nof mass dM , we can deduce that\ngout - gin = 4πGσ(l)\n(2.89)\nOn this shell -- give it a radius a, we can use Eqs. 2.88 to find gout =\nU (l)(l + 1)/a and -gin = -U (l)l/a, and solve for U (l) using Eq. 2.89 as U (l) =\n4πGσ(l)a/(2l + 1). Plugging this into Eqs. 2.88 again we get for the gravity in-\nand outside this mass distribution\n4πGl\nrl-1\nin\ng (r, l)\n=\n\nσ(l) al-1\n2l + 1\n4πGl(l + 1)\nal+2\nout\ng\n(r, l)\n=\n\nσ(l) rl+2\n(2.90)\n2l + 1\nLength scales\nMeasurements of gravitational attraction are -- as we have seen -- useful in the\ndetermination of the shape and rotational properties of the Earth. This is im\nportant for geodesy. In addition, they also provide information about aspherical\ndensity variations in the lithosphere and mantle (important for understanding\ndynamical processes, interpretation of seismic images, or for finding mineral de\nposits). However, before gravity measurements can be used for interpretation\nseveral corrections will have to be made: the data reductions plays an important\nrole in gravimetry since the signal pertinent to the structures we are interested\nin is very small.\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nLet's take a step back and get a feel for the different length scales and\nprobable sources involved. If we use a spherical harmonic expansion of the\nfield U we can see that it's the up- or downward continuation of the field and\nits dependence on r and degree l that controls the behavior of the solution at\ndifferent depths (or radius) (remember Eq. 2.87).\nWith increasing r from the source the amplitude of the surface harmonics\nbecome smaller and smaller, and the decay in amplitude (spatial attenuation)\nis stronger for the higher degrees l (i.e., the small-scale structures).\nTable 2.2 gives and idea about the relationship between length scales, the\nprobable source regions, and where the measurements have to be taken.\nλ\n(λ <\nl > 36)\n(λ >\nl < 36)\nwavelength\nshort wavelength\nlong wavelength\n1000 km or\n1000 km or\nSource region\nshallow:\nprobably deep\ncrust, lithosphere\n(lower mantle) but shallower\nsource cannot be excluded\nMeasurement:\nclose to source: surface,\nLarger distance from origin\nhow, where?\nsea level, \"low orbit\"\nof anomalies; perturbations\nsatellites, planes\nof satellite orbits\nRepresentation\nvalues at grid points;\nspherical harmonics\n2D Fourier series\nCoordinate system\ncartesian\nspherical\nTable 2.2: Wavelength ranges of gravity anomalies\nThe free-air gravity anomaly\nLet's assume that the geoid height N with respect to the spheroid is due to an\nanomalous mass dM. If dM represents excess mass, the equipotential is warped\noutwards and there will be a geoid high (N > 0); conversely, if dM represents\na mass deficiency, N < 0 and there will be a geoid low.\nWe can represent the two potentials as follows: the actual geoid, U(r, θ, φ)\nis an equipotential surface with the same potential W0 as the reference geoid U0,\nonly\nU(r, θ, φ) = U0(r, θ, φ) + ∆U(r, θ, φ)\n(2.91)\nWe define the free-air gravity anomaly as the gravity g(P) measured at point\nP minus the gravity at the projection Q of this point onto the reference geoid\nat r0, g0(Q).

Now for the gravity vectors g and\ng0, they are given by the familiar expressions\ng = -∇U\ng0\n= -∇U0\n(2.96)\nand the gravity disturbance vector δg = g - g0 can be defined as the\ndifference between those two quantities:\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nFigure 2.17: Derivation. Note that in this figure, the\nsign convention for the gravity is reversed; we have\nused and are using that the gravity is the negative\ngradient of the potential.\nδg = -∇∆U\n∂∆U\nδg = g - g0 = -\n(2.97)\n∂r\nOn the other hand, from a first-order expansion, we learn that\ndg0 N\ng0(P ) = g0(Q) +\ndr\nr0\ndg0\nd∆U\ng(P ) = g0(Q) +\nN -\n(2.98)\ndr\n\ndr\nr0\n(2.99)\nNow we define the free-air gravity anomaly as the difference of the gravi\ntational accelartion measured on the actual geoid (if you're on a mountain you'll\nneed to refer to sea level) minus the reference gravity:\n∆g = g(P ) - g0(Q)\n(2.100)\nThis translates into\ndg0\n∂∆U\n∆g =\nN -\ndr\n\n∂r\nr0\n\n2.6.

The latter term is essentially a free air correction, similar to the\none one has to apply when referring the measurement (on a mountain, say) to\nthe actual geoid (sea level).\nNote that Eq. (2.95) contains the boundary conditions of ∇2U = 0. The\ngeoid height N at any point depends on the total effect of mass excesses and de\nficiencies over the Earth. N can be determined uniquely at any point (θ, φ) from\nmeasurements of gravity anomalies taken over the surface of the whole Earth\n-- this was first done by Stokes (1849) -- but it does not uniquely constrain\nthe distribution of masses.\nGravity anomalies from geoidal heights\nA convenient way to determine the geoid heights N(θ, φ) from either the poten\ntial field anomalies ∆U(θ, φ) or the gravity anomalies ∆g(θ, φ) is by means of\nspherical harmonic expansion of N(θ, φ) in terms of ∆U(θ, φ) or ∆g(θ, φ).\nIt's convenient to just give the coefficients of Eq. 2.86 since the basic ex\npressions are the same. Let's see how that notation would work for eq. (2.86):\nUA\nGM\nAm\nl\n= -\n(2.103)\nBm\nUB\na\nl\nNote that the subscripts A and B are used to label the coefficients of the\ncos mφ and sin mφ parts, respectively. Note also that we have now taken the\nfactor -GM a-l as the scaling factor of the coefficients.\nWe can also expand the potential U0 on the reference spheroid:\nm\nU0,A\n= - GM\nAl\n(2.104)\nU0,B\na\n(Note that we did not drop the m , even though m = 0 for the zonal harmonics\nused for the reference spheroid. We just require the coefficient A m to be zero\nl\nfor m = 0. By doing this we can keep the equations simple.)\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nThe coefficients of the anomalous potential ∆U(θ, φ) are then given by:\n∆UA\nGM\n(Am\nl\nm\nl )\n-A\n= -\n(2.105)\n∆UB\na\nBm\nl\nWe can now expand ∆g(θ, φ) in a similar series using eq. (2.101). For the\n∆U, we can see by inspection that the radial derivative as prescribed has the\nfollowing effect on the coefficients (note that the reference radius r0 = a from\nearlier definitions):\nd∆U\nl + 1\n→-\n(2.106)\ndr\nr0\nand the other term of Eq. 2.101 brings down\n∆U →\n(2.107)\nr0\na\nAs a result, we get\n\nGM\nl + 1\n(A\n∆gA\n=\nm\nl\nm\nl )\n-A\n-\n-\n(2.108)\n∆gB\na\na\nBm\nl\nm\nl\nm\nl )\n(A\n-A\n= g0(l -1)\n(2.109)\nm\nl\nB\nThe proportionality with (l -1)g0 means that the higher degree terms are\nmagnified in the gravity field relative to those in the potential field. This leads to\nthe important result that gravity maps typically contain much more detail than\ngeoid maps because the spatial attenuation of the higher degree components is\nsuppressed.\nUsing Eq. (2.95) we can express the coefficients of the expansion of N(θ, φ)\nin terms of either the coefficients of the expanded anomalous potential\nNA\nGM\n(A\n=\nm\nl\nm\nl )\n(2.110)\n-A\ng0\nNB\na\nBm\nl\nwhich, if we replace g by g and by assuming that g ≈g gets the following form\nNA\n(A\n= a\nm\nl\nm\nl )\n(2.111)\n-A\nNB\nBm\nl\nor in terms of the coefficients of the gravity anomalies (eqns. 2.109 and 2.111)\nNA\na\n∆gA\n(A\n=\n= a\nm\nl\nm\nl )\n-A\n(2.112)\nNB\n(l -1)g0\n∆gB\nBm\nl\nThe geoid heights can thus be synthesized from the expansions of either the\ngravity anomalies (2.112) or the anomalous potential (2.111). Geoid anomalies\n\n2.7. GRAVITY ANOMALIES AND THE REDUCTION OF GRAVITY DATA67\nhave been constructed from both surface measurements of gravity (2.112) and\nfrom satellite observations (2.111). Equation (2.112) indicates that relative to\nthe gravity anomalies, the coefficients of N(θ, φ) are suppressed by a factor of\n1/(l - 1). As a result, shorter wavelength features are much more prominent on\ngravity maps. In other words, geoid (and geoid height) maps essentially depict\nthe low harmonics of the gravitational field. A final note that is relevant for the\nreduction of the gravity data. Gravity data are typically reduced to sea-level,\nwhich coincides with the geoid and not with the actual reference spheroid. Eq.\n8 can then be used to make the additional correction to the reference spheroid,\nwhich effectively means that the long wavelength signal is removed. This results\nin very high resolution gravity maps.\n2.7\nGravity anomalies and the reduction of grav\nity data\nThe combination of the reduced gravity field and the topography yields impor\ntant information on the mechanical state of the crust and lithosphere. Both\ngravity and topography can be obtained by remote sensing and in many cases\nthey form the basis of our knowledge of the dynamical state of planets, such\nas Mars, and natural satellites, such as Earth's Moon. Data reduction plays\nan important role in gravity studies since the signal caused by the aspherical\nvariation in density that one wants to study are very small compared not only\nto the observed field but also other effects, such as the influence of the position\nat which the measurement is made. The following sum shows the various com\nponents to the observed gravity, with the name of the corresponding corrections\nthat should be made shown in parenthesis:\nObserved gravity = attraction of the reference spheroid, PLUS:\n- effects of elevation above sea level (Free Air correction), which should\ninclude the elevation (geoid anomaly) of the sea level above the reference\nspheroid\n- effect of \"normal\" attracting mass between observation point and sea level\n(Bouguer and terrain correction)\n- effect of masses that support topographic loads (isostatic correction)\n- time-dependent changes in Earth's figure of shape (tidal correction)\n- effect of changes in the rotation term due to motion of the observation\npoint (e.g. when measurements are made from a moving ship. (E os\notv\ncorrection)\n- effects of crust and mantle density anomalies (\"geology\" or \"geodynamic\nprocesses\").\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nOnly the bold corrections will be discussed here. The tidal correction is\nsmall, but must be accounted for when high precision data are required. The\napplication of the different corrections is illustrated by a simple example of a\nsmall density anomaly located in a topography high that is isostatically com\npensated. See series of diagrams.\nFree Air Anomaly\nSo far it has been assumed that measurements at sea level (i.e. the actual geoid)\nwere available. This is often not the case. If, for instance, g is measured on the\nland surface at an altitude h one has to make the following correction :\nhg\ndgFA = -2\n(2.113)\nr\nFor g at sea level this correction amounts to dgFA = -0.3086h mgal or\n0.3086h × 10-5 ms-2 (h in meter). Note that this assumes no mass between\nthe observer and sea level, hence the name \"free-air\" correction. The effect of\nellipticity is often ignored, but one can use r = Req(1 - fsin2λ). Note: per\nmeter elevation this correction equals 3.1 × 10-6 ms-2 ∼ 3.1 × 10-7g: this is\non the limit of the precision that can be attained by field instruments, which\nshows that uncertainties in elevation are a limiting factor in the precision that\ncan be achieved. (A realistic uncertainty is 1 mgal).\nMake sure the correction is applied correctly, since there can be confusion\nabout the sign of the correction, which depends on the definition of the poten\ntial. The objective of the correction is to compensate for the decrease in gravity\nattraction with increasing distance from the source (center of the Earth). For\nmally, given the minus sign in (2.114), the correction has to be subtracted, but\nit is not uncommon to take the correction as the positive number in which case\nit will have to be added. (Just bear in mind that you have to make the measured\nvalue larger by \"adding\" gravity so it compares directly to the reference value at\nthe same height; alternatively, you can make the reference value smaller if you\nare above sea level; if you are in a submarine you will, of course, have to do the\nopposite).\nThe Free Air anomaly is then obtained by the correction for height above\nsea level and by subtraction of the reference gravity field\n∆gFA = gobs - dgFA - g0(λ) = (gobs + 0.3086h × 10-3) - g0(λ)\n(2.114)\n(Note that there could be a component due to the fact that the sea level (≡ the\ngeoid) does not coincide with the reference spheroid; an additional correction\ncan then be made to take out the extra gravity anomaly. One can simply apply\n(2.114) and use h′ = h + N as the elevation, which is equivalent to adding a\ncorrection to g0(λ) so that it represents the reference value at the geoid. This\ncorrection is not important if the variation in geoid is small across the survey\nregion because then the correction is the same for all data points.)\n\n2.7. GRAVITY ANOMALIES AND THE REDUCTION OF GRAVITY DATA69\nBouguer anomaly\nThe free air correction does not correct for any attracting mass between obser\nvation point and sea level. However, on land, at a certain elevation there will\nbe attracting mass (even though it is often compensated - isostasy (see below)).\nInstead of estimating the true shape of, say, a mountain on which the measure\nment is made, one often resorts to what is known as the \"slab approximation\"\nin which one simply assumes that the rocks are of infinite horizontal extent.\nThe Bouguer correction is then given by\ndgB = 2πGρh\n(2.115)\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, ρ is the assumed mean density of crustal\nrock and h is the height above sea level. For G = 6.67 × 10-11 m3kg-3s-2 and\nρ = 2, 700 kgm-3 we obtain a correction of 1.1×10-6 ms-2 per meter of elevation\n(or 0.11 h mgal, h in meter). If the slab approximation is not satisfactory, for\ninstance near the top of mountains, on has to apply an additional terrain\ncorrection. It is straightforward to apply the terrain correction if one has\naccess to digital topography/bathymetry data.\nThe Bouguer anomaly has to be subtracted, since one wants to remove the\neffects of the extra attraction. The Bouguer correction is typically applied after\nthe application of the Free Air correction. Ignoring the terrain correction, the\nBouguer gravity anomaly is then given by\n∆gB = gobs - dgFA - g0(λ) - dgB = ∆gFA - dgB\n(2.116)\nIn principle, with the Bouguer anomaly we have accounted for the attraction\nof all rock between observation point and sea level, and ∆gB thus represents\nthe gravitational attraction of the material below sea level. Bouguer Anomaly\nmaps are typically used to study gravity on continents whereas the Free Air\nAnomaly is more commonly used in oceanic regions.\nIsostasy and isostatic correction\nIf the mass between the observation point and sea level is all that contributes\nto the measured gravity one would expect that the Free Air anomaly is large,\nand positive over topography highs (since this mass is unaccounted for) and\nthat the Bouguer anomaly decreases to zero. This relationship between the two\ngravity anomalies and topography is indeed what would be obtained in case\nthe mass is completely supported by the strength of the plate (i.e. no isostatic\ncompensation). In early gravity surveys, however, they found that the Bouguer\ngravity anomaly over mountain ranges was, somewhat surprisingly, large and\nnegative. Apparently, a mass deficiency remained after the mass above sea level\nwas compensated for. In other words, the Bouguer correction subtracted too\nmuch! This observation in the 19th century lead Airy and Pratt to develop\nthe concept of isostasy. In short, isostasy means that at depths larger than\na certain compensation depth the observed variations in height above sea level\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nno longer contribute to lateral variations in pressure. In case of Airy Isostasy\nthis is achieved by a compensation root, such that the depth to the interface\nbetween the loading mass (with constant density) and the rest of the mantle\nvaries. This is, in fact Archimedes' Law, and a good example of this mechanism\nis the floating iceberg, of which we see only the top above the sea level. In the\ncase of Pratt Isostasy the compensation depth does not vary and constant\npressure is achieved by lateral variations in density. It is now known that both\nmechanisms play a role.\nA\nB\nh\nb\ns.l.\ns.l.\nH\nW\nρ c\nρ w\nρ w\nρ m\nh\nρ p\nρ0\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 2.18: Airy (left) and Pratt (right) isostasy.\nThe basic equation that describes the relationship between the topographic\nheight and the depth of the compensating body is (see Figure 2.19):\nρch\nH =\n(2.117)\nρm - ρc\n\n2.8. CORRELATION BETWEEN GRAVITY ANOMALIES AND TOPOGRAPHY.71\nFigure 2.19: Airy isostasy.\nAssuming Airy Isostasy and some constant density for crustal rock one can\ncompute H(x, y) from known (digital) topography h(x, y) and thus correct for\nthe mass deficiency. This results in the Isostatic Anomaly. If all is done cor\nrectly the isostatic anomaly isolates the small signal due to the density anomaly\nthat is not compensated (local geology, or geodynamic processes).\n2.8\nCorrelation between gravity anomalies and\ntopography.\nThe correlation between Bouguer and Free Air anomalies on the one hand and\ntopography on the other thus contains information as to what level the topog\nraphy is isostatically compensated.\nIn the case of Airy Isostasy it is obvious that the compensating root causes\nthe mass deficiency that results in a negative Bouguer anomaly. If the topog\nraphy is compensated the mass excess above sea level is canceled by the mass\ndeficiency below it, and as a consequence the Free Air Anomaly is small; usually,\nit is not zero since the attracting mass is closer to the observation point and is\nthus less attenuated than the compensating signal of the mass deficiency so that\nsome correlation between the Free Air Anomaly and topography can remain.\nApart from this effect (which also plays a role near the edges of topographic\nfeatures), the Free air anomaly is close to zero and the Bouguer anomaly large\nand negative when the topography is completely compensated isostatically (also\nreferred to as \"in isostatic equilibrium\").\nIn case the topography is NOT compensated, the Free air anomaly is large\nand positive, and the Bouguer anomaly zero.\n(This also depends on the length scale of the load and the strength of the\nsupporting plate).\nWhether or not a topographic load is or can be compensated depends largely\non the strength (and the thickness) of the supporting plate and on the length\nscale of the loading structure. Intuitively it is obvious that small objects are not\ncompensated because the lithospheric plate is strong enough to carry the load.\nThis explains why impact craters can survive over very long periods of time!\n(Large craters may be isostatically compensated, but the narrow rims of the\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\ncrater will not disappear by flow!) In contrast, loading over large regions, i.e.\nmuch larger than the distance to the compensation depth, results in the devel\nopment of a compensating root. It is also obvious why the strength (viscosity)\nof the plate enters the equation. If the viscosity is very small, isostatic equilib\nrium can occur even for very small bodies (consider, for example, the floating\niceberg!). Will discuss the relationship between gravity anomalies and topog\nraphy in more (theoretical) detail later. We will also see how viscosity adds a\ntime dependence to the system. Also this is easy to understand intuitively; low\nstrength means that isostatic equilibrium can occur almost instantly (iceberg!),\nbut for higher viscosity the relaxation time is much longer. The flow rate of the\nmaterial beneath the supporting plate determines how quickly this plate can\nassume isostatic equilibrium, and this flow rate is a function of viscosity. For\nlarge viscosity, loading or unloading results in a viscous delay; for instance the\nrebound after deglaciation.\n2.9\nFlexure and gravity.\nThe bending of the lithosphere combined with its large strength is, in fact, one\nof the compensation mechanisms for isostasy. When we discussed isostasy we\nhave seen that the depth to the bottom of the root, which is less dense than\nsurrounding rock at the same depth, can be calculated from Archimedes'\nPrinciple: if crustal material with density ρc replaces denser mantle material\nwith density ρm a mountain range with height h has a compensating root with\nthickness H\nhρc\nH =\n(2.118)\nρm - ρc\nThis type of compensation is also referred to as Airy Isostasy. It does\nnot account for any strength of the plate. However, it is intuitively obvious\nthat the depression H decreases if the strength (or the flexural rigidity) of the\nlithosphere increases. The consideration of lithospheric strength for calculates\nbased on isostasy is important in particular for the loading on not too long a\ntime scale.\nAn elegant and very useful way to quantify the effect of flexure is by consid\nering the flexure due to a periodic load. Let's consider a periodic load due to to\npography h with maximum amplitude h0 and wavelength λ: h = h0 sin(2πx/λ).\nThe corresponding load is then given by\n2πx\nV (x) = ρcgh0 sin\n(2.119)\nλ\nso that the flexure equation becomes\nd4w\n2πx\nD\n+ (ρm - ρc)gh = ρcgh0 sin\n(2.120)\ndx4\nλ\n\n2.9. FLEXURE AND GRAVITY.\nThe solution can be shown to be\nh0 sin 2πx\n2πx\nw(x) =\nλ\n! = w0 sin\n(2.121)\nρm -1 + D\n2π\nλ\nρc\nρc g\nλ\nFrom eq. (2.121) we can see that for very large flexural rigidity (or very large\nelastic thickness of the plate) the denominator will predominate the equation\nand the deflection will become small (w →0 for D →inf); in other words,\nthe load has no effect on the depression. The same is true for short wave\nlengths, i.e. for λ ≪2π(D/ρcg)1/4 . In contrast, for very long wave lengths\n(λ ≫2π(D/ρcg)1/4) or for a very weak (or thin) plate the maximum depression\nbecomes\nρch0\nw0 ≈\n(2.122)\nρm -ρc\nwhich is the same as for a completely compensated mass (see eq. 2.118). In\nother words, the plate \"has no strength\" for long wavelength loads.\nThe importance of this formulation is evident if you realize that any topog\nraphy can be described by a (Fourier) series of periodic functions with different\nwavelengths. One can thus use Fourier Analysis to investigate the depression or\ncompensation of any shape of load.\nEq. (2.121) can be used to find expressions for the influence of flexure on\nthe Free Air and the Bouguer gravity anomaly. The gravity anomalies depend\non the flexural rigidity in very much the same way as the deflection in (2.121).\nFree-air gravity anomaly:\n⎧\n⎫\n⎨\ne-2πbm /λ\n⎬\n2πx\n∆gfa = 2πρcG ⎩ 1 -\n1 +\nD\n2π\n4 ⎭ h0 sin\nλ\n(2.123)\n(ρm -ρc )g\nλ\nBouguer gravity anomaly:\n-2πρcGe-2πbm /λ\n2πx\n\nh0 sin\n(2.124)\n∆gB =\n1 +\nD\n2π\nλ\n(ρm -ρc )g\nλ\nwhere bm is the depth to the Moho (i.e. the depressed interface between ρc and\nρm) and the exponential in the numerator accounts for the fact that this interface\nis at a certain depth (this factor controls, in fact, the downward continuation).\nThe important thing to remember is the linear relationship with the topog\nraphy h and the proportionality with D-1 . One can follow a similar reasoning\nas above to show that for short wavelengths the free air anomaly is large (and\npositive) and that the Bouguer anomaly is almost zero. This can be explained\nby the fact that the flexure is then negligible so that the Bouguer correction suc\ncessfully removes all anomalous structure. However, for long wavelength loads,\nthe load is completely compensated so that after correction to zero elevation,\n\nCHAPTER 2. THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\nthe Bouguer correction still 'feels' the anomalously low density root (which is\nnot corrected for). The Bouguer anomaly is large and negative for a completely\ncompensated load. Complete isostasy means also that there is no net mass\ndifference so that the free air gravity anomaly is very small (practically zero).\nGravity measurements thus contain information about the degree of isostatic\ncompensation.\nThe correlation between the topography and the measured Bouguer anoma\nlies can be modeled by means of eq. (2.124) and this gives information about\nthe flexural rigidity, and thus the (effective!) thickness of the elastic plate. The\ndiagram below gives the Bouguer anomaly as a function of wave length (i.e.\ntopography was subjected to a Fourier transformation). It shows that topog\nraphy with wavelengths less than about 100 km is not compensated (Bouguer\nanomaly is zero). The solid curves are the predictions according to eq. 2.124\nfor different values of the flexural parameter α. The parameters used for these\ntheoretical curves are ρm = 3400 kgm-3 , ρc = 2700 kgm-3 , bm = 30 km,\nα = [4D/(ρm - ρc)g]1/4 = 5, 10, 20, and 50 km. There is considerable scatter\nbut a value for α of about 20 seems to fit the observations quite well, which,\nwith E= 60 GPa and σ= 0.25, gives an effective elastic thickness h ∼ 6 km.\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nλ (km)\n-∆g B / 2πρc Gh0\nα\nα\nα\nα\nUnited States\n= 50 km\n= 20 km\n= 10 km\n= 5 km\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 2.20: Bouguer anomalies and topography.\nPost-glacial rebound and viscosity\nSo far we have looked at the bending or flexure of the elastic lithosphere to\nloading, for instance by sea mounts. To determine the deflection w(x) we used\nthe principle of isostasy. In order for isostasy to work the mantle beneath the\nlithosphere must be able to flow. Conversely, if we know the history of loading,\nor unloading, so if we know the deflection as a function of time w(x, t), we can\n\n2.9. FLEXURE AND GRAVITY.\ninvestigate the flow beneath the lithosphere. The rate of flow is dependent on\nthe viscosity of the mantle material. Viscosity plays a central role in under\nstanding mantle dynamics. Dynamic viscosity can be defined as the ratio of the\napplied (deviatoric) stress and the resultant strain rate; here we mostly consider\nNewtonian viscosity, i.e., a linear relationship between stress and strain rate.\nThe unit of viscosity is Pascal Second [Pa s].\nA classical example of a situation where the history of (un)loading is suffi\nciently well known is that of post-glacial rebound. The concept is simple:\n1. the lithosphere is depressed upon loading of an ice sheet (viscous mantle\nflow away from depression make this possible)\n2. the ice sheet melts at the end of glaciation and the lithosphere starts\nrebound slowly to its original state (mantle flow towards the decreasing\ndepression makes this possible). The uplift is well documented from el\nevated (and dated) shore lines. From the rate of return flow one can\nestimate the value for the viscosity.\nLoad\nSubsidence\nA\nB\nC\nD\nStart of Glaciation\nViscous Mantle\nIce Melts at End\nof Glaciation\nSubsequent Slow\nRebound of Lithosphere\nLoad Causes\nElastic Lithosphere\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nTwo remarks:\n1. the dimension of the load determines to some extend the depth over which\nthe mantle is involved in the return flow → the comparison of rebound\nhistory for different initial load dimensions gives some constraints on the\nvariation of viscosity with depth.\n2.

Also taken into account in recent models is the history of the\nmelting and the retreat of the ice cap itself (including the changes in\nshore line with time!). In older models one only investigated the response\nto instantaneous removal of the load.\nTypical values for the dynamic viscosity in the Earth's mantle are 1019 Pa s\nfor the upper mantle to 1021 Pa s for the lower mantle. The lithosphere is even\n\"stiffer\", with a typical viscosity of about 1024 (for comparison: water at room\ntemperature has a viscosity of about 10-3 Pa s; this seems small but if you've\never dived of a 10 m board you know it's not negligible!)\nThings to remember about these values:\n1. very large viscosity in the entire mantle\n2. lower mantle (probably) more viscous than upper mantle,\n3. the difference is not very large compared to the large value of the viscosity\nitself.\nAn important property of viscosity is that it is temperature dependent; the\nviscosity decreases exponentially with increasing temperature as η = η0e-30T/Tm ,\nwhere Tm is the melting temperature and -30 is an empirical, material dependent\nvalue.\n\n2.9. FLEXURE AND GRAVITY.\nThis temperature dependence of viscosity explains why one gets convection\nbeneath the cooling lithosphere. As we have discussed before, with typical\nvalues for the geothermal gradient (e.g., 20 Kkm-1) as deduced from surface\nheat flow using Fourier's Law the temperature would quickly rise to near the\nsolidus, the temperature where the rock starts to melt. However, we know from\nseveral observations, for instance from the propagation of S- waves, that the\ntemperature is below the solidus in most parts of the mantle (with the possible\nexception in the low velocity zone beneath oceanic and parts of the continental\nlithosphere). So there must be a mechanism that keeps the temperature down,\nor, in other words, that cools the mantle much more efficiently than conduction.\nThat mechanism is convection. We saw above that the viscosity of the litho\nsphere is very high, and upper mantle viscosity is about 5 orders of magnitude\nlower. This is largely due to the temperature dependence of the viscosity (as\nmentioned above): when the temperature gets closer to the solidus (Tm) the\nviscosity drops and the material starts to flow.\noC)\nCraton\nTemperature (\n100 Myr\n25 Myr\n5 Myr\nDry solidus\nDepth (km)\nFigure by MIT OCW."

The geomagnetic field and its variations over time\nare our most direct ways to study the dynamics of the core. The variations\nwith time of the geomagnetic field, the secular variations, are the basis for the\nscience of paleomagnetism, and several major discoveries in the late fifties\ngave important new impulses to the concept of plate tectonics. Magnetism also\nplays a major role in exploration geophysics in the search for ore deposits.\nBecause of its use as a navigation tool, the study of the magnetic field has\na very long history, and probably goes back to the 12thC when it was first\nexploited by the Chinese. It was not until 1600 that William Gilbert postulated\nthat the Earth is, in fact, a gigantic magnet. The origin of the Earth's field has,\nhowever, remained enigmatic for another 300 years after Gilbert's manifesto\n'De Magnete'. It was also known early on that the field was not constant in\ntime, and the secular variation is well recorded so that a very useful historical\nrecord of the variations in strength and, in particular, in direction is available\nfor research. The first (known) map of declination was published by Halley\n(yes, the one of the comet) in 1701 (the 'chart of the lines of equal magnetic\nvariation', also known as the 'Tabula Nautica').\nThe source of the main field and the cause of the secular variation remained\na mystery since the rapid fluctuations seemed to be at odds with the rigidity\nof the Earth, and until early this century an external origin of the field was\nseriously considered. In a breakthrough (1838) Gauss was able to prove that\nalmost the entire field has to be of internal origin. Gauss used spherical\nharmonics and showed that the coefficients of the field expansion, which he\ndetermined by fitting the surface harmonics to the available magnetic data at\nthat time (a small number of magnetic field measurements at intervals of about\n30* along several parallels - lines of constant latitude), were almost identical to\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nthe coefficients for a field due to a magnetized sphere or to a dipole. In fact, he\nalso showed from a spectral analysis that the best fit to the observed field was\nobtained if the dipole was not purely axial but made an angle of about 11* with\nthe Earth's rotation axis.\nAn outstanding issue remained: what causes the internal field? It was clear\nthat the temperatures in the interior of the Earth are probably much too high\nto sustain permanent magnetization. A major leap in the understanding of the\norigin of the field came in the first decade of the twentieth century when Oldham\n(1906) and Gutenberg (1912) demonstrated the existence of a (outer) core with\na very low viscosity since it did not seem to allow shear wave propagation (→\nrigidity μ=0). So the rigidity problem was solved. From the cosmic abundance\nof metallic iron it was inferred that metallic iron could be the major constituent\nof the (outer) core (the seismologist Inge Lehmann discovered the existence of\nthe inner core in 1936). In the 40's Larmor postulated that the magnetic field\n(and its temporal variations) were, in fact, due to the rapid motion of highly\nconductive metallic iron in the liquid outer core. Fine; but there was still the\napparent contradiction that the magnetic field would diffuse away rather quickly\ndue to ohmic dissipation while it was known that very old rocks revealed a rem\nnant magnetic field. In other words, the field has to be sustained by some, at\nthat time, unknown process. This lead to the idea of the geodynamo (Sir\nBullard, 40-ies and 50-ies), which forms the basis for our current understanding\nof the origin of the geomagnetic field. The theory of magneto-hydrodynamics\nthat deals with magnetic fields in moving liquids is difficult and many approxi\nmations and assumptions have to be used to find any meaningful solutions. In\nthe past decades, with the development of powerful computers, rapid progress\nhas been made in understanding the field and the cause of the secular variation.\nWe will see, however, that there are still many outstanding questions.\nDifferences and similarities with Gravity\nSimilarities are:\n- The magnetic and gravity fields are both potential fields, the fields are\nthe gradient of some potential V , and Laplace's and Poisson's equations\napply.\n- For the description and analysis of these fields, spherical harmonics is the\nmost convenient tool, which will be used to illustrate important properties\nof the geomagnetic field.\n- In both cases we will use a reference field to reduce the observations of\nthe field.\n- Both fields are dominated by a simple geometry, but the higher degree\ncomponents are required to get a complete picture of the field. In gravity,\nthe major component of the field is that of a point mass M in the center\nof the Earth; in geomagnetism, we will see that the field is dominated\n\nby that of an axial dipole in the center of the Earth and approximately\naligned along the rotational axis.\nDifferences are:\n- In gravity the attracting mass m is positive; there is no such thing as\nnegative mass. In magnetism, there are positive and negative poles.\nFigure 3.1:\n- In gravity, every mass element dM acts as a monopole; in contrast, in\nmagnetism isolated sources and sinks of the magnetic field H don't exist\n(∇· H = 0) and one must always consider a pair of opposite poles. Oppo\nsite poles attract and like poles repel each other. If the distance d between\nthe poles is (infinitesimally) small → dipole.\n- Gravitational potential (or any potential due to a monopole) falls of as\n1 over r, and the gravitational attraction as 1 over r2 . In contrast, the\npotential due to a dipole falls of as 1 over r2 and the field of a dipole as\n1 over r3 . This follows directly from analysis of the spherical harmonic\nexpansion of the potential and the assumption that magnetic monopoles,\nif they exist at all, are not relevant for geomagnetism (so that the l = 0\ncomponent is zero).\n- The direction and the strength of the magnetic field varies with time\ndue to external and internal processes. As a result, the reference field\nhas to be determined at regular intervals of time (and not only when\nbetter measurements become available as is the case with the International\nGravity Field).\n- The variation of the field with time is documented, i.e. there is a his\ntoric record available to us. Rocks have a 'memory' of the magnetic field\nthrough a process known as magnetization. The then current magnetic\nfield is 'frozen' in a rock if the rock sample cools (for instance, after erup\ntion) beneath the so called Curie temperature, which is different for\ndifferent minerals, but about 500-600*C for the most important minerals\nsuch as magnetite. This is the basis for paleomagnetism. (There is no\nsuch thing as paleogravity!)\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\n3.1\nThe main field\nFrom the measurement of the magnetic field it became clear that the field has\nboth internal and external sources, both of which exhibit a time dependence.\nSpherical harmonics is a very convenient tool to account for both components.\nLet's consider the general expression of the magnetic potential as the superpo\nsition of Legendre polynomials:\ninf\nl\nl+1\n\na\nr\nl\nVm(r, θ, φ) = a\nl\n[gl\nm cos mφ + hm sin mφ]\nP m(cos θ),(3.1)\nl\nr\n′m\nl=1 m=0\na\n[g l cos mφ + h′m sin mφ]\nl\nor, assuming Einstein's summation convention (implicit summation over\nrepeated indices), we can write:\nr l\nVm(r, θ, φ) = a\nIm\n+ Em\nP m(cos θ)\n(3.2)\na l+1\nl\nl\nl\nr\na\nwhere Im and Em are the amplitude factors of the contributions of the internal\nl\nl\nand external sources, respectively. (Note that, in contrast to the gravitational\npotential, the first degree is l = 1, since l = 0 would represent a monopole,\nwhich is not relevant to geomagnetism.)\n3.2\nThe internal field\nThe internal field has two components: [1] the crustal field and [2] the core field.\nThe crustal field\nThe spatial attenuation of the field as 1 over distance cubed means that the\nshort wavelength variations at the Earth's surface must have a shallow source.\nCan not be much deeper than mid crust, since otherwise temperatures are too\nhigh. More is known about the crustal field than about the core field since we\nknow more about the composition and physical parameters such as temperature\nand pressure and about the types of magnetization. Two important types of\nmagnetization:\n- Remanent magnetization (there is a field B even in absence of an am\nbient field). If this persists over time scales of O(108) years, we call this\npermanent magnetization. Rocks can acquire permanent magnetiza\ntion when they cool beneath the Curie temperature (about 500-600* for\nmost relevant minerals). The ambient field then gets frozen in, which is\nvery useful for paleomagnetism.\n- Induced magnetization (no field, unless induced by ambient field).\n\n3.2. THE INTERNAL FIELD\nNo mantle field\nWhy not in the mantle? Firstly, the mantle consists mainly of silicates and the\naverage conductivity is very low. Secondly, as we will see later, fields in a low\nconductivity medium decay very rapidly unless sustained by rapid motion, but\nconvection in the mantle is too slow for that. Thirdly, permanent magnetization\nis out of the question since mantle temperatures are too high (higher than the\nCurie temperature in most of the mantle).\nThe core field\nThe temperatures are too high for permanent magnetization. The field is caused\nby rapid (and complex) electric currents in the liquid outer core, which consists\nmainly of metallic iron. Convection in the core is much more vigorous than in\nthe mantle: about 106 times faster than mantle convection (i.e, of the order of\nabout 10 km/yr).\nOutstanding problems are:\n1. the energy source for the rapid flow. A contribution of radioactive de\ncay of Potassium and, in particular, Uranium, can - at this stage - not\nbe ruled out. However, there seems to be increasing consensus that the\nprimary candidate for providing the driving energy is gravitational energy\nreleased by downwelling of heavy material in a compositional convec\ntion caused by differentiation of the inner core. Solidification of the\ninner core is selective: it takes out the iron and leaves behind in the outer\ncore a relatively light residue that is gravitationally unstable. Upon so\nlidification there is also latent heat release, which helps maintaining an\nadiabatic temperature gradient across the outer core but does not effec\ntively couple to convective flow. The lateral variations in temperature in\nthe outer core are probably very small and the role of thermal convection\nis negligible. Any aspherical variations in density would be annihilated\nquickly by convection as a result of the low viscosity.\n2. the details of the pattern of flow. This is a major focus in studies of the\ngeodynamo.\nThe knowledge about flow in the outer core is also restricted by observational\nlimitations.\n- the spatial attenuation is large since the field falls of as 1 over r3. As a\nconsequence effects of turbulent flow in the core are not observed at the\nsurface. Conversely, the downward continuation of small scale features in\nthe field will be hampered by the amplification of uncertainties and of the\ncrustal field.\n- the mantle has a small but non-zero conductivity, so that rapid variations\nin the core field will be attenuated. In general, only features of length\nscales larger than about 1500 km (l < 12, 13) and on time scales longer\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nthan 1 to 5 year are attributed to core flow, although this rule of thumb\nis ad hoc.\nThe core field has the following characteristics:\n1. 90% of the field at the Earth's surface can be described by a dipole in\nclined at about 11* to the Earth's spin axis. The axis of the dipole in\ntersects the Earth's surface at the so-called geomagnetic poles at about\n(78.5*N, 70*W) (West Greenland) and (75.5*S, 110*E). In theory the an\ngle between the magnetic field lines and the Earth's surface is 90* at the\npoles but owing to local magnetic anomalies in the crust this is not nec\nessarily the case in real life.\nThe dipole field is represented by the degree 1 (l = 1) terms in the har\nmonic expansion. From the spherical harmonic expansion one can see\nimmediately that the potential due to a dipole attenuates as 1 over r2 .\n2. The remaining 10% is known as the non-dipole field and consists of\na quadrupole (l = 2), and octopole (l = 3), etc. We will see that at\nthe core-mantle-boundary the relative contribution of these higher degree\ncomponents is much larger!\nNote that the relative contribution 90%↔10% can change over time as\npart of the secular variation.\n3. The strength of the Earth's magnetic field varies from about 60,000 nT at\nthe magnetic pole to about 25,000 nT at the magnetic equator. (1nT =\n1γ = 10-1 Wb m-2).\n4. Secular variation: important are the westward drift and changes in the\nstrength of the dipole field.\n5. The field is probably not completely independent from the mantle. Core-\nmantle coupling is suggested by several observations (i.e., changes of the\nlength of day, not discussed here), by the statistics of field reversals, and\nby the suggested preferential reversal paths.\n\n3.3. THE EXTERNAL FIELD\nIntermezzo 3.1 Units of confusion\nThe units that are typically used for the different variables in geomagnetism are\nsomewhat confusing, and up to 5 different systems are used. We will mainly use\nthe Syst`\nes (S.I.) and mention the electromagnetic units\neme International d'Unit\n(e.m.u.) in passing. When one talks about the geomagnetic field one often talks\nabout B, measured in T (Tesla) (= kg-1 A-1s-2 ) or nT (nanoTesla) in S.I., or\nGauss in e.m.u. In fact, B is the magnetic induction due to the magnetic field\nH, which is measured in Am-1 in S.I. or Oersted in e.m.u. For the conversions\nfrom the one to the other unit system: T = 104 G(auss) → 1nT = 10-5 G =\n1γ (gamma). B = μ0 H with μ0 the magnetic permeability in free space; μ0 =\n4π×10-7 kgmA-2 s-2 [=NA-2 = H(enry) m-1 ], in S.I., and μ0 = 1 G Oe in\ne.m.u. So, in e.m.u., B = H, hence the liberal use of B for the Earth's field.\nThe magnetic permeability μ is a measure of the \"ease\" with which the field H\ncan penetrate into a material. This is a material property, and we will get back\nto this when we discuss rock magnetism.\nIn the next table, some of the quantities are summarized together with their\nunits and dimensions. There are only 4 so-called dimensions we need. These are\n(with their symbol and standard units) mass [M (kg)], length [L (m)], time\n[T (s)] and current [I (Amp`ere)].\nQuantity\nSymbol\nDimension\nS.I.

Moreover, the typical time scale for changes of the intensity\nof the external field is much shorter than that of the field due to the internal\nsource. Variations in magnetic field due to an external origin (atmospheric,\nsolar wind) are often on much shorter time scales so that they can be separated\nfrom the contributions of the internal sources.\nThe separation is ad hoc but seems to work fine. The rapid variation of the\nexternal field can be used to study the (lateral variation in) conductivity in the\nEarth's mantle, in particular to depth of less than about 1000 km. Owing to\nthe spatial attenuation of the coefficients related to the external field and, in\nparticular, to the fact that the rapid fluctuations can only penetrate to a certain\ndepth (the skin depth, which is inversely proportional to the frequency), it is\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\ndifficult to study the conductivity in the deeper part of the lower mantle.\n3.4\nThe magnetic induction due to a magnetic\ndipole\nMagnetic fields are fairly similar to electric fields, and in the derivation of the\nmagnetic induction due to a magnetic dipole, we can draw important conclusions\nbased on analogies with the electric potential due to an electric dipole. We will\ntherefore start with a brief discussion of electric dipoles.\nOn the other hand, our familiarity with the gravity field should enable us to\ndeduce differences and similarities of the magnetic field and the gravity field as\nwell. In this manner, we will start with the field due to a magnetic dipole -- the\nsimplest configuration in magnetics -- in a straightforward analysis based on\nexperiments, and subsequently extend this to the field induced by higher-order\n\"poles\": quadrupoles, octopoles, and so on. The equivalence with gravitational\npotential theory will follow from the fact that both the gravitational and the\nmagnetic potential are solutions to Laplace's equation.\nThe electric field due to an electric dipole\nThe law obeyed by the force of interaction of point charges q (in vacuum) was\nestablished experimentally in 1785 by Charles de Coulomb. Coulomb's Law\ncan be expressed as:\nq0q\n1 q0q\nF = Ke\nˆr =\nˆ\n(3.3)\nr2\n4πε0 r2 r,\nwhere ˆr is the unit vector on the axis connecting both charges. This equation\nis completely analogous with the gravitational attraction between two masses,\nas we have seen. Just as we defined the gravity field g to be the gravitational\nforce normalized by the test mass, the electric field E is defined as the ratio of\nthe electrostatic force to the test charge:\nF\nE =\n,\n(3.4)\nq0\nor, to be precise,\nF\nE = lim\n,\n(3.5)\nq0 →0 q0\nNow imagine two like charges of opposite sign +p and -p, separated by a\ndistance d, as in Figure 3.2. At a point P in the equatorial plane, the electrical\nfields induced by both charges are equal in magnitude. The resulting field is\nantiparallel with vector m. If we associate a dipole moment vector m with this\n\n3.4.

In gravity we saw that the gravitational field g (the gravitational\nforce per unit mass), led to the gravitational potential at point P due to a mass\nelement dM given by Ugrav = -GdM r-1 . We can use this as an ad hoc analog\nfor the derivation of the potential due to a magnetic dipole, approximated by\na set of imaginary monopoles with strength p. To get an expression for the\nmagnetic potential we have to account for the potential due to the negative\n(-p) and the positive (+p) pole separately.\nWith A some constant we can write\n\n1 - 1\nr-\nVm = A\n1 -\n= Ad\nr+\n(3.7)\nr+\nr-\nd\nand for small d\n∂\n-\n∼\n(3.8)\nd\nr+\nr-\n∂d\nr\neq.

This expression\ncan be written as the directional derivative in the direction of r by projecting\nthe variations in the direction of d on r (i.e., taking the dot product between d\nor m and r):\n\n∂\n∂\n∂d\nr\n= ∂r\nr\ncos θ = - r2 cos θ\n(3.10)\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nIntermezzo 3.2 Magnetic field induced by electrical\ncurrent\nThere is no such thing as a magnetic \"charge\" or \"mass\" or \"monopole\" that\nwould make a magnetic force a law similar to the law of gravitational or electro\nstatic attraction. Rather, the magnetic induction is both defined and measured\nas the force (called the Lorentz forcea) acting on a test charge q0 that travels\nthrough such a field with velocity v.\nF = q0(E + v × B)\n(3.11)\nOn the other hand, it is observed that electrical currents induce a magnetic\nfield, and to describe this, an equation is found which resembles the electric\ninduction to to a dipole. The idea of magnetic dipoles is born. In 1820, the\nFrench physicists Biot and Savart measured the magnetic field induced by an\nelectrical current. Laplace cast their results in the following form:\nμ0 dl × ˆr\ndB(P ) =\ni\n.\n(3.12)\n4π\nr2\nAn infinitesimal contribution to the magnetic induction dB due to a line seg\nment l through which flows a current i is given by the cross product of that\nline segment (taken in the direction of the current flow) and the unit vector\nconnecting the dl to point P .\nFor a point P on the axis of a closed circular current loop with radius R, the\ntotal induced field B can be obtained as:\nμ0 πR2\nμ0 |m|\nB =\ni\n=\n.\n(3.13)\n2π\nr3\n2π r3\nIn analogy with the electrical field, a dipole moment m is associated with the\ncurrent loop. Its magnitude if given as |m| = πR2 i, i.e. the current times the\narea enclosed by the loop. m lies on the axis of the circle and points according\nin the direction a corkscrew moves when turned in the direction of the current\n(the way you find the direction of a cross product). Note how similar Eq. 3.13\nis to Eq. 3.6: the simplest magnetic configuration is that of a dipole.\nThe definition of electric or gravitational potential energy is work done per\nunit charge or mass. In analogy to this, we can define the magnetic potential\nincrement as:\ndV = -B · dl\n⇔\nB = -∇V\n(3.14)\nWhat is the potential at a point P due to a current loop? Using Eq. 3.12, we\ncan write Eq. 3.14 as:\nμ0\ndl′ × ˆr\ndV (P ) = -\ni\n· dl.\n(3.15)\n4π\nr2\nWorking this out (this takes a little bit of math) for a current loop small in\ndiameter with respect to the distance r to the point P and introducing the\nmagnetic dipole moment m as done above, we obtain for the magnetic potential\ndue to a magnetic dipole:\nμ0 m · ˆr\nV (P ) =\n.\n(3.16)\n4π\nr2\naAfter Hendrik A. Lorentz (1853-1928).\n\n3.5. MAGNETIC POTENTIAL DUE TO MORE COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS89\nSince Umonopole ∼ 1/r this expression means that the potential due to a\ndipole is the directional derivative of the potential due to a monopole. (Note\nthat θ is the angle between the dipole axis d and OP (or r) and thus represents\nthe magnetic co-latitude.)\nJust as the Newtonian potential was proportional to GdM , the constant A\nmust be proportional to the strength of the poles, or to the magnitude of the\nmagnetic moment m = |m| →A = Cpd = Cm. We have, in S.I. units,\nμ0m cos θ\nμ0m · r\nμ0 m · ˆr\nVm =\n=\n=\n(3.17)\n4πr2\n4πr3\n4π\nr2\n3.5\nMagnetic potential due to more complex con\nfigurations\nLaplace's equation for the magnetic potential\nIn gravity, the simplest configuration was the gravity field due to a point mass, or\ngravitational monopole. After that we went on and proved how the gravitational\npotential obeyed Laplace's equation. The solutions were found as spherical\nharmonic functions, for which the l = 0 term gave us back the gravitational\nmonopole.\nMagnetic monopoles have not been proven to exist. The simplest geometry\ntherefore is the dipole. If we can prove that the magnetic field obeys Laplace's\nequation as well, we will again be able to obtain spherical harmonic solutions,\nand this time the l = 1 term will give us back the dipole formula of Eq. 3.16.\nIt is easy enough to establish that for a closed surface enclosing a magnetic\ndipole, just as many field lines enter the surface as are leaving. Hence, the\ntotal magnetic flux should be zero. At the north magnetic pole, your test\ndipole will be attracted, whereas at the south pole it will be repelled, and vice\nversa. Remember how this was untrue for the flux of the gravity field: an apple\nfalls toward the Earth regardless if it is at the north, south or any other pole.\nMathematically speaking, in contrast to the gravity field, the magnetic field is\nsolenoidal. We can write:\nΦB =\nB · dS = 0.\n(3.18)\nS\nUsing Gauss's Divergence Theorem just like we did for gravity, we find that\nthe magnetic induction is divergence-free and with Eq. 3.14 we obtain that\nindeed\n∇2V = 0.\n(3.19)\nThis equation is known in magnetics as Gauss's Law; we will encounter it\nagain as a special case of the Maxwell equations. We have previously solved Eq.\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\n3.19.

If this is true, then there exists a vector field A such that\nB ≡∇× A\n(3.22)\nThis follows from the vector identity\n∇ · B = ∇ · (∇ × A) = 0.\n(3.23)\nThis vector field A is a potential field. For a function φ satisfying Laplace's\nequation ∇φ is solenoidal (and also irrotational). An irrotational vector field\nT is one for which the curl vanishes:\n∇ × T = 0.\n(3.24)\nReduction to the dipole potential\nThe potential due to a dipole is obtained from Eq. 3.20 by setting l = 1 and\ntaking the appropriate associated Legendre functions:\nV D\na\n= r2 [g1 cos θ + g1 cos φ sin θ + h1\n1 sin φ sin θ].\n(3.25)\nThis is valid in Earth coordinates, with the z-axis the rotation axis.The\ncoefficients are (g1 , g1 , h1\n1) and they represent one axial (g1 ) and two equatorial\ncomponents of the field. (with g1 taken along the Greenwich meridian). At any\npoint (r, θ, φ) outside the source of the field, i.e, outside the core, the dipole\nfield can be composed as the sum of these three components.\nEarlier, we had obtained Eq. 3.16, which we can write, still in geographical\ncoordinates, as:\nμ0 1\nx\ny\nz\nV =\n.\n(3.26)\n4π r2 mx r + my r + mz r\nLater, we will see how in a special case, we can take the dipole axis to be\nthe z-axis of our coordinate system (geomagnetic coordinates or axial dipole\n\nl\n3.5.

Then, there is no longitudinal variation of the potential, mz is\nthe only nonzero component and the only coefficient needed is g .

It is certainly more convenient to express the field in spherical\ncoordinates.

See Figure 3.4.\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nFigure 3.4:\nGeographic and geomagnetic reference frames\nIt is useful to point out the difference between geocentric (or geographic) and\ngeomagnetic reference frames.\nIn a geomagnetic reference frame, the dipole axis coincides with the z co\nordinate axis. Since the dipole field is axially symmetric, it is now symmetric\naround the z-axis. This implies that there is no longitudinal variation: no φ-\ndependence. The components of the field can be described by zonal spherical\nharmonics -- in the upper hemisphere, field lines are entering the globe, and\nthey are leaving in the lower hemisphere. Only one Gauss coefficient is neces\nsary: G0 or M′ describe the dipole completely (curled letters used for dipole\nz\nreference frame). See Figure 3.5(A).\nIn Figure 3.5(B), the dipole is placed at an angle to the coordinate axis. To\ndescribe the field, we need more than one spherical harmonic: a zonal and a\nsectoral one. Longitudinal φ-variation is introduced: m = 0. We need three\nGauss coefficients to describe the dipole behavior: g1 , g1 and h1\n1. Of course the\n1)2](1/2)\ndipole itself hasn't changed: its magnitude is now [(g1 )2 + (g1 )2 + (h1\n=\n(G0\n1 )2 . Compared to the dipole reference frame, all we have done is a spherical\nharmonic rotation, resulting in a redistribution of the magnitude of the dipole\nover three instead of one Gauss coefficients.\nThe angle the magnetic induction vector makes with the horizontal is called\nthe inclination I. The angle with the geographic North is the declination D.\nIn a dipole reference frame the declination is indentically zero.\nLet's use Eqs. 3.16 and 3.29 to calculate the components of a dipole field in\nthe dipole reference frame for a few special angles.\nμ0 |m| cos θ\nV = 4π\nr2\n,\n(3.30)\n\n3.5.

Up to degree l = 14-15 there\nis a rapid roll-off of the mean square field with degree l . The field is obviously\npredominated by the lower degree terms, and such a so called \"red\" spectrum is,\nof course, consistent with the spherical harmonic expansion for internal sources,\nsee Eq. 3.20. This part of the spectrum is due to the core field. To be more\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nprecise, the core field dominates the spectrum up to degree l = 14-15. At higher\ndegrees the core field is obscured by a flat \"white-ish\" spectrum where the power\nno longer seems to depend on the degree, or, alternatively, the wavelength of\nthe causative anomalies. This part of the spectrum must be due to sources close\nto the observation points; it relates to the crustal field. We will see that this\nfield is important even, or, in particular, when one wants to study the magnetic\nfield at the surface of the outer core, the core mantle boundary (CMB).\n3.7\nDownward continuation\nIn order to study core dynamics or the geodynamo one wants to know what the\nmagnetic field is close to its source, i.e., at the CMB.\nFrom Eq. 3.20, we deduce that\nl+1\na\nVl(r)\n=\nVl(a)\n(3.37)\nr\na l+2\nB = -∇Vl(r)\n=\nBl(a)(l + 1)\n(3.38)\nr\n(3.39)\nSo for the power spectrum, logically,\na 2l+4\nIl(r) = Il(a)\n(3.40)\nr\nwith Il(a) the power at Earth's surface (r = a).\nLet's look at some numbers to illustrate the effect of downward continuation\n(see Table 3.2). Consider the (r.m.s.) field strength at the equator at both the\nEarth's surface (r = a) and at the CMB (r = 0.54a (so that a/r = 1.82) (Use\neq. (3.36)).\nSurface (nT)\ndipole (l=1)\n42,878\nquadrupole (l=2)\n8,145 (19% of dipole)\noctopole (l=3)\n6,079 (14% of dipole)\nCMB (nT)\n258,493\n89,367 (35% of dipole)\n121,392 (47% of dipole)\nTable 3.2: Field strengths at the surface and the core mantle boundary.\nIn other words, if the spectrum of the core field is \"red\" at the Earth's sur\nface, it is more \"pink-ish\" at the CMB because the higher degree components are\npreferentially amplified upon downward continuation. However, the amplitude\nof the higher degree components (the value of the related Gauss coefficients)\nis small and, consequently, the relative uncertainty in these coefficients large.\nUpon downward continuation these uncertainties are -- of course -- also ampli\nfied, so that at the CMB the higher degree components are large but uncertain\nand the observational constraints for them are increasingly weak! We can now\n\n3.8. SECULAR VARIATION\nalso understand why the crustal field poses a problem if one wants to study the\ncore field at the CMB for degrees l > 14: these high degree components will be\nstrongly amplified upon downward continuation and for high harmonic degrees\nthe core field at the CMB will be contaminated with the crustal field!\n3.8\nSecular variation\nSecular variation is loosely used to indicate slow changes with time of the geo\nmagnetic field (declination, inclination, and intensity) that are (probably) due\nto the changing pattern of core flow. The term secular variation is commonly\nused for variations on time scales of 1 year and longer. This means that there is\nsome overlap with the temporal effects of the external field, but in general the\nvariations in external field are much more rapid and much smaller in amplitude\nso that confusion is, in fact, small. From measurements of the components H,\nZ, and E, at regular time intervals one can also determine the time derivatives\n∂tgm\ngm and ∂thm = h m, and, if need be, also the higher order derivatives.\nl = l\nl\nl\nThe values of gm and hm averaged over a particular time interval along with the\nl\nl\ntime derivatives gl\nm and h m determine the International Geomagnetic Reference\nl\nfield (IGRF), which is published in map and tabular form every 5 year or so.\nTemporal variations in the internal field are modeled by expanding the Gauss\ncoefficients in a Taylor series in time about some epoch te, e.g.,\n\ng m\ne (t)\n=\ng m\ne (te) + ∂g\n∂t\n(t - te)\nte\n\n∂2g (t - te)2\n+\n\n+ higher-order terms\n(3.41)\n∂t2\n\n2!\nte\nMost models include only the first two terms on the right-hand side, but\nsometimes it is necessary to include the third derivative term as well, for dis\ntance, in studies of magnetic jerks.\nSimilar to the mean square of the surface field, we can define a mean square\nvalue of the variation in time of the field at degree l:\nm)2\nI l = (l + 1)\n[( g\n+ (h m)2]\n(3.42)\nl\nl\nand the relaxation time τl for the degree l component as\nIl\nτl =\nI l\n(3.43)\nThere are at least three important phenomena:\n1. Change in the strength of the dipole. We can infer that for the dipole,\nthe coefficients g m and h m are all of opposite sign than those of the main\nl\nl\nfield. This indicates a weakening of the dipole field. From the numbers in\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nTable 7.1 of Stacey and eq. (3.43) we deduce that the relaxation time of\nthe dipole is about 1000 years; in other words, the current rate of change\nof the strength of the dipole field is about 8% per 100yr. Note that this\nrepresents a \"snapshot\" of a possibly complex process, and that it does\nnot necessarily mean that we are headed for a field reversal within 1000yr.\n2. Change in orientation of the main field: the orientation of the best fitting\ndipole seems to change with time, but on average, say over intervals of\nseveral tens of thousands of years, it can be represented by the field of\nan axial dipole. For London, in the last 400 year or so the change in\ndeclination and inclination describes a clockwise, cyclic motion which is\nconsistent with a westward drift of the field.\n3. Westward drift of the field. The westward drift is about 0.2*a-1 in some\nregions. Although it forms an obvious component of the secular variation\nin the past 300-400 years, it may not be a fundamental aspect of secular\nvariation for longer periods of time. Also there is a strong regional depen\ndence. It is not observed for the Pacific realm, and it is mainly confined\nto the region between Indonesia and the \"Americas\".\nCause of the secular variation\nThe slow variation of the field with time is most likely due to the reorganization\nof the lines of force in the core, and not to the creation or destruction of field\nlines. The variation of the strength and direction of the dipole field probably\nreflect oscillations in core flow. The westward drift has been attributed to either\nof two mechanisms:\n1. differential rotation between core and the mantle\n2. hydromagnetic wave motion: standing waves in the core that slowly mi\ngrate westward, but without differential motion of material.\nLike many issues in this scientific field, this problem has not been resolved\nand the cause of the secular variations are still under debate.\n3.9\nSource of the internal field: the geodynamo\nIntroduction\nOver the centuries, several mechanisms have been proposed, but it is now the\nconsensus that the core field is caused by rapid and complex flow of highly\nconductive, metallic iron in the outer core. We will not give a full treatment\nof the complex issues involved, but to provide the reader with some baggage\nwith which it is easier to penetrate the literature and to follow discussions and\npresentations.\n\n3.9. SOURCE OF THE INTERNAL FIELD: THE GEODYNAMO\nMaxwell's Equations\nMaxwells Equations describe the production and interrelation of electric and\nmagnetic fields. A few of them we've already seen (in various forms). In this\nsection, we will give Maxwell's Equations in vector form but derive them from\nthe integral forms which were based on experiments.\nTwo results from vector calculus will be used here. The first we already know:\nit is Gauss's theorem or the divergence theorem. It relates the integral\nof the divergence of the field over some closed volume to the flux through the\nsurface that bounds the voume. The divergence measures the sources and sinks\nwithin the volume. If nothing is lost or created within the volume, there will be\nno net flux through its surface!\n∇ · T dV =\nn · T dS\n(3.44)\nˆ\nV\n∂V\nA second important law is Stokes' theorem. This law relates the curl of\na vector field, integrated over some surface, to the line integral of the field over\nthe curve that bounds the surface.\n∇ × T dS =\nT · dl\n(3.45)\nS\n∂S\n1. The magnetic field is solenoidal\nWe have already seen that magnetic field lines begin and end at the mag\nnetic dipole. Magnetic \"charges\" or \"monopoles\" do not exist. Hence,\nall field lines leaving a surface enclosing a dipole, reenter that same sur\nface. There is no magnetic flux (in the absence of currents and outside\nthe source of the magnetic field):\nΦB =\nB · dS = 0\n(3.46)\nRewriting this with Eq. 3.44 gives Maxwell's first law:\n∇ · B = 0\n(3.47)\n2. Electromagnetic induction\nAn empirical law due to Faraday says that changes in the magnetic flux\nthrough a surface induce a current in a wire loop that defines the surface.\nd\nd\nΦB =\nB · dS = -\nE · dl,\n(3.48)\ndt\ndt\nwhich can be rewritten using Eq. 3.45 to give Maxwell's second law:\n∂\n∇ × E = -\nB\n(3.49)\n∂t\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\n3. Displacement current\nWe've seen that a time-dependent magnetic flux induces an electric field.\nThe reverse is also true: a time-dependent electric flux induces a magnetic\nfield. But a current by itself was also responsible for a magnetic field (see\nEq. 3.12). Both effects can be combined into one equation as follows:\nd\nμ0 i + ε0\nΦE\n=\nB · dl\n(3.50)\ndt\nd\nThe term i is the conductive \"regular\" current. The term ε0 dt ΦE , where ε0\nis the permittivity of free space and has units of farads per meter = A2s4kg\nm3, also has the dimensions of a current and is termed \"displacement\"\ncurrent. Instead of current i we will now speak of the current density\nvector J (per unit of surface and perpendicular to the surface) so that\nJ · ds = i. We can also also use the definition of the electric flux\nS\n(analogous to Eq. 3.46) and write the electric displacement vector\nas D = ε0E. Then, again using Stokes' Law (Eq. 3.45) and defining\nB = μ0H, we can write Maxwell's third equation:\n∂\n∇ × H = J +\nD\n(3.51)\n∂t\n4. Electric flux in terms of charge density\nRemember how we obtained the flux of the gravity field in terms of the\nmass density. In contrast, the flux of the magnetic field was for a closed\nsurface enclosing a dipole. For a closed surface enclosing a charge distribu\ntion, the flux through that surface will be related to the electrical charge\ndensity contained in the volume! This is a manifestation of the potential\n(rather than solenoidal) nature of the electric field.\nWe write\nq\nE · dS =\n,\n(3.52)\nS\nε0\nwhich, with the help of Gauss's theorem (Eq. 3.19) transforms easily to\nMaxwell's fourth law:\n∇ · D = ρE\n(3.53)\nIt's interesting to note that, in the absence of conduction or displacement\ncurrent, the magnetic field is both irrotational and solenoidal (divergence\nfree): ∇ × B = 0 and ∇ · B = 0. In that case, there is actually a theorem\nthat says that B should be harmonic, satisfying ∇2B = 0. Hence, the\nMaxwell equations imply Laplace's equation: they are more general.\n\n3.9. SOURCE OF THE INTERNAL FIELD: THE GEODYNAMO\nOhm's Law of Conduction\nA last important law is due to Ohm: it describes the conduction of current\nin an electromagnetic field. Experimentally, it had been verified that a\nforce called the Lorentz force was exerted on a charge moving in an electric\nand magnetic field, according to:\nF = q(E + v × B)\n(3.54)\nThis can be transformed into Ohm's law which is obeyed by all mate\nrials for which the current depends linearly upon the applied potential\ndifference. Here σ is the conductivity, in 1/(Ohm m).\nJ = σ(E + v × B).\n(3.55)\nIntermezzo 3.4 Scalar potential for the magnetic field\nFor a formal derivation of the relationship between the field and the potential\nwe have to consider two of Maxwell's Equations\n∇× H\n=\nJ + ∂tD\n(3.56)\n∇· B\n=\n(3.57)\nwhere H is the magnetic field, B, the induction, J the electric current density\nand ∂tD the electric displacement current density. We will use this in the discus\nsion of the geodynamo, but for the study of the magnetic field outside the core\nwe make the following approximations. Ignoring electromagnetic disturbances\nsuch as lightning, and neglecting the conductivity of Earth's mantle, the region\noutside the Earth's core (and in the atmosphere up to about 50 km) is often\nconsidered an electromagnetic vacuum, with J = 0 and ∂tD = 0, so that the\nmagnetic field is rotation free (∇×H = 0). This means that H is a conservative\nfield in the region of interest and that a scalar potential exists of which H is the\n(negative) gradient (but watch out for normalization constants -- we'll actually\ndefine the potential starting from the magnetic induction B rather than from\nthe field H by saying that B = -∇Vm ), where B = μ0 H. With (3.57) it follows\nthat such a potential potential must satisfy Laplace's equation (∇2Vm = 0 )\nso that we can use spherical harmonics to describe the potential and that we\ncan use up- and downward continuation to study the behavior of the field at\ndifferent positions r from Earth's center.\nThe Magnetic Induction Equation\nIn geomagnetism an important simplification is usually made, known as the\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation: electrons move according\nto Ohm's law (steady state), which means that ∂tD = 0. Now,\n∇ × H = σ(E + μ0v × H)\n(3.58)\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nWe apply the rotation operator to both sides and use the vector rule ∇ ×\n∇ × () = ∇∇ · () -∇2 (). With the help of this and the Maxwell equations, Eq.\n3.58 can be rewritten as:\n∂H\n= ∇× (v × H) +\n∇2H\n(3.59)\n∂t\nμ0σ\nThis rephrasing of Maxwell's equations is probably one of the most impor\ntant equations in dynamo theory, the magnetic induction equation.\nWe\n\ncan recognize identify the two terms on the right hand side as related to flow\n(advection) and one due to diffusion. In other words, the temporal change of\nthe magnetic field is due to the inflow of new material, which induces new field,\nplus the variation of the field when it's left to decay by Ohmic decay.\nIt is interesting to discuss the two end-member cases corresponding to this\nequation, when either of the two terms goes to zero, that is.\n1. Infinite conductivity: the frozen flux\nSuppose that either the flow is very fast (large v) or that the conductivity\nσ is very large (or both) so that the advection term dominates in eq.\n(3.59).\n∂tH = ∇ × (v × H)\n(3.60)\nIt is important to realize that H and v are so-called Eulerian variables:\nthey specify the magnetic and velocity fields at fixed points in space:\nH = H(r, t) and v(r, t). The partial derivative is not connected to a\nphysical body. Now let's consider any area S bounded by a line C. The\nsurface moves about with the velocity field v. Consider the flux integrals\nof both sides of Eq. 3.60:\n∂ H · n dS =\n∇ × (v × H) · n dS\n(3.61)\nS ∂t\nS\nUsing Stokes' theorem and the non-commutativity of the vector product,\nwe obtain:\n∂ H · n dS +\nH · (v × dl) = 0\n(3.62)\nS ∂t\nC\nUsing a relationship known as Reynold's theorem, we can transform Eq.\n3.62 into:\nd\nH · n dS = 0\n(3.63)\ndt\nS\nThis equation is called the frozen-flux equation. For any surface mov\ning through a highly conductive fluid, the magnetix flux ΦB always stays\n\n3.9. SOURCE OF THE INTERNAL FIELD: THE GEODYNAMO\nconstant. Note that the derivative is a material derivative: it describes\nthe variation of the flux through a moving surface while it is moving! The\nfield lines do not move with respect to the flowing material: there is no\nchange in the electromagnetic field within a perfect conductor. This is\none of the fundamental approximations used to make problems in dy\nnamo theory tractable and it underlies many computational and theoret\nical developments in geomagnetism. While it simplifies the very complex\nmagneto-hydrodynamic theory, it is now known that it is probably not\ncorrect. In particular, if one wants to describe effects on a somewhat\nlonger time scale, say longer than several tens of years, one has to account\nfor diffusion. However, for the description of relatively fast processes the\napplication of the \"frozen-flux\" approximation is appropriate.\n2. No flow: diffusion (decay) of the field\nSuppose that either there is no flow (v = 0) or that the conductivity σ\nis very low. In both cases the diffusion term in eq. (3.59) ((μ0σ)-1∇2H)\nwill control the temporal variation in H. Effectively, eq. (3.59) can be\nrewritten as the (vector) diffusion equation\n∂tH = (μ0σ)-1∇2H\n(3.64)\nwhich means that H (=|H|) decays exponentially with time at a rate\n(μ0σ)-1 = τ -1, where τ is the decay time of the field. The decay time τ\nincreases with conductivity σ, but unless we consider a superconductor,\nthe field will decay. For the earth, this case would represent the situation\nthat the main field is due to some primordial field and that no core flow\nis involved. For realistic numbers, the geomagnetic field would cease to\nexist after several tens of thousands of years.\nThis is a very important conclusion, since it means that the magnetic field\nhas to be sustained! because otherwise it dies out relatively quickly (on\nthe geological time scale). This is one of the primary requirements of a\ngeodynamo: it has to sustain itself ! (by means of scenario 2)\nThe diffusion equation also shows that the depth to which the ambient field\ncan penetrate into conducting material is a function of frequency. This is\nan important concept if one wants to use fluctuating fields to constrain\nthe conductivity or if one studies the propagation of changes in core field\nthrough the conducting mantle and crust.\nConsider a magnetic field that varies over time with a certain frequency\nω (in practice we would use a Fourier analysis to look at the different\nfrequencies), diffusing into a half-space with constant conductivity σ. It\nis straightforward to show that a solution of the vector diffusion equation\nis\nH = H0e -z\nδ e i(ωt-z\nδ)\n(3.65)\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nwith\nωσμ0\n\nδ =\n(3.66)\nthe skin depth, the depth at which the amplitude of the field has de\ncreased to 1/e of the original value. The skin depth is large for low fre\nquency signals and/or low conductivity of the half-space. Rapidly fluc\ntuating fields do not penetrate into the material. (I gave the example\nof swimming in still pond: on a winter day you would - probably - not\nconsider to go swimming even on a nice day with a day time temp of, say,\n20*C, whereas you might on a summer day with the same temperature.\nThe point is that the short period fluctuations controled by night-day cy\ncles do not penetrate deep into the water; the temperature of the water\nthat makes you decide whether or not to go for a swim depend more on\nthe long period variations due to the changing seasons.) The rapid fluc\ntuations of the external field are used to study σ in the upper mantle (z\n< 1000 km) and the core field is used to study σ in the lower mantle.\nGeodynamo\nSo we have a large volume of highly conducting liquid (metallic iron) that moves\nrapidly in the Earth's outer core. The basic idea behind the geodynamo is that\nthe rapid motion of part of the liquid in an ambient magnetic field generates a\ncurrent that induces a secondary magnetic field which is largely carried along in\nthe fluid low (\"frozen flux\") and which reinforces the original field. In principle,\nthis concept can be illustrated by Faraday's disk generator.\nExcess of the light constituent in the outer core is released at the inner\ncore boundary by progressive freezing out of the inner core. The resulting\nbuoyancy drives compositional convection in the outer core, and the combination\nof convection and rotation produces the complex motion needed for self-excited\ndynamo action. The rotation effectively stretches the poloidal field into toroidal\nfield lines (the ω-effect). Most geodynamo models require a strong toroidal field,\nabout 0.01 T (or 100 Gauss), even though this field cannot be observed at the\nEarth's surface. These toroidal field lines are warped up or down due to the\nradial convective flow (assuming \"frozen flux\"): as a result of the Coriolis force\nthis results in helical motion, which, in fact, recreates a poloidal component from\na toroidal one (this is know as the α-effect). The rotation controls the motion in\nsuch a way that the dipole field is stronger than any other poloidal component\nand, averaged over a sufficient time, coincides with the Earth's rotation axis.\n\n3.9. SOURCE OF THE INTERNAL FIELD: THE GEODYNAMO\nIntermezzo 3.5 Spheroidal, toroidal, poloidal\nThe following will help understanding the terminology. An arbitrary vector field\nT on the surface of a unit sphere can be represented in terms of three scalar\nfields U , V and W as follows:\nu = ˆ\nr × ∇1 W,\n(3.67)\nrU + ∇1 V - ˆ\nwhere the operator ∇1 is the dimensionless surface gradient on the unit sphere,\nformed by taking the projection of the \"real\" gradient onto the plane tangent\nto the surface.\nA vector field of the form ˆ\nrU + ∇1V is said to be spheroidal (i.e. having both\nradial and tangential components) whereas one of the form -ˆr × ∇1 W is said\nto be toroidal. A toroidal field is purely tangential. It resembles a torus which\nis purely circular about the z-axis of a sphere (i.e., follows lines of latitude).\nThe curl of a toroidal field (its rotation), is, by definition, poloidal. A poloidal\nfield resembles a magnetic multipole which has a component along the z-axis of\na sphere and continues along lines of longitude.\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\n3.10\nCrustal field and rock magnetism\nFrom spherical harmonic analysis it is clear that short wavelength magnetic\nanomalies must have a shallow origin. Within the outer few km of the Earth\nare rocks with minerals that have ferromagnetic properties. The study of these\nrocks and their magnetization has two important applications in geophysics:\n- These rocks distort the magnetic field due to the core and the induced\nlocal field can be used to investigate crustal structures. (Note that we\nhave seen that the downward continuation of the crustal field obscures\nthe higher degree components of the core field at the CMB).\n- Some of these rocks exhibit permanent magnetization (= remanent mag\nnetization with very long, i.e. > 108 yr, relaxation times) and effectively\nprovide an invaluable record of the history of the magnetic field and the\nrelative motion of tectonic units → paleomagnetism.\nBefore discussing paleomagnetism we need to know some of the basics of\nrock magnetism in order to study the local field. In particular:\n- What are the possible sources of magnetization and what are the condi\ntions that result in a strong, stable magnetization?\n- What are the important rock types and minerals?\n- What are the essential aspects of sample preparation before any accurate\npaleomagnetic measurements can be done? (I will discuss this only briefly.)\nThe physics of the magnetization of an assemblage of rocks is not simple.\nTraditionally, the French have played a major role in research of magnetism,\nand L. N eel was awarded a Nobel prize for his pioneering theoretical work on\nrock magnetism.\n3.11\nMagnetization\nStrength of magnetization: permeability and susceptibility\nLet's start from one of Maxwell's equations. Remember that\n∂\n∇ × H = Jmac +\nD,\n(3.68)\n∂t\nwhere H is the magnetic field strength and Jmac and D are the macroscopic\ncurrent and displacement current densities, respectively. Let's forget about the\ndisplacement current density for a moment (like in the magnetohydrodynamic\nassumption). The displacement current is usually spread out over large areas\nand hence D and also ∂ D can be neglected.\n∂t\nIn a vacuum, the only current one needs to worry about is the macroscopic\ncurrent. In real materials (such as rocks), the atoms and molecules that make\n\n3.11. MAGNETIZATION\nup the substance are like little magnetic dipoles with a dipole moment m: a\nhydrogen atom, for instance is little more than the primitive current loop we\nstarted the definition of the magnetic dipole moment with. The magnetization\nof a substance is defined as the volume density of all these little dipole vectors:\nm\n∆V\nM = lim\n.\n(3.69)\n∆V →0 ∆V\nOne can express the density of microscopic molecular currents Jmol through\nthis magnetization vector as follows:\n∇ × M = Jmol.\n(3.70)\nHence we can rewrite Eq. 3.68 with both the macroscopic and microscopic\ncurrent densities as follows (using B = μ0H):\n∇ × B = μ0Jmac + μ0∇ × M,\n(3.71)\nwhich leads to\nB\n∇ ×\n- M = Jmac.\n(3.72)\nμ0\nComparison with Eq. 3.68 shows that the field strength in a material is given\nwith respect to the macroscopic currents as:\nB\nH =\n- M,\n(3.73)\nμ0\nIt is customary to associate the magnetization not with the magnetic induc\ntion, but with the field strength. It is assumed that this relationship exists:\nM = X · H.\n(3.74)\nThe Greek capital letter chi (X) is used for the magnetic susceptibility tensor.\nIt relates the three components of the internal magnetization to the applied field,\nhence it is a second-order tensor (a matrix). This is usually a complex function,\nas X may depend on anything -- temperature, grain size, H, strain and so\non. It can be negative, too. If X is a tensor, then H and M need not be\ncollinear. Usually, the assumption of magnetic isotropy is made, and Eq. 3.74\nis approximated by a scalar relationship:\nM = χH.\n(3.75)\nNow H and M are collinear, but the magnitudes and sense are regulated by\nthe value and sign of χ. Because both H and M have dimensions of the field,\nχ is a dimensionless constant: the magnetic susceptility.\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nSo Eq. 3.73 reduces to\nB\nB\nH =\n=\n.\n(3.76)\nμ0(1 + χ)\nμ0μ\nA quantity μ was defined which is called the relative permeability of the\nsubstance. In vacuum, μ = 1, χ = 0 and M = 0 -- no bound charges exist in\nfree space.\nWhen a magnetic body is placed in an external magnetic field H the density\nof the field lines inside the body depends on the strength of H and on the\nmagnetization M induced by H. Thus, the magnetic susceptibility χ indicates\nthe ease with which a magnetic body can be magnetized in an external field.\nTypes of magnetization\nThe magnetization of a mineral is controlled by intrinsic (i.e., material depen\ndent) magnetic moments of electrons spinning about their axes (spin dipole\nmoments) or the motion of electrons in their orbits about the atomic nuclei\n(orbital dipole moments). There are several types of spin interactions that give\nrise to different magnetic effects. The following is a brief summary.\nRemanent or Induced? (K onigsberger ratio)\nWhen we talk about magnetization, we can broadly identify two types:\n1. Induced magnetization, MI , which occurs only if an ambient field H is\npresent and decays rapidly if this external field is removed. This induced\nfield is very important in ore exploration.\nM\n2. Remanent magnetization, MR , which is the part of initial magnetization\nthat remains after the external field disappears or changes in character.\nR forms the record of the past field and is the type of magnetization\nthat makes paleomagnetism work.\nIn natural rocks, the ratio between the two is known as the K onigsberger\nratio Q\nQ = |MR|\n(3.77)\n|MI |\nRocks with high Q tend to be magnetically stable and are good recorders\nof the ancient geomagnetic field. (I just remark at this stage that the strength\nof |MR | does not only depend on the composition (more precisely the type\nof magnetic minerals) but also on the grain size, and whether the magnetic\nparticles consist of single or multiple grains). Rock types with high Q are most\nof the mafic rocks, such as basalt and gabbro, and also granite. Limestone, for\ninstance, typically has a very small K onigsberger ratio.\n\n3.11. MAGNETIZATION\nExamples of induced magnetization are diamagnetism and paramagnetism.\nThe fields are weak and decay rapidly when the external field is removed (by\nmeans of diffusion).\nDiamagnetism\nAll materials tend to repel the magnetic field lines of force so that the density\nof field lines within the body (∼|Bi|) is smaller than outside (|Bo|):\nBi = μ0(1 + χ)|H| < Bo = μ0|H| ⇒(1 + χ) < 1 ⇒χ < 0\n(3.78)\nThis effect, which is controlled by orbital dipole moments can be explained\nby Lenz's Law, which states that the field produced by a conductor moving\ninto a magnetic field tends to oppose the external field. Here, the induced field\nproduced by the electron orbits tends to oppose the external field. Even though\nall materials are diamagnetic, in some the effect is completely overshadowed by\nmuch stronger effects such as ferrimagnetism.\nDiamagnetism is a weak effect |χ| < 10-6 so that Binduced ≈Bfree space.\nOwing to diffusion, the original state is quickly restored when the external\nfield H would be removed unless the conductivity σ is very large (supercon\nductors) so that the diffusion (which scales as 1/σ, see magnetic induction\nequation) can be neglected.\nParamagnetism\nIntrinsic paramagnetism is relevant for only a small class of materials, but\nmost magnetic minerals are paramagnetic above the curie temperature (see\nbelow). Paramagnetic minerals tend to concentrate the lines of force so that\nthe induced internal field B is larger than the external field H.\nBi = μ0(1 + χ)|H| > Bo = μ0|H| ⇒(1 + χ) > 1 ⇒χ > 0\n(3.79)\nElectrons spin in opposite directions giving rise to spin dipole moments in\nopposite directions. The spins are arranged in pairs so that the net effect of\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nthe magnetic dipoles is zero. However, if the number of orbital electrons is odd\nthere is a small net magnetic moment that can be aligned with the external field.\nThis is known as paramagnetism. Atoms with an even number of electrons tend\nto be diamagnetic and those with an odd number tend to be both paramagnetic\nand diamagnetic. Like diamagnetism, the effect is small: |χ| < 10-4 so that\nBinduced ≈ Bfree space.\nThe susceptibilities of para- and dia- magnetic minerals are virtually inde\npendent of the ambient field (which gives a linear behavior in the above dia\ngrams) but paramagnetism is strongly temperature dependent because thermal\nfluctuations tend to disorient the alignment with the applied field (competition\nbetween thermal energy that tends to destroy alingment and magnetic energy\nthat tends to create it). The Curie Law states that paramagnetic susceptibility\nis inversely proportional to the absolute temperature.\nFerro- and ferri- magnetism\nThis type of magnetism can result in a remanent magnetization which re\nmains even after the ambient field H changes at a later time. The susceptibility\nof ferro- and ferri- magnetic minerals depends strongly on the applied external\nfield, but in general χ ≫ 0. In ferromagnetic minerals the electron spins line\nup spontaneously. Perfect line-up occurs only in a few metals, such as metallic\niron in the Earth's core, and alloys; in other minerals, such as magnetite, the\nline-up is not complete which results in ferrimagnetism.\nWhich minerals are important?\nThe most important rock-forming minerals with magnetic properties are\nmagnetite\nFe3O = Fe 3+Fe2+O4\nhematite\nFe2O = Fe 3+O3 (can be formed from magnetite by oxidation)\nilmenite\nFeTiO3\nThe magnetic properties of these magnetic minerals and the continuous se\nries of solid solutions between them can be conveniently displayed in ternary\ndiagram of the FeO - TiO - Fe2O3 system:\nFe3O = FeO + Fe2O3;\nFeTiO3 = FeO + TiO2;\nulv\nospinel Fe2TiO = FeO + FeTiO3\nThe titanomagnetite solid solution series A from magnetite→ulv ospinel con\nsists of strongly magnetic cubic oxides. The titanohematite series B (from\n\n3.11. MAGNETIZATION\nFerromagnetism\nZero\nFerrimagnetism\nAntiferromagnetism\nSpin-canted\nAntiferromagnetism\nA\nB\nC\nD\nSpontaneous Magnetic Moment\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nilmenite→hematite) consists of weakly magnetic rhombohedral minerals. Some\nimportant properties of the minerals in the ternary diagram are: Curie tem\nperatures decrease from right to left; generally, the susceptibility increases from\nright to left. Even though, for instance, magnetite has a lower susceptibility\nthan, say ulv ospinel , it is more suitable for paleomagnetic studies, because uit\nmaintains its remanence up to much higher temperatures.\nIntermezzo 3.6 Magnetic hysteresis\nWhen a ferromagnetic body (or an assemblage of asymmetric single grains)\nis placed in an ambient field the magnetization will initially increase linearly\nwith the strength of the ambient field. This linear part of the magnetization is\nreversible and the sample will return to its original state when the ambient field\nis removed. The initial susceptibility is then defined as χ = (dM/dH)|\n. If the\nt=0\nexternal field increases in strength saturation will occur, for instance because no\nmore magnetic domains within a rock can be aligned, and the magnetization M\nrotates into the direction of the ambient field H. This part of the process in non\nreversible: if the ambient field is removed, there may be some relaxation (the\nreversible part) but a remanent magnetization MR will remain. If the external\nfield would change directions a hysteresis the magnetization would follow a\nhysteresis curve. The strength of the magnetization depends on grain size and\ntemperature: the larger the single grains and the lower the temperature, the\nwider the hysteresis curve and the stronger (\"harder\") the magnetization. See\nFigure 3.8.\nMagnetic domains and influence of grain size\nIn bulk magnetic material, say, magnetite, the regions of spontaneous magneti\nzation (magnetic domains) are arranged in patterns to form paths of magnetic\n\nCHAPTER 3.

This\nis known as the demagnetized state. The size of the single domains in such ag\nglomerates depends on susceptibility and are larger in hematite than in, say, the\ntitanomagnetites (see below). When placed in an ambient field H the bound\naries between the domains may migrate in such a way as to enlarge the domains\nthat are favorably oriented with respect to the external field, and this may cause\nmagnetic remanence. The process of cell boundary migration is (energetically\nspeaking) an easier process than the realignment of the direction of magneti\nzation and, as a consequence, large multidomain grains are magnetically \"soft\"\n(i.e. not stable over long periods of time and sensitive to later changes in the\norientation and strength of the ambient field).\nIn contrast, single domain grains have the same direction of spontaneous\nmagnetization throughout, and if they are not in contact with neighboring grains\nthey cannot form closed loops and they can more easily be magnetized to sat\nuration.\nAt high temperatures (or for very small single grains) the kinetic energy, or\nthe thermal agitation, of the system can be too large for any kind of cooperative\n\n3.11.

In\nthis state the rocks are paramagnetic, and magnetization can only be induced\nby an external field. If the assemblage is given a magnetization at time t0 the\n(induced) magnetization decays a e-t/τ0 where τ0, the relaxation time, varies\ndirectly as grain volume (d3) and inversely as temperature T . In other words,\nthe relaxation time becomes shorter exponentially with increasing temperature.\nWhen the relaxation time τ0 is very large (say 108 year) the remanence is said\nto be permanent. The dependence of the relaxation time on temperature and\nthe grain size of single grain particles can be illustrated schematically:\nWhen the rock sample cools, the relaxation time and the susceptibility\n(Curie's Law) increase (the width of the hysteresis curve increases) and there\ncomes a point, at T = Tc, the Curie temperature (after Pierre Curie), at which\nthe thermal agitation is no longer large enough to prevent alignment of the mag\nnetic moments. At this point the assemblage of grains acquires a magnetization\nin the direction of the ambient field, which upon further cooling becomes frozen\nin. This is known as ThermoRemanent Magnetization (TRM).\nThe transition from a state of paramagnetism to TRM is not instantaneous\nand typically occurs over a certain temperature range. The process of acquir\ning TRM consists of a series of partial thermo remanent magnetizations, each\n\n- -\n- -\n-\n- -\n-\n- - - -\n- - - -\nCHAPTER 3.

Reheating to T1 would not de\nstroy that part of the remanent magnetization, but reheating to T2 would. This,\nin fact, underlies the principle of thermal cleaning. For most rocks containing\na single, magnetic constituent the partial TRM acquired at about 50* below the\nCurie point is dominant. If the assemblage consists of a series of minerals with\ndifferent Curie points the initial remanence can easily be overprinted with sec\nondary components reflecting the field direction at some later time. For several\nminerals along the solid solution lines, the ternary system described above gives\nvalues of the Curie temperature Tc above which ferro- or ferri- magnetism is\nnot possible. In general the Curie temperature decreases from right to left, i.e.,\nhematite to ilmenite and from magnetite to ulv ospinel. For hematite Tc=680* ,\nfor magnetite Tc=580*, and for metallic iron (core!) Tc=770* .\nIt is important to realize that the strongly magnetic minerals do thus not\nnecessary result in a strong and stable (= long lasting) magnetization since their\nCurie temperatures can be so small that the original magnetization can easily\n\n3.12. OTHER TYPES OF MAGNETIZATION\nFigure 3.10: Temperature dependence of Curie temperature.\nbe altered during later thermal events (for some magnetic minerals this can\nhappen at room temperature). Conversely, the weakly magnetic minerals may,\nin fact, produce very stable magnetization. Weak and strong refers to the value\n(small, large) of the magnetic susceptibility; stability refers to the time scales\nover which the magnetization can last, and this is more a function of grain size\nand the composition-dependent Curie and blocking temperatures.\n3.12\nOther types of magnetization\nTRM - ThermoRemanent Magnetization\nIn terms of later overprints, it is good to realize that the direction of TRM\ncan be reset if the temperature is raised to above the relevant Curie temper\nature during some later thermal event. Upon cooling a new TRM is frozen\nin. Often, however, reheating will also reset the dating clocks since the closure\ntemperatures for minerals typically used for radio-isotope dating are often lower\nthan the Curie temperatures for the iron oxides. (This is generally true for the\nminerals involved in K-Ar and Rb-Sr dating - hornblende (530*), muscovite\n(350*), biotite (280*), apatite (∼350*), but U-Pb dating is more borderline\nwith the closure temperatures for several important minerals exceeding 600* ,\nfor instance Zircon at 750*). As a consequence, the data can still be used for\npaleomagnetism; the magnetization just relates to a later thermal event.\nDRM - Detrital Remanent Magnetization\nWhen igneous rock is eroded and the magnetic constituent is deposited in\nsufficiently still water the magnetic grains that carry TRM from previous events\nmay become aligned in the ambient field. Since this type of magnetization is\nin fact based on previous TRM it can be a stable and 'strong' magnetization\nwhich can be useful, provided that the time of deposition can be determined\naccurately. There are, however, several complications, for instance, the change\nin any lineation direction due to compaction may result in an underestimation\nif the inclination I and this would underestimate the paleolatitudes.\n\nCHAPTER 3.

For instance, magnetite may oxi\ndize to hematite which then can settle as cement in the matrix between the\ngrains. Conversely, magnetite may be formed from hematite in a reducing en\nvironment. Upon the chemical reactions and renewed deposition the minerals\nare re-magnetized in the then ambient field. In these examples the CRM is\nvery strong. Since the acquisition of CRM does not involve any reheating up to\nthe Curie temperature (which is typically above the blocking temperature for\nradioisotope dating!) it is not possible to put a time tag on and it can not be\nused for paleomagnetism.\nIRM = Isothermal Remanent Magnetization\nExposure of a magnetized sample to very strong field even without increasing\nthe temperature (for long enough time) can result in the re-arrangement of part\nof the initial TRM. IRM is characterized by a very narrow hysteresis curve so\nthat the magnetization is relatively \"weak\". An important source for IRM are\nlightning strikes.\nVRM - Viscous Remanent Magnetization\nResults from the slight reorganization of the magnetic moment in some grains\nif the grain is exposed to an ambient field for a very long time. The external\nfield can \"diffuse\" into the sample, in particular if both μ and χ are large.\n3.13\nMagnetic cleaning procedures\nFor paleomagnetic purposes, the overprints by the other types of magnetization\nare thus a nuisance; if the secondary remanence is \"soft\" their effects can be\n\n3.14. PALEOMAGNETISM\nremoved by techniques collectively known as \"magnetic cleaning\". Cleaning is\nbased on the principle that the soft components are destroyed while the strong\noriginal TRM or DRM is preserved. This can not always be guaranteed and, as\na result, the intensity of the field after cleaning may be unreliable.\n- Alternating field cleaning (a.f. cleaning). Makes use of hysteresis prop\nerties of ferro- and ferri- magnetic minerals. The strength of a particular\nmagnetization is determined by the width of the hysteresis curve, which\nrepresents the field of opposed direction that would have to be applied to\nreduce the remanence to zero. The field is often referred to as the coer\ncive force Hc (see hysteresis curve). In a.f. cleaning one exposes the field\nsample to an alternating field with diminishing strength and the sample\nis rotated in all directions. This process wipes out all components with a\nstrength Hc that is less than the maximum field applied. Of course, this\nonly works if the primary component is stronger than that! This process\nmust be performed in a laboratory set up where one compensated for the\nexternal Earth field in order to avoid remagnitization along HE .\n- Thermal cleaning. Makes use of Curie's law and Curie temperatures. The\nfield sample is heated to a particular temperature to destroy magnetization\nof minerals with Curie temperatures smaller than that value. This is, of\ncourse, only useful if the component you're interested in has a higher Curie\ntemperature than the temperature that is applied.\n- Chemical cleaning: leaching or dissolving certain components of the rock,\nsuch a the hematite rich matrix in a sand stone.\nIn general, one applies progressively stronger cleaning agents to the sample\nuntil the remaining field is stable and no longer changes in direction. The\nintensity of the original TRM/DRM will be obscured in the process!\n3.14\nPaleomagnetism\nA primary objective of paleomagnetism is to determine the history of the ge\nomagnetic field (for a variety of purposes!) and what is needed is (1) \"hard\"\n(+stable) magnetization and (2) information about the time at which that mag\nnetization was acquired. So, of the above mechanisms only TRM and DRM are\nuseful since they have hard magnetization and the timing of acquisition of the\nRMs can be determined (radio-isotope dating and stratigraphy, respectively).\nField practice: orientation of the sample\nOne of the primary objectives is the measurement of the inclination and dec\nlination. One has to know where these angles - measured in a lab - refer to.\nBefore the rock sample is taken from the field one, therefore, has to make sure\nthat its orientation in space at the sample site is known exactly. The current\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nNorth direction must be marked on the sample, and also the horizontal level.\nIf it is clear that the sample is taken from a rock setting that has been de\nformed one must also mark the relation between the reference horizontal and\nthe original horizontal, or the orientation of the stratification (in sedimentary\nrocks). For example, if a sample is taken from marine strata that have been\nfolded, one must measure the dip of the bedding plane. One must then also\napply techniques that are well developed in structural geology to correct for the\nlater deformation and retrieve the original inclination.\nFigure 3.12: Paleomagnetic orientations.\nIdeally, many samples are taken in a sedimentary or volcanic sequence so that\nthe measurements represent, in fact, a time span of several thousands of years.\nIn this way the effects of secular variation can be averaged out and one can apply\nthe so called \"axial dipole assumption\", see below. Core drilling perpendicular\nto the stratification is an effective way to do that, but the original azimuth\nrequired to determine the declination may not be preserved, for instance in a\ncore of a deep marine sediment, so that only the inclination can be used.\nPresentation of inclination and declination\nThe angular information can be used in two ways.\n- Bauer plots: these are plots (named after Bauer) of the angle of inclination\nvs. declination. We have used them to illustrate the secular variation for\nLondon.\n- Virtual Geomagnetic Pole (VGP) plots.\nFrom the measured inclination I and declination D we can calculate (1)\nthe magnetic co-latitude (i.e., the angular distance from the paleo-pole to\nthe sampling site) and (2) the position of the paleomagnetic pole and the\nvirtual (or apparent) geomagnetic pole (VGP). Let's see how we can do\nthat.\nFrom the derivation of the potential of an axial dipole we know that the\nmagnetic co-latitude θm can be calculated from the basic equation for paleo\n\n3.14.

We can also calculate the\nlocation of the pole by measuring out the angular distance θm in the direction\nof D from North.\nThis can be done by means of stereographic projections, but we can also use\nthe sine and cosine rules on a sphere (see Intermezzo).\n\nCHAPTER 3.

The pole determined from a single site is called\nthe Virtual Geomagnetic Pole (VGP). An important result from paleomag\nnetism is that the non-dipole field almost completely averages out over extended\nperiods of time (10,000 yr +) and that the average of all the VGPs from rocks\nof about the same age cluster together about the rotation pole. The is summa\nrized in the Axial Dipole Assumption: if we consider sufficiently long time\nintervals the average VGP represents the paleopole or the paleogeographic\npole.\nIt was soon realized that the paleogeographic poles did not coincide with the\ncurrent rotation pole and that the poles determined from samples of a different\nage do not necessarily overlap. This was initially interpreted as evidence that\nthe poles must move, hence the (obsolete) name Polar Wander. We now know\nthat the poles are fixed and that the pole paths describe the relative motion of\nthe landmass relative to the pole. A rotation of both the pole and the sample\nsite (continent) about a rotation pole at the present-day equator at and angle\nof 90* from (φp,θp) gives the situation at the time of magnetization (assuming\nnormal direction of the field). For each separate tectonic unit, measurements\nfrom samples that are magnetized at different times determines give a series of\nVGPs which define a pole path , or apparent polar wander (APW) path.\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nFigure 3.16:\nNote that on VGP diagrams one plots the VGP position relative to a fixed\nlandmass but in reality the poles are the same and the landmass moves!\nThe observation that the pole paths do not agree for different continents\ndemonstrates that the continents must have moved relative to one another →\nplate tectonic motion. Conversely, the difference in pole paths can be used\nto reconstruct these movements, and this is one of the basic principles of plate\nreconstruction.\nAmbiguities in determination of VGPs and in reconstruct\ning past plate motion\nThe position of the VGP can thus be determined from measurements of the\ninclination and declination. There are, however, two important ambiguities.\n1. The position of the VGP (φp,θp) is invariant for variation in longitude of\nthe sample site. The landmass can be anywhere along a small circle at\nan angular distance of θm about the paleopole. Since many earth systems\n(for instance, climate) exhibit a high degree of rotational symmetry and,\nthus, primarily zonal variation, this ambiguity is difficult to solve.\n2. The declination in the sense used above is poorly defined. In addition to\nrotation about the paleopole (which does not effect the calculation of the\nVGPs) the sample site may have been subject to rotation around a vertical\naxis nearby or through the land mass. In the latter case the uncertainty in\nImage removed due to copyright concerns.\nSee paleogeographic map on the book:\nStacey, F. D. Physics of the Earth. 3rd ed.\nBrisbane: Brookfield Press, 1992.

The same applies to data from drill\ncores since one does not know the declination.\nOnce the paleopole is known from many observations, this ambiguity disap\npears, and from the known pole one can determine the magnetic (co-)latitude,\nor, in other words, the N-S motion of the sample site and the relative rotation\nabout any axis other than the paleopole.\n3.15\nField Reversals\nFor Earth, a reversal can be defined as a globally observed change in sign of\nthe gaussian coefficient g0\n1 that is stable over long (> 5kyr) periods of time.\nWhat's the relevance of studying field reversals?\n- The alternating fields are recorded as magnetic anomalies in newly created\nocean floor. This provides us with a fantastic dating device (the magnetic\nreversal time scale) and a very powerful tool to track past plate motions.\n- It may give us important clues and constraints for our understanding of\ncore dynamics, the very origin of the main field, and the possible mecha\nnisms of core-mantle coupling.\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\n- The magnetic field creates a protective shield for radiation from space\n(solar wind, for instance) and changes in intensity of the field may also\nchange the effectiveness of this protection. Major events in the evolution\nary process have been linked to variations in paleo-intensity.\nBelts\nMagnetopause\nMagnetosheath\nMagnetic Equator\nE\nVan Allen\nBow Shock\nSolar Wind\nEarth Radii\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure 3.18: The magnetosphere.\n- For navigation purposes it is important to know what's going on with the\nfield, for instance whether it is going through a more rapid-than-average\nchange.\nDiscovery of field reversals: a historical note\nTRM was well known in the 19th century. Evidence for field reversals was first\nreported in 1906 when the French physicist Bernard Brunhes discovered that\nthe direction of magnetization in a lava flow and the adjacent baked clay was\nopposite of that of the current main field. Brunhes concluded that the field\nmust have reversed, but that explanation was not generally accepted. Recall\nthat at that time the origin of the main field was still a mystery. In fact, it was\nin the same year 1906 that Oldham demonstrated the existence of a liquid core\nfrom seismological observations, and that discovery triggered the development\n\n3.15. FIELD REVERSALS\nof geodynamo theory as we now know it. Later, in 1929 Matuyama published\nsimilar observations as Brunhes, but these also attracted little attention. This\ncontinued until well into the 50ies, by which time there was ample observational\nevidence for field reversals.\nHowever, the necessity for field reversals was debated and a major proponent\nof an alternative explanation was the French physicist N eel who showed that\nunder certain conditions ferri-magnetic minerals could, in principle, be self-\nreversing. Self-reversal can happen in a situation where you have a solid solution\nof magnetic minerals (or two at least) with different Curie temperatures (think\nof the hematite-ilmenite series). Then, when the sample cools the mineral with\nthe highest Curie temperature, say mineral A, freezes in the ambient main field\nwhile the minerals with lower Curie temperatures are still in paramagnetic state.\nIf these paramagnetic minerals are very close to mineral A, the remanent field of\nA can induce a field in the other minerals that may be opposite of the direction\nof the main field. This secondary field becomes frozen in when mineral B cools\nbelow its own Curie temperature, etc. etc. In case the mineral with the lower\nCurie temperature has a larger susceptibility (and this is indeed the case for\nthe minerals along the solid solution lines in the ternary diagram!) the reversed\nfield may dominate the combination of the ambient field and the induced field\nin mineral A, and the net effect would be opposite in direction of the main field\nwithout requiring a reversal of that main field. Even though it has been shown\nexperimentally that self-reversal is possible, it requires very special physical\nconditions and it is NOT a plausible mechanism to explain the by then (mid\n50-ies) overwhelming evidence that reversals are quite common.\nStudy of baked clays (or thermal aureoles of igneous bodies in general) at\nmany sites world wide demonstrated that the direction of magnetization in the\nigneous body of the same age and the contact aureole were often the same but\ndid not coincide with that of the adjacent non-metamorphosed rocks. It was\nfound that the rocks showing reversals grouped in specific age intervals, and this\nargument became even more convincing when accurate radiometric techniques\nsuch as K-Ar dating were applied. The reversals appeared to be rather global\nphenomena and could be traced in volcanic rocks as well as in marine sediments.\nThere appeared to be no chemical difference between the rocks the exhibited\nnormal and reversed orientations.\nBy the time of the early 60-ies several important discoveries associated with\nsea floor spreading resulted in the general acceptance of field reversals.\nOutstanding questions\n1. What happens to the dipolar field during reversals? Does the dipole field\ndecay to almost zero before it is regenerated in the opposite direction, or\nis the dipole field perhaps weakened but still prominent during reversals?\nThe measurement of paleointensity of the main field is difficult and prone\nto large uncertainties (see also notes on \"magnetic cleaning\"). Yet, it is\nnow well established that during reversals the intensity of the field reduces\nby at least a factor of 3. Recall that in the present-day field the dipole\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nmakes up for about 90% of the field and that the non-dipole component\nis only about 10% . So although the field reduces to about 30% of its\noriginal strength, the dipolar component cannot be neglected during re\nversals. These numbers are, however, not yet well constrained. Some data\n(and numerical models) suggest a reduction during reversal to about 10%\nof the original strength, which would either imply that the dipole com\nponent has become negligible or that if there still is a dipolar field also\nthe non-dipole components must significantly reduce in strength. The ob\nservational evidence is problematic because [1] the non-dipole field at the\nsurface is so much weaker than it is at the CMB and [2] because a reversal\nis a relatively short phenomenon (say 5,000 yr) and it is hard to get the\ntime resolution in volcanic or sedimentary strata.\n2. A closely related question is: can a non-dipole field produce continuous\nVGP paths during reversals? Are VGP paths random or are there are\npreferred longitudes along which the VGPs move from the one pole to the\nother, and what are the implications of the answer to this question for our\nunderstanding of core dynamics and core-mantle coupling?\nMechanisms of reversals\nThe mechanisms of field reversals are still subject of spirited debate, but it is\ngenerally accepted that they are controlled by core dynamics. Some important\nconstraints (and, indeed, the need for core-mantle coupling) can be inferred\ndirectly from general properties of the geodynamo and from studying the (sta\ntistical) behavior of the field during and in between reversals.\n1. It is important to realize that the geodynamo does not care about the\nsense of the field. The magnetic induction equation ∂H/∂t = ∇× (v ×\nH) + (4μ0σ)-1∇2H is invariant to a change in sign of H.\nWe have argued before that in the core we can largely ignore the diffusion\nterm, and it is clear that the (sign) of the changes in magnetic field depend\nentirely on how the turbulent flow field v interacts with the magnetic field\nH.\n2. The typical relaxation time of core processes is much longer than the time\ninterval in which most reversals take place. If the field is not sustained by\ndynamo action, for instance if the velocity v in the above equation goes\nto zero, the field will die out in several 104 years. The rate of reversals\nmust mean that the core field is actively destructed and regenerated. Part\nof dynamo theory is the complex interaction of and conversion between\nthe poloidal and (unseen) toroidal field. Differential (radius dependent)\nrotation in the outer core stretches the poloidal field into a toroidal field;\nradial flow owing to compositional convection distorts the purely toroidal\nfield (and the coriolis force adds extra complexity in the form of helical\nmotion) which gives a component along the poloidal field. It is conceivable\n\n3.15. FIELD REVERSALS\nthat turbulence produces local changes in the direction of the helicity of\nthe toroidal field and thus the poloidal component, which may trigger a\nreversal.\n3. Reversals are not simply extreme cases of secular variation even though\nthe distinction is vague. Growth, decay, and drift of the non-dipole field\nand of the axial dipole are continuous, albeit possibly random, processes.\nReversals, however, occur over time scales that are longer than the typ\nical secular variations, but much shorter than the average time interval\nbetween reversals (> 105 yr). In other words, statistically speaking rever\nsals do not occur as frequently as one might expect from the continuous\n(secular) fluctuations of the main field. It resembles a chaotic system that\nswitches back and forth between two quasi-stable states. This behavior\nis nicely illustrated by measurements of the inclination, declination, and\nintensity during a reversal that characterizes the lower boundary of the\nJaromillo event (a short N event in the Reversed Matuyama epoch docu\nmented near a Creek in Jaromillo, Mexico:\n-90\n0.01\n0.1\n9.5\n9.0\n10.0\n-60\n-30\n-1 )\n-2\n\nDepth (metres)\nInclination (degrees)\nIntensity (Am\nRelative Age (thousands of years)\nFigure 3.20.

THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\n3.16\nQualitative arguments that explain the need\nfor core-mantle coupling\nThere are compelling reasons to believe that the mantle and the dynamic pro\ncesses in the mantle have a strong influence on reversals (and thus perhaps on\ncore dynamics in general). It is probable that core flow is too turbulent and\nchaotic to be able to organize systematic patterns in field reversals. Reversals\nseem to be a random process in the sense that [1] N and R directions of the\nEarth's magnetic moment occur equally often and [2] the probability that a\nreversal happens in the next ∆t years is independent of the time since the last\nreversal. However, as mentioned above, the average time interval between re\nversals is much larger than expected from the continuous fluctuations in the\nfield. Moreover, in the last 5 year several papers have been published that pre\nsented evidence for preferred reversal paths of VGPs along meridians through\nthe 'Americas' and through east Asia. The selection of the same VGP path over\nand over again seems to require that the core has some 'memory' about what\nhappened many thousands of years ago, which is not very likely.\nIn contrast, the mantle, with its high viscosity has such 'memory' since\nthe mantle structure does not change much over periods that are smaller than\n1 Myr. For this reason, investigators have invoked a strong influence of (or\ncoupling with) the mantle. This coupling could be mechanical (topography on\ncore mantle boundary) but that is not very likely. Alternatively, the coupling\ncould be electro-magnetical; in this mechanism flux out of the core would be\nconcentrated in regions where the conductivity of the lowermost mantle is lowest\n(see dynamo equation above!) and swept away from regions of high conductivity.\nSeveral investigators have related the patches of high and low mantle con\nductivity to lateral variation in the thickness of the so called D\" layer and this\nstructure is likely to be influenced by flow in the entire mantle. This depicts a\ncomplex system where mantle convection controls the lateral variation in thick\nness of the D\" layer (thin beneath major downwellings (slabs) - Americas and\neast Asia - and thicker beneath upwellings - plumes (central Pacific, Hawaii))\nand thus - if D\" is anomalously conductive - lateral variation in mantle conduc\ntivity that produces torques on the core and creates 'windows' for flux bundles\nfrom the core into the mantle. The research in this exciting field is very much\nongoing and no conclusive models has been developed yet.\n3.17\nReversals: time scale, sea floor spreading,\nmagnetic anomalies\nWe have talked in some detail about the implications of the reversals of the\nmagnetic field for our understanding of core dynamics and core-mantle cou\npling. This is a field of active research: rapid progress is being made, but many\noutstanding questions remain to be answered. About 30-35 years ago (first half\nof the 60-ies) the reversals of the main field played a central role in the devel\n\n3.17. REVERSALS: TIME SCALE, SEA FLOOR SPREADING, MAGNETIC ANOMALIES129\nopment of the concept of sea floor spreading, which resulted in the acceptance\nof plate tectonics.\nTo appreciate the line of thoughts it is good to realize that by the end of\nthe 50-ies there was no agreement on the issue of field reversals, even though\nan increasing number of scientists had accepted the idea. At the same time,\ncontinental drift was still hotly debated. Since the idea was first clearly postu\nlated by Alfred Wegener in 1912 it had been advocated by many scientists, for\nexample the South African DuToit, but, in particular, in the US the concept\nmet with continued resistance. A central issue was the driving force and the\nmechanism of continental drift; one did not believe it possible that continents\nwould plow their way through the mafic and strong oceanic lithosphere.\n1. Initially, the evidence for reversals was mainly based on land samples\nof volcanic rocks. It was recognized that rocks with the same magnetic\npolarity grouped into distinct time intervals, and the boundaries of these\ntime windows could be dated accurately with radiometric methods. The\nfirst Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) was based on K-Ar and\n40Ar/39Ar dating of rocks less than 5 Ma old. Based on the first time\nscales one defined epochs as relatively long periods of time of mostly\none polarity, and events as relatively short excursions or reversals of the\nfield within the epochs. The first (= most recent) epochs are named after\nsome of the pioneers in geomagnetism (Brunhes, Matuyama, Gauss, and\nGilbert); events are typically named after the location where it was either\nfirst discovered or where it is best represented (Jaromilla creek, Mexico;\nOlduvai gorge, Tanzania). The current epoch is referred to as \"normal\" (or\n'negative' since the magnetic moment direction is opposite of the angular\nmoment direction). As more data became available the time tables were\nrefined and it became clear that the distinction between epochs and events\nis not so useful.\n2. In the early 60-ies, marine expeditions and geomagnetic surveys resulted\nin the first detailed maps of magnetic anomalies at the ocean floor. A\n\"stripe\" pattern formed by alternating strength of the magnetic field (the\nanomalies were made visible after subtracting the values of the reference\nfield (IGRF)) was documented for the Pacific sea floor off the coast of\nOregon, Washington, and British Columbia (Raff & Mason, 1961), and for\nthe Atlantic just south of Iceland. The origin of this pattern was, however,\nnot known. Explanations included the lateral variation in susceptibility\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nowing to variations in composition or changes in stress due to buckling\n('folding') of the oceanic lithosphere (it was known since the large 1906\nearthquake in San Francisco that changes in the stress field can influence\nmagnetization).\n3. At about the same time, Dietz (1961) and Hess (1962) postulated the\nconcept of sea floor spreading. Not as an explanation for the magnetic\nanomalies, but rather as a way out of the long standing problem that\ncontinental drift seemed unlikely because continents cannot move through\nthe oceanic lithosphere. Dietz and Hess realized that the oldest parts of\noceanic sea floor were less than about 200 Ma old, which is more than an\norder of magnitude less than the age of the oldest continental rocks. This\nsuggests that oceanic lithosphere is being recycled more efficiently than\ncontinental material. These scientists proposed that sea floor is generated\nat mid oceanic ridges (where pillow lavas had been dredged and high heat\nflow measured) and then spreads away carrying the continents with them.\nSo the continents move along with the ocean floor, not through it!!\nIn 1963 Vine and Matthews and, independently, Morley, put these ideas\nand developments (1-3) together and correctly interpreted the magnetic\nanomalies at the sea floor: new ocean floor is created at mid oceanic ridges\n→ the basalt cools below the curie temperature and freezes in the direction\nImage removed due to copyright concerns.\nSee Figure 3.7 on Geol. Soc. Am. Bull. 72 (1961): 1267-1270.\n\n3.18. MAGNETIC ANOMALY PROFILES\nof the then current magnetic field (normal (N) or reversed (R)) → the N-R\npattern spreads away from the ridge. In this way the ocean floor acts as\na tape recorder of the polarity of the Earth's magnetic field in the past.\nInitially, the time table based on land volcanics was correlated with the\nstripe pattern in the oceans, but this correlation was restricted to the\npast 5 Ma. Later, paleontological data (the fossil record) was used (along\nwith radiometric calibration of land volcanics)) to extend the reversal time\nscale to ocean floor of Jurassic age (∼160 Ma). This was first done in the\nsouth Atlantic where the time scale was extended to 80 Ma by assuming\nthat the rate of sea floor spreading was constant in that time interval,\nan assumption that was later justified). With the increasing amount of\ndata, the time scale is continually being updated. The time scale is very\nimportant for two main reasons:\n- Using the GPTS allows the calculation of sea floor spreading rates\nby measuring the distance between identified lineations.\n- Identification of the magnetic pattern of the sea floor and matching\nwith the time scale can be used to date a piece of oceanic crust.\n3.18\nMagnetic anomaly profiles\nIn order to exploit the time scales (for instance for points (a) and (b) above) one\nmust be able to identify and interpret magnetic anomalies, or, more specifically\nfor marine surveys, magnetic profiles due to a succession of magnetic anomalies\nwith reverse polarity. In the interpretation one usually tries to find a combina\ntion of N and R 'blocks' that best matches the observed profile. This is easier\nsaid than done. A visual inspection of any of the profiles used as illustrations in,\nfor instance, it can be demonstrated that the relationship between the simplified\nblock models and the corresponding magnetic profiles is far from trivial. The\nmagnetic profiles look more complex than you would expect from the simple\nblock models, and this is true not only for real data but also for the synthetic\n(computer generated) profiles.\nIn the first place, the real sea floor is not magnetized in the form of regular\ngeometric bodies. The geological processes at work in a mid oceanic ridge\nenvironment are complex and so are the resulting patterns of magnetization. In\nparticular, the creation of new ocean floor in the so called emplacement zone\nis an irregular process that is not necessarily symmetric across the ridge axis.\nAlso the spreading rate has an effect in that fast spreading (Pacific rise) results in\nwide zones with the same magnetization which facilitates identification, whereas\nslow spreading (Atlantic) produces narrow anomalies with poor separation of\nthe anomalies, which complicates the analysis.\nBut even for a regular alternation of N and R polarity, say in a computer\nmodel, the magnetic profiles can be complicated. This is mainly due to the\ndipole character of the magnetic field as opposed to the monopoles in gravity,\nwhich means that the orientation of the anomaly plays an important role.\n\nCHAPTER 3. THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH\nBefore we look at this in more detail, let's define what we mean by a \"mag\nnetic anomaly\" in the context of marine surveys. At sea one uses proton pre\ncession magnetometers (see, for instance, Garland, 1979) that are towed behind\nthe ship. These instruments make use of the precession of hydrogen atoms after\na strong (artificial) ambient field generated by a current in a coil surrounding a\ncontained with many hydrogen atoms (e.g., water!) is switched off. When the\ninitial field that aligns the hydrogen dipole moments is switched off the hydro\ngen atoms precess with a frequency that depends on the strength of the ambient\nfield. The precession induces a current in the coil, which can be measured. Pre\ncession magnetometers measure the magnitude of the total magnetic field, not\nits direction (which means that they do not have to be orientated themselves!)\nand have a sensitivity of about 1 nT. The magnetic anomalies are determined\nby subtracting the IGRF from the observed values.\nIn vector notation, the total field B is given by the contributions of the main\nfield (the core field) BE and the magnetized body δB:\nB = BE + δB\n(3.87)\nBut the scalar magnetometer measures\nB = |B| = BE + A\n(3.88)\nwith A the magnetic anomaly.\n}\n(3.89)\nB = |B| = (B · B) = {BE · BE + 2BE · δB + δB · δB\n⇒ B = {B2\nE + 2BE · δB + δB2}\nTypically, δB is of the order of several hundreds of nT whereas BE is of the\norder of 20,000 to 60,000 nT. Therefore we can safely neglect δB2 so that\nB = {B2\nE + 2BE .δB}\n2 = BE {1 + 2 ˆBE δB|BE |-1}\n(3.90)\nwith the unit vector ˆBE in the direction of BE . The second term is small so\nthat this expression can be expanded in a binomial series\nB ≈ BE {1 + BE δB|BE |-1} = BE + ˆBE · δB\n(3.91)\nand we define the magnetic anomaly A, see (3.88) as\nˆ\nA = B - BE = BE · δB\n(3.92)\nIn other words, the only components of the local field δB that we measure\nis the one parallel to the direction of the ambient (core field). A vector diagram\nshows that this is a good approximation since δB ≪ BE . (For a dipole, the field\n-3\nis given by the gradient of the potential δB = -∇V = -∇(μ0/(4π)-1m·ˆrr\n}.)\nLet's consider some examples in which BE is approximated by an axial\ndipole. Assume an infinitely long block (lineation) that is magnetized in the\n\n3.18. MAGNETIC ANOMALY PROFILES\ndirection of the ambient Earth field. The magnetization direction can be de\ncomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the strike of the block.\nIt can be shown that the component ∥| to the strike does not contribute to a\nmagnetic anomaly since the infinitely small dipoles that make up the anomalous\nstructure all lie 'head-to-toe' and cancel out except for the ones near the end\n(which infinitely far away (in other words, the field lines never leave the body).\nIn this geometry, the magnetized body only has magnetization in the directions\n⊥ to the strike (say, in the x and z direction). Consequently, a N-S striking\nˆ\nanomaly magnetized at the equator will always have A = BE · δB = 0 since\nδB is orthogonal to BE (or, more precisely, there is no non-zero component of\nδB in the direction of ˆBE . In contrast, lineations magnetized at the pole and\nmeasured at the pole have ˆBE ∥|δB so that there will be a strong signal centered\nover the anomaly.\nThe effect of the orientation (which theoretically speaking gives rise to a\nphase shift) presents itself as a skewness of the anomalies (see diagram) which\ncan be corrected for (for instance by reducing the anomaly to the pole, see\ndiagram).\nIn addition to these distortions due to the phase shift there's the effect\nof amplitude modulation. Amplitude modulation consists, in fact, of two\ncontributions:\n1. usually, the magnetized body (at the ocean floor) is several km beneath\nthe vessel. The observed magnetic field thus represents the upward contin\nuation of the field at the source. As a result of the 1/r3 decay of the field\nthere is significant spatial attenuation of the high frequency components.\nSharp contrasts will be observed as more gradual transitions.\n2. Since the magnetized body can be thought to consist of dipoles a homo\ngeneously magnetized lineation will only display a magnetic anomaly near\nits ends; in between, the plus and minus poles cancel out (same argument\nas above) and no anomalous field is measured. This results in an effect\nknown as sagging. See diagram on next page.\n\nCHAPTER 3.

SEISMOLOGY\n4.2\nIntroduction\nWith seismology1 we face the same problem as with gravity and geomagnetism;\nwe can simply not offer a comprehensive treatment of the entire subject within\nthe time frame of this course. The material is therefore by no means complete.\nWe will discuss some basic theory to show how expressions for the propagation of\nelastic waves, such as P and S waves, can be obtained from the balance between\nstress and strain. This requires some discussion of continuum mechanics. Before\nwe do that, let's look at a very brief - and incomplete - overview of the historical\ndevelopment of seismology. Modern seismology is characterized by alternations\nof periods in which more progress is made in theory development and periods\nin which the emphasis seems to be more on data collection and the application\nof existing theory on new and - often - better quality data. It's good to realize\nthat observational seismology did not kick offuntil late last century (see section\n4.1). Prior to that \"seismology\" was effectively restricted to the development\nof the theory of elastic wave propagation, which was a popular subject for\nmathematicians and physicists. For some important dates, see attachment above\ntable (this historical overview is by no means complete but it does give an idea\nof the developments of thoughts).\nLay & Wallace (1995) give their view on\nthe current swing of the research pendulum in the following tables (with source\nrelated issues listed on the left and Earth structure topics on the right) :\nClassical Research Objectives\nA.

The velocity and acceleration of the particle\nare given by u = ∂u/∂t and u = ∂2u/∂2t, respectively. Volume elements are\ndenoted by ∆V and surface elements by δS. Body (or non-contact) forces, such\nas gravity, are written as f and tractions by t. A traction is the stress vector\nrepresenting the force per unit area across an internal oriented surface δS within\na continuum, and this is, in fact, the contact force F per unit area with which\nparticles on one side of the surface act upon particles on the other side of the\nsurface.\nA general form of a wave equation is ∂2u/∂2t = c2∂2u/∂2x or u = c2∇2u,\nwhich is a differential equation describing the propagation of a displacement\ndisturbance u with speed c.\nWe will see that the fundamental theory of wave propagation is primarily\nbased on two equations : Newton's second law ( F = ma = m∂2u/∂2t) and\nHooke's constitutive law F = -cu (stating that the extension of an elastic mate-\nrial results in a restoring force F, with c the elastic (spring) constant (not wave\nspeed as in the box above!). In one dimension, Hooke's law can also be formu-\nlated as the proportionality between stress σ and strain ε, with proportionality\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nfactor E is Young's modulus : σ = Eε. We will see that this linear relationship\nbetween stress and strain does not hold in 2D or 3D, in which case we need the\nso-called generalized Hooke's Law. For F = ma we have to consider both the\nnon-contact body forces, such as gravity that works on a certain volume, as well\nas the contact forces applied by the material particles on either side of arbitrary\nand imaginary internal surfaces. The latter are represented by tractions (\"stress\nvectors\"). We therefore have to look in some detail at the definitions of stress\nand strain.\n4.3\nStrain\nThe strain involves both length and angular distortions. To get the idea, let's\nconsider the deformation of a line element l1 between x and x + δx.\nDue to the deformation position x is displaced to x + u(x) and x + δx to x +\nδx + u(x + δx) and l1 becomes l2.\nThe strain in the x direction, εxx, can then be defined as\nεxx = l2 -l1\nl1\n= u(x + δx) -u(x)\nδx\n(4.1)\nIf we assume that δx is small we can linearize the problem around the 'reference\nstate' u(x) by using a Taylor expansion on u(x + δx) :\nu(x + δx) = u(x) +\n∂u\n∂x\n\nδx + O(δx2) ≈u(x) +\n∂u\n∂x\n\nδx\n(4.2)\nso that\nεxx =\n∂u(x)\n∂x\n\n= 1\n∂u(x)\n∂x\n+ ∂u(x)\n∂x\n\n(4.3)\nwhich represents the normal strain in the x direction. Similar relationships\ncan be derived for the normal strain in the other principal directions and also for\nthe shear strain εxy and εxz (etc), which involve the rotation of line elements\nwithin the medium.\nThe general form of the strain tensor εij is\nεij\n=\n∂u(xi)\n∂xj\n+ ∂u(xj)\n∂xi\n\n= 1\n∂ui\n∂xj\n+ ∂uj\n∂xi\n\n=\n∂uj\n∂xi\n+ ∂ui\n∂xj\n\n= εji\n(4.4)\n\n4.4. STRESS\nwith normal strains for i = j and shear strains for i = j. (In this discussion\nof deformation we do not consider translation and/or rotation of the material\nitself). Equation (4.4) shows that the strain tensor is symmetric, so that there\nthe maximum number of different coefficients is 6.\n4.4\nStress\nStress is force per unit area, and the principle unit is Nm-2 (or Pascal : 1Nm-2 = 1Pa).\nSimilar to strain, we can also distinguish between normal stress, the force\nF⊥per unit area that is perpendicular to the surface element δS, and the shear\nstress, which is the force F∥per unit area that is parallel to δS (see Fig. 4.1).\nThe force F acting on the surface element δS can be decomposed into three\ncomponents in the direction of the coordinate axes : F = (F1, F2, F3).\nWe\nfurther define a unit vector ˆn normal to the surface element δS. The length of\nˆn is, of course, |ˆn| = 1.\nFor stress we define the traction as a vector that represents the total force\nper unit area on δS. Similar to the force F, also the traction tt can be decom-\nposed into t = (t1, t2, t3) = t1x1 + t2x2 + t3x3. The traction t represents the\ntotal stress acting on δS.\nIn order to obtain a more useful definition of the traction t in terms of\nelements of the stress tensor consider a tetrahedron. Three sides of the tetra-\nhedron are chosen to be orthogonal to the principal axes in the sense that ∆si\nis orthogonal to xi; the fourth surface, δS, has an arbitrary orientation. The\nstress working on each of the surfaces of the tetrahedron can be decomposed\ninto components along the principal axes of the coordinate system. We use the\nfollowing notation convention : the component of the stress that works on the\nplane ⊥x1 in the direction of xi is σ1i, etc.\nFigure 4.1: Stress balancing in the stress tetrahedron.\nIf the system is in equilibrium then a force F that works on δS must be cancelled\nby forces acting on the other three surfaces : Fi = tiδS -σ1i∆s1 -σ2i∆s2 -\nσ3i∆s3 = 0 so that tiδS = σ1i∆s1 + σ2i∆s2 + σ3i∆s3.\nWe know that the\nexpression we are after should not depend on our choice of ∆s nor on δS (since\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nthe former were just chosen and the latter is arbitrary). This is easily achieved\nby realizing that δS and ∆S are related to each other : ∆si is nothing more than\nthe orthogonal projection of δS onto the plane perpendicular to the principal\naxis xi : ∆si = cos φiδS , with φi the angle between ˆn, the normal to δS, and\nxi. But cos φi is in fact simply ni so that ∆si = niδS. Using this we get :\ntiδS = σ1in1δS + σ2in2δS + σ3in3δS\n(4.5)\nor\nti = σ1in1 + σ2in2 + σ3in3\n(4.6)\nThus : the ith component of the traction vector t is given by a linear combination\nof stresses acting in the ith direction on the surface perpendicular to xj (or\nparallel to nj), where j = 1, 2, 3;\nti = σjinj\n(4.7)\nConversely, an element σji of the stress tensor is defined as the ith component\nof the traction acting on the surface perpendicular to the jth axis (xj) :\nσij = ti(xj)\n(4.8)\nThe 9 components σji of all tractions form the elements of the stress tensor.\nIt can be shown that in absence of body forces the stress tensor is symmetric\nσij = σji so that there are only 6 independent elements :\nσij =\n⎛\n⎝\nσ11\nσ12\nσ13\nσ21\nσ22\nσ12\nσ31\nσ32\nσ13\n⎞\n⎠=\n⎛\n⎝\nσ11\nσ12\nσ13\nσ22\nσ12\nσ13\n⎞\n⎠\n(4.9)\nThe normal stresses are represented by the diagonal elements (i=j) and the\nshear stresses are the offdiagonal elements (i = j). We can diagonalize the\nstress tensor by changing our coordinate system in such a way that there are\nno shear stresses on the surfaces perpendicular to any of the principal axes (see\nIntermezzo 4.2). The stress tensor then gets the form of\nσij =\n⎛\n⎝\nσ11\nσ22\nσ33\n⎞\n⎠=\n⎛\n⎝\nσ1\nσ2\nσ3\n⎞\n⎠\n(4.10)\nSome cases are of special interest :\n- uni-axial stress : only one of the principal stresses is non-zero, e.g.\nσ1 = 0, σ2 = σ3 = 0\n- plane stress : only one of the principal stresses is zero, e.g. σ1 = 0,\nσ2, σ3 = 0\n\n4.5.

For many practical purposes in seismology it is appropriate to ignore\nbody forces so that the equation of motion is simplified to :\nρ∂2ui\n∂t2 = ∂σij\n∂xj\nor\nρ ui = σij,j\n(4.14)\n2Gauss' divergence theorem states that in the absence of creation or destruction of matter,\nthe density within a region of space V can change only by having it flow into or away from\nthe region through its boundary S :\n\nS\nt. dS =\n\nV\n▽.tdV\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nIntermezzo 4.2 Diagonalization of a matrix\nMany problems in (geo)physics can be simplified if we can diagonalize a matrix.\nUnder certain conditions (almost always satisfied in geophysics), for any square\nmatrix A of dimension n, there exists a n × n matrix X that diagonalize A :\nX-1AX\n=\nλ = diag(λ1, ..., λn)\n=\n⎛\n⎜\n⎜\n⎝\nλ1\n...\n...\nλ2\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nλn-1\n...\n...\nλn\n⎞\n⎟\n⎟\n⎠\n(4.15)\nThis means that there exists a coordinate system in which A is diagonal. Di-\nagonalizing A corresponds to finding this coordinate system and the values of\nthe diagonal elements of A in this coordinate system. We can rewrite the last\nequation as follows :\nAX = λX\n(4.16)\nor\n(A -λI)X = 0\n(4.17)\nI is the Identity matrix. The λi (i = 1, ..., n) are called the eigenvalues of A\nand the columns of X are formed by n eigenvectors. Diagonalizing a matrix is\nequivalent to finding its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This is called an eigen-\nvalue problem. Finding the eigenvalues can easily be done by solving the system\nof n linear equations and n unknowns (the λi) formed by Eq. 4.17. This has a\nnon-trivial solution if the determinant is zero (this is called Cramer's rule) :\n|A -λI| = 0\n(4.18)\nThe eigenvectors can then be found by replacing the eigenvalues in the system of\nlinear equations formed by Eq. 4.17. If all eigenvalues are different, the n eigen-\nvectors are linearly independent and orthogonal. Otherwise, the eigenvalues are\nsaid to be degenerate and the number of independent eigenvectors is given by the\nnumber of independent eigenvalues. In the case of n independent eigenvalues,\nthe eigenvectors can form a new orthogonal basis and they are called principal\naxes. If we change the coordinate system and use the system defined by the\nprincipal axes, matrix A becomes diagonal and its elements are given by the\neigenvalues.\nIn the case of the stress tensor, equation 4.17 takes the form :\n(σ -σI)n = 0\n(4.19)\nThe three eigenvalues (also called principal stresses and represented by the\nscalar σ) are thus found by solving :\n|σ -σI| =\n\nσ11 -σ\nσ12\nσ13\nσ21\nσ22 -σ\nσ23\nσ31\nσ32\nσ33 -σ\n\n= 0\n(4.20)\nThis will give three values for σ (σ1, σ2 and σ3).\nIn the coordinate system\nformed by the three principal axes ni, the stress tensor is diagonal, as expressed\nin Eq. 4.10.\n\n4.5. EQUATIONS OF MOTION, WAVE EQUATION, P AND S-WAVES145\nNote that body forces such as gravity cannot always be ignored in - what is\nknown as - low-frequency seismology. For instance, gravity is an important\nrestoring force for some of Earth's free oscillations. We can also introduce a\nbody force term to describe the seismic source.\nWe've derived Eq. 4.14 using index notation. Let's state it in vector form.\nThe acceleration is proportional to the divergence of the stress tensor (see In-\ntermezzo 4.3) :\nρ u = ∇· σ\n(4.21)\nEquation (4.14) represents, in fact, three equations (for i=1,2,3) but there are\nmore than three unknowns (the 6 independent elements of the stress tensor σij\nplus density ρ. In this general form the equation of motion does not have a\nunique solution. Also, we have introduced forces and tractions but we not yet\nspecified how the material reacts to the applied (non-)contact forces. We need\nsome physics to help us out.\nSpecifically, we need to know the relationship\nbetween stress and strain, i.e. a constitutive relationship.\nIntermezzo 4.3 Divergence of a tensor\nWe know how to define the divergence of a vector. The divergence of a tensor\nis simply the generalization to higher dimensions of the divergence of a vector\n(remember that a vector is nothing more than a tensor of dimension 1).\nThe divergence of a vector v is a scalar denoted by ▽.v and given by :\n▽.v =\n\ni\n∂vi\n∂xi\n= ∂v1\n∂x1\n+ ∂v2\n∂x2\n+ ∂v3\n∂x3\n(4.22)\nSimilarly, the divergence of a dimension 2 tensor is a vector whose components\nare given by :\n(▽.σ)j =\n\ni\n∂σij\n∂xi\n= ∂σ1j\n∂x1\n+ ∂σ2j\n∂x2\n+ ∂σ3j\n∂x3\n(4.23)\nAnd we can further generalize : the divergence of a n-dimension tensor is a\ntensor of dimension n-1 obtained in a way similar to Eq. 4.23.\nIn one-dimension this relationship is given, as mentioned before, by σ = Eε\n(or σi = Eεi, where E is the Young's modulus, which is the ratio of uniaxial\nstress to strain in the same direction, i.e. a measure of the resistance against\nextension. A simple example demonstrates that in more dimensions this scalar\nproportionality breaks down. Imagine an elastic band : if one stretches this\nband in one direction, say the x1 direction, than the band will extend in that\ndirection. In other words there will be strain e11 due to stress σ11. However, the\nstrap will also thin in the x2 and x3 directions; so e22 = e33 = 0 even though\nσ22 = σ33 = 0.\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nClearly, a simple scalar relationship between the stress and strain tensors\nis invalid : σij = Eεij. Somehow we must express the elements of the stress\ntensor as a linear combination of the elements of the strain tensor. This linear\ncombination is given by a 4th order tensor cijkl of elastic constants :\nσij = Cijklεkl\n(4.24)\nThis form of the constitutive law for linear elasticity is known as the gener-\nalized Hooke's law and C is also known as the stiffness tensor. Substitution of\neq (4.24) in (4.14) gives the wave equation for the transmission of a displacement\ndisturbance with wave speed dependent on density ρ and the elastic constants\nin Cijkl in a general elastic, homogeneous medium (in absence of body forces) :\nρ ui = ρ∂2ui\n∂t2 =\n∂\n∂xj\n\nCijkl\n∂uk\n∂xl\n\n= Cijkl\n∂\n∂xj\n∂uk\n∂xl\n= Cijkluk,lj\n(4.25)\nIn three dimensions, a fourth order tensor contains 34 = 81 elements. What\ndid we gain by doing all this? After all, we mentioned above that we needed to\nintroduce a constitutive relationship in order to solve the wave equation (Eq.\n4.14) since the number of equations was less than the number of unknowns.\nNow we have arrived at a situation (Eq. 4.25) in which we have 3 equations\nto solve for 82 unknowns (density + 81 elastic moduli), so the introduction of\nphysics does not seem to have helped us at all! The situation improves once\nwe consider the intrinsic symmetry of the tensors involved.\nThe symmetry\nof the stress and strain tensors leads to symmetry of the elasticity tensor :\nCijkl = Cijlk = Cjilk. This reduces the number of independent elements in\nCijkl to 6×6=36. It can also be demonstrated (with less trivial arguments)\nthat Cijkl = Cklij, which further reduces the number of independent elements\nin Cijkl to 21.\nThis represents the most general (homogeneous) anisotropic\nmedium (anisotropy in this context means that the relationship between stress\nand strain is dependent on the direction i).\nBy restricting the complexity of the medium we can further reduce the num-\nber of independent elements of the elasticity tensor. For instance, one can inves-\ntigate special cases of anisotropy by allowing directional dependence in a plane\nperpendicular to certain symmetry axes only. We will come back to this later.\nThe simplest case is a homogeneous, isotropic medium (i.e. no directional\ndependence of elastic properties), and it can be shown (see, e.g., Malvern (1969))\nthat in this situation the general form of the 4th order (linear) elasticity tensor\nis\nCijkl = λδijδkl + μ(δikδjl + δilδjk)\n(4.26)\nwhere λ and μ are the only two independent elements; λ and μ are known as\nLam e's (elastic) constants (or moduli), after the French mathematician G. Lam e.\n(The Kronecker (delta) function δij = 1 for i = j and δij = 0 for i = j).\nSubstitution of Eq. (4.26) in (4.24) gives for the stress tensor\nσij = Cijklεkl = λδijεkk + 2μεij = λδij∆+ 2μεij\n(4.27)\n\n4.6. P AND S-WAVES\nwith ∆the cubic dilation, or volume change. This form of Hooke's law was\nfirst derived by Navier (1820-ies). The Lam e constant μ is known as the shear\nmodulus or rigidity : it is a measure of the resistance against shear or torsion\nof the medium. The shear modulus is large for very stiffmaterial, but is small\nfor media with low viscosity (μ = 0 for water or for liquid metallic iron in the\nouter core). The other Lam e constant, λ, does not have much (general) physical\nmeaning by itself, but defines important elastic parameters in combination with\nthe shear modulus μ. Of most interest for us right now is the definition of κ,\nthe bulk modulus or incompressibility : κ = λ+2/3μ. The bulk modulus is\na measure of the resistance against volume change : κ = -∂P/∂∆, with P the\npressure and ∆the cubic dilatation, and is large when the change in volume is\nsmall even for large (hydrostatic) pressure. The minus sign is necessary to keep\nκ > 0 since ∆< 0 when P > 0. For isotropic media other important elastic\nparameters, such as the Poisson's ratio, i.e. the ratio of lateral contraction to\nlongitudinal extension, and Young's modulus can also be expressed as linear\ncombinations of λ and μ (or κ and μ). We can readily see that the stress tensor\nconsists of terms representing (resistance to) either changes in volume or shear\n(or torsion).\nstress : effects of volume change + torsion (or shear) of material\nThis is a fundamental result and it underlies, what we will see below, the for-\nmulation of wave propagation in terms of compressional (dilatational) P and\ntransversal (shear) S-waves.\nWith the above constitutive relationships we can now derive the equation\nthat describes wave propagation in a homogeneous, isotropic medium\nρ∂2ui\n∂t2 = (λ + μ) ∂\n∂xi\n∂uk\n∂xk\n+ μ∇2ui\n(4.28)\nwhich represents a system of three equations (for i=1,2,3) with three unknowns\n(ρ, λ, μ). Note that for practical purposes in seismology these parameters are not\nreally constant; in Earth they are functions of position r and vary significantly,\nin particular with depth.\n4.6\nP and S-waves\nThere are several ways to demonstrate that solutions of the equation of motion\nessentially consist of a dilatational and a rotational term, the P and S-waves,\nrespectively. Using vector notation the equation of motion is written as\nρ u = (λ + μ)∇(∇· u) + μ∇2u\n(4.29)\nor, by making use of the vector identity\n∇2u = ∇(∇· u) -(∇× ∇× u),\n(4.30)\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nwe can write the equation of motion as :\nρ u = (λ + 2μ)∇(∇· u) -μ(∇× ∇× u)\n↑\n↑\ndilatational\nrotational\n(4.31)\nwhich is a system of three partial differential equations for a general displace-\nment field u through an unbounded, homogeneous, and isotropic medium.\nIn general, it is difficult to solve this system directly for the displacement u.\nTypically, one tries to decompose the general wave equation into separate equa-\ntions that relate to P- and S-wave propagation. One approach is to eliminate di-\nrectly any rotational contributions to the displacement by taking the divergence\nof Eq. (4.31) and using the property that for a vector field a, ∇· (∇× a) = 0.\nSimilarly we can eliminate the dilatational contributions by taking the rotation\nof (4.31) and using the identity that, for a scalar field μ, ∇×∇μ = 0. Assuming\nno body force f, we get :\n- Taking the divergence leads to\nρ∂2(∇· u)\n∂t2\n= (λ + 2μ)∇2(∇· u)\n(4.32)\nor, with ∇· u = Θ,\n∂2Θ\n∂t2 = α2∇2Θ\n(4.33)\nwhich is a scalar wave equation that describes the propagation of a volume\nchange Θ through the medium with wave speed\nα =\n\nλ + 2μ\nρ\n=\n\nκ + 4/3μ\nρ\n(4.34)\nIn general κ = κ(r), μ = μ(r), ρ = ρ(r) ⇒α = α(r)\n- Taking the rotation leads to\nρ∂2(∇× u)\n∂t2\n= (λ + 2μ)∇× ∇(∇· u) -μ∇× (∇× ∇× u)\n(4.35)\nwhich, with ∇× ∇(∇· u) = 0 and the vector identity as used above (and\nagain using ∇· (∇× a) = 0), leads to :\n∂2(∇× u)\n∂2t\n= β2∇2(∇× u)\n(4.36)\n\n4.6. P AND S-WAVES\nThis is a vector wave equation that describes the transmission through a\nmedium of a rotational disturbance ∇× u with wave speed\nβ =\nμ\nρ\n(4.37)\nIn general μ = μ(r), ρ = ρ(r) ⇒β = β(r)\nThe dilatational and rotational components of the displacement field are\nknown as the P and S-waves, and α and β are the P and S-wave speed, respec-\ntively.\nAnother (more elegant) way to see that solutions of the wave equation are\nin fact P and S-waves is by realizing that any vector field can be represented by\na combination of the gradient of some scalar potential and the curl of a vector\npotential. This decomposition is known as Helmholtz's Theorem and the\npotentials are often referred to as Helmholtz Potentials. Using Helmholtz's\nTheorem we can write for the displacement u\nu = ∇Φ + ∇× Ψ\n(4.38)\nand\n∇.Ψ = 0\n(4.39)\nwith Φ a rotation-free scalar potential (i.e. ∇× Φ = 0) and Ψ the divergence-\nfree vector potential. Substitution of (4.38) into the general wave equation (4.31)\n(and applying the vector identity (4.30)) we get :\n∇[(λ + 2μ)∇2Φ -ρ Φ] + ∇× [μ∇2Ψ -ρ Ψ] = 0\n(4.40)\nwhich is a third-order differential equation3. Equation (4.40) can be satisfied\nby requiring that both\n(λ + 2μ)∇2Φ -ρ Φ = 0\n(4.41)\nwhich is a scalar wave equation for the propagation of the rotation-free displace-\nment field Φ with wave speed\nα =\n\nλ + 2μ\nρ\n=\n\nκ + 4/3μ\nρ\n(4.42)\nand\nμ∇2Ψ -ρ Ψ = 0\n(4.43)\n3Strictly speaking this is not the way to formulate the problem. The need to solve third-\norder differential equations could have been avoided if the problem was set up in a different\nway by making use of what is known as Lam e's theorem. This also involves Helmholtz\npotentials. See, for instance, Aki & Richards, Quantitative Seismology (1982) p. 67-69.\nThis mathematical correctness is, however, not required for a basic understanding of the\ndecomposition in P and S terms\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nwhich is a vector wave equation for the propagation of the divergence-free dis-\nplacement field Ψ with wave speed\nβ =\nμ\nρ\n(4.44)\nComparing Eq. 4.33 and 4.41, we can identify Φ with the volume change (∇· u\nis called the cubic dilatation). Similarly, Ψ can be identified with the rotational\ncomponent of the displacement field by comparing Eq. 4.36 and 4.42.\nIt is often much easier to solve the wave equations (4.41) and (4.43) than to\nsolve the equation of motion directly for u, and from the solution for the poten-\ntials the displacement u can then determined directly by Eq. (4.38). Note that\neven though P and S-waves are often treated separately, the total displacement\nfield comprises both wave types.\nLet's now consider a Cartesian coordinate system with z oriented downward,\nx parallel with the plane of the paper, and y out of the paper. We'll make the\nx-z plane the special plane of the problem. Because ∂/∂yΦˆy = 0, we can write :\n∇Φ = ∂\n∂xΦˆx + ∂\n∂zΦˆz\n(4.45)\nand\n∇× Ψ =\n\n∂/∂x\n∂/∂y\n∂/∂z\nΨx\nΨy\nΨz\nˆx\nˆy\nˆz\n\n(4.46)\nTherefore,\nux\n=\n∂Φ\n∂x -∂Ψy\n∂z\nuy\n=\n∂Ψz\n∂x -∂Ψx\n∂z\nuz\n=\n∂Φ\n∂z + ∂Ψy\n∂x\n(4.47)\nThe displacement direction from Φ is in the x-z plane and it is compressional\n-- Φ is the P-wave potential. P wave propagation is thus rotation-free and has\nno components perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, k : it is\na longitudinal wave with particle motion in the direction of k.\nIn contrast,\nthe particle motion associated with the purely rotational S-wave is in a plane\nperpendicular to k : transverse particle motion can be decomposed into vertical\npolarization, the so-called SV wave, and horizontal polarization, the so-called\nSH-wave (see Fig. 4.2) The displacement uy from the SV -wave potential is in\nthe same plane. In this formulation, uy could just as well have been called the\nSH-wave potential with displacement direction perpendicular to the x-z-plane.\n\n4.7. FROM VECTOR TO SCALAR POTENTIALS - POLARIZATION 151\nFigure 4.2: P and S waves : partical motion and propagation\ndirection.\n4.7\nFrom vector to scalar potentials - Polariza-\ntion\nUsing the Fourier transform, we show that the vector decomposition with Φ\nand Ψ can be reduced into three equations with the scalar potentials Φ, ΨSV\nand ΨSH (waves are typically described by oscillatory functions, i.e. complex\nexponentials.\nIt is therefore natural to move the analysis to the frequency\ndomain, i.e.\nto use Fourier transforms).\nWe will write u(r, t) for the time\nand space domain displacement, and u(r, ω) for the displacement in space and\nfrequency. The transformation to the frequency domain is done by means of the\n(temporal) Fourier transform, which is defined as :\nu(r, ω)\n=\ninf\n\n-inf\nu(r, t)eiωt dt\n(4.48)\nu(r, t)\n=\n2π\n+π\n\n-π\nu(r, ω)e-iωt dω\n(4.49)\nIt is easy to see how the time derivative in a partial differential equation (PDE)\nbrings out a factor of iω. This can be verified using the PDE obtained in section\n4.6 :\nρ∂2u\n∂t2 = (λ + 2μ)∇(∇· u) -μ∇× (∇× u)\n(4.50)\nThe separation of the equation of motion into two parts was done in section\n4.6. It can also be done in the frequency domain : using Eq. 4.49 and Eq. 4.38,\nEq. 4.50 (the equation of motion) becomes :\nω2Φ\n=\n-α2∇· u\n(4.51)\nω2Ψ\n=\n-β2∇× u\n(4.52)\nWe thus easily get :\n\nCHAPTER 4.

SOLUTION BY SEPARATION OF VARIABLES\n4.8\nSolution by separation of variables\nIn a way, we've solved the wave equation by realizing that we could reduce it to\nan ordinary differential equation using the Fourier transform. So we knew the\nsolution would be a complex exponential in the time variable (it is a \"natural\"\nway of describing a wave). We will now justify the validity of this approach by\nattempting to solve the following partial differential equation :\nc2∇2Φ =\n∂\n∂t2 Φ\n(4.54)\nwithout resorting to the Fourier transform.\nIf we propose a solution by separation of variables :\nΦ = X(x)Y (y)Z(z)T (t)\n(4.55)\nand plug Eq. 4.55 into Eq. 4.54, we obtain :\nX\nd2X\ndx2 + 1\nY\nd2Y\ndy2 + 1\nZ\nd2Z\ndz2 -\nc2T\nd2T\ndt2 = 0\n(4.56)\nThe partial derivatives are regular derivatives now : we went from a PDE to\nordinary differential equations (ODE). Each of these terms needs to be constant.\nWe can pick these constants (ω2 for T , and k2\nx, k2\ny and k2\nz for the spatial func-\ntions) but they will not be independent (they are linked to one another through\nEq. 4.56). If we pick ω, kx and ky, then kz is not independent anymore and\nsatisfies :\nk2\nz = ω2\nc2 -k2\nx -k2\ny\n(4.57)\nWith those constants, it is easy to show that X, Y , Z and T are oscillatory\nfunctions :\nX\n∼\nexp(±ikxx)\nY\n∼\nexp(±ikyy)\nZ\n∼\nexp(±ikzz)\nT\n∼\nexp(±iωt)\n(4.58)\nWe have obtained solutions to the wave equation.\nOf course any linear\ncombination of particular solutions leads to the general solution, and also we\nneed to pick the sign in Eq. 4.58 (from the boundary conditions).\nRelation\n4.57 is called a dispersion relation. kx, ky and kz can be seen as the cartesian\ncomponent of a vector k and Φ can be written as an oscillatory function of the\ntype\nΦ ∝exp(i(k · r -ωt))\n(4.59)\nThese waves are called plane waves and k is the direction of wave propagation.\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\n4.9\nPlane waves\nWe've called functions of the type exp(i(k · r -ωt)) plane waves. Let's look at\na few characteristics.\nTraveling waves Let's first notice that plane waves are of the general form\ndescribing traveling waves :\nΦ(x, t) = f(x -ct) + g(x + ct)\n(4.60)\nwith f and g arbitrary functions, provided that they are twice differentiable\nwith regard to space and time (and that the second derivatives are continuous).\nAfter all, they need to solve Φ = c2∇2Φ. This is referred to as d'Alembert's\nsolution. The function f(x -ct) represents a disturbance propagating in the\npositive x direction with speed c. The function g(x+ct) represents a disturbance\npropagating in the negative x axis : this part of the solution will be ignored\nin the following, but it must be taken into account when dealing with wave\ninterference.\nWavelength\nWith k = 2π/λ, the spatial part can be manipulated as follows:\nei 2π\nλ x = ei 2π\nλ xei2πN = ei 2π\nλ (x+Nλ)\n(4.61)\nto show that λ is indeed the wave length -- after this distance, the displacement\npattern repeats itself.\nFigure 4.4: Plane waves : propagating disturbances.\nPhase\nWith increasing time t the argument of function f does not change provided\nthat x also increases (hence the propagation in the positive x axis). In other\nwords, if the argument remains constant it means that the shape defined by\nfunction f translates through space. The argument of f, x-ct, is referred to as\nthe phase; one can define the wave front as the propagating function for a given\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nt = t0\nt0\nt'\nt = t'\nX1 = X0\ng\ng\nX1 = X0\nX0\nX'\ng(X1 - Ct0)\ng(X1 - Ct')\ng(X0 - Ct)\nX1\nX1\nt\n\n4.9. PLANE WAVES\nvalue of the phase. That c is the phase velocity is easily obtained by considering a\nconstant phase at times t and t′ (x-ct = x′-ct′ ⇒c = (x′-x)/(t′-t) ≈dx/dt ≡\nspeed).\nWavefront\nA wavefront is a surface through all points of equal phase, i.e. a surface\nconnecting all points at the same travel time T from the source (see Fig. 4.5).\nIn other words, at the wave front, all particles move in phase. Rays are the\nnormals to the wave fronts and they point in the direction of wave propagation.\nThe use of rays, ray paths, and wave fronts in seismology has many similarities\nwith optics, and is called geometric ray theory.\nFigure 4.5: Seismic wavefronts.\nPlane waves have plane wave fronts. The function Φ remains unchanged for\nall points on the plane perpendicular to the wave vector : indeed, on such a\nplane, the dot product k · r is constant.\nAt distances sufficiently far from the source body waves can be model-led\nas plane waves.\nAs a rule of thumb : observer must be more than 5 wave\nlengths away from source to apply far field -- or plane wave -- approximation.\nCloser to the source one would need to consider spherical waves. Note that a\nseismogram corresponds to the recording of u = u(r0, t) at a fixed position r0;\ni.e. the displacement as a function of time that records the passage of a wave\ngroup past r0.\nPolarization direction\nThe polarization direction is different from the propagation direction. As\nalready mentionned in sections 4.8 and 4.7, all waves propagate in the direction\nof their wave vector k. The P-wave displacement (∇Φ) is parallel with the k.\nThe SV -displacement (∇× (ˆyΨ)) is perpendicular to this, in the x -z plane,\nand the SH-displacement is out of the plane.\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nTo indicate explicitly the propagation in the direction of or perpendicular to\nwave vector k, one sometimes also writes\nfor P-waves:\nfor S-waves:\nΦ(r, t) = Ank ei(k·r-ωt)\nΦ(r, t) = Bn × k ei(k·r-ωt)\n(4.62)\nLow- and high-frequency seismology\nThe variables used to describe the harmonic components are related as fol-\nlows;\nAngular frequency\nω = kc\nWavelength\nλ = cT = 2π/k\nWavenumber\nk = ω/c\nFrequency\nf = ω/2π = c/λ\nPeriod\nT = 1/f = λ/c = 2π/ω\nSeismic waves have frequencies f ranging roughly from about 0.3 mHz to\n100 Hz. The longest period considered in seismology is that associated with\nfundamental free oscillations of the earth : T ≈59 min. For a typical wave\nspeed of 5 km/s this involves signal wavelengths between 15,000 km and 50m.\nA loose subdivision in seismological problems is based on frequency, although\nthe boundaries between these fields are vague (and have no physical meaning) :\nlow frequency seismology\nf <20 mHz\nλ > 250 km\nhigh frequency seismology\n50 mHz < f <10 Hz\n0.5 km < λ < 100 km\nexploration seismics:\nf > 10 Hz\nλ < 500 m\n4.10\nSome remarks\n1. The existence of P and S-waves was first demonstrated by Poisson (in\n1828). He also showed that P and S-type waves are, in fact, the only solu-\ntions of the wave equations for an unbounded medium (a 'whole' space), so\nthat u = ∇Φ+∇×Ψ provides the complete solution for the displacement\nin an elastic, isotropic and homogeneous medium. Later we will see that\nif the medium is not unbounded, for instance a half-space with perhaps\nsome stratification, there are more solutions to the general equation of\nmotions. Those solutions are the surface (Rayleigh and Love) waves.\n2. Since κ > 0 and μ ≥0 ⇒α > β : P-waves propagate faster than shear\nwaves! See Fig. 4.6.\n3. It can be shown that independent propagation of the P and S-waves is only\nguaranteed for sufficiently high frequencies (the so-called high-frequency\napproximation, \"high frequency\" in the sense that spatial variations in\n\n4.11. NOMENCLATURE OF BODY WAVES IN EARTH'S INTERIOR 157\nelastic properties occur over much larger distances than the wavelength\nof the waves involved) underlies most (but not all) of the theory for body\nwave propagation).\n4. The three components of the wave field (P, SV, and SH-waves, see section\n4.7 for more details) can be recorded completely with three orthogonal\nsensors. In seismometry one uses a vertical component [Z] sensor along\nwith two horizontal component sensors. In the field the latter two are\noriented along the North-South [N] and East-West [E] directions, respec-\ntively. Fig. 4.7 is an example of such a three-component recording; we\nwill come back to this in more detail later in the course.\nDepth (km)\nWave speed (kms-1)\nVp\nVs\nFigure 4.6: P and S wave speed in the ak135 Earth model.\n4.11\nNomenclature of body waves in Earth's in-\nterior\nAt this stage it is useful to introduce the jargon used to describe the different\ntypes of body wave propagation in Earth's interior. We will get back to several\nwave propagation issues in more detail after we have discussed the basics of\nray theory and the construction and use of travel time curves. There are a few\nsimple basic \"rules\", but there are also some inconsistencies :\n- Capital letters are used to denote body wave propagation (transmission)\nthrough a medium. For example, P and S for the compressional and shear\nwaves, respectively, K and I for outer and inner core propagation of com-\npressional waves (K for German 'Kerne'; I for Inner core), and J for shear\nwave propagation in the Inner Core (no definitive observations of this seis-\nmic phase, although recent research has produced compelling evidence for\nits existence).\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nFigure 4.7: Example of a three-component seismic record\n- Lower case letters are either used to indicate either reflections (e.g., c\nfor the reflection at the CMB, i for the reflection at the ICB, and d for\nreflections at discontinuities in the mantle, with d standing for a particular\ndepth (e.g., '410' or '660' km), or upward propagation of body waves\nbefore they are reflected at Earth's surface (e.g., s for an upward traveling\nshear wave, p for an upward traveling P wave). Note that this is always\nused in combination of a transmitted wave : for example, the phase pP\nindicates a wave that travels upward from a deep earthquake, reflects at\nthe Earth's surface, and then travels to a distant station.\nFigure 4.8: Nomenclature of body waves\n\n4.12. MORE ON THE DISPERSION RELATION\n4.12\nMore on the dispersion relation\nWe have already introduced the concept of dispersion (Eq. 4.57). Searching for\na solution by separation of varibles, we have seen that the solution to the wave\nequation is an exponential both in the time and space domain. We had, how-\never,already shown the oscillatory behavior of the solution in the time domain\nby using the time Fourier transform. In this section, we go one step further.\nPredicting that the solution will be a complex exponential in the spatial domain\nas well, we will investigate what insight the spatial Fourier-transform will bring\nus. Time and space are linked through the wave equation (it is a PDE) - the\nlinkage between them is by the dispersion relation which we are deriving here.\nAs definition for the spatial Fourier transform and its inverse, we take\nΦ(k, ω) =\n\nV\nΦ(r, ω)e-ik·r d3r\n(4.63)\nand\nΦ(r, ω) =\n(2π)3\n\nK\nΦ(k, ω)eik·r d3k\n(4.64)\nThe integrations are over all of physical space V (dxdydz) and all of wave\nvector space K (dkxdkydkz), respectively. The dot product k·r = kqxq with the\nEinstein summation convention. Remember also that k2\np = kpkp = |k| = k2.We\nneed the Laplacian of Φ, this is given by :\n∇2Φ =\n∂2\n∂xp∂xp\n=\n(2π)3\n\nK\nΦ(k, ω)eikqxqi2k2\np d3k\n(4.65)\nComparison with Eq. 4.54 leads to (call α or β now c) :\n-k2 + ω2\nc2 = 0\nor\n|k| =\nω\nα\n\n(4.66)\nWe can quickly convert this dispersion relation into something you're all familiar\nwith : with k = 2π/λ and f = ω/(2π), we get λf = c : the frequency of a wave\ntimes its wave lengths gives the propagation speed. We will discuss this in more\ndetail below.\nThe complete solution to the wave equation is thus given by inverse trans-\nformation of Φ(r, ω) as follows :\nΦ(r, t) =\n(2π)4\n+inf\n\n-inf\n+inf\n\n-inf\n+inf\n\n-inf\nΦ(kx, ky, ω, z)ei(k·r-ωt) dkx dky dω\n(4.67)\nThere are three independent quantities involved here (not four) : kx, ky and\nω, and their relationship is given by the dispersion equation. In other words,\nk · r = kxx + kyy + z\nω2\nc2 -k2\nx -k2\ny\n1/2\n(4.68)\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nIt's important to see Eq. 4.67 as what it is : a superposition (integral) of plane\nwaves with a certain wave vector and frequency, each with its own amplitude.\nThe amplitude is a coefficient which will have to be determined from the initial\nor boundary conditions.\nWe thus have seen that the dispersion equation can be obtained either by\nsolving the wave equation by separation of variables or by introducing the time\nand spatial Fourier transforms.\n4.13\nThe wave field -- Snell's law\nIn this section, we'll use plane wave displacement potentials to solve a sim-\nple problem of wave propagation. Not only will we understand why and how\nreflections, refractions and phase conversions happen, but we'll also derive an\nimportant relation for plane waves in planar media known as Snell's law.\nLet's start with a plane P-wave incident on the free surface, making an angle\nwith the normal i. We can identify the P-wave with its wave vector. In our\ncase, we know that\nkx =\nω\nα\nsin i\nand\nkz = -\nω\nα\ncos i\n(4.69)\nTwo kinds of boundary conditions are used in seismology -- there are the\nkinematic ones, which put constraints on the displacement, and the dynamic\nones, which constrain the stresses or tractions. The free surface needs to be\ntraction-free. We remember that the traction vector was given by dotting the\nstress tensor into the normal vector representing the plane on which we are\ncomputing the tractions : ti = σijnj.\nFor a normal vector in the positive\nz-direction, the traction becomes :\nt(u,ˆz) = (σxz, σyz, σzz)\n(4.70)\nFor isotropic materials, we have seen the following definition for the stress ten-\nsor :\nσij = λ(∇· u)δij + μ\n∂ui\n∂xj\n+ ∂uj\n∂xi\n\n(4.71)\nTractions due to the P wave\nWe know that the displacement is given by the gradient of the P-wave dis-\nplacement potential Φ (see Eq. 4.47) :\nu = ∇Φ =\n∂Φ\n∂x , 0, ∂Φ\n∂z\n\n(4.72)\nTherefore the required components of the stress tensor are :\n\n4.13. THE WAVE FIELD -- SNELL'S LAW\nσxz\n=\n2μ ∂2Φ\n∂x∂z\n(4.73)\nσyz\n=\n(4.74)\nσzz\n=\nλ∇2Φ + 2μ∂2Φ\n∂2z\n(4.75)\nTractions due to the SV wave\nThe displacement is given as the rotation of the Ψ potential (see Eq. 4.47) :\nu =\n\n-∂Ψ\n∂z , 0, ∂Ψ\n∂x\n\n(4.76)\nFor the stress tensor, we find :\nσxz\n=\nμ\n∂2Ψ\n∂x2 -∂2Ψ\n∂z2\n\n(4.77)\nσxz\n=\n(4.78)\nσzz\n=\n2μ ∂2Ψ\n∂x∂z\n(4.79)\nTractions due to the SH wave\nThe SH wave, as we've seen, has only one component in this coordinate\nsystem :\nu = (0, uy, 0)\n(4.80)\nand the stress tensor components are given by\nσxz\n=\n(4.81)\nσyz\n=\nμ∂uy\n∂z\n(4.82)\nσzz\n=\n(4.83)\nComparing Eqs. 4.75 and 4.79, we see how P and SV waves are naturally\ncoupled. In this plane-wave plane-layered case, the P-wave had energy only\nin the x- and z-component, and so did SV . Upon reflection and refraction,\nenergy can be transferred from the incoming P-wave to a reflected P-wave and\na reflected SV -wave. No SH waves can enter the system -- they have all their\nenergy on the y-component.\nAnalogously to Eq. 4.69, we can represent the incoming P, the reflected P\nand the reflected SV wave by the following slownesses :\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nP inc\n=\nsin i\nα , 0, -cosi\nα\n\n(4.84)\nP refl\n=\nsin i∗\nα\n, 0, cos i∗\nα\n\n(4.85)\nSV refl\n=\nsin j\nβ , 0, cos j\nβ\n\n(4.86)\nThus the total P-potential Φ is made up from the incoming and reflecting P-\nwave, and the shear-wave potential Ψ is given by the reflected SV -wave. All of\nthem, of course, have the plane wave form, so that we can write :\nΦinc\n=\nA exp\n\niω\nsin i\nα x -cos i\nα z -t\n\n(4.87)\nΦrefl\n=\nB exp\n\niω\nsin i∗\nα\nx + cos i∗\nα\nz -t\n\n(4.88)\nΨrefl\n=\nC exp\n\niω\nsin j\nα x + cos j\nα z -t\n\n(4.89)\nAs pointed out before, there are no kinematic boundary conditions on the\nfree surface. The displacement of the free surface is unconstrained, and above\nit there is no displacement at all. The dynamic boundary conditions, however,\nare non-trivial. The tractions must vanish on the free surface : so σxz = σyz =\nσzz = 0 at z = 0. It is easy to see that, with z = 0, the sum of the three plane\nwave displacement potentials will be of the type\nA exp\n\niω\nsin i\nα x -t\n\n+\nB exp\n\niω\nsin i∗\nα\nx -t\n\n+\nC exp\n\niω\nsin j\nα x -t\n\nHence, for this sum to be zero for all x and t, we need :\nsin i\nα\n= sin i∗\nα\n= sin j\nβ\n≡p\n(4.90)\nThus, for plane waves in plane-layered media, the whole system of rays is\ncharacterized by a common horizontal slowness. This is true for the whole wave\nfield of reflected and transmitted (refracted) waves. Eq. 4.90 is known as Snell's\nlaw and p is called the ray parameter. In the following paragraph, a more\ngeneral principle called Fermat's principle is used to prove Snell's Law.\n\n4.14. FERMAT'S PRINCIPLE AND SNELL'S LAW\n4.14\nFermat's Principle and Snell's law\nAn important principle in optics is Fermat's principle, which governs the geom-\netry of ray paths. This principle states that a wave propagating from position\nA to position B follows a path of stationary time. The principle of stationary\ntime plays a fundamental role in high frequency seismology. Note that station-\nary time does not necessarily mean minimum time; it can also be a maximum\ntime.\nFigure 4.9: The principle of stationary time.\nConsider Fig. 4.9. A ray leaves point P that is in a medium with wave\nspeed c1 and travels to point Q in a medium with wave speed c2. What path\nwill the ray take to Q? Since the wave speeds in the media are constant the ray\npath in each medium is a straight line, so that in this simple case the geometry\nis completely defined by the positions of P, Q, and the point x where the ray\ncrosses the interface.\nThe travel time on an arbitrary path between P and Q is given by\ntP -Q = d\nc1\n+ e\nc2\n=\n√\na2 + x2\nc1\n+\n\nb2 + (c -x)2\nc2\n(4.91)\nFor the path to be a stationary time path (i.e. time is maximum or minimum)\nwe simply set the spatial derivative of the travel time to zero :\ndT\ndx = 0 =\nx\nc1\n√\na2 + x2 -\nc -x\nc2\n\nb2 + (c -x)2\n(4.92)\nand note that\nx\n√\na2 + x2 = sin i1\nand\nc -x\n\nb2 + (c -x)2 = sin i2\n(4.93)\nThis gives Snell's law :\nsin i2\nc2\n= sin i1\nc1\n≡p\n(4.94)\np is called the ray parameter.\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nOne can expand on this simple geometry and consider many more layers,\nbut the result is the same : the ray parameter p is constant along the entire ray!\nAs a ray enters material of increasing velocity, the ray is deflected toward the\nhorizontal; if the ray enters material with lower velocity, the ray is deflected to\nthe vertical. In seismology the angle between the ray and the vertical is referred\nto as the angle of incidence (also, take-offangle).\n4.15\nRay geometries of the wave field\nFor most applications we have to deal with a complex wave field : in each layer\nof a stratified medium there can be 6 different body wave groups : the up- and\ndown-going P, SV, and SH-waves. The propagation of such a wave field through\na stratified medium (a stack of horizontal layers or spherical shells in which the\nwave speed is constant) is controlled by Snell's law (Fermat's Principle) and\nboundary conditions.\nThe wave field is determined by reflections, refractions, and phase con-\nversions; for instance, a down-going P wave can reflect at an interface and part\nof its energy can be transmitted to the other side, and part of its energy can\n(or often has to be) converted to SV-wave energy (see Fig. 4.10).\nFigure 4.10: Ray conversions at interfaces.\nThe incidence angles of the reflected and refracted waves that compose this\ncomplex wave field are controlled by an extended form of Snell's law. For this\nexample, Snell's law is :\nsin i1\nα1\n= sin j1\nβ1\n= sin i2\nα2\n= sin j2\nβ2\n≡p\n(4.95)\nThis generalization of Snell's law shows an important concept that the whole\nsystem of seismic waves produced by reflection and transmission of plane waves\nin a stratified medium is characterized by the value of their common horizontal\nslowness, or the ray parameter p. It can also be used directly to determine the\nangles for critical reflection and refraction. The ray parameter is constant not\nonly for a single ray, but for the entire wave field generated by reflection and\nrefraction of an incoming P or S-wave.\n\n4.16. TRAVEL TIME CURVES AND RADIAL EARTH STRUCTURE\n4.16\nTravel time curves and radial Earth struc-\nture\nWe have been developing some basic theory and concepts of body wave seis-\nmology.\nOne of the major objectives of seismology is to extract structural\ninformation about Earth's structure from the observed data, the seismograms.\nWe will discuss some rather classical techniques to do this.\nSnell's Law\nWe derived Snell's law for a \"flat\" Earth :\nsin i1\nc1\n= sin i2\nc2\n= . . . = sin in\ncn\n= constant ≡p, the ray parameter\n(4.96)\nThe ray parameter is constant along the entire ray path, and is the same for\nall rays (reflections, refractions, conversions) associated with the same incoming\nray. The ray parameter plays a very important role in seismology.\nSnell's Law shows that the ray parameter is inversely proportional to velocity,\nor proportional to 1/velocity, which is the slowness. In seismology it is often\nmore convenient to use slowness instead of wave speed. One significant advantage\nof the slowness vector is that it can be added vectorially, whereas this is not\nalways justified (in our context) for the velocity.\ns = (s1, s2, s3) = s1x1 + s2x2 + s3x3\n(4.97)\nThe vector summation for velocity can give practical problems : consider,\nfor instance, the plane wave that propagates in the direction k. The apparent\nvelocity c1 measured at the surface (from observations at several stations) is\nlarger than the true velocity c : with i the angle of incidence, c1 = c/ sin i > c,\nso that c = c1 + c3.\nFrom Fig. 4.11 we can easily derive two other important relationships :\nsin i = ds\ndx1\n= c dt\ndx1\n= c\nc1\n⇒p = sin i\nc\n= dt\ndx1\n= 1\nc1\n(4.98)\nFigure 4.11: Derivation of Snell's law.\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\n1. The ray parameter p is 1/cx, which is referred to as the horizontal slow-\nness!\n2. the ray parameter is simply the derivative of the travel time T with hor-\nizontal distance. This will prove to be of major importance (and conve-\nnience!).\nFor a spherical earth we can derive a relationship for the ray parameter that\nis similar to Eq. (4.98), the \"only\" difference being the 'scale' factor r :\np = r sin i\nv(r)\n(4.99)\nwhere r is the radius to any point along the ray path, and v(r) the wave speed\nat that radius. It can also be shown that (with ∆the angular distance)\np = ∂T\n∂∆\n(4.100)\nFigure 4.12: Ray parameter in spherical geometry\nNotice the similarity between the definition of the ray parameter as the\nspatial derivative of travel time for the \"flat\" (Eq. 4.98) and spherical earth\n(Eq. 4.100)! Beware : For a flat earth the unit of ray parameter is s/km (or\ns/m), for the spherical earth it is either s/rad or just s or s/deg, so even though\nthe definitions are completely equivalent there are differences in units!\nWith the definition for the ray parameter in a spherical Earth (Eq. 4.99)\nwe can also get a simple expression that relates p to the minimum radius (or\nmaximum depth) along the ray path : this point is known as the turning or\nbottoming point of the ray. A \"turning ray\" is the spherical Earth equivalent\nof the \"head wave\" (see Fig. 4.12).\nrmin sin 90\nv(rmin)\n=\nrmin\nv(rmin) = p\n(4.101)\nUnder the assumption of a reference earth model for seismic wave speeds we\ncan determine the horizontal distance traveled by the ray (e.g., from 4.98) and\nthe depth to the turning point (from Eq. 4.101) once we know the ray parameter.\nBefore showing how the ray parameter can be determined from observed data,\nlet me mention another important concept based on the ray parameter :\n\n4.16. TRAVEL TIME CURVES AND RADIAL EARTH STRUCTURE\nTravel time curves\nEq. (4.98) indicates that the ray parameter, i.e. the horizontal slowness, can be\ndetermined from seismic data by determining the difference in travel time of a\nphase arrival at two adjacent stations. Ideally one uses an array of instruments\nto do this accurately.\nFigure 4.13: Determination of the ray with a seismometer array\nIn other words, one can determine the value of the ray parameter directly from\nthe travel time curve, which represents the variation of travel time as a function\nof distance : T (X) or T (∆). A travel time curve can be constructed by arrang-\ning observed records of ground motion due to the same explosion or earthquake\nas a function of distance. In such a record section the travel time curve of a\nparticular phase is just the curve that connect onset times of that phase in all\nrecords. One could also construct a travel time curve by using many measure-\nments, phase picks, of the travel time of particular phases, say the P-phase, at\ndifferent distances from the source. Seismologists try to find simple models of\nradial variations of wave speed that produce travel time curves consistent with\nthe observed data. \"Theoretical\" travel time curves in this sense are thus best\nfitting curves determined from some reference model of seismic wave speeds.\nWell known models for the Earth's depth dependent structure are the Pre-\nliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) by Dziewonski & Anderson\n(1981), and the more recent iasp91 model (Kennett & Engdahl, 1991). Typ-\nically, this fitting is not done by trial and error but by means of inversion of\neither the travel times or the travel time curves. A classical approach that is\ndiscussed in most text books is the one first applied by Herglotz and Wiechert\nin the beginning of this century. They were the first to invert travel time data\nfor simple radially stratified models of seismic wave speed, and their technique\nhas been used for decades. The first comprehensive model and the correspond-\ning travel time tables was published by Jeffreys & Bullen (1939/1940). In fact\ntheir model, known as the JB model, is still being used for routine earthquake\nlocation by the International Seismological Centre in the U.K.\nThe ray parameter of a seismic wave (group) arriving at a certain distance\ncan be thus be determined from the slope of the travel time curve. The straight\nline tangent to the travel time curve at ∆can be written as a function of the\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nintercept time σ and the slope p :\np = ∂T\n∂∆⇒T (∆) = σ + ∂T\n∂∆∆= σ + p∆\n(4.102)\nand this equation forms the basis of what is known as the σ -p method.\nFigure 4.14: Determination of the ray parameter from the travel-\ntime curve\nThe (local) slope of the travel time curve contains important information about\nthe horizontal slowness, and thus about the wave speed, and the intercept time\nσ, the zero offset time, contains information about the layer thickness. This\nproperty is exploited in exploration seismics, where we typically deal with travel\ntime \"curves\" that consist of segments of straight lines (see Fig. 4.14).\nAnother piece of information that can be obtained from travel time curves\nis contained in the second derivative of the travel time curve with distance, or\nthe variation of ray parameter with distance ∂p/∂∆. This quantity controls the\namplitude of the arrivals. To see this, consider a situation (that we will discuss\nin more detail below) in which rays with different incident angles at the source\n(and receiver) are somehow focused to travel to the same seismographic station\nso that the amplitude increases. In that case, δp = 0 but δ∆= 0 so\n∂p\n∂∆= ∂2T\n∂∆2 →inf\n(4.103)\nIn other words, the larger ∂p/∂∆, the more energy arrives at a small distance\nrange δ∆, and the higher the amplitude. In real life the amplitude of seismic\nwaves is always finite, and this reveals, in fact, one of the shortcomings of\nray theory.\nIf rays are assumed to be infinitesimally narrow the theoretical\namplitude can go to infinity, but in practice the amplitude remains finite as a\nresult of the interference of the waves that arrive at the same time.\n4.17\nRadial Earth structure\nIn a spherical earth we typically encounter three important situations that are\ncharacterized by the geometry of the ray paths, the travel time curves T (∆), the\nvariation of the ray parameter with distance p(∆), and the σ(p) curves. In the\nfollowing, just imagine what happens if you \"shoot\" rays from an earthquake\nsource at the surface to increasing distances. In other words, you start of with\n\n4.17. RADIAL EARTH STRUCTURE\nFigure 4.15: Case 1 : Wave speed monotonously increases with depth.\na large take-offangle and you analyze what happens when you decrease this\nangle (i.e. let the ray dive steeper into the Earth).\n1. The situation that applies to most depth ranges in the Earth's interior is\nthat of a steady increase in seismic wave speed (see Fig. 4.15) so that:\n- Ray paths : the rays sample progressively deeper regions in the Earth,\n- T (∆) : and arrive at progressively larger distances.\n- p(∆) : the slope of the travel time curves decrease monotonically with\nincreasing distance (i.e. the ray parameter decreases for waves travel-\ning to larger distances), so there are no significant changes in ampli-\ntude (other than those due to geometrical spreading!) (∂p/∂∆< 0).\n- the intercept time σ decreases with increasing ray parameter (de-\ncreasing distance!)\nA look at the travel time curves suggests that this situation is indeed very\ncommon and describes the overall character of the curves pretty well.\nFigure 4.16: Case : The presence of a low-velocity zone.\n2. The first important deviation from this situation is when there is a decrease\nin wave speed with increasing depth or decreasing radius (see Fig. 4.16).\nThis gives rise to some interesting effects.\n- Ray paths : The rays will still sample progressively deeper regions\nwhen the ray parameter decreases, but the pattern is more complex.\nInitially (i.e. above the depth where the wave speed drops) the be-\nhavior is the same as in the general situation above. However, when\nthe ray parameter decreases further the rays interact with the low\nvelocity zone. (A sufficient condition for the 'low velocity zone' is\nthat ∂v/∂r < v/r.) The decrease in wave speed results in the deflec-\ntion of the ray toward the vertical and the rays do not turn within\nthe low velocity zone; they only reflect back to the Earth's surface to\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nbe recorded by seismometers when the wave speed increases again.\nThe corresponding waves arrive significantly farther away from the\nsource than the ones with only a slightly less ray parameter. (You\ncan also say that here we have a situation where δp ≈0 but δ∆= 0\nso that the amplitude is zero.) Initially, some rays may reflect at the\ntop of the \"base\" of the low velocity zone so that energy is projected\nto shorter distances with a further decrease in ray parameter (inci-\ndence angle), but eventually, the effect of the low wave speed zone\nis no longer felt and the rays sample deeper regions and behave in a\nmanner similar to the general situation.\nIn terms of ray geometry : there will be a region in the Earth's interior\nthat is not sampled.\n- T (∆) : The travel time curve will reveal a shadow zone, a region\nwhere (according to our simplified - ray - theory based on the high\nfrequency approximation) no phases arrive. There will be a small\ndistance where two phases can arrive : the wave reflected from the\nbase of the low velocity zone and the direct arrival which is the wave\nthat turns beneath the LVZ.\n- p(∆) : Initially, p will decrease with increasing distance (∂p/∂∆< 0),\nand p(∆) is continuous. When p decreases so that the ray is refracted\nthrough the LVZ two things happen :\n(a) the p(∆) curve is no longer continuous since the ray defined by\nthe incrementally smaller p arrives at a different distance, and\n(b) with decreasing p the distance initially decreases because of the\nreflection (∂p/∂∆> 0). If p decreases even further the \"normal\"\nbehavior is established again (∂p/∂∆< 0).\n- Amplitude : The amplitude is zero in the shadow zone (the p -\n∆curve is horizontal), but becomes large for arrivals at a distance\njust outside the shadow zone corresponding to rays that bottom just\nbeneath the LVZ (the p -∆curve is vertical).\nThe two most important regions in the Earth where this happens are the\nlow velocity layer beneath oceanic lithosphere and at the transition from\nthe mantle to the outer core (for P-waves).\nFigure 4.17: Case 3 : A sharp increase in wave speed with depth.\n\n4.17. RADIAL EARTH STRUCTURE\n3. The second important deviation from the \"normal\" situation is when there\nis a region where the wave speed increases rapidly with increasing depth :\n∂v/∂r >> 1 (see Fig. 4.17). Let's for the discussion assume that the\nincrease in wave speed occurs instantly, i.e. that there is a seismic dis-\ncontinuity in ∂v/∂r (the function v(r) itself is - of course - continuous;\nthis situation is also known as a first order discontinuity), but you must\nrealize that similar effects occur when the gradient in wave speed is steep.\n- Ray paths : For large incidence angles the rays turn above the dis-\ncontinuity. These form the direct rays. When the incidence angle\n(or, equivalently, the ray parameter) decreases the rays will reflect at\nthe interface. The ray with the smallest ray parameter that does not\nreflect is called the grazing ray. The rays that are reflected from\nthe interface form arrivals at shorter distances those corresponding\nto the grazing ray. This leads to a situation where there is a distance\nrange where we have arrivals of both the direct and the reflected\nwaves. The situation is slightly more complicated because when the\nray parameter continues to decrease, there is a critical angle where\nthe rays no longer reflect but refract into the deeper earth. From\nthat point onward, the behavior of the rays is as one would expect\nfrom the \"normal\" situation, and the rays go to larger distances. The\nreflection will cause the ray paths to cross which causes a caustic\nand results in large amplitudes of the phase arrivals.\n- T (∆) : The corresponding travel time curve is complicated. In the\ndistance range between the arrival of the waves associated with the\ngrazing ray and the critical ray there are, in fact, three arrivals : the\ndirect phase propagating through the medium above the interface,\nthe reflected phase, and the refracted wave that propagates in part\nin the medium beneath the interface. This distance range it, there-\nfore, called the triplication range because there are, in fact, three\narrivals.\n- p(∆) : For large ray parameters the behavior is as in the standard sit-\nuation; a gradual increase in distance with decreasing p (∂p/∂∆< 0).\nWhen p becomes smaller than that of the grazing ray the reflection\ncauses the distance to decrease with decreasing p (∂p/∂∆> 0), but\nwhen p decreases further and becomes smaller than the for the critical\nray the distance increases again (∂p/∂∆< 0).\n- Amplitude : there are two points in the p(∆) curve where ∂p/∂∆be-\ncomes very large (in ray theory the slope can go to infinity!). These\ntwo points correspond to the ray parameter for the grazing and criti-\ncally refracted rays, respectively. Consequently, the amplitude of the\nphase arrival will be large on either end of the triplication range.\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nFinal remarks\nIt is clear that the τ -p curves are the only curves associated with travel time\ncurves that are continuous in all circumstances, and this is a very attractive\nproperty in, for instance, inversion of travel time information for Earth's struc-\nture. In fact, this curve also plays a central role in the computation of synthetic\nseismograms with the so-called WKBJ approximation.\nA significant body of research is based on the arrival times of first arriving,\ndirect phases such as P. In triplication zones there are typically more than two\narrivals; there can be as many as 5 when triplication zones due to discontinuities\nat different depths overlap. The identification problem is aggravated due to the\neffect of the caustics on the amplitude : near the cusps in the travel time curve\nthe later arriving triplication phases have significantly higher amplitude than\nthe first arrival and for small signal to noise ratio in the data (for instance when\nthere's a small earthquake) the first arrival that can be identified in the record\ncan, in fact, be a later arriving phase. This causes substantial scatter in the\narrival time data in these distance ranges.\nThe difficulty of phase identification in the triplications due to upper mantle\ndiscontinuities and the related uncertainty in the geometry of the ray paths\ninvolved has important implications for the imaging of upper mantle structure,\nwhich is more difficult than the imaging of lower mantle structure, and for the\naccurate location of earthquake hypocenters using these data.\nIn seismological literature one encounters the terms regional and teleseis-\nmic distances. The precise boundary between these distances is not well de-\nfined. It basically refers to the distance ranges where effects of an upper mantle\nlow velocity layer and the discontinuities are (regional) or are not (teleseismic)\nsignificant. Regional distance is the distance where the associated rays bottom\nin the upper mantle and transition zone (i.e. above 660 km depth) and this is\nabout 25*to 30*, with exact values dependent on the reference Earth model\nused. Teleseismic arrivals refer to arrivals beyond the triplication range and\nrefer to turning rays in the lower mantle.\nWhen waves pass through caustic (i.e. the arrivals on the receding branches\nof the travel time curves, for instance the PKPAB phase and the reflections off\na seismic discontinuity) the wave form will be distorted due to a 90*phase shift\nin the phase term iξ(r, t). This will cause additional complications in picking\nthe arrival time by hand. A better way is to generate synthetic waveforms that\nhave the same phase shifts and apply cross correlation techniques.\n\n4.18. SURFACE WAVES\n4.18\nSurface waves\nIntroduction\nWe have seen before that the solutions of the equations of motion in an un-\nbounded, homogeneous, isotropic medium are remarkably simple and that the\ntotal displacement field due to a stress imbalance is completely accounted for\nby propagating P and S-waves. We also discussed how this body wave field be-\ncomes increasingly complex in the presence of interfaces, for instance the Earth's\n(free) surface, and the first order seismic discontinuities such as the Moho, the\n410 and 660 km discontinuities, the CMB, and the ICB. The total P- and S-\ndisplacement field is then composed of up and downgoing SV and SH waves and\ntheir interaction is controlled by the reflection and transmission coefficients and\nby the boundary conditions at the interfaces.\nIn a bounded medium there is another important class of seismic waves,\nthe surface waves; these are caused by the interaction of body waves with the\nfree surface. Specifically, the interaction of the P-SV field with the free surface\nresults in Rayleigh waves (after Lord Rayleigh, 1842-1919) whereas the inter-\naction of the SH wave field with the free surface combines with internal layering\nto produce Love waves (after mathematician A. E. H. Love, 1843-1940, who\npredicted the existence of these waves in 1911). Later we will see that both\nthe body waves and the surface waves can be represented by -- and are equiva-\nlent with -- a superposition of the normal modes of free oscillation of the\nEarth and it is important to be aware of the intimate relationship between these\nseemingly separate descriptions of wave propagation in the Earth's interior (see\nTable 4.3). All body waves propagating in the Earth's interior have counterparts\nin both propagating surface waves or standing free oscillations. However, each\nrepresentation has distinct advantages for studying specific problems related to\nEarth's structure and the seismic source.\nBody waves\nSurface waves\nFree oscillations\nP-SV waves\nRayleigh waves\nSperoidal modes\nSH waves\nLove waves\nToroidal modes\nTable 4.3: Body waves, surface waves and free oscillation equivalencies.\nGeneral properties of surface waves\nSurface waves propagate along the Earth's surface. This seems like a rather\ntrivial statement but it has important implications for the amplitude of surface\nwaves.\nThe cylindrical expansion of the wave front of the waves along the Earth's\nsurface implies that the energy of surface waves decreases as 1 over r, with r the\ndistance between the source and the position of the wave front. The amplitude\nof surface waves, related to the square root of the energy, therefore falls of as 1\nover √r. In contrast, the geometrical spreading of body waves in the Earth's\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\ninterior implies that the energy decays as 1 over r2 so that the amplitude of\nbody waves decays as 1 over r.\nAs a result of the difference in geometrical\nspreading, the amplitude of surface waves is typically much larger than that of\nbody waves, in particular at larger distances from the source. (The distance\nfrom source to receiver is typically referred to as the epicentral distance).\nAnother implication of horizontal wave propagation and energy conservation\nis that surface waves are evanescent, i.e., the amplitude decays with increasing\ndepth and goes to zero for very large depths. As a rule of thumb: the (funda-\nmental mode of) surface waves are most sensitive at a depth z = λ/3, with λ the\nwave length, and their sensitivity becomes very small for z > λ. For example,\nat a period of T = 100s, the wavelength is about 450 km. Those waves are\nmost sensitive in the upper 180 km of the mantle (where the shear wave speed\nis about 4.5 km/s).\nThe fact that the amplitude of surface waves decays with depth as 1 over\nλ means that long wave length (or low frequency) waves are more sensitive to\ndeeper structure than high frequency waves. In combination with the fact that,\nin general, the wave speed changes with depth, this explains why surface waves\nare dispersive: surface waves of different frequency propagate with different\nwave speeds.\nDue to the dispersion, the wave form will change with increasing distance\nfrom the source so that it becomes less clear what is meant if one talks about\nthe velocity of surface waves; to understand dispersion it will be necessary to\nconsider two definitions of propagation velocity: group and phase velocity.\nThe surface waves are typically of substantially lower frequency than the\nbody waves. Owing to the low frequency (sometimes in the same range as the\neigenfrequencies of man made constructions) and their large amplitude, surface\nwaves typically cause most of the earthquake damage to buildings.\nRayleigh waves\nInterference between P and SV waves near the free surface4 causes a type of\ndisplacement known as Rayleigh waves. Since the SV wave speed β is smaller\nthan the P wave speed α there is an angle of incidence for an incoming SV wave\nthat produces a critically refracted P wave, which propagates horizontally along\nthe interface (see Fig. 4.18)\nIn other words, P-wave energy is trapped along the surface in a natural way,\ni.e., it does not require any particular wave speed variations at depth (Rayleigh\nwaves can, in principle, exist in a half space). To conserve energy the amplitude\nof the horizontally propagating P wave must decrease with depth and vanish at\nsome point, i.e., a critically refracted P wave is an evanescent wave.\n4The boundary condition at the free surface is that the traction on that surface vanishes.\nIt is convenient to take n3 as the direction normal to the Earth's surface, so that σ13 = σ23 =\nσ33 = 0 and T3 = σi3ni = 0\n\n4.18. SURFACE WAVES\nFigure 4.18: Free-surface interactions of an incident P and S wave.\nIntermezzo 4.4 Evanescent waves\nFrom analysis of a displacement potential φ it can be shown that the amplitude\nA(z) of a horizontally propagating, critically refracted P-wave decays with in-\ncreasing depth.\nConsider the potential\nφ = A(z)ei(k·r-ωt) = A(z)eiω(px+ηαz-t)\n(4.104)\nwith k the wave number vector and p and ηα the horizontal and vertical com-\nponents of the P-wave slowness. From the vector properties of the slowness it\nfollows that p2 + η2\nα = 1/α2. The horizontal slowness p (the ray parameter!),\nis constant for the entire wave field generated by the incoming SV wave, which\nhas a wave speed β < α. In the case that p = 1/c > 1/α then\nηα =\n\nα2 -p2 = i\n\np2 -1\nα2 = i ˆ\nηα\n(4.105)\nso that\nφ = B(z)eiω(px-t)e-ˆ\nηαωz\n(4.106)\nA similar expression can be given for the SV-wave, with ηβ instead of ηα.\nThe fact that the argument of the exponential component of the amplitude\nfactor is real has important implications for the admissible wave speeds. Since\nthe wave number ˆηω = kz is related to |k| = 2π/λ, with λ the wavelength,\nit also follows that the amplitude decay with depth is larger for small wave\nlengths than for long wave lengths, and this is of fundamental importance for\nthe understanding of the dispersion of surface waves.\n(NB the horizontally\npropagating, evanescent P-wave must interfere everywhere with SV-waves; this\ncan be achieved if there is an incoming SV-wavefield but for Rayleigh waves\nthe evanescent P-wave interferes with a horizontally propagating, and thus also\nevanescent, SV-wave.)\nAlong the interface the critically refracted P-wave exists simultaneously with\nthe incident SV-wave; in fact, the evanescent P-waves alone do not satisfy the\nstress-free boundary conditions and they cannot propagate along the interface\nwithout coupling to SV. The interference of P and SV-wave produces a particle\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nX3\nX3\nPI\nSvR\nSvI\nSvR\nPR\nPn\nX1\nX1\ni2\ni\ni1\nj1\nj2\nj\nα, β, p\nα, β, p\nFree Surface\nFree Surface\n\nCHAPTER 4.

This is similar to the particle motion\nin ocean waves.\nFigure 4.20: Elliptical particle motion for Rayleigh wave propagation.\nThe Rayleigh wave can thus be observed at both the vertical (in the direc-\ntion of z) and horizontal (radial, i.e., in the direction of x) components of the\ndisplacement field (see also Fig. 4.21).\nLove waves\nAnother type of surface wave, the Love wave, is formed by interaction of\nthe SH-wavefield and the free surface. In contrast to the critically refracted\nwaves that interfere to produce Rayleigh waves, there is no critical refraction of\nSH-waves (angle of incidence = angle of reflection) and in order to satisfy the\nboundary conditions there must be total reflection of the SH-waves at the free\nsurface. SH energy can thus not be trapped near the surface in a half space. In\norder for Love waves to exist SH energy has to be reflected back to the surface\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nλ\nDirection of wave propagation\nX3\nX3\nic = sin β\nα\nSVI\nSV\nSVR\nPR\nP\nX1\nX1\n-1\n\n4.18. SURFACE WAVES\nFigure 4.21: Love and Rayleigh wave displacement.\nby a wave speed gradient at some depth; there must be a layer over a half\nspace with the shear wave speed in the layer lower than in the half space. If\nthe shear wave speed increases with depth a wave guide is formed in which\nrays are multiply reflected between the free surface and the turning points of\nthe rays. In general, some energy may leak into the half space (if the form of\nSH body waves), unless the incoming SH-ray strikes the reflecting interface at\n(post) critical angles so that -- effectively --- a head wave is formed and all\nenergy is trapped within the wave guide (see Fig. 4.22). The headwave is also\nevanescent, and its amplitude decreases in with increasing depth beneath the\nlayer (see box).\nFigure 4.22: Trapped waves in the crust.\nSince Love waves are interfering SH-waves, the particle motion is purely\nhorizontal, in the x2, or y, direction. Wave guides formed by a low-wave speed\nlayer over a faster half space occur naturally in the Earth; the wave speed in the\ncrust is larger than that in the mantle beneath the Moho, and at larger depths\nthere can be a low velocity zone -- in particular beneath oceanic lithosphere --\nthat can cause efficient Love-wave propagation. Love waves are observed only\non the transverse component (parallel to x2) of the displacement field.\nPropagation speed\nFrom looking at data we can make an important observation: Love waves arrive\nbefore Rayleigh waves. Love waves propagate intrinsically faster than Rayleigh\nwaves, see below, but the difference is not large enough to explain the observed\nadvance of the Love wave arrival.\nSince Love waves involve only horizontal\ndisplacement whereas Rayleigh waves are composed of P-waves and vertically\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nLove wave\nRayleigh wave\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\npolarized SV-waves, the observed advance of the Love waves suggests a form of\nseismic anisotropy with faster wave propagation in the horizontal plane than\nin the vertical direction (a situation known as transverse isotropy).\nIt can be shown, using the information given in the box below, that for\nhorizontally propagating waves to be evanescent they must travel with a prop-\nagation velocity c that is always smaller than the compressional wave speed α,\nc = 1/p < α, and also smaller than the shear wave speed β, c = 1/p < β. If\n1/p →β the amplitude of the surface waves no longer decays with depth and\nconservation of energy is then achieved by the leaking of energy into the half\nspace in the form of body waves (SV in the case of Rayleigh waves and SH in\nthe case of Love waves). If this happens one speaks of leaky modes.\nSo Rayleigh waves always propagate with a speed that is lower than the\nshear wave speed. For a half space with shear wave speed β1, the propagation\nspeed of the Rayleigh wave is about 0.9β1. (In the Earth the situation is more\ncomplicated because of the radial variation of both P and S-wave speed: if the\nwave speed gradually increases with depth from c = β1 at the surface to c = β2\nin the half space: 0.9β1 < cRayleigh < 0.9β2). We will see below that the surface-\nwave propagation speed depends on the wave length, and thus on frequency, of\nthe wave (dispersion).\nFor Love waves it is slightly different.\nHere it's the\nhead wave that is evanescent; for high-frequency waves (short wavelengths) the\nevanescent head wave hardly penetrates into the half space (suppose a shear\nwave speed of β2) so that the propagation speed is dominated by SH-propagation\nin the layer over the half space (propagation speed c = β1). For longer period\nLove waves, the head wave is sensitive to as much larger depth range and the\npropagation speed gets closer to the shear wave speed in the half space (β2).\nThus: β1 < cLove < β2.\n4.19\nSensitivity kernels\nFor evanescent waves such as Rayleigh and Love waves we have seen that long\nwavelength waves penetrate deeper into the half space than short-wavelength\nwaves. As a rule of thumb, at a depth of 0.4 λ the amplitude is reduced to\n1/e of its value at the surface, and wave propagation is influenced by structure\nanywhere in this depth interval. How exactly structure in a certain depth in-\nterval influences a wave of a particular frequency is described by a sensitivity\nkernel. They represent the maximum partical motion at a certain depth as a\nfunction of frequency, which can be computed from a reference Earth model. A\nfew examples are given below.\nThese kernels are a sort of Green's functions and they are typically con-\nvolved with (a model of) Earth structure in order to synthesize observables such\nas waveforms. (Note: we have seen someting like this before: in travel time to-\nmography I mentioned that one solves the system of equations given by -- in\nmatrix notation -- Am = d, with m the model vector and d the data vector.\nThe matrix A contains the kernels and is therefore sometimes referreed to as\nthe sensitivity matrix. In the case of travel-time tomography the kernels, the\n\n4.20. EXCITATION OF SURFACE WAVES\nelements of A are simply the path length of a ray in a certain block.)\n4.20\nExcitation of surface waves\nFigure 4.23: Phase speed sensitivity kernels.\nFig. 4.23 can be used to understand in qualitative sense the excitation of\nsurface waves by earthquakes. In general, the position of the earthquake (i.e.\nthe depth in our case of depth-dependent media) determines which modes can\nbe excited. A fundamental mode has no displacement deeper than a certain\ndepth; by reciprocity, a source (assume a white spectrum of the source so that it\ncan -- in principle -- excite all frequencies) that is located at those large depth\nwill not cause displacement of that fundamental mode at the surface.\n4.21\nDispersion: phase and group velocity\nThe dependence of the depth of penetration on the period is described by the\nsensitivity kernels. If the wave speed is constant in the half space the waves\nassociated with different kernels travel with the same wave speed and thus arrive\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nat the same time at a receiver at some distance from the source. But if, as is\nthe case in Earth, the P and S-wave speed changes with depth, the longer\nperiod waves arrive at a different time than the shorter period waves. In Earth,\nthe propagation speed of Rayleigh waves is thus frequency-dependent, and the\nwaveform changes with increasing or decreasing distance from the source. This\nfrequency dependence of propagation speed is called dispersion. Love waves are\nalways dispersive since they cannot exist unless there is a layer over a half space,\nwith the shear wave speed in the half space larger than in the overlying layer.\nAs a result of dispersion the surface waveform changes with varying distance\nfrom the source, and it is clear that one can no longer describe the wave propaga-\ntion with a single wave speed. We describe the propagation velocity of the part\nof the waveform that remains constant, such as the onset of the phase arrrival,\na peak, or a trough (see discussion of plane waves) with the phase velocity\nc = ω/k. Wave packages with different frequencies travel at different velocities\nand their interference results in a phenomenon known as beating (see Interm):\nthe propagation velocity of the envelope, which is related to the energy, of the\nresulting wave train is called the group velocity U.\nPeaks or troughs in the wave form, or the onset of a particular phase arrival\nin the seismogram, all propagate with the phase velocity. In fact, we have\nseen this before when we discussed travel time curves of the body waves, which\ndepend on the phase velocity. The phase velocity can thus be measured directly\nfrom travel time curves (recall that the horizontal slowness p can be determined\nfrom the slope of the travel time curve at a certain distance).\nIn Fig. 4.25 the dashed lines through A, B, etc. are travel time curves for\nthose phases. But note that the frequency of those phases change with distance,\nso that the waveform changes. For instance, with increasing distance, the first\narriving phase (A) is composed of waves with larger frequencies (because they\nsample deeper).\nThe group velocity is constant for a given frequency (dω = 0).\nThus\nthe group velocity of surface waves of a particular frequency defines a straight\nline through the origin and through the signal of that particular frequency on\nrecords of ground motion at different distances. The group velocity decreases\nas the frequency increases.\nAs a result, high frequency phases become less\nand less pronounced with increasing distance from the source (or time in the\nseismogram).\nThe group velocity is very important: the energy in surface waves propagates\nmainly in the constructively interfering wave packets, which move with the group\nvelocity.\nNarrow-band filtering can isolate the wave packets with specific central fre-\nquencies (see Fig.4.26), and the group velocity for that frequency can then be\ndetermined by simply dividing the path length along the surface by the observed\ntravel time. This technique can be used for the construction of dispersion curves\n(see Sec. 4.22).\n\n4.22. DISPERSION CURVES\nIntermezzo 4.5 Group velocity\nConsider two harmonic waves with the same amplitude but slightly different\nfrequencies (ω1 and ω2), wave numbers k1 and k2, and phase velocities k1 =\nω1/c1 and k2 = ω2/c2 (see Fig. 4.24). These waves combine to give the total\ndisplacement\nu(x, t) = cos(k1x -ω1t) + cos(k2x -ω2t).\n(4.107)\nIf we define ω as the average between ω1 and ω2 so that ω1 + δω = ω =\nω2 ---δω, and k1 + δk = k = k2 ---δk, with δω ≪ω and δk ≪k, insert\nit into (4.107) and apply the cosine rule 2 cos x cos y = cos(x + y) + cos(x -y),\nwe obtain\nu(x, t) = 2 cos(kx -ωt) cos(δkx ---δωt)\n(4.108)\nThis is the product of two cosines, the second of which varies much more slowly\nthan the first. The second cosine 'modulates' the amplitude of the first. The\npropagation speed of this 'envelope' is given by U(ω) = δω/δk). In the limit as\nδω →0 and δk →0\nU(ω) = dω\ndk = c + k dc\ndk = c ---λ dc\ndλ\n(4.109)\nThe group velocity is related to interference of waves with slightly different phase\nvelocities; in other words U depends on c and on how c varies with frequency (or\nwavelength or wave number). In the earth dc/dλ > 0 so that the group velocity\nis typically smaller than the phase velocity.\nFigure 4.24: Two harmonic waves with the same amplitude but slightly differ-\nent frequencies. The resulting \"beating\" is visible in the lowermost trace.\n4.22\nDispersion curves\nWe have seen that the radial variation of shear wave speed causes dispersion\nof the surface waves. This means that the observed surface wave dispersion\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nA\nB\n0.5 sec\n0.5 sec\n1.5/5 = 0.3 sec\nU = 1.5 km/0.5 sec = 3 km/sec\n1.5/5.45 = 0.275 sec\nfB= 18 Hz\nCB= 5 km/sec\nfA= 16 Hz\nCA= 5.45 km/sec\nx = 0 km\nx = 1.5 km\nA'\nB'\nA' + B'\nsin ωt -\n)\n)\nω\nC x\nt\n0.5\n1 sec\nA+B\nt\n0.5\n1 sec\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nFigure 4.25: Group velocity windows and phase veclocity curves.\ncontains structural information about the radial variation of seismic properties.\nA plot of the group or phase velocity as a function of frequency is called a\ndispersion curve. Their diagnostic value of 1D structure has been explored in\ngreat detail. Typically, the curves produced from observed records are matched\nwith standard curves computed from an assumed reference Earth model that can\nhave a structure that is characteristic for a certain type of upper mantle (e.g.,\nold/young continents, old/young oceans, etc.). Such analyses have produced the\nfirst maps of the thickness of oceanic lithosphere which revealed the increase in\nthickness with increasing age of the lithosphere (or distance from the ridge),\nand also underlie the discovery of the Low Velocity Zone (LVZ) at a depth of\nabout 100 to 200 km beneath most oceans and beneath the younger parts of\ncontinents. Fig. 4.27 shows a variety of typical dispersion curves for different\ntectonic provinces.\n4.23\nSeismology: free oscillations\nLike any bounded medium, the Earth can \"ring like a bell\" and after occur-\nrence of a big earthquake it can oscillate in normal modes with discrete\n(eigen)frequencies. Normal modes of the Earth were predicted to exist in the\n\n4.23. SEISMOLOGY: FREE OSCILLATIONS\nFigure 4.26: Frequency-band filtering of seismograms.\nearly part of the 19th century when mathematicians (Poisson, Rayleigh) stud-\nied elastic wave propagation extensively. However, in absence of sensitive long-\nperiod seismometers the normal models of free oscillation of the Earth remained\nundetected until the Benioffstrain seismometer recorded the low-frequency sig-\nnal due to a great earthquake in Kamchatka (1952). With the global network of\nhighly sensitive broad-band seismometers many (many more than 1500) normal\nmodes have now been observed and identified.\nThe \"tone\" of the ringing contains information about the structure of the\nEarth's interior. Since the entire Earth is involved in the free oscillations, the\nnormal modes are more sensitive to average properties and whole-earth structure\nthan to local anomalies. Of particular relevance is also that the low-frequency\nwaves have to do work against gravity so that records of the modes contain in-\nformation about the density distribution within the Earth. For these reasons the\nnormal modes have played a central role in the development of global reference\nmodels for seismic properties.\nA second important implication of normal modes is that the displacement of\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nFigure 4.27: Dispersion curves for different tectonic provinces.\nany number of normal modes can be summed as a Fourier series, with certain\nweights for the different frequencies, in order to construct synthetic seismograms\n(a technique known as mode summation). In fact, body and surface-wave\npropagation can be simulated by superposition of a sufficient number of fun-\ndamental and higher modes. In the discussion of surface waves we considered\na \"flat\" Earth and an infinite half space (overlain, in case of Love waves, by a\nlow wave speed wave guide). This is only useful to derive some fundamental\nproperties, in particular at relatively short periods (T < 200s), but for long\nperiod surface waves , which penetrate deep into the Earth's interior and for\nthe interference of waves that have propagated along the circumference of the\nEarth, one must take sphericity into account. The surface waves were character-\nized by their frequency ω and wave number k. We did not consider boundaries\nof the medium other than the free surface, and the frequency was taken as the\nindependent variable: for each frequency there are only certain discrete wave\nnumbers k = kn(ω) for which the boundary conditions could be satisfied. In-\nstead we could have formulated the problem in terms of discrete eigenfrequencies\nω = ωn(k) with k the independent variable. This formalism makes more sense\nfor the discussion of free oscillations of the Earth, since the medium is bounded.\nIn the spherical geometry the \"horizontal wave number\" k is fixed at certain\ndiscrete values by the finite lateral extend of the medium. One often uses the\nangular wave number l instead of k, with l zero or a positive integer (see Fig.\n4.28).\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n1.0\nContinental Rayleigh\nMantle Rayleigh\nMantle Love\n(G Phase)\nOceanic Rayleigh\nSedimentary\nRayleigh\nSedimentary Love\nGroup Velocity (km/sec)\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\nPeriod (sec)\n40 50\nOceanic Love\nContinental\nLove\n\n4.23.

The first gives A = -B and C = -D.\nThe condition at x = L then gives\n(Aeiωt -Ce-iωt)2i sin\nωL\nc\n\n= 0\n(4.112)\nwhich has nontrivial solutions for ωL/c = (n + 1)π, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, · · ·inf.\nThese discrete frequencies, labeled ωn, are called the eigenfrequencies of this\nbounded system. The corresponding displacements, Eq. (4.110), are the eigen-\nfunctions or normal modes of the system and are of the form u = exp(iωnt) sin(ωnx/c).\nThe fundamental mode is given for n = 0, and has no internal nodes (where\nu = 0) within the system; n > 0 corresponds to higher modes or overtones,\nwhich have n internal nodes. It is important to realize that the motion of each\nof the modes occurs without horizontal motion of the nodes: they are stand-\ning waves and the modes themselves don't propagate horizontally. However,\nconstructive interference of the coexisting vibrations corresponds to traveling\nwaves. We have previously said that P and S-waves are the complete solutions\nto the wave equation, and it can be shown that the normals modes of free oscil-\nlations are, in fact, not fundamentally different from the body waves. Normal\nmodes can be used to describe body wave propagation. Indeed, any propagat-\ning disturbance can be represented by an infinite weighted sum of the eigen\nfrequencies (Fourier series!) so that normal mode summation can be used to\nsimulate propagating waves such as body waves and surface waves:\nu(x, t) =\ninf\n\nn=0\n\nAneiωnt + Bne-ωnt\n(4.113)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nCHAPTER 4. SEISMOLOGY\nFigure 4.29: A string under tension. Fundamental mode is given by n = 0; n\n= 1, 2, ... are the over tones.\nPower spectrum\nThe individual modes can, in general, not be observed directly from the seis-\nmograms. Free oscillations are studied with spectral techniques. If one was to\ntake a Fourier transform of a sufficiently long record of ground motion, typically\nmany hours or even days, one gets a power spectrum that reveals the distinct\neigenfrequencies of the Earth's free oscillations (see Fig. 4.30).\nNomenclature of normal modes\nNormal modes of free oscillation are just the solutions of the wave equation in\na spherical coordinate system and the nomenclature of the modes is therefore\nbased on spherical harmonics.\nRecall that the gravity and magnetic poten-\ntials were, in fact, summations of modes with different coefficients (Gaussian\ncoefficients in the case of the magnetic potential). The expression of mode sum-\nmation is similar to the spherical harmonic expressions used when we discussed,\nfor instance, the geoid and the magnetic field with two differences: (1) the nor-\nmalization of the harmonic coefficients are typically specific to each application\n(seismology, gravity, geomagnetism), but don't worry about that now, and (2)\ninstead of doing the summation from m = 0 to l with two (Gaussian) coeffi-\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nL\nn = 2\nn = 0\nn = 1\nX1\nX3\n\n4.23. SEISMOLOGY: FREE OSCILLATIONS\nFigure 4.30: Surface and nodal patterns of free oscillations.\ncients, in seismology one typically uses a notation that sums from m = -l to +l:\nin both cases there are 2l + 1 coefficients (this is called a 2l + 1 degeneracy).\nThere are two basic types of free oscillation (1) spheroidal modes, which\nare analogous to the P-SV-system and the Rayleigh waves and have a component\nof motion parallel to the radius from the Earth's center; and (2) toroidal or tor-\nsional modes involving shear motions parallel to the Earth's surface, analogous\nto SH and Love waves. Spheroidal modes involve expansion and contraction\nof (parts of) the Earth, whereas toroidal modes involve differential rotation of\nparts of the globe. Gravity does not influence the toroidal motion but long-\nperiod spheroidal oscillations do involve significant work against gravity; obser-\nvation of these modes can therefore yield information about the Earth's gross\ndensity structure.\nThe toroidal and spheroidal modes are labeled nTl and nSl , respectively,\nwhere n indicates the number of nodes along the radius of the Earth5 Torsional\nmodes are only sensitive to shear wave speed; spheroidal modes are sensitive\n5The latter would be true if the Earth was homogeneous and uniform; in reality it is more\ncomplicated. The behavior of normal modes in the Earth is complicated by stratification, the\nexistence of a fluid outer core, by the rotation of the sphere, and, of course, by deviations\nfrom sphericity (3D structure + anisotropy).\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n0S2\n0S0\n1S0\n0T2\n0T3\nn = 0\nn = 1\nn = 2\nn =3\n0S3\n0S4\nRADIAL MODES\nFundamental\nFirst Overtone\nSecond Overtone\nThird Overtone\nSURFACE PATTERNS\nRADIAL PATTERNS\nTOROIDAL MOTIONS\n\nCHAPTER 4.

The modes\nwith n = 0 sense the gross mantle structure, and the modes with increasing n\nare, in general, sensitive to elastic properties at different depths in the sphere.\nFor toroidal modes, the poles have no motion, counting as the l = 1 term. The\nmode 0T1 cannot exist. Spheroidal modes with l = 0 have no nodal planes at\nthe surface and are therefore sometimes called radial modes. The mode 0S0\ninvolves expansion and contraction of the sphere as a whole; mode 0S2 has two\nequatorial bands of zero displacement, 0S3 has three nodal lines etc. (see Fig.\n4.32).\nMode\nPeriod (s)\nMode\nPeriod (s)\n0S0\n1277.52\n0T2\n2636.38\n0S2\n3223.25\n0T10\n618.97\n0S15\n426.15\n0T20\n360.03\n0S30\n262.09\n0T30\n257.76\n0S45\n193.91\n0T40\n200.95\n0S60\n153.24\n0T50\n164.70\n0S150\n66.90\n0T60\n139.46\n1S2\n1470.85\n1T2\n756.57\n1S10\n465.46\n1T10\n381.65\n2S10\n415.92\n2T40\n123.56\nTable 4.4: Oscillation periods of some normal modes.\nTable 4.4 gives the periods of some of the observed modes.

In the last 4 decades many modes have been identified. This also is\na game of matching the observed spectra with model predictions, identifying\nthe modes, using that to improve the reference Earth models, and the improved\nstarting models may then allow the identification of previously unknown modes.\nNormal mode splitting: aspherical Earth's structure\nWe have used the notation of modes in terms of S and T and the degree l\nand the overtone number n, for instance 0S2. Just as in the use of spherical\nharmonics to describe the gravity and magnetic fields we also have the order m\nin seismology. (As a reminder: there are l nodal lines at the surface: there are\nm nodal lines along great circles (m=0 gives the zonal harmonics) and there\nare thus l -m nodal lines along latitude. For l = m: tesseral harmonics). For\neach angular degree l there are 2l + 1 values for m. In a spherically symmetric,\nnon-rotating body the 2l + 1 modes have the same eigenfrequency, the modes\ncorrespond to a single peak in the spectrum -- the overlapping peaks are known\nas multiplets -- and this redundancy is the reason why the superscript m is\nusually ignored in the notation. However, the 5 different modes that constitute\n0S2 have different angular moments and when the body is rotating the 2l + 1\npeaks, or singlets do not exactly overlap any more. This phenomenon is known\nas the splitting of the modes. The split modes have eigenfrequencies that are\nvery close together so that interference occurs.\nSplitting can be caused by rotation, but also by aspherical Earth's structure\nsuch as lateral variation in isotropic seismic properties (due to dynamic processes\nin the mantle) or by seismic anisotropy. Conversely, the analysis of splitting\nin the power spectra can give invaluable information about 3D structure and\nanisotropy."

The global heat flow can be measured by measuring the\ntemperature gradient everywhere at the surface of the Earth. This gives us an\nestimate of the mean rate of heat loss of the Earth, which can be broken up into\nvarious components (Table 7.3 in Fowler):\n2)\n-2)\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\nArea\nHeat Flow\nHeat Loss\n(km\n(mWm\n(1012 W)\nContinents\n11.5\nOceans\n30.4\nConductive cooling\n20.3\nHydrothermal circulation\n10.1\nTotal Earth\n41.9\nThe amount of heat lost through the ocean basins in enormous! -- up to 73%!\n(The oceans cover about 60% of the Earth's surface). This was a famous paradox\nbefore the discovery of plate tectonics. It was well known that the abundance\nof radioactive elements (which are a source of heat through radioactive decay)\nin the ocean basins was much lower than that in the continents. So what causes\nthe significantly higher heat flow in the oceans? With the discovery of plate\ntectonics it was realized that most of the heat loss occurs through the cooling\nand creation of oceanic lithosphere. The mean rate of plate generation therefore\ndepends on the balance between the rate of heat production within the Earth\nand the rate of heat loss at the surface.\nIn this course we will address some of the basic concepts of heat flow and\nEarth's thermal structure, and we will discuss in some detail the cooling of\noceanic lithosphere and the implications of Earth thermal structure for mantle\nconvection.\n\nCHAPTER 5. GEODYNAMICS\nHeat sources\nThere are several possibilities for the source of heat within the earth:\n1. \"Original\" or \"primordial\" heat; this is the release of heat due to the\ncooling of the Earth. The amount of heat released by this process can be\nestimated by calculating the heat released by a change in temperature of\n1* at constant pressure. This depends on the specific heat, CP which\nis the energy that is needed to heat up 1 kg of material by 1* (i.e., it's a\nmaterial property).\nWe can do a quick calculation to find out how much heat would be released\nby dropping the temperature of the mantle by 1*C (Let's for now ignore\nlatent heat due to phase changes):\n- Mantle; for silicates:CP = 7.1 × 102 Jkg-1*C-1; the mass of the\nmantle is about 4.1×1024 kg\n- Core; for iron: CP = 4.6 × 102 Jkg-1*C-1; the mass of the core is\nabout 1.9×1024 kg\nFor ΔT = 1*C this gives ΔE = 3.7×1027J. In absence of any other sources\nfor heat production, the observed global heat flux of 4.2×1013W can thus\nbe maintained by a cooling rate of 4.2×1013 [W] divided by 3.7×1027 [J]=\n1.1×10-14*Cs-1 .\nIn other words, since the formation of Earth, 4.5 Ga ago, the average\ntemperature would have dropped by ΔT ≈1, 500*C. Note that the actual\ncooling rate is much lower because there are sources of heat production.\n2. Gravitational potential energy released by the transfer of material from\nthe surface to depths. Imagine dropping a small volume of rock from the\ncrust to the core. The gravitational potential energy released would be:\nΔE = Δρgh, with g ≈10ms-2 and h = 3 × 106 m\nρsilicates ≈3×103 kgm-3 and ρiron ≈7×103 kgm-3, so that Δρ = 4×103\nkgm-3 .\nΔE ≈1.2 × 1011 Jm-3 .\nThe present-day heat flux would thus be equivalent to dropping a volume\nof about 350 m3 every second. This is equal to dropping a 22 m thick\nsurface layer every million years.\nSo even if a small amount of net differentiation were taking place within\nthe earth, this would be a significant source of heat!\n3. Radioactive decay: for an order of magnitude calculation, see Stacey 6.3.1.\nThe bottom line is that for the Earth a very significant fraction of heat\nloss can be attributed to radioactive decay (primarily of Uranium (U),\nThorium (Th) and Potassium (K). More, in fact, than can be accounted\nfor by heat production of the MORB source.\n\n5.1. HEAT FLOW\nHeat transfer\nThe actual cooling rate of the Earth depends not only on these sources of heat,\nbut also on the efficiency at which heat is transferred to and lost at the Earth's\nsurface.\nHow does heat get out of the system?\nConduction -- this will be discussed below in the context of the cooling of\noceanic lithosphere.\nConvection -- For example, in the mantle and core.\nRadiation -- most of the heat that the Earth receives from external sources\n(i.e. the Sun) is radiated out.\nRadiation\nThe net effect is that the Earth is cooling at a small rate (of the order of\n50-100*C per Ga!) (See Stacey (1993), p. 286.)\nFigure 5.1:\n\nCHAPTER 5. GEODYNAMICS\n5.2\nHeat flow, geothermal gradient, diffusion\nThe rate of heat flow by conduction across a thin layer depends on\n1. the temperature contrast across the layer (ΔT )\n2. the thickness of the layer (Δz)\n3. the ease with which heat transfer takes place (which is determined by\nthe thermal conductivity k). The thinner the layer and the larger the\ntemperature contrast (i.e., the larger the gradient in temperature), the\nlarger the heat flow.\nIn other words, the heat flow q at a point is proportional to the temperature\ngradient at that point. This is summarized in Fourier's Law of conduction:\nΔT\nq =\nˆ\n(5.1)\nz\n-k∇T ≈-k Δz\nwhere the minus sign indicates that the direction of heat flow is from high\nto low tempertaures (i.e., in the opposite dirtection of z if z is depth.). (For\nsimplicity we talk here about a 1D flow of heat, but Fourier's Law is also true\nfor a general 3D medium).\nWe can use this definition to formulate the conduction (or diffusion) equa-\ntion, which basically describes how the temperature per unit volume of material\nchanges with time. This change depends on\n1. the amount of heat that flows in or out of the system which is described\nby the divergence of heat flow\n2. the amount of heat produced within the volume (denoted by the density\nof heat sources A)\n3. the coupling between this change in heat and a change in temperature\n(which is controlled by the specific heat)\nThe thermal diffusion equation is given by:\n∂T\nρCP\n= -∇ · q + A\n(5.2)\n∂t\nOr: the change in heat content with time equals the divergence of the heat\nflow (into and out of the volume) and the generation of heat within the volume.\nCombined with Fourier's Law the diffusion equation can be written as\n∂T\nρCP\n= -∇ · (-k∇T ) + A = k∇ 2T + A\n(5.3)\n∂t\nIn a situation of steady-state the diffusion equation transforms to the ex-\npression of the geotherm, the variation of temperature with depth in the Earth:\n∂T\nA\n+ A = ρCP\n=\n=\n(5.4)\nk∇ 2T\n∂t\n0 ⇒∇ 2T\n-k\n\n5.2. HEAT FLOW, GEOTHERMAL GRADIENT, DIFFUSION\nIf there is no heat production (by radioactive decay), i.e., A = 0, then\nthe temperature increases linearly with increasing depth. If A = 0 then the\ntemperature/depth profile is given by a second-order polymomial in z. In other\nwords, the curvature of the temperature-depth profile depends on the amount\nof heat production (and the conductivity).\nFigure 5.2: Heat production causes nonlinear geotherms.\nA typical value for the geotherm is of order 20 Kkm-1, and with a value\nfor the conductivity k = 3.0 Wm-1K-1 this gives a heat flow per unit area of\nabout 60 mWm-2 (which is close to the global average, see table above). If the\ntemperature increases according to this gradient, at a depth of about 60 km a\ntemperature of about 1500 K is reached, which is close to or higher than the\nmelting temperature of most rocks. However, we know from the propagation\nof shear waves that the Earth's mantle behaves as a solid on short time scales\n(μ > 0). So what is going on here? Actually, there are two things that are\nimportant:\n1. At some depth the geothermal gradient is no longer controlled by con-\nductive cooling and adiabatic compression takes over. The temperature\ngradient for adiabatic compression (i.e., the change of temperature due\nto a change of pressure alone, without exchange of heat with its invi-\nronment) is much smaller than the gradient in the conducting thermal\nboundary layer.\n2. With increasing pressure the temperature required for melting also in-\ncreases. In fact it can be shown that with increasing depth in Earth's\nmantle, the actual temperature increases (from about 0*C at the sur-\nface to about 3,500 ± 1000*C at the core-mantle boundary CMB) but\nthe melting temperature Tm increases even more as a result of the in-\ncreasing pressure. Consequently, at increasing depth in the mantle the\nratio of T over Tm (the homologous temperature) decreases. At even\nlarger depth, in Earth's core, the temperature continues to increase, but\nthe melting temperature for pure iron drops (pure chemical compounds\n-- such as pure iron -- typically have a lower melting temperature then\n\nCHAPTER 5. GEODYNAMICS\nmost mixtures -- such as silicate rock) so that the actual temperaute ex\n-\nceeds the melting temperature and the material is in liquid state. Even\ntough the mantle is 'solid' it behaves as highly viscous fluid so that flow\nis possible over very long periods of time.\n(\n)\n(\n)\nA\nL\n(K)\n( o C)\n(\n)\nL = Lithosphere 0-80 km\nA = Asthenosphere 80-220 km\nD'' = Lower-Mantle D'' Layer\n400, 670 = Phase Transitions\nD''\nTemperature\nSolidus\nTemperature\nTemperature\nLower Mantle\nDepth km\nOuter Core\nInner\nCore\nFigure 5.3: Geotherms in the Earth.\nIf we ignore heat production by radioactive decay we can simplify the con-\nduction equation to\nρCP\n∂T\n∂t = k∇ 2T ⇒ ∂T\n∂t =\nk\nρCP\n∇ 2T = κ∇ 2T\n(5.5)\nwith κ the thermal diffusivity\nk\nκ = ρCP\n(5.6)\nWe will look at solutions of the diffusion equation when we discuss the cooling\nof oceanic lithosphere after its formation at the mid oceanic ridge.

Similarly, it takes a time l2/κ for a temperature\nchange to propagate over a distance l.\n5.3\nThermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere\nIntroduction\nThe thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere can be constrained by the\nobservations of:\n1. Heat flow\n2. Topography (depth of the ocean basins)\n3. Gravity (density depends inversely on temperature)\n4. Seismic velocities (μ = μ(T ), λ = λ(T )); in particular, surface waves are\nsensitive to radial variations in wave speed and surface wave dispersion\nis one of the classical methods to constrain the structure of oceanic (and\ncontinental) lithosphere.\nIn the following we address how the heat flow and the depth of ocean basins\nis related to the cooling of oceanic lithosphere.\nThe conductive cooling of oceanic lithosphere when it spreads away from the\nmid-oceanic ridge can be described by the diffusion equation\n∂T = κ∇ 2T + A\n(5.8)\n∂t\nWe will simplify this equation by (1) ignoring the heat production by ra-\ndiocative decay, so that A = 0 (this is reasonable for the oceanic lithosphere\nsince the basalts do not contain a significant fraction of major radio-isotopes\nUranium, Potassium, and Thorium)1, and (2) by assuming a 2D geometry so\nthat we can ignore the variations in the y direction. The latter assumption is\njustified for regions away from fracture zones. With these simplifications the\ndiffusion equation would reduce to a\n\n∂2T\n∂T\n∂2T\n= κ∇ 2T = κ\n+\n(5.9)\n∂t\n∂x2\n∂z2\n\nCHAPTER 5. GEODYNAMICS\nwith z the depth below the surface and x the distance from the ridge. The\nvariation in temperature in a direction perpendicular to the ridge (i.e., in the\nspreading direction x) is usually much smaller than the vertical gradient. In that\ncase, the heat conduction in the x direction can be ignored, and the cooling of\na piece of lithosphere that moves along with the plate, away from the ridge, can\nbe described by a 1D diffusion equation:\n∂2T\n∂T = κ\n(5.10)\n∂t\n∂z2\n(i.e., the 'observer', or the frame of reference, moves with the plate velocity\nu = x/t). Note that, in this formulation, the time plays a dual role: it is used\nas the time at which we describe the temperature at some depth z, but this also\nrelates to the age of the ocean floor, and thus to the distance x = ut from the\nridge axis).\nx\ny\nTm\ns\nu\nu\nT = T\nSURFACE\nASTHENOSPHERE\nLITHOSPHERE\nISOTHERM\nRidge\nx = 0\nFigure 5.4: The cooling of oceanic lithosphere.\ns\nm\nx\nu\nq\nq\nq\nu\nu\nu\nT = T\nT = T\nt =\nt = 0\nRidge\nt = t\nt = t\nFigure 5.5: Bathymetry changes with depth.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n5.3. THERMAL STRUCTURE OF THE OCEANIC LITHOSPHERE 199\nThe assumption that the oceanic lithosphere cools by conduction alone is\npretty good, except at small distances from the ridge where hydrothermal cir-\nculation (convection!) is significant. We will come back to this when we discuss\nheat flow. There is a still ongoing debate as to the success of the simple cooling\nmodel described below for large distances from the ridge (or, equavalently, for\nlarge times since spreading began). This is important since it relates to the\nscale of mantle convection; can the cooling oceanic lithosphere be considered as\nthe Thermal Boundary Layer (across which heat transfer occurs primarily by\nconduction) of a large scale convection cell or is small scale convection required\nto explain some of the observations discussed below?

Note that even though the plate is moving and the resultant geometry\nis two dimensional the half space cooling model works for an observer that is\nmoving along with the plate.

THERMAL STRUCTURE OF THE OCEANIC LITHOSPHERE 203\nIntermezzo 5.1 lithospheric thickness from surface wave\ndispersion\nIn the seismology classes we have discussed how dispersion curves can be used\nto extract information about lithospheric structure from the seismic data. The\nthickness of the high wave speed 'lid', the structure above the mantle low ve-\nlocity zone, as determined from surface wave dispersion across parts of oceanic\nlithosphere of different age appears to plot roughly between the 900* and 1100*C\nisotherms, or at about T = 0.8-0.9Tm (see Figure 5.10). So the seismic \"litho-\nsphere\" seems to correspond roughly to thermal lithosphere. In other words; in\nshort time scales -- i.e. the time scale appropriate for seismic wave transmission\n(sec - min) -- most of the thermal lithosphere may act as an elastic medium,\nwhereas on the longer time scale the stress can be relaxed by steady state creep,\nin particular in the bottom half of the plate. However, a word of caution is in or-\nder since this interpretation of the dispersion data has been disputed. Anderson\nand co-workers argue (see, for instance, Anderson & Regan, GRL, vol. 10, pp.\n183-186, 1983) that interpretation of surface wave dispersion assuming isotropic\nmedia results in a significant overestimation of the lid thickness.\nThey have\ninvestigated the effects of seismic anisotropy and claim that the fast isotropic\nLID extends to a much cooler isotherm, at T ∼ 450* - 600*C, than the base of\nthe thermal lithosphere.\nHeat flow\nIf we know the temperature at the surface we can deduce the heat flow by\ncalculating the temperature gradient:\n∂T\n∂T ∂η\nq\n=\n-k ∂z = -k ∂η ∂z\n=\n-\nk\n√\nκt\n∂\n∂η (Tm -Ts) erf(η) = - k(Tm -Ts)\n√\nκt\n∂\n∂η erf(η)\n(5.14)\nwith\nη\n∂\n∂\nerf(η)\n=\n∂η √π\ne-u du\n∂η\nη\n∂\n=\n√π ∂η\ne-u du =\n2 e-η2\n(5.15)\n√π\nso that\nq = -k (Tm -Ts) e-η2\n(5.16)\n√\nπκt\n\nCHAPTER 5.

In old oceanic basins the\nheat flow seems to level off at around 46 mW/m2, which suggests that beyond\na certain age of the lithosphere the rate of conductive cooling either becomes\nsmaller or the cooling is partly off set by additional heat production. Possible\nsources of heat which could prevent the half-space cooling are:\n1. radioactivity (A is not zero!)\n2. shear heating\n3. small-scale convection below plate\n4. hot upwelings (plumes)\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nCHAPTER 5. GEODYNAMICS\nIntermezzo 5.2 Plate-cooling Models\nThere are two basic models for the description of the cooling oceanic lithosphere,\na cooling of a uniform half space and the cooling of a layer with some finite\nthickness. The former is referred to as the half-space model (first described\nin this context by Turcotte and Oxburgh, 1967); The latter is also known as the\nplate model (first described by McKenzie, 1967).\nBoth models assume that the plate moves as a unit, that the surface of the\nlithosphere is at an isothermal condition of 0*C, and that the main method of\nheat transfer is conduction (a good assumption, except at the ridge crest). The\nmajor difference (apart from the mathematical description) is that in the half-\nspace model the base of the lithosphere is defined by an isotherm (for instance\n1300*C) so that plate thickness can grow indefinitely whereas in the plate model\nthe plate thickness is limited by some thickness L.\nThe two models give the same results for young plates near the ridge crest, i.e.\nthe thickness is such that the \"bottom\" of the lithosphere is not yet \"sensed\".\nHowever, they differ significantly after 50 Myr for heat flow predictions and 70\nMyr for topography predictions. It was realized early on that at large distances\nfrom the ridge (i.e., large ages of the lithosphere) the oceans were not as deep\nand heat flow not as low as expected from the half-space cooling model (there\ndoes not seem to be much thermal difference between lithosphere of 80 and 160\nMyr of age). The plate model was proposed to get a better fit to the data, but\nits conceptual disadvantage is that it does not explain why the lithosphere has\na maximum thickness of L. The half space model makes more sense physically\nand its mathematical description is more straightforward. Therefore, we will\ndiscuss only the half space cooling model, but we will also give some relevant\ncomparisons with the plate model.\n5.4\nThermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere\nBathymetry\nThe second thermal effect on the evolution of the cooling lithosphere is its\nsubsidence or the increase in ocean depth with increasing age. This happens\nbecause when the mantle material cools and solidifies after melting at the MOR\nit is heavier than the density of the underlying mantle. Since we have seen that\nthe plate thickens with increasing distance from the MOR and if the plate is\nnot allowed to subside this would result in the increase in hydrostatic pressure\nat some reference depth. In other words the plate would not be in hydrostatic\nequilibrium. But when the lithosphere subsides, denser material will be replaced\nby lighter water so that the total weight of a certain column remains the same.\nThe requirement of hydrostatic equilibrium gives us the lateral variation in\ndepth to the ocean floor.\nApplication of the isostatic principle gives us the\ncorrect ocean floor topography.\nLet ρw and ρm represent the density of water (ρw ∼1000 kg/m3) and the\nmantle/asthenosphere (ρm ∼3300 kg/m3), respectively, and ρ(z, t) the density\nas a function of time and depth within the cooling plate.\nThe system is in\nhydrostatic equilibrium when the total hydrostatic pressure of a column under\nthe ridge crest at depth w + zL is the same as the pressure of a column of the\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\n5.4.

The lithosphere is thus heavier\nthan the underlying half space! (Assuming, as we do here, that the lithosphere\nhas the same composition as the asthenosphere).

THERMAL STRUCTURE OF THE OCEANIC LITHOSPHERE 209\ndiscussions it is fair to say that these models have been very successful in pre-\ndicting heat flow, topography, gravity, and have thus played a major role in\nthe understanding of the evolution of oceanic lithosphere with time. The typi-\ncal game that is played by such successful theoretical models, in particular ones\nthat are so simple (= easy + fast to compute) as the cooling models is to predict\nthe first order behavior of a certain process and take out that trend from the\nobserved data. In this case, the residual signal is then analyzed for deviations\nfrom the simple conduction model. The addition of heat to the system (for in-\nstance by plumes) could cause anomalous topography (\"thermal topography\")\nwhereas the effect of deep dynamic processes in the Earth's mantle can cause\n\"dynamic topography\". Removing the effects of conduction alone thus helps to\nisolate the structural signal due to other processes. This is likely to continue,\nperhaps with the new model (GHD1) by Stein & Stein (1992) instead of that\nby earlier workers; since regional differences are often larger than the residual\nbetween observed and predicted heat flow and depth curves one could question\nhow useful a (set of) simple model(s) is (are). For instance, if one allows the\nthermal expansion coefficient as a free parameters in the inversions, one might\nalso look into allowing lateral variation of this coefficient. Davies and Richards\nargue that the success of the cooling models in predicting the topography and\nheat flow over almost the entire age range of oceanic lithosphere (they attribute\nthe deviations to the choice of the wrong sites for data -- which is rather ques-\ntionable) indicates that conductive cooling is the predominant mode of heat loss\nof most of the lithosphere (about 85% of the heat lost from the mantle flows\nthrough oceanic lithosphere), which suggests that the lithosphere is the bound-\nary layer of a convective system with a typical scale length defined by the plates\n(plate-scale flow). They follow up on a concept tossed up by Brad Hager that\nthe oceanic lithosphere organizes the flow in the deeper mantle. It is for argu-\nments such as these that question as to whether or not the topography levels\noff after, say, 80Ma, in not merely of interest to statisticians. It is quite clear\nthat the details of the bathymetry of the oceans still contain significant keys to\nthe understanding of dynamic processes in the deep interior of the Earth. One\nof the remarkable aspects of the square root of time variation of ocean depth is\nthat it does a very good job in describing the true bathymetry, even at distances\npretty close to the MORs. This indicates that conduction alone is likely to be\nthe predominant mode of heat loss, even close to the MOR. The absence of any\nsubstantial dynamic topography near the ridge crest suggests that the active,\nconvection related upwellings are not significant. The upwelling is \"passive\": the\nplates are pulled apart (mainly as the result of the gravitational force, the slab\npull, acting on the subducting slabs) and the asthenospheric mantle beneath\nthe ridges flows to shallower depth to fill the vacancy. In doing so the material\nwill cross the solidus, the temperature at which rock melts (which decreases\nwith decreasing depth) so that the material melts. This process is known as de-\ncompression melting (see Turcotte & Schubert, Chapter 1), which results in\na shallow magma chamber beneath the MOR instead of a very deep plume-like\nconduit.\n\nCHAPTER 5.

In other words, it forms a gravitationally unstable layer. Why does it\nstay atop the asthenosphere instead of sinking down to produce a more stable\ndensity stratification? That is because upon cooling the lithosphere also acquires\nstrength. Its weight is supported by its strength; the lithosphere can sustain\nlarge stresses before it breaks. The initiation of subduction is therefore less\ntrivial than one might think and our understanding of this process is still far\nfrom complete.\nThe strength of the lithosphere has important implications:\n1. it means that the lithosphere can support loads, for instance by seamounts\n2. the lithosphere, at least the top half of it, is seismogenic\n3. lithosphere does not simply sink into the mantle at trenches, but it bends\nor flexes, so that it influences the style of deformation along convergent\nplate boundaries.\nInvestigation of the bending or flexure of the plate provides important in-\nformation about the mechanical properties of the lithospheric plate. We will see\nthat the nature of the bending is largely dependent on the flexural rigidity,\nwhich in turn depends on the elastic parameters of the lithosphere and on the\nelastic thickness of the plate.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nP\nP\n5.5. BENDING, OR FLEXURE, OF THIN ELASTIC PLATE\nAn important aspect of the derivations given below is that the thickness\nof the elastic lithosphere can often be determined from surprisingly simple ob-\nservations and without knowledge of the actual load. In addition, we will see\nthat if the bending of the lithosphere is relatively small the entire mechanical\nlithosphere behaves as an elastic plate; if the bending is large some of the de-\nformation takes place by means of ductile creep and the part of the lithosphere\nthat behaves elastically is thinner than the mechanical lithosphere proper.\n5.5.1\nBasic theory\nTo derive the equations for the bending of a thin elastic plate we need to\n1. apply laws for equilibrium: sum of the forces is zero and the sum of all\nmoments is zero:\nF = 0 and\nM = 0\n2. define the constitutive relations between applied stress σ and resultant\nstrain o\n3. assume that the deflection w ≪L, the typical length scale of the system,\nand h, the thickness of the elastic plate ≪L. The latter criterion (#3) is\nto justify the use of linear elasticity.\nFigure 5.14: Deflection of a plate under a load.\nIn a 2D situation, i.e., there is no change in the direction of y, the bending\nof a homogeneous, elastic plate due to a load V (x) can be described by the\nfourth-order differential equation that is well known in elastic beam theory in\nengineering:\nd4w\nd2w\nD\n+ P\n= V (x)\n(5.28)\ndx4\ndx2\nwith w = w(x) the deflection, i.e., the vertical displacement of the plate,\nwhich is, in fact, the ocean depth(!), D the flexural rigidity, and P a horizontal\nforce.\nThe flexural rigidity depends on elastic parameters of the plate as well as on\nthe thickness of the plate:\nEh3\nD = 12(1 -ν2)\n(5.29)\n\nZ\nCHAPTER 5. GEODYNAMICS\nwith E the Young's modulus and ν the Poisson's ratio, which depend on the\nelastic moduli μ and λ (See Fowler, Appendix 2).\nThe bending of the plate results in bending (or fiber) stresses within the\nplate, σxx; depending on how the plate is bent, one half of the plate will be in\ncompression while the other half is in extension. In the center of the plate the\nstress goes to zero; this defines the neutral line or plane. If the bending is not\ntoo large, the stress will increase linearly with increasing distance z′ away from\nthe neutral line and reaches a maximum at z′ = ±h/2. The bending stress is\nalso dependent on the elastic properties of the plate and on how much the plate\nis bent; σxx ∼elastic moduli ×z′ × curvature, with the curvature defined as the\n(negative of the) change in the slope d/dx(dw/dx):\nEh3\nd2w\nσxx =\n(5.30)\n-1 -ν2 z′\ndx2\ny\nα\nα\nh\nM\nx\nM\nxx\nxx\ny = 0\next\ncomp\nFigure 5.15: Curvature of an elastic plate.\nThis stress is important to understand where the plate may break (seis-\nmicity!) with normal faulting above and reverse faulting beneath the neutral\nline.\nThe integrated effect of the bending stress is the bending moment M,\nwhich results in the rotation of the plate, or a plate segment, in the x-z plane.\n- h\nM =\nσxxz′ dz′\n(5.31)\nh\nEquation (5.28) is generally applicable to problems involving the bending of\na thin elastic plate.

BENDING, OR FLEXURE, OF THIN ELASTIC PLATE\nof seismicity. In class we will look at two important cases: (1) loading by sea\nmounts, and (2) bending at the trench.\nBefore we can do this we have to look a bit more carefully at the dynamics of\nthe system. If we apply bending theory to study lithospheric flexure we have to\nrealize that if some load V or moment M causes a deflection of the plate there\nwill be a hydrostatic restoring force owing to the replacement of heavy mantle\nmaterial by lighter water or crustal rock. The magnitude of the restoring force\ncan easily be found by applying the isostasy principle and the effective load is\nthus the applied load minus the restoring force (all per unit length in the y\ndirection): V = Vapplied -Δρwg with w the deflection and g the gravitational\nacceleration. This formulation also makes clear that lithospheric flexure is in fact\na compensation mechanism for isostasy! For oceanic lithosphere Δρ = ρm -ρw\nand for continental flexure Δρ = ρm -ρc.

GEODYNAMICS\nImportant implications: The flexural parameter can be determined from\nthe location of either the zero crossing or the location of the forebulge. No need\nto know the magnitude of the load! The depression is narrow for small α, which\nmeans either a weak plate or a small elastic thickness (or both); for a plate with\nlarge elastic thickness, or with a large rigidity the depression is very wide. In\nthe limit of very large D the depression is infinitely wide but the amplitude w0,\nis zero ⇒ no depression at all! Once α is known, information about the central\nload can be obtained from Eq. (5.37)\nNote: the actual situation can be complicated by lateral variations in thick-\nness h, fracturing of the lithosphere (which influences D), compositional layering\nwithin the elastic lithosphere, and by the fact that loads have a finite dimensions.\nFlexure at deep sea trench\nWith increasing distance from the MOR, or with increasing time since formation\nat the MOR, the oceanic lithosphere becomes increasingly more dense and if the\nconditions are right5 this gravitational instability results in the subduction of the\nold oceanic plate. The gravitational instability is significant for lithospheric ages\nof about 70 Ma and more. We will consider here the situation after subduction\nitself has been established; in general the plate will not just sink vertically into\nthe mantlebut it will bend into the trench region.\nwb\nb\nx\nx = x\nx = x\nx = 0\n-V\n-M\nFigure 5.19:\nThis bending is largely due to the gravitational force due to the negative\nbuoyancy of the part of the slab that is already subducted M0. For our modeling\n5Even for old oceanic lithosphere the stresses caused by the increasing negative buoyancy\nof the plate are not large enough to break the plate and initiate subduction. The actual cause\nof subduction initiation is still not well understood, but the presence of pre-existing zones of\nweakness (e.g. a fracture zone, thinned lithosphere due to magmatic activity -- e.g. an island\narc) or the initiation of bending by means of sediment loading have all been proposed (and\ninvestigated) as explanation for the triggering of subduction.\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\nn\no\n\n5.5. BENDING, OR FLEXURE, OF THIN ELASTIC PLATE\nwe assume that the bending is due to an end load V0 and a bending moment\nM0 applied at the tip of the plate. As a result of the bending moment the slope\ndw/dx = 0 at x = 0 (note the difference with the seamount example where this\nslope was set to zero!). The important outcome is, again, that the parameter\nof our interest, the elastic thickness h, can be determined from the shape of the\nplate, in vertical cross section, i.e. from the bathymetry profile w(x)!, in the\nsubduction zone region, without having to know the magnitudes of V0 and M0.\nWe can use the same basic equation (5.33) and the general solution (5.34)\n(with A = B = 0 for the reason given above)\nx\nx\nw(x) = e- x\nα\nC cos\n+ D sin\n(5.38)\nα\nα\nbut the boundary conditions are different and so are the constants C and\nD. At x = 0 the bending moment6 is -M0 and the end load -V0. It can be\nshown (Turcotte & Schubert) that the expressions for C and D are given by\nα2\nM0α2\nC = (V0α + M0)\nand\nD =\n(5.39)\n2D\n- 2D\nso that the solution for bending due to an end load and an applied bending\nmoment can be written as\nα2e-x/α n\no\nx\nx\nw(x) =\n(V0α + M0) cos α -M0 sin\n(5.40)\n2D\nα\nWe proceed as above to find the locations of the first zero crossing and the\nfore bulge, or outer rise.\nw(x) = 0\n⇒\ntan(x0/α) = 1 + αV0/M0\n(5.41)\ndw/dx = 0\n⇒\ntan(xb/α) = -1 -2M0/αV0\n(5.42)\nIn contrast to similar solutions for the sea mount loading case, these ex-\npressions for x0 and xb still depend on V0 and M0.\nIn general V0 and M0\nare unknown. They can, however, be eliminated, and we can show the depen-\ndence of w(x) on x0 and xb, which can both be estimated from the nathymetry\nprofile. A perhaps less obvious but elegant way of doing this is to work out\ntan(1/α(x0 -xb)). Using sine and cosine rules (see Turcotte & Schubert, 3.17)\none finds that\nx0\ntan\nxb -\n= 1\n(5.43)\nα\nso that x0 -xb = (π/4 + nπ)α, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . For n = 0 one finds that\nα = 4(x0 -xb)/π, so that the elastic thickness h can be determined if one can\nmeasure the horizontal distance between x0 and xb.\n6At this moment, it is important that you go back to the original derivation of the plate\nequation in Turcotte & Schubert and realize they obtained their results with definite choices\nas to the signs of applied loads and moments -- hence the negative signs.\n\nCHAPTER 5.

Both in the\noverriding plates as well as in the subducting plate. The latter can be attributed\nto the bending stresses in the plate. The bending stress is given by Eq. (5.30).\nEarthquakes are most likely to occur in the region where the bending stress is\nlargest (that's the place where the elastic plate is most likely to fail if there are\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n5.6. THE UPPER MANTLE TRANSITION ZONE\nno pre-existing inhomogeneities such as transform faults). To find the horizontal\nlocation where the stress is largest we must solve\ndσxx\nd\nd2w\nd3w\n= 0\n= 0 =\n(5.45)\ndx\n⇒\ndx\ndx2\ndx3\nThis gives the location x where the stress is a maximum (or minimum!) and\nsubstitution in (5.30), with the flexural parameter D determined as above from\nthe bathymetry profile, then gives the amplitude of the maximum stress. If this\nstress exceeds the strength of the plate, failure will occur. The mechanism of\nthe earthquake depends on the location relative to the neutral stress plane.\n5.6\nThe upper mantle transition zone\nDerivation of density variation with depth :\nAdams-Williamson Equation\nHow about density? Can the radial variation in density and the elastic moduli\nbe constrained independently from the travel time curves? Indirectly, yes! This\nwas first shown by Adams and Williamson in 1923. Here, we will only give the\nbasic principles and, in particular, discuss its implications for our understanding\nof the Earth's physical state.\nThe fundamental result I want you to remember is that the Adams-Williamson\nequation relates the gradient in density to radial variations in seismic wave speed\n(through the seismic parameter) and the mass of the Earth, which quantities\nare assumed to be known, but that this result only applies to homogeneous\nregions of the same physical phase.\nFrom the travel time curves we can determine radial variations of P and\nS-wave speed, α(r) and β(r).\nα2\nκ + 4/3μ\n(5.46)\n=\nρ\nβ2\nμ\n=\n(5.47)\nρ\nwhich can be combined to get what is known as the seismic parameter\nκ\nΦ = α2 -3 β2 = ρ\n(5.48)\nwhere α, β, ρ, μ, κ, and Φ are all functions of radius:α(r), β(r), ρ(r), μ(r),\nκ(r), and Φ(r).\nThe seismic parameter is also known as the bulk sound velocity, as the\ncounterpart of the shear velocity β.\n(Notice that the incompressibility κ in\nthese equations is, in fact, the adiabatic incompressibility or bulk modulus\nκS because the time scale of any change in κ due to changes in temperature T\n\nCHAPTER 5. GEODYNAMICS\nare much larger than the transit time of a seismic wave.) The aim is to show\nthat not only the density-normalized shear and bulk moduli can be determined,\nbut also the density itself (and thus μ and κ).\nIn general, variations in density can be due to changes in pressure (dP),\ntemperature (dT ), composition (dc) and physical phase (dφ), which can be\nwritten (in gradient form) as:\ndρ\n∂ρ\ndP\n∂ρ\ndT\n∂ρ\ndc\n∂ρ\ndφ\n=\n+\n+\n+\n(5.49)\ndr\n∂P\ndr\n∂T\ndr\n∂c\ndr\n∂φ\ndr\nFor a homogeneous medium (same composition and phase throughout) this\nequation simplifies to;\ndρ\n∂ρ\ndP\n∂ρ\ndT\n=\n+\n(5.50)\ndr\n∂P\ndr\n∂T\ndr\nFor the sake of the argument I will concentrate on the effect of adiabatic\ncompression, i.e., there is no variation of density with temperature.\ndρ\n∂ρ\ndP\n(5.51)\ndr ≈\n∂P\ndr\nThis assumption seems reasonable for most of the convecting mantle, and\nleads to the original Adams-Williamson equation. For thermal boundary layers\nsuch as the lithosphere and the lowermost mantle (D\"), and --- in case of layered\nconvection -- a TBL between the upper and the lower mantle, an additional\ngradient term has to be taken into account, and this modification has been\napplied by Birch in his famous 1952 paper (see Fowler §4.3, and Stacey §5.3.1).\nFor adiabatic self-compression the increase in pressure that results from the\ndescent from radius r + dr to radius r is due to the weight of the overlying shell\nwith thickness δr, so that the pressure gradient can be written as:\ndP\nm(r)\n= -gρ,\nwith\ng = G\n(5.52)\ndr\nr2\nThe other term in Eq. (5.51), the pressure derivative of the density, can be\nevaluated in terms of the adiabatic bulk modulus κS:\nincrease in pressure\ndP\ndP\nκS = fractional change in volume = -dV/V = ρ dρ\n(5.53)\nSubstitution of (5.52) and (5.53) in (5.51) and using (5.48) gives the Adams-\nWilliamson equation:\ndρ\nρ\nρGm(r)\nρGm(r)\n=\n=\n(5.54)\ndr\n-\nκS\nr2\n-\nΦr2\n\n5.6. THE UPPER MANTLE TRANSITION ZONE\nwhich relates the density gradient to the known seismic parameter and the\ngravitational attraction of the mass m(r). Rewrite for m(r)\nZ r\nZ REarth\nm(r) = 4π\nρ(a)a 2 da = MEarth -4π\nρ(a)a 2 da\n(5.55)\nr\nshows that m(r) is, in fact, the mass of the Earth less the mass of the shell\nbetween point r and the radius of the Earth REarth. The mass of the Earth\nis assumed to be know from astronomical data and is an important constraint\non the density gradient.\nSo the only unknown in (5.55) is the density ρ(a)\nbetween r and REarth. We can find a solution of (5.54) by working from the\nEarth's surface to larger depths: at the surface, the density of crustal rock is\nfairly well known so that the density gradient can be determined for the crust.\nThis gradient is then used to estimate the density at the base of the crust,\nwhich is then used to calculate the mass of the crustal shell. In this way we\ncan carry on the differentiation and integration to larger depths. As already\nmentioned, and explicit in (5.55), any solution of (5.54) must agree with the\ntotal mass of the Earth, as well as with the moment of inertia, which forms the\nsecond independent constraint on the solution. This process can only be applied\nin regions where dα/dr = dφ/dr = 0, and in this form one must also require\n∂ρ/∂T = 0, but -- as mentioned above -- there are approximations to (5.54)\nthat take small deviations from adiabatic compression into account.\nApplication of the (modified) Adams-Williamson equation by, amongst oth-\ners, Bullen resulted in pretty good density models for the Earth.\nThe upper mantle transition zone\nIn 1952, Birch realized that both the density gradient and the wave speed gra-\ndients in the Earth mantle between 200 and 900 km in depth are larger than\nexpected from adiabatic compression only, see the abstract of his famous paper\n(attached). This means that either dc/dr = 0 or dφ/dr = 0, or both. The man-\ntle region where the density and wave speed gradient are larger than predicted\nfrom adiabatic compression alone is loosely referred to as the (upper mantle)\ntransition zone 7 .\nThere is no consensus yet on which one applies to the Earth but it is now\nclear that dφ/dr = 0 is a sufficient condition and is probably the most important\nfactor to explain the excess density. Birch suggested that phase transformations\nin the Mg, Fe silicate system (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 (olivine, spinel) and (Mg, Fe)SiO3\n(pyroxene) could explain the increase in density required to explain the non-\nadiabatic parts of the density and wave speed gradients. We now know that\nphase transformations do indeed occur in this mineral system at depths of about\n410 and 660 km. Initially the sharpness of the interface as deduced from the\n7This is the original definition of the transition zone. Later, it became common to use the\nterm \"transition zone\" in a more restricted to indicate the mantle region between the 410 and\n660 km discontinuities. In terms of mantle processes (convection, slab behavior) the original\ndefinition is more useful.\n\nCHAPTER 5.

How-\never, experimental rock mechanics in the late eighties demonstrated that phase\nchanges can occur over sufficiently narrow depth ranges to explain the seismic\nobservations, see attached phase diagrams by Ito and Takahashi (JGR, 1989).\nThe phase changes in the (Mg, Fe) silicates play an important role in man-\ntle dynamics because the pressure induced phase changes are also temperature\ndependent! This means that phase changes can occur at different depth de-\npending on the temperature of the medium in which the transformation occurs.\nThe temperature dependence is governed by the value of the Clapeyron slope\ndP/dT of the boundaries between the stability fields of Olivine (Ol), Spinel (Sp),\nand Perovskite/Magnesiow ustite (Pv+Mw) in the P -T diagram. The phase\ndiagrams by Ito & Takahashi at 1100*C and 1600*C illustrate that the phase\nFigure by MIT OCW.\n\n5.6. THE UPPER MANTLE TRANSITION ZONE\nFigure 5.22: Phase diagrams of mineral transformations in\nthe mantle.\nchange occurs at smaller pressure if the temperature increase; i.e., the Clapey-\nron slope for the transition from Sp → Pv+Mw is negative! It's a so called\nendothermic phase change: upon phase transformation the material looses heat\nand cools down. In contrast, Ol → Sp transition that marks the phase change\nat about 410 km depth has a positive Clapeyron slope and is exothermic, i.e.\nthere is a release of latent heat upon transformation and the material will warm\nup.\nWhat does this mean for dynamics and plate driving forces? In the diagram\nI have given schematically the stability fields of Ol, Sp, and Pv+Mw, and the\nboundaries between them (i.e. the Clapeyron slopes). If one would descend into\nthe mantle along an average mantle geotherm one would cross the Clapeyron\nslope where Ol and Sp coexist at a pressure that corresponds to a depth of about\n410 km and the phase line between Sp and Pv+Mw at a pressure corresponding\nto about 660 km depth. Consider now the situation that a slab of cold, former\noceanic lithosphere subducts into the mantle and crosses the stability fields of\n\nCHAPTER 5. GEODYNAMICS\nthe silicates (assume for simplicity that the composition of the slab is the same as\nthe mantle -- which is not the case). Within the slab the phase transformation\nfrom Ol → Sp will occur at a shallower depth than in the ambient mantle.\nThis means that for depths just less than 410 km the density within the slab\nis locally higher than in the ambient mantle, and this, in fact, gives rise to an\nextra negative buoyancy force that helps the slab to subduct (it is an important\nplate driving force). At 660 km the dynamical effect of the phase change is the\nopposite. Inside and in the direct vicinity of the slab the phase boundary will\nbe depressed; consequently, the density in the slab is less than the density of\nthe ambient mantle which creates a buoyancy force that will resist the further\npenetration of the slab.\nFigure 5.23: Effects of phase transformations on downgoing\nslabs.\nFrom the diagram it is clear that the steeper the Clapeyron slope, the\nstronger the dynamic effects. On the one hand, a lot of laboratory research\nis focused on estimating the slopes of these phase boundaries in experimental\nconditions. On the other hand, and that brings us back to seismology, seis-\nmologists attempt to estimate the topography of the seismic discontinuity and\nthus constrain the clapeyron slope and asses the dynamical implications. Im-\nportant classes of seismological data that have the potential to constrain both\nthe sharpness of and the depth to the discontinuities are reflections and phase\n(mode) transformations. An example of a useful reflection is the underside re-\nflection of the PKIKPPKIKP, or PKPDF PKPDF , or just P ′P', at the 660\nkm discontinuity.\nSince the paths of the P ′P ′ phase and the P ′\nP ′ are almost similar except\nfor near the reflection point, the difference in travel time gives direct information\nabout the depth to the interface. Another example is the use of SS underside\nreflections S660S. Apart from proper phase identification (usually one applies\nstacking techniques to suppress signal to noise) the major problem with such\ntechniques is that one has to make assumptions about upper mantle structure\n\n5.6. THE UPPER MANTLE TRANSITION ZONE\nbetween the Earth's surface and the discontinuity, and these corrections are not\nalways reliable. The time difference between the reflections at the surface and\nthe discontinuity contains information about the depth to the interface, whereas\nthe frequency content of both the direct and the reflected phase gives informa-\ntion about the sharpness of the interface. Also phase conversions can be used!\nThis line of research is still very active, and there is some consensus only about\nthe very long wave length variations in depth to the seismic discontinuities."
