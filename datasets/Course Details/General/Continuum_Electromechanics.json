Typically of interest are guided and propagating waves ranging from radio to optical\nfrequencies. These may propagate through free space, in plasmas or through optical fibers. Although\nthe interaction of electromagnetic waves with media of great variety is of essential interest, and in-\ndeed the media modify these waves, it is the electromagnetic wave that is at center stage in this\nbranch. Dynamical phenomena of interest to this branch are typified by times, T, shorter than the\ntransit time of an electromagnetic wave propagating over a characteristic length of the \"system\" being\nconsidered. For a characteristic length Z and wave velocity c (in free space, the velocity of light),\nthis transit time is k/c.\nIn the chapters that follow, it is the second branch of electromagnetics that plays the major\nrole.\nIn the sense that electromagnetic wave transit times are short compared to times of interest,\nthe electric and magnetic fields are quasistatic:\nT >> R/c.\nThe important dynamical processes relate\nto conduction phenomena, to the mechanics of ponderable media, and to the two-way interaction created\nby electromagnetic forces as they elicit a mechanical response that in turn alters the fields.\nBecause the mechanics can easily upstage the electromagnetics in this second branch, it is likel\nto be perceived in terms of a few of its many parts.\nFor example, from the electromagnetic point of\nview there is much in common between issues that arise in the design of a synchronous alternator and\nof a fusion experiment. But, on the mechanical side, the rotating machine, with its problems of vibra-\ntion and fatigue, seems to have little in common with the fluid-like plasma continuum. So, the two\nareas are not generally regarded as being related.\nIn this text, the same fundamentals bear on a spectrum of applications.\nSome of these are re-\nviewed in Sec. 1.2. The unity of these widely ranging topics hinges on concepts, principles and\ntechniques that can be traced through the chapters that follow. By way of a preview, Secs. 1.3-1.7\nare outlines of these chapters, based on themes designated by the section headings.\nChapters 2 and 3 are concerned with fundamentals.\nFirst the laws and approximations are intro-\nduced that account for the effect of moving media on electromagnetic fields. Then, the-force den-\nsities and associated stress tensors needed to account for the return influence of the fields on the\nmotion are formulated.\nChapter 4 takes up the class of devices and phenomena that can be described by models in which\nthe distributions (or the relative distributions) of both the material motion and of the field sources\nare constrained. This subject of electromechanical kinematics embraces lumped parameter electro-\nmechanics. The emphasis here is on using the field point of view to determine the relationship betwee\nthe lumped parameters and the physical attributes of devices, and to determine the distribution of\nstress and force density.\nChapters 5 and 6 retain the mechanical kinematics, but delve into the self-consistent evolution\nof fields and sources. Motions of charged microscopic and macroscopic particles entrained in moving\nmedia are of interest .in their own right, but also underlie the limitations of commonly used conduc-\ntion constitutive laws. These chapters both introduce basic concepts, such as the Method of Charac-\nteristics and temporal and spatial modes, and model practical devices ranging from the electrostatic\nprecipitator to the linear induction machine.\nChapters 7-11 treat interactions of fields and media where not only the field sources are free\nto evolve in a way that is consistent with the effect of deforming media, but the mechanical systems\nrespond on a continuum basis to the electric and magnetic forces.\nChapter 7 introduces the basic laws and approximations of fluid mechanics.\nThe formulation of\nlaws, deduction of boundary conditions and use of transfer relations is a natural extension of the\nviewpoint introduced in the context of electromagnetics in Chap. 2.\nChapter 8 is concerned with electromechanical static equilibria and the dynamics resulting from\nperturbing these equilibria.\nIllustrated are a range of electromechanical models motivated by Chaps.\n5 and 6. It is here that temporal instability first comes to the fore.\nChapter 9 is largely devoted to electromechanical flows. Included is a discussion of flow\ndevelopment, understood in terms of the same physical processes represented by characteristic times\ny\nn\n\nin the previous four chapters. Flows that display super- and sub-critical behavior presage causal\neffects of wave propagation taken up in Chap. 11. The last half of this chapter is an introduction\nto \"direct\" thermal-to-electric energy conversion.\nChapter 10 is divided into parts that are each concerned with diffusion processes. Thermal diff\nsion, together with convective heat transfer, is considered first. Electrical dissipation accompanies\nalmost all electromechanical processes, so that heat transfer often poses an essential limitation on i\nvention and design. Because fields are often used for dielectric or induction heating, this is a subj\nin its own right.\nThis part begins with examples where the coupling is \"one-way\" and ends by consider\nsome of the mechanisms for two-way coupling between the thermal and electromechanical subsystems. The\nsecond part of this chapter serves as an introduction to electromechanical processes that occur on a s\ntial scale small enough that molecular diffusion processes come into play. Here introduced is the int\nplay between electric and mechanical stresses that makes it possible for particles to undergo electro-\nphoresis rather than migrate in an electric field. The concepts introduced in this second part are ap\nplicable to physicochemical systems and point to the electromechanics of biological systems.\nChapter 11 brings together models and concepts from Chaps. 5-10, emphasizing streaming interac-\ntions, in which ordered kinetic energy is available for participation in the energy conversion proces\nIncluded are fluid-like continua such as electron beams and plasmas.\n1.2 Applications\nTransducers and rotating machines that are described by the lumped parameter models of Chap. 4\nare so pervasive a part of modern day technology that their development might be regarded as complete\nBut, with new technologies outside the domain of electromechanics, there come new needs for electro-\nmechanical devices. The transducers used to drive high-speed computer print-outs are an example. Ne\ndevices in other areas also result in electromechanical innovations. For example, high power solid-\nstate electronics is revolutionizing the design and utilization of rotating machines.\nAs energy needs press the capabilities of electric power systems, rotating machines continue to\nthe mainstay of energy conversion to electrical form. Synchronous generators are subject to in-\ncreasingly stringent demands. To improve capabilities, superconducting windings are being incorpo-\nrated into a new class of generators.\nIn these synchronous alternators, magnetic materials no longer\nplay the essential role that they do in conventional machines, and new design solutions are required.\nThe Van de Graaff machine also considered in Chap. 4 should not be regarded as a serious approa\nto bulk power generation, but nevertheless represents an important approach to the generation of ex-\ntremely high potentials. It is also the grandfather of proposed energy conversion approaches. An\nexample is the electrogasdynamic \"thermal-to-electric\" energy converter of Chap. 9, Sec. 9.\nChapters 5 and 6 begin to hint at the diversity of applications outside the domain of lumped\nparameter electromechanics. The behavior of charged particles in moving fluids is important for unde\nstanding liquid insulation in transformers and cables. Again, in the area of power generation and di\ntribution, ions and charged macroscopic particles contribute to the contamination of high-voltage in-\nsulators. Also related to the overhead line transmission of electric power is the generation of audi\nnoise.\nIn this case, the charged particles considered in Chap. 5 contribute to the transduction of\nelectrical energy into acoustic form, the result being a sufficient nuisance that it figures in the d\ntermination of rights of way.\nSome examples in Chap. 5 are intended to give basic background relevant to the control of parti\nlate air pollution. The electrostatic precipitator is widely used for air pollution control. Gases\ncleaned range from the recirculating air within a single room to the exhaust of a utility. With\nindustries of all sorts committed to the use of increasingly dirtier fuels, new devices that also ex-\nploit electrical forces are under development. These include not only air pollution control equipmen\nbut devices for painting, agricultural spraying, powder deposition and the like.\nImage processing is an application of charged particle dynamics, as are other matters taken up\nlater chapters. Charged droplet printing is under development as a means of marrying the computer\nto the printed page. Xerographic and aerosol printing of considerable variety exploit electrical for\non particles.\nA visit to a printing plant, to a paper mill or to a textile factory makes the importance of\ncharges and associated electrical forces on moving materials obvious. The charge relaxation processe\nconsidered in Chap. 5 are fundamental to understanding such phenomena.\nThe induction machines considered in Chap. 6 are the most common type of rotating motor. But\nrelated interactions between moving conductors and magnetic fields also figure in a host of other\napplications. The development of high-speed ground transportation has brought into play the linear\ninduction machine as a means of propulsion, and induced magnetic forces as a means of producing mag-\nu-\nn-\nect\ning\npa-\ner-\n-\ns.\n.\nw\nbe\nch\nr-\ns-\nble\ne-\ncu-\nt,\nin\nces\ns\nSecs. 1.1 & 1.2\n\nnetic lift. Even if these developments do not reach maturity, the induction type of interaction woul\nremain important because of its application to material transport in manufacturing processes, and to\nmelting, levitation and pumping in metallurgical operations. The application of induced magnetic\nforces to the sorting of refuse is an example of how such processes can figure in seemingly unrelated\nareas.\nChapter 7 plays a role relative to fluid mechanics that Chap. 2 does with respect to electromag-\nnetics. Without a discourse on the applications of this material in its own right, consider the rele-\nvance of topics that are taken up in the subsequent chapters.\nFields can be used to position, levitate and shape fluids. In many cases, a static equilibrium\nis desired. Examples treated in Chap. 8 include the levitation of liquid metals for metallurgical\npurposes, shaping of interfaces in the processing of plastics and glass, and orientation of ferroflui\n--- C\ni4----\ni\nidi...4\ni\nsea s an\no\ncryogen c\nqu\ns\nn zero grav ty env ronments.\nThe electromechanics of systems having a static equilibrium is often dominated by instabilities\nThe insights gained in Chap. 8 are a starting point in understanding atomization processes induced by\nmeans of electric fields. Here, droplets formed by means of electric fields figure in electrostatic\npaint spraying and corona generation from conductors under foul weather conditions. Internal in-\nstabilities also taken up in Chap. 8 are basic to mixing of liquids by electrical means and for elec-\ntrical control of liquid crystal displays. Both two-phase (boiling and condensation) and convective\nheat transfer can be augmented by electromechanical coupling, usually through the mechanism of in-\nstability. Perhaps not strictly in the engineering domain is thunderstorm electrification. The\nstability of charged drops and the electrohydrodynamics of air entrained collections of charged drops\nare topics touched upon in Chap. 8 that have this meteorological application.\nThe statics and dynamics of hydromagnetic equilibria is now a subject in its own right. Largely\nbecause of its relevance to fusion machines, the discussion of hydromagnetic waves and surface insta-\nbilities serves as an introduction to an area of active research that, like other applications, has\nimportant implications for the energy posture. Internal modes taken up in Chap. 8 also have counter-\nparts in hydromagnetics.\nMagnetic pumping of liquid metals, taken up in Chap. 9, has found application in nuclear reac-\ntors and in metallurgical operations. Electrically induced pumping of semi-insulating and insulating\nliquids, also discussed in Chap. 9, has seen application, but in a range of modes. A far wider range\nof fluids have properties consistent with electric approaches to pumping and hgnce there is the promis\nof innovation in manufacturing and processing.\nMagnetohydrodynamic power generation is being actively developed as an approach to converting\nthermal energy (from burning coal) to electrical form. The discussion of this approach in Chap. 9 is\nnot only intended as an introduction to MHD energy conversion, but to the general issues confronted i\nany approach to thermal-to-electrical energy conversion, including turbine-generator systems. The el\ntrohydrodynamic converter also discussed there is an alternative to the MHD approach that sees periodi\ninterest. For that reason, its applicability is a matter that needs to be understood.\nInductive and dielectric heating, even of materials at rest and with no electromechanical con-\nsiderations, are the basis for important technologies. These topics, as well as the generation and\ntransport of heat in electromechanical systems where thermal effects often pose primary design limi-\ntations, are part of the point of the first half of Chap. 10. But, thermal effects can also be\ncentral to the electromechanical coupling itself. Examples where thermally induced property inhomo-\ngeneities result in such coupling include electrothermally induced convection of liquid insulation.\nElectromechanical coupling seated in double layers, also taken up in Chap. 10, relates to proc-\nesses (such as electrophoretic particle motions) that see applications ranging from the painting of\nautomobiles to the chemical analysis of large molecules. One of the reasons for including electro-\nkinetic and electrocapillary interactions is the suggestion it gives of mechanisms that can come into\nplay in biological systems, a subject that draws heavily on physicochemical\nconsiderations. The\npurely electromechanical models considered here serve to identify this developing area.\nThe electromechanics of streaming fluids and fluid-like systems, taken up in Chap. 11, has per-\nhaps its best known applications in the domain of electron beam engineering. Klystrons, traveling-wav\ntubes, resistive-wall amplifiers and the like are examples of interactions between streams of charged\nparticles (electrons) and various types of structures. The space-time issues of Chap. 11 have general\napplication to problems ranging from the stimulation of liquid jets used to form drops, to electro-\nmechanical processes for making synthetic fibers, to understanding liquid flow through \"wall-less\"\npipes (in which electric or magnetic fields play the role of a duct wall), to beam-plasma interaction\nthat result in instabilities that are used as a mechanism for heating plasmas.\nSec. 1.\nd\nd\n.\ne\nn\nec-\nc\ne\ns\n\n1.3 Energy Conversion Processes\nA theme of the chapters to follow is conversion of energy between electrical and mechanical forms\nThe relation between electromechanical power flow and the product of electric or magnetic stress and\nmaterial velocity is first emphasized in Chap. 4. Rotating machines deserve to be highlighted in this\nbasic sense, because for bulk power generation they are a standard for comparison. But, even where kin\nmatic systems are superseded by those involving self-consistent interactions, there is value in con-\nsidering the kinematic examples. They make clear the basic objectives governing the engineering of\nmaterials and fields even when the objectives are achieved by more devious methods. For example, the\nsynchronous interactions with constrained charged particles are not directly applicable to practical\ndevices, but highlight the basically electroquasistatic electric shear stress interaction that under-\nlies electron beam interactions in Chap. 11.\nThe classification of energy conversion processes made in Chap. 4 provides a frame of reference\nfor many of the self-consistent interactions described in later chapters. Thus, d-c rotating machines\nfrom Chap. 4 have counterparts with fluid conductors in Chap. 9, and the Van de Graaff generator is a\nprototype for the gasdynamic models developed in Chaps.\n5 and 9. Electric and magnetic induction ma-\nchines, respectively taken up in Chaps. 5 and 6, are a prototype for induction interactions with fluids\nin Chap. 9, And, the synchronous interactions of Chap. 4 motivate the self-consistent electron beam\ninteractions of Chap. 11.\n1.4 Dynamical Processes and Characteristic Times\nRate processes familiar from electrical circuits are the discharge of a capacitor (C) or an in-\nductor (L) through a resistor (R), or the oscillation of energy between a ca citor and an inductor.\nOne way to characterize the dynamics is in terms of the times RC, L/R and\nC, respectively.\nCharacteristic times describing rate processes on a continuum basis are a recurring theme. The\nelectromagnetic times summarized in Table 1.4.1 are the field analogues of those familiar from circuit\ntheory. Rather than defining the variables, reference is made to the section where the characteristic\ntimes are introduced.\nSome of the mechanical and thermal ones also have lumped parameter counter-\nparts. For example, the viscous diffusion time, which represents the mechanical damping of ponder-\nable material, is the continuum version of the damping rate for a dash-pot connected to a mass.\nThe electromechanical characteristic times represent the competition between electric or magnetic\nforces and viscous or inertial forces. In specialized areas, they may appear in a different guise.\nFor example, with the electric field intensity y that due to the bunching of electrons in a plasma,\nthe electro-inertial time is the reciprocal plasma frequency. In a highly conducting fluid stressed\nby a magnetic field intensity H, the magneto-inertial time is the transit time for an Alfvyn wave.\nEspecially in fluid mechanics, these characteristic times are often brought into play as dimensio\nless ratios of times. Table 1.4.2 gives some of these ratios, again with references to the sections\nwhere they are introduced.\n1.5 Models and Approximations\nThere are three classes of approximation, used repeatedly in the following chapters, that should\nbe recognized as a recurring theme. Formally, these are based on time-rate, space-rate and amplitude-\nparameter expansions of the relevant laws.\nThe time-rate approximation gives rise to a quasistatic model, and exploits the fact that\ntemporal rates of change of interest are slow compared to one or more times characterizing certain\ndynamical processes.\nSome possible times are given in Table 1.4.1. Both for electroquasistatics\nand magnetoquasistatics, the critical time is the electromagnetic wave transit time, Tem (Sec. 2.3).\nSpace-rate approximations lead to quasi-one-dimensional (or two-dimensional) models. These are\nalso known as long-wave models. Here, fields or deformations in a \"transverse\" direction can be approx\nmated as being slowly varying with respect to a \"longitidunal\" direction. The magnetic field in a\nnarrow but spatially varying air gap and the flow of a gas through a duct of slowly varying cross\nsection are examples.\nAmplitude parameter expansions carried to first order result in linearized models.\nOften they\nare used to describe dynamics departing from a static or steady equilibrium. Long-wave and linearized\nmodels are discussed and exemplified in Sec. 4.12, and are otherwise used repeatedly without formality.\n.\ne-\nn-\ni-\nSecs. 1.3, 1.4 & 1.5\n\nTable 1.4.1.

The dependence of\nvariables on this direction is represented by \"transfer relations.\"\nThey are first introduced in\nChap. 2 as flux-potential relations that encapsulate Laplacian fields in coordinate systems for which\nLaplace's equation is variable separable.\nAt the risk of having a forbidding appearance, most chapters include summaries of transfer rela\ntions in the three common coordinate systems. This is done so that they can be a resource, helping t\nobviate tedious manipulations that tend to obscure what is essential in the derivation of a model. T\ntransfer relations help in organizing a development. Once the way in which they represent the space-\ntime dynamics of a given medium is appreciated, they are also a way of quickly communicating the\nphysical nature of a continuum.\nApplications in Chap. 4 begin to exemplify how the transfer relations can help to organize the\nrepresentation of configurations involving piece-wise uniform media. The systems considered there a\nspatially periodic in the \"longitudinal\" direction.\nWith each of the subsequent chapters, the application of the transfer relations is broadened.\nChap. 5, the temporal transient response is described in terms of the temporal modes. Then, spatial\ntransients for systems in the temporal sinusoidal steady state are considered. In Chap. 6, magnetic\ndiffusion processes are represented in terms of transfer relations, which take a form equally applica\nto thermal and particle diffusion.\nMuch of the summary of fluid mechanics given in Chap. 7 is couched in terms of transfer relatio\nThere, the variables are velocities and stresses. In a wealth of electromechanical examples, couplin\nbetween fields and media can be represented as occurring at boundaries and interfaces, where there ar\ndiscontinuities in properties. Thus, in Chap. 8, the purely mechanical relations of Chap. 7 are com-\nbined with the electrical relations from Chap. 2 to represent electromechanical systems. More spe-\ncialized are electromechanical transfer relations representing charged fluids, electron beams, hydro-\nmagnetic systems and the like, derived in Chaps. 8-11.\nA feature of many of the examples in Chap. 8 is instability, so that again the temporal modes\ncome to the fore. But with effects of streaming brought into play in Chap. 11, there is a question\nof whether the instability is absolute in the sense that the response becomes unbounded with time at\na given point in space, or convective (amplifying) in that a sinusoidal steady state can be\nestablished but with a response that becomes unbounded in space. These issues are taken up in Chap.\n-\no\nhe\nre\nIn\nble\nns.\ng\ne\n11.\nSec. 1.6"

Here introduced is the inter-\nplay between electric and mechanical stresses that makes it possible for particles to undergo electro-\nphoresis rather than migrate in an electric field. The concepts introduced in this second part are ap-\nplicable to physicochemical systems and point to the electromechanics of biological systems.\nChapter 11 brings together models and concepts from Chaps. 5-10, emphasizing streaming interac-\ntions, in which ordered kinetic energy is available for participation in the energy conversion process.\nIncluded are fluid-like continua such as electron beams and plasmas.\n1.2 Applications\nTransducers and rotating machines that are described by the lumped parameter models of Chap. 4\nare so pervasive a part of modern day technology that their development might be regarded as complete.\nBut, with new technologies outside the domain of electromechanics, there come new needs for electro-\nmechanical devices. The transducers used to drive high-speed computer print-outs are an example. New\ndevices in other areas also result in electromechanical innovations. For example, high power solid-\nstate electronics is revolutionizing the design and utilization of rotating machines.\nAs energy needs press the capabilities of electric power systems, rotating machines continue to be\nthe mainstay of energy conversion to electrical form. Synchronous generators are subject to in-\ncreasingly stringent demands. To improve capabilities, superconducting windings are being incorpo-\nrated into a new class of generators.\nIn these synchronous alternators, magnetic materials no longer\nplay the essential role that they do in conventional machines, and new design solutions are required.\nThe Van de Graaff machine also considered in Chap. 4 should not be regarded as a serious approach\nto bulk power generation, but nevertheless represents an important approach to the generation of ex-\ntremely high potentials. It is also the grandfather of proposed energy conversion approaches. An\nexample is the electrogasdynamic \"thermal-to-electric\" energy converter of Chap. 9, Sec. 9.\nChapters 5 and 6 begin to hint at the diversity of applications outside the domain of lumped\nparameter electromechanics. The behavior of charged particles in moving fluids is important for under-\nstanding liquid insulation in transformers and cables. Again, in the area of power generation and dis-\ntribution, ions and charged macroscopic particles contribute to the contamination of high-voltage in-\nsulators. Also related to the overhead line transmission of electric power is the generation of audible\nnoise.\nIn this case, the charged particles considered in Chap. 5 contribute to the transduction of\nelectrical energy into acoustic form, the result being a sufficient nuisance that it figures in the de-\ntermination of rights of way.\nSome examples in Chap. 5 are intended to give basic background relevant to the control of particu-\nlate air pollution. The electrostatic precipitator is widely used for air pollution control. Gases\ncleaned range from the recirculating air within a single room to the exhaust of a utility. With\nindustries of all sorts committed to the use of increasingly dirtier fuels, new devices that also ex-\nploit electrical forces are under development. These include not only air pollution control equipment,\nbut devices for painting, agricultural spraying, powder deposition and the like.\nImage processing is an application of charged particle dynamics, as are other matters taken up in\nlater chapters. Charged droplet printing is under development as a means of marrying the computer\nto the printed page. Xerographic and aerosol printing of considerable variety exploit electrical forces\non particles.\nA visit to a printing plant, to a paper mill or to a textile factory makes the importance of\ncharges and associated electrical forces on moving materials obvious. The charge relaxation processes\nconsidered in Chap. 5 are fundamental to understanding such phenomena.\nThe induction machines considered in Chap. 6 are the most common type of rotating motor. But\nrelated interactions between moving conductors and magnetic fields also figure in a host of other\napplications. The development of high-speed ground transportation has brought into play the linear\ninduction machine as a means of propulsion, and induced magnetic forces as a means of producing mag-\nSecs. 1.1 & 1.2\n\nnetic lift. Even if these developments do not reach maturity, the induction type of interaction would\nremain important because of its application to material transport in manufacturing processes, and to\nmelting, levitation and pumping in metallurgical operations. The application of induced magnetic\nforces to the sorting of refuse is an example of how such processes can figure in seemingly unrelated\nareas.\nChapter 7 plays a role relative to fluid mechanics that Chap. 2 does with respect to electromag-\nnetics. Without a discourse on the applications of this material in its own right, consider the rele-\nvance of topics that are taken up in the subsequent chapters.\nFields can be used to position, levitate and shape fluids. In many cases, a static equilibrium\nis desired. Examples treated in Chap. 8 include the levitation of liquid metals for metallurgical\npurposes, shaping of interfaces in the processing of plastics and glass, and orientation of ferrofluid\n---\nC\ni4----\ni\nidi...4\ni\nsea s an\no\ncryogen c\nqu\ns\nn zero grav ty env ronments.\nThe electromechanics of systems having a static equilibrium is often dominated by instabilities.\nThe insights gained in Chap. 8 are a starting point in understanding atomization processes induced by\nmeans of electric fields. Here, droplets formed by means of electric fields figure in electrostatic\npaint spraying and corona generation from conductors under foul weather conditions. Internal in-\nstabilities also taken up in Chap. 8 are basic to mixing of liquids by electrical means and for elec-\ntrical control of liquid crystal displays. Both two-phase (boiling and condensation) and convective\nheat transfer can be augmented by electromechanical coupling, usually through the mechanism of in-\nstability. Perhaps not strictly in the engineering domain is thunderstorm electrification. The\nstability of charged drops and the electrohydrodynamics of air entrained collections of charged drops\nare topics touched upon in Chap. 8 that have this meteorological application.\nThe statics and dynamics of hydromagnetic equilibria is now a subject in its own right. Largely\nbecause of its relevance to fusion machines, the discussion of hydromagnetic waves and surface insta-\nbilities serves as an introduction to an area of active research that, like other applications, has\nimportant implications for the energy posture. Internal modes taken up in Chap. 8 also have counter-\nparts in hydromagnetics.\nMagnetic pumping of liquid metals, taken up in Chap. 9, has found application in nuclear reac-\ntors and in metallurgical operations. Electrically induced pumping of semi-insulating and insulating\nliquids, also discussed in Chap. 9, has seen application, but in a range of modes. A far wider range\nof fluids have properties consistent with electric approaches to pumping and hgnce there is the promise\nof innovation in manufacturing and processing.\nMagnetohydrodynamic power generation is being actively developed as an approach to converting\nthermal energy (from burning coal) to electrical form. The discussion of this approach in Chap. 9 is\nnot only intended as an introduction to MHD energy conversion, but to the general issues confronted in\nany approach to thermal-to-electrical energy conversion, including turbine-generator systems. The elec-\ntrohydrodynamic converter also discussed there is an alternative to the MHD approach that sees periodic\ninterest. For that reason, its applicability is a matter that needs to be understood.\nInductive and dielectric heating, even of materials at rest and with no electromechanical con-\nsiderations, are the basis for important technologies. These topics, as well as the generation and\ntransport of heat in electromechanical systems where thermal effects often pose primary design limi-\ntations, are part of the point of the first half of Chap. 10. But, thermal effects can also be\ncentral to the electromechanical coupling itself. Examples where thermally induced property inhomo-\ngeneities result in such coupling include electrothermally induced convection of liquid insulation.\nElectromechanical coupling seated in double layers, also taken up in Chap. 10, relates to proc-\nesses (such as electrophoretic particle motions) that see applications ranging from the painting of\nautomobiles to the chemical analysis of large molecules. One of the reasons for including electro-\nkinetic and electrocapillary interactions is the suggestion it gives of mechanisms that can come into\nplay in biological systems, a subject that draws heavily on physicochemical\nconsiderations. The\npurely electromechanical models considered here serve to identify this developing area.\nThe electromechanics of streaming fluids and fluid-like systems, taken up in Chap. 11, has per-\nhaps its best known applications in the domain of electron beam engineering. Klystrons, traveling-wave\ntubes, resistive-wall amplifiers and the like are examples of interactions between streams of charged\nparticles (electrons) and various types of structures. The space-time issues of Chap. 11 have general\napplication to problems ranging from the stimulation of liquid jets used to form drops, to electro-\nmechanical processes for making synthetic fibers, to understanding liquid flow through \"wall-less\"\npipes (in which electric or magnetic fields play the role of a duct wall), to beam-plasma interactions\nthat result in instabilities that are used as a mechanism for heating plasmas.\nSec. 1.2\n\n1.3 Energy Conversion Processes\nA theme of the chapters to follow is conversion of energy between electrical and mechanical forms.\nThe relation between electromechanical power flow and the product of electric or magnetic stress and\nmaterial velocity is first emphasized in Chap. 4. Rotating machines deserve to be highlighted in this\nbasic sense, because for bulk power generation they are a standard for comparison. But, even where kine-\nmatic systems are superseded by those involving self-consistent interactions, there is value in con-\nsidering the kinematic examples. They make clear the basic objectives governing the engineering of\nmaterials and fields even when the objectives are achieved by more devious methods. For example, the\nsynchronous interactions with constrained charged particles are not directly applicable to practical\ndevices, but highlight the basically electroquasistatic electric shear stress interaction that under-\nlies electron beam interactions in Chap. 11.\nThe classification of energy conversion processes made in Chap. 4 provides a frame of reference\nfor many of the self-consistent interactions described in later chapters. Thus, d-c rotating machines\nfrom Chap. 4 have counterparts with fluid conductors in Chap. 9, and the Van de Graaff generator is a\nprototype for the gasdynamic models developed in Chaps.\n5 and 9. Electric and magnetic induction ma-\nchines, respectively taken up in Chaps. 5 and 6, are a prototype for induction interactions with fluids\nin Chap. 9, And, the synchronous interactions of Chap. 4 motivate the self-consistent electron beam\ninteractions of Chap. 11.\n1.4 Dynamical Processes and Characteristic Times\nRate processes familiar from electrical circuits are the discharge of a capacitor (C) or an in-\nductor (L) through a resistor (R), or the oscillation of energy between a ca citor and an inductor.\nOne way to characterize the dynamics is in terms of the times RC, L/R and\nC, respectively.\nCharacteristic times describing rate processes on a continuum basis are a recurring theme. The\nelectromagnetic times summarized in Table 1.4.1 are the field analogues of those familiar from circuit\ntheory. Rather than defining the variables, reference is made to the section where the characteristic\ntimes are introduced.\nSome of the mechanical and thermal ones also have lumped parameter counter-\nparts. For example, the viscous diffusion time, which represents the mechanical damping of ponder-\nable material, is the continuum version of the damping rate for a dash-pot connected to a mass.\nThe electromechanical characteristic times represent the competition between electric or magnetic\nforces and viscous or inertial forces. In specialized areas, they may appear in a different guise.\nFor example, with the electric field intensity y that due to the bunching of electrons in a plasma,\nthe electro-inertial time is the reciprocal plasma frequency. In a highly conducting fluid stressed\nby a magnetic field intensity H, the magneto-inertial time is the transit time for an Alfvyn wave.\nEspecially in fluid mechanics, these characteristic times are often brought into play as dimension-\nless ratios of times. Table 1.4.2 gives some of these ratios, again with references to the sections\nwhere they are introduced.\n1.5 Models and Approximations\nThere are three classes of approximation, used repeatedly in the following chapters, that should\nbe recognized as a recurring theme. Formally, these are based on time-rate, space-rate and amplitude-\nparameter expansions of the relevant laws.\nThe time-rate approximation gives rise to a quasistatic model, and exploits the fact that\ntemporal rates of change of interest are slow compared to one or more times characterizing certain\ndynamical processes.\nSome possible times are given in Table 1.4.1. Both for electroquasistatics\nand magnetoquasistatics, the critical time is the electromagnetic wave transit time, Tem (Sec. 2.3).\nSpace-rate approximations lead to quasi-one-dimensional (or two-dimensional) models. These are\nalso known as long-wave models. Here, fields or deformations in a \"transverse\" direction can be approxi-\nmated as being slowly varying with respect to a \"longitidunal\" direction. The magnetic field in a\nnarrow but spatially varying air gap and the flow of a gas through a duct of slowly varying cross\nsection are examples.\nAmplitude parameter expansions carried to first order result in linearized models.\nOften they\nare used to describe dynamics departing from a static or steady equilibrium. Long-wave and linearized\nmodels are discussed and exemplified in Sec. 4.12, and are otherwise used repeatedly without formality.\nSecs. 1.3, 1.4 & 1.5\n\nTable 1.4.1.

The dependence of\nvariables on this direction is represented by \"transfer relations.\"\nThey are first introduced in\nChap. 2 as flux-potential relations that encapsulate Laplacian fields in coordinate systems for which\nLaplace's equation is variable separable.\nAt the risk of having a forbidding appearance, most chapters include summaries of transfer rela-\ntions in the three common coordinate systems. This is done so that they can be a resource, helping to\nobviate tedious manipulations that tend to obscure what is essential in the derivation of a model. The\ntransfer relations help in organizing a development. Once the way in which they represent the space-\ntime dynamics of a given medium is appreciated, they are also a way of quickly communicating the\nphysical nature of a continuum.\nApplications in Chap. 4 begin to exemplify how the transfer relations can help to organize the\nrepresentation of configurations involving piece-wise uniform media. The systems considered there are\nspatially periodic in the \"longitudinal\" direction.\nWith each of the subsequent chapters, the application of the transfer relations is broadened. In\nChap. 5, the temporal transient response is described in terms of the temporal modes. Then, spatial\ntransients for systems in the temporal sinusoidal steady state are considered. In Chap. 6, magnetic\ndiffusion processes are represented in terms of transfer relations, which take a form equally applicable\nto thermal and particle diffusion.\nMuch of the summary of fluid mechanics given in Chap. 7 is couched in terms of transfer relations.\nThere, the variables are velocities and stresses. In a wealth of electromechanical examples, coupling\nbetween fields and media can be represented as occurring at boundaries and interfaces, where there are\ndiscontinuities in properties. Thus, in Chap. 8, the purely mechanical relations of Chap. 7 are com-\nbined with the electrical relations from Chap. 2 to represent electromechanical systems. More spe-\ncialized are electromechanical transfer relations representing charged fluids, electron beams, hydro-\nmagnetic systems and the like, derived in Chaps. 8-11.\nA feature of many of the examples in Chap. 8 is instability, so that again the temporal modes\ncome to the fore. But with effects of streaming brought into play in Chap. 11, there is a question\nof whether the instability is absolute in the sense that the response becomes unbounded with time at\na given point in space, or convective (amplifying) in that a sinusoidal steady state can be\nestablished but with a response that becomes unbounded in space. These issues are taken up in Chap. 11.\nSec. 1.6"

Rationalized MKS units are used not only\nin connection with electrodynamics, but also in dealing with subjects such as fluid mechanics and heat\ntransfer, which are often treated in English units. Unless otherwise given, basic units of meters (m),\nkilograms (kg), seconds (sec), and Coulombs (C) can be assumed.\nTable 2.1.1.\nSummary of electrodynamic nomenclature.\nName\nSymbol\nUnits\nDiscrete Variables\nVoltage or potential difference\nv\n[V] = volts = m2 kg/C sec2\nCharge\nq\n[C] = Coulombs = C\nCurrent\ni\n[A] = Amperes = C/sec\nMagnetic flux\nX\n[Wb] = Weber = m2 kg/C sec\nCapacitance\nC\n[F] = Farad C2 sec 2 /m2 kg\nInductance\nL\n[H] = Henry = m2 kg/C2\nForce\nf\n[N] = Newtons = kg m/sec2\nField Sources\nFree charge density\nPf\nC/m3\nFree surface charge density\n-f\nC/m\nFree current density\n4f\nA/m2\nFree surface current density\nKf\nA/m\nFields (name in quotes is often used for convenience)\n\"Electric field\" intensity\nV/m\n\"Magnetic field\" intensity\nA/m\nElectric displacement\nC/m2\nMagnetic flux density\nWb/m 2 (tesla)\nPolarization density\nC/m2\nMagnetization density\nM\nA/m\nForce density\nF\nN/m3\nPhysical Constants\nPermittivity of free space\n6o = 8.854 x 1012\nF/m\nPermeability of free space\n1o = 4r x 10- 7\nH/m\nAlthough terms involving moving magnetized and polarized media may not be familiar, Maxwell's\nequations are summarized without prelude in the next section. The physical significance of the un-\nfamiliar terms can best be discussed in Secs. 2.8 and 2.9 after the general laws are reduced to their\nquasistatic forms, and this is the objective of Sec. 2.3.\nExcept for introducing concepts concerned\nwith the description of continua, including integral theorems, in Secs. 2.4 and 2.6, and the dis-\ncussion of Fourier amplitudes in Sec. 2.15, the remainder of the chapter is a parallel development of\nthe consequences of these quasistatic laws. That the field transformations (Sec. 2.5), integral laws\n(Sec. 2.7), splicing conditions (Sec. 2.10), and energy storages are derived from the fundamental quasi-\nstatic laws, illustrates the important dictum that internal consistency be maintained within the frame-\nwork of the quasistatic approximation.\nThe results of the sections on energy storage are used in Chap. 3 for deducing the electric and\nmagnetic force densities on macroscopic media. The transfer relations of the last sections are an\nimportant resource throughout all of the following chapters, and give the opportunity to explore the\nphysical significance of the quasistatic limits.\n2.2 Differential Laws of Electrodynamics\nIn the Chu formulation,l with material effects on the fields accounted for by the magnetization\ndensity M and the polarization density P and with the material velocity denoted by v, the laws of\nelectrodynamics are:\nFaraday's law\n4+\n3H\nat\nP--\no\nM\n(+\no\no\nSt\nBt\n1. P. Penfield, Jr., and H. A. Haus, Electrodynamics of Moving Media, The M.I.T.

In this formulation the electric displacement\nand magnetic flux\ndensity B are defined fields:\nD =\nE + P\n(6)\no\n4-\n-\nB =\no(H + M)\n(7)\n2.3\nQuasistatic Laws and the Time-Rate Expansion\nWith a quasistatic model, it is recognized that relevant time rates of change are sufficiently\nlow that contributions due to a particular dynamical process are ignorable. The objective in this\nsection is to give some formal structure to the reasoning used to deduce the quasistatic field equa-\ntions from the more general Maxwell's equations. Here, quasistatics specifically means that times\nof interest are long compared to the time, Tem, for an electromagnetic wave to propagate through the\nsystem.\nGenerally, given a dynamical process characterized by some time determined by the parameters of\nthe system, a quasistatic model can be used to exploit the comparatively long time scale for proc-\nesses of interest. In this broad sense, quasistatic models abound and will be encountered in many\nother contexts in the chapters that follow. Specific examples are:\n(a) processes slow compared to wave transit times in general; acoustic waves and the model is\none of incompressible flow, Alfvyn and other electromechanical waves and the model is less standard;\n(b) processes slow compared to diffusion (instantaneous diffusion models). What diffuses can\nbe magnetic field, viscous stresses, heat, molecules or hybrid electromechanical effects;\n(c) processes slow compared to relaxation of continua (instantaneous relaxation or constant-\npotential models). Charge relaxation is an important example.\nThe point of making a quasistatic approximation is often to focus attention on significant\ndynamical processes. A quasistatic model is by no means static.\nBecause more than one rate process\nis often imbedded in a given physical system, it is important to agree upon the one with respect to\nwhich the dynamics are quasistatic.\nRate processes other than those due to the transit time of electromagnetic waves enter through\nthe dependence of the field sources on the fields and material motion. To have in view the additional\ncharacteristic times typically brought in by the field sources, in this section the free current\ndensity is postulated to have the dependence\nJf = G(r)E + J v(v,pf,H)\n(i)\nIn the absence of motion, Jv is zero. Thus, for media at rest the conduction model is ohmic, with the\nel-ctrical conductivity a in general a funqtion Qf position. Examples of Jv are a convection current\npfv, or an ohmic motion-induced current a(v x\n0oH).\nWith an underbar used to denote a normalized\nquantity, the conductivity is normalized to a typical (constant) conductivity a :\na =\n(r,t)\n(2)\no-\nTo identify the hierarchy of critical time-rate parameters, the general laws are normalized.\nCoordinates are normalized to one typical length X, while T represents a characteristic dynamical time:\n(x,y,z) = (Zx,kY,kz);\nt = Tt\n(3)\nSecs. 2.2 & 2.3\n\nIn a system sinusoidally excited at the angular frequency\n, T= W-1l\nIn a system sinusoidally excited at the angular frequency w, T=w\nThe most convenient normalization of the fields depends on the specific system. Where electro-\nmechanical coupling is significant, these can usually be categorized as \"electric-field dominated\" and\n\"magnetic-field dominated.\"\nAnticipating this fact, two normalizations are now developed \"in parallel,\"\nthe first taking e as a characteristic electric field and the second taking _ as.a characteristic mag-\nnetic field:\nH = H,\nM v = (/),\n=\nJ\no\nv\nT -v\n=\nLf\n-v\npf =-\np E 9\nf , H=-\nH\n0 8 -H,M M\n0 T-\n+\nE=\nP Pf\n.p-, P=f\n,\n-\nP\nIt might be appropriate with this step to recognize that the material motion introduces a characteristic\n(transport) time other than T. For simplicity, Eq. 4 takes the material velocity as being of the order\nof R/T.\nThe normalization used is arbitrary. The same quasistatic laws will be deduced regardless of the\nstarting point, but the normalization will determine whether these laws are \"zero-order\" or higher order\nin a sense to now be defined.\nThe normalizations of Eq. 4 introduced into Eqs. 2.2.1-5 result in\nV.1 = -V.y + pf\nV.E = -V.p +\nV.H = -V-M\nV.H = -V.M\nTm\n+ T\n+.\n+\nE\n9P\n(\nx)\nVxH = -\naE\n+ J +\n+ -- +Vx (P xv)\nVxH = --\nE + J\n+ Vx(P x v\n(7)\nT\nv\n+\n+t ~t\nT\nO\n+\nBtA\ne\nH + 3\nV\nx\nS\nH\nVxE\n=\nat\nV x (Mx v)\n(8)\nVxE = -s\nt\nt + Vx ~-V]\n(x\ne\nS F\n~f\nV.\nE + -\nV*J\nt+\nV.

The time required for an electromagnetic plane wave to propa-\ngate the distance k at the velocity c is Tem. Given that there is just one characteristic length,\nthere are actually only two characteristic times, because as can be seen from Eq. 10\n(11)\nT\nme\nem\nUnless Te and Tm, and hence Tem, are all of the same order, there are only two possibilities for the\nrelative magnitudes of these times, as summarized in Fig. 2.3.1.\n18W(I\nI\n( 4((1\n_\n~\nI\nIr\nTCe\nem\nm\nTm\n-\nelectroquasistati cs\nmagnetoquasistatics\nFig. 2.3.1.

Note that T is still arbitrary relative to Te\nIn the magnetoquasistatic (MQS) approximation, 0 is still small, but the ordering of characteristic ti\nis as to the right. In this case, T is arbitrary relative to Tm.\nTo make a formal statement of the procedure used to find the quasistatic approximation, the norm\nized fields and charge density are expanded in powers of the time-rate parameter 0.\nE = E + E1 +\nE\n+\n0 +\n+\n0o\n8 H01\n+2\n(12)\niv -\n( v)o + 0v)\n+0 ( )2 +\nPf = (Pf)o +\n(Pf) 1 +\n()2 +\nIn the following, it is assumed that constitutive laws relate P and M to E and H, so that these\ndensities are similarly expanded. The velocity 4 is taken as given. Then, the series are sub-\nstituted into Eqs. 5-9 and the resulting expressions arranged by factors multiplying ascending\npowers of 0. The \"zero order\" equations are obtained by requiring that the coefficients of 8\nvanish. These are simply Eqs. 5-9 with B = 0:\nV.- o = -V.-P\n+ (pf)\nV.E = -V.o\no\n+ (P)o\n(13)\nv-H -V-M\n(14)\nVxHo =\n-\no0\nT\n÷\n(15)\nat\nVxH\n--\na E\n+ (J )\n(Jv)o + --\ne\napo\n+ ---\n+ Vx (o x V)\naH\naM\n4.\nVxE\nVxE\no\nVx(M\nx V)\no\no\nat\nat\n(16)\nV.oE\n+ +T-\ne\n- (v\no\n= 0\n+\nat\nV.o E +_V.)\n=0\nEo\nT\nV)o\n(17)\nm\nThe zero-order solutions are found by solving these equations, augmented by appropriate\nboundary conditions. If the boundary conditions are themselves time dependent, normalization\nwill turn up additional characteristic times that must be fitted into the hierarchy of Fig. 2.3.1.\nHigher order contributions to the series of Eq. 12 follow from a sequential solution of the\nequations found by making coefficients of like powers of y vanish.

Thus higher order fields satisfy homo-\ngeneous boundary conditions.\nOnce the first order solutions are known, the process can be repeated with these forming the\n\"drives\" for the n=2 equations.\nIn the absence of loss effects, there are no characteristic times to distinguish MQS and EQS\nsystems. In that limit, which set of normalizations is used is a matter of convenience. If a situa-\ntion represented by the left-hand set actually has an EQS limit, the zero order laws become the quasi-\nstatic laws.\nBut, if these expressions are applied to a situation that is actually MQS, then first-\norder terms must be calculated to find the quasistatic fields. If more than the one characteristic\ntime Tern is involved, as is the case with finite Te and Tm, then the ordering of rate parameters can\ncontribute to the convergence of the expansion.\nIn practice, a formal derivation of the quasistatic laws is seldom used. Rather, intuition and\nexperience along with comparison of critical time constants to relevant dynamical times is used to\nidentify one of the two sets of zero order expressions as appropriate. But, the use of normalizations\nto identify critical parameters, and the notion that characteristic times can be used to unscramble\ndynamical processes, will be used extensively in the chapters to follow.\nWithin the framework of quasistatic electrodynamics, the unnormalized forms of Eqs. 13-17\nconmrise the \"exact\" field laws\nThese enuations are reordered to reflect their relative imnortance:\nElectroquasistatic (EQS)\nMagnetoquasistatic (MQS)\nV.-E E=\nVx\n-V'P\n= f\n(23)\n+ Pf\nVx = 0\nV.1oH = -V.o M\n(24)\nS\napf\na4,.

With different conduction models will come different\ncharacteristic times,exemplified in the discussions of this section by Te and Tm . Matters are more\ncomplicated if fields and media interact electromechanically. Then, v is determined to some extent\nat least by the fields themselves and must be treated on a par with the field variables. The result\ncan be still more characteristic times.\nThe ordering of the quasistatic equations emphasizes the instantaneous relation between the\nrespective dominant sources and fields. Given the charge and polarization densities in the EQS system,\nor given the current and magnetization densities in the MQS system, the dominant fields are known and\nare functions only of the sources at the given instant in time.\nThe dynamics enter in the EQS system with conservation of charge, and in the MQS system with\nFaraday'l law of induction. Equations 26a and 27a are only needed 4f an after-the-fact determina-\ntion of H is to be made. An example where such a rare interest in H exists is in the small mag-\nnetic field induced by electric fields and currents within the human body. The distribution of in-\nternal fields and hence currents is determined by the first three EQS equations. Given 1, -, and\nJf, the remaining two expressions determine H. In the MQS system, Eq. 27b can be regarded as an\nexpression for the after-the-fact evaluation of pf, which is not usually of interest in such systems.\nWhat makes the subject of quasistatics difficult to treat in a general way,even for a system\nof fixed ohmic conductivity, is the dependence of the appropriate model on considerations not con-\nveniently represented in the differential laws. For example, a pair of perfectly conducting plates,\nshorted on one pair of edges and driven by a sinusoidal source at the opposite pair, will be MQS\nat low frequencies. The same pair of plates, open-circuited rather than shorted, will be electroquasi-\nstatic at low frequencies. The difference is in the boundary conditions.\nGeometry and the inhomogeneity of the medium (insulators, perfect conductors and semiconductors)\none\nare also essential to determining the appropriate approximation. Most systems require more than\nn=l are solved with the zero order\nSec. 2.3\n\ncharacteristic dimension and perhaps conductivity for their description, with the result that more than\ntwo time constants are often involved. Thus, the two possibilities identified in Fig. 2.3.1 can in\nprinciple become many possibilities. Even so, for a wide range of practical problems, the appropriate\nfield laws are either clearly electroquasistatic or magnetoquasistatic.\nProblems accompanying this section help to make the significance of the quasistatic limits more\nsubstantive by considering cases that can also be solved exactly.\n2.4 Continuum Coordinates and the Convective Derivative\nThere are two commonly used representations of continuum variables.\nOne of these is familiar\nfrom classical mechanics, while the other is universally used in electrodynamics. Because electro-\nmechanics involves both of these subjects, attention is now drawn to the salient features of the two\nrepresentations.\nConsider first the \"Lagrangian representation.\"\nThe position of a material particle is a natural\nexample and is depicted by Fig. 2.4.1a. When the time t is zero, a particle is found at the position\nro .\nThe position of the particle at some subsequent time is t. To let t represent the displacement of\na continuum of particles, the position variable ro is used to distinguish particles.\nIn this sense, the\ndisplacement y then also becomes a continuum variable capable of representing the relative displace-\nments of an infinitude of particles.\n)\n~\nu)\nk U)\nFig. 2.4.1.\nParticle motions represented in terms of (a) Lagrangian coordinates,\nwhere the initial particle coordinate ro designates the particle of\ninterest, and (b) Eulerian coordinates, where (x,y,z) designates the\nspatial position of interest.\nIn a Lagrangian representation, the velocity of the particle is simply\nat\nIf concern is with only one particle, there is no point in writing the derivative as a partial deriv-\native. However, it is understood that, when the derivgtive is taken, it is a particular particle\nwhich is being considered. So, it is understood that ro is fixed. Using the same line of reasoning,\nthe acceleration of a particle is given by\na at\nThe idea of representing continuum variables in terms of the coordinates (x,y,z) connected with\nthe space itself is familiar from electromagnetic theory. But what does it mean if the variable is\nmechanical rather than electrical? We could represent the velocit- of the continuum of particles\nfilling the space of interest by a vector function v(x,y,z,t) = v(r,t).\nThe velocity of particles\nhaving the position (x,y,z,) at a given time t is determined by evaluating the function v(r,t).\nThe\nvelocity appearing in Sec. 2.2 is an example. As suggested by Fig. 2.4.1b, if the function is the\nvelocity evaluated at a given position in space, it describes whichever particle is at that point at\nthe time of interest. Generally, there is a continuous stream of particles through the point (x,y,z).\nSecs. 2.3 & 2.4\n\nComputation of the particle acceleration makes evident the contrast between Eulerian and Lagrangian\nrepresentations. By definition, the acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity computed for a\ngiven particle of matter. A particle having the position (x,y,z) at time t will be found an instant\nAt later at the position (x + vxAt,y + vyAt,z + vzAt).\nHence the acceleration is\nv(x + v At,y + v At,z + v At,t + At) - v(x,y,z,t)\na=lim\nx\ny\nz\n(3)\nAt÷OAt\nExpansion of tje first term in Eq. 3 about the initial coordinates of the particle gives the convective\nderivative of v:\n+\nv\nav\nav\nav _\nv\n+\n+\na\n+ v\n+ v\n+ v z\n+ v*Vv\n(4)\nt\nx ax\ny\ny\n(4)at\nThe difference between Eq. 2 and Eq. 4 is resolved by recognizing the difference in the signi-\nficance of the partial derivatives. In Eq. 2, it is understood that the coordinates being held fixed\nare the initial coordinates of the particle of interest. In Eq. 4, the partial derivative is taken,\nholding fixed the particular point of interest in space.\nThe same steps .show that the rate of change of any vector variable A, as viewed from a particle\nhaving the velocity v, is\nDAaA 31\n+\n(\nS-\n+ (V);\nA = A(x,y,z,t)\n(5)\nThe time rate of change of any scalar variable for an observer moving with the velocity v is obtained\nfrom Eq. 5 by considering the particular case in which t has only one component, say 1 = f(x,y,z,t)Ax.\nThen Eq. 5 becomes\nDf\nf- E - -+\nf\n+f\nv.Vf\n(6)\nReference 3 of Appendix C is a film useful in understanding this section.\n2.5 Transformations between Inertial Frames\nIn extending empirically determined conduction, polarization and magnetization laws to include\nmaterial motion, it is often necessary to relate field variables evaluated in different reference\nframes. A given point in space can be designated either in terms of the coordinate 1 or of the co-\nordinate V' of Fig. 2.5.1. By \"inertial reference frames,\" it is meant that the relative velocity\nbetween these two frames is constant, designated by '. The positions in the two coordinate systems\nare related by the Galilean transformation:\nr'\n= r -\nut;\nt'\n= t\n(1)\nFig. 2.5.1\nReference frames have constant\nrelative velocity t. The co-\nordinates t = (x,y,z) and 1' =\n(x',y',z') designate the same\nposition.\nIt is a familiar fact that variables describing a given physical situation in one reference frame\nwill not be the same as those in the other. An example is material velocity, which, if measured in one\nframe, will differ from that in the other frame by the relative velocity ~.\nThere are two objectives in this section: one is to show that the quasistatic laws are invariant\nwhen subject to a Galilean transformation between inertial reference frames. But, of more use is the\nrelationship between electromagnetic variables in the two frames of reference that follows from this\nSecs. 2.4 & 2.5\n\ntake\nquasistatic\nequations\nmade\nthe\nis\nthat\nthe\nThe\napproach\nis\nas\nfollows.\nFirst,\npostulate\nproof.\nsame\nform\nin\nthe\nprimed\nand\nunprimed\ninertial\nreference\nframes.\nBut,\nin\nwriting\nthe\nlaws\nin\nthe\nprimed\nframe,\nthe\nspatial\nand\ntemporal\nderivatives\nmust\nbe\ntaken\nwith\nrespect\nto\nthe\ncoordinates\nof\nthat\nref-\nerence\nframe,\nand\nthe\ndependent\nfield\nvariables\nare\nthen\nfields\ndefined\nin\nthat\nreference\nframe.\nIn\nvariables\nin\nthe\nunprimed\nframe\nto\nthe\nby\nprimes,\nsince\ntheir\nrelation\ngeneral,\nthese\nmust\nbe\ndesignated\nis\nnot\nknown.\nFor\nFor\nthe\nthe\npurpose\nnurnose\nof o\nwriting\nwritina\nthe\nthe\nprimed\nnrimd\nequations\nenuations\nof of\nelectrodynamics\nelctrod-ax cs\nco-\nin in\nterms\ntems\nof of\nthe\nthe\nun u-\nrimed\nrime\nordinates, recognize that\nV' + V\nA\na\n)+\n-\n= al\"\na-)+\n(- + u*V)A\n-\n+ uV*A - Vx (ux A)\n(+\n(\nuV9\nt +\n+Vu\n+\nE at\nThe left relations follow by using the chain rule of differentiation and the transformation of Eq. 1.\nThat the spatial derivatives taken with respect to one frame must be the same as those with respect\nto the other frame physically means that a single \"snapshot\" of the physical process would be all\nrequired to evaluate the spatial derivatives in either frame. There would be no way of telling which\nframe was the one from which the snapshot was taken. By contrast, the time rate of change for an\nobserver in the primed frame is, by definition, taken with the primed spatial coordinates held fixed.\nIn terms of the fixed frame coordinates, this is the convective derivative defined with Eqs. 2.4.5\nand 2.4.6. However, v in these equations is in general a function of space and time. In the context\nof this section it is saecialized to the constant u. Thus, in rewriting the convective derivatives o\nEq. 2 the constancy of u and a vector identity (Eq. 16, Appendix B) have been used.\nSo far, what has been said in this section is a matter of coordinates. Now, a physically motiva\npostulate is made concerning the electromagnetic laws. Imagine one electromagnetic experiment that i\nto be described from the two different reference frames. The postulate is that provided each of these\nframes is inertial, the governing laws must take the same form. Thus, Eqs. 23-27 apply with [V - V',\nc(\n)/at - a(\n)/at'] and all dependent variables primed. By way of comparing these laws to those ex-\npressed in the fixed-frame, Eqs. 2 are used to rewrite these expressions in terms of the unprimed in-\ndependent variables. Also, the moving-frame material velocity is rewritten in terms of the unprimed\nframe velocity using the relation\nv'\nv-\nu\nThus, the laws originally expressed in the primed frame of reference become\nV.e E'\nE\n-V.P'\n+ p\nV x i' =\nf\nV x E' = 0\nV*o\nH'\n-V.o0 M'\nal H0'\nay M'\nV.

Similarly, Eq. 5b is used to write Eq. 6b. For the one experi-\nment under consideration, these equations will.predict the same behavior as the fixed frame laws,\nEqs. 2.3.23-27, if the identification is made:\nSec.\n2.5\nthe\nf\nted\ns\n\nE- ,\nMQS\n'-\nA\n(9)\n4.\n+\nPE' = P\nM' = M\n(10)\nJ\n= Jf\n(11)\n4.\n+\nS= J\nE'= E + ux\n-\n(12)\nUpf\npoH\nH' .'A-i x eE\n(13)\no\nand hence, from Eq. 2.2.6\nand hence, from Eq. 2.2.7\nD' =D\nB' = B\n(14)\nThe primary fields are the same whether viewed from one frame or the other. Thus, the EQS elec-\ntric field polarization density and charge density are the same in both frames, as are the MQS mag-\nnetic field, magnetization density and current density. The respective dynamic laws can be associated\nwith those field transformations that involve the relative velocity. That the free current density\nis altered by the relative motion of the net free charge in the EQS system is not surprising. But, it\nis the contribution of this same convection current to Ampere's law that generates the velocity depend-\nent contribution to the EQS magnetic field measured in the moving frame of reference. Similarly, the\nvelocity dependent contribution to the MQS electric field transformation is a direct consequence of\nFaraday's law.\nThe transformations, like the quasistatic laws from which they originate, are approximate. It\nwould require Lorentz transformations to carry out a similar procedure for the exact electrodynamic\nlaws of Sec. 2.2. The general laws are not invariant in form to a Galilean transformation, and there-\nin is the origin of special relativity. Built in from the start in the quasistatic field laws is a\nself-consistency with other Galilean invariant laws describing mechanical continua that will be brought\nin in later chapters.\n2.6 Integral Theorems\nSeveral integral theorems prove useful, not only in the description of electromagnetic fields but\nalso in dealing with continuum mechanics and electromechanics. These theorems will be stated here with-\nout proof.\nIf it is recognized that the gradient operator is defined such that its line integral between two\nendpoints (a) and (b) is simply the scalar function evaluated at the endpoints, thenl\nI w4=\n-M)\n(1)\na\nTwo more familiar theorems1 are useful in dealing with vector functions. For a closed surface S, en-\nclosing the volume V, Gauss' theorem states that\nV*AdV =\n'-nda\n(2)\nV\nS\nwhile Stokes's theorem pertains to an open surface S with the contour C as its periphery:\nSV x A-1da =\nA '\n(3)\nS\nC\nIn stating these theorems, the normal vector is defined as being outward from the enclosed voluge for\nGauss' theorem, and the contour is taken as positive in a direction such that It is related to n by the\nright-hand rule. Contours, surfaces, and volumes are sketched in Fig. 2.6.1.\nA possibly less familiar theorem is the generalized Leibnitz rule.2 In those cases where the\nsurface is itself a function of time, it tells how to take the derivative with respect to time of the\nintegral over an open surface of a vector function:\n1.

This process\nbe readily visualized in terms of the surface and contour sketch in Fig. 2.6.1c if the contour C is\npictured as the draw-string on a bag. Then, if C\nV-1, and use is made of Gauss' theorem (Eq. 2),\nEq. 4 becomes a statement of how to take the time derivative of a volume integral when the volume is\nfunction of time:\ndV = f\ndV +\ns. nda\n(5)\ntV\nVt\nS\nAgain, vs is the velocity of the surface enclosing the volume V.\n2.7 quasistatic Integral Laws\nThere are at least three reasons for desiring Maxwell's equations in integral form. First, th\nintegral equations are convenient for establishing jump conditions implied by the differential\nequations. Second, they are the basis for defining lumped parameter variables such as the voltage,\ncharge, current, and flux. Third, they are useful in understanding (as opposed to predicting) physi\nprocesses. Since Maxwell's equations have already been divided into the two quasistatic systems, i\nis now possible to proceed in a straightforward way to write the integral laws for contours, surface\nand volumes which are distorting, i.e., that are functions of time. The velocity of a surface S is\nTo obtain the integral laws implied by the laws of Eqs. 2.3.23-27, each equation is either\n(i) integrated over an open surface S with Stokes's theorem used where the integrand is a curl opera\nto convert to a line integration on C and Eq. 2.6.4 used to bring the time derivative outside the\nintegral, or (ii) integrated over a closed volume V with Gauss' theorem used to convert integrations\nof a divergence operator to integrals over closed surfaces S and Eq. 2.6.5 used to bring the time\nderivative outside the integration:\n(E\n(E\n+ P).-da =\nfdV\nH.\n= IJ f da\n(1)\nS\nV\nC\nS\n110 (H + M).nda - 0\n(2)\nS\nJnda\nI\nfdV = 0\n.\n-o(H\n+ M)*nda\n(3)\nS\nV\nC\nS\n-\nOPM x (:v- ).h%\nC\nty\nical.\n.\ncan\na\ne\ncal\nt\ns,\nv .\ntor\nSecs. 2.6 & 2.7\n2.10\n\nH 1.£ = J i.nda +\n(e E + P).n'da\nSf.-nda = 0\nC\nS\nS\nS\n+ F P x (v -\n')*\nC\nSJo(H + M)-nda = 0\n+ P).nda =\nPfdV\nS\nV\nwhere\nwhere\nx\n4' -E+\n.s\nJ-\nJ\nE' -E+v\nxIIH\n- VsPf\n+\n4 . -\n4.\nH' =H v x sE\ns\no\nThe primed variables are simply summaries of the variables found in deducing these equations. However,\nthese definitions are consistent with the transform relationships found in Sec. 2.5, and the velocity\nof these surfaces and contours, vs, can be identified with the velocity of an inertial frame instan-\ntaneously attached to the surface or contour at the point in question. Approximations implicit to the\noriginal differential quasistatic laws are now implicit to these integral laws.\n2.8 Polarization of Moving Media\nEffects of polarization and magnetization are included in the formulation of electrodynamics\npostulated in Sec. 2.2.\nIn this and the next section a review is made of the underlying models.\nConsider the electroquasistatic systems, where the dominant field source is the charge density.\nNot all of this charge is externally accessible, in the sense that it cannot all be brought to some\nposition through a conduction process. If an initially neutral dielectric medium is stressed by an\nelectric field, the constituent molecules and domains become polarized. Even though the material\nretains its charge neutrality, there can be a local accrual or loss of charge because of the polariza-\ntion. The first order of business is to deduce the relation of such polarization charge to the polari-\nzation density.\nFor conceptual purposes, the polarization of a material is pictured as shown in Fig. 2.8.1.\nFig. 2.8.1.\nModel for dipoles fixed to deformable material. The model pictures\nthe negative charges as fixed to the material, and then the positive\nhalves of the dipoles fixed to the negative charges through internal\nconstraints.\n2.11\nSecs. 2.7 & 2.8\n\nFig. 2.8.2\nPolarization results in net\ncharges passing through a\nsurface.\nThe molecules or domains are represented by dipoles composed of positive and negative charges +q,\nseparated by the vector distance 1. The dipole moment is then $ = qp\n, and if the particles have a\nnumber density n, the polarization density is defined as\nP = nqa\n(1)\nIn the most common dielectrics, the polarization results because of the application of an external\nelectric field.\nIn that case, the internal constraints (represented by the springs in Fig. 2.8.1)\nmake the charges essentially coincident in the absence of an electric field, so that, on the average,\nthe material is (macroscopically) neutral. Then,.with the application of the electric field, there\nis a separation of the charges in some direction which might be coincident with the applied electric\nfield intensity. The effect of the dipoles on the average electric field distribution is equivalent\nto that of the medium they model.\nTo see how the polarization charge density is related to the polarization density, consider the\nmotion of charges through the arbitrary surface S shown in Fig. 2.8.2. For the moment, consider the\nsurface as being closed, so that the contour enclosing the surface shown is shrunk to zero. Because\npolarization results in motion of the positive charge, leaving behind the negative image charge, the net\npolarization charge within the volume V enclosed by the surface S is equal to the negative of the net\ncharge having left the volume across the surface S. Thus,\nf\npdV = -\nnq.i~da = -\n*\"-da\n(2)\nP\nJ\nJ\nS\nS\nGauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, converts the surface integral to one over the arbitrary volume V. It\nfollows that the integrand must vanish so that\n4.\np\n= -\nV.P\n(3)\nThis polarization charge density is now added to the free charge density as a source of the electric\nfield intensity in Gauss' law:\nV.E = Pf + Pp\n(4)\nand Eqs. 3 and 4 comprise the postulated form of Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a.\nBy definition, polarization charge is conserved, independent of the free charge. Hence, the\npolarization current I is defined such that it satisfies the conservation equation\np\nap p\nV*J + at-= 0\np\n(5)\nat\nTo establish the way in which J transforms between inertial reference frames, observe that in a primed\nframe of reference, by dint of Eq. 2.5.2c, the conservation of polarization charge equation becomes\nBap'\nV.

Even if the material is fixed, but the applied field is\nSec. 2.8\n2.12\n\ntime-varying so as to induce a time-varying polarization density, a given surface is crossed by a net\ncharge and there is a current caused by a time-varying polarization density. The following steps\ndetermine the current density 1p in terms of the polarization density and the material velocity.\nThe starting point is the statement\nS-nda =\nP.nda\n(8)\nP\nddt f\nS\nS\nThe surface S, depicted by Fig. 2.8.2, is attached to the material itself. It moves with the\nnegative charges of the dipoles. Integrated over this deforming surface of fixed identity, the polari-\nzation current density evaluated in the frame of reference of the material is equal to the rate of\nchange with respect to time of the net charge penetrating that surface.\nWith the surface velocity identified with the material velocity, Eq. 2.6.4 and Eq. 3 convert\nEq. 8 to\na f\nt\nP\nap+\n+ f ' x v.\n(9)\nS\nS\nOn the left, J' is replaced by Eq. 7 evaluated with u = v, while on the right Stokes's theorem,\nEq. 2.6.3, is Rsed to convert the line integral to a surface integral. The result is an equation in\nsurface integrals alone. Although fixed to the deforming material, the surface S is otherwise arbitrary\nand so it follows that the required relation between 3p and I for the moving material is\n+\n+10\n1P\nJ =\n+\np\nV x (P\n)\n(10)\nat\nIt is this current density that has been added to the right-hand side of Ampere's law, Eq. 2.3.26a,\nto complete the formulation of polarization effects in the electroquasistatic system.\n2.9 Magnetization of Moving Media\nIt is natural to use polarization charge to represent the effect of macroscopic media on the\nmacroscopic electric field. Actually, this is one of two alternatives for representing polarization.\nThat such a choice has been made becomes clear when the analogous question is asked for magnetization.\nIn the absence of magnetization, the free current density is the source of the magnetic field, and it\nis therefore natural to represent the macroscopic effects of magnetizable media on y through an equi-\nvalent magnetization current density. Indeed, this viewpoint is often used and supported by the con-\ntention that what is modeled at the atomic level is really a system of currents (the electrons in their\norbits).\nIt is important to understand that the use of equivalent currents, or of equivalent magnetic\ncharge as used here, if carried out self-consistently, results in the same predictions of physical\nprocesses. The choice of models in no way hinges on the microscopic processes accounting for the mag-\nnetization. Moreover, the magnetization is often dominated by dynamical processes that have more to do\nwith the behavior of domains than with individual atoms, and these are most realistically pictured as\nsmall magnets (dipoles). With the Chu formulation postulated in Sec. 2.2, the dipole model for\nrepresenting magnetization has been adopted.\nAn advantage of the Chu formulation is that magnetization is developed in analogy to polarization.\nBut rather than starting with a magnetic charge density, and deducing its relation to the polarization\ndensity, think of the magnetic material as influencing the macroscopic fields through an intrinsic flux\ndensity poi that might be given, or might be itself induced by the macroscopic A. For lack of evidence\nto support the existence of \"free\" magnetic monopoles, the total flux density due to all macroscopic\nfields must be solenoidal. Hence, the intrinsic flux density 'o\n4 0 , added to the flux density in free\nspace Plo,\nmust have no divergence:\nV.*o(, + M) = 0\n(1)\nThis is Eq. 2.3.24b.\nIt is profitable to think of -V.poM as a source of H. That is, Eq. 1 can\nbe written to make it look like Gauss' law for the electric field:\nV\nH4H\n= pm; Pm = -V'Vo0\n(2)\nThe magnetic charge density pm is in this sense the source of the magnetic field intensity.\nFaraday's law of induction must be revised if magnetization is present.\nIf\no-M is a magnetic flux\ndensity, then, through magnetic induction, its rate of change is capable of producing an induced electric\nfield intensity. Also, if Faraday's law of induction were to remain valid without alteration, then its\ndivergence must be consistent with Eq. 1; obviously, it is not.\nSecs. 2.8 & 2.9\n2.13\n\nTo generalize the law of induction to include magnetization, it is stated in integral form for a\ncontour C enclosing a surface S fixed to the material in which the magnetized entities are imbedded.\nThen, because 1o(A + M) is the total flux density,\n=E'*£\n= - d\nO(H + M)*nda\nThe electric field E' is evaluated in the frame of reference of the moving contour.

Fields are similarly often given a piece-\nwise representation with jump conditions used to \"splice\" them together at the discontinuities. These\nconditions, derived here for reference, are implied by the integral laws. They guarantee that the\nassociated differential laws are satisfied through the singular region of the discontinuity.\nA 71\nFig. 2.10.1.\nVolume element enclosing a boundary. Dimen-\nsions of area A are much greater than A.\nElectroquasistatic Jump Conditions: A section of the boundary can be enclosed by a volume elemen\nhaving the thickness A and cross-sectional area A, as depicted by Fig. 2.10.1. The linear dimensions o\nthe cross-sectional area A are, by definition, much greater than the thickness A. Implicit to this\nstatement is the assumption that, although the surface can be curvilinear, its radius of curvature must\nbe much greater than a characteristic thickness over which variations in the properties and fields take\nplace.\nThe normal vector n used in this section is a unit vector perpendicular to the boundary and direc\nfrom region b to region a, as.shown in Fig. 2.10.1.

Thus, with volume charges to either side of the interface, there is an\nupt change in the rate of change of the electric field intensity normal to the boundary, but the\nld is itself continuous. On the other hand, as illustrated by the sketches of Fig. 2.10.2b, if\nre is an appreciable charge per unit area within the boundary, the electric field intensity is\ncontinuous, and undergoes a step discontinuity.\n2.15\nSec. 2.10\nHer\nas\nwhe\ncha\nThe\ncan\nis\nabr\nfie\nthe\ndis\n\nA somewhat less familiar situation is that of Fig. 2.10.2c. Within the boundary there are\nregions of large positive and negative charge concentrations with an associated intense electric field\nbetween. In the limit where the boundary becomes very thin, a component of the surface charge density\nbecomes a doublet, and the electric field becomes an impulse.\nThe double layer can be pictured as being positive surface charges disposed on one side of the\nboundary, and negative surface charges distributed on the other, with an internal component of the\nelectric field originating on the positive charges and terminating on the negative ones. The mag-\nnitude of the double layer is equal to the product of the positive surface charge density and the dis-\ntance between these layers, A. In the limit where the layer thickness becomes infinitely thin while th\ndouble-layer magnitude remains constant, the electric field within the double layer must approach\ninfinity. Thus, associated with the doublet of charge density, there is an impulse in the electric fie\nintensity, as sketched in Fig. 2.10.2c.\nThe boundary condition to be used in connection with a double layer is found from Eq. 1 by lettin\nm = 1. The left-hand side of Eq. 1 can be integrated by parts, so that it becomes\nf V.(EoV\n)dV - f\nE.*VvdV =\nV(pf + p )dV\n(4)\nV\nV\nV\nFor the incremental volume, the surface double layer density is defined as\np\nlim 1 f v(pf + pp)dV =\nv(p + p )dv\n(5)\nand so the right-hand side of Eq. 4 is ApE. The origin of the A axis remains to be defined but A\nv\nTo glean a jump condition from the equation, the second EQS law is incorporated. That I is irrotation\nEq. 2.3.24a, is represented by defining the electric potential\nE = -VO\n(6)\nThus, the second term on the left in Eq. 4 becomes\nJe E*VvdV = -\nVO*VvdV\n= - f\nV*(OVv)dV + fE V vdV\n(7)\nV\nV\nV\nV\nEvaluation of V2v gives nothing because v is defined as a local Cartesian coordinate. The last inte-\ngral vanishes, and with the application of Gauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, it follows that Eq. 4 becomes\nr\nV-.t da + f e IVv.i da - Ap\n(8)\nSo\nn\no\nn\nA\nS\nS\nProvided that within the layer, E parallel to the interface and Q are finite (not impulses in the limit\nA÷0), Eq. 8 only has contributions to the surface integrals from the regions to either side of the inte\nface. Thus,\nAEo(vEa -\nv Eb).\n+ Ae 0\n= ApE\n(9)\nThe origin of the v axis is adjusted to make the first term vanish. The required boundary condition\nto be associated with Eqs. 2.3.23a and 2.3.23b is\no II D = EP\n(10)\nThe gradient of Eq. 10 within the plane of the interface converts the jump condition to one in\nterms of the electric field:\nEo a\nID\n- VEZE\n(11)\nHere VE is the surface gradient and t denotes components tangential to the interfacial plane.\nIn the absence of a double-layer surface density, these last two boundary conditions are the\nfamiliar statement that the tangential electric field intensity at a boundary must be continous. The\nstatement given in Eq. 10 that the potential must be continuous at a boundary is another way of statin\nSec. 2.10\n2.16\ne\nld\ng\n-v\nal,\nr-\ng\n\nthis requirement on the tangential electric field intensity. With a double layer, the tangential elec-\ntric field intensity is discontinuous, as is also the potential.\nEquations 10 and 11 could also be derived using the condition that the line integral of the electric\nfield intensity around a closed loop intersecting the boundary vanish. Usually, the tangential electric\nfield is continuous because there is no contribution to this line integral from those segments of the\ncontour passing through the boundary. However, with the double layer, the electric field intensity with-\nin the boundary is infinite; so, even though the segments of the line integral across the boundary vanish\nas A -\n0, there is a net contribution from these segments of the integration.\nIt is clear that higher order singularities could also be handled by considering values of m in\nEq. 1 greater than unity. However, the doublet is as singular a charge distribution as of interest\nphysically.\nThere are two reasons for wishing to include the doublet charge distribution, one mathematical and\none physical. Just as the surface charge density is a singularity in the volume charge density which\ncan be used to terminate a normal electric field intensity at a boundary, the double layer is a termination\nof a tangential electric field. On the physical side, there are many situations in which a double layer\nactually exists within a very thin region of material. Double layers abound at interfaces between liquids\nand metals and between metals. The double-layer concept is useful for modeling electromechanical coupling\ninvolving these interfacial regions.\nSo far, those EQS laws have been considered that do not explicitly involve time rates of change.\nConservation of charge does involve a dynamic term. Its associated boundary conditions can therefore\nbe derived only by making further stipulations as to the nature of the boundary. It is now admitted that\nthe boundary can, in general, be one which is deforming. Because time did not appear explicitly in the\nprevious derivations of this section, the conditions derived are automatically appropriate, even if the\nboundary is moving.\nThe integral form of charge conservation, Eq. 2.7.3a, is written for a volume V and surface S\ntied to the material itself.\nThus, with _\n+ -,\n( J\n- pf-V)ida = -\np dV\n(12)\nS\nV\nAs seen in Fig. 2.10.1, the volume of integration always encloses material of fixed identity and inter-\nsects the boundary. Implicit to this statement is the assumption that the boundary is one of demarca-\ntion between material regions. The material velocity is presumed to at most have a step singularity\nacross the boundary.\n(It is important to recognize that there are other types of boundaries. For\nexample, the boundary could be a shock front, with a gas moving through from one side of the interface\nto the other. In that case, the boundary conditions thus far derived would remain correct, because no\nmention has yet been made of the physical nature of the boundary.)\nThe left-hand side of Eq. 12 can be handled in a manner similar to that already illustrated, since\nit does not involve time rates of change. The integration is divided into two parts: one over the upper\nand lower surfaces of the volume, the other over the parts of the surface which intersect the boundary.\nThe contributions to a current flow through these side surfaces comes from a surface current.\nIt follows\nby using a two-dimensional form of Gauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, that the left-hand side of Eq. 12 is\nf (J - PfV)T. nda + J i\n- Pfy).\nda = A{n.\n- vpf0 + V\nf -\nvt)}\n(13)\nS'+S\"\nS\"'\nHere, A is the area of intersection between the volume element and the boundary. The right-hand side of\nEq. 12 is, by the definition of Eq. 3,\nSjpfdV =~\nafda\n(14)\nV\nA\nNote that, if the volume of integration V, and hence the area of integration A, is one always fixed to\nthe material, then the area A is time-varying. The surface charge density is a function only of the\ntwo dimensions within the plane of the interface. Thus, the term on the right in Eq. 14 is a time\nderivative of a two-dimensional integral. This is a two-dimensional special case of the situation\ndescribed by the generalized Leibnitz rule, Eq. 2.6.5, which stated how the time derivative of a volume\nintegral could be represented, even if the volume of integration were time-varying. Thus, Eq. 14 becomes\n=\ndt PfdV\nA [-\n+ V(vt f)\n(15)\n2.1\n2.17\nSec. 2.10\n\nFinally, with the use of Eqs. 13 and 15, Eq. 12 becomes the required jump condition representing charge\nconservation:\nSJfPfV\n- p\n+ VK f =\nt\n(16)\nBy contrast with Eqs. 10 and 11, the expression is specialized to interfaces that do not support charge\ndistributions so singular as a double layer. In using Eq. 16, note that a partial derivative with\nrespect to time is usually defined as one taken holding the spatial coordinates constant. A review of\nthe derivation of Eq. 16 will make it clear that such is not the significance of the partial derivative\non the right in Eq. 16. The surface charge density is not defined throughout the three-dimensional\nspace. Thus, this derivative means the partial derivative with respect to time, holding the coordinate\nwithin the plane of the interface constant.\nThe component of current normal to the boundary represented by the first term in Eq. 16 will be\nrecognized as the free current density in a frame of reference moving with the boundary. A good questi\nwould be, \"why is it that the normal current density appears in Eq. 16 evaluated in the primed frame of\nreference, while the surface free current density is not?\" The answer points to the physical situation\nfor which Eq. 16 is appropriate. As the material boundary moves in the normal direction, the material\nahead and behind carries a charge distribution along, but one that never reaches the boundary.

Thus, the surface divergence appearing in the second\nterm of Eq. 16 can include both a conduction surface current and a convection surface current.\nMagnetoquasistatic Jump Conditions: The integral forms of Ampere's law and Gauss' law for magneti\nfields incorporate no time rates of change. Hence, the jump conditions implied by these laws are\nfamiliar from elementary electrodynamics. Ampere's law, Eq. 2.7.1b, is integrated over the surface S\nand around the contour C enclosing the boundary, as sketched in Fig, 2.10.3, to obtain\nS\n= K\n(17)\nwhere Kf is the surface current density. Although it is entirely possible to consider a doublet of\ncurrent density as a model, this impulsive singularity in the distribution of free current density is\nof as high an order as necessary to model MQS electromechanical situations of general interest.\nFrom Gauss' law for magnetic fields, Eq. 2.7.2b,\napplied to the incremental volume enclosing the interface,\nFig. 2.10.1, the jump condition is\n*1\no(H\nW + WIf = 0\n(18)\nFaraday's law of induction brings into play the time\nrate of change, and it is expected that motion of the\nboundary leads to an addition to the jump condition not\nfound for stationary media.

Consistent with Eq. 17 is the assumption\nthat it can be carrying a surface current with it as it deforms.\nIf the surface S were not one of fixe\nidentity, this would mean that the surface integral on the right could be a step function of time as th\nboundary passed through the surface of integration. The result would be a temporal impulse on the righ\nwhich would make a contribution to the boundary condition even in the limit where the surface S becomes\nvanishingly small.\nBy contrast, because the surface S is one of fixed identity, in the limit where the\nsurface area vanishes, the right-hand side of Eq. 19 makes no contribution.\nWith the assumption that fields and velocity are at most step functions across the boundary, the\nintegral on the left in Eq. 19 gives\nnix\nl+ v+ x p0DH\n= 0\n(20)\nThis expression is what would be expected, in view of the transformation law for the electric field in\ns\nor\nc\nd\ne\nt\nSec. 2.10\n2.18\n\nthe MQS system.

Then, the direc-\ntion of the normal vector (and hence the positive flux) to the surface Sienclosed by the contour Ci\nfollowed by the current ii,has a direction consistent with the right-hand rule, as Fig. 2.12.1 illus-\ntrates.\nBecause the MQS current density is solenoidal, the same current flows through the cross section\nof the wire at any point. Thus, the terminal current is defined by\n= f J\nin\nda\n(2)\nsi\nwhere the surface si intersects all of the cross section of the wire at any point, as illustrated in the\nfigure.\nThe first two MQS equations are sufficient to determine the flux linkages as a function of the cur-\nrent excitations and the geometry of the coil.

Note that the reference electrode is not in-\ncluded in the summation, because the electric potential on that electrode is, by definition, zero. The\nwork required to place a free charge at its final position correctly accounts for the polarization,\nbecause the polarization charges induced in carrying the free charges to their final position are re-\nflected in the potential.\nConsider now the field representation of the electroquasistatic stored energy. From Gauss' law\n(Eq. 2.3.23a), the contribution of the summation in Eq. 3 can be represented in terms of an integral\nover the surfaces Si of the electrodes:\nn\n6w = E\n.i6D.nda\n+ f6pfdV\ni=l\ni DJ\nHere, Di is the potential on the surface Si .\nThe surfaces enclosing the electrodes can be joined to-\ngether at infinity, as shown in Fig. 2.13.1. The resulting simply connected surface encloses all of the\nelectrodes, the wires as they extend to infinity, with the surface completed by a closure at infinity.\nThus, the surface integration called for with the first term on the right in Eq. 4 can be represented\nby an integration over a closed surface. Gauss' theorem is then used to convert this surface integral\nto a volume integration. However, note that the normal vector used in Eq. 4 points into the volume V'\nexcluded by the electrodes and included by the surface at infinity. Thus, in using Gauss' theorem,\na minus sign is introduced and Eq. 4 becomes\n6w = - J V* (6'D)dV + J c6pfdV = f [-WV.6D - 6D-VO + 06pf]dV\nV'\nVI\nV'\nIn rewriting the integral, the identity V*.C = C.VQ + yV-V has been used.\nFrom Gauss' law, 6pf = 6V.D = V*6D.\nIt follows that the first and last terms in Eq. 5 cancel.\nAlso, the electric field is irrotational (\n= -VW).\nSo Eq. 5 becomes\n6w =\nE.6DdV\nV\nThere is no E inside the electrodes, so the integration is now over all of the volume V.\nThe integrand in Eq. 6 is an energy density, and it is therefore appropriate to define the in-\ncremental change in electric energy density as\n6W = E*D\n2.23\nSec. 2.13\n\nThe field representation of the energy, as given by Eqs. 6 and 7, should be compared to that\nlumped parameters.

Then, the second term in Eq.\nwould be zero, and the incremental change in energy would be given by the first term:\nn\n6w = E vijqi\nComparison of Eqs. 6 and 8 suggests that the electric field plays a role analogous to the terminal\nwhile the displacement vector is the analog of the charge on the electrodes. If the relationship\nthe variables P and t, or v and q, is single-valued, then the energy density and the total energy\ncontinuum and lumped parameter systems can be viewed, respectively, as integrals or areas under cu\nas sketched in Fig. 2.13.2.\nIf it is more convenient to have all of the voltages,\nrather than the charges, as independent variables, then\nLegendre's dual transformation can be used.

If the charge is distributed throughout the volume, Eq. 6 remains valid.\nWith the notion of electrical energy storage goes the concept of a conservative subsystem.\nthe process of building up free charges on perfectly conducting electrodes or slowly conducting ch\nto the bulk positions (one mechanism for carrying out the process pictured abstractly by Eq. 3), t\nwork is stored much as it would be in cocking a spring. The electrical energy, like that of the s\ncan later be released (discharged). Included in the subsystem is storage in the polarization. Fo\nwork done on polarizable entities to be stored, this polarization process must also be reversible.\nit is profitable to think of the dipoles as internally constrained by spring-like nondissipative\nelements, capable of releasing energy when the polarizing field is turned off. Mathematically, th\nrestriction on the nature of the polarization is brought in by requiring that y and hence y be a s\nvalued function of the instantaneous g, or that e = 2($). In lumped parameter systems, this is ta\nmount to q = q(v) or v = v(q).\nPower Flow: The electric and polarization energy storage subsystem is the field theory gener\ntion of a capacitor. Just as practical circuits involve a capacitor interconnected with resistors\nand other types of elements, in any actual physical system the ideal energy storage subsystem is i\nbedded with and coupled to other subsystems. The field equations, like Kirchhoff's laws in circui\ntheory, encompass all of these subsystems. The following discussion is based on forming quadrati\nexpressions from the field laws, and hence relate to the energy balance between subsystems.\nFor a geometrical part of the ith subsystem, having the volume V enclosed by the surface S,\nstatement of power flow takes the integral form\nat\niin)da +\ni- dV =V idV\n(12)\nS\nV\nfor\nvoltage,\nbetween\nin the\nrves\nor D\non\nW'\no-\nIn\narge\nhe\npring,\nr\nHere,\nis\ningle-\nnta-\naliza-\nm-\nt\nc\na\nSec. 2.13\n2.24\n\nHere, Si is the power flux density, Wi is the energy density, and *i is the dissipation density.\nDifferent subsystems can occupy the same volume V. In Eq. 12, V is arbitrary, while i distinguishes\nthe particular physical processes considered. The differential form of Eq. 12 follows by applying Gauss'\ntheorem to the first term and (because V is arbitrary) setting the integrand to zero:\naw\nSi +at\ni\n(13)\nThis is a canonical form which will be used to describe various subsystems. In a given region, Wi can\nincrease with time either because of the volumetric source #i or because of a power flux -§:'i into the\nregion across its bordering surfaces.\nFor an electrical lumped parameter terminal pair, power is the product of voltage and current. This\nserves as a clue for finding a statement of power flow from the basic laws.\nThe generalization of the\nvoltage is the potential, while conservation of charge as expressed by Eq. 2.3.25a brings in the free\ncurrent density. So, the sum of Eqs. 2.3.25a and the conservation of polarization charge equation,\nEq. 2.8. 5, is multiplied by 0 to obtain\n[V. (f+J\n+\n(p + pp)] = 0\n(14)\nWith the objective an expression having the form of Eq. 13, a vector identity (Eq. 15, Appendix B)\nand Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a, convert Eq. 14 to\nV. [ (J + J )] + E.

Note that We does not include energy stored by polarizing the medium. Also, it can\nbe shown that V.Se = V.(1 x f), so that 1e is the poynting vector familiar from conventional classical\nelectrodynamics. In the dissipation density, I-.f can represent work done on an external mechanical\nsystem due to polarization forces or, if the polarization process involves dissipation, heat energy\ngiven up to a thermal subsystem.\nThe polarization terms in Oe can also represent energy storage in the polarization. This is illus-\ntrated by specializing Eq. 16 to describe a subsystem in which - is a single-valued function of the\ninstantaneous -, the free current density is purely ohmic, f = at, and the medium is at rest. Then, the\npolarization term from 4e can be lumped with the energy density term to describe power flow in a subsystem\nthat includes energy storage in the polarization:\nawE\nV.E + at\nE\n(17)\nwhere\nS\nQ\n+ aD\nWE\nEE\nEE\no\n2.25\nSec. 2.13\n\nNote that the integral defining the energy density WE, which is consistent with Eq. 7, involves an i\ngrand t which is time dependent only through the time dependence of 8: 1 = '[f(t)].\nThus, aWE/at =\nE.(-/at).\nWith the power flux density placed on the right, Eq. 17 states that the energy density decreas\nbecause of electrical losses (note that *E < 0) and because of the divergence of the power density.\n2.14\nConservation of Magnetoquasistatic Energy\nFundamentally, the energy stored in a magnetic field involves the same work done by moving a t\ncharge from a reference position to the position of interest as was the starting point in Sec. 2.13.\nBut, the same starting point leads to an entirely different form of energy storage. In a magnetoquas\nstatic system, the net free charge is a quantity evaluated after the fact. A self-consistent repres\ntion of the fields is built upon a statement of current continuity, Eq. 2.3.26b, in which the free\ncharge density is ignored altogether. Yet, the energy stored in a magnetic field is energy stored i\ncharges transported against an electric field intensity. The apparent discrepancy in these statemen\nresolved by recognizing that the charges of interest in a magnetoquasistatic system are at least of\ntwo species, with the charge density of one species alone far outweighing the net charge density.\nThermodynamics: Because the free current density is solenoidal, a current \"tube\" can be define\nshown in Fig. 2.14.1. This tube is defined with a cross section having a normal yn in the direction\nthe local current density, and a surrounding surface having a normal perpendicular to the local curr\ndensity. An example of a current tube is a wire surrounded by insulation and hence carrying a total\nrent i which is the same at one cross section as at another.\nFig. 2.14.1\nCurrent tube defined as having\ncross-sectional area ds per-\nt\nthe\nto\npendicular\ndensity, and an outside surface\nwith a normal vector perpendicular\nto the current density.\ni\nFor bipolar conduction, and a stationary medium, the current density within the tube is relate\nto the charge density by the expression\n4.\nJf = pv+ - pv_\n(1)\nHere the conduction process is visualized as involving two types of carriers, one positive, with a c\ndensity p+, and the other negative, with a magnitude p-. The carriers then have velocities which ar\nrespectively, v+ and\n_..\nEven though there is a current density, in the magnetoquasistatic system t\nis essentially no net charge: pf = p+ -\np- = 0. In an increment of time 6t, the product of the resp\ncharge densities and net displacements is p+v+6t and - p.0.6t. The work done on the charges as they\nundergo these displacements is the energy stored in magnetic form. This work is computed by recogni\nthat the force on each of the charged species is the product of the charge density and the electric\nfield intensity. Hence, the energy stored in the field by a length of the current tube d£ is to fi\norder in differentials dt and ds,\n-(pv\n-p_v\n).E6tdsdi = -Jf *E6tdsdk\n(2)\nThe expression for the free current density, Eg. i, is used on the right to restate the energy store\nin the increment of time 6t.\nThe unit vector In is defined to be the direction of if. Thus, If =\nCf('n)tn. Because the current density is solenoidal, it follows closed paths. The product If.tnds\nis, by definition, constant along one of these paths, and if Indi is defined as an increment of the\nline integral, it then follows from Eq. 2 that the energy stored in a single current tube is\n(3)\nd(\nC\nnte-\nes\nest\ni-\nenta-\nn\nts is\nd as\nof\nent\ncur-\nd\nharge\ne,\nhere\nective\nzing\nrst\nd\nSecs. 2.13 & 2.14\n2.26\n\nFig. 2.14.2\nXi\nSchematic representation of\na magnetoquasistatic energy\nstorage system. Currents\nare either distributed in\ncurrent loops throughout the\nvolume of interest, or con-\nfined to one of n possible\ncontours connected to the\ndiscrete terminal pairs.\nBy contrast with the electroquasistatic system, in which the electric field intensity is induced\nby the charge density (Gauss' law), the electric field intensity in Eq. 3 is clearly rotational. This\nemphasizes the essential role played by Faraday's law of magnetic induction.\nIt is helpful to have in mind at least the abstraction of a physical system. Figure 2.14.2 shows\na volume of interest in which the currents are either distributed throughout the volume or confined to\nparticular contours (coils), the latter case having been discussed in Sec. 2.12.\nFirst, consider the energy stored in the current paths defined by coils having cross-sectional\narea ds. From Eq. 3, this contribution to the total energy is conveniently written as\n-* .nds(\nE.ndG)6t =\nXi\n(4)\nC.\nFaraday's law and the definition of flux linkage, Eqs. 2.12.1 and 2.12.6, are the basis for representing\nthe line integral as a change in the flux linkage.\nBecause the free current density is solenoidal, the distribution of free currents within the\nvolume V excluded by the discrete coils can be represented as the superposition of current tubes. From\nEq. 4 and the integral form of Faraday's law, Eq. 2.7.3b with vs = v = 0 (the medium is fixed), it\nfollows that the energy stored in a current tube is\nSwcurrent tube = Jf\" ndS (\nA.-da)\n(5)\nStube\nThe magnetic flux density is also solenoidal4 and fog this reason it is convenient to introduce the mag-\nnetic vector potential A, defined such that B = V x A, so that the magnetic flux density is automatically\nsolenoidal. With this representation of the flux density in terms of the vector potential, Stokes's\ntheorem, Eq. 2.6.3, converts Eq. 5 to\nJf.*ds r r 6~A.ld=\n(\n.6A)dsdk =\nJ f.dAdV\n(6)\nCtube\nCtube\nVtube\nHere, f is by definition in the direction of tn, so that Jf.61 takes the component of 61 in the tn direc-\ntion. The second equality is based upon recognition that the product as-It is a volume element of the\ncurrent tube, and the line integration constitutes an integration over the volume, Vtube , of the tube.\nTo include all of the energy stored in the distributed current loops, it is necessary only that\n2.27\nSec. 2.14\n\nthe integral on the right in Eq. 6 be extended over all of the volume occupied by the tubes.\nThe combina-\ntion of the incremental energy stored in the discrete loops, Eq. 4, and that from the distributed current\nloops, Eq. 6, is the incremental total energy of the system\nn\n6w = E\nii\ni +\n.6AdV\n(7)\ni=l i\nIn this expression, V is the volume excluded by the discrete current paths.\nThis incremental magnetic\nenergy storage is analogous to that for the electric field storage represented by Eq, 2.13.3.\nIn retrospect, it is apparent from the derivation that the division into discrete and distributed\ncurrent paths, represented by the two terms in Eq. 7, is a matter of convenience. In representing the\nincremental energy in terms of the magnetic fields alone, it is handy to extend the volume V over all\nof the currents within the volume of interest, including those that might be represented by discrete\nterminal pairs. With this understanding, the incremental change in energy, Eq. 7, is the last term\nonly, with V extended over the total volume. Moreover, Ampere's law represents the current density in\nterms of the magnetic field intensity, and, in turn, the integrand can be rewritten by use of a vector\nidentity (Eq. 8, Appendix B):\n6w =\nV x H.6~dV =\n[H.V x\nA + V.(H x 6iA)]dV\n(8)\nV\nV\nThe last term in Eq. 8 can be converted to a surface integral by using Gauss' theorem. With the\nunderstanding that the system is closed in the sense that the fields fall off rapidly enough at infinity\nso that the surface integration can be ignored, the remaining volume integration on the right in Eq. 8\ncan be used to obtain a field representation of the incremental energy change. With the curl of the\nvector potential converted back to a flux density, Eq. 8 becomes\nw =\nHHf Bdv\n(9)\nV\nThe integrand of Eq. 9 is defined as an incremental magnetic energy density\n6W = H.6B\n(10)\nIt is helpful to note the clear analogy between this energy density and the incremental total energy\nrepresented by lumped parameters.\nIn the absence of volume free current densities that cannot be\nrepresented by discrete terminal pairs, Eq. 7 reduces to the lumped parameter form\nn\n6w =\nE\ni.6X.\n(11)\ni=l\nThe magnetic field intensity plays the continuum role of the discrete terminal currents, and the magnetic\nflux density is the continuum analog of the lumped parameter flux linkages.\nThe situation in this mag-\nnetic case is, of course, analogous to the electrical incremental energy storages in continuum and in\nlumped parameter cases, as discussed with Eqs. 7 and 8 of Sec. 2.13.\nJust as it is often convenient in dealing with electrical lumped parameters to use the voltage\nas an independent variable, so also in magnetic field systems it is helpful to use the terminal currents\nas independent variables. In that case, the coenergy function w' is conveniently introduced as an\nenergy function\nn\n6w' = Z X.6i.\n(12)\ni=l\nIn an analogous way, the co-energy density, w', is defined such that\n6W' = B.6H; W' = H.B - W\n(13)\nPower Flow:\nThus far, the storage of energy in magnetic form has been examined. The postulate\nhas been that all work done in moving the charges against an electric field is stored.\nIn any system\nas a whole this is not likely to be the case.\nThe general magnetoquasistatic laws enable a deduction\nof an equation representing the flow of power, and the rate of change of the stored energy. This places\nSdc. 2.14\n2.28\n\nthe energy storage in the context of a more general system.\nA clue as to how an energy conservation statement might be constructed from the differential mag-\nnetoquasistatic laws is obtained from Eq. 2, which makes it clear that the product of the free current\ndensity and the electric field intensity are closely connected with the statement of conservation of\nenergy. The dot product of the electric field and Ampere's law, Eq. 2.3.23b, is\nE.[V x H -\nJf] - 0\n(14)\nUse of a vector identity 6Eq. 8, Appendix B) makes it possible to rewrite this expression as\n+ H.V\n4.\n4.\n4.\n4. 4.\nx E -\nV.(E x H) = E.Jf\n(15)\nWith the additional use of Faraday's law to represent V x E, Eq. 15 takes the form of Eq. 2.13.16, with\nS EExH\ne\n4.\nWe -\nH\n(16)\n4+\n.+\n4.\no\n+\n-E.J - H.\n-\n.\nx ( Mx\n)\nThese quantities have much the same physical significances discussed in connection with Eq. 2.13.16.\nTo place the magnetic energy storage identified with the thermodynamic arguments in the context of\nan actual system, consider a material which is ohmic and fixed so that 4 = 0 and If = C1. Then the\nsecond term on the right in Eq. 16c is in the form of a time rate of change of magnetization energy\ndensity. Hence, the power flow equation assumes the form of Eq. 2.13.17, with\nWE=\nH*6B\n(17)\no\n=\nSE\n-QE*E\nImplicit is the assumption that H is a single-valued function of the instantaneous B.\nThe resulting\nenergy density includes magnetization energy and is consistent with Eq. 2.14.10.\n2.15 Complex Amplitudes; Fourier. Amplitudes and Fourier Transforms\nThe notion of a continuum network fs introduced for the first time in the next section. The associ-\nated transfer relations illustrated there are a theme throughout the chapters which follow. Among several\nreasons for their use is the organization they lend to the representation of complicated, largely linear,\nsystems. In this chapter, the continuum networks represent electromagnetic fields. Later, they re-\npresent fluid and (to some degree) solid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and electromechanical continua\nin general. These networks make it possible to set aside one part of a given problem, derive the associ-\nated relations once and for all and accumulate these for later use. Such relations will be picked up over\nand over in solving different problems and, properly understood, are a useful reference.\nComplex Amplitudes:\nIn many practical situations, excitations are periodic in one or two spatial\ndirections, in time or in space and time. The complex amplitude representation of fields, useful in\ndealing with these situations, is illustrated by considering the function O(z,t) which has dependence\non z given explicitly by\nO(z,t) = Re y ( t ) e - j k z\n(1)\nWith the wavenumber k real, the spatial distribution is periodic with wavelength X = 2wr/k and spatial\nphase determined by the complex amplitude 1. For example, if\n= y o(t) is real and k is real, then\nO(z,t) =\no0\n0 (t) cos kz.\nThe spatial derivative of 0 follows from Eq. 1 as\nS Re\n(t)e-jkz\n(2)\n7z\nRe.[-JkZ(t)e\n(2\n2.29\nSecs. 2.14 & 2.15\n\nThe following identifications can therefore be made:\nas\nwith it being understood that even though complex amplitudes are being used, the temporal dependence is\narbitrary. There will be occasions where the time dependence is specified, but the space dependence is\nnot.\nFor example, complex amplitudes will take the form\nQ(z,t) = Re4(z)e j wt\n(4)\nwhere D(z) is itself perhaps expressed as a Fourier series or transform (see Sec. 5.16).\nMost.often, complex amplitudes will be used to represent both temporal gnd spatial dependences:\nD(z,t) = Recej(Wt-kz)\n(5)\nThe (angular) frequency w can in general be complex. If 0 is periodic in time with period T, then T =\n2n/w. For complex amplitudes 0, the identifications are:\n[4(z,t),\n(z,t),\n(z,t)]<>[$,-jk(,jj]\n(6)\nIf w and k are real, Eq. 5 represents a traveling wave. At any instant, its wavelength is 2w/k,\nat any position its frequency is w and points of constant phase propagate in the +z direction with the\nphase velocity w/k.\nFourier Amplitudes and Transforms: The relations between complex amplitudes are identical to those\nbetween Fourier amplitudes or between Fourier transforms provided that these are suitably defined. For\na wide range of physical situations it is the spatially periodic response or the temporal sinusoidal\nsteady state that is of interest. Simple combinations of solutions represented by the complex amplitudes\nthen suffice, and there is no need to introduce Fourier concepts. Even so, it is important to recognize\nat the outset that the spatial information required for analysis of excitations with arbitrary spatial\ndistributions is inherent to the transfer relations based on single-complex-amplitude solutions.\nThe Fourier series represents an arbitrary function periodic in z with fundameqtal periodicity\nlength k by a superposition of complex exponentials.\nIn terms of complex Fourier coefficients $n(t),\nsuch a series is\nn z\n-jk\nQ(z,t) =\nE\n(t)e\nk\n2nI/R; Q*\nn\n=\n(7)\nn\nn\nn\n-n\nwhere the condition on n insures that 0 is real. Thus, with the identification\n+ 4n\nn and k + kn, each\ncomplex exponential solution of the form of Eq. 1 can be taken as one term in the Fourier series.\nThe\nmth Fourier amplitude Om follows by multiplying Eq. 7 by the complex conjugate function exp(jkmz) and.\nintegrating over the length k to obtain only one term on the right. This expression can then be solved\nfor ym to obtain the inverse relation\nz+\nJkmz\nim\nO\nQ (z,t)e\ndz\n(8)\nz\nIf the temporal dependence is also periodic, with fundamental period T, the Fourier series can also\nbe used to represent the time dependence in Eq. 7:\n+i\n+o\nJ wmt-knz)\nO(z,t)=\nE\nE\ne\n;\n*\n= 8\n(9)\nmn\nmn\n-m-n\nm=--\nn=--\nwhere the condition on the amplitudes insures that O(z,t) is real. One component out of this double sum-\nmation is the traveling-wave solution represented by the complex amplitude form, Eq. 5. The rules given\nby Eqs. 3 and 6 pertain either to the complex amplitudes or the Fourier coefficients.\nThe Fourier transform is convenient if the dependence is not periodic.

Surfaces enclosing these regions are often planar, cylindrical or\nspherical, with the volume then taking the form of a planar layer, a cylindrical annulus or a spherical\nshell. Such volumes and bounding surfaces are illustrated in Tables 2.16.1-3. The question answered\nin this section is: given the potential on the bounding surfaces, what are the associated normal flux\ndensities? Of immediate interest is the relation of the electric potentials to the normal displace-\nment vectors. But also treated in this section is the relation of the magnetic potential to the normal\nmagnetic flux densities. First the electroquasistatic fields are considered, and then the magnetoquasi-\nstatic relations follow by analogy.\nElectric Fields:\nIf any one of the regions shown in Tables 2.16.1-3 is filled with insulating\ncharge-free (pf\nO) material of uniform permittivity e,\nS(-\n)E,\nD =\nE\n(1)\nthe governing field equations are Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a,\nV*D = 0\n(2)\nand the condition that E be irrotational, Eq. 2.3.24a. The latter is equivalent to\nE = -V0\n(3)\nThus, the potential distribution within a volume is described by Laplace's equation\nV20 = 0\n(4)\nIn terms of 4,\nD = -eVO\n(5)\nMagnetic Fields:\nFor magnetoquasistatic fields in an insulating region (Jf = 0) of uniform per-\nmeability\nM= (I-- 1)Hi;.B =pH\n(6)\nThus, from Ampere's law, Eq. 2.3.23b, H is irrotational and it is appropriate to define a magnetic\npotential Y:\nH = -V_\n(7)\nIn addition. there is Eq. 2.3.24b:\nV.B = 0\n(8)\nThus, the potential again satisfies Laplace's equation\nv2y = 0\n(9)\nand in terms of ', the magnetic flux density is\nB = -1VW\n(10)\nComparison of the last two relations to Eqs. 4 and 5 shows that relations now derived for the\nelectric fields can be carried over to describe the magnetic fields by making the identification\nPlanar Layer:\nBounding surfaces at x = A and x = 0, respectively denoted by a and 0, are shown\nin Table 2.16.1. So far as developments in this section are concerned, these are not physical boundaries\nThey are simply surfaces at which the potentials are respectively\n4(A,y,z,t) = Re g\n(t)exp[-j(k y+k z)]; D(0,y,z,t) = Re I 0(t)exp[-j(k y+kzz)]\n(11)\nt\ny( zy\ny\nSecs. 2.15 & 2.16\n2.32\n\nTable 2.16.1.

To obtain magnetic relations,\nsubstitute (Q,Dx,) +e ('Y,.B,).\nThese will be recognized as generalizations of the complex amplitudes introduced with Eq. 2.15.1. That\nthe potentials at the a and $ surfaces can be quite general follows from the discussion of Sec. 2.15,\nwhich shows that the following arguments apply when I is a spatial Fourier amplitude or a Fourier trans-\nform.\nIn view of the surface potential distributions, solutions to Eq. 4 are assumed to take the form\nS=-\nRe O(x,t) exp[-j(kyy + kzz)]\n(12)\nSubstitution shows that\nd2\n2 = 0; y =Vk2 + k2\n(13)\ny\nz\ndx\n+yx\nSolutions of this equation are linear combinations of e\nor alternatively of sinh yx and cosh yx.\nWith ~i and 12 arbitrary functions of time, the solution teakes the form\n$1\n0 sinh yx + 02 cosh yx\n(14)\nThe two coefficients are determined by requiring that the conditions of Eq. 11 be satisfied. For the sim-\nple situation at hand, an instructive alternative to performing the algebra necessary to evaluate (01,02)\nconsists in recognizing that a linear combination of the two solutions in Eq. 14 is sinh y(x - A).\nThus,\nthe solution can be written as the sum of solutions that are individually zero on one or the other of the\nbounding surfaces. By inspection, it follows that\na- sinh.yx _ .; sinh y(x - A)\n(15)\nsinh yA\nsinh yA\nFrom Eqs. 5 and 15,\ncan be determined:\n-e ax\nRe\nRy a cosh\n-B\ncosh y(x-A)\n-\nx\nsinh yx\nyA\nsinh yA\n(ky + kz)\n(16)\nEvaluation of this equation at x -\nA gives the displacement vector normal to the a surface, with complex\namplitude ED. Similarly, evaluated at x = 0, Eq. 16\nives D5. The components of the \"flux\" (Nij ) are\nnow determined, given the respective potentials (ci ,B).\nThe transfer relations, Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1,\nsummarize what is found. These relations can be solved for any pair of variables as a function of the\nremaining pair. The inverse transfer relations are also summarized for reference in Table 2.16.1, Eq.

Analogously, the (D,,Dx)\nch have units of charge per unit area and an arbitrary time dependence) are given as linear func-\ns of the potentials by Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1. A similar analogy exists between Eq. 2.12.5,\nessing (X1 ,X2 ) as functions of (il,i 2), and the transfer relations between (B ,BO) (units of flux\nunit area) and the magnetic potentials (TYa,P).\nAccording to Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1, Dx is induced by a \"self term\" (proportional to the potential\nhe same surface) and a \"mutual term.\"\nThe coefficients which express this self- and mutual-coupling\na dependence on ay (2r/y the wavelength in the y-z plane) shown in Fig. 2.16.1a. Written in the\nof Eq. 15, the potential has components, excited at each surface, that decay to zero, as shown in\n2.16.1b, at a rate that is proportional to how rapidly the fields vary in the y-z plane. For long\ns the decay is relatively slow, as depicted by the case Ay = 0.5, and the mutual-field is almost as\nt as the self field. But as the wavelength is shortened relative to A (Ay increased), the surfaces\nle less and less.\nIn this discussion it is assumed that y is real, which it is if ky and kz are real.\nIn fact, the\nsfer relations are valid and useful for complex values of (ky,kz).\nIf these numbers are purely\ninary, the field distributions over the layer cross section are periodic. Such solutions are needed\natisfy boundary conditions imposed in an x-y plane.\nCylindrical Annulus: With the bounding surfaces coaxial cylinders having radii a and B, it is\nral to use cylindrical coordinates (r, 0, z).\nA cross section of this prototype region and the\ndinates are shown in Table 2.16.2.\nOn the outer and inner surfaces, the potential has the respec\nforms\no(a,e,z,t) = Re P (t) e-\ne\nj(m +kz);\n0(B,0,z,t) = Re ~ (t)e-j(me+kz)\n(17)\ne, it is appropriate to assume a bulk potential\n( = Re y(r,t)e -j(me+kz)\n(18)\nstitution in Laplace's equation (see Appendix A for operations in cylindrical coordinates), Eq. 4,\nn shows that\nd\n1 d@\nm\n(19)\n-\n-)\n-\n(k\n+\n(19)\ndr 2 + r dr\ndr\nr\nontrast with Eq. 13, this one has space-varying coefficients.\nIt is convenient to categorize the\ntions according to the values of (m,k).

The resulting transfer relations are summarized by\nEq. (a) in Table 2.16.2. Inversion of these relations, to give the surface potentials as functions of\nthe surface displacements, results in the relations summarized by Eq. (b) of that table. Primes denote\nderivatives with respect to the entire specified argument of the function.

They do not require infinite series for their representation.\nTo the second order differential equation, Eq. 33, there must be a second set of solutions Q.\nBecause these are singular in the interval 0 4 e < 7 , and situations of interest here include the\nentire spherical surface at any given radius, these solutions are not included. The functions Pm play\nthe role of exp(jkz)(say) in cylindrical geometry, while exp(jmo) is analogous to exp(jmO).\nThe radial\ndependence, which is much of the bother in cylindrical coordinates, is actually quite simple in spherica\ncoordinates. From Eq. 31b it is seen that solutions are a linear combination of rn and r-(n+l).

(a) and (b) is now carried out\nfollowing the same procedure as for the planar layer. From these relations follow the limiting situ-\nations of a solid spherical region or one where the outer surface is well removed from the region of\ninterest summarized for reference by Eqs.

Because there is no volume free current density,\nH = -VT\nand Eq. 2.14.9 becomes\n6w = -\nd'B'nda\n(3)\nS\nConsider now the implications of these last two expressions for the transfer relations derived in\nSec. 2.16. Discussion is in terms of the electrical relations, but the analogy made in Sec. 2.16 clearl\npertains as well to Eqs. 2 and 3, so that the arguments also apply to the magnetic transfer relations.\nSuppose that the increment of energy 6w is introduced through S to a volume bounded by sections o\nthe a and B surfaces extending one \"wavelength\" in the surface dimensions. In Cartesian coordinates,\n5. F. B. Hildebrand, loc. cit., pp. 159-165.\nSecs. 2.16 & 2.17\n2.40\nl\nf\n\nthis volume is bounded by (y,z) surfaces extending one wavelength in the y and z directions. In cylin-\ndrical coordinates, the volume is a pie-shaped cylinder subtended by outside and inside surfaces having\nlength 2w/k in the z direction and 2wa/m and 2rB/m respectively in the azimuthal direction. In spherical\ncoordinates, the volume is a sector from a sphere with 0 = 2w/m radians along the equator, 6 extending\nfrom 0 + w and the surfaces at r = a and r = 8.\nIn any of these cases, conservation of energy, as\nexpressed by Eq. 2, requires that\n6w = -aa KKa6D\n+ a\n0B6D8\n(4)\nThe ( )> indicate averages over the respective surfaces of excitation.

Not only does this reduce the vector field to a scalar field, but the potential function\nevaluated on such surfaces as those of \"perfectly\" conducting electrodes becomes a lumped parameter\nterminal variable, e.g., the voltage.\nSolenoidal fields, such as the magnetic flux density B, are for similar reasons sometimes re-\npresented in terms of a vector potential A:\n+\n+\nThus, B automatically has no divergence. Unfortunately, the vector field B is represented in terms of\nanother vectox field A. However, for important two-dimensional or symmetric configurations, a single\ncomponent of A is all required to again reduce the description to one involving a scalar function.\nFour commonly encountered cases are summarized in-Table 2.18.1.\nThe first two are two-dimensional in the usual sense. The field B lies in the x-y (or r-8) plane\nand depends only on these coordinates. The associated vector potential has only a z component. The\nthird configuration, l1ke the second, is in cylindrical geometry, but with B independent of e and hence\nwith A having only an i0 component. The fourth configuration is in spherical geometry with symmetry\nabout the z axis and the vector potential directed along 0..\nLike the scalar potential used to represent irrotational fields, the vector potential is closely\nrelated to lumped parameter variables. If B is the magnetic flux density, i4 is convenient for evalua-\ntion of tje flux linkage X (Eq. 2.12.1).\nFor an incompressible flow, where B is replaced by the fluid\nvelocity v, the vector potential is conveniently used to evaluate the volume rate of flow. In that\napplication, A and A become \"stream functions.\"\nThe connection between the flux linked and the vector potential follows from Stokes's theorem,\nEq. 2.6.3. The flux 1X through a surface S enclosed by a contour C is\n0= f 1da\na =\nV x -tnda\n=\n1d-\n(2)\nS\nS\nC\nIn each of the configurations of Table 2.18.1, Eq. 2 amounts to an evaluation of the surface integral.\nFor example, in the Cartesian two-dimensional configuration, contributions to the integration around a\ncontour C enclosing a surface having length 2 in the z direction, only come from the legs running in\nthe a direction. Along these portions of the contour, denoted by (a) and (b), the coordinates (x,y) are\nconstant. Hence, the flux through the surface is simply 2 times the difference A(a) - A(b), as sum-\nmarized in Table 2.18.1.\nIn the axisymmetric cylindrical and spherical configurations, r and r sin 6 dependences are\nrespectively introduced, so that evaluation of A essentially gives the flux linked. For example, in\nthe spherical configuration, the flux linked by a surface having inner and outer radii r cos 0 evaluated\nat (a) and (b) is simply\nSA(,r\nsin e\n.d=\nr sin e 2(r\nsin e)b = 2rI[A(a) -\nA(b)]\n(3)\nC\nUsed in fluid mechanics to represent incompressible fluid flow, A is the Stokel's stream function. Note\nthat the flux is positive if directed through the surface in the direction of n, which is specified in\nterms of the contour C by the right-hand rule.\n2.19 Vector Potential Transfer Relations for Certain Laplacian Fields\nEven in dealing with magnetic fields in regions where Jf = 0, if the flux linkages are of interest,\nit is often more convenient to develop a model in terms of transfer relations specified in terms of a\nvector rather than scalar potential. The objective in this section is to summarize these relations for\nthe first three configurations identified in Table 2.18.1.\nSecs. 2.17, 2.18 & 2.19\n2.42\n\n(j)\n(-\n(k)\n(1)\nA.\npotential\nspherical\nie\nA\nr\nvector\nlA\nD8\nA(b)]\nr\n-\nof\nAxisymmetric\nsin\n[\ncomponents\nsin\nr\nr\n27[A(a)\n=\nB\n4y\nsingle\n(g)\nh\nz\nAA\nr\nby\ncylindrical\n(i)\n1 rr\nA(b)]\nrepresented\nr\n-\nAxisymmetric\nA\nrz\n1 r rraz\n2r[A(a)\nB\n=\n=\n-\nfield\nA\n+ B\nI\nsolenoidal\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nie\nA\nA\n-r\nA(b)]\nhaving\nPolar\nz\nr\n-\nA(r,O)i\naA+ i\na\nB\n£[A(a)\nconfigurations\nra-\nS=\nA=\n+\nImportant\n(a)\nCartesian\n(b)\n(c)\nA(b)]\n2.18.1.\ni\nTable\nTwo-dimensional\ny\nBA\nax\nz\n-\ntt\nA(x,y)i\n-A\nx\ni\nBA\ny\n£[A(a)\n@\n-4\n=\n=\n=\n=\nA\nB\n\n(e1\n(e)\n(f)\nz\nAr\n1L\n2.16.2,\ncylindrical\nHz\nz\n=\na\nTable\nfields.\nA\n) )\nz\n(a,)\nr\nAxisymmetric\nfZ\n.-.\nH\nI\nGo(c,~\no(\nsee\nLaplacian\nF\n-o\ngo\nk\nA\nA(r)exp(-jkz);\n(~c)\nF\nG(~)\nfo(,i)\nfo\nJ[J\nG\n)L\n,\na\nsymmetric\nRe\nk2\n-\n(kA\nG\n-()\nFo,\nk\n(\ni,\n0,\nA=\n=\n=\nz\nFor\nm\nH\n[(a,\nor\ntwo-dimensional\n(c)\n(d)\nI1\n2.16.2,\nJ3\nTable\nfor\nPolar\nexp(-jmA)\nc)\na,\na,1)\nr B[\nrelations\n(\nm(a,)\n(,\nM6\nm\ngm\nfsinh(k)\nf\nGm-(I,)\nsee\n)\nGm\n1 m\n(\n(B,a)\n(,a)\nFm,\nA(r)\nm\nm\nM\n[J\nA\ntransfer\nF\ngm,\nSr1\n#\nRe\np\nm\n=\niz\nJ\nfm,\n0,\npotential\nA=\nL\nFor\n=\nk\nI\nI/\nS(b)\nVector\nCartesian\nk(a)\ny\nY\nA\nHy\n2.19.1.\nJL\nsinh(kA)\nTable\nTwo-dimensional\ncoth(kA)\nsinh(kA)\nexp(-jky)\nkB\nIIx\nA(x)\n-coth(kAA)\nLsinh(kA)\n-1\nsh\nsinh(kA)\nLB\nRe\n[\n-coth(kA)\nk\nS\nz\n=\ni\nL\n=\ny\nA\nI\n\n+\nWith B represented in terms of A by Eq. 2.18.1, Ampere's law (Eq. 2.3.23) requires that in a region\nuniform permeability p,\nV x V x A = 1Jf\n(1)\nS+\n+\nr a given magnetic flux density B, cull A is specified.

By\nappropriate identification of variables, the same relations can be used to describe different regions.\nAs an example, three planar regions are shown in\nFig. 2.20.1. The symbols in parentheses denote positions\nadjacent to the surfaces demarking subregions. At the\nsurfaces, variables can be discontinuous. Hence it is\nnecessary to distinguish variables evaluated on adjacent\nsides of a boundary. The transfer relations describe\nthe fields within the subregions and not across the\nboundaries.\nThe transfer relations of Table 2.16.1 can be\napplied to the upper region by identifying (a) + (d),\n(0) + (e), A + a and s or P -\nEa or Pa.

Once the surface variables have\nbeen self-consistently determined, the field distributions within the region can be evaluated using the\nbulk distributions evaluated in terms of the surface coefficients. With appropriate surface amplitudes\nand x + x', where the latter is defined for each region in Fig. 2.20.1, Eq. 2.16.15 describes the\npotential distribution.\nThis approach will be used not only in other geometries but in representing mechanical and\nelectromechanical processes.\nSec. 2.20\n2.46\n\nProblems for Chapter 2\nFor Section 2.3:\nProb. 2.3.1\nPerfectly conducting plane parallel plates are shorted at z = 0 and driven by a distributed\ncurrent source at z = -Z, as shown in Fig. P2.3.1.\ni(t)\nFig. P2.3.1\n(a) Apply the normalization of Eq. 4b to Maxwell's equations used to represent the fields between the\nplates.

Rationalized MKS units are used not only\nin connection with electrodynamics, but also in dealing with subjects such as fluid mechanics and heat\ntransfer, which are often treated in English units. Unless otherwise given, basic units of meters (m),\nkilograms (kg), seconds (sec), and Coulombs (C) can be assumed.\nTable 2.1.1.\nSummary of electrodynamic nomenclature.\nName\nSymbol\nUnits\nDiscrete Variables\nVoltage or potential difference\nv\n[V] = volts = m2 kg/C sec2\nCharge\nq\n[C] = Coulombs = C\nCurrent\ni\n[A] = Amperes = C/sec\nMagnetic flux\nX\n[Wb] = Weber = m2 kg/C sec\nCapacitance\nC\n[F] = Farad C2 sec 2 /m2 kg\nInductance\nL\n[H] = Henry = m2 kg/C2\nForce\nf\n[N] = Newtons = kg m/sec2\nField Sources\nFree charge density\nPf\nC/m3\nFree surface charge density\n-f\nC/m2\nFree current density\n4f\nA/m2\nFree surface current density\nKf\nA/m\nFields (name in quotes is often used for convenience)\n\"Electric field\" intensity\nV/m\n\"Magnetic field\" intensity\nA/m\nElectric displacement\nC/m2\nMagnetic flux density\nWb/m 2 (tesla)\nPolarization density\nC/m2\nMagnetization density\nM\nA/m\nForce density\nF\nN/m3\nPhysical Constants\nPermittivity of free space\n6o = 8.854 x 1012\nF/m\nPermeability of free space\n1o = 4r x 10- 7\nH/m\nAlthough terms involving moving magnetized and polarized media may not be familiar, Maxwell's\nequations are summarized without prelude in the next section. The physical significance of the un-\nfamiliar terms can best be discussed in Secs. 2.8 and 2.9 after the general laws are reduced to their\nquasistatic forms, and this is the objective of Sec. 2.3.\nExcept for introducing concepts concerned\nwith the description of continua, including integral theorems, in Secs. 2.4 and 2.6, and the dis-\ncussion of Fourier amplitudes in Sec. 2.15, the remainder of the chapter is a parallel development of\nthe consequences of these quasistatic laws. That the field transformations (Sec. 2.5), integral laws\n(Sec. 2.7), splicing conditions (Sec. 2.10), and energy storages are derived from the fundamental quasi-\nstatic laws, illustrates the important dictum that internal consistency be maintained within the frame-\nwork of the quasistatic approximation.\nThe results of the sections on energy storage are used in Chap. 3 for deducing the electric and\nmagnetic force densities on macroscopic media. The transfer relations of the last sections are an\nimportant resource throughout all of the following chapters, and give the opportunity to explore the\nphysical significance of the quasistatic limits.\n2.2 Differential Laws of Electrodynamics\nIn the Chu formulation,l with material effects on the fields accounted for by the magnetization\ndensity M and the polarization density P and with the material velocity denoted by v, the laws of\nelectrodynamics are:\nFaraday's law\n4+\n3H\nP--\nat\no\nM\n+\n(\no\nSt\no\nBt\n1.

In this formulation the electric displacement\nand magnetic flux\ndensity B are defined fields:\nD =\nE + P\n(6)\no\n4-\n-\nB =\no(H + M)\n(7)\n2.3\nQuasistatic Laws and the Time-Rate Expansion\nWith a quasistatic model, it is recognized that relevant time rates of change are sufficiently\nlow that contributions due to a particular dynamical process are ignorable. The objective in this\nsection is to give some formal structure to the reasoning used to deduce the quasistatic field equa-\ntions from the more general Maxwell's equations. Here, quasistatics specifically means that times\nof interest are long compared to the time, Tem, for an electromagnetic wave to propagate through the\nsystem.\nGenerally, given a dynamical process characterized by some time determined by the parameters of\nthe system, a quasistatic model can be used to exploit the comparatively long time scale for proc-\nesses of interest. In this broad sense, quasistatic models abound and will be encountered in many\nother contexts in the chapters that follow. Specific examples are:\n(a) processes slow compared to wave transit times in general; acoustic waves and the model is\none of incompressible flow, Alfvyn and other electromechanical waves and the model is less standard;\n(b) processes slow compared to diffusion (instantaneous diffusion models). What diffuses can\nbe magnetic field, viscous stresses, heat, molecules or hybrid electromechanical effects;\n(c) processes slow compared to relaxation of continua (instantaneous relaxation or constant-\npotential models). Charge relaxation is an important example.\nThe point of making a quasistatic approximation is often to focus attention on significant\ndynamical processes. A quasistatic model is by no means static.\nBecause more than one rate process\nis often imbedded in a given physical system, it is important to agree upon the one with respect to\nwhich the dynamics are quasistatic.\nRate processes other than those due to the transit time of electromagnetic waves enter through\nthe dependence of the field sources on the fields and material motion. To have in view the additional\ncharacteristic times typically brought in by the field sources, in this section the free current\ndensity is postulated to have the dependence\nJf = G(r)E + Jv(v,pf,H)\n(i)\nIn the absence of motion, Jv is zero. Thus, for media at rest the conduction model is ohmic, with the\nel-ctrical conductivity a in general a funqtion Qf position. Examples of Jv are a convection current\npfv, or an ohmic motion-induced current a(v x\n0oH).\nWith an underbar used to denote a normalized\nquantity, the conductivity is normalized to a typical (constant) conductivity a :\na =\n(r,t)\n(2)\no-\nTo identify the hierarchy of critical time-rate parameters, the general laws are normalized.\nCoordinates are normalized to one typical length X, while T represents a characteristic dynamical time:\n(x,y,z) = (Zx,kY,kz);\nt = Tt\n(3)\nSecs. 2.2 & 2.3\n\nIn a system sinusoidally excited at the angular frequency\n, T= W-1l\nIn a system sinusoidally excited at the angular frequency w, T=w\nThe most convenient normalization of the fields depends on the specific system. Where electro-\nmechanical coupling is significant, these can usually be categorized as \"electric-field dominated\" and\n\"magnetic-field dominated.\"\nAnticipating this fact, two normalizations are now developed \"in parallel,\"\nthe first taking e as a characteristic electric field and the second taking _ as.a characteristic mag-\nnetic field:\no\nv\nT -v\np E\nf\nH\n+\npf =- 9 , H=-\n-H,MM T-\nH = H,\nM v = (/),\n=\nJ\n=\nLf\n-v\nE=\nP Pf\np-,. P=f\n,\n-\nP\nIt might be appropriate with this step to recognize that the material motion introduces a characteristic\n(transport) time other than T. For simplicity, Eq. 4 takes the material velocity as being of the order\nof R/T.\nThe normalization used is arbitrary. The same quasistatic laws will be deduced regardless of the\nstarting point, but the normalization will determine whether these laws are \"zero-order\" or higher order\nin a sense to now be defined.\nThe normalizations of Eq. 4 introduced into Eqs. 2.2.1-5 result in\nV.1 = -V.y + pf\nV.H = -V-M\n+T\n+.\n+\nE\n9P\n(\nx)\nVxH = -\naE\n+ J +\n+ -- +Vx (P xv)\nT\nv\n+t ~t\ne\nH+ 3\nx\nV\n~-V]\nVxE = -s\nt\nt + Vx (x\nSe F\n~f\nV.\nE + -\nV*J\nt+ ]\ne\nv\n't J\nV.E = -V.p +\nV.H = -V.M\nTm\nVxH = --\nE\nT\nS\nH\nVxE\n=\nat\n+ J + O\n+\nV x (Mx v)\n-y\nT\nDp\nV.

The time required for an electromagnetic plane wave to propa-\ngate the distance k at the velocity c is Tem. Given that there is just one characteristic length,\nthere are actually only two characteristic times, because as can be seen from Eq. 10\n(11)\nTme\nem\nUnless Te and Tm, and hence Tem, are all of the same order, there are only two possibilities for the\nrelative magnitudes of these times, as summarized in Fig. 2.3.1.\n18W(I\nI\nIr\nTm\n-\nelectroquasistati cs\nTCe\nmem\nmagnetoquasistatics\nFig. 2.3.1.

Note that T is still arbitrary relative to Te.\nIn the magnetoquasistatic (MQS) approximation, 0 is still small, but the ordering of characteristic times\nis as to the right. In this case, T is arbitrary relative to Tm.\nTo make a formal statement of the procedure used to find the quasistatic approximation, the normal-\nized fields and charge density are expanded in powers of the time-rate parameter 0.\nE = E + E1 +\nE2 +\n0o\n+\nH01\n+\n+2\n(12)\niv -\n( v)o + 0v)\n+0 ( )2 +\nPf = (Pf)o +\n(Pf) 1 +\n()2 +\nIn the following, it is assumed that constitutive laws relate P and M to E and H, so that these\ndensities are similarly expanded. The velocity 4 is taken as given. Then, the series are sub-\nstituted into Eqs. 5-9 and the resulting expressions arranged by factors multiplying ascending\npowers of 0. The \"zero order\" equations are obtained by requiring that the coefficients of 8\nvanish. These are simply Eqs. 5-9 with B = 0:\nV.- o = -V.-P\n+ (pf) o\nVxHo =\n-\no0\ne\napo\n+ ---\n+\n÷\nat\n(Jv)o + --\nVx (o x V)\n4.\nVxE\no\n+\ne\n- (v\n= 0\nV.oE +T-\no +\nat\nV.E = -V.o + (P)o\nv-H -V-M\nT\nVxH\n--\na E\n+ (J )\naH\naM\nVxE\no\nVx(M\nx V)\no\nat\nat\nV.o E +_V.)\n=0\nEo\nT\nV)o\nm\nThe zero-order solutions are found by solving these equations, augmented by appropriate\nboundary conditions.

Thus higher order fields satisfy homo-\ngeneous boundary conditions.\nOnce the first order solutions are known, the process can be repeated with these forming the\n\"drives\" for the n=2 equations.\nIn the absence of loss effects, there are no characteristic times to distinguish MQS and EQS\nsystems. In that limit, which set of normalizations is used is a matter of convenience. If a situa-\ntion represented by the left-hand set actually has an EQS limit, the zero order laws become the quasi-\nstatic laws.\nBut, if these expressions are applied to a situation that is actually MQS, then first-\norder terms must be calculated to find the quasistatic fields. If more than the one characteristic\ntime Tern is involved, as is the case with finite Te and Tm, then the ordering of rate parameters can\ncontribute to the convergence of the expansion.\nIn practice, a formal derivation of the quasistatic laws is seldom used. Rather, intuition and\nexperience along with comparison of critical time constants to relevant dynamical times is used to\nidentify one of the two sets of zero order expressions as appropriate. But, the use of normalizations\nto identify critical parameters, and the notion that characteristic times can be used to unscramble\ndynamical processes, will be used extensively in the chapters to follow.\nWithin the framework of quasistatic electrodynamics, the unnormalized forms of Eqs. 13-17\nconmrise the \"exact\" field laws\nThese enuations are reordered to reflect their relative imnortance:\nElectroquasistatic (EQS)\nV.-E E= -V'P + Pf\nVx = 0\nS\napf\nV.Jf + -y-= 0\nVxH =\n+\n+2--\n+ Vx (P x v)\nf\nt\nat\nViiH = -V PoM\nMagnetoquasistatic (MQS)\nVx\n= f\n(23)\nV.1oH = -V.o M\n(24)\na4,.\nall\nH\nVxE\nat\nat\n-oV\nx (M x v) (25)\nV-J\n= o\n(26)\nVeoE = -VP + Pf\n(27)\nThe conduction current Jf has been reintroduced to reflect the wider range of validity of these\nequations than might be inferred from Eq. 1. With different conduction models will come different\ncharacteristic times,exemplified in the discussions of this section by Te and Tm . Matters are more\ncomplicated if fields and media interact electromechanically. Then, v is determined to some extent\nat least by the fields themselves and must be treated on a par with the field variables. The result\ncan be still more characteristic times.\nThe ordering of the quasistatic equations emphasizes the instantaneous relation between the\nrespective dominant sources and fields. Given the charge and polarization densities in the EQS system,\nor given the current and magnetization densities in the MQS system, the dominant fields are known and\nare functions only of the sources at the given instant in time.\nThe dynamics enter in the EQS system with conservation of charge, and in the MQS system with\nFaraday'l law of induction. Equations 26a and 27a are only needed 4f an after-the-fact determina-\ntion of H is to be made. An example where such a rare interest in H exists is in the small mag-\nnetic field induced by electric fields and currents within the human body. The distribution of in-\nternal fields and hence currents is determined by the first three EQS equations. Given 1, -, and\nJf, the remaining two expressions determine H. In the MQS system, Eq. 27b can be regarded as an\nexpression for the after-the-fact evaluation of pf, which is not usually of interest in such systems.\nWhat makes the subject of quasistatics difficult to treat in a general way,even for a system\nof fixed ohmic conductivity, is the dependence of the appropriate model on considerations not con-\nveniently represented in the differential laws. For example, a pair of perfectly conducting plates,\nshorted on one pair of edges and driven by a sinusoidal source at the opposite pair, will be MQS\nat low frequencies. The same pair of plates, open-circuited rather than shorted, will be electroquasi-\nstatic at low frequencies. The difference is in the boundary conditions.\nGeometry and the inhomogeneity of the medium (insulators, perfect conductors and semiconductors)\nare also essential to determining the appropriate approximation. Most systems require more than one\nSec. 2.3\n\ncharacteristic dimension and perhaps conductivity for their description, with the result that more than\ntwo time constants are often involved. Thus, the two possibilities identified in Fig. 2.3.1 can in\nprinciple become many possibilities. Even so, for a wide range of practical problems, the appropriate\nfield laws are either clearly electroquasistatic or magnetoquasistatic.\nProblems accompanying this section help to make the significance of the quasistatic limits more\nsubstantive by considering cases that can also be solved exactly.\n2.4 Continuum Coordinates and the Convective Derivative\nThere are two commonly used representations of continuum variables.\nOne of these is familiar\nfrom classical mechanics, while the other is universally used in electrodynamics. Because electro-\nmechanics involves both of these subjects, attention is now drawn to the salient features of the two\nrepresentations.\nConsider first the \"Lagrangian representation.\"\nThe position of a material particle is a natural\nexample and is depicted by Fig. 2.4.1a. When the time t is zero, a particle is found at the position\nro .\nThe position of the particle at some subsequent time is t. To let t represent the displacement of\na continuum of particles, the position variable ro is used to distinguish particles.\nIn this sense, the\ndisplacement y then also becomes a continuum variable capable of representing the relative displace-\nments of an infinitude of particles.\nu)\nkU)\nFig. 2.4.1.\nParticle motions represented in terms of (a) Lagrangian coordinates,\nwhere the initial particle coordinate ro designates the particle of\ninterest, and (b) Eulerian coordinates, where (x,y,z) designates the\nspatial position of interest.\nIn a Lagrangian representation, the velocity of the particle is simply\nat\nIf concern is with only one particle, there is no point in writing the derivative as a partial deriv-\native. However, it is understood that, when the derivgtive is taken, it is a particular particle\nwhich is being considered. So, it is understood that ro is fixed. Using the same line of reasoning,\nthe acceleration of a particle is given by\na at\nThe idea of representing continuum variables in terms of the coordinates (x,y,z) connected with\nthe space itself is familiar from electromagnetic theory. But what does it mean if the variable is\nmechanical rather than electrical? We could represent the velocit- of the continuum of particles\nfilling the space of interest by a vector function v(x,y,z,t) = v(r,t).\nThe velocity of particles\nhaving the position (x,y,z,) at a given time t is determined by evaluating the function v(r,t).\nThe\nvelocity appearing in Sec. 2.2 is an example. As suggested by Fig. 2.4.1b, if the function is the\nvelocity evaluated at a given position in space, it describes whichever particle is at that point at\nthe time of interest. Generally, there is a continuous stream of particles through the point (x,y,z).\nSecs. 2.3 & 2.4\n~\n)\n\nComputation of the particle acceleration makes evident the contrast between Eulerian and Lagrangian\nrepresentations. By definition, the acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity computed for a\ngiven particle of matter. A particle having the position (x,y,z) at time t will be found an instant\nAt later at the position (x + vxAt,y + vyAt,z + vzAt).\nHence the acceleration is\nv(x + v At,y + v At,z + v At,t + At) - v(x,y,z,t)\na=lim\nx\ny\nz\n(3)\nAt÷OAt\nExpansion of tje first term in Eq. 3 about the initial coordinates of the particle gives the convective\nderivative of v:\n+\nv\nav\nav\nav _\nv\n+\n+\na\n+ v\n+ v\n+ v\n+ v*Vv\n(4)\nt\nx ax\ny\ny\nz\n(4)at\nThe difference between Eq. 2 and Eq. 4 is resolved by recognizing the difference in the signi-\nficance of the partial derivatives. In Eq. 2, it is understood that the coordinates being held fixed\nare the initial coordinates of the particle of interest. In Eq. 4, the partial derivative is taken,\nholding fixed the particular point of interest in space.\nThe same steps .show that the rate of change of any vector variable A, as viewed from a particle\nhaving the velocity v, is\nDAaA 31\n+\n(\nS-\n+ (V);\nA = A(x,y,z,t)\n(5)\nThe time rate of change of any scalar variable for an observer moving with the velocity v is obtained\nfrom Eq. 5 by considering the particular case in which t has only one component, say 1 = f(x,y,z,t)Ax.\nThen Eq. 5 becomes\nDf\nf\n+f\nf- E - -+\nv.Vf\n(6)\nReference 3 of Appendix C is a film useful in understanding this section.\n2.5 Transformations between Inertial Frames\nIn extending empirically determined conduction, polarization and magnetization laws to include\nmaterial motion, it is often necessary to relate field variables evaluated in different reference\nframes. A given point in space can be designated either in terms of the coordinate 1 or of the co-\nordinate V' of Fig. 2.5.1. By \"inertial reference frames,\" it is meant that the relative velocity\nbetween these two frames is constant, designated by '. The positions in the two coordinate systems\nare related by the Galilean transformation:\nr'\n= r -\nut;\nt'\n= t\n(1)\nFig. 2.5.1\nReference frames have constant\nrelative velocity t. The co-\nordinates t = (x,y,z) and 1' =\n(x',y',z') designate the same\nposition.\nIt is a familiar fact that variables describing a given physical situation in one reference frame\nwill not be the same as those in the other. An example is material velocity, which, if measured in one\nframe, will differ from that in the other frame by the relative velocity ~.\nThere are two objectives in this section: one is to show that the quasistatic laws are invariant\nwhen subject to a Galilean transformation between inertial reference frames. But, of more use is the\nrelationship between electromagnetic variables in the two frames of reference that follows from this\nSecs. 2.4 & 2.5\n\nproof.\nThe\napproach\nis\nas\nfollows.\nFirst,\nthe\npostulate\nis\nmade\nthat\nthe\nquasistatic\nequations\ntake\nthe\nsame\nform\nin\nthe\nprimed\nand\nunprimed\ninertial\nreference\nframes.\nBut,\nin\nwriting\nthe\nlaws\nin\nthe\nprimed\nframe,\nthe\nspatial\nand\ntemporal\nderivatives\nmust\nbe\ntaken\nwith\nrespect\nto\nthe\ncoordinates\nof\nthat\nref-\nerence\nframe,\nand\nthe\ndependent\nfield\nvariables\nare\nthen\nfields\ndefined\nin\nthat\nreference\nframe.\nIn\ngeneral,\nthese\nmust\nbe\ndesignated\nby\nprimes,\nsince\ntheir\nrelation\nto\nthe\nvariables\nin\nthe\nunprimed\nframe\nis\nnot\nknown.\nFor\nthe\npurpose\nof\nwriting\nthe\nprimed\nequations\nof\nelectrodynamics\nin\nterms\nof\nthe\nun\nrimed\nco-\nFor\nthe nurnose o writina the nrimd enuations of elctrod-ax cs in tems of the u- rime\nordinates, recognize that\nV' + V\nA\na\n)+\n-\n= al\"\na-)+\n(-\n+ u*V)A\n-\n+ uV*A - Vx (uxA)\n+\n(+ uV9\n+Vu\n( t +\nE at\nThe left relations follow by using the chain rule of differentiation and the transformation of Eq. 1.\nThat the spatial derivatives taken with respect to one frame must be the same as those with respect\nto the other frame physically means that a single \"snapshot\" of the physical process would be all\nrequired to evaluate the spatial derivatives in either frame. There would be no way of telling which\nframe was the one from which the snapshot was taken. By contrast, the time rate of change for an\nobserver in the primed frame is, by definition, taken with the primed spatial coordinates held fixed.\nIn terms of the fixed frame coordinates, this is the convective derivative defined with Eqs. 2.4.5\nand 2.4.6. However, v in these equations is in general a function of space and time. In the context\nof this section it is saecialized to the constant u. Thus, in rewriting the convective derivatives of\nEq. 2 the constancy of u and a vector identity (Eq. 16, Appendix B) have been used.\nSo far, what has been said in this section is a matter of coordinates. Now, a physically motivated\npostulate is made concerning the electromagnetic laws. Imagine one electromagnetic experiment that is\nto be described from the two different reference frames. The postulate is that provided each of these\nframes is inertial, the governing laws must take the same form. Thus, Eqs. 23-27 apply with [V - V',\nc()/at - a()/at'] and all dependent variables primed. By way of comparing these laws to those ex-\npressed in the fixed-frame, Eqs. 2 are used to rewrite these expressions in terms of the unprimed in-\ndependent variables. Also, the moving-frame material velocity is rewritten in terms of the unprimed\nframe velocity using the relation\nv'\nv-\nu\nThus, the laws originally expressed in the primed frame of reference become\nV.e E'\nE\n-V.P'\n+ p\nf\nV x E' = 0\nV.(ij + up!) + -\nV x (' + ux C ') -\n(\n+ up )\naE$'\n+\n'\nx,\n+\n+\n+ V x (P x\nat\nat\nV~o\noM0\nV x i' =\nV*oH'\n-V.o0 M'\nVx('\n-\nu x ~i')\nal H0'\nat\nay M'\n-\n(6)\nat\n-\nV x (' x V)\n-\nf\nV~eo'\n=\nV.P'+\n!\nIn writing Eq. 7a, Eq. 4a is used. Similarly, Eq. 5b is used to write Eq. 6b. For the one experi-\nment under consideration, these equations will.predict the same behavior as the fixed frame laws,\nEqs. 2.3.23-27, if the identification is made:\nSec.\n2.5\n\nE- ,\nPE'= P\n4.\n+\nS= J\n-Upf\nH' .'A-i x eE\no\nand hence, from Eq. 2.2.6\nD' =D\nMQS\n'-\nA\n(9)\n4.\n+\nM' = M\n(10)\nJ\n= Jf\n(11)\nE'= E + ux poH\n(12)\n(13)\nand hence, from Eq. 2.2.7\nB' = B\n(14)\nThe primary fields are the same whether viewed from one frame or the other. Thus, the EQS elec-\ntric field polarization density and charge density are the same in both frames, as are the MQS mag-\nnetic field, magnetization density and current density. The respective dynamic laws can be associated\nwith those field transformations that involve the relative velocity. That the free current density\nis altered by the relative motion of the net free charge in the EQS system is not surprising. But, it\nis the contribution of this same convection current to Ampere's law that generates the velocity depend-\nent contribution to the EQS magnetic field measured in the moving frame of reference. Similarly, the\nvelocity dependent contribution to the MQS electric field transformation is a direct consequence of\nFaraday's law.\nThe transformations, like the quasistatic laws from which they originate, are approximate. It\nwould require Lorentz transformations to carry out a similar procedure for the exact electrodynamic\nlaws of Sec. 2.2. The general laws are not invariant in form to a Galilean transformation, and there-\nin is the origin of special relativity. Built in from the start in the quasistatic field laws is a\nself-consistency with other Galilean invariant laws describing mechanical continua that will be brought\nin in later chapters.\n2.6 Integral Theorems\nSeveral integral theorems prove useful, not only in the description of electromagnetic fields but\nalso in dealing with continuum mechanics and electromechanics. These theorems will be stated here with-\nout proof.\nIf it is recognized that the gradient operator is defined such that its line integral between two\nendpoints (a) and (b) is simply the scalar function evaluated at the endpoints, thenl\nI w4=\n-M)\n(1)\na\nTwo more familiar theorems1 are useful in dealing with vector functions. For a closed surface S, en-\nclosing the volume V, Gauss' theorem states that\nV*AdV =\n'-nda\n(2)\nV\nS\nwhile Stokes's theorem pertains to an open surface S with the contour C as its periphery:\nSV x A-1da =\nA'\n(3)\nS\nC\nIn stating these theorems, the normal vector is defined as being outward from the enclosed voluge for\nGauss' theorem, and the contour is taken as positive in a direction such that It is related to n by the\nright-hand rule. Contours, surfaces, and volumes are sketched in Fig. 2.6.1.\nA possibly less familiar theorem is the generalized Leibnitz rule.2 In those cases where the\nsurface is itself a function of time, it tells how to take the derivative with respect to time of the\nintegral over an open surface of a vector function:\n1.

The velocity vs is the velocity\nof the surface and the contour. Unless given a physical significance, its meaning is purely geometrical.\nA limiting form of the generalized Leibnitz rule will be handy in dealing with closed surfaces.\nLet the contour C of Eq. 4 shrink to zero, so that the surface S becomes a closed one. This process can\nbe readily visualized in terms of the surface and contour sketch in Fig. 2.6.1c if the contour C is\npictured as the draw-string on a bag. Then, if C\nV-1, and use is made of Gauss' theorem (Eq. 2),\nEq. 4 becomes a statement of how to take the time derivative of a volume integral when the volume is a\nfunction of time:\ndV = f\ndV +\ns.nda\n(5)\ntV\nVt\nS\nAgain, vs is the velocity of the surface enclosing the volume V.\n2.7 quasistatic Integral Laws\nThere are at least three reasons for desiring Maxwell's equations in integral form. First, the\nintegral equations are convenient for establishing jump conditions implied by the differential\nequations. Second, they are the basis for defining lumped parameter variables such as the voltage,\ncharge, current, and flux. Third, they are useful in understanding (as opposed to predicting) physical\nprocesses. Since Maxwell's equations have already been divided into the two quasistatic systems, it\nis now possible to proceed in a straightforward way to write the integral laws for contours, surfaces,\nand volumes which are distorting, i.e., that are functions of time. The velocity of a surface S is v .\nTo obtain the integral laws implied by the laws of Eqs. 2.3.23-27, each equation is either\n(i) integrated over an open surface S with Stokes's theorem used where the integrand is a curl operator\nto convert to a line integration on C and Eq. 2.6.4 used to bring the time derivative outside the\nintegral, or (ii) integrated over a closed volume V with Gauss' theorem used to convert integrations\nof a divergence operator to integrals over closed surfaces S and Eq. 2.6.5 used to bring the time\nderivative outside the integration:\n(E\n(E\n+ P).-da =\nfdV\nS\nV\nJnda\nI\nfdV = 0\nS\nV\nH.\n= IJf da\n(1)\nC\nS\n110 (H + M).nda - 0\n(2)\nS\n.\n-o(H\n+ M)*nda\n(3)\nC\nS\n-\nOPM x (:v-\n).h%\nC\nSecs. 2.6 & 2.7\n2.10\n\nH1.£ = J i.nda +\n(e E + P).n'da\nC\nS\nS\n+ F P x (v -\n')*\nC\nSJo(H + M)-nda = 0\nS\nwhere\nJ-\nJ - VsPf\n+\n4.\n.\nH' =H - v x sE\ns\no\nSf.-nda = 0\nS\n+ P).nda =\nPfdV\nV\nwhere\n4' -E+\ns\nx\n.\nE' -E+v\nxIIH\nThe primed variables are simply summaries of the variables found in deducing these equations. However,\nthese definitions are consistent with the transform relationships found in Sec. 2.5, and the velocity\nof these surfaces and contours, vs, can be identified with the velocity of an inertial frame instan-\ntaneously attached to the surface or contour at the point in question. Approximations implicit to the\noriginal differential quasistatic laws are now implicit to these integral laws.\n2.8 Polarization of Moving Media\nEffects of polarization and magnetization are included in the formulation of electrodynamics\npostulated in Sec. 2.2.\nIn this and the next section a review is made of the underlying models.\nConsider the electroquasistatic systems, where the dominant field source is the charge density.\nNot all of this charge is externally accessible, in the sense that it cannot all be brought to some\nposition through a conduction process. If an initially neutral dielectric medium is stressed by an\nelectric field, the constituent molecules and domains become polarized. Even though the material\nretains its charge neutrality, there can be a local accrual or loss of charge because of the polariza-\ntion. The first order of business is to deduce the relation of such polarization charge to the polari-\nzation density.\nFor conceptual purposes, the polarization of a material is pictured as shown in Fig. 2.8.1.\nFig. 2.8.1.\nModel for dipoles fixed to deformable material. The model pictures\nthe negative charges as fixed to the material, and then the positive\nhalves of the dipoles fixed to the negative charges through internal\nconstraints.\nSecs. 2.7 & 2.8\n2.11\n\nFig. 2.8.2\nPolarization results in net\ncharges passing through a\nsurface.\nThe molecules or domains are represented by dipoles composed of positive and negative charges +q,\nseparated by the vector distance 1. The dipole moment is then $ = qp, and if the particles have a\nnumber density n, the polarization density is defined as\nP = nqa\n(1)\nIn the most common dielectrics, the polarization results because of the application of an external\nelectric field.\nIn that case, the internal constraints (represented by the springs in Fig. 2.8.1)\nmake the charges essentially coincident in the absence of an electric field, so that, on the average,\nthe material is (macroscopically) neutral. Then,.with the application of the electric field, there\nis a separation of the charges in some direction which might be coincident with the applied electric\nfield intensity. The effect of the dipoles on the average electric field distribution is equivalent\nto that of the medium they model.\nTo see how the polarization charge density is related to the polarization density, consider the\nmotion of charges through the arbitrary surface S shown in Fig. 2.8.2. For the moment, consider the\nsurface as being closed, so that the contour enclosing the surface shown is shrunk to zero. Because\npolarization results in motion of the positive charge, leaving behind the negative image charge, the net\npolarization charge within the volume V enclosed by the surface S is equal to the negative of the net\ncharge having left the volume across the surface S. Thus,\nf\npdV = -\nnq.i~da = -\n*\"-da\n(2)\nP\nJ\nJ\nS\nS\nGauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, converts the surface integral to one over the arbitrary volume V. It\nfollows that the integrand must vanish so that\n4.\np\n= -\nV.P\n(3)\nThis polarization charge density is now added to the free charge density as a source of the electric\nfield intensity in Gauss' law:\nV.E = Pf +Pp\n(4)\nand Eqs. 3 and 4 comprise the postulated form of Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a.\nBy definition, polarization charge is conserved, independent of the free charge. Hence, the\npolarization current I is defined such that it satisfies the conservation equation\np\napp\nV*J + at-= 0\n(5)\np\nat\nTo establish the way in which J transforms between inertial reference frames, observe that in a primed\nframe of reference, by dint of Eq. 2.5.2c, the conservation of polarization charge equation becomes\nBap'\nV. [, + up'] + L=\n(6)\nIt has been shown that P, and hence pp, are the same in both frames (Eq. 2.5.10a).\nIt follows that the\nrequired transformation law is\nSJ -\nup\n(7)\np\np\np\nIf the dipoles are attached to a moving medium, so that the negative charges move with the same\nvelocity l as the moving material, the motion gives rise to a current which should be included in\nAmpere's law as a source of magnetic field. Even if the material is fixed, but the applied field is\nSec. 2.8\n2.12\n\ntime-varying so as to induce a time-varying polarization density, a given surface is crossed by a net\ncharge and there is a current caused by a time-varying polarization density. The following steps\ndetermine the current density 1p in terms of the polarization density and the material velocity.\nThe starting point is the statement\nS-nda =\nP.nda\n(8)\nP\nddt f\nS\nS\nThe surface S, depicted by Fig. 2.8.2, is attached to the material itself. It moves with the\nnegative charges of the dipoles. Integrated over this deforming surface of fixed identity, the polari-\nzation current density evaluated in the frame of reference of the material is equal to the rate of\nchange with respect to time of the net charge penetrating that surface.\nWith the surface velocity identified with the material velocity, Eq. 2.6.4 and Eq. 3 convert\nEq. 8 to\nap+4\naf\nt\nP\n+ f ' x v.\n(9)\nS\nS\nOn the left, J' is replaced by Eq. 7 evaluated with u = v, while on the right Stokes's theorem,\nEq. 2.6.3, is Rsed to convert the line integral to a surface integral. The result is an equation in\nsurface integrals alone. Although fixed to the deforming material, the surface S is otherwise arbitrary\nand so it follows that the required relation between 3p and I for the moving material is\n+\n1P\n+10\nJ =\n+ V x(P\n)\n(10)\np\nat\nIt is this current density that has been added to the right-hand side of Ampere's law, Eq. 2.3.26a,\nto complete the formulation of polarization effects in the electroquasistatic system.\n2.9 Magnetization of Moving Media\nIt is natural to use polarization charge to represent the effect of macroscopic media on the\nmacroscopic electric field. Actually, this is one of two alternatives for representing polarization.\nThat such a choice has been made becomes clear when the analogous question is asked for magnetization.\nIn the absence of magnetization, the free current density is the source of the magnetic field, and it\nis therefore natural to represent the macroscopic effects of magnetizable media on y through an equi-\nvalent magnetization current density. Indeed, this viewpoint is often used and supported by the con-\ntention that what is modeled at the atomic level is really a system of currents (the electrons in their\norbits).\nIt is important to understand that the use of equivalent currents, or of equivalent magnetic\ncharge as used here, if carried out self-consistently, results in the same predictions of physical\nprocesses. The choice of models in no way hinges on the microscopic processes accounting for the mag-\nnetization. Moreover, the magnetization is often dominated by dynamical processes that have more to do\nwith the behavior of domains than with individual atoms, and these are most realistically pictured as\nsmall magnets (dipoles). With the Chu formulation postulated in Sec. 2.2, the dipole model for\nrepresenting magnetization has been adopted.\nAn advantage of the Chu formulation is that magnetization is developed in analogy to polarization.\nBut rather than starting with a magnetic charge density, and deducing its relation to the polarization\ndensity, think of the magnetic material as influencing the macroscopic fields through an intrinsic flux\ndensity poi that might be given, or might be itself induced by the macroscopic A. For lack of evidence\nto support the existence of \"free\" magnetic monopoles, the total flux density due to all macroscopic\nfields must be solenoidal. Hence, the intrinsic flux density 'o\n4 0 , added to the flux density in free\nspace Plo,\nmust have no divergence:\nV.*o(, + M) = 0\n(1)\nThis is Eq. 2.3.24b.\nIt is profitable to think of -V.poM as a source of H. That is, Eq. 1 can\nbe written to make it look like Gauss' law for the electric field:\nV\nH4H= pm; Pm = -V'Vo0\n(2)\nThe magnetic charge density pm is in this sense the source of the magnetic field intensity.\nFaraday's law of induction must be revised if magnetization is present.\nIf\no-M is a magnetic flux\ndensity, then, through magnetic induction, its rate of change is capable of producing an induced electric\nfield intensity. Also, if Faraday's law of induction were to remain valid without alteration, then its\ndivergence must be consistent with Eq. 1; obviously, it is not.\nSecs. 2.8 & 2.9\n2.13\n\nTo generalize the law of induction to include magnetization, it is stated in integral form for a\ncontour C enclosing a surface S fixed to the material in which the magnetized entities are imbedded.\nThen, because 1o(A + M) is the total flux density,\n=E'*£\n= - d\nO(H + M)*nda\nThe electric field E' is evaluated in the frame of reference of the moving contour.

Because S is arbitrary, it then\nfollows that the integrand must vanish:\nV-xE\n((H+ M)\n) ] + V x (vx\noPM)\nThis generalization of Faraday's law is the postulated equation, Eq. 2.3.25b.\n2.10 Jump Conditions\nSystems having nonuniform properties are often modeled by regions of uniform properties, separated\nby boundaries across which these properties change abruptly. Fields are similarly often given a piece-\nwise representation with jump conditions used to \"splice\" them together at the discontinuities. These\nconditions, derived here for reference, are implied by the integral laws. They guarantee that the\nassociated differential laws are satisfied through the singular region of the discontinuity.\nA 71\nFig. 2.10.1.\nVolume element enclosing a boundary. Dimen-\nsions of area A are much greater than A.\nElectroquasistatic Jump Conditions: A section of the boundary can be enclosed by a volume element\nhaving the thickness A and cross-sectional area A, as depicted by Fig. 2.10.1. The linear dimensions of\nthe cross-sectional area A are, by definition, much greater than the thickness A. Implicit to this\nstatement is the assumption that, although the surface can be curvilinear, its radius of curvature must\nbe much greater than a characteristic thickness over which variations in the properties and fields take\nplace.\nThe normal vector n used in this section is a unit vector perpendicular to the boundary and directi\nfrom region b to region a, as.shown in Fig. 2.10.1. Since this same symbol is used in connection with\nintegral theorems and laws to denote a normal vector to surfaces of integration, these latter vectors\nare denoted by 1 .\nn\nFirst, consider the boundary conditions implied by Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a, with Eq. 2.8.3 used to\nintroduce pp. This law is first multiplied by vm and then integrated over the volume V:\nSecs. 2.9 & 2.10\n2.14\n\nvm V\noEdV\nmpfdV\nV\nV\n+ f VmpdV\nV\nHere, v is a coordinate (like x,y, or z) perpendicular to the boundary and hence in the direction of n,\nas shown in Fig. 2.10.1.\nFirst, consider the particular case of Eq. 1 with m = 0.

Thus, with volume charges to either side of the interface, there is an\nabrupt change in the rate of change of the electric field intensity normal to the boundary, but the\nfield is itself continuous. On the other hand, as illustrated by the sketches of Fig. 2.10.2b, if\nthere is an appreciable charge per unit area within the boundary, the electric field intensity is\ndiscontinuous, and undergoes a step discontinuity.\nSec. 2.10\nV\n1_______,\n2.15\n\nA somewhat less familiar situation is that of Fig. 2.10.2c. Within the boundary there are\nregions of large positive and negative charge concentrations with an associated intense electric field\nbetween. In the limit where the boundary becomes very thin, a component of the surface charge density\nbecomes a doublet, and the electric field becomes an impulse.\nThe double layer can be pictured as being positive surface charges disposed on one side of the\nboundary, and negative surface charges distributed on the other, with an internal component of the\nelectric field originating on the positive charges and terminating on the negative ones. The mag-\nnitude of the double layer is equal to the product of the positive surface charge density and the dis-\ntance between these layers, A. In the limit where the layer thickness becomes infinitely thin while the\ndouble-layer magnitude remains constant, the electric field within the double layer must approach\ninfinity. Thus, associated with the doublet of charge density, there is an impulse in the electric field\nintensity, as sketched in Fig. 2.10.2c.\nThe boundary condition to be used in connection with a double layer is found from Eq. 1 by letting\nm = 1. The left-hand side of Eq. 1 can be integrated by parts, so that it becomes\nf V.(EoV\n)dV - f\nE.*VvdV =\nV(pf + p )dV\n(4)\nV\nV\nV\nFor the incremental volume, the surface double layer density is defined as\np\nlim 1 f v(pf + pp)dV =\nv(p + p )dv\n(5)\nand so the right-hand side of Eq. 4 is ApE. The origin of the A axis remains to be defined but A\nv -v\nTo glean a jump condition from the equation, the second EQS law is incorporated. That I is irrotational,\nEq. 2.3.24a, is represented by defining the electric potential\nE = -VO\n(6)\nThus, the second term on the left in Eq. 4 becomes\nJe E*VvdV = -\nVO*VvdV = - f\nV*(OVv)dV + fE V2 vdV\n(7)\nV\nV\nV\nV\nEvaluation of V2v gives nothing because v is defined as a local Cartesian coordinate. The last inte-\ngral vanishes, and with the application of Gauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, it follows that Eq. 4 becomes\nr\nV-.t da + f e IVv.i da - Ap\n(8)\nSo\nn\no\nn\nA\nS\nS\nProvided that within the layer, E parallel to the interface and Q are finite (not impulses in the limit\nA÷0), Eq. 8 only has contributions to the surface integrals from the regions to either side of the inter-\nface. Thus,\nAEo(vEa -\nv Eb).\n+ Ae 0\n= ApE\n(9)\nThe origin of the v axis is adjusted to make the first term vanish. The required boundary condition\nto be associated with Eqs. 2.3.23a and 2.3.23b is\no II D= EP\n(10)\nThe gradient of Eq. 10 within the plane of the interface converts the jump condition to one in\nterms of the electric field:\nEo a\nID\n- VEZE\n(11)\nHere VE is the surface gradient and t denotes components tangential to the interfacial plane.\nIn the absence of a double-layer surface density, these last two boundary conditions are the\nfamiliar statement that the tangential electric field intensity at a boundary must be continous. The\nstatement given in Eq. 10 that the potential must be continuous at a boundary is another way of stating\nSec. 2.10\n2.16\n\nthis requirement on the tangential electric field intensity. With a double layer, the tangential elec-\ntric field intensity is discontinuous, as is also the potential.\nEquations 10 and 11 could also be derived using the condition that the line integral of the electric\nfield intensity around a closed loop intersecting the boundary vanish. Usually, the tangential electric\nfield is continuous because there is no contribution to this line integral from those segments of the\ncontour passing through the boundary. However, with the double layer, the electric field intensity with-\nin the boundary is infinite; so, even though the segments of the line integral across the boundary vanish\nas A -\n0, there is a net contribution from these segments of the integration.\nIt is clear that higher order singularities could also be handled by considering values of m in\nEq. 1 greater than unity. However, the doublet is as singular a charge distribution as of interest\nphysically.\nThere are two reasons for wishing to include the doublet charge distribution, one mathematical and\none physical. Just as the surface charge density is a singularity in the volume charge density which\ncan be used to terminate a normal electric field intensity at a boundary, the double layer is a termination\nof a tangential electric field. On the physical side, there are many situations in which a double layer\nactually exists within a very thin region of material. Double layers abound at interfaces between liquids\nand metals and between metals. The double-layer concept is useful for modeling electromechanical coupling\ninvolving these interfacial regions.\nSo far, those EQS laws have been considered that do not explicitly involve time rates of change.\nConservation of charge does involve a dynamic term. Its associated boundary conditions can therefore\nbe derived only by making further stipulations as to the nature of the boundary. It is now admitted that\nthe boundary can, in general, be one which is deforming. Because time did not appear explicitly in the\nprevious derivations of this section, the conditions derived are automatically appropriate, even if the\nboundary is moving.\nThe integral form of charge conservation, Eq. 2.7.3a, is written for a volume V and surface S\ntied to the material itself.\nThus, with _\n+-,\n(J\n- pf-V)ida = -\np dV\n(12)\nS\nV\nAs seen in Fig. 2.10.1, the volume of integration always encloses material of fixed identity and inter-\nsects the boundary. Implicit to this statement is the assumption that the boundary is one of demarca-\ntion between material regions. The material velocity is presumed to at most have a step singularity\nacross the boundary.\n(It is important to recognize that there are other types of boundaries. For\nexample, the boundary could be a shock front, with a gas moving through from one side of the interface\nto the other. In that case, the boundary conditions thus far derived would remain correct, because no\nmention has yet been made of the physical nature of the boundary.)\nThe left-hand side of Eq. 12 can be handled in a manner similar to that already illustrated, since\nit does not involve time rates of change. The integration is divided into two parts: one over the upper\nand lower surfaces of the volume, the other over the parts of the surface which intersect the boundary.\nThe contributions to a current flow through these side surfaces comes from a surface current.\nIt follows\nby using a two-dimensional form of Gauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, that the left-hand side of Eq. 12 is\nf (J - PfV)T.nda + Ji\n- Pfy).\nda = A{n.\n- vpf0 + V\nf -\nvt)}\n(13)\nS'+S\"\nS\"'\nHere, A is the area of intersection between the volume element and the boundary. The right-hand side of\nEq. 12 is, by the definition of Eq. 3,\nSjpfdV =~\nafda\n(14)\nV\nA\nNote that, if the volume of integration V, and hence the area of integration A, is one always fixed to\nthe material, then the area A is time-varying. The surface charge density is a function only of the\ntwo dimensions within the plane of the interface. Thus, the term on the right in Eq. 14 is a time\nderivative of a two-dimensional integral. This is a two-dimensional special case of the situation\ndescribed by the generalized Leibnitz rule, Eq. 2.6.5, which stated how the time derivative of a volume\nintegral could be represented, even if the volume of integration were time-varying. Thus, Eq. 14 becomes\ndt PfdV = A[-\n+ V(vt f)\n(15)\n2.1\n2.17\nSec. 2.10\n\nFinally, with the use of Eqs. 13 and 15, Eq. 12 becomes the required jump condition representing charge\nconservation:\nSJfPfV\n- p\n+ VK f =\nt\n(16)\nBy contrast with Eqs. 10 and 11, the expression is specialized to interfaces that do not support charge\ndistributions so singular as a double layer. In using Eq. 16, note that a partial derivative with\nrespect to time is usually defined as one taken holding the spatial coordinates constant. A review of\nthe derivation of Eq. 16 will make it clear that such is not the significance of the partial derivative\non the right in Eq. 16. The surface charge density is not defined throughout the three-dimensional\nspace. Thus, this derivative means the partial derivative with respect to time, holding the coordinates\nwithin the plane of the interface constant.\nThe component of current normal to the boundary represented by the first term in Eq. 16 will be\nrecognized as the free current density in a frame of reference moving with the boundary. A good questior\nwould be, \"why is it that the normal current density appears in Eq. 16 evaluated in the primed frame of\nreference, while the surface free current density is not?\" The answer points to the physical situation\nfor which Eq. 16 is appropriate. As the material boundary moves in the normal direction, the material\nahead and behind carries a charge distribution along, but one that never reaches the boundary.

Thus, the surface divergence appearing in the second\nterm of Eq. 16 can include both a conduction surface current and a convection surface current.\nMagnetoquasistatic Jump Conditions: The integral forms of Ampere's law and Gauss' law for magnetic\nfields incorporate no time rates of change. Hence, the jump conditions implied by these laws are\nfamiliar from elementary electrodynamics. Ampere's law, Eq. 2.7.1b, is integrated over the surface S\nand around the contour C enclosing the boundary, as sketched in Fig, 2.10.3, to obtain\nS\n= K\n(17)\nwhere Kf is the surface current density. Although it is entirely possible to consider a doublet of\ncurrent density as a model, this impulsive singularity in the distribution of free current density is\nof as high an order as necessary to model MQS electromechanical situations of general interest.\nFrom Gauss' law for magnetic fields, Eq. 2.7.2b,\napplied to the incremental volume enclosing the interface,\nFig. 2.10.1, the jump condition is\n*1o(H\nW + WIf = 0\n(18)\nFaraday's law of induction brings into play the time\nrate of change, and it is expected that motion of the\nboundary leads to an addition to the jump condition not\nfound for stationary media.

Contour of integration C\nC\nS\nenclosing a surface S that inter-\nsects the boundary between regions\nWith Eq. 19, it has already been assumed that the boundary\n(a) and (b).\nis a material one. Consistent with Eq. 17 is the assumption\nthat it can be carrying a surface current with it as it deforms.\nIf the surface S were not one of fixed\nidentity, this would mean that the surface integral on the right could be a step function of time as the\nboundary passed through the surface of integration. The result would be a temporal impulse on the right\nwhich would make a contribution to the boundary condition even in the limit where the surface S becomes\nvanishingly small.\nBy contrast, because the surface S is one of fixed identity, in the limit where the\nsurface area vanishes, the right-hand side of Eq. 19 makes no contribution.\nWith the assumption that fields and velocity are at most step functions across the boundary, the\nintegral on the left in Eq. 19 gives\nnix\nl+ v+x p0DH\n= 0\n(20)\nThis expression is what would be expected, in view of the transformation law for the electric field in\nSec. 2.10\n2.18\n\nthe MQS system.

Similarly, Eq. 24b follows from the solenoidal nature of the MQS current density.\nFinally, Eq. 24a follows from the EQS form of Ampere's law, integrated over the surface S of Fig. 2.10.3,\nfollowing the line of reasoning used in connection with Eq. 20.\n2.11 Lumped Parameter Electroquasistatic Elements\nLumped parameter electromechanical models are sufficiently practical that they warrant detailed\nexamination.1\nEven though the electromechanical coupling may be of a definitely continuum and dis-\ntributed nature, it is most often the case that interest is in inputs and outputs at discrete terminal\npairs.\nThis section reviews the definition of energy storage elements in EQS systems.\nAn abstract representation of a system of perfectly conducting electrodes, each having a potential\nvi relative to a reference electrode, is shown in Fig. 2.11.1.

Perfectly conducting coils are excited at their terminals by currents ii\nand, in general, coupled together by the induced magnetic flux. The surrounding medium is magnetizable\nSecs. 2.11 & 2.12\n2.20\n\nFig. 2.12.1\nSchematic representation\n()\nof a system of perfectly\nconducting coils. The\nith coil is shown with the\n(b)\nwire assuming the contour\nCi enclosing a surface Si.\nThere is a total of n coils\nin the system.\nbut free of electrical losses. The total flux Ai linked by the ith coil is a terminal variable, defined\nsuch that\n=\nBnda\n(1)\nSi\nA positive A is determined by first assigning the direction of a positive current ii. Then, the direc-\ntion of the normal vector (and hence the positive flux) to the surface Sienclosed by the contour Ci\nfollowed by the current ii,has a direction consistent with the right-hand rule, as Fig. 2.12.1 illus-\ntrates.\nBecause the MQS current density is solenoidal, the same current flows through the cross section\nof the wire at any point. Thus, the terminal current is defined by\n=\nJ\nf\nin\nda\n(2)\nsi\nwhere the surface si intersects all of the cross section of the wire at any point, as illustrated in the\nfigure.\nThe first two MQS equations are sufficient to determine the flux linkages as a function of the cur-\nrent excitations and the geometry of the coil. Thus, Ampere's law and the condition that the magnetic\nflux density be solenoidal are solved to obtain relations having the form\nAi\ni(il\"\n**in, 1''\nm)\n(3)\nIf the materials involved are magnetically linear, so that B = pH, where p is a function of position but\nnot of time or the fields, then it is convenient to define inductance parameters which depend only on\nthe geometry:\nfI\nThe inductance Lij is the flux linked by the ith coil per unit current in the jth coil, with all other\ncurrents zero.

By contrast with the EQS fields, the electric field here is not irrotational.\nThis\nmeans that the remaining integration of the electric field intensity between the terminals must be care-\nfully defined. Usually, the terminals are located in a region in which the magnetic field is sufficiently\nsmall to take the electric field intensity as being irrotational, and therefore definable in terms of the\ngradient of the potential.

Results are a first step in the derivation of macroscopic force densities\nin Chap. 3. Energy storage in a conservative EQS system is considered first, followed by a statement\nof power flow. In this and the next section the macroscopic medium is at rest.\nThermodynamics: Whether in electric or magnetic form, energy storage follows from the definition\nof the electric field as a force per unit charge. The work required to transport an element of charge,\n6q, from a reference position to a position p in the presence of the electric field intensity is\n6w= -P\n6qE.di\n(1)\nref\nThe integral is the work done by the external force on the electric subsystem in placing the charge at p.\nIf this process can be reversed, it can be said that the work done results in a stored energy equal to\nEq. 1. In an electroquasistatic system, the electric'field is irrotational. Hence,\n-Vt.\nThen, if\nOref is defined as zero, it follows that Eq. 1 becomes\n6w = fP6qVa .P = 6qO\n(2)\nref\nwhere use has been made of the gradient integral theorem, Eq. 2.6.1. Consider now energy storage in\nthe system abstractly represented by Fig. 2.13.1.\nThe system is perfectly insulating, except for the\nperfectly conducting electrodes introduced into the volume of interest, as in Sec. 2.11. It will be\ntermed an \"electroquasistatic thermodynamic subsystem.\"\nThe electrodes have terminal variables as defined in Sec. 2.11; voltages vi and total charges qi.\nBut, in addition, the volume between the electrodes supports a free charge density pf. By definition,\nthe energy stored in assembling these charges is equal to the work required to carry the charges from a\nreference position to the positions of interest. Thus, the incremental energy storage associated with\nincremental changes in the electrode charges, 6qi, or in the charge density, 6Pf, in a given neighbor-\nhood on the insulator, is\nSecs. 2.12 & 2.13\n2.22\n\n-\n--\n--------------\n--------\n-\n------------------\nI - -\n--r--\n- --..\n.-\n\\\\\n\\\"\n'(\n\\%\n:;;;\nth\nlectrodE\n,Pf)\nFig. 2.13.1\nSchematic representation\nof electroquasistatic\nsystem composed of per-\nfectly conducting elec-\ntrodes imbedded in a per-\nfectly insulating dielec-\ntric medium.\nn\n6w = E vi 6qi + J @6pfdV\ni=l\nV'\nV1\nThe volume V' is the volume excluded by the electrodes. Note that the reference electrode is not in-\ncluded in the summation, because the electric potential on that electrode is, by definition, zero. The\nwork required to place a free charge at its final position correctly accounts for the polarization,\nbecause the polarization charges induced in carrying the free charges to their final position are re-\nflected in the potential.\nConsider now the field representation of the electroquasistatic stored energy. From Gauss' law\n(Eq. 2.3.23a), the contribution of the summation in Eq. 3 can be represented in terms of an integral\nover the surfaces Si of the electrodes:\nn\n6w = E\n.i6D.nda\n+ f6pfdV\ni=l1\ni DJ\nHere, Di is the potential on the surface Si .\nThe surfaces enclosing the electrodes can be joined to-\ngether at infinity, as shown in Fig. 2.13.1. The resulting simply connected surface encloses all of the\nelectrodes, the wires as they extend to infinity, with the surface completed by a closure at infinity.\nThus, the surface integration called for with the first term on the right in Eq. 4 can be represented\nby an integration over a closed surface. Gauss' theorem is then used to convert this surface integral\nto a volume integration. However, note that the normal vector used in Eq. 4 points into the volume V'\nexcluded by the electrodes and included by the surface at infinity. Thus, in using Gauss' theorem,\na minus sign is introduced and Eq. 4 becomes\n6w = - J V*(6'D)dV + J c6pfdV = f [-WV.6D - 6D-VO + 06pf]dV\nV'\nVI\nV'\nIn rewriting the integral, the identity V*.C = C.VQ + yV-V has been used.\nFrom Gauss' law, 6pf = 6V.D = V*6D.\nIt follows that the first and last terms in Eq. 5 cancel.\nAlso, the electric field is irrotational (\n= -VW).\nSo Eq. 5 becomes\n6w =\nE.6DdV\nV\nThere is no E inside the electrodes, so the integration is now over all of the volume V.\nThe integrand in Eq. 6 is an energy density, and it is therefore appropriate to define the in-\ncremental change in electric energy density as\n6W = E*D\nSec. 2.13\n----------------------------------------\n2.23\n\nThe field representation of the energy, as given by Eqs. 6 and 7, should be compared to that for\nlumped parameters. Suppose all of the charge resided on electrodes. Then, the second term in Eq. 3\nwould be zero, and the incremental change in energy would be given by the first term:\nn\n6w = E vijqi\nComparison of Eqs. 6 and 8 suggests that the electric field plays a role analogous to the terminal voltage,\nwhile the displacement vector is the analog of the charge on the electrodes. If the relationship between\nthe variables P and t, or v and q, is single-valued, then the energy density and the total energy in the\ncontinuum and lumped parameter systems can be viewed, respectively, as integrals or areas under curves\nas sketched in Fig. 2.13.2.\nIf it is more convenient to have all of the voltages,\nrather than the charges, as independent variables, then\nLegendre's dual transformation can be used.

If the charge is distributed throughout\nFig. 2.13.2. Geometric representation\nof energy w, coenergy w', energy\ndensity W, and coenergy density W'\nfor electric field systems.\nthe same incremental change in electro-\nthe volume, Eq. 6 remains valid.\nWith the notion of electrical energy storage goes the concept of a conservative subsystem. In\nthe process of building up free charges on perfectly conducting electrodes or slowly conducting charge\nto the bulk positions (one mechanism for carrying out the process pictured abstractly by Eq. 3), the\nwork is stored much as it would be in cocking a spring. The electrical energy, like that of the spring,\ncan later be released (discharged). Included in the subsystem is storage in the polarization. For\nwork done on polarizable entities to be stored, this polarization process must also be reversible. Here,\nit is profitable to think of the dipoles as internally constrained by spring-like nondissipative\nelements, capable of releasing energy when the polarizing field is turned off. Mathematically, this\nrestriction on the nature of the polarization is brought in by requiring that y and hence y be a single-\nvalued function of the instantaneous g, or that e = 2($). In lumped parameter systems, this is tanta-\nmount to q = q(v) or v = v(q).\nPower Flow: The electric and polarization energy storage subsystem is the field theory generaliza-\ntion of a capacitor. Just as practical circuits involve a capacitor interconnected with resistors\nand other types of elements, in any actual physical system the ideal energy storage subsystem is im-\nbedded with and coupled to other subsystems. The field equations, like Kirchhoff's laws in circuit\ntheory, encompass all of these subsystems. The following discussion is based on forming quadratic\nexpressions from the field laws, and hence relate to the energy balance between subsystems.\nFor a geometrical part of the ith subsystem, having the volume V enclosed by the surface S, a\nstatement of power flow takes the integral form\niin)da\nS\nat\n+\ni- dV =V idV\nV\n(12)\nSec. 2.13\nS1W\n2.24\n\nHere, Si is the power flux density, Wi is the energy density, and *i is the dissipation density.\nDifferent subsystems can occupy the same volume V. In Eq. 12, V is arbitrary, while i distinguishes\nthe particular physical processes considered. The differential form of Eq. 12 follows by applying Gauss'\ntheorem to the first term and (because V is arbitrary) setting the integrand to zero:\naw\nSi+at\ni\n(13)\nThis is a canonical form which will be used to describe various subsystems. In a given region, Wi can\nincrease with time either because of the volumetric source #i or because of a power flux -§:'i into the\nregion across its bordering surfaces.\nFor an electrical lumped parameter terminal pair, power is the product of voltage and current. This\nserves as a clue for finding a statement of power flow from the basic laws.\nThe generalization of the\nvoltage is the potential, while conservation of charge as expressed by Eq. 2.3.25a brings in the free\ncurrent density. So, the sum of Eqs. 2.3.25a and the conservation of polarization charge equation,\nEq. 2.8. 5, is multiplied by 0 to obtain\n[V.

Note that We does not include energy stored by polarizing the medium. Also, it can\nbe shown that V.Se = V.(1 x f), so that 1e is the poynting vector familiar from conventional classical\nelectrodynamics. In the dissipation density, I-.f can represent work done on an external mechanical\nsystem due to polarization forces or, if the polarization process involves dissipation, heat energy\ngiven up to a thermal subsystem.\nThe polarization terms in Oe can also represent energy storage in the polarization. This is illus-\ntrated by specializing Eq. 16 to describe a subsystem in which - is a single-valued function of the\ninstantaneous -, the free current density is purely ohmic, f = at, and the medium is at rest. Then, the\npolarization term from 4e can be lumped with the energy density term to describe power flow in a subsystem\nthat includes energy storage in the polarization:\nawE\nV.E + at\nE\n(17)\nwhere\nS\nQ\n+\nWE\naD\nEE\nEE\no\nSec. 2.13\n2.25\n\nNote that the integral defining the energy density WE, which is consistent with Eq. 7, involves an inte-\ngrand t which is time dependent only through the time dependence of 8: 1 = '[f(t)].\nThus, aWE/at =\nE.(-/at).\nWith the power flux density placed on the right, Eq. 17 states that the energy density decreases\nbecause of electrical losses (note that *E < 0) and because of the divergence of the power density.\n2.14\nConservation of Magnetoquasistatic Energy\nFundamentally, the energy stored in a magnetic field involves the same work done by moving a test\ncharge from a reference position to the position of interest as was the starting point in Sec. 2.13.\nBut, the same starting point leads to an entirely different form of energy storage. In a magnetoquasi-\nstatic system, the net free charge is a quantity evaluated after the fact. A self-consistent representa-\ntion of the fields is built upon a statement of current continuity, Eq. 2.3.26b, in which the free\ncharge density is ignored altogether. Yet, the energy stored in a magnetic field is energy stored in\ncharges transported against an electric field intensity. The apparent discrepancy in these statements is\nresolved by recognizing that the charges of interest in a magnetoquasistatic system are at least of\ntwo species, with the charge density of one species alone far outweighing the net charge density.\nThermodynamics: Because the free current density is solenoidal, a current \"tube\" can be defined as\nshown in Fig. 2.14.1. This tube is defined with a cross section having a normal yn in the direction of\nthe local current density, and a surrounding surface having a normal perpendicular to the local current\ndensity. An example of a current tube is a wire surrounded by insulation and hence carrying a total cur-\nrent i which is the same at one cross section as at another.\nFig. 2.14.1\nCurrent tube defined as having\ncross-sectional area ds per-\npendicular\nto\nthe\nt\ndensity, and an outside surface\nwith a normal vector perpendicular\nto the current density.\ni\nFor bipolar conduction, and a stationary medium, the current density within the tube is related\nto the charge density by the expression\n4.\nJf = pv+ - pv_\n(1)\nHere the conduction process is visualized as involving two types of carriers, one positive, with a charge\ndensity p+, and the other negative, with a magnitude p-. The carriers then have velocities which are,\nrespectively, v+ and\n_..\nEven though there is a current density, in the magnetoquasistatic system there\nis essentially no net charge: pf = p+ -\np- = 0. In an increment of time 6t, the product of the respective\ncharge densities and net displacements is p+v+6t and - p.0.6t. The work done on the charges as they\nundergo these displacements is the energy stored in magnetic form. This work is computed by recognizing\nthat the force on each of the charged species is the product of the charge density and the electric\nfield intensity. Hence, the energy stored in the field by a length of the current tube d£ is to first\norder in differentials dt and ds,\n-(pv\n-p_v\n).E6tdsdi = -Jf*E6tdsdk\n(2)\nThe expression for the free current density, Eg. i, is used on the right to restate the energy stored\nin the increment of time 6t.\nThe unit vector In is defined to be the direction of if. Thus, If =\nCf('n)tn. Because the current density is solenoidal, it follows closed paths. The product If.tnds\nis, by definition, constant along one of these paths, and if Indi is defined as an increment of the\nline integral, it then follows from Eq. 2 that the energy stored in a single current tube is\n1 d(\n(3)\nC\nSecs. 2.13 & 2.14\n2.26\n\nFig. 2.14.2\nSchematic representation of\na magnetoquasistatic energy\nstorage system. Currents\nare either distributed in\ncurrent loops throughout the\nvolume of interest, or con-\nfined to one of n possible\ncontours connected to the\ndiscrete terminal pairs.\nBy contrast with the electroquasistatic system, in which the electric field intensity is induced\nby the charge density (Gauss' law), the electric field intensity in Eq. 3 is clearly rotational. This\nemphasizes the essential role played by Faraday's law of magnetic induction.\nIt is helpful to have in mind at least the abstraction of a physical system. Figure 2.14.2 shows\na volume of interest in which the currents are either distributed throughout the volume or confined to\nparticular contours (coils), the latter case having been discussed in Sec. 2.12.\nFirst, consider the energy stored in the current paths defined by coils having cross-sectional\narea ds. From Eq. 3, this contribution to the total energy is conveniently written as\n-* .nds(\nE.ndG)6t =\nXi\n(4)\nC.\nFaraday's law and the definition of flux linkage, Eqs. 2.12.1 and 2.12.6, are the basis for representing\nthe line integral as a change in the flux linkage.\nBecause the free current density is solenoidal, the distribution of free currents within the\nvolume V excluded by the discrete coils can be represented as the superposition of current tubes. From\nEq. 4 and the integral form of Faraday's law, Eq. 2.7.3b with vs = v = 0 (the medium is fixed), it\nfollows that the energy stored in a current tube is\nSwcurrent tube = Jf\" ndS (\nA.-da)\n(5)\nStube\nThe magnetic flux density is also solenoidal4 and fog this reason it is convenient to introduce the mag-\nnetic vector potential A, defined such that B = V x A, so that the magnetic flux density is automatically\nsolenoidal. With this representation of the flux density in terms of the vector potential, Stokes's\ntheorem, Eq. 2.6.3, converts Eq. 5 to\nJf.*ds r\n6~A.ld=\nr\n(\n.6A)dsdk =\nJ f.dAdV\n(6)\nCtube\nCtube\nVtube\nHere, f is by definition in the direction of tn, so that Jf.61 takes the component of 61 in the tn direc-\ntion. The second equality is based upon recognition that the product as-It is a volume element of the\ncurrent tube, and the line integration constitutes an integration over the volume, Vtube , of the tube.\nTo include all of the energy stored in the distributed current loops, it is necessary only that\nSec. 2.14\nXi\n2.27\n\nthe integral on the right in Eq. 6 be extended over all of the volume occupied by the tubes.\nThe combina-\ntion of the incremental energy stored in the discrete loops, Eq. 4, and that from the distributed current\nloops, Eq. 6, is the incremental total energy of the system\nn\n6w = E\nii\ni +\n.6AdV\n(7)\ni=l i\nIn this expression, V is the volume excluded by the discrete current paths.\nThis incremental magnetic\nenergy storage is analogous to that for the electric field storage represented by Eq, 2.13.3.\nIn retrospect, it is apparent from the derivation that the division into discrete and distributed\ncurrent paths, represented by the two terms in Eq. 7,is a matter of convenience. In representing the\nincremental energy in terms of the magnetic fields alone, it is handy to extend the volume V over all\nof the currents within the volume of interest, including those that might be represented by discrete\nterminal pairs. With this understanding, the incremental change in energy, Eq. 7, is the last term\nonly, with V extended over the total volume. Moreover, Ampere's law represents the current density in\nterms of the magnetic field intensity, and, in turn, the integrand can be rewritten by use of a vector\nidentity (Eq. 8, Appendix B):\n6w =\nV x H.6~dV =\n[H.V x\nA + V.(H x 6iA)]dV\n(8)\nV\nV\nThe last term in Eq. 8 can be converted to a surface integral by using Gauss' theorem. With the\nunderstanding that the system is closed in the sense that the fields fall off rapidly enough at infinity\nso that the surface integration can be ignored, the remaining volume integration on the right in Eq. 8\ncan be used to obtain a field representation of the incremental energy change. With the curl of the\nvector potential converted back to a flux density, Eq. 8 becomes\nw =\nHf\nH\nBdv\n(9)\nV\nThe integrand of Eq. 9 is defined as an incremental magnetic energy density\n6W = H.6B\n(10)\nIt is helpful to note the clear analogy between this energy density and the incremental total energy\nrepresented by lumped parameters.\nIn the absence of volume free current densities that cannot be\nrepresented by discrete terminal pairs, Eq. 7 reduces to the lumped parameter form\nn\n6w =\nE\ni.6X.\n(11)\ni=l\nThe magnetic field intensity plays the continuum role of the discrete terminal currents, and the magnetic\nflux density is the continuum analog of the lumped parameter flux linkages.\nThe situation in this mag-\nnetic case is, of course, analogous to the electrical incremental energy storages in continuum and in\nlumped parameter cases, as discussed with Eqs. 7 and 8 of Sec. 2.13.\nJust as it is often convenient in dealing with electrical lumped parameters to use the voltage\nas an independent variable, so also in magnetic field systems it is helpful to use the terminal currents\nas independent variables. In that case, the coenergy function w' is conveniently introduced as an\nenergy function\nn\n6w' = Z X.6i.\n(12)\ni=l\nIn an analogous way, the co-energy density, w', is defined such that\n6W' = B.6H; W' = H.B - W\n(13)\nPower Flow:\nThus far, the storage of energy in magnetic form has been examined. The postulate\nhas been that all work done in moving the charges against an electric field is stored.\nIn any system\nas a whole this is not likely to be the case.\nThe general magnetoquasistatic laws enable a deduction\nof an equation representing the flow of power, and the rate of change of the stored energy. This places\nSdc. 2.14\n2.28\n\nthe energy storage in the context of a more general system.\nA clue as to how an energy conservation statement might be constructed from the differential mag-\nnetoquasistatic laws is obtained from Eq. 2, which makes it clear that the product of the free current\ndensity and the electric field intensity are closely connected with the statement of conservation of\nenergy. The dot product of the electric field and Ampere's law, Eq. 2.3.23b, is\nE.[V x H -\nJf] - 0\n(14)\nUse of a vector identity 6Eq. 8, Appendix B) makes it possible to rewrite this expression as\n+\n4.\n4.\n4.\n4. 4.\nH.V x E -\nV.(E x H) = E.Jf\n(15)\nWith the additional use of Faraday's law to represent V x E, Eq. 15 takes the form of Eq. 2.13.16, with\nS EExH\ne\n4.\nWe -\nH\n(16)\n4+.+\n4.\no\n+\n-E.J - H.\n-\nx (\n.\nMx\n)\nThese quantities have much the same physical significances discussed in connection with Eq. 2.13.16.\nTo place the magnetic energy storage identified with the thermodynamic arguments in the context of\nan actual system, consider a material which is ohmic and fixed so that 4 = 0 and If = C1. Then the\nsecond term on the right in Eq. 16c is in the form of a time rate of change of magnetization energy\ndensity. Hence, the power flow equation assumes the form of Eq. 2.13.17, with\nWE=\nH*6B\n(17)\no\nSE\n= -QE*E\nImplicit is the assumption that H is a single-valued function of the instantaneous B.\nThe resulting\nenergy density includes magnetization energy and is consistent with Eq. 2.14.10.\n2.15 Complex Amplitudes; Fourier.Amplitudes and Fourier Transforms\nThe notion of a continuum network fs introduced for the first time in the next section. The associ-\nated transfer relations illustrated there are a theme throughout the chapters which follow. Among several\nreasons for their use is the organization they lend to the representation of complicated, largely linear,\nsystems. In this chapter, the continuum networks represent electromagnetic fields. Later, they re-\npresent fluid and (to some degree) solid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and electromechanical continua\nin general. These networks make it possible to set aside one part of a given problem, derive the associ-\nated relations once and for all and accumulate these for later use. Such relations will be picked up over\nand over in solving different problems and, properly understood, are a useful reference.\nComplex Amplitudes:\nIn many practical situations, excitations are periodic in one or two spatial\ndirections, in time or in space and time. The complex amplitude representation of fields, useful in\ndealing with these situations, is illustrated by considering the function O(z,t) which has dependence\non z given explicitly by\nO(z,t) = Re y ( t ) e - j k z\n(1)\nWith the wavenumber k real, the spatial distribution is periodic with wavelength X = 2wr/k and spatial\nphase determined by the complex amplitude 1. For example, if\ny\n=\no(t) is real and k is real, then\nO(z,t) =\no0\n0 (t) cos kz.\nThe spatial derivative of 0 follows from Eq. 1 as\nS Re\n(t)e-jkz\n(2)\n7z\nRe.[-JkZ(t)e\n(2\nSecs. 2.14 & 2.15\n2.29\n\nThe following identifications can therefore be made:\nas\nwith it being understood that even though complex amplitudes are being used, the temporal dependence is\narbitrary. There will be occasions where the time dependence is specified, but the space dependence is\nnot.\nFor example, complex amplitudes will take the form\nQ(z,t) = Re4(z)e j wt\n(4)\nwhere D(z) is itself perhaps expressed as a Fourier series or transform (see Sec. 5.16).\nMost.often, complex amplitudes will be used to represent both temporal gnd spatial dependences:\nD(z,t) = Recej(Wt-kz)\n(5)\nThe (angular) frequency w can in general be complex. If 0 is periodic in time with period T, then T =\n2n/w. For complex amplitudes 0, the identifications are:\n[4(z,t),\n(z,t),\n(z,t)]<>[$,-jk(,jj]\n(6)\nIf w and k are real, Eq. 5 represents a traveling wave. At any instant, its wavelength is 2w/k,\nat any position its frequency is w and points of constant phase propagate in the +z direction with the\nphase velocity w/k.\nFourier Amplitudes and Transforms: The relations between complex amplitudes are identical to those\nbetween Fourier amplitudes or between Fourier transforms provided that these are suitably defined. For\na wide range of physical situations it is the spatially periodic response or the temporal sinusoidal\nsteady state that is of interest. Simple combinations of solutions represented by the complex amplitudes\nthen suffice, and there is no need to introduce Fourier concepts. Even so, it is important to recognize\nat the outset that the spatial information required for analysis of excitations with arbitrary spatial\ndistributions is inherent to the transfer relations based on single-complex-amplitude solutions.\nThe Fourier series represents an arbitrary function periodic in z with fundameqtal periodicity\nlength k by a superposition of complex exponentials.\nIn terms of complex Fourier coefficients $n(t),\nsuch a series is\n-jk\nn z\nQ(z,t) =\nE\n(t)e\nk\n2nI/R; Q* =\nn\n(7)\nn\nn\nn\n-n\nwhere the condition on 4n insures that 0 is real. Thus, with the identification\nn\n+ 4n and k + kn, each\ncomplex exponential solution of the form of Eq. 1 can be taken as one term in the Fourier series.\nThe\nmth Fourier amplitude Om follows by multiplying Eq. 7 by the complex conjugate function exp(jkmz) and.\nintegrating over the length k to obtain only one term on the right. This expression can then be solved\nfor ym to obtain the inverse relation\nz+\nJkmz\nim\nOQ(z,t)e\ndz\n(8)\nz\nIf the temporal dependence is also periodic, with fundamental period T, the Fourier series can also\nbe used to represent the time dependence in Eq. 7:\n+i\n+o\nJ wmt-knz)\nO(z,t)=\nE\nE\ne\n;\n*\n= 8\n(9)\nmn\nmn\n-m-n\nm=--\nn=--\nwhere the condition on the amplitudes insures that O(z,t) is real. One component out of this double sum-\nmation is the traveling-wave solution represented by the complex amplitude form, Eq. 5. The rules given\nby Eqs. 3 and 6 pertain either to the complex amplitudes or the Fourier coefficients.\nThe Fourier transform is convenient if the dependence is not periodic.

Recall that fvdu = uv - fudv and identify\ndu -+ O/azdz and v -\nexp jkz, and it follows that\nS-\nkz dz =\nejk-C -jk +\nejkz dz\n(12)\nFor properly bounded functions the first term on the right vanishes and the second is -jki(k,t).\nThe\ntransform of Ha/Dz is simply -jkl and thus the Fourier transform also follows the rules given with\nEq. 3.\nExtension of the Fourier transform to a second dimension results in the transform pair\nj(ot-ks) dk dw\n0(z,t) =\n0 $(k, w)eJ(t-kz)\n2dk\nd2w\n(13)\nA\n+|\n-j (,t-kz) dt dz\nJ(k,w)\n=\nf\n(z,t)e - j (tkz)dt dz\nwhich illustrates how the traveling-wave solution of Eq. 5 can be viewed as a component of a complicated\nfunction. Again, relations between complex amplitudes are governed by the same rules, Eq. 6, as are the\nFourier amplitudes $(k,w).\nIf relationships are found among quantities $(t), then the same relations hold with c + $ and\nD( )/Bt -÷ jw, because the time dependence exp(jwt)is a particular case of the more general form $(t).\nAverages of Periodic Functions: An identity often used to evaluate temporal or spatial averages of\ncomplex-amplitude expressions is\nRe\nekz Re Bej\n= 1 Re A B*\n(14)\n/z\nwhere ( )zsignifies an average over the length 2w/k and it is assumed that k is real.

Surfaces enclosing these regions are often planar, cylindrical or\nspherical, with the volume then taking the form of a planar layer, a cylindrical annulus or a spherical\nshell. Such volumes and bounding surfaces are illustrated in Tables 2.16.1-3. The question answered\nin this section is: given the potential on the bounding surfaces, what are the associated normal flux\ndensities? Of immediate interest is the relation of the electric potentials to the normal displace-\nment vectors. But also treated in this section is the relation of the magnetic potential to the normal\nmagnetic flux densities. First the electroquasistatic fields are considered, and then the magnetoquasi-\nstatic relations follow by analogy.\nElectric Fields:\nIf any one of the regions shown in Tables 2.16.1-3 is filled with insulating\ncharge-free (pf\nO) material of uniform permittivity e,\nS(-\n)E,\nD =\nE\n(1)\nthe governing field equations are Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a,\nV*D = 0\n(2)\nand the condition that E be irrotational, Eq. 2.3.24a. The latter is equivalent to\nE = -V0\n(3)\nThus, the potential distribution within a volume is described by Laplace's equation\nV20 = 0\n(4)\nIn terms of 4,\nD = -eVO\n(5)\nMagnetic Fields:\nFor magnetoquasistatic fields in an insulating region (Jf = 0) of uniform per-\nmeability\nM= (I--\n1)Hi;.B =pH\n(6)\nThus, from Ampere's law, Eq. 2.3.23b, H is irrotational and it is appropriate to define a magnetic\npotential Y:\nH = -V_\n(7)\nIn addition. there is Eq. 2.3.24b:\nV.B = 0\n(8)\nThus, the potential again satisfies Laplace's equation\nv2y = 0\n(9)\nand in terms of ', the magnetic flux density is\nB = -1VW\n(10)\nComparison of the last two relations to Eqs. 4 and 5 shows that relations now derived for the\nelectric fields can be carried over to describe the magnetic fields by making the identification\nPlanar Layer:\nBounding surfaces at x = A and x = 0, respectively denoted by a and 0, are shown\nin Table 2.16.1. So far as developments in this section are concerned, these are not physical boundaries\nThey are simply surfaces at which the potentials are respectively\n4(A,y,z,t) = Reg\n(t)exp[-j(ky+kz)]; D(0,y,z,t) = Re I 0(t)exp[-j(ky+kzz)]\n(11)\ny( zy\ny\nt\nSecs. 2.15 & 2.16\n2.32\n\nTable 2.16.1. Flux-potential -transfer relations for planar layer in terms of electric\npotential and normal displacement (0,Dx). To obtain magnetic relations,\nsubstitute (Q,Dx,) +e ('Y,.B,).\nThese will be recognized as generalizations of the complex amplitudes introduced with Eq. 2.15.1. That\nthe potentials at the a and $ surfaces can be quite general follows from the discussion of Sec. 2.15,\nwhich shows that the following arguments apply when I is a spatial Fourier amplitude or a Fourier trans-\nform.\nIn view of the surface potential distributions, solutions to Eq. 4 are assumed to take the form\nS=-Re O(x,t) exp[-j(kyy + kzz)]\n(12)\nSubstitution shows that\nd2\n2 = 0; y =Vk2 + k2\n(13)\ndx2\ny\nz\n+yx\nSolutions of this equation are linear combinations of e\nor alternatively of sinh yx and cosh yx.\nWith ~i and 12 arbitrary functions of time, the solution teakes the form\n0$1 sinh yx + 02 cosh yx\n(14)\nThe two coefficients are determined by requiring that the conditions of Eq. 11 be satisfied. For the sim-\nple situation at hand, an instructive alternative to performing the algebra necessary to evaluate (01,02)\nconsists in recognizing that a linear combination of the two solutions in Eq. 14 is sinh y(x - A).\nThus,\nthe solution can be written as the sum of solutions that are individually zero on one or the other of the\nbounding surfaces. By inspection, it follows that\na- sinh.yx _ .; sinh y(x - A)\n(15)\nsinh yA\nsinh yA\nFrom Eqs. 5 and 15,\n1can be determined:\n-e\nRe\na cosh yx -B\ncosh y(x-A)\n- (ky + kz)\n(16)\nx\nax\nRy\nsinh yA\nsinh yA\nEvaluation of this equation at x -\nA gives the displacement vector normal to the a surface, with complex\namplitude ED. Similarly, evaluated at x = 0, Eq. 16\nives D5. The components of the \"flux\" (Nij ) are\nnow determined, given the respective potentials (ci ,B).\nThe transfer relations, Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1,\nsummarize what is found. These relations can be solved for any pair of variables as a function of the\nremaining pair. The inverse transfer relations are also summarized for reference in Table 2.16.1, Eq. (b)\nSec. 2.16\nI\n2.33\n\nI\nx\nYA-\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 2.16.1.\n(a) Transfer coefficients as a function of Ay EA\nk2 + k2\n(b) Distribution of 0 across layer.\nThat the layer is essentially a distributed capacitance (inductance) is emphasized by drawing\nattention to the analogy between the transfer relations and constitutive laws for a system of linear\ncapacitors (inductors). For a two-terminal-pair system, Eq. 2.11.5 comprises two terminal char es\n(ql,q2) expressed as linear functions of the terminal voltages (vl,V2). Analogously, the (D,,Dx)\n(which have units of charge per unit area and an arbitrary time dependence) are given as linear func-\ntions of the potentials by Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1. A similar analogy exists between Eq. 2.12.5,\nexpressing (X1 ,X2 ) as functions of (il,i 2), and the transfer relations between (B ,BO) (units of flux\nper unit area) and the magnetic potentials (TYa,P).\nAccording to Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1, Dx is induced by a \"self term\" (proportional to the potential\nat the same surface) and a \"mutual term.\"\nThe coefficients which express this self- and mutual-coupling\nhave a dependence on ay (2r/y the wavelength in the y-z plane) shown in Fig. 2.16.1a. Written in the\nform of Eq. 15, the potential has components, excited at each surface, that decay to zero, as shown in\nFig. 2.16.1b, at a rate that is proportional to how rapidly the fields vary in the y-z plane. For long\nwaves the decay is relatively slow, as depicted by the case Ay = 0.5, and the mutual-field is almost as\ngreat as the self field. But as the wavelength is shortened relative to A (Ay increased), the surfaces\ncouple less and less.\nIn this discussion it is assumed that y is real, which it is if ky and kz are real.\nIn fact, the\ntransfer relations are valid and useful for complex values of (ky,kz).\nIf these numbers are purely\nimaginary, the field distributions over the layer cross section are periodic.

In terms of the\nLegendre polynomials Pn, these functions are summarized in Table 2.16.3. Note that these solutions are\nclosed. They do not require infinite series for their representation.\nTo the second order differential equation, Eq. 33, there must be a second set of solutions Q.\nBecause these are singular in the interval 0 4 e < 7 , and situations of interest here include the\nentire spherical surface at any given radius, these solutions are not included. The functions Pm play\nthe role of exp(jkz)(say) in cylindrical geometry, while exp(jmo) is analogous to exp(jmO).\nThe radial\ndependence, which is much of the bother in cylindrical coordinates, is actually quite simple in spherical\ncoordinates. From Eq. 31b it is seen that solutions are a linear combination of rn and r-(n+l). With\nthe assumption that surface potentials respectively have the form\nt(a,e,0,t) = Re $ (t)P m (cose)\nexp(jmo)\n(35)\nit follows that the appropriate linear combination is\n[(r)n _\nn+l\nrn\nn+l\n;\nr\n'+\nr\n(36)\n[()n\n_\nn+l\nn\na n+(36)\nThe complex amplitudes (P,PB) determine the combination of cos mo and sin my, constituting the dis-\ntribution of Q with longitudinal distance. For a real amplitude, the distribution is proportional to\ncos my. In the summary of Table 2.16.3, the lowest orders of Pg (cos 0) are tabulated, together with\ndiagrams showing the zones that are positive and negative relative to each other. In the rectangular\nplots, the ordinate is 0( 0 4 7, while the abscissa is 0 < 0 < 27.\nThus, the top and bottom lines are\nthe north and south poles while the lines within are nodes. The horizontal register of each diagram is\ndetermined by the complex amplitude, which determines the phase of exp(jmo).\nEvaluation of the transfer relations given in Table 2.16.3 by Eqs. (a) and (b) is now carried out\nfollowing the same procedure as for the planar layer. From these relations follow the limiting situ-\nations of a solid spherical region or one where the outer surface is well removed from the region of\ninterest summarized for reference by Eqs. (c) and (d) of Table 2.16.3.\nFurther useful aspects of solutions to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates, including\northogonality relations that permit Fourier-like expansions and evaluation of averages, are given in\nstandard references. 5\n2.17 Energy Conservation and quasistatic Transfer Relations\nApplied to one of the three regions considered in Sec. 2.16, the incremental total electric energy\ngiven by Eq. 2.13.6, can be written as\nw = -\nV6DdV = - fV.(6)dV + fV*6DdV\n(1)\nV\nV\nV\nBecause pf = 0, the last integral is zero. The remaining integral is converted to a surface integral by\nGauss' theorem, and the equation reduces to\ndw = -\n066.nda\n(2)\nS\nSimilar arguments apply in the magnetic cases. Because there is no volume free current density,\nH = -VT\nand Eq. 2.14.9 becomes\n6w = -\nd'B'nda\n(3)\nS\nConsider now the implications of these last two expressions for the transfer relations derived in\nSec. 2.16. Discussion is in terms of the electrical relations, but the analogy made in Sec. 2.16 clearl1\npertains as well to Eqs. 2 and 3, so that the arguments also apply to the magnetic transfer relations.\nSuppose that the increment of energy 6w is introduced through S to a volume bounded by sections of\nthe a and B surfaces extending one \"wavelength\" in the surface dimensions. In Cartesian coordinates,\n5. F. B. Hildebrand, loc. cit., pp. 159-165.\nSecs. 2.16 & 2.17\n2.40\n\nthis volume is bounded by (y,z) surfaces extending one wavelength in the y and z directions. In cylin-\ndrical coordinates, the volume is a pie-shaped cylinder subtended by outside and inside surfaces having\nlength 2w/k in the z direction and 2wa/m and 2rB/m respectively in the azimuthal direction. In spherical\ncoordinates, the volume is a sector from a sphere with 0 = 2w/m radians along the equator, 6 extending\nfrom 0 + w and the surfaces at r = a and r = 8.\nIn any of these cases, conservation of energy, as\nexpressed by Eq. 2, requires that\n6w = -aaKKa6D\n+ a\n0B6D8\n(4)\nThe ( )> indicate averages over the respective surfaces of excitation.

Not only does this reduce the vector field to a scalar field, but the potential function\nevaluated on such surfaces as those of \"perfectly\" conducting electrodes becomes a lumped parameter\nterminal variable, e.g., the voltage.\nSolenoidal fields, such as the magnetic flux density B, are for similar reasons sometimes re-\npresented in terms of a vector potential A:\n+\n+\nThus, B automatically has no divergence. Unfortunately, the vector field B is represented in terms of\nanother vectox field A. However, for important two-dimensional or symmetric configurations, a single\ncomponent of A is all required to again reduce the description to one involving a scalar function.\nFour commonly encountered cases are summarized in-Table 2.18.1.\nThe first two are two-dimensional in the usual sense. The field B lies in the x-y (or r-8) plane\nand depends only on these coordinates. The associated vector potential has only a z component. The\nthird configuration, l1ke the second, is in cylindrical geometry, but with B independent of e and hence\nwith A having only an i0 component. The fourth configuration is in spherical geometry with symmetry\nabout the z axis and the vector potential directed along 0..\nLike the scalar potential used to represent irrotational fields, the vector potential is closely\nrelated to lumped parameter variables. If B is the magnetic flux density, i4 is convenient for evalua-\ntion of tje flux linkage X (Eq. 2.12.1).\nFor an incompressible flow, where B is replaced by the fluid\nvelocity v, the vector potential is conveniently used to evaluate the volume rate of flow. In that\napplication, A and A become \"stream functions.\"\nThe connection between the flux linked and the vector potential follows from Stokes's theorem,\nEq. 2.6.3. The flux 1X through a surface S enclosed by a contour C is\n0= f 1da =\na\nV x -tnda=\n1d-\n(2)\nS\nS\nC\nIn each of the configurations of Table 2.18.1, Eq. 2 amounts to an evaluation of the surface integral.\nFor example, in the Cartesian two-dimensional configuration, contributions to the integration around a\ncontour C enclosing a surface having length 2 in the z direction, only come from the legs running in\nthe a direction. Along these portions of the contour, denoted by (a) and (b), the coordinates (x,y) are\nconstant. Hence, the flux through the surface is simply 2 times the difference A(a) - A(b), as sum-\nmarized in Table 2.18.1.\nIn the axisymmetric cylindrical and spherical configurations, r and r sin 6 dependences are\nrespectively introduced, so that evaluation of A essentially gives the flux linked. For example, in\nthe spherical configuration, the flux linked by a surface having inner and outer radii r cos 0 evaluated\nat (a) and (b) is simply\nSA(,rsin e\n.d=\nr sin e 2(r\nsin e)b = 2rI[A(a) -\nA(b)]\n(3)\nC\nUsed in fluid mechanics to represent incompressible fluid flow, A is the Stokel's stream function. Note\nthat the flux is positive if directed through the surface in the direction of n, which is specified in\nterms of the contour C by the right-hand rule.\n2.19 Vector Potential Transfer Relations for Certain Laplacian Fields\nEven in dealing with magnetic fields in regions where Jf = 0,if the flux linkages are of interest,\nit is often more convenient to develop a model in terms of transfer relations specified in terms of a\nvector rather than scalar potential.

By\nappropriate identification of variables, the same relations can be used to describe different regions.\nAs an example, three planar regions are shown in\nFig. 2.20.1. The symbols in parentheses denote positions\nadjacent to the surfaces demarking subregions. At the\nsurfaces, variables can be discontinuous. Hence it is\nnecessary to distinguish variables evaluated on adjacent\nsides of a boundary. The transfer relations describe\nthe fields within the subregions and not across the\nboundaries.\nThe transfer relations of Table 2.16.1 can be\napplied to the upper region by identifying (a)+ (d),\n(0) + (e), A + a and s or P -\nEa or Pa.

Once the surface variables have\nbeen self-consistently determined, the field distributions within the region can be evaluated using the\nbulk distributions evaluated in terms of the surface coefficients. With appropriate surface amplitudes\nand x + x', where the latter is defined for each region in Fig. 2.20.1, Eq. 2.16.15 describes the\npotential distribution.\nThis approach will be used not only in other geometries but in representing mechanical and\nelectromechanical processes.\nSec. 2.20\n2.46\n\nProblems for Chapter 2\nFor Section 2.3:\nProb. 2.3.1\nPerfectly conducting plane parallel plates are shorted at z = 0 and driven by a distributed\ncurrent source at z = -Z, as shown in Fig. P2.3.1.\ni(t)\nFig. P2.3.1\n(a) Apply the normalization of Eq. 4b to Maxwell's equations used to represent the fields between the\nplates.

This is generally possible because the\nconstitutive laws do not typically involve H. Then, if y is required, Eqs. 26a and 26b, together with\na magnetization constitutive law- can be used.\nIt is clear that these relations uniquely define it,\nbecause they stipulate both V x H and V * I.

In such a system the conduction and magnetization constitutive laws\nrespectively take the form\nJf =\n(r,t)(E + vx1 H)\n; M=(H,)\nand Eqs. 23b - 25b together with a knowledge of the material motion can be used to find H and M.\nShow that 1 is then uniquely specified and that recourse to Gauss' Law is made only to make an\n\"after the fact\" evaluation of the charge density.\nFor Section 2.4:\nProb. 2.4.1\nA material suffers a rigid-body rotation about the z axis with constant angular velocity\n0.

In such a system the conduction and magnetization constitutive laws\nrespectively take the form\nJf =\n(r,t)(E + vx1 H)\n; M=(H,)\nand Eqs. 23b - 25b together with a knowledge of the material motion can be used to find H and M.\nShow that 1 is then uniquely specified and that recourse to Gauss' Law is made only to make an\n\"after the fact\" evaluation of the charge density.\nFor Section 2.4:\nProb. 2.4.1\nA material suffers a rigid-body rotation about the z axis with constant angular velocity\n0.

Rationalized MKS units are used not only\nin connection with electrodynamics, but also in dealing with subjects such as fluid mechanics and heat\ntransfer, which are often treated in English units. Unless otherwise given, basic units of meters (m),\nkilograms (kg), seconds (sec), and Coulombs (C) can be assumed.\nTable 2.1.1.\nSummary of electrodynamic nomenclature.\nName\nSymbol\nUnits\nDiscrete Variables\nVoltage or potential difference\nv\n[V] = volts = m2 kg/C sec2\nCharge\nq\n[C] = Coulombs = C\nCurrent\ni\n[A] = Amperes = C/sec\nMagnetic flux\nX\n[Wb] = Weber = m2 kg/C sec\nCapacitance\nC\n[F] = Farad C2 sec 2 /m2 kg\nInductance\nL\n[H] = Henry = m2 kg/C2\nForce\nf\n[N] = Newtons = kg m/sec2\nField Sources\nFree charge density\nPf\nC/m3\nFree surface charge density\n-f\nC/m\nFree current density\n4f\nA/m2\nFree surface current density\nKf\nA/m\nFields (name in quotes is often used for convenience)\n\"Electric field\" intensity\nV/m\n\"Magnetic field\" intensity\nA/m\nElectric displacement\nC/m2\nMagnetic flux density\nWb/m 2 (tesla)\nPolarization density\nC/m2\nMagnetization density\nM\nA/m\nForce density\nF\nN/m3\nPhysical Constants\nPermittivity of free space\n6o = 8.854 x 1012\nF/m\nPermeability of free space\n1o = 4r x 10- 7\nH/m\nAlthough terms involving moving magnetized and polarized media may not be familiar, Maxwell's\nequations are summarized without prelude in the next section. The physical significance of the un-\nfamiliar terms can best be discussed in Secs. 2.8 and 2.9 after the general laws are reduced to their\nquasistatic forms, and this is the objective of Sec. 2.3.\nExcept for introducing concepts concerned\nwith the description of continua, including integral theorems, in Secs. 2.4 and 2.6, and the dis-\ncussion of Fourier amplitudes in Sec. 2.15, the remainder of the chapter is a parallel development of\nthe consequences of these quasistatic laws. That the field transformations (Sec. 2.5), integral laws\n(Sec. 2.7), splicing conditions (Sec. 2.10), and energy storages are derived from the fundamental quasi-\nstatic laws, illustrates the important dictum that internal consistency be maintained within the frame-\nwork of the quasistatic approximation.\nThe results of the sections on energy storage are used in Chap. 3 for deducing the electric and\nmagnetic force densities on macroscopic media. The transfer relations of the last sections are an\nimportant resource throughout all of the following chapters, and give the opportunity to explore the\nphysical significance of the quasistatic limits.\n2.2 Differential Laws of Electrodynamics\nIn the Chu formulation,l with material effects on the fields accounted for by the magnetization\ndensity M and the polarization density P and with the material velocity denoted by v, the laws of\nelectrodynamics are:\nFaraday's law\n4+\n3H\nat\nP--\no\nM\n(+\no\no\nSt\nBt\n1. P. Penfield, Jr., and H. A. Haus, Electrodynamics of Moving Media, The M.I.T. Press, Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, 1967, pp. 35-40.\n\nAmpere's law\nV x H = E\n+\n+ V x (P x v) + J\n(2)\not\nt\nf\nGauss' law\nV*E = -V*P + Pf\n(3)\ndivergence law for magnetic fields\noV.H = -ioV *M\n(4)\nand conservation of free charge\nV'Jf +\n-t = 0\n(5)\nThis last expression is imbedded in Ampere's and Gauss' laws, as can be seen by taking the diver-\ngence of÷-Eq. 2 and exploiting Eq. 3. In this formulation the electric displacement\nand magnetic flux\ndensity B are defined fields:\nD =\nE + P\n(6)\no\n4-\n-\nB =\no(H + M)\n(7)\n2.3\nQuasistatic Laws and the Time-Rate Expansion\nWith a quasistatic model, it is recognized that relevant time rates of change are sufficiently\nlow that contributions due to a particular dynamical process are ignorable. The objective in this\nsection is to give some formal structure to the reasoning used to deduce the quasistatic field equa-\ntions from the more general Maxwell's equations. Here, quasistatics specifically means that times\nof interest are long compared to the time, Tem, for an electromagnetic wave to propagate through the\nsystem.\nGenerally, given a dynamical process characterized by some time determined by the parameters of\nthe system, a quasistatic model can be used to exploit the comparatively long time scale for proc-\nesses of interest. In this broad sense, quasistatic models abound and will be encountered in many\nother contexts in the chapters that follow. Specific examples are:\n(a) processes slow compared to wave transit times in general; acoustic waves and the model is\none of incompressible flow, Alfvyn and other electromechanical waves and the model is less standard;\n(b) processes slow compared to diffusion (instantaneous diffusion models). What diffuses can\nbe magnetic field, viscous stresses, heat, molecules or hybrid electromechanical effects;\n(c) processes slow compared to relaxation of continua (instantaneous relaxation or constant-\npotential models). Charge relaxation is an important example.\nThe point of making a quasistatic approximation is often to focus attention on significant\ndynamical processes. A quasistatic model is by no means static.\nBecause more than one rate process\nis often imbedded in a given physical system, it is important to agree upon the one with respect to\nwhich the dynamics are quasistatic.\nRate processes other than those due to the transit time of electromagnetic waves enter through\nthe dependence of the field sources on the fields and material motion. To have in view the additional\ncharacteristic times typically brought in by the field sources, in this section the free current\ndensity is postulated to have the dependence\nJf = G(r)E + J v(v,pf,H)\n(i)\nIn the absence of motion, Jv is zero. Thus, for media at rest the conduction model is ohmic, with the\nel-ctrical conductivity a in general a funqtion Qf position. Examples of Jv are a convection current\npfv, or an ohmic motion-induced current a(v x\n0oH).\nWith an underbar used to denote a normalized\nquantity, the conductivity is normalized to a typical (constant) conductivity a :\na =\n(r,t)\n(2)\no-\nTo identify the hierarchy of critical time-rate parameters, the general laws are normalized.\nCoordinates are normalized to one typical length X, while T represents a characteristic dynamical time:\n(x,y,z) = (Zx,kY,kz);\nt = Tt\n(3)\nSecs. 2.2 & 2.3\n\nIn a system sinusoidally excited at the angular frequency\n, T= W-1l\nIn a system sinusoidally excited at the angular frequency w, T=w\nThe most convenient normalization of the fields depends on the specific system. Where electro-\nmechanical coupling is significant, these can usually be categorized as \"electric-field dominated\" and\n\"magnetic-field dominated.\"\nAnticipating this fact, two normalizations are now developed \"in parallel,\"\nthe first taking e as a characteristic electric field and the second taking _ as.a characteristic mag-\nnetic field:\nH = H,\nM v = (/),\n=\nJ\no\nv\nT -v\n=\nLf\n-v\npf =-\np E 9\nf , H=-\nH\n0 8 -H,M M\n0 T-\n+\nE=\nP Pf\n.p-, P=f\n,\n-\nP\nIt might be appropriate with this step to recognize that the material motion introduces a characteristic\n(transport) time other than T. For simplicity, Eq. 4 takes the material velocity as being of the order\nof R/T.\nThe normalization used is arbitrary. The same quasistatic laws will be deduced regardless of the\nstarting point, but the normalization will determine whether these laws are \"zero-order\" or higher order\nin a sense to now be defined.\nThe normalizations of Eq. 4 introduced into Eqs. 2.2.1-5 result in\nV.1 = -V.y + pf\nV.E = -V.p +\nV.H = -V-M\nV.H = -V.M\nTm\n+ T\n+.\n+\nE\n9P\n(\nx)\nVxH = -\naE\n+ J +\n+ -- +Vx (P xv)\nVxH = --\nE + J + O\n+ Vx(P x v\nT\nv\n+t ~t\nT\n+\nBtA\n(7)\ne\nH + 3\nV\nx\nS\nH\nVxE\n=\nat\nV x (Mx v)\n(8)\nVxE = -s\nt\nt + Vx ~-V]\n(x\ne\nS F\n~f\nV.\nE + -\nV*J\n-y\nT\nD p\nt+\nV.

The time required for an electromagnetic plane wave to propa-\ngate the distance k at the velocity c is Tem. Given that there is just one characteristic length,\nthere are actually only two characteristic times, because as can be seen from Eq. 10\n(11)\nT\nme\nem\nUnless Te and Tm, and hence Tem, are all of the same order, there are only two possibilities for the\nrelative magnitudes of these times, as summarized in Fig. 2.3.1.\n18W(I\nI\n( 4((1\n_\n~\nI\nIr\nTCe\nem\nm\nTm\n-\nelectroquasistati cs\nmagnetoquasistatics\nFig. 2.3.1.

Note that T is still arbitrary relative to Te.\nIn the magnetoquasistatic (MQS) approximation, 0 is still small, but the ordering of characteristic times\nis as to the right. In this case, T is arbitrary relative to Tm.\nTo make a formal statement of the procedure used to find the quasistatic approximation, the normal-\nized fields and charge density are expanded in powers of the time-rate parameter 0.\nE = E + E1 +\nE\n+\n0 +\n+\n0o\n8 H01\n+2\n(12)\niv -\n( v)o + 0v)\n+0 ( )2 +\nPf = (Pf)o +\n(Pf) 1 +\n()2 +\nIn the following, it is assumed that constitutive laws relate P and M to E and H, so that these\ndensities are similarly expanded. The velocity 4 is taken as given. Then, the series are sub-\nstituted into Eqs. 5-9 and the resulting expressions arranged by factors multiplying ascending\npowers of 0. The \"zero order\" equations are obtained by requiring that the coefficients of 8\nvanish.

Thus higher order fields satisfy homo-\nBoundary conditions\ngeneous boundary conditions.\nOnce the first order solutions are known, the process can be repeated with these forming the\n\"drives\" for the n=2 equations.\nIn the absence of loss effects, there are no characteristic times to distinguish MQS and EQS\nsystems. In that limit, which set of normalizations is used is a matter of convenience. If a situa-\ntion represented by the left-hand set actually has an EQS limit, the zero order laws become the quasi-\nstatic laws.\nBut, if these expressions are applied to a situation that is actually MQS, then first-\norder terms must be calculated to find the quasistatic fields. If more than the one characteristic\ntime Tern is involved, as is the case with finite Te and Tm, then the ordering of rate parameters can\ncontribute to the convergence of the expansion.\nIn practice, a formal derivation of the quasistatic laws is seldom used. Rather, intuition and\nexperience along with comparison of critical time constants to relevant dynamical times is used to\nidentify one of the two sets of zero order expressions as appropriate. But, the use of normalizations\nto identify critical parameters, and the notion that characteristic times can be used to unscramble\ndynamical processes, will be used extensively in the chapters to follow.\nWithin the framework of quasistatic electrodynamics, the unnormalized forms of Eqs. 13-17\nconmrise the \"exact\" field laws\nThese enuations are reordered to reflect their relative imnortance:\nElectroquasistatic (EQS)\nMagnetoquasistatic (MQS)\nV.-E E=\nVx\n(23)\n-V'P\n= f\n+ Pf\nVx = 0\nV.1oH = -V.o M\n(24)\nS\napf\na4,.

With different conduction models will come different\ncharacteristic times,exemplified in the discussions of this section by Te and Tm . Matters are more\ncomplicated if fields and media interact electromechanically. Then, v is determined to some extent\nat least by the fields themselves and must be treated on a par with the field variables. The result\ncan be still more characteristic times.\nThe ordering of the quasistatic equations emphasizes the instantaneous relation between the\nrespective dominant sources and fields. Given the charge and polarization densities in the EQS system,\nor given the current and magnetization densities in the MQS system, the dominant fields are known and\nare functions only of the sources at the given instant in time.\nThe dynamics enter in the EQS system with conservation of charge, and in the MQS system with\nFaraday'l law of induction. Equations 26a and 27a are only needed 4f an after-the-fact determina-\ntion of H is to be made. An example where such a rare interest in H exists is in the small mag-\nnetic field induced by electric fields and currents within the human body. The distribution of in-\nternal fields and hence currents is determined by the first three EQS equations. Given 1, -, and\nJf, the remaining two expressions determine H. In the MQS system, Eq. 27b can be regarded as an\nexpression for the after-the-fact evaluation of pf, which is not usually of interest in such systems.\nWhat makes the subject of quasistatics difficult to treat in a general way,even for a system\nof fixed ohmic conductivity, is the dependence of the appropriate model on considerations not con-\nveniently represented in the differential laws. For example, a pair of perfectly conducting plates,\nshorted on one pair of edges and driven by a sinusoidal source at the opposite pair, will be MQS\nat low frequencies. The same pair of plates, open-circuited rather than shorted, will be electroquasi-\nstatic at low frequencies. The difference is in the boundary conditions.\nGeometry and the inhomogeneity of the medium (insulators, perfect conductors and semiconductors)\nare also essential to determining the appropriate approximation. Most systems require more than one\nSec. 2.3\n\ncharacteristic dimension and perhaps conductivity for their description, with the result that more than\ntwo time constants are often involved. Thus, the two possibilities identified in Fig. 2.3.1 can in\nprinciple become many possibilities. Even so, for a wide range of practical problems, the appropriate\nfield laws are either clearly electroquasistatic or magnetoquasistatic.\nProblems accompanying this section help to make the significance of the quasistatic limits more\nsubstantive by considering cases that can also be solved exactly.\n2.4 Continuum Coordinates and the Convective Derivative\nThere are two commonly used representations of continuum variables.\nOne of these is familiar\nfrom classical mechanics, while the other is universally used in electrodynamics. Because electro-\nmechanics involves both of these subjects, attention is now drawn to the salient features of the two\nrepresentations.\nConsider first the \"Lagrangian representation.\"\nThe position of a material particle is a natural\nexample and is depicted by Fig. 2.4.1a. When the time t is zero, a particle is found at the position\nro .\nThe position of the particle at some subsequent time is t. To let t represent the displacement of\na continuum of particles, the position variable ro is used to distinguish particles.\nIn this sense, the\ndisplacement y then also becomes a continuum variable capable of representing the relative displace-\nments of an infinitude of particles.\n)\n~\nu)\nk U)\nFig. 2.4.1.\nParticle motions represented in terms of (a) Lagrangian coordinates,\nwhere the initial particle coordinate ro designates the particle of\ninterest, and (b) Eulerian coordinates, where (x,y,z) designates the\nspatial position of interest.\nIn a Lagrangian representation, the velocity of the particle is simply\nat\nIf concern is with only one particle, there is no point in writing the derivative as a partial deriv-\native. However, it is understood that, when the derivgtive is taken, it is a particular particle\nwhich is being considered. So, it is understood that ro is fixed. Using the same line of reasoning,\nthe acceleration of a particle is given by\na at\nThe idea of representing continuum variables in terms of the coordinates (x,y,z) connected with\nthe space itself is familiar from electromagnetic theory. But what does it mean if the variable is\nmechanical rather than electrical? We could represent the velocit- of the continuum of particles\nfilling the space of interest by a vector function v(x,y,z,t) = v(r,t).\nThe velocity of particles\nhaving the position (x,y,z,) at a given time t is determined by evaluating the function v(r,t).\nThe\nvelocity appearing in Sec. 2.2 is an example. As suggested by Fig. 2.4.1b, if the function is the\nvelocity evaluated at a given position in space, it describes whichever particle is at that point at\nthe time of interest. Generally, there is a continuous stream of particles through the point (x,y,z).\nSecs. 2.3 & 2.4\n\nComputation of the particle acceleration makes evident the contrast between Eulerian and Lagrangian\nrepresentations. By definition, the acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity computed for a\ngiven particle of matter. A particle having the position (x,y,z) at time t will be found an instant\nAt later at the position (x + vxAt,y + vyAt,z + vzAt).\nHence the acceleration is\nv(x + v At,y + v At,z + v At,t + At) - v(x,y,z,t)\na=lim\nx\ny\nz\n(3)\nAt÷OAt\nExpansion of tje first term in Eq. 3 about the initial coordinates of the particle gives the convective\nderivative of v:\n+\nv\nav\nav\nav _\nv\n+\n+\na\n+ v\n+ v\n+ v z\n+ v*Vv\n(4)\nt\nx ax\ny\ny\n(4)at\nThe difference between Eq. 2 and Eq. 4 is resolved by recognizing the difference in the signi-\nficance of the partial derivatives. In Eq. 2, it is understood that the coordinates being held fixed\nare the initial coordinates of the particle of interest. In Eq. 4, the partial derivative is taken,\nholding fixed the particular point of interest in space.\nThe same steps .show that the rate of change of any vector variable A, as viewed from a particle\nhaving the velocity v, is\nDAaA 31\n+\n(\nS-\n+ (V);\nA = A(x,y,z,t)\n(5)\nThe time rate of change of any scalar variable for an observer moving with the velocity v is obtained\nfrom Eq. 5 by considering the particular case in which t has only one component, say 1 = f(x,y,z,t)Ax.\nThen Eq. 5 becomes\nDf\nf- E - -+\nf\n+f\nv.Vf\n(6)\nReference 3 of Appendix C is a film useful in understanding this section.\n2.5 Transformations between Inertial Frames\nIn extending empirically determined conduction, polarization and magnetization laws to include\nmaterial motion, it is often necessary to relate field variables evaluated in different reference\nframes. A given point in space can be designated either in terms of the coordinate 1 or of the co-\nordinate V' of Fig. 2.5.1. By \"inertial reference frames,\" it is meant that the relative velocity\nbetween these two frames is constant, designated by '. The positions in the two coordinate systems\nare related by the Galilean transformation:\nr'\n= r -\nut;\nt'\n= t\n(1)\nFig. 2.5.1\nReference frames have constant\nrelative velocity t. The co-\nordinates t = (x,y,z) and 1' =\n(x',y',z') designate the same\nposition.\nIt is a familiar fact that variables describing a given physical situation in one reference frame\nwill not be the same as those in the other. An example is material velocity, which, if measured in one\nframe, will differ from that in the other frame by the relative velocity ~.\nThere are two objectives in this section: one is to show that the quasistatic laws are invariant\nwhen subject to a Galilean transformation between inertial reference frames. But, of more use is the\nrelationship between electromagnetic variables in the two frames of reference that follows from this\nSecs. 2.4 & 2.5\n\ntake\nquasistatic\nequations\nthe\nmade\nthe\nis\nthat\nthe\nThe\napproach\nis\nas\nfollows.\nFirst,\npostulate\nproof.\nsame\nform\nin\nthe\nprimed\nand\nunprimed\ninertial\nreference\nframes.\nBut,\nin\nwriting\nthe\nlaws\nin\nthe\nprimed\nframe,\nthe\nspatial\nand\ntemporal\nderivatives\nmust\nbe\ntaken\nwith\nrespect\nto\nthe\ncoordinates\nof\nthat\nref-\nerence\nframe,\nand\nthe\ndependent\nfield\nvariables\nare\nthen\nfields\ndefined\nin\nthat\nreference\nframe.\nIn\nframe\nrelation\nto\nvariables\nin\nthe\nunprimed\nthe\ntheir\ndesignated\nby\nprimes,\nsince\nmust\nbe\ngeneral,\nthese\nis\nnot\nknown.\nFor\nFor\nthe\nthe\npurpose\nnurnose\nof o\nwriting\nwritina\nthe\nthe\nprimed\nnrimd\nequations\nenuations\nof of elctrod-ax\nthe\nelectrodynamics\ncs\nin in\nterms\ntems\nof of the\nun u-\nrimed\nrime\nco-\nordinates, recognize that\nV' + V\nA\na\n)+\n-\n= al\"\na-)+\n(- + u*V)A\n-\n+ uV*A - Vx (ux A)\n( (+ uV9\nt\n+Vu\n+\nE at+\nThe left relations follow by using the chain rule of differentiation and the transformation of Eq. 1.\nThat the spatial derivatives taken with respect to one frame must be the same as those with respect\nto the other frame physically means that a single \"snapshot\" of the physical process would be all\nrequired to evaluate the spatial derivatives in either frame. There would be no way of telling which\nframe was the one from which the snapshot was taken. By contrast, the time rate of change for an\nobserver in the primed frame is, by definition, taken with the primed spatial coordinates held fixed.\nIn terms of the fixed frame coordinates, this is the convective derivative defined with Eqs. 2.4.5\nand 2.4.6. However, v in these equations is in general a function of space and time. In the context\nof this section it is saecialized to the constant u. Thus, in rewriting the convective derivatives of\nEq. 2 the constancy of u and a vector identity (Eq. 16, Appendix B) have been used.\nSo far, what has been said in this section is a matter of coordinates. Now, a physically motivated\npostulate is made concerning the electromagnetic laws. Imagine one electromagnetic experiment that is\nto be described from the two different reference frames. The postulate is that provided each of these\nframes is inertial, the governing laws must take the same form. Thus, Eqs. 23-27 apply with [V - V',\nc(\n)/at - a(\n)/at'] and all dependent variables primed. By way of comparing these laws to those ex-\npressed in the fixed-frame, Eqs. 2 are used to rewrite these expressions in terms of the unprimed in-\ndependent variables. Also, the moving-frame material velocity is rewritten in terms of the unprimed\nframe velocity using the relation\nv'\nv-\nu\nThus, the laws originally expressed in the primed frame of reference become\nV.e E'\nE\n-V.P'\n+ p\nV x i' =\nf\nV x E' = 0\nV*o\nH'\n-V.o0 M'\nal H0'\nay M'\nV.

Similarly, Eq. 5b is used to write Eq. 6b. For the one experi-\nment under consideration, these equations will.predict the same behavior as the fixed frame laws,\nEqs. 2.3.23-27, if the identification is made:\nSec.\n2.5\n\nE- ,\nMQS\n'-\nA\n(9)\n4.\n+\nPE' = P\nM' = M\n(10)\nJ\n= Jf\n(11)\n4.\n+\nS= J\nE'= E + ux\n-\n(12)\nUpf\npoH\nH' .'A-i x eE\n(13)\no\nand hence, from Eq. 2.2.6\nand hence, from Eq. 2.2.7\nD' =D\nB' = B\n(14)\nThe primary fields are the same whether viewed from one frame or the other. Thus, the EQS elec-\ntric field polarization density and charge density are the same in both frames, as are the MQS mag-\nnetic field, magnetization density and current density. The respective dynamic laws can be associated\nwith those field transformations that involve the relative velocity. That the free current density\nis altered by the relative motion of the net free charge in the EQS system is not surprising. But, it\nis the contribution of this same convection current to Ampere's law that generates the velocity depend-\nent contribution to the EQS magnetic field measured in the moving frame of reference. Similarly, the\nvelocity dependent contribution to the MQS electric field transformation is a direct consequence of\nFaraday's law.\nThe transformations, like the quasistatic laws from which they originate, are approximate. It\nwould require Lorentz transformations to carry out a similar procedure for the exact electrodynamic\nlaws of Sec. 2.2. The general laws are not invariant in form to a Galilean transformation, and there-\nin is the origin of special relativity. Built in from the start in the quasistatic field laws is a\nself-consistency with other Galilean invariant laws describing mechanical continua that will be brought\nin in later chapters.\n2.6 Integral Theorems\nSeveral integral theorems prove useful, not only in the description of electromagnetic fields but\nalso in dealing with continuum mechanics and electromechanics. These theorems will be stated here with-\nout proof.\nIf it is recognized that the gradient operator is defined such that its line integral between two\nendpoints (a) and (b) is simply the scalar function evaluated at the endpoints, thenl\nI w4=\n-M)\n(1)\na\nTwo more familiar theorems1 are useful in dealing with vector functions. For a closed surface S, en-\nclosing the volume V, Gauss' theorem states that\nV*AdV =\n'-nda\n(2)\nV\nS\nwhile Stokes's theorem pertains to an open surface S with the contour C as its periphery:\nSV x A-1da =\nA '\n(3)\nS\nC\nIn stating these theorems, the normal vector is defined as being outward from the enclosed voluge for\nGauss' theorem, and the contour is taken as positive in a direction such that It is related to n by the\nright-hand rule. Contours, surfaces, and volumes are sketched in Fig. 2.6.1.\nA possibly less familiar theorem is the generalized Leibnitz rule.2 In those cases where the\nsurface is itself a function of time, it tells how to take the derivative with respect to time of the\nintegral over an open surface of a vector function:\n1.

The velocity vs is the velocity\nof the surface and the contour. Unless given a physical significance, its meaning is purely geometrical\nA limiting form of the generalized Leibnitz rule will be handy in dealing with closed surfaces.\nLet the contour C of Eq. 4 shrink to zero, so that the surface S becomes a closed one. This process can\nbe readily visualized in terms of the surface and contour sketch in Fig. 2.6.1c if the contour C is\npictured as the draw-string on a bag. Then, if C\nV-1, and use is made of Gauss' theorem (Eq. 2),\nEq. 4 becomes a statement of how to take the time derivative of a volume integral when the volume is a\nfunction of time:\ndV = f\ndV +\ns. nda\n(5)\ntV\nVt\nS\nAgain, vs is the velocity of the surface enclosing the volume V.\n2.7 quasistatic Integral Laws\nThere are at least three reasons for desiring Maxwell's equations in integral form. First, the\nintegral equations are convenient for establishing jump conditions implied by the differential\nequations. Second, they are the basis for defining lumped parameter variables such as the voltage,\ncharge, current, and flux. Third, they are useful in understanding (as opposed to predicting) physical\nprocesses. Since Maxwell's equations have already been divided into the two quasistatic systems, it\nis now possible to proceed in a straightforward way to write the integral laws for contours, surfaces,\nand volumes which are distorting, i.e., that are functions of time. The velocity of a surface S is v .\nTo obtain the integral laws implied by the laws of Eqs. 2.3.23-27, each equation is either\n(i) integrated over an open surface S with Stokes's theorem used where the integrand is a curl operator\nto convert to a line integration on C and Eq. 2.6.4 used to bring the time derivative outside the\nintegral, or (ii) integrated over a closed volume V with Gauss' theorem used to convert integrations\nof a divergence operator to integrals over closed surfaces S and Eq. 2.6.5 used to bring the time\nderivative outside the integration:\n(E\n(E\n+ P).-da =\nfdV\nH.\n= IJ f da\n(1)\nS\nV\nC\nS\n110 (H + M).nda - 0\n(2)\nS\nJnda\nI\nfdV = 0\n.\n-o(H\n+ M)*nda\n(3)\nS\nV\nC\nS\n-\nOPM x (:v- ).h%\nC\nSecs. 2.6 & 2.7\n2.10\n.\n\nH 1.£ = J i.nda +\n(e E + P).n'da\nSf.-nda = 0\nC\nS\nS\nS\n+ F P x (v -\n')*\nC\nSJo(H + M)-nda = 0\n+ P).nda =\nPfdV\nS\nV\nwhere\nwhere\nx\n4' -E+\n.s\nJ-\nJ\nE' -E+v\nxIIH\n- VsPf\n+\n4 . -\n4.\nH' =H v x sE\ns\no\nThe primed variables are simply summaries of the variables found in deducing these equations. However,\nthese definitions are consistent with the transform relationships found in Sec. 2.5, and the velocity\nof these surfaces and contours, vs, can be identified with the velocity of an inertial frame instan-\ntaneously attached to the surface or contour at the point in question. Approximations implicit to the\noriginal differential quasistatic laws are now implicit to these integral laws.\n2.8 Polarization of Moving Media\nEffects of polarization and magnetization are included in the formulation of electrodynamics\npostulated in Sec. 2.2.\nIn this and the next section a review is made of the underlying models.\nConsider the electroquasistatic systems, where the dominant field source is the charge density.\nNot all of this charge is externally accessible, in the sense that it cannot all be brought to some\nposition through a conduction process. If an initially neutral dielectric medium is stressed by an\nelectric field, the constituent molecules and domains become polarized. Even though the material\nretains its charge neutrality, there can be a local accrual or loss of charge because of the polariza-\ntion. The first order of business is to deduce the relation of such polarization charge to the polari-\nzation density.\nFor conceptual purposes, the polarization of a material is pictured as shown in Fig. 2.8.1.\nFig. 2.8.1.\nModel for dipoles fixed to deformable material. The model pictures\nthe negative charges as fixed to the material, and then the positive\nhalves of the dipoles fixed to the negative charges through internal\nconstraints.\n2.11\nSecs. 2.7 & 2.8\n\nFig. 2.8.2\nPolarization results in net\ncharges passing through a\nsurface.\nThe molecules or domains are represented by dipoles composed of positive and negative charges +q,\nseparated by the vector distance 1. The dipole moment is then $ = qp\n, and if the particles have a\nnumber density n, the polarization density is defined as\nP = nqa\n(1)\nIn the most common dielectrics, the polarization results because of the application of an external\nelectric field.\nIn that case, the internal constraints (represented by the springs in Fig. 2.8.1)\nmake the charges essentially coincident in the absence of an electric field, so that, on the average,\nthe material is (macroscopically) neutral. Then,.with the application of the electric field, there\nis a separation of the charges in some direction which might be coincident with the applied electric\nfield intensity. The effect of the dipoles on the average electric field distribution is equivalent\nto that of the medium they model.\nTo see how the polarization charge density is related to the polarization density, consider the\nmotion of charges through the arbitrary surface S shown in Fig. 2.8.2. For the moment, consider the\nsurface as being closed, so that the contour enclosing the surface shown is shrunk to zero. Because\npolarization results in motion of the positive charge, leaving behind the negative image charge, the net\npolarization charge within the volume V enclosed by the surface S is equal to the negative of the net\ncharge having left the volume across the surface S. Thus,\nf\npdV = -\nnq.i~da = -\n*\"-da\n(2)\nP\nJ\nJ\nS\nS\nGauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, converts the surface integral to one over the arbitrary volume V.

Integrated over this deforming surface of fixed identity, the polari-\nzation current density evaluated in the frame of reference of the material is equal to the rate of\nchange with respect to time of the net charge penetrating that surface.\nWith the surface velocity identified with the material velocity, Eq. 2.6.4 and Eq. 3 convert\nEq. 8 to\na f\nt\nP\nap+\n+ f ' x v.\n(9)\nS\nS\nOn the left, J' is replaced by Eq. 7 evaluated with u = v, while on the right Stokes's theorem,\nEq. 2.6.3, is Rsed to convert the line integral to a surface integral.

Actually, this is one of two alternatives for representing polarization.\nThat such a choice has been made becomes clear when the analogous question is asked for magnetization.\nIn the absence of magnetization, the free current density is the source of the magnetic field, and it\nis therefore natural to represent the macroscopic effects of magnetizable media on y through an equi-\nvalent magnetization current density. Indeed, this viewpoint is often used and supported by the con-\ntention that what is modeled at the atomic level is really a system of currents (the electrons in their\norbits).\nIt is important to understand that the use of equivalent currents, or of equivalent magnetic\ncharge as used here, if carried out self-consistently, results in the same predictions of physical\nprocesses. The choice of models in no way hinges on the microscopic processes accounting for the mag-\nnetization. Moreover, the magnetization is often dominated by dynamical processes that have more to do\nwith the behavior of domains than with individual atoms, and these are most realistically pictured as\nsmall magnets (dipoles). With the Chu formulation postulated in Sec. 2.2, the dipole model for\nrepresenting magnetization has been adopted.\nAn advantage of the Chu formulation is that magnetization is developed in analogy to polarization.\nBut rather than starting with a magnetic charge density, and deducing its relation to the polarization\ndensity, think of the magnetic material as influencing the macroscopic fields through an intrinsic flux\ndensity poi that might be given, or might be itself induced by the macroscopic A. For lack of evidence\nto support the existence of \"free\" magnetic monopoles, the total flux density due to all macroscopic\nfields must be solenoidal. Hence, the intrinsic flux density 'o\n4 0 , added to the flux density in free\nspace Plo,\nmust have no divergence:\nV.*o(, + M) = 0\n(1)\nThis is Eq. 2.3.24b.\nIt is profitable to think of -V.poM as a source of H. That is, Eq. 1 can\nbe written to make it look like Gauss' law for the electric field:\nV\n=\nH4H\n= pm; Pm\n-V'Vo0\n(2)\nThe magnetic charge density pm is in this sense the source of the magnetic field intensity.\nFaraday's law of induction must be revised if magnetization is present.\nIf\no-M is a magnetic flux\ndensity, then, through magnetic induction, its rate of change is capable of producing an induced electric\nfield intensity. Also, if Faraday's law of induction were to remain valid without alteration, then its\ndivergence must be consistent with Eq. 1; obviously, it is not.\n2.13\nSecs. 2.8 & 2.9\n\nTo generalize the law of induction to include magnetization, it is stated in integral form for a\ncontour C enclosing a surface S fixed to the material in which the magnetized entities are imbedded.\nThen, because 1o(A + M) is the total flux density,\n=E'*£\n= - d\nO(H + M)*nda\nThe electric field E' is evaluated in the frame of reference of the moving contour.

Fields are similarly often given a piece-\nwise representation with jump conditions used to \"splice\" them together at the discontinuities. These\nconditions, derived here for reference, are implied by the integral laws. They guarantee that the\nassociated differential laws are satisfied through the singular region of the discontinuity.\nA 71\nFig. 2.10.1.\nVolume element enclosing a boundary. Dimen-\nsions of area A are much greater than A.\nElectroquasistatic Jump Conditions: A section of the boundary can be enclosed by a volume element\nhaving the thickness A and cross-sectional area A, as depicted by Fig. 2.10.1. The linear dimensions of\nthe cross-sectional area A are, by definition, much greater than the thickness A. Implicit to this\nstatement is the assumption that, although the surface can be curvilinear, its radius of curvature must\nbe much greater than a characteristic thickness over which variations in the properties and fields take\nplace.\nThe normal vector n used in this section is a unit vector perpendicular to the boundary and directi\nfrom region b to region a, as.shown in Fig. 2.10.1. Since this same symbol is used in connection with\nintegral theorems and laws to denote a normal vector to surfaces of integration, these latter vectors\nare denoted by 1 .\nn\nFirst, consider the boundary conditions implied by Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a, with Eq. 2.8.3 used to\nintroduce pp. This law is first multiplied by vm and then integrated over the volume V:\nSecs. 2.9 & 2.10\n2.14\n\nvm V\noEdV\nmpfdV + f VmpdV\nV\nV\nV\nere, v is a coordinate (like x,y, or z) perpendicular to the boundary and hence in the direction of n,\ns shown in Fig. 2.10.1.\nFirst, consider the particular case of Eq. 1 with m = 0.

Thus, with volume charges to either side of the interface, there is an\nabrupt change in the rate of change of the electric field intensity normal to the boundary, but the\nfield is itself continuous. On the other hand, as illustrated by the sketches of Fig. 2.10.2b, if\nthere is an appreciable charge per unit area within the boundary, the electric field intensity is\ndiscontinuous, and undergoes a step discontinuity.\nH\na\nw\nc\nT\nc\nSec. 2.10\n2.15\n\nA somewhat less familiar situation is that of Fig. 2.10.2c. Within the boundary there are\nregions of large positive and negative charge concentrations with an associated intense electric field\nbetween. In the limit where the boundary becomes very thin, a component of the surface charge density\nbecomes a doublet, and the electric field becomes an impulse.\nThe double layer can be pictured as being positive surface charges disposed on one side of the\nboundary, and negative surface charges distributed on the other, with an internal component of the\nelectric field originating on the positive charges and terminating on the negative ones. The mag-\nnitude of the double layer is equal to the product of the positive surface charge density and the dis-\ntance between these layers, A. In the limit where the layer thickness becomes infinitely thin while the\ndouble-layer magnitude remains constant, the electric field within the double layer must approach\ninfinity. Thus, associated with the doublet of charge density, there is an impulse in the electric field\nintensity, as sketched in Fig. 2.10.2c.\nThe boundary condition to be used in connection with a double layer is found from Eq. 1 by letting\nm = 1. The left-hand side of Eq. 1 can be integrated by parts, so that it becomes\n(4)\nf V.(EoV\n)dV - f\nE.*VvdV =\nV(pf + p )dV\nV\nV\nV\nFor the incremental volume, the surface double layer density is defined as\np\nlim 1 f v(pf + pp)dV =\nv(p + p )dv\n(5)\nand so the right-hand side of Eq. 4 is ApE. The origin of the A axis remains to be defined but A\nv -v\nTo glean a jump condition from the equation, the second EQS law is incorporated. That I is irrotational,\nEq. 2.3.24a, is represented by defining the electric potential\nE = -VO\n(6)\nThus, the second term on the left in Eq. 4 becomes\nJe E*VvdV\n= -\nVO*VvdV = - f\nV*(OVv)dV + fE V vdV\n(7)\nV\nV\nV\nV\nEvaluation of V2v gives nothing because v is defined as a local Cartesian coordinate. The last inte-\ngral vanishes, and with the application of Gauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, it follows that Eq. 4 becomes\nr\nV-.t da + f e IVv.i da - Ap\n(8)\nSo\nn\no\nn\nA\nS\nS\nProvided that within the layer, E parallel to the interface and Q are finite (not impulses in the limit\nA÷0), Eq. 8 only has contributions to the surface integrals from the regions to either side of the inter-\nface. Thus,\nAEo(vEa -\nv Eb).\n+ Ae 0\n= ApE\n(9)\nThe origin of the v axis is adjusted to make the first term vanish. The required boundary condition\nto be associated with Eqs. 2.3.23a and 2.3.23b is\no II D = EP\n(10)\nThe gradient of Eq. 10 within the plane of the interface converts the jump condition to one in\nterms of the electric field:\nEo a\nID\n- VEZE\n(11)\nHere VE is the surface gradient and t denotes components tangential to the interfacial plane.\nIn the absence of a double-layer surface density, these last two boundary conditions are the\nfamiliar statement that the tangential electric field intensity at a boundary must be continous. The\nstatement given in Eq. 10 that the potential must be continuous at a boundary is another way of stating\nSec. 2.10\n2.16\n\nthis requirement on the tangential electric field intensity. With a double layer, the tangential elec-\nc field intensity is discontinuous, as is also the potential.\nEquations 10 and 11 could also be derived using the condition that the line integral of the electric\neld intensity around a closed loop intersecting the boundary vanish. Usually, the tangential electric\neld is continuous because there is no contribution to this line integral from those segments of the\nntour passing through the boundary. However, with the double layer, the electric field intensity with-\nthe boundary is infinite; so, even though the segments of the line integral across the boundary vanish\nA -\n0, there is a net contribution from these segments of the integration.\nIt is clear that higher order singularities could also be handled by considering values of m in\n1 greater than unity. However, the doublet is as singular a charge distribution as of interest\nysically.\nThere are two reasons for wishing to include the doublet charge distribution, one mathematical and\ne physical. Just as the surface charge density is a singularity in the volume charge density which\nn be used to terminate a normal electric field intensity at a boundary, the double layer is a termination\na tangential electric field. On the physical side, there are many situations in which a double layer\ntually exists within a very thin region of material. Double layers abound at interfaces between liquids\nmetals and between metals. The double-layer concept is useful for modeling electromechanical coupling\nvolving these interfacial regions.\nSo far, those EQS laws have been considered that do not explicitly involve time rates of change.\nnservation of charge does involve a dynamic term. Its associated boundary conditions can therefore\nderived only by making further stipulations as to the nature of the boundary. It is now admitted that\nboundary can, in general, be one which is deforming. Because time did not appear explicitly in the\nevious derivations of this section, the conditions derived are automatically appropriate, even if the\nundary is moving.\nThe integral form of charge conservation, Eq. 2.7.3a, is written for a volume V and surface S\ned to the material itself.\nThus, with _\n+ -,\n( J\n- pf-V)ida = -\np dV\n(12)\nS\nV\nseen in Fig. 2.10.1, the volume of integration always encloses material of fixed identity and inter-\ncts the boundary. Implicit to this statement is the assumption that the boundary is one of demarca-\non between material regions. The material velocity is presumed to at most have a step singularity\nross the boundary.\n(It is important to recognize that there are other types of boundaries. For\nample, the boundary could be a shock front, with a gas moving through from one side of the interface\nthe other. In that case, the boundary conditions thus far derived would remain correct, because no\nntion has yet been made of the physical nature of the boundary.)\nThe left-hand side of Eq. 12 can be handled in a manner similar to that already illustrated, since\ndoes not involve time rates of change. The integration is divided into two parts: one over the upper\nlower surfaces of the volume, the other over the parts of the surface which intersect the boundary.\ne contributions to a current flow through these side surfaces comes from a surface current.\nIt follows\nusing a two-dimensional form of Gauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, that the left-hand side of Eq. 12 is\nf (J - PfV)T. nda + J i\n- Pfy).\nda = A{n.\n- vpf0 + V\nf -\nvt)}\n(13)\nS'+S\"\nS\"'\nre, A is the area of intersection between the volume element and the boundary. The right-hand side of\n. 12 is, by the definition of Eq. 3,\nSjpfdV =~\nafda\n(14)\nV\nA\nte that, if the volume of integration V, and hence the area of integration A, is one always fixed to\nmaterial, then the area A is time-varying. The surface charge density is a function only of the\ndimensions within the plane of the interface. Thus, the term on the right in Eq. 14 is a time\nrivative of a two-dimensional integral. This is a two-dimensional special case of the situation\nscribed by the generalized Leibnitz rule, Eq. 2.6.5, which stated how the time derivative of a volume\ntegral could be represented, even if the volume of integration were time-varying. Thus, Eq. 14 becomes\n=\ndt PfdV\nA [-\n+ V(vt f)\n(15)\n2.1\ntri\nfi\nfi\nco\nin\nas\nEq.\nph\non\nca\nof\nac\nand\nin\nCo\nbe\nthe\npr\nbo\nti\nAs\nse\nti\nac\nex\nto\nme\nit\nand\nTh\nby\nHe\nEq\nNo\nthe\ntwo\nde\nde\nin\n2.17\nSec. 2.10\n\nFinally, with the use of Eqs. 13 and 15, Eq. 12 becomes the required jump condition representing charge\nconservation:\nSJfPfV\n- p\n+ VK f =\nt\n(16)\nBy contrast with Eqs. 10 and 11, the expression is specialized to interfaces that do not support charge\ndistributions so singular as a double layer. In using Eq. 16, note that a partial derivative with\nrespect to time is usually defined as one taken holding the spatial coordinates constant. A review of\nthe derivation of Eq. 16 will make it clear that such is not the significance of the partial derivative\non the right in Eq. 16. The surface charge density is not defined throughout the three-dimensional\nspace. Thus, this derivative means the partial derivative with respect to time, holding the coordinates\nwithin the plane of the interface constant.\nThe component of current normal to the boundary represented by the first term in Eq. 16 will be\nrecognized as the free current density in a frame of reference moving with the boundary. A good questior\nwould be, \"why is it that the normal current density appears in Eq. 16 evaluated in the primed frame of\nreference, while the surface free current density is not?\" The answer points to the physical situation\nfor which Eq. 16 is appropriate. As the material boundary moves in the normal direction, the material\nahead and behind carries a charge distribution along, but one that never reaches the boundary.

Hence, the jump conditions implied by these laws are\nfamiliar from elementary electrodynamics. Ampere's law, Eq. 2.7.1b, is integrated over the surface S\nand around the contour C enclosing the boundary, as sketched in Fig, 2.10.3, to obtain\nS\n= K\n(17)\nwhere Kf is the surface current density. Although it is entirely possible to consider a doublet of\ncurrent density as a model, this impulsive singularity in the distribution of free current density is\nof as high an order as necessary to model MQS electromechanical situations of general interest.\nFrom Gauss' law for magnetic fields, Eq. 2.7.2b,\napplied to the incremental volume enclosing the interface,\nFig. 2.10.1, the jump condition is\n*1\no(H\nW + WIf = 0\n(18)\nFaraday's law of induction brings into play the time\nrate of change, and it is expected that motion of the\nboundary leads to an addition to the jump condition not\nfound for stationary media.

Consistent with Eq. 17 is the assumption\nthat it can be carrying a surface current with it as it deforms.\nIf the surface S were not one of fixed\nidentity, this would mean that the surface integral on the right could be a step function of time as the\nboundary passed through the surface of integration. The result would be a temporal impulse on the right\nwhich would make a contribution to the boundary condition even in the limit where the surface S becomes\nvanishingly small.\nBy contrast, because the surface S is one of fixed identity, in the limit where the\nsurface area vanishes, the right-hand side of Eq. 19 makes no contribution.\nWith the assumption that fields and velocity are at most step functions across the boundary, the\nintegral on the left in Eq. 19 gives\nnix\nl+ v+ x p0DH\n= 0\n(20)\nThis expression is what would be expected, in view of the transformation law for the electric field in\nSec. 2.10\n2.18\n\nthe MQS system.

For the particular cases in which an inductance can be defined, Eq. 3 becomes\nn\ni j=l Lijij, Li j = Li j (-l\"\nm)\n(5)\nThe dynamics of a lumped parameter system arise through Faraday's integral Law of induction,\nEq. 2.7.3b, which can be written for the ith coil as\n2.21\nSec. 2.12\nL\n\nE'*-d\nI=\nBj\nBIda\n(6)\ndt f\nCi\nSi\nHere the contour is one attached to the wire and so v = v in Eq. 2.7.3b.

E\nIt\nd -\nf E '*dk\n+\nE'*dE\nCi\na\nb\nEven though the wire is in general deforming and moving, because it is perfectly conducting, the electric\nfield intensity T' must vanish in the conductor, and so the first integral called for on the right in\nEq. 7 must vanish. By contrast with the EQS fields, the electric field here is not irrotational.\nThis\nmeans that the remaining integration of the electric field intensity between the terminals must be care-\nfully defined. Usually, the terminals are located in a region in which the magnetic field is sufficientl\nsmall to take the electric field intensity as being irrotational, and therefore definable in terms of the\ngradient of the potential. With the assumption that such is the case, the remaining integral of Eq. 7\nis written as\na\na\nt 4\n= -\n.\n= -(,a -\nDb)\n'£\n-vi\n(8)\nb\nb\nThus it follows from Eq. 6, combined with Eqs. 1 and 8, that the voltage at the coil terminals is the\ntime rate of change of the associated flux linked:\ndi\n(9)\nvi\ndt\nWith Xi given by Eq. 3 or Eq. 5, the terminal voltage follows from Eq. 9.\n2.13 Conservation of Electroquasistatic Energy\nThis and the next section develop a field picture of electromagnetic energy storage from fundament\ndefinitions and principles. Results are a first step in the derivation of macroscopic force densities\nin Chap. 3. Energy storage in a conservative EQS system is considered first, followed by a statement\nof power flow. In this and the next section the macroscopic medium is at rest.\nThermodynamics: Whether in electric or magnetic form, energy storage follows from the definition\nof the electric field as a force per unit charge. The work required to transport an element of charge,\n6q, from a reference position to a position p in the presence of the electric field intensity is\n6w= -P\n6qE.di\n(1)\nref\nThe integral is the work done by the external force on the electric subsystem in placing the charge at p\nIf this process can be reversed, it can be said that the work done results in a stored energy equal to\nEq. 1. In an electroquasistatic system, the electric'field is irrotational. Hence,\n-Vt.\nThen, if\nOref is defined as zero, it follows that Eq. 1 becomes\n6w = fP6qVa .P = 6qO\n(2)\nref\nwhere use has been made of the gradient integral theorem, Eq. 2.6.1. Consider now energy storage in\nthe system abstractly represented by Fig. 2.13.1.\nThe system is perfectly insulating, except for the\nperfectly conducting electrodes introduced into the volume of interest, as in Sec. 2.11. It will be\ntermed an \"electroquasistatic thermodynamic subsystem.\"\nThe electrodes have terminal variables as defined in Sec. 2.11; voltages vi and total charges qi.\nBut, in addition, the volume between the electrodes supports a free charge density pf. By definition,\nthe energy stored in assembling these charges is equal to the work required to carry the charges from a\nreference position to the positions of interest. Thus, the incremental energy storage associated with\nincremental changes in the electrode charges, 6qi, or in the charge density, 6Pf, in a given neighbor-\nhood on the insulator, is\ny\nal\n.\nSecs. 2.12 & 2.13\n2.22\n\nth\nlectrodE\nFig. 2.13.1\n--------------\n-\n--\n--------\n-\nSchematic representation\nI - -\n--\n------------------\nof electroquasistatic\n\\\\\n\\\"\n'(\n\\%\n:;;;\nr--\n- --..\n.-\n,Pf)\nsystem composed of per-\nfectly conducting elec-\ntrodes imbedded in a per-\nfectly insulating dielec-\ntric medium.\n----------------------------------------\nn\n= E vi 6qi + J @6\n6w\npfdV\ni=l\nV'\nV1\nThe volume V' is the volume excluded by the electrodes. Note that the reference electrode is not in-\ncluded in the summation, because the electric potential on that electrode is, by definition, zero. The\nwork required to place a free charge at its final position correctly accounts for the polarization,\nbecause the polarization charges induced in carrying the free charges to their final position are re-\nflected in the potential.\nConsider now the field representation of the electroquasistatic stored energy. From Gauss' law\n(Eq. 2.3.23a), the contribution of the summation in Eq. 3 can be represented in terms of an integral\nover the surfaces Si of the electrodes:\nn\n6w = E\n.i6D.nda\n+ f6pfdV\ni=l\ni DJ\nHere, Di is the potential on the surface Si .\nThe surfaces enclosing the electrodes can be joined to-\ngether at infinity, as shown in Fig. 2.13.1. The resulting simply connected surface encloses all of the\nelectrodes, the wires as they extend to infinity, with the surface completed by a closure at infinity.\nThus, the surface integration called for with the first term on the right in Eq. 4 can be represented\nby an integration over a closed surface. Gauss' theorem is then used to convert this surface integral\nto a volume integration. However, note that the normal vector used in Eq. 4 points into the volume V'\nexcluded by the electrodes and included by the surface at infinity. Thus, in using Gauss' theorem,\na minus sign is introduced and Eq. 4 becomes\n6w = - J V* (6'D)dV + J c6pfdV = f [-WV.6D - 6D-VO + 06pf]dV\nV'\nVI\nV'\nIn rewriting the integral, the identity V*.C = C.VQ + yV-V has been used.\nFrom Gauss' law, 6pf = 6V.D = V*6D.\nIt follows that the first and last terms in Eq. 5 cancel.\nAlso, the electric field is irrotational (\n= -VW).\nSo Eq. 5 becomes\n6w =\nE.6DdV\nV\nThere is no E inside the electrodes, so the integration is now over all of the volume V.\nThe integrand in Eq. 6 is an energy density, and it is therefore appropriate to define the in-\ncremental change in electric energy density as\n6W = E*D\n2.23\nSec. 2.13\n\nThe field representation of the energy, as given by Eqs. 6 and 7, should be compared to that for\nlumped parameters. Suppose all of the charge resided on electrodes. Then, the second term in Eq. 3\nwould be zero, and the incremental change in energy would be given by the first term:\nn\n6w = E vijqi\nComparison of Eqs. 6 and 8 suggests that the electric field plays a role analogous to the terminal voltage,\nwhile the displacement vector is the analog of the charge on the electrodes. If the relationship between\nthe variables P and t, or v and q, is single-valued, then the energy density and the total energy in the\ncontinuum and lumped parameter systems can be viewed, respectively, as integrals or areas under curves\nas sketched in Fig. 2.13.2.\nIf it is more convenient to have all of the voltages,\nrather than the charges, as independent variables, then\nLegendre's dual transformation can be used.

Geometric representation\nThe coenergy and coenergy density functions have\nof energy w, coenergy w', energy\nthe geometric relationship to the energy and energy den-\ndensity W, and coenergy density W'\nsity functions, respectively, sketched in Fig. 2.13.2.\nfor electric field systems.\nIn those systems in which there is no distribution of\ncharge other than on perfectly conducting electrodes,\nEqs. 6 and 8 can be regarded as equivalent ways of computing the same incremental change in electro-\nquasistatic energy. If the charge is distributed throughout the volume, Eq. 6 remains valid.\nWith the notion of electrical energy storage goes the concept of a conservative subsystem. In\nthe process of building up free charges on perfectly conducting electrodes or slowly conducting charge\nto the bulk positions (one mechanism for carrying out the process pictured abstractly by Eq. 3), the\nwork is stored much as it would be in cocking a spring. The electrical energy, like that of the spring,\ncan later be released (discharged). Included in the subsystem is storage in the polarization. For\nwork done on polarizable entities to be stored, this polarization process must also be reversible. Here,\nit is profitable to think of the dipoles as internally constrained by spring-like nondissipative\nelements, capable of releasing energy when the polarizing field is turned off. Mathematically, this\nrestriction on the nature of the polarization is brought in by requiring that y and hence y be a single-\nvalued function of the instantaneous g, or that e = 2($). In lumped parameter systems, this is tanta-\nmount to q = q(v) or v = v(q).\nPower Flow: The electric and polarization energy storage subsystem is the field theory generaliza-\ntion of a capacitor. Just as practical circuits involve a capacitor interconnected with resistors\nand other types of elements, in any actual physical system the ideal energy storage subsystem is im-\nbedded with and coupled to other subsystems. The field equations, like Kirchhoff's laws in circuit\ntheory, encompass all of these subsystems. The following discussion is based on forming quadratic\nexpressions from the field laws, and hence relate to the energy balance between subsystems.\nFor a geometrical part of the ith subsystem, having the volume V enclosed by the surface S, a\nstatement of power flow takes the integral form\nat\niin)da +\ni- dV =V idV\n(12)\nS\nV\nSec. 2.13\n2.24\n\nHere, Si is the power flux density, Wi is the energy density, and *i is the dissipation density.\nDifferent subsystems can occupy the same volume V. In Eq. 12, V is arbitrary, while i distinguishes\nthe particular physical processes considered. The differential form of Eq. 12 follows by applying Gauss'\ntheorem to the first term and (because V is arbitrary) setting the integrand to zero:\naw\nSi +at\ni\n(13)\nThis is a canonical form which will be used to describe various subsystems. In a given region, Wi can\nincrease with time either because of the volumetric source #i or because of a power flux -§:'i into the\nregion across its bordering surfaces.\nFor an electrical lumped parameter terminal pair, power is the product of voltage and current. This\nserves as a clue for finding a statement of power flow from the basic laws.\nThe generalization of the\nvoltage is the potential, while conservation of charge as expressed by Eq. 2.3.25a brings in the free\ncurrent density. So, the sum of Eqs. 2.3.25a and the conservation of polarization charge equation,\nEq. 2.8. 5, is multiplied by 0 to obtain\n[V. (f+J\n+\n(p + pp)] = 0\n(14)\nWith the objective an expression having the form of Eq. 13, a vector identity (Eq. 15, Appendix B)\nand Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a, convert Eq. 14 to\nV. [ (J + J )] + E.

Note that We does not include energy stored by polarizing the medium. Also, it can\nbe shown that V.Se = V.(1 x f), so that 1e is the poynting vector familiar from conventional classical\nelectrodynamics. In the dissipation density, I-.f can represent work done on an external mechanical\nsystem due to polarization forces or, if the polarization process involves dissipation, heat energy\ngiven up to a thermal subsystem.\nThe polarization terms in Oe can also represent energy storage in the polarization. This is illus-\ntrated by specializing Eq. 16 to describe a subsystem in which - is a single-valued function of the\ninstantaneous -, the free current density is purely ohmic, f = at, and the medium is at rest. Then, the\npolarization term from 4e can be lumped with the energy density term to describe power flow in a subsystem\nthat includes energy storage in the polarization:\nawE\nV.E + at\nE\n(17)\nwhere\nS\nQ\n+ aD\nWE\nEE\nEE\no\n2.25\nSec. 2.13\n\nNote that the integral defining the energy density WE, which is consistent with Eq. 7, involves an int\ngrand t which is time dependent only through the time dependence of 8: 1 = '[f(t)].\nThus, aWE/at =\nE.(-/at).\nWith the power flux density placed on the right, Eq. 17 states that the energy density decreases\nbecause of electrical losses (note that *E < 0) and because of the divergence of the power density.\n2.14\nConservation of Magnetoquasistatic Energy\nFundamentally, the energy stored in a magnetic field involves the same work done by moving a tes\ncharge from a reference position to the position of interest as was the starting point in Sec. 2.13.\nBut, the same starting point leads to an entirely different form of energy storage. In a magnetoquasi\nstatic system, the net free charge is a quantity evaluated after the fact. A self-consistent represe\ntion of the fields is built upon a statement of current continuity, Eq. 2.3.26b, in which the free\ncharge density is ignored altogether. Yet, the energy stored in a magnetic field is energy stored in\ncharges transported against an electric field intensity. The apparent discrepancy in these statement\nresolved by recognizing that the charges of interest in a magnetoquasistatic system are at least of\ntwo species, with the charge density of one species alone far outweighing the net charge density.\nThermodynamics: Because the free current density is solenoidal, a current \"tube\" can be defined\nshown in Fig. 2.14.1. This tube is defined with a cross section having a normal yn in the direction\nthe local current density, and a surrounding surface having a normal perpendicular to the local curre\ndensity. An example of a current tube is a wire surrounded by insulation and hence carrying a total\nrent i which is the same at one cross section as at another.\nFig. 2.14.1\nCurrent tube defined as having\ncross-sectional area ds per-\nt\nthe\nto\npendicular\ndensity, and an outside surface\nwith a normal vector perpendicular\nto the current density.\ni\nFor bipolar conduction, and a stationary medium, the current density within the tube is related\nto the charge density by the expression\n4.\nJf = pv+ - pv_\n(1)\nHere the conduction process is visualized as involving two types of carriers, one positive, with a ch\ndensity p+, and the other negative, with a magnitude p-. The carriers then have velocities which are\nrespectively, v+ and\n_..\nEven though there is a current density, in the magnetoquasistatic system th\nis essentially no net charge: pf = p+ -\np- = 0. In an increment of time 6t, the product of the respe\ncharge densities and net displacements is p+v+6t and - p.0.6t. The work done on the charges as they\nundergo these displacements is the energy stored in magnetic form. This work is computed by recogniz\nthat the force on each of the charged species is the product of the charge density and the electric\nfield intensity. Hence, the energy stored in the field by a length of the current tube d£ is to fir\norder in differentials dt and ds,\n-(pv\n-p_v\n).E6tdsdi = -Jf *E6tdsdk\n(2)\nThe expression for the free current density, Eg. i, is used on the right to restate the energy stored\nin the increment of time 6t.\nThe unit vector In is defined to be the direction of if. Thus, If =\nCf('n)tn. Because the current density is solenoidal, it follows closed paths. The product If.tnds\nis, by definition, constant along one of these paths, and if Indi is defined as an increment of the\nline integral, it then follows from Eq. 2 that the energy stored in a single current tube is\n(3)\nd(\nC\nSecs. 2.13 & 2.14\n2.26\ne-\nt\n-\nnta-\ns is\nas\nof\nnt\ncur-\narge\n,\nere\nctive\ning\nst\n\nFig. 2.14.2\nXi\nSchematic representation of\na magnetoquasistatic energy\nstorage system. Currents\nare either distributed in\ncurrent loops throughout the\nvolume of interest, or con-\nfined to one of n possible\ncontours connected to the\ndiscrete terminal pairs.\nBy contrast with the electroquasistatic system, in which the electric field intensity is induced\nby the charge density (Gauss' law), the electric field intensity in Eq. 3 is clearly rotational. This\nemphasizes the essential role played by Faraday's law of magnetic induction.\nIt is helpful to have in mind at least the abstraction of a physical system. Figure 2.14.2 shows\na volume of interest in which the currents are either distributed throughout the volume or confined to\nparticular contours (coils), the latter case having been discussed in Sec. 2.12.\nFirst, consider the energy stored in the current paths defined by coils having cross-sectional\narea ds. From Eq. 3, this contribution to the total energy is conveniently written as\n-* .nds(\nE.ndG)6t =\nXi\n(4)\nC.\nFaraday's law and the definition of flux linkage, Eqs. 2.12.1 and 2.12.6, are the basis for representing\nthe line integral as a change in the flux linkage.\nBecause the free current density is solenoidal, the distribution of free currents within the\nvolume V excluded by the discrete coils can be represented as the superposition of current tubes. From\nEq. 4 and the integral form of Faraday's law, Eq. 2.7.3b with vs = v = 0 (the medium is fixed), it\nfollows that the energy stored in a current tube is\nSwcurrent tube = Jf\" ndS (\nA.-da)\n(5)\nStube\nThe magnetic flux density is also solenoidal4 and fog this reason it is convenient to introduce the mag-\nnetic vector potential A, defined such that B = V x A, so that the magnetic flux density is automatically\nsolenoidal. With this representation of the flux density in terms of the vector potential, Stokes's\ntheorem, Eq. 2.6.3, converts Eq. 5 to\nJf.*ds r r 6~A.ld=\n(\n.6A)dsdk =\nJ f.dAdV\n(6)\nCtube\nCtube\nVtube\nHere, f is by definition in the direction of tn, so that Jf.61 takes the component of 61 in the tn direc-\ntion. The second equality is based upon recognition that the product as-It is a volume element of the\ncurrent tube, and the line integration constitutes an integration over the volume, Vtube , of the tube.\nTo include all of the energy stored in the distributed current loops, it is necessary only that\n2.27\nSec. 2.14\n\nthe integral on the right in Eq. 6 be extended over all of the volume occupied by the tubes.\nThe combi\ntion of the incremental energy stored in the discrete loops, Eq. 4, and that from the distributed curre\nloops, Eq. 6, is the incremental total energy of the system\nn\n6w = E\nii\ni +\n.6AdV\n(7)\ni=l i\nIn this expression, V is the volume excluded by the discrete current paths.\nThis incremental magnetic\nenergy storage is analogous to that for the electric field storage represented by Eq, 2.13.3.\nIn retrospect, it is apparent from the derivation that the division into discrete and distributed\ncurrent paths, represented by the two terms in Eq. 7, is a matter of convenience. In representing the\nincremental energy in terms of the magnetic fields alone, it is handy to extend the volume V over all\nof the currents within the volume of interest, including those that might be represented by discrete\nterminal pairs. With this understanding, the incremental change in energy, Eq. 7, is the last term\nonly, with V extended over the total volume. Moreover, Ampere's law represents the current density in\nterms of the magnetic field intensity, and, in turn, the integrand can be rewritten by use of a vector\nidentity (Eq. 8, Appendix B):\n6w =\nV x H.6~dV =\n[H.V x\nA + V.(H x 6iA)]dV\n(8)\nV\nV\nThe last term in Eq. 8 can be converted to a surface integral by using Gauss' theorem. With the\nunderstanding that the system is closed in the sense that the fields fall off rapidly enough at infinit\nso that the surface integration can be ignored, the remaining volume integration on the right in Eq. 8\ncan be used to obtain a field representation of the incremental energy change. With the curl of the\nvector potential converted back to a flux density, Eq. 8 becomes\nw =\nHHf Bdv\n(9)\nV\nThe integrand of Eq. 9 is defined as an incremental magnetic energy density\n6W = H.6B\n(10)\nIt is helpful to note the clear analogy between this energy density and the incremental total energy\nrepresented by lumped parameters.\nIn the absence of volume free current densities that cannot be\nrepresented by discrete terminal pairs, Eq. 7 reduces to the lumped parameter form\nn\n6w =\nE\ni.6X.\n(11)\ni=l\nThe magnetic field intensity plays the continuum role of the discrete terminal currents, and the magnet\nflux density is the continuum analog of the lumped parameter flux linkages.\nThe situation in this mag-\nnetic case is, of course, analogous to the electrical incremental energy storages in continuum and in\nlumped parameter cases, as discussed with Eqs. 7 and 8 of Sec. 2.13.\nJust as it is often convenient in dealing with electrical lumped parameters to use the voltage\nas an independent variable, so also in magnetic field systems it is helpful to use the terminal current\nas independent variables. In that case, the coenergy function w' is conveniently introduced as an\nenergy function\nn\n6w' = Z X.6i.\n(12)\ni=l\nIn an analogous way, the co-energy density, w', is defined such that\n6W' = B.6H; W' = H.B - W\n(13)\nPower Flow:\nThus far, the storage of energy in magnetic form has been examined. The postulate\nhas been that all work done in moving the charges against an electric field is stored.\nIn any system\nas a whole this is not likely to be the case.\nThe general magnetoquasistatic laws enable a deduction\nof an equation representing the flow of power, and the rate of change of the stored energy. This plac\nSdc. 2.14\n2.28\nna-\nnt\ny\nic\ns\nes\n\nthe energy storage in the context of a more general system.\nA clue as to how an energy conservation statement might be constructed from the differential mag-\nnetoquasistatic laws is obtained from Eq. 2, which makes it clear that the product of the free current\ndensity and the electric field intensity are closely connected with the statement of conservation of\nenergy. The dot product of the electric field and Ampere's law, Eq. 2.3.23b, is\nE.[V x H -\nJf] - 0\n(14)\nUse of a vector identity 6Eq. 8, Appendix B) makes it possible to rewrite this expression as\n+ H.V\n4.\n4.\n4.\n4. 4.\nx E -\nV.(E x H) = E.Jf\n(15)\nWith the additional use of Faraday's law to represent V x E, Eq. 15 takes the form of Eq. 2.13.16, with\nS EExH\ne\n4.\nWe -\nH\n(16)\n4+\n.+\n4.\no\n+\n-E.J - H.\n-\n.\nx ( Mx\n)\nThese quantities have much the same physical significances discussed in connection with Eq. 2.13.16.\nTo place the magnetic energy storage identified with the thermodynamic arguments in the context of\nan actual system, consider a material which is ohmic and fixed so that 4 = 0 and If = C1. Then the\nsecond term on the right in Eq. 16c is in the form of a time rate of change of magnetization energy\ndensity. Hence, the power flow equation assumes the form of Eq. 2.13.17, with\nWE=\nH*6B\n(17)\no\n=\nSE\n-QE*E\nImplicit is the assumption that H is a single-valued function of the instantaneous B.\nThe resulting\nenergy density includes magnetization energy and is consistent with Eq. 2.14.10.\n2.15 Complex Amplitudes; Fourier. Amplitudes and Fourier Transforms\nThe notion of a continuum network fs introduced for the first time in the next section. The associ-\nated transfer relations illustrated there are a theme throughout the chapters which follow. Among several\nreasons for their use is the organization they lend to the representation of complicated, largely linear,\nsystems. In this chapter, the continuum networks represent electromagnetic fields. Later, they re-\npresent fluid and (to some degree) solid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and electromechanical continua\nin general. These networks make it possible to set aside one part of a given problem, derive the associ-\nated relations once and for all and accumulate these for later use. Such relations will be picked up over\nand over in solving different problems and, properly understood, are a useful reference.\nComplex Amplitudes:\nIn many practical situations, excitations are periodic in one or two spatial\ndirections, in time or in space and time. The complex amplitude representation of fields, useful in\ndealing with these situations, is illustrated by considering the function O(z,t) which has dependence\non z given explicitly by\nO(z,t) = Re y ( t ) e - j k z\n(1)\nWith the wavenumber k real, the spatial distribution is periodic with wavelength X = 2wr/k and spatial\nphase determined by the complex amplitude 1. For example, if\n= y o(t) is real and k is real, then\nO(z,t) =\no0\n0 (t) cos kz.\nThe spatial derivative of 0 follows from Eq. 1 as\nS Re\n(t)e-jkz\n(2)\n7z\nRe.[-JkZ(t)e\n(2\n2.29\nSecs. 2.14 & 2.15\n\nThe following identifications can therefore be made:\nas\nwith it being understood that even though complex amplitudes are being used, the temporal dependence is\narbitrary. There will be occasions where the time dependence is specified, but the space dependence is\nnot.\nFor example, complex amplitudes will take the form\nQ(z,t) = Re4(z)e j wt\n(4)\nwhere D(z) is itself perhaps expressed as a Fourier series or transform (see Sec. 5.16).\nMost.often, complex amplitudes will be used to represent both temporal gnd spatial dependences:\nD(z,t) = Recej(Wt-kz)\n(5)\nThe (angular) frequency w can in general be complex. If 0 is periodic in time with period T, then T =\n2n/w. For complex amplitudes 0, the identifications are:\n[4(z,t),\n(z,t),\n(z,t)]<>[$,-jk(,jj]\n(6)\nIf w and k are real, Eq. 5 represents a traveling wave. At any instant, its wavelength is 2w/k,\nat any position its frequency is w and points of constant phase propagate in the +z direction with the\nphase velocity w/k.\nFourier Amplitudes and Transforms: The relations between complex amplitudes are identical to those\nbetween Fourier amplitudes or between Fourier transforms provided that these are suitably defined. For\na wide range of physical situations it is the spatially periodic response or the temporal sinusoidal\nsteady state that is of interest. Simple combinations of solutions represented by the complex amplitudes\nthen suffice, and there is no need to introduce Fourier concepts. Even so, it is important to recognize\nat the outset that the spatial information required for analysis of excitations with arbitrary spatial\ndistributions is inherent to the transfer relations based on single-complex-amplitude solutions.\nThe Fourier series represents an arbitrary function periodic in z with fundameqtal periodicity\nlength k by a superposition of complex exponentials.\nIn terms of complex Fourier coefficients $n(t),\nsuch a series is\nn z\n-jk\nQ(z,t) =\nE\n(t)e\nk\n2nI/R; Q*\nn\n=\n(7)\nn\nn\nn\n-n\nwhere the condition on n insures that 0 is real. Thus, with the identification\n+ 4n\nn and k + kn, each\ncomplex exponential solution of the form of Eq. 1 can be taken as one term in the Fourier series.\nThe\nmth Fourier amplitude Om follows by multiplying Eq. 7 by the complex conjugate function exp(jkmz) and.\nintegrating over the length k to obtain only one term on the right. This expression can then be solved\nfor ym to obtain the inverse relation\nz+\nJkmz\nim\nO\nQ (z,t)e\ndz\n(8)\nz\nIf the temporal dependence is also periodic, with fundamental period T, the Fourier series can also\nbe used to represent the time dependence in Eq. 7:\n+i\n+o\nJ wmt-knz)\nO(z,t)=\nE\nE\ne\n;\n*\n= 8\n(9)\nmn\nmn\n-m-n\nm=--\nn=--\nwhere the condition on the amplitudes insures that O(z,t) is real. One component out of this double sum-\nmation is the traveling-wave solution represented by the complex amplitude form, Eq. 5. The rules given\nby Eqs. 3 and 6 pertain either to the complex amplitudes or the Fourier coefficients.\nThe Fourier transform is convenient if the dependence is not periodic.

Recall that fvdu = uv - fudv and identify\ndu -+ O/azdz and v -\nexp jkz, and it follows that\nS-\nkz dz =\nejk-C -jk +\nejkz dz\n(12)\nFor properly bounded functions the first term on the right vanishes and the second is -jki(k,t).\nThe\ntransform of Ha/Dz is simply -jkl and thus the Fourier transform also follows the rules given with\nEq. 3.\nExtension of the Fourier transform to a second dimension results in the transform pair\nj(ot-ks) dk dw\n0(z,t) =\n0 $(k, w)e J(t-kz)\n2dk\nd2w\n(13)\nA\n= +|\nJ(k,w)\nf\n(z,t)e -j\n- j (,t-kz)\n(tkz)dt dt dz\ndz\nwhich illustrates how the traveling-wave solution of Eq. 5 can be viewed as a component of a complicated\nfunction. Again, relations between complex amplitudes are governed by the same rules, Eq. 6, as are the\nFourier amplitudes $(k,w).\nIf relationships are found among quantities $(t), then the same relations hold with c + $ and\nD( )/Bt -÷ jw, because the time dependence exp(jwt)is a particular case of the more general form $(t).\nAverages of Periodic Functions: An identity often used to evaluate temporal or spatial averages of\ncomplex-amplitude expressions is\nRe\nekz Re Bej\n= 1 Re A B*\n(14)\n/z\nwhere ( )z\nsignifies an average over the length 2w/k and it is assumed that k is real.

Surfaces enclosing these regions are often planar, cylindrical or\nspherical, with the volume then taking the form of a planar layer, a cylindrical annulus or a spherical\nshell. Such volumes and bounding surfaces are illustrated in Tables 2.16.1-3. The question answered\nin this section is: given the potential on the bounding surfaces, what are the associated normal flux\ndensities? Of immediate interest is the relation of the electric potentials to the normal displace-\nment vectors. But also treated in this section is the relation of the magnetic potential to the normal\nmagnetic flux densities. First the electroquasistatic fields are considered, and then the magnetoquasi\nstatic relations follow by analogy.\nElectric Fields:\nIf any one of the regions shown in Tables 2.16.1-3 is filled with insulating\ncharge-free (pf\nO) material of uniform permittivity e,\nS(-\n)E,\nD =\nE\n(1)\nthe governing field equations are Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a,\nV*D = 0\n(2)\nand the condition that E be irrotational, Eq. 2.3.24a. The latter is equivalent to\nE = -V0\n(3)\nThus, the potential distribution within a volume is described by Laplace's equation\nV20 = 0\n(4)\nIn terms of 4,\nD = -eVO\n(5)\nMagnetic Fields:\nFor magnetoquasistatic fields in an insulating region (Jf = 0) of uniform per-\nmeability\nM= (I-- 1)Hi;.B =pH\n(6)\nThus, from Ampere's law, Eq. 2.3.23b, H is irrotational and it is appropriate to define a magnetic\npotential Y:\nH = -V_\n(7)\nIn addition. there is Eq. 2.3.24b:\nV.B = 0\n(8)\nThus, the potential again satisfies Laplace's equation\nv2y = 0\n(9)\nand in terms of ', the magnetic flux density is\nB = -1VW\n(10)\nComparison of the last two relations to Eqs. 4 and 5 shows that relations now derived for the\nelectric fields can be carried over to describe the magnetic fields by making the identification\nPlanar Layer:\nBounding surfaces at x = A and x = 0, respectively denoted by a and 0, are shown\nin Table 2.16.1. So far as developments in this section are concerned, these are not physical boundar\nThey are simply surfaces at which the potentials are respectively\n4(A,y,z,t) = Re g\n(t)exp[-j(k y+k z)]; D(0,y,z,t) = Re I 0(t)exp[-j(k y+kzz)]\n(11)\nt\ny( zy\ny\n-\nies\nSecs. 2.15 & 2.16\n2.32\n\nTable 2.16.1. Flux-potential -transfer relations for planar layer in terms of electric\npotential and normal displacement (0,Dx). To obtain magnetic relations,\nsubstitute (Q,Dx,) +e ('Y,.B,).\nThese will be recognized as generalizations of the complex amplitudes introduced with Eq. 2.15.1. That\nthe potentials at the a and $ surfaces can be quite general follows from the discussion of Sec. 2.15,\nwhich shows that the following arguments apply when I is a spatial Fourier amplitude or a Fourier trans-\nform.\nIn view of the surface potential distributions, solutions to Eq. 4 are assumed to take the form\nS=-\nRe O(x,t) exp[-j(kyy + kzz)]\n(12)\nSubstitution shows that\nd2\n2 = 0; y =Vk2 + k2\n(13)\ndx2\ny\nz\n+yx\nSolutions of this equation are linear combinations of e\nor alternatively of sinh yx and cosh yx.\nWith ~i and 12 arbitrary functions of time, the solution teakes the form\n$1 sinh yx + 02 cosh yx\n(14)\nThe two coefficients are determined by requiring that the conditions of Eq. 11 be satisfied. For the sim-\nple situation at hand, an instructive alternative to performing the algebra necessary to evaluate (01,02)\nconsists in recognizing that a linear combination of the two solutions in Eq. 14 is sinh y(x - A).\nThus,\nthe solution can be written as the sum of solutions that are individually zero on one or the other of the\nbounding surfaces. By inspection, it follows that\na- sinh.yx _ .; sinh y(x - A)\n(15)\nsinh yA\nsinh yA\nFrom Eqs. 5 and 15,\ncan be determined:\n-e\nRe\na cosh yx -B\ncosh y(x-A)\n- (ky + kz)\n(16)\nx\nax\nRy\nsinh yA\nsinh yA\nEvaluation of this equation at x -\nA gives the displacement vector normal to the a surface, with complex\namplitude ED. Similarly, evaluated at x = 0, Eq. 16\nives D5. The components of the \"flux\" (Nij ) are\nnow determined, given the respective potentials (ci ,B).\nThe transfer relations, Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1,\nsummarize what is found. These relations can be solved for any pair of variables as a function of the\nremaining pair. The inverse transfer relations are also summarized for reference in Table 2.16.1, Eq. (b)\nSec. 2.16\nI\n2.33\n\nI\nx\n)\"A=.5\nV\nYA= 2\n&8\nYA=5 V\nYA-\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 2.16.1.\n(a) Transfer coefficients as a function of Ay EA\nk2 + k2\n(b) Distribution of 0 across layer.\nThat the layer is essentially a distributed capacitance (inductance) is emphasized by drawing\nattention to the analogy between the transfer relations and constitutive laws for a system of linear\ncapacitors (inductors). For a two-terminal-pair system, Eq. 2.11.5 comprises two terminal char es\n(ql,q2) expressed as linear functions of the terminal voltages (vl,V2). Analogously, the (D,,Dx)\n(which have units of charge per unit area and an arbitrary time dependence) are given as linear func-\ntions of the potentials by Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1. A similar analogy exists between Eq. 2.12.5,\nexpressing (X1 ,X2 ) as functions of (il,i 2), and the transfer relations between (B ,BO) (units of flux\nper unit area) and the magnetic potentials (TYa,P).\nAccording to Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1, Dx is induced by a \"self term\" (proportional to the potentia\nat the same surface) and a \"mutual term.\"\nThe coefficients which express this self- and mutual-coupling\nhave a dependence on ay (2r/y the wavelength in the y-z plane) shown in Fig. 2.16.1a. Written in the\nform of Eq. 15, the potential has components, excited at each surface, that decay to zero, as shown in\nFig. 2.16.1b, at a rate that is proportional to how rapidly the fields vary in the y-z plane. For long\nwaves the decay is relatively slow, as depicted by the case Ay = 0.5, and the mutual-field is almost as\ngreat as the self field. But as the wavelength is shortened relative to A (Ay increased), the surfaces\ncouple less and less.\nIn this discussion it is assumed that y is real, which it is if ky and kz are real.\nIn fact, the\ntransfer relations are valid and useful for complex values of (ky,kz).\nIf these numbers are purely\nimaginary, the field distributions over the layer cross section are periodic. Such solutions are needed\nto satisfy boundary conditions imposed in an x-y plane.\nCylindrical Annulus: With the bounding surfaces coaxial cylinders having radii a and B, it is\nnatural to use cylindrical coordinates (r, 0, z).\nA cross section of this prototype region and the\ncoordinates are shown in Table 2.16.2.\nOn the outer and inner surfaces, the potential has the respec\ntive forms\no(a,e,z,t)\nRe\n(t) e-\ne\n=\nP\nj(m +kz);\n0(B,0,z,t) = Re ~ (t)e-j(me+kz)\n(17)\nHence, it is appropriate to assume a bulk potential\n( = Re y(r,t)e -j(me+kz)\n(18)\nSubstitution in Laplace's equation (see Appendix A for operations in cylindrical coordinates), Eq. 4,\nthen shows that\nd\n1 d@\nm\n(19)\n2 + -\n-)\n-\n(k\n+\n(19)\ndr\nr dr\ndr\nr\nBy contrast with Eq. 13, this one has space-varying coefficients.\nIt is convenient to categorize the\nsolutions according to the values of (m,k).

Note that Im and Km are respectively\nsingular at infinity and the origin.\nJust as the exponential solutions could be determined from Eq. 13 by assuming a power series in x,\nthe Bessel functions are determined from an infinite series solution to Eq. 19. Like y, k can in general\nbe complex. If it is, it is customary to define two new functions which, in the special case where k\nis real, have imaginary arguments:\nJm(Jkr)\nj m\nm\nI m (kr), H m (jkr)\n7r j-(m\nKl)\nm (kr)\n(22)\nThese are respectively the Bessel and Hankel functions of first kind.

The resulting transfer relations are summarized by\nEq. (a) in Table 2.16.2. Inversion of these relations, to give the surface potentials as functions of\nthe surface displacements, results in the relations summarized by Eq. (b) of that table. Primes denote\nderivatives with respect to the entire specified argument of the function.

The self-field coefficients fm(O,a) and fm(o,8) are sketched for m=0O and m=l in\nFig. 2.16.2b.

In terms of the\nLegendre polynomials Pn, these functions are summarized in Table 2.16.3. Note that these solutions are\nclosed. They do not require infinite series for their representation.\nTo the second order differential equation, Eq. 33, there must be a second set of solutions Q.\nBecause these are singular in the interval 0 4 e < 7 , and situations of interest here include the\nentire spherical surface at any given radius, these solutions are not included. The functions Pm play\nthe role of exp(jkz)(say) in cylindrical geometry, while exp(jmo) is analogous to exp(jmO).\nThe radial\ndependence, which is much of the bother in cylindrical coordinates, is actually quite simple in spherica\ncoordinates. From Eq. 31b it is seen that solutions are a linear combination of rn and r-(n+l).

The horizontal register of each diagram is\ndetermined by the complex amplitude, which determines the phase of exp(jmo).\nEvaluation of the transfer relations given in Table 2.16.3 by Eqs. (a) and (b) is now carried out\nfollowing the same procedure as for the planar layer. From these relations follow the limiting situ-\nations of a solid spherical region or one where the outer surface is well removed from the region of\ninterest summarized for reference by Eqs.

Then, Eq. 4 takes the form\n6w = C[-a a\n&o + a-n nD)-\n(7)\nn\nn\n/\nwhere C is 1/2 in the Cartesian and cylindrical cases and is a positive constant in the spherical\ncase.\nWith the assumption that w = w(Da,D ), the incremental energy can also be written as\n6w =\n6w a a +w\nB\n(8)\naDa\nn\nS\nn\nn\nn\nwhere (Mn,aB)\nconstitute independent electrical \"terminal\" variables.

Not only does this reduce the vector field to a scalar field, but the potential function\nevaluated on such surfaces as those of \"perfectly\" conducting electrodes becomes a lumped parameter\nterminal variable, e.g., the voltage.\nSolenoidal fields, such as the magnetic flux density B, are for similar reasons sometimes re-\npresented in terms of a vector potential A:\n+\n+\nThus, B automatically has no divergence. Unfortunately, the vector field B is represented in terms of\nanother vectox field A. However, for important two-dimensional or symmetric configurations, a single\ncomponent of A is all required to again reduce the description to one involving a scalar function.\nFour commonly encountered cases are summarized in-Table 2.18.1.\nThe first two are two-dimensional in the usual sense. The field B lies in the x-y (or r-8) plane\nand depends only on these coordinates. The associated vector potential has only a z component. The\nthird configuration, l1ke the second, is in cylindrical geometry, but with B independent of e and hence\nwith A having only an i0 component. The fourth configuration is in spherical geometry with symmetry\nabout the z axis and the vector potential directed along 0..\nLike the scalar potential used to represent irrotational fields, the vector potential is closely\nrelated to lumped parameter variables. If B is the magnetic flux density, i4 is convenient for evalua-\ntion of tje flux linkage X (Eq. 2.12.1).\nFor an incompressible flow, where B is replaced by the fluid\nvelocity v, the vector potential is conveniently used to evaluate the volume rate of flow. In that\napplication, A and A become \"stream functions.\"\nThe connection between the flux linked and the vector potential follows from Stokes's theorem,\nEq. 2.6.3. The flux 1X through a surface S enclosed by a contour C is\n0= f 1da\na =\nV x -tnda\n=\n1d-\n(2)\nS\nS\nC\nIn each of the configurations of Table 2.18.1, Eq. 2 amounts to an evaluation of the surface integral.\nFor example, in the Cartesian two-dimensional configuration, contributions to the integration around a\ncontour C enclosing a surface having length 2 in the z direction, only come from the legs running in\nthe a direction. Along these portions of the contour, denoted by (a) and (b), the coordinates (x,y) are\nconstant. Hence, the flux through the surface is simply 2 times the difference A(a) - A(b), as sum-\nmarized in Table 2.18.1.\nIn the axisymmetric cylindrical and spherical configurations, r and r sin 6 dependences are\nrespectively introduced, so that evaluation of A essentially gives the flux linked. For example, in\nthe spherical configuration, the flux linked by a surface having inner and outer radii r cos 0 evaluate\nat (a) and (b) is simply\nSA(,r\nsin e\n.d=\nr sin e 2(r\nsin e)b = 2rI[A(a) -\nA(b)]\n(3)\nC\nUsed in fluid mechanics to represent incompressible fluid flow, A is the Stokel's stream function. Not\nthat the flux is positive if directed through the surface in the direction of n, which is specified in\nterms of the contour C by the right-hand rule.\n2.19 Vector Potential Transfer Relations for Certain Laplacian Fields\nEven in dealing with magnetic fields in regions where Jf = 0, if the flux linkages are of interest\nit is often more convenient to develop a model in terms of transfer relations specified in terms of a\nvector rather than scalar potential.

The z component of the vector Laplacian is the same operator as for the\nscalar Laplacian. Thus, the situation is analogous to that outlined by Eqs. 2.16.11 to 2.16.16 with\n0 -\nA.

By\nappropriate identification of variables, the same relations can be used to describe different regions.\nAs an example, three planar regions are shown in\nFig. 2.20.1. The symbols in parentheses denote positions\nadjacent to the surfaces demarking subregions. At the\nsurfaces, variables can be discontinuous. Hence it is\nnecessary to distinguish variables evaluated on adjacent\nsides of a boundary. The transfer relations describe\nthe fields within the subregions and not across the\nboundaries.\nThe transfer relations of Table 2.16.1 can be\napplied to the upper region by identifying (a) + (d),\n(0) + (e), A + a and s or P -\nEa or Pa.

Once the surface variables have\nbeen self-consistently determined, the field distributions within the region can be evaluated using th\nbulk distributions evaluated in terms of the surface coefficients. With appropriate surface amplitude\nand x + x', where the latter is defined for each region in Fig. 2.20.1, Eq. 2.16.15 describes the\npotential distribution.\nThis approach will be used not only in other geometries but in representing mechanical and\nelectromechanical processes.\nSec. 2.20\n2.46\ne\ns"

Rationalized MKS units are used not only\nin connection with electrodynamics, but also in dealing with subjects such as fluid mechanics and heat\ntransfer, which are often treated in English units. Unless otherwise given, basic units of meters (m),\nkilograms (kg), seconds (sec), and Coulombs (C) can be assumed.\nTable 2.1.1.\nSummary of electrodynamic nomenclature.\nName\nSymbol\nUnits\nDiscrete Variables\nVoltage or potential difference\nv\n[V] = volts = m2 kg/C sec2\nCharge\nq\n[C] = Coulombs = C\nCurrent\ni\n[A] = Amperes = C/sec\nMagnetic flux\nX\n[Wb] = Weber = m2 kg/C sec\nCapacitance\nC\n[F] = Farad C2 sec 2 /m2 kg\nInductance\nL\n[H] = Henry = m2 kg/C2\nForce\nf\n[N] = Newtons = kg m/sec2\nField Sources\nFree charge density\nPf\nC/m3\nFree surface charge density\n-f\nC/m2\nFree current density\n4f\nA/m2\nFree surface current density\nKf\nA/m\nFields (name in quotes is often used for convenience)\n\"Electric field\" intensity\nV/m\n\"Magnetic field\" intensity\nA/m\nElectric displacement\nC/m2\nMagnetic flux density\nWb/m 2 (tesla)\nPolarization density\nC/m2\nMagnetization density\nM\nA/m\nForce density\nF\nN/m3\nPhysical Constants\nPermittivity of free space\n6o = 8.854 x 1012\nF/m\nPermeability of free space\n1o = 4r x 10- 7\nH/m\nAlthough terms involving moving magnetized and polarized media may not be familiar, Maxwell's\nequations are summarized without prelude in the next section. The physical significance of the un-\nfamiliar terms can best be discussed in Secs. 2.8 and 2.9 after the general laws are reduced to their\nquasistatic forms, and this is the objective of Sec. 2.3.\nExcept for introducing concepts concerned\nwith the description of continua, including integral theorems, in Secs. 2.4 and 2.6, and the dis-\ncussion of Fourier amplitudes in Sec. 2.15, the remainder of the chapter is a parallel development of\nthe consequences of these quasistatic laws. That the field transformations (Sec. 2.5), integral laws\n(Sec. 2.7), splicing conditions (Sec. 2.10), and energy storages are derived from the fundamental quasi-\nstatic laws, illustrates the important dictum that internal consistency be maintained within the frame-\nwork of the quasistatic approximation.\nThe results of the sections on energy storage are used in Chap. 3 for deducing the electric and\nmagnetic force densities on macroscopic media. The transfer relations of the last sections are an\nimportant resource throughout all of the following chapters, and give the opportunity to explore the\nphysical significance of the quasistatic limits.\n2.2 Differential Laws of Electrodynamics\nIn the Chu formulation,l with material effects on the fields accounted for by the magnetization\ndensity M and the polarization density P and with the material velocity denoted by v, the laws of\nelectrodynamics are:\nFaraday's law\n4+\n3H\nP--\nat\no\nM\n+\n(\no\nSt\no\nBt\n1.

In this formulation the electric displacement\nand magnetic flux\ndensity B are defined fields:\nD =\nE + P\n(6)\no\n4-\n-\nB =\no(H + M)\n(7)\n2.3\nQuasistatic Laws and the Time-Rate Expansion\nWith a quasistatic model, it is recognized that relevant time rates of change are sufficiently\nlow that contributions due to a particular dynamical process are ignorable. The objective in this\nsection is to give some formal structure to the reasoning used to deduce the quasistatic field equa-\ntions from the more general Maxwell's equations. Here, quasistatics specifically means that times\nof interest are long compared to the time, Tem, for an electromagnetic wave to propagate through the\nsystem.\nGenerally, given a dynamical process characterized by some time determined by the parameters of\nthe system, a quasistatic model can be used to exploit the comparatively long time scale for proc-\nesses of interest. In this broad sense, quasistatic models abound and will be encountered in many\nother contexts in the chapters that follow. Specific examples are:\n(a) processes slow compared to wave transit times in general; acoustic waves and the model is\none of incompressible flow, Alfvyn and other electromechanical waves and the model is less standard;\n(b) processes slow compared to diffusion (instantaneous diffusion models). What diffuses can\nbe magnetic field, viscous stresses, heat, molecules or hybrid electromechanical effects;\n(c) processes slow compared to relaxation of continua (instantaneous relaxation or constant-\npotential models). Charge relaxation is an important example.\nThe point of making a quasistatic approximation is often to focus attention on significant\ndynamical processes. A quasistatic model is by no means static.\nBecause more than one rate process\nis often imbedded in a given physical system, it is important to agree upon the one with respect to\nwhich the dynamics are quasistatic.\nRate processes other than those due to the transit time of electromagnetic waves enter through\nthe dependence of the field sources on the fields and material motion. To have in view the additional\ncharacteristic times typically brought in by the field sources, in this section the free current\ndensity is postulated to have the dependence\nJf = G(r)E + Jv(v,pf,H)\n(i)\nIn the absence of motion, Jv is zero. Thus, for media at rest the conduction model is ohmic, with the\nel-ctrical conductivity a in general a funqtion Qf position. Examples of Jv are a convection current\npfv, or an ohmic motion-induced current a(v x\n0oH).\nWith an underbar used to denote a normalized\nquantity, the conductivity is normalized to a typical (constant) conductivity a :\na =\n(r,t)\n(2)\no-\nTo identify the hierarchy of critical time-rate parameters, the general laws are normalized.\nCoordinates are normalized to one typical length X, while T represents a characteristic dynamical time:\n(x,y,z) = (Zx,kY,kz);\nt = Tt\n(3)\nSecs. 2.2 & 2.3\n\nIn a system sinusoidally excited at the angular frequency\n, T= W-1l\nIn a system sinusoidally excited at the angular frequency w, T=w\nThe most convenient normalization of the fields depends on the specific system. Where electro-\nmechanical coupling is significant, these can usually be categorized as \"electric-field dominated\" and\n\"magnetic-field dominated.\"\nAnticipating this fact, two normalizations are now developed \"in parallel,\"\nthe first taking e as a characteristic electric field and the second taking _ as.a characteristic mag-\nnetic field:\no\nv\nT -v\np E\nf\nH\n+\npf =- 9 , H=-\n-H,MM T-\nH = H,\nM v = (/),\n=\nJ\n=\nLf\n-v\nE=\nP Pf\np-,. P=f\n,\n-\nP\nIt might be appropriate with this step to recognize that the material motion introduces a characteristic\n(transport) time other than T. For simplicity, Eq. 4 takes the material velocity as being of the order\nof R/T.\nThe normalization used is arbitrary. The same quasistatic laws will be deduced regardless of the\nstarting point, but the normalization will determine whether these laws are \"zero-order\" or higher order\nin a sense to now be defined.\nThe normalizations of Eq. 4 introduced into Eqs. 2.2.1-5 result in\nV.1 = -V.y + pf\nV.H = -V-M\n+T\n+.\n+\nE\n9P\n(\nx)\nVxH = -\naE\n+ J +\n+ -- +Vx (P xv)\nT\nv\n+t ~t\ne\nH+ 3\nx\nV\n~-V]\nVxE = -s\nt\nt + Vx (x\nSe F\n~f\nV.\nE + -\nV*J\nt+ ]\ne\nv\n't J\nV.E = -V.p +\nV.H = -V.M\nTm\nVxH = --\nE\nT\nS\nH\nVxE\n=\nat\n+ J + O\n+\nV x (Mx v)\n-y\nT\nDp\nV.

The time required for an electromagnetic plane wave to propa-\ngate the distance k at the velocity c is Tem. Given that there is just one characteristic length,\nthere are actually only two characteristic times, because as can be seen from Eq. 10\n(11)\nTme\nem\nUnless Te and Tm, and hence Tem, are all of the same order, there are only two possibilities for the\nrelative magnitudes of these times, as summarized in Fig. 2.3.1.\n18W(I\nI\nIr\nTm\n-\nelectroquasistati cs\nTCe\nmem\nmagnetoquasistatics\nFig. 2.3.1.

Note that T is still arbitrary relative to Te.\nIn the magnetoquasistatic (MQS) approximation, 0 is still small, but the ordering of characteristic times\nis as to the right. In this case, T is arbitrary relative to Tm.\nTo make a formal statement of the procedure used to find the quasistatic approximation, the normal-\nized fields and charge density are expanded in powers of the time-rate parameter 0.\nE = E + E1 +\nE2 +\n0o\n+\nH01\n+\n+2\n(12)\niv -\n( v)o + 0v)\n+0 ( )2 +\nPf = (Pf)o +\n(Pf) 1 +\n()2 +\nIn the following, it is assumed that constitutive laws relate P and M to E and H, so that these\ndensities are similarly expanded.

Thus higher order fields satisfy homo-\ngeneous boundary conditions.\nOnce the first order solutions are known, the process can be repeated with these forming the\n\"drives\" for the n=2 equations.\nIn the absence of loss effects, there are no characteristic times to distinguish MQS and EQS\nsystems. In that limit, which set of normalizations is used is a matter of convenience. If a situa-\ntion represented by the left-hand set actually has an EQS limit, the zero order laws become the quasi-\nstatic laws.\nBut, if these expressions are applied to a situation that is actually MQS, then first-\norder terms must be calculated to find the quasistatic fields. If more than the one characteristic\ntime Tern is involved, as is the case with finite Te and Tm, then the ordering of rate parameters can\ncontribute to the convergence of the expansion.\nIn practice, a formal derivation of the quasistatic laws is seldom used. Rather, intuition and\nexperience along with comparison of critical time constants to relevant dynamical times is used to\nidentify one of the two sets of zero order expressions as appropriate. But, the use of normalizations\nto identify critical parameters, and the notion that characteristic times can be used to unscramble\ndynamical processes, will be used extensively in the chapters to follow.\nWithin the framework of quasistatic electrodynamics, the unnormalized forms of Eqs. 13-17\nconmrise the \"exact\" field laws\nThese enuations are reordered to reflect their relative imnortance:\nElectroquasistatic (EQS)\nV.-E E= -V'P + Pf\nVx = 0\nS\napf\nV.Jf + -y-= 0\nVxH =\n+\n+2--\n+ Vx (P x v)\nf\nt\nat\nViiH = -V PoM\nMagnetoquasistatic (MQS)\nVx\n= f\n(23)\nV.1oH = -V.o M\n(24)\na4,.\nall\nH\nVxE\nat\nat\n-oV\nx (M x v) (25)\nV-J\n= o\n(26)\nVeoE = -VP + Pf\n(27)\nThe conduction current Jf has been reintroduced to reflect the wider range of validity of these\nequations than might be inferred from Eq. 1. With different conduction models will come different\ncharacteristic times,exemplified in the discussions of this section by Te and Tm . Matters are more\ncomplicated if fields and media interact electromechanically. Then, v is determined to some extent\nat least by the fields themselves and must be treated on a par with the field variables. The result\ncan be still more characteristic times.\nThe ordering of the quasistatic equations emphasizes the instantaneous relation between the\nrespective dominant sources and fields. Given the charge and polarization densities in the EQS system,\nor given the current and magnetization densities in the MQS system, the dominant fields are known and\nare functions only of the sources at the given instant in time.\nThe dynamics enter in the EQS system with conservation of charge, and in the MQS system with\nFaraday'l law of induction. Equations 26a and 27a are only needed 4f an after-the-fact determina-\ntion of H is to be made. An example where such a rare interest in H exists is in the small mag-\nnetic field induced by electric fields and currents within the human body. The distribution of in-\nternal fields and hence currents is determined by the first three EQS equations. Given 1, -, and\nJf, the remaining two expressions determine H. In the MQS system, Eq. 27b can be regarded as an\nexpression for the after-the-fact evaluation of pf, which is not usually of interest in such systems.\nWhat makes the subject of quasistatics difficult to treat in a general way,even for a system\nof fixed ohmic conductivity, is the dependence of the appropriate model on considerations not con-\nveniently represented in the differential laws. For example, a pair of perfectly conducting plates,\nshorted on one pair of edges and driven by a sinusoidal source at the opposite pair, will be MQS\nat low frequencies. The same pair of plates, open-circuited rather than shorted, will be electroquasi-\nstatic at low frequencies. The difference is in the boundary conditions.\nGeometry and the inhomogeneity of the medium (insulators, perfect conductors and semiconductors)\nare also essential to determining the appropriate approximation. Most systems require more than one\nSec. 2.3\n\ncharacteristic dimension and perhaps conductivity for their description, with the result that more than\ntwo time constants are often involved. Thus, the two possibilities identified in Fig. 2.3.1 can in\nprinciple become many possibilities. Even so, for a wide range of practical problems, the appropriate\nfield laws are either clearly electroquasistatic or magnetoquasistatic.\nProblems accompanying this section help to make the significance of the quasistatic limits more\nsubstantive by considering cases that can also be solved exactly.\n2.4 Continuum Coordinates and the Convective Derivative\nThere are two commonly used representations of continuum variables.\nOne of these is familiar\nfrom classical mechanics, while the other is universally used in electrodynamics. Because electro-\nmechanics involves both of these subjects, attention is now drawn to the salient features of the two\nrepresentations.\nConsider first the \"Lagrangian representation.\"\nThe position of a material particle is a natural\nexample and is depicted by Fig. 2.4.1a. When the time t is zero, a particle is found at the position\nro .\nThe position of the particle at some subsequent time is t. To let t represent the displacement of\na continuum of particles, the position variable ro is used to distinguish particles.\nIn this sense, the\ndisplacement y then also becomes a continuum variable capable of representing the relative displace-\nments of an infinitude of particles.\nu)\nkU)\nFig. 2.4.1.\nParticle motions represented in terms of (a) Lagrangian coordinates,\nwhere the initial particle coordinate ro designates the particle of\ninterest, and (b) Eulerian coordinates, where (x,y,z) designates the\nspatial position of interest.\nIn a Lagrangian representation, the velocity of the particle is simply\nat\nIf concern is with only one particle, there is no point in writing the derivative as a partial deriv-\native. However, it is understood that, when the derivgtive is taken, it is a particular particle\nwhich is being considered. So, it is understood that ro is fixed. Using the same line of reasoning,\nthe acceleration of a particle is given by\na at\nThe idea of representing continuum variables in terms of the coordinates (x,y,z) connected with\nthe space itself is familiar from electromagnetic theory. But what does it mean if the variable is\nmechanical rather than electrical? We could represent the velocit- of the continuum of particles\nfilling the space of interest by a vector function v(x,y,z,t) = v(r,t).\nThe velocity of particles\nhaving the position (x,y,z,) at a given time t is determined by evaluating the function v(r,t).\nThe\nvelocity appearing in Sec. 2.2 is an example. As suggested by Fig. 2.4.1b, if the function is the\nvelocity evaluated at a given position in space, it describes whichever particle is at that point at\nthe time of interest. Generally, there is a continuous stream of particles through the point (x,y,z).\nSecs. 2.3 & 2.4\n~\n)\n\nComputation of the particle acceleration makes evident the contrast between Eulerian and Lagrangian\nrepresentations. By definition, the acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity computed for a\ngiven particle of matter. A particle having the position (x,y,z) at time t will be found an instant\nAt later at the position (x + vxAt,y + vyAt,z + vzAt).\nHence the acceleration is\nv(x + v At,y + v At,z + v At,t + At) - v(x,y,z,t)\na=lim\nx\ny\nz\n(3)\nAt÷OAt\nExpansion of tje first term in Eq. 3 about the initial coordinates of the particle gives the convective\nderivative of v:\n+\nv\nav\nav\nav _\nv\n+\n+\na\n+ v\n+ v\n+ v\n+ v*Vv\n(4)\nt\nx ax\ny\ny\nz\n(4)at\nThe difference between Eq. 2 and Eq. 4 is resolved by recognizing the difference in the signi-\nficance of the partial derivatives. In Eq. 2, it is understood that the coordinates being held fixed\nare the initial coordinates of the particle of interest. In Eq. 4, the partial derivative is taken,\nholding fixed the particular point of interest in space.\nThe same steps .show that the rate of change of any vector variable A, as viewed from a particle\nhaving the velocity v, is\nDAaA 31\n+\n(\nS-\n+ (V);\nA = A(x,y,z,t)\n(5)\nThe time rate of change of any scalar variable for an observer moving with the velocity v is obtained\nfrom Eq. 5 by considering the particular case in which t has only one component, say 1 = f(x,y,z,t)Ax.\nThen Eq. 5 becomes\nDf\nf\n+f\nf- E - -+\nv.Vf\n(6)\nReference 3 of Appendix C is a film useful in understanding this section.\n2.5 Transformations between Inertial Frames\nIn extending empirically determined conduction, polarization and magnetization laws to include\nmaterial motion, it is often necessary to relate field variables evaluated in different reference\nframes. A given point in space can be designated either in terms of the coordinate 1 or of the co-\nordinate V' of Fig. 2.5.1. By \"inertial reference frames,\" it is meant that the relative velocity\nbetween these two frames is constant, designated by '. The positions in the two coordinate systems\nare related by the Galilean transformation:\nr'\n= r -\nut;\nt'\n= t\n(1)\nFig. 2.5.1\nReference frames have constant\nrelative velocity t. The co-\nordinates t = (x,y,z) and 1' =\n(x',y',z') designate the same\nposition.\nIt is a familiar fact that variables describing a given physical situation in one reference frame\nwill not be the same as those in the other. An example is material velocity, which, if measured in one\nframe, will differ from that in the other frame by the relative velocity ~.\nThere are two objectives in this section: one is to show that the quasistatic laws are invariant\nwhen subject to a Galilean transformation between inertial reference frames. But, of more use is the\nrelationship between electromagnetic variables in the two frames of reference that follows from this\nSecs. 2.4 & 2.5\n\nproof.\nThe\napproach\nis\nas\nfollows.\nFirst,\nthe\npostulate\nis\nmade\nthat\nthe\nquasistatic\nequations\ntake\nthe\nsame\nform\nin\nthe\nprimed\nand\nunprimed\ninertial\nreference\nframes.\nBut,\nin\nwriting\nthe\nlaws\nin\nthe\nprimed\nframe,\nthe\nspatial\nand\ntemporal\nderivatives\nmust\nbe\ntaken\nwith\nrespect\nto\nthe\ncoordinates\nof\nthat\nref-\nerence\nframe,\nand\nthe\ndependent\nfield\nvariables\nare\nthen\nfields\ndefined\nin\nthat\nreference\nframe.\nIn\ngeneral,\nthese\nmust\nbe\ndesignated\nby\nprimes,\nsince\ntheir\nrelation\nto\nthe\nvariables\nin\nthe\nunprimed\nframe\nis\nnot\nknown.\nFor\nthe\npurpose\nof\nwriting\nthe\nprimed\nequations\nof\nelectrodynamics\nin\nterms\nof\nthe\nun\nrimed\nco-\nFor\nthe nurnose o writina the nrimd enuations of elctrod-ax cs in tems of the u- rime\nordinates, recognize that\nV' + V\nA\na\n)+\n-\n= al\"\na-)+\n(-\n+ u*V)A\n-\n+ uV*A - Vx (uxA)\n+\n(+ uV9\n+Vu\n( t +\nE at\nThe left relations follow by using the chain rule of differentiation and the transformation of Eq. 1.\nThat the spatial derivatives taken with respect to one frame must be the same as those with respect\nto the other frame physically means that a single \"snapshot\" of the physical process would be all\nrequired to evaluate the spatial derivatives in either frame. There would be no way of telling which\nframe was the one from which the snapshot was taken. By contrast, the time rate of change for an\nobserver in the primed frame is, by definition, taken with the primed spatial coordinates held fixed.\nIn terms of the fixed frame coordinates, this is the convective derivative defined with Eqs. 2.4.5\nand 2.4.6. However, v in these equations is in general a function of space and time. In the context\nof this section it is saecialized to the constant u. Thus, in rewriting the convective derivatives of\nEq. 2 the constancy of u and a vector identity (Eq. 16, Appendix B) have been used.\nSo far, what has been said in this section is a matter of coordinates. Now, a physically motivated\npostulate is made concerning the electromagnetic laws. Imagine one electromagnetic experiment that is\nto be described from the two different reference frames. The postulate is that provided each of these\nframes is inertial, the governing laws must take the same form. Thus, Eqs. 23-27 apply with [V - V',\nc()/at - a()/at'] and all dependent variables primed. By way of comparing these laws to those ex-\npressed in the fixed-frame, Eqs. 2 are used to rewrite these expressions in terms of the unprimed in-\ndependent variables. Also, the moving-frame material velocity is rewritten in terms of the unprimed\nframe velocity using the relation\nv'\nv-\nu\nThus, the laws originally expressed in the primed frame of reference become\nV.e E'\nE\n-V.P'\n+ p\nf\nV x E' = 0\nV.(ij + up!) + -\nV x (' + ux C ') -\n(\n+ up )\naE$'\n+\n'\nx,\n+\n+\n+ V x (P x\nat\nat\nV~o\noM0\nV x i' =\nV*oH'\n-V.o0 M'\nVx('\n-\nu x ~i')\nal H0'\nat\nay M'\n-\n(6)\nat\n-\nV x (' x V)\n-\nf\nV~eo'\n=\nV.P'+\n!\nIn writing Eq. 7a, Eq. 4a is used. Similarly, Eq. 5b is used to write Eq. 6b. For the one experi-\nment under consideration, these equations will.predict the same behavior as the fixed frame laws,\nEqs. 2.3.23-27, if the identification is made:\nSec.\n2.5\n\nE- ,\nPE'= P\n4.\n+\nS= J\n-Upf\nH' .'A-i x eE\no\nand hence, from Eq. 2.2.6\nD' =D\nMQS\n'-\nA\n(9)\n4.\n+\nM' = M\n(10)\nJ\n= Jf\n(11)\nE'= E + ux poH\n(12)\n(13)\nand hence, from Eq. 2.2.7\nB' = B\n(14)\nThe primary fields are the same whether viewed from one frame or the other. Thus, the EQS elec-\ntric field polarization density and charge density are the same in both frames, as are the MQS mag-\nnetic field, magnetization density and current density. The respective dynamic laws can be associated\nwith those field transformations that involve the relative velocity. That the free current density\nis altered by the relative motion of the net free charge in the EQS system is not surprising. But, it\nis the contribution of this same convection current to Ampere's law that generates the velocity depend-\nent contribution to the EQS magnetic field measured in the moving frame of reference. Similarly, the\nvelocity dependent contribution to the MQS electric field transformation is a direct consequence of\nFaraday's law.\nThe transformations, like the quasistatic laws from which they originate, are approximate. It\nwould require Lorentz transformations to carry out a similar procedure for the exact electrodynamic\nlaws of Sec. 2.2. The general laws are not invariant in form to a Galilean transformation, and there-\nin is the origin of special relativity. Built in from the start in the quasistatic field laws is a\nself-consistency with other Galilean invariant laws describing mechanical continua that will be brought\nin in later chapters.\n2.6 Integral Theorems\nSeveral integral theorems prove useful, not only in the description of electromagnetic fields but\nalso in dealing with continuum mechanics and electromechanics. These theorems will be stated here with-\nout proof.\nIf it is recognized that the gradient operator is defined such that its line integral between two\nendpoints (a) and (b) is simply the scalar function evaluated at the endpoints, thenl\nI w4=\n-M)\n(1)\na\nTwo more familiar theorems1 are useful in dealing with vector functions. For a closed surface S, en-\nclosing the volume V, Gauss' theorem states that\nV*AdV =\n'-nda\n(2)\nV\nS\nwhile Stokes's theorem pertains to an open surface S with the contour C as its periphery:\nSV x A-1da =\nA'\n(3)\nS\nC\nIn stating these theorems, the normal vector is defined as being outward from the enclosed voluge for\nGauss' theorem, and the contour is taken as positive in a direction such that It is related to n by the\nright-hand rule. Contours, surfaces, and volumes are sketched in Fig. 2.6.1.\nA possibly less familiar theorem is the generalized Leibnitz rule.2 In those cases where the\nsurface is itself a function of time, it tells how to take the derivative with respect to time of the\nintegral over an open surface of a vector function:\n1.

The velocity vs is the velocity\nof the surface and the contour. Unless given a physical significance, its meaning is purely geometrical.\nA limiting form of the generalized Leibnitz rule will be handy in dealing with closed surfaces.\nLet the contour C of Eq. 4 shrink to zero, so that the surface S becomes a closed one. This process can\nbe readily visualized in terms of the surface and contour sketch in Fig. 2.6.1c if the contour C is\npictured as the draw-string on a bag. Then, if C\nV-1, and use is made of Gauss' theorem (Eq. 2),\nEq. 4 becomes a statement of how to take the time derivative of a volume integral when the volume is a\nfunction of time:\ndV = f\ndV +\ns.nda\n(5)\ntV\nVt\nS\nAgain, vs is the velocity of the surface enclosing the volume V.\n2.7 quasistatic Integral Laws\nThere are at least three reasons for desiring Maxwell's equations in integral form. First, the\nintegral equations are convenient for establishing jump conditions implied by the differential\nequations. Second, they are the basis for defining lumped parameter variables such as the voltage,\ncharge, current, and flux. Third, they are useful in understanding (as opposed to predicting) physical\nprocesses. Since Maxwell's equations have already been divided into the two quasistatic systems, it\nis now possible to proceed in a straightforward way to write the integral laws for contours, surfaces,\nand volumes which are distorting, i.e., that are functions of time. The velocity of a surface S is v .\nTo obtain the integral laws implied by the laws of Eqs. 2.3.23-27, each equation is either\n(i) integrated over an open surface S with Stokes's theorem used where the integrand is a curl operator\nto convert to a line integration on C and Eq. 2.6.4 used to bring the time derivative outside the\nintegral, or (ii) integrated over a closed volume V with Gauss' theorem used to convert integrations\nof a divergence operator to integrals over closed surfaces S and Eq. 2.6.5 used to bring the time\nderivative outside the integration:\n(E\n(E\n+ P).-da =\nfdV\nS\nV\nJnda\nI\nfdV = 0\nS\nV\nH.\n= IJf da\n(1)\nC\nS\n110 (H + M).nda - 0\n(2)\nS\n.\n-o(H\n+ M)*nda\n(3)\nC\nS\n-\nOPM x (:v-\n).h%\nC\nSecs. 2.6 & 2.7\n2.10\n\nH1.£ = J i.nda +\n(e E + P).n'da\nC\nS\nS\n+ F P x (v -\n')*\nC\nSJo(H + M)-nda = 0\nS\nwhere\nJ-\nJ - VsPf\n+\n4.\n.\nH' =H - v x sE\ns\no\nSf.-nda = 0\nS\n+ P).nda =\nPfdV\nV\nwhere\n4' -E+\ns\nx\n.\nE' -E+v\nxIIH\nThe primed variables are simply summaries of the variables found in deducing these equations. However,\nthese definitions are consistent with the transform relationships found in Sec. 2.5, and the velocity\nof these surfaces and contours, vs, can be identified with the velocity of an inertial frame instan-\ntaneously attached to the surface or contour at the point in question. Approximations implicit to the\noriginal differential quasistatic laws are now implicit to these integral laws.\n2.8 Polarization of Moving Media\nEffects of polarization and magnetization are included in the formulation of electrodynamics\npostulated in Sec. 2.2.\nIn this and the next section a review is made of the underlying models.\nConsider the electroquasistatic systems, where the dominant field source is the charge density.\nNot all of this charge is externally accessible, in the sense that it cannot all be brought to some\nposition through a conduction process. If an initially neutral dielectric medium is stressed by an\nelectric field, the constituent molecules and domains become polarized. Even though the material\nretains its charge neutrality, there can be a local accrual or loss of charge because of the polariza-\ntion. The first order of business is to deduce the relation of such polarization charge to the polari-\nzation density.\nFor conceptual purposes, the polarization of a material is pictured as shown in Fig. 2.8.1.\nFig. 2.8.1.\nModel for dipoles fixed to deformable material. The model pictures\nthe negative charges as fixed to the material, and then the positive\nhalves of the dipoles fixed to the negative charges through internal\nconstraints.\nSecs. 2.7 & 2.8\n2.11\n\nFig. 2.8.2\nPolarization results in net\ncharges passing through a\nsurface.\nThe molecules or domains are represented by dipoles composed of positive and negative charges +q,\nseparated by the vector distance 1. The dipole moment is then $ = qp, and if the particles have a\nnumber density n, the polarization density is defined as\nP = nqa\n(1)\nIn the most common dielectrics, the polarization results because of the application of an external\nelectric field.\nIn that case, the internal constraints (represented by the springs in Fig. 2.8.1)\nmake the charges essentially coincident in the absence of an electric field, so that, on the average,\nthe material is (macroscopically) neutral. Then,.with the application of the electric field, there\nis a separation of the charges in some direction which might be coincident with the applied electric\nfield intensity. The effect of the dipoles on the average electric field distribution is equivalent\nto that of the medium they model.\nTo see how the polarization charge density is related to the polarization density, consider the\nmotion of charges through the arbitrary surface S shown in Fig. 2.8.2. For the moment, consider the\nsurface as being closed, so that the contour enclosing the surface shown is shrunk to zero. Because\npolarization results in motion of the positive charge, leaving behind the negative image charge, the net\npolarization charge within the volume V enclosed by the surface S is equal to the negative of the net\ncharge having left the volume across the surface S. Thus,\nf\npdV = -\nnq.i~da = -\n*\"-da\n(2)\nP\nJ\nJ\nS\nS\nGauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, converts the surface integral to one over the arbitrary volume V. It\nfollows that the integrand must vanish so that\n4.\np\n= -\nV.P\n(3)\nThis polarization charge density is now added to the free charge density as a source of the electric\nfield intensity in Gauss' law:\nV.E = Pf +Pp\n(4)\nand Eqs. 3 and 4 comprise the postulated form of Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a.\nBy definition, polarization charge is conserved, independent of the free charge. Hence, the\npolarization current I is defined such that it satisfies the conservation equation\np\napp\nV*J + at-= 0\n(5)\np\nat\nTo establish the way in which J transforms between inertial reference frames, observe that in a primed\nframe of reference, by dint of Eq. 2.5.2c, the conservation of polarization charge equation becomes\nBap'\nV. [, + up'] + L=\n(6)\nIt has been shown that P, and hence pp, are the same in both frames (Eq. 2.5.10a).\nIt follows that the\nrequired transformation law is\nSJ -\nup\n(7)\np\np\np\nIf the dipoles are attached to a moving medium, so that the negative charges move with the same\nvelocity l as the moving material, the motion gives rise to a current which should be included in\nAmpere's law as a source of magnetic field. Even if the material is fixed, but the applied field is\nSec. 2.8\n2.12\n\ntime-varying so as to induce a time-varying polarization density, a given surface is crossed by a net\ncharge and there is a current caused by a time-varying polarization density. The following steps\ndetermine the current density 1p in terms of the polarization density and the material velocity.\nThe starting point is the statement\nS-nda =\nP.nda\n(8)\nP\nddt f\nS\nS\nThe surface S, depicted by Fig. 2.8.2, is attached to the material itself. It moves with the\nnegative charges of the dipoles. Integrated over this deforming surface of fixed identity, the polari-\nzation current density evaluated in the frame of reference of the material is equal to the rate of\nchange with respect to time of the net charge penetrating that surface.\nWith the surface velocity identified with the material velocity, Eq. 2.6.4 and Eq. 3 convert\nEq. 8 to\nap+4\naf\nt\nP\n+ f ' x v.\n(9)\nS\nS\nOn the left, J' is replaced by Eq. 7 evaluated with u = v, while on the right Stokes's theorem,\nEq. 2.6.3, is Rsed to convert the line integral to a surface integral. The result is an equation in\nsurface integrals alone. Although fixed to the deforming material, the surface S is otherwise arbitrary\nand so it follows that the required relation between 3p and I for the moving material is\n+\n1P\n+10\nJ =\n+ V x(P\n)\n(10)\np\nat\nIt is this current density that has been added to the right-hand side of Ampere's law, Eq. 2.3.26a,\nto complete the formulation of polarization effects in the electroquasistatic system.\n2.9 Magnetization of Moving Media\nIt is natural to use polarization charge to represent the effect of macroscopic media on the\nmacroscopic electric field. Actually, this is one of two alternatives for representing polarization.\nThat such a choice has been made becomes clear when the analogous question is asked for magnetization.\nIn the absence of magnetization, the free current density is the source of the magnetic field, and it\nis therefore natural to represent the macroscopic effects of magnetizable media on y through an equi-\nvalent magnetization current density. Indeed, this viewpoint is often used and supported by the con-\ntention that what is modeled at the atomic level is really a system of currents (the electrons in their\norbits).\nIt is important to understand that the use of equivalent currents, or of equivalent magnetic\ncharge as used here, if carried out self-consistently, results in the same predictions of physical\nprocesses. The choice of models in no way hinges on the microscopic processes accounting for the mag-\nnetization. Moreover, the magnetization is often dominated by dynamical processes that have more to do\nwith the behavior of domains than with individual atoms, and these are most realistically pictured as\nsmall magnets (dipoles). With the Chu formulation postulated in Sec. 2.2, the dipole model for\nrepresenting magnetization has been adopted.\nAn advantage of the Chu formulation is that magnetization is developed in analogy to polarization.\nBut rather than starting with a magnetic charge density, and deducing its relation to the polarization\ndensity, think of the magnetic material as influencing the macroscopic fields through an intrinsic flux\ndensity poi that might be given, or might be itself induced by the macroscopic A. For lack of evidence\nto support the existence of \"free\" magnetic monopoles, the total flux density due to all macroscopic\nfields must be solenoidal. Hence, the intrinsic flux density 'o\n4 0 , added to the flux density in free\nspace Plo,\nmust have no divergence:\nV.*o(, + M) = 0\n(1)\nThis is Eq. 2.3.24b.\nIt is profitable to think of -V.poM as a source of H. That is, Eq. 1 can\nbe written to make it look like Gauss' law for the electric field:\nV\nH4H= pm; Pm = -V'Vo0\n(2)\nThe magnetic charge density pm is in this sense the source of the magnetic field intensity.\nFaraday's law of induction must be revised if magnetization is present.\nIf\no-M is a magnetic flux\ndensity, then, through magnetic induction, its rate of change is capable of producing an induced electric\nfield intensity. Also, if Faraday's law of induction were to remain valid without alteration, then its\ndivergence must be consistent with Eq. 1; obviously, it is not.\nSecs. 2.8 & 2.9\n2.13\n\nTo generalize the law of induction to include magnetization, it is stated in integral form for a\ncontour C enclosing a surface S fixed to the material in which the magnetized entities are imbedded.\nThen, because 1o(A + M) is the total flux density,\n=E'*£\n= - d\nO(H + M)*nda\nThe electric field E' is evaluated in the frame of reference of the moving contour.

Fields are similarly often given a piece-\nwise representation with jump conditions used to \"splice\" them together at the discontinuities. These\nconditions, derived here for reference, are implied by the integral laws. They guarantee that the\nassociated differential laws are satisfied through the singular region of the discontinuity.\nA 71\nFig. 2.10.1.\nVolume element enclosing a boundary. Dimen-\nsions of area A are much greater than A.\nElectroquasistatic Jump Conditions: A section of the boundary can be enclosed by a volume element\nhaving the thickness A and cross-sectional area A, as depicted by Fig. 2.10.1. The linear dimensions of\nthe cross-sectional area A are, by definition, much greater than the thickness A. Implicit to this\nstatement is the assumption that, although the surface can be curvilinear, its radius of curvature must\nbe much greater than a characteristic thickness over which variations in the properties and fields take\nplace.\nThe normal vector n used in this section is a unit vector perpendicular to the boundary and directi\nfrom region b to region a, as.shown in Fig. 2.10.1. Since this same symbol is used in connection with\nintegral theorems and laws to denote a normal vector to surfaces of integration, these latter vectors\nare denoted by 1 .\nn\nFirst, consider the boundary conditions implied by Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a, with Eq. 2.8.3 used to\nintroduce pp. This law is first multiplied by vm and then integrated over the volume V:\nSecs. 2.9 & 2.10\n2.14\n\nvm V\noEdV\nmpfdV\nV\nV\n+ f VmpdV\nV\nHere, v is a coordinate (like x,y, or z) perpendicular to the boundary and hence in the direction of n,\nas shown in Fig. 2.10.1.\nFirst, consider the particular case of Eq. 1 with m = 0.

Thus, with volume charges to either side of the interface, there is an\nabrupt change in the rate of change of the electric field intensity normal to the boundary, but the\nfield is itself continuous. On the other hand, as illustrated by the sketches of Fig. 2.10.2b, if\nthere is an appreciable charge per unit area within the boundary, the electric field intensity is\ndiscontinuous, and undergoes a step discontinuity.\nSec. 2.10\nV\n1_______,\n2.15\n\nA somewhat less familiar situation is that of Fig. 2.10.2c. Within the boundary there are\nregions of large positive and negative charge concentrations with an associated intense electric field\nbetween. In the limit where the boundary becomes very thin, a component of the surface charge density\nbecomes a doublet, and the electric field becomes an impulse.\nThe double layer can be pictured as being positive surface charges disposed on one side of the\nboundary, and negative surface charges distributed on the other, with an internal component of the\nelectric field originating on the positive charges and terminating on the negative ones. The mag-\nnitude of the double layer is equal to the product of the positive surface charge density and the dis-\ntance between these layers, A. In the limit where the layer thickness becomes infinitely thin while the\ndouble-layer magnitude remains constant, the electric field within the double layer must approach\ninfinity. Thus, associated with the doublet of charge density, there is an impulse in the electric field\nintensity, as sketched in Fig. 2.10.2c.\nThe boundary condition to be used in connection with a double layer is found from Eq. 1 by letting\nm = 1. The left-hand side of Eq. 1 can be integrated by parts, so that it becomes\nf V.(EoV\n)dV - f\nE.*VvdV =\nV(pf + p )dV\n(4)\nV\nV\nV\nFor the incremental volume, the surface double layer density is defined as\np\nlim 1 f v(pf + pp)dV =\nv(p + p )dv\n(5)\nand so the right-hand side of Eq. 4 is ApE. The origin of the A axis remains to be defined but A\nv -v\nTo glean a jump condition from the equation, the second EQS law is incorporated. That I is irrotational,\nEq. 2.3.24a, is represented by defining the electric potential\nE = -VO\n(6)\nThus, the second term on the left in Eq. 4 becomes\nJe E*VvdV = -\nVO*VvdV = - f\nV*(OVv)dV + fE V2 vdV\n(7)\nV\nV\nV\nV\nEvaluation of V2v gives nothing because v is defined as a local Cartesian coordinate. The last inte-\ngral vanishes, and with the application of Gauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, it follows that Eq. 4 becomes\nr\nV-.t da + f e IVv.i da - Ap\n(8)\nSo\nn\no\nn\nA\nS\nS\nProvided that within the layer, E parallel to the interface and Q are finite (not impulses in the limit\nA÷0), Eq. 8 only has contributions to the surface integrals from the regions to either side of the inter-\nface. Thus,\nAEo(vEa -\nv Eb).\n+ Ae 0\n= ApE\n(9)\nThe origin of the v axis is adjusted to make the first term vanish. The required boundary condition\nto be associated with Eqs. 2.3.23a and 2.3.23b is\no II D= EP\n(10)\nThe gradient of Eq. 10 within the plane of the interface converts the jump condition to one in\nterms of the electric field:\nEo a\nID\n- VEZE\n(11)\nHere VE is the surface gradient and t denotes components tangential to the interfacial plane.\nIn the absence of a double-layer surface density, these last two boundary conditions are the\nfamiliar statement that the tangential electric field intensity at a boundary must be continous. The\nstatement given in Eq. 10 that the potential must be continuous at a boundary is another way of stating\nSec. 2.10\n2.16\n\nthis requirement on the tangential electric field intensity. With a double layer, the tangential elec-\ntric field intensity is discontinuous, as is also the potential.\nEquations 10 and 11 could also be derived using the condition that the line integral of the electric\nfield intensity around a closed loop intersecting the boundary vanish. Usually, the tangential electric\nfield is continuous because there is no contribution to this line integral from those segments of the\ncontour passing through the boundary. However, with the double layer, the electric field intensity with-\nin the boundary is infinite; so, even though the segments of the line integral across the boundary vanish\nas A -\n0, there is a net contribution from these segments of the integration.\nIt is clear that higher order singularities could also be handled by considering values of m in\nEq. 1 greater than unity. However, the doublet is as singular a charge distribution as of interest\nphysically.\nThere are two reasons for wishing to include the doublet charge distribution, one mathematical and\none physical. Just as the surface charge density is a singularity in the volume charge density which\ncan be used to terminate a normal electric field intensity at a boundary, the double layer is a termination\nof a tangential electric field. On the physical side, there are many situations in which a double layer\nactually exists within a very thin region of material. Double layers abound at interfaces between liquids\nand metals and between metals. The double-layer concept is useful for modeling electromechanical coupling\ninvolving these interfacial regions.\nSo far, those EQS laws have been considered that do not explicitly involve time rates of change.\nConservation of charge does involve a dynamic term. Its associated boundary conditions can therefore\nbe derived only by making further stipulations as to the nature of the boundary. It is now admitted that\nthe boundary can, in general, be one which is deforming. Because time did not appear explicitly in the\nprevious derivations of this section, the conditions derived are automatically appropriate, even if the\nboundary is moving.\nThe integral form of charge conservation, Eq. 2.7.3a, is written for a volume V and surface S\ntied to the material itself.\nThus, with _\n+-,\n(J\n- pf-V)ida = -\np dV\n(12)\nS\nV\nAs seen in Fig. 2.10.1, the volume of integration always encloses material of fixed identity and inter-\nsects the boundary. Implicit to this statement is the assumption that the boundary is one of demarca-\ntion between material regions. The material velocity is presumed to at most have a step singularity\nacross the boundary.\n(It is important to recognize that there are other types of boundaries. For\nexample, the boundary could be a shock front, with a gas moving through from one side of the interface\nto the other. In that case, the boundary conditions thus far derived would remain correct, because no\nmention has yet been made of the physical nature of the boundary.)\nThe left-hand side of Eq. 12 can be handled in a manner similar to that already illustrated, since\nit does not involve time rates of change. The integration is divided into two parts: one over the upper\nand lower surfaces of the volume, the other over the parts of the surface which intersect the boundary.\nThe contributions to a current flow through these side surfaces comes from a surface current.\nIt follows\nby using a two-dimensional form of Gauss' theorem, Eq. 2.6.2, that the left-hand side of Eq. 12 is\nf (J - PfV)T.nda + Ji\n- Pfy).\nda = A{n.\n- vpf0 + V\nf -\nvt)}\n(13)\nS'+S\"\nS\"'\nHere, A is the area of intersection between the volume element and the boundary. The right-hand side of\nEq. 12 is, by the definition of Eq. 3,\nSjpfdV =~\nafda\n(14)\nV\nA\nNote that, if the volume of integration V, and hence the area of integration A, is one always fixed to\nthe material, then the area A is time-varying. The surface charge density is a function only of the\ntwo dimensions within the plane of the interface. Thus, the term on the right in Eq. 14 is a time\nderivative of a two-dimensional integral. This is a two-dimensional special case of the situation\ndescribed by the generalized Leibnitz rule, Eq. 2.6.5, which stated how the time derivative of a volume\nintegral could be represented, even if the volume of integration were time-varying. Thus, Eq. 14 becomes\ndt PfdV = A[-\n+ V(vt f)\n(15)\n2.1\n2.17\nSec. 2.10\n\nFinally, with the use of Eqs. 13 and 15, Eq. 12 becomes the required jump condition representing charge\nconservation:\nSJfPfV\n- p\n+ VK f =\nt\n(16)\nBy contrast with Eqs. 10 and 11, the expression is specialized to interfaces that do not support charge\ndistributions so singular as a double layer. In using Eq. 16, note that a partial derivative with\nrespect to time is usually defined as one taken holding the spatial coordinates constant. A review of\nthe derivation of Eq. 16 will make it clear that such is not the significance of the partial derivative\non the right in Eq. 16. The surface charge density is not defined throughout the three-dimensional\nspace. Thus, this derivative means the partial derivative with respect to time, holding the coordinates\nwithin the plane of the interface constant.\nThe component of current normal to the boundary represented by the first term in Eq. 16 will be\nrecognized as the free current density in a frame of reference moving with the boundary. A good questior\nwould be, \"why is it that the normal current density appears in Eq. 16 evaluated in the primed frame of\nreference, while the surface free current density is not?\" The answer points to the physical situation\nfor which Eq. 16 is appropriate. As the material boundary moves in the normal direction, the material\nahead and behind carries a charge distribution along, but one that never reaches the boundary.

Thus, the surface divergence appearing in the second\nterm of Eq. 16 can include both a conduction surface current and a convection surface current.\nMagnetoquasistatic Jump Conditions: The integral forms of Ampere's law and Gauss' law for magnetic\nfields incorporate no time rates of change. Hence, the jump conditions implied by these laws are\nfamiliar from elementary electrodynamics. Ampere's law, Eq. 2.7.1b, is integrated over the surface S\nand around the contour C enclosing the boundary, as sketched in Fig, 2.10.3, to obtain\nS\n= K\n(17)\nwhere Kf is the surface current density. Although it is entirely possible to consider a doublet of\ncurrent density as a model, this impulsive singularity in the distribution of free current density is\nof as high an order as necessary to model MQS electromechanical situations of general interest.\nFrom Gauss' law for magnetic fields, Eq. 2.7.2b,\napplied to the incremental volume enclosing the interface,\nFig. 2.10.1, the jump condition is\n*1o(H\nW + WIf = 0\n(18)\nFaraday's law of induction brings into play the time\nrate of change, and it is expected that motion of the\nboundary leads to an addition to the jump condition not\nfound for stationary media.

Contour of integration C\nC\nS\nenclosing a surface S that inter-\nsects the boundary between regions\nWith Eq. 19, it has already been assumed that the boundary\n(a) and (b).\nis a material one. Consistent with Eq. 17 is the assumption\nthat it can be carrying a surface current with it as it deforms.\nIf the surface S were not one of fixed\nidentity, this would mean that the surface integral on the right could be a step function of time as the\nboundary passed through the surface of integration. The result would be a temporal impulse on the right\nwhich would make a contribution to the boundary condition even in the limit where the surface S becomes\nvanishingly small.\nBy contrast, because the surface S is one of fixed identity, in the limit where the\nsurface area vanishes, the right-hand side of Eq. 19 makes no contribution.\nWith the assumption that fields and velocity are at most step functions across the boundary, the\nintegral on the left in Eq. 19 gives\nnix\nl+ v+x p0DH\n= 0\n(20)\nThis expression is what would be expected, in view of the transformation law for the electric field in\nSec. 2.10\n2.18\n\nthe MQS system.

Similarly, Eq. 24b follows from the solenoidal nature of the MQS current density.\nFinally, Eq. 24a follows from the EQS form of Ampere's law, integrated over the surface S of Fig. 2.10.3,\nfollowing the line of reasoning used in connection with Eq. 20.\n2.11 Lumped Parameter Electroquasistatic Elements\nLumped parameter electromechanical models are sufficiently practical that they warrant detailed\nexamination.1\nEven though the electromechanical coupling may be of a definitely continuum and dis-\ntributed nature, it is most often the case that interest is in inputs and outputs at discrete terminal\npairs.\nThis section reviews the definition of energy storage elements in EQS systems.\nAn abstract representation of a system of perfectly conducting electrodes, each having a potential\nvi relative to a reference electrode, is shown in Fig. 2.11.1.

Perfectly conducting coils are excited at their terminals by currents ii\nand, in general, coupled together by the induced magnetic flux. The surrounding medium is magnetizable\nSecs. 2.11 & 2.12\n2.20\n\nFig. 2.12.1\nSchematic representation\n()\nof a system of perfectly\nconducting coils. The\nith coil is shown with the\n(b)\nwire assuming the contour\nCi enclosing a surface Si.\nThere is a total of n coils\nin the system.\nbut free of electrical losses. The total flux Ai linked by the ith coil is a terminal variable, defined\nsuch that\n=\nBnda\n(1)\nSi\nA positive A is determined by first assigning the direction of a positive current ii. Then, the direc-\ntion of the normal vector (and hence the positive flux) to the surface Sienclosed by the contour Ci\nfollowed by the current ii,has a direction consistent with the right-hand rule, as Fig. 2.12.1 illus-\ntrates.\nBecause the MQS current density is solenoidal, the same current flows through the cross section\nof the wire at any point. Thus, the terminal current is defined by\n=\nJ\nf\nin\nda\n(2)\nsi\nwhere the surface si intersects all of the cross section of the wire at any point, as illustrated in the\nfigure.\nThe first two MQS equations are sufficient to determine the flux linkages as a function of the cur-\nrent excitations and the geometry of the coil. Thus, Ampere's law and the condition that the magnetic\nflux density be solenoidal are solved to obtain relations having the form\nAi\ni(il\"\n**in, 1''\nm)\n(3)\nIf the materials involved are magnetically linear, so that B = pH, where p is a function of position but\nnot of time or the fields, then it is convenient to define inductance parameters which depend only on\nthe geometry:\nfI\nThe inductance Lij is the flux linked by the ith coil per unit current in the jth coil, with all other\ncurrents zero.

By contrast with the EQS fields, the electric field here is not irrotational.\nThis\nmeans that the remaining integration of the electric field intensity between the terminals must be care-\nfully defined. Usually, the terminals are located in a region in which the magnetic field is sufficiently\nsmall to take the electric field intensity as being irrotational, and therefore definable in terms of the\ngradient of the potential.

Results are a first step in the derivation of macroscopic force densities\nin Chap. 3. Energy storage in a conservative EQS system is considered first, followed by a statement\nof power flow. In this and the next section the macroscopic medium is at rest.\nThermodynamics: Whether in electric or magnetic form, energy storage follows from the definition\nof the electric field as a force per unit charge. The work required to transport an element of charge,\n6q, from a reference position to a position p in the presence of the electric field intensity is\n6w= -P\n6qE.di\n(1)\nref\nThe integral is the work done by the external force on the electric subsystem in placing the charge at p.\nIf this process can be reversed, it can be said that the work done results in a stored energy equal to\nEq. 1. In an electroquasistatic system, the electric'field is irrotational. Hence,\n-Vt.\nThen, if\nOref is defined as zero, it follows that Eq. 1 becomes\n6w = fP6qVa .P = 6qO\n(2)\nref\nwhere use has been made of the gradient integral theorem, Eq. 2.6.1. Consider now energy storage in\nthe system abstractly represented by Fig. 2.13.1.\nThe system is perfectly insulating, except for the\nperfectly conducting electrodes introduced into the volume of interest, as in Sec. 2.11. It will be\ntermed an \"electroquasistatic thermodynamic subsystem.\"\nThe electrodes have terminal variables as defined in Sec. 2.11; voltages vi and total charges qi.\nBut, in addition, the volume between the electrodes supports a free charge density pf. By definition,\nthe energy stored in assembling these charges is equal to the work required to carry the charges from a\nreference position to the positions of interest. Thus, the incremental energy storage associated with\nincremental changes in the electrode charges, 6qi, or in the charge density, 6Pf, in a given neighbor-\nhood on the insulator, is\nSecs. 2.12 & 2.13\n2.22\n\n-\n--\n--------------\n--------\n-\n------------------\nI - -\n--r--\n- --..\n.-\n\\\\\n\\\"\n'(\n\\%\n:;;;\nth\nlectrodE\n,Pf)\nFig. 2.13.1\nSchematic representation\nof electroquasistatic\nsystem composed of per-\nfectly conducting elec-\ntrodes imbedded in a per-\nfectly insulating dielec-\ntric medium.\nn\n6w = E vi 6qi + J @6pfdV\ni=l\nV'\nV1\nThe volume V' is the volume excluded by the electrodes. Note that the reference electrode is not in-\ncluded in the summation, because the electric potential on that electrode is, by definition, zero. The\nwork required to place a free charge at its final position correctly accounts for the polarization,\nbecause the polarization charges induced in carrying the free charges to their final position are re-\nflected in the potential.\nConsider now the field representation of the electroquasistatic stored energy. From Gauss' law\n(Eq. 2.3.23a), the contribution of the summation in Eq. 3 can be represented in terms of an integral\nover the surfaces Si of the electrodes:\nn\n6w = E\n.i6D.nda\n+ f6pfdV\ni=l1\ni DJ\nHere, Di is the potential on the surface Si .\nThe surfaces enclosing the electrodes can be joined to-\ngether at infinity, as shown in Fig. 2.13.1. The resulting simply connected surface encloses all of the\nelectrodes, the wires as they extend to infinity, with the surface completed by a closure at infinity.\nThus, the surface integration called for with the first term on the right in Eq. 4 can be represented\nby an integration over a closed surface. Gauss' theorem is then used to convert this surface integral\nto a volume integration. However, note that the normal vector used in Eq. 4 points into the volume V'\nexcluded by the electrodes and included by the surface at infinity. Thus, in using Gauss' theorem,\na minus sign is introduced and Eq. 4 becomes\n6w = - J V*(6'D)dV + J c6pfdV = f [-WV.6D - 6D-VO + 06pf]dV\nV'\nVI\nV'\nIn rewriting the integral, the identity V*.C = C.VQ + yV-V has been used.\nFrom Gauss' law, 6pf = 6V.D = V*6D.\nIt follows that the first and last terms in Eq. 5 cancel.\nAlso, the electric field is irrotational (\n= -VW).\nSo Eq. 5 becomes\n6w =\nE.6DdV\nV\nThere is no E inside the electrodes, so the integration is now over all of the volume V.\nThe integrand in Eq. 6 is an energy density, and it is therefore appropriate to define the in-\ncremental change in electric energy density as\n6W = E*D\nSec. 2.13\n----------------------------------------\n2.23\n\nThe field representation of the energy, as given by Eqs. 6 and 7, should be compared to that for\nlumped parameters. Suppose all of the charge resided on electrodes. Then, the second term in Eq. 3\nwould be zero, and the incremental change in energy would be given by the first term:\nn\n6w = E vijqi\nComparison of Eqs. 6 and 8 suggests that the electric field plays a role analogous to the terminal voltage,\nwhile the displacement vector is the analog of the charge on the electrodes. If the relationship between\nthe variables P and t, or v and q, is single-valued, then the energy density and the total energy in the\ncontinuum and lumped parameter systems can be viewed, respectively, as integrals or areas under curves\nas sketched in Fig. 2.13.2.\nIf it is more convenient to have all of the voltages,\nrather than the charges, as independent variables, then\nLegendre's dual transformation can be used. That is, with\nthe observation that\nvi6q i\n6vi= -\nqi6vi\nEq. 8 becomes\nn\nn\n6w' = Z qi6vi; w' i\n(viqi - w)\ni=l\ni=l\nsv t\n8oV L\nor\n8E\n(10)\nwith w' defined as the coenergy function.\nIn an analogous manner, a coenergy density, W',\nis defined by writing -6-6= 6(.$) - -.6 and thus\ndefining\n6W'\n= D.6E; W' - E*D - W\nv or E\nI Or\nVI\n-----------------------\nWor W\nworW\nI\n-I\n-4 o\n8q or 8D\nq or D\n(11)\nThe coenergy and coenergy density functions have\nthe geometric relationship to the energy and energy den-\nsity functions, respectively, sketched in Fig. 2.13.2.\nIn those systems in which there is no distribution of\ncharge other than on perfectly conducting electrodes,\nEqs. 6 and 8 can be regarded as equivalent ways of computing\nquasistatic energy. If the charge is distributed throughout\nFig. 2.13.2. Geometric representation\nof energy w, coenergy w', energy\ndensity W, and coenergy density W'\nfor electric field systems.\nthe same incremental change in electro-\nthe volume, Eq. 6 remains valid.\nWith the notion of electrical energy storage goes the concept of a conservative subsystem. In\nthe process of building up free charges on perfectly conducting electrodes or slowly conducting charge\nto the bulk positions (one mechanism for carrying out the process pictured abstractly by Eq. 3), the\nwork is stored much as it would be in cocking a spring. The electrical energy, like that of the spring,\ncan later be released (discharged). Included in the subsystem is storage in the polarization. For\nwork done on polarizable entities to be stored, this polarization process must also be reversible. Here,\nit is profitable to think of the dipoles as internally constrained by spring-like nondissipative\nelements, capable of releasing energy when the polarizing field is turned off. Mathematically, this\nrestriction on the nature of the polarization is brought in by requiring that y and hence y be a single-\nvalued function of the instantaneous g, or that e = 2($). In lumped parameter systems, this is tanta-\nmount to q = q(v) or v = v(q).\nPower Flow: The electric and polarization energy storage subsystem is the field theory generaliza-\ntion of a capacitor. Just as practical circuits involve a capacitor interconnected with resistors\nand other types of elements, in any actual physical system the ideal energy storage subsystem is im-\nbedded with and coupled to other subsystems. The field equations, like Kirchhoff's laws in circuit\ntheory, encompass all of these subsystems. The following discussion is based on forming quadratic\nexpressions from the field laws, and hence relate to the energy balance between subsystems.\nFor a geometrical part of the ith subsystem, having the volume V enclosed by the surface S, a\nstatement of power flow takes the integral form\niin)da\nS\nat\n+\ni- dV =V idV\nV\n(12)\nSec. 2.13\nS1W\n2.24\n\nHere, Si is the power flux density, Wi is the energy density, and *i is the dissipation density.\nDifferent subsystems can occupy the same volume V. In Eq. 12, V is arbitrary, while i distinguishes\nthe particular physical processes considered. The differential form of Eq. 12 follows by applying Gauss'\ntheorem to the first term and (because V is arbitrary) setting the integrand to zero:\naw\nSi+at\ni\n(13)\nThis is a canonical form which will be used to describe various subsystems. In a given region, Wi can\nincrease with time either because of the volumetric source #i or because of a power flux -§:'i into the\nregion across its bordering surfaces.\nFor an electrical lumped parameter terminal pair, power is the product of voltage and current. This\nserves as a clue for finding a statement of power flow from the basic laws.\nThe generalization of the\nvoltage is the potential, while conservation of charge as expressed by Eq. 2.3.25a brings in the free\ncurrent density. So, the sum of Eqs. 2.3.25a and the conservation of polarization charge equation,\nEq. 2.8. 5, is multiplied by 0 to obtain\n[V. (f+J\n+\n(p + pp)] = 0\n(14)\nWith the objective an expression having the form of Eq. 13, a vector identity (Eq. 15, Appendix B)\nand Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a, convert Eq. 14 to\nV.[ (J + J )] + E. (\n+ J)\n++4 -\nVCoE - 0\n(15)\nIn the last term the time derivative and divergence are interchanged and the vector identity used again\nto obtain the expression\naw\nV\nae\n+ we\ne\n(16)\n+ at\nwhere, with Eq. 2.8.10 used for Jp,\nB.E\n+ D\nte\nt\no\n=\nat\ne\n\\(if +J p +\nt\natt\n-1\n+÷÷\nW\n-\nE*E\ne\n2 o\n-E\n-(J\n+ J )\n-E*[J\n+ -- + V x (P x v)]\nWhich terms appear where in this expression is a matter of what part of a physical system (which subsystem)\nis being described. Note that We does not include energy stored by polarizing the medium. Also, it can\nbe shown that V.Se = V.(1 x f), so that 1e is the poynting vector familiar from conventional classical\nelectrodynamics. In the dissipation density, I-.f can represent work done on an external mechanical\nsystem due to polarization forces or, if the polarization process involves dissipation, heat energy\ngiven up to a thermal subsystem.\nThe polarization terms in Oe can also represent energy storage in the polarization. This is illus-\ntrated by specializing Eq. 16 to describe a subsystem in which - is a single-valued function of the\ninstantaneous -, the free current density is purely ohmic, f = at, and the medium is at rest. Then, the\npolarization term from 4e can be lumped with the energy density term to describe power flow in a subsystem\nthat includes energy storage in the polarization:\nawE\nV.E + at\nE\n(17)\nwhere\nS\nQ\n+\nWE\naD\nEE\nEE\no\nSec. 2.13\n2.25\n\nNote that the integral defining the energy density WE, which is consistent with Eq. 7, involves an inte-\ngrand t which is time dependent only through the time dependence of 8: 1 = '[f(t)].\nThus, aWE/at =\nE.(-/at).\nWith the power flux density placed on the right, Eq. 17 states that the energy density decreases\nbecause of electrical losses (note that *E < 0) and because of the divergence of the power density.\n2.14\nConservation of Magnetoquasistatic Energy\nFundamentally, the energy stored in a magnetic field involves the same work done by moving a test\ncharge from a reference position to the position of interest as was the starting point in Sec. 2.13.\nBut, the same starting point leads to an entirely different form of energy storage. In a magnetoquasi-\nstatic system, the net free charge is a quantity evaluated after the fact. A self-consistent representa-\ntion of the fields is built upon a statement of current continuity, Eq. 2.3.26b, in which the free\ncharge density is ignored altogether. Yet, the energy stored in a magnetic field is energy stored in\ncharges transported against an electric field intensity. The apparent discrepancy in these statements is\nresolved by recognizing that the charges of interest in a magnetoquasistatic system are at least of\ntwo species, with the charge density of one species alone far outweighing the net charge density.\nThermodynamics: Because the free current density is solenoidal, a current \"tube\" can be defined as\nshown in Fig. 2.14.1. This tube is defined with a cross section having a normal yn in the direction of\nthe local current density, and a surrounding surface having a normal perpendicular to the local current\ndensity. An example of a current tube is a wire surrounded by insulation and hence carrying a total cur-\nrent i which is the same at one cross section as at another.\nFig. 2.14.1\nCurrent tube defined as having\ncross-sectional area ds per-\npendicular\nto\nthe\nt\ndensity, and an outside surface\nwith a normal vector perpendicular\nto the current density.\ni\nFor bipolar conduction, and a stationary medium, the current density within the tube is related\nto the charge density by the expression\n4.\nJf = pv+ - pv_\n(1)\nHere the conduction process is visualized as involving two types of carriers, one positive, with a charge\ndensity p+, and the other negative, with a magnitude p-. The carriers then have velocities which are,\nrespectively, v+ and\n_..\nEven though there is a current density, in the magnetoquasistatic system there\nis essentially no net charge: pf = p+ -\np- = 0. In an increment of time 6t, the product of the respective\ncharge densities and net displacements is p+v+6t and - p.0.6t. The work done on the charges as they\nundergo these displacements is the energy stored in magnetic form. This work is computed by recognizing\nthat the force on each of the charged species is the product of the charge density and the electric\nfield intensity. Hence, the energy stored in the field by a length of the current tube d£ is to first\norder in differentials dt and ds,\n-(pv\n-p_v\n).E6tdsdi = -Jf*E6tdsdk\n(2)\nThe expression for the free current density, Eg. i, is used on the right to restate the energy stored\nin the increment of time 6t.\nThe unit vector In is defined to be the direction of if. Thus, If =\nCf('n)tn. Because the current density is solenoidal, it follows closed paths. The product If.tnds\nis, by definition, constant along one of these paths, and if Indi is defined as an increment of the\nline integral, it then follows from Eq. 2 that the energy stored in a single current tube is\n1 d(\n(3)\nC\nSecs. 2.13 & 2.14\n2.26\n\nFig. 2.14.2\nSchematic representation of\na magnetoquasistatic energy\nstorage system. Currents\nare either distributed in\ncurrent loops throughout the\nvolume of interest, or con-\nfined to one of n possible\ncontours connected to the\ndiscrete terminal pairs.\nBy contrast with the electroquasistatic system, in which the electric field intensity is induced\nby the charge density (Gauss' law), the electric field intensity in Eq. 3 is clearly rotational. This\nemphasizes the essential role played by Faraday's law of magnetic induction.\nIt is helpful to have in mind at least the abstraction of a physical system. Figure 2.14.2 shows\na volume of interest in which the currents are either distributed throughout the volume or confined to\nparticular contours (coils), the latter case having been discussed in Sec. 2.12.\nFirst, consider the energy stored in the current paths defined by coils having cross-sectional\narea ds. From Eq. 3, this contribution to the total energy is conveniently written as\n-* .nds(\nE.ndG)6t =\nXi\n(4)\nC.\nFaraday's law and the definition of flux linkage, Eqs. 2.12.1 and 2.12.6, are the basis for representing\nthe line integral as a change in the flux linkage.\nBecause the free current density is solenoidal, the distribution of free currents within the\nvolume V excluded by the discrete coils can be represented as the superposition of current tubes. From\nEq. 4 and the integral form of Faraday's law, Eq. 2.7.3b with vs = v = 0 (the medium is fixed), it\nfollows that the energy stored in a current tube is\nSwcurrent tube = Jf\" ndS (\nA.-da)\n(5)\nStube\nThe magnetic flux density is also solenoidal4 and fog this reason it is convenient to introduce the mag-\nnetic vector potential A, defined such that B = V x A, so that the magnetic flux density is automatically\nsolenoidal. With this representation of the flux density in terms of the vector potential, Stokes's\ntheorem, Eq. 2.6.3, converts Eq. 5 to\nJf.*ds r\n6~A.ld=\nr\n(\n.6A)dsdk =\nJ f.dAdV\n(6)\nCtube\nCtube\nVtube\nHere, f is by definition in the direction of tn, so that Jf.61 takes the component of 61 in the tn direc-\ntion. The second equality is based upon recognition that the product as-It is a volume element of the\ncurrent tube, and the line integration constitutes an integration over the volume, Vtube , of the tube.\nTo include all of the energy stored in the distributed current loops, it is necessary only that\nSec. 2.14\nXi\n2.27\n\nthe integral on the right in Eq. 6 be extended over all of the volume occupied by the tubes.\nThe combina-\ntion of the incremental energy stored in the discrete loops, Eq. 4, and that from the distributed current\nloops, Eq. 6, is the incremental total energy of the system\nn\n6w = E\nii\ni +\n.6AdV\n(7)\ni=l i\nIn this expression, V is the volume excluded by the discrete current paths.\nThis incremental magnetic\nenergy storage is analogous to that for the electric field storage represented by Eq, 2.13.3.\nIn retrospect, it is apparent from the derivation that the division into discrete and distributed\ncurrent paths, represented by the two terms in Eq. 7,is a matter of convenience. In representing the\nincremental energy in terms of the magnetic fields alone, it is handy to extend the volume V over all\nof the currents within the volume of interest, including those that might be represented by discrete\nterminal pairs. With this understanding, the incremental change in energy, Eq. 7, is the last term\nonly, with V extended over the total volume. Moreover, Ampere's law represents the current density in\nterms of the magnetic field intensity, and, in turn, the integrand can be rewritten by use of a vector\nidentity (Eq. 8, Appendix B):\n6w =\nV x H.6~dV =\n[H.V x\nA + V.(H x 6iA)]dV\n(8)\nV\nV\nThe last term in Eq. 8 can be converted to a surface integral by using Gauss' theorem. With the\nunderstanding that the system is closed in the sense that the fields fall off rapidly enough at infinity\nso that the surface integration can be ignored, the remaining volume integration on the right in Eq. 8\ncan be used to obtain a field representation of the incremental energy change. With the curl of the\nvector potential converted back to a flux density, Eq. 8 becomes\nw =\nHf\nH\nBdv\n(9)\nV\nThe integrand of Eq. 9 is defined as an incremental magnetic energy density\n6W = H.6B\n(10)\nIt is helpful to note the clear analogy between this energy density and the incremental total energy\nrepresented by lumped parameters.\nIn the absence of volume free current densities that cannot be\nrepresented by discrete terminal pairs, Eq. 7 reduces to the lumped parameter form\nn\n6w =\nE\ni.6X.\n(11)\ni=l\nThe magnetic field intensity plays the continuum role of the discrete terminal currents, and the magnetic\nflux density is the continuum analog of the lumped parameter flux linkages.\nThe situation in this mag-\nnetic case is, of course, analogous to the electrical incremental energy storages in continuum and in\nlumped parameter cases, as discussed with Eqs. 7 and 8 of Sec. 2.13.\nJust as it is often convenient in dealing with electrical lumped parameters to use the voltage\nas an independent variable, so also in magnetic field systems it is helpful to use the terminal currents\nas independent variables. In that case, the coenergy function w' is conveniently introduced as an\nenergy function\nn\n6w' = Z X.6i.\n(12)\ni=l\nIn an analogous way, the co-energy density, w', is defined such that\n6W' = B.6H; W' = H.B - W\n(13)\nPower Flow:\nThus far, the storage of energy in magnetic form has been examined. The postulate\nhas been that all work done in moving the charges against an electric field is stored.\nIn any system\nas a whole this is not likely to be the case.\nThe general magnetoquasistatic laws enable a deduction\nof an equation representing the flow of power, and the rate of change of the stored energy. This places\nSdc. 2.14\n2.28\n\nthe energy storage in the context of a more general system.\nA clue as to how an energy conservation statement might be constructed from the differential mag-\nnetoquasistatic laws is obtained from Eq. 2, which makes it clear that the product of the free current\ndensity and the electric field intensity are closely connected with the statement of conservation of\nenergy. The dot product of the electric field and Ampere's law, Eq. 2.3.23b, is\nE.[V x H -\nJf] - 0\n(14)\nUse of a vector identity 6Eq. 8, Appendix B) makes it possible to rewrite this expression as\n+\n4.\n4.\n4.\n4. 4.\nH.V x E -\nV.(E x H) = E.Jf\n(15)\nWith the additional use of Faraday's law to represent V x E, Eq. 15 takes the form of Eq. 2.13.16, with\nS EExH\ne\n4.\nWe -\nH\n(16)\n4+.+\n4.\no\n+\n-E.J - H.\n-\nx (\n.\nMx\n)\nThese quantities have much the same physical significances discussed in connection with Eq. 2.13.16.\nTo place the magnetic energy storage identified with the thermodynamic arguments in the context of\nan actual system, consider a material which is ohmic and fixed so that 4 = 0 and If = C1. Then the\nsecond term on the right in Eq. 16c is in the form of a time rate of change of magnetization energy\ndensity. Hence, the power flow equation assumes the form of Eq. 2.13.17, with\nWE=\nH*6B\n(17)\no\nSE\n= -QE*E\nImplicit is the assumption that H is a single-valued function of the instantaneous B.\nThe resulting\nenergy density includes magnetization energy and is consistent with Eq. 2.14.10.\n2.15 Complex Amplitudes; Fourier.Amplitudes and Fourier Transforms\nThe notion of a continuum network fs introduced for the first time in the next section. The associ-\nated transfer relations illustrated there are a theme throughout the chapters which follow. Among several\nreasons for their use is the organization they lend to the representation of complicated, largely linear,\nsystems. In this chapter, the continuum networks represent electromagnetic fields. Later, they re-\npresent fluid and (to some degree) solid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and electromechanical continua\nin general. These networks make it possible to set aside one part of a given problem, derive the associ-\nated relations once and for all and accumulate these for later use. Such relations will be picked up over\nand over in solving different problems and, properly understood, are a useful reference.\nComplex Amplitudes:\nIn many practical situations, excitations are periodic in one or two spatial\ndirections, in time or in space and time. The complex amplitude representation of fields, useful in\ndealing with these situations, is illustrated by considering the function O(z,t) which has dependence\non z given explicitly by\nO(z,t) = Re y ( t ) e - j k z\n(1)\nWith the wavenumber k real, the spatial distribution is periodic with wavelength X = 2wr/k and spatial\nphase determined by the complex amplitude 1. For example, if\ny\n=\no(t) is real and k is real, then\nO(z,t) =\no0\n0 (t) cos kz.\nThe spatial derivative of 0 follows from Eq. 1 as\nS Re\n(t)e-jkz\n(2)\n7z\nRe.[-JkZ(t)e\n(2\nSecs. 2.14 & 2.15\n2.29\n\nThe following identifications can therefore be made:\nas\nwith it being understood that even though complex amplitudes are being used, the temporal dependence is\narbitrary. There will be occasions where the time dependence is specified, but the space dependence is\nnot.\nFor example, complex amplitudes will take the form\nQ(z,t) = Re4(z)e j wt\n(4)\nwhere D(z) is itself perhaps expressed as a Fourier series or transform (see Sec. 5.16).\nMost.often, complex amplitudes will be used to represent both temporal gnd spatial dependences:\nD(z,t) = Recej(Wt-kz)\n(5)\nThe (angular) frequency w can in general be complex. If 0 is periodic in time with period T, then T =\n2n/w. For complex amplitudes 0, the identifications are:\n[4(z,t),\n(z,t),\n(z,t)]<>[$,-jk(,jj]\n(6)\nIf w and k are real, Eq. 5 represents a traveling wave. At any instant, its wavelength is 2w/k,\nat any position its frequency is w and points of constant phase propagate in the +z direction with the\nphase velocity w/k.\nFourier Amplitudes and Transforms: The relations between complex amplitudes are identical to those\nbetween Fourier amplitudes or between Fourier transforms provided that these are suitably defined. For\na wide range of physical situations it is the spatially periodic response or the temporal sinusoidal\nsteady state that is of interest. Simple combinations of solutions represented by the complex amplitudes\nthen suffice, and there is no need to introduce Fourier concepts. Even so, it is important to recognize\nat the outset that the spatial information required for analysis of excitations with arbitrary spatial\ndistributions is inherent to the transfer relations based on single-complex-amplitude solutions.\nThe Fourier series represents an arbitrary function periodic in z with fundameqtal periodicity\nlength k by a superposition of complex exponentials.\nIn terms of complex Fourier coefficients $n(t),\nsuch a series is\n-jk\nn z\nQ(z,t) =\nE\n(t)e\nk\n2nI/R; Q* =\nn\n(7)\nn\nn\nn\n-n\nwhere the condition on 4n insures that 0 is real. Thus, with the identification\nn\n+ 4n and k + kn, each\ncomplex exponential solution of the form of Eq. 1 can be taken as one term in the Fourier series.\nThe\nmth Fourier amplitude Om follows by multiplying Eq. 7 by the complex conjugate function exp(jkmz) and.\nintegrating over the length k to obtain only one term on the right. This expression can then be solved\nfor ym to obtain the inverse relation\nz+\nJkmz\nim\nOQ(z,t)e\ndz\n(8)\nz\nIf the temporal dependence is also periodic, with fundamental period T, the Fourier series can also\nbe used to represent the time dependence in Eq. 7:\n+i\n+o\nJ wmt-knz)\nO(z,t)=\nE\nE\ne\n;\n*\n= 8\n(9)\nmn\nmn\n-m-n\nm=--\nn=--\nwhere the condition on the amplitudes insures that O(z,t) is real. One component out of this double sum-\nmation is the traveling-wave solution represented by the complex amplitude form, Eq. 5. The rules given\nby Eqs. 3 and 6 pertain either to the complex amplitudes or the Fourier coefficients.\nThe Fourier transform is convenient if the dependence is not periodic.

Recall that fvdu = uv - fudv and identify\ndu -+ O/azdz and v -\nexp jkz, and it follows that\nS-\nkz dz =\nejk-C -jk +\nejkz dz\n(12)\nFor properly bounded functions the first term on the right vanishes and the second is -jki(k,t).\nThe\ntransform of Ha/Dz is simply -jkl and thus the Fourier transform also follows the rules given with\nEq. 3.\nExtension of the Fourier transform to a second dimension results in the transform pair\nj(ot-ks) dk dw\n0(z,t) =\n0 $(k, w)eJ(t-kz)\n2dk\nd2w\n(13)\nA\n+|\n-j (,t-kz) dt dz\nJ(k,w)\n=\nf\n(z,t)e - j (tkz)dt dz\nwhich illustrates how the traveling-wave solution of Eq. 5 can be viewed as a component of a complicated\nfunction. Again, relations between complex amplitudes are governed by the same rules, Eq. 6, as are the\nFourier amplitudes $(k,w).\nIf relationships are found among quantities $(t), then the same relations hold with c + $ and\nD( )/Bt -÷ jw, because the time dependence exp(jwt)is a particular case of the more general form $(t).\nAverages of Periodic Functions: An identity often used to evaluate temporal or spatial averages of\ncomplex-amplitude expressions is\nRe\nekz Re Bej\n= 1 Re A B*\n(14)\n/z\nwhere ( )zsignifies an average over the length 2w/k and it is assumed that k is real.

Surfaces enclosing these regions are often planar, cylindrical or\nspherical, with the volume then taking the form of a planar layer, a cylindrical annulus or a spherical\nshell. Such volumes and bounding surfaces are illustrated in Tables 2.16.1-3. The question answered\nin this section is: given the potential on the bounding surfaces, what are the associated normal flux\ndensities? Of immediate interest is the relation of the electric potentials to the normal displace-\nment vectors. But also treated in this section is the relation of the magnetic potential to the normal\nmagnetic flux densities. First the electroquasistatic fields are considered, and then the magnetoquasi-\nstatic relations follow by analogy.\nElectric Fields:\nIf any one of the regions shown in Tables 2.16.1-3 is filled with insulating\ncharge-free (pf\nO) material of uniform permittivity e,\nS(-\n)E,\nD =\nE\n(1)\nthe governing field equations are Gauss' law, Eq. 2.3.23a,\nV*D = 0\n(2)\nand the condition that E be irrotational, Eq. 2.3.24a.

That\nthe potentials at the a and $ surfaces can be quite general follows from the discussion of Sec. 2.15,\nwhich shows that the following arguments apply when I is a spatial Fourier amplitude or a Fourier trans-\nform.\nIn view of the surface potential distributions, solutions to Eq. 4 are assumed to take the form\nS=-Re O(x,t) exp[-j(kyy + kzz)]\n(12)\nSubstitution shows that\nd2\n2 = 0; y =Vk2 + k2\n(13)\ndx2\ny\nz\n+yx\nSolutions of this equation are linear combinations of e\nor alternatively of sinh yx and cosh yx.\nWith ~i and 12 arbitrary functions of time, the solution teakes the form\n0$1 sinh yx + 02 cosh yx\n(14)\nThe two coefficients are determined by requiring that the conditions of Eq. 11 be satisfied. For the sim-\nple situation at hand, an instructive alternative to performing the algebra necessary to evaluate (01,02)\nconsists in recognizing that a linear combination of the two solutions in Eq. 14 is sinh y(x - A).\nThus,\nthe solution can be written as the sum of solutions that are individually zero on one or the other of the\nbounding surfaces.

Similarly, evaluated at x = 0, Eq. 16\nives D5. The components of the \"flux\" (Nij ) are\nnow determined, given the respective potentials (ci ,B).\nThe transfer relations, Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1,\nsummarize what is found. These relations can be solved for any pair of variables as a function of the\nremaining pair. The inverse transfer relations are also summarized for reference in Table 2.16.1, Eq.

For a two-terminal-pair system, Eq. 2.11.5 comprises two terminal char es\n(ql,q2) expressed as linear functions of the terminal voltages (vl,V2). Analogously, the (D,,Dx)\n(which have units of charge per unit area and an arbitrary time dependence) are given as linear func-\ntions of the potentials by Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1. A similar analogy exists between Eq. 2.12.5,\nexpressing (X1 ,X2 ) as functions of (il,i 2), and the transfer relations between (B ,BO) (units of flux\nper unit area) and the magnetic potentials (TYa,P).\nAccording to Eq. (a) of Table 2.16.1, Dx is induced by a \"self term\" (proportional to the potential\nat the same surface) and a \"mutual term.\"\nThe coefficients which express this self- and mutual-coupling\nhave a dependence on ay (2r/y the wavelength in the y-z plane) shown in Fig. 2.16.1a. Written in the\nform of Eq. 15, the potential has components, excited at each surface, that decay to zero, as shown in\nFig. 2.16.1b, at a rate that is proportional to how rapidly the fields vary in the y-z plane. For long\nwaves the decay is relatively slow, as depicted by the case Ay = 0.5, and the mutual-field is almost as\ngreat as the self field. But as the wavelength is shortened relative to A (Ay increased), the surfaces\ncouple less and less.\nIn this discussion it is assumed that y is real, which it is if ky and kz are real.\nIn fact, the\ntransfer relations are valid and useful for complex values of (ky,kz).\nIf these numbers are purely\nimaginary, the field distributions over the layer cross section are periodic. Such solutions are needed\nto satisfy boundary conditions imposed in an x-y plane.\nCylindrical Annulus: With the bounding surfaces coaxial cylinders having radii a and B, it is\nnatural to use cylindrical coordinates (r, 0, z).\nA cross section of this prototype region and the\ncoordinates are shown in Table 2.16.2.\nOn the outer and inner surfaces, the potential has the respec\ntive forms\no(a,e,z,t) = Re P (t) e- j(me+kz);\n0(B,0,z,t) = Re ~ (t)e-j(me+kz)\n(17)\nHence, it is appropriate to assume a bulk potential\n( = Re y(r,t)e -j(me+kz)\n(18)\nSubstitution in Laplace's equation (see Appendix A for operations in cylindrical coordinates), Eq. 4,\nthen shows that\nd\n1 d@\nm\n(19)\n+ -\n-\n(k\n+\n-)\n(19)\ndr 2\nr dr\ndr\nr\nBy contrast with Eq. 13, this one has space-varying coefficients.\nIt is convenient to categorize the\nsolutions according to the values of (m,k).

Inversion of these relations, to give the surface potentials as functions of\nthe surface displacements, results in the relations summarized by Eq. (b) of that table.

The self-field coefficients fm(O,a) and fm(o,8) are sketched for m=0O and m=l in\nFig. 2.16.2b.

In terms of the\nLegendre polynomials Pn, these functions are summarized in Table 2.16.3. Note that these solutions are\nclosed. They do not require infinite series for their representation.\nTo the second order differential equation, Eq. 33, there must be a second set of solutions Q.\nBecause these are singular in the interval 0 4 e < 7 , and situations of interest here include the\nentire spherical surface at any given radius, these solutions are not included. The functions Pm play\nthe role of exp(jkz)(say) in cylindrical geometry, while exp(jmo) is analogous to exp(jmO).\nThe radial\ndependence, which is much of the bother in cylindrical coordinates, is actually quite simple in spherical\ncoordinates. From Eq. 31b it is seen that solutions are a linear combination of rn and r-(n+l).

The horizontal register of each diagram is\ndetermined by the complex amplitude, which determines the phase of exp(jmo).\nEvaluation of the transfer relations given in Table 2.16.3 by Eqs. (a) and (b) is now carried out\nfollowing the same procedure as for the planar layer. From these relations follow the limiting situ-\nations of a solid spherical region or one where the outer surface is well removed from the region of\ninterest summarized for reference by Eqs.

The remaining integral is converted to a surface integral by\nGauss' theorem, and the equation reduces to\ndw = -\n066.nda\n(2)\nS\nSimilar arguments apply in the magnetic cases. Because there is no volume free current density,\nH = -VT\nand Eq. 2.14.9 becomes\n6w = -\nd'B'nda\n(3)\nS\nConsider now the implications of these last two expressions for the transfer relations derived in\nSec. 2.16. Discussion is in terms of the electrical relations, but the analogy made in Sec. 2.16 clearl1\npertains as well to Eqs. 2 and 3, so that the arguments also apply to the magnetic transfer relations.\nSuppose that the increment of energy 6w is introduced through S to a volume bounded by sections of\nthe a and B surfaces extending one \"wavelength\" in the surface dimensions. In Cartesian coordinates,\n5. F. B. Hildebrand, loc. cit., pp. 159-165.\nSecs. 2.16 & 2.17\n2.40\n\nthis volume is bounded by (y,z) surfaces extending one wavelength in the y and z directions. In cylin-\ndrical coordinates, the volume is a pie-shaped cylinder subtended by outside and inside surfaces having\nlength 2w/k in the z direction and 2wa/m and 2rB/m respectively in the azimuthal direction. In spherical\ncoordinates, the volume is a sector from a sphere with 0 = 2w/m radians along the equator, 6 extending\nfrom 0 + w and the surfaces at r = a and r = 8.\nIn any of these cases, conservation of energy, as\nexpressed by Eq. 2, requires that\n6w = -aaKKa6D\n+ a\n0B6D8\n(4)\nThe ( )> indicate averages over the respective surfaces of excitation.

Not only does this reduce the vector field to a scalar field, but the potential function\nevaluated on such surfaces as those of \"perfectly\" conducting electrodes becomes a lumped parameter\nterminal variable, e.g., the voltage.\nSolenoidal fields, such as the magnetic flux density B, are for similar reasons sometimes re-\npresented in terms of a vector potential A:\n+\n+\nThus, B automatically has no divergence. Unfortunately, the vector field B is represented in terms of\nanother vectox field A. However, for important two-dimensional or symmetric configurations, a single\ncomponent of A is all required to again reduce the description to one involving a scalar function.\nFour commonly encountered cases are summarized in-Table 2.18.1.\nThe first two are two-dimensional in the usual sense. The field B lies in the x-y (or r-8) plane\nand depends only on these coordinates. The associated vector potential has only a z component. The\nthird configuration, l1ke the second, is in cylindrical geometry, but with B independent of e and hence\nwith A having only an i0 component. The fourth configuration is in spherical geometry with symmetry\nabout the z axis and the vector potential directed along 0..\nLike the scalar potential used to represent irrotational fields, the vector potential is closely\nrelated to lumped parameter variables. If B is the magnetic flux density, i4 is convenient for evalua-\ntion of tje flux linkage X (Eq. 2.12.1).\nFor an incompressible flow, where B is replaced by the fluid\nvelocity v, the vector potential is conveniently used to evaluate the volume rate of flow. In that\napplication, A and A become \"stream functions.\"\nThe connection between the flux linked and the vector potential follows from Stokes's theorem,\nEq. 2.6.3. The flux 1X through a surface S enclosed by a contour C is\n0= f 1da =\na\nV x -tnda=\n1d-\n(2)\nS\nS\nC\nIn each of the configurations of Table 2.18.1, Eq. 2 amounts to an evaluation of the surface integral.\nFor example, in the Cartesian two-dimensional configuration, contributions to the integration around a\ncontour C enclosing a surface having length 2 in the z direction, only come from the legs running in\nthe a direction. Along these portions of the contour, denoted by (a) and (b), the coordinates (x,y) are\nconstant. Hence, the flux through the surface is simply 2 times the difference A(a) - A(b), as sum-\nmarized in Table 2.18.1.\nIn the axisymmetric cylindrical and spherical configurations, r and r sin 6 dependences are\nrespectively introduced, so that evaluation of A essentially gives the flux linked. For example, in\nthe spherical configuration, the flux linked by a surface having inner and outer radii r cos 0 evaluated\nat (a) and (b) is simply\nSA(,rsin e\n.d=\nr sin e 2(r\nsin e)b = 2rI[A(a) -\nA(b)]\n(3)\nC\nUsed in fluid mechanics to represent incompressible fluid flow, A is the Stokel's stream function.

By\nappropriate identification of variables, the same relations can be used to describe different regions.\nAs an example, three planar regions are shown in\nFig. 2.20.1. The symbols in parentheses denote positions\nadjacent to the surfaces demarking subregions. At the\nsurfaces, variables can be discontinuous. Hence it is\nnecessary to distinguish variables evaluated on adjacent\nsides of a boundary. The transfer relations describe\nthe fields within the subregions and not across the\nboundaries.\nThe transfer relations of Table 2.16.1 can be\napplied to the upper region by identifying (a)+ (d),\n(0) + (e), A + a and s or P -\nEa or Pa.

Once the surface variables have\nbeen self-consistently determined, the field distributions within the region can be evaluated using the\nbulk distributions evaluated in terms of the surface coefficients. With appropriate surface amplitudes\nand x + x', where the latter is defined for each region in Fig. 2.20.1, Eq. 2.16.15 describes the\npotential distribution.\nThis approach will be used not only in other geometries but in representing mechanical and\nelectromechanical processes.\nSec. 2.20\n2.46"

It is common to speak of the \"force on a charge\" or the \"force on a current\"\neven though what is meant is the force on ponderable material. Interest might actually be in electric\nand magnetic forces acting on collections of fundamental charge carriers.\n(Motions of electron beams in\nvacuum are an example. The charged particles in that case constitute the continuum, in the sense that\nit is the electron inertia that enters into the equation of motion.)\nBut, more commonly, the charged\nparticles are imbedded in media, and it is the resulting force on the material that is of interest.\nExamples are as obvious as the electrical force of attraction between the capacitor plates of an electro-\nstatic voltmeter or the magnetic torque exerted on current-carrying conductors in a meter movement.\nSection 3.2 develops a specific model to illustrate how momentum imparted to charged particles by\nthe fields is transferred to the neutral media that support those particles. That macroscopic forces\nare more than simply an average over the forces on fundamental charges is further emphasized by consider-\ning the practical cases of polarization and magnetization forces. Force densities of engineering signifi-\ncance exist even in regions where the free charge and free current (and for that matter polarization\ncharge or magnetization charge) are absent. Such forces can be associated with a microscopic picture,\ndiscussed in Sec. 3.6, in which electrical forces on dipoles are transferred to the media.\nAlthough the dipole model is useful for forming a microscopic picture of electric polarization\nforces, it is restricted to cases where the dipoles do not significantly interact. In the pursuit of\na less restricted force density, developments in Secs. 3.7-3.8 are based on such measured macroscopic\nparameters as the permittivity and permeability. It is the business of thermodynamics to convert that\ninformation into the desired force densities.\nIn its own way, the line of reasoning presented in\nSecs. 3.5, 3.7 and 3.8 exemplifies a more basic point of view than one geared to a particular microscopic\nmodel. Thermodynamic concepts provide a means for replacing detailed and specialized derivations by\ncarefully defined physical measurements.\nThe stress-tensor representation of electromagnetic forces which concludes this chapter will see\ncontinual application in the following chapters. The tensor concept itself, introduced in Sec. 3.9,\nwill also be applied to the formulation of continuum mechanical and electromechanical equations.\n3.2\nThe Lorentz Force Density\nAlthough macroscopic forces were the first measured in the development of electricity and mag-\nnetism, it is now normally accepted that the fundamental force is that on a \"test\" charge. This charge\nmight be a jingle electron in free space. If the charged particle has a total charge q and moves with\na velocity vp, then the Lorentz force acting on the particle supporting the charge is\n= qE + qvp x\no H\n(1)\nThis statement, like the electrodynamic laws summarized in Chap. 2, is an empirical one. In most of the\nareas of continuum electromechanics, it is forces due to many charges that are of interest, and it is\ntherefore appropriate to sum the individual forces of Eq. 1 over the charges within a given unit of\nvolume to arrive at the Lorentz force density\nF = pfE + Jf x oH\n(2)\nIncremental volumes of interest have dimensions much greater than the characteristic distances between\nparticles. But also,\nfor the average electrical field to have meaning, it must be primarily due\nto sources external to the differential volume of interest. This ensures that, over an incremental\nvolume, each particle experiences essentially the same electric field. The contribution to the field\nof the charges within the differential volume is negligible. Similar arguments apply to the magnetic\nfield intensity, which must be produced over a given differential volume largely by currents outside\nthe volume.\nEquation 2 represents the force density acting on a ponderable medium if means are available for\nthe force on the particles to be transmitted to the medium. The mechanisms by which this happens are\ndiverse, and implicit to the conduction process. Whether the fundamental carriers are electrons in a\nmetal, holes and electrons in a semiconductor or ions in a liquid or gas, the average motions of\nfundamental charge carriers are superimposed on random motions. The flights of fundamental carriers\nare interrupted by collisions with lattice molecules (in a solid) or molecules that are themselves in\na Brownian equilibrium (in a liquid or gas) with a frequency that is usually extremely high compared\nto reciprocal times of interest. These collisions transfer momentum from the fundamental charge\ncarriers to the ponderable medium.\nSecs. 3.1 & 3.2\n\nTo more fully appreciate the transition from the force acting on fundamental carriers, Eq. 1, to\nthat on a material, Eq. 2, it is helpful to make a formal derivation. Although the discussion leads\nto rather general conclusions, only two families of carriers are now considered, one positive with\ncharge per particle q~and number density n+ and the other negative with a magnitude of charge q_ and\nnumber density n_. The average Lorentz force, Eq. 1, is in equilibrium with an average force repre-\nsenting the effect of collisions on the net migration of the particles:\nqE + q_(v_ + v) x U°H . m__\nq\n-\nq(v + v) x\nmVv\nThe retarding forces on the right are much as would be conceived for a swarm of macroscopic particles\nmoving through a viscous liquid. The average carrier velocities -+ are measured relative to the medium\nwhich itself has the velocity V. Hence, on the right it is relative velocities of particles and medium\nthat appear, while in the Lorentz force it is total particle velocities that are appropriate. The co-\nefficients for the collisional forces are written as the product of the particle masses m± and collisi\nfrequencies v+ as a matter of convention. Note that the inertial force on the carriers is ignored com-\npared to that due to collisions. This approximation would be invalidated in a plasma if the frequency\nof an applied electric field intensity were extremely high. But, in many conductors and certainly in t\nmost usual electromechanical situations, the inertial effects of the charge carriers can be ignored (se\n(Problem 3.3.1.).\nThe charge density and current density are written in terms of the microscopic variables as\nPf = nq -\nn_q_\n(4)\nJ f - n+q+(v+ + v) -\nn q_(v_ + v)\n(5)\n+\n+ 4.\n+\n= n+q+v+ -\nn_q_v_ +\nfv\nThe average force density acting on the ponderable medium is the sum of the right-hand sides of Eq. 3,\nrespectively, multiplied by the particle densities n+:\nF = n+m+v+\n+ n m Vv\n(6)\nThe point in writing this equation is to formalize the statement that, through some collisional process,\nthe force on the fundamental carriers becomes the force on the medium. It is evident from the next\nstep that, at least in so far as the Lorentz force density is concerned, the details of the collisional\nequilibrium are not important. The left-hand sides of Eq. 3 (regardless, for example, of whether m+v+\nare functions of v+ or are constant) are substituted for the respective terms in Eq. 6 to obtain\nF -\n(nq - nq)E\n+ [(n q v\n-\nn_q_v_) + (nq\n-\nn_q_)v] x PoH\n(7)\nIn view of the definitions given by Eqs. 4 and 5, this expression is the Lorentz force density of Eq. 2\nIts validity hinges on there being an instantaneous equilibrium between the forces on the fundamental\ncarriers and the \"collisions\" with the ponderable medium, but not on the details of that interaction.\n3.3 Conduction\nThere are three objectives in this section. The first is to have a microscopic picture of the\ncarrier motions to associate with ohmic or unipolar conduction models. The second is to illustrate\nhow constitutive laws for media in motion can be derived from models based on particular microscopic\nmodels, or (on the basis of the field transformations) found by generalizing empirically determined\nlaws established in the laboratory for materials at rest. Finally, a byproduct of the discussion\nis an introduction to Hall effect.\nConsider the carrier motions represented by Eqs. 3.2.3, with the magnetic field H - H i ex-\nternally imposed. The components of these equations then respectively become\nvx+\n+b+ Ex\n4t b+H\nv\nM\n+b E\no\n+ b+ v zoHo\n(1)\n+b+ 1oH\nvZ+\n+b+Ez + b+V yoH\n,\non\nhe\ne\n.\nSecs. 3.2 & 3.3\n\nwhere particle mobilities are defined as b+ = q+/m+y+.\nThese three equations can be inverted to find the relative carrier velocities in terms of (EH,_):\n~1\n+b+\nVx+\n-0\n+0\nE\n+\n-r\nv ±\n+b\nb+\noHo\nEy + Vz H\n(2)\nVy+\n+\n-b+o H\n+b\nE\n+\nz - v\ny\nH\nVz+\no o\n-+\nz\nyoo\nwhere A = 1 +.(o H b ) 2\nThese velocity components can now be introduced into Eq. 3.2.5 to express the free current density\nas\n4- q 4 bs+ nq b\nf\n+\nJ\n(\n+\n- -\nx -\nIU J\nn\nnA +\n(EAi\n+ Ei5 )\n\\\n+\nf\n(3)\nb2\nn_q\nqb2\nA(n\nwhere E'\nE + v x POH is the electric field in a frame of reference moving with the material (for a\nmagnetoquasistatic system).\nFrom Eq. 3, it is clear that there are two components to the current density, one in the direc-\ntion of the imposed electric field and the second perpendicular to it. The latter term is called the\nHall current and is due to the tendency of the particles to move perpendicular to their own velocity\nand to the imposed magnetic field intensity. This last term is ignorable if\nioHob+ << 1\n(4)\nA typical magnetic flux density is poH = 1 (10,000 gauss, which is in the range where magnetic mate-\nrials saturate). Electrons in copper Rave a mobility on the order of 3 x 10-3 m2/volt sec, so that\nthe parameter on the left is then much less than 1. Ions in liquids have mobilities that are typically\n5 x 10-8 m2 /volt sec and the approximation is even better. But in silicon or germanium, where the\nelectron mobility is in the range of 10-1 m2/volt sec, the Hall effect is coming into play by the time\npoHo is of the order of unity. With the inequality of Eq. 4 satisfied, Eq. 3 reduces to the familiar\nform\n~ = (nq+b+ + n qb)' + pf\n(5)\nIf the number density of charge carriers n+ and/or n_ remains essentially the same in spite of the\napplication of E, then the factor multiplying I in Eq. 5 is usefully regarded as a parameter character-\nizing the material, the electrical conductivity a.\nThis case of ohmic conduction is displayed by mate-\nrials ranging from metallic conductors, where the carriers are electrons and essentially immobile ions,\nto electrolytes, where ions of at least two species participate in the conduction. In any of these\ncases, for the ohmic model to be valid, the conduction must involve at least two species with both\nn+q+ and n.q. greatly exceeding the net charge pf.\nBy introducing the conductivity as a parameter,\nthe detailed analysis necessary to determine the self-consistent distributions of the individual\ncarriers is avoided. But to examine the conditions under which the conductivity model is valid, it\nis necessary to formulate the laws that govern the self-consistent carrier motions. This is best done\nin the context of molecular diffusion (Chap. 10) so that other important limitations on the model can\nalso be identified.\nEven though in accounting for conduction it is useful to have in mind microscopic mechanisms, it\nis also important to recognize the far-reaching implications of empirical relations. Given any con-\nduction law based on laboratory measurements made with a fixed sample, effects of material motion can\nbe brought in by using the transformation laws. For example, if it is known that the conductor obeys\nOhm's law when stationary, then in a primed inertial frame moving with the velocity _ of the conductor,\nthe experiment shows that\nJf4\n-E'\n(6)\nIn an electroquasistatic system, including polarization, Jf = Jf -\npfv (Eq. 2.5.12a) and E' - E\n(Eq. 2.5.9a). Hence, Eq. 6 becomes Eq. 5. In a magnetoquasistatic system, including magnetization,\nSec. 3.3\n\n4.+\n+\n+\nJ;\nJ (Eq. 2.5.11b) and E\nE + v x\nH (Eq. 2.5.12b).\nSubstitution in Eq. 6 now gives Eq. 5, except\nfor the charge convection term pf0. In a magnetoquasistatic system, this term is second-order, as will\nbe argued in the next section.\nFundamental to the use of an empirical law determined for the stationary material is the assump-\ntion that material acceleration and deformation do not influence the conduction. In any case, if\nacceleration did effect the conduction, the close tie between conduction and the Lorentz force density,\nillustrated in this and the previous section, calls into question the notion that the electromechanics\ncan be modeled by a single continuum subject to the Lorentz force density.\n3.4 quasistatic Force Density\nThe Lorentz force density, Eq. 3.2.2, is composed of what will be termed, respectively, an elec-\ntric force density and a magnetic force density\n+\n4.\n+\nF = PfE + Jf x oH\n(1)\nIt is found in a wide range of applications that the force density is predominantly one or the other\nof these contributions. Polarization and magnetization force densities, not included in Eq. 1, are\nsimilarly identified with the respective quasistatic systems. In this section, dimensional arguments\nare given that demonstrate that the electric force density generally dominates in electroquasistatic\nsystems, while the magnetic force density dominates in magnetoquasistatic systems.\nThe line of reasoning is an extension of that introduced in Sec. 2.2.\nThe force density is\nnormalized in accordance with Eq. 2.3.4 and the free current density is represented as having the\nform of Eq. 2.3.1. Thus,\n2-+- E\nHE\n2.\n(2)\nS\n[p\nE + -M\na -\ntJx\nJ)\ni\nEQS\n(2)\n+\no 2em\nF\n)2 f E + (\nT+ E + J)\n4+1 x H\n]+\nMQS\nQS\n(2)\nThe relative values of the time constants are summarized by Fig. 2.3.1. In the electroquasi-\nstatic system, T /T<< 1 and TmT /T2 = (em /) 2 << 1. Hence, the free charge density term is zero-\norder in Eq. 1, and the magnetic term is consistently ignoredl In the magnetoquasistatic force\ndensity of Eq. 3, (Tem/T)2 << 1, and the free charge force density is negligible compared to the mag-\nnetic term. Hence, the second term of Eq. 1 is used to the exclusion of the first in magnetoquasi-\nstatic systems.\n3.5 Thermodynamics of Discrete Electromechanical Coupling\nIn this section, the thermodynamic electric and magnetic energy storage subsystems are expanded\nto include the possibility of a finite number of discrete mechanical displacements of macroscopic\nmaterial. .Based on the notion of an energy function and a thermodynamic equilibrium, the force of\nelectrical origin associated with each of these displacements is determined. Typically, the method\nexploits a knowledge of the electrical terminal relations to determine the forces.\nThe approach\nis generalized in Secs. 3.7 and 3.8, where constitutive laws are the basis for finding the force\ndensity of electric origin. Except for mathematical manipulations, the derivations now reviewed draw\nupon all of the demanding issues confronted later in deriving force densities.\nElectroquasistatic Coupling: An example of a lumped-parameter electroquasistatic system is given\nwith Fig. 2.11.1, including a schematic representation of a finite number of mechanical displacements.\nAssociated with each of the displacements is an electromechanical force tending to displace a lumped\nelement by an amount 6 1i\"\nConservation of energy for the system with the geometry fixed is expressed by Eq. 2.13.8. Now,\nan incremental increase in the total energy caused by placing an increment of charge qi on an electrode\nhaving the voltage vi can be diminished by an amount equal to the work done on the external environ-\nment by the forces of electrical origin acting through the displacements of the associated mechanical\nentities. Thus, energy'conservation requires that\nn\nm\n6w =i= E\ndqi - jZ\nfj 6\n;\nw = w(ql.q n'gl...m)\n9(1)\ni=1\nj=1\n1. Electrons in vacuum can have a velocity approaching that of light.\nIn that case an imposed mag-\nnetic field can have a crucial effect on the EQS dynamics (See Sec. 11.2).\nSecs. 3.3, 3.4 & 3.5\n\nGiven the charges ql...qn and the displacement E1\"' m as independent variables, the energy function\nis uniquely determined. The \"displacements\" should be recognized as generalized variables in that they\ncould just as well be angular deflections, in which case the associated \"forces\" would be torques.\nTo determine w, constitutive relations vi(ql... * qnnl\"'En)\nmust be known so that Eq. 1 can be\nintegrated. The integration is a line integral in a state-space composed of the independent variables.\nBecause the fj's are not known, and are defined as equal to zero in the absence of electrical excita-\ntions, integration on the mechanical variables (j is carried out first. This gives no contribution\nbecause as the displacements are brought to their final values, fj = 0 (no work is required to assemble\nthe system with the qj's = 0).\nThen, the integration on successive electrical variables is carried\nout, first on ql with all other qj's = 0, then on q2 with ql at its final value and all others zero,\netc. Formally, the integration of Eq. 1 gives\nn\nq\nw = Zf v (ql*1\n*,0..0,\n.m)6\n1l'\nj\n(2)\no\nJ=l1\nBecause the energy function is a state function specified by the independent variables, an incre-\nmental change in the total energy can also be written as\nn\nm\n6w =\nw\naw\n~ ilw\nqi\n6 q i\n+\nE\nj\n(3)\nIf the q's and the V's are independent variables in the sense that Eqs. 1 and 3 hold for arbitrary\ncombinations of incremental changes in these electrical and mechanical variables, then\naw\naw\nvi =\nfj =-' r\n(4)\nNote that the q's and C's are not necessarily independent of each other unless the system is isolated\nfrom the total system in which it is imbedded. Given w from Eq. 2, the electrical forces are determined.\nA consequence of the conservation of energy expressed by Eq. 1 is the reciprocity condition between\npairs of terminal variables. For example, derivatives of Eq. 4a, first with respect to qj and then of\nthe same equation but with i replaced by j, and with respect to qi, are related by\nav\nav\ni\nj\n(5)\nSqj m\niq qj\naqi\nOther reciprocity conditions follow from Eq. 4 by taking cross-derivatives to relate forces and volt-\nages to each other.\nIn dealing with practical lumped-parameter systems, it is often convenient to use the voltages\nrather than the charges as independent variables.

Similarly, the force can be found from the coenergy function by taking the derivative with\nrespect to the associated displacement with the other displacements and the currents held constant.\n3.6 Polarization and Magnetization Force Densities on Tenuous Dipoles\nForces due to polarization and magnetization lend further emphasis to the importance of making a\ndistinction between forces on microscopic charged particles and macroscopic forces on materials sup-\nporting those charges. The experiment depicted by Fig. 3.6.1 makes it clear that (1) there is more\nto the force density than accounted for by the Lorentz 4orce\ndensity, and (2) the additional force density is not p E (or\nin the magnetic analogue, PmH).\nA pair of capacitor plates are dipped into a dielectric\nliquid. With the application of a potential difference v, it\nX\nis found experimentally that the liquid rises between the\nplates.*\nTo make it clear that the issues involved can be\nunderstood in terms of lumped-parameter concepts, the liquid\nbetween the plates is replaced by a solid dielectric material\nhaving the same polarizability as the liquid, so that the\n-z-\nproblem is reduced to one of a solid dielectric slab rising\nbetween the plates as it is pulled from the liquid below.\na\nRecall that if the interface is well removed from the\nw into\nedges of the plates, an exact solution satisfying the quasi-\npaper\nstatic differential equations and boundary conditions in the\nneighborhood of the interface is E = (v/d)iz. Of course,\nthere is a fringing field in the neighborhood of the edges\n. . .\n.\n7 1.\"1\nof the capacitor plates.

However, everywhere in the dielec-\n:....\ntric bulk the polarization density is proportional by the\nsame constant to the electric field (Eq. 2.16.1).\nBcause\nFig. 3.6.1. Experiment demonstrating\nPf = 0, it follows from Gauss' law that E and hence P have\nthe existence of polarization\nno divergence, and so there is also no polarization charge\nforces that are not explicable\nin the dielectric. Furthermore, because the electric field\nin terms of forces on single\nis uniform and tangential to the interface, there is not even\ncharges.\na polarization surface charge density at the interface\n(Eq. 2.10.21).\nThroughout the dielectric, on the interface and in the bulk, there is no polarization\ncharge. Clearly, the force which makes the dielectric rise between the plates cannot be accounted for\nby a polarization charge density.\nIn an experiment, a-c voltage is used with a sufficiently high frequency that the material responds\nonly to the rms field and free charge cannot accumulate in the bulk.\nSecs. 3.5 & 3.6\n\nIf the polarized material is composed of individual dipoles, each\nsubject to an electrical force, and each transmitting this electrical\nforce to the neutral medium, it is clear that there is really no reason\nto expect that the force density should take the same form as that for\nfree charges. With free charges, it is the individual charges that\ntransmit their forces to the neutral medium through mechanisms dis-\ncussed in Sec. 3.2. Now concern is with the force on individual dipoles\nwhich transmit that force to the neutral medium, either because they are\ntied to a lattice structure (Fig. 2.8.1) or through collisional mecha-\nnisms similar to those discussed for charge carriers in Sec. 3.2.\nIn the following. it is assumed that the dipoles are subject to\nan electric field that is the average, or macroscopic, electric field.\n'Z\nThe development ignores the distortion of the electric field intensity\nat one dipole because of the neighboring dipoles. For this reason,\nFig. 3.6.2. Definition of dis-\nthe result is designated a force density acting on tenuous dipoles.\nplacement and charge loca-\ntions for dipole.\nA single dipole is shown in Fig. 3.6.2. The dipole can be picqured\nas a pair of oppositely signed charges having the vector separation d. The negative charge is located\nat r. With the assumption that the force on the dipole is transmitted to the medium, the procedure\nis to compute the force on a single dipole, and then to average this force over all the dipoles. The\nnet force in the ith direction on the pair of charges taken as a unit is\nfi\nim q[E (\n+\n) - Ei(r)]\n(2)\nd-O\nThe limit is one in which the spacing of the charges becomes extremely small compared to other distances\no4 interest and, at the same time, the magnitude of the charges becomes very large, so that the product\nSqd remains finite. The dipole moment is defined as ;. The required limit of Eq. 2 becomes\nBE\nE\nfi\nimd q[Ei~()\n+\ndJ - Ei)] -\nj ax\n(3)\nThus, there is a net force on each dipole given in vector notation by\n)VE\n(4)\nyot$ that implicit to this vector representation is the definition of what is meant by the operator\nA.VB\nBy assumption, the net force on each dipole is transmitted to the macroscopic medium and it is\nappropriate then to think of averaging these polarization forces over all dipoles within the medium.\nIn general, this average would have to be taken with recognition that the microscopic dipoles could\nassume a spectrum of polarizations in a given electric field intensity. For present purposes, the\naverage can simply be represented as the multiplication of Eq. 4 by the number of dipoles, n, per unit\nvolume. With the definition of the polarization density as P -\nnp, the Kelvin polarization force\ndensity is found:\nF = .V\n(5)\nCan the force density given by Eq. 5 be used to explain the rise of the dielectric between the\nplates in Fig. 3.6.1? Certainly, there is no force density in material regions of uniform electric\nfield, because then the -spatial derivatives called for with Eq. 5 vanish. However, in the fringing\nfield at the lower edges of the plates, the electric field intensity does vary rapidly. In that region,\nthe permittivity is a constant, and for a linear dielectric, where D = El, Eq. 5 becomes [in dealing\nwith vectors and tensors, a term in which a subscript appears twice is to be summed 1 to 3 (unless\notherwise indicated)]\nBE\nBE\n,\n-\nEi\nE\na\n1(-\n(6\nFi\n( - e)E\no\nj\n(P - S)E\nxi\n(E - Eo)\n(\nE)\n(6)\nwhere the irrotational nature of E is exploited, aEi/axj -\naEj/axi. In vector notation, Eq. 6 becomes\nF = V\n(c - e )E.El\n(7)\nSec. 3.6\n\nRemember, this relation pertains only to regions of a linear dielectric in which the permittivity is\nconstant, and is simply a means of visualizing the distribution of the Kelvin force density. In such\nregions, the force density has the direction of maximum rate of increase of the electric energy storage.\nTypical force vectors, sketched in Fig. 3.6.1, tend to push the dielectric upward between the plates.\nIt 4s important not to overgeneralize from Eq. 7. In any configuration in which there is a component\nof E perpendicular to an interface, there is a singular component of the Kelvin force density acting at\nthe interface -- a surface force density. Such a component would be incorrectly inferred from Eq. 7,\nwhich is not valid through the interfacial region.\nConsider now the force density acting on a continuum of dilute magnetic dipoles that, like the\nanalogous electric dipoles just considered, pass along a force of electric origin to a macroscopic\nmedium via collisions or lattice constraints. It is not possible to use the Lorentz force law as a\nstarting point unless magnetic monopoles and an analogous force law on these magnetic \"charges\" is\npostulated. Without introducing such notions, the Kelvin magnetization force density can be deduced\nas follows.\nElectroquasistatic and magnetoquasistatic systems are piStured abstractly in Fig. 3.6.3. A volume\nenclosing the region occupied by a dipole having the position 5 has a surface S and includes neither\nfree charge in the EQS system nor free current in the MQS system. Hence the fields are governed by\nFig. 3.6.3a. EQS system\nFig. 3.6.3b. MQS system\nVx E = 0; E = -V\nVx H\n0; H = -VY\n(8)\no+\nV*(EcoE + P) = 0; P = np\nV.(0oH + 1oM ) = O; M f nm\n(9)\nStatements that the input of electric energy either goes into increasing the total energy stored or in-\nto doing work on the dipoles are (see Eqs. 3.5.1 and 2.13.4 or Eq. 3.5.10 and Eq. 2.14.9 integrated by\nparts):\n06'.da = 6w + 1'6t\nA W6\n4 .nda\n= 6w + t.6t\n(10)\nS\nS\nTo find the force on the dipole, the energy would be determined as a function of the electrijal excita-\nand t. Then, with the understanding that the derivative is taken with the quantities D.n and\niins\nB*n, respectively, held fixed on the surface S, the respective forces follow as\ni\ni w\nfi = -\n()\nf\n- -Di\naw\nf\naw\n(11)\nci\nNow, what would be obtained if this procedure were carried through for the electric case is already\nknown to be given by Eq. 4. Moreover, there is a complete analogy between every aspect of the electric\nand magnetic systems. The calculation in the magnetic case need not be repeated oncethe eljctric one\nis carried out. Rather, an identification of variables suffices to give the answer, E + H, P + joM.\nHence, it follows that Eq. 5 is replaced by the Kelvin magnetization force density\nF = --\nVH\n(12)\nThe Kelvin force densities, Eqs. 5 .and 12, suffer the weakness that they do not take into account\nthe interaction between dipoles. Moreover, is the average over the spectrum of dipole moments p or m\nleading to the polarization and magnetization densities consistent with the usage of these densities in\nChap. 2? These difficulties are overcome by a derivation based on thermodynamic principles. Because\nforce densities are then based on electrically measured constitutive laws, consistency with definitions\nalready introduced is insured.\nSec. 3.6\n\n3.7 Electric Korteweg-Helmholz Force Density\nThe thermodynamic technique used in this section for deducing the electric force density with\ncombined effects of free charge and polarizarion is a generalization of that used in determining dis-\ncrete forces in Sec. 3.5. This principle of virtual work is exploited because it is not practical to\npredict the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic fields.\nIn any derivation of a force density, it is important to be clear about (a) what empirically\ndetermined information is required, and (b) what postulates or assumptions are incorporated into the\nderivation or are implicit to an application of the force density. Generally, empirically determined\ninformation can be used to replace assumptions. As derived here, the only empirical information re-\nquired il an electrical conititutive law relating the macroscopic electric field to the polarization\ndensity P (or displacement D).\nThis relationship is typically determined by making electrical measure-\nments on homogeneous samples of the material. These amount to measurements of the terminal character-\nistics of capacitor-like configurations incorporating samples of the material. (In the lumped-parameter\nsystems of Sec. 3.5, the analogous empirical information was the electrical terminal relation.) With\nso little empirical information, the force density can only be identified if the system considered is\na conservative thermodynamic subsystem. Thus, the force density is derived picturing the system as\nhaving no dissipation mechanisms.\n(The same conservative system is considered in Sec. 3.5 to find\ndiscrete forces.)\nThe assumption is then made that the force density remains valid even in modeling\nsystems with dissipation. If dissipation mechanisms were to be incorporated into the system considered,\nthen a virtual power principle could be exploited to find the force density, but additional empirical\ninformation would be required.\nExperiments show that, for a wide range of materials, electrical constitutive laws take the form\nof state functions\nE\nE(a\n*a ,) or\n=\n( 1 .*.a m ,\n(1)\nThe a's are properties of the material.\nThus, if measurements are made on a homogeneous sample of the\nmaterial, the a's are varied by changing the composition of the sample. For example, a might be the\nconcentration of dipoles of a given species, or the concentration of one liquid in another. The number\nof a's usSd depends on the specific application. Most important for now is the distinction between\nchanging E in Eq. l.by changing the material and hence changing a's, and doing so by changing D. Some\nspecial cases of Eq. 1 are given in Table 3.7.1.\nTable 3.7.1. Constitutive laws having the general form of Eq. la.\nLaw\nDescription\nE= E- (al.am)D\nElectrically linear and (fields) collinear\nE\n= sij(a ... m)j\nElectrically linear and anisotropic\nS\nl(a 1\n...a\nD2 )D\nElectrically nonlinear and (fields) collinear\nEi = sij (...**m\nD,\nD1 D2, D3)D\nElectrically nonlinear and anisotropic\nThe third case of the table might represent a material in which dipoles are in Brownian equi-\nlibrium with.a nonpolar liquid. An applied field tendg to line up the dipoles and hence give rise to\na polarization density and hence to a contribution to D. In terms of two properties (al,a2), a model\nincluding the saturation effect, resulting as all dipoles become aligned with the field, might be\n,\n(2)\n/ +\nE o2\nBuilt into this example, and the general relation, Eq. 1, is the assumption that the constitutive law\nis a state function. It does not depend on rates of change, and it is a single-valued function of the\nvariables and hence not dependent on the path followed to arrive at the given state.\nThe continuum now considered is not homogeneous, in that at any given instant the a's can vary\nfrom one position to another. Moreover, for the electromechanical subsystem considered, the properties\nare tied to the material. As the material moves, properties change. For material within a volume of\nfixed identity,\nSec. 3.7\n\nf aidV = constant\n(3)\nV\nBy definition, the volume V is always composed of the same material. By definition, the a's must satisfy\nEq. 3 when the subsystem is considered to be isolated from other subsystems.\nThe finite number of mechanical degrees of freedom for the discrete coupling of Sec. 3.5 is now\nreplaced by an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The mechanical continuum, perhaps a fluid, perhaps\na solid, is capable of undergoing the vector deformations 6a. These incremental displacements are\nviewed as small departures from an equilibrium mechanical configuration which is precisely that for which\nthe force density is required.\nSince the time derivative of Eq. 3 vanishes, the generalized Leibnitz rule, Eq. 2.6.5, gives\n-\nt\n(4)\nda = 0\nV\nV\nS\nwhere by definition the velocity of the surface S is equal to that of the material (vs -t-)\nGauss'\ntheorem converts the second integral to a volume integral. Although of fixed identity, the volume is\narbitrary, and so it follows from Eq. 4 that changes in the property ai are linked to the material de-\nformations by an expression that is equivalent to Eq. 3:\n6a\n= -V.(a i6)\n(5)\nThe framework has now been established for stating and exploiting conservation of energy for the\nelectromechanical subsystem. The procedure is familiar from Sec. 3.5. With electrical excitations\nabsent, a system, such as shown in Fig. 2.13.1, is assembled mechanically. Because the force density\nof electrical origin is by definition zero during the process, no work is required. The system now\nconsists of rigid electrodes for producing part or all of the electrical excitations and a mechanical\ncontinuum in t e intervening space. This material is described by Eq. 1. With the mechanical deforma-\ntions fixed (6( = 0), the electrical excitations are next raised by placing bulk charges at the position\nof interest in the material and by raising the potentials on the electrodes. The result is a stored\nelectrical energy given by Eq. 2.13.6:\nD\nw =\nWdV; W =\n(al...,am').6'\n(6)\nV\nHere, V is the volume occupied by the material and the fields, and hence excluding the electrodes.\nNow, with the net charge on each electrode constrained to be constant, consider variations in the\nenergy caused by incremental displacements of the material. A statement of energy conservation\naccounting for work done on the external mechanical world by the force density of electrical origin is\n[6W + *6st]dV = 0\n(7)\nV\nThere are two consequences of the incremental displacement. First, the mechanical deformation carries\nthe properties with it, as already stated by Eq. 5. Second, there is a redistribution of the free\ncharge. Because the system is conservative, the free charge is constrained to move with the material.\nThe charge within a volume always composed of the same material particles is constant. Thus, Eq. 3\nalso holds with cai\nPf, and it follows that an expression similar to Eq. 5 can be written for the\nchange in charge density at a given location caused by the material displacement 64:\npf = -V*(Pf6)\n(8)\nIt is extremely important to recognize the difference between (W\nin Eq. 7, and 6W in Sec. 2.13.\nIn Eq. 7, the change in energy is caused by material displacements 6J, whereas in Sec. 2.13 it is due\nto changes in the electrical excitations. The energy W is assumed to be a state function of the same\nvariables as used to express the constitutive law, Eq. 1. Hence,\nm\n(9)\ni=1\ni\naD\nwhere\nBD\nii\ni\nSec. 3.7\n3.10\ns\n\nWith the understanding that the partial derivative is taken with the a's held fixed, it follows from\nEq. 6 that\naww=\nE\n(10)\naDf\nHence, the last term in Eq. 9 is written using Eq. 10 with E in turn replaced by -VW. Then, integration\nby parts* gives\n: * 6DdV\n-\n'6Dinda + f D(V6\n)dV\n(11)\nV\nS\nV\nThe part of the surface coincident with the electrode surfaces gives a contribution from each electrode\nequal to the electrode potential multiplied by the change in electrode charge. Because the electrode\ncharges are held fixed while the material is deformed, this integration gives no contribution. The\nremaining part of the surface integration is sufficiently well removed from the region of interest that\nthe fields have fallen off sufficiently to make a negligible contribution. Thus, the first term on the\nright vanishes and, because of Gauss' law, Eq. 11 becomes\nI W\n= f\np pdV\n(12)\n3D\n6-dV\nIt is now possible to write Eq. 7 with effects of 6t represented explicitly. Substitution of Eq. 8 into\n12 and then Eqs. 12 and 5 into 9, and finally of Eq. 9 into 7, gives\nm\nCE Zi=l\nV* (awi, ) -\nV (pf(p\n) +\n-.6t]dV = 0\n(13)\nV\nWith the objective of writing the integrand in the form ( )..6,\nthe first two terms are integrated by\nparts.\nBecause the surface integrations are either on 4he rigid electrode surfaces where 6t-i\n= 0, or\nat infinity where the fields have decayed to zero, and E = -V@, Eq. 13 becomes\nm\n'1\nfE +\n6 .6dV -\n(14)\ni=l\nIt is tempting, and in fact correct, to set the integrand of this expression to zero.\nBut the\njustification is not that the volume V is arbitrary. To the contrary, the volume V is a special one\nenclosing all of the region occupied by the deformable medium and fields. (The volume integration\nplays the role of a summation over the mechanical variables for the lumped-parameter systems of\nSec. 3.5.)\nThe integrand is zero because 6t (like the lumped-parameter displacements) is an independent\nvariable. The equation must hold for any deformation, including one confined to any region where P is\nto be evaluated:\nm\n-\nm\naw -\n= pE -\na\na V(i -)\n(15)\ni=l\ni\nIt is most often convenient to write the second term so that it is clear that it consists of a force\ndensity concentrated where there are property gradients and the \"gradient of a pressure\":\nm\nm\nF\npfE +\nZ -\nVa. -\nV [ E\na- i\n(16)\ni=l\ni\ni=l\ni\nThe implications of Eq. 16 and the method of its derivation are appreciated by considering three com-\nmonly encountered limiting cases and then writing Eq. 16 in such a way that its relation to the Kelvin\nforce density is clear.\nIncompressible Media: Deformations are then such that\nV.4 = 0\n(17)\nBecause 6t.n = 0 on the rigid electrode surfaces that comprise part of the surface S enclosing V in\nEq. 7, any pressure function fr that approaches zero with sufficient rapidity at infinity to make the\nsurface integration there negligible will satisfy the relation\nIntegration by parts in three dimensions amounts to\nIYV IdV\nV*(I)dV -\nAI VYdV\n'1TA-da -\nA *VdV\nV\nV\nV\nS\nV\n3.11\nSec. 3.7\n\n-6.nda\nf V.

For\nexample, W might be P*E, since this function decays with distance from the system sufficiently rapidly\nto make the contribution of the surface integration at infinity vanish. On the basis of this apparent\narbitrariness in the force density, the following observation is now made for the first time, and will\nbe emphasized again in Chap. 8. Two force densities differing by the gradient of a scalar pressure\nwill give rise to the same incompressible deformations. Physically this is so because in modeling a\ncontinuum as incompressible, the pressure becomes a \"left-over\" variable. It becomes whatever it must\nbe to make Eq. 17 valid. Whatever the Vii added to the force density of electrical origin, w can be\nabsorbed into the \"mechanical\" pressure of the continuum-force equation.\nFor incompressible deformations, where the force density is arbitrary to within the gradient of a\npressure, the gradient term can be omitted from Eq. 16, which then takes the convenient form\nF =pfE +\naE Vi\n(19)\ni=l 9T\nThis ex3ression concentrates the force density where there are proDertv gradients. In a charge-free\nsystem composed of regions having uniform properties, the force density is thus confined to inter-\nfaces between regions.\nIncompressible and Electrically Linear: For an incompressible material having the constitutive\nlaw\nD =\no (l + Xe)E = E\n(20)\nthe susceptibility Xe is conserved by a volume of fixed identity. That is, ac can be taken as Xe in\nEq. 3 and m = 1. Then, from Eq. 6,\nD2\n*W\neo 2\n2 eo(1 + Xe)' aXe\n- -\n(21)\nand because VXe = V[(1 + x )], it follows that the force density of Eq. 19 specializes to\n= pf -\n-\nE VE\n(22)\nElectrically Linear with Polarization Dependent on Mass Density Alone: Certainly a possible\nparameter al is the mass density p, since then Eq. 3 is satisfied. For a compressible medium it is\npossible that the susceptibility Xe in Eq. 20 is only a function of p.

For such situations, the Kelvin force density or the\nKorteweg-Helmholtz force density in the form of Eq. 19 will give rise to the same deformations. Note\nthat they have very different distributions.\nApparently the last term in Eq. 27 represents the interaction between dipoles omitted from the\nderivation of the Kelvin force density. In fact, this term vanishes when the constitutive law takes\na form consistent with the polarization being due to noninteracting dipoles. In that case, the\n=\nsusceptibility should be linear in the mass density so that Xe\ncp, where c is a constant. In Eq. 23,\n@Xe/aP = c, and evaluation shows that, indeed, the last term in Eq. 27 does vanish.\n3.8 Magnetic Korteweg-Helmholtz Force Density\nThermodynamic techniques for determining the magnetization force density are analogous to those\noutlined for the polarization force density in Sec. 3.7. In fact, if there were no free current density,\nthe magnetic field intensity, like the electric field intensity, would be irrotational. It would then\nbe possible to make a derivation that would be the complete analog of that for the polarization farce\ndensity. However, in the following the force density due to free currents is included and hence H is\nnot irrotational.\nThe constitutive law takes the form\nH = H(al,a2 .. am,B ) or I = (12*a\n(1)\nwith specific possibilities given in Table 3.7.1 with e +\ni, E + H and D -+ B. A conservative electro-\nmechanical subsystem is assembled mechanically, with no electrical excitations, so that it assumes a\nconfiguration identical to the one for which the force density is required. By the 'definition of the\nsubsystem, this process requires no energy. Then, with the mechanical system fixed (the a's fixed),\nelectrical excitations are applied so as to establish the free currents in excitation coils and in the\nmedium itself, with the distribution that for which the force density is required. This procedure is\nformalized in Sec. 2.12 and a system schematic is shown in Fig. 2.14.2. As was shown in Sec. 2.14,\ncurrents in excitation coils are conveniently regarded as part of the total distribution of free\ncurrent density. Hence, the volume of interest now includes all of the region permeated by the mag-\nnetic field.\nNow, with the electrical excitations established, a statement of conservation of energy, with\nthe electrical excitations held fixed but the material undergoing an incremental displacement, is\nEq. 3.7.7, where now W is the magnetic energy density given from Eq. 2.14.10 by\nB\nw =\nH(a1,a2**amB')*6'\n(2)\nThe following steps, leading to a dedugtion of the force density, are analogous to those taken\nin\n1.\nSec. 3.7.\nThe link between the a's and 6y is given by Eq. 3.7.5. What is the connection between\nJf and 6?\nActually, it is a link between the flux linkage and t that is appropriate. If the medium is to\nboth support a free current density and be conservative, the material must be idealized as having an\ninfinite conductivity. This means that any open material surface S (surface of fixed identity) must\nlink a constant flux:\nB-nda = 0\n(3)\nS\nOne way to make this deduction is to use the integral form of Faraday's law for a contour C enclosing\na surface S of fixed identity, Eq. 2.7.3b, with v - vs.\nBecause the medium is perfectly conducting,\nE' = 0 and what remains of Faraday's law is Eq. 3. From the generalized Leibnitz rule,Eq. 2.6.4, Eq. 3\nand the solenoidal nature of B require that\nf 6*nda +\n(6 x 6b).1 = 0\n(4)\nS\nC\n3.13\nSecs. 3.7 & 3.8\n\nStokes's theorem, Eq. 2.6.3, converts the contour integral to a surface integral. Because this sarface\nis arbitrary, the sum of the integrands must vanish. If it is further recognized that 6B = V x 6A, then\nit follows that\n4.\nA\n=\nx B\n(5)\nThus, there is established the link between material deformations and the alterations of the field that\nare required if the deformations are to be flux-conserving.\nThe change in W associated with the material deformation, called for in the conservation of energy\nequation, Eq. 3.7.7, is in general\nn\n6w =\n-\n+ w .\n6B\n(6)\noa\ni\nB\nwhere, in view of Eq. 2,\naW\n-j\n= H\n(7)\nIt is the integral over the total volume V of 6W that is of interest.

The representation of forces in terms of stresses will be used over and over again in the\nchapters which follow. This section is intended to give a brief summary of the differential and integral\nproperties of the stress tensor.\nSuppose that the ith component of a force density can be written in the form\naT.\n+\nFi = ax '; ( = V*T)\n(1)\nHere, the Einstein summation convection is applicable, so that because the j's appear twice in the\nsame term, they are to be summed from one to three. An alternative notation, in parentheses, re-\npresents the same operation in vector notation. Much of the convenience of recognizing the stress\ntensor representation of a force density comes from then being able to convert an integration of the\nforce density over a volume to an integration of the stress tensor over a surface enclosing the volume.\nThis generalization of Gauss' theorem is easily shown by fixing attention on the ith component (think\nof i as given) and defining a vector such that\nGi = Tilil + Ti2i2 + Ti3i3\n(2)\nThen the right-hand side of Eq. 1 is simply the divergence of i-i Gauss' theorem then shows that\n(3)\nFidV =\nV*'GidV =\nGi nda\nV\nV\nS\nor, in index notation and using the definition of Gi from Eq. 2,\n(4)\nIFidV = Tijnjda\nV\nS\nThis tensor form of Gauss' theorem is the integral counterpart of Eq. 1. Physically, Eq. 4 states that\nan alternative to integrating the force density in some Cartesian direction over the volume V is an\nintegration of the integrand on the right over a surface completely enclosing that volume V. The\nintegrand of the surface integral can therefore be interpreted as a force/unit area acting on the\n3.15\nSecs. 3.8 & 3.9\n\nr\nr\n·\nL·\n· ·\nenclosing surrace In tne itn alrecrlon. To alstinguisn it\nfrom a surface force density, it will be referred to as\nthe \"traction.\"\nIt does not act on a physical surface\nand has physical significance only when integrated over\na closed surface. It is simply the force/unit area that\nmust be integrated over the entire surface to find the\nnet force due to the volume force density\nTi\nTijnj;\n(5)\nIn vector notation and in terms of the traction f,\nEq. 4\nis written as\ndV -\nfnda\n(6)\nV\nS\nFigure 3.9.1 shows the general relationship of the traction\nFig. 3.9.1. Schematic view of volume V\nand normal vector. The traction can act in an arbitrary\nenclosed by surface S, showing trac-\ndirection relative to the surface.\ntion acting on elements of surface.\nTo develop a physical interpretation of the stress\ntensor components, it is helpful to consider a particular volume V and surface S with surfaces having\nnormals in the Cartesian coordinate directions. The cube shown in Fig. 3.9.2 is such a volume. Suppose\nthat interest is in determining the net force on the cube\nin the x direction, from Eq. 4. The required surface\nintegration can then be broken into separate integrations\nover each of the cube's surfaces. For the integration on\nthe right face, the normal vector has\nt\n-\n- a\n-\nE only\nJ an x component,\nJ\nso nthe\nonly contriDution to thna\nsurface integration is\nfrom Txx. Similarly, on the left surface, the normal\nvector is in the -x direction, and the integral over that\nsurface is of -Txx. The minus sign is represented by\ndirecting the stress arrow in the minus x direction in\nFig. 3.9.2. On the top and bottom surfaces, the normal\nTx\ncx\nvector is in the y direction, and the integration is of'\nplus and minus Txy. Similarly, on the front and back\nsurfaces, the only terms contributing to the traction\nare Txz. The stress tensor components represent normal\nstresses if the indices are equal, and shear stresses if\nthey are unequal. In eitner case, the stress componenL\nacting in the ith direction on a surface having its\nnormal in the jth direction is Tij.\nOrthog.onal compoients are a familiar way of\nrepresenting a vector F. In the coordinate system\n(xl,x2,x3) the components are denoted by Fj.\nWhat is\nFig. 3.9.2.\nStress components acting on\nmeant by a vector is implicit to how these components\ncube in the x direction.\ndecompose into the components of the vector expressed\nin a second orthogonal coordinate system (x1,x2.x3)\npictured in Fig. 3.9.3. The two coordinate systems are related by the transformation\naxk\nxk= axUN;\n5x\nk.=\n(7)\nwhere aki is the cosine of the angle between the xk axis and the x1 axis.\nA component of the vector in the primed frame in the ith direction is then given by\nF'\naijF\n(8)\nj\nFor example, suppose that i = 1. Then, Eq. 8 gives the x' component of F'\nas the projections of the\ncomponents in the xl, x2, x3 directions onto the x' direction. Equation 8 summarizes how a vector\ntransforms from one coordinate system onto another, and could be used to define what is meant by a\n\"vector.\"\nSimilarly, the components of a tensor transform from the unprimed to the primed coordinate system\nin a way that can be used to define what is meant by a \"tensor.\"\nTo deduce the transformation, begin\nwith Eq. 8 using the divergence of a stress tensor to represent each of the force densities (Eq. 1):\nSec. 3.9\n3.16\n\nJq.\nik\na\n(9)\nTxk\nij\nax\nNow, if use is made of the chain rule for dif-\nferentiation, and Eq. 7, it follows that\nT' k\naT\nDx\naT\nq\n= a\ni\n-\n- aija\nj\n(10)\nThus, the tensor transformation follows as\nTik\nij kakT j\n(11)\nUseful conditions on the direction\ncosines aij are obtained by recognizing that\nthe transformation from the primed frame to\nthe unprimed frame, given generally by\nF = bjiF'\n(12)\ninvolves the same direction cosines, because\nbz.\ndefined as the cosine of the anele between\nZg.

By way of\nanalogy to Eq. 6, is there a way in which the integration of the torque density can be converted to\nan integration over the enclosing surface? With respect to the origin, the total torque on material\nwithin the volume V is\nT =\nrx FdV\n(16)\nV\nwhere r is the vector distance from the origin. With F given as the divergence of a stress tensor,\nEq. 1, and provided that T is symmetric (Tij = Tji), the tensor form of Gauss' theorem can be used\nto show that\nS\nx (T.n)da\n(17)\nS\nThe net torque is the integral over the enclosing surface of a surface torque density r x T (see\nProblem 3.9.1).\n3.10 Electromechanical Stress Tensors\nThe objectives in this section are to illustrate how the stress tensor associated with any one\nof the force densities in Secs. 3.7 and 3.8 is determined, and to summarize the stress tensors for\nfuture reference.\nThe ith component of the Korteweg-Helmholtz force density, Eq. 3.7.16, written using Gauss' law\nto eliminate pf, is\n3.17\nSecs. 3.9 & 3.10\n\nIDj\nm\nm\naw\naak\na\nE\nW-\nFi = Ei ax\n+ E\ni i k=l a-k axi\naxi\nk-1 k ak\nThe goal in the following manipulations is to express this equation in the form of a tensor divergence\n(in the form of Eq. 3.9.1).\nThe second term can be replaced by Eq. 3.7.26.

For an isolated object in free space, this force\nis the same regardless of the particular force density used. If the force is considered as the integral\nof the force density over the volume of the object, this fact is by no means obvious. But, note that in\nfree space the stress tensors of Table 3.10.1 all agree, Because the enclosing surface S is in this\nfree space region, the same total force will result from integrating Eq. 3.9.6 regardless of the force\ndensity associated with the stress tensor.\n3.11 Surface Force Density\nIn many systems, the electric or magnetic force density is concentrated in a thin layer, usually\ncomprising the interface between two regions.\nIf the thickness of this layer is small compared to the\ndimensions of the adjacent regions and other lengths of interest, then the force per unit area on the\ninterface may be used to describe the layer. An interfacial section is enclosed by the incremental\nvolume of thickness A and area A = 6x6y, shown in Fig. 3.11.1. The surface force density is defined\nas a force per unit area of the interface in a limit in which first A and then A approach zero. The\nintegration of the electric force density throughout the control volume is convenient-y carried out\nusing the appropriate stress tensor Tij integrated over the enclosing surface. With n defined as the\nunit normal to the interface and tn the unit normal to the control surface, the surface force density is\n0+\nflim 1\n-'n\n=\nn\nlim 1\nT\nI T\nda =\nU\nn +\nT.1 dvdt\n(1)\nA+0 A\nn n\nAO A\n0-\nn\nA+0\nS\nIntegration is divided into two parts. The first is the contribution from the surfaces external to the\nlayer, having normals n and -n, respectively. The second accounts for the \"edges\" of the volume where\nthe surface cuts through the double layer.\nIf fields within the layer are of the same order as those\noutside, contributions of the second integral vanish as A + 0. In electroquasistatic systems, the\ndouble layer presents a case where the internal fields are sufficiently intense that the second term\nnot only makes a.contribution but one that can dominate the first term. The remainder of this section\nis devoted to converting this contribution to a more useful form.\nThe distance normal to the interface is y, with (p,y) orthogonal coordinates in the local inter-\nfacial plane, as shown in Fig. 3.11.1. In the absence of a double layer, the electric field is of the\nsame order of magnitude throughout, and hence in the limit A + 0, the second term in Eq. 1 becomes\nnegligible compared to the first. With the double layer, the stress contributions from the edges of\nthe control volume are of the same order as those from the exterior surfaces.\nAs discussed in Sec. 2.10, the tangential electric field suffers a discontinuity through the\ndouble layer. However, the tangential field within the layer is of the same order as the external\nfield. Because the thickness A over which the interior stresses act is much smaller than the linear\ndimensions 65 and 6d, the internal stress contributions to the integrations around the periphery of\nthe control volume are ignorable unless the double-layer charges are themselves responsible for a sub-\nstantially larger internal field than external field. This double-layer-generated field is directed\nnormal to the interface and dominates in determining the interior stresses. The stress taken now as\nrepresented by Eq. 3.7.19b of Table 3.10.1 is\nTij = EiD\nJ\n-\nijW'\n(2)\nwhere, in the case of a linearly polarized dielectric, the coenergy density W' is simply -E2/2.

Note that the sign of each curvature term is\ntaken as positive if the center of curvature is on the side of the interface toward which AI is\ndirected. The surface force density associated with surface tension takes this same form. However,\nthe convention used in Chap. 7 is with the radii of curvature the negatives of R1 and R2 .\nWith the\nunderstanding that R1 and R2 are radii of curvature taken as positive if the center of curvature is on\nthe side of the interface out of which A is directed, Eqs. 1, 4, and 7 give the surface force density,\nwith the double-layer contribution represented by the function yE,\n- =\n1 D . -\n-\n-y-\n1 ~\n+VT\n+\nn\nn\n[+ 1\nE R\nR 2\nE EE\nwhere\nYE\nO W'dv\n0-\nIt is shown in Sec. 7.6 that the second term in Eq. 8 can also be expressed as -YE(V.n)n.\nThe double layer surface force density is exemplified in Chap. 10.\nSec. 3.11\n3.20\n\n3.12\nObservations\nThe force densities and associated stress tensors of Table 3.10.1 are of two origins. The Kelvin\nforce densities, the last two in the table, come from a microscopic picture of particles and dipoles\nsubject to electric or magnetic forces which, through the agent of a kinetic equilibrium, are passed\nalong to the ponderable continuum. The Korteweg-Helmholz force densities, all of the others in the\ntable, are based on an energy conservation principle. The connection between micro and macro fields,\nneeded to apply this principle is made using electrical measurements of constitutive laws to inter-\nrelate the macroscopic fields A and t or B and A.\nThe arguments underlying each type of force density envoke certain assumptions which point to\npossible inadequacies. The Kelvin force densities picture the force acting on each dipole and each\npoint chargl in isolation and this force as being that transmitted to the ponderable media. This does\nnot allow for the possibility that the micro fields of one dipole contribute to the force on a neigh-\nboring dipole.\nThis shortcoming is obviated by the energy method, which is based on a statement of energy con-\nservation for an electromechanical subsystem. The resulting Korteweg-Helmholtz force densities 1 are\nof course also restricted. On the one hand, they are more broadly applicable than might be concluded\nfrom the derivations.\nFor example, the MQS continuum is viewed as \"perfectly conducting,\" but the\nfree current force density is certainly applicable in cases where the conductivity is finite. This is\nevident from its agreement with the Lorentz force density of Sec. 3.1, because the later model in-\ncludes a finite mobility and hence electrical dissipation.\nOne way to derive a force density without ambiguity as to the validity of the result in noncon-\nservative systems is to replace statements of energy conservation with those of power flow. 2 However,\nthe principle of virtual power requires information beyond that required by the principle of virtual\nwork used here. In addition to the constitutive laws relating the macroscopic field variables is the\nrequirement for the power flux density, which must either be assumed or measured.\nUnderlying all of the discussions in this chapter has been the presumption that a clear distinc-\ntion can be made between electric or magnetic force densities and those of other origins.\nThis is\ntantamount to being able to isolate electromagnetic energy storage from other forms of energy storage.\nPiezoelectric coupling is an example where it is not fruitful to make this distinction. In that area,\nthe stress and force density generally represent combined electric and mechanical electromechanical\neffects.\n1. J. A. Stratton, Electromagnetic Theory, McGraw-Hill Book Co.

It is common to speak of the \"force on a charge\" or the \"force on a current\"\neven though what is meant is the force on ponderable material. Interest might actually be in electric\nand magnetic forces acting on collections of fundamental charge carriers.\n(Motions of electron beams in\nvacuum are an example. The charged particles in that case constitute the continuum, in the sense that\nit is the electron inertia that enters into the equation of motion.)\nBut, more commonly, the charged\nparticles are imbedded in media, and it is the resulting force on the material that is of interest.\nExamples are as obvious as the electrical force of attraction between the capacitor plates of an electro-\nstatic voltmeter or the magnetic torque exerted on current-carrying conductors in a meter movement.\nSection 3.2 develops a specific model to illustrate how momentum imparted to charged particles by\nthe fields is transferred to the neutral media that support those particles. That macroscopic forces\nare more than simply an average over the forces on fundamental charges is further emphasized by consider-\ning the practical cases of polarization and magnetization forces. Force densities of engineering signifi-\ncance exist even in regions where the free charge and free current (and for that matter polarization\ncharge or magnetization charge) are absent. Such forces can be associated with a microscopic picture,\ndiscussed in Sec. 3.6, in which electrical forces on dipoles are transferred to the media.\nAlthough the dipole model is useful for forming a microscopic picture of electric polarization\nforces, it is restricted to cases where the dipoles do not significantly interact. In the pursuit of\na less restricted force density, developments in Secs. 3.7-3.8 are based on such measured macroscopic\nparameters as the permittivity and permeability. It is the business of thermodynamics to convert that\ninformation into the desired force densities.\nIn its own way, the line of reasoning presented in\nSecs. 3.5, 3.7 and 3.8 exemplifies a more basic point of view than one geared to a particular microscopic\nmodel. Thermodynamic concepts provide a means for replacing detailed and specialized derivations by\ncarefully defined physical measurements.\nThe stress-tensor representation of electromagnetic forces which concludes this chapter will see\ncontinual application in the following chapters. The tensor concept itself, introduced in Sec. 3.9,\nwill also be applied to the formulation of continuum mechanical and electromechanical equations.\n3.2\nThe Lorentz Force Density\nAlthough macroscopic forces were the first measured in the development of electricity and mag-\nnetism, it is now normally accepted that the fundamental force is that on a \"test\" charge. This charge\nmight be a jingle electron in free space. If the charged particle has a total charge q and moves with\na velocity vp, then the Lorentz force acting on the particle supporting the charge is\n= qE + qvp x\noH\n(1)\nThis statement, like the electrodynamic laws summarized in Chap. 2, is an empirical one. In most of the\nareas of continuum electromechanics, it is forces due to many charges that are of interest, and it is\ntherefore appropriate to sum the individual forces of Eq. 1 over the charges within a given unit of\nvolume to arrive at the Lorentz force density\nF = pfE + Jf x oH\n(2)\nIncremental volumes of interest have dimensions much greater than the characteristic distances between\nparticles. But also,\nfor the average electrical field to have meaning, it must be primarily due\nto sources external to the differential volume of interest. This ensures that, over an incremental\nvolume, each particle experiences essentially the same electric field. The contribution to the field\nof the charges within the differential volume is negligible. Similar arguments apply to the magnetic\nfield intensity, which must be produced over a given differential volume largely by currents outside\nthe volume.\nEquation 2 represents the force density acting on a ponderable medium if means are available for\nthe force on the particles to be transmitted to the medium. The mechanisms by which this happens are\ndiverse, and implicit to the conduction process. Whether the fundamental carriers are electrons in a\nmetal, holes and electrons in a semiconductor or ions in a liquid or gas, the average motions of\nfundamental charge carriers are superimposed on random motions. The flights of fundamental carriers\nare interrupted by collisions with lattice molecules (in a solid) or molecules that are themselves in\na Brownian equilibrium (in a liquid or gas) with a frequency that is usually extremely high compared\nto reciprocal times of interest. These collisions transfer momentum from the fundamental charge\ncarriers to the ponderable medium.\nSecs. 3.1 & 3.2\n\nTo more fully appreciate the transition from the force acting on fundamental carriers, Eq. 1, to\nthat on a material, Eq. 2, it is helpful to make a formal derivation. Although the discussion leads\nto rather general conclusions, only two families of carriers are now considered, one positive with\ncharge per particle q~and number density n+ and the other negative with a magnitude of charge q_ and\nnumber density n_. The average Lorentz force, Eq. 1, is in equilibrium with an average force repre-\nsenting the effect of collisions on the net migration of the particles:\nqE + q_(v_ + v) x U°H . m__\nq\n-\nq(v + v) x\nmVv\nThe retarding forces on the right are much as would be conceived for a swarm of macroscopic particles\nmoving through a viscous liquid. The average carrier velocities -+ are measured relative to the medium,\nwhich itself has the velocity V. Hence, on the right it is relative velocities of particles and medium\nthat appear, while in the Lorentz force it is total particle velocities that are appropriate. The co-\nefficients for the collisional forces are written as the product of the particle masses m± and collision\nfrequencies v+ as a matter of convention. Note that the inertial force on the carriers is ignored com-\npared to that due to collisions. This approximation would be invalidated in a plasma if the frequency\nof an applied electric field intensity were extremely high. But, in many conductors and certainly in the\nmost usual electromechanical situations, the inertial effects of the charge carriers can be ignored (see\n(Problem 3.3.1.).\nThe charge density and current density are written in terms of the microscopic variables as\nPf = nq -\nn_q_\n(4)\nJf - n+q+(v+ + v) -\nn q_(v_ + v)\n(5)\n+\n+\n+\n4.\n= n+q+v+ -\nn_q_v_ +\nfv\nThe average force density acting on the ponderable medium is the sum of the right-hand sides of Eq. 3,\nrespectively, multiplied by the particle densities n+:\nF = n+m+v+\n+ n m Vv\n(6)\nThe point in writing this equation is to formalize the statement that, through some collisional process,\nthe force on the fundamental carriers becomes the force on the medium. It is evident from the next\nstep that, at least in so far as the Lorentz force density is concerned, the details of the collisional\nequilibrium are not important. The left-hand sides of Eq. 3 (regardless, for example, of whether m+v+\nare functions of v+ or are constant) are substituted for the respective terms in Eq. 6 to obtain\nF -\n(nq - nq)E\n+ [(n q v\n-\nn_q_v_) + (nq\n-\nn_q_)v] x PoH\n(7)\nIn view of the definitions given by Eqs. 4 and 5, this expression is the Lorentz force density of Eq. 2.\nIts validity hinges on there being an instantaneous equilibrium between the forces on the fundamental\ncarriers and the \"collisions\" with the ponderable medium,but not on the details of that interaction.\n3.3 Conduction\nThere are three objectives in this section. The first is to have a microscopic picture of the\ncarrier motions to associate with ohmic or unipolar conduction models. The second is to illustrate\nhow constitutive laws for media in motion can be derived from models based on particular microscopic\nmodels, or (on the basis of the field transformations) found by generalizing empirically determined\nlaws established in the laboratory for materials at rest. Finally, a byproduct of the discussion\nis an introduction to Hall effect.\nConsider the carrier motions represented by Eqs. 3.2.3, with the magnetic field H - H i ex-\nternally imposed. The components of these equations then respectively become\n4tb+H o\n+b+ 1oH\nvx+\nv\nvZ+\nM\n+b+Ex\n+b E + b+v zoHo\n+b+Ez + b+VyoH\nSecs. 3.2 & 3.3\n(1)\n\nwhere particle mobilities are defined as b+ = q+/m+y+.\nThese three equations can be inverted to find the relative carrier velocities in terms of (EH,_):\n+b+\n-0\n+0\n+\n+b\nb+\noHo\n-b+o H\n+b\n+ o o\n-+\nE\nEy + Vz H\nEz - vy\nH\nz\nyoo\n(2)\nwhere A = 1 +.(o H b ) 2\nThese velocity components can now be introduced into Eq. 3.2.5 to express the free current density\nas\n4-\nq bs+ nqb\nf\n+ +\n- -\n-\nx\nIU J\nJ\nn\n(\n+\nnA\n(EAi\n+ Ei5)\n\\\n+\nf\n(3)\nA(n\nqb2\nn_q b2\nwhere E'\nE + v x POH is the electric field in a frame of reference moving with the material (for a\nmagnetoquasistatic system).\nFrom Eq. 3, it is clear that there are two components to the current density, one in the direc-\ntion of the imposed electric field and the second perpendicular to it. The latter term is called the\nHall current and is due to the tendency of the particles to move perpendicular to their own velocity\nand to the imposed magnetic field intensity. This last term is ignorable if\nioHob+ << 1\n(4)\nA typical magnetic flux density is poH = 1 (10,000 gauss, which is in the range where magnetic mate-\nrials saturate). Electrons in copper Rave a mobility on the order of 3 x 10-3 m2/volt sec, so that\nthe parameter on the left is then much less than 1. Ions in liquids have mobilities that are typically\n5 x 10-8 m2 /volt sec and the approximation is even better. But in silicon or germanium, where the\nelectron mobility is in the range of 10-1 m2/volt sec, the Hall effect is coming into play by the time\npoHo is of the order of unity. With the inequality of Eq. 4 satisfied, Eq. 3 reduces to the familiar\nform\n~ = (nq+b++ n qb)' + pf\n(5)\nIf the number density of charge carriers n+ and/or n_ remains essentially the same in spite of the\napplication of E, then the factor multiplying I in Eq. 5 is usefully regarded as a parameter character-\nizing the material, the electrical conductivity a.\nThis case of ohmic conduction is displayed by mate-\nrials ranging from metallic conductors, where the carriers are electrons and essentially immobile ions,\nto electrolytes, where ions of at least two species participate in the conduction. In any of these\ncases, for the ohmic model to be valid, the conduction must involve at least two species with both\nn+q+ and n.q. greatly exceeding the net charge pf.\nBy introducing the conductivity as a parameter,\nthe detailed analysis necessary to determine the self-consistent distributions of the individual\ncarriers is avoided. But to examine the conditions under which the conductivity model is valid, it\nis necessary to formulate the laws that govern the self-consistent carrier motions. This is best done\nin the context of molecular diffusion (Chap. 10) so that other important limitations on the model can\nalso be identified.\nEven though in accounting for conduction it is useful to have in mind microscopic mechanisms, it\nis also important to recognize the far-reaching implications of empirical relations. Given any con-\nduction law based on laboratory measurements made with a fixed sample, effects of material motion can\nbe brought in by using the transformation laws. For example, if it is known that the conductor obeys\nOhm's law when stationary, then in a primed inertial frame moving with the velocity _ of the conductor,\nthe experiment shows that\nJf4\n-E'\n(6)\nIn an electroquasistatic system, including polarization, Jf = Jf -\npfv (Eq. 2.5.12a) and E' - E\n(Eq. 2.5.9a). Hence, Eq. 6 becomes Eq. 5. In a magnetoquasistatic system, including magnetization,\nSec. 3.3\n~1\nVx+\nv ±\nVy+\nVz+\n-r +\n\n4.+\n+\n+\nJ;\nJ (Eq. 2.5.11b) and E\nE + v x\nH (Eq. 2.5.12b).\nSubstitution in Eq. 6 now gives Eq. 5, except\nfor the charge convection term pf0. In a magnetoquasistatic system, this term is second-order, as will\nbe argued in the next section.\nFundamental to the use of an empirical law determined for the stationary material is the assump-\ntion that material acceleration and deformation do not influence the conduction. In any case, if\nacceleration did effect the conduction, the close tie between conduction and the Lorentz force density,\nillustrated in this and the previous section, calls into question the notion that the electromechanics\ncan be modeled by a single continuum subject to the Lorentz force density.\n3.4 quasistatic Force Density\nThe Lorentz force density, Eq. 3.2.2, is composed of what will be termed, respectively, an elec-\ntric force density and a magnetic force density\n+\n4.\n+\nF = PfE + Jf x oH\n(1)\nIt is found in a wide range of applications that the force density is predominantly one or the other\nof these contributions. Polarization and magnetization force densities, not included in Eq. 1, are\nsimilarly identified with the respective quasistatic systems. In this section, dimensional arguments\nare given that demonstrate that the electric force density generally dominates in electroquasistatic\nsystems, while the magnetic force density dominates in magnetoquasistatic systems.\nThe line of reasoning is an extension of that introduced in Sec. 2.2.\nThe force density is\nnormalized in accordance with Eq. 2.3.4 and the free current density is represented as having the\nform of Eq. 2.3.1. Thus,\n2-+- E\nHE\n2.\n(2)\nS\n[p\nE + -M\n-\nJ)\na\ntJx\ni\nEQS\n(2)\n+\no 2em)2\nT+\n4+1\n]+\nQS\nF\nf E+ (\nE+ J) x H\nMQS\n(2)\nThe relative values of the time constants are summarized by Fig. 2.3.1. In the electroquasi-\nstatic system, T /T<< 1 and TmT /T2 = (em /) 2 << 1. Hence, the free charge density term is zero-\norder in Eq. 1, and the magnetic term is consistently ignoredl In the magnetoquasistatic force\ndensity of Eq. 3, (Tem/T)2 << 1, and the free charge force density is negligible compared to the mag-\nnetic term. Hence, the second term of Eq. 1 is used to the exclusion of the first in magnetoquasi-\nstatic systems.\n3.5 Thermodynamics of Discrete Electromechanical Coupling\nIn this section, the thermodynamic electric and magnetic energy storage subsystems are expanded\nto include the possibility of a finite number of discrete mechanical displacements of macroscopic\nmaterial. .Based on the notion of an energy function and a thermodynamic equilibrium, the force of\nelectrical origin associated with each of these displacements is determined. Typically, the method\nexploits a knowledge of the electrical terminal relations to determine the forces.\nThe approach\nis generalized in Secs. 3.7 and 3.8, where constitutive laws are the basis for finding the force\ndensity of electric origin. Except for mathematical manipulations, the derivations now reviewed draw\nupon all of the demanding issues confronted later in deriving force densities.\nElectroquasistatic Coupling: An example of a lumped-parameter electroquasistatic system is given\nwith Fig. 2.11.1, including a schematic representation of a finite number of mechanical displacements.\nAssociated with each of the displacements is an electromechanical force tending to displace a lumped\nelement by an amount 6 1i\"\nConservation of energy for the system with the geometry fixed is expressed by Eq. 2.13.8. Now,\nan incremental increase in the total energy caused by placing an increment of charge 6qi on an electrode\nhaving the voltage vi can be diminished by an amount equal to the work done on the external environ-\nment by the forces of electrical origin acting through the displacements of the associated mechanical\nentities. Thus, energy'conservation requires that\nn\nm\n6w =i= E\ndqi - jZ\nfj 6\n;\nw = w(ql.qn'gl...m)\n9(1)\ni=1\nj=1\n1. Electrons in vacuum can have a velocity approaching that of light.\nIn that case an imposed mag-\nnetic field can have a crucial effect on the EQS dynamics (See Sec. 11.2).\nSecs. 3.3, 3.4 & 3.5\n\nGiven the charges ql...qn and the displacement E1\"' m as independent variables, the energy function\nis uniquely determined. The \"displacements\" should be recognized as generalized variables in that they\ncould just as well be angular deflections, in which case the associated \"forces\" would be torques.\nTo determine w, constitutive relations vi(ql... qn\n* nl\"'En) must be known so that Eq. 1 can be\nintegrated. The integration is a line integral in a state-space composed of the independent variables.\nBecause the fj's are not known, and are defined as equal to zero in the absence of electrical excita-\ntions, integration on the mechanical variables (j is carried out first. This gives no contribution\nbecause as the displacements are brought to their final values, fj = 0 (no work is required to assemble\nthe system with the qj's = 0).\nThen, the integration on successive electrical variables is carried\nout, first on ql with all other qj's = 0, then on q2 with ql at its final value and all others zero,\netc. Formally, the integration of Eq. 1 gives\nn\nq\nw = Zf v (ql*1\n*,0..0,\n1l'\n92.m)6\nj\n(2)\nJ=l1o\nBecause the energy function is a state function specified by the independent variables, an incre-\nmental change in the total energy can also be written as\nn\nm\n6w =\nw\naw\nilw\n~\nqi\n6 q i\n+\nE\nj\n(3)\nIf the q's and the V's are independent variables in the sense that Eqs. 1 and 3 hold for arbitrary\ncombinations of incremental changes in these electrical and mechanical variables, then\naw\naw\nvi =\nfj =-' r\n(4)\nNote that the q's and C's are not necessarily independent of each other unless the system is isolated\nfrom the total system in which it is imbedded. Given w from Eq. 2, the electrical forces are determined.\nA consequence of the conservation of energy expressed by Eq. 1 is the reciprocity condition between\npairs of terminal variables. For example, derivatives of Eq. 4a, first with respect to qj and then of\nthe same equation but with i replaced by j, and with respect to qi, are related by\nav\nav\ni\nj\n(5)\nSqj m\niqqj\naqi\nOther reciprocity conditions follow from Eq. 4 by taking cross-derivatives to relate forces and volt-\nages to each other.\nIn dealing with practical lumped-parameter systems, it is often convenient to use the voltages\nrather than the charges as independent variables. If all of the voltages are to be independent\nvariables, it is appropriate to recognize that\nn\nn\nZ vi6qi =\nZ [6(vi9q)\n-\nqi6v1]\n(6)\ni=l\ni=l\nso that substitution into Eq. 1 gives\nn\nm\n6w' =\nE qi 6 v i +\nZ\nfjgj\n(7)\ni=l\nj=li\nwhere a coenergy function has been defined in terms of the energy function as\nn\nw'(v..n,\n...\n)\nZ viqi -\nw\n(8)\ni=l\nThe coenergy function is a particular case of an arbitrarily large number of functions that can be\ndefined. Any combination of charges and voltages can be independent variables, and a hybrid energy\nfunction, appropriately defined as a state function of this combination. With the voltages as inde-\npendent variables, an equation similar to Eq. 2 is found with the charges replaced by the voltages,\nand the voltages and displacements the independent variables:\naw\nawl\n(9)\navi\nac\nj =\nSec. 3.5\n\nThe coenergy function, like the energy function, is found from purely electrical considerations, as\ndescribed in Sec. 2.13.\nMagnetoquasistatic Coupling: Lumped-parameter electromechanical coupling in a magnetic field system,\ndescribed schematically by Fig. 2.12.1, can be given the same thermodynamic representation as that out-\nlined for electroquasistatic systems. The statement of conservation of energy for the system of dis-\ncrete coils and mechanical displacements is the generalization of Eq. 2.14.11, with the addition of the\nmechanical work done as an electrical force fj causes an incremental displacement 6j :\nn\n6w = E ii6X i\ni=1\nm\nE fj 6\nj=1\n(10)\nAll of the arguments given for the electric systems follow for the magnetic field systems if variables\nare identified:\nqi\nXi' vi\ni\n(11)\nw = W(Xl-X n, 1-' m); w' = w'(il...in, 1'''.m)\nThe magnetic force is the negative partial derivative of the magnetic energy with respect to the\nappropriate associated displacement, with the other displacements and all of the flux linkages held\nconstant. Similarly, the force can be found from the coenergy function by taking the derivative with\nrespect to the associated displacement with the other displacements and the currents held constant.\n3.6 Polarization and Magnetization Force Densities on Tenuous Dipoles\nForces due to polarization and magnetization lend further emphasis to the importance of making a\ndistinction between forces on microscopic charged particles and macroscopic forces on materials sup-\nporting those charges. The experiment depicted by Fig. 3.6.1 makes it clear that (1) there is more\nto the force density than accounted for by the Lorentz 4orce\ndensity, and (2) the additional force density is not p E (or\nin the magnetic analogue, PmH).\nA pair of capacitor plates are dipped into a dielectric\nliquid. With the application of a potential difference v, it\nis found experimentally that the liquid rises between the\nplates.*\nTo make it clear that the issues involved can be\nunderstood in terms of lumped-parameter concepts, the liquid\nbetween the plates is replaced by a solid dielectric material\nhaving the same polarizability as the liquid, so that the\nproblem is reduced to one of a solid dielectric slab rising\nbetween the plates as it is pulled from the liquid below.\nRecall that if the interface is well removed from the\nedges of the plates, an exact solution satisfying the quasi-\nstatic differential equations and boundary conditions in the\nneighborhood of the interface is E = (v/d)iz. Of course,\nthere is a fringing field in the neighborhood of the edges\nof the capacitor plates. However, because the slab and the\nliquid have the same dielectric constant and pf = 0, the\nfringing field has the same distribution as if the dielec-\ntric were not present.\na\nw into\npaper\n. . .\n.\n7 1.\"1\n................... z~i\n'.\" : ' :- '\n' \" ' . .\n-\n'\"\n' \" . .\n. .\n.\n- .\nX\nz-\n-\nIt might be tempting to take the force as being the\n:\n--.\nproduct of the net charge at any given point and the local\nelectric field, or ppE. However, everywhere in the dielec-\n:....\ntric bulk the polarization density is proportional by the\nsame constant to the electric field (Eq. 2.16.1).\nBcause\nFig. 3.6.1. Experiment demonstrating\nPf = 0, it follows from Gauss' law that E and hence P have\nthe existence of polarization\nno divergence, and so there is also no polarization charge\nforces that are not explicable\nin the dielectric. Furthermore, because the electric field\nin terms of forces on single\nis uniform and tangential to the interface, there is not even\ncharges.\na polarization surface charge density at the interface\n(Eq. 2.10.21).\nThroughout the dielectric, on the interface and in the bulk, there is no polarization\ncharge. Clearly, the force which makes the dielectric rise between the plates cannot be accounted for\nby a polarization charge density.\nSecs. 3.5 & 3.6\nIn an experiment, a-c voltage is used with a sufficiently high frequency that the material responds\nonly to the rms field and free charge cannot accumulate in the bulk.\n\nIf the polarized material is composed of individual dipoles, each\nsubject to an electrical force, and each transmitting this electrical\nforce to the neutral medium, it is clear that there is really no reason\nto expect that the force density should take the same form as that for\nfree charges. With free charges, it is the individual charges that\ntransmit their forces to the neutral medium through mechanisms dis-\ncussed in Sec. 3.2. Now concern is with the force on individual dipoles\nwhich transmit that force to the neutral medium, either because they are\ntied to a lattice structure (Fig. 2.8.1) or through collisional mecha-\nnisms similar to those discussed for charge carriers in Sec. 3.2.\nIn the following. it is assumed that the dipoles are subject to\nan electric field that is the average, or macroscopic, electric field.\n'Z\nThe development ignores the distortion of the electric field intensity\nat one dipole because of the neighboring dipoles. For this reason,\nFig. 3.6.2.

The dipole can be picqured\nas a pair of oppositely signed charges having the vector separation d. The negative charge is located\nat r. With the assumption that the force on the dipole is transmitted to the medium, the procedure\nis to compute the force on a single dipole, and then to average this force over all the dipoles. The\nnet force in the ith direction on the pair of charges taken as a unit is\nfi\nim q[E (\n+\n) - Ei(r)]\n(2)\nd-O\nThe limit is one in which the spacing of the charges becomes extremely small compared to other distances\no4 interest and, at the same time, the magnitude of the charges becomes very large, so that the product\nSqd remains finite. The dipole moment is defined as ;. The required limit of Eq. 2 becomes\nBE\nE\nfi\nimdq[Ei~()\n+\ndJ - Ei)] -\nj ax\n(3)\nThus, there is a net force on each dipole given in vector notation by\n)VE\n(4)\nyot$ that implicit to this vector representation is the definition of what is meant by the operator\nA.VB\nBy assumption, the net force on each dipole is transmitted to the macroscopic medium and it is\nappropriate then to think of averaging these polarization forces over all dipoles within the medium.\nIn general, this average would have to be taken with recognition that the microscopic dipoles could\nassume a spectrum of polarizations in a given electric field intensity. For present purposes, the\naverage can simply be represented as the multiplication of Eq. 4 by the number of dipoles, n, per unit\nvolume. With the definition of the polarization density as P -\nnp, the Kelvin polarization force\ndensity is found:\nF = .V\n(5)\nCan the force density given by Eq. 5 be used to explain the rise of the dielectric between the\nplates in Fig. 3.6.1? Certainly, there is no force density in material regions of uniform electric\nfield, because then the -spatial derivatives called for with Eq. 5 vanish. However, in the fringing\nfield at the lower edges of the plates, the electric field intensity does vary rapidly. In that region,\nthe permittivity is a constant, and for a linear dielectric, where D = El, Eq. 5 becomes [in dealing\nwith vectors and tensors, a term in which a subscript appears twice is to be summed 1 to 3 (unless\notherwise indicated)]\nBE\nBE\n,\n-\nEi\nE\na\n1(-\n(6\nFi\no\n( - e)E j\n(P- S)E\nxi\n(E - Eo)\n(\nE)\n(6)\nwhere the irrotational nature of E is exploited, aEi/axj -\naEj/axi.

In such\nregions, the force density has the direction of maximum rate of increase of the electric energy storage.\nTypical force vectors, sketched in Fig. 3.6.1, tend to push the dielectric upward between the plates.\nIt 4s important not to overgeneralize from Eq. 7. In any configuration in which there is a component\nof E perpendicular to an interface, there is a singular component of the Kelvin force density acting at\nthe interface -- a surface force density. Such a component would be incorrectly inferred from Eq. 7,\nwhich is not valid through the interfacial region.\nConsider now the force density acting on a continuum of dilute magnetic dipoles that, like the\nanalogous electric dipoles just considered, pass along a force of electric origin to a macroscopic\nmedium via collisions or lattice constraints. It is not possible to use the Lorentz force law as a\nstarting point unless magnetic monopoles and an analogous force law on these magnetic \"charges\" is\npostulated. Without introducing such notions, the Kelvin magnetization force density can be deduced\nas follows.\nElectroquasistatic and magnetoquasistatic systems are piStured abstractly in Fig. 3.6.3. A volume\nenclosing the region occupied by a dipole having the position 5 has a surface S and includes neither\nfree charge in the EQS system nor free current in the MQS system. Hence the fields are governed by\nFig. 3.6.3a. EQS system\nFig. 3.6.3b. MQS system\nVx E = 0; E = -V\nVx H\n0; H= -VY\n(8)\no+\nV*(EcoE + P) = 0; P = np\nV.(0oH + 1oM ) = O; M f nm\n(9)\nStatements that the input of electric energy either goes into increasing the total energy stored or in-\nto doing work on the dipoles are (see Eqs. 3.5.1 and 2.13.4 or Eq. 3.5.10 and Eq. 2.14.9 integrated by\nparts):\n06'.da = 6w + 1'6t\nAW6\n4 .nda\n= 6w + t.6t\n(10)\nS\nS\nTo find the force on the dipole, the energy would be determined as a function of the electrijal excita-\niins and t. Then, with the understanding that the derivative is taken with the quantities D.n and\nB*n, respectively, held fixed on the surface S, the respective forces follow as\ni w\nfi = -\n()\naw\nf\naw\n(11)\nf i - -Di\nci\nNow, what would be obtained if this procedure were carried through for the electric case is already\nknown to be given by Eq. 4. Moreover, there is a complete analogy between every aspect of the electric\nand magnetic systems. The calculation in the magnetic case need not be repeated oncethe eljctric one\nis carried out. Rather, an identification of variables suffices to give the answer, E + H, P + joM.\nHence, it follows that Eq. 5 is replaced by the Kelvin magnetization force density\nF = --\nVH\n(12)\nThe Kelvin force densities, Eqs. 5 .and 12, suffer the weakness that they do not take into account\nthe interaction between dipoles. Moreover, is the average over the spectrum of dipole moments p or m\nleading to the polarization and magnetization densities consistent with the usage of these densities in\nChap. 2? These difficulties are overcome by a derivation based on thermodynamic principles. Because\nforce densities are then based on electrically measured constitutive laws, consistency with definitions\nalready introduced is insured.\nSec. 3.6\n\n3.7 Electric Korteweg-Helmholz Force Density\nThe thermodynamic technique used in this section for deducing the electric force density with\ncombined effects of free charge and polarizarion is a generalization of that used in determining dis-\ncrete forces in Sec. 3.5. This principle of virtual work is exploited because it is not practical to\npredict the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic fields.\nIn any derivation of a force density, it is important to be clear about (a)what empirically\ndetermined information is required, and (b)what postulates or assumptions are incorporated into the\nderivation or are implicit to an application of the force density. Generally, empirically determined\ninformation can be used to replace assumptions. As derived here, the only empirical information re-\nquired il an electrical conititutive law relating the macroscopic electric field to the polarization\ndensity P (or displacement D).\nThis relationship is typically determined by making electrical measure-\nments on homogeneous samples of the material. These amount to measurements of the terminal character-\nistics of capacitor-like configurations incorporating samples of the material. (In the lumped-parameter\nsystems of Sec. 3.5, the analogous empirical information was the electrical terminal relation.) With\nso little empirical information, the force density can only be identified if the system considered is\na conservative thermodynamic subsystem. Thus, the force density is derived picturing the system as\nhaving no dissipation mechanisms.\n(The same conservative system is considered in Sec. 3.5 to find\ndiscrete forces.)\nThe assumption is then made that the force density remains valid even in modeling\nsystems with dissipation. If dissipation mechanisms were to be incorporated into the system considered,\nthen a virtual power principle could be exploited to find the force density, but additional empirical\ninformation would be required.\nExperiments show that, for a wide range of materials, electrical constitutive laws take the form\nof state functions\nE\nE(a\n*a ,) or\nm\n=\n(\n.*.a ,\n(1)\nThe a's are properties of the material.\nThus, if measurements are made on a homogeneous sample of the\nmaterial, the a's are varied by changing the composition of the sample. For example, a might be the\nconcentration of dipoles of a given species, or the concentration of one liquid in another. The number\nof a's usSd depends on the specific application. Most important for now is the distinction between\nchanging E in Eq. l.by changing the material and hence changing a's, and doing so by changing D. Some\nspecial cases of Eq. 1 are given in Table 3.7.1.\nTable 3.7.1. Constitutive laws having the general form of Eq. la.\nLaw\nDescription\nE=E- (al.am)D\nElectrically linear and (fields) collinear\nE\n= sij(a ... m)j\nElectrically linear and anisotropic\nS\nl(a1...a\nD2 )D\nElectrically nonlinear and (fields) collinear\nEi = sij (...**m\nD,\nD1 D2, D3)D\nElectrically nonlinear and anisotropic\nThe third case of the table might represent a material in which dipoles are in Brownian equi-\nlibrium with.a nonpolar liquid. An applied field tendg to line up the dipoles and hence give rise to\na polarization density and hence to a contribution to D. In terms of two properties (al,a2), a model\nincluding the saturation effect, resulting as all dipoles become aligned with the field, might be\n,\n(2)\n/ +\no2\nE\nBuilt into this example, and the general relation, Eq. 1, is the assumption that the constitutive law\nis a state function. It does not depend on rates of change, and it is a single-valued function of the\nvariables and hence not dependent on the path followed to arrive at the given state.\nThe continuum now considered is not homogeneous, in that at any given instant the a's can vary\nfrom one position to another. Moreover, for the electromechanical subsystem considered, the properties\nare tied to the material. As the material moves, properties change. For material within a volume of\nfixed identity,\nSec. 3.7\n\nf aidV = constant\n(3)\nV\nBy definition, the volume V is always composed of the same material. By definition, the a's must satisfy\nEq. 3 when the subsystem is considered to be isolated from other subsystems.\nThe finite number of mechanical degrees of freedom for the discrete coupling of Sec. 3.5 is now\nreplaced by an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The mechanical continuum, perhaps a fluid, perhaps\na solid, is capable of undergoing the vector deformations 6a. These incremental displacements are\nviewed as small departures from an equilibrium mechanical configuration which is precisely that for which\nthe force density is required.\nSince the time derivative of Eq. 3 vanishes, the generalized Leibnitz rule, Eq. 2.6.5, gives\n-\nt\nda = 0\n(4)\nV\nV\nS\nwhere by definition the velocity of the surface S is equal to that of the material (vs -t-)\nGauss'\ntheorem converts the second integral to a volume integral. Although of fixed identity, the volume is\narbitrary, and so it follows from Eq. 4 that changes in the property ai are linked to the material de-\nformations by an expression that is equivalent to Eq. 3:\n6a\n= -V.(a i6)\n(5)\nThe framework has now been established for stating and exploiting conservation of energy for the\nelectromechanical subsystem. The procedure is familiar from Sec. 3.5. With electrical excitations\nabsent, a system, such as shown in Fig. 2.13.1, is assembled mechanically. Because the force density\nof electrical origin is by definition zero during the process, no work is required. The system now\nconsists of rigid electrodes for producing part or all of the electrical excitations and a mechanical\ncontinuum in t e intervening space. This material is described by Eq. 1. With the mechanical deforma-\ntions fixed (6(= 0), the electrical excitations are next raised by placing bulk charges at the positions\nof interest in the material and by raising the potentials on the electrodes. The result is a stored\nelectrical energy given by Eq. 2.13.6:\nD\nw =\nWdV; W =\n(al...,am').6'\n(6)\nV\nHere, V is the volume occupied by the material and the fields, and hence excluding the electrodes.\nNow, with the net charge on each electrode constrained to be constant, consider variations in the\nenergy caused by incremental displacements of the material. A statement of energy conservation\naccounting for work done on the external mechanical world by the force density of electrical origin is\n[6W + *6st]dV = 0\n(7)\nV\nThere are two consequences of the incremental displacement. First, the mechanical deformation carries\nthe properties with it, as already stated by Eq. 5. Second, there is a redistribution of the free\ncharge. Because the system is conservative, the free charge is constrained to move with the material.\nThe charge within a volume always composed of the same material particles is constant. Thus, Eq. 3\nalso holds with cai\nPf, and it follows that an expression similar to Eq. 5 can be written for the\nchange in charge density at a given location caused by the material displacement 64:\npf = -V*(Pf6)\n(8)\nIt is extremely important to recognize the difference between (Win Eq. 7, and 6W in Sec. 2.13.\nIn Eq. 7, the change in energy is caused by material displacements 6J, whereas in Sec. 2.13 it is due\nto changes in the electrical excitations. The energy W is assumed to be a state function of the same\nvariables as used to express the constitutive law, Eq. 1. Hence,\nm\n(9)\ni=1\ni\naD\nwhere\nBD\nii\ni\nSec. 3.7\n3.10\n\nWith the understanding that the partial derivative is taken with the a's held fixed, it follows from\nEq. 6 that\naww=\nE\n(10)\naDf\nHence, the last term in Eq. 9 is written using Eq. 10 with E in turn replaced by -VW. Then, integration\nby parts* gives\n* 6DdV\n:\n-\n'6Dinda + f D(V6\n)dV\n(11)\nV\nS\nV\nThe part of the surface coincident with the electrode surfaces gives a contribution from each electrode\nequal to the electrode potential multiplied by the change in electrode charge. Because the electrode\ncharges are held fixed while the material is deformed, this integration gives no contribution. The\nremaining part of the surface integration is sufficiently well removed from the region of interest that\nthe fields have fallen off sufficiently to make a negligible contribution. Thus, the first term on the\nright vanishes and, because of Gauss' law, Eq. 11 becomes\nI W 6-dV = f\nppdV\n(12)\n3D\nIt is now possible to write Eq. 7 with effects of 6t represented explicitly. Substitution of Eq. 8 into\n12 and then Eqs. 12 and 5 into 9, and finally of Eq. 9 into 7, gives\nm\nZi=l\nCE\nV* (awi, ) -\nV (pf(p) +\n-.6t]dV = 0\n(13)\nV\nWith the objective of writing the integrand in the form ( )..6,\nthe first two terms are integrated by\nparts.\nBecause the surface integrations are either on 4he rigid electrode surfaces where 6t-i\n= 0, or\nat infinity where the fields have decayed to zero, and E = -V@, Eq. 13 becomes\nm\n'1\nfE +\n6.6dV -\n(14)\ni=l\nIt is tempting, and in fact correct, to set the integrand of this expression to zero.\nBut the\njustification is not that the volume V is arbitrary. To the contrary, the volume V is a special one\nenclosing all of the region occupied by the deformable medium and fields. (The volume integration\nplays the role of a summation over the mechanical variables for the lumped-parameter systems of\nSec. 3.5.)\nThe integrand is zero because 6t (like the lumped-parameter displacements) is an independent\nvariable. The equation must hold for any deformation, including one confined to any region where P is\nto be evaluated:\nm\n-\nm\naw -\n= pE -\na V(i-)\n(15)\ni=l\ni\nIt is most often convenient to write the second term so that it is clear that it consists of a force\ndensity concentrated where there are property gradients and the \"gradient of a pressure\":\nm\nm\nF\npfE +\nZ -\nVa. -\nV [ E\na- i\n(16)\ni=l\ni\ni=l\ni\nThe implications of Eq. 16 and the method of its derivation are appreciated by considering three com-\nmonly encountered limiting cases and then writing Eq. 16 in such a way that its relation to the Kelvin\nforce density is clear.\nIncompressible Media: Deformations are then such that\nV.4 = 0\n(17)\nBecause 6t.n = 0 on the rigid electrode surfaces that comprise part of the surface S enclosing V in\nEq. 7, any pressure function frthat approaches zero with sufficient rapidity at infinity to make the\nsurface integration there negligible will satisfy the relation\nIntegration by parts in three dimensions amounts to\nIYVIdV\nV*(I)dV -\nAIVYdV\n'1TA-da -\nA*VdV\nV\nV\nV\nS\nV\nSec. 3.7\n3.11\n\n-6.nda\nf V. (r6 )dV = 0\n(18)\nS\nV\nThus, Eq. 14 remains valid even if the volume integral of Eq. 18 is added to it.\nBut, for incompressible\ndeformations as defined with Eq. 17, V.(ur6b) -\nVin*.\nThus, the term added to Eq. 14, like those already\nappearing in its integrand, can be written with 6t as a factor.\nIt follows that for incompressible de-\nformations, the gradieat of any scalar pressure, W, can be added to the force density of Eq. 16. For\nexample, W might be P*E, since this function decays with distance from the system sufficiently rapidly\nto make the contribution of the surface integration at infinity vanish. On the basis of this apparent\narbitrariness in the force density, the following observation is now made for the first time, and will\nbe emphasized again in Chap. 8. Two force densities differing by the gradient of a scalar pressure\nwill give rise to the same incompressible deformations. Physically this is so because in modeling a\ncontinuum as incompressible, the pressure becomes a \"left-over\" variable. It becomes whatever it must\nbe to make Eq. 17 valid. Whatever the Vii added to the force density of electrical origin, w can be\nabsorbed into the \"mechanical\" pressure of the continuum-force equation.\nFor incompressible deformations, where the force density is arbitrary to within the gradient of a\npressure, the gradient term can be omitted from Eq. 16, which then takes the convenient form\nF =pfE +\naE Vi\n(19)\ni=l 9T\nThis ex3ression concentrates the force density where there are proDertv gradients. In a charge-free\nsystem composed of regions having uniform properties, the force density is thus confined to inter-\nfaces between regions.\nIncompressible and Electrically Linear: For an incompressible material having the constitutive\nlaw\nD =\no(l + Xe)E = E\n(20)\nthe susceptibility Xe is conserved by a volume of fixed identity. That is, ac can be taken as Xe in\nEq. 3 and m = 1. Then, from Eq. 6,\nD2\n*W\neo 2\n2 eo(1 + Xe)' aXe\n- -\n(21)\nand because VXe = V[(1 + x )], it follows that the force density of Eq. 19 specializes to\n= pf -\n-\nE2VE\n(22)\nElectrically Linear with Polarization Dependent on Mass Density Alone: Certainly a possible\nparameter al is the mass density p, since then Eq. 3 is satisfied. For a compressible medium it is\npossible that the susceptibility Xe in Eq. 20 is only a function of p.

For such situations, the Kelvin force density or the\nKorteweg-Helmholtz force density in the form of Eq. 19 will give rise to the same deformations. Note\nthat they have very different distributions.\nApparently the last term in Eq. 27 represents the interaction between dipoles omitted from the\nderivation of the Kelvin force density. In fact, this term vanishes when the constitutive law takes\na form consistent with the polarization being due to noninteracting dipoles. In that case, the\nsusceptibility should be linear in the mass density so that Xe = cp, where c is a constant. In Eq. 23,\n@Xe/aP = c, and evaluation shows that, indeed, the last term in Eq. 27 does vanish.\n3.8 Magnetic Korteweg-Helmholtz Force Density\nThermodynamic techniques for determining the magnetization force density are analogous to those\noutlined for the polarization force density in Sec. 3.7. In fact, if there were no free current density,\nthe magnetic field intensity, like the electric field intensity, would be irrotational. It would then\nbe possible to make a derivation that would be the complete analog of that for the polarization farce\ndensity. However, in the following the force density due to free currents is included and hence H is\nnot irrotational.\nThe constitutive law takes the form\nH = H(al,a2.. am,B ) or I = (12*a\n(1)\nwith specific possibilities given in Table 3.7.1 with e +\ni, E + H and D -+ B. A conservative electro-\nmechanical subsystem is assembled mechanically, with no electrical excitations, so that it assumes a\nconfiguration identical to the one for which the force density is required. By the 'definitionof the\nsubsystem, this process requires no energy. Then, with the mechanical system fixed (the a's fixed),\nelectrical excitations are applied so as to establish the free currents in excitation coils and in the\nmedium itself, with the distribution that for which the force density is required. This procedure is\nformalized in Sec. 2.12 and a system schematic is shown in Fig. 2.14.2. As was shown in Sec. 2.14,\ncurrents in excitation coils are conveniently regarded as part of the total distribution of free\ncurrent density. Hence, the volume of interest now includes all of the region permeated by the mag-\nnetic field.\nNow, with the electrical excitations established, a statement of conservation of energy, with\nthe electrical excitations held fixed but the material undergoing an incremental displacement, is\nEq. 3.7.7, where now W is the magnetic energy density given from Eq. 2.14.10 by\nB\nw =\nH(a1,a2**amB')*6'\n(2)\nThe following steps, leading to a dedugtion of the force density, are analogous to those taken\nin Sec. 3.7.\nThe link between the a's and 6y is given by Eq. 3.7.5. What is the connection between\n1.Jf and 6?\nActually, it is a link between the flux linkage and t that is appropriate. If the medium is to\nboth support a free current density and be conservative, the material must be idealized as having an\ninfinite conductivity. This means that any open material surface S (surface of fixed identity) must\nlink a constant flux:\nB-nda = 0\n(3)\nS\nOne way to make this deduction is to use the integral form of Faraday's law for a contour C enclosing\na surface S of fixed identity, Eq. 2.7.3b, with v - vs.\nBecause the medium is perfectly conducting,\nE' = 0 and what remains of Faraday's law is Eq. 3. From the generalized Leibnitz rule,Eq. 2.6.4, Eq. 3\nand the solenoidal nature of B require that\nf 6*nda +\n(6 x 6b).1 = 0\n(4)\nS\nC\nSecs. 3.7 & 3.8\n3.13\n\nStokes's theorem, Eq. 2.6.3, converts the contour integral to a surface integral. Because this sarface\nis arbitrary, the sum of the integrands must vanish. If it is further recognized that 6B = V x 6A, then\nit follows that\n4.\nA=\nx B\n(5)\nThus, there is established the link between material deformations and the alterations of the field that\nare required if the deformations are to be flux-conserving.\nThe change in W associated with the material deformation, called for in the conservation of energy\nequation, Eq. 3.7.7, is in general\nn\n6w =\n-\n+ w.\n6B\n(6)\noa\ni\nB\nwhere, in view of Eq. 2,\naW\n-j\n= H\n(7)\nIt is the integral over the total volume V of 6W that is of interest.

The representation of forces in terms of stresses will be used over and over again in the\nchapters which follow. This section is intended to give a brief summary of the differential and integral\nproperties of the stress tensor.\nSuppose that the ith component of a force density can be written in the form\naT.\n+\nFi = ax '; ( = V*T)\n(1)\nHere, the Einstein summation convection is applicable, so that because the j's appear twice in the\nsame term, they are to be summed from one to three. An alternative notation, in parentheses, re-\npresents the same operation in vector notation. Much of the convenience of recognizing the stress\ntensor representation of a force density comes from then being able to convert an integration of the\nforce density over a volume to an integration of the stress tensor over a surface enclosing the volume.\nThis generalization of Gauss' theorem is easily shown by fixing attention on the ith component (think\nof i as given) and defining a vector such that\nGi = Tilil + Ti2i2 + Ti3i3\n(2)\nThen the right-hand side of Eq. 1 is simply the divergence of i-i Gauss' theorem then shows that\nFidV =\nV*'GidV =\nGi nda\n(3)\nV\nV\nS\nor, in index notation and using the definition of Gi from Eq. 2,\nIFidV = Tijnjda\n(4)\nV\nS\nThis tensor form of Gauss' theorem is the integral counterpart of Eq. 1. Physically, Eq. 4 states that\nan alternative to integrating the force density in some Cartesian direction over the volume V is an\nintegration of the integrand on the right over a surface completely enclosing that volume V. The\nintegrand of the surface integral can therefore be interpreted as a force/unit area acting on the\nSecs. 3.8 & 3.9\n3.15\n\nenclosing surrace In tne itn alrecrlon. To alstinguisn it\nfrom a surface force density, it will be referred to as\nthe \"traction.\"\nIt does not act on a physical surface\nand has physical significance only when integrated over\na closed surface. It is simply the force/unit area that\nmust be integrated over the entire surface to find the\nnet force due to the volume force density\nTi\nTijnj;\n(5)\nIn vector notation and in terms of the traction f,\nEq. 4\nis written as\ndV -\nfnda\n(6)\nV\nS\nFigure 3.9.1 shows the general relationship of the traction\nFig. 3.9.1. Schematic view of volume V\nand normal vector. The traction can act in an arbitrary\nenclosed by surface S, showing trac-\ndirection relative to the surface.\ntion acting on elements of surface.\nTo develop a physical interpretation of the stress\ntensor components, it is helpful to consider a particular volume V and surface S with surfaces having\nnormals in the Cartesian coordinate directions. The cube shown in Fig. 3.9.2 is such a volume. Suppose\nthat interest is in determining the net force on the cube\nin the x direction, from Eq. 4. The required surface\nintegration can then be broken into separate integrations\nover each of the cube's surfaces. For the integration on\nthe right face, the normal vector has only an x component,\nt\na\n-\n-\n-\nE\nJ\nJ\nso ntheonly contriDution to thna\nsurface integration is\nfrom Txx. Similarly, on the left surface, the normal\nvector is in the -x direction, and the integral over that\nsurface is of -Txx. The minus sign is represented by\ndirecting the stress arrow in the minus x direction in\nFig. 3.9.2. On the top and bottom surfaces, the normal\nTx\nvector is in the y direction, and the integration is of'\nplus and minus Txy. Similarly, on the front and back\nsurfaces, the only terms contributing to the traction\nare Txz. The stress tensor components represent normal\nstresses if the indices are equal, and shear stresses if\ncx\nthey are unequal. In eitner case, the stress componenL\nacting in the ith direction on a surface having its\nnormal in the jth direction is Tij.\nOrthog.onal compoients are a familiar way of\nrepresenting a vector F. In the coordinate system\n(xl,x2,x3) the components are denoted by Fj.\nWhat is\nFig. 3.9.2.\nStress components acting on\nmeant by a vector is implicit to how these components\ncube in the x direction.\ndecompose into the components of the vector expressed\nin a second orthogonal coordinate system (x1,x2.x3)\npictured in Fig. 3.9.3. The two coordinate systems are related by the transformation\naxk\nxk= axUN;\n5x\nk.=\n(7)\nwhere aki is the cosine of the angle between the xk axis and the x1 axis.\nA component of the vector in the primed frame in the ith direction is then given by\nF'\naijFj\n(8)\nFor example, suppose that i = 1. Then, Eq. 8 gives the x' component of F'\nas the projections of the\ncomponents in the xl, x2, x3 directions onto the x' direction. Equation 8 summarizes how a vector\ntransforms from one coordinate system onto another, and could be used to define what is meant by a\n\"vector.\"\nSimilarly, the components of a tensor transform from the unprimed to the primed coordinate system\nin a way that can be used to define what is meant by a \"tensor.\"\nTo deduce the transformation, begin\nwith Eq. 8 using the divergence of a stress tensor to represent each of the force densities (Eq. 1):\nSec. 3.9\nr\nr\n·\nL·\n· ·\n3.16\n\nJq.\nik\na\n(9)\nTxk\nij\nax\nNow, if use is made of the chain rule for dif-\nferentiation, and Eq. 7, it follows that\nT'k\naT\nDx\naT\nq\n= a\ni\n-\n- aija\nj\n(10)\nThus, the tensor transformation follows as\nTik\nij kakTj\n(11)\nUseful conditions on the direction\ncosines aij are obtained by recognizing that\nthe transformation from the primed frame to\nthe unprimed frame, given generally by\nF = bjiF'\n(12)\ninvolves the same direction cosines, because\nbz.\ndefined as the cosine of the anele between\nj\n,\nthe\nx\naxis\nand\nthe\nx\nax\na\nZg.

By way of\nanalogy to Eq. 6, is there a way in which the integration of the torque density can be converted to\nan integration over the enclosing surface? With respect to the origin, the total torque on material\nwithin the volume V is\nT =\nrx FdV\n(16)\nV\nwhere r is the vector distance from the origin. With F given as the divergence of a stress tensor,\nEq. 1, and provided that T is symmetric (Tij = Tji), the tensor form of Gauss' theorem can be used\nto show that\nS\nx (T.n)da\n(17)\nS\nThe net torque is the integral over the enclosing surface of a surface torque density r x T (see\nProblem 3.9.1).\n3.10 Electromechanical Stress Tensors\nThe objectives in this section are to illustrate how the stress tensor associated with any one\nof the force densities in Secs. 3.7 and 3.8 is determined, and to summarize the stress tensors for\nfuture reference.\nThe ith component of the Korteweg-Helmholtz force density, Eq. 3.7.16, written using Gauss' law\nto eliminate pf, is\n1.\nSecs. 3.9 & 3.10\n3.17\n\nIDj\nm\nFi = Ei ax\n+ E\ni i k=l\naw\naak\na-k axi\nm\nW\nE\na\n-\naxi\nk-1 k ak\nThe goal in the following manipulations is to express this equation in the form of a tensor divergence\n(in the form of Eq. 3.9.1).\nThe second term can be replaced by Eq. 3.7.26.

For an isolated object in free space, this force\nis the same regardless of the particular force density used. If the force is considered as the integral\nof the force density over the volume of the object, this fact is by no means obvious. But, note that in\nfree space the stress tensors of Table 3.10.1 all agree, Because the enclosing surface S is in this\nfree space region, the same total force will result from integrating Eq. 3.9.6 regardless of the force\ndensity associated with the stress tensor.\n3.11 Surface Force Density\nIn many systems, the electric or magnetic force density is concentrated in a thin layer, usually\ncomprising the interface between two regions.\nIf the thickness of this layer is small compared to the\ndimensions of the adjacent regions and other lengths of interest, then the force per unit area on the\ninterface may be used to describe the layer. An interfacial section is enclosed by the incremental\nvolume of thickness A and area A = 6x6y, shown in Fig. 3.11.1. The surface force density is defined\nas a force per unit area of the interface in a limit in which first A and then A approach zero. The\nintegration of the electric force density throughout the control volume is convenient-y carried out\nusing the appropriate stress tensor Tij integrated over the enclosing surface. With n defined as the\nunit normal to the interface and tn the unit normal to the control surface, the surface force density is\n0+\nflim 1\n-'n\n=\nn\nlim 1\nT\nIT\nda =\nU\nn +\nT.1 dvdt\n(1)\nA+0 A\nnn\nAO A\n0-\nn\nA+0\nS\nIntegration is divided into two parts. The first is the contribution from the surfaces external to the\nlayer, having normals n and -n, respectively. The second accounts for the \"edges\" of the volume where\nthe surface cuts through the double layer.\nIf fields within the layer are of the same order as those\noutside, contributions of the second integral vanish as A + 0. In electroquasistatic systems, the\ndouble layer presents a case where the internal fields are sufficiently intense that the second term\nnot only makes a.contribution but one that can dominate the first term. The remainder of this section\nis devoted to converting this contribution to a more useful form.\nThe distance normal to the interface is y, with (p,y) orthogonal coordinates in the local inter-\nfacial plane, as shown in Fig. 3.11.1. In the absence of a double layer, the electric field is of the\nsame order of magnitude throughout, and hence in the limit A + 0, the second term in Eq. 1 becomes\nnegligible compared to the first. With the double layer, the stress contributions from the edges of\nthe control volume are of the same order as those from the exterior surfaces.\nAs discussed in Sec. 2.10, the tangential electric field suffers a discontinuity through the\ndouble layer. However, the tangential field within the layer is of the same order as the external\nfield. Because the thickness A over which the interior stresses act is much smaller than the linear\ndimensions 65 and 6d, the internal stress contributions to the integrations around the periphery of\nthe control volume are ignorable unless the double-layer charges are themselves responsible for a sub-\nstantially larger internal field than external field. This double-layer-generated field is directed\nnormal to the interface and dominates in determining the interior stresses. The stress taken now as\nrepresented by Eq. 3.7.19b of Table 3.10.1 is\nTij = EiD\nJ\n-\nijW'\n(2)\nwhere, in the case of a linearly polarized dielectric, the coenergy density W' is simply -E2/2.

The surface force density associated with surface tension takes this same form. However,\nthe convention used in Chap. 7 is with the radii of curvature the negatives of R1 and R2 .\nWith the\nunderstanding that R1 and R2 are radii of curvature taken as positive if the center of curvature is on\nthe side of the interface out of which A is directed, Eqs. 1, 4, and 7 give the surface force density,\nwith the double-layer contribution represented by the function yE,\n- = 0 1 D . -\n-\n-y-\n1 ~ 2\n+VT\n+\nn\nn\n[+1\nE R\nR2\nEEE\nwhere\nYE\nO W'dv\n0-\nIt is shown in Sec. 7.6 that the second term in Eq. 8 can also be expressed as -YE(V.n)n.\nThe double layer surface force density is exemplified in Chap. 10.\nSec. 3.11\nno+\nn\n3.20\n\n3.12\nObservations\nThe force densities and associated stress tensors of Table 3.10.1 are of two origins. The Kelvin\nforce densities, the last two in the table, come from a microscopic picture of particles and dipoles\nsubject to electric or magnetic forces which, through the agent of a kinetic equilibrium, are passed\nalong to the ponderable continuum. The Korteweg-Helmholz force densities, all of the others in the\ntable, are based on an energy conservation principle. The connection between micro and macro fields,\nneeded to apply this principle is made using electrical measurements of constitutive laws to inter-\nrelate the macroscopic fields A and t or B and A.\nThe arguments underlying each type of force density envoke certain assumptions which point to\npossible inadequacies. The Kelvin force densities picture the force acting on each dipole and each\npoint chargl in isolation and this force as being that transmitted to the ponderable media. This does\nnot allow for the possibility that the micro fields of one dipole contribute to the force on a neigh-\nboring dipole.\nThis shortcoming is obviated by the energy method, which is based on a statement of energy con-\nservation for an electromechanical subsystem. The resulting Korteweg-Helmholtz force densities 1 are\nof course also restricted. On the one hand, they are more broadly applicable than might be concluded\nfrom the derivations.\nFor example, the MQS continuum is viewed as \"perfectly conducting,\" but the\nfree current force density is certainly applicable in cases where the conductivity is finite. This is\nevident from its agreement with the Lorentz force density of Sec. 3.1, because the later model in-\ncludes a finite mobility and hence electrical dissipation.\nOne way to derive a force density without ambiguity as to the validity of the result in noncon-\nservative systems is to replace statements of energy conservation with those of power flow. 2 However,\nthe principle of virtual power requires information beyond that required by the principle of virtual\nwork used here. In addition to the constitutive laws relating the macroscopic field variables is the\nrequirement for the power flux density, which must either be assumed or measured.\nUnderlying all of the discussions in this chapter has been the presumption that a clear distinc-\ntion can be made between electric or magnetic force densities and those of other origins.\nThis is\ntantamount to being able to isolate electromagnetic energy storage from other forms of energy storage.\nPiezoelectric coupling is an example where it is not fruitful to make this distinction. In that area,\nthe stress and force density generally represent combined electric and mechanical electromechanical\neffects.\nSec. 3.12\n1. J. A.
