Explores the communicative power of performances with attention to the ways performers, media, cultural settings, and audiences interact. Also considers the ways the representation of cultural difference is altered through processes of globalization. Performances viewed live when possible, but the course also relies on video, audio, and online materials as necessary. There are no prerequisites for this course and it is taught in english.\n\nCourse Aims\n\nPaying particular attention to gendered constructions of \"Asian\" identity, we will consider a variety of approaches to performance and culture. What does \"Asian\" mean in the popular imagination and in scholarly research? How can we learn more about how images of Asia and Asians are constructed by attending to theories of performance? Looking at the intersection of three terms \"Asian / Performance / Cultures,\" we will examine the ways that identities are always caught between shifting actors and audiences, settings and economies, and explore what this tells us about how culture and identity changing in a globalizing world.\n\nOne premise of the course is that working at the intersection of Asian Studies and Women's Studies can provide insights for both fields. As Judith Butler argues, gender itself is not a core essence, but something that emerges from \"performance,\" both on- and off-stage, which then constitute patterned understandings of masculine, feminine, transgendered, and so on. How can such a perspective enhance our understanding of the ways \"Asianness\" is constituted? Interestingly, many of the contrasts that are used to compare men and women are reproduced in comparing the West and Asia. Consider, for example, the ways \"men/the West\" are supposedly rational, individualistic, and competitive while \"women/Asia\" are allegedly emotional, group-oriented, and harmonious. The construction of national identities frequently, if not always, entails gendered characteristics, and this dynamic will be a key theme for exploring Asian performances. We will look not only at live performances, but also at various media and other spaces (such as museums) where images of Asia are portrayed.\n\nCourse Topics\n\nThe course will focus on Japan, but include performances related to other areas of Asia. Students will also be asked to identify some kind of Asian performance to explore for their final project (presentation and paper). Some of the particular performances and media that we will examine include:\n\nThe all-female Takarazuka Revue (Japan) which presents elaborate romantic musicals, yet contradictory lessons for empowering women,\n\nThe film\nKing of Masks\n(China) which portrays an elderly male street performer trying to find a male heir for his art, and who is helped by a male actor who only plays female roles, and whose adopted protege comes with surprises,\n\nSamurai imagery in an American film,\nThe Last Samurai\nand a Japanese film\nTwilight Samurai\n, which offer very different portraits of relations between the sexes and the character of the samurai ethos,\n\nJapanese popular music, with an emphasis on Japanese hip-hop and the contrasts between male and female rappers, but also considering forms like\nenka\n, where men commonly sing from a women's perspective and vice versa, and the New Japan series of CDs on John Zorn's Tzadik label,\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts in Boston has a tremendous range of Asian artifacts, and striking differences in the ways that different civilizations are portrayed. Why are kimono and samurai swords so prevalent for Japan, yet China is more commonly shown through pottery and scholars' stones?\n\nCourse Requirements and Schedule of Major Assignments\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass Participation\n\n15%\n\nEssay 1 (5 pages, Week 5)\n\n15%\n\nEssay 2 (5 pages, Week 9)\n\n20%\n\nEssay 3 - Due Final Class (7-8 Pages)\n\n25%\n\nIn-class Presentations (Weeks 10-13)\n\n25%\n\nGrading of Written Work\n\nEssays are designed to encourage students to engage with the theoretical propositions of the course, while also taking a comprehensive and analytical look at the materials. Written work will be graded according to three criteria:\n\nArgument\n: Is there a coherent thesis? How clearly is the argument stated in the introduction and developed throughout the paper? Do the steps of the argument make sense and lead logically to the conclusion?\n\nEvidence\n: How well does the essay use the evidence available from the class materials (readings, lectures, films)? Are there contradictory examples that should be discussed to eliminate doubts?\n\nStyle\n: How well is the paper written? Has it been carefully proofread? Does the paper length match the assignment?",

What is \"real hip-hop\" or \"real\njazz\"? Can women playing men's roles really perform in a convincing way? Can men\nthat play women's roles capture an authentic feminine reality? Or are there limits to the\npersuasiveness of performance that we can identify in terms of authenticity? For\nexample, people argue that ethnicity, gender, race are, to some extent, performed, but are\nthere limitations on how persuasive those performances can be?\n\nWith these issues in mind, use the course materials (readings, films, lectures, outside\nevents) to discuss one of the following questions:\n\n1) How important is authenticity for understanding the power of cultural\nperformances?\n\n2) Is authenticity important for some performances and not others? If so, what's the\ndifference?\n\n3) Do all expressions of identity depend on an idea of authenticity? Or does the\nquality of performative power, regardless of authenticity, the key factor in cultural\ninfluence?\n\nPlease make sure you deal with at least some of the arguments in Jennifer Robertson's\nbook. I would also like you to consider, to some extent, the materials on jazz and hip-\nhop, as well as Tak Toyoshima's comments related to Asian-American and other\nidentities. I can imagine ways to incorporate discussions of the Chineseness of the\nBeijing Film Academy's anime shorts. Of course, Beijing Opera, King of Masks, and\nanime are relevant as well, though I would like these examples to take up less space.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n21G.067J / WGS.608J Cultural Performances of Asia\nFall 2005\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
