      "content": "22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nProblem set # 2\nIssued on Monday Sept 24, 2012. Due on Monday Oct. 8, 2012\nProblem 1: Neutron Interferometry\n|U〉\n|L〉\nBS\nBS\nFigure 1: Neutron Interferometer\nConsider a neutron interferometer (NI), such as the Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the figure. We send in a beam of\nneutrons. We assume that the flux of neutrons is so low (neutrons can be very slow) so that only one neutron is present\nat any time inside the interferometer. The first beamsplitter divides the neutron flux into two parts, that will go into\nthe upper arm or the lower arm. The lower and upper beams are then reflected at the mirrors and recombined at the\nsecond beam splitter, after which the neutron flux is measured at one arm. We assume that both beamsplitter works in\nthe same way, delivering an equal flux to each arm (that is, the transmission and reflection are the same).\na) Define the (minimal) Hilbert space describing this problem (e.g. give the basis spanning the space)\nb) What is the propagator describing the action of the Beamsplitter?\nc) What is the state at the position 1, assuming the neutron was initially traveling upward before entering the NI?\nd) What is the probability of observing a neutron in the upper arm detector?\ne) We now introduce an object in the lower path. This modifies the momentum of the neutron, and its effect is seen\nas an added phase to the neutrons passing through the lower path. Write the operator describing this phase shift and\ncalculate again the probability of measuring a neutron at the upper path detector.\nf) The usual signal for interferometers is the contrast C = |(SU -SL)/(SU + SL)|, where SU(SL) is the signal (# of\nneutrons) at the upper(lower) detector. Indeed, this is always necessary since we need to calibrate and normalized the\nsignal. What is the contrast for the neutron interferometer if the added phase (see previous question) is φ = π/2?\nBonus: what is the operator describing the observable measured by the contrast?\nProblem 2: Pure vs. Mixed States\nConsider again the NI of Problem 1:. We previously assumed that the beam of neutrons all had the same (upward)\nmomentum |ψ(0)) = |U). However, if the neutrons arrive from a reactor, we might not be able to control their initial\nstate.\nb) Assume the neutrons can be represented by a mixed-state, with 50-50 probability of having initially an upward |U)\nor downward |L) momentum. What is the operator describing this state?\nc) For the initial state described above, what is the measured contrast for the same condition as in Problem 1:.f?\nCompare this result to the answer you found previously: is it possible to distinguish the two initial states from this\n\nmeasurement? If not, propose another measurement that would distinguish the two cases.\ne) Consider a more abstract question: For the family of pure states represented by |θ) = (|+) + eiθ |-))/\n√\n2 , and\nthe non-pure state ρ = 1\n2(|+) (+| + |-) (-|) we have (σx) = 0. Thus a measurement of σx cannot distinguish the\n\ntwo states. How would you differentia√\nte one state from another (with an appropriate measurement)? [On notations:\nwe define the states |±) = (|0) ± |1))/ 2, where |0), |1) are as usual the eigenstates of the σz operator.]\nProblem 3: Mixed state on the Bloch sphere\n\na)\n\nThe purity of a state ρ is defined as Tr\n{\nρ2}\n. Show that Tr ρ2\n≤ 1, with the equality only if ρ is a pure state.\nb) How does this condition translate to the Bloch vector nn of\n{\na tw\n}\no-state system? (recall that a TLS density state can\n\nalways be expressed as ρ = 1\n2(11 + nn\n\n· nσ).)\n√\neiπ/3\nc) What are the Bloch vectors for |1)(1|, |-) (-|, ρ =\n\n5 √\n\nand |ψ)(ψ| (where\n|ψ\n=\n-\n|1) +\niπ/\n\n)\n(\ne\n|+))/\np\n2 +\n√\n2)? What is (σy) in in each case ?\nProblem 4: Operators on composite systems\nWrite the operator matrix representations for the operator σA = σA ⊗1\nA\nB\ny\ny\nB and σx ⊗σz , where each operator is defined\non the respective Hilbert space HA and HB (each spanned by the identity plus the Pauli matrices) and the operators\nyou are looking for are defined on the tensor product space HA ⊗HB.\nProblem 5: Creation of entanglement\ncos(θ/2)\ne-iφ sin(θ/2)\na) Consider the unitary operator U(θ, φ) =\nthe following states is entangled and which o\n\nne\n-e iφ sin(θ/2)\ncos(θ/2)\nis separable?\n\nin the usual basis |0 ), |1 ). Which of\n1. [U(θ1, φ1) ⊗U(θ1, φ1)] |00)\n2. [U(θ1, φ1) ⊗U(θ2, φ2)](\n√\n|00) + |01))/ 2\n3. [U(θ1, φ1)\n√\n⊗U(θ2, φ2)](|00) -|11))/ 2\n[Notice that you should be able to give an answer even without making any calculation!]\nb) Consider the Hamiltonian H = aσxσx + (1 -a)σyσy.\n1. Are its eigenstates entangled? (you can use your favorite math program to diagonalize the matrix).\n2. Consider the initial state |00). What is the rate of creation of entanglement by the Hamiltonian above? [Take\nfor example as an entanglement measure the purity of the reduced state. Give an analytical expression and then\nyou calculate the rate using your favorite program (it can also be done by hand)]\nProblem 6: Evolution of 2 TLS\n\na) For the two qubit state |ψ(0)) = √1\n2(|0)+|1))\n0 , calculate the final state ψ(t) evolving under the Hamiltonian\n\nH = ωσ1\n⊗| )\n|\n)\nσ\nz\nz. Is the state ever entangled?\nb) Consider the state |ψ(t)) that you found above. What is the time evolution of its concurrence? What is the purity\nof the reduced density operator at each instant in time?\nc) What if the Hamiltonian is instead H = ωσ1\nzσy? (give again the time evolution of the system and whether entan\nglement is created, by calculating one entanglement measure.)\n\nProblem 7: Spin-1 precession\nConsider the spin-precession problem for a spin-1 system. Denote by |-1) , |0), |+1) the states with spin angular\nmomentum along z {-1, 0, +1} respectively (in units of ~). The Hamiltonian for a spin 1-system subjected to an\nexternal magnetic field B (setting ~ = 1) is\nH = S · γB + ΔS2\nz\nwhere γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and Δ is the so-called zero-field splitting or it could be a quadrupolar interaction\nterm. Take B to be static, and we set it along the z-axis direction.\na) Using the Hadamard formula\nxA\ne\nBe-xA = B + [A, B]x +\n[A, [A, B]]x +\n[A, [A, [A, B]]]x + . . .\n2!\n3!\niSz φS\n-iSz\niS2 φ\n-iSz\n2 φ\nz\nevaluate e\nxe\nφ and e\nSxe\n.\nb) Using the Heisenberg picture, find (Sx,y,x) as a function of time assuming the spin was initially in the state |ψ) =\n√\n(|0) + |+1))/ 2.\nProblem 8: Rabi oscillation for Spin 1\nConsider the problem of a spin system in the presence of a sinusoidal oscillating time-dependent potential: in class\nwe have used the interaction picture to solve this problem for a TLS. [This is just a reminder] Consider then a more\ngeneral problem in which we add a (small) time-dependent magnetic field along the transverse direction (e.g. x-axis):\nBn (t) = Bzzˆ + 2B1 cos(ωt)xˆ = Bzzˆ + B1 [(cos(ωt)xˆ + sin(ωt)yˆ) + (cos(ωt)xˆ -sin(ωt)yˆ)] ,\nwhere B1 is the strength of the radio-frequency (for nuclei) or microwave (for electron) field.\n′\nThe Hamiltonian of the system H = H0 + H1(t) + H1(t) is then:\nω0\nω1\nω1\nH =\nσz +\n[cos(ωt)σx + sin(ωt)σy] +\n[cos(ωt)σx -sin(ωt)σy] ,\nwhere we defined the rf frequency ω1. We already know the eigenstates of H0 (|0) and |1)). Thus we use the interaction\n- ωσz\npicture to simplify the Hamiltonian, with U0 = e\ni\n/2 defining a frame rotating about the z-axis at a frequency ω:\n+\nthis is the so-called rotating frame. Remembering that U0σzU\n= cos(ωt)σx + sin(ωt)σy, it's easy to see that the\n+\nω1\n′\n+\n′\nperturbation Hamiltonian in the interaction frame is H1I = U0 H1U0 =\n2 σx. We also have H\n= U0 H1U0 =\n1I\nω1 (cos(2ωt)σx -sin(2ωt)σy). Under the assumptions that ω1 ≪ ω, this is a small, fast oscillating term, that quickly\naverages out during the evolution of the system and thus can be neglected. This approximation is called the rotating\nwave approximation (RWA). Under the RWA, the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame simplifies to\nΔω\nω1\nHI =\nσz +\nσx\nwhere Δω = ω0 -ω. Now we want to solve the same problem for a spin-1 system. The Hamiltonian of the system\nH = H0 + V (t) is :\nH = ΔS2 + ω0Sz + 2ω1 cos(ωt)Sx,\nz\n-iωtS 2\nz\na) Set ω0 = 0. Using the result in Problem 7:, make a transformation to the rotating frame U0 = e\n(consider\nthe on resonance case for simplicity) and neglect any remaining time-dependent terms (rotating wave approximation).\n\nHint: you can express the oscillating field as a sum of \"counter-rotating\" fields U0\n+SxU 0 and U0SxU0\n+\n, of which you\ncalculate in Problem 7: the explicit expression (although these do not describe real counter-rotating fields as in the\nspin-1/2 case, but are more of a mathematical trick here).\nd) Assuming the spin is initially in the state |0), what are the probability of being in the state |0) and |±1) as a function\nof time? What is the probability of being in the state ( +1 +\n1 )/\n√\n|\n)\n|-)\n2? What about the state ( +\n√\n| 1 ) -|-1))/\n2?\ne) Now we set ω0 = 0 and we would like to only populate the states |0) and |1) (i.e. p\n1(t) = 0). To do so we set\n-\nω = Δ + ω0, and we go into the rotating frame as above. What is the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame?\nf) Assuming that ω0 ≫ ω1, show that |-1) is never populated (you can just give an intuitive explanation without\ndoing any calculation)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nFall 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The atoms can be in two\npossible states |g) or |e) (the ground and excited states).\nThe Box B prepares a flux of atoms in their ground state. We\nwill consider the evolution of a single atom from that initial\nstate.\na) The Ramsey cavity R1 operates on the atoms with the Hamiltonian\nHR1 = iΩR(|e) (g| -|g) (e|)\nThe atoms take a time tR = π/(ΩR4) to traverse the Ramsey cavity (during which time they experience the\nHamiltonian above). In the cavity C, the atom interacts for a time tC with the electro-magnetic field, with\nan Hamiltonian\nHC = nω(|g) (g| -|e) (e|)\nwhere n is the number of photons in the cavity itself (either 0 or 1). Finally, the second Ramsey cavity R2\nhas an Hamiltonian that is similar to R1:\nHR2 = -iΩR(|e) (g| -|g) (e|)\nand it takes the same time tR = π/(ΩR4) for the atom to traverse this Ramsey cavity.\nWhat is the atom's state after the first Ramsey cavity?\nWhat is the probability of finding the atom in the state |g) at the detector D?\nReprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd:\nNature. Source: Gleyzes, Sebastien, et al. \"Quantum\njumps of light recording the birth and death of a photon\nin a cavity.\" Nature 446, 297-300, (c) 2007.\n2012.\n\nb) Now consider the e.m. field in the cavity C as a quantum mechanical system. Under the experiment\nconditions, the field is such that there's at most one photon in the cavity (that is, either 0 or 1 photons).\nWith HA the atom and He.m. the photon Hilbert space, what is a basis for the Hilbert space H = HA ⊗He.m.?\nWhat is the Hamiltonian HC for the interaction of the atom with the photon in the cavity?\nc) Assume that initially we do not know how many photons are in the cavity, but only that it is more\nprobable to have zero photons (with 75% of probability). The atom is in the state you found in question (a).\nWhat is the state of the atom-photon system at the instant in which the atom enters the cavity C?\nd) The atom stays in the cavity for a time t = π/(2ω). We then detect the atom (at the detector D after\npassing in the Ramsey cavity R2) and find that it's in the state |e). What does this tell us about the number\nof photons in the cavity?\n[Hint: You might be able to give an answer even without doing any calculations.]\nThis is the method used in the paper to indirectly measure the photon number (either 0 or 1) by looking at\nthe state of the atom. Even if we do not know a priori the number of photons in the cavity, we can infer it\nfrom the measurement of the atom's state.\ne) If we now assume the field is initially in a superposition state √1 (|0) +\n\n|1)) (and the atom still in the\nground state |g) before the first Ramsey cavity), is the final state entangled?\nWhat would be the correlation between measuring the atom in the excited (ground) state and measuring\none (zero) photons?\nProblem 3:\nTripartite entanglement\n\nConsider the GHZ and W states of three spin- 1. The GHZ state is defined as\n\n|GHZ\n\n) = (\n\n√\n|000) + |\n))/ 2\nwhile the W state is: |W ) = (|100) + |010) + |001))/\n√\n3. These are representatives of two independent classes\nof entangled state for tripartite systems (that is, any tripartite entangled state can be rotated into either a\nGHZ or W states by local operations on the single qubits, but we cannot go from one GHZ state to a W\nstate with local operations).\na) What is the final state of the two remaining spins if you loose (trace over) one spin ?\nb) What is the purity and entanglement of the reduced states?\nProblem 4:\nElectron and Nuclear Spins: Magnetization\nConsider an electron with spin- 1 , placed in a large\nB\nmagnetic field B = BzBz at zero temperature. The spin\nis in the state\n|ψ) = c0|↑) + c1|↓)\n~\n~\nwhere |↑) ≡Sz = +\n(|↓) ≡Sz = -\n) represents the spin state aligned (anti-aligned) with the z-axis.\na) If the the\n\nspin is in\n\nits ground\n\nstate,\n\nwhat are c0 and c1? What is the average magnetization (μz )?\n[Assume that the only interaction is the Zeeman interaction, HZ = (γBz σz/2]\nb) Now assume that we cannot achieve zero temperature, but only the liquid Nitrogen temperature T = 77K,\nso\n\nB\nthat the spin is at thermal equilibrium in the field B = BzBz. What is the state of the spin?\nc) What is the average magnetization? How many spins would you need in order to achieve the same\nmagnetization as in question (a) if the magnetic field is Bz ≈ 6T?\nd) Consider now nuclear spins in a molecule. Each molecule has two spins 1/2 that interact via an\nHamiltonian H = Jσ1σ2\nz\nz /4, while we can neglect the interaction among spins of different molecules. The\nmolecules are at room temperature in a large magnetic field Bz. What is the equilibrium density operator\nand polarization in the high temperature limit?\n\nProblem 5:\nMeasurement and Decoherence\nWe are interested in describing the quantum behavior of a particle -such as an atom or a ion- which is\nconfined in a double well potential. The particle can be in either the left or right well. It has energy\nER = E0 - ΔE in the right well and energy EL = E0 + ΔE in the left well. The barrier between the two\nwells is not very high, so the particle can tunnel between the two wells at a rate Γ. We neglect all degrees\nof freedom and characteristics of the particle, except for its position (either left or right). You can set for\nsimplicity E0 = 0 and ( = 1.\n2ΔE\nΓ\nL\nR\nΓ\nL\nR\nI\nFigure 1: Left: Double well system. Right: Double well with ΔE = 0 and photons going through the left\nwell.\na) What is the Hamiltonian describing the tunneling, HT ? What is the total Hamiltonian - describing the\ntunneling and the energy of the particle in the two wells?\nb) To measure if the particle is in the left well, we send in a photon. The photon, initially in the ground\nstate |0), interacts with the particle (only if the particle is in the left well) and is promoted to the state |1).\n(If the photon had been in the state |1) the scattering would have demoted it to the state |0)). What is the\nunitary operator U describing the combined transformation of the particle and photon? Is measuring the\nstate of the photon after this interaction a good way of measuring the particle's position?\n\nc) Assume the particle is initially in the state |ψ) = (\n√\n|R) + |L))/ 2. If the photon (initially in the ground\nstate |0)) interacts with the particle, is the combined state of the photon and particle entangled? (assume\nthe photon-particle interaction happens instantaneously).\nd) Now assume that the photon detector we used in (a-b) is faulty: it absorbs the photon but does not\nrecord the state of the photon. What is the reduced state of the particle\n\nafter the measurement? (here again,\nassume that the particle was in the state\n√\n|ψ) = (|R) + |L))/ 2 before the interaction with the photon).\ne) As our photon detector is faulty, we decide not to measure the particle. Unfortunately, we cannot\ncompletely block the photons from entering the left well: there is still a flux of photons with intensity I.\nEach photon, initially in the ground state |0) interacts with the particle (only if the particle is in the left\nwell) and with a probability p = Iδt is scattered by the particle and is promoted to the state |1).

Due on Monday Nov. 5, 2012\nProblem 1:\nNMR relaxation\nConsider an ensemble of spin-1/2 particles (a liquid NMR sample) in the presence of a static inhomogeneous magnetic\nfield iB(z) that leads to the following Hamiltonian H(z):\n~\niB(z) = (B0 + az)z ˆ =⇒ H(z) =\n(ω0 + Gz)σz\n(1)\na) Since we detect the magnetization of the whole sample as an effective one spin-1/2 particle, the corresponding\ndensity matrix is an average over the spatial variation:\nρ(t) =\n\np(z)ρ(z, t)dz with p(z) = 1/L for |z| < L/2 (and zero otherwise.)\n(2)\nwhere ρ(z, t) is the evolution of the system under H(z). Find ρ(t) for an arbitrary initial state.\nb) Show that this process can also be described equivalently by a Kraus set given by\n\nsin GtL/2\nE1 =\n-\nσz exp(-iω0tσz/2)\n(3)\nGtL\n\nsin GtL/2\nE2 =\n+\nexp(-iω0tσz/2)\n(4)\nGtL\nWhat interpretation can you give to this process? Is this Kraus set unique?\nProblem 2:\nEvolution of a TLS coupled to a two-level environment\nObtain an expression for the Kraus operators that describe the evolution of a single TLS (\"system S\") that is coupled to\nanother TLS (\"environment, E\") which we are not interested in observing. The full evolution of the complete system\nis given by the Hamiltonian\nH = Jσ(S) ⊗σ(E)\nz\nz\na) What are the Kraus operators?\nb) What is the evolution of qubit S alone?\nc) Now consider the hamiltonian\nHSE = Jσ(S) ⊗σ(E)\nz\ny\nFind again the Kraus operators and write down the evolved state. Is the evolution of qubit S unitary in this case?\nd) Compare this problem to problem 6 in PSet2. How is the character (unitary or not) of the reduced system evolution\nconnected to the creation of entanglement between system and environment? Comment.\n\nProblem 3:\nGeneralized amplitude damping\nConsider a map given by the following Kraus set\n0 √\n√\nγ\n√\n\n√\n\nV\n\n1 -γ0\n0 0\nE0 =\np\n√\n, E1 =\np\n, E2 =\n1 -p\n\n, E =\np\n1 -γ\n0 0\nV\n-\n\n√ γ0\n\nwith 0 < {γ, p} < 1\na) For an arbitrary initial state ρ(0) = (11 + in(0) · iσ)/2, find in(1), that gives the state of the system after one step of\nthe map ρ(1) = S[ρ(0)]. Visualize this in the Bloch sphere: what is happening to the Bloch vector in?\nb) Consider now p = 1/2. Find in(k) for the state after k steps. Again, visualize this in the Bloch sphere: what is\nhappening to in(k)?\nc) Set γ = Γδt and k = t/δt. Write the system's state at a time t, ρ(t) = S(t)[ρ(0)] that you found above. If the\nP\n+P vˆ Oσ\nTLS has initially a polarization\n(i.e. the state is ρ =\n· , with vˆ a unit vector) what is the polarization P ′ of the\nevolved state ρ(t)? What is the state of the system when t →inf? What is its entropy then?\nc) For unitary evolution of a state, we can invert the evolution of the system by going \"back in time\" with the\nsubstitution t →-t. [If U = e-iHt, applying t →-t we have eiHt = U + = U -1, and ρ(-t) = U +ρU is still a valid\ndensity operator].\nNow consider the superoperator evolution defined above, which gives the evolved state ρ(t) = S(t)[ρ(0)]. What is the\npolarization of the evolved state if we go back in time (by inverting the sign, t →-t)? Is the state still a good valid\ndensity operator?\nProblem 4:\nLindblad forms\nConsider a two-level system governed by a Hamiltonian H = - ~ωσz/2. Its interaction with the environment is\nrepresented by a single Lindblad operator L1 = √ ασ-, where σ- = |0)(1| is called lowering operator, and α is the\nrate at which this process occurs.\na) Write out the Lindblad equation for this process.\nb) Move to an interaction picture where the system is described by ρ = eiHt/nρe-iHt/n. Find a new Lindblad equation\nfor ρ .\nc) Proposing a solution of the form ρ (t) = (11 + in(t) · iσ)/2, find in(t)\n[Hint: notice that in general nα = Tr {ρσα}, with α = {x, y, z}].\nProblem 5:\nEntanglement decay\nConsider the paper Sudden Death of Entanglement by Ting Yu and J. H. Eberly,\nOn the first page, at the top of the 3rd column the authors state: Entanglement of idealized cats could be denoted with\na bracket such as [(Ws) ⇐⇒ (Sw)], where we have chosen large and small letters to distinguish a big cat from a\nlittle cat.\na) How would you write down this state with the usual Dirac notation? Choose a suitable basis and write down the\nequivalent state for two atoms being in the ground and excited states (instead of sleeping and awake).\nOn page 2, first column, the authors describe the decay process: In the case of spontaneous emission there is no\nenvironment at all, except for the vacuum. The vacuum can still have a noisy degrading effect through its quantum\nfluctuations, which cannot be avoided, so both atoms in Fig. 1 must eventually lose their excitation and come to their\nground states with the rate Γ.\nb) Consider 1 atom only. Which of the 3 processed studied in class (dephasing, polarization damping and amplitude\ndamping) are the authors describing?\nWrite the Kraus operators using p = 1 -e-Γt, as in figure (2) .\nc) Now assume the environment (the vacuum of the e.m. field) acts independently and simultaneously on the two\nħ\n\natoms. Write the Kraus operators for the composite system. [Hint: That means that you should take all the possible\ncombinations of the Kraus for the two systems].\nd) Write the system evolution in terms of these Kraus operators, for a system initially in the state ∝|eg) + |ge).\n[where e and g indicate the excited and ground state of the atoms.]\ne) What is the evolution of the entanglement?\n[Note: as we are dealing with a mixed state, you should calculate an entanglement measure such as the Concurrence.\nYou can do that e.g. numerically or with Mathematica. Otherwise, for simplicity, you can just calculate the purity of\nthe reduced system and take as an estimate of entanglement 1-Purity= 1 -Tr {ρ1}, with ρ1 = Tr2 {ρ}]\nProblem 6:\nSpin Echo with random field\nWe have seen in class that dephasing can arise from an inhomogeneous magnetic field, such that each element in the\nensemble of spins has a slightly different frequency ω. Under the action of an external field, the spins precess and if\nthe field is inhomogenous they acquired different phases φ(t) = γB(z)t = ω(z)t:\nS[ρ] =\n\ndφ p(φ)e -iφσz /2ρeiφσz /2 =\n\\\ne -iφσz /2ρeiφσz /2)\nwhere p(φ) is the probability of the phase φ.\na) Assume ρ(0) =\n(11 + Pσx). What is ρ(τ) = S[ρ, τ] ?\nb) We now apply a π-pulse (that is, an operation that exchange |0) with |1), such as σx) at the time τ/2, so that the\ntotal evolution is : free precession from t = 0 → t = τ/2, π-pulse, free precession from t = τ/2 → t = τ (the pulse\ntakes no time). This is a spin echo sequence. What is ρ(τ) in this case?\nt\nc) How does your answer change if φ(t) =\nJ\nω(t ′ )dt, with a time-varying frequency ω(t)?\nd) You should have found a term\n∝\n\\\n(\nτ/\ncos\nJ\n2 dt ω(t) -\nτ\ndt ω(t)\n))\n. For any Gaussian stationary variable θ\nτ/2\n-θ\n/2\nwith (θ) = 0,\n(\neiθ)\n= e (\n)\n. What is ρ(τ), if ω(t) is a\nJ\nGaussian stationary variable with (ω) = 0?

Due on Friday Dec. 7, 2012\nProblem 1: The dipolar approximation\nWe have seen in class that the Hamiltonian for the interaction of atoms and radiation fields is given by\np2\ne2\nA2\ne A\nH =\n+\n-\nA · Ap\n2m\n2mc2\nmc\nin the Coulomb gauge.

A cantilever with a magnetic tip is positioned closed to a spin- 1 (of gyromagnetic ratio γ) in a strong\nexternal magnetic field B along the z-direction. The magnetic tip creates a magnetic gradient Gz such that the field felt by the spin\ndepends on the position of the tip itself, Btot = B + Gzz. In the limit of small displacements, the cantilever can be modeled as an\nharmonic oscillator of mass m, oscillating along the z direction at its natural frequency ωc.\nSpin\nCantilever\nFigure 1: A cantilever coupled to a spin.

We can\nexpress the z-basis eigenkets in terms of this new basis as |0) = √ 1 (|+\n)\n) + |-)) and |1) = √ 1 ( +\n. Thus:\n2 | ) -|-)\n|ψ) = α|0) + β|1) = √ [α(|+) + |-)) + β(|+) -|-)) = √ (α + β)|+) + √ (α -β)\n|-)\nThen p(x > 0) = |(+|ψ)|2 = |α + β|2/2\nb) (σy) = (ψ|σy|ψ) with σy = i(|1)(0| -|0)(1|). Expanding the ket, we find\n(σy) = i(α∗ (0| + β ∗(1|)(|1)(0| -|0)(1|)(α|0) + β|1)) = -i(α∗ β -β ∗ α) = 2Im(α∗ β)\nProblem 2 Operators on composite systems\n10 points\nWe have seen in class how to calculate e-iσz φ by expanding the exponential as a series:\n=\nL 1\ne -iσz φ\n(-iσzφ)k =\n( iφ)k11 +\n( iφ)kσz = cos(φ)11\ni sin(φ)σz\nk!\nk!\nk!\nk\nk,\nL\neven\n-\nk\nL\n,odd\n-\n-\nwhere we used the fact that (σ\nz) = 11. In general e-iφfn·fσ = 11 cos(φ) -inn · nσ sin(φ)\nNow we consider a system composed of two subsystems H = H1 ⊗H2, each being a two-level system. To describe operators\non the two subsystems we normally use the shorthanded notations A1 ≡ A1 ⊗112 and B2 ≡ 111 ⊗B2 and A1B2 ≡ A1 ⊗B2 .\na) What is (σ1σ2)2\nz\nz\n?\nb) Consider the operator U = e-\niσ2\niσ φ⊗\n\nz\ne-\n\nz φ: to which operator is this equivalent to, U\n= e-i(σ1+σ2)φ\n-iσ1σ2\n+\nz\nz\nor U\n= e\nz\nz φ?\n×\nSolution\nThis problem can be solved almost without any calculation (and without writing the explicit matrix representation)\na) (σ1σ2)2 = (σ1\nz\nz\nz ⊗σ2 2(σ1 2\n2 2\nz)\nz) ⊗(σz) = 11 ⊗11 = 11 (where the last identity is on the composite system).\n\nb) Since σ1 and σ2\nz\nz commute, we can do calculations as if they just were numbers. For exponential functions we know that\nthe product of two exponentials is the exponential of the sum of the arguments. (Of course this is not valid when the operators\ndo not commute). So we simply had:\n\ne-iσ1\nz φ ⊗e-iσ2\nzφ\n-iσ1\n= e\nz φe-iσ2\nz φ = e-i(σ1\nz+σz )φ.\nNotice that\n-\nU\n= e\niσzσzφ is NOT an operator that acts separately on the two subsystems (i.e. it cannot be written for all\n×\nphases as A1 ⊗ B2, where A1(B2) acts on the first (second) space). Thus it is also an operator that can create entanglement\n(starting from a separable state).\nWith the formula above for the exponential and knowing that (σ1σ2 2\nz\nz)\n= 11 you could have also calculated explicitly (and\nquickly!) all the exponentials and verified the result.\n-i(σ1 +σ2\nU\n= e\nz\nz)φ = cos(φ)2\n\n+\n\n+ sin(φ)2σ1σ2\nz\nz -i sin(φ) cos(φ)(σ1 + σ2\nz\nz)\nand\n\nU\n= e -iσzσzφ = cos(φ)11 -i sin(φ)σ1σ2\n×\nz\nz\nFor these operators it was also easy to calculate the exponentials from the matrix form, since the matrices are diagonal in the\nusual z-basis (and the exponential of a diagonal matrix is obtained by just exponentiating its diagonal elements). However, I\nhope that you understand also the arguments above, that simply the calculations in many other cases (e.g. if I had replace σz\nwith σx).\nProblem 3 Probing the number of photons in a cavity with Rydberg atoms\n30 points\nIn the first lecture I presented a paper by Serge Haroche's group describing an experiment that follows the quantum life of a\nphoton. We now have most of the tools to fully understand this paper. This will be discussed in problems 3-5.\n[Note: you don't need to read the paper to solve the problems (you won't have the time!), just look at the Figures for reference.]\nFig. 1 describes the experimental apparatus, that consists of a first Ramsey cavity R1, a cavity C, a second Ramsey cavity R2\nand the detector D. The atoms can be in two possible states |g) or |e) (the ground and excited states).\nThe Box B prepares a flux of atoms in their ground state. We will consider the evolution of a single atom from that initial\nstate.\nThe Ramsey cavity R1 operates on the atoms with the Hamiltonian\nHR1 = iΩR(|e)(g| -|g)(e|)\na) What is the matrix representation of HR1 in the basis |e), |g)?\nb) The atoms take a time tR = π/(ΩR4) to traverse the Ramsey cavity (during which time they experience the Hamiltonian\nabove). What is the state of the atom at the exit of the Ramsey cavity?\nIn the cavity C, the atom interacts for a time tC with the electro-magnetic field, with an Hamiltonian\nHC = nω(|g)(g| -|e)(e|)\nwhere n is the number of photons in the cavity itself. Finally, the second Ramsey cavity R2 has an Hamiltonian that is similar\nto R1:\nHR2 = -iΩR(|e)(g| -|g)(e|)\nand it takes the same time tR = π/(ΩR4) for the atom to traverse this cavity.\nc) What is the probability of finding the atom in the state |g) at the detector D?\nSolution\na)\ni\nHR1 = ΩR\n\n-\n\n= ΩRσ\ni 0\ny\nRecognizing that this matrix is just the σy Pauli operator (and the other Hamiltonian as well could be expressed in terms of Pauli\noperators) and using the formula given above for the exponential of the Pauli operators should have simplified the calculations.\n\nb) With the formula provided U\ne-iσy π/\nR1 =\n4 = cos(π/4)11 -i sin(π/4)σy = √ 1 (11 -iσy). The atom before the cavity is\nin the ground state |g). Thus the atom after the cavity is in the state\nUR1|g) = √ (11 -iσy)\n|g) = √ (|g) + |e))\nc) Writing down the explicit matrix representation of HC one recognizes that the hamiltonian is just HC = nωσz. In\nparticular, if n = 0 the Hamiltonian is just 0.\nThen the evolution in the cavity is UC = e-inωσz giving a state\nUC √ (|g) + e\n| )) = √ (e -inωtC |g) + e inωtC |e))\nThe evolution in the second cavity is just U\n= eiσ π/4\nR1\ny\n= √ (11 + iσy) (as HR2 = -Ωσy). Finally we have:\n|ψ)\n=\n[e -inωtC\nin\n(|g) -|e)) + e inωtC\nf\n(|e) + |g))] = cos(nωtC|g) + i sin(nωtC)\n|e)\nThus the probability is p(g) = |(g|ψ i )|2\nf n\n= cos(nωtC)2 .\nNotice that if n = 0 p(g) = 1 always. This is also because the evolution is just given by the two Ramsey cavities (as the cavity\nHamiltonian is zero). But the two cavities are just one the opposite of the other, so that UR2UR1 = 11 so the initial state |g)\ndoes not evolve at all if there are 0 photons in the cavity.\nProblem 4 Probing photon number states with Rydberg atoms\n30/40 points\nNow consider the e.m. field in the cavity C as a quantum mechanical system. Under the experiment conditions, the field is such\nthat there's at most one photon in the cavity (that is, either 0 or 1 photons).\na) What is a basis for the Hilbert space H = HA ⊗He.m.? (where HA is the atom's and He.m. the photon's Hilbert spaces.\nWhat is the Hamiltonian HC for the interaction of the atom with the photon in the cavity? [This should replace the operator\nHC given above, for the cases n = {0, 1}]\nb) Assume that initially we do not know how many photons are in the cavity, but only that it is more probable to have zero\nphotons (with 75% of probability). What is the state of the atom-photon system at the instant in which the atom enters the\ncavity C? (use the result found in Problem 3.b for the state of the atom).\nc) The atom stays in the cavity for a time t = π/(2ω). We then detect the atom and find that it's in the state |e). What does\nthis tell us about the number of photons in the cavity?\n[Hint 1: e-i(σz |1)(1|)ωt = e-iσz ωt|1)(1| + 11|0)(0|. Hint 2: You might be able to give an answer even without doing any\ncalculations.]\nThis is the method used in the paper to indirectly measure the photon number (either 0 or 1) by looking at the state of the atom.\nEven if we do not know a priori the number of photons in the cavity, we can infer it from the measurement of the atom's state.\nIn the second experiment reported in the paper, the authors can initialize the photon number in a precise state. You should have\nfound that the sequence of operations (First Ramsey cavity, Cavity, Second Ramsey cavity) gives the total propagator:\nU = U\nU\niσxφ\nR2\nCUR1 = e -\n|1)(1| + 11|0)(0| →-iσx|1)(1| + 11|0)(0| (for φ = π/2)\nd) If the field is initially in a superposition state √ 1 (|0) + |1)) (and the atom still |g) before the first Ramsey cavity), is the\nfinal state entangled? What would be the correlation between measuring the atom in the excited (ground) state and measuring\none (zero) photons?\ne) What is the probability of observing the atom in the |g) state at the detector D?\nNow assume that the detector measures the atom's state, but the detector is unreliable, so that we do not know the outcome.\nWhat is the state of the photon after measuring the atom?\n\nSolution\na) We have a composite system of two two-level systems. The first system represents the atom, with basis {|g), |e)}. The\nsecond system is the e.m. field, that we represent with the photon number. Here we restricted the photon number to either\n0 or 1, so that the basis for the e.m. field is just {|0), |1)}. A basis for the composite system is then {|g0), |g1)|e0)|e1)}.\nNotation-wise, I set the first system to be the atom and the second to be the e.m. (or photon) system without further labeling\nthe operators. This should be consistent with later notation.\nThe hamiltonian should represent the same evolution as before (given by HC) when we restrict to the possibility of having only\n1 or 0 photons. Notice that for 0 photons HC = 0, while for 1 photon HC = ωσA\nz . Thus we can write the Hamiltonian for the\ncomposite system as\nH\n= ωσA\nC\nz ⊗|1)(1|e.m.\nb) The state of the photon is represented by the density operator: ρ\n= 3\ne.m.\n|0)(0| +\n|1)(1|. The state of the system is thus:\nρ =\n(|e\n) + |g))((e| + (g|) ⊗( |0)(0 +\n|\n|1)(1|)\nc) The propagator of the cavity is e-i(σz |1)(1|)ωt = e-iσz ωt|1)(1| + 11|0)(0| = (-iσz|1)(1| + 11|0)(0|) thus:\nUCρUC\n+ = (-iσz|1)(1|+11|0)(0|)ρ(+iσz|1)(1|+11|0)(0|) =\n(|e\n)+|g))((e|+(g|)⊗|0)(0|+\n(|e)-|g))((e|-(g|)\n⊗| )(1|\nAfter the second Ramsey cavity this becomes:\n|g)(g| ⊗|0)(0\n| +\n|e)(e| ⊗|1)(1\n|\nThus, if we detect the atom in the |e) state it must mean that we had a photon in the cavity. You could have argued this result\nfrom the Hamiltonian in 3.b or 4.a: if n = 0, HC = 0 so that it's not possible to find the atom in |e) since the two Ramsey\ncavity just cancel each other UR2UR1 = 11. Physically, it means that if there is a photon, this photon can give some energy to\nthe atom and induce an evolution to the excited state.\nd) We apply the given U to the initial state\nU|g) ⊗ √ (|0) + |1)) = (-iσx|1)(1| + 11|0)(0|)[√ (|g0) + |g1))] = √ ( g 0\ni e 1 )\n2 | )| ) -| )| )\nThus the state is a maximally entangled state. e.g. the concurrence is 1, since α = √ 1 and δ =\n√\n-i , so that C = 2\n|αδ-βγ| = 1.\nThere is a perfect correlation of finding 1 photon if the atom is found in the state |e):\n1 ((g|(0| + i(e|(1|)(σA σe.m.\nz\nz\n)(\n|g)|0) -i|e)|1)) = 1\ne) There is a 50% probability of finding the atom in the state |g): |(g| √ 1 (|g\n)|0) -i|e)|1))|2 = 1/2\nIf the result of the measurement is unknown, then with 50% probability we measured |g) and there is no photon, and with\n50% probability we measured |e) and the photon is in the state |1). Thus we have a mixed state for the photon equal to\nρ\ne.m. =\n(|0)(0| + |1)(1|) = 11/2 (maximally mixed state).\nProblem 5 Quantum jumps of light recording the birth and death of a photon\n10/20 points\nIn Fig. 3 of the paper, the authors show the decay of a one-photon state, as measured indirectly by the atom. Following their\nmodel [and guided by the results in (4.c) and (4.d)] we now consider the photon only and assume that we are directly observing\nits dynamics. Because of thermal fluctuations, the number of photons can jump from 1 to zero: at each instant of time, if there\nis a photon, it can be absorbed with probability p (or not, with probability 1 - p). If there are already no photons, nothing\nhappens.\n\na) Write Kraus operators describing this process.\n[Hint: you could consider the interaction of the photon e.m. field -the system S- with a bath -the environment E- giving the\nevolution:\nUSE|0)S|0)E →|0)s|0)\n√\nE\nUSE\n√\n|1)S|0)E →\np|0)S|1)E +\n1 -p|1)S|2)E\nThe same result can also be obtained by considering the different processes the photon can undergo].\nb) What is the state ρ ′ after one step, if the initial state of the atom is |1)? What is (1|ρ|1) after n steps?\nc) Assume nothing happens to the photon (initially in the state |1)) until time t0 where a jumps to the |0) state happens. Plot\na figure similar to Fig. 3a.\nd) Now we look instead at the average evolution of the photon, as described by the evolution of the density operator under\nthe action of the superoperator ρ(t) = S(t)[ρ]. Take p = γδt, with δt = t/n, in the limit of n →inf (and fixed t). What is the\ntime evolution of the density operator? How does this compare with Fig. 3d?\nSolution\na) There are 3 Kraus operators:\nM0 =\n= √\n|0)(0| M1\np|0)(1|\nM2 =\np\n1 -p|1)(1|\nThe first operator describes the fact that if there is no photon nothing happens and the photon number stays = 0. The other two\noperators describe the processes in which with probability p one photon is absorbed (i.e. we go from 1 to 0 photons) and with\nprobability 1 -p we still have 1 photon.\nThe Kraus operators can be found also from Mk = E (k|USE|0)E, where the projection is taken on the environment state only.\nHere we have M0 =\n√\n√\n(0|USE|0)E = |0)(0|S; M1 = (1|USE|0)E =\np|0)(1|S; and M2 = (2|U)SE|0)E =\n1 -p|1)(1|.\nb) The state after applying the Kraus operators is\nρ ′ =\nL\nMk|1)(1|Mk\n+ = p|0)(0| + (1 -p)\nk\n|1)(1|\nAt each step the matrix element ρ11 = (1|ρ|1) is multiplied by a factor (1 -p). The simplest way to calculate ρ00 = (0|ρ|0) is\njust knowing that Tr{ρ} = 1 so that ρ00 = 1 -ρ11. We thus have: ρ(n) = [1 -(1 -p)n]|0)(0| + (1 -p)n|1)(1|\nc) The plot is exactly as in Fig.3a\nd) With the approximation (1 -γt/n)n → e-γt for n →inf, and using the formula for ρ(n) (after n steps) as above, the\nevolution of ρ\nγt\nγt\n11 is ρ11(t) = e-\nρ11(0) = e-\n. So the plot would be the same as as in Fig. 3d (an exponential decay).\n1.0\n1.0\n5.c\n0.8\n\n5.d\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.6\n0.4\n0.4\n0.2\n0.2\nt0\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\n22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Calculate the evolution of the expectation value of\nthe electric field E =\n2π1ω\n3 (a + a+) in the following cases:\nL\na) The state of the e.m\nV\n. field is a superposition of two coherent states:\nψ(0) = [cos(θ)|α) + sin(θ)e iφ|β)]/N\nwhere N is a coefficient to normalize the state.\nSolution:\nIn the Heisenberg picture we can calculate the evolution of the creation and annihilation operators:\n\na(t) = a(0)eiωt.\nThus we obtain:\n2π~ω\n(\n\nE(t)) =\n\n(\nae iωt + a + e -iωt\nL3\n)\n(\n)\n\n2π~ω [\niωt\n\nE(t) =\ncos(θ) Re[αe\n] + sin(θ)2Re[βeiωt] + sin(2θ)Re e iφ α(β|α)e iωt + β ∗α\nL\n( |β)e -iωt\nwhere (α|β) = e-(|α|2+|β|2)/2+α∗β .\n{\n(\n)}]\nb) The state of the e.m. field is a mixture of the two coherent states above:\nρ(0) = cos 2(θ)|α)(α| + sin2(θ)|β)(β|\nSolution:\nStill in the Heisenberg picture we can calculate the expectation value as:\n(E) = Tr {ρ(0)E(t)} =\n\n2π~ω Tr\n{\n\nρ(0)(ae iωt + a + e -iωt)\nL3\nWe note that Tr\n}\n{a|α)(α|} = (α|a|α) = α and find:\n2π~ω\n(E)\n\n= Tr {ρ(0)E(t)} =\n\n[\ncos(θ)2 (\nαeiωt + α∗ e -iωt)\n+ sin(θ)2 (\nβeiωt + β ∗ e -iωt\nL3\n)]\n\n2π~ω\n=\n[\ncos(θ)2Re[αeiωt] + sin(θ)2Re[βeiωt]\nL3\n]\nc) What is the average photon number in the two cases?\nSolution:\nWe want to calculate a+a in the two cases.\n(\n)\n\nIn the first case, we find:\n(n) = cos(θ)2|α|2 + sin(θ)2|β|2 + sin(2θ)Re\n{\ne iφαβ ∗ (β|α)\nwhile in the second case, the last term is zero:\n}\n(n) = cos(θ)2|α|2 + sin(θ)2|β|2\nd) Assuming for simplicity that α, β ∈ R (are real), in what limit the two results found in a) and b) (and the two\nresults in c) become equivalent?\nSolution:\nIf the coherent states where orthogonal, the coherent superposition and incoherent mixture would have given the same\nexpectation values. Their overlap is ( | )\n-(|α|2+|β|2\nα\n)\n\nβ = e\n/2+α∗β. For α, β ∈ R we have\nβ2\nα β = e-(α +\n-2αβ)/2 =\ne-\n\n(α\n( | )\n-β)2 which goes to zero if |α -β| ≫1.\nProblem 2: Atom observed via a quantum meter\n35 points\nConsider the experiment performed by Brune et al. (PRL 77(24) 4887, 1996). A Rydberg atom is prepared in an equal\nsuperposition of two states (its ground |g) and excited state |e)), which are separated by an energy ~ω.\nThis state is achieved e.g., by applying the operator: U\n=\nH\n√\n(\nto the atom's ground state.\n1 -1\nThe atom interacts with an e.m. field, which is initially in a coherent stat\n)\ne |α) with average photon number (n) = α2\n(with α real). The e.m. field is inside a cavity and thus restricted to a single mode of frequency ν. The interaction can\ndrive a transition between the two atom levels at a rate λ, exciting the atom from the ground to the excited state, while\nannihilating a photon; and creating a photon, while lowering the atom from the excited to the ground state.\na) Write the Hamiltonian describing these two systems (H0) and their interaction (V ).\nSolution:\nσz\nH = ~ω\n+ ~ν(a+ a +\n) + ~λ(aσ+ + a +σ-)\nor\nH = ~ω|e)(e| + ~ν(a+a +\n) + ~λ(a|e)(g| + a +|g)(e|)\nb) We now take the limit where λ ≪ ω, ν. Thus the interaction can be considered as a perturbation. Further, we\nhave λ ≪ Δ = ω -ν, i.e. the system is off-resonance. Then we can simplify the Hamiltonian as:\nH ≈ H = H0 +\n(δEg,n|g, n)(g, n| + δEe,n\nn\n|e, n\n\n)(e, n|)\nwhere δEg/e,n are the energy shifts due to the interaction, to the first non-zero order in time-independent perturbation\ntheory. Write an explicit expression for H .\nSolution:\nThe zeroth order correction is zero, so we need to calculate the second order correction, which gives\n|(g, n|V |e, n -1)|2\nλ2n\nλ2\n~\n~\nδE(2)\nn\ng,n =\n=\nE\n~\ng,n\nν(n +\n)\nEg,n -Ee,n\n-\n→\n≈\n-\n-1\nΔ\nΔ\nand\nδE(2)\ne,n = |(e, n|V |g, n + 1)|2\nλ2\n~\n(n + 1)\n~λ2(n + 1)\n=\nE\n~\n-\ne,n\nω + ~ν(n +\n) +\nEe,n\nEg,n+1\nΔ\n→\n≈\nΔ\nc) What is the evolution of the initial state described above? Use the Hamiltonian found above to prove that the\nevolved state (in the interaction picture defined by H0) is given by √ 1 (|g, αe-iφ(t)) + eiφ(t)|e, αeiφ(t)).\n\nSolution:\nWe write the initial state, |ψ(0)) = √ 1 (|e) + |g))|α) in terms of the Hamiltonian eigenstates:\ne-|α|2/2\nαn\n|ψ) =\n√\n( e, n +\n\n√\nn!\nn\n|\n)\n|g, n))\nThe evolved state is then:\ne-|α|2/2\n√\n2 αn\n|\n)\n√\n\nψ(t) =\ne -i(n+1)λ t/Δ e, n + e inλ t/Δ g, n\nn\nn!\n|\n)\n|\n)\n\ne-|α|2/2\n(αe-iλ2\nt/Δ)n\n(αeiλ2t/Δ)n\n|ψ(t)) =\n√\ne -iλ t/Δ e, n +\ng, n )\nn!\nn!\nn\n√\n|\n)\n√\n|\n)\n|\n\nψ(t)) = √ (|g, αeiλ2 t/Δ\n) + e -iλ2t/Δ|e, αe-iλ2t/Δ))\nd) The atom leaves the cavity after a time T , and it is then rotated back by the propagator UH . What is the probability\nPe(T ) of finding the atom in the excited state?\nWhat does this probability becomes in the limit (n) →inf? What about the limit (n) →0?\nSolution:\nWe set β\n\n=\neiλ2\nα\nT/Δ. The state becomes:\n|ψ(T )) =\n[\n|g, β) +\n|e, β) + e iφ|g, β ∗) -e iφ|e, β ∗)\n]\n|ψ(T )) =\ng\ne\n2 | ) |β) + e iφ|β ∗ ) + | ) |β) -e iφ|β ∗ )\nThe probability of being in the excited state\n[\nis\n(\n)\n(\n)]\nPe(T ) =\nTr\n{(\n|β) -e iφ|β ∗)\n) (\n(β ∗| -e -iφ(β|\n)}\n=\n((β|β)+(β ∗|β ∗)-e -iφ(β|β ∗)-e iφ(β ∗|β)) =\n(1-Re[e iφ(β ∗|β)])\nFrom the value of (\nα2\nβ∗|β) = e-\n(1-e- 2iφ ) we have\n-\n\nR\ni\n2)2\ne[e φ(β∗|β)] = e\nα2 sin(φ/\n/2 cos(φ + α2 sin φ).\nIn the limit (n) = α2 → 0 the probability is\nλ2T\nPe =\n(1 -cos φ) = sin2\n(\n2Δ\n)\nthus the atom oscillates between its ground and excited state as if performing Rabi oscillations with Rabi frequency\nΩ = λ2/Δ.\nIn the opposite limit (n) = α2 →inf the exponential term goes to zero provided that α2 sin(φ/2)2 ≫ 1. When the\ndistance between the two states of the cavity e.m. field becomes large enough we have P\n= 1\ne = Pg\n: the reduced\nstate of the atom (neglecting the e.m. field) decays to an incoherent (classical) mixture of the two levels.\nProblem 3: Transition Rate\n15 points\nConsider the same system as in the previous problem: a two-level atom (with energy separation ~ω) interacting with\na single mode e.m. field of energy ~ν by an interaction of strength ~λ. Now we consider the case where the atom is\ninitially in the ground state, while the field is still in a coherent state with α = √ n. At time t = 0 we turn on the\ninteraction between the atom and the field.\na) To first order approximation, what is the transition rate to a state |e, β), with β = αeiψ ?\nSolution:\nSince the interaction is time-independent, we can use Fermi's Golden rule. The transition rate is given by:\n2π\nW = ~ |Vif |2δ(ωfi)\nħ\n\nFor the system at hand, since the initial and final states of the field are not eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, we have\nto find the correct ωfi from the perturbation V in the interaction picture. We find V =\nλ(aσ+e-iΔt +\ni\n~\na+σ-e Δt),\nthus ωfi = ω -ν = Δ, since the transition from ground to excited state will involve also the exchange of a photon of\nenergy ν. The matrix element is given by:\nV\n= (e, β| λ(aσ+\n~\n+ a +σ-)|g, α) = (β|α)~\nif\nλα\nWith β\n\n= αeiψ we have |(β|α)|2 = e-4α2 sin(ψ/2)2. Thus the rate is:\nW\n= 2π~λ2 (n) e-4(n) sin(ψ/2) δ(Δ)\nb) Compare this result to what you found in problem 2. What would be the transition rate in problem 3.a if Δ ≫ λ?\nWhat would have been the probability Pe(t) of the atom being in the excited state (problem 2.d) if the initial state were\n|g, α) as in problem 3?\nSolution:\nIf Δ ≫ λ or more generally Δ ≈ 0 the transition rate becomes zero. This is consistent with what found in the previous\nproblem. There, we saw that for Δ ≫ λ the perturbation only acts as a phase shift for the atom. Thus if the initial\nstate is |g, α) the probability of a transition to the excited state would be zero.\nProblem 4: Resonant Scattering\n30 points\nConsider light scattering from an atom. The system of interest is described by an atom (with eigenstates |mk) and\nenergies Ek) and the e.m. radiation field.\nFor convenience the system is enclosed in a cavity of volume V = L3. The interaction between the radiation field and\nthe atom is described by the hamiltonian V\nE E\n= -d · E in the dipole approximation, where\n2π~ω\nE\nh\n~\nE\n\n~\nahξeih·R\n=\n\n+ a h\n+\nξe -~h· ~\ni\nR Eo\n\nhξ\nV\nh,ξ\nwith R the position of the center of mass of the atom.\nYou can use the following steps to calculate the scattering cross section\n\nW\ndσ =\nfi , with W\n2π\nfi =\n1 |(f|T\nΦ\n\n|i)|2ρ(Ef ),\n\nwhere T is the transition matrix and ρ(Ef ) the final density of states.\ninc\na) What is the flux of incoming photons and the density of states of the outgoing photons?\nSolution:\nΦ\n= c/L3\ninc\nand\n(\n)3\nL\nω2\nk\nρ(Ef ) =\ndΩ\n2π\n~c3\nb) What are the possible intermediate (virtual) states that we need to consider in this scattering process?\nSolution:\nThe initial state is |mi, 1k,lλ, 0k′ ,λ′ ) and final state |mi, 0k,lλ, 1k′ ,λ′ ).

      "content": "22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nFinal Exam\nDecember 19, 2011\nSolution\nProblem 1: Rutherford Scattering\n35 points\n100 years ago, in 1911, Rutherford explained the observed surprising behavior of alpha particles scattering from a gold\nfoil, leading to the discovery of the nucleus. In this problem we want to derive from quantum-mechanics scattering\ntheory the expression for Rutherford cross-section for electrons.\nThe system is described by an electron and a nucleus, for convenience enclosed in a cavity of volume V = L3. The\ninteraction between the electron and the nucleus is the Coulomb interaction between the electron and the Z protons in\nthe nucleus.\nYou can use the following steps to calculate the scattering cross section dσ\nW\n=\nfi , with W\n2π\nfi =\nn | (f| T |i) |2ρ(E )\n\nf ,\nΦ\nwhere T is the transition matrix and ρ(Ef) the final density of states.\ninc\na) Assume the electron energy is very large, so that ve ≈ c and pc ≫ mec2. What is the flux of incoming electrons\nand the density of states of the outgoing electrons?\nSolution:\nΦinc = ve/L3 ≈ c/L3\nand setting E ′ =\nV\np\n′ 2c2 + m2ec4 ≈ p′ c, we have\n\nL\nd p ′\nL\nE\n′ 2\nρ(E ′ ) =\n\np′2\ndΩ =\ndΩ\n2πl\n\nd E′\n\n2πl\n\nc3\nb) The interaction Hamiltonian is given by V = eφ(qr), where φ is the scalar potential given by the charge distribution\nZeρe(qr) of the nucleus via the equation ∇2φ(qr) = -Zeρe(qr)/o0. The initial and final state of the electron can be\ndescribed by a plane wave, normalized to the cavity volume.\nWhat is the transition matrix element | (f| T |i) |2 to lowest order?\n[Note: here you can assume that the nucleus does not change its state, so we can neglect it altogether in the calculation\nand consider its effects indirectly, through the potential V acting only on the electron]\nSolution:\nThe electron initial state is |\n\np) = eipp·pr/n\n√\n3 and its final state |p\n′\n′)\nip p ·r/n\n= e\np\n√\n3 .

How does this relate to the discovery\nof the nucleus?\nSolution:\nFrom the properties of the exponential, we have ∇q\nirq·rr/n\niqr·rr/n and ∇2 iqr·rr/n\ne\n= iqq/le\ne\n= -|qq|2/ 2 irq·rr/\nl e\nn.\n\nInserting this in the integral\nJ\neirq·rr/nφ(qr)d3r, we have\nV\ne 2\nl\nel\n(\n)\n\nf| T |i = -\nφ(qr)\n2 e irq·rr/n =\ne irq·rr/n\n2φ(qr)\nL3\nZ\n∇\n3 qq\nZ\n|qq|2\nL | |2\nV\nV\n∇\nUsing then the definition of the potential, we have\nZe2\n2 Z\nZe 2\nl\nl\n(f| T |i) = -\ne irq·rr/nρ\n| |\ne(qr) = -\nF (qq)\no0L3 qq 2\no0L3|qq|2\nV\nThus we found that the transition matrix is proportional to the Fourier Transform of the charge distribution. F (qq) is\ncalled the form factor of the charge distribution.\nPerforming a scattering experiment varying qq (varying the electron energy and as we will see below, the scattering\nangle) one can thus recover the nuclear charge distribution. This means that one can map the shape of the nucleus. In\nparticular, the observed angular dependence of the cross-section indicates that the atom presents a point-like target to\nthe electrons, thus supporting the idea of a small nucleus inside the atomic electron cloud.\ne) Assume a point distribution for the charge density, ρe(qr) = δ(qr). What is the scattering cross-section?\nSolution:\nFor a point distribution,\nF (qq) =\nZ\ne iqr·rr/nρe(qr) =\nZ\neirq·rr/nδ(qr) = 1\nV\nV\nBringing together the various terms calculated, we have\nd σ\n2π\n2 4\n′2\n′ 2\nl\n= Φ-1\n| (f| T |i) |2\nL 2π Z e\nL\nE\ne Z E\ninc\nρ(Ef) =\n\n=\nd Ω\nl\nc l o2 L6\n|qq|4\n2πl\nc3\n4π2o2|qq|4\nc4\nor, using the fine structure constant, α\n\n=\ne2\n,\n4πo0nc\nd σ\n4α2Z2\nl E\n′ 2\n=\nd Ω\n|qq|4c2\nf) Since we neglected the nucleus recoil, the scattering is elastic, and the only change is the electron momentum\ndirection, which is deflected at an angle θ with respect to the initial direction. Use this consideration to find the\nfamous angular dependence of Rutherford scattering.\nSolution:\nFor elastic scattering, |pq| = |pq ′ | and we assumed pq · pq ′ = p2 cos θ. Then, |qq| = 2p sin\n( θ)\n= 2E ′ /c sin\n( θ)\n.

What were the criteria for the classifica\ntion? What are examples of different types of scattering?\nSolution:\nEnergy of the incoming radiation wrt ionization energy. Elastic or inelastic scattering.\nb) In class we saw two different types of Hamiltonians describing the interaction of the e.m. field with matter, the\ndipole interaction, -q\nq\nd · E and the vector potential -\n\ne\nq\npq · A +\ne\nA2. When is it more appropriate to use one\nmc\n2mc\ninteraction or the other? Which interaction should we generally use to describe scattering and why?\nSolution:\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\nThe two Hamiltonians arise from quantizations of the e.m. fields in different gauges, in particular the dipole Hamil\ntonian is derived in the Lorentz gauge, which assumes no sources. Thus, the dipole Hamiltonian can be used for\noptical wavelength, which are much larger than the atom's dimension (so that the approximation of having no sources\nis justified).\nFor scattering, we should generally use the vector potential Hamiltonian, since it allows two-photon transitions even\nto first order approximation, although for optical light scattering, the dipole Hamiltonian does give the same result.\nc) What state best describes a classical e.m. field? Why?\nSolution:\nA coherent state, since the expectation value of the electric and magnetic fields have the same time evolution as the\nclassical fields.\nd)\nWhat differential equation describes the evolution of an open quantum system (a system interacting with the\nenvironment)? Is this equation always valid?\nSolution:\nThe Lindblad master equation, which is valid only for a Markovian environment (i.e. a memory-less environment).\ne) What type of information can you gather from a scattering experiment of X-rays or neutrons from a crystal? What\nextra information can a neutron scattering experiment provide you?\nSolution:\nFrom scattering experiment we can derive the structure factor, which gives information on the crystal planes via\nBragg's Law (thus we get information on crystal structure). Neutron scattering also depends on spins, hence we\ncan get isotope information and magnetic structure (the main difference between the two scatterings is that neutrons\ninteract with nuclei, while x-rays with electrons).\nProblem 3: Radiation Pressure on a Cantilever\n30 points\nConsider a cantilever of frequency ωc and mass mc. A beam of (single-mode) light of frequency ν is directed per\npendicular to the surface of the cantilever. Radiation pressure can be represented by an interaction Hamiltonian\n+\nV = lg(a a)ˆx, where a, a+ represent the light (e.m. field) operators, and xˆ is the quantum mechanical position\noperator of the cantilever (a quantum harmonic oscillator).\na) What is the total Hamiltonian H = H0 + V representing the e.m. field, the cantilever and their interaction? What\nare the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the uncoupled Hamiltonian H0?\nSolution:\nThe Hamiltonian is represented by two harmonic oscillators, one for the field and one for the cantilever, coupled by\nV :\n\nl\n+\n+\nH = H0 + V = lν(a a +\n) + lωc(b+b +\n) + lga a\n(b+ + b)\n2mcωc\nwhere I defined b, b+ the cantilever operators.\nThe eigenstates of the uncoupled system are simply the number states of both oscillators, |nγ, nc), where I called nγ\nthe photon number, and the corresponding eigenvalues are Enγ,nc = lν(nγ +\n) + lωc(nc +\n).\nb) Consider now the radiation pressure as a perturbation coupling the two systems. What is the energy shift Δnγ,nc\nto the lowest non-zero order?\nSolution:\nWe can use time-independent perturbation theory to calculate the energy shift. Since xˆ does not have diagonal terms\nin the number-state basis, the first order is zero.

In other words: is it more\nprobable that the laser is cooling down or heating up the cantilever?\nWhat is the most probable final state for the e.m. field?\nSolution:\nThe transition rate to the state |nc + 1) is calculated in the same way as above, except we need to take the matrix\nelement, (nc + 1| b |nc) = √ nc + 1.

      "content": "22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nMid-Term Exam\nNovember 2, 2011\nSolution\nFor most of this midterm exam we are interested in describing the quantum behavior of a particle -such as an atom or\na ion- which is confined in a double well potential. The particle can be in either the left or right well. It has energy\nER = E0 - ΔE in the right well and energy EL = E0 + ΔE in the left well. The barrier between the two wells\nis not very high, so the particle can tunnel between the two wells at a rate Γ. We neglect all degrees of freedom and\ncharacteristics of the particle, except for its position (either left or right). You can set for simplicity E0 = 0 and I = 1.\n2ΔE\nΓ\nL\nR\nΓ\nL\nR\nI\nFigure 1: Left: Double well system. Right: Double well with ΔE = 0 and photons going through the left well.\nProblem 1: Particle in a double well\n15 points\na) What is the Hamiltonian describing the tunneling, HT ? What is the total Hamiltonian - describing the tunneling\nand the energy of the particle in the two wells?\nSolution:\nThe Hamiltonian describing the various energy/interaction terms should be hermitian operators that act on the basis\nstates |L) , |R) as desired:\nHT = Γ(|R) (L| + |L) (R|)\nH = ER |R) (R| + EL |L) (L| + HT\nor\nHT = Γσx,\nH = E011 + ΔEσz + Γσx\nb) The particle is at thermal equilibrium. At high temperature T , what is the particle state, to first order in 1/T ?\nSolution:\nSince the state is at thermal equilibrium, it means we are considering a canonical ensemble. Then the state is in a\nmixed state given by\ne-βH\nβ\nρ =\n≈\n+\nH,\nZ\nwhere β = 1/(k\nβ\nbT ). Note that 1/Z = 1/Tr\n{\ne-H}\n≈ 1/N to first order, where N is the dimension of the system.\nExplicitly we have:\nρ =\n+\n(ΔEσz + Γσx)\nc) At zero temperature, T = 0, what is the probability of finding the particle in the right well? What conditions on\nΔE and Γ should be satisfied for this probability to be Peq,T =0(R) ≈ 1?\nSolution:\n\nAt zero temperature, the system will be in the ground state of the Hamiltonian. Thus we need to diagonalize H =\nΓσx + ΔEσz. With the formula given in class, the ground state is\nΔ\n\n-\nq\n√\n-\nΔE2 + Γ2\n|ψ)\n= √\nE\n-\n\nq\n1 +\nΔE\n\n√\nΔE2+Γ2\n\nwith energy\n√\n-\nΔE2 + Γ2. Thus, the probability of being in the right well is Peq,T =0(R) = 1(1 +\nΔE\n).\n√\nΔE2+Γ2\nIn order for this to be almost one, we need ΔE ≪ Γ and ΔE > 0 (if ΔE < 0 the state is in the left well at zero\ntemperature and for ΔE ≪ Γ).\nProblem 2: Evolution\n15 points\na) The particle is prepared in the right well at time t = 0. At time t = 0+ the energy difference of the two wells is\nremoved (ΔE = 0) and the particle is left to evolve. What is the particle state? What is the probability of finding the\nparticle in the left well at a time t?\nSolution:\nThe evolution is |ψ(t)) = U(t) |ψ(0)). The propagator is simply U = e-iΓσxt and with the usual formula U =\ncos(Γt)11 -i sin(Γt)σx we find |ψ(t)) = cos(Γt) |R) -i sin(Γt) |L). Thus the probability is PL(t) = sin(Γt)2 .\nb) Now assume that the energy difference between the two wells is periodically varied in time, ΔE(t) = ΔE cos(ωt),\nwith ω ≫ ΔE. What is the equation of motion for the particle in an appropriate \"picture\"?\nSolution:\nWe can make a transformation to the interaction picture given by the Hamiltonian H0 = ωσx. Note that it is possible\nto define an infinite number of \"interaction pictures\", the one which is more appropriate depends on what we want\nto describe or on what would give the simplest (mathematical) expression. Here one goal could be to find a time-\nindependent Hamiltonian, since we know that solving for time-dependent ones is very difficult. Hence, it is more\nappropriate to choose H0 = ωσx than e.g. H0 = Γσx,which would not remove the time dependency, although this\nlast one is still a correct interaction picture transformation. In the interaction picture defined by H0 = ωσx, we have:\nHI = (Γ -ω)σx + ΔE/2σz + ΔE/2[σz cos(2ωt) -iσx sin(ωt)]\nThe evolution in the interaction picture is simply given by the usual Schr odinger equation:\nd |ψI) = i\nd t\nHI |ψI)\nc) Extra credits: Using a well-known approximation, solve for the evolution of the particle (either for ω = Γ or in\nthe general case).\nSolution:\nWe can simplify the Hamiltonian above by neglecting the time-dependent part (rotating wave approximation):\nHI = (Γ -ω)σx + ΔE/2σz\nfor ω = Γ this is further simplified to HI = ΔE/2σz. Thus we have,\n|ψ (t)) = e -iΔEσz/2t\nI\n|ψI(0))\nIf |ψI(0)) = |ψ(0)) = |R) then the system evolves as if ΔE = 0.\nOff resonance, we need to first diagonalize the Hamiltonian to find the evolution. We would then retrieve Rabi's\nformula:\n\nΩt\nΔE\nΩt\nΓ\nΩt\n|ψI(t)) =\ncos\n+ i\nsin\nR\ni\nsin\nL\nΩ\n\n| ) -Ω\n\n| )\nwith Ω =\n√\nΔE2 + Γ2 (see also section 5.4 of lecture notes).\n\nProblem 3: Measurement\n20 points\nTo measure if the particle is in the left well, we send in a photon. The photon, initially in the ground state |0), interacts\nwith the particle (only if the particle is in the left well) and is promoted to the state |1).\n(If the photon had been in the state |1) the scattering would have demoted it to the state |0)).\na) What is the unitary operator U describing the combined transformation of the particle and photon? Is measuring\nthe state of the photon after this interaction a good way of measuring the particle's position?\nSolution:\nThe unitary operator is the CNOT operation that we saw in class:\nU = |R) (R| ⊗11 + |L) (L| ⊗σx\nIf we assume to be able to prepare the photon in the ground state |0), then the photon is mapped to |1) only if the\nparticle is in the left well. So measuring the state of the photon is a good way of measuring the particle position. As\nwe see in question (b) the two systems become entangled after this interaction and there is a perfect (anti)correlation\nbetween their states.\nNote that other similar operators could be found, but it is at least needed to check that they are indeed unitary. For\nexample V = |L) (L| ⊗σx is not unitary, since V + = V but V +V = |L) (L| ⊗11 = 11 ⊗11.\nA possible interaction that gives rise to this operator is: Hint = |L) (L| ⊗σx. Then we have:\ninf\ninf\nU ′ (t) = e -iHintt =\n\n(-it |L) (L| ⊗σx)n/n! = 11\n11 + L\nL\n( itσx)n/n!\nn=0\n⊗\n| ) ( | ⊗\nn\n\n=1\n-\ninf\n= |R) (R| ⊗11 + |L) (L| ⊗\n\n(-itσ\nn\nx) /n! = R\nR\n11 + L\nL\ne -iσxt\nn=0\n| ) ( | ⊗\n| ) ( | ⊗\nsetting t = π/2 we obtain\nU ′ = |R) (R| ⊗11 -i |L) (L| ⊗σx\n(which is indeed unitary and acts as desired).\nb) The particle evolves for a time t⋆ = π/(4Γ) as in Problem 2:a. If the photon (initially in the ground state |0))\ninteracts with the particle at the time t ⋆, is the combined state of the photon and particle entangled? (assume the\nphoton-particle interaction of question (a) happens instantaneously at the time t ⋆).\nSolution:\nThe state of the particle at time t ⋆ is |ψ)\n⋆\n= e-iΓσxt |L) = (cos(π/4)11 - i sin(π/4)σx) |L) =\n√ (|L) -i |R)).\nConsidering the photon as well, we have:\n⋆\n|ψ(t ) = √ (|L) -i |R))\n|0) = √ (|L0) -i |R0\n))\nThen, applying the unitary found above we have\nU |ψ(t ⋆ ) = √ ( L1\ni R0 )\n2 |\n) -|\n)\nwhich is locally equivalent to a Bell state and thus it is entangled.\nc) Now assume that the photon detector we used in (a-b) is faulty: it absorbs the photon but does not record the state\nof the photon. What is the reduced state of the particle after the measurement? (here again, assume that the particle\nhad evolved for a time t ⋆ before the interaction with the photon).\nSolution:\nThe reduced state is just the identity, ρ = 1 (|R) (R|+|L) (L|) =\n, since with probability 1 the photon was measured\nin the |0) state (and the particle is projected to the |R) state) and with probability 1 the photon was measured in the\n|1) state (and the particle is projected to the |L) state).\n\nProblem 4: Dephasing\n20 points\nAs our photon detector is faulty, we decide not to measure the particle. Unfortunately, we cannot completely block the\nphotons from entering the left well: there is still a flux of photons with intensity I. Each photon, initially in the ground\nstate |0) interacts with the particle (only if the particle is in the left well) and with a probability p = Iδt is scattered\nby the particle and is promoted to the state |1). As we cannot measure the state of the photons, we are interested in the\nevolution of the particle only.\na) Describe the particle's evolution (due to the interaction with the photon only, neglect the particle Hamiltonian) in\nterms of a Kraus operator sum.\nSolution:\nWe have the possible evolutions:\n|R) |0) →|R) |0)\nand\n|L\n+ √\n) |0) →\n1 -p |L) |0)\np |L) |1)\nThus the two Kraus operators are:\np\nM0 = (0|U|0 =\np\n1 -p\n√\n)\n|L) (L| + |R) (R| ,\nM1 = (1|U|0)\np |L) (L|\nThe evolution is the Kraus sum:\nρ1 = M0ρ0M0\n+ + M1ρ0M1\n+\nwe can also check that these are good Kraus operators, since\n\nM +\nkMk = M0\n+M0 + M1\n+M1 = 11\nρ\nρ\nb) If the initial state of the particle is given by ρ0 =\n\nLL\nLR\n\n, what is the particle's state ρn after the interaction\nρRL ρRR\nwith n photons? (Assume that photons interact one at a time).\nSolution:\nApplying the Kraus sum once, we have:\n(1 -p)ρLL\n√\n\n1 -pρLR\n\npρLL 0\nρ\n+\nL\nρ\n√ 1\np\nρ1 =\n√\n=\nL\nLR\n-\n1 -pρRL\nρRR\n\nρRL\n√ 1\nρRR\n\n-p\nRepeating the same reasoning n times we obtain:\n\nρLL\nρLR(1 -p)n/2\nρn =\nρRL(1\n\n-p)n/2\nρRR\nc) In the limit δt → 0, write ρn as a function of the time t = nδt (remember p = Iδt).\nSolution:\nUsing the limit\nt/δt\nlim\nat\nδt\n0 (1 + aδt)\n= e\nwe have\n→\n\nρ\nρ\ne-It/2\nρ(t) =\nLL\nLR\nρ\n-It/2\nRLe\nρRR\n\nd) Assume ρ is given by the state of the particle at the time t ⋆\n(see Problem 3:b). What is the state of the particle for\nt →inf? How does it compare to what you found in Problem 3:c? Comment.\nSolution:\nWe can write the state |ψ(t ⋆)) as\n⋆\nρ(t ) = 2\n1 -i\ni 1\n\nand for t →inf this becomes the maximally mixed state, ρ\n= 111, as the information about the phase coherence is\ninf\nlost.\n\nProblem 5: Irreversible Evolution\n20 points\na) In the previous problem you found the evolution for the particle, ρ(t). Is it possible to find a differential equation\ndescribing this evolution? Explain why.\nSolution:\nThe system environment is Markovian, since the photon is lost and any information about its state is lost as well. Thus\nwe expect that a Master equation in the Lindblad form well describes the system evolution.\nWe can check that indeed taking the derivative of ρ(t) we find a first order differential equation:\nd ρ(t)\nI\nI\n= -\n\nρ\nt/2\nLRe-\nd t\nρRLe-It/2\n\nb) A differential equation for the particle's evolution is given by the Lindblad equation, with Lindblad jump operator\nL =\n√\nI/2σz. Is this consistent with the result you found in the previous problem? (You could for example check by\ntaking the derivative of ρ(t)).\nSolution:\nThe Lindblad equation is\nd ρ(t)\nI\n= Lρ(t)L+ -\n(L+Lρ(t) + ρ(t)L+L) =\nt\nd t\n-\n[ρ( )\n-σzρ(t)σz]\nwhich indeed gives the differential equation written above.\nc) Consider now the full evolution of the system, with the Lindblad operator found above and the tunneling Hamil\ntonian of Problem 1:a (i.e. set ΔE = 0). What is the differential equation describing the evolution? What is the\n(long-time) steady-state solution to this equation?\nSolution:\nThe differential equation now contains the Hamiltonian term (given by the usual Liouville equation) in addition to the\nLindblad operator above:\nd ρ(t)\n= -i[H, ρ(t)] +\n\nLkρ(t)L+ -\n(L+\nk\nkLkρ(t) + ρ(t)L+\nd t\nkLk)\nk\n\nand explicitly:\nd ρ(t)\n\nρ\n-ρ\nρ\n-ρ\nI\nρ\ne-It/2\n= -iΓ\nLR\nRL\nRR\nLL\nLR\nd t\nρRL -ρ\nIt/2\nLR ρLL\nρ\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\nRR\nρRLe\nThe steady state condition corresponds to setting d ρ(t) = 0. Solving the equation, this imposes ρRL = ρLR = 0 and\nd t\nρ\n= 1\nRR = ρLL\n(using the fact that Tr {ρ} = 1. Then the steady state is just ρSS =\n.\nProblem 6: Short questions\n10 points\n1 1\na) Is the state 1\n\npure? Describe two possible physical situation from where this state could have arisen.\n1 3\nSolution:\nThe purity of the state is Tr\n{\nρ2}\n= 3 < 1, thus the state is mixed. Indeed, we can write it as 111 + 1(σx\n. Then\n-σz)\nwe can verify that the Bloch vector is nn = 1[1, 0, -1] and |nn| =\n√ < 1.\nWe can think of this state as being the thermal state you found in Problem 1:b, for Γ = ΔE.\nOr if we write it as ρ = 1(11 + σ ) + 1\nx\n(11 - σz) we could think it as a state prepared with 50% probability in the\npositive x direction and with 50% probability in the negative z direction.\nAnother alternative is to consider this state as arising from an interaction with the environment.\nb) Consider two density operators, ρ1 and ρ2 describing e.g. an n-level system. What are the general conditions for\nthere to be a unitary operations that connects them? If ρ1 represents a pure state, what is the purity of ρ2?\n\nX\n\nSolution:\nA general requirement is that the eigenvalues of the two operators are the same. Thus, if one state is pure, the second\nis as well pure, if they are connected by a unitary transformation.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\n22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Propose a quantum mechanical model for the LC circuit and show that its (quantum) energy eigenvalues can be\nwritten in terms of the frequency ω = 1/\n√\nLC.\n2. What is the meaning of the quantum eigenstates?\n[Hint: if you are not satisfied to find the quantum model by simple similarity with a very well-known model, consider\n∂E\n∂E\nthat we have:\n= - Φ and\n\n= Q, thus Φ and Q are generalized canonical variables]\n∂Q\n∂Φ\nSolution:\nGiven the form of the classical hamiltonian, we expect the system to have the form of an harmonic oscillator, with Q\nand Φ playing the role of effective position an momentum. Since we usually have ω =\nk/m we can identify e.g.\nL → 1/k and Φ with the position, while C → m and Q with the momentum.

What is the quantum operator ˆI =\n?\nd t\n2. Is this consistent with the usual expression of the current in terms of the flux, I = Φ/L?\nSolution:\nWe want to calculate Q. To do so, we use the expression for Q and use the Heisenberg equation to find its time\nderivative:\n\ni\n£\n£\n£Z\n\nˆI\n\n= Q\nˆ\nˆ\n=\n[H, Q] = -\nj\nω[a+a,\n(\na + -a\n)\n] =\n£\nj\nω(a + + a) =\nj\n(\na + + a\n)\n=\nΦ\n\n2Z\n2Z\nL\nL\n\nWe thus found that ˆI can be indeed expressed also as ˆΦ/L.\nC) If the current ˆI is a quantum operator, we expect its behavior to be different than the corresponding classical\nvariable. However, if the LC circuit (quantum) system is in a particular state, most of the classical behavior is\nrecovered.\n1. What is this particular state?\n2. What would be instead the expectation value of the current (ˆI) if the state was an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian?\nSolution:\n1. This would be a coherent state of the field, |α), which is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator.\n2. If the system is in one eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, that is, a number state |n), then the expectation value is always\nzero.\nd) What is the expectation value of the current, (ˆI(t)), as a function of time, if the initial state of the LC circuit is as\nyou found in question C.1?\nSolution:\nWe now have the expectation value with respect to the coherent state |α). Now we know that a+(t) = a+(0)eiωt and\na(t) = a(0)e-iωt, thus we have\nj\n£\n\n£\n(Iˆ(t)) =\nω(e iωt (\na +(0)\n)\n+ e -iωt (a(0))) ==\nj\nω[e iωtα∗ (0) + e -iωtα(0)] = (I(0)) cos(ωt + φ)\n2Z\n2Z\nwhich is the classical result.

Find an\n2kZ\nexplicit expression for the equation of motion for ˆA (under the action of the Hamiltonian and the Lindblad operator).\n\n[Note: depending on how you solved Problem 1, it might be easier to calculate the evolution of ˆA′ =\nJ\nˆ\n(Q+iZ ˆΦ)]\n2kZ\nSolution:\n\n√ γ\nThe operator ˆA is nothing else than the annihilation operator a. Writing\n√\nL =\nγ(N + 1/2) =\nk H we have the\nω\nequation of motion:\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)2\na = -iωa -γ\nN +\na\nN +\n-\nN +\na\na\n-\n(\nN +\n)\n-γ\n\na = -iωa\nNaN -\n(N 2 a + aN 2) + a/4 -a/4 + (Na + aN)/2\n-(Na + aN)/2\n\nγ\n= -iωa -\n[N(aN -Na) + (aN -Na)N]\nwe finally obtain:\nγ\na = -iωa -\na\nthus the evolution of A = a is now: a(t) = a(0)e-iωt-γt/2.\nc) Given your result above, what is the time evolution of the expectation value of the current? How does it compare\nto the classical result?\nSolution:\nWe have to add an exponential decay to the time evolution found above:\n(ˆI(t)) = e -γt/2\n1 Φ c\nL\n0 os(ωt) + ωQ0 sin(ωt)\n\na result similar to what found classically.\nProblem 3: Electron scattering from an harmonic potential\n40 points\nWe consider the scattering of an electron from a nucleus. The nucleus-electron potential is given by V ((r, t) =\nV0((r) cos(ωt), where V0((r) represents the potential at the nucleus rest position.\nA) Write a formal expression for the scattering cross section and explain how this is related to perturbation theory.\nSolution:\nThe scattering cross-section can be written in terms of the scattering matrix, which gives the transition probability\nfrom the initial and final state,\nPi\nf = | (f| S |i) |2 = | (f| U (\n→\nI t) |i) |2\nd P\nThe cross-section is then given by the rate of scattering, Ws =\ndivided by the incoming electron flux, Φe:\nd t\nd σ\nWs\n=\nd Ω\nΦe\nB) Calculate the probability of scattering to first order approximation and derive from it the scattering rate.\n[Hint: here you can express your result in terms of Vfi = (f| V0((r) |i) L3 (where L is the side of the usual cubic\ncavity) and the initial and final electron energies E = £\n£\ni\nωi and Ef =\nωf]\nSolution:\nThe scattering probability is given to first order by the propagator in the interaction picture.

Thus the scattering rate can also be calculated very easily.\nC) Assume that the initial and final states of the electron are given by plane waves and calculate\n1. the final density of state (assume no recoil of the nucleus),\n2. the electron flux.\nSolution:\nThe density of state can be calculated from the usual considerations. We consider a cubic cavity that imposes con\nstraints on the acceptable values of the wavenumber kα = nα2π/L, so that\n(\n)3\nL\n£ k2\ndN = ρ(E)dE = n dndΩ =\nk2dkdΩ,\nE =\n2π\n2me\nE\nCalculating d\n= k k, we find:\nd k\nme\n(\n)3\n( L )3\nL\nkme\n√ 2meE\nρ(E) = 2\n= 2\n2π\n£2\n2π\n£3\n(where I consider a factor 2 for the two spin states of the electron, although this might not be necessary if the interaction\nconserves the spin). Note that we need to evaluate ρ(E) at ρ(Ef = Ei + £ω) and ρ(Ef = Ei -£ω).\nD) Using the results from the previous questions, write an explicit expression for the scattering cross-section.\nSolution:\nThe scattering rate is given by\n2π\nW\ns =\nL6|Vfi| [ρ(Ef = Ei + £ω) + ρ(Ef = Ei -£ω)]\n£\n\nThe flux of incoming electron is Φ =\n£\ne\nki/(mL ) =\nd σ\nWs\n2π\n+ 2\nJ\n2E\nm/L3\ni/\n.

We consider a simplified (and sometime\ninaccurate) model of a vapor-cell atomic clock1 .\nLight from a lamp passes through a vapor of rubidium atoms housed\nin a glass cell and is detected by a photodiode. The light intensity\ntransmitted by the vapor is used to lock the frequency of an RF sig\nnal to an atomic transition. The atomic resonance that forms the\nbasis of the Rubidium clocks operation is the transition between two\nhyperfine states F = 1, 2 of 87Rb (see figure).\nmeasure\nt\n0 tμw\nt0\nProblem 1: Rubidium Atomic Clock\n30 points\na) Specifically, we monitor the frequency ω, corresponding to the energy difference between the Zeeman sub-levels\nmF = 0 of the hyperfine angular momentum levels F = 1, 2.\nFormulate the simplest model that describes this atomic clock: What is the Hilbert space? What is a good basis? What\nis the Hamiltonian of interest?\nSolution:\nWe can identify |0) = |F = 1, mF = 0) and |1) = |F =2, mF =0) as the basis for a two-level Hilbert space, with\nHamiltonian:\nH0 = ωσz/2\nI will in the following assume = 1.\nb) The atom is assumed to be at time t = 0 in the state |F =2, mF =0). We turn on a transverse microwave field\nBy(t) = Ω cos(ωt) (on resonance with the |F =1, mF =0) ↔|F =2, mF =0) transition).\nWhat is the total Hamiltonian?\nThe field is turned on only for a time for a time tμw = π/(2Ω). Assuming Ω ≪ ω, what is the state of the atom at\nt = tμw?\nSolution:\nThe microwave is represented by the Hamiltonian\nHμw = Ωσy cos(ωt)\nthus the total Hamiltonian in the Schr odinger (or laboratory) picture is\nω\nH = H0 + Hμw =\nσz + Ωσy cos(ωt)\n1For a more accurate description, see e.g. J.

Then the Hamiltonian is given by\nΩ\nΩ\nΩ\nHI =\nσy +\nσy cos(2ωt)\n≈\nσy\nThus, taking the rotating wave approximation, since Ω ≪ ω, the total Hamiltonian in the interaction picture reduces\nΩ\nto H =\nσy.\nEvolving the state |1) for a time π/(2Ω), we have |ψ)I = √ (|1) -|0)).

We then measure the operator M:\nM = |F =1, mF =0)(F =2, mF =0| + |F =2, mF =0)(F =1, mF =0| .\nWhat is the signal we acquire at time t0?\nSolution:\nThe state at t0 -tμw is\n|ψ(t )) = e -iω(t0-tμw/2)σz |ψ)\n= √ (e iωt0/2|1) -e -iωt0/2\nS\n|0))\nWhat we measure is σx = |0)(1| + |1)(0|, yielding S(t0) = -cos(ωt0).\nNote that if the measurement is also applied in the interaction frame (and this is indeed the usual case) the signal would\nhave been S(t0) = -1 (unless the pulse was applied off-resonance).\nProblem 2: Optical pumping\n40 points\na) We assumed above that the initial state of the atom was |F = 2, mF = 0). In reality we have an ensemble of atoms\nat thermal equilibrium. Specifically, their kinetic energy corresponds to kBT ≈ 40meV, while the energy difference\nbetween the two levels of interest is ΔE ≈ 20μeV. What is the initial state of the atomic ensemble?\n[Write a formal expression for the state and then take the first order approximation in o = ΔE/(kBT )]\nSolution:\nSince we're at thermal equilibrium, it is represented by a mixed state in the macrocanonical ensemble:\n-β\nH\n- ΔE\nσz\no\nρ =\ne\n=\ne\nk\nT\nB\n≈\n(11\nZ\n-\nσz)\nZ\nb) What would be the signal in this case?\nSolution:\nWe can follow the same evolution as before. The signal was\nS(t0) = (ψ|σx|ψ) = Tr {σx|ψ)(ψ|}\nNow we just have to replace |ψ)(ψ| with the new state. We calculated that the microwave irradiation corresponds to a\nπ/2 rotation about the y axis. Thus we have at t = tμw\no\no\nρI =\n(11 -\nσx)\n→\nρS = e -iωtμwσz/2ρ\niωtμwσz/2\nIe\n=\n(11 -\n[σx cos(ωtμw) + σy sin(ωtμw)]),\nwhere I used the well known rotation about the z-axis of σx.\no\nSince the identity is not contributing to the signal, we have S(t0, o) = -\ncos(ωt0). The signal is thus very small, as\no is small.\n\nc) Because for a thermal state the signal is very small, we want to polarize the atomic ensemble. To do so, we send a\ncontinuous stream of light into the atomic ensemble.\nThe light is thus the \"environment\" with ground state |1) (one photon). When the atom interacts with the light, it can\nabsorb one photon with probability p, only if the atom is in the state |F =1, mF =0) (and causing a transition to the\nstate |F =2, mF =0)).\nWrite Kraus operators describing this process.\nSolution:\nThe process described is the following:\nU |11) = |11)\nU\n= √\n|01)\np |10) +\n1 -p |01)\nThus the Kraus operators are\ny\nM1 = |1)(1| +\ny\n1 -p|0)(0|,\nM2 = √ p|1)(0|\nd) If the initial, thermal state is what you found in question (a), what is the state after applying once this process?\nSolution:\n\ntate as ρ\n\nWe can write the s\n= 1-o ′ |0)(0| + 1+o ′ |1)(1|. Applying the Kraus sum, we have:\n1 -o ′\n1 + o ′\n1 -o ′\n1 -o ′\no ′\nρ ′ =\n(1 -p)|0)(0| + [\n+ p\n]|1)(1 =\n-\n|\n(1 -p)|0)(0| + [1\n-\n(1 -p)]|1)(1\n|\nThus, while the population in the ground state decreases, the population in the excited state increases: indeed, the\nabsorption of photons create a population inversion, with a higher probability of the atom to be in the excited state.\ne) Assuming that the probability of photon absorption in a small time δt is δp = Γδt, what is the state at a time\ntn = nδt?\nSolution:\nFrom the expression above we see that at each application of the Kraus map, the population of the zero state reduces\nby a factor 1 -p. Thus after n repetitions of the map, we expect to have the state\no ′\no ′\nρ\nn\nn = (1\nδ\n-\n-\n-p)\n|0)(0| + [1 -(1 -δp)n\n]|1\n)(1|,\nwhere I used the requirement of having trace 1 to simplify the calculations. Using the definitions of δp and n given\nabove, we have\ntn/δt 1 -o ′\n1 + o ′\nρn = (1 -δtΓ)\n|0)(0| + [1 -(1 -δtΓ)tn/δt\n]|1)(1|,\nwhich for δt → 0 gives an exponential decay, with a state\n1 -o ′\n1 + o ′\nρ(tn) =\ne -Γtn |0)(0\n| + [1 -\ne -Γtn ]|1)(1\n|\nf) What would be the signal if we take this as the initial state before performing the evolution described in the previous\nquestion?\nSolution:\nWe can rewrite the state found above as\no\nρ(t\nΓtn\nn) =\n-\n[1 -(1 -\n)e -\n]σz\nThus we have a signal as calculated in Question b, but replacing o/2 with the value 1 -(1 - o )e-Γtn,\no\nS(t0, tn) = -\n[\n1 -\n(\n1 -\n)\ne -Γtn ]\ncos(2ωt0).\nFor tn →infwe recover the signal S(t0, tn) ≈-cos(2ωt0) that we had for an initial pure state.\n\nProblem 3: Clock Accuracy Limit\n30 points\nWe go back to the evolution described in Problem 1, but we now consider a more realistic system. Specifically, we\ntake into account that the atoms collide with the wall of the glass cell. Each collision randomizes the phase of the\natomic state.\na) We can model the collisions as causing a \"jump\" of the phase described by the operator\ny\nΓ2 |F =2, mF =0)(F =2, mF =0| .\nWrite a differential equation describing the system's evolution between time tμw and t0.\nUnder which assumption(s) is this equation valid?\nSolution:\nThe jump corresponds to a Lindblad operator L =\n√\nΓ2|1)(1|. We have the Lindblad equation\nd ρ\n= i[H0, ρ] -LρL+ +\n(L+Lρ + ρL+L)\nd t\nd ρ\n= i[\n0, ρ]\nΓ2( 1 ρ 1 1 1\nρ 1 1\n1 1 ρ) = iω\n\n(0|ρ|1)\n(0|ρ|1)\nd t\nH\n-\n( | | )| )( | - 2 | )( | - 2| )( |\n1 ρ 0\n\n-Γ\n\n-( | | )\n(1|ρ\n\n|0)\nWe can write a Lindblad equation only if the noise process is Markovian (memory-less). For this particular physical\nmodel this means that in each collision with the wall the phase is changed at random and there is no correlation\nbetween the phase change in different collisions.\nb) Assume that tμwΓ2 ≪ 1, so that there are no collision during the rf pulse time (and we can consider the same\nevolution as in Problem 1 and the same state at t = tμw). What is the state at time t0? What is the signal?\nSolution:\nThe state we had found at time t = tμw was |ψ)I = √ (|1) -|0)) or |ψ)\n= √ (eiωtμw/2\niωtμw\nS\n|1) -e-\n/2|0)). We\nstudy the evolution under H0 and the collisions of this state,\n-e-iωtμw/2\nρ(tμw) = 2\niωtμw/2\n\n-e\nFrom the Lindblad differential equation above, we have\n\nρ\n00 = ρ 11 = 0\nρ 01 = (iω -Γ)ρ01\nρ 10 = -(iω + Γ)ρ10,\nwhere I defined ρij = (i| ρ |j). Thus at a time t0 we have\ne-iωt0/2e-Γ2t0\nρ(tμw) =\niωt0/2\nΓ2t0\n-\n\n=\n-[σx cos(ωt0) + σy sin(ωt0)]e-Γ2t0\n-e\ne-\n\n[Note that more precisely I should have written e-Γ2(t0-tμw) but as assumed above I neglect the term tμwΓ2 ≪ 1]\nc) A measure of the accuracy of a clock is the ratio of its signal mean frequency ν to its spread in frequency Δν,\nQ =\nν . Given the Fourier transform of the signal you found above, what is Q? What constraint does this impose on\nΔν\nthe rate of collision?\nSolution:\nThe signal we would measure in the presence of collisions is S(t0) = -cos(ωt0)e-Γ2t0, with Fourier Transform a\nLorenztian centered around ω0 and width Γ2. We thus have ν = ω and Δν = Γ2. Thus we want the rate of collision\nto be much smaller than the clock frequency. This is obtained using a buffer gas.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\n22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nMid-Term Exam\nOctober 27, 2010\nSolution\nProblem 1:\nElectron Spin: Magnetization\n20 points\nConsider an isolated electron with spin- 1, placed in a large magnetic f eld B = Bzz at zero temperature. The spin is\nin the state\nψ = c0\n+ c1\nwhere |↑⟩≡|S = + ħ\n| ⟩\n|↑⟩\n|↓⟩\nz\n⟩(|↓⟩≡|S\nħ\nz = -⟩) represents the spin state aligned (anti-aligned) with the vertical z-axis.\nWe now assume that we can measure the magnetic dipole\n\nμ = γS = γ\nσ\nħ\nof this single spin (with γ the gyromagnetic\nratio of the electronic spin):\na) What is the probability of f nding an outcome μz > 0? What is the spin state immediately after the measurement?\nSolution:\nThe eigenstates of μz are |↑⟩and |1⟩with eigenvalues ±γ ħ. Assuming γ > 0, the probability of f nding μz > 0 in a\nmeasurement is simply p(μ\nz > 0) = |c0| . The spin state is projected into the corresponding eigenstate |ψ⟩′ = |↑⟩.\n(For γ < 0 it would have been p(μz > 0) = |c1|2 and |ψ⟩′ = |↓⟩)\nb) What is the average magnetization ⟨μz⟩in the z direction?\nSolution:\nWe need to calculate ⟨ψ|μz|ψ⟩= (c∗\n0⟨↑| + c∗\n1⟨↓|)μz(c0|↑⟩+ c1|↓⟩). Since μz is already diagonal in the basis |↑⟩, |↓⟩\nthis is simply ⟨μz⟩= γ ħ(|c0|2 -|c1|2) = γ\nħ(\n|c0| -1).\nc)\nIf the magnetic f eld is aligned with the z-axis, B = Bzz and the spin is in its ground state, what are c0 and c1?\nWhat is now ⟨μz⟩?\n[Assume that the only interaction is the Zeeman interaction, HZ = ħγBzσz/2]\nSolution:\nThe energy levels of the Zeeman interaction are simply the eigenvalues of HZ, ±γB\nħ\nz\ncorresponding to the eigen-\nvectors |↑⟩, |↓⟩. Assuming Bz > 0 and γ > 0 (or more generally γBz > 0), the eigenvector |↓⟩has thus the lowest\nenergy. Then the state is simply |ψ⟩= |↓⟩, that is |c1| = 1 (or c1 = 1 up to an unimportant phase factor) and c0 = 0.\nThe average magnetization is then ⟨μ\nħ\nz⟩= -γ .\nIf γBz < 0 the ground state is instead |↑⟩and ⟨μz⟩= γ ħ.\nNow assume that we cannot achieve zero temperature, but only a temperature T (as provided e.g. by liquid Nitrogen),\nso that the spin is at thermal equilibrium in the f eld B = Bzz.\nd) What is the state of the spin?\nSolution:\nAt f nite temperature, we expect to have a mixed state as given by the canonical ensemble. Thus the state is given by\nρ = e-βHZ/Z, where Z = Tr\n\ne-βHZ\n. For this simple Hamiltonian we can calculate the state explicitly:\ne-βγB ħ\nz /2|↑⟩⟨↑| + eβγB ħ\nz /2\nρ =\n|↓⟩⟨↓|\ne-βγB ħ\nz /2 + eβγB ħ\nz /2\n\nNotice that the partition function Z = 2 cosh (βγB ħ\nz /2). We can also write the state as:\nρ = e-βHZ/Z = [cosh (βγB ħ\nz /2)11 -sinh (βγB ħ\nz /2)σz]/Z =\n[11 -tanh (βγB ħ\nz /2)σz]\ne) What is the average magnetization? How many spins would you need in order to achieve the same magnetization\nas in question c?\n[Hint: you can assume a temperature T = 77K which corresponds to ≈1600GHz and a magnetic f eld B ≈6 Tesla\nwhich gives a Zeeman energy ħγB ≈160GHz. ]\nSolution:\nFor a mixed state, the expectation value of an observable is ⟨O⟩= Tr {ρO}. Thus the magnetization is ⟨μz⟩=\nTr {ρμz} or:\ne-βγB ħ\n+\nβγB ħ\nz /2\ne\nz /2\nγħ\n⟨μz⟩= Tr\nβ\n|↑⟩\nħ\n⟨\n(\n)\ne-γBz /\n↑\n|\n|↓\n+ eβγB ħ\nz /2\n⟩⟨↓|\n|↑⟩⟨↑| -|↓⟩⟨↓|\n\nγħe-βγB ħ\nz /2\neβγB ħ\nz /2\nγħ\n=\n=\ntanh(βγB ħ\nz /2)\n2 e-βγB ħ\nħ\nz /2\n-\n+ eβγBz /2\n-2\nThis result could have been found also by remembering that all average properties of a system can be found from the\npartition function, in particular the internal energy is ⟨E⟩= -∂ln Z . The magnetization μz is related to the internal\n∂β\nenergy by the simple relation Hz = μzBz. Then\n1 ∂ln Z\n∂Z\nγħBz\n2 sinh (βγB ħ/2)\nγħ\n⟨\nz\nμz⟩= -\n=\n=\n=\ntanh(βγB ħ\nz /2)\nBz\n∂β\n-BzZ ∂β\n-\nB\n(βγB ħ\nz2 cosh\nz /2)\n-2\nAt the temperature given,\n≈\nK,\n≈\nGHz. Then\n≈1 160GHz\nT\n1/β = kbT\nβγB ħ\nz /2\n=\n1 . To f rst order\n2 1600GHz\ntanh (0.05) ≈0.05. Then the magnetization of one spin at 77K is ⟨μz⟩= -γħ1 and we need about 20 spins to have\n2 20\nthe same amount of magnetization as one spin at zero temperature.\nProblem 2:\nElectronic Spin: Dynamics\n30 points\nWe consider again an electronic spin-1/2 subjected to an external f eld Bz via the Zeeman interaction.\na)\nWe consider two cases, where the initial state is either what you found in Problem 1, question c or in Problem 1,\nquestion d. The initial state is rotated by 90*by the operator Uy = eiπ/4σy, to be aligned with the x-axis and it then\nevolves under the Zeeman interaction.\nBy choosing the most eff cient \"picture\" (Schr odinger , Heisenberg or interaction picture), calculate ⟨μx(t)⟩for the\ntwo initial states. [Hint: i) What is UeAU + for U unitary? ii) eABe-A = B + [A, B] + . . . 1 [A, [A, [. . . , B]]].]\nn!\nSolution:\nSince we want to calculate the evolution of an observable (and for different initial states) it is more convenient to adopt\nthe Heisenberg picture, in which the observables are time-dependent and the states are constant.\nFirst we calculate μx(t) in the Heisenberg picture under the action of the the Zeeman Hamiltonian HZ.\nħγ\nμ (t) = U +(t)μ)x(0)U(t) = eiHzt/ħ\n\nσ\n\ne-iHzt/ħ\nx\nx\nNow HZ = ħγBzσz/2 and we can call ω = γBz. Also remember that\neiωtσz/2σ e-iωtσz/2\nx\n= σx cos(ωt) -σy sin(ωt).\nThis could have also been calculated from the formula above, eABe-A = B + [A, B] + . . . 1 [A, [A, [. . . , B]]], with\nn!\nA = iωt/2σz and B = σx and the usual commutation relationships of the Pauli matrices. Then\nħγ\nμz(t) =\n(σx cos(ωt)\n-σy sin(ωt))\n\nand ⟨μx(t)⟩= ħγ (⟨σx⟩cos(ωt) + sin(ωt) ⟨σy⟩). We thus need to calculate ⟨σx⟩and σy with respect to the two\n⟨\n⟩\ninitial states (pure state at zero temperature and mixed state). The initial states after the rotation Uy are :\neβħγBzσx/2\nUy|↓⟩= |+⟩= √(\n2 |↑⟩+ |↓⟩),\nU\n-βHZ\ny\ne\n/Z\n\nUy\n+ = 2 cosh (βγB ħ\nz /2)\nwhich follows from\nA\n+\nUAU+\nUe U = e\nand UyσzUy\n+ = -σx. Also notice that this state can be written as:\neβħγBzσx/2\nρx =\n=\n[11 + tanh (βγB ħ\nz /2)σx]\n2 cosh(βγB ħ\nz /2)\nFrom these states we can calculate ⟨σ ⟩= ⟨+|σ |+⟩= 1 and Tr {ρ σ } = tanh(βγB ħ\nx\nx\nx\nx\nz /2), while ⟨σy⟩= 0 for\nboth states. Notice that these results could have been obtained even by simply noting that after rotating the states,\nthe expectation value of σx should have been equal to the expectation value of σz (calculate in Problem 1) before the\nrotation.\nFinally, we have ⟨μx(t)⟩= γħcos(γBzt) for the ground state at zero temperature and\n⟨μx(t)⟩= γħtanh(βγB ħ\nz /2) cos(γBzt) for the thermal state.\nb) We now want to describe the thermalization process that gives rise to the state you found in Problem 1.d. When\nwe raise the temperature from T = 0 to T ≈77K, the electronic spin will undergo an evolution to reach a new\nthermal state under the action of the Zeeman Hamiltonian and the coupling with a reservoir. We can represent this\nthermalization process by the Lindblad operators L1 = √ασ , L2 = √1 -ασ+where σ\n-\n+ = |0⟩⟨1| (σ\n=\n-\n|1⟩⟨0|)\nand α =\n[1 -tanh(βħγBz/2)]. Write out the Lindblad equation describing the total evolution of the system.\nSolution:\nThe Lindblad equation is the differential equation:\nρ (t) = -i[H, ρ(t)] +\nX\nLkρ(t)L+\nk -\n(L+\nkLkρ(t) + ρ(t)L+\nkLk)\nk\n\nIn the specif c case of the problem this becomes:\nρ = -i ħω[σz, ρ] + α\n1 ρ 1 0 0\n( 1 1 ρ + ρ 1\n\n⟨| | ⟩| ⟩⟨| -2 | ⟩⟨|\n| ⟩⟨1|)\n\n+ (1 -α)\n\n⟨0|ρ|0⟩|1⟩⟨1| -\n(\n2 |0⟩⟨0|ρ + ρ|0⟩⟨0|)\n\nwhere we used the fact that (σ )+σ\n= (|1⟩⟨0|)(|0⟩⟨1|) = |1⟩⟨1| and σ+\n-\n-\n+σ+ = |0⟩⟨0|.\nc)\nWhat is ρ0 0, where ρ00 = ⟨0|ρ|0⟩? What is ρ 11? Take the steady-state (SS) limit of the system of equations you\nfound and calculate ρSS\n00 and ρSS\n11 . Compare the result with the state you found in Problem 1.d.\nSolution:\nWe need to project out ⟨0|ρ |0⟩:\nρ0 0 = ⟨0|\n\n-i ħω[σz, ρ]\n\n|0⟩+ α⟨0|\n\nρ11\n|0⟩⟨0| -\n( 1 1 ρ + ρ 1 1 )\n2 | ⟩⟨|\n| ⟩⟨|\n\n| ⟩\n+(1 -α)⟨0|\n\nρ00|1⟩⟨1| -\n(|0⟩⟨0|ρ + ρ\n|0⟩⟨0|)\n\n|0⟩\nThe f rst term is zero, since σz = |0⟩⟨0| -|1⟩⟨1| yielding ⟨0|[σz, ρ]|0⟩= ⟨0|(σzρ -ρσz)|0⟩= ⟨0|ρ|0⟩-⟨0|ρ|0⟩. The\nsecond term yields αρ11 and the third term -(1 -α)ρ00. Thus we have:\nρ0 0 = αρ11 -(1 -α)ρ00\nWe can calculate ρ 11 in a similar way, or remember that ρ11 + ρ00 = 1 so that ρ 11 = -ρ 00:\nρ 11 = -αρ11 + (1 -α)ρ00\nWe then have the system of equations:\nρ0 0 = α -ρ00\nρ1 1 = (1 -α) -ρ11\n\nAt the steady state,\nwe obtain\n-βħγB\n/2\nρ = 0\nρ00 = α =\n1[1 -tanh(βħγBz/2)] =\ne\nz\nħ\nand ρ\n11 =\n[1 +\n2 cosh(β γBz/2)\nβħγB\n/2\ntanh(β γB / )] =\ne\nz 2\nz\nħ\nħ\n. These are the same values as for the thermal state in Problem 1. If we can prove\n2 cosh(β γBz/2)\nthat at the steady state ρ10 = ρ∗\n01 = 0 then we have recovered the thermal state.\nNotice that in the Exam I had written α = 1[1 -tanh(βħγBz/2)] which would have given a result off by a factor 2\nd)\nNow calculate as well ρ0 1 and the relative steady-state ρSS\n01 to prove that the steady-state is indeed the thermal\nstate found in Problem 1.d.\nSolution:\nBy taking the projection ⟨0|ρ |1⟩we obtain :\nρ 01 = -iħωρ01 -\nαρ\nħ\n01 -\n(1 -α)ρ01 = -(i ω + 1)ρ01\nThen, at the steady-state ρ01 = 0. Thus the equilibrium state (such that ρ = 0) reached under the action of this\nLindbladian process is indeed the thermal equilibrium.\nProblem 3:\nNeutron interferometer\n20 points\nConsider a Mach-Zehnder neutron interferometer such as the one seen in class and in the problem sets. The possible\nstates of the neutrons are described by its momentum, either |U⟩for neutrons moving upward or |D⟩for neutrons\nmoving downward.\n|ψ〉0=|U〉\n|D〉\nBS\nBS\nMirror\nPhase\n|ψ〉2\n|ψ〉1\n|ψ〉3\n|ψ〉4\nU-detector\nD-detector\nz\ncollimator\nThe interferometer components act on the neutrons passing through with the following unitary operators:\n\n0 1\neiφU\nUBS = √\nU\n-\nmirror =\nU\n\n1 0\n\nphase =\n\neiφD\n\nwhere BS stands for beam-splitter. Uphase represents a phase shift that neutrons acquire when passing through a material\nsample: the phase is φU for neutrons crossing the material while going upward and φD for neutrons going downward.\na) We send in a beam of neutrons moving upward, |ψ0⟩= |U⟩. What is the neutron state at each step, 1-4? (see f g.)\nSolution:\nWith simple matrix multiplications we have:\nψ1 = √( U + D )\n2 | ⟩\n|\n⟩\nψ = √(eiφU\nφ\n|U⟩+ ei\nD\n|D⟩)\nψ3 = √(eiφU\n|D⟩+ eiφD|U⟩)\nψ4 =\n[eiφU (|U⟩-|D )\n⟩+ eiφD(|U⟩+ |D⟩)]\n\nb) What is the measured contrast? [Hint: we def ne the contrast as the difference in the number of neutrons measured\nat the detector U and the detector D that measure neutrons moving upward and downward respectively.]\nSolution:\nThe contrast operator is def ned as C = |U⟩⟨U| -|D⟩⟨D|. We can rewrite |ψ⟩4 as\n|ψ⟩=\nei(φU +φD)/2 h\nei(φU -φD)/2\n(\n|U⟩-|D⟩) + e-i(φU -φD)/2(|U⟩+ |D⟩)\ni\n= ei(φU+φD)/2 [cos [(φU -φD)/2]|U⟩-i sin [(φU -φD)/2]|D⟩]\nFrom this expression, it is easy to f nd the contrast as\n⟨\nC⟩= cos [(φU -φD)/2] -sin [(φU -φD)/2] = cos(φU -φD).\nc) We now change the sample inside the interferometer so that the neutron will acquire a phase φ′\nU = φU -φD when\ntraveling upward and φ′\nD = 0 otherwise. How do your answers to questions a-b change?\nSolution:\nWith this new sample, the state |ψ⟩4 is\niφ′\n|ψ⟩4 =\n[e\nU (\n|U⟩-|D⟩) + (|U⟩+ |\n′\nD⟩)] =\neiφU/2[eiφ′\nU /2(|U⟩-|D⟩) + e-iφ′\nU /2(\n|U⟩+ |D⟩)]\nNotice that this state is exactly the same as written above to calculate the contrast. Since a global phase eiφ′\nU /2 is\nunimportant when calculating expectation values, we f nd the same contrast: ⟨C⟩= cos (φ′\nU) = cos(φU -φD).\nProblem 4:\nFaulty neutron interferometer\n30 points\nConsider the same neutron interferometer as in Problem 3.c, but now assume that the mirrors are faulty: Instead of\nref ecting all the neutrons, they let pass some of them. We can describe the process as follow:\nThe mirrors are initially in their ground state, |ψ⟩mirror = |0⟩. When one neutron traveling upward impacts the mirror,\nit is ref ected with probability p (leaving the mirrors in the ground state) or it continues upward with probability 1 -p,\nleaving the mirrors in the state |1⟩. When one neutron traveling downward impacts the mirror, it is ref ected with\nprobability p (leaving the mirrors in the ground state) or it continues downward with probability 1 -p, leaving the\nmirrors in the state |2⟩.\na) Describes formally this process giving the rules for the transitions |U⟩|0⟩mirror →. . . and |D⟩|0⟩mirror →. . . .\nSolution:\nThe possible transitions described in this process are given by the propagator Unm acting on both neutron and mirror:\n|U⟩|0⟩mirror →Unm|U⟩|0⟩mirror = √p|D⟩|0⟩mirror +\np\n1 -p|U⟩|1⟩mirror\n|D⟩|0⟩mirror →Unm|D⟩|0⟩mirror = √p|U⟩|0⟩mirror +\np\n1 -p|D⟩|2⟩mirror\nb) For which values of φ′\nU is the mirror+neutron system entangled (at the step 3)?\nSolution:\nEntanglement between the mirror and the neutron does not depend on φ′\nU (which def nes only a phase of the neutron\nstate), but it can depend on p.\nWe calculated |ψ⟩=\n√(eiφ′\nU |U⟩+ |D⟩). Considering now the mirror system as well, we have:\n|Ψ⟩2 = √\n′\n(eiφU |U⟩|0⟩mirror + |D⟩|0⟩mirror)\n\nAfter the interaction with the mirror, we have:\n|Ψ⟩= √[eiφ′\nU\n(√p|D⟩|0⟩mirror +\np\nU\n-p| ⟩|1⟩mirror) +\n√\n|D⟩(\np|U⟩|0⟩mirror +\np\n1 -p|D⟩|2⟩mirror)]\n√\n′\n= √[\np(eiφ′\nU |D⟩+ |U⟩)|0⟩mirror +\np\n1 -p(eiφU |U⟩|1⟩mirror + |D⟩|2⟩mirror)]\nThis state cannot be written as |ψ⟩neutron ⊗|φ⟩mirror thus it is entangled. To conf rm this, we can take the partial trace\nover the mirror:\nρ3 = Trmirror {|Ψ3⟩⟨Ψ3|} = p|ψ3⟩⟨ψ3| +\n(1\n-p)11\n(where |ψ3⟩= (eiφ′\nU |D⟩+ |U ) is the state found in Problem 3 for perfect mirrors.) This reduced state is a mixed\nstate, as conf rmed by Tr\n\nρ2\n⟩\n= [p2 + (1 -p)2/2 + p] =\n(p2 + 1) < 1.\nNotice that in all this calcula\n\ntion, the value of φ′\nU is unimportant and the state is always entangled (unless p = 1 or\np = 0).\nc) Write the Kraus operators that describe the faulty mirrors and the evolution |ψ2⟩→ρ3. What is ρ3? What type of\nprocess is this Kraus sum describing for p →0?\nSolution:\nThe Kraus operators are Mk = ⟨k|Unm|0⟩:\nM0 = √pσx,\nM1 =\np\n1 -p|U⟩⟨U|,\nM2 =\np\n1 -p|D⟩⟨D|\nand ρ3 = P2\nk=0 Mkρ2Mk, with ρ2 = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|2 =. We obtain:\nρ3 = pσxρ2σx + (1 -p)(⟨0|ρ2|0⟩|0⟩⟨0| + ⟨1|ρ2|1⟩|1⟩⟨1| = p|ψ3⟩⟨ψ3| +\n(1\n-p)11\nNotice that the diagonal terms of the density operator are swapped but not reduced in intensity, while the off-diagonal\nterms are reduced by an amount p. Thus, as the quality of the mirror decreases, p →0 and the off-diagonal terms go\nto zero; since the phase coherence of the state is lost, the process can be classif ed as a dephasing process. Notice that\nit is different then what seen in class, since it is combined with the σx operator, inverting the populations.\nd) What is the contrast obtained in this faulty interferometer?\nSolution:\nThe contrast is now given by ⟨C⟩= Tr {ρ4C}, where ρ4 = UBSρ3UB\n+\nS. By linearity,\nρ4 = p|ψ4⟩⟨ψ4| +\n(1\n-p)11\nThen ⟨C⟩= Tr {Cp|ψ4⟩⟨ψ4|} = p cos(φ′\nU).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\n22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Rev. 47, 777 - 780 (1935)\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of\nreality.A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the\npossibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In\nquantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-\ncommuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the\nother.Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in\nquantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have\nsimultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions\nconcerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system\nthat had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false\nthen (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of\nreality as given by a wave function is not complete.\nAbstract (c) American Physical Society. All rights reserved.

      "content": "1. Introduction to the course\n1.1\nWhy study Quantum Mechanics?\n1.2\nStriking Characteristics of QM\n1.1 Why study Quantum Mechanics?\nQuantum mechanics (QM) is a fundamental and general theory that applies on a very wide range of scale, from\nsubatomic systems to astrophysical objects.\nIt is nowadays also a widely applied subject, with real-life applications (from transistors to lasers) and an active area\nof research. For example, it is at the basis of research in nanotechnology, in materials science, in spintronics (where\nthe electron spin replaces the charge as the fundamental unit for storing information in a computer), etc.\nAlso, there has been a resurgent interest in the fundamental theory of QM, due to the interest in quantum information\nas well as the availability of control on single quantum systems1. Although you might not be directly interested in\nquantum information per se, this discipline has shaped a new view of QM that is having impact also on practical\napplications. On the pedagogical side, it has pushed for a new way of presenting QM in college courses, that I will try\nto partially follow here, with more emphasis on discrete systems and applications instead of an historical presentation\nof QM theory. (You probably already have had that kind of historical introduction, both in undergrad and in 22.101).\n1.2 Striking Characteristics of QM\nQM is known for being weird, counterintuitive and difficult to understand2. The vast majority of physicists do not\nworry about the puzzling aspects of quantum mechanics, but simply use it as a tool without asking questions of\nprinciple. Nevertheless, the theoretical and, especially, experimental progress made over the past twenty years have\nled to a better grasp of certain aspects of the behavior of quantum objects.\nIn this class we will explore these counterintuitive phenomena, in particular we will emphasize three characteristics\nof QM:\n- Discreteness\nThis is the characteristic that gave the discipline its name of quantum mechanics3. While classical physics and the\nword around us seems to be continuous, in QM some quantities can only take a discrete set of values. Examples are\nthe discrete energy levels of atoms or the amount of energy emitted in black body radiation (these are historical\nexamples). In the first part of the course we will focus on discrete systems, in particular on a system that can\nassume only two states.\n1 This is exemplified by the work of the two Physics Nobel laureates in 2012, Dave Wineland and Serge Haroche.\n2 For those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it. Niels Bohr,\nquoted in Heisenberg, Werner (1971). Physics and Beyond. New York: Harper and Row. pp. 206. I think I can safely say that\nnobody understands quantum mechanics. Richard Feynman, in The Character of Physical Law (1965)\n3 Etymology: Latin, neuter of quantus how much. Plural quanta. 1 a : quantity, amount. b : a certain or an allotted amount\n: portion (from Merriam-Webster dictionary).\n\n- Interference\nInterference and diffraction are characteristics of waves, in particular light. In QM it was found that interference\nalso applied to matter and it is actually a general phenomenon. E.g. diffraction observed with large objects such\nas fullurenes (C60). We will see how interference is linked to the possibility of finding a system in a superposition\nstate and further explore even weirder phenomena such as entanglement.\n- Phase coherence\nThe ability to observe interferences is linked to ability for a system to maintain a phase coherence among the\ndifferent parts in a superposition state. Conversely, the loss of this phase coherence is linked to the disappearance\nof the QM properties of a system and the observation of classical physics behavior. This occurs e.g. when the\nsystem interacts with an environment and a good part of this course will focus on the study of these so-called\nopen quantum systems.\nReferences\n- A. Tonomura, J.

Our main interest will be in\nanalyzing phenomena linked to atomic physics and quantum optics, in which atoms interacts with radiation. Some\nprocesses can be analyzed with a classical description: for example we studied the precessing and the manipulation\nof a spin by classical static and rf magnetic fields. Absorption and emission of light by an atom can also be described\nas the interaction with a classical field. Some other phenomena, such as spontaneous emission, can only arise from a\nQM description of both the atom and the field. There are various examples in which the importance of a quantum\ntreatment of electromagnetism becomes evident:\n- Casimir force\n- Spontaneous emission, Lamb Shift\n- Laser linewidth, photon statistics\n- Squeezed photon states, states with subpoissonian distribution,\n- Quantum beats, two photon interference, etc.\n10.1 Classical theory of the e.m. field\nBefore introducing the quantization of the field, we want to review some basic (and relevant) concepts about e.m.\nfields.\nMaxwell equations for the electric and magnetic fields, E and B, are:\nGauss's law\n∇· E =\nρ\nε0\nGauss's law for magnetism\n∇· B = 0\nMaxwell-Faraday equation (Faraday's law of induction)\n∇× E = -1 ∂B\nc ∂t\nAmpere's circuital law (with Maxwell's correction)\n∇× B = μ0J + μ0ε\n∂E\n0 ∂t\nWe will be interested to their solution in empty space (and setting c = 1/√μ0ε0):\nGauss's law\nE = 0\nGauss's law for magnetism\n∇·\n∇· B = 0\nMaxwell-Faraday equation\n∇× E = -1 ∂B\nc ∂t\nAmpere's circuital law\n∇× B = 1 ∂E\nc ∂t\n\nCombining Maxwell equation in vacuum, we find the wave equations:\n1 ∂2E\n∇E -\n= 0\nB\nc2\nt2\n∇2\n1 ∂2B\n∂\n-\n= 0\nc2 ∂t2\n? Question: Show how this equation is derived\nWe need to take the curl of Maxwell-Faraday equation and the time derivative of Ampere's law and use the vector identity\n∇× (∇× v) = ∇(∇· v) -∇2v and Gauss law.\n\nA general solution for these equations can be written simply as E = E(ωt\nk x). By fixing the boundary conditions,\nwe can find a solution in terms of an expansion in normal modes, where th\n-\ne tim\n·\ne dependence and spatial dependence\nare separated. The solution of the wave equation can thus be facilitated by representing the electric field as a sum of\nnormal mode functions:\nE(x, t) =\nfm(t)um(x).\nm\nThe normal modes u\nare the equivalent of eigenfunc\nX\nm\ntions for the wave equation, so they do not evolve in time\n(i.e. they are function of position only). The um are orthonormal functions, called normal modes. The boundary\nconditions define the normal modes um for the field, satisfying:\n∇2um = -k2\nmum,\n∇· um = 0,\nn × um = 0\n(where n is a unit vector normal to a surface). This last condition is imposed because the tangential component of\nthe electric field E must vanish on a conducting surface. We can also choose the modes to satisfy the orthonomality\ncondition (hence normal modes):\nZ\num(x)un(x)d3x = δn,m\nSubstituting the expression for the electric field in the wave equation, we find an equation for the coefficient fm(t):\nX d2fm + c2k2\nmfm(t) = 0.\ndt2\nm\nSince the mode functions are linearly independent, the coefficients of each mode must separately add up to zero in\norder to satisfy the wave equation, and we find :\nd2fm + c2k2\ndt2\nmfm(t) = 0.\nAs it can be seen from this equation, the dynamics of the normal modes, as described by their time-dependent\ncoefficients, is the same as that of the h.o. with frequency ωm = ckm. Hence the electric field is equivalent to an\ninfinite number of (independent) harmonic oscillators. In order to find a quantum-mechanical description of the e.m.\nfield we will need to turn this h.o. into quantum harmonic oscillators.\nWe want to express the magnetic field in terms of the same normal modes um which are our basis. We assume for B\nthe expansion:\nB(x, t) =\nhn(t) [\nn\n∇× un(x)] ,\nFrom Maxwell-Faraday law:\nX\n∇× E =\nX\nfn(t)∇× un =\n∂\nc\nn\n-\ntB\nwe see that we need to impose hn such that d hn = -cfn so that we obtain\nd t\nX\n1 d h\nn\n-\nn\nc d t ∇× un = -∂tB\nc\n\nwhich indeed corresponds to the desired expression for the magnetic field. We now want to find as well an equation\nfor the coefficient hn alone. From the expressions of the E and B-field in terms of normal modes, using Ampere's\nlaw,\n1 ∂E\nd f\n∇× B =\n→\nX\nn\nhn(t)∇× (∇× un) =\nX\nun\nc ∂t\nc\nd t\nn\nn\n→\n-\nhn∇2\nd fn\nun =\nun\nc\nd t\nn\nn\n(where we used the fact that\nX\nX\n∇· u = 0) we find\ndfn(t) = ck2\nnhn(t).\ndt\nsince we have ∇2un = -k2\nnun. Finally we have:\nd2\nhn(t) + c2k2hn(t) = 0\ndt2\nn\nThe Hamiltonian of the system represent the total energy33\nP\n: H = 1 1\n(E + B2)d3x.\n2 4π\nWe can show that H =\nn\n(fn + k\nnh\nπ\nn):\nR\nH =\nZ\n(E2 + B2)d3\nx =\nX\nfnfm\nZ\nu\nx\n)d3x +\nn( )um(x\nhnhm\nπ\n8π n,m\nZ\n(∇× un) · (∇× um)d x\n\n=\nX 1 (f 2 +\n8π\nn\nk2\nnh2\nn)\nn\nwhere we used\nR\n(∇×\nf\nun) (\nm)d3x = k2\nd\n(t)\nu\nnδn,m. We can then use the equation\nn\n= ck2\nnhn(t) to eliminate\ndt\nhn.Then fn can be associat\n·\ned\n∇\nw\n×\nith an equivalent position operator and hn (being a derivative of the position) with\nthe momentum operator.\nNotice that the Hamiltonian for a set of harmonic oscillators, each having unit mass, is\nHh.o. =\nX\n(p2\nn + ωnq2\nn)\nn\nwith q\nd\nn, pn =\nqn the position and momentum of each oscillator.\ndt\n10.2 Quantization of the e.m. field\nGiven the Hamiltonian we found above, we can associate the energy 1(p2\nn + ω2q2\nn) to each mode. We thus make the\nidentification of fn with an equivalent position:\nfn\nQn = 2ωn\n√π\nand then proceed to quantize this effective position, associating an operator to the position Qn:\nˆQn =\nr\nħ(a+\n)\nn + an\nωn\nWe can also associate an operator to the normal mode coefficients fn:\nˆfn =\n2πω ħ\nn (a+\nn + an)\n33 The factor 4π is present because I am using cgs unit\np\ns, in SI units the energy density is o0 (E2 + c2B2).\n\nNotice that fn(t) is a function of time, so also the operators an(t) are (Heisenberg picture). The electric field is the\nsum over this normal modes (notice that now the position is just a parameter, no longer an operator):\nE(x, t) =\nX p\n2ħπωn[a+\nn(t) + an(t)]un(x)\nn\nOf course now the electric field is an operator field, that is, it is a QM operator that is defined at each space-time\npoint (x,t).\nNotice that an equivalent formulation of the electric field in a finite volume V is given by defining in a slightly\ndifferent way the un(x) normal modes and writing:\nE(x, t) =\nX r\n2ħπωn [a+\nn(t) + an(t)]un(x).\nV\nn\nWe already have calculated the evolution of the operator a and a+. Each of the operator an evolves in the same way:\nan(t) = an(0)e-iωnt. This derives from the Heisenberg equation of motion dan = i\nħ[\n, an(t)] =\niωnan(t).\ndt\nThe magnetic field can also be expressed in terms of the operators a\nH\n-\nn:\n2πħ\nB(x, t) =\nX\nicn\nr\n[a+\nn -an]\nn\n∇\n)\nωn\n× un(x\nThe strategy has been to use the known forms of the operators for a harmonic oscillator to deduce appropriate\ndh (t)\noperators for the e.m. field. Notice that we could have used the equation\nn\n=\ncfn(t) to eliminate fn and write\ndt\neverything in terms of hn. This would have corresponded to identifying h\n-\nn with position and fn with momentum.\nSince the Hamiltonian is totally symmetric in terms of momentum and position, the results are unchanged and we\ncan choose either formulations. In the case we chose, comparing the way in which the raising and lowering operators\nenter in the E and B expressions with the way they enter the expressions for position and momentum, we may\nsay that, roughly speaking, the electric field is analogous to the position and the magnetic field is analogous to the\nmomentum of an oscillator.\n10.2.1 Zero-Point Energy and the Casimir Force\nThe Hamiltonian operator for the e.m. field has the form of a harmonic oscillator for each mode of the field34. As\nwe saw in a previous lecture, the lowest energy of a h.o. is 1ħω. Since there are infinitely many modes of arbitrarily\nhigh frequency in any finite volume, it follows that there should be an infinite zero-point energy in any volume of\nspace. Needless to say, this conclusion is unsatisfactory. In order to gain some appreciation for the magnitude of\nthe zero-point energy, we can calculate the zero-point energy in a rectangular cavity due to those field modes whose\nfrequency is less than some cutoffωc. The mode functions un(x), solutions of the mode equation for a cavity of\ndimensions Lx × Ly × Lz, have the vector components\nun,α = Aα cos(kn,xrx) sin(kn,yry) sin(kn,zrz)\nfor {α, β, γ} = {\n\nx, y, z} and permutations thereof. The mode un,α(x) are labeled by the wave-vector kn with compo-\nnents:\nnαπ\nkn,α =\n,\nnα\nLα\n∈N\nand the frequency of the mode is ωn =\nk2\nn,x + k2n,y + kn,z. At least two of the integers must be nonzero, otherwise\nthe mode function would vanish identic\nq\nally.\nThe amplitudes of the three components Aα are related by the divergence condition ∇· un(x) = 0, which requires\n\nthat A · k = 0, from which it is clear that there are two linearly independent polarizations (directions of A) for each\n34 See: Leslie E. Ballentine, \"Quantum Mechanics A Modern Development\", World Scientific Publishing (1998). We follow\nhis presentation in this section.\n\nk, and hence there are two independent modes for each set of positive integers (nx, ny, nz). If one of the integers is\nzero, two of the components of u(x) will vanish, so there is only one mode in this exceptional case.\nIn this case the electric field can be written as:\nE(x, t) =\nX\n(Eα + Eα\n+) =\nX\neˆα\nX r\nħωn\n\n[a+ ei(kn·r-ωt) + a ei(kn·r-ωt)\nn\n]\n2o0V\nn\nα=1,2\nα=1,2\nn\nHere V = LxLyLz is the volume of the cavity. Notice that the electric field associated with a single photon of\nfrequency ωn is\nħω\nE\nr\n2π\nn\nn =\nV\nThis energy is a figure of merit for any phenomena relying on atomic interactions with a vacuum field, for example,\ncavity quantum electrodynamics. In fact, En may be estimated by equating the quantum mechanical energy of a\nphoton ħωn with its classical energy 1\ndV (E2 + B2).\nGoing back to the calculation of the en\nR\nergy density, if the dimensions of the cavity are large, the allowed values of k\napproximate a continuum, and the density of modes in the positive octant of k space is ρ(k) = 2V/π3 (the factor 2\ncomes from the two possible polarizations). The zero-point energy density for all modes of frequency less that ωc is\nthen given by\nk\nc 1\n2 1\nE =\nω ≈\nZ\nd3\nħ\nk\nkρ(k) ħω(k)\nV\nV 8\nk=1\nwhere we sum over all positive k (in the firs\nX\nt sum) and multiply by the number of possible polarizations (2). The\nsum is then approximated by an integral over the positive octant (hence the 1/8 factor). Using ω(k) = kc (and\nd3k = 4πk2dk), we obtain\n2 2V 4π\nE0 = V π3 8\nZ kc\nkc\ndk ħk3\ncħ\nħ\nc =\ndkk3\nck4\n=\nc\n2π2\nk=0\nZ\nk=0\n8π2\nwhere we set the cutoffwave-vector kc = ωc/c. The factor k4\nc indicates that this energy density is dominated by\nthe high-frequency, short-wavelength modes. Taking a minimum wavelength of λ\nc = 2π/k = 0.4\n10-m, so as to\ninclude the visible light spectrum, yields a zero-point energy density of 23 J/m3. This may be com\n×\npared with energy\ndensity produced by a 100 W light bulb at a distance of 1 m, which is 2.7\n10-8 J/m3. Of course it is impossible\nto extract any of the zero-point energy, since it is the minimum possible e\n×\nnergy of the field, and so our inability\nto perceive that large energy density is not incompatible with its existence. Indeed, since most experiments detect\nonly energy differences, and not absolute energies, it is often suggested that the troublesome zero-point energy of\nthe field should simply be omitted. One might even think that this energy is only a constant background to every\nexperimental situation, and that, as such, it has no observable consequences. On the contrary, the vacuum energy\nhas direct measurable consequences, among which the Casimir effect is the most prominent one.\nIn 1948 H. B. G. Casimir showed that two electrically neutral, perfectly conducting plates, placed parallel in vacuum,\nmodify the vacuum energy density with respect to the unperturbed vacuum. The energy density varies with the\nseparation between the mirrors and thus constitutes a force between them, which scales with the inverse of the\nforth power of the mirrors separation. The Casimir force is a small but well measurable quantity. It is a remarkable\nmacroscopic manifestation of a quantum effect and it gives the main contribution\nbodies for distances beyond 100nm.\nWe consider a large cavity of dimensions V = L3 bounded by conducting walls\n(see figure). A conducting plate is inserted at a distance R from one of the yz\nfaces (R ≪L). The new boundary condition at x = R alters the energy (or\nfrequency) of each field mode. Following Casimir, we shall calculate the energy\nshift as a function of R. Let WX denote the electromagnetic energy within a\ncavity whose length in the x direction is X. The change in the energy due to the\ninsertion of the plate at x = R will be\n∆W = (WR + WL\nR)\nW\n-\n-\nL\nEach of these three terms is infinite, but the difference will turn out to be finite.\nEach mode has a zero-point energy of 1ħkc. But while we can take the continuous\nto the forces between macroscopic\nWL WR WL-R\nL\nR\nFig. 14: Geometry of Casimir Effect\n\napproximation in calculating WL and WL\nR, for WR we have to keep the discrete\n-\nsum in the x direction (if R is small enough). With some calculations (see Ballentine) we find that the change in\nenergy is\nπ2 L2\n∆W = -ħc720 R3\nWhen varying the position R, an attractive force (minus sign) is created between the conducting plates, equal to\n∂∆W\nπ2 L2\nF = -\n= -ħc\n∂R\n240 R4\nThe force per unit area (pressure) is then P =\nπ\nħc\n4 . This is the so-called Casimir force. This force is very difficult\n240 R\nto measure. The surfaces must be flat and cle\n-\nan, and free from any electrostatic charge. However, there has been\nmeasurements of the Casimir effect, since the experiment by by Sparnaay (1958).\nThe availability of experimental set-ups that allow accurate measurements of surface forces between macroscopic\nobjects at submicron separations has recently stimulated a renewed interest in the Casimir effect and in its possible\napplications to micro- and nanotechnology. The Casimir force is highly versatile and changing materials and shape\nof the boundaries modifies its strength and even its sign. Modifying strength and even sign of the Casimir force has\ngreat potential in providing a means for indirect force transmission in nanoscale machines, which is at present not\nachievable without damaging the components. A contactless method would represent a breakthrough in the future\ndevelopment of nanomachines. More generally, a deeper knowledge of the Casimir force and Casimir torque could\nprovide new insights and design alternatives in the fabrications of micro- and nanoelectromechanical-systems (MEMS\nand NEMS). Another strong motivation comes from the need to make advantage of the unique properties of Carbon\nNanotubes in nanotechnology.\nMeasuring the Casimir force is also important from a fundamental standpoint as it probes the most fundamental\nphysical system, that is, the quantum vacuum. Furthermore, it is a powerful experimental method for providing\nconstraints on the parameters of a Yukawa-type modification to the gravitational interaction or on forces predicted\nby supergravity and string theory.\n\n10.3 Quantization of the e.m. field in the Coulomb gauge\nThe quantization procedure and resulting interactions detailed above may appear quite general, but in fact we made\nan important assumption at the very beginning which will limit their applicability: we considered only the situation\n\nwith no sources, so we implicitly treated only transverse fields where ∇·E = 0. Longitudinal fields result from charge\ndistributions ρ and they do not satisfy a wave equation. By considering only transverse fields, however, we have\nfurther avoided the issue of gauge. Since a transverse electric field ET satisfies the wave equation, we were able to\ndirectly quantize it without intermediate recourse to the vector potential A and thus we never encountered a choice\n\nof gauge. In fact, the procedure can be viewed as corresponding to an implicit choice of gauge φ = 0,\nA = 0 that\ncorresponds to a Lorentz gauge.\n∇·\nA more general approach may use the canonical Hamiltonian for a particle of mass m and charge q in an electro-\nmagnetic field. In this approach, the particle momentum p is replaced by the canonical momentum p\nqA/c, so the\nHamiltonian contains terms like H ∼(p\nqA/c)2/2m. In this case, it is still possible to write a wave eq\n-\nuation for the\npotentials. Then the potential are quant\n-\nized and for an appropriate choice of gauge we find again the same results.\nSpecifically, for an appropriate choice of gauge, the p · A terms imply the dipole interaction E · d that we will use in\nthe following.\nWithin the Coulomb gauge, the vector potential obeys the wave equation\n∂2A\n∂t2 -c2∇2A = 0\nTaking furthermore periodic boundary conditions in a box of volume V = L3 the quantized electromagnetic field in\nthe Heisenberg picture is:\n2πħ\n\nA(t, x) =\nX X r\nh\na\ni(ωkt\nk x)\ni(ωkt\nk x)\nkαe-\n-·\n+ ak\n+ e\neˆα(\nV ω\nα\n-·\nk)\nk\nα=1,2\nk\ni\nThe field can then be written in terms of the potential as E = -∂A and we find the similar result as before:\n∂t\nE(t, x) =\nX X r\n2πħωk h\n\na\ni(ωkt\nk x)\ni(ωkt\nk x)\nkαe-\n-·\na+\nkαe\n-·\neˆα(k)\nV\nα=1,2\nk\n-\ni\nand\nX X r\n2πħωk\nB(t, x) =\nV\nh\n\nakαe-i(ωkt-k·x) -a\ni\n+\nk\n-\nαe (ωkt\nk·x) (k\neˆα(k))\nα=1,2\nk\ni\n×\n10.4 States of the e.m. field\nBecause of the analogies of the e.m. with a set of harmonic oscillators, we can apply the knowledge of the h.o. states\nto describe the states of the e.m. field. Specifically, we will investigate number states and coherent states.\n10.4.1 Photon number eigenstates\nWe can define number states for each mode of the e.m. field. The Hamiltonian for a single mode is given by\nm =\nħωm(a+\nmam + 1) with eigenvectors |nm⟩. The state representing many modes is then given by\nH\n|n1, n2, . . .⟩= |n1⟩⊗|n2⟩⊗· · · = |n⟩\nTherefore the mth mode of this state is described as containing nm photons. These elementary excitations of the e.m.\nfield behave in many respects like particles, carrying energy and momentum. However, the analogy is incomplete,\nand it is not possible to replace the e.m. field by a gas of photons.\n\nIn a state with definite photon numbers, the electric and magnetic fields are indefinite and fluctuating. The probability\ndistributions for the electric and magnetic fields in such a state are analogous to the distributions for the position\nand momentum of an oscillator in an energy eigenstate. Thus we have for the expectation value of the electric field\noperator:\n⟨E(x, t)⟩= ⟨n|\n2ħπωm[a+\nm(t) + am(t)]um(x)\nm\n|n⟩= 0\nHowever, the second moment is non-zero:\nX p\n\n|E(x, t)|2\n= 2πħ\nX √ωpωm\n\n[a+\np(t) + ap(t)][a+\nm(t) + am(t)]\n\nup(x)\n)\np\n· um(x\n,m\n= 2πħ\nωm|um|2 [a+\nm(t) + a (\nm t)]2\n= 2πħ\nωm um\nm\nm\n|\n(x)| (2nm + 1)\nThe sum over all modes is infin\nX\nite. This div\n\nergence problem c\n\nan often\nX\nbe circumvented (but not solved) by recognizing\nthat a particular experiment will effectively couple to the EM field only over some finite bandwidth, thus we can set\ncut-offs on the number of modes considered.\nNotice that we can as well calculate ∆B for the magnetic field, to find the same expression.\n10.4.2 Coherent states\nA coherent state of the e.m. field is obtained by specifying a coherent state for each of the mode oscillators of the\nfield. Thus the coherent state vector will have the form\n|α⟩= |α1α2 . . .⟩= |α1⟩⊗|α2⟩⊗. . .\nIt is parameterized by a denumberably infinite sequence of complex numbers. We now want to calculate the evolution\nof the electric field for a coherent state. In the Heisenberg picture it is:\nE(x, t) =\nX p\nt\nħπω [a+\nm\nmeiω\nm\n+ a\nt\nme-iωm ]um(x)\nm\nthen, taking the expectation value we find:\n⟨E(x, t)⟩=\nX p\n2ħπωm[αm\n∗eiωmt + αme-iωmt]um(x)\nm\nThis is exactly the same form as a normal mode expansion of a classical solution of Maxwell's equations, with the\nparameter αm representing the amplitude of a classical field mode. In spite of this similarity, a coherent state of the\nquantized EM field is not equivalent to a classical field, although it does give the closest possible quantum operator,\nin terms of its expectation value. Even if the average field is equivalent to the classical field, there are still the\ncharacteristic quantum fluctuations. A coherent state provides a good description of the e.m. field produced by a\nlaser. Most ordinary light sources emit states of the e.m. field that are very close to a coherent state (lasers), or to a\nstatistical mixture of coherent states (classical sources).\nA. Fluctuations\nWe calculate the fluctuations for a single mode ∆Em. From\n|Em\nħ\n|2\n= ⟨αm| Em · Em |αm⟩we obtain ∆E2\nm =\n2π ωm|um(x)| . Indeed, from\n\n(am + a+\nm)\nwe obtain:\n\n⟨αm| (am\n+ )2 + a2\nm + a+\nmam + ama+\nm |α\n\nm⟩2πħω|um(x)|2 =\n\n1 + ((α∗\nm)2 + α2\nm + 2α∗\nmαm)\n\n2πħω|um(x)|2\nwhile we have\n\nam + a+\nm\n\n= (αm + α∗\nm)\n√\n2πħωum(x), so that we obtain\n\n(am + a+\nm)2\n-\n\nam + a+\nm\n2 = 2πħωm|um(x)|2\nThis is independent of αm, and is equal to the mean square fluctuation in the ground state. The Heisenberg inequality\nis therefore saturated when the field is in a coherent state,\n\nB. Photon statistics\nThe photon number distribution for each mode in a coherent state is obtained as for the h.o. The probability of\nfinding a total of n photons in the field mode is governed by the Poisson distribution.\nThe probability of finding n photons in the mode m is Pα(nm) = |⟨nm|α⟩|2. Using the expansion of the coherent\nα\n2n\nstate in terms of the number states that we found for the h.o., we obtain Pα(nm) = |\nm|\ne-|αm| . This is a Poisson\nn!\n|\n|\nn n\ndistribution, with parameter α\nm . Thus we have ⟨nm⟩= |αm|2, so that we can rewrite the pdf as P(n) = ⟨⟩e\nn!\n-⟨n⟩.\nFrom the known properties of the Poisson distribution, we also find ∆n2 = n2 -⟨n⟩= ⟨n⟩.\nIn particular we have the well-know shot-noise scaling ∆n = 1/\n\nu\n\np\n⟨n⟩(i.e. the flctuations go to zero when there are\n⟨n⟩\nmany photons.)\n10.4.3 Measurement Statistics\nWe saw in the previous section the photon number distribution for a coherent state. This corresponds to the exper-\nimental situation in which we want to measure the number of photons in a field (such as laser light) which is well\napproximated by a classical field and thus can be represented by a coherent state.\nThis is not the only type of measurement of the e.m. field that we might want to do. Two other common measurement\nmodalities are homodyne and heterodyne detection35.\nHomodyne detection corresponds to the measurement of one quadrature amplitude. In practice, one mixes the e.m.\nfield with a local oscillator at with a fixed frequency ω (same as the field frequency) before collecting the signal with\nFig. 15: Homodyne detection scheme and measurement statistics of the first three photon number eigenstates.\na photon counting detector.\nThus the measurement corresponds to the observable Oho = |α1⟩⟨α1| (or Oho = |α2⟩⟨α2|, depending on the phase of\nthe local oscillator), where |α1,2⟩are the eigenstates of the quadrature operators a1 = 1(a + a+) and a2 = i (a+ -a).\nThe measurement statistics for a number state |m⟩is thus:\n(a+)n\nω\nPm(α1) = |⟨α1|m⟩|2 = ⟨α1|\n|n⟩=\nr\nH2\nm(α1/2)e-α2\n1/ ,\n⟨Oho\nn!\nπ\n⟩=\nħ\n⟨m| Ohe |m⟩= 0,\n⟨∆Oho⟩= 2\nwhere Hn is the nth Hermite polynomial and ⟨∆O⟩=\nq\n⟨O2⟩-⟨O⟩. We note that these results correspond to what\nwe had found for the x operator in the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator.\nHeterodyne detection corresponds to the simultaneous measurement of the two quadratures of a field. Operationally,\none mixes the e.m. field with a local oscillator of frequency ω, modulated at the Intermediate Frequency ωIF ; the\n35 We follow here the presentation in Prof. Yamamoto's Lectures\n(c) Yoshihisa Yamamoto.

Thus the measurement corresponds\nto the observable Ohe = |α⟩⟨α|.

The semi-classical treatment of this interaction, is quite similar: we treat the atom quantum\n\nmechanically and therefore consider d as an operator, but treat the electromagnetic field classically and so consider\nE as a vector. We can write the dipole moment operator as\nd = er =\nX\nk,h\n|k⟩⟨k| d |h⟩⟨h|\nwhere {|k⟩} forms a complete basis. Transitions are only possible between states with different h and k:\ndh,k = ⟨\n\nh| d |k⟩= 0\niif\nk = h\nand we will consider for simplicity a two-level atom:\nd = |\n\n0⟩⟨1|d01 + |1⟩⟨0|d10\n\nLet's first consider a single mode classical electromagnetic field, given by E = Ee-iωt+E∗eiωt. The full semi-classical\n(sc) Hamiltonian is then:\nH\nħ\n| ⟩⟨| -| ⟩⟨| -| ⟩⟨|\n\ni\nsc =\nω0( 1 1\n0 0 )\n( 0 1 d\nωt\n\niωt\n01 + |1⟩⟨0|d10) · (Ee-\n+ E∗e\n)\n\nIf we assume {d10, E} ∈R, we can rewrite this as\nH\n\nsc =\nħ\n\nω0σz\n-2σxd10 · E cos(ωt)\nNotice the correspondence with the spin Hamiltonian Hspin = Ωσz +B cos(ωt)σx describing the interaction of a spin\nwith a time-varying, classical magnetic field.\nWe can now go into the interaction frame defined by the Hamiltonian H0 = 1ω0σz. Then we have:\nH\n= -(|0⟩⟨1|d\neiω0t\n\n+ |\n· (E\n1⟩⟨0|d\ne-iω0t)\ne-iωt\n\nω\nc\n+ E∗ei t\ns\n)\nOn resonance (ω0 = ω) we retain only time-independent contributions to the Hamiltonian (RWA), then\nH sc ≈-(|1⟩⟨0|d E + |0⟩⟨1|d∗E∗)\nAssuming for example that d E is real, we obtain an Hamiltonian -d Eσx, in perfect analogy with the TLS already\nstudied. (A more general choice of d E just gives an Hamiltonian at some angle in the xy plane).\nNow let us consider a full quantum-mechanical treatment of this problem. The interaction between an atom and a\nquantized field appears much the same as the semiclassical interaction. Starting with the dipole Hamiltonian for a\ntwo-level atom, we replace E by the corresponding operator, obtaining the interaction Hamiltonian\nV = -d · E = -\nX\n\n(E\n\nα + Eα\n+\n\n) · (d\nα\n|1⟩⟨0| + d∗|0⟩⟨1|)\nX X r\n2πħω\n\n= -\nm [a+\ni\nk\nme-km·r + a\nm\nmei\n·r](dα\nV\nα\nm\n|1⟩⟨0| + d∗\nα|0⟩⟨1|)\n(where α is the polarization and m the mode). As in the semiclassical analysis, the Hamiltonian contains four terms,\nwhich now have a clearer physical picture:\n\na+\nm|0⟩⟨1|\nAtom decays from |1⟩→|0⟩and emits a photon (in the mth mode).\na |1⟩⟨0|\nAtom is excited from |0⟩→|1⟩and absorbs a photon (from the mth\nm\nmode).\na+\nm|1⟩⟨0|\nAtom is excited from |0⟩→|1⟩and emits a photon (in the mth mode).\nam|0⟩⟨1|\nAtom decays from |1⟩→|0⟩and absorbs a photon (from the mth mode).\nFor photons near resonance with the atomic transition, the first two processes conserve energy; the second two\nprocesses do not conserve energy, and intuition suggests that they may be neglected. In fact, there is a direct\ncorrespondence between the RWA and energy conservation: the second two processes are precisely those fast-rotating\nterms we disregarded previously.\nConsider the total Hamiltonian :\nħ\nH = H0 + V =\nω\nħ\n0σz +\nX\nωm\nm\n\na+\nmam +\n\n+ V\nIf we go to the interaction frame defined by the Hamiltonian\n0, each mode acquires a time dependence e±iωmt while\nthe atom acquires a time dependence e±iω0t:\nH\nX\nE\n\n(\na+ e-\nikm·reiωmt + E∗a eikm r\nm\nm\nm\n·\nm\ne-iωmt) · (e+iω0tdα|1⟩⟨0| + d∗\nαe-iω0at|0⟩⟨1|)\nwhere E\n=\nq\n2πħωm\nm\n. Thus the time-dependent factors acquired are\nV\na+\nm|0⟩⟨1| →a+\nm|0⟩⟨1|e+i(ω0-ωm)t\nam|1⟩⟨0| →am|1⟩⟨0|e-i(ω0-ωm)t\na+\nm|1⟩⟨0| →a+\nm|1⟩⟨0|ei(ω0+ωm)t\nam|0⟩⟨1| →am|0⟩⟨1|e-i(ω0+ωm)t\nFor frequencies ωm near resonance ωm ≈ω0, we only retains the first two terms.\n\nThen, defining the single-photon Rabi frequency, g\n= -d\nħ\nα\nm\nħ\nq\nπ ωm\nr\nα\neikm\n,\n·, the Hamiltonian in the interaction\nV\npicture and in the RWA approximation is\nH =\nX\nħ\ngm,αam|1⟩⟨0| + gm\n∗\n,αa+\nm\nm\n|0⟩⟨1|\n\nFrom now on we assume an e.m. with a single mode (or we assume that only one mode is on resonance). We can\nwrite a general state as |ψ⟩= P\nn αn(t) |1n⟩+ βn(t) |0n⟩, where n = nm is a state of the given mode m we retain\nand here I will call the Rabi frequency for the mode of interest g\n|\n.\n⟩\nThe\n|\nevo\n⟩\nlution is given by:\niħ\nX\n\nα n |1n⟩+ βn |0n⟩= ħ\nX\ng\n\nαnσ a+ |1n⟩+ βnσ+a |0n\n-\nn\nn\n⟩\n\n= ħ\ng αn\n√\nn + 1 |0, n + 1\nn\n⟩+ βn\n√n |1, n -1⟩\nWe then project these equations on\nX\n\n⟨1n| and ⟨0n\n\n|:\niħα n = ħgβn+1(t)\n√\nn + 1\niħ βn = ħgαn-1(t)√n\nto obtain a set of equations:\nα n = -ig√n + 1βn+1\nβn+1 = -ig√n + 1αn\nThis is a closed system of differential equations and we can solve for αn, βn+1.\nWe consider a more general case, where the field-atom are not exactly on resonance. We define ∆= 1(ω0\nω), where\nω = ωm for the mode considered. Then the Hamiltonian is:\n-\nH = ħg a|1⟩⟨0| + g∗a+|0⟩⟨1| + ħ∆(|1⟩⟨1| -|0⟩⟨0|)\n\nWe can assume that initially the atom is in the the excited state |1⟩(that is, βn(0) = 0, ∀n). Then we have:\ni∆t/2\n\nΩnt\ni∆\nαn(t) = αn(0)e\ncos\n-\nsin\nΩn\nΩnt\n\nig√n\nβ\ni∆t/2\n+ 1\nΩnt\nn(t) = -αn(0)e-\n\nsin\nΩn\n\nwith Ω2\nn = ∆2 + 4g2(n + 1). If initially there is no field (i.e. the e.m. field is in the vacuum state) and the atom is in\nthe excited state, then α0(0) = 1, while αn(0) = 0 ∀n = 0. Then there are only two components that are different\nthan zero:\nα\ni∆t/2\nΩ0t\ni∆\nΩ0t\n0(t) = e\n\"\ncos\n\n-\nsin\n∆2 + 4g2\n\n#\n2ig\nΩ0t\nβ0(t) = -e-i∆t/2\np\nsin\n∆2 + 4g2\n\nor on resonance (∆= 0)\np\ngt\n⟨1, n = 0|ψ(t)⟩= α0(t) = cos\n\ngt\n⟨0, n = 0|ψ(t)⟩= β0(t) = -i sin\n\nThus, even in the absence of field, it is possible to make the transition from the ground to the excited state! In the\nsemiclassical case (where the field is treated as classical) we would have no transition at all. These are called Rabi\nvacuum oscillations.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nFall 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

In particular, to analyze the interaction of radiation with matter we will need to develop\napproximation methods36 .\n11.1.1 Non-degenerate case\nWe have an Hamiltonian\nH = H0 + oV\nwhere we know the eigenvalue of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 and we want to solve for the perturbed case\nH = H0 + oV , in terms of an expansion in o (with o varying between 0 and 1). The solution for o → 1 is the desired\nsolution.\nWe assume that we know exactly the energy eigenkets and eigenvalues of H0:\n(0)\nH0 |k) = E\n|k)\nk\nAs H0 is hermitian, its eigenkets form a complete basis L |k)(k| = 1 . We assume at first that the energy spectrum\nk\n(0)\nis not degenerate (that is, all the E\nare different, in the next section we will study the degenerate case). The\nk\neigensystem for the total hamiltonian is then\n(H0 + oV ) |φk)o = Ek(o) |φk )o\nwhere o = 1 is the case we are interested in, but we will solve for a general o as a perturbation in this parameter:\n(0))\n(1))\n(2))\n(0)\n(1)\n(2)\n|φk) =\nφk\n+ o\nφk\n+ o2 φk\n+ . . . ,\nEk = Ek + oEk + o2E\n+ . . .\nk\n36 A very good treatment of perturbation theory is in Sakurai's book -J.J. Sakurai \"Modern Quantum Mechanics\", Addison\nWesley (1994), which we follow here.\n\n(0))\n(0)\nwhere of course φ\n= |k). When o is small, we can in fact approximate the total energy Ek by E\n. The energy\nk\nk\n(0)\nshift due to the perturbation is then only ∆k = Ek -E\nand we can write:\nk\n(0)\n(0)\n(H0 + oV ) |φk) = (E\n+ ∆k) |φk)\n→\n(E\n-H0) |φk ) = (oV -∆k) |φk)\nk\no\nk\nThen, we project onto (k|:\n(0)\n(k| (E\n-H0) |φk) = (k| (oV -∆k) |φk)\nk\n(0)\nThe LHS is zero since (k| H0 |φk) = (k| E\n|φk), and from the RHS (k| (oV -∆k) |φk) = 0 we obtain:\nk\n(k| V |φk)\n∆k = o\n→\n∆k = o(k| V |φk)\n(k|φk)\nwhere we set (k|φk) = 1 (a non-canonical normalization, although, as we will see, it is approximately valid).\nUsing the expansion above, we can replace ∆k by oE1 + o2E2 + . . . and |φk ) by its expansion:\nk\nk\n(1)\n(2)\noEk\n1 + o2Ek\n2 + · · · = o (k| V (|k) + o φ\n)\n+ o2 φ\n)\n+ . . . )\nk\nk\nand equating terms of the same order in o we obtain:\n(n-1))\nEn = (k| V φ\nk\nk\nThis is a recipe to find the energy at all orders based only on the knowledge of the eigenstates of lower orders.\n(n-1))\n?\nHowever, the question still remains: how do we find φk\nWe could think of solving the equation:\n(0)\n(E\n-H0) |φk) = (oV -∆k) |φk)\n(∗)\nk\n(0)\nfor |φk), by inverting the operator (E\n-H0) and again doing an expansion of |φk) to equate terms of the same\nk\norder:\n|k) + o φ(1))\n+ · · · = (E(0) -H0)-1(oV -∆k)(|k) + o φ(1))\n+ . . . )\nk\nk\nk\nUnfortunately this promising approach is not correct, since the operator (E(0) -H0)-1 is not always well defined.\nk\n(0)\n(0)\nSpecifically, there is a singularity for (E\n-H0)-1 |k). What we need is to make sure that (E\n-H0)-1 is never\nk\nk\napplied to eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, that is, we need |ψk) = (oV -∆k ) |φk)\n|k) for any |φk).\n=\nWe thus define the projector Pk = 1 -|k) (k| = L\n|h) (h|. Then we can ensure that ∀|ψ) the projected state\nh =k\n|ψ)′ = Pk |ψ) is such that (k|ψ ′ ) = 0 since this is equal to\n(k| Pk|ψ) = (k|ψ) -(k|k)(k|ψ) = 0\n(0)\nNow, using the projector, (E\n-H0)-1Pk|ψ) is well defined. We then take the equation (∗) and multiply it by Pk\nk\nfrom the left:\n(0)\nPk(E\n-H0) |φk) = Pk(oV -∆k) |φk) .\nk\n(0)\n(0)\nSince Pk commutes with H0 (as |k) is an eigenstate of H0) we have Pk(E\n-H0) |φk) = (E\n-H0)Pk |φk) and we\nk\nk\ncan rewrite the equation as\n(0)\nPk |φk) = (E\n-H0)-1Pk(oV -∆k) |φk)\nk\nWe can further simplify this expression, noting that Pk |φk) = |φk) -|k)(k|φk ) = |φk) -|k) (since we adopted the\nnormalization (k|φk) = 1). Finally we obtain:\n(0)\n|φk) = |k) + (E\n-H0)-1Pk (oV -∆k) |φk)\n(∗∗)\nk\n\nThis equation is now ready to be solved by using the perturbation expansion. To simplify the expression, we define\nthe operator Rk\n(0)\n|h) (h|\nRk = (E\n-H0)-1Pk =\nL\nk\nE0 -E0\nh=k\nk\nh\nNow using the expansion\n(1)\n(1)\n|k) + o|φ\n) + · · · = |k) + Rko(V -Ek\n1 -oEk\n2 -. . . )(|k) + o|φ\n) + . . . )\nk\nk\nwe can solve term by term to obtain:\n1st\n(1)\norder:\n|φ\n) = Rk(V -Ek\n1) |k) = Rk(V -(k| V |k)) |k) = RkV |k)\nk\n(where we used the expression for the first order energy and the fact that Rk |k) = 0 by definition).\nWe can now calculate the second order energy, since we know the first order eigenstate:\n\n(1)\n|h) (h|\nE2\nk = (k|V |φk ) = (k| V RkV |k) = (k| V L\nV |k)\nE0 -E0\nk\nh\nh=k\nor explicitly\nE2\nL |Vkh|2\n=\nk\nE0 -E0\nh=k\nk\nh\nThen the second order eigenstate is\n2nd order:\nφ2\n= RkV RkV |k)\nk\nA. Formal Solution\nWe can also find a more formal expression that can yield the solution to all orders. We rewrite Eq. (**) using Rk\nand obtain\n|φk) = |k) + Rk(oV -∆k) |φk) = RkH1 |φk)\nwhere we defined H1 = (oV -∆k). Then by iteration we can write:\n|φk) = |k) + RkH1 (|k) + RkH1 |φk)) = |k) + RkH1 |k) + RkH1RkH1 |φk)\nand in general:\n|φk) = |k) + RkH1 |k) + RkH1RkH1 |k) + · · · + (RkH1)n |k) + . . .\nThis is just a geometric series, with formal solution:\n|φk) = (1 -RkH1)-1 |k)\nB. Normalization\nIn deriving the TIPT we introduced a non-canonical normalization (k|φk) = 1, which implies that the perturbed\nstate |φk ) is not normalized. We can then define a properly normalized state as\n|φk)\n|ψk) = v\n(φk|φk )\nso that (k|ψk) = 1/\nv\n(φk|φk ). We can calculate perturbatively the normalization factor (φk |φk):\n✟\n|Vkh|2\n(φk|φk) = (k + oφ1\n. . .|k + oφ1 + . . .) = 1 + o(k|φ1\nk |φ1\n.. = 1 + o2 L\nk +\n✟✟k) + .. + o2(φ1\nk) +\n(E0 -E0)2\nh\nk\nh=k\nNotice that the state is correctly normalized up to the second order in o.\n\nC. Anti-crossing\nConsider two levels, h and k with energies E0 and E0 and assume that we apply a perturbation V which connects\nk\nh\nonly these two states (that is, V is such that (l| V |j) = 0 and it is different than zero only for the transition from h\nto k: (h| V |k) = 0.)\nIf the perturbation is small, we can ask what are the perturbed state energies.\nThe first order is zero by the choice of V , then we can calculate the second order:\n(2)\nL |Vkj |2\n|Vkh|2\nE\n=\n=\nk\nE0 -E0\nE0 -E0\nj=k\nk\nj\nk\nh\nand similarly\n(2)\nL |Vhj |2\n|Vkh|2\n(2)\nE\n=\n=\n= -E\n.\nh\nE0 -E0\nE0 -E0\nk\nj=h\nh\nj\nh\nk\nThis opposite energy shift will be more important (more noticeable) when the energies of the two levels E0 and\nk\nE0 are close to each other. Indeed, in the absence of the perturbation, the two energy levels would \"cross\" when\nh\nE0 = E0 . If we add the perturbation, however, the two levels are repelled with opposite energy shifts. We describe\nk\nh\nwhat is happening as an \"anti-crossing\" of the levels: even as the levels become connected by an interaction, the levels\nnever meet (never have the same energy) since each level gets shifted by the same amount in opposite directions.\nD. Example: TLS energy splitting from perturbation\nConsider the Hamiltonian H = ωσz + oΩσx. For o = 0 the eigenstates are |k) = {|0), |1)} and eigenvalues E0 = ±ω.\nk\nWe also know how to solve exactly this simple problem by diagonalizing the entire matrix:\nE1,2 = ±\nv\nω2 + o2Ω2 ,\n|φ1) = cos(θ/2)|0) + sin(θ/2)|1),\n|φ2) = cos(θ/2)|1) -sin(θ/2)|0)\nwith\nθ = arctan(oΩ/ω)\nFor o ≪ 1 we can expand in series these results to find:\no2Ω2\nE1,2 ≈±(ω +\n+ . . . )\n2ω\nθ\noΩ\nθ\noΩ\n|φ1) ≈|0) +\n|1) = |0) +\n|1)\n|φ2) ≈|1) -\n|0) = |1) -\n|0)\n2ω\n2ω\nAs an exercise, we can find as well the results of TIPT. First we find that the first order energy shift is zero, since\nE1 = (k| V |k) = (0|(Ωσx)|0) = 0 (and same for (1|(Ωσx)|1)). Then we can calculate the first order eigenstate:\nk\nΩ\nφ1\n= |0) + (E1\n0 -H0)-1P1V |0) = |0) + [ω(1 -σz )]-1|1)(1|oΩσx|0) = |0) +\noΩ|1)(1|σx|0) = |0) + o\n|1)\n2ω\n2ω\nφ1\n|V12 |2\n(oΩ)2\nsimilarly, we find\n= |1) -o Ω |0). Finally, the second order energy shift is E1\n2 =\n=\nin agreement\n2ω\nE0-E0\n2ω\nwith the result from the series expansion.\nWe can also look at the level anti-crossing: If we vary the energy ω around zero, the two energy levels cross each\nother.\n\nEigenvalues\nΩ\nFig. 18: Level anticrossing: Eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H = ωσz + oΩσx as a function of ω.

Red\nlines: Ω 6\n0 showing the anticrossing.\n=\n11.1.2 Degenerate case\nIf there are degenerate (or quasi-degenerate) eigenvalues of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0, the expansion used\nabove is no longer valid. There are two problems:\n1. If |k ′ ), |k ′′ ), ... have the same eigenvalue, we can choose any combination of them as the unperturbed eigenket.\nBut then, if we were to find the perturbed eigenket |ψk), to which state would this go to when o → 0?\n2. The term Rk =\n(0)\nPk\ncan be singular for the degenerate eigenvalues.\nEk\n-H0\nAssume there is a d-fold degeneracy of the eigenvalue Ed, with the unperturbed eigenkets {|ki)} forming a subspace\nHd. We can then define the projectors Qd = L\n|ki)(ki| and Pd = 1 -Qd. These projectors also define subspaces\nki∈Hd\nof the total Hilbert space H that we will call Hd (spanned by Qd) and Hd (spanned by Pd).\nNotice that because of their nature of projectors, we have the following identities:\nP 2 = Pd,\nQ2 = Qd,\nPdQd = QdPd = 0\nand\nPd + Qd = 1 .\nd\nd\nWe then rewrite the eigenvalue equation as:\n(H0 + oV ) |φk) = Ek |φk )\n→\nH0(Qd + Pd) |φk) + oV (Qd + Pd) |φk) = Ek(Qd + Pd) |φk)\n→ (Qd + Pd)H0 |φk ) + oV (Qd + Pd) |φk) = Ek (Qd + Pd) |φk)\nwhere we used the fact that [H0, Qd] = [H0, Pd] = 0 since the projectors are diagonal in the Hamiltonian basis. We\nthen multiply from the left by Qd and Pd, obtaining 2 equations:\n1.\nPd × [(Qd + Pd)H0 |φk ) + oV (Qd + Pd) |φk)] = Pd × (Ek(Qd + Pd) |φk))\n→\nH0Pd |φk ) + oPdV (Qd + Pd) |φk) = Ek Pd |φk )\n2.\nQd × [(Qd + Pd)H0 |φk ) + oV (Qd + Pd) |φk)] = Qd × (Ek (Qd + Pd) |φk))\n→\nH0Qd |φk) + oQdV (Qd + Pd) |φk ) = EkQd |φk)\nand we simplify the notation by setting |ψk) = Pd |φk) and |χk) = Qd |φk)\nH0 |ψk) + oPdV (|χk) + |ψk)) = Ek |ψk)\nH0 |χk) + oQdV (|χk) + |ψk)) = Ek |χk)\n\nwhich gives a set of coupled equations in |ψk) and |χk):\n1.\noPdV |χk) = (Ek -H0 -oPdV Pd) |ψk)\n2.\noQdV |ψk) = (Ek -H0 -oQdV Qd) |χk)\nNow (Ek -H0 -oPdV Pd)-1 is finally well defined in the Pd subspace, so that we can solve for |ψk) from (1.):\n|ψk) = oPd(Ek -H0 -oPdV Pd)-1PdV |χk)\nand by inserting this in (2.) we find\n(Ek -H0 -oQdV Qd) |χk) = o2QdV Pd(Ek -H0 -oPdV Pd)-1PdV |χk) .\nIf we keep only the first order in o in this equation we have:\n[(Ek -Ed) -oQdV Qd] |χk) = 0\nwhich is an equation defined on the subspace Hd only.\nWe now call Ud = QdV Qd the perturbation Hamiltonian in the Hd space and ∆k = (Ek -Ed)1 d, to get:\n(∆k -oUd) |χk) = 0\nOften it is possible to just diagonalize Ud (if the degenerate subspace is small enough, for example for a simple double\ndegeneracy) and notice that of course ∆k is already diagonal. Otherwise one can apply perturbation theory to this\n(0)\n(0)\n(0))\n)\n)\nsubspace. Then we will have found some (exact or approximate) eigenstates of Ud, k\n, s.t. Ud k\n= ui k\ni\ni\ni\n(0))\n(0))\nand H0 k\n= Ed k\n, ∀i. Thus, this step sets what unperturbed eigenstates we should choose in the degenerate\ni\ni\nsubspace, hence solving the first issue of degenerate perturbation theory.\nWe now want to look at terms ∝ o2 in\n✘\n(Ek -H0 -oUd) |χk) =\noPdV Pd)-1PdV |χk)\no2QdV Pd(Ek -H0 -✘✘✘\nwhere we neglected terms higher than second order. Rearranging the terms, we have:\nEk |χk) = [H0 + oUd + o2QdV Pd(Ek -H0)-1PdV ] |χk)\n→\n(H 0 + V ) |χk) = Ek |χk)\nwith\nH 0 = H0 + oUd\nV = oQdV Pd(Ek -H0)-1PdV Qd\n)\nIf there are no degeneracies left in H 0, we can solve this problem by TIPT and find χ(n) .\nk\nFor example, to first order, we have\n\nk(0)|\n(0))\nV |k\nj\ni\n(1))\n(0))\nχ\n=\nL\nk\nk,i\nj\nj=i\no(ui -uj )\n(0)\n(0)\nand using the explicit form of the matrix element V ij = (kj |V |k\n),\ni\n\nk(0) V |h) (h| V k(0))\nj\ni\nV ij =\n\nk(0) o2V Pd(Ed\n0 -H0)-1PdV k(0))\n= o2 L\nj\ni\n(0)\n(0)\nE\n-E\nh/∈Hd\nd\nh\nwe obtain:\n(0)\n(0)\n(1)\n(kj |V |h) (h| V |k\n)\n(0)\n)\ni\n)\nχ\n= o\nL\nk\nk,i\n(0)\n(0)\nj\n(ui -uj ) E\n-E\nj=i\nd\nh\n\nFinally, we need to add |χ) and |ψ) to find the total vector:\nφ(1)\n=\nL\n)\nExample: Degenerate TLS\nConsider the Hamiltonian H = ωσz + oΩσx. We already solved this Hamiltonian, both directly and with TIPT.\nNow consider the case ω ≈ 0 and a slightly modified Hamiltonian:\nH = (ω0 + ω)|0)(0| + (ω0 -ω)|1)(1| + oΩσx = ω01 + ωσz + oΩσx.\nWe could solve exactly the system for ω = 0, simply finding E0,1 = ω0 ± oΩ and |φ)0,1 = |±) = √ (|0) ± |1)). We\ncan also apply TIPT.\nHowever the two eigenstates |0), |1) are (quasi-)degenerate thus we need to apply degenerate perturbation theory. In\nparticular, any basis arising from a rotation of these two basis states could be a priori a good basis, so we need first\nto obtain the correct zeroth order eigenvectors. In this very simple case we have Hd = H (the total Hilbert space)\nand H = 0, or in other words, Qd = 1 , Pd = 0. We first need to define an equation in the degenerate subspace only:\nd\n(∆k -oUd) |χk) = 0\nwhere Ud = QdV Qd. Here we have: Ud = V = Ωσx. Thus we obtain the correct zeroth order eigenvectors from\ndiagonalizing this Hamiltonian. Not surprisingly, they are:\n\n(0)\n(0)\nk\nV |h)\nk\n(0)\n(h| V |ki) |h) + o\nL\nj\nk\n) (h| V\ni\nE0\n(0)\n(ui -uj )\nj\n(0)\n(0)\n-E\nE\nd\nh\nj=i\nd\n)\nk\n-Eh\nh/∈Hd\n\n)\n(0)\n(k\n|V |h)\nj\n|h) + o\nL\n(ui -\nj=i\n)\nL\n(h| V |ki)\n(0)\nE0\n(1)\n(0)\nφ\nk\n=\nj\nk\nuj )\n-E\nd\nh\nh/∈Hd\nφ(0)\n0,1\n)\n=\n|±) = √ (|0) ± |1)).\nwith eigenvalues: E0,1 = ω0 ± oΩ. We can now consider higher orders, from the equation:\n\n(H0 + V ) |χk) = Ek |χk)\nwith H 0 = ω01 + oΩσx and V = 0. Thus in this case, there are no higher orders and we solved the problem.\nExample: Spin-1 system\nWe consider a spin-1 system (that is, a spin system with S=1 defined in a 3-dimensional Hilbert space). The matrix\nrepresentation for the angular momentum operators Sx and Sz in this Hilbert space are:\n\n,\nSz =\n\n√\nSx =\n-1\nThe Hamiltonian of the system is H = H0 + oV with\n= ∆S2;\nV = Sx + Sz\nH0\nz\nGiven that\nS2\nz\n\n=\n\nD\n\nThe matrix representation of the total Hamiltonian is :\no\n∆ + o\n√\no\no\n√\n√\nH =\n\no\n√\n∆ -o\nPossible eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are |+1) , |0), |-1):\n\n,\n|+1)\n|0)\n|-1)\n=\n=\n=\n,\n,\nand |-1) is a valid eigenstate, for example\n\nwith energies +∆, 0, +∆ respectively. However, any combination of |+1)\nwe could have chosen:\n\n√\n√\n|+1)\n|-1)\n=\n=\n,\n-1\nThis is the case because the two eigenstates are degenerate. So how do we choose which are the correct eigenstates\nto zeroth order37? We need to first consider the total Hamiltonian in the degenerate subspace.\nThe degenerate subspace is the subspace of the total Hilbert space H spanned by the basis |+1) , |-1); we can call\nthis subspace HQ. We can obtain the Hamiltonian in this subspace by using the projector operator Q: HQ = QHQ,\nwith Q = |+1)(+1| + |-1)(-1| = S2 . Then:\nz\nHQ = Q(∆S2 + o(Sz + Sx))Q = ∆S2 + oSz\nz\nz\n(Notice this can be obtained by direct matrix multiplication or multiplying the operators). In matrix form:\nHQ =\n\n→HQ =\n(\n∆ + o\n∆ -o\n)\n∆ + o 0\n∆ -o\nwhere in the last line I represented the matrix in the 2-dimensional subpsace HQ. We can now easily see that the\ncorrect eigenvectors for the unperturbed Hamiltonian were the original |+1) and |-1) after all. From the Hamiltonian\nin the HQ subspace we can also calculate the first order correction to the energy for the states in the degenerate\n(1)\n(0)\n(1)\n(0)\nsubspace. These are just E\n-E\n+o and E\n-E\n-o.\n+1\n+1 =\n-1\n-1 =\n(1)\nNow we want to calculate the first order correction to the eigenstates |±1). This will have two contributions: |ψ)\n=\n±1\n(1)\n(1)\nQ|ψ)±1 + P |ψ)\nwhere P = 1 -Q = |0) (0| is the complementary projector to Q. We first calculate the first term\n±1\nin the following way. We redefine an unperturbed Hamiltonian in the subspace HQ:\nH 0 = HQ = QHQ = ∆S2 + oSz\nz\nand the perturbation in the same subspace is (following Sakurai):\no\nV = VQ = oQ(V P (∆ -H0)-1PV )Q = oQ\n(Sz + Sx) |0) (0| (∆ |0) (0|)-1 |0) (0| (Sz + Sx)\n\nQ =\nQSxPSxQ\n∆\nIn matrix form:\n\n→\no (\n)\no\no\nVQ =\nVQ =\n=\n(1 + σx)\n2∆\n2∆\n2∆\nNow the perturbed eigenstates can be calculated as:\nL\n(h| VQ |k)\n(1)\n(1)\nQ|ψ)\n= |k) + o\nk\n|h)\n(1)\nE\n-E\nh∈HQ=k\nk\nh\n37 Here by correct eigenstates I means the eigenstates to which the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian will tend to when\no → 0\n\nIn our case:\n(1)\n(-1| VQ |+1)\no (-1| (11 + σx) |+1)\no\nQ|ψ)\n|+1) + o\n|-1) = |+1) + o\n|-1) = |+1) +\n|-1) ,\n+1 =\nE(1) -E(1)\n2∆\n2o\n4∆\n+1\n-1\no\n(1)\nQψ-1 = |-1) -\n|1)\n4∆\n(1)\nIn order to calculate Pψ\nwe can just use the usual formula for non-degenerate perturbation theory, but summing\n±1\nonly over the states outside HQ.

Depending\non the hydrogen's state, we will need to use TIPT or degenerate TIPT, to find either a quadratic or linear (in the\nfield) shift of the energy. The shift in energy is usually called Stark shift or Stark effect and it is the electric analogue\nof the Zeeman effect, where the energy level is split into several components due to the presence of a magnetic field.\nMeasurements of the Stark effect under high field strengths confirmed the correctness of the quantum theory over\nthe Bohr model.\nSuppose that a hydrogen atom is subject to a uniform external electric field, of magnitude |E|, directed along the\nz-axis. The Hamiltonian of the system can be split into two parts. Namely, the unperturbed Hamiltonian,\np\ne\nH0 =\n-\n,\n2 me\n4π o0 r\n38 This section follows Prof. Fitzpatrick online lectures\n\nand the perturbing Hamiltonian\nH1 = e |E| z.\nNote that the electron spin is irrelevant to this problem (since the spin operators all commute with H1), so we can\nignore the spin degrees of freedom of the system. Hence, the energy eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are\ncharacterized by three quantum numbers-the radial quantum number n, and the two angular quantum numbers l\nand m. Let us denote these states as the |nlm), and let their corresponding energy eigenvalues be the Enlm. We use\nTIPT to calculate the energy shift to first and second order.\nA. The quadratic Stark effect\nWe first want to study the problem using non-degenerate perturbation theory, thus assuming that the unperturbed\nstates are non-degenerate. According to TIPT, the change in energy of the eigenstate characterized by the quantum\nnumbers n, l, m in the presence of a small electric field is given by\n|(n, l, m|z|n ′ , l ′ , m ′ )|2\n∆Enlm = e |E| (n, l, m|z|n, l, m) + e 2 |E|2\nL\n.\nEnlm -En ′ l′ m ′\nn ′ ,l′ ,m ′ =n,l,m\nThis energy-shift is known as the Stark effect. The sum on the right-hand side of the above equation seems very\ncomplicated. However, it turns out that most of the terms in this sum are zero. This follows because the matrix\n′\nelements (n, l, m|z|n ′ , l ′ , m ′ ) are zero for virtually all choices of the two sets of quantum number n, l, m and n ′ , l ′ , m .\nLet us try to find a set of rules which determine when these matrix elements are non-zero. These rules are usually\nreferred to as the selection rules for the problem in hand.\nNow, since [Lz, z] = 0, it follows that\n(n, l, m|[Lz, z]|n ′ , l ′ , m ′ ) = (n, l, m|Lz z -z Lz|n ′ , l ′ , m ′ ) = l (m -m ′ ) (n, l, m|z|n ′ , l ′ , m ′ ) = 0.\nHence, one of the selection rules is that the matrix element (n, l, m|z|n ′ , l ′ , m ′ ) is zero unless\n′\nm = m.\nThe selection rule for l can be similarly calculated from properties of the total angular momentum L2 and its\ncommutator with z. We obtain that the matrix element is zero unless\nl ′ = l ± 1.\nApplication of these selection rules to the perturbation equation shows that the linear (first order) term is zero, while\nthe second order term yields\nL\n|(n, l, m|z|n ′ , l ′ , m)|2\n∆Enlm = e 2 |E|2\n.\nEnlm -En ′ l′ m\nn ′ ,l′ =l±1\nOnly those terms which vary quadratically with the field-strength have survived. Hence, this type of energy-shift of\nan atomic state in the presence of a small electric field is known as the quadratic Stark effect.\nNow, the electric polarizability of an atom is defined in terms of the energy-shift of the atomic state as follows:\n∆E = -\nα |E|2 .\nHence, we can write\nL\n|(n, l, m|z|n ′ , l ′ , m)|2\nαnlm = 2 e 2\n.\nEn ′ l′ m -Enlm\nn ′ ,l′ =l±1\nAlthough written for a general state, the equations above assume there is no degeneracy of the unperturbed eigen\nvalues. However, the unperturbed eigenstates of a hydrogen atom have energies which only depend on the radial\nquantum number n, thus they have high (and increasing with n) order of degeneracy. We can then only apply the\nabove results to the n = 1 eigenstate (since for n ≥ 1 there will be coupling to degenerate eigenstates with the same\n\nvalue of n but different values of l). Thus, according to non-degenerate perturbation theory, the polarizability of the\nground-state (i.e., n = 1) of a hydrogen atom is given by\n2 L |(1, 0, 0|z|n, 1, 0)|2\nα = 2 e\n.\nEn -E1\nn>1\nHere, we have made use of the fact that En10 = En00 = En.\nThe sum in the above expression can be evaluated approximately by noting that\ne\nEn = -\n,\n8π o0 a0 n2\n4π o0 ~2\nwhere a0 =\nis the Bohr radius. Hence, we can write\nme e2\ne\nEn -E1 ≥ E2 -E1 =\n,\n8π o0 a0\nwhich implies that the polarizability is\nα <\n4π o0 a0\nL\n|(1, 0, 0|z|n, 1, 0)|2 .\nn>1\nHowever, thanks to the selection rules we have, L\n|(1, 0, 0|z|n, 1, 0)|2 = (1, 0, 0|z2|1, 0, 0) =\n(1, 0, 0|r2|1, 0, 0),\nn>1\nwhere we have made use of the fact the the ground-state of hydrogen is spherically symmetric. Finally, from\n(1, 0, 0|r2|1, 0, 0) = 3 a0 we conclude that\nα <\n4π o0 a0 ≃5.3 4π o0 a .\nThe exact result (which can be obtained by solving Schrdinger's equation in parabolic coordinates) is\nα =\n4π o0 a0 = 4.5 4π o0 a .\nB. The linear Stark effect\nWe now examine the effect of an electric field on the excited energy levels n ≥ 1 of a hydrogen atom. For instance,\nconsider the n = 2 states. There is a single l = 0 state, usually referred to as 2s, and three l = 1 states (with\nm = -1, 0, 1 ), usually referred to as 2p. All of these states possess the same energy, E2 = -e2/(32πo0a0). Because\nof the degeneracy, the treatment above is no longer valid and in order to apply perturbation theory, we have to recur\nto degenerate perturbation theory.\nWe first need to Ud = QdV Qd, where Qd is the projector obtained from the degenerate 2s and 2p states (that is, the\noperator that project into the degenerate subspace). This operator is,\n\n(2, 0, 0|z|2, 1, 0)\nUd = e |E| (2, 1, 0|z|2, 0, 0)\n→\n(\n(2, 0, 0|z|2, 1, 0)\n)\n,\n\n(2, 1, 0|z|2, 0, 0)\nwhere the rows and columns correspond to the |2, 0, 0), |2, 1, 0), |2, 1, 1) and |2, 1, -1) states, respectively and in the\nsecond step we reduce the operator to the degenerate subspace only. To simplify the matrix we used the selection\nrules, which tell us that the matrix element of between two hydrogen atom states is zero unless the states possess the\nsame n quantum number, and l quantum numbers which differ by unity. It is easily demonstrated, from the exact\nforms of the 2s and 2p wave-functions, that\n(2, 0, 0|z|2, 1, 0) = (2, 1, 0|z|2, 0, 0) = 3 a0.\n\nIt can be seen, by inspection, that the eigenvalues of Ud are u1 = 3 e a0 |E|, u2 = -3 e a0 |E|, with corresponding\neigenvectors\n(0) )\n|2, 0, 0) + |2, 1, 0)\n1 (\n)\nk1\n=\n√\n= √\n,\n(0) )\n|2, 0, 0) -|2, 1, 0)\n1 (\n)\nk2\n=\n√\n= √\n-1\nIn the absence of an electric field, all of these states possess the same energy, E2. The first-order energy shifts induced\nby an electric field are given by\n∆E1\n=\n+3 e a0 |E|,\n∆E2\n=\n-3 e a0 |E|,\nThus, the energies of states 1 and 2 are shifted upwards and downwards, respectively, by an amount 3 e a0 |E| in the\npresence of an electric field. States 1 and 2 are orthogonal linear combinations of the original 2s and 2p(m=0) states.\nNote that the energy shifts are linear in the electric field-strength, so this is a much larger effect that the quadratic\neffect described in the previous section.\nThe energies of states 2p(m=1) and 2p(m=-1) (which are outside the degenerate subspace) are not affected to first\norder (as we already saw above for the non-degenerate case). Of course, to second-order the energies of these states are\nshifted by an amount which depends on the square of the electric field-strength, the quadratic shift found previously.\nNote that the linear Stark effect depends crucially on the degeneracy of the 2s and 2p states. This degeneracy is a\nspecial property of a pure Coulomb potential, and, therefore, only applies to a hydrogen atom. Thus, alkali metal\natoms do not exhibit the linear Stark effect.\n\n11.2 Time-dependent perturbation theory\n11.2.1 Review of interaction picture\nWhen first studying the time evolution of QM systems, one approach was to separate the Hamiltonian much in the\nsame way we did above for TIPT. We wrote (see Section 5.2):\nH = H0 + V (t)\nwhere H0 is a \"solvable\" Hamiltonian of which we already know the eigen-decomposition,\nH0|k) = Ek\n0|k),\n-iH0t)\n(so that it is easy to calculate e.g. U0 = e\nand V (t) is a perturbation that drives an interesting (although\nunknown) dynamics. Here we even allow for the possibility that V is time-dependent. For any state |ψ) = L\nk ck(0)|k)\n-iE0\nthe evolution can be written as |ψ) = L\nk ck(t)e\nkt|k). This correspond to explicitly writing down the evolution due\nto the known Hamiltonian (if H = H0 then we would have ck(t) = ck(0) and the evolution would be given by only the\nphase factors). In other words, if we want to compare the state evolution with the initial eigenstates, by calculating\nthe overlap |(k|ψ(t))|2, we would be really interested only in the dynamics driven by V since |(k|ψ(t))|2 = |ck(t)|2\n(while E0 do not play a role).\nk\nWe define states in the interaction picture by\n|ψ)I = U0(t)+|ψ) = e iH0 t|ψ)\nSimilarly we define the corresponding interaction picture operators as:\nAI (t) = U +\n0AU0 → VI (t) = U +\n0V U0\nWe can now derive the differential equation governing the evolution of the state in the interaction picture, starting\nfrom Schr odinger equation.\ni ∂|ψ)I\n∂t\n= i ∂(U +\n0|ψ))\n∂t\n+\n∂|ψ)\n∂t\n∂U\n+\n0 |ψ) + U\ni(\n)\n=\n∂t\nInserting ∂tU0 = iH0U0 and i∂t|ψ) = H0|ψ), we obtain\ni ∂|ψ)\n∂t = U +\n0H0|ψ) -U +\n+\n(H0 + V )|ψ)\nV |ψ).\nU\n=\nInserting the identity 1 = U0U +\n0, we obtain = U +\n0V U0U +\n0|ψ)= VI |ψ)I :\n∂|ψ)I\ni\n= VI (t)|ψ)I\n∂t\nThis is a Schr odinger -like equation for the vector in the interaction picture, evolving under the action of the operator\nVI (t) only.\n11.2.2 Dyson series\nBesides expressing the Schr odinger equation in the interaction picture, we can also write the equation for the prop\nagator that describes the evolution of the state:\nd UI = -iVI UI ,\n|ψ(t)) = UI (t) |ψI (0))\nI\nd t\n\nSince VI (t) is time-dependent, we can only write formal solutions for UI . One expression is given by the Dyson series.\nThe differential equation is equivalent to the integral equation\nt\nUI (t) = 1 -i\nVI (t ′ )UI (t ′ )dt ′\nBy iterating, we can find a formal solution to this equation :\n′\nt\nt\nt\nUI (t) = 1 -i\ndt ′ VI (t ′ ) + (-i)2\ndt ′\ndt ′ VI (t ′ )VI (t ′′ ) + . . .\n(n-1)\nt\nt\n+(-i)n\ndt ′ . . .\ndt(n)VI (t ′ ) . . . VI (t(n)) + . . .\nThis is the Dyson series.\n11.2.3 Fermi's Golden Rule\nThe problem that we try to solve via TDPT is to calculate the transition probability from an initial state to a final\nstate. Consider an initial state |i) which is an eigenstate of H0 (H0 |i) = Ei |i)). Then in the interaction picture we\nhave the evolution\n|i(t)) = UI (t) |i) =\nL\nck(t)|k),\nwith\nck(t) = (k| UI (t) |i)\nI\nk\nWe can insert the perturbation expansion for UI (t) to obtain an expansion for ck(t):\n′\nt\n\nt\nt\nt\n\n′′ ) +\nck(t) = (k| 1 -i\nVI (t ′ )UI (t ′ )dt ′ |i) = (k|\n1 -i\ndt ′ VI (t ′ ) + (-i)2\ndt ′\ndt ′ VI (t ′ )VI (t\n. . .\n|i)\nIn the expansion we will obtain terms such as (k| VI (t) |i) that we can simplify since:\n(k| VI (t) |i) = (k| (U0\n+V (t)U0) |i) = (U0k| V (t) |U0i) = (k| e iωktV (t)e -iωit |i) = (k| V |i) e iωkit = Vki(t)e iωkit\nwhere we defined ωj = Ej /l and ωki = ωk -ωi. Using these relationships and the series expansion we obtain:\n(0)\nc\n(t) = (k|1 |i) = δki\nk\n′\n(1)\niωkit\nc\n(t) = -i\nJ t(k|VI (t ′ ) |i) dt ′ = -i\nJ t Vki(t ′ )e\ndt ′\nk\n′\n′\n′′\n(2)\nc\n(t) = -\nJ t dt ′ J t dt ′′ Vkh(t ′ )Vhi(t ′′ )eiωkht eiωhit\nk\nFrom this expansion we can calculate the transition probability as P (i → k) = |ck(t)|2 .\nWe first consider the case where the perturbation V is time-independent and it is turned on at the time t = 0. Then\nwe have\nt\niωkit\niωkit)\n(1)\nVki\nVki\n( ωkit )\nck (t) = -iVki\ne\n′ dt ′ =\n(1 -e\n= -2i\ne iωkit/2 sin\nωki\nωki\nThen to first order perturbation, the transition probability is\n4|Vki|2\n( ωkit )\nP (i → k) =\nsin2\nω2\nki\nWe can plot this transition probability as a function of the energy separation ωki between the two states. We would\nexpect that if the separation in energy is smaller, it will be easier to make the transition. This is indeed the case,\nsince P has the shape of a sinc function square.\nNotice that the peak height is proportional to t2, while the zeros appear at 2kπ/t, that is, the peak width is\nproportional to 1/t (the other peaks are quite small). This means that the probability is significantly different than\n\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n-6\n-4\n-2\nFig. 19: Transition probability\nzero only for ωkit ≤ 2π. In terms of energy, we have that ∆t∆E ∼ l (where we defined ∆t as the duration of the\ninteraction), or in other words, we can have a change of energy in the system only at short times, while at long times\nwe require quasi-conservation of energy. Consider the limit of the sinc function:\nsin(ωt/2)\nlim\n= πδ(ω)\nt→inf\nω\nThen, from f(x)δ(x) = f(0) and sinc(0) = 1, we obtain\n( sin(ωt/2) )2\nsin(ωt/2)\nsin(ωt/2)\nsin(ωt/2)\n( sin(ωt/2) ) t\nπt\nlim\n=\nlim\n=\nπδ(ω) =\nπδ(ω) =\nδ(ω)\nt→inf\nω\nω\nt→inf\nω\nω\nωt/2\nWe have then found the transition probability at long time:\nt→infπt\nP (i → k) →\nδ(ω) 4|Vki|2 ,\nwhich confirms the fact that in the long-time limit we need to enforce energy conservation. A better defined quantity\nis the rate of transition:\nW (i → k) = 2π |Vki|2δ(ω).\n(1)\nJ t iωkit\n(1)\nNotice that for ωki = 0, from c\n(t) =\ne\n′ dt ′ we obtain c\n(t) = -iVkit and thus the probability\nk\n-iVki 0\nk\n|ck(t)|2 = |Vki|2t2. There is a quadratic dependence on time for a single final state.\nNow we consider a continuum of final states, all with energy Ekf ≈ Ei. Then the probability of a transition to this\ncontinuum is given by the sum of the probability for each individual state: Pf = L |ck|2 →\nJ\ndEk ρ(Ek)|ck|2, where\nk\nwe defined the density of states ρ(Ek ), such that ρ(Ek )dEk is the number of states with energy between Ek and\nEk + dEk. We can then rewrite the probability as\n( (E -Ei)t )\n|Vki|2\nPi→f = 4\ndEρ(E) sin2\n(E -Ei)2\nUsing the limit of the sinc function, we find\nπt\n|Vki|2\nPi→f = 4\ndEρ(E)δ(E -Ei) 2 (E -Ei)2\nSince all the states are in a neighborhood of the energy, we expect |Vki|2 ≈|V ki|2 over the range of energy of interest.\nThus by evaluating the integral (with the delta function) we obtain the transition probability:\nPi→f = 2|Vki|2πtρ(Ek)|Ek≈Ei\n\n~\nSimilarly, we can calculate the transition rate to a continuum of states. From the expression for a single state,\n2π\nWi→k =\n|Vki|2δ(Ek -Ei), we integrate over all final energies, Wi→f =\nJ\nWi→k ρ(Ek )dEk, where f is the continuum\nof states k such that Ek ≈Ei. Then we obtain the transition rate:\n2π\nW =\n|Vki|2ρ(Ek)|Ek≈Ei\nl\nThis is Fermi's Golden Rule.\nVirtual Transitions\nIf the matrix element of the interaction connecting two given state is zero, we have seen from the expression above\nthat no transition is possible, to first order.\n(2)\nHowever, consider c\n(t). This is given by\nk\n-\nL\n′\ndt ′′\ni\nL\nt\nt\nt\n′\n′′\n′\n′\n(2)\niωkht\niωhit\nVkhVhi\niωkit\niωkht\nc\n(t) =\nVkhVhi\ndt ′\ne\ne\n=\ndt ′ (e\n-e\n)\nk\nh\nh\nsame as before\n≈0\nωki\n| {z }\n| {z }\nIf Eh = Ek, Ei, the second term oscillates rapidly and goes to zero. Finally we have:\n2π\nVkhVhi\nWi→k =\nVki +\nL\nδ(Ek -Ei)\nl\nωki\nh\nor for a continuum\n2π\nVkhVhi\nWi→f =\nL\nρ(Ek)|Ek≈Ei\nVki +\nl\nωki\nh\nNotice that even if Vik = 0, we can still have a transition to k, via virtual transitions to intermediate states, which\nare connected to the two relevant levels.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nFall 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Specifically, we are interested\nin calculating the rate of scattering (and then the cross section), which is nothing else than the transition rate from\nan initial state (initial state of the matter + incoming particle) and a final state (final state of the target + outgoing\nradiation)39 .\nThis is a problem that can be solved by TDPT. Instead of considering a constant perturbation as done to derive\nFermi's Golden rule, we analyze the case of a scattering potential, in its most general form. We describe a scattering\nParticle\nScattering Medium\nV\nt\nFig. 20: Model for scattering: Left, particle trajectory, right time dependency of the potential.\nevent as a particle coming close to a target or a medium, interacting with it and then being deflected away. Thus, as\na function of time, the interaction Hamiltonian V varies as in the figure 20.\n39 A very good resource for scattering theory is Chen, S.H.; Kotlarchyk, M., Interactions of Photons and Neutrons with\nMatter, (2007), which we follow closely in this chapter.\n\nWe want to calculate the probability of scattering from an initial state to a final state:\nI inf\nPscatt = | (f| UI (t) |i) |2 = | (f| (1 -i\nVI (t ′ )dt ′ + . . . ) |i) |2\n-inf\nNotice that we consider negative times as well. This corresponds to the so-called adiabatic switching, since the\ninteraction is assumed to be turned on slowly from the beginning of time and to go down to zero again for long times.\nA. Scattering and Transition matrices\nIn scattering problems, the propagator UI is usually called the scattering matrix S. To simplify the calculation, we\ncan assume again that V is actually time-independent. Then from the first order TDPT we obtain:\n(f| S(1) |i)\nI inf\niωfitdt =\n= -iVfi\ne\n-2πiδ(ωf -ωi) Vfi\n-inf\nNow consider the second order contribution:\n!\nt1\n(f| S(2) |i)\nX\nI inf\niωfmt1\nI\niωmit2\n= -(f|\nV |m) (m| V\n|i)\ndt1e\ndt2e\n-inf\n-inf\nm\nNotice that the last integral is not well defined for t →-inf. To solve it, we rewrite it as\nt1\niωmit+ot\nI\ni(ωmi-io)t2\ne\nt1\no→0+\n-inf\no→0+\nωmi -io\nlim\ndt2e\n= lim -i\n-inf\nNow when taking the limit t →-inf the exponential term eot → 0 (thus getting rid of the oscillations). Then we are\nleft with only\nt1\ni(ωmi-io)t1\nI\ne\niωmit2\ndt2e\n= lim -i\n-inf\no→0+\nωmi -io\nand we obtain (setting now o = 0)\n(f| S(2) |i)\nI inf\nei(ωfi-io)t1\n(f| V |m) (m| V |i)\n= i\nX\nVfmVmi\ndt1\n= -2πiδ(ωf -ωi)\nX\n-inf\nωmi -io\nωi -ωm\nm\nm\nLooking at the first and second order of the scattering matrix, we start seeing a pattern emerge. We can thus rewrite\n:\n(f| S |i) = -2πiδ(ωf -ωi) (f| T |i)\nwhere T is called the transition matrix. Its expansion is given by:\n(f| V |m) (m| V |i)\nVfmVmnVni\n(f| T |i) = (f| V |i) +\nX\n+\nX\n+ . . .\nωi -ωm\n(ωi -ωm)(ωi -ωn)\nm\nm,n\nB. Scattering Probability\nWe can now turn to calculate the scattering probability: PS = | (f| S |i) |2. In order to obtain the total scattering\nprobability, we will need to consider all possible final states. We found:\nPs = 4π2| (f| T |i) |2δ2(ωf -ωi)\n\nWe calculate the square of the Dirac function from its definition based on the limit of the integral:\n1 I inf\n1 I inf\nt\nδ2(ω) =\ndteiωtδ(ω) =\ndtδ(ω) = lim\nδ(ω)\n2π\n2π\nt→inf π\n-inf\n-inf\nThen although the probability is not so well defined, since it contains a limit:\nPs = lim 4πt| (f| T |i) |2δ(ωf -ωi)\nt→inf\nthe rate of scattering is well defined, since it is WS = PS /(2t):\nWS = 2π| (f| T |i) |2δ(ωf -ωi)\nThis is the rate for one isolated final state. If instead we have a continuum of final states, with density of states ρ(ωf )\nwe need to sum over all possible final states:\nWS = 2π\nI\n2π| (f| T |i) |2δ(ωf -ωi)ρ(ωf )dωf = 2π| (f| T |i) |2ρ(ωi)\nNotice that to first order, this is equivalent to the Fermi Golden rule.\n12.1.1 Cross Section\nWe now use the tools developed in TDPT to calculate the scattering cross section. This is defined as the rate of\nscattering divided by the incoming flux of \"particles\":\nd 2σ\nWS (Ω, E)\n∝\nd ΩdE\nΦinc\nWe consider a particle + medium system, where the particle is some radiation represented by a plane wave of\nmomentum k. In general, we will have to define also other degrees of freedom denoted by the index λ, e.g for photons\nwe will have to define the polarization while for particles (e.g.e neutrons) the spin.\nThe unperturbed Hamiltonian is H0 = HR +HM (radiation and medium). We assume that for t →±infthe radiation\nand matter systems are independent, with (eigen)states:\n|i) = |ki, mi) ,\n|f) = |kf , mf )\nwith energies:\nHR |ki) = hωi |ki) ,\nHR |kf ) = hωf |kf ) ,\nHM |mi) = oi |ki) ,\nHM |mf ) = of |mf )\nand total energies: Ei = hωi + oi and Ef = hωf + of .\nParticle\nθ\ndΩ\nScattering Medium\n\nScattering Rate\nThe rate of scattering is given by the expression found earlier:\n2π\nWfi =\n| (f| T |i) |2δ(Ef -Ei)\nh\nAs usual, we want to replace, if possible, the delta-function with the final density of states. However, only the\nradiation will be left in a continuum of states, while the target will be left in one (of possibly many) definite state.\nTo describe this distinction, we separate the final state into the two subsystems.\nWe first define the partial projection on radiation states only, Tkf,ki = (kf | T |ki). By writing the delta function as\nan integral we have:\n2π\n+\nI inf\ni(ωf-ωi)t i(of-oi)t/:\nWfi =\n(mf | Tkf,ki |mi) (mi| T\n|mf )\ne\ne\nkf,ki\nh\n2πh\n-inf\nNow, since e-iHRt/: |mi) = e-ioit/: |mi) (and similarly for |mf ) we can rewrite\n(mf | Tkf ,ki |mi) e i(of-oi)t/: = (mf | e iHRt/:Tkf,kie -iHRt/: |mi) = (mf | Tkf,ki(t) |mi)\nand obtain a new expression for the rate as a correlation of \"transition\" events:\n1 I inf\nWfi =\ne i(ωf-ωi)t (mi| Tk\n+\nf,ki(0) |mf ) (mf | Tkf,ki(t) |mi)\nh2\n-inf\nFinal density of states\nThe final density of states describe the available states for the radiation. As we assumed that the radiation is\nrepresented by plane waves (and assuming for convenience they are contained in a cavity of edge L), the final density\nof states is\n( L )3\nρ(kf )d3kf =\nkf\n2dkf dΩ\n2π\nWe can express this in terms of the energy, ρ(k)d3k = ρ(E)dEdΩ. For example, for photons, which have k = E/hc\nwe have\n( L )3 E2\n( L )3 ω2\nk\nρ(E) = 2\n= 2\n2π\nh3c3\n2π\nhc3\n:2 k2\nwhere the factor 2 takes into account the possible polarizations. For neutrons (or other particles such that E =\n):\n2m\n√\n( L )3 k\n( L )3\n2mE\nρ(E) =\n=\n2π\nh2\n2π\nh3\nIf the material target can be left in more than one final state, we sum over these final states f. Then the average\nrate is given by W S = L Wfiρ(E)dEdΩ (assuming that Wfi does not change very much in dΩ and dE).\nf\nIncoming Flux\n#\nThe incoming flux is given by the number of scatterer per unit area and unit time, Φ =\n. In the cavity considered,\nA t\nv\nwe can express the time as t = L/v, thus the flux is Φ =\n. For photons, this is simply Φ = c/L3, while for massive\nL3\n:k\nparticles (neutrons) v = hk/m, yielding Φ = mL3 .\n\nX\nX\nX\nAverage over initial states\nIf the scatterer is at a finite temperature T it will be in a mixed state, thus we need to sum over all possible initial\nstates:\n-βHM\n-oi/kbT\ne\ne\nρi =\n→\nPi =\nZ\nL\ni e-oi/kbT\nWe can finally write the total scattering rate as:\nWS (i → Ω + dΩ, E + dE) = ρ(E)\nPi\nWfi\ni\nf\nPi\nI inf\n+\nρ(E) I inf\n+\nE\n= ρ(E)\ne iωfit (mi| T\n(0) |mf ) (mf | Tkf,ki(t) |mi) dEdΩ =\ne iωfit D\nT (0)Tfi(t)\nkf,ki\nif\nh2\nh2\n-inf\n-inf\nf,i\nwhere (·) indicates an ensemble average at the given temperature.\n12.1.2 Thermal Neutron Scattering\nUsing the scattering rate above and the incoming flux and density of state expression, we can find the cross section\nfor thermal neutrons. From\n( L )3 mkf\n\nhki\n\n(mL3)2 kf\nρ(E)/Φ =\n/\n=\n2π\nh2\nmL3\n(2πh)3 ki\nwe obtain\nI inf\nd 2σ\nW\nρ(E) 1\n1 ( mL3 )2\nI inf\niωfit D\nT +\nE\nkf\niωfit D\nT +\nE\n= h\n= h\ne\n(0)Tfi(t)\n=\ne\n(0)Tfi(t)\nif\nif\nd Ωdω\nΦ\nΦ h2\n2π\n2πh2\nki\n-inf\n-inf\nNow the eigenstates |ki,f ) are plane waves, (r|k) = ψk(r) = eik·r /L3/2. Then, defining Q = ki -kf the transition\nmatrix element is\nI\n1 I\nd3\nTfi(t) = (kf | T (t) |ki) =\nd3rψkf (r) ∗ T (r, t)ψki(r) =\nreiQ·rT (r, t)\nL3\nL3\nL3\nand\n1 I\nTfi(0)+ = L3\nd3 re -iQ·rT (r, 0)+\nL3\nFermi Potential\nTo first order, we can approximate T by V , the nuclear potential in the center of mass frame (of the neutron+nucleus).\nYou might recall that the nuclear potential is a very strong (V0 ∼ 30MeV) and narrow (r0 ∼ 2fm) potential. These\ncharacteristics seem to preclude a perturbative approach, since the assumption of a weak interaction (compared to\nthe unperturbed system energy) is not satisfied. Still, the fact that the potential is narrow means that the interaction\nonly happens for a very short time. Thus, if we average over time, we expect a weak interaction. More precisely, the\nscattering interaction only depends on the so-called scattering length a, which is on the order a ∼ V0r0. If we keep a\nconstant, different combinations of V, r will give the same scattering behavior. We can thus replace the strong nuclear\npotential with a weaker, pseudo-potential V 0, provided this has a much longer range r0, such that a ∼ V0r0 = V 0r 0.\nWe can choose V 0, r 0 so that the potential is weak (eV) but the range is still short compared to the wavelength\nof the incoming neutron, kr 0 ≪ 1. Then, it is possible to replace the potential with a simple delta-function at the\norigin.\n2πh2\nV (r) =\naδ(r)\nμ\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nD\nE\nX\nμ a ≈ A+1\nWe can also define the bound scattering length, b = mn\nA , were mn is the neutron's mass and A the nucleus\nmass number. Then the potential is\n2πh2\nV (r) =\naδ(r)\nmn\nNote that b (interaction length or bound scattering length) is a function of the potential strength and range, which\ndepend on the isotope from which the neutron is scattered off.\n2π:\nThen to first order the transition matrix is Tfi =\nb, or more generally, if there are many scatterers, each at a\nmn\nposition rx(t), we have:\n2πh2\niQ·rx(t)\nTfi(t) =\nbxe\nmn\nx\nThe scattering cross section becomes\nd 2σ\nI inf\n\n1 kf\niωfit\n-iQ·rx(0) iQ·ry(t)\n=\ne\nbxbye\ne\nd Ωdω\n2π ki\n-inf\nx,y\nNotice that since the collisions are spin-dependent, we should average over isotopes and spin states and replace bxby\nwith bxby.\nScattering Lengths\nNotice that b does not depend explicitly on position, although the position determines which isotope/spin we should\nconsider. What is bxby? We have two contributions. For x = y this is b2δx,y, while for x\ny, it is b (1 -δx,y\n=\n). We\nthen write bxby = (b2 -b )δx,y + b = b2\ni + b2 which defines the coherent scattering length bc = b and the incoherent\nc\nscattering length b2 = b2 -b . If there are N scatterers, we have L bxby = N(bi\n2 + b2).\ni\nc\nStructure Factors\nUsing these definition, we arrive at a simplified expression:\nkf\nd 2σ = N\nbi\n2SS (Q, ω) + b2S(Q, ω)\n\nc\nd Ωdω\nki\nwhere we used the self-dynamic structure factor\nI inf\n\niωfit\n-iQ·rx(0) iQ·rx(t)\nSS (Q, ω) =\ne\ne\ne\n2π\nN\n-inf\nx\nwhich simplifies to\n1 I inf\niωfit\n-iQ·r(0) iQ·r(t)\nSS (Q, ω) =\ne\ne\ne\n2π\n-inf\nif all nuclei are equivalent (same isotope), and the full dynamic structure factor\n1 I inf\n\niωfit\n-iQ·rx(0) iQ·ry(t)\nS(Q, ω) =\ne\ne\ne\n2π\nN\n-inf\nx,y\nThe structure factors depend only on the material properties. Thus they give information about the material when\nobtained from experiments.\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nD\nE\n\nX\n\nX\n\nD\nE\nD\nE\nD\nE\nD\nE\nD\nE\n~\n~\nIntermediate Scattering Function\nFrom the expressions above for the structure factors, it is clear that they can be obtained as the Fourier Transform\n(with respect to time) of the quantities:\n-iQ·r(0) iQ·rx(t)\nFS (Q, t) =\ne\ne\nN\nx\nand\n-iQ·rx(0) iQ·ry(t)\nF (Q, t) =\ne\ne\nN\nx,y\nThese are called the intermediate scattering functions. Going even further, we can write even these function as a\nFourier Transform (with respect to position). For example, for equivalent targets (no distribution in isotope nor\nspin), we have\n-iQ·r(0) iQ·r(t)\nFS (Q, t) =\ne\ne\nBy defining a the position of a test particle, n(R, t) = δ(R -r(t)), we can calculate the fourier transform n(Q, t):\nI\nd3\niQ·R\niQ·r(t)\nn(Q, t) =\nre\nn(R, t) = e\nThen we have FS (Q, t) = (n(Q, t)n(-Q, 0)). We can as well define the van-Hove space-time self correlation function,\nI\n′\n′\n′\nGs(r, t) =\nd3 r (n(r , 0)n(r + r , t))\nwhich represents a correlation of the test particle in space-time. The intermediate scattering function is obtained\nfrom Gs as\nFS (Q, t) =\nI\nd3 reiQ·r Gs(r, t)\nThese final relationship makes it clear that FS is the Fourier transform (with respect to space) of the time-dependent\ncorrelation of the test particle density, n(R, t), which only depends on the target characteristics.\nExample I: Resting, free nucleus\nWe consider the scattering from one resting free nucleus. We need only consider the self dynamics factor and we have\nbc = b = b:\nd 2σ\nkf\nσb kf\n=\nb2S(Q, ω) =\nS(Q, ω)\nd Ωdω\nki\n2πh ki\nwhere we introduced the bound cross section σb = 4πb2 (with units of an area). Since the nucleus is free, the\nintermediate function is very simple. From\n-iQ·r(0) iQ·r(t)\nFS (Q, t) =\ne\ne\nwe can use the BCH formula to write\n-iQ·[r(0)-r(t)]+ 1 [Q·r(0),Q·r(t)]\nFS (Q, t) =\ne\nThen we want to calculate [r(0), r(t)] in order to simplify the product of the two exponential. For a free particle,\nr(t) = r(0) + p t and [r(0), p] = ih. Then we have\nm\n-iQ·[r(0)-r(t)]+i\nQ2 t\n-iQ·p/m\n+i\nQ2 t\n2m\n2m\nFS (Q, t) =\ne\n=\ne\ne\n*X\n+\n*X\n+\nD\nE\nD\nE\nD\nE\nD\nE\nD\nE\n\nD\nE\nD\nE\nand for a nucleus at rest (p = 0) we have\ni:tQ2 /(2m)\nFS (Q, t) = e\nThis gives the structure factor\n(\nhQ2 )\nSs(Q, ω) = δ\nω - 2m\nand the cross-section\nd 2σ\nσb kf\n(\nhQ2 )\n=\nδ\nω -\nd ΩdE\n2πh ki\n2m\nSince Q =\n- ki, we have Q2 = k2 + k2 - 2kikf cos θ. Also, ω =\n- Ei and k2 = 2mEa ≈ 2AEa where we\nkf\ni\nf\nEf\na\nsubstituted A for the mass of the nucleus.\nWe can then integrate the cross-section over the solid angle, to find d σ :\nd E\nI Ei\nd σ\nI π σb kf\n(\nhQ2 )\nAσb\n=\nδ\nω -\n2π sin θdθ =\nδ(x)dx\nd E\n2πh ki\n2m\n4Ei\n(A-1)2/(A+1)2Ei\nDefining the free-atom cross section σf\n(\n1 )-2\nσf =\n1 +\nσb\nA\nwe have\nd σ\n{\n(A+1)2\n(\nA-1f\nσf\n, for\nE < Ef < E\n=\n4AE\nA+1\nd E\n0,\notherwise\nThis expression for the cross section can also be obtained more simply from an energy conservation argument.\nExample II: Scattering from a crystal lattice\nWe consider now the scattering of neutrons from a crystal. For simplicity, we will consider a one-dimensional crystal\nlattice modeled as a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator. The position r → x (in 1D) of a nucleus in the lattice is then\nthe position of an harmonic oscillator of mass M and frequency ω0,\nJ\nh\n+)\nx =\n(a + a\n2Mω0\nwith evolution given by the Hamiltonian\np\nMω2\n+\nH =\n+\nx = hω0(a a +\n)\n2M\nIf we consider no variation of isotope and spin for simplicity, we only need the self-intermediate structure function is\n-iQ·x(0) iQ·x(t)\n-iQ·[x(0)-x(t)] +\n[Q·x(0),Q·x(t)]\nFS (Q, t) =\ne\ne\n=\ne\ne\nFirst remember that\np(0)\nx(t) = x(0) cos(ω0t) +\nsin(ω0t)\nMω0\ni:\nfor an harmonic oscillator.

Finally, we obtained for the intermediate function:\n- Q2~\n1 i~Q2\n-iQ·x(0) iQ·x(t)\n((nˆ)+\n) +\nsin(ω0 t)\n2Mω0\n2 Mω0\nFS (Q, t) =\ne\ne\n= e\ne\n(A2 )/2\nWe can also rewrite this using the Bloch identity Using the Bloch identity,\n(\neA)\n= e\nwhere A = αa + βa+ is\nany combination of the creation and annihilation operators, we can rewrite this as\n-iQ·x(0) iQ·x(t)\n(\neiQ∆x)\ne +\n[Q·x(0),Q·x(t)]\n-Q2(∆x2 )/2 +\n[Q·x(0),Q·x(t)]\nFS (Q, t) =\ne\ne\n=\n= e\ne\nNow,\n(\n∆x2)\n=\n(\nx(0)2)\n+\n(\nx(t)2)\n+ 2 (x(0)x(t)) -([x(0), x(t)]) = 2\n(\nx 2)\n+ 2 (x(0)x(t)) -([x(0), x(t)])\nfrom which we obtain\n-Q2 (x 2) Q2 (x(0)x(t))\nFS (Q, t) = e\ne\nIf the oscillator is in a number state |n), we have\nh\nh\niω0t]\n(\nx 2)\n=\n(2n + 1),\n(x(0)x(t)) =\n[2n cos(ω0t) + e\n2Mω0\n2Mω0\nIf we consider an oscillator at thermal equilibrium, we need to replace n with (n)\n. In the high temperature limit,\nth\n(n) ≫1 and we can simplify:\n~Q2\n-\n(n)[1-cos(ω0t)]\n-Q2 W0/2 Q2W (t)/2\nFS (Q, t) = e\nMω0\n= e\ne\n2(n):\nwith W0 = Mω0 and W (t) = W0 cos(ω0t). This form of the intermediate function is the same expression one would\n-Q2\nobtain from a classical treatment and the term e\nW0 /2 is called the Debye-Waller factor.\nThe intermediate structure function is thus a Gaussian function, with a time-dependent width, W0 -W (t). If W0 < 1\nwe can make an expansion of the time-dependent term:\n-Q2\nQ2\n-Q2\nW0 /2\nW0 cos(ω0t)/2 ≈\nW0 /2\nFS (Q, t) = e\ne\ne\n1 + W0 cos(ω0t) +\nW0\n2 cos 2(ω0t) + . . .\nD\nE\nD\nE\nX\nD\nE\nX\nD\nE\nX\nD\nE\n\nThen the structure factor, which is the Fourier transform of FS will be a sum of Dirac functions at frequencies\nω = ±nω0 corresponding to the n-phonon contribution to the scattering. Here the terms δ(ω -nω0) correspond to\nscattering events where the energy has been transfered from the neutron to the oscillator, while terms δ(ω + nω0)\ndescribe a transfer of energy from the lattice to the neutron. The constant term yields δ(ω) which describes no energy\nexchange or elastic scattering (zero-phonon term). Note that the expansion coefficient, W0 can be expressed in terms\nkbT\n2kbT\nof the temperature, since in the high temperature limit, (n) ≈\n, from which W0 =\n.\n:ω0\nMω2\nIn the low temperature limit, (n) →0. Thus we have:\n- ~Q2\niω0t\n~Q2\n~Q2\niω0 t\n2Mω0 {2(n)[1-cos(ω0t)]+1-e\n}\n-Q2\n2Mω0 e 2Mω0 e\nFS (Q, t) = e\n≈ e\nExpanding in series the second term, we have\n-Q2 ~Q2\nhQ2\n1 ( hQ2 )2\niω0t\n2iω0t\nFS (Q, t) ≈e\n2Mω0\n1 +\ne\n+\ne\n+ . . .\n2Mω0\n2Mω0\nEven at low temperature, the structure factor (the Fourier transform of the expression above) is a sum of Dirac\nfunction, also called a phonon expansion. However in this case only terms δ(ω -nω0) appear, since energy can only\nbe given from the neutron to the lattice (which is initially in its ground state).\n\"\n#\n\nX\nX\n\n12.2 Emission and Absorption\nAtoms and molecules can absorb photons and make a transition from their ground state to an excited level. From\nthe excited state, they can emit photons (either in the presence or absence of a preexisting e.m. filed) and transition\nto a lower level. Using TDPT and the quantization of the field we can calculate the transition rates.\n12.2.1 Emission\n|e,n>\n|g,n+1>\nFig. 21: Model for emission: the atom (molecule) makes a transition from the excited level (|ei) to the ground state )|gi) while\nthe number of photons in the mode k, λ goes from n to n + 1.\nThe rate of emission is given simply by\n2π\nW =\n| (f| V |i) |2ρ(Ef ).\nh\nWe separate the field and the atom (or molecule) levels:\n|i) = |nkλ) |e) ,\n|f) = |nkλ + 1) |g)\nAs we are looking at atomic/optical processes the dipolar approximation is adequate and the interaction is given by:\n-k k\nk\nV =\nd · E = -ekr · E. Remember the expression for the electric field:\nJ\n2πhωk\nk\n(\nikr\n+\n-ikr f\nk\nE =\nakλe\n+ akλe\nokλ\nL3\nk,λ\nThe position of the electron which makes the transition can be written as kr = Rk +ρk, where Rk is the nucleus position.\nSince the relative position of the electron with respect to the nucleus is ρ ≪ λ, we can neglect it and substitute r\nwith R in the exponential (ρk· kk ≪ 1). This simplifies the calculation, since R is not an operator acting on the electron\nstate. Then, from the rate:\n2π\nk\nW =\n| (g| dk|e) · (nkλ + 1| E |nkλ) |2ρ(Ef )\nh\nwe obtain\n(2πe)2\n(\nikR\n+\n-ikRf\n|nkλ) (g|k\nW =\nωk′ ,λ′ (nkλ + 1| ak′ λ′ e\n+ ak′ λ′ e\nr · ok′ ,λ′ |e)\nρ(Ef )\nL3\nk′ ,λ′\nSince we are creating a photon, only terms ∝ a+ survive and specifically the term with the correct wavevector and\n√\n+\npolarization: (nkλ + 1| a\n|nkλ) =\nnkλ + 1 (all other terms are zero). Then we have:\nkλ\n(2πe)2\nW =\nωk,λ(nk,λ + 1) |(g|kr · ok,λ |e)| ρ(Ef )\nL3\nSince the atom is left in a specific final state, the density of states is defined by the e.m. field:\nρ(Ef )dEf = ρ(hωk)hdωk\nX\nX\n\n3 ω2\nL\nL\nAs ωk = ck and ρ(k)d3k =\nk2dkdΩ =\ndωdΩ we have:\n2π\n2π\nc\n( L )3 ω2\nρ(E) =\ndΩ\n2π\nhc3\nWe define the dipole transition matrix element from the dipole operator dk = ekr, dge = (g| d |e). The rate of emission\nis then:\nω3\nk\nk\nW =\n(nkλ + 1)|kokλ · dge|2dΩ\n2πhc3\nFrom this expression it easy to see that there are two contributions to emission:\nSpontaneous emission:\nω3\nk\nk\nW =\n|kokλ · dge|2dΩ\n2πhc3\nwhich happens even in the vacuum e.m. and stimulated emission:\nω3\nk\nk\nW =\nnkλ|kokλ · dge|2dΩ\n2πhc3\nwhich happens only when there are already n photons of the correct mode.\nSpontaneous Emission\n|e,0〉\nk\nθ\nφ\nd\nε2\n|g,1〉\nε1\nFig. 22: Geometry of spontaneous emission\nSince the photons emitted can have any polarization o and any wavevector kk direction, we have to sum over all\npossibilities. We assume that the dipole vector forms an angle θ with respect to the wavevector k. Then the two\npossible polarization vectors are perpendicular to k, as in Fig. 22. The rate is the sum of the rates for each polarization\nWsp = W1 + W2, each proportional to |d · ok1,2|2 ,\nd · ok,1 = d sin θ cos φ,\nd · ok,2 = d sin θ sin φ\nWe thus obtain the typical sin2 θ angular dependence of dipolar radiation (also seen for classical dipoles):\nω3\nk\nWsp =\n|dge|2 sin2 θdΩ\n2πhc3\nThe total emission coefficient, or Einstein's emission coefficient, is obtained by integrating over the solid angle:\nI\nω3\nI 1\n4 ω3\nk\nk d2\nAe =\nW dΩ =\n|dge|22π\n(1 -μ 2)dμ =\nge\nΩ\n2πhc3\n-1\n3 hc3\n\nGiven the rate, we can also calculate the power emitted, as rate times energy\n4 ωk\nd2\n3 c3\nge\nP = hωkAe =\nNotice that this is very similar to the power emitted by a classical oscillating dipole (as if the e.m. field was emitted\nby orbiting electrons).\nStimulated Emission\nIn the stimulated emission, W kλ = nkλW kλ . Only photons with the same frequency (kk) and polarization of the\nst\nsp\nones already in the field can be emitted. Then, as more photons in a particular mode are emitted, it becomes even\nmore probable to produce photons in the same mode: we produce a beam of coherent photons (i.e. all with the same\ncharacteristics and phase coherent with each other). If the atoms can be kept in the excited (emitting) levels, we\nobtain a LASER (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation). Of course, usually it is more probable to\nhave the photons absorbed than to have it cause a stimulated emission, since at equilibrium we usually have many\nmore atoms in the ground state than in the excited state, ng ≫ ne. A mechanism capable of inverting the population\nof the atomics states (such as optical pumping) is then needed to support a laser.\n12.2.2 Absorption\nThe rate of absorption is obtained in a way very similar to emission. The result is\n2π\nω3\nk\nk\nk\nW =\n| (e| dk|g) · (nkλ| E |nkλ + 1) |2ρ(Ef ) =\nnkλ|kokλ · deg |2dΩ\nh\n2πhc3\n√\n(as (nkλ| akλ |nkλ + 1) =\nnkλ).\n12.2.3 Blackbody Radiation\nWe consider a cavity with radiation in equilibrium with its wall. Then the polarization and kk-vector of the photons\nis random, and to obtain the total absorption rate we need to integrate over it, as done for the emission. We obtain\nI\n4 ω3\nk d2\nΩ\n3 hc3\nWab =\nWab(θ)dΩ = nk\nge\nfor a given frequency (and wavevector length). Similarly, the total emission is obtained as the sum of spontaneous\nand stimulated emission:\n4 ωk\nd2\n3 hc3\nge\nIn these expression nk is the number of photons in the mode k. Since we assumed to be at equilibrium, nk depends\nonly on the energy density at the associated frequency ωk. The energy density is given by the energy per volume,\nwhere the energy is given by the total number of photons times their energy, E = nkρ(ωk)hωk:\nWe = Wst + Wsp = (nk + 1)\nu(ωk) = hωkρ(ωk)nk/L3\nL3\nL\nThen, from the density of states ρ(ωk) = 2\nω2 R\ndΩ =\n3π2 ω2, we obtain\n2πc\nc\nπ2 3\nc\nnk =\nu(ωk)\nhω3\nk\nThe rates can then be written in terms of the energy density and of Einstein's coefficients for absorption and emission:\n4 π2\nd2\n→\nWab = Babu(ωk)\nBab = 3 h2\n4 ωk\nBem = Bab,\nAe =\ndge\n→\nWem = Ae + Bemu(ωk)\n3 hc3\n\nE\nX\nX\nX\n\nDetailed Balancing\nAt equilibrium, we need to have the same number of photons absorbed and emitted (to preserve their total number).\nThen NeW k =\nW k . Using Einstein's coefficient, we have Ne(A+uB) =\nBu which yields NeA = uB(Ng -Ne).\nem\nNg\nab\nNg\nThis is the principle of detailed balancing.\nA/B\n:ω3\nWe can solve for the energy density: u =\n. But from their explicit expressions we have A/B =\nand from\nNg/Ne-1\nπ2 c3\nNg\ne -βEg\n-β(Eg-Ee)\nthe condition that atoms are in thermal equilibrium, their population ratio is given by Ne = e-βEe = e\n=\neβ:ωk (since hωk is the exact energy needed for the transition from ground to excited state). Finally, we obtain the\nenergy density spectrum for the black-body:\nhω3/π2c\nu(ωk, T ) = eβ:ωk -1\n12.3 Wigner-Weisskopf Theory\n12.3.1 Interaction of an atom with a single mode e.m. field\nRecall what we studied in Section 10.5. We consider again a two-level system (an atom) interacting with a single\nmode of the e.m. field. The Hamiltonian simplifies to H = H0 + V , with\nH0 = hνa+ a + h ωσz ,\nV = hg(σ+a + σ-a +)\nν\nwhere g = 2\n:L3\nJ\nd · o is the dipole operator.\nWe move to the interaction frame defined by the H0 Hamiltonian, U = eiH0t, then HI = UV U + or\nHI = hge iνta+ a e iωσzt/2(σ+a + σ-a +)e -iνta+ a e -iωσzt/2 = hg\nh\ne i(ω-ν)tσ+a + e -i(ω-ν)tσ-a +i\nWe will use the notation ∆ = ω -ν. We want now to study the evolution of a pure state in the interaction frame:\n\nih ψ = HI |ψ). We can write a general state as |ψ) = L αn(t) |e, n)+βn(t) |g, n). Notice that since we have a TLS,\nn\nσ+ |e) = 0 and σ- |g) = 0. The evolution is then given by:\n+\nih\nα n |e, n) + β n |g, n) = hg\n\nαnσ-a e -i∆t |e, n) + βnσ+ae i∆t |g, n)\n\nn\nn\n√\n√\n-i∆t\ni∆t\n= hg\n\nαne\nn + 1 |g, n + 1) + βne\nn |e, n -1)\n\nn\nWe then project these equations on (e, n| and (g, n|:\n√\ni∆t\nihα n = hgβn+1(t)e\nn + 1\n-i∆t\nihβ n = hgαn-1(t)e\n√ n\nto obtain a set of equations:\n√\ni∆t\n{ α n = -igβn+1e\nn + 1\n√\n\n-i∆t\nβn+1 = -igαne\nn + 1\nThis is a closed system of differential equations and we can solve for αn, βn+1.\nFor example: we can assume that initially the atom is in the excited state |e) and it decays to the ground state |g)\n(that is, βn(0) = 0, ∀n). Then we have:\n( Ωnt )\ni∆\n( Ωnt )\ni∆t/2\nαn(t) = αn(0)e\ncos\n-\nsin\nΩn\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n√\n2ig n + 1\n( Ωnt )\n-i∆t/2\nβn(t) = -αn(0)e\nsin\nΩn\nwith Ω2 = ∆2 + 4g2(n + 1). If initially there is no field (i.e. the e.m. field is in the vacuum state) then α0(0) = 1,\nn\nwhile αn(0) = 0 ∀n = 0. Then there are only two components that are different than zero:\n( Ω0t)\ni∆\n( Ω0t )\ni∆t/2\nα0(t) = e\ncos\n-\nsin\nJ\n∆2 + 4g2\n2ig\n( Ω0t)\n-i∆t/2\nβ1(t) = -e\nsin\nJ\n∆2 + 4g2\nThus, even in the absence of field, it is possible to make the transition from the ground to the excited state! In the\nsemiclassical case (where the field is treated as classical) we would have no transition at all. The oscillations obtained\nin the quantum case are called the vacuum Rabi oscillations.\n12.3.2 Interaction with many modes of the e.m. field\nIn analyzing the interaction of an atom with a single mode of radiation we found that transitions can occur only if\nenergy is conserved. In the real world however we are always confronted with a finite linewidth of any transition. In\norder to find the linewidth we need to look at a multi-mode field.\nConsider the same Hamiltonian as used in the previous section, but now we treat a field with many modes. The\ninteraction Hamiltonian in the interaction frame is given by\n∗\ni(ω-νk)t\n+\n-i(ω-νk)t\nVI = h\ngkakσ+e\n+ gka σ-e\nk\nk\nWe consider a case similar to the one consider at the end of the previous section, where initially the e.m. field is in\nthe vacuum state and the atomic transition creates one photon. Now, however, this photon can be in one of many\nmodes. The state vector is then:\n|ψ(t)) = α(t) |e, 0) +\nβk |g, 1k)\nk\n(now the index k in βk label the mode and not the photon number) and the initial conditions are α(0) = 1, βk(0) = 0,\n∀k. The system of equations for the coefficients are\n∗\n{\nα (t) = -i L\nk gkei(ω-νk)tβk(t)\nβ k(t) = -igke-i(ω-νk)tα(t)\nIf we consider this transition as a decay process from the excited to the ground state, |α(t)|2 gives the decay\nprobability. To solve for α(t) we first integrate β :\nt\n(I\n)\n∗ i(ω-νk)t\n-i(ω-νk)t\nα = -i\ngke\n-igke\n′ α(t ′ )dt ′\nk\nWe can rewrite the expression as:\nt\n′\nα = -\n|gk|2\nI\ndt ′ e -i(ω-νk)(t -t)α(t ′ )\nk\nAssumption 1)\nWe assume that the modes of the e.m. form a continuum, so that we can replace the sum by an integral L\n→\nk\nL\nR\nρ(k)d3k, with the density of states set by νk = ck as usual: ρ(k)d3k = 2\nk2dk dφ sinθdθ.\n2π\n\n\"\n#\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nWe then remember the explicit form of the interaction coupling in terms of the dipole operator:\nνk\n|gk|2 =\n|deg |2 sin2 θ\n4hL3\nand using again νk = ck we obtain\nt\n4|deg |2\nI inf\nν3\nI\n-i(ω-νk)(t -t)α(t ′ )\nα = -\nk dνk\ndt ′ e\n′\n(2π)26hc3\nAssumption 2)\nIn order for the transition to happen, we still need νk ≈ ω.\nThis allows two simplifications: i) we can replace ν3 with ω3 in the integral, and ii) we can extend the lower integral\nk\nlimit to -inf (since anyway we know that it will give contributions only for νk ≈ ω). By furthermore inverting the\norder of the integrals we obtain\nt\nt\nt\n′\nI inf\nνk\n3dνk\nI\ndt ′ · · · →\nI\ndt ′ α(t ′ )ω3\nI inf\ndνk e -i(ω-νk)(t -t) =\nI\ndt ′ α(t ′ )ω32πδ(t -t ′ ) = 2πα(t)ω3\n-inf\nThus, the differential equation defining the evolution of α(t) simplifies to\nd2 ω3\neg\nΓ\nα (t) = -\nα(t) = -\nα(t)\n2π 3hc3\nHere we defined the rate of spontaneous emission\nd2 ω3\neg\nΓ = 3πhc3\nNotice that the decay rate is related to Einstein's emission rate, as Γ = Ae/4π as we should expect, since it is related\nto the total emission (at any frequency) from the excited to the ground state.\n-Γ t\nThus we have simply α(t) = e-Γ t/2 and the decay probability Pd = e\n.\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nFig. 23: Lorentzian lineshape, centered at ω = 12 and with a linewidth Γ = 2\nFrom the expression for α(t) we can go back and calculate an explicit form for βk(t):\nt\n-i(ω-νk)t -Γ t/2\nI\n-i(ω-νk)t\n-Γ t ′ /2\n1 -e\ne\nβk(t) = -i\ndt ′ gke\n′ e\n= gk\n(νk -ω) + iΓ/2\nThe frequency spectrum of the emitted radiation is given by P (νk) = ρ(νk) L\nR\ndΩ |βk(t)|2 in the limit where\nλ=1,2\nΩ\nt →inf.\n1 + e-Γt(1 -2 cos[(ω -νk)t]\nΓ 2\nP (νk) ∝ lim\n∼1/\n+ (ω -νk)2\nt→inf\nΓ 2 + (ω -νk)2\nThus the spectrum is a Lorenztian centered around ω and with linewidth Γ .\n\nX\n12.4 Scattering of photons by atoms\nIn this section we want to study the scattering of photons by electrons (either free electrons or in an atom). We\npreviously studied similar processes:\n- Scattering theory (with an example for thermal neutrons)\n- Emission and absorption of photons (in the dipole approximation)\nNotice that these last processes only involved a single photon (either absorbed or emitted). Now we want to study\nthe scattering of photons, meaning that there will be an incoming photon and an outgoing photon: this is a process\nthat involves two photons.\nk'λ'\n|Af〉\n|Ai〉\nkλ\nFig. 24: Photon scattering cartoon\nIn order to study atom-photon interaction we need of course to start from the quantized e.m. field:\np 2\n1 (\neA )2\nH =\n+ hω(n +\n) =\np -\n+ hω(n +\n)\n2m\n2m\nc\nWe can separate the interaction Hamiltonian as:\np\ne\ne\nH = H0 + V =\n+ hω(n +\n) + -\n(p · A + A · p) +\nA2\n2m\n2mc\n2mc2\n\"\nvV\nJ\n\"\nvV\nJ\nH0\nV\nMore generally, if there are many electrons, the interaction Hamiltonian is given by\ne\ne\nV =\n-\n[pi · A(ri) + A(ri) · pi] +\nA(ri)2\n2mc\n2mc2\ni\ne\nWe already used the first term (in the dipole approximation\np · A → d · E) to find emission and absorption\nmc\nprocesses. As stated, these processes only involve one photon. How do we obtain processes that involve two photons?\nSince from the term p · A and in the first order perturbation theory we do not get them, we will need\ni)\neither terms ∝A2, or\nii) second order perturbation for the term ∝ p · A.\nf2\n(\ne\nNotice that both these choices yield transitions that are ∝ α2 =\n, that is, that are second order in the fine\n:c\nstructure constant.\n2π\n(2)\n(1)\nThus we want to calculate scattering transition rates given by W =\n|K\n+ K\n|2ρ(Ef ), where\n:\n(2)\ne\n- K1\nis the 2nd order contribution from V1 = -\nL\ni pi · Ai and\nmc\n(1)\ne\n- K\nis the 1st order contribution from V2 =\nL Ai\n2 .\n2mc\ni\n(1)\nK\nis instead zero, since it only connects state that differ by one photon (thus it's not a scattering process) and we\nneglect higher orders than the second.\nThe initial and final eigenstates and eigenvalues are as follow (where γ indicate the photon):\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\ns\nInitial\nFinal\nIn.

So there are two possible processes that contribute to K\n,\n- first absorption of one photon in the kλ mode followed by creation of one photon in the k ′ λ ′ mode: the intermediate\nstate is zero photons in these two modes.\n- first creation of one photon in the k ′ λ ′ mode followed by annihilation of the photon in mode kλ: the intermediate\nstate is one photon in each mode.\nExplicitly we have:\n(2)\n(Af | (0kλ1k′ λ′ | V1 |0kλ0k′ λ′ ) |Ah) (Ah| (0kλ0k′ λ′ | V1 |1kλ0k′ λ′ ) |Ai)\nK1\n=\noi -oh + hωk\nh\n(Af | (0kλ1k′ λ′ | V1 |1kλ1k′ λ′ ) |Ah) (Ah| (1kλ1k′ λ′ | V1 |1kλ0k′ λ′ ) |Ai)\n+\noi + hωk -(oh + hωk + hωk′ )\nh\n(2)\n(1)\nNotice that K\nhas an extra factor ∝ ωk in the denominator with respect to K\n. Thus at higher energies of the\n(2)\n(1)\nincident photon (such as x-ray scattering) only K\nsurvives, while at lower energies (optical regime) K\nis more\nimportant.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nA. Types of Scattering\nDepending on the energy hω of the incident photon (with respect to the ionization energy EI of the atom) and on\nthe elastic or inelastic character of the scattering, the scattering process is designated with different names.\n- Rayleigh scattering (Low energy, Elastic): hω ≪ EI , |Eh -EI |, Ef = EI .\nThe final state has the same energy as the initial one, Ef = Ei since the scattering is elastic. The scattering thus\ninvolve intermediate virtual levels, with energies Eh. We will find a cross section σ ∝ω4 .\n- Raman scattering (Low energy, Inelastic): hω ≪ EI , Ef = EI .\nUsually the final state is a different rotovibrational state of the molecule, so the energy difference between initial\nand final state is small. If Ef > EI the scattering process is called Stokes, otherwise if Ef < EI the scattering\nprocess is called anti-Stokes.\n- Thomson scattering (High energy, Elastic): hω ≫ EI , Ef = EI .\nThis process is predominant for, e.g., soft x-ray scattering. This type of scattering can be interpreted in a semi\nclassical way, in the limit where the wavelength λ is larger than the atomic dimensions, λ ≪ a0. The cross section\nis then equivalent to what one would obtain for a free electron, σ =\nπr0\n2 with r0 the effective electron radius.\n- Compton scattering (High energy, Inelastic): hω ≫ EI , λ ≪ a0, Ef = EI .\nFor very high energy, the wavelength is small compared to the atom's size and the energy is much larger than the\nelectron binding energy, so that the final state of the electron is an unbound state. Thus this scattering is very\nsimilar to Compton scattering (inelastic scattering) by a free electron.\nNote that for x-ray scatterings the classification is slightly different than the one given above. There are two processes\nthat competes with Coulomb scattering even at the x-ray energies:\n- Electronic Raman scattering: an inelastic scattering process where the initial atomic state is the ground state and\nthe final state an excited, discrete electronic state.\n- Rayleigh scattering for x-rays: an elastic scattering process, where the final atomic state is the same as the initial\nstate, since there is no atom excitation.\nIn addition to scattering processes, other processes involving the interaction of a photon with electrons are possible\n(besides absorption and emission of visible light that we already studied). In order of increasing photon energy, the\ninteraction of matter with e.m. radiation can be classified as:\nRayleigh/Raman\nPhotoelectric\nThomson\nCompton\nPair\nScattering\nAbsorption\nScattering\nScattering\nProduction\nhω < EI\nhω ≥EI\nhω ≫ EI\nhω ∼ mec2\nhω > 2mec2\n∼eV\n∼keV\n∼keV\n∼MeV\n≥MeV\nVisible\nX-rays\nX-rays\nγ-rays\nhard γ-rays\nB. Semi-classical description of scattering\nA classical picture is enough to give some scaling for the scattering cross section. We consider the effects of the\ninteraction of the e.m. wave with an oscillating dipole (as created by an atomic electron).\nThe electron can be seen as being attached to the atom by a \"spring\", and oscillating around its rest position with\nfrequency ω0. When the e.m. is incident on the electron, it exerts an additional force. The force acting on the electron\nis F = -eE(t), with E(t) = E0 sin(ωt) the oscillating electric field. This oscillating driving force is in addition to the\nattraction of the electron to the atom ∼-kxe, where k (given by the Coulomb interaction strength and related to\nthe binding energy EI ) is linked to the electron's oscillating frequency by ω0\n2 = k/me.

In this case we\nconsider thus one single electron. Also in general, the photon should have energy high enough that the electron is\nseen as free even if in reality it is part of an atom (thus the photon energy must be larger than the atom's ionization\nenergy, hω ≫ EI or in other terms λ ≫ than the atom's size). Note that in Thomson scattering the final electron is\nstill a bound electron (elastic scattering) while in Compton scattering the electron is unbound (inelastic scattering).\nStill, since the binding energy is small compared to the other energy at play, the electron can be considered as a free\nelectron, and many of the characteristics of Compton scattering still apply.\nInitial\nFinal\n-\ne :\n|Ai)\n|Af )\nEn:\nφ:\n|1k,λ, 0k′ ,λ′ )\n|0k,λ, 1k′ ,λ′ )\npx:\ntot:\n|i)\n|f)\npy:\nInitial\nFinal\nmc2 + hck\n=\nhck ′ +\nJ\np2 ec2 + m2c4\nhk\n=\nhk ′ cos θ + p cos φ\n=\nhk ′ sin θ -p sin φ\n40 The Bohr radius is a different quantity: rB ∼\n:\n2 with some constants (depending on the units chosen) to give about\nme\nrB ∼ 5 × 10-11 m\n\nThe initial and final states, as well as energies and momentum are written above. They result from the conservation\nof energy and momentum for a relativistic electron which is initially at rest.\n? Question: What is the ratio k/k ′ ? What is ∆λ = λ ′ -λ? (This is the usual Compton scattering formula).\nFrom conservation of energy and momentum and with the geometry of figure 25, we can calculate the energy of the scattered\nphoton.\n\n′\n′\n′\n|p|2 2 +\n2 4\nEγ + Ee = Eγ + Ee\n→\nhω + mec = hω +\nc\nm c\n{\n′\nhk = hk ′ cos θ + p cos φ\nh k = h k + p\n→\nhk ′ sin θ = p sin φ\n:(ω ′ -ω) [\n2]\n\nFrom these equations we find p =\nc2\nh(ω ′ -ω) -2mc\nand cos φ =\n1 -h2k′2 sin2 θ/p2.

It describes for example visible light\n(2)\nscattering from atoms: in that case, the predominant contribution comes from the term K\n. Rayleigh scattering\nalso describes coherent, elastic scattering of x-rays from atoms (e.g. in a crystal) and is an important process in x-ray\ndiffraction.\nIn the case of x-ray scattering, the photon energy is larger then the electronic excitation energy: hω ≫ Eb. Then\n(2)\n(1)\n(2)\nwe have, as stated above, K\n≪ K\nand we can neglect the K\ncontribution. As we are considering now bound\nd Ef\nL\n3 k ′2\nelectrons, the recoil is zero, and\n= hc. Then the density of states is simply ρ(Ef ) =\ndΩ.\nd k′\n2π\n:c\nThe cross section is given by\n(1)\nd σ = 2π |K\n|2 ρ(Ef ) = 2π c2r2 ( 2πh )2 1 ( L )3 k ′2\n|okλ · ok′ λ′ |2| (Af |\ne\nri |Ai) |2\ne\ni~q·~\nd Ω\nh c/L3\ndΩ\nh c/L3\nL3\nkk′\n2π\nhc\ni\nk\ni~q·~\n= re\n( ω ′ )\n|okλ · ok′ λ′ |2| (Af |\ne\nri |Ai) |2\nω\ni\nConsider an elastic scattering process (the inelastic scattering is called Raman scattering for x-rays).

Thus in general we expect Rayleigh\ni\nscattering to be weaker for lighter elements.\n2) In general we can rewrite the sum as an integral L\ni ei~q·~ri →\nR\nei~q·~rρ (r)d3r using the charge density ρ(r) =\nL δ(r -ri). Then the atomic form factor takes the form:\ni\nf(p) = (g|\nI\ne i~q·~rρ (r)d3 r |g) =\nI\ne i~q·~rρ(r)d3 r\nwith ρ(r) = (g| ρ (r) |g). Then the atomic form factor is the Fourier transform of the charge density.\nScattering from a crystal\nIn a crystal, we can rewrite the electron positions with the substitution ri → Rl + rli, where Rl is the atom position\n(or the nucleus position or the atomic center of mass position). Then we need to sum over all atoms and all electrons\nin the atom. Then we have the structure factor:\nG(q) = (g|\ne i~q·Rle i~q·~ril |g) =\nfl(q)e i~q·Rl\nl,i\nl\nwith fl = (g| L\ni ei~q·~ril |g).\nIn a crystal we can rewrite the atom position as Rlj = l1a1 + l2a2 + l3a3 +\nrj\n.

Then, instead of using the full\ninteraction V1 + V2 we can safely substitute it with the electric dipole Hamiltonian41 , V = -dk· Ek. This Hamiltonian\ndoes not produce any two-photon process to first order, so in this case we need to consider the term K(2). This term\ninvolves virtual transitions. Since the duration of these transitions is very small, we do not have to worry about\nconservation of energy. Recall:\nK(2)\n(f| V |h) (h| V1 |i)\n=\n,\nEi -Eh\nh\nk\nwhere V = -dk · E. The intermediate states are either |h) = |Ah) |0kλ0k′ λ′ ) or |h) = |Ah) |1kλ1k′ λ′ ). It would be of\ncourse possible to derive the scattering cross section from the vector-potential/momentum Hamiltonian, and in that\n(1)\n(2)\ncase both terms K2\nand K1\nshould be included 42 .\nThe electric field in the Lorentz gauge is\nJ\n2πhωl\nE =\n(\nil·R + a +\n-il·Rf\nolξ,\nalξe\nlξe\nL3\nl,ξ\nand thus we obtain for (h| V1 |i) and (f| V1 |h):\n- (0kλ1k′ λ′ |\n(\nalξeil·R + a +\n-il·Rf\n|0kλ0k′ λ′ ) = e-ik ′ ·Rδl,k′\nlξe\n- (0kλ0k′ λ′ |\n(\nalξeil·R + alξ\n+ e-il·Rf\n|1kλ0k′ λ′ ) = eik·Rδl,k\n+\n- (0kλ1k′ λ′ |\n(\nalξeil·R + a\n-il·Rf\n|1kλ1k′ λ′ ) = eik·Rδl,k\nlξe\n- (1kλ1k′ λ′ |\n(\nalξeil·R + a + e-il·Rf\n|1kλ0k′ λ′ ) = e-ik ′ ·Rδl,k′\nlξ\nthus we have\n2πh√\n(Af | d · ok′ |Ah) (Ah| d · ok |Ai)\n(Af | d · ok |Ah) (Ah| d · ok′ |Ai)\n(2)\ni(k-k ′ )R\nK\n=\nωkωk′ e\n+\nL3\noi -oh + hωk\noi + hωk -(oh + hωk + hωk′ )\nh\nh\nW\nThe scattering cross section is given as usual by d σ =\n. and the density of state (assuming no recoil) is\nd Ω\nc/L3\n( L )3 k ′2\nρ(Ef ) =\ndΩ.\n2π\nhc\nFinally the cross section is given by:\nd σ\n2π ( 2πh)2\n( L )3 k ′2 L3\n(dfh · ok′ )(dhi · ok)\n(dfh · ok)(dhi · ok′ )\n=\nωkωk′\n+\nd Ω\nh\nL3\n2π\nhc c\noi -oh + hωk\noi -oh -hωk′\nh\nd σ\n(dfh · ok′ )(dhi · ok)\n(dfh · ok)(dhi · ok′ )\n= kk ′3\n+\nd Ω\noi -oh + hωk\noi -oh -hωk′\nh\n41 A unitary transformation changes the Coulomb-gauge Hamiltonian into an expansion in terms of multipoles of the electro\nmagnetic fields. For atomic interactions, only the electric dipole is kept, while higher multipoles, such as magnetic dipole and\nelectric quadrupole, can be neglected. This unitary transformation is describe, e.g., in Cohen-Tannoudji's book, Atom-Photons\nInteractions\n42 This derivation can be found in Chen, S.H.; Kotlarchyk, M., Interactions of Photons and Neutrons with Matter, (2007)\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nA. Rayleigh scattering\nRayleigh scattering describes elastic scattering, for which ωk = ωk′ since |Af ) = |Ai). Then we can simplify the cross\nsection:\nd σ\n(dih · ok)(dhi · ok)\n(dih · ok)(dhi · ok)\n= k4\n+\nd Ω\noi -oh + hωk\noi -oh -hωk\nh\nAt long wavelengths hωk ≪ oh -oi, thus we can neglect ωk in the denominator. Then\nd σ\nd Ω ∝ω4\nk 2\nh\n(dih · ok)(dhi\noi -oh\n· ok)\nand simplifying we obtain that\nd σ\nd Ω ∝ ω4\nk\nThis expression could have been found from the classical cross section we presented earlier, in the same limit ω ≪ ω0.\nThe Rayleigh scattering has a very strong dependence on the wavelength of the e.m. wave. This is what gives the\nblue color to the sky (and the red color to the sunsets): more scattering occurs from higher frequencies photons (with\nshorter wavelength, toward the blue color).\nAs light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red,\norange and yellow light is affected by the air. However, much of the shorter wavelength light is scattered in different\ndirections all around the sky. Whichever direction one looks, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since the\nblue light is seen from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.Closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler\nin color, since the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other\ndirections and the color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white. As the sun begins to set, the light must\ntravel farther through the atmosphere. More of the light is reflected and scattered and the sun appears less bright.\nThe color of the sun itself appears to change, first to orange and then to red. This is because even more of the short\nwavelength blues and greens are now scattered and only the longer wavelengths are left in the direct beam that\nreaches the eyes. Finally, clouds appear white, since the water droplets that make up the cloud are much larger than\nthe molecules of the air and the scattering from them is almost independent of wavelength in the visible range.\nB. Resonant Scattering\nAn interesting case arises when the incident photon energy matches the difference in energy between the atom's\ninitial state and one of the intermediate levels. This phenomenon can occur both for elastic or inelastic scattering\n(Rayleigh or Raman). Assume that hωk = oh -oi for a particular h in the sum over all possible intermediate levels.\n(2)\nThen, only first term important in K\n(describing first absorption and then emission) is important. In order to\nkeep this term finite, we introduce a finite width of the level, Γ . The cross section then reduces to:\nd σ\n(dfh · ok′ )(dhi · ok)\n|(dfh · ok′ )(dhi · ok)|2\n= kk ′3\n= kk ′3\nd Ω\noh -oi -hωk -ihΓ/2\n(oh -oi -hωk)2 + h2Γ 2/4\n:ωk≈oh-oi\n:ωk≈oh-oi\nThis cross section describes Raman resonance and, for k = k ′ resonance fluorescence.\n12.4.4 Photoelectric Effect\nIn this section we want to use scattering theory of a photon from electron(s) in an atom to explain the photoelectric\neffect. We consider the case of an hydrogen-like atom with atomic number Z and we calculate the differential cross\nsection\ndσ\nWfi\n=\ndω\nΦinc\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\"\n#\n\nX\nh\ni\n\nX\n\n~\ns\n~\nwhere Wfi is the transition rate for the scattering event and Φinc is the incoming photon flux. The incoming photon\nflux can be calculated by assuming (for convenience) that the system is enclosed in a cavity of volume V = L3 (so\nthat there's only one photon in that volume). The incoming flux of photons in the cavity is given by the number of\nphotons per unit area and time:\n#photons\nc\nΦ =\n=\n=\ntime · Area\nL/cL2\nL3\nwhere the area is L2 and the time to cross the cavity is t = L/c. The transition rate Wfi is given by Fermi's Golden\nRule, assuming an atom-photon interaction V and a density of final state ρ(Ef ):\n2π\nWfi =\n| (f| V |i) |2ρ(Ef )\nh\nHere the final density of states ρ(Ef ) is expressed in terms of the momentum p of the scattered electron and the\nsolid angle dΩ where it is ejected. Indeed, as the photon is absorbed, the final density of states is only given by the\nfree electron, again assumed to be enclosed in the volume V . The density of states for the electron is given by the\ndensity of momentum states in the cavity L3 assuming the electron propagates as a plane wave:\n( L )3\nρ(Ef )dEf = ρ(pk)d3pk =\np 2dpdΩ\n2πh\nwith the (non-relativistic) energy for the electron given by Ef = p2/(2m) giving dEf = pdp/m. Finally\n( L )3\nρ(Ef ) =\nmpdΩ\n2πh\ne k\nWe next want to calculate the transition matrix element (f| V |i), where V = -\nA · pk. The relevant states are\nmc\nthe photon states 1~\n)\nand 0~\n)\nand the electron momentum eigenstates, which in the position representation are\nkλ\nkλ\nψi(kr) = (kr|ie) and ψf (kr) = (kr|fe).\nThe matrix element between the relevant states is then:\ne\n2πhc2\ni~h·~r\n+\n-i~h·~r\nVif = -\n(fe|\n(\n0~\na~ e\n+ a\ne\no~\n· pk 1~\n)\n|ie)\nkλ\nL3ωh\nhξ\n~hξ\nh,ξ\nkλ\nmc\nh,ξ\ne\nJ\n2πh\ni~h·~r\n+\n-i~h·~\n= -\n(fe|\n((\n0~\na~\n1~\n)\ne\n+\n(\n0~\na\n1~\n)\ne\nrf\no~ · pk |ie)\nkλ\nhξ\nkλ\nkλ\n~\nkλ\nhξ\nm\nL3ωh\nhξ\nh,ξ\nThe only surviving term is\ne\nJ\n2πh\ni~k·~\nVif = -\n(fe| e\nro~\n· kp |ie)\nkλ\nm\nL3ωk\nThen turning to the position representation of |ie) , |fe) and of the momentum operator, we can calculate an explicit\nexpression. Using ψi(kr) = (kr|ie), ψf (kr) = (kr|fe) and o~\n· pk = o~\n· (-ih∇), we have:\nkλ\nkλ\ni~\nI\nk·~\ni~k·~\n(fe| e\nro~\n· pk |ie) =\nd3kr ψ f\n∗ (kr)e\nro~\n· (-ih∇ψi(kr))\nkλ\nkλ\nV\nFinally\ne\nJ\n2πh I\nf (k\ni~k·~\n(f| V |i) = -\nd3kr ψ ∗ r)e\nro~\n· (-ih∇ψi(kr))\nkλ\nm\nL3ωk\nV\nThe final wave function ψf is just a plane wave with momentum k = p/h (in the volume L3). The initial wave\nq\nk\nfunction is instead a bound state. You should have seen that for an hydrogen-like atom the wave function is given by\nX\nh\ni\nX\n\ns\n-|~\ne\nψi(kr) =\n√\nr|/a , where a is the Bohr radius scaled by the atomic number Z (a = h2/(me2Z)). Replacing the explicit\nπa3\nexpressions for ψi and ψf in the previous result we obtain:\n-|~r|/a\ni(~\n(f| V |i) = - e\nJ\n2πh √ 1\nI\nd3kre k-q~)·~rko~kλ · -ih∇\n( e√\n)\nm\nL3ωk\nL3\nV\nπa3\nk\ni∆~k·~\nWe now define ∆kk = k -qk and evaluate the integral:\nR\nd3 kre\nrko~\n· ∇ψi by parts:\nV\nkλ\nI\nd3 kre i∆~k·~rko~\n· ∇ψi = e i∆~k·~rψi|L3 -i∆kk · ko~\nI\nd3 kre i∆~k·~rψi(kr)\nkλ\nkλ\nV\nV\nNotice that the wavefunction vanishes at the boundaries, so the first term is zero.

Mathematical Formalism of Quantum Mechanics\n2.1\nLinear vectors and Hilbert space\n2.2\nOperators\n2.2.1\nHermitian operators\n2.2.2\nOperators and their properties\n2.2.3\nFunctions of operators\nQuantum mechanics is a linear theory, and so it is natural that vector spaces play an important role in it. A physical\nstate is represented mathematically by a vector in a Hilbert space (that is, vector spaces on which a positive-definite\nscalar product is defined); this is called the space of states. Physical properties like momentum, position, energy,\nand so on will be represented by operators acting in the space of states. We will introduce the essential properties\nof Hilbert spaces, mainly in the case of finite dimension, as the mathematical theory of Hilbert spaces of infinite\ndimension is much more complicated than that of spaces of finite dimension\n2.1 Linear vectors and Hilbert space\nD: Linear vector space A linear vector space is a set of elements, called vectors, which is closed under addition and\nmultiplication by scalars.\nUsing Dirac notation, the vectors are denoted by kets: |k). We can associate to each ket a vector in the dual space\ncalled bra: (ψ|.\nIf two vectors |ψ) and |φ) are part of a vector space, then ψ + φ also belongs to the space. If a vector ψ is in\nthe space, then α |ψ) is also in the space (where α is a comp\n|\nle\n)\nx sc\n|\nala\n)\nr).\n| )\nA set of linearly independent vectors\nφi\nis such that\nk ck φk = 0 if and only if ck = 0\nk (no trivial combination\nof them sums to zero).\n{|\n)}\n|\n)\n∀\nThe dimension of the space N is the maximum numbe\nL\nr of linearly independent vectors (which is also the smallest\nnumber of vectors that span the space).\nD: Basis A maximal set of linearly independent vectors in the space is called a basis. (e.g.\nφk\n, k = 1, . . . , N).\nAny vector in the space can be written as a linear superposition of the basis vectors:\n{|\n)}\n|ψ) =\n\nak\nk\n|φk)\n(1)\nTo any vector we can thus associate a column vector of N complex numbers (a1, a2...an)T . Here we are going to\nrestrict ourselves to bounded, finite dimension spaces (even if many physical spaces are not: for example energy\nspaces can be unbounded and position has infinite dimension).\nD: Hilbert space The Hilbert space is a linear vector space over complex numbers with an inner product.\nD: Inner product\nAn inner product is an ordered mapping from two vectors to a complex number (for a Hilbert\nspace a mapping from a ket and a bra to a complex number c = (ψ|φ)) with the following properties:\n- positivity: (ψ|ψ) ≥0. The equality holds only for the zero vector |ψ) = 0.\n- linearity in the second function: (ψ|(c1φ1) + c2|φ2)) = c1(ψ|φ1) + c2(ψ|φ2).\n\n- anti-linearity in the first function:((c1φ1 + (c2|φ2)|ψ(= c∗\n1 φ1 ψ + c∗\n2 φ2 ψ .\n- skew symmetry: (ψ\nφ\n(\n|φ\n(\n) =\n| )\n| )\n( |ψ)∗\nD: Norm The norm of a vector is 1ψ1 =\n(ψ|ψ).\nSince the Hilbert space is characterized by its inner product, vectors are defined up to a global phase, that is,\n|ψ) = eiθ|ψ). Relative phase is instead ver\np\ny important: |ψ) + eiθ|φ) = |ψ) + |φ).\nThe inner product properties allow us to define two geometric inequalities:\n- Schwartz inequality:\nψ φ\nψ ψ\n- Triangular inequality\n|(\n:\n(\n|\nψ\n)\n+\n|\nφ\n≤\n)\n( | )\nφ\n(φ|φ\n+\n).\n1 ≤1 1\n1ψ1.\nThe equality holds only if the two vectors are in the same direction: |ψ) = c|φ).\nThere is also an antilinear correspondence between the dual vectors ket and bra:\nc1|ψ1) + c2|ψ2) →c∗\n1(ψ1| + c2\n∗ (ψ2|\nD: Orthonormal set A set of vectors {|φk)} is orthonormal if for each pair the inner product (φk| φj ) = δk,j .\n2.2 Operators\nWe can define a set of operators that acting on the vectors return vectors:\nD: Operator An operator A on a vector space is a mapping between two vectors in that space: A|ψ) = |φ).\nA linear operator satisfies:\nA(c1|ψ1) + c2|ψ2)) = c1A|ψ1) + c2A|ψ2)\nTo characterize and parametrize A we look at its action on each vector in the space. Because of linearity, it is\nhowever enough to characterize A with its action on the N basis vectors\nφ k . In this way we can associate a\nmatrix representation to any operator, in the same way we associated array\n{\ns\n|\nof\n)\nc\n}\nomplex numbers with the vectors.\nIn particular, given an orthonormal basis {|v)k}, the matrix representation of the operator A is an N × N square\nmatrix A whose elements are given by Ak,j = (vk| A |vj ).\nN\nLet us consider an orthonormal basis {vi}, then as seen any vector can be written as: |ψ) = L\ni=1 ai|vi). The action\nof an operator A becomes:\nN\nN\nA|ψ) = |φ) →\n\nAai|vi) =\n\nbi|vi\ni=1\ni=1\n)\nTo extract one of the coefficients, say bk we multiply by the bra (vk |, obtaining:\n\nN\nvk Aai vi = bk\nAkiai = bk\ni=1\n(\n|\n|\n)\n→\n\ni\nThe action of an operator can be thus seen as a matrix multiplication (again, here we are restricting to bounded,\nfinite dimension spaces that support finite operators, hence this simple matrix representation).\n? Question: Perform a simple matrix multiplication.\n\n· 0 =\n\nThis is equivalent to Rx · vvz = vvy.\nThe domain of an operator is the subspace on which it acts non-trivially (spanned by k ≤ N vectors).\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nTwo operators A and B are equal if their domains are the same and their action is equal ∀|ψ) in their domains. The\nsum and product of operators are then defined as\n(A + B)|ψ) = A|ψ) + B|ψ))\n(AB)|ψ) = A(B|ψ))\nThe operators are associative:\nA(BC)|ψ) = (AB)C|ψ)\nBut they are not in general commutative:\nAB|ψ) = BA|ψ)\nD: Commutator . The commutator of two operators is [A, B] = AB -BA. Two operators commute/are commutable\nif [A, B] = 0.\n2.2.1 Hermitian operators\nAn important class of operators are self adjoint operators, as observables are described by them.\nD: Adjoint The adjoint of an operator A+ is an operator acting on the dual space with the property:\n(\n(A+ψ)\nφ) =\n(ψ|(Aφ)), ∀{|ψ) , |φ)}. We can also have other notations. From (φ|ψ) = (ψ|φ)∗ (where ∗ indicates the complex\nconjugate) we have\n(\n(A+ψ)\n\nφ) = (ψ|(Aφ)) = (φ|A+ψ)∗. Also, we can write the inner product as (φ|(Aψ)) = (φ|A|ψ)\n\nand ((Aφ)|ψ) = (φ|A+|ψ). In matrix representation, this means that the adjoint of an operator is the conjugate\n+\ntranspose of that operator: A\n= (k| A+ |j) = (j| A |k) ∗ = A∗\nk,j\nj,k.\nD: Self-adjoint . A self adjoint operator is an operator such that A and A+ operate on the same domain and with\nthe property\n(ψ|A|φ) = (φ|A|ψ)∗\nor shortly, A+ = A. In matrix representation we have then: Aki = A∗\nik .\n? Question: Prove that (cA)+ = c ∗ A+\n∗ A+\nWe want to prove that (cA)+ = c\n. We can take two strategies:\n1) From the adjoint operator definition in the form:\nB+φ|ψ = φ|Bψ ,\nwith B = cA we obtain:\n+\n+\n∗\n+\n(cA) φ|ψ = φ|cAψ = c φ|Aψ = c A φ|ψ = c A φ|ψ\n2) Alternatively, we can use the adjoint definition in Dirac's notation:\nφ|B+|ψ = ψ|B|φ ∗ ,\nto get:\n+\n∗\n∗\n∗\n∗\n+\n∗\n+\nφ|(cA) |ψ = ψ|cA|φ = c ψ|A|φ = c φ|A |ψ = φ|c A |ψ\nNote that we can write\n(B+φ|ψ) = (φ|Bψ) = (φ|B|ψ) = (ψ|B+|φ)∗ .\nThe second notation (based on Dirac's notation) could be seen as implying (|φ))+ = (φ| (and thus (A|φ))+ =\n(\nA+φ\n.\nHowever, this applies the adjoint operation to a vector, while the adjoint is only properly defined for operators. For\ndiscrete dimensional spaces, which allow a matrix representation, there is no ambiguity since we have the equivalence\nof the adjoint with the complex-transpose of an operator (which can be defined also for vectors)4 .\n4 See also quant-ph/9907069 page 12, for a subtle difference between Hermitian and self-adjoint infinite-dimensional operators\n\n? Quest\nProve that (AB)+\nion:\n= B+A+\n∀|ψ we have |φ = (AB)|ψ → φ| = ψ| (AB)+. Define |φ = B|ψ , then |φ = A|φ , φ| = ψ| B+ and φ| = φ| A+, so that\nφ| = ψ| B+A+ .\nA self-adjoint operator is also Hermitian in bounded, finite space, therefore we will use either term. Hermitian\noperators have some properties:\n1. if A, B are both Hermitian, then A + B is Hermitian (but notice that AB is a priori not, unless the two operators\ncommute, too.).\n2. if A, B are both Hermitian but do not commute, then at least AB + BA is Hermitian.\n? Question: Prove property # 2.\n(AB + BA)+ = B+A+ + A+B+ = BA + AB.\nBefore describing other properties we need the following definition.\nD: Eigenvector We define a right eigenvector as a column vector ψ R satisfying A ψ R = λR ψ R, so (A\nλR11) ψ R =\n0, which means the right eigenvalues λR must have zero dete\n|\nrm\n)\ninant, i.e., de\n|\nt(\n)\nA - λR1\n|\n1)\n)\n= 0.

We thus have a1⟨a2|a1⟩= a2⟨a2|a1⟩\nwhich is satisfied iif a1 = a2 (contrary to the hypothesis) or if ⟨a2|a1⟩= 0.\n2.2.2 Operators and their properties\nD: The Outer Product |ψ⟩⟨φ| is an operator, since acting on a vector returns a vector: (|ψ⟩⟨φ|) |φ⟩= ⟨φ|φ⟩|ψ⟩.\nIt defines a projector oP\nperator Pi = |vi⟩⟨vi|. The sum over all projectors on the space is the identity, therefore, for\nany basis set we have:\ni |vi⟩⟨vi| = 11 (closure relation). The product of two projectors is PjPk = δikPj. Projectors\nderive their name from thPe property that they project out a vector component of the related basis vector: given\nPj = |vj⟩⟨vj|, Pj|ψ⟩= Pj\nk ck |vk⟩= cj |vj⟩.\nP\nD\nN\n: Trace -\nThe trace of an operator is the sum of the diagonal elements of an operator Tr {A} = P\nj=1 Ajj =\nj ⟨vj| A |vj⟩. It is independent of the choice of basis.\nt\nD: Spectral Decomposition - The spectral theorem states that given a self-adjoint operator A on a linear space\n,\nhere exists an orthonormal basis of\nconsisting of eigenvectors of A. Equivalently, we can state that A can\nH\nbe\nwritten as a linear combination of pa\nH\nirwise orthogonal projections (which are formed from its eigenvectors). This\nrepresentation of A is called its spectral decomposition: A =\nj aj |vj⟩⟨vj|, where A |vj⟩= aj |vj⟩. In this basis, the\nmatrix representation of A is diagonal.\nP\n■Theorem: If two hermitian operators commute, they share a common set of eigenvectors.\nIf [A, B] = 0 then AB = BA.

It is thus necessary to establish a set of\nrules to map physical concepts and objects into mathematical objects that we use to represent them5. Sometimes\nthis mapping is evident, as in classical mechanics, while for quantum mechanics the mathematical objects are not\nintuitive. In the same way as classical mechanics is founded on Newton's law or electrodynamics on the Maxwell-\nBoltzmann equations, quantum mechanics is also based on some fundamental laws, which are called the postulates\nor axioms of quantum mechanics. The axioms we are going to see apply to the dynamics of closed quantum systems.\nWe want to develop a mathematical model for the dynamics of closed systems: therefore we are interested in defining\nstates, observables, measurements and evolution. Some subtleties will arise since we are trying to define measurement\nin a closed system, when the measuring person is instead outside the system itself. We give below (and explain in\nthe next few sections) one formulation of the QM axioms. Different presentations (for example starting from density\noperators instead of state vectors) are possible.\n1. The properties of a quantum system are completely defined by specification of its state vector ψ . The state\nvector is an element of a complex Hilbert space H called the space of states.\n| )\n2. With every physical property A (energy, position, momentum, angular momentum, ...) there exists an associated\nlinear, Hermitian operator A (usually called observable), which acts in the space of states\n. The eigenvalues of\nthe operator are the possible values of the physical properties.\nH\n3.a If |ψ) is the vector representing the state of a system and if |φ) represents another physical state, there exists a\nprobability p(|ψ), |φ)) of finding |ψ) in state |φ), which is given by the squared modulus of the scalar product on\nH: p( ψ , φ ) =\nψ φ\n3.b If A\n|\nis\n)\nan\n|\no\n)\nbserv\n|(\nable\n| )\nw\n|2 (Born Rule).\nith eigenvalues ak and eigenvectors |k) (A|k) = ak|k)), given a system in the state ψ , the\nprobability of obtaining ak as the outcome of the measurement of A is p(a\n| )\nk) =\nk ψ\n. After the measurement\nthe system is left in the state projected on the subspace of the eigenvalue a\n|( | )|\nk (Wave function collapse).\n4. The evolution of a closed system is unitary. The state vector ψ(t)\nat time t is derived from the state vector\n|ψ(t0)) at time t0 by applying a unitary operator U(t, t0), called\n|\nthe\n)\nevolution operator: |ψ(t)) = U(t, t0) |ψ(t0)).\n5 See: Leslie E. Ballentine, \"Quantum Mechanics A Modern Development\", World Scientific Publishing (1998). We follow\nhis presentation in this section.\n\n3.2 The axioms of quantum mechanics\n3.2.1 Observables and State Space\nA physical experiment can be divided into two steps: preparation and measurement. The first step determines the\npossible outcomes of the experiment, while the measurement retrieves the value of the outcome. In QM the situation\nis slightly different: the first step determines the probabilities of the various possible outcomes, while the measurement\nretrieve the value of a particular outcome, in a statistic manner. This separation of the experiment is reflected into\nthe two types of mathematical objects we find in QM. The first step corresponds to the concept of a state of the\nsystem, while the second to observables.\nThe state gives a complete description of the set of probabilities for all observables, while these last ones are all\ndynamical variables that in principle can be measured. All the information is contained in the state, irrespectively on\nhow I got the state, of its previous history. For the moment we will identify the state with the vectors of an Hilbert\nspace |ψ). We will see later on that a more general definition exists in terms of state operators ρ.\nAll physical observables (defined by the prescription of experiment or measurement ) are represented by a linear\noperator that operates in linear inner product space (an Hilbert space in case of finite dimensional spaces). States of\nthe system are represented by the direction/ray (not a vector) in the linear inner product space (again Hilbert space\nin the finite dimensional case).\n3.2.2 Quantum measurement\nThe value of the measurement of an observable is one of the observable eigenvalues. The probability of obtaining one\nparticular eigenvalue is given by the modulus square of the inner product of the state vector of the system with the\ncorresponding eigenvector. The state of the system immediately after the measurement is the normalized projection\nof the state prior to the measurement onto the eigenvector subspace.\nLet A be the observable with eigenvalues ak and eigenvectors |k): A|k) = ak|k). Given a system in the state |ψ), the\nprobability of obtaining ak as the outcome of the measurement of A in this system is\np(ak) = |(k|ψ)|2 .\nWe can also write this in terms of the kth eigenvector projector Pk = |k)(k|: p(ak) = (ψ|Pk |ψ). Since here we are con\nsidering strong, projective measurement, also called Von Neumann measurements, immediately after a measurement\nthat gave us the result ak, the state of the system is in the |k) eigenstate. More precisely, the normalized output\nstate after the measurement is\nPk |ψ)\n|ψ ′ ) =\n.\np\n|(ψ|Pk|ψ)|\nIf we repeat the experiment after the first measurement, we will obtain again the same result (with probability 1).\nIf |ψ) is an eigenstate of A, A|ψ) = aψ|ψ), then we will measure aψ with probability unity. This is the well-known\ncollapse of the wavefunction.\nThe collapse of the wavefunction is of course a source of confusion and contradictions: as stated above it appears\nas an almost instantaneous evolution of the system from a given state to another one, an evolution which is not\nunitary (as evolution should be per axiom # 4). The source of contradiction stems from the fact that in this simple\ndescription of the measurement, the observer (or the measurement apparatus) are external to the system (thus the\nassumption of closed system is not respected) and might not even be quantum-mechanical. A more advanced theory\nof measurement attempts to solve these issues6 .\nOn the other side, we note that operationally the wavefunction collapse is required to define a well-formulated\ntheory. The collapse allows the experimenter to check the result of the measurement by repeating it (on the system\njust observed) thus giving confidence on the measurement apparatus and procedure. If this were not the case, no\nmeasurement could be ever believed to be the correct one, so no confirmation of the theory could be done.\nReference\nM. Brune, E. Hagley, J. Dreyer, X. Matre, A.

To do so we first look at the evolution for an infinitesimal time dt.\nFor an infinitesimal evolution we have then: |ψ(t + dt)) = |ψ) -idtH|ψ). It follows that U(t, dt) = 11\ni\ndt. Since\nthe Hamiltonian is a self-adjoint operator, to the same order of approximation we retrieve the fact that\n-\nU\nH\nis unitary:\nUU + = (11 -iHdt)(11 + iHdt) ≈ 11 + o(dt2).\nWe can build the dynamics for any time duration in terms of infinitesimal evolutions, U(t, t ′ ) = U(t ′ , t ′\ndt) . . . U(t +\n2dt, t + dt)U(t + dt, t) since the propagator U depends only on the time t.\n-\nIf the Hamiltonian is time independent (and setting t ′ = 0), we obtain: ψ(t) = U(0, t) ψ(0) , where the evolution\noperator U is given by U = e-iHt, i.e. U is an exponential operator.\n|\n)\n|\n)\n? Question: Show from the infinitesimal time product and the Taylor expansion for the exponential that this is indeed the\ncase.\nEquivalently, we can find a differential equation for the dynamics of the propagator: from U(t + dt, t0)\nU(t, t0) =\n-i\nKHU(t, t0) we have the Schr odinger equation for the time evolution operator (propagator):\n-\n∂U\niI\n= HU\n∂t\nThis equation is valid also when the Hamiltonian is time-dependent (and we will see later on a formal solution to\nthis equation).\nAs the Hamiltonian represents the energy of the system, its spectral representation is defined in terms of the\nenergL\ny eigenvalues ok, with corresponding eigenvectors k :\n=\nk ok k\nk . The evolution operator is then:\nU =\ne-iokt\n| )\nH\n| )( |\nk\n|k)(k|. The eigenvalues of U are therefore simply e-iok\nL\nt, and it is common to talk in terms of eigen\nphases okt. If the Hamiltonian is time-independent we have also U + = U( t), it is possible to obtain an effective\ninversion of the time arrow.\n-\n? Question: What is the evolution of an energy eigenvector |k)?\nFirst consider the infinitesimal evolution: |k(t + dt)) = U(t + dt, t) |k(t)) = (11 -iHdt) |k(t)) = (1 -iokdt) |k(t)). Thus we have\nthe differential equation for the energy eigenket: d|k) =\niok k , so that k(t) = e -iokt k(0) . We can also use the spectral\ndt\ndecomposition of U: |k(t)) = U(t, 0) |k(0)) = (L e -ioht\n-\n| )\n|\n)\n|\n)\nh\n|h) (h|) |k(0)) = e -iokt |k(0)).\nIn conclusion, our picture of QM is a mathematical framework in which the system is completely described by\nits state, which undergoes a deterministic evolution (and invertible evolution). The measurement process, which\nconnects the mathematical theory to the observed experiments, is probabilistic.\n7 We will quite often set I = 1, that is, we will measure the energies in frequency units\n\n3.3 Strong measurements\n3.3.1 Expectation values\nAlthough the result of a single measurement is probabilistic, we are usually interested in the average outcome, which\ngives us more information about the system and observable. The average or expectation value of an observable for a\nsystem in state |ψ) is given by\n(A) = (ψ|A|ψ)\n? Question: Prove that this can be simply derived from the usual definition of average\nL\nL\nL\nL\n(A) =\np(ak)ak =\n|(ψ|ak)|2 ak =\n(ψ|n)(n|ψ)ak = (ψ|(\nak|k)(k|)|ψ), and we get the desired result from A =\nL\nn\nn\nn\nn\nak|k)(k|.\nn\n3.3.2 Uncertainty relationships\nD: Compatible Observables Two observables A, B are said to be compatible if their corresponding operators commute\n[A, B] = 0 and incompatible otherwise.\nD: Degeneracy If there exist two (or more) eigenstates of an operator A with the same eigenvalues, they are called\ndegenerate.\nWe have already seen how commuting operators have common eigenvectors and how a compatible observables can\nbe used to distinguish between degenerate eigenvectors. We now look from a more physical point of view at the\nmeaning of commuting (or compatible) observables. Suppose we first measure A, given a state |ψ). We retrieve e.g.\nthe eigenvalue a and the state is now projected into the eigenstate |a). Allowing for the presence of degenerate\neigenstates, we actually have a superposition state |ψ)Post-Meas = L\ni\nd\n=1 ci |a, bi), where d is the degree of degeneracy\n\nof the eigenvalue a. We then measure B obtaining one of the bi, b. The state is thus projected into\na, b\n)\n. If we now\nmeasure again A we will retrieve the same result as before: the two measurements of commuting observables A and\nB do not interfere.\n\nConsider now non-commuting observables. As AB|ψ)\nBA|ψ) we cannot define a state\na, b\n)\nwhich is described\n=\nby the (separate) eigenvectors of the two observables. Also, if we repeat the same 3 successive measurements as\nabove, we obtain a different result. In particular, the second measurement of A does not in general retrieve the same\neigenvalue as the first one.\n? Question: Show why measurement of non-commuting observables are not compatible.\nGiven a state |ψ) we measure A, with result a. The state is now projected into the eigenstate |a) as before (we neglect here\ndegeneracy). Now we rewrite this state in the basis of the operator B (which is not the same as the basis for A, so |a) /\n∈{|bi)}):\nL\n|a) =\nci(a) |bi). When we measure B we will therefore obtain an eigenvalue bi with probability |ci(a)|2, and the state is\ni\nPi|a)\n|bi)(bi|a)\nprojected into: √\n=\n= |bi).\n|(a|Pi|a)|\n| |a)(|bi)(bi|)(a| |1/2\nL\nAgain, this can be written as a non-trivial superposition of eigenstates of A: |bi) =\ncj(bi) |aj) so that it is now possible to\nj\nobtain a measurement aj\na when we again measure A.\n=\nD: Variance of an operator. We define an operator ∆A = A -(A) for any observable A. The expectation value of its\nsquare is the variance of A:\n(\n∆A2)\n=\n(\nA2)\n-(A)2 .\n- Theorem: (Uncertainty relation). For any two observables, we have\n(\n∆A2) (\n∆B2)\n≥\n| ([A, B]) |2\n\nFrom Schwartz inequality (|(ψ|φ)|2 ≤(ψ|ψ)(φ|φ)) we have\n(\n∆A2) (\n∆B2)\n≥| (∆A∆B) |2. Now ∆A∆B = 1[∆A, ∆B]+\n1{∆A, ∆B} (where we defined the anticommutator {A, B} = AB + BA). Taking the expectation value (noting that\n2([∆A, ∆B]) = ([A, B])) we have\n(∆A∆B) =\n([A, B]) +\n({∆A, ∆B\n}) .\nNow we can show that [A, B] = iC and\nA, B\n= D where C and D are hermitian operators. Then the first term in\nthe RHS is purely imaginary and the sec\n{\nond p\n}\nurely real. Thus we have:\n(\n\n∆A2) (\n∆B2)\n≥| (∆A∆B) |2 =\n| ([A, B]) |2 +\n| ({∆A, ∆B}) |2 ≥\n| ([A, B]) |2 .\n3.3.3 Repeated measurements and Quantum Zeno Effect\nA. Photon Polarization\nIn the same way an electromagnetic wave can be polarized, also individual photons possess a polarization. In particular\nthey can be in a state of linear or circular polarization (the most general case, is called elliptical polarization). We\nconsider a photon polarizer. This can be thought as a filter that ensures photons coming out of it are only of the\nright polarization.\n-- In-class demonstration with polarizer filters --\nThe photon polarizer (a polarization filter) is very similar to a measurement process and indeed it can be described by\na projector. Let's assume that light can be described as either being in the horizontal h or vertical v polarization.\nThen , for an horizontal polarizer, for example, we have P\n= h\nh . If we send a ph\n|\no\n)\nH\n| ) ( |\nton in the st\n|\nat\n)\ne ψ through\nthis linear (horizontal) polarizer, its state after the polarizer will be h . However the photon will emerg\n|\ne\n)\nonly with\na probability |(h |ψ) |2. If we then send the photon to an orthogonal (\n|\nve\n)\nrtical) polarizer PV = |v) (v|, the probability\nof a photon coming out is just zero. This situation is very similar to the case of repeated measurement. Thus the\npolarizer is a measurement process.\nNow let's send an horizontally polarized photon (|h)) through a 45 degrees polarizer. This polarizer can be described\nby the projector operator P45 = |h + v) (h + v| /2. The state after the polarizer is then ( h + v /\n√\n2, and the proba\nbility of coming out is 1. If now we send this photon through a v\nv polarizer, we obt\n|\nain as\n)\na final state v , and\nthe total probability is 1/4 (compare to zero before).\n| ) ( |\n| )\nWe can extend this even further. Assume we have a large number of polarizers each ensuring a polarization at a\ngrowing angle, each in a small step θ with the horizontal (that is, the first polarizer's angle is θ, the second 2θ etc.).\nThe relevant projector is then\nPn(θ) = (cos(nθ) |h) + sin(nθ) |v))(cos(nθ) (h| + sin(nθ) (v|).\nWe start with a photon horizontally polarized |ψ)0 = |h). After the first polarizer, the photon emerges through in the\nstate |ψ) = cos θ |h)+sin θ |v) with probability p (θ) = |(cos θ (h|+sin θ (v|) |h) |2 = cos2\nθ. Now passing through the\nsecond polarizer the photon will emerge again with probability cos2 θ and in the state ψ 1 = cos(2θ) h +sin(2θ) v .\nAfter n polarizers, the state of the emerging photon is\n| )\n| )\n| )\n|ψ)n = cos(nθ) |h) + sin(nθ) |v) .\nOf course, we could get no photon at all, however the combined probability of getting a photon is cos(θ)2n\n1 if\nthe angle θ is small and the number of polarizer n is large. Thus we obtain an evolution of the system by us\n≈\ning a\nmeasurement process.\nB. Quantum Zeno effect\nWe consider a photon polarization rotator, whose action is to rotate the polarization about the propagation axis. By\ndenoting {h, v} the horizontal and vertical polarization, respectively, the polarization rotator achieves the following\ntransformation:\n\na)\n0 θ 2θ 3θ\n...\nnθ\nP R P R P R P R\nb)\nFig. 1: a) Rotation by measurement. b) Quantum Zeno effect\n|h) →cos(θ)|h) + sin(θ)|v\n|v) →cos(θ)\n)\n|v) -sin(θ)|h)\nThis corresponds to the evolution matrix U:\n\ncos(θ)\nsin(θ)\nU =\n-sin(θ)\ncos(θ)\n\n? Question: What are the eigenstates of U?\nBy diagonalizing the matrix, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to right and left polarization:\nR = (\n√\n|h) + i |v))/ 2\nL = (-i |h\n√\n) + |v))/ 2\nWith eigenvalues e iθ and e -iθ respectively. The evolution given by the polarization rotator is unitary.\nNow assume another experiment in which we alternate a polarizer rotator and an horizontal polarizer. First consider\njust a set of polarizer rotators, each described by the formula above:\n\ncos(θ)\nsin(θ)\nU(θ) =\n-sin(θ)\ncos(θ)\n\nAfter n of these rotators, the photon is rotated to U(θ)n h\n= U(nθ) h\n= cos(nθ) h + sin(nθ) v . Now if we\nalternate with the horizontal polarizer, every time the photo\n|\nn\n)\nis transmit\n|\nted\n)\nwith proba\n|\nbilit\n)\ny cos2 θ a\n|\nnd\n)\nrotate back\nto |h). Again for θ small, the probability of a photon emerging tends to 1, and the final state of the photon is h .\nThis is a phenomenon called quantum Zeno effect8 or we can call it a \"watched milk never boils\" phenomenon. T\n|\nh\n)\ne\nrepeated measurements inhibit a (slow) evolution.\nReferences\n- B. Misra and E. C. G. Sudarshan, The Zeno's paradox in quantum theory J. Math. Phys. 18, 756 (1977).\n- W. M. Itano, D.

A neutron in an interferometer,\ntaking either the upper or lower path. A photon linearly polarized either horizontally or vertically. A two level system\n(TLS) is the simplest system in quantum mechanics, but it already illustrates many characteristics of QM and it\ndescribes as well many physical systems. It is common to reduce or map quantum problems onto a TLS. We pick the\nmost important states -the ones we care about- and then discard the remaining degrees of freedom, or incorporate\nthem as a collection or continuum of other degrees of freedom termed a bath.\nIn a more abstract way, we can think of a TLS as carrying a binary information (the absence or presence of something,\nthe information about a position, such as left or right, or up or down, etc.). Thus a TLS can be thought as containing\na bit of information. By analogy with classical computers and information theory, TLS are thus called qubits. Their\nbasis states are usually defined as |0) and |1) with a vector representation:\n|0) =\n[\n]\n, |1) =\n[\n]\nA general state is then |ψ) = α|0) + β|1). If it is normalized we have |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. Then, this state can also be\nwritten quite generally in terms of the two angles θ and φ:\n|ψ) = cos(θ/2)|0) + e iφ sin(θ/2)|1)\nFor this state, the probability of finding the system in the 0[1] state is cos2 (θ/2) [sin2(θ/2)]. Notice that I could have\nwritten the state also as\n|ψ) ≡|φ) = e -iφ/2 cos(θ/2)|0) + eiφ/2 sin(θ/2)|1)\nThe two states are in fact equivalent up to a global phase factor. While relative phase factors (in a superposition)\nare very important, global phases are irrelevant, since they yield the same results in a measurement outcome.\n? Question: Show that a global phase factor does not change measurement outcomes and measurement statistics.\n1.(Measurement outcome) As the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of the measurement operators, the first\nis trivially true.\n2.(Statistics) Let's consider an observable A with eigenvectors |a) = a0|0) + a1|1) corresponding to the eigenvalues a, then\nthe probability of obtaining a from the measurement is p(a) = 1(ψ|a)12 = |a0 cos (θ/2) + a1e iφ sin(θ/2)|2 = 1(φ|a)12 =\n-iφ/2\niφ/2\n|a0e\ncos θ/2 + a1e\nsin θ/2|2 .\n\nConsider for example a = ( 0 + 1 )/\n√\n| )\n| )\n| )\n2. Then we obtain p(a) = 1(1 + cos φ sin θ). Thus the relative phase of 0\nw.r.t. |1) is important. But a global phase multiplying the state is not.\n| )\nFig. 2: Bloch sphere representation of a qubit (TLS) [From wikipedia]\nDescribing a TLS via the two angles θ and φ leads to a simple geometrical picture for the space occupied by this\nsystem. The angles define a point on a sphere of radius 1, which is called Bloch sphere. The TLS can then assume\nany of the points on the surface of the sphere via a unitary transformation (in the following, we will also interested\nin the points inside the sphere, as well as means to reach them). The unitary evolution for this particular system\ncan then be described as rotations of the state vector in the sphere.\nUsing the example of a TLS we are thus going to introduce the concept of rotation and angular momentum, which\ncan be generalized also to larger systems.\n4.2 Rotations and angular momentum\n4.2.1 Classical rotations\nLet's review rotation in classical mechanics (geometry). The first property that we want to analyze is the fact that\nsuccessive rotations about different axes do not commute. Consider for example to start with a vector aligned along\nthe z axis and then effectuate two rotations, one about the y axis and one about the z axis. Depending on the order,\nwe obtain a rotation or no rotation at all.\nRotation are represented in 3D by orthogonal 3\n3 matrices. (an orthogonal matrix is such that RRT = RT R = 11.\nIn particular, rotations about the 3 axes are as f\n×\nollow:\n\nR\n=\nx(φ)\ncos(φ)\n-sin(φ)\nsin(φ)\ncos(φ)\n\ncos(φ)\nsin(φ)\nR\n\ny(φ) =\n\n-sin(φ)\ncos(φ)\n\ncos(φ)\n\nz(\ns\n-sin(φ)\nR\n=\n\nφ)\nin(φ)\ncos(φ)\n\nIt is easy then to show that Rα(θ)Rβ (φ) = Rβ (φ\n\n)Rα(θ) unless α = β. W\n\nhat about if the rotation angles are very\nsmall? We might expect then that the order matters less. We thus consider infinitesimal rotations, where φ = o → 0:\nB\nl\no\nc\nh\n\ns\nphere representation of a qubit.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nR\n(o) ≈\n\no2\n1 -\n-o\n\nx\no2\no\n1 - 2\n\no2\no\nR (o) =\n- 2\ny\no2\n\n-o\n1 - 2\n\no2\n1 -\n-o\nR\n\n(o) =\n-\n\no\no2\nz\n\nIf we then calculate for example R\n\nx(o)Ry (o) -Ry(o)Rx(o) we obtain:\n\no2\n1 -\no\n\no2\no2\no 1\no\nRx(o)Ry (o) =\n\n-\n-\n(\n-\n(\n)\n(\n)2\n\no 1\n)\n-\n-o\no\n1 -o\n\n1 -\no\no\no3\no\n- 2\no2\nRy(o)Rx(o) =\n1 -\n\no\n-\n-o\n1 -o2\no - o\n\nand\n\n(\n)\n\n-o2\no3\nRx(o)Ry (o) -\n\nRy(o)Rx(o) =\n\no3\no2\n\no\no3\n\nThus we see that\n\n1. If we ignored terms ∝ o2 and higher, the rotations do commute.\n2. At the second order in o we can write the result as Rx(o)Ry(o) -Ry(o)Rx(o) = R\nz(o )\n11. This result stands\nalso for cyclic permutations of the subscripts. These commutation relationships are a guide\n-\nin finding commutation\nrelationships that the equivalent QM rotation operators should obey.\n4.2.2 QM angular momentum as generator of rotations\nIn QM we can as well define rotations, as we already did for classical mechanics. Although we will first study\nexamples for TLS, rotations can be defined for any system (even higher dimensional systems). Generally, a rotation\nwill be represented by an operator D(Rα(φ)) associated to a classical rotation Rα(φ). We first define the action of an\ninfinitesimal rotation. To do so we define the angular momentum operator J in terms of the infinitesimal rotation :\nD(Rn(δφ)) = 1\nJ\n1 -iδφJ · Jn\nwhere Jn is a unit vector. A finite rotation can be found by repeating many infinitesimal rotations. For example, for\na rotation about z:\nφ N\nD(Rz (φ)) = lim\nh\n11 -iJz\ni\n= 11\nN\n-iJzφ -\nJ2φ2\nz\n· · · = exp (\n→inf\nN\n-iJzφ)\n(Note that here again I took I = 1.) The angular momentum can thus be considered as the generator of rotations.\n\nA. Rotations properties\n- Identity: ∃11 : 11D =\n- Closure:\nis als\nD11 =\no a rot\nD\nation\n3.\n- Inverse:\nD D\n∃ and inverse such that\nD\nDD-1 = 11\n- Associativity (D1D2)D3 = D1(D2D3)\nB. Commutation\nIn analogy with the classical case, we can write the commutation for the infinitesimal rotations:\nDx(o)Dy(o) -Dy(o)Dx(o)\n= (11 -iJxo -\nJ2o2\nx\n)(\n11 -iJyo -\nJ2 2\n2 2\ny o ) -(11 -iJyo -\nJyo )(11 -iJxo -\nJxo ) = -(JxJy -JyJx)o + O(o )\nand equate this to D\nz (o ) -11 = -iJzo2. With this analogy we justify the definition of angular momentum operators\nas operators that generate the rotations and obey the commutation relationships:\n[J\nI\ni, Jj ] = i oijkJk\nC. Spin- 1\nAlthough angular momentum operators have some classical analogy, they are more general, as they describe for\nexample physical properties that have no classical counterparts, such as the spin. In particular, the lowest dimension\nin which the commutation relationships above hold is 2. The angular momentum S for a TLS is represented by the\noperators:\nSx = 1σ\nx =\n(|0)h1 +\n|\n|1)h0|)\nS\ni\ny =\nσy =\n(|0)h1| -|1)h0\n|)\nSz =\nσz =\n(|0)h0| -|1)h1\n|)\nwhere {σx, σy, σz } are called Pauli operators or Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices have the following properties:\n1. σ2\nα = 11\n2. σiσj + σj σi = 0, that is, they anticommute.\n3. σiσj = -σj σi = iσk (from the previous property)\n4. Hermiticity: σi\n+\n= σi\n5. Zero trace: Tr σi\n= 0\n6. Determinant d\n{\net(σ\n}\ni) = -1.\n? Question: Show that S satisfies the commutation relationship.\n1. Show it by multiplying the operators.\n2. Write down the matrix form and perform matrix multiplications.\nWe can now check what is the action of the spin operators on the TLS state vector |ψ) = α|0) + β|1):\nσx|ψ) = α|1 + β 0\nσy |ψ) = iα|1\n)\n| )\n) -iβ|0\nσ\n)\nz |ψ) = α|0) -β|1)\nin particular, σx swap the two components (spin flip) and σz invert the sign of the |1) component (phase shift), while\nσy does both.\n\nD. Spin- 1 rotations\nWe can now look at rotations of spin- 1 . In particular we want to calculate Dα(φ) = e-iSαφ. For this we remember\nthe property: σ2\nα = 11. With this, and using a Taylor expansion it is easy to show that we have\ne -iSαφ = cos (φ/2)11 -i sin (φ/2)Sα\n?

In particular we notice that the polarization rotator is\nrepresented by rotation operators, in particular rotations around the x-axis e-iθSx.\nConsider another very simple system, a neutron interferometer, such as the Mach-Zehnder interferometer.\n|U〉\n|L〉\nBS\nBS\nFig. 3: Neutron Interferometer\nWe send in a beam of neutrons. The first beamsplitter divides the neutron flux into two parts, that will go into the\nupper arm or the lower arm. Thus the state of the system is at this point in time\n|ψ)\n1 = α |U) + β |L) , α + β = 1\nWe assume that the flux of neutrons is so low (neutrons can be very slow) so that only one neutron is present at\nany time inside the interferometer. The lower and upper beams are then reflected at the mirrors and recombined at\nthe second beam splitter, after which the neutron flux is measured at one arm. If we assume that both beamsplitter\nworks in the same way, delivering √ an equal flux to each arm (that is, the transmission and reflection are the same),\nthen we have |ψ)1 = (|U) + |L))/ 2 and |ψ)2 = |U).\n? Question: What is th√e propagator describing the action of the Beamsplitter?\nUBS |U) = (|U) + |L))/ 2 and we also know that UBS(|U) +\n√\n|L))/ 2 = |U). We can verify that\nUBS = √\n-1\n\nperforms as we want. In particular, notice that UBSUBS = 11.\nThus, if our observable is the number of neutron in the upper arm, the measurement always returns 1 with certainty (probability\n=1 ).\nLet's now consider the case in which we want to measure at point 1 how many neutrons are in the upper arm. The observable\nis just the projector onto the upper arm Ob = PU = |U) (U| and we will detect one neutron (or zero neutrons) with probability\n\n. In fact p(U) = 1(ψ|U)12 =\n. Also, the average value of the number of neutron in the upper arm is 1/2 as well, since\n\n(Ob) = |(ψ|P\nU|ψ)| =\nAfter the measurement, the state is projected onto the upper arm, if we did detect a photon, or the\nlower arm, otherwise. We assume that the neutron is free to continue on its path after the measurement and we perform a\nsecond measurement after the second beamsplitter.\n? Question: What is the probability of me√ asuring 1 neutron in the upper part in this case?\nNow the state at 2 is |ψ)2 = (|U) ± |L))/ 2, hence p(U) = (ψ|U) = 1.\n4.2.4 Spinor behavior\n\nBy calculating e-iSαφSβeiSαφ we see that the rotations of the operator give the following result:\nS\nS\nz\nx → Sx cos(φ) -Sy sin(φ),\nS\nS\nz\ny → Sy cos(φ) + Sx sin(φ),\nS\nS\nz\nz → Sz\nThese are the same rotation rules we would have expected classically. In particular, taking the expectation values, we\nsee that they correspond exactly to the rotations in 3D of a vector, with a periodicity of 2π. Things are a bit different\n(and more surprising) if we consider instead the state rotation. Consider the rotation of the state ψ = α 0 + β 1\nwith respect to S\n| )\n| )\n| )\nz:\ne -iJzφ|ψ) = e-iφ/2α|0) + eiφ/2β|1),\nnow the angle of rotation seems to be φ/2. This has an interesting consequence: if we rotate by φ = 2π instead\nof returning to the initial state, as we would have expected, we obtain e-iJz2π ψ\n=\nψ . This is the so-called\nspinor behavior. Notice that from a simple measurement this minus sign (which\n|\nis\n)\nequiv\n-\na\n|\nle\n)\nnt to a global phase) is\nirrelevant, hence we obtain the same expectation values for the angular momenta as before. We will see in P-Set on\nthat experiments can be devised to show the spinor behavior (but they need to use more than one spin).\n4.2.5 The SU(2) and SO(3) groups\nA group G is a finite or infinite set of elements together with a binary operation (called the group operation)\nthat together satisfy the four fundamental properties of closure, associativity, the identity property, and the inverse\nproperty. A rotation group is a group in which the elements are orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. In the\ncase of three-dimensional space, the rotation group is known as the special orthogonal group or SO(3)9. The special\nunitary group SU(2) is the set of 2 by 2 unitary matrices with determinant +1 [it is a subgroup of the unitary group\nU(2)]. The two groups SO(3) and SU(2) both represent rotations, however there is a one-to-two correspondence for\na given R ∈ SO(3) there are 2 U ∈ SU(2). This is because a 2π and 4π rotations are the same in SO(3) but they are\n11 and -11 in SU(2).\n9 For a more rigorous and extensive explanation see J.J.

The evolution operator is then:\nU =\nk e-\n|k)(k|. The eigenvalues of U are therefore simply e-\n, and it is common to talk in terms of eigen\nphases φk(t) = okt. If the Hamiltonian is time-independent we have also U + = U( t), it is possible to obtain an\neffective inversion of the time arrow.\n-\n? Question: What is the evolution of an energy eigenvector |k)?\nFirst consider the infinitesimal evolution: |k(t + dt)) = U(t + dt, t) |k(t)) = (11 -iHdt) |k(t)) = (1 -iokdt) |k(t)). Thus we have\nthe differential equation for the energy eigenket: d|k) = -iok |k), so that |k(t)) = e -iokt\ndt\n|k(0)).\nWe can also use the spectral decomposition of U: |k(t)) = U(t, 0) |k(0)) = (L\nh e -ioht |h) (h|) |k(0)) = e -iokt |k(0)).\nNotice that if a system is in a state given by an eigenvector of the Hamiltonian, then the system does not evolve.\nThis is because the state will only acquire a global phase that, as seen, does not change its properties. Of course,\nsuperposition of energy eigenkets do evolve.\n5.1 The Schro dinger and Heisenberg pictures\nUntil now we described the dynamics of quantum mechanics by looking at the time evolution of the state vectors.\nThis approach to quantum dynamics is called the Schr odinger picture. We can easily see that the evolution of the\n\nstate vector leads to an evolution for the expectation values of the observables (which are the relevant physical\nquantities we are interested in and have access to).\nFrom the evolution law for a state, |ψ) →|ψ ′ ) = U|ψ), we obtain the following relation, when expressing the state\nin the Hamiltonian eigenbasis:\n\n|ψ)\n\n=\nX\n\nck |o\ni\nt\niokt\nk\nk\n) →|ψ ′ ) = e -H |ψ) =\nX\ncke -\n|ok\nk\n)\nThen the expectation value of an observable A evolves as:\n\nhA) =\nX\nc∗\nkcj hok| A |oj ) →\nX\nck\n∗cj hok| A |oj ) e -i(oj-ok)t\nk,j\nk,j\nQuite generally, we can also write\nA(t)\n=\nψ(t) A ψ(t)\n=\n(Uψ) A Uψ .

U and H always com\ndt\nmute for time-independent H, thus HH = H.\n5.2 Interaction Picture\nWe now consider yet another \"picture\" that simplifies the description of the system evolution in some special cases.\nIn particular, we consider a system with an Hamiltonian\nH = H0 + V\nwhere\ncalcula\nH0 is a \"solvable\" Hamiltonian (of which we already know the eigen-decomposition, so that it is easy to\nte e.g. U\n-iH0 t\n0 = e\n) and V is a perturbation that drives an interesting (although unknown) dynamics. In the\nso-called interaction picture the state is represented by\n|ψ) = U (t)+|ψ)\n= e iH0 t\nI\nS\n|ψ)S\nwhere the subscript I, S indicate the interaction and Schr odinger picture respectively. For the observable operators\nwe can define the corresponding interaction picture operators as:\nAI (t) = U0\n+ AS U0 → VI (t) = U0\n+V U0\nWe can now derive the differential equation governing the evolution of the state in the interaction picture (we now\ndrop the subscript S for the usual Schr odinger picture):\n∂ψ I\n∂(U + ψ )\n∂U +\n∂ψ\ni | )\n= i\n0| ) = i(\nψ + U + | )) =\nU +\n0 ψ + U +(\n0 + V ) ψ = U +V ψ .\n∂t\n∂t\n∂t | )\n0 ∂t\n-\n0H | )\n0 H\n| )\n| )\n\nInserting the identity 11 = U0U0\n+, we obtain\n∂|ψ)I\ni\n= U +V U U +\n\n0|ψ) = VI |ψ)I .\n∂t\nThis is a Schr odinger -like equation for the vector in the interaction picture, evolving under the action of the operator\nVI only. However, in contrast to the usual Schr odinger picture, even the observables in the interaction picture evolve\nin time. From their definition AI (t) = U0\n+AS U0, we have the differential equation\ndAI = i[\n0, AI ], which is an\ndt\nHeisenberg-like equation for the observable, with the total Hamiltonian replaced by\nH\nH0. The interaction picture is\nthus an intermediate picture between the two other pictures.\nS\nH\nI\n|ψ)\nX\n×\nX\nA\n×\nX\nX\nTable 1: Time dependence of states and operators in the three pictures\n5.2.1 Dyson Time-ordering operator\nIf we now want to solve the state-vector differential equation in terms of a propagator |ψ(t))I = UI (t) |ψ)I , we\nencounter the problem that the operator VI is usually time-dependent since VI (t) = U0\n+ V U0, thus in general UI =\ne-iVIt. We can still write an equation for the propagator in the interaction picture\ndUI\ni\n= VI (t)U\n\nI\ndt\nwith initial condition UI (0) = 11. When VI is time dependent and VI (t) does not commute at different time, it\nis no longer possible to find a simple explicit expression for UI (t). Indeed we could be tempted to write UI (t) =\nJ t\ne-i\nVI(t′ )dt′\n. However in general\neAe B\nA+B\n= e\nif [A, B] = 0,\nthus for example, although we know that UI (t) can be written as UI (t, 0) = UI (t, t ⋆)UI (t ⋆ , 0) (∀0 < t ⋆ < t) we have\nthat J\n⋆\n⋆\n-i\nt\nV (t ′ )dt ′\nI\n-i\ne\nJ t V (t ′\nI\n)dt′\n⋆\n\nt\n= e-i\nJ t V (t ′ )dt ′\n-i\nJ t\nV (t ′ )dt ′\n⋆\nI\nI\nt\ne\n. Thus we cannot find an explicit solution in terms of an\nintegral.\nWe can however find approximate solutions or formal solution to the evolution.\nThe differential equation is equivalent to the integral equation\nt\nUI (t) = 11 -i\nVI (t ′ )UI (t ′ )dt ′\nBy iterating, we can find a formal solution to this equation :\nt\nt\nt′\nUI (t) = 11 -i\ndt′ VI (t ′ ) + (-i)2\ndt ′\ndt ′ VI (t ′ )VI (t ′′ ) + . . .\n1 t\n1 t(n-1)\n+(-i)n\ndt ′ . . .\ndt(n)VI (t ′ ) . . .

We then define an operator T such that when applied to a product of two\noperators it will return their time-ordered product:\n\nA(t)B(t ′ ),\nif t < t ′\nT (A(t)B(t ′ )) =\n{\nB(t ′ )A(t),\nif t ′ < t\n\nNow we can rewrite the expression above in a more compact way. We replace the limits of each intervals so that\nthey span the whole duration {0, t} and we divide by n! to take into account that we integrate over a larger interval.\nThen we can write the products of integrals as powers and use the time-ordering operator to take this change into\naccount.

U(t2, t1)U(t1, t0),\nt0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tn-1 < t,\nwhere we usually take tk -tk-1 = δt and consider the Hamiltonian H to be constant during each of the small time\ninterval δt.\nC. Magnus expansion\nThe Magnus expansion is a perturbative solution to the exponential of a time-varying operator (for example the\npropagator of a time-varying Hamiltonian). The idea is to define an effective time-independent Hamiltonian by\nJ\n-i\ndt ′ H(t\ntaking: U = T e\nt\n′ ) ≡ e-itH . The effective Hamiltonian is then expanded in a series of terms of increasing\n(0)\n(1)\n(2)\norder in time H = H\n+ H\n+ H\n+ . . ., so that\n(0)\n(1)\n(2)\nU = exp{-it[H\n+ H\n+ H\n+ . . .]}\nJ\n-i\ndt ′ H(t\nwhere the terms can be found by expanding T e\nt\n′ ) and equating terms of the same time power. In order to\nkeep the time order, commutators are then introduced.

Phys. 51, 183-190 (1976)\n\n5.3 Spin- 1\n2 precession\nWe consider the semi-classical problem of a spin-1/2 particle in a classical magnetic field. To each spin with spin\nangular momentum J is associated a magnetic moment μ = γS where γ is called the gyromagnetic ratio, a property\nof each spin-carrying particle (nucleus, electron, etc.). The energy of the system in an external mangetic field is\n(classically) given by μ· B, where B is of course the field. Thus, the system Hamiltonian is simply\n= γBzSz = ωSz,\nwhere we take the z axis to point along the external field for simplicity and we defined the Larmo\nH\nr frequency for the\ngiven system.\nIf the spin is initially in the state |0), the system does not evolve (as it is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian). If instead\nit is prepared in a superposition state, it will undergo an evolution.\n|ψ0) = α0|0) + β0|1) →|ψ(t)) = α(t)|0) + β(t)|1)\n? Question: What are the functions α(t), β(t)?\n1. As |0), |1) are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with eigenvalues ±ω/2, we know that their evolution is just a phase e ±iωt/2,\nso that α(t) = α\n-iωt/2\n+iωt/2\n0e\nand β(t) = β0e\n.\n2. |ψ(t)) = U(t) |ψ(0)), with U = e -iHt = e -iωSzt = 11 cos (ωt/2) -i sin (ωt/2) 2Sz. Then U(t)|0) = (cos ωt/2 -i sin ωt/2)|0) =\ne -iωt/2|0) and we find the same result.\n? Question: What is the probability of finding the spin back to its initial state?\n\nLet's write the initial state as |ψ)0 = cos(θ/2)|0)+eiφ/2 sin(θ/2)|1). Then the evolution is eiωt/2 cos(θ/2)|0)+e i(ωt+φ)/2 sin(θ/2)|1\n\n)\nand the probability p = cos 2 (ωt/2) + cos θ2 sin2 (ωt/2) In particular, for θ = π/4 we have cos2 (ωt/2) (notice that this is an\neigenstate of the Sx operator).\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\ntime\nFig. 4: Spin precession: probability of being in the initial state\n? Question: What is the evolution of the magnetization in the x direction?\nWe want to calculate (Sx(t)). We can use the Heisenberg picture, and calculate U +SxU = Sx cos (ωt)-Sy sin (ωt). Thus we see\nthat the periodicity is T = 2\nω\nπ while it was 4\nω\nπ for the spin state (spinor behavior). Then we know that (Sx) = cos(φ/2) sin(θ)\nand (Sy) = sin(φ/2) sin(θ) from which we find (Sx(t)) = cos(φ/2 + ωt) sin(θ)\nProbability of initial state\nCos Θ 0\nCos Θ Π 4\nCos Θ Π 2\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance\nThe evolution of the magnetization is what is usually detected in NMR. The precession of the spin in a large static\nmagnetic field creates an oscillating magnetic field that in turns generate a current/voltage in a pickup coil. Fourier\ntransform of the signal gives spectroscopic information regarding the Larmor frequency; local modification of the\nmagnetic field (due e.g. to electronic field) induces a variation on the Larmor frequency of each nuclear spin in a\nmolecule, thus providing a way to investigate the structure of the molecule itself. Before we can have a full vision of\na (simple) NMR experiment, we still need to answer the question on how we first prepare the spin in a superposition\nstate (e.g. in a Sx eigenstate). We will be able to answer this question in a minute.\n\n5.4 Examples: Resonance of a Two-Level System\nWe have looked at the precession of the spin at the Larmor frequency, which happens if the spin is initially in a\nsuperposition state. However, the question remained on how we rotate initially the spin away from its equilibrium\nstate pointing along the large external magnetic field. Consider then a more general problem in which we add a\n(small) time-dependent magnetic field along the transverse direction (e.g. x-axis):\nB(t) = Bzzˆ + 2B1 cos(ωt)ˆx = Bz zˆ + B1 [(cos(ωt)ˆx + sin(ωt)ˆy) + (cos(ωt)ˆx -sin(ωt)ˆy)] ,\nwhere B1 is the strength of the radio-frequency (for nuclei) or microwave (for electron) field.\nThe Hamiltonian of the system H = H0 + H1(t) + H1\n′ (t) is then:\nω0\nω1\nω1\nH =\nσz +\n[cos(ωt)σx + sin(ωt)σy ] +\n[cos(ωt)σx -sin(ωt)σy] ,\nwhere we defined the rf frequency ω1. We already know the eigenstates of H0 (|0) and |1)). Thus we use the\n-iωσz\ninteraction picture to simplify the Hamiltonian, with U0 = e\n/2 defining a frame rotating about the z-axis\n+\nat a frequency ω: this is the so-called rotating frame. Remembering that U0σxU\n= cos(ωt)σx + sin(ωt)σy , it's\neasy to see that the perturbation Hamiltonian in the interaction frame is H1I = U +H1U0 = ω\n1 σx. We also have\n+\nω\nH ′\n= U H1\n′ U0 =\n1I\n1 (cos(2ωt)σx -sin(2ωt)σy). Under the assumptions that ω1 ≪ ω, this is a small, fast oscillating\nterm, that quickly averages out during the evolution of the system and thus can be neglected. This approximation is\ncalled the rotating wave approximation (RWA). Under the RWA, the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame simplifies to\n∆ω\nω1\nHI =\nσz +\nσx\nwhere ∆ω = ω0 -ω. Notice that if ∆ω is large (≫ ω1), we expect that the eigenstates of the systems are still going\nto be close to the eigenstates of H0 and the small perturbation has almost no effect. Only when ω ≈ ω0 we will see\na change: this is the resonance condition. In particular, for ∆ω = 0 the new Hamiltonian ∼ σx will cause a spin\ninitially in, say, |0) to rotate away from the z axis and toward the y axis. This is how a \"pulse\" is generated e.g. in\nNMR or ESR pulsed spectroscopy. For example, if the B1 field is turned on for a time tπ/2 = π/2ω1 we prepare the\n√\nstate |ψ) = (|0) -i|1))/ 2 that will then precess at the Larmor frequency, giving a spectroscopic signature in the\nrecorded signal.\nWe want to study the Hamiltonian in the general case. Given the matrix representation\n1 (\n∆ω\nω1\n)\nHI = 2\nω1\n-∆ω\nwe can find the eigenvalues:\n∆ω\nωI = ±\nV\n1 + (ω1/∆ω)2 .\nThere are two interesting limits, on resonance (∆ω = 0) where ωI = ω1 and far off resonance (∆ω ≫ ω1) where\nωI ≈ ∆ω ∼ ω0.

The evolution of an atom in an e.m. field (here we are\nconsidering a classical e.m. field, but we will see that we can also consider the quantized version) is usually described\nwith the dressed atom picture. This picture (due to Cohen-Tannoudji) describes the atom as dressed by a cloud of\nvirtual photons, with which it interacts.\nThis atomic TLS has (unperturbed) eigenstates |e) = |0) and |g) = |1) with energies E0 - E1 = ∆ω, which are\ncoupled through an interaction ω1/2. When we consider the optical transition of an atom we usually call ω1 the Rabi\nfrequency.\n± ∆ω\nThe coupling mixes these states, giving two new eigenstates as seen before with energies ±ωI =\nV\n1 + (ω1/∆ω)2 ,\nwhich is called the effective Rabi frequency.\nΔω\nΔω+ ω1\n2Δω2\nFig. 6: Energy shift for small coupling perturbation\n\nω2\nIf the coupling is small, we can treat it as a perturbation, and the energies are just shifted by an amount δE =\n4∆ω .\n\n′\n∆ω\nω2\nThat is, the new energies are E =\n(1 +\n2 ). This shift in the context of a two-level atom dressed by the e.m.\n2∆ω\nfield is called the AC Stark shift. It is a quadratic effect that can be seen also as arising (in a more general context)\nfrom second order perturbation theory.\nThe perturbed energies are shown in the following diagram. Here we explore the range of the eigenvalues\nωI =\nfound before, given a fixed value of the coupling ω1 and a varying splitting ∆ω between the two levels. In r\n±\ned are\nthe two perturbed energies, while the dashed lines follow the unperturbed energies. For ∆ω = 0, in the absence of\na coupling term, the two eigenstate are degenerate. The perturbation lifts this degeneracy, giving rise to an avoided\ncrossing. The eigenstates are a complete mix of the unperturbed states, yet remain split in energy by the strength\nof interaction ω1.\n\n-3\n-2\n-1\n-1.5\n-1.0\n-0.5\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nFig. 7: Dressed atom energies as a function of the splitting ∆ω showing the avoided crossing\n5.5 The wave-function\nWe have so far considered systems associated to observables with a discrete spectrum. That is, the system can assume\nonly a discrete number of states (for example 2, for the TLS) and the possible outcomes of an experiments are a\ndiscrete set of values. Although for the first part of the class this is all that we'll need, it's important to introduce as\nwell systems with a continuous set of states, as they lead to the concept of a particle's wave function12. This is an\nessential concept in non-relativistic QM that you might has seen before (and probably as one of the very first topics\nin QM).\n5.5.1 Position representation\nThe state |ψ) of a point-like particle is naturally expanded onto the basis made of the eigenstates of the particle's\nposition vector operator R. Of course the position of a point particle is a continuous variable (more precisely a vector\nwhose components are the three commuting coordinate operators X, Y and Z). The rigorous mathematics definition\nof these continuous basis states is somewhat complex, so we will skip some of the details to instead obtain a practical\ndescription of the wave function. The basis states |r) satisfy the relations generalizing the orthonormality conditions:\nhr| r ′ ) = δ(r -r ′ ),\nd3 r |r) hr| = 1\nwhere δ(r -r ′ ) is the three-dimensional Dirac function. Developing |ψ) in the |r) basis yields:\n|ψ) =\nd3 r |r) hr| ψ)\nwhere we define the wave function (in the position representation)\nψ(r) = hr| ψ)\nThe shape of the wave function depends upon the physical situation under consideration. we may say that the\nwave function describes the state of the particle suspended, before measurement, in a continuous superposition\nof an infinite number of possible positions. Upon measurement of R performed with a linear precision δr, this\nsuperposition collapses into a small wave packet of volume (δr)3 around a random position r, with the probability\np(r) = | hr| ψ)|2(δr)3 .\n5.5.2 Momentum representation\nThe position representation is suited for measurements of the particle's position. If one is interested in the particle\nmomentum P or velocity V = P/m (where m is the particle mass) it is appropriate to choose the momentum\n12 For a nice introduction to these concepts, see S.

We start from the lower powers:\n\n[x , p] = x[x, p] + [x, p]x = 2i\n3 p] = x[x 2\nnx;\n[x ,\n, p] + [x, p]x 2 = 3i\nn\nnx ;\n[x , p] = ni\nn-1\nnx\nLet's now consider any function of x and its commutator with p. Since by definition we can expand the function in a power\nseries, it is easy to calculate the commutator:\nn\n\n∂f(x)\n[f(x), p] =\nX\nf (n)(0)/n![x n , p] =\nX\nf (n)(0)\ni\nn-1\nnx\n= in\nn!\n∂x\nn\nn\nNotice that this is also true for the wave function: [pˆx, ψp(x)] = -in∂xψp(x) = pˆ(x|p) -(x|p)pˆ = pψp(x) from which, solving\n-ip\nx/n\nthe differential equation, (p |x) = e\nx\nx\n: 1/2 (where the denominator is chosen to have a normalized function).\n(2π )\n\n5.5.3 Schro dinger equation for the wavefunction\nWe have studied already the law governing the evolution of a quantum system. We saw that the dynamics of the\nsystem is generated by the system Hamiltonian H (the observable corresponding to the total energy of the system),\nas described by Schr odinger equation:\nind|ψ) = H|ψ)\ndt\nWe can express this same equation in the position representation. We want to describe the evolution of a point\nP 2\nparticle in a potential V (r) and with kinetic energy T =\n. The Hamiltonian of this simple system is thus given by\n2m\np\nH = V (r) +\n. By multiplying the Schr odinger equation with the bra hr| we obtain:\n2m\nindhr|ψ)\nP 2\n= in∂tψ(r) = hr| H|ψ) = hr| V (r)|ψ) + hr|\n|ψ)\ndt\n2m\nUsing the relationship\n2 ∂2ψ(x, t)\nhx| P 2|ψ) = (P 2ψ)(x, t) = (-in∂x) ψ(x, t) = -n\n,\nx\nx\n∂x\nwe obtain\n∂ψ(r, t)\nn\nin\n= -\n∆ψ(r, t) + V (r, t)ψ(r, t)\n∂t\n2m\n(where ∆ is the Laplacian operator in 3D).\n5.6 Feynman's path-integral\nThe formal solution of the Schr odinger equation above can be written as |ψ(t)) = U(t, 0) |ψ(0)). Using the position\nrepresentation and the closure relation\nR\nd3r |r) hr| = 1 we can write\n′\n′\nψ(r, t) =\nd3 r hr| U(t, 0) |r ′ ) ψ(r , 0),\n-iHt/:\nwhere U(t, 0) = e\nand the matrix element hr| U(t, 0) |r ′ ) is the Green function describing how a localized wave\n′\npacket centered at r at time t = 0 propagates at a later time in the potential V (r). This equation represents the\n′\nwave function of a single particle ψ(r, t) as a sum of partial waves propagating from r at time 0 to r at time t; it is\nthus the superposition of many different paths taken by the particle during its evolution. The probability of finding\nthe particle at r results from a multiple-path interference process.\nThis picture of the wavefunction propagation can be used to give a qualitative introduction of Feynman's path-\nintegral approach to quantum physics. We do not aim here for a rigorous derivation of that theory, only the main\nconcepts will be presented13 .\nWe start by expressing the probability amplitude that a particle, initially prepared at point xi, will pass a time\nt later at point xf as the matrix element between the initial and the final state of the system's evolution opera\ntor: hxf | U(t, 0) |xi). We expand this expression by slicing the time interval t into infinitesimal intervals δt and by\nintroducing at each of these times a closure relationship on the position eigenstates:\nhxf | U(t, 0) |xi) = hxf | U(δt)n |xi) =\ndxn..dxk ..dx1 hxf | U(t, t -δt) |xn) hxn| . . . U(δt) |xk ) hxk| . . . U(δt) |x1) hx1| U(δt, 0) |xi)\n=\ndxn..dx1 hxk| U(δt) |xk-1) . . .\n13 In this section we again closely follow the presentation in S. Haroche, J.-M. Raimond, Exploring the quantum: atoms,\ncavities and photons, Oxford University Press (2006)\n\nFig. 8: Spacetime diagram of the propagation of a particle between two events. Taken from \"Exploring the quantum\", S.\nHaroche, J-M. Raimond.,\nWe then evaluate the amplitude xk U(δt) xk\n1 in the case U(t) = e-it(p /2m+V )/:. As δt is small, we can approx\n-\nimate it by the product of the tw\nh\no t\n|\nerms:\n|\n)\n\nU(t) = e-iδt(p /2m+V )/: ≈ e-iδtV/:e-\n\niδtp2/2m: = e-\n-\n\ne\nδtp2\niδtV/:\ni\n/2m: (R\n|p) hp dp\n(where we introduced the closure\nexpression for the momentum p). We thus obtain the integral\n|\n\n)\nhxk | U(δt) |xk\n1) ≈e -\n\ni/:V (xk)δt\n\ndp ei/:p(xk-xk-1)e -i/:(p /2m)δt,\n-\nwhere we used the fact hxk|p) ∝ ei/:pxk. The integral over p is just the Fourier transform of a Gaussian, yielding a\nGaussian function of xk -xk\n1. The probability amplitude is then\n-\nh\n|\n\n|\n) ∝\n\ni/ δt[ 1 m(x -x )2\n\nxf U(t, 0) xi\ndx1dx2 . . . dx e\n:\nf\nn\n/δt -V (xn)]\nn\n. . .\n\n=\ndx dx . . . dx ei/:δt[mvn/2-V (xn)] . . . ei/:δt[mvi /2-V (xi)]\nn\nwhere we introduced the velocity vk = (xk -xk\n1)/δt. The probability amplitude for the system to go from x t\n-\ni o\nxf in time t is thus a sum of amplitudes one for each possible classical path - whose phase is the system's action\n\nS =\nR\nLdt along the trajectory, where L = 1 mv2 -V (x) = mv2 -H is the Lagrangian of the system. This phase is\nexpressed in units of n.\nWe have derived this important result by admitting the Schr odinger equation formalism of quantum mechanics.\nFeynman proceeded the other way around, postulating that a quantum system follows all the classical trajectories\nwith amplitudes having a phase given by the classical action and has derived from there Schr odinger 's equation.\nAt the classical limit S/n ≫ 1, the phase along a trajectory evolves very fast when the path is slightly modified,\nby changing for instance one of the xj . The amplitudes of various neighboring paths thus interfere destructively,\nleaving only the contributions of the trajectories for which the phase, hence the action, is stationary. If the particles\naction in units of n is much larger than 1, the particle follows a classical ray. Suppressing the contributions to the\namplitude coming from trajectories far from the classical one does not appreciably affect this amplitude.\nS\np\nac\neti\nme\nd\nia\ng\nram of the propagation of a particle between two events.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.51 Quantum Theory of Radiation Interactions\nFall 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
