Elsevier,\n2005. View the Abstract.\n\nImportance of Research to Policy:\n\"Research that clarifies our understanding of the role of finance in\neconomic growth will have policy implications and shape future\npolicy-oriented research. Information about the impact of\nfinance on economic growth will influence the priority that policy\nmakers and advisors attach to reforming financial sector policies.\nFurthermore, convincing evidence that the financial system\ninfluences long-run economic growth will advertise the urgent\nneed for research on the political, legal, regulatory, and policy\ndeterminants of financial development.\"\n\nBUT Specific Policy Implications are not Immediate:\nHowever, it is not necessarily immediate to go from the general\nidea to policy guided by the way financial systems actually work:\nthe empirical proxies for \"financial development\" frequently do\nnot measure very accurately the concepts emerging from\ntheoretical models. We are far from definitive answers to the\nquestions of whether finance cause growth, and if it does, how?\n\nRole of Financial Systems: Five categories are helpful in organizing a review\nof the theoretical literature and tying this literature to the history of\neconomic thought on finance and growth.\n- Produce information ex ante about possible investments and allocate\ncapital\n- Monitor investments and exert corporate governance after providing\nfinance\n- Facilitate the trading, diversification, and management of risk\n- Mobilize and pool savings\n- Ease the exchange of goods and services\n\nEach of these financial functions may influence savings and investment\ndecisions and hence economic growth.\n\nIssue: Levels, Steady State Transitions: So the thesis is\nthat intermediation matters and thus changes in intermediation matter.\nBut this begs the issue of whether growth happens as levels of\nintermediation systems change gradually or a good, fixed level today\ncan influence rates of growth in the future.\n\nSome theoretical caveats:\n1. Growth accounting literature, is long run growth more about technology improvement - he\nsays yes, but this leaves out transitions, which could be important, or even poverty traps,\nsystems get stuck.\n2. Savings rates are not monotone with increases in return, or improved risk bearing, it can go\nthe other way.\n\n3. Levine (2011): Finance promotes economic growth primarily by improving the efficiency of\ncapital allocation, not by increasing investment. Thus, finance should not be viewed as a\nplumbing system, where pouring more credit in one end yields more growth at the other.\nRather, finance is like an economy's central nervous system, choosing where to allocate\nresources and it's the latter thing that matters.\n\nSo does finance cause growth, reduced inequality, lower ? Not necessarily:\n\n\"Theory provides conflicting predictions concerning the relationship between financial\ndevelopment and both income distribution and poverty alleviation. Some theories claim that\nfinancial intermediary development will have a disproportionately beneficial impact on the\npoor. Banerjee and Newman (1993), Galor and Zeira (1993) and Aghion and Bolton (1997).\nOther models posit a non-linear relationship between finance and income distribution.\nGreenwood and Jovanovic (1990) show how the interaction of financial and economic\ndevelopment can give rise to an inverted U-shaped curve of income inequality and financial\nintermediary development.\"\nUnfortunately, despite his appeal to theory, the econometrics does not make the link (yet).\n\nVolatility and Growth\n\nSome facts about volatility - these are important before we start thinking that all volatility\nis coming from the financial system. More specifically, there may be links to the financial\nsystem and hence implications for policy, but we need to get specific in order to know\nhow to think productively about finance, volatility, and policy.\n\nKoren and Tenreyro . \"Volatility and Development.\" The Quarterly Journal of Economics\n(2007) 122 (1): 243-287.

Because policy comes from looking at the underpinnings, in this case sectors:\nhelps to point out the potential areas to which risk management efforts should be directed. If,\nfor example, a large part of a country's volatility is accounted for by high exposure to a few\nhigh-risk sectors, then policies aimed at mitigating volatility (or its consequences) should\nprobably focus on the development and strengthening of financial institutions and, perhaps,\non the diversification of the economy. If, instead, most of the volatility is due to country-\nspecific shocks, then attention should probably be directed to macroeconomic policy (i.e.,\nexcessive volatility might reflect inadequate aggregate domestic policies).\nQuantification: 60% is country specific, 40% is sectoral, so the latter is nontrivial. Data informs\ntheory: if diversification is limited, then one might think the correct thing to do is to\nconcentrate on developing safe sectors first. However, there is no tradeoff in the data between\nmean returns and risky returns so this might not be the correct way of thinking.\nExpress innovations in the growth rate of GDP per worker in country j, denoted by qj, as the\nweighted sum of the innovations in the growth rates of value-added per worker in every\nsector, yjs, with s = 1, ..., S:\nqj = ∑s ajsyjs,\n\nwhere the weights ajs denote the share of employment in sector s of country j.\n\nTo separate the role of domestic aggregate risk from that of the sectoral composition of the\neconomy, we can further breakdown innovations to a sector's growth rate, yjs, into three\ndisturbances:\nyjs = λs + μj + εjs.\n\nAcemoglu and Zilibotti (1997) \"Was Prometheus\nUnbound by Chance? Risk, Diversification, and\nGrowth.\"\nA model which explains why poor countries are\nand remain volatile even as they grow. It's very\ncostly to have sectors/projects/assets which\ncover all shocks and the optimal investment\nstrategy leaves holes for a while. There is an\noptimal financial policy which involves\nbuilding pooling resources and limits re-trade\nbut does not escape the proposition that\ndiversification is costly.\n\nKey fact: Growth may come at the expense of financial volatility/crises,\ni.e., without credit busts, countries do not grow.\n\nThis statement is not causal, but if we take correlation of finance and\ngrowth seriously, then we should take this seriously too.\n\nView the abstract.\n\nSome more details on the measures used: crises\nare the principal source of negative skewness\nonce we have controlled for major exogenous\nshocks such as wars and large scale deterioration\nin the terms of trade. \"We choose not to use\nvariance to capture the uneven progress\nassociated with financial fragility because high\nvariance captures not only rare, large, and abrupt\ncontractions, but also frequent or symmetric\nshocks.\"\n\n\"Thailand and India illustrate the choices available to countries with weak institutions. Whereas\nIndia followed a path of slow but steady growth, Thailand experienced high growth, lending\nbooms, and crisis (see Figure I). GDP per capita grew by only 114% between 1980 and 2002 in\nIndia, whereas Thailand's GDP per capita grew by 162%, despite the effects of a major crisis.\"\nContent removed due to copyright restrictions. View Figure 1 from Ranciere et. al. (2008).\nhttp://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/123/1/359.full.pdf+html\n\nHow their model works: it's political economy, misregulation:\n\"Here, we present a stochastic growth model where growth depends\non the nature of the financial system. We consider an economy\nwhere imperfect contract enforceability generates borrowing\nconstraints, as agents cannot commit to repay debt. This financial\nbottleneck leads to low growth because investment is constrained by\nfirms' internal funds...\"\n\nPolicy conclusion is nuanced:\n\"Crises are costly. Widespread bankruptcies entail severe deadweight\nlosses. Furthermore, the resultant collapse in internal funds\ndepresses new credit and investment, hampering growth. But is it\npossible for systemic risk taking to increase long-run growth by\ncompensating for the effects of enforceability problems? Yes...\"\n\nFinance and Volatility\n\nBoth Acemoglu et al. and Ranciere et al. suggest that\nvolatility can (should) diminish at higher levels of output.\n\nHowever, to the extent that growth and volatility are\ncorrelated, the bilateral pairings of topics are not all\nconsistent with one another, i.e. finance causes growth,\ngrowth comes with volatility, but finance reduced volatility.\n\nThere is related empirical work trying to sort this out:\nDabla-Norris and Srivisal (2013), \"Revisiting the Link\nBetween Finance and Macroeconomic Volatility\"\n\nRead the summary of the article.\n\nThese policy conclusions seem to leave the context of the above review of the literature,\nforgetting lessons learned: empirical patterns in the aggregate data, need to\nsectoral/micro data, needs to integrate data analysis is theory. Some examples\n\nLevine (2011) \"Regulating Finance and Regulators to Promote Growth\"\nContrast with his earlier paper and with the literature that argues that some volatility is\ninevitable:\n\nMotivation is financial crisis: \"Following the global financial crisis of 2008, countries\nstabilized their financial systems and attempted to bolster regulatory systems to protect\nagainst systemic risks. Disappointing rates of recovery, however, have shifted the policy\nfocus to growth. How important is the operation of the financial system for economic\ngrowth and which financial regulatory reforms will improve financial sector operations\nand promote growth?\"\n\nRead the abstract and the article.\n\nThe idea is that by looking at the data, and controlling for various factors, we can draw\npolicy conclusions.\n\n(c) International Monetary Fund.

Being on the frontier means Pareto optimal (it does take\ndata, but also conceptual frameworks, to determine this). Beck's financial\npossibility frontier is in contrast almost exclusively empirical.\n\nHe distinguishes structural, from institutional, from policy:\nStructural problems holding back frontier\nInstitutional deficiencies holding back frontier - country-specific analysis of\nbinding constraints\nPolicy restrictions keeping country below frontier\nCross-country comparison that can identify policies that can explain country's\nposition relative to frontier\n\nSomehow the empirical frontier is used as a metric warning: Being beyond frontier\nmight indicate overshooting. Benchmarking analysis can serve as additional crisis\nindicator.\nAn important comment on policy and implementation problems in the end: all\nfinancial sector reform is local! Ignore political economy at your own risk.\n\nAnother policy paper that concentrates on credit booms and is motivated by the recent financial\ncrisis.\nRead the Executive Summary.\n\nThere is the view that financial liberalization is a cause: first, credit booms are often triggered by\nfinancial reform, capital inflow surges associated with capital account liberalizations, and\nperiods of strong economic growth insistence on understanding trade off and prescribing\npolicy but its largely a policy of preventing booms. This note explores past credit booms with\nthe objective of assessing the effectiveness of macroeconomic and macro prudential policies in\nreducing the risk of a crisis or, at least, limiting its consequences. For instance, Basel III\nintroduced a capital buffer range that is adjusted \"when there are signs that credit has grown\nto excessive levels\" (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2010).\n\nSee individual sections on monetary policy, fiscal policy, macro prudential: it's a literature review\nbut policies are not tied that tightly to models and not getting beneath the surface of\naggregated evidence.\n\n1.\nUnderstanding the unit of analysis and the data\n\n2.\nApplied General Equilibrium Development\nEconomics\n\n3.\nWhat it is, and what it is not\n\nIndia\n\nTownsend (1994) \"Risk and Insurance in Village India\"\n\nUsing general equilibrium structure, derive efficiency, benchmark\nstandards for outcomes\n*\nIdiosyncratic shocks are pooled, aggregate must be shared\n*\nHere, look at \"starting point\" and outcomes\n\nincome vs. consumption\n*\nMore generally though, literature now includes other outcomes\n\nlabor supply (intensive, extensive) margins\n\ninvestment (cash flow)\n\nlevels of capital (human and physical), occupation choice\nConsumption\nIncome\n(c) The Econometric Society.

      "content": "14.772\nLecture 2\nFebruary 7, 2013\nRobert M. Townsend\n\nMicro Founded Macro Models\nTheoretical models tell well articulated, plausible stories of the impact of the financial\nsector on growth, inequality, poverty. But how do we know that these models match up\nto reality and can thus help us in the formulation of policy?\nThis lecture shows how to estimate the key financial economic underpinnings of two\nwell known, pre-existing models in the literature. The case study is Thailand but we\nextend this local within-country data and to data from other countries.\nWe do this by fitting micro economic data to the choices that households and\nbusinesses make, thus delivering a subset of the key parameters. The remaining\nparameters are calibrated at plausible values, but typically using only subsets of the\ndata, as with initial conditions. Then the model at all these imposed parameter values is\nsimulated over time, and predicted paths of macro aggregates are compared to actual\ntime paths in the data. Macro aggregates include growth, inequality, income, savings\nrates, and labor share of GDP, as well as key parts of each model, that is, the fraction of\nhouseholds running business or the fraction of households participating in the financial\nsector. Financial deepening is exogenous, imposed at observed values in one model,\nand endogenous, a key choice in the other.\n\nMicro Founded Macro Models (cont.)\n\nEach model lends itself to a quantification of the welfare gains from a policy intervention. In the model\nwith an exogenous expansion of the financial sector, we can measure impact on winners as well as\nlosers, as households may or may not shift occupations as access to credit and savings increases, and\neven when they do not shift, there are changes in investment on the intensive margin. The impact of\nfinancial deepening depends as well on endogenous wages and interest rates; eventually increasing\nwages have a huge impact on the relatively poor who do not start businesses but work for others. In the\nmodel with endogenous financial deepening, a government takeover of the banking system creates an\ninefficiency wedge which is associated with a clearly evident stagnation in growth rates. The welfare loses\nfrom this repression, and conversely the welfare gains from subsequent financial liberalization are\nquantified using the lens of the model.\n\nThough welfare gains as a fraction of wealth from financial liberalization can be quite large, the impact on\nsubsequent growth can be small, if not negligible, as growth depends on the endogenous expansion of\nthe financial system, which depends on investment in costly infrastructure. Likewise, time series and\npanel data generated from the model offer a stark warning that running cross-country regressions to\nassess the impact of finance on growth and inequality is treacherous if the data come from actual\neconomies in transitions (not yet in steady state).\n\nThe larger theme here, however, is not to promote these two models as the end of the story, but rather\nto promote the method of analytic attack. The models are relatively successful in Thailand, but fit less\nwell in Mexico, especially during a devaluation and sudden stop. As it turns out, that outcome was\npredictable from the first step, from the ability the assumed key ingredients to fit the micro data. Indeed,\none can take each of the models to local, village and regional data within Thailand, and deduce that the\noccupation choice model is reasonably successful, but the financial depending model does not take into\nthe account the contrasting behavior of government vs. private sector financial service providers. The\nlecture ends with a comparison of the successes and failures of each model, hence directions for further\nresearch. Ultimately policy recommendations vary from one model to the next so it is important to find\none that is approximately correct in both its micro and macro aspects.\n\n\"Growth and Inequality: Model Evaluation Based on an Estimation-\nCalibration Strategy\" Jeong & Townsend, 2003\n...\"\n\nEmpirical Observations on M exico and Thailand\nCalibration\nDSGE with Financial Sector\nNew mo dels\nStatic Applied General Equilibrium: Dual Sector Model\nBernhardt and Lloyed-Ellis ( Restud 2000) and Gine and Townsend\n(2004)\nOccupational choice: Farmers, Workers and Entrepreneurs\nGiven distribution of talent, i.e. Oxed-cost of openning a Orm H (x)\nover (0, 1), distribution of inherited wealth G (b)\nFarmers: W = g + b\nWorkers: W = w v + b\nEntrepeneurs:\nW = max0l and 0k bx ff (k, l) wl (k + x)g + b\nA person with inherited wealth b and talent x chooses her profession\nto maximize W : w > w = v + g then no one will be farmer.

A reasonably-calibrated\nneoclassical model a capital share of 1/3, a discount factor of 0.96, an\nintertemporal elasticity of substitution of 0.67, and a depreciation rate of 0.06\npredicts that it should take fewer than six years for aggregate capital stock to\ncover half the distance to the steady state.

The economic transition is gradual. Following the reform, GDP grows at\nan annualized rate of 3.6% for 18 years, and it takes 10.5 years for the\ncapital stock to cover half the distance to the new, post-reform steady\nstate almost twice as long as the comparably calibrated neoclassical\ntransition.\n2. The model generates endogenous dynamics of TFP, which increases by 5%\nper year for eight years, although there is no further exogenous change\nafter the reform.\n3. The investment rate rises over time, peaking six years after the reform.\n4. We show that, in the data from the reform episodes, there is substantial\nand persistent reallocation of production factors, across different industrial\nsectors and also from state-owned production units to those in the private\nsector.\n\nBuera and Shin (2012), \"Financial Frictions and the Persistence of History:\nA Quantitative Exploration\", main exercise part II\n5. For the three countries with available data Japan, Korea, and Singapore\nthe average manufacturing plant size increased after the reforms. On\naverage, plant size increased by 80% over the 15 years following the\nreform, in line with the model prediction.\n6. A similar pattern emerges in Thailand, for which we have data on\nemployment by firm size bins. While the data are available only from\n1988, five years after the identified reform, they show a substantial\nincrease in the fraction of workers employed in firms with more than 100\nemployees (from 21% in 1988 to 41% in 1998), and also a corresponding\ndecline in the fraction of workers employed in firms with fewer than ten\nemployees (from 58% to 39%).\n7. These patterns in the data are broadly consistent with the post-reform\ndynamics of the average establishment size in the model.\n\nModel:\n▶Transition dynamics are endogenously determined by the extent of\nresource misallocation in the pre-reform economy and the degree of\nimperfections in financial markets.\n▶Individuals differ in their entrepreneurial productivity and choose each\nperiod whether to be an entrepreneur and operate his technology or to\nsupply labor for wage.\n▶Financial frictions in the form of collateral constraints are modeled by\nassuming imperfect enforceability of contracts.\nWe calibrate the parameters that are invariant across countries and over time\nso that our undistorted, perfect-credit model economy matches the US data on\nstandard macroeconomic aggregates, earnings distribution, establishment size\ndistribution, and establishment dynamics. As for the reform-related parameters,\nthe degree of an economys financial frictions is calibrated to the data on\nexternal finance to GDP ratios, and the distribution of pre-reform idiosyncratic\ndistortions is chosen to match the changes in TFP and capital-to-output ratios\nbetween the year of the reform and the twentieth post-reform year.\nWe then use our model to quantify the role of initial resource misallocation and\nfinancial frictions in explaining the actual time paths of GDP, TFP, and\ninvestment rates along the growth accelerations or economic miracles in the\ndata.\n\nBuera and Shin (2012), \"Financial Frictions and the Persistence of History:\nA Quantitative Exploration\"\nPre-reform economy:\n▶Resources are misallocated.\n▶Subsidized entrepreneurs run larger operations and have more income and\nwealth than is warranted by their true productivity, while the opposite is\ntrue for taxed entrepreneurs.\n▶Productive entrepreneurs returns to saving are high since wealth, via\ncollateral constraints, enables entry and expansion of business and so are\ntheir saving rates.\n▶Those with low entrepreneurial productivity are either workers or\nunconstrained, small-scale entrepreneurs, and hence their returns to\nsaving, and accordingly their saving rates, are much lower.\n▶The aggregate saving rate is an income-weighted average of the two\ngroups saving rates, and as a consequence starts out low.\n\nBuera and Shin (2012), \"Financial Frictions and the Persistence of History:\nA Quantitative Exploration\"\nThe sudden reform initiates a process of massive resource reallocation:\n▶The underdeveloped financial market acts as a bottleneck: It takes time\nfor productive-but-poor entrepreneurs to save up the collateral needed for\nstarting a business and then operating at the efficient scale.\n▶This gradual reallocation the entry and expansion of productive-but-poor\nentrepreneurs and the downsizing and exit of incompetent,\npreviously-subsidized ones manifests itself in the slow pace of the\ntransition overall, and more important, in the persistent TFP dynamics.\n▶Over time, productive entrepreneurs, with their high saving rates, account\nfor larger fractions of wealth and income, and the aggregate saving rate\nrises.\n▶Eventually, the diminishing marginal returns to capital take over, and even\nthe saving rates of productive entrepreneurs, who are less likely to be\nconstrained now, start to fall over time, spanning the downward arc of the\naggregate saving rate.\n\nBuera and Shin (2012), \"Financial Frictions and the Persistence of History:\nA Quantitative Exploration\"\nExercise: incorporate an exogenous financial development process, which is\ncalibrated to the observed increase in measures of financial intermediation\nalong the growth experiences.\nIn year 0, we maintain the assumption that all idiosyncratic distortions are\nremoved at once. In addition, assume now an increase in the external finance\nto GDP ratio from 0.3 to 0.86 over the next 20 years, which also takes 20 years\nin the data. We assume that individuals in the model have perfect foresight\nabout this exogenous process.\nThe results are qualitatively similar to the benchmark results. This exercise has\nmore financial frictions than the benchmark exercise exactly when the economy\nhas the most misallocation (i.e., right after the reform). Not surprisingly,\nespecially immediately following the reform, the reallocation and the transitions\nare slower here: It takes 13 years (rather than 10.5) for the aggregate capital to\ncover half the distance to the new steady state. The investment rate also rises\nmore gradually than in the benchmark exercise, as the more severe financial\nfrictions in early stages slow down the growth of productive-but-poor\nentrepreneurs.\n\nJeong and Townsend (2007), \"Sources of TFP Growth: Occupational\nChoice and Financial Deepening\"\nExogenous expansion of financial sector on the extensive margin explains\nmacro, time-varying TFP.\nThis paper explains and measures the sources of TFP by developing a method\nof growth accounting based on an integrated use of transitional growth models\nand micro data. We decompose TFP growth into the occupational-shift effect,\nfinancial-deepening effect, capital-heterogeneity effect, and\nsectoral-Solow-residuals. Applying this method to Thailand, which experienced\nrapid growth with enormous structural changes between 1976 and 1996, we\nfind that 73% of TFP growth is explained by occupational shifts and financial\ndeepening, without presuming exogenous technical progress. Expansion of\ncredit is a major part. We also show the role of endogenous interaction\nbetween factor price dynamics and the wealth distribution for TFP.\n\nJeong and Townsend (2007), \"Sources of TFP Growth: Occupational\nChoice and Financial Deepening\"\n-0.05\n0.05\n0.1\n2.1.

A large and persistent increase in the private saving rate in emerging Asia\nagainst a steady decline in the private saving rate in advanced economies.\n2. The emergence of global imbalances with developing countries running a\nlarge current account surplus and advanced economies a current account\ndeficit.\n3. A sustained fall in the world long-term interest rate.\nRecent theoretical advances have been designed to explain (2) and (3), with\nlittle emphasis placed on (1) despite its underlying centrality.\nThe pattern is even more obvious when it comes to household saving rates in\ncountries such as the U.S. and China. In 1988, household saving rates were\nabout the same in the two countries at about 5%. By 2007 the household\nsaving rate in China reached almost 30% while that of the U.S. declined to a\nlevel of about 2.5%. This begs the question as to why saving behaviors against\ncommon world interest rate movements can be diametrically opposite across\neconomies.\n\nCoeurdacier, Guibaud and Jin (2012), \"Credit Constraints and Growth in a\nGlobal Economy\"\nA full calibration of our model to the experience of these two economies\nindicates that our mechanism can explain about 40% of the divergence in\naggregate saving rates of these two economies and a significant fraction of the\nchanges in saving rate at cohort level in each economy.\nThe main supportive evidence is that the decline in the young's saving rate is\nlarger in the U.S. than in China, and the rise in the saving rate by the\nmiddle-aged in China is larger than the rise in the U.S.\nThe key departure of this paper from the existing literature is the ability of our\nframework to explain the divergence in saving rates that is, the differential\nresponse of saving rates to interest rate changes that leads to their greater\ndispersion in the long run. Existing models with a saving-based account of\nglobal imbalances tend to focus on differences in the levels of saving rates, and\nthe outflow of capital from the high-saving rate country to the low-saving rate\ncountry upon integration of these economies. Over time, however, differences\nin levels do not become more pronounced whereas in the data, initial\ndifferences in saving rates in 1990 are dwarfed by their differences in 2010.\nMoreover, when incorporating the growth experiences of countries, existing\npapers tend to predict the opposite patterns.\n\nCoeurdacier, Guibaud and Jin (2012), \"Credit Constraints and Growth in a\nGlobal Economy\"\nOur benchmark framework consists of multiple open economies, populated with\noverlapping generations of agents living for three periods. In all economies,\nyoung agents are subject to borrowing constraints, but the tightness of the\nconstraint is more severe in developing countries than in advanced economies.\nWe show that a countrys aggregate saving places a greater weight on the\n(dis)saving of the young for less credit-constrained economies, and greater\nweight on the middle-ageds saving for more constrained economies. A fall in\nthe world interest rate induces greater borrowing (lower savings) by the young\nthrough a loosening of constraints while leading to greater savings of the\nmiddle-aged through a dominant income effect.\nIn this framework the decline in the world interest rate is brought about by the\nincreasing size of Asia relative to the rest of the world.\n\nCoeurdacier, Guibaud and Jin (2012), \"Credit Constraints and Growth in a\nGlobal Economy\"\nComparisons with other literature:\nOur model is an extension and variation of Jappelli and Pagano's (1994)\nclosed-economy three-period OLG model with household credit constraints.\nThe surge in investment due to the strong neoclassical effect can potentially\ndominate the effect driven by high precautionary saving in emerging markets.\nBuera and Shin (2009), Benhima (2012), and Song, Storesletten and Zilibotti\n(2011) the point of contention with this literature from an empirical viewpoint\nmay be that even though investment as a share of GDP declined during the\nEast Asian crisis, it quickly reverted to and subsequently exceeded its pre-crisis\nlevel. The recent period during which global imbalances were most pronounced\nsaw an increase in investment-GDP in Asia rather than a fall.\nAnother strand of the literature holds that corporate saving behavior is pivotal\nin accounting for global imbalances. However, levels of corporate savings have\nrisen uniformly in both developing and advanced economies, with China\nactually experiencing a fall in its corporate saving rate making corporate\nsaving behavior less likely to be the main factor of divergence.\n\nTable of Contents\nFeaturing especially transitions rather than steady state\ngrowth.

However, this is\nstill only 29% of the gap between its potential and actual output).\nIn the model, improvements in financial intermediation account for 29% of U.S.\ngrowth.\nThe framework also is capable of mimicking the striking decline in the\nTaiwanese interest-rate spread. At the same time, it predicts a significant rise\nin its capital-to-output ratio. It is estimated that dramatic improvements in\nTaiwans financial sector accounted for 45% of the country's economic growth.\n\nGreenwood, Sanchez, and Wang (2013),\"Quantifying the Impact of\nFinancial Development on Economic Development\"\nFig. 1.

The source of inspiration for the framework is the classic work by\nTownsend (1979) and Williamson (1986).\nNovel twists:\n1. Firms monitor cash flows; however, here the efficiency of this activity\ndepends on both the amount of resources devoted to it and the\nproductivity of the monitoring technology used in the financial sector.\n2. Firms have ex-ante differences in the structure of returns that they offer.\n\nGreenwood, Sanchez, and Wang (2013),\"Quantifying the Impact of\nFinancial Development on Economic Development\"\nA financial theory of firm size emerges:\n▶At any point in time, firms offering high expected returns are underfunded\n(relative to a world without informational frictions), whereas others\nyielding low expected returns are overfunded. This results from\ndiminishing returns in information production.\n▶As the efficiency of the financial sector rises (relative to the rest of the\neconomy), funds are redirected away from less productive firms in the\neconomy toward more productive ones.\n▶As the interest-rate spread declines and the cost of borrowing falls, capital\ndeepening occurs in the economy.\n\nGreenwood, Sanchez, and Wang (2013),\"Quantifying the Impact of\nFinancial Development on Economic Development\"\nFig. 2.

The idiosyncratic level of\nproductivity is a random variable. The realized value of θ is drawn from\nthe two-point set τ = {θ1, θ2}, with θ1 < θ2. The set τ is the firms type\nand differs across firms.\nFinancial intermediaries:\n▶Intermediation is competitive.\n▶Intermediaries raise funds from consumers and lend them to firms.\n▶Even though an intermediary knows a firms type, τ, it cannot observe the\nstate of a firms business (θ , o, and l) either costlessly or perfectly.\n\nGreenwood, Sanchez, and Wang (2013),\"Quantifying the Impact of\nFinancial Development on Economic Development\"\nLet Pij(lmj, k, z) denote the probability that the firm is caught cheating\nconditional on the following:\n1. The true realization of productivity is θi\n2. The firm makes a report of θj\n3. The intermediary allocates lmj units of labor to monitor the claim\n4. The size of the loan is k (which represents the scale of the project)\n5. The level of productivity in the monitoring activity is z\nThe function Pij(lmj, k, z) is increasing in lmj and z and decreasing in k.\nThe steady state for the model provides a mapping between productivity in the\nproduction (x) and financial sectors (z) on the one hand, and output (o) and\ninterest-rate spreads (s) on the other. This mapping can be inverted to infer x\nand z using observations on o and s, given a vector of parameter values, p.\nTake the parameter vector p that was calibrated/estimated for the U.S.\neconomy and use the Taiwanese data on per-capita GDPs and interest-rate\nspreads for the years 1974 and 2004 to obtain the imputed Taiwanese\ntechnology vector.\n\nMartin and Taddei (2012), \"International Capital Flows and Credit Market\nImperfections: a Tale of Two Frictions\"\nExcessive capital flows and boom-bust cycles (at least in theory, not\nquantitative/calibrated).\nIn recent years, global imbalances large and persistent capital flows from Asia\nto the United States and other developed economies have spurred renewed\ninterest in the macroeconomic effects of financial frictions. Financial frictions\nhave also been invoked to explain the run-up to the financial crisis of 2007-08\nand the unfolding of events during the crisis itself.\n\nMartin and Taddei (2012), \"International Capital Flows and Credit Market\nImperfections: a Tale of Two Frictions\"\nInstead of limiting the amount of resources that can be channeled towards\nproductive investment, financial frictions are portrayed in the literature as the\nsource of an excessive supply of assets that has channeled too many resources\ntowards unproductive investment. (We covered such papers earlier, as on\nChina.)\nWe need to acknowledge that there are different types of frictions. On the one\nhand, underprovision of assets and limited investment are typically attributed to\nlimited pledgeability. On the other hand, overprovision of assets is typically\nattributed to some form of asymmetric information regarding the quality of\nborrowers, which fuels investment by unproductive or inefficient individuals.\nExisting macroeconomic models focus mostly on limited pledgeability while\nneglecting adverse selection (see previous lecture).\n\nMartin and Taddei (2012), \"International Capital Flows and Credit Market\nImperfections: a Tale of Two Frictions\"\nWe have a standard growth model in which credit markets intermediate\nresources between savers and investors in capital accumulation. Individuals are\nendowed with some resources and an investment project for producing capital,\nand they must decide whether: (i) to undertake their project and become\nentrepreneurs, in which case they demand funds from credit markets, or; (ii) to\nforego their project and become savers, in which case they supply their\nresources to credit markets.\nTo give adverse selection a central role in credit markets, we also assume that\nan individual's productivity is private information and thus unobservable by\nlenders. This induces cross-subsidization between high- and low-productivity\nentrepreneurs.\nAll borrowers must pay the same contractual interest rate in equilibrium. This\nimplies that high-productivity entrepreneurs, who repay often, effectively face a\nhigher cost of funds than low-productivity entrepreneurs, who repay only\nseldom. It is this feature that gives rise to adverse selection by providing some\nlow-productivity individuals, who would be savers in the absence of\ncross-subsidization, with incentives to become entrepreneurs.\n\nMartin and Taddei (2012), \"International Capital Flows and Credit Market\nImperfections: a Tale of Two Frictions\"\nMacroeconomic implications of adverse selection:\n1. It leads to an increase in the economy's equilibrium interest rate, while\nboosting equilibrium borrowing and investment.\n2. By fostering inefficient entrepreneurship, it generates a negative wedge\nbetween the marginal return to investment and the equilibrium interest\nrate.\nThrough (1), adverse selection induces the economy to attract more capital\nflows and boosts net capital inflows from the international financial market,\nrelative to the full-information economy. By (2), since the true marginal return\nto investment lies below the world interest rate, these capital inflows can lead\nto a fall in aggregate consumption.\n\nMoll, Townsend, and Zhorin (2012), \"Entrepreneurship, Inequality, and\nGrowth with Information Constrained Factor Markets\"\nThere is evidence that even within a given economy, obstacles to trade may\nvary depending on location. In a companion paper, Karaivanov and Townsend\n(2012) estimate the financial/information regime in place for households\nincluding those running businesses using Townsend Thai data from rural areas\n(villages) and from urban areas (towns and cities). They find differences across\nthese locations. For example, a moral hazard constrained financial regime fits\nbest in urban areas and a more limited savings regime in rural areas. More\ngenerally, there seems to be (related) regional variation.\nA number of recent papers argue that financial frictions arising from limited\ncommitment problems can explain large cross-country income differences. We\nargue that different micro financial underpinnings have potentially very\ndifferent implications at both the macro and the micro level. To this end, we\ndevelop a general equilibrium framework that encompasses different regimes of\nfrictions, and compare the implications of two concrete frictions: limited\ncommitment and moral hazard.\n\nMoll, Townsend, and Zhorin (2012), \"Entrepreneurship, Inequality, and\nGrowth with Information Constrained Factor Markets\"\n1. Aggregate TFP in the two regimes is depressed but for completely\ndifferent reasons:\n▶Under limited commitment this results from a misallocation of capital\nacross firms with given productivities.\n▶Under moral hazard, TFP is endogenously lower at the firm level because\nentrepreneurs exert suboptimal effort.\n2. Occupational choice, the firm productivity and size distributions, and\nincome and wealth inequality also differ markedly.\n3. Individual transitions are much faster in the limited commitment regime\nthan under the moral hazard, resulting for example in more dispersed\nwealth growth rates:\n▶In the limited commitment regime binding borrowing constraints and high\nmarginal products of capital provide an incentive for entrepreneurs to\nattempt to save themselves out of these constraints.\n▶Under moral hazard individual wealth or promised utility moves slowly as\noutput-dependent penalties and awards are spread into the future.\n4. There are implications as well for regional and sectoral capital flows.\n\nMoll, Townsend, and Zhorin (2012), \"Entrepreneurship, Inequality, and\nGrowth with Information Constrained Factor Markets\"\nIn particular, the most realistic financial regime for the given economy, which\nvaries regionally and in urban vs. rural stratifications of the data, is a not a\nsimple convex combination of the two extremes. The bottom line is that the\nbehavior of macro aggregates depends on micro financial underpinnings.\n\nMotivation\nModel\nLimited Commitment vs. Private Information\nMixtures\nTransitions\nFinance and Development:\nLimited Commitment vs. Moral Hazard\nBenjamin Moll\nRobert M.

      "content": "Measurement in development\n- Measurement in development is extremely important, albeit sometimes neglected\ntopic. this is summarized by two quotes, one old and one new:\n- Lord Kelvin: In physical science a first essential step in the direction of learning any\nsubject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for\nmeasuring some quality connected with it. I often say that when you can measure\nwhat you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something\nabout it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers,\nyour knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of\nknowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of\nscience, whatever the matter may be.\n\nBill Gates' quote removed due to copyright restrictions.\nTo read his comments, visit the article on the Wall Street Journal.\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323539804578261780648285770.html.\n\nFortunately economists have development a common coherent set of\nmeasurement tools which achieve this objective. Further they do not require a\ndistinction between microeconomics and macro economics but rather, can\nbe applied at the household, village, regional, national, and international level . In a\nsense one size fits all so a little investment in learning these tools goes a long way.\nThey are useful for a variety of sub disciplines and, further, allow integration across\nsub fields.\n\nThe basis unit is the set of financial accounts: the balance sheet, income stmt, and stmt\nof cash flow. These are typically thought of as relevant as they are applied to corporate\nfirms but they are highly useful as applied to households, especially those running business\nand enterprise, as is typical in developing countries. Below in this lecture we outline the\nsteps for doing this.\nAs a result we can make the distinction between the income statement (on an accrual\nbasis of accounting) and the stmt of cash flow allow , which in turn allows us to separate\nout long run productivity, return on assets/projects versus short run liquidity problems. We\ncan thus measure how a given entrepreneur or household manages is wealth, its portfolio\nof assets and liabilities, and how it manages if it can to smooth short term financial deficits,\nthe difference between consumption plus investment less income.\nAs changes in the balance sheet and net worth are linked mechanically to savings as\nmeasured from the income statement plus incoming gifts and remittances, we can use the\ntool to understand where increases and decreases in net worth are coming from (in\naddition to poverty dynamics and inequity, changes in households relative standings in the\ncommunity, in the cross sectional distribution of wealth.) Growth of net worth may come\nfrom incoming gifts, but for many the larger part is due to savings rates and productivity\n(return on assets). For the most part return on assets is persistent and indeed, those with\nhigh rates of return self-invest back into their own business/ household enterprise. Others\nprefer financial assets. The point is the savings and productivity are to breakdown\nperformance into key factors, and thus one can assess the impact of changing\ncircumstances or policy interventions on these components.\n\nAggregating up to larger units, the household financial accounts allow us to create\nfor villages (or collections of villages in a region), the village (regional) income and\nproduct accounts\" : production accounts, appropriation accounts, savings/investment\naccounts. Finally we can get the village (regional) balance of payment accounts, and\nuse the tools of international economics to study trade and financial flows within a\ncountry.\nFinally, that part of savings which is financial rather than real investment, by\nconstruction is associated with changes in financial assets. We can thus create the\nflow of funds and measure financial intermediation across sectors (household,\nbusiness, government, financial firms, and foreigners), where useful by particular\nasset/instrument. We can do this at the regional and village level, as well. This is a key\ncomponent in the constructing models with financial underpinnings, so that we are\nnot in ignorance, our knowledge is not meager, and we can measure the role of the\nfinancial system in times of growth and macro instability, including regional disparities,\nand assess the need for and impact of regulatory and macro policy.\n\nHouseholds as Corporate Firms:\nAn Analysis of Household Finance Using Integrated\nHousehold Surveys and Corporate Financial Accounting\nKrislert Samphantharak, UC San Diego\nRobert M. Townsend, MIT\n\nObjectives\n- We create the balance sheet, income\nstatement, and statement of cash flows for\nhouseholds in developing countries.\n- The purpose is to better measure productivity,\nrisk, and the financial situation in an analysis\nof high frequency panel data.\n\nUnfortunately,...\n\"... The only way to obtain ... [these] measures is\nby imposing an accounting framework on the\ndatal and painstakingly construct estimates\nfrom myriad responses to questions about the\nspecific components that contribute to the\ntotal... II Angus Deatonl 1997\n\nThe Problems\n- There are often large timing differences between inputs\npurchased and outputs sold as for farmers with\ninfrequent harvests and timing differences between\ninputs acquired and revenue received as for businesses\nwith trade credit.\n- Thus high frequency data are important for the study of\nliquidity, the smoothing of consumption, the protection\nof investment from cash flow fluctuations, and the\nfinancing of budget deficits.\n- This necessitates the distinction between cash flow as a\nmeasure of liquidity and net income as a measure of\nperformance.\n\nWhat We Do\n- Apply, and modify where appropriate, the\nstandard financial accounting, as these were\ninvented to draw this distinction.\n\nHouseholds as Corporate Firms:\nFinance\n- Assets\n- Household debt as Firm's liabilities\n- WeaIth as Equity\n-\nInitial wealth as Contributed capital\n-\nSavings as Retained earnings\n- Consumption as Dividends\n- Gifts as Equity issue\n- Household budget constraint as Firm cash flow\nconstraint\n\nCorporate financial accounts help us\ndistinguish...\n- Assets vs. Wealth\n- Accrual income vs. Cash flow\n- Savings as budget surplus (as in cash flow statement)\nvs. Savings as change in wealth accumulation (as in\nbalance sheet)\n- Liquidity management (of budget deficit) vs. Asset &\nliability management (of wealth accumulation)\n\n1. Asset, liability and wealth\n- Assets\n- Liabilities\nCash in hand\nAccount payables (Trade\nAccount receivables (Trade\ncredits)\ncredits)\nOther borrowing\nDeposit at financial\n- Wealth\ninstitutions\nInitial wealth\nROSCA (Net position)\nCumulative net gift\nOther lending\nreceived\nInventories\nCumulative savings\nFixed assets\n(Retained earnings)\n- Household assets\n- Agricultural assets\n- Business assets\n- Land and other fixed\nassets\n\n2. Multi-period production, storage and\ninventory\n- LSMS agricultural module asks about inputs used over a\nspecified cropping season, and the amount spent, equating\nthe two\n- However if the household used inputs held in previous\ninventory, then expenditures during the specified season\nmight be recorded as zero\n- Likewise, inputs purchased during the season may not have\nbeen used on the plot\n- Though perhaps not overly inaccurate in annual crop cycles,\nthe problem can become more acute in monthly or quarterly\ndata\n\n2. Multi-period production, storage and\ninventory, Cont.\n- Townsend Thai monthly survey asks first for the\n(value and quantity of) inputs acquired since the\nprevious interview and then for actual (value and\nquantity of) inputs used on land plots\n- An input inventory account can thus be constructed\n(inputs acquired but not yet used)\n- Revenue raises similar timing issues\n\n3. Outputs from one production\nactivities as inputs in others\n- Example: Household may raise chickens and use their eggs\nas input for food sold in its restaurant\n- We treat this transaction as if the household sold the\noutput from one activity (in a market), and then\nrepurchases the same commodity at the same value (from\nthe market) as the input for the other activity\n- If the net income from the second activity is realized in the\nsame period, there is no change in both the total\nhousehold net income and total cash flow from\nproduction because revenue from one activity is\ncompletely offset by cost from the other activity\n- Net income of the second activity may not be realized in\nthe same period if the input is used in multi-period\nproduction process (See previous slide)\n\n5. In-Kind Transaction\n- Non-cash transactions are not included in the standard\nstatement of cash flows for a corporate firm since they do\nnot change cash holdings\n- However, we decide to include both cash and non-cash\ntransactions with outside entities in the statement of cash\nflows\n- Reasons:\n-\nBarter exchanges are common in developing economies\n-\nAssumption of liquidity as reflected by cash alone is not entirely\nappropriate for households in developing countries\n- The ability to use commodities as a medium of exchange may help the\nhouseholds mitigate the problem of a cash-only budget constraint\n\n7. Livestock\n-\nIn some cases, household revenues are from selling the outputs\nproduced by the animals (such as chicken eggs or milk) and in other\ncases the revenues are from selling the animals themselves (such as\nchickens or cows)\n-\nwe consider the animals as one type of household assets and\ndistinguish between the two different incomes generated by the\nlivestock\n(1) Livestock Activity\n-\nSale of milk = Revenue from livestock activity\n-\nSpending on animal feed and vaccine = Cost of livestock activity\n(2) Livestock Assets\n-\nSale of cows (alive or dead) = Income as capital gain (or loss, if the sale\nprice is lower than the purchase price) to the livestock assets\n-\nWe depreciate the livestock as they age\n-\nWhen an animal dies prematurely, we treat it as capital loss; when a\nnew animal is born, it is considered as capital gain within the total\nlivestock asset category\n\n8. Gift &Transfer\n-\nGifts are special transactions since they contribute to the wealth of\nthe household without being directly related to the production\nprocess so it is not the savings of the household\n-\nUnlike borrowing, the gift is not a household's liability as it is not a\nsimple debt\n-\nwe create a new line item under household wealth called\ncumulative net gifts received\n-\nIn this way the gift received is interpreted as an increase in wealth\nand it is comparable to new equity issued to new shareholders in a\nfirm's capitalization activity\n-\nLabor exchange: If the household receives this help we consider it\nas a labor cost of production-thus net income is lower than it\notherwise would be, without the subtraction, and retained earnings\nare lower; at the same time, cumulative net gifts received goes up\nby the amount as the incoming gift\n\nTables removed due to copyright restrictions.\nSee table 4.1 and table 7 in Samphantharak and Townsend (2009).\nhttp://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/economics/econometrics-statistics-and-mathematical-economics/house\nholds-corporate-firms-analysis-household-finance-using-integrated-household-surveys-and-corporate-financial-accounting.\n\nLiquidity Management\n- Statement of Cash Flow\nD = Fl + F2 + ... + Fn\n- Variance decomposition of deficit\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDt - D == I[FI,t - F; J + [F2,t\nF 2 ] + ... + [F ,Dt - Fo J\nL,[D, -Dr == L,[F1,T - PHD, -DJ + L,[F2,T - FHD, -D] + .. . .L L,[F!I,' -FHDT-DJ\nj\ni\ni\nar CD) == COY CD, F ) + COY D, F + ... + COY (D , F,J\n\nCash Flow Deficits and\nMechanisms\n- What deficits?\n-\nOverall deficit C + 1- Y, or C-Y, I-Valone\nMechanisms\n- Decrease in deposits at financial institution\n- Decrease in net ROSCA position\n- Lending (e.g. Loan recall)\n- Borrowing\n- Net gift received\n- Decrease in cash holding\n\nTables removed due to copyright restrictions.\nSee table 4.1 and table 7 in Samphantharak and Townsend (2009).\nhttp://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/economics/econometrics-statistics-and-mathematical-economics/house\nholds-corporate-firms-analysis-household-finance-using-integrated-household-surveys-and-corporate-financial-accounting.\n\nAsset & Liability Management\n- In the previous section, we looked at different devices that\nthe households use to finance their cash shortfall, i.e.\ntheir cash flow deficits\n-\nilliquidity management\"\n- In this section, we turn to another related but different\nissue: how the households manage their asset and liability\ncomposition when they accumulate (or decumulate)\nwealth (net worth) from savings out of net income and\ngifts received\n-\nAnalogous to firm's asset and liability management out of its\nequity (retained earnings and new equity issues)\n\nPortfolio Management continued\n- Again, looking at the variance decomposition\n- Similar to what presented in the previous section\n-\nMain difference is that we would like to explain the co\nmovements of household's wealth accumulation (from\nretained earnings out of net income plus net gifts received)\nand changes in the position of different types of household\nassets and liabilities (as reflected in the balance sheet)\n\n^AwƉSAYƚSAƌAU ΘdZǁYƐGYE;ϮϬϭϮͿDGAƐƵƌsYOƚSG\nreturn on household enterprise: What matters most\nIorǁhomIorthĐominOJournal of Development\nEconomics\n\nCourtesy of Elsevier, Inc., http://www.sciencedirect.com.

(data from previous slide)\nFC\nNFC\n-\nCurrencies\n-Loans\n-\nTrade Credits\n\n-\nFLOW OF FUNDS THROUGH THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS A KEY, NATURAL MEASUREMENT FOR THE\nCONSTRUCTION OF FINANCIAL MODELS: Flow of funds accounts (FFAs) use the traditional sectors\nof the NIPA (firms, household, government, and the rest of the world) and measure financial flows\namong them. There is, however, a heavy reliance on flows of the sectors with financial corporations\nand financial markets, as these are best measured given typical reporting requirements. But that is\na limitation in the measurement, which can be improved, and not a limitation in the\nconceptualization of accounts and their link to standard national income. The latter, NIPA, is the\nbasis for most of the models considered previously (CGE, DSGE). Better measurement adds the\nmechanics of assets and adjustments as a key part of the story. This can and should be done at the\nmicro level (firm, household, financial institution) as well as aggregated up to key sectors,\ndepending on the model or application.\n-\nWHAT ARE FLOW OF FUNDS ACCOUNTS: Essentially, savings comes from income statements and,\nvia an identity, savings (plus gifts and remittances) are put as a flow into real and financial\ninvestments. The portion which is not retained earnings creates a financial flow. Adjustments are\nmade so that income is on a cash flow rather than accrual basis. Roughly, a flow is created by\ndifference over time of the line items in the balances sheets (adjusting for capital gains and losses).\nFlows of funds do often feature the balance sheet directly as well, not just differences and flows.\nThe point: we can see directly the use of financial markets and institutions by asset type.\n-\nTWO TRADITIONS OF FLOW OF FUNDS IN THE LITERATURE:\n- VAR and FFAs- There is relatively recent work by Christiano, Eichenbaum & Evans (2006) which uses VAR with\nFFAs at a detailed level to gauge the impact of monetary policy in the U.S. This digs a bit deeper than the\nimposed sectors and measured flows in their macro financial models, reviewed earlier. Ridhwan et al. (2011) is\na VAR study of the regional impacts of monetary policy in Indonesia using provincial level data on GDP and\ntrade. As the authors note, Indonesia is a diverse, heterogeneous set of islands and a good place to expect to\nfind geographic or sectorial variations in impact and to try to distinguish the interest rate channel from the\nbank lending channel of Bernanke, Gertler, & Gilchrist (they have data on firm size).\n- Demand Equations- There is an older tradition emanating from the seminal work of Brainard & Tobin (1968)\nunderstanding the financial systems through demand equations and costs of adjustment (supply equations or\npolicy variables match the demand). In short, that paper emphasizes the interconnectedness across assets and\nsectors which the flow of funds make explicit. An example of a demand equation approach that takes this into\naccount for policy is a study of Green et al (2012), using flow of funds accounts from the Reserve Bank of India.\n\n-\nMODELING: The interest in this lecture is the use of FFAs for modeling. We can focus on the\nhousehold side, as in some literature, and on the firm side, in other literature. Recent work of\nGuerrieri & Lorenzoni (2011) and Piazzesi & Schneider (2010) uses the flow of funds data from the\nhousehold sector to model financial crisis and to determine the impact of shifts in inflation\nexpectations, respectively.\n- HOUSEHOLD SECTOR AND FINANCIAL DECISIONS: The focus of Guerrieri and Lorenzoni's paper is on the\nhousehold sector and financial decisions (though the instruments and choices are typically restricted,\nexogenously, as in borrowing constraint models). Households consumers solve dynamic stochastic optimization\nproblems by their choice of consumption (durables and nondurables), labor supply (at a wage determined by\nexogenously variation productivity, subject to a Markov process), and saving and borrowing (up to a limit). An\nunexpected, permanent tightening in a consumer borrowing capacity forces borrowers to deleverage and\nsavers to accumulate more buffers, as future borrowing is more limited. This direct and indirect net increase in\nsaving forces the interest rate on bonds (saving accounts) down. In fact, the interest rate overshoots due to\nthe nontrivial distribution of wealth; there is a strong adjustment for those with low wealth. Cuts in\nconsumption and increases in labor supply move output in opposite directions. The consumption effect is\nstronger when there are nominal rigidities. Durable goods adds another asset and another margin of\nadjustment. This model is as applicable to macro as it is to financial access, where, presumably, the process\nruns in reverse, toward liberalization rather than tightening.\n- FLOW OF FUNDS AND CHANGES IN WEALTH: Piazzesi and Schneider's paper draws explicitly on flow of funds\nfor studying large changes in the size and composition of net wealth driven by demographics and expectations.\nIn the U.S. in the 1970's, net worth dropped by 25% on average and the portfolio shifts from equity to real-\nestate dropped by about 20%. The authors attribute these to entry into the market by baby boomers, lower\naggregate saving, increased price of housing, changed expectations, and the erosion of bond portfolio by\nsurprise inflation. The key state variables are the joint distribution of asset holdings and incomes as well as\nheterogeneous expectations. All these are taken from the Survey of Consumer Finances micro data and the\nMichigan Survey of Expectations of Prices and Income. The authors adopt a temporary equilibrium framework\nso that they can equate asset demands to supply (coming from the other sectors in the FFAs) without solving\nforward looking optimization problems.\n\n-\nOTHER PAPERS IN THE HOUSEHOLD TRADITION: Chatterjee et al. (2007) model consumers and\ntheir borrowing subject to understood contingencies that allow them to default on lenders. They\nuse the model to match both micro statistics on bankruptcy and unsecured credit as well as macro\naggregates, earnings, and the distribution of wealth. Livshits et al. (2007) use a life cycle model and\ndirectly parameterize expense shocks.\n-\nFIRMS: A firm financing literature begins with the key financing constraint in representative firm\nmodels of macro (reviewed earlier in this lecture). As reviewed in Chari et al. (2008), there are\nsupposed to be binding collateral constraints, wedges between internal and external funds, and\nfluctuations in these which impact investment. But looking at the U.S. flow of funds, the typical\nnon-financial firm sector is not a net borrower seeking to finance investment or other activities; in\nfact, the firm is paying dividends. Chari et al. (2008) thus argue that we need data on non-financial\nfirms. This is crucial to an understanding of how financial market disturbances affect the broader\neconomy and for learning how to design appropriate regulatory policy for financial markets.\n-\nCONSORTIUM ON FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND POVERTY (CFSP): CFSP is a research organization that\nfeatures a working group on flow of funds with the goal of enhancing measurement and using FFAs\nin models. Many of the papers discussed on this page were featured at a recent conference. More\ninformation on this event, including the proceedings and presentations, can be found at\nhttp://www.cfsp.org/research/workshops/flow-funds-accounts-and-savings-workshop. The\nConsortium has also entered into partnerships with developing countries, including Mexico and\nThailand, to improve flow of funds and their use in models and in policy making.

Traditional FFAs are illustrated by the figure on the left for Thailand,\nand unconventional FFAs (as in the future) are on the right for Thai villages. Both\nof these pictures are possible due to the standardization of measures through\nNIPA. These figures come from Srivisal (2012).\n- WHAT THE FIGURES SHOW: In both figures, deficits and surplus are measured\nrelative to diamonds. On the left, net flows of each traditional sector with the\nformal financial system are shown for various years. Typically, there is a surplus\ngenerated from the household sector (HH) and deficits from the rest of the world\n(ROW). The dividing line between a surplus and a deficit is the edge of the pink\ndiamond. We see variation at the national level over time. On the right, a village in\nthe Townsend Thai Data is running a deficit with the village fund (NIPISH) in cash\nand a surplus in trade credit with outside nonfinancial corporations (NFC).\n- This measurement tells us that economies at various levels are interacting with\neach other, but the exercise is not a substitute for modeling. For example, cash\nplays a large role in mediation in the relationship between a village economy with\nthe outside world. Alvarez et al. (2012) study the transaction demand for cash, i.e.\nwhen to hold and when to go to the bank. Cash is, as observed, a financial\ntransaction on center stage. Holding a lot of cash might suggest transaction costs\nare high. Ultimately, the impact of monetary policy on the village economy will be\ndetermined.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.772 Development Economics: Macroeconomics\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Risk Sharing\nConsider H households, with household h consisting of Ih members. There is a single consump-\ntion good in this economy.\nIndividuals also care about leisure, thus their per-period utility is\nui,h(ci,h, li,h), where i denotes the individual and h denotes the household. This utility function is\ndifferentiable in both arguments and satisfies all usual conditions. Individuals discount the future\nat rate β and maximize expected utility.\nAssume that there exist a countable set of payoffrelevant states of nature St in period t, and\nwe denote a generic state by st (st ∈St). As usual we denote a history by st = (s1, ..., st). The\nprobability of history st is π (st). The sources of individual income are wage income and non labor\nincome. Non-labor income in history st is yi,h (st) and the hourly wage rate as wi,h (st). Note that\nboth income and wages only depend on the current state st.

      "content": "14.772 Macro Development - Problem Set 2\nSpring 2013\nProblem 1: Risk Sharing\nConsider H households, with household h consisting of Ih members. There is a single consump-\ntion good in this economy.\nIndividuals also care about leisure, thus their per-period utility is\nui,h(ci,h, li,h), where i denotes the individual and h denotes the household. This utility function is\ndifferentiable in both arguments and satisfies all usual conditions. Individuals discount the future\nat rate β and maximize expected utility.\nAssume that there exist a countable set of payoffrelevant states of nature St in period t, and\nwe denote a generic state by st (st ∈S\nt\nt). As usual we denote a history by s = (s1, ..., st). The\nprobability of history st is π (st). The sources of individual income are wage income and non labor\nincome. Non-labor income in history st is yi,h (st) and the hourly wage rate as wi,h (st). Note that\nboth income and wages only depend on the current state st. Thus, total wage income of individual\ni in household h and state st will be the wage rate wi,h (st) times the number of units of time\nworked. Each individual has a total time endowment of Ti,h per period. Finally, there is a transfer\nschedule amongst households. Let τh (s) denote the (net) transfer received by household h when\nstate s is realized.\nHousehold Level Analysis\nWe begin by assuming that the risk sharing unit is the household. Assume a unitarian household\nmodel in which allocations are decided as a result of an efficient social-planner-like decision rule\nwith weights μi,h on individual utility functions.\n(1) Write down the program that a household h solves when deciding consumption\nand labor allocations for its members.\nSolution:\nThe household takes the time path of transfers {τh (st)}t as given. Hence, total house-\nhold income after history st is given by\nXh\nst\n= τh\nst\nIh\n+\nX\nyi,h (st) .\ni=1\n\nThe problem of the family is given by\nIh\nh\nmax\ni\nX\nμi,h X\nβtπ st ui,h li,h st , ci,h st\n(1)\n{\nI\nci,h(st),li,h(st)} h\nt\ni\nt i=1\nt,s\ns\nX\nIh\n\nX\nIh\nIh\n\ns.t.\nci,h st +\nwi,h st li,h st =\nwi,h st T i,h + Xh st\nfor all st.\ni=1\ni=1\n\nX\ni=1\n\nAs usual we can solve (1) as a static problem, i.e. for each st,\n\nI\nci,h (st) , li,h (st)\nh\ni\nsolve\nmax\nX\nIh\nμi,hui,h li,h, ci,h\n{ci,h,li,h}\nIh\ni\ni=1\n\n(2)\ns.t.\nX\nIh\nIh\nX\nh\nci,h +\nX\nI\nwi,hli,h =\nwi,hT i,h + Xh,\ni=1\ni=1\ni=1\nwhere I now suppressed the explicit dependence on st.\n(2) Characterize the solution to the allocation problem. Please be explicit on which\nvariables ci,h and li,h depend. Provide a precise intuition why the solution depends on\nthose variables (and why not on some others).\nLet λ be the multiplier on the constraint.\nThe necessary conditions for this problem are\nμi,hui,h\nc\nli,h\n, ci,h\n=\nλ\nμi,h\ni,h\nul\nli,h, ci,h\n=\nλwi,h.\nHence, the allocation between consumption and leisure\n\nis given by\ni,h\nul\nli,h, ci,h\nwi,h\ni,h\n\n=\nu\ni,h\nc\n(3)\n(l\n, ci,h)\nand the consumption allocation across households is given by\nμi,hui,h li,h, ci,h =\n,h\nc\nμg,hug,h\nc\nlg,h, cg\n.\n(4)\nFrom (7) we can express leisure as an\nindividual-sp\n\necific\nfunction\n\nof consumption and the wage\nrate, i.e.\nli,h = φi,h\nHence, we can express (4) as\nci,h, wi,h\n.\n(5)\nμi,hui,h φi,h ci,h, wi,h\ni,h\nc\n\n, c\n\n= μg,hug,h\ng,h\ng,h\ng,h\ng,h\nc\nIn\nφ\nc\n, w\n\n, c\n.\n(6)\nparticular, consider i = 1 so that (6) determines cg,h as a function of c1,h and\n\nthe wage rates\nwg,h and wi,h, i.e.\ncg,h = χg,h c1,h, w1,h, wg,h .\n\nHence,\nlg,h\n=\nφg,h cg,h, wg,h\n=\nφg,h\n\nχg,h c1,h, w1,h, wg,h\n≡\nκg,h c1,h, w1,h, wg,h ,\n\nwg,h\n,\nwhere κg,h is some function specific to individual g.\n\nFrom the budget constraint of (2) we therefore get that\nX\nIh\nIh\nI\nwi,hT i,h + Xh\n=\nX\nh\nci,h +\ni=1\ni=1\nX\nwi,hli,h\ni=1\nIh\nIh\n=\nc1,h + w1,hl1,h +\nX\ncg,h +\nX\nwg,hlg,h\ng=2\ng=2\n=\nc1,h + w1,hφ1,h c1,h, w1,h +\nX\nIh\nχg,h h\nc1,h, w1,h,\ng,h\nI\nw\n+\n\ng=2\nX\nκg,h\ng=2\nc1,h, w1,h, wg,h\n.\nThis is an equation which determines c1,h as a function of a bunch of things, in particular\nc1,h = f 1,h\n\nIh\nw1,h, w2,h, ..., w3,h,\nX\nwi,hT i,h + Xh\n,\ni=1\n\ni.e. consumption depends on all wage rates\n\nw1,h, ..., wIh,h\nand total income\nIh\ni=1 wi,hT i,h + Xh.\nThat consumption only depends on total income and not on its individual components is the usual\nresult. However, now consumption depends on all wage rates of household mem\nP\nbers. This is due\nto the leisure-labor choice encapsulated in (7).\n(3) With your answer to the previous question in mind: what do you think of the\nusual risk sharing regressions? Why might a significant effect of individual income in\nthe consumption regression not be informative about the absence of risk-sharing?\nSolution:\nThis model suggests, that individual income depends on total income and all wage rates.\nIn particular: if consumption and leisure are substitutes (i.e. the marginal utility of consumption is\nhigh if leisure is low), individual consumption will be positively related to the wage rate - if wages\nare high, the individual should work and hence receive consumption due to the complementarity.\nIf the wage rate is positively correlated with personal income, we will find in a regression that\npersonal income is correlated with consumption conditional on aggregate income. This however, is\nan implication of optimal risk sharing.\n(4) Now suppose that consumption and leisure are separable in individuals' prefer-\nences.\nFormally, suppose that ui,h (c, l) = vi,h (c) + qi,h (l) . Which variables determine\nindividual leisure and consumption now?\n\nSolution:\nIf preferences are separable, (7) simplifies to\ni,h\nul\nli,h, ci,h\ni,h\nq\ni,h\n=\nl\nli,h\n= wi,h.\n(7)\nuc\n(li,h, ci,h\n\n)\ni,h\nv\n(ci,h\nc\n\n)\nThis shows that (5) still applies, i.e.\nli,h = φi,h ci,h, wi,h\n.\nAll the other steps to derive the\nconsumption allocation rule did not use the separability between consumption and leisure. Hence,\nindividual consumption allocation depend on the same variables as above despite the separability\nof preferences. But: there is another relation we can use! By looking at (4) right away we get that\nμi,hvi,h\nc\nci,h = μg,hvg,h\nc\ncg,h ,\nfrom which we get that for all i = 2, ..., H\n\nci,h = χi,h c1,h .\nHence, Ch ≡P ci,h = P χi,h c1,h\nso that c1,h = h\nCh\n\nso that we can still write an equation of\nthe form\nci,h = f i,h\n\nCh\n,\ni.e. individual consumption should only depend on aggregate consumption (not aggregate income).\n(5) How could this allocation be decentralized, (assuming that each agent is free to\ndecide how much to work)?\nSolution:\nUnder the usual assumptions on preferences the second welfare theorem applies. Hence,\nthere is an equilibrium with transfers, where individual household members receive endowments ei,h\nand then either trade in Arrow-Debreu markets for state-contingent commodities or simply have a\nfull set of state-contingent one-period assets and markets for labor and the consumption good are\nopen in each state st.\n(6) Does individual labor supply of agent i in household h depend on wages and incomes\nof individuals in the household? Why or why not?\nSolution:\nAs clearly seen from above: individual labor supply is given by\nIh\nT i,h -li,h = T i,h -ζ1,h\n\nw1,h, w2,h, ..., w3,h,\nwi,hT i,h + Xh\ni=1\n\ni.e.\n\nX\n,\nlabor supply depends on wages of other\nP\npeople in the household but not\n\non their non-labor\nincome (conditional on aggregate income\nIh\ni,h\ni,h\nh\ni=1 w\nT\n+X ). The intuition that the wages of other\nindividuals determine labor supply is the same as for consumption: with non-separable preferences\npareto-optimality requires that marginal utilities of consumption are equalized. As this marginal\nutility depends on individual leisure, the labor allocations depend on the distribution of wages in\nthe economy.\n\n(7) Suppose only for this question that the utility function was CARA only in con-\nsumption (i.e.,ui,h(c) = -e-σihc and you would like to identify the risk aversion of agents\nin a household. Could you identify the parameter σih using a regression? Why or why\nnot?\nIf leisure does not enter the utility function, we clearly have li,h = 0, as leisure has the\nprice wi,h. From (6) we have\n1,h -\nσ ,h\nc ,h\n1,h =\ng,h -σg,h\nμ\ne\nσ\nμ\ne\ncg,hσg,h.\nHence,\ng,h\ng,h\n1,h\ncg,h\nμ\nσ\nσ\n=\nln\n+\nc1,h.\nσg,h\nμ1,h σ1,h\nσg,h\nSubstituting this in the budget constraint yields\n\nX\nIh\nh\nwi,h st\nI\nIh\nT i,h + Xh st\n=\nX\nci,h st\n+\nX\nwi,h st\nli,h\ni=1\ni=1\ni=1\nst\nIh\n\n=\nX\nci,h s\ni=1\nt\nIh\n\nI\nμg,h σg,h\nh\n=\nc1,h +\nX\nln\nσ1,h\nσg,h\n\n+ c1,h\nμ1,h σ1,h\ng=2\n\nX\nσg,h\n=\nc1,h\n\nIh\n1 + σ1,h X\nσg,h\ng=2\n!\ng=2\nIh\n+\nX\n1 ln\nσg,h\nμg,h σg,h\nμ1,h σ1,h\nI\n=\n\ng=2\n\n,h\n1,hσ1,h\nI\nh\nh\nμg,h σg\nc\n+\n+\nln\nσ1,h\nX\nσg,h\nσg,h\n=2\n!\nX\ng=2\n\nμ1,h σ1,h\ng\n\nX\nIh\n!\nX\nIh\ng,h\n=\nc1,hσ1,h\nσ\n+\nln\n.\nσg,h\nσg,h\nμg,h\nμ1,h σ1,h\ng=1\ng=2\n\nSolving for consumption yields\n\nIh\n\nX\nIh\nμg,h\n=\nP\nσg,h\nc1,h\nσ1,h\n-\nln\n\n+\n\nX\nwi,h st T i,h\ns\nI\n+ Xh\nt\nh\ng=1\ng,h\nσg,h\nμ1,h σ1,h\nσ\ng=2\ni=1\n\nIh\nμg,h\ng,h\n\nσ\n\n=\nσ1,h\nP\ng=2 σg,h ln\n\nIh\nμ1,h σ1,h\n-\n\nX\nP\n+ P σ1,h\n\nwi,h st T i,h + Xh st\nIh\nIh\ng=1 σg,h\ng=1 σg,h\ni=1\n\n≡\nα1 + P σ1,h\nY h,\nIh\ng=1 σg,h\nwhere Y h is aggregate household income and α1 is a individual-specific fixed effect. This shows\nthat σi,h is not identified - it is only the relative risk aversion (relative to the other household\nmembers), which is identified from a regression. In particular, relatively risk-neutral households\nget a big share of aggregate resources and are therefore subject to a larger part of the aggregate\nrisk in this economy.\n\n(8) Express the indirect utility function of household h, ωh, implicitly. What are the\narguments of the indirect utility function?\nSolution:\nThe indirect utility function of the household is simply the solution to (8), i.e. it is\ndefined by\nωh\nXh st\n,\n\nwi,h st\n\n=\nh\nmax\ni\nX\nIh\nμi,h X\nβtπ st ui,h li,h st , ci,h\nt\ni,t\n{\nI\nci,h(st),li,h(st)} h\ni\ni\nt,st\nt\n=1\ns\nh\nh\n\nh\n\nst\n(8)\nI\ns.t.\nX\nI\nI\nci,h st +\nwi,h st li,h st =\nwi,h st T i,h + Xh st\nfor all st.\ni=1\n\nX\ni=1\n\nX\ni=1\n\nThe indirect utility function depends on the entire sequence of transfers and the entire sequence of\nwages for all family members. Clearly both of these \"objects\" have to be known to solve (8) and\nhence to define the indirect utility function ωh.\nVillage Level Analysis\nWe now assume that the village is the risk sharing unit.\n(9) Set up the planning problem for the village and prove that this problem can be\nsolved by the determination of state contingent transfers τih to maximize the weighted\nsum of household indirect utilities.\nSolution:\nSee my risk sharing notes.\n(10) Characterize the allocation. How would the P\nallocation\nP\nrule differ in two different\nstates, s and s′, that satisfy the following property\nH\nIh\nh=1\ni=1 yi,h (\nH\nI\ns) = P\nh=1\nP h\ni=1 yi,h (s′)?\nSolution:\nSee my risk sharing notes.\n(11) What regression would you run to test for risk-sharing within the family and\nacross families within the village?\nSolution:\nOptimal household risk-sharing requires that individual consumption should not de-\npend on individual income once household income and the wages of the household are controlled for.\nThis restriction can be tested using individual panel data. Risk sharing in the village implies that\nhousehold transfers, i.e. τ h (st) = PIh\ni=1\nci,h (st) -\n\nyi,h (st) + wi,h (st)\nT i,h -li,h (st)\n\n, should\nonly depend on aggregate income once the distribution of wages is controlled for.\n\nPolicy Experiment\nSuppose that a new government comes to power and considers that some of the wages paid in the\nvillage are extremely low. As a result, the government implements an employment income guarantee\nscheme in this village. Effectively, this introduces an outside option of w for all individuals in the\nvillage. Thus all the wages wi,h (st) below w become w.\n(12) Construct an example for which you can characterize the consumption and leisure\nallocations across individuals in closed form (or at least in a way that allows you to\nstudy how these allocation depend on individual wages). How does consumption and\nleisure of the \"affected\" individuals react to the minimum wage? How are the other\nindividuals affected? What drives those results in your example? Do you think those\nresults generalize? [HINT: As I did not tell you what example to pick, there is no\n\"right\" or \"wrong\" in this exercise. Just try to find an example, which works out nicely\nand discuss your findings.]\nSolution:\nSuppose that ui,h (c, l) = ln (c) + ξln (l). Then (3) implies that\nξ\nli,h -\nξci,h\n=\n= wi,h\nci,hξ = wi,hli,h.\n(ci,h)\n\n-1\nli,h\n⇒\nSimilarly, (4) implies that\nμg,h\nμi,h\n= μg,h\ni,h\ncg\n⇒cg,h =\nci,h.\nc\n,h\nμi,h\nHence,\nX\nIh\nIh\nIh\nwi,hT i,h + Xh\n=\ni=1\nX\nci,h +\ni=1\nX\nwi,hli,h\ni=1\nIh\nIh\n=\nc1,h + w1,hl1,h +\nX\ncg,h +\nX\nwg,hlg,h\ng=2\ng=2\nIh\nIh\n=\nc1,h + ξc1,h +\nX\ncg,h + ξ\ng=2\nX\ncg,h\ng=2\nh\n=\n(1 + )\n\nI\nξ c1,h +\nX\ncg,h\ng=2\n\nh\n\nX\nI\nμg,h\n\n=\n(1 + ξ)\nc1,h +\nc1,h\nμ1,h\ng=2\n\n1 +\nIh\nξ\n\n=\nc1,h\nμ1,h\nX\nμi,h,\ni=1\n\nwhich implies that\ni,h\nci,h\n\nIh\nμ\n=\nP\nX\nwg,hT g,h +\n1 + ξ\nIh\nXh\ng,h\ng=1 μ\ng=1\n\n(9)\nli,h\nξ\n=\n\nIh\nμi,h\nP\nX\nwg,h\nwi,h 1 + ξ\nIh\nT g,h + Xh\n=1 μg,h\ng\ng=1\n\nξ\nP\nμi,h\n\n=\nh\n1 + ξ\nIh\n+ X\ng,h\n\nT g,h + Xh +\nX wg,h\nT g,h\n.\n(10)\nwi,h\ng=1 μ\ng=i\n\nLet the policy increase the wages of individual i. From (9) and (10) it is seen that this wage increase\n1. increases consumption of all individuals in the village.\n2. keeps relative consumption levels across individuals constant as (9) implies that\nci,h\nμi,h\n=\n.\ncm,h\nμm,h\n3. reduces leisure of individual i as (10) implies that leisure li,h is decreasing in wi,h\n4. increases leisure of all other individuals as (10) implies that leisure l-i,h is increasing in wi,h\n(due to the income effect)\nMost of the results are likely to be robust to different specifications. That leisure of individual i\ndecreases is intuitive - only if there was a very strong wealth effect in leisure would we expect some-\nthing else. That all consumption levels increase is also intuitive. As there will be more income, at\nleast some consumption level has to increase. That all consumption levels increase can be expected\nfrom the risk-sharing intuition. That relative consumption of individuals is unaffected is of course\nspecial and depends crucially on the separability of preferences, which make relative cosumption\nlevels only a function of the pareto weights μ. That other agents increase their consumption of\nleisure is also intuitive. With consumption being more abundant, the marginal utility of income\ndecreases so that working becomes less attractive. At given wages, labor supply should go down\nbecause of wealth effects on the leisure choice.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n14.772 Development Economics: Macroeconomics\nSpring 2013\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Taking first-order conditions yields\n∂Ls\nσ\n= Psi\nλs\n-\nY\n-1\nσ = 0.\n∂Ysi\n-\nσ\nsi\nThis shows that total costs are given by\nX\nMs\nM\nσ\ns\n-1\nPsiYsi =\nσ\nλs\n-\nσ\ni=1\nX\nY\nσ\nsi\n(9)\ni=1\nand that the demand function is given by\nσ-1\nY\nσ\nσ\nσ-\nsi\n=\n\nλs\n-\nPsi\nσ\n\n.\n(10)\nWe are now going to solve for the multiplier λs.

Note that λs is an endogenous variable\nas seen in (12). It depends on the prices of all other firms and on aggregate demand (the market\nsize Ys). Note also that λs is taken as given by firm si, although it depends on Psi (and hence\non Ysi via the demand function). This is the essence of monopolisitc competition - firms recognize\ntheir market power in their variety i, but they take economywide aggregates as given.\n(c) Use the solution to the firm maximization problem and the expression of Ps to\nderive the formula (15) in the paper.\nSolution First of all, sorry we had to make you go through this, but take it as a lesson for life\n... and enjoy the fact that you are never going to do this again.

To see the relation between these exogenous taxes and\ncredit constraints, suppose that there are no taxes (i.e. τYsi = τKsi = 0) but firm i faces\na credit constraint of the form\nwLsi + ζRKsi ≤W (zsi, η) ,\nwhere zsi is a firm characteristic (e.g.\nwealth), η parametrizes the financial system\nand ζ parametrizes how much of capital expenses can be pledged. Suppose that W is\nincreasing in both argument, i.e. wealthy firms are less constrained and better financial\nsystem are associated with higher values of η. Derive the firm's factor demands taking\nfactor prices as given and aggregate demand as given.\nWhat are the firm-specific\n\"taxes\" in this framework?\nWhich firms face high \"output-taxes τYsi\"?\nUnder what\nconditions would a researcher conclude that τKsi = 0?\nSolution: The firm solves the problem given in part (b) with τYsi = τKsi = 0 but facing the credit\nconstraint. I.e. the profit maximization problem is given by\nσ\nmax\n-1 (Y )\nσ-\nλ\nσ\ns\nsi\nY si,Lsi,Ksi\nσ\n-wLsi -RKsi\nsubject to Y\n= A L1-αs\nsi\nsi\nsi\nKαs and the constraint\nwLsi + RKsi ≤W (zsi, η) .\n\nLetting μ (zsi, η) be the multiplier on the credit constraint, the first order conditions characterizing\nthe firm's factor demand are given by\nσ\nζ\nsi, η)\nλ\n-1\nσ-1\nσ\n+ μ (z\nα Y\n=\nRK\n1 +\ns\nμ (zsi, η)\n\nσ\n\nsi\nsi\nsi\n\n1 + μ (\n\nzsi, η)\n\nσ\n-1\n(1\n)\nσ\nλ\n-1\n-α\nY\nσ\n=\n1 +\n(\n)\ns\nsi\nμ zsi, η\nσ\nsi\nwLsi\nSubstituting the expression for λs, factor demands are\nσ -1\n1 + ζμ (zsi, η)\nα\nμ (zsi, η)\nsiP\n+\nsiYsi\n=\nRKsi\nσ\n1 + μ (zsi, η)\nσ\n\n-1\n\n(1\nα ) P Y\n=\nwL .\n1 + μ (zsi, η)\nσ\n-\nsi\nsi\nsi\nsi\nThe corresponding demand in Hsieh-Klenow are given by\nσ\n(1\nτ\n-\n-\nYsi)\n(1 -αs) PsiYsi = wLsi\nσ\nand\nσ\n(1 -τYsi)\n-1αsPsiYsi = (1 + τKsi) RKsi\nσ\nHence, taxes play exactly the role of the Lagrange multplier of the firm's problem. In particular,\nthe solutions to these problem is identical if\n1 -τYsi = 1 + μ (zsi, η)\nand\n1 + ζμ (z\n1 + τKsi =\nsi, η).\n1 + μ (zsi, η)\nClearly, a high τY firm is one where μ (zsi, η) is high, i.e.\nwhich has a high shadow value of\ninternal funds. With parametrization given above, μ is decreasing in zsi (i.e. if you have more\ncapital to pledge your shadow value of internal funds is lower) and η (as good financial institution\ne.g. allow you to borrow more against each dollar of collateral). Hence, poor firms and firms in\nunderdeveloped regions face binding constraints and will be identified as firms facing high output\ndistortions. Similarly, τKsi is equal to zero, whenever ζ = 1, i.e. if capital and labor are \"equally\npledgable\", the relative tax on capital is zero.\nIf ζ < 1, τK < 0, i.e.\ncapital is the relative\nunconstrained factor and the firm acts as if capital is cheap. Basically: you can borrow against\ncapital but not agains labor. As the production function allows some substitution between labor\nand capital, the firm will produce as higher capital intensities, which Hsieh and Klenow would\nidentify as the firm receiving a subsidy of capital.\n\n[Part II] This part concerns the analysis of equations in Appendix I in the paper.\n(a) Show that TFP = TFPR w\nPγ in which TFPR = PM\nLi\ni=1\nTFPRi\nL\nSoln Firm i solves\nmax πi = (1\nLi\n-τi) PAiLγ\ni -wLi.\nThe FOC is\n(1 -τi) PAiγLγ-1\ni\n=\nw\nso that firm i's output is given by\nw\nYi =\nLi\n.\nPγ\n1 -τi\nAggregate output is given by\nY =\nX\nw\nYi =\nX\nLi\n.\nPγ\ni\n-τi\nAs a result,\nY\nw\nLi\nTFP\n=\n=\nL\nPγ\nL 1 -τi\nw\nL\n=\nX\nPγ\nX\niTFPRi\nL\nw\n=\nTFPR.\nPγ\n(b) Suppose (1 -τi) = a 1\nAi.
