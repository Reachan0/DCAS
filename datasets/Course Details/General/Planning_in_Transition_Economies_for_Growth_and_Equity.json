However, in the common pursuit for economic growth, these transition countries implemented widely different reform strategies with mixed results. With over a decade of empirical evidence now available, this new course examines this phenomenon that has pushed the discourse in a number of disciplines, requiring us to reconsider fundamental issues such as:\n\nthe proper relationship between business, government, and the public interest\n\nthe possible synergies and tensions between economic growth and equity\n\nhow economic transition has reshaped cities\n\nThe premise of the course is that the core issue in transition involves institution-building and re-building in different contexts. Each week this seminar invites leading scholars and practitioners of transition economies in Eastern Europe, CIS, and Asia to present their findings and experience and provide material for our debate and inquiry.\n\nCourse Format\n\nThis course's format is unusual in that it incorporates the Department of Urban Studies and Planning's SPURS luncheon seminar series which has been organized by the course professor. The first half of each class session will meet for the guest lecture that is open to the public. After a short ten-minute break, course participants will re-convene at 2pm for further lecture and discussion.\n\nCourse Text\n\nThe great advantage of this format is that the course readings will highlight the publications of the guest presenters allowing students to directly engage with the authors and those involved in the process of economic transition.\n\nThe course readings will be posted on the class Web site and passed out in class sessions.\n\nAssignments and Grading\n\nStudents have several options. If you would like to take the course pass/fail, you can submit the weekly written responses to the reading and be an active participant in the class discussions.\n\nAll reading responses are due on Friday before class meets. Late submissions will be graded with a penalty.\n\nIf you would like to take this course for a grade, you will also need to submit a final paper.\n\nThe assignments are graded with the following weights:\n\nASSIGNMENTS\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nGRADES\n\nEleven, One-Page Reading Responses\n\n60%\n\nGraded on a scale of 1-20\n\nFinal Paper\n\n40%\n\nLetter Graded\n\nOne-Page Reading Responses\n\nIn an effort to engage with the guest speakers and to promote lively classroom discussion, students will submit one page responses to the assigned reading. In these written assignments it will be impossible to summarize all the reading. Rather, the student should write a response to each class session's discussion questions listed in the course syllabus. Students should also bring additional questions that came to mind while doing the reading to share with the class.\n\nFinal Paper\n\nThe intent of the final paper is to be interesting and educational for the student (not to mention the professor!). While other options are possible after consultation with the professor, the student may pick one of the following two options:\n\nA Report on one Transition Country's Path of Transition\n\nOutline the country-specific pre-transition history and conditions.\n\nOutline and discuss the transition path taken by this country in terms of political\n\nreforms, pacing, phasing, privatization, and other economic reforms as well as macro-economic and international factors that impacted the country's transition.\n\nAssemble, present, and discuss as much empirical evidence of the transition experience as you can. You may want to focus on key economic sectors but justify your selection.\n\n2) A Final Paper on a Specific Urban Planning Problem in the Context of Transition Countries\n\nThese can include housing provision, infrastructure and transportation development, employment, environment, historic preservation, or many other topics. Discussing why the transition poses unique challenges to the selected planning issue and then discuss the issue by comparing how two different transition countries managed it.\n\nThe proposed final paper topic must be submitted by Lecture #4 and approved after Lecture #5. The final paper is due Lecture #11.",

      "content": "William N. Massaquoi\nCourse 11.946\nReading Response # 8\n\nQuestions: What are some of the important characteristics of the ways that firms and\nlocal government interact that are productive for economic development?\n\nThe articles for this week's class clearly point to the importance of an affable relationship\nbetween firms and governments (local or national) because of the potential impact of\nstimulating economic development. In my opinion, there is a set of three key institutions\nthat should be kept healthy in order to create speedy economic development.\nGovernments and private firms are an important part of this development triangle and the\nthird is civil society, which although not explicitly cited in these articles are nevertheless\nimplicitly linked in the chain towards economic development. For the purpose of this\nassignment, I have synthesized three characteristics from the articles in answer to this\nweek's reading assignment. The first characteristic is a good dose of social capital,\nespecially the element of mutual trust and honesty that should oil relations between these\nthree institutions. A balance of power in the political systems is the second and the third\nis transparency and efficiency in government operations.\n\nAll the articles highlight the mutually supporting relationship between firms and\ngovernments. Governments depend on the tax revenue from firms in order to provide\nadequate social services and capital infrastructure. Firms on the other hand need a stable\nenvironment with in which they can conduct their operations with some predictability.\nUncertainty in the operational environment is a threat to any private investment initiative.\nThis is why a great deal of mutual reinforcement between governments and firms is\ncrucial to economy development. This is the main argument in Benno Torgler, article on\n\"Tax Morale in Transition Countries\". He hinges his essay on the intrinsic motivation for\nfirms to pay taxes. In his view trust is the key factor that influences tax moral. According\nto him the best demonstration of this trust can be seen in how strong institutional controls\nand accountability are. He argues \"institutions provide reduction of uncertainty by\ndesigning the structure of interaction\". He also notes \"if government tries to generate\ntrust with well-functioning institutions, co-operation can be initiated or increased\". Put in\nanother way, if firms trust the government and the legal system, then the more they are\nwilling to support the government not only by honoring their tax obligation but also by\nincreasing their level of investment. Torgler illustrates this fact in his research by\nrevealing that in Central and East European countries, trust in the government and legal\nsystem has created a higher tax morale because reforms in those countries have progress\nmuch faster than in Former Soviet Union countries where reforms are slower and hence\ntax morale lower. Also, in explaining the growing size of the unofficial economy,\nJohnson, Kaufmann, MacMilliam, and Woodruff also point out the inadequacy of the\ninstitutional environment as a key factor.\n\nTorgler also raises the issue of transparency and efficiency with which government\nagencies conduct business as another characteristics that can define how interaction\nbetween the government and the private firms can help spur economic development. He\nmentions for example the high transaction costs in registering a business as a case of\ngovernment inefficiency. Such inefficiencies in the form of what he calls \"over-\ngovernment\" or \"under-government\" reduces the incentive for investment and lead to\nhigh level of a shadow economy. He recommends that governments should concentrate\non developing systems (for example tax system) that facilitates rather than complicate\ncompliance.\n\nJohnson, Kaufmann, McMillian and Woodruff agree with Torgler in their article about\nthe need for transparency and efficiency in government operations. They reviewed\nreasons given in current literature on why firms operate in the unofficial economy and\nemphasized amongst other reasons two important factors that point to the lack of\ntransparency and efficiency in governments. One, official regulations are usually onerous\nand two, the high level of predator behavior by government officials (in the form of\nbrides). The authors found evidence in their empirical studies to support these claims.\n\nThe balance of power in the political system comes out heavily in the Vladimir\nGel'man's article on Local autonomy in Russia. The case of balance in the political\nsystem is crucial to ensure that no one individual or group of individuals can control the\nmachinery of state power to the exclusion of other groups, thereby creating instability.\nVladimar uses a case of two cities, Saratov and Pskov in Russia to prove his point.\nGel'man's showed that Pskov succeeded in political autonomy due to competitive voting\nfor the political machinery where as Saratov failed to achieve autonomy because non\ncompetitive voting resulted into a zero-sum game to the benefit of the governor,\nAyatskov. Gel'man's point is that a competitive political privilege is possible only to\nthe extent that they are allowed by local autonomy and he encapsulates this point as\nfollow: \"The formation of local autonomy not only depends upon the emergence of local\ndemocracy, but also strengthens it. The lesson here is that because cities are mediators of\neconomy development to the rest of the country, the more stable they are politically the\nbetter their ability to attract investment or stimulate innovation.\n\nTo conclude, a balance in the political system that ensures confidence in the institutions,\nfor example the legal system, and the commitment of government officials to be\ntransparent and efficient encourages and strengthens a better private sector engagement\nthat eventually lead to a healthy economic development agenda."

      "content": "Discussion Questions: What are some answers to Mark Granovetter's call for integrating\nsuch different ideas about key institution necessary for transition to market economy? What\ncould be the benefit to such an integration?\n\nThe basic tenet of his argument is the analysis of the economy as an institution should not merely\nbe founded on the economic perspectives (rational and self interest driven) but also should be\nsupported by sociological analysis (explanation of political actions, science and knowledge, family\nand kinship and other social pattern ). Thus economic sociology, by combining economic and\nsocial purposes, tries to explain the rational for the motivation of people in the process of\nproduction, consumption or distribution of goods and services. In this process the motive of\nindividuals is the result of both pure self interest and social context. The social context is\ncharacterized by\n- horizontal relation which is based on trust and solidarity and promote cooperation and\n- vertical relation which is based on power and compliance leading to domination and\ncompliance\nThese relationships have varying repercussion on the economy and institutions, in his words\ninteraction and cooperation as against intersection and compliance.\nThe issue is then,\n- What are institutions and which are considered to be the key institution necessary for the\nmarket economy?\n- And how do such institutions behave in order to facilitate the transition to market\neconomy?\n- What is the relevance of his argument to institutions necessary for transition to market\neconomy?\nInstitution are defined as \" a set of humanly devised behavioral rules that govern and shape\ninteractions of human beings , in part by helping them to form expectations of what others people\ndo\" (Lin and Nugent in Dani Rodrik) and in the same paper Rodrik identifies the key institutions or\nsocial arrangements necessary transition to market economy, namely\n- A clearly delineated system of property rights (no free rider in Mark Granovetter's\nargument) ,\n- A regulatory apparatus curbing the worst form of fraud and anti competitive behavior and\nmoral hazard (shared values and norms in Mark Granovetter's argument),\n- A moderately cohesive society exhibiting trust and social cooperation (horizontal\nrelationship in Mark Granovetter's argument) ,\n- The presence of social and political institutions that mitigate risk and manage social\nconflicts (negotiation in Mark Granovetter's argument) and\n- The rule of law and clean governance (democracy in Mark Granovetter's argument)\n\nThrough the integration of economics and sociology, the so called the theory of economic\nsociology, Granovetter tries to analyze the different types of relationship and the importance of\nsocial construction of economic institutions.\nHe emphasizes the free flow of information, resource and ideas (porous interaction among\ninstitutions) as a very desirable for the success of the economy. Negotiation, dialogue and cross\ncutting ties promote democracy and entrepreneurship (he sites the examples of Fiat and Alfa\nRomeo in Italy in the 70's and 80's in approaching conflicts and the outcomes as well as the\nsuccess of the Silicon Valley /venture capital/ to demonstrate his argument.)"

      "content": "Discuss the challenges of privatizing state - owned enterprises in the\ntransition countries - What extra challenges might they face compared to\nother countries?\nBerhanu Woldetensae\nPrivatization, which is the \"deliberate sale by a government of a State - Owned\nEnterprises (SOE) or assets to private economic agent\", is a part of the\nrestructuring process underway in transition economies and other developing\ncountries as a move towards market economy. Privatization is, as empirical\nstudies suggest, brings a long term increase productive growth. Moreover, the\nsale SOE's will generate revenues for the governments, which is the driving force\nfor privatization by governments in most countries.\nThere are different methods of privatization, namely\n- Privatization through restitution: The return of property to former owners\ncould be complicated in the absence of prove of ownership\n- Privatization through the sale of state property: Either as direct sale or\nShare Issue Privatization (SIP). The choice will depend on the degree of\ndevelopment of the capital market\n- Mass or Voucher privatization\n- Privatization from below\nThe process of privatization requires the realization of a number of preconditions\nand these are:\n- Setting up of a structure of privatization (example legislation)\n- Providing of adequate performance records of the SOE\n- Developing any necessary new regulatory structure\n- Determining the appropriate post - sale relation between firm and the\ngovernment\nAssuming all the preconditions are fulfilled, the challenges of privatization are;\n- When to privatize\n- Decision on the speed of privatization: privatize rapidly (\"big bang\" in\nformerly Soviet Block) or slowly (China)\n- Restructuring of SOE before or after sale\n- Determination of prices for assets: Auction or negotiation\n- The how of the transfer of control (all or part) in Share Issue Privatization\n(SIP)\nThe extra challenges faced by the transition countries in the process of\nprivatization in comparison with similar process in industrialized countries or non\n- transition countries is that privatization in transition economies is a part of the\nall-inclusive change from centrally planned communist system to market\noriented system of allocation resources and organizing production. This process\nhad been complicated by the poorly developed capital markets in all the\ntransition economies and the break up of Soviet union in formerly Soviet\nRepublics."

      "content": "MIT Course 11.946 Planning in Transition Economies for Growth and Equity\nProfessor: Annette M.Kim\nby Assel Nussupova, Brandeis University student\n\nDiscuss the challenges of privatizing state-owned enterprises in the transition countries - what extra\nchallenges might they face compared to other countries?\n\nThe challenges of privatizing state-owned enterprises in some transition countries could be reviewed\nthrough results of privatization reforms, which received a very negative score and opinion. For\nexample, the Russian privatization program is criticized that 1) privatization was implemented too\nrapidly without appropriate institutional preparation and legislation; 2) privatization weakened state\npower, eroded public order, and caused corruption; 3) privatization did not create real owners of\nproperty, and, in fact, all (or almost all) the property that was privatized had a criminal element (See,\nfor example, Stiglitz J. Whither Reform? Washington D.C.: The World Bank, 1999)\nThough the reality in Russia as well as other transition countries was very specific and different from\nwhat its critics saw, I agree that \"there are some important preconditions that have to be satisfied\nbefore privatization can contribute to an economy's growth (Stiglitz J. Globalization and its\nDiscontents. W.W Norton& Company, 2003).\nAccording to conclusions made by William L.Megginson and Jeffrey M.Netter in their survey\n\"From State to Market: A Survey of Empirical Studies On Privatization\" (Journal of Economic\nLiterature 39 (2):321-389) \"it has been clear that the success of the privatization program depends on\nthe strength of the markets within the same country, and vice versa\". Thus, they emphasize, 'the\nimpact of privatization will differ across countries depending on the strength of the existing private\nsector\". It is also mentioned that the effectiveness of privatization depends on institutional factors,\nsuch as the protection of investors.\nOne more very important issue raised by all the authors of the assigned readings (as well as by many\ncritics of market-oriented reforms in transition economies) is the impact of privatization on\nemployment I agree that privatization leads to restructuring, which means the destruction of\nunproductive jobs, which are replaced by new more productive jobs (These ideas are considered by\nBilsen V. in \"Job Creation, Job Destruction, and Growth of Newly Established, Privatized, and\nState-Owned Enterprises in Transition Economies: Survey Evidence from Bulgaria, Hungary, and\nRomania\", Journal of Comparative Economics 26 (3):429-445).\n\nBut I would like to emphasize the problem of so-called \"social costs\" associated with\nunemployment, which private firms often do not take into account. Privatization has been so widely\ncriticized because privatization often destroys jobs rather than creating new ones. According to J.\nStiglitz, \"in industrialized countries, the pain of layoffs is acknowledged and somewhat ameliorated\nby the safety net of unemployment insurance. In less developed countries, the unemployed workers\ntypically do not become a public charge, since there are seldom unemployment insurance schemes'\n(Stiglitz J. Globalization and its Discontents. W.W Norton& Company, 2003, p. 57).\nThe general conclusion is that attempts of privatizing state-owned enterprises in many transition\ncountries were failed because privatization had not been considered as a part of a more\ncomprehensive program aimed to build appropriate institutions and create preconditions for\nsuccessful privatization'.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Or is there some more appropriate way to categorize\ntransition? What is accounting for the difference?\n\nWing Thye Woo, addresses this issue by questioning the notion that\ngradualism is better than the \"big bang\" as some have argued as the main\ncharacteristic that differentiates China's successful transition from the poor\nresults we see in Eastern European countries and Russia. He argues that\ngradual reform in China was not an economic strategy as such but rather a\nresult of disagreement between proponents of the market economy and\nthose still holding strong to Stalinist dogma. Woo contends forcefully that the\nlack of progress in Economic transition in Eastern European countries is not\nthe result of applying the \"big bang\" (or rapid) as opposed to China's\ngradualism. He cites the case of Vietnam, that implemented \"gradual\npolicies\" similar to China's but failed to achieve Chinese-styled results. He\nalso argues the reform process in Russia was by no means a \"big bang\", yet\nit has not produced the necessary results.\n\nWoo attributes the differences in economic performance between China and\nthe Eastern European countries to the structure of existing economies in\nthese countries. For example, he draws attention to the fact that the reform\nproblem in China is a classic case of moving surplus agricultural labor into\nindustries while those of Eastern European countries and Russia is a classic\nadjustment problem of moving employed labor from uncompetitive industries\nto newly emerging efficient industries. Simply put, China started with\nagricultural reforms because the sector employed most of it labor while\nEastern European countries choose industrial reforms due precisely to the\nsame reason.\n\nWoo further argues against the notion of optimal sequencing, i.e. that\neconomic reforms should be preceded by institutional reforms. According to\nWoo, China's experience contradicts this claim, pointing out that the absence\nof institutions that reliably secure a broad range of contracts and property\nrights has not necessarily impeded China's transition. But Dani Rodrik would\nrespond that there were indeed institutional reforms but not as they are\nprescribed by western countries. For example, private firms can set their own\nprices above excess goods beyond state quotas and foreign investors can\nrepatriate profits and won land in costal china. Yet still Woo might also point\nout other sequencing recipes that have been contradicted. For example, the\nwell-known recipe of liberalizing the goods markets first, second the\ndomestic financial system, and third the capital accounts transactions have\n\nbeen contradicted by Indonesia, which implemented reforms in the reverse\nsequence and yet has performed very well.\n\nWoo once again would argue that reforms depends on structure of the\neconomy and the political and economic direction the country is seeking. For\nexample, reform policies implemented by Poland can be explained by the\ndesire to join the European Union, which apparently accounts for why it is\ndoing well as compared to Russia for example.\n\nRoberts and Zhou agree that there can be no universal consensus on policy\ndos and don'ts. They agree with Woo that reforms depends on the context or\nthe configuration of conditions to which reforms contributes. But they\nsuggest that economic growth and the rule of law will enhance new\nEnterprise Development.\n\nFor his part Svejnar thinks that geography-related initial conditions have\nbeen important in the transition process, particularly the initial recession\nfaced by most countries made it difficult for most transitional countries to do\nwell. Svejnar suggests that Transition countries further east have on average\nPerformed worse than their more western counterparts. However, Svejnar\npoints out the fact that the western-most transition economy, the Czech\nRepublic, has performed worse than others since the mid-1990s indicates\nthat geography does not provide a complete explanation and that policies do\nmatter\".\n\nSvejnar agree with Roberts and Zhou on the question of the rule of law and\nargues that the reform of greatest importance seems to be that countries\nthat placed emphasis on the development of legal framework and corporate\ngovernance like Hungary, Poland and Slovenia, have performed better than\nthose that did not, like the Czech Republic, Russia and Ukraine. Frye and\nShleifer also agree that it is the ability of the Polish government to enforce\nlaw and regulations despite similar economic conditions that accounts for\nPoland success over Russia.\n\nWoo and Svejnar seem to have opposing views but I believe that there does\nappear to be reconciliation between the two. For one thing, Woo points out\nthat China has performed the most in areas where reforms were most\nradical. And Svejnar would point out that Poland and Hungary are both two\nexamples of countries that implemented radical reforms (due to the\nimperative of wanting to join the EU), which explains their progress. When\none considers this point in light of Dani Rodrik's view that reforms have taken\nplace in China (although not in the form suggested by western economist)\nand David Woodruff's explanation on better corporate governance as a\nreason for Poland's better performance over Russia, one tend to reach the\nconclusion that institutional reforms of some sort based on the structure of\nthe economy and the political and legal structures that sustain them is a\ngood precondition to good reform."

      "content": "Shahid Sadruddin Nanavati\nResponse #4\n\nDiscussion Questions: Does there seem to be an Asian style of transition versus\nEuropean style? Or is there some more appropriate way to categorize\ntransitions? What is accounting for the differences?\n\nTaking the middle question first, of how to categorize transitions?:\n\nThe experiences of the Central and the Eastern European countries show that the costs of\ntransition from a planned to a market economy can be substantial. Most countries undergoing\nsuch a transition suffered a sharp drop in output and employment and increased social and\npolitical instability in the early phase of their transition (Siebert, 1991: 14-16). Some countries\nlike the former Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia even disintegrated politically under the\nreform pressures. In contrast, the Chinese transition appears to be relatively smooth. With the\nexception of the Tiananmen Square tragedy in 1989 China has so far not incurred any serious\npolitical or social upheaval. Economically it not only experienced no drop in output and\nemployment during the transition but actually saw an increase in output at an annual average\nrate of over 9 per cent over the last 15 years. Thus the Chinese reform model is very often\nconsidered superior to other transition models and extolled as the model for other socialist\ncountries. (Chai 1)\n\nBrezis and Schnytzer say that: there has been a marked difference in the transition dynamics\nwhich have taken place over the past decade between Eastern Europe on one hand, and China\nand Vietnam on the other. The latter countries have introduced successful market-oriented\nprivatizing reforms in the presence of communist dictatorships which show no signs of\nweakening. In Eastern Europe, however, the collapse of communism went hand in hand with\neconomic reforms.\n\nAs per Woo Thye and Richard Philips, China began its privatization policy by introducing a\nmarket economy, that is, by creating a non-state sector consisting of non-state enterprises,\nwhere privatization refers merely to the introduction of some private enterprise into the\neconomy. For example, enacting a law which allows an artisan to become self employed is a\nform of privatization. This type of privatization is considered to be rather primitive: This\nmeaning of privatization was relevant to developments in Eastern Europe less than three to five\nyears ago. Now ... for the most part Eastern European economies have moved far beyond these\ninitial stages. Thus, in the context of Eastern Europe, privatization means the transfer of state-\nowned enterprises to private ownership.... For example, in Czechoslovakia, Poland and\nHungary, the term privatization is generally used to refer to a specific program for the\nwholesale divestment of state enterprises. However, in other states, which have not progressed\nas far towards a Western style economy (for example Romania and Albania), privatization may\nmerely refer to the efforts of individual state-owned enterprises to introduce an element of\nprivate ownership or to create a joint venture with private firms.\n\nShahid Sadruddin Nanavati\nResponse #4\n\nWhether privatization is to involve merely the introduction of some elements of a market\neconomy or the actual privatization of state enterprises, privatization, in the environment of the\ntransitional economies, is not a simple transfer of ownership from state to private individuals.\nIt is rather a process by which the very institution of property is introduced to economy. These\neconomies require not only the restructuring of the economy but also the creation of private\nproperty and the institutions of a market economy, while ensuring a maximization of economic\ngrowth and a minimization of social, economic, and political disorder.\n\nChina, by contrast, has pursued the exact opposite strategy. Chinese reformers deferred state-\nsector privatization and focused on establishing the fundamentals of a market-oriented\neconomy - in other words, a working market--in the newly created non-state sector (as per Jun\nQian - seminar notes). However, in the Chinese context, a market-oriented economy that\nfunctions on commercial rather than politicized terms has been established, unfortunately, only\nin the non-state sector - hence the rapid growth and increased productivity of non-state\nenterprises. The Chinese state sector, on the other hand, continues to languish despite state-\nsector privatization because of the absence of key institutional mechanisms necessary to make\nprivatization work.\n\nPolitical and ideological considerations were among the factors that prompted Russia and\nmany Eastern European countries to engage in speedy and mass privatization of state-owned\nenterprises and China to favour insulation of the state sector from private economic\nencroachments and preservation of social ownership.\n\nECONOMIST, Sept. 18, 1999, at 81 says that China took a politically induced path that\nallowed it to avoid many of the economic problems associated with Russian privatization. As\nthe World Bank's chief economist has noted recently in his controversial critique of the IMF's\nrole in Russian privatization \"those who put privatization above all else were clearly wrong ....\n[They] thought that you had to pursue privatization, and infrastructural change would follow.\nThey thought that the new owners of private property would demand that this happen.

To date, much of the research on emerging\nfirms in transitioning economies attributes the prevelance of \"unofficial activity\" (i.e., officially\nregistered firms who avoid accurately reporting their output and profits to the state) to four main\ndiscentives for firms to operate in the formal sector: high profit tax rates; lack of faith in the legal\nsystem to enforce formal contracts; corruption within the government; and harassment by mafia-\ntype groups (Johnson, et al).\nThe Johnson and Torgler articles both examined these attributions in more detail, but their\napproaches reflect different premises. Johnson's firm-level study attempted to measure the\ncorrelation between unofficial activity and all the aformentioned disincentives. They found the\nstrongest correlation to be with the firms' desire to avoid bribe payments demanded by corrupt\ngovernment officials (though direction of causality was undetermined). Torgler's study, however,\nfocused in on examining the link between taxes and unofficial activities through probing the\nconcept of citizen's \"tax morale\". He concluded that (dis)trust in the government was the main\ndeterminant in firms' (un)willingness to accurately report their profits and pay the according taxes.\nAlhough these two studies investigated different questions, both point to government corruption as\na major disincentive for firms to operate transparently -- and therefore as an overall barrier to\neconomic development through less investment, less tax revenue, and greater market distortions\nthat further aggravate inefficiencies.\nGel'man's article shed light on the government side of the firm-state paradigm through his\nanalysis of local governance in Russia. His case studies highlighted the impact of contentous\nversus collaborative, intra-elite, political arrangements on the level of local governmental autonomy\nwithin the context of political (vertical vs. horizontal integration) and economic (localism vs.\ndepartmentalism) preconditions. The legacy of socialist planning was also referenced by Hsing's\nseminar talk in order to identify key problems in adopting capitalist planning models (ie, fragmented\npolitical environments in which government officials have more incentive to captialize on newly\nvalued land through speculative/transaction-heavy market tactics then to invest in sustainable\neconomic and institutional development).\nIn light of the discussion on growth-inducing, firm-state interactions, a couple of extra points\ncame to mind while reading these articles. First, the ability of local governments to assume\nmarket-oriented roles and responsibilities depends heavily on the kind of institutional and\nadministrative capacity that is under-developed in these transitioning contexts. This capacity-\nbuilding process should be closely linked with the needs of firms -- not only to boost short-term\ngrowth but also, as Torgler argued, to boost morale and trust through private sector participation in\na democratic system. Another point pertains to culture and norms and the importance of\nconsidering the contextual norms of a particular country in the design of the institutional\nrestructuring. The Russian cases borrowed a western model that stemmed from practices that\nwere not embedded in Russian society."

In it's ideal form, FDI can provide not only\naccess to capital, technology, and external markets, but can also create jobs and support\nnetworks of information and agreements that encourage greater production. However, critics such\nas Stiglitz warn about the different types of FDI that impact growth: \"greenfield\" investments that\ncreate jobs and wealth, versus exploitation through asset stripping (which can leave an area ever\npoorer than before the investment).\n\nHuang and Di's 2003 paper raised some interesting points about the validity of attributing growth to\nthe FDI factor. They argued that relying on FDI or risk assessments as major variables in growth\noverlooks the host-country context, and that examining domestic firm's ownership structures of FDI\nprojects (rather than the more common foreign-to-domestic approach that focuses on flow of\ninvestment) reveals more significant and consistent signs of growth. By examining how China's\ninstitutional environment impacted ownership, they discovered a negative correlation between\nlevels of institutional liberalization and foreign ownership of joint ventures.\n\nOf the many ideas raised in the articles, three main factors related to understanding the role of FDI\nin transition countries stand out: scale of analysis (regional variation), rate and sequencing of\ngovernment reform, and the institutional climate. Huang emphasized the importance of sensitivity\nto the scale of analysis by highlighting regional level variations in FDI's influence on economic\ngrowth and the political motivations that may or may not support domestic firms' interests. One\ncase in point is that of the Malaysian government's attempt to drown out Chinese entrepreneurs by\nflooding the national market with FDI. The argument about the rate of transition reform wavers\nbetween two ends of a spectrum: gradualism versus shock therapy. The best formula depends on\nthe institutional context and the political feasibility (the political status of domestic business in the\ngovernment), and poses a trade-off between the depth of shock (severity of reform) and length of\ncrisis. Huang's 2004 paper discussed evidence that foreign firms' regulatory advantages are\nespecially substantial when compared to the politically weak domestic firms, and especially so in\ncorrupt countries versus non-corrupt countries.\n\nextra thoughts...\nIn lieu of last week's discussion on firms' widespread unreported business activities, I wonder how\nthese authors account for the enormity of the \"shadow sector\" in their assessments and growth\nprojections. This undoubtedly speaks to the great challenge of conducting research or obtaining\naccurate information in such restricted environments, and I was gratified by Huang's open\ndiscussion of shortcomings in the data collection methodology and general speed bumps in the\nresearch process."

      "content": "Shahid Sadruddin Nanavati\nResponse 5\n\n.Discussion Questions: Discuss the challenges of privatizing state-owned\nenterprises in the transition countries - what extra challenges might\nthey face compared to other countries?\n\nAnswering the latter part of the question first:\nBefore the collapse of communism many countries dismantled their authoritarian regimes\nand relaxed their administrative grip over economic activity. Under the weight of the debt\ncrisis crippling their economies in the 1980s, many Latin American countries introduced\ndemocratic reforms, made leaders accountable to their constituents, and liberalized their\neconomic regimes (Richard M. Phillips, 1999). In fact, most of the world's economies\nhave, at different times, paces, and with varying degrees of success, removed\nadministrative controls over prices, liberalized access to their markets, and privatized\nstate-owned enterprises.\nNow, the question is: what is unique about the new transition countries?\nWhat clearly distinguishes the transition of previously communist regimes is its\ninstitutional point of departure. While communist ideologues were different, communism\nwas a distinct system - its institutional design, predicated on the aspiration of the state to\ncontrol totally both society and the economy, explicitly rejected the relative autonomy of\nsociety, state, and economy. There was no room for law, democracy, or competitive\nmarkets. These concepts were dysfunctional under communism (Blinder A., 1990).\n\nThe challenge that stood in-front of the newly independent states (except Russia) had to\nbuild their states from scratch and establish their economic sovereignty, including\ndomestic currencies, border controls, etc. Then the weak institutional capacities of the\nstate negatively impact prospects for a quick and smooth transition. Establishing market-\nsupporting institutions and stabilizing the economy was not an easy task. Weak\ninstitutional capacity creates an environment conducive to corruption and both organized\nand unorganized crime (Richard M. Phillips 1999).\nAnother difficulty is the lack of a transportation network that could link the new\neconomies with international markets. The problem is less serious for European newly\nindependent states, but it is especially grave for landlocked Asian newly independent\nstates (Richard M. Phillips 1999).\nAlso military conflicts in Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, and Tajikistan are added\nchallenges to the economies and their neighboring economies too (Balcerowicz L. 1995).\nNow discussing the challenges of privatizing state-owned enterprises in the transition\ncountries\nA central feature of successful market economies is a well-functioning financial system\n(Keane and Prasad 2002, Steve Jones, et.al., 1999). In almost all countries in transition,\n\nShahid Sadruddin Nanavati\nResponse 5\n\nhowever, financial systems suffer from deep-seated weaknesses. Although privatizations\nis primarily an economic issue, but at the same time it is a highly political act.\nPrivatization represents an ideological and symbolic break with a history of state control\nover a country's productive assets. It mainly involves societal shifts from a planned\neconomy and state monopoly to a market economy and private ownership (Steve Jones,\net.al., 1999). In developed capitalist countries, however, it primarily involves the\nsubstitution of alternative management structures for public ones whose aim is to\nimprove the delivery of targeted public services (public utilities, corrections, education,\nsocial welfare, schools, or health care). Privatization in transit countries is crucial to\nbalance public and private ownership (Keane, et.al. 2002). So far, however, the methods\nof mass privatization have not promoted fair and just distributions of income, wealth,\npower; better standard of living etc. as seen in the last few discussions. For privatization,\nextensive restructuring efforts are required and the same are not done because they could\ncause a major shift of power from the government to non-government spheres (June Gary\nHopps, 1998).\n\nThis maybe a repeated argument/ statement from the previous response, but it is\nimportant to note that, whether privatization is to involve merely the introduction of some\nelements of a market economy or the actual privatization of state enterprises,\nprivatization, in the environment of the transitional economies, is not a simple transfer of\nownership from state to private individuals. It is rather a process by which the very\ninstitution of property is introduced to economy These economies require not only the\nrestructuring of the economy but also the creation of private property and the institutions\nof a market economy, while ensuring a maximization of economic growth and a\nminimization of social, economic, and political disorder (per Woo Thye and Richard\nPhilips).\nThus the challenges of privatizing state-owned enterprises in the transition countries are\nmanifold.\nReferences\n- Richard M.

      "content": "Journal of Economic Perspectives--Volume 16, Number 1--Winter 2002--Pages 3-28\nTransition Economies: Performance\nand Challenges\nJan Svejnar\nT\nhe collapse of the Soviet political and economic system in the late 1980s,\nepitomized by the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, culminated\nthe dramatic economic slowdown experienced by the Soviet bloc coun\ntries over the preceding three decades. The resulting transition from central\nplanning to a market economy has been difcult. The performance of the transi\ntion economies has fallen short of expectations for several reasons: advanced\nWestern economies did unusually well in the 1990s, which raised the bar for\nperceptions of economic success; the economic problems associated with the\ntransition were widely underestimated; and policymakers made a number of ques\ntionable choices. Nevertheless, progress has been made in a number of dimensions.\nIn this paper, I provide an overall assessment of the strategies and outcomes of\nthe rst dozen years of the transition, as well as an outline of the principal\nchallenges faced by these economies. In presenting data and examples, I focus\nprimarily on comparing the experience of the ve central European countries--the\nCzech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia--with the experience of\nRussia. The ve central European countries have a combined population of over\n65 million people and were the rst to launch the transition. Russia, with its\npopulation of 145 million, is the principal country of the former Soviet Union and\nnow of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which is made up of\ncountries that were formerly republics of the Soviet Union, and it has had a very\ndif cult experience with transition. I will also make a number of references to three\nother groups: the three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, with a\ny Jan Svejnar is Executive Director of the William Davidson Institute, Everett E. Berg\nProfessor of Business Administration and Professor of Economics, all at the University of\nMichigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. He is also Chair of the Executive and Supervisory\nCommittee, CERGEEI, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\ncombined population of 7.5 million, which became part of the Soviet Union only\nat the outset of World War II and in the 1990s staged a relatively fast transition; the\nBalkan or southeast European countries of Albania, Bulgaria and Romania, com\nbined population 34 million, which have not been affected by war or other\ncon icts; and Ukraine, as the second largest economy of the former Soviet Union\nand now the CIS, with its population of 50 million. I will not discuss, except\nin passing, the many other countries of the CIS: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,\nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\nI also will not focus on the countries of the former Yugoslavia, since their form\native experiences of the 1990s involve war and civil strife rather than economic\ntransition.\nThe Sovietstyle centrally planned system was relatively well suited to mobiliz\ning resources for expanding existing productive activities during World War II and\nthe postwar reconstruction, although it also suppressed human rights and imposed\ngreat human suffering. The Soviet bloc countries achieved a 4.5 percent annual\ngrowth rate in per capita GNP during the 1950s, exceeding the 3.7 percent rate of\ngrowth of a comparison group of market economies (Gregory and Stuart, 1997).1\nHowever, the rigidities of the command economy made it much less suitable for\ninvention, innovation and efcient allocation of resources, resulting in a longterm\nslowdown in the entire Soviet bloc since about 1960. While the comparison group\nof market economies averaged rates of growth of GNP per capita of 4.5 percent in\nthe 1960s, 2.8 percent in the 1970s and 2 percent in the 1980s, the growth of per\ncapita GNP of the Soviet bloc countries is estimated to have fallen to 3.6 percent in\nthe 1960s, 2.8 percent in the 1970s and 0.8 percent in the 1980s.\nThe fall of communism created expectations that the centrally planned econ\nomies, as they moved to a market system, would generate rapid economic growth\nand gradually catch up with middleincome developed countries. These expecta\ntions were tempered by anxiety over (presumably temporary) high rates of in ation\nthat were being observed in Poland and in the disintegrating Yugoslavia in the late\n1980s and by the knowledge that transition would not happen overnight.\nStrategies for Transition\nThe policymakers in the former Soviet bloc formulated transition strategies\nthat focused on macroeconomic stabilization and microeconomic restructuring,\nalong with institutional and political reforms. The implementation of these strat\negies varied across countries in speed and specics. A major debate took place\nabout the merits of fast or \"big bang\" reform versus gradual reform. But as it turned\n1 In Gregory and Stuart (1997), the Soviet bloc includes all the states of the Soviet Union, plus Bulgaria,\nCzechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania. The market economies in the sample\ninclude Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,\nNorway, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States and West Germany.\n\nJan Svejnar\nout, almost all the transition governments plunged ahead in rapid \"big bang\" style\nwith what I will call Type I reforms. However, signi cant policy differences ensued\nin what I shall term Type II reforms, which only some governments carried out.2\nType I reforms typically focused on macro stabilization, price liberalization and\ndismantling the institutions of the communist system. The macroeconomic strategy\nemphasized restrictive scal and monetary policies, wage controls and, in most\ncases, also a xed exchange rate. The micro strategy was to move quickly toward\nprice liberalization, although a number of key prices, like those of energy, housing\nand basic consumption goods, often remained controlled along with wages and\nexchange rates. The institution governing the Soviet bloc trading area, the Council\nfor Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), was abolished, and most countries\nopened up rapidly to international trade, thus inducing a more ef cient allocation\nof resources based on world market prices. Most countries also quickly reduced\ndirect subsidies to trusts and stateowned enterprises and allowed them to restruc\nture or even break up. They removed barriers to the creation of new rms and\nbanks and carried out smallscale privatizations. Moreover, early on, most govern\nments broke up the \"monobank\" system, whereby a single state bank (or a system\nof tightly knit but nominally independent banks) functioned as a country's central\nbank as well as a nationwide commercial and investment bank, and instead allowed\nthe creation of new and independent banks. A nal feature was the introduction of\nsome elements of a social safety net. These changes caused a sizable reallocation of\nlabor away from the staterun rms, some of which went to the new private rms\nand some of which ended up in nonemployment. The Type I reforms proved\nrelatively sustainable and were associated with improving economic performance in\ncentral Europe (except the Czech Republic) and in the Baltic countries, whereas\nthey were much less successful in Russia, the other countries of the Commonwealth\nof Independent States and the Balkans.\nType II reforms involved the development and enforcement of laws, regula\ntions and institutions that would ensure a successful marketoriented economy.\nThese reforms include the privatization of large and mediumsized enterprises;\nestablishment and enforcement of a marketoriented legal system and accompany\ning institutions; further indepth development of a viable commercial banking\nsector and the appropriate regulatory infrastructure; labor market regulations; and\ninstitutions related to public unemployment and retirement systems.\nThe differences in the ability of transition governments to carry out Type I and\nType II reforms seemed to turn on two factors: their ability to collect taxes with\nwhich to nance public programs and their ability to minimize corruption and\nrentseeking behavior. Type I reforms generally seek to cut off subsidies and to\nreduce centrally planned regulation. Since many transition governments had great\n2 The \"big bang\" versus gradualism debate is also relevant in comparing the former Soviet bloc to China.\nChina proceeded gradually even with respect to Type I reforms, and it also avoided the initial recession\nexperienced by all transitio n economies in central and eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States.\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\ndif culty in setting up a reliable tax system, cutting off subsidies and reducing the\nscope of government was almost forced upon them. However, Type II reforms\nemphasize that transition requires not only the withering away of an omnipresent\ndictatorial state, but also a creation of a reliable state apparatus that provides a level\nplaying eld for the market economy. Type II reforms require that government\nhave some resources, at least enough to enforce marketfriendly laws and to avoid\nbeing dominated or captured by special interests.\nWhile the full range of differences across countries in Type II reforms are\ndif cult to capture, it is possible to give some sense of the differences across several\nareas: privatization, banking reform, labor and social institutions, and a market\noriented legal system.\nRemarkable differences exist across the transition economies in the strategy of\nprivatizing large and mediumsized rms. Poland and Slovenia moved slowly in\nprivatizing stateowned enterprises, relying instead on \"commercialization,\" where\nrms remained stateowned but were run by somewhat independent appointed\nsupervisory boards rather than directly by the state, and on the creation of new\nprivate rms. Estonia and Hungary proceeded assiduously and surprisingly effec\ntively with privatization of individual stateowned enterprises by selling them one by\none to outside owners. This method of privatization was originally viewed by many\nstrategists as being too slow. Yet it provided muchneeded managerial skills and\nexternal funds for investment in the privatized rms; it generated government\nrevenue and effective corporate governance; and it turned out to be relatively fast\nwhen carried out by determined governments. Russia and Ukraine opted for rapid\nmass privatization and relied primarily on subsidized managementemployee buy\nouts of rms. This method had the advantage of speed, but it has led to poor\ncorporate governance in that existing management usually was not able or willing\nto improve ef ciency. The method also did not generate new investment funds and\nskills, and it provided little revenue for the government. Finally, the Czech Repub\nlic, Lithuania and, to a lesser extent, Slovakia carried out equalaccess voucher\nprivatization, whereby a majority of shares of most rms were distributed to citizens\nat large. While this approach may have been most fair and one of the best in terms\nof speed, it did not generate new investment funds, nor did it bring revenue to the\ngovernment. Instead, it resulted in dispersed ownership of shares and, together\nwith a weak legal framework, it resulted in poor corporate governance. The poor\ncorporate governance often permitted managers or majority shareholders to ap\npropriate pro t or even assets of the rms (to \"tunnel,\" as it is sometimes said) at\nthe expense of minority shareholders.\nIn the development of a banking system, virtually all countries rapidly abol\nished the monobank system as part of Type I reforms. Some countries, such as\nRussia, allowed spontaneous growth of new banks from the bottom up, resulting in\nthe creation of hundreds of banks virtually overnight. In central and eastern\nEurope, the process was much more governmentcontrolled, but even there, doz\nens of small banks rapidly emerged in countries like the Czech Republic and\nPoland. While the banking systems differed in various ways, they shared some\n\nTransition Economies: Performance and Challenges\ndiscouraging patterns. Many of the small banks quickly collapsed. In most coun\ntries, large banks started the transition with a sizable portfolio of nonperforming\nenterprise loans, and upon restructuring, they rapidly accumulated new nonper\nforming loans. The large banks survived primarily because they were \"too large to\nfail\" and governments bailed them out. The need for repeated bailouts of banks has\nin the late 1990s led Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland to privatize virtually\nall domestic banks to large western banks. Central Europe has thus become a\nlaboratory for observing several attempts to introduce a competitive western bank\ning system with virtually no local banks.\nThe transition countries differed in the nature and speed of the development\nof labor and social regulations and institutions. By the end of 1991, all the central\nand eastern European countries developed relatively wellfunctioning unemploy\nment compensation and social security benet schemes, with the originally gener\nous bene ts becoming somewhat more modest over time (Ham, Svejnar and\nTerrell, 1998). In Russia and the other countries of the Commonwealth of Inde\npendent States, the ofcial benets were low to start with and decreased dramati\ncally in real terms over time--and even the low ofcial bene ts were often not paid.\nVirtually no transition country succeeded in rapidly developing a legal system\nand institutions that would be highly conducive to the preservation of private\nproperty and to the functioning of a market economy, although some countries did\nmuch better than others. This lack of a marketoriented legal structure appears to\nhave been the Achilles' heel of the rst dozen years of transition. Many policymak\ners underestimated the importance of a wellfunctioning legal system or believed\ntoo readily that free markets would take care of any major problems. In addition,\nmany newly rich individuals and groups in the transition economies-- especially\nthose who contributed to the corruption of public of cials-- did not desire a strong\nlegal system. The countries that have made the greatest progress in limiting\ncorruption and establishing a functioning legal framework and institutions are the\ncentral European and Baltic countries, with the partial exception of the Czech\nRepublic and Slovakia. In recent years, an important impetus for carrying out legal\nand institutional reforms in many of these countries has been the need to develop\na system that conforms to that of the European Union as a prerequisite for\naccession to the EU.\nPerformance of the Transition Economies Since 1989\nThe transition economies have not performed as well as many had expected.\nEconomic performance has also varied widely across the transition countries, with\nthe central European countries of Poland, Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia and the\nCzech Republic generally performing better than the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia\nand Lithuania and the Balkan states of Bulgaria and Romania, which in turn\nperformed better than Russia, Ukraine and other countries in the Commonwealth\nof Independent States.\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nGross Domestic Product\nCalculating the evolution of GDP is difcult in the transition economies.\nInstead of GDP, the communist countries used \"gross material product\" to measure\nthe size of their economies, a measure that ignored the production of services.\nMoreover, the communist economies were characterized by prices that did not\nre ect scarcity and consumer demand, thus making market valuations dif cult.\nThe dramatic growth in the number of small rms during the transition was not\nwellcaptured in the ofcial statistics--to say nothing of the course of the under\nground economy in these countries both before and during the transition. National\nstatistical of ces and the international institutions have devoted signi cant re\nsources to estimating GDP for the late 1980s and tracing out GDP accurately\nthereafter, but the early data obviously have to be interpreted with caution (Filer\nand Hanousek, 2000, this issue; Brada, King and Kutan, 2000).\nWith the above caveats in mind, one may interpret the growth performance\nsince 1989 as having been mildly to signicantly disappointing in central Europe\nand poor to disastrous in eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates. Figure 1 provides GDP data for an illustrative set of countries. All of the\ntransition economies experienced large declines in output at the start of the\ntransition. The decline varied from 13 to 25 percent in central and eastern Europe;\nover 40 percent in the Baltic countries; and as much as 45 percent or more in Russia\nand even more in many of the other nations of the CIS, like the drop of almost 65\npercent in Ukraine. While the central and eastern European countries reversed the\ndecline after three or four years, in Russia and most of the CIS no turnaround was\nvisible through most of the 1990s. Russia, for instance, suffered a continuous\ndecline in GDP until 1996, showed signs of growth in 1997, but then went into\nanother 5 percent decline during its 1998 nancial crisis.\nAll central European countries except for the Czech Republic have generated\nsustained economic growth since the early to mid1990s. However, only in Poland\nhas the rate of growth been sufcient to start closing the relative income gap with\nthe advanced OECD economies back toward its initial 1989 level. By 2001, every\ntransition economy had an even larger relative income gap with the advanced\neconomies than had existed in 1989.\nWhat is the magnitude of the income gap? At 1999 exchange rates, GDP per\ncapita ranged from $620 in Ukraine to $1,250 in Russia, $4,070 in Poland, $5,200\nin the Czech Republic and $10,000 in Slovenia (EBRD, 2000). Comparable gures\nfor the United States, the 15 European Union countries and Japan were $33,900,\n$22,560 and $32,600, respectively. The gap between the poor and rich countries is\nof course reduced when calculated in terms of purchasing power parity, but\nnonetheless, for most transition economies, the enormous absolute and relative\nincome gaps will take decades to close. Note that since these income gap gures\nrefer to almost one decade after price liberalization, they do not suffer from\nmismeasurement of in ation, as may have been the case in the early transition.\nThe depth and length of the early transition depression was unexpected. A\nnumber of explanations have been offered: tight macroeconomic policies (Bha\n\nJan Svejnar\nFigure 1\nReal GDP Percentage Change Index (1989 5 Base)\nSources: William Davidson Institute, based on OECD Economic Outlook, July 2001; EBRD Transition\nReport 2001 Update; and Davidson Institute staff calculations.\nduri, Kaski and Levcik, 1993; Rosati, 1994); a credit crunch stemming from the\nreduction of state subsidies to rms and rise in real interest rates (Calvo and\nCoricelli, 1992); disorganization among suppliers, producers and consumers asso\nciated with the collapse of central planning (Blanchard and Kremer, 1997; Roland\nand Verdier, 1999); a switch from controlled to uncontrolled monopolistic struc\nture in these economies (Li, 1999; Blanchard, 1997); dif culties of sectoral shifts in\nthe presence of labor market imperfections (Atkeson and Kehoe, 1996); and the\ndissolution in 1990 of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), which\ngoverned trade relations across the Soviet bloc nations. While each explanation\ncontains a grain of truth, none is in itself completely convincing. All countries have\ngone through the decline, yet crosscountry differences in initial conditions and the\nnature of reform are substantial enough to make one question the universal\napplicability of any single explanation. No explanation has strong empirical sup\nport across the board.\nWhat factors account for the persistent growth in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia\nand Slovenia since the early to mid1990s, as compared to the recession experi\nenced in the second half of the 1990s by the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and\nRomania, and the continuous decline in Russia and the other CIS countries? Again,\nno single explanation sufces. Geography alone does not explain the outcomes, as\nthe westernmost country, the Czech Republic, did much worse in the second half\nof the 1990s than countries further east, such as Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. In\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nfact, the evolution of Czech GDP in the second half of the 1990s resembles that of\nBulgaria and Romania.\nThe extent to which countries pursued a combination of key Type II reforms\nprovides some explanatory power. The four leading transition economies shown in\nFigure 1--Poland, Slovenia, Hungary and Slovakia-- have pursued a relatively\ncomplete set of reforms, including maintaining relatively clear property rights and\ncorporate governance. For example, Hungary and, to a lesser extent, Slovakia\nprivatized most stateowned enterprises in a way that assigned clear property rights\nto the new owners. Poland and Slovenia proceeded more slowly with privatization,\nbut both countries exposed the stateowned enterprises to competition and a risk\nof nancial failure. In all four economies, the substantial creation of new private\nrms also contributed to growth.\nOther countries have carried out much more limited Type II reforms. The\nCzech Republic is notable because it was similar to the four leading economies, but\nit grossly neglected the need to establish a functioning legal framework and\ncorporate governance of rms and banks. The privatization experience of the\nCzech Republic, Russia and Ukraine also suggests that mass privatization in the\nabsence of a functioning legal system has strong negative effects on performance.\nThe situation in Russia and other CIS economies has been further aggravated by\nthe political and economic disintegration of the Soviet Union, including attempted\ncoups, a greater presence of organized crime and the spread of aggressive rent\nseeking and corruption.\nIn ation\nA number of the transition economies experienced high in ation or hyperin\nation as the communist system disintegrated. Poland, Slovenia, Albania, Bulgaria\nand Romania all experienced at least one year from 1990 to 1993 when consumer\nprice in ation exceeded 200 percent; Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all had one\nyear with in ation around 1000 percent; and Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan\nexperienced at least one year when in ation was above 2000 percent. Sometimes\nthese bouts of in ation arose after lifting price controls; in other cases, the in a\ntion grew out of nancial sector crises. However, by the later part of the 1990s,\nType I reforms had shown that they could reduce in ation rates with speed and\neffectiveness.\nThe rst column of Table 1 shows rates of in ation for a selected group of\ntransition countries. The rst group of countries are in central Europe, the second\nset represents the northern part of eastern Europe (Baltic countries), the third set\nrepresents the southern part of eastern Europe (Balkan countries), the fourth set\nrepresents Russia and other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates; and the nal panel offers some comparisons from the western European\neconomies and the United States. By 2001, in ation rates in many transition\neconomies were in single digits. Even countries that experienced very high rates of\nin ation during the 1990s--Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Bulgaria, for exam\nple-- had in ation rates in the range of 9 to 35 percent by 2001. This outcome is\n\nTransition Economies: Performance and Challenges\nDebt\nSector\nTable 1\nCurrent Macroeconomic Indicators\nConsumer\nPrice\nInation\n(%)\nCurrent\nAccount\nBalance\n(% of GDP)\nExternal\n(% of GDP)\nGovernment\nBudget\nBalance\n(% of GDP)\nPrivate\nShare\n(% of GDP)\nUnemployment\n(%)\nCentral Europe\nCzech Republic\n4.6\n25.1\n46.5\n29.2\n8.9\nHungary\n9.4\n25.4\n67.8\n23.5\n6.5\nPoland\n6.6\n26.0\n42.8\n23.0\n16.1\nSlovak Republic\n7.1\n23.8\n53.5\n24.0\n18.6\nBaltic Countries\nSlovenia\n7.7\n23.0\n33.4\n21.3\n7.0\nEstonia\n6.2\n27.7\n63.0\n20.5\n13.7\nLatvia\n3.3\n27.1\n66.2\n22.0\n14.3\nLithuania\n2.0\n26.4\n43.8\n21.4\n16.1\nBalkan Countries\nAlbania\n4.0\n26.3\n29.1\n29.2\n17.1\nBulgaria\n8.0\n25.2\n86.0\n21.5\n16.2\nRomania\n35.0\n23.9\n27.8\n24.0\n7.2\nCommonwealth of Independent\nStates\nKazakhstan\n8.7\n2.0\n67.6\n21.5\n6.3\nRussia\n22.4\n10.2\n62.0\n0.0\n10.0\nUkraine\n16.0\n1.4\n33.2\n23.0\n4.2\nComparison Economies\nEuropean Union\n1.8\n20.4\nna\n20.2\nna\n8.2\nUnited States\n2.6\n24.2\nna\n1.5\nna\n4.0\nNotes: Data for 2000 are estimates and 2001 are projections.\nSources: Data in the rst ve columns are from: William Davidson Institute , based on EBRD Transition\nReport, various issues; IMF World Economic Outlook, May 2001; OECD Economic Outlook, July 2001; UN\nTransition at a Glance 2001; World Bank World Development Indicators 2001; and EIUDatastream.

They also signicantly reoriented their foreign trade away from the old\nCouncil for Mutual Economic Assistance arrangements and toward market econo\nmies. However, as domestic in ation exceeded world in ation in the 1990s, the\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nxed exchange rates often became overvalued, leading in some cases to substantial\ncurrent account de cits. For instance, Russia, Albania, Kazakhstan and Bulgaria all\nhad at least one year between 1990 and 1993 when the current account de cit was\n10 percent of GDP or greater. Most countries responded by devaluing their\ncurrencies again and adopting more exible exchange rate regimes, although\nBulgaria, Estonia and Lithuania have xed their exchange rate through currency\nboards as a means of longterm economic stabilization.\nThe second column of Table 1 shows that central and eastern Europe now has\ncurrent account de cits of moderate size, which would be expected for countries\nthat are seeking to attract a net in ow of foreign investment capital. However,\nRussia and the other economies of the Commonwealth of Independent States are\noften signi cant exporters of natural resources and are experiencing a net out ow\nof investment funds, as shown by their current account surpluses.\nExternal Debt and Financial Crises\nA number of transition countries started the 1990s with high foreign indebt\nedness. In Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland, external debt exceeded 50 percent of\nGDP in 1990. In Russia, external debt in 1990 was a whopping 148 percent of GDP.\nOther transition economies, such as Romania, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and\nSlovakia, had conservative regimes where foreign debt was less than 20 percent of\nGDP in 1990.\nThese different initial conditions greatly affected the subsequent performance\nof these countries. For instance, highdebt Poland succeeded in renegotiating its\ndebt, while highdebt Hungary serviced its debt in full. The Hungarian approach\nimposed a heavy scal burden and induced a number of policies, including the\nrevenueoriented form of largescale privatization.\nBy the mid1990s, most of the highly indebted countries reduced their debt\nrelative to GDP, while a number of the less indebted countries raised theirs. But\nsince about 1996, foreign indebtedness appears to have risen in the relatively more\nindebted countries, especially Hungary and Russia. Indeed, Russia defaulted on its\nsovereign debt in 1998. Interestingly, while the Russian nancial crisis had a major\nimpact on the CIS countries that still have close trading relationships with Russia,\nit had relatively little impact on the countries of central and eastern Europe or on\nthe Baltic nations, which had already reoriented most of their trade and commer\ncial relationships to western Europe.\nThe third column of Table 1 shows external debt as a share of GDP in 2000.\nAll the countries in the table have external debt in excess of 25 percent of GDP, but\nleaving aside Bulgaria, none have external debt higher than 70 percent of GDP.\nThis level of external debt is in line with a number of other developing and some\ndeveloped countries. Unless accompanied by other destabilizing factors, such as a\nhigh proportion of shortterm debt that may suddenly not be re nanced as investor\nsentiment shifts (as was the case in Russia), this level of debt is not especially\nalarming.\n\nJan Svejnar\nBudget and Taxes\nSince under communism the government owned almost everything, taxes and\nexpenditures were transfers among centrally determined activities. The principal\ntaxes were a tax on turnover (inputs plus output), along with other taxes on\nenterprises and payroll taxes. Tax rates changed often; indeed, in some countries,\ntax liabilities seemed more a matter of negotiation than a requirement (Tanzi\nand Tsibournes, 2000). Since most taxes were collected at the enterprise level,\nmany citizens were unaware of the heavy tax burden in the communist economies\nand thus have resented the explicit taxes that have been introduced during the\ntransition.\nAs the transition unfolded, governments had to develop new scal institutions\nfor collecting taxes. This institutional development was one of the hardest Type II\nreforms to achieve. While tax collection has been relatively effective in central and\neastern Europe, Russia and some other countries of the Commonwealth of Inde\npendent States have faced signicant declines in tax revenue, as many producers\nhave been operating through barter and accumulating tax arrears. At the same\ntime, the governments have been facing numerous public expenditures, including\ninfrastructure and the new social safety net. The relative inability of Russia and the\nCIS nations to collect taxes is one reason why their social safety nets have been\nmuch weaker than those in central and eastern Europe.\nMany of the transition economies, especially those in central and eastern\nEurope, have higher tax rates than other countries at a similar level of GDP per\ncapita. The highest tax burdens--35 percent to 42 percent of GDP--are found in\ncentral Europe among the most advanced economic reformers, who rely primarily\non the payroll tax, valueadded tax and personal income tax to nance government\nprograms (Tanzi and Tsiboures, 2000). The relatively high ratios of taxes to GDP\nin transition economies have not prevented governments of many of these coun\ntries from running budget decits. Thus, Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\nHungary, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine have in a number of\nyears had annual budget decits in excess of 5 percent of GDP. The fourth column\nof Table 1 shows government budget balance as a share of GDP in 2001.\nThe patterns in public revenues and expenditures re ect local factors as well\nas the mixed advice that the transition economies received from western countries\nand institutions. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have\ngenerally advised the transition economies to aim for balanced government bud\ngets or to run only small budget decits while increasing the size of the private\nsector and reducing the role of the government. The European Union also placed\nemphasis on low budget decits and imposed a 3 percent upper bound on the size\nof the de cit relative to GDP as a precondition for entry into the union. However,\nthe European Union also requires that countries applying for EU membership\nadopt a number of relatively costly social programs and structural measures, which\nplaces upward pressure on government expenditures.\nAn especially problematic aspect of the public nances in many transition\neconomies is the increasing strain from the pension system. The countries of\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\ncentral and eastern Europe entered the transition with publicly funded pension\nsystems, almost universal coverage of the population, low retirement ages (on\naverage 60 for men and 55 for women), a high and growing ratio of retirees to\nworkers, high payroll tax contribution levels and high levels of promised bene ts\nrelative to recently earned preretirement wages (World Bank, 1994; Svejnar, 1997).\nMoreover, most of these systems practice a perverse redistribution of bene ts from\nlowerincome workers to higherincome workers. The promises of these systems,\nwhich are largely payasyougo, are not sustainable. Several countries, including\nHungary, Poland, Latvia and Kazakhstan, have already moved to raise the retire\nment age and to supplement the public retirement system by a multipillar public/\nprivate retirement system with a funded component. Russia and other CIS coun\ntries face less of a public sector burden with regard to retirement costs, because the\nlevel of governmentpromised retirement benets is lower.\nGiven the scal pressure under which most of the transition economies oper\nate, it is interesting to note that their governments have collected very little revenue\nfrom privatization (Tanzi and Tsiboures, 2000). The average in central and eastern\nEurope, as well as in the former Soviet Union, was only about 5 percent of GDP.\nHungary, which was most revenue oriented in its privatization, generated a total of\nabout 14 percent of GDP, which is still a very modest gure when spread over\nseveral years.\nPrivatization and Creation of New Firms\nIn the early 1990s, most transition economies rapidly privatized small enter\nprises as part of their Type I reforms. This smallscale privatization was done mostly\nthrough local auctions. It was instrumental in creating small and mediumsized\nenterprises in countries where most rms were, by ideological and practical design,\neither large or very large. Casual evidence suggests that this shift in ownership\nincreased ef ciency and quality of production.\nParallel developments were the breakups of stateowned enterprises (which\ncontributed to the growth in the number of rms), restructuring of rms and\nmanagement and increased competition. Breakups of small, average and somewhat\naboveaverage size enterprises appear to have increased ef ciency of both the\nremaining master enterprises and the spunoff units (Lizal, Singer and Svejnar,\n2001). Some of the brokenup rms were then privatized.\nA large number of new (mostly small) rms were founded. These rms lled\nniches in demand and started to compete with existing stateowned enterprises and\nwith imports. The growth of new rms has varied across countries. In general, it\nproceeded more quickly and smoothly in central Europe than in eastern Europe\nand the Commonwealth of Independent States. Gomulka (1994) and others at\ntribute much of the success of the Polish economy to the rising production in the\nnew rms.\nFinally, in most countries, the majority of private assets were generated\nthrough largescale privatization, which differed in its method across countries.\nWhat is remarkable, however, is how quickly most countries generated private\n\nTransition Economies: Performance and Challenges\nownership, irrespective of the particular privatization methods used. In 1990, the\nprivate sector had perhaps 20 to 25 percent of GDP in Hungary and Poland, but\ntypically only 5 to 10 percent of GDP in other transition economies. But these\ngures increased very quickly. As early as 1994, the private sector was more than\n30 percent of GDP in all of the transition economies and represented half or more\nof GDP in many countries, including Russia. The fth column of Table 1 shows that\nby 2000 the private sector share of GDP was at or above 60 percent in all of the\ntransition economies except Slovenia and in most of them it constituted 70 to\n80 percent.\nThe effect of privatization on economic performance is surprisingly hard to\ndetermine. At the country level, some of the fastest growing economies (Poland,\nSlovenia and also China) have been among the slowest to privatize. In a\ncrosscountry econometric study, Sachs, Zinnes and Eilat (2000) nd that\nprivatization does not by itself increase GDP growth, but they nd a positive\neffect when privatization is accompanied by indepth institutional reforms. Four\nrecent surveys make a range of assessments: nding no systematically signi cant\neffect of privatization on performance (Bevan, Estrin and Schaffer, 1999);\nconcluding cautiously that privatization improves rm performance (Meggin\nson and Netter, 2001); and being fairly condent that privatization tends to\nimprove performance (Shirley and Walsh, 2000; Djankov and Murrell, 2000).\nClearly, the results are not conclusive. Many of the microeconometric studies\nsuffer from serious problems: small and unrepresentative samples of rms;\nmisreported or mismeasured data; limited controls for other major shocks that\noccurred at the same time as privatization; a short period of observations after\nprivatization; and, above all, not controlling adequately for selectivity bias.\nSelectivity bias is likely to be a particularly serious problem, since better\nperforming rms tend to be privatized rst (Gupta, Ham and Svejnar, 2001).\nThus, comparing the postprivatization performance of privatized rms to the\nperformance of the remaining stateowned rms without controlling for selec\ntivity bias, as many studies do, will erroneously attribute the superior perfor\nmance of the privatized rms to privatization.\nDomestic and Foreign Investment\nThe communist countries, like the east Asian tigers, were known for high rates\nof investment, often exceeding 30 percent of GDP. These investment rates slowed\ndown to about 30 percent in the 1980s in a number of countries as governments\nyielded to public pressure for more consumer goods. The investment rates declined\nfurther to about 20 percent of GDP in the 1990s in a number of transition\neconomies (EBRD, 1996), although countries such as the Czech and Slovak Re\npublics maintained relatively high levels of investment. Unfortunately, much of this\ninvestment appears to have been allocated inefciently-- by the monobank system\nthrough the 1980s and by the inexperienced and often politicized or corrupt\ncommercial banks in the 1990s (Lizal and Svejnar, 2002). Indeed, trends in foreign\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\ndirect investment may provide a better measure of the attractiveness of investment\nin the transition economies than domestic investment gures.\nAs Figure 2 shows, until 1997, Hungary was the only transition economy\nreceiving a signi cant ow of foreign direct investment. Analysts usually attribute\nthis success to the fact that Hungary was more hospitable to and had wellde ned\nrules and regulations for foreign direct investment since the early 1980s. Starting in\n1998, major foreign investments went to the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia.\nHowever, many countries of eastern Europe remain, along with Russia, rather\nunattractive to foreign direct investment. The rate of foreign direct investment\nappears to increase with several factors: the proximity of the perceived date of\naccession of a given country to the European Union; the desirability of the\ncountry's political, economic and legal environment; and the availability of attrac\ntive privatization projects in the country.\nEmployment Adjustment, Wage Setting and Unemployment\nStateowned enterprises in all the transition economies rapidly decreased\nemployment and/or real wages in the early 1990s (Svejnar, 1999). In central\nEurope, the greatest initial reduction in industrial employment occurred in Hun\ngary (over 20 percent), followed by Slovakia (over 13 percent), Poland (over\n10 percent) and the Czech Republic (9 percent). The downward adjustment in\nindustrial wages proceeded in reverse order and amounted to 24 percent in the\nCzech Republic, 21 percent in Slovakia and 1 percent in Poland. Hungarian real\nwages in industry actually rose by 17 percent (Basu, Estrin and Svejnar, 2000). In\nRussia and the rest of CIS, the adjustment brought a mixture of wage and employ\nment adjustment (Desai and Idson, 2000), and the wage decline was more pro\nnounced than in central and eastern Europe (Boeri and Terrell, this issue). As\nBasu, Estrin and Svejnar (1997, 2000) show, labor demand elasticities with respect\nto output and wages were signicant in the more marketoriented pretransition\neconomies, and they rose rapidly in central Europe as transition was launched.\nDepending on the institutional setting in a given country, the sharp decline in\noutput at the start of the transition was hence absorbed more by employment or\nwage decreases.\nFigure 3 shows that in most transition economies, the employment decline\nreached 15 percent to 30 percent in the 1990s. A continuous decline is observed in\nRussia, Slovakia and Romania; an Lshaped pattern detected in Bulgaria, Hungary\nand Slovenia; a Ushaped pattern in Poland; and a sideways Sshaped pattern in the\nCzech Republic. When combined with the GDP data in Figure 1, the employment\ndata suggest that restructuring in the transition economies involved an initial\ndecline in labor productivity as output fell faster than employment and a subse\nquent rise in productivity as output and labor stopped declining. But a note of\ncaution is in order here. With production shifting from large to small rms, the\ndecline in employment (and output) may be less pronounced than suggested by\nthe of cial data, since small rms are harder to capture in of cial statistics.\nUnemployment was unknown before the transition, but it emerged rapidly in\n\nJan Svejnar\nFigure 2\nForeign Direct Investment Per Capita\n(net inows in U.S. dollars recorded in the balance of payments, per capita)\nSources: William Davidson Institute, based on EBRD Transition Report 2001 Update, World Bank\nDevelopment Indicators 2001 and Davidson Institute staff calculations.\ncentral and eastern European countries, except for the Czech Republic. Within two\nyears after the start of the transition, the unemployment rate rose into double digits\nin most economies of central and eastern Europe. By 1993, for example, the\nunemployment rate reached 16 percent in Bulgaria and Poland, 12 percent in\nHungary and Slovakia, 10 percent in Romania, 9 percent in Slovenia, but only\n3.5 percent in the Czech Republic. The high unemployment rates re ected high\nrates of in ow into unemployment as rms laid off workers and relatively low\nout ow rates from unemployment as the unemployed found it hard to nd new\njobs. The Czech labor market was an ideal model of a transition labor market,\ncharacterized by high in ows as well as out ows, with unemployment representing\na transitory state between old and new jobs (Ham, Svejnar and Terrell, 1998, 1999;\nSvejnar, 1999; Boeri, 2000). Unemployment rose more slowly in the Common\nwealth of Independent States and the Baltic countries, as rms were slower to lay\noff workers and used wage declines and arrears as devices to hold on to workers. In\n1993, for example, unemployment in Russia and Estonia still hovered near\n6 percent.\nOver time, the patterns of unemployment have shown considerable differen\ntiation. The Czech Republic was the only central European country to enter\nrecession in the second half of the 1990s, and its unemployment rate correspond\ningly rose to 8 percent. The fastgrowing economies of Poland, Hungary, Slovenia\nand, to a lesser extent, Slovakia managed to reduce their unemployment rates in\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nFigure 3\nEmployment Index\n(1989 5 base)\nSource: William Davidson Institute , based on U.N. Economic Commission for Europe, Statistical\nDivision.\nthe late 1990s. Conversely, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the\nBaltic countries experienced gradual increases in unemployment as their transition\nproceeded. By 1997, unemployment rates in Russia and Estonia were near\n10 percent. By 1999-2000, the unemployment rate rose again in Bulgaria, the\nCzech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. It stabilized in countries such as\nHungary, Romania and Russia. As may be seen in column 6 of Table 1, with the\nexception of Hungary, Slovenia and Romania, transition economies in 2000 had\nrelatively high unemployment rates that are at least as high as, and often signi\ncantly exceed, those observed in the European Union.\nWhile real wages in central and eastern Europe have increased by about\n15 percent to 20 percent after their initial 25 percent decline in the 1989-1991\nperiod, in Russia and a number of other CIS countries real wages declined until\n1993 and stagnated or increased only moderately thereafter (Svejnar, 1999; EBRD,\n2000). The trajectory of real incomes has thus been very different in the more and\nlessadvanced transition economies.\nThe reduction in employment in the old stateowned rms along with the rise\nin unemployment and establishment of new rms have brought about considerable\ndestruction and creation of jobs, as well as mobility of labor. Contrary to the main\n\nTransition Economies: Performance and Challenges\nmodels of the transition process, Jurajda and Terrell (2001) show that job creation\nin new rms is not necessarily tightly linked to job destruction in the old rms,\nsince many new jobs have been created even in economies (such as the Czech\nRepublic) that experienced low rates of job destruction. Sabirianova (2000) pro\nvides a related structural insight that much of the labor mobility consisted of\noccupational rather than geographic change, with individuals moving from one\noccupation to another within regions, as jobs in old occupations were destroyed\nand opportunities in new occupations were created. Compared to the U.S. labor\nmarket, where individuals move more geographically than occupationally, the\ntransition has led to more occupational rather than geographic mobility.\nData on income distribution, expressed in the form of Gini coef cients, are\nsummarized in Table 2.3 The communist countries had highly egalitarian income\ndistributions. In central and eastern Europe, the Gini coef cients ranged from 20\nin Czechoslovakia and Slovenia to 25 in Poland in the late 1980s. The 1988\nUkrainian Gini coefcient of 23 (based on survey data) and the 1991 Russian\ncoef cient of 26 based on the registry wage data of the Russian Statistical Of ce\n(Goskomstat) suggest that income distribution was relatively egalitarian in the\nformer Soviet Union as well. However, inequality increased during the 1990s, with\nthe Gini coef cient reaching 26-34 in central and eastern Europe, 30 in Ukraine\nand 40 in Russia. These coefcients bring inequality in the transition economies\ninto the range spanned by capitalist economies from the relatively egalitarian\nSweden to the relatively inegalitarian United States and in line with developing\ncountries such as India. However, while the central and eastern European data\nseem to re ect reality, the Russian and Ukrainian data may well understate the\nextent of inequality. In particular, the Goskomstat data are based on wages that\nrms are supposed to be paying to workers, but many Russian rms have not been\npaying contractual wages (Desai and Idson, 2000). In Table 2, a second row for\nRussia and Ukraine shows inequality based on survey data from the Russian\nLongitudinal Monitoring Survey of households. These data suggest that income\ninequality in Russia and Ukraine has reached much higher levels--a Gini coef\ncient of 47-50 --which resembles the level of inequality found in developing\neconomies with the most inegalitarian distribution of income, like Brazil.\nThe relatively egalitarian structure of income distribution in central and\neastern European countries has been brought about by their social safety nets,\nwhich rolled back inequality that would have been brought about by market forces\nalone (Garner and Terrell, 1998). Conversely, the Russian social safety net has been\nregressive--it has made the distribution of income more unequal than it would\nhave been without it (Commander, Tolstopiatenko and Yemtsov, 1999).\n3 The Gini coefcient varies from 0 to 100, with 0 representing a perfectly egalitarian distribution of\nincome (every individual or household receiving the same income) and 100 denoting the most\ninegalitarian distribution (one person or household receiving all income).\n\n23.0\n26.0\n24.4\n26.0\n25.3\n25.0\n29.8\n32.7\n21.5\n26.3\n19.8\n24.1\n26.1\n35.0\n37.0\n31.0\n32.0\n33.0\n34.0\n21.7\n33.3\n34.1\n23.3\n28.6\n30.5\na\n26.0\n39.8\n39.9\nb\n54.3\n45.5\n51.8\na\n--\nna\n33.4\n30.0\nb\n23.3\n47.0\n--\nna\nTable 2\nIncome Inequality: Gini Coef cients\nLate 1980s\nEarly 1990s\nLate 1990s\nYear\nGini\nYear\nGini\nYear\nGini\nCentral Europe\nCzech Republic\n20.0\nHungary\nPoland\nSlovak Republic\n19.5\nSlovenia\nBaltic Countries\nEstonia\n1987-90\n24.0\n1993-94\n1996-99\nLatvia\n1987-90\n24.0\n1996-99\nLithuania\n1987-90\n23.0\n1993-94\n1996-99\nBalkan Countries\nBulgaria\nRomania\nCommonwealth of Independent States\nRussia\nRussia\nUkraine\nUkraine\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nNotes: abased on Goskomstat data; bbased on survey data.\nSources: William Davidson Institute based on various sources and Davidson Institute staff calculations.

The data on life expectancy\npresented in Table 3 display this pattern. For comparison, between 1989 and 1999,\nlife expectancy at birth increased by about two years from 75 to 76.9 years in the\nUnited States and from 76.5 to 78.5 years in France. During the same period, life\nexpectancy increased by one to three years in most central European countries;\nincreased slightly in the Baltic countries; declined slightly in Albania, Bulgaria and\nRomania; and declined by 3.5 years in Russia, over three years in Ukraine and\nalmost four years in Kazakhstan. The decline in life expectancy in Russia, Ukraine\nand Kazakhstan during the transition hence represents a major break from increas\ning life expectancies in the past. Disaggregated data indicate that the decline in life\nexpectancy in the CIS countries is largely due to the early deaths of middleaged\nmales, who are presumably more exposed to stress and resort to heavy alcohol\nconsumption.\n\n74.6\n2.07\n70.6\n1.91\n73.2\n2.28\n72.7\n2.31\n75.1\n2.08\n70.6\n2.02\n69.8\n2.00\n72.1\n1.97\n72.1\n3.62\n71.1\n2.05\n69.5\n2.43\n64.8\n2.90\n65.8\n1.88\n67.3\n1.99\n78.5\n1.95\n--\n77.0\n1.44\n--\n1.89\n1.84\nTable 3\nLife Expectancy and Fertility\nLife Expectancy at Birth\n(total years)\nFertility rate\n(total births per woman)\nCentral Europe\nCzech Republic\n70.3\n71.7\n1.87\n1.17\nHungary\n69.5\n69.5\n1.78\n1.32\nPoland\n70.1\n71.0\n2.08\n1.40\nSlovak Republic\n70.4\n71.0\n2.08\n1.37\nSlovenia\n70.3\n72.7\n1.52\n1.24\nBaltic Countries\nEstonia\n69.1\n70.1\n2.21\n1.23\nLatvia\n69.1\n70.1\n2.05\n1.11\nLithuania\n70.7\n71.5\n1.98\n1.35\nBalkan Countries\nAlbania\n69.3\n72.5\n3.00\n2.40\nBulgaria\n71.4\n71.8\n1.90\n1.13\nRomania\n69.1\n69.5\n2.20\n1.32\nCommonwealth of Independent States\nKazakhstan\n66.6\n68.3\n2.82\n2.00\nRussia\n67.1\n69.3\n2.01\n1.25\nUkraine\n69.2\n70.5\n1.99\n1.30\nComparison Countries\nFrance\n74.3\n76.5\n1.79\n1.77\nGermany\n72.6\n1.42\n1.35\nUnited Kingdom\n73.8\n77.2\n1.80\n1.71\nUnited States\n73.66\n75.02\n76.91\n2.01\n2.06\nJan Svejnar\nSources: William Davidson Institute, based on the World Bank World Development Indicators 2001, and the\nGlobal Market Information Database.\nFertility\nFertility data in Table 3 indicate that the number of births per woman declined\ndramatically in virtually all the transition economies in the 1990s, as compared to\nthe counterpart numbers in western countries and to the trend in the 1980s. As of\n1989, the transition and western countries had similar ranges of fertility rates, from\n1.5 in Slovenia to 2.2 in Romania among the transition countries, and from 1.4 in\nGermany to 2.0 in the United States. In the 1990s, fertility rates declined modestly\nin western Europe and rose slightly in the United States. In contrast, in Russia and\nUkraine, the fertility rates plummeted from about 2 to 1.3. The rate of decline is\nsubstantial in all the other transition economies.\nMarriage and Divorce Rates\nAs may be seen from Table 4, marriage rates have been declining over time\nin most western as well as transition economies.

But the rate of decline in marriage rates accelerated\nin most transition economies. In 1989, marriage rates in the Soviet republics and\nthe Czech part of Czechoslovakia were in a range of 8 percent to 10 percent. By\n2000, these transition economies recorded marriage rates of 3.3 percent to 6\npercent.\nConversely, the data in Table 4 indicate that the propensity to divorce does\nnot seem to have been much affected by the transition. Indeed, while divorce\nrates rose in western European countries in the 1990s, they declined in many\ntransition economies, including Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Russia\nand Ukraine.\nHence, while one might expect that the psychological stress and economic\nhardship of the transition would result in increased breakups of families, on the\nwhole this has not been the case. The transition appears to have had a strong\nnegative effect on marriage formation and fertility, but it has not destroyed existing\nmarriages.\n\nTransition Economies: Performance and Challenges\nAttitudes\nPeople's attitudes toward the transition provide interesting information that\ncomplements the evidence on behavior. Table 5 presents several ndings from a\n1999 study carried out by the Public Opinion Research Center (1999) on national\nrandom samples of 1,018 individuals in the Czech Republic, 1,523 individuals in\nHungary and 1,111 individuals in Poland. These three countries are the most\nadvanced transition economies. They have succeeded in joining OECD and NATO,\nand they are among the ve frontrunners for admission to the European Union.\nHowever, the ndings re ect quite negative attitudes toward the bene ts of the\ntransition during the 1989-1999 decade.\nIn all three countries, the majority of individuals feel that it was worthwhile to\nchange the political and economic system, with the largest majority (67 percent)\nbeing found in Poland, where the political revolts in the 1980s were the strongest\nand the GDP growth in the 1990s the fastest. However, in each country many more\npeople believe that the losses from transition exceeded the gains rather than the\nreverse. Similarly, in each country, more respondents feel that their \"material\nconditions of living are now a little worse\" rather than the reverse. The attitud\ninal survey hence provides a sobering assessment of how people in the most\nadvanced transition economies feel about the bene ts and costs of the transition.\nIt is likely that the sentiment in the more poorly performing countries is even more\npessimistic.\nAssessment\nThe performance of the former Soviet bloc economies during the rst twelve\nyears of the transition has been disappointing. While many important structural\ntransformations have taken place, the relative gap in per capita income between\nthese countries and the advanced economies has widened. A major problem for the\ntransition economies was clearly the initial recession that set them back relative to\nthe advanced economies. In Russia, Ukraine and other CIS countries, this depres\nsion lasted almost a decade. Transition countries further east have on average\nperformed worse than their more western counterparts, which suggests that\ngeographyrelated initial conditions have been important in the transition process.\nThe central European countries, located most to the west among the transition\neconomies, have historically shared the same alphabet and religions, had similar\neducational and bureaucratic systems, and intensively traded and otherwise inter\nacted with countries in western Europe. They, together with the Balkan countries,\nwere under the Soviet system for only four decades, as compared to ve decades in\nthe case of the Baltic countries and seven decades in the countries of the Com\nmonwealth of Independent States. Finally, the countries of central Europe were the\nrst to aspire and be encouraged to prepare for entry to the European Union. The\nphysical proximity and sense of historical belonging to Europe hence seems to have\nprovided an important advantage for the \"western\" transition economies in moving\nfrom the Sovietstyle system to a democratic and marketoriented system. However,\n\nTable 5\nAttitudes Toward Transition\nQuestion\nCountry\nResponses\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nFrom a temporal perspective, do\nyou think that it was\nworthwhile to change the\npolitical and economic\nsystem?\nHave the changes taking place in\nyour country since 1989\nbrought people more losses\nthan gains?\nPlease compare your present\nsituation with the situation\nbefore 1989 and say whether:\nThe opportunities of having an\nimpact on the political life in\nthe country are now:\nMaterial conditions of living\nare now:\nYour life is now generally:\nDifcult\nYes\nNo\nto say\nCzech Republic\n55%\n32%\n13%\nHungary\n46%\n40%\n13%\nPoland\n67%\n24%\n12%\nMore gains\nThe\nMore losses\nDifcult\nthan losses\nsame\nthan gains\nto say\nCzech Republic\n23%\n42%\n31%\n4%\nHungary\n15%\n28%\n45%\n12%\nPoland\n24%\n30%\n37%\n8%\nNeither\nbetter\nA little\nnor\nA little\nDifcult\nbetter\nworse\nworse\nto say\nCzech Republic\n20%\n37%\n20%\n23%\nHungary\n41%\n29%\n14%\n16%\nPoland\n30%\n44%\n14%\n12%\nCzech Republic\n30%\n29%\n33%\n8%\nHungary\n12%\n16%\n66%\n6%\nPoland\n25%\n19%\n46%\n10%\nCzech Republic\n35%\n30%\n29%\n6%\nHungary\n18%\n27%\n49%\n6%\nPoland\n28%\n23%\n40%\n9%\nSource: Public Opinion Research Center (1999).\nthe fact that the westernmost transition economy, the Czech Republic, has per\nformed worse than others since the mid1990s indicates that geography does not\nprovide a complete explanation and that policies do matter.4\n4 An interesting counterfactual approach to assessing the validity of initial conditions versus policies as\nexplanations is to ask how an aggressive effort by western countries would have affected the transition.\nFor example, consider East Germany, which received enormous capital inows from West Germany\n($80-100 billion annually) to build modern infrastruc ture and also received a modern legal and\ninstitutional infrastru cture by absorption into a united Germany. However, West Germany also feared a\nood of businesses to lowwage East Germany and a ood of East Germans coming west for higher wages\nand welfare benets. It thus passed a set of rules that raised labor cost per worker in eastern Germany\nfrom about 10 percent of the western German level to about 80 percent. This dramatic jump in labor\ncost, combined with relatively low labor productivity, made rms in eastern Germany retrench and\nforced many of them out of existence. Since the early 1990s, open and disguised unemployment in\neastern Germany has been at about twice the level of unemployment in the central European transition\neconomies. Any substantial western plan to assist transitio n countries would have offered lower subsidies\nand created less legal and institutio nal reform than occurred in East Germany, although the effects of\nsuch nancial subsidies, institutio nal reforms and market access could nonetheless have been substan\ntial. But such a plan might also have involved restrictions on labor leaving the transitio n economies or\n\nJan Svejnar\nInterestingly, the initial conditions had little impact on whether the countries\ncarried out Type I reforms--macroeconomic stabilization, price liberalization,\nreduction of direct subsidies, breakup of trusts, stateowned enterprises and the\nmonobank system, removal of barriers to the creation of new rms, carrying out\nsmallscale privatization and introduction of a social safety net--which all transition\neconomies carried out quickly. However, initial conditions did affect Type II\nreforms: largescale privatization, further (indepth) development of a commercial\nbanking sector and effective tax system, labor market regulations and institutions\nrelated to the social safety net, and establishment and enforcement of a market\noriented legal system and accompanying institutions. The reform of greatest im\nportance seems to be that countries that placed emphasis on the development of a\nfunctioning legal framework and corporate governance of rms, like Hungary,\nPoland and Slovenia, have performed better than those that did not, like the Czech\nRepublic, Russia and Ukraine. On a related note, evidence suggests that largescale\nprivatization can be handled in a variety of ways, or even delayed, as long as the\nstateowned rms face the discipline of needing to earn their way without govern\nment bailouts and as long as new rms appear through new creation, breakups of\nold rms and foreign investment.\nWhen Will the Transition be Over?\nSince transition is a process, it is natural to ask when it is likely to be completed.\nThe answer depends on how one denes the terminal point. A number of analysts\nare on record on this issue and their denitions differ considerably.\nJanos Kornai (1999) views the end of transition as a situation in which the\ncommunist parties have lost monopoly political power, the private sector accounts\nfor the majority of GDP and the market is the dominant coordinator of economic\nactivities. According to this sensible denition, rooted in a radical shift in political\npower and a fundamental structural change in the economy, the transition is in\nmost countries over--and has been so for the last ve years.\nFrom a different angle, Alan Gelb (1999) sees the end of transition as a state\nwhen the problems and the policy issues confronted by today's \"transition coun\ntries\" resemble those faced by other countries at similar levels of development. This\nde nition relies on notions of economic development and also makes good sense.\nBased on this denition, one may also argue that the transition is over. The fact that\nprivate sector analysts such as Morgan Stanley and publications such as The Econo\nmist increasingly place advanced transition countries into the general category of\n\"emerging market economies\" also supports this point of view.\nBut whatever the logic of these arguments, most citizens of the transition\ndemands that expensive social programs be enacted. Likely results would have been a faster rise in living\nstandards for the employed, higher unemployment rates and more unequal income distributions in\ntransition economies. The overall effect on economic growth and other performance indicators would\nhave depended on which effects dominated.\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\ncountries do not feel that they have accomplished the transition. I believe that this\nis because most have been implicitly equating the transition with a process that will\nmake them partners with the relatively advanced countries in the world in general\nand with western Europe in particular. Taking this aspect into account, I would\nde ne the end of transition as a state when these economies replace central\nplanning by a functioning market system and when they generate rapid and\nsustainable rates of economic growth that enable them to interact with the more\nadvanced market economies without major forms of protection. Estonia, Poland,\nthe Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and possibly Slovakia will presumably reach\nthis stage in a few years when they fully enter the European Union. Others have a\nmuch longer way to go.\ny First drafts of all the papers in this symposium were originally presented at a Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives conference at CERGEEI, Prague, Czech Republic, on March 24,\n2001, with funding from the Andrew W.

Introduction\nSeveral related strands of literature on law, institutions, finance, and economic growth\nhave emerged in financial economics in recent years, and their impact on other areas of research\nhas been significant. First, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, Vishny (LLSV hereafter) and\nothers have produced a substantial body of empirical evidence that links the origin of a country's\nlegal system to the country's institutions and financial and economic \"outcomes.\" One of the\ncentral results of this literature is that, countries with English common-law origin (French civil\nlaw origin) provide the strongest (weakest) legal protections to both shareholders and creditors\n(LLSV 1998, 2000a). Countries with English origin also seem to have better institutions, including\nless corrupt governments (LLSV 1999), more efficient courts (Djankov et al., DLLS hereafter,\n2003a), and more informative accounting standards (LLSV 1998). Better legal protections and\nbetter institutions, in turn, seem to lead to better outcomes for the financial system, both at the\naggregate and firm levels.1 Related to the LLSV results, there is a recent literature attempting to\nunderstand why and how a country's legal origin affects the country's institutions, and how legal\norigin and institutions, both jointly and separately, affect economic and financial outcomes.2\nThe second literature champions the view that the development of the financial system that\nincludes a stock market and intermediation, contributes to a country's overall economic growth\n(e.g., McKinnon 1973). Recently, researchers have strengthened this view by presenting\nsupporting empirical evidence at the country-level (e.g., King and Levine 1993, Levine and\nZervos 1998), as well as at the industry- and firm-levels (e.g., Rajan and Zingales 1998, Jayaratne\n1 For example, relative to firms in French-origin countries, firms in English-origin countries have more dispersed\nshareholder ownership (LLS 1999), rely more on external capital markets to raise funds (LLSV 1997), have higher\nvalues (LLSV 2002), and can enter a new market or industry more easily (DLLS 2002).\n2 Endeavors by researchers include examining the difference between contracting institutions and property rights\ninstitutions (e.g., Acemoglu and Johnson 2003), the endowment of geography and disease environment in former\ncolonial countries (e.g., Acemoglu et al. 2001, 2002, Beck et al. 2003a), the legal system's ability to adapt to evolving\n\nand Strahan 1996). The third literature provides evidence for the link and causality between law,\nfinance, and economic growth. For example, Levine (1999) finds that the legal environment\ncontributes to the growth of financial intermediation, which in turn stimulates the overall\neconomic growth of a country.3\nHowever, many of the above studies are at country level, and they treat each country in\ntheir sample on an equal-weight basis. For example, among the countries in the LLSV (1998)\nsample, large diverse countries such as Brazil and India receive the same weight as small\nhomogeneous countries like Jordan and Ecuador. We might expect that small homogeneous\ncountries could have more effective legal systems because they can be closely tailored to the\ncountries' needs. Moreover, most of the studies exclude one of the most important developing\ncountries in the world, China.4 In this paper, we demonstrate that China is a significant\ncounterexample to the findings of the existing literature on law, institutions, finance, and growth.\nDespite its poor legal and financial systems, China has one of the fastest growing economies in the\nworld. 5 Using Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) formulas, it already has the second largest\neconomy, and will overtake the U.S. and become the largest in the world in ten years. We examine\nthree sectors of the Chinese economy: 1) the State Sector includes all companies where the\ngovernment has ultimate control (state-owned enterprises, or SOEs); 2) the Listed Sector includes\nall firms that are listed on an exchange and are publicly traded; and 3) the Private Sector that\nincludes all the other firms with various types of private and local government ownership.6 We\neconomic conditions (e.g., Hayek 1960, Posner 1973, Beck et al. 2003b), and religion and cultural beliefs (e.g., Greif\n1994, Stulz and Williamson 2003).\n3 In addition, Beck and Levine (2002) find evidence for manufacturing industries across 42 countries, while\nDemirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1998) find evidence at firm level.\n4 Some of the papers (e.g., DLLS 2002, 2003a, 2003b), do examine certain aspects of the Chinese economy or its legal\nsystem, but none of them provides a comprehensive study on China, nor a study on China's Private Sector.\n5 In 2003, despite the impact of the SARS epidemic, the expected growth rate of China's GDP is over 9%, the highest\namong the largest economies in world. See Wall Street Journal (01/21/2004) and Asian Development Bank for details.\n6 The Private Sector includes the following types of firms: 1) \"quasi-state-owned\" companies, namely, collectively-\nand jointly-owned companies, where joint ownership between the government and local communities or institutions is\n\nfind that the law-finance-growth nexus established by existing literature works well for the State\nand Listed Sectors in China: with poor legal protections of minority and outside investors,\n(standard) external markets are weak, and growth of these firms is slow or negative. However, the\nsize, growth, and importance of these two sectors in the economy are dominated by those of the\nPrivate Sector. With poorer applicable legal protections and standard financing channels, the\nPrivate Sector has been growing much faster and contributing to most of the economy's growth.\nOur conclusion for the imbalance among the three sectors is that there exist very effective,\nalternative financing channels and corporate governance mechanisms to support the growth of the\nPrivate Sector. Our evidence suggests that these alternative channels and mechanisms are in part\nbased on reputation and relationships, and they can substitute for and do at least as well as\nstandard channels and mechanisms.\nUsing measures from the existing literature, we first find that China's law and institutions,\nincluding investor protection systems, corporate governance, accounting standards, and quality of\ngovernment, are significantly less developed than those in most of the countries in the LLSV\n(1997, 1998) and Levine (2002) samples. We also find China's financial system is dominated by a\nlarge but under-developed banking system that is mainly controlled by the four state-owned banks.\nIts newly established Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE hereafter) and ShenZhen Stock Exchange\n(SZSE hereafter) have been growing very fast since their inception in 1990, but their scale and\nimportance are still not comparable to other channels of financing, in particular the banking sector,\nfor the entire economy. Developing the banking system, in particular alleviating the burden of\nnon-performing loans (NPLs) of state-owned banks on the banking system and the whole\neconomy, is as important as further developing the stock market.\nforged; 2) privately owned companies (excluding publicly traded companies that were privately owned): controlling\nowners of these firms can be Chinese citizens, investors (or companies) from Taiwan or Hong Kong, or foreign\ninvestors (or companies). See Appendix A.4 for more details.\n\nWe next examine separately financing channels, corporate governance, and the growth of\nfirms in each of the three sectors. The State Sector has been shrinking with the ongoing\nprivatization process, which include firms going public. Our empirical results on the Listed Sector\nare based on a sample of more than 1100 firms listed and traded on SHSE and SZSE. First, we\nfind that the equity ownership is concentrated among the State for firms converted from the State\nSector, and founders' families for non-state firms.7 Second, the standard corporate governance\nmechanisms are weak and ineffective in the Listed Sector. Finally, when we examine listed firms'\ndividend policy and valuations and compare them to those in the LLSV (2000b, 2002) sample\nfirms, we find both the dividend ratio and firm value of Chinese firms are low compared to similar\nfirms operating in countries with stronger investor protections, consistent with LLSV predictions.\nMore interesting results are found for the Private Sector. Our evidence is mainly based on\nsurveying 17 entrepreneurs and executives in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces, two of the most\ndeveloped regions in China. First, the two most important financing channels for these firms\nduring their start-up and subsequent periods are financial intermediaries, including state-owned\nbanks and private credit agencies, and founders' friends and families. Firms have outstanding\nloans from multiple financial intermediaries, with most of the loans secured by fixed assets or\nthird party guarantees. During a firm's growth period, funds from \"ethnic Chinese\" investors\n(from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other countries) as well as other foreign investors are also\nimportant sources. Many firms purchase the \"operation rights\" of land from the government, with\na typical contract that lasts for 20-50 years. When asked about the prospect of going public,\nfounders and executives list \"access to large scale of funding\" and \"reputation increase\" as the\n7 Our result on family ownership is similar to the findings of Claessens, Djankov and Lang (2000) and Claessens et al.\n(2002) on listed firms in Asia, while different from the findings of LLS (1999).\n\nmost important benefits, and \"disclosure of valuable information to competitors and outsiders\" and\n\"large amount of fees paid\" as the most critical disadvantages of going public.\nSecondly, despite the almost non-existence of formal governance mechanisms, alternative\nmechanisms have been remarkably effective in the Private Sector. Perhaps the most important of\nthese is the role of reputation and relationships (Greif 1989, 1993). Another important mechanism\nthat drives good management and corporate governance is competition. Given the environment of\nlow survivorship during early stages of firms' development, gaining comparative advantage in the\nregion and the industry provides a strong incentive for all firms. Family-run firms also provide\neffective governance (Burkart et al. 2003), as the founders of many successful Private Sector firms\nusually have a very high ownership stake. Finally, in anticipating the possible loss of their\ninvestment due to the failure of the firm, poor formal investor protections, political risks, and\ncorrupt government officials, why are investors, in particular investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong\nand other countries, willing to finance and refinance these firms? An important reason is the\ncommon goal of sharing high prospective profits can tie local and foreign investors with\nentrepreneurs and managers to overcome numerous obstacles and achieve just that. Under this\ncommon goal in a multi-period setting, implicit contractual agreements and reputation can act as\nenforcement mechanisms to ensure that all parties fulfill their roles to make the firm successful.\nProfit sharing also makes it incentive compatible for officials at various levels to support the\ngrowth of the firm.\nOur results on the difference between the three sectors in China challenge the law and\nfinance view that it is the legal origin that causes the difference in financial systems, the finance\nand growth view that it is the development of stock markets and banking system that causes the\ndifference in growth of firms and economies, as well as the view supporting the law-finance-\ngrowth nexus. Moreover, the success of the Private Sector in China also challenges the view that\n\nproperty rights and government corruption are crucial institutions determining financial and\neconomic outcomes. Although our results are based on China, similar \"substitutes\" based on\nreputation and relationships may be behind the success of other economies as well, including\ndeveloped economies. Thus a thorough examination of these substitutes has much more general\nimplications and can provide valuable guidance for many other countries. Finally, some of our\nresults are consistent with existing research on economies in transition (from Socialist, central\nplanning systems to market-based economies), including Eastern European countries, Russia,\nVietnam, and China.8 Unlike existing research, our paper provides both aggregate and firm-level\nevidence on the finance aspects of the Chinese economy, and examines why China differs from\nother countries studied in the strands of literature on law, institutions, finance, and economic\ngrowth.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II compares China's legal and\nfinancial systems to other countries, as well as the growth in the State, Listed, and Private Sectors.\nSection III presents evidence on firms' financing channels in China and other countries. Section\nIV examines the Listed Sector, including corporate governance, firms' financing channels, payout\npolicy, and valuations. In Section V we first provide survey and anecdotal evidence on Private\nSector firms, and then discuss the alternative financing channels and governance mechanisms.\nFinally we conclude in Section VI. Appendix A contains explanations of all the variables that we\nuse in the paper, and Appendix B provides details of our empirical tests on the Listed Sector.\nII. Evidence on China's Legal and Financial Systems, and Growth in the Three Sectors\n8 See McMillian (1997), McMillan and Woodruff (2002) for reviews of this literature. We discuss the difference\nbetween China's transition toward a market-based economy to that of other countries in Section V.\n\nIn this section we first provide evidence on China's entire economy, and then on the status\nof its legal and financial systems. We next compare China to the countries studied by the existing\nliterature (the LLSV sample and the Levine sample). Finally we compare growth in the State,\nListed, and Private Sectors of China.\nII.1 Status of China's Economy\nTables 1-A and 1-B illustrate China's status as one of the most important countries in the\nworld. At the end of 2002 it had a population of 1.28 billion people, the largest of any country.\nFrom the column on the left in Table 1-A, China's GDP ranked 6th in the world using simple\nexchange rate calculations.9 However, if we use PPP formula to recalculate the GDPs, China's\neconomy is the second largest behind only the US, as shown in the middle column of Table 1-A.\nMoreover, with the same PPP formula and assuming that the US economy continues to grow at\n4.69% per year, it will take only 10 years before China overtakes the US to be the largest economy\nin the world.10\nInsert Tables 1-A and 1-B here.\nIt may be more useful to compare China's economic growth with other major emerging\neconomies rather than the most developed countries, since China's rapid growth only started in\n1979 when it opened its door to the outside world.11 In Table 1-B we compare China with the\nseven largest emerging economies in the world. In terms of PPP-adjusted GDP figures in 2002,\nChina is almost twice the size of Mexico, the second largest emerging economy. While in terms of\n9 Except otherwise noted, we use the exchange rate of 1 US$ = 8.28 RMB in all of our currency-related calculations\nthroughout the paper.\n10 All of China's GNP and GNP growth figures exclude Hong Kong. The PPP conversion factor we used is obtained\nfrom the World Bank Development Indicator. For details refer to the \"Handbook of the International Program,\"\nUnited Nation, New York 1992. The growth rate of the US is calculated using the period 1990-2002.\nMeasured by simple exchange rates, China's GDP in 1980 was US$180.6 billion while in 1990 it reached US$368\nbillion. Also note that the exchange rate between RMB and US$ changed from US$1 = 4.25 yuan to 8.28 yuan in\n1992, which introduced a significant downward bias for China's GDP figure in 1992. See\nhttp://www.safe.gov.cn/0430/js_tzyg.htm (in Chinese) for more details. This is why using PPP adjusted figures to\nmeasure GDP and its growth is more appropriate.\n\nthe annual growth rate of PPP-adjusted GDPs during 1990-2002, China has been growing much\nfaster than India, which has the second highest growth rate during the same period. With the recent\nentrance into the WTO and large potential markets it can provide, China will play an increasingly\nsignificant role in the world economy.\nII.2 Legal System\nWe first examine similar measures on the legal system of China and compare them to the\naverage measures of the 49 countries studied in LLSV (1998). See Appendix A.1 for a list of the\ndefinitions of the measures used in the paper. From Table 2-A, we can see that in terms of overall\ncreditor rights, China falls in between the English-origin countries that have the highest measures\nof protection, and French-origin countries that have the poorest protection. Table 2-B shows that\nChina's shareholder protection shows a similar pattern. Because the distribution of these measures\nmay be heavily skewed toward the tails due to a few \"outlier\" countries with very high and low\nscores, we also provide the percentage of countries in the sub-samples and the entire sample of\nLLSV countries that have equal or higher measures than China's (numbers in brackets in Tables\n2-A and 2-B). Almost half of countries in the French-origin sub-sample, to which China compares\nfavorably, have equal or better measures of creditor and shareholder rights. The overall evidence\nthus suggests that the majority of LLSV sample countries have better creditor and shareholder\nprotections than China.\nInsert Tables 2-A and 2-B here.\nWe obviously cannot draw our conclusions regarding the comparison of legal systems\nbased on Tables 2-A and 2-B alone. First, the scores on creditor and shareholder rights mainly\nmeasure the protection of owners of publicly traded companies. As above, the stock market and\nprivate ownership of corporations are recent phenomena. More importantly, these scores measure\nthe legal system on paper, not in practice. Even though the Chinese government has adopted\n\nvarious protection measures into the law, from which we calculated the scores, one can argue that\na more important measure for the status of the legal system would be law enforcement. Table 2-C\nprovides some evidence in this regard. It is important to note that all the measures, including those\nfor China, are drawn from independent international rating agencies. For two key categories of law\nenforcement, the rule of law and corruption, China's measures are significantly below all average\nmeasures of LLSV sample countries, regardless of their legal origins. This suggests that the\nrelatively high scores of creditor- and shareholder-protections of China in Tables 2-A and 2-B are\nnot reliable.\nInsert Tables 2-C and 2-D here.\nWe also compare China's legal system to other emerging countries, similar to the growth\ncomparison in Table 1-B. From Table 2-D, we can see that China's \"corruption\" index is the worst\namong the seven developing countries, while its measure of anti-director rights (creditor rights) is\nonly higher than that of India and Mexico (Argentina and Mexico). Hence the development of\nChina's legal system is not ahead of any other major emerging economies, and it is clearly\ndominated by those that have English common-law origin (India, Pakistan, and South Africa).\nIn order to have an effective law enforcement system, a country must have a sufficient\nsupply of qualified legal professionals. 12 By one estimate, there are currently 150,000 lawyers in\nChina, roughly the same number of licensed attorneys as in the state of California.13 Lawyers\nrepresent only 10% to 25% of all clients in civil and business cases, and even in criminal\n12 Djankov et al. (2003a, DLLS hereafter) compare the efficiency and formalism of the justice system across 109\ncountries. Consistent with other LLSV findings, they find justice systems in common law countries are more efficient\nthan civil law countries and in particular, developing countries. The results are based on how two specific types of\ndisputes, the eviction of a tenant and collection of a bounced check, are resolved in a country's judicial system. China\nis included in the data, and its justice system actually ranks high relative to other socialist and developing countries.\nBut these rankings are misleading since both types of disputes are rare events in China, as the real estate including the\nrental market as well as the market for the use of personal checks are under-developed, and limited in only a few large\ncities.\n\nprosecutions they represent defendants in only half of the cases. Among the approximately five\nmillion business enterprises in China, only 4% of them currently have regular legal advisers.\nMoreover, only one-fifth of all lawyers in China have law degrees, and even a lower fraction of\njudges have formally studied law at a university or college. Needless to say, it will be a long time\nbefore China has a strong legal labor force. Another reason that many of the new laws will not be\neffectively enforced in China is the intrinsic conflict of interests between \"fair play\" in practicing\nlaw and the monopoly power of the single ruling party, especially in cases where government\nofficials or their affiliates are involved. Fortunately for investors and entrepreneurs, some\nindependent judicial authority seems to be evolving in the area of business law.\nFinally, we comment on the current status of China's accounting system.14 The reform\nstarted in 1992, with the enactment of regulations governing the enterprises with foreign\ninvestment, which provided the necessary accounting infrastructure to assist companies in\nattracting foreign direct investment. The ASBE (Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises)\nof China, together with the 13-industry regulation board, have been trying to move China's\naccounting practice in the Listed Sector toward the IAS (International Accounting Standards).\nHowever, the most glaring problem in China's accounting system is the lack of independent,\nprofessional auditors, similar to the situation of legal professionals. This implies that the proposed\nIAS-based standards may be counterproductive within China's current infrastructure: with few\nauditors understanding the new standards and enforcing them, and the lack of an effective judicial\nsystem, embezzlement of company's assets and frauds may occur more frequently under IAS-\n13 Information presented here is from Orts (2001). In addition, from the official website of Ministry of Justice of China\n(in Chinese: http://www.legalinfo.gov.cn/gb/moj/introduce.htm), there are about 110,000 lawyers and 9,000 law firms\nin China as of 2002.\n14 See Xiang (1998) for more information. We thank Arnold Wright and Mohamed Hussein for pointing out this\nsource to us.\n\nbased standards, as compared to an alternative system with a much simpler set of accounting\nstandards.\nTo summarize, China's legal system is underdeveloped relative to most countries,\nincluding other major developing countries. By the arguments of LLSV and Levine, China's poor\nlegal system tends to hinder the development of corporate governance mechanisms of Chinese\ncompanies, their fund raising through capital markets, and their growth as well as the growth of\nthe overall economy. What we argue is that this prediction ignores how well alternative\nmechanisms can replace formal legal system.\nII.3 Financial System\nWe first examine China's financial system at the aggregate level, including both its\nbanking system and financial markets. We then examine its stock exchanges in more detail and\nalso briefly discuss its venture capital markets. Finally, we examine the problems in the banking\nsector.\nInsert Table 3 here.\nIn Table 3 we compare China's financial system to those of LLSV (1997, 1998) sample\ncountries, using measures from Levine (2002). We first compare the size of a country's equity\nmarkets and banks relative to that country's GDP. China's stock markets, which did not exist until\n1990 but have been growing very fast, are smaller than most of the other countries, both in terms\nof market capitalization and the total value traded as fractions of GDP.15 By contrast, China's\nbanking system is much more important in terms of size relative to its stock markets, with its ratio\nof total bank credit to GDP (1.11) higher than even the German-origin countries (with a weighted\naverage of 0.99). However, when we consider bank credit issued (or loans made) to the Private\n15 Note that \"total value traded\" is a better measure than \"market capitalization\" because the latter includes non-\ntradable shares, while the former measures the \"floating supply\" of shares in the markets, or the fraction of total\nmarket cap traded in the markets. See Table 4-A of this section and Section IV below for further discussions.\n\nSector only, China's ratio dropped sharply to 0.24, suggesting that most of the bank credit is\nissued to companies in the State and Listed Sectors. Moreover, China's banking system is not\nefficient: its overhead cost to total assets (0.12) is much higher than the average of French-origin\ncountries (0.05), the next highest group of countries. The second panel of Table 3 compares the\nrelative importance of financial markets vs. banks (\"Structure indices\"). China has the lowest\nscores for both \"Structure Activity\" and \"Structure size\" categories, suggesting that China's\nbanking sector is much larger than its financial markets, and this dominance by the banks over\nmarkets is stronger than the average of all LLSV sample countries.16\nWe also compare the development of the entire financial system (\"Financial\nDevelopment\"), including both banks and markets, in the last panel of Table 3. If we use all bank\ncredit (including to the State and Listed sectors) then China's overall financial market size\n(\"Finance Activity\" and \"Finance Size\") lies in the middle of the pack among those LLSV\ncountries. However, given that all other countries' measures were based on private bank credit\nonly, if we re-calculate China's financial system the same way, we find that it is not as large as the\nLLSV sample average level, and is only higher than the French-origin countries' average. In terms\nof the efficiency of the financial system, China's measure is below all sub-samples of LLSV\ncountries.17 Based on the above evidence, we can conclude that China's financial system is\ndominated by a large but inefficient banking sector.\nFinancial Markets\n16 \"Structure activity\" and \"Structure size\" are relative size measures, with a smaller value indicating that the\ncountry's financial markets are smaller than its banking system. We also compare \"Structure efficiency,\" in Table 3,\nwhich is the relative efficiency of markets vs. banks. Since China has the highest score, it seems that China's stock\nmarkets are actually relatively more efficient than banks, compared to other countries. Again this result is mainly\ndriven by the extremely high costs of China's banking system.\n17 We also examine the trend of financial system development in China in the 1990s. It is clear that: 1) the overall size\nof both markets and banks is growing; 2) banks dominate the markets even though markets are becoming more\nimportant relative to banks; 3) efficiency (both in terms of banks and the overall system) remains low.\n\nFrom Table 4-A, China's domestic stock exchanges, SHSE and SZSE, with their combined\nsize or volume, rank the 9th among the largest stock exchanges in the world. In addition, the Hong\nKong Stock Exchange (HKSE hereafter), where selected firms from Mainland China can now be\nlisted and traded, is ranked 8th in the world by itself.18 If we rank the combined size of all stock\nexchanges in a country, China would rank the 5th, behind only the US, Japan, UK, and France.\nAs fast as the growth of China's stock markets has been, they are not efficient in that\nprices and investors' behavior do not reflect fundamental values of listed firms. Again from Table\n4, \"Concentration\" measures the fraction of total turnover of the market within 2000 that is due to\nthe trading and turnover of companies within the largest market cap quintile. Large cap stocks in\nChina are not frequently traded and the concentration ratio, 2.73%, is much lower than any other\nmajor stock exchange in the world (Frankfurt has the second lowest concentration ratio -- 45.3%).\nOn the other hand, medium- and small-cap stocks are traded extremely frequently in China, as\nshown by the extremely high \"Turnover Velocity,\" defined as the total turnover for the year\nexpressed as a percentage of total market cap. China's velocity of 500% is even much higher than\nthat of NASDAQ with the well-known trading patterns of technology stocks in recent years.\nConsistent with our findings, Morck et al. (2000) find that stock prices are more synchronous in\nemerging countries, including China, than in developed countries. They contribute this\nphenomenon to poor minority investor protection and imperfect regulation of markets in emerging\nmarkets. In particular, they argue that poor protection of minority investors makes rumors more\ninfluential on moving sectors of stock returns, while informed risk arbitrage becomes less\n18 However, a fraction of all the (equity) shares is non-tradable. See Section IV.1 for details. Nevertheless, total\nmarket capitalization using tradable shares reached US$170 billion in 2001.\n\nprofitable. As a result, stock prices are more likely to move away from and do not reflect firm\nspecific information.19\nInsert Table 4-A and 4-B here.\nNext, we briefly examine the role of financial markets in helping firms raising funds\n(LLSV 1997). The evidence is presented in Table 4-B. From the comparison of the external capital\nmarkets, it is clear that financing via financial markets in China is different from the LLSV sample\ncountries, in that both the scale and relative importance (compared with other channels of\nfinancing) of the external markets is not significant. For example, for the ratio of External Capital\nand GNP, the LLSV sample average is 40%, compared to China's 10%; for the ratio of total debt\n(including bank loans and bonds) over GNP, the LLSV sample average is 59%, compared to\nChina's 22%.20 We provide firm-level evidence on financing in Section IV below.\nIn summary, the overall evidence on the comparison of China and other countries' external\nmarkets is consistent with LLSV (1997, 1998) predictions: with an under-developed legal system,\nthe fact that China has small external markets comes as no surprise. Figure 1 compares China's\nlegal system and external financial markets to those of LLSV countries. The horizontal axis\nmeasures overall investor protection in each country, while the vertical axis measures the (relative)\nsize and efficiency of that country's external markets.21 Countries with English common-law\nsystems (e.g., US, UK) lie in the top-right region of the graph, while those with French civil-law\nsystems (e.g., France, Argentina) lie in the bottom-left region. Consistent with LLSV predictions\n19 One example of the imperfect regulations is the restriction on short sales. Bris et al. (2003) find that limiting short\nsales contributes to the high co-movement of stock prices, but does not tend to increase the probability of a market\ncrash, as commonly feared by governments in emerging countries.\n20 However, if we include debt issued to all sectors including State and Listed Sectors, this ratio increases to 79%,\nsuggesting that the majority of \"debt\" does not go through the capital markets but rather through a centralized system,\nand consistent with evidence on bank credit.\n21 Following LLSV (1997, 1998, 2000), the score on the horizontal axis is the sum of (overall) creditor rights,\nshareholder rights (anti-director rights and one-share, one-vote), rule of law, and finally, the corruption index of the\ngovernment, while the score of the vertical axis indicates the distance of a country's overall external markets score\n\non the relation between legal system and external markets, China is placed close to the bottom left\ncorner of the graph.\nInsert Figure 1 here.\nFinally, we briefly discuss China's venture capital markets. It is often argued that one of\nthe reasons the US has been so successful in recent years in developing new industries is the\nexistence of a strong venture capital sector.22 Allen and Gale (2000a) suggest that venture capital\nshould be thought of as closer to market finance rather than intermediated finance, because\nventure capitalists can easily cash out by selling firms in the IPO market, which makes them\nwilling to provide seed capital initially. Since its inception in the 1980s, China's venture capital\nindustry has enjoyed fast growth, in particular since 1992. Consistent with our previous findings,\nChina's venture capital industry, measured by US standards, is under-developed and its role in\nsupporting the growth of young firms is very limited. For example, based on interviews conducted\nwith 36 venture capitalists in 24 venture companies, Bruton and Ahlstrom (2002) find that the\nlimited formal rules and regulations are often ineffective, while alternative mechanisms based on\nreputation and relationship are the norm in all stages and phases of the industry.\nBanking Sector\nChina's banking sector is dominated by four large and inefficient, state-owned banks. As\nreported in LLS (2002), the government owns an average of 99.45% of the 10 largest commercial\nbanks in China as of 1995 (it was 100% in 1970), and this ownership level is one of the highest in\ntheir sample of 92 countries. Moreover, the LLS (2002) results on the negative relationship of\ngovernment ownership of banks and the growth of a country's economy seems to apply to China's\n(external cap/GNP, domestic firms/Pop, IPOs/Pop, Debt/GNP, and Log GNP) to the mean of all countries, with a\npositive (negative) figure indicating that this country's overall score is higher (lower) than the mean.\n22 For example, Kortum and Lerner (2000) have documented a strong relationship in the US between the extent to\nwhich venture capital is used in an industry and the rate of patenting.\n\nState Sector, and the status quo of its banking sector. However, the high government ownership\nhas not slowed down the growth of the most important sector of the economy, the Private Sector.\nThe most glaring problem for China's banking sector is the amount of NPLs within the\nfour largest state-owned banks. A large fraction of these bad loans results from poor lending\ndecisions made for SOEs, some of which were due to political or other non-economic reasons, and\nthese loans accumulated over the years without ever being resolved. The additional problem is that\ndata availability on NPLs is limited, which can be viewed as a strategic disclosure decision of the\ngovernment. But this lack of disclosure of NPLs only fuels speculations that the problem must be\nsevere. As Lardy (1995) argues, if using international standards on NPLs, the existing NPLs\nwithin the state-owned banks as of mid-1990s can make these banks' total net worth to be\nnegative so that they are in effect insolvent.\nInsert Tables 5-A and 5-B here.\nTables 5-A and 5-B compare NPLs and banking system profitability in China and other\nmajor Asian economies in more recent years. First, as Table 5-A indicates, NPLs, either as a\nfraction of total new loans made by all banks or as a fraction of GDP in a given year, are the\nhighest in China from 2000-2002.23 This comparison includes the period during which Asian\ncountries recovered from the 1997 financial crisis, and the period during which the Japanese\nbanking system was disturbed by the bad loan problem. Second, as Table 5-B indicates, the\nprofitability of China's banking system, measured by the return to equity or assets, is also among\nthe lowest in the group of countries.\nIn recent years the Chinese government has taken active measures to solve this problem.\nFirst, four state-owned asset management companies were formed with the goal of assuming these\n23 Information on NPLs first became available in 1998. However, the figures in 1998 and 1999 probably significantly\nunderestimate the actual size of NPLs, and are ignored in our discussions.\n\nNPLs and liquidating them.24 Second, state-owned banks have improved their loan structure by\nincreasing loans made to individual lenders while being more active in risk management and\nmonitoring of loans made to SOEs.25 Third, there has been a boom in the entry and growth of\nnon-state financial intermediaries within the banking system. For example, in 1997, total new\nloans made by the four largest state-owned banks accounted for more than 75% of all new loans,\nwhile new loans made by \"shareholding\" banks accounted for less than 7%.26 In 2001 the share of\nnew loans made by state-owned banks dropped to 49% while the fraction of new loans made by\nshareholding banks rose to 23.5%. This trend is expected to continue with more foreign banks\nentering the domestic credit markets in the near future as a result of China's entrance into the\nWTO. All the above facts taken together can explain why NPLs have been falling in recent years,\nas shown in Table 5-A.\nTo summarize, the continuing effort of reforming and improving the banking system is one\nof the most important tasks for China in the near future. In fact, China recently announced that its\ncentral bank will inject foreign currency reserves, in the amount of US$85 billion, into 2 of the big\n4 state-owned banks, to improve their balance sheets and enhance the likelihood that these banks\ncan go public by the end of 2004. Similar fund injection plans for the other 2 state-owned banks\nare also in the works.27 Given that China's total foreign exchange reserve is US$400 billion while\nthe total amount of NPLs as of 2002 is 15% of GDP, or US$188 billion using the US$1 = 8.26\nRMB exchange rate, the foreign reserve itself should be more than enough to rid the NPLs off the\n24 Information from auction data shows that the cash recovery on some of the loans ranges from 8% to 60%. Details\non these Asset Management companies (including the auctions of NPLs), are available from the authors upon request.\n25 For example, the ratio of consumer lending to total loans made for the four state-owned banks increased from 1% in\n1998 to 10% in 2002. Moreover, mortgage lending by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the largest bank\nin China, had grown by 32 times during the 1998-2002 period. The source for the above data is The Almanac of\nFinance and Banking in China (2001 and 2002), and The Economist, January 2003 (pp. 68).\n26 Owners for these shareholding banks include local government, foreign banks, and individuals. Most of these banks\nare not publicly listed and traded.\n\nbooks of all the banks in China.28 Whether the government will do exactly this remains to be\nseen, but it is clear that the ultimate source of eliminating NPLs lies in the overall economic\ngrowth. As long as the economy maintains its strong growth momentum so that the government's\ntaxable income also increases, the government can always assume the remainder of the NPLs\nwithout significantly affecting the economy.\nII.4 Growth in the State, Listed, and Private Sectors\nTable 6-A compares the growth of industrial output produced in the State and Listed\nSectors vs. that of the Private Sector from 1996 to 2002. It is clear that the Private Sector\ndominates the State and Listed Sectors in terms of either the size of the output,29 or in terms of the\ngrowth trend. From Panel A of Table 6-A, the Private Sector grew at an annual rate of 14.3%\nbetween 1996 and 2002, while the State and Listed Sectors combined grew at only 5.4% during\nthe same period.30 In addition, the growth rates for investment in fixed assets of these two sectors\nare comparable (Panel B of Table 6-A), which imply that the Private Sector is actually more\nproductive than the State and Listed Sectors. Finally, there has been a fundamental change among\nthe State, Listed, and Private Sectors in terms of their contribution to the entire economy: the State\nSector contributed 76% of China's total industrial output in 1980, but in 1996 it only contributed\n28.5%; in 1980 individually owned firms, a type of Private Sector firms, are negligible, but in\n27 China's RMB has been pegged to US dollar (only) at 8.28 to 1. The foreign exchange reserves are in the form of US\ndollars (in cash), T-bills, and other dollar denominated debt securities. See for example, Financial Times (01/09/2004)\nand Asia Wall Street Journal (01/13/2004) for more details.\n28 One potential risk for using foreign reserve to boost the banking system is the pressure of significant RMB\nappreciation relative to US$ and other major foreign currencies. Necessary hedging strategies should be planned by\nthe banks, in addition to tighten the currency flow as it has been the case.\n29 Total output in 1999 is US$1200 billion for the Private Sector, while it is around US$400 billion in the State and\nListed Sectors combined.\n30 There is an ongoing process of privatizing SOEs. Potentially this may bias the growth rate of the Private Sector\nhigher, as there are firms shifting from the State Sector to the Private Sector. However, the overwhelming majority of\nSOEs are transformed into publicly traded firms (the Listed Sector). Thus this process is unlikely to change the\nvalidity of the results above.\n\n1996 they contributed 15.5% of total industrial output, and the above trend of the Private Sector\nreplacing the State Sector will continue in the near future.\nInsert Tables 6-A and 6-B here.\nTable 6-B presents the number of non-agricultural employees in the three sectors. The\nPrivate Sector is a much more important source for employment opportunities than the other\nsectors. Over the period from 1995 to 2002, the Private Sector employs an average of over 70% of\nall non-agricultural workers, while the TVEs (a type of Private Sector firm) are by far the most\nimportant employer for workers from the rural areas. Moreover, the number of employees\nworking in the Private Sector has been growing at 1.5% over this seven-year period, while the\nlabor force in the State Sector has been shrinking. These patterns are particularly important for\nChina, given its vast population and potential problem of unemployment.\nIII. Firms' Financing Sources: Aggregate Evidence and Cross-country Comparisons\nIn this section we compare, at the aggregate level, how firms raise funds in China and in\nLLSV sample countries with the emphasis on emerging economies. It is worthwhile then to study\nwhat other channels of financing are playing the role of substituting for external capital markets\nand standard, textbook financing channels.\nIII.1 China's Most Important Financing Channels\nThe four most important financing sources for all firms in China, in terms of fixed assets\ninvestments, are: (domestic) bank loans, firms' self-fundraising (or fundraising for short), state\nbudget, and foreign direct investment.31 By far the two most important sources of financing\nchannels are self-fundraising and bank loans. Consistent with previous evidence on China's\n31 Detailed information on all the financing channels is available from the \"Almanac of China's finance and banking\"\n(2000-2003), and from the authors upon request.\n\nbanking sector, bank loans, including loans from the non-state banks, provide a large amount of\nfunds to firms, and constitute a large fraction of firms' total financing needs. For example, firms in\nthe State Sector rely on bank loans to raise more than 25% of their total financing needs. A similar\npattern holds for jointly- and collectively-owned companies, both of which belong to the Private\nSector. Our survey evidence, to be presented in Section V, also indicates that bank loans are\nimportant financing sources, especially during the start-up period of Private Sector firms.\nSelf-fundraising includes proceeds from capital raised from local governments (beyond\nstate budget) and communities and other investors, internal financing channels such as retained\nearnings, and all other funds raised domestically by the firms.32 First, the size of total self-\nfundraising of all firms has been growing very fast over the period of 1994-2002, at an average\nannual rate of 14%. At the end of 2002, total self-fundraising (for the purpose of fixed assets\ninvestment) reached US$275.5 billion, compared to a total of US$106.6 billion domestic bank\nloans for the same year. It is important to point out that equity and bond issuance, which are\nincluded in self-fundraising, apply only to the Listed Sector, and account for a small fraction of\nthis category. Second, self-fundraising is the most important source of financing for many types of\nfirms. For example, individually owned companies (of the Private Sector), not surprisingly, rely\nmostly on self-fundraising (about 90% of total financing). Interestingly, even for state- or quasi-\nstate-owned companies, self-fundraising is also important in that it captures somewhere between\n45% and 65% of total financing.\nFinally, state budget and foreign (direct) investments are the other two important financing\nsources. As was the case for all socialist countries, China used to rely on a central planning system\nto allocate the state budget to most of the companies in the country. But state budget now only\n32 Our current data source, the China Statistical Yearbook (2000), does not provide the breakdowns of \"fundraising,\"\nthus we only have the total figures.\n\ncontributes 10% of state-owned companies' total funding. On the other hand, as a financing source\nforeign investment is comparable to state budget, both in terms of aggregate size and in terms of\nthe relative importance in firms' financing. This evidence confirms that China has evolved from a\ncentral planning, closed economy toward an open market economy.\nWith the knowledge on the four financing channels at the aggregate level, we now focus on\ndifferent types of firms' financing decisions. The results are presented in Figures 2-A, 2-B, and 2-\nC. In all of these figures, each of the four connected lines represents the importance of a particular\nfinancing channel over the time period of 1994-2002, measured by the percentage of firms' total\nfinancing coming from this channel.\nFirst, Figure 2-A (2-B) illustrates how firms in the Listed Sector (State Sector) finance\ntheir investment. From Figure 2-A, we can see that just below 30% of publicly traded companies'\nfunding comes from bank loans, and this ratio has been very stable, despite the fast growth of the\nstock markets. Around 45% of Listed Sector's total funding comes from (self-) fundraising,\nincluding internal financing and proceeds from equity and bond issuance.33 The growth of\npublicly traded firms has been impressive, with total market capitalization including non-tradable\nshares reaching US$330 billion at the end of 1999. On the contrary, SOEs are on a downward\ntrend, as privatization of these firms is still in progress. From the information on equity and bond\nsales, we know that these sources of (self-) fundraising that rely on the use of external markets\nonly constitute a small fraction of total funds raised, compared to internal financing and other\nforms of fundraising. Combined with the fact that self-fundraising (bank loans being the second\nmost important source) is also the most important source of financing for the State Sector (Figure\n33 Publicly traded firms also receive funds from the state budget, because some of the firms in this category used to be\nstate-owned, and the funding relationship has not been completely severed. But the state budget is not as important as\nforeign direct investment, which as of 1997 accounts for 9.5% of total financing.\n\n2-B), we can conclude that alternative channels of financing are important even for the State and\nListed Sectors.\nInsert Figures 2-A, 2-B, and 2-C here.\nNext, we consider how firms in the Private Sector raise funds (Figure 2-C). Self-\nfundraising here includes all kinds of internal finance, capital raised from family and friends of the\nfounders and managers, and funds raised in the form of private equity and loans. Clearly, this\ncategory is by far the most important source of financing, with close to 60% of total funds raised\ncoming from this channel. The other fact that we want to stress here is that because firms in this\nsector operate in an environment with poorer legal and financial mechanisms and regulations than\nthose firms in the State and Listed Sectors, all financing sources probably work differently from\nhow they work in the State and Listed Sectors, and those in developed countries. In Section V\nbelow we present detailed evidence on how different types of self-fundraising help Private Sector\nfirms at various stages.\nIII.2 Comparing Financing Channels in Emerging Economies\nWe briefly compare financing channels at the aggregate level in China and other major\nemerging economies in Asia. In particular, we relate the aggregate financing channels with the\ngrowth of the economy during different growth periods, in order to determine whether the Chinese\nexperience in financing is special. First, Figure 3-A compares the development of stock markets at\nthe aggregate level, while Figure 3-D compares the growth rates in GDP. Both Taiwan and South\nKorea experienced high GDP growth in much of the 1970s, while the total market cap of their\nrespective stock markets accounted for less than 20% of their GNPs during the same period, and\nthe growth of stock markets did not take off until mid- to late-1980s. Figure 3-B compares the\ngrowth of corporate bond markets: South Korea having the fastest growth path, while in Taiwan\nand China the corporate bond markets seem to lag the development of stock markets. Finally,\n\nFigure 3-C compares total equity issuance, including IPO and SEO. With the exception of South\nKorea, China seems to be on similar pace in terms of size of equity issuance (as fraction of GNP\nin a given year) with Taiwan and India.\nInsert Figures 3-A, 3-B, 3-C, and 3-D here.\nFrom the above comparisons it is clear that the development of China's external markets\nrelative to its overall economic growth is not dramatically different from other emerging countries\nin Asia. One of the common patterns emerged from these comparisons is that the development of\nexternal markets trails that of the growth of overall economy. This is not surprising given that the\ndevelopment of these markets require minimum efficiency of a country's institutions including\nlegal system, accounting standards, and the development of associated professionals. By contrast,\nduring early stages of the economic growth, alternative institutions and mechanisms alone can\nsupport the growth of firms and overall economy, as is the case for China based on our evidence.\nPerhaps similar institutions have worked well in other emerging and developed economies as well,\nand future research can determine whether the Chinese experience also occurs in other countries.\nIV. Evidence on the Listed Sector\nIn this section, we focus on publicly traded companies and examine their financing and\ninvestment decisions. As stated in the introduction, we want to draw general conclusions on\nwhether there are fundamental differences between the Chinese firms and firms studied in\nprevious papers (LLS 1999, LLSV 1997, 2000b, 2002). Before doing that, let us look at the unique\nownership structure and corporate governance mechanisms in the Chinese firms.\nIV.1 Types of Stock\nTable 7-A introduces the types of stock issued by listed Chinese firms. First, there are\ntradable and nontradable shares. The nontradable shares are either held by the state/government or\n\nby other legal entities, namely other firms (listed or non-listed) or organizations. Through\nnontradable shares, in particular state-owned shares, the government retains (partial) control of\nfirms that used to belong to the State Sector. Among the tradable shares, Classes A and B shares\nare listed and traded in either the SHSE or SZSE, while Class A (B) shares are issued to Chinese\ninvestors (foreign investors including those from Taiwan and Hong Kong). Class H shares can be\nlisted and traded on the HKSE and are issued by selected \"Red Chip\" Chinese companies.\nInsert Tables 7-A, 7-B, and 7-C here.\nFrom Tables 7-B and 7-C, we can see that the ownership structure of a listed company's\nequity in China is different from that observed in many other countries. First, from Table 7-B,\n\"non-tradable\" shares constitute a majority of all shares, while most of non-tradable shares are\nheld by the \"state\". On the other hand, the majority of tradable shares are A shares, or the shares\nheld and traded by Chinese citizens. Second, Tables 7-C provides some evidence on the relation\nbetween ownership and control of the Board of Directors. Information provided here is based on a\nsurvey of corporate governance practices among 257 companies listed on the SHSE conducted in\nthe year 2000 by Integrity Management Consulting and the Research Center of SHSE.34\nConsistent with Tables 7-A and 7-B and the \"one-share, one-vote\" scheme adopted by firms in the\nListed Sector, state and legal person shareholders appoint most of the board members as shown in\nTable 7-C. While selecting 48% of all directors on the board, and taking into account that\nshareholders selected only 76% of all directors in the 257 surveyed companies (the other directors\nwere appointed by the government), state and legal person shareholders, owning 44% of all the\nshares, selected 70% (or 48 out of 76) of those directors that took office through the voting\nprocess.\n34 The survey is based on over 10,000 questionnaires sent to directors, supervisors, and other senior managers in listed\ncompanies. Also see \"Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform in China: Building the institutions of Modern\n\nIV.2 Corporate Governance35\nListed firms in China have a two-tier board structure: the Board of Directors and the Board\nof Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors is a mixture of the German-style supervisory committee\nand China's socialist regime in which employees are also \"owners\" of the enterprises. In recent\nyears there is a trend of modeling listed firms' board structure after that of US corporations. The\nsupervisors of a listed firm are usually either officials chosen from government branches, or\nexecutives from the parent companies. Though they are at the top of the firm's hierarchy, they are,\nmost of the time, supervisors by name only. For example, they are usually paid less than the firm's\ndirectors, who rank below them. The Board of Directors is controlled by the firm's parent\ncompanies. As shown in Table 7-B above, not all directors are elected by the shareholders. The\nrest of them are nominated and appointed by the firms' parent companies and the nomination\nprocess is usually kept secret. Most of the directors are well educated, with 60% of them holding\ngraduate or equivalent degrees. However, incentive pay is rarely explicitly specified in the\ndirectors' compensation packages, but a large fraction of non-pecuniary payments, including perks\nsuch as company cars and subsidized housing, can be linked to firm performance. Since the two-\ntier board system consists of members who are not voted in by the shareholders, it is unlikely that\nthis board structure can effectively monitor firms' managers, because the goals of board and\nsupervisory members are not congruent with each other or with those of the shareholders. Some\nlisted firms do not convene regular board meetings, and some directors do not take the meeting\nrules and their fiduciary duties seriously. In some corporations, directors act as managers or\nexecutives, and the excessive overlap in these positions causes corruption.\nMarket,\" published by the World Bank in 2002, which provides more detailed information on the ownership and\ncontrol structure.\n35 Information presented in this section is based on \"Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform in China: Building\nthe institutions of Modern Market\" (World Bank, 2002), and Schipani and Liu (2002).\n\nThe external corporate governance mechanisms are also limited and weak. First, the\nexisting ownership structure, characterized by cross-holdings of shares among listed companies\nand institutions, makes hostile takeovers virtually impossible. Secondly, institutional investors do\nnot have a strong influence on management or on the stock market. Open-end funds are a very\nrecent addition to the set of financial institutions in China. As for information disclosure, there is a\nlack of qualified accounting and auditing professionals as pointed out earlier. Moreover,\nineffective bankruptcy implementation makes the threat and penalty for bad firm performance\nnon-credible.36\nFinally, the government plays the dual roles of regulator and blockholder of many listed\nfirms. The China Securities Regulation Committee (CSRC) is the counterpart of the SEC in the\nUS, and its main role is to monitor and regulate stock exchanges and listed companies. While the\ngovernment exercises their shareholder control rights in listed firms mainly through state-owned\nasset management companies, which hold large fractions of the state shares. However, since the\ntop officials of these asset management companies are elected by the government, it is doubtful\nthat they will pursue their fiduciary role as control shareholders diligently. Moreover, the\ngovernment's dual roles can lead to conflicting goals in dealing with listed firms, which in turn\nweakens the effectiveness of both of its roles.\nIV.3 Evidence on Ownership, Financing, Dividend and Valuation\nIn this section, we examine and compare various characteristics of listed firms in China\nwith those of other countries. Our results on China's Listed Sector are based a sample (panel data)\nof more than 1100 listed firms that we collected from SHSE and SZSE, for the period of 1992-\n36 Cross-country information on the efficiency in bankruptcy procedure, based on survey of lawyers and bankruptcy\njudges around the world, is available from World Bank (http://rru.worldbank.org/Doingbusiness). Among 108\ncountries, China's \"goals of insolvency\" index is equal to the median of the sample.\n\n2000.37 Table 8-A presents the summary statics of a \"snapshot\" of the sample firms at the end of\n2000: the average market cap is US$ 448 million (median is US$ 355 million), the average\nleverage ratio, measured by the ratio of long-term debt and common equity, is 32% (median is\n9%). In short, these are large firms operating in virtually all industries.\nTable 8-B compares the ownership structure of these firms to those from LLS (1999)\nsample, which includes over 1000 listed companies from 33 countries. The main result of LLS\n(1999) is that countries that protect minority shareholders poorly (strongly) tend to have more\nconcentrated (dispersed) ownership, as shown in the first two panels of Table 8-B. Consistent with\nthe prediction from Burkart et al. (2003), Claessens et al. (2000) show that family firm is the\ndominant form of ownership structure in Asia, where the protections of minority shareholders are\nin general weak. In the last row of Table 8-B, the ownership structure of listed firms in China is\ncloser to that of other Asian firms documented in Claessens et al. (2000), than to LLS (1999)\nresults. First, consistent with our previous evidence on ownership structure, the dominant owner of\n60% of our sample firms is the (central) government. Second, for 13.6% of firms the dominant\nowner is founders' families, while only 0.44% of all firms are widely held, so that no shareholder\nowns more than 10% of stocks. Third, for 24.17% (1.83%) of firms, the dominant shareholder is a\nfinancial company (another listed firm).38\nTable 8-C provides some evidence on financing sources at the firm level. The ratios for all\nthe countries (except for China) in the table are taken from LLSV (1997). In LLSV (1997), a ratio\n(e.g., market cap/sales) for a country is obtained by first finding the median of this ratio (market\ncap/sales) across firms within various industries of that country, and then by taking the average of\n37 These data sets are available from \"Asia Emerging Market Data Base\" of the Taiwan Economic Journal\n(http://www.tei.com.tw/main.html).\n38 Since we do not have ownership data for this financial company (listed firm), we do not know whether this\ncompany (listed firm) is widely held or not. But given the fact that state-ownership is prevalent in listed firms and\nbanks, it is reasonable to assume that they are not widely held.\n\nthe medians across industries to obtain the ratio for the country. A similar procedure is taken to\nfind the ratios for China using our panel data set of listed firms. Finally, we take the average\n(median) ratios across groups of countries according to their legal origins, and compare them to\nthose of China. The evidence in Table 8-C is consistent with previous evidence at the aggregate\nlevel: in terms of total equity, the listed Chinese companies do not rely on the external markets as\nmuch as their counterparts in LLSV countries, but they rely heavily on debt, in particular bank\ndebt, more so than other LLSV countries.\nFinally, we examine dividend policy and valuations of listed firms in China, and compare\nthem to firms studied by LLSV (2000b, 2002). Making the most out of the available data,39 we\nperformed three different sets of empirical tests and find similar results. Detailed descriptions of\nthese tests are presented in Appendix B. First, LLSV (2000b) find that firms in countries with\npoorer protection of outside shareholders tend to have lower dividends due to more severe agency\nproblems. Using dividend/earnings ratio as a proxy for dividend policy, we find that on average\nChinese firms tend to under-pay dividends to their shareholders compared to firms in countries\nstudied in LLSV (2000b). Second, LLSV (2002) find that firms in countries poorer protection of\noutside shareholders tend to have lower Tobin's Q, measured by the market-to-book assets ratios.\nWhen we examine Tobin's Q of listed firms in China, we cannot reject the hypothesis that on\naverage their Tobin's Q is lower compared to countries with better shareholder protections (LLSV\n2002).\nOverall, because investor protections are weak (and agency problem is severe) in the\nListed Sector in China, both dividend ratio and Tobin's Q are low compared to similar firms\noperating in countries with stronger investor protections. These results confirm that LLSV\n39 The data sets that we employ include: 1) accounting and financial information for 1100+ listed firms from China\n(1990-2000); 2) LLSV (2000b, 2002) results are based on information for over 4100 firms from 33 countries (1989-\n\npredictions work well for China's Listed Sector that includes many firms converted from the State\nSector, and is also consistent with evidence presented in Figure 1.\nV. Evidence on the Private Sector\nIn this section we study how firms in the Private Sector raise funds, their various growth\npaths, and the alternative mechanisms employed by owners that can substitute for formal corporate\ngovernance mechanisms. Due to data limitations, much of this evidence is by necessity anecdotal\nor by survey.40 We first present evidence based on a survey of 17 firms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang\nprovinces in Section V.1, and then we expand our evidence to two highly successful regions of\nPrivate Sector firms in Section V.2. Finally, Section V.3 provides discussions of our evidence.\nV.1 Survey Evidence41\nAs Table 9 shows, among the 17 firms that we surveyed, one firm is from Shanghai, three\nare from Jiangsu Province, and the rest 13 are from Zhejiang Province. These firms operate in a\nwide range of industries. The average age of the firm is over 11 years, and they employ an average\nof over 1600 employees. The average size of (book) assets is US$55 million, with average return\non assets being 10%. Finally, on average firms are highly levered, with average debt/ (private)\nequity ratio reaching 2.1. Figure 4-A presents more background information about the firms. First,\nthere exist significant variations in both firms' past performance, in terms of average annual\nreturns to assets in the past 5 years, and their expected future annual returns in the next 3 years\n(top two histograms of Figure 4-A). Second, in terms of ownership structure, both at the time of\n1994), while detailed firm-level data for LLSV sample are not available to us; but we do have their cross-sectional\nsummary statistics by country, as well as the regression results across countries.\n40 To our knowledge, with the exception of some well-known firms who voluntarily provide information to the public,\nfirm-level information (financial, accounting, or operational) is non-existent for most Private Sector firms.\n41 The survey questions, as well as the tabulation of answers, are available at\nhttp://www2.bc.edu/~qianju/research.html. In designing our survey forms, we follow Graham and Harvey (2001,\nsurvey of US CFOs), Johnson, McMillan, and Woodruff (2002, survey of 5 former Communist countries in Eastern\n\nstartup and current status, the two dominant forms are \"founder and family,\" and \"shareholding\"\n(resembles a private equity structure), while partnership is not a widely used ownership structure.\nThird, about 35% of the founders of our sample firms worked in TVEs prior to starting up their\nown firms, while 23% (18%) of the founders worked in SOEs (government agencies). The\nexperience from the State Sector or other Private Sector firms is valuable for these entrepreneurs,\nas they gained knowledge on how to run a private firm and/or deal with government officials.\nFinancing Channels\nFigure 4-B presents evidence of financing channels of the firms. First, it is not surprising\nthat during the startup stage, funds from founders' family and friends are important source of\nfinancing. Moreover, funds from friends, in the form of private loans and equity, are also very\nimportant during the firm's subsequent growth period (top right histogram in Figure 4-B). Second,\nfunding from financial intermediaries is probably the most important source for the surveyed\nfirms: over 40% of firms surveyed regard banks as either a \"very important\" (25-50% of funding)\nor an \"extremely important\" (more than 50% of total funding) financing source. This evidence\nagain highlights the importance of the banking sector in China. Among financial intermediaries,\nthe four largest state-owned banks are ranked the highest in terms of providing funds, while other\nstate-owned banks are ranked second. However, it is not clear that state-owned banks provide the\ncheapest, most convenient start-up financing channel for all Private Sector firms. The important\ncaveat here is that for almost all the surveyed firms that received start-up financing from state-\nowned banks had already established close relationship with those banks before the inception of\nthe firms. This is possible because these firms originated by \"spinning off\" from state-owned or\nEurope), and McMillan and Woodruff (1999a, 1999b, survey done in Vietnam on trade credits and resolution of\ndisputes).\n\ncollectively-owned firms (or purchasing assets from the latter), while the latter firms typically\nhave good relationship with state-owned banks.\nDuring the firms' subsequent growth period, financing from private credit agencies is the\nmost important channel. These non-state lenders usually charge very high interest rates and/or\nrequire large amount of collateral on loans, can force liquidation should the entrepreneurs default,\nand the associated loan contracts resemble junk bonds to a certain degree. Interestingly, loans from\nstate-owned banks are no longer the dominant source of funding during the growth period. On\naverage, each surveyed firm currently has loan relationship with 4.3 banks/financial institutions,\nwith the maximum (minimum) being 12 (1). Collateral value counts an average of 82.6% of the\nloan value on average (among the 11 firms which answered this question), with maximum 120%\nand minimum 20%. Fixed asset is the most popular form of collateral, and third party guarantee\nbeing the second most popular form. These facts imply that financial institutions, state or private,\nseem to understand the risk of a start-up firm and \"price\" this risk accordingly in their loan\ncontracts.\nDuring firms' growth period (Figure 4-B), there are a few other channels that are important\nsources of financing, in particular, investment from \"ethnic Chinese\" investors (from Hong Kong,\nTaiwan, and overseas Chinese). This financing source, as compared to investment from non-\nChinese foreign investment (FDI), relies on relationship between the investors and the\nentrepreneurs, as well as the reputation of the entrepreneurs. Other sources include trade credits\namong business partners, state and local budget, and foreign direct investment (FDI) from non-\nChinese investors, while investment from venture capitalists (VC) is not widely used during either\nthe start-up stage or the growth period.\nFor start-up firms, securing land and other fixed assets is important for their survival.\nWhile not reported in the figures, more than half of surveyed firms purchase the \"operation-rights\"\n\nof the land from the government, who has the ultimate control. The operation-rights contract is\nlong-term, between 20-50 years.42 In terms of fixed assets, 16 out of the 17 firms purchased and\nown all of their fixed assets. Among them, 9 firms purchased their fixed assets from the State\nSector, and 7 out of the 9 firms considered the price they paid to be the same as market value of\nthe assets. There is one firm's executive indicated that for the rental portion of fixed assets from\nSOE, there is no formal contracts between the firm and the SOE.\nNext, when asked about the prospects of going public, founders and executives list \"access\nto large scale of funding\" and \"reputation increase\" as the most important benefits, and the\n\"disclosure of valuable information to competitors and outsiders\" and \"large amount of fees paid\nto the government, investment banks, and consulting firms\" as the most critical disadvantages of\ngoing public. We also asked the founders and executives about the degree of difficulty in receiving\nfunding through a certain channel. 80% of the firms regard short-term bank loans as \"easy\" to\nhave access to and are \"low costs,\" while around 55% of firms regard long-term bank loans as\n\"easy and low cost.\" Around 50% of firms also believe trade credits among firms and funds from\nfamily and friends as \"easy and low cost.\" These forms of financing channels reduce the cost of\ncapital for firms because reputation and relationships help resolve the potential problems of\nasymmetric information and agency costs.\nCorporate Governance\nFigure 4-C provides some information on governance mechanisms. First, over 60% (30%)\nof firms believe that if their own firm is not run efficiently, it is \"possible\" (\"very likely\") to have\nits assets purchased (or \"taken over\") by another firm or investor, while no one answered it is \"not\npossible\" for this to occur. Not reported in the figure, we also asked firms about product market\n42 With operation rights, a firm has more control over the land than under a \"land rental\" contract. For example, firms\ncan rent the land to another party once obtaining the operation rights from the government. Land rental contracts have\nshorter terms on average (5-10 years).\n\ncompetition. Forty percent of surveyed firms' founders/executives believe that if their firm is not\noperating efficiently, within 3-6 months, 20% of its market share will be taken away, while 80%\nof firms' founders/executives believe the entire market share of the firm will be taken away in two\nyears. When asked about what type of losses concern them the most if the firm failed (top right\nhistogram in Figure 4-C), every firm's founders/executives (100%) said reputation loss is a major\nconcern, while only 60% of them said economic losses are of major concern.\nThe success of a firm in the Private Sector depends crucially on whether the local\ngovernment supports the firm or not. In the bottom histogram of Figure 4-C, we asked firms about\ntheir relationship with the government officials. Over 40% of survey firms state the local\ngovernment \"support\" the growth of the firm without demanding profit sharing, while for some\nother firms, the government is either a partial owner or demand profit sharing without investing in\nthe firm. The supportive attitude of the government toward firms in the Private Sector is\nremarkable considering the fact that the Chinese government is widely regarded as corrupt and not\nrespecting property rights of private citizens.\nV.2 Further Evidence for Firms in Two Successful Regions\nWenZhou -- Village Chambers\nWenzhou, a city in the Zhejiang Province, is the home of some of the earliest and most\nsuccessful firms of the Private Sector. Entrepreneurs in the region are known for their keen\nbusiness sense and sharp management skills, and they often lead the Private Sector in terms of\ninnovation.43 They usually start their family-run businesses in townships with a similar product\nemphasis, in order to have the easy access to the necessary technology, management skills, and\npotential clients and partners. Thus we observe specialization by regions (e.g., Town A produces\n43 McMillan and Naughton (1992), McMillan and Woodruff (2002) point out entrepreneurs facilitate the transition\nfrom planning economy to market-based economy by, for example, starting up firms and entering industries\ndominated by state-owned enterprises.\n\nshoes, Town B shirts, Town C umbrellas, etc.). This specialization can be a result of firms'\nattempt to signal to potential customers that they are competitive in an industry by locating the\nfirm in the region filled with other firms producing and selling similar products. During recent\nyears certain developed areas have shifted product emphasis from labor-intensive products such as\nclothes to more high-tech products, for example, parts of radios, TVs, and computers.\nThe failure rate for start-ups in most industries is high. New product strategies often start\nwith mimicking successful or popular products. Some of these products are labor intensive while\nothers require skillful labors and craftsmen. Patent laws are difficult to implement so often\ndisputes are settled among the entrepreneurs themselves. To overcome this problem, some\nentrepreneurs expend effort and money to ensure that the key parts of their new products are\ndifficult to disassemble and to copy. Another product strategy for many entrepreneurs is that they\noften aim at \"exporting\" their products to other regions, including to foreign countries, instead of\nselling them locally.\nKUNSHAN --- Foreign Direct Investment and the Separation of Ownership and Control\nKunshan County, which is in Jiangsu province and close to Shanghai, is famous for\nattracting foreign direct investment, especially from Taiwanese investors. Some of the most\neffective government policies have included setting up special development zones with favorable\nland and tax policies. For example, in 1997, Kunshan set up a high-tech development zone, to\nattract foreign investment for building factories within the zone. Enterprises, in the ownership\nform of joint ventures, cooperatives, and solely owned by foreign investors, can take full\nadvantage of a tax waiver and tax reduction for the initial periods. Moreover, firms whose high-\ntech products are export-oriented can enjoy even more tax advantages. There is a center in the\n\nspecial zone established by the local government.44 It acts as the liaison between the local\ngovernment, entrepreneurs, and foreign investors, and the regulator as well as service provider for\nenterprises operating in the zone.\nEnterprises in the zone are required to report their operating and financial information to,\nand are regulated by the center. But they understand that the center will almost never interfere\nwith their internal decisions. The center's officials are mainly from the local government. The\nhigh-tech development zone grew very fast since its inception. From 1997 to 2001, the size of the\nzone increased eight fold, and currently there are 250 firms, with a total of US$ 200 million\nforeign direct investment coming from more than 20 countries and regions, including those from\nTaiwan. Firms are operating in a wide range of industries, from high-tech to clothing, and export\ntheir products to all major markets around the world.\nDuring the early stage of the special zone, investors from Taiwan were willing to commit\ntheir capital to these start-ups and refinance them whenever necessary. Actually the reason that\nmany investors are from Taiwan is no coincidence. Many people in Kunshan have relatives in\nTaiwan and through them the investors obtained the information on the investment opportunities.\nThe Taiwanese investors also came to understand that although there were almost no formal\ninvestor protections, local government officials have an incentive to cooperate with the\ndevelopment of the special zone and creating an economic boom in the local economy. This is the\ncase because a booming economy can greatly enhance the chance of an official being promoted, in\naddition to participating in profit sharing. Another interesting phenomenon during the early stage\nof development was that these investors from Taiwan did not stay in the area as they often do now.\nAs a result, there was virtually no monitoring of the entrepreneurs, and complete separation of\nownership and control.\n44 For more information, refer to this website: http://www.china-hitech.org/hitech/chinese/qiye.asp.\n\nV.4 Discussion\nIn this section we discuss mechanisms supporting the growth of the Private Sector. We\nbelieve the most important reason for the growth is the work of alternative financing and\ngovernance mechanisms. How can these be understood? First, Greif (1989, 1993) argues that\ncertain traders' organizations in the 11th century were able to overcome problems of asymmetric\ninformation and the lack of legal and contract enforcement mechanisms, because they had\ndeveloped institutions based on reputation, implicit contractual relations, and coalitions. Certain\naspects of the growth of these institutions resemble what works in China's Private Sector today, in\nterms of how firms raise funds and contract with investors and business partners. In addition, Greif\n(1994) and Stulz and Williamson (2002) point out the importance of cultural and religious beliefs\non the development of institutions, legal origins, and investor protections. These factors are of\nparticular relevance and importance to China's development of institutions. Without a dominant\nreligion, one can argue that the most important force in shaping China's social values and\ninstitutions is the set of beliefs first developed and formalized by Kong Zi (Confucius). This set of\nbeliefs clearly defines family and social orders, which are very different from the western beliefs\non how legal codes should be formulated.45 Throughout the paper we have presented evidence\nthat reputation and relationships make many financing channels and governance mechanisms work\nin China's Private Sector.\nSecond, there are alternative corporate governance mechanisms that have worked well in\nboth developed and developing countries. First, Allen and Gale (2000b) argue that competition in\nproduct and input markets may be more effective than either the US and UK system based on the\nthreat of takeover, or the Japanese, French, and Germany system based on monitoring, while\nMcMillan (1995, 1997) argues that competition and the entry of non-state firms can facilitate the\n\ntransition to market-based economies for emerging economies. What we see from the success and\nlife cycles of Private Sector firms in WenZhou and other surveyed firms suggest that it is only\nthose firms that have the strongest comparative advantage in an industry (of the area) that survived\nand thrived. Second, Gomes (2000) demonstrates that a managerial reputation effect can replace\nformal governance in an IPO firm. Evidence from the Chinese venture capital industry (Bruton\nand Ahlstrom 2002) supports this view. Third, Burkart, Panunzi, and Shleifer (2002) link the\ndegree of separation of ownership and control to different legal environments, and show that\nfamily-run firms will emerge as the dominant form of ownership structure in countries with weak\nminority shareholder protections, whereas professionally managed firms must be the optimal form\nin countries with strong investor protection. Evidence in Claessens, Djankov and Lang (2000) and\nClaessens et al. (2002) suggests that family-owned firms with very high concentration of\nownership is the norm in many Asian countries outside China and these firms have performed\nwell. Based on our survey evidence, as well as empirical results on the Listed Sector, family firms\nare a norm in both the Listed and Private Sectors in China, consistent with findings in listed firms\nin other Asian countries. Fourth, Allen and Gale (2000a) show that if cooperation among different\nsuppliers of inputs is necessary and all suppliers benefit from the firm doing well then a good\nequilibrium with no external governance is possible, as internal, mutual monitoring can ensure the\noptimal outcome.46 We have shown trade credits to be an important form of financing source for\nfirms during their growth period. Finally, the common goal of sharing high prospective profits\ncan tie local and foreign investors with entrepreneurs and managers to overcome numerous\nobstacles and achieve just that. Under this common goal in a multi-period setting, implicit\ncontractual agreements and reputation can act as enforcement mechanisms to ensure that all\n45 Also see Orts (2001) and Chapters 1, 19, and 20 in Chow (2002).\n46 Allen and Gale (2000b) point out that the success and growth of the non-profit organizations in developed countries\nsuch as the US is a good example of how alternative corporate governance systems can work well.\n\nparties fulfill their roles to make the firm successful. Profit sharing also makes it incentive\ncompatible for officials at various levels to support the growth of the firm.\nThere are other mechanisms supporting the growth of China's Private Sector, as well as\ngrowth of other emerging economies. First, in a series of papers, Djankov et al. (2002, 2003a,\n2003b; DLLS hereafter) examine various aspects of institutions, including regulations of entry and\nlabor, and efficiency of judicial systems across countries. Among the DLLS papers, the entry\nbarrier is probably the most relevant factor for China. DLLS (2002) find that countries with\nheavier (lighter) regulation of entry have higher corruption (more democratic and limited\ngovernments) and larger unofficial economies (counter the regulation which can reduce overall\nefficiency). Thus the regulation of entry benefits politicians/bureaucrats instead of public interests.\nChina is included in the data that includes 85 countries, with much lower barriers to entry\ncompared to countries with similar per capita GDP. The low entry barriers contribute to the\ngrowth of China's Private Sector, as they imply higher competition in the product and input\nmarkets, which we view as one of the most effective governance mechanisms within the Private\nSector. Moreover, in terms of entry barriers, China is once again an \"outlier\" in the DLLS sample,\nconsidering that China is one of least democratic countries, which tend to have high barriers to\nentry.\nThere exist non-standard methods to remove entry barriers that can reconcile the seemingly\ncontradictory facts, based on our survey. First, 16 out of the 17 firms applied license (required)\nbefore the business started, with 50% of them indicating that it takes 2 weeks to 1 month to go\nthrough the procedure and 37.5% say it takes 1-2 months. The main problem for the application of\nlicense seems to be dealing with government bureaucracy. To ease this problem, most of the\nfirms' founders/executives ask the friends of government officials to negotiate on their behalf, or\nthe firms can offer profit sharing to government officials. But these methods are consistent with\n\nour results that alternative mechanisms based on reputation and relationships provide the most\nimportant support for the growth of the Private Sector.\nFinally, there is a strand of literature studying transitional economies, such as Russia,\nChina, and Eastern European countries, from Socialist systems to market systems. It is important\nto point out why China differs from other transitional economies. First, with the exception of\nRussia, China's economy is much larger than other transitional economies. With a small economy,\na country can adjust its legal and financial systems to the strengths of its economy much easier\nthan what a large country can do. The recent economic struggle in Russia proves this point (e.g.,\nShleifer and Treisman 2000). The success of China's Private Sector demonstrates that alternative\nmechanisms can work wonders in large economies.\nSecond, it is probably easier for other countries to adopt drastic reform measures in the\nshort run, as the people are more risk tolerant toward regime shifts. China, under the influence of\nthe Confucius views, is different, in that people hold the belief that fundamental changes in society\nshould be gradual and only after they are proven correct or sensible. Moreover, any such change\nshould not shake the foundations of the society based on existing beliefs. Accordingly, China\nadopted a gradual, \"dual track\" path in its economic reform, in that the continued enforcement of\nthe existing planning system goes alongside with the fast-paced development of financial markets,\nas compared to the \"big bang\" approach taken by other countries. The dual track system is\nequivalent to lump-sum transfers from the market sector to the planning sector to achieve a Pareto\nimprovement of the entire society, while its non-standard institutions suit this transition period\nbecause they provide incentives for economic agents to innovate and to compete and provide\nenough benefits to those in power so that they do not preclude the reform process (e.g., Lau et al.\n2000, Qian 1999).\n\nThird, the role played by the government during reform process is very different in China\nthan in most other transition economies, in particular, Russia (e.g., Blanchard and Shleifer 2001).\nIn a broader context, LLSV (1999) find that governments in countries with French laws or\nsocialist laws have lower quality (in terms of supporting economic growth) than those with\ncommon laws and richer countries. But clearly China is a counterexample to LLSV's argument on\ngovernment: while the Chinese Communist Party largely remains autocratic, government officials,\nespecially those in the most developed areas (e.g., Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces), played an\nactive supporting role in promoting the growth of Private Sector. This is different from the\n\"grabbing hand\" role played by government officials in some other countries. The reason for this\nsupporting role is three fold. First, as Li (1998) points out, starting in the early 1980s, the central\ngovernment implemented a mandatory retirement age for almost all bureaucrats at various levels,\nwhich made the officials younger and more familiar with capitalist ideas. In Russia, officials from\nthe old regime were entrenched and able to extract rents from the new economy without any\ncontribution. Secondly, during early stages of China's reform, TVEs, in which local governments\nare partial owners, provided the most important source of growth in the Private Sector. The\nenormous success of TVEs and the promotion of the associated officials provided examples and\nincentives to other officials to follow suit. Thirdly, as discussed above, profit sharing with firms in\na multi-period setting also makes it incentive compatible for officials at various levels to support\nthe growth of the firm.\nVI. Concluding Remarks\nIn this paper we examine and compare China's formal systems of law and finance and the\nco-existing, alternative system of institutions and mechanisms, and the relation between the\ndevelopment of these systems and China's overall economic growth. With one of the largest and\n\nfastest growing economies in the world, China differs from most of the countries studied in the\nlaw, institutions, finance, and growth literature, and is an important counterexample to the findings\nin the existing literature. Its legal and financial systems as well as institutions are all under-\ndeveloped, but its economy has been growing at a very fast rate. More importantly, the growth in\nthe Private Sector, where applicable legal and financial mechanisms are much poorer than those in\nthe State and Listed Sectors, is much faster than that of the other sectors. We believe that the\nsystem of alternative mechanisms and institutions plays an important role in supporting the growth\nin the Private Sector, and they are excellent substitutes for standard corporate governance\nmechanisms and financing channels.\nGoing forward, our results pose an important question for both researchers and policy\nmakers: should China also transform the Private Sector toward the \"standard form\" like it has been\ndoing for the State Sector? Given the success of the Private Sector and the deficiency in the State\nand Listed Sectors, we believe that much more research is required, in order to better understand\nhow alternative mechanisms work where standard mechanisms are not available or not suitable.\nOur work also has general implications for the literature on law, institutions, finance, and growth:\nthere are important factors that are not well understood. Adopting results obtained from studying\ndeveloped countries to the development of emerging countries can be misleading and\ncounterproductive. We find that these substitutes have worked well in China, and similar\nsubstitutes based on relationship and reputation may have also worked well in other economies\nincluding developed economies. Therefore, a better understanding of how these non-standard\nmechanisms work to promote growth can shed light on alternative development paths that can\nbenefit many other countries.\n\nAppendix A: Brief Descriptions of All the Variables and Their Sources\nA.1.

Definitions on different types of firms in China (used in Tables 5b and Figures 1-3)\n1. State-owned Enterprises: Non-corporation economic units where the entire assets are owned by the state\nand which have registered in accordance with the \"regulation of the People's Republic of China on the\nManagement of Registration of Corporate Enterprises.\" Excluded from this category are the sole state funded\ncorporations in the limited liability corporation.\nNote: The government is the de facto owner, and they choose managers to run the firm. Even though these\nfirms do enter the credit plan, but this process is constructed and enforced by state banks, which are also\nunder the control of the government.\n2. Collective-Owned Enterprises: Economic units where the assets are owned collectively and which have\nregistered in accordance with the \"Regulation of the People's Republic of China on the management of\nregistration of corporate Enterprise.\nNote: Local government can be regarded as the agent of central government. Therefore, any firm owned by\nlocal government is also owned by central government. Collective ownership here means the community in\nthe city or rural area joins the ownership.\n3. Township-village Enterprises (TVEs): Enterprises and economic units located in rural areas, collectively-\nowned or with most of investment from residents in these rural areas. An enterprise in a rural area is legally\nregistered as a TVE where rural communities or residents invest more than 50% of the firm's total assets or\nact as the control owners in the operation of enterprise.\nNote: There can be firms that are both collectively-owned and TVEs, as long as they are in the rural areas and\nhave more than 50% of total assets coming from residents from the same rural area/county. The difference is\nthat TVEs are all located in rural areas while collectively-owned firms can be in cities; while TVEs can be\nsolely owned by residents of that rural area and the local government has no ownership nor control over the\nfirm.\n4. Jointly-owned firms: Economic Units established by two or more corporate enterprises or institutions of\nthe same or different ownership, through joint investment on the basis of equality, voluntary participation and\nmutual benefits. They include state joint ownership enterprises, collective joint ownership enterprises, joint\nstate-collective enterprise, and other joint ownership.\nNote: Enterprise involved with foreign investment/ownership is not in this category. They are in the Category\nof \"Enterprise with Foreign investment, which has 3 different types.\n5. Share-holding Corporations Ltd: Economic units registered in accordance with the \"Regulation of the\nPeople's Republic of China on the management of Corporations\", with total registered capitals divided into\nequal shares and raised through issuing stocks. Each investor bears limited liability to the corporation\ndepending on the holding of shares, and the corporation bears liability to its debt to the maximum of its total\nassets.\nNote: The above is essentially the same definition of US public companies, but these Chinese companies\nhave non-tradable shares that are the by-product of the reforming process.\n\nAppendix B Empirical Tests on Listed Firms in China and Other Countries\nData: We have firm level accounting and security market data for all the listed firms in China (panel data set of 1174\nfirms, 1992-2000 period, total of 7377 observations). We compare these Chinese firms with those studied in LLSV\n(2000, 2002; 4103 firms from 33 countries, 1989-1994 period). We do not have detailed firm level data for LLSV\nsamples, but we do have: 1) the cross-sectional summary statistics by country; 2) the regression results across\ncountries. We examine dividend policy and firm valuations, and our empirical models and results are presented below.\nMethod 1: \"Synthetic firm\" approach:\nStep1: Using the summary statistics from LLSV samples, we create a \"synthetic firm\" for each of the 33 countries.\nFor this synthetic firm, each firm characteristic is equal to the median of the same variable across all the firms in that\ncountry. Following the same procedure, a synthetic firm is also created for China based on the information of 1100+\nfirms.\nStep2: Three OLS regressions are run on the 33 (LLSV countries) \"synthetic\" observations. The dependent variables\nin these tests are: 1) dividend/earnings ratio, 2) dividend/sales ratio, and 3) Tobin's q (measured by market to book\nassets ratio). The independent variables are the same ones used in LLSV (2000, 2002). Based on the results from each\nof the 3 regressions, we then conduct an out-of-sample prediction for China using the estimated coefficients and\nvariances.\nStep3: Compare the \"true\" (observed) firm characteristics of the Chinese \"synthetic\" firm to those predicted values\nfrom Step 2, and see whether the true value falls in the boundaries of predicted values.\nThe following table presents the coefficients estimates, t ratios, prediction, and boundaries from the regression on 33\nsynthetic firms, and empirical value from Chinese firms in sample.\ny: Div/Earn\ny: Div/Sales\ny: Tobin's q\nintercept\n42.44\n1.30\nintercept\n-0.58\n(3.79*)\n(0.64)\n(-0.58 )\nCivil law dummy\n3.42\n(0.33)\n-1.06\n(-0.56 )\nGrowth in sales\n0.00\n(0.17)\nLow protection\n-9.09\n1.57\nCommon law\n0.30\n(-0.91 )\n(0.86)\n(0.30)\nGS\n0.47\n(0.72)\n0.16\n(1.36)\nAnti-director rights\n0.65\n(1.81*)\nGS*civil law\n-1.12\n0.00\nCF rights\n5.87\n(-1.18 )\n(0.00)\n(1.89*)\nGS*Low Protection\n0.86\n(0.89)\n-0.20\n(-1.13 )\nCF rights*common Law\n-0.52\n(-0.15)\nDiv tax advantage\n-10.54\n0.25\nCF rights*anti-director\n-2.12\n(-0.85 )\n(0.11)\n(-1.78* )\nR square\n# of observations\n0.16\n0.09\nR square\n# of observations\n0.39\nPredicted values for China\n57.14 ~161.07\n- 8.82\nPredicted values for China\n0.57\n(lower and upper bounds)\n~10.19\n(lower and upper bounds)\n~ 1.86\nObserved ratio from China\n30.23\n2.35\nObserved ratio for China\n1.22\nMethod 2: \"Alpha\" approach\nUtilizing the alpha notation from assets pricing models, we want to see how much of the variations in the dependent\nvariables are NOT explained by the independent variables. There are two versions of this model: restricted and\nunrestricted, depending on whether we restrict the coefficients on each independent variable to be the same for\nChinese firms and for firms in other countries.\nMethod 2 - Restricted Model\nStep1: For Chinese firms, we run regressions according to: y = alpha(China) + gamma*Z + e, where y is the actual\nvalue of Tobin's q, or dividend payout ratio. Z is a vector of firm characteristics.\n\nStep2: Adjusted alpha (China) = Alpha (China from regression) - beta(LLSV)⋅X(China). Then compare the adjusted\nAlpha (China) with Alpha (LLSV samples).\nMethod 2: Unrestricted Model\nStep1: Alpha (China) = mean (yi-gamma(LLSV)*Z(China))\nStep2: The same as the step 2 in Restricted Model above.\nThe following table presents the alpha for LLSV sample firms, Alpha for Chinese firms, and the discrepancy.\n\nDividend/Earnings\nDividend/Sales\nTobin'q\nAlpha in LLSV\n44.9493\n1.8907\n1.1559\nAlphas for Chinese firms: Unrestricted Model\nRestricted Model\n11.5033\n2.5876\n0.5151*\nUnrestricted Model\n11.8270\n1.1490\n0.5831\nAdjusted alphas for Chinese Firms: Restricted Model\nRestricted Model\n14.5388\n0.8131\n0.2946\nUnrestricted Model\n14.8626\n-0.6255\n0.2582\nDiscrepancy\nRestricted Model\n30.4105\n1.0776\n0.8613\nUnrestricted Model\n30.0804\n2.5162\n0.6898\nNote: * denote the significance at 1% level. The other two alphas in the restricted model for China are not significant.\nMethod 3: Firm level Out-of-sample predictions:\nWe also perform firm level out-of-sample predictions, based on the regression results from LLSV (2000, 2002). The\nresults are similar to the above two methods. Method 3 can actually be proven to be mathematically identical to the\nunrestricted model in Method 2, and thus the details are omitted here.\nSummary of Results:\n1) The out-of-sample prediction for Dividend / Earning is dramatically different from empirical observed value (lower\nthan the low boundary).\n2) The observed Dividend /sales, and Tobin's q ratios locate between predicted boundaries.\n3) The discrepancy of unexplained portion of the dependent variables is big for Dividend/Earnings, but small for\ndividend/Sales, and Tobin's q.\n(The average ratios themselves are not dramatically different between China and other countries. 30.23(China,\ndividend/earnings) vs. 32.61, 2.35 vs. 1.99, and 1.21 vs. 1.38.)\nConclusion: We can conclude that the independent variables proposed in previous studies, do not explain the firm\nbehaviors exactly the same for Chinese firms as for firms in other countries. However, we can not specify which\nvariables, hence what mechanism is different, and how much difference exactly is there.\n\nReferences:\n1.

      "content": "Property Rights in Context: Privatization's Legacy for Corporate Legality in\nPoland and Russia\n\nPrepared for the Studies in Comparative International Development symposium on\ninstitutions and evolution.\n\nDavid M. Woodruff\n\nThird draft, August 14, 2003\n\nMore than a decade after the collapse of state socialism in the East Bloc, the\nregion displays many striking and intriguing contrasts in national trajectories. This\npaper focuses on one such contrast: the remarkable distinctions between Poland and\nRussia in the area of corporate governance. In the 1990's Russia's corporate\ngovernance became notoriously conflictual. In any number of privatized firms,\nmanagement refused to share power and profits with shareholders, sometimes via\nflouting the law, at other times by simply manipulating it. Legal experts asked \"what\nwent wrong\" and sought \"corporate governance lessons from Russian enterprise\nfiascoes.\"1 The state of corporate legality in Poland, by contrast, drew far more\nflattering academic depictions.2 Practitioners shared academics' impressions. Surveys\nby the EBRD, as well as other systematic cross-country comparisons, generally rated\nPoland far above Russia in terms of the effectiveness of its commercial and corporate\nlaw.3 The enormous, almost laughable gap in what constituted major corporate\ngovernance scandals in each country is a telling indicator of the same divergence. In\nPoland, one large firm set off a firestorm of investor criticism for failing to disclose it\nhad given another firm an option to buy shares in an attractive telecom assets at a low\nprice.4 A firm in which this was the most serious governance problem would have been\na paragon of good corporate behavior in the Russian market of the 1990's. For many\nRussian outsider shareholders, discussing the quality of disclosure would have been a\n\n1 Black, Kraakman, and Tarassova 2000; Fox and Heller 2000.\n2 For instance, Glaeser, Johnson, and Shleifer 2001\n3 Pistor, Raiser, and Gelfer 2000.\n4 Piotrowicz 1998.\n\nluxury: they were more concerned whether they would in fact be allowed to attend\nshareholders' meetings.5\nThese contrasts, I argue below, resulted from the way privatization structured\nrelations among shareholders in privatized firms, and relations between these\nshareholders and stakeholders in the privatized firms (i.e., managers, employees,\nsuppliers, and customers).6 In Russia, privatization was carried out in a way that\nstrongly discouraged negotiation both among stakeholders and among potential\nshareholders of the corporations created from them. Division of property thus became\na zero-sum game, with large rewards for displacing other claimants. These large\nrewards led to frequent contestation of the property rights granted by corporate shares.\nIn Poland, by contrast, privatization and the transition to corporate form generally could\noccur only after potential shareholders and stakeholders had reached a bargained\nagreement. The allocation of property rights was part and parcel of a larger\naccommodation about the future of the firm--a positive-sum game, and one in which\ncontesting property rights would risk the gains from cooperation.7 Thus, in Poland the\nform of privatization ensured that those in a position to challenge shareholders'\n\n5 Black, Kraakman, and Tarassova 2000, 1771; Sprenger 2000.\n6 For a different perspective on how privatization strategies in the two countries\naffected property rights, see Goldman 1999.\n7 This argument is influenced especially by Spicer, Kogut, and McDermott 2000;\nKogut and Spicer 2002; {McDermott, 2004 #1232}; and Ellerman 2001. Polish\nprivatization involved a number of variants capable of encompassing the specifics of\nthese accommodations. unlike Russia which practiced something very much like\n\"institutional monoculture\" in its privatization format. On \"institutional monoculture\"\nsee Evans' contribution to this symposium. Compare also the discussion of the\ndifficulties of formalizing property rights in Scott 1998.\n\nproperty rights were embedded in relationships that encouraged them not to do so.8 In\nRussia, the form of privatization made such accommodations impossible, and set the\nstage for intense and long-running struggles over property rights.9\nThus, this article offers contrasts in how privatization embedded property rights\nas an answer to the empirical puzzle of contrasting corporate governance experiences\nin Poland and Russia. The theoretical significance of this argument is the evidence it\nprovides for an \"economic sociology of law\" (ESOL) approach to the legal grounding of\nproperty rights. As Richard Swedberg notes, \"From a sociological perspective it is ...\nobvious that many factors other than the law determine why people engage in the\nbehavior prescribed by the law. The extent to which it is the law, rather than some\nother factor that determines the behavior in question, has therefore to be decided in\neach particular case.\"10 The ESOL resonates with several other schools of thought that\nlikewise direct attention to the interests, resources, and options that affect actors'\ndecisions to invoke, obey, or manipulate law. Thus one might also term this an \"old\ninstitutional economics,\" \"legal realist,\" or \"critical legal studies\" approach to law.11\n\n8 I use \"embedded\" in the sense of Granovetter 1985 and Somers 1993.\n9 There is something of a consensus linking conflictual Russian corporate\ngovernance to the form of privatization. Black, Kraakman, and Tarassova 2000; Fox\nand Heller 2000; Pistor 1997; Shleifer and Treisman 2000; Spicer, Kogut, and\nMcDermott 2000. Where the present article differs is in its focus on identifying a\nconfiguration of factors that made property rights subject to contention, rather than\npresuming Russian managers' propensity to steal as a given inevitably requiring\nenforcement.\n10 Swedberg 2003, 8.\n11 For a classic text of the \"old institutional economics\" that makes these points\nsee Commons 1957. \"Old institutional economics\" was closely allied with the school of\n\"legal realism\" within studies of the law Fried 1998, and the arguments of both schools\nhave more recently been taken up in the Critical Legal Studies movement Kennedy\n\nScholars in these traditions recognize that law operates in a dual context: in a context\nof legal facts (e.g,, who owns what) and of contextual factors (what other relations,\noptions, and interests owners have).12 For instance, the attitude of managers to\nshareholders' rights will depend not only on the laws governing these rights, but also on\nthe legal facts of stock ownership and such sociological factors as where the firm\nintends to acquire capital or with whom it needs to cooperate.13 These points about the\nimportance of context enable a thoroughgoing challenge to various new-institutionalist\narguments that link security of property rights primarily to the commitment and\ncapacity of state bodies to enforce them, to the normative legitimacy of the law, or to\ncoordination equilibria in a game-theoretic framework. The ESOL argument also\nenables a clarification of the politics of corporate property rights that strengthens the\ncase made by historical institutionalists for an understanding of institutions as\nimperfectly self-contained processes unfolding over time.14\nHowever, discussion of implications for politics and other institutionalist\napproaches will be postponed to the conclusion. The body of the paper first explicates\non a general level how the intersection of legal facts, contextual factors, and laws on\nthe books shapes the practical effects of law. I also argue that certain combinations of\nthese factors are unstable even given powerful enforcement commitments, prompting\n\n1993. For Swedberg's approach, which draws parallel ideas from Weber, see Swedberg\n2003.\n12 Commons 1957, 65-67.\n13 Rapaczynski 1996. Or, in another example, as Granovetter notes, firms may\ndecline to enforce contracts against partners whose future cooperation they need\nGranovetter 1985.\n14 Thelen 1999, 383-384.\n\nevolution in legal facts or contextual factors. In the second section, I describe the\nprivatization experiences in the two cases, arguing that unlike Poland's privatization,\nRussia's established an unsustainable combination of stock ownership patterns (legal\nfacts), interests of and relations between shareholders (contextual facts), and corporate\nlaws.\nThe third section demonstrates that this unsustainable combination promoted\nenormous dynamism and conflict in Russian corporate governance. The contentious\nuse of \"loopholes\" designed to force the transfer of property rights and alter the legal\nfacts had a central role in these conflicts. In Poland, by contrast, the persisting legacy\nof privatization created far less conflict and corporate property transfers took the more\nfamiliar form of voluntary purchase and sale. The conclusion returns to the theoretical\nimplications of these contrasting developments. In particular, it discusses how\nunderstanding the context of the legal facts of property changes one's view of the\npolitics surrounding property rights.\nI. Contextualizing Property Rights: Legal Facts, Sociological\nFacts, and Laws\nAdopt good laws, and enforce them: such, in a nutshell, is the program of what\nhas been termed the \"new\" law-and-development movement, which promotes the\nstrengthening of legal institutions as a path to growth.15 This movement reprises\narguments dating at least to the 18th century that link stability of property rights to\ninvestment and thence to growth. More recent support for such this position comes\n\nfrom the huge literature in the New Institutional Economics, corporate governance, and\nrelated fields. Characteristic of this approach is an emphasis on enforcement.\nEnforcement should work to cow the shifty, and thereby embolden the thrifty, who\ninvest and trade. Unpunished malfeasance should have the opposite effects.16 Thus,\nstate capacity to ensure impartial and consistent enforcement of commercial law that\nunderpins the predictability businesses need to invest and promote growth.\nThese arguments, I argue in this section, may be logically impeccable but they\nare sociologically naive. The emphasis on enforcement obscures the crucial question of\nhow hard the state has to work to ensure law-consistent action in the realm of property\nrights. Are the laws securing property ones people behave consistently with for reasons\nof their own, or is the threat of enforcement necessary? In discussions in many areas\nof legal policy, such as those surrounding drug prohibition, this question is manifestly\ncentral, and oft-posed. But it has had little impact on discussions of property rights. I\nargue that when property laws are flouted, or subverted, this does not necessarily imply\na \"weak state;\" it may merely imply an effort to strike an unsustainable balance\nbetween legal facts, contextual factors, and the laws on the books.\nThe starting point for an effort to move beyond an exclusive emphasis on\nenforcement is Wittgenstein's demonstration that any action is consistent with an\narbitrarily large number of rules. For instance, in a stopping at a red light I might be\n\n15 Rose 1998. Cf. Messick 1999; Upham 2002. On the older law-and-\ndevelopment movement, which was closely linked to modernization theory, see\nTamanaha 1995.\n16 For an example pertaining to Russian corporate governance, see Fox and\nHeller 2000, 1725.\n\nobeying any of the following rules: (1) always stop at red lights; (2) stop at red lights\nexcept when I'm running late; (3) stop at red lights except on January 1st, 2010; (4)\nstop at red lights when it would be dangerous not to; and so on and so forth.17 For\nsocial scientists this argument contains an important lesson about the rules set out in\nlaw: actions consistent with a law need not be motivated by that law--by respect for its\nprovisions or fear of those charged with enforcing it.18 For instance, when I choose to\nstop at a red light at a busy intersection, the desire to avoid a crash might loom larger\nin my considerations than the fear of a traffic fine. Just because I am acting\nconsistently with a legal rule does not mean the law's authority and sanctions played\nany part in my decision. Thus, one needs to distinguish the broad category of law-\nconsistent action, motivated by anything whatsoever, from its subset, the narrower\ncategory of law-motivated action, motivated by the law's authority or sanctions. I refer\nto the multiple possible motivations underlying law-abiding action as the potential\nembeddedness of law.19\nThe notion of the potential embeddedness of law relativizes the significance of\nenforcement capacity by emphasizing that fear of legal punishment is only one of the\n\n17 Kripke 1982.\n18 For an important discussion of the multiple reasons rules are invoked, on an\nexample of traditional rather than legal rules, see Bourdieu 1977, 33-52. See also\nSwedberg 2003, 8. Scholars sometimes argue that people's beliefs about the normative\nvalidity of law influence laws effectiveness (North 1990, 6; Cooter 1997). However, this\nmodification does nothing to address the distinction between law-consistent and law-\nabiding behavior. Law is still obeyed because it's the law. Indeed, in Cooter's game-\ntheoretic analysis, normative commitment to the law is modeled as an increase in the\npayoff to obeying it, which is structurally equivalent to an increase in the cost of\nenforcement. Thus, there is no contextual \"embeddedness\" of law-consistent behavior.\n19 Woodruff 2000, 442. Compare Granovetter 1985; Somers 1993.\n\nmotives that can inspire behavior consistent with law. Many businesspeople refrain\nfrom illegal deceit, as a number of scholars have noted, because they desire to reap the\nrewards of a reputation for fair dealing.20 More generally, there may be extra-legal\ncosts that deter violations of the law. By the same token, the magnitude of the gains\navailable from violating the law are an obvious stimulation to violate it.21 Even a small\nchance of mild punishment might deter a violation that yields little benefit. This point is\nobvious enough when one compares the prevalence of violation of two different laws in\nthe same jurisdiction. That drivers will exceed the speed limit more readily than they\nwill drive on the wrong side of the road does not primarily reflect the greater severity\nand probability of legal punishment for the latter. The concept of \"state capacity to\ndeter violation of the traffic laws,\" which superficially seems extremely specific, is\nactually too general to capture the reasons people obey or violate particular traffic laws.\nTo speak of a general state capacity to enforce contracts and defend property,\nwithout considering the value and context of the rights the state is protecting, is just as\nsenseless as speaking of a state capacity to deter violations of the traffic laws. The\nargument about how situational incentives (costs and benefits of violating the law in\nsome specific instance) contribute to law-compatible action is expressed in Figure 1.\nFigure 1\n\n20 Klein 1997 includes many relevant papers. However, it is still an empirical\nquestions when reputational concerns mandate law-abiding behavior and when they do\nnot. See Sinyagina-Woodruff 2003.\n21 Swedberg 2003, 8, 11. This is a problem with game-theoretic accounts of law-\nconforming behavior, which seem invariably to model the potential material payoffs to\nviolating the law as the same in all circumstances. See, for instance, Cooter 1997.\n\nBenefits and (non-legal) costs of\nviolating the law\nSeverity and probability of\nenforcement\n→\nPrevalence of law-compatible\nbehavior\n\nTraffic laws, however, are a poor metaphor for the laws securing property rights.\nProperty rights are rights to invoke the state's backing to compel people to behave in\ncertain ways: to pay debts, to allow shareholders to participate in the governance of a\ncorporation, to refrain from trespass, etc. One can violate a traffic law all by oneself,\non a deserted road; but property rights are claims people assert against one another.\nThus, the relevant decision is whether to contest property rights claimed by someone\nelse, either via litigation or simply by taking actions that negate these claimed rights. It\nis the chance of having one's way in such a contestation, through prevailing in court or\nsimply by the other side conceding the rights in question, that must be weighed against\ncosts and benefits (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2\nBenefits and costs of contesting\nproperty rights\nProbability that will contestation will\nface costly opposition\nProbability of prevailing in court\n→\nSecurity of property rights\n(prevalence of contestation)\n\nProbability and severity of legal\nenforcement against contestation\n\nA simple state-capacity argument for the prevalence of secure, which is to say\nuncontested, property rights focuses on laws, courts and enforcement: With clear laws\napplied evenhandedly and without corruption, those mulling illegitimate contestations\nwill not embark on them, especially if unsuccessful contestations are punished. Again,\nthis superficially plausible argument, presented in the unshaded cells, ignores the value\nof the property rights that the state is seeking to protect (which affects the issues\nshown in the shaded cells). Just as law-compatible action stems from the joint effect of\nenforcement and extra-enforcement considerations, the failure to contest property\nrights (allowing them to be secure) stems from the joint effect of legal and extra-legal\nconsiderations. Were I to form a corporation tomorrow to capitalize on the commercial\nimplications of my social scientific research, I doubtless could be sure that no one\nwould contest my ownership of this corporation, even if the legal system's ability to\ndefend property was notoriously weak: why steal something of such risible value?\nEstablishing that the security of claimed property rights (i.e., how broadly they\nare accepted) is a product of situational considerations still leaves open the question of\nhow best to describe these situational considerations. As suggested earlier, these are\nusefully divided into three parts: laws on the books, legal facts, and contextual factors.\nThe latter two categories require some explication. By legal facts I mean the set of\nfacts about the world relevant to the implementation of laws. For instance, while the\n\nlaw might state that contracts will be enforced, that any two particular parties had\nsigned a contract with particular provisions would be a legal fact. Contextual factors\nare those that shape the costs and benefits of accepting a given set of legal facts and\ntheir law-driven consequences in a particular context. These costs and benefits will\nhave multiple sources. Some are purely sociological: what relationships will be hurt or\nhelped by accepting or challenging particular claims of property rights?22 Some are\ntransparently material: what are the costs of contesting claimed property rights, and\nwhat are the potential payoffs?23 Others are determined by situational bargaining\npower: are there alternatives to remaining exposed to the power of others' property\nrights, and how attractive are these alternatives?24\nA single legal provision can intersect with any number of configurations of legal\nfacts and contextual factors. The laws says debts must be repaid, but one creditor\nmight take a harsh line with deadbeat debtors due to pressing obligations, where\nanother will forbear in expectation of an economic upturn. To take an example closer\nto present concerns, many have argued that managers who hold stock themselves will\nbe more respectful of shareholder property rights. In short, when one observes that\nproperty rights are rarely challenged, this is not necessarily testimony to the authority\nof the law and the impartiality and power of its enforcers. It could equally reflect a\nconfiguration of legal facts and contextual factors that make challenging property rights\nunattractive. By the same token, prevalent challenges to property rights do not\n\n22 Granovetter 1985.\n23 Cf. Swedberg 2003, 2, 8.\n\nnecessarily reflect corrupt and ineffectual authorities defending illegitimate laws: a\npriori, there is no reason not to seek the explanation in a lack of property-supporting\nembedded relationships or in high payoffs to successfully contesting property rights.\nIndeed, as I will argue below, just these factors explained the conflicts surrounding\nRussian corporate governance over the last decade, as well as their dynamism.\nAn implication: paths of change and loci of conflict\nBefore turning to the case material, it is helpful to explore the implications of the\nargument that law-consistent action derives from a configuration of legal and situational\nfactors for institutional change. When a table wobbles, one can stabilize it by making\none leg longer or the other three shorter. Likewise, if it is a configuration of elements\nthat renders property rights unstable, there should be multiple paths to stability.\nChange in the laws and their enforcement is only one possible path--and for actors\npursuing their advantage in local contexts, sometimes a rather distant one. This is\nespecially so in a civil-law system like Russia's, where courts have limited authority to\nextend or modify laws through precedents, making rules harder to change. By\ncontrast, changes in legal facts or contextual factors do not require moving the massive\nmachinery of the nation-state.25\nHighlighting struggles over the definition of legal facts as a route to institutional\nchange is one of the ways that an economic sociology of law improves on an\n\n24 This last point is especially central to the OIE-Legal Realist-Critical Legal\nStudies line of thinking Commons 1957, 65; Hale 1952; Kennedy 1993, 87.\n25 Kennedy 1993, 93 notes that legal tactics \"are constantly invented by smart\npeople looking for ways to modify the balance of power without a change in the\nintractable, large, general determinants of strength.\"\n\nenforcement-centered view of property rights. When actors pursue their interests\nthrough struggle over the definition of the legal facts, legal rules can become a factor of\nuncertainty rather than certainty. This so because actors will canvass the massive body\nof the law seeking rules that give the substantive changes in the legal facts they need,\nwhatever the implicit or explicit reasoning behind the rule. A brief exposition of this\nargument, adapted from Karl Llewellyn (a central figure in legal realism), illustrates the\nkinds of frictions likely to arise when actors find powerful material or contextual reasons\nto challenge legal facts.26\nLlewellyn argues that statutes implicitly or explicitly depict \"situation-types\"\ninvolving a specification of relevant actors and their motives.27 In considering whether\na given situation ought to be brought under a legal provision, judges weigh how\nadequately the provision depicts the motivations of the actors involved. When the\nmotivations implied in legislation fail to match those operative in practice, judges often\nexperience the outcome of applying the provision as unjust. In Weberian terms, formal\nrationality gives an unwelcome substantive result; Llewellyn describes this as a violation\nof the \"fireside equities,\" i.e., of the judge's intuition for what a fair decision would be.28\nLlewellyn's discussion of the abuse of legal remedies for failure of a shipment of\ngoods to conform to specification provides an example. The situation-type (recall that\nthis refers to relevant actors and their motivations for invoking a law) is one where a\n\n26 The account that follows is thoroughly influenced by Stinchcombe 2001, 76-\n99, which gives a pellucid reading of Llewellyn 1960.\n27 I have not been able to locate a precise definition of situation-type in\nLlewellyn; my definition as \"actors and motives\" is abstracted from his uses of the term\non 212, 271-272, 426-428 and elsewhere.\n\nbuyer and a seller have agreed to a transaction where the seller undertakes to deliver\ngoods of a specified quality and the buyer agrees to pay a definite price. The law\nmakes provision for the buyer to refuse delivery when the goods are not as promised.\nRefusal of delivery is allowed in order that buyers may be confident they will get what\nthey pay for. However, courts saw a number of cases in which buyers chose to claim\nthat goods did not conform to quality for a different reason: the price of the goods in\nquestion had gone down. Thus, actors reacted to a change in contextual factors (the\nprice of goods) by contesting legal facts (the quality of the goods).\nBecause the law offered no straightforward way to disallow non-acceptance of\ngoods on such motivations, judges sought other, technical grounds to disallow them (in\nLlewellyn's phrasing, judges were \"trump[ing] the sharper's ace\" by invoking a legal\nrule irrelevant to their real concerns, just as the buyers were).29 Fireside equities were\ndriving decisions. As an appeals-court judge noted, \"it would seem at least possible\nthat [the decisions in lower courts on such a case] were influenced not a little by their\nnatural desire to prevent purchasers on a rapidly falling market from escaping from a\nbad bargain, by taking advantage of a variation from the terms for which they in fact\ncared nothing.\"30\nThis example illustrates nicely how when applying a legal rule to a situation, one\nis also offering a depiction of the motivations of the parties that may or may not be\naccurate. When a rule is invoked for reasons other than the motivations implicitly or\n\n28 Llewellyn 1960, 274.\n29 Llewellyn 1960, 123.\n30 Quoted in Llewellyn 1960, 123n158.\n\nexplicitly embodied in it, we may term the rule a \"loophole\" or \"technicality.\" In the\nsort of cases just discussed, buyers were exploiting non-conformance to the agreed\nterms as a loophole to avoid their agreed-upon obligations. Judges sought other\nloopholes to force them to uphold these obligations.31 The search for loopholes\nundermines the predictability of laws: because this search may conceivably involve a\nhuge body of rules, it becomes difficult to predict which rules will be relevant.\nLegal development does not necessarily get bogged down in an endless hunt for\nrules that adventitiously justify particular substantive outcomes in particular cases.\nWhen situations repeat, sometimes it is possible to find, or create, a single rule that\nconsistently gives the desired substantive outcome in a situation-type, rather than just\na particular case. Llewellyn even asserts that situation-types generally imply some\n\"immanent law\" or \"singing rule\" with these features, a rule which talented judges can\nuncover.32 Such loophole-closing does increase legal certainty, by fitting rules to the\ncircumstances in which they are invoked, and producing substantive results that accord\nwith most judges' sense of the fireside equities. As Stinchcombe's reading suggests, an\nindicator that legal certainty (or \"reasonable regularity,\" the phrase Llewellyn prefers)\nhas been achieved is that \"hard cases\" stop reaching the stage of appeals, since what\n\n31 Compare Llewellyn 1960, 274 on \"bad law.\"\n32 Llewellyn 1960, 122. This process requires that judges have substantial\nflexibility in deducing decisions from extant law. That they do is a key legal realist\nargument; Llewellyn 1960, 129, cf. 75-76 argues that judges regularly have a \"choice\namong [a] plethora of correct doctrinal possibilities.\"\n\ngenerates appeals are precisely those cases in which the desire of judges for a\nsubstantive outcome has to be backed up by vulnerable legal reasoning.33\nIn the example considered above, Llewellyn does not say how, or whether,\njudges came up with a rule that made it clear that buyers could not use nonconforming\ngoods as an excuse to return to the market for a better price, but this would have been\nthe final stage in his process. Stinchcombe terms the process of forging rules that give\nsubstantively desirable results in classes of cases a \"trajectory of improvement.\" The\nintellectual possibility for such a trajectory--leaving aside all practical matters--depends\non the recognizing that particular loopholes are being invoked on similar motivations in\nsimilar situations. Thus, stability in the workings of a legal rule depends on regularity in\nthe sort of situation in which it is applied, regularity in terms of the motivations of the\nparties. By itself a rule on what allows a buyer to reject a seller's shipment as not up to\nsnuff does not create predictability for the seller--if the market situation determines\nhow intensively the buyer will look for grounds for rejection, or the kinds of remedies\nthe buyer will seek. How much certainty the rule gives depends on how stable the\nmarket situation is, and how well the law is able to recognize and sanction efforts to\nexploit a technicality for commercial advantage. In some circumstances--such as\npurchases of unique goods not elsewhere available--the rule's predictability might well\nbe completely adequate.\nThus, the trajectory of improvement argument reflects the ESOL approach by\nrecognizing the interplay between legal facts and contextual factors in determining the\n\n33 Stinchcombe 2001, 80, 95.\n\nsignificance and effectiveness of legal rules. The need for a trajectory of improvement\nstems from the fact that enforcement of rules uncovered in a search for loopholes and\ntechnicalities may dec ease the predictability of law and thereby the security of property\nrights. This facially paradoxical conclusion illustrates how radically the ESOL approach\nenforcement-centered, state capacity view. One cannot focus solely on the resources\nfor law enforcement when actors are actively seeking to turn the law against itself. In\nother words, law can not only be violated: it can also be made vague.\nr\n\n34 The Llewellyn-\nStinchcombe argument thus provides a useful indicator for distinguishing between\ncorporate governance conflict traceable primarily to weak enforcement and that\nstemming primarily from an unsustainable configuration of legal and contextual factors.\nIn the latter case, much of the conflict ought to center around the use of loopholes, and\ndevelopment will take not the form of improvement in enforcement, but of\nmodifications in rules. Below, I demonstrate that corporate governance practice in\nRussia had these features. First, though, I turn to the privatization policies that gave\nrise to them.\nPrivatization in Poland and Russia\nIf we take the overwhelmingly shared impression that legal certainty of\nshareholder rights in Poland has been far greater than that in Russia as accurate, the\nforgoing suggests we look to the different contexts in which shareholder property rights\n\n34 This in and of itself is a challenge to any game-theoretic understanding of law\n(e.g. Cooter 1997), which requires that actions be definitively legal or illegal.\n\nwere exercised to explain why.35 The privatization programs in Russia and Poland\n\"embedded\" the corporate law governing privatized enterprises differently, an outcome\nthat reflects distinctions in how these programs reacted to the existing relational\ncontext of state-owned enterprises. The programs had different ways of addressing the\ninterests of stakeholders: those in existing, ongoing relationships to the enterprises\nsubject to privatization, for whom these relationships constituted a form of property or\ninvestment which they wished to preserve. In Poland, the dominant forms of\nprivatization allowed stakeholders to achieve negotiated, locally appropriate recognition\nof their stakes as part of the privatization process. Importantly, these negotiations\ninvolved structuring the relational context in which the post-privatization property rights\nwould operate.36 Russia's privatization employed the shortcut of converting\nstakeholders to stockholders according to standardized procedures. The allocation of\nproperty rights to stakeholders thus was detached from discussion of the substantive\ncharacter of their relations, and indeed promoted fragmentation of these relations.37 At\nthe same time, Russia's privatization offered outsiders a share of ownership in\nprivatized enterprises, without providing for (indeed, discouraging) pre-privatization\nnegotiation between outsiders and insiders. The upshot was an allocation of property\nrights carried out without a simultaneous restructuring of relational context. This\n\n35 For documentation on the Poland-Russian contrast, see the first paragraph of\nthis article.\n36 For important insights on this point, in the context of a discussion of\nimplications for entrepreneurship and restructuring, see Spicer, Kogut, and McDermott\n2000.\n37 Cf. the contrast between Poland and the Czech Republic in Spicer, Kogut, and\nMcDermott 2000 and McDermott 2001.\n\ndisjuncture created, for reasons explained below, massive incentives to contest the\nlegal events possession of corporate stock authorized.\nFor these arguments, I offer two sorts of evidence. First, I describe the course\nof privatization in Poland and Russia, demonstrating that the ability of stakeholders to\nachieve negotiated, locally appropriate legal recognition of their stakes existed in\nPoland, but was absent in Russia. Second, I demonstrate that the pattern of conflicts\nover property rights and the evolution of the legal situation in Russia are consistent with\na poor match between the laws relevant to stockholder property and the practical\nsituations in which it was embedded, distortions created by the form of privatization.\nAll evidence, including the pattern of legal change, indicates that such conflicts were far\nmore infrequent in Poland. Most dramatically, the form of corporate acquisitions\ndiffered drastically between the two countries. In Poland, corporate acquisitions took\nthe form of negotiated purchases of shares. In Russia, however, corporate acquisitions,\nwith great regularity, involved intense conflict in the legal arena and around it.\nOn the eve of privatization, it would have been hard to predict that privatized\nenterprises would have such distinct relationships to the law in the two countries. In\nboth Poland and Russia, crucial choices regarding the form of privatization were made\nin an extraordinarily difficult economic atmosphere in which the state seemed to have\nlittle real control over the enterprises it nominally owned. Reforms in the 1980's had\ndestroyed what coherence the planned economy had attained, leading to a loss of both\nmacroeconomic and microeconomic control mechanisms. The macroeconomic context\ninvolved roaring inflation, fed in part by a disorganized banking system in unsteady\n\ntransition from its status as an organ of accounting and planning under the command\neconomy. On the microeconomic level, in both countries, industrial enterprise\ninsiders--workers and managers--had gained substantial autonomy from higher-level\nplanning and management agencies. This autonomy was regularly used for what has\nbeen termed \"nomenklatura\" or \"spontaneous\" privatization, in which state managers\ntransferred assets and cash-flows to new legal entities. An effective summary of the\nsituation was that the state \"did not really own the assets it needed to privatize\" and\n\"various 'stakeholders,' including the managers, the employees, and the local\ngovernments, exercised substantial control over the allegedly public assets and could\nstop privatization if they wanted to.\" 38\nWhat differentiates the two cases is the reaction to these circumstances of\nmacroeconomic and microeconomic disarray by the liberals in charge of economic policy\nat the transition's outset. Roughly speaking, Polish reformers focused more on the\nmacroeconomy, and found themselves in a long political stalemate over privatization to\nrestore microeconomic control. Privatization went forward slowly, effectively on a case-\nby-case basis, with stakeholders granted a de facto veto over how privatization\noccurred. Veto rights were not property rights, however: reformers were not willing to\n\"to support preferential privatization to ... inside groups associated with the Communist\nregime.\"39\n\n38 These quotations, referring to Russia, are drawn from Boycko, Shleifer, and\nVishny 1995, 13; for similar pictures see Clarke and Kabalina 1995; McFaul 1995;\nRadygin 1995. On the parallel situation in Poland, see Orenstein 2001; Levitas 1994.\n39 Orenstein 2001, ?.\n\nRussian reformers, quite aware of the Polish impasse on privatization, made the\nopposite choice.40 When plans to privatize without insider preferences met political\nopposition, reformers created a program that would neutralize the resistance of\nstakeholders by turning them into stockholders. Even with outsiders excluded, they\nargued, stockholders would have an interest in maximizing the value of their property,\nwhich would manifest itself in firm restructuring and political support for capitalism.\nFast privatization would also help make the end of the planned economy irreversible.\nPrivatization in Russia\nRussian politicians, with the aid of outside advisors sophisticated in economics,\ndesigned the country's rapid and comprehensive initial wave of privatization (1992-\n1994) with several aims in mind. First, they felt that enterprises' managements were\nengaged in destructive asset-stripping, and wanted to forestall this by giving managers\nsome de jure control, so that there would be an incentive for enterprise adjustment.\nSecond, they wanted to offer incentives to \"stakeholders\" within the enterprise to\nsupport privatization, or at least not oppose it, by giving them privileged access to\nshares. Third, reformers hoped that despite the imperfections of economic legislation\nand the weakness of its enforcement, the new group of private property owners would\nbecome a constituency for property rights, pushing the state to strengthen them.41\n\n40 At the time Russia's privatization program was being designed, conventional\nwisdom was the Czechs' voucher privatization had successfully avoided the privatization\nstalemate dogging Poland. For the Russian reformers' close attention to the Eastern\nEuropean experience, see: Rosett and Liesman 1995; Anonymous 1992; Boycko,\nShleifer, and Vishny 1995, 83.\n41 Boycko, Shleifer, and Vishny 1995.\n\nThey did all they could to make privatization a rapid process. Once the\nprivatization law was passed in the summer of 1992, presidential orders soon followed\nimplementing the distribution of vouchers for use at auctions of property, and\nmandating legal transformation of enterprises into corporations. Over 22,000\nenterprises were registered as corporations by June 1994; of these, nearly 15,800 had\nbeen privatized.42\nRussia's privatization law offered three options for privatization, each of which\ngave insiders what have been called \"colossal\" benefits, but no detailed say over the\nshape of the process.43 The most popular option, chosen in 73% of cases, was \"Option\n2.\" This allowed workers and managers to purchase 51% of the shares, at 1.7 times\ntheir largely meaningless \"book value,\" determined mechanically by reference to Soviet-\nera nominal values. In another 25% of cases, \"Option 1\" was chosen; this option gave\n25% of the stock as nonvoting shares to the workers, with another 10% available at\naround a third less than the book value.44 Internal distributions of shares were also\nconducted as voucher auctions. Thus, the distribution of shares among stakeholders\nreflected not the substantive character of their stakes, but the number of vouchers they\ncould mobilize. Since insider stakeholders in these auctions were competing with one\nanother for a fixed number of shares, explicit negotiations that would link shareholding\nto the nature of stakes were practically out of the question. Naturally enough,\n\n42 Boycko, Shleifer, and Vishny 1995, 98, 106.\n43 Radygin 1995, 43;\n44 Boycko, Shleifer, and Vishny 1995, 75, 78; Radygin 1995, 39.\n\nmanagers' control over firm cash flows gave managers excellent chances in these\ninternal auctions.\nHaving chosen to give controlling blocks of stock to insiders they felt were\nextremely unlikely to do a good job of restructuring, the privatizers focused on making\nsure that shares could be traded after privatization, and opening the road to at least\nsome outsiders. Where Polish insiders that had privatized their firms through leasing-\nstyle arrangements regularly formed \"closed\" joint-stock companies, with existing\nshareholders eligible to buy further shares, this corporate form was practically\neliminated as an option for privatizing Russian firms.45\nThe fate of the shares not distributed to insiders varied. In general, the official\nintent was to have 29% sold at public voucher auctions, with the remaining 20%\n(under Option 2), held for future sale by the state.46 Voucher auctions were a major\nway that outsiders could acquire stock; efforts of insiders to rig auctions to their own\nbenefit and block outside purchasers were notorious, but not always successful.47\nRemaining state shares were slowly parceled out in a variety of ways over time,\nincluding via \"investment tenders\" that linked their purchase to a commitment of\nadditional investment in the firm.48\nNo form of privatization pursued in Russia involved discussion of the allocation of\nproperty rights between suppliers and customers, or of how to maximize the value of\n\n45 On Poland, see below; for Russia, see Boycko, Shleifer, and Vishny 1995, 75.\nVery few firms found a way around this ban.\n46 Radygin 1995, 64; Boycko, Shleifer, and Vishny 1995, 75, 78\n47 Radygin 1995, 67.\n48 Radygin 1997.\n\nenterprises as \"going concerns.\" Indeed, the procedures for privatization promoted\nisolation of stakeholders from one another, and conflict between them. Internal\nauctions transformed stakeholders into competitors. And because of the extremely\ncheap distribution of control in each privatized entity, privatization's design had a\nfragmenting effect: more valuable subunits of \"going concerns\" had every reason to\nsplit off if they could. Even existing integrated enterprises experienced intense conflicts\nover whether subdivisions would be privatized jointly or separately, as some\nsubdivisions had the legal right to do. Participants in longer supply chains had even\nfewer chances to come to a negotiated decision about the degree of their legal\nintegration. Efforts at joint privatization of technologically linked enterprises, forwarded\nby descendants of Soviet sectoral ministries and production associations, were resisted\nby privatization authorities, who could usually count on the backing of individual\nenterprises that would prefer to be privatized alone.49\nNot all large firms underwent voucher privatization. Most notoriously, some of\nthe most valuable energy and metals-producing firms were sold for a pittance to\nMoscow-based bankers, in an effort to build a coalition that would back Yeltsin's re-\nelection as president in 1996.50 As in voucher privatization, allocation of property rights\nhappened without negotiation between stakeholders. The situation was programmed\nfor conflict between outsiders with no stake in the firm beyond their stockholdings, and\n\n49 Boycko, Shleifer, and Vishny 1995.\n50 This interpretation may be considered undisputed, since it has been offered by\nAnatolii Chubais, who designed and managed the auctions.

Though in most cases in the outsiders\nwere indeed able to consolidate the control they had won through the loans-for-shares\nplan, it was in no case a trivial task.\nPrivatization in Poland\nPrivatization in Poland did not set the stage for long-running insider-outsider\nconflict centered around stock ownership. Polish Communists had retreated from their\nclaim to domination in the face of economic pressure and popular mobilization by the\nSolidarity workers' movement. Although it was intellectuals close to Solidarity who\nlaunched the economic reforms, they rejected the movement's longstanding advocacy\nof worker control.51 This led to sharp conflicts in the Sejm, Poland's parliament. In\n1990, the upshot was a compromise privatization law that provided for three forms of\nprivatization (although no provisions were made for implementing one of these, mass\nprivatization for free vouchers distributed to citizens).52 Some privatization was also\ncarried out using socialist-era bankruptcy provisions.53 It wasn't until 1993 that\nlegislation implementing mass privatization was enacted, at a time when the original\nreformers had already been voted out of office. Implementation did not begin until\n1995. 54\nThe hallmark of the most widespread privatization methods in Poland was a\nsimultaneous transformation of legal form and social substance.55 In other words,\n\n51 Orenstein 2001.\n52 Orenstein 2001.\n53 Blaszczyk et al. 1999, 3-5.\n54 Blaszczyk et al. 1999, 3-5.\n55 Cf. McDermott 2001.\n\nchanges in legal status were directly connected to negotiated reorganizations of the\nsocial environment in which law would be implemented.56 Particularly important was\nthat in the vast majority of cases commodification of stock was permitted only on terms\nacceptable to insiders. Furthermore, when outsiders did receive an opportunity to buy\ninto privatized firms, this was done either on terms decided by insiders or in a way that\ngave outsiders an overwhelming dominance in shareholding. Because there were so\nmany ways privatization took place, space considerations prevent a full review.\nHowever, a couple of examples give the flavor.\nDirect privatization. This method of privatization encompassed roughly a third of\nall privatized enterprises. Although it consisted in three subtypes, around two-thirds of\nthese privatizations took the form of installment purchases (usually termed leases) of\nthe assets of the former SOEs. The SOE was legally dissolved, and its assets\ntransferred to a new company formed by the SOE's employees, who had to commit to\nbuy at least 20% of the assets. After all the payments had been made, the assets\nbecame the property of the new company.57 The procedure was voluntary, and could\nonly happen after a vote of the employee council.58 The valuation placed on SOE\n\n56 For a key early perspective on this joint transformation, see Levitas 1994, who\nargued that enterprise insiders \"are trying to wean themselves away form the state by\nsimultaneously redefining the ownership structures of their firms, their productive\nprofiles, and the markets in which they expect to function.\"\n57 Kozarzewski, Krajewski, and Majak 2000, 38. Some leasing arrangements\napparently did not terminate with property transfer, though it is unclear how many.\nKozarzewski, Krajewski, and Majak 2000, 38. See also Levitas 1994, 107-108.\n58 Kozarzewski, Krajewski, and Majak 2000, 38. This changed after passage of a\nnew law that came into force in 1997; which allowed outsiders to initiate privatization,\nand also tried to promote the inclusion of more outsiders in the new joint-stock\ncompany created out of the dissolved SOE. However, by this point at least 80% of all\n\nassets was regularly such that it was beyond the means of the company's employees,\nmeaning that outsiders had to be involved. However, it was the newly organizing firm\nthat both located buyers and determined \"which of these buyers to let into the process.\n... [Outsiders were] usually drawn from the network of the firm's suppliers and\nbuyers.\"59 The approving authorities included the SOE's \"founding body,\" often an arm\nof local government, which brought another stakeholder into pre-privatization\nnegotiations.\nSurvey research suggests that the nearly 90% of new enterprises formed in this\nway employed corporate charter provisions restricting the sale of shares to outsiders.\nThese restrictions did not block them, however, from issuing new shares to allow\nadditional outsiders to buy into the company--presumably, when this was a legal form\nthat suited both bodies.60\nMass privatization. Poland's version of mass privatization involved a complex\ntwo-tier procedure in which Poles were given certificates for shares in 15 newly created\ninvestment funds, which in turn were allocated shares in the 512 state enterprises\n(about 11% of all privatized enterprises) participating in this program. For present\npurposes, the important point is that participation in the program was subject to veto\neither by management or by the employees council. Though of course this did not\npreclude subsequent conflict between insiders and outsiders, the procedure left high-\n\ndirect privatizations had been accomplished. Blaszczyk et al. 1999, 307; Dabrowski\n2001, 140; Kozarzewski, Krajewski, and Majak 2000.\n59 Levitas 1994, 108-109; McDermott 2001.\n60 Kozarzewski and Woodward 2001, 22.\n\nvisibility, government backed outsiders with a dominant share of the outstanding\nstock.61\nPrivatization's legacy for corporate legality\nState socialism built an economy of idiosyncracies.62 As the system approached\nits demise, each enterprise operated according to an accretion of particularistic bargains\nwith planners and ministerial supervisors over such things as norms for material use\nand allocation of capital to different purposes. This diversity of local situation, of\nproduction and its organization, of course persisted after privatization. Nevertheless,\nthe distinct forms of privatization in Poland and Russia did produce characteristic\npatterns in the relationship between corporate stock as a legal form and the social\nsubstance underlying it--the day-to-day routines and interactions that make a firm a\n\"going concern.\"\nIn Poland, all evidence suggests that insiders' veto on privatization generally\nmeant that outsiders could acquire firms only when insiders felt that had something to\ngain from it. There was regularly an option to privatize as a closed corporation with\nnonfungible shares, which many employee-manager buyouts adopted. True, some\nfirms' poor financial situation left them faced with an unpleasant choice between\noutright liquidation and a bank-led reconciliation plan that could involve a reassignment\nof property rights through debt-for-equity swaps. But even in such cases the deals\nwere negotiated on the basis of mutual gains for creditors and debtors, not as a zero-\n\n61 Rapacki 2000; Blaszczyk and Woodward 2001.\n62 Woodruff 2000, ?.\n\nsum division of property.63 In short, property rights were transferred to outsiders when\ninsiders were willing to accept the legal consequences.\nIn Russia, by contrast, outsiders received shares only through tenacious efforts\nby central government officials over the objections of enterprise managers.64 Outside\nshareholders represented a threat to the nearly total control managers had over\nenterprise finances.65 Stakeholder-shareholders (i.e., workers) could be kept in line\nthrough their other dependencies.66 But outsiders were simply new claimants for the\nfirm's earnings, who could conceivably be backed by the courts or bring other resources\nto bear. Given the extremely cheap valuations the privatization process put on Russian\nfirms,67 managers had every reason to purchase as many shares as they could to\nsecure their control over their enterprises. Surveys in the immediate aftermath of\nprivatization suggested that insiders in the median firm controlled 52% of the stock,\nand that general directors, on average, aspired to have 69% of the stock controlled by\ninsiders.68 They also took other measures to prevent outsiders from acquiring stock or\nexercising the legal rights it was supposed to afford. Thus, unlike in Poland, allocation\nof stock resulted not from acquiescence of the firm's de facto owners when they were\nable to turn it to their advantage, but over the objections of these owners.\nThese contrasting histories explain why Russian privatization set the stage for\nregular, systematic frictions between legal facts and contextual factors. On the side of\n\n63 McDermott 2001\n64 Boycko, Shleifer, and Vishny 1995;Radygin 1995; Frye 1997.\n65 Boycko, Shleifer, and Vishny 1995, 117.\n66 Clarke and Kabalina 1995.\n67 Boycko, Shleifer, and Vishny 1995, 117-120.\n\nlegal facts, the distribution of stock shares set up insiders as majority and outsiders as\nminority owners. Contextually, these outsiders did not share any network relations with\nthe insiders. Another important element of context was material interest: corporate\nstock's market value was extremely low. For insiders, this meant that sales were\nsenseless since they brought little reward and might threaten effective control.69 For\noutsiders, finding a way to force management to share profits would greatly increase\nthe value of stock holdings, setting the stage for conflict.\nPolish privatization did not create these legal and contextual features. Insiders\nwere minority shareholders, not majority ones. Outsiders were often drawn from\nexisting networks and in any event had to negotiate with the insiders, who could veto\ntheir participation. Finally, the extremely low valuations stemming from the voucher\nprocess were avoided in a situation where firms were sold rather than distributed.\nIn sum, Russian privatization created an unsustainable combination of legal\nfacts, contextual factors, and laws. Polish privatization did not. Although one could try\nto give evidence for this proposition in a number of ways, including describing the\nincredible prevalence and intensity of corporate conflicts in Russia. Others, however,\nhave done this.70 Instead, I will focus on an indicator directly related to my argument\non the impact of tensions between contextual and legal factors: actors' use of legal\n\n68 Blasi, Kroumova, and Kruse 1997, 193-194.\n69 Wintrobe 1998.\n70 Black, Kraakman, and Tarassova 2000; Fox and Heller 2000. Although both\nstudies draw some useful links the difficulties of corporate governance to privatization,\nneither suggests that other ways of embedding or contextualizing the relations between\ninsiders and outsiders would have avoided the issue.\n\n\"loopholes\" to change legal facts in the context of zero-sum legal battles.71 Although it\nis more difficult to prove the absence of a phenomenon than its presence, I also offer\nbrief contrasts to Poland that suggest the absence of parallel developments there.\nRussia: Exploiting the legal definition of value as a loophole\nThis section details the way the configuration of legal and contextual factors\ncreated by Russian privatization--a fissure between insider and outsider shareholders,\nwith the former unwilling to share net revenues or sell their stakes in the firm at low\nprevalent prices--prompted a search for loopholes. These loopholes had the effect of\nresolving conflicts by forcing one side to surrender stock in return for legally\ndetermined, but inadequate, compensation. The elimination of competitors' ownership\nclaims left both de jure and de facto control in one set of hands. The first example is a\ncase history that illustrates in some detail the use of such a loophole to resolve\ncontestation over property rights. The second example chronicles the emergence of an\nindustry devoted to debt-for-equity takeovers, which used bankruptcy law to contest\nthe property rights of manager-shareholders unwilling to sell.72\nCase: The Conflict at the Volgog ad Factory of Drilling Machinery.\nr\n\n73 This conflict,\nwhich centered around a factory with around 30% of the Russian market for oil-drilling\nmachinery, pitted minority shareholders with 43% of the outstanding stock against\n\n71 An alternative to exploiting loopholes to solve the mismatch between legal and\ncontextual factors would be to seek to change the latter--embedding shareholding\nrelations in other forms of cooperation. This also took place: for an insightful analysis,\nsee Pappe 2000.\n72 For discussions, see Radygin 2002; Deriabina 2002; Volkov 2002.\n73 Based on press reports and the text of relevant laws available from the\nEmerging Markets database at www.securities.com.\n\nmajority shareholders with 51%. The majority shareholders, who controlled the\nfactory's management, were a Volgograd-based banking group called NOKSS. The\noutside shareholder, initially, was the United Machinery Group (known by its Russian\nacronym as OMZ), a holding company that controlled much of the rest of oil-drill\nmarket. OMZ, having acquired its shares apparently through door-to-door purchases\nfrom workers who had received them in privatization, spent more than a year trying to\nreach an arrangement with management and the majority shareholders regarding\nrepresentation on the firm's board and division of its profits. Eventually, OMZ turned\nover 40% of its shares to MINFIN, a company specializing in aggressive efforts to\nenforce legal claims. MINFIN, for unclear reasons, split these shares among two\nsmaller partnerships.\nRussian corporate law allows minority shareholders controlling more than 30% of\noutstanding stock to call an extraordinary shareholders meeting; the quorum for such a\nmeeting's decisions to be binding is 50%. Representatives of the majority shareholders\nfailed to appear at the scheduled meeting (held on the morning of January 1st, 2001).\nIn the event that a quorum is not present, the law allows calling of a second meeting\ntwenty days later, with a quorum of only 30%. MINFIN called such a meeting, and\nelected a new general director and a new chairman of the board. The new general\ndirector (a business-school student, as was the chairman of the board) did not try to\ntake control of the factory's day-to-day operations, though he did make an effort to\nenter the plant grounds and was stopped by security. He also asked for the plant's seal\n\n(required for binding documents). Denied, MINFIN had a new seal produced, and tried,\nat least formally, to win control over the firm's bank accounts.\nThe majority shareholders declared the MINFIN-organized shareholders'\nmeetings illegitimate, claiming they had not been properly notified. They then took two\nfurther, more dramatic actions. One of these was to arrange for the arrest of the\nalternative general director and board chairman for \"forging\" the company's seal on\nofficial documents. The arrest was carried out by Volgograd policemen, who traveled to\nMoscow to make the arrest and then transferred the two students to pretrial detention\nin Volgograd. They were fairly quickly released with a pledge to appear for trial.\nThe second action proved to be of more enduring significance. According to law\non joint-stock companies, companies' board of directors were allowed to take decisions\non stock splits or on stock consolidations. The majority shareholders used this provision\nto carry out a consolidation of the company's nearly 190,000 outstanding shares into\nfour shares. Because the two MINFIN partnerships held less than 25% of the shares\neach, they were not entitled to one of the four new shares in the company. Instead,\nthe law specified compensation based on the board's determination of reasonable value\nfor the outstanding shares.74 The board paid the minority shareholders around\n$400,000. By contrast, MINFIN had some time earlier publicly offered $7 million for an\nadditional 25% of shares in the company (whose annual sales were around $30\n\n74 The price was supposed to be that a \"uncoerced buyer\" would pay; evaluation\nwas supposed also to \"take into account\" public quotations of the stock's price--none in\nthis case--as well as what an uncoerced buyer would pay for the entire outstanding\ncapital stock. The latter provision appears designed to capture the possibility of an\n\nmillion). The two shares actually issued in the consolidation went to the existing\nmajority shareholders, who then started proceedings to convert the firm into a private\npartnership. MINFIN then pursued suits and regulatory appeals contesting the\nconsolidation, losing in the local courts, winning once in at a higher-level court in\nMoscow, and finally losing on a second appeal. It continued to claim (to no apparent\navail) that the board taking the consolidation decision was not legitimately elected. The\nmajority shareholders were left with full control over their property.\nIt's worth noting that this provision of the law had been on the books since early\n1997, but seems to have first been exploited in this way in 2001. The notion that this\nwas a poorly drafted law is thus too simple. If the pattern of motivations were\ndifferent, this provision of the law might be entirely unoffensive. It was particular\ncircumstances--the particular struggle over control and division of firm profits--that led\nto the search for this loophole.\nDebt-for-equity takeovers. The minority shareholders in the case just described\nannounced their willingness to purchase the firm in question, but they were not able to\ncome to an agreement on the price. This situation was very typical. Firms intent on\nindustrial acquisitions--especially the largest Russian business groups--found pursuing\nthem through stock purchase very difficult. This led to a search for loopholes that\nwould force insider shareholders to part with their shares.\n\nundervaluation due to the presence of a control bonus, but it did not offer any detail on\nhow this control bonus was to be calculated.\n\nAcquisition specialists found a solution in exploiting the secondary debt market to\nas a mechanism to achieve debt-for-equity hostile takeovers.75. Would-be acquirers\nbought up the outstanding loans of a target firm from its creditors. Because they were\nnot entrenched insiders, creditors were willing to sell. Acquirers then used the court\nsystem to try to enforce these debts in a way that would give them control over the\nassets of the target--ideally, by compensating debts with \"undervalued\" stock, though\nthe mechanisms were many. Thus, these were debt-for-equity hostile takeovers.\nBecause assets were the target, creditors would often seek ways to prevent\ntargeted debtors from paying off their outstanding obligations, since this would leave\nthe creditor only with money and not the more valuable assets. Legal provisions\ndesigned to protect minority shareholders--by giving them the right to challenge certain\ncompany decisions--were one way that hostile acquirers could prevent loan repayment\nfrom taking place. Another was to push the target firm into bankruptcy proceedings,\nduring which it would be run by a court-appointed administrator, who could often be\nconvinced to interfere with the repayment of debts that had led to the bankruptcy in\nthe first place.\nThe search for legal mechanisms that could force debt-for-equity exchanges\ncreated an entire bankruptcy industry, devoted to facilitating hostile takeovers. These\nbecame a key basis for the rapid expansions of the biggest business groups after the\nAugust 1998 crisis, a time when high export commodity prices and weak domestic ones\ngave these groups an especially strong position. These hostile takeovers were\n\n75 For discussions of the prevalence of these mechanisms and examples of their\n\nsometimes quite hostile indeed. The high stakes attached to various legal events--such\nas payment or nonpayment of debt--created strong incentives to contest them.\nSometimes, as these contests were pursued in different jurisdictions, conflicting rulings\nwould be issued, creating a situation of multiple legal realities, often degenerating into\nphysical confrontation as different parties tried to enforce their version of the legal\nfacts.\nThe empirical developments just surveyed illustrate the distance between law\nand the situation-types in which it was being invoked. In the case of the conflict at the\nVolgograd factory, the legal provision for consolidation of shares of stock was turned\nthe purpose of expropriating minority shareholders. In the debt-for-equities hostile\ntakeovers, laws postulating a situation of creditors seeking to recover debts were\nlikewise inserted into conflicts between insiders and would-be acquirers. The most\ndramatic illustration of the split between the law's implied situation-type and that of its\npractical application was the phenomenon of creditors seeking to avoid being repaid.\nThe Polish contrast. Proving the absence of contested shareholder property\nrights in the Poland case is a more difficult task than documenting their prevalence in\nRussia. However, the available record of how firm acquisitions have proceeded displays\nno parallel conflicts. Consider the history of the Elektrim conglomerate, which until\n2001 was one of the country's most prominent and successful business empires.\nElektrim began as a state trading firm coordinating imports and exports for industries\noffering supplies and services related to electricity generation and transmission. After\n\nuse see Radygin 2002; Deriabina 2002; Volkov 2002.\n\nbeing privatized itself, Elektrim used its export revenues to fund a large number of\nacquisitions in Polish industries--at one point, it owned controlling or substantial stakes\nin over 100 firms. It was able to purchase dominant stakes in many of these firms\nthrough the privatization process, after offering wage, employment, and investment\nguarantees. More strikingly, it was able to use sales of minority stakes in enterprises it\nhad acquired to fund further acquisitions.76 This strategy would have been completely\nunimaginable in the Russian context, where majority owners scorned the desultory\nreceipts available on the stock market, and would have had a hard time finding\nsufficiently large blocks of shares to purchase with these receipts in any event.\nElektrim management did sometimes find itself in conflicts with shareholders. In\nlate 1998 the company revealed that it had failed to disclose an obligation to sell an\nasset cheaply. Regulators' reaction to this incident has been cited as an indicator of the\neffectiveness of Polish securities law enforcement.77 And the Polish SEC did indeed levy\na fine of $133,000 against the firm, and instruct prosecutors to inquire into possible\ncriminal consequences. Nevertheless, compared to the $150 million in market\ncapitalization the firm lost in the aftermath of the scandal these factors seem relatively\ntrivial. Immediately after the scandal broke, and well before the enforcement action,\nthe firm's CEO was in London seeking to reassure investors. His fairly quick subsequent\nresignation (despite a assertion of legal innocence), and replacement by a new\nmanager who began a forceful campaign to reassure investors are further signs of the\ncrucial influence of the market. Given that Elektrim was trading at a very large price-to-\n\n76 Michaels 1995.\n\nearnings ratio of roughly 40 before the scandal, there was a great deal of wealth to be\nlost by angering investors.78\nThe contrast to the behavior of large Russian firms in the same period could not\nbe more striking. Their disregard for shareholders was manifest. But the costs for\nangering shareholders were correspondingly low. When in March 1999 the Russian oil\nconglomerate Yukos used a dubious court order to exclude minority shareholders from\na meeting in which assets were diverted from the firm, it was trading at P/E ratio of\naround 4, one tenth of Elektrim's.79 It no longer had anything to lose from offending\nstockholders.\nEvidence suggests that such situations of an enormous split between the market\nprice of stock and its value to majority owners were infrequent in Poland. Indeed, a\nstudy of the premia investors pay for large blocks of shares on the Polish stockmarket\nrevealed them to be \"substantially lower than in well developed markets.\"80 Debate\nover the amendments to the bankruptcy law in 2002-2003 in no way echoed the\nRussian discussions of bankruptcy as a mechanism of property transfer. Instead,\ndiscussions focused on more familiar creditor-debtor issues, and resolving collective\n\n77 Glaeser, Johnson, and Shleifer 2001.\n78 Elektrim appoints outsider 1999; Poland's Elektrim appeals to Polish SEC over\nfine 1999;Laidlaw 1998;Michaels 1998;Warburg Dillon Read 1999. Elektrim eventually\nfailed for unrelated reasons.\n79 On the incident see Black, Kraakman, and Tarassova 2000, which also\ndescribes the abysmal valuations of Russian firms in this era but describes them solely\nas consequence, not cause, of poor corporate governance; for the P/E ratio see Troika\nDialog Research 2000.\n80 Trojanowski 2002\n\naction problems of creditors.81 These developments all suggest that the characteristic\nsituation in which Polish corporate and bankruptcy law operates does not involve the\nparticular incentives to contest shareholders' property rights found in Russia.\nConclusion: from sociology to politics\nThis article has presented an \"economic sociology of law\" argument about the\nways in which Russian and Polish privatization shaped the subsequent destiny of\ncorporate governance in the two countries. By enabling embedded relations among\nstockholders, and avoiding a huge undervaluation of stock in the course of privatization,\nPoland created contextual factors that supported the legal facts of ownership. Russian\nprivatization procedures isolated shareholders from one another and involved\nextraordinarily low stock valuations, a set of contextual factors that set the stage for\nlong-running, zero-sum conflicts over the legal facts of stock ownership.\nAn economic sociology of law approach can improve one's account of the politics\nof making property rights secure. In particular, the ESOL approach avoids the\nassumption that only a strengthening of state commitment and/or capacity to enforce\nproperty rights will make them secure. This assumption can take various forms. In the\ncontext of a game-theoretic analysis, the issue of state capacity is frequently analyzed\nusing an argument about the potential feedback between the prevalence of violation of\nlaw and the state's ability to contain it. The implication is that either the state collapses\nin a downward spiral of lawlessness that increasingly overwhelms authorities, or law-\nabiding behavior by the many makes containment of the law-violating few ever\n\n81 More power to the creditors 2003.\n\nsimpler.82 A similar argument regarding Russia is that the absence of effective\nregulation after privatization fostered the spread of majority owners willing to flout\nminority property rights, since such owners were able to extract more from the firms\nunder their control.83 The prevalence of such unscrupulous majority shareholders\nmeans that Russia \"needs a serious, top-down effort to control corruption, organized\ncrime, and self-dealing [by corporate insiders],\" and even \"selective renationalization\nand reprivatization.\"84\nOther analyses emphasize not state capacity to secure property rights but rather\nthe political will to do so. One technocratic version links good corporate governance to\n\"strict enforcement of securities law by a highly motivated regulator,\" arguing that the\nsecret to Poland's success was reliance on a regulator handsomely rewarded for\nenforcement, rather than weak courts without such incentives.85 Alternatively, the\nrequisite political will might be sought among property owners. Some of those closely\ninvolved with Russian privatization, for instance, argued that the political clout of the\noutside shareholders created by privatization would successfully prod the state to\nsecure corporate legality, an expectation that proved unfulfilled.86\nBoth the arguments from feedback loops and those from political will posit an\nunmediated interaction between state and society, taking conflict over corporate\n\n82 Sachs 1994; Johnson 1997; Roland 2000.\n83 Black, Kraakman, and Tarassova 2000, 1735. Note that this argument\nportrays the division of firm revenue as a zero-sum process.\n84 Black, Kraakman, and Tarassova 2000, 1798.\n85 Glaeser, Johnson, and Shleifer 2001, 853.\n86 Boycko, Shleifer, and Vishny 1995, 128; Black, Kraakman, and Tarassova\n2000, 1753; Shleifer and Treisman 2000, 38.\n\nproperty rights as a given. The ESOL approach recognizes property rights as situated in\nconcrete social and economic interactions, which may or may not be marked by conflict.\nBy transcending a binary approach to law-consistent behavior (law-abiding or law-\nviolating equilibria; presence or absence of political will for enforcement), it makes\npossible the mapping of more intricate trajectories of legal and political change.\nSuch a trajectory has unfolded in the Russian case. An unstable configuration of\nlegal facts and contextual factors gave rise first to an effort to use loopholes to alter the\nlegal facts. But changing patterns of property distribution eventually prepared the\nground for new laws that would increase the security of property.87 The trajectory is\nespecially clear in the case of debt-for-equity takeovers. In the fall of 2002, Russia\npassed new legislation weakening the rights of creditors and minority shareholders\nwhile strengthening those of owner-managers.88 The new bankruptcy code, in\nparticular, contained many provisions designed to hinder forced debt-for-equity\nexchanges. These provisions force creditors to try vigorous measures to collect debts\nbefore initiating bankruptcy proceedings, and allow firms in bankruptcy proceedings to\nexit them by repaying outstanding debts. Furthermore, management and the creditors\nmust jointly agree on the bankruptcy administrator, from a list proposed by an\nindependent association of qualified administrators, making it less likely that the\nadministrator will be willing to shift assets from management. Related legislation\n\n87 Boone and Rodionov 2001 described the process of business conglomerates'\nconsolidation and argued that big business was embracing law as a means of stabilizing\nproperty rights. For a vigorous counterargument, based however on evidence\npredating the most recent legal changes, see Barnes 2003.\n88 See Andreev 2002; Medvedeva, Timofeev, and Iukhnin 2003.\n\nregulating commercial courts now makes it harder for minority shareholders to interfere\nwith management decisions than previously.\nIt was representatives of big business, who had used debt-for-equity takeovers\nto expand, that did the most to give the new laws the form they took.89 For instance,\nwhen President Putin vetoed the initial version of the bankruptcy bill, passed by\nparliament in the summer 2002, he did so in part to include longstanding suggestions of\nbig business lobbyists to eliminate provisions preventing firms from paying their debts\nwhen able to do so.\nThe position of big business, a number of observers plausibly suggest, reflected\nthe fact that displacement of the entrenched insiders created by privatization was all\nbut complete. The vast bulk of the country's most valuable private enterprises had\nbeen subordinated, both de facto and de jure, to a handful of conglomerates run by\nRussia's richest and most powerful.90 These empires grew based on their ability to\ndisturb the flow of controllable legal events that constitutes the exercise of property\nrights. Their behavior during the debate on the new bankruptcy law suggested that as\nthe new owner-managers, they were not eager to see others repeat their\naccomplishments.91\n\n89 Medvedeva, Timofeev, and Iukhnin 2003 describes the preparation of the bill.\nFor an example of the intense interest of the country's largest business lobby in the bill,\nsee Rossiiskii soiuz predprinimatelei i promyshlennikov 2002; Liubimtseva 2002.\n90 Dolgopiatova 2002, 1-90.\n91 Medvedeva, Timofeev, and Iukhnin 2003 describes the multiple interests\ninvolved, noting that while some big businesses wished to secure extant acquisitions,\nothers opposed the law in hopes of maintaining their ability to acquire new assets\nthrough bankruptcy. Also: author's interview with Tatiana Medvedeva, Moscow, June\n2003; author's interview with Aleksei Iukhnin, Moscow, June 2003. For a vigorous\n\nFrom an ESOL perspective, it is entirely intelligible that in line with changes in\nthe legal facts of property, conglomerates would shift from manipulating extant laws to\ndestabilize others' property rights to promoting legislative change stabilizing their own.\nHowever, this transition does not fit easily with approaches highlighting the impact of\nfeedback effects or political will on enforcement. For instance, relying on equilibrium\narguments and feedback effects, one scholar asserted in 2000 that \"the relative\nirreversibility created [by mass privatization] has locked the Russian economy in an\ninefficient situation where interest groups who gained most from mass privatization (the\nfamous oligarchs [phrase in original]) have become so powerful as to block further\nreform such as tax reform, government reform, stronger law enforcement, and stronger\nsecurity of property rights.\"92 Yet, just three years later, the \"famous oligarchs\" have\nbecome among the most active promoters of all the values mentioned.\nIn a defense of historical institutionalism, Thelen has argued for a conception of\npolitics \"as a dynamic process that frequently produces unintended consequences as\ndifferent, ongoing processes interact. Perspectives that conceive of change as the\nbreakdown of one equilibrium and its replacement with another do not capture this\nwell.\"93 Explaining institutional order through equilibrium fetishizes stability and\neviscerates investigation into the roots and forms of change. One can add that the\nmodeling of institutions in a game context, which requires a self-contained description\n\nargument against the position that big business is embracing law to stabilize its\nproperty, based however on evidence predating the most recent legal changes, see\nBarnes 2003.\n92 Roland 2000, 337. For a similar, but more influential formulation see Hellman\n1998.\n\nof actors' interests and options in an indefinitely repeated game rules out investigation\nof \"the contingent temporal alignments and simultaneous movement of relatively\nindependent institutional orderings that riddle political action.\"94 The arguments\npresented above suggest that these historical-institutionalist points apply as much to\neconomic institutions as to straightforwardly political ones, and to the interactions\nbetween the two categories of institutions as well. Incompatibilities between legal\nfacts, contextual factors, and law can touch off evolutionary processes that eventually\ngive rise to demands for legislative reform.\nIn Russia, this took place only after a reconfiguration of context made it feasible\nfor law to be an effective tool in constraining action. The process by which demands\nmoved from society to politics was mediated through the local arenas in which the\nmeaning of law was determined.95 This causal pathway is quite unlike the reformers'\npresumption that shareholders automatically would become a coalition for the\nstrengthening of property rights once they had been granted them.\nThus, a decade after privatization, the outcome in Russia is tending toward a\nreconciling of law and context. In a \"trajectory of improvement,\" loopholes that\ndestabilized property rights are being closed. Former villains of corporate governance\nare now its heroes as they seek to convert their vast holdings into the liquid currency of\n\n93 Thelen 1999, 383-384, drawing on Orren and Skowronek 1994.\n94 Orren and Skowronek 1994, 321.

As Weber and\nmany of the other authors here mobilized have emphasized, law is only superficially a\nneutral instrument: \"conditions of formal freedom are officially available to all; actually,\nhowever, they are accessible only to the owners of property and thus support their very\nautonomy and power positions.\"97 Put differently, law stabilizes distributions of\nproperty and bargaining power arising from social and economic resources.98 It in no\nway provides security for the justice of these distributions.\n\n96 Whalen 2002; Chazan 2002.\n97 Quoted in Swedberg 1998, 102.\n98 Kennedy 1993.\n\nWORKS CITED\n\nAndreev, Anatolii. 2002.

What\nhappens to a city when all investment decisions are made without land markets? What are the outcomes\nwhen the forces described by familiar urban models aren't allowed to work? This paper describes the\nstructure of Russian cities after seventy years of Soviet development. This is the longest socialist\nexperience on record and its results are of paramount interest to urban economists. In the absence of\nprice signals and of economic incentives to recycle land over time, the administrative-command process\nhas led to a startling pattern of land use. Its central feature is a perverse population density gradient\nwhich rises as one moves away from the center of the city. The Soviet city is also characterized by\nrusting factories in prime locations and distant residential areas in the suburbs. Such a structure tends to\nmaximize the economic and social inefficiency of the socialist city and environmental ill-effects. Real\nestate prices are now emerging with market-oriented urban reforms. Their negative gradient signals\nagain the massive scale and fundamental nature of past land misallocation in the Soviet city. The\nexperience of socialist cities is also a powerful warning about the ill effects of public ownership and\nallocation of land to achieve the \"socialization\" of land rents.\n\nCITIES WITHOUT LAND MARKETS:\nLOCATION AND LAND USE IN THE SOCIALIST CITY\n\nI.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe rejection of private ownership of capital and of the means of production has been a\ncentral tenet of Marxist ideology. To what extent does the socialist city differ from the market city?\nHow does its land use differ from the outcomes of our familiar models of residential and business\nlocation based on competitive land markets developed in the tradition of Alonso, Wingo, Muth, Mills\nand now extended beyond the monocentric city? Also, what happens when public ownership and\npublic allocation of land is the road chosen to solve the long-standing concern with the \"capture\" of\npublic generated land rents by private owners? What is the systemic impact of the administrative-\ncommand system as a substitute to the market? The purpose of this paper is to describe the long-term\neffects of administrative-command systems which do away with land markets on location and land use\nin cities.\n\nThe evidence presented comes from Russian cities which are the urban centers with the\nlongest history of development in the absence of land markets. Except for the old historical centers,\nalmost all of Russian urban growth has taken place during the Soviet era 1917-1991. The fact that urban\ndevelopment took place in a period when land was nationalized and administratively allocated, rather\nthan sold on an open market for a price, has had a very profound impact and negative impact on the\ninternal organization of Russian cities. The combination of Marxist ideology, national institutions,\ndomestic economic system and level of urbanization has produced somewhat different results in each\nsocialist economy. However, it is quite relevant to speak of a \"socialist city\" wherever urban\ndevelopment is expected to proceed without land markets and land use decisions are made\nadministratively.1/ The socialist city experiments bring out multiple issues of property rights,\ninstitutional organization and governance, agency problems, as well as urban planning regulations. This\npaper focuses only on the striking spatial anomalies and pervasive urban inefficiencies caused by the\ninability of an administrative-command system to evaluate even very approximately the value of a land\nsite and its opportunity cost in alternative uses and to remedy the grossest land use misallocations.\n\n1/\nOur initial interest in the structure of socialist cities started with field work in China in 1988, see Renaud and\nBertaud, 1989. A seminal influence were the papers in French and Hamilton, 1979. Qualitative results comparable to\nthose presented here for Moscow and St. Petersburg have also been obtained in the case of other socialist cities such as\nWarsaw in Poland and Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin in China, see Bertaud, 1994.\n\nII.\nLAND ALLOCATION IN CITIES WITHOUT MARKETS\n\nIn Soviet Russia, and other socialist cities as well, administrative decisions based on\n\"needs\" and norms govern the use and quantity of land consumed. By contrast, in a market economy,\nland price differentials constitute the most important factors determining quantity and location of land\nconsumed. These divergent principles governing land allocation and land use could be expected to\nproduce different spatial and efficiency outcomes. A quantitative land use analysis of Moscow and St.\nPetersburg reveals that there are indeed major differences between Russian cities and market economy\ncities in the distribution and consumption of land.2 Inspection of land use maps or satellite photos of\nother Russian cities confirms that these are systemic features of the socialist city.3\n\nA. Absence of Incentives to Recycle Land in Soviet and Other Socialist Cities\n\nAs their economy and their population grow, cities expand through the progressive\naddition of concentric rings, similar to the process for trees in successive growing seasons. New rings\nare added to the periphery as the city grows. Within each ring, land use reflects the combined effects of\ndemography, technology, and the economy at the time when the ring was developed. While this\norganic incremental growth is common to all cities, in a market city changing land prices exert their\npressure simultaneously in all areas of the city, not just at the periphery. Land prices exert a powerful\ninfluence to recycle already developed land in the inner rings when the type and intensity of the existing\nuse is too different from the land's optimum economic use. Thus, changing land values bring a built-in\nurban dynamism as continuous variations in land prices trigger land use changes by putting a constant\npressure on the existing uses of land.\n\nBy contrast, under Russia's command economy, the absence of land prices removed all\nincentives to redevelop built-up areas. Once land was allocated, it was almost never recycled. Without\nprice signals, it was administratively simpler to respond to current land demand pressure by developing\nat the periphery than to redevelop well-located areas with obsolete land uses. While the city expanded\noutward, land use in already developed areas remained unchanged. One striking illustration of this\nphenomenon is the persistence and uniformity of housing types in successive rings around Moscow.\nEach type is usually designated by the period in which it was built. Thus, driving from the center of\nMoscow, one passes through rings of Stalin, Khrushchev, and then Brezhnev flats.\n\nThe methodology used is based on the measurement of population density in the built-up area, i.e. the\npopulation within two concentric rings at 1 km interval divided by the built-up area within this interval. This built-up\narea does not include large parks, physical obstacles to land use such as rivers and lakes, and any undeveloped area.\nThese densities are derived from digitized land use maps, satellite photographs and detailed databases related to land\nuses by type of users. These data bases are routinely maintained by local urban planning offices. The geocoded data\nwas analyzed with a graphics-based GIS software.\n\nIn Chinese cities, however, the socialist land use system has a much shorter and more recent history than\nRussia. Also, Russia has completed its urbanization but China is just entering its phase of most massive urban growth.\nAs a result, the historical Chinese urban core which was developed under a market economy has kept a much larger\nrelative importance than in Russia. Moreover, in China, the absence of large urban infrastructure and public transport\ninvestment plus severe under investment in housing between 1949 and 1979 has led to more compact cities and\nreinforced the population density at the center. But now, under the rapid urban investment of the last decade,\nadministrative processes operating without land markets are again generating outcomes similar to those of Soviet cities:\nnew residential floor area ratios follow the Russian pattern and are higher in the periphery than in the center. (For more\ncomparative data, see Bertaud, 1994).\n\nThis socialist land use process creates sizable enclaves of \"fallow\" or \"dead land\" areas\nwhich combine low levels of economic activity with negative environmental qualities. The Soviet\nadministrative command economy has generated an urban development process with two characteristic\nfeatures of large land use inefficiencies: (1) Areas with obsolete land use occupy large amounts of the\ntotal city area; and, (2) Households tend to be concentrated in the periphery with increasing densities\nfurther from the center and \"historically\" low densities in central areas. This pattern tends to increase\ntransport costs and pollution by requiring higher energy expenditures without providing better amenities\nsuch as larger plot size or a better environment that would be the normal trade-off for increasing\ncommuting distance in a market economy.\n\nB. Why Rusting Factories in Prime Urban Locations?\n\nThe failure to recycle land occupied by old activities of little value yields several spatial\noutcomes: centrally located industrial belts, large total amount of urban industrial area, low job density\nin the industrial belts, and central land areas fragmented by dense railway networks. There are four\nmajor consequences.\n\nFirst, of these pathologies, the most startling are the old industrial belts that ring\nMoscow and St. Petersburg. Developed during the 1930's and 1950's, these belts are still spread\nbetween 4 and 8 kilometers from the city centers. These industrial land use bottlenecks have never been\nrecycled, even though the land values would have been prohibitively expensive for these enterprises\nhad market land prices been used. The absence of market signals resulted in a land use freeze that\npushed residential areas further toward the city periphery than in market cities. Meanwhile, obsolete and\nlow density activities have remained as enclaves on accessible and well serviced land.4\n\nThe absence of land prices and the dominance of industrial planning in government\nthinking and policies explains the second phenomenon. Not only are Moscow and St. Petersburg\ncharacterized by centrally-located industrial belts, but also the total industrial land area within these\ncities is extraordinarily large. For example, in Moscow, 31.5% of the total built-up area is used by\nindustries, compared with 5% in Paris, 6% in Seoul, and 5% for Hong Kong. In the industrial belt from\n7 to 8 kilometers from the center of Moscow, 67% of land is used by industries. (See FIGURE 1.a).\nThe extensive use of prime, centrally-located urban land for industries is particularly inefficient in\nRussia because of socialist industrial organization which requires most industries to hold large\ninventories of materials in order to survive in the socialist system. These industries therefore use large\nareas of land for warehousing and heavy transport infrastructure -- a peculiar constraint on industrial\nland use that results in a low ratio of jobs per unit of land. In a market economy, such a low job-to-land\nratio would be incompatible with the central location of these industries.\n\nThird, the distribution of jobs by distance to the city center shows that both Moscow\nand Saint Petersburg, are still monocentric cities with a high concentration of jobs in the city center, a\nfeature common with most market economy cities. (See FIGURE 1.b). As the transition to markets\nprogresses, many industrial jobs will disappear and more service jobs will be created. The majority of\nthese jobs will be located in the city center further reinforcing the monocentric characters of these cities.\nThe histograms of the geographical distribution of jobs for Moscow ( FIGURE .1.b) and Saint\nPetersburg (not shown) confirm that the industrial zones do not significantly increase the number of\n\nThe almost Dickensian character of centrally located factories in the Soviet Union and China also reflects a\nvery low rate of technological change, especially compared to those of today's \"emerging markets\" in Asia. See the\ndiscussion of high growth rates with little or zero productivity gains under central planning in Renaud, 1990.\n\njobs to justify their prime location so close to the city center. No data were available to conduct a more\ndetailed analysis of present land use and floor space. But the very high spot prices reached by new\noffice space in Moscow and Saint Petersburg are indicative of an acute supply constraint for land and\nfloor space dedicated to services in the city center, a typical shortage in socialist economies in\ntransition.\n\nFourth, obsolete forms of intercity transport further solidify this frozen land use pattern.\nThe land of the industrial belt of Moscow is serviced by a dense network of railways which have the\neffect of further fragmenting the land and making land on the exterior side of the industrial belt\nexpensive to service. Only a small part of the volume of traffic on the rail network within Moscow\nMunicipal boundary is used for passenger and commuter traffic; most of it is used for freight. This\nfragmentation further reduces the usability of land adjacent to centrally-located industrial areas and\nincreases significantly the cost of the primary infrastructure network which has to be developed to\nservice it. This fragmentation of urbanized land by railroads is linked to the Soviet Union's\nextraordinarily high dependence on rail transport compared to any other country which is nine times\nhigher than in Western Europe, and to the industrial bias of Soviet economic and urban planning. This\nproblem is encountered in most Soviet cities and other socialist economies.\n\nC.\nDynamics of Housing and Residential Development in the Socialist City\n\nThe prevalence of unrecycled large-scale industrial belts in Moscow and St. Petersburg\nis a subset of a larger set of spatial distortions found in Russian cities. The process of development of\nhousing projects under the administrative command-system and the activities of real estate developers\nin market cities follow different motivations and yields totally different outcomes from those predicted\nby market models of location and land use. The key to understanding these larger distortions also\nprovides a tool to design policies for reducing inefficiencies. In a market, housing developers are value\nmaximizers while in a supply-driven command economy bureaucratic housing builders are cost\nminimizers with little interest in final users satisfaction since these are not the direct clients which are\nother administrations.\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nINDUSTRIAL LAND USE AND JOB DENSITY PATTERNS\n\nMOSCOW - LAND USE\nJob density in Built-up Areas\nDistance from City Center (km)\nJob Density (job/hectare)\nfile:R_mblup.xls\nFigure 1.b\nMOSCOW - LAND USE\nPercentage of Industrial Land within the Built-up Area\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\nDistance from City center (km)\n% of Industrial Land within built-up Area\nfile:R_mblup.xls\nFigure 1.a\n\nIn a market economy, private developers compete for the same location. The winning\nbid will go to the activity estimated to be most profitable at that site. Land prices exert their pressure on\nthe whole supply of land, including the already built land. This is the key to economically efficient\ncities and lies at the core of our urban models. As the city expands, land prices tend to rise throughout\nthe city. Land prices stay the highest in the most accessible areas around the city center and along\ntransport corridors. This was already Von Thunen's fundamental insight. Such pricing triggers density\nincreases in those areas. The rise in density triggered by relative price changes is due to the\ncompounded effects of two phenomena: (1) Floor-to-land area ratios (FAR) increase in central\nlocations because of land recycling through demolition and reconstruction, and (2) The consumption of\nland space per job or per resident decreases because the more efficient land users out-bid less efficient\nland users who then move to more peripheral locations where land is cheaper.\n\nOver time, the interaction of these effects produces a population density profile that is\nnegatively sloped from the high-population center to the sparsely-populated periphery. The driving\nforce behind this density gradient is not master planning by city planners, but the individual decisions of\nreal estate developers who want to maximize the difference between production costs and the market\nvalue of the final product. As a city grows larger and richer, recycling land in already built-up areas\noffers the opportunity to maximize this difference. This is an incremental and decentralized process but\nit is not slow. In advanced industrial economies, about 2% to 5% of all urban jobs within an urban area\nrelocate every year, depending on economic growth conditions. In a market economy like the US,\nfamilies relocate about every five years, but 80% of moves are within the same urban area.\n\nBy contrast, under the administrative-command economy, housing construction\norganizations are typically integrated into housing kombinats and they respond to very different\nincentives. A kombinat's performance is measured by its ability to reduce input costs while meeting\nquantitative production targets. The costs have to be minimized while the value of the final product is\nirrelevant. Land may be free, but it must be allocated from what is available. Due to the lack of\nincentive for land recycling, the supply of land is limited to the new areas developed that year in the\nouter fringe. As a consequence, kombinats have to meet their production targets using land that is\nalmost exclusively at the periphery. The density of the newly built area (defined as the unit of floor\nspace divided by unit of land) will then reflect the ratio between the developed land available and the\namount of floor space to be built to meet the production quota.\n\nAs the socialist city expands, the land at the periphery becomes less and less desirable\nand more expensive to develop because primary infrastructure -- and metro lines in the case of Moscow\nand St. Petersburg -- have to be expanded. But in a command economy, housing is entirely supply-\ndriven and, if the supply of serviced land is lagging behind the floor space production target, the\nbuilding density in the outer rings will tend to rise. Over time, Soviet housing kombinats have been\nstacking up more floor space on the more distant land. The failure to price land is compounded here by\nartificially low energy prices. The dynamics of such a system do not tend to produce the resource-\npreserving, more efficient negative density gradient of market cities. 5\n\nNote that the artificially low socialist cash wage (see Renaud, 1991) compounds residential land use\ndistortions. In market cities, behavioral studies show that urban residents tend to value their time traveling to work as a\nsignificant proportion between one-third and one have of the hourly-wage equivalent of their salary (see Chapter 8 in\nMeyer and Gomez-Ibanez, 1981). In socialist cities, the distorting effects on land use allocation of the lack of land\nprices are further masked by the artificially low value that urban residents are placing on their time. Price and wage\n\nC.\nThe Socialist City Compared With the Market City: Moscow versus Paris\n\nThe comparison of density profiles between Moscow and Paris is revealing (see\nFIGURE 2.a). Both metropolitan regions have a population of about 9 million. They are strongly\nradio-concentric, and have similar peak densities. However, the way densities are distributed\ngeographically is strikingly different. Paris shows the typical density profile of a market economy city,\nwith a negatively sloped gradient. In sharp contrast, Moscow has a positively sloped density gradient.\nThe net density of Moscow at 15 kilometers from the city center is twice as high than in the center. The\ndensity of Moscow suburbs at 15 kilometers from the center is the same as in the center of Paris. One\nshould note the drop of density at 6 kilometers from the center in Moscow. This drop of density is due\nto the unrecycled industrial land use producing the enclaves of \"dead land\" in the city fabric.\n\nThe degree of population dispersion can be measured in a rough manner by comparing\nthe median distance to the center per person. FIGURE 2.b shows the cumulative population distribution\ncurve of Moscow, St. Petersburg and Paris. The cumulative curves of Moscow and Paris intersect each\nother at Kilometer 14, corresponding to a population of about 6 million people. This means that within\na circle of a 14 kilometers radius, Moscow and Paris serve the same population, and as a consequence\nhave the same average density. However, because of the difference in the density profile between the\ntwo cities, the median distance per person to the center is 7 km for Paris and 10 km for Moscow, a 42%\ngreater dispersion in the case of Moscow. Is the land use and the density profiles of socialist cities like\nMoscow or St.-Petersburg a mere curiosity for land use specialists? Emphatically not. It matters a\ngreat deal to the Russian urban economy where three-fourth of the population lives, for the following\nreasons:\n\n1. Average densities being equal, the population of a city with a positively sloped density profile is\nmore dispersed than one located in a city with a negatively sloped profile. This implies higher\ntransport costs, higher primary infrastructure costs, higher urban operating costs, and a greater share\nof labor time wasted in travel. these distortions are paid for in the form of lower levels of economic\ndevelopment.\n\n2. A large amount of floor space has been developed where there is little demand for it, that is, in the\nsuburbs with less accessibility. When transport subsidies are progressively removed and full wages\nrestored, demand -- and consequently land prices -- for this type of high density housing far from\nthe city center will drop even further. Prices could well drop below replacement costs and trigger\nabandonment.\n\n3. The fully-serviced, underused land close to the city center has a high opportunity cost.\n\nliberalization are now triggering massive shifts in relative prices that are deeply disruptive, as discussed further in Part\nIV.\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nTHE SOCIALIST CITY COMPARED TO THE MARKET CITY\n\nMoscow Compared to Paris\n\nFigure 2.a\n\nComparative density profile in the built-up areas of Moscow and Paris\nDistance from city center (km)\npopulation density (p/ha)\nMoscow\nParis\nfile:L_Budens.xls\nCOMPARATIVE POPULATION DISTRIBUTION Moscow, St.Petersburg & Paris\n-\n1,000,000\n2,000,000\n3,000,000\n4,000,000\n5,000,000\n6,000,000\n7,000,000\n8,000,000\n9,000,000\nDistance from City center (km)\nCumulative Population within km x\nMoscow\nSt.Petersburg\nParis\nfile:R_mblup.xls\nFigure 2.b\nUnrecycled land in\nIndustrial belt\n\nIII.\nEMERGING PROPERTY MARKETS AND REAL ESTATE PRICES\n\nFor seventy years, Soviet Russia has used its great natural resources to built an urban system of\ndoubtful efficiency and sustainability. More generally, the socialist city has inordinately high\ncapital/output ratios and requires more resources for less urban output that market cities. Urban land\nmarkets are therefore a very important part of overall economic reforms. The allocation of land should\nbe driven by its current opportunity cost. However, the value of a specific land parcel in its highest and\nbest use can prove difficult to estimate even in a stable fully developed urban land market. The next best\nprices are actual market transactions which are the result of private valuation of investors looking at the\nfuture and risking their own-resources. Since 1990, urban laws and constitutional reforms promoting\nindividual ownership and decisions have been enacted in Russia (Butler and O'Leary, 1994), as well as\nother socialist countries, including China (Kerzner 1993). Consistent with Kornai's insight (1990), such\nreforms were initially attempted for narrow bureaucratic reasons.\n\nA.\nSynthetic Land Price Gradients and Normative Prices\n\nDuring the late 1980's, under Gorbachev's perestroika, local governments resources\nhad become severely constrained. Local mechanisms to finance the production of serviced land had to\nbe found to complement the inadequate resource transfers from the central government. It was\ntherefore decided to create a land use tax to finance local infrastructure. In the peculiar logic of an\nadministrative-command system, officially land has no value in construction projects. Yet everyone\nagreed that different locations have very different economic values. The solution chosen was to\nestimate normative land prices on which taxes could be based. For the first time, various research\ninstitutes began building models to calculate synthetic land price maps according to which taxes would\nbe raised, and from which land price gradients could be derived. These institutes have attempted to\nmap normative values of land calculated on the basis of weighted coefficients representing amenities\nsuch as transport, infrastructure, environmental quality, etc. Typically, demand factors were not\nincluded, and price estimates were based on the arbitrary and highly distorted accounting prices of the\nlate 1980s. Regardless of these fundamental flaws, land value maps were produced from which one can\ninfer a city's normative, land price gradient.\n\nThe resulting normative land price gradients of Moscow and St. Petersburg were\nnegatively sloped. Moscow's gradient was somewhat flatter than St. Petersburg. The normative price\nvariation between the center and the periphery in Moscow was only 2.5 to 1 (from Rb 4,000 at km 0 to\nRb 1,600 at 22 km in the now irrelevant 1990 prices). Both curves are much too flat. In market cities,\nin the absence of major topographical and legal constraints, the ratio between the land price in the\ncentral business district and at the fringe of the built-up periphery is usually on the order of 10 to 1. In\nspite of their correct slope, the profile of these normative curves was highly arbitrary as nobody knew\neither the highest nor the lowest values. Such normative prices could greatly improve the traditional\nurban master plans made in Russia, but they would be of no value for the choice of a specific location\nfor a given investment.\n\nB.\nHousing Privatization and Rapidly Emerging Implicit Land Price Gradients\n\nWith the beginning of housing reforms, actual apartment sales transactions between\nprivate parties have been taking place in Moscow since 1991. Privatization and opportunities to trade\n\nunits are now rising dramatically.1/ A preliminary empirical analysis of 2,000 transactions carried in\nthe first trimester of 1992 and of another group of transactions in the fourth trimester of the same year\nprovides an important first look at emerging real estate and land prices. The study analyzed the\nresiduals from an apartment sales model that uses only building-specific variables based on resales of\nprivatized apartments. It is possible to construct a land price gradient by plotting the residual as a\nfunction of distance from the center of the city as show in FIGURE 3. These preliminary results provide\nsome critical information. First, the emerging price gradient is downward sloping from the center.\nClearly, housing kombinats are not providing the housing that household value the most. As FIGURE\n3.a shows, the land price index decreases from 100% in the center to 70% at 25 km. -- a negative price\ngradient -- with the greatest decreases coming in the first 8 km. This model suggests that, at present,\nimputed land prices are only about 1.5 times higher at the center than at 25 km. This is still a very weak\nprice differential to trigger the urban restructuring that Russian cities need. Various factors can explain\nthis flat price gradient including the collapsing economy, ambiguities about land values, and the\ndisequilibrium state of an emerging market.\n\nWhat is rather striking and unanticipated is that the land price gradient seems to be\nrotating very rapidly during the transition to market.7 The analysis for the second period in Moscow\nshows that the slope of the price gradient has steepened from 100 percent in the center to 58 percent at\nonly 15 kilometers from the center. This a real adjustment of 20 percent in less than a year. It can be\nexpected that, with new legal clarifications of land ownership rights in December 1992, privatization, as\nwell as continuing relative price changes regarding energy the gradient will continue to rotate rapidly.\nThis expectation is also fed by a similar analysis of land prices in Krakow, Poland which shows that in\nthat city the land price differential has already reached a market city differential of about 10 to 1.\nPolish urban reforms, in particular the restoration of private land ownership rights has been more\nthorough that what has been done so far in Russia. At this early stage in the development of the land\nmarket, location values are not yet being fully capitalized into property values. A more normal price\ndifferential will only emerge when investors have more certainty about land tenure, when real estate\ninformation institutions become more proficient, and when economic and political conditions stabilize.\n\n6/\n\nFor reference, it is estimated that about 125,000 housing units were exchanged or sold in 1992. Since\nthere are about 3.1 million apartments in Moscow, this represents a rate of about 4 percent of the housing stock. In a\nmarket city, the annual ratio of housing trades is often of the order of 15 percent of the stock. A major social change is\ntaking place with the rapid privatization housing units by their occupants. Between late 1992 and the end of 1993,\n35.5% of the state stock was privatized in Moscow and 26% in Russia. By the end of 1994, the share of privately\nowned Moscow units was expected to reach 55%, in dramatic contrast to a ratio of less than one percent in 1990. This\nMuscovite rate of privatization remains much higher than other cities.\nPrivatization of housing units has been particularly rapid in Moscow and St. Petersburg. By the end of\n1994. The share of privately owned units in Moscow has risen dramatically from less than one percent in 1990 to\nmore than 55 percent by the end of 1994.\n\n8/\n\nThis rapid rotation is confirmed in the analysis of different Moscow housing price data by G.S.\nMadalla, Y. Toda, and N.N. Nozdrina in \"The Price of Apartments Auctioned in Moscow: A Heeding Approach\"\n(unpublished draft paper, May 1993).\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nEMERGING MARKETS' LAND PRICE GRADIENTS\nin Moscow, Krakow, and Paris\nDistance from City Center (km)\nRelative price from center\nMoscow, 1992\nfirst quarter\nMoscow, 1992\nfourth quarter\nKrakow, Poland\nSource: Moscow, Krakow: Joseph K.

For seven decades, Soviet planners have made\nurban investment decisions under four greatly distorted prices: land had not site value, interest on\ncapital was not recognized, energy prices were only a small fraction of world prices, and cash wages\nbore no relation to the marginal productivity of labor. The emergence of markets will lead to sharp\nshifts in relative prices. In cities, the process is likely to be seriously disruptive. We can only point\nhere at some of the management issues during this transition to markets.9 What will be the outcome of\nthe interactions between the negatively sloped land price gradient with the positively sloped population\ndensity gradient? What will happen to: (1) the land occupied by existing enterprises, and (2) to the\npricing of dwelling units, both rents and sale prices?\n\nA.\nMarket Prices and Affordability of Land Currently Occupied by Enterprises\n\nLand reform administrators are presented with a difficult dilemma: if enterprises are\nasked to pay the market price (as defined above) for the land they occupy -- in the form of rent or land\nuse tax -- most of them would not be able to afford it, and some would have to be declared bankrupt.\nAlternatively, if the financially weaker enterprises are given a reprieve or a waiver on the cost of land\nthey occupy, this will perpetuate the status quo. The urban community will lose the opportunity cost of\nthe land. New infrastructure would have to be developed elsewhere, while the costly existing\ninfrastructure would remain underused. If the objective is to improve land use efficiency as rapidly as\npossible, one approach for responding to the above dilemma is to grant to existing enterprises explicit\nproperty rights in the land they now occupy. Then the enterprise will have the incentive to use this land\nas equity in planning to relocate to more affordable, appropriate land.\n\nThe value of the land resources involved in industrial land recycling -- even under the\nemerging low and still flat price gradient estimated for 1992 in FIGURE 3-- is very large. If we assume\nthat the percentage of industrial land of Moscow could be reduced from the present 32% to 10% -- still\na high ratio by international standards -- then about 100 square kilometers of already developed land\ncould be recovered. Current Russian discussions of the affordability problem of non-residential land\nare a false problem which ignores the necessity of land use transition. By definition, the market price\nof land is affordable to new users. The industrial land may not be affordable, however, to existing users\nwho are asked to pay for it retroactively, but these existing users are precisely those who are using land\nin an inefficient manner. The affordability dilemma can be solved by recognizing the land equity\ninterest of present land users and then allowing these users to trade freely the land they occupy.\n\nB.\nImpact of the Transition to Markets on Housing and Services Areas\n\nThe basic price of a housing unit depends on three main parameters: (1) location, (2)\nfloor area, and (3) land area. Households, when shopping for housing, have to make trade-offs between\nthose three parameters. For a given shelter price, suppliers are theoretically able to provide a dwelling\nunit in any location. This is possible by allocating different combinations of values to the three basic\nparameters: location, floor and land. Thus, the floor-to-land-area ratio of different housing unit types\nmay varies widely within the same city. The net land area required to build one square meter of floor\n\nFor details, see Bertaud and Renaud (1994).\n\nspace may vary from 0.10 square meter for high rise apartments to 15 square meters for detached\nhouses. Urban regulations and the many-dimensional features of housing demand impose a limit to the\ntheoretically infinite number of permutations between location, floor area and land area.\n\nWith housing privatization which has been taking place very rapidly in Moscow and St.\nPetersburg, a housing market is emerging in Russia. Households are gaining ownership interest in the\nunits they currently occupy, but different units of the housing stock at different locations within each\ncity have very different values. The larger part of the housing stock built in the periphery of Moscow\nand St. Petersburg and the 150 largest cities of Russia (nationally about 55%) consists of prefabricated,\nreinforced-concrete, large-panel, high-rise apartments of 5, 9, 12, 15 and 22 floors. The actual economic\nvalue of such units and not their resource cost will be revealed by household preferences for the first\ntime. High rise apartments at the periphery have four problems. (1) Operating and maintenance costs --\ndefined to include the cost of maintenance and operations of elevators and lift pumps, cost of central\nheating caused by the bad insulation of panel buildings, costs of frequent structural repairs required by\nthe building technology used, and the cost of maintenance of large common open space. At present,\nrents no longer cover much if anything beyond the sharply increased energy costs. (2) The space\nstandards measured according to room dimensions and height of ceiling which did not vary between\ncentral and suburban locations. (3) The quality of amenities including distance to shops and a variety of\nservices may be lower than in central locations. (4 Transport costs formerly expressed only in time to\nwork, are rising rapidly in financial terms as energy costs and other costs rise and transport subsidies\ndecrease.\n\nThe market price which will emerge as land and real estate markets develop may turn\nout to be much below the replacement cost of such a unit. Most importantly, the market price of such\nunits expressed in terms of market rent, might not even cover maintenance costs. Viewed through the\nprism of emerging market prices, much of the housing stock in periphery apartment buildings may have\na discounted present market value of less than zero -- a sobering issue for privatization policy and for\nfuture housing investment programs. In the case of Moscow, as can be seen in FIGURE 2.a , the units\nat risk would be those located in residential areas with densities above the density line for Paris between\nkilometer 9 and kilometer 22. Given the current housing shortage, transition policies of preferential\ntreatment in terms of transportation subsidies, higher quality maintenance may ease the burdens on\nresidents. But it will remain a fact that these parts of the housing stock have very low and mostly\nnegative transitory economic value. The high accessibility of some parts of the suburban areas (around\nmetro stations for instance) should provide the opportunity for the emergence of secondary\nemployment centers. Such centers would contribute to restoring the economic value of some of the\nresidential areas. For this to happen, land use regulations and local administrative practices should\nshow enough flexibility and speedy responsiveness to allow land conversion wherever firms of all\nsizes choose to use this location opportunity. Allowing this type of land use transformation to proceed\nshould be a high urban policy priority.\n\nIt should be clear from the quantitative analysis presented that the suburban housing\ncrisis which is looming in the cities of Russia cannot be attributed to the transition to markets, but to the\nlegacy of the past. This crisis is the result of the administrative-command which disregarded the\npractical needs and preferences of the final users and lacked means of self-correction. The economic\nvalue of the housing that was produced did not match the true economic cost of the resources used.\nThis cost was masked by distorted accounting prices which provided no meaningful guidance to\ndecision makers who resorted to inadequate or perverse physical and administrative criteria. The\nscissors effect between low rents and low wages on one hand, and rising operation and maintenance\ncosts on the other is not sustainable. Restoration of an economic balance could result from\n\nabandonment of the least attractive part of the stock combined with increasing crowding of remaining\nunits and much higher rent to income ratios.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe absence of land markets has profoundly impaired the ability to allocate and recycle\nurban land and has had a very negative impact on the internal efficiency, productivity, environmental\nquality, and livability of the socialist city. The extent of land use misallocation and the degree of\nrigidity encountered in the Russian economy which is by now fully urbanized is startling. The\nconsequence is that the socialist city tends to have very high capital/output ratios and consumes more\nresources per unit of output.\n\nA second important lesson of the failed socialist experiment is that the well-meaning\nattempt to socialize the collection of the land rent through public ownership and administrative\nallocation of land has not achieved the intended results. There is nothing presented in this paper that\nwould call into question the social goals of any community. Rather, it is the allocation of land by\nadministrative means in the name of equity and efficiency which has demonstrably failed on an\ninordinate scale. A broad variety of social goals can be accommodated under market conditions. Soviet\ncities remind us that what is most valuable in urban land market institutions is their ability to signal\nthrough prices how the current and future use of land is valued by individuals and society-- and to\nreveal how site valuation shifts up or down over time.\n\nFinally, the evidence suggests that the social and economic transition costs of moving to\nmarkets will be the highest in economies such as Russia that are most highly urbanized and where cities\nare moving to market during a period of sharp economic contraction. Urban reforms are particularly\nurgent and most feasible in the socialist economies of Asia where economies are growing and the\ngreatest wave of urbanization still lies ahead. In order to move to markets, the main components of the\nneeded urban reform are: clear and tradable property rights; efficient and market-oriented information\nsystems; a taxation system consistent with efficient land use; and, last but not least, the timely publicity\nand contestability of urban planning decisions (see Bertaud, Renaud, 1994).\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n1.\nBERTAUD, A.

These startup rms drove China's reform momentum; they were arguably\nthe single main source of China's growth. But their rapid emergence, Deng said,\n\"was not something I had thought about. Nor had the other comrades. This\nsurprised us.\" The reformers had not foreseen the key to their own reforms. The\nother excommunist economies had similar experiences. As in China, new rms\nwere drivers of reform. They strengthened the budding market economy by creat\ning jobs, supplying consumer goods, mobilizing savings and ending the state rms'\nmonopoly. As in China, also, the reformers usually did not anticipate the force of\nentry.\nOf the two routes to a private sector--privatizing the existing rms and\ncreating new ones--the policy debates focused almost exclusively on the former.\nLittle attention was given to what reform policies would foster entry. Dusan Triska,\nfor example, the architect of Czechoslovakia's privatization program, said priva\ntization \"is not just one of the many items on the economic program. It is the\ntransformation itself \" (Nellis, 2001, p. 32). It is not surprising that those who had\nspent their lives under central planning did not foresee the impact of entrepre\nneurship, but few analysts from the West predicted it either.\nThe reason for underestimating entrepreneurship, perhaps, was a sense that\nsetting up a business, risky anywhere, is especially risky in an economy undergoing\ny John McMillan is Professor of Economics, Graduate School of Business, Stanford Univer\nsity, Stanford, California.

With prices volatile as a result of the reforms, it is unclear which lines\nof business are going to be the most protable. State rms, fearing competition,\nharass the new rms, and corrupt bureaucrats extort bribes. Without the normal\nmarketsupporting institutions, the new rms usually cannot rely on the courts to\nenforce their contracts; bank loans are unobtainable for most; and there is little\nlegal or regulatory provision for shareholding.\nThese handicaps notwithstanding, large parts of the new market economy\narose spontaneously, through the initiatives of entrepreneurs. They succeeded by\nselfhelp: they built for themselves substitutes for the missing institutions. Reputa\ntional incentives substituted for court enforcement of contracts. Trade credit (loans\nfrom rm to rm along the supply chain) substituted for bank credit. Reinvestment\nof pro ts substituted for outside equity.\nIn this paper, we summarize entrepreneurial patterns in the transition econ\nomies, particularly Russia, China, Poland and Vietnam.1 Markets developed spon\ntaneously in every transition country, but they were built at varying speeds. Some\ngovernments impeded the entrepreneurs' selfhelp by creating conditions that\nmade it hard for informal contracting to work; others created an environment that\nwas conducive to selfhelp. The spontaneous emergence of markets, furthermore,\nhas its limits. As rms' activities became more complex, they came to need formal\ninstitutions. Some governments fostered entrepreneurship by building market\nsupporting infrastructure; others did not (Frye and Shleifer, 1997). We will argue\nthat the success or failure of a transition economy can be traced in large part to the\nperformance of its entrepreneurs.\nThe Environment for Entrepreneurship\nAll the transition economies, from the former Soviet Union and central and\neastern Europe to China and Vietnam, were similar in one important respect: their\nplanned economies had been dominated by large rms, producing few consumer\ngoods. Small and mediumsized rms were almost nonexistent, although they are a\nlarge part of every market economy. Trade and services were also a much smaller\npart of the transition economies than is typical for a market economy. As reform led\nto greater exibility in prices, wages and production decisions, the imbalances\ninherited from the planned economy created enormous pro t opportunities for\nentrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs responded by starting enterprises at a rapid--\nthough varying--rate in each of the transition countries.\nSome governments actively made it hard for entrepreneurs to operate. Expro\npriation of pro ts through ofcial corruption was the most conspicuous of such\nactions. Managers of startup manufacturing rms were asked in a survey whether\n\"extralegal\" payments were needed in order to receive government services or a\n1 Our focus will be on the state's role in encouraging startup rms, not on efforts to create a market\nsector by revamping the old state rms; on that issue, see Djankov and Murrell (2002), Megginson and\nNetter (2001) and Nellis (2001).\n\nJohn McMillan and Christopher Woodruff\nbusiness license ( Johnson, McMillan and Woodruff, 2002b). More than 90 percent\nof Russian managers said they were, compared with about 20 percent of Polish\nmanagers. Corruption deters investment. Those rms in the sample that were the\nmost concerned about corruption invested nearly 40 percent less than those least\nconcerned. The ma a is a further deterrent to entrepreneurship. Asked whether\npayments to private agencies were necessary for \"protection\" of their activities,\nmore than 90 percent of Russian managers and 8 percent of Polish managers said\nthey were.\nManagers were asked in the same survey whether they would invest $100 today\nif they expected to receive $200 in two years (an implied annual rate of return of\n40 percent). The responses to this question give an indication of both the oppor\ntunity cost of money and the security of property. A striking 99 percent of the\nRussian managers said they would not, compared with 22 percent of the Polish\nmanagers.\nIllegitimate takings aside, ofcial policies often make it expensive to set up\nrms. Entrepreneurs must apply for business licenses to establish that their com\npany's name is unique and provide proof of their startup capital; then they must le\nwith the tax and labor authorities. In Russia, setting up a new business takes an\nentrepreneur over two months and costs 38 percent of per capita GDP in of cial\nfees (Djankov et al., 2002). In Poland, it takes nearly a month and costs 28 percent\nof per capita GDP. In Vietnam, it takes nearly six months and costs a striking\n150 percent of per capita GDP.\nThe government's decisions on privatizing state rms may also have affected\nthe environment for new rms. Mass privatization could add to the general uncer\ntainty, thus deterring entry. Across Russia's regions, more new rms have been\nformed where there was less privatization of small state enterprises, though more\nentry has occurred where there was more privatization of largescale state enter\nprises (Berkowitz and Holland, 2001). The continued presence of state enterprises\nalso raised barriers to entry. They absorbed scarce capital and received regulatory\nfavors (as did the privatized rms). Anecdotes abound of state rms sti ing new\nentrants to prevent them from becoming competitors.\nNot only did governments impede entrepreneurship, formal institutions to\nunderpin entrepreneurial activity developed only slowly. In Vietnam in the mid\n1990s, for example, after a decade of reform, the market institutions were still\ninadequate. Banks almost exclusively served stateowned rms. There were no\ncreditreporting bureaus. Courts able to enforce contracts between private rms\nwere just being created. Among manufacturers we surveyed between 1995 and\n1997, less than 10 percent said that courts or the government could enforce a\ncontract with a buyer or seller, and just 10 percent said that they had received credit\nfrom banks when they started their business (McMillan and Woodruff, 1999b). In\nanother survey carried out in 1997, 74 percent of private rms reported having no\ndebts to banks, and such debts represented only 20 percent of the capital among\nthe 24 percent of the rms that did have them (Ronnas, 1998).\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nPro ts and Entry\nFour transition countries, Poland, Russia, China and Vietnam, span the range\nof entrepreneurship patterns. Poland was among the most successful in fostering\nnew private rms. Russia was among the least successful, though entry occurred\neven there. China took a distinctive path with entry of competitive enterprises run\nby local governments. Vietnam offers an example of robust growth of private rms\neven with an almost total absence of formal institutions to facilitate business.\nA telling measure of the success of a transition economy's reforms is the time\npath of entrants' prots. Figure 1 shows the path of pro ts in the ve years\nfollowing the start of transition in China (1979-1984) and in Poland and Russia\n(1990-1995). In China, at the start of the reform era in 1979, the average pro ts\nof nonstate rms were 28 percent of invested capital. This is very high in compar\nison to earnings in a mature market economy: small businesses in the United States\ntypically earn returns between 9 percent and 15 percent of assets.2 As China's\ntransition proceeded, the new rms' prots declined steadily through the rst\ndecade of reform, falling to 15 percent of invested capital in 1984 and leveling out\nat 6 percent in 1991 (Naughton, 1995, p. 150).\nIn Poland, pro t rates of manufacturing rms in their rst year of operation\nfell from an average of 25 percent of invested capital for rms formed in 1990 to\n6 percent for rms formed in 1995. In Russia, also, pro ts earned by entrants were\nhigh at the start of the reforms: rms established in 1990 earned an average pro t\nof 17 percent on invested capital in their rst year of operation. By contrast with\nChina and Poland, however, prots did not decline over time: rstyear pro ts for\nrms established in 1995, at 16 percent, were almost as high as those for the rms\nestablished in 1990 ( Johnson, McMillan and Woodruff, 2002b).3\nThe high pro ts earned in all three countries early in the transition are easily\nexplained. The starting point was a heavily distorted economy with un lled market\nniches. Firms that were able to overcome the impediments to doing business and\nproduce and sell goods and services were very pro table. In Poland and China, as\nmarketsupporting institutions developed, the impediments declined and so rents\n2 The U.S. data are from the National Survey of Small Business Finances (Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors, 1994). The NSSBF sampled 273 manufacturing rms with between 10 and 250 employees.\nThe return on invested capital averages 15 percent. However, in the surveys of rms in the ve eastern\nEuropean countries, prots as a percentage of assets were obtained in categories, with the lowest\ncategory being \"negative\" and the highest category being \"41 percent or greater.\" When these categories\nare used with the U.S. data, the average return on invested capital is 9 percent rather than 15 percent.\nIt is likely, then, that the data from Poland and Russia discussed in this section understate somewhat the\nreturn to capital.\n3 A word of caution about comparing the prot data from China on the one hand and Russia and Poland\non the other: The Polish and Russian data are from surveys of about 300 manufactur ers in each country\nin 1997 ( Johnson, McMillan and Woodruff, 2002b). Firms were asked about prots in their rst year of\noperation. Figure 1 shows the average prot rate of rms beginning operation in each year. As such, they\nare subject to possible recall and selection bias. The China data were gathered contemporaneously from\nrms operating at the time.\n\nThe Central Role of Entrepreneurs in Transition Economies\nFigure 1\nTime Path of Pro ts\nNotes: The horizontal axis shows the number of years into reform. For China, year 1 means 1979 and\nyear 6 means 1984. For Poland and Russia, year 1 means 1990 and year 6 means 1995.\nSources: China: Naughton (1996, p. 150). Poland and Russia: Johnson, McMillan and Woodruff\n(2002b).\nfell. Russia's stalled transition shows up in the absence of any decline in pro t\nlevels.\nData on the rate of entry of new rms are consistent with the pro t paths\nshown in Figure 1. Entry occurred rapidly in China. Most of the new entrants there\nwere not private rms, but rural enterprises run by local governments, called\ntownship and village enterprises. The share of China's industrial output accounted\nfor by rural enterprises increased from 9 percent in 1978 to 30 percent in 1991\n(Naughton, 1995, p. 164). Since none of the increase in output of rural rms in\nChina came from privatized state rms, all of it is attributable to newly formed\nrms. The entry of these new enterprises was driven by the extraordinarily high\nrates of pro t available early in the reforms. The competition engendered by rapid\nentry was the primary cause of the fall in prots.\nEntry in Poland was also rapid. Industrial employment in Poland's private\nsector rms increased from 15 percent in 1991 to 37 percent in 1994, according to\nKonings, Lehmann and Schaffer (1996), using data collected by the Polish Central\nStatistical Ofce. The 21percentagepoint increase was apparently largely the result\nof new entrants, since privatized rms represented only 6 percent of industrial\nemployment in 1994. At least onesixth of industrial employment in Poland in 1994,\nthen, was in de novo rms (\"de novo\" meaning started from scratch rather than\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nbeing spun off from stateowned rms). The level of selfemployment in Poland\nincreased from 6 percent of the labor force in 1988 to 12 percent in 1993\n(according to Earle and Sakova, 1999, using labor market surveys).4 Although most\nof the rmlevel studies in transition countries focus on manufacturing, entry may\nhave been even more important in the service sector, given the underdevelopment\nof the service sector in the centrally planned economies. In Poland, the service\nsector grew from 40 percent of nonagricultural GDP in 1989 to 66 percent of GDP\nin 1997.\nRussia, by contrast, saw less rapid entry. A 1995 study found that just 6 percent\nof manufacturing employment was in de novo rms (Richter and Shaffer, 1996).\nSelfemployment in Russia in the early years of the transition increased only from\n2 percent of the labor force in 1988 to 3 percent in 1993 (Earle and Sakova, 1999).\nCon rmation of the slowness of entry comes from data collected by Djankov and\nNenova (2001) on employment in manufacturing rms with fewer than 50 employ\nees in 1997. Since small rms were uncommon in the planned economy, small size\nis a rough proxy for de novo startups. They nd that small rms represented\n24 percent of manufacturing employment in Poland, but only 10 percent in Russia,\nand that the employment share of small rms in the Russian service sector more\nthan doubled from 13 percent in 1989 to 30 percent in 1997.5 All data on\nincreasing shares in Russia need to be interpreted in the context of a shrinking\neconomy. For example, Russia also saw services increase from 40 percent of the\nnonagricultural economy in 1989 to 62 percent in 1997. The share of services\nincreased in spite of the fact that output of services actually declined by 1 percent\nper year during the 1990s; manufacturing declined much more rapidly.\nThe speed of entry in China, Poland and Russia was consistent with the time\npath of pro ts shown in Figure 1. Robust entry in China and Poland brought\nplummeting pro ts. In Russia, entry was slower, and pro ts remained high.\nIn Vietnam, also, the available data indicate that entry of private rms was\nrobust (though we are unaware of any prot data there). Vietnam is an intriguing\nexample, for it is an extreme case in its lack of formal marketsupporting institu\ntions. Yet Vietnam's private sector boomed. The number of registered private rms\ngrew by 40 percent per year between 1993 and 1997. Private sector employment\ngrew from 3.8 million to 10.2 million between 1988 and 1992, while employment in\nstate rms fell from 4.1 million to 3.0 million and in cooperatives fell from\n20.7 million to 18.6 million. In the following three years, from 1992 to 1995, private\n4 The labor survey data indicate that the majority of the selfemployed work for their own account. These\nworkers may represent not robust entry, but desperation in the face of unemployment (Earle and\nSakova, 2000). Nevertheless, in 1993, over 4 percent of Poland's workforce were selfemployed people\nwho also hired others, a level much higher than in the other transition countries examined by Earle and\nSakova.\n5 Djankov and Nenova (2001) data also show that employment in small rms grew rapidly in Poland\nduring the 1990s, from an average of 8 percent in 1990 -1992 to 23 percent in 1996 -1998. (Comparable\ndata for Russia are not available.) For Russia, small manufacturing rms are dened as those with fewer\nthan 100 employees, rather than 50, as in Poland, hence the difference between Poland and Russia is\nunderstated. The service sector data for Russia and Poland are from the World Development Indicators\ndatabase.\n\nJohn McMillan and Christopher Woodruff\nsector employment grew by more than 2.4 million, during which time state sector\nemployment remained constant.6 Substantially all of this private sector growth\ncame from new entry or expansion of household enterprises, mostly retail and\nrepair shops or small manufacturing enterprises. Vietnam has had no formal\nprogram of privatization. Though there were some ad hoc spinoffs from state\nowned rms, these represent a minority of the private rms. For example, only\n6 percent of rms we surveyed in 1995 said that more than half of their equipment\ncame from stateowned rms (McMillan and Woodruff, 1999b).\nEntry was robust, then, in Poland, Vietnam and, in its own way, in China, while\nit was comparatively weak in Russia. Other transition countries saw entry to varying\ndegrees. Ukraine and the rest of the former Soviet Union were like Russia, for\nexample, whereas Slovakia was more like Poland. Pro ts were high early in the\ntransition because the inefciencies of the planned economy left unsatis ed de\nmands and un lled market niches. Where reform was successful, it brought com\npetitive markets, eroding prots. Where it was less successful, the entrants' pro ts\nremained high.\nEntrepreneurs' Strategies\nIn the early years of economic transition, the absence of credit markets, courts\nand other market institutions created substantial impediments to entry. Potential\nentrants had to nd money with which to purchase equipment and inputs. They\nhad to identify reliable suppliers and customers when most rms were new and\nlittle information was available. The unusually high pro t rates early in the transi\ntion provided a strong incentive for entrepreneurs. But what substituted for the\nmissing formal institutions?\nHow did the entrepreneurs succeed in overcoming the lack of market\nsupporting institutions? Ongoing relationships among rms substituted for the\nmissing institutions. Firms relied on the logic of the incentives to cooperate that\narise in playing a repeated game. Where courts and laws are unreliable for settling\ndisputes, rms trust their customers to pay their bills and their suppliers to deliver\nquality goods out of the prospect of future business. Interviews with Vietnamese\nmanagers, for example, indicate that they think quite consciously in terms of\nbuilding relationships with specic customers and suppliers (McMillan and\nWoodruff, 1999a).7\nEarly in the process of transition, repeated game incentives work especially\n6 Registration data are from McKenzie (2000); employment data from Wolff (1999, p. 63). Joint ventures\nbetween state rms and foreign investors are included in the state sector. Beginning in 1993, statistics\nfor collectives and private rms were combined. The increase of 2.4 million jobs is for private rms and\ncollectives combined; however, it is reasonable to presume that collectives continued to decline (their\noutput shrank from 2.7 percent of GDP in 1992 to 0.8 percent in 1998), meaning the employment\nincrease is attributable to private rms.\n7 On the interaction between formal and informal contracting mechanisms, see Baker, Gibbons and\nMurphy (1994).\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nwell. When it is hard to locate alternative trading partners, because rms are scarce\nor market information is inadequate or transport costs are high, rms make efforts\nto maintain their existing relationships. They recognize that they are to some\nextent locked in with their trading partners, which provides an incentive to behave\ncooperatively (Kranton, 1996; Ramey and Watson, 2001). The evidence we present\nin this section suggests that selfenforcing contracts are all that is needed to support\na lot of entrepreneurship, especially at the start of the reforms.\nEvidence from Vietnam is especially pertinent here, since formal institutions\nwere almost nonexistent for some years after its transition began. Consider access\nto capital. Even in developed market economies, a major source of capital for small\nand mediumsized rms is trade credit from suppliers. The lack of formal nancial\nmarkets meant that credit from suppliers was even more important to private sector\nrms in transition countries. In 53 percent of the relationships between the\nmanufactures we surveyed and their customers, some portion of the bill was paid on\ncredit. That suppliers were willing to offer credit in the absence of formal enforce\nment of contracts is noteworthy. What gave the suppliers con dence that they\nwould be paid? The willingness to sell goods on credit depended upon repeated\ninteractions, according to the managers we surveyed (McMillan and Woodruff,\n1999a). Trading relationships most often began with cash transactions, as the\npartners \"tested\" each other. Firms got contractual assurance by dealing with rms\nthey knew through having dealt with them before.\nInformally enforced trade rests on the shadow of the future. A rm lives up to\nits agreements because it wants to go on doing business with this trading partner.\nFor the future to weigh heavily enough to induce cooperative behavior, the\ndiscounted value of the future prot stream must outweigh whatever immediate\npro ts could be squeezed from the deal. Some of the conditions in the transition\neconomies actually worked against cooperation. The scarcity of credit meant the\nopportunity cost of capital was high. With high discount rates, rms have an\nincentive to take current prots rather than wait for future pro ts. Moreover, as we\nsaw, pro ts tended to decline over time. To the extent that this was predictable, the\ngains from forwardlooking behavior were lowered. That rms were nevertheless\nable to operate mutually benecial relationships is striking.\nOther circumstances of the transition aided informal contracting. Cooperation\nis easier to sustain when severing the relationship results in higher costs. Early in\nthe transition, trading partners were most often located in the same city or even the\nsame neighborhood. There were usually few rms nearby producing any given\nproduct. When a supplier severed a relationship with a customer, the customer had\nto incur a high cost of searching for another trading partner. As a result, trading\npartners tended to be locked in with each other, inducing them to try to sustain\ntheir existing relationships (Kranton, 1996; Ramey and Watson, 2001).\nCooperation is more easily sustained, also, if punishment for malfeasance\ncomes not only from the trading partner who has been cheated but also from other\nrms in the community. We found that gossip was important in Vietnam's manu\nfacturing community. Firms gathered information about potential or existing\ntrading partners from other rms. Sometimes this information gathering was\n\nThe Central Role of Entrepreneurs in Transition Economies\norganized. Trade associations helped rms to work productively with each other, by\nspreading information about who had breached contracts and coordinating the\nsanctioning of them. This meant that reneging brought more severe consequences\nthan merely losing the business of the offended party and thus increased the\nlikelihood of cooperation (McMillan and Woodruff, 2000; Recanatini and Ryter\nman, 2000).\nThe selfhelp mechanisms evolved over time to support more complex trans\nactions. Early in the transition, rms sold mostly to customers located in the same\ncity or limited sales to customers about whom they had prior information from\nfamily members, friends or other rms with whom they did business. They were\nlikely to inspect a customer's factory or store before selling to it. These are ways to\nreduce the risk of dealing with new trading partners, though they involve costs of\nexclusion or of time spent investigating trading partners. Relationships with rms\nlocated in distant cities are harder to manage than local sales, but limiting the circle\nof trading partners means passing up some opportunities for growth. Sales to\ncustomers located in other cities, and to customers about whom the manufacturer\nhad no prior information, became more common as the transition progressed.\nTable 1 illustrates these changes using data from surveys in three transition\ncountries, Vietnam, Poland and Russia. The surveys asked rms about the charac\nteristics of their oldest and newest customer relationships. The table splits relation\nships into those that began earlier and later in the transition. Relationships labeled\n\"old\" are those begun in the rst six years of reform, before 1993 in Vietnam and\nbefore 1995 in Poland and Russia, while those labeled \"new\" were formed between\n1994 and 1997 in Vietnam and between mid1995 and 1997 in Poland and Russia.\nAll of the variables shown on Table 1 are measured at the start of the relationship\nand, as such, are indicators of the formation of new relationships rather than the\ndevelopment of the specic bilateral relationships.\nThese data show statistically signicant increases in transactions with custom\ners from other cities, with customers about whom nothing was known at the start of\nthe relationship, and in relationships that were initiated without the seller having\nvisited the buyer's factory or store. In Poland, for example, 35 percent of the\ncustomer relationships started by surveyed rms between 1989 and mid1995\ninvolved customers from a different city, compared with 45 percent of relationships\nstarted in 1995 or after. About 39 percent of the newer customers in Poland were\nanonymous when the trading relationship began, compared with 27 percent of the\nolder customers. Trading started in 38 percent of the new Polish relationships\nwithout the seller visiting the buyer's facility, compared with 29 percent of the older\nrelationships.\nThe patterns in the other countries are similar, both for Vietnam and Russia,\nas shown in the table, and for Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine, which are not shown.\nFurther evidence on the increase over time in the sophistication of dealings comes\nfrom Bulgaria, where quality incentives developed. Suppliers became increasingly\nwilling to guarantee quality and to replace substandard goods based on their\ntrading relationships (Koford and Miller, 1998).\nThese data suggest that the problems of governing more complex relationships\n\nOld\n28.8%\n31.8%\n57.6%\nn.a.\nn.a.\n36.6%\n30.8%\nTable 1\nDevelopment of Relationships with Trading Partners\nVietnam\nRelationships\nPoland\nRelationships\nRussia\nRelationships\nNew\nOld\nNew\nOld\nNew\nLocated in a different city\n38.9%\n35.0%\n45.0%\n14.5%\n(2.27)\n(2.40)\n(3.44)\nPreviously unknown\n65.5%\n27.0%\n38.9%\n(1.74)\n(2.94)\nDid not visit before rst\n50.5%\n28.8%\n37.5%\n35.3%\ntransaction\n(3.00)\n(2.16)\n(0.70)\nNumber of rms\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nNotes: Old relationships are those initiated prior to 1993 in Vietnam and prior to 1995 in Poland and\nRussia.

Receiving no help from the state,\nentrepreneurs made do for themselves, by relying on the incentives that arise in\nongoing relationships. Repeated games substituted for the courts; trade credit and\npro t reinvestment substituted for nancial markets. The mechanism of selfhelp\nsupported increasingly sophisticated transactions--at least in the early years of\ntransition.\nState Support for Entrepreneurship\nSelfhelp in creating market institutions is not a permanent solution for\nentrepreneurs. It faces a number of natural limits.\nFirst, the development of the market as the transition proceeds lowers the costs\nof searching out new trading partners, which weakens a rm's threat to cut off\ndealings if a trading partner reneges on a deal. The cost of breaking a relationship\nfalls. Firms then become less willing to cooperate with each other, and the need for\nworkable laws of contract and courts able to enforce them becomes more pressing.\nSecond, repeated games entail personalized inter rm relationships. When\nrms are small, they need only deal with customers and suppliers with whom they\nhave a particular connection: those located nearby, or managed by a friend or\nrelative, or coming via personal recommendations. Firms were able to some extent\nto overcome these limitations, as noted above: even in Vietnam, they were able to\ntrade at a distance. Such informal mechanisms are limited, however. To grow\nbeyond a certain size, rms need to manage armslength anonymous dealings: for\nexample, to begin trading with rms in distant cities rather than just with\n\nJohn McMillan and Christopher Woodruff\ngeographically nearby rms. Anonymous trades need a greater extent of formal\ncontractual assurance.\nThird, as products become more complex, there is an increased need to order\nthem, and to commit to buy them, in advance of production. Without the courts,\nsuppliers may be unwilling to switch to producing complex goods and services.\nFourth, although rms can for a while grow incrementally by investing their\nretained earnings, they reach a point where, to take advantage of economies of\nscale, they must make big discrete jumps in their investments. Having a long\ndelayed return, such investments are unlikely to be made on the basis of ongoing\nrelationships. Sunk costs tempt someone to renege: a purchaser after the costs are\nsunk may renegotiate the buying price, or the government after the costs are sunk\nmay impose a speci c tax. Largescale investments require legal protection.\nFinally, as pro ts decline through the process of economic transition, while\ninvestments often become larger and longer term, rms can rely less on retained\nearnings to grow and increasingly need access to external nance.\nA role for the government, even early in the transition, is to set a stable\nplatform for entrepreneurs' selfhelp. Macroeconomic instability, common at the\nbeginning of a reform program, can undermine informal cooperation. Consider a\ntrading relationship in which the seller allows the buyer to pay with a 30day delay.\nIn stable times, the ability to delay payment has a predictable value to the buyer and\ncost to the seller. The value of continuing the relationship is also predictable. The\nlevel of credit offered can be set in such a way that repayment is in the seller's\ninterest. But now suppose that, after the goods are delivered by the seller, there is\nsome unforeseen shock that increases the value to the buyer of not making the\nrequired payment and affects only the trading partners' current payoffs, not the\nstream of future gains from the relationship (such as a sharp decrease in bank\ncredit or a rapid decline in the buyer's demand). If the shock makes the gains from\nreneging large enough, the buyer will not pay.8\nRisks were inherent in any trading relationship in all of the transition coun\ntries, but the policies of some governments magni ed them. Unstable macroeco\nnomic conditions made it harder to predict the behavior of trading partners. High\nand variable rates of in ation and economic growth led to uctuations in a trading\npartner's gain from breaking the cooperative relationship. Macroeconomic stability\nwas conducive to the development of informal trading relationships. On this score,\ncountries like Slovakia, where in ation peaked in 1991 at 35 percent, and Poland,\nwhere in ation peaked in 1990 at 75 percent, fared well. Russia and Ukraine, where\nprice stability was longer in coming, fared worse. Of course, the lack of entry in\nRussia and Ukraine may have contributed to macroeconomic instability as well as\nthe other way around. We know of no data that would allow us to separate the\n8 The situation we have in mind is similar to the Rotemberg and Saloner's (1986) model of price wars\nduring economic booms. In their model, collusion is most likely to break down in a boom when the\ndemand for the product is high, because that is when an individual seller's gain from undercutting the\ngroupmaximizing price is highest. Hence, collusion is harder to sustain in industries with more variable\ndemand.\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\ndirections of causation. But given the importance of informal trading arrangements\nearly in the transition, theory suggests that, by making relationships harder to\nestablish, macroeconomic instability created a barrier to entry.\nWhile contracting is mainly supported by informal relationships among rms,\nthe courts also foster it. The courts in the transition economies are still inadequate;\nit takes a long time to build a wellfunctioning legal system. The evidence shows,\nhowever, that even these highly imperfect courts facilitate doing business. Manag\ners of startup rms were asked in a 1997 survey whether they could appeal to the\ncourts to enforce a contract with a trading partner. In Poland, 73 percent said they\ncould, and in Russia, 56 percent said they could. Belief in the courts affects\nbehavior. Those who say the courts are effective offer more trade credit and are\nmore willing to take on new trading partners ( Johnson, McMillan and Woodruff,\n2002a; see also Frye and Shleifer, 1997; Hendley, Murrell and Ryterman, 1999). By\nmaking it easier for new rms to enter, workable courts improve on relational\ncontracting and boost overall productivity. Even weak courts can be useful.\nThe absence of wellfunctioning credit markets matters less early in transition\nthan later. In place of external funds, rms reinvest from their own pro ts. The\nhigh pro ts mean that entrepreneurs have the resources they need for expansion,\nwithout needing to borrow. Retained earnings has been the biggest single source of\ninvestible funds for startup rms in transition economies. In addition, where\ninter rm relationships are working well, rms receive trade credit from their\nsuppliers. Trade credit was almost nonexistent among Russian rms as of 1997, but\nin Poland it was as large a source of rms' capital as bank loans ( Johnson, McMillan\nand Woodruff, 2002b). As entry occurs and pro t rates are driven downward,\nhowever, credit markets become more important. In Vietnam, there is some\nevidence that credit markets were beginning to reach new private rms: 24 percent\nof rms in a 1997 survey reported having bank credit, up from 8 percent in 1991\n(Hemlin, Ramamurthy and Ronnas, 1998).\nAn alternative source of capital is equity markets. State support is needed for\nan equity market to develop. In Poland, a regulatory agency that intervened to\nprotect minority shareholders from expropriation by insiders allowed the stock\nmarket to develop rapidly (Glaeser, Johnson and Shleifer, 2001). New issues were\noffered regularly. In the Czech Republic, by contrast, the absence of regulatory\noversight meant people were, rightly, reluctant to invest in rms because they\nfeared the managers would misuse their money, and so the stock market stayed\ninactive. Why is regulation needed for equity markets? Informal creation of share\nownership is dif cult. Fixed costs of issuing shares to a large group of investors\nprevent a slow buildup of the relationship, with investors testing entrepreneurs as\ntrading partners in Vietnam reported doing. Because outside shareholders lack\ninformation on the rm's internal affairs, managers can easily expropriate the\nreturns owed to the shareholders ( Johnson and Shleifer, 2001). Prospective share\nholders need legal and regulatory protection before they are willing to hand their\nmoney over to rms.\nEntrepreneurs running de novo startups in Poland reported that an average of\n25 percent of their equity capital was owned by private rms or people other than\n\nThe Central Role of Entrepreneurs in Transition Economies\nthe top manager's family. This is a somewhat higher level of outside ownership than\nother countries for which such data are available: Vietnam, at 19 percent, Slovakia,\n19 percent, and Romania, 14 percent ( Johnson, McMillan and Woodruff, 2000;\nMcMillan and Woodruff, 1999b). The lesson, once again, is that informal mecha\nnisms work only up to a point. Investors are willing to entrust their money to\nmanagers they have some reason to believe in, perhaps because of ties of family or\nethnicity or because the manager comes recommended by a trusted third party.\nLarge rms with diversied shareholding cannot develop by such informal mech\nanisms, but some degree of outside ownership can.\nEvidence that selfhelp mechanisms in nancial markets have limits comes\nfrom Earle and Sakova's (2000) study of entrepreneurship in Poland, Russia and\nfour other eastern European countries. Employers, as compared to wage workers,\nare more likely to have received property during posttransition restitution and to\nhave had higher earnings in 1988. Also, the parents of those who became employers\nwere more likely to have owned a business prior to communism and more likely to\nhave had a university degree than are the parents of wage workers. These ndings\nsuggest that access to capital was a binding constraint on entry, one not entirely\novercome by informal credit.\nChina did things differently with its new rms. Entry occurred in the non\nstandard form of the township and village enterprises (Che and Qian, 1998;\nWhiting, 1996). These rms were publicly owned, by communities of a few thou\nsand people. They were managed by village government, and the pro ts were\nshared between villagers and local government by explicit rules. Around 60 percent\nof pro ts were reinvested, and the remainder was paid as bonuses to workers or\nused for local public goods such as education, roads and irrigation. Managerial\ndiscipline in the township and village enterprises came from the fact that these\nenterprises had no access to government subsidies to cover any losses and faced\nintensely competitive product markets.\nThe township and village enterprises received some bene ts from having the\nvillage government as a partner. Access to state banks and to rationed inputs was\neased. Public ownership helped remedy the lack of laws protecting against arbitrary\nexpropriation by the state, as well as helping with contract enforcement. Moreover,\nChina's local governments, arguably, did not sabotage their township and village\nenterprises by overtaxing them because they could see that if they did, the rms\nwould fail and their own revenue source would be lost.\nThe township and village enterprise organizational form was a transitional\ndevice. After a decade and a half of growth, they began to be privatized. By the late\n1990s, more than half of them were partially or fully privately owned (Li and\nRozelle, 2000). By the turn of the century, the township and village enterprises were\nwell on their way to becoming conventional rms.\nEntrepreneurs require more from the state, in the medium and long run, than\nthe absence of interference. If rms are to be able to grow to yield economies of\nscale, they need laws of contract so they can take on anonymous dealings and\nnancial regulation so they can get bank loans and outside shareholding.\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nWelfare Effects of Entrepreneurship\nThe creation of jobs has been arguably the most important welfare bene t of\nthe new entrants. Given the distortions and inef ciencies in the communist\nplanned economy, the old rms had to shed jobs during the transition, and new\nentrants were needed to take up the slack. New rms have usually been the\nfastestgrowing segment in transition economies. In Poland and in Russia, de novo\nmanufacturing rms grew faster, invested at a higher rate and generated faster\nemployment growth than did privatized rms (Belka et al., 1995; Richter and\nSchaffer, 1996; Johnson, McMillan and Woodruff, 2000). In Vietnam, the private\nsector created (in net terms) some 10 million jobs in the seven years from the start\nof reforms, while the stateowned and collective rms shed workers.\nThis pattern is repeated in most of the transition economies for which data\nexist. In Estonia, small privately owned rms--mostly startups-- created almost all\nof the new jobs between 1989 and 1994 (Haltiwanger and Vodopivec, 2000). In\nRomania, 86 percent of de novo manufacturing rms created jobs between 1994\nand 1996, while only 13 percent of privatized rms did so. In Slovakia, 79 percent\nof de novo rms grew, against 52 percent of privatized rms ( Johnson, McMillan\nand Woodruff, 2000). De novo rms in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania between\n1990 and 1996 grew more quickly than did privatized or stateowned rms (Bilsen\nand Konings, 1998). Though de novo rms represented less than 3 percent of\nemployment in the samples in Bulgaria and Romania, they created more than half\nof the new jobs. In a sample of rms from 25 transition countries, Carlin et al.\n(2001) nd that sales and employment grow faster in de novo rms than in\nprivatized or state rms; they also nd that productivity gains are smaller, probably\nre ecting that new rms start at a higher level of ef ciency than the state rms and\nthus have less room for productivity growth.\nThe key difference does not seem to be between stateowned and private rms,\nbut rather that de novo rms outgrew all other rms. Many studies nd little\ndifference between the performance of stateowned rms and privatized rms. The\nnding that de novo rms perform better than privatized and stateowned rms is\nnot quite universal, however. The Johnson, McMillan and Woodruff (2000) data\nshow essentially no difference in the growth rates of startups and privatized rms in\nRussia and Ukraine. Lizal and Svejnar (2001) nd that the rates of investment of\nprivate rms in the Czech Republic were somewhat lower on average than those of\nstateowned rms in the 1992-1998 time period and that small rms in the Czech\nRepublic were credit constrained while large rms were not (which may explain in\npart their rst nding). Taken as a whole, then, the evidence indicates that de novo\nrms were more dynamic than privatized state rms, except perhaps where the\nlatter had favored access to capital.\nEntrepreneurial rms provide other benets. Small new rms are dynamic.\nThey learn and change rapidly, and thus they provide a large number of indepen\ndent experiments on how to do business. One measure of this dynamism is their job\nchurning. In a study of Estonia, Haltiwanger and Vodopivec (2000) separate the net\nchange in employment into the creation of new jobs by expanding rms and the\n\nJohn McMillan and Christopher Woodruff\ndestruction of existing jobs by shrinking rms. For stateowned rms, in the rst\nhalf of the 1990s, job creation was small and job destruction among these enter\nprises was large. In the private sector, there was a lot of job creation. Yet, surpris\ningly, the private sector also had higher rates of job destruction than the state\nenterprise sector. These data indicate more ux in the private sector, with some\nrms expanding rapidly and others contracting. The simultaneous high rates of job\ncreation and job destruction were especially pronounced among the smallest rms,\nthose with fewer than 20 workers. This could be attributable to learning by the small\nrms, which is especially important in the transition setting, where costs and\ndemands are subject to far wider uncertainty than in a stable economy.\nNew rms also provide competitive discipline for the preexisting rms. State\nowned and privatized rms in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are\nsignicantly more likely to have undergone restructuring if they faced competition\n(Carlin et al., 2001; Djankov and Murrell, 2002). In China through the 1980s, while the\ntownship and village enterprises burgeoned, the state rms' markup of price over\nmarginal cost fell by 15 percent; the increased competitiveness of the output market\nwas associated with an increased total factor productivity for the state rms (Li, 1997).\nThere is some evidence, also, that a transition economy's overall performance\nis correlated with entry. Comparing economic growth rates of the different regions\nof Russia, Berkowitz and DeJong (2001) nd that the fastergrowing regions have\nmore entry of new rms.\nImplications for Policy\nIn the early 1990s, a common view among those advising the reforming\ncountries was that the overriding objective was to get the government out of the\neconomy. Once the prohibitions on market activity were abolished, the argument\nwent, the private sector would quickly take over. Later, in light of the grim\nperformance of Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union, this simple view was\nsupplanted by a recognition that reforming an economy is exceedingly hard.\nSuccess requires a complex package of microeconomic reform, macroeconomic\nstability and institution building.\nOur analysis speaks to both views. On the one hand, it says there is something\nin the leaveittothemarket view. Protdriven entrepreneurs can do a remarkable\namount, even to the extent of creating temporary replacements for the key social\ninstitutions of property rights and contract.\nOn the other hand, our analysis says getting the government out achieves its\naim only in a narrow set of circumstances. The selfhelp substitutes for market\nsupporting institutions work well only for rms that are small. Larger rms, dealing\nwith many suppliers and customers and trading at a distance, cannot rely solely on\npersonalized relationships to undergird their transactions. Formal institutions are\nneeded, therefore, both by privatized rms and, after a while, by startup rms if\nthey are to grow to an efcient scale. Moreover, government policy does matter\neven at the level of the small startups, for the business environment must be\n\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\nreasonably stable and predictable if the shadow of the future is to give rms reason\nto be able to trust each other. If you keep your word only because of the prospect\nof future gains, you are more likely to renege when the business environment is very\nnoisy. Corrupt bureaucrats and politicians, by extorting bribes, discourage entre\npreneurs from investing ( Johnson, McMillan and Woodruff, 2002b). High and\nvolatile in ation could undermine rms' attempts at selfhelp contracting. Mass\nprivatization, by adding to the uncertainty about which lines of business are going\nto be pro table, might disrupt the nascent interrm relationships.\nThe same ambivalence between the force of informal mechanisms and their\nlimits, by the way, is seen in many developing countries. In Africa and Latin\nAmerica, rms lacking access to the courts engage in a remarkable range of\nproductive activity (de Soto, 1989; Fafchamps, 2001; Woodruff, 1998). The lack of\nmarketsupporting institutions, however, makes it hard or impossible for these\nrms to grow into sophisticated corporations.\nThe economic transition has been far more painful in some excommunist\ncountries than in others. Relative success came in those countries where new\nmarket activities were quickly established. Ironically, and contrary to the leaveit\ntothemarket view, markets arose faster where the government did not completely\nwithdraw, but rather set a stable platform. New rms entered and grew more slowly\nin Russia, where the government abruptly ceased controlling prices and rapidly\nprivatized the state rms, than in China, where the government mostly continued\ndoing what it had been doing before. 9\nConclusion\nThe importance of entrepreneurs in the transition economies is a reminder\nthat the task of economic transition is not just a matter of government of cials\nenacting certain policies or setting certain rules of operation for the new\neconomy. Entrepreneurs acted as reformers, too. Indeed, much of the task of\ndevising the new ways of doing business in transition economies has been taken\non by entrepreneurs.\n\"By pursuing his own interest,\" Adam Smith (1776 [1976], volume 1, pp.\n477-78) famously wrote of the merchant, \"he frequently promotes that of society\nmore effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\" The entrepreneurs in\nthe transition countries exemplify Smith's dictum. By creating jobs, supplying\nconsumer goods, constraining the market power of the state rms and building\nreform momentum, they have produced real welfare gains.\ny We thank David Ahn, Simon Board, Simeon Djankov, Brad De Long, John Earle, Alan\nKrueger, Barry Naughton, Timothy Taylor and Michael Waldman for helpful comments.\nMcMillan thanks the Stanford Graduate School of Business for research support.\n9 On the parallel roles of bottomup and topdown forces in developing market rules and procedures,\nsee McMillan (2002).\n\nThe Central Role of Entrepreneurs in Transition Economies\nReferences\nBaker, George, Robert Gibbons and Kevin J.\nMurphy. 1994. \"Subjective Performance Mea\nsures in Optimal Incentive Contracts.\" Quarterly\nJournal of Economics. 109:4, pp. 1125-156.\nBelka, Marek et al. 1995. \"Enterprise Adjust\nment in Poland: Evidence from a Survey of 200\nPrivate, Privatized, and StateOwned Firms.\"\nCentre for Economic Performance Discussion\nPaper No. 233, April.\nBerkowitz, Daniel and David DeJong. 2001.\n\"Entrepreneurship and PostSocialist Growth.\"\nWilliam Davidson Institute Working Paper No.\n406.\nBerkowitz,\nDaniel and\nJonathan Holland.\n2001. \"Does Privatizatio n Enhance or Deter\nSmall Enterprise Formation?\" Economics Letters.\n74:1, pp. 53- 60.\nBilsen, Valentijn and Jozef Konings. 1998.\n\"Job Creation, Job Destruction and Growth of\nNewly Established, Privatized and StateOwned\nEnterprises in Transition Economies: Survey\nEvidence from Bulgaria, Hungary and Roma\nnia.\" Journal of Comparative Economics. 26:3, pp.\n429- 45.\nBrown, David and John Earle. 2001. \"Privatiza\ntion, Competition, and Reform Strategies: The\nory and Evidence from Russian Enterprise Panel\nData.\" SITE Working Paper No. 159, Stockholm\nSchool of Economics.\nCarlin, Wendy et al. 2001. \"Competition and\nEnterprise Performance in Transition Econo\nmies: Evidence from a CrossCountry Survey.\"\nCEPR Discussion Paper No. 2840.\nChe, Jiahua and Yingyi Qian. 1998. \"Institu\ntional Environment, Community Government,\nand Corporate Governance: Understanding\nChina's Township Village Enterprises.\" Journal\nof Law, Economics, and Organization. 14:1, pp.1-\n23.\nde Soto, Hernando. 1989.
