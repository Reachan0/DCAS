Also, radon\nmay not be entering the building at a\nconstant rate, for example with intermittent\nventilation or movement in the building.\nAlso, the RDPs that are getting generated\ninside the building, part of them may be\nsuspended in the air within, some percentage\nmay settle on the surfaces.\n\nJanuary 17, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 1: P. ILA\n4. Dynamic Equilibrium ...\nOnce the radon entry rate into a building\nchanges, time is needed for radon and RDP\nlevels to stabilize. Otherwise their\nconcentrations may be constantly changing.\n12 hours is normally sufficient time frame for\nreaching the dynamic equilibrium. Dynamic\nequilibrium is the steady state of radon and\nRDP levels within the environment.\n\nJanuary 17, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nJanuary 17, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 1: P. ILA\nSession 1: P.

Radon Geology\nStudies of the geology of radon mainly consist:\ndistribution of uranium and radon sources in\nrocks and soils,\nradon formation and movement in rocks and\nsoils,\nradon entry into buildings from the soil and\nwater.\nRef:\nOtton, J. K., Gundersen, L. C. S., Schumann, R. R., The Geology of Radon,\nhttp://energy.cr.usgs.gov/radon/radonhome.html;http://energy.cr.usgs.gov/radon/georad\non/3.html\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.1 Distribution of uranium and radon\nsources in rocks and soils\nUranium: The source\nTo understand the geology of radon - focus on\n3⁄4 location of formation,\n3⁄4 way of formation ,\n3⁄4 way of transportation .\nBut always first\nbegin with its parent source URANIUM.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.1 Distribution of uranium and radon\nsources in rocks and soils ...\nURANIUM - The Parent\n3⁄4 Uranium is a primordial element.\n3⁄4 Uranium exists in almost all rocks.\n3⁄4 Uranium in most rocks may be in small levels -\n1 and 3 parts per million (ppm) of uranium.\n3⁄4 Uranium content of a soil is dependent on the\nuranium content of the parent rock.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.1 Distribution of uranium and radon\nsources in rocks and soils ...\nUranium in rocks\n\nUranium may be higher than average range of 1-3 ppm in some rocks.\n\nThese consist of:\nvolcanic rocks,\ngranites,\ndark shales,\nsedimentary rocks that contain phosphate,\nmetamorphic rocks\nSedimentary rocks, some for example:\nAbout 300 ppm of U in phosphorites,\nAbout 20-30 ppm of U in bentonites and bauxites\nMetamorphic rocks:\nMetamorphic means altered or changed.\nMetamorphic rocks may be derived from the above rock types.\n\nLayers of rocks high in uranium are beneath various parts of the United States.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.1 Distribution of uranium and radon\nsources in rocks and soils ...\nUranium in rocks ...\nExpectation\nHigher uranium level in an area leads to higher levels of\nindoor radon - usual expectation.\nHowever\nSome houses on uranium-rich soils have low levels\nof indoor radon.\nSome houses on uranium-poor soils have high levels\nof indoor radon.\nHence\nAdditional factors affect the indoor radon levels in\naddition to uranium beneath the soil.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\nHouse - Soil - Air Radon\nFigure by courtesy of USGS\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.2 Formation and movement of\nradon in rocks and soils\nRadon formation\nUranium is present in all rocks and soils.\nRadium and radon are daughter products\nare formed by the radioactive decay of\nuranium.\nSo they are present too!!!\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.2 Formation and movement of\nradon in rocks and soils ...\nRadon formation ...\n\"Each atom of radium decays by ejecting from its nucleus an\nalpha particle composed of two neutrons and two protons. As the\nalpha particle is ejected, the newly formed radon atom recoils in\nthe opposite direction, just as a high-powered rifle recoils when a\nbullet is fired.\"\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.2 Formation and movement of\nradon in rocks and soils ...\nRadon formation ...\nRadon atoms are generated by the decay of radium.\nBut all radon atoms may not enter the pore space between the\nmineral grains where radium is located in the rock (or soil).\nThe chances of the newly created radon atoms entering the pore\nspaces of the grains depend\nnot only on the proximity of the radium atom\nto the surface mineral grain\nbut also on the direction of the recoil of the radon atom\ntoward the surface of the grain.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.2 Formation and movement of\nradon in rocks and soils ...\nRadon formation ...\nUnsuccessful\n1) Location deep within the big grain:\nWhen radium atoms are present deep within a big\ngrain, then direction of recoil of radon atom has no\neffect, the radon atoms will remain embedded in the\nmineral. Radon from the grain will not escape outside,\ninto the pores,\n2) Direction of recoil toward the grain's core:\nWhen the direction of recoil is toward the grain's core,\nthe recoil will send the radon atom deeper into the\nmineral, even when a radium atom is near the surface\nof a grain.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.2 Formation and movement of\nradon in rocks and soils ...\nRadon formation ...\nSuccessful\n1) Recoil of some radon atoms directed toward\nthe grains core;\n2) Radium atoms are near the surface of a grain.\nWhen this happens, the newly formed radon leaves the\nmineral and has a chance to enter the pore space\nbetween the grains or the fractures in the rocks.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.2 Formation and movement of\nradon in rocks and soils ...\nRadon formation ...\n\nAlpha recoil is the most important factor affecting the release of\nradon from mineral grains.\n\nThe recoil of the radon atom is strong reaction. Most of the times,\nthe newly formed radon atoms enter a pore space, cross all the\nway through the pore space, and become lodged in nearby\nmineral grains.\n\nIf the pore space contains water, the radon atom slows\nvery quickly and is more likely to stay in the pore space.\n\n10 % - 50 % of the radon produced actually escapes from the\nmineral grains and enters the pores, for most soils.\n\nMost soils in USA contain between\n0.33 and 1 pCi of radium per gram of mineral matter\n200 - 2,000 pCi of radon per liter of soil air\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.2 Formation and movement of\nradon in rocks and soils ...\nRadon Movement ...\nRadon is a gas, so\ngreater mobility than uranium and radium\nfixed in rocks and soils.\nRadon is a gas, so\n\neasier movement away from the rocks and soils\n\neasier escape into\nfractures and openings in rocks\npore spaces between grains of soil.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.2 Formation and movement of\nradon in rocks and soils ...\nRadon Movement ...\nThe parameters of radon's movement through soils:\nMOISTURE CONTENT:\nThe amount of water present in the pore space\nPOROSITY:\nThe percentage of pore space in the soil.\nPERMEABILITY:\nThe \"interconnectedness\" of the pore spaces that\ndetermines the soil's ability to transmit water and air.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.2 Formation and movement of\nradon in rocks and soils ...\nRadon Movement ...\nRadon can move through cracks in rocks and\nthrough pore spaces in soils.\nRadon moves more rapidly\nthrough permeable soils,\nsuch as coarse sand and gravel,\nthan through impermeable soils,\nsuch as clays.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.2 Formation and movement of\nradon in rocks and soils ...\nRadon Movement ...\nRadon moves slower in water than radon in air.\nFor example, before it completely decays, radon moves\n< 1\" in water-saturated rocks or soil,\n> 6' - tens of feet in dry rocks or soils.\nThe reason for this is, mainly that, water moves slowly\nthrough soil pores and rock fractures than does air.\nBefore its complete decay, radon travels shorter distances\nin wet soils than in dry soils.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.2 Formation and movement of\nradon in rocks and soils ...\nRadon Movement ...\nReasons for high indoor radon\n\nDrier, highly permeable soils,\nbedrock such as\nhill slopes, mouths and bottoms of canyons,\ncoarse glacial deposits, and fractured\nor cavernous bedrock,\ncontribute to high levels of indoor radon.\n\nEven, \"normal\" range (200-2,000 pCi/L,\nwith high permeability of these areas\ncontribute to high levels of indoor radon.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\nRadon movement\nFractured bedrock\nLimestone\nFractured Clay\nSand and Silt\nSand and Gravel\nFigure by courtesy of USGS\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.3 Radon entry from soil and water\nsystem into buildings\nRadon Entry Into Buildings\nRadon gas usually escapes into the atmosphere after the\nformation in the soil and rock; while moving through soil pore\nSpaces of the soil and fractures of the rocks near the surface of\nthe earth as shown in the figure labeled Radon Movement.\nHowever, the reasons for soil air flow toward a house foundation\nare:\n\ndifferential air pressure between the soil and the house,\n\nThe existence of openings in the foundation of the house,\n\nincreased in permeability around the basement if present.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.3 Radon entry from soil and water\nsystem into buildings\nRadon Entry Into Buildings ...\nAir pressure around most houses is often\n> Air pressure inside the house.\nAir moves easily from the gravel bed into the house\nthrough openings in the house's foundation.\nAll house foundations have openings :\n- cracks,\n- utility entries,\n- seams between foundation materials,\n- uncovered soil in crawl spaces,\n- unfinished basements.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.3 Radon entry from the soil and the\nwater system into buildings ...\nRadon Entry Into Buildings ...\nOut door radon is generally quite low.\nMost houses draw < 1% of their indoor air from the soil; the\nremainder comes from outdoor air.\nMost houses draw < 20 % of their indoor air from the soil,\nwith low indoor air pressures, poorly sealed foundations,\nand several other entry points for soil air.\nHence, even if the soil air is only at moderate levels of radon,\nlevels inside the house may be very high.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.3 Radon entry from soil and water\nsystem into buildings ...\nRadon Entry Through Water\nRadon can also enter home through the water system.\n\nMost of the radon escapes into the atmosphere, so water\nin rivers and reservoirs contains very little radon.\n\nSo those who use surface water, do not face a radon\nproblem from their water usually.\n\nCity water processing is done by large municipal systems,\naerating the water, allowing radon to escape, and delaying\nthe use of water until most of the remaining radon has\ndecayed.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n1.3 Radon entry from soil and water\nsystem into buildings ...\nRadon Entry Through Water\n\nElevated levels of radon in ground water will be seen in areas of\nuranium-rich soils and rocks such granites in various parts of the United\nStates.\n\nThe small public water works and private domestic wells with closed\nsystems and short transit times do not remove radon from the water or\nallow enough time for complete decay.\n\nIn such cases, when people take showers, wash clothes or dishes, or\notherwise use water, radon escapes from the water to the indoor air.\n\nA very rough rule of thumb for estimating the contribution of radon in\ndomestic water to indoor air radon is that\n\nWater with 10,000 pCi/L of radon : 1 pCi/L of radon in the indoor air.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P.

Some examples of recent radon\nresearch in rocks and soils\n2.1 Emanation of Radon-222 from soils,\nsub soils and sedimentary rocks.\n2.2 Transportation parameters of radon:\ndiffusion, viscous flow and type of soil,\nrelationship to indoor air quality\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n2.1. Research on radon emanations\nRadon emanation depends on soil type and surface\nuranium concentration.\nThe emanation power of soil increases with moisture.\nFor water content above 10% the radon emanation\npower of soil is about twice as high as for dry soil.\nMedian values observed are:\n0.2 for dry soils and stones,\n0.06 for sand,\n0.025 for bricks,\n0.006 for ceramic tiles,\n0.008 for mineral slag,\n0.3 for gypsum.\nRef:\nBossew, P.,\nResearch on the radon emanation power of building materials, soils and rocks\nAppl Radiat Isot. 59(5-6):389-92, Nov-Dec 2003.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P. ILA\n2.2 Indoor radon - Transport parameters\nRadon gas concentrations in dwelling areas are dependent on\n\nradon concentrations in soil pores\n\nthe radium content of the soil,\n\nemanating power for radium,\n\nsoil moisture content.\nThe transport of radon from soil to the indoor living space depends on radon\ngas\n\ndiffusion and viscous flow in the soil\n\ntransfer rate to the building interior\n\naccumulation in cavities and cracks below and surrounding areas of the\nfoundations of buildings.\n\natmospheric pressure fluctuation,\n\nthermal gradients in fractured rocks, and\n\nair instabilities due to temperature differences allow air of high radon\ncontent to reach living space in dwellings in\n\nadditionally any emanation which comes directly from building materials\n\nand any other sources\nRef:\nWilkening M.,Radon transport in soil and its relation to indoor radioactivity.\nSci Total Environ. 45:219-26, 1985.\nNazaroff WW.,Radon transport from soil to air,\nReviews of Geophysics 30(2): 137-160, 1992.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P.

ILA\n2.5 Indoor radon in volcanic region -\nSpain\nObservation:\nHigher radon levels are found in houses built on the volcanic region\nthan dwellings on non-volcanic area.\nFacts:\n\nThe soil of the area is not particularly uranium-rich.\n\nSome of the volcanic materials present very high permeability\nand therefore radon entering the houses might have moved long\ndistances.\nPossible explanation after the research study:\nRadon may be possibly coming from the degassification of\nmantle through active faults.\nRef:\nBaixeras, C.; Bach, J.; Amgarou, K.; Moreno, V.\nRadon levels in the volcanic region of La Garrotxa, Spain,\nRadiation Measurements, 40(2-6):509-12; Nov 2005.\n\nJanuary 18, 2007: IAP 2007: 12.091\nSession 2: P.

ILA\n2. Recent Research on Effects of\nLow Dose Ionizing Radiation ...\nThe most important aspect of radiation protection is : to provide\nprotection, from low as well as high levels of ionizing radiation, to\nprofessionals as well as general public.\nMany risk estimate studies are based on earlier studies such as\nionizing radiation effects due to atom bomb exposure; uranium\nmining; recent studies such as exposure due to nuclear power\nplant accidents. Also many cohort studies are being conducted\nworld wide. (Ref. BEIR Reports).\nHowever, recently, there is a debate/dialogue going on about\ndamage to the human cells causing non-cancerous\neffects;\nno-damage and/or ability of cells to repair from damage;\nno effects for certain dose levels;\nfrom low dose ionizing radiations.\n\nJanuary 19, 2007: IAP 2007:\n12.091 Session 3: P. ILA\nThe dialogue about the\nappropriateness of LNT in radiation\nprotection\nAccording to 'in favor' discussion: (Ref: Brenner. D., 2001)\nLow dose range may be considered as 10 - 100 mGy.\nAt this level, there is difficulty in measuring the signals with sufficient the\nprecision and accuracy .\nYes, there may be three-four options of (non-linear) in the dose-response\nrelationships.\nThe reason that could give solid weight to 'in-favor' scenario:\nIonizing radiation energy deposition is of unique nature; when dose is\ndecreased, fewer cells may be hit by more than one radiation track\nwhich may be sufficient to damage cells, even at very low doses.\nQuoting Dr. Brenner, to sum up:\n\"A risk not statistically distinguishable from background is not in itself\nevidence that the risk is or is not zero, so is not evidence for or against\nthe applicability of LNT.\"\n\nJanuary 19, 2007: IAP 2007:\n12.091 Session 3: P. ILA\nThe dialogue about the appropriateness\nof LNT in radiation protection\nOpposing the LNT: (Ref. Raabe, O.G., 2001):\nThe LNT model uses simple mathematical relationships\nthat prorate higher dose-response down to lower and\nzero dose and risk. This is inappropriate in the\ncontext of current understanding of cancer risk\nestimates which showed non-linear threshold like\nphenomenon for ionizing alpha radiation. Also,\nstudies of beneficial effects of low level ionizing\nradiation are now being reported frequently\n(Luckey 1991, Jaworowski, 1995, Cohen 1995).\n\nJanuary 19, 2007: IAP 2007:\n12.091 Session 3: P.

      "content": "Radiation in Building Materials\nReport\nIAP 2007 12.091 Assignment\nDepartment of Earth Atmospheric & Planetary Sciences\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA\nJan 25, 2007\nKatharine Chu\n\nIntroduction:\nAfter years of studies and experiments scientists know that Radon is everywhere\nbut found in high concentrations particularly in rocks and soil enriched in uranium\nMany of these rocks and soils are treated and compacted to create everyday\nbuilding materials that are found in homes in which we live and work. A new\ngeneration of studies has been developed to try and calculate how much and\nwhat type of radiation people are exposed to in their homes when certain building\nmaterials are used and the materials people can use to lower their exposure to\nradiation.\nHow to Measure Radiation:\nResearch is currently being pursued by scientists all over the world on the\namount of radiation people are exposed to living in certain situations. Since this\nresearch is being pursued by scientists all over the world and the conditions are\ndifferent from person to person, room to room, house to house, city to city, and\ncountry to country, several precautions have to be taken when interpreting such\n\ndata. One of the easiest ways to measure and interpret the data is by measuring\nthe amount of radiation that is just in the surrounding background and using that\ninformation as a baseline. Then subtracting the radiation baseline you are able\nto see how much radiation is actually found in a house using certain radioactive\nmaterials and compare that figure to a house that uses normal building materials.\nThe size of each room created must be extremely accurate and the amount of\npressure in case must also be the same. The building materials must be used in\nthe same way as the way the building materials will be used by builders. All of\nthese factors will contribute greatly to the findings of each experiment.\nZircon Glazed Tiles:\nMany tiles are glazed with a material called zircon which contains Ra-226 and\nTh-232. Zircon glazed tiles contains 17,500 Bg/kg which is over 106 times the\namount of radiation from normal building materials. The dose rate of gamma\nradiation is measured at a distance of 5cm away from zircon and sand piles.\nAfter comparing this data with the baseline, scientists determined that rooms with\nzircon glazed tiles created 1.5 times as much ionizing radiation as rooms without\nthe zircon glazing. It is now believed that beta radiation given off from zircon\nglazing is one of the leading reasons as to why the general public is now\nexposed to more and more ionizing radiation everyday.\n\nRadon Dose from Clay Bricks:\nScientists measured the Radon-222 dose from clay bricks by using cellulose\nnitrate films to measure radiation activity inside houses. Unlike certain granite\n\nbricks which emanate radiation from the inside of the material, scientists found\nthat clay bricks emanate radiation only from the surface layers. After multiple\nmeasurements scientists have found that the average radiation for a room built\nwith clay brick ranges around 22 mBq and a closed vessel made out of clay brick\nis around 40 mBq.\nRadon Emanation from Building Materials:\nSmall scale experiments have been used to find out how much radon is\nemanated from popular building materials such as red brick, clay brick, granite,\nand sand brick. From this experiment, scientists determined that back scatter\nwas very important in determining the amount of radiation a person is exposed to\nbecause certain rooms had a smaller amount of measurable radiation than the\ninitial emanation of radiation from the building material. By finding the initial\nemanation rate and multiplying it by a diffusion coefficient determined by the\ngeometry of the room, scientists were able to find how much radiation was\nemanated from each material in different sized and shaped rooms.\n\nRadon Transport in Concrete in Relation to Moisture\nAfter many experiments, scientists have determined that radon transport in\nconcrete depends on moisture in the environment. Radon release rates seemed\nto increase linearly with moisture rates from 50-60%. However the moisture\nreached a maximum at 70-80%, and the transport rates decreased dramatically\nafterwards when applied to a slab of concrete 20cm thick. This experiment gives\ncritical information to builders to see how thick of concrete to use in different\n\nclimates to prevent radon gas from seeping through the concrete and entering\nthe house.\nConclusion:\nAll of these experiments provide critical information to different builders and\nhome buyers by educating them about choices they can make to create a safer\nliving environment for themselves. Other factors should be taken into\nconsideration such as how much time people spend indoors and how much of a\nbenefit there is to using certain materials and whether or not it outweighs the\ndangers of using certain radioactive materials. As technology becomes more\nand more advanced and more information is uncovered about radiation,\nproducers and consumers will be able to create a better and safer world for us all.\nReferences:\n1) Radioactivity in zircon building tiles,\nDeng W.
