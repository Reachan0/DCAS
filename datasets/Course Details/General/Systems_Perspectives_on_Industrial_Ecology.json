  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nOverview\n\nEngineers can fundamentally change the environmental footprint of modernity. To effect change, engineers require tools to identify \"better\" design and operational options. This course examines the use of life-cycle thinking and assessment tools to identify product and system design options that balance environmental and economic performance.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nESD.10 or 3.56.\n\nReadings\n\nBecause the course covers a broad range of topics, there is no textbook. Students will be expected to consult the assigned readings, lecture notes, and other handouts.\n\nCoursework\n\nStudents are expected complete the homework assignments. Additionally, students will work in teams on two unit projects, producing a case study report and in-class presentation for each.\n\nGrading\n\nGrades will be based on various assignments throughout the term. Their approximate weights are:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nAssignments\n\n35%\n\nCase 1 Presentation / Report\n\n20%\n\nCase 2 Presentation / Report\n\n30%\n\nClass Participation\n\n15%\n\nThe final grade will be modulated by an appreciation of the participant's progress throughout the semester, giving extra weight to those that finish strongly and demonstrate that they have mastered the material, in the end.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nAbsences\n\nStudents are expected to complete all assignments on time. Unexcused late assignments will be marked down. Reasonable excuses (sickness, unavoidable professional absences, family emergencies, etc.) will of course be accepted when presented near the event.\n\nWork in Teams\n\nStudents will likely work in teams for the unit projects. Indeed, we encourage this collaboration because it can lead to more interesting results. We require each student to turn in individually written interpretations of the common analysis.\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nTo avoid any potential confusion that might result from different expectations in other courses or establishments, please note the standards that apply in this subject:\n\nAnyone found cheating during the in-class exam will receive a zero for the exercise.\n\nAssignments turned in for grading are to be done individually, although it is expected that students will discuss the issues involved in problem sets and often learn best collectively. In practice this means that students may lead each other to the proper understanding of the material, and collaborate on setting up computer runs, but should ultimately prepare reports for each assignment individually, in their own format and words. Demonstrated evidence of copying (exactly the same presentations, same wording of sentences, etc.) will result in zeros for each paper with this evidence.\n\nClass Schedule\n\nLec #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nIntroduction\n\nPart 1: Views on Industrial Ecology\n\nWhat is Industrial Ecology?\n\nAssignment 1 due\n\nEnvironmental Paradigm\n\nAssignment 2 due\n\nSustainability: Concepts and Metrics\n\nResource Economics\n\nResource Economics (cont.)\n\nResource Econ Group Presentations\n\nAssignment 3 due\n\nPart 2: LCA: Method Basics\n\nLife-cycle Assessment - Overview\n\nUsing the Software\n\nLCA - Scope\n\nLCA - Inventory\n\nLCA - Inventory Allocation\n\nAssignment 4 due\n\nLCA - Recycling\n\nMaterials Flow Analysis\n\nPart 3: Environmental Evaluation and Advanced Methods\n\nOverview of Case 2\n\nLCA - Impact Assessment - EPS\n\nLCA - Impact Assessment - EcoPoints\n\nLCA Research\n\nCase 1 Presentations\n\nPart 4: Aggregate Materials Flows\n\nNational Materials Flows\n\nMaterial Flow Case Study\n\nPart 5: Environmental Policy Strategies\n\nEnvironmental Policy Making (Part 1)\n\nEnvironmental Policy Making (Part 2)\n\nIndustrial Ecology Research @ MIT\n\nFinal Presentations",

Life expectancy across the globe has shot up\nover the course of the last two centuries. People are better fed, better clothed,\nand better housed today than ever before. Inflation-adjusted prices for\nvirtually all resources - renewable and nonrenewable - are going\ndown, which points to growing abundance, not growing scarcity. Global\nforests have, on balance, expanded over the past 50 years. Air and water\npollution in the most industrialized nations of the world is a mere\nshadow of what it was decades ago. Even Third World countries have\nfound that, once per capita income reaches a certain point,\neconomic growth coincides with a cleaner environment. And if\ncurrent trends in productivity, population growth, and consumption continue,\nwe'll be able to return a chunk of land the size of the Amazonian Basin back\nto nature by 2070. The human footprint on the environment is\nindeed becoming lighter and softer.\n-- Jerry Taylor, Cato Institute\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nESD.123/3.560: Industrial Ecology - Systems Perspectives\nEngineering Systems Division\nRandolph Kirchain\nDepartment of Materials Science & Engineering\nIntroduction: Slide 5\nExternality Control / Environmental Protection\n- Earth is an open system.\n- Waste and pollution can pose a problem\n- Waste and pollution are economic externalities.\n- Environmental problems are failures in the economic\nsystem.\n- Sustainability is not a concern\n- Future can be protected by interventions in the\nmarket.\n- Policy strategy\n- Technological optimism\n- Pollution reduction and control through laws and\nregulations.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nESD.123/3.560: Industrial Ecology - Systems Perspectives\nEngineering Systems Division\nRandolph Kirchain\nDepartment of Materials Science & Engineering\nIntroduction: Slide 6\n\nResource Management\n- Earth is a closed economic system.\n- Exhaustion of resources is a matter of concern\n- Mismanagement of resources is an externality to be\ninternalized.\n- Sustainability (weak) means maintaining the combined stock of\nhuman and natural capital\n- Ecology poses a necessary constraint on growth\n- Policy strategy\n- Technological optimism/clean technology\n- Economize ecology\n- Correct market incentives / Get the price right..\n- Incorporate all types of capital & resources into calculations for\ninvestment planning\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nESD.123/3.560: Industrial Ecology - Systems Perspectives\nEngineering Systems Division\nRandolph Kirchain\nDepartment of Materials Science & Engineering\nIntroduction: Slide 7\nIndustrial Ecology / Eco-development\n- Earth is a closed ecological system.\n- scale / type of development = long-term survival\n- Human society and natural ecosystems have co-evolved.\n- Nature has intrinsic value, revealed through economic activity.\n- Sustainability = maintain stocks of both human and natural capital\n- Decoupling of biophysical from economic growth - steady flow\n- Policy strategy\n- \"Ecologize economy\"\n- Moral/ethical transformation to instill environmental concerns.\n- Technological realism;\nprecautionary principle to handle uncertainty.\n- Life cycle framework; product policy, \"Pollution prevention pays\"\n- Policy equity\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nESD.123/3.560: Industrial Ecology - Systems Perspectives\nEngineering Systems Division\nRandolph Kirchain\nDepartment of Materials Science & Engineering\nIntroduction: Slide 8\n\nDeep Ecology\n- Earth is a closed system.\n- Human society and natural ecosystems have co-evolved.\n- Nature has value and a .right. to exist independent of human\nclaims of hegemony.\n- Nature.s intrinsic value is hidden by economic activity.\n- Sustainability is the wrong question as it comes out of human\ncenteredness.\n- Policy strategy\n- Human transformation of .self. to realize a harmony with\nnature.\n- Technological pessimism; the value of technological innovation\nmust be proven.\n- Level of economic activity ultimately consistent with solar\ninputs.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nESD.123/3.560: Industrial Ecology - Systems Perspectives\nEngineering Systems Division\nRandolph Kirchain\nDepartment of Materials Science & Engineering\nIntroduction: Slide 9\nAnother perspective on paradigms:\nCultural Theory*\n- \"Group\" perspective, extent\nAsymmetrical\nto which an individual is\nInteractions\nincorporated (or perceives\nincorporation) into bounded\nunits\n- Greater incorporation Æ\nFatalist\nHierarchist\nsubordination of individual\nCompetition\nGroup\nCompetition\nto whole\nGrid\nFettered\nUnfettered\n- \"Grid\" perspective, extent to\nwhich individual is\ninfluenced by externally\nimposed prescriptions\nEgalitarian\n- Greater influence Æ less\nIndividualist\nperceived ability to\nnegotiate individual\nsolutions\nSymmetrical\n- Controllable / controlled\nInteractions\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nESD.123/3.560: Industrial Ecology - Systems Perspectives\nEngineering Systems Division\nRandolph Kirchain\nDepartment of Materials Science & Engineering\nIntroduction: Slide 10\n*M.
