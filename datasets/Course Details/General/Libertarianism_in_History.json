  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThere are no prerequisites for this course.\n\nCourse Description\n\nThe will to live free of the control of the state (or of organized groups who have coopted state authority) is one of the most powerful and controversial motors of western history. This course explores the history of the ideal of personal freedom with an eye towards contemporary debates over the pros and cons of the regulatory state. The first part of the course explores the sociological and theological sources of the concept of freedom and introduces liberty's leading relatives or competitors: Property, equality, community, and republicanism. Part Two consists of a series of case studies in the rise of modern liberty and libertarianism: The abolition of slavery, the struggle for religious freedom, and the twentieth-century American civil liberties movement. In the last part of the course, we take up debates over the role of libertarianism vs. the regulatory state in a variety of contexts: Counter-terrorism, health care, the financial markets, and the Internet. Throughout, students are asked to consider two problems: (1) The tension between liberty or libertarianism as a general philosophy of life and the need for context-specific judgments about that philosophy; and (2) What points those opposing or favoring broadly libertarian visions are not hearing or fully comprehending. Readings are drawn from political philosophy, sociology, history, and law.\n\nThe basic objectives of the course are twofold: To familiarize students with the varieties of libertarianism and their histories, and to enable students to argue effectively about libertarianism on several different levels. Libertarianism has historical, political-theoretical, and policy dimensions (among others), and by the end of the course students should be able to assess and critique the claims made both for and against libertarianism on all three of these levels. The claims in question are often controversial, and they are a constant presence in political, legal, and social argument. The course should help students to engage in oral debate over these issues, and then also to write about them reflectively and with the benefit of historical perspective.\n\nRequired Texts\n\nThere is one text required for this course:\n\nSandel, Michael J., ed.\nJustice: A Reader\n. Oxford University Press, 2007. ISBN: 9780195335125. [Preview with\nGoogle Books\n]\n\nAll other readings can be found in the\nReadings\nsection.\n\nCourse Format, Assignments, and Evaluation\n\nThe class meets twice a week. The first twenty or so minutes of each meeting will consist of lecture-style introductions to the day's topic. The remainder of each class will be devoted to group discussion of the assigned texts for that day.\n\nRegular attendance and participation in class discussions are expected. Students will be asked to demonstrate their engagement with the texts primarily by way of participation in our group discussions, but also by means of two kinds of supplementary exercises. First, students will be asked on a few occasions to post brief responses to the readings on the class website during the course of the semester (roughly one for each part of the course, for a total of three).\n\nSecond, we will hold two in-class debates during the course of the semester.\n\nFinally, the course assignments include two papers. The first is a paper of 8-10 pages on a topic relating to the history and political theory of liberty as an ideal (Part One of the course). The second is a 10-12 page paper that more deeply explores one of the case studies or controversies we will study in Parts Two and Three of the course.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nPaper 1\n\n20%\n\nPaper 2\n\n40%\n\nReading Response Papers (3)\n\n10%\n\nClass Participation\n\n30%\n\nFor further detail on the course assignments, please see the\nAssignments\nsection.",

      "content": "21H.181\n\nLibertarianism in History\n\nPaper #1\n\nFor Session 2, we read two articles and listened to one radio debate\nthat illustrate certain contemporary libertarian controversies and\nprinciples. Since then (and through the end of Part One of the course),\nwe have been \"mining\" the history and political theory of the idea of\nliberty for insights into the background, origins, and contexts of those\nand other contemporary controversies and contexts. For this first paper,\nplease revisit these readings and audio in light of what you have learned\nin Part One of the course. Your essay should touch on at least two of the\nthree controversies we addressed during Session 2, one of which must be\nthe radio debate between Krueger and Henderson over income inequality.\nIn addition, your analysis should adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n1. You should identify specific readings from our historical survey of\nthe political theory of liberty that you believe relate most closely to\nthe contemporary controversy in question. Having identified those\nhistorical materials, you should then explore their meaning and\nresonance for the contemporary controversy. Why does the NPR\ndebate over income inequality echo, for example, the tension\nbetween different understandings of pre-modern liberty as\nanalyzed by Orlando Patterson or Quentin Skinner, for example?\nPerhaps you think it does not, and that John Rawls or Benjamin\nConstant is the most relevant authority; in that case, give us a\nsense of how a \"Rawlsian\" or other perspective on this issue differs\n(or would differ) from one of the competing frameworks we have\nstudied in Part One of the course.\n\n2. You are welcome to but need not yourself take a position on the\ncontemporary controversies you choose to analyze. In either case,\nyour paper should make clear what the conflicts are \"about\" - why\nthey have taken the form they have and why they persist - from a\ntheoretical and historical perspective, again making specific\nreference to the sources we have studied in Part One.\n\n3. You may find, for example, that Rand Paul's ideas are remarkably\nconsistent with those of Benjamin Constant\n\nor Friedrich Hayek. If\nso, say so. But there is no requirement here that you \"map\" a\nparticular theorist or historical source onto a contemporary\ncounterpart. If you see certain traces of the American Declaration\nof Independence in the dispute over phone surveillance and\nprivacy, be specific about what statements in the Declaration you\n\nhave in mind. If you feel that the contemporary controversies\nreflect elements in the libertarian tradition that we have not\nexplored (through the end of Part One of the course), please\n\nidentify what you think those elements are and whose views you\nbelieve are associated with them. But there is no requirement that\nyou go \"outside\" the required readings for this course or do any\nadditional research.\n\n4. Identify your sources as specifically as possible, but your citations\ncan be shorthand and either parenthetical or in a footnote (no\nendnotes please), as in \"Patterson p. 35,\" or \"Nozick p. 230\" (using\nfor the latter the pagination from the Sandel reader). If it is an\nonline source that does not have pagination, use paragraph\nnumbers if available, otherwise use direct quotes in quotation\nmarks so as to permit me to recognize the statement from the\nonline version of our source. All factual assertions that go beyond\nthe obvious or beyond widely shared understandings about\nhistorical events should be sourced, and your references to the\nhistory and political theory of liberty from our syllabus should be\nsourced as well.\n\nPapers should be 8-10 pages, double-spaced, and are due during\nSession 12.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n21H.181 Libertarianism in History\nSpring 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
