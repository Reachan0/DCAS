  "course_description": "This seminar is designed to be an experimental and hands-on approach to applied chemistry (as seen in cooking). Cooking may be the oldest and most widespread application of chemistry and recipes may be the oldest practical result of chemical research. We shall do some cooking experiments to illustrate some chemical principles, including extraction, denaturation, and phase changes.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session\n\nRequired Textbook\n\nMcGee, Harold.\nOn Food and Cooking, The Science and Lore of the Kitchen\n. NewYork, NY: Scribner, 1997. ISBN: 9780684800011.\n\nOverview\n\nWelcome to the seminar entitled Kitchen Chemistry. This is a Pass/Fail, 6-unit seminar (2 hours of class and 4 hours of reading and homework per week). This seminar is designed to look at cooking from a scientific basis. Each week we will do an edible experiment and look at the science behind how it all works. Not only will chemical principles be examined, but also biochemical, biological, microbiological, and maybe even a little physics. Students are required to attend at least 80% of the classes.\n\nView video page\n\nMIT chemist Patricia Christie discusses her course, \"Kitchen Chemistry,\" and how it makes students look at their food differently.\n\nThis video is from the\nMITNewsOffice\nvia YouTube, and is not covered under our\nCreative Commons license\n.\n\nRequirements\n\nAs a student in this seminar, you are required to participate in at least 80% of the experiments and keep a journal commenting on each experiment: what worked well, what did not work well, ways that the session could be improved for next year. The journal will have to be turned in at the last class in order for you to receive credit for the seminar. It will not be read until the grade sheets have been turned in, so honesty is appreciated. You are also required to hand in the weekly problem sets at the beginning of the next week's class. You will also be required to write a 2-4 page paper on some aspect of the chemistry of food.\n\nThe second to last class (week 13) will be an exercise in peer teaching. Working either alone or in pairs, you will be required to find at least two people to come to class and you will become the teacher. You will teach your fellow students about one of the recipes we did in class or one of your own.\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nGuacamole, salsa, make your own hot sauce, and quesadillas\n\nCookie - death by chocolate\n\nPancakes\n\nBread\n\nScones and coffee\n\nMeringue\n\nJams and jellies\n\nThree bean chili and corn bread\n\nCheese\n\nMolecular gastronomy\n\nWacky cake\n\nIce cream\n\nPeer teaching\n\nPasta, meatballs, and creme brulee",

(1 cup) Chocolate pieces\n-\n4 cup firmly packed brown sugar\n-\n4 cup butter or margarine\n- 2 eggs\n- 1 tsp. vanilla\n- 1 cup flour\n- 1 tsp. baking powder\n- 2 cups chopped nuts (optional)\nMethod:\n- Heat oven to 350OF. Position the oven racks in the middle of the over or if there are\nmultiple racks of cookies going in, put one rack in the bottom third and one rack in\nthe top third of the oven.\n- Microwave 8 squares of chocolate in a large microwavable bowl with the butter on\nHigh for 1-2 minutes.\n- Stir until chocolate/butter mixture is melted and smooth\n- Stir in sugar, eggs and vanilla. Mix until smooth\n- Add the baking powder to the flour and mix. Then add the flour mixture to the\nchocolate mixture.

Then rotate the rack and move to the top rack and\ncook for an additional 8 minutes. Cookies are done when they are puffed and feel set\nto the touch. It might require additional baking back on the bottom rack. You need to\nreally watch the bottom baking to make sure you don't burn your cookies\n- Cool on cookie sheet 1 minute.\n- Transfer to wire rack or parchment paper to cool completely.\n- Makes about 2 dozen cookies.\nNotes:\nIf you are not a chocoholic and wish to reduce the amount of chocolate, you can add\nwhite chocolate chips or just eliminate the chocolate chips\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nES.287 / 5.S15 Kitchen Chemistry\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

It is a moist cheese with a spreadable\ntexture. It can be used as a spread or in cooking. Makes 6 -8 ounces\nThis soft cheese recipe consists of three steps: acidifying and coagulation,\ndraining and mixing, salting and spicing.\nIngredients:\n- 1 quart (4 cups) milk\n- juice of 2 lemons (about 1 cup) or another acidifying agent; orange juice,\nraspberry vinegar or cider vinegar.\n- salt and herbs\nStep 1 : Acidifying and coagulation\n- using a double boiler ( or a metal bowl floating in a pan of water), indirectly\nheat 1 quart of milk to 170 oF. This will take anywhere from 15 minutes to 30\nminutes. Make sure all of the milk is at least 170 0F.\n- Remove the milk from the heat\n- Add the lemon juice and let the milk set for 15 minutes. If the milk does not\nset (i.e. you see the milk proteins precipitated out of solution), add more\nlemon juice.\nStep 2: Draining\n- Pour the curds into a cheesecloth-lined colander. Tie the four corners of the\ncheesecloth into a knot and hang bag to drain for 1 to 2 hours or until the\ncurds have stopped draining. After the initial burst of dripping, this process\ncan be aided by gently squeezing the curds to remove the water. Using this\nprocess, you can probably speed up the draining step to 30 minutes.\n- You can save the whey. It can be used in cooking, such as baking bread. It is\nsupposedly is a refreshing summer-time drink if it is chilled and served with\nmint leaves.\nStep 3: Mixing, Slating and Spicing\n- Take the cheese out of the cheesecloth. You may have to scrape some off the\nclothe\n- The cheese can be lightly salted and herbs may be added if desired.\n- One way to season the cheese is to make it into a log and roll it in coarsely\nground pepper.\n- The yield should be about 6 - 8 ounces of lemon cheese for each quart of milk.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nES.287 / 5.S15 Kitchen Chemistry\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

You don't have to add the eggs\n2. While you are freezing the ice cream, make sure that you are continually\nstirring to maximize the amount of air incorporation.\n3. If you overfreeze your ice cream, you can speed the melting of the ice cream\nto an edible consistency, put the mixing bowl inside of a bowl filled with\nwarm water.\n4.\nES 287 or 5.S15\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nES.287 / 5.S15 Kitchen Chemistry\nSpring 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
