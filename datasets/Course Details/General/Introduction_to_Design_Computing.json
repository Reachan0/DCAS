Your proposal for the project is due in the Mayors office Dec 17th in booklet\nform illustrating the glory of your design. Prepare a presentation for the town that demonstrates your\nvisual thoughts and construction methods with 3D modeling, computer rendering and rapid prototyping.\nYour presentation should convince the town that you have designed a wonderful place on a historic site for\nany for less than $100,000 (the cost of a 400 square foot cabin).\nDesign\nThe goal of the project is to put forth a well designed prototypical cottage. The design should take\nadvantage of form, space and light, it should be a great work of architecture. For final assignment your\njob will be to redesign areas of your cottage that received negative design and technical evaluation from\nclass instructors. Do not feel that you need to redesign the entire cottage, review comments from old\nassignments and consider fixing areas that are weak in appearance or construction. If you decide to\nredesign the entire cottage start from the statement you wrote for the first design. Then make sure that\ndesign decisions match the goals in the statement; light, space and form.\n\n4.500 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATION\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Architecture\nMaterials for Final Presentation\nThis assignment should satisfy three goals in the course:\n- Presentation of a design idea with clarity (the purpose and design of the cabin)\n- Demonstration of great design exploration - shows that you have the best solution\n- Proof of technical understanding in design and construction\nOne Word Document - should read like a project proposal\na) One 24\" x 36\" Poster\nb) The word document - in color & \"stapled\"\n(\"No bindings One staple in the upper left hand corner only\")\nOn Paper\nGrading\nThe final project is 10% of your grade so do as much as you can. For this presentation you will be graded\na maximum of 5 points for items 1-6 (30 points), 60 points for the model and 10 points for the over all\npresentation.\nUpload to Stellar\n\n4.500 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATION\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Architecture\nImage No.\nInformation on Poster & Paper Document\nDescription & Sketch\n- Name and Project Title\n- Design all of the pages******\n- Five points on why your cottage is great***\n- Make sure the text is legible (Try not to incorporate text into the image)\nAxonometric Rendering\nSite Drawing\n\n4.500 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATION\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Architecture\nFloor Plan Drawing\nElevation and or Section\nPhoto of 3D print\n\n4.500 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATION\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Architecture\nLaser Cut Model\n1/8\" masonite & paint\nBuild a laser cut model of one corner of the building this model should convince the town that you\nhave invented a way to produce the building. The model should include the following components\n1 - Outer and inner walls of 1/8\" masonite\n2 - 1/8\" studs in between the surfaces\n3 - Siding attach by Friction/glue (assignment #8)\nDownload the model from \"examples of construction modeling\" on the class website. There you will\nfind a file of the instant cabin and a presentation on paper. Demonstrated is an approach to digital\nfabrication for a small structure of 3⁄4\" plywood (1/8\" masonite as a prototype). However the cabin is\nmissing siding. You are required to cut a 6' section in x & y of the building for laser cutting. You can\nbuild the full height of the section or 3⁄4 of the height. The full height might require 4 sheeets of\nmasonite and 3 hours of cutting. The image below is example of the model as a full scale structure\nfor CNC fabrication of plywood. You will need to scale the model to 1:6 in order to cut it of 1/8\"\nmasonite. The siding should be fabricated of 1/8\" masonite modeled as 3⁄4\" plywood full scale."

The town of Concord Massachusetts is known for it's of great\nwriters such as Henry Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne as well as the great poet/philosopher Ralph Waldo\nEmerson. Thoreau was famous for building a small writing cabin on Walden Pond (Figure 1), he also write\nthe famous text entitled \"Walden\".\nSITE: The cabin site is on the Concord River, a marshy water logged site. Brush will be cleared to make\nroom for the small writers cabin how ever the design goal is to make the cabin a part of the landscape.\nYour job is to propose a new cabin to be used by a writer for two weeks maximum. For the final you will\ncompete against others in the class for best proposal and a commission to build your cabin (in theory).\nYour proposal must come complete with built in furniture for one person to relax and work for two weeks.\nThe total cost of materials (Plywood, studs and concrete based) should be no more than $30,000. No\nMcMansions here.\nPROGRAM: The cabin must to include small amenities for one person to eat, sleep and relax for two\nweeks. This project will last the full length of the term and is expected to be beautiful, appearance and\npresentation style count. For cabin design learn how design the project from other architects work. Read\nthrough magazines and books on cabin and small house design. Take notes and use the best concepts\nas a base for your ideas for each weeks study.\nGRADING: You will be graded on the quality of your design, quality of the representation as\nconstructability of physical models and the visual beauty of virtual images. You will loose points for poor\ndesign, sloppy computer modeling, rendering and poor construction.\nFigure 1 Image of the site from the North Bridge & Thoreau's cabin on Walden Pond.\nThis assignment is due in lecture and Stellar, Tuesday, September 16\nBUILDING STYLE: Since the course does not focus completely on design the cabin style is can be\nanything from early colonial to high tech modern.

We will supply the 1⁄2 masonite for prototyping & 1⁄2 plywood for the full\nscale example, the prototype (this assignment) is due in class November 25th.\nHouses are sided of shingle, vinyl, wood clapboard, cedar and cement fiber board known as Hardi board.\nYou have been asked to design a unique siding set of plywood. The siding will act as a rain screen, not a\nwater resistant surface. A rain screen is a surface on the outside of a building that resists the hard\ndamaging forces or rain and wet snow. It is not meant to completely repel water there is a vapor barrier\nbehind the rain screen to prevent moisture from getting into the building. The reason you have been\nasked to design siding is that traditional wood shingles and clapboards take a very long time to install.\nThe hope is that you will design a fast simple way to side the building that looks great.\nFigure 1 Frank Gehry's experience music project is lined with a rain screen.\n\n4.500 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATION\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Architecture\nCONCEPT\nThe design should one of stand alone components attached to the side of the building. Possible with this\nsystem is a 50 year material that can be held onto the side of the building by friction only. The screen will\nbe attached to the 3⁄4\" frame you prototyped last week. Figure 1 conceptually describes the assignment\nprocess required to ultimately build a sample of the rain screen at full scale. Starting with the original\nmodel cut section 8' deep x 8'wide x 16' high then use that section as a skeleton for tracing a new\nabstract model from the cut building shape. Next, build a surface or set of surfaces that show where the\nsample originates. YOU WILL NEED TO INCLUDE A SIMILAR PROCESS IMAGE IN YOUR ASSIGNMENT\nTURN IN. The process image should show (1) the building, (2) the section, (3) abstract copy, (4) the rain-\nscreen and the (5) sample area (2' x 4').\nFigure 1. Process of reduction from starting building shape to CNC sample area\nFILE PREP\nFollow these steps to prepare the model\na) Create a copy of your model and rename the copy to suite the purpose. For example your original\nmodel should be lableled: lsass_cottage_original.dwg\nYour copy should be labeled: lsass_cottage_siding_prototype.dwg\nYou may want to go back and re-label .dwg files based on the purpose of file.\nlsass_cottage_original.dwg\n\nlsass_cottage_3Dprint.dwg\n\nlsass_cottage_laser_cut.dwg\n\nb) In real space make a box 8w' x 8d' x 16h' box. Use the box to find an area of the roof to build,\nbest to find complex unresolved areas of the design (Figure 1)\nCommand: \"Slice\" - Select area - choose yz or zx to slice.\nCreate a boxed area around your model and erase all unused model material\n\n4.500 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATION\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Architecture\nDESIGN\nThe rain-screen should be of components either interlocking with the framing surface or bolted back to\nthe frame. Friction fit is easier to execute in the field and cost less. Your job is to design a beautiful rain-\nscreen as a checker board of parts.\n1.\nIt should look attractive - no ugly siding\n2. It should be light weight - remove as much material as possible\n3. Strength - strong enough to withstand a destructive child\n4. Assures assembly between parts\n5. Variation between panels - every panel does not have to be the same.\n6. The edges should be different in design than the middle, depending on your design\nFigure 2 Pattern Design\n\n4.500 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATION\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Architecture\nASSEMBLY\nDesign a common assembly for each of the 9 panels. The assembly should be very strong, spaced from\nthe main frame enough to get your hand between the siding and the frame. For this assignment the\nbacker board will be the same material as the 1/2\" siding (1/8\" masonite).\nFigure 3 3D assembly of siding with backer board.\nLASER CUTTING\nLaser cut a prototype of the rain screen at 1\" = 4\" or 1/8\" masonite - enlarged 4x equals 1⁄2\" material for\nCNC cutting.

Before you can explore building details you will need to explore shapes beyond the box. Frank\nLloyd Wright always believed in creating shapes that broke from the box. Today architects such as\nNorman Foster, Frank Gehry, Nox and Alsop architects believe in breaking the box through the creation of\nnon-Euclidian, non-box like shapes. Some architects such as Frank Gehry and Norman Foster work with\nconstructible shapes in design always knowing that what they design on paper can be built. Some\ndesigners create designs they are not so sure of in construction, these architects use the design process\nto explore shape possibilities learning how to construct later. The first part of your job will be to explore\nconstructible shapes. This means shapes built of flat sides, avoid curves for they are very hard to\nconstruct. The second part will be to use solid modeling to construct building parts (walls, a floor, windows,\ndoors and a roof) from one of the complex shape designs in part 1.\nThis assignment is due in lecture and on Stellar, Tuesday, September 23\n\n4.500 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATION\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n1) Create interesting shapes that respond to environmental elements (assignment #1)\n2) There is no right or wrong shape design\n3) Try to shape the initial volume from the plan (#1 below) do not over extend shapes\n(your model will be too big)\n4) Stay away from curved shapes\n5) Use your eyes to design and test arrangements of shape\nModeling Process\nBuild the original shape from the plan (extrusion of plan). Using solid volumes add and subtract shapes\nfrom the original volume.\nPART 1: DESIGN SHAPES\nDesign the shape of your cottage in AutoCAD with varying sides. The shape of your cottage should reflect\nthe environmental study completed the week before. For example, you may want one side to demonstrate\nthat there no view with small windows (towards the dunes), and the other to reflect that there is a view with\nlarger windows (towards the ocean). Starting with the boundary of your plan you will need to design 4\nshape variations from the original shape for this part of the assignment. Your job will be to turn in the 5\nshapes (the original shape [1] and 4 designed shapes) as a 3D model on stellar and to print the 5 shapes\non paper like the illustration below.\n\n4.500 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATION\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nPART 2: DESIGNING COMPONENTS\nAs a designer pick a shape from the set of shapes (you can not pick shape #1) to use as the skeleton of\nyour design. Here you will subtract windows, design doors, a floor and roof. The goal of part 2 will be to\ndesign the external shape of your cottage as a basic block model. Create simple shapes outlining roof\nlines, wall and window openings, separating the model into 6 distinct layers:\n1)\nGround Surface\n2)\nFloor\n3)\nWalls\n4)\nRoof\n5)\nWindow openings, Door openings\n6)\nDetails (stairs, etc.)\nModeling Process\nThis example starts with a very simple shape, your shape will be slightly harder. Starting with a shape\nselect from the 5 shapes above use the images below as a process guide that will lead you to a modeled\ncottage. Also use the environmental forces from assignment one to drive the location of windows and\ndoors.\nFig. 1. Selected shape\nFig. 2. 12\" Floor deck over\n12\" square piles\nFig. 6.

As you will all see, models from the class will range results in size and shape. Printed models can\nalso range in detail, best are models that walk a fine line between too much detail and strength in\nmodeling.\nA major advantage of u 3D printing is its ability to manufacture many different types of models. Although\nthe model below appears to be the same model printed 4 times, each is a variation of the original design.\nNote - You are not required to model and print 4 designs you are only required to print one.\nCarefully follow the steps on the proceeding pages they will help you get through production and\nmanufacturing of your model. The quality of you model will be judged on its strength (did it break during\nextraction), detail and general architectural design. This is the best time to change the form of your\ndesign if the previous models were complex or unattractive.\n1 - VIRTUAL MODEL - is due on Stellar Tuesday October 28th, 9:30 am.\n\n4.500 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATION\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Architecture\nFollow these steps to prepare your design for 3D printing:\na) COPY ORIGINAL MODEL: Create a copy of your model and rename the copy to suite the\npurpose. For example your original model should be lableled: lsass_cottage_original.dwg\nYour copy should be labeled: lsass_cottage_3D_print.dwg\nb) SCALE MODEL: (fig. 1)\na. Within the new model file create a new layer called \"3DP-scale\"\nb. Copy the original model and change all components to this new layer\nc. Construct a 5l\" x 4w\" x 8h\" box at the 0,0 to simulate the volume of the 3D print area\nd. Create a new layer called \"3DP-box\" and change the new volume to that layer.\ne. Lock the box in the layer dialogue box.\nf.\nIn AutoCAD scale the model by 1/60th this should enable you to fit some part of the\nmodel within the envelope of the printer. Type \"scale>>all>>basepoint - 0,0,0>>scale\nfactor>>1/60.\nNOTE: Most people will not be able to fit the entire building within the print volume. You are\nexpected to select an important section of the model.\nFig. 1 scaled model by\n1/60\nFig. 2 cropped model\nc) CROP: (fig 2)\na. Cut off edges of model\nd) COPY TO NEW LAYER\na.

Taking\ninto consideration the delicate marshy terrain of the shores of the Concord River, this small\ncabin will be raised on a platform about four feet above the ground (made of wood decking\nmaterial) that also duals as an outdoor patio. There will be two main parts of the cabin: a fully‐\nwindowed sunroom facing the river, and a private bedroom area behind it. The sunroom will\nevoke a bay‐window‐esque form, be covered by a bold V‐shaped roof, and extend into a mini‐\nexterior patio to embrace the river view and take advantage of the long summer daylight hours\nof New England. During the snowy and rainy months, the roof will help to defer runoff by\ndirecting water back into the earth and towards the river, in order to control flooding in the\nmarsh. Despite the modern sunroom, the cabin as a whole will remain small and modest in size,\nincluding also a bathroom and kitchenette, fit for one woodsy, down‐to‐earth yet free‐spirited,\nsun‐worshipping writer.\n4.500 Introduction to Design Computing\nAssignment 1\nSeptember 16, 2008"

You should grab all three files\nsimultaneously when opening them. The files types are: .3gx (the surface file), .geo (the geometry\nfile), and .3dp (the part file, which houses Work Step data). As you work these file types will be\ngenerated automatically, but it is important to save all three (File>Save>Save All).\n3.2\nIn EZ-cam go to File, Open. Navigate to your AutoCAD file and open it. If you get the message\n\"Unused blocks...\" just click OK\n3.3\nClick the xy icon in the upper left corner of the EZ-cam interface (the border should now be\npositioned in conjunction with EZ-cam's origin)\nPlan View\nIsometric View\n3.4\nEZ-cam automatically shows surface/curve directions. to turn these off go to View, Setup..., and\nuncheck Show Surf/Curve Directions\"\nNOTE: Now we're going to generate paths for cutting, and they must be selected and assigned according\nto the sequence they will be cut.
