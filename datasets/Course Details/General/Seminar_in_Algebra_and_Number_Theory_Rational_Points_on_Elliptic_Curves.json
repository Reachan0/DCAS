      "content": "18.704 Fall 2004 Homework 1 Solutions\nAll references are to the textbook \"Rational Points on Elliptic Curves\" by\nSilverman and Tate, Springer Verlag, 1992. Problems marked (*) are more\nchallenging exercises that are optional but not required.\n1. Do Exercise A.3 from the textbook, parts (a) and (b).\nSolution. (a) Think of P2 as\n{ [a, b, c]| a, b, c not all zero} /\nwhere [a, b, c] [a0, b , c0] if there exists a nonzero t with a = ta0, b = tb , c = tc .\nNow let x, y, z be coordinates in 3-space, i.e. A3 . We define a map\n: Lines in A3 through the origin -! P2\nas follows. Given a line β through the origin in A3 , simply pick any point\n(a, b, c) → = (0, 0, 0) on β and define (β) = [a, b, c] ∼ P2 . Why is this well-defined?\nWell if we pick a different non-origin point (a0, b , c0) ∼ β then since β is a line\nthrough the origin, (a0, b , c ) is just a nonzero scalar multiple of (a, b, c), so\n[a0, b , c0] = [a, b, c] ∼ P2 .\nThe map is surjective: given p = [a, b, c] ∼ P2, then the vector (a, b, c) → =\n(0, 0, 0) and so p = (β) where β is the unique line joining p to the origin.\nThe map is injective: if (β1) = [a, b, c] = (β2), then both of the points\n(0, 0, 0), (a, b, c) lie on both of the lines β1, β2, so since two points determine a\nunique line we have β1 = β2. Thus determines a bijective correspondence\nbetween lines in A3 through the origin and points in P2 .\n(b) Every plane through the origin in A3 has the form\n,, = { (a, b, c) ∼ A3| a + b + αc = 0}\nfor some , , α not all zero. But by our definition of lines in P2, every line\nβ ∼ P2 has the form\nβ,, = { [a, b, c] ∼ P2| a + b + αc = 0}\nfor some , , α not all zero.\nSince\n(S,, ) = L,, = β,, ,\n\nthere is a bijective correspondence between planes through the origin in A3\nand lines in P2 .\n2. Do Exercise A.8 part (b) from the text.\nSolution. Let C0 be the affine curve x2 + xy - 2y2 + x - 5y + 7 = 0. Since\nthe largest degree of the terms in the equation for C0 is 2, we may homogenize\nthe equation by adding enough powers of Z to each term to make it have degree\n2. So we get that\nC : X2 + XY - 2Y 2 + XZ - 5Y Z + 7Z2 = 0\ndefines a curve in P2 whose affine part is the given affine curve C0. To find the\npoints at infinity on C, we substitute Z = 0 and solve:\nX2 + XY - 2Y 2 = 0.\nFactoring, we have\n(X + 2Y )(X - Y ) = 0, so X = -2Y or X = Y.\nThus there are two points at infinity on C, [-2, 1, 0] and [1, 1, 0]. These corre\nspond to the \"directions\" in the affine plane given by the lines x = -2y and\nx = y.\n3. (a) Do Exercise A.16(a) from the textbook.\n(b) (*) Do Exercise A.16(b) from the textbook.\nSolution. (a) The equation of an arbitrary conic in P2 takes the form\nC : aX2 + bXY + cY 2 + dXZ + eY Z + fZ2 = 0\nfor some a, b, c, d, e, f not all zero. Suppose we pick a random point in P2, such as\nP = [2, 3, 5] ∼ P2 . Then P lies on C if and only if 4a+6b+9c+10d+15e+25f = 0.\nSimilarly, given any point Pi = [ri , si, ti] ∼ P2, the condition for p to lie on C\nis a single linear equation ri a + risib + si c + ritid + sitie + t2f = 0. Thus\ni\nwe see that the 5 given points P1, . . . , P5 lie on C if and only if ri\n2a + risib +\nsi c + ritid + sitie + t2f = 0 holds for i = 1, 2, . . ., 5. Since this is a set of\ni\n5 homogeneous equations in the 6 variables a, b, c, d, e, f, there is at least one\nsolution for a, b, c, d, e, f with not all of them zero.\n(b) In this problem, one is supposed to show that there is a unique conic\ngoing through the 5 distinct points if and only if no four of the five points lie\non a line. This was an extra credit problem and the proof is a little involved;\nplease come see me if you want to talk over the solution.\n\n4. Do Exercise 1.7 parts (b) and (c) from the text. Also, in case some\nrational point exists, find formulas which give all rational points in terms of a\nparameter t, and use the formula to write down some particular rational point\non the curve that you would have never guessed by inspection.\nSolution. (a) We will show that there are no rational solutions to the equa\ntion 3x2 + 5y2 = 4. Suppose that (x, y) is a rational solution to the equation.\nWe can choose a common denominator for the rational numbers x, y so that\nx = X/Z, y = Y/Z, with X, Y, Z integers. Then [X, Y, Z] lies on the projective\ncurve C : 3X2 + 5Y 2 - 4Z2 = 0.\nRecall the notation a|b means that \"a divides b\". If there is some integer p\nsuch that p|X, p|Y , and p|Z, then [X0, Y 0, Z0] is also on the curve C, where X0 =\nX/p, Y 0 = Y/p, Z0 = Z/p. Thus by removing all common factors from [X, Y, Z]\nwe may assume that [X, Y, Z] is a point on the curve such that gcd{X, Y, Z} = 1.\nNow any square is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 3. Then 3X 2\n0 mod 3, 5Y 2 0 or 2 mod 3, and 4Z2 0 or 1 mod 3. The only way\nthis is possible is if 3X2 5Y 2 4Z2 0 mod 3. But then 3|Y and 3|Z.\nConsequently, 9|Y 2 and 9|Z2, forcing 3|X. Now X, Y, Z have the common factor\n3, contradicting the assumption that gcd{X, Y, Z} = 1. This contradiction\nproves that the original curve cannot have a rational point.\n(b) By trial and error, we find the point (2/3, 2/3) is a rational point on the\ncurve C0 : 3x2 + 6y2 = 4. Now we follow the method on page 11 of the text\nfor parametrizing the rational points on the curve. Given the point (0, t) with\nt rational, the line through (2/3, 2/3) and (0, t) is y = t + (2 - 3t)(x)/2. This\nhits the curve C0 at an additional point (x0, y0). Substituting the formula for\ny into the equation for C0, we get a quadratic equation in x:\n-12t2 + 8t\nx +\nx + constant term = 0.\n9t2 - 12t + 6\nSince one of the roots is x = 2/3, the other is\n12t2 - 8t\nx0 =\n- 2/3\n9t2 - 12t + 6\nand then\ny0 = t + (2 - 3t)(x0)/2.\n(Note. Your exact formulas may be different depending on your choice of a\nrational line on which to project.)\nNow letting t run over all rational numbers, (x0, y0) defined by these formulas\nruns over all rational points on the curve C0. (Actually, one point is missed.\nWe need to let \"t = ≡\" in order to get the point (2/3, -2/3).)\nPicking t = 1, we get (x0, y0) = (2/3, 2/3) again! But picking t = -1 we get\nthe more interesting point (2/27, -22/27) ∼ C0 which is a point we would have\nbeen unlikely to guess."

      "content": "18.704 Fall 2004 Homework 2 Solutions\nAll references are to the textbook \"Rational Points on Elliptic Curves\" by\nSilverman and Tate, Springer Verlag, 1992. Problems marked (*) are more\nchallenging exercises that are optional but not required.\n1. A cubic in Weierstrass normal form is C0 : y2 = x3 + ax2 + bx + c, or in\nhomogeneous coordinates, C : Y 2Z = X3 + aX2Z + bXZ2 + cZ3 . Prove that\nC is a nonsingular curve if and only if the polynomial x3 + ax + bx + c has\ndistinct roots. Show also that the point at infinity [0, 1, 0] is an inflection point\non the curve C.\nSolution. We will solve this problem using homogeneous coordinates.\n(Note: the book does prove on p. 26 that C0 has a singular point if and\nonly if f (x) = x3 + ax2 + bx + c has distinct roots. So another approach is to\nreproduce that \"affine coordinates\" proof; then you only need to show that the\nsingle point at infinity [0, 1, 0] is always nonsingular.)\nLet F (X, Y, Z) = X3 +aX2Z +bXZ2 +cZ3 -Y 2Z, so that C is the vanishing\nlocus in P2 of the polynomial F . Suppose that [r, s, t] is a point on the curve\nwhere all three partial derivatives of F vanish. We calculate\nβF/βX = 3X2 + 2aXZ + bZ2\nβF/βY = 2Y Z\nβF/βZ = aX2 + 2bXZ + 3cZ2 - Y 2 .\nFrom the second equation we see that either s = 0 or t = 0. Suppose that t = 0;\nthen the first equation gives r = 0, and finally the third equation gives s = 0.\nBut [0, 0, 0] is not a point in P2, so we can ignore this possibility.\nThis means that we do not have to worry about the case t = 0, so since we\nare working in projective space we can assume that t = 1 by scaling. We still\nhave to worry about the case s = 0. In that case, the first equation above says\nthat r is a root of 3x2 + 2ax + b = 0. Since [r, 0, 1] also lies on the curve C,\nr is a root of x3 + ax2 + bx + c = 0. Thus r is a root both of the polynomial\np(x) = x3 + ax2 + bx + c and its derivative p0(x) = 3x2 + 2ax + b. Then r is a\ndouble root of the polynomial p(x) and p(x) does not have distinct roots.\nConversely, if r is a multiple root of the polynomial p(x) then r is also a\nroot of the polynomial p0(x). But then r is also a root of 3p(x) - xp0(x) =\nax2 + 2bx + 3c. It follows that in this case [r, 0, 1] is a point on C where all three\npartial derivatives vanish, so C fails to be nonsingular.\n\nTo show that P = [0, 1, 0] is an inflection point on C, we first need to find\nthe tangent to the curve C at P. This is the line X + Y + αZ = 0 where\n= βF/βX(P) = 0, = βF/βY (P) = 0, and α = βF/βZ(P) = -1. In other\nwords, the line at infinty Z = 0 is the tangent line to C at the point P. But\nsince P is clearly the only point of intersection of Z = 0 with C, the point P\nmust be an inflection point.\n2. Let C be a nonsingular cubic curve in P2 (not necessarily in Weierstrass\nform.) Suppose that O is an inflection point on C. Make the rational points on\nC into a group using O as the identity element, as in Section I.2 of the text.\n(a) Prove that a point P 2 C satisfies P +P = O (in other words the order of\nP in the group divides 2) if and only if the tangent line to C at P goes through\n.\nO\n(b) Prove that a point P 2 C satisfies P + P + P = O (i.e. P has order\ndividing 3 in the group) if and only if P is an inflection point on the curve.\nSolution. (a) We have P + P = (P P) O. If P + P = O, then there is a\nline δ whose three points of intersection with C are O, O, P P. Since δ hits O\ntwice, δ must be the tangent line to C at O. But since O is a point of inflection,\nthis happens if and only if P P =\n. This says exactly that the tangent line\nO\nto the curve at P goes through O. The converse is similar.\n(b) Recall the way we constructed additive inverses to show that the points\non C are a group: first find O O; In our case this is O again. Then given any\npoint P on C, we have -P\n.\n= P O\nNow suppose that P +P +P = (P +P)+P =\n. Then P O =\n= P +P.\n-P\nO\nWrite Q = P P. Then P O = P + P = O Q; this means the line through P\nand O and the line through Q and O have identical third points of intersection,\nwhich forces P = Q. Finally, we have shown P P = P which means that P is\nan inflection point.\nThe converse follows by reversing these steps.\n3. This problem concerns the affine curve C0 : x3 + y = for some nonzero\nconstant . In homogeneous coordinates, this is C : X3 + Y 3 = Z3 . In\nparticular, [1, -1, 0] is a point at infinity on the curve. In fact C is a nonsingular\ncurve and [1, -1, 0] is an inflection point (you don't have to prove this.) Define\na group law on C by taking O = [1, -1, 0] as the identity.\n(a) Given a point P = (x0, y0) 2 C0, find the tangent line to C at P.\n(b) Let P = (x0, y0) be a rational point on C0. Find the coordinates of the\nadditive inverse Q of P, that is, the point Q such that P + Q =\n.\nO\n\np\n(c) Find all of the complex points P on C such that P + P = O. There are\nfour. How many of these points are rational points? (The answer depends on\n.)\n(d) Let = 9. Then (1, 2) 2 C0. Calculate (1, 2) + (1, 2). (You don't need\nto use section I.4. The formulas there are not applicable because they assume\nthe curve is in Weierstrass form.)\n(e)* Let = 1000. find all of the rational points on C in this case (feel free\nto quote known theorems without proof.) What kind of group do we get for the\nset of all rational points on C?\nSolution. (a) Using implicit differentiation, we have\ndy\nx\n3x 2 + 3y 2 dy = 0, so that\n=\n.\ndx\ndx\n-y2\nThen the tangent line to C0 at (x0, y0) is\nx0\ny -y0 =\n(x -x0).\n- y0\n(b) Since O is an inflection point, as we saw in problem 2 above we have\n=\n. Since O is the point at infinity coresponding to the direction\n-P\nP O\n(1, -1), the line through P and O is the unique line δ through P with slope -1,\ni.e. the line (y-y0) = -(x-x0). But since the curve C0 is symmetric about the\nline y = x, it follows that δ hits C0 in the third point (y0, x0). (If this geometric\nargument bothers you, one can also see this algebraically.) So -P = (y0, x0).\n(c) From problem 2 above, we are looking for all points P such that P P =\n=\n. We know that O itself is one such point, so assume now that P ∗\nO. Then\nO\nP = (x0, y0) is on the affine part of the curve C0. We calculated the tangent line\nto the curve at P above in part (a). This line will contain the point O if and\nonly if it has slope -1, i.e. if and only if x2 = y0 , or x0 = ±y0. Note that we\ncan't have x0 = -y0, for then since (x0, y0) 2 C, we would have = 0, which\nwe excluded.\nSo any point of order dividing 2 on the curve has the form (x0, x0). Then\n3 = /2. If we define α =\n/2, then the solutions to this equation are\nx0\nx0 = α, α, α2\nwhere = -1/2 +\np\n3i/2 is a third root of 1. Thus we have found all of the\npoints of order 2 on the curve:\nO = [1, -1, 0], (α, α), (α, α), (α2, α2).\nO is definitely a rational point on the curve (its homogeneous coordinates are\ncertainly rational.) Since α is real, α and α2 cannot be real numbers, so they\nare certainly not rational. Thus the only other point that is potentially rational\n\nis (α, α), which is rational if and only if happens to be twice the cube of a\nrational number.\nTo summarize: if is twice the cube of a rational number, then C has two\nrational points of order dividing 2, namely (α, α) and O; on the other hand, if\nis not twice the cube of a rational number, then O is the only rational point\non C of order dividing 2.\n(d) Now let = 9. The tangent line at the point (1, 2) is\n(y -2) = (-1/4)(x -1),\nby part (a). To find its third intersection point with C, we substitute y =\n(-1/4)x + 9/4 into the equation for C, getting\nx + ((-1/4)x + 9/4)3 = 9,\n63/64x 3 + 27/64x + a1x + a2 = 0,\nx 3 + 3/7x + b1x + b2 = 0,\nwhere here a1, a2, b1, b2 are some constants we won't care about. Then the\nsum of the three roots of the cubic is (-3/7), and so since the root x = 1 has\nmultiplicity two we must have the third root is x3 = -3/7 -1 -1 = -17/7.\nThen the corresponding y-coordinate is y3 = (-1/4)(-17/7) + 9/4 = 20/7.\nThus P P = (-17/7, 20/7). Then P + P = (P P) O, which as we saw in\npart (b) is equal to\nP + P = (20/7, -17/7).\n(e) Since = 1000, we are looking for rational solutions to x3 + y3 = 103 . If\nwe write x = X/Z, y = Y/Z for some integers X, Y, Z, then X3 + Y 3 = (10Z)3 .\nNow if we quote Fermat's last theorem for the case of the exponent 3 (that case\nhas been known for many years), then it says that the only solutions to this\nequation are the ones where one of X, Y, Z is 0. Since Z can't be zero, we see\nthat the only possible solutions are X = 0, Y = 10Z, or X = 10Z, Y = 0. In\naffine coordinates these are the two trivial solutions (x, y) = (0, 10), (10, 0). But\nwe need to also include the point at infinity [1, -1, 0], which is always a rational\npoint on the curve C (regardless of .) So the group of rational points on C\nconsists of precisely 3 elements. There is only one such group up to isomorphism,\nnamely the cylic group of order 3."

      "content": "18.704 Fall 2004 Homework 3 Solutions\nAll references are to the textbook \"Rational Points on Elliptic Curves\" by\nSilverman and Tate, Springer Verlag, 1992. Problems marked (*) are more\nchallenging exercises that are optional but not required.\nWe are going to prove the following result in class:\nTheorem 0.1 Let C be a nonsingular curve y2 = x3 + ax2 + bx + c where\na, b, c 2 Z are integers. Then if P = (x, y) is a rational point of finite order on\nC, then x and y are both in Z.\nAlthough we won't have finished proving this by the time you work on this\nproblem set, for now assume the theorem above is true.\nIn all of the problems below, C will be a nonsingular cubic curve in Weier\nstrass normal form, i.e. the solution set to y2 = f(x) = x3 + ax2 + bx + c where\nf(x) has distinct roots. We always take the zero element of the group to be the\npoint at infinity O = [0, 1, 0].\n1. For each curve below, determine if the given point has finite order, and if\nit does, calculate its order. Hint: rather than calculating P, 2P, 3P, . . . , it might\nsave time to calculate P, 2P, 4P, 8P, . . . and look for a pattern--note that the\nbook gives an explicit doubling formula on p.31 (at least for the x-coordinate.)\n(1) y2 = x3 - 43x + 166, P = (3, 8).\n(2) y2 = x3 + 17, P = (-2, 3).\nSolution. Recall the formulas for doubling a point. Given P = (x0, y0), the\ntangent line to C at P is y = x + λ where = f 0(x0)/2y0 and λ = y0 - x0.\nThen writing 2P = (x1, y1), we have x1 = 2 - a - 2x0 and y1 = -(λ + x1).\n(1) In this part we have a = 0, b = -43, c = 166, and P = (3, 8). Using the\nformulas above we can show that the tangent line to P is y = -x + 11, and\n2P = (-5, -16). The tangent line to 2P is y = -x - 21, and 4P = (11, 32).\nThe tangent line to 4P is y = 5x - 23, and 8P = (3, 8).\nWe notice that 8P = P . This means that 7P = O. Thus P has finite order,\nand its order must divide 7, so it is 1 or 7. Since O is the only point of order 1\nand P ≤= O, we must have that P has order 7.\n(2) We use the same formulas, but now with a = b = 0, c = 17, P = (-2, 3).\nThen the tangent line at P is y = 2x + 7, and 2P = (8, 23). Continuing, the\n\nslope of the tangent line at 2P is = 192/23. We need go no farther; it is clear\nfrom the formulas above that 4P will not have integer x-coefficient. If P were\na point of finite order, then 4P would also have finite order, and Theorem 0.1\nwould then imply that 4P has integer coefficients. Since this doesn't happen,\nwe conclude that P has infinite order in the group.\n2. In this problem you will prove the strong form of the Nagell-Lutz Theo\nrem, assuming Theorem 0.1 above. Assume that the equation of the nonsingu\nlar cubic curve C : y2 = f(x) = x3 + ax2 + bx + c has integer coefficients, i.e.\na, b, c 2 Z. Let\nψ(x) = x 4 - 2bx2 - 8cx + (b2 - 4ac).\nRecall from p. 31 of the text that if P = (x, y) and we write 2P = (x , y0) then\nx = ψ(x)/4y2 . Let D = -4a3c + a2b2 + 18abc - 4b3 - 27c2 be the discriminant\nof f(x). Now it turns out to be true that there are polynomials F (x), (x) with\ninteger coefficients such that\nF (x)f(x) + (x)ψ(x) = D.\nYou can assume this without proof; it is tedious to determine F and by hand.\n(1) (Strong form of the Nagell-Lutz Theorem) Do Exercise 2.11(b) from the\ntext.\n(2) What is the minimum number of rational points of finite order that a\nnonsingular cubic curve in Weierstrass form can have (remember to count O)?\nFind choices of a, b, c 2 Z so that y2 = f(x) has this minimal number of them.\nSolution. (1) By Theorem 0.1, if P = (x0, y0) is a rational point of finite\norder then P has integer coefficients. If P has order 2 then the tangent line at\nP is vertical and 2P = O. Now assume that P is of finite order greater than 2\n(in particular, then we know that y0 ≤= 0). Then we can use our given formulas,\nand 2P = (x1, y1) where x1 = ψ(x0 )/4y0 . We have that 2P also has finite order,\nso it has integer coefficients by our theorem. Then x1 is an integer and so in\nparticular y0 |ψ(x0 ). But since P is on the curve y2 = f(x), we certainly have\ny0 |f(x0). Now we use the given information: there exist integer polynomials\nF, such that\nF (x)f(x) + (x)ψ(x) = D.\nPlugging in x0, we have\nF (x0)f(x0) + (x0)ψ(x0) = D,\nand since F, f, , ψ are all polynomials with integer coefficients, all of the quan\ntities F (x0), f(x0), (x0 ), ψ(x0) are integers. Since y2|f(x0) and y2|ψ(x0 ), we\nconclude from the equation that y2|D as required.\n\np\np\np\n(2). None of our results seem to force a curve in Weierstrass form to have\nany rational points whatsoever, except for the point O. So we guess that C\ncan have as only a single rational point of finite order. By playing around, we\ncome up with the equation C : y2 = x3 -2 (you will likely think up a different\nexample.) Let us prove it has no rational points of finite order except O. To\nbe perfectly rigorous, I suppose we should check that C is nonsingular. Setting\nf(x) = x3 -2, we have f 0(x) = 3x . Now the only root of f 0(x) is 0, which is\nnot a root of f. By a previous homework problem, C is nonsingular.\nNow it is easy to see that x3 -2 = 0 has no rational solutions for x, since\nany such solution would have to be an integer dividing 2. So C has no rational\npoints of order 2. Now suppose C has a rational point (x0, y0) of finite order\n> 2. Then x0, y0 are integers. The discriminant of f is D = -4(27). By the\nstrong form of the Nagell-Lutz theorem, y0 | -108. Then y0 = ±1, ±2, ±3, or\n±6. However, none of the equations x3 -2 = 1, 4, 9, 36 has any integer solution\nfor x, since 3, 6, 11, and 38 are not cubes. Thus C has no rational points of\nfinite order in the affine plane, so O is its only rational point.\n3. In this problem we allow the coefficients a, b, c of f(x) to lie in the real\nnumbers R. We saw in class that C : y2 = f(x) has 9 points of order dividing 3\nif one allows complex coefficients. In this problem we are going to see how many\nof these points have real coefficients. Recall from p. 40 of the text that a point\nP = (x, y) ≤= O on C has order 3 if and only if x is a root of the polynomial\n(x) = 2f 00(x)f(x) -f 0(x)2 = 3x 4 + 4ax 3 + 6bx2 + 12cx + (4ac -b2).\nNow do Exercise 2.2(b) from the text.\nSolution. We saw in class that (x) has 4 distinct roots (over the complex\nnumbers.) Consider the local extrema of ; these occur at points x where\n0(x) = 0. Also, we note that 0(x) = 12f(x).\nBy the mean value theorem, between any two values 1 < 2 such that\n(1) = (2) = 0, there must be a 1 < α < 2 with 0(α) = 0. In other\nwords, between any two zeroes of lies a local extremum.\nNow suppose is a value such that (x) has a local extremum at , so\n0() = 12f() = 0, and so f() = 0. Then () = -f 0()2 0. Moreover, if\n() = 0, then f 0() = 0, so that f and f 0 have a common root , contradicting\nthe fact that the curve C is assumed to be nonsingular. Thus actually () < 0\nat any value of where has a local maximum or minimum. But since the\nleading term of (x) is 3x4 , we definitely have that limx!1 (x) = 1 and\nlimx!-1 (x) = 1.\nFrom all of this, we conclude that has precisely two real roots, say 1 < 2,\nand that (a) < 0 for all 1 < a < 2, with all of the local extrema occurring\nin this range. In particular, is decreasing at x = 1 and increasing at x = 2.\nSince 0 = f, we see that f(1) < 0 < f(2).\nThen the points of order 3 with real x-coordinate are (1, ± f(1)) and\n(2, ± f(2)). But only the two points (2, ± f(2) have real y-coordinate.\n\nTogether with O, these form exactly 3 points of order dividing 3 with coefficients\nin R."

Let R be the set of all\nrational numbers with no p in the denominator (when written in lowest terms),\nand for each 1 set\nC(p ) = {(t, s)|t ∗ p R, s ∗ p 3 R}.\nNow if P1 = (t1, s1) and P2 = (t2, s2) are two different points on C such that\nt1 = t2 and P1, P2 ∗ C(p ), prove that P1 + P2 ∗ C(p ). (The book claims that\nthis is true because P1 = -P2, which is a false statement.)\nSolution. (with thanks to Emmanuel Stoica.) Notice that as in the book\nwe use (t, s)-coordinates, i.e. we let the t-axis be horizontal and the s-axis be\nvertical (I'm not sure why this is the convention.) Also, we assume that a, b, c\nare integers, since all of Section II.4 is under this assumption.\nFix a prime p and define ord(r) for each rational number r as in the book.\nNote that another way of describing C(p ) is as the ordered pairs (t, s) on the\ncurve for which ord(t) and ord(s) 3.\nFirst suppose that P1 P2 = Q is a point at infinity. Since the line ` through\nP1 P2 is vertical, we would have to have Q = [0, 1, 0] in projective T, S, U\ncoordinates. From the homogeneous equation\nU 2S = T 3 + aT 2S + bT S2 + cS3 ,\nthis happens if and only if c = 0.\nWe claim the case above never occurs, as follows. Under our change of\ncoordinates, the point Q corresponds to the point (0, 0) in (x, y)-coordinates.\nIn the (x, y)-plane, the point (0, 0) is a point of order two, and the tangent line\nto the curve at the point (0, 0) is x = 0. Then in the (t, s)-plane, the point Q\n\nalso has order 2 and since the change of coordinates is t = x/y, s = 1/y, the\ntangent line to the curve at Q must be the line t = 0. This is a vertical line,\nso it must be the line ` itself. But ` hits the curve at least twice at Q (since\nit is tangent at Q) and so ` cannot also contain two other points P1, P2 on the\ncurve. This contradiction eliminates this case.\nFrom now on we can assume that c ≤= 0, and that P1 P2 = (t3, s3) is\nnot a point at infinity. Since the line through P1 and P2 is vertical, clearly\nt3 = t1 = t2. Now since the equation of C in (t, s)-coordinates has only odd\npowers of t and s, the curve is symmetric about the origin, i.e. if (t, s) ∗ C\nthen (-t, -s) ∗ C. Since we take O = (0, 0), then from the symmetry it\nis clear that (t, s) O = (-t, -s). So P1 + P2 = (-t3, -s3), and obviously\nord(-t3) = ord(-t1) = ord(t1) . It remains to prove that ord(s3) 3.\nNow, the 3 s-coordinates s1, s2, s3 are the three roots of the equation\ncs + bt1s 2 + (at -1)s + t3 = 0.\nThus (-b/c)t1 = s1 + s2 + s3. Since ord(s1) 3 and ord(s2) 3, we just\nneed to prove that ord(-b/c)t1 3.\nNow write t = t1 for convenience. Since si = t3 + at2si + bts2 + csi for each\ni\ni, we can subtract and factor some terms to get\ns1 -s2 = at2(s1 -s2) + bt(s1 -s2)(s1 + s2) + c(s1 -s2)(s + s1s2 + s2).\nCancelling the factor s1 -s2 (OK since we assumed P1 ≤= P2) and solving for c,\nwe have\nc = (1 -at2 -bt)/(s + s1s2 + s2), so bt/c = bt(s 2 + s1s2 + s2)/(1 -at2 -bt).\nThe presence of the 1 in the denominator implies (since we know ord(t) 1)\nthat ord(1 -at2 -bt) = 0. On the other hand, we have b ∗Z, ord t , and\nord(s2 + s1s2 + s2) 6. So certainly ord(bt/c) 3 as we wished.\n2. Do Exercise 2.10 from the textbook.\nSolution. Let C be the curve y2 = x3 + px where p is a prime number.\nFirst we find the points of order 2. These are the points (x, 0) on the curve, so\nthat x(x2 + p) = 0. Since p is prime, x2 + p = 0 has complex roots, so (0, 0) is\nthe only point of order 2. Of course O = [0, 1, 0] is always point of order 1.\nNow if (x, y) is a point of finite order > 2, then the strong form of the N-L\nTheorem, which you proved in Homework 3, says that x and y are integers, and\ny2|D, where here D = -4p3 . hence y = ±1, ±2, ±p, or ±2p.\nSince y2 > 0 and p > 0, we have x > 0. Since x 1 and p 2, x3 + px 3,\nso y ≤= ±1.\nSuppose y = ±2. Then if x 2 then since p 2, x3 + px 12, a contra\ndiction. So x = 1 is the only possible case here, which forces p = 3. So we have\nidentified some possible candidates for points of finite order:\np = 3 : (1, 2), (1, -2).\n\n2 =\nWe are left with the cases y = ±p or y = ±2p. In either case p2|y\nx(x2 + p). So necessarily either p|x or p|(x2 + p). But in the latter case, p|x2 ,\nso p|x in any case. But then x(x2 + p) p(p2 + p) > p2, so y ≤= ±p.\nWe are left with the case y = ±2p, so 4p2 = x3 + px p3 + p2, which forces\n3p2 p3, and so p 3 and p = 2 or 3. If p = 2, then 16 = x3 + 2x is readily\nseen to have no integer solutions. If p = 3, then we check that 36 = x3 + 3x has\nonly the integer solution x = 3. So we have a few more possible candidates for\npoints of finite order:\np = 3 : (3, 6), (3, -6).\nSo we now assume that p = 3; we need to check if any of the points\nP = (1, 2),\nQ = (3, 6), -P, -Q\nhas finite order on the curve y2 = x3 + 3x. The tangent line at P has slope\n6/4 ≤∗ Z, so it follows that 2P will not have integer coordinates. The tangent\nline at Q has slope 30/12 ≤∗ Z, so 2Q will also not have integer coordinates. By\nthe N-L theorem, neither P nor Q has finite order. But then -P and -Q also\ndo not have finite order.\nSo overall, we have proven that regardless of p, the group of rational points\nof finite order on C is precisely\n{O, (0, 0)}.\n3.(*) Consider the curve\nC : y 2 = x + dx\nwhere d ∗ Z is any integer.\n(a) Exercise 3.7(c) on page 105 of the text gives a table showing what the\ngroup of rational points of finite order on C is, for each possible d. Show that\nthis table is incorrect.\n(b) After some experimentation, make some conjecture about what the cor\nrect table should be.\n(c) Can you prove your conjecture? (The result of Exercise 3.7(a) might be\nhelpful.)\nPartial Solution. This problem is potentially very difficult, but I thought\nit might be fun for you to play with. Once we develop some more techniques,\nwe will be able to solve this in full more easily. So I will not give the entire\nsolution here at this point.\nFor part (a), we note that Exercise 3.7(c) claims that the group of points of\nfinite order on C : y2 = x3 + dx is isomorphic to Z/4Z if d = e4 for some integer\ne.\n\nBut if e = 1, then we have the curve y2 = x3 + x. This has 2 points of order\ndividing 2, namely {O, (0, 0)}. But the discriminant D in this case is -4, so if\n(x, y) has finite order, then y = ±1, ±2 by the strong form of Nagell-Lutz. But\n1 = x3 + x and 4 = x3 + x are readily seen to have no integer solutions. It\nfollows that C has no points of finite order except those of order dividing two,\nand that the full group of points of finite order is isomorphic to Z/2Z. so the\ntable in Exercise 3.7(c) cannot possibly be correct.\nFor part (b), it turns out that the other parts of the table are correct, but\nthat the first line of the table should say the the group of points of finite order\non C : y2 = x3 + dx is isomorphic to Z/4Z if d = 4e4 for some integer e. In\nfact, Exercise 4.9 has the correct statement (although it phrases it differently,\nby assuming that d is not divisible by any fourth power. Actually, it is possible\nto reduce to this case.)\nAs for (c), we'll hopefully see how to do this at a later date."

      "content": "18.704 Fall 2004 Homework 5 Solutions\nAll references are to the textbook \"Rational Points on Elliptic Curves\" by\nSilverman and Tate, Springer Verlag, 1992. Problems marked (*) are more\nchallenging exercises that are optional but not required.\n1. This problem is meant to show that the height function can have subtle\nproperties, even though its definition is very simple.\nFor any integer 1, define\nR() = {q ⊂Q |H(q) }.\nNotice that any q ⊂R() has the form q = m/n where 0 |m| and\n0 |n| . Let #R() be the number of elements in R(). Then we trivially\nget the bound #R() (2 + 1)2 for all , because there are 2 + 1 integers\nm satisfying 0 |m| , and similarly for |n|. Of course this is a severe\novercounting, since different choices of m, n can lead to the same rational number\nq.\n(a) Give a better bound for #R(). More specifically, give a bound of the\nfollowing form:\n#R() 2 + + β for all 1,\nWhere , , β are some constants, and with 3/2.\n(b) Explain how you would go about finding better and better bounds for\n#R() (i.e. with a smaller values of ). You don't have to calculate these\nbounds exactly; I just want you to describe a some kind of algorithm you could\nuse to find them.\n(c) (*) There is a limit to this process: Can you prove Exercise 3.1(b) of the\ntext? (I'm not sure how to do it.)\nSolution. (a) Consider the ordered integer pairs (m, n) with |m| ,\n|n| . As we noted above, there are (2 + 1)2 of these. As (m, n) ranges over\nall such pairs, m/n ranges over the rational numbers q with H(q) . But\nwe are overcounting: First, there is no reason to ever take n = 0, and m = 0\nneed only be taken once. Also, we only need to take points in two out of the\nfour quadrants, so we might as well assume that n 1. This brings the number\ndown: we have 22 points (m, n) with m ≤= 0, n 1, and H(m/n) , and we\n\nX\nX\nalso need one point with m = 0, say (0, 1), bringing us down to 22 + 1 possible\nordered pairs.\nOf course, we can do better, we should only count ordered pairs where m, n\nare relatively prime. But the number of these seems hard to count, so we go\none prime at a time. Let us count the number of ordered pairs (m, n) where\nm ≤= 0, n 1, H(m/n) , and both m, n are divisible by 2. This number\nis 2[/2]2, where [r] means the largest integer less than or equal to r. Since\n2[/2]2 2(( - 1)/2)2, when we throw away these bad ordered pairs, we are\nleft with at most\n#R() 22 + 1 - (2/4)( - 1)2 = (3/2)2 + + β\nwhich is the required bound.\n(b) We can continue in the same way, throwing away next all of the ordered\npairs where both coordinates are divisible by 3. But then we have to count care\nfully, because some of those ordered pairs also have both coordinates divisible\nby 2. In any case we get from this a bound of the form\n#R() 22 + 1 - 2[/2]2 - 2[/3]2 + 2[/6]2\nwhich gives a bound with smaller . We could continue by next considering the\nprime 5, etcetera.\nSo the general algorithm is: consider the first m primes, p1, p2, . . . , pm. Then\none can get an upper bound for #R() by considering a sum of the form\n1 + 22 -\n2[/pi]2 +\n2[/pipj ]2 - · · · + (-1)m2[/p1p2 · · · pm]2 .\n1im\n1i<jm\n(A formula like this is derived by using the \"principle of inclusion/exclusion.\"\nI'm happy if you just gave some idea of the process in words instead of writing\na formula.)\n(c) Most of you successfully solved this problem, which asks you to show that\nlim!1 #R()/2 = 12/κ2 . One way is to calculate the limit of the process\ndescribed in part (b). Another is to express #R() in terms of Euler's α-function\nand use known results about this function. If you didn't get this part and want\nto know the solution, ask a classmate or come talk to me.\n2. Let P be a rational point on the nonsingular curve C in Weierstrass form.\nThis exercise concerns a question one of you had in class: if P has infinite order,\nis it possible for all of the points P, 2P, 3P, . . . to have integer coefficients? You\nwill answer this question in part (c) below.\n(a) Suppose that there is a number N > 0 such that H(mP ) N for\ninfinitely many m 1. Prove that the point P has finite order in the group of\nrational points.\n\n(b) Write mP = (xm, ym) for all m 1. Show that there is a constant\nN > 0 such that |xm| N for infinitely many m 1. (Suggestion: Consider\nthe sequence of points P, 2P, 4P, 8P, . . . and use the formulas for doubling a\npoint. Show that given any point Q, if the x coordinate of Q is very large then\nthe x-coordinate of 2Q must be much smaller in absolute value.)\n(c) Suppose now that mP has integer coordinates for all m 1, in other\nwords xm, ym ⊂Z for all m 1. Show that the point P has finite order in the\ngroup of rational points. (Even if you don't succeed in proving part (b), feel\nfree to assume part (b) is true in your proof of this part.)\nSolution. (a). If such a N exists, then there is a sequence of integers\nm1, m2, . . . such that {miP | i 1} S(N) where\nS(N) = {(x, y) ⊂C(Q)|H(x, y) N}.\nAs we saw in Section III.1, the set S(N) is a finite set (this is more or less\nLemma 1 of that section.) Since there are only finitely many possibilites for\nthe points miP, this forces miP = mj P for some integers mi < mj . But then\n(mj -mi)P = O, so P has finite order.\n(b) On page 31 of the text a doubling formula for the x-coordinate is given.\n→\nIt shows that if Q = (x, y) ⊂C(Q), then setting 2Q = (x , y→) we have\n→\ng(x)\nx = h(x)\nwhere g(x) = x4 + g→(x) and h(x) = 4x3 + h→(x). Here g→(x) has degree 3 and\n→\nh (x) has degree 2 but we will only care about the highest degree terms, since\nfor large x, the lower degree terms are small by comparison. In fact, we can find\nN > 0 such that for all |x| N we have |g→(x)| < |x|4 and |h→(x)| < |x|3 . Then\nfor |x| N it follows that |g(x)| 2|x|4 and |h(x)| 3|x|3 . Then if |x| N,\nwe have |x→| (2/3)|x|.\nIt follows from this that given any point Q = (x, y) ⊂C(Q), then if |x| N,\n→\nwe have 2Q = (x , y→) with |x→| (2/3)|x|. Then we can find n 1 such that\n→\n2nQ = (x , y→) with |x→| N.\nNow recall that we write mP = (xm, ym). Starting with our given point P,\nwe apply the above argument to show that there is some n1 1 such that 2n1 P\nhas x-coordinate N. Then we apply the argument to the point 2n1 P, to show\nthere is some n2 > n1 such that 2n2 P has x-coordinate n. Continuing, we\nget an infinite sequence of numbers n1, n2, . . . such that 2ni P has x-coordinate\nof absolute value N, for all i 1.\n(c) This is a combination of parts (a) and (b). If the points mP = (xm, ym)\nall have integer coordinates, then this implies that H(mP) = |xm| for all m 1.\nThen part (b) implies that there is a number N such that H(mP) N for\ninfinitely many m. Part (a) now says that P has finite order."

We will begin by describing some basic goals and ideas of\ncryptography and explaining the cryptographic usefulness of elliptic curves.\nWe will then discuss the discrete logarithm problem for elliptic curves. We\nwill describe in detail the Baby Step, Giant Step method and the MOV at\ntack. The latter will require us to introduce the Weil pairing. We will then\nproceed to talk about cryptographic methods on elliptic curves. We begin\nby describing the kinds of curves for which the discrete log problem is not\nknown to be easy. We will then introduce the basic cryptographic problem of\nsending and encrypted message, and describe two encryption methods: the\nDiffieHellman Key Exchange, and the MasseyOmura Encryption. We will\nconclude our paper by summing up the results and mentioning briefly some\ndevelopments which we did not have room to address fully in this paper. 1\nBasics of Cryptography\nCryptography aims to analyze which problems can be made easy while mak\ning others hard.[Lu] In practical terms, if I want to send my friend a message\nnobody else will be able to read, I want it to be easy for me to encode, easy\nfor my friend to decrypt, and hard for an adversary to decrypt. One prob\nlem that is thought to be hard, on which many cryptographic systems are\nbased, is the discrete log problem. No fast methods for solving this problem\nin general exist, though it is possible that they will someday be found. The\ndiscrete log problem is more difficult for elliptic curves than for finite fields,\nwhich means that the same size encryption key will yield greater security\nif we use ECC. Put another way, we can use a smaller key to get the same\namount of security, which speeds up the computations we want to speed up\n(i.e. mine and my friend's).\nThis paper will often talk about problems being practical, easy, and\ntractable, or, conversely, impractical, hard, and intractable. A problem is\nconsidered tractable if the computation time is polynomial in the length of\nthe input. For example, say we are working with a group of size N . We can\nthen write down any member of N using log(N ) digits. For the problem\nto be considered tractable, we will then need an algorithm that runs in\ntime that is polynomial in log(N ). An algorithm that runs in time N , for\n1 When no source is cited for a specific item of information, that information generally\ncomes from [Wa].\n\n|\n{z\ninstance, will be much too slow. If we use 1024 bits to write down N, a\nperfectly reasonable number, N can equal 21023 , which is huge.\nDiscrete Logarithm Problem for Elliptic Curves\n3.1\nProblem Statement\nThe classical discrete logarithm problem is the following: Given that there\nk\nis some integer k such that a ≡ b (mod p), where p is prime, find k. Since\nthe order of a must divide p - 1, k can be defined\n(mod p - 1).\nSimilarly, we can define the discrete log problem for elliptic curves.\nSwitching to additive notation, we have the problem of finding k (given\nthat k exists) such that kP = Q, where P, Q are points on the curve E(Fq ),\nwith q = pn for some prime p.\nOur notation is the following: E(Fq ) is the set of points on E whose\ncoordinates lie in Fq . Fq denotes Fpn . We will write E(Fq ) with coefficients\nin Fq . kP is defined as P + P + . . . + P}, with standard addition of points\nk\non elliptic curves.\n3.2\nAttacks on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Prob\nlem\nIn cryptography, an attack is a method of solving a problem. Specifically,\nthe aim of an attack is to find a fast method of solving a problem on which\nan encryption algorithm depends. The known methods of attack on the\nelliptic curve (EC) discrete log problem that work for all curves are slow,\nmaking encryption based on this problem practical. However, several effi\ncient methods for solving the EC discrete log problem for specific types of\nelliptic curves are known. This means that one should make sure that the\ncurve one chooses for one's encoding does not fall into one of the several\nclasses of curves on which the problem is tractable.\nBelow, we describe the Baby Step, Giant Step Method, which works for\nall curves, but is slow. We then describe the MOV attack, which is fast for\ncertain types of curves.\n3.2.1\nBaby Step, Giant Step Method\nThis is one of the fastest general methods of solving the EC discrete log\nproblem. (In fact, it can be applied to an arbitrary group.) The algorithm\n\nruns in approximately\n√\nN time and\n√\nN space, where N = #E(Fq ). This\nis not fast enough to be practical.\nProblem:\nFind k such that kP = Q on E(Fq ), with #E(Fq ) = N, assuming that\nsuch a k exists.\nAlgorithm:\n1. Pick an integer m >\n√\nN.\n2. Compute mP.\n3. For i = 0 to i = m - 1 compute (and store) iP .\n4. For j = 0 to j = m - 1 compute (and store) Q - jmP .\n5. Sort the lists from steps 3, 4 in some consistent way.\n6. Compare the lists from steps 3, 4 until a pair i, j such that iP =\nQ - jmP is found.\n7. Return k ≡ i + jm (mod N).\nProof:\nSince we chose m such that m2 > N, there is a solution k < m2 . Let\nk0 ≡ k (mod m), 0 ≤ k0 < m. Let k1 = (k - k0)/m. Then we have\nk = k0 + mk1, with 0 ≤ k1 < m. In the algorithm given, we try all i in the\nrange of values of k0 and all j in the range for k1 until we find i, j such that\niP = Q - jmP = ⇒ (i + jm)P = Q. Thus the value returned is always a\nsolution, and the algorithm always halts, since k0, k1 must exist.\nTime Analysis:\nStep 1 takes O(log N) time. Steps 2 and 3 take O(m + 1) = O(\n√\nN) and\nΩ(m + 1) = Ω(\n√\nN) time. Step 4 can be done in O(\n√\nN) time as well. The\nsort in step 5 can be performed in O(log(N)\n√\nN) time. Step 6 can then be\ndone in O(\n√\nN) time. Finally, step 7 can also be done in O(\n√\nN), so if we\nignore logarithmic factors (\n√\nN is already large enough for the problem to\nbe intractable), we find that the running time is on the order of\n√\nN. The\nstorage space required is also on the order of\n√\nN, as that is how much space\nis required to store the lists in steps 3 and 4. This algorithm is too slow to\nbe of practical use in breaking codes, as it is exponential in the length log N\nof the input.\n\n3.2.2\nThe MOV Attack\nThe MOV attack (named for Menezes, Okamoto, and Vanstone) reduces the\ndiscrete log problem on an elliptic curve E(Fq ) to the discrete log problem\nin F×\nqm for some m. The problem can then be solved fairly quickly using an\nindex calculus attack (not described in this paper), as long as m is small. A\nsmall m can always be obtained for certain types or curves.\nWe will start by defining a Weil pairing for curves E(F). We will not\nactually prove that such a pairing exists for the curves we are considering.\nConsider E(F), and let N be an integer not divisible by the character\nistic2 of F. Let E[N] be the set of points on the curve with order dividing\nN whose coordinates are in the algebraic closure3 of F. We claim (without\ngiving proof) that E[N] ' Zn ⊕ Zn.\nN\nLet μN = {x ∈ F|x\n= 1}. That is, μN is the group of Nth roots of\nunity in F. Since the characteristic of F doesn't divide N, xN = 1 has no\nmultiple roots, and therefore there are N distinct roots of unity in F.\nDefinition 1: A Weil pairing is a map\neN : E[N] × E[N] → μn\nsuch that\n1. eN is bilinear in each variable.\n2. eN is nondegenerate in each variable. That is, if eN (S, T) = 1 for all\nS, then T = O, and if eN (S, T) = 1 for all T, then S = O.\n3. eN (T, T) = 1∀T.\n4. eN (T, S) = eN (S, T)-1∀S, T.\n5. If σ is an automorphism of F that preserves the coefficients of E, then\neN (σS, σT) = σ(eN (S, T))∀S, T.\n6. If α is a separable endomorphism of E, eN (α(S), α(T)) = eN (S, T)deg α .\n2 The characteristic of a field F is the smallest positive integer p such that p × 1F = 0\nif such a p exits, and 0 otherwise.[Du]\n\nThe algebraic closure of a field F is a field F such that F is algebraic over F and every\n\npolynomial over F splits completely over F.[Du]\n4 O denotes the point at infinity on our curve E(F).\n\nThe following propositions will be useful:\nProposition 1: Let S, T form a basis for E[N]. Then eN (S, T ) is a primi\ntive Nth root of unity.\nProof:\nLet ζ = eN (S, T ), and let d be such that ζd = 1. Then by bilinearity\neN (S, dT ) = eN (S, T )d = ζd = 1. Similarly, eN (T, dT ) = eN (T, T )d = 1d =\n1 by the properties 1 and 3 of eN . For any point P ∈ E[N], P = aS + bT\nfor some a, b ∈ Z. We therefore have eN (P, dT ) = eN (aS + bT, dT ) =\neN (S, dT )aeN (T, dT )b = 1. Since this holds for all points P , by property\n2 we have dT = O. Thus ord(T ) d\nn|d, and therefore ζ = eN (S, T ) is\n|\n⇒\nalways a primitive nth root of unity when S, T form a basis.\nProposition 2: If E[N] ⊆ E(F), then μN ⊂ F.\nLet σ be an automorphism of F such that σ is the identity map on F.\nLet S, T form a basis for E[N]. Since S, T have coefficients in F, by property\n5 of the Weil pairing, we have\nζ = eN (S, T ) = eN (σS, σT ) = σ(eN (S, T )) = σ(ζ).\nBy the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, σ(ζ) = ζ ⇒ ζ ∈ F. By Propo\nsition 1, ζ is a primitive root of unity. Since the above holds for all primitive\nroots of unity ζ, we have μN ⊂ F.\nWe can now describe the MOV attack. Since from algebra we know that\nF q = S\ni≥1 F i , we can pick an m such that E[N] ⊆ E(Fqm ). By the propo\nq\nsition above, we have μN ⊂ Fqm .\nProblem:\nFind k such that kP = Q on E(Fq ), with #E(Fq ) = N, assuming that\nsuch a k exists. Use a reduction of the discrete log problem on the curve\nE(Fq ) to the discrete log problem in F×\nqm .\nAlgorithm:\nUntil lcm(d1, d2, . . . , dk ) = N, perform the following steps, incrementing\ni by 1 for each repetition:\n1. Select a random point Si ∈ E(Fqm ).\n\n2. Compute the order Mi of Si.\n3. Let di = gcd(Mi, N). Let Ti = (Mi/di)Si.\n4. Let ζ1i = eN (P, Ti), ζ2i = eN (Q, Ti).\n5. Solve the discrete log problem ζki = ζ2i in F\n1i\n. This gives\n×\nki\nm\nq\n(mod di).\nNow use the values of ki\n(mod di) to find a k (mod N) such that k ≡ ki\n(mod di)∀i. This is the k we are looking for.\nProof:\nWe can clearly select a point on the curve (step 1), calculate its order\n(step 2), and find Ti (step 3). Note that the order of Ti is di N, so Ti ∈ E[N].\n|\nLet ζ = eN (R, Ti), where R is an arbitrary point on E(Fqm ) and Ti is as in\nstep 3. Then\nζd = eN (R, Ti)d = eN (R, dTi) = eN (R, MiSi) = eN (R, O) = 1,\n= ζki\n1i in F\nand so ζ1, ζ2 ∈ μd ⊆ F\nNow let kP\nQ,\n, and we can solve\n×\nζ2i\nm\nq\n× .\nm\nq\nand define li such that k ≡ li\n(mod di). Then\neN (Q, Ti) ⇒\n=\neN (kP, Ti) = eN (Q, Ti) ⇒\n1i = 1, this implies that ζli\neN (P, Ti)k\nζk\n1i\nζ2i. Since\n=\n=\nζd\n(mod di) ⇒ li ≡ ki\n(mod di), and so k\n(mod di). Thus finding the necessary ki provides the answer\n1i ≡ ζ2i\nmust equal ki\nk.\nTime Analysis:\nWeil pairings can be computed reasonably quickly, and given k ≡ ki\n(mod di), we can reasonably quickly find k (mod N). Thus the running\ntime of this algorithm will be determined by (1) how long it takes to compute\neach ki, and (2) for how many i, ki must be computed.\nThe time it takes to compute each ki depends on the size of the field F ×\nm\nq\nin which it must be computed. The larger m is, the longer the computation\ntakes. There is no general theorem that determines how large an m is\nnecessary for all types of curves. However, we know that for curves such\nthat #E(Fq ) = q + 1 (these curves are called supersingular ), if there exists\na point P ∈ E(Fq ) of order N, then E[N] ⊆ E(Fq2 ). (We omit the proof of\nthis statement.)\nTo answer question (2), we first claim (without proof) that E(Fqm ) '\nZn1 ⊕Zn2 for some n1, n2 with n1 n2. The largest possible order of an element\n|\nin E(Fq ) divides the largest order of an element in E(Fqm ), so N|n2, since\nno element in E(Fqm ) can have order > n2.\n\nLet B1, B2 be points generating E(Fqm ) such that B1, B2 have orders\nn1, n2, respectively. Then any point Si chosen in the algorithm above can\nbe written as a1B1 + a2B2 for some a1, a2 depending on i. Let p be a prime,\ne\ne\ne\nand let p kN. Then p |n2. If p - a2, then p |n2 ⇒ pe Mi, where Mi is\n|\ne\nthe order of Si. Then p |di = gcd(Mi, N). Since Si is picked randomly,\na2 for Si is also random, and so the probability that p - a2 is 1 - 1/p.\ne\ne\nThus the probability that p di is ≥ 1 - 1/p for every i and every p kN.\n|\nThis probability is sufficiently low that only a few di should be needed for\ne\np |lcm(d1, d2, . . . , dk ) to be true for all p. We will therefore not need to\niterate the algorithm too many times.\nCryptographic Methods Using Elliptic Curves\nIn this section, we will describe two cryptographic methods based on the\ndifficulty of the discrete log problem for elliptic curves. Many other methods\nare used as well, but we do not have room to give all of them here. These\nmethods are generally also available over finite fields, but give more security\nper bit of data if elliptic curves are used instead.\n4.1\nChoosing a Curve\nFor each of the cryptographic methods depended on the difficulty of the EC\ndiscrete log problem, we must begin by choosing an elliptic curve that is not\nsusceptible to the known fast attacks on the discrete log problem, such as\nthe MOV attack described in the previous section. The curve must therefore\nsatisfy the following restrictions:\n- There exists a large prime p dividing #E(Fq ), so that the problem is\nnot susceptible to the Pollardρattack. [not presented]\n- #E(Fq ) =6\nq (i.e. the curve is not anomalous). This prevents the prob\nlem from being susceptible to the SemaevSmartSatohAraki attack.\n[not presented]\n- The order of P does not divide qk - 1 for all k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ C,\nwhere C is a sufficiently large constant so that it is difficult to solve\nthe discrete logarithm problem in F×\nC . This is necessary for MOV not\nq\nto generate a solution quickly. [see previous section][Bha]\nThere exist several methods of choosing these curves. The simplest one\nis to pick a curve E(Fq ) : y2 = x3 + ax + b at random by selecting a, b ∈ Fq\n\nsuch that 4a3 + 27b2 =6\n0 if q is odd and b = 0 if q is a power of 2. We\nthen check the conditions given above. A large fraction of the time, the\nconditions will be satisfied. If they are not, we try a different a, b.[Bha]\n4.2\nSetup for Encryption Algorithms\nConsider the following problem of cryptography:\nAlice wants to send Bob a message m, usually assumed to be an integer.\nHowever, she does not want the eavesdropper Eve to be able to read the\nmessage as well. Therefore, Alice uses and encryption key to encrypt the\nmessage, and sends the resulting cyphertext (rather then the plaintext) to\nBob. Bob then uses a decryption key to decrypt they message. Obviously,\nEve must be prevented from finding the decryption key, as otherwise she\nwould also be able to decode the message.\nThere are two possibilities in this scenario. Perhaps Alice and Bob were\nable to communicate secretly in advance and agree on a key, and perhaps\nthey were not. If they were, the encryption and decryption keys may be the\nsame. If they were not, they must establish a public encryption key that\nallows Alice to encode the message and a different private decryption key\nthat allows Bob to decrypt the message.\n4.3\nDiffieHellman Key Exchange\nThe following series of steps describes the DiffieHellman Key Exchange, a\npublic key encryption system that allows Alice and Bob to set up a sym\nmetric private key. Since the symmetric systems are generally faster than\nthe public key systems, this is quite useful.\n1. Alice and Bob publicly agree on E(Fq ), chosen so that the discrete\nlog problem is hard, as described above. They also agree on a point\nP ∈ E(Fq ) of high (usually prime) order.\n2. Alice chooses a secret a ∈ Z, computes aP , and sends it to Bob.\n3. Bob chooses a secret b ∈ Z, computes bP , and sends it to Alice.\n4. Alice computes a(bP ) = abP .\n5. Bob computes b(aP ) = abP .\n6. Alice and Bob now have the same point abP . They use a publicly\nagreed on method, such as taking the last 256 bits of the ycoordinate\nof the point, to extract a key.\n\nWithout performing a detailed analysis, we see that no step in the algo\nrithm above will be intractable.\nIn order to obtain the key as well, Eve needs to find abP from the\npublicly available P, aP, bP ∈ E(Fq ). This is known as the DiffieHellman\nProblem. If Eve could solve the discrete log problem on E(Fq ), she could\nsolve kP = (aP ) to obtain a, and then multiply bP by a to get abP . It is\nnot known, however, whether Eve could compute abP in some other way\nthat does not require solving the discrete log problem.\nThe Decision DiffieHellman Problem asks if given P, aP, bP, Q ∈ E(Fq )\nEve can determine whether or not Q = abP . As it turns out, the Weil\npairing can be used to answer this question for some types of elliptic curves.\n4.4\nMasseyOmura Encryption\nNow consider the situation in which Alice wants to send Bob a message Eve\nwill be unable to read. Alice and Bob have not communicated privately to\nset up a key. Conceptually, the following algorithm will work: Alice sends\nBob a box with her lock on it. Bob adds his own lock and sends the box\nback. Alice removes her lock and sends the box on to Bob. Bob removes his\nlock and reads the message. This method can be implemented using elliptic\ncurves:\n1. Alice and Bob publicly agree on E(Fq ), chosen so that the discrete log\nproblem is hard, as described above. Let N = #E(Fq ).\n2. Alice represents her message as a point P ∈ E(Fq ).\n3. Alice chooses a secret a ∈ Z such that gcd(a, N ) = 1, computes aP ,\nand sends it to Bob.\n4. Bob chooses a secret b ∈ Z such that gcd(b, N ) = 1, computes b(aP ) =\nbaP , and sends it to Alice.\n5. Alice finds a-1 ∈ Zn, computes a-1(baP ) = a-1baP , and sends it to\nBob.\n6. Bob finds b-1 ∈ Zn, computes b-1(a-1baP ) = b-1a-1baP , and takes\nthe result to be the message.\nWithout performing a detailed analysis, we see that no step given above\nwill take 'too long.'\n\nTo show that the above encryption method is valid, we need to show\nthat (1) Alice can represent her message as a point on E(Fq ) and (2) that\nb-1a-1baP = P . It is clear that all the other steps can be performed.\nWe will give a method for encoding a message m as a point P on a\ncurve E(Fp) : y2 = x3 + Ax + B (given in Weierstrass normal form). A\nsimilar method exists for E(Fq ). As always, we assume that the message is\nan integer.\nLet m be a message such that 0 ≤ m < p/100. For i = 0 to 99 let\nxi = 100m + i. Compute each si = x3 + Axi + B for i in the range. It is\ni\npossible to test whether si is a square and compute its square root if it is.\nIf si is a square, we're done, as we can use the point P = (xi, yi) on our\ncurve, where yi is the root of si. The message m can then be obtained from\nP by simply taking bxic. si is an essentially random element of F×, which is\np\ncyclic and has even order (pick an odd p), so the probability of each si being\na square is about 1/2. Therefore, the probability that some si is a square is\n1 - 2-100 , which is quite high. We could obviously have used 10k for some\nk > 2 in place of 100 to increase this probability, but that is unnecessary. If\nno si is a square, pick another curve.\nTo show that b-1a-1baP = P , it is enough to show that a-1aR = R for\nR ∈ E(Fq ), as the a's and b's commute and are symmetric.\nNote that we chose a such that gcd(a, N ) = 1, so a-1 exists. a-1a ≡ 1\n(mod N ) by the definition of a-1, so a-1a = 1 + kN for some k. Since the\ngroup E(Fq ) has order N , R ∈ E(Fq ) has order dividing N , and therefore\nN R = O. Thus a-1aR = (1 + kN )R = R + k(N R) = R + kO = R, as\nneeded.\nLet a0 = a-1, b0 = b-1, P 0 = abP . The eavesdropper Eve then knows\nP, a0P, b0P and needs to find a0b0P , which is again the DiffieHellman prob\nlem, as in the previous encryption method.\nConclusion\nWe have now given a basic introduction to Elliptic Curve Cryptography.\nWe introduced the discrete log problem. We then gave a general, but slow\nmethod of attack on this problem. There exist methods that take constant\nrather than\n√\nN space, but there are no know general methods that run\nfaster than\n√\nN time. This means that the EC discrete log problem is hard.\nIt is known to be easy only for a few specific classes of elliptic curves, such\nas supersingular curves (due to the MOV attack). When using an EC for\nencryption, it is easy to pick one that does not fall into any of these classes.\n\nTwo basic encryption methods were presented in this paper. Along the\nway, we defined a Weil pairing, which is very useful in ECC. In addition to\nthe results given above for which it is relevant, there is also an encryption\nmethod based on Weil pairings. We have shown that ECC is a useful and\ntheoretically interesting field.\n\nReferences\n[Bha] Bhandari, A. K.; Nagraj, D.S.; Ramkrishna, B.; Venkataramana, T.\nN. (editors).

      "content": "On 1-dimensional Group Variety\nAbstract\nWe discuss abelian variety and use it to generalize the concept of elliptic curve we\ndiscussed in the class. We state some of the basic properties of abelian variety and\nin particular 1-dimensional abelian variety. The main result of this report is to\nshow that elliptic curve is that the only 1-dimensional abelian variety.\n1. Introduction\nThe main purpose of this paper is to characterize elliptic curve. In the class, we\ndiscuss the properties of elliptic curves, especially rational points on elliptic curves\nwhere we define elliptic curves to be curves on projective spaces over complex\nnumbers or finite fields which is the vanishing set of homogeneous polynomial of\ndegree 3. The main tool we use to study elliptic curve is that we define a group\nstructure on all the points of an non-singular elliptic curve of which rational points\nare a subset. We also show that the group is isomorphic to torus. We also see\nthat on a singular elliptic curve, we can define a group structure on all points\nexcept the points of singularity. We see that the fact that non-singular elliptic\ncurve have a everywhere defined group structure make it different from singular\nelliptic curves. For example, the rational points on non-singular elliptic curves are\nfinitely generated but it is not true for singular elliptic curves. As a result, we\nwould like to know if non-singular elliptic curves are the only curves with a group\nstructure for all points on the curve. The purpose of this paper is to show that in\nfact, this characterized elliptic curves. In this paper, we study some property of\ngroup variety and generalize concept of curves to be 1-dimensional group variety.\nIn this more generalized treatment, we give a new definition of elliptic curves which\nis equivalent to the old definition if we restrict ourselves to the special case we\nconsidered in the class. Then we end our paper with the main theorem that elliptic\ncurves is the only complete 1-dimensional group variety, which if we restrict ourself\nto curve on complex numbers, will implies that torus is the only compact curve\nwith (everywhere defined) group structure.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In the second section, we introduce\nthe notion of variety following the approach of Hartshorne [2]. In third section,\nwe discuss some basic properties of group variety which are varieties with a group\nstructure following Serge Lang's book [1]. Afterward, we spend the rest of paper\non curve, which is 1-dimensional group variety. In the fourth section, we introduce\nthe divisors on a 1-dimensional variety and use it to define the genus of a curve\nwhich is a important invariant of curve. In the fifth section, we construct. the\nJacobi variety for a curve. In the the last section, we use the universal property\nof Jacobi variety for a curve to prove that elliptic curve is the only 1-dimensional\nabelian variety.\nThroughout the paper the underlying field K is assumed to be of characteristic\nzero and is algebraically closed. We will use the notation An\nK for the direct sum of\nn copy of K.\n2. Algebraic Variety\nIn this section, we define what is an algebraic variety. First, we consider the spe\ncial case of affine variety. Roughly speaking, an affine variety is the space common\n\nroots of a collection of polynomials of n variables. However, to be precise, we need\nto specify what kind of topology we have one the space and what kind of maps we\nallow between the spaces.\nLet R be the polynomial ring over K with n variable.\nDefinition 1. Given an ideal I of R, define the vanishing set V(I) to be\nV(I) = {x → An\nK≥f (x) = 08f → I}\n(1)\nIt is not hard to see that if we let I range from all ideals of R {V(I)} satisfies the\naxiom of closed subset for a topology and forms a topology on An\nK. More precisely,\nwe can show that:\n(i) An\nK and α are of the form V(I) for some I\n(2)\nV({0}) = A\n(3)\nV(R) = ;\nn\nK\n(ii)the collection is closed under finite union since\n(4)\nV(I)\n\nV(I) = V(IJ )\n(iii) the collection is closed under arbitrary intersection since\n(5)\n\\\nV(Is) = V(I)\ns2S\nwhere I is the ideal generated by {Is}.\nDefinition 2. The Zariski topology of An\nK is the topological space An\nK with closed\nsets {V(I)}\nDefinition 3. An affine variety is a subset V(I) of An\nK whose topology is induced\nby Zariski topology of An\nK.\nNow that we define the topology of affine variety, we want to specify the maps\nbetween affine variety we want to consider. Notice that we define the variety and\nthe topology on it by vanishing set of collection of polynomials. As a result, we\nwould like to restrict maps between affine varieties to be polynomial maps.\nDefinition 4. Given a affine variety V which is contained in An\nK for some n, a map\nG : V ∗⊕ K is regular if and only if it is restriction of a polynomial F : An\nK ∗⊕ K\nDefinition 5. Given two affine variety U and V , a map F : U ∗⊕ V is regular if\nand only if for every regular map G : V ∗⊕ K, the composition F · G is regular.\nNotice that regular maps are continuous maps under Zariski topology.\nSimilarly, we can define regular maps.\nDefinition 6. Given a affine variety V which is contained in An\nK for some n, a\nmap G : V ∗⊕ K is regular if and only if around every point p of V , the map is\nrestriction of it is restriction of a map F : U ∗⊕ K , U open set of An\nK contains p\nand F is f1/f2 where fi are polynomials.\nDefinition 7. We say that a map F between two affine varieties X and Y is rational\nif and only for any ration for every rational map G : V ∗⊕ K, the composition G · F\nis rational.\n\nWe defined the affine varieties as above. Now we are ready to define algebraic\nvarieties, which roughly speaking, are spaces that are locally the same as affine\nvariety. The idea is similar to that of gluing Euclidean spaces together to get\nmanifolds.\nDefinition 8. A topological space X is an algebraic variety if there exists an\nindex set I and an open covering of X by {Ui}, i → I and affine varieties {Vi} and\nhomeomorphisms {αi : Vi ∗⊕ Ui} such that on intersection Uij of Ui and Uj\n(6)\nα-\nj\n1αi : α-\ni\n1(Uij ) ∗⊕ α-\nj\n1(Uij )\nare regular functions. We say that Ui are the open affine subset of X.\nDefinition 9. Given two algebraic varieties X and Y , a map F : X ∗⊕ Y is a\nrational morphism if for every open affine Ui of X and Uj\n0 of Y so that F (Ui) is\ncontained in Uj\n0 the composition of αi, F and α -1 between affine variety Vi and V 0\nj\nj\nis rational map of affine variety.\nExample\n(i)As an example, we may notice that the projective plane P 2 is an algebraic\nK\nvariety since it is covered by three copy of A2 where the i-th copy is the subset of\nK\nP 2 whose i-th coordinate is non-zero.\nK\n(ii) An elliptic curve on P 2 is an algebraic variety since it is covered by three\nK\nsubset that are affine variety defined by the vanishing point of a degree 3 polynomial\nof two variables.\nDefinition 10. An algebraic variety is irreducible if it cannot be expressed as union\nof proper closed subset of itself.\nWe will state the following lemma without proof:\nLemma 1. Product of two algebraic varieties is an algebraic variety\n3. Group Variety and Abelian Variety\nWe show in class that we can define a group structure on non-singular elliptic\ncurves. We see in the previous section that elliptic curves are special examples of\nalgebraic variety. The purpose of this section is to generalize this idea to arbitrary\nalgebraic variety.\nRecall that a group is a set G with an associative operation G × G ∗⊕ G so that\nthe unit and inverse element exists.\nA group variety is an irreducible algebraic variety with a group structure such\nthat the group structure is compatible with the structure of variety. Moreover, we\nhave the following definition:\nDefinition 11. A group variety is an irreducible algebraic variety A with a rational\nmap F : A × A ∗⊕ A such that F gives a group structure on A. In addition we\nrequire that the map\n(7)\n: A ∗⊕ A\nx ∗⊕ x -1\nis an rational map from A to A\nLemma 2. A group variety is non-singular.\n\nProof. Given g → A, define the map Tg from A to A to be multiplied by g from\nthe left. Tg and Tg-1 are isomorphism of an open set around the identity and an\nopen set around g. Thus, if g is singular if and only if identity is. However, we can\nnot have a algebraic variety which is everywhere singular. Thus A group variety is\nnon-singular.\n\nDefinition 12. We say that a group variety is commutative if the group is a\ncommutative group\nExample A non-singular elliptic curve (in the sense we discussed in class) is a\nexample of a group variety of dimension 1 since we defined a group structure on\nthe curve that is defined by quotient of polynomials. Notice that we defined similar\nstructure on a singular elliptic curve but the product is defined only for non-singular\npoints of the curve. Thus, non-singular points on a singular elliptic curve also form\na group variety. The two examples here are distinguished by the fact that a non-\nsingular elliptic curve is a complete space (under the induced topology of Zariski\ntopology) but the non-singular points on a singular elliptic curve is not a complete\nspace. We see in the class that the properties of non-singular elliptic curve and\nsingular elliptic are very different. As a result, we have the following definition of\nabelian variety.\nDefinition 13. A group variety A is an abelian variety if A is complete as a variety.\nAt first, the word \"abelian\" might seems to be confusing since we usually use\nabelian to mean that a group is commutative. However, this is somewhat justified\nby the following theorem:\nTheorem 3. (Theorem 1, Ch. 2 [1]) An abelian variety A is a commutative group\nvariety.\nWe omit the proof of the theorem.\n4. divisors and genus of curves\nWe said previously that the main topics of interests is 1-dimensional group vari\nety. In the following of the report, we call \"a 1-dimensional group variety\" a curve.\nNotice that if the underlying field is the complex number, then a curve is of complex\ndimension 1 or equivalently real dimension 2. In fact, we show in the class in the\nclass that an elliptic curve over C is the torus. Moreover, we know that we can\nassociate a bi-rational invariant number g, called the genus, to each affine curve\nover C which if visualized geometrically is the number if holes of the curves. For\nexample, a torus is of genus 1. Genus is an important number associated to affine\ncurve over C since we know that it classify the affine curve over C. The purpose\nof this section is to generalize the definition of genus to all curves using divisors on\ncurves.\nFirst, we will state a theorem from [2] which allow us to consider only curves\nthat are subset of projective spaces P n .\nTheorem 4. (Corollary 3.6. Ch. 6 [2]) Every curve can be embedded into P 3\nK\nWe will first define the a divisor on a curve C\n\nX\nDefinition 14. A divisor D on a curve C is a formal sum of the form\nnipi\npi 2C\nwhere all but finitely many ni are zero. If we have two divisor\nDi =\nX\nnj,ipj ,\ni = 1, 2\npj2C\nthen we can naturally define the sum of the two divisors to be\n(8)\nD1 + D2 =\nX\n(ni,1 + ni,2)pi\npi 2C\nIn this sense, the sets of all divisors D of C is the free abelian group generated by\npoints of the curve C\nIn particular, 0 is a divisor. We can define the degree of an divisor to be:\nDefinition 15. The degree of a divisor Dis defined by the following equation\n(9)\ndeg(D) =\nX\nni\nD =\nX\nnipi\npi 2C\nDefinition 16. Given a rational function f on C, we want to associate a divisors\nof C to f . Notice that locally, f is defined by a quotient of two polynomials. Thus,\nlocally, around a point p → C, we have f = g1/g2 where gi are polynomials. Thus,\nif g1(p) = 0 we can define the multiplicity of f at p to be the multiplicity of the\npolynomial g1 at p, if g2(p) = 0 we define it to be negative of multiplicity of the\npolynomial g2 at p and we define the multiplicity to be 0 otherwise. Denote by\nvp(f ) the multiplicity of f at p.\nWe have the following lemma\nLemma 5. For all but finitely many points p → C, vp(f ) = 0 if f is not 0.\nSince only finite points have non-zero multiplicity for a given function f we can\nassociate a divisor to f as follows.\nDefinition 17. Given a rational function f on C,\n(10)\ndiv(f ) =\nX\nvp(f )p\np2C\nWe have the following lemma\nLemma 6. Divisors correspond to a rational function is of degree 0. That is\n(11)\ndeg(div(f )) = 0\nDefinition 18. We say that two divisors D1 and D2 are linear dependent if there\nexists a rational function f such that\n(12)\nD1 - D2 = div(f )\nIt follows that linear dependent divisors have the same degree\nWe can define an ordering on the set of divisor, by\nDefinition 19. D1 ∀ D2 if np,1 ∀ np,2 for every p → C. We say that a divisor D\nis positive if D ∀ 0 and D is not 0.\n\nConversely, to every divisors D, we can associate a subspace of rational function\non C denoted by L(D).\nDefinition 20. L(D) consists of function 0 alone with all functions f so that\n(13)\ndiv(f ) + D ∀ 0\nas divisors on C\nIt is straight-forward to see the following lemma:\nLemma 7. L(D) is a K-vector space.\nThus we can define\n(14)\nl(D) = dimK (L(D))\nWe have the following theorem:\nTheorem 8. (Ch. 3, theorem 5 [3]) L(D) is finite dimensional vector space, i.e,\nl(D) is finite.\nWe would like to relate differential 1-forms on C with divisors on C. Given a\ndifferential forms !, locally in a affine open affine set Ui of C, it can be expressed\nas\n(15)\n! = gi ∅ dxi\nMoreover, on intersection of two sets Ui and Uj , gi and gj is related by the\ndet(xi/dxj ) which is non-zero since this is the transformation function on the in\ntersection. As a result, gi and gj have same multiplicity on points p → Uij . As\na result, ! defines a divisor on C. There is one form ! that generates generates\n1-form module exact 1-forms. We call the divisor KC correspond to such ! to be\ncanonical divisor of C . And we define the genus of C to be l(KC ). which is finite\nsince for every D, l(D) is finite.\nExample Although this definition of genus seems to be very different to what we\nhad for real surfaces. However, they are in fact the same definition. For example, in\nchapter 6.4 [3] it is proved that a curve in projective plane defined by homogeneous\npolynomial of degree d has genus (d-1)(d-2)/2 in the new definition. In particular,\nelliptic (torus) is defined by homogeneous polynomial of degree 3 thus has genus 1\nas we expected.\nSince when they underlying field is C, elliptic curve is the (unique) curve of genus\n1 and we know that an elliptic curve is an abelian variety. Thus, it is reasonable\nfor us to generalize elliptic curve in the following way:\nDefinition 21. An elliptic curve is an 1-dimensional abelian variety of genus 1.\nWe would like to show that, in fact, a 1-dimensional abelian variety is an elliptic\ncurve. That is, we want to show that an 1-dimensional abelian variety always has\ngenus 1.\nAlthough this might seems to be redundant, this conclusion is useful. For ex\nample, this shows that there does not exist a everywhere defined group structure\non double torus since it has genus 2. More generally, since the only complex curve\nof genus 1 is torus, thus the only complex curve with a everywhere defined group\nstructure is a non-singular torus.\n\n5. Jacobi variety for curves\nWe will construct the Jacobi variety for curves(group variety of dimension 1) in\nthis section and use it to prove that a 1-dimensional abelian variety is an elliptic\ncurve. We follow the construction in section 1 chapter 2 of [1]\nBefore we do the construction, let us first see the universal property that char\nacterized the Jacobi variety for a curve.\nGiven a curve C, the Jacobi variety is an abelian variety J with a rational map\nF : C ∗⊕ J having the universal property that for any ration map from C to\nabelian varieties factor through F , that is, for any abelian variety V and rational\nmap g : C ∗⊕ V , there exists an unique homomorphism of abelian variety h : J ∗⊕ V\nsuch that g = h(F )\nNotice that given a curve C, the Jacobi variety of C, if exists will be unique, since\nif there are two abelian variety J1 and J2 with Fi : C ∗⊕ Ji both have the universal\nproperty. Then using the universal property for the pair (F1, J1) to F2 : C ∗⊕ J2,\nwe have a homomorphism from 1 : J2 ∗⊕ J1 with F2 = 1(F1). Similarly there are\n2 : J1 ∗⊕ J2 with F1 = 2(F2). Then notice that\n(16)\nF1 = 2(1(F1))\nHowever, apply universal property for the pair (F1, J1) to F1 : C ∗⊕ J1, we conclude\nthat 2(1) is identity map on J1. Similarly 1(2) is identity map on J2. Thus\n2 and 1 are inverse isomorphism to each other, so we have that J1 is isomorphic\nto J2. Thus we proved the uniqueness. As a result, given a curve C, we can, in\nfact just take the universal property as the definition of Jacobi variety. We want to\nshow that Jacobi variety for any curve exists. We will construct it as follows.\nFix a curve C with genus g We will have state the following lemma that is\nimportant to the construction:\nLemma 9. (Lemma 5 Ch. 2 [1]) Suppose we have a curve C of genus g and a\ndivisor D of degree 0 on C. For any positive divisor p of degree g, that is\n(17)\np =\ng\nX\ni=1\nPi\nThere is an unique positive divisor q such that q is linear dependent to a + p In\nparticular, since q is also positive divisor of degree g, we have\n(18)\nq =\ng\nX\ni=1\nQi\nThe proof of the above lemma use the following equation for a divisor b on C\n(19)\nl(b) = deg(b) + 1 - g + ω(b)\nwhere\n(20)\nω(b) = l(Kc - b)\nThe equation is resulted from Riemann-Roch Theorem but we will not prove the\nlemma or Riemann-Roch Theorem here.\nHowever, we will use the lemma to construct a group structure on the set J of\npositive divisor of C with degree g, which as a set is C g , the ordinary product of g\ncopies of C.\n\nFix an element O → J . For two elements p and q of J , applying Lemma (9)\nwhere p is a positive divisor with degree g and q - O is an divisor of degree 0, we\nconclude that there is a unique divisor m of degree g linear dependent to p + q - O.\nBy definition, we have m → J . Thus since m is unique, we define the product of p\nand q to be m. Thus we define a operation\n(21)\n: J × J ∗⊕ J\nwe use the notation so that we do not confuse it with the ordinary addition of\ndivisors.\nWe claim that (J, ) is a commutative group.\nFirst, clearly, O is the identity since p + O - O is p for any p and thus\np O = p\nGiven three elements of J , p1, p2 and p3, notice that both (p1 p2) p3 and\np1 (p2 p3) are linearly dependent to\np1 + p2 + p3 - 2O\nand thus we have the associativity that\n(p1 p2) p3 = p1 (p2 p3)\nThe inverse of an element p exists since by Lemma (9), there is unique element q\nof J linear dependent to\n(O - p) + O\nthus (p - O) + q is linearly dependent to O. Thus\np q = O\nis commutative since given p and q, both p q and q p are linear dependent to\np + q - O, and thus\np q = q p\nAlso, we have the map F : C ∗⊕ V defined by\nF = id × id × · · · × id\nwhere id is the identity map from C to C.\nIn fact, J is a abelian variety of dimension g and that the map F from C to J\nsatisfy the universal property of Jacobi variety. We do not prove it in this report\nand refer the reader to chapter 2 of [1]. By the uniqueness of Jacobi variety variety\nof curve, this is the Jacobi variety of C and we conclude the following theorem:\nTheorem 10. Given a curve C of genus g, the Jacobi variety J of C is of dimension\ng.\n6. Main Theorem of Elliptic Curve\nNow, it is very easy for us prove the following theorem\nTheorem 11. Every 1-dimensional abelian variety is of genus 1, that is, an elliptic\ncurve.\n\nProof. Given a 1-dimensional abelian variety V of genus g, V is a curve with genus\ng and thus we conclude from Theorem (10) that the Jacobi variety of V is g-\ndimensional. However, since V is itself abelian, we can easily see that the identity\nmap id : V ∗⊕ V has the universal property, i.e. V with identity map is the Jacobi\nvariety of V and by definition, V is 1-dimensional. Thus g = 1 and V is an elliptic\ncurve.\n\nReferences\n[1] Abelian Varieties, Serge Lang, New York, Springer-Verlag, 1983.\n[2] Algebraic Geometry.

      "content": "F R O N T M AT T E R\nBest Kept Secrets:\nElliptic Curves and Modern Cryptosystems\nThomas Coffee\nMIT 18.704 Fall 2004\nIntroduction\nIn just a few short decades, we have seen the most seemingly obscure branches of mathematics\nseized upon as vital foundations for modern commercial and social activity in the burgeoning\ninformation age. Realms of algebra and number theory previously the exclusive province of\nprofessional mathematicians are now the basis of patents, industries, and dedicated government\nagencies. Cryptography, the science of secrets, has suddenly caught up with the frontiers of\nacademic theory, and is driving the development of mathematical machinery previously\nexplored in the context of apparently esoteric results like Fermat's Last Theorem. Valuable and\noften widespread practices now rest upon other difficult and unsolved problems that remain.\nSomewhat unexpectedly, the theory of elliptic curves has emerged as a key player in the crypto\ngraphic landscape of the modern world. In this paper, we will show how the rich algebraic\nstructures built upon these curves underlie the state of the art in modern cryptosystems.\nFoundations of Cryptography\nCommunication channels are vulnerable to eavesdropping. Information in our universe has a\ntendency to diffuse and dissipate, and enormous resources are required to counteract this ten\ndency. Encrypting the information itself renders physical security unnecessary: eavesdropping is\nuseless if one cannot understand the information on the channel.\nThis function is performed by means of a cryptosystem, shown in (1). Alice has a class of mean\ningful messages T that she might wish to send to Bob; these are called plaintext messages. To\nprotect these from eavesdropping during transmission, she uses a mapping f to encode these as\ncorresponding messages from a different class G; these are called ciphertext messages. Bob\nmust be able to reconstruct the plaintext from the ciphertext, applying the inverse mapping f -1.\nWe wish to prevent anyone else from applying f -1 and thereby recovering the plaintext.\nf -1\nAlice T øøø o\nf\nG\no\nøøøøø\nT Bob\n(1)\nThe mappings f and f -1 may be generally defined by a structure along with specifying parame\nters. The structure is the component of the cryptosystem that is difficult to change (it may be\nimplemented in permanent devices or conventions). We assume that the structure is universally\nknown: otherwise its revelation would permanently compromise the system. The parameters\n\nThomas Coffee\nFoundations of Cryptography\nmay be easily altered in order to achieve many distinct potential mappings within the structure;\nhence, the system may depend upon secret parameters without catastrophic risk.\nThe Computational Complexity Gap\nAn eavesdropper Eddy will generally attempt to determine f -1 so that he can read all messages\non the channel. Eddy may have a variety of information available to him. He will presumably\nhave information about certain regularities among the potential messages in T (for example,\nword frequencies in English), and about the structure of f and f -1 . Since the channel is vulnera\nble, we assume he will have some arbitrary samples of ciphertext messages. He may also have\ninformation about the corresponding plaintext for some samples. With greater influence or\naccess, he may be able to select the plaintext or ciphertext for some of these samples at his own\ndiscretion. (If he has access to an implementation of f , he will be able to generate unlimited\nsamples on chosen plaintext.)\nA good cryptosystem must be difficult to break, yet not overly burdensome to use. Given the\ninformation available to Eddy, it will take him a certain amount of computational effort to\ndetermine f -1 with some high probability. Clearly, Alice and Bob wish to make this effort very\nlarge. However, the same structural changes that drive the effort required for Eddy to determine\nf -1 can also drive the computational effort required for Alice and Bob to use their system for\ncommunications.\nHence, cryptosystem design is driven by maximizing the gap between the computational require\nments of eavesdroppers and users. In algorithmic terms, this means the cryptosystem must\nallow Alice and Bob to perform their operations with significantly lower asymptotic complexity\n(with respect to the parameters) than that required for Eddy to crack the system. The necessary\nmagnitude of the gap is driven by the value of information to all parties, that is, the investment\nof computational resources that can each be expected of Alice, Bob, and Eddy. It is also driven\nby the cost of computation: if all parties' computational resources for a given investment\nincrease uniformly, the feasible scale of parameters will increase, and a system with a given\ncomplexity gap will become more secure. The dramatic cost reductions in computer hardware\nof the past few decades have multiplied the value of the complexity gap enormously.1\nThe Trouble with Secret Keys\nTraditional cryptography assumes that the forward mapping f and the inverse mapping f -1 can\nbe easily derived from one another (that is, with low asymptotic complexity in the parameters).\nHence both Alice and Bob must know f and f -1 , but no one else can know either. This is\nknown as symmetric or secret-key cryptography.\nSecret-key cryptography has one important disadvantage: in order to agree upon their secret key\nf , Alice and Bob must establish a physically secure communication channel. As we have dis\ncussed, the costs of doing this can often be large, depending upon the degree of protection\ndesired. The number of such secure channels required to set up pairwise private communica\n\nThomas Coffee\nFoundations of Cryptography\ntions among a group of n people grows as OIn2M; to include each individual on the planet as of\nthis writing would require ~1019 such exchanges.\nThe problem is actually even worse, because the secret keys have limited lifespan. The complex\nity gap is finite, and increases in available computational power drive parameter size rapidly\nupward. A set of parameters providing ~1-second encryption and decryption time for Alice and\nBob while forcing ~1-year cracking time for Eddy in the year 2000 may allow ~1-second crack\ning time for Eddy by the year 2025 for the same investment. Implementing a system with param\neters robust until 2025 may cost Alice and Bob ~10-minute encryption and decryption back in\n2000, unacceptable for operational use. Hence keys must be replaced on a regular basis, depend\ning upon the time value of information and developments in computing hardware. Note that a\nlarger complexity gap is the only hope for longer security horizons given fixed investments\namong all parties.\nA New Class of Cryptosystems\nIn 1976, Diffie and Hellman introduced an alternative type of cryptosystem in which f -1 can\nnot be easily determined from f . In this scheme, Bob can generate f and f -1 on his own, then\nmake f freely available without revealing f -1 to anyone. No physically secure channels are\nrequired, since the mapping f is made public. In addition, Bob's unique knowledge of the\ninverse mapping f -1 allows him to authenticate his own messages, which Alice and others can\nverify using f . This approach is known as asymmetric or public-key cryptography. For obvious\nreasons, f is called the public key and f -1 is called the private key.\nThe enormous practical advantages of public-key cryptography come at two key costs. First, to\nenable new senders to contact him without secure exchange, Bob must completely reveal the\nmapping f : this gives Eddy all the information he could possibly desire short of the inverse\nmapping itself, with the exception of chosen-ciphertext samples. Second, to enable new recipi\nents to easily enter the arena, people like Bob must be able to generate public/private key pairs\nwith only modest effort: that is, generating as well as operating the system must be substan\ntially easier than cracking the system. The result is intense pressure on both these forms of the\ncomplexity gap.3\nA function that is difficult to invert is called a one-way function, and many types are well\nknown. For public-key cryptography, however, we need something somewhat more specialized.\nFirst, we need a one-way function that Bob can invert easily given an additional (secret) piece\nof information, known as a trapdoor one-way function. In other words, the inverse mapping\nmust be a hard problem to which Bob has the solution, or something computationally close to it.\nSecond, Bob must be able to generate the problem and its solution quickly, without making the\nproblem easy to solve.\n\nThomas Coffee\nHard Problems with Simple Holes\nHard Problems with Simple Holes\nGiven the steep requirements of public-key cryptosystems, we begin to see how we might wind\nup dealing with some of the most sophisticated mathematical problems yet known. Even after\nwe have found a candidate trapdoor one-way function--a nontrivial task in itself--we must be\nable to provide assurances about the computational simplicity of generating key pairs, and about\nthe computational difficulty of inverting the public key. The latter problem is so challenging, in\nfact, that none of the public-key cryptosystems widely used today are provably secure: they\nhave simply resisted attack for long enough to inspire confidence. Here we introduce the two\ngeneral techniques underlying these systems.4\nInteger Factorization\nThe most well-known public-key algorithm was first published by Rivest, Shamir, and Adle\nman, hence is known as RSA. It is based on the supposed difficulty of performing general\ninteger factorization. The algorithm runs as follows:\n(1) Find two large primes p and q and let n = p y q . Then fHnL a H p - 1L Hq - 1L.\n(2) Find an integer e < n such that gcdHe, fHnLL a 1.\n(3) Find an integer d such that e y d a 1 Hmod fHnLL.\n(4) Define f : Zn o Zn by f HxL = xeHmod nL, then f -1HxL a xd Hmod nL.\nWe first verify the soundness of the algorithm. Fermat's Little Theorem implies that\nxkyfHnL a 1 Hmod pL and Hmod qL for any integer k , hence likewise Hmod nL.5 The condition in (2)\nensures that (3) is possible. Given (3), we have f -1H f HxLL a xdye a x1+k fHnL a x Hmod nL.\nThe public key is determined by n and e, the private key by n and d . Hence the security of the\nalgorithm rests on the difficulty of determining d from n and e alone.6 Unlike Eddy, Bob\nknows the factorization of n, which he uses to find fHnL and then d via (3). The complexity gap\nis largely determined by the driving algorithms of each task:\nA Generating the system: discovering unpublished primes\nA Operating the system: computing modular exponents\nA Cracking the system: factoring large integers\nWe note briefly that the modular exponent xd Hmod nL can in general be accomplished in\nOIlog d log2 nM time by writing the binary representation of d and summing appropriate terms\nfrom the successive squares of x modulo n. With d satisfying (3), this bound can be simplified\nto OIlog3 nM. The other two problems are discussed in the sections below, where we illustrate a\nprogression to the current state of the art.\n\nThomas Coffee\nHard Problems with Simple Holes\nDiscovering Unpublished Primes\nThe simplest primality test for large integers n is exhaustive: divide n by all integers § n,\nrequiring time OHlog n log n !L . Noting that each factor d ¥ e!n !! has a corresponding factor\nn e d § e!n !! , we can confine ourselves to the latter subset of candidate divisors, providing a\nslight improvement. With more memory, exhaustive division can be somewhat improved using\nEratosthenes' prime sieve, accumulating successive primes as the candidates for subsequent\ndivision, reducing the complexity to OHn log log nL . In fact, checking against a known list of\nsmall primes proves efficient for general integer factorization. However, these methods are\nentirely inadequate for integers with large prime factors, being superexponential in the number\nof digits of n .\nWe can take advantage of some special properties of primes to construct simple negative tests\nfor primality, which can be turned into probabilistic positive tests. To begin with, Fermat's\nLittle Theorem implies that n > 1 is composite whenever an-1 T 1 Hmod nL for an integer a\nprime to n. We can also easily show that if n satisfies this condition for at least one such integer\na, it will satisfy this condition for at least half the possible values of a, which suggests a probabi\nlistic algorithm based on random values of a .7 On the other hand, there exist composite n that\nsatisfy an-1 a 1 Hmod nL for all such a, known as Carmichael numbers or pseudoprimes. In\n1994, Alford et al. showed that there are infinitely many psuedoprimes,8 so we cannot hope to\nrule them out with a checklist. Pomerance has previously established bounds on the density of\npseudoprimes,9 but as it turns out we can avoid the issue completely with a stronger test.\nIn 1980, Miller and Rabin constructed a stronger probabilistic primality test10 making use of the\nfollowing related theorem, which we will not prove here: if n is an odd prime and n - 1 a 2s t\nwith\nt\nodd,\nthen\nfor\neach\nb œ Zn ,\nwe\nhave\neither\nbt a 1 Hmod nL\nor\n$ r, 0 § r < s : b2r t a -1 Hmod nL . In this case, it can be shown that at most 1 e 4 of possible\nvalues of b will satisfy this condition if n is odd and composite. Hence, trying k randomly\nchosen values of b will give us a probabilistic bound of 1 i4k on the primality of n . This test\ncan be carried out in OIk log3 nM time. More interesting still, the unproven Generalized Riemann\nHypothesis (GRH) guarantees the converse of the test for some value of b less than 2 log2 n .\nHence postulating the GRH provides a deterministic algorithm with complexity OIlog5 nM.\nProbabilistic algorithms can pose a problem for authentication, since they leave the cryptosys\ntem vulnerable to deliberate selection of weak parameters, which can be used post hoc to repudi\nate the security of the private key. Fortunately, while awaiting proof of the GRH in 2002,\nAgrawal et al. constructed a surprisingly simple fast deterministic algorithm for primality\ntesting.11 The key criterion is a generalization of Fermat's Theorem to polynomials, and holds\nconversely: n is prime if and only if Hx - aLn a Hxn - aL Hmod nL for a prime to n . In order to\nmake the algorithm feasible, this congruence is reduced modulo the polynomial Hxr - 1L for a\nsuitably chosen r. The details become complicated, but the result can ultimately be obtained in\nOIlog12+e nM time, recently improved to OIlog6+e nM by Lenstra and Pomerance.12 This is nearly\nas fast as the conditional strong pseudoprime test of Miller and Rabin.\n\nThomas Coffee\nHard Problems with Simple Holes\nFactoring Large Integers\nThe naive methods we mentioned earlier for primality testing are equally applicable to integer\nfactorization, but again they are wildly suboptimal. Our logical journey toward today' s best\nfactoring algorithms begins again with Fermat, who proposed a technique uniquely suitable for\ncracking RSA cryptosystems. Fermat observed that whenever n a p y q and p o q, n will be\nequal\nto\na\ndifference\nof\nsquares\nwith\none\nsmall\nterm,\nthat\nis,\nn a IAAAAAAAA\np+qAA M\n2 - IAAAAAAAA\np-qAA M a r2 - s2 a Hr + sL Hr - sL where s is small. Moreover, we can find this\nfactorization quickly by computing r2 - n beginning from r = ae!n !!q and stepping upwards until\nwe find a perfect square. The method is fairly limited by the assumption p o q, but can be\ngeneralized.\nInstead of requiring r2 - s2 a n, we can relax the constraint to r2 - s2 a 0 Hmod nL where\nr T s Hmod nL . Whereas the former produces immediate factors Hr + sL and Hr - sL , the latter can\nbe used to quickly obtain nontrivial factors gcdHr + s, nL and gcdHr - s, nL via the Euclidean\nalgorithm. We now seek a method of generating solutions to the congruence equation. This can\nbe done by manipulating the \"parity\" of prime factors: define a factor base B to be a set of\na j\ndistinct elements pi œ Primes › 8-1< , and define a B-number to be any number ‹ p j formed\nn\nn\nby a product of elements of B. For convenience, let x mod n denote the residue of x œ I- AA2AA, AAAA E.\nNow suppose we have a set of B-numbers ai = bi\n2 mod n a ‹ p j ai j that are residues of squares,\nand suppose the total of all powers of each pi occurring in the ai is even, that is,\n¤i ai j a 0 Hmod 2L for each j. Then clearly ‹i ai is a square, which is congruent modulo n to\nthe square of ‹i bi mod n. Of course, we may be unlucky and find that the roots of these\nsquares are congruent modulo n, in which case we must find another set ai .\nThe efficiency of this approach relies on a few different procedures. To generate values bi that\nproduce likely B-numbers, we can let B consist of small primes and choose the bi to produce ai\nof small magnitude. The latter can be done efficiently using a continued fraction method devel\noped by Legendre and deployed by Morrison and Brillhart.13 To guarantee efficiency, we also\nneed a bound on the density of integers divisible by primes below a certain threshold, which can\nbe developed from Stirling' s approximation and the Prime Number Theorem. Ultimately, the\ncomplexity of this approach can be estimated by OIexpAC e!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nlog n log log n E M for a constant\nC .14 Until recently, the best known factoring algorithm was an improvement of this approach\nby Pomerance called the \"quadratic sieve\" that reduced C from (roughly) e!2!! to 1 + e . Finally,\nin 1993 Lenstra and Lenstra generalized the strategy further to develop the \"number field\nsieve,\" with a running time of OIexpAC Hlog nL1e3 Hlog log nL2e3E M, which currently holds the lead\nin integer factorization.\nAs we can see, the best known factoring algorithms, while subexponential, have not yet\nachieved polynomial running time in the digits of n, unlike the algorithms required for generat\ning and operating the RSA cryptosystem. We now compare the other major family of tech\nniques for public-key cryptography.\n\nThomas Coffee\nHard Problems with Simple Holes\nDiscrete Logarithms\nDiffie and Hellman proposed a distinct, though similar, approach aimed at secret key exchange.\nHere we describe the ElGamel cryptosystem, a simple extension of their approach. The algo\nrithm is based on the supposed difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem, and runs as follows:\n(1) Find an integer q that is a prime or a power of a prime.\n(2) Find a generator g of the finite field Fq .\n(3) Let aHqL return a random nonzero element of Fq and fix b = aHqL.\n(4) Define f : Fq o F2 by f HxL = Iga , x y gaybM with a = aHqL, then f -1Hc, xL a x icb .\nq\nThe soundness of the algorithm is fairly obvious. The condition in (1) implies that Fq is a finite\nfield, which must have a multiplicative generator g , though this is not strictly necessary.15 Bob\ncomputes x y gayb i gayb a x.\nThe public key is determined by q, g, and gb , the private key by b . Hence the security of the\nalgorithm rests on the difficulty of determining b from g and gb alone. Alice need only know\ngb to compute gayb for her randomly chosen a, but Eddy requires b in order to compute gayb\nfrom ga . We will again look at the driving algorithms for each major task:\nA Generating the system: discovering primes or prime powers; finding generators of Fq\nA Operating the system: computing modular exponents\nA Cracking the system: finding discrete logarithms\nWe note that the problems of discovering primes and computing modular exponents have\nalready been addressed. Rubin and Silverberg propose an efficient method for finding large\nprime powers (if desired), making use of primality testing, on which we will not elaborate.16\nWang has demonstrated a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for finding generators of Fq\nprovided the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH) is true;17 otherwise, fast probabilistic algo\nrithms exist for finding generators.18 We will focus here on the discrete logarithm problem.\nComputing Discrete Logarithms\nAn algorithm by Silver, Pohlig, and Hellman breaks down the discrete logarithm problem\nsubstantially when the prime factors of q - 1 are small.19 However, these cases are easily\navoided, so we will not pursue this result further. Instead we will turn to the index calculus\nalgorithm for discrete logs, which bears some strong parallels to the factor base approach to\ninteger factorization.20 We assume that q a pn for a prime p, and a is a multiplicative genera\ntor of Fq . For a given y œ Fq , we wish to find x Hmod q - 1L such that y a gx .\nConsider the polynomial ring on Fp , and note that Fq is isomorphic to Fp@X De f HX L for any\npolynomial f of degree n. Since g œ Fq , it can be written as a polynomial gHX L œ Fp@X D of\ndegree § n - 1. Since gHq-1LeH p-1L is a generator of Fp , solving the discrete logarithm problem\nwith this base in Fp will solve our original problem; we will approach this by constructing a\ntable of these discrete logs.\n\nThomas Coffee\nHard Problems with Simple Holes\nAnalogous to the factor base algorithm, we select a \" basis\" of polynomials B O Fq . Again, there\nis a subtle balancing act involved in sizing this set appropriately, which we will not explore\nfully. To compute the discrete logs of all aHX L œ B, we use the following procedure: choose a\nrandom integer t satisfying 1 § t < q - 1 , and let cHX L = gHX Lt mod f HX L. Now we determine\nwhether cHX L is in the span of B , that is, whether cHX L a c0 ‹aœB aHX Lac,a . If so, we can take\ndiscrete logarithms of both sides to obtain loggHX L cHX L - loggHX L c0 a ¤aœB ac,a loggHX L aHX L. We\nknow loggHX L cHX L a t , and we assume we know the discrete logs of constants. Thus we have a\nlinear equation in Zq-1 with unknowns loggHX L aHX L for aHX L œ B. Trying different values of t ,\nwe assemble enough independent equations of this form to solve mod q - 1, allowing us to\ncompute the discrete logs of the elements of B, and hence any discrete log of interest.\nNow we carry out a similar search to find t satisfying 1 § t < q - 1 such that\ny1HX L = yHX L gHX Lt Hmod f HX LL is of the form y0 ‹aœB aHX Laa . When this happens, we can\ncompute\nloggHX L y1HX L a loggHX L y0 + ¤aœB aa loggHX L aHX L,\nand\nsubsequently\nloggHX L yHX L a loggHX L y1HX L - t , which is the discrete log we were looking for. The complexity\nof this algorithm (in q) is comparable to that of integer factorization, hence both approaches\nremain of considerable interest for cryptographic applications.\nElliptic Curve Cryptosystems\nWe assume the reader is somewhat familiar with the algebra of elliptic curves.21 Elliptic curves\nmay be defined over fields of characteristic greater than 3 in the canonical form\nee\nee\nee\n9Hx, yL œ Fq μFq y2 a x3 + ax + b= › S, where Fq is the algebraic closure of Fq , a, b œ Fq ,\n4 a3 + 27 b2 ∫0, and S is the point at infinity. Over fields of characteristic 2, there are two\ntypes of curves, one characterized by the canonical equation y2 + c y a x3 + ax + b, c ∫0, and\nthe other by y2 + x y a x3 + ax2 + b. The algebraic formulas that describe the group law on\npoints of elliptic curves in R and Q extend naturally to finite fields.\nThe multiplicative groups formed by elliptic curves on finite fields may be used in place of the\ntraditional groups on Zn or Fq used in the RSA and ElGamal cryptosystems and their variants.\nIt turns out that making this substitution in the RSA approach is inconsequential: Eddy' s best\napproach is still integer factorization. However, in the case of ElGamal, this modification\ndestroys the index calculus attack, leaving Eddy only weaker methods for breaking the system.\nHere is the elliptic curve analog of the ElGamal system:\n(1) Find an integer q that is a prime or a power of a prime.\n(2) Find a generator g œ EHFqL of the point group (or a point of large order).\n(3) Let aHqL return a random nonzero element of Fq and fix b = aHqL.\n(4) Define f : eF e2\nq oeF e4\nq by f HxL = Ha y g, x + a y b y gL with a = aHqL, then\nf -1Hc, xL a x - b y a y g a x - a y b y g .\n\nB OD Y\nThomas Coffee\nElliptic Curve Cryptosystems\nThe group law for points on elliptic curves has replaced integer multiplication; all operations\nare otherwise identical. Moreover, the computing power required to generate and operate the\nsystem is comparable to the traditional approach.\nIt is worth noting a few known attacks to which elliptic curve cryptosystems are vulnerable.\nSuch systems are still vulnerable to the general Pollard r -method, a \" Monte Carlo\" approach\nusing an iterated self-mapping on a multiplicative group,22 but this approach is superexponen\ntial in the bit length of q. More specific to elliptic curves, Semaev and others found an isomor\nphism between EHFpL and the additive group Fp whenever °EHFpL- a p, providing a polynomial-\ntime algorithm for this class of curves.23 In a similar vein, Menezes et al. found a way to embed\nEHFpL in the multiplicative group on Fqk for some integer k whenever n qk - 1 , providing a\nsubexponential-time algorithm. Both these classes can be avoided by appropriate application of\nHasse' s Theorem, and in the vast majority of cases by choosing a curve at random.\nThus far no analogs to the index calculus algorithm have been developed for elliptic curve\ncryptosystems. Given the rapid evolution of the field and many recent surprises, it is far from\nclear that this situation will persist. However, it is arguable that elliptic curves offer a much\nwider selection of groups and thus may be far more successful at evading general attacks.\nTo get an idea of the advantages of elliptic curve systems given modern hardware and algo\nrithms, we can report that as of 2000, RSA systems with keys of 1024 bits were roughly\nmatched with elliptic curve systems with keys of 160 bits.24 Comparisons with RSA will tend\nto shift due to the different drivers behind these two systems; with respect to discrete logarithm\nsystems, elliptic curve systems can be expected to maintain a consistent lead, barring any theoret\nical breakthroughs. Specialized embedded hardware optimizations of elliptic curve cryptogra\nphy can provide some advantages even beyond those calculated from key size reduction.\nThe computational edge provided by algorithms like elliptic curve cryptography can have unex\npected impact. For example, secure authentication and communication software is now being\nwidely deployed in micro-scale devices, wherein power consumption for computing becomes\nan enormous cost driver. As a result, we may expect the interest and energy devoted to the\ntheoretical problems of number theory to grow for some time to come.\nNotes\n1 In fact, current computing power has pushed parameter sizes for widely used public-key systems high\nenough that we examine only asymptotic complexity in this paper. For smaller values of parameters,\nmultipliers missing from Big-O estimates can have significant practical impact.\n2 The terms \" public key\" and \" private key\" sometimes refer to other, smaller pieces of information from\nwhich the mappings f and f -1 can be easily computed. In this usage, both the public key and the private\nkey may be involved in computing f -1 .\n3 As a result, public-key methods tend to require more resources on the part of Alice and Bob than do secret-\nkey methods. Where performance is an issue, public-key methods are often used purely for exchanging\n\nThomas Coffee\nIntroduction\nsecret keys, which are then used for encryption and decryption of messages. This is known as a digital\nenvelope, and is conveniently extensible to multi-party communications.\n4 We neglect an important class of public-key cryptosystems based on the so-called \" knapsack problem\"\nthat are not widely used. The original versions developed by Merkle and Hellman were broken in 1984\n(Shamir) and 1985 (Brickell). Chor and Rivest introduced revised versions in 1984 and 1988. These were\ncracked for some parameter classes in 1995 (Shnorr and Horner), but their approach still appears viable.\n5 Recall Fermat' s Little Theorem: ap-1 a 1 Hmod pL for p prime and p I a . This follows from the fact that\nmultiplication\nby\na\nis\na\npermutation\nof\nZp\nfor\np I a ,\nhence\nap-1H p - 1L ! a ‹a yZp a ‹Zp a H p - 1L ! Hmod pL , which gives the theorem since p I H p - 1L !. Since\nk y fHnL is a multiple of H p - 1L and Hq - 1L , taking exponents gives us the desired result. Congruence\nHmod nL follows from gcdH p, qL a 1. Note that if gcdHx, nL a 1, the result follows directly from Euler' s\ngeneralization of the Little Theorem.\n6 An RSA cryptosystem can be cracked without determining the private key if one develops a feasible\nmethod for computing modular roots: that is, finding x given f HxL a xe Hmod nL . It is not known whether\nthis problem is equivalent to integer factorization, but substantially more progress has been made on\nfactoring.\n7 To show this, note that if n satisfies an-1 a 1 Hmod nL for a = a1, a2 , it must do so for a = a1 a2 -1 . Sup\npose we have b œ Zn that does not satisfy the relation. Then for any ai that does, we know that b y ai does\nnot, otherwise the relation would hold for b yai yai -1 a b . This accounts for at least half the possible\nvalues of a .\n8 See Alford WR, Granville A, Pomerance C. 1994. There are infinitely many Carmichael numbers.

      "content": "Elliptic Curves in Public Key Cryptography:\nThe Diffie Hellman Key Exchange Protocol and its relationship to the Elliptic Curve\nDiscrete Logarithm Problem\nPublic Key Cryptography\nPublic key cryptography is a modern form of cryptography that allows different\nparties to exchange information securely over an insecure network, without having first\nto agree upon some secret key. The main use of public key cryptography is to provide\ninformation security in computer science, for example to transfer securely email, credit\ncard details or other secret information between sender and recipient via the internet.\nThere are three steps involved in transferring information securely from person A\nto person B over an insecure network. These are encryption of the original information,\ncalled the plaintext, transfer of the encrypted message, or ciphertext, and decryption of\nthe ciphertext back into plaintext. Since the transfer of the ciphertext is over an insecure\nnetwork, any spy has access to the ciphertext and thus potentially has access to the\noriginal information, provided he is able to decipher the message. Thus, a successful\ncryptosystem must be able encrypt the original message in such a way that only the\nintended receiver can decipher the ciphertext. The goal of public key cryptography is to\nmake the problem of deciphering the encrypted message too difficult to do in a\nreasonable time (by say brute-force) unless certain key facts are known. Ideally, only the\nintended sender and receiver of a message should know these certain key facts.\nAny certain piece of information that is essential in order to decrypt a message is\nknown as a key. A key(s) specifies the particular function that transforms the original\nmessage into ciphertext and vice versa. Public key cryptography relies on two keys, a\n\nprivate key and a public key. The public key is published in a place where anyone has\naccess to it. However, each individual person or computer also chooses a private key that\nshould be known only to that individual. The importance of the key to the encryption\nalgorithm should be so great, that if the key is lost, it should be computationally\ninfeasible to recover the original message from the encrypted data.\nIn 1976, Diffie and Hellman proposed the use of certain one-way functions called\ntrap-door functions, to make it almost impossible to decipher encrypted data without a\nkey. The idea is that for each key k, we can choose an encryption function fk:M → C such\nthat it is almost impossible to compute fk\n-1 without knowing k, in polynomial time. Here,\nM is the set of messages and C is the set of ciphertext. Before we illustrate how the\ncryptosystem works, we make a few observations about these trap-door functions. Firstly,\nin order to avoid ambiguity in transferring messages, we insist that the encryption\nfunction fk is injective. That is, each message m∈M corresponds to one and only one\nciphertext c∈C. If we choose M=C, then fk is a bijection and this implies that each\nelement of M must have an inverse in M. Therefore, it is natural to choose M to be a\ngroup. Later, we will see that in elliptic curve cryptography, the group M is the group of\nrational points on an elliptic curve. Before we delve into public key cryptography using\nelliptic curves, I will give an example of how public key cryptosystems work in general.\nSuppose person A want to send a message to person B. Person A chooses some\nkey, k, and an encryption function fk as defined above. Person A publishes fk, which is his\npublic key. Therefore, anyone who wishes to send a message to person A must look up\nhis encryption function fk, and encrypt their message using this function. Once the\nmessage is encrypted, it is very difficult to decipher. This is why the trap door or secret\n\nkey is necessary. We call k, the secret key and only with the knowledge of k, can fk\n-1 be\ncomputed easily and hence the message decrypted. Person A is the only one who should\nknow the value of k and thus, person A is the only one who should be able to decrypt the\nmessage.\nThere is one last point about the description of the trap door function fk that I have\nleft quite vague. That is, I have not said what it means for it to be \"almost impossible\" to\nobtain fk\n-1 from fk. In the language of complexity theory, \"almost impossible to compute\nfk\n-1 from fk\" means \"impossible to compute fk\n-1 from fk by a deterministic algorithm in\npolynomial time\". Now, due to the unsolved nature of the P=NP problem, it is not\nknown whether there actually exists a trap door function. However, we do have functions\nthat behave like trap door functions in the time frame within which we are trying to solve\nthe problem i.e. \"reasonable\" time. However, what counts as reasonable time depends on\nthe level of security one desires. For example, for an intelligence agency, \"reasonable\ntime\" will be much longer than that for someone sending an e-card.\nDiffie-Hellman Key Exchange\nThe cryptosystem we aim to achieve is one where the sender and receiver\nexchange pieces of information via an insecure network resulting in both parties sharing a\ncommon secret whereas anyone else who intercepts the transfer of the message, is unable\nto discover the shared secret. This shared secret is what is used as a key in conventional\ncryptosystems. Such a system is a full public key cryptosystem. We illustrate this key\nexchange protocol with an example.\n\nAlice and Bob aim to exchange information using a public key cryptosystem.\n1. They publicly choose a cyclic group G and a generator x of G.\n2. Alice and Bob choose private keys a and b respectively, where a and b are random\nintegers.\n3. Alice computes xa, Bob computes xb and they exchange these values over an\ninsecure network.\n4. On receiving the information from each other, both Alice and Bob compute the\na\nvalue xab using their private keys and the fact that xab = (xa)b = (xb) .\nNow, both Alice and Bob share a secret, namely, the value xab. That is, Alice and Bob\nhave exchanged a key, xab, that can now be used in a conventional cryptosystem to\nencrypt any messages between Alice and Bob.\nIf the message was intercepted, the eavesdropper, in order to decipher the message, has to\nobtain the value xab from x, xa and xb. This problem is called the Diffie-Hellman problem.\nOne way to tackle this problem is to try to compute a from xa. This is known as the\ndiscrete logarithm problem.\nWith the basics of public key cryptography in hand, we are now in a position to\napply elliptic curves to public key cryptography in order to generate public and private\nkeys.\nElliptic Curve Cryptography\nIn 1985, Neal Koblitz and Victor Miller independently suggested the use of\nelliptic curves in public key cryptography. Supporters of elliptic curve cryptography\n\n(ECC) claim that ECC requires much smaller keys than those used in conventional public\nkey cryptosystems, while maintaining an equal level of security. The use of elliptic\ncurves therefore allows faster encryption and decryption.\nWe now recall a few facts about elliptic curves before illustrating the application\nto public key cryptography.\nGiven an elliptic curve E and a field Fq, we consider the rational points E(Fq) of the form\n(x,y) where both x and y belong to Fq. We choose the point at infinity to be σ.\n1. Define the operation \"+\" on the set of rational points of E as follows. If P and Q\nare two rational points on E, then P+Q is given by the following rule:\nDraw the line joining P and Q, take the third point of intersection of this\nline with the curve as R. Draw the line through σ and R, and take the third\npoint of intersection of this line with E. This point is the point P+Q. Note\nthe operation \"+\" is commutative.\nIn particular we have, σ+ σ= σ and P+(-P)= σ.\n2. Define the operation \"*\" as follows * : Z× E(Fq) → E(Fq) and if P is some point\nin E(Fq), then we define n*P as P+P+P+.....+P, n times. Note that for integers j\nand k, j*(k*P) = (j*k)*P = k*(j*P).\n3. The set of rational points on E form an abelian group under the operation \"+\" with\nidentity σ.\n\nDefinition: The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) is to determine the\ninteger k, given rational points P and Q on E, and given that k*P=Q.\nElliptic curve public key cryptography is based on the premise that the elliptic\ncurve discrete logarithm problem is very difficult; in fact, much more so than the discrete\nlogarithm function for a multiplicative group over a finite field. As mentioned before a\ngroup is normally used in public key cryptography as the domain on which we define our\nencryption function. This is because we need every element of our domain to have an\ninverse and vice versa. In elliptic curve cryptography, the group used is the group of\nrational points on a given elliptic curve.\nThis is how elliptic curve public key cryptography works. For Alice and Bob to\ncommunicate securely over an insecure network they can exchange a private key over\nthis network in the following way:\n1.\nA particular rational base point P is published in a public domain for\nuse with a particular elliptic curve E(Fq) also published in a public\ndomain.\n2.\nAlice and Bob choose random integers kA and kB respectively, which\nthey use as private keys.\n3.\nAlice computes kA*P, Bob computes kB*P and they exchange these\nvalues over an insecure network.\n4.\nUsing the information they received from eachother and their private\nkeys, both Alice and Bob compute (kA*kB)*P = kA*(kB*P) =\nkB*(kA*P). This value is then the shared secret that only Alice and Bob\n\npossess. Note that the difficulty of the ECDLP ensures that the private\nkeys kA and kB and the shared secrety (kA*kB)*P are difficult to\ncompute given kA*P and kB*P. Thus, Alice and Bob do not\ncompromise their private keys or their shared secret in the exchange.\nNow that Alice and Bob share this secret that is almost impossible for a third\nparty to discover, they can use this shared secret in a classical cryptosystems to\ncommunicate securely over the network.\nThe Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem\nAs stated before, the ECDLP is the problem of determining the integer k, given a\nrational point P on the elliptic curve E and the value of k*P. Elliptic curve cryptosystems\nrely on the difficulty of solving the ECDLP. If an eavesdropper is able to solve the\nECDLP then the eavesdropper will be able to break the system. Therefore, it is of great\nimportance to understand the methods of tackling the ECDLP. For, we can use the\nsuccess of these methods as a measure of the security of the system.\nMany proponents of the use of elliptic curves in public key cryptography support\ntheir view based on a belief that the ECDLP is much more intractable that the DLP in\nfinite fields. The strongest techniques normally used to solve the problem in finite fields\nare Shank's baby-step giant-step algorithm, Pollard's ρ-method, the Pohlig-Hellman\nmethod and the index calculus method. None of these methods works for the elliptic\ncurve problem. Until 1990, the only discrete log algorithms that worked for elliptic\ncurves were exponential time algorithms. These algorithms are general in that they\n\nworked for any group irrespective of group structure. In addition, they only work if the\ngroup order is divisible by some large prime. Therefore, it seemed like elliptic curves\nprovided excellent security in public key cryptosystems due to the difficulty of solving\nthe ECDLP. In 1993, the problem was reduced by Menezes, Okamoto and Vanstone from\nthe ECDLP to the DLP on F*qk. However, this method only works for so-called\nsupersingular curves such as curves of the form y2 = x3 + ax when the characteristic p of\nFq is ≡ -1(mod 4), and curves of the form y2 = x3 + b when p ≡ -1(mod3); i.e. curves for\nwhich k is small. Their method is known as the MOV method. This method is only useful\nfor a small class of elliptic curves because most elliptic curves are not supersingular. I\nwill discuss here one of the methods for solving the DLP over a finite field, the index\ncalculus method, and show how it breaks down in the case of the ECDLP.\nThe Index Calculus Method\nThe index calculus method provides a probabilistic subexponential algorithm that\nis adapted to the multiplicative group of a finite field. There are several index calculus\nmethods but they all consist of two phases. Let the discrete logarithm l = logαβ.\nDefinition: A non-deterministic algorithm with input size log n, is subexponential if there\nexists constants c>0 and α∈[0,1) such that the expected running time of the algorithm is\nin\n1-α )\n(c+o( ))(log\nn)α\nlog\n(log\nn)\nL[α,c] = O (e\nFor α = 0, a subexponential algorithm becomes polynomial and for α = 1, a\nsubexponential algorithm becomes fully exponential.\n\nPhase 1: Collecting linear equations\nChoose a \"factor base\" Γ = {γ1, γ2, ... γt}of elements of a group G, with order n. In phase\n1, we will try to determine the discrete logarithms of the γi's. To do this, we repeatedly\nchoose random integers s∈ {0, 1, ....n-1}and compute αs. We then try to factor αs in Γ .\nIf we do find an equation of the form\nt\ni\nαs = ∏γ ν\ni\ni= 1\nthen, we have the linear equation in Zn\nt\ns = ∑ν log α γ i .\ni\ni = 1\nSufficiently many of these equations will allow us to solve for the logα γi's.\nPhase 2: Calculating individual logarithms.\nWe select random integers s and try to factor βα-s in Γ . If we succeed, we have the\nequation\nt\ni\nβα-s = ∏γ ν\ni\ni= 1\nand so\nt\nlogαβ = s + ∑ν log α γ i\ni\ni = 1\nwhere all the numbers on the right hand side are known.\nThis procedure allows one to calculate the discrete logarithm l as described above.\nWe note that the procedure entails balancing the time allotted to each phase. A large\n\nfactor group slows down phase 1 but speed up phase 2. Therefore, depending on how\nmany discrete logarithms, in the same field, need to be calculated, we can choose an\nappropriate size for the factor base.\nIn order to apply this procedure to finding discrete logarithms, we need to be able\nto choose a factor base, which can efficiently construct the equations above. Suitable\nfactor bases are known for finite fields and for class groups of imaginary quadratic\nnumber fields. The index calculus algorithms with the best-proven running times are\nthose due to Pomerance for Fp and F2m, which run in L [\n,\n2 ].\nElliptic Curve Logarithms\nWhile the index calculus method solves the DLP for certain fields, it does not\nwork on the ECDLP. In fact, the main advantage of using a cryptosystem based on\nelliptic curves is that no subexponential algorithms are known, except for some rare\nclasses of curves. Miller argued and Silverman and Suzuki confirmed that an elliptic\ncurve analogue of the index calculus method is unlikely to exist.\nFor an elliptic curve S defined over the finite prime field Fp, the coefficients can\nbe lifted to integers. Consider a possible lifting to EQ. If we restrict our curve to EZ(p),\nwhere Z(p) = {a/b ∈ Q : p does not divide b} is the localised ring of Z at p, then the\ncoordinates of a point on EZ(p) can be reduced modulo p to obtain a point on the curve\nEFp. We would then apply the index calculus method in the following way. Fix a factor\nbase containing some points of EFp which are lifted to points on EZ(p) . Choose several\nrandom elements of EFp as described above and factor them lifting to point on EZ(p) and\n\nexpressing them as a linear combination of the lifted factor base. The result is that the\nreduced points satisfy the same linear relation on EFp.\nThe problem with this procedure is that no simple method is known for lifting\npoints on EFp to points on EZ(p) . Moreover, in order to make the algorithm efficient, we\nneed a factor base made up of only points of small height, where the logarithmic height\nof a point ⎛⎜⎝ d\nx , d\ny\n⎞⎟⎠ with x, y, d integers and gcd(x,y,d) = 1, is given by log max{|x|, |y|,\n|d|}. But the logarithmic heights of multiples nP of some point P say, grow quadratically\nin n. However, by the Mordell-Weil theorem, the maximum number of linearly\nindependent points on a curve EQ, is finite, and is quite small in general. Thus, we\nconclude that there are probably not enough points of small height to construct a\nsufficiently large factor base. Thus, in general, the ECDLP appears to be unsolvable in\npolynomial time using the index calculus method. This is good news for public key\ncryptography based on elliptic curves, as we see that it is very difficult for an\neavesdropper to obtain the shared secret between Alice and Bob if he intercepts the\nmessage being transferred. That is, due to the difficulty of the ECDLP, Diffie-Hellman\nkey exchange is secure for public key cryptography based on elliptic curves.\nReferences\nEnge, A.

      "content": "Dilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\nHasse's Theorem and Rational Points on the General Conic\nDiophantine Equations are equations to which only integer solutions or\nalternatively rational solutions are considered. The study of these equations has\nfascinated man for thousands of years. The ancient Babylonians enumerated Pythagorean\ntriples, integer solutions to the equation:\nX2 + y2 = Z 2\nThe study of Diophantine equations continued through Greece and the Renaissance with\nDiophantos, Fermat, Gauss and many others, and up to the present day in which Wiles'\nvery recent proof of Fermat's last theorem still astonishes mathematicians.\nThe 'natural' first case in which the problem of finding solutions to Diophantine\nequations becomes nontrivial is the conic. Curves are classified by their genus, a certain\nvery useful topological invariant. The Diophantine theory of curves of genus zero is\nnontrivial but complete. The Diophantine theory of curves of genus greater than zero\nincluding elliptic curves is highly nontrivial and incomplete. However, many general\ntheorems exist and the theory is in constant development. In this paper we will detail the\ntheory for conics.\nWe define a point in the plane to be rational if its coordinates are rational. We\ndefine a curve to be rational if it is given by an equation with rational coefficients. In this\npaper we are concerned with finding rational points on rational curves.\nThe first case that one might wish to consider is that of the linear equation. Linear\nequations pose no problems, especially if rational points are all that is desired, in which\ncase the set of rational points on a rational line (a line with rational coefficients) is\nobviously in bijective correspondence with the rationals themselves by projection. In the\n\nDilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\ncase of a conic C with a known rational point, say p, the picture is almost as simple. One\nsimply notes that for any other rational point on C, the line passing through it and p is a\nrational line. Similarly any rational line passing through p must intersect C in a second\n(not necessarily distinct) rational point in the projective plane, since solving for this\nintersection point amounts to solving a quadratic equation with one known rational root.\nIn this paper we assume a basic notion of the ideas of projective geometry. For\nbackground see the appendix of Silverman and Tate. Thus, we may parameterize all of\nthe rational points on C by taking our rational parameter to be the slope of the line\npassing through p. This rational parameterization gives an 'almost' (with the exception of\nfinitely many points) bijective correspondence between the rational points on the curve\nand the rational points on the x-axis. We say that a curve whose rational points satisfy\nsuch a correspondence is birationally equivalent to the line. But the question of the\nexistence of a rational point on a conic still remains. It turns out that over Q, a curve of\ngenus zero is birationally equivalent to either a line or a conic. So, in fact, the\ncharacterization of the rational points on curves of genus zero is reduced to determining\nwhether a given conic has a rational point.\nTo see that not all conics have rational points, consider the curve\nC:\nx2 + y2 = 3.\nConverting to homogenous coordinates we have X2 + y2 = 3Z2. Again see the appendix\nof Silverman and Tate if this process is not familiar to you. For any integer triple\n(X, Y, Z) satisfying this homogenous equation, we can assume gcd(X, Y, Z) = 1. If 31X\nthen we see that 3 Y, so that finally 3IZ.This is a contradiction. It follows that\n\nDilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\nX2 _ y2 - 1 (mod 3). But this implies the left hand side of the homogenous equation is\ncongruent to 2 (mod 3) while the right hand side is congruent to 0 (mod 3). It follows\nthere are no rational points on C.\nIn order to understand the formulation of Hasse's theorem, the theorem that\ndominates the theory of curves of genus zero, we will first need to develop some of the\nbasic properties of p-adic numbers. Recall that the usual absolute value is a valuation on\nQ. A valuation on a general field F is a function I.1:F -- R with the following properties:\n(i)\nIxl> O for all x E F -\n{OF}, and IOFI=\n(ii)\nIxyl= Ixllyl, V x,y e F\n(iii)\nIx + Yl < Ixl + Y, V x,y E F.\nNow in F, (_1)2 - 1, because ((-1)-I + 1)(1) = 1 + (-) = 0, so (-1)-' = -1. Now we have\nthat 1112= 111,So 11 = 1, and 1-112= 11-= 1, so -l = 1 by property (ii) and more generally\nI-rl\nIrl\nr E F.\nThere are other valuations on Q other than the standard absolute value. We claim\nthat the function I.1p,defined by Irlp= p'P for r # 0, where r has the unique expression\nr = pPu/v, with p, u, v E Z, and p4'u, p'v, and 10lp= 0 is a valuation. It is easily seen that\nthis definition satisfies (i) and (ii). To prove it satisfies (iii), let rlIp= p-Pand Islp= p-a, say\nr = pPu/v and s = p'm/n, and without loss of generality a > p. Then\nr + s = pP(un + mvp ° - P)/vn\n(1)\nso that Ir + sp < p-P. It is clear that in general we have V r, s E Q,\nlr + sip< max{lrp, Islp}\n(2)\n\nDilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\nIf slp< Irlpor rip< slpthen we actually have\nIr + sip= maxIrip,\nIslp}\n(3)\nsince the numerator of (l)-assuming\nwithout loss of generality Islp< Irlp--cannot be\ndivisible by p. A valuation satisfying this ultrametric inequality (2), which is clearly\nstronger than the triangle inequality (iii) is said to be nonarchimedian. This valuation\nmay seem to be very counterintuitive at first, but will soon prove to be tremendously\nuseful. Just remember that a reduced rational number is p-adically small if its numerator\nis divisible by a high power of p and p-adically large if it's denominator is divisible by a\nhigh power of p.\nOne of the many constructions of R from Q involves essentially extending Q by\ndefining the reals to be equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences where the classes are\ndefined by convergent. Recall that a Cauchy sequence is a sequence {an} with the\nproperty that for every\n> 0 there exists N > 0 such that n > m > N implies lam- anl <\n,\nand a field is complete if every such sequence converges. Notice that the definition of\nCauchy sequence depends on the chosen valuation. This construction can be applied in\nmuch the same way for each p to our valuation I.Ipto construct a p-adic field Qp that is a\ncompletion of the field Q that is quite distinct from the usual completion R. Formally a\nfield K with valuation 11.11\nis a completion of a field F with valuation I.1if there exists a\nfield monomorphism\n,: F--\nK\nwith the property that llkall= lal V a EF, and the properties:\n(i)\nK is complete with respect to 11.11\n\nDilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\n(ii)\nK is the closure of X(F)in the topology on K generated by the metric\nd(x, y) = Ilx - Yll.\nWe will assume that Qp satisfies the above properties. It can be shown that the\ncompletion of a field always exists and is unique up to isomorphism. For more details on\nthe construction of Qp from Q see pp. 11-12 in Cassel's book. From now on we identify\nQ with a subfield of Qp. Now that we have seen how the construction of Qp goes, let us\nderive some of its fundamental properties.\nWe would hope that many of the properties of Qp would follow through from the\nvaluation .pon Q, just as is the case for R and Q with respect to the usual absolute\nvalue. This is in fact the case, and we will denote the valuation on Qp by I.lpas suggestive\nnotation and in light of the fact that completions preserve valuation on the subfield.\nNotice that by definition of closure of a topological space, for any a and b e Qp, we can\nfind for any > 0, r and s Q such that la - rlp< and lb - slp< . So we can see that\ninequalities (2) and (3) must hold over Qp by relating these statements about elements of\nQp to statements about sufficiently close rationals, for which we have seen (2) and (3) do\nhold. Note that the argument requires both the triangle inequality, as well as the fact that\nQ is dense in Qp. We leave the details of the epsilon argument as an exercise to the\nreader. Given a e Qp with a # 0, we can take r Q such that r - alp < lalp.It follows that\nIrlp= lalpby (2) and the contrapositive of (3). Therefore, the values that .lptakes on Qp are\nthe same as those it takes on Q. We define the ring ofp-adic integers Zp to be\n{a\nQp I lalp< 1}. We leave it to the reader to prove the ring properties. We term the set\nof elements of Qp with valuation 1the p-adic units.\n\nDilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\nWe now go back to the problem of deciding whether a conic has a rational point.\nWe express the equation of the conic in homogenous coordinates. The equation takes the\nform:\nC:\nF(X) =\nfijXiXj = 0\nwhere X = (X 1, X2, X3), and in the sum, 1 < i, j < 3. Also define fji = fij for 1 < i <j < 3. In\nother words, if i =~j, fij is one half the coefficient of XiXj in the expanded form of F.\nFurthermore assume without loss of generality that the conic is nonsingular, or that\ndet(f) i 0 where f is the 3x3 matrix with fij = fij as defined above. We are free to do this\nbecause the singular point of a rational conic must be rational point, so the question of the\nexistence of a rational point is settled in this case. We leave it to the reader to show the\nequivalence of the singularity of f as a matrix and the existence of a point of singularity\nof C. The following theorem completely characterizing the existence of a rational point\non a conic is due to Hasse, and is the goal of the remainder of the paper.\nHasse's Theorem: A conic C defined over Q has a rational point if and only if it has a\npoint over R and over Qp for every prime p.\nNotice that necessity is trivial by the inclusion of Q in R and Qp. To show sufficiency we\nbegin by performing a linear change of variables to diagonalize the matrix f. Our linear\ntransformation T is of the form\nTY=X\nwhere Tij E Q and det(T)\n0. Then Y is a rational point on C1 if and only if TY = X is a\nrational point on C, where\nCl:\nG(Y) =\nfij (TY)i (TY)j.\n\nDilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\nSo if Hasse's theorem holds for C, then it holds for C. We can express our quadratic\nform as:\nF(X) = XT f X.\nOur linear change of variables transforms our form into:\nG(Y) = YT'(TT. f T) Y.\nThe theory of bilinear forms says that there is a basis with respect to which the form F is\northogonal (see for example Artin). In other words we can transform F into the form\nF(X) = fX 12 + f2X22 + f3X32, with firational and nonzero with an appropriately chosen\nlinear change of variable. We may now clear denominators so that fl, f2, f3 E Z. Now we\ncan divide through by any common prime factors so that gcd(fl, f2, f3) = 1. Finally if p\ndivides exactly two of the f, we can replace the variable corresponding to the other\ncoefficient, say Xj, by pXj and then divide through by p. In this way we can reduce F to\nthe form above where Hfi is square free.\nSuppose as in the hypothesis of Hasse's theorem that for each prime p there is a\n3-vector a = (a,, a2, a3) over Qp such that F(a) = 0. Since we know that the valuation I.lp\nassumes the same values over Qp as over Q we multiply a by a sufficient power of p so\nthat max lailp= 1. We consider three cases, and derive conclusions in each that shall soon\nbe put to use in proving Hasse's theorem.\nCase 1:\np - 2, p ff 2f3. Assume without loss of generality that p I f, so that P4f2\nand pf 3. Then we have that Iflal21p< 1. Suppose that la2lp< 1. Then we have that\nIfial2 lp = [f2a22+ f3a 321p< 1, so that f3a321p< 1 by (2) and (3) and la3lp < 1. But then we\nhave that Iflal2 p= 1f2a22+ f3a32Ip< p-2, so that lallp< 1, contrary to the condition that\nmax lailp= 1. It follows that la2lp = la3lp= 1. Now we have that\n\nDilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\nIf2a22 + f3a32Ip = If2 + f3(a3/a2 )2 p < 1, where a3/a2lp = 1. By definition of closure, there\nexists s E Q such that If2 + f3s2lp<\nwith Islp= 1. It is easy to prove using the fact that Fp\nis a field that for each such s, there is a unique integer n\n{O(0,1,\np-l } such that\nIs- nip< 1. Take n to be this integer. Then\nIf2 + f3n2Ip If\n2 + f3S2Ip+ I f3n2 - f3s2 p < 1/p + 1/p2 < 1. So there is some\nn\n{O, 1,...,\np-l} such that f2 + f3 n2\nO (mod p).\nCase 2:\np = 2, 2ff\n2 f3. Suppose without loss of generality that a3 is a unit. It\nfollows that at least one of al and a2 is a unit since 1 = f3a3212 = lflal2 + f2a22 12, so one of\nf2a12 and f3a22 must have valuation 1by (2). Suppose both are units. For all rational units\nr and s in Q2 we have that Ifir +f2s12 < 1, by looking at the parity of the numerator and\ndenominator. It follows that the same result must hold for all units in Q2 by a simple\nepsilon argument. Therefore 1 = f3a32 12 = Ifial2 + f2a22 12 < 1, a contradiction. It follows\nthat precisely two of the ai are units, and so without loss of generality a2 and a3 are, and\nlallp< 1/2,so that If2a22 + f3a32 p < /4. By the same logic as in case 1 we have that\nf2 + f3n2\n0 (mod 4) for some n\n{O, l }. Since f2 and f3 are odd, we have\nf2 + f3 -\n(mod 4).\nCase 3:\np = 2, 21 ff 2f3. Without loss of generality 21fl. If a2 is not a unit, then we\nhave that If3a32 12 = fal 2 + f2a22 12 < /2, SOa3 is not a unit. But then,\nIfial212 = If2a22 + f3a32 12 < /4, so a is not a unit, contradictory to normalization. Therefore,\nwithout loss of generality a2 and a3 are units. If al is not a unit, then we have that\nIfial212= If2a22 + f3a32 12 < /, so by the same logic as in cases 1 and 2, we have\nf 2 + f3 - O (mod 8).\n\nDilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\nIf al is a unit, then for some rational units r, s, and t we have fir2 + f2s2 + f3t2 12 < 1/8 by\napplying the definition of closure and using a simple epsilon argument. By clearing\ndenominators and using the fact that a2 - 1 (mod 8) for all integers a, we see that\nft + f2 + f3\nO0(mod 8).\nWe now state without proof a theorem of Minkowski that is useful in proving\nmany number theoretic theorems such as the four squares theorem, and whose proof can\ntherefore be found in a number of elementary texts. See for instance Jones and Jones pp.\n211.\nTheorem: Let A be a subgroup of index m in the additive group Zn. Let C be a\nsymmetric convex set of volume\nV(C) > 2nm.\nThen C and A have a nonzero point in common.\nWe begin by defining a subgroup A of Z3 by imposing various congruence\nconditions according to the conditions derived supposing the hypotheses of Hasse's\ntheorem. Let x = (xl, x2, x 3)\nCase 1:\np\n2, p I flf2f3. Recall without loss of generality plfl. We saw there exists\nan integer n such that f2 + f3n2\n0 (mod p). Impose the condition x3 - nx2 (mod p). We\nthen have F(x) = fix 1\n2 + f2x2\n2 + f3X3\n0 (mod p).\nCase 2:\np = 2, 2tff 2f3 . Recall without loss of generality f2 + f3 -\n(mod 4).\nImpose the conditions xl - 0 (mod 2), x2\nx-3(mod 2). This imples F(x)\n0 (mod 4).\nCase 3:\np = 2, 21ff 2f3 . Recall without loss of generality 21f, and either\n\nDilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\nf2 + f3 --0 (mod 8) or f + f2 + f3\n0 (mod 8). So s2fi + f2 + f3\n0 (mod 8), where s is\neither 0 or 1. Impose the conditions x2 = x 3 (mod 4) and xl - sx2 (mod 2). These imply\nF(x) - 0 (mod 8).\nThe subgroup A obtained by imposing all of these congruence conditions is of index\n41flf2f31 in Z3 . This is because the each of the congruences in case 1 is with respect to\ndifferent primes and gives a subgroup of index p in Z3 , so by the Chinese Remainder\nTheorem, the simultaneous imposition of these conditions gives a subgroup of index pi\nin Z3, where the pi range over all primes not equal to 2 dividing ff 2f3. In the case that\n24'ff2f3 the conditions in case 2 clearly give an index 4 subgroup of Z3 , and so by the\nChinese remainder theorem the simultaneous imposition of all the conditions in cases 1\nand 2 give a subgroup of index 41flf2f31 in Z3 . In the case that 21flf2f3, the conditions in\ncase 3 clearly give an index 8 subgroup of Z3 , and so by the Chinese remainder theorem\nthe simultaneous imposition of all the conditions in cases\nand 3 give a subgroup of\nindex 41flf2f31 in\n3. For all x E A we have that F(x)\n0-(mod 41flf2f31).\nWe now apply Minkowski's theorem to A and the set\nC:\n2 + [f2x\n2 + f2x22 + f31x32 < 41ff2f31.\nWe see that C is clearly symmetric, and convex because it is an ellipsoid. Using the\nvolume formula for the ellipsoid we have V(C) = 32zg/3i(fif2) (f1f3) (f2f3) >23 14fif2f 31.\nApplying Minkowski's theorem, we see that there exists a nonzero point y in A n C. We\nhave F(y) - 0 (mod 41fif 2f31) and IF(y)l\nIfilyl2 +\nf21Y22+ f31Y3\n2 < 41fif2f 31, so that F(y) = 0\nas desired. This proves the existence of a projective point on our conic C given the\nhypotheses of Hasse's theorem, and concludes the proof of Hasse's theorem.\n\nDilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\nNotice that in addition to proving the existence of such a point, we have provided\nfor any conic C with a rational point an ellipsoid in which a corresponding homogenous\npoint can be found. So one can determine whether a given conic has a rational point in\nfinite time. Also, we have not used the hypotheses of Hasse's theorem for p42ff 2f3. The\nreader may check that there always exist p-adic points on C for such primes and so we\ngain no additional information by considering them. Finally, we have not used the\nhypothesis of the existence of a point on C over R. In fact, this is implied by the\nexistence of points over Qp for every p. P-adic extensions are widely used in the theory of\nrational points on curves of genus 1 and greater. The reader will thus find the present\npaper to not only conclude the case of genus 0, but also to introduce valuable techniques\nfor further study of Diophantine equations.\n\nDilip Das\n18.704\nRogalski\nReferences\n1.\nCassels, J.W.S., Lectures on Elliptic Curves.

      "content": "Waring's problem, taxicab numbers, and other sums of powers\n\n8 Dec 2004\n1. Introduction. Many of the most perplexing problems in number theory arise from\nthe interplay of addition and multiplication. One important class of such problems\nis those in which we ask which numbers can be expressed as sums of some numbers\nwhich are defined multiplicatively. Such classes of numbers include nth powers (in this\npaper, for any fixed n; in a more general treatment, n could also be variable). This\ngives rise to the Pythagorean theorem known by every schoolchild as well as the much\nmore perplexing problem of Fermat, the so-called \"Hardy-Ramanujan\" or \"taxicab\"\nnumbers, the four-square theorem of Lagrange, Waring's problem, and various other\nfamous number-theoretic problems. If we attempts to express numbers as sums of\nprimes, we get the (still unproven) conjecture of Goldbach.\nIn this paper, I will begin by considering the most ancient of such problems, that\nof expressing a square as a sum of two squares. I give some results on which numbers\ncan be expressed as a sum of two squares in various numbers of ways, using some\nelementary results from the theory of quadratic forms. And I will show which numbers\ncan be expressed as sums of three squares (most, due to Gauss) and four squares (all,\ndue to Lagrange). I will then examine the problem that made the number 1729 famous -\nwhich numbers are sums of two cubes in two different ways? I will present a probabilistic\napproach to predicting the number of solutions to this problem. I will give bounds on\nthe number of ways of writing a number as a sum of two cubes, both based on its size\nand on its factorization. And I will present parametrizations that gives infinite families\nof solutions.\nFinally, I will address what is usually known as \"Waring's problem\" - how many\nnth powers are needed to write any number as a sum of such powers? We will see\nthe basic results for small powers of positive integers, including the variation of this\nproblem known as the \"easier\" Waring problem in which sums and differences of powers\nare taken.\n2. Pythagoras and Fermat. The Pythagorean theorem was known to Euclid ([4,\nProp I.47]), but he seems to have treated it as a purely geometric proposition. And\nvarious sources repot that the ancient Egyptians knew about the existence of the 3-4-5\nright triangle. What they may now have known is that there are infinitely many such\ntriples, or that there is a simple parametrization of the same.\nLet a Pythagorean triple be an ordered triple of positive integers (x, y, z) such that\nx2 + y2 = z2 . Then the simple algebraic identity\n(r - s 2)2 + (2rs)2 = (r 2 + s 2)2\n(2-1)\n\n8 December 2004\ngives an infinity of Pythagorean triples (r2 -s2 , 2rs, r2 + s2) where r and s are positive\nintegers. What is perhaps more surprising is that all Pythagorean triples can be ex\npressed in this form - and therefore the problem of generating a list of these is trivial.\nThe following discussion is adapted from [7].\nWe note that the equation in question is homogeneous of degree 2, so if (x, y, z) is a\nPythagorean triple, so is (kx, ky, kz) for any positive integer k. We define a primitive\nPythagorean triple or PPT to be one such that gcd(x, y, z) = 1, and consider the problem\nof finding all primitive triples. The solution is as follows:\nTheorem 1. (x, y, z) is a PPT with y even if and only if (x, y, z) = (r2 -s2 , 2rs, r2 +\ns2) for some positve relatively prime integers r, s of opposite parity.\nProof: We note that in a primitive triple, x, y cannot both be even, for then z would\nbe even and the triple would not be primitive. But they cannot both be odd, for then\nx ≡ y\n≡ 1 (mod 4), and so z\n≡ 2 (mod 4), which is impossible. So x and y are of\nopposite parity; since the equation is symmetric in x, y we will assume y is even and x\nis odd (and hence z is odd). Now, we will rewrite the equation as (z -x)(z + x) = y ,\nand we note that all the exponents in the prime factorization of y2 are even. We note\nthat z -x, z + x are both even, and rewrite to get\nz + x z -x\n3 y 2\n=\n(2-2)\nand since (x, z) = 1, the two factors on the left are relatively prime. And it is well-known\nthat two relatively prime integers whose product is a square must be squares. So we\nget (z + x)/2 = r2 , (z -x)/2 = s2, y/2 = rs for some positive integers r, s; furthermore,\n(r, s) = 1 and r > s. And r -s2 = x is odd, so r, s are of opposite parity. 2\nThis gives an example of a parametric solution to a Diophantine equation; we will\nsee others. We also see which squares can be represented as sums of two squares; we\nwll later take up the question of which integers can be expressed in like manner.\n3. Numbers which are sums of squares. The central result of this section is that\nevery positive integer can be expressed as a sum of four squares of nonnegative integers\nin at least one way.\nWe begin with some probabilistic results. (For further detail see [6].) Let Rk (n)\ndenote the number of k-tuples (x1, · · · , xk ) of nonnegative integers such that P\ni xi ≤ n.\nThus, for example, R2(10) = 13, with the pairs\n(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1).\nThen we claim that R2(n) ≈ πn/4. We observe that pairs (x1, x2) such that 0 ≤ x1, x2\nand x1 + x2 ≤ n correspond to points in that part of the circle of radius √n centered\non the origin which are in the first quadrant, and the number of these is very near\nthe area of that quarter-circle, which is πn/4. Similarly, we predict R3(n) ≈ πn3/2/6\n(one-eighth the volume of a sphere of radius n1/2) and R4(n) ≈ π2n2/2. (Incidentally,\nthe two-dimensional version of this problem is often known as the \"circle problem\",\nand it is possible to get an error term, but this seems irrelevant here.) The increasing\nexponents on n in these functions is a heuristic indication that there exists an integer\nk such that all positive integers are sums of k squares.\nThis probabilistic method predicts that the average number of representations of an\ninteger near n as a sum of two squares is π/4; of three squares π√n/4; of four squares\n\n·\nμ\nY\nμ\n¶\n\n8 December 2004\nπ2n. But this method does not take into account purely number-theoretic considerations\nsuch as modular arithmetic; nor does it take into account that most k-tuples are counted\n\"more than once\" in Rk (n) due to the inherent symmetry of the problem. For sums of\ntwo squares, we actually have the following characterization:\nTheorem 2. ([7, p.55], originally due to Fermat) A positive integer n can be written\nas the sum of two integer squares if and only if all primes congruent to 3 modulo 4 occur\nin its prime factorization with an even exponent.\nProof: (Sketch.) We note that 2 = 12 + 12 . It is known that all primes congruent\nto 1 modulo 4 can be written as a sum of two squares; a proof can be found in any\nstandard number theory text. And for primes q, q ≡ 3 (mod 4), q2 = q2 + 02 is a sum\nof two squares. Furthermore, we have the identity\n(a 2 + b2)(c 2 + d2) = (ac + bd)2 + (ad -bc)2\n(3-1)\nso if m and n are sums of two squares, then mn is as well. This proves that our condition\nis sufficient. The proof of necessity is omitted.\nA natural question to ask is: what is the probability that a randomly chosen integer\ncan be written as a sum of two squares? The result, as found in [5, p.22], is due to\nLandau: let N2(x) be the number of integers less than x which are sums of two squares.\n(Note that N2(x) is not the same as R2(x), and in fact N2(x) < R2(x) for all x ≥ 25.)\nThen\n¶\nx\nc1\nc2\ncn\nN2(x) = b\n1 +\n+\n+\n+\n+ O\n√log x\nlog x\nlog2 x\nlogn\nlogn+1 x\n· · ·\nx\nfor some real constants b, c1, c2, . . ., and the constant b is\nb =\n⎛\n⎝ 1\n2 q≡3\n(mod 4)\n(1 -q-2)-1\n⎞\n⎠\n-1/2\nwhich has numerical value about 0.764223653 . . . and is known as the Landau-Ramanujan\nconstant [13]. If we approximate N2(x) as bx/√log x, then the probability of a number\nnear x being a sum of two squares can be obtained by differentiation, giving\n(log x)-1/2\n0(x) ≈ B 1 -\nN\n2 log x\nso for large x the probability approaches zero, albeit rather slowly; N2\n0(10100) ≈ 0.05,\nso one in every twenty numbers around 10100 is a sum of two squares.\nThe analogous classification of numbers that can be expressed as sums of three\nsquares is due to Gauss:\nTheorem 3. ([7, p. 170]; originally due to Gauss) An integer n can be written as\nthe sum of three squares if and only if it is not of the form 4m(8k + 7).\nProof: First, we note that all squares are congruent to 0, 1, or 4 modulo 8. Thus,\nby adding the possible combinations of three of these, we see that no three of these give\na sum of 7, so an integer congruent to 7 modulo 8 cannot be written as a sum of three\nsquares. Incidentally, there is no identity like (3-1) or (3-2) for sums of three squares,\n\n8 December 2004\nand in fact it is possible to find two numbers which can be written as a sum of three\nsquares whose product cannot. For example, 3 = 12 + 12 + 12 , 21 = 42 + 22 + 12 , but\n63 ≡ 7 (mod 8).\nNow, if x2 + y2 + z2 = n and 4 n, then considering x , y , z2 (mod 4), we see that\n|\nx , y , z\n≡ 0 (mod 4), so x, y, z are even. Thus, if n is a sum of three squares n =\nx2 + y2 + z2 , then\nn\n3 x 2\n+\n3 y 2\n+\n3 z 2\n=\ngives n/4 as a sum of three squares. We can conclude that if n = 4m(8k + 7) then it is\nnot a sum of three squares.\n(The proof of the converse is omitted.)\nFor large n, w note that 1/8 of all integers are of form 8k + 7; 1/(8 · 4) are of form\n4(8k + 7); 1/(8 · 42) are of form 42(8k + 7), and so on; each of these is mutually exclusive.\nSo the probability that a randomly chosen integer cannot be expressed as a sum of three\nsquares is\nμ 1\n¶\n1 μ\n¶\n1 4\n+\n+\n+\n=\n1 +\n+\n+\n=\n=\n8 4\n8 42\n· · ·\n· · ·\n8 3\n·\n·\nand this probability does not depend on the magnitude of n.\nWe will now prove Lagrange's four-square theorem, given the following:\nTheorem 4. ([7, p.315]; Minkowski) Let A be a nonsingular real n by n matrix,\nand let Λ be the lattice of integer linear combinations of the columns of A. If C is a set\nin Rn which is convex and symmetric about ~0, and if v(C) > 2n det(A), then there is a\nx ∈ Λ such that ~\nlattice point ~\nx = 0 and ~\nx ∈ C.\nThis result is sometimes known as Minkowski's convex body theorem for general\nlattices.\nTheorem 5. ([7, p.317]; originally due to Lagrange) All positive integers can be\nexpressed as sums of four squares.\nProof: First, we note from the previous discussion that this is the best possible\nbound. And we have a product property as in (3-1) for sums of two squares, because of\nthe identity\n(x + x2 + x3 + x4)(y + y 2 + y + y4 )\n=\n(x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 + x4y4)2 + (x1y2 -x2y1 + x3y4 -x4y3)2\n(3-2)\n+\n(x1y2 -x2y4 -x3y1 + x4y2)2 + (x1y4 + x2y3 -x3y2 -x4y1)2\nso if m and n can be written as sums of four squares, so can mn. So it is enough to\nshow that all primes can be expressed as sums of four squares.\nLet Λ be the lattice of integer linear combinations of (p, 0, 0, 0), (0, p, 0, 0), (r, s, 1, 0), (s, -r, 0, 1),\nwhere r, s are chosen so that r2 + s2 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p). (The existence of such r, s is a\nstandard result in the theory of quadratic forms; see for example [7, Thm. 5.14].) Then\nwe take\n⎡\np 0 r\ns\n⎤\n0 p\ns -r ⎥\nA =\n⎢\n0 ⎦\n⎣\n\n8 December 2004\nand we can write any point ~x in Λ as A~t for some ~t ∈Z4 . Then we have\nx1 + x2 + x3 + x4\n=\n(pt1 + rt3 + st4)2 + (pt2 + st3 -rt4)2 + t + t4\n≡ (1 + r 2 + s 2)(t3 + t4) (mod p)\n≡ 0 (mod p).\nNow, the volume of a single cells in the lattice Λ is given by the determinant of A,\nwhich is p . Let C be the ball of radius √2p centered on the origin; this has volume\n2π2p . So by the previous theorem of Minkowski, there is a point ~\nx = (x1, x2, x3, x4)\nx = ~0 and ~\n. Then 0 < x2 + x2 + x2 + x4 < 2p, and x2 + x2 + x2 + x4 ≡0\nsuch that ~\nx ∈C\n(mod p), so we conclude that x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = p.\nFinally, since\n169 = 132 = 122 + 52 = 122 + 42 + 32 = 102 + 82 + 22 + 12 = 82 + 82 + 62 + 22 + 12\ngives representations of 169 as the sum of one, two, three, four, and five positive squares,\nwe see that we can write any integer n ≥ 169 as a sum of five positive squares. We\nsimply write n -169 as a sum of k positive squares, 0 ≤k ≤4 (this can be done since\nn is a sum of four squares, some of which may be zero), and to this sum append the\nrepresentation of 169 as 5 -k positive squares.\n4. Waring's problem. Edward Waring, in his 1770 book Meditationes Algebraicae,\nasked a question which is usually interpreted as: for any positive integer k, does there\nexist an integer g(k) such that every positive integer can be expressed as a sum of g(k)\nkth powers, where g(k) depends only on k? We define g(k) in this way, and G(k) as\nthe largest number for which infinitely many numbers require G(k) kth powers to be\nadditively represented. Lagrange's four-square theorem gives g(k) = 4; G(k) = 4 also,\nsince there are infinitely many numbers which cannot be expressed as a sum of three\nsquares.\nIt is easy to find a lower bound for g(k) as follows.\nTheorem 6. ([2, p.11]) For positive integer k,\ng(k) ≥[(3/2)k] + 2k -2\nwhere [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x.\nProof: Consider n = 2k[(3/2)k] -1 as a sum of kth powers. Clearly n < 3k , so any\nexpansion of it into kth powers must consist of only copies of 1k and 2k . Maximizing\nthe number of 2k used minimizes the total number of kth powers needed; thus we write\nn = 2k ([(3/2)k ] -1) + 1k(2k -1)\nto minimize the number of kth powers needed; this is\n([(3/2)k ] -1) + (2k -1) = [(3/2)k] + 2k -2\nwhich gives a lower bound for g(k).\n\n8 December 2004\nFor small k, this gives g(1) ≥ 1 (g(1) = 1 trivially), g(2) ≥ 4 (g(2) = 4 by the\nfour-square theorem), g(3) ≥ 9, g(4) ≥ 19; g(5) = 37; and so on. Waring made the\nassertion that g(2) = 4, g(3) = 9, g(4) = 19 with only numerical evidence; as far as is\nknown he did not make conjectures about g(k) for k ≥ 5, although certainly this bound\nwould have been within his reach. Examples of numbers which require g(k) kth powers\nare\n7 = 22 + 3 12 , 23 = 2 23 + 7 13 , 79 = 4 24 + 15 14\n·\n·\n·\n·\n·\n, · · ·\nIt is known that the previous theorem gives g(k) exactly in all but finitely many\ncases.\nTheorem 7. ([2, p.23]; Dickson-Pillai-Rubugunday-Niven) If k ≥ 6 and if the fol\nlowing inequality holds:\n3k -2k + 2 < (2k -1)[(3/2)k ]\n(4-1)\nthen g(k) = [(3/2)k] + 2k -2. However, if\n3k -2k + 2 ≥ (2k -1)[(3/2)k ]\nthen we define N(k) by N(k) = [(3/2)k]\n[(4/3)k ] + [(3/2)k] + [(4/3)k] and the conclu-\n· · ·\nsion is now\ng(k) = [(3/2)k ] + [(4/3)k] + 2k -3\nif 2k < N(k), or\ng(k) = [(3/2)k ] + [(4/3)k] + 2k -2\nif 2k = N(k).\nIt has been verified that (4-1) holds for 6 ≤ k ≤ 200, 000. It is conjectured that it\nholds for all k ≥ 6, and a nonconstructive proof exists that there are most only finitely\nmany values of k for which (4-1) does not hold.\nIt is also of interest to calculate G(k). It is believed that G(3) = 6 - that is, that all\nsufficiently large integers can be written as a sum of at most six cubes - and it is proven\nthat G(3) ≤ 7. It has been proven that only two numbers requires nine cubes [11]:\n23 = 2 23 + 7 13 , 239 = 2 43 + 4 33 + 3 13\n·\n·\n·\n·\n·\nand it is believed that 454 = 73 + 4 33 + 3 13 is the largest of the numbers requiring\n·\n·\neight cubes (fifteen such are known) and 8042 = 163 + 123 + 2 103 + 63 + 2 13 is the\n·\n·\nlargest of those (121 known) requiring seven cubes. Perhaps even G(3) = 5. [14]\nWe can also attempt Waring's problem with mixed signs. We say that n is expressible\nas a sum and difference of m kth powers if there exist x1, x2, ·, xm integers such that n\ncan be written in the form\nk\nk\nk\nn = ±x1 + ±x2 +\n+ ±xm\n· · ·\n. How many kth powers do we need in order to express any number as a sum or\ndifference of kth powers? We call this number w(k). Similarly, we define W(k) as\nthe smallest number such that there are infinitely many integers requiring W(k) kth\npowers to be expressed as a sum and difference. The determination of w(k) and W(k)\nis conventionally called the \"easier\" Waring problem, but it is actually more difficult.\nProposition 8. All positive integers can be expressed as a sum or difference of three\nsquares, that is, w(2) = 3\n\nμ\n\n8 December 2004\nProof: We note that all odd numbers can be expressed as a difference of two squares:\n2x + 1 = (x + 1)2 - x\nand all even numbers can be expressed as a sum and difference of three squares:\n2x = x - (x - 1)2 + 12 .\nSo w(2) ≤ 3. But the number 6 cannot be expressed as a sum or difference of two\nsquares; it is not a sum of two squares, by inspection, and by enumeration of cases\nmodulo 4 we see that no integer congruent to 2 modulo 4 is a difference of two squares.\nSo w(2) = 3.\nProposition 9. All positive integers can be expressed as a sum and difference of at\nmost five cubes, and infinitely many require at least four cubes; that is,\n4 ≤ W (3) ≤ w(3) ≤ 5\nProof: To find w(3), we begin by noting the following identity:\n6x = (x + 1)3 + (x - 1)3 - 2x\n(4-2)\nand from (4-2) we can readily derive the identities\n6x ± 1\n=\n(x + 1)3 + (x - 1)3 - 2x ± 13\n6x ± 2\n= x 3 + (x ± 2)3 - 2(x ± 1)3 23\n6x + 3 = (x - 3)3 + (x - 5)3 - 2(x - 4)3 + 33\nand these give expressions for all integers, broken down according to their residue class\nmodulo 6, as a sum and difference of at most five cubes.\nBut all cubes are congruent to 0, 1 or -1 modulo 9, so numbers of the form 9n ± 4\ncannot be expressed as a sum and difference of less than four cubes. Thus we conclude\nthat\n4 ≤ W (3) ≤ w(3) ≤ 5\nand exact values are not known [1].\nWe can also calculate uppper bounds for w(k) in a manner analogous to that for\nk = 3. We begin with the following identity:\nX\n(-1)k-m\nμk - 1¶\n(x + m)k = k! x + k - 1 ¶\n(4-3)\nm\nm\nwhich gives a representation of k!(x + (k - 1)/2) as a sum and difference of 2k-1 kth\npowers. Proceeding from (4-3), we can find representations of all integers as sums os\nkth powers. For k = 4, for example, this represents 24x + 36 as a sum and difference of\neight fourth powers. Now, we note that the fourth power residues and their negatives\nmodulo 24 are 0, ±1, ±8, ±9; we need to add at most four of these to get a representative\nof any residue class modulo 24. Thus, we have a complete residue system modulo 24\nwhere each element is a sum and difference of at most four fourth powers. Combining\nthis with our representation of all integers congruent to 12 modulo 24 in eight fourth\npowers, we see that w(4) ≤ 12.\n\n8 December 2004\nProposition 10. All positive integers can be expressed as a sum and difference of\nat most eighteen fifth powers; that is, w(5) ≤ 18.\nProof: Using (4-3) for k = 5, we can represent all numbers of form 120x + 240 - or,\nequivalently, of form 120x - as sums and differences of sixteen fifth powers. Now, if n\nis odd, then:\nClaim 11. For all odd integers n, 120 n - n.\n|\nProof: Factor n5 - n = n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n2 + 1). Working modulo 5, we note that\nexactly one of these four factors is divisible by 5 for any n, so 5 n -n for all n. Similarly,\nmodulo 3, exactly one of 3 n, 3 n - 1, 3 n + 1 is true, so 3 n\n|\n5 - n. Finally, since n is\n|\n|\n|\nodd, n - 1, n + 1, n2 + 1 are all even, so 23 n - n. Since 5,\n|\n3, 8 are relatively prime, we\nconclude 120 n5 - n.\n|\n|\nSo all odd integers are fifth power residues modulo 120. Therefore all even integers,\nbeing twice some odd integer, are the sum of two fifth power residues modulo 120. Since\nall multiples of 120 are sums and differences of at most sixteen fifth powers, we conclude\nthat w(5) ≤ 18.\nSimilar arguments may show that w(k) is only slightly larger than 2k-1 for all k;\ncompare g(k) which is slightly larger than 2k . The added flexibility of taking differences\ngreatly decreases the number of terms needed.\nErdos and Suranyi [3] give the following as exercises:\nw(k) ≤ 2k-1 + k!\nwhere one uses the identity (4-3) (Ex. 7.8.10), and\nw(k) ≤ G(k) + 1\n(Ex. 7.8.11). The first of these can be seen by adding ±(1k ) repeatedly to a multiple\nof k. Adding ±(1k) and ±(2k ) reduces this bound to\n» k! 1⁄4\nw(k) ≤ 2k-1 +\n+ (2k - 1)\n2k+1\nbut this is not much of an improvement, since the second term still dominates. I\nconjecture that this method can lead to a bound that is exponential in k, particularly\nsome constant times 2k . However, the best known bound on G(k) is due to Vaughan\n[3, p. 217]\nG(k) < k(3 log k + 4.2)\nso seeking a bound on the order of 2k is immaterial.\n5. The taxicab problem. There is a famous story in the mathematical folklore con\ncerning the preternaturally brilliant1 Indian mathematician Ramanujan. When Ra\nmanujan was at Cambridge working with Hardy, he took ill and had to be admitted\n1Due to certain fortuitous properties of the decimal number system, Ramanujan's recognition of\n1729 is not as impressive as it may seem at first glance. Ramanujan's observation amounts to seeing\nthat 729 + 1000 = 1728 + 1, and neither of these additions is particularly hard. Perhaps noting that\nthis is the least number with this property is more interesting. This is not meant to belittle Ramanujan\n- but his true greatness lie elsewhere.\n\n8 December 2004\nto a hospital. Hardy came to visit him, and remarked that he came in taxicab num\nber 1729, which he found to be a dull number. Ramanujan is said to have responded\nthat this was actually a quite interesting number - it is the smallest number which can\nbe expressed as the sum of two (positive) cubes in two different ways. As a result, the\n\"taxicab numbers\"2 are often defined as those n for which there are solutions in positive\nintegers to the equation\nn = x 3 + y = u 3 + v .\n(5-1)\nfor which {x, y} = {u, v}.\nProbabilistically, we can make a heuristic estimate of the density of the taxicab\nnumbers as follows. The number of lattice points in the first quadrant with x3 + y\nn, x ≤y is for large n proportional to n2/3; call it kn2/3, where\n≤\nπ2\nk = 1 Z 1\n(1 -x 3)1/3 =\n= .4416596881...\n9Γ(2/3)3\nand differentiating this, the expected number of lattice points with n -1/2 ≤x3 + y <\nn+1/2 (and thus x3 +y3 = n) is about 2 kn-1/3. The probability that two lattice points\nare in this strip can be given by standard techniques in probability, using the Poisson\ndistribution; this gives a rough lower bound for the density of the taxicab numbers,\nrought because it fails to include any number-theoretic information that would make\n\"collisions\" more likely. See [6] for further information.\nThere are various methods of finding solutions to (5-1). The first ([9, Sec. 5.2]) is by\nfactoring x3 + y3 = n to give\n(x + y)(X2 -xy + y 2) = B\nand then trying all possible integer factorizations n = AB, where\nx + y = A, x 2 -xy + y = B\nfrom which we get\n3A ±\n√\n12B -3A2\nx =\nand so for each A we can check if this gives an integer x. For n = 1729, (A, B) = (13, 133)\nand (19, 91) give the two integer solutions to x3 + y3 = n and thus a solution to 5-1.\nThis is of course rather impractical if one wishes to generate a large number of\nsolutions. One method to find solutions is to generate all sums of cubes up to a certain\nnumber and see which are equal; this is the method of Lugo and Larsen [6]. Another is\nthe \"chord-and-tangent\" method commonly used in Diophantine analysis. If we have\nx1 + y 3 = u1 + v1\nand\nx2 + y 3 = u2 + v\n2Some\nauthors\nsay\nthat\nthe\nnth\ntaxicab\nnumjber\nis\nthe\nsmallest\nnumber\nwhich\ncan\nbe\nrepresented\nin\nn\nways\nas\na\nsum\nof\ntwo\ncubes;\nthis\nseqence\nbegins\n(2, 1729, 87539319, 6963472309248, 48988659276962496, · · · ) ([10, A011541]; the sixth term is un\nknown) and is much sparser than the sequence of taxicab numbers under our definition.\n\n8 December 2004\nthen we note that x3 + y3 = u3 + v3 is a curve of degree three in four dimensions, and\nthus it has three intersections with any line. In particular, it has three intersections\nwith the line through (x1, y1, u1, v1) and (x2, y2, u2, v2). We can parametrize this line\nas\n(x, y, u, v) = (x1 + (x2 - x1)t, y1 + (y2 - y1)t, u1 + (u2 - u1)t, v1 + (v2 - v1)t)\nand substituting these into (5-1) gives a cubic in t with integer coefficients. The sum\nof its roots must be rational, and we know two rational roots t = 0, t = 1, so the third\nroot is rational. This gives a third intersection of the line and the curve with rational\ncoefficients; since the taxicab equation is homogeneous, clearing the denominators gives\na solution in integers.\nHowever, this solution does not always give a taxicab number; for example, the first\ntwo taxicab numbers are\n1729 = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103 , 4104 = 23 + 163 = 93 + 153\nbut the cubic\n(1 + t)3 + (12 + 4t)3 = 93 + (10 + 5t)3\nhas roots t = 0, 1, -77/20, and subtituting t = -77/20 and clearing denominators gives\n(-57)3 + (-68)3 = 1803 + (-185)3\nwhich is not a solution to (5-1) in positive integers. (However, we can rearrange it to\nget 1853 = 573 + 683 + 1803; thus this problem is, not surprisingly, essentially the same\nproblem as expressing a cube as a sum of three cubes.) However, noting that\n20683 = 103 + 273 = 193 + 243\nin conjunction with the above expression for 4104, we get the cubic\n(2 + 8t)3 + (16 + 11t)3 = (9 + 10t)3 + (15 + 9t)3\nwhich has roots 0, 1, 13/38; substituting t = 13/38 and clearing denominators gives\n429396751 = 1803 + 7513 = 4723 + 6873 .\nHowever, this method tends to generate very large solutions, relying as it does on the\nclearing of denominators in rational solutions, and there are other methods.\nRamanujan gave two general solutions to (5-1) (see [15]). The first is\n(α + λ2γ)3 + (λβ + γ)3 = (λα + γ)3 + (β + λ2γ)3\nwhere\nα2 + αβ + β2 = 3λγ2 .\n(5-2)\nIn general this still suffers from the problem of clearing denominators - we can pick\nα, β, γ integers and there is no guarantee that λ = (α2 + αβ + β2)/3γ2 is an integer.\nAlternatively, we can look for integer solutions to (5-2), but this may be quite difficult.\nRamanujan's other solution, which does not have these defects, is\n(A2 + 7AB - 9B2)3 + (2A2 - 4AB + 12B2)3 = (2A2 + 10B2)3 + (A2 - 9AB - B2)3 .\n\n8 December 2004\n.\nBounds can be placed on the number of solutions to x3 + y3 = m based on the prime\nfactorization of m, and on the absolute value of x, y (which can be negative) based on\nm. By observing that any solution satisfies\nx + y = A, x 2 -xy + y = B\nwhere AB = m, we have\nm ≥ B = x 2 -xy + y 2 = 3 x 2 +\nμ 1\n¶2\n3 x 2\n|\n|\n2 x -y\n≥ 4\nso x ≤ 2\np\nm/3, and similarly for y. [9, p. 149] Also, x3 + y3 = m has no more than\n| |\nτ (m) solutions in pairs of integers (x, y), where τ (m) is the number of positive divisors\nof m. Here (u, v) and (v, u) are counted as distinct solutions if u = v, so in fact we have\nτ (m)/2 distinct solutions in the previous sense, unless m is twice a cube in which case\nour bound is (τ (m) + 1)/2. [9, p. 177]\n6. Further questions and methods. The machinery of generating functions can be\nbrought to bear on this problem. Following the example of Hardy and Littlewood [12,\np. 3], we can let A = (am) be a strictly increasing sequence of nonnegative integers, and\nconsider the generating function\ninf\nam\nF (z) =\nX\nz\nm=1\nwhich is convergent in z < 1 since it is a subsequence of the geometric series. We then\nhave\n| |\ninf\ninf\ninf\nn\nF (z)s =\nX\nX\nz am1 +···+ams =\nX\nRs(n)z\n· · ·\nm1 =1\nms =1\nn=0\nwhere Rs(n) is the number of representations of n as the sum of s members of A. Various\npapers of Hardy, Ramanujan, Littlewood, and Vinogradov develop this method using\nintricate tools from complex analysis. For a trivial example, we can ask in how many\nways a number can be written as a sum of, say, two odd numbers. If A = (1, 3, 5, · · · )\nthen we have F (z) = z/(1 -z2). We note that\n= 1 + z + z 2 +\n1 -z\n· · ·\nand differentiating as a formal power series,\n2 +\n(1 -z)2\n· · ·\n= 1 + 2z + 3z\nand multiplying by z,\nz\n= z + 2z 2 + 3z 3 +\n(1 -z)2\n· · ·\nand substituting z2 for z gives\nF (z)2 =\nz\n= z 2 + 2z 4 + 3z 6 +\n(1 -z2)2\n· · ·\n\n8 December 2004\nand so we see that an odd number cannot be written as a sum of two odd numbers,\nwhile an even number can be expressed as a sum of two odd numbers in k ways. Of\ncourse, there are more direct ways to prove this - but the so-called Hardy-Littlewood\nmethod often works when there is no other way.\nAlthough Waring's problem is essentially solved, the so-called \"easier\" Waring prob\nlem - that allowing sums and difference of powers, finding w(k) or W (k) - is still open,\nas is the \"infinite\" Waring problem of finding G(k). The only known values of G(k)\nare G(2) = 4 and G(4) = 16. Various other generalizations of Waring's problem have\nbeen suggested - instead of taking sums of kth powers, one could take sums of values of\nsome polynomial F (m) with integer values evaluated at some integer m. For example,\nif F (m) = m(m + 1)/2 we reproduce Fermat's conjecture that any number is a sum of\nthree triangular numbers. Fermat also conjectured that all integers are sums of r r\ngonal numbers (three triangular numbers, four squares, and son on); this is an example\nof a general trend in this area. The denser a sequence of integers, in general, the less\nsuch integers we need to express all integers as sums of members of the sequence. If we\ntake the set of primes we get Goldbach's conjecture. And we can take a rather strange\ngeneralization due to Scourfield [8]: say 2 ≤ n0 ≤ n1 ≤ n2 ≤ · · · is a nondecreasing\nsequence of integers. Then it is true that for each j we can find r(j) such that every\nsufficiently large number can be written in the form\nn0\nx\n+ x n1 +\n+ x nr\nj\nj+1\nj+r\n· · ·\nif and only if P\ni 1/ni diverges!\nReferences\n[1] Izzet Coskun.

The official due date is Wednesday Dec. 8,\nsince this is our last day of classs. You should think of this as a firm deadline,\nto help pace yourself, and because you don't want it hanging over your head\nduring finals week. If necessary there can be a little flexibility there though.\nYou should aim to pick a topic soon, either from this list or not, and discuss\nit with me by next week. If you pick your own, it should at least fall into the\ngeneral areas of number theory or algebraic geometry. Set up an appointment or\njust stop by. By far the longest part of writing this paper should be reading the\nsources you will use and gaining a general understanding of them, and figuring\nout what you want to include. That part should not be left until the last\nminute. The writing part is not meant to take you nearly as long. I'm generally\nsuggesting topics that I don't know all of the details about myself. Your job is\nto teach me something about the topic, assuming I know about as much basic\nbackground material as you do.\nThe things I hope you gain from this experience are (1) learning something\nnew you hopefully find interesting, and (2) practice summarizing the main ideas\nof some topic in mathematics. Some of the topics below are a bit more advanced\nthan the material in our book, and you shouldn't necessarily feel that you have\nto understand every detail of what you read; in any case you won't have enough\nspace to give all of the details in your paper, and needn't expect to give proofs\nof everything you state.\nIf you know LaTeX, I'd love if you use it to write your paper. If you don't,\nthis might be a great opportunity for you to learn it; you really only have to\nwrite one paper using it to get a basic knowledge, and then you'll have it at your\ndisposal for the future. But I'm also perfectly happy with neatly hand-written\npapers.\nThe books mentioned below I have in my office for you to peruse or make\nphotocopies or borrow for the evening whenever you want (mostly they're library\ncopies; I took them out myself rather than put them on reserve.)\nPossible Topics\nThese topics are probably too big and general; if you see something you like,\ncome chat with me about it and we'll see how best to cut it down to the right\nsize. If you have no idea what to pick or don't like any of these at all, come see\nme so we can discuss options.\n(1) Rational points on Conics over Q. The text shows how to find all rational\npoints on a conic in Section I.1, provided you know that the conic has a rational\npoint. To decide if a rational conic has a rational point, there is a theorem of\nLegendre, or a more general version by Hasse. Describe some of the results in\nthis area with some proofs. Possibility 1: describe Legendre's fairly elementary\n\nsolution to this problem, maybe also mentioning Hensel's Lemma. See [NZM],\nSection 5.5. Possibility 2: describe the more general version due to Hasse. This\nrequires you to learn some preliminaries on p-adic numbers, and you won't have\nspace to present all of the details of the proof. See [Cas], Chapters 1-5.\n(2) Integer points on Conics over Q. For some special kinds of conics, the\ninteger points can be found exactly. For example, you might study the solution\nto Pell's equation (you should do this topic only if you haven't already seen\nthis material), summarizing first some basic properties of continued fractions.\nA basic reference is [NZM], Chapter 7.\n(3) Proof of a special case of Fermat's last theorem. (For people with an\nabstract algebra background but who have not taken algebraic number theory.)\nLearn a bit about algebraic number theory, enough to understand units and\nunique factorization in number fields. Summarize the main ideas and use them\nto prove Fermat's last theorem for the case of a regular exponent p, i.e. there\nare no integer points on the curve x p + y p = z p unless one of x, y, z is 0, where\np is a so called regular prime.

Investigate some elements of this sub\nject beyond what is in Section IV.4 of our book (which describes how elliptic\ncurves are useful to help factor large integers.) Possibilities are: how elliptic\ncurves are used for primality testing, or how elliptic curves are used to actu\nally create codes, possibly including the discrete logarithm problem for elliptic\ncurves. References include [Wash] Chapters 5,6, [BNRV] part III, or [Ko1]\nChapter 6.\n(5) Fermat's last theorem, a more historical approach. Discuss a bit of the\nhistory of Fermat's last theorem, what methods were used to attack it in the\npast, together with a necessarily very superficial discussion of the method used\nin Andrew Wiles' eventual proof from the 90's. You might consider merging the\nmaterial discussed in one of the \"math books for nonmathematicians\" which\ndescribe Fermat's last theorem, (for example [Azcel], though there are many\nothers), with a wee bit culled from an advanced summary of Wiles' proof, for\nexample the one in [CSS] Chapter 1 (a lot of this will seem impossible to un\nderstand, but try to tease out the main ideas.)\n(6) The congruent number problem.

      "content": "A FEW ELEMENTARY FACTS ABOUT ELLIPTIC CURVES\n1. Introduction\nIn our paper we shall present a number of facts regarding the doubly pe-\nriodic meromorphic functions, also known as elliptic functions. We shall\nfocus on the elliptic functions of order two and, in particular, on the Weier-\nstass P-function. The doubly periodic meromorphic functions can be looked\nat as meromorphic functions defined on complex tori. This is because, as a\ntopological space, a complex torus is the quotient of the complex plane over\nan integer lattice.\n2. Periodic functions\nDefinition 1. A meromorphic function f is said to be periodic if and only\nif there exists a nonzero ω ∈C such that f(z + ω) = f(z), for all z ∈C.\nThe complex number ω is called period.\nAs a first observation, we may say that if ω is a period, then any integer\nmultiple nω is also a period. Also, if there exist two periods ω1 and ω2,\nthen n1ω1 + n2ω2 is also a period, for all n1, n2 ∈Z. Given a meromorphic\nfunction f, define M to be the set of all its periods (including 0). From the\nabove observations, we deduce that M is a Z-module.\nIf f is a non-constant meromorphic function, the module M containing\nall its periods cannot have a accumulation point, since otherwise f would\nbe a constant. Therefore each point in M is isolated. In order words, M is\na discrete module.\nWe have the following theorem regarding the module M:\nTheorem 1. If M is the module of periods of a meromorphic function f,\nit must have one of the following forms:\n- M = {0}.\n- M = {nω|n ∈Z}, for some nonzero complex value ω.\n- M = {n1ω1 + n2ω2|n1, n2 ∈Z}, for some nonnzero complex values\nω1, ω2 ∈C, whose ratio is not real.\nProof. Let us suppose that M has nonzero elements. Then take a nonzero\nelement ω1 of smallest absolute value. This is always possible, since in any\ndisk or radius ≤r, there are only finitely many elements of M.\nDefine\nA = {nω1|n ∈Z}. We have A ⊂M. If M = A, choose ω2 the smallest\nelement (in terms of absolute value) in M -A. First, note that ω1/ω2 cannot\nbe real, otherwise, choose an integer m such that m ≤ω1/ω2 < m + 1. It\nfollows that |ω1 -mω2| < |ω1| which contradicts the minimality of ω1.\n\nFinally, let us prove that M = {n1ω1 +n2ω2|n1, n2 ∈Z}. We remark that\nsince ω1/ω2 is not real, any complex number can be written uniquely in the\nform tω1+sω2, where s and t are real numbers. In order to see this clearly, it\nis enough to look at ω1 and ω2 as vectors in the two-dimensional real vector\nspace. Since ω1 and ω2 are independent as vectors, it becomes obvious why\nany complex number can be written uniquely as a linear combination of ω1\nand ω2 with real coefficients. Now, take an arbitrary element x of M and\nwrite it in the form sω1 + tω2, where s and t are real numbers. Choose\nintegers n1 and n2 such that |s -n1| < 1/2 and |t -n2| < 1/2. It follows\neasily that |x-n1ω1-n2ω2| < 1/2|ω1|+1/2|ω2| ≤|ω2| (the first inequality is\nstrict, since ω1/ω2 is nonreal). Because of the way ω2 was chosen, it follows\nthat x = nω1 or x = n1ω1+n2ω2. Hence, M = {n1ω1+n2ω2|n1, n2 ∈Z}.\n□\n3. Elliptic Functions and Unimodular Forms\nDefinition 2. We shall call a meromorphic function f elliptic iffits module\nof periods M is a linear linear combination of two periods ω1 and ω2, such\nthat ω1/ω2 is nonreal (i.e. the third case of the previous theorem).\nThe pair (ω1, ω2) mentioned above is a basis for the module M. In this\nsection we shall discuss about the possible bases of a module of periods M.\nSuppose (ω′\n1, ω′\n2) is another basis of M. Then\nω′\n1 = m1ω1 + n1ω2,\nω′\n2 = m2ω1 + n2ω2\nand\nω1 = m′\n1ω1 + n′\n1ω2,\nω2 = m′\n2ω1 + n′\n2ω2\nUsing matrices, we can write\n\nω′\nω′1\nω′\nω′2\n\n=\n\nm1\nn1\nm2\nn2\n\nω1\nω1\nω2\nω2\n\nω1\nω1\nω2\nω2\n\n=\n\nm′\nn′\nm′\nn′\n\nω′\nω′1\nω′\nω′2\n\nConsequently, we have\n\nω1\nω1\nω2\nω2\n\n=\n\nm′\nn′\nm′\nn′\n\nm1\nn1\nm2\nn2\n\nω1\nω1\nω2\nω2\n\nWe have ω1ω2-ω2ω1 = 0, because otherwise ω1/ω2 is real, which contradicts\nour assumption. It follows that\n\nm′\nn′\nm′\nn′\n\nm1\nn1\nm2\nn2\n\n=\n\nand, since all the entries are integral,\n\nm′\nn′\nm′\nn′\n=\n\nm1\nn1\nm2\nn2\n= ±1\nTherefore, from (ω1, ω2) one can obtain (ω′\n1, ω′\n2) via a linear transformation\nof determinant 1, which is usually called unimodular transformation. We\nhave thus seen that any two bases of the same module M are related to one\nanother by a unimodular transformation.\nFrom all the possible bases of a module, one can choose a particular one,\nwith certain characteristics which will be called cannonical basis. This fact\nis the object of the following\nTheorem 2. Given a module M, there exists a basis (ω1, ω2) such that the\nratio σ = ω1/ω2 has the following properties:\n- Im σ > 0\n- -1/2 ≤Re σ ≤1/2\n- |σ| ≥1\n- If |σ| = 1, then Re σ ≥0\nAlso, σ defined above is uniquely determined by these conditions, up to a\nchoice of two, four or six corresponding bases.\n4. General Properties of Elliptic Functions\nWe shall use a convenient notation: z1 ≡z2 iffz1 -z2 belongs to M (in\nother words, iffz1 -z2 = n1ω1 +n2ω2, for two integers n1 and n2). Let f be\na elliptic function with (ω1, ω2) as basis of the module of periods. Since f\nis doubly-periodic, it is entirely determined by its values on a parallelogram\nPa whose vertices are a, a + ω1, a + ω2 and a + ω1 + ω2. The complex value\na can be chosen arbitrarily.\nTheorem 3. If the elliptic funtion f has no poles, it is a constant.\nProof. If f has no poles, it is bounded in a parallelogram Pa. Since f is\ndoubly periodic, it is bounded on the whole complex plane. By Liouville's\ntheorem, f must be a constant function.\n□\nAs we have seen before, the set of poles of f has no accumulation point. It\nfollows that in any parallelogram Pa there are finitely many poles. When we\nshall refer to the poles of f, we shall mean the set of mutually incongruent\npoles.\nTheorem 4. The sum of residues of an elliptic function f is zero.\nProof. Choose a ∈C such that the parallelogram Pa does not contain any\npole of f. Consider the boundary ∂Pa of Pa traced in the positive sense.\nThen the integral\n2πi\nZ\n∂Pa\nf(z)\n\nequals the sum of residues of f. But the sum equals 0, since the integrals\nover the opposite sides of the parallelogram cancel each other.\n□\nA simple corollary 1 of this theorem is that an elliptic function cannot\nhave a single simple pole, otherwise, the sum of residues would not equal 0.\nTheorem 5. A nonconstant elliptic function f has the same number of poles\nas it has zeroes. (Every pole or zero is counted according to its multiplicity)\nProof. We may consider the function f ′/f which has simple poles wherever\nf has a pole or a zero. The residue of a pole α of f ′/f equals its multiplicity\nin f if α is a zero of f, and minus its multiplicity in f, if α is a pole of f.\nApplying now theorem 4 to the function f ′/f, we get the desired result.\n□\nSince f(z) -c and f(z) have the same number of poles, we conclude that\nthey must have the same number of zeroes.\nDefinition 3. Given an elliptic function f, the number of mutually incon-\ngruent roots of f(z) = c is called the order of the elliptic function.\nObviously, the order does not depend on the choice of c.\nTheorem 6. Suppose the nonconstant elliptic function f has the zeroes\na1, · · · , an and poles b1, · · · , bn (multiple roots and poles appear multiple\ntimes). Then a1 + · · · + an ≡b1 + · · · + bn (mod M).\nProof. Consider all ai and bi in the parallelogram Pa for some a. We consider\nthe following integral on ∂Pa:\n2πi\nZ\n∂Pa\nzf ′(z)\nf(z) dz\nGiven the properties of the poles and zeroes of f ′/f mentioned above, we\ndeduce that f has a zero (or a pole) at t, of order k ∈Z>0, iffzf ′/f has a\nsimple pole at t with residue nt (or -nt). It follows that the integral equals\na1 + · · · + an -b1 -· · · -bn. Now, we must prove that the integral is in M.\nFor this purpose, we write the integral on the pairs of two opposite sides:\n2πi\nZ a+ω1\na\nzf ′(z)\nf(z) dz -\nZ a+ω1+ω2\na+ω2\nzf ′(z)\nf(z) dz\n\n= -ω2\n2πi\nZ a+ω1\na\nf ′(z)\nf(z) dz\nAlso,\n-ω2\n2πi\nZ a+ω1\na\nf ′(z)\nf(z) dz = -ω2\n2πi\nZ\n∂D\nwdw\nwhere D is the curve given by f(z) when z varies from a to a+ω1.\n2πi\nR\n∂D\nwdw\nis an integer (=the winding number with respect to 0). Taking into account\nboth pairs of opposite sides of Pa, we get the desired result.\n□\n1Latin corona \"garland\" > diminutive corolla > corollarium \"gratuity\" > English\n\n5. The Weierstass P-function\nThe simplest example of an elliptic function is of order 2. As we have\nseen before, there is no elliptic function of order 1. An elliptic function of\ndegree 2 can have either one pole of degree 2 or two distinct simple poles.\nWe shall analyse, following Weierstass, the case of an elliptic function with\na double pole.\nWe may place the pole at the origin and consider the coefficient of z-2\nas being 1 (translations and multiplications by constants do not change\nessential properties of elliptic functions).\nIf we consider f(z)-f(-z) we get\na elliptic function that has no singular part. (The function f(z) -f(-z)\ncould only have a single simple pole at 0, but this is impossible). Hence,\nf(z) -f(-z) is constant and setting z = ω1/2, we get that this constant is\nzero. Therefore, f(z) = f(-z) and we can write\nP(z) = z-2 + a0 + a1z2 + ...\nWe may suppose that a0 = 0, because adding/substracting a constant from\nf is irrelevant. What we get is the so called Weierstass P-function. This\nelliptic function can be written as\nP(z) = z-2 + a1z2 + a2z4 + ...\n(1)\nThe existence of a elliptic function of order 2 has not yet been proven. We\nshall prove that the Weierstrass P-function is uniquely determined for a\nbasis (ω1, ω2), being given by the formula:\nP(z) = 1\nz2 +\nX\nω=0\n\n(z -ω)2 -1\nω2\n\n(2)\nwhere the summation is over all ω = n1ω1 + n2ω2, ω = 0. We shall prove\nfirst that this sum is convergent. For every |ω| > 2|z|, we have\n\n(z -ω)2 -1\nω2\n=\n\nz(2ω -z)\nω2(z -ω)2\n≤10|z|\n|ω|3\nThis is because |2ω -z| < 5/2|ω| and |z -ω| ≥|ω| -|z| ≥|ω|/2.\nWe conclude that in order for the sum (2) to converge, it is enough to\nprove that the sum\nX\nω=0\n|ω|3 < inf\nAlso, since ω1/ω2 is not real |n1ω1 + n2ω2| = |ω2||n1ω1/ω2 + n2| ≥c|n1| for\nsome positive real constant c (for any integers n1, n2). Similarly, we find\na constant d such that |n1ω1 + n2ω2| ≥d|n2|, for any integers n1, n2. In\nconclusion, |n1ω1 + n2ω2| ≥k(|n1| + |n2|), where k = cd/(c + d) ≥0. Since\nthere are exactly 4n ordered pairs (n1, n2) of integers such that |n1|+|n2| =\n\nn, we have\nX\nω=0\n|ω|3 <\n4k3\ninf\nX\nn2 .\nWe also need to prove that P(z) =\nz2 + P\nω=0\n\n(z-ω)2 -1\nω2\n\nhas periods\nω1 and ω2. We denote, for this purpose\nf(z) = 1\nz2 +\nX\nω=0\n\n(z -ω)2 -1\nω2\n\n(3)\nSince the series is absolutely convergent, we may differentiate term by term:\nf ′(z) = -2\nz3 -\nX\nω=0\n(z -ω)3 = -2\nX\nω\n(z -ω)3\nThis series is also absolutely convergent, since if |ω| > 2|z|, we have\nX\nω\n\n(z -ω)3\n≤16\nX\nω\n|ω|3\nand we deduce that (3) converges absolutely. Consequently, f(z +ω1)-f(z)\nand f(z + ω2) -f(z) are constant functions. By definition, f is even and,\ntherefore, setting z = -ω1/2 and z = -ω2/2 we get that the constants are\n0. Therefore, f(z + ω1) = f(z) and f(z + ω2) = f(z), for all z ∈C. Hence,\nwe proved that f is elliptic. If P has the form in (1) and is doubly periodic,\nwith periods ω1 and ω2, it follows that P -f has no singular part, and is\ntherefore constant. Since both P and f have no constant term (i.e. the\ncoefficient of z0 is 0), it follows that P = f. Hence, we deduce that\nP(z) = 1\nz2 +\nX\nω=0\n\n(z -ω)2 -1\nω2\n\nand also that\nP′(z) = -2\nX\nω\n(z -ω)3\n6. The function ζ(z)\nBecause P has no residues, it is the derivative of a function -ζ(z), where\nζ(z) = 1\nz +\nX\nω=0\n\nz -ω + 1\nω + z\nω2\n\nIn order to prove that this series converges, we note that\nz -ω + 1\nω + z\nω2 =\nz2\nω2(z -ω)\n\nHence, if |ω| > 2|z|,\nX\nω=0\n\nz -ω + 1\nω + z\nω2\n=\nX\nz\nω2(z -ω)\n≤|z|2 X\n|ω|3\nand, consequently, the series converges absolutely.\nSince f(z + ωi) = f(z), for i = 1, 2 it follows that ζ(z + ωi) = ζ(z) + ηi,\nfor i = 1, 2, where ηi are complex constants. These complex constants have\na beautiful property which comes from the fact that\n2πi\nZ\n∂Pa\nζ(z)dz = 1\n(4)\nWe prove first (4). If we look at (2), we deduce that\nζ(z) = z-1 -a1\n3 z3 -a2\n5 z5 + · · ·\nNow, if we evaluate the integral on two opposite sides of the parallelogram\nPa, we get\n2πi\nZ a+ω1\na\nζ(z)dz -\nZ a+ω1+ω2\na+ω2\nζ(z)dz\n\n= -η1ω2\n2πi\nIntegrating similarly on the other pair of opposide sides, we get that\n-η2ω1\n2πi\n--η1ω2\n2πi\n= 1\nand, finally,\nη1ω2 -η2ω1 = 2πi\nwhich is called Legendre′s relation.\n7. The Differential equation corresponding to P\nUsing the definition of ζ(z), we have the following identity\nz -ω + 1\nw + z\nω2 = -z2\nω3 -z3\nω4 -· · ·\nConsequently, we can write\nζ(z) = 1\nz +\ninf\nX\nk=2\nGkz2k-1\nwhere by Gk we mean\nGk =\nX\nω=0\nω2k\n(5)\nWe note that ζ(z) has no terms of the form z2n since P is an even function\n(and ζ is odd). Differentiating (5), we get\nP = 1\nz2 +\ninf\nX\nk=2\n(2k -1)Gkz2k-2\n\nWriting only the significant parts of the following functions, we have:\nP(z) = 1\nz2 + 3G2z2 + 5G3z4 + · · ·\nP′(z) = -2\nz3 + 6G2z + 20G3z3 + · · ·\nP′(z)2 = 4\nz6 -24G2\nz2\n-80G3 + · · ·\n4P(z)3 = 4\nz6 + 36G2\nz2\n+ 60G3 + · · ·\n60G2P(z) = 60G2\nz2\n+ 0 + · · ·\nIt follows that\nP′(z)2 -4P(z)3 + 60G2P(z) = -140G3 + · · ·\nThe left side of the last identity is an elliptic function and it does not have\nany singular part. Therefore, it must equal a constant. Setting z = 0, we\nget that the constant is -140G3. Hence\nP′(z)2 -4P(z)3 + 60G2P(z) + 140G3 = 0\nIf we set g2 = 60G2 and g3 = 140G3, we get\nP′(z)2 = 4P(z)3 -g2P(z) -g3\nProvided that e1, e2 and e3 are the complex roots of the polynomial\n4y3 -g2y -g3, we can write\nP′(z)2 = 4(P(z) -e1)(P(z) -e2)(P(z) -e3)\nBecause P is even and periodic, we have P(ω1 -z) = P(z). It follows that\nP′(ω1 -z) = P′(z). Hence P′(ω1/2) = 0. Similarly, P′(ω2/2) = 0. We have\nalso, P′(ω1 + ω2 -z) = P′(z), and therefore, P′((ω1 + ω2)/2) = 0. Since P′\nhas only one pole (of order 3), it must have exactly three roots (counting\nmultiplicity).\nOn the other hand, the complex numbers ω1/2, ω2/2 and\n(ω1 +ω2)/2 are mutually incongruent. Therefore, they are the three distinct\nroots of P′.\nFor every ei there exists di such that P(di) = ei (this equation in fact has a\ndouble solutions, as we shall see below). Also, di are roots of P′. Therefore,\nif we apply P on the set of roots of P′ (a set which has three elements, ω1/2,\nω2/2 and (ω1 + ω2)/2), we get the whole set {e1, e2, e3}. Consequently, we\nmay set P(ω1/2) = e1 and P(ω2/2) = e2 and P((ω1 + ω2)/2) = e3.\nEvery root of P -ei is also a root of P′. If, for instance, e1 = e2, then the\nroot d1 of P -e1 has multiplicity at least 2 in P′ and, therefore, multiplicity\nat least 3 in P -e1, which is impossible for an elliptic curve of order 2. In\n\nconclusion, we derive an important observation, namely that all roots ei are\ndistinct.\nReferences\n[1] L.Ahlfors, Complex Analysis, (1979), 263-278"
