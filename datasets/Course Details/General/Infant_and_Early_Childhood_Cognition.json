This is a communication intensive course on cognitive development. We will treat developmental psychology as \"applied philosophy\"--a way to answer fundamental questions about the origins and nature of knowledge. You should expect to gain an understanding of the questions that motivate developmental research and the methods that can answer these questions.\n\nWe will focus on how children acquire commonsense knowledge about the world, focusing particularly on their understanding of objects (shoes, ships and sealing wax), agents (you, me, and sometimes fuzzy green blobs) and causality (the relations that bind these together). We will examine the evidence for innate representations and also look at the processes that underlie learning and conceptual change.\n\nThe course is structured around primary sources, not a textbook. Most days, you will read one brief review article and one or two empirical articles.\n\nAssignments\n\nThe class\nassignments\n(200 points total) are intended to give you experience with things you will be expected to do if you become a research scientist. Thus you will participate in a lab meeting to design a research method, critically review an empirical article, create an educational brochure for the general public, present a research poster, write a literature review, and develop and write-up an original experimental design.\n\nDaily Mini-lectures\n\n(1 Point Each, 2 Points Poster Session/20 Points Total)\n\nEvery day marked with an* (18 days) you will pick up a red or blue index card at the start of class. I'll start class by telling you which of the day's readings each colored card is responsible for. You'll then be asked to find a partner (a new one each day so you get to know each other) with the other color of card.\n\nYou have 3 minutes to tell your partner:\n\nThe main question(s) at stake\n\nThe main finding(s)\n\nThe main implications\n\nYou will then spend 3 minutes listening to your partner's summary. The TA's and I will randomly choose partners among you as well. After the summary, we will ask you to write your partner's name with a 1 if the partner clearly knew the reading and a 0 if not (Honor system) and that will be your point for the day.\n\nOn the poster session days, there will not be a mini-lecture but the group not presenting will complete a peer evaluation of the posters (2 points).\n\nGroup Practicum\n\n(10 Points Credit/No Credit)\n\nThis is the only group project and will be assigned the second day of class. The meeting should take ~1 hour outside of class. You will propose a method to answer a single developmental question and produce 5 powerpoint slides explaining your design.\n\nOne Public Information Brochure\n\n(20 Points)\n\nThis will be assigned the second day of class. You will be given a question a parent might pose on cognitive development (or if you prefer, choose your own topic). You are expected to research the answer by finding and reading 4-6 empirical papers on the topic.\n\nYou will then synthesize the findings into a public information brochure of 1,000 words or less. A draft of this will be returned to you with comments (but no grade).\n\nThe rough draft is required. If you do not submit it, 10% (2 points) will be deducted from your final grade. The best 3-5 brochures in the class will be sent to the Boston Children's Museum. With their approval, they will be made available to the public there at the end of term.\n\nOne 2-page Critical Response Paper\n\n(20 Points)\n\nYou may choose any of the suggested articles or any other journal article you like for a critical response. Critical response papers are intended to simulate the peer-review process. You will write the type of paper scientists write when deciding whether some new research merits publication. The first paragraph should summarize the question the authors wanted to answer and how the authors addressed the question (e.g., the experimental design). The remainder of the paper (2 pages max) should be devoted to considering the merits of the question the author(s) are addressing, whether the design is a good test of the research question, whether the interpretation of the results is justified, and ways you might improve or expand upon the research. You are allowed, but not required, to revise and resubmit this. If there are substantial improvements, your grade can go up 10% (2 points).\n\nPoster\n\n(20 Points)\n\nAt the end of the second full week of class, you will be assigned an article and a poster session. Poster groups A and B will present on session 15; poster groups C and D will present on the last day of class session 16. This project will be explained in detail in class and sample posters will be available. You are expected to display the background, design, results, and conclusions of your article in the poster. You are also expected to be able to talk about the research and summarize highlights clearly for anyone who stops by and asks. Quality of presentation is critical but you are\nnot\nexpected to print (expensive) professional quality posters.\n\nProposal Description and Topic Seminar\n\n(10 Points Credit/No Credit)\n\nYou will submit a 2-page description of your proposed research project. This will form the basis of your Topic Seminar and will be circulated to all the other students in your seminar group. It should be sufficiently developed that A. you are comfortable presenting it and having it discussed by your peers and B. it forms a useful basis for developing an experiment. It does not need to include any citations. BOTH the 2-page description AND seminar attendance are required for credit.\n\nOriginal Research Proposal\n\n(100 Points)\n\nYou may propose research on any topic in cognitive development that interests you. It must be on cognitive development but it does not have to be a topic specifically covered in the course. This project has four parts:\n\nA 4-5 page literature review of your topic ending with the specific question you'd like to address and an explanation of its connection to the literature. The format should be APA style and comparable to the\nIntroduction\nof the articles you will read in class. A draft of this will be returned to you with comments (but no grade). The rough draft is required. If you do not submit it, 10% (10 points) will be deducted from your final grade.\n\nA 3-4 page description of your proposed experiment. The experiment should specify the population to be tested, the materials and procedure you will use, and the conditions you hope to test. The format should be comparable to the\nProcedures\nsection of the articles you will read in class.\n\nA 3-4 page discussion section. This section should discuss the conclusions you would draw if your hypothesized results were confirmed. It should also anticipate possible objections to your approach and suggest areas for further study. The format and tone should be comparable to the\nDiscussion\nand\nGeneral Discussion\nsection of the articles you will read in class.\n\nA reference section (APA style; not counted in 13-page limit).\n\nAll papers must be submitted both in hard copy and electronically. Please keep this between 11-13 pages (Times, 12-font, double-space, 1\" margins).\n\nGrading\n\nASSIGNMENTS\n\nPOINTS\n\nDaily mini-lectures (1 point each--credit/no credit)\n\nGroup practicum (credit/no credit)\n\nPublic information brochure (10% deducted if no draft)\n\nCritical response paper\n\nPoster session\n\nProposal and meeting (credit/no credit)\n\nFinal paper (10% deducted if no draft)\n\nLetter Grade Assignments\n\n98%-100% A+\n\n88%-89% B+\n\n78%-79% C+\n\n93%-97% A\n\n83%-87% B\n\n73%-77% C\n\n90%-92% A-\n\n80%-82% B-\n\n70%-72% C- etc.\n\nFor group assignments, every member of the group receives the same grade, unless there's a clear discrepancy in the distribution of effort. Please see the peer evaluation page of this syllabus for how to handle the exceptional case of differential grading on group assignments. For all other assignments, you will be graded on the quality of your own work--there is no curve or pre-set grade distribution for this class.\n\nLate assignments will only be accepted with a note from Student Services. Please do not ask me or the TA's about late assignments because there is no further information we can provide--they will always be accepted if you have a note from Student Services; they will never be accepted if you do not.\n\nThe brochures and critical response papers will be graded by the teaching assistants. The posters will be graded by a TA, a writing instructor, and myself. The TA's and I will grade the final papers. You are required to revise your initial draft of the brochure and the literature review before submitting final drafts. Final papers will be available on request for you to pick up at the end of the grading period or the beginning of the following term.\n\nPlagiarism Policy\n\nThis is a Communication Intensive class and its primary goal is to insure that you can communicate original ideas about the content of cognitive science in your own words. Consistent with university policy (please see the\nMIT webpage on Academic Integrity\n)\ncopied material not in quotation marks, whether verbatim or not, will be treated as plagiarism, even if the plagiarism is unintentional and even if the original reference is cited\n. Copied material takes credit for someone else's work and provides no evidence that you have fulfilled the communication requirement. If you have any questions about the difference between paraphrasing and plagiarizing, please consult the website and see a TA, a writing tutor, or me. Any form of plagiarism will result in a zero on the assignment and a record sent to the Office of Student Citizenship. It can result in hearing leading to expulsion from the institute.\n\nPlease let me know on an individual basis if you have a learning disability or other special concern you would like me to be aware of.\n\nClass Attendance/Participation\n\nAs much as possible for a relatively large, lecture-based introductory course, I try to make this a conversational, seminar-style class. See me if you have a disability that requires you to have a computer in class--otherwise,\nplease stick all electronic devices in your backpack before entering the room; they distract from thought and interaction\n. If you have an illness or emergency, please be sure a TA gets a note from student services and you will not be penalized for that day's mini-lecture.\n\nI do not use email as part of my teaching\n. A quality undergraduate education should encourage students to talk to professors (and vice-versa). Because email tends to discourage such communication, you may use email only to set up an appointment to meet with me. If you cannot make my office hours, I will make individual appointments. I generally reserve time before and after class as well. I also strongly encourage you to meet with the TA's and writing tutor.\n\nCalendar\n\nThis calendar outlines the proposed schedule. During the teaching of the course, the topics covered in each session shifted for some sessions. As a result, the topics covered in the\nlecture notes\nand the sessions they correlate with may differ from the table below.\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nNOTES\n\nCommonsense and cognitive science\n\n2*\n\nPiaget\n\nGroup practicum, brochure project, poster, and critical response papers assigned\n\n3*\n\nCentral debates, post-Piaget\n\nMethods assignment due the day after session #3 by email\n\nMethods 1\n\nMethods 2\n\n6*\n\nPerception\n\n7*\n\nObject knowledge\n\nCritical response due in class\n\n8*\n\nNumber\n\n9*\n\nStatistical learning\n\nTwo page proposal description due in class\n\nTopic seminars/CIM workshops: social cognition and brain disorders\n\nTopic seminars/CIM workshops: empathy and morality\n\nDeadline for critical response revisions (optional)\n\nTopic seminars/CIM workshops: music cognition, perception, and attention\n\nTopic seminars/CIM workshops: education and learning\n\nDraft of brochures due in class\n\nTopic seminars/CIM workshops: language, imagination, pretend play, and religion\n\nPoster session groups A/B\n\n16*\n\nComputational models of cognitive development/spatial navigation\n\n17*\n\nConcepts\n\n18*\n\nCausal reasoning\n\nDraft of literature review due in class\n\nBrochure drafts returned\n\n19*\n\nAgents and goals\n\n20*\n\nTheory of mind\n\n21*\n\nAutism\n\nFinal brochures due in class\n\n22*\n\nWord learning\n\nLiterature review drafts returned\n\n23*\n\nLanguage\n\n24*\n\nMoral reasoning\n\n25*\n\nImagination and pretend play\n\nFinal paper due in class\n\nPoster session groups C/D\n\nLast day of class\n\n*Daily mini-lecture session",

West.\n\"Teaching ESL students to read and write experimental research papers.\" In\nTESOL Quarterly 16 (1982): 333-347.\nThe overall structure of your 9.85 proposal is similar to that of a research paper:\n-Introduction provides general field or context.\n-Methods follows a particularized path, and focuses just on your project.\n-Discussion moves from specific findings to wider implications.\n\nNote the differences in verb\ntense.\nResearch\nPaper\nProposal\nIntroduction\nPast/present\nPast/present\nMethods\nPast\nFuture\nDiscussion\nPresent\nFuture\n\nIntroduction/\nLiterature\nReview\nThe function of the Introduction is to familiarize and orient your readers; for a proposal, the Introduction establishes\nyou as an authority in the field, and demonstrates that you are not reinventing the wheel. The content of the\nIntroduction depends on its purpose and the audience. Consider, for example, how the Introductions would differ for\nvarious grant-funding agencies (e.g., language vs. autism).\nNote the funnel-like structure of the Introduction: begin broadly; end with a focus on your project.\n\nCONTEXT\nJUSTIFICATION\nFOCUS\nThe Introduction has three\nelements.\nI arranged the three elements in the order in which you want to initially structure your Introduction:\nFocus: Define your research space, or \"stake out your territory\". What question are you addressing? What is your\nhypothesis? Although you end the Introduction with the focus or goal, it's best to identify your goal before you write\nyour Introduction.\nJustification: How does your work fit into and extend previous work? What is the motivation for your study?\nContext: Familiarizes your reader with the literature related to your study. Defining your focus and justification will\nhelp you determine what literature to cite as context.\n\nFor context, identify articles\nwith the proper databases.\nGoogle Scholar\nWikipedia\nPsycINFO\nISI Web of Science\nCited Reference Search\nImages: OpenClipArt. Public Domain.\nWikipedia is not peer-reviewed; Google Scholar does not have access to as many journals as PubMed.\nPsycINFO is the database for psychology journals.\nThe Cited Reference Search function of Web of Knowledge allows you to obtain articles that cite a particular article.\nPsycINFO: libraries.mit.edu/get/psycinfo\nWeb of Science: libraries.mit.edu/get/scie\n\nMIT libraries have numerous\nresources for you.\n-Vera\n-RefWorks\n-SFX\n-ILLiad@MIT\nMIT Vera for journals: http://vera.mit.edu/ .

Public Domain.\nMine\nbibliography\n-Summarize articles on notecards: For example, identify IMRD of each paper. Doing so will help you state these elements in your\nown words. Making a table of these elements for each paper can also help you see trends across papers.\n-Focus on the Introduction and Discussion sections of a paper: For a minireview, you want to convey the background and\nimplications of a topic. These types of information are most easily found in the Introduction and Discussion sections of a paper.\nTherefore, you don't need to read other sections as deeply.\n-Mine bibliography for more sources: Writers of research papers have also done literature searches. Take advantage of it.\nRemember, however, to always obtain and read the original source of information before you include the source in your own\nbibliography.\nMary-Lou Pardue of the Biology Department has a fantastic story illustrating the importance of tracking down original sources:\nFor a Project Lab, she and her lab partner were responsible for isolating an enzyme from Tetrahymena because the literature said\nthe enzyme was present in the organism. After much failure, Mary-Lou tracked down the original citation. This was in the days\nbefore electronic databases. She went to the library, climbed up a ladder, and blew off the dust from the journal volume. She also\nhad her German-English dictionary handy because the article was written in German. She found the name of the enzyme and\nTetrahymena, but the conclusion of the article was that Tetrahymena does not have the enzyme.\n\nCONTEXT\nJUSTIFICATION\nFOCUS\nOrganize your material to\nmake a funnel-like structure.\nI arranged the three elements in the order in which you want to initially structure your Introduction:\nFocus: Define your research space, or \"stake out your territory\".

Again using a similar experimental\nmodel as\n\nXu and Carey (1996), objects appeared from\nbehind a screen one at a time. In the two-word\ncondition, the experimenter said a different label for\neach object presented (e.g. \"look, a duck\"; or \"look, a\nball\"). In the one-word condition, the experimenter\nsaid the same label for both objects (e.g. \"look, a\ntoy\"). When two distinct labels were presented, infants\nwere able to establish a representation of two distinct\nobjects behind the screen.\nModel 9.85 Research Proposal\nMethod\nResults\n\nNote the different verb tenses.\nSpelke, Kestenbaum, Simons, and Wein (1995)\n(see also Spelke & Kestenbaum, 1986) and Xu and\nCarey (1996) found that at both 4 and 10 months,\ninfants are able to use spatiotemporal criteria for\nobject individuation, thus representing the sortal\nconcept physical object.\nXu, F.

In making an argumentative claim\nabout one's findings, one needs to start with the soundness of the findings themselves.\n-Claims: propositions, conclusions, judgments.\n-Evidence: data to support the claim\n-Assumptions: logical links between evidence and the claim.\n\nThe Discussion section has a\nparticular paragraph structure.\nThis finding is consistent with the ideas\npresented in Wilcox and Chapa (2004). They\nfound that infants succeeded in property-\nbased object individuation tasks when the\nobjects were associated with distinct\nfunctions, suggesting that the infants used\nthe function information to map objects to\nkind-categories. The present research shows\nan analogous effect with language labels.\nThus, object individuation based on property\ndifferences would be shown to be dependent\nupon an infant's ability to hold object kind-\nconcepts. This idea is also argued in\nWaxman and Markow (1998).\nModel 9.85 Research Proposal\nEvidence\nClaim\nAnalysis\n\nStart and end your Discussion\nlike an argument.\nIn each of the three experiments, [we expect that] 9-month-old\nand 12-month-old in\n\nfants [will succeed] in using property\ninformation...to complete a complex object individuation task\nwhen...given distinct labels for each of the objects...Furthermore,\nthe in\n\nfants [will] not succeed when a single la\n\nbel [is] provided for\nthe objects, indicating that the effect is not due to a simple increase\nin attention due to the presence of language.\n...\nIn sum, the fin\n\ndings of this study [will] suggest that language\n[plays] an important role in the development of object concepts.\nThe p\nresence of language la\n\nbels does influence an infant's ability to\ndiscern whether an object seen on occasion A is the same as an\nobject seen on occasion B by contributing to a mapping of object\ninformation to kind-categories. There is still much to determine\nabout the precise r ole of language in object concept development,\nand more broadly how closely language and conceptual thought\nmay be entwined.\nModel 9.85 Research Proposal\nFrom Day, Robert. How to Write and Publish a Scientific Paper, 5th ed.\n-Summarize findings presented in the Results section.\n-End with a short summary or conclusion about the work's importance.\nThe introductory paragraph could remind the reader of the focus and justification of the project. The conclusion\nparagraph should summarize the main finding and implications of the work.\nNote that for the Proposal, the proper verb tense is the future because you are discussing your expected results.\n\nCompare to literature and\ndraw implications.\nThis finding is consistent with the ideas presented in Wilcox and\nChapa (2004). They found that infants succeeded in property-based\nobject individuation tasks when the objects were associated with\ndistinct functions, suggesting that the infants used the function\ninformation to map objects to kind-categories. The present research\nshows an analogous effect with language labels. Thus, object\nindividuation based on property differences would be shown to be\ndependent upon an infant's ability to hold object kind-concepts. This\nidea is also argued in Waxman and Markow (1998).\nModel 9.85 Research Proposal\nSource: Day, Robert. How to Write and Publish a Scientific Paper, 5th ed.\n-Cite supporting literature.\n-Explain discrepancies between your findings and previous reports.\n-Point out shortcomings of your work and define unsettled points.\n-Discuss theoretical and practical implications of your work.\n\nPoint out shortcomings and\ndefine unsettled points.\nFurther research would be necessary to determine the precise role\nof language in complex object individuation tasks. In [my proposed]\nstudy, labels [will be] presented singularly, and without context. It\nis possible that word type may influence the role of language in\nobject individuation tasks.

      "content": "CHILDREN'S MUSEUM PUBLIC INFORMATION BROCHURE\n\nYour goal is to design a brochure that could provide useful information to a parent. You\nhave been assigned one of eight questions that a parent might have about child\ndevelopment. You should find and read 4-6 empirical papers on the topic and then\ncondense this material into a format that would be easily accessible to a parent. Note\nthat to identify 4-6 papers you want to read and cite, you might need to read the\nabstracts of 10-14 papers. You've been given a keyword to search and the name of\none of the leading authorities on the topic. A good strategy is to read their work and\nthen look at the abstract of either additional studies on the topic by this author or\nstudies they cite. Note, that this is very different from the critical response paper. Instead\nof carefully discussing the methods of a particular study, you need to decide for yourself\nwhat findings are important and well supported by the literature. These main points\nshould then be communicated in a way that is clear and substantive, but not laden with\nexperimental details.\n\nThe brochure should be 1,000 words or less. You will submit a draft of this and then be\ngiven feedback and asked to revise it for a grade and final approval. The top 3-5\nbrochures will be sent to the Boston Children's Museum and if approved will be made\navailable to the public.\n\nRequirements:\n\n-\nFind 4-6 empirical papers on your assigned topic (see above and we can help you\nwith this)\n-\nSynthesize into easily understandable, informative text (<1000 words)\n-\nIncorporate text and visual aids into three panel brochure\n(we will give you some examples of good text and layouts)\n-\nYou are required to submit a rough draft of this project for comments.\n-\nMake revisions\n-\nSubmit final version.\n\nImportant Dates:\n\nSession 13: Rough drafts due in class\n\nSession 18: Drafts returned\n\nSession 21: Final drafts due in class\n\nMy four-year-old has an imaginary friend he calls \"Stuffie\".

But when I ask her to give me\n3 crackers (or 3 pens, or 4 crayons, or whatever) she just gives me a handful,\n(although she reliably can hand me 2). I've tried and tried to teach her numbers\nlarger than 2 but she still doesn't get it. Why can she count to 14 but can't figure\nout what numbers mean? Should I worry that she has some form of math\ndyslexia? (search number, Susan Carey)\n\n2. I heard that newborn babies look at faces.

Neither my wife nor I speak a second language\nbut we'd really like our child to be comfortable in another language. We're\nthinking about playing tapes of Sesame Street in Spanish for our 12-month-old.\nWill he have an easier time learning Spanish later if we keep this up for the next\ncouple of years? (search social interaction phonetic learning, Patricia Kuhl)\n\n7. My fifth grader seems to have low self-esteem. I keep telling her she's smart and\npraising her all I can but whenever she has a choice, she always chooses easy\nassignments instead of hard ones. She even sometimes exaggerates her test scores\nto make them seem better than they are. My brother's a psychologist and he says\nI should praise her efforts not her intelligence.

      "content": "General Guidelines for Critical Responses\n- Focus the discussion on your paper's specific results: avoid long summaries of\nbackground discussion that's only indirectly related to the paper - e.g. what the main\npreviously held views in the field were. This background is important to\nunderstanding the paper, but with less than two pages of space, it's better to jump\nright to the point.\n- When summarizing the paper's experimental design and results, it's helpful to\nmention the key controls in the paper:\no What were they, and what were they intended to control for?\no Do the controls test for what they're intended to test?\n- When proposing future experiments, explain clearly what questions they are meant to\ntest, and why these are not addressed by the current paper's experiments. It would be\nnice to also mention controls you might run for your future experiments.\n- Several students suggested the use of eye tracking and brain imaging in future\nexperiments. If you propose such \"high-tech\" expensive experiments, explain what\nquestion or insight you expect to get from them. For example, in the case of brain\nimaging, simply looking for \"the neural correlates of X\" is not motivation enough on\nits own, since this is often tangential to the main paper's questions or research aims.\nUsing an eye tracker to simply be \"more quantitative\" is also not enough of a\nmotivation, unless you explain how the quantitative data will address a new question\n(that's relevant to the paper's study), or rule out certain hypotheses.\n- Also, when proposing these high tech experiments, consider the difficulties of getting\nthe method to work in your subjects' age range, interpreting the data that these\nmethods generate, the potential confounds they introduce, and whether all of these are\noutweighed by the insights the new method might yield. For instance, it's not clear\nthat subjects in the age ranges tested in many of the papers can even be reliably\nimaged or eye tracked. In the case of imaging, some proposals argued for the use of\nimaging between adult and very young subjects. This comparison could introduce\nmany confounds due to biological changes that result from aging in the brain... are\nthese confounds easier to deal with than the behavioral measures the paper used?\nSome general guidelines and things to avoid:\n- Avoid discussion of the statistics of the paper, unless it's absolutely essential (in\n99.9% of the cases it won't be, especially for this batch of papers). If the authors\nclaim their results are statistically significant, take them at their word. For example,\nsuggesting that the \"sample size might be too small\" to warrant significance would\nnot be a valid critique. On the flip side, the fact that a paper reports statistically\nsignificant results does not really count as a positive feature of the paper. If the results\nweren't statistically significant, they probably wouldn't make it to the journal in\nwhich the paper was published. So don't cite this as a positive aspect of the paper.\n- Avoid critiques that are very generic, i.e. critiques that could be applied to virtually\nany study in the field. For example, if looking times are taken to be a measure of\ninfants' surprise in the field, it's not constructive to critique any particular paper for\ninterpreting looking times in this way, unless there's something specific to that\n\npaper's experimental design/interpretation that makes looking times inappropriate or\nmisleading. To give another example: if a study shows a phenomena in a very early\nage (e.g. 1 month olds) and concludes that this is likely to be governed by an innate\nmechanism, it's logically correct, but not very illuminating, to point out that it could\nstill be learned from experience in between age zero and whatever age was tested.\nExperimenters must test subjects at some age, and the earlier you go the harder it is to\nexecute experiments that address interesting questions. In short, a good rule of thumb\nis: if your critique could be applied to just about any paper in the field, without any\nreferences to the details of that paper and the questions it's addressing, you're\nprobably not being specific enough.\n- The same rule holds true for praise of the paper. The fact that the authors did not\ninform parents of the purposes of the study so as to prevent them from biasing their\nchildren's responses is not praise worthy, since it's just standard good practice.\n- Avoid suggesting experimental changes/future experiments that are very generic and\ncould theoretically improve any study. For example, suggesting that a wider range of\nages should be tested, or that more subjects could be tested to make the results more\nrobust, is not typically helpful to the authors. Is there a specific reason why the\ncurrent age range tested is not appropriate for answering the question that\nexperimenters set out to answer? What would be gained by expanding the age ranges,\nand to what age ranges in particular? Likewise, why add more subjects to the study?\nIs there any reason to believe that the current subject pool does not constitute an\nessentially random sample for the study's purposes?\n- Avoid questioning the credibility/reliability of the experimenters or authenticity of the\ndata. If the experimenters report certain data, again, take their word for it. For\nexample, even though it's logically possible that the person coding the result of a\nparticular experiment made a mistake, this is not a constructive criticism. Take the\ndata as is, and focus instead on the experimental design, whether it addresses the\noriginal question, whether the controls test what they're intended to test, what some\nmajor confounding factors might be, etc.\nSome writing guidelines:\n- It is easier to follow your reasoning if you start by introducing the paper's goals, then\nbriefly summarizing the experimental design/controls, and only then offering your\ncritiques and ideas for future experiments. It's generally confusing to simultaneously\ncritique and summarize the paper.\n- Rethink very harsh language, whether for praise or criticism: it's hard to \"prove\"\nthings in any experimental science... does the experiment really prove that X? Also,\noften questioning things like the \"credibility\" or \"authenticity\" of the experimenters\nand/or their data comes off as quite harsh (and usually is unsupported by any\nevidence from the paper's contents.)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.85 Infant and Early Childhood Cognition\nFall 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Tips on Reading Research Articles Critically\n... and writing your Critical Response Papers\n\nHere are some tips on what to look for when reading research articles critically and writing your responses.\n\nThe questions below are ones you can consider and discuss whether you answer each one affirmatively (i.e. you\nfeel the authors did this successfully) or negatively (i.e. you feel this aspect was lacking/ problematic in their\npaper); the important part is that you articulate why you feel this way when writing your review.\n\n**********************\nFirst paragraph (no more than 1⁄2 page): summarize what question the authors were trying to\nanswer, and describe what they did (i.e. the design)\nThe rest: criticism/review part....\n\nyou can approach this in sort of a logical order, as follows:\n\n1. Do the authors convince you that the research question is an important one? What's the hypothesis\nthey're testing?\n\n2. Does the design of the experiment allow for a good logical fit between the question & the task?\n-\nWhat prediction does their hypothesis make? Does that seem sensible?\n-\nCan you think of other predictions their hypothesis makes (i.e. about how kids ought to perform\non this task, assuming their hypothesis is true?... or assuming some competing hypothesis is\ntrue/false?)\n3. Does the dependent measure they used make sense? Are there other measures (given the task they\nwere using) that you wish they'd reported, or are just plain curious about? Any confounds?\n-\ndoes passing their task necessarily indicate what they take it to indicate? (think, eg.: are there\nother ways the children could pass the task? )\n-\ndoes failing the task necessarily indicate what they take it to indicate? (think, eg.: are there other\nways kids could fail? Were there other task demands-- things that were unrelated to what the task\nwas designed to measure-- that might have made it hard for kids to demonstrate existing\ncompetence, for example was the task inappropriately verbal? Were test questions worded in a\nconfusing or ambiguous way? Did the training phase introduce some sort of bias?, etc.)\n4. Did they control for everything they needed to in order to plausibly make their case [note: they\ndon't need to control for absolutely everything, but they do need to control for any factors that plausibly\ncould influence performance or interfere with interpretation]?\n\n- Are there other controls you can think of that should be run?\n-\nIf you were doing this experiment, are there things you would do differently--if so, why?\n5. Did their interpretation of subjects' performance make sense? Did they address all of their findings\n(including both what was similar between subjects and what was different; or what was similar between\nconditions/trials and what was different?) Did their explanations make sense?\n\n6. *Can you think of alternative explanations for their findings [this is a very important one!!]\n\n7. Throughout the paper, do they substantiate all of the claims they make (with empirical evidence,\nand not just theory, logic, or intuition)?\n-\nare their findings consistent with related studies in the field (based on what you know about the\nliterature and those the authors discuss)? If they are inconsistent, do the authors discuss this\nconvincingly/appropriately?\n8. By the end of the paper, have the authors addressed everything they said they would (in their\nintro)?\n\n9. What do you think about their \"big picture\" conclusions (typically, at the end of the discussion\nsection)? Are there additional follow-up experiments or questions you think would be relevant and\ninteresting for future investigations?\n\n**************************************************\n\nSo here's the idea for the criticism part: treat each of these as independent entities. That\nis, it's best to take on the first question there [is the research question important?],\ndiscuss it, and then put your views on it aside before moving on to #2, saying to\nyourself \"Okay, *given* that that's their research question, how do I feel about question\n#2 there [on the relation b/w the question & the experimental design/task used]?\" Then\nafter you address that, set your views aside and say, \"Okay, *given* that that's the task\nthey decided to use, how do I feel about question #3 [their dependent measure(s)]?\",\nand so on, as you proceed through the list.\n\nYou need not address each and every question 1-9 above--particularly, if you are facing a page/length limit.\nAddressing a subset of them thoughtfully is better than addressing all of them superficially.\n\nThe bullet points are some things to look for, but they may or may not be relevant for the particular paper you\nreview; I just figured I'd include them to get you started and suggest what kinds of things you want to keep in\nmind.\n\nEven really excellent studies that are worthy of publication often come back from reviewers with various criticisms\nor suggestions (see, for example the sample \"good\" review that's up on stellar), so don't be shy about critiquing\neach of these aspects of your chosen article. As an intellectual/academic exercise, for this class, it's better to err\non the over-critical side than the under-critical side, and you certainly shouldn't feel hesitant, or question your right\nto do so (eg. \"Well, these smart folks from a lab at Stanford did it this way, and I'm sure they know better than I\nwould about how to do this stuff,\" etc).\n\nIt is the authors' responsibility to lay out their research question, methodology,\npredictions, findings, and interpretation in a way that makes sense to the reader; if you\nhave doubts or confusion about any aspects, the important thing is to cogently explain\nwhy.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.85 Infant and Early Childhood Cognition\nFall 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Supplementary notes for lecture 8:\nComputational modeling of cognitive development\n\nSlide 1\n\nWhy computational modeling is important for studying cognitive development.\n\nLet's think about how to study the mind and brain. Why would taking a\ncomputational approach be useful? To show you why, I'm going to give an example\nnot about the brain but about this artifact here.\n\nSlides 2-3\n\nHere is an artifact that looks like a simple candle, but it has some additional\nproperties. There are some markings on the back, there's a metal base, and there's a\nnail attached to it. Here is a drawing that makes it easier to see all the parts.\n\nImagine that for some reason, you want to be able to predict how this artifact\nbehaves with very high accuracy.\n\nSlide 4\n\nOne way you can solve this problem is by taking a bottom-up approach. The idea is\nthat if you're trying to understand something that is very complex, you can break it\ndown into its most basic parts. Once you understand the basic components, and how\nthey interact with each other, you can make a model of the system and predict its\nfuture states.\n\nSlide 5\n\nWith this artifact, you might begin by studying the basic properties of wax. Then you\ncan move on to studying the properties of the flame. You can study the material the\nnail is made of, and you can look at its precise shape. You can make very precise\nmeasurements of the markings on the back and you can study everything about the\nmetal plate on the bottom.\n\nOnce you understand all of this, you can predict what will happen to the whole\nsystem. If you find one of these artifacts, you can change a few parameters in your\nmodel, run a simulation, and predict what the artifact will be like at any given time.\nAgain, this type of approach is called bottom-up.\n\nSlides 6-11\n\nThe top-down approach takes the opposite perspective. The idea in the top-down\napproach is that if you're trying to understand a system that serves some function,\nyou can begin by figuring out what that function is. Once you know that, you can\n\nthen begin to understand what each component does in relation to its functional\npurpose.\n\nIf we take a top-down approach with our artifact we would begin by trying to figure\nout what its function is. If you did this, you would notice that these artifacts are only\nused in the nighttime. You would see that every night a person comes up, looks at\nthe markings in the back, puts a nail in the candle, lights the candle, and goes to bed.\nAs the night passes the flame keeps burning until the wax holding the nail melts. The\nnail falls down and hits the metal base making a loud noise. This sound wakes the\nperson up and then the candle is extinguished.\n\nNotice the difference of what you understand using each of the two approaches.\nSomeone who took a bottom-up approach might be able to predict the future states\nof the artifact, without ever knowing that the artifact is an antique alarm clock. In\ncontrast, someone who took the top-down approach might not know anything about\nthe specific properties of wax, or about the exact shape of the nail, but knowing that\nthe object is an alarm clock allows her to predict what will happen in the future. If\nyou know that the artifact is an alarm clock, you can look where the nail is placed\nrelative to the markings in the back and you'll be able to predict when the artifact\nwill make a loud noise, without any need to simulate the underlying complex\nphysical process that led to it.\n\nSlide 12\n\nIn this example, the top-down approach lets us realize that the candle artifact serves\nthe same function as mechanical or an electrical alarm clocks. You can understand\nthat they are all performing the same function using different physical\nimplementations (wax and nails, springs and gears, and capacitors and transistors),\nand different algorithms (through burning wax, having springs oscillate, or by\ncharging capacitors). And this type of understanding can be much more difficult to\nreach through a bottom-up approach.\n\nThese three levels of understanding that you could have -The function or\ncomputation, the algorithm, and the implementation- are known as Marr's three\nlevels of analysis.\n\nA full theory of the mind and brain (or of alarm clocks) must be able to explain what\nis happening on all three levels, but where we should begin is still an open question,\nby studying the implementation (bottom-up), or the computation (top-down).\n\nThe top-down approach is convenient from an artificial intelligence perspective. If\nwe can understand how intelligence works at the computational level, then we may\nbe able to implement it using different algorithms in different technologies.\n\nSlides 13-14\n\nSo far we've only been talking about how to study alarm clocks. What about the\nbrain? Intuitively, there's something off with the analogy. Alarm clocks were\ndesigned to serve some function, is this true for the brain as well? This is a difficult\nquestion, but many people believe this is the case. The brain evolved to perform\ncertain computations, just like other organs. We can understand other organs purely\nat the functional level: Hearts pump blood, lungs transport oxygen into the\nbloodstream, etc. Much in the same way, we can assume the brain is serving some\nfunction, take a top-down approach, and see how far this takes us.\n\nSlides 15-16\n\nTo recapitulate, we want to find what we gain by studying the mind and brain at the\ncomputational level of analysis, where we want to understand the logic of\ncomputations, not the specific algorithm of implementation.\n\nThere are many ways we can do this. Every approach has its strengths and\nweaknesses, but they all have the same underlying philosophy. Here we'll focus on\nBayesian models of cognition because they've been pretty successful in helping us\nunderstand many aspects of higher-level cognition in recent years.\n\nSlide 17\n\nWe need to make some initial assumptions to get off the ground. We don't know\nhow the mind represents knowledge, but we are going to assume that our belief\nabout anything can be quantified and that we can assign it a real number between 0\nand 1, where 0 is something like \"definitely not true,\" 1 is \"definitely true,\" and 0.5 is\ncomplete uncertainty.\n\nWe can use this scale to describe how certain we are that this animal is a cow, that\nthis baby is happy, or that the yellow blocks will be the first to fall if this table were\nbumped.\n\nSlides 18-22\n\nOnce we've made this assumption, we can use Bayes' rule to describe how our\nbeliefs change as we interact with the world. Intuitively, Bayes' rule tells us that the\nbelief that a hypothesis is true given the evidence we observe is proportional to the\nbelief we had in the hypothesis before observing the data (your prior belief) times\nthe likelihood that you would have observed that data if the hypothesis were true.\n\nSlides 23-30\n\nTo get a better idea of how Bayes' rule works in cognition, let's look at a toy example\nin world learning. Imagine you're trying to figure out what the word \"Dier\" means.\nYou know it means \"Animal\", \"Mammal\", or \"Giraffe\", but you don't which one it is.\n\nThese are our hypotheses and since we have no idea which one is true we assign a\nprior probability of 1/3 to each.\n\nOne day, you're walking with your friend (who doesn't speak English) and you come\nacross four animals: An alligator, a giraffe, a tiger, and an elephant. You friend points\nto the giraffe and calls it a Dier. Now you can use Bayesian inference to update your\nbelief on what Dier means. If Dier meant \"animal\" the chance of your friend pointing\nat the giraffe is 1/4 (there are four animals). If Dier meant \"mammal\" then the\nlikelihood of your friend pointing at the giraffe is 1/3. And if Dier meant \"giraffe\"\nthen the likelihood of your friend pointing at the giraffe is 1. By multiplying your\nprior belief in each hypothesis by how likely it is that your friend would've called\nthe giraffe a Dier under each of them, we can get the posterior belief. After\nnormalizing the distribution, the updated belief that \"Dier\" means \"animal\",\n\"mammal\", or \"giraffe\" is .16, .21, and .63 respectively.\n\nSlides 31-42\n\nAs our friend keeps pointing at other animals and calling them \"Dier\" we can\ncontinue using Bayesian inference to update our beliefs, giving us a model of how\nwe can learn the meaning of a word in a very simple setting.\n\nSlide 43\n\nSo far we've just outlined a normative model that tells us how to integrate\ninformation into a probabilistic framework and make rational inferences. But the\nlast 10 or so years have found that these models predict very accurately how\nhumans reason in many domains ranging from theory of mind, to intuitive physical\nreasoning, to pragmatic inferences in language.\n\nSo we know that adults do something like Bayesian inference. Although there is\nsome evidence that our brain actually is doing Bayesian inference in many tasks, all\nwe need is the weaker claim that the brain is doing something that is\ncomputationally equivalent to Bayesian inference. A way to think about this is like\ntrying to model an alarm clock made of electrical circuits and showing that it is\nfunctionally equivalent to a mechanical alarm clock, without making any claims as to\nwhether the mechanical alarm clock is using the same algorithms.\n\nSlides 44-46\n\nWe've talked about why it's a good idea to take a top-down approach to study\ncognition, we have a general framework to build computational models, and we\nhave evidence that adults reason in a way that's predicted by these Bayesian\ninference models. What do we gain from using the same approach to study\ndevelopment?\n\nThere are many reasons why these models would be helpful for studying\ndevelopment, but the main point that cognitive scientists have made is that the most\ndifficult problems in cognition, the problems we are the furthest from solving, are\nthe problems that every five-year-old has solved. If we could formalize what the\ncore components of each domain of knowledge are, and how children learn, then\nwe'll have a computational solution to all of these problems.\n\nSlides 47-48\n\nIf you combine Bayesian inference with the Theory Theory - the idea that\nknowledge is structured in the form of causal theories - we can use Bayesian\ninference to try to find the best theory that explains the data, design an experiment\nwhere we can give infants or toddlers the same data that we give to our model and\nthen compare how well the model's predictions match infant/toddler behavior.\n\nSlide 49\n\nIn past lectures we've already read some papers that have taken this approach,\nwhere the authors were able to get a better idea of how infants make inferences on\nsome tasks by comparing their behavior to normative Bayesian models.\n\nSlides 50-52\n\nFor example, in Gweon et. al. 2010, the authors measured how much infants\nexpected the new balls to squeak by looking at how long the infant tried to make a it\nsqueak. Using this measure they were able to compare how certain the infants were\nthat the balls squeaked to how much confidence a normative Bayesian model would\nhave had under different sampling assumptions. This way, the authors were able to\nfigure out what sampling assumptions the infants were making by showing how\nwell the model predicted the behavioral data.\n\nSlide 53\n\nConclusion of slides\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.85 Infant and Early Childhood Cognition\nFall 2012\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

When Americans do think about\nglobalization, they think of the global economy as an enlarged version of the American economy.\n(Source: Thurow, L. (1993). Fortune Favors the Bold (p. 6). New York: Harper Collins. )\nPlagiarism\nAccording to Lester Thurow (1993), Americans fear globalization less than people from other\ncountries and as a consequence spend less time thinking about it. Indeed, Americans see\nglobalization as an enlarged version of their own economy.\nWhy is this plagiarism?\nThe writer has used Thurow's exact words without enclosing them in quotation marks. S/he has only\nsubstituted synonyms here and there. Even though Thurow is credited with a citations, this would be\nconsidered plagiarism.\n(Complete Thurow reference appears in bibliography)\nParaphrasing\nLester Thurow (1993) maintains that because Americans see globalization simply as a bigger form\nof their own economy, they are less concerned about it than is the rest of the world.\nWhy is this acceptable?\nThe writer has kept the meaning of the original passage without copying words or structure. Words\nlike globalization and Americans are generic terms (i.e., terms that are commonly used for the\nconcept they illustrate - it is difficult to find synonyms for them). Thus you may use these words\nwithout placing\n\nMy favorite notice on a faculty\nweb page\n\"Prof. Dreyfus suffers from a mild case of\nprosopagnosia or \"face blindness\".

Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across\ncontexts, not accounted for by general developmental delays, and\nmanifest by all 3 of the following:\n1.\nDeficits in social-emotional reciprocity ...\n2.\nDeficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social\ninteraction ...\n3.\nDeficits in developing and maintaining relationships, appropriate to\ndevelopmental level (beyond those with caregivers) ...\nB. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities as\nmanifested by at least two of the following:\n1.\nStereotyped or repetitive speech, motor movements, or use\nof objects.\n2.\nExcessive adherence to routines ...\n3.\nHighly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in\nintensity or focus ...\n4.\nHyper-or hypo-reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest\nin sensory aspects of environment; ...\nC. Symptoms must be present in early childhood (but may not\nbecome fully manifest until social demands exceed limited\ncapacities)\nD.\nSymptoms together limit and impair everyday functioning.\n\nDiagnosis\n- Many children with autism have:\n- Abnormal sensory experiences\n- Sound of rain, telephone, vacuum cleaner, waves may\nbe painful\n- Touch of clothes, light brush painful\n- But may be oblivious to traumatic injury (broken arm;\nhead bash) or extreme cold and heat\n- Mental retardation\n- 33%-50% insufficient language to communicate\ndaily needs\n- 1:4 develop seizures\n- Other disorders -- Fragile X; tuberous sclerosis;\nPKU; allergies\n\nDiagnosis\n- Some babies appear to have early\nabnormalities -- lack of normal attachment,\ndislike of touch ...\n- However, at least 20% of babies appear to\nexperience \"regression\" -- normal\ndevelopment followed by loss of words,\nsocial contact around 18-months.\n- 3-25% of children diagnosed with ASD\nbefore 3 recover; lose the diagnosis by 6.\n\nEarly diagnosis\n- Modified CHAT -- Checklist for Autism in\nToddlers (validated for use between\n16-30 months\n\nM-CHAT Autism screening checklist removed due to copyright restrictions. http://www.firstsigns.org/downloads/m-chat.PDF\nSource: Robins, Diana L., Deborah Fein, et al. \"The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers: An Initial Study Investigating\nthe Early Detection of Autism.\" Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 31, no. 2 (2001): 131-44.\n\nEarly diagnosis\n- Failing any 2 of 7 key questions, 2, 5,\n7, 9, 13, 15, 23 or any 6 of the 23\nquestions indicates need for follow-up.\nGood confirmatory power (proportion of children\nalready diagnosed with ASD identified by the CHAT):\n97%\nGood specificity (proportion of children without ASD\nidentified as normal): 95% (i.e., few false positives)\nLow sensitivity (proportion of children who tested fine\nbut were later diagnosed): 36% (many false\nnegatives)\n\nAutistic syndrome disorders\n1.

Recent\nreports suggest that the incidence of autism may be substantially\nincreasing.

This increase is largely\nattributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns,\navailability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness,[149][150]\nthough unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out.\"\nSource: Wikipedia contributors, \"Autism,\" Wikipedia, The Free\nEncyclopedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism.\n\nAutism increasing?\n- Possibilities\n- The increase is real and some environmental\nfactor is causing it.\n- The increase is an artifact of better/changing\ndiagnoses\n- Most of the increase is due to diagnoses of high IQ\nchildren with ASD.\n- In low IQ children, there has been a corresponding\nfall-off in diagnoses of mental retardation\n- More public awareness, more populations sampled,\nmore reporting of ASD with comorbidity (Cerebral\npalsy, Tourrettes, Downs, etc.)\n\nAutism and vaccinations?\n- Five large epidemiological studies conducted\nin the United States, the United Kingdom,\nDenmark, and Sweden since 2001\nconsistently provided evidence that there is\nno association between thimerosal-containing\nvaccines and autism.

Although\nmany ... interventions have some positive evidence,\nsuggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no\ntreatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews\nof hese studies has generally been poor, their clinical results\nare mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the\nrelative effectiveness of treatment options. ... claims that\nintervention by around age three years is crucial are not\nsubstantiated.\"\nSource: Wikipedia contributors, \"Autism therapies,\" Wikipedia,\nThe Free Encyclopedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nAutism_therapies.\n\nEarly intervention effective\nbut not overwhelming\n\"Recent reviews highlight limitations in the evidence base for early\ninterventions for children with autism. We conducted a systematic\nreview of controlled studies of early intensive behavioral interventions\n(EIBI) for young children with autism. Eleven studies met inclusion\ncriteria (including two randomized controlled trials). At group level,\nEIBI resulted in improved outcomes (primarily measured by IQ)\ncompared to comparison groups. At an individual level, however, there\nwas considerable variability in outcome, with some evidence that\ninitial IQ (but not age) was related to progress. This review provides\nevidence for the effectiveness of EIBI for some, but not all, preschool\nchildren with autism.\"\nHowlin, Patricia, Iliana Magiati, et al. \"Systematic Review of Early Intensive Behavioral Interventions for Children\nWith Autism.\" American Journal on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. 114, no. 1 (2009): 23-41.\n\nWhy? Parents try multiple\ninterventions\nMany \"name-brand\" programs have been developed to treat\nchildren with ASD (e.g. floor time, Relationship\nDevelopment Intervention /RDI, Lovaas therapy, etc)\nBut, the presence or absence of research support does not\nappear to impact parents' or service providers' choice of\ntreatments\nGreen et al. (2006) found in an internet survey that 108\ntreatments were currently being or had been used by at\nleast one parent.\nThe average number of individual treatments currently used\nby parents was 7\nBopp, Smith, Mirenda, 2006\n\nSo do providers\nStahmer et al. (2005) examined primary service\nproviders for children with autism. They reported:\nusing up to 30 different intervention models\nresearch base for the programs implemented was rarely\nconsidered when choosing an intervention practice\nwhen evidence-based practices were implemented, they\nwere often modified significantly (e.g. program\nmethodologies were combined to fit child characteristics\nor programs were adapted to fit teacher preferences).\nFinally, the majority of EI providers reported that they\ndid not receive adequate training on any of the\nmodels they implemented.\nBopp, Smith, Mirenda, 2006\n\nAutistic syndrome disorders\n1.
