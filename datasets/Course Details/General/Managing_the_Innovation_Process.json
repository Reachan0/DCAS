  "course_name": "Managing the Innovation Process",
  "course_description": "This course approaches “managing the innovation process” through five levels of analysis: individual, team, network, organizational, and industrial. At each level of analysis, particular attention is given to the conditions under which innovation processes succeed and fail. The weekly readings consist of a mixture of book chapters, journal articles, and cases, and an online forum will be used for further discussion of the required readings outside of class. Tuesday classes will begin with a reflection exercise that entails critical thinking about the topic for the week, followed by an activity and lecture introducing material found both within and outside of the readings. Thursday classes will begin with a case analysis completed in small groups, followed by a discussion based on the issues raised in the case and online forum. The primary goal of the course is to expose students to a variety of perspectives on innovation, while building on past work experiences and preparing for work experiences in the future.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 3 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nClass Participation\n\nEach student will be expected to come to class prepared to actively participate in discussions. In particular, the reflection exercise will be collected as a measure of participation and as a way for the instructor to get to know each student.\n\nCase Analysis\n\nOnce a week, 3-4 person groups (assigned by the instructor each week) will be responsible for completing an in-class case analysis. The analysis should integrate previous experiences and materials from required readings, activities, and lectures. In fairness to other group members, students should read the case thoroughly before coming to class.\n\nBook Review\n\nEach student will choose one book from the list of suggested books (or another one approved by the instructor) and complete a 3-5 page book review. Book reviews should apply concepts learned in class to the ideas presented in the book.\n\nFinal Paper\n\nThe final 10-15 page paper will give students the chance to more closely examine a weekly topic from the course. A list of supplemental readings is provided and the paper should include citations from the selected week. The final paper may take one of three forms:\n\nCase Study - illustrate how experiences in a company relate to one of the weekly topics\n\nCritical Essay - write an analytical assessment of one of the weekly topics\n\nResearch Report - empirically investigate an idea related to one of the weekly topics\n\nGrading\n\nClass Participation - 15%\n\nOnline Forum - 15%\n\nCase Analysis - 40%\n\nBook Review - 10%\n\nFinal Paper - 20%\n\nInnovation Points\n\nTo encourage regular feedback and the ongoing integration of new ideas into the course, students will receive an \"innovation point\" for each suggested innovation that is implemented during the semester. Course innovations can include novel improvements to the online forum, exposure to unique web resources, and original activities for fostering classroom interaction. The key to a successful innovation is that, at a minimum, it benefits all students in the class. Innovation points accumulated throughout the semester will be applied to the Final Paper. For example, if you received an 88/100 on the Final Paper, and earned 2 innovation points during the semester, then your grade would be bumped up to a 90/100. In addition, you will be recognized in front of your peers for making an innovative contribution to the course. Happy innovating!",
