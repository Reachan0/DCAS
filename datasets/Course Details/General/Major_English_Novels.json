It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the style guides available at the\nWriting and Communication Center\nand the\nMIT Web site on Plagiarism\n.\n\nCalendar\n\nSES #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nIntroductions\n\nDefoe, Daniel. \"\nMoll Flanders\n.\"\n\nDefoe, Daniel. \"\nMoll Flanders\n.\" (cont.)\n\nDefoe, Daniel. \"\nMoll Flanders\n.\" (cont.)\n\nEarly Novels posted\n\nBurney, Frances. \"\nEvelina\n.\" Volume I\n\nBurney, Frances. \"\nEvelina\n.\" Volume II\n\nBurney, Frances. \"\nEvelina\n.\" Volume III\n\nAusten, Jane. \"\nPride & Prejudice\n.\" Volume I\n\nAusten, Jane. \"\nPride & Prejudice\n.\" Volume II\n\nAusten, Jane. \"\nPride & Prejudice\n.\" Volume III\n\nGaskell, Elizabeth. \"\nMary Barton\n.\" Chapters 1-10\n\nGaskell, Elizabeth. \"\nMary Barton\n.\" Chapters 11-23\n\nGaskell, Elizabeth. \"\nMary Barton\n.\" Chapters 24-38\n\n\"Early Novels\" essay assignment due\n\nEliot, George. \"\nAdam Bede\n.\" Book 1\n\nEliot, George. \"\nAdam Bede\n.\" Books 2-4\n\nEliot, George. \"\nAdam Bede\n.\" Books 5-6\n\n19th-20th Century Novels posted\n\nBraddon, Mary Elizabeth. \"\nLady Audley's Secret\n.\" Volume I\n\nBraddon, Mary Elizabeth. \"\nLady Audley's Secret\n.\" Volume II\n\nBraddon, Mary Elizabeth. \"\nLady Audley's Secret\n.\" Volume III\n\nHardy, Thomas. \"\nTess of the D'Urbervilles\n.\" Phases 1-3\n\nHardy, Thomas. \"\nTess of the D'Urbervilles\n.\" Phases 4-6\n\nHardy, Thomas. \"\nTess of the D'Urbervilles\n.\" Phase 7\n\nWoolf, Virginia. \"\nMrs Dalloway\n.\" pp. 3-102\n\nWoolf, Virginia. \"\nMrs Dalloway\n.\" pp. 102-194\n\nWoolf, Virginia. \"\nMrs Dalloway\n.\"\n\n\"19th-20th Century Novels\" essay assignment due",
