Topics include educational theory, educational psychology, and theories of learning. Assignments include readings from educational literature, written reflections on classroom observations, presentations on class topics, and practice teaching. Classroom observation is a key component.\n\nThe MIT/Wellesley Scheller Teacher Education Program\n\nThe\nMIT/Wellesley Scheller Teacher Education Program\n(STEP) prepares MIT and Wellesley College students to become teachers who are:\n\nCompetent to teach in their field and not afraid to challenge established norms.\n\nAble to bridge the boundaries among disciplines.\n\nEager to help students develop the desire to question and explore that is so much a part of the MIT experience.\n\nQualify for an initial license to teach in Massachusetts.\n\nMain Activities\n\nContinue teaching one class through mid March.\n\nLocate and use outside resources (e.g. journals, web, other texts) to support your teaching.\n\nSeek ways to use technology to enhance your instruction.\n\nJournal your teaching experience. The journal will provide the basis for your final reflective paper.\n\nComplete the\nPreservice Performance Assessment Practicum (PDF)\nform.\n\nObserve and interview two experienced instructors at your school who teach heterogeneously grouped classes. Write a paper describing the classroom observations and your interview with the instructor. Be sure to include what you learned. Address the question of heterogeneous grouping from your perspective, from the teacher's perspective and from the perspective of three articles on this subject, pro and con.\n\nComplete a special project that benefits students and/or school at which you did your student teaching.\n\nCompose a course expectation handout for your students, detailing your expectations, rules and procedures.\n\nCompose your resume for the purpose of obtaining a teaching job.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nClass attendance.\n\nFinish your field work. Detail your weekly teaching in your reflective journal. Keep your written practicum log up to date.\n\nComplete assignments. (For details, see the\nAssignments\nsection.)\n\nGrading\n\nYour grade is based on you completing the \"Course Requirements\" as listed above. The grading criteria are:\n\nExceptionally good performance demonstrating a superior understanding of the subject matter, a foundation of extensive knowledge, and a skillful use of concepts and materials.\n\nAdhere to excellent teacher habits (prompt, prepared, ready to learn).\n\nActively participate in class adding depth to discussions and activities.\n\nDemonstrate excellent communication skills verbally and in writing.\n\nMeet deadlines for assigned work.\n\nGood performance, demonstrating capacity to use the appropriate concepts, a good understanding of the subject matter, and an ability to handle the problems and materials encountered in the subject.\n\nActively participate in class.\n\nDemonstrate good communication skills verbally and in writing.\n\nAdhere to excellent teacher habits most of the time.\n\nMeet deadlines for most assigned work.\n\nAdequate performance, demonstrating an adequate understanding of the subject matter, an ability to handle relatively simple problems, and an adequate preparation for moving on to more advanced work in the field.\n\nParticipation in class may be limited.\n\nCommunication skills (verbal and/or written) require more study.\n\nTeacher habits of prompt, prepared and ready are not met in a reliable fashion.\n\nDeadlines are not met for a significant portion of the work.\n\nPerformance not acceptable for teaching.\n\nGrading rubric for written assignments:\n\nPoints\n\nCriteria\n\nPoints earned and comments\n\nClear presentation of ideas\n\n(coherent, logical order, grammatically correct)\n\nValue of ideas and all issues of assignment addressed\n\nConnection to readings\n\nClass engagement points will be deducted for such things as absences, late attendance/early departures, being unprepared for class and lack of contribution to class discussion.\n\nRegarding all written assignments: all papers must be typed and stapled or bound. Papers are due at the beginning of class on the day they are due. Work handed in late will be downgraded a full grade.",

      "content": "BASKETBALLMATH REVIEW COMBINED WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY\nBased on Dan Meyer's game:\nhttp://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=723\n\nFOR THE TEACHER:\n- This game involves math and playing basketball. Set up a trashcan and free-\nthrow line and give students crumpled paper or balls with which to take bonus\nshots.\n- Students play in teams of two. A good pairing could be:\n- one student who works hard and is motivated to play a game for review\n- one student who is not motivated by the idea of review, but will get excited\nfor sports\n- Present a problem to the students.\n- The first student to stand gives their answer:\n- If it's right, that team gets one point and then gets to take two shots in the\ntrashcan to gain a bonus point (1 bonus max per turn).\n- If it's wrong, they sit and rework the problem. Wait for another student to\nstand with an answer.\n\nFOR THE TEACHER:\n- Option: Do not allow a team to answer twice in a row. Maybe let them take\ntheir shots while the rest of the class starts on the next problem.\n- Option: Have all students work out every problem and turn in their solutions at\nthe end. This does not need to be graded, but it keeps the students\naccountable.\n- Option: set up multiple hoops so students do not have to move very far in the\nroom.\n\nFOR THE STUDENTS:\n- You will be paired up with a classmate to be a team for this game.\n- When the teacher presents a problem, work it out on paper.\n- When you have an answer, stand up and give it when you are called on:\n- If you get it right, your team gets a point and then gets to take two shots\ninto the trashcan hoop to try to gain a bonus point (1 bonus max per turn).\n- If you are wrong, sit back down and try again. You may have a chance to\nstand up and answer again.\n\nMATH PROBLEMS:\n- Use practice problems from a textbook or homework packet.\n- Use problems from an old version of a test or quiz\n- Find problems online, such as in Dan Meyer's Algebra curriculum on his blog\n(algebra.mrmeyer.com)\n\nPROS AND CONS:\n- Pros:\n- This game is exciting in that it involves physical activity\n- This game works well for lots of problems involving solving for x: the\nproblems take a little bit of time, but have simple answers.\n- Encourages unmotivated students to pay attention because they may be\npaired with a teammate who is motivated, and they may get to take shots.\n\n- Cons:\n- Without time limits and a clear understanding of the rules, the basketball\npart of this game can get out of hand.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n11.131 Educational Theory and Practice III\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The beautiful connection that allows this concept to aid in the solving of\nnumerous types of problems is the fact that uP,\" the point of intersection of the terminal\nside of an angle t with the unit circle has coordinates (cose, sine). They need to drop a\nperpendicular line to the x- and y-axes to find the trigonometric ratios of what I call\nuexotic\" angles that are otherwise intimidating to find trigonometric ratios of.\nMy precalculus students have mentioned to me their desire for hands-on learning\nduring class. While I have managed to pull off a few hands-on activities over the course of\nmy practicum, I did so with difficulty, sensing a lack of resources especially because there\nwas no projector to attach a computer to in my classroom. Consequently, providing a\nhands-on learning experience was expensive in terms of my time. I had to get creative. With\nMr. Unit Circle, however, I envision a class of precalculus students will come in and have an\ninteractive hands-on piece to every lesson they attend that involves trigonometry and the\nunit circle because the apparatus integrates so well with the curriculum. Making learning\nhands-on should no longer be expensive on the teacher; on the contrary, it will only be\nnatural to incorporate it into the lesson.\nMy culminating project this year had two parts. First, I will describe the design and\nconstruction of the apparatus: it is in the shape of a circle with appropriate labels of\nterminal sides overlaid onto a coordinate plane. It has a hand like the hand of a clock at the\ncenter of the circle. This hand is free to rotate about the center and is long enough to be\nbent into the perpendicular line segment that is dropped to the x- or y- axis to form a right\n\ntriangle. It is meant to be created by the students at the beginning of the trigonometry unit\nand can be easily incorporated into lessons and even assessments, both formative and\nsummative. Students can conveniently raise it up and show their teacher their work during\na lesson.\nThe second part of the culminating project is the accompanying instruction sheet\nwith clear, easy-to-follow directions and diagrams so that students and teachers can make\nthe apparatus themselves at the introduction of the trigonometry unit. This adds a personal\ntouch to the apparatuses as students can customize them to their own liking. Since they will\nuse them throughout several months, having hand-made their unit circles will make the\nstudents more likely to appreciate them. Please continue to the next section to see the basic\nstructure of the unit circle apparatus as well as the directions handout.\n\nC')\n><\nL1)\nII\n'<t\n<: 1-0\n<0\nUnit Circle Structure\nCoordinate plane: jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680/Simmons/Assignment%2010/image8.gif\nUnit Circle: www.flickr.com/photos/26661581@N07/2499249823/in/photostream\n\nMr. Unit Circle Directions Sheet\nMaterials\n1.

Now you are free to rotate the wire around to your heart's desire and adjust the\nbending accordingly.\n7. Remember,\n\nResearch Component: Literature\nMr. Unit Circle is a handheld tool about the size of a book that allows students to\nswing a hand around a pivot point in the middle of a circle overlaid onto a coordinate plane\nsystem. It is intended to help students visualize the multiple relationships that exist\nbetween angles on the unit circle and lengths on the coordinate plane. The main purpose\nfor its creation and implementation is facilitating the existence of an interactive component\nto every trigonometry-related lesson, of which there are many in a typical precalculus\ncourse.\nViewing its effects on student learning from an educational theorist's lens, having a\nhands-on tool that is in use for a long duration of the lesson is an excellent thing. A look at\nFigure 6.1 in The Skilllul Teacher shows a beautifully illustrated way of thinking about time\nallocation in a school setting. The diagram reads, from outside to inside, utime in school,\nallocated time, teacher instructional time, student engaged time, academic learning time,\ninteractive instructional time\" (Saphier 51) to describe the classification of how a student\nspends his/her time on a given day. When Mr. Unit Circle is used appropriately, what would\notherwise be simply uteacher instructional time\" immediately transforms into uinteractive\ninstructional time.\" This is because instruction will become inherently interactive in nature.\nAs stated in the book, uwhen it comes to this category, research findings have indicated the\nmore, the better\" (Saphier 56).\nWhat does it mean for a teacher to use this tool appropriately? It means the teacher\nshould incorporate her Mr. Unit Circle (preferably an enlarged, more visible version) in her\nexplanation of topics and immediately ask the students to reciprocate and display their\nown Unit Circles to her. This would require nothing more than the lifting of an arm from\n\neach student, and suddenly the teacher is able to gauge student understanding in a\nformative way. As discussed in Chapter 19 of The Skilllul Teacher, this type of assessment\ncan be used uto continually gather data about how well students are understanding during\ninstruction\" (Saphier 431). Chapter 7 of the same book discusses routines in the classroom,\nand Mr. Unit Circle should be an effective way to weave these two concepts together.\nRoutines uare valuable ways of organizing and managing a class,\" yet another important\nfunction of this tool (Saphier 69).\nDiscussion of the field research in terms of implementation and comments from\nprecalculus students as well as feedback and comments from precalculus teachers can be\nfound in the last section of this document.\nResources\nSaphier, Jon, and Robert R. Gower. The Skilllul Teacher: Building Your Teaching Skills. Acton, MA: Research for\nBetter Teaching, 1997. Print.\n\nExisting Resources\nThe activity on unit circles on Khan Academy\n(http://www.khanacademy.org/exercise/unit circle) is almost a digital version of what I\nenvision Mr. Unit Circle to be. The specifics of what students will be able to do are a little\ndifferent, but the gist is the same. Therefore, I think that the Khan Academy activity should\nbe introduced immediately before the students begin building unit circles of their own.\nBecause my mentor teacher's classroom is not equipped with a computer projector, this\ncould be left as a homework assignment. The need for having the tangible unit circles, then,\nis even more evident. They are a way for precalculus classes to overcome the challenges of\nnot having a computer projector accessible during class. With the accompaniment of having\nseen the computer animation before, interacting with and using the unit circle should\nprovoke memories of the notions the Khan Academy activity beautifully illustrates.\nIn terms of graphics, I used images from the following two locations and then edited\nCoordinate plane:\njwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680/Simmons/Assignment%2010/image8.gif\nUnit Circle:\nwww.flickr.com/photos/26661581@N07/2499249823/in/photostream\nthem and combined them on my own to form the unit circle shown above.\n\nField Research\nThe most important research I did was actually observing precalculus students\nmaking and interacting with the apparatuses. I visited the class I taught during my\npracticum and handed out the materials and the instruction sheet to the students. I told\nthem I would not explain and that instead I wanted them to try to construct the unit circles\non their own. They could raise their hands if they had questions, of course. The students\ncertainly gave valuable feedback. For example, at the time, my idea was to use paperclips as\nthe wires necessary for the making of the hand. Most questions were about how to bend\nthe paper clip well enough or in the right enough shape to make it work. After dealing with\nseveral unit circles and breaking paperclips, I realized that more flexible wire or pipe\ncleaners were definitely preferable. This change is reflected in the current directions\nhandout above. Some clarification was needed for one of my students about the wording of\nstep 4 in the instructions, so I changed the handout to reflect that as well.\nMrs. S and Mr. D are two precalculus teachers whom I interviewed about my\napparatus. They both provided valuable input. Namely, Mrs. S recommended that the unit\ncircle not have all twelve of the usual angles labeled; instead, it would be a better cognitive\nexercise every time a student used the unit circle if he/she had to make connections and\nfigure out for him/herself what the angles larger than '/2 were. She also recommended\nhaving the degree-equivalent measures available so students could quantify those visually.\nAfter showing my idea to Mr. D, he asked me if he could use it for his precalculus\nclasses. I was thrilled! I of course gave him copies of the handouts as well as some of the\nmaterials needed and asked him what he thought made it a successful tool. He said that\nwith it, uYou can see coterminal angles really easily\" and went on to say that this was\n\nsomething his students struggled with. He mentioned that especially if students hold a\nstraight edge up to the diagram, uit will be very easy for them to see that the first and\nsecond quadrant have the same sine [and] the second and third quadrant have the same\ncosine,\" for example. He also said, uI think it will be very useful.they could see the notions\nof smaller things like why the inverse of sine goes from - '/2 to '/2\" and the notions of\ncontinuity.\nMr. D summed up beautifully what this apparatus does. He said, uIt renders all those\nthings more clear because kids can manipulate it and interact with it and that's always a big\nadvantage.\" He continued, uIf you can pull on it and see it change, then you can start\ninferring how your action causes that change whereas that understand has to be built into\nany purely intellectual model, and if it's not, then their model is usually wrong and there is\nsome sort of misconception.\"\nFinally, it is important to assess the impact on student learning. After the student in\nmy precalculus class constructed the apparatus, I demonstrated how it can be used to find\nthe cosine of '/3 and then asked them to find the sine of '/6. The result was reactions\nlike, uI never thought of it like that!\" I was pleased to have shown my students a new way of\nthinking about angles, and I look forward to receiving feedback from Mrs. S and Mr. D next\nyear when they implement it in their precalculus classrooms from the beginning of the\ntrigonometry unit.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n11.131 Educational Theory and Practice III\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
