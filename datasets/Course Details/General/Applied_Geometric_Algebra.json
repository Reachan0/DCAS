  "course_description": "László Tisza was Professor of Physics Emeritus at MIT, where he began teaching in 1941. This online publication is a reproduction the original lecture notes for the course “Applied Geometric Algebra” taught by Professor Tisza in the Spring of 1976.\nOver the last 100 years, the mathematical tools employed by physicists have expanded considerably, from differential calculus, vector algebra and geometry, to advanced linear algebra, tensors, Hilbert space, spinors, Group theory and many others. These sophisticated tools provide powerful machinery for describing the physical world, however, their physical interpretation is often not intuitive. These course notes represent Prof. Tisza’s attempt at bringing conceptual clarity and unity to the application and interpretation of these advanced mathematical tools. In particular, there is an emphasis on the unifying role that Group theory plays in classical, relativistic, and quantum physics. Prof. Tisza revisits many elementary problems with an advanced treatment in order to help develop the geometrical intuition for the algebraic machinery that may carry over to more advanced problems.\nThe lecture notes came to MIT OpenCourseWare by way of Samuel Gasster, ‘77 (Course 18), who had taken the course and kept a copy of the lecture notes for his own reference. He dedicated dozens of hours of his own time to convert the typewritten notes into LaTeX files and then publication-ready PDFs. You can read about his motivation for wanting to see these notes published in his Preface. Professor Tisza kindly gave his permission to make these notes available on MIT OpenCourseWare.",

As such they were clearly a work in progress, but this also provided for a very engaging\ncourse. My original notes listed a preliminary outline that included seven chapters, but only notes\nfor the first four were provide in the Spring 1976. (If any former students have additional material\nplease contact the MIT OCW office.)\nProf. Tisza has kindly given his permission to convert these notes to LATEX and make a PDF version\navailable on the MIT OCW site. I have tried to reproduce these notes a faithly as possible from\nmy original copy, faded mimeographed version. Where there were obvious typographical errors or\nomissions I have made corrections, otherwise no alterations were made to the text or mathematics.\nI have renumbered the sections an equations to be consistent with modern LATEX typesetting. I\naccept all responsibilty for transcription errors and if other errors are discovered please contact me\nthrough MIT OCW office.\nMy motivation for making these notes available to a wide audience is three fold. First is the fact\nthat even after more than 32 years these notes still provide a unique view into the mathematical\ndescription of the physical world. Secondly, they illustrate the wonderful and engaging teaching\nstyle of Prof. Tisza that provided the students insight into the creative process of \"doing\" Physics.\nFinally, this is a small way to honor Prof. Tisza, who celebrated his 101th birthday this year, for\nbeing such a wonderful and engaging instructor.\nI would like to acknowledge several people who assisted in the process of bring these notes to\nMIT OCW. Prof. William Thacker, Department of Physics, Saint Louis University, who was a\nstudent of Prof. Tisza, provided his copy of the problem assignments included in these notes. Prof.\nEdmund Bertschinger Department Head, and Prof. Peter Fisher, of the MIT Physics Department\nfor supporting and faciliting this effort, and finally Elizabeth Derienzo of OCW.\nFinally my thanks to Prof. Tisza for teaching this course.\nSamuel Gasster, '77 (Course 18)\nPacific Palisades, CA\nNovember 2008\nii\n\niii\n\nContents\nPreface\nii\n1 Introduction\n2 Algebraic Preliminaries\n2.1\nGroups . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.1.1\nCriterion for Subgroups . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.1.2\nCyclic Groups . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.1.3\nCosets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.1.4\nConjugate Elements and Classes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.2 The geometry of the three-dimensional rotation group.

The interplay of these elements has undergone a\nconsiderable change since the turn of the century.\nIn classical physics, analysis, in particular differential equations, plays a central role. This formal\nism is supplemented most harmoniously by Gibbsian vector algebra and calculus to account for\nthe. spatial, geometric properties of particles and fields.\nFew theorists have labored as patiently as Gibbs to establish the simplest possible formalism to\nmeet a particular need. His success can be assessed by the fact that -- almost a century later -- his\ncalculus, in the original notation, is in universal use. However, once full advantage has been taken\nof all simplifications permitted in the classical theory, there did not remain the reserve capacity\nto deal with quantum mechanics and relativity. The gap in the classical algebraic framework was\nsupplemented by Minkowski tensors and Hilbert vectors, matrix algebras, spinors, Lie groups and\na host of other constructs.\nUnfortunately, the advantages derived from the increased power and sophistication of the new\nalgebraic equipment are marred by side effects. There is a proliferation of overlapping techniques\nwith too little standardization.\nAlso, while the algebras maintain a vaguely geometrical character, the \"spaces\" referred to are\nmathematical abstractions with but scant appeal to ordinary spatial intuition.\nThese features are natural consequences of rapid growth which can be remedied by consolidation\nand streamlining; the problem is to adapt the Gibbsian principle of economy to more demanding\nconditions.\nThis course is a progress report on such a project. Our emphasis on formalism does not mean\nneglect of conceptual problems. In fact, the most rewarding aspect of our consolidation is the\nresulting conceptual clarity.\nThe central idea of the present approach is that group theory provides us with a flexible and com\nprehensive framework to describe and classify fundamental physical processes. It is hardly neces\nsary to argue that this method is indeed important in modern physics, yet its potentialities are still\nfar from exhausted. This may stem from the tendency to resort to group theory only for difficult\nproblems when other methods fail, or become too cumbersome. As a result, the discussions tend\nto be complicated and abstract.\nThe distinctive feature of the present method is to start with elementary problems, but treat them\nfrom an advanced view point, and to reconcile intuitive interpretation with a smooth transition to\ndeeper problems. By focusing on group theory from the outset, we can make full use of its unifying\npower.\nAs mentioned above, this is a report on work in progress. Although we shall confine ourselves to\nproblems that fall within the scope of the \"consolidated\" theory, we shall be in a position to discuss\nsome of the conceptual problems of quantum mechanics.\n\n2 Algebraic Preliminaries\n2.1 Groups 1\nWhen group theory was introduced into the formalism of quantum mechanics in the late 1920's to\nsolve abstruse spectroscopic problems, it was considered to be the hardest and the most unwelcome\nbranch of mathematical physics. Since that time group theory has been simplified and popularized\nand it is widely practiced in many branches of physics, although this practice is still limited mostly\nto difficult problems where other methods fail.\nIn contrast, I wish to emphasize that group theory has also simple aspects which prove to be\neminently useful for the systematic presentation of the material of this course.\nPostponing for a while the precise definition,- we state somewhat loosely that we call a set of ele\nments a group if it is closed with respect to a single binary operation usually called multiplication.\nThis multiplication is, in general not to be taken in the common sense of the word, and need not\nMbe commutative. It is, however, associative and invertible.\nThe most common interpretation of such an operation is a transformation. Say, the translations\nand rotations of Euclidean space; the transformations that maintain the symmetry of an object such\nas a cube or a sphere. The transformations that connect the findings of different inertial observers\nwith each other.\nWith some training we recognize groups anywhere we look. Thus we can consider the group of\ndisplacement of a rigid body, and also any particular subset of these displacements' that arise in\nthe course of a particular motion.\nWe shall see indeed, that group theory provides a terminology that is invaluable for the precise\nand intuitive discussion of the most elementary and fundamental principles of physics. As to the\ndiscussion of specific problems we shall concentrate on those that can be adequately handled by\nstretching the elementary methods, and we shall not invoke advanced group theoretical results.\nTherefore we turn now to a brief outline of the principal definitions and theorems that we shall\nneed in the sequel.\nLet us consider a set of elements A, B, C, . . . and a binary operation that is traditionally called\n\"multiplication\". We refer to this set as a group G if the following requirements are satisfied.\n1. For any ordered pair, A, B there is a product AB = C. The set is closed with respect to\nmultiplication.\n2. The associative law holds: (AB)C = A(BC).\n3. There is a unit element E ∈G such that EA = AE = A for all A ∈G.\n1This outline serves mainly to delimit the extent of abstract group theory to be used later. Supplementary reading\nis recommended. See for instance [Tin64, Wig59, BM41].\n\n4. For each element A there is an inverse A-1 with A-1A = AA-1 = E.\nThe multiplication need not be commutative. If it is, the group is called Abelian.\nThe number of elements in G is called the order of the group. This may be finite or infinite,\ndenumerable or continuous.\nIf a subset of G satisfies the group postulates, it is called a subgroup.\n2.1.1 Criterion for Subgroups\nIf a subset of the elements of a group of finite order G is closed under multiplication, then it is a\nsubgroup of G.\nProve that the group postulates are satisfied. Discuss the case of groups of infinite order.\nIn order to explain the use of these concepts we list a few examples of sets chosen from various\nbranches of mathematics of interest in physics, for which the group postulates are valid.\nExamples\n1. The set of integers (positive, negative and zero) is an Abelian group of infinite order where\nthe common addition plays the role of multiplication. Zero serves as the unit and the inverse\nof a is -a.\n2. The set of permutations of n objects, called also the symmetric group S(n), is of order n!. It\nis non-Abelian for n > 2.\n3. The infinite set of n × n matrices with non-vanishing determinants. The operation is matrix\nmultiplication; it is in general non-commutative.\n4. The set of covering operations of a symmetrical object such as a rectangular prism (four\ngroup), a regular triangle, tetrahedron, a cube or a sphere, to mention only a few important\ncases. Expressing the symmetry of an object, they are called symmetry groups. Multipli\ncation of two elements means that the corresponding operations are carried out in a definite\nsequence. Except for the first case, these groups are non- Abelian.\nThe concrete definitions given above specify the multiplication rule for each group. For finite\ngroups the results are conveniently represented in multiplication tables, from which one extracts the\nentire group structure. One recognizes for instance that some of the groups of covering operations\nlisted under (4) are subgroups of others.\nIt is easy to prove the rearrangement theorem: In the multiplication table each column or row\ncontains each element once and only once. This theorem is very helpful in setting up multiplication\ntables. (Helps to spot errors!)\n\n2.1.2 Cyclic Groups\nFor an arbitrary element A of a finite G form the sequence: A, A2, A3 ..., let the numbers of distinct\nelements in the sequence be p. It is easy to show that Ap = E. The sequence\nA, A2, . . . , Ap = E\n(2.1.1)\nis called the period of A; p is the order of A. The period is an Abelian group, a subgroup of G. It\nmay be identical to it, in which case G is called a cyclic group.\nCorollary: Since periods are subgroups, the order of each element is a divisor of the order of the\ngroup.\n2.1.3 Cosets\nLet H be a subgroup of G with elements E, H2, ...Hh; the set of elements\nEA, H2A, . . . , HhA\n(2.1.2)\nis called a right coset HA provided A is not in H. It is easily shown that G can be decomposed as\nG = HE + HA2 + HAh\n(2.1.3)\ninto distinct cosets, each of which contains h elements. Hence the order g of the group is\ng = hk and h = g/k.\n(2.1.4)\nThus we got the important result that the order of a subgroup is a divisor of the order of the group.\nNote that the cosets are not subgroups except for HE = H which alone contains the unit element.\nSimilar results hold for left cosets.\n2.1.4 Conjugate Elements and Classes\nThe element XAX-1 is said to be an element conjugate to A. The relation of being conjugate is\nreflexive, symmetric and transitive. Therefore the elements conjugate to each other form a class.\nA single element A determines the entire class:\nEAE-1 = A, A2AA2\n-1, . . . , AnAA-\nn\n(2.1.5)\n\nHere all elements occur at least once, possibly more than once. The elements of the group can be\ndivided into classes, and every element appears in one and only one class.\nIn the case of groups of covering operations of symmetrical objects, elements of the same class\ncorrespond to rotations by the same angle around different axes that transform into each other by\nsymmetry operations.\nE.g. the three mirror planes of the regular triangle are in the same class and so are the four rotations\nby 2π/3 in a tetrahedron, or the eight rotations by ±2π/3 in a cube.\nIt happens that the elements of two groups defined in different conceptual terms are in one-one\nrelation to each other and obey the same multiplication rules. A case in point is the permutation\ngroup S(3) and the symmetry group of the regular triangle. Such groups are called isomorphic.\nRecognizing isomorphisms may lead to new insights and to practical economies in the study of\nindividual groups.\nIt is confirmed in the above examples that the term \"multiplication\" is not to be taken in a literal\nsense. What is usually meant is the performance of operations in a specified sequence, a situation\nthat arises in many practical and theoretical contexts.\nThe operations in question are often transformations in ordinary space, or in some abstract space\n(say, the configuration space of an object of interest). In order to describe these transformations in\na quantitative fashion, it is important to develop an algebraic formalism dealing with vector spaces.\nHowever, before turning to the algebraic developments in Section 2.3, we consider first a purely\ngeometric discussion of the rotation group in ordinary three-dimensional space.\n2.2 The geometry of the three-dimensional rotation group. The Rodrigues-\nHamilton theorem\nThere are three types of transformations that map the Euclidean space onto itself: translations,\nrotations and inversions. The standard notation for the proper rotation group is O+, or SO(3),\nshort for \"simple orthogonal group in three dimensions\". \"Simple\" means that the determinant\nof the transformation is +1, we have proper rotations with the exclusion of the inversion of the\ncoordinates:\nx →\n-x\ny →\n-y\n(2.2.1)\nz →\n-z\na problem to which we shall return later.\nIn contrast to the group of translations, SO(3) is non-Abelian, and its theory, beginning with the\nadequate choice of parameters is quite complicated. Nevertheless, its theory was developed to a\nremarkable degree during the 18th century by Euler.\n\nWithin classical mechanics the problem of rotation is not considered to be of fundamental impor\ntance. The Hamiltonian formalism is expressed usually in terms of point masses, which do not\nrotate. There is a built-in bias in favor of translational motion.\nThe situation is different in quantum mechanics where rotation plays a paramount role. We have\ngood reasons to give early attention to the rotation group, although at this point we have to confine\nourselves to a purely geometrical discussion that will be put later into an algebraic form.\nAccording to a well known theorem of Euler, an arbitrary displacement of a rigid body with a\nsingle fixed point can be conceived as a rotation around a fixed axis which can be specified in\nterms of the angle of rotation φ, and the unit vector uˆ along the direction of the rotational axis.\nConventionally the sense of rotation is determined by the right hand rule. Symbolically we may\nwrite R = {ˆu, φ}.\nThe first step toward describing the group structure is to provide a rule for the composition of rota\ntions with due regard for the noncommuting character of this operation. The gist of the argument\nis contained in an old theorem by Rodrigues-Hamilton 2.\nOur presentation follows that of C. L. K. Whitney [Whi68]. Consider the products\nR3 = R2R1\n(2.2.2)\nR 3 = R1R2\n(2.2.3)\nwhere R3 is the composite rotation in which R1 is followed by R2.\nFigure 2.1 represents the unit sphere and is constructed as follows: the endpoints of the vectors uˆ1,\nand uˆ2 determine a great circle, the smaller arc of which forms the base of mirror-image triangles\nhaving angles φ1/2 and φ2/2 as indicated. The endpoint of the vector uˆ1 is located by rotating uˆ1,\nby angle φ2 about uˆ2. Our claim, that the other quantities appearing on the figure are legitimately\nlabeled φ3/2, uˆ3, ˆ0\n3 is substantiated easily. Following the sequence of operations indicated in 2.2.3,\nu\nwe see that the vector called uˆ3, is first rotated by angle φ1, about uˆ1, , which takes in into uˆ3. Then\nit is rotated by angle φ2 about uˆ2, which takes it back to uˆ3. Since it is invariant, it is indeed the axis\nof the combined rotation. Furthermore, we see that the first rotation leaves uˆ1, invariant and the\nsecond rotation, that about uˆ2, carries it into uˆ1, the position it would reach if simply rotated about\nuˆ3, by the angle called φ3. Thus that angle is indeed the angle of the combined rotation. Note that\na symmetrical argument shows that uˆ 3 and φ3 are the axis and angle of the rotation P3 = R1R2.\nEquation 2.2.3 can be expressed also as\nR-1\n3 R2R1 = 1\n(2.2.4)\nwhich is interpreted as follows: rotation about uˆ1, by φ1, followed by rotation aboutuˆ2, by φ2,\nfollowed by rotation about uˆ3, by minus φ3, produces no change. This statement is the Rodrigues-\nHamilton theorem.\n2See [Whi64]\n\nFigure 2.1: Composition of the Rotations of the Sphere. α = φ1/2, β = φ2/2, γ = φ3/2.\n\n2.3 The n-dimensional vector space V (n)\nThe manipulation of directed quantities, such as velocities, accelerations, forces and the like is\nof considerable importance in classical mechanics and electrodynamics. The need to simplify the\nrather complex operations led to the development of an abstraction: the concept of a vector.\nThe precise meaning of this concept is implicit in the rules governing its manipulations. These\nrules fall into three main categories: they pertain to\n1. the addition of vectors,\n2. the multiplication of vectors by numbers (scalars),\n3. the multiplication of vectors by vectors (inner product and vector product.\nWhile the subtle problems involved in 3 will be taken up in the next chapter, we proceed here to\nshow that rules falling under 1 and 2 find their precise expression in the abstract theory of finite\ndimensional vector spaces.\nThe rules related to the addition of vectors can be concisely expressed as follows: vectors are\nelements of a set V that forms an Abelian group under the operation of addition, briefly an additive\ngroup.\nThe inverse of a vector is its negative, the zero vector plays the role of unity.\nThe numbers, or \"scalars\" mentioned under (ii) are usually taken to be the real or the complex\nnumbers. For many considerations involving vector spaces there is no need to specify which of\nthese alternatives is chosen. In fact all we need is that the scalars form a field. More explicitly, they\nare elements of a set which is closed with respect to two binary operations: addition and multi\nplication which satisfy the common commutative, associative and distributive laws; the operations\nare all invertible provided they do not involve division by zero.\nA vector space V (F ) over a field F is formally defined as a set of elements forming an additive\ngroup that can be multiplied by the elements of the field F .\nIn particular, we shall consider real and complex vector fields V (R) and V (C) respectively.\nI note in passing that the use of the field concept opens the way for a much greater variety of inter\npretations, but this is of no interest in the present context. In contrast, the fact that we have been\nconsidering \"vector\" as an undefined concept will enable us to propose in the sequel interpretations\nthat go beyond the classical one as directed quantities. Thus the above defintion is consistent with\nthe interpretation of a vector as a pair of numbers indicating the amounts of two chemical species\npresent in a mixture, or alternatively, as a point in phase space spanned by the coordinates and\nmomenta of a system of mass points.\nWe shall now summarize a number of standard results of the theory of vector spaces.\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nSuppose we have a set of non-zero vectors {~x1, ~x2, . . . , ~xn} in V which satisfy the relation\nak~xk = 0\n(2.3.1)\nk\nwhere the scalars ak ∈ F , and not all of them vanish. In this case the vectors are said to be linearly\ndependent. If, in contrast, the relation 2.3.1 implies that all ak = 0, then we say that the vectors\nare linearly independent.\nIn the former, case there is at least one vector of the. set that.can be written as a linear combination\nof the rest:\nm-1\n~xm =\nbk~xk\n(2.3.2)\nDefinition 2.1. A (linear) basis in a vector space V is a set E = {~e1, ~e2, . . . , ~en} of linearly\nindependent vectors such that every vector in V is a linear combination of the ~en. The basis is said\nto span or generate the space.\nA vector space is finite dimensional if it has a finite basis. It is a fundamental theorem of linear\nalgebra that the number of elements in any basis in a finite dimensional space is the same as in\nany other basis. This number n is the basis independent dimension of V ; we include it into the\ndesignation of the vector space: V (n, F ).\nGiven a particular basis we can express any ~x ∈ V as a linear combination\nn\n~x =\nx k~ek\n(2.3.3)\nwhere the coordinates xk are uniquely determined by E. The xk~ek (k = l, 2, . . . , n) are called\nthe components of ~x. The use of superscripts is to suggest a contrast between the transformation\nproperties of coordinates and basis to be derived shortly.\nUsing bases, called also coordinate systems, or frames is convenient for handling vectors -- thus\naddition performed by adding coordinates. However, the choice of a particular basis introduces an\nelement of arbitrariness into the formalism and this calls for countermeasures.\nSuppose we introduce a new basis by means of a nonsingular linear transformation:\nSk\n~ei =\ni ~ek\n(2.3.4)\nk\nwhere the matrix of the transformation has a nonvanishing determinant\n|Sk| 6= 0\n(2.3.5)\ni\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX X\n\nX\nensuring that the ~e0\ni form a linearly independent set, i.e., an acceptable basis. Within the context of\nthe linear theory this is the most general transformation we have to consider 3.\nWe ensure the equivalence of the different bases by requiring that\n~x =\nx k~ek =\nx i0~ei\n(2.3.6)\nInserting Equation 2.3.4 into Equation 2.3.6 we get\ni0\nSk\n~x =\nx\ni ~ek\ni0Sk\n=\nx\ni\n~ek\n(2.3.7)\nand hence in conjunction with Equation 2.3.5\nx k =\nSi\nk x i0\n(2.3.8)\nNote the characteristic \"turning around\" of the indices as we pass from Equation 2.3.4 to Equa\ntion 2.3.8 with a simultaneous interchange of the roles of the old and the new frame 4. The un\nderlying reason can be better appreciated if the foregoing calculation is carried out in symbolic\nform.\nLet us write the coordinates and the basis vectors as n × 1 column matrices\n⎛\n⎞\n⎛\n⎞\nx1\n~e1\n⎜ . ⎟\n⎜ . ⎟\nX = ⎝ .. ⎠\nE = ⎝ . ⎠\n(2.3.9)\n.\nk\nx\n~ek\nEquation 2.3.6 appears then as a matrix product\n~x = XT E = XT S-1SE = X0T E0\n(2.3.10)\nwhere the superscript stands for \"transpose.\"\nWe ensure consistency by setting\nE0 = SE\n(2.3.11)\n0T\nXT S-1\nX\n=\n(2.3.12)\nX\n0 = S-1T X\n(2.3.13)\nThus we arrive in a lucid fashion at the results contained in Equations 2.3.4 and 2.3.8. We see that\nthe \"objective\" or \"invariant\" representations of vectors are based on the procedure of transforming\nbases and coordinates in what is called a contragredient way.\n3These transformations form the general linear group GL(n, R), or GL(n, C)\n4See [Hal58], p. 66\n\nThe vector ~x itself is sometimes called a contravariant vector, to be distinguished by its transfor\nmation properties from covariant vectors to be introduced later.\nThere is a further point to be noted in connection with the factorization of a vector into basis and\ncoordinates.\nThe vectors we will be dealing with have usually a dimention such as length, velocity, momentum,\nforce and the like. It is important, in such cases, that the dimension be absorbed in the basis vectors\n~ek. In contrast, the coordinates xk are elements of the field F , the products of which are still in F ,\nthey are simply numbers. It is not surprising that the multiplication of vectors with other vectors\nconstitutes a subtle problem. Vector spaces in which there is provision for such an operation are\ncalled algebras; they deserve a careful examination.\nIt should be finally pointed out that there are interesting cases in which vectors have a dimen\nsionless character. They can be built up from the elements of the field F , which are arranged as\nn-tuples, or as m × n matrices.\nThe n × n case is particularly interesting, because matrix multiplication makes these vector spaces\ninto algebras in the sense just defined.\n2.4 How to multiply vectors? Heuristic considerations\nIn evaluating the various methods of multiplying vectors with vectors, we start with a critical\nanalysis of the procedure of elementary vector calculus based on the joint use of the inner or\nscalar product and the vector product.\nThe first of these is readily generalized to V (n, R), and we refer to the literature for further detail.\nIn contrast, the vector product is tied to three dimensions, and in order to generalize it, we have to\nrecognize that it is commonly used in two contexts, to perform entirely different functions.\nFirst to act as a rotation operator, to provide the increment δ~a of a vector ~a owing to a rotation by\nan angle δθ around an axis nˆ:\nδ~a = δθnˆ × ~a\n(2.4.1)\nHere δθnˆ is a dimensionless operator that transforms a vector into another vector in the same space.\nSecond, to provide an \"area\", the dimension of which is the product of the dimension of the factors.\nIn addition to the geometrical case, we have also such constructs as the angular momentum\nL~ = ~r × ~p\n(2.4.2)\nThe product is here \"exterior\" to tha original vector space.\nThere is an interesting story behind this double role of the vector product. Gibbs' vector algebra\narose out of the attempt of reconciling and simplifying two ingenious, but complicated geometric\nalgebras which were advanced almost simultaneously in the 1840's. Sir William Rowan Hamilton's\n\ntheory of quaternions is adapted to problems of rotation in three- and four-dimensional spaces,\nwhereas Hermann Grassman's Ausdehnungslehre (Theory of Extensions) deals with volumes in\nspaces of an arbitrary number of dimensions. The dichotomy corresponds to that of Equations 2.4.1\nand 2.4.2.\nThe complementary character of the two calculi was not recognized at the time, and the adherents\nof the two methods were in fierce competition. Gibbs found his way out of the difficulty by\nremoving all complicated and controversial elements from both calculi and by reducing them to\ntheir common core. The result is our well known elementary vector calculus with its dual-purpose\nvector product which seemed adequate for three-dimensional/space 5.\nIronically, the Gibbsian calculus became widely accepted at a time when the merit of Hamilton's\nfour-dimensional rotations was being vindicated in the context of the Einstein-Minkowski four-\ndimensional world.\nAlthough it is possible to adapt quaternions to deal with the Lorentz group, it is more practical\nto use instead the algebra of complex two-by-two matrices, the so-called Pauli algebra, and the\ncomplex vectors (spinors) on which these matrices operate. These methods are descendents of\nquaternion algebra, but they are more general, and more in line with quantum mechanical tech\nniques. We shall turn to their development in the next Chapter.\nIn recent years, also some of Grassmann's ideas have been revived and the exterior calculus is now\na standard technique of differential geometry (differential forms, calculus of manifolds). These\nmatters are relevant to the geometry of phase space, and we shall discuss them later on.\n2.5 A Short Survey of Linear Groups\nThe linear vector space V (n, F ) provides us with the opportunity to define a number of linear\ngroups which we shall use in the sequel.\nWe start with the group of nonsingular linear transformations defined by Equations 2.3.4 and 2.3.5\nof Section 2.3 and designated as GL(n, R), for \"general linear group over the field F.\" If the matri\nces are required to have unit determinants, they are called unimodular, and the group is SL(n, F ),\nfor simple linear group.\nLet us consider now the group GL(n, R) over the real field, and assume that an inner product is\ndefined:\nx1y1 + x2y2 + . . . + xnyn = XT Y\n(2.5.1)\nTransformations which leave this form invariant are called orthogonal. By using Equations 2.3.10\nand 2.3.12 of Sectionsec:vec-space, we see that they satisfy the condition\nOT O = I\n(2.5.2)\n5The new vector calculus was not received with undivided enthusiasm. Professor Tait referred to it as \". . . a sort\nof hermaphrodite monster compounded of the notations of Hamilton and Grassmann.\" Quoted by Gibbs in Collected\nWorks, Volume II, Part II, p 155.\n\nwhere I is the unit matrix. The corresponding group is called O(n).\nIt follows from 2.5.2 that the determinant of O is detO = |O| = ±1. The matrices with positive\ndeterminant form a subgroup SO(n).\nThe orthogonal groups have an important geometrical meaning, they leave the so-called metric\nproperties, lengths and angles invariant. The group SO(n) corresponds to pure rotations, these\noperations can be continuously connected with the identity. In contrast, transformations with neg\native determinants involve the inversion, and hence mirrorings and improper rotations. The set of\nmatrices with |O| = -1, does not form a group, since it does not contain the unit element.\nThe geometrical interpretation of GL(n, R) is not explained as easily. Instead of metric Euclidean\ngeometry, we arrive at the less familiar affine geometry, the practical applications of which are not\nso direct. We shall return to these questions in Chapter VII6. However, in the next section we shall\nshow that the geometrical interpretation of the group of unimodular transformations SL(n, R) is\nto leave volume invariant.\nWe turn now to an extension of the concept of metric geometry. We note first that instead of re\nquiring the invariance of the expression 2.5.1, we could have selected an arbitrary positive definite\nquadratic form in order to establish a metric. However, a proper choice of basis in V(n, R) leads\nus back to Equation 2.5.1.\nIf the invariant quadratic form is indefinite, it reduces to the canonical form\nx1 + x2 + . . . + x - xk+1 - . . . - x\n(2.5.3)\nk\nk+l\nThe corresponding group of invariance is pseudo-orthogonal denoted as O(k, l).\nIn this category the Lorentz group SO(3, 1) is of fundamental physical interest. At this point\nwe accept this as a fact, and a sufficient incentive for us to examine the mathematical structure of\nSO(3, 1) in Section 3. However, subsequently, in Section 4, we shall review the physical principles\nwhich are responsible for the prominent role of this group. The nature of the mathematical study\ncan be succinctly explained as follows.\nThe general n × n matrix over the real field contains n2 independent parameters. The condition\n2.5.2 cuts down this number to n(n - l)/2. For n = 3 the number of parameters is cut down from\nnine to three, for n = 4 from sixteen to six. The parameter count is the same for SO(3, 1) as\nfor SO(4). One of the practical problems involved in the applications of these groups is to avoid\ndealing with the redundant variables, and to choose such independent parameters that can be easily\nidentified with geometrically and physically relevant quantities. This is the problem discussed in\nSection 3. We note that SO(3) is a subgroup of the Lorentz group, and the two groups are best\nhandled within the same framework.\nIt will turn out that the proper parametrization can be best attained in terms of auxiliary vector\nspaces defined over the complex field. Therefore we conclude our list of groups by adding the\nunitary groups.\n6This chapter was not included in the Spring 1976 notes - Editor.\n\nX\nLet us consider the group GL(n, C) and impose an invariant Hermitian form\n∗\naikxixk\nthat can be brought to the canonical form\n∗\n∗\n∗\nx1x1 + x2x2 + . . . + xnxn = X+X\n(2.5.4)\nwhere X+ = X∗T is the Hermitian adjoint of X and the star stands for the conjugate complex.\nExpression 2.5.4 is invariant under transformations by matrices that satisfy the condition\nU +U = I\n(2.5.5)\nThese matrices are called unitary, they form the unitary group U(n). Their determinants have the\nabsolute value one. If the determinant is equal to one, the unitary matrices are also, unimodular,\nwe have the simple unitary group SU(n).\n2.6 The unimodular group SL(n, R) and the invariance of volume\nIt is well known that the volume of a parallelepiped spanned by linearly independent vectors is\ngiven by the determinant of the vector components. It is evident therefore that a transformation\nwith a unimodular matrix leaves this expression for the volume invariant.\nYet the situation has some subtle aspects which call for a closer examination. Although the calcu\nlation of volume and area is among the standard procedures of geometry, this is usually carried out\nin metric spaces, in which length and angle have their well known Euclidean meaning. However,\nthis is a too restrictive assumption, and the determinantal formula can be justified also within affine\ngeometry without using metric concepts7.\nSince we shall repeatedly encounter such situations, we briefly explain the underlying idea for the\ncase of areas in a two-dimensional vector space V(2, R).\nWe advance two postulates:\n1. Area is an additive quantity: the area of a figure is equal to the sum of the areas of its parts.\n2. Translationally congruent figures have equal areas.\n(The point is that Euclidean congruence'involves also rotational congruence, which is not available\nto us because of the absence of metric.)\nWe proceed now in successive steps as shown in Figure 2.2.\n7See [Cox69], Section 13.4 Equiaffinites; [VY18], Vol. II, p. 105, 291; [Cur68], Chapter 5.\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 2.2: Translational congruence and equal area.\n\nConsider at first the vectors\n1~\n~x = x e1\n2~\n~y = y e2\nwhere the coordinates are integers (Figure 2.2a). The area relative to the unit cell is obtained\nthrough simple counting as x1y2 . The same result can be justified for any real values for the\ncoordinates by subdivision and a limiting process.\nWe are permitted to write this result in determinantal form:\nx y =\nx\ny2\n(2.6.1)\nIf the vectors\n1~\n2~\n~x = x e1 + x e2\n1~\n2~\n~y = y e1 + y e2\ndo not coincide with the coordinate axes, the coincidence can be achieved in no more than two\nsteps (Figures 2.2b and 2.2c) using the translational congruence of the parallelograms (0123)\n(012'3') (012\"3').\nBy an elementary geometrical argument one concludes from here that the area spanned by ~x and ~y\nis equal to the area spanned by eˆ1 and eˆ2 multiplied by the determinant\nx\nx\ny\ny\n(2.6.2)\nThis result can be justified also in a more elegant way: The geometrical operations in figures b and\nc consist of adding the multiple of the vector ~y to the vector ~x, or adding the multiple of the second\nrow of the determinant to the first row, and we know that such operations leave the value of the\ndeterminant unchanged.\nThe connection between determinant and area can be generalized to three and more dimensions,\nalthough the direct geometric argument would become increasingly cumbersome.\nThis defect will be remedied most effectively in terms of the Grassmann algebra that will be de\nveloped in Chapter VII8.\n2.7 On \"alias\" and \"alibi\". The Object Group\nIt is fitting to conclude this review of algebraic preliminaries by formulating a rule that is to guide\nus in connecting the group theoretical concepts with physical principles,\n8This chapter was not included in the Spring 1976 notes - Editor.\n\nOne of the concerns of physicists is to observe, identify and classify particles. Pursuing this ob\njective we should be able to tell whether we observe the same object when encountered under\ndifferent conditions in different states. Thus the identity of an object is implicitly given by the set\nof states in which we recognize it to be the same. It is plausible to consider the transformations\nwhich connect these states with each other, and to assume that they form a group. Accordingly, a\nprecise way of identifying an object is to specify an associated object group.\nThe concept of object group is extremely general, as it should be, in view of the vast range of\nsituations it is meant to cover. It is useful to consider specific situations in more detail.\nFirst, the same object may be observed by different inertial observers whose findings are connected\nby the transformations of the inertial group, to be called also the passive kinematic group. Second,\nthe space-time evolution of the object in a fixed frame of reference can be seen as generated by an\nactive kinematic group. Finally, if the object is specified in phase space, we speak of the dynamic\ngroup.\nThe fact that linear transformations in a vector space can be given a passive and an active interpre\ntation, is well known. In the mathematical literature these are sometimes designated by the colorful\nterms \"alias\" and \"alibi,\" respectively. The first means that the transformation of the basis leads to\nnew \"names\" for the same geometrical, or physical objects. The second is a mapping by which the\nobject is transformed to another \"location\" with respect to the same frame.\nThe important groups of invariance are to be classified as passive groups. Without in any way\nminimizing their importance, we shall give much attention also to the active groups. This will\nenable us to handle, within a unified group-theoretical framework, situations commonly described\nin terms of equations of motion, and also the so-called \"preparations of systems\" so important in\nquantum mechanics.\nIt is the systematic joint use of \"alibi\" and \"alias\" that characterizes the following argument.\n\n3 The Lorentz Group and the Pauli Algebra\n3.1 Introduction\nTwentieth century physics is dominated by the development of relativity and quantum mechanics,\ndisciplines centered around the universal constants c and h respectively. Historically, the emer\ngence of these constants revealed a socalled breakdown of classical concepts.\nFrom the point of view of our present knowledge, it would be evidently desirable to avoid such\nbreakdowns and formulate only principles which are correct according to our present knowledge.\nUnfortunately, no one succeeded thus far to suggest a \"correct\" postulational basis which would\nbe complete enough for the wide ranging practical needs of physics.\nThe purpose of this course is to explore a program in which we forego, or rather postpone, the\nrequirement of completeness, and consider at first only simple situations. These are described in\nterms of concepts which form the basis for the development of a precise mathematical formalism\nwith empirically verified physical implications. The continued alternation of conceptual analysis\nwith formal developments gradually extends and deepens the range of situations covered, without\naffecting consistency and empirical validity.\nAccording to the central idea of quantum mechanics all particles have undulatory properties, and\nelectromagnetic radiation has corpuscular aspects. In the quantitative development of this idea we\nhave to make a choice, whether to start with the classical wave concept and build in the corpscular\naspects, or else start with the classical concept of the point particle, endowed with a constant and\ninvariant mass, and modify these properties by means of the wave concept. Eventually, the result\ning theory should be independent of the path chosen, but the details of the construction process are\ndifferent.\nThe first alternative is apparent in Einstein's photon hypothesis9, which is closely related with his\nspecial theory of relativity10.\nIn contrast, the wealth of nonrelativistic problems within atomic, molecular and nuclear physics\nfavored the second approach which is exploited in the Bohr-Heisenberg quantum mechanics.\nThe course of the present developments is set by the decision of following up the Einsteinian\ndeparture.\n3.2 The corpuscular aspects of light\nAs a first step in carrying out the problem just stated, we start with a precise, even though schematic,\nformulation of wave kinematics.\n9See Reference[Ein05a].\n10See reference [Ein05b]. Einstein discussed the implications of relativistic and quantum effects on the theory of\nradiation in an address before the 81st assembly of the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, Salzburg, 1909\n[Ein09].\n\nWe consider first a spherical wave front\nro\n2 - ~r 2 = 0\n(3.2.1)\nwhere\nro = ct\n(3.2.2)\nand t is the time elapsed since emission to the instantaneous wave front.\nIn order to describe propagation in a definite direction, say along the unit vector kˆ, we introduce\nan appropriately chosen tangent plane corresponding to a monochromatic plane wave\nkoro - ~k · ~r = 0\n(3.2.3)\nwith\nko = ω/c\n(3.2.4)\n~k = 2π\nλ\nˆk\n(3.2.5)\nand\nko\n2 - ~k2 = 0\n(3.2.6)\nwhere the symbols have their conventional meanings.\nNext we postulate that radiation has a granular character, as it is expressed already in Definition 1 of\nNewton's Optics! However, in a more quantitative sense we state the standard quantum condition\naccording to which a quantum of light pulse with the wave vector (ko,~k) is associated with a\nfour-momentum\n(po, ~p) = ~(ko,~k)\n(3.2.7)\np 2\no - p~2 = 0\n(3.2.8)\nwith\nE\npo =\n(3.2.9)\nc\nwhere E is the energy of the light quantum, or photon.\nThe proper coordination of the two descriptions involving spherical and plane waves, presents\nproblems to which we shall return later. At this point it is sufficient to note that individual photons\nhave directional properties described by a wave vector,and a spherical wave can be considered as\nan assembly of photons emitted isotropically from a small source.\nAs the next step in our procedure we argue that the photon as a particle should be associated with\nan object group, as introduced in Sec. 1.7. Assuming with Einstein that light velocity is unaffected\nby an inertial transformation, the passive kinematic group that leaves Eq's (1) - (3) invariant is the\nLorentz group.\n\nThere are few if any principles in physics which are as thoroughly justified by their implications as\nthe principle of Lorentz invariance. Our objective is to develop these implications in a systematic\nfashion.\nIn the early days of relativity the consequences of Lorentz invariance involved mostly effects of the\norder of (v/c)2 , a quantity that is small for the velocities attainable at that time. The justification\nis much more dramatic at present when we can refer to the operation of high energy accelerators\noperating near light velocity.\nYet this is not all. Lorentz invariance has many consequences which are valid even in nonrelativistic\nphysics, but classically they require a number of independent postulates for their justification. In\nsuch cases the Lorentz group is used to achieve conceptual economy.\nIn-view of this far-reaching a posteriori verification of the constancy of light velocity, we need not\nbe unduly concerned with its a priori justification. It is nevertheless a puzzling question, and it has\ngiven rise to much speculation: what was Einstein's motivation in advancing this postulate? 11\nEinstein himself gives the following account of a paradox on which he hit at the age of sixteen12:\n\"If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity c (velocity of light in vacuum), I should\nobserve such a beam of light' as a spatially oscillatory electromagnetic field at rest.\nHowever, there seems to be no such thing, whether on the basis of experience or ac\ncording to Maxwell's equations.\"\nThe statement could be actually even sharpened: on overtaking a travelling wave, the resulting\nphenomenon would simply come to rest, rather than turn into a standing wave.\nHowever it may be, if the velocity of propagation were at all affected by the motion of the ob\nserver, it could be \"transformed away.\" Should we accept such a radical change from an inertial\ntransformation? At least in hindsight, we know that the answer is indeed no.\nNote that the essential point in the above argument is that a light quantum cannot be transformed\nto rest. This absence of a preferred rest system with respect to the photon does not exclude the\nexistence of a preferred frame defined from other considerations. Thus it has been recently sug\ngested that a preferred frame be defined by the requirement that the 3K radiation be isotropic in it\n[Wei72].\nSince Einstein and his contemporaries emphasized the absence of any preferred frame of reference,\none might have wondered whether the aforementioned radiation, or some other cosmologically\ndefined frame,might cause difficulties in the theory of relativity.\nOur formulation, based on weaker assumptions, shows that such concern is unwarranted.\n11*See Gerald Holton, Einstein, Michelson and \"Crucial\" Experiment, in Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought.\nKepler to Einstein. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1973, pp 261-352.\n\nWe observe finally, that we have considered thus far primarily wave kinematics, with no reference\nto the electrodynamic interpretation of light. This is only a tactical move. We propose to derive\nclassical electrodynamics (CED) within our scheme, rather than suppose its validity.\nProblems of angular momentum and polarization are also left for later inclusion.\nHowever, we are ready to widen our context by being more explicit with respect to the properties\nof the four-momentum.\nEq (5) provides us with a definition of the four-momentum, but only for the case of the photon,\nthat is for a particle with zero rest mass and the velocity c.\nThis relation is easily generalized to massive particles that can be brought to rest. We make use of\nthe fact that the Lorentz transformation leaves the left-hand side of Eq (5) invariant, whether or not\nit vanishes. Therefore we set\n2 2\npo - p~ · p~ = m c\n(3.2.10)\nand define the mass m of a particle as the invariant \"length\" of the four-momentum according to\nthe Minkowski metric (with c = 1).\nWe can now formulate the postulate: The four-momentum is conserved. This principle includes\nthe conservation of energy and that of the three momentum components. It is to be applied to the\ninteraction between the photon and a massive particle and also to collision processes in general.\nIn order to make use of the conservation law, we need explicit expressions for the velocity depen\ndence of the four-momentum components. These shall be obtained from the study of the Lorentz\ngroup.\n3.3 On circular and hyperbolic rotations\nWe propose to develop a unified formalism for dealing with the Lorentz group SO(3, 1) and its\nsubgroup SO(3). This program can be divided into two stages. First, consider a Lorentz transfor\nmation as a hyperbolic rotation, and exploit the analogies between circular and hyperbolic trigono\nmetric functions, and also of the corresponding exponentials. This simple idea is developed in this\nsection in terms of the subgroups SO(2) and SO(1, 1). The rest of this chapter is devoted to the\ngeneralization of these results to three spatial dimensions in terms of a matrix formalism.\nLet us consider a two-component vector in the Euclidean plane:\n~x = x1eˆ1 + x2eˆ2\n(3.3.1)\nWe are interested in the transformations that leave x1\n2 + x2\n2 invariant. Let us write\nx1\n2 + x2\n2 = (x1 + ix2) (x1 - ix2)\n(3.3.2)\n\nand set\n(x1 + ix2)0 = a(x1 + ix2)\n(3.3.3)\n(x1 - ix2)0 = a ∗ (x1 - ix2)\n(3.3.4)\nwhere the star means conjugate complex. For invariance we have\naa ∗ = 1\n(3.3.5)\nor\na = exp(-iφ) ,\na ∗ = exp(iφ)\n(3.3.6)\nFrom these formulas we easily recover the elementary trigonometric expressions. Table 3.1 sum\nmarizes the presentations of rotational transformations in terms of exponentials, trigonometric\nfunctions and algebraic irrationalities involving the slope of the axes. There is little to recommend\nthe use of the latter, however it completes the parallel with Lorentz transformations where this\nparametrization is favored by tradition.\nWe emphasize the advantages of the exponential function, mainly because it lends itself to iteration,\nwhich is apparent from the well known formula of de Moivre:\nexp(inφ) = cos(nφ) + i sin(nφ) = (cos(φ) + i sin(φ))n\n(3.3.7)\nThe same Table contains also the parametrization of the Lorentz group in one spatial variable. The\nanalogy between SO(2) and SO(1, 1) is far reaching and the Table is selfexplanatory. Yet there\nare a number of additional points which are worth making.\nThe invariance of\nx0\n2 - x3\n2 = (x0 + x3) (x0 - x3)\n(3.3.8)\nis ensured by\n(x0 + x3)0 = a(x0 + x3)\n(3.3.9)\n(x0 - x3)0 = a -1(x0 - x3)\n(3.3.10)\nfor an arbitrary a. By setting a = exp(-μ) in the Table we tacitly exclude negative values.\nAdmitting a negative value for this parameter would imply the interchange of future and past. The\nLorentz transformations which leave the direction of time invariant, are called orthochronic. Until\nfurther notice these are the only ones we shall consider.\nThe meaning of the parameter μ is apparent from the well known relation\nv\ntanh μ =\n= β\n(3.3.11)\nc\nwhere v is the velocity of the primed system Σ0 measured in Σ. Being a (non-Euclidean) measure\nof a velocity, μ is sometimes called rapidity, or velocity parameter.\n\nRotation\nLorentz Transformation\n(x1 - ix2)0 = eiφ(x1 - ix2)\n(x1 + ix2)0 = e-iφ(x1 + ix2)\nx0\n1 = x1 cos φ + x2 sin φ\nx0\n2 = -x1 sin φ + x2 cos φ\n(x0 + x3)0 = e-μ(x0 + x3)\n(x0 - x3)0 = eμ(x0 - x3)\nx0\n3 = x3 cosh μ - x0 sinh μ\nx0\n0 = -x3 sinh μ + x0 cosh μ\nx0\n1 = x1+κx2\n√\n1+κ2\nx0\n2 = κx1+x2\n√\n1+κ2\nκ = tan φ =\n\nx2\nx1\n\nx0\n2 = 0\n= -\n\nx0\nx0\n\nx2 = 0\nx0\n3 = x3-βx0\n√\n1-β2\nx0\n0 = -βx3+x0\n√\n1-β2\nβ = tanh μ =\n\nx3\nx0\n\nx0\n3 = 0\n=\n\nx0\nx0\n\nx3 = 0 ,\nx0 = ct\nX2\nx1 = tan θ\nθ0 = θ - φ\nX3\nx0 = tanh ν\nν0 = ν - μ\nTable 3.1: Summary of the rotational transformations. (The signs of the angles correspond to the\npassive interpretation.)\n\nFigure 3.1: Area in (x0, x3)-plane.\nWe shall refer to μ also as hyperbolic angle. The formal analogy with the circular angle φ\nis evident from the Table. We deepen this parallel by means of the observation that μ can be\ninterpreted as an area in the (x0, x3) plane (see Figure 3.1).\nConsider a hyperbola with the equation\nx0 2\n-\nx3 2\n= 1\n(3.3.12)\na\nb\nx0 = a cosh μ\nx3 = b sinh μ\n(3.3.13)\nThe shaded triangular area (shown in Figure 3.1) is according to Equation 2.6.2 of Section 2.6:\nx3 + dx3 x3\nx0 + dx0 x0\n= 1 (x0dx3 - x3dx0) =\n(3.3.14)\nab\nab\ncosh μ 2 - sinh μ 2 d =\ndμ\n(3.3.15)\nWe could proceed similarly for the circular angle φ and define it in terms of the area of a circular\nsector, rather than an arc. However, only the area can be generalized for the hyperbola.\nAlthough the formulas in Table 3.1 apply also to the wave vector and the four momentum.and can\nbe used in each case also according to the active interpretation, the various situations have their\nindividual features, some of which will now be surveyed.\nConsider at first a plane wave the direction of propagation of which makes an angle θ with the\ndirection x3 of the Lorentz transformation. We write the phase, Equation 3.3.11 of Section 3.2, as\n1 [(k0 + k3)(x0 - x3) + (k0 - k3)(x0 + x3)] - k1x1 - k2x2\n(3.3.16)\n\ns\nThis expression is invariant if (k0 ± k3) transforms by the same factor exp(±μ) as (x0 ± x3).\nThus we have\nk3\n= k3 cosh μ - k0 sinh μ\n(3.3.17)\nk0\n= -k3 sinh μ + k0 cosh μ\n(3.3.18)\nSince (k0,~k) is a null-vector, i.e., k has vanishing length, we set\nk3 = k0 cos θ,\nk3\n0 = k0\n0 cos θ0\n(3.3.19)\nand we obtain for the aberration and the Doppler effect:\ncos θ cosh μ - sinh μ\ncos θ - β\ncos θ0 =\n=\n(3.3.20)\ncosh μ - cos θ sinh μ\n1 - β cos θ\nand\nk0\nω0\n0 =\n0 = cosh μ - cos θ sinh μ\n(3.3.21)\nk0\nω0\nFor cos θ = 1 we have\nω0\n1 - β\n= exp(-μ) =\n(3.3.22)\nω0\n1 + β\nThus the hyperbolic angle is directly connected with the frequency scaling in the Doppler effect.\nNext, we turn to the transformation of the four-momentum of a massive particle. The new feature\nis that such a particle can be brought to rest. Let us say the particle is at rest in the frame Σ0 (rest\nframe), that moves with the velocity v3 = c tanh-1 μ in the frame Σ (lab frame). Thus v3 can be\nidentified as the particle velocity along x3.\nSolving for the momentum in Σ:\np3 = p3\n0 cosh μ + p0\n0 sinh μ\n(3.3.23)\np0 = p3\n0 sinh μ + p0\n0 cosh μ\n(3.3.24)\nwith p3\n0 = 0, p0\n0 = mc, we have\nmcβ\np3\n= mc sinh μ = p\n(3.3.25)\n1 - β2\nmc\nE\np0\n= mc cosh μ = p\n=\n1 - β2\nc\nγ = cosh μ,\nγβ = sinh μ\n(3.3.26)\n\nThus we have solved the problem posed at the end of Section 3.2.\nThe point in the preceding argument is that we achieve the transition from a state of rest of a particle\nto a state of motion, by the kinematic means of inertial transformation. Evidently, the same effect\ncan be achieved by means of acceleration due to a force, and consider this \"boost\" as an active\nLorentz transformation. Let us assume that the particle carries the charge e and is exposed to a\nconstant electric intensity E. We get from Equantion 3.3.25 for small velocities:\ndp3\ndμ\ndμ\n= mc cosh μ\n' mc\n(3.3.27)\ndt\ndt\ndt\nand this agrees with the classical equation of motion if\nmc dμ\nE =\n(3.3.28)\ne dt\nThus the electric intensity is proportional to the hyperbolic angular velocity.\nIn close analogy, a circular motion can be produced by a magnetic field:\nmc dφ\nmc\nB = -\n= -\nω\n(3.3.29)\ne dt\ne\nThis is the well known cyclotron relation.\nThe foregoing results are noteworthy for a number of reasons. They suggest a close connection\nbetween electrodynamics and the Lorentz group and indicate how the group theoretical method\nprovides us with results usually obtained by equations of motion.\nAll this brings us a step closer to our program of establishing much of physics within a group\ntheoretical framework, starting in particular with the Lorentz group. However, in order to carry out\nthis program we have to generalize our technique to three spatial dimensions. For this we have the\nchoice between two methods.\nThe first is to represent a four-vector as a 4 × 1 column matrix and operate on it by 4 × 4 matrices\ninvolving 16 real parameters among which there are ten relations (see Section 2.5).\nThe second approach is to map four-vectors on Hermitian 2 × 2 matrices\n\nP =\np0 + p3\np1 + ip2\np1 - ip2\np0 - p3\n(3.3.30)\nand represent Lorentz transformations as\nP 0 = V P V +\n(3.3.31)\nwhere V and V + are Hermitian adjoint unimodular matrices depending .just on the needed six\nparameters.\n\nWe choose the second alternative and we shall show that the mathematical parameters have the\ndesired simple physical interpretations. In particular we shall arrive at generalizations of the de\nMoivre relation, Equation 3.3.7.\nThe balance of this chapter is devoted to the mathematical theory of the 2×2 matrices with physical\napplications to electrodynamics following in Section 4.\n\n3.4 The Pauli Algebra\n3.4.1 Introduction\nLet us consider the set of all 2 × 2 matrices with complex elements. The usual definitions of ma\ntrix addition and scalar multiplication by complex numbers establish this set as a four-dimensional\nvector space over the field of complex numbers V(4, C). With ordinary matrix multiplication, the\nvector space becomes, what is called an algebra, in the technical sense explained at the end of\nSection 2.3. The nature of matrix multiplication ensures that this algebra, to be denoted A2, is as\nsociative and noncommutative, properties which are in line with the group-theoretical applications\nwe have in mind.\nThe name \"Pauli algebra\" stems, of course, from the fact that A2 was first introduced into physics\nby Pauli, to fit the electron spin into the formalism of quantum mechanics. Since that time the\napplication of this technique has spread into most branches of physics.\nFrom the point of view of mathematics, A2 is merely a special case of the algebra An of n × n\nmatrices, whereby the latter are interpreted as transformations over a vector space V(n2, C). Their\nreduction to canonical forms is a beautiful part of modern linear algebra.\nWhereas the mathematicians do not give special attention to the case n = 2, the physicists13,\ndealing with four-dimensional space-time, have every reason to do so, and it turns out to be most\nrewarding to develop procedures and proofs for the special case rather than refer to the general\nmathematical theorems. The technique for such a program has been developed some years ago14.\nThe resulting formalism is closely related to the algebra of complex quaternions, and has been\ncalled accordingly a system of hypercomplex numbers. The study of the latter goes back to Hamil\nton, but the idea has been considerably developed in recent years15. The suggestion that the matri\nces (1) are to be considered symbolically as generalizations of complex numbers which still retain\n\"number-like\" properties, is appealing, and we shall make occasional use of it. Yet it seems con\nfining to make this into the central guiding principle. The use of matrices harmonizes better with\nthe usual practice of physics and mathematics16\nIn the forthcoming systematic development of this program we shall evidently cover much ground\nthat is well known, although some of the proofs and concepts of Whitney and Tisza do not seem\nto be used elsewhere. However, the main distinctive feature of the present approach is that we do\nnot apply the formalism to physical theories assumed to be given, but develop the geometrical,\nkinematic and dynamic applications in close parallel with the building up of the formalism.\n13However, see [Ebe65].\n14[Whi68]. Also unpublished reports by Tisza and Whitney.\n15See particularly a series of papers by J. D. Edmonds: [Edm73a, Edm75, Edm74b, Edm74a, Edm73b, Edm72].\nAlso, [Jam74] for the references to the early literature.\n16For a development of the matrix method see also [Fro75].\n\nSince our discussion is meant to be self-contained and economical, we use references only spar\ningly. However, at a later stage we shall state whatever is necessary to ease the reading of the\nliterature.\n3.4.2 Basic Definitions and Procedures\nWe consider the set A2 of all 2 × 2 complex matrices\na11 a12\nA =\n(3.4.1)\na21 a22\nAlthough one can generate A2 from the basis\ne1 =\n(3.4.2)\ne2 =\n(3.4.3)\ne3 =\n(3.4.4)\ne4 =\n(3.4.5)\nin which case the matrix elements are the expansion coefficients, it is often more convenient to\ngenerate it from a basis formed by the Pauli matrices augmented by the unit matrix.\nAccordingly A2 is called the Pauli algebra. The basis matrices are\n\nσ0 = I =\n(3.4.6)\n\nσ1 =\n(3.4.7)\n\nσ2 =\ni\n-i\n(3.4.8)\n\nσ3 =\n-1\n(3.4.9)\nThe three Pauli matrices satisfy the well known multiplication rules\nσj\n2 =\n1 j = 1, 2, 3\n(3.4.10)\nσj σk = -σkσj = iσl\nj k l = 1 2 3 or an even permutation thereof\n(3.4.11)\n\nX\n\nAll of the basis matrices are Hermitian, or self-adjoint:\nσμ\n+ = σμ\nμ = 0, 1, 2, 3\n(3.4.12)\n(By convention, Roman and Greek indices will run from one to three and from zero to three,\nrespectively.)\nWe shall represent the matrix A of Equation 3.4.1 as a linear combination of the basis matrices with\nthe coefficient of σμ denoted by aμ. We shall refer to the numbers aμ as the components of the\nmatrix A. As can be inferred from the multiplication rules, Equation 3.4.11 , matrix components\nare obtained from matrix elements by means of the relation\naμ = Tr (Aσμ)\n(3.4.13)\nwhere Tr stands for trace. In detail,\na0 =\n(a11 + a22)\n(3.4.14)\na1 =\n(a12 + a21)\n(3.4.15)\na2 =\n(a12 - a21)\n(3.4.16)\na3 =\n(a11 - a22)\n(3.4.17)\nIn practical applications we shall often see that a matrix is best represented in one context by its\ncomponents, but in another by its elements. It is convenient to have full flexibility to choose at\nwill between the two. A set of four components aμ, denoted by {aμ}, will often be broken into a\ncomplex scalar a0 and a complex \"vector\"17 {a1, a2, a3} = ~a. Similarly, the basis matrices of A2\nwill be denoted by σ0 = 1 and {σ1, σ2, σ3} = ~σ. With this notation,\nA =\naμσμ = a01 + ~a · ~σ\n(3.4.18)\nμ\na0 + a3\na1 - ia2\n=\n(3.4.19)\na1 + ia2\na0 - a3\nWe associate with .each matrix the half trace and the determinant\n1 T rA = a0\n(3.4.20)\n|A| = a 2 - ~a 2\n(3.4.21)\n17The term \"vector\" here merely signifies a three-component object with which, in a formal way, one can perform\nthe dot and cross products of vector calculus. The term does not refer to the transformation properties to be taken up\nin Section 3.4.3.\n\nThe extent to which these numbers specify the properties of the matrix A, will be apparent from\nthe discussion of their invariance properties in the next two subsections. The positive square root\nof the determinant is in a way the norm of the matrix. Its nonvanishing: |A| 6\n0, is the criterion\n=\nfor A to be invertible.\nSuch matrices can be normalized to become unimodular:\nA →|A|-1/2A\n(3.4.22)\nThe case of singular matrices\n|A| = a 2 - ~a 2 = 0\n(3.4.23)\ncalls for comment. We call matrices for which |A| = 0, but A 6= 0, null-matrices. Because of their\noccurrence, A2 is not a division algebra. This is in contrast, say, with the set of real quaternions\nwhich is a division algebra, since the norm vanishes only for the vanishing quaternion.\nThe fact that null-matrices are important,stems partly from the indefinite Minkowski metric. How\never, entirely different applications will be considered later.\nWe list now some practical rules for operations in A2, presenting them in terms of matrix compo\nnents rather than the more familiar matrix elements.\nTo perform matrix multiplications we shall make use of a formula implied by the multiplication\nrules, Equantion 3.4.11:\n~\n~\na ×~\n(~a · ~σ) b · ~σ = ~a · bI + i ~\nb · ~σ\n(3.4.24)\nwhere ~a and ~b are complex vectors.\nEvidently, for any two matrices A and B\n[A, B] = AB - BA = 2i ~a ×~b · ~σ\n(3.4.25)\nThe matrices A and B commute, if and only if\n~a ×~b = 0\n(3.4.26)\nthat is, if the vector parts ~a and ~b are \"parallel\" or at least one of them vanishes.\nIn addition to the internal operations of addition and multiplication, there are external operations on\nA2 as a whole, which are analogous to complex conjugation. The latter operation is an involution,\nwhich means that (z ∗)∗ = z. Of the three involutions any two can be considered independent.\nIn A2 we have two independent involutions which can be applied jointly to yield a third:\nA → A = a0I + ~a · ~σ\n(3.4.27)\nA → A+ = a0\n∗ I + ~a ∗ · ~σ\n(3.4.28)\nA → A = a0I - ~a · ~σ\n(3.4.29)\nA +\n\n∗\n∗\nA →\n= A = a0I - ~a · ~σ\n(3.4.30)\n\nn\no\nThe matrix A+ is the Hermitian adjoint of A. Unfortunately, there is neither an agreed symbol,\nnor a term for A . Whitney called it Pauli conjugate, other terms are quaternionic conjugate or\n\nhyper-conjugate A++ (see Edwards, l.c.). Finally A is called complex reflection.\nIt is easy to verify the rules\n(AB)+ = B+A+\n(3.4.31)\n\nB\nAB\n=\nA\n(3.4.32)\n\nAB\n= BA\n(3.4.33)\nAccording to Equantion 3.4.33 the operation of complex reflection maintains the product relation in\nA2, it is an automorphism. In contrast, the Hermitian and Pauli conjugations are anti-automorphic.\nIt is noteworthy that the three operations , + , , together with the identity operator, form a group\n(the four-group, \"Vierergruppe\"). This is a mark of closure: we presumably left out no important\noperator on the algebra.\nIn various contexts any of the three conjugations appears as a generalization of ordinary complex\nconjugation 18.\nHere are a few applications of the conjugation rules.\nAA = a 2 - ~a 2 1 = |A|1\n(3.4.34)\nFor invertible matrices\nA\nA-1 =\n(3.4.35)\n|A|\nFor unimodular matrices we have the useful rule:\nA-1\n\n= A\n(3.4.36)\nA Hermitian marrix A = A+ has real components h0,~h. We define a matrix to be positive if it is\nHermitian and has a positive trace and determinant:\nh2\nh2\nh0 > 0,\n|H| =\n- ~\n> 0\n(3.4.37)\nIf H is positive and unimodular, it can be parametrized as\nH = cosh(μ/2)1 + sinh(μ/2)hˆ · ~σ = exp (μ/2) hˆ · ~σ\n(3.4.38)\n18In the literature one often considers the conjugation of matrix, by taking the complex conjugates of the elements:\n∗\naik → a . This is the case in the well known spinor formalism of van der Waerden. We shall discuss the relation to\nik\nthis formalism in connection with relativistic spinors. However we note already that this convention is asymmetric in\nthe sense that σ1\n∗ = σ1, σ2\n∗ = -σ2.\n\nh\ni\n\nThe matrix exponential is defined by a power series that reduces to the trigonometric expression.\nThe factor 1/2 appears only for convenience in the next subsection.\nIn the Pauli algebra, the usual definition U + = U -1 for a unitary matrix takes the form\nu ∗ 1 + ~u ∗ · ~σ = |U|-1 (u01 - ~u · ~σ)\n(3.4.39)\nIf U is also unimodular, then\nu ∗\n0 = u0 = real\n(3.4.40)\n~u ∗ = ~u = imaginary\n(3.4.41)\nand\n∗\nu0 - ~u · ~u = u0 + ~u · ~u = 1\nU = cos(φ/2)1 - i sin(φ/2)ˆu · ~σ = exp (-i(φ/2)ˆu · ~σ)\n(3.4.42)\nA unitary unimodular matrix can be represented also in terms of elements\n-ξ∗\nξ0\nU =\n(3.4.43)\nξ∗\nξ1\nwith\n|ξ0|2 + |ξ1|2 = 1\n(3.4.44)\nwhere ξ0, ξ1, are the so-called Cayley-Klein parameters. We shall see that both this form, and the\naxis-angle representation, Equation 3.4.42, are useful in the proper context.\nWe turn now to the category of normal matrices N defined by the condition that they commute\nwith their Hermitian adjoint: N +N = NN +. Invoking the condition, Equation 3.4.26 , we have\n~n × ~n ∗ = 0\n(3.4.45)\nimplying that n ∗ is proportional to n, that is all the components of ~n must have the same phase.\nNormal matrices are thus of the form\nN = n01 + nnˆ · ~σ\n(3.4.46)\nwhere n0 and n are complex constants and hatn is a real unit vector, which we call the axis of N.\nIn particular, any unimodular normal matrix can be expressed as\nN = cosh(κ/2)1 + sinh(κ/2)ˆn · ~σ = exp ((κ/2)ˆn · ~σ)\n(3.4.47)\nwhere κ = μ - iφ, -inf < μ < inf, 0 ≤ φ < 4π , and nˆ is a real unit vector. If nˆ points in the \"3\"\ndirection, we have\nκ\nexp(κ )\nN0 = exp\nσ3 =\n(3.4.48)\nexp(-κ\n2 )\n\nThus the matrix exponentials, Equations 3.4.38, 3.4.42 and 3.4.48, are generalizations of a diagonal\nmatrix and the latter is distinguished by the requirement that the axis points in the z direction.\nClearly the normal matrix, Equation 3.4.48, is a commuting product of a positive matrix like Equa\ntion 3.4.38 with hˆ = nˆ and a unitary matrix like Equation 3.4.42, with uˆ = nˆ:\nN = HU = UH\n(3.4.49)\nThe expressions in Equation 3.4.49 are called the polar forms of N, the name being chosen to\nsuggest that the representation of N by H and U is analogous to the representation of a complex\nnumber z by a positive number r and a phase factor:\nz = r exp(-iφ/2)\n(3.4.50)\nWe shall show that, more generally, any invertible matrix has two unique polar forms\nA = HU = UH0\n(3.4.51)\nbut only the polar forms of normal matrices display the following equivalent special features:\n1. H and U commute\n2. hˆ = uˆ = nˆ\n3. H0 = H\nWe see from the polar decomposition theorem that our emphasis on positive and unitary matrices\nis justified, since all matrices of A2 can be produced from such factors. We proceed now to prove\nthe theorem expressed in Equation 3.4.51 by means of an explicit construction.\nFirst we form the matrix AA+, which is positive by the criteria 3.4.36:\na0a ∗\n0 + ~a · ~a ∗ > 0\n(3.4.52)\n|A||A+| > 0\n(3.4.53)\nLet AA+ be expressed in terms of an axis ˆh and the hyperbolic angle μ:\nˆ\nAA+ = b cosh μ1 + sinh μh · σˆ\n= b exp(μhˆ · σˆ)\n(3.4.54)\nwhere b is a positive constant. We claim that the Hermitian component of A is the positive square\nroot of 3.4.54\n1/2\nμ\nH = AA+\n= b1/2 exp( hˆ · σˆ)\n(3.4.55)\n\nwith\nU = H-1A,\nA = HU\n(3.4.56)\nThat U is indeed unitary is easily verified:\nU -1\nU + = A+H-1 ,\n= A-1H\n(3.4.57)\nand these expressions are equal by Equation 3.4.55.\nFrom Equation 3.4.56 we get\nA = U(U -1HU)\nand\nA = UH0\nwith H0 = U -1HU\n(3.4.58)\nIt remains to be shown that the polar forms 3.4.56 are unique. Suppose indeed, that for a particular\nA we have two factorizations\nA = HU = H1U1\n(3.4.59)\nthen\nAA+ = H2 = H1\n(3.4.60)\nBut, since AA+ has a unique positive square root, H1 = H, and\nU = H1\n-1A = H-1A = U\nq.e.d.\n(3.4.61)\nPolar forms are well known to exist for any n × n matrix, although proofs of uniqueness are\ngenerally formulated for abstract transformations rather than for matrices, and require that the\ntransformations be invertable 19.\n3.4.3 The restricted Lorentz group\nHaving completed the classification of the matrices of A2, we are ready to interpret them as opera\ntors and establish a connection with the Lorentz group. The straightforward procedure would be to\nintroduce a 2-dimensional complex vector space V(∈, C). By using the familiar bra-ket formalism\nwe write\nA|ξi = |ξ0i\n(3.4.62)\nA+hξ| = hξ0|\n(3.4.63)\nThe two-component complex vectors are commonly called spinors. We shall study their properties\nin detail in Section 5. The reason for this delay is that the physical interpretation of spinors is a\n19See [Hal58], page 170, and [Gel61], page 111. The theorem is stated only partially by Halmos as A = UH0 ,\nand by Gel'fand in the weak form A = HU = U 0H0 without stating U = U 0 . See also [HK61], page 343. For an\nextension of the theorem to singular matrices see [Whi71].\n\n~\nsubtle problem with many ramifications. One is well advised to consider at first situations in which\nthe object to be operated upon can be represented by a 2 × 2 matrix.\nThe obvious choice is to consider Hermitian matrices, the components of which are interpreted as\nrelativistic four-vectors. The connection between four-vectors and matrices is so close that it is\noften convenient to use the same symbol for both:\nA = a01 + ~a · ~σ\n(3.4.64)\nA = {a0,~a}\n(3.4.65)\nWe have\na 2 - ~a 2 = |A| = Tr(AA )\n(3.4.66)\nor more generally\na0b0 - ~a ·~b = 1 Tr(AB )\n(3.4.67)\nA Lorentz transformation is defined as a linear transformation\n{a0,~a} = L{a 0 ,~a 0}\n(3.4.68)\nthat leaves the expression 3.4.67 and hence also 3.4.66 invariant. We require moreover that the\nsign of the \"time component\" a0 be invariant (orthochronic Lorentz transformation L↑), and that\nthe determinant of the 4x4 matrix L be positive (proper Lorentz transformation L+). If both\nconditions are satisfied, we speak of the restricted Lorentz group L↑ . This is the only one to be of\n+\ncurrent interest for us, and until further notice \"Lorentz group\" is to be interpreted in this restricted\nsense.\nNote that A can be interpreted as any of the four-vectors discussed in Section 3.2: R = {r, ~r},\nK = {k0, k},\nP = {p0, ~p}\n(3.4.69)\nAlthough these vectors and their matrix equivalents have identical transformation properties, they\ndiffer in the possible range of their determinants. A negative |P | can arise only for an unphysical\nimaginary rest mass. By contrast, a positive R corresponds to a time-like displacement pointing\ntoward the future, an R with a negative |R| to a space-like displacement and |R| = 0 is associated\nwith the light cone. For the wave vector we have by definition |K| = 0.\nTo describe a Lorentz transformation in the Pauli algebra we try the \"ansatz\"\nA0 = V AW\n(3.4.70)\nwith |V | = |W | = 1 in order to preserve |A|. Reality of the vector, i.e., hermiticity of the matrix\nA is preserved if the additional condition W = V + is satisfied. Thus the transformation\nA0 = V AV +\n(3.4.71)\n\nleaves expression 3.4.66 invariant. It is easy to show that 3.4.67 is invariant as well.\n\nThe complex reflection A transforms as\nA 0\nA\n= V\nV\n(3.4.72)\nand the product of two four-vectors:\n(AB )0 = V AV +V B V\n= V (AB )V -1\n(3.4.73)\nThis is a so-called similarity transformation. By taking the trace of Equation 3.4.73 we confirm that\nthe inner product 3.4.67 is invariant under 3.4.72. We have to remember that a cyclic permutation\ndoes not affect the trace of a product of matrices 20. Thus Equation 3.4.72 indeed induces a Lorentz\ntransformation in the four-vector space of A.\nIt is well known that the converse statement is also true: to every transformation of the restricted\nLorentz group L↑ there are associated two matrices differing-only by sign (their parameters φ\n+\ndiffer by 2π) in such a fashion as to constitute a two-to-one homomorphism between the group\nof unimodular matrices SL(2, C) and the group L↑\nIt is said also that SL(2, C) provides a\n+.\ntwo-valued representation of L+\n↑ . We shall prove this statement by demonstrating explicitly the\nconnection between the matrices V and the induced, or associated group operations.\n\nWe note first that A and A correspond in the tensor language to the contravariant and the covariant\nrepresentation of a vector. We illustrate the use of the formalism by giving an explicit form for the\ninverse of 3.4.72\nA = V -1A0V +-1 ≡ V A0V\n(3.4.74)\nWe invoke the polar decomposition theorem Equation 3.4.49 of Section 3.4.2 and note that it is\nsufficient to establish this connection for unitary and positive matrices respectively.\nConsider at first\nA0 = UAU + ≡ UAU -1\n(3.4.75)\nwith\n\nφ\niφ\nU(ˆu, 2 ) ≡ exp - 2 ˆu · ~σ\nu 2\n1 + u 2\n2 + u 2\n3 = 1,\n0 ≤ φ < 4π\n(3.4.76)\nThe set of all unitary unimodular matrices described by Equation 3.4.76 form a group that is\ncommonly called SU(2).\n\n20Since for hermitian matrices A = A, we use now A as in Equation 3.4.34 (Section 3.4.2), since in Section 4 A\nwill prove to be of greater generality, and being automorphic, it is easier to handle.\n\nLet us decompose ~a:\n~a = ~ak + ~a⊥\n(3.4.77)\n~ak = (~a · uˆ)ˆu,\n~a⊥ = ~a - ~ak = uˆ × (~a × uˆ)\n(3.4.78)\nIt is easy to see that Equation 3.4.75 leaves a0 and ak invariant and induces a rotation around uˆ by\nan angle φ: R{ˆu, φ}.\nConversely, to every rotation R{ˆu, φ} there correspond two matrices:\nφ\nφ + 2π\nφ\nU(ˆu, ) and U(ˆu,\n) = -U(ˆu, )\n(3.4.79)\nWe have 1 → 2 homomorphism between SO(3) and SU(2), the latter is said to be a two-valued\nrepresentation of the former. By establishing this correspondence we have solved the problem of\nparametrization formulated on page 13. The nine parameters of the orthogonal 3 × 3 matrices are\nreduced to the three independent ones of U(ˆu, φ\n2 ). Moreover we have the simple result\ninφ\nU n = exp -\nuˆ · ~σ\n(3.4.80)\nwhich reduces to the de Moivre theorem if nˆ · ~σ = σ3.\nSome comment is in order concerning the two-valuedness of the SU(2) representation. This comes\nabout because of the use of half angles in the algebraic formalism which is deeply rooted in the\ngeometrical structure of the rotation group. (See the Rodrigues-Hamilton theorem in Section 2.2.)\nWhereas the two-valuedness of the SU(2) representation does not affect the transformation of the\nA vector based on the bilateral expression 3.4.75, the situation will be seen to be different in the\nspinorial theory based on Equation 3.4.62, since under certain conditions the sign of the spinor |ξi\nis physically meaningful 21.\nThe above discussion of the rotation group is incomplete even within the classical theory. The\nrotation R{ˆ\nu unaffected. A more appropriate object to be rotated is the\nu, φ} leaves vectors along ˆ\nCartesian triad, to be discussed in Section 5.\nWe consider now the case of a positive matrix V = H\nA0 = HAH\n(3.4.81)\nwith\nH = exp(μhˆ · σ)\n(3.4.82)\nh2\n1 + h2\n2 + h3\n2 = 1,\n-inf < μ < inf\n(3.4.83)\n21Historically, SU(2) was introduced into physics in order to account for the electron spin within quantum mechan\nics. This is a case where the two-valuedness of the formalism is significant, although not too well understood. For this\nreason there is a tendency in the literature to work as long as possible with the single-valued representations involving\n3 × 3 matrices. On closer inspection this turns out to be a false economy.\n\nWe decompose ~a as\n~a = ahˆ + ~a⊥\n(3.4.84)\nand using the fact that (~a · ~σ) and (~b · ~σ) commute for ~ak~b and anticommute for ~a ⊥ ~b, we obtain\nA0 = exp(μhˆ · σ) a01 + ahˆ · σ + ~a⊥ · σ exp(μhˆ · σ)\n(3.4.85)\n= exp(μhˆ · σ) a01 + ~ahˆ · σ + ~a⊥ · σ\n(3.4.86)\nHence\na 0\n0 = cosh μa0 + sinh μa\n(3.4.87)\na 0 = sinh μa0 + cosh μa0\n(3.4.88)\n~a 0\n= ~a⊥\n(3.4.89)\n⊥\nThis is to be compared with Table 3.1, but remember that we have shifted from the passive to the\nactive interpretation, from alias to alibi.\nPositive matrices with a common axis form a group (Wigner's \"little group\"), but in general the\nproduct of Hermitian matrices with different axes are not Hermitian. There arises a unitary factor,\nwhich is the mathematical basis for the famous Thomas precession.\nLet us consider now a normal matrix\nμ\nφ\nμ - iφ\n= H(ˆ\n)U(ˆ\nV = N\nk,\nk, ) = exp\nnˆ · σ\n(3.4.90)\nwhere we have the commuting product of a rotation and a Lorentz transformation with the same\naxis nˆ. Such a constellation is called a Lorentz 4-screw22.\nAn arbitrary sequence of pure Lorentz transformations and pure rotations is associated with a pair\nof matrices V and -V , which in the general case is of the form\nμ\nφ\nφ\nμ\nh,\nu,\nu,\n)\nH(ˆ\n)U(ˆ\n) = U(ˆ\n)H0(hˆ0 ,\n(3.4.91)\nAccording to Equation 3.4.58 of Section 3.4.2, H and H0 are connected by a similarity transfor\nmation, which does not affect the angle μ, but only the axis of the transformation. (See the next\nsection.)\nThis matrix depends on the 6 parameters, ˆ\nu, φ, and thus we have solved the general problem\nh, μ, ˆ\nof parametrization mentioned above.\nFor a normal matrix hˆ = uˆ = nˆ and the number of parameters is reduced to 4.\n22See [Syn65], page 89.\n\nOur formalism enables us to give a closed form for two arbitrary normal matrices and the corre\nsponding 4-screws.\n[N, N 0] = 2i sinh κ sinh κ (ˆn × nˆ0) · ~σ\n(3.4.92)\nwhere κ = μ - iφ, κ0 = μ0 - iφ0 .\nIn the literature the commutation relations are usually given in terms of infinitesimal operators\nwhich are defined as follows:\ndφ\ni\nU(ˆuk,\n)\n=\n1 - dφσk = 1 + dφIk\n(3.4.93)\ni\nIk = - σk\n(3.4.94)\ndμ\ndμ\nH(hˆk,\n) = 1 +\nσk = 1 + dμLk\n(3.4.95)\nLk =\nσk\n(3.4.96)\nThe commutation relations are\n[I1, I2]\n= I3\n(3.4.97)\n[L1, L2]\n= -I3\n(3.4.98)\n[L1, I2]\n= L3\n(3.4.99)\nand cyclic permutations.\nIt is a well known result of the Lie-Cartan theory of continuous group that these infinitesimal-\ngenerators determine the entire group. Since we have represented these generators in SL(2, C),\nwe have completed the demonstration that the entire group L↑ is accounted for in our formalism.\n+\n3.4.4 Similarity classes and canonical forms of active transformations\nIt is evident that a Lorentz transformation induced by a matrix H(ˆ\n2 ) assumes a particularly\nh, μ\nsimple form if the z-axis of the coordinate system is placed in the direction of hˆ. The diagonal\nmatrix H(ˆz, μ\n2 ) is said to be the canonical form of the transformation. This statement is a special\ncase of the problem of canonical forms of linear transformations, an important chapter in linear\nalgebra.\nLet us consider a linear mapping in a vector space. A particular choice of basis leads to a matrix\nrepresentation of the mapping, and representations associated with different frames are connected\nby similarity transformations. Let A1, be an arbitrary and S an invertible matrix. A similarity\ntransformation is effected on A, by\nA2 = SA1S-1\n(3.4.100)\n\nMatrices related by similarity transformation are called similar, and matrices similar to each other\nconstitute a similarity class.\nIn usual practice the mapping-refers to a vector space as in Equation 3.4.62 of Section 3.4.3:\nA1|ξi = |ξ0i\n(3.4.101)\nThe subscript refers to the basis \"1.\" A change of basis Σ1 → Σ2 is expressed as\n|ξi = S|ξi1,\n|ξ0i = S|ξ0i\n(3.4.102)\nInserting into Equation 3.4.101 we obtain\nA1S-1|ξi2 = S-1|ξi2\n(3.4.103)\nand hence\nA2|ξi2 = |ξi2\n(3.4.104)\nwhere A2 is indeed given by Equation 3.4.100.\nThe procedure we have followed thus far to represent Lorentz transformations in A2 does not quite\nfollow this standard pattern.\nWe have been considering mappings of the space of fourvectors which in turn were represented\nas 2 × 2 complex matrices. Thus both operators and operands are matrices of A2. In spite of this\ndifference in interpretation, the matrix representations in different frames are still related according\nto Equation 3.4.100.\nThis can be shown as follows. Consider a unimodular matrix A, that induces a Lorentz transfor\nmation in P -space, whereby the matrices refer to the basis Σ1:\nP1\n0 = A1P1A+\n(3.4.105)\nWe interpret Equation 3.4.105 in the active sense as a linear mapping of P -space on itself that\ncorresponds physically to some dynamic process that alters P in a linear way.\nWe shall see in Section 4 that the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle during the time dt can\nbe indeed considered as an active Lorentz transformation. (See also page 26.)\nThe process has a physical meaning independent of the frame of the observer, but the matrix\nrepresentations of P, P 0 and of A depend on the frame. The four-momenta in the two frames are\nconnected by a Lorentz transformation interpreted in the passive sense:\nP2 = SP1S+\n(3.4.106)\nP2 = SP 1\n0S+\n(3.4.107)\nwith |S| = 1. Solving for P, P 0 and inserting into Equation 3.4.105, we obtain\nS-1P2\n0S + = A1S-1P2S +A1\n+ S\n(3.4.108)\n\nor\nP2\n0 = A2P2A+\n(3.4.109)\nwhere A2 and A1 are again connected by the similarity transformation 3.4.100.\nWe may apply the polar decomposition theorem to the matrix S. In the special case that S is unitary,\nwe speak of a unitary similarity transformation corresponding to the rotation of the coordinate\nsystem discussed at the onset of this section. However, the general case will lead us to less obvious\nphysical applications.\nThe above considerations provide sufficient motivation to examine the similarity classes of A2.\nWe shall see that all of them have physical applications, although the interpretation of singular\nmappings will be discussed only later.\nThe similarity classes can be characterized in several convenient ways. For example, one may use\ntwo independent similarity invariants shared by all the matrices A = a0l + ~a · ~σ in the class. We\nshall find it convenient to choose\n1. the determinant |A|, and\n2. the quantity ~a2\nThe trace is also a similarity invariant, but it is not independent: a2\n0 = |A| + ~a2 .\nAlternatively, one can characterize the whole class by one representative member of it, some matrix\nA0 called the canonical form for the class (See Table 3.2).\nWe proceed at first to characterize the similarity classes in terms of the invariants 1 and 2. We\nrecall that a matrix A is invertible if |A| 6\n0 and singular if |A|\n0. Without significant loss\n=\n=\nof generality, we can normalize the invertible matrices of A2 to be unimodular, so that we need\ndiscuss only classes of singular and of unimodular matrices. As a second invariant to characterize\na class, we choose ~a · a, and we say that a matrix A is axial if ~ ~ 6\n~\na · a = 0. In this case, there exists a\nunit vector aˆ (possibly complex) such that ~a = a · aˆ where a is a complex constant. The unit vector\naˆ is called the axis of A. Conversely, the matrix A is non-axial if ~a · ~a = 0, the vector ~a is called\nisotropic or a null-vector, it cannot be expressed in terms of an axis.\nThe concept of axis as here defined is the generalization of the real axis introduced in connection\nwith normal matrices on page 33. The usefulness of this concept is apparent from the following\ntheorem:\nTheorem 1. For any two unit vectors vˆ1, and vˆ2, real or complex, there exists a matrix S such that\nvˆ2 · ~σ = Svˆ1 · ~σS1\n(3.4.110)\nProof. We construct one such matrix S from the following considerations. If vˆ1, and vˆ2 are real,\nthen let S be the unitary matrix that rotates every vector by an angle π about an axis which bisects\nthe angle between vˆ1, and vˆ2:\nS = -isˆ · ~σ\n(3.4.111)\n\nwhere\nvˆ1 + ˆv2\nsˆ = √\n(3.4.112)\n2ˆv1 · vˆ2 + 2\nEven if vˆ1, and vˆ2 are not real, it is easily verified that S as given formally by Equations 3.4.111\nand 3.4.112, does indeed send vˆ1 to vˆ2. Naturally S is not unique; for instance, any matrix of the\nform\n\nμ2\nφ2\nμ1\nφ1\nS = exp\n- i\n~v2 · ~σ (-isˆ · ~σ) exp\n- i\n~v1 · ~σ\n(3.4.113)\nwill send vˆ1 to vˆ2.\nThis construction fails only if\nvˆ1 · vˆ2 + 1 = 0\n(3.4.114)\nthat is for the transformation vˆ1 →-vˆ2. In this trivial case we choose\nS = -isˆ · ~σ,\nwhere sˆ ⊥ ~v1\n(3.4.115)\nSince in the Pauli algebra diagonal matrices are characterized by the fact that their axis is xˆ3, we\nhave proved the following theorem:\nTheorem 2. All axial matrices are diagonizable, but normal matrices and only normal matrices\nare diagonizable by a unitary similarity transformation.\nThe diagonal forms are easily ascertained both for singular and the unimodular cases. (See Ta\nble 3.2.) Because of their simplicity they are called also canonical forms. Note that they can be\nmultiplied by any complex number in order to get all of the axial matrices of A2.\nThe situation is now entirely clear: the canonical forms show the nature of the mapping; a unitary\nsimilarity transformation merely changes the geometrical orientation of the axis. The angle of\ncircular and hyperbolic rotation specified by a0 is invariant. A general transformation complexifies\nthe axis. This situation comes about if in the polar form of the matrix A = HU, the factors have\ndistinct real axes, and hence do not commute.\nThere remains to deal with the case of nonaxial matrices. Consider A = ~a · ~σ with ~a2 = 0. Let us\ndecompose the isotropic vector ~a into real and imaginary parts:\n~a = α~ + iβ~\n(3.4.116)\nHence α~ 2 - β~2 = 0 and α · β = 0. Since the real and the imaginary parts of a are perpendicular,\nwe can rotate these directions by a unitary similarity transformation into the x- and y-directions\nrespectively. The transformed matrix is\n\nα\n2 (σ1 + iσ2) =\nα\n(3.4.117)\n\n=\nwith a positive. A further similarity transformation with\nα-1/2\nS =\n(3.4.118)\nα1/2\ntransforms Equation 3.4.117 into the canonical form given in Table 3.2.\nAs we have seen in Section 3.4.3 all unimodular matrices induce Lorentz transformations in\nMinkowski, or four-momentum space. According to the results summarized in Table 3.2, the\nmappings induced by axial matrices can be brought by similarity transformations into so-called\nLorentz four-screws consisting of a circular and hyperbolic rotation around the same axis, or in\nother words: a rotation around an axis, and a boost along the same axis.\nWhat about the Lorentz transformation induced by a nonaxial matrix? The nature of these trans\nformations is very different from the common case, and constitutes an unusual limiting situation.\nIt is justified to call it an exceptional Lorentz transformation. The special status of these transfor\nmations was recognized by Wigner in his fundamental paper on the representations of the Lorentz\ngroup23.\nThe present approach is much more elementary than Wigner's, both from the point of view of\nmathematical technique, and also the purpose in mind. Wigner uses the standard algebraic tech\nnique of elementary divisors to establish the canonical Jordan form of matrices. We use, instead\na specialized technique adapted to the very simple situation in the Pauli algebra. More important,\nWigner was concerned with the problem of representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group,\nwhereas we consider the much simpler problem of the group structure itself, mainly in view of\napplication to the electromagnetic theory.\nThe intuitive meaning of the exceptional transformations is best recognized from the polar form of\nthe generating matrix. This can be carried out by direct application of the method discussed at the\nend of the last section. It is more instructive, however, to express the solution in terms of (circular\nand hyperbolic) trigonometry.\nWe ask for the conditions the polar factors have to satisfy in order that the relation\nμ\nφ\nσ = H(ˆ\n1 + ˆa · ~\nh, )U(ˆu, )\n(3.4.119)\nshould hold with μ 6\n0, φ = 0. Since all matrices are unimodular, it is sufficient to consider the\nequality of the traces:\nμ\nφ\nμ\nφ\nT rA = cosh( ) cos( ) - i sinh( ) sin( ) hˆ · uˆ = 1\n(3.4.120)\nThis condition is satisfied if and only if\nhˆ · uˆ = 0\n(3.4.121)\n23[Wig39]; See also [Syn65], particularly for the connections with the electromagnetic field treated in our Section 4.\n[Pae69], p. 114, This author speaks of \"α-transformations.\"\n\nand\nμ\nφ\ncosh( ) cos( ) = 1\n(3.4.122)\nThe axes of circular and hyperbolic rotation are thus perpendicular, to each other and the angles\nof these rotations are related in a unique fashion: half of the circular angle is the so-called Guder\nmannian function of half of the hyperbolic angle\nφ\nμ\n= gd\n(3.4.123)\nHowever, if μ and φ are infinitesimal, we get\n\nφ2\nμ\n1 +\n+ . . .\n1 +\n+ . . .\n=\n2 - φ2\nμ\n1, i.e.,\n(3.4.124)\n= 0\n(3.4.125)\nWe note finally that products of exceptional matrices need not be exceptional, hence exceptional\nLorentz transformations do not form a group.\nIn spite of their special character, the exceptional matrices have interesting physical applications,\nboth in connection with the electromagnetic field as discussed in Section 4, and also for the con\nstruction of representations of the inhomogeous Lorentz group [Pae69, Wig39].\nWe conclude by noting that the canonical forms of Table 3.2 lend themselves to express the powers\nk\nA0 in simple form.\nFor the axial singular matrix we have\nA 2\n0 = A\n(3.4.126)\nThese projection matrices are called idempotent. The nonaxial singular matrices are nilpotent:\nA 2\n0 = 0\n(3.4.127)\nThe exceptional matrices (unimodular nonaxial) are raised to any power k (even non-real) by the\nformula\nAk =\n1k (1 + k~a · ~σ)\n(3.4.128)\n=\n1k exp (k~a · ~σ)\n(3.4.129)\nFor integer k, the factor 1k becomes unity. The axial unimodular case is handled by formulas that\nare generalizations of the well known de Moivre formulas:\nAk = 1k exp kκ + kl2πi\n(3.4.130)\nwhere l is an integer. For integer k, Equation 3.4.130 reduces to\nAk = exp k( κ )~a · ~σ\n(3.4.131)\n\nIn connection with these formulae, we note that for positive A (φ = 0 and a real) , there is a unique\npositive mth root of A:\nn\no\nA = exp (μ)ˆa · ~σ\n(3.4.132)\nn 2\no\nA1/m = exp ( μ )ˆa · ~σ\n(3.4.133)\n2m\nThe foregoing results are summarized in Table 3.2.\nUnimodular\n|A| = 1\nSingular\n|A| = 0\nAxial\n~a = aˆa\nA = exp(κ\n2~a · ~σ)\nA0 =\nexp(κ\n2 )\nexp(-κ\n2 )\n\nκ = μ - iφ\n-inf < μ < inf\n0 ≤ φ < 4π\nA = 1\n2 (1 ± ~a · ~σ)\nA0 =\n1 0\n0 0\n\n,\n\nNon-axial\n~a2 = 0\n~a = 1\n2 (ˆe1 ± ˆe2)\nA = 1 + ~a · ~σ = exp(~a · ~σ)\nA0 =\n1 1\n0 1\n\nA = ~a · ~σ\nA0 =\n0 1\n0 0\n\n,\n\nTable 3.2: Canonical Forms for the Simlarity classes of A2.\n\n4 Pauli Algebra and Electrodynamics\n4.1 Lorentz transformation and Lorentz force\nThe main importance of the Pauli algebra is to provide us with a stepping stone for the theory of\nspinor spaces to which we turn in Section 5. Yet it is useful to stop at this point to show that the\nformalism already developed provides us with an efficient framework for limited, yet important\naspects of classical electrodyanmics (CED).\nWe have seen on page 26 that the effect on electric field on a test charge, a \"boost,\" can be con\nsidered as an active Lorentz transformation, whereby the field is proportional to the \"hyperbolic\nangular velocity μ .\"\nThis is in close analogy with the well known relation between the magnetic field and the cyclotron\nfrequency, i.e., a \"circular angular velocity\" φ . These results had been obtained under very special\nconditions. The Pauli algebra is well suited to state them in much greater generality.\nThe close connection between the algebra of the Lorentz group and that of the electromagnetic\nfield, is well known 24. However, instead of developing the two algebras separately and noting the\nisomorphism of the results, we utilize the mathematical properties of the Lorentz group developed\nin Section 3 and translate them into the language of electrodynamics. The definition of the elec\ntromagnetic field implied by this procedure is, of course, hypothetical, and we turn to experience\nto ascertain its scope and limits. The proper understanding of the limitation of this conception is\nparticularly important, as it serves to identify the direction for the deepening of the theory. The\nstandard operational definition of the electromagnetic field involves the use of a test charge. Ac\ncordingly we assume the existence of particles that can act in such a capacity. The particle is to\ncarry a charge e, a constant rest mass m, and the effect of the field acting during the time dt is\nto manifest itself in a change of the 4-momentum only, without involving any change in internal\nstructure 25.\nThis means that the field has a sufficiently low frequency in the rest frame of the particle so as\nnot to affect its internal structure. This is in harmony with the temporary exclusion of radiative\ninteraction stated already.\nLet the test charge be exposed to an electromagnetic field during a small time dt. We propose\nto describe the resulting change of the four-momentum P → P 0 = P + dP as an infinitesimal\nLorentz transformation. In this preliminary form the statement would seem to be trivial, since it\n24See [Syn35, Syn65] pp 87 & 343.\n25This assumption suggests the drawing of a line between two kinds of electromagnetic interactions: (i) the Lorentz\nforce; (ii) radiative interaction. We start with case (i), continue in Section 4.2 with the free field, but postpone the\ndiscussion of radiative interaction which affects the intrinsic structure and the rest mass of the particle. This subdivision\nof the interaction problem is not in the spirit of the classical theory. But then the classical radiation theory \"breaks\ndown\" on the atomic level. Conforming to our program stated in Section 3.1 we do not wish to stretch theories beyond\ntheir empirical validity, and postpone the discussion of radiative interaction until we shall be ready to deal with it in\nthe framework of quantum theory.\n\nis valid for any force that does not affect the intrinsic structure, say a combination of gravitational\nand frictional forces. In order to characterize specifically the Lorentz force, we have to add that the\ncharacterization of the field is independent of the fourmomentum of the test charge, moreover it is\nindependent of the frame of reference of the observer. These conditions can be expressed formally\nin the following.\nPostulate 1. The effect of the Lorentz force on a particle (test charge) is represented as the trans\nformation of the four-momentum space of the particle unto itself, and the transformations are el\nements of the active Lorentz group. Moreover, matrix representations in different Lorentz frames\nare connected by similarity transformations. (See Section 3.4.4.)\nWe now proceed to show that this postulate implies the known properties of the Lorentz force.\nFirst, we show that an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation indeed reduces to the Lorentz force\nprovided we establish a \"dictionary\" between the parameters of the transformation and the electro\nmagnetic field (see below Equation 4.1.12). Consider a pure Lorentz transformation along hˆ\np 0 = p cosh μ + p0 sinh μ\n(4.1.1)\np0\n0 = p sinh μ + p0 cosh μ\n(4.1.2)\nwhere p~ = phˆ + p~ with ~p · ~h = 0. For infinitesimal transformations μ → dμ:\np 0 - p = p0dμ\n(4.1.3)\np0\n0 - p0 = pdμ\n(4.1.4)\nor\n~p\n= p0μ hˆ\n(4.1.5)\np 0 = ~p · hˆμ\n(4.1.6)\nBy making use of\np~ = mc sinh μ = γm~v\n(4.1.7)\np0 = mc cosh μ = γmc\nwe obtain\n~p\n= pmchˆμ\n(4.1.8)\n~v ˆ\np 0 = pm · hμ\nc\nTurning to rotation we have from Equation A.3.8 of Appendix A (See note on page 51 ).\n~0 = ~\nu × ~p⊥ sin φ\n(4.1.9)\np\np⊥ cos φ + ˆ\n⊥\n\nFor an infinitesimal rotation φ ' dφ, and by using Equation 4.1.7 we obtain, since ~p0\nk = p~k and\np~k × uˆ = 0,\np~\np = -~\nu dφ = -γm~\nu dφ\n0 - ~\np × ˆ\nv × ˆ\n(4.1.10)\nor,\n~p\n= -γm~v × ˆ\n(4.1.11)\nu dφ\nWith the definitions of 3.3.28 and 3.3.29 of page 26 written vectorially:\nγmc\n~\nˆ\nE =\nμ h\ne\nB~\n= -γmc φ uˆ\n(4.1.12)\ne\nEquations 4.1.8 and 4.1.9 reduce to the Lorentz force equations.\nLet us consider now an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation generated by\nμ\niφ\nV\n= 1 + hˆ · ~σ -\nuˆ · ~σ\n(4.1.13)\n= 1 + edt\nE~ + iB~\n· ~σ\n(4.1.14)\n2γmc\nedt\n= 1 +\nF\n(4.1.15)\n2γmc\nwith\nf~ = ~\nB,\nF = f~ · ~\n(4.1.16)\nE + i ~\nσ\nIt is apparent from Equations 4.1.15 and 4.1.16 that the transformation properties of V and F are\nidentical. Since the transformation of V has been obtained already in Section 3.4.4, we can write\ndown at once that of the field f~.\nLet us express the passive Lorentz transformation of the four-momentum P from the inertial frame\nΣ to Σ0 as\nP 0 = SP S+\n(4.1.17)\nwhere S is unimodular. The field matrix transforms by a similarity transformation:\nF 0 = SF S-1\n(4.1.18)\nwith the complex reflections (contragradient entities) transforming as\nP 0 = S P S -1\n(4.1.19)\nF 0\nS F S +\n=\n(4.1.20)\nFor\nˆ\nS = H = exp(-μh · ~σ)\n(4.1.21)\n\n~\n× ~\n\nwe obtain the passive Lorentz transformation for a frame Σ2 moving with respect to Σ1, with-the\nvelocity\n~v = chˆ tanh μ\n(4.1.22)\nF 0 = HFH-1\n(4.1.23)\nWe extract from here the standard expressions by using the familiar decomposition\nf~ = f~k + f~⊥ = ( f~ · hˆ)hˆ\n(4.1.24)\nwe get\nf~0\n~\nk = fk\n(4.1.25)\n~\n~\nH-1 = H2 ~\nf⊥ · ~σ = H\nf⊥ · ~σ\nf⊥ · ~σ\n(4.1.26)\n=\ncosh μ - sinh μhˆ · ~σ f~⊥ · ~σ\n(4.1.27)\nHence\nf~⊥\n= f~⊥ cosh μ + i sinh μ hˆ × f~⊥\n(4.1.28)\n~\nhˆ × ~\n= cosh μ f⊥ + i tanh μ\nf⊥\n(4.1.29)\n~v\n= γ\nf⊥ + i\nf⊥\n(4.1.30)\nc\nwhere we used Equation 4.1.22. Inserting from Equation 4.1.16 we get\nE~ 0\n~\n⊥\n= γ\nE⊥ + ~v × B~⊥\nc\nB~ 0\n~\n⊥\n= γ\nB⊥ - ~v × E~⊥\n(4.1.31)\nc\nE~ 0\n~\nB~ 0\n~\n=\n=\nk\nEk,\nk\nBk\nIt is interesting to compare the two compact forms 4.1.18 and 4.1.31. Whereas the latter may be\nthe most convenient for solving specific problems, the former will be the best stepping stone for\nthe deepening of the theory. The only Lorentz invariant of the field is the determinant, which we\nwrite for convenience with the negative sign:\n-|F | = T rF 2 = f~2 = E~ 2 - B~ 2 + 2iE~ · B~ = g 2 e 2Ψ\n(4.1.32)\nHence we obtain the well know invariants\nI1 = E~ 2 - B~ 2 = g 2 cos 2ψ\n(4.1.33)\nI2 =\n2E~ · B~ = g 2 sin 2ψ\nWe distinguish two cases\n\n~\n~\n1. f 2 6= 0\n2. f 2 = 0\nThese cases can be associated with the similarity classes of Table 3.2. In the case (i) F is uni\nmodular axial, for (ii) it is nonaxial singular. (Since F is traceless, the two other entries in the\ntable do not apply.) We first dispose of case (ii). A field having this Lorentz invariant property is\ncalled a null-field. The F matrix generates an exceptional Lorentz transformation (Section 3.4.4).\nIn this field configuration E~ and B~ are perpendicular and are of equal size. This is a relativistically\ninvariant property that is characteriestic of plane waves to be discussed in Section 4.2.\nIn the \"normal\" case (i) it is possible to find a canonical Lorentz frame, in which the electric and\nthe magnetic fields are along the same line, they are parallel, or antiparallel. The Lorentz screw\ncorresponds to a Maxwell wrench26. It is specified by a unit vector ˆsn and the values of the fields\nin the canonical frame Ecan and Bcan . The wrench may degenerate can can with Ecan = 0, or\nBcan = 0. The canonical frame is not unique, since a Lorentz transformation along nˆ leaves the\ncanonical fields invariant.\nWe can evaluate the invariant eqn:iii-8-18ab in the canonical frame and obtain\nE2 - B2\ncan\ncan = I1 = g 2 cos 2ψ\n(4.1.34)\n2EcanBcan = I2 = g 2 sin 2ψ\n(4.1.35)\nOne obtains from here\nEcan = g cos ψ\n(4.1.36)\nBcan = g sin ψ\n(4.1.37)\nThe invariant character of the field is determined by the ratio\nBcan = tan ψ\n(4.1.38)\nEcan\nthat has been called its pitch by Synge (op. cit. p. 333) who discussed the problem of canonical\nframes of the electromagnetic field with the standard tensorial method.\nThe definition of pitch in problem #8 is the reciprocal to the one here given and should be changed\nto agree with Eq. (20)\nNOTE: Eq. (18) of Appendix A is incorrect. Eq. (6) is identical\nto the unnumbered equation preceding (18).\n26See Synge, as quoted on page 47.\n\n~\n4.2 The Free Maxwell Field\nOur apporach to CED thus far is unusual inasmuch as we have effectively defined, classifed and\ntransformed the electromagnetic field at a small region of space-time without having used the\nMaxwell equations. This is, of course, an indication of the effectiveness of our definition of the\nfield in terms of active Lorentz transformations.\nIn order to arrive at the Maxwell equations we invoke the standard principle of relativistic invari\nance, involving the passive interpretation of the Lorentz group.\nPostulate 2. The electromagnetic field satisfies a first order differential equation in the space-time\ncoordinates that is covariant under Lorentz transformations.\nWe consider the four-dimensional del operator {∂0, r} with ∂0 = ∂/∂(ct) = ∂/∂r0 as a four-\nvector, with its matrix equivalent\nD = ∂0 -r · ~σ\n(4.2.1)\nThe rationale for the minus sign is as follows. Let D operate on a function representing a plane\nwave:\nψ = exp -i(ωt - ~k · ~r) = exp -i(k0r0 - ~k · ~r)\n(4.2.2)\nwe have\n\niDψ = k01 + ~k · ~σ ψ = Kψ\n(4.2.3)\nThus D has the same transformation properties as K:\nD0 = SDS+\n(4.2.4)\nwhile the complex reflection\nD = ∂01 + r · ~σ\n(4.2.5)\n\ntransforms as K, i.e.\nD 0\nS\n= DS-1\n(4.2.6)\n\nBy using the transformation rules 4.1.18, 4.1.20 of the last section we see that DF transforms as a\nfour-vector J:\n\nS\nSF S-1\nS\n(4.2.7)\nDS-1\n= JS-1\nThus\n\nDF = J\n(4.2.8)\nis a differential equation satisfying the conditions of Postulate 2. Setting tentatively\nj\nJ = ρ1 +\n· ~σ\n(4.2.9)\nc\n\n~\n\nn\no\nn\no\n\nwith ρ,~j the densities of charge and current, 4.2.8 is indeed a compact form of the Maxwell equa\ntions.\nThis is easily verified by sorting out the terms with the factors (1, σk) and by separating the real\nand imaginary parts.\nBy operating on the Equation 4.2.9 with D and taking the trace we obtain\nDDF\n\n= (∂0\n2 -r2)F = DJ\n(4.2.10)\nand\n1 T rD J = ∂0ρ + 1 r · ~j = 0\n(4.2.11)\nc\nThese are standard results which are easily provided by the formalism. However, we do not have\nan explicit expression for J that would be satisfactory for a theory of radiative interaction.\nTherefore, in accordance with our program stated in Section 4.1 we set J = 0 and examine only\nthe free field that obeys the homogeneous equations\nDF =\n(4.2.12)\n∂2\n0 -r2 F =\nThe simplest elementary solution of 4.2.12 are monochromatic plane waves from which more\ncomplicated solutions can be built up. Hence we consider\nF (~r, t) = F+(~k, ω) exp i(ωt - ~k · ~r)\n+ F-(~k, ω) exp i(ωt - ~k · ~r)\n(4.2.13)\nwhere F± are matrices independent of space-time. Inserting into Equation 4.2.12 yields the condi\ntion\nω2 - c 2k2 = 0\n(4.2.14)\nIntroducing the notation\nθ = k0r0 - ~k · ~r\n(4.2.15)\nwe write Equation 4.2.13 as\nF (~r, t) = F+ exp(-iθ) + F- exp(iθ)\n(4.2.16)\nInserting into 4.2.12 we have\nKF± = K E~± + iB~± · ~σ = 0\n(4.2.17)\n\nFrom here we get explicitly\n~k · E~± + iB~± = 0\n(4.2.18)\n~\n= iˆ\n~\nE± + iB~±\nkx E± + iB~±\n(4.2.19)\nand we infer the well known properties of plane waves: E~ and B~ are of equal magnitude, and\n~ B, ~\nE, ~ k from a right-handed Cartesian triad. We note that this constellation corresponds to the\nfield of the type (ii) with f~2 = 0 mentioned on page 51.\nSince the classical E~, B~ are real, we have also the relations\n~\nE~ ∗\n~\nB~ ∗\nE- =\n+,\nB- =\n+\n(4.2.20)\nConsider now the case in which\nf~- = E~- + iB~- = 0\n(4.2.21)\nwhich, in view of 4.2.20 implies\nE~+ = iB~+\n(4.2.22)\nThus at a fixed point and direction in space the electric field lags the magnetic field by a phase\nπ/2, and f~+ = (E~+ + iB~+) is the amplitude of a circularly polarized wave of positive helicity,\ni.e., the rotation of the electric and magnetic vectors and the wave vector ~k form a right screw\nor the linear and angular momentum point in the same direction +~k. In the traditional optical\nterminology this is called a left circularly polarized wave. However, following current practice, we\nshall refer to positive helicity as right polarization R. The negative helicity state is represented by\nf~- = ( E~- + iB~-).\nActually, we have the alternative of associating f~-\n∗ = ( E~- - iB~-) with R and f~+\n∗ = ( E~+ - iB~+)\nwith L. However, we prefer the first choice and will use the added freedom in the formalism to\ndescribe the absorption and the emission process at a later stage 27\nMeanwhile, we turn to the discussion of polarization which has a number of interesting aspects,\nparticularly if carried out in the context of spinor algebra.\n27In the literature the Fourier decomposition of the field is usually written in terms of the vector potential rather\nthan in terms of E~ + iB~. The latter method, which alone leads naturally to a decomposition into helicity states, is\nconsidered by [Kra58], see page 86.\n\n5 Spinor Calculus\n5.1 From triads and Euler angles to spinors. A heuristic introduction.\nAs mentioned already in Section 3.4.3, it is an obvious idea to enrich the Pauli algebra formalism by\nintroducing the complex vector space V(2, C) on which the matrices operate. The two-component\ncomplex vectors are traditionally called spinors28. We wish to show that they give rise to a wide\nrange of applications. In fact we shall introduce the spinor concept as a natural answer to a problem\nthat arises in the context of rotational motion.\nIn Section 3 we have considered rotations as operations performed on a vector space. Whereas\nthis approach enabled us to give a group-theoretical definition of the magnetic field, a vector is\nnot an appropriate construct to account for the rotation of an orientable object. The simplest\nmathematical model suitable for this purpose is a Cartesian (orthogonal) three-frame, briefly, a\ntriad. The problem is to consider two triads with coinciding origins, and the rotation of the object\nframe is described with respect to the space frame. The triads are represented in terms of their\nrespective unit vectors: the space frame as Σs(ˆx1, xˆ2, xˆ3) and the object frame as Σc(ˆe1, eˆ2, eˆ3).\nHere c stands for \"corpus,\" since o for \"object\" seems ambiguous. We choose the frames to be\nright-handed.\nThese orientable objects are not pointlike, and their parametrization offers novel problems. In this\nsense we may refer to triads as \"higher objects,\" by contrast to points which are \"lower objects.\"\nThe thought that comes most easily to mind is to consider the nine direction cosines eˆi · xˆk but\nthis is impractical, because of the six relations connecting these parameters. This difficulty is\nremoved by the three independent Eulerian angles, a most ingenious set of constructs, which leave\nus nevertheless with another problem: these parameters do not have good algebraic properties; their\nconnection with the ordinary Euclidean vector space is provided by rather cumbersome relations.\nThis final difficulty is solved by the spinor concept.\nThe theory of the rotation of triads has been usually considered in the context of rigid body me\nchanics29 According to the traditional definition a rigid body is \"a collection of point particles\nkeeping rigid distances.\" Such a system does not lend itself to useful relativistic generalization 30.\nNor is this definition easily reconciled with the Heisenberg principle of uncertainty.\nSince the present discussion aims at applications to relativity and quantum mechanics, we hasten\n28In the literature the spinor concept has been introduced independently and in terms of conflicting conventions in\nnonrelativistic quantum mechanics on the one hand and in the relativistic theory on the other. The former is developed\nin the familiar bra-ket formalism, whereas the latter operates in terms of the contraction technique of tensor calculus.\nThe present discussion is unified and uses the bra-ket formalism throughout. Moreover, the latter is introduced on\npurely mathematical grounds without invoking a prior knowledge of quantum mechanics. Comparison with standard\nprocedures will be given as we go along.\n29See [Gol50], Chapter IV. For more detail: [KS65] The fundamental theory is contained in Volume I of this four\nvolume classic.\n30[Pau58], p. 132. Also [Fok49]\n\nto point out that we consider a triad as a precise mathematical model to deal with objects that are\norientable in space.\nAlthough we shall briefly consider the rigid body rotation in Section 5.2, the concept of rigidity in\nthe sense defined above is not essential in our argument.\nWe turn now to a heuristic argument that leads us in a natural fashion from triad rotation to the\nspinor concept.\nAccording to Euler's theorem any displacement of a rigid body fixed at a point O is equivalent to\na rotation around an axis through O. (See [Whi64], page 2.)\nThis theorem provides the justification to describe the orientational configuration of Σc in terms of\nthe unitary matrix in SU(2) that produces the configuration in question from the standard position\nin which the two frames coincide. Denoting the unitary unimodular matrices corresponding to two\nconfiguration by V1, V2 a transition between them is conveyed by an operator U\nV2 = UV1\n(5.1.1)\nLet\nφ\nφ\nV\n= cos 1 - i sin vˆ · ~σ\n= q01 - i~q · ~σ\n(5.1.2)\nHere q0, ~q are the so-called quaternion components, since the (-iσk) obey the commutation rules\nof the quaternion units ek: e1e2 = -e2e1 = e3. We have\n|V | = q0 + q~ = q0 + q1 + q2 + q3 = 1\n(5.1.3)\nThe Equations 5.1.1 - 5.1.3 can be given an elegant geometrical interpretation: q0, ~q are considered\nas the coordinates of a point on the three-dimensional unit hypersphere in four-dimensional space\nV(4, R). Thus the rotation of the triad is mapped on the rotation of this hypersphere. The operation\nleaves 5.1.3 invariant.\nThe formalism is that of elliptic geometry, a counterpart to the hyperbolic geometry in Minkowski\nspace 31.\nThis geometry implies a \"metric\": the \"distance\" of two displacements V1, and V2 is defined as\nφ1\nφ2\nφ1\nφ2\nTr(V2V 1) = cos\ncos\n+ sin\nsin\nvˆ1 · vˆ2\n(5.1.4)\nφ\n= cos\n= q10q20 + ~q1 · q~2\n(5.1.5)\n31[KS28],[Bla60]\n\nwhere φ is the angle of rotation carrying V1, into V2. Note the analogy with the hyperbolic formula\n3.4.67 in Section 3.4.3.\nWe have here an example for an interesting principle of geometry: a \"higher object\" in a lower\nspace can be often represented as a \"lower object,\" i.e., a point in a higher space. The \"higher\nobject\" is a triad in ordinary space V(3, R). It is represented as a point in the higher space V(4, R).\nWe shall see that this principle is instrumental in the intuitive interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nThe points in the abstract spaces of this theory are to be associated with complex objects in ordinary\nspace.\nAlthough the representation of the rotation operator U and the rotating object V in terms of the\nsame kind of parametrization can be considered a source of mathematical elegance, it also has a\nshortcoming. Rotating objects may exhibit a preferred intrinsic orientation, such as a figure axis,\nor the electron spin, for which there is no counterpart in Equations 5.1.1 and 5.1.3.\nThis situation is remedied by the following artifice. Let the figure axis point along the unit vector\neˆ3 that coincides in the standard position with xˆ3 Instead of generating the object matrix V in terms\nof single rotation, we consider the following standard sequence to be read from right to left, (see\nFigure 5.1):\nα\nβ\nγ\nU(ˆx3, )U(ˆx2, )U(ˆx3, ) = V (α, β, γ)\n(5.1.6)\nHere α, β, γ are the well known Euler angles, and the sequence of rotations is one of the variants\ntraditionally used for their definition.\nThe notation calls for explanation. We shall continue to use, as we did in Section 3, U(ˆu, φ/2)\nfor the 2 × 2 unitary matrix parametrized in terms of axis angle variables. We shall call this also\na uniaxial parametrization, to be distinguished from the biaxial parametrization of the unitary V\nmatrices in which both the spatial direction xˆ3, and the figure axis eˆ3, play a preferred role.\nIn Equation 5.1.6 the rotations are defined along axes specified in the space frame Σs. However, in\nthe course of each operation the axis is fixed in both frames. Thus it is merely a matter of another\nname (an alias I) to describe the operation (4) in Σc. We have then for the same unitary matrix\nγ\nβ\nα\nV (α, β, γ) = U(ˆe3, )U(ˆe2, )U(ˆe3, )\n(5.1.7)\nNote the inversion of the sequence of operations involving the rotations a and y. This relation\nis to be interpreted in the kinematic sense: the body frame moves from the initial orientation of\ncoincidence with Σs into the final position.\nThe equivalence of 5.1.6 and 5.1.7 can be recognized by geometrical intuition, or also by explicit\ntransformations between Σs and Σc. (See [Got66], p 268).\nIn the literature one often considers the sequence\nγ\nβ\nα\nU(ˆx 00\n3, )U(ˆx 0\n2, )U(ˆx3, )\n(5.1.8)\n\nwhere xˆ0\n2, and xˆ00\n3 are axis positions after the first and the second step respectively. This procedure\nseems to have the awkward property that the different rotations are performed in different spaces.\nOn closer inspection, however, one notices that Equation 5.1.8 differs only in notation from Equa\ntion 5.1.7. In the usual static interpretation eˆ1, eˆ2, eˆ3, is used only for the final configuration, and\nxˆ0\n2, xˆ00\n3 are introduced as auxiliary axes. If, in contrast, one looks at the object frame kinematically,\none realizes that at the instant of the particular rotations the following axes coincide:\nxˆ3 = ˆe3,\nxˆ0\n2 = eˆ2,\nxˆ00\n3 = eˆ3,\n(5.1.9)\nWe now write Equation 5.1.6 explicitly as\nα\nβ\nγ\nV (α, β, γ)\n= U(ˆx3, ) U(ˆx2, ) U(ˆx3, )\n(5.1.10)\n\n-iα/2\n-iγ/2\ne\ncos(β/2) - sin(β/2)\ne\n=\niα/2\niγ/2\ne\nsin(β/2)\ncos(β/2)\ne\n-iγ/2\niγ/2\ne-iα/2 cos(β/2)e\n-e-iα/2 sin(β/2)e\n=\n-iγ/2\niγ/2\neiα/2 sin(β/2)e\neiα/2 cos(β/2)e\n-ξ∗\n=\nξ0\nξ∗\nξ1\nwith\n-iγ/2\nξ0 = e -iα/2 cos(β/2)e\n-iγ/2\nξ1 = eiα/2 sin(β/2)e\n(5.1.11)\nThe four matrix elements appearing in this relation are the so-called Cayley-Klein parameters.\n(See Equation 3.4.43 in Section 3.4.2.)\nIt is a general property of the matrices of the algebra A2, that they can be represented either\nin terms of components or in terms of matrix elements. We have arrived at the conclusion that\nthe representation of a unitary matrix in terms of elements is suitable for the parametrization of\norientational configuration, while the rotation operator is represented in terms of components (axis\nangle variables).\nThere is one more step left to express this result most efficiently. We introduce the two-component\ncomplex vectors (spinors) of V(2, C) already mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. In partic\nular, we define two conjugate column vectors, or ket spinors:\n-ξ∗\n|ξi =\nξ0\n,\n|ξ i =\n(5.1.12)\nξ∗\nξ1\nand write the unitary V matrix symbolically as\nV = hξ| | |ξ i\n(5.1.13)\n\nWe define the corresponding bra vectors by splitting the Hermitian conjugate V horizontally into\nrow vectors:\n\nξ∗\nξ∗\nhξ|\nV + =\n=\n(5.1.14)\n-ξ1 ξ0\nhξ |\nor\nhξ| = (ξ0\n∗ , ξ1\n∗ ) ;\nhξ | = (-ξ1, ξ0)\n(5.1.15)\nThe condition of unitarity of V can be expressed as\nhξ|\nV +V\n=\n|ξi, |ξ i\n(5.1.16)\nhξ |\nhξ|ξi\nhξ|ξ i\n=\n=\n(5.1.17)\nhξ |ξi\nhξ |ξ i\nyielding at once the conditions of orthonormality\nhξ|ξi = hξ |ξ i = 1\n(5.1.18)\nhξ|ξ i = hξ |ξi = 0\nThese can be, of course, verified by direct calculation. The orthogonal spinors are also called\nconjugate spinors.\nWe see from these relations that our definition of spin conjugation is, indeed, a sensible one.\nHowever, the meaning of this concept is richer than the analogy with the ortho-normality relation\nin the real domain might suggest.\nFirst of all we express spin conjugation in terms of a matrix operation. The relation is nonlinear,\nas it involves the operation of complex conjugation K\nWe have\n\n0 -1\n|ξ i =\nK|ξi = -iσ2K|ξi\n(5.1.19)\nand\n\nhξ | = Khξ|\n= Khξ|iσ2\n(5.1.20)\n-1\nWe obtain from here\n|ξ i = -|ξi,\nhξ | = -hξ|\n(5.1.21)\nThe bar notation for spin conjugation suggests a connection with the complex reflection of the\nPauli algebra. We shall see that such a connection indeed exists. However, we have to remember\nthat, in contrast to Equation 5.1.21, complex reflection is involutive, i.e., its iteration is the identity\nA ᆵ= A.\n\nThe emergence of the negative sign in Equation 5.1.21 is a well known property of the spin func\ntion, however we have to defer the discussion of this intriguing fact for later.\nWe shall occasionally refer to spinors normalized according to Equation 5.1.18 as unitary spinors,\nin order to distinguish them from relativistic spinors normalized as hξ|ξi = k0 where k0 is the 0-th\ncomponent of a four-vector.\nLet us take a closer look at the connection between spinors and triads. In our heuristic procedure\nwe started with an object triad specified by three orthonormal unit vectors eˆ1, eˆ2, eˆ3 and arrived at\nan equivalent specification in terms of an associated spinor |ξi. Our task is now to start from the\nspinor and establish the corresponding triad in terms of its unit vectors. This is achieved by means\nof quadratic expressions.\nWe consider the so-called outer products\nξ0\n|ξihξ| =\n(ξ ∗ , ξ ∗ )\nξ1\nξ0ξ∗\nξ0ξ0\n∗\n=\n(5.1.22)\nξ1ξ0\n∗ ξ1ξ1\n∗\nand\nξ0\n|ξihξ | =\n(-ξ1, ξ0)\nξ1\nξ2\n-ξ0ξ1\n=\n(5.1.23)\n-ξ2\nξ0ξ1\nwhich can be considered as products of a 2 × 1 and 1 × 2 matrix.\nIn order to establish the connection with the unit vectors eˆk, we consider first the unit configuration\nin which the triads coincide: α = β = γ = 0, i.e.,\nξ0 = 1, ξ1 = 0 or |ξi =\n(5.1.24)\nwith\n\n|ξ i =\n(5.1.25)\nDenoting these spinors briefly as |1i and | 1i respectively, we obtain from 5.1.22 and 5.1.23\n|1ih1| =\n=\n(1 + σ3) =\n(1 + ˆx3 · ~σ)\n(5.1.26)\n|1ih 1| =\n=\n(σ1 + iσ2) =\n(ˆx1 + ixˆ2) · ~σ\n(5.1.27)\n\nLet V be the unitary matrix that carries the object frame from the unit position into Σc(ˆe1, eˆ2, eˆ3).\nSince V + = V -1 and V = V , we have\nV |1i = |ξi\nV |1 i = |ξ i\n(5.1.28)\nh1|V -1 = hξ|\nh1 |V -1 = hξ |\n(5.1.29)\nBy operating on 5.1.26 and 5.1.27 from left and right by V and V -1 respectively, we obtain\n|ξihξ| =\n(1 + ˆe3 · ~σ)\n(5.1.30)\n|ξihξ | =\n(ˆe1 + ieˆ2) · ~σ\n(5.1.31)\nand hence, by using Equation 3.4.13 of Section 3.4.2,\neˆ1 = Tr (|ξihξ|~σ) = hξ|~σ|ξi\n(5.1.32)\neˆ1 + ieˆ2 ≡ eˆ+ = Tr |ξihξ |~σ = hξ |~σ|ξi\n(5.1.33)\nWe have used here the rule:\nTr(|ξihη|) = hη|ξi\n(5.1.34)\nEquations 5.1.32 and 5.1.33 constitute a most compact expression for the relation between a spinor\nand its associated triad. One can extract from here the values of the direction cosines\neˆj · xˆk ≡ ejk\nj, k = 1, 2, 3\n(5.1.35)\neˆ31 = hξ|σ1|ξi = ξ0ξ1\n∗ + ξ0\n∗ ξ1 = <(ξ0\n∗ ξ1)\n(a)\neˆ32 = hξ|σ2|ξi = i(ξ0ξ1\n∗ - ξ0\n∗ ξ1) = =(ξ0\n∗ ξ1)\n(b)\n(5.1.36)\neˆ33 = hξ|σ3|ξi = ξ0ξ0\n∗ + ξ1\n∗ ξ1\n(c)\neˆ11 + ieˆ21 = hξ |σ1|ξi = ξ0\n2 - ξ1\n(a)\neˆ12 + ieˆ22 = hξ |σ2|ξi = i(ξ0\n2 + ξ1\n2)\n(b)\n(5.1.37)\neˆ13 + ieˆ23 = hξ |σ3|ξi = -2ξ0ξ1\n(c)\nBy using Equation 5.1.11 we obtain these quantities in terms of Euler angles 32:\n= sin β cos α\ne32 = sin β sin α\n(5.1.38)\ne33 =\ne31\ncos β\n32Equations 5.1.38 and 5.1.39 are the standard formulas connecting the Cartesian and the spherical coordinates of\na unit vector. This was our rationale for choosing in Equation 5.1.6 U(ˆx2, β/2) rather than U(ˆx1, β/2) which would\nhave interchanged the role of cos α and sin α. (See [Gol50], op. cit. )\n\ne11 = cos γ cos β cos α - sin γ sin α\ne21 = - sin γ cos β cos α - cos γ sin α\ne12 = cos γ cos β sin α + sin γ cos α\ne22 = - sin γ cos β sin α + cos γ cos α (5.1.39)\ne13 = - cos γ sin β\ne23 = sin γ sin β\nThe relation between vectors and spinors displayed in Equations 5.1.36 can be established also by\nmeans of a stereographic projection33. This method yields quicker results than the present lengthy\nbuild-up which in turn has a wider scope. Instead of rotating vector spaces, we operate on triads\nand thus obtain also Equation 5.1.37. To my knowledge, this relation has not appeared in the\nliterature.\nThe Equations 5.1.36 and 5.1.37 solve the parametrization problem stated at the beginning of this\nchapter. The nine interrelated direction cosines ejk. are expressed by the three independent spinor\nparameters.\nThis is the counterpart of the parametrization problem concerning the nine parameters of the SO(3)\nmatrices (see page 13), a problem that has been solved by the SU(2) representation of SO(3) with\nthe unitary matrices U(ˆu, φ/2).\nIt is noteworthy that the decisive step was taken in both cases by Euler who introduced the \"Euler\nangles\" α, β, γ and also the axis-angle parameters ˆu, φ for the rotation operators.\nEuler's results come to fruition in the version of spinor calculus in which spinors representing\norientational states are parametrized in terms of Euler angles and the unitary operators in terms of\nˆu, φ.\nWe propose to demonstrate the ease by which this formalism lends itself to algebraic operations.\nThis stems particularly from the constructs 5.1.30 and 5.1.31 in which we recognize the singular\nmatrices of Table 3.2 (page 46).\nWe define more fully\n|ξihξ| =\n(1 + ˆe3 · ~σ) ≡ E3\n(a)\n|ξ ihξ | =\n(1 - eˆ3 · ~σ) ≡ E 3\n(b)\n|ξihξ | =\n(ˆe1 + ieˆ2) · ~σ ≡ E+\n(c)\n|ξ ihξ| =\n(ˆe1 - ieˆ2) · ~σ ≡ E- = -E +\n(d)\n(5.1.40)\n\nHere E3, E3 are idempotent projection operators and E+, E- nilpotent step operators. Since E3 +\nE3 = 1, we have\n|ηi = |ξihξ|ηi + |ξ ihξ |ηi\n(5.1.41)\n= |ξia0 + |ξ ia1\n(5.1.42)\n33The surface of the unit sphere is projected from the south pole on to the equatorial plane; the latter is considered\nthe complex plane in terms of homogeneous coordinates z = ξ1/ξ0. See [Wey50], page 144.\n\nwith\na0 = hξ|ηi,\na1 = hξ |ηi\n(5.1.43)\nAlso\nE+|ξ i = |ξi\nE-|ξi = |ξ i\n(5.1.44)\nE+|ξi = 0\nE-|ξ i = 0\n(5.1.45)\nWe see from Equations 5.1.40 that the transition |ξi →|ξ i corresponds to an inversion of the figure\naxis with a simultaneous inversion of the γ-rotation around the axis. Therefore the transformation\ncorresponds to a transition from a right to a left frame with a simultaneous change from counter\nclockwise to clockwise as the positive sense of rotation. Thus we should look at the transition from\n\n5.1.40c to 5.1.40d as E+ → E+, or\n(ˆe1 + ieˆ2) · ~σ →\n[-eˆ1 - i(-eˆ2)] · ~σ\n(5.1.46)\nAll this is apparent also if we represent the transition |ξi →|ξ i in terms of Euler angles as\nα → π + α\n(5.1.47)\nβ → π - β\n(5.1.48)\nγ → π - γ\n(5.1.49)\nWe note also the following relations for later use:\n\nE-E+ = E3,\nE+E- = E3\n(5.1.50)\nIn addition to the short symbols |ξi, |ξ i for spinors and their conjugates, we shall use also more\nexplicit notations depending on the context:\n|α, β, γi = |π + α, π - β, π - γi\n(5.1.51)\n|ˆ\n| - ˆ\n(5.1.52)\nk, γi, |k, γ\nˆ\ni =\nk, π - γi\n\n|kˆi | kˆi = | - kˆi\n(5.1.53)\nHere kˆ is the unit vector denoted by eˆ3, in Equation 5.1.30. Its association with the spinor is evident\nfrom the following eigenvalue problem.\nBy using Equations 5.1.40 and 5.1.18 we obtain\n1 1 + kˆ · ~σ |kˆi = |kˆihkˆ|kˆi = |kˆi\n(5.1.54)\n\n1 - kˆ · ~σ |kˆi = |kˆihkˆ|kˆi = |kˆi\n(5.1.55)\n\nHence\nkˆ · ~σ|ˆik = |kˆi\n(5.1.56)\nkˆ · ~σ|ˆik = |kˆi\n(5.1.57)\nˆ\nThus |ki and |ki are eigenvectors of the Hermitian operator kˆ · ~σ, with the eigenvalues +1 and\n-1 respectively. This is a well known result, although usually obtained by a somewhat longer\ncomputation34.\nBy using the explicit expression for U(ˆk, φ/2) we obtain from 5.1.56 and 5.1.57:\nU(k, φ/\nˆ\n2)|k, γ\nˆ\ni = exp (-iφ/2) |ˆ\nk, γ + φi\nk, γi = |ˆ\n(5.1.58)\nU(k, φ/\nˆ\n2)|k, γ\nˆ\ni = exp (iφ/2) |ˆ\nk, γ + φi\nk, γi = |ˆ\n(5.1.59)\nThere is also the unitary diagonal matrix\n-iφ/2\nU(ˆx3, φ/2) =\ne\n(5.1.60)\n-iφ/2\ne\nthe effect of which is easily described:\nU(ˆx3, φ/2)|α, β, γi = |α + φ, β, γi\n(5.1.61)\nThese relations bring out the \"biaxial\" character of spinors: both xˆ3, and kˆ play a distinguished\nrole. The same is true of a unitary matrix parametrized in terms of Euler angles: V (α, β, γ) or\nCayley-Klein parameters. This is to be contrasted with the uniaxial form U(ˆu, φ/2).\nOur discussion in this chapter has been thus far purely geometrical although active transformations\nof geometrical objects can be given a kinematic interpretation. We go now one step further and\nintroduce the conept of time. By setting φ = ωt with a constant ω in the unitary rotation operator\nwe obtain the description of rotation processes:\nωt\nγ\nγ\nγ + ωt\nU(k,\nˆ\n)|ˆ\ni = exp (-iωt/2) |ˆ\ni = |ˆ\ni\nk,\nk,\nk,\n(5.1.62)\nωt\nγ + ωt\nU(ˆ\n)|ˆ\n=\nk, γi = |ˆ\ni\nk,\nk, γi\nexp (iωt/2) |ˆ\nk,\nThese rotations are stationary, because U operates on its eigenspinors. There are various ways to\nrepresent the evolution of arbitrary spinors as well. We have\nωt\nωt ˆ\nU(k,\nˆ\n)|ηi = exp -i\nk · ~σ |ηi\n(5.1.63)\nωt\nωt ˆ\nhη|U -1(k,\nˆ\n)\n= hη| exp i\nk · ~σ\n34See [Kae65], pp. 11-16. This is a highly recommended supplementary reading.\n\nOr, in differential form\nω ˆ\ni|η i =\nk · ~σ|ηi\n(5.1.64)\n2 ω ˆ\n-ihη | = hη| k · ~σ\nThe state functions solving these differential equations are obtained explicitly by using Equa\ntions 5.1.42, 5.1.43, 5.1.62 and 5.1.63:\nωt\nˆ\nˆ\n|η(t)i = U k,\n|η(0)i = exp (-iωt/2) |kˆia0 + exp (iωt/2) |kia1\n(5.1.65)\nand similarly for hη(t)|.\nBy introducing the symbol H for the Hermitian operator H = (ωt/2)kˆ · ~σ in 5.1.64 we obtain\ni|η i = H|ηi\n(5.1.66)\n-ihη | = hη|H\n(5.1.67)\nThese equations are reminiscent of the Schr odinger equation. Also it would be easy to derive from\nhere a Heisenberg type operator equation.\nIt must be apparent to those familiar with quantum mechanics, that our entire spinor formalism has\na markedly quantum mechanical flavor. What all this means is that the orientability of objects is\nof prime importance in quantum mechanics and the concept of the triad provides us with a more\ndirect path to quantization, or to some aspects of it, than the traditional point mass approach.\nIn order to make use of this opportunity, we have to apply our spinor formalism to physical systems.\nOur use of the concept of time in Equations 5.1.62-5.1.66 is quite formal. We merely selected a\none-parameter subgroup of the rotation group to describe possible types of stationary rotation.\nWe have to turn to experiment, or to an experimentally established dynamical theory, to decide\nwhether such motions actually occur in nature. We shall examine this question in connection with\nthe rigid body rotation in the next section.\nHowever, our main objective is the discussion of polarized light. Here the connection between\nclassical and quantum theories is very close and the quantization procedure is particularly clear in\nterms of the spinor formalism.\nThe fact that the same formalism can be adjusted both to rigid body motion and to a wave phe\nnomenon is interesting by itself. We know that the particle-wave duality is among the central\nthemes in quantum mechanics. The contrast between these objects is very pronounced if we con\nfine ourselves to point particles and to scalar waves. It is remarkable how this contrast is toned\ndown within the context of rotational problems.\n\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5.1: Euler Angles: (a) Static Picture. (b) Kinematic Display.\n\n5.2 Rigid Body Rotation 35\nIn Equations 5.1.62-5.1.65 we have introduced the concept of time formally as a parameter to\nspecify some simple types of motion which have a stationary character.\nWe examine now the usefulness of these results by considering the inertial motions of a rigid body\nfixed at one of its points, the so-called gyroscope.\nWe may sum up the relevant experimental facts as follows: there are objects of a sufficiently high\nsymmetry (the spherical top) that indeed display a stationary, inertial rotation around any of their\naxes. In the general case (asymmetric top) such a stationary rotation is possible only around three\nprincipal directions marked out in the body triad.\nThe point of greatest interest for us, however, is the fact that there are also modes of motion that\ncan be considered stationary in a weaker sense of the word.\nWe mean the so-called precession. We shall consider here only the regular precession of the sym\nmetric top, or gyroscope, 36 that can be visualized in terms of the well known geometrical con\nstruction developed by Poinsot in 1853. The motion is produced by letting a circular cone fixed in\nthe body triad Σc roll over a circular cone fixed in the space triad Σs (see Figure 5.2) 37.\nThe noteworthy point is that the biaxial nature of spinors renders them well suited to provide an\nalgebraic counterpart to this geometric picture.\nIn order to prove this point we have to make use of the theorem that angular velocities around\ndifferent axes can be added according to the rules of vectorial addition. This theorem is a simple\ncorollary of our formalism.\nLet us consider the composition of infinitesimal rotations with δφ = ωδt << 1:\n\nU2(ˆu2, ω2δt\n2 )U1(ˆu1, ω1δt\n2 ) '\n1 - ω2δt\n2 ˆu2 · ~σ\n1 - ω1δt\n2 ˆu1 · ~σ\n(5.2.1)\n' 1 - δt\n2 (ω2 ˆu2 + ω1 ˆu1) · ~σ\n(5.2.2)\nWe define the angular velocity vectors\n~ω = ωuˆ\n(5.2.3)\nand notice from Equation 5.2.1 that\n~\nω2 = ~\n(5.2.4)\nω1 + ~\nω\n35Section 5.2 is not required for the continuity of the argument.\n36The principal moments of inertia are I1 = I2 =6\nI3, and the external torque N = 0.\n37See for a detailed geometrical discussion of the various possibilities in Klein-Sommerfeld [KS65]. Although\nmany aspects of the spinor concept are found at least implicitly in this work, the formalism was not carried far enough\nto include the spinorial representation of the Poinsot precession.\n\nConsequently we obtain for the situation presented in Figure 5.2:\n~\n= γˆ\nαˆ\n(5.2.5)\nω\ne3 + x3\nω2 = α 2 + γ2 + 2 αγ cos β\n(5.2.6)\nβ = xˆ3 · eˆ3\n(5.2.7)\nWe can describe the precession in spinorial terms as follows. We describe the gyroscope configu\nration in terms of the unitary matrix 5.1.10 and operate on it from right and left with two unitary\noperators:\nαt\n\nγt\nV (t)\n= U(ˆx3,\n)V (0)U(ˆe3,\n)\n(5.2.8)\n\n-iαt/\n\n-iγ(0)/2\niγ(0)/2\ne\ne-iα(0)/2 cos(β/2)e\n-e-iα(0)/2 sin(β/2)e\n=\niαt/\n\n-iγ(0)/2\niγ(0)/2\ne\neiα(0)/2 sin(β/2)e\neiα(0)/2 cos(β/2)e\n-i γt/2\ne\n×\ni γt/2\ne\nThus\nα = α(0) + αt,\nγ = γ(0) + γt\n(5.2.9)\nThis relation displays graphically the biaxial character of the V matrix. Thus premultiplication\ncorresponds to rotation in Σs and postmultiplication to that in Σc.\nNote that the situations represented in Figure 5.2 (a) and (b) are called progressive and retrograde\nprecessions respectively.\nThe rotational axis ~ω is instantaneously at rest in both frames. The vector components can be\nexpressed as follows:\n=Σs\n(a) ω1 = γ sin β cos α\n(b) ω2 = γ sin β sin α\n(a) ω3 = γ cos β + α\n=Σc\nω1 = α sin β cos γ\n(5.2.10)\nω2 = α sin β sin γ\nω3 = α cos β + γ\nThese expressions can be derived formally from Equation 5.2.8. The left column of Equation 5.2.10\nfollows from the application of the left-operator on a ket spinor and the right column of Equa\ntion 5.2.10 from a right operation on a bra spinor.\nAnother way of arriving at these results is as follows: Expressions in the left column of Equa\ntion 5.2.10 are evident from the vector addition rule given in 5.2.4. Expressions in the right column\nof Equation 5.2.10 do not follow so easily from geometrical intuition. However, we can invoke the\nkinematic relativity between the two triads. A rotation of Σc with respect to Σs can be thought of\nalso as the reverse rotation of Σs in Σc. Thus Vc is equivalent to\nV -1 = V +\ns\ns = Vs(-α, -β, -γ)\n(5.2.11)\n\nand we arrive from left to the right columns in Equation 5.2.10 by the following substitution:\nα →\n-γ\n(5.2.12)\nβ →\n-β\n(5.2.13)\nγ →\n-α\n(5.2.14)\nt →\n-t\n(5.2.15)\n(5.2.16)\nUp to this point the discussion has been only descriptive, kinematic. We have to turn to dynamics\nto answer the deeper questions as to the factors that determine the nature of the precession in any\nparticular instance.\nWe invoke the kinematic relation Equation 5.1.62:\nωt\nγ\nωt\nγ\nexp -i\nˆ σ\nk, i = exp -i\nk, i\n(5.2.17)\nk · ~\n|ˆ\n|ˆ\nThis expression offers a way of generalization to dynamics. If this relation indeed describes a\nstationary process, then the generators 2\ni σj of the unitary operator are constants of that motion.\nLater we shall pursue this idea to establish the concept of angular momentum and its quantization.\nHowever, at this preliminary stage we are merely looking for an elementary illustration of the\nformalism, and we draw on the standard results of rigid body dynamics.\nThe dynamic law consists of three propositions. First, we have in Σs\ndL~ s = N~\n(5.2.18)\ndt\nwhere N is the external torque.\nIn Σc we have a constitutive relation connecting angular velocity and angular momentum. We\nassume that the object triad is along the principal axes of inertia:\nLc1 = I1ω1\nLc2 = I2ω2\n(5.2.19)\nLc3 = I3ω3\nFinally, the angular momentum components in Σs and Σc are connected by the relation\ndL~ s\ndL~ c\n=\n+ ~ω × L~ c\n(5.2.20)\ndt\ndt\nEquations 5.2.18-5.2.20 imply the Euler equations. Dynamically the precession may stem either\nfrom an external torque, or from the anisotropy of the moment of inertia (or both).\n\nWe shall assume N~ = 0 and I1 = I2 6= I3. The Euler equations simplified accordingly yield for\nthe precession as viewed in Σc :\nω c1 + iω c2 = -i (ωc1 + iωc2) ω3δ\n(5.2.21)\nI3ω 3 =\nwith\nI3\nδ = 1 -\n(5.2.22)\nI1\nFrom Equation 5.2.10, right hand column, row (a) and (b), we obtain\nω 1 + iω 2 = -iγ (ω1 + iω2)\n(5.2.23)\nand by comparison with 5.2.21 we have\nI3\nγ = ω3δ = ω3 1 -\n(5.2.24)\nI1\nWe obtain from 5.2.24, 5.2.22 and 5.2.10 (the right hand column, row c):\nI3ω3 = I1α cos β\n(5.2.25)\nand\nγ\nI1\n=\n- 1\n(5.2.26)\nα cos β\nI3\nThus the nature of inertial precession is determined by the inertial anisotropy 5.2.22. In particular,\nlet cos β > 0, then\nγ\nI1 > I3 →\n> 0 see Figure 5.2-a\n(5.2.27)\nα\nγ\nI1 < I3 →\n< 0 see Figure 5.2-b\n(5.2.28)\nα\nFinally, from Equation 5.2.25 Lc3 = I3ω3 = I1α cos β and the total angular momentum squared is\nL2 = I1\n2α 2\n(5.2.29)\nNote that Lc3 = I1α cos β is the projection of the total angular momentum on to the figure axis.\nThe precession γ in Σc comes about if I3 =6\nI1. For further detail we refer to [KS65].\nWe note also that Euler's theory has been translated into the modern language of Lie Groups by V.\nArnold ([Arn66] pp 319-361). However in this work stationary motions are required to have fixed\nrotational axes.\n\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5.2: Progressive (a) and Retrograde (b) Precession.\n\n5.3 Polarized light\nPolarization optics provides a most appropriate field of application for the Pauli algebra and the\nspinor formalism. Historically, of course, it went the other way around, and various aspects of the\nformalism had been advanced by many authors, often through independent discovery in response\nto a practical need38.\nIn the present discussion we forego the historical approach and by using the mathematical for\nmalism already developed, we arrive at the consolidation and streamlining of much disconnected\nmaterial.\nAnother factor which simplifies our argument is that we do not attempt to describe polarization\nin all the complexity of a real situation, but concentrate first on a simple mathematical model,\nthe two-dimensional isotropic, harmonic oscillator. This is, of course, the standard method of the\nelementary theory, however, by translating this description into the spinorial formalism, we set the\nstage for generalizations. A potential generalization would be to establish the connection with the\nstatistical theory of coherence39. However, at the present stage we shall be more concerned with\napplications to quantum mechanics40.\nLet us consider a monochromatic, polarized plane wave propagating in the z direction and write\nfor the x and y components of the electric field\nEx = p1 cos(ωt + φ1) = p1 cos τ\n(5.3.1)\nEy = p2 cos(ωt + φ2) = p2 cos(τ - φ)\nwhere\nφ = φ1 - φ2,\np1, p2 ≥ 0\n(5.3.2)\nLet us define new parameters:\nθ\np1 = p cos 2\n0 ≤ θ ≤ π\n(5.3.3)\nθ\np2 = p sin 2\nIt is convenient to express the information contained in Equations 5.3.1-5.3.3 in terms of the spinor\n-iφ/2\ne\ncos(θ/2)\n-iψ/2\n|kˆi = p\niφ/2\ne\n(5.3.4)\ne\nsin(θ/2)\n38[Sto52]; [Poi92]; See [Shu62], with an extensive bibliography. Closest in line with the present approach is\n[Whi71]. This paper contains also a selection of references to theoretical papers.\n39[Wie30, Bar63]\n40Such connections may have been first suggested by [FM51, Fan51, Fan54]\n\nHere ψ = ωt + φ1 represents the common phase of the two components which does not affect\nthe state of polarization. However, the presence of this third angle is in line with our definition\nof spinor in Equations 5.1.10 and 5.1.11 in Section 5.1. It will prove to be of significance in the\nproblem of beam splitting and composition. By normalizing the intensity and setting p = 1, the\nspinor 5.3.4 conforms to our unitary normalization of Section 5.1 41.\nBy using Equations 5.1.30, 5.1.36 and 5.1.38 of Section 5.1 we obtain\n|kˆihkˆ| = (1 + kˆ · ~σ)\n(5.3.5)\nwith\nk1 = hkˆ|σ1|kˆi = sin θ cos φ = 2p1p2 cos φ\nk2 = hkˆ|σ2|kˆi = sin θ sin φ = 2p1p2 sin φ\n(5.3.6)\nk3 = hkˆ|σ3|kˆi = cos θ = p 2 - p 2\nIn such a fashion the spinor 5.3.5, and hence each state of polarization is mapped on the surface of\nthe unit sphere, the so-called Poincar e sphere.\nWe see that the unit vector (1, 0, 0)(θ = π/2, φ = 0) corresponds to linear polarization along\n√ (ˆx + ˆy) ,\nor |45*i\n(0, 1, 0)(θ = π/2, φ = π/2) corresponds to right circularly polarized light |Ri42, and (0, 0, 1) or\nθ = 0 to linear polarization in the xˆ direction: |xˆi. (See Figures 5.3 and 5.3.)\nThere is an alternative, and even more favored method of parametrizing the Poincar e sphere, in\nwhich the preferred axis for the definition of spherical coordinates corresponds to light of positive\nhelicity |Ri. This choice implies a new set of spherical angles, say α, β to replace φ, θ. Their\nrelation is displayed geometrically in Figures 5.3 and 5.4. The corresponding algebraic treatment\nis summed up as follows.\nWe relabel the Cartesian axes in the \"Poincar e space\" as\nk3 = s1 = sin β cos α\nk1 = s2 = sin β sin α\n(5.3.7)\nk2 = s3 = cos β\n41This is a good opportunity to amend an unnecessary narrowness in the definition of the spinor in Section 5.1.\n\"Spinor\" should denote any vector in V(2, C). The unitary normalization is required only for the basis spinors or unit\nspinors.\n42Contrary to the traditional convention in classical optics we call right polarization light of positive helicity: linear\nand angular momentum are parallel. Note that left polarization is the conjugate of right polarization: |Li = |R i;\nlikewise |y ˆi = |x ˆi, and |135*i = |45*i.\n\nX\nThe vector sˆ is associated with the unitary spinor\nexp(-iα/2) cos(β/2)\n|sˆi =\n(5.3.8)\nexp(iα/2)\nsin(β/2)\nand\n|sˆihsˆ| = (1 + ˆs · σ)\n(5.3.9)\nThe advantage of this choice is that the angles α, β have a simple meaning. We claim that\n1 π\na1 = a cos\n( - β)\n(5.3.10)\n2 2\n1 π\na2 = a sin\n( - β)\n2 2\nwhere a1, a2 are the half major and minor axes of the ellipse traced by the E~ vector; we associate\na positive and negative a2 with an ellipse circled in the positive and negative sense respectively.\nMoreover, the angle α is twice the angle of inclination of the major axis against the x axis (Fig\nure 5.4-d). The angle γ refers to the overall phase in complete analogy to ψ.\nThe proof of these statements are found in Born and Wolf (see pp. 24-32 of [BW64], the later\neditions are almost unchanged). A somewhat simplified derivation follows.\nFirst we prove that Equations 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 provide indeed a parametric representation of an\nellipse. The elimination of τ from the two equations 5.3.1 yields\n\nE1\n2E1E2 cos φ\nE2\n-\n+\n= 1\n(5.3.11)\np1 sin φ\np1p2 sin2 φ\np2 sin φ\nThis is an equation of the form\naikxixk = 1\n(5.3.12)\ni=1\nwith the aik, real, symmetric, and a11 > 0,\na11a22 - a12\n2 > 0\n(5.3.13)\nThe axes of the ellipse are derived from the eigenvalue problem:\n(a11 - λ)x1 + a12x2 = 0\n(5.3.14)\na21x1 + (a22 - λ)x2 = 0\nHence\nλ2 - (a11 + a22)λ + a11a22 - a12 = 0\n(5.3.15)\n\nwith\nλ1 =\n2 ,\nλ2 =\n(5.3.16)\na\na\nwhere a1, a2 are the half major and half minor axes respectively.\nWe have, by inserting for the aik, from Equation 5.3.11\nλ1 + λ1 = a11 + a22 =\n2 +\n(5.3.17)\np1\np2\nsin2 φ\nλ1 + λ1 = a11a22 - a12 =\n(5.3.18)\np1p2\n2 sin2 φ\nFrom these equations we have\n2 2\na 1a2 = p1p2 sin2 φ\n(5.3.19)\na1 + a2 = p1 + p2\n(5.3.20)\nFrom Equation 5.3.19 we have a1a2 = ±p1p2 sin φ. We require\na1a2 = p1p2 sin φ\n(5.3.21)\nand let a2 < 0 for sinφ < 0.\nWe introduce now the auxiliary angle 3 as defined in Equation 5.3.10. With such an assignment\nβ = 0, π correspond indeed to right and left circularly polarized light |Ri, |R i respectively. More\nover a1 ≥|a2|. Hence a1 is the half major axis.\nFrom Equations 5.3.3, 5.3.19 and 5.3.10 we obtain\ncos β = sin θ sin φ\n(5.3.22)\nWe complete the parametrization of ellipticity by introducing α/2 for the angle between the major\naxis43 and the xˆ direction (Figure 5.4-c).\nFrom Equation 5.3.14 we have\nα\nx2\nλ - a11\na12\ntan\n=\n=\n=\n(5.3.23)\nx1\na12\nλ - a22\nand\nα\nα\nλ-a11\na12\ntan + tan\n+\na12\nλ-a22\ntan α =\n=\nλ-a11\n1 - tan2 α\nλ-a22\n(λ - a11)(λ - a22) 1 + a12\n2a12\n=\na12\n=\na11 - a22\na11 - a22\n2p1p2 cos φ\nsin θ cos φ\n=\n=\n= tan θ cos φ\n(5.3.24)\np1 - p2\ncos θ\n43That α/2 refers to the major rather than the minor axis will be evident from the resulting parametrization of the\nPoincar e sphere.\n\nIt is apparent from Equation 5.3.22 that the axis s3 can be indeed identified with k2. Moreover\nEquation 5.3.24 yields\ns2\nk1\n=\n(5.3.25)\ns1\nk3\nSince k 2\n1 + k 2\n2 + k 2\n3 = 1 = s 2\n1 = s 2\n2 = s 2\n3, we arrive at the rest of the identification suggested in\nEquation 5.3.7.\nWe shall refer to the formalism based on the parametrizations kˆ(φ, θ, ψ) and sˆ(α, β, γ) as the kˆ\nscheme and the sˆ-scheme respectively. Since either of the two pairs of angles φ, θ and α, β provide\na satisfactory description of the polarization state, it is worthwhile to deal with both schemes.\nThe role of the \"third angle\" ψ or γ, respectively, is more subtle. It is well known that a spinor\ncan be visualized as a vector and an angle, a \"flagpole\" and a \"flag\" in Penrose's terminology 44.\nHowever, the angle represents a phase, and as such has notoriously ambivalent properties. While a\nsingle phase is usually unimportant, phase relations are often most significant. Although one can\nsolve particular problems in polarization optics in terms of the Poincar e sphere without an explicit\nuse of the third angle, for us these problems are merely stepping stones for deeper problems and\nwe prefer to present them as instances of the general formalism. No matter if this seems to be a\nsomewhat heavy gun for the purpose.\nIn proceeding this way we have to ignore some fine distinctions; thus we assign |ξi and -|ξi to the\nsame state of polarization. We consider it an advantage that the formalism has the reserve capacity\nto be used later to such problems as the electron spin45.\nWe demonstrate the usefulness of the spinor formalism by translating one of its simple propositions\ninto, what might be called the fundamental theorem of polarization optics.\nConsider two pairs of conjugate spinors |ξi, |ξ i and |ξ0i, |ξ 0i.\nTheorem 3. There is a uniquely determined unimodular unitary matrix U such that\n|ξ0i = U|ξi\n(5.3.26)\n|ξ 0i = U|ξ i\nProof. By using Equation 5.1.27 of Section 5.1 we consider the unitary matrices associated with\nthe spinor pairs:\nV\n=\n|ξi, |ξ i\n(5.3.27)\nV 0 =\n|ξ0i, |ξ 0i\n(5.3.28)\n44See [MTW73], p 1157. The equivalent term \"ax and blade\" has been used by [Pay52]. A number of ideas in the\npresent version of spinor theory have been advanced in this paper and its sequels by the same author: [Pay55, Pay59].\n45Remember that in Section 3 we use the SU(2) representation of SO(3), not because we need its two-valuedness,\nbut because it offers an economical and adequate parametrization of the problem.\n\nThe matrix U = V 0V -1 has the desired properties, since UV = V 0 .\nLet the monoaxial parametrization of U be U(ˆu, χ/2) . By using Equations 5.1.58 and 5.1.59 of\nSection 5.1 we see that U has two eigenspinors:\nU|uˆi = exp (-iχ/2) |uˆi\n(5.3.29)\nU|u ˆi = exp (iχ/2) |u ˆi\n(5.3.30)\nHence U produces a phase shift between the conjugate states |uˆi and |u ˆi; moreover it rotates their\nlinear combinations:\n|ξi = a0|uˆi + a1|uˆ i\n(5.3.31)\nwhere\n|a0|2 + |a1|2 = 1\n(5.3.32)\nThese results translate into polarization optics as follows. An arbitrary, fully polarized beam can be\ntransformed into another beam of the same kind by a phase shifter, the axis uˆ of which is uniquely\ndetermined in terms of the spinor representation of the given beams. Since the result is a rotation\nof the Poincar e sphere, the axis of the phase shifter can be determined also geometrically.\nTo counteract the complete generality of the Poincar e construction, let us consider the special cases\nU = U\nkˆ3, Δφ\n(5.3.33)\nΔα\nU = U\nsˆ3,\n(5.3.34)\nThe phase shifter, Equation 5.3.33, is called a linear retarder, it establishes a phase lag between\none state of linear polarization and its antipodal state. For Δφ = π/2 we have a quarter waveplate\nthat transforms elliptic into linear polarization or vice versa.\nThe phase shifter, Equation 5.3.34, produces a phase lag between right and left circularly polarized\nbeams. (A circularly biregringent crystal, say quartz is cut perpendicularly to the optic axis: spiral\nstaircase effect.)\nSince a linearly polarized beam is the linear composition |Ri and |Li the phase lag manifests itself\nin a rotation of the plane of polarization, hence a rotation around sˆ3. The device is called a rotator.\nThus rotations of the Poincar e sphere may produce either a change of shape, or a change of orien\ntation in ordinary space.\nWe may add that by combining two quarter waveplates with one general rotator we can realize an\narbitrary phase shifter U(ˆu, χ/2).\nOur main theorem on the representation of the transformation of fully polarized beams is evidently\nthe counterpart of Euler's theorem on the displacements of the gyroscope mentioned on page 56.\n\nAlthough we have a formal identity, in the sense that we have in both cases the rotation of a triad,\nthere is a great deal of difference in the physical interpretation. The rotation takes place now in an\nabstract space, we may call it the Poincar e space. Also it makes a great deal of difference that the\nangular velocities of the rotating object are now replaced by the time rates of change of the phase\ndifference between pairs of conjugate polarizations. On going from rigid bodies to polarized waves\n(degenerate vibrations) we do not have to modify the formalism, but the new interpretation opens\nup new opportunities. The concept of phase difference evokes the idea of coherent superposition as\ncontrasted with incoherent composition. These matters have no analog in the case of rigid rotation,\nand we now turn to the examination of the new features.\nLet us consider a polarized beam represented in the sˆ(α, β) scheme by the spinor |sˆi where\nS = |sˆihsˆ| = (1 + ˆs · ~σ)\n(5.3.35)\nor alternatively\ns0s ∗ s0s ∗\nS =\n(5.3.36)\ns1s ∗ s0s ∗\nS is called the density matrix or coherency matrix associated with a polarized beam (a pure state\nin quantum mechanics). As we have seen already, it is idempotent and the determinant |S| = 0.\nWe analyze this beam with an instrument U(u, Δψ/2) where uˆ 6= sˆ, and obtain\n|sˆi = a0|uˆi + a1|u ˆi\n(5.3.37)\nwith\na0 = huˆ|sˆi\na1 = huˆ |sˆi\n(5.3.38)\n|a0|2 + |a1|2\n=\n(5.3.39)\nFrom Equations 5.1.58 and 5.1.58 we have\nΔψ\n|ξ0i = U\nˆ\n|ˆ\nu,\nsi +\nΔψ\nΔψ\n= a0 exp -i\n|uˆia1 exp i\n|u ˆi\nψ + Δψ\nψ + Δψ\n= a0|ˆ\ni + a1|ˆ\ni\n(5.3.40)\nu,\nu,\nLet us now assume that the instrument U is doubled up with a reverse instrument that reunites the\ntwo beams that have been separated in the first step. This reunification may happen after certain\nmanipulations have been performed on the separated beams. Such a device, the so-called analyzing\nloop has been used more for the conceptual analysis of the quantum mechanical formalism than\nfor the practical purposes of polarization optics.\n\nDepending on the nature of the manipulations we have a number of distinct situations which we\nproceed to disentangle on hand of the following formulas.\nWe obtain from Equation 5.3.40\n1 S0 = |sˆ0ihsˆ0| = |a0|2|uˆihuˆ| + |a1|2|u ˆihu ˆ| + a0a ∗\n1 exp (-iΔψ) |uˆihu ˆ|\n(5.3.41)\nHere S0 is idempotent and of determinant zero just as S is, since |sˆ0i arises out of |sˆi by means of\na unitary operation.\nLet us consider now a different case in which the phase difference between the two partial beams\nhas been randomized. In fact, take first the extreme case in which the interference terms vanish:\nha0a1\n∗ exp (-iΔψ)iav = ha1a0\n∗ exp (iΔψ)iav = 0\n(5.3.42)\nWe obtain from Equations 5.3.41, 5.3.42 and 5.3.39\nS0 = 1 + |a0|2 -|a1|2 uˆ · ~σ\n(5.3.43)\nWe write S0 as\nS0 = 1 + s 0 uˆ · ~σ\n(5.3.44)\nwhere 0 ≤ s0 < 1 and\n0 < |S| = 1 + s 02 ≤ 1\n(5.3.45)\nWe have now a generazized form of the density matrix associated with a partially polarized or even\nnatural light (if s0 = 0). In quantum mechanics we speak of a mixture of states.\nIt is usual in optics to change the normalization and set for a partially polarized beam\nS = s0 + ssˆ · ~σ\n(5.3.46)\nwhere s0 is the total intensity and s the intensity of the polarized component. We have for the\ndeterminant\n0 ≤|S| = s 2 - s 2 ≤ s 2\n0(31)\n(5.3.47)\nwhich is zero for polarized light and positive otherwise.\nIn addition to conserving or destroying phase relations, one may operate directly on the intensity\nas well. If one of the components of the analyser, say |uˆi or |u ˆi is blocked off, the instrument acts\nas a perfect polarizer.\nFormally, we can let the projection operator\n1 (1 ± uˆ · ~σ)\n\nact on the density matrix of the beam, which may be polarized fully, partially, or not at all. Non-\npolarized or natural light can be considered as a statistical ensemble of polarized light beams\nuniformly distributed over the Poincar e sphere. (See problem #15.)\nAn imperfect polarizer (such as a sheet of polaroid) exhibits an unequal absorption of two conjugate\nlinear polarizations. It can be represented as a Hermitian operator acting on S.\nWe have seen above that the inchoherent composition of the two beams of an analyzer is accounted,\nfor by the addition of the density matrix.\nConversely, every partially polarized beam can be constructed in such a fashion. (See problem\n#13.)\nYet we may wish to add incoherently an arbitrary set of partially polarized beams, and this is\nalways accomplished by adding their density matrices.\nThe question arises then: Could we not operate phenomenologically in terms of the density matri\nces alone?\nThe matter was considered already by Stokes (1852) who introduced a column vector with the\nfour components I, M, C, S corresponding to our s0,~s. A general instrument is represented by a\nreal 4 × 4 matrix. Note that the \"instrument\" might be also a molecule producing a change of\npolarization on scattering.\nThe 4x 4 matrices are commonly called Mueller matrices46. This formalism is usually mentioned\nalong with the Jones calculus of 2 × 2 complex matrices. This was developed by R. Clark Jones\nof the Polaroid Co. and his collaborators in a long series of papers in Journal of the American\nOptical Society in the 1940's (quoted e.g., by Shurcliff, and C. Whitney). This is basically a\ntwo-component spinor theory to deal with instruments which modify the polarization without de\npolarization or loss of intensity. It was developed in close contact with experiment without reliance\non an existing mathematical formalism.\nMueller liked to emphasize the purely phenomenological character of his formalism. The four\nStokes parameters of a beam can be determined from measurements by four filters 47. However\na difficulty of this phenomenological approach is that not every 4 × 4 matrix corresponds to a\nphysically realizable instrument or scattering object. This means that a so-called passive instrument\nmust neither increase total intensity nor create phase correlations. The situation is simpler in the\n2 × 2 matrix formulation in which the redundant parameters have been eliminated.\nHowever, we do not enter into such details, since polarization optics is not our primary concern.\nIn fact, the two-valuedness of the full spinor formalism brings about a certain complication which\n46The formalism was developed by the late Hans Mueller of M.I.T. Unfortunately these results were not adequately\npublished, but Mueller's influence has been considerable through his lectures and his students. The discussion of this\nsection may never have come about without the conversations I had with Hans Mueller in the course of years. For an\nindependent approach see also [Per42].\n47See [GR60]. Also [Whi71]\n\nis justified by the fact that our main interest is in the applications to quantum mechanics. We shall\ncompare the different types of applications which are available at this juncture in Section 5.5.\nMeanwhile in the next section we show that the concept of unitary spinor can be generalized to\nrelativistic situations. This is indispensable if the formalism is to be applied also to the propagation\nrather than only the polarization of light.\n5.4 Relativistic triads and spinors. A preliminary discussion.\nWe have arrived at the concept of unitary spinors by searching for the proper parametrization of a\nEuclidean triad. We shall arrive at relativistic spinors by parametrising the relativistic triad. This\nis not a standard term, but it seems appropriate to so designate the configuration E~, B~, ~k (electric\nand magnetic fields, and the wave vector) in a monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave in\nvacuum .\nThe propagation of light is a dynamic problem and we are not ready to discuss it within the\ngeometric-kinematic context of this chapter.\nThe purpose of this section is only to show that the formalism of unitary spinors developed thus\nfar can be extended to relativistic situations with only a few indispensable adjustments49.\nIt is a remarkable fact that the mutual orthogonality of the above mentioned vectors is a Lorentz\ninvariant property. However, we have to abandon the unitary normalization since the length of the\nvectors is affected by inertial transformations.\nAccordingly, we set up the relativistic analog of the Equations 5.1.40. We consider first\n1 k0 + ~\n|ξihξ| =\nk · ~σ = K\n(5.4.1)\n|ξ ihξ | =\nk0 - ~k · ~σ = K\n(5.4.2)\nwith the unitary normalization changed to\nhξ|ξi = hξ |ξ i = k0\n(5.4.3)\nThe Lorentz transformation properties of the spinors follow from that of K:\n|ξ0i = V |ξi\n(5.4.4)\n|ξ 0i = V |ξ i\n(5.4.5)\nhξ0| = hξ|V +\n(5.4.6)\nhξ 0| = hξ |V -1\n(5.4.7)\n48One might think of using the Poynting vector E~ × B~ instead of the wave vector ~k. This turns out to be quite\nimpractical.\n49This is in contrast with the standard method in which the unitary inner product of nonrelativistic quantum me\nchanics is replaced by an analog to the contraction method of tensor calculus.\n\n= h\n\nIf V = U is unitary, we have U = U, U + = U -1 .\nLet us define a second spinor by\n|ηihη| =\n(r0 + ~r · ~σ) = R\n(5.4.8)\nThe relativistic invariant, (2.2.3a)50 appears now as\n1 Tr RK\n|ηihη|ξ ihξ |\n(5.4.9)\n=\nTr\nξ|ηihη|ξ i = |hξ |ηi|2\nIt follows from Equations 5.4.4 and 5.4.7 that even the amplitude is invariant\nhξ |ηi = invariant\n(5.4.10)\nExplicitly it is equal to\n= ξ0η1 - ξ1η0 = ξ0 η0\nξ1 η1\n(5.4.11)\nη0\nη1\n(-ξ1, ξ0)\nWe turn now to the last two of the Equations 5.1.40 and write by analogy\n|ξihξ | ∼\nE~ + i ~B · ~σ = F\n(5.4.12)\n|ξ ihξ|\n∼\nE~ - iB~\n· ~σ = -F = F +\n(5.4.13)\nWe see that the field quantities have, in view of Equations 5.4.4-5.4.7 the correct transformation\nproperties.\nThe occurrence of the same spinor in Equations 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 5.4.12 and 5.4.13 ensures the expected\northogonality properties of the triad.\nHowever, in Equations 5.4.12 and 5.4.13 we write proportionality instead of equality, because we\nhave to admit a different normalization for the four-vector and the six-vector respectively. We are\nnot ready to discuss the matter at this point.\nIf in Equation 5.4.10 we choose the two spinors to be identical, the invariant vanishes:\nhξ |ξi = 0\n(5.4.14)\n50need to determine the correct equation reference - Editor.\n\nThe same is true of the invariant of the electromagnetic field:\n\nTr(FF ) = - T rF 2 ' - Tr |ξihξ |ξihξ |\n= -hξ |ξi\n= 0\n(5.4.15)\nThus from a single spinor we can build up only constructs corresponding toa plane wave. We do not\nenter here into the discussion of more complicated situations and note only that we cannot use the\ndevice of taking linear combination of conjugate spinors in the usual form a0|ξi + a1|ξ i, because\nthe two terms have contragradient Lorentz transformation properties. We write them, displaying\ntheir Lorentz transformations as\n\n|ξ0i\nS 0\n|ξi\n=\n(5.4.16)\n|ξ 0i\n0 S\n|ξ i\nWe have arrived at spinors of the Dirac type. We return to their discussion later.\nLet us conclude this section by considering the relation of the formalism to the standard formalism\nof van der Waerden. (See e.g., [MTW73])\nThe point of departure is Equation 5.4.4 applied to two spinors yielding the determinantal invariant\nof 5.4.11. The first characteristic aspect of the theory is the rule for raising the indices:\nη1 = η0 ,\nη0 = -η1\n(5.4.17)\nHence the invariant appears as\nξ0η0 + ξ1η1\n(5.4.18)\nThe motivation for writing the invariant in this form is to harmonize the presentation with the stan\ndard tensor formalism. In contrast, our expression 5.4.10, is an extension of the bra-ket formalism\nof nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, that is also quite natural for the linear algebra of complex\nvector spaces.\nA second distinctive feature is connected with the method of complexification. Van der Waerden\ntakes the complex conjugate of the matrix V by taking the complex conjugate of its elements,\nwhereas we deal with the Hermitian conjugate V + and the complex reflection V .\nFrom the practical point of view we tend to develop unitary and relativistic spinors in as united a\nform as objectively possible.\n5.5 Review of SU(2) and preview of quantization.\nOur introduction of the spinor concept at the beginning of Section 5.1 can be rationalized on the\nbasis of the following guidelines. First, we require a certain economy and wish to avoid dealing\n\nwith redundant parameters in specifying a rotating triad, just as we have previously solved the\nanalogous problem for the rotation operator51.\nSecond, we wish to have an efficient formalism to represent the rotational problem.\nWe have seen that the matrices of SU(2) satisfy all these requirements, but we find ourselves\nsaddled with a two-valuedness of the representation: |ξi and |ξi correspond to the same triad\nconfiguration. This is not a serious trouble, since our key relations 5.1.36 and 5.1.37 are quadratic\nin |ξi 52.\nThus the two-valuedness apperas here only as a computational aid that disappears in the final result.\nThe situation is different if we look at the formulas 5.1.42-5.1.66 of the same section (Section 5.1).\nThese equations are linear, they have a quantum mechanical character and we know that they are\nindeed applicable in the proper context. It is a pragmatic fact the two-valuedness is not just a\nnecessary nuisance, but has physical meaning. But to understand this meaning is a challenge\nwhich we can meet only in carefully chosen steps.\nWe wish to give a more physical interpretation to the triad, but avoid the impasse of the rigid body.\nFirst we associate the abstract Poincar e space with the physical system of the two-dimensional\ndegenerate oscillator. The rotation in the Poincar e space is associated with a phase shift between\nconjugate states, which is translated into a rotation of the Poincar e sphere, interpreted in turn as a\nchange in orientation, or change of shape of the vibrational patterns in ordinary space.\nIt is only a mild exaggeration to say that our transition from the triad in Euclidean space to that\nin Poincar e space is something like a \"quantization,\" in the sense as Schr odinger's wave equation\nassociates a wave with a particle. (Planck's h is to enter shortly!)\nIn this theory we have a good use for the conjugate spinors |ξi and |ξ i representing opposite\npolarizations, but we must identify |ξ i = -|ξi with |ξi53.\nThe foregoing is still nothing but a perfectly well-defined kinematic model. The next step is dif\nferent. As a \"second quantization\" we introduce Planck's h to define single photons54. A beam\nsplitting represented by a projection operator can be expressed in probabilistic terms.\nFormally all this is easy and we would at once have a great deal of the quantum mechanical for\nmalism involving the theory of measurement.\nNext, we could take the two-valuedness of the spinor seriously and obtain the formalism of isospin\nand of the neutrino, say as in Section 17, Fermion States, in [Kae65].\n51These two problems have been posed and solved by Euler in 1776! See [Whi64], page 8-12.\n52Some caution is needed in the practical application of Equation 5.2.8 in Section 5.2; however, this is only a\nsideline in the present context.\n53I failed to observe this rule in formulating the instructions for #11 in the Fourth Assignment. The result is a\nspurious phase in hx|Ri! However all this trouble is easily avoided.\n54If you want to call it the \"first quantization,\" I will not argue the point.\n\nFinally, instead of doubly degenerate vibrations, we could consider the triply degenerate vibrator\nand handle it by SU(3) [Lip02]. We shall not consider these generalizations at this point, however.\nBefore further expanding the formalism we should hope to understand better what we already have.\nFirst, a formal remark. Our results thus far developed are uniquely determined by the spinor\nformalism of Section 5.1 and by the program of considering the Poincar e sphere as the basic\nconfiguration space to be described by conventional spherical coordinates α, β or φ, θ 55.\nIt is noteworthy that this modest conceptual equipment carries us so far. We have obtained spinors,\ndensity matrices and have discussed at least fleetingly coherence, incoherence, quantum theory of\nmeasurement and transformation theory.\nWhat we do not get out of the theory is a specific interpretation of the underlying vibrational\nprocess since the formalism is thus far entirely independent of it. This fact gives us some under\nstanding of the scope and limit of quantum mechanics. We can apply the formalism to phenomena\nwe understand very little. However, since the same SU(2) formalism applies to polarized light,\nspin, isospin, strangeness and other phenomena, we learn little about their distinctive aspects.\nIn order to overcome this limitation we need a deeper understanding of what a quantized angular\nmomentum is in the framework of a dynamical problem.\nThe next chapter is devoted to a phenomenological discussion of the concepts of particle and wave.\nWe shall attempt to obtain sufficient hints for developing a dynamic theory in the form of a phase\nspace geometry in Chapter VI56.\n55These angles should be replaced by 2α, π/2-2β, φ and 2θ respectively in order to arrive at the angles conventional\nin polarization optics.\n56This chapter was not included in the Spring 1976 notes - Editor.\n\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5.3: Representation of Polarization in the Poincar e Sphere.

We consider here only the pure rotation\ngenerated by\nφ\nU = exp(-i uˆ · ~σ)\n(A.5.1)\n\nLet\nl0 = cos φ/2,\nl1 = sin φ/2ˆu1\n(A.5.2)\nl2 = sin φ/2ˆu3,\nl3 = sin φ/2ˆu3\n(A.5.3)\nu1 = cos(ˆu · xˆ1), . . . , etc.\n(A.5.4)\nu1 + u2 + u3 = 1\n(A.5.5)\nl0\n2 + l2 - l2 - l2\n2(l1l2 - l0l3)\n2(l1l3 + l0l2)\nk1\nk\n⎝ 2 ⎠ = ⎝\n2(l1l2 + l0l3)\nl0\n2 - l1\n2 + l2\n2 - l3\n2(l2l3 - l0l1) ⎠ = ⎝ k2 ⎠\n(A.5.6)\nk\n2(l1l3 - l0l3)\n2(l2l3 + l0l1)\nl2 - l2 - l2\n2 + l2\nk3\nk\nSuch expression are, of course not very practical. One usually considers infinitesimal relations\nwith the parameters dφμk. Integration of the infinitesimal operations into those of the finite group\ncan be achieved within the general theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras 57.\nIn our approach the integration is achieved by explicit construction for the special case of the\nrestricted Lorentz group. This is the first step in our program of using group theory to supplement\nor replace method of differential equations.\n57These matters are extensively treated in the mathematical literature. A monograph aiming at physicists is [Gil06]\n⎛\n⎞\n⎛\n⎞\n⎛\n⎞\n\n$\nB Problems\nThese are the homework assignments from the Spring 1977 version of the Physics 8.352 course.

However, the most efficient use of these concepts calls for some care.\nFor any matrix of A2\nA\nA-1 = A\n|A| = 2 Tr(AA )\n(A.4.1)\n| |\nIn the case of Hermitian matrices we have two alternatives:\nk0r0 - ~k ~r = 1 Tr(KR )\n(A.4.2)\n·\nor\nk0r0 - ~k ~r = 1 Tr(KR )\n(A.4.3)\n·\nIt will appear, however from later discussions, that the complex reflection of Equation A.4.3 is\nmore appropriate to describe the transition from contravariant to covariant entities.\nA case in point is the formal representation of the mirroring of a four-vector in a plane with the\nnormal along xˆ1. We have\n\nK0 = σ1Kσ1 = σ1 (k01 - k1σ1 - k2σ2 - k3σ3) σ1\n= σ1\n2 (k01 - k1σ1 + k2σ2 + k3σ3)\n= k01 - k1σ1 + k2σ2 + k3σ3\n(A.4.4)\nMore generally the mirroring in a plane with normal x is achieve by means of the operation\nK0 = ˆa ~σK aˆ ~σ\n(A.4.5)\n·\n·\nAgain, we could have chosen K instead of K .\nHowever, Eq (22) generalizes to the inversion of the electromagnetic six-vector f~ = E~ + iB~:\nE~ 0 + iB~ 0\n~σ = E~ + iB~\n~σ = -E~ + iB~\n~σ\n(A.4.6)\n·\n·\n·\nThis relation takes into account the fact that E~ is a polar and B~ an axial vector.\nA.5 On Parameterization and Integration\nThe explicit performance of the bilateral multiplication provides the connection between the pa\nrameters of rotation and the elements of the 4×4 matrices. We consider here only the pure rotation\ngenerated by\nφ\nU = exp(-i 2 uˆ · ~σ)\n(A.5.1)\n\nLet\nl0 = cos φ/2,\nl1 = sin φ/2ˆu1\n(A.5.2)\nl2 = sin φ/2ˆu3,\nl3 = sin φ/2ˆu3\n(A.5.3)\nu1 = cos(ˆu xˆ1), . . . , etc.\n(A.5.4)\n·\nu 2\n1 + u 2\n2 + u 2\n3 = 1\n(A.5.5)\n⎛\n⎞\n⎛\n⎞\n⎛\n⎞\nk0\nl0\n2 + l1\n2 - l2\n2 - l2\n2(l1l2 - l0l3)\n2(l1l3 + l0l2)\nk1\n⎝ k2\n0 ⎠ = ⎝\n2(l1l2 + l0l3)\nl0\n2 - l1\n2 + l2\n2 - l3\n2(l2l3 - l0l1) ⎠ = ⎝ k2 ⎠\n(A.5.6)\nk3\n2(l1l3 - l0l3)\n2(l2l3 + l0l1)\nl0\n2 - l1\n2 - l2\n2 + l3\nk3\nSuch expression are, of course not very practical. One usually considers infinitesimal relations\nwith the parameters dφμk. Integration of the infinitesimal operations into those of the finite group\ncan be achieved within the general theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras 57.\nIn our approach the integration is achieved by explicit construction for the special case of the\nrestricted Lorentz group. This is the first step in our program of using group theory to supplement\nor replace method of differential equations.\n57These matters are extensively treated in the mathematical literature.

      "content": "1 Introduction\nMathematical physics operates with a combination of the three major branches of mathematics:\ngeometry, algebra and infinitesimal analysis. The interplay of these elements has undergone a\nconsiderable change since the turn of the century.\nIn classical physics, analysis, in particular differential equations, plays a central role. This formal\nism is supplemented most harmoniously by Gibbsian vector algebra and calculus to account for\nthe. spatial, geometric properties of particles and fields.\nFew theorists have labored as patiently as Gibbs to establish the simplest possible formalism to\nmeet a particular need. His success can be assessed by the fact that -- almost a century later -- his\ncalculus, in the original notation, is in universal use. However, once full advantage has been taken\nof all simplifications permitted in the classical theory, there did not remain the reserve capacity\nto deal with quantum mechanics and relativity. The gap in the classical algebraic framework was\nsupplemented by Minkowski tensors and Hilbert vectors, matrix algebras, spinors, Lie groups and\na host of other constructs.\nUnfortunately, the advantages derived from the increased power and sophistication of the new\nalgebraic equipment are marred by side effects. There is a proliferation of overlapping techniques\nwith too little standardization.\nAlso, while the algebras maintain a vaguely geometrical character, the \"spaces\" referred to are\nmathematical abstractions with but scant appeal to ordinary spatial intuition.\nThese features are natural consequences of rapid growth which can be remedied by consolidation\nand streamlining; the problem is to adapt the Gibbsian principle of economy to more demanding\nconditions.\nThis course is a progress report on such a project. Our emphasis on formalism does not mean\nneglect of conceptual problems. In fact, the most rewarding aspect of our consolidation is the\nresulting conceptual clarity.\nThe central idea of the present approach is that group theory provides us with a flexible and com\nprehensive framework to describe and classify fundamental physical processes. It is hardly neces\nsary to argue that this method is indeed important in modern physics, yet its potentialities are still\nfar from exhausted. This may stem from the tendency to resort to group theory only for difficult\nproblems when other methods fail, or become too cumbersome. As a result, the discussions tend\nto be complicated and abstract.\nThe distinctive feature of the present method is to start with elementary problems, but treat them\nfrom an advanced view point, and to reconcile intuitive interpretation with a smooth transition to\ndeeper problems. By focusing on group theory from the outset, we can make full use of its unifying\npower.\nAs mentioned above, this is a report on work in progress. Although we shall confine ourselves to\nproblems that fall within the scope of the \"consolidated\" theory, we shall be in a position to discuss\nsome of the conceptual problems of quantum mechanics."

      "content": "Preface\nThese notes are a reproduction from original notes provided by Prof. Laszlo Tisza, for Physics\n8.352, Applied Geometric Algebra, offered in the Spring 1976 by the MIT Department of Physics.\nIn July 2008, I mentioned to Prof. Peter Fisher (MIT) that I had these notes and asked about sharing\nthem through the MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) site.\nThese notes were based on active research that Prof. Tisza was conducting while teaching this\ncourse. As such they were clearly a work in progress, but this also provided for a very engaging\ncourse. My original notes listed a preliminary outline that included seven chapters, but only notes\nfor the first four were provide in the Spring 1976. (If any former students have additional material\nplease contact the MIT OCW office.)\nProf. Tisza has kindly given his permission to convert these notes to LATEX and make a PDF version\navailable on the MIT OCW site. I have tried to reproduce these notes a faithly as possible from\nmy original copy, faded mimeographed version. Where there were obvious typographical errors or\nomissions I have made corrections, otherwise no alterations were made to the text or mathematics.\nI have renumbered the sections an equations to be consistent with modern LATEX typesetting. I\naccept all responsibilty for transcription errors and if other errors are discovered please contact me\nthrough MIT OCW office.\nMy motivation for making these notes available to a wide audience is three fold. First is the fact\nthat even after more than 32 years these notes still provide a unique view into the mathematical\ndescription of the physical world. Secondly, they illustrate the wonderful and engaging teaching\nstyle of Prof. Tisza that provided the students insight into the creative process of \"doing\" Physics.\nFinally, this is a small way to honor Prof. Tisza, who celebrated his 101th birthday this year, for\nbeing such a wonderful and engaging instructor.\nI would like to acknowledge several people who assisted in the process of bring these notes to\nMIT OCW. Prof. William Thacker, Department of Physics, Saint Louis University, who was a\nstudent of Prof. Tisza, provided his copy of the problem assignments included in these notes. Prof.\nEdmund Bertschinger Department Head, and Prof. Peter Fisher, of the MIT Physics Department\nfor supporting and faciliting this effort, and finally Elizabeth Derienzo of OCW.\nFinally my thanks to Prof. Tisza for teaching this course.\nSamuel Gasster, '77 (Course 18)\nPacific Palisades, CA\nNovember 2008\nii"

      "content": "2 Algebraic Preliminaries\n2.1 Groups 1\nWhen group theory was introduced into the formalism of quantum mechanics in the late 1920's to\nsolve abstruse spectroscopic problems, it was considered to be the hardest and the most unwelcome\nbranch of mathematical physics. Since that time group theory has been simplified and popularized\nand it is widely practiced in many branches of physics, although this practice is still limited mostly\nto difficult problems where other methods fail.\nIn contrast, I wish to emphasize that group theory has also simple aspects which prove to be\neminently useful for the systematic presentation of the material of this course.\nPostponing for a while the precise definition,- we state somewhat loosely that we call a set of ele\nments a group if it is closed with respect to a single binary operation usually called multiplication.\nThis multiplication is, in general not to be taken in the common sense of the word, and need not\nMbe commutative. It is, however, associative and invertible.\nThe most common interpretation of such an operation is a transformation. Say, the translations\nand rotations of Euclidean space; the transformations that maintain the symmetry of an object such\nas a cube or a sphere. The transformations that connect the findings of different inertial observers\nwith each other.\nWith some training we recognize groups anywhere we look. Thus we can consider the group of\ndisplacement of a rigid body, and also any particular subset of these displacements' that arise in\nthe course of a particular motion.\nWe shall see indeed, that group theory provides a terminology that is invaluable for the precise\nand intuitive discussion of the most elementary and fundamental principles of physics. As to the\ndiscussion of specific problems we shall concentrate on those that can be adequately handled by\nstretching the elementary methods, and we shall not invoke advanced group theoretical results.\nTherefore we turn now to a brief outline of the principal definitions and theorems that we shall\nneed in the sequel.\nLet us consider a set of elements A, B, C, . . . and a binary operation that is traditionally called\n\"multiplication\". We refer to this set as a group G if the following requirements are satisfied.\n1. For any ordered pair, A, B there is a product AB = C. The set is closed with respect to\nmultiplication.\n2. The associative law holds: (AB)C = A(BC).\n3. There is a unit element E ∈G such that EA = AE = A for all A ∈G.\n1This outline serves mainly to delimit the extent of abstract group theory to be used later. Supplementary reading\nis recommended. See for instance [Tin64, Wig59, BM41].\n\n4. For each element A there is an inverse A-1 with A-1A = AA-1 = E.\nThe multiplication need not be commutative. If it is, the group is called Abelian.\nThe number of elements in G is called the order of the group. This may be finite or infinite,\ndenumerable or continuous.\nIf a subset of G satisfies the group postulates, it is called a subgroup.\n2.1.1 Criterion for Subgroups\nIf a subset of the elements of a group of finite order G is closed under multiplication, then it is a\nsubgroup of G.\nProve that the group postulates are satisfied. Discuss the case of groups of infinite order.\nIn order to explain the use of these concepts we list a few examples of sets chosen from various\nbranches of mathematics of interest in physics, for which the group postulates are valid.\nExamples\n1. The set of integers (positive, negative and zero) is an Abelian group of infinite order where\nthe common addition plays the role of multiplication. Zero serves as the unit and the inverse\nof a is -a.\n2. The set of permutations of n objects, called also the symmetric group S(n), is of order n!. It\nis non-Abelian for n > 2.\n3. The infinite set of n × n matrices with non-vanishing determinants. The operation is matrix\nmultiplication; it is in general non-commutative.\n4. The set of covering operations of a symmetrical object such as a rectangular prism (four\ngroup), a regular triangle, tetrahedron, a cube or a sphere, to mention only a few important\ncases. Expressing the symmetry of an object, they are called symmetry groups. Multipli\ncation of two elements means that the corresponding operations are carried out in a definite\nsequence. Except for the first case, these groups are non- Abelian.\nThe concrete definitions given above specify the multiplication rule for each group. For finite\ngroups the results are conveniently represented in multiplication tables, from which one extracts the\nentire group structure. One recognizes for instance that some of the groups of covering operations\nlisted under (4) are subgroups of others.\nIt is easy to prove the rearrangement theorem: In the multiplication table each column or row\ncontains each element once and only once. This theorem is very helpful in setting up multiplication\ntables. (Helps to spot errors!)\n\n2.1.2 Cyclic Groups\nFor an arbitrary element A of a finite G form the sequence: A, A2, A3 ..., let the numbers of distinct\nelements in the sequence be p. It is easy to show that Ap = E. The sequence\nA, A2, . . . , Ap = E\n(2.1.1)\nis called the period of A; p is the order of A. The period is an Abelian group, a subgroup of G. It\nmay be identical to it, in which case G is called a cyclic group.\nCorollary: Since periods are subgroups, the order of each element is a divisor of the order of the\ngroup.\n2.1.3 Cosets\nLet H be a subgroup of G with elements E, H2, ...Hh; the set of elements\nEA, H2A, . . . , HhA\n(2.1.2)\nis called a right coset HA provided A is not in H. It is easily shown that G can be decomposed as\nG = HE + HA2 + HAh\n(2.1.3)\ninto distinct cosets, each of which contains h elements. Hence the order g of the group is\ng = hk and h = g/k.\n(2.1.4)\nThus we got the important result that the order of a subgroup is a divisor of the order of the group.\nNote that the cosets are not subgroups except for HE = H which alone contains the unit element.\nSimilar results hold for left cosets.\n2.1.4 Conjugate Elements and Classes\nThe element XAX-1 is said to be an element conjugate to A. The relation of being conjugate is\nreflexive, symmetric and transitive. Therefore the elements conjugate to each other form a class.\nA single element A determines the entire class:\nEAE-1 = A, A2AA2\n-1, . . . , AnAAn\n-1\n(2.1.5)\n\nHere all elements occur at least once, possibly more than once. The elements of the group can be\ndivided into classes, and every element appears in one and only one class.\nIn the case of groups of covering operations of symmetrical objects, elements of the same class\ncorrespond to rotations by the same angle around different axes that transform into each other by\nsymmetry operations.\nE.g. the three mirror planes of the regular triangle are in the same class and so are the four rotations\nby 2π/3 in a tetrahedron, or the eight rotations by ±2π/3 in a cube.\nIt happens that the elements of two groups defined in different conceptual terms are in one-one\nrelation to each other and obey the same multiplication rules. A case in point is the permutation\ngroup S(3) and the symmetry group of the regular triangle. Such groups are called isomorphic.\nRecognizing isomorphisms may lead to new insights and to practical economies in the study of\nindividual groups.\nIt is confirmed in the above examples that the term \"multiplication\" is not to be taken in a literal\nsense. What is usually meant is the performance of operations in a specified sequence, a situation\nthat arises in many practical and theoretical contexts.\nThe operations in question are often transformations in ordinary space, or in some abstract space\n(say, the configuration space of an object of interest). In order to describe these transformations in\na quantitative fashion, it is important to develop an algebraic formalism dealing with vector spaces.\nHowever, before turning to the algebraic developments in Section 2.3, we consider first a purely\ngeometric discussion of the rotation group in ordinary three-dimensional space.\n2.2 The geometry of the three-dimensional rotation group. The Rodrigues-\nHamilton theorem\nThere are three types of transformations that map the Euclidean space onto itself: translations,\nrotations and inversions. The standard notation for the proper rotation group is O+, or SO(3),\nshort for \"simple orthogonal group in three dimensions\". \"Simple\" means that the determinant\nof the transformation is +1, we have proper rotations with the exclusion of the inversion of the\ncoordinates:\nx →\n-x\ny →\n-y\n(2.2.1)\nz\n-z\n→\na problem to which we shall return later.\nIn contrast to the group of translations, SO(3) is non-Abelian, and its theory, beginning with the\nadequate choice of parameters is quite complicated. Nevertheless, its theory was developed to a\nremarkable degree during the 18th century by Euler.\n\nWithin classical mechanics the problem of rotation is not considered to be of fundamental impor\ntance. The Hamiltonian formalism is expressed usually in terms of point masses, which do not\nrotate. There is a built-in bias in favor of translational motion.\nThe situation is different in quantum mechanics where rotation plays a paramount role. We have\ngood reasons to give early attention to the rotation group, although at this point we have to confine\nourselves to a purely geometrical discussion that will be put later into an algebraic form.\nAccording to a well known theorem of Euler, an arbitrary displacement of a rigid body with a\nsingle fixed point can be conceived as a rotation around a fixed axis which can be specified in\nterms of the angle of rotation φ, and the unit vector uˆ along the direction of the rotational axis.\nConventionally the sense of rotation is determined by the right hand rule. Symbolically we may\nwrite R = {ˆu, φ}.\nThe first step toward describing the group structure is to provide a rule for the composition of rota\ntions with due regard for the noncommuting character of this operation. The gist of the argument\nis contained in an old theorem by Rodrigues-Hamilton 2.\nOur presentation follows that of C. L. K. Whitney [Whi68]. Consider the products\nR3 = R2R1\n(2.2.2)\nR3\n= R1R2\n(2.2.3)\nwhere R3 is the composite rotation in which R1 is followed by R2.\nFigure 2.1 represents the unit sphere and is constructed as follows: the endpoints of the vectors uˆ1,\nand uˆ2 determine a great circle, the smaller arc of which forms the base of mirror-image triangles\nhaving angles φ1/2 and φ2/2 as indicated. The endpoint of the vector uˆ0\n1 is located by rotating uˆ1,\nby angle φ2 about uˆ2. Our claim, that the other quantities appearing on the figure are legitimately\nlabeled φ3/2, uˆ3, uˆ0\n3 is substantiated easily. Following the sequence of operations indicated in 2.2.3,\nwe see that the vector called uˆ3, is first rotated by angle φ1, about uˆ1, , which takes in into uˆ0\n3. Then\nit is rotated by angle φ2 about uˆ2, which takes it back to uˆ3. Since it is invariant, it is indeed the axis\nof the combined rotation. Furthermore, we see that the first rotation leaves uˆ1, invariant and the\nsecond rotation, that about uˆ2, carries it into uˆ0\n1, the position it would reach if simply rotated about\nuˆ3, by the angle called φ3. Thus that angle is indeed the angle of the combined rotation. Note that\na symmetrical argument shows that uˆ0\n3 and φ3 are the axis and angle of the rotation P3\n0 = R1R2.\nEquation 2.2.3 can be expressed also as\nR3\n-1R2R1 = 1\n(2.2.4)\nwhich is interpreted as follows: rotation about uˆ1, by φ1, followed by rotation aboutuˆ2, by φ2,\nfollowed by rotation about uˆ3, by minus φ3, produces no change. This statement is the Rodrigues-\nHamilton theorem.\n2See [Whi64]\n\nFigure 2.1: Composition of the Rotations of the Sphere. α = φ1/2, β = φ2/2, γ = φ3/2.\n\n2.3 The n-dimensional vector space V (n)\nThe manipulation of directed quantities, such as velocities, accelerations, forces and the like is\nof considerable importance in classical mechanics and electrodynamics. The need to simplify the\nrather complex operations led to the development of an abstraction: the concept of a vector.\nThe precise meaning of this concept is implicit in the rules governing its manipulations. These\nrules fall into three main categories: they pertain to\n1. the addition of vectors,\n2. the multiplication of vectors by numbers (scalars),\n3. the multiplication of vectors by vectors (inner product and vector product.\nWhile the subtle problems involved in 3 will be taken up in the next chapter, we proceed here to\nshow that rules falling under 1 and 2 find their precise expression in the abstract theory of finite\ndimensional vector spaces.\nThe rules related to the addition of vectors can be concisely expressed as follows: vectors are\nelements of a set V that forms an Abelian group under the operation of addition, briefly an additive\ngroup.\nThe inverse of a vector is its negative, the zero vector plays the role of unity.\nThe numbers, or \"scalars\" mentioned under (ii) are usually taken to be the real or the complex\nnumbers. For many considerations involving vector spaces there is no need to specify which of\nthese alternatives is chosen. In fact all we need is that the scalars form a field. More explicitly, they\nare elements of a set which is closed with respect to two binary operations: addition and multi\nplication which satisfy the common commutative, associative and distributive laws; the operations\nare all invertible provided they do not involve division by zero.\nA vector space V (F ) over a field F is formally defined as a set of elements forming an additive\ngroup that can be multiplied by the elements of the field F .\nIn particular, we shall consider real and complex vector fields V (R) and V (C) respectively.\nI note in passing that the use of the field concept opens the way for a much greater variety of inter\npretations, but this is of no interest in the present context. In contrast, the fact that we have been\nconsidering \"vector\" as an undefined concept will enable us to propose in the sequel interpretations\nthat go beyond the classical one as directed quantities. Thus the above defintion is consistent with\nthe interpretation of a vector as a pair of numbers indicating the amounts of two chemical species\npresent in a mixture, or alternatively, as a point in phase space spanned by the coordinates and\nmomenta of a system of mass points.\nWe shall now summarize a number of standard results of the theory of vector spaces.\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nSuppose we have a set of non-zero vectors {~x1, ~x2, . . . , ~xn} in V which satisfy the relation\nak~xk = 0\n(2.3.1)\nk\nwhere the scalars ak ∈ F , and not all of them vanish. In this case the vectors are said to be linearly\ndependent. If, in contrast, the relation 2.3.1 implies that all ak = 0, then we say that the vectors\nare linearly independent.\nIn the former, case there is at least one vector of the. set that.can be written as a linear combination\nof the rest:\nm-1\n~xm =\nbk~xk\n(2.3.2)\nDefinition 2.1. A (linear) basis in a vector space V is a set E = {~e1, ~e2, . . . , ~en} of linearly\nindependent vectors such that every vector in V is a linear combination of the ~en. The basis is said\nto span or generate the space.\nA vector space is finite dimensional if it has a finite basis. It is a fundamental theorem of linear\nalgebra that the number of elements in any basis in a finite dimensional space is the same as in\nany other basis. This number n is the basis independent dimension of V ; we include it into the\ndesignation of the vector space: V (n, F ).\nGiven a particular basis we can express any ~x ∈ V as a linear combination\nn\n~x =\nx k~ek\n(2.3.3)\nwhere the coordinates xk are uniquely determined by E. The xk~ek (k = l, 2, . . . , n) are called\nthe components of ~x. The use of superscripts is to suggest a contrast between the transformation\nproperties of coordinates and basis to be derived shortly.\nUsing bases, called also coordinate systems, or frames is convenient for handling vectors -- thus\naddition performed by adding coordinates. However, the choice of a particular basis introduces an\nelement of arbitrariness into the formalism and this calls for countermeasures.\nSuppose we introduce a new basis by means of a nonsingular linear transformation:\n~e0\ni =\nSi\nk~ek\n(2.3.4)\nk\nwhere the matrix of the transformation has a nonvanishing determinant\n= 0\n(2.3.5)\ni\n|Sk| 6\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX X\n\nX\nensuring that the ~e0\ni form a linearly independent set, i.e., an acceptable basis. Within the context of\nthe linear theory this is the most general transformation we have to consider 3.\nWe ensure the equivalence of the different bases by requiring that\n~x =\nx k~ek =\nx i0~e0\ni\n(2.3.6)\nInserting Equation 2.3.4 into Equation 2.3.6 we get\n~x =\nx i0\nSi\nk~ek\n=\nx i0Si\nk ~ek\n(2.3.7)\nand hence in conjunction with Equation 2.3.5\nx k =\nSi\nk x i0\n(2.3.8)\nNote the characteristic \"turning around\" of the indices as we pass from Equation 2.3.4 to Equa\ntion 2.3.8 with a simultaneous interchange of the roles of the old and the new frame 4. The un\nderlying reason can be better appreciated if the foregoing calculation is carried out in symbolic\nform.\nLet us write the coordinates and the basis vectors as n × 1 column matrices\n⎛\n⎞\n⎛\n⎞\nx1\n~e1\n⎜\n⎟\n⎜\n⎟\nX = ⎝ ... ⎠\nE = ⎝ ... ⎠\n(2.3.9)\nxk\n~ek\nEquation 2.3.6 appears then as a matrix product\n~x = XT E = XT S-1SE = X0T E0\n(2.3.10)\nwhere the superscript stands for \"transpose.\"\nWe ensure consistency by setting\nE0 = SE\n(2.3.11)\nX\n0T\n= XT S-1\n(2.3.12)\nX\n0 = S-1T X\n(2.3.13)\nThus we arrive in a lucid fashion at the results contained in Equations 2.3.4 and 2.3.8. We see that\nthe \"objective\" or \"invariant\" representations of vectors are based on the procedure of transforming\nbases and coordinates in what is called a contragredient way.\n3These transformations form the general linear group GL(n, R), or GL(n, C)\n4See [Hal58], p. 66\n\nThe vector ~x itself is sometimes called a contravariant vector, to be distinguished by its transfor\nmation properties from covariant vectors to be introduced later.\nThere is a further point to be noted in connection with the factorization of a vector into basis and\ncoordinates.\nThe vectors we will be dealing with have usually a dimention such as length, velocity, momentum,\nforce and the like. It is important, in such cases, that the dimension be absorbed in the basis vectors\n~ek. In contrast, the coordinates xk are elements of the field F , the products of which are still in F ,\nthey are simply numbers. It is not surprising that the multiplication of vectors with other vectors\nconstitutes a subtle problem. Vector spaces in which there is provision for such an operation are\ncalled algebras; they deserve a careful examination.\nIt should be finally pointed out that there are interesting cases in which vectors have a dimen\nsionless character. They can be built up from the elements of the field F , which are arranged as\nn-tuples, or as m × n matrices.\nThe n × n case is particularly interesting, because matrix multiplication makes these vector spaces\ninto algebras in the sense just defined.\n2.4 How to multiply vectors? Heuristic considerations\nIn evaluating the various methods of multiplying vectors with vectors, we start with a critical\nanalysis of the procedure of elementary vector calculus based on the joint use of the inner or\nscalar product and the vector product.\nThe first of these is readily generalized to V (n, R), and we refer to the literature for further detail.\nIn contrast, the vector product is tied to three dimensions, and in order to generalize it, we have to\nrecognize that it is commonly used in two contexts, to perform entirely different functions.\nFirst to act as a rotation operator, to provide the increment δ~a of a vector ~a owing to a rotation by\nan angle δθ around an axis nˆ:\nδ~a = δθnˆ × ~a\n(2.4.1)\nHere δθnˆ is a dimensionless operator that transforms a vector into another vector in the same space.\nSecond, to provide an \"area\", the dimension of which is the product of the dimension of the factors.\nIn addition to the geometrical case, we have also such constructs as the angular momentum\nL~ = ~r × ~p\n(2.4.2)\nThe product is here \"exterior\" to tha original vector space.\nThere is an interesting story behind this double role of the vector product. Gibbs' vector algebra\narose out of the attempt of reconciling and simplifying two ingenious, but complicated geometric\nalgebras which were advanced almost simultaneously in the 1840's. Sir William Rowan Hamilton's\n\ntheory of quaternions is adapted to problems of rotation in three- and four-dimensional spaces,\nwhereas Hermann Grassman's Ausdehnungslehre (Theory of Extensions) deals with volumes in\nspaces of an arbitrary number of dimensions. The dichotomy corresponds to that of Equations 2.4.1\nand 2.4.2.\nThe complementary character of the two calculi was not recognized at the time, and the adherents\nof the two methods were in fierce competition. Gibbs found his way out of the difficulty by\nremoving all complicated and controversial elements from both calculi and by reducing them to\ntheir common core. The result is our well known elementary vector calculus with its dual-purpose\nvector product which seemed adequate for three-dimensional/space 5.\nIronically, the Gibbsian calculus became widely accepted at a time when the merit of Hamilton's\nfour-dimensional rotations was being vindicated in the context of the Einstein-Minkowski four-\ndimensional world.\nAlthough it is possible to adapt quaternions to deal with the Lorentz group, it is more practical\nto use instead the algebra of complex two-by-two matrices, the so-called Pauli algebra, and the\ncomplex vectors (spinors) on which these matrices operate. These methods are descendents of\nquaternion algebra, but they are more general, and more in line with quantum mechanical tech\nniques. We shall turn to their development in the next Chapter.\nIn recent years, also some of Grassmann's ideas have been revived and the exterior calculus is now\na standard technique of differential geometry (differential forms, calculus of manifolds). These\nmatters are relevant to the geometry of phase space, and we shall discuss them later on.\n2.5 A Short Survey of Linear Groups\nThe linear vector space V (n, F ) provides us with the opportunity to define a number of linear\ngroups which we shall use in the sequel.\nWe start with the group of nonsingular linear transformations defined by Equations 2.3.4 and 2.3.5\nof Section 2.3 and designated as GL(n, R), for \"general linear group over the field F.\" If the matri\nces are required to have unit determinants, they are called unimodular, and the group is SL(n, F ),\nfor simple linear group.\nLet us consider now the group GL(n, R) over the real field, and assume that an inner product is\ndefined:\nx1y1 + x2y2 + . . . + xnyn = XT Y\n(2.5.1)\nTransformations which leave this form invariant are called orthogonal. By using Equations 2.3.10\nand 2.3.12 of Sectionsec:vec-space, we see that they satisfy the condition\nOT O = I\n(2.5.2)\n5The new vector calculus was not received with undivided enthusiasm. Professor Tait referred to it as \". . . a sort\nof hermaphrodite monster compounded of the notations of Hamilton and Grassmann.\" Quoted by Gibbs in Collected\nWorks, Volume II, Part II, p 155.\n\nwhere I is the unit matrix. The corresponding group is called O(n).\nIt follows from 2.5.2 that the determinant of O is detO = |O| = ±1. The matrices with positive\ndeterminant form a subgroup SO(n).\nThe orthogonal groups have an important geometrical meaning, they leave the so-called metric\nproperties, lengths and angles invariant. The group SO(n) corresponds to pure rotations, these\noperations can be continuously connected with the identity. In contrast, transformations with neg\native determinants involve the inversion, and hence mirrorings and improper rotations. The set of\nmatrices with |O| = -1, does not form a group, since it does not contain the unit element.\nThe geometrical interpretation of GL(n, R) is not explained as easily. Instead of metric Euclidean\ngeometry, we arrive at the less familiar affine geometry, the practical applications of which are not\nso direct. We shall return to these questions in Chapter VII6. However, in the next section we shall\nshow that the geometrical interpretation of the group of unimodular transformations SL(n, R) is\nto leave volume invariant.\nWe turn now to an extension of the concept of metric geometry. We note first that instead of re\nquiring the invariance of the expression 2.5.1, we could have selected an arbitrary positive definite\nquadratic form in order to establish a metric. However, a proper choice of basis in V(n, R) leads\nus back to Equation 2.5.1.\nIf the invariant quadratic form is indefinite, it reduces to the canonical form\nx1\n2 + x2\n2 + . . . + xk\n2 - xk\n+1 - . . . - xk\n+l\n(2.5.3)\nThe corresponding group of invariance is pseudo-orthogonal denoted as O(k, l).\nIn this category the Lorentz group SO(3, 1) is of fundamental physical interest. At this point\nwe accept this as a fact, and a sufficient incentive for us to examine the mathematical structure of\nSO(3, 1) in Section 3. However, subsequently, in Section 4, we shall review the physical principles\nwhich are responsible for the prominent role of this group. The nature of the mathematical study\ncan be succinctly explained as follows.\nThe general n × n matrix over the real field contains n2 independent parameters. The condition\n2.5.2 cuts down this number to n(n - l)/2. For n = 3 the number of parameters is cut down from\nnine to three, for n = 4 from sixteen to six. The parameter count is the same for SO(3, 1) as\nfor SO(4). One of the practical problems involved in the applications of these groups is to avoid\ndealing with the redundant variables, and to choose such independent parameters that can be easily\nidentified with geometrically and physically relevant quantities. This is the problem discussed in\nSection 3. We note that SO(3) is a subgroup of the Lorentz group, and the two groups are best\nhandled within the same framework.\nIt will turn out that the proper parametrization can be best attained in terms of auxiliary vector\nspaces defined over the complex field. Therefore we conclude our list of groups by adding the\nunitary groups.\n6This chapter was not included in the Spring 1976 notes - Editor.\n\nX\nLet us consider the group GL(n, C) and impose an invariant Hermitian form\naikxix∗\nk\nthat can be brought to the canonical form\nx1x∗\n1 + x2x2\n∗ + . . . + xnx∗\nn = X+X\n(2.5.4)\nwhere X+ = X∗T is the Hermitian adjoint of X and the star stands for the conjugate complex.\nExpression 2.5.4 is invariant under transformations by matrices that satisfy the condition\nU +U = I\n(2.5.5)\nThese matrices are called unitary, they form the unitary group U(n). Their determinants have the\nabsolute value one. If the determinant is equal to one, the unitary matrices are also, unimodular,\nwe have the simple unitary group SU(n).\n2.6 The unimodular group SL(n, R) and the invariance of volume\nIt is well known that the volume of a parallelepiped spanned by linearly independent vectors is\ngiven by the determinant of the vector components. It is evident therefore that a transformation\nwith a unimodular matrix leaves this expression for the volume invariant.\nYet the situation has some subtle aspects which call for a closer examination. Although the calcu\nlation of volume and area is among the standard procedures of geometry, this is usually carried out\nin metric spaces, in which length and angle have their well known Euclidean meaning. However,\nthis is a too restrictive assumption, and the determinantal formula can be justified also within affine\ngeometry without using metric concepts7.\nSince we shall repeatedly encounter such situations, we briefly explain the underlying idea for the\ncase of areas in a two-dimensional vector space V(2, R).\nWe advance two postulates:\n1. Area is an additive quantity: the area of a figure is equal to the sum of the areas of its parts.\n2. Translationally congruent figures have equal areas.\n(The point is that Euclidean congruence'involves also rotational congruence, which is not available\nto us because of the absence of metric.)\nWe proceed now in successive steps as shown in Figure 2.2.\n7See [Cox69], Section 13.4 Equiaffinites; [VY18], Vol. II, p. 105, 291; [Cur68], Chapter 5.\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 2.2: Translational congruence and equal area.\n\nConsider at first the vectors\n~x = x 1~e1\n~y = y 2~e2\nwhere the coordinates are integers (Figure 2.2a). The area relative to the unit cell is obtained\nthrough simple counting as x1y2 . The same result can be justified for any real values for the\ncoordinates by subdivision and a limiting process.\nWe are permitted to write this result in determinantal form:\nx y = x1\ny2\n(2.6.1)\nIf the vectors\n~x = x 1~e1 + x 2~e2\n~y = y 1~e1 + y 2~e2\ndo not coincide with the coordinate axes, the coincidence can be achieved in no more than two\nsteps (Figures 2.2b and 2.2c) using the translational congruence of the parallelograms (0123)\n(012'3') (012\"3').\nBy an elementary geometrical argument one concludes from here that the area spanned by ~x and ~y\nis equal to the area spanned by eˆ1 and eˆ2 multiplied by the determinant\nx\nx\ny\ny\n(2.6.2)\nThis result can be justified also in a more elegant way: The geometrical operations in figures b and\nc consist of adding the multiple of the vector ~y to the vector ~x, or adding the multiple of the second\nrow of the determinant to the first row, and we know that such operations leave the value of the\ndeterminant unchanged.\nThe connection between determinant and area can be generalized to three and more dimensions,\nalthough the direct geometric argument would become increasingly cumbersome.\nThis defect will be remedied most effectively in terms of the Grassmann algebra that will be de\nveloped in Chapter VII8.\n2.7 On \"alias\" and \"alibi\". The Object Group\nIt is fitting to conclude this review of algebraic preliminaries by formulating a rule that is to guide\nus in connecting the group theoretical concepts with physical principles,\n8This chapter was not included in the Spring 1976 notes - Editor.\n\nOne of the concerns of physicists is to observe, identify and classify particles. Pursuing this ob\njective we should be able to tell whether we observe the same object when encountered under\ndifferent conditions in different states. Thus the identity of an object is implicitly given by the set\nof states in which we recognize it to be the same. It is plausible to consider the transformations\nwhich connect these states with each other, and to assume that they form a group. Accordingly, a\nprecise way of identifying an object is to specify an associated object group.\nThe concept of object group is extremely general, as it should be, in view of the vast range of\nsituations it is meant to cover. It is useful to consider specific situations in more detail.\nFirst, the same object may be observed by different inertial observers whose findings are connected\nby the transformations of the inertial group, to be called also the passive kinematic group. Second,\nthe space-time evolution of the object in a fixed frame of reference can be seen as generated by an\nactive kinematic group. Finally, if the object is specified in phase space, we speak of the dynamic\ngroup.\nThe fact that linear transformations in a vector space can be given a passive and an active interpre\ntation, is well known. In the mathematical literature these are sometimes designated by the colorful\nterms \"alias\" and \"alibi,\" respectively. The first means that the transformation of the basis leads to\nnew \"names\" for the same geometrical, or physical objects. The second is a mapping by which the\nobject is transformed to another \"location\" with respect to the same frame.\nThe important groups of invariance are to be classified as passive groups. Without in any way\nminimizing their importance, we shall give much attention also to the active groups. This will\nenable us to handle, within a unified group-theoretical framework, situations commonly described\nin terms of equations of motion, and also the so-called \"preparations of systems\" so important in\nquantum mechanics.\nIt is the systematic joint use of \"alibi\" and \"alias\" that characterizes the following argument."

      "content": "3 The Lorentz Group and the Pauli Algebra\n3.1 Introduction\nTwentieth century physics is dominated by the development of relativity and quantum mechanics,\ndisciplines centered around the universal constants c and h respectively. Historically, the emer\ngence of these constants revealed a socalled breakdown of classical concepts.\nFrom the point of view of our present knowledge, it would be evidently desirable to avoid such\nbreakdowns and formulate only principles which are correct according to our present knowledge.\nUnfortunately, no one succeeded thus far to suggest a \"correct\" postulational basis which would\nbe complete enough for the wide ranging practical needs of physics.\nThe purpose of this course is to explore a program in which we forego, or rather postpone, the\nrequirement of completeness, and consider at first only simple situations. These are described in\nterms of concepts which form the basis for the development of a precise mathematical formalism\nwith empirically verified physical implications. The continued alternation of conceptual analysis\nwith formal developments gradually extends and deepens the range of situations covered, without\naffecting consistency and empirical validity.\nAccording to the central idea of quantum mechanics all particles have undulatory properties, and\nelectromagnetic radiation has corpuscular aspects. In the quantitative development of this idea we\nhave to make a choice, whether to start with the classical wave concept and build in the corpscular\naspects, or else start with the classical concept of the point particle, endowed with a constant and\ninvariant mass, and modify these properties by means of the wave concept. Eventually, the result\ning theory should be independent of the path chosen, but the details of the construction process are\ndifferent.\nThe first alternative is apparent in Einstein's photon hypothesis9, which is closely related with his\nspecial theory of relativity10.\nIn contrast, the wealth of nonrelativistic problems within atomic, molecular and nuclear physics\nfavored the second approach which is exploited in the Bohr-Heisenberg quantum mechanics.\nThe course of the present developments is set by the decision of following up the Einsteinian\ndeparture.\n3.2 The corpuscular aspects of light\nAs a first step in carrying out the problem just stated, we start with a precise, even though schematic,\nformulation of wave kinematics.\n9See Reference[Ein05a].\n10See reference [Ein05b]. Einstein discussed the implications of relativistic and quantum effects on the theory of\nradiation in an address before the 81st assembly of the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, Salzburg, 1909\n[Ein09].\n\nWe consider first a spherical wave front\nro\n2 - ~r 2 = 0\n(3.2.1)\nwhere\nro = ct\n(3.2.2)\nand t is the time elapsed since emission to the instantaneous wave front.\nIn order to describe propagation in a definite direction, say along the unit vector kˆ, we introduce\nan appropriately chosen tangent plane corresponding to a monochromatic plane wave\nkoro - ~k ~r = 0\n(3.2.3)\n·\nwith\nko = ω/c\n(3.2.4)\n~k = 2π\nλ\nˆk\n(3.2.5)\nand\nko\n2 - ~k2 = 0\n(3.2.6)\nwhere the symbols have their conventional meanings.\nNext we postulate that radiation has a granular character, as it is expressed already in Definition 1 of\nNewton's Optics! However, in a more quantitative sense we state the standard quantum condition\naccording to which a quantum of light pulse with the wave vector (ko,~k) is associated with a\nfour-momentum\n(po, ~p) = ~(ko,~k)\n(3.2.7)\npo\n2 - p~2 = 0\n(3.2.8)\nwith\nE\npo =\n(3.2.9)\nc\nwhere E is the energy of the light quantum, or photon.\nThe proper coordination of the two descriptions involving spherical and plane waves, presents\nproblems to which we shall return later. At this point it is sufficient to note that individual photons\nhave directional properties described by a wave vector,and a spherical wave can be considered as\nan assembly of photons emitted isotropically from a small source.\nAs the next step in our procedure we argue that the photon as a particle should be associated with\nan object group, as introduced in Sec. 1.7. Assuming with Einstein that light velocity is unaffected\nby an inertial transformation, the passive kinematic group that leaves Eq's (1) - (3) invariant is the\nLorentz group.\n\nThere are few if any principles in physics which are as thoroughly justified by their implications as\nthe principle of Lorentz invariance. Our objective is to develop these implications in a systematic\nfashion.\nIn the early days of relativity the consequences of Lorentz invariance involved mostly effects of the\norder of (v/c)2 , a quantity that is small for the velocities attainable at that time. The justification\nis much more dramatic at present when we can refer to the operation of high energy accelerators\noperating near light velocity.\nYet this is not all. Lorentz invariance has many consequences which are valid even in nonrelativistic\nphysics, but classically they require a number of independent postulates for their justification. In\nsuch cases the Lorentz group is used to achieve conceptual economy.\nIn-view of this far-reaching a posteriori verification of the constancy of light velocity, we need not\nbe unduly concerned with its a priori justification. It is nevertheless a puzzling question, and it has\ngiven rise to much speculation: what was Einstein's motivation in advancing this postulate? 11\nEinstein himself gives the following account of a paradox on which he hit at the age of sixteen12:\n\"If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity c (velocity of light in vacuum), I should\nobserve such a beam of light' as a spatially oscillatory electromagnetic field at rest.\nHowever, there seems to be no such thing, whether on the basis of experience or ac\ncording to Maxwell's equations.\"\nThe statement could be actually even sharpened: on overtaking a travelling wave, the resulting\nphenomenon would simply come to rest, rather than turn into a standing wave.\nHowever it may be, if the velocity of propagation were at all affected by the motion of the ob\nserver, it could be \"transformed away.\" Should we accept such a radical change from an inertial\ntransformation? At least in hindsight, we know that the answer is indeed no.\nNote that the essential point in the above argument is that a light quantum cannot be transformed\nto rest. This absence of a preferred rest system with respect to the photon does not exclude the\nexistence of a preferred frame defined from other considerations. Thus it has been recently sug\ngested that a preferred frame be defined by the requirement that the 3K radiation be isotropic in it\n[Wei72].\nSince Einstein and his contemporaries emphasized the absence of any preferred frame of reference,\none might have wondered whether the aforementioned radiation, or some other cosmologically\ndefined frame,might cause difficulties in the theory of relativity.\nOur formulation, based on weaker assumptions, shows that such concern is unwarranted.\n11*See Gerald Holton, Einstein, Michelson and \"Crucial\" Experiment, in Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought.\nKepler to Einstein. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1973, pp 261-352.\n\nWe observe finally, that we have considered thus far primarily wave kinematics, with no reference\nto the electrodynamic interpretation of light. This is only a tactical move. We propose to derive\nclassical electrodynamics (CED) within our scheme, rather than suppose its validity.\nProblems of angular momentum and polarization are also left for later inclusion.\nHowever, we are ready to widen our context by being more explicit with respect to the properties\nof the four-momentum.\nEq (5) provides us with a definition of the four-momentum, but only for the case of the photon,\nthat is for a particle with zero rest mass and the velocity c.\nThis relation is easily generalized to massive particles that can be brought to rest. We make use of\nthe fact that the Lorentz transformation leaves the left-hand side of Eq (5) invariant, whether or not\nit vanishes. Therefore we set\npo\n2 - p~ p~ = m 2 c 2\n(3.2.10)\n·\nand define the mass m of a particle as the invariant \"length\" of the four-momentum according to\nthe Minkowski metric (with c = 1).\nWe can now formulate the postulate: The four-momentum is conserved. This principle includes\nthe conservation of energy and that of the three momentum components. It is to be applied to the\ninteraction between the photon and a massive particle and also to collision processes in general.\nIn order to make use of the conservation law, we need explicit expressions for the velocity depen\ndence of the four-momentum components. These shall be obtained from the study of the Lorentz\ngroup.\n3.3 On circular and hyperbolic rotations\nWe propose to develop a unified formalism for dealing with the Lorentz group SO(3, 1) and its\nsubgroup SO(3). This program can be divided into two stages. First, consider a Lorentz transfor\nmation as a hyperbolic rotation, and exploit the analogies between circular and hyperbolic trigono\nmetric functions, and also of the corresponding exponentials. This simple idea is developed in this\nsection in terms of the subgroups SO(2) and SO(1, 1). The rest of this chapter is devoted to the\ngeneralization of these results to three spatial dimensions in terms of a matrix formalism.\nLet us consider a two-component vector in the Euclidean plane:\n~x = x1eˆ1 + x2eˆ2\n(3.3.1)\nWe are interested in the transformations that leave x1\n2 + x2\n2 invariant. Let us write\nx1\n2 + x 2 = (x1 + ix2) (x1 - ix2)\n(3.3.2)\n\nand set\n(x1 + ix2)0 = a(x1 + ix2)\n(3.3.3)\n(x1 - ix2)0 = a∗(x1 - ix2)\n(3.3.4)\nwhere the star means conjugate complex. For invariance we have\naa∗ = 1\n(3.3.5)\nor\na = exp(-iφ) ,\na∗ = exp(iφ)\n(3.3.6)\nFrom these formulas we easily recover the elementary trigonometric expressions. Table 3.1 sum\nmarizes the presentations of rotational transformations in terms of exponentials, trigonometric\nfunctions and algebraic irrationalities involving the slope of the axes. There is little to recommend\nthe use of the latter, however it completes the parallel with Lorentz transformations where this\nparametrization is favored by tradition.\nWe emphasize the advantages of the exponential function, mainly because it lends itself to iteration,\nwhich is apparent from the well known formula of de Moivre:\nexp(inφ) = cos(nφ) + i sin(nφ) = (cos(φ) + i sin(φ))n\n(3.3.7)\nThe same Table contains also the parametrization of the Lorentz group in one spatial variable. The\nanalogy between SO(2) and SO(1, 1) is far reaching and the Table is selfexplanatory. Yet there\nare a number of additional points which are worth making.\nThe invariance of\nx0\n2 - x3\n2 = (x0 + x3) (x0 - x3)\n(3.3.8)\nis ensured by\n(x0 + x3)0 = a(x0 + x3)\n(3.3.9)\n(x0 - x3)0 = a-1(x0 - x3)\n(3.3.10)\nfor an arbitrary a. By setting a = exp(-μ) in the Table we tacitly exclude negative values.\nAdmitting a negative value for this parameter would imply the interchange of future and past. The\nLorentz transformations which leave the direction of time invariant, are called orthochronic. Until\nfurther notice these are the only ones we shall consider.\nThe meaning of the parameter μ is apparent from the well known relation\nv\ntanh μ =\n= β\n(3.3.11)\nc\nwhere v is the velocity of the primed system Σ0 measured in Σ. Being a (non-Euclidean) measure\nof a velocity, μ is sometimes called rapidity, or velocity parameter.\n\nRotation\n(x1 - ix2)0 = eiφ(x1 - ix2)\n(x1 + ix2)0 = e-iφ(x1 + ix2)\nx0\n1 = x1 cos φ + x2 sin φ\nx0\n2 = -x1 sin φ + x2 cos φ\nx0\n1 = x1+κx2\n√\n1+κ2\nκx1+x2\nx0\n2 = √\n1+κ2\nκ = tan φ =\nx2\nx1 x0\n2 = 0\n= -\nx\nx\nx2 = 0\nX2 = tan θ\nx1\nθ0 = θ - φ\nLorentz Transformation\n(x0 + x3)0 = e-μ(x0 + x3)\n(x0 - x3)0 = eμ(x0 - x3)\nx0\n3 = x3 cosh μ - x0 sinh μ\nx0\n0 = -x3 sinh μ + x0 cosh μ\nx0\n3 = x3-βx0\n√\n1-β2\nx0\n0 = -√\nβx\n-\n+\nβ\nx\nβ = tanh μ =\nx\nx\n3 x0\n3 = 0\n=\nx\nx3\nx3 = 0 ,\nx0 = ct\nX3 = tanh ν\nx0\nν0 = ν - μ\nTable 3.1: Summary of the rotational transformations. (The signs of the angles correspond to the\npassive interpretation.)\n\nFigure 3.1: Area in (x0, x3)-plane.\nWe shall refer to μ also as hyperbolic angle. The formal analogy with the circular angle φ\nis evident from the Table. We deepen this parallel by means of the observation that μ can be\ninterpreted as an area in the (x0, x3) plane (see Figure 3.1).\nConsider a hyperbola with the equation\nx0\nx3\n= 1\n(3.3.12)\na\n-\nb\nx0 = a cosh μ\nx3 = b sinh μ\n(3.3.13)\nThe shaded triangular area (shown in Figure 3.1) is according to Equation 2.6.2 of Section 2.6:\nx3 + dx3 x3\nx0 + dx0 x0\n= 1 (x0dx3 - x3dx0) =\n(3.3.14)\nab\nab\n(3.3.15)\ncosh μ - sinh μ d =\ndμ\nWe could proceed similarly for the circular angle φ and define it in terms of the area of a circular\nsector, rather than an arc. However, only the area can be generalized for the hyperbola.\nAlthough the formulas in Table 3.1 apply also to the wave vector and the four momentum.and can\nbe used in each case also according to the active interpretation, the various situations have their\nindividual features, some of which will now be surveyed.\nConsider at first a plane wave the direction of propagation of which makes an angle θ with the\ndirection x3 of the Lorentz transformation. We write the phase, Equation 3.3.11 of Section 3.2, as\n1 [(k0 + k3)(x0 - x3) + (k0 - k3)(x0 + x3)] - k1x1 - k2x2\n(3.3.16)\n\nThis expression is invariant if (k0 ± k3) transforms by the same factor exp(±μ) as (x0 ± x3).\nThus we have\nk0\n= k3 cosh μ - k0 sinh μ\n(3.3.17)\nk0\n= -k3 sinh μ + k0 cosh μ\n(3.3.18)\nSince (k0,~k) is a null-vector, i.e., k has vanishing length, we set\nk3 = k0 cos θ,\nk3\n0 = k0\n0 cos θ0\n(3.3.19)\nand we obtain for the aberration and the Doppler effect:\ncos θ0 = cos θ cosh μ - sinh μ = cos θ - β\n(3.3.20)\ncosh μ - cos θ sinh μ\n1 - β cos θ\nand\nk0\nω0\n=\n= cosh μ - cos θ sinh μ\n(3.3.21)\nk0\nω0\nFor cos θ = 1 we have\ns\nω0\n= exp(-μ) =\n1 - β\n(3.3.22)\nω0\n1 + β\nThus the hyperbolic angle is directly connected with the frequency scaling in the Doppler effect.\nNext, we turn to the transformation of the four-momentum of a massive particle. The new feature\nis that such a particle can be brought to rest. Let us say the particle is at rest in the frame Σ0 (rest\nframe), that moves with the velocity v3 = c tanh-1 μ in the frame Σ (lab frame). Thus v3 can be\nidentified as the particle velocity along x3.\nSolving for the momentum in Σ:\np3 = p0\n3 cosh μ + p0\n0 sinh μ\n(3.3.23)\np0 = p0\n3 sinh μ + p0\n0 cosh μ\n(3.3.24)\nwith p0\n3 = 0, p0\n0 = mc, we have\nmcβ\np3\n= mc sinh μ = p\n(3.3.25)\n1 - β2\nmc\nE\np0\n= mc cosh μ = p\n= c\n1 - β2\nγ = cosh μ,\nγβ = sinh μ\n(3.3.26)\n\nThus we have solved the problem posed at the end of Section 3.2.\nThe point in the preceding argument is that we achieve the transition from a state of rest of a particle\nto a state of motion, by the kinematic means of inertial transformation. Evidently, the same effect\ncan be achieved by means of acceleration due to a force, and consider this \"boost\" as an active\nLorentz transformation. Let us assume that the particle carries the charge e and is exposed to a\nconstant electric intensity E. We get from Equantion 3.3.25 for small velocities:\ndp3\ndt = mc cosh μ dμ\ndt ' mc dμ\ndt\n(3.3.27)\nand this agrees with the classical equation of motion if\nE = mc\ne\ndμ\ndt\n(3.3.28)\nThus the electric intensity is proportional to the hyperbolic angular velocity.\nIn close analogy, a circular motion can be produced by a magnetic field:\nmc dφ\nmc\nB = - e dt = - e ω\n(3.3.29)\nThis is the well known cyclotron relation.\nThe foregoing results are noteworthy for a number of reasons. They suggest a close connection\nbetween electrodynamics and the Lorentz group and indicate how the group theoretical method\nprovides us with results usually obtained by equations of motion.\nAll this brings us a step closer to our program of establishing much of physics within a group\ntheoretical framework, starting in particular with the Lorentz group. However, in order to carry out\nthis program we have to generalize our technique to three spatial dimensions. For this we have the\nchoice between two methods.\nThe first is to represent a four-vector as a 4 × 1 column matrix and operate on it by 4 × 4 matrices\ninvolving 16 real parameters among which there are ten relations (see Section 2.5).\nThe second approach is to map four-vectors on Hermitian 2 × 2 matrices\n\nP =\np0 + p3\np1 + ip2\np1 - ip2\np0 - p3\n(3.3.30)\nand represent Lorentz transformations as\nP 0 = V P V +\n(3.3.31)\nwhere V and V + are Hermitian adjoint unimodular matrices depending .just on the needed six\nparameters.\n\nWe choose the second alternative and we shall show that the mathematical parameters have the\ndesired simple physical interpretations. In particular we shall arrive at generalizations of the de\nMoivre relation, Equation 3.3.7.\nThe balance of this chapter is devoted to the mathematical theory of the 2×2 matrices with physical\napplications to electrodynamics following in Section 4.\n\n3.4 The Pauli Algebra\n3.4.1 Introduction\nLet us consider the set of all 2 × 2 matrices with complex elements. The usual definitions of ma\ntrix addition and scalar multiplication by complex numbers establish this set as a four-dimensional\nvector space over the field of complex numbers V(4, C). With ordinary matrix multiplication, the\nvector space becomes, what is called an algebra, in the technical sense explained at the end of\nSection 2.3. The nature of matrix multiplication ensures that this algebra, to be denoted A2, is as\nsociative and noncommutative, properties which are in line with the group-theoretical applications\nwe have in mind.\nThe name \"Pauli algebra\" stems, of course, from the fact that A2 was first introduced into physics\nby Pauli, to fit the electron spin into the formalism of quantum mechanics. Since that time the\napplication of this technique has spread into most branches of physics.\nFrom the point of view of mathematics, A2 is merely a special case of the algebra An of n × n\nmatrices, whereby the latter are interpreted as transformations over a vector space V(n2, C). Their\nreduction to canonical forms is a beautiful part of modern linear algebra.\nWhereas the mathematicians do not give special attention to the case n = 2, the physicists13,\ndealing with four-dimensional space-time, have every reason to do so, and it turns out to be most\nrewarding to develop procedures and proofs for the special case rather than refer to the general\nmathematical theorems. The technique for such a program has been developed some years ago14.\nThe resulting formalism is closely related to the algebra of complex quaternions, and has been\ncalled accordingly a system of hypercomplex numbers. The study of the latter goes back to Hamil\nton, but the idea has been considerably developed in recent years15. The suggestion that the matri\nces (1) are to be considered symbolically as generalizations of complex numbers which still retain\n\"number-like\" properties, is appealing, and we shall make occasional use of it. Yet it seems con\nfining to make this into the central guiding principle. The use of matrices harmonizes better with\nthe usual practice of physics and mathematics16\nIn the forthcoming systematic development of this program we shall evidently cover much ground\nthat is well known, although some of the proofs and concepts of Whitney and Tisza do not seem\nto be used elsewhere. However, the main distinctive feature of the present approach is that we do\nnot apply the formalism to physical theories assumed to be given, but develop the geometrical,\nkinematic and dynamic applications in close parallel with the building up of the formalism.\n13However, see [Ebe65].\n14[Whi68]. Also unpublished reports by Tisza and Whitney.\n15See particularly a series of papers by J. D. Edmonds: [Edm73a, Edm75, Edm74b, Edm74a, Edm73b, Edm72].\nAlso, [Jam74] for the references to the early literature.\n16For a development of the matrix method see also [Fro75].\n\nSince our discussion is meant to be self-contained and economical, we use references only spar\ningly. However, at a later stage we shall state whatever is necessary to ease the reading of the\nliterature.\n3.4.2 Basic Definitions and Procedures\nWe consider the set A2 of all 2 × 2 complex matrices\nA =\na11 a12\n(3.4.1)\na21 a22\nAlthough one can generate A2 from the basis\ne1 =\n(3.4.2)\ne2 =\n(3.4.3)\ne3 =\n(3.4.4)\ne4 =\n(3.4.5)\nin which case the matrix elements are the expansion coefficients, it is often more convenient to\ngenerate it from a basis formed by the Pauli matrices augmented by the unit matrix.\nAccordingly A2 is called the Pauli algebra. The basis matrices are\nσ0 = I =\n(3.4.6)\nσ1 =\n(3.4.7)\nσ2 =\n0 -i\n(3.4.8)\ni\nσ3 =\n(3.4.9)\n0 -1\nThe three Pauli matrices satisfy the well known multiplication rules\nσj\n2 =\n1 j = 1, 2, 3\n(3.4.10)\nσj σk = -σkσj = iσl\nj k l = 1 2 3 or an even permutation thereof\n(3.4.11)\n\nX\n\nμ\n\nAll of the basis matrices are Hermitian, or self-adjoint:\nσμ\n+ = σμ\nμ = 0, 1, 2, 3\n(3.4.12)\n(By convention, Roman and Greek indices will run from one to three and from zero to three,\nrespectively.)\nWe shall represent the matrix A of Equation 3.4.1 as a linear combination of the basis matrices with\nthe coefficient of σμ denoted by aμ. We shall refer to the numbers aμ as the components of the\nmatrix A. As can be inferred from the multiplication rules, Equation 3.4.11 , matrix components\nare obtained from matrix elements by means of the relation\naμ = 2 T r (Aσμ)\n(3.4.13)\nwhere Tr stands for trace. In detail,\na0 = 1\n2 (a11 + a22)\n(3.4.14)\na1 = 1\n2 (a12 + a21)\n(3.4.15)\na2 = 1\n2 (a12 - a21)\n(3.4.16)\na3 = 1\n2 (a11 - a22)\n(3.4.17)\nIn practical applications we shall often see that a matrix is best represented in one context by its\ncomponents, but in another by its elements. It is convenient to have full flexibility to choose at\nwill between the two. A set of four components aμ, denoted by {aμ}, will often be broken into a\ncomplex scalar a0 and a complex \"vector\"17 {a1, a2, a3} = ~a. Similarly, the basis matrices of A2\nwill be denoted by σ0 = 1 and {σ1, σ2, σ3} = ~σ. With this notation,\nA =\naμσμ = a01 + ~a ~σ\n(3.4.18)\n·\n=\na0 + a3\na1 - ia2\n(3.4.19)\na1 + ia2\na0 - a3\nWe associate with .each matrix the half trace and the determinant\n1 T rA = a0\n(3.4.20)\n|A| = a0\n2 - ~a 2\n(3.4.21)\n17The term \"vector\" here merely signifies a three-component object with which, in a formal way, one can perform\nthe dot and cross products of vector calculus. The term does not refer to the transformation properties to be taken up\nin Section 3.4.3.\n\nThe extent to which these numbers specify the properties of the matrix A, will be apparent from\nthe discussion of their invariance properties in the next two subsections. The positive square root\nof the determinant is in a way the norm of the matrix. Its nonvanishing: |A| =6\n0, is the criterion\nfor A to be invertible.\nSuch matrices can be normalized to become unimodular:\nA →|A|-1/2A\n(3.4.22)\nThe case of singular matrices\n|A| = a0\n2 - ~a 2 = 0\n(3.4.23)\ncalls for comment. We call matrices for which |A| = 0, but A = 0\n, null-matrices. Because of their\noccurrence, A2 is not a division algebra. This is in contrast, say, with the set of real quaternions\nwhich is a division algebra, since the norm vanishes only for the vanishing quaternion.\nThe fact that null-matrices are important,stems partly from the indefinite Minkowski metric. How\never, entirely different applications will be considered later.\nWe list now some practical rules for operations in A2, presenting them in terms of matrix compo\nnents rather than the more familiar matrix elements.\nTo perform matrix multiplications we shall make use of a formula implied by the multiplication\nrules, Equantion 3.4.11:\n\n(~a ~σ) ~b ~σ = ~a ~bI + i ~a × ~b\n~σ\n(3.4.24)\n·\n·\n·\n·\nwhere ~a and ~b are complex vectors.\nEvidently, for any two matrices A and B\n[A, B] = AB - BA = 2i ~a × ~b\n~σ\n(3.4.25)\n·\nThe matrices A and B commute, if and only if\n~a × ~b = 0\n(3.4.26)\nthat is, if the vector parts ~a and ~b are \"parallel\" or at least one of them vanishes.\nIn addition to the internal operations of addition and multiplication, there are external operations on\nA2 as a whole, which are analogous to complex conjugation. The latter operation is an involution,\nwhich means that (z∗)∗ = z. Of the three involutions any two can be considered independent.\nIn A2 we have two independent involutions which can be applied jointly to yield a third:\nA\nA = a0I + ~a ~σ\n(3.4.27)\n→\n·\nA\nA+ = a∗\n0I + ~a∗ ~σ\n(3.4.28)\n→\n·\nA → A = a0I - ~a · ~σ\n(3.4.29)\nA → A + = A = a0\n∗I - ~a∗ · ~σ\n(3.4.30)\n\nn\no\nThe matrix A+ is the Hermitian adjoint of A. Unfortunately, there is neither an agreed symbol,\nnor a term for A . Whitney called it Pauli conjugate, other terms are quaternionic conjugate or\nhyper-conjugate A++ (see Edwards, l.c.). Finally A is called complex reflection.\nIt is easy to verify the rules\n(AB)+ = B+A+\n(3.4.31)\n\n= B\n(3.4.32)\nAB\nA\n\nAB\n= BA\n(3.4.33)\nAccording to Equantion 3.4.33 the operation of complex reflection maintains the product relation in\nA2, it is an automorphism. In contrast, the Hermitian and Pauli conjugations are anti-automorphic.\nIt is noteworthy that the three operations , + , , together with the identity operator, form a group\n(the four-group, \"Vierergruppe\"). This is a mark of closure: we presumably left out no important\noperator on the algebra.\nIn various contexts any of the three conjugations appears as a generalization of ordinary complex\nconjugation 18.\nHere are a few applications of the conjugation rules.\nAA = a 2\n0 - ~a 2 1 = |A|1\n(3.4.34)\nFor invertible matrices\nA\nA-1 =\n(3.4.35)\n|A|\nFor unimodular matrices we have the useful rule:\nA-1 = A\n(3.4.36)\nA Hermitian marrix A = A+ has real components h0,~h. We define a matrix to be positive if it is\nHermitian and has a positive trace and determinant:\nh0 > 0,\n|H| = h0\n2 - ~h2 > 0\n(3.4.37)\nIf H is positive and unimodular, it can be parametrized as\nH = cosh(μ/2)1 + sinh(μ/2)hˆ ~σ = exp (μ/2) hˆ ~σ\n(3.4.38)\n·\n·\n18In the literature one often considers the conjugation of matrix, by taking the complex conjugates of the elements:\naik → a∗ . This is the case in the well known spinor formalism of van der Waerden. We shall discuss the relation to\nik\nthis formalism in connection with relativistic spinors. However we note already that this convention is asymmetric in\nthe sense that σ1\n∗ = σ1, σ2\n∗ = -σ2.\n\nThe matrix exponential is defined by a power series that reduces to the trigonometric expression.\nThe factor 1/2 appears only for convenience in the next subsection.\nIn the Pauli algebra, the usual definition U + = U -1 for a unitary matrix takes the form\nu∗\n01 + ~u∗ · ~σ = |U|-1 (u01 - ~u · ~σ)\n(3.4.39)\nIf U is also unimodular, then\nu∗\n0 = u0 = real\n(3.4.40)\n~u∗ = ~u = imaginary\n(3.4.41)\nand\nu 2\n0 - ~u ~u = u 2\n0 + ~u ~u∗ = 1\n·\n·\nU = cos(φ/2)1 - i sin(φ/2)ˆu ~σ = exp (-i(φ/2)ˆu ~σ)\n(3.4.42)\n·\n·\nA unitary unimodular matrix can be represented also in terms of elements\nU =\nξ0 -ξ1\n∗\n(3.4.43)\nξ1\nξ0\n∗\nwith\n|ξ0|2 + |ξ1|2 = 1\n(3.4.44)\nwhere ξ0, ξ1, are the so-called Cayley-Klein parameters. We shall see that both this form, and the\naxis-angle representation, Equation 3.4.42, are useful in the proper context.\nWe turn now to the category of normal matrices N defined by the condition that they commute\nwith their Hermitian adjoint: N +N = NN +. Invoking the condition, Equation 3.4.26 , we have\n~n × ~n∗ = 0\n(3.4.45)\nimplying that n∗ is proportional to n, that is all the components of ~n must have the same phase.\nNormal matrices are thus of the form\nN = n01 + nnˆ ~σ\n(3.4.46)\n·\nwhere n0 and n are complex constants and hatn is a real unit vector, which we call the axis of N.\nIn particular, any unimodular normal matrix can be expressed as\nN = cosh(κ/2)1 + sinh(κ/2)ˆn ~σ = exp ((κ/2)ˆn ~σ)\n(3.4.47)\n·\n·\nwhere κ = μ - iφ, -inf < μ < inf, 0 ≤ φ < 4π , and nˆ is a real unit vector. If nˆ points in the \"3\"\ndirection, we have\n\nhκ\ni\nexp(κ )\nN0 = exp\nσ3 =\nκ\n(3.4.48)\nexp(-)\n\nThus the matrix exponentials, Equations 3.4.38, 3.4.42 and 3.4.48, are generalizations of a diagonal\nmatrix and the latter is distinguished by the requirement that the axis points in the z direction.\nClearly the normal matrix, Equation 3.4.48, is a commuting product of a positive matrix like Equa\ntion 3.4.38 with hˆ = nˆ and a unitary matrix like Equation 3.4.42, with uˆ = nˆ:\nN = HU = UH\n(3.4.49)\nThe expressions in Equation 3.4.49 are called the polar forms of N, the name being chosen to\nsuggest that the representation of N by H and U is analogous to the representation of a complex\nnumber z by a positive number r and a phase factor:\nz = r exp(-iφ/2)\n(3.4.50)\nWe shall show that, more generally, any invertible matrix has two unique polar forms\nA = HU = UH0\n(3.4.51)\nbut only the polar forms of normal matrices display the following equivalent special features:\n1. H and U commute\n2. hˆ = uˆ = nˆ\n3. H0 = H\nWe see from the polar decomposition theorem that our emphasis on positive and unitary matrices\nis justified, since all matrices of A2 can be produced from such factors. We proceed now to prove\nthe theorem expressed in Equation 3.4.51 by means of an explicit construction.\nFirst we form the matrix AA+, which is positive by the criteria 3.4.36:\na0a∗\n0 + ~a ~a∗ > 0\n(3.4.52)\n·\n|A||A+| > 0\n(3.4.53)\nLet AA+ be expressed in terms of an axis ˆh and the hyperbolic angle μ:\nAA+ = b cosh μ1 + sinh μhˆ σˆ\n·\n= b exp(μhˆ σˆ)\n(3.4.54)\n·\nwhere b is a positive constant. We claim that the Hermitian component of A is the positive square\nroot of 3.4.54\nˆ\nH =\n\nAA+ 1/2 = b1/2 exp(μh σˆ)\n(3.4.55)\n2 ·\n\nwith\nU = H-1A,\nA = HU\n(3.4.56)\nThat U is indeed unitary is easily verified:\nU + = A+H-1 ,\nU -1 = A-1H\n(3.4.57)\nand these expressions are equal by Equation 3.4.55.\nFrom Equation 3.4.56 we get\nA = U(U -1HU)\nand\nA = UH0\nwith H0 = U -1HU\n(3.4.58)\nIt remains to be shown that the polar forms 3.4.56 are unique. Suppose indeed, that for a particular\nA we have two factorizations\nA = HU = H1U1\n(3.4.59)\nthen\nAA+ = H2 = H1\n(3.4.60)\nBut, since AA+ has a unique positive square root, H1 = H, and\nU = H1\n-1A = H-1A = U\nq.e.d.\n(3.4.61)\nPolar forms are well known to exist for any n × n matrix, although proofs of uniqueness are\ngenerally formulated for abstract transformations rather than for matrices, and require that the\ntransformations be invertable 19.\n3.4.3 The restricted Lorentz group\nHaving completed the classification of the matrices of A2, we are ready to interpret them as opera\ntors and establish a connection with the Lorentz group. The straightforward procedure would be to\nintroduce a 2-dimensional complex vector space V(∈, C). By using the familiar bra-ket formalism\nwe write\nA|ξi = |ξ0i\n(3.4.62)\nA+hξ| = hξ0|\n(3.4.63)\nThe two-component complex vectors are commonly called spinors. We shall study their properties\nin detail in Section 5. The reason for this delay is that the physical interpretation of spinors is a\n19See [Hal58], page 170, and [Gel61], page 111. The theorem is stated only partially by Halmos as A = UH0,\nand by Gel'fand in the weak form A = HU = U 0H0 without stating U = U 0. See also [HK61], page 343. For an\nextension of the theorem to singular matrices see [Whi71].\n\nsubtle problem with many ramifications. One is well advised to consider at first situations in which\nthe object to be operated upon can be represented by a 2 × 2 matrix.\nThe obvious choice is to consider Hermitian matrices, the components of which are interpreted as\nrelativistic four-vectors. The connection between four-vectors and matrices is so close that it is\noften convenient to use the same symbol for both:\nA = a01 + ~a ~σ\n(3.4.64)\n·\nA = {a0,~a}\n(3.4.65)\nWe have\na0\n2 - ~a 2 = |A| = 2\n1 Tr(AA )\n(3.4.66)\nor more generally\na0b0 - ~a ~b = 1 Tr(AB )\n(3.4.67)\n·\nA Lorentz transformation is defined as a linear transformation\n{a0,~a} = L{a0\n0,~a0}\n(3.4.68)\nthat leaves the expression 3.4.67 and hence also 3.4.66 invariant. We require moreover that the\nsign of the \"time component\" a0 be invariant (orthochronic Lorentz transformation L↑), and that\nthe determinant of the 4x4 matrix L be positive (proper Lorentz transformation L+). If both\nconditions are satisfied, we speak of the restricted Lorentz group L↑. This is the only one to be of\n+\ncurrent interest for us, and until further notice \"Lorentz group\" is to be interpreted in this restricted\nsense.\nNote that A can be interpreted as any of the four-vectors discussed in Section 3.2: R = {r, ~r},\nK = {k0,~k},\nP = {p0, ~p}\n(3.4.69)\nAlthough these vectors and their matrix equivalents have identical transformation properties, they\ndiffer in the possible range of their determinants. A negative |P | can arise only for an unphysical\nimaginary rest mass. By contrast, a positive R corresponds to a time-like displacement pointing\ntoward the future, an R with a negative |R| to a space-like displacement and |R| = 0 is associated\nwith the light cone. For the wave vector we have by definition |K| = 0.\nTo describe a Lorentz transformation in the Pauli algebra we try the \"ansatz\"\nA0 = V AW\n(3.4.70)\nwith |V | = |W | = 1 in order to preserve |A|. Reality of the vector, i.e., hermiticity of the matrix\nA is preserved if the additional condition W = V + is satisfied. Thus the transformation\nA0 = V AV +\n(3.4.71)\n\nleaves expression 3.4.66 invariant. It is easy to show that 3.4.67 is invariant as well.\nThe complex reflection A transforms as\nA 0 = V A V\n(3.4.72)\nand the product of two four-vectors:\n(AB )0 = V AV +V B V\n= V (AB )V -1\n(3.4.73)\nThis is a so-called similarity transformation. By taking the trace of Equation 3.4.73 we confirm that\nthe inner product 3.4.67 is invariant under 3.4.72. We have to remember that a cyclic permutation\ndoes not affect the trace of a product of matrices 20. Thus Equation 3.4.72 indeed induces a Lorentz\ntransformation in the four-vector space of A.\nIt is well known that the converse statement is also true: to every transformation of the restricted\nLorentz group L↑\n+ there are associated two matrices differing-only by sign (their parameters φ\ndiffer by 2π) in such a fashion as to constitute a two-to-one homomorphism between the group\n+\nof unimodular matrices SL(2, C) and the group L↑. It is said also that SL(2, C) provides a\ntwo-valued representation of L↑\nWe shall prove this statement by demonstrating explicitly the\n+.\nconnection between the matrices V and the induced, or associated group operations.\nWe note first that A and A correspond in the tensor language to the contravariant and the covariant\nrepresentation of a vector. We illustrate the use of the formalism by giving an explicit form for the\ninverse of 3.4.72\nA = V -1A0V +-1\nV A0V\n(3.4.74)\n≡\nWe invoke the polar decomposition theorem Equation 3.4.49 of Section 3.4.2 and note that it is\nsufficient to establish this connection for unitary and positive matrices respectively.\nConsider at first\nA0 = UAU + ≡ UAU -1\n(3.4.75)\nwith\nφ\niφ\nU(ˆu, )\nexp\nuˆ ~σ\n≡\n- 2\n·\nu 2\n1 + u 2\n2 + u 2\n3 = 1,\n0 ≤ φ < 4π\n(3.4.76)\nThe set of all unitary unimodular matrices described by Equation 3.4.76 form a group that is\ncommonly called SU(2).\n20Since for hermitian matrices A = A , we use now A as in Equation 3.4.34 (Section 3.4.2), since in Section 4 A\nwill prove to be of greater generality, and being automorphic, it is easier to handle.\n\nk\n\nLet us decompose ~a:\n~a = ~ak + ~a⊥\n(3.4.77)\n~ak = (~a · uˆ)ˆu,\n~a⊥ = ~a - ~ak = uˆ × (~a × uˆ)\n(3.4.78)\nIt is easy to see that Equation 3.4.75 leaves a0 and a invariant and induces a rotation around uˆ by\nan angle φ: R{ˆu, φ}.\nConversely, to every rotation R{ˆu, φ} there correspond two matrices:\nφ\nφ + 2π\nφ\nU(ˆu, ) and U(ˆu,\n) = -U(ˆu, )\n(3.4.79)\nWe have 1 → 2 homomorphism between SO(3) and SU(2), the latter is said to be a two-valued\nrepresentation of the former. By establishing this correspondence we have solved the problem of\nparametrization formulated on page 13. The nine parameters of the orthogonal 3 × 3 matrices are\nreduced to the three independent ones of U(ˆu, φ\n2 ). Moreover we have the simple result\ninφ\nU n = exp - 2 uˆ · ~σ\n(3.4.80)\nwhich reduces to the de Moivre theorem if nˆ ~σ = σ3.\n·\nSome comment is in order concerning the two-valuedness of the SU(2) representation. This comes\nabout because of the use of half angles in the algebraic formalism which is deeply rooted in the\ngeometrical structure of the rotation group. (See the Rodrigues-Hamilton theorem in Section 2.2.)\nWhereas the two-valuedness of the SU(2) representation does not affect the transformation of the\nA vector based on the bilateral expression 3.4.75, the situation will be seen to be different in the\nspinorial theory based on Equation 3.4.62, since under certain conditions the sign of the spinor |ξi\nis physically meaningful 21.\nThe above discussion of the rotation group is incomplete even within the classical theory. The\nrotation R{ˆ\nu unaffected. A more appropriate object to be rotated is the\nu, φ} leaves vectors along ˆ\nCartesian triad, to be discussed in Section 5.\nWe consider now the case of a positive matrix V = H\nA0 = HAH\n(3.4.81)\nwith\nˆ\nH = exp(μh σ)\n(3.4.82)\n2 ·\nh2\n1 + h2\n2 + h2 = 1,\n-inf < μ < inf\n(3.4.83)\n21Historically, SU(2) was introduced into physics in order to account for the electron spin within quantum mechan\nics. This is a case where the two-valuedness of the formalism is significant, although not too well understood. For this\nreason there is a tendency in the literature to work as long as possible with the single-valued representations involving\n3 × 3 matrices. On closer inspection this turns out to be a false economy.\n\nWe decompose ~a as\n~a = ahˆ + ~a\n(3.4.84)\n⊥\nand using the fact that (~a ~σ) and (~b ~σ) commute for ~ak~b and anticommute for ~a ⊥ ~b, we obtain\n·\n·\nA0 = exp(μhˆ σ) a01 + ahˆ σ + ~a\nσ exp(μhˆ σ)\n(3.4.85)\n2 ·\n·\n\n⊥ ·\n2 ·\n= exp(μhˆ σ) a01 + ~ahˆ σ + ~a\nσ\n(3.4.86)\n·\n·\n⊥ ·\nHence\na0\n0 = cosh μa0 + sinh μa\n(3.4.87)\na0 = sinh μa0 + cosh μa0\n(3.4.88)\n~a0\n= ~a\n(3.4.89)\n⊥\n⊥\nThis is to be compared with Table 3.1, but remember that we have shifted from the passive to the\nactive interpretation, from alias to alibi.\nPositive matrices with a common axis form a group (Wigner's \"little group\"), but in general the\nproduct of Hermitian matrices with different axes are not Hermitian. There arises a unitary factor,\nwhich is the mathematical basis for the famous Thomas precession.\nLet us consider now a normal matrix\nV = N\nk, μ\nk, φ\n2) = exp μ -\niφ ˆ · σ\n= H(ˆ\n)U(ˆ\nn\n(3.4.90)\nwhere we have the commuting product of a rotation and a Lorentz transformation with the same\naxis nˆ. Such a constellation is called a Lorentz 4-screw22.\nAn arbitrary sequence of pure Lorentz transformations and pure rotations is associated with a pair\nof matrices V and -V , which in the general case is of the form\nH(h,\nˆ μ)U(ˆu, φ ) = U(ˆu, φ )H0(hˆ0, μ)\n(3.4.91)\nAccording to Equation 3.4.58 of Section 3.4.2, H and H0 are connected by a similarity transfor\nmation, which does not affect the angle μ, but only the axis of the transformation. (See the next\nsection.)\nThis matrix depends on the 6 parameters, ˆ\nu, φ, and thus we have solved the general problem\nh, μ, ˆ\nof parametrization mentioned above.\nFor a normal matrix hˆ = uˆ = nˆ and the number of parameters is reduced to 4.\n22See [Syn65], page 89.\n\nOur formalism enables us to give a closed form for two arbitrary normal matrices and the corre\nsponding 4-screws.\nκ\nκ\n[N, N 0] = 2i sinh 2 sinh 2 (ˆn × nˆ0) · ~σ\n(3.4.92)\nwhere κ = μ - iφ, κ0 = μ0 - iφ0.\nIn the literature the commutation relations are usually given in terms of infinitesimal operators\nwhich are defined as follows:\ndφ\ni\nU(ˆuk,\n)\n=\n1 - dφσk = 1 + dφIk\n(3.4.93)\ni\nIk = -2 σk\n(3.4.94)\nH(hˆk, dμ) = 1 + dμσk = 1 + dμLk\n(3.4.95)\nLk =\nσk\n(3.4.96)\nThe commutation relations are\n[I1, I2]\n= I3\n(3.4.97)\n[L1, L2]\n= -I3\n(3.4.98)\n[L1, I2]\n= L3\n(3.4.99)\nand cyclic permutations.\nIt is a well known result of the Lie-Cartan theory of continuous group that these infinitesimal-\ngenerators determine the entire group. Since we have represented these generators in SL(2, C),\nwe have completed the demonstration that the entire group L↑is accounted for in our formalism.\n+\n3.4.4 Similarity classes and canonical forms of active transformations\nIt is evident that a Lorentz transformation induced by a matrix H(ˆ\n2 ) assumes a particularly\nh, μ\nsimple form if the z-axis of the coordinate system is placed in the direction of hˆ. The diagonal\nmatrix H(ˆz, μ\n2 ) is said to be the canonical form of the transformation. This statement is a special\ncase of the problem of canonical forms of linear transformations, an important chapter in linear\nalgebra.\nLet us consider a linear mapping in a vector space. A particular choice of basis leads to a matrix\nrepresentation of the mapping, and representations associated with different frames are connected\nby similarity transformations. Let A1, be an arbitrary and S an invertible matrix. A similarity\ntransformation is effected on A, by\nA2 = SA1S-1\n(3.4.100)\n\nMatrices related by similarity transformation are called similar, and matrices similar to each other\nconstitute a similarity class.\nIn usual practice the mapping-refers to a vector space as in Equation 3.4.62 of Section 3.4.3:\nA1|ξi1 = |ξ0i1\n(3.4.101)\nThe subscript refers to the basis \"1.\" A change of basis Σ1 → Σ2 is expressed as\n|ξi2 = S|ξi1,\n|ξ0i2 = S|ξ0i1\n(3.4.102)\nInserting into Equation 3.4.101 we obtain\nA1S-1|ξi2 = S-1|ξi2\n(3.4.103)\nand hence\nA2|ξi2 = |ξi2\n(3.4.104)\nwhere A2 is indeed given by Equation 3.4.100.\nThe procedure we have followed thus far to represent Lorentz transformations in A2 does not quite\nfollow this standard pattern.\nWe have been considering mappings of the space of fourvectors which in turn were represented\nas 2 × 2 complex matrices. Thus both operators and operands are matrices of A2. In spite of this\ndifference in interpretation, the matrix representations in different frames are still related according\nto Equation 3.4.100.\nThis can be shown as follows. Consider a unimodular matrix A, that induces a Lorentz transfor\nmation in P -space, whereby the matrices refer to the basis Σ1:\nP1\n0 = A1P1A+\n(3.4.105)\nWe interpret Equation 3.4.105 in the active sense as a linear mapping of P -space on itself that\ncorresponds physically to some dynamic process that alters P in a linear way.\nWe shall see in Section 4 that the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle during the time dt can\nbe indeed considered as an active Lorentz transformation. (See also page 26.)\nThe process has a physical meaning independent of the frame of the observer, but the matrix\nrepresentations of P, P 0 and of A depend on the frame. The four-momenta in the two frames are\nconnected by a Lorentz transformation interpreted in the passive sense:\nP2 = SP1S+\n(3.4.106)\nP2 = SP 1\n0S+\n(3.4.107)\nwith |S| = 1. Solving for P, P 0 and inserting into Equation 3.4.105, we obtain\nS-1P2\n0S + = A1S-1P2S +A+\n1S\n(3.4.108)\n\nor\nP2\n0 = A2P2A+\n(3.4.109)\nwhere A2 and A1 are again connected by the similarity transformation 3.4.100.\nWe may apply the polar decomposition theorem to the matrix S. In the special case that S is unitary,\nwe speak of a unitary similarity transformation corresponding to the rotation of the coordinate\nsystem discussed at the onset of this section. However, the general case will lead us to less obvious\nphysical applications.\nThe above considerations provide sufficient motivation to examine the similarity classes of A2.\nWe shall see that all of them have physical applications, although the interpretation of singular\nmappings will be discussed only later.\nThe similarity classes can be characterized in several convenient ways. For example, one may use\ntwo independent similarity invariants shared by all the matrices A = a0l + ~a ~σ in the class. We\n·\nshall find it convenient to choose\n1. the determinant |A|, and\n2. the quantity ~a2\nThe trace is also a similarity invariant, but it is not independent: a0\n2 = |A| + ~a2 .\nAlternatively, one can characterize the whole class by one representative member of it, some matrix\nA0 called the canonical form for the class (See Table 3.2).\nWe proceed at first to characterize the similarity classes in terms of the invariants 1 and 2. We\nrecall that a matrix A is invertible if |A| =6\n0 and singular if |A| = 0. Without significant loss\nof generality, we can normalize the invertible matrices of A2 to be unimodular, so that we need\ndiscuss only classes of singular and of unimodular matrices. As a second invariant to characterize\na class, we choose ~a · ~a, and we say that a matrix A is axial if ~a · ~a 6= 0. In this case, there exists a\nunit vector aˆ (possibly complex) such that ~a = a aˆ where a is a complex constant. The unit vector\n·\naˆ is called the axis of A. Conversely, the matrix A is non-axial if ~a ~a = 0, the vector ~a is called\n·\nisotropic or a null-vector, it cannot be expressed in terms of an axis.\nThe concept of axis as here defined is the generalization of the real axis introduced in connection\nwith normal matrices on page 33. The usefulness of this concept is apparent from the following\ntheorem:\nTheorem 1. For any two unit vectors vˆ1, and vˆ2, real or complex, there exists a matrix S such that\nvˆ2 · ~σ = Svˆ1 · ~σS1\n(3.4.110)\nProof. We construct one such matrix S from the following considerations. If vˆ1, and vˆ2 are real,\nthen let S be the unitary matrix that rotates every vector by an angle π about an axis which bisects\nthe angle between vˆ1, and vˆ2:\nS = -isˆ ~σ\n(3.4.111)\n·\n\nwhere\nsˆ =\nvˆ1 + ˆv2\n(3.4.112)\n√2ˆv1 · vˆ2 + 2\nEven if vˆ1, and vˆ2 are not real, it is easily verified that S as given formally by Equations 3.4.111\nand 3.4.112, does indeed send vˆ1 to vˆ2. Naturally S is not unique; for instance, any matrix of the\nform\n\nS = exp\nμ\n2 - iφ\n~v2 · ~σ (-isˆ · ~σ) exp\nμ\n1 - iφ\n~v1 · ~σ\n(3.4.113)\nwill send vˆ1 to vˆ2.\nThis construction fails only if\nvˆ1 · vˆ2 + 1 = 0\n(3.4.114)\nthat is for the transformation vˆ1 →-vˆ2. In this trivial case we choose\nS = -isˆ ~σ,\nwhere sˆ ⊥ ~v1\n(3.4.115)\n·\nSince in the Pauli algebra diagonal matrices are characterized by the fact that their axis is xˆ3, we\nhave proved the following theorem:\nTheorem 2. All axial matrices are diagonizable, but normal matrices and only normal matrices\nare diagonizable by a unitary similarity transformation.\nThe diagonal forms are easily ascertained both for singular and the unimodular cases. (See Ta\nble 3.2.) Because of their simplicity they are called also canonical forms. Note that they can be\nmultiplied by any complex number in order to get all of the axial matrices of A2.\nThe situation is now entirely clear: the canonical forms show the nature of the mapping; a unitary\nsimilarity transformation merely changes the geometrical orientation of the axis. The angle of\ncircular and hyperbolic rotation specified by a0 is invariant. A general transformation complexifies\nthe axis. This situation comes about if in the polar form of the matrix A = HU, the factors have\ndistinct real axes, and hence do not commute.\nThere remains to deal with the case of nonaxial matrices. Consider A = ~a ~σ with ~a2 = 0. Let us\n·\ndecompose the isotropic vector ~a into real and imaginary parts:\n~a = α~ + iβ~\n(3.4.116)\nHence α~ 2 - β~2 = 0 and α β = 0. Since the real and the imaginary parts of a are perpendicular,\n·\nwe can rotate these directions by a unitary similarity transformation into the x- and y-directions\nrespectively. The transformed matrix is\n\nα\n2 (σ1 + iσ2) =\nα\n(3.4.117)\n\nwith a positive. A further similarity transformation with\nα-1/2\nS =\nα1/2\n(3.4.118)\ntransforms Equation 3.4.117 into the canonical form given in Table 3.2.\nAs we have seen in Section 3.4.3 all unimodular matrices induce Lorentz transformations in\nMinkowski, or four-momentum space. According to the results summarized in Table 3.2, the\nmappings induced by axial matrices can be brought by similarity transformations into so-called\nLorentz four-screws consisting of a circular and hyperbolic rotation around the same axis, or in\nother words: a rotation around an axis, and a boost along the same axis.\nWhat about the Lorentz transformation induced by a nonaxial matrix? The nature of these trans\nformations is very different from the common case, and constitutes an unusual limiting situation.\nIt is justified to call it an exceptional Lorentz transformation. The special status of these transfor\nmations was recognized by Wigner in his fundamental paper on the representations of the Lorentz\ngroup23.\nThe present approach is much more elementary than Wigner's, both from the point of view of\nmathematical technique, and also the purpose in mind. Wigner uses the standard algebraic tech\nnique of elementary divisors to establish the canonical Jordan form of matrices. We use, instead\na specialized technique adapted to the very simple situation in the Pauli algebra. More important,\nWigner was concerned with the problem of representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group,\nwhereas we consider the much simpler problem of the group structure itself, mainly in view of\napplication to the electromagnetic theory.\nThe intuitive meaning of the exceptional transformations is best recognized from the polar form of\nthe generating matrix. This can be carried out by direct application of the method discussed at the\nend of the last section. It is more instructive, however, to express the solution in terms of (circular\nand hyperbolic) trigonometry.\nWe ask for the conditions the polar factors have to satisfy in order that the relation\n1 + ˆa · σ = H(ˆ μ\n2)U(ˆ φ\n2)\n~\nh,\nu,\n(3.4.119)\nshould hold with μ =6\n0, φ =6\n0. Since all matrices are unimodular, it is sufficient to consider the\nequality of the traces:\nμ\nφ\nμ\nφ ) ˆ\n2 T rA = cosh(2) cos( 2) - i sinh(2 ) sin( 2 h · uˆ = 1\n(3.4.120)\nThis condition is satisfied if and only if\nhˆ uˆ = 0\n(3.4.121)\n·\n23[Wig39]; See also [Syn65], particularly for the connections with the electromagnetic field treated in our Section 4.\n[Pae69], p. 114, This author speaks of \"α-transformations.\"\n\nand\ncosh(μ) cos( φ ) = 1\n(3.4.122)\nThe axes of circular and hyperbolic rotation are thus perpendicular, to each other and the angles\nof these rotations are related in a unique fashion: half of the circular angle is the so-called Guder\nmannian function of half of the hyperbolic angle\nφ = gd\nμ\n(3.4.123)\nHowever, if μ and φ are infinitesimal, we get\n\nφ2\nμ\n1 +\n+ . . .\n1 +\n+ . . .\n=\n1, i.e.,\n(3.4.124)\n2 - φ2 =\n(3.4.125)\nμ\nWe note finally that products of exceptional matrices need not be exceptional, hence exceptional\nLorentz transformations do not form a group.\nIn spite of their special character, the exceptional matrices have interesting physical applications,\nboth in connection with the electromagnetic field as discussed in Section 4, and also for the con\nstruction of representations of the inhomogeous Lorentz group [Pae69, Wig39].\nWe conclude by noting that the canonical forms of Table 3.2 lend themselves to express the powers\nin simple form.\nAk\nFor the axial singular matrix we have\nA 2\n0 = A\n(3.4.126)\nThese projection matrices are called idempotent. The nonaxial singular matrices are nilpotent:\nA 2\n0 = 0\n(3.4.127)\nThe exceptional matrices (unimodular nonaxial) are raised to any power k (even non-real) by the\nformula\nAk = 1k (1 + k~a · ~σ)\n(3.4.128)\n= 1k exp (k~a · ~σ)\n(3.4.129)\nFor integer k, the factor 1k becomes unity.

      "content": "4 Pauli Algebra and Electrodynamics\n4.1 Lorentz transformation and Lorentz force\nThe main importance of the Pauli algebra is to provide us with a stepping stone for the theory of\nspinor spaces to which we turn in Section 5. Yet it is useful to stop at this point to show that the\nformalism already developed provides us with an efficient framework for limited, yet important\naspects of classical electrodyanmics (CED).\nWe have seen on page 26 that the effect on electric field on a test charge, a \"boost,\" can be con\nsidered as an active Lorentz transformation, whereby the field is proportional to the \"hyperbolic\nangular velocity μ .\"\nThis is in close analogy with the well known relation between the magnetic field and the cyclotron\nfrequency, i.e., a \"circular angular velocity\" φ . These results had been obtained under very special\nconditions. The Pauli algebra is well suited to state them in much greater generality.\nThe close connection between the algebra of the Lorentz group and that of the electromagnetic\nfield, is well known 24. However, instead of developing the two algebras separately and noting the\nisomorphism of the results, we utilize the mathematical properties of the Lorentz group developed\nin Section 3 and translate them into the language of electrodynamics. The definition of the elec\ntromagnetic field implied by this procedure is, of course, hypothetical, and we turn to experience\nto ascertain its scope and limits. The proper understanding of the limitation of this conception is\nparticularly important, as it serves to identify the direction for the deepening of the theory. The\nstandard operational definition of the electromagnetic field involves the use of a test charge. Ac\ncordingly we assume the existence of particles that can act in such a capacity. The particle is to\ncarry a charge e, a constant rest mass m, and the effect of the field acting during the time dt is\nto manifest itself in a change of the 4-momentum only, without involving any change in internal\nstructure 25.\nThis means that the field has a sufficiently low frequency in the rest frame of the particle so as\nnot to affect its internal structure. This is in harmony with the temporary exclusion of radiative\ninteraction stated already.\nLet the test charge be exposed to an electromagnetic field during a small time dt. We propose\nto describe the resulting change of the four-momentum P\nP 0 = P + dP as an infinitesimal\n→\nLorentz transformation. In this preliminary form the statement would seem to be trivial, since it\n24See [Syn35, Syn65] pp 87 & 343.\n25This assumption suggests the drawing of a line between two kinds of electromagnetic interactions: (i) the Lorentz\nforce; (ii) radiative interaction. We start with case (i), continue in Section 4.2 with the free field, but postpone the\ndiscussion of radiative interaction which affects the intrinsic structure and the rest mass of the particle. This subdivision\nof the interaction problem is not in the spirit of the classical theory. But then the classical radiation theory \"breaks\ndown\" on the atomic level. Conforming to our program stated in Section 3.1 we do not wish to stretch theories beyond\ntheir empirical validity, and postpone the discussion of radiative interaction until we shall be ready to deal with it in\nthe framework of quantum theory.\n\nis valid for any force that does not affect the intrinsic structure, say a combination of gravitational\nand frictional forces. In order to characterize specifically the Lorentz force, we have to add that the\ncharacterization of the field is independent of the fourmomentum of the test charge, moreover it is\nindependent of the frame of reference of the observer. These conditions can be expressed formally\nin the following.\nPostulate 1. The effect of the Lorentz force on a particle (test charge) is represented as the trans\nformation of the four-momentum space of the particle unto itself, and the transformations are el\nements of the active Lorentz group. Moreover, matrix representations in different Lorentz frames\nare connected by similarity transformations. (See Section 3.4.4.)\nWe now proceed to show that this postulate implies the known properties of the Lorentz force.\nFirst, we show that an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation indeed reduces to the Lorentz force\nprovided we establish a \"dictionary\" between the parameters of the transformation and the electro\nmagnetic field (see below Equation 4.1.12). Consider a pure Lorentz transformation along hˆ\np0 = p cosh μ + p0 sinh μ\n(4.1.1)\np0\n0 = p sinh μ + p0 cosh μ\n(4.1.2)\nwhere p~ = phˆ + p~ with ~p ~h = 0. For infinitesimal transformations μ\ndμ:\n·\n→\np0 - p = p0dμ\n(4.1.3)\np0\n0 - p0 = pdμ\n(4.1.4)\nor\n~p\n= p0μ ˆh\n(4.1.5)\np 0 = ~p hˆμ\n(4.1.6)\n·\nBy making use of\np~ = mc sinh μ = γm~v\n(4.1.7)\np0 = mc cosh μ = γmc\nwe obtain\n~p\n= pmchˆμ\n(4.1.8)\np 0 = pm~v hˆμ\nc ·\nTurning to rotation we have from Equation A.3.8 of Appendix A (See note on page 51 ).\n~\n= ~⊥ cos φ + ˆ\np⊥ sin φ\np0\np\nu × ~\n(4.1.9)\n⊥\n\n~\nFor an infinitesimal rotation φ ' dφ, and by using Equation 4.1.7 we obtain, since ~p0\nk = p~k and\np~k × uˆ = 0,\np~0 - p~ = -~\nu dφ = -γm~\nu dφ\n(4.1.10)\np × ˆ\nv × ˆ\nor,\n~p\n= -γm~\nu dφ\n(4.1.11)\nv × ˆ\nWith the definitions of 3.3.28 and 3.3.29 of page 26 written vectorially:\nγmc\nE~\n=\nμ hˆ\ne\nB~\n= -γmc φ uˆ\n(4.1.12)\ne\nEquations 4.1.8 and 4.1.9 reduce to the Lorentz force equations.\nLet us consider now an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation generated by\nV\n= 1 + μhˆ ~σ - iφuˆ ~σ\n(4.1.13)\n2 ·\n·\n= 1 + edt\nE + iB~\n~σ\n(4.1.14)\n2γmc\n·\nedt\n= 1 +\nF\n(4.1.15)\n2γmc\nwith\nf~ = ~\nB,\nF = f\nσ\nE + i ~\n~ ~\n(4.1.16)\n·\nIt is apparent from Equations 4.1.15 and 4.1.16 that the transformation properties of V and F are\nidentical. Since the transformation of V has been obtained already in Section 3.4.4, we can write\ndown at once that of the field f~.\nLet us express the passive Lorentz transformation of the four-momentum P from the inertial frame\nΣ to Σ0 as\nP 0 = SP S+\n(4.1.17)\nwhere S is unimodular. The field matrix transforms by a similarity transformation:\nF 0 = SF S-1\n(4.1.18)\nwith the complex reflections (contragradient entities) transforming as\nP 0 = S P S -1\n(4.1.19)\nF 0 = S F S +\n(4.1.20)\nFor\nS = H = exp(-μhˆ ~σ)\n(4.1.21)\n2 ·\n\nwe obtain the passive Lorentz transformation for a frame Σ2 moving with respect to Σ1, with-the\nvelocity\n~v = chˆ tanh μ\n(4.1.22)\nF 0 = HFH-1\n(4.1.23)\nWe extract from here the standard expressions by using the familiar decomposition\nf~ = f~k + f~⊥ = ( f~ hˆ)hˆ\n(4.1.24)\n·\nwe get\nf~0\n= f~\n(4.1.25)\nk\nk\n\nf~\n~σ = H\nf~\n~σ H-1 = H2 f~\n~σ\n(4.1.26)\n⊥ ·\n\n⊥ ·\n\n⊥ ·\n=\ncosh μ - sinh μhˆ · ~σ f~⊥ · ~σ\n(4.1.27)\nHence\nf~⊥\n= f~⊥ cosh μ + i sinh μ hˆ × f~⊥\n(4.1.28)\n= cosh μ f~⊥ + i tanh μ hˆ × f~⊥\n(4.1.29)\n~v\n= γ f~⊥ + ic × f~⊥\n(4.1.30)\nwhere we used Equation 4.1.22. Inserting from Equation 4.1.16 we get\nE~ 0\n= γ E~\n~v\nB~\n⊥\n⊥ + c ×\n⊥\nB~ 0\n= γ B~\n~v\nE~\n(4.1.31)\n⊥\n⊥ - c ×\n⊥\nE~k\n0 = E~k,\nB~k\n0 = B~k\nIt is interesting to compare the two compact forms 4.1.18 and 4.1.31. Whereas the latter may be\nthe most convenient for solving specific problems, the former will be the best stepping stone for\nthe deepening of the theory. The only Lorentz invariant of the field is the determinant, which we\nwrite for convenience with the negative sign:\nf~2\nE~ 2\n~\n2 2Ψ\n-|F | = 2\n1 T rF 2 =\n=\n- B~ 2 + 2iE~ · B = g e\n(4.1.32)\nHence we obtain the well know invariants\nI1 = E~ 2 - B~ 2 = g 2 cos 2ψ\n(4.1.33)\nI2 =\n2E~\nB~ = g 2 sin 2ψ\n·\nWe distinguish two cases\n\n1. f~2 = 0\n2. f~2 = 0\nThese cases can be associated with the similarity classes of Table 3.2. In the case (i) F is uni\nmodular axial, for (ii) it is nonaxial singular. (Since F is traceless, the two other entries in the\ntable do not apply.) We first dispose of case (ii). A field having this Lorentz invariant property is\ncalled a null-field. The F matrix generates an exceptional Lorentz transformation (Section 3.4.4).\nIn this field configuration E~ and B~ are perpendicular and are of equal size. This is a relativistically\ninvariant property that is characteriestic of plane waves to be discussed in Section 4.2.\nIn the \"normal\" case (i) it is possible to find a canonical Lorentz frame, in which the electric and\nthe magnetic fields are along the same line, they are parallel, or antiparallel. The Lorentz screw\ncorresponds to a Maxwell wrench26. It is specified by a unit vector ˆsn and the values of the fields\nin the canonical frame Ecan and Bcan . The wrench may degenerate can can with Ecan = 0, or\nBcan = 0. The canonical frame is not unique, since a Lorentz transformation along nˆ leaves the\ncanonical fields invariant.\nWe can evaluate the invariant eqn:iii-8-18ab in the canonical frame and obtain\nE2\ncan - B2\n= I1 = g 2 cos 2ψ\n(4.1.34)\ncan\n2EcanBcan = I2 = g 2 sin 2ψ\n(4.1.35)\nOne obtains from here\nEcan = g cos ψ\n(4.1.36)\nBcan = g sin ψ\n(4.1.37)\nThe invariant character of the field is determined by the ratio\nBcan = tan ψ\n(4.1.38)\nEcan\nthat has been called its pitch by Synge (op. cit. p. 333) who discussed the problem of canonical\nframes of the electromagnetic field with the standard tensorial method.\nThe definition of pitch in problem #8 is the reciprocal to the one here given and should be changed\nto agree with Eq. (20)\nNOTE: Eq. (18) of Appendix A is incorrect. Eq. (6) is identical\nto the unnumbered equation preceding (18).\n26See Synge, as quoted on page 47.\n\n4.2 The Free Maxwell Field\nOur apporach to CED thus far is unusual inasmuch as we have effectively defined, classifed and\ntransformed the electromagnetic field at a small region of space-time without having used the\nMaxwell equations. This is, of course, an indication of the effectiveness of our definition of the\nfield in terms of active Lorentz transformations.\nIn order to arrive at the Maxwell equations we invoke the standard principle of relativistic invari\nance, involving the passive interpretation of the Lorentz group.\nPostulate 2. The electromagnetic field satisfies a first order differential equation in the space-time\ncoordinates that is covariant under Lorentz transformations.\nWe consider the four-dimensional del operator {∂0, r} with ∂0 = ∂/∂(ct) = ∂/∂r0 as a four-\nvector, with its matrix equivalent\nD = ∂0 -r · ~σ\n(4.2.1)\nThe rationale for the minus sign is as follows. Let D operate on a function representing a plane\nwave:\nψ = exp -i(ωt - ~k ~r) = exp -i(k0r0 - ~k ~r)\n(4.2.2)\n·\n·\nwe have\n\niDψ = k01 + ~k ~σ ψ = Kψ\n(4.2.3)\n·\nThus D has the same transformation properties as K:\nD0 = SDS+\n(4.2.4)\nwhile the complex reflection\nD = ∂01 + r · ~σ\n(4.2.5)\ntransforms as K , i.e.\n\nS\nD0 = DS-1\n(4.2.6)\n\nBy using the transformation rules 4.1.18, 4.1.20 of the last section we see that DF transforms as a\nfour-vector J:\n\nS\nS\nDS-1\nSF S-1 = JS-1\n(4.2.7)\nThus\n\nDF = J\n(4.2.8)\nis a differential equation satisfying the conditions of Postulate 2. Setting tentatively\n~j\nJ = ρ1 +\n~σ\n(4.2.9)\nc ·\n\nn\no\nn\no\n\nwith ρ,~j the densities of charge and current, 4.2.8 is indeed a compact form of the Maxwell equa\ntions.\nThis is easily verified by sorting out the terms with the factors (1, σk) and by separating the real\nand imaginary parts.\nBy operating on the Equation 4.2.9 with D and taking the trace we obtain\nDDF\n\n= (∂0\n2 -r2)F = DJ\n(4.2.10)\nand\nT rD J = ∂0ρ + ~\nj = 0\n(4.2.11)\nc r · ~\nThese are standard results which are easily provided by the formalism. However, we do not have\nan explicit expression for J that would be satisfactory for a theory of radiative interaction.\nTherefore, in accordance with our program stated in Section 4.1 we set J = 0 and examine only\nthe free field that obeys the homogeneous equations\nDF =\n(4.2.12)\n∂2\n2 F =\n0 -r\nThe simplest elementary solution of 4.2.12 are monochromatic plane waves from which more\ncomplicated solutions can be built up. Hence we consider\nF (~r, t) = F+(~k, ω) exp i(ωt - ~k ~r)\n+ F-(~k, ω) exp i(ωt - ~k ~r)\n(4.2.13)\n·\n·\nwhere F\nare matrices independent of space-time. Inserting into Equation 4.2.12 yields the condi\n±\ntion\nω2 - c 2k2 = 0\n(4.2.14)\nIntroducing the notation\nθ = k0r0 - ~k ~r\n(4.2.15)\n·\nwe write Equation 4.2.13 as\nF (~r, t) = F+ exp(-iθ) + F- exp(iθ)\n(4.2.16)\nInserting into 4.2.12 we have\nKF± = K E~± + iB~± · ~σ = 0\n(4.2.17)\n\nFrom here we get explicitly\n~k\nE~± + iB~± = 0\n(4.2.18)\n·\n~\n= iˆ\n~\nE± + iB~±\nkx E± + iB~±\n(4.2.19)\nand we infer the well known properties of plane waves: E~ and B~ are of equal magnitude, and\n~ B, ~\nE, ~ k from a right-handed Cartesian triad. We note that this constellation corresponds to the\nfield of the type (ii) with f~2 = 0 mentioned on page 51.\nSince the classical E~, B~ are real, we have also the relations\nE~\n= ~+,\nB~\n= ~+\n(4.2.20)\nE∗\nB∗\n-\n-\nConsider now the case in which\nf~- = E~- + iB~- = 0\n(4.2.21)\nwhich, in view of 4.2.20 implies\nE~+ = iB~+\n(4.2.22)\nThus at a fixed point and direction in space the electric field lags the magnetic field by a phase\nπ/2, and f~+ = (E~+ + iB~+) is the amplitude of a circularly polarized wave of positive helicity,\ni.e., the rotation of the electric and magnetic vectors and the wave vector ~k form a right screw\nor the linear and angular momentum point in the same direction +~k. In the traditional optical\nterminology this is called a left circularly polarized wave. However, following current practice, we\nshall refer to positive helicity as right polarization R. The negative helicity state is represented by\nf~- = ( E~- + iB~-).\nActually, we have the alternative of associating f~∗ = ( E~- - iB~-) with R and f~+\n∗ = ( E~+ - iB~+)\n-\nwith L. However, we prefer the first choice and will use the added freedom in the formalism to\ndescribe the absorption and the emission process at a later stage 27\nMeanwhile, we turn to the discussion of polarization which has a number of interesting aspects,\nparticularly if carried out in the context of spinor algebra.\n27In the literature the Fourier decomposition of the field is usually written in terms of the vector potential rather\nthan in terms of E~ + iB~. The latter method, which alone leads naturally to a decomposition into helicity states, is\nconsidered by [Kra58], see page 86."
