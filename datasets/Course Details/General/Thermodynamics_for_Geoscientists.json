      "content": "12.480 Problem Set #1\n\n1.) Calculate Gsoln for the sanidine - analbite solution at 2 kbar, 600oC. Use the\nbinary asymmetric solution model of Thompson and Waldbaum (1969).\n\nWG\nAb = 6326.7 + 0.0925P - 4.6321T\nWG\nOr = 7671.8 + 0.1121P - 3.8565T\n\nAnd plot Gsoln vs. XKA1Si3O8\n\nand give the compositions of the stable 2-phase assemblage. Note, that there are two\nways to obtain the composition of the coexisting phases; graphically and analytically.\nSince you have the G-curve plotted you may determine the compositions graphically, but\nsee below?\n\nNow repeat this exercise using the Margules parameters for low albite - maximum\nmicrocline reported in Whitney and Stormer (1977).\n\nWG\nAb = 7973.1 + 0.11P - 6.48T\nWG\nOr = 7490.9 + 0.11P - 2.17T\n\nThe differences you see in the G-X curves are the result of differences between the\nsolution properties of feldspar frameworks with distinct A1/(Al + Si) tetrahedral site\ndistributions.\nWhat is a technique you would use in modeling the thermodynamic properties of\nfeldspars that would allow you to account for the differences in solution behavior as a\nfunction of Al/(Al + Si) site occupancy differences? (Not a trick question. A sentence or\ntwo will do.)\n\n2.) Some special properties of a solution with a solvus are useful in defining the shape\nof the solvus. For example, the spinodal is the point on the G-curve where the curvature\nchanges from positive to negative or where ∂Gsoln\n2/∂X2\n2 = 0. Also, at the critical point\n∂Gsoln\n2/∂X2\n2 = 0 and ∂Gsoln\n3/∂X2\n3 = 0. Obtain an expression for ∂Gsoln\n2/∂X2\n2 and\n∂Gsoln\n3/∂X2\n3 for both a symmetric and asymmetric binary solution. Now use these\nexpressions for the symmetric solution to infer the deviation of a solution from ideal\nbehavior that would be necessary to produce critical unmixing. For example what values\nof W are necessary to generate a critical point at 800 oC? What value is necessary to\ngenerate a critical point at 400 oC.\n\n3) Among the expressions that you derived in 2) you should have one that gives you the\ncompositions of the spinode curves as a function of temperature. How would you solve\nfor the compositions of the equilibrium phases that coexist across the solvus at a given\n\ntemperature (these curves on a T - X diagram are referred to as the binodes)? In\nquestion 1) above you did this graphically. Write down the constraints that you would\nuse to solve for the compositions of the coexisting phases for a give set of W's in an\nasymmetric binary solution. Can you solve for the compositions of the coexisting phases\nanalytically? For extra credit, develop a program in your favorite language or math\nlibrary to solve for the binodes in an asymmetric solution."

(A) shows free-\nenergy curves gP bca and gC2/c for the strain-free phases, and φC2/c for the strained phases, at\ntemperature T . The compositions of the two coexisting pairs of strain-free phases indicated by the\ncommon tangents (labeled strain-free), are \"Opx\" and \"Aug (strain-free),\" and \"Pig (strain-free)\" and\n\"Aug (strain-free).\" The compositions of the coexisting pair of coherent phases, indicated by the\ncommon tangent (labeled coherent), are given by the position of \"Pig\" and \"Aug.\" (B) shows a free-\nenergy curve for C2/c phases strained by coherency. (C) shows the pseudobinary phase diagram.\nThe coherent spinodal and chemical spinodal are curves defined by the loci of the inflection points\n(s), on the free-energy curves φC2/c and gC2/c, respectively, as a function of temperature. The\ncoherent solvus and strain-free solvus are curves defined by the loci of the common-tangent points\nof free-energy curves φC2/c and gC2/c, respectively. The orthopyroxene-augite strain-free solvus\n(outermost curves) is defined by the common-tangent points on free-energy curves gP bca and gC2/c."
