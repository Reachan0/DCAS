The prerequisites are high school algebra and trigonometry. Prior experience with calculus is helpful but not essential.\n\nCourse Overview\n\nCalculus is a foundational course at MIT; it plays an important role in the understanding of science, engineering, economics, and computer science, among other disciplines. This introductory calculus course covers differentiation and integration of functions of one variable, with applications. Topics include:\n\nConcepts of Function, Limits and Continuity\n\nDifferentiation Rules, Application to Graphing, Rates, Approximations, and Extremum Problems\n\nDefinite and Indefinite Integration\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n\nApplications to Geometry: Area, Volume, and Arc Length\n\nApplications to Science: Average Values, Work, and Probability\n\nTechniques of Integration\n\nApproximation of Definite Integrals, Improper Integrals, and L'Hospital's Rule\n\nCourse Goals\n\nAfter completing this course, students should have developed a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts of single variable calculus and a range of skills allowing them to work effectively with the concepts.\n\nThe basic concepts are:\n\n1. Derivatives as rates of change, computed as a limit of ratios\n\n2. Integrals as a \"sum,\" computed as a limit of Riemann sums\n\nAfter completing this course, students should demonstrate competency in the following skills:\n\nUse both the limit definition and rules of differentiation to differentiate functions.\n\nSketch the graph of a function using asymptotes, critical points, the derivative test for increasing/decreasing functions, and concavity.\n\nApply differentiation to solve applied max/min problems.\n\nApply differentiation to solve related rates problems.\n\nEvaluate integrals both by using Riemann sums and by using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nApply integration to compute arc lengths, volumes of revolution and surface areas of revolution.\n\nEvaluate integrals using advanced techniques of integration, such as inverse substitution, partial fractions and integration by parts.\n\nUse L'Hospital's rule to evaluate certain indefinite forms.\n\nDetermine convergence/divergence of improper integrals and evaluate convergent improper integrals.\n\nDetermine the convergence/divergence of an infinite series and find the Taylor series expansion of a function near a point.\n\nCourse Structure\n\nThis course, designed for independent study, has been organized to follow the sequence of topics covered in an MIT course on Single Variable Calculus. The content is organized into five major units:\n\nDifferentiation\n\nApplications of Differentiation\n\nThe Definite Integral and its Applications\n\nTechniques of Integration\n\nExploring the Infinite\n\nEach unit has been further divided into parts (A, B, C, etc.), with each part containing a sequence of sessions. Because each session builds on knowledge from previous sessions, it is important you progress through the sessions in order. Each session covers an amount you might expect to complete in one sitting.\n\nWithin each unit you will be presented with sets of problems at strategic points, so you can test your understanding of the material. As you begin each part of a unit, review the problem set at its end so that you may work toward solving those problems as you learn new material.\n\nMIT expects its students to spend about 150 hours on this course. More than half of that time is spent preparing for class and doing assignments. It's difficult to estimate how long it will take you to complete the course, but you can probably expect to spend an hour or more working through each individual session.\n\nLecture Video\n\nMost sessions include video clips from lectures of Professor David Jerison teaching 18.01, recorded live on the MIT campus in the fall of 2007. The video was carefully segmented by the developers of this OCW Scholar course to take you step-by-step through the content. The lecture video clips are accompanied by supporting course notes.\n\nRecitation Video\n\nThis OCW Scholar course includes dozens of Recitation Videos - brief problem solving sessions taught by an experienced MIT Recitation Instructor - developed and recorded especially for you, the independent learner. Meet the recitation instructors and learn more about how to benefit from this help by watching their introductory video.\n\nView video page\n\nDownload video\n\nDownload transcript\n\nReadings, Assignments and Exams\n\nNo textbook is required for this OCW Scholar course.\n\nThe notes that accompany the video clips present their content slightly more formally than Professor Jerison does. If you are wondering exactly what conditions must hold for a statement to be true or if you wish to see the details of the calculations displayed on the blackboard, check the notes.\n\n\"Worked examples\" present a problem or problems to be solved; many of these problems have appeared on homework assignments at MIT. After you have solved these problems you can check your answer against a detailed solution.\n\nSome worked examples will be accompanied by a Mathlet. These interactive learning tools will improve your geometric intuition and illustrate how changes in certain factors affect the results of different calculations.\n\nProblem sets occur at the end of each part; these were taken directly from homework assigned at MIT in the Fall of 2009. As you start each part, familiarize yourself with the problems in the problem set. This will enable you to work on each problem as you gain the knowledge you need to solve it. Once you have completed the problem set you can check your answers against the solutions provided. (The problem sets are carefully selected from a longer list of questions available to you. Do not hesitate to work any problem that piques your interest.)\n\nEach unit ends in an exam. To prepare for an exam, check that you are proficient in each of the topics listed in the exam review lecture and review your work on the unit's examples and problem sets. Allow yourself one hour to work each exam and three hours to complete the final. The exams are quite challenging; do not be surprised if you are unable to complete all of the questions correctly in the time allowed.\n\nTextbook\n\nThis OCW Scholar course is self-contained and no textbook is required. If you have access to a single variable calculus text it will probably serve as a useful companion to this course, although you might have to deal with slight differences in terminology and notation.\n\nTechnical Requirements\n\nThis course includes features that do not display correctly in Internet Explorer. For best results, we recommend viewing this course with\nFirefox\n,\nSafari\nor\nChrome\n.\n\n« [Previous](/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/pages/index.htm) |\nNext\n»",

      "content": "Exam 1 Review, Continued\nThe Definition of the Derivative\nThe main thing we talked about in the first part of the course was the definition\nof the derivative; one of our goals has been to understand its meaning. The\nformula for the derivative is:\nd f(x) = f 0(x) = lim f(x + Δx) - f(x)\ndx\nΔx\nΔx\n→\nThis is a central focus of this course and you want to be able to recognize this\nformula in a number of forms.\nHow might you be asked to use this on a test? Our chief use of this formula\noccurred while finding specific formulas for derivatives. In fact, we used it to\nfind many of the formulas you might be tested on:\nn\nx\nx , sin-1 x, tan-1 x, sin x, cos x, tan x, sec x, e , ln x.\nLet's briefly review which functions we used this on, and what other facts\nwe needed in finding our formulas. We used the definition of the derivative to\ncompute formulas for the derivatives of\n1/x, xn , sin x, cos x, a x , u v and u/v.\n·\nTo complete these calculations we needed to know the derivatives of sin x, cos x\nand ax at x = 0. To derive the product and quotient rules we needed to\nknow the slopes of the individual functions u and v. It wasn't the definition\nof the derivative alone that got us these formulas, but in each case it got us\nto something simpler that we could use to get our formulas. That \"getting to\nsomething simpler\" is the sort of thing you should be able to do on a test.\nBut don't sit down and memorize the derivations of all those formulas to\nprepare for the test. What you need to learn is how to use the definition of the\nderivative to derive a formula for any function -- there could be questions on\nex , x\n2 , or some other function.\nLimits\nThere are also some fundamental limits you should know about for the test.\nRecall that any equation can be read in two directions. In the case of the\ndefinition of the derivative, reading the equation backward tells us that if we\nknow the slope of the graph of a function you can find the value of a limit:\nlim f(x + Δx) - f(x) = f 0(x).\nΔx\nΔx\n→\nFor example, suppose you are asked to find:\nu\ne - 1\nlim\n.\nu\nu\n→\n\nIf you recognize that:\neu - 1\nd\nu\nlim\n=\ne\nu\nu\ndu\n→\nu=0\nthen it's easy to see that the answer is 1. The key is recognizing that\nu\ne - 1\nlim\nu\nu\n→\nmatches the formula\nf(x + Δx) - f(x)\nlim\nΔx\nΔx\n→\nwhen f(x) = ex, Δx = u, and x = 0.\nImplicit Differentiation (continued)\nFor the test, you also should be able to use implicit differentiation to derive\nformulas for derivatives of functions like sin-1 x and ln x. The power of implicit\ndifferentiation is that it lets you take a formula and simplify it as much as\npossible; you're not restricted to writing y as a function of x.\nFor instance, sin y = x is a much simpler equation than y = sin-1 x. This\nsecond formula is easy to differentiate implicitly:\n(cos y)y0 = 1\nso\ny0 =\n=\n.\ncos y\n√\n1 - x2\n(If you're not sure why cos(sin-1 x) =\n√\n1 - x2, draw a right triangle whose\n\"opposite\" edge has length x and whose hypotenuse has length 1.)\nTangent Lines\nGeometrically, a derivative is the slope of a tangent line to a graph. On the\ntest you may be asked to compute the equation of a tangent line, to graph the\nfunction y0 or to tell whether a function is differentiable by looking at its graph.\nThe first two types of questions are fairly straightforward, and we really only\nhave one way to answer the third type of question. If a graph is differentiable,\nit must be possible to draw a line tangent to every point on the graph. This\nmeans that the limit of the secant lines must be well defined at every point on\nthe graph. And this, in turn, means that the secant lines must have the same\nlimits as they approach the tangent from the left and from the right.\nOne way to practice for the test is to graph a function like y = ln x and\nthen try to draw the graph of y0. To do this, first draw a few tangent lines to\nthe graph. Observe what you can about them - are their slopes all positive?\nAll increasing? All the same? Do any tangent lines have slope zero? How\nsteep is the steepest tangent line, or is there no steepest line? Then use that\n\ninformation to graph a curve whose height above the x-axis (approximately)\nequals the slopes of the tangents to the original graph.\nDo not expect the graph of the derivative to look like the graph of the\nfunction. If possible, check your work by taking the derivative of the function\nwhose graph you looked at.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.01SC Single Variable Calculus\n\nFall 2010\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

(2a) The line tangent to y = 3x2 -5x + 2 at x = 2 has a slope equal\nto that of the curve at x = 2 and passes through the point (2, 4).\nThe slope of the line at x = 2 is y′(x = 2) = 6x -5 = 6(2) -5 = 7 = m.\nThe y-intercept of the line, b, is found by using the slope and the known\npoint:\n-b = 7\n2 -0\n⇒b = -10.\nThe equation of the line is therefore\ny = mx + b = 7x -10.\n(2b) If the curve had a horizontal tangent, then at some point the first\nderivative of y with respect to x would be equal to zero.\nThe derivative of the equation xy3 + x3y = 4 is\n\ny3 + x(3y2)y′ + 3x2y + y′x3 = 0 ⇒y′(x3y2 + x3) = -y3 -3x2y.\nIf y′ were\nto 0, then -y\nequal\n-3x2y = 0\nx3y2 + x3\n⇒-y3 -3x2y = 0. This\nequation is valid when both x and y are zero or when y3 = -3x2y for nonzero\nx and y.\nThe first case is not valid, because we are given that xy3 +x3y = 4, which\nwould not be possible if x and y were both zero.\nThe second case is also impossible, because y3 = -3x2y ⇒y2 = -3x2 (we\ncan divide by y because in this case it must be nonzero) and it is not possible\nfor the ratio of two squares (necessarily positive numbers) to be equal to a\nnegative number.\nTherefore y′ can never be zero and so the curve defined by xy3 + x3y = 4\nhas no horizontal tangents.\n3.

As shown in the graph below, y =\nhas the following properties:\nx2 + 1\n- Local maximum (y′ = 0, y′′ < 0) at x=1\n- Local minimum (y′ = 0, y′′ > 0) at x=-1\n- The function is increasing (y′ > 0) when |x| < 1\n- The function is decreasing (y′ < 0) when |x| > 1\nThe inflection points (y′′ = 0) are x = 0,\n√\n-\n±\n- The graph is symmetric about the origin\n- The horizontal asymptote\n\nx\nlim\n\nis the line y = 0\nx→infx + 1\n- There is no vertical asymptote\n5. The values x and y are defined as in the figure below:\n\nThe area of printed type = 50 in2, so xy = 50 and the total area of the\nposter is (x + 4)(y + 8). To minimize the amount of paper used, we need to\nminimize the total area of the poster.\n(x + 4)(y + 8) = xy + 4y + 8x + 32 = 82 + 4y + 8x\nsince we know that xy = 50.\nWe can also substitute y = 50/x, so that we have an area equal to:\n4(50)\n82 +\n+ 8x.\nx\nTo find the minimum of this equation we set the first derivative with\nrespect to x equal to zero:\n-\n+ 8 = 0\nx2 = 25\nx = 5,\nx2\n⇒\n⇒\ntaking only the positive root because x represents a physical quantity.\nWe can check that x = 5 corresponds to a minimum of the area by taking\nthe second derivative of -200\n2 +8, which is 400\n3 . Since this is positive at x = 5,\nx\nx\nthe point does indeed correspond to a minimum.\nIf x = 5 then xy = 50 ⇒y = 10. Thus the dimensions of the poster which\nminimize the amount of paper used are a = x + 4 = 9 in and b = y + 8 = 18\nin.\n6. Let y be the total distance from the plane to the car, and let x be\nthe horizontal distance between the plane and the car. The question asks for\ndc/dt, the car's speed.\n\nFrom the Pythagorean theorem, y =\nx2 + 1, because the plane is a\ndistance one mile above the road. By definition, we also know that dc/dt =\ndx/dt -120, as the plane has speed 120 mph with respect to the ground. In\n√\naddition, since y = 3/2 at t = 0, we know that x =\np\ny2 -1 =\n5 at t = 0.\nWe can then determine that:\ndy\n=\n(x2 + 1)-1/2\ndx\n(2x)\n=\ndt\n\ndt\n\n-\nand we can substitute x =\n√\n5/2 to obtain:\ndx =\ndt\n-136\n√\n\n≈-2.2\nFrom this we can calculate:\ndc/dt = 2.2 -120 ≈65.5 mph\n√\n\n7.

Let y(x) = e . Using the two-trapezoid method, the picture should\nx\nbe approximately as follows:\n\nThe areas of the regions are then:\nRegion I: (3 -1)y(1) = 2y(1) = 2(2.7) = 5.4\nRegion II: (5 -3)y(3) = 2y(3) = 2(6.7) = 13.4\nRegion III: (.5)(3 -1)(y(3) -y(1)) = y(3) -y(1) = 6.7 -2.7 = 4\nRegion IV:(.5)(5 -3)(y(5) -y(3)) = y(5) -y(3) = 29.7 -6.7 = 23\nAnd the total area is then 45.8 units2.\n12.\n(12a) It is given that the rate of radioactive decay of a mass of\nRadium-226, dm/dt, is proportional to the amount m of Radium present at\ntime t.

We can find A and C by using the information\ngiven in the problem.\nFirst, we know that there are 100 mg of Radium\npresent at t = 0, so that\nm(t = 0) = C = 100 mg.\nWe also know that it takes 1600 years for m to decrease by half. Therefore:\n(50/100) = .5 = e1600A\nln(.5) = 1600A\nA = ln(.5)/1600.\nFinally,\nm = CeAt\n= 100e(ln(.5)/1600)t\n= 100(eln(.5))t/1600\n= 100(.5)t/1600,\nwhere t is in years and m(t) is in mg.\n(12b) When t = 1000 years, and using the approximation given in the\nquestion,\nm = 100(.5)1000/1600\n= 100(2)-10/16\n≈100(.65)\n= 65mg.\n13. The formula for arc length S of a curve defined by parametric equa-\ntions x(t) and y(t) is:\nS =\nZ b p\nx′(t)2 + y′(t)2dt.\na\nIn this problem, x(t) is given as\nZ t\ncos(πu2/2)du\n\nand\nt\ny(t) =\nsin(πu2/2)du.\nTheir derivatives are\nZ\nx′(t) = cos\nπt2\ny′(t) = sin\nπt2\n\nSubstituting x′(t), y′(t), and the appropriate limits into the formula for\narc length results in:\nS =\nZ t0 q\ncos2(πt2/2) + sin2(πt2/2)dt\n=\nZ t0\ndt\nt0\n= t\n\n= t0\n14.

      "content": "Product of Linear Approximations\nSuppose we have two complicated functions and we need an estimate of the value\nof their product. We could multiply the functions out and then approximate\nthe result, or we could approximate each function separately and then find the\nproduct of the two (simple) approximations. Does it matter which we do? Not\nvery much.\nProve that the linear approximation of f(x) · g(x) equals the (linear part of\nthe) product of the linear approximations of f(x) and g(x).\nSolution\nLet f(x) and g(x) be two functions of x that are defined and differentiable near\nsome value x0. We know that:\nf(x) ≈f(x0) + f ′(x0)(x -x0)\nand\ng(x) ≈g(x0) + g′(x0)(x -x0).\nThe product of these two linear approximations is:\n(f(x0) + f ′(x0)(x -x0)) · (g(x0) + g′(x0)(x -x0))\n= f(x0)g(x0)+f ′(x0)(x-x0)g(x0)+f(x0)g′(x0)(x-x0)+f ′(x0)g′(x0)(x-x0)2\n= f(x0)g(x0) + (f ′(x0)g(x0) + f(x0)g′(x0))(x -x0) + f ′(x0)g′(x0)(x -x0)2.\nOn the other hand, the linear approximation of the product (f · g)(x) is:\n(f · g)(x0) + (f · g)′(x0) · (x -x0)\n= f(x0)g(x0) + (f ′(xo)g(x0) + g′(x0)f(x0))(x -x0)\nThe difference between the two approximations is f ′(x0)g′(x0)(x -x0)2,\nwhich is a negligible amount when x is sufficiently close to x0. For example, if\nx -x0 = 0.01 then (x -x0)2 = 0.0001"

      "content": "Mean Value Theorem: Consequences\nThe first thing we apply the MVT to is graphing, but we'll see later that this\nis significant in all the rest of calculus.\n- If f 0 > 0 then f is increasing.\n- If f 0 < 0 then f is decreasing.\n- If f 0 = 0 then f is constant.\nWe told you that the first of these two are true, but we didn't prove them.\nWe can now prove them using the MVT.\nProof: The mean value theorem tells us that:\nf(b) - f(a) = f 0(c)\nb - a\nfor some c between a and b. For the purposes of this proof we'll assume that\nb > a. We write the equation for the MVT \"backwards\" because we want to\nuse information about f 0 to get information about f.\nWe manipulate the equation to get:\nf(b) - f(a)\n= f 0(c)(b - a)\nf(b)\n= f(a) + f 0(c)(b - a)\nThis new form of the MVT will let us check these three facts.\nSince a < b, b - a > 0 and the sign of f 0(c)(b - a) is completely determined\nby the sign of f 0(c)(b - a).\n- If f 0(c) > 0 then f(b) > f(a).\n- If f 0(c) < 0 then f(b) < f(a).\n- If f 0(c) = 0 then f(b) = f(a).\nThese facts may seem obvious, but they are not. The definition of the\nderivative is written in terms of infinitesimals. It's not a sure thing that these\ninfinitesimals have anything to do with the large scale behavior of the function.\nBefore, we were saying that the difference quotient was approximately equal\nto the derivative. Now we're saying that it's exactly equal to a derivative.\n(Although we don't know at what point that derivative should be taken.)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.01SC Single Variable Calculus\n\nFall 2010\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

In general, power series of even\nfunctions will have only even degree terms and power series of odd functions\nwill consist of all odd degree terms.\nQuestion: Why is the radius of convergence the smaller of the two radii?\nAnswer: If |x| is larger than the smallest radius of convergence then one\nof your functions isn't defined at x, so you can't expect multiplication by that\nfunction to make sense.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.01SC Single Variable Calculus\n\nFall 2010\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The human ear's pain threshold is about\n120 decibels.\na) Suppose that a jet engine at 50 meters has a decibel level of 130, and a\nnormal conversation at 1 meter has a decibel level of 60.

Based on this rule, calculate the decibel level of\nthe sound from the jet at a distance of 100 meters, at distance of 1 km.1\n1The inverse square law is justified by the fact that the intensity is measured in energy per\nunit time per unit area. When the sound has travelled a distance r, the energy of a sound spread\nover a sphere of radius r centered at the source. The area of that sphere is proportional to r2, so\nthe average intensity is proportional to 1/r2 . Fortunately for people who live near airports, sound\n\n1.

This is\nsimple interest.\nFor compound interest, the year is divided into k equal time periods and the\ninterest is calculated and added to the account at the end of each period. So at\nthe end of the first period, A = P (1 + r( k\n1 )); this is the new amount for the second\nperiod, at the end of which A = P (1 + r( k\n1 ))(1 + r( k\n1 )), and continuing this way, at\nthe end of the year the amount is\n\nr k\nA = P 1 +\n.\nk\nThe compound interest rate r thus earns the same in a year as the simple interest\nrate of\n\nr k\n1 +\n- 1 ;\nk\nthis equivalent simple interest rate is in bank jargon the \"annual percentage rate\"\nor APR.3\na) Compute the APR of 5% compounded monthly, daily,4 and continuously.\nContinuous compounding means the limit as k tends to infinity.\nb) As in part (a), compute the APR of 10% compounded monthly, biweekly\n(k=26), daily, and continuously. (We have thrown in the biweekly rate because\nloans can be paid off biweekly.)\n3Banks are required to reveal this so-called APR when they offer loans. The APR also takes\ninto account certain bank fees known as points. Unfortunately, not all fees are included in it, and\nthe true costs are higher if the loan is paid off early.\n4For daily compounding assume that the year has 365 days, not 365.25. Banks are quite careful\nabout these subtle differences. If you look at official tables of rates from precalculator days you\nwill find that they are off by small amounts because U.S. regulations permitted banks to pretend\nthat a year has 360 days.\n\np\nr\n1.

Applications of Differentiation\nb) No inflection points. y00 = 3x2, so the function is convex. x = 0 is not a\npoint of inflection because y00 > 0 on both sides of x = 0.\nc) Inflection point at x = 0. (y00 = -2x/(1 + x2)2)\nd) No inflection points. Reasoning: y00 = 2/(x - 1)3 . Thus y00 > 0 and the\nfunction is concave up when x > 1, and y00 < 0 and the function is concave down\nwhen x < 1. But x = 1 is not called an inflection point because the function is not\ncontinuous there. In fact, x = 1 is a singular point.\ne) No inflection points. y00 = -8/(x+1)3 .

The roots of the quadratic polynomial are distinct real\nnumbers if the discriminant is positive. (The discriminant is defined as the number\nunder the square root in the quadratic formula.) Therefore there are distinct real\nroots if and only if\n(2a)2 - 4(3)b > 0,\nor\na 2 - 3b > 0.\nFrom the picture, since y →inf as x →inf and y → -inf as x → -inf, the larger\nroot of 3x2 + 2ax + b = 0 (with the plus sign in the quadratic formula) must be the\nlocal min, and the smaller root must be the local max.\nSince y <<-1 when x << -1\nand y >> 1 when x >> 1, the\nlocal max. is to the left of the local min.\n\n2. Applications of Differentiation\nE. Solutions to 18.01 Exercises\nb) y00 = 6x + 2a, so the inflection point is at -a/3. Therefore the condition\ny0 < 0 at the inflection point is\ny0(-a/3) = 3(-a/3)2 + 2a(-a/3) + b = -a 2/3 + b < 0,\nwhich is the same as\na 2 - 3b > 0.\nIf y0 < 0 at some point x0, then the function is decreasing at that point. But\ny →inf as x →inf, so there must be a local minimum at a point x > x0. Similarly,\nsince y → -inf as x → -inf, there must be a local maximum at a point x < x0.\nComment: We evaluate y0 at the inflection point of y (x = -a/3) since we are\ntrying to decide (cf. part (b)) whether y0 is ever negative. To do this, we find the\nminimum of y0 (which occurs where y00 = 0).\n2B-4\nMax is at x = 5 or x = 10;\nMin is at x = 0 or x = 8.\n2B-5\n-7\n-3\n-1\nGraph of function\nGraph of derivative; note that\nlocal maximum point above corresponds\npoint of inflection above corresponds to\nlocal minimum below.\nto zero below;\n2B-6 a) Try y0 = (x + 1)(x - 1) = x2 - 1.

Taking the derivative with respect to\nt, the critical points satisfy\nx\ny\nz\n2xx0 + 2yy0 = 0\nThis equation says\n2((60 + 60t)60 + (50t)50) = 0 = ⇒ (602 + 502)t = -602\nHence\nt = -36/61 ≈-35min\nThe ships were closest at around 11 : 25 am.\n2E-9 dy/dt = 2(x - 1)dx/dt. Notice that in the range x < 1, x - 1 is negative and\nso (x - 1) = -√y. Therefore,\ndx/dt = (1/2(x - 1))(dy/dt) = -(1/2√y)(dy/dt) = +(√y)(1 - y)/2 = 1/4\n√\nMethod 2: Doing this directly turns out to be faster:\nx = 1 -√y = ⇒ dx/dt = 1 - (1/2)y-1/2dy/dt\nand the rest is as before.\n2E-10 r = Ct1/2 . The implicit assumption is that the volume of oil is constant:\nπr2T = V or r 2T = (V/π) = const\nTherefore, differentiating with respect to time t,\n(r 2T )0 = 2rr0T + r 2T 0 = 0 = ⇒ T 0 = -2r0/r\nBut r0 = (1/2)Ct-1/2, so that r0/r = 1/2t. Therefore\nT 0 = -1/t\n(Although we only know the rate of change of r up to a constant of proportionality,\nwe can compute the absolute rate of change of T .)\n\nE. Solutions to 18.01 Exercises\n2.

The sign does not change across the singular\npoint x = 0 because the power in the denominator is even.\n(continued\n)\n→\ny00 = 2 + 2x-3 = 2(x3\nx3\n+ 1)\nTherefore y00 = 0 implies x3 = -1, or x = -1. Keeping track of the sign change\nin the denominator as well as the numerator we have that y00 > 0 when x > 0 and\ny00 < 0 when -1 < x < 0. Finally, y00 > 0 when x < -1, and both numerator and\ndenominator are negative.\nCritical value: y(2-1/3) = 2-2/3 + 21/3 ≈ 1.9\nSingular value: y(0+) = +inf and y(0-) = -inf\nEndpoint values: y →inf as x → ±inf\nP\nP is the critical point\nConclusions: The function decreases from inf to -inf in the interval (-inf, 0).\nTherefore it vanishes exactly once in this interval. It jumps to inf at 0 and decreases\nfrom inf to 2-2/3 + 21/3 in the interval (0, 2-1/3). Finally it increases from 2-2/3 +\n21/3 to inf in the interval (2-1/3 , inf). Thus it does not vanish on the interval (0, inf).\nThe function is concave up in the intervals (-inf, -1) and (0, inf) and concave down\nin the interval (-1, 0), with an inflection point at -1.\n2F-4 From the graph, x5 - x - c = 0 has three roots for any small value of c.

Solutions to 18.01 Exercises\nP\ny=c\n2F-5 a) Answer: x1 = ±1/\n√\n3. f(x) = x - x , so f 0(x) = 1 - 3x2 and\nxn+1 = xn - f(xn)/f 0(xn)\nSo x2 is undefined if f 0(x1) = 0, that is x1 = ±1/\n√\n3.\nb) Answer: x1 = ±1/\n√\n5. (This value can be found by experimentation. It\ncan be also be found by iterating the inverse of the Newton method function.)\nHere is an explanation: Using the fact that f is odd and that x3 = x1 suggests\nthat x2 = -x1. This greatly simplifies the equation.\nxn+1 = xn - (xn - x 3 )/(1 - 3x 2 ) = 1\n-\n-\nx\nx\nn\nn\nn\nn\nTherefore we want to find x satisfying\n-x = 1\n-\n-\nx\nx\nThis equation is the same as x(1 - 3x2) = 2x3, which implies x = 0 or 5x2 = 1. In\nother words, x = ±1/\n√\n5. Now one can check that if x1 = 1/\n√\n5, then x2 = -1/\n√\n5,\nx3 = +1/\n√\n5, etc.\nc) Answers: If x1 < -1/\n√\n3, then xn →-1. If x1 > 1/\n√\n3, then xn → 1. If\n-1/\n√\n5 < x1 < 1/\n√\n5, then xn → 0. This can be found experimentally, numerically.\nFor a complete analysis and proof one needs the methods of an upper level course\nlike 18.100.\n2F-6 a) To simplify this problem to its essence, let V = π. (We are looking for\nratio r/h and this will be the same no matter what value we pick for V .) Thus\nr2h = 1 and\nA = πr2 + 2π/r\nMinimize B = A/π instead.\nB = r 2 + 2r-1 = ⇒ B0 = 2r - 2r-2\nand B0 = 0 implies r = 1. Endpoints: B →inf as r\n0 and as r →inf, so we have\nfound the minimum at r = 1. (The constraint r2h\n→\n= 1 shows that this minimum\nis achieved when r = h = 1. As a doublecheck, the fact that the minimum area is\nachieved for r/h = 1 follows from 2C/5; see part (b).)\nThe minimum of B is 3 attained at r = 1. Ten percent more than the\n\nE. Solutions to 18.01 Exercises\n2. Applications of Differentiation\nminimum is 3.3, so we need to find all r such that\nB(r) ≤ 3.3\nUse Newton's method with F (r) = B(r) - 3.3. (It is unwise to start Newton's\nmethod at r = 1. Why?) The roots of F are approximately r = 1.35 and r = .72.\nB\nB=3.3\n(1,3)\nr\nallowable\nr-interval\nSince r2h = 1, h = 1/r2 and the ratio,\nr/h = r 3\nCompute (1.35)3 ≈ 2.5 and (.72)3 ≈ .37. Therefore, the proportions with at most\n10 percent extra glass are approximately\n.37 < r/h < 2.5\nb) The connection with Problem 2C-5 is that the minimum area r = h\nis not entirely obvious, and not just because we are dealing with glass beakers\ninstead of tin cans. In 2C/5 the area is fixed whereas here the volume is held fixed.\nBut because one needs a larger surface area to hold a larger volume, maximizing\nvolume with fixed area is the same problem as minimizing surface area with fixed\nvolume. This is an important so-called duality principle often used in optimization\nproblems. In Problem 2C-5 the answer was r = h, which is the proportion with\nminimum surface area as confirmed in part (a).\n\np\n2. Applications of Differentiation\nE.

Therefore,\n0 = x + yy0 = x - cos x sin x\nThere is one obvious solution x = 0. The reason why this problem is in this section\nis that one needs the tools of inequalities to make sure that there are no other\nsolutions. Indeed, if\nf(x) = x - cos x sin x, then f 0(x) = 1 - cos 2 x + sin2 x = 2 sin2 x ≥ 0\nFurthermore, f 0(x)0 is strictly positive except at the points x = kπ, so f is increas\ning and crosses zero exactly once.\nThere is only one critical point and the distance tends to infinity at the endpoints\nx → ±inf, so this point is the minimum. The point on the graph closest to the origin\nis (0, 1).\ny = cos x\nAlternative method: To show that (0, 1) is closest it suffices to show that for\n-1 ≤ x < 0 and 0 < x ≤ 1,\n1 - x2 < cos x\nSquaring gives 1 - x2 < cos2 x. This can be proved using the principles of problems\n6 and 7. The derivative of cos2 x - (1 - x2) is twice the function f above, so the\nmethods are very similar.\n\nE.

Therefore, between the n roots a1, . . . , an of p(x), lie at least n - 1 roots\nof p0(x).\nThere are no more than n - 1 roots, since degree of p0(x) = n - 1; thus p0(x) has\nexactly n - 1 roots.\n2G-5 Assume f(x) = 0 at a, b, c.\nBy Rolle's theorem (as in MVT-4), there are two points q1, q2 where f 0(q1) =\n0, f 0(q2) = 0.\nBy Rolle's theorem again, applied to q1 and q2 and f 0(x), there is a point p where\nf 00(p) = 0.

Therefore f(x2) > f(x1),\nwhich shows f(x) is increasing .\nb) We have f(x) = f(a) + f 0(c)(x - a) where a < c < x.\nSince f 0(c) = 0, f(x) = f(a) for a ≤ x ≤ b, which shows f(x) is constant on [a, b].\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.01SC Single Variable Calculus\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The function is defined, continuous and differentiable for -inf < x < 1.\nBut at x = 1, y and dy/dx are undefined. Since y = 1/(1 - x) is the only solution\nto the differential equation in the interval (0, 1) that satisfies the initial condition\ny(0) = 1, it is impossible to define a function that has the initial condition y(0) = 1\nand also satisfies the differential equation in any longer interval containing x = 1.\nTo ask what happens to y after x = 1, say at x = 3/2, is something like asking\nwhat happened to a rocket ship after it fell into a black hole. There is no obvious\nreason why one has to choose the formula y = 1/(1 - x) after the \"explosion.\"\nFor example, one could define y = 1/(2 - x) for 1 ≤ x < 2.

      "content": "The Derivative of |x|\nThe slope of the graph of f(x) = |x| changes abruptly when x = 0. Does this\nfunction have a derivative? If so, what is it? If not, why not?\nSolution\nAt first glance, this seems like a simple question. To the right of y-axis the graph\nof f(x) has slope +1. To the left of the y-axis it has slope -1. It's reasonable\nto conclude that:\n\nf 0(x) =\nx > 0,\n-1 x < 0.\nHowever, this description of the derivative leaves out the value of f 0(0).\nOur formula for the derivative tells us that:\nf 0(0) = lim f(0 + Δx) - f(0) = lim f(Δx) .\nΔx\nΔx\nΔx\n0 Δx\n→\n→\nThe slope of the secant line joining the points (0, 0) and (Δx, f(Δx)) is:\nf(0 + Δx) - f(0) = f(Δx) .\nΔx\nΔx\nWhat is the value of this expression when Δx gets close to (but not equal to)\nzero?\nIf Δx > 0 then f(Δx) = Δx and\nf(Δx) = 1.\nΔx\nIf Δx < 0 then f(Δx) = -1 Δx and\n·\nf(Δx) = -1.\nΔx\nThe value of f(Δx) doesn't depend on the size of Δx and doesn't necessarily\nconverge to a single value as Δx shrinks. The \"limit as Δx approaches 0\" isn't\nwell defined, so f(x) is not differentiable at x = 0.\nIf we try to find f 0(0) by finding the slope of the tangent line to the graph\nof f(x) at x = 0, we have problems finding that tangent line. Our intuition\nabout the tangent line tells us that any line tangent to the graph at (0, 0) must\ngo through (0, 0) and then \"follow the direction of the graph\" near (0, 0). The\nline y = x goes through (0, 0) and follows the positive side of the graph; the\nline y = -x does the same in the negative direction. Neither of these two lines\nfollow the graph away from (0, 0) in both directions. The line y = 0 looks\npromising but doesn't follow the graph in either direction, nor is it the limit of\nany sequence of secant lines through (0, 0). There is no tangent line to the graph\nof f(x) = |x| at the point (0, 0), so the slope f 0(x) is not defined for x = 0.\nEither way, we conclude that if f(x) = |x|, f 0(0) is undefined. We say that\nf(x) is not differentiable at x = 0. If a function f(x) is not differentiable at\neven one point in its domain, f(x) is not a differentiable function.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.01SC Single Variable Calculus\n\nFall 2010\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Month\nBalance ($)\nJanuary\nFebruary\nMarch\n. . .\n. . .\nChecking Account Balances\nThe derivative of a function f(t) describes how the function's output changes\nas the value of t changes.\nSuppose that a checking account has balance f(t) = -5t2 + 60t + 120 dollars\nt months into the year, and that the derivative (rate of change) of the account\nbalance is given by f 0(t) = -10t + 60.\n1. Compute f 0(1). If f 0(1) is approximately equal to the rate of change of the\naccount balance during the month of January, will the account balance in\nFebruary be greater or less than the balance in January?\n2. Compute f 0(10). Does the account balance continue to increase through\nout the year? How do you know?\n3. During which month is the account balance greatest? What is the value\nof f 0(t) at this time?\nSolution\n1. Compute f 0(1). If f 0(1) is approximately equal to the rate of change of the\naccount balance during the month of January, will the account balance in\nFebruary be greater or less than the balance in January?\nf 0(1) = -10(1) + 60\n= 50dollars per month\nIn January, the account balance is changing by a positive $50 per month.\nThe account balance in February should be roughly $50 greater than the\nJanuary balance. We can see from the table of values of f(t) that this is\na reasonable answer, and also that the approximation is not exact.\n2. Compute f 0(10). Does the account balance continue to increase through\nout the year? How do you know?\nf 0(10) = -10 10 + 60\n·\n= -40dollars per month\n\nWe expect the account balance to be decreasing by approximately $40/month\nin October; the account balance will not continue to increase throughout\nthe year. We can check this answer by confirming that f(11) = $175 is\napproximately $40 less than f(10) = $220.\nThe value of f 0(10) describes the instantaneous rate of change of f(t) when\nthe time elapsed is exactly t = 10 months and corresponds to the slope of\nthe line tangent to the graph of f(t) at the point (10, 220). The difference\nf(10)-f(11) is the average rate of change between time t = 10 and t = 11\nand corresponds to the slope of a secant line of the graph of f(t).\n3. During which month is the account balance greatest? What is the value\nof f 0(t) at this time?\nWe could answer the first part of this problem by calculating balances for\nthe remaining six months of the year, but that's somewhat tedious and\nunenlightening. Instead, we observe that the account balance is increasing\nwhen f 0(t) > 0 and decreasing when f 0(t) < 0. By graphing the equation\ny = f 0(t) we find that the account balance should increase until month 6\n(June) and then decrease thereafter.\nMore experienced problem solvers might observe that f 0(t) is a continuous\nfunction that is always decreasing and find the point where f(t) chanes\nfrom increaseing to decreasing by solving the equation f 0(t) = 0:\nf 0(t)\n=\n-10t + 60 = 0\n-10t = -60\n-10t\n-60\n=\n-10\n-10\nt =\nThe account balance is expected to be greatest in June, at which time:\nf 0(t) = f 0(6) = -10(6) + 60 = 0.\nTo check our work, we compute that f(6) = 300, f(5) = 295, and f(7) =\n295.

      "content": "Continuous but not Smooth\nFind values of the constants a and b for which the following function is contin\nuous but not differentiable.\n\nax + b, x > 0;\nf(x) =\nsin 2x,\nx ≤ 0.\nIn other words, the graph of the function should have a sharp corner at the pont\n(0, f(0)).\nSolution\nBecause g(x) = ax+b and h(x) = sin 2x are continuous functions, the only place\nwhere f(x) might be discontinuous is where x = 0. To make f(x) continuous,\nwe need to find values of a and b for which:\nlim f(x) = lim f(x).\nx→0+\nx→0-\nWe start with limx→0+ f(x) because we find linear functions easier to work\nwith than trigonometric ones:\nlim f(x) =\nlim ax + b\nx→0+\nx→0+\n= a · 0 + b\n= b.\nNext we find limx→0- f(x):\nlim f(x) =\nlim sin 2x\nx→0-\nx→0-\n= sin 0\n=\n0.\nIn order for f(x) to be continuous at 0, it must be true that b = 0.\nNext we need to determine when f(x) is not differentiable. To the right of\nx = 0, the graph of f(x) is a straight line. To the left, the graph is a smooth\ncurve. As long as x = 0, the graph of f(x) has a well defined tangent line at\nthe point (x, f(x)).\nTherefore, if f(x) is differentiable at x = 0 then it is differentiable overall.\nThe function is differentiable if it has a well defined tangent line at x = 0. This\nwill be true when the slope of the line y = ax + b = ax + 0 equals the slope of\nthe curve y = sin 2x at the point (0, 0). We'll learn later that the slope of the\ncurve y = sin 2x equals 2 cos 2x; for now it's enough to know that the slope of\ny = sin 2x is positive when x = 0.\nWe conclude that f(x) is continuous but not differentiable for b = 0 and any\na ≤ 0. In fact, for any value of a other than 2 the function will be continuous\nbut not differentiable.\nWe can check our work by graphing f(x) for a few different values of a\n(while b = 0). This increases our familiarity with graphs of continuous but\nnon-differentiable functions.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.01SC Single Variable Calculus\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
