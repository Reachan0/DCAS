Definition and Scaling of Surface Tension\n2.2\nMotivation: Who cares about surface tension?\nAs we shall soon see, surface tension dominates gravity on a scale less than the capillary length (roughly\n2mm). It thus plays a critical role in a variety of small-scale processes arising in biology, environmental\nscience and technology.\nBiology\n- all small creatures live in a world dominated\nby surface tension\n- surface tension important for insects for many\nbasic functions\n- weight support and propulsion at the water\nsurface\n- adhesion and deadhesion via surface tension\n- the pistol shrimp: hunting with bubbles\n- underwater breathing and diving via surface\ntension\n- natural\nstrategies\nfor\nwater-repellency\nin\nplants and animals\n- the dynamics of lungs and the role of surfac\ntants and impurities\nFigure 2.1: The diving bell spider\nGeophysics and environmental science\n- the dynamics of raindrops and their role in the\nbiosphere\n- most biomaterial is surface active, sticks to the\nsurface of drops / bubbles\n- chemical, thermal and biological transport in\nthe surf zone\n- early life:\nearly vessicle formation, confine\nment to an interface\n- oil recovery, carbon sequestration, groundwa\nter flows\n- design of insecticides intended to coat insects,\nleave plant unharmed\n- chemical leaching and the water-repellency of\nsoils\n- oil spill dynamics and mitigation\n- disease transmission via droplet exhalation\n- dynamics of magma chambers and volcanoes\n- the exploding lakes of Cameroon\nTechnology\n- capillary effects dominant in microgravity set\ntings: NASA\n- cavitation-induced damage on propellers and\nsubmarines\n- cavitation in medicine: used to damage kidney\nstones, tumours ...\n- design of superhydrophobic surfaces e.g. self-\ncleaning windows, drag-reducing or erosion-\nresistant surfaces\n- lab-on-a-chip technology: medical diagnostics,\ndrug delivery\n- microfluidics:\ncontinuous and discrete fluid\ntransport and mixing\n- tracking submarines with their surface signa\nture\n- inkjet printing\n- the bubble computer\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

Surface tension: a working definition\nChapter 2. Definition and Scaling of Surface Tension\nFigure 2.2: a) The free surface between air and water at a molecular scale. b) Surface tension is analogous\nto a negative surface pressure.\n2.3\nSurface tension: a working definition\nDiscussions of the molecular origins of surface or interfacial tension may be found elsewhere (e.g. Is\nraelachvili 1995, Rowlinson & Widom 1982). Our discussion follows that of de Gennes, Brochard-Wyart\n& Qu er e 2003.\nMolecules in a fluid feel a mutual attraction.\nWhen this attractive force is overcome by thermal\nagitation, the molecules pass into a gaseous phase.\nLet us first consider a free surface, for example\nthat between air and water (Fig. 2.2a). A water molecule in the fluid bulk is surrounded by attractive\nneighbours, while a molecule at the surface has a reduced number of such neighbours and so in an\nenergetically unfavourable state.\nThe creation of new surface is thus energetically costly, and a fluid\nsystem will act to minimize surface areas. It is thus that small fluid bodies tend to evolve into spheres;\nfor example, a thin fluid jet emerging from your kitchen sink will generally pinch offinto spherical drops\nin order to minimize the total surface area (see Lecture 5).\nIf U is the total cohesive energy per molecule, then a molecule at a free surface will lose U/2 relative to\nmolecules in the bulk. Surface tension is a direct measure of this energy loss per unit area of surface. If the\ncharacteristic molecular dimension is R and its area thus R2, then the surface tension is σ ∼ U/(2R)2 . Note\nthat surface tension increases as the intermolecular attraction increases and the molecular size decreases.\nFor most oils, σ ∼ 20 dynes/cm, while for water, σ ∼ 70 dynes/cm. The highest surface tensions are\nfor liquid metals; for example, liquid mercury has σ ∼ 500 dynes/cm. The origins of interfacial tension\nare analogous.\nInterfacial tension is a material property of a fluid-fluid interface whose origins lie in\nthe different energy per area that acts to resist the creation of new interface. Fluids between which no\ninterfacial tension arises are said to be miscible. For example, salt molecules will diffuse freely across a\nboundary between fresh and salt water; consequently, these fluids are miscible, and there is no interfacial\ntension between them. Our discussion will be confined to immiscible fluid-fluid interfaces (or fluid-gas\nsurfaces), at which an effective interfacial (or surface) tension acts.\nSurface tension σ has the units of force/length or equivalently energy/area, and so may be thought\nof as a negative surface pressure, or, equivalently, as a line tension acting in all directions parallel to the\nsurface. Pressure is generally an isotropic force per area that acts throughout the bulk of a fluid: small\nsurface element dS will feel a total force p(x)dS owing to the local pressure field p(x). If the surface S is\nclosed, and the pressure uniform, the net pressure force acting on S is zero and the fluid remains static.\nPressure gradients correspond to body forces (with units of force per unit volume) within a fluid, and so\nappear explicitly in the Navier-Stokes equations. Surface tension has the units of force per length, and\nits action is confined to the free surface. Consider for the sake of simplicity a perfectly flat interface. A\nsurface line element dl will feel a total force σdl owing to the local surface tension σ(x). If the surface\nline element is a closed loop C, and the surface tension uniform, the net surface tension force acting on\nC is zero, and the fluid remains static. If surface tension gradients arise, there may be a net force on the\nsurface element that acts to distort it through driving flow.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n2.4. Governing Equations\nChapter 2. Definition and Scaling of Surface Tension\n2.4\nGoverning Equations\nThe motion of a fluid of uniform density ρ and dynamic viscosity μ is governed by the Navier-Stokes\nequations, which represent a continuum statement of Newton's laws.\n(∂u\n)\nρ\n+ u · ∇u\n= -∇p + F + μ∇2 u\n(2.1)\n∂t\n∇· u = 0\n(2.2)\nThis represents a system of 4 equations in 4 unknowns (the fluid pressure p and the three components of\nthe velocity field u). Here F represents any body force acting on a fluid; for example, in the presence of\na gravitational field, F = ρg where g is the acceleration due to gravity.\nSurface tension acts only at the free surface; consequently, it does not appear in the Navier-Stokes\nequations, but rather enters through the boundary conditions. The boundary conditions appropriate at a\nfluid-fluid interface are formally developed in Lecture 3. We here simply state them for the simple case of\na free surface (such as air-water, in which one of the fluids is not dynamically significant) in order to get\na feeling for the scaling of surface tension. The normal stress balance at a free surface must be balanced\nby the curvature pressure associated with the surface tension:\nn · T · n = σ(∇· n)\n(2.3)\n[\n1 [\nwhere T = -pI + μ ∇u + (∇u)T ]\n= -pI + 2μE is the stress tensor, E =\n∇u + (∇u)T ]\nis the\ndeviatoric stress tensor, and n is the unit normal to the surface. The tangential stress at a free surface\nmust balance the local surface tension gradient:\nn · T · t = ∇σ · t\n(2.4)\nwhere t is the unit tangent to the interface.\n2.5\nThe scaling of surface tension\nFundamental Concept The laws of Nature cannot depend on arbitrarily chosen system of units. Any\nphysical system is most succinctly described in terms of dimensionless variables.\nBuckingham's Theorem For a system with M physical variables (e.g. density, speed, length, viscosity)\ndescribable in terms of N fundamental units (e.g. mass, length, time, temperature), there are M - N\ndimensionless groups that govern the system.\nE.g. Translation of a rigid sphere through a viscous fluid:\nPhysical variables: sphere speed U and radius a, fluid viscosity ν and density ρ and sphere drag D; M = 5.\nFundamental units: mass M, length L and time T; N = 3.\nBuckingham's Theorem: there are M - N = 2 dimensionless groups: Cd = D/ρU 2 and Re = Ua/ν.\nSystem is uniquely determined by a single relation between the two: Cd = F(Re).\nWe consider a fluid of density ρ and viscosity μ = ρν with a free surface characterized by a surface tension\nσ. The flow is marked by characteristic length- and velocity- scales of, respectively, a and U, and evolves\nin the presence of a gravitational field g = -gzˆ. We thus have a physical system defined in terms of six\nphysical variables (ρ, ν, σ, a, U, g) that may be expressed in terms of three fundamental units: mass, length\nand time. Buckingham's Theorem thus indicates that the system may be uniquely described in terms of\nthree dimensionless groups. We choose\nUa\nInertia\nRe =\n=\n= Reynolds number\n(2.5)\nν\nViscosity\nU 2\nInertia\nFr =\n=\n= Froude number\n(2.6)\nga\nGravity\nρga2\nGravity\nBo =\n=\n= Bond number\n(2.7)\nσ\nCurvature\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n2.5. The scaling of surface tension\nChapter 2. Definition and Scaling of Surface Tension\nThe Reynolds number prescribes the relative magnitudes of inertial and viscous forces in the system,\nwhile the Froude number those of inertial and gravity forces. The Bond number indicates the relative\nimportance of forces induced by gravity and surface tension. Note that these two forces are comparable\n1/2\nwhen Bo = 1, which arises at a lengthscale corresponding to the capillary length: lc = (σ/(ρg))\n. For\nan air-water surface, for example, σ ≈ 70 dynes/cm, ρ = 1g/cm3 and g = 980 cm/s2, so that lc ≈ 2mm.\nBodies of water in air are dominated by the influence of surface tension provided they are smaller than the\ncapillary length. Roughly speaking, the capillary length prescribes the maximum size of pendant drops\nthat may hang inverted from a ceiling, water-walking insects, and raindrops. Note that as a fluid system\nbecomes progressively smaller, the relative importance of surface tension over gravity increases; it is thus\nthat surface tension effects are critical in many in microscale engineering processes and in the lives of\nbugs.\nFinally, we note that other frequently arising dimensionless groups may be formed from the products\nof Bo, Re and Fr:\nρU 2a\nInertia\nWe =\n=\n= Weber number\n(2.8)\nσ\nCurvature\nρνU\nViscous\nCa =\n=\n= Capillary number\n(2.9)\nσ\nCurvature\nThe Weber number indicates the relative magnitudes of inertial and curvature forces within a fluid, and\nthe capillary number those of viscous and curvature forces. Finally, we note that if the flow is marked by\na Marangoni stress of characteristic magnitude Δσ/L, then an additional dimensionless group arises that\ncharacterizes the relative magnitude of Marangoni and curvature stresses:\naΔσ\nMarangoni\nMa =\n=\n= Marangoni number\n(2.10)\nLσ\nCurvature\nWe now demonstrate how these dimensionless groups arise naturally from the nondimensionalization of\nNavier-Stokes equations and the surface boundary conditions. We first introduce a dynamic pressure:\npd = p - ρg · x, so that gravity appears only in the boundary conditions. We consider the special case of\nhigh Reynolds number flow, for which the characteristic dynamic pressure is ρU 2 . We define dimensionless\nprimed variables according to:\na\n′\n′\n′\n′\nu = Uu ,\npd = ρU 2 pd ,\nx = ax ,\nt =\nt\n,\n(2.11)\nU\nwhere a and U are characteristic lenfth and velocity scales. Nondimensionalizing the Navier-Stokes equa\ntions and appropriate boundary conditions yields the following system:\n(∂u ′\n)\n′ ∇ ′\n′\n′\n∇ ′2 ′\n′\n+ u ·\nu\n= -∇pd +\nu , ∇ ′ · u = 0\n(2.12)\n∂t′\nRe\nThe normal stress condition assumes the dimensionless form:\n′\n′\nE ′\n∇ ′\n-pd +\nz +\nn ·\n· n =\n· n\n(2.13)\nFr\nRe\nWe\nThe relative importance of surface tension to gravity is prescribed by the Bond number Bo, while that\nof surface tension to viscous stresses by the capillary number Ca. In the high Re limit of interest, the\nnormal force balance requires that the dynamic pressure be balanced by either gravitational or curvature\nstresses, the relative magnitudes of which are prescribed by the Bond number.\nThe nondimensionalization scheme will depend on the physical system of interest. Our purpose here\nwas simply to illustrate the manner in which the dimensionless groups arise in the theoretical formulation\nof the problem.\nMoreover, we see that those involving surface tension enter exclusively through the\nboundary conditions.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

What sets their size?\nKnowing nothing of surface chemistry, one anticipates that Laplace pressure balances hydrostatic pressure\nJ\nif σ/H ≥ ρgH ⇒ H < lc =\nσ/ρg = capillary length.\nNote:\n1. Drops with R < lc remain heavily spherical\n2. Large drops spread to depth H ∼ lc so that\nLaplace + hydrostatic pressures balance at the\ndrop's edge.\nA volume V will thus spread\nto a radius R s.t.\nπR2lc = V , from which\n1/2\nR = (V/πlc)\n.\n3. This is the case for H2O on most surfaces,\nFigure 3.1: Spreading of drops of increasing size.\nwhere a contact line exists.\nNote: In general, surface chemistry can dominate and one need not have a contact line.\nMore generally, wetting occurs at fluid-solid contact. Two possibilities exist: partial wetting or total\nwetting, depending on the surface energies of the 3 interfaces (γLV , γSV , γSL).\nNow, just as σ = γLV is a surface energy per area or tensile force per length at a liquid-vapour surface,\nγSL and γSV are analogous quantities at solid-liquid and solid-vapour interfaces.\nThe degree of wetting determined by spreading parameters:\nS = [Esubstrate]dry - [Esubstrate]wet = γSV - (γSL + γLV )\n(3.1)\nwhere only γLV can be easily measured.\nTotal Wetting: S > 0 , θe = 0 liquid spreads completely in order to minimize its surface energy. e.g.\nsilicon on glass, water on clean glass.\nNote: Silicon oil is more likely to spread than H2O since σw ∼ 70 dyn/cm > σs.o. ∼ 20 dyn/cm. Final\nresult: a film of nanoscopic thickness resulting from competition between molecular and capillary forces.\nPartial wetting: S < 0, θe > 0. In absence of\ng, forms a spherical cap meeting solid at a con\ntact angle θe. A liquid is \"wetting\" on a particular\nsolid when θe < π/2, non-wetting or weakly wetting\nwhen θe > π/2.

M. Bush\n\n5.3. Fluid Statics\nChapter 5. Stress Boundary Conditions\n5.3\nFluid Statics\nWe begin by considering static fluid configurations, for which the stress tensor reduces to the form T = -pI,\nso that n · T · n = -p, and the normal stress balance equation (5.8) assumes the simple form:\npˆ- p = σ∇· n\n(5.17)\nThe pressure jump across a static interface is balanced by the curvature force at the interface. Now since\nn · T · d = 0 for a static system, the tangential stress balance indicates that ∇σ = 0. This leads to\nthe following important conclusion: There cannot be a static system in the presence of surface tension\ngradients. While pressure jumps can sustain normal stress jumps across a fluid interface, they do not\ncontribute to the tangential stress jump. Consequently, tangential surface (Marangoni) stresses can only\nbe balanced by viscous stresses associated with fluid motion. We proceed by applying equation (5.17) to\ndescribe a number of static situations.\n1. Stationary Bubble : We consider a spherical air bubble of radius R submerged in a static fluid.\nWhat is the pressure drop across the bubble surface?\nThe divergence in spherical coordinates of F = (Fr, Fθ, Fφ) is given by\n1 ∂ (\n)\n∂\n∂\n∇· F =\nr2Fr +\n(sin θFθ) +\nFφ.\nr2 ∂r\nr sin θ ∂θ\nr sin φ ∂φ\n1 ∂\nHence ∇· n|S =\nr2|r=R =\nso the normal stress jump (5.17) indicates that\nr2 ∂r\nR\n2σ\nΔP = pˆ- p =\n(5.18)\nR\nThe pressure within the bubble is higher than that outside by an amount proportional to the surface\ntension, and inversely proportional to the bubble size. As noted in Lec. 2, it is thus that small bubbles\nare louder than large ones when they burst at a free surface: champagne is louder than beer. We note\nthat soap bubbles in air have two surfaces that define the inner and outer surfaces of the soap film;\nconsequently, the pressure differential is twice that across a single interface.\n2.

We treat\nthe contact angle θe as given; noting that it depends in general on the surface energy.\nThe normal\nforce balance is expressed by the Young-Laplace equation, where now ρ = ρw - ρair ≈ ρw is the density\ndifference between water and air.\nWe define the free surface by z = η(x); equivalently, we define a\nfunctional f(x, z) = z - η(x) that vanishes on the surface. The normal to the surface z = η(x) is thus\n∇f\nzˆ - η′(x)xˆ\nn =\n=\n(5.20)\n|∇f|\n[1 + η′(x)2]1/2\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n5.3. Fluid Statics\nChapter 5.

The meniscus formed by an object floating in water is exponen-\ntial, decaying over a length scale lc. Note that this behaviour may be rationalized as follows: the system\narranges itself so that its total energy (grav. potential + surface) is minimized.\n3. Floating Bodies\nFloating bodies must be supported by some combination of buoyancy and curvature forces.

Water-walking Insects\nSmall objects such as paper clips, pins or insects may reside at rest on a free surface provided the curvature\nforce induced by their deflection of the free surface is sufficient to bear their weight (Fig. 5.5a). For example,\nfor a body of contact length L and total mass M, static equilibrium on the free surface requires that:\nMg\n< 1 ,\n(5.35)\n2σL sin θ\nwhere θ is the angle of tangency of the floating body.\nThis simple criterion is an important geometric constraint on water-walking insects. Fig. 5.5b indicates\nthe dependence of contact length on body weight for over 300 species of water-striders, the most common\nwater walking insect. Note that the solid line corresponds to the requirement (5.35) for static equilibrium.\nSmaller insects maintain a considerable margin of safety, while the larger striders live close to the edge.\nThe maximum size of water-walking insects is limited by the constraint (5.35).\nIf body proportions were independent of size L, one would expect the body weight to scale as L3 and\nthe curvature force as L. Isometry would thus suggest a dependence of the form Fc ∼ Fg\n1/3, represented\nas the dashed line. The fact that the best fit line has a slope considerably larger than 1/3 indicates a\nvariance from isometry: the legs of large water striders are proportionally longer.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

M. Bush\n\n9. Marangoni Flows\nMarangoni flows are those driven by surface gradients. In general, surface tension σ depends on both the\ntemperature and chemical composition at the interface; consequently, Marangoni flows may be generated\nby gradients in either temperature or chemical composition at an interface. We previously derived the\ntangential stress balance at a free surface:\nn · T · t = -t · ∇σ ,\n(9.1)\nwhere n is the unit outward normal to the surface, and t is any unit tangent vector. The tangential\ncomponent of the hydrodynamic stress at the surface must balance the tangential stress associated with\ngradients in σ. Such Marangoni stresses may result from gradients in temperature or chemical composition\nat the interface. For a static system, since n · T · t = 0, the tangential stress balance equation indicates\nthat: 0 = ∇σ. This leads us to the following important conclusion:\nThere cannot be a static system in the presence of surface tension gradients.\nWhile pressure jumps can arise in static systems characterized by a normal stress jump across a fluid\ninterface, they do not contribute to the tangential stress jump. Consequently, tangential surface stresses\ncan only be balanced by viscous stresses associated with fluid motion.\nThermocapillary flows: Marangoni flows induced by temperature gradients σ(T).\ndσ\nNote that in general\n< 0 Why? A warmer gas phase has more liquid molecules, so the creation of\ndT\nsurface is less energetically unfavourable; therefore, σ is lower.\nApproach Through the interfacial BCs (and σ(T)'s appearance therein), N-S equations must be coupled\nFigure 9.1: Surface tension of a gas-liquid interface decreases with temperature since a warmer gas phase\ncontains more suspended liquid molecules.

Marangoni Flows II\n10.1\nTears of Wine\nThe first Marangoni flow considered was the tears of wine phenomenon (Thomson 1885), which actually\npredates Marangoni's first published work on the subject by a decade. The tears of wine phenomenon\nis readily observed in a wine glass following the establishment of a thin layer of wine on the walls of the\nglass.\nAn illustration of the tears of wine phenomenon is shown in Fig. 10.1. Evaporation of alcohol occurs\neverywhere along the free surface. The alcohol concentration in the thin layer is thus reduced relative to\nthat in the bulk owing to the enhanced surface area to volume ratio. As surface tension decreases with\nalcohol concentration, the surface tension is higher in the thin film than the bulk; the associated Marangoni\nstress drives upflow throughout the thin film. The wine climbs until reaching the top of the film, where\nit accumulates in a band of fluid that thickens until eventually becoming gravitationally unstable and\nreleasing the tears of wine. The tears or \"legs\" roll back to replenish the bulk reservoir, but with fluid\nthat is depleted in alcohol.\nThe flow relies on the transfer of chemical potential energy to kinetic and ultimately gravitational\npotential energy. The process continues until the fuel for the process, the alcohol is completely depleted.\nFor certain liquors (e.g. port), the climbing film, a Marangoni shear layer, goes unstable to streamwise\nvortices and an associated radial corrugation - the \"tear ducts of wine\" (Hosoi & Bush, JFM 2001). When\nthe descending tears reach the bath, they appear to recoil in response to the abrupt change in σ. The\ntears or legs of wine are taken by sommeliers to be an indicator of the quality of wine.\nFigure 10.1: The tears of wine. Fluid is drawn from the bulk up the thin film adjoining the walls of the\nglass by Marangoni stresses induced by evaporation of alcohol from the free surface.\n\n10.2. Surfactants\nChapter 10. Marangoni Flows II\nFigure 10.2: a) A typical molecular structure of surfactants. b) The typical dependence of σ on surfactant\nconcentration c.\n10.2\nSurfactants\nSurfactants are molecules that have an affinity for interfaces; common examples include soap and oil.\nOwing to their molecular structure (e.g. a hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail, Fig. 10.2a), they\nfind it energetically favourable to reside at the free surface. Their presence reduces the surface tension;\nconsequently, gradients in surfactant concentration Γ result in surface tension gradients. Surfactants thus\ngenerate a special class of Marangoni flows. There are many different types of surfactants, some of which\nare insoluble (and so remain on the surface), others of which are soluble in the suspending fluid and\nso diffuse into the bulk. For a wide range of common surfactants, surface tension is a monotonically\ndecreasing function of Γ until a critical micell concentration (CMC) is achieved, beyond CMC there is no\nfurther dependence of σ on Γ (Fig. 10.2b).\nSurfactant properties:\n- Diffusivity prescribes the rate of diffusion, Ds (bulk diffusivity Db), of a surfactant along an\ninterface\n- Solubility prescribes the ease with which surfactant passes from the surface to the bulk. An\ninsoluble surfactant cannot dissolve into the bulk, must remain on the surface.\n- Volatility prescribes the ease with which surfactant sublimates.\nTheoretical Approach: because of the dependence of σ on the surfactant concentration, and the ap\npearance of σ in the boundary conditions, N-S equations must be augmented by an equation governing\nthe evolution of Γ. In the bulk,\n∂c\n= Db∇2\n+ u · ∇c\nc\n(10.1)\n∂t\nThe concentration of surfactant Γ on a free surface evolves according to\n∂Γ\n∇2\n+ ∇s · (Γus) + Γ (∇s · n) (u · n) = J (Γ, Cs) + Ds\nΓ\n(10.2)\ns\n∂t\nwhere us is the surface velocity, ∇s is the surface gradient operator and Ds is the surface diffusivity of\nthe surfactant (Stone 1999). J is a surfactant source term associated with adsorption onto or desorption\nfrom the surface, and depends on both the surface surfactant concentration Γ and the concentration in the\nbulk Cs. Tracing the evolution of a contaminated free surface requires the use of Navier-Stokes equations,\nrelevant boundary conditions and the surfactant evolution equation (10.2). The dependence of surface\ntension on surfactant concentration, σ(Γ), requires the coupling of the flow field and surfactant field. In\ncertain special cases, the system may be made more tractable. For example, for insoluble surfactants,\nJ = 0. Many surfactants have sufficiently small Ds that surface diffusivity may be safely neglected.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M.

One can think of a clean interface as a \"slippery trampoline\" that resists\ndeformation through generation of normal curvature pressures. However, such a surface cannot generate\ntraction on the interface. However, a surface-laden interface, like a trampoline, resists surface deformation\nas does a clean interface, but can also support tangential stresses via Marangoni elasticity. Specifically,\nthe presence of surfactants will serve not only to alter the normal stress balance (through the reduction\nof σ), but also the tangential stress balance through the generation of Marangoni stresses.\nThe presence of surfactants will act to suppress any fluid motion characterized by non-zero surface\ndivergence. For example, consider a fluid motion characterized by a radially divergent surface motion.\nThe presence of surfactants results in the redistribution of surfactants: Γ is reduced near the point of\ndivergence. The resulting Marangoni stresses act to suppress the surface motion, resisting it through an\neffective surface elasticity. Similarly, if the flow is characterized by a radial convergence, the resulting\naccumulation of surfactant in the region of convergence will result in Marangoni stresses that serve to\nresist it. It is this effective elasticity that gives soap films their longevity: the divergent motions that\nwould cause a pure liquid film to rupture are suppressed by the surfactant layer on the soap film surface.\nThe ability of surfactant to suppress flows with non-zero surface divergence is evident throughout\nthe natural world. It was first remarked upon by Pliny the Elder, who rationalized that the absence of\ncapillary waves in the wake of ships is due to the ships stirring up surfactant. This phenomenon was also\nwidely known to spear-fishermen, who poured oil on the water to increase their ability to see their prey,\nand by sailors, who would do similarly in an attempt to calm troubled seas. Finally, the suppression of\ncapillary waves by surfactant is at least partially responsible for the 'footprints of whales' (see Fig. 10.3).\nIn the wake of whales, even in turbulent roiling seas, one seas patches on the sea surface (of characteristic\nwidth 5-10m) that are perfectly flat. These are generally acknowledged to result from the whales sweeping\nbiomaterial to the surface with their tails, this biomaterial serving as a surfactant that suppresses capillary\nwaves.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n10.2. Surfactants\nChapter 10. Marangoni Flows II\nSurfactants and a murder mystery. From Nature, 22, 1880:\n\"In the autumn of 1878 a man committed a terrible crime in Somerset, which was for some time involved\nin deep mystery. His wife, a handsome and decent mulatto woman, disappeared suddenly and entirely from\nsight, after going home from church on Sunday, October 20. Suspicion immediately fell upon the husband,\na clever young fellow of about thirty, but no trace of the missing woman was left behind, and there seemed\na strong probability that the crime would remain undetected. On Sunday, however, October 27, a week\nafter the woman had disappeared, some Somerville boatmen looking out towards the sea, as is their custom,\nwere struck by observing in the Long Bay Channel, the surface of which was ruffled by a slight breeze, a\nstreak of calm such as, to use their own illustration, a cask of oil usually diffuses around it\nwhen in the water. The feverish anxiety about the missing woman suggested some strange connection\nbetween this singular calm and the mode of her disappearance. Two or three days after - why not sooner\nI cannot tell you - her brother and three other men went out to the spot where it was observed, and from\nwhich it had not disappeared since Sunday, and with a series of fish-hooks ranged along a long line dragged\nthe bottom of the channel, but at first without success. Shifting the position of the boat, they dragged a\nlittle further to windward, and presently the line was caught. With water glasses the men discovered that\nit had caught in a skeleton which was held down by some heavy weight. They pulled on the line; something\nsuddenly gave was, and up came the skeleton of the trunk, pelvis, and legs of a human body, from which\nalmost every vestige of flesh had disappeared, but which, from the minute fragments remaining, and the\nterrible stench, had evidently not lain long in the water. The husband was a fisherman, and Long Bay\nChannel was a favourite fishing ground, and he calculated, truly enough, that the fish would very soon\ndestroy all means of identification; but it never entered into his head that as they did so their ravages,\ncombined with the process of decomposition, set free the matter which was to write the traces of\nhis crime on the surface of the water. The case seems to be an exceedingly interesting one; the calm\nis not mentioned in any book on medical jurisprudence that I have, and the doctors seem not to have had\nexperience of such an occurrence. A diver went down and found a stone with a rope attached, by which\nthe body had been held down, and also portions of the scalp and of the skin of the sole of the foot, and of\nclothing, by means of which the body was identified. The husband was found guilty and executed.\"\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\nZ\n10.3. Surfactant-induced Marangoni flows\nChapter 10. Marangoni Flows II\nFigure 10.4: The soap boat. A floating body (length 2.5cm) contains a small volume of soap, which serves\nas its fuel in propelling it across the free surface. The soap exits the rear of the boat, decreasing the local\nsurface tension. The resulting fore-to-aft surface tension gradient propels the boat forward. The water\nsurface is covered with Thymol blue, which parts owing to the presence of soap, which is thus visible as a\nwhite streak.\n10.3\nSurfactant-induced Marangoni flows\n1. Marangoni propulsion\nConsider a floating body with perimeter C in contact with the free surface, which we assume for the sake\nof simplicity to be flat. Recalling that σ may be though of as a force per unit length in a direction tangent\nto the surface, we see that the total surface tension force acting on the body is:\nFc =\nσsdl\n(10.3)\nC\nwhere s is the unit vector tangent to the free surface and normal to C, and dl is an increment of arc\nlength along C. If σ is everywhere constant, then this line integral vanishes identically by the divergence\ntheorem. However, if σ = σ(x), then it may result in a net propulsive force. The 'soap boat' may be\nsimply generated by coating one end of a toothpick with soap, which acts to reduce surface tension (see\nright). The concomitant gradient in surface tension results in a net propulsive force that drives the boat\naway from the soap. We note that an analogous Marangoni propulsion technique arises in the natural\nworld: certain water-walking insects eject surfactant and use the resulting surface tension gradients as\nan emergency mechanism for avoiding predation. Moreover, when a pine needle falls into a lake or pond,\nit is propelled across the surface in an analogous fashion owing to the influence of the resin at its base\ndecreasing the local surface tension.\n2. Soap film stability\nPinching a film increases the surface area, decreases\nΓ and so increases σ. Fluid is thus drawn in and\nthe film is stabilized by the Marangoni elasticity.\nFigure 10.5: Fluid is drawn to a pinched area of a\nsoap film through induced Marangoni stresses.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

Specifically, air bubbles rise at low Reynolds number at\nrates appropriate for rigid spheres with equivalent buoyancy in all but the most carefully cleaned fluids.\nThis discrepancy may be rationalized through consideration of the influence of surfactants on the surface\ndynamics. The flow generated by a clean spherical bubble or radius a rising at low Re = Ua/ν is in\ntuitively obvious. The interior flow is toroidal, while the surface motion is characterized by divergence\nand convergence at, respectively, the leading and trailing surfaces. The presence of surface contamination\nchanges the flow qualitatively.\nThe effective surface elasticity imparted by the surfactants acts to suppress the surface motion. Sur\nfactant is generaly swept to the trailing edge of the bubble, where it accumulates, giving rise to a local\ndecrease in surface tension. The resulting for-to-aft surface tension gradient results in a Marangoni stress\nthat resists surface motion, and so rigidifies the bubble surface. The air bubble thus moves as if its surface\nwere stagnant, and it is thus that its rise speed is commensurate with that predicted for a rigid sphere: the\nno-slip boundary condition is more appropriate than the free-slip. Finally, we note that the characteristic\nMarangoni stress Δσ/a is most pronounced for small bubbles. It is thus that the influence of surfactants\nis greatest on small bubbles.\nFigure 10.7: A rising drop or bubble (left) is marked by internal circulation in a clean system that is\nabsent in a contaminated, surfactant-laden fluid (right). Surfactant sticks to the surface, and the induced\nMarangoni stress rigidifies the drop surface.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n|\n|\n\n11.

It is precisely this\nRayleigh-Plateau instability that is responsible for the pinch-off of thin\nwater jets emerging from kitchen taps (see Fig. 11.2).\nThe equilibrium base state consists of an infinitely long quiescent\ncylindrical inviscid fluid column of radius R0, density ρ and surface\ntension σ (see Fig. 11.3).

For jets falling from a nozzle,\nthe result (11.5) may be used to deduce the local jet speed.\n11.3\nFluid Pipes\nThe following system may be readily observed in a kitchen sink. When the volume flux exiting the tap\nis such that the falling stream has a diameter of 2 - 3mm, obstructing the stream with a finger at a\ndistance of several centimeters from the tap gives rise to a stationary field of varicose capillary waves\nupstream of the finger. If the finger is dipped in liquid detergent (soap) before insertion into the stream,\nthe capillary waves begin at some critical distance above the finger, below which the stream is cylindrical.\nCloser inspection reveal that the surface of the jet's cylindrical base is quiescent.\nAn analogous phenomenon arises when a vertical fluid jet impinges on a deep water reservoir (see\nFig. 11.5).\nWhen the reservoir is contaminated by surfactant, the surface tension of the reservoir is\ndiminished relative to that of the jet. The associated surface tension gradient draws surfactant a finite\ndistance up the jet, prompting two salient alterations in the jet surface. First, the surfactant suppresses\nsurface waves, so that the base of the jet surface assumes a cylindrical form (Fig. 11.5b). Second, the jet\nsurface at its base becomes stagnant: the Marangoni stresses associated with the surfactant gradient are\nbalanced by the viscous stresses generated within the jet. The quiescence of the jet surface may be simply\ndemonstrated by sprinkling a small amount of talc or lycopodium powder onto the jet. The fluid jet thus\nenters a contaminated reservoir as if through a rigid pipe.\nA detailed theoretical description of the fluid pipe is given in Hancock & Bush (JFM, 466, 285-304).\nWe here present a simple scaling that yields the dependence of the vertical extent H of the fluid pipe on\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

M. Bush\n\n13. Fluid Sheets\n13.1\nFluid Sheets: shape and stability\nThe dynamics of high-speed fluid sheets was first considered by Savart (1833) after his early work on\nelectromagnetism with Biot, and was subsequently examined by Rayleigh (1879), then in a series of\npapers by Taylor (Proc. Roy. Soc., 1959 ). They have recently received a great deal of attention owing to\ntheir relevance in a number of spray atomization processes. Such sheets may be generated from a variety\nof source conditions, for example, the collision of jets on rigid impactors, and jet-jet collisions. There\nis generally a curvature force acting on the sheet edge which acts to contain the fluid sheet. For a 2D\n(planar) sheet, the magnitude of this curvature force is given by\nF c =\nσ (∇· n) ndl\n(13.1)\nC\nUsing the first Frenet-Serret equation (Lecture 2, Appendix B),\ndt\n(∇· n) n =\n(13.2)\ndl\nthus yields\ndt\nF c =\nσ\ndl = σ (t1 - t2) = 2σx\n(13.3)\nC\ndl\nThere is thus an effective force per unit length 2σ along the length of the sheet rim acting to contain the\nrim. We now consider how this result may be applied to compute sheet shapes for three distinct cases: i)\na circular sheet, ii) a lenticular sheet with unstable rims, and iii) a lenticular sheet with stable rims.\n\n13.2. Circular Sheet\nChapter 13. Fluid Sheets\nFigure 13.1:\nA circular fluid sheet generated by the impact of a water jet on a circular impactor. The\nimpacting circle has a diameter of 1 cm.\n13.2\nCircular Sheet\nWe consider the geometry considered in Savart's original experiment. A vertical fluid jet strikes a small\nhorizontal circular impactor. If the flow rate is sufficiently high that gravity does not influence the sheet\nshape, the fluid is ejected radially, giving rise to a circular free fluid sheet (Fig. 13.1).\nρU 2D\nFor We =\n> 1000, the circular sheet is subject to the flapping instability.\nWe thus consider\nσ\nUR ∼ 30·10\nU 2\nWe < 1000, for which the sheet is stable. Scaling: Re =\n∼ 3·104 ≫ 1.

Substituting the form (13.5)\nfor h into the force balance (13.4) yields the sheet radius, or so-called Taylor radius:\nρQu\nRT =\n(13.6)\n4πσ\nThe sheet radius increases with source flux and sheet speed, but decreases with surface tension. We note\nthat the fluid proceeds radially to the sheet edge, where it accumulates until going unstable via a modified\nRayleigh-Plateau instability, often referred to as the Rayleigh-Plateau-Savart instability, as it was first\nobserved on a sheet edge by Savart.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

Fluid Sheets\n13.3\nLenticular sheets with unstable rims (Taylor 1960)\nFigure 13.2: A sheet generated by the collision of water jets at left. The fluid streams radially outward in\na thinning sheet; once the fluid reaches the sheet rim, it is ejected radially in the form of droplets. From\nG.I. Taylor (1960).\nWe now consider the non-axisymmetric fluid , such as may be\nformed by the oblique collision of water jets (see Fig. 13.2), a ge\nometry originally considered by Taylor (1960). Fluid is ejected\nradially from the origin into a sheet with flux distribution given\nby Q(θ), so that the volume flux flowing into the sector between\nθ and θ + dθ is Q(θ)dθ. As in the previous case of the circular\nsheet, the sheet rims are unstable, and fluid drops are contin\nuously ejected therefrom.\nThe sheet shape is computed in a\nsimilar manner, but now depends explicitly on the flux distri\nbution within the sheet, Q(θ). The normal force balance on the\nsheet edge now depends on the normal component of the sheet\nspeed, un:\nρu2 (θ)h(θ) = 2σ\n(13.7)\nn\nThe sheet thickness is again prescribed by (13.5), but now Q =\nQ(θ), so the sheet radius R(θ) is given by the Taylor radius\nρu2 Q(θ)\nn\nR(θ) =\n(13.8)\n4πσu\nComputing sheet shapes thus relies on either experimental mea\nsurement or theoretical prediction of the flux distribution Q(θ)\nwithin the sheet.\n13.4\nLenticular sheets with stable rims\nIn a certain region of parameter space,\nspecifically,\nwith\nfluids more viscous than water,\none may encounter fluid sheets with stable rims (see www\nmath.mit.edu/∼bush/bones.html). The force balance describing the sheet shape must change accordingly.\nWhen rims are stable, fluid entering the rim proceeds along the rim. As a result, there is a centripetal\nforce normal to the fluid rim associated with flow along the curved rim that must be considered in order\nto correctly predict the sheet shapes.\nFigure 13.3:\nThe \"Fluid fishbone\"\nformed by the collision of two jets of\na glycerine-water solution.\nBush &\nHasha (2004).\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n13.4. Lenticular sheets with stable rims\nChapter 13. Fluid Sheets\nThe relevant geometry is presented in Fig. 13.4.\nr(θ) is defined to be the distance from the origin\nto the rim centreline, and un(θ) and ut(θ) the nor\nmal and tangential components of the fluid velocity\nin the sheet where it contacts the rim. v(θ) is de\nfined to be the velocity of flow in the rim, R(θ)\nthe rim radius, and Ψ(θ) the angle between the po\nsition vector r and the local tangent to the rim\ncentreline. Finally, rc(θ) is defined to be the ra\ndius of curvature of the rim centreline, and s the\narc length along the rim centreline. The differential\nequations governing the shape of a stable fluid rim\nbounding a fluid sheet may be deduced by consid\neration of conservation of mass in the rim and the\nlocal normal and tangential force balances at the\nrim.\nFor a steady sheet shape, continuity requires\nthat the volume flux from the sheet balance the\ntangential gradient in volume flux along the rim:\n∂ (\n0 = unh -\nvπR2)\n(13.9)\n∂s\nThe normal force balance requires that the curvature force associated with the rim's surface tension\nbalance the force resulting from the normal flow into the rim from the fluid sheet and the centripetal force\nresulting from the flow along the curved rim:\nFigure 13.4: A schematic illustration of a fluid sheet\nbound by stable rims.\nρπR2v\nρu2 h +\n= 2σ\n(13.10)\nn\nrc\nNote that the force balance (13.7) appropriate for sheets with unstable rims is here augmented by the\ncentripetal force. The tangential force balance at the rim requires a balance between tangential gradients\nin tangential momentum flux, tangential gradients in curvature pressure, viscous resistance to stretching\nof the rim, and the tangential momentum flux arriving from the sheet. For most applications involving\nhigh-speed sheets, the Reynolds number characterizing the rim dynamics is sufficiently large that viscous\nresistance may be safely neglected. Moreover, the curvature term ∇· nˆ generally depends on θ; however,\naccurate to O(R/rc), we may use ∇· nˆ = 1/R.

Given a flux distribution, Q(θ), the system may\nbe integrated to deduce the sheet shape.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n13.5. Water Bells\nChapter 13. Fluid Sheets\n13.5\nWater Bells\nAll of the fluid sheets considered thus far have been confined to a plane. In §13.1, we considered circular\nsheets generated from a vertical jet striking a horizontal impactor.\nThe sheet remains planar only if\nthe flow is sufficiently fast that the fluid reaches its Taylor radius before sagging substantially under the\ninfluence of gravity. Decreasing the flow rate will make this sagging more pronounced, and the sheet will\nno longer be planar. While one might expect the sheet to fall along a parabolic trajectory, the toroidal\ncurvature of the bell induces curvature pressures that act to close the sheet. Consequently, the sheet may\nclose upon itself, giving rise to a water bell, as illustrated in Fig. 13.5. A recent review of the dynamics\nof water bells has been written by Clanet (Ann.Rev.). We proceed by outlining the theory required to\ncompute the shapes of water bells.\nWe consider a fluid sheet extruded radially at a speed u0 and subsequently sagging under the influence\nof a gravitational field g = -gzˆ. The inner and outer sheet surfaces are characterized by a constant\nsurface tension σ. The sheet has constant density ρ and thickness t(r, z). Q is the total volume flux in\nthe sheet. The characteristic Re is assumed to be sufficiently high so that the influence of viscosity is\nnegligible.\nWe define the origin to be the center of the impact plate; r and z are, respectively, the radial and\nvertical distances from the origin. u is the sheet speed, and φ the angle made between the sheet and the\nvertical. rc is the local radius of curvature of a meridional line, and s the arc length along a meridional\nline measured from the origin. Finally, ΔP is the pressure difference between the outside and inside of\nthe bell as may be altered experimentally.\nFlux conservation requires that\nQ = 2πrtu\n(13.14)\nwhile Bernoulli's Theorem indicates that\nu = u + 2gz\n(13.15)\nThe total curvature force acting normal to the bell surface\nis given by\n( 1\n)\ncos φ\n2σ∇· n = 2σ\n+\n(13.16)\nrc\nr\nNote that the factor of two results from there being two\nFigure 13.5:\nA water bell produced by the\nfree surfaces.

Contact angle hysteresis, Wetting\nof textured solids\nRecall: In Lecture 3, we defined the equilibrium contact angle θe, which is prescribed by Young's Law:\ncos θe = (γSV - γSL) /γ as deduced from the horizontal force balance at the contact line.\nWork done by a contact line moving a distance dx:\nFigure 15.1: Calculating the work done by moving a contact line a distance dx.\ndW = (γSV - γSL) dx -\nγ cos θedx\n(15.1)\n\ncontact line motion\nfrom creating new interface\nIn equilibrium: dW = 0, which yields Young's Law. It would be convenient if wetting could be simply\ncharacterized in terms of this single number θe. Alas, there is:\n15.1\nContact Angle Hysteresis\nFor a given solid wetting a given liquid, there is a range of possible contact angles: θr < θ < θa, i.e. the\ncontact angle lies between the retreating and advancing contact angles; θr and θa, respectively. That is,\nmany θ values may arise, depending on surface, liquid, roughness and history.\nFilling a drop\nDraining a drop\n- begin with a drop in equilibrium with θ = θe\n- begin with a drop in equilibrium with θ = θe\n- fill drop slowly with a syringe\n- drain drop slowly with a syringe\n- θ increases progressively until attaining θa, at\n- θ decreases progressively until attaining θr, at\nwhich point the contact line advances\nwhich point the contact line retreats\nOrigins: Contact line pinning results from surface heterogeneities (either chemical or textural), that\npresent an energetic impediment to contact line motion.\nThe pinning of a contact line on impurities leads to increased interfacial area, and so is energetically\ncostly. Contact line motion is thus resisted.\nContact Line Pinning at Corners\nA finite range of contact angles can arise at a corner θ1 < θ < π - φ + θ1; thus, an advancing contact line\nwill generally be pinned at corners. Hence surface texture increases contact angle hysteresis.\n\n15.1. Contact Angle Hysteresis\nChapter 15.

Raindrops on window panes (Dussan+Chow 1985)\nIf θ1 = θ2 then the drop will fall due to unbalanced\ngravitational force.\nθ2 can be as large as θa, θ1 as small\nas θr.\nThus, the drop weight may be supported by the\ncapillary force associated with the contact angle hystere\nsis.\nNote: Fg ∼ ρR3g, Fc ∼ 2πRσ(cos θ1 - cos θ2) which implies\nρgR2\nthat\nFG ∼\n≡Bo.\nIn general, drops on a window pane\nFC\nσ\nwill increase in size by accretion until Bo > 1 and will then roll\ndownwards.\n15.2\nWetting of a Rough Surface\nConsider a fluid placed on a rough surface.\nFigure 15.5: A raindrop may be pinned\nDefine: roughness parameters\non a window pane.\nTotal Surface Area\nArea of islands\nr =\n> 1\nφS =\n< 1\n(15.4)\nProjected Surf.

Define: Effective contact angle θ∗ is the contact angle apparent\non a rough solid, which need not correspond to θe. Observation:\nθ∗ < θe when θe < π/2 (hydrophilic)\nθ∗ > θe when θe > π/2 (hydrophobic).\nThe intrinsic hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of a solid, as prescribed by θe, is enhanced by surface\nroughening.\nFigure 15.6:\nA drop wetting a rough solid has an effective contact angle θ∗ that is generally different\nfrom its equilibrium value θe.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

The change in wetting energy associated\nwith a fluid front advancing a distance dx (see Fig. 15.7) is\ndEW = r(γSL - γSV )dx + γ cos θ∗dx\n(15.6)\nIf r = 1 (smooth surface), Young's Law emerges.\nIf r > 1: cos θ∗ = r cos θe\nNote:\n1. wetting tendencies are amplified by roughening,\ne.g. for hydrophobic solid (θe > π/2, cos θe < 0 ⇒ θe ≫\nπ/2 for large r )\n2. for θe < θc (depends on surface texture) ⇒ demi-wicking\n/ complete wetting\n3. Wenzel state breaks down at large r ⇒ air trapped within\nthe surface roughness ⇒ Cassie State\n15.4\nCassie-Baxter State\nIn a Cassie state, the fluid does not impregnate the rough\nsolid, leaving a trapped vapour layer. A fluid placed on\nthe rough surface thus sits on roughness elements (e.g.\npillars or islands), and the change of energy associated\nwith\nits\nfront\nadvancing\na\ndistance\ndx\nis\ndEc = φS (γSL - γSV ) dx + (1 - φS) γdx + γ cos θ∗dx\n(15.7)\nFor equilibrium (dEc/dx = 0), we require:\ncos θ∗ = -1 + φS + φS cos θe\n(15.8)\nNote:\n1. as pillar density φS → 0, cos θ∗ →-1, i.e. θ∗ → π\n2. drops in a Cassie State are said to be in a \"fakir\nstate\".\n3. contact angle hysteresis is greatly increased in the\nWenzel state, decreased in the Cassie.\n4. the maintenance of a Cassie state is key to water\nrepellency.\nCrossover between Wenzel and Cassie states:\n-1+φS\nFor dEW > dEc, we require -r cos θe +cos θ∗ > -φs cos θe +(1-φs)+cos θ∗, i.e. cos θe <\nr-φS = cos θc,\ni.e. one expects a Cassie state to emerge for cos θe > cos θc. Therefore, the criterion for a Wenzel State\ngiving way to a Cassie state is identical to that for spontaneous wicking.\nFigure 15.7:\nThe wetting of a rough solid in\na Wenzel state.\nFigure 15.8:\nThe wetting of a rough solid in\na Cassie-Baxter state.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

Contact angle hysteresis, Wetting of textured solids\nSummary:\nHydrophilic: Wenzel's Law ceases to apply at small θe when demi-wicking sets in, and the Cassie state\nemerges.\nHydrophobic: Discontinuous jump in θ∗ as θe exceeds π/2 ⇒ Cassie state. Jump is the largest for large\nroughness (small φS)\nHistorical note:\n1. early studies of wetting motivated by insecticides\n2. chemists have since been trying to design superhydrophobic (or oliophobic) surfaces using combina\ntions of chemistry and texture\n3. recent advances in microfabrication have achieved θ∗ ∼ π, Δθ ∼ 0 (e.g. Lichen surface McCarthy)\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

More forced wetting\nSome clarification notes on Wetting.\nFigure 16.1: Three different wetting states.\nLast class, we discussed the Cassie state only in the context\nof drops in a Fakir state, i.e. suspended partially on a bed of\nair.\nThere is also a \"wet Cassie\" state.\nMore generally, the\nCassie-Baxter model applies to wetting on a planar but chemi\ncally heterogeneous surfaces.\nConsider a surface with 2 species, one with area fraction f1 and\nequilibrium contact angle θ1, another with area fraction f2 and\nangle θ2. Energy variation associated with the front advancing\na distance dx:\ndE = f1(γSL - γSV )1dx + f2(γSL - γSV )2dx + γ cos θ∗dx.\nThus, dE = 0 when\ncos θ∗ = f1 cos θ1+f2 cos θ2\n(Cassie-Baxter relation) (16.1)\nSpecial Case: in the Fakir state, the two phases are the solid\n(θ1 = θe and f1 = θS) and air (θ2 = π, f2 = 1 - θS) so we have\ncos θ∗ = θS cos θe - 1 + θS\n(16.2)\nas previously.\nAs before, in this hydrophobic case, the Wenzel state is energetically favourable when\ndEW <dEC, i.e. cos θC < cos θe < 0\nwhere cos θC = (θS - 1)/(r - θS), i.e. θE is between π/2 and θC.\nHowever, experiments indicate that even in this regime, air may remain trapped, so that a metastable\nCassie state emerges.\n16.1\nHydrophobic Case: θe > π/2, cos θe < 0\nIn the Fakir state, the two phases are the solid (θ = θe, f1 = φ) and vapour (θ2 = π, f2 = 1 - φs).\nCassie-Baxter:\ncos θ∗ = πS cos θe - 1 + φs\n(16.3)\nas deduced previously. As previously, the Wenzel state is energetically favourable when dEW < dEL, i.e.\nφS -1\ncos θC < cos θe < 0 where cos θC = r-φS . Experiments indicate that even in this region, air may remain\ntrapped, leading to a meta-stable Fakir state.\nFigure 16.2: Wetting of a tiled (chem\nically heterogeneous) surface.\n\n16.2. Hydrophilic Case: θe < π/2\nChapter 16. More forced wetting\nFigure 16.3: Relationship between cos θ∗ and cos θe for different wetting states.\n16.2\nHydrophilic Case: θe < π/2\nHere, the Cassie state corresponds to a tiled surface with 2 phases corresponding to the solid (θ1 = θe,\nf1 = φS) and the fluid (θ2 = 0, f2 = 1 - φS).\nCassie-Baxter ⇒ cos θ∗ = 1 - φS + φS cos θe, which describes a \"Wet Cassie\" state. Energy variation:\ndE = (r - φS)(γSL - γSV )dx + (1 - φS)γdx.\nγSL - γSV\n1 - φS\n⇒ dE = 0 if\ncos θe =\n>\n≡ cos θ∗\n(16.4)\nc\nγ\nr - φS\nFor θe < θc, a film will impregnate the rough solid. Criteria for this transition can also be deduced by\nequating energies in the Cassie and Wenzel states, i.e. r cos θe = 1 - φS + φS cos θe ⇒ θe = θC. Therefore,\nwhen π/2 > θe > θC, the solid remains dry ahead of the drop ⇒ Wenzel applies ⇒ when θe < θC ⇒ film\npenetrates texture and system is described by \"Wet Cassie\" state.\nJohnson + Dettre (1964) examined water drops on wax, whose roughness they varied by baking. They\nshowed an increase and then decrease of Δθ = θa - θr as the roughness increased, and system went from\nsmooth to Wenzel to Cassie states.\nWater-repellency: important for corrosion-resistance, self-cleaning, drag-reducing surfaces. It requires\nthe maintenance of a Cassie State. This means the required impregnation pressure must be exceeded by\nthe curvature pressure induced by roughness.\nE.g.1 Static Drop in a Fakir State\nδ\nThe interface will touch down if δ > h.

However, no equilibrium shape emerges; the lens\nis characterized by periodic fluctuations in radius, and so resembles a beating heart.\nThe phenomenon was first reported by Buetschli (1894), a professor of Zoology at the University of\nHeidelberg, in his treatise Investigations on Protoplasm. It was subsequently described qualitatively by\nSebba (1979, 1981).\nMotivation: \"The ultimate goal of physiologists is to be able to explain living behaviour in terms of\nphysicochemical forces. Thus, any expansion of our knowledge of such forces, based on inanimate systems,\nshould be examined to see whether this might not offer insight into biological behaviour\". Sebba (1979).\nMany biological systems exhibit periodic behaviour; e.g. oscillations of cells of nerves and muscle\ntissue, oscillations in mitochondria, and biological clocks. Conversion of chemical into mechanical energy\nis one of the main processes in biological movements; e.g. chloroplast movements and muscle contraction.\nObservations:\n- lens behaviour is independent of water depth, strongly dependent on surfactant concentration Γ\n- for Γ = 0 no beating - stable sessile lens\n- for moderate Γ steady beating observed\n- for high Γ drop edges become unstable to fingers\n- for highest Γ, lens explodes into a series of smaller beating lenses.\n- beating marked by slow expansion, rapid retraction\n- odour of Tergitol always accompanies beating\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

What sets their size?\nKnowing nothing of surface chemistry, one anticipates that Laplace pressure balances hydrostatic pressure\nJ\nif σ/H ≥ ρgH ⇒ H < lc =\nσ/ρg = capillary length.\nNote:\n1. Drops with R < lc remain heavily spherical\n2. Large drops spread to depth H ∼ lc so that\nLaplace + hydrostatic pressures balance at the\ndrop's edge.\nA volume V will thus spread\nto a radius R s.t.\nπR2lc = V , from which\n1/2\nR = (V/πlc)\n.\n3. This is the case for H2O on most surfaces,\nFigure 3.1: Spreading of drops of increasing size.\nwhere a contact line exists.\nNote: In general, surface chemistry can dominate and one need not have a contact line.\nMore generally, wetting occurs at fluid-solid contact. Two possibilities exist: partial wetting or total\nwetting, depending on the surface energies of the 3 interfaces (γLV , γSV , γSL).\nNow, just as σ = γLV is a surface energy per area or tensile force per length at a liquid-vapour surface,\nγSL and γSV are analogous quantities at solid-liquid and solid-vapour interfaces.\nThe degree of wetting determined by spreading parameters:\nS = [Esubstrate]dry - [Esubstrate]wet = γSV - (γSL + γLV )\n(3.1)\nwhere only γLV can be easily measured.\nTotal Wetting: S > 0 , θe = 0 liquid spreads completely in order to minimize its surface energy. e.g.\nsilicon on glass, water on clean glass.\nNote: Silicon oil is more likely to spread than H2O since σw ∼ 70 dyn/cm > σs.o. ∼ 20 dyn/cm. Final\nresult: a film of nanoscopic thickness resulting from competition between molecular and capillary forces.\nPartial wetting: S < 0, θe > 0. In absence of\ng, forms a spherical cap meeting solid at a con\ntact angle θe. A liquid is \"wetting\" on a particular\nsolid when θe < π/2, non-wetting or weakly wetting\nwhen θe > π/2. For H2O, a surface is hydrophilic\nif θe < π/2, hydrophobic if θe > π/2 and superhy\ndrophobic if θe > 5π/6.\nFigure 3.2: The same water drop on hydrophobic\nand hydrophilic surfaces.\nNote: if g = 0, drops always take the form of a spherical cap ⇒ flattening indicates the effects of gravity.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n357 Interfacial Phenomena\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "10. Marangoni Flows II\n10.1\nTears of Wine\nThe first Marangoni flow considered was the tears of wine phenomenon (Thomson 1885), which actually\npredates Marangoni's first published work on the subject by a decade. The tears of wine phenomenon\nis readily observed in a wine glass following the establishment of a thin layer of wine on the walls of the\nglass.\nAn illustration of the tears of wine phenomenon is shown in Fig. 10.1. Evaporation of alcohol occurs\neverywhere along the free surface. The alcohol concentration in the thin layer is thus reduced relative to\nthat in the bulk owing to the enhanced surface area to volume ratio. As surface tension decreases with\nalcohol concentration, the surface tension is higher in the thin film than the bulk; the associated Marangoni\nstress drives upflow throughout the thin film. The wine climbs until reaching the top of the film, where\nit accumulates in a band of fluid that thickens until eventually becoming gravitationally unstable and\nreleasing the tears of wine. The tears or \"legs\" roll back to replenish the bulk reservoir, but with fluid\nthat is depleted in alcohol.\nThe flow relies on the transfer of chemical potential energy to kinetic and ultimately gravitational\npotential energy. The process continues until the fuel for the process, the alcohol is completely depleted.\nFor certain liquors (e.g. port), the climbing film, a Marangoni shear layer, goes unstable to streamwise\nvortices and an associated radial corrugation - the \"tear ducts of wine\" (Hosoi & Bush, JFM 2001). When\nthe descending tears reach the bath, they appear to recoil in response to the abrupt change in σ. The\ntears or legs of wine are taken by sommeliers to be an indicator of the quality of wine.\nFigure 10.1: The tears of wine. Fluid is drawn from the bulk up the thin film adjoining the walls of the\nglass by Marangoni stresses induced by evaporation of alcohol from the free surface.\n\n10.2. Surfactants\nChapter 10. Marangoni Flows II\nFigure 10.2: a) A typical molecular structure of surfactants. b) The typical dependence of σ on surfactant\nconcentration c.\n10.2\nSurfactants\nSurfactants are molecules that have an affinity for interfaces; common examples include soap and oil.\nOwing to their molecular structure (e.g. a hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail, Fig. 10.2a), they\nfind it energetically favourable to reside at the free surface. Their presence reduces the surface tension;\nconsequently, gradients in surfactant concentration Γ result in surface tension gradients. Surfactants thus\ngenerate a special class of Marangoni flows. There are many different types of surfactants, some of which\nare insoluble (and so remain on the surface), others of which are soluble in the suspending fluid and\nso diffuse into the bulk. For a wide range of common surfactants, surface tension is a monotonically\ndecreasing function of Γ until a critical micell concentration (CMC) is achieved, beyond CMC there is no\nfurther dependence of σ on Γ (Fig. 10.2b).\nSurfactant properties:\n- Diffusivity prescribes the rate of diffusion, Ds (bulk diffusivity Db), of a surfactant along an\ninterface\n- Solubility prescribes the ease with which surfactant passes from the surface to the bulk. An\ninsoluble surfactant cannot dissolve into the bulk, must remain on the surface.\n- Volatility prescribes the ease with which surfactant sublimates.\nTheoretical Approach: because of the dependence of σ on the surfactant concentration, and the ap\npearance of σ in the boundary conditions, N-S equations must be augmented by an equation governing\nthe evolution of Γ. In the bulk,\n∂c\n= Db∇2\n+ u · ∇c\nc\n(10.1)\n∂t\nThe concentration of surfactant Γ on a free surface evolves according to\n∂Γ\n∇2\n+ ∇s · (Γus) + Γ (∇s · n) (u · n) = J (Γ, Cs) + Ds\nΓ\n(10.2)\ns\n∂t\nwhere us is the surface velocity, ∇s is the surface gradient operator and Ds is the surface diffusivity of\nthe surfactant (Stone 1999). J is a surfactant source term associated with adsorption onto or desorption\nfrom the surface, and depends on both the surface surfactant concentration Γ and the concentration in the\nbulk Cs. Tracing the evolution of a contaminated free surface requires the use of Navier-Stokes equations,\nrelevant boundary conditions and the surfactant evolution equation (10.2). The dependence of surface\ntension on surfactant concentration, σ(Γ), requires the coupling of the flow field and surfactant field. In\ncertain special cases, the system may be made more tractable. For example, for insoluble surfactants,\nJ = 0. Many surfactants have sufficiently small Ds that surface diffusivity may be safely neglected.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M.

One can think of a clean interface as a \"slippery trampoline\" that resists\ndeformation through generation of normal curvature pressures. However, such a surface cannot generate\ntraction on the interface. However, a surface-laden interface, like a trampoline, resists surface deformation\nas does a clean interface, but can also support tangential stresses via Marangoni elasticity. Specifically,\nthe presence of surfactants will serve not only to alter the normal stress balance (through the reduction\nof σ), but also the tangential stress balance through the generation of Marangoni stresses.\nThe presence of surfactants will act to suppress any fluid motion characterized by non-zero surface\ndivergence. For example, consider a fluid motion characterized by a radially divergent surface motion.\nThe presence of surfactants results in the redistribution of surfactants: Γ is reduced near the point of\ndivergence. The resulting Marangoni stresses act to suppress the surface motion, resisting it through an\neffective surface elasticity. Similarly, if the flow is characterized by a radial convergence, the resulting\naccumulation of surfactant in the region of convergence will result in Marangoni stresses that serve to\nresist it. It is this effective elasticity that gives soap films their longevity: the divergent motions that\nwould cause a pure liquid film to rupture are suppressed by the surfactant layer on the soap film surface.\nThe ability of surfactant to suppress flows with non-zero surface divergence is evident throughout\nthe natural world. It was first remarked upon by Pliny the Elder, who rationalized that the absence of\ncapillary waves in the wake of ships is due to the ships stirring up surfactant. This phenomenon was also\nwidely known to spear-fishermen, who poured oil on the water to increase their ability to see their prey,\nand by sailors, who would do similarly in an attempt to calm troubled seas. Finally, the suppression of\ncapillary waves by surfactant is at least partially responsible for the 'footprints of whales' (see Fig. 10.3).\nIn the wake of whales, even in turbulent roiling seas, one seas patches on the sea surface (of characteristic\nwidth 5-10m) that are perfectly flat. These are generally acknowledged to result from the whales sweeping\nbiomaterial to the surface with their tails, this biomaterial serving as a surfactant that suppresses capillary\nwaves.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n10.2. Surfactants\nChapter 10. Marangoni Flows II\nSurfactants and a murder mystery. From Nature, 22, 1880:\n\"In the autumn of 1878 a man committed a terrible crime in Somerset, which was for some time involved\nin deep mystery. His wife, a handsome and decent mulatto woman, disappeared suddenly and entirely from\nsight, after going home from church on Sunday, October 20. Suspicion immediately fell upon the husband,\na clever young fellow of about thirty, but no trace of the missing woman was left behind, and there seemed\na strong probability that the crime would remain undetected. On Sunday, however, October 27, a week\nafter the woman had disappeared, some Somerville boatmen looking out towards the sea, as is their custom,\nwere struck by observing in the Long Bay Channel, the surface of which was ruffled by a slight breeze, a\nstreak of calm such as, to use their own illustration, a cask of oil usually diffuses around it\nwhen in the water. The feverish anxiety about the missing woman suggested some strange connection\nbetween this singular calm and the mode of her disappearance. Two or three days after - why not sooner\nI cannot tell you - her brother and three other men went out to the spot where it was observed, and from\nwhich it had not disappeared since Sunday, and with a series of fish-hooks ranged along a long line dragged\nthe bottom of the channel, but at first without success. Shifting the position of the boat, they dragged a\nlittle further to windward, and presently the line was caught. With water glasses the men discovered that\nit had caught in a skeleton which was held down by some heavy weight. They pulled on the line; something\nsuddenly gave was, and up came the skeleton of the trunk, pelvis, and legs of a human body, from which\nalmost every vestige of flesh had disappeared, but which, from the minute fragments remaining, and the\nterrible stench, had evidently not lain long in the water. The husband was a fisherman, and Long Bay\nChannel was a favourite fishing ground, and he calculated, truly enough, that the fish would very soon\ndestroy all means of identification; but it never entered into his head that as they did so their ravages,\ncombined with the process of decomposition, set free the matter which was to write the traces of\nhis crime on the surface of the water. The case seems to be an exceedingly interesting one; the calm\nis not mentioned in any book on medical jurisprudence that I have, and the doctors seem not to have had\nexperience of such an occurrence. A diver went down and found a stone with a rope attached, by which\nthe body had been held down, and also portions of the scalp and of the skin of the sole of the foot, and of\nclothing, by means of which the body was identified. The husband was found guilty and executed.\"\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\nZ\n10.3. Surfactant-induced Marangoni flows\nChapter 10. Marangoni Flows II\nFigure 10.4: The soap boat. A floating body (length 2.5cm) contains a small volume of soap, which serves\nas its fuel in propelling it across the free surface. The soap exits the rear of the boat, decreasing the local\nsurface tension. The resulting fore-to-aft surface tension gradient propels the boat forward. The water\nsurface is covered with Thymol blue, which parts owing to the presence of soap, which is thus visible as a\nwhite streak.\n10.3\nSurfactant-induced Marangoni flows\n1. Marangoni propulsion\nConsider a floating body with perimeter C in contact with the free surface, which we assume for the sake\nof simplicity to be flat. Recalling that σ may be though of as a force per unit length in a direction tangent\nto the surface, we see that the total surface tension force acting on the body is:\nFc =\nσsdl\n(10.3)\nC\nwhere s is the unit vector tangent to the free surface and normal to C, and dl is an increment of arc\nlength along C. If σ is everywhere constant, then this line integral vanishes identically by the divergence\ntheorem. However, if σ = σ(x), then it may result in a net propulsive force. The 'soap boat' may be\nsimply generated by coating one end of a toothpick with soap, which acts to reduce surface tension (see\nright). The concomitant gradient in surface tension results in a net propulsive force that drives the boat\naway from the soap. We note that an analogous Marangoni propulsion technique arises in the natural\nworld: certain water-walking insects eject surfactant and use the resulting surface tension gradients as\nan emergency mechanism for avoiding predation. Moreover, when a pine needle falls into a lake or pond,\nit is propelled across the surface in an analogous fashion owing to the influence of the resin at its base\ndecreasing the local surface tension.\n2. Soap film stability\nPinching a film increases the surface area, decreases\nΓ and so increases σ. Fluid is thus drawn in and\nthe film is stabilized by the Marangoni elasticity.\nFigure 10.5: Fluid is drawn to a pinched area of a\nsoap film through induced Marangoni stresses.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n10.4. Bubble motion\nChapter 10. Marangoni Flows II\n3. Vertical Soap Film\n- Vertical force balance: ρgh(z) = dσ . The weight of a soap\ndz\nfilm is supported by Marangoni stress.\n- Internal dynamics: note that film is dynamic (as are all\nMarangoni flows), if it were static, its max height would\nbe lc. It is constantly drying due to the influence of gravity.\ndσ\ndu\n- On the surface:\n∼ μ\nbalance of Marangoni and vis\ndz\ndx\ncous stresses.\nd2 u\n- Inside: ρg ∼ μ dx2 Gravity-viscous.\nFigure 10.6: The weight of a vertical\nsoap film is supported by Marangoni\n10.4\nBubble motion\nstresses on its surface.\nTheoretical predictions for the rise speed of small drops or bub\nbles do not adequately describe observations. Specifically, air bubbles rise at low Reynolds number at\nrates appropriate for rigid spheres with equivalent buoyancy in all but the most carefully cleaned fluids.\nThis discrepancy may be rationalized through consideration of the influence of surfactants on the surface\ndynamics. The flow generated by a clean spherical bubble or radius a rising at low Re = Ua/ν is in\ntuitively obvious. The interior flow is toroidal, while the surface motion is characterized by divergence\nand convergence at, respectively, the leading and trailing surfaces. The presence of surface contamination\nchanges the flow qualitatively.\nThe effective surface elasticity imparted by the surfactants acts to suppress the surface motion. Sur\nfactant is generaly swept to the trailing edge of the bubble, where it accumulates, giving rise to a local\ndecrease in surface tension. The resulting for-to-aft surface tension gradient results in a Marangoni stress\nthat resists surface motion, and so rigidifies the bubble surface. The air bubble thus moves as if its surface\nwere stagnant, and it is thus that its rise speed is commensurate with that predicted for a rigid sphere: the\nno-slip boundary condition is more appropriate than the free-slip. Finally, we note that the characteristic\nMarangoni stress Δσ/a is most pronounced for small bubbles. It is thus that the influence of surfactants\nis greatest on small bubbles.\nFigure 10.7: A rising drop or bubble (left) is marked by internal circulation in a clean system that is\nabsent in a contaminated, surfactant-laden fluid (right). Surfactant sticks to the surface, and the induced\nMarangoni stress rigidifies the drop surface.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M.

It is precisely this\nRayleigh-Plateau instability that is responsible for the pinch-off of thin\nwater jets emerging from kitchen taps (see Fig. 11.2).\nThe equilibrium base state consists of an infinitely long quiescent\ncylindrical inviscid fluid column of radius R0, density ρ and surface\ntension σ (see Fig. 11.3). The influence of gravity is neglected. The\npressure p0 is constant inside the column and may be calculated by\nbalancing the normal stresses with surface tension at the boundary.\nAssuming zero external pressure yields\nσ\np0 = σ∇· n ⇒ p0 =\n.\n(11.11)\nR0\nWe consider the evolution of infinitesimal varicose perturbations on\nthe interface, which enables us to linearize the governing equations.\nThe perturbed columnar surface takes the form:\n\nR0 + oeωt+ikz\nR =\n,\n(11.12)\nwhere the perturbation amplitude o ≪ R0, ω is the growth rate of\nthe instability and k is the wave number of the disturbance in the z-\ndirection.

The wavelength is determined by the requirement that the\nwave speed correspond to the local jet speed: U = -ω/k.

For jets falling from a nozzle,\nthe result (11.5) may be used to deduce the local jet speed.\n11.3\nFluid Pipes\nThe following system may be readily observed in a kitchen sink. When the volume flux exiting the tap\nis such that the falling stream has a diameter of 2 - 3mm, obstructing the stream with a finger at a\ndistance of several centimeters from the tap gives rise to a stationary field of varicose capillary waves\nupstream of the finger. If the finger is dipped in liquid detergent (soap) before insertion into the stream,\nthe capillary waves begin at some critical distance above the finger, below which the stream is cylindrical.\nCloser inspection reveal that the surface of the jet's cylindrical base is quiescent.\nAn analogous phenomenon arises when a vertical fluid jet impinges on a deep water reservoir (see\nFig. 11.5).\nWhen the reservoir is contaminated by surfactant, the surface tension of the reservoir is\ndiminished relative to that of the jet. The associated surface tension gradient draws surfactant a finite\ndistance up the jet, prompting two salient alterations in the jet surface. First, the surfactant suppresses\nsurface waves, so that the base of the jet surface assumes a cylindrical form (Fig. 11.5b). Second, the jet\nsurface at its base becomes stagnant: the Marangoni stresses associated with the surfactant gradient are\nbalanced by the viscous stresses generated within the jet. The quiescence of the jet surface may be simply\ndemonstrated by sprinkling a small amount of talc or lycopodium powder onto the jet. The fluid jet thus\nenters a contaminated reservoir as if through a rigid pipe.\nA detailed theoretical description of the fluid pipe is given in Hancock & Bush (JFM, 466, 285-304).\nWe here present a simple scaling that yields the dependence of the vertical extent H of the fluid pipe on\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

      "content": "13. Fluid Sheets\n13.1\nFluid Sheets: shape and stability\nThe dynamics of high-speed fluid sheets was first considered by Savart (1833) after his early work on\nelectromagnetism with Biot, and was subsequently examined by Rayleigh (1879), then in a series of\npapers by Taylor (Proc. Roy. Soc., 1959 ). They have recently received a great deal of attention owing to\ntheir relevance in a number of spray atomization processes. Such sheets may be generated from a variety\nof source conditions, for example, the collision of jets on rigid impactors, and jet-jet collisions. There\nis generally a curvature force acting on the sheet edge which acts to contain the fluid sheet. For a 2D\n(planar) sheet, the magnitude of this curvature force is given by\nF c =\nσ (∇· n) ndl\n(13.1)\nC\nUsing the first Frenet-Serret equation (Lecture 2, Appendix B),\ndt\n(∇· n) n =\n(13.2)\ndl\nthus yields\ndt\nF c =\nσ\ndl = σ (t1 - t2) = 2σx\n(13.3)\nC\ndl\nThere is thus an effective force per unit length 2σ along the length of the sheet rim acting to contain the\nrim. We now consider how this result may be applied to compute sheet shapes for three distinct cases: i)\na circular sheet, ii) a lenticular sheet with unstable rims, and iii) a lenticular sheet with stable rims.\n\n13.2. Circular Sheet\nChapter 13. Fluid Sheets\nFigure 13.1:\nA circular fluid sheet generated by the impact of a water jet on a circular impactor. The\nimpacting circle has a diameter of 1 cm.\n13.2\nCircular Sheet\nWe consider the geometry considered in Savart's original experiment. A vertical fluid jet strikes a small\nhorizontal circular impactor. If the flow rate is sufficiently high that gravity does not influence the sheet\nshape, the fluid is ejected radially, giving rise to a circular free fluid sheet (Fig. 13.1).\nρU 2D\nFor We =\n> 1000, the circular sheet is subject to the flapping instability.\nWe thus consider\nσ\nUR ∼ 30·10\nU 2\nWe < 1000, for which the sheet is stable. Scaling: Re =\n∼ 3·104 ≫ 1.

Substituting the form (13.5)\nfor h into the force balance (13.4) yields the sheet radius, or so-called Taylor radius:\nρQu\nRT =\n(13.6)\n4πσ\nThe sheet radius increases with source flux and sheet speed, but decreases with surface tension. We note\nthat the fluid proceeds radially to the sheet edge, where it accumulates until going unstable via a modified\nRayleigh-Plateau instability, often referred to as the Rayleigh-Plateau-Savart instability, as it was first\nobserved on a sheet edge by Savart.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

Fluid Sheets\n13.3\nLenticular sheets with unstable rims (Taylor 1960)\nFigure 13.2: A sheet generated by the collision of water jets at left. The fluid streams radially outward in\na thinning sheet; once the fluid reaches the sheet rim, it is ejected radially in the form of droplets. From\nG.I. Taylor (1960).\nWe now consider the non-axisymmetric fluid , such as may be\nformed by the oblique collision of water jets (see Fig. 13.2), a ge\nometry originally considered by Taylor (1960). Fluid is ejected\nradially from the origin into a sheet with flux distribution given\nby Q(θ), so that the volume flux flowing into the sector between\nθ and θ + dθ is Q(θ)dθ. As in the previous case of the circular\nsheet, the sheet rims are unstable, and fluid drops are contin\nuously ejected therefrom.\nThe sheet shape is computed in a\nsimilar manner, but now depends explicitly on the flux distri\nbution within the sheet, Q(θ). The normal force balance on the\nsheet edge now depends on the normal component of the sheet\nspeed, un:\nρu2 (θ)h(θ) = 2σ\n(13.7)\nn\nThe sheet thickness is again prescribed by (13.5), but now Q =\nQ(θ), so the sheet radius R(θ) is given by the Taylor radius\nρu2 Q(θ)\nn\nR(θ) =\n(13.8)\n4πσu\nComputing sheet shapes thus relies on either experimental mea\nsurement or theoretical prediction of the flux distribution Q(θ)\nwithin the sheet.\n13.4\nLenticular sheets with stable rims\nIn a certain region of parameter space,\nspecifically,\nwith\nfluids more viscous than water,\none may encounter fluid sheets with stable rims (see www\nmath.mit.edu/∼bush/bones.html). The force balance describing the sheet shape must change accordingly.\nWhen rims are stable, fluid entering the rim proceeds along the rim. As a result, there is a centripetal\nforce normal to the fluid rim associated with flow along the curved rim that must be considered in order\nto correctly predict the sheet shapes.\nFigure 13.3:\nThe \"Fluid fishbone\"\nformed by the collision of two jets of\na glycerine-water solution.\nBush &\nHasha (2004).\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n13.4. Lenticular sheets with stable rims\nChapter 13. Fluid Sheets\nThe relevant geometry is presented in Fig. 13.4.\nr(θ) is defined to be the distance from the origin\nto the rim centreline, and un(θ) and ut(θ) the nor\nmal and tangential components of the fluid velocity\nin the sheet where it contacts the rim. v(θ) is de\nfined to be the velocity of flow in the rim, R(θ)\nthe rim radius, and Ψ(θ) the angle between the po\nsition vector r and the local tangent to the rim\ncentreline. Finally, rc(θ) is defined to be the ra\ndius of curvature of the rim centreline, and s the\narc length along the rim centreline. The differential\nequations governing the shape of a stable fluid rim\nbounding a fluid sheet may be deduced by consid\neration of conservation of mass in the rim and the\nlocal normal and tangential force balances at the\nrim.\nFor a steady sheet shape, continuity requires\nthat the volume flux from the sheet balance the\ntangential gradient in volume flux along the rim:\n∂ (\n0 = unh -\nvπR2)\n(13.9)\n∂s\nThe normal force balance requires that the curvature force associated with the rim's surface tension\nbalance the force resulting from the normal flow into the rim from the fluid sheet and the centripetal force\nresulting from the flow along the curved rim:\nFigure 13.4: A schematic illustration of a fluid sheet\nbound by stable rims.\nρπR2v\nρu2 h +\n= 2σ\n(13.10)\nn\nrc\nNote that the force balance (13.7) appropriate for sheets with unstable rims is here augmented by the\ncentripetal force. The tangential force balance at the rim requires a balance between tangential gradients\nin tangential momentum flux, tangential gradients in curvature pressure, viscous resistance to stretching\nof the rim, and the tangential momentum flux arriving from the sheet. For most applications involving\nhigh-speed sheets, the Reynolds number characterizing the rim dynamics is sufficiently large that viscous\nresistance may be safely neglected. Moreover, the curvature term ∇· nˆ generally depends on θ; however,\naccurate to O(R/rc), we may use ∇· nˆ = 1/R. One thus obtains:\n∂ (\n2)\nπR2σ ∂ ( 1 )\nπR2 v\n= hutun -\n.\n(13.11)\n∂s\nρ\n∂s\nR\nEquations (13.9)-(13.11) must be supplemented by the continuity relation,\nQ(θ)\nh(r, θ) =\n(13.12)\nu0r\nin addition to a number of relations that follow directly from the system geometry:\nsin Ψ ( ∂Ψ\n)\nun = u0 sin Ψ\n,\nuT = u0 cos Ψ\n,\n=\n+ 1\n(13.13)\nrc\nr\n∂θ\nThe system of equations (13.9-13.13) may be nondimensionalized, and reduce to a set of coupled ordinary\nequations in the four variables r(θ), v(θ), R(θ) and Ψ(θ). Given a flux distribution, Q(θ), the system may\nbe integrated to deduce the sheet shape.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n13.5. Water Bells\nChapter 13. Fluid Sheets\n13.5\nWater Bells\nAll of the fluid sheets considered thus far have been confined to a plane. In §13.1, we considered circular\nsheets generated from a vertical jet striking a horizontal impactor.\nThe sheet remains planar only if\nthe flow is sufficiently fast that the fluid reaches its Taylor radius before sagging substantially under the\ninfluence of gravity. Decreasing the flow rate will make this sagging more pronounced, and the sheet will\nno longer be planar. While one might expect the sheet to fall along a parabolic trajectory, the toroidal\ncurvature of the bell induces curvature pressures that act to close the sheet. Consequently, the sheet may\nclose upon itself, giving rise to a water bell, as illustrated in Fig. 13.5. A recent review of the dynamics\nof water bells has been written by Clanet (Ann.Rev.). We proceed by outlining the theory required to\ncompute the shapes of water bells.\nWe consider a fluid sheet extruded radially at a speed u0 and subsequently sagging under the influence\nof a gravitational field g = -gzˆ. The inner and outer sheet surfaces are characterized by a constant\nsurface tension σ. The sheet has constant density ρ and thickness t(r, z). Q is the total volume flux in\nthe sheet. The characteristic Re is assumed to be sufficiently high so that the influence of viscosity is\nnegligible.\nWe define the origin to be the center of the impact plate; r and z are, respectively, the radial and\nvertical distances from the origin. u is the sheet speed, and φ the angle made between the sheet and the\nvertical. rc is the local radius of curvature of a meridional line, and s the arc length along a meridional\nline measured from the origin. Finally, ΔP is the pressure difference between the outside and inside of\nthe bell as may be altered experimentally.\nFlux conservation requires that\nQ = 2πrtu\n(13.14)\nwhile Bernoulli's Theorem indicates that\nu = u + 2gz\n(13.15)\nThe total curvature force acting normal to the bell surface\nis given by\n( 1\n)\ncos φ\n2σ∇· n = 2σ\n+\n(13.16)\nrc\nr\nNote that the factor of two results from there being two\nFigure 13.5:\nA water bell produced by the\nfree surfaces.

Contact angle hysteresis, Wetting\nof textured solids\nRecall: In Lecture 3, we defined the equilibrium contact angle θe, which is prescribed by Young's Law:\ncos θe = (γSV - γSL) /γ as deduced from the horizontal force balance at the contact line.\nWork done by a contact line moving a distance dx:\nFigure 15.1: Calculating the work done by moving a contact line a distance dx.\ndW = (γSV - γSL) dx -\nγ cos θedx\n(15.1)\n\ncontact line motion\nfrom creating new interface\nIn equilibrium: dW = 0, which yields Young's Law. It would be convenient if wetting could be simply\ncharacterized in terms of this single number θe. Alas, there is:\n15.1\nContact Angle Hysteresis\nFor a given solid wetting a given liquid, there is a range of possible contact angles: θr < θ < θa, i.e. the\ncontact angle lies between the retreating and advancing contact angles; θr and θa, respectively. That is,\nmany θ values may arise, depending on surface, liquid, roughness and history.\nFilling a drop\nDraining a drop\n- begin with a drop in equilibrium with θ = θe\n- begin with a drop in equilibrium with θ = θe\n- fill drop slowly with a syringe\n- drain drop slowly with a syringe\n- θ increases progressively until attaining θa, at\n- θ decreases progressively until attaining θr, at\nwhich point the contact line advances\nwhich point the contact line retreats\nOrigins: Contact line pinning results from surface heterogeneities (either chemical or textural), that\npresent an energetic impediment to contact line motion.\nThe pinning of a contact line on impurities leads to increased interfacial area, and so is energetically\ncostly. Contact line motion is thus resisted.\nContact Line Pinning at Corners\nA finite range of contact angles can arise at a corner θ1 < θ < π - φ + θ1; thus, an advancing contact line\nwill generally be pinned at corners. Hence surface texture increases contact angle hysteresis.\n\n15.1. Contact Angle Hysteresis\nChapter 15. Contact angle hysteresis, Wetting of textured solids\nFigure 15.2: Pinning of a contact line retreating from left to right due to surface impurities.\nFigure 15.3: A range of contact angles is possible at a corner.\nManifestations of Contact Angle Hysteresis\nI.

Raindrops on window panes (Dussan+Chow 1985)\nIf θ1 = θ2 then the drop will fall due to unbalanced\ngravitational force.\nθ2 can be as large as θa, θ1 as small\nas θr.\nThus, the drop weight may be supported by the\ncapillary force associated with the contact angle hystere\nsis.\nNote: Fg ∼ ρR3g, Fc ∼ 2πRσ(cos θ1 - cos θ2) which implies\nρgR2\nthat\nFG ∼\n≡Bo.\nIn general, drops on a window pane\nFC\nσ\nwill increase in size by accretion until Bo > 1 and will then roll\ndownwards.\n15.2\nWetting of a Rough Surface\nConsider a fluid placed on a rough surface.\nFigure 15.5: A raindrop may be pinned\nDefine: roughness parameters\non a window pane.\nTotal Surface Area\nArea of islands\nr =\n> 1\nφS =\n< 1\n(15.4)\nProjected Surf.

Define: Effective contact angle θ∗ is the contact angle apparent\non a rough solid, which need not correspond to θe. Observation:\nθ∗ < θe when θe < π/2 (hydrophilic)\nθ∗ > θe when θe > π/2 (hydrophobic).\nThe intrinsic hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of a solid, as prescribed by θe, is enhanced by surface\nroughening.\nFigure 15.6:\nA drop wetting a rough solid has an effective contact angle θ∗ that is generally different\nfrom its equilibrium value θe.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W. M. Bush\n\n15.3. Wenzel State (1936)\nChapter 15. Contact angle hysteresis, Wetting of textured solids\n15.3\nWenzel State (1936)\nA Wenzel state arises when the fluid impregnates the rough solid. The change in wetting energy associated\nwith a fluid front advancing a distance dx (see Fig. 15.7) is\ndEW = r(γSL - γSV )dx + γ cos θ∗dx\n(15.6)\nIf r = 1 (smooth surface), Young's Law emerges.\nIf r > 1: cos θ∗ = r cos θe\nNote:\n1. wetting tendencies are amplified by roughening,\ne.g. for hydrophobic solid (θe > π/2, cos θe < 0 ⇒ θe ≫\nπ/2 for large r )\n2. for θe < θc (depends on surface texture) ⇒ demi-wicking\n/ complete wetting\n3. Wenzel state breaks down at large r ⇒ air trapped within\nthe surface roughness ⇒ Cassie State\n15.4\nCassie-Baxter State\nIn a Cassie state, the fluid does not impregnate the rough\nsolid, leaving a trapped vapour layer. A fluid placed on\nthe rough surface thus sits on roughness elements (e.g.\npillars or islands), and the change of energy associated\nwith\nits\nfront\nadvancing\na\ndistance\ndx\nis\ndEc = φS (γSL - γSV ) dx + (1 - φS) γdx + γ cos θ∗dx\n(15.7)\nFor equilibrium (dEc/dx = 0), we require:\ncos θ∗ = -1 + φS + φS cos θe\n(15.8)\nNote:\n1. as pillar density φS → 0, cos θ∗ →-1, i.e. θ∗ → π\n2. drops in a Cassie State are said to be in a \"fakir\nstate\".\n3. contact angle hysteresis is greatly increased in the\nWenzel state, decreased in the Cassie.\n4. the maintenance of a Cassie state is key to water\nrepellency.\nCrossover between Wenzel and Cassie states:\n-1+φS\nFor dEW > dEc, we require -r cos θe +cos θ∗ > -φs cos θe +(1-φs)+cos θ∗, i.e. cos θe <\nr-φS = cos θc,\ni.e. one expects a Cassie state to emerge for cos θe > cos θc. Therefore, the criterion for a Wenzel State\ngiving way to a Cassie state is identical to that for spontaneous wicking.\nFigure 15.7:\nThe wetting of a rough solid in\na Wenzel state.\nFigure 15.8:\nThe wetting of a rough solid in\na Cassie-Baxter state.\nMIT OCW: 18.357 Interfacial Phenomena\nProf. John W.

Energy variation associated with the front advancing\na distance dx:\ndE = f1(γSL - γSV )1dx + f2(γSL - γSV )2dx + γ cos θ∗dx.\nThus, dE = 0 when\ncos θ∗ = f1 cos θ1+f2 cos θ2\n(Cassie-Baxter relation) (16.1)\nSpecial Case: in the Fakir state, the two phases are the solid\n(θ1 = θe and f1 = θS) and air (θ2 = π, f2 = 1 - θS) so we have\ncos θ∗ = θS cos θe - 1 + θS\n(16.2)\nas previously.\nAs before, in this hydrophobic case, the Wenzel state is energetically favourable when\ndEW <dEC, i.e. cos θC < cos θe < 0\nwhere cos θC = (θS - 1)/(r - θS), i.e. θE is between π/2 and θC.\nHowever, experiments indicate that even in this regime, air may remain trapped, so that a metastable\nCassie state emerges.\n16.1\nHydrophobic Case: θe > π/2, cos θe < 0\nIn the Fakir state, the two phases are the solid (θ = θe, f1 = φ) and vapour (θ2 = π, f2 = 1 - φs).\nCassie-Baxter:\ncos θ∗ = πS cos θe - 1 + φs\n(16.3)\nas deduced previously. As previously, the Wenzel state is energetically favourable when dEW < dEL, i.e.\nφS -1\ncos θC < cos θe < 0 where cos θC = r-φS . Experiments indicate that even in this region, air may remain\ntrapped, leading to a meta-stable Fakir state.\nFigure 16.2: Wetting of a tiled (chem\nically heterogeneous) surface.\n\n16.2. Hydrophilic Case: θe < π/2\nChapter 16. More forced wetting\nFigure 16.3: Relationship between cos θ∗ and cos θe for different wetting states.\n16.2\nHydrophilic Case: θe < π/2\nHere, the Cassie state corresponds to a tiled surface with 2 phases corresponding to the solid (θ1 = θe,\nf1 = φS) and the fluid (θ2 = 0, f2 = 1 - φS).\nCassie-Baxter ⇒ cos θ∗ = 1 - φS + φS cos θe, which describes a \"Wet Cassie\" state.

Criteria for this transition can also be deduced by\nequating energies in the Cassie and Wenzel states, i.e. r cos θe = 1 - φS + φS cos θe ⇒ θe = θC. Therefore,\nwhen π/2 > θe > θC, the solid remains dry ahead of the drop ⇒ Wenzel applies ⇒ when θe < θC ⇒ film\npenetrates texture and system is described by \"Wet Cassie\" state.\nJohnson + Dettre (1964) examined water drops on wax, whose roughness they varied by baking. They\nshowed an increase and then decrease of Δθ = θa - θr as the roughness increased, and system went from\nsmooth to Wenzel to Cassie states.\nWater-repellency: important for corrosion-resistance, self-cleaning, drag-reducing surfaces. It requires\nthe maintenance of a Cassie State. This means the required impregnation pressure must be exceeded by\nthe curvature pressure induced by roughness.\nE.g.1 Static Drop in a Fakir State\nδ\nThe interface will touch down if δ > h.
