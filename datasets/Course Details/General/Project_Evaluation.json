In the United States, most power plants use fossil fuels to generate electricity, despite the\navailability of nuclear power plants that are much cleaner and require no fossil fuel. Most\nintercity transport involves automobiles and airplanes, despite the availability of more\nenergy-efficient rail and bus services. Nuclear power plants, which have experienced no\nfatal accidents in the United States, are feared as too risky whereas automobiles, which in\nfact cause 30,000 or more fatalities per year, are viewed as essential. Discuss some of the\nways that public policy, technological development, and public perceptions of risk have\ninfluenced or could influence the extent to which the United States depends upon\nimported fossil fuels for generating electricity and for transportation. What kinds of\nprojects would you advocate for reducing our dependence upon imported fossil fuels? In\ngeneral terms, how might you evaluate these project?\n(20% of assignment)\n\n(Problem 4.1)\n2. Identify the major economic, environmental, and social impacts likely to be associated\nwith one the following projects:\na. Construction of a superhighway through an urban area\nb. Construction of a major dam that is intended to control flooding, generate\nelectricity, and provide irrigation to the surrounding region\nc. Construction of a nuclear power plant near the coast in a region that depends\nheavily on tourism and ocean-based recreation (Once the nuclear plant is\noperating, a nearby coal-fired power plant will be closed.)\nd. Construction of a wind farm along a ridge in the rural part of a region that is noted\nfor two things: its beauty and its poverty\n(15% of assignment)\nChapter 5 (Martland)\n(Problem 5.7)\n3. Consider a proposed project in which an initial investment of $100 million would\nproduce an annual financial benefit of $3 million. The project is intended to improve\nwater quality and increase the efficiency of the water delivery system in the region. The\nfinancial benefits relate to two factors: There would be less leakage in the pipes used to\ntransport water to the city from the reservoir. The proposed treatment program would be\nmore efficient. The life of the project is expected to be 100 years. Two-thirds of\ninvestment is related to replacing the pipes to eliminate the leakage, while the rest is\nrelated to upgrading the treatment facility. The project would be financed either by\nselling bonds or borrowing money from a local bank; either way, the annual interest rate\nwould be about 4-5%. A hearing has been scheduled for the project, and several speakers\nhave been asked to present their viewpoints. What is the main point that you expect each\nof the following people to make at the hearing?\na. A banker whose bank has made many loans to the city to finance a variety of\nprojects (The banker is known to prefer projects whose financial benefits are\nsufficient to cover the financial costs of the investment.)\nb. An environmental advocate who recently wrote an article entitled Discounting Is\nUnethical--We Must Not Overlook Benefits to Future Generations.''\nc. A doctor who believes that the new water treatment system will lead to a\nmeasurable improvement in health for the region\nd. A farmer whose crops depend upon a reliable supply of water\n\ne. A politician who is in the midst of an election campaign; his slogan is It's high\ntime for low taxes.''\nf. His opponent, whose slogan is Build now for our children and for their\nchildren.''\ng. A civil engineer at the local university who recently completed a study of the\nwater supply system (Among the results of the study was a finding that two major\nleaks caused 80% of the loss of water; these leaks could be fixed for less than $5\nmillion, and the rest of the system should continue in reasonable condition for\nanother 20-30 years.)\nh. The chair of a citizen's advisory committee that advises the mayor on all major\ninfrastructure projects that involve use of taxes to cover operations or investment\n(This group used the federally recommended discount rate of 7% to determine\nthat the benefits of $3 million per year over the life of the project would have a\npresent value of more than $40 million.)\ni. Finally, since you are related to the mayor and you are known to be an excellent\nstudent with an interest in infrastructure, you have been asked to listen to all of\nthe previous speakers and summarize what you feel should be done.\n(20% of assignment)\n(Problem 5.12)\n4. There are four options for building a new road that would shorten the distance between\ntwo cities, reduce congestion on existing roads, and improve safety by diverting traffic\nfrom a narrow road with many dangerous curves. A committee has been formed to select\nthe best option, and they are reviewing the results of analyses as presented in the\nfollowing table. Explain how you would create a single measure that encompasses all of\nthese criteria.\n(15 % of assignment)\n\nMacro-engineering\n5. China now has the second largest GDP in the world, behind only the U.S and is growing\nat 9% annually (although on the measure of GDP per capita, they trail many other\ncountries). China has a huge geographical scale as well. For centuries, China has\n―thought big‖. In ancient times, they built the Great Wall and today they are building a\nvast network of high-speed trains at a dramatically rapid rate and the Three Gorges Dam,\na project of huge scale.\nWe asked you to read Chapter 2 of Macro-Engineering: Global Infrastructure Solutions.\nThe second part of that chapter is entitled A Medieval Chinese Macro-Engineer, Liu An--\nHis Way of Reconstructing the Grand Canal in the Eighth Century and describes an\nmacro-engineering project of substantial scale and national importance in China thirteen\ncenturies ago.\nWe also attach a short recent news article (January 24, 2011) entitled China to create\nlargest mega city in the world with 42 million people. This article discusses a plan to\n―merge together the nine cities that lie around the Pearl River Delta‖ You can google\nPearl River Delta to set this area geographically. The article also mentions several other\nmega city projects in China even more ambitious in scale.\nNow obviously, the Grand Canal and the Pearl River mega city are different in many\nways. As you would expect, the technologies and structure of these projects are not alike\nand they exist in different political structures. Yet, these projects are alike as well from\nthe viewpoint of the motivation for building them (in the modern case, possibly building\nthem), their goals and objectives, the barriers to success they face (or faced) and others\nyou may think of.\na) Please write a 500-word essay discussing the ways in which these projects are alike\nand what lessons the contemporary project could take from the Grand Canal project.\nb) Comment in 500-words on China's strategy of creating mega cities. How would you\nuse the principles of project evaluation to decide whether this is a wise strategy?\n(30% of assignment)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.011 Project Evaluation\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Test your spreadsheet:\na. Salvage value: You are involved with a project that is expected to last 50 years and\nhave a salvage value of $10 million. A consultant has advised your company that an\nexpenditure of only $100,000 at the end of every 5 years will double the salvage\nvalue.

Having won the lottery (as described in Question 6), your only (financial) problem now is\nthat you are just 20 years old and expect to live (in grand style) for well over 30 years. How\nmuch of your first year's installment would you have to invest in order to ensure that you\ncould earn $500,000 per year for another 30 years after the Mass Millions bonanza comes to\nan end?

You\nthink that it will take 30 months to build and that construction costs will be $2 million per\nmonth.You expect tolls to be $10 million per year once the bridge opens, which will be offset\nby toll collection and maintenance costs of $2 million per year. Your MARR is 15% per year.\nTo bid on the project, you specify the price you are willing to pay to the state (in cash, at time\n0) for the right to build the bridge and operate it for a period of 30 years. At the end of 30\nyears, the ownership and operation of the bridge revert to the state.\na. You can obtain a construction line of credit at 10% per year that can be used to cover\nall the construction expenses plus all of the accrued interest. What will be the\noutstanding balance when the bridge is completed?\nb. Once the bridge is open, you will have a steady stream of income, so that you can\nrefinance the construction loan at a lower interest rate, say 8% per year, and pay off\nthe loan in 30 years. What will the annual payments be on this loan?\nc. What is the cash flow (toll revenue minus payments on your loan) from operating the\nbridge worth to you at the end of month 30 when the bridge opens?\nd.

Mortgage Crisis--the Home Buyer: A bank has a policy that it will approve a mortgage for\nsomeone only if they have a steady income that is sufficient to cover the costs of home\nownership. In addition to monthly payments of interest and principal, the bank requires the\nhomeowner to make monthly payments into an escrow account that the bank will used to pay\nproperty taxes, property insurance, and mortgage insurance. The bank requires this\narrangement so that it can be certain that the property taxes are in fact paid on time, that the\nproperty is insured in the case of fire or other disaster, and that the mortgage payments will\nbe made even if the homeowner dies. The bank uses two common rules of thumb in\nreviewing mortgage applications. First, the buyer should make a down payment of at least\n20% of the cost of house (and homeowners are not allowed to borrow this money from\nsomeone else--they must be able to produce the cash from their own resources). Second, the\nsum of the mortgage payment plus the escrow payment should be no more than 30% of the\nhomeowner's income.\n\na. Consider a family with annual income of $60,000. Will they be able to obtain a 6%,\n30-year mortgage for a house that costs $100,000, has property taxes of $3,000 per\nyear, and will cost $1,200 per year for property insurance and mortgage insurance?\nb. The couple decides they would like a bigger house. What is the largest amount that\nthe bank would be willing to lend this family for purchasing a house with taxes and\ninsurance that total $4,200 per year?\nc. The family goes ahead and buys a bigger house for $300,000, and they take out a\n$200,000 mortgage at 6% for 30 years. After 10 years, they decide to move to\nCalifornia in order to get high-paying, high-tech IT jobs. If property values have risen\n11% per year, how much will they be able to gain from the sale of their house?\nAssume that closing costs such as the real estate agent's fee will be 5% of the sale\nprice. Also assume that a portion of the proceeds from the sale will be used to pay off\na total of $300,000, consisting of the remaining portion of their original mortgage\nplus the outstanding balance on their home equity loan.\nd. When they reach California, the family finds that the housing market is much more\nexpensive than they expected, but they have all that money from the sale of their\nprevious house, and they now make $300,000 per year. They conclude that they really\nare rich, so they should buy the best house they can afford, maybe something with a\nview of the mountains. If they are willing to put all of their profits from the sale of\ntheir previous house into their new house, how much will they be able to afford to\npay per year for mortgage and escrow payments?\ne. Unfortunately, what the bank offers is not enough for them to purchase the $4 million\nhouse of their dreams, which has $30,000 per year for taxes and insurance. So they\ndecide to go to a mortgage company. What they would like is a mortgage with only a\n10% down payment, so that they could afford their dream house (and, it must be\nadded, they decided to include their expected bonuses of $41,000 and $72,000) in\ntheir application, stating their income as $413,000 per year, even though they knew\nthey were unlikely to get such good bonuses again.) They were not concerned about\nstretching to make ends meet, and the agent noted that the old 30% limit had been\nincreased to 35%, reflecting the fact that housing prices were rising faster in\nCalifornia than anywhere else in the country. The agent and the couple agreed that\neven if things were tight for a couple of years, housing prices would rise, their\nsalaries would rise, and they would be able to refinance their mortgage for an even\nlarger amount. The agent for the mortgage company agreed to provide the mortgage\nunder the suggested terms, and they bought their dream house. And, it turns out, the\nagent quietly rounded off their income to $450,000 per year when he forwarded their\nmortgage application to his home office for approval. Assuming the company\n\nrequired a 10% down payment and limited mortgage plus escrow to 35% of what was\nreported to be their income, how much would they be able to borrow?\nf. Unfortunately for our intrepid IT experts, they happened to buy their dream house at\nthe top of the market. Three years later, housing prices had dropped by 25%. And\nthen their company went through a massive restructuring, and both of them lost their\njobs, along with a great many others in the region. Their only option was to sell the\nhouse at a loss, move back to the east, and take up their old jobs at a huge cut in pay.\nApproximately how much will they lose?\n(32% of assignment)\nChapter 9 (Martland)\n(Problem 9.9)\n7. You are a summer intern working for a hot-shot project evaluation firm, and your supervisor\nadmits to having a problem. At first he thought his project was really a terrible idea because\nit had only a 2% IRR; but then he discovered that it also had an IRR of 18%, which is well\nabove the firm's hurdle rate of 10%. He checked his numbers, and the calculations (shown\nbelow) were in fact correct. He also did a few side calculations using the firm's hurdle rate of\n10% (also shown below). Explain the problem, complete the analysis, and tell your\nsupervisor whether this is a good project.\n\nAdditional calculations for these cash flows:\n- Present worth of construction (year 1) plus rehabilitation (years 10 and 15) is $183.62\nmillion, assuming MARR of 10%.\n- Future worth of all revenues (years 5, 20, and 25) will be $36.098 billion at the end of\nyear 50, assuming MARR of 10%.\n(15% of assignment)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.011 Project Evaluation\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

If\nyou can complete this assignment, then you have an excellent grasp of the concepts and\napplications of equivalence and you will gain some clear insight into the financial mechanisms\nunderlying a large infrastructure project.\nLecture 9\nLecture 16\n\nFinancing a Skyscraper\nA simple cost model for the construction of a skyscraper could be based upon the following\nelements:\na) The land area (acres) and the price of the land ($0.1 to $10 million/acre)\nb) The costs of clearing the land ($10 to $50,000/acre)\nc) The foundation ($2-4 million/acre)\nd) The weight-bearing structure\ne) The exterior of the building, including windows, exterior materials, waterproofing, and\ninsulation\nf) The elevators\ng) Heating, air conditioning, ventilation\nh) Creation of a dramatic entry area and mini-parks\ni) Interior walls\nj) Interior finishing\nFor any infrastructure development, we are generally considering whether to begin a particular\ntype of project. We probably have several basic design and location options plus numerous\nminor variations on these options (e.g., variations in size or quality of components). From the\nunderlying logic of the project, we can develop a function that relates the project costs to the\ndesign and location possibilities. Separate functions can be used to estimate the initial investment\ncosts as well as the fixed and variable operating costs. As engineers, it is our job to understand\nwhat options are available, including new designs or construction techniques as well as tried-\nand-true approaches.\nRevenues\nWe also would like to estimate the demand for the services provided by our project, taking into\naccount the quality of the service provided, the capacity of our project and competing facilities,\nand the price that we and our competitors charge. For a skyscraper, the revenues will be based\nupon the rental rates, commonly expressed as the annual rent per square foot. A skyscraper\nmakes financial sense if the projected rents (net of any continuing expenses) will be sufficient to\njustify a mortgage sufficiently large to cover all of the construction costs, including interest on a\nconstruction loan.\nTiming and Cost Assumptions\nThis assignment is based upon the construction of the Worldwide Plaza, which was presented as\na case study in Section 7.7 of the Chapter 7 in the Martland text. Karl Sabbagh's very interesting\nbook describes the people and the processes involved in constructing a 50-story office building\nplus some smaller buildings in Manhattan. As is the case with most engineering books, the focus\n\nis on the technical rather than the financial matters. Hence, in addition to the information\npresented previously (which is about all there is in the book), some additional assumptions are\nneeded to evaluate various options for the project:\na) The time between land acquisition and beginning of construction is exactly 18 months.\nAll of the engineering and architectural work is completed during this period.\nb) The time from groundbreaking until the time that tenants can move in is exactly 24\nmonths (i.e., months 19 to 42 of the project if it is completed on time).\nc) The permanent mortgage is obtained 3 months after the tenants move in (at the end of\nmonth 45 if the project is completed on time).\nd) The tenants have 4 months (to fix up the interior) before they make their first rent\npayment (at the end of month 46 if the project is completed on time).\ne) The fixed costs include $58 million for land acquisition, $5 million for preparation of the\ncase for development, the architects' and engineers' fees (assumed to be $90 million of\nthe $145 million for fees and borrowing costs cited in the note), $45 million of the\nconstruction costs (for the foundation, landscaping, entry, lobby, and roof), and $5\nmillion of the project management costs.\nf) The $90 million architect/engineering fees are paid uniformly over the first 18 months of\nthe project; the $145 million construction costs are paid uniformly over the period of\nconstruction.\ng) The construction could be stretched out over 3 years with a savings in construction of $5\nmillion and essentially no chance of an overrun.\nh) The project costs are covered by a construction loan with interest of 10% per year\ncharged from the point that costs were incurred. (This type of loan works like a\ncheckbook--the owner writes checks for all payments, and the amount of the check is\nadded to the outstanding amount of the loan. Interest is charged and added to the\noutstanding balance at the end of each month. Note that the owner doesn't actually pay\nany cash until the construction loan is repaid.)\ni) When the project is completed, the construction loan can be refinanced as a 30-year\nmortgage at a rate of 8%.)\nj) All invoice and loan payments are made on the last day of the month.\nk) Additional space, if available, could likely be rented at $30/sq ft per year or more.\nQuestions\n1. Project cost: Construct a spreadsheet that can be used to calculate the costs of\nconstruction, including interest costs on the construction loan. Structure the spreadsheet\nto show the various cost categories across the top and the months (1 to 48) down the side.\nHave columns for total monthly cost in each of the various cost categories, a column for\nthe total, and another column for the cumulative costs as of the end of the month. With\nthis information, you can calculate the monthly interest charged on the cumulative costs\n\nat the end of each month (remember to use the monthly, not the annual rate of interest!).\nYou can also calculate the present worth (PW) of the total project costs (use discreet\ndiscounting, compounded monthly). Have an area at the top of the spreadsheet where you\ncan enter key parameters (including interest rate on the construction loan, length of the\nconstruction period, and the owner's discount rate) when doing sensitivity analysis. Use\nthe spreadsheet to answer the following questions:\na. Estimate the total project cost as of the end of month 45 when--if all goes well--\nthe permanent mortgage is secured. (The total cost is the sum of interest cost plus\nconstruction cost, which will equal the total amount of the construction loan as of\nthe end of month 45. This amount should be roughly comparable to the $370\nmillion cited in the case study.)\nb. What is the present worth of the total project cost as of the beginning of month 1,\nassuming a discount rate of 15%?\nc. How would the total project cost (as calculated in part a) and the PW (as\ncalculated in part b) vary under the following circumstances?\ni. If the interest rate for the construction loan were 8% or 12% rather than\n10%?\nii. If the time required for construction were 30 or 36 months rather than 24\nmonths?\niii. If the owner's discount rate were 12% or 18%?\n\n2. Project revenue: Assume that the project has one major tenant who pays $26/sq ft for\n600,000 sq ft and another who pays $29/sq ft for 200,000 sq ft, while all other space is\nrented at $30/sq ft (these are annual rates per square foot for long-term leases).\na. Calculate the monthly revenue assuming that the building is fully leased from the\noutset.\nb. Calculate the PWof the revenue as of the beginning of the first month in which\nrents are received (use the owner's discount rate of 15%).\nc. Calculate the PW of the revenue as of the beginning of month 1 (using the\nowner's discount rate of 15%).\nd. From the owner's perspective, is this a worthwhile project?\n\n3. Refinancing: Once the building is up and rented, the owner can refinance the building at a\nlower interest rate because the bankers now can see the completed building and the\npaying tenants. Assume that the bank will provide a 30-year mortgage with the maximum\namount no greater than the minimum of (a) project cost or (b) 80% of the net present\nvalue of the rents (calculated with a discount rate equal to the interest rate on the loan).\nWhat would the maximum amount of the mortgage be? What would the monthly\npayments be?\n4. Selling the building: Once the building is refinanced, the owners may get bored simply\ncollecting rents and making mortgage payments.\na. What is the minimum sale price they should accept assuming that their discount\nrate remains 15%? (Assume that the new owners will take over the mortgage, and\nbe sure to include the balance on the mortgage in the sale price!)\nb. Suppose they see great opportunities in South American gold mines, where they\nexpect to make a 25% return--how low would they go?\nc. What would you recommend as a reasonable sale price for the building? Why?\n\nNote : Only 3-member teams are expected to complete question 5. 2-member teams are not\nrequired to do this question, though it may help further improve your understanding of the\nconcepts being taught in this course.\n\n5. Redesigning the building: Suppose that, early in the planning stage, the city planning\ndepartment offers you a chance to increase the floor area ratio to 15. (This would allow\nyou to add three stories and 100,000 sq ft of rentable space). All you have to do is\nprovide enclosed, all-weather walkways to neighboring buildings as part of a ''downtown\nmall'' concept. Assume that it would take 2 months longer to construct the somewhat\nlarger and more complex project. How much additional cost would you be willing to pay\nto construct the all-weather walkways in order to gain the benefits of the added rentable\nspace? (Be careful to consider all of the relevant costs and revenues.)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.011 Project Evaluation\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The team is required to submit a single assignment\nreport.\n\nThe purpose of this assignment is to give you some practice in thinking about stakeholders and how one\ndescribes and categorizes them.\nFirst read the assigned sections (pages 853-855, 865-869 and 872-879) of Mitchell (1997), \"Toward a\ntheory of stakeholder identification and salience - Defining the principle of who and what counts\". You\nwere expected to do so for Lecture 15.\n\nThen consider high-speed rail (HSR) in the U.S. as the system of interest. We presented two presentation\nslides in Lecture 14, listing a number of different stakeholders in the HSR system. Do the following for\nfour* of those stakeholders. One must be the traveling public; the other three are your choice. For each of\nyour stakeholders, describe and then categorize that stakeholder using the Mitchell framework. You need to\nbriefly justify why you selected a particular category for each stakeholder. You should be able to do all this\nin <1/2-page (total) for each stakeholder.\nWe hope this will give you some confidence to use the Mitchell framework in understanding the\nstakeholders in your term project as well. Although it is not required that you do so, we suspect you might\nfind it useful to think in those terms for your system of interest.\n\n*3-person teams should select six stakeholders\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.011 Project Evaluation\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Sullivan, E.M. Wicks, and J.T.

This is\noften the basis for planning, financing, and negotiation.\nEquivalence is a Critical, Complex, and\nInteresting Concept\n\nUsing Equivalence\nIf we have an appropriate discount rate, we\ncan convert any arbitrary stream of cash\nflows to various equivalent (but more easily\nunderstood) cash flows:\nP = present value\nF = future value at time t\nA = annuity of A per period for N periods\nTo make these conversions, we first need to\nunderstand the \"time value of money\"\n\nTime Value of Money\n- $1 today is worth more than $1 next year. How\nmuch more depends upon opportunities that are\navailable (and how much we want to \"discount\"\nfuture costs and benefits)\n\n- If we invest in a government bond paying i% per\nyear interest, then the money will grow to $1+i in one\nyear and $1 * (1+i)t after t years\n\n- Likewise, $1 at the end of t years is equivalent to\nhaving $1/(1+i)t today and investing the money in\nbonds paying i% interest.\n\nNet Present Value (NPV)\nThe NPV (or \"present worth\") is an estimate of the\npresent value of future costs and benefits:\n\nGiven:\n\nC(t) = Costs during period t\nB(t) = Benefits during period t\nNet benefits during period t = B(t) -

At the conference, Cahill expressed his desire for\n\"proper facilities for the expression of talent and the staging of the highest forms of\nentertainment...that will be a credit to the State not only today but for hundreds of years.\"\nOut of the 21 possible sites of the proposed opera house, Bennelong Point, a peninsula of\n2.23 hectares (240000 ft2) was chosen on May 17, 1955. The tram shed, which was located\nthere, was removed: a change welcomed by the Opera House Committee and the residents\nof Sydney.\n\nOn February 1, 1956, the international competition for the national opera house was\ncommenced. The competition, arranged by Premier Cahill and the government of New\nSouth Wales, provided competitors with a 25‐page booklet with black and white photos of\nBennelong Point. Detailed in the booklet were the requirements for the opera house\nincluding a large hall for symphony concerts, large‐scale opera, ballet and dance, choral,\npageants, and mass meetings that could seat 3000‐3500 people and a small hall for\ndramatic presentations, intimate opera, chamber music, concerts, recitals, and lectures that\ncould seat 1200. The structure also required a restaurant with a capacity of 250 and two\nmeeting rooms, one for 100 people and one for 200 people. The competition closed in late\n1956 with 233 entries representing 28 countries, including Australia, England, Germany,\nFrench Morocco, Iran, and Kenya.\n\nIn early January of 1957, 38‐year old Danish architect, Jørn Utzon, was announced as\nthe winner of the competition by Cahill at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Utzon had\ndesigned the opera house without first having seen the site in person and he relied on\nphotographs, shipping maps, and firsthand accounts. The judges chose Utzon's design\nbased on its pure originality and creativity, realizing that it would \"clearly be a\n\ncontroversial design.\" However, they were still convinced of its merits to New South Wales\nand Sydney. The original drawing featured Utzon's structurally unrealizable, but\naesthetically pleasing roof design.\n\nOn July 19, 1957, the Sydney Opera House Lottery Fund was established. As it\nwould turn out, the lotteriesiv would pay for the majority of the initial construction cost, as\nthe government of New South Wales did not want to pay for the project.\n\nWith Utzon's approval, Ove Arup and Partners was appointed as the structural\nengineers for the project in 1958 and construction of the Sydney Opera House began in\n1959. It was expected to take four years to complete with an estimated cost of AUS $7 M.\nHowever, even working together with Arup, Utzon did not come up with the final spherical\ndesign of the roof until sometime between 1961 and 1962; three to four years after\nconstruction began.\n\nThe Sydney Opera House would be one of the first major projects designed using\ncomputer‐aided design (CAD)v and presented major revolutionary architectural concepts\nand engineering challenges. It was also one of the first major projects, which employed the\nuse of computers to analyze internal load effects on the members that would support the\nroof structurevi.\nAltogether, the Sydney Opera House took fourteen years to complete and\nconstruction costs amounted to nearly AUS $102 M (actual dollars). Since its initial\nopening in 1973, the Sydney Opera House has undergone numerous renovations and\nexpansions and hosted many performances.\nTHE STAKEHOLDERSvii\nA project the magnitude of the Sydney Opera House, a public sector endeavor, had\nmany stakeholders. The following analysis of the stakeholders classifies them using the\nMitchell criteria, which determines and places stakeholders on the basis of whether or not\nthey possess any combination of the three following qualities: power, legitimacy, and\nurgency. In addition to this, the stakeholders will be evaluated within two different\ntimeframes: during the construction of the Sydney Opera House (1959‐1973) and the\nmodern day era.\n\nStakeholders during the initial construction period\n\nWhen the Sydney Opera House Project first started to take form in the mid 20th\ncentury, the government of New South Wales (NSW) was given a task to create a theater,\nwhich was intended to serve the arts. This makes the NSW government the very first\nstakeholder of the project. From the Mitchell perspective, the government was probably a\ndefinitive stakeholder, exhibiting power, legitimacy, and urgency, since they were given the\nresponsibility to facilitate the creation of such a project.\nChronologically, the next stakeholders are the judging panel of the international\ncompetition to design the future opera house. These stakeholders can be classified as\ndependent, because they were appointed by the government of New South Wales to choose\na design for the opera house; however, they lacked the power to do anything further once\nthe design was chosen.\n\nThe main stakeholder throughout the initial construction process (1959‐1973) was\nJørn Utzon, whose design was chosen out of a total of 233 entries. Since the project lacked\na proper manager, Utzon, along with Ove Arup, the chief structural engineer working on the\nproject, facilitated and oversaw the construction of the project. Together, they worked for\nfour years before arriving at the final design for the roof. This keen sense of architectural\nvision caused some problems, as Utzon would pay more attention to the design aspect of\nthe structure rather than the time and cost objectives. However, because he was\nessentially the project manager, nearly everything he said went through, which classifies\nhim as a definitive stakeholder under the Mitchell framework. Arup, who was for the most\npart Utzon's second in command, is also considered a definitive stakeholder.\n\nThis image has been removed\ndue to copyright restrictions.\nFigure 1: Utzon working on a model of the Opera Houseviii\n\nIn 1966, due to financial issues, Jørn Utzon resigned from the project before its\ncompletion, and the government eventually hired Hall, Todd, and Littlemore. Utzon left\nwith some of the original blueprints of the building, so Hall, Todd, and Littlemore had to\nspend time and money on additional designsix. This makes the Hall, Todd and Littlemore\ndefinitive stakeholders, because after Utzon left, they essentially assumed the roles of\nproject manager.\nIn 1967, at the request of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), the New\nSouth Wales government changed the proposed larger opera hall into the concert hall\nbecause symphony concerts, which were managed by ABC, were predicted to be more\npopular and able of drawing larger audiences than opera. Thus, the revenues to the opera\nhouse would increase. The Australian Broadcasting Commission, at this point in time, was\na dependent stakeholder, because they had legitimate and urgent concerns for a concert\nhall, but they had to rely on the NSW government to do their bidding.\n\nThe funding for the Sydney Opera House was done primarily through lotteries,\nwhich had participants who were most likely poor, as we will discuss in a later part of the\nproject. Without the lottery contestants, there would have been insufficient funding for the\nopera house. However, besides funding this endeavor, these contestants really had no\npower. These stakeholders also did not exhibit legitimacy or urgency; the contestants\nparticipated in the lotteries with their own benefits in mind. It can therefore be argued\nthat they did not quite have any interest in the Opera House and only sought to win the\njackpot, thus, they have none of the three qualities detailed by Mitchell so they are\nclassified as non‐stakeholders. However, this term could be a little misleading, because\nwithout their funding from the lotteries, it is doubtful whether or not the Sydney Opera\nHouse would be around today.\n\nThere was also an Opera House Committee formed in 1954, and the Sydney Opera\nHouse Executive Committee (SOHEC) replaced this entity in 1957. The Committee was\nUtzon's main client, that is, instead of interacting with the Government of New South Wales,\nUtzon only interacted with the Committee. The Committee had 3 advisory panels, one for\narchitectural and constructional aspects, one for traffic and one for music and dramax. It\ncontinued to make requests of changes to the design and capacity based on requests from\nthe Australian Broadcasting Commission and other individuals even into 1959, when\n\nconstruction has already beganxi. It was therefore a definitive stakeholder, as it was Utzon's\nmain client until 1960. At this point the government became concerned with the progress\nmade and decided to take control of the project directly under the Sydney Opera House Ac\noft 1960, which effectively gave the Minister of Public Works authority to supervise the\nworkxii.\n\nPresent day stakeholders\nToday, the Sydney Opera House remains an icon to the theatrical, structural and\narchitectural worlds. The New South Wales government continues to be a primary\nstakeholder, overseeing the operations of the opera house. The section of government that\nmaintains the theater is the Sydney Opera House Trust Fund, who operates the theater on\nbehalf of the NSW government. Although the group was created a while ago, they continue\nto help operate the Sydney Opera House.\n\nA public attraction such as the Sydney Opera House attracts a lot of locals and\ntourists every year. The main source of revenue for such a structure comes from admission\nfees, concert sales, tours and other public events. This makes the public discretionary\nstakeholder, because though they have no power or urgency, they exhibit legitimacy. Their\npresence adds immense value to the operations of the Opera House and their absence\nwould in essence destroy the primary aim of this iconic building. Their concerns and\nmeasures of satisfaction are therefore legitimate concerns of those in power.\nHowever, if the public insists on change, for whatever reason, their salience in the\neyes of the government could quickly increase. If, for example, the public suddenly\nbecomes unsatisfied with the operations of the opera house, they could form protests\ngroup and boycott ticket sales. These actions would give the public qualities of legitimacy\nand urgency, making them dependent stakeholders. They would be dependent on the\ngovernment of New South Wales to take action. It is important to note that this is only a\ntheoretical situation and is meant to exemplify the dynamic nature of the Mitchell\nclassification of stakeholders.\n\nMAJOR ISSUES THAT AFFECTED THE PROJECT\nThere were many uncertainties and risks associated with the Sydney Opera House\nproject. First, the design competition, though it was a good incentive, failed to evaluate\nhow much experience the entrants had with large‐scale design projects. Jørn Utzon's shell‐\nlike structure won the competition, even though his designs were only partially completed.\nHis designs were well ahead of their time and even as of 1959, when the government\nordered for construction to begin, there still existed no known methods to construct the\nproposed roof structurexiii. To further complicate the initial problem, the design required\nthat the roof spanned completely without columns, as Utzon wanted an open area with a\nceiling of structural ribsxiv.\nThe Sydney Opera House project had no project manager, and it was assumed that\nUtzon would take the initiative for all decisions regarding design, construction, or\ndevelopmentxv. There were no project evaluation measures or officially in place, and for\nthat reason, goalposts and implementation methods kept on changing. Some sections of\nthe opera house were even built then later demolished, re‐designed and built againxvi.\n\nOne aspect that was under great debate was the design of the opera house roof. As\nmentioned earlier, there was no known way to implement the original design. Therefore\nUtzon revised the design, however, it still proved to be a challenging and expensive task to\nactualize.\nAlong with the uncertainty related to the roof, there was also uncertainty about\ngovernment expectations of the project. Originally, the structure was to have two theaters;\nhowever; government later told Utzon that they wanted four theaters, which required him\nto redesign parts of the building, thus delaying construction. Due to these delays and\nchanges in the building blueprint, both the original cost and time estimates of AUS $7\nmillion and four years, respectively, seemed uncertain. As the costs continued to increase,\nan issue arose as to how this large‐scale project would be fundedxvii.\nThe government initially gave no limit to available finances, and then four years\nlater limited the funding resulting in discouragement, frustration and eventual withdrawal\nof Jørn Utzon in 1966xviii. The government later increased the funding massively, but Jørn\nUtzon had already left, with some of the initial blueprints, so new designs and\n\nmodifications had to be put in place. A group of Australian architects led by Peter Hallxix\ntook over and eventually completed the project, but since Utzon took his ideas with him,\nnew design plans had to be created. It should be noted that because no such feat had been\nattempted before, cost estimates were highly inaccurate. In the end, the building was finally\ncompleted for AUS $102 millionxx, an amount much greater the initial estimate given AUS\n$7 million.\nCOSTS AND BENEFITS\nInitial Analysis\nThe foundations began mid 1959. It was initially not clear how they even achieve\nthe structure, as it had never been done before. They also had no precedents for\ncomparison; it was therefore difficult to come up with feasible estimates. The other issue\nwas that actual construction began before the design could be completed which led to a\ngreat amount of waste because some parts had to built then demolished then built up\nagain; in addition Civil and Civic, the contractors, said that 700 drawings had been issued,\nalmost half had come after the expiry of the initial contract, and that there had been 695\namendments issued in the first phase of the project alone. xxi Estimates for the entire cost of\nconstruction had risen from AUS $7.2 M in 1957 to $9.8 M in 1958 to $18 M in 1961 to $\n24.5 M in 1962 to $34.8 M in 1964 and to $48.4 M in 1965.xxii By 1968 costs estimates had\nisen to\nr\nAUS $85 M.xxiii\n\nThe lack of proper planning prior to the execution of this plan was partially\nresponsible for the manner in which the estimates changed.\nLotteries used for financing\n\nThe Government of New South Wales would give no more than AUS £100,000 and\ndeclared that the rest of the funding would come from public lotteriesxxiv and a public\nappeal fund. The original appeal fund raised about AUS $900,000 and the rest of the $102M\nthat the Opera House ended up costing came from the profits of the lotteryxxv. In November\nof 1957, Opera House Lottery No.1 went on sale. Tickets were £5 each ($10) with a first\nprize of £100,000 ($200,000)xxvi. This lottery was revamped in 1960 with the costs of\n\ntickets reduced to £3 ($6) each and one‐off prizes of $200,000 introduced. The Opera\nHouse Lotteries raised more than $105 million towards the construction of the Sydney\npera House\nO\n\nxxvii.\n\nThis image has been removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nFig 2: Sydney Opera House original lottery ticket from ~19571958xxviii\nThe major benefit of using the lotteries as the major source of financing is that\nunlike loans or mortgages you pay back much less than you gain from the process. It also\nsaved the government from spending its own revenue, and in doing so kept the\ngovernment from using funds that would have taken out of more essential public projects\nsuch healthcare, education and infrastructure. However, was this really good for the\ngeneral public? It has been shown in America, for example in public state lotteries, that for\nthe most part:\n\nThe average [lottery] expenditure in dollars for households making $10,000 is about\nthe same as for those making $60,000. One implication of this pattern of demand is\nthat the tax implicit in lottery finance is regressive, in the sense that as a percentage of\nincome, tax payments decline as income increases.xxix\n\nIt can therefore be argued, that even in the case of the Sydney Opera House, it was\nthe relatively less wealthy that ended up bearing a disproportionate part of the cost of\nputting this relatively luxurious and iconic structure, which they probably would not use as\nmuch. So though this venture directly spared the government any direct expenditure, it\n\nmay in essence not have been very beneficial for the not so wealthy who readily bought up\nthe lotteries to raise the AUS $ 100 million.\nSIGNIFICANT DECISIONS THAT AFFECTED DESIGN AND\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\nDuring the design process and implementation of the building there were significant\nchanges to the original plans. First of all, the construction of the opera house was\nunderway before the designs were finalized, resulting in cost overruns and organizational\nchaos. Because of the major uncertainty in the design, costly mistakes were made during\nproduction. For example, huge supporting columns were built, demolished, and rebuilt for\na cost of $300,000 when the design changed from the original blueprint.xxx\nUtzon was quite stubborn and he refused to listen to the engineers' solution for the\nroof, resulting in additional delays and costs. For the first six years of the operation Utzon\nworked from Europe and refused to delegate tasks. Though Utzon had brilliant\narchitectural skills, he was not the best managerxxxi. His main concern during this time was\nthe architectural aesthetics of the roof design. This resulted in bottlenecks in the\nconstruction and caused delays. These increased delays, in turn, led to high staff\nturnovers.xxxii\nBecause it was still not known how the roof would actually be constructed, even\nyears into the construction, the design blueprints kept on changing (as shown Fig. 3 below).\nMichael Baume, in the Sydney Opera House Affair narrates:\n\nCivil and Civic, the contractors said that 700 drawings had been issued, almost half had\ncome after the expiry of the initial contract, and that there had been 695 amendments\nissued in the first phase of the project alone. In addition, many of the items priced in the\ninitial estimates that cost a total of 1.1$ M were replaced with new items that cost $3.2\nM.xxxiii\n\nF\n\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nFigure 3: The Evolution of the Sydney Opera House Design. The general form went from just a freehand form,\ninto a parabolic, then ellipsoid form. The final shape chosen was spherical, because of the ease of construction\nand ease of calculating the structural integrity.xxxiv\nThe final solution was then chosen from spherical sections. The spherical selections\nwere selected because, they were easy to construct from pre‐cast forms, and it was easier\nto perform a structural analysis than in the other models. This final development is shown\nin Figure 4, below.\n\nThis image has been removed due to copyright\nrestrictions.\n\nFigure 4: Utzon's Final Solution to the roof problem; precast spherical shapesxxxv\nT\nr significant changes to the design after Utzon left\nhe fou\nxxxvi:\n\nAfter Utzon's resignation from the project in 1966, a group of Australian architects\nled by Peter Hall took over. As mentioned above, Utzon took some of his designs with him,\nforcing Hall and company to come up with new designs. During this stage of construction,\nthe design underwent four significant changes.\n\nThe first significant change to the design was to the cladding of the podium and the\npaving. Utzon's original intention was to use a system of prefabricated plywood mullions.\n\nThe system that was actually constructed was made to deal with the glass, which was\nifferen\nd\nt from Utzon's design.\n\nSecond, there was a major change in the purposes of each of the planned rooms.\nThe major hall, which was meant to be a multipurpose opera or concert hall, became solely\na concert hall. To accommodate the operas, the minor hall, which was originally intended\nfor stag\n\ne productions, had to be converted to serve both operas and stage productions.\nThird, two more theaters were added to the design. This overhaul of the design\ncompletely changed the layout of the interiors. The stage machinery, which had previously\nbeen designed and fitted inside the major hall, had to be pulled out and thrown away.\n\nFourth, the movement and redesign of the various rooms had significant impacts on\nthe acoustics of the building. Utzon had originally designed the interior with acoustics in\nmind. His original designs were modeled and found to be acoustically perfect. However,\nUtzon's interior designs, including the plywood corridor designs, as well as his seating\ndesigns were completely scrapped by Peter Hall and company. Therefore, the current\ninternal organization is not optimal.\nSTATUS OF THE PROJECT\nThe building currently has 5 main auditoria and nearly 1000 rooms, a reception hall,\n5 rehearsal studios, 4 restaurants, 6 theatre bars, an extensive foyer, library, and\nadministrative offices.xxxvii The building covers about 1.8 hectares (4.5 acres) of its 2.2\nhectares (5.5 acre) site and has about 4.5 hectares (11 acres) of usable floor space. There\nare 645 km (400 miles) of electrical cable within this complex and its energy needs are\nequivalent to the needs of a town of 25,000 people. More than these impressive features\nhowever, the Sydney Opera House became and remains a world‐class performing arts\ncenter, and the iconic symbol of Sydney, and to some extent, Australiaxxxviii.\nIn 2007, UNESCO named the Sydney Opera House a World Heritage Site. Today the\ninstitution conducts 3000 events yearly, which draw annual audiences of about 2 million.\nThe Sydney Opera House also provides guided tours to 200,000 each year.xxxix\n\nOUR ANALYSIS OF THE RELEVANT COSTS AND BENEFITS\n\nThe main aims of the financial analysis were as follows:\n- To attempt to figure out whether the Sydney Opera House was and currently is a\nprofitable venture.\n- To see whether it would be a self‐sustainable venture in the coming years.\n- To attempt to figure out what the value of the Sydney Opera House is to the people\nof New South Wales, and Australia in general; and figure out either what they pay\nfor having this iconic building or what they receive in payments for having this\nbuilding.\nFor details on any of these conclusions or calculation methodology, please refer to the\nappendix.\nAnalysis of Initial Construction Costs:xl\n\nThe construction period of the Sydney Opera House lasted from about 1957‐1973.\nThe initial construction can be broken down into three stages. Stage I, the construction of\nthe platform, lasted from 1957‐1963, with Utzon as architect. Stage II, the implementation\nof the roof, lasted from 1963‐1967, again with Utzon as the main architect. It should also\nbe noted that Ove Arup helped Utzon come up with the final spherical design of the roof.\nStage III, the final stage of construction, which consisted of fabricating the interior, lasted\nfrom 1967‐1973 and was led by Peter Hall.\n\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions. Original\nimage can be viewed here: http://www.andreas-\npraefcke.de/carthalia/world/images/aus_sydney_oper\na_9.jpg\nFigure 5: Construction of the Sydney Opera Housexli\n\nThe costs (in actual millions) in Australian dollars for each stage, respectively, were\nAUS $5.2 M, AUS $13.2 M, and AUS $80.4 M. The reason why Stage III cost that much is\nbecause the architects, Hall, Todd, and Littlemore had to start some aspects of the design\nfrom scratch. Upon his resignation in 1966, Utzon took some of the initial blueprints with\ne.\nhim, forcing Peter Hall to come up with new plans, resulting in a large increase in the pric\n\nThe following is an analysis of the present value (PV) of these costs. It is assumed\nthat the costs of each stage can be represented as a lump‐sum cost at the end of that stage's\nyear. This analysis also neglects the effect of inflation. Using this information, it is possible\nto estimate an amount that had to be paid per year (an annuity) during each stage of the\nproject. This can be done using the sinking fund payment equation, A = F[A/F,i,N]. In this\ncase the discount rate (i) is chosen to be 8%, a typical value given to projects funded by the\npublic sector. N varies with each stage and is found by subtracting the start year of that\nperiod from the end year of that period. Using the lump‐sum values, the value in 2010 can\nalso be determined using the future value given the present value formula, F = P[F/P,i,N]. N\nvaries with each stage and is found by subtracting the year of the lump‐sum 2010 (the year\nthat the cost should be discounted to). The results are summarized in the Table 1, below.\nTable 1: Construction Costs for the 3 key stages\nYear\nStage\nCost ሺActual\nMillionሻ\nCost Per Year\nሺDiscounted at 8%ሻ\n2010 Value of Costs\nሺDiscounted at 8%ሻ\nStage 1 start\n\n708,840.01\n\n708,840.01\n\n708,840.01\n\n708,840.01\n\n708,840.01\n\n708,840.01\n\nStage 1 end, Stage 2 start\n5,200,000.00\n2,929,354.62\n193,606,463.28\n\n2,929,354.62\n\n2,929,354.62\n\n2,929,354.62\n\nStage 2 end, Stage 3 start\n13,200,000.00\n10,959,757.05\n361,239,653.59\n\n10,959,757.05\n\n10,959,757.05\n\n10,959,757.05\n\n10,959,757.05\n\n10,959,757.05\n\nStage 3 end\n80,400,000.00\n\n1,386,548,297.03\n...\n\nPresent Value of\nconstruction costs:\n1,941,394,413.90\n\nThe following graph shows the annual expenditures during the construction period\nof the Sydney Opera House. It should be noted that all these funds other than an initial AUS\n100,000 given by the government, were obtained via public lotteries.\n$\n\nGraph 1: Estimated Construction Expenditure\n\nBy looking at the table above, it is seen that the 2010 value of the construction costs\nis about AUS $2 billion, which is quite a large number considering the fact that the costs in\nactual million was about AUS $100 M. The conversion from Australian dollars to US dollars\nis about a 1 to 1 ratio. This shows the powerful effect of figuring out future values given\npast values. In retrospect, $2 billion may not be that much, considering how much the\ngovernment spends every day. In our initial assumptions, we thought that the value of\nbeing such an iconic structure throughout all these years would outweigh this cost.\nHowever, our cash flows from the period of operation tell a different story.\nIt is important to note that this analysis was only performed for the costs of the\ninitial construction period. Since 1973, the Sydney Opera House has gone through several\nrenovations and transformations, from exterior and interior upgrades to creation of an\nunderground parking lot. These renovations have increased its costs and expenditure\nsignificantly.\nAnalysis of Operational Period (1973‐2010):\nFor the period it has been in operation, we use the annual financial reports for the\nexact details of the revenue and expenditure.\n\nRevenuexlii\nThe Sydney Opera House receives great volumes of money each year. For purposes\nof comparison, we bring all the revenue received since the official opening until 2010 and\ndiscount them at 8% to bring all the values to present value as of 2010. We use 8% because\nit is a typical approximate discount rate in long‐term public service project. We classify this\nas a public project because the government allocates most of the revenue to it, as we will\nsee in the cash flow diagrams shown below. The revenue received from operations came\nfrom tickets sales, shows, merchandizing, catering, festivals and tours, and grants from\nprivate donors.\n\nGraph 2: Revenue Breakdown for Operation period (2010 AUS$)\n\nGraph 3: Revenue Breakdown for Operation period (%)\n\nIn the top‐most cash flow diagram, we look at volumes of money received in the\nsecond we see what fractions came purely from the government and what came from\noperations of the House. Over the years the Sydney Opera House has been open, they have\nreceived a total of ~AUS $ 5.6 billion (2010 value); of that AUS $2.85 billion dollars has\nbeen from the government.\nExpenditurexliii\nWhen we look additionally into the expenditure over the years, we note that the\nexpenditure was always greater than the operational revenue, and had it not been for the\ngovernment endowments, the Sydney Opera House would perpetually be in debt. The\nvalues given for expenditure mostly arose from salaries of staff, depreciation of the\nproperty and maintenance & repairs. This building is always in need of great amount of\nrepair, maintenance and renovation, and thus renovations and repair form a great part of\nthe expenditure.\n\nThe total expenditure over the years the Sydney Opera House has been in operation\namounts to ~AUS$ 5.5 billion, a number very close to the total revenues received. In\nfollowing cash flow diagrams we compare the expenditure to the revenues, with and\nwithout the government contributions, in an attempt to analyze whether the project would\nbe self‐sustainable, and the answer seems to a be a resounding \"no\" seeing that there is not\na single year where the operational revenue would meet the expenditure.\n\nGraph 4: Operational Revenue and Expenditure Breakdown without Government\nContributions (2010 AUS $)\n\nNet Cash Flows\nThe net cash flows clarify the magnitude of the expenditure even further. The NPV\nof the Total Summation of Net Cash Flows in 2010 value comes to AUS $100 million, which\nlooks somewhat dismal considering the amount of money that has been invested into this\nproject. We should note that this amount does not include the NPV of construction costs.\n\nGraph 5: Net Cash Flows without Government Contributions (2010 AUS $)\n\nGraph 6: Net Cash Flows (2010 AUS $)\nCRITIQUE OF THE PROJECT AND PROJECT EVALUATION PROCESS\nW\na profitable venture?\n\nIn this financial analysis, two periods were looked at: the construction period and\nthe period during which the Sydney Opera House was operated. The present values (in\n2010) of the costs and benefits incurred during these time periods were calculated using a\ndiscoun\nas it\nt rate of 8%.\nDuring the construction period, only costs were incurred and the present value of\nthe construction cost is about AUS $2 B. From 1973 to the present day, the present value of\nthe costs is about AUS $5.5 B. During this same time period, benefits from operations and\ngovernment revenues have a present value of about AUS ~$5.6 B. Subtracting the benefits\nfrom the costs results in a net cash flow of about AUS ~$100 M. It is important to note that\nabout AUS $2.9 B of the revenue (a little over half!) was from the government. It can then\nbe concluded that AUS $2.7 B was accumulated through the actual operation of the opera\nhouse. If the cost (AUS $5.5 B) is subtracted from the operating revenues, the present value\nnet cash flow is AUS ‐$2.8 B, which is a large deficit. It is important to note that this does\nnot take into account the construction costs. Adding in the construction costs brings the\noperational cash flow even lower to about AUS ‐$4.8 B.\nThe results from the analysis show that from a strictly financial standpoint, the\nSydney Opera House was not a viable project at all. So why is it that the Sydney Opera\nHouse is still standing today despite its financial flaws? This question will be addressed in\nthe next section.\nH\ne are attempting to quantify its value to the people of New South Wales?\n\nFrom the analysis, it shows that the Sydney Opera House is not a profitable project.\nHowever, today it remains an apex in the world of architecture for its innovative design. It\nalso hosts over a thousand operas, concerts, etc. per year. Its iconic value to the citizens of\nNew South Wales and Australia is most likely what is keeping the structure in commission.\nIts iconic value is quite hard to quantify, however, as seen above the opera house's\now w\n\noperational activities would have not been enough to break even. The government of New\nSouth Wales has contributed a present value of almost AUS $3 B to the opera house to help\nkeep it in function. The government might know that the Sydney Opera House is not doing\nwell financially; however, to the people of New South Wales it remains an important icon.\nTherefore, as a rough estimate, the iconic value of the opera house to the public can be\nestimated as the government's contribution throughout the years, a value of nearly AUS $3\nB.\nI\nancially sustainable for the future?\n\nIn the past ten years, it seems that the Sydney Opera House has at least been\ncontributing 50% of the revenue solely through its operations. Even though this is over\nhalf of their revenues through their years, the ratio of operational revenue to government\nrevenue should be much higher. Considering the fact that in these next years, the Sydney\nOpera House plans to undergo more renovations and total refurbishment, currently valued\nat AUS $800 billion\ns it fin\nxliv, additional costs will be accrued. The opera house is already in huge\ndebt and this will only increase in the next decade or so. Operational revenues will\nprobably not increase much, so therefore government revenue must increase to help\nfinance these expenditures. Because the Sydney Opera House is such an icon, the\ngovernment will probably continue to fund it for a while. However, at one point the\ngovernment may realize that it cannot continue to fund the opera house, and will\neventually suspend funding. Therefore, it does not seem that the Sydney Opera House is\ndefinitely financially sustainable for the future.\nAdditional Information: What does the AUS $ 800 million Total Refurbishment\nrecommended in 2010 really mean?\nhe table below compares it to current maintenance costs from the past decade.\nT\n\nTable 2: Maintenance Costs for 20002010\nYear\nExpenditure In\nActual Dollars\n(AUS $)\nExpenditure in 2010\ndollars using 8%\n(AUS $)\nExpenditure in 2010\ndollars using 5%\n(AUS $)\nExpenditure in 2010\ndollars using 2.5%\n(AUS $)\n\n15,467,000\n33,392,093\n25,194,113\n19,799,068\n13,493,000\n26,972,569\n20,932,072\n16,850,908\n15,310,000\n28,337,742\n22,619,843\n18,653,748\n15,109,000\n25,894,171\n21,259,880\n17,959,853\n16,420,000\n26,056,476\n22,004,370\n19,042,166\n16,987,000\n24,959,476\n21,680,195\n19,219,231\n18,344,000\n24,956,809\n22,297,247\n20,248,344\n14,821,000\n18,670,192\n17,157,160\n15,960,596\n15,968,000\n18,625,075\n17,604,720\n16,776,380\n17,849,000\n19,276,920\n18,741,450\n18,295,225\n17,939,000\n17,939,000\n17,939,000\n17,939,000\n\nSeeing that they need to add about $800 million to the maintenance budget to keep\nit in operation; if for example the maintenance was prioritized such that only about AUS\n$40 million was used every year for the next ten years, this would mean that the Sydney\nOpera House would need to on average triple expenditure on maintenance to handle both\nthe regular annual maintenance works and carry out the required renovation. For this to\nremain a feasible option, we would need to consider other options for funding: Would the\ngovernment be willing to finance this? Would the people of New South Wales find this a\nworthy venture to invest in for the next ten year? Based on current operational revenue,\nwould this be considered a profitable venture by private financiers? Currently, the future\nseems bleak for many of these options seeing that its operational revenue already does not\nmeet the annual expenditure.\nCritique of the Project and Conclusions from Our Project\nFrom th\nEvaluation Process\nis project, and the mistakes made therein, we learn:\nWe learn the importance of planning well before implementing a project. Complete\ndesigns would have saved this project a great amount of money and time.\n\nWe learn that it is important to consult with other experts when embarking on an\nunprecedented venture. The initial cost estimates and structural sketches had been given\nwith out structural expertise, this also led to many iterations of the design, and could have\nbeen avoided to some extent.\n\nThe choice material and final design greatly influence final maintenance costs. In the\ncase of the Sydney Opera House, the final design and material choice has led to high\nainte\nm\nnance costs over the years due to its very delicate form.\n\nThe project has shown the importance of implementing a good project management\nstrategy, especially when implementing a large‐scale unprecedented plan. Utzon was\nknown to be a brilliant architect but very poor manager. Seeking a project manager would\nhave been of great benefit to this process.\n\nIt also shows as the importance of having government backing. Government support\nand approval of this plan enabled it to have large access to public funds created via a public\nlottery, and this ensured that the finances were always catered for during the construction\nperiod. In the operating life, the government has also continued to keep the Opera House\nfloat.\na\n\nComments on the Project Evaluation Process\n\nThe financial analysis given in this report is by no means 100% accurate. Several\nassumptions were made throughout the financial analysis to simply the process. First of\nall, we only know for sure the exchange rate of the AUS $ to the US $ in 2010, it is therefore\nslightly difficult to get a feel for what the Actual 1972 Australian Dollars means in 1972 US$\nas we do not have exchange rate data to span the length of the project. We therefore bring\nall AUS $ to 2010 value and then compare these values to USD. We do note that this is an\napproximation and that there are many economic nuances that this simplification does not\naddress.\nIn addtion, when discounting the cash flows back to the present day, a discount rate\nof 8% is assumed throughout, as this the discount rate assigned to most public sector\nprojects.xlv The discount rate can easily change from year to year, especially during the\nvarious construction stages of the project. Also, it has been assumed that the construction\ncosts for the three stages are paid as a lump sum at the end of each stage, which can then be\nmodeled as an annuity. In reality, the costs probably varied from year to year. There may\nalso be a little variation between the actual cash flows from 1973‐2010 and what is shown\nabove. Although the official financial reports of the Sydney Opera House were obtained,\n\nthere was a lot of financial data that it was difficult to sift through what was actually\nrelevant for the financial analysis.\nHowever, had these simplifications and assumptions not been made, it would have\nbeen very difficult to carry out a financial analysis. There are too many different variables\nand dynamic elements that would have to be accounted for to perform a flawless analysis.\nDespite these circumstances, the authors feel that they have captured the essence of a\nthorough financial analysis of the Sydney Opera House.\n\nAPPENDIX\nGeneral Formulas\nIt is possible to estimate an amount that had to be paid per year (an annuity) during each\ntage of the project. This can be done using the sinking fund payment equation:\ns\n\nA = F[A/F,i,N] = F*[i/((1+i)N‐1)]\n\nN is the amount of years the annuity has to be paid to meet a certain future value F given a\nertain discount rate, i.\nc\n\nGiven a past cash flow, it is possible to discount it to the future using the following\nquation:\ne\n\nF = P[F/P, i, N] = P*(1+i%)N\n\nN varies by year and is found by subtracting the year of the past value from 2010 (the year\nthat the cash flow should be discounted to). The discount rate (i) is taken to be 8% as\nmentioned above.\n\nR\n\nevenue From Operational Period\nYEAR\nRevenue\nfrom\nOperations\n(Actual\nMillions)\nRevenue\nfrom\nOperations\n(2010, 8%)\nRevenue\nfrom\nGovernment\n(Actual\nMillions)\nRevenue\nfrom\nGovernment\n(2010, 8%)\nRevenue\nTotal\n(Actual\nMillions)\nRevenue\nTotal (2010,\n8%)\n1,680,424\n28,979,957\n3,652,295\n62,986,112\n5,332,719\n91,966,069\n2,470,982\n39,457,071\n3,950,000\n63,074,279\n6,420,982\n102,531,350\n2,887,411\n42,691,372\n4,456,000\n65,883,494\n7,343,411\n108,574,866\n3,183,170\n43,578,023\n4,980,000\n68,176,865\n8,163,170\n111,754,888\n5,301,379\n67,200,543\n5,692,000\n72,152,075\n10,993,379\n139,352,618\n6,166,970\n72,382,239\n5,950,000\n69,835,644\n12,116,970\n142,217,883\n7,030,687\n76,407,182\n6,252,000\n67,944,669\n13,282,687\n144,351,852\n8,044,039\n80,944,404\n6,700,000\n67,419,801\n14,744,039\n148,364,206\n9,525,351\n88,750,314\n7,331,000\n68,304,942\n16,856,351\n157,055,256\n5,543,835\n47,827,254\n8,100,000\n69,879,562\n13,643,835\n117,706,816\n6,800,960\n54,326,487\n8,400,000\n67,099,716\n15,200,960\n121,426,203\n6,681,000\n49,415,036\n8,495,000\n62,832,021\n15,176,000\n112,247,056\n7,393,000\n50,630,777\n9,518,000\n65,183,787\n16,911,000\n115,814,564\n7,413,000\n47,007,173\n10,000,000\n63,411,807\n17,413,000\n110,418,980\n9,386,000\n55,109,558\n14,811,000\n86,962,248\n24,197,000\n142,071,806\n8,950,000\n48,657,037\n17,342,000\n94,280,484\n26,292,000\n142,937,521\n25,123,000\n126,465,004\n21,937,000\n110,427,210\n47,060,000\n236,892,215\n110,912,136\n26,749,000\n124,675,943\n50,545,000\n235,588,079\n24,109,000\n104,047,237\n23,248,000\n100,331,418\n47,357,000\n204,378,655\n\n26,442,000\n105,662,748\n24,903,000\n99,512,874\n51,345,000\n205,175,621\n30,775,000\n113,868,056\n24,832,000\n91,878,848\n55,607,000\n205,746,904\n22,673,000\n77,676,398\n30,472,000\n104,395,324\n53,145,000\n182,071,722\n26,245,000\n83,253,578\n31,842,000\n101,008,209\n58,087,000\n184,261,787\n30,872,000\n90,677,042\n28,246,000\n82,963,971\n59,118,000\n173,641,013\n37,349,000\n101,575,227\n33,086,000\n89,981,471\n70,435,000\n191,556,697\n28,382,000\n71,470,704\n30,328,000\n76,371,063\n58,710,000\n147,841,768\n43,319,000\n101,004,270\n\n6,262,000\n61,233,503\n69,581,000\n162,237,773\n32,908,000\n71,045,904\n28,687,000\n61,933,081\n61,595,000\n132,978,985\n50,683,000\n101,315,552\n9,513,000\n19,016,531\n60,196,000\n120,332,083\n36,277,000\n67,146,195\n59,168,000\n109,515,839\n95,445,000\n176,662,034\n32,736,000\n56,103,751\n31,583,000\n54,127,712\n64,319,000\n110,231,463\n38,496,000\n61,088,314\n53,206,000\n84,431,235\n91,702,000\n145,519,549\n40,482,000\n59,481,339\n51,646,000\n75,884,918\n92,128,000\n135,366,257\n43,351,000\n58,978,557\n68,279,000\n92,892,826\n111,6\n\n30,000\n151,871,383\n56,937,000\n71,724,222\n63,672,000\n80,208,382\n120,609,000\n151,932,605\n62,923,000\n73,393,387\n21,363,000\n24,917,803\n84,286,000\n98,311,190\n66,930,000\n72,284,400\n44,834,000\n48,420,720\n111,764,000\n120,705,120\n65,942,000\n65,942,000\n43,456,000\n43,456,000\n109,398,000\n109,398,000\nTOTAL\n945,208,208\n\n2,738,480,446\n\n902,941,295\n\n2,853,012,388\n\n1,848,149,503\n\n5,591,492,834\n\nE\n\nxpenditure from Operational Period\nYEAR\nTotal Expenditure\n(Actua\n)\nl Millions\nTotal Expenditure\n(2010, 8%)\n5,589,187\n96,389,029\n6,095,830\n97,339,258\n7,139,149\n105,554,776\n8,423,109\n115,313,488\n10,902,158\n138,196,296\n11,880,747\n139,445,314\n13,063,675\n141,971,702\n14,708,134\n148,002,906\n17,021,782\n158,596,622\n13,306,993\n114,800,844\n15,062,691\n120,321,702\n15,836,000\n117,128,649\n16,503,000\n113,020,386\n17,637,000\n111,839,405\n24,939,000\n146,428,432\n27,983,000\n152,130,710\n44,532,000\n224,166,683\n49,336,000\n229,952,982\n47,857,000\n206,536,506\n53,087,000\n212,136,687\n\n53,253,000\n197,037,061\n50,822,000\n174,113,257\n56,165,000\n178,164,878\n57,923,000\n170,131,066\n57,799,000\n157,191,532\n56,502,000\n142,281,648\n71,036,000\n165,630,308\n60,187,000\n129,939,219\n58,788,000\n117,517,484\n74,778,000\n138,408,859\n74,634,000\n127,909,560\n80,415,000\n127,608,499\n84,317,000\n123,889,335\n84,868,000\n115,461,977\n102,413,000\n129,010,885\n107,022,000\n124,830,461\n123,094,000\n132,941,520\n124,878,000\n124,878,000\nTOTAL\n1,799,797,455\n\n5,466,217,926\n\nNet Cash Flows from Operational Period\nYEAR\nNet Cashflow\n(Actual\nMillions)\nNet Cashflow\n(\n\n2010, 8%)\nSans Govt.

The City of Atlanta has experienced rapid, sprawling growth over the past\nseveral decades, which has resulted in congestion, uneven economic growth, limited public\nspace and automobile dependency. The Atlanta BeltLine aims to organize new growth\nalong with parks, transit, and trails within the inner core of Atlanta in order to change the\ntrend of suburban sprawl and improve the quality of life for all residents. The combination\nof land use, transportation planning, and social services create a complex mix of monetary\nand non‐monetary costs and benefits that affect the City of Atlanta. The purpose of this\nanalysis is to compare the $3 billion price tag of the project with the benefits accrued solely\nfrom the new parks and transit.\n\nI. Project Background and Motivation\n\nThe Atlanta BeltLine is a large‐scale redevelopment project designed to link 45\nneighborhoods and numerous parks in the center of Atlanta, Georgia in an effort to\nimprove the public transport network and the public green spaces, as well as increase the\noverall walk‐ability and livability of the city. The BeltLine, a 22‐mile loop of historic\nrailroad corridor encompassing the urban center of Atlanta, will be transformed into public\ntransit and integrated with the current transit infrastructure. Figure 1 shows the location\nof the BeltLine corridor. The goals of this project are to improve not only the\ntransportation network, but also the overall health of Atlanta residents; increase job\nopportunities, affordable housing, and community engagement; and to decrease the city's\nenvironmental impact. In addition to the transit route, the BeltLine will bring 33 miles of\ntrails and 1,300 acres of new park space. The Atlanta BeltLine will instigate change not\nonly in the neighborhoods bordering the project, but also in the greater Atlanta region.\nThe redevelopment of the BeltLine corridor was inspired in 1999 by the master's thesis\nof Georgia Tech graduate student, Ryan Gravel. \"Ryan's original concept [to link\nneighborhoods and develop new transit] has grown to include transit, parks and trails,\nneighborhood preservation and revitalization, mixed‐use development, affordable housing,\ncleaner air, and an improved tax base - all advancing economic development and quality of\nlife.\"i The project then gained grassroots support through community organizations and\nwas later picked up by Mayor Shirley Franklin. In only 12 years, the BeltLine was\ntransformed from a mere idea into an in‐progress, multi‐billion dollar urban\nredevelopment project.\n\nFigure 1: BeltLine Corridor and Zones.

Conditions prior to 2006\nAtlanta has a long history with transportation infrastructure. The city originated in the\nmid 1800s, at the terminus of the Western and Atlantic Railroad, and was fittingly named\n'Terminus'. Other rail lines soon extended to Atlanta, and it became a regional hub for\ntransportation. Railroads have been a crucial factor in defining Atlanta's economy and\ndevelopment throughout its history; the railroad led to Atlanta's distinction as a regional\ncommercial hub. Over the past 30 years, however, Atlanta has experienced \"uncontrollable\nsuburban growth and extensive inner city gentrification\"ii. While the region has\nexperienced population growth, the core of Atlanta experienced a decline in population\nfrom 1970 until the early 2000s. Figure 2 shows the population of Atlanta since 1960, as\nwell as population projections until 2030. The population of the center of Atlanta declined\nfrom a high of 497,024 in 1970 to a low of 394,017 in 1990iii. Even recent population\ngrowth leaves the city with a smaller population than in 1970. Despite this historic decline\nin growth, the population of Atlanta is projected to grow to over 600,000 by 2030.\nSimilarly to population, employment also declined during this period, in contrast to the\ngreater Fulton County area, and has only started to grow in the past several yearsiv.\n\nFigure 2: City of Atlanta Population, 1960‐2030. Source: Atlanta Regional Commissionv\nBar gra\nph of A\ntlanta'\ns popul\nation f\nrom 196\n0 to 20\n30.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\ni. Social Conditions\nOf particular interest with regards to the BeltLine project is the low‐income and\nminority populations within the BeltLine corridor. As an urban redevelopment project\nmeant to crosscut racial and socio‐economic lines, it is important that the demographics of\nthe corridor mirror those of the city. Atlanta has historically been segregated, with lower‐\nincome black neighborhoods in the south and wealthier neighborhoods in the north of the\ncity. According to US Census data, the 1999 median income for households in the City of\nAtlanta was $35,500. While the median income for the BeltLine study area is significantly\nhigher, at $43,000, the four different zones of the BeltLine vary in median income from\n$20,478 in the southwest zone to $48,149 in the northeast zone. Within the project\ncorridor, the percentage of the population living below the poverty level in 2000 was\n20.7%, compared to 24.4% in the greater City of Atlanta. The minority population in the\nBeltLine corridor ranges from 34.3% of residents in the northeast zone to 98.6% of\nresidents in the southwest zone. Minority population is defined by the US Department of\nTransportation Executive Order (5610.2) on Environmental Justice to include four groups:\nblack, Hispanic, Asian American and American Indian and Alaskan Native. Overall, the\nBeltLine corridor has a minority population percentage of 57.9%, compared to 68.7% in\nthe ity\nC\nof Atlantaiv.\n\nMirroring the racial and economic breakdown, the percentage of zero‐car\nhouseholds is highest in the southern zones of the BeltLine corridor. These populations are\nconsidered to be transit‐dependent. In the southwest zone, 34% of households do not have\na car, and 20.6% of workers 16 years and older rely on public transportation to get to\nwork. In the northeast zone, 17.4% of households do not have a car, and 10% of workers\nrely on public transportation to get to work. Within the entire corridor, 19.9% of\nhouseholds do not have a car, and 13.5% of workers rely on public transportation to get to\nwork. Within the city as a whole, 23.6% of households do not have a car and 15% of\nworkers rely on public transportationiv.\nii. Land Use\nEach of the four zones includes a variety of land uses that are residential, industrial,\ncommercial, open space, community facilities or institutional. All the zones also include\n\nvarying proportions of vacant land. The predominant existing land use is residential,\nranging from 38% in northeast zone to 67% in the southwest zoneiv. Open space and parks\ncurrently account for less than 2% of total BeltLine land, while more than 23% of land is\ncurrently used for industrial purposes. In addition, 6% of land remains vacant while\nanother 9% of land within the BeltLine corridor contains structures in substandard,\ndeteriorated or dilapidated conditions.v\nPrior to the commencement of the BeltLine project, there were 51 existing public parks\nwithin the 22‐mile BeltLine corridor, covering a total area of about 413 acres. Error!\nReference source not found. shows the location of existing parks within the BeltLine\ncorridor. There are six existing park classifications in Atlanta, all of which are present in\nthe corridor. The classifications are regional parks, drawing visitors from outside the city\nlimits; community parks, such as recreation centers and swimming pools; neighborhood\nparks, serving informal recreational needs of the community; block parks, small sites\ntypically including a playground; garden parks, small sites maintained for visual interest\nand conservation parks, managed for environmental protectioniv.\nThe history of industry within the BeltLine corridor created many potentially\ncontaminated sites. A study of sites within 1⁄4‐mile radius of the BeltLine alignment found\n234 sites within the corridor. The vast majority of these sites, 172 of 234, are located in the\nnorthern region of the BeltLine.\n\nFigure 3: Existing Parks, BeltLine Corridor.

Transportation\nPublic transportation in Atlanta is currently provided by MARTA, the Metropolitan\nAtlanta Rapid Transit Authority, and the GRTA, the Georgia Regional Transportation\nAuthority. The BeltLine will connect to three of the existing MARTA rail systems in five\nseparate locations across the four zones of the project. In addition, fifty‐six bus routes will\nconnect to the BeltLine. MARTA currently carries an average of 500,000 passengers per\nday on its four heavy rail lines and 125 bus routes.v\nMARTA currently runs four heavy rail lines in Atlanta, the Red, Gold, Green and Blue\nLines. The tracks for the system are a combination of elevated, ground‐level, and\nunderground tracks. These four lines follow roughly a north‐south and east‐west\nalignment, dividing the core of Atlanta into four quadrants. Two lines run in each direction,\nfollowing similar paths, often sharing a track. Figure 4 shows the location and alignment of\nthe existing heavy rail lines run by MARTA. MARTA also operates Atlanta's bus system,\nwhich has ninety‐one routes and covers over one thousand milesvi.\niv. Freight Rail Corridors\nDue to the nature of the project, the BeltLine corridor currently includes, or is adjacent\nto, both active and inactive freight rail corridors. This corridor includes segments of freight\nrail owned by The Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), Atlanta Development\nAuthority (ADA), CSX Transportation (CSXT) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS)iv.\nFigure 5 shows the alignment and usage of current freight rail corridors. The only\ncontinually active right‐of‐way is in the northwest segment, owned by CSX. A large portion\nof the northeast corridor and a segment in the southwest are owned by GDOT and are\navailable for the BeltLine redevelopment. The other segments remain inactive, or only\nmarginally active, and processes are underway to purchase these rights‐of‐way.\n\nFigure 4: The existing heavy rail system operated by MARTA.\nSource: http://www.itsmarta.com/rail‐schedules‐or‐route.aspx\n\nFigure 5: Freight Rail Corridors. Source: Georgia Department of Transportation iv\n\nB. Green space\nThe purpose of the BeltLine is to increase the amount of green space in Atlanta, which\nrepresents only 3.8% of the city's area. Over the 25 years of development, the BeltLine will\nincrease Atlanta's green space by nearly 40%vii. The BeltLine's five‐year work plan focuses\non the development of parks and trails in order provide as many benefits to the public as\npossible.\na. The BeltLine Arboretum\nSimilar to Boston's Emerald Necklace, thirteen expanded, new, and mixed use parks, or\n\"jewels\" will make up the BeltLine Emerald Necklace. In 2004, a mile‐by‐mile study,\ncommissioned by the Trust for Public Land, concluded that a cohesive and fully‐connected\npark system could be developed with strong community input. Over 1,300 acres of new\nparkland will be developed, and the BeltLine Arboretum will not only provide green space\nand extra carbon dioxide sequestration, but also education programming to residents and\nvisitors. The goal is to plant several thousand trees, increase the perceived value of trees in\nan urban environment, and improve neighborhood identity.\nb. Storm Water Management\nIn older parts of Atlanta, storm water and sewage systems are combined, and when\nthere are heavy rains, sewage overflows into the waterways.viii The Greenway Acquisition\nProject (GAP) intends to add natural vegetation to mitigate storm water runoff. Initiatives\nlike the Clear Creek Combined Sewer Basin Relief Project in the North Avenue area will\nstore water to provide relief to Atlanta's sewer system.\nc. Brownfield Remediation\nBrownfields are abandoned and potentially contaminated sites previously used for\nindustrial or commercial purposes. There are an estimated 1,100 acres of brownfields\nwithin the Atlanta BeltLine Redevelopment area, and as population continues to grow,\nthere is pressure to redevelop this land for a better use. More research must be conducted\non these pieces of land to determine the best use for them.\nC. Trails and Transit\nOne of the most important and defining aspects of the Atlanta BeltLine is the continuous\nloop of trails and transit. The construction of 22 miles of transit and more than 33 miles of\n\ntransit is meant to connect 45 neighborhoods and numerous parks. Pedestrian‐ and\nbicycle‐friendly trails will improve the health of the residents. By closing the few gaps\naround the BeltLine corridor, residents will be able to circle downtown Atlanta and follow\nother trails that connect to the rest of the city. Similarly, new transit, either light rail or\nstreet cars, and three new MARTA stations will quickly connect residents to other parts\nalong the BeltLine corridor and the existing rails that extend out from the city. The trails\nare being designed with the help of the PATH Foundation to link racially, socio‐\neconomically, and culturally diverse neighborhoods, and \"to develop a system of\ninterlinking greenway trails through metro Atlanta for commuting and recreating.\"ix\nD. Other\na. Sidewalks and Streets\nIn addition to continuous transit and trails, the development of pedestrian‐friendly\nsidewalks and intersections are imperative to the walkability of the city and the safety of\nthe residents. The goal is to create a more cohesive urban street network and reduce the\ncity's dependency on automobiles by providing easy, walkable, and aesthetically‐pleasing\naccess to the BeltLine.\nb. Historic Preservation\nThe historic preservations of Atlanta's intown shopping districts and iconic homes\ncontribute not only to the tourism industry, but the character of the city. Many historic\ndistricts have guidelines to accommodate the BeltLine and to limit the space for parking\ngarages in an effort to preserve the pre‐automobile era that represents most of the\nresidential and commercial districts.\nc. Public Art\nThe purpose of public art is to promote creativity and community along the BeltLine.\n\"Art of the BeltLine\" is an initiative to invite local artists to contribute to the BeltLine, and it\nis the largest temporary art project in the history of Atlanta.\nd. Affordable Housing\nIn order to protect low‐income households from increasing property taxes as\ndevelopment continues, a portion of the BeltLine's financing is devoted to developing\n\naffordable housing. As development starts and jobs are created, there will be a demand for\naffordable housing that will be satisfied by developing Community Land Trusts (CLTs).\nIII. Project Financing\nAs a large‐scale project, the BeltLine requires funding from many sources, in both the\npublic and private sectors. The three main sources of funding are the BeltLine Tax\nAllocation District (TAD), a Capital Campaign and Federal Funding. In addition, the City of\nAtlanta has allocated funds outside of the TAD for the project. These sources of funding\nvary in size and cover different aspects of the project. Table 1 shows a summary of the\ntotal anticipated costs and general funding sources.\n\nTable 1: Total Anticipated Costs and General Funding Sources. Source: Atlanta BeltLine\nTAD Feasibility Study\nA. BeltLine Tax Allocation District\nAs seen in Table 1, it is expected that nearly 70% of the financing for the Atlanta\nBeltLine project will come from the creation of the BeltLine Tax Allocation District. Called\nTax Increment Financing (TIF) in other states, a TAD diverts a portion of property tax\nrevenue from collecting agencies in order to finance a new project that will add to the\noverall tax base. The associated government entities (such as city, county and school\ndistrict) continue to collect property tax revenue at a base level determined by the tax base\nat the time of the TAD creation.\nThe BeltLine TAD was established December 31, 2005 and runs until December 31,\n2030, or until the bond issuances have been paid off. Funding for the project is\ndependent on future development in the designated TAD area.\nTable of anticipated costs and\nfunding sources for the\nAtlanta BeltLine project.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nFigure 6 shows the BeltLine TAD boundaries. The boundaries include non‐single family\nresidential lots within the BeltLine corridor. The TAD crosscuts the nearly 50\nneighborhoods that will be affected by the BeltLine project. While waiting for development\nto occur, the project funding will be generated through the sales of bonds. When bonds are\nsold through the local government, the local government can designate future tax revenue\nfrom the TAD to service the debt. The issuance of bonds for the BeltLine will be phased\nover the life of the project. It is important to know that the bonds are not backed by tax\npayers, but rather by the tax increment from the TADv.\nThe estimated schedule of bond issuances is listed in Table 2, and shown as a cash flow\nin Figure 7. This schedule is based on estimated private development activity within the\nBeltLine corridor. In the early years of the project, it is very likely that BeltLine expenses\nwill exceed BeltLine revenues, particularly due to land and right‐of‐way acquisitions.\nHowever, over the life of the project the revenue will increase as development is brought\ninto the area.\n\nTable 2: Projected Timing and Range of Amounts of Bondsv\nTabl\ne of\ntim\ning\nand\namou\nnt\nof bond issu\nances.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nFigure 6: BeltLine Tax Allocation Districts.

Capital Campaign\nThe Atlanta BeltLine Partnership, a non‐profit organization that works with the Atlanta\nBeltLine Inc., works to raise awareness and funds for the BeltLine and to catalyze\ncommunity resources to address the social concerns of the project. In 2007, they created a\n$60 Million Capital Campaign to help achieve the goals of the Five‐Year Work Plan, which\nran from 2006 to 2010. To date, the capital campaign has raised $35.7 million from more\nthan 100 donors. These private funds were used to fund land acquisition and trail\nconstruction and are essential to the public‐private partnership model for which the\nBeltLine strivesx.\nC. Federal Funding\nFederal funding for the BeltLine will be directed through several specific programs.\nFunding is already underway for right‐of‐way acquisition and trail construction. The\nAtlanta Regional Commission has marked $18 million for these purposes through the\nTransportation Improvement Plan (TIP). In addition, the ARC long term plan, the Regional\nTransportation Plan, has committed $240 million in funding for transit.\nThe federal government has earmarked $1 million in funding to support the\npreliminary engineering portion of transit development. Down the line, the ABI will apply\nfor federal transit funds via the federal New Starts or Small Starts programs. The New\nStarts program \"is the federal government's primary financial resource for supporting\nlocally‐planned, implemented, and operated transit 'guideway' capital investments\"xi. The\n\nSmall Starts program funds smaller projects that cost less than $250 million and require\nless than $75 million in federal funding. While the entire BeltLine project would not qualify\nfor Small Starts, portions of the project may.\nAdditional federal funding is expected to come through Federal matching programs for\npedestrian and roadway improvements, as well as for trail construction. Atlanta has\nreceived federal funding in the past for trail constructions and expects to continue doing so.\nIn addition, the status of the BeltLine as a transformative urban project may lead to\nopportunities for additional federal funding from a government interested in the project's\nscope and scalexii.\nIV. Current Status of Project\nA. Green space and Trails\nABI has purchased over 200 acres of land, as well as 50% of the 22‐mile loop that will\ncomprise the transit right‐of‐way.xiii They have also purchased the Bellwood Quarry, which\nwill be developed into the largest drinking water reservoir in Atlanta, in addition to a\nrecreation area. The development of three parks has been completed, including the\nHistoric Fourth Ward Park. Phase I of the park, the development of the Clear Creek\nCombined Sewer Basic Relief Project and other park amenities on five acres in the North\nAvenue area, was completed in February 2011. Several parks are also currently under\nconstruction, including the expansion of Stanton Park in Peoplestown, Boulevard Crossing\nPark, and the Westside Reservoir Park. These parks, along with others, will comprise the\n13 \"jewels\" of the \"BeltLine Emerald Necklace\".\nIn addition to the new green space, the first section of trail has been completed. The\nWest End Trail, a 12 foot wide, 2.3 mile multi‐use concrete trail connecting three parks\nalong the corridor, was completed in 2010.xiv With community and commercial support,\nthis accomplishment is an important step toward bicycle and pedestrian connectivity that\nwill test the overall cohesiveness and quality of the BeltLine. Its development also includes\nan upgrade for the Gordon White Park. The trail was funded and planned by the PATH\nFoundation, along with the Department of Planning and Community Development (DPCD).\n\nLand acquisition is expected to be completed over the next 5‐10 years, and park\ndevelopment will ramp up over the same time period.\nB. Rights of Way\nAtlanta BeltLine, Inc. has currently secured about 50% of the rights‐of‐way for the\nproject, but has yet to negotiate terms with CSX. CSX owns the rail in the northwest\nquadrant of the BeltLine corridor and still operates the Seaboard Air Line Railroad.\nAlthough there is heavy use of the corridor as freight rail, this does not necessarily\npreclude sharing the right‐of‐way with light rail transit. CSX shares its right of way with\ntransit in other locations around the country, including other MARTA lines within Atlanta.\nAccording to Ryan Gravel, however, this will come at a cost.\nC. Transit\nAt this point in the project, the Atlanta BeltLine Initiative has secured construction\npermission from the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), and the Tier 1\nEnvironmental Impact Statement was completed in the summer of 2010. A Tier 1 EIS\ndefines more precisely the right‐of‐way for transit and trails in the BeltLine Corridorxv.\nThe EIS analyzes the socio‐economic impacts of \"building transit and trail facilities in the\n22‐mile BeltLine corridor\"x. There are still 5 points along the rail corridor that do not\nconnect; however, the first section of transit is expected to be built by 2014, based on a\nconversation with James Alexander, a senior project manager with Atlanta BeltLine, Inc.\nThe next step for building transit is securing financing, some of which will come from the\nTAD, and some may come from federal funding programs described above.\nD. Financing\nTwo rounds of BeltLine bonds have been issued, totaling $355,663,555. These bonds\nhave been used to finance the initial Five‐year Work Plan and will also be used to begin\nconstruction of transit. In addition to TAD funding, the BeltLine capital campaign has\nraised $35.7 million dollars to date. Finally, because the Tier I EIS is near completion, ABI\ncan begin the application process for federal funds for transit from the New Starts and\nSmall Starts programs.\n\nE. Affordable Housing\nThirty‐five development projects have already been announced or are under\nconstruction, including 6,600 housing units and over 1.3 million acres of retail and office\nspace. The BeltLine Partnership is focusing on determining the viability of CLTs to create\npermanent affordable housing. They are beginning to develop partnerships with local\nleaders and national organizations to determine how CLTs will most benefit Atlanta. In\naddition, they are reaching out to homeowners who are at risk of being displaced and\ncreating a resource guide to direct them to the non‐profit and governmental agencies that\ncan assist them.\nV. CostBenefit Analysis\nA. Costs\nThe total estimated cost of the project according to the Atlanta Development Authority\nwas between $1.8‐$2.4 billion over the 25 year life of the TAD. However, our detailed\nestimations place the cost at $4.1 billion over the 25 years of the project, including\noperation and maintenance costs, which are excluded from the ADA estimation. Assuming\na discount rate of 8%, however, the NPV of these costs in 2006 dollars is $1.48 billion. A\ndiscount rate of 8% is used because it is 0.5% higher than the interest rate for the bonds\nfinancing the project. Figure 8 shows the total cost of the project in 2006 dollars, and\nFigure 9 shows the cost broken down by component. Table 3 shows the cost breakdown\nfor the project.\nThis analysis includes only the monetary costs of the project, such as construction and\noperations and maintenance; the non‐monetary costs of the project, including\ngentrification and economic displacement, are very abstract and there have previously\nbeen no studies done to quantify the economic cost of gentrification. In addition, many of\nthe costs are variable and unknown. Construction costs over the 25 year life of the project\nare dependent on the economic climate. In addition, costs such as brownfield remediation\nare unknown until analyses are done on formerly industrial lots of land.\n\nFigure 8: Total Cost of the Atlanta BeltLine in 2006 dollars\n\nFigure 9: Total project costs by component.\n\nParks and Trails\n\nAcquisition\n$470,000,000.00\n\nDevelopment\n$330,000,000.00\n\nPublic Art\n$6,000,000.00\nDevelopment\n\nWorkforce Housing\n$260,000,000.00\n\nIncentives\n$32,000,000.00\n\nBrownfield Testing\n$20,000,000.00\n\nTransportation/Pedestrian Access\n$270,000,000.00\nTransit\n\nConstruction\n$1,250,000,000.00\nRights of Way\n$178,000,000.00\nAtlanta Public Schools\n$95,000,000.00\nProject Support Costs\n$137,000,000.00\nContingency\n$40,000,000.00\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\nParks\n$790,614,000.00\n\nTrails\n$825,000.00\n\nTransit\n$383,724,000.00\n\nTotal Cost=\n$4,263,163,000.00\nNPV Cost=\n(8% discount rate)\n$1,566,182,271.22\nTable 3: Cost breakdown for the Atlanta BeltLine project\ni. Quantifying Costs\nThe costs of many components of the project were taken from the estimations given in\nthe Atlanta BeltLine Redevelopment Report, and then dispersed over the final twenty years\nof the project. The costs for the first five years of the project, which was completed in 2010,\nare published and were used in this analysis. In addition, it was assumed that all park land\nto be developed would be acquired by 2020, all rights‐of‐way would be acquired by 2015,\nand brownfield testing would be completed by 2016.\n\nThe capital costs considered for the project can be seen in Table 4:\nParks and Trails\n\nAcquisition\n\nDevelopment\n\nPublic Art\nDevelopment\n\nWorkforce Housing\n\nIncentives\n\nBrownfield Testing\n\nTransportation/Pedestrian\nAccess\nTransit\n\nConstruction\nRights of Way\nAtlanta Public Schools\nProject Support Costs\nContingency\nTable 4: Capital Costs Included in Analysis\nThe Atlanta Development Authority failed to include operation and maintenance costs\nin its cost estimation. Although these costs will continue past the life of the TAD and will\ncome from a separate funding source, it is very important to understand the scale of these\ncosts for new development of parks, trails and transit.\nThe annual maintenance of urban green space was estimated to be $1.50 per square\nfootxvi. At a final estimation of 1,300 acres of new park space, the maintenance cost for the\nnew green space at the end of the project will be $90.16 million annually. The development\nof new park space over the 25 years of the project was estimated with a scaling increase as\nthe project continues, but the total green space maintenance costs over the life of the\nproject will total $790.6 million in addition to the construction and acquisition costs. The\nmaintenance of asphalt trails was estimated to be $2,500 per mile per yearxvii. The BeltLine\nproject aims to build 33 miles of new trails; in year 30, the annual maintenance costs of the\ntrails will total $70,000.\nIn order to calculate the maintenance costs of a new light rail line in Atlanta, it was\nnecessary to compare the system with an existing light rail system. The chosen comparison\nwas with the Portland Tri‐Met system. Although currently larger than the Atlanta BeltLine\n\nwill be, it shares similar characteristics. A description of the comparison of the two\nsystems and the calculations for the annual operating expenses can be found in Appendix B.\nThe annual operating expense for the final 20 mile loop of light rail transit will be $45.1\nmillion dollars.\nB. Benefits\nNo benefit analysis has yet been conducted for this project, as many of the benefits have\nbeen assumed and strongly supported by the public. This report focuses on quantifying\nthree key benefits: the development of parks, additional local transit, and an increased tax\nbase. The goal is to quantify enough of the benefits to justify the costs of the redevelopment\nof the Atlanta BeltLine. The total estimated benefits are about $8.4 billion; however, these\nbenefits are dominated by the increased tax base that is anticipated at the end of the\nproject. Assuming a discount rate of 8%, the NPV of the benefits in 2006 dollars is $1.3\nbillion. The values for each benefit are detailed in Table 5.\nParks\n\nProperty Value\n$ 155,339,043.33\n\nDirect Use\n$ 91,290,129.97\nTransit\n\nRevenue from Fares\n$ 75,706,513.59\nIncreased Tax Base\n$ 8,081,636,552.00\nTotal Cost =\n$ 8,403,972,238.89\nNPV Cost =\n(8% discount rate)\n$ 1,307,861,993.63\nTable 5: Benefits Included in Analysis\ni. Quantifying Benefits\nThe quantified benefits in this report were modeled after other investigations. Still,\nmany were difficult to quantify because there is a lot of uncertainty in values such as the\nrate of development and the amount and demographics park visitors. The benefits used in\nthis analysis, excluding development benefits represented by the increased tax base are\nshown in Figure 10.\n\nTotal Benefits excluding development benefits\nYear\nAmount ($ millions)\nDirect Use of P arks\nIncrease in P roperty Value due to P arks\nTransit R evenue\nFigure 10: Total project benefits by component, excluding development benefits.\nThe property value and direct use benefits of additional parkland were calculated using\ncase studies from \"Measuring the Economic Value of a City Park System\", conducted by the\nTrust for Public Land. Based on this study and data from the 2000 census, the average\nproperty value of a housing unit within 500ft of a park is 15% higher. Ignoring future\ninflation, we predict an additional $155 million in property value due to the development\nof p\n\narkland by 2030. The NPV in 2006 dollars is $46.89 million.\nWe modeled the direct use value of Atlanta BeltLine's proposed interconnected park\nsystem after the Boston Emerald Necklace. Based on the study conducted by the Trust for\nPublic Land, three park activities; general use, sports facilities use, and special use, are\nassigned a monetary value per visit. Assuming the number of visitors per use scales linearly\nwith park acreage, we calculated the total value per acre to be $70,223.18, therefore, the\ndirect use value of the additional 1300 acres is about $91.3 million, and the NPV in 2006\ndollars is $62.13 million.\nThe benefits of increased transit were evaluated as the increased revenue due to\nadditional miles of rail. The increase in passengers was estimated using data from the\nPortland Tri‐met case, and we assumed that about a quarter of the total miles of transit will\nbe developed every five years, for a total of 22 miles developed between 2014 and 2030.\nThe predicted annual passenger‐miles are 103,530,275, and the average rail fare is $1.50,\nso the total revenue is about $75.7 million; the NPV in 2006 dollars is $18.78 million. For\nmore detailed descriptions of the calculations using GIS and other estimates, see Appendix\nC.\n\nLastly, the value for the increase in the tax base in 2030 due to the TAD, is $8.08 billion.\nThi value is estimated..... BECCA\ns\n\nThe NPV of this value in 2006 dollars is $1.18 billion, which is much greater than the\nother calculated benefits, as shown in Figure 11.\nC. Unknown NonMonetary Costs and Benefits\nAs mentioned earlier, gentrification and brownfield remediation are difficult to quantify\nat this stage of the project. However, the costs evaluated in this report represent the\nmajority of the costs associated with the redevelopment of the BeltLine. Likewise, many of\nthese benefits are difficult to quantify. There are numerous additional benefits to this\nproject, including improved walkability and health, improved intra‐urban connectively\nthrough transit‐oriented development, decreased traffic congestion, the development of\npedestrian‐ and bicycle‐friendly trails, job creation during construction and for\nmaintenance, more affordable housing, community development, decreased blight, storm\nwater management, and public art. Although these benefits will have positive social and\nenvironmental, there is no reliable way to quantify them. Since there is such strong public\nsupport behind the BeltLine, there has not been a need for a detailed benefit analysis;\nhowever one is anticipated when the development of transit is started.\nD. Comparison of Costs and Benefits\nWhile the total NPV cost of the project in 2006 dollars is $1.57 billion dollars, slightly\nhigher than the calculated NPV benefits of $1.3 billion, these numbers are close enough to\nwarrant an appraisal that the benefits and costs of the project are roughly equivalent. If all\nthe benefits listed above in Section C would be considered, we are confident that the\nbenefits of the Atlanta BeltLine far outweigh the costs.\nFigure 11 shows the cash flow for the project, including the costs and benefits listed\nabove. The benefit of the increased tax base, which represents the benefit of future\ndevelopment, is the most significant benefit associated with the project and is the benefit in\nthis analysis that equalizes the costs and benefits. This unique financing scheme not only\nallows the project to occur, but also it also makes it beneficial to society.\n\nFigure 11: Cost‐Benefit Analysis, discounted back to 2006\n\nVI. Conclusions and Recommendations\nAlthough this cost‐benefit analysis shows that the costs slightly outweigh the benefits,\nthe additional social benefits make this project worthwhile, and the increased tax base\nmakes it economically feasible. Likewise, there are many uncertainties in the values we\nused, and small adjustments could alter the final numbers.\nThe BeltLine Redevelopment project shows how TADs, or TIFs, can finance major urban\nprojects without overburdening taxpayers. Additionally, although social benefits are\ndifficult to quantify, they drive public opinion, and public support and input are crucial to\nensuring the completion of redevelopment projects. Likewise, this project represents the\nimportance of transit‐oriented and environmentally‐conscious planning. Assuming the\nBeltLine is successful, this project will be an example for major urban redevelopment\nprojects\n\nAppendices\nA. Project Financing--Becca\nInclude information about the calculations in the increase in the tax base from the\nB. Costs\nIn order to calculate the maintenance cost of the BeltLine light rail transit, it was necessary\nto look for a similar transit system elsewhere in the country. The comparison that was\nchosen was the Portland Transit System. This system was chosen because of its\ncomprehensive and progressive nature, as well as the similarities in the type and size of the\nservice area and population to that of Atlanta. In order to estimate the annual operating\ncosts of the light system, a comparison was drawn between the Portland system in 1996, in\nits infancy, and the current BeltLine transit system. Table 6 shows the comparison of the\ntwo systems.\nThe transit data for the Portland Tri‐Met system was found from the National Transit\nDatabase. Although data was compiled for multiple years, it was deemed that the 1996 was\nthe most relevant. The operating expense per vehicle revenue mile in 1996 was $12, and\nhas stayed relatively consistent over the past 15 years, decreasing slightly to $10.97 in the\nmid 200s and then increasing again to $13.22. Thus $12 was used as the operating expense\nper vehicle revenue mile in the analysis of the Atlanta BeltLine.\nThe total annual vehicle revenue miles for the Atlanta BeltLine were estimated based on\nthe fixed guideway directional route miles, the estimated number of vehicles traveling the\nroute and the time of operation. The BeltLine transit will be a 20 mile loop, so there will be\n40 fixed guideway directional route miles. The headway for the vehicles is assumed to be 4\nmin, a conservative estimate, so there will be 15 cars per hour. It is assumed that it will\ntake 60 minutes for the 20 mile loop given the distance and number of stops, so there will\nbe 15 cars operating in each direction, for a total fleet of 30 vehicles. Each vehicle will\ncomplete the loop once per hour. MARTA currently runs its trains from 6am to 1am, for a\ntotal operation time of 19 hours. It is assumed that the vehicles will operate 360 days per\n\nyear, providing a buffer for maintenance etc. Therefore the annual vehicle revenue miles\nare:\niles\n30 vehicles x 20 miles per hour x 19 hours per day x 360 days per year= 4,104,000 m\nBased on the operating expense per vehicle revenue mile of $11, the total operating\nexpense for a 20 mile BeltLine system is $45,144,000 annually for the complete system.\nCity\nPortland Tri‐Met\nAtlanta BeltLine\nYear\nService Population\n1,172,159\n1,574,600\nService Area (sq. miles)\nOperating Expense\n$18,406,745\n$45,144,000\nAnnual Vehicle Revenue Miles\n1,533,463\nFixed Guideway Directional Route\nMiles\nTotal Fleet\nOperating Expe\nRevenue Mile\nnse per Vehicle\n$10.97\n$11\nTable 6: Comparison of Portland and Atlanta transit systems\nBased on conversation with James Alexander, a senior project manager with Atlanta\nBeltLine, Inc, the first section of transit is expected to be opened by 2014. It is assumed\nthat this section will be 5 miles and compose 1⁄4 of the total length. The remaining three\nsections are assumed to be built consecutively, each composing 5 miles and each taking\napproximately 4 years to construct.\nC. Benefits\nUsing ArcGIS and 2000 census data, it is possible to evaluate the increase of average\nproperty values within 500ft of a park. In 2000, the average property value in Atlanta was\n$158,568.34, but the average property value around local parks was $184,746.22, a 16.5%\nincrease. The study conducted by the Trust for Public Land predicts a similar increase of\n15%, so this value is used in the calculations. The amount of parkland added each year\nstarting in 2010 is incrementally increased until 2030, assuming more development will\nramp up over time, for a total addition of 1300 acres of parkland. During this time, the\nnumber of housing units per acre will increase as development increases. Based on\n\nannounced development, the average housing unit density will is estimated to increase\nfrom 2.835 to 3.06 housing units per acre. Assuming the parks are roughly circular, and\nafter inflating housing values from 2000 to 2010 dollars, the value of parks due to the\nincrease in property value they cause is about $155 million, ignoring future inflation.\nTo calculate the direct use benefit of the additional 1300 acres of parkland, we modeled\nthe Atlanta BeltLine's proposed interconnected park system after the Boston Emerald\nNecklace. The average value per visit for three park facilities/activities, or \"Unit Day Value\"\nmethod used in the Trust for Public Land's study was developed by the US Army Corps of\nEngineers; general park use, such as playgrounds, trails, and picnicking, is assigned $1.91\nper visit, sports facilities use is assigned $3.05 per visit, and special uses, such as golfing,\nfestivals, and gardening, are assigned $9.33 per visit. The number of person‐visits to the\nBoston Emerald Necklace was drawn from a telephone survey of 600 Boston residents;\nhowever, the proposed BeltLine \"necklace\" is much smaller in area. Assuming the number\nof visitors per use scales linearly with park acreage, we calculated the total value per acre\nto be $70,223.18, and using the same rate of park development when calculating the\nincrease in property value, we find that the direct use value of the additional 1300 acres is\nabout $91.3 million, and the NPV in 2006 dollars is $62.13 million.\nThe benefits of increased transit were evaluated as the increased revenue due to\nadditional miles of rail. The increase in passengers was estimated using data from the\nPortland Tri‐met case, and we assumed that about a quarter of the total miles of transit will\nbe developed every five years, for a total of 22 miles developed between 2014 and 2030.\nThe predicted annual passenger‐miles are 103,530,275, and the average rail fare is $1.50,\nso the total revenue is about $75.7 million; the NPV in 2006 dollars is $18.78 million.

      "content": "Spring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\nJoe Sussman\nThe Tsunami That Wasn't\n\nJ. Sussman March 7, 2010\n\nWe recently wrote about the snowstorm that ―never happened‖ in New England. The\npredictions were for substantial snow, but those predictions proved wrong and only rain\nor very light snow occurred in much of the region. The perspective of the meteorologists\nin the area was, ―sorry we missed it - these things happen.‖ The previous note discussed\nhow a deviation in track of a few miles - not that big a mistake - could create\nsubstantially different outcomes on the ground where it matters to people (stakeholders, if\nyou will).\n\nNow we have just had a major earthquake, 8.8 on the Richter scale, in Chile. This is\namong the biggest earthquakes recorded in history. One of the after-effects of\nearthquakes can be the development of devastating tsunamis, which can wreak havoc\naround the globe, thousands of miles away. With an earthquake this large, there was real\nconcern about what might happen in the Pacific basin, including places like Guam, the\nstate of Hawaii, and even Japan. The authorities made predictions of a substantial\ntsunami but, in a similar outcome to the New England snowstorm, those very strong\ntsunamis did not develop; rather, much more modest waves were felt, creating virtually\nno problems in the affected communities.\n\nWhat was different here were the comments of the scientists who had made the tsunami\nprediction. They expressed regret for the ―false alarm,‖ but went on to say they now\nunderstood why that tsunami was less intense than predicted and they were going to\n―change their models‖ of tsunami behavior and expected to do better in the future. I\nheard no such commentaries from the meteorologists in the Boston situation--they\nregretted the poor prediction but didn't talk about what they had learned and how they\nwould try to do better in the future, although I grant I could have missed it.\n\nThese different reactions may reflect the state of the art of prediction in these two\ndomains. Perhaps with tsunamis we are still learning at a fundamental level what drives\nthe intensity of the tsunami, while perhaps in the case of snowstorms our models have\nreached the point where more instantiations will do very little to allow us to make better\npredictions. One could say (maybe) that in the case of snowstorms, we have reached the\npoint of ―irreducible uncertainty‖. It would be interesting to ask some domain experts in\nthe two fields.\n\nI imagine in the case both of snowstorms and the tsunamis that the predictors are risk-\naverse. They would rather make predictions that are too severe, allowing people to\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\nJoe Sussman\nprepare for the worst, as opposed to missing on the low side with the snowstorm and\ntsunami being bigger than the predictions.\n\nAnother point on tsunamis: I wonder when we first hypothesized the relationship between\ntsunamis and earthquakes and were able to empirically link a particular earthquake with a\ncorresponding tsunami. One can have ―local‖ tsunamis, in the vicinity of the earthquake;\nthis happened in the Chile earthquake. So we have known that for some time.\n\nBut what about a tsunami occurring a substantial distance from the epicenter of the\nearthquake? In 2010, we are able to pass on tsunami warnings in real-time around the\nglobe when an earthquake happens. 200 years ago, the warning would have been\nimpossible, and even the linking of an earthquake in Chile to a tsunami in Japan, after the\nfact, would have been quite difficult given the period of time between an earthquake in\nChile and news of the earthquake reaching Japan - on the scale perhaps of months after a\ntsunami generated by that earthquake had occurred. Someone would have had to\n―remember‖ a tsunami occurred in Japan some hours later than the earthquake occurred\nback in Chile.

      "content": "How Little Mistakes Can Lead to Big Differences in Outcomes: The Weather\nJ. Sussman\nFebruary 25, 2010\nThis is a highly simplified view of a complex physical phenomenon--a winter storm--\nintended to provide some lessons in why little mistakes in predicting events can lead to\nbig differences in outcomes that people care about. It was \"inspired\" by the snowstorm\nthat recently did not happen in the Boston Metro area.\nIn mid-February, a large storm front was approaching Boston, leading to dire forecasts of\nheavy snow, in turn leading to many event cancellations and school closings. I live 17\nmiles west of the city and instead of a snowstorm ended up with a dusting of less than\n1⁄2\". In Boston itself, the streets were merely wet. So let's see how this \"mistake\"\nhappened.\nConsider the following diagram. It shows a hypothetical storm track (the vertical line)\npassing some distance M from my home at L.\nM\nL\nStorm track\nWe know M is a random variable which, let us assume, we can characterize by a\nprobability density function (pdf). We also know that the pdf changes over time. As the\nstorm approaches, we usually can be more confident about M, so the pdf will exhibit less\nvariance. But let's not worry about that.\nƒ(M)\nM*=E(M)\nM\nM*\n\nNow let's further assume we know the relationship between M and the amount of snow D\nthat my home sees. Again, we recognize this is a gross oversimplification. The snowfall\nwill change as the storm parameters change (intensity which is a function of time,\nvelocity of the storm--the slower it is, the more snow falls--, and doubtless other\nfactors).\nD\n|M|\nSuppose the prediction for the storm track is M* from my house. Likely, the\nmeteorologist would use the mean value of M - i.e. M* for that guess. This means the\nprediction for snow depth is D*, in this instance 12\". But suppose the storm shifts and the\nactual value (instantiation) of M is M**\nSo the actual snowfall is D**; in the instance of the storm that lead to this note, D** is a\nmuch smaller number than the predicted amount, like just about zero!\nOn National Public Radio the next day, the indication was that the meteorologists missed\nthe storm track by about 40-50 miles. In the grand scheme, maybe that is a pretty good\nprediction--the \"little mistake\" in the title of this note. Maybe the meteorologists were\npopping bottles of champagne to celebrate how close their prediction had come to the\nactual track. But if D* is 12\" and D** is about zero, that is a pretty big difference in\noutcomes as observed by the \"stakeholders,\" such as people being impacted by the storm\nand making plans based on the predictions.\nNow it can work the other way too, of course. There have been occasions when I have\nshoveled 12\" of \"snow flurries after midnight\" off my driveway the next morning.\nSo why can't we make better predictions? Well, that's a story for another day.\nD\nD*\nD**\nM*\nM** |M|\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.011 Project Evaluation\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Spring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\n\nJoe Sussman\n1.011 Uncertainty Note\nDid Belichick Make the Right Call?\nJ. Sussman\nFebruary 19, 2010\n\nBack in November, 2009, Coach Bill Belichick (BB) of the New England Patriots made a highly\ncontroversial decision late in a game with the Indianapolis Colts. The Pats had the ball on their\nown 29-yard line with a 4th and 2 with only 2 minutes or so to go in the game. BB had two\noptions. The conventional choice would have been to punt the ball to the Colts. In that case, the\nColts would have had the ball on their own 30 (or so), 70 yards from the winning touchdown. If\nthe Pats went for the first down, and made it, they would retain possession and be able to run out\nthe clock and win. If they didn't, the Colts would take over on the Pats 29, 29 yards away from\nthe winning touchdown.\nBB went for the first down and failed to make it. The Colts took over and scored a touchdown\nwinning the game. Belichick was castigated by the fans and the press for his ―mistake‖. BB is\nwidely perceived as a coaching genius. Did he just have a brain cramp? Let's think about this:\nSuppose BB's assessment of the probabilities is as follows:\nP(Pats make the first down) = P1 (in which case the Patriots win with probability = 1)\nP(Colts win if they start from the Pats 29) = P2\nP(Colts win if they start from their own 30) = P3\nHere are the decision trees.\nThey punt\nPats win with probability (1-P3)\nPats lose with probability P3\nThey try for the first down\nPats win with probability=1\nPats make first down\nwith probability P1\n\nPats lose with probability=0\n\nPats fail to make first\n\nPats win with probability (1-P2)\ndown with probability\n(1-P1)\n\nPats lose with probability P2\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\n\nJoe Sussman\nIf BB chooses to punt, the Pats' chance of winning are simply 1-P3\nIf BB tries for the first down, the Pats' chance of winning is\nP1 + (1-P1) (1-P2) = 1- P2(1-P1)\nIn this second case, they have 2 chances to win--they make the first down, in which case they\nwin with certainty or they fail to make the first down in which case, they can still win if the Colts\nfail to score from the Pats 29.\nSo I am speculating that BB felt he had a good chance to make the first down, so let's say BB\nthinks P1=0.8.\nSo, again, the Pats' chance of winning if they punt are 1-P3\nTheir chance of winning if they go for the first down are 1-P2(0.2).\nWhat should BB do?\nSo if 1-0.2(P2) > 1-P3, BB should go for the first down.\nRearranging:\nIf 0.2P2< P3, BB should go for the first down.\nSo, if for example, BB believes P2 = .7 and P3= .5, you should try for the first down\nBut if P2 = .7 and P3 = .1, you should punt.\nYou can try it for some other numbers.\nWhen fans, asked by the radio host on talk radio if they thought BB had made the right or wrong\ndecision--in the real situation, they went for the first down--- they would say things like\n―Obviously, it was the wrong decision. They didn't make it and lost the game, didn't they?‖ That\ndoesn't prove it was a bad decision, anymore than it would prove it was a good decision if the\nPats made the first down, thereby winning the game.\nThe point is that the outcome of this one-time event doesn't tell us whether it was a good\ndecision or not. However, it may cause BB to reevaluate his expert estimates of P1, P2 and P3.\nNow, on a more serious note, consider the snowstorms that brought Washington to a standstill.\nSome people were saying ―it looks like global cooling, not global warming is going on‖. Just as\nBB wasn't wrong simply because his strategy didn't work that one time, a big snowstorm in\nWashington doesn't tell us anything about climate change. And to be even handed, the folks out\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\n\nJoe Sussman\nin Vancouver for the Winter Olympics who are saying the unusually warm temperatures are\nevidence of global warming are equally incorrect. One instantiation tells us very little.\nBack to football--my own sense of this is that BB felt Peyton Manning, the Colts quarterback,\nhad a very good chance to drive the Colts to a winning touchdown whether the Colts started on\nthe Pats' 29 or their own 30. Manning was playing very well, and the Pats defense seemed\nbushed. Let's say BB thought P2 = .8 and P3 = .6\nIn this case, the chances of the Pats winning if they punt is .4\nThe chances the Pats win if they go for it = 1-.8 (1-P1), so if BB believes his chances of making\nthe first down is > .25, he should go for it.\nI personally think it was the right call, but as Mrs. Albert Einstein supposedly said about her\nhusband, ―Ah, what does he know?‖\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\n\nJoe Sussman\nBelichick - Part 2\nJ.Sussman March 10, 2010\n\nNow, suppose our question is a different one. We now want to predict what decision BB (or\nsome other coach) will make before the fact. Let us assume we are all agreed on the values of P1,\nP2 and P3 to take that out of the mix.\n\nBut let's add in another twist--call it the embarrassment factor. Football coaches often make the\ndecision that will avoid embarrassment rather than the decision that gives them the best chance\nto win.\n\nIn this instance, the conventional decision would be to punt. Almost no-one would criticize a\ncoach who punted even if the team lost.\n\nNow BB is interested only in winning and doesn't care about embarrassment. So the earlier\ndecision trees applies. But suppose we have a less confident coach (LC). He cares only about\navoiding embarrassment and not at all about winning. In this case, the coach would always punt,\nunless s/he is certain that the Patriots will make the first down (P1=1)\n\nA more general approach is the following:\n\nEach result on our decision trees now has two outcomes:\n\nDid the Patriots win? If they win, W=1 and if not W=0\nIs the coach embarrassed by the outcome? If embarrassed, E= -1 and if not E=0\n\nNow BB doesn't worry about embarrassment--only winning--and LC really wants to avoid\nembarrassment at all costs--if s/he wins, fine--but first and foremost s/he wants not to be\nembarrassed! So we know how to solve the BB case and the LC case too. But consider a more\nnuanced coach who balances winning and embarrassment. Let w be the weight Coach NN (for\nnuanced) places on winning and e be the weight NN places on embarrassment, where\n\nw+e =1\n\nSo for BB, w=1 and e=0\nFor LC, w=0 and e=1\n\nLet's now do our decision trees again and calculate the value of each outcome, using W, E and\nthe weights w and e.\n\nHere are the decision trees.\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\n\nJoe Sussman\n\nThe choice is punt\n\nHere are the decision trees.\n\nThey punt\n\nW E V=Ww+Ee\n\nPats win with probability (1-P3) 1 0 w\n\nPats lose with probability P3 0 0 0\n\nThe value (V) of this strategy is simply as follows:\n\nV*=w (1-P3)\n\nNote there is no embarrassment! How could there be? They took the conventional choice\n\nThe choice is to try for the first down.\n\nHere are the decision trees\n\nW E V=[Ww+Ee]\n\nPats win with probability=1 1 0 w\nPats make first down\nwith probability P1\nPats lose with probability=0 0 0 0\n\nPats win with probability 1 0\nw\nPats fail to make first (1-P2)\ndown with probability\nPats lose with probability 0 -1 -e\n(1-P1) P2\n\nIn this case,,\n\nV**= w(P1) + w (1-P1)(1-P2) + (-e)(1-P1)(P2)\n\nThe third term shows embarrassment coming into play. They tried for the first down, didn't\nmake and lost. We assume if they try for the first down, don't make it, but still win, no\nembarrassment occurs\n\nSo for NN to go for it,\nV** > V*\n\nSo let's see what P1 has to be for NN to try for the first down, as a function of P2, P3, w and e.\n\nRearranging term, we eventually obtain:\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\n\nJoe Sussman\n\nP1 > 1 - wP3\nP2\n\nas the condition for the coach going for the first down. Note that e is in this expression implicitly\nsince w + e = 1\n\nSo suppose that P2= .8 and P3= .6\n\nThen P1 > 1- .75w is the condition for trying for the first down.\n\nIf the coach is BB, w= 1 and P1> .25. So the coach who just cares about winning and cares\nnothing about embarrassment will go for the first down even with a relatively low P1.\n\nCoach LC who has an e=1 and a w=0, will punt unless s/he believes P1 = 1\n\nLet's suppose Coach NN cares about winning and embarrassment about equally, so w=.5, e= .5.\nFor Coach NN, P1 must be > .625 for him/her to go for the first down\n\nAnd if w= 2/3 (.66666...), for that coach, s/he will try if s/he thinks P1> .5, a toss-up.\n\nTry it for other values of P2 and P3 and see what happens\n\nSo, if you are interested in predicting what the coach will do in this situation, you have to know\nwhat his/her w and e are. Are we dealing with BB, LC or the many versions of NN? Beyond that,\nwe likely need to recognize that w and e will likely change for an individual over time. And\nsome of that may be unknowable to us--the coach had a fight with his star player at half time\nand is distracted. So this prediction is non-trivial.\n\nThe question of predicting what a football coach will do is not earthshaking. But other\npredictions may be more important, such as predicting what mode a traveler will choose--public\ntransit or car--or what a shipper will choose--truck or rail. Many economic models assume the\nchooser will maximize the value to him/her in making the choice and will make an\n―economically rational‖ selection. Of course, what the economist modeling the situation thinks is\neconomically rational and what the chooser decides to do can be different. In our football\nexample, if the modeler thought that all football coaches maximized the chances simply of\nwinning -- a ―rational‖ decision - they would make bad predictions of what the coach would do\nbecause they didn't recognize the coach's rationality gave some weight to embarrassment too!\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.011 Project Evaluation\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Spring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\nProf. Joseph Sussman\n\nReal Options--A Simple Illustration\n\nJ. Sussman\n\nApril 28, 2010 8 pm\n\nThe engineering life is uncertain. We often need to make decisions now that we hope will be\neffective some years from now. One approach to this conundrum is to design ―flexibility‖ into our\nprojects, hedging against future uncertainties. This sounds reasonable and it is, but it is not ―free‖.\nIncluding flexibility is our design can be costly and if it turns out not to be needed in the future, it is\nmoney down the drain. So how do we know when to design in flexibility and when not to?\nIntuitively, the more uncertain we are about the future, the more the chances are that we will need\nflexibility. ―Real Options Analysis‖ (ROA) is a method we can use to put a value on flexibility and\ndecide whether or not we should spend the resources now to hedge against future uncertainties.\n\nLet's use a simple engineering example to illustrate these ideas.\n\nIn 2010, we have three choices for building our bridge.\n\nA) We can build a bridge with one deck that costs CA.\n\nB) We can build a bridge with two decks that costs CB\n\nC) Or we can build a bridge with one deck but add structural strength such that if we decide to add a\nsecond deck, we can do so more economically than we could in case A. The cost here is CC.\n\nSo CB>CC>CA\n\nTo make our lives simple, let's suppose we can decide in 2030 and only then--20 years hence--- to\nadd a second deck if we need it.\n\nIf in 2030, we decide to add a second deck, here are the costs we would incur at that time.\nA) CAA\nB) Zero (since we already have two decks in this case)\nC) CCC\nWe would expect that CAA>CCC\n\nHere are the cash flow diagrams for the three possibilities assuming we decide in 2030 to build the\nsecond deck, either initially or in 2030. To simplify our lives we'll ignore maintenance for now.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\n2010 2030\n2010 2030 2010 2030\n\nCCC\n\nCAA\nCA\n\nCC\n\nCB\nFigure 1\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\nProf. Joseph Sussman\n\nSo if we select a discount rate r we can calculate the NPV is the three cases\n\nNPVA= -CA-CAA/(1+r)^20\n\nNPVB= -CB\n\nNPVC= -CC-CCC/(1+r)^20\n\nSo are we done? Can we simply calculate the three NPVs, choose the best one and call it a day? I\nsaid we were gong to simplify but not quite this simple! Remember for these NPVs, we have\nassumed we were going to build a second deck and perhaps in reality we will decide in 2030 we\ndon't need it. Also, we haven't accounted for the different level of service provided by the bridge to\ntravelers in the various cases. To deal with this, we have to add some further ideas.\n\nSuppose we assume LOS in any given year is inversely proportional to the\ntravel time (tt).\n\nLOS = 1/tt\n\nAlso, LOS is a function of the volume (VOL) of traffic. So as volume grows, congestion begins to\ndevelop and LOS deteriorates. Here is the characteristic relationship between LOS and VOL.\n\nFigure 2\n\nThis is the characteristic hockey stick shape well known to transportation specialists. As VOL\napproaches the capacity (CAP), LOS deteriorates sharply. Going from a VOL of 80% of CAP to\n90% of CAP can have a large detrimental effect on LOS.\n\nNow let's consider uncertainty. We know that VOL will grow over time from 2010 through 2030 -\nwhen we have a 1-time chance to add a second deck - and then through 2050 when (let's assume for\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\nProf. Joseph Sussman\n\nsimplicity) we decide to decommission the bridge. Let's assume we have two possible traffic growth\ncurves as shown, low growth with probability p and high growth with probability (1-p) a shown.\n\nFigure 3\n\nNow how would we make the decision as to whether to add the second deck in 2030. Presumably we\nwould look at the LOS in 2030 -the only time we are allowed to add a second deck -- and decide\nwhether we need more capacity. So we could have a trigger point LOS that leads us to our decision.\nLet's suppose that under the low growth scenario, we decide we don't need the second deck and\nunder the high growth scenario, we do. This is illustrated as shown in Figure 4.\n\n* Trigger LOS (permitted to build second deck only in 2030)\n\nFigure 4\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\nProf. Joseph Sussman\n\nWe don't know yet what the LOS in the high growth scenario is after 2030.\n\nSo we need to show the LOS for B when we simply built two decks in 2010. Since we have more\nCAP beginning in 2010, we have a different LOS over time, as shown in Figure 5.\n\n* Trigger LOS (permitted to build second deck only in 2030- although in this case, we have the\nsecond deck already)\nFigure 5\n\nSo now we can complete Figure 4. Under the high growth scenario from 2030 on, we have two\ndecks. So LOS from 2030 on reflects that as shown in Figure 6.\n\n* Trigger LOS (permitted to build second deck only in 2030)\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\nProf. Joseph Sussman\n\nFigure 6\n\nNow we are ready to calculate the NPVs of the three cases, under both the low growth and high\ngrowth scenarios. We incorporate the LOSs by using the NPV provided by each of the cases by\nconsidering case B in which we have two decks from 2010 forward as the ―base case‖. So two decks\nfrom 2010 may be ―overbuilding‖ but we will may still get some value through improved LOS\nanyway. And costs due to a poorer LOS because you built only one deck initially must be\nconsidered.\n\nFigure 7\n\nN.B. In the high growth scenario, when we start in 2010 with one deck, in 2030 we build a second\ndeck\nFigure 8\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\nProf. Joseph Sussman\n\nSo we have an ―LOS deficit‖ relative to the two deck case for both low growth and high growth. In\nthe case of high growth, the deficit goes only until 2030, because we then build a second deck,\neliminating the deficit. In the low growth case, the deficit extends until 2050 because we never build\nthe second deck.\n\nNow we re-plot Figure 1 but this time including LOS costs which are calculated from the LOS deficits by\nchoosing a value of time and weighing it by the volumes in each year for which there is a deficit.\n\nFigure 9 - CASE A\n\nFigure 10 - CASE B\n\nFigure 11 - CASE C\n\nNow finally the picture emerges.\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\nProf. Joseph Sussman\n\nWe can build two decks in 2010 at a higher capital cost but have no LOS costs throughout the forty\nyears for either the low or high traffic growth case because it is the base case. (Case B)\n\nOr we can build one deck with no provision for a second deck. In this case, you have LOS costs\nthroughout the forty-year period in the low growth case (pr=p) or LOS costs for the first twenty\nyears only in the high growth case (pr=1-p). You incur construction costs of CC in 2030 to build the\nsecond deck. (Case A)\n\nOr we can spend more money in 2010 to create structural strength in case we want to build a second\ndeck in 2030. In the low growth case that additional cost (CC-CA) is ―wasted‖ since we never build\nthe second deck. But, in the high growth case, we do build the second deck, and our costs in 2030\nare CCC which is less than CAA. The LOS costs in A and C are identical. You are trading off\nspending an additional (CC-CA) in 2010 for spending (CAA-CCC) less in 2030. But again,\nrecognize we have ―wasted‖ (CC-CA) in the low growth scenario. (Case C)\n\nSo what should we do? This depends on the probability of low vs. high growth\n(p vs. [1-p]) and the costs associated with cases A, B and C: CA, CB,CC, CAA and CCC); and the\nLOS costs in each of the scenarios; and of course we have to compute the NPV of all these costs, so\nwe need a discount rate r to bring them all back to 2010.\n\nAnd as if that wasn't enough, for each of A, B, and C we will have two NPVs, one with pr=p (low\ngrowth) and one with pr=[1-p](high growth). So depending on your feelings about risk, you may\nwant to convert these to utilities--but let's assume that away. We have enough here!\n\nSo we could do the numbers and decide whether A, B or C is our best strategy. If p is close to 1 --\nwe are almost sure about low growth--we will likely choose A. On the other hand is p is close to\nzero - we are almost sure about high growth -- then we would prefer C over A, and possibly even B\ncould come into play. So you may want to choose some reasonable numbers and see what happens.\n\nThe difference [CC-CA] is the price of the real option. We are spending money now (in 2010) to\nhave some flexibility in the future, in this case, through lower construction costs [CAA-CCC] in\n2030 if we build a second deck. We are buying an option to be able to have lower construction costs\nin 2030 (CCC, rather than CAA) if we need the second deck.\n\nA Partial Solution\n\nSolving part of this problem may be instructive. Let us compare A with C, ignoring B for the\nmoment (so no two decks in 2010).\n\nFirst, case A:\n\nE(NPV)A = p*[CA+LOS40] + (1-p)*[CA+CAA/(1+r)^20+LOS20]\n\nWhere LOS40 is the PV of the LOS costs over the 40 year span) and LOS20 is the PV of the LOS\ncosts for the first 20 years (since we build the second deck and there are no LOS losses for years 21-\n40.\n\nSpring 2011\n1.011 - Project Evaluation\nProf. Joseph Sussman\n\nNext, case C:\n\nE(NPV)C = p*[CC+LOS40] + (1-p)*[CC+CCC/(1+r)^20+LOS20]\n\nThen calculate the difference in E(NPV)A and E(NPV)C\n\nE(NPV)A- E(NPV)C = p*[CA-CC] + (1-p)*[CA-CC+(CAA-CCC)/(1+r)^20] =\n\n[CA-CC]+ (1-p)*[(CAA-CCC)/(1+r)^20]\n\nNote that all the LOS40 and LOS20 terms fall out when we only compare A and C.\n\nSuppose p=1, which means we are sure of low growth. So if CA= -100 and CC= -105, which means\nit costs us an extra 5 to build in structural strength in case you want to build a second deck. But\nunder low growth, we don't do so, so as we expect, the better case is A. Don't buy the real option.\n\nSuppose p=0, which means we are sure of high growth. Then\n\nE(NPV)A-E(NPV)C= [CA-CC]+ [(CAA-CCC)/(1+r)^20]\n\nSo, plug in some numbers and see what happens. You decide to buy the real option (or not) based on\nthe relative values of CA, CC, CAA, CCC and r.\n\nThe more interesting cases are when p is a value other than 0 or 1.\n\nA Full Solution\n\nNext we consider all three alternatives, A, B and C:\n\nE(NPV)A = p*[CA+LOS40] + (1-p)*[CA+CAA/(1+r)^20+LOS20], as before\n\nE(NPV)B = p*[CB] + (1-p)[CB] which is simply CB. Since two decks is the LOS base case, there\nare no LOS costs.\n\nE(NPV)C = p*[CC+LOS40] + (1-p)*[CC+CCC/(1+r)^20+LOS20], as before\n\nSo again, we can run the numbers for various cases, and can see when the ―real option‖ (CC-CA) is\nworth buying. We leave this as an exercise for the student.\n\nNote that for the full solution, the LOS20 and LOS40 costs do come into play\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n1.011 Project Evaluation\nSpring 2011\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
