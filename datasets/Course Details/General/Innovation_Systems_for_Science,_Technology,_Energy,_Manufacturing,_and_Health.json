It will review the foundations of economic growth theory, innovation systems theory and innovation organization, and the basic approaches to science and technology policy, building toward a sophisticated understanding of these areas. The class will review a theory of direct and indirect economic factors in the innovation system, note the innovation-based competitive and advanced manufacturing challenges now facing the U.S. economy, review comparative efforts in other nations, study the varied models for how federal science and technology mission agencies are organized, and examine the growth of public-private partnership models as a way for science mission agencies to pursue mission agendas.\n\nEmphasis will also be placed on examining the organization and role of medical science and energy innovation agencies and gaps in the health, energy, and advanced production innovation economic models, as well as related innovation systems policy issues. The course will close with an examination of the science and technology talent base as a factor in growth and the education approaches that support it, and a discussion of the future of jobs and employment given increasing automation.\n\nCourse Learning Outcomes\n\nStudents will emerge from the course with a strong grasp of the fundamentals of innovation systems and the economic and technological development factors behind them, and with a clear framework to approach science and technology policymaking. They will understand the basics of innovation-based economic growth theory, and also take an in-depth look at the innovation systems in health and energy.\n\nMore specifically, students will develop an understanding of the following innovation policy areas:\n\nThe drivers behind science and technology support, including economic growth theory, direct and indirect innovation factors, Kondratiev waves, innovation systems theory, the \"valley of death\" between researchh and development, and public-private partnership models.\n\nThe organizing framework behind US science agencies, their missions and research organizational models, and the DARPA model as an alternative.\n\nThe upcoming competitiveness challenge in advanced production technologies, including global innovation models.\n\nThe organization of innovation at both the institutional and personal, face-to-face levels.\n\nChallenges in the energy, computing, and health innovation systems and within legacy economic sectors in general.\n\nKey issues in the science and engineering talent base and education system and pending employment and productivity issues.\n\nGiven the challenges to future federal science support, this course will aim to equip those with interest in, or contemplating careers that could involve, science and technology issues or economic development, including in entrepreneurship, business, academic, non-profit organizations, health, and energy areas, with the basic background for involvement in these policy areas. Students by the end of the course will be able to effectively understand the elements, organize key ideas, and present the foundational framework and policy concepts in these innovation, science, and technology fields.\n\nGrading\n\nAssignment\n\nPercentage\n\nResearch Paper\n\n80%\n\nParticipation\n\n20%\n\nThere will be no exam, but one-page summaries of readings for each class are required to ensure you are keeping up with the course concepts. Aside from the required research project and paper, this course is in significant part a discussion seminar where active, informed, thoughtful, and constructive class participation is a part of the assessment criteria for the course. Students are expected to attend all classes and to be fully prepared to engage in a critical review of the readings in each class; the required short issue summaries for class readings will greatly assist in that class participation preparation.\n\nClass Discussion Time\n\nThe course will be run as a seminar with an emphasis on class discussion.\n\nSignificant time for student participation and discussions will be built into each class. Students will be expected to read the articles or chapters listed for each class. All students for each class will email at least a day in advance to the instructor and student discussion leaders, a one-page summary in \"bullet-point\" outline form of all the readings for that class. This summary should list three or four key points about each reading and below that list two or three key questions about each reading. In addition, particular students, rotating around the class, using the students' one-page summaries, will be asked to lead class Q&A discussion on the readings for each class--so each class will have one or two student discussion leaders.\n\nStarting with the first class, please submit your one-page reading summaries emailed to the instructor in advance of class; the instructor will go over the discussion leader system at the first class and name initial discussion leaders, starting with the second class. So starting with the second class, please email your reading summaries to both the instructor and discussion leaders. The discussion leaders will use your questions in leading the class discussions of the reading.",

Bonvillian\nMIT - STS.081/17.395\nInnovation Systems for Science,\nTechnology, Mfg.,Energy and Health\n\nNorman R. Augustine, Is\nAmerica Falling Off the Flat\nEarth? (NAS 2007)\n- U.S. Children Are Not Prepared for 21st Century\nJobs:\n- According to a recent survey, 86% of US voters\nbelieve that the United States must increase the\nnumber of workers with a background in science and\nmathematics or Americas ability to compete in the\nglobal economy will be diminished.\n- About one-third of the 4th graders and one-fifth of the\n8th graders lacked the competence to perform even\nbasic mathematical computations. Without these\nbasic skills, these students will have trouble\nsucceeding in the future American workforce.\n\nAugustine, Con't\n- US Children Being Taught\nby Teachers Not Trained in\nMath And Science\n- In 1999, 68% of US 8th-grade\nstudents received instruction\nfrom a mathematics teacher\nwho did not hold a degree or\ncertification in mathematics.\n- In 2000, 93% of students in\ngrades 5-9 were taught\nphysical science by a teacher\nlacking a major or certification\nin the physical sciences\n(chemistry, geology, general\nscience, or physics)\n\nAugustine, con't\n- U.S. children Are Falling Behind Their Foreign\nCounterparts\n- We can see the results of our de-emphasis on math and\nscience education in our country and it has long-term,\nglobal implications.\n- In 1995 (the most recent data available), US 12th graders\nperformed below the international average for 21 countries\non a test of general knowledge in mathematics and science.\n- US 15-year-olds ranked 24th out of 40 countries that\nparticipated in a 2003 Program for International Student\nAssessment (PISA) examination, which assessed\nstudents ability to apply mathematical concepts to real-\nworld problems. In 2006, American teenagers ranked 21st\nin science and 25th in math among 30 industrialized nations.\n\nAugustine, con't\n- The US Secondary Educational System is not\nPreparing our Students for Math, Science or\nEngineering Majors and too Few Students end up\nmajoring in disciplines for high-tech careers.\n- Faltering secondary education system: fewer than 15%\nof high school graduates have sufficient mathematics\nand science credentials to even begin pursuing an\nengineering degree, and 40% of four-year college\nstudents end up taking at least one remedial course.\n- To keep up with a more competitive global\nenvironment, need more of our students majoring in\nmath, science and engineering, otherwise Americans\nwill be left behind. Yet, we are seeing the reverse trend.\n\nAugustine, con't\n- Almost twice as many bachelor's degrees were\nawarded in physics the year before Sputnik,\ndeemed a time of dangerous educational neglect,\nas 2007. And, the U.S. share of the global output\nof doctorates in science and engineering declined\nfrom 52% in 1986 to 22% in 2003.\n- The United States ranks 17th among developed\nnations in the proportion of college students\nreceiving degrees in science or engineering, a fall\nfrom third place three decades ago. It ranks 26th\nin the proportion receiving undergraduate degrees\nin mathematics.\n\nAugustine, con't\n- Some 34% of doctoral degrees\nin natural sciences (including\nthe physical, biological, earth,\nocean, and atmospheric\nsciences) and 56% of\nengineering PhDs in the\nUnited States are awarded to\nforeign-born students.\n- Yet, we are moving in the\nwrong direction. About one-\nthird of US students intending\nto major in engineering switch\nmajors before graduating. As\na result, 38% of PhDs in the\nUS science and technology\nworkforce were foreign-born,\nas of 2000.\n\nProf. Paul M. Romer (Stanford, NYU),\nShould the Government Subsidize Supply\nor Demand in the Market for Scientists and\nEngineers? Nat'l Bur. Of Eco. Res.,\nWorking Paper 7723 (6/2000)\n- The Issue: Federal Gov't subsidizes private sector\ndemand (esp. tax incentives, R&D tax credit) for\nscientist/engineer talent\n- Doesn't ask whether the supply response allows\nthese subsidies to work\n- Reality: Institutional arrangements in Univ's limit\nthis supply response\n- So we need: new incentive system\n\nRomer, Con't-Underlying Thesis:\n- 1) In the 20th Century, rapid technological\nprogress in the US drove the unprecedented\ngrowth in output and standards of living\n- 2) fostered by publicly supported system of\neducation that provided the essential input into the\nprocess of discovery and innovation - a steady\nflow of people trained in scientific method and in\nthe state of the art in their area of specialization\n- YET: Public Policy has ignored the structure of\nour institutions of higher ed\n- SO: gov't programs to speed up innovation rate is\nthwarted by that structure\n- Gov't programs focused on the DEMAND (R&D\ntax credit) side not the SUPPLY side for this\ntalent- wrong direction - inefficient\n\nRomer - Thesis, Con't:\n- Speeding up growth is the only way we'll be able\nto cope with the demographics revolution that is\nupon us - need at least .5% higher growth rate\n- Conservative estimate of of the add'l return on\nR&D spending: 25% [this is low - over 50%]\n- So increase R&D spending by 2% of GDP and,\nvoila! Were at +.5% GDP growth!\n- BUT: to speed up growth it is not enough to\nincrease spending on on R&D\n- Instead - have to increase the total quantity of\ninputs that go into the process of R&D\n- That Means: TALENT, the big input\n\nRomer - Thesis, Con't:\n- A \"basic insight of economics is that for the\neconomy as a whole, things have to add up\n- If the total number of scientists and engineers is\nfixed then you limit your biggest input into\ninnovation and thus growth - (basic idea behind\nRomers Prospector Theory)\n- And: US is not expanding its supply of science\nand engineering talent -went way up from .3% to\n.8% of labor force (GI bill, Sputnik) but frozen\nsince 60's - growth drag (and wait until baby\nboom retires, when it will get worse)\n- SO: despite increase of gov't incentives on tax\nside to corps. (ie, demand subsidy) , this is not\nresulting in growth of key input to innovation -\ntalent\n\nRomer, Con't - The Undergrad Supply\nProblem in Univ's:\n- If demand side incentives aren't working, what\nhas broken down on the talent supply side?\n- Univ. measures itself by ability to select top-SAT\nscoring students - not pressured to indicate what\nhappens to them (ie, no salary info)\n- Traditional liberal arts univ. faces little pressure to\nrespond to shift in skills needs\n- Univ. has fixed investment in faculty teaching\noutside sciences\n- So: Internal pressure to maintain the relative size\nof dept's\n- Univ Solution - Make it more difficult for students\nto get science degrees\n\nRomer - Undergrad Problem, Con't :\n- Science faculty is happy to keep teaching loads down by\nkeeping professional standards\" high- ie, lower grades\n- Other non-science dept's increase their attractiveness by\ngrade inflation\n- This is what is happening: 40-50% of students entering\nundergrad science/engineering programs shift to other\nareas\n- Grade inflation is real in non-science, has not happened\nin sciences/engineering\n- 1998 study: 80%+ A's or B's for History/English vs. 54%\nMath -\n- Supply problem for undergrads affects grad student\nlevels\n- US industry tries to make shortfall up with foreign born\nscience talent - starting to dominate US science and\nengineering PhD programs\n\nRomer - The Univ PhD Problem:\n- In science PhD programs: supply growth, but trained for\nacademia (in basic not applied research), yet there the\nnumber of faculty positions is frozen\n- Result of zero academic demand: PhD training now 8 years,\nand post doc invented to allow huge surplus to hang\naround univ's (medieval: apprentices for masters)\n- Result: science PhD frustration\n- Romer's picture: \"undergrad institutions that are a critical\nbottleneck in the training for scientists and engineers\n- AND graduate schools that produce people trained only\nfor employment in academic institutions as a side product of\nproducing basic research results\n- The challenge in this area is not to increase the total\nnumbers of PhD recipients but to increase the fraction of\nthem that can put their skills to work in private sector\nR&D\n\nRomer, Con't - Supply Goals:\n- Romer doesn't wring his hands like a typical\neconomist dark science type, he actually\nproposes interesting fixes!\n- Goal: Increase the fraction of 24 year old citizens\nwith degrees in sci/engineering from 5.4% of 24\nyear olds to 10% by 2020\n- Goal: Innovation in grad training programs in\nsci/engineering - training for private sector R&D\n- Goal: redress the imbalance in federal incentives\nfor demand AND supply and get the supply\nincentives right this time - $1b\n\nRomer, Con't -\nSupply Fixes:\n- Fix #1: training grants to under\ngrad univ's that increase the\nnumbers of students receiving\nsci/engineering degrees\n- Fix #2: objective achievement-\nbased tests that show undergrad\nmastery of sci/engineering areas\n(break grading system)\n- Fix #3: new class of portable\nfellowships that pay $20,000 for 3\nyears of grad training in\nsci/engineering - and fund a new\ntype of degree that reflects this\nprogram\n\nRichard B. Freeman, Does Globalization\nof the Sci/Eng. Workforce Threaten U.S.\nEconomic Leadership? (6/05)\n- US - 5% of world pop., but 1/3 of world\nsci/engineering researchers\n- US comparative advantage - leadership in sci/tech\n- US share of world S&E workforce declining\n- China: no PhDs in 1975; in 03, 13,000\n- China will produce more PhDs than US by 2010\n- Foreign born share of US Sci/Eng PhDs: 42%\n- US has adequate supply of Sci/Eng talent only\nbecause of sci/eng immigrants from abroad\n\nFreeman, Con't\n- Offshoring R&D - Major high\ntech firms are locating new R&D\nfacilities in China and India\n- As nos. of sci/eng's working in\nforeign countries increases, US\ncomparative advantage in high\ntech sectors will decline\n- What is good for other parts of the\nworld is not inevitably good for\nthe US\n\nFreeman,\nsummary\n- This paper develops four propositions\nthat show that changes in the global job\nmarket for science and engineering\n(S&E) workers are eroding US\ndominance in S&E, which diminishes\ncomparative advantage in high tech\nproduction and creates problems for\nAmerican industry and workers:\n- (1) The U.S. share of the world's science\nand engineering graduates is declining\nrapidly as European and Asian\nuniversities, particularly from China,\nhave increased S&E degrees while US\ndegree production has stagnated.\n- 2) The job market has worsened for\nyoung workers in S&E fields relative to\nmany other high-level occupations,\nwhich discourages US students from\ngoing on in S&E, but which still has\nsufficient rewards to attract large\nimmigrant flows, particularly from\ndeveloping countries.\n\nFreeman\nSummary, con't\n-\n3) Populous low income countries such as\nChina and India can compete with the US in\nhigh tech by having many S&E specialists\nalthough those workers are a small proportion\nof their work forces. This threatens to undo the\n\"North-South\" pattern of trade in which\nadvanced countries dominate high tech while\ndeveloping countries specialize in less skilled\nmanufacturing.\n-\n4) Diminished comparative advantage in high-\ntech will create a long period of adjustment for\nUS workers, of which the off-shoring of IT jobs\nto India, growth of high-tech production in\nChina, and multinational R&D facilities in\ndeveloping countries, are harbingers.\n-\nTo ease the adjustment to a less dominant\nposition in science and engineering, the US\nwill have to develop new labor market and\nR&D policies that build on existing strengths\nand develop new ways of benefitting from\nscientific and technological advances in other\ncountries.\n\nClaudia Goldin & Lawrence\nKatz (Harvard economists),\nThe Future of Inequality:\n(Milken Inst. Review July 2009)\n- Gap between wages of educated and less well\neducated workers growing since 1980\n- This expanding wage inequality has characterized\nUS since that time\n- But: wage inequality narrowed from 1910 into the\n1950's - then was stable until the 1980's\n- Why? Race between technological change and\neducated workforce\n\nGoldin and Katz, con't\n- Technology advance - key to growth\n- Requires ever-higher educational attainment\n- Have to be well- educated to realize the gains of\ntechnology advance\n- Ebb and flow of wage inequality is all about education\nand technology\n- US economy grew rapidly in post-WW2-1973\nperiod\n- 1947-1973: real income grew 2.6% - all quintiles\n- 1973-2005: bottom fifth of real income: no growth;\n- Top fifth 1.6% annual growth; top 5% 2% annual growth\n- In that 1973-2005 period: wage inequality tied to rising\ndifferences between wages of highly educated and less\neducated\n\nGoldin & Katz, con't\n- Average years of schooling increased rapidly and\ncontinuously for Americans born from 1875 to 1950\n- US led the world in universal education in the first half of the 20th\ncentury\n- Free compulsory education increased from grade school to high school;\ncontinued with mass higher education - a US first\n- Efforts to reduce wage inequality depend on increasing\nthe supply of educated workers\n- US economy grew rapidly through technology advance,\nwith wages growing in tandem to growing education\nattainment 1910 through 1973\n- US led way in mass secondary then mass higher ed\n- Educational attainment increased almost 1 year per decade from 1875\nto 1950\n- But then attainment stagnated in 1970s - plateau-ed\n- Sharp slowdown in rise in high school and college grad\n\nGoldin & Katz, con't\n- College grads continue to command a wage premium -\nstrong growth since 1950\n- Relative supply of college-educated workers increased at annual\nrate of 3.8% from 1960-80, but at just 2% from 1980-2005\n- The soaring wage premium for college-educated workers is driven\nby the supply shift\n- Starting 1973 (and esp. 1980s) growing wage inequality\n- parallels two factors: rising technology advance and\nstagnating ed attainment for bottom 3/5s of wage\nearners\n- Want to restore widespread wage mobility? Revitalize\neducation attainment - and spread gains of tech\nadvance through society again, not just top tier\n\nProf. William J. Baumol, NYU,\nEducation for Innovation:\nEntrepreneurial Breakthroughs\nvs. Corporate Incremental\nImprovements,\" Nat'l Bur. Eco.\nResearch, Working Paper (April\n30 2004)\n- Thesis:\n- Breakthrough innovation comes from independent\ninventors and entrepreneurs\n- Large firms concentrate on incremental innovation\n- Education for mastery of of science knowledge\naids incremental advance not breakthroughs\n\nBaumol - Thesis, Con't:\n- Standard science education may impede\nbreakthrough thinking and imagination\n- Large firm R&D requires scientists & engineers\neducated in extant info and analytic methods\n- Successful inventors and entrepreneurs often lack\nsuch standard preparation\n- Procedures for incremental learning seem to work\n- but we don't know how to educate for\ninnovation\n\nBaumol, Cont-\nTalent Examples:\n- Proctor & Gamble - 7500\nscientists, 1250 PhDs, more\nthan the Harvard, Stanford, MIT\nfaculties, 22 research centers, 12\ncountries --- VERSES:\n- Watt, Eli Whitney, Fulton,\nMorse, Edison, the Wright Bros.,\nWozniak, Jobs, Gates & Dell -\nno college degrees, little sci.\ntraining\n- Education where you master the\nreceived body of knowledge may\nbe a hindrance to invention,\ninnovation\n\nBaumol, Con't - Contrast\nin Small/Large Company\nRoles\n- Progress requires both breakthrough\nideas and protracted follow-up process\nof cumulative incremental improvement\nof breakthroughs\n- Industrial labs ill-suited to\nbreakthroughs but well-designed for the\nincremental tasks\n- Sharp differentiation between economic\ncontributions of entrepreneurs/inventors\ncontributing novel technologies and\nlarge firms providing improvements\n- 70% of US R&D (ie, D) is private\nsector, and that means large firms and\nthus incremental\n- Most revolutionary new ideas of last\n200 years provided by independent\nentrepreneurs - see SBA surveys\n\nBaumol, Con't - 7 Hypotheses:\n- 1) Disproportinate share of breakthroughs from\nindependent inventors/entrepreneurs, large firms do\nincremental\n- 2) Large proportion of startups involve former ee's of\nlarge firms - leave because large firm unreceptive to\nnovel ideas, or little reward for novel ideas\n- 3) Training for mastery of available sci/tech data is of\ngreat value for innovation and growth; but education\nfor original thinking and imagination also crucial to\ngrowth\n\nBaumol - 7 Hypotheses, Con't:\n- 4) Education for incremental advance different\nfrom education for novel advance\n- 5) R&D divisions of large firms require personnel\nwith training in extant sci/tech info and extant\nanalytical methods; this kind of education may\nhinder the independent entrepreneur/ inventor\n- 6) Incremental improvement may require far more\nmastery of demanding sci/tech info than original\nnovel idea\n- Example - think of the airplane the Wright Bros. built\nvs. what a Boeing 787 is like\n\nBaumol - 7 Hypotheses, Con't:\n- While both educational approaches may be very\ndifferent, neither is inferior to the other - need\nboth - both essential for innovation and growth\n- Problem:\n- We seem to have down education for acquiring\nextant sci/tech info - BUT:\n- How do you educate for original and novel idea\ngeneration?\n- American Education seems to be less demanding and\nrigid than other industrialized countries, hence some\ninnovation success? - but what are the key features?\n\nBonvillian & Weiss,\nLegacy Sectors book - The\nOnline Challenge to\nHigher Education - 2015\n- Opening Q's:\n- Will MOOCs be a\ndisruptive innovation\nand disrupt higher ed\nsubstituting a new\nmodel?\n- Will higher ed respond\nwith a 'Blended Model'\nor just ignore this?\n\nBonvillian and\nWeiss, con't\n- Univ.'s are deep problem\nfor this disruptive\ninnovation: Universities\nare Legacy Sectors\n- Resist disruptive change\n- Conduct almost no R&D on\neducation -

think this is IT \"new\nmagic\"\n- Free, online higher education!\n- Right:We can get rid of pesky left-\nwing universities with a low cost\nfor-profit model!\n- Left:We can get rid of outrageous\ntuition - drive tuition through the\nfloor - make higher education low\ncost, and more accessible than ever\nbefore!\n- States passing laws requiring\n$10,000 BAs\n- California - requiring state univ's to\ngive credit where not enough\nstudent seats\n\nBut...\n-What will\nhappen to --\nResidential\nCampus\nEducation?\n\nWhat Online Ed\nCan Do\n- Online learning can support\nan education shift - new tool:\n- Tool for visualization,\nrepresentation, reinforcement\nand assessment.\n- Using feedback loops and\nrepetition tied to continuous\nassessment, online can convey\ninformation and content,\nreinforcing both.\n- Online will have features better\nthan lectures and could force\ninteractive classrooms and\nrestructuring of face-to-face\nlearning.\n\nWhat Online Ed\nCan't Do\n- Vital education components\nremain face-to-face:\n- development of oral\nexpression, presentation and\nadvocacy skills and\norganizing expertise.\n- Written analysis currently\nrequires human assessment\nexcept for straightforward\nassignments.\n- Research, central to learning-\nby-doing in science, remains\nface-to-face, although online\nfeatures can enhance it.\n\nWhat Remains Face-to-Face:\n- The social features of exchanges in classroom and seminar\nbuild student involvement in learning\n- interactive online features still can't fully substitute for\nface-to-face intensity.\n- Learning requires human scaffolding -\n- for discourse,\n- for argumentation,\n- for mentoring,\n- for making the case,\n- for research,\n- for making the conceptual leap.\n\nBlended Learning\n- It will be the \"human-machine\nsymbiosis\"\n- Machines will do what they\nare good at - content,\ninformation\n- Teachers will do what only\nthey can do - mentoring,\ndirecting discussion, pushing\nexpression of expertise\n- Blended learning needs to\nprevail\n- Will it?\n\nBUT: The Technology will Change\n- Online technology's interactive social and evaluation\nfeatures will evolve\n- Can build online discussion groups\n- Still: not personal competition, intensity\n- Machine writing evaluation - getting better at edX-\nbest: word use, rubrics, core concepts - same grade\na teacher grader 85% of the time\n- Research can be complemented by online\nsimulation and modeling = HANDS ON LEARNING\nTECHNOLOGY\n- i-Lab - access to actual adv'd lab\n- DOD: join personal tutors and MOOCs\n- Boundaries between online and face-to-face will\nshift if we join it with the learning science.\n\nWill Online Ed Disrupt\nUniversities?\n- Will universities go the way of publishers,\nnewpapers, broadcast journalism?\n- If universities disappear: no course content\n- Universities are research engines as well as\nteaching and learning centers\n- In a knowledge economy, no substitute for\nuniversities -they are the knowledge economy\n- The university has become central to the way we\norganize an innovative society\n- No real replacement -\n- Students need learning mentors -

BONVILLIAN, LECTURER\nMIT - STS.081/17.395\nINNOVATION SYSTEMS FOR SCIENCE,\nTECHNOLOGY, MFG., ENERGY & HEALTH\n\nERIC BRYNJOLFFSON (PROF. MIT SLOAN SCH.) AND\nANDREW MCAFEE (PRIN. RESEARCH SCIENTIST, MIT) THE\nRACE AGAINST THE MACHINE (RESEARCH BRIEF,\nMIT CENTER FOR DIGITAL BUSINESS JAN. 2012)\n! After the Great Recession, economy was \"not putting people back to work\"\n! Recession wasn't a standard business cycle, where employees were rehired\nImage courtesy of New America on Flickr.\n! Not cyclical, was it \"STAGNATION\" - long term decline in US ability to innovate and increase\nproductivity?\n! Third explanation: not stagnation - NOT TOO LITTLE INNOVATION, TOO MUCH - Jeremy Rifkin\n1995: \"end of work\" was the cause - technological job displacement\n! Computers displacing people: even making inroads in \"urbanized driving,\" \"complex\ncommunication\" - ex.: Google's driverless car, Watson's Jeopardy\n! Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence\" (2000)\n! EXPONENTIAL GROWTH IN COMPUTING IS ON US - Computers are thousands of times better than 30 years ago\n! But: computers not good at combined physical and knowledge yet, not general problem solving,\nnot at creative abilities - but exponential progress\n\nBRYNJOLFSSON AND MCAFEE, CON'T\n! Given exponential computing improvement causing technological displacement:\ntwo strategies:\n! 1) ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION\n! \"inventing new organizational structures, processes, and business models that leverage ever-advancing\ntechnology and human skills\"\n! The stagnation of median wages and polarization of job growth is an opportunity for creative\nentrepreneurs.\n! They can develop new business models that combine the swelling numbers of mid-skilled workers with\never- cheaper technology to create value.\n! There has never been a worse time to be competing with machines, but there has never been a\nbetter time to be a talented entrepreneur .\n! Digital technologies create enormous opportunities for individuals to use their unique and dispersed\nknowledge for the benefit of the whole economy. But are there enough opportunities for all these\nentrepreneurs?\n! Are we running out of innovations? When businesses are based on bits instead of atoms, then each new\nproduct adds to the set of building blocks available to the next entrepreneur instead of depleting the\nstock of ideas...'\n\nBRYNJOLFSSON AND MCAFEE, CON'T\n! we need not only organizational innovation, orchestrated by entrepreneurs, but also a\nsecond broad strategy: investments in the complementary human capital:\n! 2) INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL:\n! Improve \"the education and skills required to get the most out of our racing technology.\"\n! Unfortunately , our educational progress has stalled and this is reflected in stagnating\nwages and fewer jobs. Although the United States once led the world in the education of\nits citizens, it has fallen from first to tenth in the share of citizens who are college\ngraduates.\n! It's not a coincidence that the educational sector also lags as an adopter of information\ntechnologies. The optimistic interpretation is that we have tremendous upside potential for\nimprovements in education.\"\n! THERE IS A - THIRD INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION: COMPUTING AND INFORMATION, AND\nINFORMATION DOESN'T GET USED UP\n\nDAVID AUTOR (PROF. OF ECONOMICS, MIT), WHY\nARE THERE STILL SO MANY JOBS? THE HISTORY\nAND FUTURE OF WORKPLACE AUTOMATION,\nJOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES V. 29,\nN. 3 SUMMER 2015, 3-30.\n! Traditional Economics: technological advance, since the industrial\n! revolution, including automation, always creates net new jobs - has\nthat now changed?\n! COMPLEMENTARITY: \"automation has not wiped out a majority of\njobs over the decades and centuries. Automation does indeed substitute for labor--\nas it is typically intended to do. However, automation also complements labor, raises\noutput in ways that lead to higher demand for labor, and interacts with adjustments\nin labor supply. Indeed, a key observation of the paper is that journalists and even\nexpert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human\nlabor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that\nincrease productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor.\"\n\nAUTOR, WHY ARE THERE STILL SO MANY JOBS?\n! \"Complementarity\" - automation and people: EXAMPLE:\n! ATMs were introduced in the 1970s; their numbers in the US economy quadrupled from\n100,000 to 400,000 between 1995 and 2010.\n! Did these machines eliminated bank tellers?\n! US bank teller employment rose modestly from 500,000 to approximately 550,000 over\nthe 30-year period from 1980 to 2010\n! Routine cash-handling tasks of bank tellers receded\n! But: information technology also enabled a broader range of bank personnel to become\ninvolved in \"relationship banking.\"\n! Banks recognized the value of tellers enabled by information technology, not primarily as\ncheckout clerks, but as salespersons, forging relationships with customers and introducing\nthem to additional bank services like credit cards, loans, and investment products.\n! NOTE: Over the very long run, gains in productivity have NOTled to a shortfall of\ndemand for goods and services - THESE KEEP GROWING - this is an offsetting factor\n\nAUTOR, WHY ARE THERE STILL SO MANY JOBS?\n! Last three decades: \"polarization\" of the labor market\n! Wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top\n! Employment growth was at the bottom of the income and skill distribution,\n! Not for those in the middle.\n! 1940-1970:\n!\nphysically demanding, repetitive, dangerous, and cognitively monotonous work receded, because of\nextraordinary productivity gains in agriculture.\n! Rising consumer affluence spurred demand for manufactured goods and leisure complements.\n! Growth of technologically intensive corporations, health care services, and higher education created\nemployment for credentialed professionals\n! and a cadre of supporting clerical, administrative, and sales workers.\n! automation was reducing labor demand across large number of occupations, but overall job prospects\nappeared broadly favorable during period.\n! 1980-2010\n!\nprofessional, technical, and managerial occupations--grew even more rapidly\n!\nSkilled blue-collar occupations shrank rapidly\n! clerical and sales occupations--the vulnerable \"production jobs\" of the information age--declined\n! low-paid personal services absorbed increasing share of non-college labor.\n\nAUTOR, WHY ARE THERE STILL SO MANY JOBS?\n! In the Interplay between machine and human:\n! comparative advantage allows computers to substitute for workers in performing\nroutine, codifiable tasks\n! But it also amplifies the comparative advantage of workers in supplying\nproblem-solving skills, adaptability, and creativity.\n! Frontier of automation is rapidly advancing -\n! challenge to substituting machines for workers in tasks requiring flexibility,\njudgment, and common sense remains immense.\n! In many cases, machines both substitute for and complement human labor.\n! Focus only on what is lost misses a central economic mechanism -\n! automation affects the demand for labor by raising the value of the tasks that\nworkers uniquely supply.\n\nDAVID AUTOR (PROF. OF ECONOMICS, MIT), SKILLS,\nEDUCATION AND THE RISE OF EARNINGS INEQUALITY\nSCIENCE, V. 344, N. 6186, MAY 23, 2014, 843-851\n! Issue: steep, persistent rise of earnings inequality\n! in the U.S. labor market\n! and in developed countries generally\n! Why Look at Inequality?\n! First, earnings premium for education has risen across a large number of advanced nations\n! this rise contributes substantially to the net growth of earnings inequality\n! In the US, 2/3s of the overall rise of earnings dispersion between 1980 and 2005 is accounted for by the increased premium\nassociated with schooling in general and postsecondary education in particular\n! Second, literature finds that interplay between the supply and demand for skills provides insight into why the\nskill premium has risen,\n! specifically, the earnings gap between college and high school graduates has more than doubled in the United States over the\npast three decades.\n! Third - skill premium offers insight into the evolution of inequality within a market economy,\n! Highlights the social costs - and gains of upper middle class\n! Clear role for public policy\n\nGEORGETOWN UNIV. CENTER ON ED AND THE WORKFORCE -\nUPCOMING JOB OPENINGS:\nDemand -\n- High. Sch. Diploma & Less than High Sch. Diploma - 19.7m\n- Some College, Assoc.

Rising demand for educated labor in advanced economies, including US\n! If the supply of educated labor does not keep pace with persistent outward shifts\nin demand for skills, the skill premium will rise.\n! In the words of the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, \"...it\ntakes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\"\n! When the rising supply of educated labor began to slacken in the early 1980s\n(college graduation rate stabilizes between 1975-1982, only starts rising again\nin 2004), a logical economic consequence was an increase in the college skill\npremium.\n! That factor is a significant one in accounting for income inequality in the US\n! Public policy response: Up-skilling\n\nDAVID MINDELL (PROF., MIT STS), OUR ROBOTS\nOURSELVES - ROBOTICS AND THE MYTH OF AUTONOMY\n(2015) 1-11, 191-218 (CHAPTS. 1 AND 6)\n! Mindell takes an in-depth look at human-robot interaction in four major areas of\nrobotics advances:\n! undersea operations,\n! space exploration,\n! drones, and\n! driverless cars.\n! In each, he finds deep complementarity between robots and people--each has skill\nsets that enhance the other's.\n! Fits the famous 1960 work on computing by J. C. R. Licklider (the theorist behind the\nInternet and personal computing).\n! Licklider saw computing on a human-computer continuum, a \"man-machine symbiosis\"\nwhere both sides together optimize a greatly improved combined performance,\nwhich indeed has been the overall history in this sector to date..\n\nMINDELL, OUR ROBOTS, OURSELVES\n! Mindell's vision is that there can be a much richer space when people and robotics are\njoined -\n! A much richer understanding and ability to make perceptions and judgements\n! That is what has been worked out as optimal in undersea, space, UAVs - that is 40\nyears of learning\n! This new environment is what the future will be about between people and machines,\nnot machines displacing people\n! It will be better than just a machine world or people world - it will be integrated\n! People get inside the robots and the robots are extensions of themselves, they are on\nsite with the robots, as though they were the robots and the robots extensions of\nthemselves -\n! that is the UAV/drone story, the undersea exploration story, the space story - it will\nbe the driverless car story\n\nMINDELL, OUR ROBOTS OURSELVES\n! For driverless cars, he envisions\n! a much richer driver experience, much more engagement\nwith the surroundings, much greater information and\nknowledge access, much better safety and comfort,\nreduced driver tension, a learning experience,\n! but because of the demands of people in the constant\ndecision process, the driver cannot sleep in the trunk\n! Note: A chessmaster and a computer always beat either a\nperson or a computer in chess - it will be a symbiosis\n\nWILLIAM B. BONVILLIAN AND PETER SINGER, ADVANCED\nMANUFACTURING - THE NEW INNOVATION POLICIES (MIT\nPRESS - PUBLICATION PENDING DEC. 2017), CHAPTER 9\n! Starting with the Luddites in 1815, long been workforce concern about automation\n! The largest workforce disruption in US history was in agriculture occurred between 1810\nand 1960, where ag workforce dropped from 80% to below 10%\n! 1950 - MIT's Norbert Weiner introduced term \"cybernetics\", concern about computer\ndisplacement of people\n! 1960s - major anxiety about workforce automation\n! 2015 - concern is back - AI, machine learning, robotics mix - threatening\n! Economist John Maynard Keynes - \"Thus we have been expressly evolved by nature--\nwith all our impulses and deepest instincts--for the purpose of solving the economic\nproblem. If the economic problem is solved, making will be deprived of its traditional\npurpose.\" Will the economy ever achieve high enough productivity level to cut work\nhours? No sign of this yet - US average workweek is 47 hours.\n\nBONVILLIAN AND SINGER - FUTURE OF WORK\nCHAPTER 9, CON'T\n- Backdrop: significant work disruption - 1/3 of manufacturing jobs lost, 2000-10\n- Median income of those without high school diploma down 20% between 1990-2013;\nmedian income of those with high school diploma or some college down 13%\n- Bar bell problem: thriving upper middle class with significantly growing incomes, thinning\nmiddle being shunted to lower paid lower end services sector\n- Great majority of jobs created since end of the 2007-08 recession went to college\ngrads\n- Brynjolfsson and McAfee led the tech displacement concern: growth of IT advances\nunparalleled and unprecedented; software has near zero marginal cost for expansion; mix\nof AI, machine learning, robotics will disrupt work\n- Martin Ford: \"winner take all distribution\" - tendency of software toward monopoly, and\n- \"computers do more than they are programmed for\" - deep learning\n- lower end pushed out\n\nBONVILLIAN AND SINGER- FUTURE OF WORK\nCHAPTER 9, CONT'\n! David Cowen\n! technological displacement means country likely to be divided into two distinct classes,\n! Property values in most cities too expensive, separate low income communities\n! \"In essence, we would be recreating a Mexico-like or Brazil-like environment in part of the US\"\n! Brynjorfsson and McAfee (in Second Machine Age):\n! new jobs, mostly low skilled, replace the middle skill jobs that are displaced by technology\n! But view rising inequality as more manageable - tax policy can help:\n! Pigouvian taxes (tax on business for engaging in specific negative activity), carbon tax, and\ntaxes on economic rents, on land or superstars, ameliorate the problem.\n! Over the long run, they advocate for a negative income tax, as the best way to guarantee a\nbasic income while maintaining an incentive for work.\n! [Note: these taxes: politically unlikely]\n\nBONVILLIAN AND SINGER, FUTURE OF WORK\nCHAPTER 9, CON'T\n! Frey and Osborne (Oxford): look at occupational definitions -\n! based on this find 47% of US jobs have high likelihood of being replaced by automation\n! Rob Atkinson, ITIF:\n! Attacks Frey and Osborne: their list of occupations to be replaced are experiencing low productivity gains\n! they assume a highly unlikely 3% labor productivity rate - haven't seen since 19th century\n! They also assume there is a fixed amount of work (\"lump of labor\" fallacy)\n! but work is more dynamic, unemployment can be offset by the introduction of new goods or more goods into\nthe market, by shorter working days, or by a combination of the two that is decided by society.\n! OECD Study - 2016\n! Looked not at occupational definitions, but at what workers in categories were actually doing - much richer story,\nwere doing much more than occupational definition\n! Found in 22 OECD nations, 6 to 12% of jobs lost IT - US was 10% over expended period - manageable\n! Note: we're in a period of low productivity and low capital investment -\n! no sign of a ramp-up to widespread automation - yet [note: Pratt/Leonard driverless car ex.]\n! Nauna Hejlund, VP Danish Conf. of Trade Unions:\n! \" New technology is not the enemy of workers, old technology is.\" (2016)\n\nSPEED AT WHICH ROBOTS ARE BEING INSTALLED IN\nPRODUCTION HAS SLOWED SIGNIFICANTLY:\nNumber of Manufacturing Employees for Each Industrial Robot\nWorkers per Robot\nYear\nU.S.\nGermany\nJapan\nKorea\n\nBONVILLIAN AND SINGER, FUTURE OF WORK\nCHAPTER 9, CON'T\n! The problem now is not automation it's \"Secular Stagnation\" -\n! Term developed in the 1930s by Alvin Hansen - economy ends up stuck with low growth and high\nunemployment because of a shortfall of investment\n! Larry Summers returns in 2013 to this theory - with interest rates around zero, U.S. output is insufficient to\nsupport full employment.\n! factors hampering investment demand: decreasing population growth, a relative decrease in the cost of\ncapital goods, and excess money being retained not used by large corporations.\n! on savings side, excessive reserve holdings among developing countries, post crisis financial regulations,\ninequality and increasing intermediation costs.\n! excess of savings over investment slows growth and increases unemployment.\n! instead of supply creating its own demand, demand is unable to create sufficient supply\n! Calls for fiscal stimulus\n! Overall - US has: low productivity, low capital investment, low growth rate, growing inequality, declining middle\nclass -\n! unemployment is below 5%, but structural unemployment, sizable part of workforce not in the\neconomy\n\nEXCESS OF U.S. SAVINGS OVER INVESTMENT -\nLIMITED INVESTMENT SLOWS GROWTH\nSAVINGS AND INVESTMENT\n$0.00\n$500.00\n$1,000.00\n$1,500.00\n$2,000.00\n$2,500.00\n$3,000.00\n$3,500.00\n$4,000.00\nDOLLARS (BILLIONS)\nYEAR\nGross Private Savings\nGross Private Domestic Investment\n\nBONVILLIAN AND SINGER, FUTURE OF WORK\nCHAPTER 9, CON'T\n! Robert Gordon (Rise and Fall of American Growth) - Contrary View on Secular\nStagnation\n! current low growth and secular stagnation result not of insufficient demand but insufficient\nsupply - ie, insufficient technological supply - the real drag on the economy.\n! declining overall total factor productivity growth in the U.S. (with 1990s exception) since 70s\n! Is it that the IT revolution just fading and we can temporarily expect to see low or no gains,\nor, Gordon suggests, is there a permanent decline in technological advancement?\n! Gordon's view that we have already picked the low hanging fruit of technological\ndevelopment and there are only limited advances ahead - controversial\n! How to fix this: Gordon says fixing societal \"headwinds\" is best option for improving growth:\neducational attainment, income inequality, changing demographics, government debt, and\nsocial breakdown.\n\nBONVILLIAN AND SINGER, FUTURE OF WORK\nCHAPTER 9, CON'T\n! Summers - Solution is Fiscal Stimulus - Infrastructure Bill\n! Fixing the growth rate is tied to growing productivity, which is tied to technological innovation\n! Problem: traditional infrastructure (repairing roads, sewers) isn't technological innovation - it is\nnot productivity enhancing\n! Yet we have have a big productivity growth problem a traditional infrastructure bill won't fix\n! We already rode those surface transportation innovation waves, they largely played out\n! And how much can we do? Obama Stimulus was only able to spend $25 billion on\ntransportation - not that many \"shovel ready projects\n! It's not bad - could help in unemployment in lower skilled working class, but a high growth rate\nfixes a lot of problems, and this won't do that\n! ALTERNATIVE - Invest in \"Innovation Infrastructure\"\n! Advanced manufacturing is a good example - helps in employment\n!

Press 1993)\n- Technological capabilities of a\nnations firms are a key source\nof their competitive prowess\n-Nelson develops the term:\nnational innovation systems\nDoes the term make sense despite transnational\nbusinesses? - yes\ninnovation - Nelson uses broad def., process by\nwhich firms master and get into practice product\ndesigns and new manufacturing processes\n\n2) Schumpeterian Innovator\n- Destructive Capitalism occurs via innovation - its not\nnecessarily the first innovator that captures most of the\neconomic rents associated with the innovation\n- Therefore: a nations concern is in broader innovative\ncapability\n- Not limited only to firms or only to science research but\nto a SYSTEM - a set of institutional actors that\ninfluence innovative performance\n- Q: Whats the way technical advance proceeds - what\nare the key processes?-A: science and trial and error\nlearning\n- Q: Institutional actors? A: univ.s, firms, government\nagencies and policies\n- Q: is there a common analytical framework across\nnations?\n\n3) Science as Both Leader and Follower:\n- New science gives rise to new technology (and vice\nversa)\n- Electricity - Science as Leader:\n- Faraday 1831 - electromagnetic induction\n- Incandescent light, gramaphone-Edison, telephone-Bell\n- Hertz 1887 - radio waves - radio, TV\n- Radio/TV, electricity - NOT because scientists seeking\napplications\n- Chemistry- Science as Follower:\n- First-alchemy, tanning, dyeing, brewing - practical applications\n- 1860s - Kekule - molecular structure of benzene - leads to\norganic chemistry\n- Polymer chemistry - grew from industry needs\n- Chemical Engineering - merger of chemistry and mechanical\nengineering - interdisciplinary advance\n\n4) More Science as Follower:\n- Steam engine workings- J. Willard Gibbs creates science of\nthermodynamics\n- Edison - develops electricity-based lighting (flow of electricity\nacross gap)- has to develop electron theory - yields much of\n20th century physics, electronics\n- Aircraft technology (starts with Wright Bros - bike mechanics)\n- yields aerospace engineering\n- Transistor (Bardeen, Shockley, Brittain - Bell Labs) in 1940\nleads to growth of solid-state physics\n- Computing - yields computer science\n- Lasers and optical fiber yield science of optics\n- SO: science yields technology but technology yields science -\nrich and complex interaction\n- Need both science and technology leadership for both\nscience and technology leadership - interact\n\n5) Limits of Science:\n- Innovation in high tech - is not only invention\nbut:\n- - Design - choosing the right mix of\nperformance characteristics - ex.-modern\naircraft wing\n- Most R&D spending is incremental\nimprovements - ex., jet engines added to\naircraft replacing propellers\n- process of incremental advance is not classic\nscience breakthrough\n\n6) Who are the Innovation \"Institutional\nActors\"?\n- 1. Industry Lab- by WWI industrial research lab\nstaffed by Univ.-trained scientists and engineers\n- dedicated to invention and incremental\nenhancements\n- More impt. than univ. or govt lab -\n- because: after initial tech. in place users have\nknowledge of strength and weaknesses that transcends\ngeneral public scientific knowledge\n- Reverse engineering is R&D in many countries\n- Note: R&D only part of larger innovation\npicture - management style, man. org.,\nincluding for R&D, also impt.\n\n7) Innovation Institutional\nActors, Con't.\n- 2. University Labs -\n- Univ.-Firm Connection - modern industrial research\nlab and modern research univ. grew up as\ncompanions/partners\n- Many academic science fields are applied-oriented:\nmaterial science, computer science, engineering\n- If a Univ. supports technical advance - how\nchanneled to nations firms? Some argue it isnt\n- 3. Government Labs\n- US govt. labs key to advance in agriculture, health,\nnuclear energy - they act via public service missions\n- [Govt. labs substitute in many countries for Univ.\nresearch - Korea, Finland]\n\n8) InnovationInstitutional ActorsCont\n- 4. Public Sector Support for Industry R&D\n- Controversial in the US, assumed everywhere else in\nworld.\n- In US-industrial R&D is rationalized under govt. agency\nmission - ie, defense R&D with industry- for defense\nThere are Inter-industry Differences in Innovation\nActors:\n*affected by role of suppliers/users, etc.\n*no standard model\n*in complex technologies: supply chain and\ncustomer/users play role in innovation; also-\n*component and systems producers\n*So: innovation networks: - result of a\ncommunity of actors\n\n9) Comparison - U.S./Japan\nInnovation Systems:\n- 45-75 US Innovation System :\n- US firms larger in scale/serving continental sized markets\n- US firms spend more on R&D\n- US govt spends more on R&D, via defense mission\n- US Univ. research stronger - better connected to industry than\nin Europe - tied to strong public financing for Univ. R&D after\nWW2\n- Most US goods sold into US market - little export orientation\n- Note: US research Univs (Hopkins, Columbia are first) are\nmodeled on German Univ.s; R&D of US chemical industry\n(first large scale industry R&D) modeled on Germany\n- 70s-80s Japan Innovation System Model:\n- Resource poor so strong export orientation since 1880s\n- R&D more tied to industry\n- Govt via MITI has explicit technology development policy\n\n10) Country Innovation System\nDifferences:\n- 3 Basic Categories of Countries:\n- 1) Large high income countries\n- Large fraction of economy in R&D-oriented industries\n- 2) Small high income countries\n- 3) Lower income countries\n- Countries without resources have export orientation -\nGermany, Japan, Korea\n- National security imputed to/connected to innovation\nsystem - in US,UK, France\n- Defense R&D is majority of govt industrial R&D\n- Japan - industrial cartel structure set with high industry R&D\npre-WW2 period\n- Differences in govt role:\n- US, UK - limited govt role in industrial R&D outside defense\n- Low income countries and resource short, export-driven\ncountries - large govt industrial R&D role\n\n11) What Leads to Innovation Success?\n- KEY FACTOR: STRONG FIRMS (not\nnecessarily large), highly competent in:\n- product design,\n- management,\n- fitting consumer needs,\n- linked to upstream suppliers and downstream\nmarkets,\n- access to investment,\n- -must compete in world markets to be strong, &\n- -the bulk of their innovation has to be by firms\nthemselves [even if networked to others]\n\n12) Other Key Innovation Success\nFactors:\n- EDUCATION & TRAINING - science-based industry\ndepends on univ. ed. - key govt role here\n- Hightech sector requires broad base of educated talent in and\noutside R&D\n- Korea, Taiwan - education led growth\n- FISCAL, MONETARY, TRADE POLICY - key govt role\n- PUBLIC SUPPORT OF UNIV. OR GOVT LAB\nRESEARCH -\n- Critical in key fields - ex., electronics\n- For univ. or govt labs - key is direct interaction between\nfirms or groups of firms and particular researchers or\nresearch programs - you want a technological community\n- Role of defense research - key to US success in electronics,\ncomputing, semiconductors, aerospace - but declining\nspillover because US military has shifted from new\ngeneric technology to specific hardware - And note: US\npublic R&D funds much lower outside defense\n\n13) Q: What About Explicit Govt\nHigh Tech Innovation Role?\n- Backdrop: High tech advance key to high wages, high skills,\ntop competitive management ability\n- Innovation System Goal: create systematic technical advance\nin series of areas\n- Much value occurs downstream in industries incorporating\nthese advances\n- Active govt policies can be effective in generating competitive\nadvantage in tech advances and are comparatively low cost\n- And - these active govt policies can play a role in helping an\nindustry take advantage of upstream technology advances\n- Overall - advances in key tech sectors are building blocks\nfor advances in downstream industries, as well as upstream\n\nREPEAT: MENU OF DIRECT/EXPLICIT\nU.S. INNOVATION SYSTEM FACTORS:\n- DIRECT/EXPLICIT - GOVT -\n- Univ.

Bonvillian\nMIT\nSTS.081/17.395\nInnovation Systems for\nScience, Technology,\nMfg., Health and Energy\n\nPaul Samuelson on\nComparative Advantage\nImage courtesy of Innovation & Business Architectures, Inc. Used under CC-BY.\n\nPaul A. Samuelson, late Prof. Of Economics, MIT\n(Nobel Prize 1972), Where Ricardo and Mill Rebut\nand Confirm Arguments of Mainstream\nEconomists Supporting Globalization\nJour. of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 18, No. 3 (Summer 04)\n- Mainstream economists (Alan Greenspan, Jagish Bhagwati,\nGregory Mankiw, etc.) argue re Globalization:\n- Yes, good jobs may be lost in the short run, but still total US\nnet national product must by economic laws of comparative\nadvantage be raised in the long run (and in China, too)....\nNever forget the real gains of consumers alongside admitted\npossible losses of some producers in this working out of what\nSchumpeter called creative capitalist destruction.\n- Correct economic law recognizes that some American groups\ncan be hurt by dynamic free trade. But correct economic law\nvindicates the word creative destruction by its proof that the\ngains of the American winners are big enough to more than\ncompensate the losers.\n- But Samuelson says: The last paragraph can only be an\ninnunendo For it is dead wrong about the necessary suply of3\nwinnings over losings\n\nSamuelson: Capturing\nComparative Advantage\n- Q: How can the US be a loser in trade with a low cost, low\nwage competitor like China despite the Ricardos theory of\ncomparative advantage?\n- A: Ex.: If China begins to make productivity enhancing\ngains in its production, and couples that with its low wages,\nit can capture some of the comparative advantage that\nbelonged to the US through its productivity dominance\n[note: US still the most productive economy in the world]\n- Then -- in a Ricardo analyis, there is never any\nunemployment that lasts forever from trade - So it is not\nthat US jobs are ever lost in the long run; it is that the new\nlabor-market clearing real wages has been lowered by this\nversion of dynamic fair trade.\n- In other words, US wages can drop after a time to a point\nwhere Chinas productivity enhancement is offset. The US\nstill has a benefit from lower prices for goods, but there are\nnow new net harmful US terms of trade\n\nSamuelson: Economic history is\nreplete with the story of capturing\ncomparative advantage:\n- Example: Farming moves from east US to\nmidwest two centuries ago\n- Example: Textile and shoe mfg. moved from\nnew England to the low-wage South early last\ncentury\n- Example: English mfg. leaadership shifted to the\nUS starting in the middle of the 19th century\n- Even where the leaders continued to progress\nin absolute growth, their rate of growth tended to\nbe attenuated by an adverse headwind\ngenerated from low wage competitors and other\ntechnical imitators.\n\nSamuelsons conclusions:\n- So: a productivity gain in one country can\nbenefit that country alone, while permanently\nhurting the other country by reducing the gains\nfrom trade possible between the two\ncountries - all this is long run\nSchumpeterian [the creative destruction of\ncapitalism] effects\n- There is a roulette wheel of evolving\ncomparative advantage in a world of free\ntrade\n- Comparative advantage cannot be counted\non to create...net gains greater than the net\nlosses from trade\n- But if you respond with tariffs and\nprotectionism, you may be breeding\neconomic arteriosclerosis\n\nGary Pisano and Willy Shih\n(Harv.Bus.

Manufacturing is not\nAgriculture\n- For a long time we thought manufacturing was agriculture.\n- In 1900 half our populations was farming; now less than 2%\nare farming\n- We are producing more than ever so have had enormous\n\"Productivity gains' in agriculture\n- But the MIT report tells us this manufacturing is not agriculture\n- We lost 5.8 million manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010\n- We thought manufacturing output was holding firm, but it wasn't\non reexamination we're finding it was in decline\n- So we didn't the productivity gains we thought we got\n- Our job loss tells us our manufacturing sector is hollowing out\nnot getting more productive\n\nStory Two: Home Alone\n- The MIT report tells us for the past three\ndecades we have been thinning out our\nmanufacturing sector\n- We used to have firms and supply chains that were very\nvertically integrated\n- We hit on a financial model of emphasizing quarterly\nreturns, which led us to reduce risk by making our firms\n\"core competency\" and \"asset light\"\n- So the shared assets of training, bringing best practices to\nsuppliers, thinned out\n- The companies in our system are now much more \"home\nalone\"\n\nStory Three: The Scale Up Problem\n- We have three manufacturing sectors\n- Big multinationals - they are global, they can get production\nefficiencies by producing in lower cost countries and they must be in\nall the global markets\n- They're OK, although they are increasingly producing abroad\n+ Two More Vulnerable Sectors:\n- Main Street firms - they do most of our manufacturing, there are\n300,000 small and mid-size firms\n-\n-They have trouble getting production scale up funding, they're thinly\ncapitalized, must be risk adverse to survive, and don't do R&D\n(although they can be very innovative about process)\n-\nOur entrepreneurial startups that make something -\n- they do well until they have to scale up for production of their\nproduct - they lack financing for scale- up here - Venture firms\ndon''t fund this - send startups to contract mfgs. In Asia\n- So they turn to contract manufacturers abroad\n\nPrivate Industrial R&D Funding in the US by Company Size (1957 - 2014)\n200,000\n150,000\n100,000\n50,000\n2016 Constant US Dollars (Millions)\nPoint:\nBig co's do\nR&D not\nSmall co's -\n- Limits\ninnovation\naccess\n5,000-25,000+\nEmployees\n500-4,999\nEmployees\n100-499\nEmployees\n<100\nEmployees\nFrom: Anna\nMuszynski,\nMIT Lincoln\nLab\nSources: \"Domestic R&D Funded by Companies Doing Business in the US\" 2014 - The NSF Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS), in press; 2008 to 2013 - The NSF Business R&D and\nInnovation Survey (BRDIS), https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvyindustry/; 1980 to 2007 - The NSF Survey of Industry R&D (SIRD), https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/iris/\n\nStory Four: The Tie between\nInnovation and Production\n- So what if they scale up abroad? What's the\nproblem?\n- Because for most products you need to tie\ninnovation very closely to initial production\n- You need dense feedback loops as you do product\ndesign- initial production requires very creative\nengineering and design - it's part of innovation\n- So if you shift production capability, in many cases\ninnovation capability has to follow it\n- Innovation is the U.S. strong suit - it's what we do\nbest\n- But the MIT report finds that if many of our\nimportant innovations have to follow production,\nthen we are endangering our innovation strength\n- And Innovation is the key factor in growth\n\nStory Five: Workforce\n- MIT study surveyed 3000+ manufacturing firms\n- 75%: filled job vacancies in less than a month\n- There is no emergency on workforce talent\n- After all, we laid off 5.8m workers in last decade\n- But the 25% is interesting\n- Innovative firms requiring higher job skills in this\ngroup\n- If we want to move to advanced mfg., increasing\nskills key\n- And: Big demographics problem - aging workforce\n\nStory Six: What Germany can teach\nus\n- We thought that we had to lose manufacturing jobs to\nlow cost producers in Asia because we are high wage.\n- But Germany is high wage and high cost - German\nwages and benefits are 66% higher than the U.S.\n- They run a major manufacturing surplus, including a\nmanufacturing surplus with China\n- The MIT team went to Germany and interviewed a wide\nrange of their firms to try to understand their system\n- They have a deep ecosystem for their manufacturers,\nsmall and large - they aren't \"home alone\"\n- Extensive collaborative R&D shared by industry- gov't\nuniversities around manufacturing technologies and\nprocesses\n- Shared training system for their workforce\n- Ways to link their supply chains for rapid scale up\n- Some German practices won't apply here, but some22do\n\nStory Seven: Jobs - the manufacturing\nsector affects our services sector\n- U.S.: 80% \"services\" economy\n- But increasingly - the 21st century firm ties\ncomplex products to services - to offer \"solutions\"\n- Tradeable goods are tied to services, which\nmakes the service tradeable\n- Personal services are face to face, don't scale\n- But with the tradeable good, you can scale both\nthe good and the service\n- So: success in production increasingly tied to\nsuccess in services, & vice versa\n- Scaling is how an economy grows\n- Lose the product, can't scale the service either\n\nServices vs. Manufacturing -\nemployment/economic roles:\n32%\n68%\n86%\n14%\nDeutsche Bank Research 2015\nImage created by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nSummary: The Seven Stories -\n- Manufacturing is not Agriculture\n- Our Manufacturing Firms are Increasingly \"Home\nAlone\"\n- The Scale-Up problem for small, mid-sized, and\nstart-up firms - most of U.S. manufacturing\nproduction strong\n- Close linkage between innovation/production\n- Workforce: to move to adv'd mfg., need skills training\n- Germany's lesson on strong mfg. ecosystem\n- Jobs - tie tradeable goods to tradeable services for\nscaleable growth\n- (How our manufacturing sector affects our services sector)\n\nW.B.

Why\ninvest in innovation here if gains elsewhere?\n-\nLast 25 years - IT/electronics allowed severing of\nR&D/design from production via IT-based specs;\ncommodity goods, too\n- Distributed Manufacturing - Apple iPod example\n-\nBut other sectors still require deep connection\nbetween R&D and production - constant\nreengineering and improvements to cut costs\n\nMind the Connection between R&D/Design\nand Production in Different Sectors\n- IT goods can sever R&D/design & production\n-\nElectro-mechanical-aero-pharma-capital\ngoods- tie R&D/production- variables too complex\n- RISK - \"Innovate There/Produce There\"\n- If Distributed Mfg.: risk losing production;\n- But the rest: offshore production, will\ndesign/innovation follow?\n- Underlying all this: Competing with low cost/wage high\ntech competitors: must have productivity gains\n- That means new innovation required: technology and\nprocesses\n\nSuppose US decided it wanted\nto go back to Production\nLeadership...\n- Need a strategy\n- Need to understand key factors we do\nnot understand now\n- What do we need to understand?\n\nStep 1: New Manufacturing\nParadigms\n- Historically, shifts in manufacturing\nadvantage have stemmed from\nintroduction of:\n1. technology advances\n2. with accompanying process\nadvances\n3. and new business and\norganizational models\n\n1) Historical Examples of Shifts with Tech\nProcess-Business Model Sequence:\n1. US takes leadership of Industrial Revolution\nmid- 19th century through development of the\n\"American system\" of interchangeable\nmachine-made parts\n- Result of 20-year DOD technology\ndevelopment of precision machine tools at\nHarper's Ferry Arsenal\n2. Japan 1970's-80's - new quality price\ntradeoff, just in time inventory, making labor\nfixed price for labor flexibility\n3. US recaptures Semiconductor manufacturing\nlead in 80's - focus on mfg process -\nadvances in SC equip suppliers, roadmap\n\n1) What technology advances =\nnew manufacturing paradigms?\n- \"Network centric\"\n- mix of advanced IT, RFID, sensors in every stage and element,\ndatamining and recall; advanced robotics, supercomputing\nmodeling\n- Advanced materials\n- \"materials genome\" - ability with supercomputing to design all\npossible materials with designer features\n- Biomaterials, and bio assembly\n- Lightweighting everything\n- Nanomanufacturing\n- fabrication at the nano-scale\n- Mass Customization\n- Production of one at cost of mass production\n- Distribution efficiency\n- IT advances that yield distribution efficiencies (incl. in supply\nchain)\n- Energy Efficiency - energy is \"waste\"\n\nStep 2 - Sectoral Evaluation\n- Manufacturing is sectoral, but with\nincreasing sectoral overlap for complex,\nhigh value goods\n- An airplane is aero design, electronics, IT,\nmaterials, etc.\n- Technology paradigms have to make\nsense in the sectors\n- Run a matrix - technology options\nagainst sectors they apply to - pick\ntechnologies with payoff across sectors\n- Include emerging sectors\n\n2) MATRIX: Tech Sectors/Mfg.

Hart, Forged Concensus-\nScience, Technology and Economic Policy in the\nU.S., 1921-1953 (Princeton Univ. Press 1998)\n- 5 Visions of the Liberal state and Governance\nof Technological Innovation, 1921-53\n- 1) CONSERVATISM:\n- Saw need for state to provide for defense,\nincluding military technological innovation\n- Goal: keep this sphere isolated from\ndomestic economy\n- Movement was reaction to the excesses of Wilsons\nWW1 mobilization - industrial controls\n\nDavid Hart, Forged Concensus, Cont:\n- 1) CONSERVATISM, cont:\n- Frank Jewett - an exponent of this direction- Pres.\nof Bell Labs, head of Natl Academy, 38\n- Felt federal meddling with R&D and patents laws\nwould slow growth of science advance\n- But: supported WW2 govt role in science\n- Postwar - supported retrenchment of govt role\n- Sen. Robert Taft - post-WW2 - military strategy was\nto control cost through limits on force size,\ntherefore dependant on tech. innovation and\nnuclear arsenal\n- Summary - govts defense science role and needs\nshould be isolated from domestic economy\n\nDavid Hart, Forged Concensus, Cont:\n- 2) ASSOCIATIONALISM:\n- Exponent: Herbert Hoover - engineer, war relief\norganizer, Commerce Sec., President\n- Saw the power of state action\n- Felt unlimited economic competition inhibited\ntech. innovation - price competition prevented risk\nof innovation - competition blocked large scale\nR&D because it fragmented industry\n- Associationalism originated in WW1 war\nmobilization\n- FDR adopts Hoovers associational idea - but his\nNRA is an organizational disaster - then Vannevar\nBush adopts this model for WW2 science and war\nmobilization\n\nDavid Hart, Forged Concensus, Con't:\n- 3) ASSOCIATIONALISM, con't:\n- The government's role:\n- Disseminate best practices to rationalize industry\ncontinuously\n- Foster industry-wide R&D facilities run by trade\nassociation supported by gov't\n- Or: gov't service agencies run these R&D facilities\n- Must be close ties between industry R&D managers\nand bench scientists\n- Basic idea: gov't industry cooperation, pool resources\ntogether, avoid duplication\n- Example: Hoover's Dept. of Commerce - the Bureau of\nStandards:\n- to reorganize 'sick\" industries with new technology\n- Build industry collaborative R&D\n- Tear down barriers that limit high growth industry\n\nDavid Hart. Forged Concensus, Cont\n- 3) REFORM LIBERALISM:\n- Espoused after NRA failure in 1935 (exponent -Henry\nWallace - Commerce Sec.)\n- Basic theory: reestablish markets by govt regulation\n(ex., antitrust )\n- Saw govt as an economic actor\n- Sought end of suppression of tech. innovation by cartels,\nmonopolies\n- State could develop and commercialize new technology\nitself, or\n- Break bottlenecks that hold back innovation\n- WW2 mobilization by joint associative govt-industry\neffort ended this movement\n- Post-WW2 - displaced by Keynesianism\n\nDavid Hart, Forged Concensus, Cont:\n- 4) KEYNESIANISM:\n- Emerged in 40s - (J.M. Keynes econ. theory)\n- basic view: govt spending to contribute liquidity to\nprivate markets, to spur demand\n- Debate over govt S&T role - 2 views conflict:\n- Tech innovation is logical result of private\ninvestment, only govt macro tools needed; vs.\n- Widespread market failures in provision of S&T -\nstate should correct by S&T investment\n- Korean War - resolved conflict - Keynesians argue\naggregate S&T spending, including defense R&D\nspending, benefits economy\n- Example: NSF R&D spending indicators - come\nfrom this macro orientation\n\nDavid Hart, Forged Concensus, Cont\n- 5) NATIONAL SECURITY STATE:\n- Emerged in WW2 and Cold War\n- Use any means/any model necessary to reach S&T\nleadership for defense needs\n- WW2 - associative state and national security state\nmerge\n- Led by Vannevar Bush in WW2\n- During the Cold War -\n- Congressional Repub. - Conservatives - wanted high tech\nforce (Air Force) - cheaper than mass force\n- Dem. Keynesians - military R&D was still R&D - contributed\nto aggregate R&D spending\n- Were they right???\n- Examples: aerospace, computing, electronics were\nresults\n\nDavid Hart, Forged Concensus, Cont:\n- REALITY: HYBRID GOVT S&T MODELS DOMINATE\nTHE LAST 50 YEARS, THROUGH THE END OF THE\nCOLD WAR:\n- We have a blend of different visions of the state role\n- The underlying conflict between positions goes\nunresolved; pragmatism reigns as usual; mix of:\n- Conservative - govt domestic R&D role - defense only;\nseparate sectors; private sector should play domestic\neconomy S&T role\n- Natl Security - use any model for S&T to gain military\nleadership\n- Associative - Hoover, FDR, Vannever Bush - latest:\nClintons public-private partnerships\n- Keynesian - aggregate R&D spending is key, defense and\nprivate sector adequate\n\nJennet Conant, Tuxedo Park\n(bio of Alfred L.

Ernest Lawrence of\nBerkeley, the leading US physicist\n- Vannevar Bush heads FDRs Natl Def. Res. Comm. - NDRC\n- Loomis is a radar experimenter, heads NDRCs microwave committee\n- is a Bush ally\n- 9/11/40 - in his Wardman Park Hotel suite Loomis develops British\nTizard Mission trust - British brief him on cavity magnetron- he sees\nvalue of microwave radar magnetron immediately\n- 9/28/40 at his Tuxedo Park Lab, British give Loomis cav mag #`12\n\nJennet Conant, Tuxedo Park, Cont\n- LOOMIS INVENTS THE FFRDC\n- The day after seeing the magnetron, Loomis works on the\nidea of a civilian scientist run lab with contract to DOD\n- later called Federally Funded R&D Center-FFRDC\n- British using similar system under Tizard\n- Loomis sees incredible promise of microwave radar -\nEngland is being night-bombed, has no defense, U-boats\non verge of starving Eng. - microwave radar can be\nmounted on a plane and defend against both\n- Immediately proposes a large central microwave lab\n- Civilian scientist controlled, not military controlled\n- To take scientists from both Univs and industry\n- Draws on British lab model\n- Loomis knows the value of tech leadership - the boat\nahead gets the new breeze first, just because it is ahead\nand thereby increases its lead.\n- Loomis immediately moves to set up this lab - gets\napprovals from the NDRC Microwave Comm, Sec.\nStimson and Gen. Marshall the next day\n\nJennet Conant, Tuxedo Park, Con't\n- LOOMIS INVENTS THE FFRDC, Cont:\n- Loomis immediately invents the 3 major R&D tasks for\nthe new lab -\n- Airborne interception (AI)\n- Gun-laying for antiaircraft weapons (GL)\n- Long range aircraft navigation (becomes Loran)\n- Loomis the next day recruits Ernest Lawrence (Loomis\nhas been funding his Berkeley accelerator experiments)\nto start up the lab and start phoning and hire the finest\nphysics talent in the US\n- Loomis, not even a govt ee, authorizes contracts for\nmagnetron by the end of the weekend\n- By Oct. - finest US physics talent joins the new lab\n- INCREDIBLE SPEED OF DEVELOPMENT\n\nJennet Conant, Tuxedo Park, Cont\n- Loomis Invents the FFRDC, Cont\n- Bell Labs Frank Jewett tries to locate at his co. - Loomis,\nwith MITs Compton, V.Bush, Harvard's James Conant,\noutmaneuvers him and locates at MIT\n- Becomes Rad Lab - Radiation Lab - over name since\natomic research viewed as long term and not war-\nrelevant\n- Loomis sets up unprecedented partnership: between\ngovt.-univ.-industry\n- Loomis and friend Ernest Lawrence of Berkeley use their\nrespect with physicist friends to recruit great talent\n- 11/11/40 - first meeting of Rad Lab researchers at MIT\n- Farmed out separate component mfg. to industry and all\ndeadlines met as of 11/11/40, so could focus on\nintegrating a system\n\nJennet Conant, Tuxedo Park, Con't\n- CHARACTERISTICS OF RAD LAB - Model for the Postwar\nFFRDC:\n- GREAT TALENT\n- 10 Nobel prizes go to Rad Lab scientists\n- FLEXIBLE FUNDING:\n- Loomis himself advances the funds for start-up\n- Contracting with industry is non- bid; Loomis just awards - there's a war\n- LOOSE, INFORMAL ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL\n- Non-bureaucratic org., loose, interacting groups teams Leadership based\nsolely on talent\n- \"easy comraderie\"; casual tone; interactive\n- \"long hours\"\n- Almost all scientists - few in support staff - at first, 36 scientists, 1 secretary\n- ABILITY OF LAB HEAD TO GO TOP\n- Loomis heads Microwave Comm above Rad Lab - reports officially to V.\nBush of NDRC - Lee Dubridge (later Caltech Pres)heads Rad Lab on site\n- BUT- Loomis frequently goes directly to War Sec.

Parringtons concept of the role of the\nfrontier in American life\n- Proposes new science frontier as next American frontier\n\nVannevar Bush, Science the Endless Frontier, Con't:\n- BACKGROUND:\n- V. Bushs paper comes out in July 1945 after FDRs\ndeath - it is the most influential policy paper ever\nwritten on US science organization\n- V.Bush is thinking through the postwar model for US\nscience, thinking about the govts future role\n- The Associationalist model dominates WW2\n- V.Bush dis-agregates science away form this model\n- Probably convinced politics will dismantle the WW2 model of\nintegrated research and development\n- Wants to salvage basic research for a govt role\n- Concerned that applied science dominated WW2 - sees need\nto restore basic science\n\nVannevar Bush, \"Science, The Endless Frontier\",\nCon't:\n- V. Bushs Report Defines the Future Direction of\nUS Science Progress:\n- Bush announces new popular causes for US Science\n- Science is to be part of a team for health, security,\nprosperity -\n- separates science as a separate player from other\ninnovation actors - against integrated model for science\n- Announces 3 goal areas for science:\n- 1) War Against Disease Direction:\n- Bush and FDR saw huge medical gains in WW2\n- Antibiotics key - reduced disease, cut death from\ndisease in WW2 to .6/1000, from WW1 of 14,1/1000\n- Health provides new public purpose for science\n\nVannevar Bush, \"Science, The Endless Frontier\",\nCon't:\n- 2) National Security Direction:\n- Pre-Cold War, but argues military research in peacetime\nvital for US security, cant rely on allies (lesson of WW2\npreparedness)\n- But insists on Loomis Rad Lab approach - must be\ncivilian control of defense science, with close liaison\nto military\n- Because NSF is not formed until after Cold War starts,\nNSF never assigned defense R&D\n- 3) Public Welfare Direction:\n- Goal is full employment - big postwar anxiety\n- Proposes idea that basic research is public capital\n- science role is to add capital, value to innovation\nsystem, not to dominate it or be integrated into it\n- 4) Nurture Talent Direction:\n- Bush envisions govt role in educating science talent\n\nVannevar Bush, \"Science, the Endless Frontier\",\nCon't:\n- Bush has a pipeline theory of innovation:\n- Science with govt backing will contribute basic\nresearch, not applied\n- Industry will apply it to practical problems\n- Govt role is to increase scientific capital by\nsupporting academic research\n- This form of research is removed form pressure for\nimmediate tangible results\n- Bushs idea: remove science from the fray - protect it,\nput it back into the ivory tower\n- Is that a good idea?\n\nVannevar Bush, \"Science, The Endless Frontier\",\nCon't:\n- Bushs Vision of Postwar Govt Role in Science\n- Sharply limited from WW2 role he oversaw\n- Support for science talent development\n- Offer industry an R&D tax deduction\n- Reform the patent system\n- Govt should also develop mechanisms to disseminate\nscience advances to industries outside the reach of\nscienct\n- Notes that a big backlog of APPLIED science advance\nfrom WW2 efforts are available to solve practical\nproblems\n- Govt should lift the lid and enable industry to access\n- Opening new frontiers is historical US govt role -\nextends concept for opening frontiers to justify govt\nscience role - but limited and controlled role\n\nSummary of PART ONE Readings:\n- DAVID HART: STORY ONE:\n- Explains the political currents behind defining the\ngovt role in support for science/R&D\n- Associationalist theory still battling with\nConservative/National Security movements\n- LOOMIS AND V.BUSH: STORY TWO - WW2 LEADS\nTO NEW MODEL\n- Bush and Loomis unify US Science R&D under\nBushs NRDC and its successor OSRD\n- Even though they are funded by the military, they\nreact against the militarys WW1 role and create a\nnew civilian controlled model\n\nSummary of PART ONE, Cont\n- STORY 2, Cont - Loomis sets of the Rad Lab\nR&D center outside not just Defense but outside\nthe govt, at MIT\n- FFRDC - Loomis invents this model and it is a\nkey to how US science will evolve post- WW2 -\ncivilian scientist control, flexible org.\n- organized in loose teams, fast and flexible R&D\ncontracting, great talent, non-bureaucratic\n- Bush unifies US science under a central\ndirectorate (ie, Bush); Loomis unifies basic and\napplied research in the non-govt FFRDC R&D\ncenter\n\nSummary of PART ONE, Cont\n- STORY THREE: POSTWAR SHATTERS THE UNITY\n- The immediate postwar shatters the unified science\norganization that Bush and Loomis created\n- Bush himself dismantles it - thats one message in his famous\nmanifesto Science, The Endless Frontier - Bush decides\nthat Govt should only support basic research - walks away\nfrom the applied/basic mix he and Loomis set up at Rad Lab\nand Manhattan Proj.\n- He tries to unify science research at NSF but his fight with\nTruman stalls it\n- SO: by the early cold war - unity of science research is broken\nand the unity of basic and applied science research is broken\n\nPART TWO: Org. History of US\nR&D Innovation Actors:\n-THE COLD WAR AND\nTHE EVOLUTION OF\nUS SCIENCE\nORGANIZATION:\n\nWilliam A. Blanpied, \"Inventing US Science\nPolicy\" (nsf.gov 1998)\n- Article portrays the battle between the Truman\nAdministration and Vannevar Bush on the\nDirection and Organization of US Science\n- V.Bush's \"Science the Endless Frontier\":\n- \"astonishing recommendation to set up a new agency\nthat would publicly fund all basic research, including\nmedical and military research performed inside and\noutside of gov't labs\"\n- \"bold and novel proposition that the US gov't has both\nthe right and responsibility to support self-directed\nbasic research by academic scientists\"\n- Gov't support of science activity, not gov't seeking\nscience support for its policy - reversal of policy\n- Bush proposed having scientists control agency with\nvery curtailed Admin. role\n\nHarry Truman vetoes Bush's NSF Act\nin 1946 - \"The Buck Stops Here\"\nThis image is in the public domain.\n\nBlanpied, Inventing US Science Policy, Con't:\n- Steelman Report - 1947\n- John Steelman, small college prof., the first Presidential Special\nAsst, helped resolve coal miner and railroad labor disputes\n- Steelman report came out three months after Truman vetoed Bushs\nNSF plan in 1946\n- Much more detailed than V.Bushs Manifesto\n- Rather than the let science alone laissez faire approach of V.Bush,\nSteelman proposed an integrated system of R&D, with central\ncoordination of fed. R&D agencies, and connections with industry\n- Academic research was one part of a coordinated larger R&D\nenterprise - but the major federal focus would be on basic research\n- Foresaw competitiveness battles where US R&D would be important\n- Steelmans Committee proposed:\n- doubling US R&D expenditures in a decade\n- US R&D expenditures should be 1% of GDP\n- Percentage allocations of federal R&D $ to policy areas\n- Systematic talent needs assessment\n- Central coordination of R&D through Exec. Off. of the President\n\nBlanpied, Inventing US Science Policy, Con't:\n- Bush opposed the Associationalist features of Steelman\nReport, and his stronger Presidential role which he feared\nwould politicize science\n- Steelman report, however, was a more accurate predictor of\nwhat organizational structure would evolve\n- Most interesting feature of Bush Report is that it proposed\na single, centralized science agency to support all basic\nresearch\n- But the 5-year delay in adopting a modified NSF with a\nPresidential role acceptable to Truman meant that US\nscience would be decentralized - other agencies moved to\nfill the void: ONR, AEC (which inherited the old\nManhattan Project), NIH\n- We rationalize the pluralistic R&D approach now but it\nlargely occurred by bureaucratic timing and default\n\nBlanpied, Inventing US Science Policy, Con't:\n- Congress didnt take NSF seriously during the\nearly Cold War - left it drastically under-funded\ncompared to proposals\n- Sputnik in 1957 led public, media & Congress to\nconclusion that academic basic research might\ncontribute to US Cold War success\n- This led to 3X increase in NSF funding\n- Sputnik led Eisenhower to implement many of the\nSteelman type of recommendations - particularly\nthe Presidential Sci. Advisor, the Presidents Sci.\nAdvisory Council\n- But the lack of centralized science coordination in\nthe V.Bush plan because it wasnt passed in 45\nto 46 may well have created a permanent problem\nfor US science coherence\n\nPeter Singer, \"...22 Examples of Major\nTechnology Advances that Stem from\nFederal Research Support\" (ITIF 2014)\n- Federal research support critical to the\ndevelopment of array of advanced\ntechnologies\n- Without it, hard to see how these\ntechnologies would evolve\n- So - basic research support remains critical\n- Key enabler in U.S. comparative advantage\nin radical/breakthrough technologies\n\nPeter Singer, 22 Examples...Con't\n- Examples:\n- Information Technology\n- Google Search Engine - NSF\n- GPS - Navy (Atomic Clocks), DOD (Navstar),\nDARPA\n- Supercomputers - DOE Nat'l Labs\n- Speech Recognition - DARPA\n- ARPANet - DARPA\n- Closed Captioning - NIST\n- Smartphone tech's - DOD, NSF, SBIR, etc.\n- Energy\n- Shale Gas/ Seismic Imaging - DOE Nat'l Labs\n- LEDs - USAF\n\nPeter Singer, 22 Examples..., Con't\n- Examples, con't\n- Health\n- MRIs - NIH (diffusion tensor imaging), NSF\n- Advanced Prosthetics - VA, DARPA\n- Human Genome - NIH\n- AIDS - NIH, expedited FDA approvals\n- Math\n- Reverse Auctions - NSF\n- Kidney Matching Program - NSF\n- Transportation\n- Civil Aviation - Army and Navy\n- Agriculture\n- Hybrid corn (USDA - Conn.

Stokes, Pasteurs Quadrant, Basic\nScience and Technological Innovation (Brookings\n1997)\n- The relationship between science and govt was\ntransformed by WW2\n- US prewar had some federal science entities - USGS,\nagriculture experiment station - pursued agency\nmissions\n- Had nascent research Univs on the Germon model\n- During interwar years, Univ. science concerned it might\nlose its autonomy\n- V. Bushs OSRD (Office of Scientific Research and\nDev. - successor to NDRC) was the nearest thing\nto a true central science org. in all of American\nhistory\n- Unparalled flow of funding into basic as well as applied\nscience - esp. nuclear physics, electronics\n\nDonald Stokes, Pasteur's Quadrant, Con't\n- V. Bushs OSRD:\n- V. Bushs OSRD appealed to FDRs love of creating\ninitiatives outside of regular gov't\n- Bush and allies Compton, Loomis, Conant grasped\nthat the war would be technology and science based\nconflict in significant part\n- Bush worked with FDR through his legendary aide\nHarry Hopkins - had access to the Pres.\n- OSRD part of the exec Office of the President\n- OSRD contracted for science work, didnt set up\nown labs\n- Leadership from the scientific elite and elite science\ninstitutions\n\nDonald Stokes, Pasteurs Quadrant, Cont\n- POSTWAR SCIENCE:\n- Sen. Harley Kilgore (W.Va.) sponsored first bill for\npostwar science organization in 42 - science\ndidnt have the leading voice in his agency\n- Bushs goals - federal support of basic science, but\ncurtail govt control of the performance of that\nresearch\n- Bush aimed to create an entity with cross-science\nauthority as broad as OSRDs in WW2\n- Director would be chosen by a board of scientists,\nnot named by Pres. and Senate- confirmed\n\nDonald Stokes, Pasteurs Quadrant, Cont\n- Stokes Argues Bushs Basic Research Cannon Has\nTwo Parts:\n- It is Performed Without Thought Of Practical\nEnds\n- Designed To Persuade Country That Attempts To\nConstrain Free Creativity Of The Basic Scientist Would\nBe Inherently Self-defeating\n- Basic Research Is The Pacemaker Of\nTechnological Improvement\n- Designed To Persuade The Policy Community That\nInvestment In Basic Science Would Yield The\nTechnology To Solve A Broad Spectrum Of National\nNeeds\n\nDonald Stokes, Pasteurs Quadrant, Cont\n- BUSHS ORGANIZATIONAL PLAN IS DEFEATED\n- Truman rejects scientist control of NSF - insists on\nPres. Appointment, general control\n- Congress, completely geography protective,\nsuspicious of elitist funding distribution\n- The 5-year delay fragments the overall science\nportfolio Bush envisions for NSF\n- ONR, AEC stood up; NIH gets OSRDs medical\nresearch contracts\n- BUT: BUSHS BASIC SCIENCE IDEALOGY\nTRIUMPHS\n\nDonald Stokes, Pasteurs Quadrant, Cont\n- WHY BUSHS BASIC SCIENCE IDEALOGY\nTRIUMPHS\n- Bushs Postwar Bargain - if govt funds basic science, I\npromise you technological progress\n- NSFs Univ. constituents love the idea that pure research is\nthe font of technological progress - enables them to\nprovide social rationale for basic research to justify federal\nfunding\n- Sputnik proves how deeply Bushs ideology spread - the\nAmerican answer to Sputnik is not only an applied science\nspace race, but huge new investments in basic science\n- DOD: Project Hindsight: 1 in 100 defense basic research\nprojects result in weapons system advance\n- NSF - its whole rationale is challenged - showed the\nantecedents of 5 selected technological innovations were\nbasic science-based\n\nDonald Stokes, Pasteurs Quadrant, Cont\n- But - NSF was just Showing What Could Be\nTrue - Tech. Advance Could Come From Basic\nResearch\n- Both DOD And NSF Continue To Think In\nLinear Model\n- DOD: All That Mattered Is Linear Segment\nOf: Applied To Dev To Production\n- NSF: All That Matters Is Linear - Basic To\nApplied To Dev. To Production\n- The Ideal Of Pure Inquiry Under Bushs\nCannons Dates From Classical Greek Science\n- Bush Paradigm Of The Linear Relation\nBetween Science and Tech Stokes Argues\nBears No Relationship To Their True\nConnection\n\nDonald Stokes, Pasteurs Quadrant, Cont\n- But: The Ties Between Science And\nTechnology Arent Linear, They Are\nInteractive\n- Use-inspired Science Yields Both Basic And\nApplied Results\n- Bushs Effort On Behalf Of The Science\nCommunity To Preserve The Autonomy Of\nPublically-funded Science Led Him To Decry\nEfforts To Constrain The Creativity Of Basic\nResearch\n- But It Is Eventually Self-defeating Because\nIts Not The Right Model\n- Challenges To Bushs Idealogy Grew Insistent\nAs Us Needs Shifted From The Military To\nEconomic Sphere\n\nDonald E. Stokes, Pasteurs Quadrant, Con't\n- Vannevar Bushs model for govt funded\nundirected basic research, post WW2, was a\nSTATIC model, although he argued it would\nbe the pacemaker for technological\nprogress\n- basic research investment would capture the\ngain of tech progress\n- Bush paradigm found deep resonance in\nWestern classical philosophy of science as\nreason, and its other tradition, Francis\nBacons marriage of science with the\npractical arts\n- Bush short-circuited basic research from\nconsideration of use\n- His linear model was one-dimensional\n\nDonald Stokes, Cont\n- Bush belief: understanding and use are conflicting\ngoals, so basic and applied research must be\nseparated\n- applied research drives out pure-V.Bush\n- No wonder US has had historic trouble converting\nits leadership in technology inventions into\nproducts - Bush made this a suspect activity\n- Bushs segmented linear/pipeline model:\nBasic--> applied--> development--> production\n& operations\n\nDonald Stokes, Cont:\n- Stokes Test Case: Pasteur - the rise of\nmicrobiology\n- Pasteur sought a fundamental understanding,\nvia microbiology, of the process of disease\n- But he sought this through applied goals of\npreventing spoilage in various substances\nincluding milk, then pursuing anthrax in sheep,\ncholera in chickens, rabies in animals and\nhumans\n- As Pasteurs scientific studies became more\nfundamental, his inquiry became more applied\n\nStokes PASTEURS\nQUADRANT:\n- Consideration of Use?\nYes\nSearch for\nfundamental\nunder\nstanding\nNo\nNo\nPure basic\nresearch -\nEx- Nils Bohr\nReview of the\nparticulars not\nthe general\n-- early Darwin\nYes\nUse inspired\nbasic research -\nEx- Louis\nPasteur\nPure applied\nresearch -\nEx-Thomas\nEdison\n\nDonald Stokes, Cont\n- The deepest flaw in the V. Bush paradigm is that\ntechnology development flows one way, from\nscience to technology\n- BUT: there is a reverse flow - from technology to\nscience\n- Science is interactive - it is a whole, not\nsegregated\n- There is a growing amount of technology that\nflows from science, but the other way is strong:\n- For example - Semiconductors - fundamental\nresearch that is technology based - built from\natomic layer to atomic layer\n- Who reaps the technological harvest from science?\nU.S. reached technological leadership LONG\nBEFORE it reached science leadership\n\nDonald Stokes, Cont\n- The greatest strides in productive technology can be made by\nnations that lack science leadership - the US in the 20s, Japan\nin the 70s-80s\n- V.Bushs manifesto presents a paradox in the history of\nideas - history of science presents so many cases of\ninteractive applied and basic science, how did it become\nbelieved that these were in tension?\n- James B. Conant, Pres., Harvard - Bush Ally in WW2, first\nhead of Trumans Natl Sci. Bd.: No one can draw a sharp\nline between basic and applied research...we might do well to\ndiscard altogether the phrases...in their place I should put the\nwords programatic research and uncommitted research. It\nwould be safe to say all so-called applied research is\nprogramatic, but so, too, is much that is often labeled\nfundamental. - 1950\n\nDonald Stokes, Cont\n- The U.S., which owes so much for Bushs\nstunning science organizational work in WW2, to\nhis vision of how science could be mobilized and\nenergized, to the creation of the federally-funded\nresearch university - but lost so much from the\npostwar narrowness of his view of science -\nperhaps due to his fear of the power FDRs\nindustrial state\n- Deborah Shapley & Rustum Roy: What was lost,\nin a word, was the importance of applied science\nand engineering, and something else we shall call\npur-positive basic research...\n\nStokes Dynamic Model\nTechnology\nUnderstanding\nImproved\nImproved\nUnderstanding\nTechnology\nPure\nBasic\nResearch\nUse-\nInspired\nBasic\nResearch\nPurely-\nApplied\nR&D\nExisting\nExisting\n\nDonald Stokes, Cont\n- Eventually, Erich Bloch comes to NSF and is able to\nbring computing and sci/tech and engineering\ncenters - but the Upstairs-Downstairs damage to\nscience had been done\n- How much was revulsion against what the\nManhattan Project did to physics?\n- Block (and David Cheney): Technology that\nremains in the lab provides almost no economic\nbenefits. Technology that is applied only to govt\nmarkets such as defense, provides much smaller\neconomic benefits than technologies that contribute\nto success in the much larger commercial markets,\nand especially to the ever more important global\nmarkets.\n\nDonald Stokes, Closing\nManifesto, Cont\n- A clearer understanding by the scientific and\npolicy communities of the role of use-inspired basic\nresearch can help renew the compact between\nscience and government, a compact that must also\nprovide support for pure basic research.\n- Agendas of use-inspired basic research can be built\nonly by bringing together informed judgments of\nresearch promise and societal need.\n\nSUMMARY OF PART TWO, CLASS 5 --\n- BLANPIED ARTICLE - NSF DOES BASIC RESEARCH\n- NSF will not be a unifying agency for US science coordination -\nother agencies grow up\n- Although it undertakes some applied work in the 60s, it\nremains a basic research agency\n- [Same approach at NIH]\n- DONALD STOKES\n- Attacks whole concept of separating basic research\n- Wants \"use based\" research in addition\n- Argues that basic-only is not the way science evolves\n- Science is not linear, not a pipeline\n- Science is interactive between basic and applied\n- Suggests US made a great mistake in focusing three of its great\nscience agencies (NSF, NIH DOE OS) on basic-only model\n\n**Summary of PART TWO:**\n- BLANPIED ARTICLE - NSF DOES BASIC RESEARCH\n- NSF will not be a unifying agency for US science coordination -\nother agencies grow up\n- Although it undertakes some applied work in the 60s, it\nremains a basic research agency\n- [Same approach at NIH]\n- DONALD STOKES\n- Attacks whole concept of separating and focus on basic\nresearch\n- Argues that not the way science evolves\n- Science is not linear, not a pipeline\n- Science is interactive between basic and applied\n- Suggests US made a great mistake in focusing two of its great\nscience agencies (NSF, NIH) on basic-only model\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nSTS.081J / 17.395J Innovation Systems for Science, Technology, Energy,\nManufacturing and Health\nSpring 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

too many layers\n- More authority for NIH Director, increased\nresponsiveness, greater flexibility, opportunity\nfor coordination\n- Force justifications for adding any more boxes\n- unmanageable\n- Strengthen clinical research via public private\npartnerships & new center for this\n- Strategic Planning across stovepipes\n- For: Cross-cutting initiatives\n\nIOM Recommendations, Cont:\n- Cross-NIH budgeting for cross-cutting efforts\nwith 10% of budget based on Strategic Plans\n- Reconsider plans every two years\n- Multi-year, time-limited\n- Addl staff for Direcctor to jump-start these\n- Strengthen NIH Director - to control Strategic\nPlanning and Trans-agency initiatives\n- Create addl operations staff and capability\nfor Director\n\nIOM Recommendations, Cont:\n- Create an NIH DARPA -\n- Directors Special Projects Program\n- For: high-risk, exceptionally innovative, high\npayoff projects\n- $1b/year\n- Rapid review and initiation of promising\nprojects\n- Special extramural panels available to advise\n- Program Director reports to NIH Director\n- Project not peer review based\n\nIOM Recommendations, Cont:\n- Shape up the NIH intramural program -\nprogram metrics and accountability\n- Standardize data and info systems - ICs\nand researchers cant draw on each\nothers databases, no common metrics\n- Limit terms of NIH & IC Directors and set\npowers, require annual reviews\n\nIOM Recommendations, Cont:\n-Limit authority of Natl Cancer Institute\n- now separate, fit it within NIH\n-Retain integrity, quality of appts to\nAdvisory Comms - reform across\nNIH\n-Better funding for research\nmanagement\n\nMY COMMENTS ON IOM\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\nMAJOR NIH ORGANIZATIONAL\nPROBLEMS:\n- NIH not a connected organization, doesnt\nsupport connected research\n- Very hard to stand-up larger scale Grand\nChallenge Model approaches across NIH\n- Cannot set initiatives across stovepipes\n- almost no cross agency work (except Director Elias\nZerhouni's \"Roadmap\"/Common Fund)\n- Almost no coordination with outside agencies like\nArmy Med Res, DARPA, DHS HSARPA, little w/FDA\n- Primarily small grant research - but science\nadvance doesnt necessarily come from small\ngrants\n\nNIH Problems, Cont\n- Slow-moving - grant approvals can take a year or\nmore - cant respond to emerging problems\nquickly\n- -ex., biothreats, new infectious diseases\n- Peer review tends to avoid high-risk, high-payoff\napproaches\n- Conservative - missed SCs, genome, and Venters\nautomated genome processing\n- Focus on basic-only R&D works only if profound\nconnection to industry - but that isnt there\n- Weak tech transition office\n- Biotechs, Pharmas focused on blockbuster markets -\nsome say only 10% of health R&D aimed at 90% of\nworld disease problems\n\nNIH Problems, Cont:\n- NIH not organized for cross-disciplinary R&D\n- Advances will come from areas between\ndisciplines - ex., biotech\n- Physical science funding in decline\n- NIH will suffer from this decline, too - will limit\nlife science advance\n- NIH not organized to develop next generation\nof research tools - also critical to FDA\n- Benefited from simulation and modeling, but\nno work to develop next generation\n- Weak NIH Director cant set goals, manage 27\nmixed-performance ICs\n\nNIH Problems, Cont:\n- Cant tackle major new science opportunity areas\n- Nanotechnology - health is early winner but of\n$1.3b govt program, only $160 in 07 from NIH\n- still a problem\n- Drug-only focus of research omits huge fields -\nbioengineering (devices) center -NIBIB-stood up\nbut underfunded (only $300m/year)\n- Bioinfomatics still weak\n- Collins: NCATS for translational research being\ncreated but how will it connect to industry?\n\nSo: IOMs 03 Report Only\nCaptures Part of NIHs\nProblems\n\nRobert M.

Bush splits\nR from D\n- Stokes - US: Disconnected model - creates\ntech transition problem\n\nClass Six:\nClass 6:\n-How to cross the \"Valley of Death\"\n(Branscomb/Auerswald)?\n- Associationalist programs of 80s,\n90's\n-Is war necessary for economic\ngrowth? - Ruttan\n- In-Q-Tel - the most radical,\ninterventionist model - gov't VC\n\"picking winners and losers\"\n\nClass Seven:\n- Class 7 - Organization of\nInnovation at the Face to Face\nLevel\n- Innovation is people - not\ninstitutions\n- Great Group theory\n- Great group rule-sets: flat\ncollaborative non-hierarchial,\nmix of disciplines, room for\nleadership\n- The Third Direct Innovation\nFactor: Innovation Organization\n\nClass Eight:\n- Class 8 - DARPA as renewal of\nthe WW2 connected model\n- Combines institutional\nconnectedness and sponsors\ngreat groups\n- Operates at both levels of\ninnovation - institutional and\npersonal\n- Role of Technology Visioning\n(Carleton)\n\nClass Nine:\n- Class 9: Applying the Innovation\nFramework - NIH\n- A disconnected model - 27 Institutes and\nCenters - not cross-cutting\n- Basic research model, non\ninterdisciplinary\n- Pending 3rd Revolution - convergence -\ncan it adopt?\n- Institutional stovepipes vs.\nconnectedness\n- Can NIH sponsor great groups - then:\nability to scale?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nSTS.081J / 17.395J Innovation Systems for Science, Technology, Energy,\nManufacturing and Health\nSpring 2017\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

But it is important not to become\nbeguiled by the possibility of revolutionary\ntechnology. Humanity can solve the carbon and\nclimate problem in the first half of this century\nsimply by scaling up what we already know how\nto do - Socolow and Pacala\n\nBonvillian and Weiss, Taking Covered\nWagons East (Innovations, MIT Press 2009 )\n- Need to get inside the black box of energy\ninnovation\n- Govt already deeply interventionist\n-\nregulatory, subsidies to fossil and renewables\n- Political parties:\n- R: nuclear, domestic oil production, natural gas - subsidies\n- D: renewable subsidies\n- Both: missing coherent energy technology policy\n- Overlap: some agreement on new energy technologies\n- Few new energy technologies technological\nand economically ready for implementation\n- Policy consensus on need for new technologies, but\nfew detailed attempts on how to implement them\n\nScale and Price Issues in\nEnergy\n- New energy technologies must land in a\ncomplex, established sector\n- A techno-economic-political paradigm\n- Private sector R&D discourage by wild price\nosvillations in energy prices\n- Oil $20/barrel 1998, $140/barrel 2008, ~$35/b 2016\n- Public sector - 40 years of R&D yet few\ntechnologies have transitioned\n- Need for parallel and supporting policies on price\nand on technology supply\n\nA Public Strategy for Energy\nTechnology Should be...\n- Very Large in Scale and Scope\n- The problem of energy is scale\n- Comparable to Apollo Project in Size and Scope\n- But NOT in Form or Organization\n- Private Sector Led\n- Public-Private Partnerships\n- Technology Neutral\n- Avoid technology lock-in\n- The opposite of the present pattern of subsidies to\nspecific subsidies with powerful lobbies\n- No Lobbyist Left Behind\n- Organized around Obstacles to Market Launch\n\nThe Underlying Innovation Dynamics\nModels: Pipeline, Induced, Extended Pipeline,\nMfg.-Led, and Innovation Organization\n- Energy requires new unified theory of\ninnovation\n- Model: Pipeline -\n- Vannevar Bush and WW2 - connected science\n- Technology push model\n- Federal research based\n- More research than development\n- radical/breakthrough research advance\n- Remember Branscomb/Auerswald - Its not\nreally a pipeline\n- In energy, we will need to strengthen our\npipeline model capability\n\nThe Innovation Dynamics, Con't\n- Model : Induced Innovation\n- Industry-led - industry identifies a market\nopportunity to be met with innovation\n- Typically incremental advance\n- Demand-Pull or Technology-Pull\n- More Development than Research\n- Developed by economist Vernon Ruttan\n- In energy, a carbon price can supply the\ndemand push factor\n- Note: \"Extended Pipeline\" and\n\"Manufacturing Led\" Innovation Models 18\n\nThe Innovation Dynamics, con't\n- Model: Innovation Organization Model\n- Management of innovation and the\ninstitutions and institutional arrangements\nrequired in this category\n- Technology push and Demand Pull are not\nenough in energy - will need new innovation\norganization\n- Will need in energy an integrated theory\nfeaturing all four models\n- Unlike IT, which was essentially tech push from DOD\n- Energy will require filling innovation\ninstitutional gaps\n\nSummary - so far\n- Bonvillian and Weiss:\n- The problems of scale,\n- and techno-eco-pol paradigm\n- and established complex sector\n- Technology neutrality\n- Integrating the Models of Innovation\n- Pipeline - technology push\n- Induced - demand pull\n- Extended Pipeline\n- Manufacturing-Led\n- Innovation organization\n- Energy demands all models be integrated, unified\n\nNext issue:\nScaling Energy Innovations\n- Investment Levels in Energy R&D:\n- US federal spending on R&D for new energy tech is\nabout half what it was in 1980\n- Energy declined from 10% of all US R&D in 1980\nto just 2% in 2005. (in 02 dollars)\n- Between 1980 and 2005, the US decreased its\nenergy R&D investment by 58%.\n- Federal Energy R&D spending level in 07 is less\nthan half the R&D spending of the largest US\npharmaceutical company.\n- Private sector R&D story is similar.\n\nUS Public and Private Trends in\nEnergy R&D: (Nemet and Kammen)\n\nUS Private Energy Sector R&D\nInvestment Compared to that into\nSectors with Significant Innovation\nInnovating industries\n- The biotech industry invests 39% of annual revenue,\n- pharmaceuticals invest 18%,\n- semiconductors invest 16%.\nEstablished industries:\n- electronics industry invests 8% of sales\n- auto industry invests 3.3%.\n- Average R&D/ann.rev., all US industry: 2.6%\n- Private Energy Sector: less than 1%\n\nIs an R&D Increase Justified?\n- Precedents for increased government spending\non similar scale (in 2002 dollars)\n- Apollo Program ($185 billion over 9 years),\n- Carter/Reagan defense buildup ($445 billion\nover 8 years),\n- Doubling NIH ($138 billion over 5 years)\n- Ballistic Missile Defense ($145 billion over the\nfirst 6 years - actual dollars).\nThese are examples of the needed size and scope\nof a technology development program (including\nimplementation), not the way such a program\nshould be organized\n\nIEA: OECD Countries\nSimilar R&D Decline\n\nIEA: Investments Required for CO2\nReductions are Large:\n- The International Energy Agency (IEA) 2008\nreport estimates\n- Reducing emissions to 50% below 2005\nlevels\n- the goal G-8 leaders committed to in July 2008,\n- will require a total worldwide investment of\n$45 trillion (todays dollars), or $1.1 trillion\nper year, in R&D and implementation\n- We arent close\n\n-- SO...\n- Lets just throw R&D money at it,\nright?\n- But: innovation in established,\ncomplex sectors like energy is a\nmuch more complicated\nproposition\n\n!\"#$%&'(&')&*+%&,-./'0&12\"#')3&\n!\"#$% '( ') *+% ,-./'0 12\"#')\nBecause the US is a\nCovered Wagon\nCulture\n!

Recommendations for Institutional Innovations to fill\nthese gaps\n\nA Program Commensurate with the\nScope of the Energy Problem\nRequires Leadership\n- This is the toughest\nTechnology\nImplementation task we\nhave faced\n- nothing else is close\n\nStep One: Identify\nTechnology Launch Categories\n1. Experimental technologies requiring long-term research\n-\nExamples: Fusion, Hydrogen Fuel Cells\n2. Potentially Disruptive innovations that can be launched in\nniche markets where they are competitive, and achieve\ngradual scale-up building from this base.\n-\nExamples: Solar PVs and wind for off-grid power,\nLEDs\n3. Secondary innovations - uncontested launch: components\nin larger systems that face immediate market\ncompetition based on price, but are acceptable to the\nsystem manufacturer.\n-\nExamples: Batteries for Plug-in Hybrids, Enhanced\nGeothermal\n\nEnergy Technology Launch\nCategories - Cont\n4. Secondary innovations - contested launch:\ncomponent innovations having inherent cost disadvantages and\nfacing political and non-market economic efforts to block their\nintroduction.\n- Examples: Carbon Capture and Sequestration, Biofuels,\nNuclear Power\nCrossover Categories:\n5. Conservation and end-use efficiency -- incremental\nimprovements for all technologies\nExamples: Improved IC engines, BuildingTechnologies,\nAppliance Standards\n6. Advances in manufacturing technology and scale-up of\nmanufacturing for all types of energy technology so as to drive\ndown production costs.\n- Examples: Wind energy, Carbon Capture and Sequestration\n\nStep Two: Policy Packages\nMatched to Launch Categories\n- (1) Front End Support:\n- Needed for all technologies\n- Examples - research and development (R&D),\ntechnology prototyping and demonstrations (P&D),\npublic-private R&D partnerships, monetary prizes to\nindividual inventors and innovative companies, and\nsupport for technical education and training\n- (2) Back End Incentives (carrots) to encourage technology\ndeployment:\n- Needed for secondary (component) technologies\n- Examples - tax credits for new energy technology\nproducts, loan guarantees, price guarantees,\ngovernment procurement programs, new product buy-\ndown programs\n\nStep Two, Cont - Policy Packages\nfor Promoting Energy Innovation\n- (3) Back End Regulatory and Related Mandates\n(sticks):\n- For secondary technologies - contested launch\n- Prospect of political battles since launch will be\ncontested\n- Examples: standards for particular energy\ntechnologies in building, construction, and\ncomparable sectors, renewable portfolio standards,\nfuel economy standards, emissions taxes, general\nand technology-specific intellectual property policies.\n- Need work on best tools for tech categories\n\nBonvillian and Weiss, Steps - Con't\n- STEP 3: Identify the Innovation System GAPS\n- Step 4: Fill these GAPS - content of Chapter 6\n- Need to identify the gaps on the:\n- FRONT END and\n- BACK END\nin the Innovation pipeline\n-- at every stage from: Research to Development to\nPrototype to Demonstration/Testbed to Deployment\nand commercial market\n\nStep Three: Identify the Gaps in\nExisting Energy Innovation System\n- Front-End - RD&D\n- Translating Research into Innovation\n- Carefully monitored demonstrations of\nengineering-intensive technologies (Carbon\nSequestration, Biofuel Processing)\n- Improved manufacturing processes\n- Back-End - deployment\n- Manufacturing scale-up\n- Launching into the economy\n- Installation of conservation technology\n- Financing infrastructure standup\n- Roadmapping\n\nStep Four: Filling the Gaps with the\nEstablishment and Funding of:\n- 1) ARPA-E: A translational R&D entity\n- 2) A wholly-owned govt corporation for back end\nelements:\n- Sharing the financing of carefully monitored demonstrations of\nlarge engineering projects\n- Encouraging and incentivizing industry consortia to cut costs\nof manufacturing technologies and processes\n- Speed the scale-up of manufacturing production capacity\n- Financing installation of conservation, efficiency and related\nnew technologies in residential and commercial markets\n- 3) A Think-Tank to develop a detailed roadmap for the\nrequirements for the development and launch of particular\nenergy-related innovations, and to recommend policies to\nfacilitate them\n\nWhat Else?\n- Standards - Critical:\n- to smart grid, to managing ebb and flow of renewables,etc.\n- to offsets - what credits for what kinds of offsets, and for\ntransparency, monitoring systems\n- to assumptions about tech performance and life cycle energy savings\n- Test Beds\n- We need to demo performance and optimize new efficiency\ntechnologies for different geographies - proof of practice, cost control\n- Need to test them as an integrated systems\n- DOD is the largest facilities owner in the US, in wide range of\ngeographies; also: huge energy dependent operations\n- DOD already doing demos of efficiency technologies\n- has energy savings contracting power and $20B/yr MilCon approps\n- Could it put up block of facilities with private sector firms bidding for\nefficiency?\n\nProblem of New Functionality\n- IT: new functionality added to the US economy - major new\nfunctions, accompanying productivity gains\n- Energy - more complicated\n- Still have cars, electricity still from wall outlets\n- But: over time: new functionality - LED light walls, distributed\npower - takes time to evolve\n- Throughout: efficiency gains that translate over time into\nproductivity gains in all sectors\n- Productivity gains crucial to innovation waves\n- Consumers will pay a premium for first generation of new\nfunctionality products\n- But first gen of new energy wont offer much new functionality\n- Could R&D focus on driving down price as well as research? -\nARPA-E doing\n\nSummary - Bonvillian & Weiss\n- Need to apply all innovation models:\n- Pipeline; Induced; Extended Pipeline;\nManufacturing-Led; Innovation Organization\n- Need 4 step process\n- Figure out launch categories, group them\n- Apply right incentive packages to each launch\ncategory\n- Evaluate gaps in the innovation system\n- Fill the gaps\n- Must have both frontend and backend\ninitiatives in a complex, established sector45\n\nDorothy Robyn, former Deputy\nUndersecretary of Defense for Facilities\nand Environment - DOD Energy Role\n!

So how do we do it?\n\nBringing emerging technologies into\nLegacy Sectors is not \"Mission\nImpossible\" --\n! Areas where innovation has transformed\nLegacy Sectors:\n\"The \"Revolution in Military Affairs\" in the\nDefense Sector in the 90's\n! Sectors where we now see the potential for\nnew innovation\n- but many challenges\nremain:\n\"Advanced manufacturing\n\"New energy technologies\n\"\"Intelligent\" cars\n\"Online education\n\"Commercial space\n\nTake-home Lessons:\n!Obstacles to disruptive innovation in legacy sectors\nhinder innovations that would address\nenvironmental issues\n!Innovation is not restricted to cutting-edge\n\"shining lights\"\n!The barriers to environmental innovation in\ndisparate Legacy sectors have much in common\nand are found in the U.S. and in foreign economies\n!Encouraging innovation in Legacy sectors requires\nattention to the entire innovation process.\n!This includes both support to R&D and policy and\ninstitutional measures to anticipate and confront\nbarriers to scale-up and market launch.\n!The economic, political, cultural, social, and legal\ncontext of innovation can be as important as the\ninnovation system\n\nEntrenched Legacy Sectors\nResist Disruptive Innovation\nLegacy Sector\nCharacteristics:\n!Provide incentives to\nproducers that do not align\nwith societal objectives\n!Are defended by\ntechnological/ economic/\npolitical/\nsocial/cultural/legal\nparadigms:, and by\nnumerous market\nimperfections\nInnovations in Legacy\nSectors:\n! Face no special obstacles IF\nthey fit the paradigm\n! Face high obstacles if they\ndo NOT fit prevailing\nbusiness models-\n! -- especially if driven by\nexternalities\n! So the obstacles to\ninnovation in these sectors\nare also obstacles to\nenvironmental innovation\n! These obstacles are\ndefended by powerful\nvested interests and share\ncommon features\n! Governments sometimes\n!These enable resistance to inhibit innovation and\nsometimes guide it into\ndisruptive innovation\ndesirable directions.\n\nThe Features of a Legacy Sector:\nLegacy\nCharacteristics:\n!Perverse prices that do not\nreflect externalities\n!Established infrastructure\n!Public expectations\n!Career paths and university\ncurricula favor oil, gas, coal\n!Regulatory requirements\nplace obstacles\n!Limited R&D compared to\nrevenue\n!All defended by powerful\nvested interests\n!Constitute\n\"technological/economic/politi\ncal/social\" paradigm\nMarket Imperfections\nHindering New\nTechnologies &\nRenewables:\n! Perverse subsidies\n! Network Economies\n! Non- Appropriability\n! Lumpiness\n! minimum investment size\n! Need for collective action\n! (for new Infrasturcture,\nresearch)\n! Short time horizon of venture\nfinancing\n! In contrast, Paradigm-\nCompatible innovations (e.g.,\nfracking) expand smoothly\n\nFive Models of Innovation Dynamics\n-- Legacy sectors create barriers to innovation -\nunderstanding them helps us to choose policy\ninstruments to overcome these barriers.\n1. The Pipeline -\n!Technology-Push, Technology-Supply\n!Federally supported research pushes basic\nresearch\n!New technologies develop and push into markets\n!Dominant model underlying US innovation policy\n2. Induced -\n!Technology-Pull, Demand-Pull\n!Industry spots market niche\n!Technology advances (often incremental) are pulled\nto meet demand\n!Innovation can be induced by changes in markets or\npolicy - gov't regulations, incentives, prizes\n\nModels of Innovation Dynamics, Con't\n3. The Extended Pipeline - NEW\n!Technology-Push\n! But Government technology support at every\nstage\n!Defense Department support to R, D,\ndemonstration, testbed, initial market creation\n4. Manufacturing-Led Innovation - NEW\n!Initial production can be highly innovative -\n!Design a product to fit a market, redo the\nscience, highly creative engineering\n!Example - Japan's creation of Quality\nManufacturing\n!An important but underappreciated source\nof innovation\n\nModels of Innovation Dynamics, Con't\n5. Innovation Organization - NEW\n!Encompasses the four other models\n!Goes beyond them to take account of broad\ncontext and structure into which innovation is to\nbe introduced\n!To innovate in legacy sectors, need all four\nmodels,\n!Need change agents to orchestrate the full\ninnovation environment and the actors within it\nto address new technology and broader policy\nand institutional issues\n\" Manufacturing has not been considered a\nsource of innovation;\n\" Three of the Five models involve a major\ngovernment role\n\nSummary of the Five Models\n! Pipeline: Support research; innovation will follow:\nTech-Push.\n! Induced: Change prices (or policies); innovation\nwill follow: Tech-Pull.\n! Extended pipeline: Government supports not\nonly research, but also demonstration, testbed,\nand initial market creation.\n\" Manufacturing-led: Design and initial production\nof a manufacturable, marketable product\nrequire creative engineering.\n\" Innovation organization: Research support,\npolicy and institutional change are needed for\nan innovation context that poses obstacles to\ninnovation scale-up.\n\"Must apply all 4 dynamics for a legacy sector.\n\nImplications of these Models for\nSpurring Innovation in Legacy Sectors:\n!
