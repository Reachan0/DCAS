It is focused on domains in which systems are important, because either or both products are parts of larger and more complex systems, or they are comprised of systems.\n\nThe domains that will be covered include computing, communications (in particular the mobile and IP domains), consumer electronics, industrial networking, automotive, aerospace and medical devices. The course will be of particular interest to those interested in managing a business in which technology will likely play a major role, and also to those interested in investing in or providing counsel to these businesses.\n\nThe emphasis throughout is on the development and application of ways of thinking or mental models that bring clarity to the complex co-evolution of technological innovation, the demand opportunity, systems architecture, business ecosystems, and decision-making and execution within the business.\n\nThis involves the acquisition and application of a set of powerful analytical tools that are critical for the effective development of business strategy for high-tech and systems business, and for technology strategy as a key element within business strategy. These tools provide insights when anticipating and deciding how to respond to the behavior of customers, complementors and competitors, and when deciding which technologies to invest in, opportunities to target or partnerships to pursue. The objective of the program is to improve (significantly) the odds of success when figuring out how to create and capture value, make difficult decisions and develop and deliver technologies, platforms and products.\n\nThe course uses case studies and presentations, and also relies upon independent research by participants. The case studies provide an extensive opportunity to integrate and apply these tools and theories in a practical, business policy context. The readings support the case study and provide a strong theoretical framework to support the practical analysis of real-world cases.\n\nClass Preparation\n\nThis is not an easy course, because this is not an easy subject, and its objective is to provide a complete introduction to and overview of this complex, dynamic and uncertain area.\n\nIt is critical that you both read and review the case studies and the readings before class. You cannot participate effectively without being familiar with the case material, and having taken the time to develop your own insights. The readings are essential to enable you to make sense of the case studies as we develop the body of knowledge both inductively and deductively.\n\nThe grades for class participation will be awarded on the basis of the quality of the contribution, not the quantity. You should not feel compelled to speak up in every class. We will, however, seek to ensure that everyone participates, by calling on you at our discretion if you have not spoken up, so it behooves you to participate when you do think you have something interesting to say. Interesting questions, in a spirit of inquiry, count as much as interesting answers.\n\nAs both a matter of courtesy and to ensure that you derive the full benefit from the class, please observe the following guidelines, all of which will be taken into consideration as criteria in evaluating your class participation grade:\n\nprepare properly\n\narrive on time\n\nturn off your cellphone\n\ndo not use your laptop\n\ndo not leave early\n\nGrading\n\nGrades will be determined by a combination of individual class participation, by four short individual papers, and by a longer final paper and accompanying summary presentation, which must be done in project teams of three to five people.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nClass participation\n\n30%\n\n4 short papers\n\n30%\n\nFinal paper and summary presentation\n\n40%\n\nShort Papers\n\nDuring the first part of the course I will ask you to write four short papers that apply ways of thinking and mental models developed during the previous weeks to a technology domain (a specified sphere or activity or knowledge) of your choice. All of these papers should be about the same domain; you should consult with me or one of the TA's if you find this difficult or impossible. Although you will likely find it helpful to pick your domain and do much of your research early, you will benefit from waiting for the summary lecture on the topic before finalizing your draft, and in each case will have at least a week to submit the paper after this lecture.\n\nCollaboration\n\nGroup work is not just acceptable but very actively encouraged. I strongly recommend that you form a study group with a few friends who can meet to discuss the cases and readings before each class. Our experience suggests that this will significantly increase both your enjoyment of the course and the amount that you find yourself learning.\n\nProject Teams\n\nYou must form teams of between three and five people for the final project no later than Lec #9. This gives you at least eight (8) weeks in which to complete your project work. Each project team will focus on a particular domain and a business within that domain. The fourth class is set aside to give everyone who wishes to an opportunity to pitch a proposal for a domain and a business within that domain as the focus of a project team. This allows three weeks for you to form project teams. You are responsible for forming yourselves into project teams, and this is why we have set aside a session to facilitate this.\n\nFinal Paper and Presentation\n\nThe final paper and presentation must be completed in your project teams. They are both due for submission by 9:00 am on Lec #24.\n\nWhereas the short papers are essentially descriptive, the final paper is prescriptive in nature. It should focus on a specific business within the domain that your group has chosen, and set out what you believe the strategy of that business should be. The analysis should cover technological innovation, the demand opportunity, life cycles and transitions, the relevant system architecture and business ecosystems.\n\nYour recommendations on strategy should cover creating and capturing value, key decisions and delivering value. It should also include the supporting analysis and rationale for your recommendations, applying the ways of thinking and mental models developed in the class.\n\nYou should also prepare a short presentation of up to 9 minutes duration, comprising an absolute maximum of 15 slides that provides a summary of your recommendations and the rationale for them. Each team will present their recommendations in the final two classes, Lec #24-25.",

viable\nstrategic options\n- \"Management teams whose\nmembers challenge one\nanother's thinking develop\na more complete\nunderstanding of the\nchoices, create a richer\nrange of options, and\nultimately make the kinds of\neffective decisions\nnecessary in today's\ncompetitive environments\"\nMichael A M Davies\n\n15.965 Technology & Strategy\nBuilding the team\n- Assemble a heterogeneous team, including diverse ages,\ngenders, specialist expertise and professional experience\n- Meet together as a team often and regularly\n- Encourage team members to assume roles that go\nbeyond their nominal responsibilities of product, market\nor function\n- Apply multiple mindsets to any issue, using tools such\nas scenarios, role-playing and 'war games'\n- Actively manage conflict - but don't make it personal,\nor seek to suppress it\nMichael A M Davies\n\n15.965 Technology & Strategy\nHow can you make good decisions, when\nconflict is likely?\nCommon goals\n- collaborative\nproblem solving\n- inquiry rather\nthan advocacy\nFocus on issues\n- not a slow\nregular (annual)\ncycle\n- not by\norganizational\n(business) unit\nMake it fun!\n- Focus on the facts\n- more, rather than\nless, objective and\ntimely information\n- not just opinions\n- Consider multiple\nalternative options\n(>2\n~4-5)\ntogether\n- Make sure\nstrategic decisions\nconsistent

[# of duplex channels]\nMichael A M Davies\n\n15.965 Technology & Strategy\nStaged Deployment\n- The traditional approach doesn't reduce risks because it\ncannot adapt to uncertainty\n- A flexible approach can be used: the system should\nhave the ability to adapt to the uncertain demand\n- This can be achieved with a staged deployment strategy:\n-A smaller, more affordable system is initially built\n-This system has the flexibility to increase its\ncapacity if demand is sufficient and if the decision\nmakers can afford additional capacity\nMichael A M Davies\n\n15.965 Technology & Strategy\nStaged deployment strategy reduces the\neconomic risks via two mechanisms\n- The costs of the system are spread through time:\n-Money has a time value: to spend a dollar tomorrow\nis better than spending one now (Present Value)\n-Delaying expenditures always appears as an\nadvantage\n- The decision to deploy is done observing the market\nconditions:\n-Demand may never grow and we may want to keep\nthe system as it is without deploying further.\n-If demand is important enough, we may have made\nsufficient profits to invest in the next stage.\nMichael A M Davies\n\n15.965 Technology & Strategy\nFocus shifts from picking a \"best guess\" optimal\narchitecture to choosing a valuable, flexible path\n- Decide what kind of service should be offered\n- Conduct a market survey for this type of service\n- Conduct a baseline architecture trade study\n- Identify Interesting paths for Staged Deployment\n- Select an Initial Stage Architecture (based on Real\nOptions Analysis)\n- Obtain FCC approval for the system\n- Implement and Launch the system\n- Operate and observe actual demand\nt\n- Make periodic reconfiguration decisions\n- Retire once Design Life has expired\nMichael A M Davies\n\n15.965 Technology & Strategy\nFirst, figure out what the nature of the 'real\noptions' are - partition the design vector\nThen, explore the possible paths in the 'trade\nspace' - the sequences of options\nThen, calculate the costs\n\n15.965 Technology & Strategy\nUsing real options for LEO satellites\nIdentify Flexibility\nGenerate \"Paths\"\nModel Demand\nx

large\nengineering systems can be shown by designing for\nstaged deployment, rather then for worst case, fixed\ncapacity.\n- Embedding such flexibility does not come for free and\nevolution paths of system designs do not generally\ncoincide with the Pareto frontier.\nMichael A M Davies\n\n15.965 Technology & Strategy\nWhat you do about real options, and when you\ndo it, depends on value to cost,
