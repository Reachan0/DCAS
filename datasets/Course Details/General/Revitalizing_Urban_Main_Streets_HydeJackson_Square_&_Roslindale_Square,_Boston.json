The course content covers three broad areas:\n\nan overview of the causes for urban business district decline, the challenges faced in revitalization, and the type of revitalization strategies employed;\n\nthe physical and economic development planning tools used to understand and assess urban Main Streets from physical design and economic development perspectives; and\n\nthe policies, interventions, and investments used to foster urban commercial revitalization.\n\nThe course has dual goals: to explore the integration of economic and physical development interventions in ways that reinforce commercial district revitalization efforts and to apply this knowledge through the development of a formal neighborhood commercial revitalization plan for a client business district.\n\nOverview of the Client and Project Focus\n\nThe spring 2005 class will work with the City of Boston's Main Streets Program and Main Streets Partnerships to formulate plans for two Boston neighborhood Main Streets: Hyde/Jackson Square and Roslindale Village (pending sufficient enrollment to undertake two projects). The Hyde/Jackson Square district is the northern Centre Street corridor in Jamaica Plain. Roslindale Village is located approximately one mile south of the Forest Hills T-Station. The district extends along Washington Street and Belgrade Avenue and includes surrounding streets.\n\nThe Boston Main Streets Program designates neighborhood Main Streets districts and provides funding and technical assistance to help these districts create healthy and sustainable commercial areas. Each designated neighborhood district has established a separate 501(c)(3) corporation to implement its Main Streets program and has funding for one full time staff person. Main Streets districts work under a framework developed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Main Street Center that organizes work into four interrelated activities, each overseen by a volunteer committee:\n\nDesign: addressing the district's physical design needs, such as facade improvement;\n\nPromotion: marketing the district to attract more customers;\n\nEconomic Restructuring: identifying and attracting new and viable economic uses; and\n\nOrganization: addressing organizational issues such as governance, fund-raising, and volunteer recruitment within the district.\n\nClass Project\n\nThe class project will consist of a three-stage process:\n\nbaseline/existing conditions analysis leading to a proposed improvement agenda confirmed with the client;\n\ndetailed research, analysis and design related to the agenda; and\n\nformulation of plan elements, review with client and preparation of final plan.\n\nEach neighborhood Main Street district will serve as a separate client for a team of six to ten students. Each district team may divide its planning work into smaller sub-teams of three to four students. Throughout the semester, these teams will present their work for discussion and commentary by the entire class with client input. The Main Street district's role as client will include:\n\nFacilitating student research by providing background material, serving as liaison to community members and organizations, and integrating student work into their planning process\n\nProviding guidance on the district's goals and priorities\n\nAssisting student efforts with district volunteers if necessary\n\nProviding feedback on the proposed agenda and draft plan elements\n\nThe three stages of the class project are the following:\n\nBaseline Analysis to Document Existing Conditions and Identify Priority Areas for Detailed Planning\n\nIn this first phase, student teams in both districts will collect and analyze data to better understand existing physical and economic conditions in the business district, local visions and goals for the district among stakeholders, existing activities and plans, and key future opportunities. This work will include: (a) reviewing existing data, regulations and studies; (b) surveying and mapping existing environmental and physical conditions; (c) conducting an inventory of existing properties and businesses; and (d) conducting demographic and economic analysis to create profiles of the district's market and key business sectors.\n\nBased on the findings from this preliminary analysis, student teams will recommend an improvement agenda with priority opportunities and issues to address in their revitalization plans. After reviewing these findings and recommendations with the client and agreeing on the planning agenda, student teams will conduct more detailed research, analysis and design work to help formulate proposals around the selected agenda.\n\nDetailed Research, Analysis and Planning in Priority Areas\n\nIn this second phase, student teams will undertake more in-depth research, analysis and design in priority areas to better understand the requirements needed to realize goals and opportunities, assess existing resources and assets, identify critical obstacles and resources gaps to address, and define other factors that shape effective strategies and interventions to generate the Main Street district's desired revitalization goals.\n\nWhile specific research tasks will depend on the priority issues chosen, tasks may include conducting interviews with key stakeholders, surveying district customers and businesses, researching applicable zoning and regulatory obstacles, investigating design options, identifying best practices used in comparable neighborhoods/districts, and analyzing potential resources for implementation. Based on this detailed research, each student team will develop findings and recommendations for their final plan.\n\nFormulation of Recommendations and Preparation of the Final Plan\n\nIn the final phase, each student team will review the results of its analysis and research, develop initial proposals for key elements of the plan and integrate these recommendations into a draft overall business district revitalization plan. After a review of this draft plan with the entire class and the client, each team will revise its plan for a final public presentation and written report. Students will present the final plan to the client and an invited audience sometime during the final two weeks of class. The final report will be due one week after the last day of class.\n\nClass Requirements\n\nThis class is a workshop. The class will meet twice weekly. Monday classes are 1-1/2 hours in length and are devoted to lectures and some discussion. Wednesday classes are 2-1/2 hours and are reserved mostly for in-class work time and site visits. This schedule does not apply to the first two weeks of class, which will be mostly lecture with some discussion.\n\nClass requirements include extensive reading, ongoing assignments related to development of the plans, active class participation, field trips and site visits to the team project area and active involvement and contribution to the team project.\n\nGrading\n\nactivities\n\npercentAGES\n\nActive Participation and Contribution to Class Discussions\n\n15%\n\nAttendance\n\n10%\n\nFirst Short Assignment\n\n10%\n\nGroup Project (Develop an urban design/economic development plan for a Main Streets District in Boston)\n\n65%\n\nTeam members will be asked to evaluate and grade each member of the group (including themselves) based on individuals' active participation in the project and contribution to the team. These evaluations will be considered during the grading process.",

The second step is to identify specific\nand unified efforts for business support and\nplaces. The community is filled with unique\nphysical assets - landmarks, interesting\nviews, and numerous gathering places along\na pedestrian-scale street grid. Roslindale's\npopulation is stable, vibrant, and diverse -\nfamilies are continuing to make their homes\nin Roslindale and neighborhood incomes\nare rising. New businesses are joining de-\ncades-old shops in providing a wide variety\nof goods and services. In short, Roslindale\nis not just a commercial center, but a true\nvillage.\nRoslindale Village Main Streets has achieved\nremarkable success over the past 20 years\nin reversing a trend of decline.\nToday,\nRoslindale faces a new set of challenges:\nhow does the village continue its strong\ngrowth while retaining its unique character?\nIn what ways can the Main Streets\norganization strengthen its role in helping\nthe village achieve its full potential?\nAnswering these questions requires a three-\nstep process:\n1. The first step is to define a vision that\nbest captures the spirit of Roslindale - a\nvision that is based on its unique village\ncharacter\ngoals and strategies to advance the vision\nin both the short and long term\n3. The third step is to establish an\norganizational\nframework\nfor\nMain\nStreets to develop the tools to achieve\nthese goals\nThis document begins with an assessment\nof existing conditions.\nWhat makes a\nRoslindale a village?\nWhich aspects of\nthe village are currently successful? Which\naspects need improvement?\nThe first\nchapter finds that Roslindale has strong\nphysical assets, such as Adams Park, but\nalso certain liabilities, such as congested\ntraffic.\nRoslindale has a number of\nstrengths to build upon and shortcomings\nto be addressed - there is room to grow as\na village.\nThe second chapter outlines the goals\nand strategies that will help maintain\nRoslindale's unique village character as the\ndistrict continues to develop. These goals\nand strategies span the gamut of physical,\neconomic, and organizational interventions:\nimprovements to Adams Park and the\ndistrict's gateways; changes to traffic\ncirculation and parking strategies; upgrades\nto streetscape and pedestrian circulation;\ndistrict marketing. Each of these elements\nhas short and long term components\nthat can be implemented incrementally as\nopportunities arise.\nThe third chapter discusses the steps\nrequired to implement the elements of the\nplan. More broadly, this chapter describes\nways in which Main Streets can reposition\nitself for the challenges that lie ahead. The\nsuccesses of the past twenty years have\nprovided a firm foundation from which to\ngrow the organization, cultivate new and\nexisting relationships, and increase capacity\nand skills.\nMain Streets faces specific\nchallenges - but also opportunitie\ntunities - in re\nfocusing its strategies for governance,\ncommunity support, fiscal strength and\nsustainability, communications, and strategic\npartnerships.\nRoslindale Village has been one of Boston's\nmost successful Main Streets districts. By\ndeveloping a community vision, a set of\ngoals and strategies, and an implementation\nframework, Main Streets can help Roslindale\ngrow\neven\nmore\nprosperous\nwhile\nmaintaining its unique character - ensuring\nthat the village's best days are yet to come.\nExecutive Summary\n\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nChapter 1 - Existing Conditions\n\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nRoslindale is located six miles southwest of\ndowntown Boston. Covering approximately\nthree square miles, Roslindale borders\nJamaica Plain, West Roxbury, Hyde Park, and\nMattapan. The population of Roslindale\nbegan to grow substantially in the late\n19th century with the installation of trolley\nlines from downtown Boston to Dedham,\nwhich greatly facilitated commuter trips\nto and from the district. By the mid-20th\ncentury, Roslindale was one of the strongest\ncommercial areas in southwest Boston. Yet\nas with many urban neighborhoods across\nthe country, the district lost many of its\ncustomers to new, suburban malls during\nthe 1960's.\nMany local businesses were\nforced to close as shoppers and competing\nbusinesses moved to shopping centers such\nas the Dedham Mall. As a result, the district\nsaw great deterioration in the 1970's and\n1980's, with high rates of abandonment and\narson.\nIn 1983, Roslindale Village, as part of the\nUrban Demonstration Project, became the\nfirst urban application of the National Trust\nfor Historic Preservation's Main Street\nmodel. The Roslindale Village Main Street\n(RVMS) organization has been working to\nfacades, supporting local businesses, and\nimprove the business district in Roslindale\norganizing many social community events.\nRoslindale Village and\nSquare for over twenty years by refurbishing\nsurrounding neighborhoods\ndozens of\ncommercial buildings and\nAbout Roslindale Village\n\nOne of the most important tasks facing\nRVMS is adjusting to the changing\ndemographics\nof\nRoslindale.\nThe\npopulation of Roslindale grew slightly\nbetween 1990 and 2000, and growth is\nexpected to remain stable in the next decade.\nAccording to projections published with\n! \"!\nthe 2000 US Census, 26,937 people lived\nin Roslindale in 2003, and it is anticipated\nthat the total population will increase only\nto 27,200 by 2008.\nThe diversity of the Roslindale community\nis one of the core strengths of this district\n!\nand is central in shaping the village identity.\n\nIn recent years, Roslindale has seen\n\nincreasing racial diversity, and according\n\nto projections, racial diversity in Roslindale\n!\nis expected to increase. As the proportion\nof black, Hispanic, and other minorities\nincrease, the white population is expected\nto decrease in size. The percentage of\nresidents born outside of the United\nStates has also grown from 1990 to 2000,\n\nsuggesting increasing diversity and a greater\ninternational presence in the district. There\nare several cultural groups that add to\nRoslindale's ethnic richness that are not\nrepresented in these Census figures. For\nexample, the Greek community holds a\nvisible presence in the neighborhood, as\nevidenced by the Vouros Pastry Shop, the\nRoslindale Fish Market, and Alexander the\nGreat Park.\nAverage household income in Roslindale in\n2003 was approximately $59,000, which is\nWho lives in Roslindale?\n\nhigher than the city average.\nHousehold\nHousehold Structure\nincome grew during the 1990's, and the total\n7 or More\nincome of Roslindale families is projected\n1 Person\n2 Persons 3 Persons 4 Persons 5 Persons 6 Persons\nPersons\nto increase by 17% to $64,363 by 2008.\n25%\n31%\n18%\n14%\n8%\n3%\n1%\nThe 2000 US Census is the latest\ncomprehensive\ncount\nof\nRoslindale\nresidents and may not reflect more recent\ndemographic shifts in the area.\nThe\nCensus Bureau and several repackaged data\nproducts offer projections based on trends\nfrom earlier censuses. These projections\nprovide a conservative estimate of trends,\nwhich may understate some of the recent\nchanges observed by area residents. For\ninstance, interviews and observation in\nthe district point to an influx of young,\nwealthy families that does not match\nthese demographic projections.\nThe\nanalysis in this report is based on Census\nBureau 2003 and 2008 estimates obtained\nfrom GeoLytics. \"Roslindale\" is defined\nhere as the 22 Census block groups that\nare contained entirely within the 02131\nRoslindale zip code.\n26%\n30%\n17%\n15%\n8%\n3%\n2%\n2003 (proj.)\n26%\n30%\n16%\n14%\n8%\n3%\n2%\n2008 (proj.)\n27%\n30%\n16%\n14%\n8%\n3%\n2%\nDemographic Profile\nYear\nTotal Population\nTotal Household\nIncome\nIncome per\nHousehold\nPercent Foreign Born\n25,808\n288,122,500\n$\n$\n39,241\n18%\n26,969\n542,828,095\n$\n$\n54,517\n26%\n2003 (proj.)\n26,937\n569,735,705\n$\n$\n54,851\nN/A\n2008 (proj.)\n27,203\n679,540,566\n$\n$\n64,363\nN/A\nSource: U.S. Census 1990 and 2000\nHousehold Composition\nUnder 18\n18-65\nOver 65\n22%\n62%\n16%\n25%\n62%\n13%\n2003 (proj.)\n25%\n63%\n13%\n2008 (proj.)\n24%\n63%\n13%\nChapter 1 - Existing Conditions - Demographics\n\nRight: Notable facade of Sacred\nHeart Catholic Church.\nLeft: Clock tower at corner of\nSouth & Birch Streets.\nSense of place is a key element for both\nvisitors and residents. Roslindale Village is\nfortunate to have a wide variety of physical\nattributes, including landmarks, open spaces,\nand views that visitors and residents use to\nidentify the fact that they are within the Vil\nlage. Highlighting these physical landmarks\nstrengthens Roslindale's identity as a unique\nplace and will provide a starting point for\neven greater physical definition of Roslin\ndale Village. A positive image of Roslindale\ncan encourage visitors to return and en\nhance the quality of life for residents.\nLandmarks\nLandmarks within Roslindale Village exist\nboth at the large scale, such as church\nsteeples that can be seen from across the\ndistrict, and the small scale, including\nsculptures and murals that are seen only\nfrom an immediately adjacent area. Both\nscales are equally important. When large-\nscale monuments come into view, a sense of\narrival is created, and throughout a visit to\nthe district, these monuments give physical\nreference to the boundaries of the Village.\nPhysical Assessment\nSmaller landmarks distinguish the Village\nas a one-of-a-kind place, in sharp contrast\nto common commercial landmarks (such\nas McDonalds' golden arches) that can be\nfound anywhere throughout the city. These\nsmaller landmarks also create pedestrian-\nscaled reference points within the Village,\nallowing, for example, a group of friends to\nmeet up \"by the clock on the corner.\"\nLarge-scale landmarks in Roslindale Village\ninclude the three church steeples that bracket\nthe eastern and western boundaries of the\ncommercial district and two major buildings,\nthe public library, with its rounded blue roof\nand the MBTA substation on Washington\nStreet. Also at this scale are the two most\nprominent open spaces, Adams Park and\nAlexander the Great Park, which can be\nseen from many vantage points within the\nVillage. On a smaller scale, murals found\nthroughout the district enhance the sense of\nplace. At the smallest scale, visible mainly\nto the pedestrian or observant driver or\npassenger, are two memorials in Adams\nPark and the clock near the train station.\n\nWashington Street\nCummins Highway\nCorinth Street\nA\nC\nB\nD\nE\nC\nD\nE\nB\nA\nA.\nA small landmark, the clock\ntower at South and Birch\nStreets.\nC.\nPerimeter of Adams Park\nalong South Street\nB.\nThe Roslindale Branch Public\nLibrary completes a vista\ndown Corinth Street\nD.\nView of a mural on the\nhistoric MBTA substation\nE.\nThe prominent steeple of\nSacred Heart Catholic Church\nChapter 1 - Existing Conditions - Physical Assessment: Demographics\n\nRight: A pedestrian crosswalk leading\ninto Adams Park\nPlace-making\nA wide range of landmarks combines\nwith Roslindale Village's irregular street\ngrid to create a series of street views that\ncontinually reveal the unique elements of\nthe Village. For example, as one walks or\ndrives down Corinth Street, Alexander the\nGreat Park marks the entry into the Village,\ntwo murals further define the Village, and\nthe blue roof of the Library helps people\norient themselves in the Village. While\nthis series of unique views invites the\npedestrian to explore Roslindale Village, a\nseries of public spaces provide an important\nopportunity to linger. While Adams Park is\nthe most visible of these spaces, smaller\npublic spaces also provide hidden jewels for\nthe visitor to discover and allow for a more\nintimate experience of the neighborhood.\nThese unique street views and public\nspaces provide a backbone of positive\nphysical attributes that can be expanded to\nstrengthen Roslindale's distinct character\nLeft: Corner of a triangular building\nthat houses Emack & Bolio's\nand unique identity.\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nNodes\nRoslindale's diversity can be seen through the\nvariety of goods, services, and community\norganizations that are clustered throughout\nthe district.\nThe analysis map of the\nphysical uses show how the village serves\nthe needs of a variety of groups, including\nresidents, visitors, commuters, children,\nand the elderly. The map shows where use\nis concentrated or where overlaps in use\ntake place. An analysis of usage patterns\nidentifies Washington Street as a possible\nbarrier for some groups and highlights how\nthis major arterial road divides the district\nin two.\nThe Roslindale Community\nCenter and the post office at the\nintersection of Cummins Highway\nand Washington Street\nChapter 1 - Existing Conditions - Physical Assessment: Nodes\n\nAbove: Perimeter of Adams Park\nalong Poplar Street in winter.\nMiddle: Pedestrian pathway in\nAdams Park.\nBelow: Entry into Adams Park\nfrom Washington Street.\nAdams Park\nAs the physical center of Roslindale Village,\nthis small, triangular park anchors one of\nthe few true squares in Boston. Adams Park\nshapes the Roslindale business district in a\nnon-linear fashion that is distinct from other\nMain Street districts in Boston. Adams Park\nis a site for much-loved community events,\nsuch as the annual Easter Egg Hunt and the\nChristmas Tree lighting. For commuters,\nAdams Park is a strong marker along\nWashington Street that indicates arrival into\nRoslindale.\nIn spite of the park's prominent role in\nshaping the character of the district, Adams\nPark does not presently function as the\ncenter of Roslindale Village. Following the\nrevitalization of the northwest corner of\nRoslindale Village, the psychological center\nof the Square has shifted. Some residents\nhave gone as far as to define the borders of\nRoslindale Square as Birch, Corinth, Poplar,\nand South Streets, relegating Adams Park\nto a second tier feature within Roslindale\nVillage. Furthermore, because of the traffic\ncirculation patterns and rapid vehicular\nflow around Adams Park, pedestrians\nmust contend with cars, buses, and delivery\ntrucks, making visiting the park difficult and\noften dangerous.\nAdams Park falls under the jurisdiction\nof the Boston Parks Department and is\nmaintained through a grant from Bank of\nAmerica. This grant allows Roslindale to\npay for landscape maintenance but not to\nintroduce large-scale park improvements.\nThe landscape design for the park does not\nallow the space to meet its full potential as\nan event place and location for informal\nrecreation. Although there are over twenty\nbusinesses that are directly across the\nstreet, Adams Park remains disconnected\nfrom all of its surrounding uses. Adjacent\nbusinesses are seemingly disconnected from\nthe park and do not take advantage of its\nclose proximity.\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nin the\nthe\nconcentrated\none of\nStreet in\n-\n-\n:\nof\nVacancies\ncore of Roslindale Village that disrupt the\ndistrict's character but also present great\nopportunity for development.

Three major roads\ncross the district: Washington Street\neet, which\nborders Adams Park, Belgrade Avenue, which\nconnects to Jamaica Plain, and Cummins\nHighway, which connects to Mattapan.\nCummins Highway carries 18,000 cars a\nday and feeds directly into Washington\nStreet at Adam's Park.\nAccording to\nthe Boston Transportation Department,\napproximately 50% of Roslindale residents\ndrove to work in 1990 and 80% owned\ncars. Today, 64% of trips in Roslindale are\nmade by car, 38% are made by foot or bike,\nand only 6% by public transit. The village\nis highly accessible by multiple modes of\ntransportation; seventeen bus lines travel\nthrough Roslindale Village.\nAbove: Cars turning from\nCummins Highway onto\nWashington Street.\nTraffic circulation around Adams Park\nnegatively impacts the village feel and\npedestrian experience.\nBuses that stop\nalong\nWashington\nStreet\nsignificantly\ncongest the traffic flow within Roslindale\nSquare. A circulation pattern that uses the\nroadway perimeter around Adams Park as a\nrotary exacerbates the district's congestion\nproblems.\nThe otherwise picturesque\npark and its surrounding businesses lose\ntheir pedestrian appeal because of the\ndanger associated with the traffic that\nruns counterclockwise around the park.\nFurthermore,\npedestrian\ndeaths\nhave\noccurred on South Street.\nBelow: A pedestrian crossing\nsign on Birch Street.\nChapter 1 - Existing Conditions - Physical Assessment: Traffic\n\nCommuter Rail\nDestination or\npassing through:\nDedham Mall\nDestination or\npassing through:\nForest Hills\nOrange Line\nCommuter Line\nBus routes:\n34E\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nPedestrians crossing Washington\nStreet\nPeople awaiting the bus at the\ncorner of Poplar and Corinth\nStreets.\nChapter 1 - Existing Conditions - Physical Assessment: Traffic\n\nA view of the MBTA Commuter\nRail parking lot, facing Belgrade\nAvenue.\nCurbside parking along\nWashington Street, facing south.\npublic. The MBTA commuter rail lot is\nthe largest and offers 139 parking spots\nfor two dollars a day. The second largest\nis the public parking lot behind the Citizens\nBank, which offers free daily parking.\nUnfortunately, surface parking in Roslindale\nis underutilized.\nIn a recent survey of 96 users of Roslindale\nVillage, individuals were asked to rate 18\ndifferent amenities provided by the Village\nA sign on South Street indicating\na nearby parking lot.\non a scale of 1-low to 5-high. The amount\nof parking in the Village received the second\nlowest score out of all of the amenities that\nare provided by Roslindale Village. While\nthe individuals surveyed believed that the\namount of parking available was a major\nissue for the district, over 80% of the\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\nare\nthat are split\nare\nwho claimed to\nproblems\nmore\nParking\nThere\nalmost 800 parking spots in\nRoslindale Village\nevenly\nbetween on-street and surface lot parking.\nAlthough the parking lots are rarely full,\nRoslindale residents and visitors perceive\na lack of parking to be one of the most\npressing issues facing the district. There are\n425 surface parking spots within Roslindale\nVillage, 70% of which\nopen to the\nindividuals who had driven to the district\nhad no problems finding parking. Of the\ndrivers\nhave\nfinding parking, 71% were not Roslindale\nresidents. The survey analysis, combined\nwith the observed under-usage of surface\nparking in Roslindale, indicates that the\nparking problem in Roslindale has\nto do with perception than with any actual\nshortage.\nRather than park in lots, drivers in Roslindale\nVillage choose to park on the street as close\nto their destination as possible. Due to the\nhigh demand for on-street parking, this\noften means that drivers circle the village\nlooking for parking (while adding to traffic\nand pollution), only to park further from\ntheir destination than the nearest available\nlot.\nThe on-street parking problem is\nexacerbated by day-long users, such as\nemployees and commuters, who park on\nthe street. Additionally, many drivers in\nRoslindale Village are unaware of public\nparking locations or are uncomfortable\nleaving their cars in the lots.\n\n)\nZoning\nUnderstanding the zoning and regulatory\ncontext for Roslindale Village is crucial\nto assessing development opportunities\nand challenges, such as the opportunities\nand constraints of redeveloping vacant or\nabandoned parcels. Currently, the bulk of\nRoslindale Village's vacant parcels fall into\nB-1 and B-2 \"general business zoning\"\ndistricts, where an array of allowable uses\nruns the gamut from residential to retail.\nThis kind of mixed-use zoning is an essential\ningredient for building a successful urban\nretail district as the mix of uses increases\nfoot traffic and a \"captive audience\" for\nsignage and other marketing techniques.\nCurrently, the Boston Redevelopment\nAuthority is pursuing the implementation of\nan interim planning overlay district (IPOD)\nfor the Roslindale neighborhood. The\nBoston Redevelopment Authority defines\nan Interim Planning Overlay District as\n\"a district or group of districts or a\nsubdistrict or group of subdistricts or parts\nthereof (hereafter referred to as an area)\nmay be established as an interim planning\noverlay district when it is determined by the\nZoning Commission that: (1) the existing\nzoning is thought to be inappropriate; (2)\na rezoning of the area is anticipated; (3) a\ncomprehensive planning study preceding\nthe anticipated rezoning is needed; and (4)\ninterim land use regulations are essential\nto maintain the status quo in the area and\nprevent introduction of changes to the area\nwhich may be incompatible with the goals\nof the comprehensive planning study or\nanticipated rezoning\" (Roslindale Interim\nPlanning Overlay District, BRA\nPlanning Overlay District, BRA).\nThe IPOD is meant to serve as a first step\nto developing a neighborhood-specific\nzoning code for Roslindale. Roslindale's\ncurrent situation is anomalous; almost all\nother established neighborhoods in the\nCity of Boston have neighborhood specific\nzoning regulations.\nThe latest draft of the proposed IPOD\nregulations for Roslindale support retail\nuses through design. Specifically, the\npolicies put forth by the IPOD mandate the\ncontinuity of the street wall, the removal\nof storefront grates, and preservation of\nexisting neighborhood character. Each of\nthese mandates is consistent with traditional\nurban design policies for sustaining urban\nretail. Additionally, no drastic changes to the\nzoning or physical character of Roslindale\nare prescribed by the most recent draft\noverlay district.\nA view of Corinth Street from the\nWashington Street intersection\nChapter 1 - Existing Conditions - Physical Assessment: Zoning"

As RVMS continues to recruit new\nbusinesses into Roslindale Village, the com\nmercial potential of the business district\nmust be fully understood.\nRight: A view of Roslindale House\nof Pizza, on Washington Street\nLeft: A view of Boschetto's on\nWashington Street, one of the\nmany bakeries in Roslindale\nEconomic Assessment\n\nBusiness Mix\nThe Roslindale Village business district has\na wide variety of businesses in a relatively\ncompact area. Retail, food services, and\nother services, such as hair and nail salons,\nare by far the dominant sectors in the\ndistrict, comprising over 70% of total\nbusinesses. Finance, insurance, and real\nestate also maintain a significant presence\nin the district, as do civic, health, and\ngovernmental uses.\nRoslindale Village is bifurcated economically\nin the same way it is physically. The western\npart of the district, including Corinth,\nBelgrade, and Birch Streets, has significant\npedestrian foot traffic and well-patronized\nbusinesses. This section contains most of\nthe district's full service restaurants, boutique\ngifts and accessories, and other comparison\nretail, as well as several hair and nail salons,\nbakeries, and Roslindale's primary anchor\ntenant - the Village Market. This section\nalso has a thrift store, a discount department\nstore, a non-profit literacy organization, and\nthree civic clubs.\nTo the northeast of Adams Park along\nWashington Street minimal foot traffic and\na substantially different economic character\ncharacterize the district.

Auto body shops, dry cleaners,\ncarryout restaurants, a Dunkin Donuts,\nand an auto parts store are located in this\nsegment of the street. The southwestern\npart of Washington Street is similar to\nits northeastern counterpart, although\nit maintains a higher proportion of\ncomparison type businesses.\nClusters\nRoslindale Village is fortunate to have\nseveral identifiable clusters of businesses\nwithin the retail and food service sectors.\nThese clusters contribute to the vitality of\nthe district by drawing in customers who\nwish to comparison shop for certain types\nof goods.\nFull-service restaurants are\nemerging as a growing cluster in Roslindale,\nwith seven businesses now in operation and\nmore anticipated. Bakeries form the longest-\nstanding cluster in Roslindale Village, with\nsix establishments that specialize in different\ntypes of baked goods.\nGrocery stores,\nincluding ethnic markets, a supermarket,\nand a wine shop are also a significant\nfood-related component of Roslindale\nVillage. Limited service restaurants are yet\nanother prominent grouping for patrons\nlooking for a fast, inexpensive meal. Taken\ntogether, these clusters represent a sizeable\nagglomeration of food-related businesses\nthat has the potential to draw substantial\nServices\nComparison goods\nConvenience goods\nVacant buildings\nCommercial goods\nChapter 1 - Existing Conditions - Economic Assessment: Business Mix\n\nnumbers of customers who desire a culinary\nexperience.\nThe district also contains non food-related\nclusters.\nA grouping of boutique gifts,\naccessories, and women's apparel has\nformed along Birch Street in the Western\npart of the district draws customers from\noutside Roslindale.\nA cluster of three\nbookstores also exists, although it does not\nappear to be a real draw.\nLeakage Assessment\nA leakage analysis was completed to assess\nthe purchasing power of the district and\ncompare total potential spending of the\nresidents to the existing capacity of retail\nservice. The percentage of leakage reflects\nthe proportion of local purchasing dollars\nspent in competing retail districts that\nwould otherwise be spent in Roslindale\nVillage, and it is an important tool to use in\ndetermining which businesses to recruit to\nthe Village.\nThe total purchasing power of Roslindale\nreflects the amount of\nmoney the\nneighborhood's households spends annually\non a variety of goods and services. The\nincome distribution in Roslindale was\ncompared to the estimated spending\npatterns for households of various income\nlevels in the Northeast, which is calculated\nannually by the Federal Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, to yield an estimate of total\nspending for the area.\nBased on these\ncalculations, Roslindale's 27,000 residents\nspend a total of $438 million annually.\nThe sales capacity is an estimate of the total\nannual revenue of all of the businesses\nin Roslindale Village.\nProjected annual\nrevenue is calculated using the Urban Land\nInstitute's estimates for annual revenue per\nsquare foot of a broad variety of retail\ntypes. Based on the total square footages\nof the businesses in Roslindale Village, the\nsales capacity for the district is $37 million\nannually. The spending power of Roslindale\nis more than ten times greater than the total\nrevenue-generation of Roslindale Village.\nTable 1 details the capture rates for the\nlargest categories of goods and services in\nRoslindale Village. Capture rates are not\nmeasured on a 100-point scale. Different\ngoods and services have varying capacities\nto capture the spending dollars within a\ndistrict. For example, household supplies\nand other convenience goods that people\ntend to buy close-to-home should have a\ncapture rate of roughly 60%. Comparison\ngoods, such as apparel, will have lower\ncapture rates because such goods are more\nhighly differentiated and people will travel\nfarther distances to buy a particular item.\nNonetheless, the leakage analysis detailed\nbelow suggests that the consumer needs\nof Roslindale are not being met by the\nbusinesses currently in the district. The\nstudy further indicates that a variety of\nnew business types could successfully be\nintroduced into Roslindale Village.\nTable 2 lists the business types with the\nhighest capture rates in Roslindale Village.\nThe businesses that sell the goods with the\nhighest capture rates, including personal\ncare products and drugs, have saturated the\nRoslindale Village market, which indicates\nthat there is no great need for additional\nbarbershops or salons.\nTable 3 also provides a more granular\nunderstanding of food sales within the\nvillage by distinguishing between capture\nrates of food eaten at home (purchased at\ngrocery stores) and food eaten outside of\nthe home (purchased at restaurants). The\nlow capture rate (32%) for the grocery stores\nin Roslindale Village is likely attributed to\nthe proximity and competitive pricing of\nRoche Brothers and Shaw's Market, both\nin West Roxbury. More surprising however,\nis that the restaurants in Roslindale Village\nonly capture 15% of the total amount of\nmoney Roslindale residents spend annually\non food outside of the home. The low\ncapture rate of restaurants indicates that\nRoslindale Village can sustain several more\nrestaurants and that RVMS should continue\nits efforts to recruit more restaurants to the\ndistrict.\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nTable 1\nLeakage Rates (%)\nRetail Type\nNumber of\nEstablishments\nEstimated Total\nSpending ($)\nEstimated Total Sales ($)\nLeakage ($)\nCapture Rate (%)\nTransportation\n80,708,000\n$\n1,926,000\n$\n78,783,000\n$\n2.4%\nFood\n64,991,000\n$\n17,977,000\n$\n47,014,000\n$\n27.7%\nEntertainment\n25,174,000\n$\n1,719,000\n$\n23,455,000\n$\n6.8%\nApparel and services\n22,241,000\n$\n2,005,000\n$\n20,236,000\n$\n9.0%\nGifts of goods and services\n14,088,000\n$\n1,374,000\n$\n12,714,000\n$\n9.8%\nAlcoholic beverages\n5,589,000\n$\n3,277,000\n$\n2,312,000\n$\n58.6%\nPersonal care products and services\n6,023,000\n$\n5,916,000\n$\n107,000\n$\n98.2%\nSources: Urban Land Institute, Bureau of Labor Statistics\nTable 2\nHighest Capture Rates (%)\nRetail Type\nNumber of\nEstablishments\nEstimated Total\nSpending ($)\nEstimated Total Sales ($)\nLeakage ($)\nCapture Rate (%)\nPersonal care products and services\n6,023,000\n$\n5,916,000\n$\n107,000\n$\n98.2%\nAlcoholic beverages\n189,000\n$\n255,000\n$\n$\n(65,000)\n134.5%\nSources: Urban Land Institute, Bureau of Labor Statistics\nTable 3\nLowest Capture Rates (%)\nRetail Type\nNumber of\nEstablishments\nEstimated Total\nSpending ($)\nEstimated Total Sales ($)\nLeakage ($)\nCapture Rate (%)\nFood at home\n36,512,000\n$\n12,178,000\n$\n24,335,000\n$\n33.4%\nFood away from home\n28,479,000\n$\n5,799,000\n$\n22,679,000\n$\n20.4%\nApparel and services\n22,241,000\n$\n2,005,000\n$\n20,236,000\n$\n9.0%\nVehicle expenses other than purchases\n27,013,000\n$\n1,484,000\n$\n25,528,000\n$\n5.5%\nVehicle purchases (net outlay)\n34,595,000\n$\n441,000\n$\n34,154,000\n$\n1.3%\nSources: Urban Land Institute, Bureau of Labor Statistics\nChapter 1 - Existing Conditions - Economic Assessment: Leakages\n\nArea Comparison\nAlthough somewhat smaller, Roslindale\nVillage\ncompares\nfavorably\nwith\nneighboring business districts in West\nRoxbury and Jamaica Plain. The Centre-\nSouth and West Roxbury districts are\ncharacterized by large personal service,\nfinance, insurance, real estate, health\ncare, and food service sectors - areas\nin which Roslindale Village is also\nstrong.\nIn addition, as a percentage\nof total businesses, Roslindale has a\nsubstantially higher amount of retail\nfood establishments (9%) than either\nof the other two districts (3% and 4%,\nrespectively). It should also be noted that,\ndespite lacking a significant clothing and\naccessories cluster, Roslindale does not\nappear to be losing clothing shoppers to\nthese other districts, as they, too, lack a\nstrong presence in this area. Activity in\nthis area is generally drawn to shopping\nmalls in outlying areas such as Dedham.\nFinally, entertainment is the category\nin which Roslindale suffers the most in\ncomparison, as it is the only district among\nthe three that does not have a cinema.\nOrange indicates the trade area\nused to calculate Roslindale\npurchasing power\nThe red square outlines\nRoslindale Village\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nA view of South Street\nfrom Adams Park.\nConclusion\nThe Roslindale Village business district\npossess a multitude of\nassets that\ncan continue to fuel its growth and\ndevelopment.\nThe district's landmarks,\nstriking architectural views, diversity of\nbuilding typologies, and accessible open\nspaces, provide an opportunity to enhance\nthe village identity and to better serve area\nbusinesses. The increasing racial and ethnic\ndiversity of residents brings to the district\na wealth of cultural experiences and unique\ncustomer preferences.\nIn response, the\nneighborhood has made inroads in the\nfull-service restaurant sector and has the\ncapacity to continue this growth.\nWhile the district's various assets serve\nas a strong base from which to continue\ndevelopment, RVMS is currently faced with\ncertain challenges. Traffic and congestion\ncreate barriers for pedestrian shoppers\nand poses safety concerns, and a number\nof vacant lots and buildings disrupt the\ncontinuous fabric of the district core. While\nthese properties are currently detractions,\nthey pose an excellent opportunity for\nfurther investment and growth if efforts are\nmade to ensure that incoming uses fit the\nexisting character. Furthermore, Roslindale\nresidents' spending power has not been fully\ntapped, as local businesses capture less of\nthe activity that their potential customer\nbase can sustain. A more careful alignment\nof goods and services with area demands\nwould enable Roslindale businesses to\ncapitalize on the neighborhood's full\npotential and could attract customers from\nbeyond the immediate surroundings.\nWith a strong district image and a strategy\nthat weaves together the character of the\ndistrict - its strong cultural diversity, village\nhistory, and a strong sense of place--\nRoslindale Village can surpass its already\nimpressive achievements.\nChapter 1 - Existing Conditions - Conclusions\n\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nChapter 2 - Village Elements\n\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nRoslindale Village has a long history of being\na thriving family neighborhood, rich multi-\nethnic community, and pioneering Main\nStreets district.\nRoslindale Village Main\nStreets has helped to transform Roslindale\nVillage from a depressed commercial center\nin the 1980's to the attractive and growing\nbusiness district that exists today. What\nmakes Roslindale Village unique is that it is\nnot merely a commercial district, but a true\nurban village. More than just a small town\nwithin a city, an urban village is defined by\nthe following six elements:\n- Sense of place: conveys a unique image\nthat is distinct from its surrounding\ncommunities\n- Commercial needs: meets the varied\ncommercial needs of all residents\n- Walkable: village is safe and welcoming\nto pedestrians\n- Mix of uses: offers a range of\ncommercial, retail, and service-oriented\nuses\n- Civic center: built around a civic center\nthat serves community needs\n- Continual activity: supports activity that\noccurs throughout the day and into the\nnight\nOver time, Roslindale has grown to\nencompass all of the above elements\nthrough the collective hard work and civic-\nmindedness of businesses and residents\nalike.\nRoslindale's village character will\ncontinue to be the key to its growth and\nprosperity in coming years.\nHowever,\nlooking forward, Roslindale Village faces\nnew challenges. The area's business mix is\nevolving, the population is changing, and\ncompetition from surrounding districts is\nincreasing.\nGoing forward, RVMS' goal is to enhance the\nvillage, not only to preserve the district's\nvillage qualities, but to ensure that changes\nin the district build upon, rather than detract\nfrom, the village character. New residents\nand businesses can provide the energy,\ncommitment, and resources to make the\nvillage even stronger. Analysis of the district\npoints to eight key elements that provide the\ngreatest potential for enhancing Roslindale's\nvillage character.\n-\nAdams Park\n-\nGateways\n-\nTraffic\n-\nParking\n-\nStreetscape\n-\nBusiness Mix\n-\nDistrict Image\n-\nWashington Street\nThe following chapter provides an overview,\ngoals, strategies, and implementation tools\nto use in advancing each of these key\nelements. The chapter provides short-term\nstrategies that produce fast results and help\nbuild momentum for continued progress,\nand long-term strategies that provide\nvisions toward which Roslindale Village can\ndirect development and planning. These\nelements can be addressed in any order as\nthe opportunity arises.\nIntroduction\n\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nOverview\nAdams Park may be the single most\nvaluable and unique aspect of Roslindale.\nUnlike many other Main Streets in Boston,\nRoslindale Village is shaped around a square\nand possesses a sizeable amount of green\nspace, both rare features in Boston. Adams\nPark is the quintessential space that defines\nRoslindale as a village. Today, the park is\nwell maintained but is not used to its full\npotential.\nIf the park were enhanced,\nRoslindale businesses could capitalize on\nthis valuable asset. Future enhancements\nin Roslindale Village should address\nthe currently underused and relatively\ndisconnected character of Adams Park in\norder to exploit this very special resource.\nGoals\n- Make Adams Park the heart of Roslindale\nVillage\n- Define connections between Adams Park\nand surrounding businesses\n- Enhance civic life in Adams Park\nAdams Park is now used mainly\nas a pedestrian walkway except\nduring events\nThe enhancement of Adams Park\ncould create a more vital public\nspace\nand\nsupport\nadjacent\nbusinesses\nAdams Park\n\nStrategies\nShort Term\n1 Promote Events on Poplar Street and Adams\nPark\nIncluding Poplar Street in events that involve\nthe use of Adams Park effectively extends\nthe public space of the park, creating a\nvibrant center that can accommodate the\ncommunity's most convivial activities. Poplar\nStreet events could also serve as a capacity\nand community-building project; a Poplar\nStreets Events Committee, spearheaded by\nRoslindale Village Main Streets, supported\nby local volunteers, Poplar Street businesses,\nand corporate sponsors, could plan and\noperate community events.\n2 Engage Businesses on Poplar Street\nRoslindale Village Main Streets should assist\nbusinesses along Poplar Street in order\nto realize the business potential of their\nproximity to Adams Park. Such assistance\ncould take the form of active recruitment of\nbusiness and property owners in the idea of\nan activated space and providing assistance\nin securing permitting for outdoor seating.\nLimited streetscape and street furniture\nimprovements could help promote active\npatronage of participating businesses.\n3 Improve Streetscape and Landscape\nCalming traffic around Adams park is a\nnecessary element of both reconnecting\nthe green to the Village and enhancing\nthe pedestrian experience in the district.\nStrategically located traffic signage and\nroad-painting would help slow traffic\nand mitigate pedestrian hesitance.\nWith\na more inviting street edge, Adams Park\ncould attract much more active use, while\nimplementing an inviting landscaping and\nfurniture program would enhance the\nexperience while in the park. These efforts\nlend themselves as tools to engage the\nresidential and business community to take\nownership and enjoy their village common.\nLong term\n1 Make Poplar Street a pedestrian promenade\nalong park edge\nAdams Park should connect directly to\nPoplar Street in the form of a pedestrian\npromenade.\nThis connection would\nactivate the park, businesses, and residential\ncommunity who enjoy Roslindale Village.\nThis new promenade would create an active\nspace that could be used for outdoor dining\nand strolling, heightening the shopping and\npedestrian experience.\nThe promenade\nwould also extend the natural point of\naccess to Adams Park, expanding the area\nof recreational space in the village. The\nPoplar Promenade could also be the site for\ncommunity activities at many scales, such as\na farmer's market, festivals, or an art fair.\nThe pedestrian walkway could be a boon to\nbusinesses along Poplar Street. At present,\nheavy traffic and double-parked cars on\nPoplar Street restrict store visibility and\npatronage. As a pedestrian promenade,\nPoplar Street could help identify Roslindale\nVillage as a destination point in Boston,\ndrawing customers from around the region\nto enjoy the afternoon in the city's most\nclassic urban village.\nPrior to the Poplar Street closure, traffic\nalong Washington Street would have to be\nrerouted so as to allow for two-way traffic\nalong the length of the corridor (discussed\nfurther on page 63-65).\nImplementation\nLandscape improvements in Adams Park\nshould be made to help mitigate noise\nfrom Washington Street and to encourage\ninteraction with businesses along Poplar\nStreet. A possible funding source for\nthese\nlandscape\nimprovements\ncould\ncome from the City of Boston's NICE\nprogram (Neighborhood Improvements\nthrough Capital Expenditure), administered\nby the Department of Neighborhood\nDevelopment. The program is aimed at\nproviding interested neighborhood groups\nwith the means to implement enhancement\nprojects in their community. Street furniture\nand signage enhancements could also be\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nfunded through the Boston Foundation.\nCorporate/business sponsorship could be\nconsidered as well to mitigate the costs of\norganizing street closure events. The Main\nStreet program in Libertyville, Illinois for\nexample, actively courts local businesses and\nemployers to sponsor street programs in the\ndistrict. This sponsorship not only pays the\nadministrative and operational costs of the\nevents, but has proved to be a source of\nincome for the Main Street program.\nLooking\ndown\nPoplar\nStreet\ntowards the Roslindale Branch\nPublic Library\nA vision for potential pedestrian\npromenade on what is currently\nPoplar Street\nChapter 2 - Village Enhancing Elements - Adams Park\n\nOngoing RVMS events in Adams Park\nshould be expanded to include the sidewalks\nalong Poplar Street. In order for the long-\nterm feasibility of street closure to exist, it\nis important that business affected by such\nan endeavor be amenable to the change.\nIt is recommended that temporary street\nclosures be explored for demonstration\npurposes. Outdoor dining, vending, and\nstreet events along Poplar Street would\nserve the dual purpose of promoting\nuse of Adams Park and the enjoyment\nof Roslindale Village, while encouraging\ndirect patronage of the businesses along\nthe street. Such action could demonstrate\nto merchants and property owners the\npossibility of increased sales revenue.\nThese short-term closures could then be\nextended as popularity increases.\nWidening the sidewalks on Poplar Street\nwould allow for trees, planters, and outdoor\nseating, increasing pedestrian activity and\nmaking the street more attractive to patrons\nand visitors.\nThis measure would allow\nreduced traffic to pass through the street if\nit remained open, or would allow delivery\naccess if the street were closed.\nCase Study: Poplar Pedestrian Way\n\nPrevious page: Pedestrian crosswalk\non Poplar Street facing Adams Park\nin the winter\nLeft: A vision for Adams Park and\npedestrian promenade on what is\ncurrently Poplar Street\nChapter 2 - Village Enhancing Elements - Adams Park\n\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nOverview\nCurrently, it is very easy for a driver or bus\nrider to pass through Roslindale Village\nwithout noticing that he or she has entered\nor left the district. People who are familiar\nwith Roslindale have an understanding of\nthe Village boundaries, but these gateways\nshould take a physical form that is readily\napparent to passers by. Distinct gateways\ndeclare arrival at a unique place - an urban\nvillage - by clearly marking beginning and\nend points. Five gateways to Roslindale's\nbusiness district have been identified:\n(1) Washington Street at Kittredge Street\n(2) Washington Street at Lee Hill Road\n(3) Cummins Highway approaching Adams\nPark at Washington Street\n(4) The MBTA commuter rail station and\npedestrian tunnel at the intersection\nof Belgrade Avenue, Birch Street and\nSouth Street\n(5) The intersection at Alexander the Great\nPark at Robert Street, Corinth Street,\nand Belgrade Avenue.\nGoals\n- Announce visitors' arrival into the\nVillage by clearly demarcating entry\npoints\n- Portray a memorable identity of\nRoslindale Village to residents and\nvisitors\nAerial view of Roslindale Village\nbusiness\ndistrict\nhighlighting\nthe gateways to the Main Streets\nDistrict\nGateways to Roslindale Village\n\nStrategies\nShort Term\n1. Install visible and attractive welcome signs\nRVMS should create distinctive logos and\nsignage that mark the gateways to Roslindale\nVillage.\n2. Use public art to mark gateways\nRVMS has been extremely effective in\nbringing public art into the district, such as\nthe sculpture recently commissioned for the\nmedian on Belgrade Avenue. RVMS should\ncontinue its efforts to bring art into public\nspaces in Roslindale Village.\nLong Term\n3. Improve landscaping and streetscape\nAny strategy RVMS pursues for improving\nlandscaping and streetscape should include\nspecial demarcation of the gateways to the\nvillage. Such improvements could include\ndistinctive paving, plantings, banners, and\npublic act.\n(Please refer to streetscape\nsection for detailed recommendations on\nimplementation).\n4. Encourage village-scale redevelopment at key\ngateway locations\nNew\nconstruction\nof\nvillage-scale\ndevelopment at key parcels, two to three\nstoreys in height, will boldly signal entry\ninto a dynamic business district.\nParcels\nsuch as the parking lot behind Higgins\nFuneral Home or that of the MBTA\ntransfer station, present opportunities for\nsuch redevelopment.\nImplementation\nWork with businesses situated at gateway\nsites to install short-term signage and\nmarkers. For example, a banner could be\naffixed to the MBTA substation or strung\nacross Washington Street at Lee Hill Road.\nA possible funding source is the City of\nBoston's Small Changes Beautification\nprogram, which provides small grants for\nneighborhood improvement.\nWhile temporary streetscape improvements\ncan define a gateway, it is important to\nremember that a gateway marker is a\npowerful image in the minds of visitors.\nTherefore, the long-term goal should be\npermanent, well designed gateways that\nreflect the true character of Roslindale\nVillage.\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nTrees, landscaping, and signage\nmark\nthe\ncivic\ngateway\non\nCummings Highway\nChapter 2 - Village Enhancing Elements - Gateways to Roslindale\n\nEnhancing the Commuter T Rail Stop\nas Pedestrian Gateway\nThe Roslindale Commuter T stop, located at\nSouth and Belgrade, receives 500 passengers\neach day, making it the most frequently used\ncommuter station on the Needham Line.\nPresently, the Roslindale commuter T stop\nserves as one point of entry into the district,\nan access point for passengers disembarking\nthe train and for residents coming from west\nRoslindale into the district core. The goals\nof a design intervention at this site would\nbe to better position the commuter rail T\nstop as an important gateway for visitors to\nRoslindale and nearby residents entering the\ndistrict core. Creating a sense of place at\nthis site helps to announce visitors' arrival\ninto the Village core.\nA painted mural or tile mosaic could be\ninstalled in the pedestrian tunnel, creating\na vibrant passageway for pedestrians\nalerting them to the district's unique history\nand multicultural character. Enhanced\nlandscaping of the sidewalk outcrop in the\neast parking lot, installing trees or planters,\nand greened trellises along the concrete\nstairway wall can soften the appearance of\nthis area and make it a more pleasant space\nto pass through or await the arrival of a car\nor train. Specialized paving on the outcrop\ncould enhance its appearance and could be\nextended as a pedestrian walkway through\nthe parking lot directing visitors toward\nbusinesses located on South Street, Birch\nStreet and Belgrade Avenue.\nCase Study: Pedestrian Gateway\n\nPrevious page: Current view of\nthe pedestrian tunnel at the MBTA\ncommuter rail stop, heading into\nthe district.\nLeft:\nVision\nfor\nlandscape\nimprovements\nand\npublic\nart\ninstallation\nat\nthe\npedestrian\ntunnel.\nChapter 2 - Village Enhancing Elements - Gateways to Roslindale\n\nLocated on the prominent southwest corner\nof Cummins Highway and Washington\nStreet, the former MBTA substation, a\nhistoric 5-storey brick structure, presents\nan important redevelopment opportunity\nfor the Village. According to the feasibility\nstudy drafted by Historic Boston, both\nthe exterior masonry of the building and\nthe interior elements are in overall \"good\"\ncondition.\nIn addition, an engineer has\nconcluded that the building structure is\nin \"very good\" condition.\nAdditionally,\nthere is no evidence of environmental\ncontamination. The MBTA building could\nbe activated with multiple uses that speak\nto both the historic context of the building\nand its relationship to the Village Square.\nThe ground floor should contain retail\nuses that employ the unique architectural\nfacade, while artists' lofts or residential\ncondominiums, which would enliven the\nspace and provide an economic motivation\nfor redevelopment, would occupy the upper\nfloors. RVMS has considered the possibility\nof integrating cultural space into the\nredevelopment, such as art studios or a small\nplayhouse. A successful intervention at this\nsite might include redevelopment of the\nadjacent parcels, including a small portion\nof the Higgins Funeral Home parking lots\nand the adjoining Pearce parcel.\nCase Study: Civic Gateway\n\nPrevious page: Current view of\nthe MBTA substation at corner of\nWashington Street and Cummings\nHighway\nBelow: Vision for the an addition\nto the MBTA substation with\nparking in the rear\nChapter 2 - Village Enhancing Elements - Gateways to Roslindale\n\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nOverview\nRoslindale Village Main Streets has made\ngreat strides in cleaning up and refurbishing\nRoslindale Village. Nonetheless, businesses\nowners are looking to further improve the\nphysical image of the district. Most business\nowners are unhappy with the district's\ncleanliness and indicated a willingness\nto participate in a clean-up effort. More\nbenches, trees, and other landscaping\nwould make the district more inviting. A\nplan for Roslindale village needs to address\nstreetscape and signage in order instill a\nsense of place and depict the community's\ndistinct identity to visitors and residents.\nGoals\n- Use streetscape improvements to instill a\nsense of place\n- Beautify and clean the district\nPlan\ndepicting\ntree\nplantings\nthroughout the business district\nStreetscape Improvements\n\nStrategies\nShort Term\nPromote attractive storefronts, signage, and\nlighting\nBy continuing its highly successful effort to\nupgrade business facades, RVMS can further\ncreate the look of a distinctive, attractive,\nand cared-for local business district.\n2 Develop beautification and cleanliness initiatives\nLocal businesses value a clean, well-kept\nenvironment, and many are willing to\nparticipate in small-scale beautification\nefforts that will create a more comfortable\nexperience for customers in the district.\nRVMS might wish to levy this interest in\ndeveloping future projects.\nLong Term:\n3 Introduce urban furniture in open spaces\nIntroducing street furniture, such as benches\nand tables, creates gathering spots that are\ninviting and promote social interaction\nbetween visitors.\n4 Green the district\nHistorically, Washington Street stood as\na tree-lined boulevard, enclosing drivers\nand pedestrians with a canopy of tall elms\nthat provided shade from summer sun.\nReplanting the areas on Washington Street\nand Cummins Highway where trees are\npresently lacking would cultivate the feel of\na greened boulevard. Trees provide a buffer\nbetween pedestrians and moving traffic and\naid in signaling to drivers that they have\nentered a commercial zone.\n5 Consider specialized pavement (e.g. brick,\ncobblestones) in key locations\nSpecialized pavements delineate village\nboundaries, enhance a sense of place, and\nserve to direct patrons through the business\ndistrict.\nEnhancing the Village: Roslindale Village Main Streets\n\nImplementation\nRVMS is not in the position to fund all\nstreetscape\nimprovements,\nhowever\nit\ncan use its extensive connections with\nbusiness owners and professionals to defray\nimplementation costs. RVMS may also want\nto work with business owners to develop\nsidewalk\nand\nlandscape\nmaintenance\nstrategies for their storefronts. One way this\nmay take place is through the exploration\nof innovative programs such as \"Adopt a\nSidewalk,\" where a business may choose\nto finance and supervise the maintenance\nof abutting property. RVMS could also\nsponsor a program that allows local\nbusinesses and residents to purchase trees\nor planters. Low-cost maintenance, such\nas graffiti removal or tree grooming, plants\nand flowers, could come from community\nservice events or volunteer and youth\nprograms.\nIn the long run, the City of Boston may be\nan important source of funding for RVMS\nstreetscape and greening improvements. The\nCity's Small Changes Beautification grant\nprogram is one possible source of funding.\nSmall Changes awards grants of $1,000 to\n$5,000 for general projects, involving youth\nstewardship in environmental education,\nclean up and waste removal, professional\nplanting, and graffiti removal. Grants in\nthe amount of $5,000 to $20,000 can be\nput toward permanent installment projects,\nsuch as benches, paving, murals, plaques\nand external architecture and lighting.\nMayor Menino's Garden Contest is another\nprogram in which RVMS may wish to\nparticipate. Winners' funds can be applied\nto community and storefront gardens.\nPrevious page: Washington Street\nis not currently a pleasant place\nfor pedestrians\nLeft:\nSmall\nchanges\ncan\ngreatly improve the pedestrian\nenvironment on Washington\nChapter 2 - Village Enhancing Elements - Streetscape Improvements"

      "content": "Inner City Commercial Revitalization: A Literature Review\n\nBy Karl F. Seidman\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAfter decades of decline, cities are rebounding, and one key to bringing urban areas back to life\nis revitalizing commercial districts. There are different approaches to doing that, a lot of\nchallenges, and not a lot of \"how-to\" books. This report draws on the existing literature on the\nrevitalization of inner-city commercial districts to examine alternative approaches -- including\nthe popular Main Street strategy -- and identify best practices.\n\nBecause there is limited literature that focuses exclusively on inner-city commercial districts, the\nreport draws selectively from a more extensive base of research that encompasses inner-city\nneighborhood revitalization, neighborhood economic development, and downtown development.\nThis is the second of four reports in a study, funded by the Fannie Mae Foundation, on the use of\nthe Main Street approach to revitalize inner-city business districts.\n\nCauses of Inner-City Business District Decline\n\nSeveral forces are commonly cited as contributing to the decline of American inner-city business\ndistricts: demographic shifts that left poor people behind in cities while many people moved to\nthe suburbs; federal policies that favored suburban over central-city investment; state and local\nzoning and tax policies that contributed to business flight to the suburbs; and mortgage policies\nthat were explicitly biased toward suburban properties.\n\nRevitalization Opportunities and Obstacles\n\nSuccessful revitalization approaches need to capitalize on the opportunities presented in inner-\ncity neighborhoods while addressing long-standing obstacles to their rebirth.\n\nDespite the long period of population loss and disinvestment, urban neighborhoods have assets\nand positive trends that can fuel revitalization. Many of the positives simply went unrecognized\nfor years. Michael Porter's often-cited 1995 article, \"The Competitive Advantage of the Inner\nCity,\" identified four key competitive advantages in inner cities: 1) strategic location near the\ncity center, transportation, and entertainment and tourist centers; 2) local market demand\nreflected in high density that compensates for lower incomes, and specialized urban ethnic\nmarket niches; 3) integration with regional clusters (defined as collections of related companies)\nthat create business opportunities; and 4) a moderate-wage workforce.\n\nSeveral other studies have documented the large inner-city market and found it underserved. A\nstudy for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development identified 48 inner cities\nwhere local purchasing power exceeded retail sales by several hundred million dollars.. With\nhigher population density in the urban areas, the income and retail demand per square mile were\nfound to be greater for inner-city neighborhoods than in other areas. Urban neighborhoods also\nhave concentrated market segments: black, Hispanic, and youth markets, as well as ethnic\nmarkets supported by concentrations of immigrant populations.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nThe existing building stock is another potential asset in urban commercial districts because\nbuildings with historic value can attract residents and investors interested in architectural and\nhistoric preservation. On the other hand, although inner-city neighborhoods generally have a\nsupply of vacant and underutilized land and buildings, the relative cost of locating there can be\nan obstacle. The reviews on this point are mixed.\n\nSeveral decades of community development work in cities, supported by government and\nfoundation funding, has led to capacity advantages for revitalization work in urban\nneighborhoods. Federal policies and subsidies provide considerable incentives for urban\nreinvestment, including the Community Reinvestment Act, Community Development Block\nGrants, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, and strategies that support reuse of contaminated\nbrownfield sites.\n\nDespite urban neighborhoods' assets, many obstacles continue to impede redevelopment of\ncommercial districts. Research identifies six major obstacles: 1) decaying physical conditions; 2)\npoor customer and investor perceptions of neighborhoods; 3) difficulties in coordinating the\nactions of property owners, businesses, and local government; 4) a business environment that is\nmore costly and complex than in suburban locations; 5) the limited capacity and quality of\nbusinesses serving urban commercial districts; and 6) limited access to capital.\n\nRevitalization Strategies\n\nTo leverage assets and overcome obstacles, a variety of revitalization strategies have been used\nto revitalize urban commercial districts. Much of the literature on those strategies has been\nframed within two policy debates: the merits of place-based versus people-based approaches, and\nthe question of neighborhood versus regional development approaches.\n\nFollowers of the people-based approach argue that improving inner-city residents' well-being is\na prerequisite to successful community revitalization and is the ultimate policy goal. Place-based\nadherents consider improving neighborhood conditions is a sound goal even if not all poverty is\neliminated. Several researchers show the pitfalls of following one approach or the other and\nadvocate strategies that address both people and place. Commercial district revitalization\nstrategies implicitly accept the place-based approach, but can contribute to improving residents'\nopportunities.\n\nThe second strategy debate focuses on the significance of the neighborhood as a geographic unit\nfor economic development initiatives -- a key theme in the debate being the regional nature of\neconomies. Some scholars either argue that neighborhoods are not an important focus for\neconomic development, or that opportunities in neighborhoods must be directly tied to the\nregional economy. Others contend that a healthy neighborhood economy benefits residents and\nhelps connect them to regional economic opportunities.\n\nThis report defines six types of commercial district revitalization strategies:\n\n1. Comprehensive community initiatives (CCIs) attempt to simultaneously address multiple\nobstacles to revitalization. An early example is the Model Cities program of the 1960s, the\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nimpact of which is not clear because little evaluation was done. A wave of foundation-funded\nCCIs in the early 1990s have had mixed reviews, but their lessons included the importance of\nbuilding consensus on the problem and solutions, having strong leadership and management,\nand ensuring resident involvement.\n\nThe federal Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community program, enacted in 1993, was based\non the CCI model. The most comprehensive study of the program found an emphasis on\nbusiness development, and positive outcomes in terms of growth in resident employment and\nbusiness ownership. Success factors cited in the study included: a clear strategic vision that\nwas shared among stakeholders; the need for strong leadership and strong staff capacity; and\nthe critical role played by technical assistance in business development efforts. It also found\nthat collaborations among government, businesses, and community-based organizations,\nwere very valuable and brought \"different perspectives, networks, and resources to bear\" on\nsolving problems.\n\n2. Enterprise zones use tax incentives and regulatory relief to attract investment to blighted\nurban districts. The concept was imported from Great Britain and has been used primarily by\nstates. Studies of state programs have shown some success in job growth and investment, but\nthat targeted development incentives alone are insufficient to revitalize a district. Research\nalso identified a stable economic base and plenty of available commercial and industrial land\nas important for success.\n\n3. Housing-based strategies focus on rebuilding a neighborhood's residential base as a\nfoundation for commercial district revitalization. Much inner-city housing development is\nsponsored by community development corporations (CDCs), but they typically have limited\ncapacities. Researchers point to public-private partnerships, homeownership programs, and a\ncombination of large-scale and small housing development projects as successful approaches.\n\n4. Commercial real estate-based strategies use physical development through either catalytic or\nincremental projects to reposition urban business districts to compete with the suburbs as\nboth shopping and employment centers. Supermarkets and chain stores can anchor a district,\nbut the literature suggests that strategies must also address how to fit locally owned\nbusinesses into the mix. Difficulties inherent in urban neighborhood commercial\ndevelopment include lack of commitment on the part of local institutions, the complexity of\nsite assembly and financing for larger projects, and regulatory barriers. Lessons from the\nliterature suggest that no single type of development, defined by either use or scale, is\nessential for neighborhood commercial district revitalization. Other lessons are that\nrevitalization impacts result from a combination of physical improvement, and that\npartnerships and complementary investments are key -- among nonprofit organizations,\nprivate businesses and developers, faith-based organizations, and government.\n\n5. Business development and attraction strategies provide financial and technical assistance to\nnurture the startup and growth of small locally owned businesses to help stabilize the district\nand provide jobs for residents. Many early community development corporations focused on\nbusiness development, and there is a recent trend toward creation of neighborhood-based\nbusiness development networks among CDCs and other nonprofit organizations.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\n6. District management strategies try to match some of the advantages of shopping malls by\ncoordinating such things as hours, appearance, and marketing among business and property\nowners. There are three broad district management approaches: 1) business improvement\ndistricts (BIDs), 2) centralized retail management, and 3) the Main Street program.\n\nBIDs are a legal mechanism through which private businesses and property owners tax\nthemselves to fund services, projects, and activities to improve a defined business district. One\nstudy found more than 400 BIDs in the United States, and identified the most common activities\nas consumer marketing, maintenance (e.g., cleaning, graffiti and snow removal), policy\nadvocacy, and capital improvements.\n\nBIDs have no defined strategy for achieving revitalization, but do have some key advantages.\nBIDs have a stable funding base and the mandatory financial participation of property owners in\nthe district. Also, their connection to local governments may help to mobilize government\nsupport and investment in related projects. Two disadvantages of BIDs are the long time needed\nto organize one and the absence of any mechanism for participation by other stakeholders, most\nnotably, residents.\n\nCentralized retail management is a strategy involving formal contractual arrangements among\nproperty owners to jointly fund and undertake activities. It reportedly is difficult to implement,\nrarely used, and has been called a \"failure\" by a leading downtown consultant.\n\nThe Main Street program is the most widely used approach to business district management.\nDeveloped by the National Trust for Historic Preservation based on work in towns and small\ncities, the approach is still evolving as a strategy for revitalization of inner-city commercial\ndistricts. The Main Street model is based on a four key points: 1) organization (often cited as the\nmost important), 2) design, 3) promotion, and 4) economic restructuring.\n\nMain Street theory does not address several typical urban problems, such as crime and\nhomelessness, and may have to be adapted to get around urban environmental factors, such as\ncynicism based on past failures and competition from other city commercial districts. The\nNational Main Street Center tested the Main Street approach in urban areas during the 1980s. A\nstudy of that effort found that urban neighborhood districts required more time, outreach and\ncommunication to implement the Main Street approach than did downtown business districts, but\nthat the Main Street incremental approach and retail focus was a better fit for neighborhoods\nLessons drawn from the demonstration program suggest that urban Main Street programs could\nbe implemented by either a separate or existing organization, but its mission and capacity were\ncritical considerations. Promotional activities early on were identified as an important way to get\nthe ball rolling. Small design improvements were also key. Economic restructuring was the most\ndifficult activity to implement.\n\nSeveral factors make the Main Street framework well suited to leveraging inner-city\nopportunities and advantages. Its emphasis on physical improvements, promotional activities,\nand economic restructuring are good fits for urban districts, although some areas may require\nlarger-scale physical interventions than called for by Main Street's incremental approach.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nOn the other hand, the Main Street framework is not oriented to capitalize on some inner-city\nopportunities. The economic focus is primarily on the local retail level, with no attention to\nconnecting the district with the regional economy, nor is there any emphasis on expanding access\nto capital. Also, it does not address public safety, workforce development, or weak social norms\nand networks.\n\nThe Main Street program takes a broader approach to business district revitalization than do most\nalternative models. It is not comprehensive within the community development context,\nhowever, because it does not address many of the social, housing, and employment issues facing\nlow-income communities. The Main Street model's incremental approach varies from other\nstrategies and, because it requires fewer resources and less capacity to get started, it can generate\nshort-term results. The focus on using volunteers also sets the Main Street framework apart from\nother strategies. Although the volunteer approach is compatible with grassroots community\ndevelopment efforts, it can pose a greater obstacle in urban neighborhoods than in other Main\nStreet settings. Among other factors, funders may be skeptical of the capacity of a volunteer-\nbased organization to get results.\n\nBest Practices\n\nThe literature suggests best practices for inner-city commercial district revitalization across four\nbroad components of practice: 1) institutional capacity, 2) planning and process, 3) strategies,\nand 4) tools and techniques.\n\nInstitutional Capacity\n\nAmong the most common issues addressed in the neighborhood revitalization literature are the\nrole of institutional capacity and the relative importance of the public, private, and nonprofit\nsectors. An entire book is devoted to critiquing Porter's emphasis on private business\ndevelopment. Some analysts argue that public sector must take the lead, while others emphasize\nthe importance of community-based initiatives. One study categorizes organizational players by\ntheir product -- housing, policing, education, etc. -- and their level, which defines their distance\nfrom the resident action, from volunteer engagement to national-level support. The conceptual\nframework suggests the reality and necessity of involving institutions across different levels and\nsectors.\n\nOther literature reinforces the need for collaboration among stakeholders, the commitment and\ninvolvement of local institutions, and leveraging of resources from external organizations. Also\nidentified as important was effective city leadership and partnerships between community\norganizations and the city government. Networks of communication, resources, and support can\nextend the capacity of locally led renewal efforts, and national intermediaries can support such\nnetworks. Weak capacity among local organizations attempting to implement revitalizations was\ncited as being a limiting factor.\n\nThe Main Street approach's heavy reliance on volunteers is a concern for urban implementation,\nbut the literature suggests that Main Street partner with community-based, government, and\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nprivate-sector organizations. Analysts caution that building effective partnerships will take time\nand trust to develop, and must be based on a shared vision and goals.\n\nPlanning and Process\n\nLessons from the literature emphasize the importance of broad stakeholder participation, creating\na shared vision, building consensus on goals and plans, and conducting ongoing outreach and\ncommunication. The Main Street model supports this emphasis, although urban programs may\nneed to conduct more outreach than is needed in other areas.\n\nStrategies\n\nAlthough many authors have opinions about what constitutes an effective inner-city economic\ndevelopment strategy, little empirical research has tested the effectiveness of specific strategies.\nThe case study literature that is available deals with several key areas: integrating people- and\nplace-based strategies; the type and character of commercial development projects, including the\nrelative role of independent versus chain stores; inner-city business development opportunities;\nand addressing gentrification.\n\nAlthough commercial district revitalization is inherently a place-based strategy, some projects\nhave incorporated people-based efforts, largely around linking local residents to jobs. The nature\nof the jobs in commercial district -- mostly retail and personal service positions -- tends to limit\nopportunities for resident advancement. This limitation could be addressed by using entry-level\npositions as a youth development program, and by connecting local jobs to better-paying ones in\nthe regional economy.\n\nCommercial development strategies are driven by two key issues regarding character: one\nconcerns redevelopment versus building reuse, and the other is whether to focus on attracting\nnational chain stores versus supporting local independent businesses. The two issues are\ninterrelated because national retailers often require new development to support their large\nformats. The Main Street framework emphasizes historic preservation, but some analysts argue\nthat inner-city building stock is typically too deteriorated to be reused or that building sites must\nbe reconfigured to attract retailers.\n\nRegarding store types, the need to compete with shopping malls suggests a preference for\nattracting chain stores, but failing to support local businesses can eradicate an urban\nneighborhood's unique character. Communities must reach their own resolutions about the right\napproach, but best practice is likely to require a combination of redevelopment and building\nreuse while attracting chain stores and supporting local independent businesses. Existing practice\nsuggests that redevelopment can complement the existing district character. Practice also\nidentifies several ways that chain store development can be linked to supporting a base of locally\nowned businesses through: integration of stores so independent retailers benefit from customer\ntraffic generated by anchor stores; technical assistance to help local retailers adjust to and take\nadvantage of the benefits of having chain stores nearby; and maintaining a strong base of local\nbusinesses to retain the neighborhood's character.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nThe literature identifies two important best practices for formulating and implementing business\ndevelopment strategies. The first is that business attraction and development opportunities must\nbe linked to real market opportunities. An important concept in defining these opportunities is\nthe distinction between convenience and comparison goods. All business districts can support\nconvenience destinations that customers choose based on proximity and convenience. For\ncomparison goods, shoppers seek an agglomeration of stores with similar or related products.\nSuccessful strategies can be based on expanding the existing concentration of comparison goods\nstores or attracting multiple new stores in the same category.\n\nThe second best practice for developing business opportunity strategies is the need to link small\nbusinesses to training, technical assistance, and financing. Local Main Street programs and other\ncommunity-based organizations generally don't have this capacity, but there are three models for\ndeveloping networks to provide such support. They include referral networks, trade associations,\nand independent buying agents to serve locally owned businesses.\n\nTools and Techniques\n\nPractice-oriented studies identify effective tools, techniques, and strategies for commercial\ndistrict revitalization. Best practices can be categorized as relating to physical improvement and\ncommercial development; business development; marketing and promotion; and districtwide\ncoordination and management.\n\nMost commercial revitalization strategies emphasize physical improvements to eliminate blight\nand improve the area's image so the area can attract shoppers and businesses. Studies suggest\nthree key elements of successful strategies: 1) outreach and education to increase understanding\nof the impact of good design and physical improvement; 2) technical assistance to help\nbusinesses and property owners prepare a good design and manage the permitting process; and 3)\nfinancial assistance through grants, low-interest loans, or both to encourage property and\nbusiness owners to make improvements.\n\nBusiness development efforts encompass retaining and expanding existing businesses as well as\nattracting new ones. Several studies point to the importance of providing technical assistance to\nexisting businesses, including basic business planning, help in securing loans, assistance in\nobtaining government licenses and permits, advice on merchandising and marketing, and\nreferrals to specialized professionals and service providers.\n\nStrategies to attract new businesses should focus on meeting unmet convenience shopping needs\nor creating synergies with existing retail niches. Getting an anchor store is a priority for districts\nwith no or very few anchor destinations. Although there is no consensus about what constitute\nbest practice for recruiting new businesses, suggestions include holding business recruitment\nfairs, matching prospective businesses to property owners with vacant space, and helping\nbusinesses to secure city permits.\n\nMarketing and promotion activities are central to improving a commercial district's image, and\ncan be implemented quickly to provide some short-term impact. Best practice literature focuses\non the importance of four aspects: conducting market analysis to inform marketing activities,\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\ncreating an overall district image, using community events for promotion, and organizing retail\npromotions among merchants.\n\nSeveral practices are particularly important to effective districtwide coordination of revitalization\nactivities. There must be a broadly shared vision for the revitalization and broad buy-in to plan,\nbased on active participation of key stakeholders. Ongoing research and communication are\nneeded to keep stakeholders informed of progress, attract new support, and remind people of the\nplans and priorities. Special efforts are needed to cultivate the support of property owners, small\nmerchants, low-income residents, and linguistic minorities. Finally, several activities provide\nspecial opportunities to coordinate work across stakeholder groups districtwide: formulation of\ndesign guidelines, preparation of an improvement plan for public infrastructure and spaces, and\norganizing special events that are linked to promotions.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis literature review suggests that commercial district revitalization is an important component\nin place-based community development, but requires integration with other strategies to\novercome the long-standing demographic and economic forces that lead to inner-city\ndisinvestment and to generate overall neighborhood revitalization. Commercial revitalization\ninitiatives should be combined with housing improvement and development projects; sustained\ncrime reduction efforts; improved health, education, and family support services; and education\nand workforce development programs that link residents to job and career opportunities\nthroughout the regional economy as part of a comprehensive effort to create neighborhoodwide\nrevitalization that substantially benefits existing low- and moderate- income residents.\n\nThe Main Street strategy promises to be an effective approach to revitalizing inner-city\ncommercial districts if it is adapted to fit inner-city conditions. It provides a clearer framework\nfor action and a more comprehensive approach than other commercial district improvement\nstrategies. Its framework and range of activities leverage several advantages found in inner-city\nneighborhoods while addressing many of their obstacles to revitalization. The Main Street\nprogram, however, faces challenges to providing an effective framework and strategy for\nrevitalizing inner-city business districts.\n\nFirst, it needs to incorporate key inner-city concerns, such as public safety and the management\nof gentrification, into its strategic framework. Second, Main Street programs will require greater\nresources and capacity to address the challenges of inner-city neighborhoods, compared with\ntheir historic use in towns and small cities. This is likely to require a broader coalition and base\nof support, greater staff capacity, and more partnerships with other organizations. Third, greater\nattention to and subsidies for real estate development activities will be needed to address\nredevelopment of severely blighted properties and to attract key anchor businesses.\n\nMore targeted empirical research is needed to better identify best practices for inner-city\ncommercial district revitalization.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nIntroduction\n\nAfter decades of decline, cities are rebounding, and one key to bringing urban areas back\nto life is revitalizing old commercial districts. There are different approaches to doing it, a lot of\nchallenges, and not a lot of \"how-to\" books. This report provides a few how-to suggestions by\nsummarizing the existing scholarly and practitioner literature on the revitalization of inner-city\ncommercial districts.\nIts purpose is twofold. First, by reviewing the major factors that shape the environment\nfor improving inner-city business districts and the experience with other revitalization\napproaches, it considers how the popular Main Street approach1 -- mostly used in towns and\nsmall cities -- relates to and differs from other strategies. Second, it discusses the existing\nliterature on best practices to help inform future research. It is the second of four reports in a\nstudy, funded by the Fannie Mae Foundation, on the use of the Main Street approach to revitalize\ninner-city business districts. Because there is limited literature that focuses exclusively on inner-\ncity commercial districts, this report draws selectively from a more extensive base of research\nthat encompasses inner-city neighborhood revitalization, neighborhood economic development,\nand downtown development.\nThe report is organized in four sections. First, the causes for inner commercial district\ndecline are summarized. Second, research on the major obstacles and opportunities that affect\ncommercial revitalization are discussed. In the third section, the major strategies and approaches\nto neighborhood revitalization are reviewed and the Main Street approach is related to these past\n\n1 The Main Street approach was developed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Local organizations\nsponsor their own Main Street programs following a four-point revitalization model that includes organizational\ndevelopment, design, promotion and economic restructuring. The National Trust's National Main Street Center\nprovides technical assistance, general information, and networking opportunities. More information is available at\nwww.MainStreet.org. AUTHOR: CHANGE THIS TEXT YOU WISH, BUT WE NEED SOME DEFINITION UP\nFRONT - WE SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT EVERY READER IS FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nand current approaches. The final section summarizes current understanding on best practices in\nurban neighborhood business district revitalization across four dimensions: institutional capacity,\nthe planning and implementation process, strategies, and tools and techniques. A concluding\nsection provides an overall assessment of what the literature suggests about the potential and\nunique contribution of the Main Street approach.\nCauses of Inner-City Business District Decline\nSeveral forces frequently are cited as contributing to the decline of American inner-city\nbusiness districts in the post-war era. Major demographic shifts in American cities that led to\nboth a declining central-city population and a concentration of the poor in urban neighborhoods\nare key factors cited by many authors (Bright 2000; Grogan and Proscio 2000). These trends are\nevidenced by data showing the growing economic gap between city and suburb. The ratio of city\nto suburban median family income dropped from 89 percent in 1960 to 74 percent in 2000, while\ncentral-city poverty rates were more than double suburban rates in 2000.2 The large urban in-\nmigration of rural and southern African Americans, the movement of middle- and working-class\npopulations to the suburbs, and the closed immigration policies of the 1960s that kept new\nimmigrants from coming to the urban centers to replace the upwardly mobile (Ferguson 1999)\nwere the demographic forces underlying these changes.\nHowever, economic trends and public policies also contributed to inner-city decline.\nGrogan and Proscio point to dispersion incentives under federal policies that subsidized highway\nand suburban housing construction, along with redlining practices that favored suburban over\ncentral-city investment. Bright also attributes these changes to federal highway, banking, and\nhousing policies, and cites the role of state and local policies, including zoning and tax policies\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nthat contributed to business flight to the suburbs, property abandonment, and housing segregation\nby income.3 Mortgage policies under the Federal Housing Administration, in conjunction with\nthe withdrawal of credit and insurance by private banks and insurers, contributed to suburban\nflight, racial segregation, and inner-city disinvestment (Squires 1992; Zielenbach 2000).\nImplementation of federal urban renewal programs also contributed to both population decline\nand demographic change in urban neighborhoods (Ferguson 1999; Halpern 1996; Rucker 2001).\nOther authors have emphasized the role of local community institutions in accelerating or\nslowing suburban out-migration. In Urban Exodus, Gamm (1999) details how the differences in\nthe social basis and organization of Jewish and Catholic religious institutions led to different\npatterns of suburban out-migration in Boston's neighborhoods.\nThese demographic and income changes affected the viability of business districts that\nwere tied to surrounding residential neighborhoods. Many merchants followed their customer\nbases to the suburbs (Halpern 1996; Mulkeen 1997). Changes in the economic landscape with\nthe emergence of suburbs as employment and retail centers fueled inner-city business district\ndecline. William Julius Wilson (1996) emphasizes how the departure of urban manufacturing\nemployment concentrated unemployment and poverty in inner-city neighborhoods. Dickens\n(1999) disputes the spatial mismatch theory4 of urban poverty, arguing instead that the weak\nsocial networks that connect residents to job opportunities are a more significant cause of inner-\ncity unemployment.\n\n2Data for 2000 is from U.S. Bureau of the Census 2000. Other data is from Altshuler et al. 1999, Tables 3-2 and 3-3\non pp. 42-43.\n\n3 Altsculer et al. (1999) provide a good overview of government policies that contributed to these changes.\n4 The \"spatial mismatch\" concept was first suggested by researcher John Kain in 1968 to describe the disconnect\nbetween the location of workers and the location of jobs, as employment centers moved to the suburbs, leaving\ninner-city workers behind. There is a considerable body of research on the concept.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nThe emergence of shopping centers, first on large tracts of suburban land and then in\ndowntown festival marketplaces and malls, created strong competition and further eroded the\nmarket for neighborhood businesses. Larger retailers, such as department and grocery stores that\nanchored some neighborhood business districts, relocated to suburban centers. Other districts\ndominated by smaller \"mom and pop\" retail lost these businesses as well, when they closed in\nthe face of new competition or followed their customers to the suburbs (Mulkeen 1997; Rucker\n2001; Zielenbach 2000). Changes in transportation technology and the rise of the automobile as\nthe primary mode of transportation also contributed to rapid suburban growth while weakening\nneighborhood commercial districts tied to public transportation lines (Rucker 2001; Zielenbach\n2000). The civil unrest, arson, and growing crime that typically accompanied rapid demographic\nchange, disinvestment, and growing poverty also accelerated population and business loss\n(Bright 2000; Rucker 2001). In one Boston neighborhood, widespread arson and looting that\naccompanied a 1978 blizzard led to the closing of two dozen businesses (Mulkeen 1997).\nRevitalization Opportunities and Obstacles\nSuccessful revitalization approaches need to capitalize on the opportunities presented in\ninner-city neighborhoods while addressing long-standing obstacles to their rebirth. This section\nsummarizes research on both the special opportunities present in these neighborhoods and the\nbarriers to becoming healthy centers of community commerce. Because an important\nconsideration in assessing the Main Street approach's potential contribution to neighborhood\nrevitalization is how well it addresses these opportunities and obstacles, this discussion provides\nan important context for that analysis.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nOpportunities\nDespite the long period of population loss and disinvestment, urban neighborhoods have\nassets and positive trends that can fuel revitalization efforts. Michael Porter has applied the lens\nof competitive advantages to inner cities and emphasized the importance of crafting development\nstrategies and fostering private businesses that build on these advantages (Porter 1995, 1997).\nPorter identifies four key competitive advantages present in inner cities (1995):\n1. Strategic location close to the city center, key transportation infrastructure, and entertainment\nand tourist centers\n2. Local market demand reflected in high density that compensates for lower incomes, and\nspecialized urban ethnic market niches\n3. Integration with regional clusters,5 which creates an opportunity for inner-city businesses to\nprovide goods and services for these engines of regional economic growth\n4. Human resources that include a supply of moderate-wage hard-working and dedicated\nemployees and an entrepreneurial spirit in inner-city communities\n\nSeveral studies have documented the large inner-city consumer market and its potential to\nexpand retail business. A 1999 U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\nstudy estimated retail purchasing power within inner neighborhoods of 539 central cities at $331\nbillion, or one-third of the total central-city purchasing power. The report identified 48 inner\ncities where local purchasing power exceeded retail sales, creating a total sales gap of $8.7\nbillion. Large gaps, ranging from $379 to $658 million, were found in the Watts section of Los\nAngeles; Washington, D.C.; Detroit; and Newark, N.J. With higher population density, the\nincome and retail demand per square mile are greater for inner-city neighborhoods than for other\nareas. Consumer expenditures in low-income central-city areas are $33,500 per residential square\nmile, versus $25,900 in other parts of central cities, and exceeds by several times spending in\nother parts of the metropolitan areas (HUD 1999).\n\n5 Porter (1995) defines regional clusters as \"unique-to-a-region collections of related companies that are competitive\nnationally and globally.\"\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nInner-city communities have the added advantage of concentrated market segments and\nunique preferences that can support new or existing business. These segments include large\nblack, Hispanic, and youth markets, and specialized ethnic markets supported by immigrant\npopulations. The Initiative for a Competitive Inner City (ICIC), in its 1999 survey of 1,159\nhouseholds in 417 inner-city ZIP code areas, found several spending characteristics that make\ninner cities strong markets for several retail niches. Inner-city households spend more on apparel\nand groceries than the average U.S. household, and inner-city Latinos spend more on major\nproducts than other inner-city residents. Black and Hispanic inner-city shoppers show a stronger\ninterest in both shopping and the latest fashion trends (ICIC and PriceWaterhouseCoopers\n[PWC] 2000). Both the HUD and ICIC studies cite several retail chains that have successfully\nexpanded their inner-city stores, in many cases realizing very large sales per square foot at these\nlocations (HUD 1999; ICIC and PWC 2000). Scholars of immigrant entrepreneurship cite\nspecialized ethnic markets as a resource that supports small business ownership, helping\nimmigrants overcome employment barriers (Bates 1997b); Waldinger, Aldrich, and Ward 1990).\nHowever, Bates (1997b) argues that successful Asian entrepreneurs do not limit their businesses\nto serving co-ethnic markets.\nIn addition to generating market demand, expanded immigration to central-city\nneighborhoods stimulates business activity and investment. Grogan and Proscio (2000) cite\nexpanded immigration as a key positive trend supporting the rebirth of low-income city\nneighborhoods. Other studies have pointed to how ethnic enclaves and ethnic entrepreneurs can\nfuel economic growth (Portes and Stepick 1994; Waldinger, Aldrich, and Ward 1990). Ethnic\nbusinesses also can help to create a unique identity and destination that draws people from\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\noutside the neighborhood to shop and help ethnic entrepreneurs expand beyond their limited co-\nethnic market, which is critical to their growth potential (Waldinger, Aldrich, and Ward 1990).\n\nThe existing building stock, especially historic buildings, can help stimulate new\ninvestment and business activity. Historic buildings can attract residents and investors interested\nin architectural and historic preservation while contributing to a unique character and\nattractiveness of neighborhood commercial districts. Historic buildings were a key asset in\nattracting new residents and investment to neighborhoods in New Orleans and Pittsburgh (Moe\nand Wilkie 1997). Beyond historic buildings, the heritage and cultural activities that are unique\nto a neighborhood also can attract visitors, businesses, and investment to an area6 (Dane 1988,\n1997).\nHowever, given the relative cost of locating in the inner city, there are mixed views on\nwhether its building stock truly provides an advantage. Although inner-city neighborhoods have\na supply of vacant and underutilized real estate with lower land costs and building rental rates\nthan downtown and suburban areas, the condition of this real estate and the high costs associated\nwith its reuse can be a significant obstacle to new investment (Ferguson, Miller, and Liston\n1996;Porter 1997). In contrast, Main Street program sponsors have found it less expensive and\nmore feasible to rehabilitate existing building stock than to build new (Rucker 2001).\n\nAfter several decades of community development work, supported by government,\nfoundations, and the corporate community, many neighborhoods have increased their local\ncapacity to undertake development projects and other revitalization activities (Grogan and\nProscio 2000; Wright 1999). The growth of community development corporations (CDCs) is one\nmanifestation of this local capacity. The number of CDCs grew from 200 in 1970 to more than\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\n2,500 in 1999, and they were responsible for over one-third of the new affordable housing stock\nconstructed through 1996 (Wright 1999). Moreover, CDCs are expanding their activities beyond\naffordable housing development into many additional areas, including two areas directly related\nto commercial district improvement: commercial real estate development and business\ndevelopment (Stoutland 1999; Walker and Weinheimer 1998). Capacity also is found in resident\norganizations, other nonprofit organizations, religious congregations, and in the existing business\ncommunity. In many cities, neighborhood-based organizations receive critical financial and\norganizational support from private foundations, government, and the business community\n(Keyes et al. 1996; Walker and Weinheimer 1998).\nAlthough there is a legacy of federal policies that contributed to suburban growth and\nurban disinvestment, several federal policies now are helping to stimulate urban reinvestment by\nreducing barriers and expanding incentives for such investment. They include the Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA), the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, Community Development\nBlock Grants, and expanded incentives and regulatory flexibility for reuse of contaminated\nbrownfield sites (Orlebeke 1997; Wright 2001). These policies helped to change the perceptions\nand incentives for private investment in inner-city neighborhoods, and facilitated greater\ncollaboration among public agencies, community organizations, and the private sector to rebuild\nneighborhoods. For example, CRA requirements prompted recognition that a banking market\nexists in urban neighborhoods, overcoming bank resistance to lending in these areas (Orlebeke\n1997). Alex Schwartz (1998), in a study of CRA agreements in four cities, documented how\nworking relationships shifted from advocacy to regular communication and problem solving as\nboth parties -- lenders and CBOs -- worked to implement CRA agreements.\n\n6 Several neighborhood Main Street programs have utilized cultural and historic assets as part of their revitalization.\nExamples include San Antonio and Pittsburgh, described in Dane (1997),and Albuquerque, described in Dane\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nAlthough high crime rates and the perception of crime have been problems in many\ninner-city communities, this condition was reversed during the 1990s. Reduced crime rates are a\npositive trend that removes an important obstacle to attracting new residential and commercial\ninvestment while also improving the perception and image of inner-city neighborhoods. Grogan\nand Proscio (2000) cite reduced crime as one of four key factors that contributed to the rebirth of\nurban neighborhoods.\nObstacles\nAlthough urban neighborhoods are benefiting from several positive trends and have\nimportant assets, many obstacles to developing vital commercial districts remain. They include:\n1) decaying physical conditions; 2) poor customer and investor perceptions; 3) difficulties in\ncoordinating the actions of property owners, businesses, and local government; 4) a costly and\ncomplex business environment; 5) the often low capacity and marginal quality of businesses\nserving these districts; and 6) limited access to capital.\n\nSeveral physical factors deter economic activity in inner-city business districts. First,\nexisting buildings and land sites often are in poor condition and are not well-suited to business\nneeds. Land sites often are too small to accommodate the larger store formats increasingly used\nby chain retailers (Ferguson, Miller, and Liston 1996). Even if there is sufficient vacant land to\nsupport a new supermarket, retail center, office building, or mixed-use project, land may be in\nfragmented ownership, which requires assembling many sites and navigating a difficult public\ndisposition process.7 Land sites often require costly clean-up and building demolition to be\nusable -- costs that are not often faced in undeveloped suburban sites (Ferguson, Miller, and\n\n(1988).\n7For example, New Community Corporation had to assemble 62 individual lots to develop a supermarket in Newark,\nN.J. (Food Marketing Institute 1993). Note: Fannie Mae Foundation style requires page numbers only for direct\nquotes.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nListon 1996; Porter 1995; Suchman 1994). Existing buildings may be too small for many\nbusiness uses and often are in poor condition. Substantial investment is needed to make the\nbuildings suitable to attract new businesses. Market rents in inner-city neighborhoods, however,\nfrequently are too low to provide a return on the necessary investment. Consequently, many\nbuildings remain vacant, underutilized, or dedicated to uses that require minimal investment,\nsuch as warehousing.\nPublic infrastructure also may be poorly maintained, especially if property owners and\nlocal governments are fiscally strapped. Vacant sites; underutilized buildings; and buildings,\nstreets, sidewalks, and other public spaces in poor condition create an unattractive area for\nshopping, community activities, conducting business, and investment. Moreover, some research\nindicates that the sense of disorder fostered by poor physical conditions attracts criminal activity\n(Moore 1999; Grogan and Proscio 2000).\nFinally, some studies cite the lack of parking in urban neighborhoods as an obstacle to\nnew investment and shopping as people become increasingly dependent on cars (Dane 1988;\nSuchman 1994). Limited parking also may discourage businesses from locating in neighborhood\ncommercial districts if they believe that a large supply of parking is critical to their business.\n\nIn addition to the physical conditions described above, the persistent belief that limited\nmarkets and high crime exist in the inner city is a significant obstacle to new commercial activity\n(Ferguson, Miller, and Liston 1996; Porter 1997). Although some perceptions are rooted in real\nconditions, others inaccurately reflect the improved conditions in many city neighborhoods over\nthe past decade. False perceptions prevent businesses from recognizing and acting upon the\nmarket and business opportunities that do exist.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nAnother important obstacle to improving commercial districts is the difficulty of\ncoordinating the actions of the many property owners, merchants, government agencies, and\nnonprofit organizations whose collective actions shape a district's economic, social, and physical\nenvironment. For example, if a district wants to expand customer shopping by increasing its\nweekend or night hours, it must convince many merchants to do so. To keep the area clean, it\nmust get merchants, property owners, and the city sanitation department to work together as well\nas make residents more attuned to cleanliness. Furthermore, uncertainty about how others will\nact can inhibit behavior changes or new investment by businesses and property owners (Mulkeen\n1997). A property owner may not see any benefits in increased rents or occupancy from new\ninvestments if other property owners do not improve their premises as well (Mulkeen 1997).\nThe difficulty of coordinating action in urban business districts is contrasted with the\nmanagement of shopping malls, where common ownership and lease provisions ensure common\nstore hours, a well-maintained environment, and collective contribution to funding advertising,\nevents, and promotions (Houston 1997; Mitchell 2001; Waxman 1998). The need for coordinated\nactions among community stakeholders to make a commercial district competitive with suburban\nshopping centers is a major premise of the Main Street approach (Rucker 2001).\nInner-city locations also may have higher costs and more heavily regulated business\nenvironments than suburban locations (Porter 1995). Higher operating costs can arise from\nhigher city tax, utility, and insurance rates; the need for more private security; and other factors.\nDevelopment and construction costs usually are higher for inner-city sites due to extensive\ndevelopment regulations, the time and expense of securing support from community groups,\nhigher construction costs attributable to unionization, the logistics of building in a busy and\ndense urban environment, and site assembly and clean-up costs.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nThe capacity and management skills of small businesses that dominate neighborhood\nbusiness districts affect their stability and customer appeal. Poorly managed businesses are more\nlikely to fail, contributing to vacancies and high turnover. Levels of financial and human capital\nare key predictors of small business success (Bates 1997b), but immigrants and low-income\nentrepreneurs are disadvantaged in the levels of equity, education, and business experience that\nthey bring to their businesses, and thus experience higher failure rates (Bates 1997b). Moreover,\nsmall minority entrepreneurs often lack the knowledge, relationships, and access to suppliers\nneeded to offer the right merchandise mix to serve their customers, display goods in an appealing\nway, and successfully advertise their businesses (Rauch 1996). In addition, they are unable to\ntake advantage of the bulk inventories and purchasing power available to large retailers, which in\nturn makes their prices less competitive (DiPasquale and Wheaton 1996; Porter 1995). Without\nsound merchandising, inner-city businesses are likely to lose mobile customers to shopping\nmalls, larger retailers in surrounding suburbs, and downtown districts. Furthermore, because\nsmall business owners often work long hours, they typically have limited time to participate in\ncivic improvement and revitalization efforts (Mulkeen 1997).\nAlso, the limited mix of businesses in inner-city districts impairs their ability to draw a\nsubstantial local customer base. In the wake of business closures and disinvestment from the\n1960s through the 1980s, inner-city districts now in many cases are small niche and convenience\nretailers that draw a limited clientele. Without strong anchors, destination retailers, or an\nagglomeration of businesses, districts do not generate sufficient traffic to bring in new and\nstronger merchants that are needed to attract more customers and regenerate economic vitality.\nFinally, limited personal assets and barriers to accessing capital among small and\nminority entrepreneurs impede the success of firms in inner-city business districts (Gittell and\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nThompson 1999; Halpern 1996). Bates (1997b) analysis of the explanatory factors for the\nsuccess of minority-owned firms concludes that substantial owner investment and educational\nlevels are the strongest predictors of business success. Low- and moderate-income inner-city\nentrepreneurs have fewer personal assets to invest in their business and fewer networks capable\nof providing financial support, and thus are more likely to fail without alternative sources of\nequity capital (Gittell and Thompson 1999). Bates (1997b) also concludes that there is\nsubstantial evidence that financial barriers, including both limited personal wealth and access to\ncredit, limit black-owned business formation, growth, and survival.\nRevitalization Strategies\nMuch of the literature on the revitalization of low-income neighborhoods has been\nframed within two policy debates. One debate contrasts the benefits of place-based versus\npeople-based approaches to community development.8 A second debate concerns the viability of\nneighborhood versus regional economic development strategies.9\nIn the people versus place debate, critics of place-based development argue that strategies\nshould focus on improving the well-being of individuals and expanding their access to economic\nopportunity and residential choice. Nicholas Lemman (1994) strongly argued this case in a\nclassic article in the New York Times Magazine, in which he contended that inner-city\ncommunity development had failed. Lemann argued that inner cities have always attracted poor\n\n8 Two good summaries of people- versus placed-based strategies can be found in Zielenbach (2000, pp. 23-30) and\nSawicki and Moody (1999, pp. 76-80).\n9 See Waxman (1998, pp. 17-19) for a summary of this debate.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nresidents who find opportunity to improve their livelihood and then move to better\nneighborhoods.10\nCritics of place-based strategies argue that focusing on improving neighborhoods ignores\nthis cycle and is likely to fail because people with the means to leave poor neighborhoods will do\nso, re-creating the conditions that place-based efforts seek to address. Other supporters of the\npeople-based approach consider improving people's lives as the ultimate policy goal and fear\nthat place-based strategies may displace and not benefit poor residents (Bright 2000). Proponents\nof place-based strategies argue that improving living conditions in poor neighborhoods is a\nsound goal that improves the quality of life for residents even if individual poverty is not\neliminated (Grogan and Proscio 2000), and that a healthy neighborhood environment creates the\nconditions for individuals to successfully pursue broader economic activities (Waxman 2000).\nDickens (1999) disputes the people versus place debate altogether, arguing that social\nnorms and networks are the major obstacles to opportunity for inner-city residents. Without\nappropriate social norms and social networks that provide information on job opportunities,\nresidents will be unable to secure jobs wherever their location. Thus, Dickens argues, a\ncombination of people- and place-based efforts are needed to change the quantity and quality of\nsocial interactions and repair inner-city norms and networks. Sawicki and Moody (1999) also\npropose an alternative to a pure people versus place model, arguing for a people-based business\nstrategy that focuses on developing successful urban and suburban minority-owned businesses,\nwhich are more likely to hire low-income minorities wherever they live.\nThe second debate concerns the neighborhood as a viable geographic unit for economic\ndevelopment initiatives. Proponents of the regional economic development argue that because\n\n10 Some argue that this role of the inner city as the entry point in a process of upward mobility was interrupted with\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\neconomies operate on a regional scale, the locus for strengthening urban economic performance\nand access to economic opportunity is at the regional, not neighborhood, level. Because\nneighborhood economic activity is necessarily limited and economic growth is increasingly\ndispersed within metropolitan regions, improving the livelihood for low-income urban residents\nnecessitates expanding access to jobs throughout the region. (DiPasquale and Wheaton 1996,\nTietz 1989) Furthermore, economic development traditionally emphasized the base sectors of\nthe economy that compete in national and international markets and generate the jobs and\nincome that support local retail and service industries (Wiewel et. al 1989).11 Since\nneighborhoods are not usually centers for base industries and provide a limited area to grow\nthem, they are not considered an important focus for economic development.12 Advocates for\nneighborhood-based economic development, on the other hand, argue that a healthy\nneighborhood economy provides goods and services to improve residents' quality of life,\nbusiness ownership opportunities that increase local wealth and accessible entry-level jobs\n(Waxman 1998). Moreover, regional economic development does not automatically trickle\ndown to inner-city neighborhoods and their residents. After decades of disinvestment and\npoverty, these neighborhoods are unattractive to firms and their residents lack the education,\nnorms and connections needed to access jobs in the regional economy. Neighborhood-based\nservices and development efforts are needed to overcome investment and employment obstacles\nand ensure that urban neighborhoods gain the benefits of regional economic growth (Dickens\n1999, Halpern 1996).\n\nthe immigration freezes of the 1960s and 1970s, leaving neighborhoods without any replenishment as the upwardly\nmobile moved on, contributing to the neighborhood's decline (Ferguson 1999).\n11 This is a fundamental concept in regional economics (see Bendavid-Val 1994) but is also echoed in the\nprofessional economic development literature, for example Kane and Schwartz-Lloyd 1996.\n12 Metropolitan advocates make a related argument that inner city disinvestment and concentrated urban poverty is\ncaused by regional development patterns and that changes in regional governance and land-use policies are needed\nto address the problems of central cities. (Altshuler 1999, Bright 2000)\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nAn improved understanding of the relationship between neighborhood and regional\neconomies should inform revitalization strategies and help to bridge the neighborhood-regional\ndichotomy. Wiewel, Brown and Morris (1989) identified four mechanisms that link\nneighborhoods to regional economic development (market mechanisms, capitalist development,\nindustrial change, and political processes) but concluded that more research is needed to\nunderstand the ways in which these mechanisms work and interact. Tietz (1989) highlights three\nneighborhood roles in the regional economy: providing goods and services for export, producing\ngoods and services for neighborhood residents, and supplying labor. He considers the last\nfunction most important and the key determinant of neighborhood income, but also recognizes\nthat other factors, such as neighborhood assets and political mobilization, shape a\nneighborhood's economic outcomes. Porter connects inner-city to regional economic\ndevelopment through his notion of linkages to regional clusters. Neighborhoods can benefit\nfrom key regional industries by housing firms within these clusters, including supplier or support\nfirms (Porter 1997).\nStrategies to revitalize commercial districts implicitly accept the place-based\napproach that views a healthy commercial district as n important to improving the\nenvironment and quality of life for inner-city neighborhoods. Commercial district\nrevitalization, however, does not directly address the problems of inner-city poverty or\neconomic self-sufficiency. However, it can contribute to these goals by creating a\nstronger and more positive environment for residents, promoting more social interaction,\nand helping to change resident self-perceptions and norms. Moreover, a vital commercial\ndistrict generates new employment and business ownership opportunities, albeit at a\nsmaller scale than the regional economy. These neighborhood-based opportunities can\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nprovide a bridge to expanded job opportunities outside the neighborhood and to small\nbusiness ownership that provide alternatives to limited job opportunities in the labor\nmarket.\n\nOver the past 50 years, numerous policies, programs, and initiatives have been directed at\nimproving the well-being of inner-city neighborhoods. Although there are many ways to classify\nthese efforts, this report summarizes six primary intervention strategies aimed at revitalizing\nlow-income urban neighborhoods and their commercial districts:\n1. Comprehensive community initiatives (CCIs) attempt to simultaneously address multiple\nobstacles to revitalization. Examples of this approach include the Model Cities program of\nthe 1960s, several foundation initiatives in the early 1990s, and the federal Empowerment\nZone program.\n\n2. Enterprise zones use tax incentives and regulatory relief to attract new businesses and\ninvestment to a defined area with a goal to increase the employment of local residents.\n\n3. Housing-based strategies focus on rebuilding the residential base of a neighborhood as a\nprecondition for commercial district revitalization. Two key approaches are upgrading of\nhousing for the existing population and income groups, and attracting new higher income\ngroups to stimulate revitalization.\n\n4. Commercial real estate-based strategies emphasize physical improvements and real estate\nprojects as a means to attract businesses, create new consumer destinations, and remove\nvacant and blighted properties that contribute to crime and a poor image. Commercial\ndevelopment can include \"catalytic\" projects, which are large-scale or prominent projects\nthat can improve perceptions, leading to a sustained cycle of new private investment.\n\n5. Business development and attraction strategies focus on business investment and activity\nas the key engine for district revitalization. A wide variety of approaches exist that include\nbusiness attraction, financing and technical assistance to strengthen existing businesses, and\nmicroenterprise development.\n\n6. District management strategies seek to achieve greater coordination among business and\nproperty owners to help districts match the shared hours, appearance, promotions, and other\nadvantages enjoyed by shopping malls. A goal of these efforts is to improve a district's\nappeal and competitive position versus suburban shopping centers. Business improvement\ndistricts and the Main Street model are the major approaches based on this strategy.\n\nComprehensive Approaches\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nOne of the earliest comprehensive neighborhood revitalization approaches was the\nfederal Model Cities program introduced by the Johnson administration. Originally proposed as a\ndemonstration program to develop lessons to improve the program before its nationwide\nimplementation, Congress increased its size to include sites in 150 cities. Conflicts between city\ngovernments and neighborhood organizations, insufficient funding, and the program's\nelimination by the Nixon administration all limited its effectiveness (Kaplan 1995; Wright 2001).\nUnfortunately, little evaluation work was conducted, so the program's impact is not well\ndocumented (Wright 2001).\nA second wave of comprehensive community development efforts occurred in the early\n1990s through the efforts of several national foundations. These efforts were aimed at addressing\nthe multifaceted problems faced in poor inner-city neighborhoods by connecting improved\nindividual and family support services with housing and economic development initiatives. CCIs\nalso emphasized broad-based community planning and participation, local capacity building, and\ncreating strong collaboration among residents, multiple community-based organizations, and city\ngovernments (Wright 2001). Wright summarizes several CCIs, the issues associated with their\nevaluation, and evaluation results in his recent book on the Neighborhood Preservation Initiative\nsponsored by the Pew Foundation. Several studies found that CCI implementation often followed\ntraditional categorical programs and structures without achieving the desired integrated solutions\nand service delivery. Studies of CCIs cite various success factors, including: the need for\nbalanced development of both programmatic and organizational capacity; the importance of\nstrong leaders effective managers, and active resident leadership; and the need to build\nconsensus on both the nature of the problem and the proposed solutions (Wright 2001). The\nfederal Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community (EZ/EC) program enacted by Congress in\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\n1993 was based on a comprehensive revitalization model, although it used the enterprise zone\napproach discussed below. Federal designation was based on review of a strategic plan\ndeveloped with widespread community participation that identified a \"Strategic Vision for\nChange,\" addressed four national goals, and leveraged significant public and private resources to\nsupport implementation.\nA growing literature on this program includes two studies of initial implementation\n(Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government 1996, 1997), a five-year interim outcome\nevaluation (Hebert et al. 2001), and several individual city case studies (Keating and Krumholz\n1999). Key themes in this literature include significant community participation in strategic\nplanning and community representation on governance bodies (Hebert et al. 2001; Nelson A.\nRockefeller Institute of Government 1996), declining resident participation during the\nimplementation phase (Hebert et al. 2001), widespread implementation problems in establishing\nnew governance structures and sustaining strategy implementation with turnover in political and\nstaff leadership (Hebert et al. 2001; Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government 1996), and\nthe challenges in creating partnerships between government and community-based organizations\n(CBOs) and building CBO capacity to implement their expanded role in many EZ/EC plans\n(Hebert et al. 2001).\nThe most comprehensive evaluation to date was completed by Hebert et al. (2001), which\nincluded an in-depth analysis of six urban EZs13 and local analysis of program outcomes based\non local goals and strategies for the six EZs and 12 ECs. Despite the variation in local strategies,\nthe study found an almost ubiquitous emphasis on business development to expand jobs\nopportunities for zone residents and workforce development activities to prepare residents for\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\njobs and link them to employers. Expanding access to capital, and commercial development\nprojects, were the most common types of activities used to achieve business development goals,\nwhile workforce development focused on education and training services often linked to other\nsocial services. The study found that total employment grew in five of the six Ezs, and that job\ngrowth was higher during 1995 to 2000 than for the prior five-year period. Moreover, the\nemployment growth rate in four of the six EZs exceeded that of comparison areas during 1995 to\n2000, while those four EZs also saw a greater acceleration of job growth from 1990 to 1995 and\n1995 to 2000 than the comparison areas. Resident and minority-business ownership increased\nmarkedly during the five years, and those businesses were found to be statistically more likely to\nhire EZ residents than nonresident- or nonminority-owned firms.\nThe study authors identify several success factors and lessons learned, including: the\nimportance of a clear strategic vision for change that is effectively communicated to and shared\namong key stakeholders and implementers; the need for strong leadership by political leaders,\nEZ/EC staff, and community stakeholders; the importance of strong staff capacity; the critical\nrole played by technical assistance in business development efforts; and the finding that\ncollaborations between government, businesses, and CBOs, although difficult, were very\nvaluable in bringing \"different perspectives, networks, and resources to bear on solving the\nproblems being addressed\"(Hebert et al. 2001, 9-23).\n\nEnterprise Zones\nThis revitalization approach was launched in Britain under Prime Minister Margaret\nThatcher. The British program focused on removing regulatory hurdles and providing tax relief\n\n13 The study includes an analysis of Dun and Bradstreet data on business formation and employment growth for EZs\nand comparison areas, and two rounds of 300 business surveys at the baseline (1997) and the five-year outcome\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nand incentives to encourage new private investment and business activity in the most blighted\nand heavily vacant urban districts. When imported into the United States, the concept changed to\nemphasize revitalization and job creation in poor urban neighborhoods, often based on local\ninitiative rather than only on attracting outside investment (Butler 1990). The Reagan\nadministration proposed a federal enterprise zone program that was never enacted into law.\nAlthough the Clinton administration succeeded in enacting the EZ/EC program, it focused on\ncommunity empowerment and comprehensive strategies, along with investment and employment\ntax incentives. In its most recent incarnation, a new round of Empowerment Zones and Renewal\nCommunities designated in 2002 takes the program full circle, providing communities only tax\nand investment incentives.\nWhile awaiting a federal program, many states (38 as of 1996) implemented their own\nenterprise zone programs. Wilder and Rubin (1996) surveyed studies of state enterprise zone\nprograms to evaluate their impact on investment and employment. They reported that most\nstudies found increased job growth and investment following zone designation and that new\nstart-ups and existing business expansions, rather than relocations into the zone, accounted for\nthe vast majority of this growth. Results, however, were often mixed, with some zones and some\nurban areas in state programs having either little to no activity or a net loss in jobs. The authors\nconcluded that targeting development incentives alone is insufficient to revitalize areas\ndesignated as enterprise zones, and that the most effective state programs limit zones to a small\nnumber, select zones through a competitive process, and offer a wide variety of incentives. They\nalso found that zones with a stable economic base and a significant amount of available\ncommercial and industrial land are more likely to be successful. Finally, they argue for more\n\ndates (2000).\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nclearly defined job goals, stronger education and training linkages to match residents' skills to\nthe needs of zone businesses, and greater use of strategic planning.\nHousing-Based Strategies\nMost inner-city revitalization efforts have focused on housing, reflecting the need to\nrebuild the housing stock and residential base of neighborhoods that lost population and suffered\nwidespread housing abandonment and deterioration. The greater availability of federal and\nprivate-sector funding for residential development and greater local government and community-\nbased capacity in housing also have fostered a strong emphasis on housing-based revitalization\nstrategies. Housing development in low-income neighborhoods also is supported by a strong\nnetwork of national intermediaries, including the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation,\nLocal Initiatives Support Corporation, and the Enterprise Foundation, as well as by state housing\nfinance agencies (Wright 1999). Although housing strategies are not aimed directly at\ncommercial district revitalization, they provide a critical foundation for such efforts by\nexpanding the customer base for commercial districts (Grogan and Proscio 2000) and by\naddressing major sources of blight that repel consumers and discourage new business\ninvestment.\nSeveral authors divide housing revitalization strategies into two categories: upgrading\nthat seeks to improve housing conditions for existing residents, and gentrification, which seeks to\nattract new higher-income residents (Downs 1981; Zielenbach 2000). Because a primary goal of\nneighborhood revitalization is to improve conditions for existing residents (Bright 2000; Grogan\nand Proscio 2000), upgrading for existing residents is an important part of most housing\nstrategies. However, when the goals of revitalization include repopulating neighborhoods and\nreducing concentrated poverty, then some amount of gentrification, i.e., attracting higher income\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nresidents, is necessary. The risk of gentrification strategies is that existing low- and moderate-\nincome residents will be displaced as rents and property values increase with greater demand for\ninner-city housing stock. Moe and Wilkie (1997) emphasize the importance of attracting middle-\nclass residents to preserve and revitalize inner-city neighborhoods, and criticize policies that\navoid serving the urban middle class due to displacement fears but that ignore how neighborhood\ninstability and disinvestment generates displacement of low-income residents.\nSeveral authors point to the critical role that CDCs play in preserving and expanding\ninner-city housing. CDCs are credited with producing several hundred thousand housing units\n(Grogan and Proscio 2000), estimated to total 30 percent of the new annual affordable housing\nproduction (Wright 2001), and investing in projects and neighborhoods that private developers\ndo not serve (Stoutland 1999; Wright 2001). However, other observers point out that most CDCs\nare small and fragile organizations with limited impact (Halpern 1996). Stoutland (1999) reports\nthat 70 percent of all CDCs provide 25 or fewer units per year.\nLarge-scale housing development through major redevelopment projects is credited with\nrebuilding entire neighborhoods in New York, most notably the south Bronx (Grogan and\nProscio 2000; Orlebeke 1997). The components of New York's successful housing strategy\nincluded the availability of large tracts of city-owned land; a major investment of city funds;\nleveraging private-sector leadership and funding; relying on a mix of development organizations\nincluding CDCs, private developers, and other nonprofits; and leveraging of significant federal\nfunds (Grogan and Proscio 2000; Orlebeke 1997). The scale of New York's effort is impressive\n-- almost $1.4 billion in city and private funds was invested in the South Bronx alone to create\n10,000 new homes and apartments.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nRecognizing that many cities lack the resources for new housing development at such a\nlarge scale, Kromer (2000) provides an alternative strategy based on his experience as director of\nhousing in Philadelphia. He argues that cities can no longer afford to rebuild entire\nneighborhoods as practiced under urban renewal programs, but instead must build partnerships\nbetween city government, neighborhood organizations, and the private sector that invest funds\nbased on a neighborhood strategic plan. The strategic plan entails a series of projects and\nprograms to solve a neighborhood's housing abandonment and disinvestment problems. It is\nlikely to include programs to stimulate homeownership demand to preserve the existing stock\nand help existing homeowners repair their properties, strategic investments in housing\nrehabilitation, selective demolition and new housing development, and the provision of\nsupportive housing in neighborhoods to reduce homelessness.\nOne of Philadelphia's successes was stimulating neighborhood homeownership by\nfunding prehomeownership counseling and training services and providing a $1,000 subsidy to\nreduce settlement costs for home buyers, both delivered through local nonprofit organizations.\nThe program generated 10,000 home purchases by city residents in neighborhoods of their\nchoice. The result was increased racial mobility into more mixed neighborhoods and new\ninvestment in older houses in traditional working-class neighborhoods that had experienced\nmiddle-class out-migration in the 1950s and 1960s (Kromer 2000).\nExperience in other neighborhoods suggests that a strategic investment in a large catalytic\nhousing development, in combination with programs that support smaller-scale housing\nimprovement, can stimulate renewal. Revitalization of Chicago's South Shore neighborhood\nduring the 1980s was stimulated by the large 446-unit Parkways rehabilitation project\nencompassing 20 buildings, combined with efforts to upgrade small apartment buildings,\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nincrease homeownership, and develop new low-income housing through the efforts of South\nShore Bank (Fernandes 1997; Taub 1988). Similarly, the redevelopment of Sears' vacant former\nheadquarters complex into the mixed-use Homan Square development anchored by 600 new\nhousing units was a major catalyst for new investment and revitalization in Chicago's Lawndale\nneighborhood (Zielenbach 2000). The project's impact was reinforced by smaller-scale\nrehabilitation projects and by provision of health, youth, and education services by the Lawndale\nChristian Development Corporation (Giloth 1999)\nCommercial Real Estate-Based Strategies\nDowntown commercial development has been a major local revitalization strategy in\nmany cities. These efforts focus on repositioning central business districts to compete effectively\nwith the growing suburbs as both retail shopping centers and service-sector employment\n(Teaford 1990; Levine 1987). Tourism and entertainment-oriented development are also a\ngrowing focus of downtown development efforts. Downtown redevelopment efforts originally\nwere encouraged and supported with federal urban renewal dollars, and later with large federal\nUrban Development Action Grants, but the practice was increasingly refined and expanded upon\nthrough the experiences of cities working closely in partnerships with private developers\n(Frieden 1990). These efforts have included improving the infrastructure to support new large-\nscale private development; assembing land for large-scale projects; conducting planning and\ndesign work to create a vision; building momentum and defining the quality of projects; and\nproviding extensive financial support through tax incentives, direct project financing, and land\nwrite-downs. Although some observers view downtown development as one of the key positive\ntrends in urban development (Grogan and Proscio 2000; Kaplan 1995), others have criticized it\nfor failing to provide good-quality jobs for urban residents and providing few benefits to the\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nsurrounding low-income neighborhoods (Halpern 1996; Khan 2001; Krumholz 1996; Suchman\n1994).\nNeighborhood commercial development -- with a different character and a far smaller\nscale than downtown development efforts -- has focused primarily on addressing the widespread\ndisinvestment experienced by neighborhood shopping districts from the 1960s through the\n1980s. Retail development projects have been a major focus of these efforts through both\nrehabilitation of existing buildings and new construction. A second element in neighborhood\ncommercial development has been the redevelopment of major abandoned and blighted\nproperties, which as symbols of neighborhood decline, prevent new investment and can attract\ncriminal activity. Given the weak market conditions and smaller scale of neighborhood retail\nprojects, CDCs and other nonprofit organizations have been early developers of them. However,\nthere has been growing private-sector interest in inner-city retail development (Grogan and\nProscio 2000; Hernandez 2001; HUD 1999; ICIC and PWC 2000), and several researchers\nemphasize that sustained revitalization requires renewed investment by private businesses and\ndevelopers (Halpern 1996; Hernandez 2001; Porter 1997)\nSeveral commercial development efforts have focused on supermarket development,\ngiven the importance of providing this basic retail service in low-income communities.\nSupermarkets also serve as anchor tenants to attract a core of shoppers and other retail\ndevelopment (Ferguson, Miller, and Liston 1996; Grogan and Proscio 2000; Halpern 1996;\nWaxman 1998) and provide a large number of jobs, many of which can be targeted to local\nresidents. The Food Marketing Institute (1993) summarized Supermarket General's partnership\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nwith Newark's New Community Corporation (NCC) to develop a new Pathmark supermarket.14\nNCC served as the project's owner and developer -- assembling land, gaining community and\ngovernment support, attracting needed subsidies and financing, and screening local residents for\nemployment. Pathmark designed and operated the supermarket, adapted its merchandising to\nlocal preferences, and made a commitment to hire local residents. Store sales exceeded\nprojections after it opened in July 1990, and more than half of its employee hires were from\nNewark.\nHernandez (2001) studied a new Stop and Shop supermarket in Boston's Hyde/Jackson\nSquare neighborhood that was a joint project of a private developer and a CDC. He found that\nthe project attracted new shoppers in the area, raised rents and property values, doubled the\nneighborhood job base, and contributed to increased business sales. An important element of the\nproject was the redevelopment of a contaminated former manufacturing plant that had become a\ncenter of blight and crime. The developer financed a $500,000 neighborhood fund to support\ncommunity programs and assist owners of small convenience stores who feared that the\nsupermarket would negatively impact their businesses. The CDC also provided technical\nassistance to help the small stores adapt to the supermarket. Hernandez found mixed outcomes\namong the small convenience stores, with half experiencing lower sales after the supermarket\nopened. However, one large independent grocery store achieved sales growth by repositioning\nitself to cater to Hispanic residents. The CDC partner played a critical role by facilitating\ncommunity input into the project, securing development subsidies, and establishing a\nneighborhood job referral network for the supermarket. Neighborhood residents secured 60\npercent of the supermarket's 200 jobs (Hernandez 2001).\n\n14 This project followed an earlier partnership between Pathmark and the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration\nCorporation in Brooklyn, discussed by Grogan and Proscio (2000) and referenced in the Food Marketing Institute\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nSupermarkets are not the only uses that support new commercial development. Several\nauthors have discussed successful retail development built around other national retail chains,\nincluding drug stores such as Rite Aid and Walgreens and apparel stores such as Payless and\nFootlocker Ferguson, Miller, and Liston 1996; Grogan and Proscio 2000; Wright 1999).\nMulkeen (1997) documented how nonprofit organizations, as both developers and tenants,\ncontributed to revitalization of the Codman Square neighborhood, while commercial\ndevelopment projects with a mix of retailers supported the rebirth of Boston's Egleston Square\ncommercial district (Grogan and Proscio 2000; Hernandez 2001). In both Codman Square and\nEgleston Square, the impact of commercial development was due not only to the attraction of\nnew retailers. Redevelopment and reuse of severely blighted properties that affected the\nneighborhood's image and public safety were cited as important generators of revitalization\n(Hernandez 2001; Mt.Auburn Associates 2002; Mulkeen 1997).\nA recent study of four Boston neighborhoods (Mt. Auburn Associates 2002) found that\nCDC-sponsored commercial real estate projects were one of several factors that contributed to\nbusiness district turnarounds, along with increased population, reduced crime, and other\nnonprofit and city revitalization projects. In each neighborhood, these projects were broadly\nperceived by local businesses as both improving the district and their own businesses, removing\nsignificant blight and enhancing the district's image, and complementing, rather than competing\nwith, the existing retail base. However, the several statistical trends in these four neighborhoods\nwere similar to those in a control group of 10 neighborhoods without CDC-sponsored\ncommercial development projects.\nOther studies point to the difficulties and mixed success of neighborhood commercial\ndevelopment. Taub (1988) discusses the limited success of South Shore bank's efforts to\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\nreport.\n\nrevitalize the 71st Street corridor during the 1970s and 1980s. Zielenbach (2000) summarizes\nfailed attempts to redevelop Chicago's Englewood commercial district after the departure of\nmajor retail anchors in the mid-1970s. Although a number of political factors and bad timing\nprevented planned redevelopment projects from being implemented, Zielenbach concludes that\nthe lack of commitment and involvement by a range of institutions in the neighborhood was a\ncritical cause of Englewood's failed attempts at revitalization. Giloth's (1999) history of\nrevitalization efforts in Chicago's North Lawndale emphasizes that a diverse mix of smaller-\nscale faith-based and private-sector development projects, in conjunction with community-\nbuilding efforts, proved more successful than comprehensive large scale redevelopment plans.\nThe EZ/EC interim outcome report (Hebert et al. 2001) indicates that site assembly, local\nregulations, and the complexity of assembling, financing, and managing construction slowed the\ncompletion of planned development projects in most communities, leaving most projects\nuncompleted at the five-year evaluation date. Two interesting initiatives cited in the report\ninclude Atlanta's effort to use grants and loans to attract private developers to redevelop\nabandoned commercial strips and shopping centers along four commercial corridors, and\nBoston's targeting of funds to complete four building reuse projects in the Dudley Square\ncommercial district. This latter effort included work to generate a sufficient scale of new\ninvestment to change the investment climate and fill a large inventory of vacant upper-story\noffice space, and creating a shared debt service reserve that allowed projects to proceed into\ndevelopment without all being preleased.\nSeveral conclusions emerge from this largely case study-based literature on commercial\ndevelopment. Although traditional economic development and downtown development efforts\nfocus on large-scale catalytic projects, no one type of development project, defined by either use\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nor scale, is essential for neighborhood commercial district revitalization. Success stories include\nboth larger catalytic projects and sets of smaller incremental projects. Similarly, a range of retail,\nservice, and nonprofit uses provided the economic basis for new development. Second,\nrevitalization impacts are due to a combination of physical improvements that eliminate blight\nand change the commercial district image and the attraction of new businesses and economic\nuses. This finding reinforces the Main Street approach's dual emphasis on design improvements\nand economic restructuring. Finally, commercial development has relied on partnerships and\ncomplementary investments among the nonprofit sector, private businesses, private developers,\nfaith-based organizations, and government.\nBusiness Development and Attraction Strategies\nBecause neighborhood commercial districts often are dominated by small independent\nbusinesses (Symons, LoBue, and Wood 1998; Taub 1998), many neighborhood economic\ndevelopment efforts focus on supporting the start-up and growth of small locally owned\nbusinesses. They face strong competition and considerable obstacles to success, and lack the\nfinancial, management, and marketing sophistication of larger businesses (Bendicks and Egan,\n1991; Gittell and Thompson 1999; Mulkeen 1997; Rauch 1996;). By increasing small\nbusinesses' capacity and reducing obstacles to their success, small business development can\nstrengthen commercial districts by reducing the failure and turnover of businesses, on the one\nhand, and attracting a larger and more stable customer base, on the other. A second argument for\nsmall business development is that research indicates that residents and minority-owned\nbusinesses are more likely to hire inner-city residents than other firms (Gittell and Thompson\n1999; Hebert et al. 2001; Sawicki and Moody 1999). Small business development strategies\nusually entail providing management and technical assistance services to small businesses and\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nexpanding access to capital through either direct lending programs or loan packaging assistance.\nOther efforts have sought to attract new businesses to neighborhoods and to link small businesses\nto larger business opportunities outside the neighborhoods. Finally, there has been a large growth\nin microdevelopment efforts that help women, low-income persons, and others start their own\nbusinesses.\nBusiness development has a long history in inner-city neighborhood revitalization --\nmany of the early CDCs concentrated on economic development (Stoutland 1999). Early CDCs'\nbusiness development efforts included the direct creation, ownership, and management of\nbusiness enterprises and business financing, but later generations of CDCs have moved away\nfrom direct business creation to providing capital and technical assistance (Stoutland 1999). A\n1992 survey of CDCs identified 130 involved in business development, with business technical\nassistance the most common activity (Wong 2001). More recently, there has been a trend toward\nthe creation of neighborhood-based business development networks among CDCs and other\nnonprofit organizations. Several of these networks focus on job creation for low-income\nneighborhood residents through supporting the retention and growth of local firms, often\nmanufacturers (Rist and Sahay 1996). Other networks assist neighborhood service and retail\nfirms to strengthen commercial districts and meet resident needs rather than helping\nmanufacturers to retain and expand local jobs .\nIn New York City, a network of Business Outreach Centers (BOCs) has been formed\namong different community organizations in eight low-income neighborhoods.15 BOCs operate\nas brokers, connecting local entrepreneurs to a diverse range of professional, technical\nassistance, and financial services. Each BOC identifies and formalizes relationships with a\nnetwork of service providers, reaches out to local businesses, makes referrals to appropriate\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nservice providers, and then monitors the quality of services (Harrison and Weiss 1998; Wong\n2001). A case study reported that the eight BOCs served 1,053 clients in 1994, made 1,400\nreferrals, helped create 162 new businesses, and assisted in the creation or retention of 257 jobs\n(Harrison and Weiss 1998). Half of the respondents to a survey indicated that their management\nskills improved due to BOC services.\nTen Boston CDCs cooperate through the Community Business Network (CBN) to\nprovide outreach, one-on-one technical assistance services, training, and assistance in securing\nloans to neighborhood businesses. A 1999 evaluation found that CBN had helped 20 to 30\nentrepreneurs start their business; generated sales, productivity, or job growth in more than half\nof the existing businesses served; and led to the creation of 250 to 300 jobs, largely for minorities\nand neighborhood residents (Seidman 1999). More than half of the CBN-assisted businesses\nsurveyed in the study also reported making an investment that contributed to a neighborhood's\nphysical revitalization, such as improving their building or reusing a vacant building or site.\nAlthough most CBN members did not focus exclusively on neighborhood commercial districts,\nsome members did concentrate on these districts and worked to link their efforts with\nneighborhood Main Street programs.\n\nEmpowerment Zone and Enterprise Community strategies also widely used business\ndevelopment and finance programs in their revitalization strategies. Sixteen of the 18 sites in the\ninterim outcomes study (Hebert et al. 2001) had programs to expand access to capital for\nneighborhood businesses, most often by creating a U.S. Small Business Administration Business\ninformation, technical assistance and financing center (also known as one-stop capital shops ) to\nprovide a range of education and technical assistance services and by providing credit to small\nbusinesses. Several communities had difficulty generating sufficient demand for their loan funds,\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n15 Seven centers are in New York City neighborhoods, and one is in Bridgeport Conn.\n\nprimarily due to the inability of potential borrowers to qualify for loans. Other sites overcame\nthis problem with active marketing efforts and the provision of a full range of technical services\nto businesses. EZ/EC communities were also most successful in leveraging private sector capital\nthrough business loan funds.\nDistrict Management Strategies\nThe final strategy seeks to address the overall management of a business district to improve its\nability to compete with shopping malls in attracting shoppers, businesses, and investment.\nDistrict management strategies work to coordinate the actions of the many parties whose actions\nshape the overall quality of the business district environment and experience. Three broad district\nmanagement approaches16 have been used predominantly in downtown districts: business\nimprovement districts (BIDs), centralized retail management, and the Main Street program.\nBusiness Improvement Districts. BIDs are a legal mechanism through which private\nbusinesses and property owners tax themselves to fund services, projects, and activities to\nimprove a defined business district. BIDs are authorized by a state law that sets out the specific\nprocess and requirements for creating a BID along with their funding mechanisms and powers.\nTypically, creation of BIDs are initiated by private parties and then require the approval of at\nleast a majority of local property owners and by the local government. Once a BID is established,\nthe local government collects an additional fee, tax, or assessment on behalf of the BID to\nprovide its core funding. The BID's specific activities are defined locally, usually as the result of\na planning process involving downtown property owners, businesses, and institutions, and\nnegotiations with local governments (Houston 1997; Mitchell 2001).\n\n16 Business associations, such as chambers of commerce and boards of trade, arguably constitute another district\nmanagement approach, but they are limited to one stakeholder group and usually pursue a limited set of activities\naround marketing and promotion (Waxman 1998) .\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nMitchell (2001) identified more than 400 BIDs in the United States, encompassing 43\nstates and almost all of the largest cities. Based a survey of 264 BIDs, Mitchell found that\nconsumer marketing was the most common activity, followed by maintenance (cleaning, graffiti,\nand snow removal, etc.), policy advocacy and capital improvement projects. BID services varied\nby city size -- BIDs in larger cities provided the broadest range of services and were more likely\nto be involved in public safety ,while small-city BIDs focused primarily on consumer marketing\nand maintenance efforts.\nHouston (1997) provides a more detailed discussion of how BIDs are organized, funded,\nand structured, and the type of activities they pursue, including case studies and examples from\nnumerous BIDs. Ryan's (2000) analysis of the Center City BID in Philadelphia emphasizes the\nBID's orientation toward attracting suburban shoppers by creating a safer and more easily\nnavigated environment, conducting direct marketing, and making physical improvements. Ryan\nobserved that the BID has taken on a role in planning and large-scale physical improvement\nprojects -- activities that once were the exclusive responsibility of city government.\nAlthough BIDs offer advantages over other forms of business district management, they\nprovide no defined strategy for achieving revitalization. Key advantages of BIDs include their\nstable funding base and the mandatory financial participation of all property owners. The\npredictable funding base allows BIDs to have more staff and take on more activities than typical\nMain Street program districts. The BID structure may also foster greater private-sector\ninvolvement and \"ownership\" of BID efforts because property owners and businesses directly\nfund their work. However, this financial advantage may be less applicable in low- and moderate-\nincome neighborhoods where businesses and property owners may have fewer resources and be\nmore resistant to taxing themselves, compared with relatively affluent business areas. Another\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nadvantage of BIDs is that they are formed in conjunction with, and have strong connections to,\nlocal government, which helps mobilize government support and investment in BID projects\n(Ryan 2000).\nTwo disadvantages of BIDs are the long time needed to organize one17 and the absence of\nmechanisms for participation by other stakeholders, most notably residents. Although this may\nnot be a major issue in downtowns largely populated with businesses, it is a problem for\nneighborhood districts. Finally, BIDs offer only an organizational form for revitalization, with no\nexplicit theory about how to achieve it. Although this allows each BID to assess its own needs\nand formulate a unique agenda, it provides a limited guide to practice.\n\nCentralized Retail Management. Centralized Retail Management (CRM) is a second\napproach to district management, but its use has been limited. CRM involves formal contractual\narrangements among property owners to jointly fund and undertake activities through a central\nretail management organization, implement common property covenants (governing such things\nas the cleanliness and quality of storefronts and signs), and coordinate retail leasing. The scope\nof CRM, which attempts to achieve common store practices and coordinated retail mixes, most\nclosely approximates the nature of a retail mall (Stokvis and Cloar 1991; Waxman 1998).\nIn practice, CRM has been extremely difficult to implement. A review of CRM use in\nfour communities (Stokvis and Cloar 1991) revealed a number of pitfalls, including property\nowners' resistance to sharing information and coordinating action in leasing, resistance to\ncovenants that encumber properties and tenants, and difficulty gaining broad participation and\nbalanced representation among stakeholders, especially retailers. Waxman (1998) reports that\nCRM has been used rarely, and quotes a leading downtown consultant who states that CRM is\n\"by and large an ignominious failure\" (p. 58).\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nThe Main Street Program. The Main Street program -- the most widely used approach to\nbusiness district management18 -- was developed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation\nin the late 1970s based on its work in three midwestern towns. It has been used primarily in\ntowns and small cities. The Main Street strategy uses a four-point approach to business district\nrevitalization. The first point -- organization -- is often cited as the most important (Dane\n1988).It emphasizes building a broad-based volunteer organization to undertake revitalization\nbased on consensus and cooperation among the many stakeholders in the business district. The\nother three points address programmatic aspects of district management: 1) design, which\nfocuses on improving the district's physical environment (storefronts and signs, buildings\n[renovation and development], public infrastructure, and maintenance); 2) promotion, which is\nused to market the district and improve its image to customers, new businesses, investors, and\nvisitors; and 3) economic restructuring, which seeks to enhance the district economy by helping\nexisting business expand and attracting new ones (Dane 1997).\nWith this broad framework, the Main Street program presents itself as a comprehensive\nstrategic framework that can be tailored to unique local conditions and needs. In Main Street\nSuccess Stories, Dane (1997) describes a very diverse set communities that have implemented\nMain Street programs, ranging from small rural towns to suburban communities to mid-sized\ncities to urban neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and San Antonio. The Main Street framework can\nextend more broadly than district management approaches, such as those employed by BIDs, to\nencompass other commercial revitalization strategies, including housing development,\ncommercial development, and business development.\n\n17The average period nationally in 1.5 years while in New York it is 30 months (Waxman)\n18 The National Main Street Center Web site (www.MainStreet.org) states that the Main Street approach has been\nused in more than 1,600 communities.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nRucker (2001) compared the Main Street theory with conventional economic and\ncommunity development theories, and considered how well the Main Street theory fits the issues\nfaced in urban areas. She concluded that the Main Street approach fails to address several\nimportant urban problems, including crime, homelessness, the language and cultural barriers\nfaced by minority groups, and gentrification. Moreover, Rucker noted, traditional Main Street\ngoals focus on historic preservation, maintaining community character, and improving local\nquality of life, but do not address job creation and social equity that are important in urban low-\nincome communities. Finally, she identified urban environmental factors that may pose obstacles\nto using the Main Street approach in urban areas, or require them to use alternate approaches,\ncompared with non-urban areas.The factors include greater cynicism based on past failures, more\ncompetition for resources among many local organizations, market competition from other city\ncommercial districts, and an emphasis on larger-scale catalyst projects.\nDuring the 1980s, the National Main Street Center undertook a demonstration program to\ntest the Main Street approach in seven urban downtown and neighborhood commercial districts.\nA report by Dane (1988) provides a detailed description of how each district implemented the\nMain Street program and highlights differences between downtown (central business district, or\nCBD) and neighborhood business district (NBD) programs. Overall, NBDs began with less pre-\nexisting capacity and faced greater implementation obstacles than CBD programs. With a more\ncomplex mix of local stakeholder organizations and the need to include residents, neighborhood\nMain Street programs took longer to organize and faced more competition for support and\nfunding. They also needed to spend more time conducting outreach and communication to build\nsupport and to overcome concerns that the program would lead to gentrification. Although CBD\nprograms had pre-existing promotional efforts to build on, NBDs had to start from scratch in\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\ncreating a base on promotion efforts. Neighborhood districts also had more difficulty defining a\nunique image and a marketing message for their district, and found it harder to attract media\nattention.\nOn the other hand, NBDs were very comfortable with the Main Street incremental\nimprovement approach, while CBDs were more interested in identifying one big project to\nrevitalize downtown. Neighborhood districts had two assets to support their promotion and\neconomic restructuring efforts: a stronger retail economy and adjacent market to draw on.\nEconomic restructuring in neighborhood districts had to address concerns over business\ndisplacement, which was accomplished by explaining to merchants and residents the causes of\nbusinesses closures (that often did result from the revitalization work). to allay fears, and by\nhelping existing businesses buy their buildings.\n\nDane drew a number of lessons from the Urban Demonstration Program. She found that\nMain Street programs can be implemented by either a new standalone organization or an existing\none. The mission and capacity of the candidate organizations, and how the political environment\naffected their ability to be viewed as a neutral organization, were the most critical considerations\nin whether a new or existing organization would work best.\nPromotional activities were important early in the process, with special events providing\na way to involve residents and draw people to the district for a positive experience that would\ncounter an image of decline. Successful design efforts typically began with small projects, such\nas sign or facade upgrades, but then progressed to building rehabilitations and improving public\nspaces. Finally, Dane found that economic restructuring was the hardest activity to implement\nbecause of the difficulty of recruiting volunteers with appropriate skills, and the need to\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\ncomplete data collection and analysis before defining activities. Consequently, most programs\ndid not begin implementing an economic restructuring agenda until their third year.\nAssessing the Main Street Model\nThis section concludes with an assessment of the applicability of the Main Street\nProgram to inner-city commercial revitalization. The first part of the discussion considers how\nwell the program theory and methods address the revitalization obstacles and opportunities\ndiscussed in the prior section. Second, the key differences between the Main Street approach and\nother strategies are discussed.\nThe Main Street framework is well suited to leveraging several inner-city opportunities\nand advantages. First, its focus on promotion and economic restructuring can leverage the large\ninner-city consumer market. These activities also can be adapted to leverage immigrant\nentrepreneurship, ethnic markets, and the multicultural character of many urban neighborhoods.\nSecond, the Main Street design, physical improvement, and historic preservation activities utilize\nthe existing building stock and focus attention on improving public spaces and infrastructure.\nFinally, by including and working with existing community-based organizations, Main Street\nprograms can focus the growing local capacity in inner-city neighborhoods toward creating and\nimplementing a shared vision for the commercial district.\nOn the other hand, the Main Street approach is not oriented to capitalize on other inner-\ncity opportunities. It is not concerned with education and workforce development efforts that tap\ninto neighborhood human resources to attract firms and link residents to regional job\nopportunities. Similarly, its economic focus is primarily on the local retail market rather than on\nconnecting the urban neighborhoods and businesses to the regional economy and growth-\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\noriented industry clusters.19 Thus, its activities are unlikely to capitalize on the logistical\nadvantages of inner-city locations cited by Porter (1997). Finally, because Main Street programs\nconcentrate on soft activities and retailing, they are not well positioned to directly leverage\nfederal programs and other funding sources that are geared to housing, real estate development,\nand credit availability.\nThe Main Street framework is well aligned to address most of the revitalization obstacles\nidentified by researchers. Its design component addresses decaying physical conditions in urban\nneighborhood, although inner-city districts are likely to require larger-scale interventions than\nthose addressed by the traditional Main Street incremental approach.20 Furthermore, the Main\nStreet strategy's strong bias toward historic preservation may overlook or de-emphasize the need\nfor new construction and redevelopment projects. Promotion and marketing activities, along with\nphysical improvements, are oriented toward overcoming poor customer and investor perceptions.\nEconomic restructuring committees provide services that improve the capacity and quality of\nlocal businesses and help them overcome regulatory barriers. Finally, Main Street programs are\nexplicitly oriented toward coordinating the actions of property owners, businesses, and local\ngovernments to create a more competitive and attractive commercial district.\nThere are, however, several important revitalization obstacles that are not directly\naddressed in the Main Street model. First, neither the Main Street framework nor its practice\naddresses public safety as an obstacle to a vital business district -- a major omission for inner-\ncity neighborhoods with real and perceived crime problems. Second, the Main Street approach\ndoes not focus on the problem of weak social norms, role models, and social networks that some\n\n19 One exception to this observation is the traditional Main Street focus on attracting tourists, which may be relevant\nto some urban neighborhoods. For example, tourism has been an important part of the Harlem Empowerment Zone\nstrategy.\n20 This observation was also made by Rucker (2001).\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nobservers believe contribute to economic isolation and poverty in inner-city neighborhoods.\nFinally, although Main Street activities do tackle inner-city disinvestment in some ways,21 the\nframework does not emphasize expanding capital availability for businesses, residents, and\nproperty owners.\n\nThe Main Street model differs from other strategies in its comprehensive focus on the\nissues confronting commercial districts, emphasis on cumulative incremental change, and heavy\nreliance on volunteer efforts and local private funding. It also offers practitioners a well-\ndeveloped professional network and information base, through the National Main Street Center,\nto support their work. Commercial development and district management strategies concentrate\non commercial districts -- the former focuses on building the real estate to support economic\nactivities, while other district management approaches emphasize the coordination mechanisms\nover their content. The Main Street strategy takes a broader view of what is needed for a healthy\nbusiness district, and emphasizes the importance of attracting the shoppers along with businesses\nand investment. This is especially important for retail-based districts, which need to attract\ncustomers to be viable. Although the Main Street approach is not comprehensive in the\ncommunity development context because it does not address many of the social, housing, and\nemployment issues facing low-income communities, it is based on a more complete theory of\nbusiness district revitalization than other strategies.\nMain Street's focus on small-scale incremental change also differentiates it from most\nother strategies, especially comprehensive community development initiatives, enterprise zones,\nand commercial development strategies, all of which emphasize large-scale activities, projects,\nand impacts. The incremental approach requires fewer resources and less capacity to get started,\n\n21 For example, activities may include providing incentives and design guidelines for new building investment, and\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\ncan implement activities and create change relatively quickly, and promises to engage more\nparticipation through generating short-term results. On the other hand, incremental change may\nseem trivial to neighborhoods that have suffered widespread disinvestment, blight, and poverty.\nMoreover, a focus on smaller-scale incremental improvements may divert efforts and attention\nfrom larger-scale efforts, such as redevelopment of severely blighted properties, that several\nstudies cited as central to revitalization.\nA third unique aspect of the Main Street model is its emphasis on having volunteers do\nmuch of the program development and implementation work. Although many community\ndevelopment efforts, especially the comprehensive community initiatives, emphasize extensive\nvolunteer, especially resident, participation in planning and governance, they typically look to\nprofessional staff and community-based organizations to implement programs. Although the\nMain Street focus on volunteer participation is compatible with other grassroots community\ndevelopment organizations, it may create some tensions with community-based organizations\nthat emphasize professional management.22 The limited staff and heavy reliance on volunteers\nalso may pose a greater obstacle in urban neighborhoods than in other Main Street program\nsettings. Urban programs may require more staff capacity to address the greater revitalization\nchallenges in inner-city neighborhoods as well as constraints to recruiting and sustaining\nvolunteer involvement (Rucker 2001). Also, funders may be skeptical that organizations with\nlimited staff will have sufficient capacity and impact.23 Consequently, urban Main Street\nprograms may require either a larger staff, stronger partnerships with other organizations, or\nadoption by larger organizations to overcome these challenges. An important part of Main Street\n\nmarketing the area. Some Main Street economic restructuring efforts, e.g. South Side Pittsburgh, help small\nbusinesses secure financing.\n22 Rucker (2001) observed a tension between accountability to volunteer committees versus professional staff\nsupervisors among Main Street programs operated by CDCs.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nvolunteerism is its focus on gaining private-sector participation and funding support, which\nincreases business commitment to Main Street activities and can bridge the strong CBO\norientation toward residents. Moreover, the Main Street program's attention to creating a sound\nmarket basis for a business district benefits and speaks to the private-sector concerns.\nBest Practices\nThis final section summarizes the literature on best practices across four broad\ncomponents of practice:\n1. Institutional capacity -- the organizational capacity, support, and relationships critical to\nrevitalization efforts\n2. Planning and process -- the formulation of revitalization plans and the processes to\nmaintain momentum, support, and ongoing participation in plan implementation and\nupdating\n3. Strategies -- leveraging of inner-city advantages, broad choices in how to implement\nstrategies, and the integration or sequencing of different revitalization approaches\n4. Tools and Techniques -- lessons and best practices for applying specific tools and\ntechniques, such as facade improvement programs, business technical assistance, and market\nanalysis to inner-city commercial revitalization\n\nInstitutional Capacity\n\n23 This sentiment was expressed by a funding agency at a meeting related to the Boston Main Street program.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nOne of the most common issues addressed in the neighborhood revitalization literature is\nthe role of institutional capacity in revitalization and the relative importance of the public,\nprivate, and nonprofit sectors. Porter's 1995 article, which criticized past efforts for relying too\nheavily on public sector and nonprofit efforts to provide income support and social services and\nignoring the role of business-led economic development, has sparked much debate.\nAn entire book (Boston and Ross 1999) was devoted to responses to Porter. Some\nanalysts (Fainstein and Gray 1999) emphasized the importance of public sector -- especially city\ngovernment -- leadership and investment in inner-city economic development. Others (Butler\n1999; Sawicki and Moody 1999) supported Porter's contention that business investment and\ndevelopment is the engine for revitalization, and still others (Thomas 1999) emphasized the\nimportance of community-based initiatives.\nFerguson and Stoutland (1999) [does this refer to the entire book, as opposed to either of\ntheir individual chapters? Refers to individual article] provide a comprehensive\nconceptualization of community development institutions that defines them by their product --\ni.e., do they provide housing, policing, education, etc.; their form -- for-profit, nonprofit, or\ngovernmental organizations; and their level -- which defines the distance from direct resident\naction. \"Level zero\" organizations directly engage residents and households in volunteer\nactivities and social networks. \"Level one\" entities directly service neighborhood residents\nthrough paid staff, rather than volunteers across all sectors -- e.g., local stores and bank\nbranches; nonprofit community development corporations and service agencies; and\nneighborhood public schools, libraries, and police stations. \"Level two\" refers to city- and\nmetropolitan-level support institutions for level zero and level one organizations, and \"level\nthree\" refers to national level support institutions. This framework elucidates the large set of\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\ninstitutions within and outside the neighborhood that contribute to community development and\nrevitalization. It emphasizes that investment in level one organizations must be balanced with\n\"healthy interdependence among different levels and sectors of the community development\nsystem and the synergies possible between public, private, and non-profit sectors\" (p. 53)\nBeyond Ferguson and Stoutland's conceptual case for engaging institutions across\ndifferent levels and sectors, empirical studies of neighborhood revitalization emphasize the\nimportance of both collaboration among level one organizations and the leveraging of\nparticipation and resources from external organizations to successfully achieve revitalization. In\nhis recent study of the successful Pew Neighborhood Preservation Initiative,24 Wright (2001)\nargues that collaboration and joint projects among existing organizations, supported by financial\nand technical support from foundations and intermediaries, is a more viable means to implement\nrevitalization strategies than creating a new broad-based entity:\nWhat emerges from NPI [Neighborhood Preservation Initiative] is a promising\norganizational model for neighborhood development that stresses shared capacity:\nenabling a constellation of partner organizations linked on strategic joint projects,\nstrengthened in turn by technical and financial support from foundation and intermediary\npartners, to act collectively on neighborhood goals. As a model, the shared capacity\napproach proved to be effective and durable and appears to offer solid promise as a\nreplicable approach in other neighborhoods. (p. 167)\nMulkeen's (1997) study of revitalization in Boston's Codman Square business district also\nidentified shared capacity and coordinated action by established local nonprofit organizations as\ncentral to formulating and implementing a successful revitalization plan. Zielenbach (2002) also\nconcluded that the commitment and involvement of local institutions -- including hospitals,\nbanks, businesses, churches, and others -- explained why one neighborhood (North Lawndale)\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nexperienced revitalization, while another one (Elmwood), with disinterested local institutions,\ndeclined.\n\nOther authors cite the importance of city leadership and effective partnerships between\ncommunity organizations and city government in revitalization. Keating and Krumholz (1999)\nargue that CDCs alone lack the capacity to rebuild distressed neighborhoods, and point to the\nrole that progressive local governments played in Chicago and Boston. Hebert et al. (2001) found\nthat political continuity and leadership were important to sustaining a local vision for change in\nthe federal EZ/EC program. Peterman (2000), drawing on his experience with directing the\nUniversity of Illinois' Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement,\nconcludes that strong and direct ties between community leaders and public officials are critical\nto successful community development, but that these relationships must be neither too friendly\nnor too confrontational, but rather should constitute an atmosphere of \"creative tension.\"25\n\nThe importance of networks of communication, resources, and support to extend capacity\nof locally led renewal efforts is another common thread in the revitalization literature. Networks\nof banks; intermediaries; and city, state, and federal agencies play a vital role in facilitating\ncommunity-based affordable housing development (Keyes et al. 1996). Networks are also\nimportant in linking residents and businesses to regional economic opportunities beyond the\nneighborhood, as argued by Gittell and Thompson (1999) in their analysis of inner-city business\ndevelopment:\n\n24 The Neighborhood Preservation Initiative was a Pew Foundation-sponsored comprehensive community\ndevelopment initiative aimed at preserving the health of working-class urban neighborhoods in nine cities by\nsupporting projects and activities implemented through community-based organizations.\n25 Peterman cites four success factors: 1) ongoing human, technical, and financial resources; 2) grassroots\ncommunity organization; 3) the community leadership's external relationships with public officials; legal, technical,\nand financial experts; and coalitions; and 4) a relationship of creative tension between community leaders and\ngovernment officials.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nThere is considerable interest in a new vision of metropolitan areas criss-crossed\nby dense networks of business and social relations. Rather than emphasizing\nnetworks internal to communities, this view maintains that economic well-being\nof places depends on the extent to which their businesses and workers are\nconnected to economic activity in the region and beyond. (p. 493-4)\nNational intermediary organizations play an important role in these networks both by\nestablishing city-level resource and support networks and by connecting neighborhood\norganizations to national sources of funding, technical assistance, training, and\ninformation. Key national intermediary organizations include the Local Initiatives\nSupport Coalition (LISC), the Enterprise Foundation, the Neighborhood Reinvestment\nCorporation, [ ok to use NRC instead of NeighborWorks and NHS], and the Community\nPartners Program (Wright 1999). The Main Street program network includes the National\nTrust for Historic Preservation for information, training, and technical assistance;\nCommunity Partners (sponsored by the National Trust), which provides technical\nassistance, funding, and a network of local entities to support historic preservation\nprojects; state and city-level Main Street programs, which provide funding in addition to\nother assistance; and LISC, which helps fund and support CDC-based Main Street\nprograms.\nAlthough the extensive literature on building effective networks and collaborations is\nbeyond the scope of this report, several themes are worth highlighting. First, several authors\nemphasize the importance of shared vision, trust, reciprocity, and strong relationships among\nparties (Hebert et al. 2001; Keyes et al. 1996; Wallis Wallis not in refs, please provide ; Wright\n2001). Second, value conflicts among organizations need to be acknowledged and addressed\n(Thacher 1999; Wallis need ref/year; Wright 2001). Thacher's study of community policing\nidentifies three approaches to overcoming value conflicts: 1) reframing by using the\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\norganization's existing values to institutionalize new values and approaches; 2) creating a unit\nwithin the organization that fosters new values; and 3) working around value conflicts to forge\nagreements on the particulars of achieving practical goals.\nThird, several authors emphasize the importance of combining complementary capacities\nwithin networks (Powell and Smith 1994) and focusing on projects and activities in which there\nis mutual interest and that add value to each organization's work (Hebert et al. 2001; Keyes et al.\n1996; Wright 2001). An important collaboration issue for Main Street programs is domain\nconflict that can occur when multiple organizations have overlapping missions and service areas\n(Rucker 2001; Thacher 1999). Successfully managing domain conflicts requires practitioners to\njustify their activities, negotiate with each other, and reach agreement on their respective roles\nand domains (Thacher 1999).\n\nA final and fundamental best practice addresses the need for strong capacity in entities\nthat implement revitalization strategies. Several authors cite weak capacity among CDCs and\nother local organizations as limiting revitalization efforts (Halpern 1996; Kromer 2000). Wright\n(2001) attributes the capacity of the organizations that implemented Neighborhood Preservation\nInitiatives as critical to the program's success and emphasizes the importance of building\nrevitalization efforts around organizations with existing capacity. Hebert et al. (2001) found that\nstaff leadership and capacity were central to creating a broadly shared vision for revitalization,\nmaintaining continuity and focus on the vision, and building effective partnerships with EZ/EC\ncommunities.\nMain Street organizations face several challenges to developing capacity in urban\nsettings. Because they rely heavily on volunteers, Main Street programs must be able to recruit a\nstrong base of volunteers that includes recognized community leaders and persons with expertise\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nrelated to organizational development, design, marketing and promotion, and economic\nrestructuring (Dane 1988). This can be particularly difficult in low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods where many organizations recruit volunteers, residents and merchants have\nlimited available time and civic experience, and expertise in specific areas may be absent. (Dane\n1988; Rucker 2001; Seidman 2001). Recruiting and retaining staff with appropriate skills also is\na critical issue for Main Street organizations because they often rely on a single manager who\nneeds skills in outreach and relationship-building, communication, and program management,\nand staff turnover can stall progress (Seidman 2001). Implementing a Main Street program\nthrough a CDC mitigates these capacity challenges but can weaken the program's involvement\nof and connection to a broad base of community volunteers (Rucker 2001).\nSeveral implications for inner-city Main Street programs emerge from this discussion of\ninstitutional capacity. First, Main Street programs need to partner with other community-based,\ngovernment, and private-sector organizations to implement a comprehensive district\nrevitalization effort. The range of obstacles facing inner-city districts, and the small size and\nlimited capacity of Main Street programs, necessitate such partnerships. Moreover, these\npartnerships need to transcend participation in Main Street boards and committees to encompass\nimplementing specific projects and activities. Rucker identifies several potential synergies\nbetween Main Street programs and CDCs, including a Main Street initiative providing a means\nfor CDCs to expand their activities into commercial district revitalization and CDCs helping\nMain Street programs gain access to the CDC constituencies and real estate development\ncapacities.\nSecond, such partnerships require time and trust to develop, and benefit from establishing\na shared vision and goals for overall district revitalization. Third, although the strong national\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nintermediary network for the Main Street program enhances its effectiveness, the network's\nfocus could be expanded to play a larger role in leveraging program funding and generating local\nfoundation and corporate support.\nFinally, urban Main Street programs need to invest considerable resources in volunteer and board\nrecruitment and development, especially if they want to gain active participation among\nmerchants, property owners, and the full ethnic and class diversity of their neighborhoods\n(Seidman 2001).\nPlanning and Process\nResearch on comprehensive community development initiatives, the federal EZ/EC\ninitiative, and the Main Street program points to the importance of broad stakeholder\nparticipation, creating a shared vision, and building consensus on goals and plans. Also critical is\nthe need for ongoing outreach and communication in formulating effective revitalization plans\nand maintaining momentum, support, and ongoing participation in plan implementation.\nCommunity leaders from 50 organizations in Philadelphia's Frankford neighborhood\nworked with community residents to create consensus on how to revitalize their neighborhood.\nthe result was the Frankford Plan, which the city planning commission adopted as the city's\nofficial plan for the neighborhood. The planning process set the stage for greatly expanded\nresident participation, changed relationships among organizations, and aided in the leveraging of\noutside resources, including the Neighborhood Preservation Initiative grant and designation by\nLISC as one of its neighborhood Main Street demonstration sites. Hebert et al. (2001) concluded\nthat \"communities with a clear strategic vision of change, and one that could be effectively\ncommunicated to the affected stakeholders were more likely to be successful at mobilizing\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nsupport and in achieving progress in their zone activities\" (p. 9-2) Is this the correct page\nnumber? Yes The authors emphasized that a vision must go beyond broad themes to indicate\nhow it will be translated into specific programs and activities. Furthermore, this study found that\nconsensus among implementing authorities was another contributing factor in local program\nsuccess.\nNational Main Street program theory and reports also emphasize the importance of\ninvolving a broad set of stakeholders, active community participation, and a facilitator and\nconsensus-based approach to formulating plans (Dane 1997; Rucker 2001). In her review of the\nNational Main Street Center's Urban Demonstration Program, Dane (1988) observed that urban\nneighborhood programs needed to conduct more outreach and organizing than downtown\nprograms, both to gain the support and involvement of a large set of community-based\norganizations and to overcome resident skepticism and concerns about gentrification impacts.\nSeidman's (2001) study of the Boston Main Street program identified outreach, organizing, and\nconsensus building among stakeholders as important to local program effectiveness, but found\nthat local districts used different approaches to gain consensus. One district relied on board\nparticipation and close working relationships with local resident and merchant associations to\nsecure a shared vision, while an especially active and energetic manager secured the involvement\nand buy-in of diverse stakeholders in a second Main Street neighborhood. A third program\ncompleted detailed economic and market analysis to define an economic vision for its\ncommercial district and then conducted outreach to neighborhood associations and merchants to\ngain buy-in and implementation support. However, Seidman emphasized that broad-based\nparticipation and support required identifying and implementing a set of activities with appeal to\na broad group of stakeholders, especially merchants and residents.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nStrategies\nStrategies. Many authors have opinions about what constitutes an effective inner-city\neconomic development strategy, but little empirical research has tested the impact and\neffectiveness of specific strategies on commercial district revitalization. There is, however, some\nliterature that directly addresses or provides case study evidence on what constitutes best practice\nin implementing specific strategies. This section summarizes the emerging literature on several\nkey strategic issues for inner-city business district revitalization: opportunities to integrate\npeople- and place-based approaches; the type and character of commercial development projects,\nincluding the relative role of independent versus chain stores; inner-city business development\nopportunities; and addressing commercial gentrification.\nCombining People- and Place-Based Strategies. Although commercial district\nrevitalization is a place-based approach, opportunities exist to integrate people-based practices\ninto such efforts, largely around linking jobs to local residents. Supermarket projects in Newark,\nN.J., and Boston (Food Marketing Institute 1993; Hernandez 2001) demonstrate that employer\ncommitment to local hiring, combined with a community-based organization providing outreach,\nscreening, and placement services, can result in local residents securing a large share of jobs. Job\nplacement services could be offered to employers throughout a commercial district to target\nneighborhood jobs to local residents. Moreover, the relationships developed between CBOs and\nemployers around employment services could strengthen businesses involvement and support for\nother commercial district revitalization efforts.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nHowever, the quality of jobs in commercial districts, which are primarily in retail and\npersonal services industries, limit their potential to improve resident earnings.26 This limitation\ncould be addressed in two ways. First, lower-paying entry-level jobs can be used as part of a\nyouth development and employment program that introduces neighborhood youth to work,\ndevelops job readiness and social skills, and links them to broader career opportunities through\nadditional services. Second, commercial district jobs could be linked to better-paying jobs\noutside the neighborhood through career ladder programs. Commercial district jobs can develop\ncustomer service, communication, financial, or computer skills that could be combined with\nadditional training and job placement services to link residents to good-quality jobs in the\nregional economy. Community-based organizations could use their networks to leverage\nresidents' work experience and references gained in entry-level jobs in the business district and\nhelp them overcome job readiness and social network barriers to employment.\nCharacter of Commercial Development. Two key issues drive strategies for inner-city\ncommercial development. The first concerns choices about redevelopment versus building reuse,\nand the second addresses whether to focus on attracting national chain retailers versus\nindependent local and minority-owned retailers to development projects. These two issues are\ninterrelated because national retailers often seek large store formats and colocation with other\nchains, which require larger-scale redevelopment.\nNational Main Street Center literature focuses on the importance of retaining the existing\nhistoric building stock, and cites historic preservation as strong attraction for both residents and\nbusinesses (Dane 1997; Moe and Wilkie 1997). Other authors cite the typically poor quality of\n\n26 A New York Times article about the relocation of Black Entertainment Television from the Harlem EZ, stated that\nmost new jobs in Harlem have been low-paying. \"BET Ends Talks on New Studio and Says It is Leaving Harlem,\"\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nexisting buildings and the need to assemble and reconfigure sites to attract retailers (Ferguson,\nMiller, and Liston 1996; Porter 1997).\nThere is also evidence on both sides of the chain store/independent store issue.\nCompetition with shopping malls, the preferences of inner-city shoppers, and the growing\ninterest of national retailers in tapping inner-citymarkets all support attracting chain stores. On\nthe other hand, the stronger neighborhood employment record of local and minority-owned\nfirms, their capacity to support local wealth accumulation, and concerns about the gentrification\nand displacement impacts from increased rents that may accompany an influx of national\nretailers all support focusing on local independent stores.\nAlthough the resolution of these issues depends on community goals and the character\nand assets of each neighborhood business district, best practice is likely to require combining\nredevelopment and building reuse while attracting chain stores and supporting local independent\nbusinesses. Waxman's (1998) study on applying the economic theories of retail to inner-city\nbusiness districts discusses the importance of anchor destinations to create successful retail\ndistricts. Attracting supermarkets and large chain stores is one important way to anchor\nneighborhood business districts.27 Although all efforts should be made to attract anchor stores to\nthe existing building stock, and inner-city neighborhoods need to preserve their major historic\nbuildings and pedestrian-oriented character, redevelopment projects should be undertaken when\nthey are necessary to attract anchor stores and to eliminate seriously deteriorated and blighted\nproperties. To enhance the image and unique quality of the commercial district, redevelopment\n\nTerry Pristin New York Times, March 14, 2002--check date; also try to provide the author's name\n27 They are not the only options, however. Waxman's (1998) study of Upham's Corner identified a community\nhealth center, theater, and locally owned supermarket as the district anchors.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nprojects should complement the existing district character through the continuation of street\nwalls, building size and choice of materials.\nExisting practice also suggests that new larger-scale and chain-store development can be\nlinked to supporting a base of independent locally owned businesses. First, the development\ndesign should integrate anchor chain stores with independent retailers so that independent\nretailers gain the benefit of customer traffic generated by the anchor stores (Hernandez 2001).\nThis requires project planning, design, and leasing that do not segregate chain stores and\nindependent retailers in different portions of a business district, but rather places them in\nadjacent locations.\nSecond, commercial district revitalization efforts should include business development\nand technical assistance services that help independent retailers adjust to and gain the benefits of\nnew chain stores locating in their neighborhood. Although this should be an ongoing activity,\ndirect funding for such activities can be built into large development projects, as was done in a\nBoston Stop N Shop development. (Hernandez 2001).\nFinally, a strong presence of local stores should be maintained to help create a unique\ncharacter and retail focus that helps differentiate inner-city districts from shopping centers\ndominated by chain stores (Waxman 1998),\nBusiness Development Opportunities. The literature suggests two important best practices\nfor formulating and implementing inner-city business development strategies.\nFirst, business attraction and development opportunities need to be linked to real market\nopportunities. Waxman (1998) identifies two important concepts in defining these opportunities.\nOne concept is the distinction between convenience and comparison goods. All business districts\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\ncan support convenience shopping destinations that customers choose based on proximity and\nconvenience. Commercial districts can expand their convenience shopping market by filling gaps\nin their existing offerings -- for example, by adding a video store or laundry where one does not\nexist. Consumers seek an agglomeration of stores with similar or related products when shopping\nfor comparison goods because they save them time by comparing products and prices in several\nnearby stores (DiPasquale and Wheaton 1996). This finding suggests that inner-city districts can\nalso build a comparison shopping destination where multiple stores offer similar products.\nSuccessful strategies are likely to be based on either expanding existing concentrations of\ncomparison goods stores or attracting multiple new stores in the same category. Waxman's\nsecond concept is market segmentation: shopping patterns and preferences vary across\ndemographics group, as defined by age, ethnicity, income, or race. Business can expand their\nmarkets by tailoring there products and services to underserved demographic groups.\nThe second best practice for developing business opportunities concerns the need to link\nsmall businesses to networks for training, technical assistance, and financing. Although there is\nconsiderable need for technical assistance to improve the skills and capacities of small\nbusinesses, local Main Street organizations and CDCs are unlikely to have the expertise and\ncapacity to address the full range of needs, particularly the specialized needs of all retail and\nservice businesses. Thus, commercial district programs need to go beyond generalized business\nassistance to develop networks that can connect businesses to more specialized services, and help\ncreate citywide associations or services to support the needs of specialized business categories.\nThree models of such activities exist. One is New York's Business Outreach Centers,\nwhich develop and support a large referral network for neighborhood businesses. A second\noption is the trade association, which supports the specialized information and service needs of\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nparticular industries. [any reason not to advocate this for any type of approach? No the three\napproaches are not mutually exclusive--you could add a footnote with this point] Business\ndevelopment strategies might look at ways to foster local business participation in existing trade\nassociations and to create regional, state, or city associations that address the needs of businesses\nthat are most critical to neighborhood business districts. Third, Rauch (1996) advocates\nsupporting independent buying agents to help independent African-American apparel and\naccessory stores search for and obtain the most appropriate products for their customers. This\ntype of approach could be extended to other types of inner-city businesses for which finding and\nbuying the appropriate merchandise is critical to business success.\nAlthough gentrification is not a primary focus of this paper, the literature on urban Main\nStreet programs emphasizes the importance of addressing gentrification issues (Dane 1988;\nRucker 2001). Experience from the Main Street Urban Demonstration Program suggests that\ncommercial gentrification can be addressed by monitoring and informing the community of the\nspecific reasons for business and property turnover to dispel false rumors and perceptions, and\nby assisting business owners in acquiring their rented properties (Dane 1988). However, these\napproaches are likely to be insufficient when gentrification pressures are particularly strong or\nfast-paced.\nSuccessful efforts to prevent widespread gentrification and displacement within the\ncommercial district need to be based on the community's vision for the type of businesses and\nactivities that it seeks to attract and on pursuing a range of activities to advance this vision\n(Thrash 2001). Depending on local goals, conditions, and resources, these activities may include\nproviding business development and technical assistance service to improve the performance of\nexisting businesses, providing technical and financial assistance to help local firms acquire their\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nproperty, establishing nonprofit and/or land trust ownership of real estate dedicated to preserving\ncertain businesses and uses, and developing projects that combine locally owned and chain\nstores.\n\nTools and Techniques\nThis section highlights effective tools, techniques, and activities used to implement inner-\ncity commercial district revitalization based on practice-oriented studies. It draws primarily on\npublications from the National Main Street Center, Seidman's (2001) study of the Boston Main\nStreet Program, Waxman's (1998) analysis of inner-city retailing, and a summary of the Urban\nLand Institute's work in inner-city neighborhoods (Suchman 1994). The discussion is organized\naround four areas: physical improvement and commercial development, business development,\nmarketing and promotion, and districtwide coordination and management.\nPhysical Improvement and Commercial Development. Most commercial revitalization\nefforts emphasize physical improvements to the existing building stock as a tool to change an\narea's image, eliminate blight and attract more shoppers and businesses. Main Street program\nliterature (Dane 1988; Smith, Joncas, and Parrish 1991) and other studies (Community Services\nCollaborative 1994; Seidman 2001) emphasize the importance of three elements in successful\nbuilding improvement efforts:\n1. outreach and education to increase understanding of the impact of good design and physical\nimprovements on the commercial district and business performance\n2. technical assistance to help businesses and property owners prepare a good design and\nmanage the contracting and permitting process\n3. financial incentives through grants, low-interest loans, or both to encourage property and\nbusiness owners to make improvements\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nA best practice concern is what properties to target for building improvements and\ncommercial development projects. Seidman (2001) emphasizes targeting the district's largest and\nmost prominent buildings to generate a significant visual impact, and points to the Hyde Park\n(Boston) [correct? yes]Main Street program's success in convincing owners of five large\nbuildings to complete major facade and store improvements. Main Street literature emphasizes\nthe importance of restoring historic building facades (Smith, Joncas, and Parrish 1991) and\nimplementing building improvements incrementally, beginning with smaller-scale facade\nprojects and then expanding to larger-scale projects once property owners recognize the value of\nbuilding improvements.\nOn the other hand, research on inner-city commercial development emphasizes the\nimportance of both targeting severely blighted properties for reuse and redevelopment to reduce\ncrime and negative perceptions (Hernandez 2001) and developing catalytic projects to generate\nsubstantial spin-off investment. (Fernandes 1997; Taub 1988). Best practice entails a\ncombination of both approaches so that momentum and change are generated by smaller-scale\nprojects while work on long-term catalytic projects proceeds.\nDesign guidelines are another element of best practice because they help to preserve\nimportant elements of a district's character, foster better-quality improvements, and codify a\ndesign vision for the district (Dane 1988; Smith, Joncas, and Parrish 1991). However, design\nguidelines should be based on community as well as professional input, and ultimately should\nreflect the neighborhood's character and desired image. For example, the Hyde/Jackson Square\nMain Street program developed design guidelines that emphasized the district's Hispanic\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\ncharacter (Seidman 2001). Revitalization efforts also need to be coordinated with city planning\nofficials to streamline the development approvals and permitting process to make it less\ncumbersome to implement building improvement and development projects (Suchman 1994).\nMany authors cite the need for subsidies and investment incentives to complete\ncommercial development projects in weak inner-city real estate markets where development\ncosts greatly exceed a project's completed value (Fernandes 1997; Hernandez 2001; Suchman\n1994; Wright 1999). Large subsidies are especially important for the initial projects that help\nrebuild a local real estate market (Suchman 1994), but some level of continued subsidy may be\nneeded given the greater obstacles and higher development costs in urban areas. Many\nresearchers advocate for the federal government to continue and expand programs that provide\ndirect subsidies and incentives for private-sector support, including Community Development\nBlock Grants, CRA, and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit [CRA is not a subsidy yes I agree\nwith the edit ] (Bright 2000; Grogan and Proscio 2000; Wright 1999). Some authors argue for the\nequivalent of a low-income housing tax credit to attract private investment to inner-city\ncommercial projects (Bright 2000; Wright 1999).\nPhysical improvement efforts should transcend the building stock and address the\ndistrict's overall appearance, public spaces, and infrastructure. BID experience highlights the\nvalue of maintaining a clean district through graffiti removal, sidewalk cleaning, and other\nservices (Houston 1997; Mitchell 2001; Ryan 2000) as well as providing maps and signs to\ndirect and orient visitors (Ryan 2000).\nExperience with the Neighborhood Preservation Initiative in Philadelphia and Boston\ndemonstrates how beautification projects can support community building by getting different\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nsegments of the community to work together. In the Frankford Philadelphia neighborhood,\nleaders solicited ideas for improvements projects from residents and required the recruitment of\n25 resident volunteers to fund an activity. Teams from two sides of the neighborhood worked\ntogether to complete the project, bringing together people of different races and incomes. East\nBoston actively recruited youth to participate in annual commercial district clean-up and\nbeautification, which gave young people a larger stake in the district while changing adult\nperceptions of youth (Wright 2001).\nExperts convened by the Urban Land Institute recommended multiple activities to\nenhance the image and appearance of inner-city neighborhoods, including: using gateways or\nrecurring design symbols to defining the district boundaries and promote a clear identity;\ncleaning up the area by removing blighted structures, overgrown lots, garbage, and exterior\nstorage yards; adding amenities such as playgrounds, parks, and natural features; creating a focus\nfor the community through some version of a \"town center;\" and clustering commercial\ndevelopment at intersections (Suchman 1994). Smith, Joncas, and Parrish (1991) emphasize\ncompleting a comprehensive inventory of district conditions before preparing a physical\nimprovement plan; designing improvements that enhance pedestrian movement within the\ndistrict and to stores; providing for proper maintenance of public spaces; placing signage to\ndirect people to and around the district; and coordinating building and public improvements.\nBusiness Development. Business development efforts encompass both helping to retain\nand expand existing businesses and recruiting new businesses. Several studies point to the\nimportance of providing technical assistance services to existing businesses (Dane 1988; Hebert\net al. 2001; Seidman 2001; Suchman 1994; Waxman 1998). Key services to provide include\nbasic business planning, help in securing loans, assistance in securing government licenses and\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\npermits, advice on merchandising and marketing, and referrals to specialized professionals and\nservice providers. Neighborhood economic development programs have used different tools to\nprovide these services.\nSeveral Boston Main Street programs work with CDCs that provide business technical\nassistance to local firms, with Main Street staff conducting outreach and providing introductions\nand referrals to CDC staff. In Pittsburgh, the South Side Local Development Corporation\norganized business assistance teams with both government and private-sector members to offer\nquarterly workshops, provide information on key business issues, review business plans, and\nhelp firms access the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority's revolving loan fund (Dane\n1988, 1997). The prior section on strategies highlights how New York's Business Outreach\nCenters help neighborhood businesses access and utilize a broad range of services.\nA key technical assistance goal is helping businesses better serve the local customer base.\nCompleting a detailed market analysis of the neighborhood is a critical tool to help businesses\nbetter define and understand their potential market and identify new ways to reach and serve\nthem. Some authors emphasize the need to obtain professional market analysis assistance, while\nMain Street documents provide guidance on how volunteer committees can undertake this task.\nThe Boston Main Street program has combined both approaches by hiring a consultant to work\nwith district staff and volunteers in completing and interpreting their market analysis. After\ncompleting the market analysis, local programs need to invest time and resources to help\nbusinesses apply the analysis and implement changes in merchandising, marketing, and other\npractices.\nMerchants can use several approaches to take advantage of underserved market needs in\na commercial district. First, businesses can identify new customer segments to serve and\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nreposition their businesses to attract them (Smith, Joncas, and Parrish 1991; Waxman 1998). For\nexample, the Hyde/Jackson Main Street program (Boston) worked with Latino merchants to\nexpand their merchandising and communicate in both English and Spanish to attract a growing\nwhite population. Second, merchants can expand their product lines to offer more items that\nappeal to customers. Expanding convenience goods is particularly lucrative because, as stated\npreviously, residents are strongly tied to local merchants for these goods. For example, an\nexisting retailer could add movie rentals to its product offering in lieu of the community\nattracting a new video store. Waxman (1998) recommends that firms install inventory control\nsystems to identify top-selling items, help determine the strongest retail niches, and show\nmerchants where they are making their money.\n\nSeveral factors inform the effective recruitment of new businesses. Targeted businesses\nneed to be viable in the marketplace by either addressing unmet convenience shopping needs or\nsynergies with existing retail niches (Suchman 1994; Smith, Joncas, and Parrish 1991; Waxman\n1998). Attracting an anchor store that can draw a large number of customers is another\nrecruitment priority, especially for districts with no or very few anchor destinations (Waxman\n1998). Recruitment efforts need to encompass both national chain stores and independent\nretailers because they offer different advantages. National stores provide brand recognition,\nresources, and the perception of safety that draws a larger clientele to the district, while local\nindependent businesses increase local wealth, are more likely to hire locally, and address niches\nthat national stores do not serve (Gittell and Thompson 1999; Hernandez 2001; Waxman 1998).\nOther factors that affect the targeting of business types include competition from nearby\nshopping areas, the size and location of existing vacant space and new commercial space under\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\ndevelopment, and the demographic characteristics of the neighborhood populations and the\ncustomers that the district seeks to attract.\nA number of practices have been used or recommended to attract new businesses,\nalthough there is no consensus about what constitutes best practice. Dane (1988) cites holding\nbusiness recruitment fairs, matching prospective businesses to property owners with vacant\nspace, and helping new businesses secure city permits as effective practices. Both Smith, Joncas,\nand Parrish (1991) and Waxman (1998) emphasize the importance of preparing and\ndisseminating a marketing packet with information on demographics of the district's customer\nbase, development plans, foot and auto traffic counts, a list of stores in specific niches, the\nparticulars of available space, and other positive attributes. Waxman also recommends\nmaintaining a database of existing vacant properties, creating positive relationships with existing\nproperty owners, and involving them in formulating and implementing an overall recruitment\nstrategy.\nGittell and Thompson (1999) and Waxman (1998) cite the need to mimic shopping mall\ndevelopers by charging lower rents to anchor tenants and tenants that make early commitments\nto a district. Waxman also suggests creating a rental subsidy fund for a district (which could also\nprovide an incentive to property owners to keep a space vacant until a desired type of business is\nsecured), while Gittell and Thompson (1999) advocate granting control over entire blocks to a\ndeveloper. Finally, some Main Street programs directly undertake development projects to\ncontrol leasing and attract new businesses to a district (Dane 1988).\nA practice that supports both business retention and store recruitment is exploiting retail\nlinkages and strengthening niches or comparison shopping clusters within a district (Smith,\nJoncas, and Parrish 1991; Waxman 1998). Such efforts include organizing firms within a niche\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nor in closely linked businesses to work together to market and exploit their linkages. Customer\nsurveys and data from inventory control systems are useful ways identify linkages and synergies\namong stores. Related stores and niches then can be promoted by placing a logo in store\nwindows that identify niche members; sponsoring joint advertising through newspapers, radio, or\nTV; preparing shopping guides and fliers that market specialized niches; and running special\npromotions and events to link shopping in related businesses.\nAs discussed previously, business recruitment efforts also should target businesses that\nstrengthen a district's specialization and comparison shopping niches. A larger set of stores with\na niche and a unified marketing effort can expand a district's customer base by attracting\nshoppers from a larger market area. Authors, case studies, and market data suggest that viable\nniches for inner-city commercial districts include arts, culture, and entertainment (Dane 1988,\n1997; Suchman 1994); restaurants (Suchman 1994); clothing and accessories (ICIC and PWC\n2000); ethnic markets (ICIC and PWC 2000; Waxman 1998); and health services (Waxman\n1998).\nMarketing and Promotion. Marketing and promotion activities are central to improving a\ncommercial district's image, helping to attract new customers, recruiting new businesses, and\nencouraging investment. These efforts also directly support the district's businesses by\nincreasing their customer base and sales. Promotion efforts also are important because they can\nbe implemented fairly quickly, thus providing a focus for short-term activities that build\nmomentum before longer-term improvement projects are implemented (Dane 1988). Best\npractice literature on commercial district marketing focuses on four aspects: 1) the value of\nmarket analysis in formulating marketing activities, 2) the importance of creating an overall\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\ndistrict image, 3) the role of community events in district promotion, and 4) organizing retail\npromotions among merchants.\nMarket analysis helps inform promotion activities in several ways. It identifies the\ndistrict's major current and potential customer segments, what attracts them to the district, their\nview of unfavorable district characteristics, how they might respond to different promotions, the\nmajor sources of competition, and the best media outlets to reach different consumer segments.\nThis information helps organizations discern how best to define or position their district relative\nto competing districts, define a district image that is most likely to appeal to key customer\ngroups, and decide on specific marketing events and promotions (Smith, Joncas, and Parrish\n1991; Waxman 1998).\n\nDefining a unique image or brand identity for a commercial district helps to change\nnegative perceptions and differentiates the area from shopping malls and competing retail centers\n(Dane 1988; Gratz and Mintz 2000; Suchman 1994; Smith, Joncas, and Parrish 1991, Toups and\nCarr 2000). A district's image should be built around its unique assets, which may include\nhistoric buildings, key landmarks, specialized retail niches or uses, ethnic composition, or other\ncharacteristics (Gratz and Mintz 2000; Smith, Joncas, and Parrish 1991). An important part of\nimproving the image of inner-city districts is reducing the sources of poor images, including\ncrime, blighted conditions, lack of cleanliness, and undesirable uses (Seidman 2001; Suchman\n1994; Toups and Carr 2000,Waxman 1998). This suggests that effective image building needs to\naccompany, if not follow, progress toward improving those conditions. Although Dane (1988)\nfound that urban neighborhood business districts have trouble identifying and building an image\nthat differentiates them from other such areas, but Toups and Carr (2000) identify five strategies\nthat distressed neighborhoods use to create a positive image. These strategies are: (1) build a\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\ntown center or neighborhood \"heart\" that can become a new positive symbol; (2) create a new\nname (possibly with a logo) that conveys a positive image; (3) package and capitalize on existing\npositive assets such as history, culture and architecture; (4) make visible physical improvements\nthat demonstrate change and neighborhood pride; and (5) undertake a marketing and public\nrelations campaign to communicate the new image.\nSeveral authors cite special events as supporting revitalization efforts in multiple ways.\nThey bring residents together for a positive experience, helping to both overcome negative\nperceptions and strengthen connections to the district (Dane 1988; Seidman 2001). They also\nincrease shopping among the existing customers while introducing the district to a larger\naudience, thus helping to expand its market. Finally, special events help build a sense of\ncommunity within the neighborhood and strengthen the district's role as a community center\n(Wright 2001).\nDane (1988) emphasizes the importance of devoting considerable time and resources to\nplanning, advertising, and holding the event; having experienced professional staff to organize it;\nand generating creative ideas to attract the public year after year. Gratz and Mintz (2000) cite\nsponsoring farmers' markets as an especially successful and cost-effective way to attract\nshoppers to commercial districts. Smith, Joncas, and Parrish (1991) identify cultural heritage,\nholidays, and social occasions as common themes for events, and recommend that they include\nlively and entertaining activities with music, food, something for children, something free, and\noverlapping activities.\nA multicultural performance series was an important community-building activity in East\nBoston's Maverick Square district (Wright 2001). Other Boston Main Street districts\nsuccessfully used holiday tree lightings, historic house tours, Easter egg hunts, and street\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nfestivals to build resident support for and participation in the Main Street program and to\nincrease a sense of community pride (Seidman 2001).\nRetail promotions entail special sales and cooperative advertising to directly stimulate\nincreased patronage of the commercial district. Smith, Joncas, and Parrish (1991) distinguish\nbetween sales, which involve price discounts, and retail events that attract shoppers through\nother means. Retail promotions provide an effective way to involve merchants in district\nrevitalization efforts and to build cooperative relationships among independent-minded business\npeople (Dane 1998; Seidman 2001). In three Boston Main Street districts, it was found that\nmerchants were more likely to participate in retail promotions and cooperative advertising than\nin other Main Street activities (Seidman 2001). Coordinated promotions support the retailers by\nincreasing customer traffic, which in turn increases sales for the entire district (DiPasquale and\nWheaton 1996). The Boston Main Street program supports a citywide neighborhood holiday\nshopping promotion, called Boston Unwrapped, with citywide advertising, special shopping\nbags, and bumper stickers. Local districts add their own events and special promotions (e.g., tree\nlighting ceremonies). This approach is consistent with Dane's (1988) observation that retail\npromotions that are linked with special events are most effective.\nDistrictwide Coordination and Management. Although coordinating the actions of\nmultiple parties is a key theme in many of the practices discussed throughout this section, several\npractices are particularly important to effective coordination of commercial district revitalization\nefforts.\nFirst, the creation of a broadly shared vision and revitalization plan for the entire district,\nbased on the active participation of key stakeholder groups, is evident in several successful\nrevitalization efforts and is emphasized by several researchers (Mulkeen 1997; Seidman 2001;\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nSuchman 1994; Waxman 1998; Wright 2001). Although the creation of such a plan takes\nconsiderable time, it is central to building broad-based support for revitalization, by helping to\nrecruit volunteers and broadening the resource network for implementation. While the vision and\nplan are being formulated, revitalization work can go forward on short-term projects for which\nthere is a clear consensus on appropriate actions.\nSecond, ongoing outreach and communication are needed to keep all stakeholders\ninformed of progress, recruit new volunteers and support, and remind people of revitalization\nplans and priorities.\nThird, special efforts are needed to cultivate the involvement of property owners, smaller\nmerchants, low-income residents, and linguistic minorities, and to design and implement a set of\nactivities that addresses needs and concerns across these different groups (Seidman 2001).\nFinally, several activities provide a special opportunity to coordinate work districtwide\nand across stakeholder groups. They include the formulation of design guidelines, the\npreparation of an improvement plan for public infrastructure and spaces, and organizing large\nspecial events that are linked to district promotions.\nConclusions\nThis literature review suggests that commercial district revitalization is an important\ncomponent in place-based community development, but requires integration with other strategies\nto overcome the long-standing demographic and economic forces that lead to inner-city\ndisinvestment and to generate overall neighborhood revitalization. Commercial revitalization\ninitiatives should be combined with housing improvement and development projects; sustained\ncrime reduction efforts; improved health, education, and family support services; and education\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nand workforce development programs that link residents to job and career opportunities\nthroughout the regional economy as part of a comprehensive effort to create neighborhoodwide\nrevitalization that substantially benefits existing low- and moderate-income residents.\nThe Main Street strategy promises to be an effective approach to revitalizing inner-city\ncommercial districts if it is adapted to fit inner-city conditions. It provides a clearer framework\nfor action and a more comprehensive approach than other commercial district improvement\nstrategies. Its framework and range of activities leverage several advantages of inner-city\nneighborhoods while addressing many of their obstacles to revitalization. The Main Street\nprogram, however, faces challenges to providing an effective framework and strategy for the\nrevitalizing inner-city business districts.\nFirst, it needs to incorporate key inner-city concerns, such as public safety and the\nmanagement of gentrification, into its strategic framework. Second, Main Street programs\nrequire greater resources and capacity to address the challenges of inner-city neighborhoods,\ncompared with their historic use in towns and small cities. This is likely to require a broader\ncoalition and base of support, greater staff capacity, and more partnerships with other\norganizations. Third, greater attention to and subsidies for real estate development activities will\nbe needed to address redevelopment of severely blighted properties and to attract key anchor\nbusinesses.\nMore research and codification of best practices in inner-city commercial district\nrevitalization is needed. Although considerable literature exists on downtown development and\non applying the Main Street approach in central business districts, there is limited empirical\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F. Seidman\n\nresearch specifically geared toward inner-city commercial districts. Research would be\nparticularly useful on:\n- integrating commercial revitalization with other place-based and people-based initiatives\n- effective crime prevention approaches in business districts\n- creating linkages and synergies between independent and national chain stores\n- effective business recruitment practices and tools to coordinate landlord leasing with\ncommunity preferences and market opportunities\nthe process for defining and building a suitable image and integrating it with marketing, business\ndevelopment, and broader revitalization efforts\n______________________________________________________________________________\nInner City Commercial Revitalization\nKarl F.
