  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis course, which is the first subject in the Nuclear Science and Engineering undergraduate degree sequence, has no prerequisites. It is generally taken in the first semester of sophomore year, after two semesters of freshman calculus and physics.\n\nIntroduction to the Course\n\nWelcome to 22.01! We have flipped the classroom--where you watch lectures or read textbook chapters ahead of recitations and problem-solving sessions. The choice is yours! Note: Videos are not available to OCW users.\n\nRadiation is the central aspect which makes nuclear science and engineering (NSE) its own discipline, and sets the foundation for almost all of modern physics. We will begin by retracing the steps of famous radiation experiments and hypotheses. Next we will set the stage and context for our study of radiation, by showing details of the systems and reactors which use radiation. The rest of the course will be dedicated to describing the origins, interactions, uses, detection, and biological / chemical effects of ionizing radiation.\n\nRequired Textbook\n\nTurner, James E.\nAtoms, Radiation, and Radiation Protection\n. 3rd ed. Wiley-VCH, 2007. ISBN: 9783527406067.\n\nGrading\n\nASSIGNMENTS\n\nDESCRIPTIONS\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nProblem sets (9)\n\nSimpler calculations with either a lab or a couple of difficult problems\n\n4.4% each\n\nQuizzes (3)\n\nTesting your ability to use 22.01 topics, intuitively and mathematically\n\n20% each\n\nThe last quiz is really just a quiz, not a full-blown final exam. It is given during the last day of class over a 24 hour period of your choice.\n\nHomework Assignments: Building Skills, Testing Intuition, Confirming Theory\n\nApproximately half of each problem set will consist of simpler questions, designed to build critical mathematical, scientific, and intuitive skills to solve problems in radiation science. The other half alternates between analytical questions of considerable difficulty and take-home laboratory exercises where you will have to make and explain measurements related to radioactivity.\n\nAnalytical Questions of Considerable Difficulty (Noodle Scratchers)\n\nThese will consist of open-ended questions, where you have to make key assumptions, choose your problem-solving approach, and work out the intermediate steps yourself. Grades for these problems will be based on how you set up the problems, how you define assumptions, and your intermediate work. We will usually give you the final answer so you can check your approach.\n\nWe will assign teams of 3-4 for the problem sets, changing the team makeup each month. It is up to you how and when you arrange to meet and work together, and whether it is in person or online through videoconferencing, Slack, or similar free services.\n\nEveryone should still submit their own copy of the problem set, even if you work together to create shared solutions, MATLAB scripts, Mathematica notebooks, or however else you choose to work on the problems.\n\nWorking Together, Academic Integrity\n\nWorking together is OK, and required on the difficult problems (noodle scratchers)! When you work in a team, you must do the following:\n\nAcknowledge your team members prominently.\n\nWrite/typeset your own problem sets (no xeroxing). This is to help reinforce all the learning objectives of the problem sets.\n\nState who did which parts of the assignment. If we sense that someone is doing almost all the work, we will meet with you to prevent this sort of thing.\n\nIt's OK to take one set of data together as a team, as long as you say who took the data.\n\nIn addition, all students must read the\nMIT guidelines on academic honesty and integrity\n.\n\nLate Policy\n\n33% of the value of a given assignment will be deducted for each calendar day late, as marked on the Canvas site, unless an extension is granted ahead of time. If you're going to hand something in late, you have to tell the instructor early. We will be very accommodating. This way, problem set answers can be automatically released a couple of days after they are due.",

To get really technical (not required for full credit), this minimizes the asymmetry\nterm in the semi-empirical mass formula, or maximizes the same term in the binding energy formulation of\nthe same equation:\nBE (A, Z) = ... -aa\n(N -Z)2\nA\n+ ...\n(1)\nFinally, the reason it is very proton-rich and not slightly proton-rich is that more asymmetry (and lower\nbinding energy) leads to a higher Q-value, and positron decay requires at least Q ≥1.022 MeV to occur.\n1.2\nEstimate, to an order of magnitude, how much heavier/lighter the meta-\nstate of Technetium (99mTc) is compared to its ground state 99Tc.\nThe\nmeta-state energy of 99mTc is at 0.143 MeV. Call it 0.1 MeV for simplicity.\nSimple answer: One part per million.\nThe mass-energy of 99Tc is roughly 99 nucleons times our conversion factor of 931.94937\nMeV\namu-c2 . Let's\ncall it 100 nucleons and 1000\nMeV\namu-c2 . That gives us a rest mass energy of about 102 ∗103 = 105MeV , and\n\nan excited state energy of 10-1 MeV . Divide these two for our answer:\n10-1 MeV\n105 MeV\n= 10-6 = 1 ppm\n(2)\nThe excited state of 99mTc is about 1 part per million (ppm) heavier than its ground state of 99Tc!\n1.3\nUnder what physical/mathematical condition(s) could an isotope theoreti-\ncally decay by direct emission of a 14C nucleus?\nSame as everything: Q>0!\nAs long as the nuclear reaction has a positive Q-value (exothermic), literally anything is possible. There\nwould probably be some activation energy to overcome for this to happen, akin to ssion but not quite as\nstrong, but you don't need to say so for full credit here.\nHere is the equation which would describe this reaction:\nA\nZP →A-14\nZ-6 D +14\n6 C + Q\n(3)\nHere is a snapshot of one example isotope from the Table of Nuclides which actually does this!\nAnd here is a description of this phenomenon in general, known as cluster radioactivity: https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCL\n1.4\nWhy is inelastic scattering (n, n′) not truly a scattering reaction?\nUse\naspects of the generalized Q-equation (see Eq. 23) for your answer.\nSimply put, Q = 0.\nScattering is an energy-conserving transfer of momentum from one particle to another, with that transfer\ndependent on scattering angle. Neutron inelastic scattering is actually neutron absorption, followed by the\nformation of a compound nucleus, and emission of a more bound neutron, leading to net energy absorption\n(Q < 0) by the nucleus.\n1.5\nWhy shouldn't we round nuclear masses/binding energies when identifying\ngamma peaks on a high-purity Germanium detector (HPGe) spectrum,\nlike that of our Chernobyl honey?\nAssume these detectors have energy\nresolutions of ~0.5 keV.\nThe simple answer: Rounding errors and energy resolution\n(c) Source unknown. All rights reserved. This content is\nexcluded from our Creative Commons license. For more\ninformation, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use.\n\nIf you round even the sixth decimal place, because of the conversion factor of 931.49437 MeV\namu-c2\n, your answer\ncould be o by at least 1 keV, or twice the resolution of the detector. That could lead to mis-identication of\ngamma peaks!\n1.6\nFukushima released about 25 PBq of radiation (2.5 × 1019 Bq), which is a\nHUGE amount and on par with that released from Chernobyl. By what\nmath/logic would you explain to someone that sh in the ocean are still\nsafe to eat?\nThe two-sentence answer: Specic activity.\nTo get a bit more nuanced, Chernobyl released lots of radiation which deposited on the ground and stayed\nrelatively put, causing massive contamination of a smaller area of topsoil and rendering plants/animals\nnearby far too radioactive for safe consumption. By contrast, almost all of Fukushima's radiation release\nwas into the ocean, either by direct water discharge or atmospheric discharge settling onto the water, where\nit got diluted by the very large volume of the ocean to levels far below the natural radioactivity of the ocean.\nTo get quantitative (not required for full credit), the ocean naturally contains about 11,000 Bq\nm3 of radioac-\ntivity, mostly from 40K. The release from Fukushima added about 0.1% to this - a large absolute release, but\na relatively small rise in specic activity.\n1.7\nUnder what criterion could one theoretically observe alpha particle emission\nat an energy of Eα = Q?\nThe simple answer: M (A, Z) →inf\nBecause of conservation of kinetic energy and momentum, one could only observe an alpha particle with\nkinetic energy equal to the total Q-value if the parent (and therefore daughter) nucleus had nearly innite\nmass. This would allow the two particles to have equal momenta, while the innite mass of the daughter\nnucleus would allow its velocity to approach zero, giving all the kinetic energy to the alpha particle.\n\n(30 points):\nSet up (do not solve) equations for, and sketch\nan approximate graph of, the amount of each of three isotopes\n(N1, N2, N3) in a series decay chain inside a nuclear reactor with\nneutron ux Φ, where N3 is stable, and Φσ1 = Φσ2 = Φσ3 = λ1 = λ2.\nPay attention to amounts and rates of change of the isotopes at\nkey points (t = 0, t = inf, places where dNi\ndt = 0).\nWhy can't you\ncalculate it so easily from Equation 26 below, and why doesn't\nit appear that the total mass of the isotopes is conserved on this\ngraph?\nOverall Philosophy: The big dierence between the graphs we developed in class and this problem is that the\nextra neutron burning (Φσi) means that the rates of decay of N1 and N2 are twice as fast as they would\nbe from natural decay, and that the stable isotope N1 will still undergo articial decay at half the rates of\nN1 and N2. This is because the removal rate of each isotope in the reactor is equal to the rate of natural,\nradioactive decay of N1 and N2.\nSetting Up the Equations: The following equations would apply here, which will help us be more quanti-\ntative and exact in drawing our approximate solutions:\ndN1\ndt\n= -(λ1 + Φσ1) N1;\nN1 (t = 0) = N0\n(4)\ndN2\ndt\n= +λ1N1 -(λ2 + Φσ2) N2;\nN2 (t = 0) = 0\n(5)\ndN3\ndt\n= +λ2N2 -λ3N3;\nN3 (t = 0) = 0\n(6)\nNow let's use the simplifying assumption from the problem statement (λ1 = λ2 = Φσ1 = Φσ2 = Φσ3), and\nset each equal to some simple value λ:\ndN1\ndt\n= -2λN1;\nN1 (t = 0) = N0\n(7)\ndN2\ndt\n= λN1 -2λN2;\nN2 (t = 0) = 0\n(8)\ndN3\ndt\n= λN2 -λN3;\nN3 (t = 0) = 0\n(9)\nUsing these equations, we can start to set slopes equal to zero to nd relative maxima of each curve without\nsolving anything!\nGetting Quantitative: It's important here to draw the starting slope of N2 as equal to half the negative\nof that of N1, and the starting slope of N3 should still be zero. This comes from plugging in t = 0 to the\nthree equations above and reading o slopes directly:\ndN1 (t = 0)\ndt\n= -2λN0\n(10)\ndN2 (t = 0)\ndt\n= λN0 -2λ (0) = λN0\n(11)\ndN3 (t = 0)\ndt\n= λ (0) -λ (0) = 0\n(12)\nIsotope N1 still follows a standard exponential decay solution:\nN1 (t) = N0e-2λt\n(13)\n\nNext, let's plot when the amount of isotope N2 reaches its maximum, or in other words, when dN2\ndt = 0:\ndN2\ndt\n= 0 = λN1 -2λN2\n(14)\nλN1 = 2λN2\n(15)\nTherefore the curve for isotope N2 reaches its maximum when its value is half that of N1 at the same time.\nIt will then decay steadily afterwards, trending towards zero.\nFinally, let's try seeing when N3 reaches its peak (zero slope):\ndN3\ndt\n= 0 = λN2 -λN3; N2 = N3\n(16)\nThis means that N3 will peak as it intersects the curve for N2.\nYou should also draw that N2 and N3 should be allowed to build up somewhat, as this system of equations\nis not in either limiting case of λ2 ≪λ1 or λ2 ≫λ1.\nBelow is an example of what the graph should look like:\nand here is what the curve would have looked like if it were not in the reactor:\nFinally, mass doesn't appear to be conserved because the neutron burning going on in the reactor is\ntransmuting our isotopes into others which we're not tracking. Energy is always conserved, just not in the\nform of only these three isotopes in this case!\n\nFor reference, here is the generalized form of the solutions to these equations as compactly as possible,\nas described by the original Harry Bateman himself back in 1910:\nNn (t) = N10\nn-1\nY\ni=1\nλi\n!\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\ne-λit\nnQ\nj=1;j=i\n(λj -λi)\n\n(17)\nBonus Question (15 points) - The sun has a power of roughly 4 × 1026 W,\npowered by a chain of hydrogen fusion reactions, simplied as follows\n1H =⇒21\n1H +4\n2 He + 2β+ + 2ν + 2γ;\nQ = 20 MeV\n(18)\nEstimate, to an order of magnitude, how many neutrinos enter you\nper second coming from the sun. Assume you subtend a solid angle\nof 2 × 10-24 Sr (steradians) from the center of the sun.\nThis is a two-step problem, both involving units.

Next, we take the solid angle\nsubtended by us, and divide by the unit surface area of the sun.

Why do you say\nso?\nShort answer: Iron ions.\nExplanation: Let's look at how the stopping formula scales with the two things that dier here: (1) ion\nmass and (2) ion atomic number. The useful formulas below give you the electronic stopping power and the\nelectronic/nuclear stopping power ratios, which you'll have to put together:\n-dT\ndx ioniz. = 4πk2\n0NZ2\n1Z2e4\nc\nmev2\nln\n2mev2\nI\n\n;\n-\ndT\ndx\n\nioniz.\n-\ndT\ndx\n\nnucl.\n= 2M\nmeZ\nln\n\nγeEi\nI\n\nln\n\nγEi\nEd\n\n(1)\nLet's strip these down to the two things we care about: ion mass and ion atomic number. We can ditch the\nstu in the natural log because it doesn't vary very quickly, forget all the constants which are identical, and\nthrow the big-Z on top to get the relative scaling relations:\n-dT\ndx nucl. ∝Z2\nM\n(2)\nHere you can see that nuclear stopping scales with atomic number squared, but only linearly with ion mass.\nTherefore the bigger the Z of the ion, the more damaging it will be, even accounting for the fact that 1 kg of\niron ions contains a factor of A fewer ions than 1 kg of protons.\n\n1.2\nUsing the two-group neutron criticality relation, predict what will happen\nto keff of a pure 239Pu sphere which, after falling back to Earth upon a\nfailed launch and heating up during re-entry, falls into an ice-cold region of\nthe ocean. Just arrows on terms and justications will do.\nkeff =\n\nνfΣff + νthΣfth\n\nΣsf→th\nDthB2g+Σath\n\nΣsf→th + Σaf + DfB2g\nShort answer: keff should go up because of (1) neutron reection back into the sphere and (2) increased\nneutron moderation.\nExplanation: Let's see what will change in each term of the equation. First, Σfth will go waaaay up\nbecause the neutrons will lose energy from moderation, and most ssile fuels love slow neutrons. That also\nis a part of absorption, so some of the thermal absorption will also go up, but at the same time thermal\nleakage\nDthB2\ng\n\nwill go down from the water reection so that stu in the denominator will partly cancel\nitself out. Finally, the scattering from the fast to thermal energy group Σsf→th will go way up due to the\nwater on the outside, further increasing the ssion rate. And even though that same Σsf→th term is on the\nbottom of the whole equation, it's multiplied by νthΣfth on the top so its contribution is much more powerful\nthere. Therefore, the net eect is to increase criticality.\n[⇑keff] =\n\nνfΣff + νth\n\n⇑Σfth\n\n⇑Σsf→th\n↓[DthB2g]+↑Σath\n\n⇑Σsf→th+ ↑Σaf+ ↓\n\nDfB2g\n\n1.3\nFor the following photon spectrum, explain the physical origin(s) of each\nvisible feature in terms of photon interactions.\n... and ...\n1.4\nFor the photon spectrum above, continue drawing what you would expect\nthe spectrum to look like between 2000-3000 keV, based on what you can\ninfer about the spectrum from the 0-2000 keV data.\n\n1.5\nSet up, but do not solve, a system of equations which quanties the amount\nof 60Co one would have as a function of time, by starting with a mass M59\nof 59Co in a nuclear reactor with a neutron ux Φ. Dene any symbols you\nneed to complete the equation. How do you determine the optimum time\nto harvest your 60Co?\nWe'll just have to set up the series decay equations, assuming we put in stable 59Co and it absorbs neutrons\nto make 60Co:\ndN59\ndt\n= -σγ59ΦN59\n(3)\ndN60\ndt\n= σγ59ΦN59 -(λ60 + σγ60Φ) N60\n(4)\nWe'll also have to convert from a starting mass of 59Co to get our initial value of the number of atoms of\n59Co:\nN59 (t = 0) = M59NAv\nMM59\n(5)\nwhere NAv is Avogadro's number in atoms\nmol\nand MM59 is the molar mass of 59Co in\ng\nmol. Finally we recognize\nthat we'll have a maximum of 60Co when its derivative is zero:\ndN60\ndt\n= 0 = σγ59ΦN59 -(λ60 + σγ60Φ) N60\n(6)\nσγ59ΦN59 = (λ60 + σγ60Φ) N60\n(7)\nThat's as far as you have to go!\n1.6\nDraw an approximate sketch of the energy deposition as a function of depth,\nresulting from a proton beam entering a human skull and stopping at a\ntumor at the center of the brain. Model this as a two-layer system (bone-\nbrain).\nI'll use SRIM to make this easier to follow. I'm also including a screenshot of the SRIM setup which produces\nthis result. Any sketch which gets the following main points will get full credit:\n1. Bone is denser and has calcium (the heaviest element in the way), so its stopping power should be\nhigher than the subsequent brain tissue.\n2. The energy deposition should have a Bragg peak at the end of range of the tumor, after which the\nenergy deposition should drastically drop o.\n(c) SRIM.org. All rights reserved.

Assuming\nthe drone swarm starts as a sphere at the origin (of our arbitrary coordinate\nsystem), and it thinks it detects a photon coming somewhere from the\n+z direction, draw the ideal shape in which the swarm should rearrange\nitself to maximize the likelihood of further Compton scatter detections\ncoming from the same direction.\nUse the Klein-Nishina angular photon\ncross section formula to guide your answer.\nShort Answer: Draw a cone pointing in the +z direction.\nExplanation: The Klein-Nishina cross section, which describes the likelihood of Compton scattering into\ndierent angles as a function of energy, predicts forward scattering as by far the most likely possibility.\nTherefore, if the swarm thinks there is a source in the +z direction, arranging itself into a thin cone with its\nvertex pointing towards +z will maximize the likelihood of catching those forward-scattered Compton photons.\n(c) World Scientific Publishing Co.

Also take into account how to\nshield the detector operator from all forms of radiation present,\nwho would be standing behind the detector. Assume the radia-\ntion source is in front of the detector, and the operator is standing\nbehind it as a shield. You can use any combination of materials\nwhich you would like.\nFast neutrons are notoriously dicult to shield or catch, because all the cross sections are so low. However,\nthey can be moderated to become slow neutrons, at which point a highly absorbing thermal neutron medium\ncould catch them and function as the detector medium. The only other thing to mention is that the detector\nwill require some sort of voltage to accelerate the ions created by neutron absorption into a current, which\nsome system of electronics can count as charge proportional to fast neutron ux.\nFor shielding, the neutrons if properly and fully moderated won't pose an issue themselves, nor will the\nelectrons, as both will be totally stopped in the detector moderator/absorber medium. However, neutrons\ncan create many long-lived activation products which release gamma rays upon decay, and high-energy\nelectrons can release lots of bremsstrahlung x-rays which must be shielded, just like the high and low-energy\nphotons, respectively. Therefore, you'll want a thick/dense/high-Z enough shield behind this detector to\nattenuate a large enough fraction of these photons so as not to damage the operator. How much, exactly,\nwe will do in the next section.\nThe following crude MS Paint sketch demonstrates a minimum drawing to receive full credit on this half\nof the problem:\n(c) Source unknown.

For more information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use.\n\n(15 points) Next, make it quantitative: Assume that you want to\nshield the operator from 99% of all the radiation which would be\npresent in front of the detector, assuming the operator is standing\nbehind it. Assume uxes of Φnhigh-E, Φnlow-E, Φe-\nhigh-E, Φe-\nlow-E, Φγhigh-E,\nΦγlow-E. Set up, but do not solve, the equations which would allow\nyou to determine the thicknesses of the detector layers to ensure at\nleast 99% shielding from each and every form of radiation.\nLet's start with the easiest one - the electrons! Because they are charged particles, we simply need to make\nsure that the range of the rst layer (the neutron moderating layer) will exceed the range of the electrons\nin that medium. This will both shield the user from the electrons and stop them from aecting the fast\nneutron signal. We use the range equation to determine this, which is the integral of the inverse of the total\nstopping power:\nRange =\nEi\nZ\n-\ndT\ndx\n-1\ntotal\n;\nxmoderator > Range\n(8)\nWe also note that the total stopping power is the sum of the electronic, nuclear, and radiative contributions:\ndT\ndx\n\ntotal\n=\ndT\ndx\n\nelec.\n+\ndT\ndx\n\nnucl.\n+\ndT\ndx\n\nbrem.\n(9)\nand the electronic stopping power, plus the ratios between it and the other two types, are in the Useful\nFormulas section below. Therefore this part is done.\nNext, let's do the neutrons.\nWe recall that we can write that neutrons are attenuated using their\nmacroscopic total cross section Σt, in a very similar way as for photons:\nΦn (x) = Φn0e-Σtx\n(10)\nHowever, we do not know whether the rst moderating layer will eectively stop all the low-energy neutrons,\nand we know it will create more via fast neutron moderation. Thus we need to make sure the thickness of\nthe highly absorbing, neutron detecting layer combined with the moderating layer is thick enough to stop\nat least 99% of all fast neutrons coming in with the following two equations:\nΦn,fast (xmoderator + xdetector)\nΦn,fast (0)\n≤0.01;\n0.01 =\n\ne-Σt,moderator(Ehigh)xmoderator\n\ne-Σt,detector(Ehigh)xdetector\n\n(11)\nHere we note that we multiply the two attenuating factors, because whatever fraction of neutrons make\nit through the moderator layer\ne-Σt,moderator(Ehigh)xmoderator\nmust be further cut down by the detector\nlayer\ne-Σt,detector(Ehigh)xdetector\nsuch that the multiple of these fractions is less than 0.01, representing\n99% attenuation. We also note that moderation (elastic scattering) is part of the total cross section, thus\nmoderation is accounted for. The same equation applies for the slow neutrons... except that we are creating\nTONS of extra slow neutrons by moderating the fast ones! Therefore, to be on the safe side, we need to\nmake sure that the attenuation of only the detector layer will catch at least 99% of all slow neutrons which\nenter it:\nΦn,slow (xmoderator + xdetector)\nΦn,slow (xmoderator)\n≤0.01;\n0.01 =\n\ne-Σt,detector(Elow)xdetector\n\n(12)\nThis both ensures that the detector acts as a good shield for slow neutrons and captures at least 99% of\nthem to turn them into signal. To nish o the neutrons, we need to estimate the fraction of extra slow\nneutrons created in the moderator layer, which we can do with the scattering cross section Σs (Ehigh):\nΦn,slow (xmoderator) =\nunattenuated slow neutrons\nz\n}|\n{\nΦn,slow (0)\n\ne-Σt,moderator(Eslow)xmoderator\n\n+\nnewly created slow neutrons\nz\n}|\n{\nΦn,fast (0)\n\ne-Σs,moderator(Efast)xmoderator\n\n(13)\n\nLet's not worry about neutrons scattering in many directions, as (1) we'll assume this is an 1D problem and\n(2) that gives us an assumption in the conservative direction.\nFinally, let's think about the photons. Neutron capture in the rst two layers can create more photons of\nboth energies, and we need to make the nal shield thick enough to attenuate 99% of both photons coming\nfrom the radiation source and those generated by nuclear reactions in the rst two layers. We'll set up\nequations just like the neutron ones, except with an extra layer where things can be created, both from\nelectron bremsstrahlung and neutron nuclear reactions.\nΦγ,fast (xmoderator + xdetector + xshield)\nΦγ,fast (0)\n≤0.01\n(14)\n0.01 =\n\ne-μt,moderator(Ehigh)xmoderator\n\ne-μt,detector(Ehigh)xdetector\n\ne-μt,shield(Ehigh)xshield\n\n(15)\nΦγ,low (xmoderator) =\nunattenuated low-E photons\nz\n}|\n{\nΦγ,low (0)\n\ne-μt,moderator(Elow)xmoderator\n\ne-μt,detector(Elow)xdetector\n\n(16)\n+\nnewly created photons from fast neutrons\nz\n}|\n{\nΦn,fast (0)\nh\ne-Σ(n,γ),moderator(Efast)xmoderator\n\n+\n\ne-Σ(n,γ),detector(Efast)xdetector\ni\n+\nnewly created photons from slow neutrons\nz\n}|\n{\nΦn,slow (0)\nh\ne-Σ(n,γ),moderator(Eslow)xmoderator\n\n+\n\ne-Σ(n,γ),detector(Eslow)xdetector\ni\n+\nnewly created photons from fast electrons\nz\n}|\n{\nΦe-,fast (0)\n\" dT\ndx brem\ndT\ndx total\n# brem. photons\nfast electron\n\nYou don't need to give an expression for the last part per se since we didn't give you any formulas, just a\nunit analysis will do.\n\nUseful Formulas\n∆λ =\nh\nmec (1 -cosθ)\nTe-= hν -hν′ = hν\n1 -cosθ\nmec2\nhν\n+ 1 -cosθ\nI = I0e-( μ\nρ )ρx = I0e-Σx\ndσC\ndΩ= k2\n0e4\n2m2ec4\nν′\nν\n2 ν\nν′ + ν′\nν -sin2θ\n\n-dT\ndx = 4πk2\n0NZ2\n1Z2e4\nc\nmev2\nln\n2mev2\nI\n\n= 2πk2\n0NZ2\n1Z2e4\nc\nEi\nmion\nme\nln\nγeEi\nI\n\n; γe =\n4meM\n(M + me)2\n-\ndT\ndx\n\nioniz.\n-\ndT\ndx\n\nnucl.\n= 2M\nmeZ\nln\n\nγeEi\nI\n\nln\n\nγEi\nEd\n;\nγ =\n4mM\n(m + M)2\n-\ndT\ndx\n\nrad.\n-\ndT\ndx\n\nioniz.\n=\nme\nM\nZEi\n1400mec2\n\nRange =\nEi\nZ\n-\ndT\ndx\n-1\nv\ndφ (r, E, Ω, t)\ndt\n= χ (E)\n4π\nZ\nV\nZ\nE′\nZ\nΩ′\nd3rdE′dΩ′ν (E′) Σf (E′) φ (r, E′, Ω′, t)\n+S0 (r, E, Ω, t) +\nZ\nV\nZ\nE′\nZ\nΩ′\nd3rdEdΩ′Σs (E′) φ (r, E′, Ω′, t) F (E′ →E, Ω′ →Ω)\n-\nZ\nV\nd3rdEdΩΣt (E) φ (r, E, Ω, t) -\nZ\nV\nd3rdEdΩΩ· ∇φ (r, E, Ω, t)\nΣ =\nEmax\nR\nΣ (E) Φ (E) dE\nEmax\nR\nΦ (E) dE\nB2\nmaterial = νΣf -Σa\nD\nB2\ng =\nπ\naex\nor\nν1\nRex\n+\nπ\nH\n!\nor\nπ\nRex\nΣaΦ -D∇2Φ = νΣfΦ\nkeff\n=⇒\nΣaΦ -DB2Φ = νΣfΦ\nkeff\n=⇒\nkeff =\nνΣf\nΣa + DB2\n-∇2Φ\nΦ\n= B2\ngeometry;\n, Φ (x) = A cos (Bgx) + G sin (Bgx) in Cartesian coordinates\nkeff =\n\nνfΣff + νthΣfth\n\nΣsf→th\nDthB2\ng+Σath\n\nΣsf→th + Σaf + DfB2g\nQ = 0 = Tf\n\n1 + 1\nA\n\n-Ti\n\n1 -1\nA\n\n-2\nA\np\nTiTfcosθ (17)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n22.01 Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Ionizing Radiation\nSpring 2024\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

This would be consistent with the\nevidence that oxidative metabolism is upregulated in bystander\ncells (Azzam et al., 2002; Narayanan et al., 1997), and has led to the\nhypothesis that the point mutations are a result of oxidative base\ndamage occurring in bystander cells (Huo et al., 2001).\n(c) Elsevier Inc.

Conclusions: implications for low-dose cancer risk\n(73) Epidemiological data from studies of human populations exposed to IR provide\ndirect evidence that such exposure is associated with increased risk of cancer,\nand reason to believe that excess risk is not confined to people exposed to very high\nradiation doses. Our knowledge of radiation-related risk is highly quantified, more\nso than for any other common environmental carcinogen, and we have learned much\nabout factors that modify that risk. Our understanding of risks associated with doses\ncommonly encountered in daily life is not insignificant; we know, for example, that\nsuch risks are far lower than those observed in populations exposed to hundreds or\nthousands of mGy. However, the problem of quantifying risks that are so low as to\nbe practically unobservable, and then recommending policies based on that\nquantification, is very difficult.\n(74) It is highly likely that there will always be uncertainty about the risk of low\ndoses, and that we will have to come to terms with that uncertainty. One way to\ndo that is to quantify the uncertainty in a manner consistent with mainstream scientific\ninformation, and to evaluate actions and policies in terms of plausible probability\ndistributions of risks associated with these actions and policies.\n(c) Elsevier Inc.

Trottet. Space Science Reviews 95: 215-225, 2001\nAbstract\nWe review evidence that led to the view that acceleration at shock waves driven\nby coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is responsible for large particle events\ndetected at 1 AU. It appears that even if the CME bow shock acceleration is a possible\nmodel for the origin of rather low energy ions, it faces difficulties on account of the\nproduction of ions far above 1 MeV: (i) although shock waves have been demonstrated\nto accelerate ions to energies of some MeV nucl-1 in the interplanetary medium, their\nability to achieve relativistic energies in the solar environment is unproven; (ii) SEP\nevents producing particle enhancements at energies 100 MeV are also accompanied\nby flares; those accompanied only by fast CMEs have no proton signatures above 50\nMeV. We emphasize detailed studies of individual high energy particle events which\nprovide strong evidence that time-extended particle acceleration which occurs in\nthe corona after the impulsive flare contributes to particle fluxes in space. It\nappears thus that the CME bow shock scenario has been overvalued and that\nlong lasting coronal energy release processes have to be taken into account\nwhen searching for the origin of high energy SEP events.\n22.01 - Intro to Ionizing Radiation\nBackground Radiation, Slide 68\n\n22.01 - Intro to Ionizing Radiation\nDose, Dosimetry, & Background, Slide 69\nMaking Cosmogenic Nuclides\n- Protons enter the atmosphere\n- Spallation occurs, releasing neutrons\n- Neutrons combine with key nuclides to produce 3H, 14C\n- 14N(n,p)14C\n- 14N(n,3H)12C\n\nSpallation Sources on Earth\nhttp://pd.chem.ucl.ac.uk/pdnn/inst3/pulsed.htm\n(p,n) reactions are called\nspallation reactions\n(c) Birkbeck College, University of London.

Read the two papers on the Canvas site, \"Possible Existence of a\nNeutron\" and \"The Existence of a Neutron,\" and answer the following questions.\n1. What made James first hypothesize an uncharged particle with the mass of a proton?\n2. What was the competing hypothesis to explain the observed results?\n3. Write the nuclear reaction of alpha particles (helium nuclei) bombarding beryllium. You may want to\nlook up the stable isotope of Be here: https://pripyat.mit.edu/KAERI/\n4. Why would a neutron have greater \"penetrating power\" (range) through matter compared to charged\nparticles? What does a neutron not interact with?\n5. On p. 694 of the second paper, Chadwick states that \"The source of polonium was prepared from a\nsolution of radium by deposition on a disc of silver.\" How could polonium be produced directly from\nradium? Look at the KAERI Table of Nuclides (MIT local mirror) or the IAEA Chart for clues, using\n224Ra. Click on \"Decay Radiation\" and \"Daughters\" for the IAEA chart.\n6. On p. 698 of the second paper, Chadwick states that \"the mass of the neutron is equal to that of the\nproton...\" Is this true? What are the masses of the proton, neutron, and electron? Is the mass of\nRutherford's \"neutron,\" consisting of a proton and an electron, equal to the neutron's mass? Why or\nwhy not (where does the energy discrepancy come from)? Why couldn't Chadwick discern between\nthe masses of these two particles?\n7. On pp. 701-702, why is the kinetic energy of 11B not accounted for, and what does it mean for kinetic\nenergies to be given in \"mass units?\" Convert these \"mass unit\" energies to energies in electron volts\n(eV). What is the approximate kinetic energy of 11B in eV at room temperature?\n\n(65 points) Getting Used to Nuclear Quantities\nIn these questions, you will calculate a number of quantities related to nuclear reactions and power genera\ntion. You will have to look up certain reactions and values from primary sources in the literature (books,\npapers, databases). Try starting from a place like Web of Science (available from the MIT Libraries at\nhttps://libraries.mit.edu/) instead of Google or worse. As we saw in class, the internet is rife with misinfor\nmation and rounding errors. Make sure to state which values you look up or assume, and cite your sources\nusing proper citation methods.\nThese calculations are useful, especially when arguing the benefits and costs of nuclear power. If you can\nderive them quickly and by yourselves, you don't have to rely on as many other sources of information to\nmake your point.\n2.1\nRelative Power Densities and Nuclear Reactions (25 points)\nLearning Objective: These problems will get you used to calculating order-of-magnitude energy releases from\nchemical and nuclear reactions, so you can compare them and see why we want to use nuclear power in the\nfirst place.\nCalculate the energy in Joules released from burning (oxidizing) 1kg of coal, natural gas, uranium,\nand deuterium. Use the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, available through the MIT Libraries\nf\nsite, to find chemical binding energies (otherwise known as enthalpies of formation, or ΔH0 ) data for your\nanswers. Now repeat this calculation for the nuclear fission of uranium into 90Sr and 145Xe (two typical\nfission products), and the nuclear fusion of 2H with 3H. Use the KAERI or IAEA Table of Nuclides (link\non the Canvas site) to find the nuclear binding energies for your answers. Neglect electrons entirely for\nsimplicity. To summarize the quantities we're looking for:\n1. Energy in Joules from oxidizing 1kg of coal. You'll need to find & cite the percentage of carbon in\ncoal.\n2. Energy in Joules from oxidizing 1kg of natural gas (assuming it's pure methane, CH4)\n3. Energy in Joules from chemically oxidizing 1kg of uranium metal\n4. Energy in Joules from chemically oxidizing 1kg of deuterium gas\n5. Energy in Joules from nuclear fission of 1kg of 235U (you will have to pick two fission products plus\n2-3 neutrons)\n6. (5 points) Energy in Joules from nuclear fusion of 500g of 2H and 500g of 3H. Hint: One of these will\nbe a limiting reagent.\n2.2\n(40 points) Excess Mass and Binding Energy\nLearning Objective: These problems will drill you in calculating and verifying nuclear binding energies, test\nyour knowledge of the meaning of excess mass, and teach you how to use computer tools to automate tedious\ncalculations if you don't already know how to do so.\nFor these problems, you'll be verifying a few quantities from the Table of Nuclides by hand, and explain\ning what they mean. That means the answers are in the Table of Nuclides, you just have to show where\nthey come from and why. Consider the the isotopes of fluorine ranging from 16F to 22F, and the isotopes\n29Cu to 68\nof copper ranging from 60\n29Cu. It is highly suggested to use a spreadsheet like Excel or Gnumeric to\nhelp complete these problems, to avoid lots of tedious writing and calculator punching. If you do, then be\nsure to upload your spreadsheet of calculations to the Canvas site, or export the page as an image/PDF.\nOtherwise we can't give you partial credit!\n1) Using the isotopes of fluorine, explain what the excess mass (Δ) physically represents, and why it is\nalmost always positive. Why/when is it negative, and what does a negative excess mass physically mean?\n\n2) Verify the stated values of excess mass and binding energy using nothing but the stated masses in\namu, and the numbers and individual masses of the protons, neutrons, and electrons present.\n29Cu to 68\nIt is highly suggested to use a\nNext, consider the the isotopes of copper ranging from 60\n29Cu.\nspreadsheet like Excel or Gnumeric to help complete these problems, to avoid lots of tedious writing and\ncalculator punching. If you do, then be sure to upload your spreadsheet of calculations to the Canvas site,\nor export the page as an image/PDF. Otherwise we can't give you partial credit!\n3) Calculate the Q-value (energy gained or lost) for each of the above isotopes absorbing a neutron, via\nthe following nuclear reaction: A\n0 n -→A+1 Cu + Q. Is each reaction exothermic or endothermic, and\n29Cu +1\nhow do you know?\n\nBE(A,Z)\n4) Plot the binding energy per nucleon\nvs. the natural log of the half life ln t1/2\nof each\nA\ncopper isotope. Is there a pattern, and do you see any significant deviations?

Confirm that\nyour estimates of the shell levels are correct, by looking up their energy transitions in the NIST x-ray\nenergy transition database.\n3. Why does the pair production cross section become non-zero abruptly at energies above ~ω = 2mec2?\n4. Explain why it is more likely to see a single-escape pair production peak from a large NaI detector,\nwhile it is more likely to see a double-escape pair production peak from a small semiconductor detector.\n1.2 (12 points) Compton Scattering Calculations\nLearning Objective: Use the Klein-Nishina cross section and Compton scattering formulas to calculate photon\nscattering quantities.\n1.

Choose a lead apron thickness to shield dental patients from 90% of the x-rays emitted from a pure\n40 kV x-ray source. Do you have to consider any additional x-rays produced in the lead, and if so,\naccount for this in your calculations.\n2. Explain the qualitative di erences in the attenuation coeycients of lithium and tungsten in a quanti\ntative manner, at the following energies: Eγ < 100keV, Eγ = 1MeV, Eγ = 100MeV. By this, we mean\ncompare relative values of the relevant scattering cross sections, and explain any discrepancies between\nthese and the relative values of the attenuation coeycients.\n3.

Only consider gamma rays with at least a 50% intensity.\n(40 points) Noodle-Scratchers (team write-ups OK, as long as\neveryone typesets their own)\n2.1 Unknown Gamma Spectral Identification (Answer not given... yet)\nLearning Objective: Identify and quantify an unknown gamma spectrum resulting from neutron activation\nanalysis (NAA).\nUsing the NAA spectra obtained in the MIT nuclear reactor and HPGe detector, and the table of potential\nisotopes for \"Longs\" analysis on the Canvas site, identify/label this gamma spectrum resulting from NAA\nof a local apple seed, and calculate the amounts of observed isotopes in parts per million weight (ppmw)\nof each isotope knowing that the seed weighed 89.78 mg. You will want to use external databases to help\nyou search, such as the Gamma Search database and the KAERI tables. Label every significant peak you\nfind on the spectrum itself (you must sort out what is a \"true peak\"), and note the mechanistic origins\nof each. Also label locations where you would have expected peaks, and explain why you don't see them.\nAssume this sample was in the MIT nuclear reactor for a period of one hour with a thermal neutron flux of\nn\nΦ = 1014\n(Eneutrons = 0.025 eV), and that one day elapsed between activation and counting.\ncm2s\nTo solve this problem in steps, you'll need to perform the following:\n1. Identify the peaks in the gamma spectrum as we did together in class.\n\n2. For each significant peak, convert from a number of counts (the raw data, Net Peak Area) to radioac\ntivity in Bq.\n3. Compute how much of that isotope must have existed immediately after removal from the MIT reactor,\nnoting it had been decaying for one day.\n4. Work backwards to figure out how much of the original isotope had to exist to explain your quantity\nin (3).\n(a) You can model this as a series decay problem, where the original isotope (let's say 23Na for\nexample) underwent neutron capture (n, γ) to become 24Na. This time, instead of knowing N10\nof 23Na at the start, you know the quantity N2 (t = 3, 600 sec) instead.\n(b) Here your \"e ective λ\" values should include both their natural decay (for N2 only (here 24Na))\nand their burning, or artificial decay (for all isotopes).\n(c) Also account for burning of isotope N2 (here 24Na) while it's still in the reactor. Use JANIS to\nfind (n, absorption) cross sections where you can, and assume a value of 1 barn when the data is\nnot available. Use the most recent ENDF library for your cross sections.\n5. Finally, now that you can solve for N10 of each isotope, convert from number of atoms to weight, and\ndivide by the apple seed mass to get concentration in ppmw.\nI strongly suggest implementing this numerically, so once you've got a formula, you can just put each isotope's\nnet counts, decay constant, and cross sections in a formula or spreadsheet to compute things for you.\n2.2 Compton Scattering Derivation Practice (answer given)\nLearning Objective: This problem will develop your ability to derive quantities from a pure physical model,\nusing the two-particle kinematics derivation from class as an example.\nUsing photon energy and momentum relations, derive the formula for the Compton wavelength shift (Δλ)\np\nas a function of θ. Use the fact that the momentum of an electron can be expressed as cp =\nT (T + 2me c2 )\n(NOTE: There are two possible approaches: (1) Conserve x-momentum, y-momentum, and\n\ntotal energy T + mec , and (2) conserve total momentum and kinetic/photon energies.

Consider the following electron microscope image of Zoe's earring from the streets of Milan:\nWhere is the gold in this image, and how do you know, based on your knowledge of electron interaction\nmechanisms with matter? Back up your answer with a relevant quantitative estimate of electron\ninteractions.\n\n3. Using an image processing program (such as GIMP, ImageJ, or others), measure the relative bright\nnesses of various types of spots in the images. Hint: In GIMP, use the Colors→Info→Histogram\nmenu to get brightness histograms of selected regions. Can you guess the average atomic number of\neach of the spots? In other words, is brightness linearly proportional to the type of electron interac\ntion(s) that you are interested in?\n4. Explain, using photon attenuation and proton stopping power, why protons are far more e ective at\ndamaging a localized tumor. Draw any applicable range relations and/or attenuation graphs to make\nyour point.\n1.2\nNumerical Problems (5 points each)\nLearning Objective: These problems will drill your ability to calculate stopping powers analytically, allowing\nyou to check your work with a NIST-standard database. They also ask you to explain a few intuitive quantities\nin your own words.\n1. Calculate and graph (hopefully using a spreadsheet) the electronic stopping power of protons in lead\nvs. their energy, over a range between 10 keV and 1,000 MeV in half orders of magnitude (10 keV,\n33 keV, 100 keV, 333 keV ...). You can check your work using the PSTAR Stopping Power and\nRange Tables for Protons. Ignore any relativistic e ects.\n2. Calculate and graph the ratio of bremsstrahlung stopping power to the electronic stopping power for\nthe cases above, as a function of energy. At what energy would radiative (bremsstrahlung) stopping\nbecome the dominant mechanism of energy loss for protons in lead? Ignore any relativistic e ects.\n3. Calculate and graph the ratio of nuclear stopping power vs. electronic stopping power for the cases\nabove, as a function of energy. At what energy would nuclear stopping become the dominant mechanism\nof energy loss for protons in lead? Ignore any relativistic e ects.\n4. (15 points) Using your answers above, develop (by hand, or using a spreadsheet) a graph of the range\nof protons in lead, by combining your three stopping powers into a total stopping power, fitting a simple\nfunction to it, and using the relationship between stopping power and range. Check your answers by\nusing the PSTAR Stopping Power and Range Tables for Protons. What, if any, discrepancies do you\nsee?\n(50 points) Noodle-Scratchers\nLearning Objective: Using all your accumulated knowledge of charged particle stopping and photon interac\ntions in detectors, re-create the true x-ray spectrum emitted from a material in an electron microscope, which\nis not what shows up on the screen during analysis.\nFor this question, consider the scanning electron microscope (SEM) which we demonstrated in lab last\nFriday.

(15 points) Develop and graph a theoretically predicted photon emission spectrum when\noperating this SEM, in other words, what you expect to see shown on the screen. Here,\nconsider the x-ray spectrum produced at the characteristic x-ray interaction region.\n2.

      "content": "22.01 Fall 2019, Problem Set 7\nComplete all the assigned problems, and do make sure to show your intermediate work.\n(70 points) Skill Building Problems\n1.1\n(40 points) Radiation Damage in Metals\nLearning Objective: These problems will help you understand radiation damage from the incoming particles\nto the end of defect creation. Understanding an individual radiation damage event is important for studying\nnuclear materials, since it is the accumulation of these events that leads to the property change of materials\nunder irradiation.\nConsider the case of a 3 MeV proton entering lead, and answer following questions with the help from\nthe slides on the LMOD website.\n1. (10 points) Describe what physical processes the proton may encounter as it enters into lead (how the\nproton loses its energy). Qualitatively draw the average energy of the protons versus the depth into\nlead. Which interaction mechanism is dominating at the beginning? At the end?\n2. (3 points each)ν(T ) is a parameter describing how many displacements a PKA (primary knock-on\natom) with initial energy T produces on average. Ed is the displacement threshold energy, and is the\nminimum energy needed to displace a lattice atom. In class, you were given the Kinchin-Pease model\nas the following equation and graph. A few assumptions were made in describing this model. Now you\nare going to look more closely at those assumptions and see whether they are reasonable.\nFigure 1: Kinchin-Pease model equation and graph.\n\n(a) First assumption: \"The cascade is created by a sequence of two-body elastic collisions between\natoms.\" Is this always the case? Will ν(T ) be bigger or smaller after relaxing this assumption?\n(b) Second assumption: \"The displacement probability is 1 for T bigger than Ed\". Treating Ed as the\nthreshold energy to cause one displacement, is this assumption true for room temperature and\nabove? When will this be true?\n(c) Third assumption: \"When an atom with initial energy T emerges from a collision with energy T'\nand generates a new recoil with energy ε, it is assumed that no energy passes to the lattice and\nT = T' + ε\". It is apparent that energy is not conserved in this assumption, what is the missing\nterm? Will ν(T ) be bigger or smaller after correcting this energy conservation?\n(d) Fourth assumption: \"Energy loss by electron stopping is given by a cuto energy Ec. If the PKA\nenergy is greater than Ec, no additional displacements occur until electron energy losses reduce the\nPKA energy to Ec. For all energies less than Ec, electronic stopping is ignored, and only atomic\ncollisions occur.\" Is this true? What will happen when you correctly relax this assumption?\n(e) Draw a suggested, updated curve for ν (T ), relaxing the assumptions above. Label each change\nyou make and just a 1-4 words describing each changed feature.\n3. (15 points) We have learned that the displacements calculated using the K-P model are more than\nthe actual point defects produced. To correct this, we simply multiplied the DPA equation with a\ncorrection term ξ, which is called \"displacement eyciency.\" Researchers have put a lot of e orts to\nimprove the accuracy of DPA calculation. Briefly go through this recent Nature Communications\npaper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03415-5. What have the authors presented as a\ncorrection of the NRT-dpa model? Briefly explain them and the advantages of them over the NRT-dpa\nmodel. (Can you sense what they are trying to do to make the damage calculation better at predicting\nor linking to macroscopic material property change?)\n1.2\n(30 points) Neutronics and Criticality\n1.2.1 MIT Reactor Modifications (15 points)\nLearning Objective: Intuitively discover what would happen to a nuclear reactor if certain changes were made\nduring critical operation. Discover relationships between variables in the criticality relation.\nFor these questions, consider the MIT reactor in its critical state, and the various experiments that we\ndo with it. >>>Here<<< is a cross section of the relevant parts of the MIT reactor. What would be the\nnet e ect of each of the following changes on the reactor's criticality, and which of the terms in the one\nenergy group criticality relation would be a ected? Explain why, using your knowledge of neutron\nabsorption and leakage, and how they a ect criticality.\n(a) Passing silicon through the reactor to dope with phosphorus by transmutation (this really happens)\n(b) Throwing quarters directly in the core of the reactor like a wishing well (this actually happened!)\n(c) Closing all the beam ports which let neutrons out for experiments\n(d) Raising the temperature of the coolant\n(e) Increasing the enrichment of the fuel\n1.2.2 Criticality Calculations (15 points)\nLearning Objective: Actually calculate the physical size of critical reactor geometries, and find real cross\nsection data on the JANIS database.\n- (5 points) Using the one energy group criticality relation and cross section values taken at 2 MeV,\ncalculate the radius of a perfectly critical sphere of 239Pu surrounded by vacuum.\n- (10 points) Develop a two energy group criticality relation (fast (f) and thermal (th) energy groups) in\nterms of only material properties & geometry, and use it to calculate the critical radius of a balloon\nfilled with 235UF6. Assume the 235UF6 is stored at a density of 1 kg\nYou can simply pick average\n3 .\nm\nvalues in the fast (>1eV) and thermal (<1eV) energy regions, instead of doing any formal averaging.\n\n- HINT: First check that an infinite medium would at least be critical, before accounting for the\ngeometric buckling (physical size) of an enrichment plant.\nNoodle Scratchers (30 points)\nWill It Blend: AP-1000 Edition (30 points, answer not given)\nLearning Objective: Perform true flux-averaged cross section calculations on a spreadsheet, and decide\nwhether homogenizing a reactor which we know works would break it.\nRead the >>>AP-1000 spec sheet<<< p. 7-9. Assuming that the core is completely homogeneous\n(blended) mix of fuel, cladding, coolant (assume 28.25 m at 303.4C), and structural materials (assume\n5,920 kg), calculate the criticality (keff ) of the AP-1000 using homogeneous, two energy-group\nneutron di usion theory (two-group keff expression). What are the largest three factors which you believe\nmake your keff not equal to unity? Be specific about what each would do to the two group criticality.\nYou may assume that the core contains only four materials: coolant/moderator (H2O), fuel (UO2),\n\ncladding assume pure 90Zr , and structural materials assume pure 56Fe . Ignore control rods, assume\nthey are all out of the reactor during normal operation. Also ignore the reactor vessel or any other materials.\nYou will have to calculate flux-averaged cross sections considering each isotope, for each energy group.\nHints: You will have to take into account:\n\ng\n- Reactor operating temperature in Kelvin and density in\nof the materials in the reactor\ncm\n- Assume the fuel is 5% 235U. Neglect any other isotopic abundances per the problem statement.\n- Di erent di usion coeycients for the two energy groups\n- Perform your microscopic cross section averages using tabulated data from the ENDF/B-VII.1 cross\nsection database for incident neutrons. Note that you can export the data directly, so you can perform\nthe integrals in Excel or something similar, see the LMOD site for an example screenshot and an\nexample spreadsheet. Discretize the energy integral using any method you see fit. You will have to\n\nΦ(E)σ(E)dE\ncompute flux-averaged microscopic cross section averages as follows: σ =\n\nΦ(E)dE\n- Use the attached spreadsheet to obtain most of your values! I've done much of this\nwork for you. You'll just have to export/obtain the values for U-235, and compute\na couple of remaining values in yellow in the Final Calcs sheet.\n- Neglect photofission, (n, in) reactions, and anything else complicated\n- Use the flux profile on the LMOD site (which contains a cross section averaging template) to compute\nyour averaged macroscopic cross sections. Here is a plot of the flux spectrum:\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n22.01 Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Ionizing Radiation\nSpring 2024\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "22.01 Problem Set 8\nWhat's In Your Toenails? (20 points)\nUsing the same methodology as in Problem Set 5, figure out what's in your toenails! You can use the default spectrum\non the Canvas site if you don't have one of your own. Elements that we've noticed in some of the spectra include Cr,\nFe, Mn, As, and Au, but you may not see every element in every sample. You can use the same background spectra\nfrom Problem Set 5, and other useful information about each specimen and the overall irradiation is on the Canvas\nsite.\nForbidden Cookies (20 points)\nYou are given four cookies containing dangerous levels of a high-activity isotope. Each has the same half life, the\nsame concentration, and therefore the same activity. One emits alpha particles, one emits betas, one emits gammas,\nand one emits neutrons, all at the same energies. You must put one in your pocket, hold one in your hand, eat one,\nand give one to a \"friend.\" What do you do, and why? Use your knowledge of stopping power, range, and\nrelative biological e ectiveness (tissue and radiation quality factors) to explain.\nToasty Flights (20 points)\nHow many round-trip flights from Boston to Japan would you have to take to double your yearly background radiation\ndose? Take the BOS-NRT direct flight as your reference case. Use this handy FAA flight dose calculator to help you:\nhttp://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp\nSpooning (20 points)\nEstimate the additional dose incurred by spooning (see Figure 1), compared to sleeping alone, for eight hours.\nFigure 1: Spooning\n(c) Source unknown.

For more information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use.\n\nAnswer: About 0.01μSv (anything within a factor of two should be just fine)\nInciting Mass Panic with Data (20 points)\nUsing your Geiger counters, find the most radioactive, publicly accessible place wherever you happen to be. Each\nperson (or team of two people) should count at just 1-2 places. Be 95% confident in your measurement to within\n10% uncertainty, so we can compare in class! If you go to a public place, be sure to clear your short experiment with\nany local security, guards, or other oycials so you don't get anyone worried.\n\nHints for the Problems\nSpooning\nHere, you'll have to perform the following overall steps:\n1. Look up the concentrations of radioactive isotopes naturally present in the body. Assume that dogs are basically\nhumans.\n2. Decide which of those isotopes will release radiation which could be felt by the adjoining dog.\n3. Assume a rectangular, prismatic dog.\n4. Determine how much radiation each slice of Dog 1 irradiates Dog 2. Consider:\n(a) The solid angle of a slice of Dog 1's radiation towards Dog 2\n(b) The self-shielding of Dog 1, blocking its own radiation from getting to Dog 2\n(c) The amount of radiation coming out of each dog slice, which is actually absorbed by Dog 2\n5. Make sure the answer is in Sieverts, by accounting for the masses of the dogs, tissue quality factors, and\nradiation quality factors.\nKnowledge Brings Fear\n1. Use your knowledge (and the readings, and the lecture slides) to decide which building materials or altitudes\n(including negative altitudes) are most likely to harbor radioactive substances, more cosmic radiation, or higher\nlevels of radon. This will help you pick places to go.\n2. You'll have to consider the uncertainty on a counting rate experiment, and the time it takes to be 95% confident\nin that measurement to within an error of 10%. Assuming errors in any experiment are normally (Gaussian)\ndistributed, you can claim 68% confidence on a measured count rate plus/minus one standard deviation (σ) of\nthat count rate, and 95% confidence on 1.96σ. The standard deviation on a count rate (r) is defined as follows:\nr r\nσ =\n(1)\nt\nwhere (t) is the amount of time for which the measurement was counted. Therefore, you can estimate the time\nyou'll need to count to obtain 95% confidence on a 10% uncertain measurement, if you have a good guess of\nthe count rate:\nr r\n1.96σ = 1.96\n= 0.1r\n(2)\nt\nand solve for (t). You can run a short background experiment (just count in your room or wherever) to get a\ngood, first guess at (r).\n3. Divide and conquer for more locations! You can work in groups of up to two people, in case not everyone has\na working Geiger counter or an Android phone.\n4. Be safe and courteous! We don't have the class funds to bail anyone out of jail for sneaking into someplace you\nshouldn't be. Also, trespassing is wrong.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n22.01 Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Ionizing Radiation\nSpring 2024\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
