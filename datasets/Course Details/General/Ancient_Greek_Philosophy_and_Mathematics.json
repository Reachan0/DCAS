In this course we will read works of ancient Greek philosophy and mathematics, and investigate the way in which ideas of definition, reason, argument and proof, rationality and irrationality, number, quality and quantity, truth, and even the idea of an idea were shaped by the interplay of philosophic and mathematical inquiry. We will examine how the discovery of the incommensurability of magnitudes upset the Pythagorean faith that 'everything is number', and how early philosophy responded to this challenge to the Greek presumption that the\nkosmos\nis fundamentally understandable. Finally, we investigate Greek attempts to circumvent the resistance of human ethics to precise (i.e. quantitative) expression.\n\nAssignments\n\nReadings\n\nThere is a substantial amount of readings for this course.

      "content": "Writing a Paper For Me\n\n\" 'All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you\nknow.' So finally I would write one true sentence, and then go on from there.\nIt was easy then because there was always one true sentence that I knew or had\nseen or had heard someone say. If I started to write elaborately, or like\nsomeone introducing or presenting something, I found that I could cut the\nscrollwork or ornament out and throw it away and start with the first true\nsimple declarative sentence I had written.\" - Ernest Hemingway, A Moveable Feast\n\nPreparing to Write\n\n[1] Choose your theme/question\n[2] Articulate for yourself the two most interesting opposing positions on this question.\n[3] Decide which side of this divide you will fall on. Write down for yourself the initial reasons\nthat you fall on this side. These may not be the strongest arguments, but you want to develop\nthose arguments from your true convictions and strong intuitions.\n[4] Outline your argument. You will probably deviate from the outline, but it is still useful for\ngetting started and keeping on track.\n\nThe Paper\n\n[1] Clearly state the question you intend to answer in the opening paragraph. It is helpful if you\ngive the reader a sense of the direction your argument will take. For instance \"I intend to\ndemonstrate X. If I can demonstrate Y and Z, which, I will argue, entail X, then I will consider\nmy thesis substantially supported.\" You can greatly influence the way your paper is read by the\nway you set it up. If you specify your own criteria for success in the argument, the reader will\nmost likely judge you by those criteria. Most good opening paragraphs are written after the\npaper has been completed, though it is good to run this through as an exercise before writing the\nrest of the paper.\n\n2] Please avoid filler: \"The question of the nature of love has puzzled humankind since the dawn\nof time. Many a night by the campfire did our Cro-Magnon ancestors gaze at the stars\nand.....blah blah.\" Just cut to the argument. I am not opposed to beautiful prose, but every word\nin your paper should advance your arguments.\n\n[2] As your argument proceeds, give continuing clear signals of where it has been and where it is\nheaded. Turn signals, sub-conclusions when a part of the argument is concluded, sentences\nlinking two sub-arguments, anticipation of coming arguments - it is much better to err on the side\nof over-explaining the argument to the reader than under-explaining it. Subheadings within the\npaper are often helpful.\n\n[3] When you have concluded your argument, step into the shoes of your cleverest opponents\nand give me their most important and persuasive objections to your argument. Then tell me why\nI should not be convinced by those arguments.\n\n[4] Your concluding paragraph should really sum up the argument, reminding me of the course it\nhas taken, of the criteria of success you set for yourself and how you have fulfilled it.\n\n[5] An honest conclusion is better than b.s. A paper which admits that it has fallen short of\nproving its case can be an excellent paper. If, in addition, you can give some suggestions about\nwhat direction you might take to strengthen the argument in the future, I will admire your honest\nappraisal of your situation. If you conclude that 'Therefore, obviously, the question of the nature\nof love has been solved.' or some such, I will have you committed to the ward for deluded\nundergraduates.\n\nAfter The Paper\n\nA good way of telling if your argument proceeds in an orderly fashion is to try to outline the\npaper when completed. If it can be reduced to standard outline form, then you have an orderly\nargument. If not, you may need to do some rearranging.\n\nRandom Tips\n\n1] IN THE AGE OF SPELLCHECK, MISPELLED WORDS ARE A SIGN THAT THIS\nPAPER WAS NOT EVEN IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR YOU TO PUSH A BUTTON\nAT THE END.\n\n2] YOUR PAPER SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF THINKING AND RE-THINKING\nBEFORE BEGINNING TO WRITE.\n\n3] MY PET PEEVES:\n\nA] WORDS YOU ARE FORBIDDEN TO USE IN YOUR PAPERS WITHOUT\nSAYING PRECISELY WHAT YOU MEAN BY THEM: OBJECTIVE, SUBJECTIVE,\nREAL.\n\nB] YOU CANNOT USE THE WORD 'VALID' TO REFER TO ANYTHING\nOTHER THAN A PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED ARGUMENT.\n\nTechnical\n\n1] No name on papers, only I.D. #\n2] You must number your pages\n3] Papers submitted via email (details will be given in class)\n4] Preferred format is Word or RTF. If you must use Open Office, that is acceptable, though a\nbit of a pain. Please do not send a PDF, as I will just have to convert it in order to add\ncomments.\n5] You do not need to consult any material other than what we have read for class.\n6]. I am not a stickler for length, but if your paper is short and it seems clear that you could have\nprofitably said more, then this will count against you. If you have run out of things to say, try the\ntechnique of stepping into the shoes of your worthiest opponent.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nES.113 Ancient Greek Philosophy and Mathematics\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Analysis and Synthesis:\n\nA] Anonymous scholium to Euclid XIII:\n\n\"Analysis, then, is the taking of what is sought as if it were agreed to be true and following\nthrough the consequences from this to something genuinely agreed to be true, while synthesis is\nthe taking of something admitted and going through to something we then agree to be true.\" [I\ntook some liberties with translation to make this clearer to you. Apologies to Anonymous]\n\nB] Pappus of Alexandria [neo-Platonist, 4th century A.D.]:\n\"... in analysis we suppose that which is sought to be already done, and inquire what it is from\nwhich this comes about, and again what is the antecedent cause of the latter, and so on until, by\nretracing our steps, we light upon something already known or ranking as a first principle... But\nin synthesis, proceeding in the opposite way, we suppose to be already done that which was last\nreached in analysis, and arranging in their natural order as consequents what were formerly\nantecedents and linking them one with another, we finally arrive at the construction of what was\nsought...\"\n\n\"Analysis, then, is the way from what is sought, taken as admitted by means of previous\nsynthesis...but in synthesis, going in reverse, we suppose as admitted what was the last result of\nthe analysis, and, arranging in their natural order as consequences what were formerly the\nantecedents, and connecting them with one another, we arrive at the completion of the\nconstruction of what was sought, and call it synthesis.\"\n\nC] Francois Viete (the true founder of Western algebra, 16th century): \"In mathematics there is a\ncertain way of seeking the truth, a way which Plato is said first to have discovered, and which\nwas called 'analysis' by Theon and was defined by him as 'taking the thing sought as granted\nand proceeding by means of what follows to a truth that is uncontested'; so, on the other hand,\n'synthesis', is 'taking the thing that is granted and proceeding by means of what follow to the\nconclusion and comprehension of the thing sought\n\nD] Rene Descartes (16th century) in Objections and Replies:\n\"...the method of proof is two-fold, one being analytic, the other synthetic. Analysis shows the\ntrue way by which a thing was methodically discovered and derived, as it were effect from cause,\nso that, if the reader care to follow it and give sufficient attention to everything, he understands\nthe matter no less perfectly and makes it as much his own as if he had himself discovered it. But\nit contains nothing to incite belief in an inattentive or hostile reader; for if the very least thing\nbrought forward escapes his notice, the necessity of the conclusions is lost; and on many matters\nwhich, nevertheless, should be specially noted it often scarcely touches, because they are clear to\nanyone who gives sufficient attention to them.\n\n\"Synthesis contrariwise employs an opposite procedure, one in which the search goes as it were\nfrom effect to cause (though often here the proof itself is from cause to effect to a greater extent\nthan in the former case). It does indeed clearly demonstrate its conclusions, and it employs a\n\nlong series of definitions, postulates, axioms, theorems and problems, so that if one of the\nconclusions that follow is denied, it may at once be shown to be contained in what has gone\nbefore. Thus the reader, however hostile and obstinate, is compelled to render his assent. Yet\nthis method is not as satisfactory as the other and does not equally well content the eager learner,\nbecause it does not show the way in which the matter taught was discovered.\n\n\"It was synthesis alone that the ancient Geometers employed in their writings, not because they\nwere wholly ignorant of the analytic method, but, in my opinion, because they set so high a value\non it that they wished to keep it to themselves as an important secret.\"\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nES.113 Ancient Greek Philosophy and Mathematics\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

A plurality [plethos] is a kind of quantity if it [the quantity]\nis numerable [countable; arithmeton]; a magnitude is a kind if quantity if it [the quantity]\nis measurable. A plurality is said to be that which is divisible potentially into parts which\nare not continuous; a magnitude, on the other hand, is that which is potentially divisible\ninto parts which are continuous....Of these, a limited [peperasmenon] plurality is said to\nbe a arithmos, a limited length a line, a limited width a surface, and a limited depth, a\n\nbody.\n\nMetaphysics Iota (I)6, 1057a2-6:\nPlurality is as if it were [or \"such as\"; hoion] a genus of arithmos; for arithmos is a\nplurality measurable by the one. And in some sense [or \"in a way\"] the one and arithmos\n[or \"a arithmos\"] are opposed, not as contraries, but...as some relative things are; for the\none in so far as it is a measure is opposed to arithmos in so far as arithmos is measurable.\n\nMetaphysics Nu (N)1, 1087b33-1088a15:\nThe one signifies a measure, evidently. And in each case there is some different\nunderlying subject [hupokeimenon, thing laid down], such as in the musical scale a\nquarter-tone; in magnitude a finger or a foot or some other such thing; and in rhythm a\nbeat or a syllable....And this is also according to formula [or \"definition\" or \"account\":\nlogos]; for the one signifies a measure of some plurality and the arithmos signifies a\nmeasured plurality [a plurality that has been measured] and a plurality of measures.\nTherefore it is also with good reason that the one is not a arithmos; for neither is a\nmeasure measures, but a measure is a principle [or \"source\", arche], and so is the one.\n\nDefinitions of Unit\n\n1] Pythagoreans: \"one is not a # since a measure is not the thing measured\" 1088a7\n2] Thymarides: [Pythagorean 4th b.c.e.] unit as a \"limiting quantity\" Iamblichus 11-12\n3] \"an unitie is no number but the beginning and original of number.\" Baker 1568\n4] \"...Ramus, and such that have written since his time, affirme not only that an unite or one, is a\nnumber, but also that evry fraction or parte of an unite, is a number...\" Hylles 1592\n5] \"...unity alone out of all number, when it multiplies itself, produces nothing greater than\nitself...Unity, therefore, is non-dimensional and elementary.\" Nicomachus 238\n6] \"[a] if from a number there is subtracted no number, the given number remains [b] if from 3\nwe take 1, 3 does not remain [c] therefore one is not 'no number.'

      "content": "CHAPTER II\nDefinition\n\nEuclid's Elements begins with definitions, and at every new starting point\nwithin the work, new definitions are introduced. Plato's dialogues, on the other\nhand, almost all seem to be in search of definitions, which constantly elude the\ninterlocutors. Aristotle develops his arguments from initial arkhai of definitions\nand homologoumena, but he often first surveys conflicting opinions on the matter,\nand lets us know that the starting points are not as settled as his treatment will lead\nus to believe.\n\nWe see then that from the beginning, an adequate definition was central to\nboth pursuits. But we also see a contrast: whereas ancient mathematics seemingly\ncannot proceed without definitions in place, and whereas the bulk of ancient\nmathematics consists of what is done with the concepts developed in those\ndefinitions, ancient philosophy both marches on in the absence of solid definitions,\nand a good portion of it never leaves the arena of the search for those definitions.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson suggests that the Platonic revolution was based on the\nnew centrality of definition: \"At last comes Plato, who needs no barbaric point, or\ntattoo, or whooping; for he can define...He is the arrival of accuracy....He shall be\nas a God to me, who can rightly divide and define.\" 1 I think that Emerson is only\npartially right. Plato, rather than being the first to define, is the first to\nacknowledge fully the structural barriers to the definition and precise statement of\n\n1 \"Plato; or, the Philosopher\" found in Representative Men; Dial Press; John D. Morriss & Co.;\nPhiladelphia: 1906\n\nthe essence of anything. I do agree, however, that it is only, as Emerson claims,\nbecause Plato made defining - the search for the ti esti of the realities behind the\nwords we use - his central quest, that he was able to discover the essential limits\nto grasping the essence of important human concepts.2 And Emerson is certainly\nright that whoever can properly define is 'like a god' for Plato, for we see in\ndialogue after dialogue that among mere mortals both the most philosophical and\nanti-philosophical fail regularly at defining the words that we all use every day.\n\nI. Definition as Foundation\nThe following passage from Book VI (510b) of Plato's Republic gives us a\npicture of the foundational starting points of any investigation as lying in a realm\nbeyond ordinary reasoning. Though it does not appear so to modern readers, of the\nvarious kinds of arkhe, Plato perhaps has definition most in mind here:\n\n\"Thus:--There are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses\nthe skhemai given by the former division as images; the enquiry can only be\nhypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the\nother end. In the higher of the two, the soul passes out of hypotheses, and\ngoes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making no use of images as\nin the former case, but proceeding only in and through the eidei themselves.\n\nI do not quite understand your meaning, he said.\n\nThen I will try again; you will learn3 more easily after what has been\nsaid. I suppose that you know that those who are engaged in geometry,\nlogismos, and such matters hypothesize the odd and the even, the skhemai,\nand three eide of angles, and their 'sisters' in each pursuit, as if they were\n\n2 This analysis, I will suggest was intimately related to the Greek understanding of what we call 'irrational\nnumbers.'\n3 Mathesis, related to mathematke\n\nknown. They make these hypotheses, and do not deem it worthy4 to give any\nlogos of them either to themselves or others, as if they were evident to all.\nStarting from these, they go through what remains and end at a\nhomologoumenon concerning that which the investigation set in motion.5\n\nI entirely know this, he said.\n\nAnd do you not know also that although they avail themselves of the\neide that can be seen and make logoi about them, they are thinking not of\nthese, but of that which they are like; the rectangle itself and the diameter\nitself. That which they make or draw6, of which there are shadows and\nimages in water, they in turn use as images, but they are really seeking7 to\nsee8 the things themselves, which can only be seen with thought?\n\nYou speak the truth, he said.\n\nAccordingly, this is the eidos I spoke of as 'intelligible', although the\nsoul seeking9 it is forced to use hypotheses; not reaching the beginning,\nbecause she is unable to disembark from and rise above10 hypothesis, but\n\n4 axiosi, to deem worthy, is related to the word axioma, axioms\n5 This is a description of the method which Proclus will call synthesis - the primary method of Euclid's\nelements. See Chapter 3.\n6 There seems to be a contrast here between making something and thinking about it, which parallels the\ncontrast between descending from hypotheses, and ascending to them. Proclus says this explicitly:\nconstructions are a descent from pure being for the purpose of allowing us to arise through theorems back\ntowards Being. ??\n7 Zetousi: the derived term zetoumenon is the partner of homologoumenon mentioned in the previous\nparagraph. The two methods of analysis and synthesis involve reverse relationships between\nhomologoumena and zetoumena.\n8 Idein - first meaning is 'to see', and from that means also 'to understand'. Related to eidos.\n9 Zetesin: see note 7 above\n10 anotero ekbainein*, 'to disembark higher' At Phaedo 77d Plato speaks of the soul disembarking from\nthe body ekbainousan\n\nusing as images themselves that of which the things below are copies, they\nbelieve the latter to be more distinct11, and therefore esteem them.\n\nI understand, he said, that you are speaking of anything that comes\nunder geometry and its sister technai.\n\nThen understand now that by the other section of the intelligible I speak\nof that which the logos by itself grasps through the power of making\ndistinctions12, making hypotheses not the archai, but literally hypotheses, the\ninitial upward step to the very location of the non-hypothetical, which is the\narche of everything existing. Grasping this, and cleaving to that which\ncleaves to that place, it comes back down to a conclusion using absolutely no\nsensible things. Using eide, through themselves into themselves, it ends in\neide.\n\nWe will investigate this distinction of moving to and from archai more\nclosely in the next chapter when we take up the question of analytic and synthetic\napproaches. The modern reader might be surprised to find this passage in a\nchapter about definitions. It seems to be concerned with tracing reasoning back to\nbeginnings that are not hypothetical, but which are in some way self-evident truths.\nWe are very aware that some of the basic hypotheses of our sciences are\nunprovable speculations. Modern thought tends to be skeptical about finding any\nself-evident foundation for those speculations, but even moderns must admit the\npossibility of a non-hypothetical, self-evident principle. It is natural, however, to\nthink that such a starting point would be a proposition rather than a definition. We\ntend to think of definitions as mere clarifications of concepts already intuitively\n\n11 enargesi: can also mean palpable or bodily\n12 dialegesthai: most translators render this 'dialectic,' a complex Platonic concept concerning the way\nphilosophy proceeds. I am not so sure that the word should be turned into a static technical term, which is\none of the steps in formulating a Platonic 'doctrine'. I believe that translating it in its common meaning\nmight better capture the understanding of the word that Socrates' interlocutors held.\n\nunderstood, but both Plato and Aristotle saw definitions as genuine archai: a\nproper definition captures the ti esti of something, and therefore goes behind\nappearances to a fundamental truth. Aristotle, in the Posterior Analytics (70a30 ff),\nconsiders definitions to be among the archai of any science.13 Proclus, probably\nthe most important ancient commentator on Euclid, treats the word 'hypothesis' as\nidentical with the word 'definition.' (pg. 140) The true starting place of any\ninquiry is to understand fully the essence of the objects under investigation: in the\ncase of geometry, it is to understand what a point, a line, a straight line, etc., truly\nare. This meaning of 'hypothesis' is perhaps emblematic of the difference\nbetween the ancient and modern understanding of the starting point of scientific\ninquiry. For the ancients, the ideal starting point is a true statement of the nature\nof those things which can not be reduced to, or explained in terms of, anything\nelse; the arkhe which are self-grounded and, seen in the right way, self-evident.\nBut, while it seems obvious that definitions are in some sense at the\n'beginning' of any science, it is unclear exactly how they begin a chain of\nreasoning. We will see, for instance, that Euclid, while giving great care to find\ndefinitions which seem to seek the ti esti of the basic objects of mathematics,\nrarely actually employs those definitions in the body of his work. Definitions may\nindeed be more basic than axioms, but they are apparently less useful. If Euclid\nrarely refers back to definitions, what role exactly do definitions play in his chain\nof reasoning? We will take up this question later.\n\n13 Proclus, in his commentary on Euclid, seems to be suggesting that it is precisely definitions that are the 'hypotheses'\nof geometry, which are borrowed from a higher science in which they are not hypothetical. He gives the name\n'hypothesis' precisely to the category of arkhai that Euclid name horai,[definitions, boundaries]. There is some\nsuggestion that Proclus possessed a copy of Euclid in which 'hypotheis' was the name given to definitions. [Proclus,\npg. 62] For Aristotle, definitions (horismos) and hypotheses(hupothesis) are two species of what he calls posits\n(thesis). A hypothesis asserts one part of a contradiction, e.g., that something is or is not. .A definition does not assert\nor deny either part of a contradiction.\n\nII. Philosophy and the Definitions of Mathematics.\nThe passage from the Republic launches a strong tradition which locates the\nfoundational truths of mathematics outside the scope of mathematics, and more in\nthe province of something like philosophy.\nNote for instance Philo of Alexandria, (1st century B.C. - 1st century A.D.):\n\"Geometry ...needs philosophy to express definitions for its subject matter.\" 14\nThis is not far from what Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead\nwould say 1900 years later: \"...a definition is, strictly speaking, no part of the\nsubject in which it occurs. ...\"15 But we note that Philo specifically assigns this\nquestion of finding the right definitions to philosophy, whereas Russell and\nWhitehead do not. If the readings from Aristotle's Categories and Topics\nincluded in this chapter rightly characterize the 'ancient view', and the Meno\nsuggests it does, this distinction might have something to do with the difference\nbetween the Greek and the prevalent modern conception of what a definition is\nabout. Consider the rest of the Whitehead Russell statement, in contrast to\nAristotle:\n\n\"A definition is a declaration that a certain newly-introduced symbol or\ncombination of symbols is to mean the same as a certain other combination\nof symbols of which the meaning is already known...it is not true or false,\nbeing an expression of a volition, not a proposition.\"\n\nThis is in some contrast with Aristotle's and Plato's attempts to capture the\nessence of something in a definition. Before we read these treatments of definition,\nlet us consider antiquity's greatest example of foundational definitions, the\ndefinitions found in Book I of Euclid's Elements. We will want to keep these\n\n14 (Philo of Alexandria On the Creation 13-14, 48, 89-128. This opinion is commonly expressed from\nAristotle on. Cf. Proclus\n15 Principia Mathematica\n\ndefinitions in mind as antiquity's most precise set of examples, as we consider in\nthis chapter what ancient philosophers thought a definition is.\n\nIII Definitions in Euclid's Elements\n\nThese are the fundamental definitions for the whole 13 books of Euclid's\nElements. I present them here, first without commentary, so that the reader can\nsimply contemplate them. As an exercise, you might want to try to classify these\ninto different types of definitions as you go through them, and then see if your\ncategories match up with Aristotle's. Directly following these, some alternative\ndefinitions for the most important terms will be considered, and then the question\nof the nature of definition itself.\n\nThe Elements\nEuclid\nBook I\nDefinitions\n\nDefinition 1.\nA point is that which has no part.\n\nDefinition 2.\nA line is breadthless length.\n\nQ.2.ww: Must these two be defined negatively (that is, by saying what they\nare not, or do not have)? Does this affect the capacity of the definition to\nprovide understanding?\n\nDefinition 3.\nThe ends of a line are points.\n\nDefinition 4.\nA straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.\n\nDefinition 5.\nA surface is that which has length and breadth only.\n\nDefinition 6.\nThe edges of a surface are lines.\n\nDefinition 7.\nA plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.\n\nDefinition 8.\nA plane angle is the inclination to one another of two lines in a plane which\nmeet one another and do not lie in a straight line.\n\nDefinition 9.\nAnd when the lines containing the angle are straight, the angle is called\nrectilinear.\n\nDefinition 10.\nWhen a straight line standing on a straight line makes the adjacent angles\nequal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line\nstanding on the other is called a perpendicular to that on which it stands.\n\nDefinition 11.\n\nAn obtuse angle is an angle greater than a right angle.\n\nDefinition 12.\nAn acute angle is an angle less than a right angle.\n\nDefinition 13.\nA boundary is that which is an extremity of anything.\n\nDefinition 14.\nA skhema is that which is contained by any boundary or boundaries.\n\nDefinition 15.\nA circle is a plane skhema contained by one line such that all the straight\nlines falling upon it from one point among those lying within the skhema equal\none another.\n\nDefinition 16.\nAnd the point is called the center of the circle.\n\nDefinition 17.\nA diameter of the circle is any straight line drawn through the center and\nterminated in both directions by the circumference of the circle, and such a straight\nline also bisects the circle.\n\nDefinition 18.\nA semicircle is the skhema contained by the diameter and the circumference\ncut off by it. And the center of the semicircle is the same as that of the circle.\n\nDefinition 19.\n\nRectilinear skhemai are those which are contained by straight lines, trilateral\nskhemai being those contained by three, quadrilateral those contained by four, and\nmultilateral those contained by more than four straight lines.\n\nDefinition 20.\nOf trilateral skhemai, an equilateral triangle is that which has its three sides\nequal, an isosceles triangle that which has two of its sides alone equal, and a\nscalene triangle that which has its three sides unequal.\n\nDefinition 21.\nFurther, of trilateral skhemai, a right-angled triangle is that which has a right\nangle, an obtuse-angled triangle that which has an obtuse angle, and an acute-\nangled triangle that which has its three angles acute.\n\nDefinition 22.\nOf quadrilateral skhemai, a square is that which is both equilateral and right-\nangled; an oblong that which is right-angled but not equilateral; a rhombus that\nwhich is equilateral but not right-angled; and a rhomboid that which has its\nopposite sides and angles equal to one another but is neither equilateral nor right-\nangled. And let quadrilaterals other than these be called trapezia.\n\nDefinition 23\nParallel straight lines are straight lines which, being in the same plane and\nbeing produced indefinitely in both directions, do not meet one another in either\ndirection.\n\nQ.2.2: Thinking about all these definitions, what do you think would be\nEuclid's definition of a definition, including the elements he thinks are\nnecessary for a definition?\n\nQ.2.3 Are these definitions all of the same type? Do they have the same\nsort of ingredients?\n\nQ.2.4 What in particular, does Euclid mean by his definition of a point; A\nstraight line?\n\nII] Alternate Definitions\n\nNow that you have contemplated these definitions in themselves, here are\nsome alternative definitions of some of the most controversial terms in Euclid,\nmost from antiquity, and a few from modernity.\n\nA] Definitions of a point:\n\n1. That which has no part\n2. A unit that has position (Pythagoreans) [Aristotle, De Anima 409a6]\n3. Beginning of a line (Plato, according to Aristotle, Metaphysics 992a20)\n4. The indivisible beginning of all magnitudes (Herundes, reported by an-\nNairizi)\n5. A point may be a beginning or an end, or division of a line, but it is no part\nof it. (Aristotle, De Caelo 300a14, Physics 220a1-21)\n6. An extremity which has no dimension or an extremity of a line\n(Posidonius)\n7. The intersection of two lines is a point (Posidonius)\n8. The point is the limit of localization...the content of space vanishes;\nrelative position remains (Max Simon, 19th Century)\n9. ...the extremest limit of...spatial presentation (Thomas Heath)\n\n10. A point is the extremity of a line, the smallest possible mark (Apollonius,\n\nreported by Diogenes Laertius, 7.135)\n11. A point is the simplest locus, or the locus of not other locus (Leibniz,\nMetaphysical Foundations of Mathematics 1715)\n\nB] Definitions of a line\n\n1. The path of a point in motion (Aristotle, De Anima 409a4, implied)\n2. The flowing of a point (Aristotle De Anima 409a4)(Proclus, p. 79 and also\n\nattributed to Eratosthenes)\n3. Magnitude in one direction (Proclus p. 79, also, perhaps Aristotle Meta.\n\n1020a11-12)\n4. A magnitude divisible one way only (Aristotle Metaphysics 1016b25-27)\n5. distance (Apollonius)\n6. A line is the extremity of a surface or length without breadth, or that which\n\nhas length alone (Apollonius, Physics)\n7. One can say that a line is what divides the sunlight from the shadow.\n\n(Hero, Definitions)\n\nC] Definitions of a straight line:\n\n1. A straight line is whatever has its middle in front of both its ends (Plato,\n\nParmenides 137e)\n2. ...the limit of a finite plane, such that its centre is in a line with its\n\nextremes (Aristotle, Topics VI)\n\n3. The shortest distance between two points.16\n4. A homeomeric line in a plane which can be extended as far as one pleases\n\nwithout meeting itself.\" Lee Perlman\n5. A line in a plane which has the same shape on both sides, OR a line which\n\nhas the same shape on all sides. OR a line with only one shape (Eidos)\n\n(Perlman)\n6. A straight line is that which lies equally with respect to its straight points;\n\ncircular, whose path will be different from the arrangement of its points.\n\n[Balbus the surveyor]\n7. A line which, when its ends remain fixed, it remains fixed when turned\n\naround in the same plane. (Heron of Alexandria)\n8. The class of all the points whose places in relation to the two given points\nare uniquely determined. (Leibniz, Metaphysical Foundations of\nMathematics 1715)\n9. the simplest path through two given points. (Leibniz, Metaphysical\nFoundations of Mathematics 1715)\n\nQ.2.5 Assuming that in each case these authors are trying to define the\nsame 'thing' as Euclid, yet disagreeing about how to characterize what that\nthing is, how might one characterize the common object of definition about\nwhich there are contending and disagreeing definitions?\n\nIV] WHAT IS A DEFINITION?\n\n16 In On the Sphere and Cylinder Archimedes lists as the first of his postulates (lambanomena - things\ntaken or received): \"Of all lines which have the same extremities the straight line is the least\" Archimedes\nthus considers this a property - one so obvious that it is postulated rather than proven - of the straight line,\nrather than, as we would have it, the very definition of a straight line. Q.: By what criteria would you\ndecide that this is a definition rather than a property, and particularly, what would make it a definition\nof the 'essence' of a straight line?\n\nPerhaps the question that is the strongest undercurrent in the Platonic\ndialogues is: What exactly does it mean to define something? That is, what is the\ndefinition of a definition? Another way of thinking about this is to ask whether\nsome definitions define better than alternative attempts to define the same thing.\nIf so, then we may decide that certain sorts of definition are inherently more\nexplanatory than others. Consider, for instance, Proclus' comments on definitions\n(2) and (3) of a line, on page x above:\n\"The latter definition indicates perfectly the nature of the line, but\nthat which calls it the flowing of a point appears to explain it in terms of its\ngenerative cause, and sets before us not the line in general, but the material\nline.\" (pg. 79)\n\nClearly, both definitions 'delineate' the line from other entities. But one\nProclus holds to actually state the nature of a line, while the other, he thinks only\ngives us a kind of procedure for producing a (strictly material) line. Even if this\nprocedure generates lines and only lines, and therefore is perfectly adequate for\ndistinguishing what is and what is not a line, it is held to be an inferior definition\nbecause it does not tell us what a line is.\n\nThe following is one of Aristotle's treatments of 'definition', from his Posterior\nAnalytics. It is perhaps the oldest treatise on the subject in existence. Q.: Does he\nunderstand the nature of definition the same way that Plato and Euclid do?\n\nPosterior Analytics\nAristotle\n\nBook. I\n\nCh. 2\n\nIf a thesis assumes one part or the other of an enunciation, i.e. asserts either\nthe existence or the non-existence of a subject, it is a hypothesis; if it does not so\nassert, it is a definition. Definition is a 'thesis' or a 'laying something down', since\nthe arithmetician lays it down that to be a unit is to be quantitatively indivisible17;\nbut it is not a hypothesis, for to define what a unit is is not the same as to affirm its\nexistence. 18\n\nCh. 8\n...a definition is either a primary premise or a conclusion of a demonstration,\nor else only differs from a demonstration in the order of its terms.19\n\nCh. 10\nThe definition-viz. those which are not expressed as statements that anything\nis or is not-are not hypotheses20: but it is in the premises of a science that its\nhypotheses are contained. Definitions require only to be understood, and this is not\nhypothesis... all hypotheses and illegitimate postulates are either universal or\nparticular, whereas a definition is neither.21\n\nCh. 22\nIn the case of predicates constituting the essential nature of a thing,\n[demonstration] clearly terminates, seeing that if definition is possible, or in other\n\n17 Q.2.zzz: Is this different from the way you think of a unit? If this is the very definition of a unit, does\nit explain at all why the Greeks did not think of fractions as numbers?\n18 Aristotle is here clearly using the term 'hypothesis' differently from Proclus.\n19 As in the passage from the Republic, it seems we can rise to definitions, arkhe, through demonstration.\n20 Suggests that some definitions can also be hypotheses.\n21 Because it does not assert anything about either a whole class or any particulars. But is this the same\nidea of definition as Plato has? It seems more nominalist. Socrates seeks out definitions that are assertions\nabout a class of beings, and can be tested for adequacy against any individuals that seem to fall into that\nclass. Thus, once we have defined justice, the definition can be refuted 'empirically' if we can cite an\naction that seems obviously to fall into the category justice, yet which would be excluded by the definition.\nFor the Platonists, then, there is not an iron-clad distinction between hypothesis and definition.\n\nwords, if essential form is knowable, and an infinite series cannot be traversed,\npredicates constituting a thing's essential nature must be finite in number.\n\nNow attributes may be essential for two reasons: either because they are\nelements in the essential nature of their subjects, or because their subjects are\nelements in their essential nature. An example of the latter is odd as an attribute of\nnumber-though it is number's attribute, yet number itself is an element in the\ndefinition of odd; of the former, multiplicity or the indivisible, which are elements\nin the definition of number.\n\nBook II\nCh. 3\nLet us now state how essential nature is revealed and in what way it can be\nreduced to demonstration; what definition is, and what things are definable. And\nlet us first discuss certain difficulties which these questions raise, beginning what\nwe have to say with a point most intimately connected with our immediately\npreceding remarks, namely the doubt that might be felt as to whether or not it is\npossible to know the same thing in the same relation, both by definition and by\ndemonstration. It might, I mean, be urged that definition is held to concern\nessential nature and is in every case universal and affirmative; whereas, on the\nother hand, some conclusions are negative and some are not universal; e.g. all in\nthe second skhema are negative, none in the third are universal. And again, not\neven all affirmative conclusions in the first skhema are definable, e.g. 'every\ntriangle has its angles equal to two right angles'. An argument proving this\ndifference between demonstration and definition is that to have scientific\nknowledge of the demonstrable is identical with possessing a demonstration of it:\nhence if demonstration of such conclusions as these is possible, there clearly\ncannot also be definition of them. If there could, one might know such a\n\nconclusion also in virtue of its definition without possessing the demonstration of\nit; for there is nothing to stop our having the one without the other.\nInduction too will sufficiently convince us of this difference; for never yet by\ndefining anything-essential attribute or accident-did we get knowledge of it. Again,\nif to define is to acquire knowledge of a substance, at any rate such attributes are\nnot substances.\nIt is evident, then, that not everything demonstrable can be defined. What\nthen? Can everything definable be demonstrated, or not? There is one of our\nprevious arguments which covers this too. Of a single thing qua single there is a\nsingle scientific knowledge. Hence, since to know the demonstrable scientifically\nis to possess the demonstration of it, an impossible consequence will follow:-\npossession of its definition without its demonstration will give knowledge of the\ndemonstrable.\nMoreover, the basic premises of demonstrations are definitions, and it has\nalready been shown that these will be found indemonstrable; either the basic\npremises will be demonstrable and will depend on prior premises, and the regress\nwill be endless; or the primary truths will be indemonstrable definitions.\nBut if the definable and the demonstrable are not wholly the same, may they\nyet be partially the same? Or is that impossible, because there can be no\ndemonstration of the definable? There can be none, because definition is of the\nessential nature or being of something, and all demonstrations evidently posit and\nassume the essential nature-mathematical demonstrations, for example, the nature\nof unity and the odd, and all the other sciences likewise. Moreover, every\ndemonstration proves a predicate of a subject as attaching or as not attaching to it,\nbut in definition one thing is not predicated of another; we do not, e.g. predicate\nanimal of biped nor biped of animal, nor yet skhema of plane-plane not being\nskhema nor skhema plane. Again, to prove essential nature is not the same as to\nprove the fact of a connection. Now definition reveals essential nature,\ndemonstration reveals that a given attribute attaches or does not attach to a given\n\nsubject; but different things require different demonstrations-unless the one\ndemonstration is related to the other as part to whole. I add this because if all\ntriangles have been proved to possess angles equal to two right angles, then this\nattribute has been proved to attach to isosceles; for isosceles is a part of which all\ntriangles constitute the whole. But in the case before us the fact and the essential\nnature are not so related to one another, since the one is not a part of the other.\nSo it emerges that not all the definable is demonstrable nor all the\ndemonstrable definable; and we may draw the general conclusion that there is no\nidentical object of which it is possible to possess both a definition and a\ndemonstration. It follows obviously that definition and demonstration are neither\nidentical nor contained either within the other: if they were, their objects would be\nrelated either as identical or as whole and part.\n\nCh. 4\nSo much, then, for the first stage of our problem. The next step is to raise the\nquestion whether syllogism-i.e. demonstration-of the definable nature is possible\nor, as our recent argument assumed, impossible.\nWe might argue it impossible on the following grounds:-(a) syllogism proves\nan attribute of a subject through the middle term; on the other hand (b) its\ndefinable nature is both 'peculiar' to a subject and predicated of it as belonging to\nits essence. But in that case (1) the subject, its definition, and the middle term\nconnecting them must be reciprocally predicable of one another; for if A is to C,\nobviously A is 'peculiar' to B and B to C-in fact all three terms are 'peculiar' to\none another: and further (2) if A inheres in the essence of all B and B is predicated\nuniversally of all C as belonging to C's essence, A also must be predicated of C as\nbelonging to its essence.\nIf one does not take this relation as thus duplicated-if, that is, A is predicated\nas being of the essence of B, but B is not of the essence of the subjects of which it\nis predicated-A will not necessarily be predicated of C as belonging to its essence.\n\nSo both premises will predicate essence, and consequently B also will be\npredicated of C as its essence. Since, therefore, both premises do predicate\nessence-i.e. definable form-C's definable form will appear in the middle term\nbefore the conclusion is drawn.\nWe may generalize by supposing that it is possible to prove the essential\nnature of man. Let C be man, A man's essential nature--two-footed animal, or\naught else it may be. Then, if we are to syllogize, A must be predicated of all B.\nBut this premise will be mediated by a fresh definition, which consequently will\nalso be the essential nature of man. Therefore the argument assumes what it has to\nprove, since B too is the essential nature of man. It is, however, the case in which\nthere are only the two premises-i.e. in which the premises are primary and\nimmediate-which we ought to investigate, because it best illustrates the point\nunder discussion.\nThus they who prove the essential nature of soul or man or anything else\nthrough reciprocating terms beg the question. It would be begging the question, for\nexample, to contend that the soul is that which causes its own life, and that what\ncauses its own life is a self-moving number; for one would have to postulate that\nthe soul is a self-moving number in the sense of being identical with it. For if A is\npredicable as a mere consequent of B and B of C, A will not on that account be the\ndefinable form of C: A will merely be what it was true to say of C. Even if A is\npredicated of all B inasmuch as B is identical with a species of A, still it will not\nfollow: being an animal is predicated of being a man-since it is true that in all\ninstances to be human is to be animal, just as it is also true that every man is an\nanimal-but not as identical with being man.\nWe conclude, then, that unless one takes both the premises as predicating\nessence, one cannot infer that A is the definable form and essence of C: but if one\ndoes so take them, in assuming B one will have assumed, before drawing the\nconclusion, what the definable form of C is; so that there has been no inference,\nfor one has begged the question.\n\nNor, as was said in my formal logic, is the method of division a process of\ninference at all, since at no point does the characterization of the subject follow\nnecessarily from the premising of certain other facts: division demonstrates as\nlittle as does induction. For in a genuine demonstration the conclusion must not be\nput as a question nor depend on a concession, but must follow necessarily from its\npremises, even if the respondent denies it. The definer asks 'Is man animal or\ninanimate?' and then assumes-he has not inferred-that man is animal. Next, when\npresented with an exhaustive division of animal into terrestrial and aquatic, he\nassumes that man is terrestrial. Moreover, that man is the complete formula,\nterrestrial-animal, does not follow necessarily from the premises: this too is an\nassumption, and equally an assumption whether the division comprises many\ndifferentiae or few. (Indeed as this method of division is used by those who\nproceed by it, even truths that can be inferred actually fail to appear as such.) For\nwhy should not the whole of this formula be true of man, and yet not exhibit his\nessential nature or definable form? Again, what guarantee is there against an\ninessential addition, or against the omission of the final or of an intermediate\ndeterminant of the substantial being?\nThe champion of division might here urge that though these lapses do occur,\nyet we can solve that difficulty if all the attributes we assume are constituents of\nthe definable form, and if, postulating the genus, we produce by division the\nrequisite uninterrupted sequence of terms, and omit nothing; and that indeed we\ncannot fail to fulfill these conditions if what is to be divided falls whole into the\ndivision at each stage, and none of it is omitted; and that this-the dividendum-must\nwithout further question be (ultimately) incapable of fresh specific division.\nNevertheless, we reply, division does not involve inference; if it gives knowledge,\n\nit gives it in another way.USE THIS AS A FOOTNOTE FOR Theaetetus. Nor\nis there any absurdity in this: induction, perhaps, is not demonstration any more\nthan is division, yet it does make evident some truth. Yet to state a definition\nreached by division is not to state a conclusion: as, when conclusions are drawn\nwithout their appropriate middles, the alleged necessity by which the inference\nfollows from the premises is open to a question as to the reason for it, so\ndefinitions reached by division invite the same question.\nThus to the question 'What is the essential nature of man?' the divider replies\n'Animal, mortal, footed, biped, wingless'; and when at each step he is asked\n'Why?', he will say, and, as he thinks, proves by division, that all animal is mortal\nor immortal: but such a formula taken in its entirety is not definition; so that\neven if division does demonstrate its formula, definition at any rate does not turn\nout to be a conclusion of inference.\nHow then by definition shall we prove substance or essential nature? We\ncannot show it as a fresh fact necessarily following from the assumption of\npremises admitted to be facts-the method of demonstration: we may not proceed as\nby induction to establish a universal on the evidence of groups of particulars\nwhich offer no exception, because induction proves not what the essential\nnature of a thing is but that it has or has not some attribute. Therefore, since\npresumably one cannot prove essential nature by an appeal to sense perception or\nby pointing with the finger, what other method remains?\nTo put it another way: how shall we by definition prove essential nature? He\nwho knows what human-or any other-nature is, must know also that man exists;\nfor no one knows the nature of what does not exist-one can know the meaning\nof the phrase or name 'goat-stag' but not what the essential nature of a goat-\n\nstag is. But further, if definition can prove what is the essential nature of a thing,\ncan it also prove that it exists? And how will it prove them both by the same\nprocess, since definition exhibits one single thing and demonstration another\nsingle thing, and what human nature is and the fact that man exists are not the\nsame thing? Then too we hold that it is by demonstration that the being of\neverything must be proved-unless indeed to be were its essence; and, since\nbeing is not a genus, it is not the essence of anything. Hence the being of\nanything as fact is matter for demonstration; and this is the actual procedure of the\nsciences, for the geometer assumes the meaning of the word triangle, but that\nit is possessed of some attribute he proves. What is it, then, that we shall prove\nin defining essential nature? Triangle? In that case a man will know by definition\nwhat a thing's nature is without knowing whether it exists. But that is\nimpossible.\nMoreover it is clear, if we consider the methods of defining actually in use,\nthat definition does not prove that the thing defined exists: since even if there\ndoes actually exist something which is equidistant from a centre, yet why\nshould the thing named in the definition exist? Why, in other words, should\nthis be the formula defining circle? One might equally well call it the definition\nof mountain copper. For definitions do not carry a further guarantee that the thing\ndefined can exist or that it is what they claim to define: one can always ask why.\nMOST OF HIS EXAMPLES ARE MATHEMATICAL.\nSince, therefore, to define is to prove either a thing's essential nature or\nthe meaning of its name, we may conclude that definition, if it in no sense proves\nessential nature, is a set of words signifying precisely what a name signifies. But\nthat were a strange consequence; for (1) both what is not substance and what does\nnot exist at all would be definable, since even non-existents can be signified by a\nname: (2) all sets of words or sentences would be definitions, since any kind of\n\nsentence could be given a name; so that we should all be talking in definitions, and\neven the Iliad would be a definition: (3) no demonstration can prove that any\nparticular name means any particular thing: neither, therefore, do definitions, in\naddition to revealing the meaning of a name, also reveal that the name has this\nmeaning. It appears then from these considerations that neither definition and\nsyllogism nor their objects are identical, and further that definition neither\ndemonstrates nor proves anything, and that knowledge of essential nature is not\nto be obtained either by definition or by demonstration.\nSince definition is said to be the statement of a thing's nature, obviously\none kind of definition will be a statement of the meaning of the name, or of an\nequivalent nominal formula. A definition in this sense tells you, e.g. the meaning\nof the phrase 'triangular character'. When we are aware that triangle exists, we\ninquire the reason why it exists. But it is difficult thus to learn the definition of\nthings the existence of which we do not genuinely know-the cause of this\ndifficulty being, as we said before, that we only know accidentally whether or not\nthe thing exists. Moreover, a statement may be a unity in either of two ways, by\nconjunction, like the Iliad, or because it exhibits a single predicate as inhering not\naccidentally in a single subject.\nThat then is one way of defining definition. Another kind of definition is a\nformula exhibiting the cause of a thing's existence. Thus the former signifies\nwithout proving, but the latter will clearly be a quasi-demonstration of essential\nnature, differing from demonstration in the arrangement of its terms. For there is\na difference between stating why it thunders, and stating what is the essential\nnature of thunder; since the first statement will be 'Because fire is quenched in\nthe clouds', while the statement of what the nature of thunder is will be 'The noise\nof fire being quenched in the clouds'. Thus the same statement takes a different\n\nform: in one form it is continuous demonstration, in the other definition. Again,\nthunder can be defined as noise in the clouds, which is the conclusion of the\ndemonstration embodying essential nature. On the other hand the definition\nof immediates is an indemonstrable positing of essential nature.\nWe conclude then that definition is (a) an indemonstrable statement of\nessential nature, or (b) a syllogism of essential nature differing from\ndemonstration in grammatical form, or (c) the conclusion of a demonstration\ngiving essential nature.\nOur discussion has therefore made plain (1) in what sense and of what things\nthe essential nature is demonstrable, and in what sense and of what things it is not;\n(2) what are the various meanings of the term definition, and in what sense and of\nwhat things it proves the essential nature, and in what sense and of what things it\ndoes not; (3) what is the relation of definition to demonstration, and how far the\nsame thing is both definable and demonstrable and how far it is not.\nWe have already explained how essential nature is set out in the terms of a\ndemonstration, and the sense in which it is or is not demonstrable or definable; so\nlet us now discuss the method to be adopted in tracing the elements predicated as\nconstituting the definable form.\nNow of the attributes which inhere always in each several thing there are\nsome which are wider in extent than it but not wider than its genus (by attributes\nof wider extent mean all such as are universal attributes of each several subject,\nbut in their application are not confined to that subject). while an attribute may\ninhere in every triad, yet also in a subject not a triad-as being inheres in triad but\nalso in subjects not numbers at all-odd on the other hand is an attribute inhering in\nevery triad and of wider application (inhering as it does also in pentad), but which\n\ndoes not extend beyond the genus of triad; for pentad is a number, but nothing\noutside number is odd. It is such attributes which we have to select, up to the exact\npoint at which they are severally of wider extent than the subject but collectively\ncoextensive with it; for this synthesis must be the substance of the thing. For\nexample every triad possesses the attributes number, odd, and prime in both senses,\ni.e. not only as possessing no divisors, but also as not being a sum of numbers.\nThis, then, is precisely what triad is, viz. a number, odd, and prime in the former\nand also the latter sense of the term: for these attributes taken severally apply, the\nfirst two to all odd numbers, the last to the dyad also as well as to the triad, but,\ntaken collectively, to no other subject. Now since we have shown above' that\nattributes predicated as belonging to the essential nature are necessary and that\nuniversals are necessary, and since the attributes which we select as inhering in\ntriad, or in any other subject whose attributes we select in this way, are predicated\nas belonging to its essential nature, triad will thus possess these attributes\nnecessarily. Further, that the synthesis of them constitutes the substance of triad is\nshown by the following argument. If it is not identical with the being of triad, it\nmust be related to triad as a genus named or nameless. It will then be of wider\nextent than triad-assuming that wider potential extent is the character of a genus. If\non the other hand this synthesis is applicable to no subject other than the\nindividual triads, it will be identical with the being of triad, because we make the\nfurther assumption that the substance of each subject is the predication of elements\nin its essential nature down to the last differentia characterizing the individuals. It\nfollows that any other synthesis thus exhibited will likewise be identical with the\nbeing of the subject.\nThe author of a hand-book on a subject that is a generic whole should divide\nthe genus into its first infimae species-number e.g. into triad and dyad-and then\nendeavour to seize their definitions by the method we have described-the\ndefinition, for example, of straight line or circle or right angle. After that, having\n\nestablished what the category is to which the subaltern genus belongs-quantity or\nquality, for instance-he should examine the properties 'peculiar' to the species,\nworking through the proximate common differentiae. He should proceed thus\nbecause the attributes of the genera compounded of the infimae species will be\nclearly given by the definitions of the species; since the basic element of them all\nis the definition, i.e. the simple infirma species, and the attributes inhere\nessentially in the simple infimae species, in the genera only in arete of these.\nDivisions according to differentiae are a useful accessory to this method.\nWhat force they have as proofs we did, indeed, explain above, but that merely\ntowards collecting the essential nature they may be of use we will proceed to show.\nThey might, indeed, seem to be of no use at all, but rather to assume everything at\nthe start and to be no better than an initial assumption made without division. But,\nin fact, the order in which the attributes are predicated does make a difference--it\nmatters whether we say animal-tame-biped, or biped-animal-tame. For if every\ndefinable thing consists of two elements and 'animal-tame' forms a unity, and\nagain out of this and the further differentia man (or whatever else is the unity\nunder construction) is constituted, then the elements we assume have necessarily\nbeen reached by division. Again, division is the only possible method of avoiding\nthe omission of any element of the essential nature. Thus, if the primary genus is\nassumed and we then take one of the lower divisions, the dividendum will not fall\nwhole into this division: e.g. it is not all animal which is either whole-winged or\nsplit-winged but all winged animal, for it is winged animal to which this\ndifferentiation belongs. The primary differentiation of animal is that within which\nall animal falls. The like is true of every other genus, whether outside animal or a\nsubaltern genus of animal; e.g. the primary differentiation of bird is that within\nwhich falls every bird, of fish that within which falls every fish. So, if we proceed\nin this way, we can be sure that nothing has been omitted: by any other method\none is bound to omit something without knowing it.\n\nTo define and divide one need not know the whole of existence. Yet some\nhold it impossible to know the differentiae distinguishing each thing from every\nsingle other thing without knowing every single other thing; and one cannot, they\nsay, know each thing without knowing its differentiae, since everything is\nidentical with that from which it does not differ, and other than that from which it\ndiffers. Now first of all this is a fallacy: not every differentia precludes identity,\nsince many differentiae inhere in things specifically identical, though not in the\nsubstance of these nor essentially. Secondly, when one has taken one's differing\npair of opposites and assumed that the two sides exhaust the genus, and that the\nsubject one seeks to define is present in one or other of them, and one has further\nverified its presence in one of them; then it does not matter whether or not one\nknows all the other subjects of which the differentiae are also predicated. For it is\nobvious that when by this process one reaches subjects incapable of further\ndifferentiation one will possess the formula defining the substance. Moreover, to\npostulate that the division exhausts the genus is not illegitimate if the opposites\nexclude a middle; since if it is the differentia of that genus, anything contained in\nthe genus must lie on one of the two sides.\nIn establishing a definition by division one should keep three objects in view:\n(1) the admission only of elements in the definable form, (2) the arrangement of\nthese in the right order, (3) the omission of no such elements. The first is feasible\nbecause one can establish genus and differentia through the topic of the genus, just\nas one can conclude the inherence of an accident through the topic of the accident.\nThe right order will be achieved if the right term is assumed as primary, and this\nwill be ensured if the term selected is predicable of all the others but not all they of\nit; since there must be one such term. Having assumed this we at once proceed in\nthe same way with the lower terms; for our second term will be the first of the\nremainder, our third the first of those which follow the second in a 'contiguous'\nseries, since when the higher term is excluded, that term of the remainder which is\n\n'contiguous' to it will be primary, and so on. Our procedure makes it clear that no\nelements in the definable form have been omitted: we have taken the differentia\nthat comes first in the order of division, pointing out that animal, e.g. is divisible\nexhaustively into A and B, and that the subject accepts one of the two as its\npredicate. Next we have taken the differentia of the whole thus reached, and\nshown that the whole we finally reach is not further divisible-i.e. that as soon as\nwe have taken the last differentia to form the concrete totality, this totality admits\nof no division into species. For it is clear that there is no superfluous addition,\nsince all these terms we have selected are elements in the definable form; and\nnothing lacking, since any omission would have to be a genus or a differentia.\nNow the primary term is a genus, and this term taken in conjunction with its\ndifferentiae is a genus: moreover the differentiae are all included, because there is\nnow no further differentia; if there were, the final concrete would admit of division\ninto species, which, we said, is not the case.\nTo resume our account of the right method of investigation: We must start by\nobserving a set of similar-i.e. specifically identical-individuals, and consider what\nelement they have in common. We must then apply the same process to another\nset of individuals which belong to one species and are generically but not\nspecifically identical with the former set. When we have established what the\ncommon element is in all members of this second species, and likewise in\nmembers of further species, we should again consider whether the results\nestablished possess any identity, and persevere until we reach a single formula,\nsince this will be the definition of the thing. But if we reach not one formula but\ntwo or more, evidently the definiendum cannot be one thing but must be more than\none. I may illustrate my meaning as follows. If we were inquiring what the\nessential nature of pride is, we should examine instances of proud men we know\nof to see what, as such, they have in common; e.g. if Alcibiades was proud, or\nAchilles and Ajax were proud, we should find on inquiring what they all had in\n\ncommon, that it was intolerance of insult; it was this which drove Alcibiades to\nwar, Achilles wrath, and Ajax to suicide. We should next examine other cases,\nLysander, for example, or Socrates, and then if these have in common indifference\nalike to good and ill fortune, I take these two results and inquire what common\nelement have equanimity amid the vicissitudes of life and impatience of dishonor.\nIf they have none, there will be two genera of pride. Besides, every definition is\nalways universal and commensurate: the physician does not prescribe what is\nhealthy for a single eye, but for all eyes or for a determinate species of eye. It is\nalso easier by this method to define the single species than the universal, and that\nis why our procedure should be from the several species to the universal genera-\nthis for the further reason too that equivocation is less readily detected in genera\nthan in infimae species. Indeed, perspicuity is essential in definitions, just as\ninferential movement is the minimum required in demonstrations; and we shall\nattain perspicuity if we can collect separately the definition of each species\nthrough the group of singulars which we have established e.g. the definition of\nsimilarity not unqualified but restricted to colors and to skhemai; the definition of\nacuteness, but only of sound-and so proceed to the common universal with a\ncareful avoidance of equivocation. We may add that if dialectical disputation must\nnot employ metaphors, clearly metaphors and metaphorical expressions are\nprecluded in definition: otherwise dialectic would involve metaphors.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nES.113 Ancient Greek Philosophy and Mathematics\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "MENO\nBy Plato\nTranslated by Lee Perlman\nThe bold numbers and letters are universal 'stephanus' page numbers,\nwhich provide a common reference between different translations\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Meno, Socrates, A Slave of Meno\n(Boy), Anytus.\n70 MENO: Can you tell me1, Socrates, whether arete is something that can\nbe taught; or if not through teaching, through practice, or if neither by\npractice nor through learning, does it accrue to humans by nature, or in some\nother way?\nSOCRATES: Meno, the Thessalians used to be held in high repute and\nmarveled B at among the Greeks for their horsemanship and their riches, but\nnow, it seems to me, also for wisdom, not least the citizens of Larissa, the\ncity of your companion Aristippus. The cause of this is Gorgias. For he came\nto the city and made the foremost of the Aleuadae lovers of his wisdom,\namong them your lover2 Aristippus, as well as the other Thessalians. And he\naccustomed you to the habit C of answering any question asked of you\nfearlessly and magnificently, exactly like those who know; just as he himself\nstands ready for any question a Greek wishes to ask, and never fails to\nanswer. But in this region, dear Meno, the opposite has come to pass. There\n\n1 Exeis moi epein means literally 'Do you have it to tell me?\" There is some reason to think that Plato\nplayed with the conventions of the epic tradition, in which the first word set the theme for the entire poem.\nHere, this would suggest that the question of whether knowledge is a kind of 'having' or possession is\ncentral to the Meno. The question certainly comes up in Plato's other dialogue that explicitly concerns\nknowledge. See Theaetetus xxxx in the stranger's debunking of the model of seeking knowledge as hunting\nbirds in a bird cage. Certainly there the question is what it means to 'have' knowledge. The phrase could\nalso mean something like \"Tell me, if you have it in you...\" That is, it could have a challenging tone. See\nKlein pg. 40\n2 Notice here the connection between Larissa and lovers. This theme will be revisited later in the dialogue\nas a clue to the nature of knowledge.\n\nis a drought of wisdom here, and wisdom seems 71 to have ventured out\nfrom our land to yours. At any rate, if you want to ask any one around here,\nnone of them will fail to laugh, and say: 'Stranger, I must appear to you\nblessed to know whether arete is teachable, or in what way it accrues. I am\nso far from knowing whether it is teachable or not teachable, that I know\nabsolutely nothing of what arete happens to be.'3\nB And I myself, Meno, am as poor as my fellow citizens in this matter. I\naccuse myself of knowing4 absolutely nothing at all5 about arete ; and when\nI do not know the ti esti of anything how can I know the hopoion? Does it\nseem to you that anyone who did not know6 anything at all (to parapan) of\nwho Meno is would know if he is beautiful or rich or nobly born, or the\nopposite of these? Does this seem to you the way it works?\nMENO: Not to me. Is it the truth about you, Socrates, that you do not know\nwhat C arete is? Should we bring such tidings of you home?\nSOCRATES: Not only that, my companion, but I believe that I have never\nhappened on anyone else who knew.\nMENO: What's this? Did you not encounter Gorgias when he was here?\nSOCRATES: I did.\n\n3 Anytus, the only Athenian besides Socrates in this dialogue (90b), gives the lie to this claim about 'any'\nAthenian'.\n4 The word used for 'know' here is eidos, which is related to and close to eidos, which means shape, and\nlater has a very special meaning for Plato of 'idea' that we will explore in Chapter 6. The reader will notice\nthat the idea of 'shape' is employed a number of times in this dialogue.\n5 The Greek here is to parapan, a very strong way of saying 'absolutely nothing at all.' This hints at the\nquestion that Meno will raise at 80d: whether 'knowing' is an all or nothing proposition. Meno asks, \"How\nwill you look for something if you do not know at all (to parapan) what it is. The question is raised\nwhether we can truly know something without knowing it completely. A similar question is raised at 79 c\nabout whether we can know what a part of something is if we do not know the whole of which it is a part.\n6 The word for know here is gignoskei, in contrast to all the words from oida which surround it. Oida we\nhave noted [note 18] is etymologically related to (and perhaps generative of) eidos, which plays an\nimportant part in the dialogue and Plato's philosophy in general. So there may be some significance in\nabstaining from the use of an oida word here. Gignoskei would seem to suggest something like\n'familiarity', and the contrast between Gignoskc and oida suggests Russell's contrast between 'knowledge\nby acquaintance' and 'knowledge by description'. It is a question, which the Meno will touch upon,\nwhether the ti esti of things is known as one knows a person, or as one knows the conclusion of a\nEuclidean proposition\n\nMENO: Did it not seem to you that he knew?\nSOCRATES: All said, I don't remember things well, Meno, and therefore I\ncannot say7 in the present how he seemed to me then. But perhaps he did\nknow this, and you know what he said: remind me of what he said; or, if you\nwish, tell D me yourself what it is; for perhaps the matter seems to you just\nas it does to him.\nMENO: It does.\nSOCRATES: Since he is now far from here, let's leave him alone; Meno,\nyou yourself say what, by the gods, you declare arete to be. Tell me and do\nnot begrudge me; my falsehood will have tricked me into the greatest fortune\nif you bring to light the fact that you and Gorgias do know; my having said\nthat I have never encountered anyone who knew.\nE MENO: But Socrates, it is not difficult to tell. First, if you want the\narete of a man, it is easy. This is a man's arete: to be competent at the affairs\nof the city, and in so doing to do good to those he likes and bad to those he\nhates; taking care not to suffer harm himself. If you want the arete of a\nwoman, that is not difficult to recount: she must manage her house well,\nkeeping the interior safe and sound, and obeying her husband. And another\nis the virtue 71of a child, both female and male, and of the old man, and if\nyou wish, the freeman and, again, the slave. And there are very many other\naretai, and there is no puzzle in saying what each one is. For according to\neach manner of acting and time of life there is for each of us an arete for each\nkind of work. And the same may be said of kakia, Socrates. SOCRATES:\nMany are my blessings, Meno, if - as if consulting an oracle - seeking one\nvirtue I discover that you have put forth a swarm of virtues. But to B really\n\n7 ouk echo eipeiv see note 15. This introduces the topic of memory and links it to the notion of knowledge\nas something we possess or 'have'.\n\npursue the image 8 of the swarm: if I were asking you what is the essence9 of\nthe bee and you told me that there are many kinds of all sorts of bees, how\nwould you answer me if I asked, \"Do you say there are many kinds of all\nsorts of them because they differ from each other in being bees, or that they\ndo not differ from each other in this, but in beauty or size or shape or some\nother such thing?\" How would you answer such a question?\nMENO: I would say they do not differ, one from the other, in being bees.\nC SOCRATES: If, then, I further said this: Accordingly now, tell me this,\nMeno; what is it in virtue of which they do not differ but are everyone the\nsame. Perhaps you are able to tell me10 this?\nMENO: I can.\nSOCRATES: And just so concerning the aretai, even if they are many kinds\nof all sorts, they all have one, same, particular eidos11 through which they are\naretai; and someone who would answer the question, 'What is arete?' would\ndo well to focus D his attention12 clearly on this. Or do you not understand?\nMENO: I believe I understand; but I do not yet take hold of13 the question as\nI want.\nSOCRATES: Does it seem to you that only virtue is like that, Meno, that\nthere is one for a man and another for a woman? Or is it the same for health\nand size and strength? Does there seem to you to be one health for a man and\n\n8 Eikona: This word will prove important in the sections of the Republic we will read. See pg. xxx\n9 Ousia: the word means being, and in common use can mean someone's important possessions, much like we talk of\na man's property in English as his 'substance'. It developed in Greek philosophy a technical meaning of 'essence', a\nmeaning that was solidified when the word was translated into Latin.\n10 Echeis....eipein. again the phrase 'have it to tell me'\n11 This is the first appearance of this word, which plays a large role in Platonic philosophy, in the dialogue.\nNote that it comes in as that which brings unity to a many. It is a 'one' or a unit, through which the many\nbecome what they are.\n12 Apoblepsanta: from the verb apoblepo, which means literally and in many common uses 'look away from'. The\nidea that focusing on the eidos of something is intimately connected with, or perhaps equivalent to 'looking away from'\nthe many that it subtends, might be suggested by this word choice.\n13 Katekho: has a strong sense of 'take into one's possession', become master of. That Meno says this\nafter saying he only 'believes' (dokho) that he understands might be a foreshadowing of Plato's argument\nabout 'right opinion (belief)' as a slippery grasp of moving statues (pg. xxx). It also re-poses the question\nof knowledge as a kind of possession, begun with the first word of the dialogue.\n\none for a woman, or is it everywhere the same eidos, if it is really health,\nwhether in a man or anything whatsoever?\nMENO: It seems to me14 that health is the same both in a man and a woman.\nSOCRATES: Accordingly also for size and strength? If a woman is strong,\nis it the same eidos and the same strength by which she is strong. By 'the\nsame' I am saying that strength, with regard to being strength, is the same\nwhether in a man or in a woman. Or does it seem to you that there is some\ndifference?\nMENO: Not to me.\n73 SOCRATES: And will arete differ in being arete, whether in a child or\nin an elder, in a woman or in a man?\nMENO: This seems to me, Socrates, to be no longer the same as the others.\nSOCRATES: But what? Did you not say that the arete of a man was to\n'manage the house' of a city well, and a woman of a house?\nMENO: I did.\nSOCRATES: And can either house or state or anything whatsoever be well\nmanaged unless managed prudently and justly?\nMENO: Certainly not.\nB SOCRATES: Then if they manage justly or prudently, they manage with\njustice and sophrosune?15\nMENO: Necessarily.\nSOCRATES: Then both need the same thing, if they intend to be, both\nwomen and men; justice and temperance?\nMENO: It appears so.\n\n14 Moi dokei: Variants of this phrase are appearing with unusual frequency. I always translate it as 'It\nseems to me\". I translate doko as \"I believe\" Both of these are related to the important theme of the\ndialogue of the difference between knowledge and opinion (doxe). It is worth noting then when a character\nsays they believe something, or something 'seems' to them a certain way, what is going on, as an example\nof what holding an opinion is like.\n15 Q.2.yy Is Socrates just repeating himself here, or does saying that something is done 'with justice'\n(the Greek could also mean 'by justice') have a different meaning than saying it is done 'justly'?\n\nSOCRATES: But what then with a child or an elder; could they ever\nbecome good, if they are licentious and unjust?\nMENO: Certainly not.\nC SOCRATES: But they must be temperate and just?\nMENO: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Then all humans are good in the same way, for they become\ngood by gaining the same things?16\nMENO: It seems so.\nSOCRATES: And it is not possible, if they did not have the same arete, for\nthem to be good in the same way?\nMENO: Certainly not.\nSOCRATES: Since then the same arete is in all, try to tell me, and to remember17\nwhat Gorgias says that arete is, and you with him.\nMENO: Is it anything other to rule human beings, if you really seek18 one19\n'something' to subtend all?\nSOCRATES: But that is what I seek. But is it the same arete in both a child and a\nslave, Meno: to rule his master. And does it seem to you that he is still a slave who\nrules?\nMENO: It does not seem that way to me at all, Socrates.\nSOCRATES: For it is not reasonable, best of men. Then consider this also; you\ndeclare it to be 'fitness to rule', but shall we not add right there 'justly and not\nunjustly'?\nMENO: I certainly think so, Socrates; for justice is arete.\n\n16 This seems to solidify the sense that Justice and Sophrosune are substantives, not just abstractions of\nmodifiers. Justice is something one can 'gain' or obtain. This also touches on the question of whether\nthese incorporeal 'things' - most of all, in this dialogue, knowledge - are something we 'have.'\n17 Anemnesthai: the theme of knowledge as recollection or memory is foreshadowed here. See also 70c\n18 zeteis: Once again the term for seeking, that later gets formalized in Greek mathematics meaning\nsomething like 'the unknown' that we reason from in analysis, and to in synthesis. See ftnte 6,this chapter.\n19 The number 'one' appears here again (see also 71a, 72c, 72d) perhaps to emphasize that above all of the\nmanyness that Meno observes, there may be a unifier, and perhaps it is not incorrect to say a 'unit'. See\nCh. 7 pg. xxx\n\nE SOCRATES: Which of these two, Meno: 'arete,', or 'a certain arete '?\nMENO: What do you mean by this?\nSOCRATES: Just as with any other thing; just as, if you wish, I would say that\nroundness is 'a certain sort of skhema ' and not skhema, simply. I would speak this\nway because there are other skhemata.\nMENO: You would be right to say that, since I also am saying that there is not\nonly20 justice, but also other aretai.\n74 SOCRATES: What are they? Tell me, just as I also would tell you the other\nskhemata if you summoned21 me. Therefore, you also, tell me other aretai.\nMENO: Further, then, courage seems to me to be an arete, and sophrosune and\nwisdom and magnanimity, and very many others.\nSOCRATES: Again, Meno, we suffer the same result: seeking one arete we\nhave found many, though now in another way; but the one which runs through\nthem all. we have been incapable of finding. B\nMENO: Socrates, I am still not able to grasp that which you seek, the one arete\nover all, just like with the others.\nSOCRATES: As was to be expected; but I myself am eager to move us forward\nin this. For you understand how this holds the same for everything.22 If someone\nshould ask what I just now said, \"What is skhema, Meno?\" and if you said to him\nthat it is 'roundness,'; and if he said to you, just as I do, \"Which of the two: is\nroundness 'skhema' or 'a certain skhema;' you would probably say 'a certain\nskhema.'23\nMENO: By all means.\n\n20 ou monon: in this context monon means 'only' but in a mathematical context it can mean 'unit'. While\nMeno is agreeing with Socrates here, he is resisting Socrates' drive to find the one thing that arete is: the,\nperhaps, 'unit' of the aretai.\n21 A legal term; perhaps there is some significance in this language since Socrates' real-life accuser appears\nnear the end of the dialogue. See xx and ftnte. xxx\n22 Note at xxx that knowledge as recollection depends on a sameness that runs through everything\n23 Socrates has performed a sneaky 'conversion' (antistrophe) here, which is the test of a definition. If\nMeno says that skhema is roundness, the proper question to then ask him, to discover if this is an adequate definition,\nis \"Is roundness skhema?\" Only when such a turnaround is possible do we have a true definition. See Klein pg. 57\n\nC SOCRATES: In consequence of this: that there are also other skhemata?\nMENO: Yes.\nSOCRATES: And if he inquired further what other skhemata there are, you\nwould have told him.\nMENO: I would.\nSOCRATES: And if he asked in like manner what color is, and you answered\nwhiteness, and the questioner rejoined with this: \"Which of these two: is\nwhiteness color or a certain color?\" You would reply, \"A certain color, because\nthere happen to be others also.\"\nMENO: I would.\nSOCRATES: And if he bid you to tell him the other colors, you would tell him\nD the others, those which happen to be no less a color than white is.\nMENO: Yes.\nSOCRATES: If, then, he went after the argument as I would and said, \"We are\nforever returning to a 'many'. This is not what I'm after. Tell me then, since you\ncall this many by one specific name, and say that none of them are not a skhema,\neven those that are opposite to each other, what is that which dwells in24 the round\nno less than the straight. You give it the name skhema and say that the\nE round is not more a skhema than the straight\" Or is that not what you say?\nMENO: It is.\nSOCRATES: And when you say this, you are saying that the round is not more\nround than straight, nor the straight more straight than round?\nMENO: Not probable, Socrates.\nSOCRATES: But you are saying that the round is not more a skhema than the\nstraight, and vice-versa?\nMENO: You speak the truth.\n\n24 katechei: could also be translated 'posseses', touching once again on the question of ideas as\npossessions. See footnote 27.\n\nSOCRATES: Then, of what in the world is the name, skhema? Make an attempt\n75 to say25. If, being asked something like this about either skhema or color, you\nsaid, \"But fellow, I myself do not understand what you want; or know26 what you\nare saying\". Perhaps he would wonder and say, \"Do you not understand that I am\nseeking that which is the same about all of these?\" Or would you have nothing to\nsay27 about these matters, if someone asked you this, \"What is it about the round\nand the straight, and about the others, that you call skhema, which is the same\nabout all?\" Try to say; as practice,28 so that you can provide an answer concerning\narete.\nB MENO: No, Socrates, you say.\nSOCRATES: Do you want me to indulge you?\nMENO: By all means.\nSOCRATES: And then you will also be willing to tell me about arete?\nMENO: I will.\nSOCRATES: Then I must try eagerly, because it is worth it.\nMENO: Absolutely.\nSOCRATES: Bear with me then. Let us attempt to tell you what skhema is29.\nConsider whether you accept that this is what it is:--Skhema is the only thing\n\n25 same phrase at 73c6\n26 manthano[understand], oida [know]. The meaning of these two phrases hardly seems different, but\nPlato seems to purposefully vary the words used. The first also means learn, and is perhaps weaker than\nthe second, which strongly means 'know', and, for readers of Plato, cannot help but suggest its offshoot\neidos. When Plato seems to be saying the same thing twice, but with deliberate alterations in words or\nphrasing, it is always possible that some shading is being added, or that the argument is being nudged in a\ndirection. See 73b, footnote 29\n27 ekheis eipein: See footnote 16\n28 Meno asked at the start of the dialogue whether arete comes through teaching or practice. Socrates is\nhere asking him to practice the art of definition, rather than teaching it to him (melete: a different word for\npractice here, which also hints at 'study')\n29 ti estin: not the first appearance of this phrase. It suggests that we are about to formulate an 'essential'\ndefinition, but Socrates suggests a definition based on a condition that seems universally applicable to\nshape, but does not at all suggest itself as essential He then says that he would be content with a similar\ndefinition of arete, clearly indicating that such would be a less than perfect definition.\n\namong the existing things which always happens30 to accompany color. Does this\nsatisfy you, or do you seek some other way? I would be content if you said\nC something like this to me about arete.\nMENO: But this is simple-minded, Socrates.\nSOCRATES: How, would you say?\nMENO: That skhema, according to your argument, is that which always\naccompanies color. Fine. But if someone said that he did not know color, but was\nas stumped by this as he is by skhema, what would you think about this answer to\nhim\nSOCRATES: I would think that it is true. And if the questioner were someone\nclever who is both disputatious and competitive, I should say to him, \"What's\nD been said by me is there; if what I say is not right, it is your job to take hold of\nthe argument and refute it.\" But if, being friends just as you and I now are,\nwishing to talk to each other, I should reply in a gentler way and answer more\nconversationally31. It is probably more conversational to answer not only with the\ntruth, but also only by means of that which the questioner concedes that he\nknows.32 And this is the way in which I too will attempt to speak with you. Tell\nE me, then: Do you call anything 'an end'? I am saying something like 'a limit'\nor 'an extremity'; by all these I am saying the same thing. Prodicus would\nprobably disagree with us: but still you, anyway, would call something 'ended' or\n'completed'? That is all I want to say, not anything intricate.33\n\n30 Tunchanei... aei: \"always happens to\" perhaps, following the last footnote, this indicates the universal\nand accidental nature of this definition, which truly delineates, but perhaps does not truly define skhema.\nEven if a surface is always colored, colored does not mean the same thing as surface. See Aristotle,\nMetaphysics, 1029b17-20\n31 Dialektikoteron: could be translated 'more dialectically', suggesting that Socrates is here using a kind of\n'technical' platonic term, which has no easy translation (\"philosophically\" might suggest some part of what\nthe word means. See footnote 11\n32 This is what Proclus and others will call the homologoumenon, a word that often substitutes for the word\n'premise' - the 'something agreed upon.' Meno seems unwilling to take even simple starting points as\nagreed upon.\n33 Poikilon: multicolored. Perhaps an allusion to the recent difficulty Meno professed to have with taking\nthe concept color' as understood. There is some irony here in that Socrates has jumbled together a number\n\nMENO: Yes, I would; and I believe that I understand what you are saying.\n76 SOCRATES: Let's see: you call something a surface, and another a solid, in\nthe manner of such things in geometry.\nMENO: Yes, I speak in those terms.\nSOCRATES: You already now should be able to understand from this what I\nmean by skhema. Concerning all skhema I say that skhema is that in which the\nsolid ends;34 or, putting it more comprehensively, I would say that skhema is the\nvery thing that is the limit of solid.35\nMENO: And what do you say color is, Socrates?\nSOCRATES: You are abusive, Meno: you stack up all of these problems for an\nold man to answer, but you yourself do not want to recollect36, so as to tell what\nB Gorgias says arete is.\nMENO: When you have told this, Socrates, I will tell you.\nSOCRATES: But even someone who was veiled would perceive, by the way you\ntalk, that you are beautiful and still have lovers.\nMENO: How so?\nSOCRATES: Because in your words there is nothing but orders: like all delicate\nblossoms, you are tyrannical in blooming time; and also you have probably\n\nof similar terms without distinguishing their nuances (as Prodicus was famous for doing). What we are\nagreeing to then is not a clear 'one', but in fact, as it stands, multicolored and ambiguous. Meno prefers to\nstart at such a place.\n\nSocrates is taking the idea of an agreed on starting place very literally. Even if we suppose that an\nimportant contemporary thinker would not agree with us, we have a starting point if the two of us agree.\nThis is the very paradigm of the 'hypothetical' approach, taken to an extreme, that Socrates found\ninadequate in the passage from the Republic earlier in this chapter.\n34 This is a form of definition that Aristotle, in the portion of the Prior Analytics we will read in this\nchapter, will find inadequte:\n\"Thus absolutely the prior is more intelligible than the posterior, a point, for instance, than a line, a line than a plane,\nand a plane than a solid....Absolutely, then, it is better to try to make what is posterior known through what is prior,\ninasmuch as such a way of procedure is more scientific.\"\n35 Unlike Socrates' first definition of skhema, this one seems to require that we already have an intuitive notion of\nwhat skhema is to see that this rather procedural definition adequately delineates 'concerning all skhema\" what skhema\nis. The first definition had intuitive appeal, but lacked this precise power of delineation. The 'zetetic paradox' that\nMeno will bring up shortly asks exactly what the relationship is between these two kinds of definition. This shift from\nthe intuitive to the precise is also a shift from the colloquial to the technical, as Klein points out (p. 65)\n36 The word here is anamnestheis. Anamnesis is the answer that Socrates offers to Meno's zetetic\nparadox.\n\nC discovered that I am incapable of opposing the beautiful, and therefore I will\nindulge you and answer.\nMENO: By all means, indulge.\nSOCRATES: Then do you want me to answer you a la Gorgias, so that you can\nbest follow?\nMENO: Yes I want that. Why wouldn't I?\nSOCRATES: Accordingly: Do not you two, following Empedocles, say that\nthere are certain 'flowings' of beings?\nMENO: Very much so.\nSOCRATES: And flow-openings into which and through which the flowings\nflow37?\nMENO: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: And some of the flowings fit into the flow-openings, and some D\nof them are smaller or larger?\nMENO: Yes, that's it.\nSOCRATES: And there is something you call sight38?\nMENO: Yes.\nSOCRATES: And now, as Pindar says, \"understand that which I say to you\":--\ncolor is a flowing of shapes commensurate39 with and perceptible to sight.40\n\n37 There is a triple pun in the Greek which cannot be translated, which gives the effect of pompous pseudo-\nscientific wording, akin to explaining sleep as the consequence of 'somniferous qualities' (or explaining\nthat things fall down because of 'gravity')\n38 Therefore, he knows color, at least as shades, and the first starting point in defining shape was a\nhomologoumenon for the two of them.\n39 The word is summetros, the word used to express commensurability in Greek mathematics. It occurs\nonly 29 times in all of Plato's works. Here it seems to foreshadow the mathematics problem that Plato will\npose to the slave, though the idea of incommensurability is not mentioned there. Given these two\ninstances, it is worth considering the relationship between the problem of incommensurability and the\nproblem of knowledge that is central in the Meno. The exact same use of summetros, describing the\n'commensurability' of eye and color, occurs in the Theaetetus (156d), the other Platonic dialogue explicitly\non knowledge. That dialogue begins with a discussion of the mathematical problem of\nincommensurability. See pg. xx of this volume.\n40 Note that, while before Meno would not accept a definition of shape that referred to color, here color is\nitself reduced to nothing but an epiphenomenon of shape. This process of definition by reduction has a\nvery modern tone, despite the naivety of the 'science' here.\n\nMENO: That, Socrates, seems to me to be the best of the answers you have\ngiven.\nSOCRATES: Perhaps because it was said in the manner habitual to you41. And\nalso, I suppose, because you hope to be able to say from this both what sound is\nand smell, and many other things such as these42.\nMENO: Entirely true.\nSOCRATES: The answer, Meno, was in the tragic style43, so it pleases you\nmore44 than the one about skhema.45\nMENO: It does.\nSOCRATES: But it is not so, O son of Alexidemos; I myself am persuaded that\nthe other was the better; and I believe it would seem so to you, if you were not\n\n41 Harking back to the original question; whether virtue comes through habit. Socrates seems to be\nsuggesting that what Meno finds an adequate homologoumenon and a persuasive way of proceeding from\nthat starting point, is based entirely on habit. This, of course, must prompt the readers to ask whether our\nhomologoumena - such as Euclid's 5th postulate - are no more than the formalization of our habitual\ninteractions with the world. Is 'self-evidence' nothing but habit? See Klein pg. 69\n42 In footnote 41 we noticed that Meno has accepted this definition in part because it is 'reductionist.' Here\nwe see the second important modern criterion of explanation and in this case definition that Socrates\nanticipates Meno accepting: what we might call 'fecundity' of an explanation. We tend to see a theory as\nmore likely true the better it can unite seemingly disparate phenomena under one explanatory scheme.\nSurely this was part of the appeal of the Newtonian system, which offered the same basic force as an\nexplanation for affairs under and in the heavens. Aristotle, as we will discuss in Chapter 4, specifically\nrejects subject spanning explanations as adequately explanatory. 'Kind-crossing' explanations miss\nprecisely what is unique about the subject under explanation, and thus fail to yield true understanding of\nthe subject. A similar rejoinder may be entered against reductionist arguments. In the defense of distinct\nkinds that stands behind both of these rejections of principles that have proven so productive in modernity,\nlies an important key to the ancient view of knowledge, and subsidiary topics like definition.\n43 Meaning here 'stately' and, perhaps pompous.\n44 This is the fourth reason that Socrates has given for Meno's preference for this last definition. The two\nmiddle reasons are 'scientific' (ftnotes 56 and57) and the first and this one are more 'rhetorical.' There is\nsome tension between the two types of reasons; the scientific ones suggest that Meno goes so far in analysis\nthat he rejects natural kinds. The rhetorical reasons suggest that Meno follows habit, and therefore would\nbe unable to escape traditional, habitual categories, and may even 'romanticize' the categories he believes\nthings fall into, in order to make his beliefs impervious to reason. I think that Plato thinks the 'over-\nrational' and 'under-rational' are natural complements to each other. In the Symposium he represents this\ncomplementarity with the pairing of Phaedrus and Eruximachus.\n45 He does not make clear which one about skhema. Meno probably thinks he means the second,\n'technical' one, but, in contrast with the 'tragic' tone of his definition of color (built on the 'scientific'\ndefinition of skhema - footnote 59), Socrates is probably referring to his first simple and intuitive definition\nof shape, which is the only definition he has approved.\n\nforced to go away before the mysteries, as you said yesterday, and would only\nwait46 and be initiated.\n77 MENO: But I would stay, Socrates, if you would tell me many things such as\nthis47.\nSOCRATES: I will leave nothing undone in my eagerness to tell things such as\nthis, both for your sake and mine; but I fear I will not be able to tell you very many\nsuch things: but now you must attempt to reciprocate by making good on your\npromise to me, and tell, with respect to the whole of arete, what it is; and stop\nmaking many out of one, as the jokers say whenever something is shattered, but\nleaving it 'whole and healthy, 'tell me what arete is, following the patterns you\nB have taken from me.\nMENO: Then it seems to me, Socrates, that arete is, just as the poet says \"to\ncherish and have the capacity for kalon things.\"48 And I say that arete is desiring49\nkalon50 things and having the capacity to procure51 them for oneself.\nSOCRATES: Do you say that desiring kalon things is desiring good things?\nMENO: Exceedingly so.\n\n46 Perimeno: built on the verb meno (stay), which resembles Meno's name. Meno seems precisely to be the one who\nwill not wait, remain, or stay still. As we will see later with Deadalus' statues, the inability to stay still is precisely the\nmark of an opinion, as opposed to knowledge.\n47 The last definition, or color.\n48 I have translated this ambiguously because there is an arc in the use of language here. First only the\nword for capacity is used, then the phrase 'capacity for procuring' and later Socrates drops the word\ncapacity altogether (as well as the criterion of 'desiring kalon things'), and gets Meno to define arete as the\nprocuring of good things. In a dialogue that is about definition, it seems especially noteworthy that words\nare shifted and exchanged in the process. Socrates gets Meno to substitute 'good' for kalon,\nwant/will/choose for 'desire', 'unhappiness' for 'misery', and 'money and gold' for 'good things'. We\nshould also note that at 76E Socrates mentions that Prodicus, who he will later acknowledge as his teacher,\nwould have objected to his collapsing the meanings of 'limit' and 'boundary' (words which Aristotle, for\none, interchanges effortlessly. See xxxx). Some point is being made here about the nuances of words in\nthe process of definition. What do you think it is?\n49 The poet speaks of 'cherishing' (kharein) the kalon. Meno changes this to 'desiring', and uses a word\n(epithoumein) that expresses some of the lower senses of desire in Greek, used often for sexual lust and the\ndesire for food. It could be reasonably translated as 'having an appetite for'.\n50 It is ambiguous whether Meno means by this 'noble acts', as the poet clearly does or 'fine, beautiful\nthings'\n51 The word here is porizesthai, which is etymologically closely related to the words for flowing and\npassage used in the definition of shape that Meno likes and Socrates finds inferior, at 76c-d.\n\nSOCRATES: Then are there some who desire kakon things and others who\ndesire C good things? Or does it not seem to you that all, best of men, desire\ngood things?\nMENO: Not to me.\nSOCRATES: But some, kakon things?\nMENO: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Believing the kaka things to be good things, would you say; or\nknowing them to be kaka and desiring them all the same?\nMENO: Both, it seems to me.\nSOCRATES: And does it seem to you, Meno, that someone knowing kaka things\nto be kaka things, desires them all the same?\nMENO: Most certainly.\nSOCRATES: Desires how, would you say: To become his52?\nMENO: Yes, to become his. How else?\nD SOCRATES: And which of these two: supposing that kaka things will aid him\nwho possesses them, or knowing that the kaka will harm whoever obtains them?\nMENO: There are some who suppose that the kaka will aid them, and others who\nknow that the kaka will harm them.\nSOCRATES: And, do those who think that kaka things will aid them seem to you\nto know that they are kaka?\nMENO: This does not seem to me to be at all the case.\nSOCRATES: It is therefore clear that they do not desire kaka things, not\nknowing E them as such, but they supposed to be good those things which are\nkaka. Those who do not know them as such, supposing them to be good, clearly\ndesire the good. Or not?53\n\n52 The issue of 'possession' again. If we desire something, we want, in some sense, to possess it. Is the\nsame true of our desire for knowledge?\n53 Clearly Socrates has played a kind of trick on Meno here. It seems perfectly possible for Meno to\nmaintain that people can desire things that are 'morally evil' but benefit the possessor. Socrates is relying\non the ambiguity of the word kakon/kaka, as meaning both 'morally bad/evil\" and simply bad. It is almost\n\nMENO: That may possibly happen54 for those, at least.\nSOCRATES: Well then, those who, as you say, desire kaka, and think that kaka\nthings harm those they come to, know perhaps that they will be harmed by them?\n78 MENO: Necessarily\nSOCRATES: But do they not suppose that those who are harmed are miserable\nto the extent that they are harmed?\nMENO: This also necessarily.\nSOCRATES: Are not the miserable unhappy?\nMENO: I suppose so.\nSOCRATES: Is there anyone who wants55 to be miserable and unhappy?\nMENO: It does not seem so to me, Socrates.\nSOCRATES: Then no one wants kaka things, Meno, if they do not want to be\nlike that; for what else is misery but to desire kaka things and acquire them?\nMENO: You may very likely speak the truth56, Socrates, and no one wants kaka\nB things.\nSOCRATES: Accordingly, were you not saying just now that arete is wanting57\ngood things and having the capacity for them?\nMENO: I did say that.\nSOCRATES: Then having said this, the wanting already exists in everyone, and\nin this no one is better than another?\nMENO: So it appears.\n\na logical linguistic deduction that nobody would desire to 'possess' something that is 'bad'. The very\ndesire to possess it shows that they value it as good.\n54 Meno often responds to what seems like a necessary conclusion by implying that the conclusion is\nparticular, and the causality circumstantial (he has used this word, kinduneuo, before in his answers, suggesting\nthat this just 'happens' to be true, and is not a logical necessity. If one does not buy that some conclusions are logical\nimplications of other premises, then one certainly will have skepticism about our ability to know anything. His next\ntwo answers unequivocally recognize the necessity of Socrates' logic. Why do you think he changes his tune?\n55 Socrates switches here from 'desire' to boulomai, want, wish, or will. Why?\n56 kinduneueis , again. Meno will not fully commit to this answer.\n57 He did not say this. Meno said that arete is the desire (epithumia) for good things. Meno is indifferent\nbetween the two words.\n\nSOCRATES: Clearly, then, if one man is better than another, it is by virtue of his\nbeing stronger in his capacity?\nMENO: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: Then it seems to be like this: according to your reasoning, arete is\nC the capacity for procuring good things?\nMENO: It seems to me, Socrates, to hold58 wholly in the way you now apprehend\nit.\nSOCRATES: Then let us see whether you speak the truth about this; for you\nhave possibly spoken rightly:--You declare arete to be procuring good things59?\nMENO: I do.\nSOCRATES: Do you not call such as health and wealth good things?\nMENO: And to acquire gold and silver, and honor and rule in the city.\nSOCRATES: But do you not say that there are other good things?\nD MENO: No, but I mean all such things.\nSOCRATES: So be it, arete is the procuring of gold and silver; so says Meno, the\nhereditary guest-friend of the great king. But which of these two: would you add\nto this procuring 'justly and reverently', or does that not make a difference to you?\nBut even if someone procures them unjustly, would you equally call that arete?\nMENO: Perhaps not, Socrates.\nSOCRATES: But kakia?\nMENO: Maybe entirely so.\nSOCRATES: Then it is necessary, it would seem, to add to these procurings\nE justice or sophrosune or reverence, or some other part of arete: if not, it will\nnot be arete, even if it procures good things.\nMENO: Why, without these, how could arete come into being?\n\n58 Ekhein I think there is some sense here of heavily 'possessing' the whole of an idea. Meno seems to\nparadoxically believe both that we can either only speak of the part of something, and that we can fully\n'posses' the whole idea of it. Socrates, I think, wants to show that neither of these are true.\n59 Notice that Socrates has dropped 'the power/ability to'. We are at the bare, empirical bones here - no\ntheoretical power makes us virtuous, only the actual procurement of good things.\n\nSOCRATES: And to not procure gold and silver whenever it would not be just,\nneither for oneself nor for another; is not this non-procuring60 itself arete?\nMENO: So it appears.\nSOCRATES: Then the procurement of such goods is no more arete than the non-\nprocurement; but, as it seems, whatever comes into being with justice is arete ,\n79 and, without everything of that sort, kakia.\nMENO: It seems to me to be necessarily as you say.\nSOCRATES: Then, just a little earlier we said that each of them is a part of\narete, justice, sophrosune, and everything of that sort.\nMENO: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Then, Meno, you are making fun of me.\nMENO: How so, Socrates?\nSOCRATES: Just now I needed you to neither shatter arete nor mince it finely,\nand I gave you patterns according to which you should answer; you neglected this\nand you tell me that arete is the capacity for procuring good things with\nB justice, which you declare to be a part of arete.61\nMENO: I do.\nSOCRATES: Then it follows from these things you agree with62 that to do\nanything that one does with a part of arete, this is arete; for you declare justice,\n\n60 Aporia: this word is also used commonly in Plato to mean an intellectual impasse, which Socrates\nproclaims to be the origin of philosophy (). Starting back with his facetious Empedoclean definition of\ncolor (76c), meanings for 'flowing', and 'passages', 'procuring', and now the word for non-procuring\nwhich more commonly means a puzzle or intellectual impasse, are all drawn from the same root. Again, in\na dialogue which is about finding the true definition of something, we must ourselves wonder what Plato is\nup to in making these connections. We might start by wondering what this clause would mean if aporia\nhad its more common Platonic meaning : Is it 'arete itself' to be allow oneself to be in an intellectual\naporia?\n61 Is this a fair accusation? Once again, it is Socrates who has made the substitution of 'justice' for a list of\naretai earlier that seemed open-ended. Once again in our search for definition, Socrates allows words to\nseemingly slip in and out and substitute for each other without justification. Meno only goes along with\nhis whittling the aretai down to, or perhaps summing them up with, the term 'justice'. Is the list reducible\nin this way (see Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics xxx)? Is this similar to his collapse of the ideas of limit,\nboundary, and extremity earlier? And is it similar to the way he gets the slave boy to 'discover' his own\nideas?\n62 Homolegeis: We have been in search of the agreed upon starting point, the homologoumenon. See\nfootnotes 6, 47, 53, and 56.\n\nand also every such thing, to be a part of arete,. Why, then, do I say this?\nBecause, needing you to tell me the whole of arete, far from telling me that, you\ndeclare every act to be arete if only it is performed with a part of arete, as if you\nC had said what arete is as a whole and I already knew what it was63 even though\nyou had changed it into small coins. Therefore it seems to me that there is a need\nfor you to entertain the same question again and from the beginning (arkhe), Meno\nmy friend: What is arete, if every act performed with a part of arete is thereby\narete? For this is what they are saying, whenever someone says that every act\nperformed with justice is arete. Or does it not seem to you to return to the same\nquestion; rather do you suppose that someone can know what any part of arete is\nwhen he does not know what it is in itself?64\n.MENO: It does not seem so to me.\nD SOCRATES: If you remember when I answered you about skhema, we\nrejected any such answer that would try to respond by means of what is still\nsought and not yet agreed upon65?\nMENO: And we excluded them rightly, Socrates.\nSOCRATES: Then, best of men, don't you act accordingly and suppose that,\nwhile still seeking66 what the whole of arete is you will show anyone the answer\n\n63 As we shall see, it seems to be precisely the case that we must 'already know what X is' in some sense if\nwe are able to say that certain particulars are instances of X, and then seek out what the instances have in\ncommon so as to give the ti esti of X. This will be the only way out of Meno's zetetic paradox - there\nmust be foreknowledge of some sort. Perhaps this foreknowledge is inarticulable and 'intuitive'. See\nAristotle, Posterior Analytics II, 19 (99b15 ff.). The problem of regress in demonstration is similar to the\nzetetic paradox. Aristotle responds to those who claim: [1] All scientific knowledge comes only from\ndemonstration [2] There must be some initial premises which are not demonstrable, therefore [3] Scientific\nknowledge is impossible. His answer comes in the elaboration of the dunamis, nous. Our 'knowing' of\nthese initial premises is not an actual knowing, but a kind of capacity, or potentiality. Perhaps much like\nthe principle of contradiction is something that we 'know' in the sense that it is the very structure of\nthinking itself, though, as such, it is a priori indemonstrable.\n64 Notice that 'itself' or 'in itself' has taken the place of 'as a whole.'\n65 zetouMenon kai... homologeMenon: The later classic words for the two starting/ending points of the\ntwo types of mathematical investigation. See Ch. xxxxx\n66 zetoumenes\n\nE by means of the pieces of it, or by saying anything at all of this sort; but the\nsame question would again be necessary; In what you are saying, what is the being\nof this arete you are talking about? Or do I seem to you to be saying nothing?\nMENO: You seem to me to speak rightly.\nSOCRATES: Then answer again from the beginning (arkhe); what do both you\nand your comrade67 declare arete to be?\nMENO: O Socrates, I used to hear, before becoming acquainted with you, that\nyou would do nothing but stump yourself68 and make others stumped. But 80\nnow here's how you seem to me: you bewitch and drug and guilessly beguile me,\nuntil I have become filled with aporia. And you seem to me absolutely, even if it\nmust be put mockingly, to be a supreme resemblance, both in your eidos and other\naspects, of the flat torpedo fish69; for anyone approaching and touching it is\ninevitably made numb, and it seems to me that you have just now done something\nB like this to me; for truly my soul and my mouth are numb, and I am not able\nto70 answer you; Indeed, I have given myriad long speeches about arete to many\npeople, entirely well spoken, or so it had seemed to me. But now I am not even\nable to say (echo eipein) at all what it is71. And you seem to me to have\nconsidered well in not sailing away from here or going abroad, for if you should\ndo this sort of thing as a stranger in other cities, you would be taken off as a\nsorcerer.\nSOCRATES: You are a scoundrel, Meno, and have almost duped me.\nMENO: Really, in what way Socrates?\n\n67 i.e. Gorgias\n68 aporeis: the verb form of aporia. See footnote 75.\n69 Narke: literally this means 'numbness'.\n70 ekho: see footnote xx\n71 oud'....to parapan: not even...at all. [1] oude Meno thinks that being able to say what something is\nshould be the precondition to saying anything about it, which is certainly what Socrates has been trying to\nget him to see. But Meno also thinks that it should be the most elemental and easiest thing to do. Think\nback to the earlier passage from The Republic: we must climb up to a true hypothesis/definition, and only\nthen can we find the self-grounding basis of that definition, from which we can then reconstruct all that\nfalls out from it. [2] to parapan: see footnote 20. Meno admits here to being reduced to the condition that\nSocrates admitted to at the beginning of the dialogue, of not knowing at all what arete is.\n\nC SOCRATES: I understand why you made an image72 of me.\nMENO: Why, do you suppose?\nSOCRATES: That I might make an image of you in return. For I know\nthat all the kalon cherish having images made about them, for the images of the\nkalon are kalos; but I will not make an image of you in turn. As for me, if the\ntorpedo is itself numb as well as making others numb, then I am like one, but if\nnot, not; for I'm not clear about things73 myself when I stump others, but am\nmyself altogether more stumped, and thus I make others stumped. And now,\nD concerning arete, I do not know what it is; you probably knew earlier, before\nyou touched me, but now you resemble74 someone who does not know. All the\nsame, I want to carefully consider and seek out with you what it is.\nMENO: And in what way can you seek, Socrates, that of which you have\nabsolutely75 no idea what it is? For what sort of thing, of those you do not know,\nwill you put forward as what you will seek? Even if you stumbled right on it, how\nwould you know that it is that which you did not know?\nE SOCRATES: I ascertain76 what you wish to say, Meno, but you should see\nwhat an eristic argument you are bringing back to life: it follows that humans\ncannot seek either for that which they know, or that which they do not know; not\nfor what he knows, for he knows it, and there is no need for him to seek it. Not for\nwhat he does not know, for he would not even know what to seek.\n81 MENO: Then does it seem to you that the argument is beautifully stated,\nSocrates?\nSOCRATES: Not to me.\n\n72 Eikazo: literally to make an image, but here meaning creating a simile or comparison. The word eikon has\nimportant Platonic meanings, so I have translated it very literally.\n73 Euporeo: opposite of aporia, the word I have been translating as 'stumped'. Another in the family of poros words\nthat have so populated this dialogue. See footnotes 66, 75, 83\n74 homoios: same word used in Euclid to express geometric similarity.\n75 to parapan\n76 manthano: root meaning is 'I learn', related to the word mathematics - The concept of learning will soon\ntake a central place in the dialogue's understanding of knowledge.\n\nMENO: Are you able to say77 why?\nSOCRATES: Yes. For I have heard from men and women wise in divine\nmatters...\nMENO: Saying what?\nSOCRATES: True things, it seems to me, and kalon.\nMENO: What was it and who were the speakers?\nSOCRATES: Some of the speakers were priests and priestesses, who had studied\nhow they might give an account of the holy things in their care: Pindar speaks of it\nB also, and many other of the poets are in touch with divine things. What they say\nis this (consider whether it seems to you that they speak the truth): They declare\nthat the soul of man is immortal, and at one time it has an end, which they call\ndying, and at another time is born again, but it is never completely destroyed. It is\nnecessary, according to this, to live one's life through in the holiest of ways. For,\nfrom whom\n\nPersephone shall receive compensation for bloody ancient sin\nShe gives back their souls again to the sun above in the ninth year\nC From these grow illustrious kings and men of hot strength and great wisdom\nFor the rest of time they will be called purified heroes by men\n\nSince the soul has been born into this world many times, and has thus been seeing\nthe things of this world and the world below, there is nothing it has not learned.78\nNo wonder then that it can recollect about arete and other things, since it knew\nabout these things before; for all nature being akin, and the soul having learned all\nD things; nothing hinders someone, recalling (or, as people call it, learning) one\nthing only, from discovering all the rest himself, if only he has some courage and\n\n77 Ekheis eipein\n78 mematheken\n\ndoes not completely weary of seeking; for the whole of seeking and learning is\nrecollection. Therefore we must not be persuaded by these eristic arguments, for\nthis would make us lazy; they are sweet for soft people to hear; but the other way\nE makes us hard-working seekers. I, for one, am persuaded that this is true, and I\nwant to seek out with you what arete is.\nMENO: Yes, Socrates; but what do you mean by saying that we do not learn, and\nthat what we call learning is only recollection? Are you able to teach me how this\nis?\nSOCRATES: But, as I just said, Meno, you are a scoundrel, and now, when I\nsaid that there is no teaching, but only recollection, you ask if I am able to teach\nyou; in 82 that I would be directly revealed as contradicting myself.\nMENO: No, by Zeus, Socrates, I was not aware of what I was saying, but spoke\nfrom habit. But if you are able to show me how what you say holds, then show.\nSOCRATES: But it is not easy. All the same, I want to try eagerly for your\nsake..\nB But summon one of your many attendants to me, whoever you want, that I may\nshow it to you in him.\nMENO: Certainly. Come here.\nSOCRATES: He is Greek, and speaks Greek?79\nMENO: Most assuredly; he was born in my house.\nSOCRATES: Turn your attention to which of these two seems to happen:\nrecollecting, or learning from me.\nMENO: I will pay attention.\nSOCRATES: Tell me, boy, do you understand that a khorion like this is a\nsquare?\n\n79 He does not ask whether the slave boy can add and subtract- that is assumed. Why?\n\nBOY: I do.\nSOCRATES: Then, does a square khorion have all lines equal, the four of them?\nBOY: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: And also are not these through the middle equal?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Then may such a space not be greater or smaller?\nBOY: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: If, then, this side were two feet, and this two feet, how many feet\nwill the whole be? Consider this: if in this there are two feet, but in this one foot\nonly, the khorion would be two feet, once?\nD BOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: But since this also two feet, it is80 twice two feet?\nBOY: It is that.\nSOCRATES: It is twice two feet?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: How many are twice two feet? Calculate and tell me.\nBOY: Four, Socrates.\nSOCRATES: Could there not be another twice this khorion, the same as this,\nhaving all the lines equal just like this one?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: How many feet will that be?\nBOY: Eight.\nE SOCRATES: Come then, try to tell me what the pelikos81 of each line of that\none will be: for this one is two feet, what is it for the double [square]?\n\n80 gignomai: could also mean 'becomes'.\n\nBOY: It is clear, Socrates, that it is double.\nSOCRATES: Do you see, Meno, how I teach him nothing, but ask everything;\nbut now he supposes that he knows what sort82 of line generates an eight foot\n[square] khorion. Or does it not seem so to you?\nMENO: It does.\nSOCRATES: Then, does he know?\nMENO: Of course not.\nSOCRATES: But he at least imagines he knows, from the 'doubleness.'83\nMENO: True.\nSOCRATES: Observe him recollecting step by step, as it is necessary to\nrecollect. You, tell me: from the double line you say that the double khorion is\ngenerated?\n83 I mean as follows: not this [side] long and that [side] short, but it must be\neverywhere equal just like this one84, but double this, that is, eight feet [square];\nbut see if it still seems to you that it comes from the double line?\nBOY: It does to me.\nSOCRATES: Then does this line not become doubled if we add on another, the\nsame size, here?\n\nBOY: Certainly.\n\n81 Klein argues: \"...the word pelikos ...hints at the non-numerical character of the expected answer. In its\n'technical' meaning, the word pelikos refers mostly to continuous magnitudes (not to discrete units the assemblage\nof which form a 'number' and which we 'count'...) and implies, therefore, possible incommensurability.\" Socrates has\njust asked the boy to 'calculate' or count to arrive at the area. He will now be stymied in applying this most basic\narithmetic operation.\n82 Hopoion: Socrates specifically seems to be accusing the boy, not of thinking he knows the length of the\nside of the square with an 8 foot area, but of thinking he knows 'what sort' of line it is, suggesting that\nthere might be different sorts, or qualities of lines. This word becomes the Aristotelian category 'quality',\nso in terms, Socrates is asking about the quality rather than the quantity of the line.\n83 The slave boy is misunderstanding the notion, or the application, of the idea of analogy or proportion.\n84 The square of area four\n\nSOCRATES: From this, four lines of the same size, you say an eight foot khorion\nB will emerge?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Let us describe [a figure] from these four equal [lines]: Is there\nanything else, or is this what you declare to be the eight foot [square]?\nBOY: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: And are there not in it these four [areas], each of which is equal to\nthat of four feet?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Then how much is it? Is it not four times as large?\nBOY: How could it not be?\nSOCRATES: Then is four times as large double?\nBOY: No, by Zeus.\nSOCRATES: But how times?\nBOY: A multiple of four.85\nC SOCRATES: Then from the double, boy, not the double but the quadruple\nkhorion is generated.\nBOY: You speak the truth.\nSOCRATES: Four times four is sixteen. No?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: But from which line is the eight footer? Not from the one that\ngives a fourfold, I take it?\nBOY: It appears so.\nSOCRATES: And the four foot [figure] is from the half [line]?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Good; and is not the eight foot [space] double this, and half of\nthat?86\n\n85 Why does he put it in terms of multiples of four? Perhaps because that is the one common attribute of all\neven squares?\n\nBOY: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: Would it not come from a line larger than this one, and smaller\nthan that? Or not?\nBOY: This seems so to me.\nSOCRATES: Well said; Answer as it seems to you. And tell me, was this not a\nline of two feet but that of four?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Is it not necessary for the line of the eight foot khorion to be\ngreater than two feet, but less than four feet?\nBOY: It is necessary\nE SOCRATES: Try to say which pelikos87 you declare it to be.\nBOY: Three feet.\nSOCRATES: Then if we add a half to this line88, it will be three feet. This is\ntwo, while this is one; and on this side, in the same way, this is two and this one89\nand this gives birth to the khorion of which you speak?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Then if this is three and this three, the whole khorion becomes\nthree times three feet?\nBOY: Apparently.\nSOCRATES: Three times three is how many feet?\nBOY: Nine.\nSOCRATES: And how many feet did the double need to be?\nBOY: Eight.\nSOCRATES: Then from three feet we have still not produced the khorion of\neight feet?\n\n86 Double the four foot square and half the sixteen foot.\n87 See 82 E, Footnote 95\n88 the line two feet long\n89 Starting with the square of two, we take half again on one side and then repeat that on the adjacent side,\nthen complete the square with a three foot side.\n\nBOY: Of course not.\nSOCRATES: But from what?--try to tell us precisely; and if you do not want to\n84 count, then show from what90.\nBOY: But, by Zeus, Socrates, I, for one, do not know.\nSOCRATES: Are you discerning, Meno, how he is slowly moving forward in his\nrecollecting? At first he did not know which was the line of the eight foot\nkhorion, nor does he yet know, but then he supposed that he knew, and answered\nboldly as if he knew, and did not believe he was stumped91; now he believes he is\nstumped, and concomitant with his not knowing, neither B does he suppose that\nhe knows.\nMENO: You speak the truth.\nSOCRATES: Then he is in a better state with respect to the matter he did not\nknow?\nMENO: This seems so to me, as well.\nSOCRATES: Stumping him, just as the torpedo fish causes numbness, have we\nharmed him any?\nMENO: It does not seem so to me.\nSOCRATES: We have at any rate, given him some assistance, as it seems, in\ndiscovering what state he is in; now, not knowing, he will gladly seek, but then he\n\n90 This may be the richest and most significant line in the dialogue. First, rather than ask the length of the\nline which would produce the eight foot square, Socrates uses a word (poios) that has a deeper meaning of\n'what sort' - a word that in Aristotle's hands becomes the technical word for 'quality', as opposed to\nquantity. Socrates then demands 'precision' in identifying the line, but excuses the boy from counting\n(arithmein) - that is, from referring to numbers. (Klein notes that up until now the only answers the boy\nhas been asked to give are a yes or no, or the result of counting. Pg. 103) Rather, he allows the boy to\nsimply show or point to the 'sort' of line he means. We usually do not think that precision in mathematical\nmatters involves a retreat from numbers, and we are not accustomed to think of straight lines as being of\ndifferent sorts. Certainly there is no definition in Euclid of different sorts of straight lines. When we reach\nthe discussion of the irrational in chapter xxx, we will refer back to this passage, and the notion that greater\nprecision can sometimes be reached in mathematics when we do not consider the quantity but the sort or\nquality of the entity sought. For the question of the nature of definition now at hand, we might just notice\nthat a turn has been made in the search for this thing: we thought we knew its nature (a straight line), but\nonly lacked its measure. We are discovering that perhaps we do not know its nature, yet we can still pursue\nthis thing which we do not know (to parapan -at all?) through our clear sense of its difference from what\nwe do know.\n91 aporein\n\ncould easily suppose that he could speak well many times to many people92 about\nthe double khorion, saying that it is necessary for it to have a C line of double\nlength.\nMENO: It seems so.\nSOCRATES: But do you suppose that, not knowing, he would have tried to seek\nor to learn that which he supposed he knew before he had fallen into aporia\nthrough believing that he did not know, and had yearned to know?\nMENO: It does not seem so to me, Socrates.\nSOCRATES: Then he was benefited from the numbing?\nMENO: It seems so to me.\nSOCRATES: Note carefully that starting from this state of aporia, he will also\ndiscover by seeking with me. But from me will come nothing but questioning,\nD no teaching: Keep guard if you should at anytime find me teaching or\nexpounding to him, and not just asking for his opinions.\nNow you [to the boy] tell me; is this not our four footed khorion?[square A] Do\nyou understand?\n\nBOY: I do.\nA B\n\n92 a dig at Meno. See 80b2-3\n\nC D\nSOCRATES: And I add another one equal to it [ square B]?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: And a third, equal to each of them [square C]?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Then should we fill up the place in the corner93 [square D]?\nBOY: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: Nothing other than four equal khoria has come into being?\nE BOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Then how many times larger than this has the whole become?\nBOY: Four times.\nSOCRATES: But we needed it to become double, don't you remember?\nBOY: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: Then here is this line drawn from corner to corner; does it not 85\nslice each khorion in two?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Then four lines have come into being, equal and enclosing this\nkhorion?\nBOY: They have come into being.\nSOCRATES: Consider, then: What is the pelikon94 of this khorion.\nBOY: I do not understand.\n\n93 goniai: also means 'angle', as in 'trigonometry'\n94 See Footnote 96\n\nSOCRATES: Isn't it the case that each inside line95 cut each of the four spaces in\nhalf? Or not?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: And how many of this size are there in here [the middle section]?\nBOY: Four.\nSOCRATES: And how many in this [the first square]?\nBOY: Two.\nSOCRATES: And what is four in relation to two?\nBOY: Double\nB SOCRATES: And how many feet has this [the quadruple square] become?\nBOY: Eight feet.\nSOCRATES: From what line?\nBOY: From this96.\nSOCRATES: That is, from the line extending from corner to corner of the four\nfoot space?\nBOY: Yes.\nSOCRATES: The sophists call this the diameter97. So, if this has the name\ndiameter, then, as you say, boy of Meno, the double khorion is generated by98 the\ndiameter.\nBOY: That's certainly so, Socrates.\n\n95 That the side of the square of area 2 is an 'inside line' - something in the structure of the first square,\nrather than some sort of extension of the side of the original square has real significance for understanding\nwhat knowledge is and how it is sought out.\n96 From the diagonal of the original square.\n97 There has been a significant progression in the last few lines of dialogue. The boy, after being unable (as\nwe all would be) to identify the side of the double square by means of a number, simply points to the line\nwithin the original structure which plays that role perfectly. That is sufficient, and perhaps in the end the\nmost honest way we have of grasping this entity. Socrates then simply describes that line, which\nformalizes it in a way that does not do apparent violence to this original grasping. But finally he attributes\nto the sophists the accomplishment of naming the line. This may well be a less honest move, which\npretends to a level of understanding that we have not attained. It is reminiscent somewhat of the earlier\nEmpedoclean play with names that Socrates is clearly ridiculing as an imposter to understanding. See 76c\nff.\n98 another instance of gignomai\n\nSOCRATES: How does it seem to you, Meno? Did he answer with any doxa\nthat was not from him, himself?\nC MENO: No, they were all from him.\nSOCRATES: But, as we were saying a bit earlier, he did not know?\nMENO: You speak the truth.\nSOCRATES: Yet his doxai were inside99 him; or not?\nMENO: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Then someone who does not know, whatever his lack of\nknowledge concerns, may have inside him true doxai concerning those things\nthat he does not know?\nMENO: Apparently\nSOCRATES: And just now these doxai were awakened in him, as if in a\ndream; but if he were asked the same questions many times and in many\nways, you know that, finally, he will know about them no less precisely than\nanyone.\nD MENO: So it seems.\nSOCRATES: Then no one having taught him, but just having questioned\nhim, he will know, recovering the knowledge himself, from himself?\nMENO: Yes.\nSOCRATES: But to recover knowledge in himself, by himself, is to\nrecollect, no?\nMENO: Certainly\nSOCRATES: Is it not the case that he must either have acquired this\nknowledge which he now has at some time, or had it always?\nMENO: Yes.\n\n99 eneimi Can also mean to have something in one's power, much as we would say 'he has it in him to do\nX'. It seems no accident that Socrates moves from talking about the 'inside line' as the side of the double\nsquare, and the inside doxa as the basis of the boy's understanding. What do you make of this analogy?\n\nSOCRATES: Then if he always had it, he was always 'knowing'. If he\nacquired it at some time he did not acquire it in the present life Or has\nE someone taught him geometry? For he will do the same with all\ngeometrical matters, and with every other branch of learning. Then, is there\nanyone who has taught him all this? If that is possible, you would know,\nsince he was born and raised in your house.\nMENO: But I myself know that no one ever taught him.\nSOCRATES: He has these doxai, or not?\nMENO: Apparently he must, Socrates.\nSOCRATES: If he did not acquire them in the present life, is it not clear\nthat\n86 he had them and had learned them in some other time?\nMENO: Apparently.\nSOCRATES: Then this was the time when he was not a human being?\nMENO: Yes.\nSOCRATES: If, then in both the time that he was and was not a human\nbeing, true doxai were inside him100, which are awakened by questioning to\nbecome Knowledge(s), isn't it the case that his soul was in a state of 'having\nlearned'101 throughout all time? For it is clear that for all time he either is or\nis not a man?\nMENO: Apparently.\nSOCRATES: And if the truth of all beings is in our soul, then\n\n100 eneimi\n101 the more natural translation is 'understanding'. But it is interesting that at 86 a Plato specifically has\nSocrates claim not that we learned these things at another time, but that we had learned them. He seems to\nbe implicitly recognizing the regress implied: since all of this exposition is meant to answer Meno's\nchallenge that we can't search for what we don't know, because, not knowing it, we would not recognize it\nwhen we found it, there is some paradox in trying to establish that we would recognize it because we found\nit at some previous time. In fact, it would have to be that we never 'learned' this, but have always been in a\nstate of 'having learned' it. And, of course, if we have this knowledge through all time, then there was\nnever a moment in time when we learned it.\n\nB the soul is immortal. Wherefore be of good courage; what you do not\nhappen to know now - that is what you do not remember - you must try to\nseek out and recall.\nMENO: You seem to me to speak rightly, Socrates, though in what way, I\ndo not know.\nSOCRATES: I seem so to me, also, Meno. I can not confidently affirm the\nentirety of the argument. But I would battle wholeheartedly, as far as I am\nable, both in word and deed, that if we suppose we must seek after something\nwe do not know we will be better, braver and less slothful than if\nC we suppose that it is not possible to find, or that we are not obliged to\nseek, what we do not know102.\nMENO: Here also, Socrates, you seem to me to speak rightly.\nSOCRATES: Then, as we are of like mind that whatever someone does not\nknow is to be sought, should we together try our hands at seeking out what\narete is?\nMENO: Certainly, Socrates. And yet I, for one, would find it more pleasing\nto examine and hear what I first asked: whether we should attempt arete as\nsomething teachable or as something that we have by nature, or as coming to\nhumans in some other way?\nD\nSOCRATES: If I ruled not only myself but you, Meno, we would not have\nexamined whether arete is taught or not taught, until we had first sought out\n'what it is' in itself. But since you do not try to rule yourself, so that you can\nbe 'free', but try to rule me, and do rule me, I will yield to you, for is it not\nnecessary for me to do so? So it seems then that an investigation of the\n\n102 Bluck (Pg. 318) argues here that in answer to Meno's claim that it is not possible to seek after what we\ndo not know, Socrates has given us a scenario under which it is, in fact, possible. Socrates admits that he\nhas far from proven that his scenario is true, but now, given two claims that have not been, and perhaps\ncannot be proven, we are left with a 'moral decision' about which one to belief. Knowledge may not be\npossible here, so we are being asked to 'choose' a doxa. See also Phaedo 114d, 63b-c.\n\nE kind (poion) of the thing will happen when we do not yet know what it is.\nAt any rate, will you not relax your rule over me a little, and yield to an\nexamination 'from a hypothesis', of whether it is taught or comes in some\nother way? By 'from a hypothesis', I mean just this: when certain questions\nare put to them geometricians often examine them in this way; for instance,\nconcerning a khorion, asked whether this triangular khorion103 can be 87\ninscribed in this circle, they will say something like this: 'I do not know yet\nif this is the case; but believe I have a sort of 'hypothesis' useful in this\nmatter: If the khorion be such that when you apply it to the given line (of the\ncircle)104, it falls short by an area similar to the area so applied, then one\nconsequence follows, and if this is impossible then some other105. I want,\n\n103 Really, whether a certain area is capable of being inscribed as a triangle in a certain circle There are\nprobably 5 steps here: a particular khorion, the construction of a triangle that is equal to that khorion, the\nconstruction of a rectangle equal to the khorion and then the inscription of the triangle in a particular circle.\nThe transformation of space into different shapes was an important element of 'mathematical rationality\".\n104 i.e. the diameter of the circle. The exact nature of this mathematical problem is unclear.\n105 The exact nature of this mathematical problem is unclear. The simplest interpretation (Butcher, quoted\nin Bluck p. 443) is this:\n\nIf the khorion as applied to the diameter, as a rectangle ABCD, falls short of the entire rectangle ABHG by\na figure which is similar to ABCD, then D must fall on the circumference. This can be proven thus:\n\nIf ABCD is similar to CHGD then B.C. : CD :: CD : CH. By Euclid xx we know that triangle BDH is a\nright triangle. Now suppose that D did not fall on the circumference, thus:\n\nB then, to hypothesize and then tell you about the inscription of the area in\nthe circle, whether it is impossible or not.' Surely in this way, concerning\narete also, since we know neither what it is or nor what sort of thing it is, let\nus examine it, whether it is teachable or not, under a hypothesis, speaking\nthus, if arete is what sort of thing, among the entities of the soul, will it be\ntaught or not taught? First, if it is unlike or like knowledge, is it taught or\nnot, or, as we were just now saying, 'remembered'? Let's not argue C about\nwhich of the two names we should use, but is it taught? Or is it clear to all\nthat nothing other than knowledge is taught to humans?\nMENO: It seems so to me.\nSOCRATES: Then if arete is some kind of knowledge, it is clear that it\nwould be taught?\nMENO: How could it not?\n\nBy the above reasoning, we know that BDH is a right angle, but if we extend BD to the circumference at I,\nwe know by Euclid III xx that BIH is also a right angle. But if BDH is a right angle then HDI must also be\na right angle, and then triangle IDH will contain two right angles at it's base, which is impossible.\nTherefore D must be on the circumference. If it is on the circumference, then (diagram I) if we draw DC\nthrough to F, CF = CD, and triangle BFC = triangle BDC. BDC is half of the original khorion ABCD, so\ntriangle DBF is a triangle equal to the original khorion which is inscribed in the circle. The hypothesis then\nis that, if the area can be formed into a rectangle which when applied to the diameter leaves a similar figure\non the rest of the diameter, then a triangle equal to that khorion can be inscribed in the circle. It has not\nbeen shown that if the khorion does not meet this condition, a triangle equal to it cannot be so inscribed.\n\nSOCRATES: We have settled this quickly; that which is of this kind of\nbeing is taught, and of that kind is not.\nMENO: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: After this, it seems, it is necessary to investigate whether\narete is knowledge, or something other than knowledge.\nD MENO: This seems to me, at least, to be the next thing to investigate\nSOCRATES: Very well then, do we say that arete is something other than a\ngood; the hypothesis stands for us, that it is a good?\nMENO: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: Then , if there is some good which is other than and separable\nfrom knowledge, then it immediately follows that arete may not be a kind of\nknowledge, but if there is nothing good that is not encompassed by\nknowledge, then the suspicion that it is a kind of knowledge is the right\nsuspicion.\nMENO: That's so.\nSOCRATES: And it is through arete that we are good?\nMENO: Yes.\nE SOCRATES: But if good, then beneficial; for all good things\nare beneficial, no?\nMENO: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Then arete is beneficial?\nMENO: What we have agreed on106 necessitates that.\nSOCRATES: Let's examine, taking up each one, what kind of things are\nbeneficial to us. Health, we say, and strength, and beauty and wealth; surely\nwe say these and what is like these are beneficial, no?\n88 MENO: Yes.\n\n106 homologemonon\n\nSOCRATES: And yet we say the same things also sometimes harm, or do\nyou say otherwise?\nMENO: No, I say just that.\nSOCRATES: Consider what guides each of them into benefiting, when it\ndoes, or harming, whenever it does that. And what is the guiding principle\nwhich makes them beneficial or the reverse? Are they not beneficial when\nrightly used, and harmful when not?\nMENO: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: And now, let us consider matters of the soul; you call them\nsophrosune, justice, courage, quick learning, memory, magnanimity, and all\nsuch things?\nB MENO: I do.\nSOCRATES: Consider then, any of these that seem to you to not be\nknowledge, but something other than knowledge; do they sometimes harm\nand sometimes benefit? For example, courage; if it is not phronesis then\ncourage is only some kind of boldness. Is it not so that whenever a person is\nbold without thought he is harmed, but whenever accompanied by nous he is\nbenefited?\nMENO: Yes\nSOCRATES: And the same may be said of sophrosune and adeptness in\nlearning; instances of both learning (in the second case) and discipline (in the\nfirst) accompanied by nous are beneficial, but without nous are harmful?\nMENO: Most certainly.\nC SOCRATES: Then in sum, all of the attempts and endurings of the soul\nwhen led by phronesis should end in happiness; but by thoughtlessness in the\nopposite?\nMENO: It seems likely.\nSOCRATES: If then arete is something of the soul, and is of necessity\n\nbeneficial, it must itself be phronesis107, since all things concerning the soul\nare in themselves neither beneficial or harmful, but by being allied to\nD phronesis or thoughtlessness they become beneficial or harmful;\naccording to this reasoning arete, being beneficial, must be a sort of\nphronesis.\nMENO: It seems so to me.\nSOCRATES: And the other things which we were just now saying are\nsometimes good and sometimes harmful- wealth and the like - is it not just as\nwhen phronesis led the rest of the soul, it made the things of the soul\nbeneficial, but when thoughtlessness led, harmful; in this way again, both\nE using and guiding such things rightly the soul makes them beneficial, but\nnot rightly, harmful?\nMENO: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: The sensible soul guides rightly, and the foolish soul misses\nthe mark?\nMENO: It is so.\nSOCRATES: Then can we say this in every case? For humans, all other\nthings are hung on the soul, and the things of the soul itself on phronesis, if\n89 it is to do good; and so by this reasoning phronesis would be the\nbeneficial--and we declare arete to be beneficial?\nMENO: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: And we declare arete to be phronesis, either all of the latter or\nsome part of it?108\nMENO: What you are saying seems to me, Socrates, beautifully stated.\n\n107 This implies that arete is not like learning or discipline, something which must be accompanied by\nphronesis in order to be beneficial, but is the same kind of thing as the supplement. It is what leads or\nguides modes of apprehension or action, rather than itself a mode of apprehending or acting in the world.\n108 The argument is that if phronesis is the beneficial, and arete is beneficial, then arete is at least a part of\nphronesis if not equivalent to it.\n\nSOCRATES: But if this holds, then the good are not so by nature?\nMENO: It does not seem so to me.\nB SOCRATES: And I suppose there is this, also: if the good had come into\nbeing by nature, we should have had among us those who can perceive who\nof the young are good by nature, and we would have adopted109 them, and\nwhen we had got them, we would have kept watch over them in the\nAcropolis, sealing them in many times better than a piece of gold, in that\nplace no one would corrupt them; but when they came of age they would\nbecome useful to their cities.\nMENO: That seems likely to me, Socrates\nSOCRATES: Then surely since it is not by nature that the good become\nC good, is it through learning?\nMENO: At this point, this seems to me to be necessary, and clearly,\nSocrates, according to the hypothesis, if arete is knowledge, then it is\ntaught110 .\nSOCRATES: Possibly, by God; but what if this was not rightly agreed\nupon111?\nMENO: But it seemed to me just now to be finely stated.\nSOCRATES: But it needs to seem finely stated not only 'just now', but in\n'the now and the then', if there is any soundness in it.\nD MENO: What's this then? What is it that you can see in it that\ndissatisfies you and makes you suspect that arete is not knowledge?\nSOCRATES: I will tell you, Meno. That it is taught, if it is knowledge, I do\nnot take back the assertion that this was finely stated; but consider whether it\n\n109 Paralambano: could also mean 'take prisoner'.\n110 Socrates has just demonstrated that arete is phronesis, not that it is knowledge. Further, the first part of\nthe dialogue purported to show that knowledge may be something that is learned, but may not be taught.\n111 Homologesamen: again, this has not been agreed on at all, and has not operated as a homologoumenon\nof the demonstration.\n\nought to seem doubtful to you that it is knowledge. Tell me this: if any\nmatter whatsoever is teachable, not arete alone, is it not necessary for there to\nbe teachers and learners of it?\nMENO: It seems so to me.\nE SOCRATES: Then, again, to the contrary, if there is something of which\nthere are neither teachers nor learners, would it be a right inference if we\nwere to infer that it is not teachable?\nMENO: That's so; but does it seem to you that there are no teachers of\narete?\n\nSOCRATES: I have, at any rate, often sought out whether there were any\nteachers of it but, doing everything, I have not been able to discover any, and\nindeed I have searched with many - with those I supposed to be the most\nexperienced in the matter. And now, Meno, just at the right time, Anytus has\nsat down near us, let's give him a share of the search112. It's reasonable that\n90 we should give him a share. For, first, Anytus is son of a wealthy and\nwise father, who did not come to be wealthy through chance or some gift,\nlike Ismenias the Theban, who has recently received the wealth of\nPolycrates, but acquired through his own wisdom and care; next, he113 seems\nto be a citizen who is neither haughty nor puffed up and oppressive, but is an\nB orderly and well-mannered man; then, he trained and educated him well,\nor so it seems to the majority of Athenians: for they elect him to the highest\noffices. It is right to seek out114 with such men whether there are or are not\nteachers of arete, and who they might be. Therefore, will you seek out115\n\n112 zeteseos\n113 it's not clear here whether Socrates is speaking of Anytus or his father\n114 zetein\n115 suzeteson\n\nwith us, your guest-friend Meno and myself, who the teachers of this matter\nmight be? Consider it like this: If we wished Meno to become a good\nC doctor, to which teachers would we send him? Would it not be to the\ndoctors?\nANYTUS: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: What if we wished him to be a good cobbler, would it not be\nto the cobblers?\nANYTUS: Yes.\nSOCRATES: And others thus?\nANYTUS: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: Returning to these matters, tell me this. We stated rightly that\nwhen we wish them to become doctors, we should send them to doctors,:\nwhen saying this, are we saying that we are being sensible in sending him to\nD those who lay claim to the techne, rather than to those who do not, and to\nthose who exact a fee for this itself, making their teaching known all who\nwish to come and learn? Looking to such things, would we not send them\nrightly?\nANYTUS: Yes.\nSOCRATES: Then the same for flute playing, and other such things?\nE Wishing to make someone a flute player, it is very foolish to not want to\nsend him to to those who profess to teach the techne and who exact a fee, but\nto trouble some others who neither purport to be teachers nor have any\nstudents of the branch of learning that we think it worthwhile for him to\nlearn, for which we are sending him? Does this not seem to you much\nalogia?\n\nANYTUS: Yes, by Zeus, it seems so to me; and ignorance116 too.\nSOCRATES: Well said. Now, then, you are in a position to ally with me in\n91 deliberating about this guest-friend of yours, Meno. For the fact is,\nAnytus, he has long been telling me that he desires117 the wisdom (Sophia)\nand arete by which people manage homes and cities well, and care for their\nparents, and know how to receive and to send away citizens and guest-friends\nas is worthy of a good man118. Consider, then, to whom should we send him\nfor B this arete - correctly send him, that is. Or is it not clear from the\nprevious reasoning that it is to those who purport to be teachers of arete and\nmake it known that they are readily available to anyone in Greece who wants\nto learn , charging a settled fee for this?\nANYTUS: But of whom do you speak, Socrates?\nSOCRATES: Surely you also know, that these are those whom people call\nSophists?\nC ANYTUS: By Heracles, Socrates, keep a sacred silence! Let none of my\nrelatives nor friends, neither citizen nor foreigner119, be taken by such\nmadness as to go and be deformed by them; for they are plainly a\ndeformation and destruction of all who associate with them.\n\nSOCRATES: What are you saying, Anytus? Are these of all the people\nwho profess that they know how to do men good, do you mean to say that\nthese are the only ones who not only do them no good, but positively corrupt\n\n116 amathia: literally, unlearned, or showing lack of learning.\n117 Epithumei: Plato could have said that Meno wished or wanted wisdom, but he uses a more base word -\none that in the Republic designates the lowest region of the soul. The word here could mean 'has an\nappetite for..\". It is especially jarring because Socrates has just asked Anytus to 'deliberate' with him -\nthey are apparently deliberating about Meno's appetites.\n118 Meno never claimed that he wants to learn this, and it seems an odd thing to list as an essential of arete.\nWe do know he is the guest friend of Anytus, and there seems some implication that Anytus has not\nconsidered when is the right time to invite or send away foreign guests.\n119 Xenon: same word used to describe Meno as his 'guest-friend'.\n\nD those who are entrusted to them, and in return for this kakia have the face\nto demand money? Indeed, I cannot believe you; for I know of a single man,\nProtagoras, who made more out of his craft than the illustrious Pheidias, who\ncreated such noble works, or any ten other statuaries. How could that be? A\nmender of old shoes, or patcher up of clothes, who made the shoes or clothes\nworse than he received them, could not have remained E thirty days\nundetected, and would very soon have starved; whereas during more than\nforty years, Protagoras was corrupting all Hellas, and sending his disciples\nfrom him worse than he received them, and he was never found out. For, if I\nam not mistaken, he was about seventy years old at his death, forty of which\nwere spent in the practice of his profession; and during all that time he had a\ngood reputation, which to this day he retains: and not only Protagoras,\n92 but many others are well spoken of; some who lived before him, and\nothers who are still living. Now, when you say that they deceived and\ncorrupted the youth, are they to be supposed to have corrupted them\nknowingly or unawares? Can those who were deemed by many to be the\nwisest men of Hellas have been out of their minds?\n\nANYTUS: Out of their minds! No, Socrates; the young men who gave their\nmoney to them were out of their minds, and their relations and guardians\nB who entrusted their youth to the care of these men were still more out of\ntheir minds, and most of all, the cities who allowed them to come in, and\ndid not drive them out, citizen and stranger alike.\n\nSOCRATES: Has any of the Sophists wronged you, Anytus? What makes\nyou so angry with them?\n\nANYTUS: No, indeed, neither I nor any of my belongings has ever had, nor\nwould I suffer them to have, anything to do with them.\n\nSOCRATES: Then you are entirely (pantapasi) unacquainted (apeiras)\nwith them120?\n\nANYTUS: And I have no wish to be acquainted.\n\nC\nSOCRATES: Then, my dear friend, how can you know whether a thing is\ngood or bad of which you are completely inexperienced (pantapasi apeiras)?\nANYTUS: Quite well; I am sure that I know what manner of men these are,\nwhether I am acquainted with them or not.\n\nSOCRATES: You must be a diviner, Anytus, for I really cannot make out,\njudging from your own words, how, if you are not acquainted with them, you\nknow about them. But I am not enquiring of you who are the teachers who\nwill corrupt D Meno (let them be, if you please, the Sophists); I only ask\nyou to tell him who there is in this great city who will teach him how to\nbecome eminent in the arete which I was just now describing. He is the\nfriend of your family, and you will oblige him.\n\nANYTUS: Why do you not tell him yourself?\n\nSOCRATES: I have told him whom I supposed to be the teachers of these\nthings; but I learn from you that I am utterly at fault, and I dare say\nE that you are right. And now I wish that you, on your part, would tell me\nto whom among the Athenians he should go. Whom would you name?\n\n120 This accusation brings to mind Socrates' earlier question of how he could know if someone is beautiful\nif absolutely (to parapan) did not know him. This does not seem to trouble Anytus.\n\nANYTUS: Why name one of the people? Any Athenian gentleman121, taken\nat random, if he will mind him, will do far more good to him than the\nSophists.\n\nSOCRATES: And did those gentlemen grow of themselves; and without\nhaving been taught by any one, were they nevertheless able to teach others\nthat which they had never learned themselves?\n\nANYTUS: I imagine that they learned of the previous generation of\ngentlemen. Have there not been many good men in this city?\n\nSOCRATES: Yes, certainly, Anytus; and many good statesmen also there\nalways have been and there are still, in the city of Athens. But the question is\nwhether they were also good teachers of their own arete ;--not whether there\nare, or have been, good men in this part of the world, but whether arete can\nB be taught, is the question which we have been discussing. Now, do we\nmean to say that the good men of our own and of other times knew how to\nimpart to others that arete which they had themselves; or is arete a thing\nincapable of being communicated or imparted by one man to another? That\nis the question which I and Meno have been arguing. Look at the matter in\nC your own way: Would you not admit that Themistocles was a good man?\n\nANYTUS: Certainly; no man better.\n\nSOCRATES: And must not he then have been a good teacher, if any man\never was a good teacher, of his own arete ?\n\n121 Kalon kagathon the 'noble (beautiful) good' people. This phrase elides the question of whether the\nkalon is agathon, which comes up here and in The Symposium.\n\nANYTUS: Yes certainly, if he wanted to be so.\n\nSOCRATES: But would he not have wanted? He would, at any rate, have\ndesired to make his own son a good man and a gentleman; he could not have\nbeen jealous of him, or have intentionally abstained from imparting to him\nD his own arete . Did you never hear that he made his son Cleophantus a\nfamous horseman; and had him taught to stand upright on horseback and hurl\na javelin, and to do many other marvelous things; and in anything which\ncould be learned from a master he was well trained? Have you not heard\nfrom our elders of him?\n\nANYTUS: I have.\n\nSOCRATES: Then no one could say that his son showed evidence of a bad\nnature?\nE\nANYTUS: Very likely not.\n\nSOCRATES: But did any one, old or young, ever say in your hearing that\nCleophantus, son of Themistocles, was a wise or good man, as his father\nwas?\n\nANYTUS: I have certainly never heard anyone say so.\n\nSOCRATES: And if arete could have been taught, would his father\nThemistocles have sought to train him in these minor accomplishments, and\nallowed him who, as you must remember, was his own son, to be no better\nthan his neighbors in those qualities in which he himself excelled?\n\nANYTUS: Indeed, indeed, I think not.\n\nSOCRATES: Here was a teacher of arete whom you admit to be among the\nbest men of the past. 94A Let us take another, Aristides, the son of\nLysimachus: would you not acknowledge that he was a good man?\n\nANYTUS: To be sure I should.\n\nSOCRATES: And did not he train his son Lysimachus better than any other\nAthenian in all that could be done for him by the help of masters? But\nwhat has been the result? Is he a bit better than any other mortal? He is\nan acquaintance of yours, and you see what he is like. B There is Pericles,\nagain, magnificent in his wisdom; and he, as you are aware, had two sons,\nParalus and Xanthippus.\n\nANYTUS: I know.\n\nSOCRATES: And you know, also, that he taught them to be unrivalled\nhorsemen, and had them trained in music and gymnastics and all sorts of\narts--in these respects they were on a level with the best--and had he no\nwish to make good men of them? Nay, he must have wished it. But arete ,\nas I suspect, could not be taught. And that you may not suppose the\nincompetent teachers to be only the meaner sort of Athenians and few in\nnumber, remember again that Thucydides had two sons, Melesias and\nStephanus, whom, besides giving them a good education in other things, he\ntrained in wrestling, and they were the best wrestlers in Athens: one of\nthem he committed to the care of Xanthias, and the other of Eudorus, who\nhad the reputation of being the most celebrated wrestlers of that day. Do\nyou remember them?\n\nANYTUS: I have heard of them.\n\nSOCRATES: Now, can there be a doubt that Thucydides, whose children\nwere taught things for which he had to spend money, would have taught them\nD to be good men, which would have cost him nothing, if arete could have\nbeen taught? Will you reply that he was a mean man, and had not many\nfriends among the Athenians and allies? Nay, but he was of a great family,\nand a man of influence at Athens and in all Hellas, and, if arete could have\nbeen taught, he would have found out some Athenian or foreigner who would\nhave made good men of his sons, if he could not himself spare the time from\nE cares of state. Once more, I suspect, friend Anytus, that arete is not a\nthing which can be taught?\n\nANYTUS: Socrates, I think that you are too ready to speak kakon of men:\nand, if you will take my advice I would recommend you to be careful.\nPerhaps there is no city in which it is not easier to do men harm than to\ndo them good, and this is certainly the case at Athens, 95A as I believe that\nyou know.\n\nSOCRATES: Oh Meno, I think that Anytus is in a rage. And he may well\nbe in a rage, for he thinks, in the first place, that I am defaming these\ngentlemen; and in the second place, he is of opinion that he is one of them\nhimself. But some day he will know what is the meaning of defamation, and\nif he ever does, he will forgive me. Meanwhile I will return to you, Meno;\nfor I suppose that there are gentlemen in your region too?\n\nMENO: Certainly there are.\nB\n\nSOCRATES: And are they willing to teach the young? and do they profess\nto be teachers? and do they agree that arete is taught?\n\nMENO: No indeed, Socrates, they are anything but agreed; you may hear\nthem saying at one time that arete can be taught, and then again the reverse.\n\nSOCRATES: Can we call those teachers who do not acknowledge the\npossibility of their own vocation?\nC\nMENO: I think not, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES: And what do you think of these Sophists, who are the only\nprofessors? Do they seem to you to be teachers of arete?\n\nMENO: I often wonder, Socrates, that Gorgias is never heard promising to\nteach arete : and when he hears others promising he only laughs at them;\nbut he thinks that men should be taught to speak.\n\nSOCRATES: Then do you not think that the Sophists are teachers?\n\nMENO: I cannot tell you, Socrates; like the rest of the world, I am in\ndoubt, and sometimes I think that they are teachers and sometimes not.\n\nSOCRATES: And are you aware that not only you and other politicians\nhave doubts whether arete can be taught or not, but that Theognis the poet\nD says the very same thing?\n\nMENO: Where does he say so?\n\nSOCRATES: In these elegiac verses (Theog.):\n\n'Eat and drink and sit with the mighty, and make yourself agreeable to\nthem; for from the good you will learn what is good, but if you mix with\n\nE the bad you will lose the intelligence which you already have.'\n\nDo you observe that here he seems to imply that arete can be taught?\n\nMENO: Clearly.\n\nSOCRATES: But in some other verses he shifts about and says (Theog.):\n\n'If understanding could be created and put into a man, then they' (who were\nable to perform this feat) 'would have obtained great rewards.'\n\nAnd again:\n96A\n'Never would a bad son have sprung from a good sire, for he would have\nheard the voice of instruction; but not by teaching will you ever make a\nbad man into a good one.'\n\nAnd this, as you may remark, is a contradiction of the other.\n\nMENO: Clearly.\n\nSOCRATES: And is there anything else of which the professors are\naffirmed not only not to be teachers of others, but to be ignorant themselves,\nand bad at the knowledge of that which they are professing to teach? or is\n\nB there anything about which even the acknowledged 'gentlemen' are\nsometimes saying that 'this thing can be taught,' and sometimes the opposite?\nCan you say that they are teachers in any true sense whose ideas are in such\nconfusion?\n\nMENO: I should say, certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES: But if neither the Sophists nor the gentlemen are teachers,\nclearly there can be no other teachers?\n\nMENO: No.\nC\nSOCRATES: And if there are no teachers, neither are there pupils122?\n\nMENO: Agreed.\n\nSOCRATES: And we have admitted that a thing cannot be taught of which\nthere are neither teachers nor disciples?\n\nMENO: We have.\n\nSOCRATES: And there are no teachers of arete to be found anywhere?\n\nMENO: There are not.\n\nSOCRATES: And if there are no teachers, neither are there scholars?\n\nMENO: That, I think, is true.\n\n122 Literally 'learners'\n\nSOCRATES: Then arete cannot be taught?\nD\nMENO: Not if we are right in our view. But I cannot believe, Socrates,\nthat there are no good men: And if there are, how did they come into\nexistence?\n\nSOCRATES: I am afraid, Meno, that you and I are not good for much, and\nthat Gorgias has been as poor an educator of you as Prodicus has been of\nme. Certainly we shall have to look to ourselves, and try to find some one\nwho will help in some way or other to improve us. This I say, because I\nobserve that in the previous search (zetesis) none of us remarked that right\nand good action is possible to man under other guidance than that of\nknowledge (episteme); and indeed if this be denied, there is no seeing how\nthere can be any good men at all.\n\nMENO: How do you mean, Socrates?\n\nSOCRATES: I mean that good men are necessarily useful or beneficial.\n97A Were we not right in admitting this? It must be so.\n\nMENO: Yes.\n\nSOCRATES: And in supposing that they will be useful only if they are true\nguides to us of action--there we were also right?\n\nMENO: Yes.\n\nSOCRATES: But when we said that a man cannot give right guidance\nunless he possesses sagacity(phronemos), this we were wrong.\n\nMENO: What do you mean by the word 'right'?\n\nSOCRATES: I will say. Knowing the road to Larissa123, or anywhere else you\nwish, if someone wanted to go there and lead others, he could guide another rightly\nand well?\nMENO: Certainly.\nB SOCRATES: And what if someone is rightly opining the road, but had\nnever gone and did not know it, could he not guide correctly?\nMENO: Certainly.\nSOCRATES: And so long as he should have right opinion concerning that which\nthe other knows, he will be no worse a guide supposing the truth but not\nunderstanding, as he who understands?\nMENO: No worse\nSOCRATES: Then true opinion is no worse a guide to rightness of action than\nwisdom124; and this is what we left out just now when, considering what\nC sort of thing arete is, we said that wisdom alone guides right action; there is\nalso true opinion.\nMENO: It seems so.\nSOCRATES: Then right opinion is not less beneficial than knowledge?\nMENO: Just this much, Socrates: one having knowledge will always hit the mark;\nbut he who has right opinion will sometimes hit it, and sometimes not.\n\n123 Larissa is the abode of Meno's lover Aristippus, and also the place where Gorgias visited and added\nwisdom to the Thessalians' traditional 'virtues' of wealth and horsemanship. See 70b Q.2.zz Plato chooses\nthe road to Larissa, a place that has been given a specific meaning at the beginning of the dialogue, to\nrepresent that which we know without knowing. What hint is he giving us about this kind of knowing?\n124 Phroneseos: the word suggests practical or ethical wisdom. In the last paragraph phronon and\nphronountos could only be translated as 'understanding', but they clearly are sliding towards this idea of\nwisdom. One of the sub-themes in the dialogue is the question of whether knowledge is wisdom, or\nwisdom requires something else. The substitution of this word for knowledge also moves the example in\nthe moral direction.\n\nSOCRATES: What do you mean? Wouldn't the one who always has right opinion\nalways hit the mark, so long as he has opines rightly?\nMENO: That's necessary, it appears to me: therefore, Socrates, I wonder that\nknowledge should ever be much more valued than right opinion, and\nD what makes them different from each other.\nSOCRATES: Do you know the reason why you wonder? Shall I tell you?\nMENO: Tell me, certainly.\nSOCRATES: It is because you have not paid attention to the statues of Daedalus;\nbut perhaps there are none in your parts?\nMENO: You are saying this with regard to what?\nSOCRATES: Because of this: when they are not bound, they escape and run away,\nwhen bound, they stand fast.\nE MENO: So what?\nSOCRATES: I mean to say that they are not very valuable possessions if\nthey are at liberty, for they will walk off like runaway slaves; but when\nfastened, they are of great value, for they are really beautiful works of\nart. Now this is an illustration of the nature of true opinions: while\nthey abide with us they are beautiful and fruitful, but they run away out\nof the human soul, and do not remain long, and therefore they are not of\n98A much value until they are fastened by the tie of the cause; and this\nfastening of them, friend Meno, is recollection, as you and I have agreed\nto call it. But when they are bound, in the first place, they have the\nnature of knowledge; and, in the second place, they are abiding. And this\nis why knowledge is more honorable and excellent than true opinion,\nbecause fastened by a chain.\n\nMENO: What you are saying, Socrates, seems to be very like the truth.\nB\nSOCRATES: I too speak rather in ignorance; I only conjecture. And yet\n\nthat knowledge differs from true opinion is no matter of conjecture with\nme. There are not many things which I profess to know, but this is most\ncertainly one of them.\n\nMENO: Yes, Socrates; and you are quite right in saying so.\n\nSOCRATES: And am I not also right in saying that true opinion leading the\nway perfects the work of action quite as well as knowledge?\n\nMENO: There again, Socrates, I think you are right.\n\nSOCRATES: Then right opinion is not a whit inferior to knowledge, or less\nuseful in action; nor is the man who has right opinion inferior to him who\nhas knowledge?\n\nMENO: True.\n\nSOCRATES: And surely the good man has been acknowledged by us to be\nuseful?\n\nMENO: Yes.\n\nSOCRATES: Seeing then that men become good and useful to states, not\nonly because they have knowledge, but because they have right opinion, and\nthat neither knowledge nor right opinion is given to man by nature or\nacquired by him, do you imagine either of them to be given by nature?\n\nMENO: Not I.\n\nSOCRATES: Then if they are not given by nature, neither are the good by\nnature good?\n\nMENO: Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES: And nature being excluded, then came the question whether\narete is acquired by teaching?\n\nMENO: Yes.\n\nSOCRATES: If arete was phronesis, then, as we thought, it was taught?\n\nMENO: Yes.\n\nSOCRATES: And if it was taught it was phronesis?\n\nMENO: Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES: And if there were teachers, it might be taught; and if there\nwere no teachers, not?\n\nMENO: True.\n\nSOCRATES: But surely we agreed (homologekamen) that there were no\nteachers of arete?\n\nMENO: Yes.\n\nSOCRATES: Then we agreed (homologekamen) that it was not taught, and\nwas not phronesis?\n\nMENO: Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES: And yet we agreed (homologoumen) that it was a good?\n\nMENO: Yes.\n\nSOCRATES: And the right guide is useful and good?\n\nMENO: Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES: And the only right guides are knowledge and true opinion--\nthese are the guides of man; for things which happen by chance are not under\nthe guidance of man: but the guides of man are true opinion and knowledge.\n\nMENO: I think so too.\n\nSOCRATES: But if arete is not taught, neither is arete knowledge.\n\nMENO: Clearly not.\n\nSOCRATES: Then of two good and useful things, one, which is knowledge,\nhas been set aside, and cannot be supposed to be our guide in political life.\n\nMENO: I think not.\n\nSOCRATES: And therefore not by any wisdom, and not because they were\nwise, did Themistocles and those others of whom Anytus spoke govern\nstates. This was the reason why they were unable to make others like\nthemselves--because their arete was not grounded on knowledge.\n\nMENO: That is probably true, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES: But if not by knowledge, the only alternative which remains\nis that statesmen must have guided states by right opinion, which is in\npolitics what divination is in religion; for diviners and also prophets say\nmany things truly, but they know not what they say.\n\nMENO: So I believe.\n\nSOCRATES: And may we not, Meno, truly call those men 'divine' who,\nhaving no understanding, yet succeed in many a grand deed and word?\n\nMENO: Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES: Then we shall also be right in calling divine those whom we\nwere just now speaking of as diviners and prophets, including the whole tribe\nof poets. Yes, and statesmen above all may be said to be divine and\nillumined, being inspired and possessed of God, in which condition they say\nmany grand things, not knowing what they say.\n\nMENO: Yes.\n\nSOCRATES: And the women too, Meno, call good men divine--do they\nnot? And the Spartans, when they praise a good man, say 'that he is a divine\nman.'\n\nMENO: And I think, Socrates, that they are right; although very likely our\nfriend Anytus may take offence at the word.\n\nSOCRATES: I do not care; as for Anytus, there will be another opportunity\nof talking with him. To sum up our enquiry--the result seems to be, if we\nare at all right in our view, that arete is neither natural nor acquired,\nbut an divine dispensation (theia moira) without understandin (nou) to the\nvirtuous, unless there may be supposed to be among statesmen some one who\nis capable of educating statesmen. And if there be such an one, he may be\nsaid to be among the living what Homer says that Tiresias was among the\ndead, 'he alone has understanding; but the rest are flitting shades'; and he and\nhis arete in like manner will be a reality among shadows.\n\nMENO: That is excellent, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES: Then, Meno, the conclusion is that arete comes to the\nvirtuous by the gift of God. But we shall never know the certain truth until,\nbefore asking how arete is given, we enquire into the actual nature of arete .\nI fear that I must go away, but do you, now that you are persuaded yourself,\npersuade our friend Anytus. And do not let him be so exasperated; if you can\nconciliate him, you will have done good service to the Athenian people.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nES.113 Ancient Greek Philosophy and Mathematics\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "STUDY GUIDE (Questions to think about while you read):\n\nI. Knowing\n\nA. Knowledge as power/knowledge as virtue\n\n1] Schleirmacher wrote: \"...it is here in Plato's philosophy that form and content are inseparable.\"\nThe dialogue, he argued, forms a whole, a complete pattern, and the parts cannot be properly\nunderstood out of context, and without understanding of the pattern of the whole. The choice of\nPlato to present his philosophy in the form of a story or play has something to do with the Greek\nconception of knowledge. The truth about our relationship to this kosmos cannot be told adequately\nas a series of proofs, or in the form of a treatise [Aristotle, as well, presented all of his polished work\nin the form of dialogues. What we have of Aristotle is only his lecture notes]. What does it say\nabout Plato's understanding of knowledge that he chooses this style of presentation [note also that\ntoday no 'philosopher' could get a dialogue published in any journal addressed to other\nphilosophers- what does this say about our change of attitude?].\n\n2] What is knowledge in the dialogue Meno? You can think about this both from the perspective of\nwhat is said in the dialogue, and what happens in the dialogue. There may be competing answers:\ncan you reconcile them?\n\n3] Why is a mathematical example chosen to illustrate the supposed theory of knowledge Socrates is\nexpounding? Why this particular mathematical example?\n\n4] Why is this particular mathematical example chosen to illustrate our pursuit of knowledge of\narete [virtue, human excellence]\n\n5] Socrates asks if we can know whether Meno is handsome or well born if we are entirely ignorant\nof who he is. Is this a good analogy for our position with respect to human excellence?\n\n6] Consider these quotes from some of the founders of modernity, and put them together to form a\ntheory [or, if more than one is implied, theories] of knowledge. From what you've seen in Meno,\nhow do you think Plato would respond to these quotes, and the conception[s] of knowledge that lie\nbehind them?\n\na] Knowledge and human power are synonymous. Francis Bacon\nb] The Great End of life is not Knowledge but Action. Francis Bacon\nc] Science is the knowledge of consequences, and dependence of one fact upon another. Thomas\nHobbes\nd] No man's knowledge here can go beyond his experience. John Locke\ne] The only fence against the world is a thorough knowledge of it. John Locke\nf] Man is the helper and interpreter of nature. He can only act and understand in so far as by\nworking upon her or observing her he has come to perceive her order. Beyond this he has neither\nknowledge nor power. For there is no strength that can break the causal chain: Nature cannot be\nconquered but by obeying her. Accordingly those twin goals, human science and human power,\ncome in the end to one. To be ignorant of causes is to be frustrated in action. Francis Bacon.\n\nLastly, I would address one general admonition to all; that they consider what are the true ends of\nknowledge, and that they seek it not either for pleasure of the mind, or for contention, or for\nsuperiority to others, or for profit, or fame, or power, or any of these inferior things; but for the\nbenefit and use of Life; and that they perfect and govern it in charity. - Francis Bacon The Great\nInstauration [General Preface]\ng] Human knowledge and human power meet in one; for where the cause is not known the effect\ncannot be produced. Nature to be commanded must be obeyed; and that which in contemplation is\nas the cause is in operation as the rule. Francis Bacon Novum Organon\nh] Knowledge is the image of existence. Francis Bacon Novum Organon\ni] On a given body, to generate and superinduce a new nature or new natures is the work and aim of\nhuman power. Of a given nature to discover the form, or true specific difference, or nature-\nengendering nature, or source of emanation (for these are the terms which come nearest to a\ndescription of the thing), is the work and aim of human knowledge. Francis Bacon Novum\nOrganon\nj] True knowledge is knowledge by causes.\" Francis Bacon Novum Organon\nk] Roads to human power and to human knowledge lie close together and are nearly the same.\nFrancis Bacon Novum Organon\nl] For it was not that pure and uncorrupted natural knowledge whereby Adam gave names to the\ncreatures according to their propriety, which, gave occasion to the fall. It was the ambitious and\nproud desire of moral knowledge to judge of good and evil....which was the form and manner of the\ntemptation... For it was from lust of power that the angels fell, from lust of knowledge that man fell\"\nFrancis Bacon. The Great Instauration\n\nm] For man is but the servant and interpreter of nature: what he does and what he knows is only\nwhat he has observed of nature's order in fact or in thought; beyond this he knows nothing and can\ndo nothing. For the chain of causes cannot by any force be loosed or broken, nor can nature be\ncommanded except by being obeyed. And so those twin objects, human knowledge and human\npower, do really meet in one; and it is from ignorance of causes that operation fails. Francis Bacon\nThe Great Instauration\n\nn] The end of our foundation is the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the\nenlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible. Francis Bacon, The\nNew Atlantis\n\nB. Logos as Definition: What is \"What is?\"\n\n1] When you give a definition of 'straight line', what are you trying to define? [i.e. how can you\nstate what you are trying to define without in fact defining it?]\n\n2] What does Euclid's definition of a straight line mean?\n\n3] I have in my possession a high school geometry text that I found at the town dump. On the inside\ncover it has the name Charles P. Drew written, and then, right under the warning not to write in the\nbook is written, in a woman's handwriting, 'Hi Charlie!' with the dots over the i's in the shape of\nhearts. The textbook says the following about definitions: \"A definition uses known words to\ndescribe a new word. In geometry, some words, such as point, line, and plane, are undefined terms.\nAlthough these words are not formally defined, it is important to have general agreement about what\neach word means. A point has no dimension. It is usually represented by a small dot. A line\nextends in one dimension. It is usually represented by a straight line with two arrowheads...A\nplane extends in two dimensions. It is usually represented by a shape that looks like a tabletop...\"\nCompare these definitions to Euclid's, and this 'theory of definition' to Aristotle's. Is there a\n'modern/ancient' distinction here?\n\n4] Go back through Meno, list all the definitions of anything, and create categories of types of\ndefinitions. Use Aristotle to categorize and/or make up your own.\n\n5] Thinking of Plato and Bacon, if the ancient and modern account of knowledge is quite different,\nwhat is it that they are disagreeing about? That is what is this 'knowledge' the nature of which is in\ndispute?\n\n6.] For those familiar with Non-Euclidean geometry: For those who deny the postulates that create\nEuclidean space, there is an argument about the nature of a straight line. If we accept the postulates\nof spherical geometry (that is, not merely conceiving of geometry on a sphere, within Euclidean\nspace, but imagining that geometry on what we perceive to be a plane has the characteristics of\ngeometry on a sphere) then we will assign different properties to straight lines and their\nrelationships (e.g. the possibility of parallel lines). If we are arguing about what the properties of a\nstraight line are, what is the object about which we both are disagreeing? If we can come up with a\ndefinition of this object (it's not too hard) that applies in both realms, is that, then, necessarily the\nmost 'essential' definition?\n\n7] Why does Postulate 4 need to be stated? How is it other than the principle of identity (\"All\nangles of the same measure are of the same measure\")?\n\n8] Aristotle distinguishes between definitions based on what is better known to us, and definitions\nwhich are based on what is better known (i.e. more knowable) absolutely. Of which sort are\nEuclid's definitions?\n\n9] Aristotle claims [Posterior Analytics 90a31]: \"to know what a thing is [ti estin] is the same as\nknowing why it is [dia to estin]\". How could this apply to Euclid's definitions of mathematical\nobjects?\n\nC. The Idea of a Proof\n\n1] Smith reports \"The idea of demonstrating the truth of a proposition which had been discovered\nintuitively appears first in the teachings of Thales (c. 600 B.C.) It is probable that this pioneer knew\nand proved about six theorems, each of which would have been perfectly obvious to anyone without\nany demonstration whatever.\" Proofs are not found anywhere in antiquity, except in Greek\nintellectual life. Speculate: what would cause someone to prove something that is perfectly obvious,\nand thereby inaugurate a system in which the non-obvious could be proven, especially given that the\nentire rest of the world, for the 1000 years following Thales, were perfectly content to operate with\nempirically reliable, unproven theorems?\n\n2] Euclid's Proposition 6, proposition 14, and proposition 19 [Bk. I] and others are negative or\n'reductio ad absurdam' proofs. There is currently a school of mathematical thought [constructivism]\nthat rejects the validity of such proofs [can you guess why?] At very least, it is generally considered\nmore enlightening to prove something directly. What forces Euclid to resort to a 'reductio' proof?\n[Think about what the reduction proofs in Euclid have in common]. [Is I.48 a reductio proof in\ndisguise?]\n\n3] What are the conditions of a reasonable axiom? What constitutes a reasonable 'common notion'?\n\n4] Analysis and Synthesis:\nA] Anonymous scholium to Euclid XIII:\n\n\"Analysis, then, is the taking of what is sought as if it were agreed to be true and following through\nthe consequences from this to something genuinely agreed to be true, while synthesis is the taking\nof something admitted and going through to something we then agree to be true.\" [I took some\nliberties with translation to make this clearer to you. Apologies to Anonymous]\n\nB] Pappus of Alexandria [neo-Platonist, 4th century A.D.]:\n\"... in analysis we suppose that which is sought to be already done, and inquire what it is from\nwhich this comes about, and again what is the antecedent cause of the latter, and so on until, by\nretracing our steps, we light upon something already known or ranking as a first principle... But in\nsynthesis, proceeding in the opposite way, we suppose to be already done that which was last\nreached in analysis, and arranging in their natural order as consequents what were formerly\nantecedents and linking them one with another, we finally arrive at the construction of what was\nsought...\"\n\n\"Analysis, then, is the way from what is sought, taken as admitted by means of previous\nsynthesis...but in synthesis, going in reverse, we suppose as admitted what was the last result of the\nanalysis, and, arranging in their natural order as consequences what were formerly the antecedents,\nand connecting them with one another, we arrive at the completion of the construction of what was\nsought, and call it synthesis.\"\n\nC] Francois Viete (the true founder of Western algebra, 16th century): \"In mathematics there is a\ncertain way of seeking the truth, a way which Plato is said first to have discovered, and which was\n\ncalled 'analysis' by Theon and was defined by him as 'taking the thing sought as granted and\nproceeding by means of what follows to a truth that is uncontested'; so, on the other hand,\n'synthesis', is 'taking the thing that is granted and proceeding by means of what follow to the\nconclusion and comprehension of the thing sought\n\nD] Rene Descartes (16th century) in Objections and Replies:\n\"...the method of proof is two-fold, one being analytic, the other synthetic. Analysis shows the true\nway by which a thing was methodically discovered and derived, as it were effect from cause, so that,\nif the reader care to follow it and give sufficient attention to everything, he understands the matter\nno less perfectly and makes it as much his own as if he had himself discovered it. But it contains\nnothing to incite belief in an inattentive or hostile reader; for if the very least thing brought forward\nescapes his notice, the necessity of the conclusions is lost; and on many matters which, nevertheless,\nshould be specially noted it often scarcely touches, because they are clear to anyone who gives\nsufficient attention to them.\n\n\"Synthesis contrariwise employs an opposite procedure, one in which the search goes as it were\nfrom effect to cause (though often here the proof itself is from cause to effect to a greater extent than\nin the former case). It does indeed clearly demonstrate its conclusions, and it employs a long series\nof definitions, postulates, axioms, theorems and problems, so that if one of the conclusions that\nfollow is denied, it may at once be shown to be contained in what has gone before. Thus the reader,\nhowever hostile and obstinate, is compelled to render his assent. Yet this method is not as\nsatisfactory as the other and does not equally well content the eager learner, because it does not\nshow the way in which the matter taught was discovered.\n\n\"It was synthesis alone that the ancient Geometers employed in their writings, not because they\nwere wholly ignorant of the analytic method, but, in my opinion, because they set so high a value on\nit that they wished to keep it to themselves as an important secret.\"\n\n1] Which, of any, of Euclid's proofs are analytic?\n\n2] Is the mathematical passage in Meno analytic or synthetic?\n\n3] Rewrite Euclid II.4 as an analytic proof. [You are excused, for this exercise, from the\ngeneral prohibition against using modern mathematics or notation]\n\n5] Any valid proof demonstrates that, given certain premises, something is the case. Do some\nproofs also show how or even why something is the case? That is, do some proofs not only\ndemonstrate, but explain? (Proclus, for instance, criticizing I.23 offers an alternative construction he\nclaims proceeds in a 'more instructive manner') What are the characteristics of an explanatory proof,\nor what makes a proof more or less explanatory? Which proof in Book I do you think provides the\nmost 'insight' into its subject matter?\n\n6] Why is I.10, written as a construction problem rather than the proposition \"The line bisecting the\nangle of an equilateral triangle bisects the opposite side?\" In general, what makes him choose to\npresent a conclusion as a construction or as a theorem [Q.E.D. or Q.E.F.]?\n\n7] Work out a classification scheme for the proofs we read for this assignment.\n\n8] Think of the Elements as a work of literature. Heath says that Book I has three parts. Until\nProposition 27, it is a book about triangles. Propositions 27-31 are about parallel lines. The rest of\nthe book is about parallelograms and their relationship to triangles. What is the 'story line' of this\nbook? C.I. presentation: choose one proposition to present in class, and tell how it fits into the\nstory that Book I tells.\n\n9] Proposition 27, which shows that two lines intersected by a transverse line, making equal\nalternate angles with the transverse, will never meet. This proposition does not draw in any way on\nPostulate 5, the famously misnomered 'parallel postulate'. We all know that alternate geometries\ncan be formulated in which either [a] all lines meet, or in which [b] a number of lines drawn through\nany point are parallel to a third line ([b] is not ruled out in Euclid until Proposition 29, which does\ncite postulate 5). So what is it that has created 'Euclidean space' in the Elements, prior to I.27, if\nnot the 'parallel postulate'?\n\nII. Logos and Arithmos\n\nA. Logos as Ratio\n\n1] In the definitions in Book V and Book VII of Euclid's Elements, why is number defined but\nmagnitude not?\n\n2] Why do you think that for number, both part and parts are defined, in magnitude only 'part'?\n\n3] Book V. defines a ratio between magnitudes, but Book VII has no definition of ratio between\narithmoi. Why?\n\n4] Describing what a proportion is for magnitudes is a much more complicated affair than\ndescribing proportions for arithmoi. What does the definition of proportion for magnitudes mean,\nand why can it not be as simple as the definition of proportion for arithmoi?\n\n5] Why does Euclid represent numbers with lines instead of points, as his Pythagorean\npredecessors do? What is the difference in the 'symbolic capacity' of the two means of\nrepresentation?\n\n6] Why do you think Diophantus precedes his known numbers (rather than his variables) with the\nsymbol >M= (an abbreviation of >monad=)?\n\n7] Consider Euclid VII 37. \"If a number be measured by a certain number, the number measured\nwill have a part having the same name as the measuring number.\" What does this mean? What\ndoes it say about how Euclid considers fractions in relationship to the concept 'arithmos'?\n\n8) Given the Greek understanding of fractions, why do you think they were only written as strings\nof unit fractions?\n\n9) One reason why 1 and 2 are not considered numbers by the Pythagoreans derives from their\nconception of a number as the sum of other numbers. In this conception, 1 and 2 can only be\ngenerators of number, not numbers themselves. The Pythagorean shape numbers in Nicomachus\nare a particular version of this conception of numbers as sums - in this case a number is a\nsummation series. Why do you think the Pythagoreans might have thought that this quality of\nbeing a sum was definitive to the concept 'number'?\n\nB. Magnitude and Multitude\n\n1] It is said that the Pythagoreans were the first to consider geometry and arithmetike (number theory) as\none subject, which they called mathematike or 'learnable'. It was not until Aristotle that the term\nseemed to gain general usage as meaning specifically these kinds of study (including then the rest of the\nclassic quadrivium, music and astronomy). It seems significant, and perhaps necessary, that in creating\nthe axio-deductive system of theoretical geometry, the Pythagoreans convert geometry from a science of\nmeasurement to a science (perhaps) of shapes. In doing so they banish all numbering from geometry and\ncreate a disjunct between number and magnitude. Given this, why do you think the Pythagoreans thought\nthat these subjects should be grouped together under one label?\n\n2] Compare the definitions in Bk. V and Bk. VII of Euclid. Note the differences and explain them (most\nimportant, contrast and compare Def. V.5, 6 and Def. VII. 20).\n\n3] Many of the propositions in Bk. V and Bk. VII are identical. Make note of anything that occurs in one\nbook but not the other, and speculate on the cause or meaning of such distinctions.\n\n4] What distinctions could one draw between magnitude and multitude if one considered only Euclid\nBks. V. and VII?\n\n5] Thinking about Aristotle's division of the genus 'quantity', and the Greek conception of arithmos,\nwhy do you think that magnitude and multitude are treated as entirely distinct subjects?\n\n6] Euclid's Book VII takes four definitions to cover the same issues for magnitude that Book V.\ncovers in one definition for multitude. What do you think this says about either the relative\ncomplexity of the two concepts, or their relative 'intuitiveness'?\n\n7] Does the fact that most of the definitions about proportion come in the book on magnitude\nindicate that magnitude is the genus, of which multitude is a species (given that all of these\ndefinitions apply also to arithmoi)? Consult Aristotle on this.\n\n8] In the definitions of Book VII there is an elaborate system for classifying arithmoi. Why is there\nnot a similarly elaborate system of classification for magnitudes? (in our section on irrationals, you\nmight consider whether or not Book X performs this function for magnitudes).\n\nC. Quality and Quantity\n\n1] The first sentence in Ch. 6 of Aristotle's Categories divides quantity into the sub-categories\n'discrete' and 'continuous'. This is the first thing that Aristotle has to say about quantity, thus one\nassumes that it is the most fundamental, if not most important statement one can make about\nquantity. If this is the beginning of a definition, what kind of definition is it?\n\n2] These are the primary species of the genus 'quantity'. Why? Can you think of any other ways to\nsubdivide the idea of 'quantity'?\n\n3] The division of relative position vs. no relative position is the second way that Aristotle divides\nthe genus quantity. The division does not coincide with the first division. Does it seem as\nimportant to you? As 'natural'?\n\n4] Again, in Ch. 6, Aristotle says \"That which is not a quantity can by no means, it would seem, be\ntermed equal or unequal to anything else\" Does this constitute a definition of quantity: if not an\nessential one, at least exclusive?\n\n5] The Pythagoreans supposedly began the tradition that considered the four mathematical sciences\n(arithmetike, geometry, music, astronomy) to be related as parts of a greater science of 'quantity'.\nDoes Aristotle's discussion of quantity support this contention?\n\n6] The word 'Arithmos' does not cover the same ground as 'number.' We have a few phrases that\ncome close to expressing what 'arithmos' expresses: counting numbers, positive integers, natural\nnumbers. The Greeks did not have a word that covers exactly the same ground that our word\nnumber covers. Does 'poson'[quantity, 'how much'] perform that function?\n\nD. The Greek Conception of Number\n\n1] Consider the following definitions of number/arithmos and answer these questions:\na] Which best defines a number? Defend your answer (you do not have to confine yourself to\ndefinitions where that term, rather than arithmos, is used)\nb] Which best defines arithmos? Defend your answer. (you do not have to confine yourself to\ndefinitions where that term, rather than 'number', is used)\nc] Based on your answer to [a] and [b], what is the essential difference between 'number' and\n'arithmos'?\n\n1] Thales: \"arithmos is a collection of units\" [Iamblichus Introductio Arithmetica p. 10]\n2] Pythagoreans - \"made number out of one\" 985a20.\n3] Chryssipus \"multitude one\"\n4] Moderatus [neo-Pythagorean, 60 a.d.] arithmos \"a progression of multitude beginning from a unit\nand a regression ending in it.\" Stobaeus; Eclogae i. Proem. 8\n5] Nicomachus \"a flow of quantity made up of units\"\n6]: \"Number is that by which the quantity of each thing is revealed.\" Simon Stevin\n7] \"An arithmos is a finite multitude...\" Eudoxus\n8] \"limited multitude\". Aristotle, Metaphysics 1020a 30\n9] \"a set/system of units\" Domninus 413\n10] \"arithmos is always a multitude of indivisibles\" Aristotle; Metaphysics\n1085b22\n11] \"an aggregate in the realm of quantity composed of monads\" Nicomachus. 13, 8\n12] Aristotle \"an arithmos signifies a measured plurality or a plurality of measures\" [Metaphysics\n1088a6]\n13] Aristotle gives a few implied definitions of arithmos, but here are some passages from his\nwritings that employ arithmos in a way that gives a deeper sense of what he means by the term:\n\nMetaphysics Delta 13, 1020a8-14:\nQuantity [poson, literally \"how much\" or \"how many\"] is said to be that which is divisible\ninto constituents, each of which is by nature one [or \"a one\"] and a \"this\" [tode ti, a specific\nindicable thing]. A plurality [plethos] is a kind of quantity if it [the quantity] is numerable\n[countable; arithmeton]; a magnitude is a kind if quantity if it [the quantity] is measurable. A\n\nplurality is said to be that which is divisible potentially into parts which are not continuous; a\nmagnitude, on the other hand, is that which is potentially divisible into parts which are\ncontinuous....Of these, a limited [peperasmenon] plurality is said to be a arithmos, a limited\nlength a line, a limited width a surface, and a limited depth, a body.\n\nMetaphysics Iota (I)6, 1057a2-6:\nPlurality is as if it were [or \"such as\"; hoion] a genus of arithmos; for arithmos is a plurality\nmeasurable by the one. And in some sense [or \"in a way\"] the one and arithmos [or \"a\narithmos\"] are opposed, not as contraries, but...as some relative things are; for the one in so\nfar as it is a measure is opposed to arithmos in so far as arithmos is measurable.\n\nMetaphysics Nu (N)1, 1087b33-1088a15:\nThe one signifies a measure, evidently. And in each case there is some different underlying\nsubject [hupokeimenon, thing laid down], such as in the musical scale a quarter-tone; in\nmagnitude a finger or a foot or some other such thing; and in rhythm a beat or a\nsyllable....And this is also according to formula [or \"definition\" or \"account\": logos]; for the\none signifies a measure of some plurality and the arithmos signifies a measured plurality [a\nplurality that has been measured] and a plurality of measures. Therefore it is also with good\nreason that the one is not a arithmos; for neither is a measure measures, but a measure is a\nprinciple [or \"source\", arche], and so is the one.\n\n2] Based on Nicomachus' treatment of arithmetike, speculate on why the Greeks did not consider [a]\nfractions, [b] negative numbers, or [c] irrational numbers to be arithmoi, or group all these with\narithmoi under as one category, similar to our concept of 'number'.\n\n3] Do the terms 'arithmos' and 'number' connote the same 'category of understanding', and is the\nargument between ancients and moderns then an argument over the proper definition and extent of\nthat category?\n\n4] Consider the following definitions of numerical unit. Why do you think that, from the Greeks\nthrough at least the Middle Ages, 'one' was held to not be a number?\n1] Pythagoreans: \"one is not a number since a measure is not the thing measured\" 1088a7\n2] Thymarides: [Pythagorean 4th b.c.e.] unit as a \"limiting quantity\" Iamblichus [11-12]\n3] \"an unitie is no number but the beginning and original of number.\" Baker 1568\n4] \"..Ramus, and such that have written since his time, affirme not only that an unite or one, is a\nnumber, but also that eury fraction or parte of an vnite, is a number...\" Hylles 1592\n5] \"...unity alone out of all number, when it multiplies itself, produces nothing greater than\nitself...Unity, therefore, is non-dimensional and elementary.\" Nicomachus [238]\n6] \"[a] if from a number there is subtracted no number, the given number remains [b] if from 3\nwe take 1, 3 does not remain [c] therefore one is not 'no number.' Simon Stevin\n7] Rabbi Ben Ezra Sefer ha-Echad (Book on Unity) (1140) first to entertain idea that one is a\nnumber\n\n8] \"Multiplicity is the genus of arithmos. Because of this arithmos and one are opposites.\"\nIamblichus [see also Aristotle Metaphysics 1056b 19ff]\n9] \"The one is the source of number\" Metaphysics 1052b22ff.\n10] \"...unity is not an arithmos for neither is a measure measures, but a measure is a principle,\nand so is unity.\" Aristotle, Metaphysics 1088a7\n\n5] Is there any notable disagreement among the above definitions of unity?\n\n6] Think back to Aristotle's claim that a definition should aim at the 'ti esti' of something - the\nessence, or literally, the 'what is it'. What would you, or any modern, say the 'ti esti' is of 3125 as\nopposed, say to the 'ti esti' of 6385)? What would Nicomachus say?\n\n7] For Nicomachus what does it mean to 'know' a number?\n\n8] One reason why 1 and 2 are not considered numbers by the Pythagoreans derives from their\nconception of a number as the sum of other numbers. In this conception, 1 and 2 can only be\ngenerators of number, not numbers themselves. The Pythagorean shape numbers in Nicomachus are\na particular version of this conception of numbers as sums - in this case a number is a summation\nseries. Why do you think the Pythagoreans might have thought that this quality of being a sum was\ndefinitive to the concept 'number'?\n\nALTERNATE ARITHMOS QUESTIONS:\n\n1] From all of the evidence of the material, come up with a definition of arithmos that does not refer\nto what in particular is included or excluded (e.g. fractions, 'irrational numbers', one, etc.). It might\nhelp you to think (or to frame your answer) with the question of what distinguishes arithmos from\nour concept of number (but again, we are looking for the concept - the container - not the content of\nthat container. There is something about the 'containers' arithmos and 'number' that justifies what\nthey include and exclude - what is it?)\n\n2] Beginning by thinking about the difference in the notions of proportion and ratio in Books V and\nVII, speculate on what the essential difference is for the Greeks between magnitude and multitude,\nand why it was so important for them to consider these essentially different kinds of entities. (Does\nAristotle's distinction between quantity and quality help at all?)\n\n3] The Greeks have left us no rationale for why they only considered what we call positive integers\nto be arithmoi. To put it simply, this is because they did not have to contend with anyone arguing\nthe case for some category called 'number' which includes everything that we put in there. Try to\ntease out of this week's readings any clues as to why the Greeks would be so unified in maintaining\n\nsuch a limited concept. (the answer to this will be implicated in the answer to #1, and you can\ncombine the two answers if you'd like).\n\nIII. Measuring the Unmeasurable: Putting the Irrational in Ratio\n\n1] In Topics 158b29 Aristotle states that when a line parallel to the base cuts a triangle, it divides\nthe sides and the areas similarly, \"...for the areas and the straight lines have the same antanairesis,\nand this is the definition of 'the same ratio'.\" The process of antanairesis (called by Euclid\nanthuphairesis) is the process used to find the Greatest Common Divisor in Book X.1. How does\nthis process 'define' a ratio? How does this definition compare with the definitions of ratio in Book\nV.\n\n2] How do you think the Greeks came to suspect that two lines could have no common measure\n(hint: think 'Pythagorean')?\n\n3] Thinking about the 'Pythagorean' proof of the incommensurability of the diagonal and the side of\nthe square (or, as we might put it, of the √2), Can you use the same method to prove that √3 and √5\nare irrational? Why doesn't this kind of proof demonstrate that √4 is irrational (answer is not\n'because it isn't)?\n\n4] Given that the Greeks often substituted for the word 'arithmos' the phrase 'the odd and the even',\nas if these mean the same thing, what might be the significance of proving that any ratio of integers\nexpressing the relationship of the side to the diagonal would have to be both even?\n\n5] In Euclid, Book. V: What is it about magnitudes that are commensurable in square that makes\nthem 'expressible' in terms of each other? Why does this not hold, for instance, for magnitudes\ncommensurable in cube?\n\n6] Proposition X.2 is never used by Euclid to discover or prove incommensurability. In fact, it is\nused incidentally in Proposition X.3, but then never again employed by Euclid. What then is the\nfunction of this Proposition? Is it a kind of definition of incommensurability? If so, is it an\nessential (ti esti) definition, or a definition by way of identifying a necessary attribute of\nincommensurables (that is, a definition by exclusion)?\n\n7] How could Proposition XIII.5 be converted into a proof of the incommensurability of the\nsegments of the 'golden ratio.'(Hint: start performing an anthuphairesis between the final, larger\nline and its larger segment)\n\n8] When we reverse the anthuphairetic proof of the incommensurability of the side and diagonal of\nthe square, the ratios of the sides and diagonals seem to approach the √2. Can you prove that this\nprogression of ratios is approaching the true value of the side/diagonal ratio (and can you do so in a\n\"Greek\", i.e. geometric manner)?\n\n9] 'Why' does reversing the anthuphairesis give us this approximating progression?\n\n10] The 'common measure' of the side and diagonal, if it exists in any fashion, seems to be an\nentity of which we can always say, with great precision, whether it is greater or less than any\nparticular arithmos, but can never say with precision what exactly it is. Thinking back to Aristotle's\ncategories in Chapter 2, have we grasped this entity as a 'quantity' or as a 'relation', or what?\n\n11] The pattern generated by those incommensurable magnitudes that can be proven\nincommensurable through anthuphairesis is palindromic. Can you see why this is so, given that the\nreverse of the anthuphairesis proving them to be incommensurable, always yields a series of ratios\nsuccessively approximating the ratio of the two incommensurable?\n\n12] In Book X, are the medial, apotome, and the binonomial in any way 'essentially' different?\n\nIV. Fitting Ideas to the World\n\nA. Courage in Laches\n\n1] What are the 'two sides' of the debate over the nature of courage? Are there more than one set of\nopposites contending for the definition of courage?\n\n2] Is progress made in this dialogue? Are the two sides brought closer together? Although the\ndialogue ends in failure, do we have a better sense of what courage is at the end then we do at the\nbeginning? If there is progress, exactly how does it happen (e.g., do the two sides inch closer, does\none side best the other, some of both - be as 'methodical' as possible in laying this out).\n\nB. Justice in The Republic\n\n1] Are there two sides contending for the name of Justice in Book I of the Republic? If not, then\nwhat is the 'argument structure' of the book?\n\n2] Do we know better at the end of Book I what justice is? What it isn't?\n\n3] If we do not have the same kind of 'two sided debate' as in Laches, then speculate as to why: is\njustice somehow inherently different from courage? Is Plato up to something different here. Any\ninteresting guesses (with supporting argument) are welcome.\n\nC. The Pursuit of Truth\n\n1] The word eidos appears 59 times in Euclid's Elements, and every single occurrence of the word is\nfound in either Book VI, which plays out the Eudoxian theory of proportions developed in Book V,\nor in Book X, the excruciatingly complex attempt at classifying and thus grasping the various ways\nin which magnitudes can be incommensurable.1 We should be cautious about making too much of\n\n1 Here is a typical example of Euclid's use of the word:\n\"From this it is evident that, if three straight lines are proportional, then, as the first is to the third, so is the eidos described on the first\nto that which is similar and similarly described on the second.\" [Book VI, Proposition 19, lines 34-37]. The word eidos here seems to\nmean simply shape or figure.\n\nthis strange concentration of the word eidos within two sections of Euclid. Still, the question is\nunavoidable: Why might this notion of 'eidos' be most needed in these two investigations?\n\n2] What is the relationship between the word eidos as used in Euclid, and as used in The Republic?\n\n3] If the metaphor of the cave and the discussion of the divided line are both considerations of the\nnature of an 'eidos' and the way in which we can grasp 'eide', what is the constant sense of eidos\nbetween these two passages?\n\n4] What does Plato's ordering of the education of the Guardians say about the nature of the eide?\n5] Make a list of the attributes of an eidos, gleaned from this reading\n6] Speculate, based on the following three clues, on what the relationship might be between the\nPlatonic notion of an 'eidos' and the role of the idea of 'shape' in Greek mathematics:\n\n[a] There is a close connection between Plato's conception of the eidos of something, and the\nAristotelian demand for a definition as the statement of the ti esti of something.\n\n[b] Plato chooses to use for this notion which has developed into our word 'idea' the word that\nEuclid employs for 'shape' or 'figure'.\n\n[c] In Meno, when Socrates gives an example of how to define something, he chooses the\nexample of a 'shape'. He notably avoids using the term eidos, but uses instead the word\nschema. Then, as we know, to give an example of how knowledge is acquired, he chooses the\nexample of finding a particular length by locating it as part of a structure, or shape.\n\nD. The Truth as a Surd\n1] The saying \"God is an inexpressible number\" (\n) is attributed to a\nthinker named Lysis, (c. 425 B.C.). Assuming that this refers to the work being done in\nincommensurable magnitudes at this time, what could he mean?\n\nWhy do you think that Theaetetus and Meno, Plato's two dialogues most directly about\nknowledge, both have such a central mathematical theme, specifically concerning\nincommensurables?\n\n3] If Theaetetus and Theodorus represent mathematics and Socrates represents philosophy, what\ndoes the dramatic action of this dialogue tell us about the relationship between the two disciplines?\n\n4] If the truth of anything is only approachable by a method analogous to the dyad of the great and\nsmall, what is the relationship between humans and the truth?\n\n5] Taking the suggestion of Theon of Smyrna that the method of approximating the ratio of the side\nand diagonal of the square, and the ratio we now call the 'golden ratio' (the method of\nanthuphairesis that we have examined) was known as the 'ladder of the great and the small', answer\nthe following questions after reading the quotes I have included regarding the great and small, or the\nindeterminate dyad:\n\na] What kind of existence does the indeterminate dyad have?\n\nb] If the truth of anything is only approachable by a method analogous to the dyad of the great and\nsmall, what is the relationship between humans and the truth?\nIV. THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF NUMBER\n\n1] In his Universal Arithmetick (Newton's name for algebra), Isaac Newton defines number thus:\n\"By number we understand not so much a multitude of unities, as the abstracted ratio of any\nquantity, to another quantity of the same kind, which we take for unity. And this is threeforld;\ninteger, fracted, and surd: An integer, is what is measured by unity, a fraction, that which a\nsubmultiple part of unity measures, and a surd, to which unity is incommensurable\" Is this a\nsubstantially different conception of number from that found in Nicomachus and/or Euclid?\n\n2] Is Dedekind's conception of number significantly different from that of Newton? If so, how is it\ndifferent from that found in Nicomachus and/or Euclid?\n\nαριθμοσ αρρητοσ θεοσ\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nES.113 Ancient Greek Philosophy and Mathematics\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "SUMMARY OF THE CATEGORIES\nSubstance (ουσια, ousia, essence or substance).[6] Substance is that which cannot be\npredicated of anything or be said to be in anything. Hence, this particular manor that\nparticular tree are substances. Later in the text, Aristotle calls these particulars \"primary\nsubstances\", to distinguish them from secondary substances, which are universals\nand can be predicated. Hence, Socrates is a primary substance, while man is a secondary\nsubstance. Man is predicated of Socrates, and therefore all that is predicated of man is\npredicated of Socrates.\nQuantity (ποσον poson, how much). This is the extension of an object, and may be\neither discrete or continuous. Further, its parts may or may not have relative positions to\neach other. All medieval discussions about the nature of the continuum, of the infinite\nand the infinitely divisible, are a long footnote to this text. It is of great importance in the\ndevelopment of mathematical ideas in the medieval and late Scholastic period. Examples:\ntwo cubits long, number, space, (length of) time.\nQuality (ποιον poion, of what kind or quality). This determination characterizes the\nnature of an object. Examples: white, black, grammatical, hot, sweet, curved, straight.\nRelative or Relation (προς τι pros ti, toward something). This is the way one object may\nbe related to another. Examples: double, half, large, master, knowledge.\nWhere or Place (που pou, where). Position in relation to the surrounding environment.\nExamples: in a marketplace, in the Lyceum.\nWhen or Time (ποτε pote, when). Position in relation to the course of events. Examples:\nyesterday, last year.\nBeing-in-a-position, posture, attitude (κεισθαι keisthai, to lie). The examples Aristotle\ngives indicate that he meant a condition of rest resulting from an action: 'Lying', 'sitting',\n'standing'. Thus position may be taken as the end point for the corresponding action. The\nterm is, however, frequently taken to mean the relative position of the parts of an object\n(usually a living object), given that the position of the parts is inseparable from the state\nof rest implied.\nHaving or state, condition (εχειν echein, to have or be). The examples Aristotle gives indicate\nthat he meant a condition of rest resulting from an affection (i.e. being acted\non): 'shod', 'armed'. The term is, however, frequently taken to mean the determination\narising from the physical accoutrements of an object: one's shoes, one's arms, etc.\nTraditionally, this category is also called a habitus (from Latin habere, to have).\nDoing or Action (ποιειν poiein, to make or do). The production of change in some other\nobject (or in the agent itself qua other).\nBeing affected or Affection (πασχειν paschein, to suffer or undergo). The reception of change\nfrom some other object (or from the affected object itself qua other). Aristotle's\nname paschein for this category has traditionally been translated into English as \"affection\"\nand \"passion\" (also \"passivity\"), easily misinterpreted to refer only or mainly to affection as\nan emotion or to emotional passion. For action he gave the example, 'to lance', 'to\ncauterize'; for affection, 'to be lanced', 'to be cauterized.' His examples make clear that\naction is to affection as the active voice is to the passive voice -- as acting is to being acted\non.\n\nAristotle: Categories\nPart 6\nQuantity is either discrete or continuous. Moreover, some quantities are such that\neach part of the whole has a relative position to the other parts: others have\nwithin them no such relation of part to part.\nInstances of discrete quantities are number and speech; of continuous, lines,\nsurfaces, solids, and, besides these, time and place.\nIn the case of the parts of a number, there is no common boundary at which\nthey join. For example: two fives make ten, but the two fives have no common\nboundary, but are separate; the parts three and seven also do not join at any\nboundary. Nor, to generalize, would it ever be possible in the case of number\nthat there should be a common boundary among the parts; they are always\nseparate. Number, therefore, is a discrete quantity.\nThe same is true of speech. That speech is a quantity is evident: for it is\nmeasured in long and short syllables. I mean here that speech which is vocal.\nMoreover, it is a discrete quantity for its parts have no common boundary. There\nis no common boundary at which the syllables join, but each is separate and\ndistinct from the rest.\nA line, on the other hand, is a continuous quantity, for it is possible to find a\ncommon boundary at which its parts join. In the case of the line, this common\nboundary is the point; in the case of the plane, it is the line: for the parts of the\n\nplane have also a common boundary. Similarly you can find a common boundary\nin the case of the parts of a solid, namely either a line or a plane.\n\nSpace and time also belong to this class of quantities. Time, past, present, and\nfuture, forms a continuous whole. Space, likewise, is a continuous quantity; for\nthe parts of a solid occupy a certain space, and these have a common boundary;\nit follows that the parts of space also, which are occupied by the parts of the\nsolid, have the same common boundary as the parts of the solid. Thus, not only\ntime, but space also, is a continuous quantity, for its parts have a common\nboundary.\n\nQuantities have no contraries. In the case of definite quantities this is obvious;\nthus, there is nothing that is the contrary of 'two cubits long' or of 'three cubits\nlong', or of a surface, or of any such quantities. A man might, indeed, argue that\n'much' was the contrary of 'little', and 'great' of 'small'. But these are not\nquantitative, but relative; things are not great or small absolutely, they are so\ncalled rather as the result of an act of comparison. For instance, a mountain is\ncalled small, a grain large, in virtue of the fact that the latter is greater than\nothers of its kind, the former less. Thus there is a reference here to an external\nstandard, for if the terms 'great' and 'small' were used absolutely, a mountain\nwould never be called small or a grain large....The terms 'two cubits long, \"three\ncubits long,' and so on indicate quantity, the terms 'great' and 'small' indicate\nrelation, for they have reference to an external standard. It is, therefore, plain\nthat these are to be classed as relative.\n\nAgain, whether we define them as quantitative or not, they have no contraries:\nfor how can there be a contrary of an attribute which is not to be apprehended in\n\nor by itself, but only by reference to something external? Again, if 'great' and\n'small' are contraries, it will come about that the same subject can admit contrary\nqualities at one and the same time, and that things will themselves be contrary to\nthemselves. For it happens at times that the same thing is both small and great.\nFor the same thing may be small in comparison with one thing, and great in\ncomparison with another, so that the same thing comes to be both small and\ngreat at one and the same time, and is of such a nature as to admit contrary\nqualities at one and the same moment. Yet it was agreed, when substance was\nbeing discussed, that nothing admits contrary qualities at one and the same\nmoment. For though substance is capable of admitting contrary qualities, yet no\none is at the same time both sick and healthy, nothing is at the same time both\nwhite and black. Nor is there anything which is qualified in contrary ways at one\nand the same time.\n\nMoreover, if these were contraries, they would themselves be contrary to\nthemselves. For if 'great' is the contrary of 'small', and the same thing is both\ngreat and small at the same time, then 'small' or 'great' is the contrary of itself.\nBut this is impossible. The term 'great', therefore, is not the contrary of the term\n'small', nor 'much' of 'little'. And even though a man should call these terms not\nrelative but quantitative, they would not have contraries.\n\nIt is in the case of space that quantity most plausibly appears to admit of a\ncontrary. For men define the term 'above' as the contrary of 'below', when it is\nthe region at the centre they mean by 'below'; and this is so, because nothing is\nfarther from the extremities of the universe than the region at the centre.\nIndeed, it seems that in defining contraries of every kind men have recourse to a\nspatial metaphor, for they say that those things are contraries which, within the\n\nsame class, are separated by the greatest possible distance.\n\nQuantity does not, it appears, admit of variation of degree. One thing cannot be\ntwo cubits long in a greater degree than another. Similarly with regard to number:\nwhat is 'three' is not more truly three than what is 'five' is five; nor is one set of\nthree more truly three than another set. Again, one period of time is not said to\nbe more truly time than another. Nor is there any other kind of quantity, of all\nthat have been mentioned, with regard to which variation of degree can be\npredicated. The category of quantity, therefore, does not admit of variation of\ndegree.\n\nThe most distinctive mark of quantity is that equality and inequality are predicated\nof it. Each of the aforesaid quantities is said to be equal or unequal. For\ninstance, one solid is said to be equal or unequal to another; number, too, and\ntime can have these terms applied to them, indeed can all those kinds of\nquantity that have been mentioned.\n\nThat which is not a quantity can by no means, it would seem, be termed\nequal or unequal to anything else. One particular disposition or one particular\nquality, such as whiteness, is by no means compared with another in terms\nof equality and inequality but rather in terms of similarity. Thus it is the\ndistinctive mark of quantity that it can be called equal and unequal.\n\nSection 2\n\nPart 7\n\nThose things are called relative, which, being either said to be of something else\nor related to something else, are explained by reference to that other thing. For\ninstance, the word 'superior' is explained by reference to something else, for it is\nsuperiority over something else that is meant. Similarly, the expression 'double'\nhas this external reference, for it is the double of something else that is\nmeant..... So it is with all other relatives that have been mentioned. Those terms,\nthen, are called relative, the nature of which is explained by reference to\nsomething else, the preposition 'of' or some other preposition being used to\nindicate the relation. Thus, one mountain is called great in comparison with\nanother; for the mountain claims this attribute by comparison with something....\nIt is possible for relatives to have contraries. Thus virtue has a contrary, vice,\nthese both being relatives; knowledge, too, has a contrary, ignorance. But this is\nnot the mark of all relatives; 'double' and 'triple' have no contrary, nor indeed has\nany such term.\n\nIt also appears that relatives can admit of variation of degree. For 'like' and\n'unlike', 'equal' and 'unequal', have the modifications 'more' and 'less' applied to\nthem, and each of these is relative in character: for the terms 'like' and\n'unequal' bear a reference to something external. Yet, again, it is not every\nrelative term that admits of variation of degree. No term such as 'double' admits\nof this modification. All relatives have correlatives: by the term 'slave' we mean\nthe slave of a master, by the term 'master', the master of a slave; by 'double',\nthe double of its hall; by 'half', the half of its double; by 'greater', greater than\nthat which is less; by 'less,' less than that which is greater.....\n\nPart 8\n\nBy 'quality' I mean that in virtue of which people are said to be such and such....\n\nA third class within this category is that of passive qualities and 'having been\naffected'. Sweetness, bitterness, sourness, are examples of this sort of quality,\ntogether with all that is akin to these; heat and cold, whiteness, and blackness\nare passive qualities. It is evident that these are qualities, for those things that\npossess them are themselves said to be such and such by reason of their\npresence. Honey is called sweet because it contains sweetness; the body is\ncalled white because it contains whiteness; and so in all other cases....\n\nFor pallor and duskiness of complexion are called qualities, inasmuch as we are\nsaid to be such and such in virtue of them, not only if they originate in natural\nconstitution, but also if they come about through long disease or sunburn, and\nare difficult to remove, or indeed remain throughout life. For in the same way we\nare said to be such and such because of these....\n\nThe fourth sort of quality is figure and the shape that belongs to a thing; and\nbesides this, straightness and curvedness and any other qualities of this type;\neach of these defines a thing as being such and such. Because it is triangular or\nquadrangular a thing is said to have a specific character, or again because it is\nstraight or curved; in fact a thing's shape in every case gives rise to a\nqualification of it.\n\nRarity and density, roughness and smoothness, seem to be terms indicating\n\nquality: yet these, it would appear, really belong to a class different from that of\nquality. For it is rather a certain relative position of the parts composing the thing\nthus qualified which, it appears, is indicated by each of these terms. A thing is\ndense, owing to the fact that its parts are closely combined with one another;\nrare, because there are interstices between the parts; smooth, because its parts\nlie, so to speak, evenly; rough, because some parts project beyond others\n\nOne quality may be the contrary of another; thus justice is the contrary of\ninjustice, whiteness of blackness, and so on. The things, also, which are said to\nbe such and such in virtue of these qualities, may be contrary the one to the\nother; for that which is unjust is contrary to that which is just, that which is white\nto that which is black. This, however, is not always the case. Red, yellow, and\nsuch colors, though qualities, have no contraries.\n\nIf one of two contraries is a quality, the other will also be a quality. This will be\nevident from particular instances, if we apply the names used to denote the other\ncategories; for instance, granted that justice is the contrary of injustice and justice\nis a quality, injustice will also be a quality: neither quantity, nor relation, nor\nplace, nor indeed any other category but that of quality, will be applicable\nproperly to injustice. So it is with all other contraries falling under the category of\nquality.\n\nQualities admit of variation of degree. Whiteness is predicated of one thing in a\ngreater or less degree than of another. This is also the case with reference to\njustice. Moreover, one and the same thing may exhibit a quality in a greater\ndegree than it did before: if a thing is white, it may become whiter.\nThough this is generally the case, there are exceptions. For if we should say that\n\njustice admitted of variation of degree, difficulties might ensue, and this is true\nwith regard to all those qualities which are dispositions. There are some, indeed,\nwho dispute the possibility of variation here. They maintain that justice and health\ncannot very well admit of variation of degree themselves, but that people vary in\nthe degree in which they possess these qualities, and that this is the case with\ngrammatical learning and all those qualities which are classed as dispositions.\nHowever that may be, it is an incontrovertible fact that the things which in virtue\nof these qualities are said to be what they are vary in the degree in which they\npossess them; for one man is said to be better versed in grammar, or more\nhealthy or just, than another, and so on.\n\nThe qualities expressed by the terms 'triangular' and 'quadrangular' do not\nappear to admit of variation of degree, nor indeed do any that have to do with\nfigure. For those things to which the definition of the triangle or circle is\napplicable are all equally triangular or circular. Those, on the other hand, to\nwhich the same definition is not applicable, cannot be said to differ from one\nanother in degree; the square is no more a circle than the rectangle, for to\nneither is the definition of the circle appropriate. In short, if the definition of the\nterm proposed is not applicable to both objects, they cannot be compared. Thus\nit is not all qualities which admit of variation of degree.\n\nWhereas none of the characteristics I have mentioned are peculiar to quality, the\nfact that likeness and unlikeness can be predicated with reference to quality only,\ngives to that category its distinctive feature. One thing is like another only with\nreference to that in virtue of which it is such and such; thus this forms the\npeculiar mark of quality.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nES.113 Ancient Greek Philosophy and Mathematics\nSpring 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
