  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nCourse Overview\n\nWelcome to Introduction to the American Political Process. This course, as the title implies, is intended to present you with an introduction to American government and the political system. This is not a history course, nor is it a class on current affairs (though both of these subjects are critical to the study of political science). Instead, we will focus on currents of thought among social scientists about the workings of U.S. politics and develop a\nsystematic\nway to think about political institutions, behaviors, and traditions in the United States.\n\nRequirements and Expectations\n\nYou are expected to attend lecture and sections. You are further expected to come prepared to discuss the issues raised in the readings. Please read the assigned materials\nbefore class\non the date they are listed. Feel free to ask questions about current events, assigned readings, or lecture material during or after lecture.\n\nTo meet the purpose of the course, you will be expected to both consume and digest readings from scholarly and journalistic sources. You are also expected to be aware of current events, especially relating to American politics. I highly recommend that you subscribe to and read a national newspaper, such as the\nWall Street Journal\nor\nthe New York Times\n.\n\nLectures are an important part of the class. However, in two hours a week, I can only hope to provide you with an introduction to the material. The lectures will attempt to give you a framework for thinking about the readings. Hopefully, they will help you build a more comprehensive picture of each week's topic from the assigned texts.\n\nGrading\n\nThis is a communication intensive course. As such you are required to write at least 25 pages and participate in class discussions. Your grade will be determined as follows:\n\n20 percent participation: Regular attendance and participation in class discussion is required.\n\n20 percent weekly assignment: Each Tuesday, you will be given a short assignment to complete by the Thursday class. These assignments will help prepare you to write the three papers due during the course of the semester.\n\n45 percent papers: Over the course of the semester, you will write three 6-8 page papers. The papers are due on Lecture 7, Lecture 11, and Lecture 14. Details concerning these assignments will be handed out in class two weeks before the paper is due. The first paper will be rewritten based on comments form your TAs and turned in on Lecture 11.\n\n15 percent observation paper. During the first month or so of the course I would like you to attend the meeting of a local governmental body -- city council, school board, state legislature, or court. You are to write a paper at least five pages in length on your observations. What is the authority of the body you observed? Who is on this body and how is it organized? What issues or cases did the organization address at the meeting you attended? Who attended the meeting and who participated in the meeting? How did the deliberations go (that is, who spoke about what)? What decisions were made and how? Finally, offer observations about what you learned about decision-making within this body (even if obvious).\n\nI expect that all papers will be turned in\non time\n: no exceptions; no excuses. In addition, plagiarism is entirely unacceptable. Should you turn in a plagiarized paper, appropriate University sanctions will be pursued. If you are unclear what constitutes plagiarism, please talk to me. Finally, grades for your paper will be based on both substance and style. The papers will be graded on the quality of thought and analysis, the research you do, and the quality of writing. Use proper grammar, appropriate language and (please, please, please) proofread and spell-check the final copy of you paper before turning it in.",

      "content": "17.20: Introduction to the American Political Process\nPaper Assignment #1\nDue 11:00 AM on March 11th\nOver the last couple weeks you have spent some time investigating a piece of legislation\nunder consideration by a committee on which your Member of Congress serves.\nFor this 6 to 8 page paper I would like you describe the origins of this bill, describe its likely\nfate, and offer recommendations to your Member of Congress.\nThe first question to consider is where your legislation came from. Who proposed the bill?\nWhat interest groups and other political actors were involved in its creation?\nNext consider the bill's likely fate. Where is the bill in the legislative process? What is the\nlikelihood it will pass? You should make use of ADA scores and/or NOMINATE score as\ndiscussed in class.\nConsider not only legislative action in the House, but the Bill's possible fate in the Senate\nand on the desk of the President. Will the bill succeed in the house, but fail in the Senate?\nWill it be vetoed by the president? What sorts of bargaining do you expect? You should\nconsider the location of the relevant pivots (following Krehbiel) and the relevant veto\nplayers (following Cameron).\nSome useful questions to consider as you describe the potential fate of the bill might be:\n- Has similar legislation been considered before? Why did that legislation succeed or\nfail in the House of Representatives? Do you think the bill currently under\nconsideration will meet a similar fate as earlier legislation? Why or why not?\n- Why has this bill been introduced? Is it to create new policy? To overturn existing\nlegislation?\n- What alternatives to the bill are being considered? What amendments might be\noffered?\nFinally, put yourself in the position of an advisor to your Member of Congress. How should\ns/he vote? What amendments should s/he offer and when? In the committee? On the floor?\nWill the final bill be acceptable to your member? How should s/he vote in committee?\nWhile there are indeed correct answers to these questions, I do not expect you to be a\nprophet. Instead, I want you to make a case - based on your knowledge of the bill and the\npolicymaking processes of Congress - on what will happen to the bill and what actions your\nMember of Congress should take.\n\nSome helpful links for information concerning this paper:\n1.

      "content": "17.20: Introduction to the American Political Process\nPaper Assignment #2\nDue 11:00 AM on April 22nd\nFor the last two weeks you have been examining and constructing opinion poll questions for your\npolicy area of interest (Remember, the policy area topics for this assignment are: Gulf War,\nCampaign Finance Reform, Gay Marriage, Tax Policy, Immigration Policy).\nFor this paper I would like you to assess the public opinion poll questions you have found and\nconstruct your own detailed survey to measure opinion in your issue area. Your survey should\nconsist of 15-20 questions. This survey should be included as an appendix to your paper, but does not\ncount towards the 6-8 page-length requirement.\nIn the first part of your paper, critique the polling questions you collected in the weekly assignment\nthat was due April 1. Drawing on (and making references to) what you have learned from the\nreading and class material, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the polls as they were presented.\nWhat information was provided to help you interpret the data? What information was left out? What\nfeatures of the polls might cause you to question the findings? Compare polls conducted by different\norganizations and at different periods in time. How are the results similar? How are they different?\nHow do different question wordings give you different results?\nHaving critiqued the existing polls for your policy area, I would like you to build a better mousetrap.\nUse what you learned in class and the readings to write your own questionnaire. No question is\nperfect, so discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the question you have chosen. Think carefully\nabout response categories, question wording, and the question order. Be prepared to speak\nspecifically about what you're asking, how you're asking it, and what potential problems might arise.\nThink also about how your questions fit together.\nSome useful questions to consider as you construct and describe your opinion poll are:\n- Look for examples of good questions are you search through existing polls. How can you\nimprove upon these questions? How might you tweak these polls to measure subtle nuances\nin public opinion in your policy area of interest?\n- Why did you choose the questions you selected? Do your questions measure opinion in\nsignificantly different ways? What concerns do you address? What concerns do you ignore?\n- How does your poll improve upon those reported in the media?\n- Should you measure issue salience and opinion strength? Why or why not? How would you\nmeasure these concepts? Justify your measurement strategy.\nSome helpful links for information concerning this paper:\nHere is an excellent website that has links to several polling sources you can use to gather your\nquestions and conduct your analysis.\nhttp://www.ceip.org/files/news/library/poll.asp\n\nSome specific websites you might want to visit are:\n- The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press (http://people-press.org/)\n- The Washington Post polling site (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/politics/polls/)\n- The Polling Report (http://www.pollingreport.com/)\n- The National Election Studies (http://www.umich.edu/~nes/)"

For this 6 to 8 page paper I would like you examine the political environment\nsurrounding the bill. Describe which political interests are involved in the consideration of the bill\nand detail the patterns of political mobilization surrounding your chosen piece of legislation. Which\ninterest groups and social movements are involved in the political process? Have groups that you\nmight think would be involved in the process not become involved? What interests are at the\npolicymaking table, and which are shunted aside? What are the consequences of the types of groups\nthat are involved in the policy process for the shape of public policy?\nSome useful questions to consider as you describe the interests surrounding the bill might be:\n- Return to your first paper. Where did your legislation came from? Who proposed the\nbill? What interest groups and other political actors were involved in its creation?\n- Has similar legislation been considered before? Which interest groups supported that\nlegislation? Which groups opposed the legislation? Do you expect to see similar patterns\nof support? Why or why not?\n- Take a look at congressional hearings on your bill. Who is testifying? Are particular\ngroups being called before Congress? What kinds of information are they providing to\nthe Members of Congress? Look also at the legislative markup (if appropriate). What\nhappened in the committee?\nIf you were not happy with the bill you chose for the first paper, you may change your bill for this\nthird paper. Remember, however, that you will be taking on a great deal more work if your switch\nyou bill - you will need to learn about the background of your issue and the particulars of the\nlegislation.\nSome helpful links for information concerning this paper:\n1.
