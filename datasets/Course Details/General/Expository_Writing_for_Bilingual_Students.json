We will read and analyze samples of expository writing, do some work on vocabulary development, and concentrate on developing your ability to write clear, accurate, sophisticated prose. We will also deal with the grammar and mechanical problems you may have trouble with.\n\nRequired Materials\n\nRichek, Margaret Ann.\nWorld of Words: Vocabulary for College Students.\n5th ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999. (Do not use an earlier edition.)\n\nHacker, Diana.\nRules for Writers\n. 4th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2000.\n\nCourse Packet\n\nOne non-fiction book from those I ordered (see list at end).\n\nOne heavy folder with an interior pocket- your\nportfolio\n. Keep all written work (vocabulary and writing assignments) in this portfolio. I will review it each time I grade a paper, to gauge your progress.\n\nPaper and Revisions\n\nThere will be four major papers:\n\nPersonal essay: 10%\n\nCritical review of a non-fiction book: 10%\n\nPosition paper: 20%\n\nExplanation of a term: 10%\n\nPapers will vary in length, but you can expect to write at least\n20 pages\nduring the course of the semester, including revisions of your work. You will revise at least one of your papers, but you may choose to revise all of them-or I may direct you to. If you receive a B- or lower on a paper, I will require a revision.\n\nGrades\n\nYour grade will be based on\n\nEssays: 50%\n\nCompletion of homework: 25%\n\nParticipation in class: 25%\n\nOral Component\n\nThis is a communications intensive course. As such, we will also work on developing your oral skills as well as your written skills. There will be:\n\nStudent-led, whole-class discussions of the reading assignments\n\nStudent presentation of key vocabulary\n\nSmall-group discussions\n\nI expect you to participate actively-25% of your grade rests on this.\n\nGrades on Papers\n\nYou will revise all major assignments except the last. Your final grade for the paper will be a combination of the grade for the initial version and the grade for the revised version, with the revised version weighted more heavily.\n\nLate Papers\n\nIf you need an extension on a paper, ask me. I am reasonable. Do not disappear. Do not hide out. Papers that come in late without prior arrangement with me will be marked down.\n\nHow to Get an A\n\nCome to all classes. (More than 3 absences will affect your grade.)\n\nParticipate actively.\n\nDo all the assignments\nbefore\nyou come to class.\n\nDo your reading and written homework.\n\nWrite and rewrite your papers.\n\nSeek my help in office hours and/or use the Writing Center.\n\nWrite papers worthy of an A.\n\nThe Writing Center\n\nI strongly recommend that you use the Writing Center. Qualified staff are there to help you-but you must\nmake an appointment\nto see them. Plan ahead on this-the Center books up fast. They will give you up to one hour of one-to-one help with your assignments. Invariably, those who use the Writing Center learn more and get better grades on their papers. The instructor, who has taught 21G.222, will be on staff there this semester-ask for him if you can.\n\nPlagiarism\n\nThe phrases and sentences that we construct are our property. Using those of another person without citing the source, or copying sentences from another paper, web site, article or book violates copyright laws and is a\nvery\nserious offense in this culture.\nDo not do this\n. I will speak more about this as the course goes on, but to avoid inadvertent plagiarism,\n\nDo\nnot\nhave a native speaker \"check\" your paper.\n\nDo\nnot\nhave another international student \"check\" your paper.\n\nDo\nnot\ngo to the web to find book reviews already written about your book to \"get ideas.\"\n\nDownload and keep\nall\nsources you use for your position paper.\n\nMIT's academic honesty policy can be found at the following link:\nhttp://policies-procedures.mit.edu/academic-misconduct-and-dishonesty/\n\nTo Pass the Course and Receive CI Credit\n\nIf you are an entering freshman (class of 2006) or a sophomore, you will need to receive a C to pass the course and receive CI credit.\n\nIf you are a junior or a senior, the old rules apply-you need to receive a grade of B- or better to receive Phase I writing credit for the course.\n\nList of books\n: (To choose from for your non-fiction book review)\n\nMcBride, James.\nThe Color of Water.\nReissue edition.
