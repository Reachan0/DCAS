The subject was designed to fill a void in the education of civil engineering students,\nnamely an understanding of why major infrastructure projects are undertaken, how they are structured and evaluated,\nand how they are financed. These topics, which naturally are of central importance to civil and environmental\nengineering, are related to, but certainly not central to micro-economics, the subject that was previously required for\ncivil engineering undergrads at MIT.\nMicro-economics is an interesting and challenging field, but it tends to ignore or brush quickly over some of the central\nissues in designing and developing infrastructure projects. Where should a project be located? When should it be\nbuilt? Can it be developed in phases, so that capacity can be added only when and where it is needed? For engineers,\nplanners, and entrepreneurs, these are critical questions. Those who want to be engineers, planners or entrepreneurs\nmust learn how to balance current vs. future costs and benefits, and they must be able to understand and respond to\nthe many factors that influence the pace and location of development. In particular, they must understand the time\nvalue of money, the equivalence of cash flows, and the effects of risk and inflation on discount rates and the\nattractiveness of projects. These are all central topics in engineering economics, but they are largely or entirely absent\nfrom the standard introduction to micro-economics. As I tell my students, economics is a bit too close to the Twilight\nZone - \"a dimension neither of space nor time\".\nA second concern with micro-economics is that many of the most interesting concepts are extremely difficult to apply\nwithout making assumptions that, to an engineer or planner or entrepreneur, seem to be simplistic or heroic or merely\nuntenable. An engineer is likely to treat with suspicion any proposition that begins with \"given a cost function\" or\n\"given a production function\" or \"given supply and demand curves\". Where do these functions come from? How are\nthese curves calibrated? Some economists have gone to factories and rail yards and studied the inputs and outputs\nactually required for the various possible means of production. More commonly, economists have relied on statistical\ntechniques to calibrate functions that certainly appear to be very complex to the student (or to the reader of a journal\narticle), but that in fact are a quite simple portrayal of costs or production or demand based upon analysis of what has\nhappened in the past. For many purposes, notably many kinds of policy analysis, econometric modeling and economic\ntheory provide useful insights, but when considering major projects, engineers, planners, and entrepreneurs are more\nconcerned with what can be done in the future than with what was done in the past. New technologies, new designs,\nchanges in relative costs of inputs, and many other factors will influence what will be possible or desirable to do in\nthe future. Someone, presumably the engineers and the planners, will have to figure out what can be done and convince\nothers that it should be done, tasks that require creativity and judgment as well as an understanding of complex systems\nand methodologies.\nWhile I understand the argument that undergraduates should learn the basics of their field and that they should\ndiscipline their mind through thorough rigorous examination and understanding of a complex, intellectually\nstimulating subject, my personal experience suggests that students require the stimulation of real situations to truly\nunderstand the concepts that we try to teach them. Moreover, it is possible to over-emphasize methodologies and\ntheories while doing little to encourage independent thought and initiative. Thus, in designing my class on project\nevaluation, I included case studies, open-ended problem sets, and a term project in which the students investigated\nxi\n\nprojects of their own choosing. I had students complete some exercises from an engineering economics textbook, but\nI was much more interested in how well they could apply the methodologies and ideas in analyses and interpretations\nof realistic problems.\nAt this point I should add a short note on my background. As an undergrad I studied math, but lost interest as the\ntheory deepened and the potential applications receded. As a senior and then in graduate school, I shifted to studying\nwhat was just beginning to be called \"urban systems\", but eventually ended up writing a thesis on rail freight system\nreliability. For the next 35 years, I remained on the research staff at MIT, supervising many research projects that\nwere funded by the rail freight industry - an experience that forced me and my students to pay great attention to detail\nand to reality. In effect, we spent several decades working with rail researchers and field personnel to understand and\nimprove the cost functions and production functions related to various categories of rail freight. Over this period, the\nrail industry transformed itself from a nearly bankrupt, over-built and under-maintained system into a thriving, stream\nlined system with more trains, longer and heavier trains, heavier loads, and more efficient equipment and facilities.\nThe industry had little to spend on research, so it went to great efforts to focus that research on areas where there\nwould be a payoff. Participating in this research proved to be an outstanding way to understand the functioning of an\nextremely complex, long-lived system as it was updating its infrastructure and equipment to serve new markets.\nDuring my research career, I described much of what I did as being some sort of engineering economics. Several\naspects of engineering economics were absolutely critical:\n-\nNet present value and equivalence of cash flows: the ability to compare cash flows over long time horizons\nfor multiple alternatives, often in an attempt to understand the potential for new technologies or operating\nstrategies.\n-\nEngineering-based cost and performance functions: the ability to structure detailed cost and performance\nfunctions that captured the relevant aspects of the technologies and operations that were of interest.\n-\nProbabilistic analysis: the ability to include probabilistic features when structuring cost and service functions.\n-\nIdentification of key factors: the use of financial analysis, scenarios, and sensitivity analysis to identify the\nmost important factors affecting a project, the use of new technology, or the choice of operating or marketing\nstrategies.\n-\nApproximation: appreciation of the fact that it is seldom necessary to obtain precise results in order to reach\nsolid conclusions.\n-\nStructuring and interpreting results:\nrecognizing that lack of consensus regarding objectives, ambiguity\nrelated to costs and constraints, uncertainty about how systems really work, and many other factors make it\nunwise to accept the totally unwarranted level of precision that can be obtained from modern computational\ntechnologies.\nMy class on project evaluation was, like Caesar's Gaul, divided into main three parts. The first part provided an\noverview of project evaluation as a multi-dimensional process aimed at creating projects that meet the needs of society.\nThe second part covered discounting, net present value, financial assessment, and other basic methodologies of\nengineering economics. The third part addressed issues such as risk and uncertainty, technology scanning, public-\nprivate partnerships, and the evolution of infrastructure systems over long periods of time.\nOver time, the basic framework remained unchanged, but I was able to develop ever more detailed notes, additional\nassignments, more open-ended case studies, and more complete presentations for my undergraduate class on project\nevaluation. I also gave lectures on project evaluation in graduate courses at MIT in the Department Civil &\nEnvironmental Engineering, the Center for Transportation & Logistics, and the Engineering Systems Division. After\nretiring from my full-time appointment at MIT, I began to transform my lecture notes and other course materials into\na series of essays and case studies suitable for a textbook. At the request of Jenny Welter, an editor at John Wiley &\nSons, I expanded my notes by adding a great many simple examples, hundreds of problems, and new material on\nproject management and engineering economics. In 2011, Wiley published Toward More Sustainable Infrastructure:\nProject Evaluation for Planners and Engineers, a 500-page textbook that covers the basic methods of project\nevaluation, provides examples attuned to infrastructure systems, and includes case studies that illustrate the breadth\nxii\n\nand excitement of project evaluation as related to infrastructure systems. Solutions to the problems, an instructor's\nmanual, and power point presentations for each chapter are all available from Wiley. These materials can provide\nstudents and instructors with tools and concepts that they can use in understanding or teaching the need for projects,\nthe options that are available, and the methods for evaluating and refining the options that are available.\nHowever, a 500-page textbook is not the ideal format for presenting the concepts of project evaluation to a broader\naudience that includes grad students interested in infrastructure systems, mid-career engineers making the transition\nto management, public officials involved with infrastructure systems or anyone else with an interest in planning for,\nmanagement of, or investment in infrastructure systems. I therefore decided to return to my class notes and\nprofessional papers in order to create a shorter, more focused book that would be readily available to anyone interested\nin infrastructure systems. Instead of a textbook with long chapters and hundreds of examples and problems, this book\nfocuses on concepts and case studies directly related to project evaluation. It assumes the reader is familiar with\nsupply & demand and other basic economic concepts; it does not cover project management; and it avoids going into\nesoteric elements of engineering economics such as equivalence relationships involving gradients or geometric\nsequences. Nevertheless, most of material in this book is very similar to what is in the textbook, because both books\ndraw upon the same notes, case studies, technical papers, and presentations that I developed while teaching my class\non project evaluation between 1997 and 2009.\nThe material includes two categories of documents, namely essays and case studies. Those who wish to gain a broad\nconceptual framework for understanding project evaluation in the context of infrastructure systems can read the essays;\nthose who wish more detail on methodologies in the context of specific projects can concentrate on the case studies.\nEach essay and each case study is a stand-alone document that be read without being distracted by references to\ndefinitions or methods developed in prior or subsequent chapters. Project Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies\nshould therefore be useful to practitioners and anyone with a general interest in project evaluation or infrastructure,\neven though it may be less appealing to a professor hoping to find a multitude of simple examples and a great many\nproblems for his students to solve.\nAlthough this book does not include sample problems and problem sets, such materials can be found under \"1.011\nProject Evaluation\" as part of MIT's Open Courseware website at www.MIT.edu or directly from:\nhttp://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/75001/1-011-spring-2005/contents/index.htm?sequence=5\nThis web site provides the syllabus, reading lists, assignments, quizzes and other class materials for several different\nversions of the class. It also includes student presentations for a half dozen major projects, each of which would be\ninteresting to a general reader of this book. The URL shown above is for the 2005 version of \"Project Evaluation\",\nwhich is the most complete version on Open Courseware for the years when I alone was responsible for this subject.\nStructure of Project Evaluation Essays and Case Studies\nProject Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies is published in two stand-along volumes. The first volume provides an\noverview of project evaluation as a multi-dimensional process aimed at creating projects that meet the needs of society.\nThe essays and case studies in this volume provide a framework for understanding and evaluating projects, taking into\naccount not only the financial and economic issues, but also social and environmental factors. The essays in this\nvolume emphasize that analysis will not necessarily determine what projects are considered, what projects are\nproposed, what projects are approved or what projects are ultimately successful. Projects may be motivated by a\nvision of a greater society, by an idea for addressing a specific local problem, by the prospects of making a profit\nwhile providing a needed service, or by simple greed. Some apparently excellent projects cannot be financed, while\nit may be easy to fund some very questionable projects. Case studies in Volume I are mostly based upon actual\ninfrastructure projects.\nVolume II examines the equivalence relationships that can be used to compare cash flows or economic costs and\nbenefits over the life of a project. It covers the concepts and methodologies that can be used by investors, bankers,\nxiii\n\nand entrepreneurs in deciding whether or not to finance projects, and it shows how public policy can use taxes and\nother regulations to encourage projects that have public benefits. Most of the case studies in Volume II present\nhypothetical situations that illustrate how various methodologies can be used in project evaluation.\nCarl D. Martland\nSenior Research Associate and Lecturer (Retired)\nDepartment of Civil & Environmental Engineering\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nOctober 2016\nProtesting Extension of HVDC Lines\nHigh Voltage DC Transmission Lines in Quebec\nAcross New Hampshire\nThe Province of Quebec has invested heavily in hydropower that Hydro Quebec, a crown corporation, transmits\nelectricity to New England and New York via steel lattice towers that are typically 90 feet tall or taller. Northern\nPass, a proposal to construct nearly 200 miles of such lines across New Hampshire, is strongly resisted by\nconservation groups and the public, who would prefer the line to be buried in order to avoid destroying the natural\nbeauty that is beloved by residents, attracts tourists, and lures retirees and second home owners to the North\nCountry.\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\"Focus first on those aspects of infrastructure that provide essential services, that is, those involving\ndrinking water, wastewater, transportation, energy, and communications. ... Business and population\ngrowth have already outpaced the capacity of existing systems. To meet user's expectations, planners\nshould first determine the public's expectations with respect to the levels and resiliency of such\nservices and the amount of money that should be spent to maintain them and then determine what\nalternatives exist and what actions need to be taken to meet those expectations.\"1\nToward More Sustainable Infrastructure: Better Projects and Better Programs\nModern societies depend upon vast infrastructure-based systems that support efficient transportation and\ncommunications, provide ample supplies of clean water and energy, and enable effective treatment and disposal of\nwastes.\nThe performance of such systems can be measured in terms of many factors, including cost, energy\nconsumption, resource requirements, capacity, service quality, safety, impacts on society, and impacts on the\nenvironment. Performance can also be measured in terms of sustainability, a broad concept that refers to the ability\nof a system to perform well over a very long period of time.\nSustainability is a particular concern for systems that rely heavily on non-renewable resources and systems that result\nin severe degradation of the environment. However, troubles in any aspect of performance can limit the sustainability\nof an infrastructure-based system. Sustainability can be enhanced by reducing costs, improving social and economic\nbenefits, restricting the use of fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources, or reducing negative social and\nenvironmental impacts.\nMany infrastructure projects and programs are aimed at improving some aspect of sustainability. Some are designed\nto ensure that the system continues to function properly. If infrastructure is inadequate or poorly managed, people\nmay suffer from congestion, high costs, pollution, economic stagnation, or environmental degradation. To limit such\nproblems, on-going investments may be required in new facilities, better materials, or new management techniques,\nalthough the nature of the infrastructure may remain about the same. Highways in 2016 may have real-time\ninformation signs, better paving materials, and synchronized traffic signals, but they still look and function much as\nhighways did 50 years ago.\nOther infrastructure projects and programs are designed to replace or upgrade systems that for some reason have\nbecome obsolete or non-sustainable. Over time, as economies develop, as societal norms change, and as certain\nresources become less available, the demands on infrastructure systems will change along with public perceptions of\ninfrastructure performance. If infrastructure systems fail to evolve, they may eventually be recognized as being too\ncostly, unsafe, disruptive to society, or overly-damaging to the natural environment. At that point, new systems are\nneeded. For example, solar power and wind power can produce electricity that otherwise would have required\nadditional power plants and more imported oil.\nIn short, infrastructure projects and programs are designed to improve some aspect of system performance. Better\nprojects and better programs will lead to more sustainable infrastructure. The problem is how to determine which\nprojects and which programs are better.\n1 One of the conclusions of Sustainable Critical Infrastructure - A Framework for Meeting 21st Century Imperatives, a report based\nupon a May 2008 workshop sponsored by the National Research Council (\"Report Urges New Framework for Planning Critical\nInfrastructure.\" Civil Engineering. June 2009. p. 20.)\n\nInfrastructure Projects and Programs\nInfrastructure projects include large-scale, multi-dimensioned, long-term investments in transportation systems,\nbuildings, water resources, communications, power generation, parks, schools, and other public services. Such\nprojects always have multiple objectives, they will often be controversial, and people with many different perspectives\nmust come together to complete the projects and make them successful. Such projects have important impacts for the\npublic at large, because they will affect the environment, our society, and our economic prosperity.\nA program\nconsists of a set of related projects, such as the Interstate Highway Program or a program designed to promote\ninvestment in wind power.\nHistorically, there have been numerous large-scale infrastructure projects and programs, some brilliant, some\nmisguided, and many of them quite interesting for planners and engineers, such as the Panama Canal and skyscrapers\nin Manhattan. Projects like these affect the way we live, they are the backbone of much of our history, and they are\nthe pathway to our future.\nThis book is about understanding where projects come from, how they are evaluated, how decisions are made to\nproceed with them, and what separates good projects from bad projects. This book spends considerable time on\nmethodology, especially the methods of engineering economics that can be used to understand how projects are\nfinanced, but it also provides real-world examples and case studies that convey some of the flavor, excitement, and\nchallenge of designing, evaluating, and implementing projects.\nFigure 1\nThe Panama Canal\nAfter decades of frustration, tens of\nthousands of deaths from tropical disease,\nbankruptcy and disgrace for the initial\nFrench Canal Company, the canal was\nfinally was completed in 1914 and remains\ntoday a critical link in global transport and\na highly profitable enterprise for Panama.\nImplementing, operating and maintaining infrastructure requires planners and engineers to work with bankers,\nentrepreneurs, politicians, community leaders and the public in order to meet society's needs more effectively.\nPlanners and engineers must learn to deal with the social, financial, and environmental issues related to infrastructure\nprojects, and these issues will become more important over time.\nEngineers are likely to start out building and\ndesigning projects, and many engineers spend their entire careers concentrating on these activities. Planners and\n\nmanagers are likely to start out working at a low level on projects and programs that were begun years ago. However,\nsomeone, somewhere, is trying to figure out what to build next, when and where to build it, and how to convince\ninvestors and governments to pay for it. Actually, there are many such people, and some of them are destined to\nbecome famous. These people may end up proposing projects, or they may simply define problems and convince\nother people to begin working on them.\nEngineers, planners and managers naturally expect to work on large-scale infrastructure projects. To succeed and to\nadvance in their professions, they will need to understand the big picture - the needs of society - in order to take the\nlead in designing, implementing or marketing new technologies or new systems. Leaders will need a broader outlook\non problems than is ordinarily conveyed in an engineering subject or a textbook on finance. They will need to\nunderstand how projects begin, how they are sold to the public, and how they become successful. They will need to\ncombine engineering or planning skills with marketing, financial, and communications skills. Anyone who grasps\nthis broader outlook will have a chance to become involved in projects and programs that are increasingly complex,\nwith more possibilities for design and implementation strategy, less certainty regarding the outcomes, and greater need\nfor imagination and leadership.\nInfrastructure is usually defined in terms of public systems, and constructing and maintaining infrastructure is an on\ngoing process and problem for local and national governments. Infrastructure refers to the physical systems that\nprovide transportation, water, buildings, and other public facilities that are needed to meet basic societal needs. These\nfacilities are needed by people regardless of their level of economic development. When infrastructure is not present\nor does not work properly, it is impossible to provide basic services such as food distribution, shelter, medical care,\nand safe drinking water. Maintaining infrastructure is a constant and expensive process that often is neglected in favor\nof more attractive political goals.\nIn practice, much of the civil infrastructure may be owned and maintained by private companies or individuals. Much\ninfrastructure was originally built by private corporations with licenses or other authorization from government;\nprivate toll roads were the norm in the United States in the early 19th century, and private expressways are being built\ntoday in many parts of the world. Many railroad systems are privately owned and operated. Large office buildings\nor apartment buildings are mostly privately owned, and they are certainly part of the basic infrastructure of a modern\ncity.\nProject evaluation may involve assessment of proposed options for creating, maintaining, rehabilitating or\ndecommissioning any kind of infrastructure, whether carried out by the public sector, the private sector or a\npublic/private partnership. Thus, building a new road, adding a lane to an existing road, or paving an existing road\ncould all be considered infrastructure projects. For administrative convenience, a large project will often be broken\ndown into multiple smaller projects. The construction of a new road may involve construction of a dozen bridges,\nthree major interchanges, extensive cut-and-fill operations to prepare the right-of-way, and eventually the actual\npaving of the road. Moreover, the road may be completed in multiple phases over a period of many years. Whether\nto consider each of these activities as a separate project, each phase as a separate project, or the entire road as a single\nproject could be debated; there will certainly be a well-defined set of contracts and sub-contracts so that all of the\ncontractors have a clear perspective on their portion of the overall project. The public, however, will likely view the\nwhole road construction as a single, multi-phased project. The distinction is usually unimportant, although there will\nbe times that a small segment of a road (or a small portion of some other project) will be proposed, hoping to gain\napproval more easily later on for an extension after \"getting your toe in the door\".\nAn infrastructure program may be established as a way to manage a series of projects or a way to simplify the design\nand approval process for multiple projects. A program may specify goals and criteria for measuring progress against\nthose goals. It may also specify what kinds of projects will qualify to be included in the program and what kinds of\nincentives will be available to qualifying projects. For example, a state may establish a program aimed at attracting\nprivate investment in housing for low-income families. The program may provide subsidies, tax relief, or other\nbenefits to projects that qualify according to the criteria specified in the legislation or regulations. A company may\nalso have infrastructure programs; retailers such as Home Depot or Wal-Mart will have plans for expanding their\n\nnetwork of stores and warehouses. A railroad may have a plan for upgrading its oldest bridges on certain high density\nlines; each bridge renewal would become a separate project as a part of the program. Cities and states may have\nprograms aimed at providing housing for the elderly or for low-income residents, and they may have programs aimed\nat improving water supplies or sewage treatment facilities. The various interest groups and political leaders who favor\nor oppose a certain type of project will fight over the structure of a program, perhaps for many years, but eventually\nthey may reach agreement about the objectives, scope, funding amounts, and funding eligibility for the program. Once\na program has been established, those prolonged fights will cease, and projects can rather quickly be identified,\napproved, and implemented. It will be desirable from time to time to review programs to ensure that the objectives\nremain valid, that the funding mechanisms are adequate and fair, and that the projects as implemented under the\nprogram actually have been achieving the program's objectives.\nInfrastructure projects and programs have several common and very interesting aspects:\n-\nInfrastructure is intended to last a very long time, so it is necessary to compare what may be very large current\nexpenses with the potential for benefits that will be gained only over a period of decades.\n-\nInfrastructure influences and perhaps defines the location and land use of cities and regions, so the location\nof infrastructure will have long-term implications for local and regional land use.\n-\nInfrastructure often involves networks of facilities that are widely dispersed, perhaps with severe\nconsequences for the environment or for the people who live where the networks are located.\n-\nInfrastructure benefits are frequently qualitative or difficult to measure, e.g. mobility, safety, air quality, or\nthe availability of clean water.\n-\nInfrastructure projects and programs will be of great concern to many different groups of people, including\ndevelopers, the public, special interest groups (some of which may be public interest groups and some of\nwhich may be supporting very narrow private interests), governments (including elected officials, regulatory\nofficials, and administrative officials), lawyers, users, abutters, construction companies, and investors.\n-\nInfrastructure is costly to build and costly to maintain.\nThe long lives expected for infrastructure cannot be achieved unless funding is available for proper management,\nincluding safe operating practices, on-going inspection and maintenance, and periodic renewal and upgrades. Without\nsuch funding, infrastructure systems will deteriorate and eventually be unable to meet the societal needs they were\ndesigned to serve. Without adequate funds for renewal and expansion, it will be impossible to meet growing needs\nfor services or to capture the benefits of new technologies.\nAdequate financing must therefore be considered an essential factor in improving the sustainability of infrastructure\nsystems, where \"sustainability\" refers to the ability of a system to function long into the future. Poorly managed\ninfrastructure systems that steadily deteriorate, become congested, or become unsafe clearly are not sustainable.\nHowever, adequate financing is but one of the major factors affecting the sustainability of infrastructure.\nLarge-scale infrastructure, even if it appears to be adequately financed, can only be sustained over long periods of\ntime if it is supported by society and the resources it requires are available at a reasonable cost. If infrastructure\nrequires excessive use of non-renewable resources, if it requires too much water or energy, or if its use results in\ndevastation of the environment, then the lack of resources, increasing costs of materials, or public outrage will force\nchanges. If construction, maintenance, and operations continually disrupt neighborhoods, cause human suffering, or\nexpose people to potentially catastrophic risks, then society will be reluctant to support further expansion of that kind\nof infrastructure.\nOver time, social norms may change, the costs of resources may vary, and new technologies may emerge. What one\ngeneration viewed as highly beneficial investments may be viewed as dubious achievements or even disasters by\nfollowing generations. Infrastructure systems must evolve along with society, and rising concerns about public safety,\npublic health, climate change, pollution, environmental decline mean that society will require more sustainable\ninfrastructure.\nWater shortages, highway fatalities, urban congestion, over-dependence upon fossil fuels, toxic\nchemicals associated with large-scale agriculture, acid rain, oil spills, and excessive amounts of solid waste are all\n\nsymptoms of problems that reflect a need for more sustainable infrastructure and a more sustainable way of life.\nChallenges such as those posed by climate change, oil depletion, collapse of fisheries, and large numbers of\nendangered species combine to make stewardship of the environment and sustainable development greater concerns\nfor society.\nAchieving more sustainable infrastructure will require thought, innovation, planning, financing, regulation, and\nleadership. There clearly is a continuing need for large investments in infrastructure, and there will be many\nopportunities for evaluating projects and programs related to all types of infrastructure. Evaluating projects and\nprograms will require methodologies for comparing current and future impacts, for considering multiple objectives,\nfor assessing both quantitative and qualitative information, and for communicating and negotiating with diverse\ngroups of people.\nEvaluating Infrastructure Projects\nThe main goal of project evaluation is to help in identifying and implementing successful projects and programs.\nFrom an overall perspective, a project is successful if:\n1. It was built, which proved that construction was feasible from engineering, financial, and social perspectives.\n2. The benefits were indeed greater than the costs.\n3. The project as built was an effective way to achieve those benefits.\n4. The project was built in an efficient and effective manner:\na.\nThere were no clearly better options.\nb. There were no significant negative externalities.\n5. Building this project did not foreclose other, even better projects.\nDifferent participants might have far narrower definitions of success. Did the engineers design a building that was\nsafe? Did the contractors get paid? Did clean water actually come to the neighborhoods? Did the mayor get re\nelected? These different perspectives must of course be considered in evaluating projects, but it is useful for students,\nconsultants, concerned citizens, honorable developers, and honest politicians to pay some attention to the overall\nissues.\nProject evaluation is a qualitative process as much as it is a quantitative one. A critical step is to create a \"story\" for\nthe project that can be used to explain why the project is needed, what it will do, what the benefits and costs will be,\nand why this is the best way to proceed. There will certainly be quantitative aspects to the process, although estimates\nof costs and benefits may be rather ill-defined and subject to debate.\nImplementing and maintaining a project over a long period of time will require:\n-\nFinancing: sufficient income to cover expenses, whether the income comes from user fees, investors,\nsubsidies, or contractual payments.\n-\nGovernment approvals: licensing and periodic inspections to ensure compliance with safety, environmental,\nand other regulatory matters.\n-\nEngineering skills: sufficient knowledge and skilled manpower to conduct the maintenance and rehabilitation\nnecessary to perform at an acceptable level of service.\n-\nResources: people and materials as required for maintenance and operations and whatever additional\nresources are needed by users (e.g. asphalt for highway maintenance plus gasoline for drivers).\n-\nPublic support (or tolerable opposition and interference).\nThe financing issue is different from the economic issue. Financing provides the cash necessary to construct, operate,\nand maintain a project. The ability of a project to be financed depends upon the availability of money - not upon the\nactual economic benefits of the projects. Economic issues concern the costs and benefits associated with a project,\n\nthe distribution of those costs and benefits, and whether the benefits are sufficient to justify the costs. Economic\nbenefits may include creation of jobs, congestion relief, reduction in accidents, or improved productivity for those\naffected by the project. Some of these benefits may be easily described in monetary terms, and some may be very\ndifficult to quantify in monetary or any other terms. They are economic benefits because they allow more efficient\nand more effective use of resources, even if the benefits do not translate directly into cash for the project or for\ninvestors.\nIt may be helpful for a project to have economic benefits in order to attract public or private financing. For example,\ngovernments may choose to subsidize transit operations, housing for low income or elderly residents, or agriculture.\nThe cash provided by those subsidies can in fact attract investors, who will create commuter rail services, apartment\nbuildings, and more productive farms. Whether or not these projects are really worth the subsidies that they receive\nis important for legislative bodies and elected officials to consider, but not necessarily something that will concern\ninvestors.\nGovernment approval will be needed for any almost any project. A building permit will be needed for constructing a\nscreen house in your back yard or for constructing a 100-story office building. Governments may establish regulations\nconcerning land use, protection of the environment, the siting and size of buildings, construction materials and\nmethods, the use of union or local labor, and many other factors that may affect the feasibility, cost, and ultimate\nsuccess or failure of the project. Whether or not government agencies approve proposals or provide the necessary\npermits may depend upon legislation, regulations, the whim of administrators, and/or feedback from the public. Large\nprojects tend to generate large criticism, so developers must always be concerned with public perceptions of their\nprojects and they must be aware of ways to make their projects more attractive to the public.\nPeople with the necessary skills are needed in designing projects, in constructing them, and in ensuring they continue\nto function. It is one thing to build a road. It is another thing to enforce weight limits to ensure that overloaded trucks\ndo not destroy the pavement within a few years, to enforce speed limits so as to promote safe driving conditions, and\nto establish periodic inspections, maintenance, and rehabilitation to keep the road in safe condition.\nProjects and the people who use them or depend upon them will need resources for operations and maintenance over\nwhat may be a very long lifetime. Projects may fail because the resources needed to sustain them become too costly\nor unavailable. Some of the most pressing issues of the 21st century relate to the continued availability of fossil fuels\nfor transportation, electrical power generation and home heating, and the availability of water for irrigation, household\nconsumption, and industrial use. Many projects and infrastructure choices were justified based upon usually unstated\nassumptions that unlimited supplies of cheap oil and water would always be available. Fossil fuels, however, will not\nlast forever, and prices will rise as reserves of oil, coal and natural gas are used up. With cheap oil, automobiles and\nairlines prosper; with expensive oil, transit and rail transportation become more competitive. With abundant water\nsupplies, crops can be grown in irrigated deserts, people can compete for the greenest lawns, and industries can use\nprocesses that consume vast amounts of water. Eventually, however, as population growth and other demands for\nwater increase, the supply of water is no longer sufficient for all the possible uses, so the use of water will be regulated\nand the price of water will rise. Moreover, water supplies may diminish. Regions that are heavily dependent upon\nwell water may find that their aquifers are drying up. In other regions, changes in climate may diminish the amounts\nof water that is available. Since drainage and river basins follow geographical rather than political boundaries, rival\ndemands for the use of water have and will continue to spark political battles between neighboring states and countries.\nA populous region, such as the Los Angeles metropolitan area, will seek to divert water from distant regions in order\nto support their needs, while perhaps limiting the growth and productivity of the regions from which the water is\ndiverted. Disputes over oil reserves have already sparked conflicts in the Middle East, and the potential for future\nconflict will continue as long as so much of the world's transportation, power generation, and industrial production is\nfueled by oil.\nPublic support, or at least tolerable opposition, is the final factor necessary for the long-term success of a project. The\npublic normally does not have a direct role in decisions regarding major projects, as most decisions regarding projects\nare made by elected officials, appointed officials and legislative bodies. However, the public can provide input into\n\nthe decision process, whether by participating in a process established to promote public involvement, by writing to\nnewspapers or elected officials, or by organizing groups to support or oppose projects. Public opposition can prevent\nparticular projects, it can lead to new regulations or legislation, and it can change programs and policy. In the late\n1960s and early 1970s, public opposition was the major factor in halting construction of major urban portions of the\nInterstate Highway System, including the so-called Inner Belt and the Southwest Expressway in Boston and the\nEmbarcadero in San Francisco. Public concerns over the safety of nuclear power plants had led to stringent regulation\nof the construction of such plants in the US by the 1970s; public outrage after a rather minor leakage incident at the\nThree-Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant effectively halted construction of such plants in the U.S. for decades.\nInfrastructure, Cities, and Civilization\nIt can be argued that infrastructure projects are the key to urbanization, which is perhaps the chief characteristic of\ncivilization. If people are to be able to congregate in cities, then they will need access to large amounts of clean water,\nand they will need to have some system for treating or isolating wastes. They will need to import food, building\nmaterials, and energy resources. They will need facilities and materials to support various kinds of manufacturing\nand trade. They will want to create facilities for education, sports and worship, for communications and entertainment.\nIn short, people will have to construct the infrastructure necessary to support all of the normal functioning of a densely\npopulated society.\nYour imagination, your initiative, and your indignation will determine whether we build a society where\nprogress is the servant of our needs or a society where old values and new visions are buried under\nunbridled growth. For, in your time, we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society\nand the powerful society but toward the Great Society. The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty\nfor all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, ... It is a place where the city of man serves\nnot only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger\nfor community. ...\nOur society will never be great until our cities are great. ...\nLyndon B. Johnson, President of the United States,\nexcerpts from the \"Great Society Speech\" delivered at the University of Michigan, May 22, 1964\nThe benefits of urbanization can be great for people's lifestyles and for efficient use of resources. Higher populations\ncan support a diversity of lifestyles and greater opportunities for jobs and recreations. There can be a greater frequency\nof and higher quality for social events. When people no longer have to spend all of their time eking out a living,\nwhether on a farm or in isolated rural areas, they will have sufficient time to enjoy the fruits of civilization. From a\nsystems standpoint, having large numbers of people living in a small area allows more efficient use of resources in\nconstructing and operating transportation networks, creating housing, supplying water and treating waste. As\nactivities are differentiated, complementary activities can be concentrated within special districts of the city. When\npeople are concentrated in well-situated cities with sound infrastructure, they can be protected from natural disasters,\nand it is possible to manage development so as to reduce the consequences of manmade disasters.\nOf course, as Freud pointed out in his book Civilization and Its Discontents, crowding vast numbers of people into\ncities may not be good for everyone. The more we protect ourselves from natural disasters and the more contact that\nwe are forced to have with each other, the more difficult it may be for us to live together. There is not only the loss\nof self-sufficiency that may be achievable on a farm, but there is also the possibility of extreme poverty. A city is\ndependent upon its infrastructure - and transportation or water resource systems may fail. If diseases break out,\nthousands may die, and pollution and the inability to absorb wastes may become continuous drains on health and\nhappiness. As cities grow ever larger, congestion is likely to limit mobility, and it may become ever more difficult to\nlimit pollution, to provide open space and to ensure adequate housing for everyone.\n\nWhether cities evolve into safe, livable, aesthetically pleasing places or degenerate into overcrowded dens of despair\ndepends to a very great extent upon the ability of the people of those cities to undertake the projects that will enable\nthem to meet the needs of human life and challenges of urban life. Anticipating and responding to challenges is the\ndriving force for successful civil and environmental projects. And there will always be new challenges.\nTomorrow's challenges may be quite different from yesterday's, but there will always be basic needs to be met and\nthere will always be a need for evaluating and choosing the best ways to meet those needs. Even with tremendous\nadvances in communications and computers, with automated factories and computer-controlled highway networks,\nwith cheap transportation for freight, a global economy, and ever-improving medical care, there will still be plenty to\ndo. After all, only about half of the world's population has access to clean running water; hundreds of thousands of\npeople die each year in transportation accidents; earthquakes and other natural disasters cause thousands of fatalities;\nbillions of people live in substandard housing; and nearly everyone who lives in a large city spends a large portion of\ntheir life stuck in traffic and breathing bad air.\nWhere Do Projects Come From?\nA project begins long before the groundbreaking, long before the first contract is signed, and long before a specific\nplan is identified and agreed upon by people with the resources and political power to make something happen. A\nproject begins with an idea, with a vision of what is wrong or what is needed or what is possible. Initial ideas quickly\nevolve into whole families of ideas and possibilities and soon different, competing options begin to emerge. Long\nbefore the time for computer analysis and project planning, strong-minded, imaginative, entrepreneurial, and political\nindividuals are vying to promote their concepts for the future. The players might include engineers, politicians,\ncharlatans, financiers, developers, or dreamers. There are no bounds to how they might think or talk about the project,\nor how they conceive the project fitting in to what is already in place or what could be put in place. Their creative\nprocesses can be slow or rapid, rational or chaotic, cooperative or acrimonious - there are no rules and there are no\nlimits to how hard people will push.\nThis undisciplined, often unmannerly process eventually leads to a specific project that will be constructed to finely\ndrawn plans with a well-defined scheme for paying for it all.\nAt this point, and not before this point, project\nmanagement skills are needed, and there will be plenty of work for those with specialized software, algorithms, and\nrisk management techniques that can lead to more efficient designs and timely completion of the project. But those\nskills are not much use in the early stages of project design and evaluation.\nIt is these early stages where there is the greatest uncertainty, the most excitement, the widest opportunities for\negregious errors, and the best chances for achieving elegance in a project. It is difficult to teach how to conduct this\nprocess for which there are no rules and few guideposts. By the time that the processes are well-enough defined to\ncreate guidebooks for planners, the damage of poorly conceived projects will be only too apparent. We built highways\nstraight through cities for decades before stopping to think seriously about the effects on the neighborhoods and the\npossibility for justifying less disruptive, more effective approaches. We need to think before we leap, we need to\nappreciate the creative, political, and entrepreneurial efforts that are needed, and we need to avoid the pitfalls that can\ncatch the unwary.\nA Framework for Project Evaluation\nProject evaluation can be broadly conceived to include five phases that cover the entire life-cycle of a project:\n1. Project identification\n2. Analysis of alternatives\n3. Assessing and comparing alternatives\n4. Implementation\n5. On-going evaluation\n\nThe first three phases may require many iterations before a final project is approved, and the final phase should\ncontinue over the entire life of a project.\nProject Identification. The first phase is the least well-defined and yet the most important for the ultimate success\nof a project or a program. Many ideas for projects arise in response to perceived problems and the needs of society.\nCongestion leads to ideas for new roads or new transit systems. Rising populations require new schools, housing, and\ndrinking water. If problems and needs are understood, and if there is a process for examining possible ways to deal\nwith them, then it should be possible to develop effective projects and programs that result in a better society.\nHowever, there will not necessarily be any process for determining and responding to societal needs. The ideas for\nmany projects may originate when someone senses an opportunity to make some money or to create some sort of\nmonument. Ideas for projects might well come from someone - an entrepreneur, a company or a public official - who\nspots an opportunity for using a new technology, for developing a particular plot of land or for expanding an existing\nnetwork of facilities.\nIt may well happen that project proponents first identify the project and then address the\nproblems or needs that would be addressed by this project.\nNevertheless, it is useful to have a framework in which the first step examines problems or needs. For an\ninfrastructure-based system, problems are likely to relate to cost, capacity, service quality, or safety. A problem may\nexist if some aspect of performance is believed to restrict the efficiency or effectiveness of the system. System\noperators will likely be aware of ways to improve performance, based upon their own insight into operations or based\nupon comparisons with similar systems in other locations. A need for better performance may be evident from user\ncomplaints, media reports, or scientific studies. Needs may be expressed in terms that are much different than the\nterms used to define problems. For example, transportation needs might be expressed in terms of mobility and\naccessibility, whereas transportation problems might be expressed in terms of travel delays and maintenance costs.\nThe objectives of the project need to be clear and well defined, but they can be modified based upon feedback and\nassessments concerning completed projects or new information related to needs and opportunities. The need for\nflexibility may lead to certain challenges in the overall decision-making and implementation process. Sometimes\nstrategic objectives are too narrowly defined and remain fixed despite changing conditions and acquisition of new\ninformation. Sometimes objectives are in conflict with objectives of other programs, particularly in the public sector,\nso that projects can only be developed after due consideration of related programs.\nThe next step is to generate alternatives for addressing the problems and needs that have been identified. Problems\nand needs should be considered in general terms, so that different kinds of alternatives can be considered. For example,\nmany systems must deal with potential capacity problems related to growth in population. If so, then alternatives\ncould not only consider expanding capacity to keep pace with population growth, but also consider increasing prices\nin order to limit demand or increasing efficiency of operations in order to allow more effective use of existing capacity.\nThe project identification phase concludes with a clear statement of needs, a set of objectives and specific assessment\ncriteria, and an initial list of alternatives for achieving the objectives. Key results from this stage of project evaluation\ninclude clear statements of needs and objectives, the establishment of criteria, and the selection of alternatives for\nfurther study.\nAnalysis of Alternatives. The process then enters the analysis phase, in which studies provide information that will\nhelp in assessing and comparing the various alternatives that are being evaluated. Various studies will be necessary\nto assess the viability of each alternative with respect to technical, financial, operational, social, economic,\nenvironmental or other objectives. Considerable discussion and thought will be devoted to identifying performance\nmeasures and evaluation criteria for each major objective. Preliminary studies may give an early indication of the\nviability of an alternative, along with the risk involved. The most promising alternatives will be studied in greater\ndepth. Analysis may include market demand studies, cost-benefit analysis, environmental impact assessment, and\nsocial assessment. Very detailed analyses involving multiple groups of people with backgrounds in engineering,\neconomics, environmental science or other disciplines may be required. Important planning decisions during this\n\nphase of project evaluation include the allocation of resources to the different types of studies and the extent to which\nthe process allows refinement and modification of alternatives.\nAssessing and Comparing Alternatives. Assessing the results of the analysis is a separate stage from analysis,\nbecause there will be many different kinds of results to be considered. During this phase, it will be necessary to\ncompare alternatives with respect to how well they satisfy the objectives that were previously established. Assessment\nwill involve consideration of financial, economic, environmental and social factors. To what extent does each\nalternative meet the needs that are being addressed? What are the costs and benefits of each alternative? Are costs\nand benefits measured properly? To what extent does each alternative lead to positive or negative externalities, i.e. to\nbroader impacts on the environment or the community or the region that would result from implementing a particular\nalternative?\nWhereas analysis requires specialists and may include many independent studies, assessment requires generalists. For\npublic projects and for large private projects that require public approval, there will have to be opportunities for input\nfrom potential users, abutters, and the general public. Users may push for a bigger and better system. Abutters, those\nwho live next to the construction sites, may like the concept of the project, but oppose the proposed location. This\ntype of opposition is so common that it is known by an acronym - NIMBY - which means \"Not In My Back Yard.\"\nThe general public, to the extent that is informed about the issues, is likely to be more receptive to a more balanced\napproach that recognizes the potential benefits of the project while acknowledging the importance of externalities.\nThe goal at this stage is not necessarily to define the exact, best option, but to determine the general approach that is\nbest. The outcome from this stage could be one of three broad conclusions:\n-\nOne alternative clearly is the best.\n-\nFurther study is necessary to determine which alternative is best.\n-\nNone of the alternatives is worth pursuing.\nIf one alternative is clearly the best, then it is possible to proceed to the next phase. If there is no alternative that is\nclearly the best, then more detailed analysis may be needed that focus on what are believed to be the most promising\nalternatives. It may also be desirable to revise some of the alternatives or to suggest new alternatives or different kinds\nof analysis. This phase of the evaluation process requires the consideration of multiple objectives as well as risk\nassessment in order to compare what could be markedly different alternatives. It also requires some mechanism for\nensuring that there are no better alternatives that should have been studied, as well as a mechanism for determining\nthat the preferred alternative in fact is a cost-effective way of meeting the needs identified at the outset. Table 1\nsuggests some guidelines for this phase of project evaluation.\nImplementation. Project identification, analysis and assessment are iterative processes that may continue for years\nor decades without finding an alternative that is technically, financially, and politically feasible. Eventually, it may\nbe possible to agree upon a particular alternative. The fine-tuning of a particular alternative may involve mitigation\nof environmental or social impacts, it may involve modifications aimed at reducing costs or increasing benefits (a\nprocess known as value-engineering), and it may involve modifications to incorporate recommendations resulting\nfrom public input or the various studies that were conducted. At some point, detailed engineering design can be\ncompleted, and a construction management program can be initiated. A strategy for construction must be developed.\nHow soon should construction begin? How quickly should construction proceed? What are the possibilities for\nimplementing the project in stages? Once these questions have been answered, a project management team will be in\ncharge of the actual construction process, and there will be innumerable decisions related to the best construction\ntechniques, logistics, coordination of sub-contractors, communications and cooperation with relevant public\nauthorities and maintaining the safety and security of the site. Before construction is complete, it will be necessary to\nbegin the transition from to operation. Eventually the construction phase ends and the project is up and operating: the\nbridge is open, the tenants are in the building, the water is flowing, or the park is opened to the public.\n\nTable 1 Guidelines for Assessing Projects\n1.\nAddress the grand issues.\n-\nEconomic viability - is there a clear case for supporting the\nproject?\n-\nEngineering - what are the options regarding capacity, staging, and\nflexibility?\n-\nFinancial feasibility - is there a way to cover investment and\noperating costs?\n-\nEnvironmental impacts - can the project be done with less negative\nimpact on the environment? Can it result in improvements to the\nenvironment?\n-\nPolitical feasibility - who is likely to support or oppose the project?\nHow can negative social impacts be mitigated?\n-\nOrganizational structure - is the project best done as a public\nproject, a private project, or a public/private partnership?\n-\nSize - would a larger or smaller project be better than what is\nproposed?\n2.\nConsider comparable projects to get a quick, though rough estimate of the\nviability of the project.\n3.\nConsider the possibility that the benefits are so great that there is more\ndanger from doing too little than from doing too much.\n4.\nBe prepared to think at all scales: local, regional and national.\n5.\nThink about aesthetics and plan with an eye to style.\nOn-going Evaluation. Few projects are so well-planned and so carefully executed that everything goes perfectly on\nday one of the transition. There will be a period of time during which minor problems will be identified and corrected.\nAfter operations have settled down, it will be possible to compare the actual performance to what was intended. Was\nthe project completed as planned? Was it completed on time and on budget? Most importantly, how effectively has\nthe project addressed the original problems and needs? Answers to questions such as these will help in planning the\nnext project and perhaps help in creating criteria for a program for constructing many similar projects.\nIn summary, the process of defining a project can be viewed as a logical sequence of well-defined steps beginning\nwith identification of needs and concluding with on-going monitoring of performance. While it is useful to have a\nframework such as this for thinking about projects and project evaluation, it is important to recognize two fundamental\naspects of the process of defining and selecting projects.\nFirst, the process is iterative. It may begin either with identifying needs, technological opportunities, or with an idea\nfor a specific project. Once assessment begins, new ideas may emerge or people may find serious problems with all\nof the proposals, so it will be necessary to reconsider the needs and the opportunities.\nSecond, the process may not necessarily be logical or rational. Suggestions for projects may come from those who\nwant to build them or from those who want to operate them - whether or not the projects they propose are the best\nprojects or the projects that respond to the most pressing needs of society. Companies that build roads and bridges\nwant to build more roads and bridges, just as highway authorities may respond to all transportation problems by\nrecommending construction of more highways. New technologies quickly lead to ideas for new projects, but it may\nbe years or decades or longer before those projects can be justified. With many new technologies, the new capabilities\ncreate new needs, or at least perceived needs (continuous, instantaneous connections to the internet; high definition\nTV). With advertising, suppliers can create needs that drive construction of new plants and distribution facilities\n(bottled water is a good example - especially when the water is obtained directly from a region's public water supply).\nIt is a mistake to expect the process to be completely rational. On the other hand, it is also a mistake not to try to\n\nimpose a rational process on defining needs, identifying alternatives, and assessing, selecting, and modifying\nalternatives.\nEssays and Case Studies\nThis book includes a collection of essays and cases studies that address the many phases of project evaluation. The\nfirst volume provides a framework for understanding and evaluating projects, taking into account not only the financial\nand economic issues, but also social and environmental factors. Examples and case studies illustrate the complexity\nof major projects and demonstrate the role for and the limits of analysis in clarifying and resolving issues. The second\nvolume shows how to apply the basic methods of engineering economics in evaluating major infrastructure projects.\nExamples and exercises indicate how to develop and apply models for estimating the costs of resources required for\nsuch projects and how to estimate their life-cycle costs. A major goal of both volumes is to promote an approach to\nproject evaluation that is based upon an appreciation of the needs of society, the potential for sustainable development,\nand a recognition of the problems that may result from poorly conceived or poorly implemented projects and programs.\nKey concepts include the following:\n-\nJustification of large investments: how to determine whether future benefits justify current costs.\n-\nTechnology-based performance functions: creating functions with sufficient detail to explore how cost,\nservice, capacity, and safety vary with major project options related to size, design, and technology.\n-\nCost-effectiveness: how to compare options for achieving non-monetary benefits.\n-\nSustainability: environmental, financial, economic and social aspects of sustainability.\n-\nEvolution of systems: understanding how systems evolve in response to changes in needs, technologies,\nand financial capabilities.\nAnalytical methodologies can be applied to each of these concepts. However, it is critical to recognize that analysis\nwill not necessarily determine what projects are considered, what projects are proposed, which of these projects are\napproved or which projects are ultimately successful.\nProjects may be motivated by a vision of a greater society, by an idea for addressing a specific local problem, by the\nprospects of making a profit while providing a needed service, or by simple greed. Some apparently excellent projects\ncannot be financed, while it may be easy to fund some very questionable projects. Lackluster projects may prevent\noutstanding projects, and highly acclaimed projects may prevent dozens of less showy, but more effective projects.\nFinancially successful projects may be terrible in terms of their consequences for the environment, and projects sold\nas being good for the environment may turn out to be overly expensive or socially unacceptable.\nProject evaluation is not a hard science, as there are so many factors to consider, so many unknowns, and so many\ndifferent perspectives concerning what is good or bad. Nevertheless, there is a role for analysis, if only to help people\nto recognize and agree upon the likely magnitude of the most important costs and benefits. Past experience, a coherent\nframework for analysis, and a concern for sustainability will provide a sound basis for evaluating projects, whether\nyou are the developer, the consultant, the banker, the neighbor, the user, or the politician.\nThis text is published in two volumes. The first volume provides an overview of project evaluation as a multi\ndimensional process aimed at creating projects that meet the needs of society. This volume emphasizes the need to\nconsider economic, environmental and social factors along with the technological and financial matters that are crucial\nto the success of a project. It concludes with a chapter that considers the evolution of infrastructure-based systems and\nthe need for more sustainable infrastructure in the coming decades.\nThe second volume provides in-depth coverage of the engineering economic methodologies that can be used to\ncompare cash flows or economic costs and benefits over the life of a project. That volume presents the techniques\nthat are used by investors, bankers, and entrepreneurs in deciding whether or not to finance projects. It also shows\n\nhow public policy can use taxes and other regulations to encourage projects that have public benefits. Both volumes\npresent methodologies that are useful in developing and evaluating projects to deal with problems and opportunities.\nAs noted in the preface, the essays and case studies are all structured as stand-alone documents, so it is possible to\npick and choose which ones to read, and it is possible to read them in any order.\n\nBasic Economic Concepts\n\"The quality of a nation's infrastructure is a critical index of its economic vitality.\nReliable\ntransportation, clean water, and safe disposal of wastes are basic elements of a civilized society and a\nproductive economy. Their absence or failure introduces an intolerable dimension of risk and hardship\nto everyday life, and a major obstacle to growth and competitiveness.\"1\nIntroduction\nThis essay introduces various economic concepts that are useful in understanding infrastructure systems and in\nidentifying and evaluating potential projects for improving their performance. The chapter begins with a discussion\nof how equilibrium prices result from the interaction of supply and demand. If prices are high, say for office space\nor for energy, then a great deal of investment in new buildings or oil drilling or wind power is justifiable. If too many\nbuildings are built or if too much oil is available on the world market, then prices fall and investments based upon\ncontinuing high prices may well fail. The success or failure of any major project will depend in part upon the future\ninteractions between supply and demand.\nCosts, prices, and values are distinct concepts that should not be confused. The cost of providing a service or of\nmanufacturing a product depends upon such things as resource requirements, capacity requirements, and unit costs\nassociated with operations. While owners surely desire that prices be higher than costs, prices are usually determined\nby market forces that may have little or no relationship to cost. The value of a product or a service is something that\ncan only be determined by potential purchasers: if they perceive the value of a product or service to be higher than\nthe price, then they will go ahead and make the purchase. The difference between what they were willing to pay and\nwhat they actually paid is an economic benefit known as consumer surplus, which is in fact an economic benefit\neven though it does not result in any revenue to the supplier. Large infrastructure projects are often justified in part\nby increases in consumer surplus, so this is an important concept for evaluating such projects.\nFrom an economic perspective, a major goal of any project will be to increase productivity, which is defined as the\nratio of system output to system input. If productivity improves, then more output can be obtained using the same or\nfewer resources, resulting in an overall benefit for society. If a company is able to produce more without increasing\nits labor force, then it may be able to afford to pay higher wages to its employees. Companies and agencies that\nmanage infrastructure will continually be seeking ways to make more productive uses of their resources, and\nproductivity improvement motivates many infrastructure projects and programs. In most infrastructure systems, there\nare economies of scale, scope or density that allow larger, more complex systems to offer more benefits at a lower\ncost.\nLower cost would seem to be a clear benefit to society, but project evaluation must consider who will capture the\nbenefits of lower cost, the supplier or the customers? The answer to this question depends upon the extent of\ncompetition. If there are many potential suppliers, then there will be competition for customers, and prices will fall\nto marginal costs (marginal cost pricing) and customers will benefit from any productivity improvements. However,\nif a single supplier has no competition or very limited competition, then it will be able to charge prices that are well\nabove marginal costs. The threat of monopoly pricing is therefore present whenever there are strong economies of\nscale. To achieve public benefits from scale economies related to essential infrastructure, it may be necessary to have\npublic ownership or some sort of price regulation.\nThere are multiple reasons why infrastructure performance and major infrastructure projects will always be of interest\nto the public:\n1 National Council on Public Works Improvement, Fragile Foundations: a Report on America's Public Works, Final Report\nto the President and Congress, February 1988, p. 1\n\n-\nFirst, the public uses the infrastructure, and the performance of the infrastructure affects everyone's daily\nlife.\n-\nSecond, much of the public infrastructure is owned or regulated by public agencies, so that there is a direct\npublic interest in managing and investing in that infrastructure.\n-\nThird, infrastructure projects are large projects with long-lasting impacts on society and the environment,\nand the public has a justifiable interest in questioning whether these impacts are positive or negative and\nwhether the costs and benefits of a major project are equitably shared.\n-\nFourth, investment in infrastructure projects can provide a boost to the region in terms of jobs, income, and\neconomic growth through what is called the multiplier effect.\nInfrastructure needs depend in part upon the economic forces that drive regional, national, and international\ndevelopment. Where goods are produced depends in part upon where raw materials can be found, where it is most\nefficient to produce the goods, where labor and other resources are cheapest, and the cost of transportation. As\ntransportation costs decline, because of improvements in technology and expansions of transportation infrastructure,\ndistance ceases to be an impediment to consolidation of agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and other industrial\nactivities. Cheap transportation has enabled the rise of a global economy, and regions in one country now compete\nwith regions in other countries for all sorts of economic activities.\nTwo concepts that are directly relevant to\nunderstanding the global economy are spatial price equilibrium and comparative advantage. As patterns of trade\nand production shift, the needs for industrial facilities and transportation infrastructure also shift. In the less developed\nparts of the world, investments in infrastructure may be required for the economic growth. In the developed parts of\nthe world, existing infrastructure that was designed for the economy of the 19th or 20th centuries may need to be\nredeveloped or replaced by infrastructure relevant to the 21st, with greater emphasis on major ports and continental\ndistribution systems and less emphasis on access to local production facilities.\nProject evaluation requires consideration of broad economic issues such as globalization, the need for regulatory\npolicy, corporate decision-making, and the importance of regional economic impacts. However, it is also worth\nconsidering the perspective of the individuals who ultimately will be making the decisions that determine which types\nof infrastructure are used, how much revenue is gained, and whether or not infrastructure projects prove to be\nsuccessful. Individuals decide such things as how much living space they need, whether to live in the city or a suburb,\nwhether or not to water the lawn on a regular basis, whether to drive or take the bus to work, whether to switch from\noil to natural gas for home heating, and where to go on vacation. The concept of utility provides a framework that\ncan be used to understand how these decisions are made. The basic idea is that individuals are assumed to make\ndecisions that maximize their utility based upon personal constraints related to time and money.\nSupply, Demand, Equilibrium\nOverview\nSupply, demand, and equilibrium are central issues in economics. At the most basic level, both supply and demand\nare described as functions of price, and the equilibrium price is the price at which supply equals demand. The supply\nfunction shows the quantity of goods or services that will be produced for each price. Under normal circumstances,\nthe supply of goods and services would be expected to increase as the price increases. If the price is higher, then\nexisting suppliers will be willing to produce more, and new suppliers may be enticed to enter the market. The demand\nfunction shows the quantity of goods or services that will be purchased for each price. Under normal circumstances,\nthe demand will decline as the price increases. Some people may be willing to pay a high price, but more people will\nbe willing to pay when the price is lowered.\nThe interaction between supply and demand can conveniently be expressed in a chart as portrayed in Figure 1. Note\nthe convention that price is shown on the y-axis, although that is assumed to be the independent variable, while the\nvolume or quantity of supply and demand are shown on the x-axis. The point at which the supply and demand\nfunctions intersect is the equilibrium price. What is most important to understand is that this equilibrium price reflects\n\nboth supply and demand: under competitive market conditions, prices will adjust to changes in supply and demand,\nand there will be a tendency for supply to match demand.\nFigure 1 Supply, Demand Equilibrium\nPrices are determined by the interaction of supply and demand\nDemand\nSupply\n11 12\nVolume (Demand or Supply for the Given Price)\nPrice\nSupply\nDemand\nEquil. Price\nOver time, factors that affect both supply and demand are subject to change. First consider changes in supply.\nInvesting in new technologies or in more efficient production facilities or simply adopting better management\ntechniques may make it possible for suppliers to offer greater quantities for any given price. Graphically, this results\nin a shift in the supply curve to the right and leads to a new - lower - equilibrium price, as shown in Figure 2. Note\nthat the demand curve has not changed at all: with the lower prices, people are willing to buy more, which is what is\ndescribed by the demand curve.\nFigure 2 A New Supply Curve\nInvestment may allow suppliers to be more productive and\noffer lower prices, resulting in a shift in the supply curve and a lower\nequilibrium price (resulting from a movement along the demand curve)\nNew Supply\nDemand\nSupply\nVolume (Demand or Supply for the Given Price)\nPrice\nSupply\nDemand\nNew Supply\nNew Equilibrium Price\nThe demand curve may also change (Figure 3). For example, growth in population or increases in family income may\nresult in an increase in cars purchased, attendance at movie theatres, or use of air transportation. These changes appear\non the graph as an upward shift in the demand curve: at each price level, a greater quantity of goods and services is\npurchased or used.\n\nFigure 3 A New Demand Curve\nPopulation growth, advertising, higher incomes or other factors\nmay cause an increase in demand and a higher equilibrium price.\nNew Demand\nSupply\nVolume (Demand or Supply for the Given Price)\nPrice\nSupply\nDemand\nNew Demand\nEquil. Price\nIf demand increases, then prices will rise; if demand declines, then prices will fall. How much prices rise or fall will\ndepend upon the shapes of the supply and demand curves. How quickly prices rise or fall will also depend upon the\nnature of the goods and services being sold. Outside a sold-out baseball stadium, the prices that scalpers charge for\ntickets will react within minutes to changes in demand. Achieving an equilibrium in the prices of new homes is\nsomething that may take years, as evidenced by the steady decline in home prices that began in 2007 and continued\nfor several years thereafter because of what has been called \"The Great Recession.\" Adjusting transportation networks\nto changes in oil prices or new technologies is a process that takes decades - and may never reach equilibrium, because\nonly a small portion of the transportation network can ever be changed within just a few years.\nIn many circumstances, changes in demand result not in a change in price, but in poor service, congestion or long lines\nas too many people try to buy something or to use something at the same time. The time spent in line can be viewed\nas part of the price of the service that is being sold: some people will come with an intent to buy, but depart as soon\nas they see the line.\nOver time, suppliers will react to changes in demand by adjusting their levels of production. New companies may\nemerge in response to increases in demand; companies may go out of business in response to decreases in demand.\nIt is possible to spend a lot of time trying to understand the supply and demand curves, and there are some ingenious\nmethods for estimating these curves based upon past experience. However, it is important to retain some humility,\nfor we probably only know a little about how supply and demand vary within a fairly small range of prices and existing\nconditions (Figure 4). When new projects are being considered, it is possible that the quantity or quality of services\nprovided will be far different than what is currently available. Special studies can be undertaken to try to estimate the\neffects of the new projects on demand, but such studies will never be exact.\n\nFigure 4 The interaction between supply and demand may not be readily understood, especially\nif the factors affecting supply and demand have been fairly stable for a long time\n11 12\nVolume (Demand or Supply for the Given Price)\nPrice\nSupply\nDemand\nWe probably only\nknow a little about\nsupply & demand\nConsumer Surplus\nGiven the shape of the demand curve, it is clear that the equilibrium price is lower than the price that many would be\nwilling to pay. The difference between what someone is willing to pay and the equilibrium price is called consumer\nsurplus. For each individual:\n(Eq. 1)\nConsumer Surplus = (Willingness-to-pay) - (Equilibrium Price)\nConsumer surplus is greatest for those willing to pay the highest prices. For someone willing to pay only the actual\nprice and not a penny more, the consumer surplus is zero. The total consumer surplus in principle could be obtained\nby summing the surpluses for everyone using a product or service. In practice, this is infeasible, as data is collected\nand decisions are made based upon actual prices. Unless special studies are undertaken, little is known about how\nmuch more people would be willing to pay for things that they now buy or for services that they now use. For this\nreason, it is easier to focus on the changes in consumer surplus that may result from changes in equilibrium prices.\nConsider the change in supply illustrated above in Figure 2. The shift in the supply curve increased consumer surplus\nby a) lowering the price for those who previously were willing to pay a higher price and b) allowing more people to\npurchase the product. The increase in consumer surplus can be estimated just by looking at prices and volumes before\nand after the change in supply:\n(Eq. 2)\nIncrease in Consumer Surplus = V0 (P0 - P1) + 1⁄2 (V1 - V0) (P0 - P1)\nThe first term in this equation is the benefit to existing users from the reduction in price, while the second term\nrepresents the benefits gained by new users. The full decline in price is not a benefit for new users, since they were\nunwilling to pay the old price. If the relevant portion of the demand curve is assumed to be a straight line, then the\nconsumer surplus for the new users will be the area of a triangle whose base B is the difference in volume and whose\nheight H is the difference in price, and whose area is 1⁄2 BH. In effect, this assumption - sometimes called the \"rule\nof 1⁄2\" - provides a simple way to estimate the area under the demand curve without needing to estimate an equation\nfor that curve.\nNote that consumer surplus is an economic rather than a financial concept.\nPrice is a financial measure, as is\nmanufacturing cost; these are things that can be measured in dollars and cents and these are things that can and will\nbe recorded in check books and accounting systems. Consumer surplus is not related to any such accounting, but it is\nstill an important matter for evaluating the economic impact of projects. There is a public benefit resulting from\nprojects that increase consumer surplus, because people will still have the money that they otherwise would have been\n\nwilling to pay for the product or the service. They can save that money or use it to buy something else. Either way,\nthere is a benefit for the individuals and for the local economy. Thus, change in consumer surplus, though not a direct\nconcern for the private sector or for investors, is an important consideration in evaluating the public economic impacts\nof proposed infrastructure projects.\nElasticity of Demand\nIt is possible, but difficult, to obtain the detailed information needed to plot supply and demand, so a more abstract\napproach is often used. Consultants or marketing managers may use past experience in trying to answers questions\nsuch as \"How much will demand change for a given change in price?\" or \"Will total revenue go up, down, or stay the\nsame if the price is changed?\"\nThese questions can be answered by using the concept of elasticity of demand, which is a measure of how sensitive\ndemand is to changes in price. Elasticity of demand is defined as the negative of the derivative of the quantity\ndemanded Q with respect to price P.\n(Eq. 3)\nElasticity of demand = - dQ/dP\nThis measure may also be referred to as price elasticity. The minus sign in this equation is conventionally used\nbecause the quantity demanded is expected to vary inversely with the price that is charged. Elasticity of demand can\nalso be estimated by looking at the change in demand that occurs after a change in price:\n(Eq. 4)\nElasticity of demand = -((Q1-Q0)/Q0)/((P1-P0)/P0) = -((Q1-Q0)/(P1-P0))(P0/Q0)\nIn this equation, the changes in quantity and price are both normalized by dividing by their values before the price\nchange. The equation therefore can be interpreted as the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage\nchange in price.\nTo understand the importance of price elasticity, consider the two effects of a price decrease from P0 to P1 on total\nrevenue PQ. Existing customers will pay less, because the price is lowered, and there will some loss of revenue:\n(Eq. 5)\nReduced revenue from original customers = Q0 (P0-P1)\nHowever, the lower price will attract new customers, so the quantity demanded will increase from Q0 to Q1, providing\nsome additional revenue:\n(Eq. 6)\nAdditional revenue from new customers = P1 (Q1 - Q0)\nIf elasticity is greater is greater than one, then the percentage increase in Q will be greater than the percentage decrease\nin P, and the added revenue from Eq. 6 will be greater than the loss of revenue from Eq. 5. If this is the case, demand\nis said to be \"elastic\", because there is a large response to changes in price. If elasticity is less than one, then the\nopposite is true: total revenue will decrease if prices are lowered, as the added revenue from new customers will be\ninsufficient to offset the loss of revenue from existing customers. When elasticity of demand equals one, there will\nbe no change in total revenue PQ, as the effect the change in price will be exactly offset by the change in demand.\nPrice elasticity is an important factor in infrastructure systems, because these systems tend to have high fixed costs\nand low variable costs. Maximizing revenue may therefore seem to be a reasonable goal, since the greatest obstacle\nto making a profit is having enough revenue to cover the fixed costs of the system. During the early portion of the\n21st century, tremendous investments in satellite-based communications were justified in part upon the expectation\nthat creating a very high-capacity system with very low prices would lead to extraordinary increases in demand -\nwhich is exactly what happened as technological advances lowered the costs of email, cell phones, and wireless access\nto the internet.\n\nIn the short run, demand tends to be more inelastic than in the long run. For example, when the price of oil rose\ndramatically in 2007 and 2008, people initially had to pay the higher price and perhaps cut back on non-essential\ndriving. Over a period of a year or two, however, people were able to adjust in part by buying more fuel efficient cars\nand in part by figuring out how to combine errands, share rides, and use public transportation. Over a period of a\ndecade or longer, the automobile companies can develop cars that use alternative energy sources, allowing people to\ndrive more while using less oil.\nElasticity of demand is an important concept to keep in mind when evaluating infrastructure projects, because demand\nforecasts will drive decisions related to the size and therefore the cost and capacity of infrastructure. Forecasts based\nupon continuation of low prices or free access will lead to extravagant statements of infrastructure needs. Such has\nlong been the case with urban road networks: with the exception of a few toll roads, there is no charge for using\nhighways, and there should be no surprise that these roads have become so congested. Where tolls have been\nintroduced, as in London and Singapore, it has proved possible to reduce traffic volumes and thereby limit congestion\nto reasonable levels. Water supply is another area where unrealistically low prices have in many locations led to\nunnecessarily high rates of consumption; future \"needs\" for water should take into consideration the effect of more\nrational pricing on consumption.\nBased upon the concepts of equilibrium prices and demand elasticity, it is apparent that future demand for\ninfrastructure will depend to a greater or lesser extent upon the prices that are charged. If demand is elastic, then\npricing could have a dramatic effect on demand, and raising prices could be viewed as a way to reduce or avoid\ninvestments that increase infrastructure capacity. If demand is highly inelastic, then pricing will probably not be an\neffective means of limiting demand, and failure to expand capacity could lead to extremely high equilibrium prices,\nextremely poor service, or a need for regulating use or access. Elasticity of demand is therefore an important factor\nboth in pricing infrastructure services and in forecasting demand for infrastructure. The next section continues the\ndiscussion of pricing in the context of the degree of competition among suppliers.\nPricing\nThis section introduces two markedly different pricing regimes: competitive markets and monopolistic pricing. In a\ncompetitive market, there are many suppliers and many potential customers, none of whom have the power to set\nprices. Instead, as described above, prices reflect an equilibrium between supply and demand. Not all markets are\ncompetitive, and it is possible that geography, politics, or economic factors encourage the development of companies\nor agencies that have a monopoly for particular goods or services. In the absence of regulation, a monopoly can set\nprices and customers have little power. Monopolies are not necessarily evil, because there are many situations where\na single large supplier can produce goods or services at the lowest possible cost. Moreover, the danger of monopolistic\npricing can be controlled by government regulation, so that the benefits of low cost production are passed on to society\nand not simply captured as excessive profits by the owners of the monopoly.\nMarginal Cost Pricing in a Competitive Environment\nIn a competitive environment, prices will fall to marginal cost. A competitive environment is one in which many\nsuppliers all have access to the same or similar technologies, and they are serving customers who are able to purchase\ngoods or services from any of the suppliers. Under these conditions, a supplier who tries to raise prices above marginal\ncosts will have a problem: another supplier will be willing to offer a slightly lower price and thereby capture the\nbusiness. So long as the price is above the marginal cost, each sale will give the supplier some contribution to\noverhead and profit. Under perfect competition, no supplier has any pricing power, and prices are determined by\nthe cost structure, the available technologies, and the level of demand.\nMarginal cost pricing is efficient in the sense that prices reflect the actual cost of the product or the service. All of\nthose who purchase the product or service are in fact willing to pay - and do pay - the marginal cost of production.\nWhile others may desire the product or service, they are unwilling to pay enough to make it worthwhile to any of the\n\nsuppliers. Any supplier who can provide the product or service at a lower price is free to enter the market and make\na profit by selling at or somewhat less than the prevailing price.\nSituations where prices differ from marginal cost are likely to be inefficient in economic terms. If prices are too low,\nthen demand will be too high and some users will be incurring costs that they would not be willing to pay for. If prices\nare too high, then many who would have been willing to pay a reasonable amount for the service will be unable to\nafford to make a purchase.\nA major difficulty with marginal cost pricing arises in situations where marginal costs drop below average costs, as is\ncommonly the case with infrastructure systems. In such situations, marginal cost pricing will not provide sufficient\nrevenue to cover costs, and all suppliers will face bankruptcy. Technological advances and increasingly efficient\nproduction may help some suppliers stave off bankruptcy, but only the most efficient suppliers will be able to survive.\nIn these situations, some kind of government regulation or subsidies may be needed to enable suppliers to remain in\nbusiness. Regulation could take the form of limiting entry into the market or establishing prices at a level that allows\nsuppliers to make a profit. Examples of governmental actions that limit entry include the following:\n-\nIssuing taxi medallions in an attempt to limit the number of taxis to what will be efficiently utilized.\n-\nRequiring railroads to seek regulatory approval before constructing new lines.\n-\nCreating public utilities for communications or energy services.\nGenerally, when entry is limited, prices must be regulated to ensure that prices are reasonable.\nEconomies of Scale, Scope, and Density\nA competitive market requires multiple suppliers who are free to determine whether or not to enter the market based\nupon the prevailing prices. If there are many companies, and it is easy to enter and exit the market, then supply and\ndemand can quickly approach an equilibrium. However, the equilibrating process will be hampered if there are\nbarriers to entry, such as the need to make large investments in order to be able to compete. For infrastructure-based\nsystems, this is certainly an issue, as these systems by definition require substantial investments, and it will take time\nand effort to construct a competing system. Moreover, there are very likely to be economies in creating large facilities\nthat can serve multiple purposes for many different users. Having competition among a great many - or even a few\n- smaller companies may be less efficient that having a single supplier. Larger systems may have three types of\nadvantages over smaller systems: economies of scale, scope, and density.\nEconomies of scale exist when an increase in the size of the system results in reductions in cost. If C(Q) is the total\ncost of providing infrastructure adequate for usage Q, then there are economies of scale if:\n(Eq. 7)\nC(Q1 + Q2) < C(Q1) + C(Q2)\nFor transportation, water resources, electric power grids, and other network-based systems, there will often be\neconomies of scale because:\n-\nA single management team can manage a larger system using the same basic information technology.\n-\nThe same advertising can be used for a wider audience.\n-\nA larger network allows a company to provide single-company service to more customers, and direct service\nmay be cheaper than service that requires cooperation among multiple suppliers.\n-\nA larger network provides direct links between more locations, which in transportation or communication\nsystems can be a major benefit for potential customers.\n-\nConsolidated maintenance facilities can serve a wider area.\n-\nThe costs of energy and materials can be reduced because a larger company can negotiate lower prices from\nsuppliers.\n\nEconomies of scope exist when it is more efficient to use facilities for two or more types of service than it is to use\nthem for a single service. If C(Qi,Si) is the cost of serving Qi customers of type Si and C(Q1,S1,Q2,S2) is the cost of\nserving two groups of customers, then there are economies of scope if:\n(Eq. 8)\nC(Q1,S1,Q2,S2) < C(Q1,S1) + C(Q2,S2)\nA situation where there are clearly economies of scope would include highways, which serve commuters and intercity\ntravelers moving in automobiles or buses along with local trucking and intercity trucking. Another situation would\nbe a dam that is constructed for flood control that also can be used to generate electricity and support irrigation. If\nthere are potential economies of scope, then there will be advantages to society from building joint facilities.\nOn the other hand, there are situations where it does not make sense to have a single facility for multiple services.\nBecause of potential safety problems, pedestrians and cyclists are not allowed on high-speed, limited access highways.\nHigh-speed passenger trains cannot operate on tracks designed for freight trains, because high-speed trains cannot be\nsafely operated on routes with sharp curves and frequent grade crossings. Swimming is not allowed in reservoirs,\nbecause of possible public health problems.\nEconomies of density exist when average costs decline as a result of adding more volume to an existing system:\n(Eq. 9)\nC(Q1 + Q2) / (Q1 + Q2) < C(Q1)/ Q1\nIf applied to a single facility, economies of density would exist wherever scale economies exist. The distinction,\nhowever, between economies of scale and economies of density is very critical in transportation and other networks\nwhere there are many facilities and an extensive route structure. Costs in these networks relate to both the links and\nnodes of the system, and there are two major strategies for capturing more business, namely expanding the network\nor adding more volume to the existing network. In network systems, economies of scale refer to situations in which\nthe network expands in proportion to the increase in demand, whereas economies of density refer to the effects of\nadding more traffic to existing facilities.\nEven if there are no economies of scale, there could be strong economies of density. Much of the investment in\ntransportation systems has been attempting to capture economies of density, e.g. by concentrating more cars on\nexisting roads and more flights at existing airports. Most transport networks have strong economies of density up to\nthe point where added traffic causes extreme congestion.\nThe distinction between economies of scale and economies of density can also be seen in restaurants and retail sales.\nLarge retail outlets, such as Staples or Home Depot, are able to achieve lower fixed costs per unit of sales by having\nvery large efficient buildings with managers and employees who can be more specialized and also more productive\nthan they would be at smaller stores; with a larger work force, it is easier to adjust up or down for peak periods or\nslack periods. Big box retail stores therefore capture economies of density.\nFast food outlets such as McDonalds and Burger King, which have thousands of restaurants all over the country and\naround the world, are able to achieve scale economies. While they have some facilities that are larger than others,\nthey have vast numbers of similar restaurants that benefit from brand recognition, common procurement, common\ndesign, and standard management. These restaurants have lower unit costs than the individual restaurants and smaller\nchains that they compete with, and they use extensive marketing to convince us that their food is not just cheaper, but\njust as tasty. People know what to expect when they walk into one of these restaurants, and therefore people are likely\nto go to these restaurants not just when they are near home, but also when traveling or vacationing in another state or\nanother country. These companies clearly profit from scale economies.\n\nMonopoly Pricing\nWhere there are possibilities for economies of scale, scope, and density, there can be strong forces leading to supply-\nside consolidation. The motivation initially is to save costs or to expand markets, but if competition is reduced, then\nit could be that a single company achieves monopoly pricing power. If demand is inelastic, this can lead to extremely\nhigh prices, not to mention extremely high profits.\nIf there are economies related to size, a larger company can always underprice smaller companies and still make a\nprofit. Hence, they can drive competitors out of business, then, when no one else is left, they may have the opportunity\nto raise prices so as to maximize their profits. Naturally, the public and public officials are against monopolistic\npricing, but they also are likely to favor lower prices. Therefore, in situations where there are strong economies of\nscale, public agencies will often allow one or a few companies to exist, but regulate their prices and perhaps their\nservices. Examples of publicly owned or regulated monopolies include most transit systems in the United States, most\nagencies that provide water and sewage treatment, and most public utilities.\nProductivity\nProductivity, a classical consideration in economics, is defined as output divided by input.\nProductivity can be\nincreased either by increasing the outputs obtained from the same level of inputs or by reducing the inputs required to\nobtain the same level of output. Improving productivity allows a company, an industry or a society to produce more\nand/or to consume fewer resources. Improving productivity therefore is generally viewed by most everyone as an\nimportant goal. Officials in the private sector believe that productivity improvements will lead to higher profits, while\nthose in the public sector believe that higher productivity will lead to higher income for workers, lower prices for\nconsumers, and better opportunities for growth in the economy. Achieving higher productivity motivates many\ninfrastructure projects.\nMeasuring productivity is complicated by the fact that there are usually multiple types of outputs and inputs. Thus,\nto get the ratio of outputs to inputs it is necessary to have some kind of weighting system for measuring both outputs\nand inputs. For example, in looking at the productivity of the air transportation system, output cannot simply be\nmeasured as the number of passengers or the number of passenger-miles; it is necessary to consider the differences\namong short- and long-distance flights for business and non-business travelers. With water supply systems, it is\nnecessary to distinguish among water supplies for residential, industrial, and agricultural users. With electricity\ncompanies, it is necessary to consider peak loads vs. off-peak loads. In all of these systems, inputs will include many\nfactors that can be summarized under broad headings of labor, capital, land, materials, and energy.\nOne simplifying approach is just to consider a single measure of output and a single factor of production, leading to\nmeasures such as the total number of air passenger trips per airline employee or the amount of electricity generated\nper unit of investment. These single-factor measures tend to be somewhat arbitrary, as production really does require\nmultiple factors, but such measures may be reasonable for measuring productivity changes for a single, fairly stable\noperation.\nAnother possible approach is to weigh outputs by their prices and to weigh inputs by their costs, perhaps using\ninformation from a base year for both prices and cost. If this is done, then the aggregate measure of output will be\nsomething close to \"total revenue\" and the aggregate measure of input will be something close to \"total cost\", and the\nratio of output to input will be the ratio of revenue to cost. A variant of this approach is to assume that prices reflect\nmarginal cost, in which case price can be assumed to be a measure of cost. Since price information is more readily\navailable than cost information, this can be a useful assumption. If there is a meaningful measure of output, then the\ninverse of the price per unit may be a reasonable measure of productivity. Over time, changes in the price per unit\ncan therefore be viewed as an indicator of changes in productivity.\nFor example, tremendous gains in productivity have been achieved in freight transportation over the past 200 years.\nTable 1 shows three factors that contribute to freight productivity: the cost per mile for construction, the tons carried\n\nper vehicle, and the miles traveled per day. The most commonly used measure of output in freight transportation is\nthe ton-mile, which is one ton carried one mile. Typical costs and prices are shown in this table for two periods, the\nearly 19th century and the early 21st century. The costs are current costs, unadjusted for inflation.\nBefore 1800, there were only two types of freight transportation that were generally available: wagons moving over\nbad roads and somewhat larger wagons moving over improved roads, which were usually limited to a few turnpikes\nradiating out from major cities. At that time, a turnpike was often just a dirt road that was maintained to allow slightly\nheavier vehicles to travel the straightest possible path between two towns. When using the turnpike, it was possible\nto use a larger wagon and to go a little faster simply because the road was smoother and a bit wider. Even with the\nturnpikes, transport was slow and expensive, and typical prices exceeded 15 cents per ton-mile.\nTable 1 Increasing the Productivity of Freight Transportation\nTechnology\nCost per Mile to\nConstruct\nTons/vehicle\nMiles/day\nTon-miles per\nvehicle day\nTypical Prices\n(cents/ ton-mile\nEarly 19th Century\nRough road\n$1-2,000\n1 per wagon\n20 to 40\nTurnpike\n$5-10,000\n1.5 per wagon\n15 to 20\nCanal\n>$20,000\n10 to 100 per\ncanal boat\n20 to 30\n200 to 3,000\n5 to 10\nRailroad\n$15-50,000\n500 per train\n100,000 per\ntrain\n3 to 5\nEarly 21st Century\nArterial roads\n$1-5 million\n10 per truck\n10 to 50\nInterstate\nHighway\n$5-100 million\n20 per trailer\n10,000\n10 to 15\nHeavy-haul\nrailroad\n$1-5 million\n5-15,000 per\ntrain\n5 million per\ntrain\nInland\nwaterway\nHighly variable\n1500 per barge;\nup to 40 barges\nper tow\n50-200\n6 million per\ntow\nRivers and canals allowed larger loads and longer daily hauls, as it is much easier to pull a canal boat along a river\nthan to drive a horse and wagon up and down the hills. In the early 19th century, canals were built for upwards of\n$20,000 per mile; the expense was justified by the increased productivity for the freight carriers, and typical freight\nrates fell below ten cents per ton-mile. Canals were limited by geography, so rail technology had a great advantage as\nsoon as it became available. Even with only 500 tons per train, a railroad allowed much more productive freight\noperations than was possible with small canal boats, and typical freight prices dropped below five cents per ton-mile.\nTechnological improvements continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, so that today, the prices for freight\ntransportation are actually lower than they were 200 years ago. The lowest prices are achieved for fully loaded vehicles\ntraveling at the maximum speed on the main routes - tractor/trailer combination trucks on the Interstate Highway,\nheavy coal trains on high density, well-maintained rail lines (Figure 5), and tows of 40 barges moving along the major\nrivers.\nThis example used the ton-mile as a simple measure of output for freight transportation, even though the costs and\nbenefits of transporting different commodities different distances can vary widely. For example, it is easier to move\ncoal in single shipments of 10,000 tons than it is to move 10,000 tons of general merchandise as 200 separate\nshipments. Nevertheless, even though the ton-mile is far from a perfect measure of rail output, the cost/ton-mile\nremains useful in highlighting the dramatic productivity improvements that have been achieved in freight\ntransportation.\nPerceived productivity problems often suggest the types of projects that need to be undertaken:\n\n-\nPeak demands may cause delays at bottlenecks in transportation or systems (so consider investing to relieve\nbottlenecks).\n-\nEngineering constraints, such as weight limits on bridges or band-width limitations in communications\nnetworks, may restrict the usage of the system (so consider investing to increase the ability of the\ninfrastructure to handle larger or heavier loads or higher volumes of usage).\n-\nLack of communication and control may inhibit efficient use of resources (so consider investing in\ncommunications and control systems).\n-\nFacilities that were designed and built many years ago may no longer match what is needed today or in the\nfuture (so consider rehabilitating or expanding or redesigning facilities or networks).\nFigure 5: Coal trains carrying up to 15,000 tons of coal\noperate on narrow rights of way through difficult territory\nlike this canyon in Colorado. A double-track route like this\ncan handle more than 100 million tons of freight per year -\nplus a pair of 79 mph passenger trains. The interstate\nhighway is visible on the other side of the river. To minimize\nits footprint, it was double-decked for a portion of the route.\nThere is also a bike path beneath the highway.\nPhoto: S.J. Martland 2000.\nImage courtesy of Samuel J. Martland. Used with permission.\nMeasuring and Improving the Economy\nInfrastructure projects have impacts that go well beyond the financial affairs of owners and users. Infrastructure\nallows and supports other economic activity, and the greatest benefits of investment in infrastructure may be the new\nopportunities made available to society. In evaluating large infrastructure projects, two types of economic impacts\nare commonly considered:\n-\nThe short-term boost to the local economy resulting from the planning and construction of the project.\n-\nThe long-term impact of the project on the region's economy once the project is completed, including the\nbenefits to users of the new infrastructure as well as the permanent jobs directly linked to the project.\nConstructing a light-rail line to the airport in order to relieve highway congestion and improve access does much more\nthan provide jobs for operating the trains and maintaining the tracks; it also saves time for air travelers, airport\n\nemployees, commuters who use the new line, and highway commuters who experience less congestion, as well as\ncreating opportunities for developing real estate near the light-rail stations.\nShort Term Economic Impacts: the Multiplier Effect of New Investment\nThe design and construction of a major project boosts the economy, because of what is known as the multiplier effect.\nConsider the construction of a new building in a city. Much of the investment cost will be made up of wages and\nsalaries paid to local construction workers and payments to local merchants for materials and services. These workers\nmay save some of their wages, but they are likely to spend most of it; likewise, the local suppliers will spend most of\nwhat they receive.\nThe proportion of the new income that they consume is called the marginal propensity to\nconsume.\nLet's say that the construction of the building resulted in wage payments of $1 million to local workers and companies.\nThis $1 million will in itself be an addition to the regional economy, but that is just part of the story. If the marginal\npropensity to consume is 0.5, then workers and companies will spend another $0.5 million - which will be another\naddition to the local economy. And that $0.5 million will go to other workers and companies who will save some and\nspend some. If they also save half and spend the rest, then there will be another $0.25 million added to the regional\neconomy. And some of that money will also be spent. If half of the money is saved at each step, then the total addition\nto the regional economy will be $1 million (1 + 0.5 +0.25 + 0.125 + ...) which will converge to $2 million dollars. In\nthis case, the multiplier is 2, as each dollar invested leads to an increase of $2 in the regional economy.\nIn general, the total addition to the economy can be expressed as a function of the marginal propensity to consume\nMPC:\n(Eq. 10)\nAddition to economy = Investment in Region (1 + MPC + MPC2 + MPC3 + ...)\nSo long as MPC is less than 1, this sequence converges to 1/(1-MPC). The factor (1-MPC) is the marginal propensity\nto save, so the multiplier effect increases inversely with the marginal propensity to save:\n(Eq. 11)\nMultiplier Effect = 1/(1-MPC)\nFor example, if the marginal propensity to consume increases from 0.5 to 0.75, then the marginal propensity to save\ndrops to 0.25. If so, then more money goes into the economy. The total addition to the regional economy would be:\n(Eq. 12)\n$1 million (1+.75+.75(.75)+(.75)(.75)(.75) ...) = $1million/(.25) = $4 million\nWith less money going into savings, the multiplier effect jumps from 2 to 4.\nThe multiplier effect would apply both to the construction phase and to the operations phase of a project. For\ninfrastructure projects, however, since investment costs are so much higher than continuing costs, the greatest interest\nis in the multiplier effect from the investment. Multipliers are typically found to be between 2 and 3 for transportation\nand other infrastructure projects. Note that the multiplier effect relates only to the money spent within the region, so\nthat a project that imported costly materials and used highly automated equipment would have a much lower regional\nimpact than a more labor intensive project that used local labor and materials.\nThe presence of a multiplier effect motivates governments to initiate stimulus programs during a recession. In the\nshort-run, the stimulus will be most effective in reviving the economy if it is directed toward projects and programs\nthat direct money toward people who will be likely to spend most of what they receive. The long-run economic benefit\nwill depend upon the success of the project in providing permanent jobs, making society more productive, or enabling\nother economic benefits to society.\n\nLong-Term Economic Impacts: Gross Regional Product\nThe most common economic measure used to monitor the health of the economy is the gross domestic product\n(GDP), which equals the sum of private consumption C, investment I, and government expenditures on goods and\nservices G plus exports E minus imports M:\n(Eq. 13)\nGDP = C + I + G + E - M\nThe growth in the economy is measured as the change in GDP, and growth in GDP is generally viewed as a critical\nobjective for a nation. A growing economy provides opportunities for more jobs, higher wages, provision of more\ngoods and services, and higher profits for companies. If GDP declines for two successive quarters, then the economy\nis said to be in a recession. Unemployment rises during recessions, wages may fall, and company profits decline.\nThus, maintaining GDP is an important economic objective for a nation.\nGDP is not a perfect measure, in part because there is more to life than economics. Even in the realm of economics,\nhowever, there is a major problem with GDP, because it fails to account for the losses associated with the depreciation\nof the capital stock of the country. Machines wear out, buildings age, infrastructure deteriorates, and these losses from\ndepreciation will not be captured until and unless repairs are made or facilities are replaced. The net domestic product\nis calculated by subtracting total depreciation from GDP. Net domestic product is less commonly used because it is\ndifficult to estimate depreciation of assets, while it is relatively easy to monitor consumer purchases, investments,\ngovernment expenditures and foreign trade.\nSince the two measures will usually rise and fall in tandem, the GDP\nfigure is what is most frequently used.\nGDP is an aggregate measure that will not reflect conditions for particular regions, groups of people or sectors of the\neconomy. However, similar measures can be estimated for each region of a country. The gross regional product\n(GRP) would be defined in the same manner, with the various factors defined so as to apply to the region, not to the\nnation. As with the national economy, growth in GRP will be a major economic objective for any region.\nJobs and average income are other important aspects of the regional economy. Adding jobs to the regional economy\nis always viewed positively, but especially so during a period of high unemployment. Higher-paying jobs are\npreferred, and local governments may provide tax breaks and other incentives to attract or to retain companies that\nhave such jobs.\nEconomic models can be constructed to predict the impact of infrastructure investment on the regional economy.\nSuch models may be able to show that transportation investments will make the region more attractive to new\nbusinesses or that investments in dams and irrigation will make local agriculture more profitable, leading to growth in\nall activities related to agriculture. Analysis may also show that investment in infrastructure is expected to have a\nmeasurable impact on congestion, public safety, or public health.\nSavings in time, reductions in risk, and\nimprovements in health can be translated into economic benefits by using the average value of time for commuters,\nthe expected savings in accident costs, and the expected reduction in health care costs. While such benefits do not\nresult in cash flows that help pay for infrastructure investments, they are quantifiable factors that can help justify (and\ngain public approval for) public investments.\nTrade\nA great deal of infrastructure investment is based upon projections for population growth and growth in regional\neconomies. Over the long-term, both types of growth depend to a large extent upon forces that act on a national or\ninternational scale, such as technological change and trade. Technological change results in new products, new\nmaterials, new development opportunities, and new processes for manufacturing and distribution. Over time, there\ncan be marked changes in what types of things are produced, how and where they are produced, and how they are\ndistributed around the world. These changes influence and respond to changes in economic geography, i.e. the\n\nlocation of people and economic activities throughout a region, a nation, or the world. And it is these changes in\neconomic geography that require and motivate many investments in infrastructure.\nTrade is the exchange of goods among regions or countries. Transportation makes trade possible. Differences in\nregional resources, economies of scale in production, and differences in costs and capabilities make trade desirable.\nThe ability to exchange currencies of different countries and to transfer monies between countries makes trade\nfinancially feasible. The ability of wealthy countries to buy vast amounts of goods and materials makes trade flourish.\nTwo key concepts are helpful in understanding how trade works and why trade is important. First, if it is possible to\nproduce something for a lower cost in one region than in another, then there is an opportunity for trade, but only if\ntransport costs are sufficiently low.\nSpatial price equilibrium is the process by which transport costs and\nmanufacturing costs together determine prices for products that can be produced in one area and sold in another.\nSecond, it makes sense economically for different regions to exploit their comparative advantage, i.e. to concentrate\non what they each do best. Understanding these concepts is essential to understanding the global economy, and\nrecognition that there is a global economy is essential for understanding the kinds of infrastructure investment that\nwill be needed to support industrial production, trade, and population growth.\nSpatial Price Equilibrium\nTo begin, consider a product that can be made in two locations. At location \"a\", production costs are lower than at\nlocation \"b\". The producers at \"a\" and \"b\" compete with each other for business in their region. Although costs are\nlower at location \"a\", there are two major reasons why they might not capture all of the business. First of all, costs\nare not prices. Manufacturer A may decide to charge whatever Manufacturer B charges, so that they will share\nwhatever market is available - and Manufacturer A will have higher profits. Second, transportation costs must be\nadded to the manufacturing costs, and the prices for the products must cover the total cost.\nFigure 6 illustrates how transport costs will affect the markets captured by each manufacturer. The x-axis of this chart\nrepresents distance. Manufacturer A is located at point \"a\" and Manufacturer B is located at point \"b\". The y-axis\nrepresents the sum of manufacturing and distribution cost. The costs of manufacturing Ma and Mb are indicated by\nthe vertical lines at a and b; costs are much lower at a.\nFigure 6 Spatial Price Equilibrium\nProduction Cost\nProduction plus\nTransport Cost\na\nb\n$/unit\nDistance\nAssume that transport costs Tax from Manufacturer A to any potential location X are proportional to the distance Dax\nfrom the manufacturer:\n(Eq. 14)\nTax = kaxDax\nThus, if Manufacturer A decides to market its product at location X, then the total cost will be:\n(Eq. 15)\nCa = Ma + Tax = Ma + kaxDax\n\nA similar equation would apply for Manufacturer B:\n(Eq. 16)\nCb = Mb + kbxDb\nThe total costs Ca and Cb are both plotted in Figure 6. The costs for each manufacturer are Y-shaped, as total costs\nrise linearly by moving in either direction in this two-dimensional figure. The slope of the total cost line is the cost\nper mile for transporting the product, which is kax for Manufacturer A and kbx for Manufacturer B. The slope is steeper\nfor Manufacturer B, indicating that transportation costs are more expensive for that manufacturer. Manufacturer A\nwill presumably capture the market for all locations where its total costs are less than those of Manufacturer B. At\npoints where they are equal, the manufacturers will share the market. In the two-dimensional world depicted above\nin Figure 6, the total cost lines intersect in two places, one just to the left of Manufacturer b's location on the graph\nand one a little further to the right of that location. This indicates that Manufacturer B will only be serving its local\nmarket, while Manufacturer A will capture all of the rest.\nIn general, if two manufacturers of identical products are competitive in a market, then they must be charging the\nsame price at that location. For a manufacture to compete and make a profit, the sum of their production cost plus\ntransportation cost must be less than or equal to the prevailing price at that location. Prices will vary from one location\nto another, reflecting the differences in production and transportation cost. Over time, if transportation and production\ntechnologies are stable, a spatial price equilibrium will be achieved, and the markets served by each manufacturer will\nbe well-defined.\nOf course, neither production nor transportation technologies remain stable for very long. As we have already seen\nin this chapter, transportation costs have declined dramatically over the past 200 years, enabling today's manufacturers\nto compete globally. With low cost global distribution feasible, it makes sense a) to have large manufacturing facilities\nthat take advantage of whatever economies of scale can be found in manufacturing and b) to have those manufacturers\nlocated in regions where costs are lowest, whether because of local labor rates or the local energy costs or the\ngeographical position relative to sources of inputs and major markets. Because of the tremendous improvements in\nfreight transportation productivity, it is now feasible to manufacturer many consumer goods in Asia, where labor and\nproduction costs are very low, and to ship those goods on large container ships to major ports for distribution\nthroughout the rest of the world.\nComparative Advantage\nThe unequal distribution of resources, including capital and skilled labor as well as natural resources, is another force\npromoting trade. Because of accidents of location or history, one region may be able to produce certain products at a\nlower cost or higher quality than other regions. If this region makes an excess amount of such products, then it can\nsell them to other regions and use the proceeds to purchase other types of goods from those regions. For example,\none country may be very good at making automobiles, while another country is very good at agriculture. Opportunities\nfor trade would seem pretty clear: trade automobiles for food, and allow the country to concentrate on the products\nwhere they are the best.\nThe potential benefits of specialization were first highlighted nearly two hundred years ago by David Ricardo, who\ndeveloped the theory of comparative advantage in 1817. Samuelson summarized this theory as follows:\n\"Whether or not one of two regions is absolutely more efficient in the production of every good than is the\nother, if each specializes in the products in which it has a comparative advantage (greatest relative\nefficiency), trade will be mutually profitable to both regions. Real wages of productive workers will rise in\nboth places.\"2\n2 Paul Samuelson, Economics: An Introductory Analysis, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1964, 6th edition, p. 665.\n\nThis theory is the basis for reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade. Tariffs are taxes that are charged on inputs as\na means of protecting local manufacturing. However, the theory of comparative advantage indicates that it is better\nto allow imports, so that local workers and local capital can be put to work more productively in areas where the region\nenjoys its greatest efficiency relative to other regions.\nCurrency Exchange and International Banking\nInternational trade depends upon a banking system that is able to do two things. First, there must be a common\nmedium of exchange, so that the money used in one country can be used or converted into an amount of another\ncountry's money that has the same value. Second, it is necessary to have some system of credit so that a person in one\ncountry can borrow the funds needed to buy goods that will be exported from a second country and perhaps transported\nand sold in a third country.\nToday, when it is easy to stick a credit card into an ATM to get local currency when traveling abroad, it is difficult\nto imagine how important - and how difficult - it was for traders to have access to a banking system in order to carry\nout their business without personally carrying vast sums wherever they went.\nThe exchange rates between currencies can be based upon market forces or regulatory forces. Major newspapers\nprovide daily reports on the exchange rates for the major currencies. In early 2009, for example, $1.00 was worth\nabout 0.77 euros or, to put it the other way around, one euro was worth about $1.30.\nAt times, exchange rates will be quite volatile. In September 2008, when I traveled to Ireland, the euro was worth\n$1.60. While I was in Europe, there was a worldwide credit crisis, major banks appeared in imminent danger of\ncollapse, and the value of the euro dropped to about $1.35 by the end of my vacation. Although the prices of our\nhotels and our meals remained unchanged - in euros - it appeared to us as though everything was now 15% off! This\nchange made our trip a little bit cheaper, but this same change affected every transaction between anyone in the U.S.\ndoing business with anyone in Europe. Suddenly, everything priced in euros was 15% cheaper for anyone who had\ndollars to spend - and everything priced in dollars was 15% more expensive for anyone who had euros to spend. A\nchange of this magnitude is equivalent to putting a 15% tariff on everything exported from the US into Europe and\nhaving a 15% sale on everything imported to the US from Europe. Changes of this magnitude have broad\nrepercussions on international trade and travel, even without a credit crisis.\nA credit crisis can be devastating to trade and economic growth. Without credit, it is hard for businesses to get the\nloans they need to expand production and it is hard for consumers to borrow money to buy houses, cars and other\nitems. The credit crisis in late 2008 and early 2009 resulted in stock markets plunging, the auto industry teetering\nupon bankruptcy, and many banks and investment banks collapsing. Without credit, trade declined abruptly and the\nworld economy slipped into a serious recession.\nMaking Decisions: Utility and Sunk Costs\nEconomists use the concept of utility as a way to understand how individuals make decisions. It is assumed that\npeople act so as to maximize their utility, subject to budgets for both time and money. Utility is a useful concept, even\nthough few of us will be able to say why we do or do not do something or why we prefer one product over another. It\nis possible to study utility by documenting the choices that people make or by conducting surveys, i.e. by considering\nwhat are called observed preferences or stated preferences. Analysis of actual choices is likely to provide better\ninsight into behavior, but it is much easier to obtain detailed information by using surveys and documenting stated\npreferences. For example, a survey could ask people to say whether or not they would buy a particular product for\nvarious prices. More complex surveys could be devised to explore quality of service, timing, and other factors that\nmight be important in addition to price.\nFor example, consider the journey to work. A person may have the choice of driving alone, riding with a friend, or\ntaking the bus. Direct observation may show that this person drives alone 60% of the time, rides with a friend 20%\n\nof the time, and takes the bus 20% of the time. An interviewer can probe further, seeking to understand how cost,\ntravel time, work schedules, weather, errands, and shopping factor into the decision. Utility models may be\nconstructed based upon the actual decisions or the stated preferences. These models will typically include variables\nthat reflect cost, service quality and convenience. The result of a utility analysis will be something like \"people seem\nto value the time spent commuting at something close to their average wage\". Such an estimate of the value of time\ncould be used in estimating the benefits of a transportation project that saved time for commuters or other travelers.\nEconomic decisions concern future costs and benefits. Money spent in the past should not affect what we decide to\ndo today, and such costs can be viewed as sunk costs. For instance, if you are about to buy a new car, and you plan\nto trade in your old car, it does not matter - to you or to the car dealer - what you paid for that car. What matters is\nwhat the car is worth today, which will depend upon the condition of the car and the demand for used cars. On a\nlarger scale, when trying to decide whether or not to buy or sell a building, it does not matter what that building cost\nto build. It is only the market value of the building that will affect the price. Of course, if you have yourself put a\ngreat deal of money into buying a car or your house, you may well perceive that the car or house is worth a lot more\nthan anyone else does, but that is only a factor in deciding whether you are willing to part with it. The current market\nvalue is what should enter your economic analysis.\nSummary\nThis chapter has introduced supply, demand, equilibrium, competitive and monopolistic pricing, productivity, utility\nand other economic concepts that are relevant to project evaluation. These concepts provide a framework for thinking\nabout needs, projects, and project evaluation.\nSupply and Demand\nThe supply function describes the amount of output that will be provided as a function of the price per unit that is\nsold. The demand function describes the amount of output that will be purchased as a function of the price per unit.\nThe equilibrium price is the price for which supply will equal demand. In most complex systems, there will be\ncontinual changes in both supply and demand, and it is more realistic to think about systems moving toward\nequilibrium rather than always being in equilibrium, especially for systems where it is costly and time-consuming to\nadjust capacity. Congestion, delays and poor quality are likely when demand exceeds supply, while underutilization\nof equipment and reductions in the work force of suppliers will be common when supply exceeds demand.\nThe elasticity of demand with respect to price can be estimated by observing the effects of price changes on demand.\nIf demand is elastic, then demand will be more responsive to price changes, and an increase in price will lead to a\ndecrease in total revenue. Demand tends to be more elastic in the long-run than in the short-run, as people and\nbusinesses will generally find ways to reduce their dependence on higher-priced goods and service.\nProductivity\nProductivity is defined as the ratio of output to input. Improving productivity is an important objective, because\nproductivity improvements make it possible to produce more goods and services using fewer people and resources.\nMany projects eliminate productivity problems related to bottlenecks, constraints on usage, inadequate control, or\noutmoded facilities. Productivity may also be improved by changing the structure, design and size of networks or\nfacilities so as to achieve economies of scale, scope, or density. Scale economies exist when expanding the size of\nthe system leads to reductions in average cost. Scope economies exist when it is cheaper to use facilities for multiple\nuses. Density economies occur in a network when more volume is concentrated on each route.\nPricing\nIn a competitive environment, no individual supplier has the power to set prices, and prices will fall to marginal cost.\nIn infrastructure-based systems, marginal cost pricing will generally be well below average cost as long as the system\nis operating below its design capacity. Thus there may be a need for price regulation or subsidies to ensure that\n\nrevenues are sufficient to cover total costs of operation. If demand approaches capacity, then marginal costs for both\nusers and operators will rise as delays and high utilization levels make it difficult to use and maintain the system.\nIf a supplier has a monopoly, it can set prices well above marginal costs so as to maximize profits. Monopolies may\nalso be slow in adopting new technology or expanding capacity to meet demand, and they may display little concern\nfor service quality. However, for many infrastructure-based systems, there are tremendous economies of scale and\ndensity, so that the cost of service can be greatly reduced by limiting competition. Thus, many transportation\ncompanies and public utilities are allowed to operate as monopolies in order to achieve cost savings, while being\nsubjected to regulation in order to ensure reasonable prices and service.\nMeasuring and Improving the Economy\nPublic officials and the general public are naturally interested in expanding economic output, which is commonly\nmeasured as the gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is the sum of all private consumption, private investment,\ngovernment expenditures and net exports. Other measures of the economy include total jobs, unemployment levels,\nand average income per person or per family. All of these measures can be developed for a region as well as for a\ncountry.\nA major project will have both a direct and an indirect effect on the regional economy. The direct effect will be related\nto the jobs created and the expenditures required to complete and subsequently to operate and maintain the project.\nIn addition, there will be a multiplier effect, because the people who work on the project and the companies that sell\nmaterials to the project will spend much of what they earn, whether on food or cars or housing, and other people and\nother companies will enjoy some added income.\nTrade\nTrade allows regions to specialize in economic activities where they have a comparative advantage relative to other\nregions. By producing more of what they need for some types of products, they are able to trade for other things that\nthey need or desire. The ability to trade is dependent upon the ability to transport goods efficiently between regions,\nbecause of spatial price equilibrium. In order for trade to make sense, the cost of producing something in one\nlocation plus the cost of transporting the product to another location must be less than the price that can be charged in\nthat location. Investments in transportation systems have produced dramatic reductions in transport costs, thereby\nenabling the shift of manufacturing, mining, agricultural production, and other activities to the regions of the world\nwith the lowest costs. The global economy reflects low transportation costs and the fact that there are generally high\neconomies of scale in production.\nBanking and currency exchange are another essential aspect of global trade. Exchange rates between currencies of\ndifferent countries may be determined by market forces or by regulations. Over time, exchange rates may vary\nsubstantially, which will tend to change the patterns of trade by making some countries relatively cheaper and other\nrelatively more expensive. Growth in trade and changes in trade routes are important considerations in many\ninfrastructure projects.\nMaking Decisions\nDespite the fact that we know ourselves often to be less than rational in our decisions, economists assume that\nindividuals will generally make decisions so as to maximize their own utility. Utility is a rather vague - but thoroughly\nuseful - concept that can incorporate disparate factors such as cost, convenience, reliability, safety or aesthetics that\nmight affect our choice of a new car, a new house, or where to eat dinner. By observing what decisions people make\n(revealed preferences) or asking people about hypothetical choices (stated preferences), it is possible to infer what\nfactors they consider in making choices. Those who plan projects must, at some level, consider how many people\nwill use the completed project (road, water system, park or office building) and how much they will be willing to pay\nfor their use of it.\n\nWhen evaluating proposals, only future costs and benefits need to be considered. Money spent in the past is a sunk\ncost. Whether that money was well-spent or wasted does not and should not affect decisions concerning what to do\nin the future.\nManchester, New Hampshire\nWater power enabled Manchester to become a dominant manufacturing center during the 19th century.\nWhen the mills closed, the old buildings were transferred into office space museums, restaurants, and\nsmall businesses, and walkways were constructed along the Merrimac River in order to attract visitors.\n\nPublic Perspectives: Economic, Environmental and Social Concerns\nHappiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of\ncreative effort. The joy and stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of\nevanescent profits. These dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny\nis not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellowmen. ... Our greatest\nprimary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and\ncourageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the government itself, treating\nthe task as we would treat the emergence of a war, but, at the same time, through this employment,\naccomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources.\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, president of the United States, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1933\n(Record, 73 Congress, Special Session of the Senate, pp. 5-6)\nOverview\nThe public sector, which is responsible for many kinds of infrastructure systems, takes an entirely different perspective\nthan the private sector when identifying needs and evaluating potential projects. The primary motivation for the\nprivate sector projects will be the financial returns to the owners, not the broader effects on the economy or society.\nFor the public sector, the motivation is not to earn money, but to satisfy public needs or to promote growth in the\neconomy. Financial issues are important, but not necessarily dominant, and every major project will have multiple\npurposes and multiple measures of effectiveness (Table 1). Social and environmental impacts are central to the public\nevaluation process, and equity in the distribution of costs and benefits will be critical. In dealing with non-monetary\nobjectives, cost effectiveness will be a more relevant concept than return on investment: which of the proposed\nalternatives is the best way to achieve the desired objectives?\nTable 1 Examples of Public Infrastructure: Multiple Purposes and Multiple Measures\nType of\nInfrastructure\nPurpose\nMeasures\nTransportation\nMobility\nAccessibility\nRegional competitiveness\nService levels (travel time, congestion)\nCost of transportation\nFuel consumption\nSafety\nEmissions\nDams\nFlood control\nIrrigation\nHydropower\nRecreation (boating, swimming,\ncamping, picnic sites)\nRisks associated with floods\nVolume of water available for irrigation\nLand area to be irrigated\nElectricity production (cost & revenue)\nImpact on wildlife\nWater & sewage\nClean water for consumption\nWater for industry & irrigation\nVolume of water available for each type of use\nCleanliness (risk of disease)\nCost per unit\nPublic Housing\nHousing for elderly\nHousing for low income\nresidents\nHousing for homeless\nNumber of units\nSize and quality of buildings\nCost per unit (construction & operation)\nSafety & Security\nAesthetics\nParks & recreation\nOpen space for residents\nProtect environment\nAesthetics\nOpen space as % of total space\nVisitors per year\nDiversity of wildlife\nSafety\n\nAnother difference is that the time frame of the analysis will be much longer for the public than for the private sector,\nas the public entity is presumed to endure indefinitely. The long time frame requires the consideration of sustainability\n- will projects or programs be sustainable over long periods of time taking into account economic, financial, social,\nand environmental factors?\nFor many kinds of public infrastructure projects, the tolls, fees, and other direct revenues from the project will be\ninsufficient to cover the costs of the investment. However, the non-monetary benefits could be considerable. A public\ntransportation project may relieve congestion, improve air quality, and promote mobility for those without access to\nan automobile. While these benefits can at times be quantified by using concepts like consumer surplus or the\nmultiplier effect of new investment, such benefits do not produce cash flows that cover the interest on bonds or the\noperating costs of the transit agency. If the benefits are clear, and if the public generally believes that these benefits\nare worthwhile, then public agencies may be able to use tax revenues to supplement the direct cash flows from the\nproject. If taxes are used to finance a project, then that project will be competing not just against similar projects, but\nagainst all of the other projects that might be undertaken by that city, state or country. Transportation projects compete\nwith housing for the elderly, and water projects compete with health care projects. Decisions for or against projects\nwill be political decisions, and the relative importance of various kinds of costs and benefits will be subject to\nconsiderable debate.\nTo complicate the situation further, a project will also be evaluated in terms of its impact on the community:\n-\nEconomic impacts, including employment, regional economic growth, regional competitiveness\n-\nEnvironmental impacts, including air quality, water quality, noise, loss of wetlands, and impact on\necosystems.\n-\nEquity, including the distribution of costs and benefits across regions and groups of the population and the\nrelative impact on current and future generations.\n-\nAesthetics, including the appearance of the new infrastructure, its effect on neighboring areas, and its effect\non long-term changes in land use.\n-\nOther social impacts, including such things as impacts on communities during construction, displacement of\nresidents, and long-term changes in population distribution\nMultiple objectives and multiple measures mean that these projects are inherently complex, with many conflicts\npossible among different objectives. The decision-makers ultimately will include the public, who may have a chance\nto vote for or against the funding sources proposed for a project, and the politicians or appointed officials who must\njustify their decisions to the public in order to be re-elected or to retain their jobs. Large projects will be politically\nsensitive, and it will be necessary to consider and to balance all of the conflicts. There will be real and apparent\nconflicts of interest among those who are supposed to be proposing, evaluating, and approving projects. It will not be\npossible to satisfy everybody, and there will likely be determined opposition to almost any major project. People\ncommonly do not want anything built too close to them, even if they are going to be major beneficiaries of the project.\nThis phenomenon, which can lead to intense community opposition, is known as the NIMBY response: \"not in my\nbackyard\".\nIn summary, a major public project will be evaluated by many different groups of people, from many perspectives,\nwith varying concerns for the relative importance of various features of the projects, and with potential disputes about\nhow to measure or estimate costs and benefits.\nBenefit/Cost Analysis\nPublic projects require an evaluation process that includes, but is much broader than financial analysis. A simple\ndictum is mandated both by law and by common sense: for any public project, the total benefits should exceed the\ntotal costs. This does not mean that every project with more benefits than costs is a good project; it simply means that\nprojects whose costs exceed their benefits are bad projects that should not be funded by the public. This may seem to\n\nbe a rather obvious principle, but it surely is necessary, as there are many instances of projects being built, at taxpayer\nexpense, whose costs far exceeded their benefits. There are even names for such projects: \"gold plated\" projects that\ncould have been constructed for far less money; \"pork barrel\" projects that were approved in order to get a crucial\npolitician's support for some larger political scheme; and \"white elephants\" that are constructed at great expense, but\nthat afford no greater benefits than ordinary elephants! The political process can provide a means to fund many\ndifferent projects, and it is possible that many projects will be \"earmarked\" (i.e. specifically authorized in the\nlegislation) rather than subjected to a rigorous examination of their costs and benefits. A requirement that the benefits\nof every project should exceed the costs is therefore a step toward a more rational allocation of public funds and a\ndefense against mismanagement, stupidity, and corruption.\nMeasurement will be a major problem in determining whether or not costs exceed benefits: how can different types\nof non-cash costs and benefits be converted to monetary terms? How can important benefits such as savings in travel\ntime or reductions in risk of accidents be converted into monetary terms? What about aesthetics? In some cases, the\nmonetarization is straightforward; in other cases it is convoluted and controversial; and in still others it is essentially\nimpossible.\nFor example, consider a proposal to construct a new highway that is intended to provide a safer, more attractive route\naround the congested core of a city. The basic question is whether the savings in travel time, the expected reduction\nin fatalities, and the prettier route justify the cost and the environmental impacts of constructing the highway through\nthe surrounding region.\nTravel time: Traffic engineers are able to model how commuters, truckers, and others will use the new facility, and\nthey will be able to predict traffic flows on the new facility along with the changes in traffic flows on other facilities.\nBased upon the changes in traffic flows, they will be able to predict travel times on the new road and changes in\naverage travel time on each segment of the existing network. The overall effect can be summarized as a reduction in\ntravel time measured as vehicle-hours per day or per year, with details for commuters, local delivery trucks, long-\ndistance trucks traveling through the region, and any other group of interest. The value of these time savings is\ncommonly estimated by making a series of assumptions. For instance, the time saved by commuters could be valued\nby using the average hourly wage for workers in the region, and the value of time saved by truckers could be valued\nby using the average hourly wage for truck drivers, the hourly cost of truck ownership, and the hourly value of the\ncontents of the truck. Some might argue that something less than the average hourly wage should be used, and others\nmight challenge the methodology used to estimate the hourly cost of truck ownership, but these estimates of the value\nof time are commonly accepted, and the benefits are clear and verifiable.\nSafety: estimating the value of the safety benefits will be trickier. Traffic engineers will be able to predict the number\nand severity of accidents based upon traffic flows and highway geometry, and safety analysts can use past history to\nquantify the expected damage to vehicles and the highway. However, no one can readily place an economic value on\nthe most important safety benefits, namely a reduction in the expected number of injuries or fatalities.\nInstead,\ndepartments of transportation in some countries will consider the value to society of reducing fatalities and serious\ninjuries resulting from automobile and other transportation accidents. In the United States, the U.S. Department of\nTransportation uses a value of approximately $2.5 million in its risk analysis. This amount represents the benefit to\nsociety of eliminating a single, future fatality. It does not represent the value of a human life, for it is impossible to\nsay who would have been hurt or killed. In effect, the $2.5 million can be viewed as an aggregate benefit to all users\nof the system of a slight reduction in the probability of a fatal accident. Every user benefits because the probability\nof an accident is reduced.\nAesthetics: now we are close to the \"impossible\" in trying to quantify the benefits of the new highway. Whether or\nnot aesthetics is viewed as an important component of the decision will depend upon the political situation in the\nregion. It could be viewed as an afterthought, which might mean planting some flowers along the right-of-way, or it\ncould be a major design consideration, as in the construction of roads in national parks or the construction of parkways\ninto major cities. The argument may well boil down to someone showing artist's renditions of the options (or photos\nof similar projects elsewhere) and saying something like \"isn't it worth spending an extra $5 million to get a nice\n\nfacility?\" If people agree that \"$5 million\" is a small amount, then they will choose the more aesthetic option. If\npeople note that $5 million\" is equivalent to the park budget for 20 years, then they will probably be vocal in their\nopposition!\nEconomic Impacts: Measures Related to the Regional or National Economy\nGovernments and public agencies will be concerned with the effects of projects on the local, regional, or national\neconomy. Primary measures will include gross regional or national product, jobs created or lost, average income, and\npersonal and industrial productivity. These economic benefits could come from several types of benefits:\n-\nConstruction jobs and income\n-\nThe multiplier effect of construction\n-\nJobs and income related to the eventual operation of the new project\n-\nThe multiplier effect of operation of the new project\n-\nContinuing productivity benefits resulting to citizens, users, industries or public agencies as a result of the\nproject\n-\nGrowth in the economy related to the productivity benefits provided by the project\nFor example, consider the construction of a toll road. The initial construction may take two years, provide hundreds\nof jobs, and increase sales of construction materials within the region. The direct expenditure of several hundred\nmillion dollars would have a multiplier effect that would more than double the economic benefit to the region during\nthe period of construction. Once the toll road is opened, there could be long-term jobs for toll-collectors (or for those\nwho maintain any electronic toll collection devices) and for highway maintenance forces, providing both a direct and\na multiplier effect to the regional economy. The toll road presumably offers benefits to the public in terms of higher\ncapacity for rush hour traffic, reduced risks of accidents, and perhaps reduced travel time. With less congested\nhighways, the region may be able to continue to attract new businesses and to absorb additional population growth.\nLand near interchanges is likely to increase in value and attract hotels, restaurants, trucking terminals, warehouses,\nand other businesses that depend on highway access or serve highway users.\nThese benefits could be offset by the impacts of both the construction and the continued operation of the highway.\nDisruption of normal activities can be a major economic cost of a highway project. Although construction of a new\nhighway interchange will ultimately relieve congestion, it may cause increased delays for a year or two. Once the\nhighway is built, it may act as a barrier that limits access between different parts of the region. Over time, land use\nwill adjust to the existence of the highway, which could result in rapid growth in some areas and equally rapid declines\nin other areas.\nEnvironmental impacts\nAny project will alter the complex relationships between what might be thought of as the natural world and the\nmanmade world. Construction activities convert more space from the natural to the manmade world. Projects require\nconstruction materials such as wood, steel, and concrete which ultimately depend upon activities such as forestry,\nmining, and manufacturing that certainly disrupt and may at times destroy the environment. Continued operation and\nmaintenance of infrastructure require energy and other materials that ultimately come from the natural world. Normal\noperations, accidents and decay may release toxic substances that can affect air quality, water quality, soil composition\nand limit or destroy the ability of plants and animals to survive near project sites. Constructed facilities will cast\nshadows, they may be noisy, and they might just be ugly or interfere with people's day-to-day lives. Whether or not\nthe benefits of the project are worth the environmental costs will always be a relevant question, especially when those\nreceiving the benefits are not those who bear the costs. The extent to which this question is considered will depend\nupon the social, cultural and political institutions.\nIn many countries, developers must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) that at least states the goals of\na project, presents major alternatives for achieving these goals, identifies the major environmental impacts, and\n\nsuggests ways to mitigate the most negative impacts. Preparing an EIS ensures that information is made available to\nthe public and to public officials who must approve a project; the extent to which environmental considerations affect\ndecisions about a project may well depend upon legal and political battles.\nCourts and legislative bodies are well-structured for dealing with controversial trade-offs between environmental and\neconomic issues and the extent to which developers must deal with environmental concerns. Legislation has limited\nthe development of wetlands, promoted soil and water conservation, required more fuel-efficient automobiles, and\nlimited land use via zoning and other restrictive matters. However, courts and legislative bodies are not well-structured\nfor dealing with the underlying science, as evidenced by the controversies related to the extent of, the causes of, and\nthe possibilities of responding to global warming and climate change.\nMankind has certainly transformed the world. Over a period of many thousands of years, humans have converted vast\nportions of the earth's land area to agriculture, drained innumerable wetlands, developed much of the land near the\noceans, seas, and major rivers, and cut down vast areas of forest. These activities have changed the chemistry of the\natmosphere, altered the natural flows of fresh water, and restricted the natural habitats crucial for many species of\nplants and animals. These activities have also allowed humans to prosper by helping to ensure adequate food supply,\nclean water, housing, abundant energy sources, and protection against floods and other natural disasters.\nIn the\nfuture, we will still eat, drink, use energy and improve the way we live - but we will have to pay more attention to our\nimpact on the environment.\nThere will be a whole of range of environmental issues that must be addressed in evaluating any major project, and\nthere will be many major projects whose primary objective will be to improve the environment. Environmental issues\nwill range from very local debates as to what gets built in whose backyard to regional and national questions related\nto the use of resources to international questions concerning the future of the planet. Since we can't expect to answer\nall of these questions every time we want to build a new hotel or new segment of a highway, we need to provide a\nreasonable structure for addressing these issues within the project evaluation process.\nEnvironmental Concerns\nLet's start by considering some basic environmental concerns. Soil, water, sunlight, and temperature are among the\nfactors that determine what plants can grow in any location. Plants that are well-adapted to local conditions will\nprosper, those that are poorly adapted will struggle, and those that cannot survive the extremes of temperature or\nhydrological conditions will never gain more than a short-term foothold. Insects, birds and small mammals are\nnecessary to the propagation of many plant species, and worms, amphibians, and insects make soil into a complex,\nliving community. Animals may feed on plants or other animals, and they prosper in locations where there is an\nabundance of food along with sufficient cover for their own safety and appropriate places to raise a family, whether\nin trees, burrows, rotten logs, stream banks, or wetlands.\nLeft undisturbed, any location will eventually develop with a characteristic set of plants and animals that can survive\nor flourish within the constraints posed by soil conditions, sunlight, and climate. Biologists have identified distinct\necosystems that can be characterized by the kinds of plants and animals that will be found there. Within any healthy\necosystem, there will be a diversity of species, each of which is somehow related to the health of the overall system.\nPileated woodpeckers make holes in dead trees as they look for insects, and these holes are later used as nesting sites\nfor chickadees. When the dead tree finally collapses, it will provide cover for mice and other small rodents, as well\nas an ideal place for fungi to grow or for grouse and hares to hide.\nIn many cases, there are species that will only be found in certain ecosystems, so that they can be considered to be\nindicator species that are useful in documenting the existence of unusual ecosystems. For instance, wood frogs lay\ntheir eggs in vernal pools, which are small pools that are formed in rainy seasons or in spring as the snow melts.\nVernal pools dry up for part of the year, so they cannot support fish, which means that eggs deposited in a vernal pool\nwill be safe from predation from fish. Wood frogs are an indicator species for vernal pools. A single female wood\nfrog lays hundreds of eggs in the early spring, so if the pool retains water long enough for the eggs to turn into tadpoles\n\nand for tadpoles to grow into tiny frogs, then the wood frogs will prosper. If the vernal pools are filled as part of the\nprocess of building a parking lot or a suburban sub-division, then the wood frogs will die off.\nIn most regions, a few types of ecosystem will dominate the landscape, while a dozen or more other types will be\ncommonly scattered throughout, and some will be found only in a few locations. Preserving the rare ecosystems may\nbe essential for preserving bio-diversity, as there will be plants and animals that are only to be found in those locations.\nPreserving a good distribution of the more common ecosystems will prevent populations of plants and animals from\nbecoming too isolated. Preserving large tracts of the dominant ecosystems will ensure healthy conditions for all of\nthe region's most common species.\nEcosystems can be harmed in several ways. Pollution - the introduction of foreign elements into the air, the water,\nor the soil - may lead to the death of certain plants or insects and of the animals that depend upon eating them.\nPollution could be in the form of toxic chemicals that are poisonous to certain species, but it could also just be the\nintroduction of sediment into a pristine stream, thereby making the water quality unsuitable for certain types of fish.\nPollution can also refer to the heated water that is discharged from a nuclear power plant, as the heated water will be\nlethal to the some species, while attracting others that may be alien to the previously existing ecosystem.\nDisruptions to the flow and retention of water can have devastating effects on ecosystems. Draining wetlands to\nincrease the land available for highways, housing or agriculture will lower the water table and make the remaining\nwetlands more susceptible to drought and fire. Extensive development in Florida, for example, has changed the flow\nof water through the Everglades, threatening the future of what was once the seemingly endless wetlands of southern\nFlorida. More rapid runoff of water means that both floods and droughts are more likely, which means that certain\nspecies of plants and animals will have greater difficulty surviving.\nFragmentation of an ecosystem will eventually create areas that are too small to support the wildlife that formerly\nflourished there. A black bear requires a range of 10 to 100 square miles; if a region that formerly supported large\npopulations of black bears is crisscrossed by roads and disrupted by housing developments and malls, then the habitat\nwill no longer be large enough for the bears to survive.\nFor species requiring less extensive ranges, it is not so much the fragmentation of the habitat as the total loss of habitat\nthat will be decisive. As agricultural land is turned into housing developments or malls, the birds that used to feed on\nthe insects and seeds will have to go somewhere else, and the deer that used to feed on the leftover corn cobs will be\nhit by cars as they try to feed on the shrubs and gardens of the new developments. Colonies of butterflies and\ndragonflies will be lost, along with vast numbers of mice, voles, and moles and the hawks, owls, and weasels that feed\non them. For migratory birds, the loss of habitat is especially problematical, as they need places to feed and to breed,\nperhaps on two continents, and they need extensive areas for resting and feeding along their migration routes.\nA final threat to ecosystems comes from the introduction of alien species. In a well-functioning ecosystem, everything\nis in balance. Insects or other animals eat some but not all of the seeds, none of the animals eat all of any of the species\nof plants, and none of the plants grows so rapidly that it crowds out all of the other plants: it is a complex system of\nnatural checks and balances. An alien species is one that originated in a distant ecosystem where it had adapted to\ncompetition with the other plants and animals that comprised that ecosystem. It undoubtedly served to control some\nof the other species, and other species controlled it. However, when introduced as an alien into a new ecosystem,\nthere may be no controls and balances, and an alien species may prosper to the extent that it out-competes and\neventually crowds out the native species. Purple loosestrife is a tall, tough wildflower that has a large woody ball of\nroots; it has numerous flowers on a spike, and it grows profusely in wetlands. When introduced to wetlands in the\nUnited States, it faces only modest competition from less aggressive plants, and it has no natural insect competitors.\nAs a result, it can, within a few years, fill the wetlands, creating what is a beautiful purple covering but what is also a\nbarren wetland. As there are no native insects that eat the stalks or the flowers, there are no native birds that are\nattracted to the plant, and there are no hawks circling to catch any of those birds off-guard. The weeds grow so close\ntogether that it is difficult or impossible for muskrats or beavers to keep their channels open, and there is too little\nspace between plants to support families of ducks.\n\nAlien species often get their start when ground is disturbed for some sort of construction project. If these species are\nnot dealt with - which often requires people who search for the first aliens and then pull them out by hand - then they\ncan rapidly spread and destroy many acres of land. The key point to remember is these alien species overflow their\nniche, eliminating the chance for native species to prosper, and also eliminating the niche that was occupied by insects\nand animals that depended upon the native plants and animals. Alien species may be beautiful, but they tend to limit\nbiodiversity.\nMaintaining the health of ecosystems requires local, regional, and national strategies. One useful concept is Green\nInfrastructure, which refers to the network of natural areas that is necessary to support the diverse populations of\nnative plants and animals that live within a region. This term does not refer to man-made infrastructure that is\nconstructed in an environmentally friendly manner. Rather, it refers to the connected natural system of open spaces,\nforests, waterways, and wetlands that allows plant and animal species to prosper. Green infrastructure includes the\nfollowing kinds of components:\n-\nVery large areas of undeveloped land that are able to support and protect habitat for the widest-ranging\nanimals and ensure the continued existence of diverse ecosystems\n-\nSmall areas of undeveloped land that protect uncommon or rare ecosystems\n-\nNumerous small or medium-sized natural areas that are large enough and close enough together to avoid\nisolation of plant and animal species\n-\nConnecting corridors of open spaces that can be used by animals to move between the larger open areas\nBy acknowledging the existence of and the need for green infrastructure, it is possible for government agencies and\nconservation groups to develop plans that preserve and protect suitable green infrastructure. National parks, state\nparks, public conservation lands (e.g. national forests or wildlife management areas) can provide the critical large\nareas. Smaller parks, wetlands, and private land-holdings can protect enough smaller areas to ensure diversity and\ndensity of ecosystems. The hardest part is ensuring that wide enough corridors are maintained between and among\nall of the open spaces so that wildlife can in fact move throughout the region. The corridors need to be wide enough\nto be perceived as safe routes for animals to travel. For the largest mammals, 100 to 200 foot-side corridors will be\nneeded. For smaller mammals and amphibians, narrower corridors will suffice. Land adjacent to waterways and\nwetlands is ideal for use as connecting corridors, as is land next to railroads, power lines, or other infrastructure\nnetworks.\nPollution can be controlled by limiting emissions, by confining emissions, or by cleaning up emissions. The cheapest\ncontrol strategy is to prevent emissions, but that may or may not be feasible depending upon the nature of the process\nthat causes the pollution. Some pollutants are extremely toxic, and even a small release can be hazardous to anyone\nliving close to where the release occurs. Hence, special consideration is necessary in dealing with the most toxic\nchemicals and spent nuclear fuels or other radioactive substances. Finding a safe means of sequestering nuclear waste\nis one of the main challenges facing the nuclear power industry.\nClimate change caused by excessive emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other so-called greenhouse gases is\na major challenge for the world in the 21st century. Scientists believe that increasing concentrations of these gases in\nthe atmosphere will trap heat, thereby leading to warmer temperatures. With warmer temperatures, there will be more\nenergy available to power hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis and other extreme weather conditions.\nWarmer\ntemperatures will also accelerate the melting of glaciers and the ice caps, which will raise the level of the oceans and\nthreaten flooding of the many cities and developed regions along the coasts. Changes in climate could also include\nregional changes in precipitation, which could have major implications for agriculture and for the natural environment.\nEnvironmental Impacts of Projects\nProposals for major infrastructure projects can raise many different kinds of environmental issues. Abutters,\npoliticians, environmental organizations and others are likely to express concerns about some or all of the following:\n\na.\nUse of materials in construction and operation\nb. Pollution: impacts on air quality, water quality, and soil toxicity\nc.\nLoss of habitat and disruption of ecosystems: Impacts on plants and wildlife\nd. Impacts on the local environment (noise, shade, aesthetics)\ne.\nSustainability or the lack thereof\nIt will not be possible or necessary to consider all possible levels of impacts for every project that is considered.\nRegulations can be developed that govern the use of materials and that establish acceptable limits for pollution.\nRegional plans can help identify the necessary green infrastructure, and zoning can be used to direct development\naway from the most critical natural areas. Local impacts on noise, aesthetics, and land use will of course be a concern\nfor nearly any project, and some sort of community involvement can be helpful in anticipating and responding to\npotential problems.\nIn the United States, a process has been created to ensure that environmental impacts are considered along with the\neconomic and social impacts of any major project or program involving federal funding or approvals. This process\nemphasizes the need for determining and disclosing environmental impacts in what is called an environmental impact\nstatement (EIS), and it requires developers to consider how to mitigate negative impacts, but it does not indicate what\ncan or cannot be done. That determination is left to the legislatures and the courts. An EIS is required for any major\nfederal legislation or action \"significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\"1 The federal agency\nproposing the changes must prepare the EIS, which must include \"a detailed statement of these environmental effects.\"\n\"The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., Public Law\n91-190, 83 Stat. 852), requires that all Federal agencies proposing legislation and other major actions\nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment consult with other agencies having jurisdiction\nby law or special expertise over such environmental considerations, and thereafter prepare a detailed\nstatement of these environmental effects. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has published\nregulations and associated guidance to implement NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508).\"2\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for reviewing the draft EIS and rating it according to two\ncriteria. First, the EPA must decide whether or not the EIS is acceptable in terms of the depth of its analysis and the\ncompleteness of its findings. Second, EPA rates the environmental impact according to one of four categories:\n-\nLack of objections (LO): \"The review has not identified any potential environmental impacts requiring\nsubstantive changes to the preferred alternative. The review may have disclosed opportunities for application\nof mitigation measures that could be accomplished with no more than minor changes to the proposed action.\"\n-\nEnvironmental Concerns (EC): \"The review has identified environmental impacts that should be avoided in\norder to fully protect the environment. Corrective measures may require changes to the preferred alternative\nor application of mitigation measures that can reduce the environmental impact.\"\n-\nEnvironmental Objections (EO): \"The review has identified significant environmental impacts that should\nbe avoided in order to adequately protect the environment. Corrective measures may require substantial\nchanges to the preferred alternative or consideration of some other project alternative (including the no action\nalternative or a new alternative).\"\n-\nEnvironmentally Unsatisfactory (EU). \"The review has identified adverse environmental impacts that are of\nsufficient magnitude that EPA believes the proposed action must not proceed as proposed.\"\n1 The material in this sub-section is based upon EPA's \"Policy and Procedures for the Review of Federal Actions Impacting the\nEnvironment\" October 3, 1984, pp. 4, 19-20. The document is available from EPA's web site (www.epa.gov)\n2 Ibid. p. 4\n\nThe EPA review is a major hurdle for any project involving the federal government or requiring federal approval.\nAfter a draft EIS is published, time is allowed for public comments concerning what the draft includes or fails to\ninclude. The draft EIS and all of the comments and procedural rulings are available to the public on-line. If the EPA\nfinds environmental concerns, it may require substantial changes in the proposed actions or prevent the project from\nproceeding as proposed. Moreover, if EPA finds the EIS to be inadequate, EPA may require it to be revised or redone,\nan action that could delay a project for a year or more.\nThe conditions that would allow the EPA to raise environmental objections are specified by government regulations.\nObjections can be raised in five situations:\n1. \"Where an action might violate or be inconsistent with achievement or maintenance of a national\nenvironmental standard;\n2. \"Where the Federal agency violates its own substantive environmental requirements that relate to EPA's\nareas of jurisdiction or expertise;\n3. \"Where there is a violation of an EPA policy declaration;\n4. \"Where there are no applicable standards or where applicable standards will not be violated but there is\npotential for significant environmental degradation that could be corrected by project modification or other\nfeasible alternatives; or\n5. \"Where proceeding with the proposed action would set a precedent for future actions that collectively could\nresult in significant environmental impacts.\"\nIn other words, EPA must have a clear reason for raising objections, and other guidelines and policies will be used to\ndetermine whether proposed actions are acceptable or not. More stringent guidelines are in place for finding a proposal\nwith environmental objections to be environmentally unsatisfactory:\n1. \"The potential violation of or inconsistency with a national environmental standard is substantive and/or\nwill occur on a long-term basis;\n2. \"There are no applicable standards but the severity, duration, or geographical scope of the impacts\nassociated with the proposed action warrant special attention; or\n3. \"The potential environmental impacts resulting from the proposed action are of national importance because\nof the threat to national environmental resources or to environmental policies.\"\nThus, the environmental review process places the onus on the proposing agency to identify the potential impacts,\nwhile establishing an agency with the necessary skills and responsibility to review and interpret the EIS. The criteria\ncited above could be quite qualitative, leaving approval up to the judgment of the EPA. Since the whole process is\nopen to the public, it is possible for groups opposed to any action to make their objections to EPA.\nFigure 1 summarizes the review process used by EPA. If a major project or action is proposed, the first step is to\ndetermine whether or not there will be significant impact on the environment. If EPA believes that there will be no\nsuch impact, then it can allow the project to proceed without an EIS. If EPA finds that there will be significant impact\non the environment, then the proponents of the project must prepare a draft EIS, which will be available for public\ncomment and review by EPA prior to submission of the final EIS. EPA will then make its decision, as described\nabove. If EPA finds that the environmental impact is unknown, then an initial environmental assessment can be\nrequired, which could lead to a finding of no significant impact or to the preparation, review, and revision of an EIS.\nA great deal of judgment is involved in preparing and reviewing environmental impact statements. EPA has developed\ntwo sets of checklists of questions that might be asked in order to guide reviewers as they evaluate an EIS.3 The first\nset of checklists address general areas of environmental concern that might apply to any proposed project: energy\nmanagement, habitat preservation, landscaping, water use, and pest management. In each area, EPA has summarized\n3 Science Applications International Corporation, \"Pollution Prevention - Environmental Impact Reduction Checklists for\nNEPA/309 Reviewers\", Final Report, EPA Contract No. 68-W2-0026, January 1995\n\nthe relevant scientific factors and posed a series of questions that could and probably should be asked when reviewing\nany project. The second checklist provides questions that address the problems likely to be encountered in different\ntypes of projects. In each special area, such as a transportation or waterway project, the guidebook includes a brief\nsummary of the likely problems and then provides several dozen questions that could be asked to determine how well\nan EIS has addressed issues that might be anticipated.\nFigure 1 Summary of NEPA Decision Process\nProposed Action\nAre Impacts\nSignificant?\nYes\nConduct\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\nNo\nUnknown\nDraft EIS\nNotice\nof Intent\nDecision\nMemo\nPublic\nComment\nPublic\nComment\nFinal EIS\nRecord of\nDecision\nAre Impacts\nSignificant?\nYes or Maybe:\nSubmit EIS\nNo: Finding of\nNo Significant\nImpact\nCategorical Exclusion:\nNo EIS Necessary\nSocial Impacts\nAlmost any project will have social impacts that may be related to the users of the project, people who live near the\nproject, people who are displaced or competitively disadvantaged because of the project, or people who are hurt or\nwhose lives are hindered as a result of the construction or operation of the project. Social impacts could be positive\nas well as negative, but it is the negative impacts that must be considered most carefully. Positive social impacts will\nhelp make a project more attractive, whereas negative impacts may be sufficient to arouse intense public opposition\nthat prevents or markedly restricts a project. Anticipating negative impacts is therefore something that should be done\nearly in the evaluation process, so that there will be an opportunity to adjust plans so as to reduce the negative impacts\nor to provide means for mitigating them.\nMajor projects may have far-reaching consequences that are difficult or impossible to quantify or comprehend. In\nsome cases, projects that appear at first to be wholly desirable turn out to have unexpected consequences that are\nviewed very unfavorably by some people. In their famous study of Middletown, Robert and Helen Lynd reported that\nsome residents recognized the social benefits of having automobiles for commuting, but were outrage by the dreadful\nsocial impacts of auto ownership:\n\n\"No one questions the use of the auto for transporting groceries, getting to one's place of work or to the golf\ncourse, or in place of the porch for \"cooling off after supper\" on a hot summer evening; however much the\nactivities concerned with getting a living may be altered by the fact that a factory can draw from workmen\nwithin a radius of forty-five miles, or however much old labor union men resent the intrusion of this new\nalternate way of spending an evening, these things are hardly major issues. But when auto riding tends to\nreplace the traditional call in the family parlor as a way of approach between the unmarried, \"the home is\nendangered\", and all-day Sunday motor trips are a \"threat against the church;\" it is in the activities\nconcerned with the home and religion that the automobile occasions the greatest emotional conflicts.\"4\nIn the United States, social impacts must be considered as part of the process required for environmental impact\nassessment. A set of principles and guidelines for social impact assessment was developed by the Interorganizational\nCommittee on Principles and Guidelines for Social Impact Assessment (ICPGSIA), a group of social scientists who\nsought to help public agencies and private organizations in carrying out responsible social impact assessment (SIA).\nTheir motivation was that \"SIAs help the affected community or communities and the agencies plan for social change\nresulting from a proposed action or bring forward information leading to the reasons not to carry out the proposal.\"5\nLike the environmental impact assessment, a major purpose for the SIA is to provide a mechanism for understanding\nand responding to the potential negative impacts of proposed policies, programs or projects.\nBy social impacts, we mean the consequences to human populations of any public or private actions\nthat alter the ways in which people live, work, play, relate to one another, organize to meet their needs\nand generally cope as members of society. The term also includes cultural impacts involving changes\nto the norms, values, and beliefs that guide and rationalize their cognition of themselves and their\nsociety.\nThe Interorganizational Committee on Principles\nand Guidelines for Social Impact Assessment\nThis group defined social impacts and identified six principles for social impact assessment. The first principle calls\nfor identifying the people who will be affected by the proposed action and collecting information about their social\nconditions so as to establish a base line for evaluating changes to those conditions. The second principle is that the\nanalysis should be focused on the most important social and cultural issues that are likely to be affected. The SIA\nneed not address every possible social or cultural impact that might be imagined. The third principle emphasizes the\nneed for using proper methods and input from the public in identifying and quantifying problems that might be\nencountered. In other words, social scientists know how to do this kind of analysis, and they should be involved early\nin the design and evaluation process for major projects. The fourth principle establishes the role of the SIA as\nproviding information to be used by decision makers and the public; the SIA and the people conducting the SIA are\nnot the ones who ultimately make decisions about whether or not to go ahead with the project.\nThe fifth principle deals with environmental justice, which refers to the sometimes commonly used approach to\nlocating or structuring projects: \"locate them in the poorest neighborhoods and don't worry about how the\ndisadvantaged will be hurt by the project.\" Who benefits and who pays are important considerations in SIA and in\nproject evaluation in general. The final principal indicates that SIA doesn't end when the project or program or policy\nis implemented. It is necessary to monitor what happens to ensure that mitigation measures are actually implemented\nand to ensure that unforeseen social impacts will be recognized.\n4 Robert S. and Helen Merrell Lynd, Middletown: A study in Contemporary American Culture, New York, 1929 [the authors spent\nmore than a year in Muncie, Indiana, interviewing residents about all facets of life in that small city].\n5 The Interorganizational Committee on Principles and Guidelines for Social Impact Assessment, \"Principles and guidelines for\nsocial impact assessment in the USA\", Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal, Vol. 21 No. 3, Beech Tree Publishing,\nGuilford, Surrey, UK, September 2003\n\nPredicted social impacts may be temporary or long-lived, and there may be minor impacts that affect a lot of people\nor intense impacts for a few people. To understand the importance of social impacts, it will help to consider the kinds\nof social impacts that might be encountered in typical infrastructure projects. Table 2 lists some of the notable types\nof impacts.\nTable 2 Examples of Negative Social Impacts of Projects\nType of Impact\nExamples\nRelocation of people\n-\nEntire villages displaced for the construction of a dam.\n-\nHundreds of people and small businesses relocated to allow the construction of\na highway through a city.\nDeaths and injury during\n-\nDeaths of more than 20,000 from tropical disease in the various efforts that\nconstruction\neventually led to the Panama Canal.\n-\nDeaths resulting from workers falling off bridges or buildings in situations\nwhere safety nets were not installed.\nDeaths, injury or illnesses\n-\nMillions of people severely injured or killed in highway accidents\nresulting during normal\n-\nBridges and tall buildings serving as jump-off points for suicides\noperation of infrastructure\n-\nAsthma and other illnesses resulting from air pollution caused by emissions from\npower plants, automobiles, or home heating\n-\nTens of thousands of people injured or killed annually worldwide in grade\ncrossing accidents between highway vehicles and trains\nDeaths and injuries\nresulting from\ninfrastructure failure\n-\nThousands of deaths and destruction of cities resulting from dam failures.\n-\nLoss of life from buildings and structures that collapse in earthquakes\nDisruption of\n-\nLimited access highways serving as barriers when they are constructed so as to\nneighborhoods\ndivide urban neighborhoods.\n-\nLoss of property values following construction of large, noisy, or ugly buildings\nor infrastructure.\n-\nCreation of suburbs and decline of central cities following construction of better\nhighways and policies that encouraged home ownership.\nLoss of livelihood caused\n-\nDestruction of fishing and shell-fishing areas following construction of bridges,\nby negative environmental\nport facilities, or oil spills\naspects of a project\n-\nDecline in use of informal taxis and buses following opening of new subway\nlines in large cities in Latin America and Asia.\nLoss of livelihood related\n-\nBankruptcy of canal companies following construction of railroads.\nto projects that help\n-\nBankruptcy of railroads following construction of highways and invention of\ncompetitors\ncars, trucks and airplanes.\n-\nDecline in newspapers following widespread use of the internet.\nLoss of privacy\n-\nDisruption of the life of native peoples following construction of roads or\nrailroads through their previously remote homelands.\nReduced quality of life\n-\nNoise and dust resulting from construction of a highway\n-\nShade resulting from construction of tall buildings\nIt might be even more helpful to consider some projects where the social impacts, whether foreseen or unforeseen,\nturned out to be devastating or reprehensible. If the leaders of the French company that set out to build the Panama\nCanal knew that tens of thousands would die in their failed attempt, would they have ever begun the project? If city\nofficials in New Orleans had long ago understood the risks posed by hurricanes, would they have allowed housing to\nbe built in the lowest-lying areas of the city? If automobile manufacturers, highway engineers, and government\nofficials truly understood the dangers of automobiles (hundreds of thousands killed worldwide each year), would we\nhave the system that we have today? These questions are worth some discussion. Hindsight may suggest that we\n\nwould have done things differently if we had only known - but maybe the drive for a route to the Pacific, the need for\nmore housing, and our great love affair with the automobile would have led us exactly to where we ended up.\nVarious researchers and agencies have used different categories of social impacts, and it is possible to construct quite\nelaborate topologies of social impacts. Whatever the categories, the main concern for the SIA will be to determine\nwho is going to be hurt by the project or program, when will problems arise, and what can be done about them. As\nwith environmental impact assessment, it is believed that there is much to be gained simply requiring these questions\nto be asked, with the answers and supporting information made public. If the problem is understood, then it may be\npossible to take action.\nThere broad categories of actions can be identified\n-\nAdjust the design so as to avoid or reduce the social impacts\n-\nRequire mitigation as a condition for approval of the project\n-\nCompensate those who are hurt by the project.\nWhether or not any or all of these are necessary is something that will ultimately be decided by those who are\nthreatened, local governments, developers, other stakeholders, and the courts.\nSafety and Security\nSafety and security are particularly important and emotional social concerns. Public reactions to projects seldom\nderive from a calm, rational assessment of the costs and benefits. Sometimes the public response is driven by fears\nand emotions, whether the fears relate to the potential for disaster or for national security. Proponents are likely to\ndownplay the potential problems, while opponents are likely to stir up people's emotions. The classic case is nuclear\npower. While there have been only a very few serious accidents involving nuclear power plants in the U.S., the public\nhas been very fearful of such accidents and very leery of proposals for sequestering nuclear waste. If nuclear power\nplants are built to modern safety standards, and if radioactive waste is properly sequestered, then they would seem to\nprovide an efficient, clean alternative to the use of fossil fuels for generating electricity. However, public fears have\nforced extraordinary measures to be taken to limit the risks of such plants, and some countries have banned such plants\naltogether.\nIn the United States, a rather inconsequential incident at the Three-Mile Island Power Plant in 1979 was \"the most\nserious in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant operating history, even though it led to no deaths or injuries to plant\nworkers or members of the nearby community.\"6 The accident led to very little off-site release of radiation. The\naverage dose (1 millirem) of radiation to the population of 2 million closest to the site was only one-sixth of the dose\nreceived during a full set of chest x-rays. In addition, the NRC reports that studies have determined that there were\nno more than negligible effects on the environment. However, the accident at Three Mile Island led to sweeping\nchanges in the regulation of the nuclear industry, including the addition of many costly safety procedures. The\nnegative media attention that it received also created a terrible public image for the nuclear power industry as a whole,\nand no new plants were built in the US for 30 years. Acceptance of nuclear power varied widely in other countries.\nIn Germany, public opposition led to a political decision in 2003 to phase-out of nuclear power plants, but in France,\nnuclear power had by then become the dominant source of electrical power.7\n6 Fact Sheet on the Accident at Three Mile Island. 1 Mar. 2004. United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 10 Nov. 2004. <\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html>\n7 Stephen Graham, \"Germany begins nuclear phaseout,\" The Boston Globe, November 15, 2003\n\nSummary and Discussion\nThe public sector's perspective regarding projects differs in several important ways from that of the private sector.\nEntrepreneurs view projects as a means of making their fortune; investors view projects as a way to earn a return on\ntheir investment; public officials and charitable organizations view projects as a way to achieve goals related to\nsociety's needs or desires. Many of the differences can be captured by the distinctions between financial analysis and\neconomic analysis. Financial analysis addresses cash flows, whereas economic analysis also considers safety and\nsecurity, growth in the economy, and provision of education, infrastructure, and other public services.\nAnother difference between the public and private perspective is that environmental and social concerns are more\nlikely to motivate public projects, whereas such concerns are apt to be constraints on private projects. This is not an\nabsolute difference. In particular, many infrastructure projects may have very negative consequences on the\nenvironment or upon people who live near project or who must move to accommodate the projects. Construction of\nroads through cities, creation of dams that displace thousands of people, irrigation projects that require flooding of\nfertile valleys, and use of public land for forestry and mining are examples of public efforts that can lead to serious\ncontroversy among agencies and among those who favor or oppose the projects. When controversies arise about\npublic projects, a change in government, legal battles, or the passage of new legislation may be needed to resolve the\nissues. When controversies arise with respect to the social or environmental impacts of private projects, there could\nbe legal and legislative battles to determine what kinds of activities are allowed and what kinds are prohibited.\nA principle underlying public projects is that the benefits should exceed the costs. The project itself does not have to\nproduce the cash necessary to cover the investment or even the operating costs, as the government has the power to\nraise taxes to pay for projects. However, the project should provide measurable economic benefits that are at least as\ngreat as all of the economic costs of the project. Just as the benefits can be more than the cash flow directly related to\nthe projects, the costs can include social, economic and environmental impacts that are directly or indirectly related\nto the project. The logic underlying benefit/cost analysis can easily be misinterpreted. The proper interpretation of\nthis kind of analysis is that the government should not pursue projects if the expected benefits are less than the expected\ncosts. This does not mean that projects where benefits exceed costs should be approved, it only means that they\ndeserve further consideration. Many controversies about the need for projects boil down to controversies as to what\ncounts as a benefit, what counts as a cost, and how values should be put on factors such as safety, air quality, or job\ncreation.\nThe extent to which concerns about environmental impacts, social impacts, or safety should affect the design or\nimplementation of a project is something that will ultimately be decided by governments, developers, other\nstakeholders, and the courts. Over time, as the validity and magnitude of such concerns become clearer, it may be\ndesirable or necessary to require improvements to existing infrastructure and develop more stringent regulations for\nlocating, designing, and constructing new projects.\nThis essay has addressed the key factors that must be considered in enhancing the sustainability of infrastructure\nsystems: financial feasibility, economic impact, environmental impact, and social impacts including safety and\nsecurity. Finances are important, because cash will be needed to construct, maintain and operate infrastructure.\nEconomic impacts are important, because they include many types of short- and long-term impacts that can help to\njustify a good project or to prevent a bad project. Environmental impacts are important, because an infrastructure-\nsystem that is too destructive to the environment or that requires excessive use of limited natural resources will not\nlong endure. Social impacts are important, because it is ultimately society that decides whether or not to proceed with\ninfrastructure projects and that bears the brunt of failures to consider hidden costs of projects.\nIt is clear that there are many diverse factors that will influence what needs are addressed, what projects are considered,\nand how projects will be evaluated. There will be no easy methods for determining the best projects, and no simple\nways to gain public support for a particular project, although various methods and concepts can be used in reaching a\nconsensus about what is needed and what should be done.\n\nComparing Strategies for Improving System Performance\n\"The basic idea is to define alternatives to just sufficient a level of detail to allow\ndifferent stakeholders to at least rank order them in terms of desirability according to\neach identified criterion.\"\nTheodor J. Stewart, \"Thirsting for Consensus\"\nIntroduction\nAny major project is likely to have multiple objectives and measures of performance, especially but not only when\npublic agencies are involved.\nComparing strategies for improving system performance may at times be a\nstraightforward matter of comparing financial costs and benefits, but it will be much more likely that important factors\nwill be difficult or impossible to express in monetary terms. That is why project evaluation often focuses on cost\neffectiveness and why weighting schemes are commonly used when evaluating competing options.\nThe benefit of stating all costs and benefits in monetary terms is obvious: the methods used to compare financial costs\nand benefits can then be used to compare all of the economic costs and benefits. The danger of trying to state all\ncosts and benefits in monetary terms is that the evaluation may simply disregard important measures that cannot be\nconverted into monetary measures. The fact that it is difficult to put a price tag on beauty or equity is no reason to\nignore aesthetics or to forget about being fair.\nDiscounting and Net Present Values\nFor some projects, it is possible to translate costs and benefits into monetary terms. At times, the translation can be\nstraightforward, as when measuring changes in congestion by using the average values of time for the automobiles\nand trucks that are stuck in traffic. Other factors, such as safety, may require potentially controversial assumptions,\ne.g. the value to society of avoiding or incurring injuries or fatalities. Still others, such as aesthetics, can only with\ngreat difficulty be given a monetary value. Economists and other researchers have been very creative in developing\nmethods of estimating the value of changes in measures that at first glance appear to be purely qualitative. For\nexample, it is possible to link air quality to health and also to more mundane matters such as the need for window-\nwashing and periodic cleaning of buildings.\nEven if we can state the most important types of costs and benefits in monetary terms, we still have a problem in\ncomparing options, since costs and benefits of an infrastructure project are likely to be spread across a period of many\nyears or decades. The basic question is whether or not the expected future benefits will be sufficient to justify the\ninitial investment. To answer this question, it is necessary to compare current and future costs and benefits. For any\ncost or benefit that can be monetarized, a process known as discounting can be used. Discounting provides a means\nof reducing future costs or benefits so that they can be expressed as equivalent present values that will be directly\ncomparable to current costs and benefits. Discounting is used in both the public and the private sectors, with the\npublic sector considering broad categories of costs and benefits and the private sector concentrating on cash flows. .\nDiscounting is necessary because money in the future is worth less than it is today or, to say the same thing in different\nterms, money today can be invested and grow into a larger sum in the future. The basic relationship between present\nand future value is a function of the discount rate r and the time period t:\n(Eq. 1)\nPresent value = Future Value/(1+r)t\nBy use of this equation, future costs or benefits can be discounted to be equivalent to a current cost or benefit. For\nexample, if an expected benefit of $1 million in year 4 were discounted at a rate of 5% per year, it would be worth\n\nonly $822,000 today. The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of a future sum of money. The same\n$1 million in year 4 would be worth less than $700 thousand today if it were discounted at 10%.\nThe net present value (NPV) of a project is the sum of the discounted values of all the benefits and costs associated\nwith the project. If the NPV is positive, then the benefits outweigh the costs; if the NPV is negative, then the costs\noutweigh the benefits. Maximizing NPV may be viewed as the primary objective of a project, particularly in the\nprivate sector. In the public sector, this objective corresponds to maximizing the overall net benefits to society, taking\ninto account any and all costs and benefits that can be expressed in terms of dollars and cents. If only financial costs\nare considered, as would commonly be the case in the private sector, then this objective would be stated as \"maximize\nthe net present value of cash flows\".\nThe choice of a discount rate is an important factor in project evaluation. A very high discount rate will emphasize\ninitial costs and make it more difficult to justify projects that require large investments; a very low discount rate will\nfavor projects that have net benefits that continue over a very long time horizon. Private companies typically use a\ndiscount rate of 10% or greater in evaluating their projects; higher rates are used if projects are perceived to be riskier.\nPublic agencies, which do not have to pay taxes, will typically use a lower discount rate. Discount rates will rise with\ninflation in both the private and public sectors.\nThis section has only introduced the most basic concepts of discounting and NPV, but even these basic concepts are\nvery powerful. If we are given costs and benefits that occur over any stretch of time, and if we have a discount rate,\nwe now know how to calculate the NPV of these benefits.\nMeasuring Cost effectiveness\nIt is always possible to calculate the cost effectiveness of any investment with respect to any non-financial, but\nquantifiable objective. Cost effectiveness is the ratio of the investment cost to the improvement in the measurement\nof interest, i.e. the $ per unit improvement. If different options are compared, the most cost effective option will have\nthe lowest cost per unit of improvement.\nConsider the case shown in Table 1, where there are three alternatives for reducing the impact of highway noise on\nthe residents of two new apartment buildings that will be built adjacent to a heavily traveled interstate highway. The\nfirst option is to erect a quarter-mile long sound barrier along the edge of the property that abuts the highway. The\nsecond option is to require special sound-proofing for all of the windows and walls that face the highway. The third\noption is to design floor plans to minimize the windows on the walls facing the highway, e.g. by placing bathrooms,\nclosets, and stairways along that wall. The effectiveness of each measure is estimated in terms of the average reduction\nin noise levels that would be experienced by residents living in the structure. In this hypothetical example, the three\nstrategies result in a similar reduction in noise levels, and redesigning the floor space is the most cost-effective way\nto gain peace and quiet.\nTable 1 Cost Effectiveness of Three Options for Reducing Noise Levels\nOption\nCost\nReduction in Noise\nLevels\nCost-Effectiveness\n($/% improvement)\nNoise barrier\n$500,000\n20%\n$25 thousand\nSound-proofing\n$200,000\n22%\n$9.1 thousand\nRedesign floor space\n$100,000\n21%\n$4.8 thousand\nUsing Weighting Schemes in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making\nAny major project, but especially public projects, will be trying to satisfy multiple objectives, many of which will be\nnon-financial. There are likely to be many competing designs, some of which are markedly different in approach.\nEach of these projects can be evaluated in terms of each of the objectives, producing a (very large) matrix showing\n\nthe predicted impacts of each option on each of the objectives. It is very unlikely that any option will be rated best\non all measures; instead, one design will be the cheapest, another will have the highest capacity, another will have the\nleast impact on the environment, and another will be the easiest to construct. Which alternative is the best is dependent\nupon how much weight is placed on each objective.\nChoosing the best project will therefore ultimately require making judgments concerning the relative importance of\nthe various objectives and the validity and uncertainty of the evaluation process. Unless there is a single individual\nwith authority to make all design decisions, selecting the best project will inherently be a political process: people\nwith different perspectives and agendas will have to work out a process to determine the best way to proceed.\nThere are many methods that can be used to help structure the political process. Weighting schemes can be developed\nand applied to each of the criteria. However, weighting schemes may appear to be more objective than they really\nare. This is not an argument against using weights, and it is certainly not an argument against having multiple criteria.\nHowever, it is a caution to avoid thinking that it will be easy to agree upon criteria or weights or to think that the\npublic will agree with whatever criteria or weights are proposed by any of the parties.\nChoosing weights is simply another way of making judgments. In situations where there is general agreement\nconcerning a) the options to be considered, b) the relevant criteria, and c) the relative importance of the criteria, a\nstructured weighting scheme can be helpful in ranking the options. However, weighting schemes will not be of much\nuse if there is strong disagreement about which alternatives should be considered, which criteria are most important,\nand how impacts should be measured. Presenting a weighting scheme as a way to obtain an \"objective ranking of the\noptions\" will, in such cases, be impossible, as the different groups will simply push for weights that favor their own\npreferred options. Difficulties in reaching consensus will be exacerbated if many of the criteria are highly qualitative.\nThe role of the analyst is clear: provide the best information possible within the available time and budget; identify\nwhat is certain, what is likely, and what is possible. Let people know how much faith you put in each part of the\nanalysis. Explain the assumptions, and indicate whether or not you or your expert colleagues believe such assumptions\nto be reasonable. Where have you had to make guesses, say where those guesses are most uncertain. You also want\nto make sure that the range of options is wide enough to cover the major strategies that might be considered. Finally,\nin public meetings or in private meetings with stakeholders, you can try to ensure that the discussion deals with the\nactual data and credible options, and you can try to provide insight as to the cost-effectiveness of various proposals\nwith respect to various criteria.\nSeeking Public Input\nInput from the public and key stakeholders can be helpful in identifying how to look at a complex problem. Input will\nbe most helpful - and the exercise is likely to be most productive - at a point in time when there is general awareness\nthat something needs to be done about a problem, but no one knows (or thinks they know) what is best to do. The\nmain reasons for seeking input from the public and from stakeholders are to clarify the nature of the problem, to\nidentify potential alternatives or strategies for dealing with the problem, and to discuss the relevant criteria for\nselecting and evaluating specific alternatives. Preliminary discussions can also be very useful in identifying where\nthere is consensus about needs and opportunities, where additional information is needed, and where potential\ncontroversy will be most likely. This feedback will be helpful in allocating research and planning resources and in\ndetermining how best to structure the process.\nFor example, many projects are aimed at promoting development while at the same time improving living conditions\nfor people living in a region and protecting the environment. Different groups of people would likely place much\ndifferent weights on the costs and benefits related to such things as regional development, median income for residents,\npollution, and loss of open space. Possible types of projects might include investments in new infrastructure,\nupgrading technology, providing regulatory incentives, increasing awareness of best practices, or changing\ngovernmental structure or policies. Input from citizens could help prioritize the problems and place weights on various\ncosts and measures, thereby providing a framework for seeking the most effective strategies. Consultants could\n\nconduct workshops on the issues and facilitate discussions among people representing a wide range of interests and\nexpertise. An informed examination of the needs, problems, and strategies for dealing with them may lead to\napproaches and projects that are less controversial, more responsive to the needs of the region, and better for the\nenvironment.\nSummary\nLarge projects will always be trying to meet multiple, sometimes conflicting objectives. Sometimes there will be\nobvious ways to define economic or financial criteria that capture the essence of a project. More often, it will be\nnecessary to make assumptions concerning the monetary value that might be associated with some of the impacts of\na project. And there may be times when the problems and potential solutions are primarily concerned with factors\nsuch as aesthetics or equity that are inherently difficult to quantify.\nExpressing Costs and Benefits in Monetary Terms\nIf the most important objectives can be expressed in economic terms, then it will be possible to create a single monetary\nestimate of the costs and benefits associated with a project. Many private sector projects are primarily concerned with\nfinancial matters: if this project proceeds, will the revenues be sufficient to cover the investment and operating costs?\nMany public projects will be concerned with broader economic benefits, such as economic growth, job creation, and\naverage income. While these economic benefits are not necessarily readily tied to the project or to specific individuals,\nthey can certainly be expressed in monetary terms.\nComparing Present and Future Costs and Benefits\nWhen evaluating costs and benefits over the life of a project, it is necessary to discount future costs and benefits for\ncomparison with present costs and benefits. By using a discount rate, any future cost or benefit can be reduced to an\nequivalent present value. By summing all of the discounted costs and benefits, it is possible to obtain the net present\nvalue (NPV) of a project. If the NPV is positive, then the project provides net benefits and may be worth pursuing.\nCost Effectiveness\nCost-effectiveness is a very useful concept when dealing with criteria that are quantifiable but difficult to monetarize.\nCost-effectiveness is the ratio of the cost of a proposed project to the change in performance. So long as it is possible\nto quantify a key aspect of performance, such as risk or capacity or service quality, it should be possible to evaluate\nalternatives by considering their cost-effectiveness in improving this aspect of performance. Cost-effectiveness will\nbe less relevant in projects where there are multiple objectives, so that it is impossible to focus on just one critical\naspect of performance.\nWeighting Schemes for Projects with Multiple Criteria\nWhen there are multiple objectives, some of which cannot be monetarized, then the evaluation cannot focus on a single\nmetric. Instead, some kind of weighting scheme - whether objective or subjective - will have to be used to compare\nalternatives. If a decision is made by an individual or by the vote of a committee or by a referendum, then each person\ninvolved can make their own subjective judgment in determining their preferred option. Often there will be a\nstructured process for making the decision that requires participants to consider multiple options, to consider impacts\nupon various objectives, and to follow a specific procedure for ranking the options. If so, then some sort of a weighting\nscheme may be helpful. With a weighting scheme, it is possible to collapse any set of multiple measures into a single\nmeasure of effectiveness.\nIt is critical to remember that there is no objective way to determine the \"correct\" weighting scheme or even the\nselection of the \"proper\" criteria. The choices of what criteria to consider and how much weight to give to each one\ncould cause intense debate among those trying to address a problem or those trying to promote a particular project.\n\nUsing Public Input in Identifying and Evaluating Projects\nInput from the public and/or stakeholders can be helpful in identifying and evaluating projects. Public input can help\nin clarifying the nature of the needs or problem, as well as in identifying measures or criteria that can be used to define\nthe problem and to evaluate potential solutions. In some cases, very rough measures of potential impacts may be\nuseful in reaching consensus about what to do, how to do it, and when to begin.\n\nPublic Private Partnerships\nWell-structured and well-implemented PPPs offer the prospect of efficiency gains in the construction\nof infrastructure assets and the provision of infrastructure-based services and, therefore, also\nlower the government's costs in making these services available.1\nIntroduction\nPublic agencies, developers, companies, investors, and the general public have different perspectives on projects. The\npublic sector is much more focused on identifying and satisfying public needs, whereas the private sector is much\nmore concerned with achieving financial benefits. The public sector is led by elected officials who must justify their\nactions and decisions to voters, and these officials are involved in many aspects of society, from education to\nprovisions of parks to water resources and waste management. The division of labor in the private sector produces\nleaders who are much more sharply focused on specific problems or types of activities. Some are concerned with\nfinance, others with planning and design, and others with operations and management of specific types of\ninfrastructure or industries. The public sector has the ability to raise money from taxation and, at the national level,\nto adjust the supply of money and the availability of credit for financing projects. The private sector offers\nentrepreneurs a chance to get rich by designing, promoting, constructing and operating particular projects. Elaborate\nsystems have evolved that enable developers to obtain the funds necessary to build projects, and people or companies\nwho are willing to take risks have a chance to achieve great rewards. The public sector has the ability to guide\ndevelopment through tax policy, zoning, building codes, and provision of infrastructure. The public sector also has\nthe responsibility for public heath, public safety, and environmental protection. People who are successful in the\npublic sector have a chance to attain great influence over policy and development.\nThere are few if any projects that do not require some sort of cooperation between the public sector and the private\nsector. Even a small addition to your house or the construction of a dock for your boat will require a building permit\nand perhaps a wetlands permit, while construction of any large building will only be possible if the developer secures\nnumerous approvals from various government agencies related to the location, design, construction materials, and\nconstruction processes. Likewise, when a government agency sets out to build a school or a road, that agency will\ntypically employ private sector contractors and sub-contractors. These interactions between the public and private\nsector do not constitute a partnership. Building a house or a dock or an office building is clearly a private project,\neven though it must be sanctioned by government and follows rules and regulations specified by law. Likewise,\nbuilding a school or a road is clearly a public project; even though the work is actually done by the private sector, the\nproject is defined and funded by the public sector.\nFigure 1 summarizes what is needed to have a successful project in the private sector. First, the decision to proceed\nwill depend upon having a positive net present value (NPV) or an internal rate of return (IRR) that exceeds the\ncompany's hurdle rate for new investment. The project will then need to have regulatory approvals, which could\nrelate to zoning, environmental impact assessment, site management, building codes, and any other regulations that\nare mandated. If financing is available, and if the company has access to the resources and managerial expertise to\nmanage the project, it can proceed to implementation. But that is just the beginning. Whether or not the project is\nsuccessful depends at first upon the ability to complete the project as designed, within the specified budget, and on\nschedule. Once the project is completed, ultimate success will depend upon the way that it is utilized; in particular, it\nmust function safely and efficiently, and it must generate revenues that will eventually be sufficient to cover both\noperating and investment costs.\n1 Bernardin Akitoby, Richard Hemming, and Gard Schwartz, Public Investment and Public-Private Partnerships, International\nMonetary Fund, Washington D.C. 2007, p. 9\n\nFigure 1 Overview of the Private Sector's View of a Successful Project\nPrivate Sector\nDecision To Proceed\nwith a Project\nPositive NPV\nAvailability of\nFinancing\nAvailability of\nResources\nAbility to Manage\nthe Project\nRegulatory\nApprovals\nProject Success:\n- Completed per design\n- On-time, on-budget\n- Operates as expected\n- Demand as expected\n- Financially sustainable\nFigure 2 illustrates the broader perspective of a public agency. The first major difference is that the project can no\nlonger be considered merely as a financial effort. Instead, economic, environmental, and social impacts must be\nconsidered and incorporated within a benefit/cost analysis. If taxpayers are willing to support a project because of\neconomic or other benefits, then taxes can cover some of the costs and the project does not require a positive NPV.\nThe public sector will face similar regulations regarding land use and environmental impact assessment, but there is a\nmajor difference. Laws and regulations can be used to limit or restrict what either a private company or a public\nagency might do, but political actions can defeat proposed public projects. A private project must meet the regulations,\nbut a public project must also satisfy the elected officials and ultimately the public. The second major difference is\nthat the definition of success is much broader, because economic, social, and environmental factors will also be of\ndirect interest to a public agency. To sustain a project over the long term, especially if tax dollars are required to\nsupport operations, public officials and the public must be convinced that those tax dollars are worth spending.\nReasons for Considering a Public Private Partnership\nPublic/private partnerships arise when a public agency or agencies work with the private sector on a project to build,\nfinance, and/or operate a facility. The public and private sectors are partners because they share in the risks and\nrewards of the project, and they share in the design and ownership of the project.\nSome public/private partnerships arise in order to take advantage of the differing strengths of the two sectors. Table\n1 compares some of the strengths of the public and the private sector as related to the implementation of infrastructure\nprojects. Broadly speaking, the public sector must be more concerned with social, economic and environmental issues,\nwhile the private sector is more concerned with finance. The public sector has greater ability to identify public needs\nand to allocate funds to address those needs in a reasonably fair manner; the private sector can quickly respond to\nperceived needs, without worrying so much about what is fair or what is most important to society as a whole. The\npublic sector can raise money via taxes and the sale of low-interest bonds, and it has real powers related to land use.\nThe private sector can raise money from investors, and it can obtain very large sums for clearly profitable projects.\nThe comparisons could go on and on. Some people would add that the private sector is more efficient or more honest,\nbut there are certainly examples of very efficient and inefficient operations in both sectors, just as honesty, wisdom,\nfraud and foolishness can be found in both. The point is that the two sectors have different strengths and there are\nsome projects that will be better designed, constructed, and operated if the two sectors work together.\n\nFigure 2 Overview of the Public Sector's View of a Successful Project\nPublic Sector\nDecision To Proceed\nwith a Project\nPositive B/C\nAvailability of\nFinancing\nAvailability of\nResources\nAbility to Manage\nthe Project\nRegulatory\nApprovals\nProject Success:\n-\nCompleted per design\n-\nOn-time, on-budget\n-\nOperates as expected\n-\nDemand as expected\n-\nFinancially sustainable\n-\nEconomic benefits are in fact\nachieved\n-\nSocial and environmental\nimpacts as expected\n-\nWillingness of public to\ncontinue support via taxation\nFinancial Costs &\nBenefits\nEconomicCosts\n& Benefits\nEnvironmental & Social\nImpact Assessment\nTable 1 Complementary Strengths of Public and Private Sector\nArea\nPublic Sector Strengths\nPrivate Sector Strengths\nIdentifying\nsocietal needs\nPolitical process can establish priorities among\ncompeting needs\nPrivate firms can respond quickly to\nperceived opportunities\nDesign\nEstablishment of building codes and\nconstruction standards\nDevelopment of new techniques or\ndesigns\nConstruction\nA stable work force can be assembled for\ncontinuing needs, such as road maintenance\nNumerous companies exist or can be\ncreated for all types of construction\nFinance\nAccess to tax revenues and ability to issue\nbonds with low (possibly tax-free) interest\nrates; possible difficulties in raising fees to\nkeep pace with inflation\nAbility to raise capital for projects;\nrecognizing the level of risk involved;\ngreater freedom in raising fees to keep\npace with inflation\nPolitics\nPolitical approval may require more complete\nassessment of alternatives and a fairer\ndistribution of costs and benefits\nInsulation from politics may result in\nmore objective assessment of projects\nLand Use\nAble to assemble large tracts of land for public\npurposes using eminent domain\nOwners can use their land any way they\nlike, so long as zoning and other\nregulations are followed\nLabor\nMay be required to use local labor or union\nlabor, resulting in higher costs for construction\nor operation\nMay be able to use more efficient\nprocedures or non-union labor, resulting\nin cheaper construction\n\nSometimes a PPP is pursued in order to take advantage of the relative strengths of each party. For example, the City\nof Tempe, Arizona needed better flood control, it wanted to clean up an area largely used for waste disposal, and it\nhoped to encourage economic development.2 An innovative arrangement was developed whereby the city assembled\na large parcel of land around the Salt River; they then re-zoned the land for higher density development and sold plots\nto developers with the stipulation that they would pay special fees and taxes that would ultimately pay for the creation\nof a 5-mile long lake and extensive park land. The combination of open space and nearby high-density development\nachieved substantial public benefits, while developers had the opportunity to make profits that were based upon the\nproximity of their land to what would become a very attractive site. Tempe's experience shows how investment in\npublic space can be financed through a combination of taxes and fees targeted to those who will most benefit from\nbeing close to the open space and those who will be attracted to the area because of the open space. Coordinating\nflood control, recreation, waste removal and habitat restoration allowed tremendous improvements in what was\npreviously a rather derelict portion of the city. The financing for the project was been very successful and could serve\nas a template for similar investments in other cities (Figure 3). One potential problem with this project is that it led to\na continuing demand for water, because of evaporation, and water supply could become an ever increasing concern in\nthat region of the country. Other options could have been considered that would have needed much less water, such\nas having a landscaped region surrounding a small creek or restoring the area to its original desert habitat.\nFigure 3 Outline of the Financing for the Tempe Town Lake Project\nThe city buys a large\namount of underdeveloped\nland and agrees to provide\nsupplemental funds\nSell a portion of the\nland to developers\nwho commit to extra\nfees and taxes\nCreate a public\nagency to manage\nthe project, with\nauthority to assess\nfees and special taxes\nCreate parklands and\nother open space\nwithin in a portion of\nthe site\nSell bonds to cover\ncosts of purchase and\npark/open space\nprojects\nInterest Payments:\nSpecified Fees from\ndevelopers cover\ninterest payments on\nbonds\nOperating Expenses:\nAnnually Adjusted\nFees from developers\neventually cover full\ncosts of maintenance\nGeneral Tax\nrevenues may be\nneeded for a portion of\ncosts of operations in\nearly stages of\ndevelopment\nA second reason for public/private partnerships is that there are significant public and private benefits for a potential\nproject. Taken together, the benefits might be enough to justify the project, while neither the public nor the private\nsector may be willing to tackle the project on their own. In Kansas City, private railroads worked with public agencies\nto construct a flyover, which is a railroad bridge that takes one rail line over another rail line. The railroad benefited\nbecause the north-south trains no longer interfered with the east-west trains, while the city and its residents benefited\nbecause delays at rail-highway grade crossings were eliminated or sharply reduced. Public financing reduced the costs\nof the project, while per car fees collected from the railroads will eventually pay for their portion of the project.\n2 Tempe's website has sections devoted to the history and management of the Tempe Town Lake (www.tempe.gov/lake).\n\nA third reason for a PPP is that the public sector wishes to maximize its ability to undertake projects by gaining access\nto the financial markets. The ability of a government agency to raise money may be limited by budgets or by the\ncredit rating of the agency, or a government may be unable to use its assets as collateral to raise money. The\ngovernment can retain control over the design and location of infrastructure, while leasing or selling facilities to a\nprivate company. The financing of the project can be based upon fees that are related to the operation of the facility.\nFor example, the City of Toronto built a toll road that by-passes a portion of their downtown, and they wished to\nextend this road. Since they did not want to issue bonds or raise taxes to pay for the road, they decided to sell the road\nto a company that would operate it and extend it - at the company's expense. They sold the road for more than it had\ncost them to build it, and they thereby were able to have a private company extend the road with no further government\nexpense.\nA fourth reason for a public private partnership would be a government interest in assisting new industries. While the\npotential for economic potential may be evident, and there may be companies willing to undertake projects, the\ncompanies may be unable to secure financing. The government may then decide to assist the company by making\nloans or even by making an equity investment. For example, when the private sector was unable to raise the financing\nnecessary to start off-shore oil drilling in Newfoundland, the provincial government decided to make a substantial\ninvestment in return for partial ownership of the new enterprise.\nIn summary, there are various reasons for PPP:\n-\nComplementary strengths: the partnership builds upon the complementary strengths of the public and\nprivate sectors to complete a project that could not be undertaken - or done as well - by either sector.\n-\nPublic and private benefits: the partnership is created because the project has substantial public and private\nbenefits, and cooperation allows both the public and private sector to satisfy their objectives more effectively\nthat they could by acting alone.\n-\nExpanded public capabilities: the partnership allows private capital to be accessed for undertaking public\nprojects.\n-\nEconomic development:\nthe partnership is created in order to exploit opportunities for economic\ndevelopment that will ultimately be profitable for the private sector while increasing jobs and economic\nactivity within the region.\nAs illustrated by Figure 4, the overall structure of a PPP must incorporate all of the elements that are of importance to\neither sector. The private sector still seeks a positive NPV and successful completion and operation of its portion of\nthe project. The public sector still seeks a positive ratio of benefits to cost and successful completion and operation\nof its portion of the project, with negative social and environmental impacts no worse than anticipated. Both sides of\nthe partnership will need to be satisfied and financially successful if the project is to be a long-term success.\nPrinciples of Public Private Partnerships\nThe most important principle of public private partnerships is that each side must bear an appropriate portion of\nthe cost, benefits, and risks. Private companies are unwilling to increase their investment in projects in order to\nprovide public benefits. Public agencies are unwilling to make investments unless there is a sufficient public benefit.\nPrivate companies will be concerned with financial performance, i.e. cash flows, profitability, and return on\ninvestment. Public agencies will be concerned with cash flow only to the extent that cash is needed to implement a\nproject; they may be willing to make substantial investments that are justified by socio-economic benefits, such as an\nincrease in economic activity or new jobs, reduction in congestion, or improvement in the environment or in public\nhealth.\n\nFigure 4 Overview of a Successful Public/Private Partnership\nJoint Public/Private\nDecision To Proceed\nwith a Project\nPositive B/C for\nPublic Agency\nAvailability of\nFinancing\nAvailability of\nResources\nAbility to Manage\nthe Project\nRegulatory\nApprovals,\nIncluding EIS\nProject Success:\n-\nCompleted per design\n-\nOn-time, on-budget\n-\nOperates as expected\n-\nDemand as expected\n-\nFinancially sustainable for both\nthe public and private sector\n-\nEconomic benefits are in fact\nachieved\n-\nSocial and environmental\nimpacts as expected\n-\nWillingness of public to\ncontinue support via taxation\nPublic Agency's Share of\nFinancial Costs &\nBenefits\nEconomicCosts\n& Benefits\nPositive NPV for\nPrivate Sector\nPrivate Sector's Share of\nFinancial Costs &\nBenefits\nA second principle for private companies is that each project is a separate case. Just because they cooperate with a\npublic agency in one project, they do not want to be forced to cooperate with that agency or other agencies on similar\nprojects or other types of projects in the future.\nA third principle is that the partnership should be designed to deal with a particular situation, since public\nparticipation can take many forms:\n-\nFinancial input and ownership.\n-\nLeasing publicly constructed facilities.\n-\nAuthorizing private construction and operation of a facility that will ultimately revert to the government after\na specified period.\nWhich form of participation is most appropriate will depend upon the circumstances and the aims and capabilities of\nboth the public and private partners. What was best in one situation is not necessarily what should be used in a\nsubsequent situation.\nCreating a Framework for a Partnership\nFor parties to come together in a partnership, all parties must perceive that their potential benefits justify the costs and\nrisks that they incur. As in creating any partnership, negotiation is possible and necessary. Key questions will include\nthe following:\n-\nWho pays how much for what portion of the project?\n-\nWhat risks are accepted by each partner?\n\n-\nWho controls design?\n-\nWho controls construction?\n-\nWho controls operations?\n-\nWho owns what portion of the project?\n-\nWill ownership of the project change over the life of the project?\nThe key differences in the public and private perspectives will include the following:\n-\nFinancial vs. economic return:\no The private sector requires a minimum level of financial performance, but the public agency may\nseek economic benefits such as relief of congestion, potential for development, jobs, and increases\nin regional product.\n-\nCost of capital and access to capital\no The cost of capital will generally be much greater for the private sector than for the public sector.\nThe public sector can raise funds by selling government-guaranteed tax free-bonds that may have\nvery low interest rates, assuming that the government agency has a good credit rating.\no The private sector can raise funds for risky projects by selling stock, thereby giving investors partial\nownership in the company and a chance to make a great deal of money if the project succeeds - as\nwell as a chance to lose everything if the project fails.\no The financial markets recognize and accept the possibility that a project will not be successful and\nthat companies may be forced into bankruptcy; it is possible and not unusual for companies to fail,\nbut public agencies are expected to endure despite failure.\n-\nInstitutional and organizational flexibility\no Public agencies control many of the policies and institutional requirements that constrain or limit a\nproject; a public agency is likely to be in a better position to obtain approvals for such things as\nzoning variances, building permits, and environmental approvals, because the public agency will\ngenerally be viewed as working in the public interest.\no Private companies will likely be more flexible in creating organizational structures to deal with the\ndesign, construction, and operation of projects, especially projects that would be much different or\nmuch larger than what the public agencies have been involved in.\n-\nTime frame\no The time frame of private companies is heavily influenced by the fact that discounting reduces\npresent value of both positive and negative impacts that may occur in the distant future; public\nagencies a) typically have a lower discount rate and b) typically have ethical commitments,\nconstitutional outlooks, and other factors that lead them to have a much greater concern for what\nhappens in the very long run.\nThese four major differences in interests and perspective suggest ways that PPP can be productive. The role of the\npublic agency may be designing the project so that it provides economic, social, or environmental benefits to the\npublic, providing access to low-cost sources of capital, securing project approvals from the various agencies involved\nin the project, or ensuring that the project provides long-term positive benefits to the public. The role of the private\nsector may be designing the project so that it generates cash flows sufficient to justify the necessary investments,\nproviding access to financial markets that are willing and able to provide funds for very large or somewhat uncertain\nprojects, creating new organizations to help in designing, constructing and operating a project, and ensuring that the\nproject does not take too long a time perspective.\n\nDetermining How Much to Invest in a PPP\nThe analysis of a potential PPP will be approached by each party using the tools and techniques that they would use\nfor any other project. Each party will have to estimate the cash flows associated with the project, and the public\nagency will also have to estimate the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits that are expected.\nThe private partner will have to be satisfied that its NPV is likely to be positive or that its internal rate of return is\nlikely to be acceptable, based upon reasonable assumptions about the factors that will influence the outcomes of the\nproject. The private partner will not be interested in increasing its investment in order to allow greater public benefits,\nbut may be willing to agree to a modified project so long as the public sector agrees to pay for any added costs.\nLikewise, the public partner will have to be satisfied the benefit/cost ratio is adequate, based upon their perception of\nthe possible outcomes of the project. Both the benefits and costs can include non-financial factors such as\nimprovements in congestion or air quality or access to public services. They can also include the economic benefits\nfor the regions, such as job creation or the impact on average income or gross regional product.\nEach partner will be able to determine the maximum amount that they would be willing to contribute to the project; if\nthe combined amounts that they are willing to pay exceed the cost of the project, then it is feasible. The parties will\nnaturally try to find an arrangement where their actual contribution is less than what they are willing to pay, a process\nthat could take some time. Note that it is not necessary for one party to explain its reasoning or to provide its\nassumptions about unit costs or expected outcomes to the other party. The negotiations can proceed based upon what\neach partner is willing to contribute and what arrangements are made for sharing the risks associated with the project.\nFigure 5 suggests how a public agency might negotiate with private developers in order to create more housing that is\naffordable for low income residents. From the public agency's perspective, there are three key issues:\n-\nThe amount of money available for constructing or subsidizing housing for low-income residents.\n-\nThe cost/unit of constructing public housing for low-income residents, which places an upper limit on the\nsubsidy/unit that they will be willing to pay.\n-\nThe feasibility of changing zoning rules to allow more intensive development, which will determine how\nmuch of an incentive can be offered to developers.\n-\nThe ability to guarantee the developer's loans if the developer agrees to reserve a certain number of units for\nlow income residents.\nFrom the developer's perspective, the key factors are:\n-\nThe cost per unit for construction, which must be covered by the combination of rent from the low income\noccupant and the subsidy from the public agency. This determines the minimum subsidy that they will accept.\n-\nThe ability to make more money if they are allowed to develop more units on a given plot of land, which\nwould allow them to include more subsidized units or to reduce the minimum subsidy that they would require.\n-\nWhether or not the benefits of lower interest rates are sufficient to offset the lost rents if some units are\nreserved for low income residents.\n-\nOther opportunities for development: is it worth their while to negotiate or should they simply build what is\ncurrently allowed on the sites they own or consider projects in other locations?\nThus there will be two aspects to the negotiation. First, if the minimum subsidy that the developer will accept is less\nthan the maximum that the public agency is willing to provide, then there could be a negotiated subsidy per unit.\nSecond, if it is feasible to modify the zoning or offer loan guarantees, it would be possible for the developer to\nundertake more profitable development in return for including more units for low income residents.\n\nFigure 5 Key Factors in Negotiating for Low-Income Housing\nMaximum Subsidy Per Unit:\nNet Cost/unit for Public Agency to\nConstruct Low-Income Housing\nFunds Available to\nPublic Agency\nPotential Profit from Re-Zoning\nand Loan Guarantees\nDeveloper\ngiven cheap loans or allowed more\nintensive development, if subsidized\nunits are included\nSubsidy/unit that Public Agency\nagrees to pays as incentive to create\nhousing for low income residents\nMinimum Subsidy Per Unit:\nDifference between developer's\ncost/unit and maximum rent for low\nincome resident\nNumber of units for low income\nresidents, at given level of subsidy\nAbility to Make Loan Guarantees or\nallow Zoning Changes that alllow\nmore intensive development\nNegotiation\nOpportunities\nAvailable to Developer\nNegotiation\nZoning Changes for Mixed\nHousing Developments\nExample: Using a PPP to Maximize a City's Ability to Undertake Projects - Toronto's Highway 4073\nBy using a PPP, a government entity can capture the value of its infrastructure, while moving the burden for creating\nnew infrastructure to the private sector. This example shows how the province of Ontario built a state-of-the-art\nhighway, then leased it for 99 years to a private consortium for double what it had cost to build. The consortium even\ncommitted to extend the highway, at no cost to the city.\nThe story begins in 1994, when construction began on a 69-km fully automated toll road that would create another\nroute through Toronto, thereby adding capacity to one of the most congested highway corridors in Canada. The\nProvince of Ontario financed the C$1.5 billion project by selling taxable, general obligation bonds. The road opened\nin 1997, attracting 200,000 trips per day and annual revenues of C$70 million. Two years later, Ontario decided to\nprivatize the road by leasing it to a private company that would agree to construct the planned 39-km extension, which\nwas expected to cost C$0.5 billion.\nThe province asked for bids on the highway, assuming a 99-year lease. Since the value of the highway depended\nentirely upon the tolls that could be collected, certain restrictions were placed on tolls. The tolls were initially limited\nto 10 cents per mile for automobiles, with an increase to 13 cents per mile over 15 years plus adjustments for inflation.\nTolls were two to three times higher for trucks. Beyond 15 years, there would be no limit on tolls so long as peak-\nhour traffic volumes exceeded 9,000 vehicles per hour. No limit was placed on the potential ROI for the successful\nbidder.\nThe winning bid was submitted by a consortium that agreed to a purchase price of C$3.1 billion for a 99-year lease,\nwhich was slightly more than double the construction cost of the first section of the highway. The company was\nrequired to maintain nearly $400 million of working capital, and they were required to keep C$775 million equity in\n3 Source: Traffic Technology International Journal, June/July 1999\n\nthe project.\nThese restrictions limited the amount that the company could borrow, thereby limiting the risk of\nbankruptcy. The expected return on their investment was 11%.\nThe key issues in this deal concern the level of tolls, future volumes of traffic, and the role of this highway in the\nregional transportation system. By charging tolls, the highway operator captures some of the general economic benefits\nof the highway. Conceivably, a private company could maximize its profit by charging very high tolls, thereby\nenabling this highway to operate with little or no congestion, while traffic that could easily go on this route would\nshift to other, much more congested highways. Selling parts of the system could make it more difficult to manage the\noverall highway network effectively.\nThis example demonstrates a way for governments to tap the enormous value of public infrastructure. Ontario had\nbuilt the road as part of its on-going program of highway construction. It built the road as a toll-road on the assumption\nthat the tolls would be sufficient to cover the interest on the construction bonds, along with the expenses of operating\nthe highway. They wanted to sell the road to a private company largely in order to move the debt associated with the\nroad off the public accounts, thereby protecting or improving the province's credit rating. In fact, the deal did much\nmore than takeover the debt associated with the highway: it provided an extra C$1.5 billion to the treasury and the\nwinning bidder agreed to finance the next section of the road as well.\nIn the U.S., politicians in several states including Pennsylvania and New Jersey have considered similar projects, in\nwhich the rights to operate existing toll roads would be sold at auction. If the private operator is allowed to charge\nmuch higher tolls, then the toll roads could have a value far in excess of the original costs. Of course, similar financial\nbenefits could be obtained if the states raised their own tolls, and that in fact is what happened in New Jersey.\nExample: Using Public Investment to Stimulate the Economy - Investment in off-shore oil exploration by the\nProvince of Newfoundland and Labrador\nIn 1979, after 16 years of research and exploration, oil was discovered in the Hibernia oil field located off the coast of\nNewfoundland, Canada. The high prices of oil at that time justified looking for oil offshore, even though the costs of\noffshore drilling are very high. Political disputes between the federal and provincial governments delayed exploitation\nof the oil field for more than a decade, as both claimed jurisdiction over the area.4 After the political battles were\nsettled, construction finally began in 1991 on an enormous platform and related infrastructure for extracting 150,000\nbarrels of crude oil per day.\nThe project was undertaken by a consortium of five oil companies along with a new government agency called the\nCanada Hibernia Holding Corporation that owned an 8.5% share in the project. The government participation in the\nproject was designed to produce income for the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, one of the poorest provinces\nof Canada. The construction and operation of the site plus additional energy-related jobs provided a major boost to\nprovincial economy. There were 5,000 construction jobs, and the growth in the energy sector boosted the region's\neconomic activity by 3.1% during the first year of operation.\n4 G.E. Bridges & Associates, \"Due Diligence Issues Report\", British Columbia Offshore Oil and Gas Socio-Economic Issue Papers,\nRoyal Road University, Victoria BC, Canada May 2004\n\nSummary\nMotivation for Public Private Partnerships\nThe public and private sectors have differing types of objectives and complementary strengths in defining, financing,\nconstructing and managing projects. Thus, there will be many situations where projects are likely to be better\ndesigned, constructed or operated if the two sectors work together. The public sector is structured so as to allocate\nresources among competing public needs, whereas the private sector is structured so as to achieve financial objectives.\nThe public sector has the ability to raise funds via taxation or by issuing bonds backed by specific revenue sources\n(e.g. tolls or user fees), but for financial or political reasons may have limits upon the amount of money that can be\nraised for major infrastructure projects. The private sector has greater ability to attract investors for large projects that\nmay be risky, but that have potential for high profits. The public sector has the power to impose and modify many of\nthe laws and regulations that affect development, including zoning, other land use regulations, and environmental and\nsocial regulations. The public also has the power of eminent domain whereby a public agency may be able to force\nlandowners to sell their land so that it can be used for a public purpose, such as a road, a dam, or a reservoir.\nThe public sector may have agencies devoted to certain types of infrastructure, such as highways and waterworks, but\nthey may not have experienced employees capable of dealing with major new projects in important areas. Private\ncompanies with specialized skills will be able to apply those skills throughout the world. Private companies may also\nhave greater experience and therefore greater efficiency in undertaking certain types of projects.\nCreating a Partnership\nNegotiation will be necessary to ensure that all parties to the agreement believe that their costs will justify the costs\nand the risks that they incur. The private sector will participate only if they perceive sufficient financial benefits. The\npublic sector may in part be concerned with financial matters, but must be sure that the projected benefits - whether\nor not they are financial or economic benefits - are sufficient to justify whatever social and environmental costs and\nbenefits may be incurred.\nThe negotiations will consider design, financing, responsibility for construction\nmanagement, responsibility for operations, and ownership. The risks include the usual risks associated with\nconstruction of and demand for a project. In addition, there will a question as to the extent to which the public and\nthe private sector share the risks of financial failure: to what extent, if any, will the public sector be responsible for\npaying off bonds? The public sector will be able to accept long-term social and environmental benefits as justification\nfor their participation, but the private sector will require more immediate financial benefits.\nThe analysis of a potential PPP will be approached by each party using the tools and techniques that they would use\nfor any other project. Each party will have to estimate the cash flows associated with the project, and the public\nagency will also have to estimate the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits that are expected. The\nprivate partner will have to be satisfied that its NPV is likely to be positive or that its internal rate of return is likely to\nbe acceptable, based upon reasonable assumptions about the factors that will influence the outcomes of the project.\nLikewise, the public partner will have to be satisfied the benefit/cost ratio is adequate, based upon their perception of\nthe possible outcomes of the project. Each partner will be able to determine the maximum amount that they would be\nwilling to contribute to the project; if the combined amounts that they are willing to pay exceed the cost of the project,\nthen it is feasible. The parties will naturally try to find an arrangement where their actual contribution is less than\nwhat they are willing to pay, a process that could take some time.\n\nTypes of Public Private Partnerships\nFour types of situations that are well-suited to the establishment of a public private partnership:\n1. The project requires the complementary strengths of the public and private sector.\n2. The project provides both public and private benefits, and only the combined benefits are large enough to\njustify the project.\n3. The public sector wishes to maximize its ability to undertake projects by gaining access to the financial\nmarkets.\n4. The public sector decides to assist new industries.\n\nEvolution of Infrastructure-Based Systems\nBut it came to me then, I am sure, for the first time how promiscuous, how higgledy-piggeldy was the whole\nof that jumble of mines and homes, collieries and pot-bands, railway yards, canals, schools, forges and blast\nfurnaces, churches, chapels, allotment hovels, a vast irregular agglomeration of ugly smoking accidents in\nwhich men lived as happy as frogs in a dustbin. Each thing jostled and damaged the other things about it;\neach ignored the other things about it, the smoke of the furnace defiled the pot-bank clay, the clatter of the\nrailway deafened the in church, the public house thrust corruption at the school doors, the dismal homes\nsqueezed miserably amidst worshippers the monstrosities of industrialism, with an effect of groping imbecility.\nHumanity choked amidst its products, and all its energy went in increasing its disorder, like a blind stricken\nthing that struggles and sinks in a morass.\nH.G. Wells, In the Days of the Comet, 1906\nIntroduction\nMore than a hundred years ago, H.G. Wells, following in the tradition of Dickens, Jules Verne and other great 19th\ncentury novelists, railed against the pollution, the ugliness, the immorality, and the disorder of city life in the industrial\nsociety. In one scathing paragraph he raises vivid images of many of the disorders that have plagued cities for\nthousands of years and that persist to this day: pollution, noise, corruption, thoughtless development, and horrid\nenvironments for children. Today, other ills and other fears could be added to the list: climate change, over-use of\nfossil fuels, looming crises with respect to water supply, fears of lethal flu pandemics, terrorism, and even collapse of\ncivilized life in more than one country. What is to be done?\nWhat is to be done is what has always been done: recognize the problems, understand the causes of the problems, and\ntry to do something to deal with the problems. The worst excesses of the Industrial Revolution that were so well\ndepicted by Dickens have been eradicated by regulation of industry, better energy technology, and provision of social\nservices to the poor. The \"dismal homes squeezed miserably amidst the monstrosities of industrialization\" have, at\nleast in the developed countries, been succeeded by urban regions that have evolved into places more suitable for\npeople. Humanity struggled mightily during the 20th century with its World Wars, political upheavals, and\ninnumerable lesser wars and disasters, but for the most part, we have not yet sunk into the morass, and we seek to\nimprove the world for our children and grandchildren.\nOver the past two hundred years, investments in infrastructure have made astounding differences in the quality of life\nfor most people in most areas of the world. First railways, then automobiles, buses, and airplanes brought mobility to\nunprecedented levels. With cheap transportation and warehousing, it is possible to ensure that food and other supplies\nare available throughout the world; droughts and natural disasters still cause hardship, but relief efforts can at least\nlimit the amount of on-going loss of life and despair that once followed such calamities. Construction of reservoirs,\naqueducts, and water treatment facilities eliminated the ravages of cholera and other diseases and allowed cities to\ngrow without destroying the health of their citizens. The telegraph, then the telephone, and now the internet have\nmade instantaneous communications a reality and a global perspective a necessity. Innovations in design and materials\nhave reduced the costs of construction, allowed construction of skyscrapers, and made it possible to create great cities.\nBetter regulations have helped to reduce air quality and water quality, and public and private initiatives have created\nhundreds of parks and ecological reserves.\nWe have made a great deal of progress. But much more remains to be done. People need to continue working to\ncreate a more sustainable world, and much of this effort must be allocated toward creating more sustainable\ninfrastructure-based systems. This will be a slow process, because infrastructure systems last for decades and cannot\nbe changed overnight. This will be an evolutionary process that incorporates and responds to new technologies, new\nmanagement techniques, and major changes in society's perception of infrastructure needs and performance. This\nwill be an important process, because we will all benefits as we move toward systems that can be more easily\nmaintained, that are better suited toward society's needs, and that are less intrusive upon the environment.\n\nInfrastructure evolves through a series of incremental steps, including specific projects and programs, incorporation\nof new technologies, development of better management strategies, use of new types of materials and energy sources,\nand new regulations concerning the use and design of infrastructure. It is important to take a long-term perspective in\nthinking about moving toward more sustainable infrastructure. While progress may be slow, progress is certainly\npossible. Understanding how infrastructure systems evolve can be helpful in looking at any proposed project. The\nhistorical context will always be important, and knowing about the different stages in infrastructure evolution can be\nhelpful in determining whether a particular proposal is meaningful step in the right direction or merely an ill-fated\nattempt to keep an obsolete system functioning for a few more years.\nVery few infrastructure projects are either completely new or completely independent. Most projects will be\nimplemented using proven technologies and construction methods, and the completed project will fit into an existing\nnetwork or an existing pattern of similar facilities serving much the same purpose. Project evaluation may often boil\ndown to rather simple ideas: rents are high so this is a good time to build office buildings; roads are congested so let's\nbuild more roads; demand for electricity is growing so let's build more power plants; demand for water is growing,\nso let's build more reservoirs; the number of children is increasing so let's build more schools. In all of these cases,\nthe needs are clear; the costs of building some more capacity are well-understood; and it is easy to figure out whether\nthe investment is justified given the potential revenue from rents, tolls, or fees or the willingness of the public to pay\ntaxes for schools and infrastructure. There may be long periods of time when society continues along a well-defined\npath, expanding infrastructure as needed to handle growth in population and rising demand for services.\nHowever, these periods of stability will eventually be disrupted by fundamental changes in technology, institutions,\npolitical power, economic conditions, or societal norms. Technological innovation, which will continually be offering\nopportunities to improve the functioning of an existing system, will from time to time make it possible to introduce\nmuch better systems. In the early part of the 19th century, canals took freight from toll roads; a few decades later,\nrailroads began to take freight from the canals; a hundred years later trucks operating over paved roads began to take\nfreight from the railroads. And throughout this period, technological improvements for roads, canals, railroads,\nvehicles, and communications helped to reduce the costs of all kinds of freight transportation.\nTable 1 indicates different stages that may be encountered in the evolution of transportation or other infrastructure-\nbased systems. As with freight transportation, the evolution may be something that proceeds over hundreds of years,\nwith different infrastructure systems emerging to support new technologies. Reaching a new equilibrium may take\ndecades, and if technological innovation continues, an equilibrium may never be reached. Instead, the new systems\nwill be growing side-by-side with the older systems that are in decline.\nTable 1 Stages in the Evolution of Infrastructure-Based Systems\nI\nTechnological Experimentation and Demonstration\nII\nWide-Spread, Uncoordinated Implementation\nIII\nDevelopment of Systems\nIV\nConsolidation and Rationalization\nV\nTechnological and Institutional Advancement\nVI\nResponding to Competition\nVII\nMitigating Social and Environmental Impacts\nVIII\nRetrenching and Obsolescence\nWe will address each of these stages, keeping in mind that there is no pre-determined sequence or timetable for passing\nfrom one stage to another. The basic methods and concepts of project evaluation can be useful in any of these stages\nof development:\n-\nIdentifying needs and objectives and generating alternatives for meeting those needs.\n-\nSpecifying criteria for evaluating alternatives and conducting financial, economic, environmental and social\nanalysis.\n\n-\nAssessing the differences among alternatives using weighting schemes and an appropriate political process\ninvolving major stakeholders.\n-\nSelecting the best strategy and refining it to increase efficiency and effectiveness and to mitigate negative\nenvironmental and social impacts.\nUnderstanding the themes and issues that are likely to be encountered in each stage of development may be helpful in\nfocusing the evaluation on the most relevant concerns and avoiding some of the most costly mistakes in evaluation.\nIt is useful to understand how infrastructure-based systems have evolved over a period of decades in order to gain\nsome insight in the evolutionary process. For example, several technological developments of the late 19th century\nmade it feasible to build much taller buildings, which meant the economics of urban real estate were markedly and\nforever changed. The ability to make more intensive use of land led to dramatic increases in urban development, with\na perhaps inevitable cycle of boom and bust. Railroads have been evolving for nearly 200 years, providing an even\nlonger perspective on the evolution of an infrastructure-based system. Large portions of the rail system have already\nreached the final stages of obsolescence, and the railroads have already retrenched; operating over smaller networks\nusing better technology, they are now serve fewer customers whose traffic is best suited to the low-cost service that\nrailroads can provide.\nEngineers, planners, politicians, corporations, and the public will faced major challenges in the 21st century in order\nto move toward more sustainable infrastructure. Many kinds of projects will be needed to meet these challenges,\nincluding rehabilitation of existing infrastructure in order to extend its useful life, replacement of certain elements of\nexisting infrastructure in order to enhance performance, and construction of new infrastructure that embodies more\nsustainable technologies and designs.\nStage I Technological Experimentation and Demonstration\nFrom time to time, someone comes up with a new technology that seems to offer a better means of satisfying some\nbasic need of society. The first task is to figure out how to make the technology work, which may take years of\nexperimentation and tinkering. Eventually there will be a demonstration that the new technology works, and there\nwill be a few entrepreneurs or government agencies who back some initial implementations to determine whether or\nnot the technology is financially feasible. Two hundred years ago, inventors figured out how to use a steam engine to\npull a few cars along a railroad track at 10-20mph, which was a great improvement over a horse & wagon or a canal\nboat; in the 21st century, there are a few demonstrations of how to use magnetic levitation for a train to reach speeds\nclose to that of airplanes. The railroad proved to be an extremely successful technology, and hundreds of thousands\nof miles of rail lines were constructed throughout the world within a hundred years of its introduction. It remains to\nbe seen whether magnetic levitation proves to be a wide-spread alternative to air travel or remains an odd-ball tourist\nattraction for getting to and from the airport in Shanghai and perhaps a few other locations.\nRelevant methodologies:\n-\nMeasuring System Performance: what kinds of performance improvements are most critical? What\ntechnologies are likely to provide such improvements in performance? How will any proposed technology\naffect cost, capacity, service quality, safety and other aspects of system performance?\n-\nProbabilistic risk assessment: what are the risks associated with the new technology? How can those risks\nbe minimized? Will the new technology be perceived as safe by potential users, abutters, and the general\npublic?\n-\nPerformance-based technology assessment: will the anticipated improvement in performance be enough to\nattract users or supporters who will be willing and able to pay for the new system?\nPotential pitfalls:\n-\nExcessive investments in technologies that, even if successful, are very unlikely to attract much of a market.\n\n-\nIntroduction of a technology without adequate safeguards, leading to highly publicized failures that cause\ngovernments or the public to reject the technology.\n-\nIntroduction of a technology without adequate consideration of externalities, leading to government or public\nperceptions that the technology should be rejected because of its impacts on abutters, communities, or the\nenvironment.\n-\nFailure to consider the potential impact of new technologies, thereby delaying the introduction - and\ndeferring potentially large benefits - of new technologies.\n-\nGovernment regulations that reject or hinder new technologies that would have broad benefits to society, but\nthat are opposed by special interests.\nStage II Widespread, Uncoordinated Implementation\nOnce the technical and financial feasibility have been demonstrated, there will likely be a great many uncoordinated,\nfiercely competitive attempts to build up the infrastructure and related systems for the new technology. Once the\nautomobile was shown to be feasible, dozens of manufacturers emerged, producing a great variety of styles and\nexperimenting with steam and electrical systems for propulsion as well as with the internal combustion engine. The\nearly automobiles had to use the existing roads, which were little better in 1900 than they had been in 1800 (and not\nas good as the roads that the Romans had built nearly 2000 years earlier).\nRelevant methodologies:\n-\nFinancial Analysis: how will introduction of the new technologies be financed?\n-\nBrainstorming, sensitivity analysis, and scenarios:\nwhat are the options for deployment? What are the\nfactors that are most likely to affect success or failure?\nPotential Pitfalls:\n-\nStarting up too small, with insufficient coverage to attract enough users to support the service.\n-\nStarting up too big, resulting in too much debt and too little revenue.\n-\nStarting without adequate financial reserves, leaving the project vulnerable to a strong response from\ncompetitors or a downturn in the economy.\n-\nWaiting too long to get started, which means that competitors capture the market.\nStage III Development of Systems\nThe initial, uncoordinated efforts will provide a great deal of information and insight concerning what is needed for\nreasonably efficient implementation of the new technology. Companies involved in network-based systems (such as\nelectricity transmission, irrigation, transportation and telecommunications) will realize that there are economies of\nscale and density; they will try to expand, via construction or mergers, to obtain these economies. Cities will realize\nthat some systems, such as water delivery, need to be coordinated to avoid costly duplication of infrastructure and to\nallow cost-effective services to customers. Companies and public agencies will decide how best to structure their\nsystems, whether or not to integrate operations and maintenance of the systems, and how best to coordinate their\nactivities with related activities.\nDuring this stage of development, attention must be given to structuring and\nintegrating infrastructure and operations so as to handle growth.\nRelevant Methodologies:\n-\nDetermining the extent to which there are likely to be economies of scale, scope or density, i.e. understanding\nhow costs and other aspects of performance vary with the structure of the system.\n-\nIdentifying and assessing strategic options for expansion.\n\nPotential Pitfalls:\n-\nCreation of unregulated monopolies that in fact achieve great reductions in average cost, but that are able to\ncharge excessive prices for their services.\n-\nDifficulties in consolidation caused by lack of interoperability, i.e. the failure of companies and agencies to\ndevelop compatible technologies that will facilitate coordination and cooperation.\n-\nCompetition that reduces prices to marginal costs that are below average costs, thereby limiting the ability to\nfinance desirable increases in capacity or enhancements to facilities.\nStage IV Consolidation and Rationalization\nIt is frequently the case that the enthusiastic response to new technologies leads to overbuilding, the creation of\ninfrastructure that has too little or too much capacity, and the inevitable problems in design and network structure that\ncome from the initial uncoordinated investments. Even though the size and scope of the systems may be reasonable,\nthere will be many opportunities for improving performance by consolidating portions of the system, by eliminating\nbottlenecks, and by abandoning pieces that are obsolete or underutilized.\nRelevant Methodologies:\n-\nBasic modeling of costs, service, competition and financial viability.\n-\nEstimation of public benefits of consolidation and rationalization (in order to obtain public support and\nperhaps public funding for complex projects that will cause major disruptions during an extended period of\nconstruction).\nPotential Pitfalls:\n-\nDifficulties in abandoning underutilized portions of a network because of public pressures to maintain\nservices viewed as necessary by customers and local governments.\n-\nDifficulties in assembling tracts of land suitable for consolidated facilities.\n-\nDifficulties in financing the investments in a competitive environment where prices are likely to fall quickly\nto new, lower marginal costs following completion of desirable projects.\nStage V Technological and Institutional Advancement\nManagers, researchers, consultants, and regulatory agencies will continually be seeking new technologies,\nmanagement strategies, and institutional arrangements that will improve the performance of the system. The goals\nduring this stage are to reduce costs, enhance safety or improve service, taking advantage of better control\ntechnologies, better materials, or better management. During this stage, system improvements come from looking\ninward so as to find opportunities for doing the job better. Technological advances may result in the use of new\nprocedures or greatly improve the performance of what were thought to be obsolete procedures.\nRelevant Methodologies:\n-\nBasic modeling of costs, service, competition and financial viability.\n-\nPerformance-based technology scanning.\n-\nProject and program audits.\n\nPotential Pitfalls:\n-\nFailure to provide for adequate maintenance and rehabilitation of the system.\n-\nFailure to anticipate changes in competition, technology, or society; an over-confident management that may\nsuddenly find that the capacity, cost, condition, or service quality of its infrastructure are woefully out of step\nwith what is needed.\nExample: New Technology Can Revive Old Methods - Wastewater Treatment in San Diego, California1\nRecent technological advances have resulted in a major shift in the preferred methods for wastewater treatment. Metal\nsalts were widely used in England in the 19th century to increase the level of coagulation and flocculation in municipal\nwastewater treatments. While the technique was effective, it greatly increased the amount of sludge that had to be\ndisposed, adding substantially to the overall costs of treatment. As a result, by the 1930s, the preferred method of\nwastewater treatment changed to unaided gravitational settling followed by a biological process. New techniques,\nknown as chemically enhanced primary treatments (CEPT), have recently improved the performance of primary\nwastewater treatment plants without generating nearly as much sludge. Since more of the pollutants are removed by\nCEPT, the demand upon the biological treatments is reduced. Research efforts at the Point Loma wastewater treatment\nplant in San Diego, California demonstrated the effectiveness of CEPT. Spurred by the need to meet new regulations\nregarding effluent, the operators came up with a CEPT method that was more efficient, produced minimal amounts of\nadditional sludge, and increased the capacity of the system.\n\"Ultimately the system was so successful that Congress waived the usual requirement for secondary\ntreatment, saving the city an estimated two billion dollars and allowing the construction of a tertiary water\nreclamation facility that now reuses 15% of the total wastewater flow instead of discharging it into the\nocean.\"2\nCEPT is now seen as an excellent, low-cost option for treating wastewater, especially in the developing world, since\nthis method makes it possible to achieve better performance from existing, over-burdened facilities.\nExample: Replacing Old Infrastructure with More Effective Systems - Wastewater Treatment in Kaukauna,\nWisconsin3\nThe Heart of the Valley Metropolitan Sewerage District of Kaukauna Wisconsin provides services to the city of\nKaunauna and nearby towns. The district's original treatment plant was built in the 1930s, then converted into a\nregional treatment plant in the 1970s, and again upgraded and expanded in the 1990s. Two major factors made further\nenhancements necessary: population growth and stricter regulations regarding discharge. The district has a population\nof 42 thousand that was expected to grow to 68 thousand by 2029, which would cause peak demands to exceed the\nplant's capacity. Second, new state regulations required limiting ammonia nitrogen concentrations to 3.6 mg/L in\nsummer and 10 mg/L in winter, while the existing facility discharged effluent with 20 mg/L. The crucial design\nproblem was the lack of space, since the site had long since been hemmed in by a large mill on two sides and a canal\nand the Fox River on the other two sides. To handle the expected 100-year peak loads using conventional technology,\nit would be necessary to add substantial elements to the plant:\n-\nFour primary clarifiers, each with a diameter of 115 feet and a capacity of 60 million gallons/day (mgd)\n-\nFour final clarifiers, each with a diameter of 90 feet and a capacity of 25.4 mgd\n-\nA nitrifying aeration basin area of an acre (200 ft by 200 feet)\n1 Michael R. Bourke, Donald R.F. Harleman, Heidi Li, Susan E. Murcott, Gautam Narasimhan and Irene W. Yu, Innovative\nWastewater Treatment in the Developing World, Civil Engineering Practice, Spring/Summer 2002, pp. 25-34\n2 Bourke et al., op. cit., p. 27\n3 Thomas E. Vik, Mark Surwillo, Small Footprint, Big Promise, Civil Engineering, February 2008, pp. 66-85.\n\nSince the site was too small to accommodate these new facilities, it was impossible to consider using conventional\ntechnology at that site. The possibility of acquiring a new site was considered, but deemed to be too expensive.\nInstead, the District decided to use more efficient treatment processes, some of which had been used in Europe, but\nnot in the U.S. To implement the new systems, the District was able to convert portions of the old facility to new\nuses, to replace some of the old plant with portions of the new system, and to convert some open space and a parking\nlot to other portions of the new system. The end result was a treatment plant that required a much smaller footprint,\nprovided much higher capacity, and removed much more of the pollutants. Table 2 shows how the primary treatment\ntechnologies that were implemented as part of this project used a tenth of the space while removing more of three key\npollutants: carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD), total suspended solids (TSS) and phosphorous.\nTable 2 Comparison of Conventional Primary Treatment Technologies with Those Implemented in Kaunaua\nArea of Facilities\nRemoval of CBOD\nRemoval of TSS\nRemoval of\nPhosphorous\nConventional\n40,000 sq. ft.\n30%\n50%\n0%\nKaunaua\n3,850 sq. ft.\n50-60%\n70-80%\n75-85%\nThis example provides two major lessons. First, new technologies may make it possible to use existing sites far more\neffectively by reducing the footprint required for key facilities. Second, new technologies may be more effective,\nthereby resulting in a better level of service for the infrastructure.\nStage VI Responding to Competition\nNo system is immune to competition, and competitive threats are likely to increase as the system ages. Competition\nwill reduce demand for a system, and over time competition could eliminate the need for a system. Several kinds of\nthreats are possible:\n-\nCompetition from similar systems: competition is based upon the ability of the competitors to use similar\ntechnologies to provide services to customers.\n-\nCompetition from systems based upon different technologies to provide the same service: in this type\nof competition, the competitors use completely different technologies to serve the same types of needs.\n-\nCompetition from systems based upon different technologies that eliminate the need for the service:\nin this type of competition, some kind of technological innovation provides a new way of doing business\nthat has the potential for reducing the demand for existing services.\nRelevant Methodologies:\n-\nBasic modeling of costs, service, competition and financial viability.\n-\nPerformance-Based Technology scanning.\n-\nBrainstorming and scenarios.\nPotential Pitfalls:\n-\nFailure to consider how current conditions might change.\n-\nOverconfidence based upon past glory or past profitability.\n-\nRegulations relevant to old technologies that limit the introduction of new technologies that may require less\nfrequent inspection, support higher loads, or allow different methods of operation\n\nExamples: Competition Faced by the Airline Industry\nCompetition from Similar Systems: Low-Cost Airlines Competing with Legacy Airlines\nDuring the late 20th century, new airlines decided to serve selected markets from smaller airports using low-cost crews\nand new, efficient planes. Some of these airlines, notably Southwest Airlines in the U.S. and Ryan Air in Europe,\nwere extremely successful with this strategy and diverted substantial numbers of people from the older airlines. The\nsuccess of these airlines helped provide an impetus to upgrade facilities and expand capacity at airports in many\nsmaller cities. Airports in Manchester, New Hampshire and Providence, Rhode Island, which are about 50 miles from\nLogan Airport in Boston, began to compete with Logan for the same air travelers.\nCompetition from Systems Using Different Technologies to Provide the Same Service: High-Speed Rail Competing\nwith Airlines\nHigh-speed railroads can compete effectively with airlines for trips of 200 to 500 miles. Which mode captures the\nlargest share of the market will depend in part upon technological capabilities and in part upon public policy toward\ninvesting in transportation. In many airports, a large percentage of travelers are taking these medium-distance trips,\nso diverting travelers to trains can reduce the need for investment in airport capacity.\nCompetition from Systems Using Technologies that Eliminate the Need for the service: Telecommunications\nCompeting with Airline Travel\nVideo conferencing facilities, cheap telecommunications, and the internet allow virtual conferences that reduce the\nneed for business travel; email allows the exchange of information without requiring the use of the post office; catalog\nor internet shopping allows people to purchase items without visiting stores. These changes reduce the demand for\nbusiness travel, reduce the use of aircraft for mail, and increase the use of air freight to support delivery of all those\nitems ordered on-line.\nStage VII Mitigating Social and Environmental Impacts\nSocial and environment impacts are likely to become more important over the life of any infrastructure-based system\nfor two primary reasons.\nWhen a system is first developed, the societal needs may be so clear that any obvious\nnegative impacts of the new system are easily accommodated. However, society eventually demands that something\nbe done about these problems. For example, the benefits of railroads and automobiles in enhancing mobility and\nopportunity far outweighed the fact that both modes were originally very noisy, dirty and risky.\nAfter a system has been functioning, it may become apparent that its social or environmental impacts are unacceptable.\nAs automobile accidents began to account for tens of thousands of fatalities annually, highway safety became a major\nissue in both vehicle design and highway design. When the public realized that drunk drivers caused a high proportion\nof the fatalities, they forced government agencies to impose stricter penalties and greater enforcement of laws intended\nto reduce driving while drunk.\nImplementation of new technologies often creates problems that were not anticipated and that were only identified\nafter many years or decades of experience. For example, automobile exhaust was not a major public concern until\nwell after there were enough automobiles to cause a noticeable degradation in air quality. The initial concerns about\nautomobile emissions were related to air pollution and its effects on visibility, deterioration of buildings, and above\nall human health. By 1970, it was clear that automobile exhaust contributed heavily to smog and that air pollution\nwas a serious health problem. About that time, governments began to impose regulations on emissions and on fuel\nconsumption, with the result that air quality improved despite increases in automobiles and trucks. The efforts to\nreduce emissions focused on pollutants, including carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides. In the United\nStates, emission standards for new vehicles were first imposed in 1968 and strengthened with the passage of the Clean\nAir Act in 1970. Within twenty years, the average emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from new cars\n\nwere only 4% of what they had been in 1970, while emissions of nitrogen oxides were only a quarter of what they had\nbeen. These dramatic improvements were enabled by a new technology, the catalytic converter, which effectively\nprevented the release of most of these pollutants.\nAlthough the air quality in major cities improved because of regulation of emissions, a new, more difficult problem\nemerged, namely the threat of global warming and climate change. As the 20th century came to an end, scientific\nevidence increasingly pointed to an accelerating world-wide rise in average temperatures and a link between global\nwarming and the emission of greenhouse gases. These gases not only included carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and\nnitrogen oxides, they also included carbon dioxide, which is much more difficult to control and which is not normally\nconsidered to be a pollutant. By the early 20th century, the threat of global warming was clearly linked to the increasing\nlevels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Today, there are serious efforts to reduce consumption of all fossil fuels,\nand, in particular, to develop alternative fuels for and to increase the fuel efficiency of automobiles and trucks. In the\nU.S., federal legislation required the use of ethanol as an additive to gasoline. Ethanol can be produced from corn,\nsugar cane or other biological sources, so the use of ethanol can reduce the use of fossil fuels. This legislation led to\nthe construction of numerous facilities for producing ethanol along with substantial investment in rail lines that would\nserve the new ethanol plants. The requirement for using ethanol in gasoline created such an increase in the demand\nfor corn that the price of corn for food increased around the world - another problem that society must deal with.\nOther problems that will influence the evolution of infrastructure in the 21st century include:\n-\nAwareness that activities in one area are threatening the environment in other areas.\n-\nConcerns for energy cost may require new materials and new designs for buildings and transportation\nsystems.\n-\nSocietal norms may change, making environmental quality and sustainability much more important factors\nin evaluation factors.\n-\nSocieties may decide to devote more resources toward protection from natural disasters such as earthquakes,\ntsunamis, and hurricanes.\nThe following examples illustrate some of the problems that have emerged and some of the steps that have been taken\nto deal with them.\nActivities in one area threaten the environment in other areas: widespread use of irrigation and fertilizers were part\nof highly successful efforts to improve the yield of farms in the Midwestern U.S. Vast networks of irrigation canals\nand drainage systems were used to make it possible to farm areas that otherwise would have been too dry or too wet.\nMoreover, in order to maximize production, lands very close to waterways and wetlands were cultivated. As a result\nof these agricultural practices, excess fertilizers are washed into the rivers that feed into the Mississippi River and\neventually flow into the Gulf of Mexico, with devastating consequences.\nConcerns for energy cost influence design of buildings: as energy costs and public concerns with global warming\nrise, companies are beginning to be interested in reducing the energy required in large buildings. For example, the\nPearl River Tower in Guangzhou, China was designed to be the most energy efficient of the world's tallest skyscrapers.\nAlthough the original goal of being energy neutral proved to be too expensive, the building is expected to consume\nless than half of the energy of a similar building that was built to a traditional design.4\nAn independent, third-party rating system has been developed that certifies sustainable building practices that is used\nby many companies interested in being leaders in sustainable construction (see text box). LEED certification is\navailable for different kinds of construction, including office building, apartment buildings, schools and homes. A\ncomplex set of criteria has been established for each type of building, and points are awarded for such things as energy\nefficiency, water conservation, and landscaping. Detailed information is available from the website of the U.S. Green\nBuilding Council.\n4 Roger E. Frechette III and Russell Gilchrist, \"Seeking Zero Energy\", Civil Engineering, January 2009, pp. 38-48.\n\nLEED Certification and the Design of \"Green Buildings\"\n\"The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating SystemTM encourages\nand accelerates global adoption of sustainable green building and development practices through the\ncreation and implementation of universally understood and accepted tools and performance criteria.\n\"LEED is a third-party certification program and the nationally accepted benchmark for the design,\nconstruction and operation of high performance green buildings. LEED gives building owners and operators\nthe tools they need to have an immediate and measurable impact on their buildings' performance. LEED\npromotes a whole-building approach to sustainability by recognizing performance in five key areas of human\nand environmental health: sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection\nand indoor environmental quality.\"\nU.S. Green Building Council, www.USGBC.org\nReducing the risks of earthquakes: it is possible to build structures that are more likely to withstand earthquakes, and\nit is possible to design systems that are more likely to continue operations even if an earthquake destroys some of its\ncomponents. New buildings and other structures in earthquake zones are today designed to withstand earthquakes.\nIn many locations, structures are strengthened so that they will be more likely to withstand the lateral and vertical\nmovements that could be causes by an earthquake. In Japan, for example, where earthquakes are a very common\nexperience, JR East and other railroads retrofitted many of their bridges to reduce the risk that a high-speed train\nwould derail or overturn in the event of an earthquake. In northern California, it was decided to retrofit the Claremont\nTunnel, which was constructed in 1929 to transport water to Oakland and other cities. If a portion of this tunnel were\ndestroyed, then a half million people would be without water. To avert such a disaster, the East Bay Municipal Utility\nDistrict spent $66 million to construct a by-pass tunnel through the fault zone. The by-pass tunnel was designed to\naccommodate a lateral movement of up to 8.5 feet (2.6m).5\nSocietal norms change - the need for instant communication: Over time, as societies become more affluent, they tend\nto be less tolerant of risk, more interested in style and aesthetics, and more conscious of the factors that affect their\npersonal well-being. As a result, systems that were acceptable when built may no longer be acceptable twenty or fifty\nyears later.\nChanges in societal expectations are perhaps most notable in the area of telecommunications. In ancient history, the\nPersians, Chinese, and Romans built highways that were intended in part for armies to move quickly throughout their\nempires. The same roads were also used to provide communications between the capital cities and the other cities and\nstates that were part of the empire. In the mid-19th century, the telegraph allowed instantaneous communications -\nbut at a cost that only governments and corporations could afford on a routine basis. The telephone provided direct\ncommunication for the masses, but the cost for long distance calls was so high as to make each such call a family\nevent just 50 years ago. Cell phones freed users from their land lines, and allowed people to make calls from almost\nanywhere to almost anywhere. Today, e-mail, texting, the world-wide web, and twitter today allow people to be in\nalmost continuous contact.\nSocietal norms change - airline terminals resemble shopping malls. Travelers are no longer willing to go to the airport,\ncheck-in, and sit patiently waiting to board their plane, and they can no longer show up just before flight time, because\nof the need to pass through security. Thus, it is no longer enough to provide a few seats near the departure gates.\nMoreover, it is clear that people are willing to spend quite a lot of money when they are forced to spend a half hour\nor more in a confined area. Airports today must have restaurants, shopping opportunities, first-class lounges, internet\n5 Sarah Holtz Wilson, David F. Tsztoo, Carl R. Handford, and Kenneth Rossi, \"Safeguarding a Lifeline,\" Civil Engineering, May\n2008, pp. 58-65\n\nconnections, and attractive design; these features not only improve the comfort and quality of the traveling experience,\nthey provide income to help pay for the expansive and expensive terminals. For similar reasons, colleges today not\nonly require adequate housing for students, they also must provide excellent sports facilities and dining options and\nwireless internet connections in every classroom and in every dormitory room. The quality of the living experience\nmay be as important as the quality of the education for students deciding where to apply.\nExample: Evolution of London and the Thames Embankment\nThe Victoria Embankment was constructed in the 1860s for multiple purposes, including creation of open space along\nthe river. It also helped to channel the river and provided space for a new sewer system and an underground railway.6\nUpgrading infrastructure, coordinating major investments affecting different kinds of infrastructure, invigorating\ndowntown areas, creating more walkways to encourage pedestrians, and highlighting a city's architecture are all part\nof what is needed to create more sustainable cities.\nSt. Paul's, a magnificent structure that was constructed following the Great London Fire of 1666, was barely visible\nfrom the tourist boats plying the Thames. In 2000, a new pedestrian bridge linked the historical center of the City\nwith the rapidly re-developing South Side. Pedestrians walking across the river are now treated to an unhurried view\nof this architectural gem (Figure 1). The bridge also connects well designed walkways along the south side of the\nriver with the 19th century linear park along the north side.\nFigure 1 St. Paul's Cathedral and Millenium Bridge, London\n6 For the history of London's sewers and the construction of the embankment, see Stephen Halliday, The Great Stink of\nLondon: Sir Joseph Bazalgette and the Cleansing of the Victorian Metropolis, Sutton Publishing, Phoenix Mill, England,\n1999.\n\nExample: Building New, More Sustainable Infrastructure: One Bryant Park7\nBank of American, working with the Durst Organization, designed their 55-story headquarters so as to achieve the\nhighest level of LEED certification, thereby demonstrating their commitment to sustainable development. In order to\nbecome one of the first skyscrapers to achieve platinum certification, the new Manhattan skyscraper had to incorporate\nsustainable features that distinguish it from conventional office towers:\n-\nEnergy requirements:\no The building has a 4.6 MW natural gas-fired power plant; excess heat is used to heat hot water for\nheating the building in the winter and cooling it in the summer via an absorption chiller.\no A thermal storage plant is located in the basement that produces ice at night, when energy demand\nis low and helps with air-conditioning during the day. This reduces the building's peak energy\nrequirements, thereby lessening the demand for electricity from the most polluting and least\nefficient power plants serving the city (since these plants are only used during peak periods).\n-\nWater requirements are half that of a conventional building:\no Rail water is collected and used as grey water to flush toilets and supply the cooling system\no Waterless urinals are used in all men's restrooms, saving three million gallons per year\n-\nInterior design is healthier than a conventional building:\no The interior incorporated many recycled materials and avoided materials with volatile organic\ncompounds.\no The heating and ventilation systems filter out 95% of the airborne particulates, compared to 35%\nfor a conventional building; the air discharged from the building is cleaner than when it entered.\no The glass-shrouded building lets in natural light\n-\nUse of recycled materials in the structure\no The 25,000 tons of structural steel had at least 75% recycled content.\no 45% of the cement used in the building was granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), a waste product\nof steel smelting that produces a stronger, denser, and more durable concrete. Use of GBFS was\nestimated to reduce material waste and new cement by 17,000 tons each, while also reducing the\nemission of carbon dioxide by nearly 16,000 tons.\no The construction process resulted in less debris and less need for recycling.\n-\nIntegration within the city:\no An underground pedestrian walkway will eventually connect subway stations on the north and\nsouth sides of the site and a mid-block subway entrance will eventually be added.\no The tower's entrances are sited to enhance access to Bryant Park.\no The project helped in the reconstruction of Henry Miller's Theatre, a playhouse located on a corner\nof the site.\nThe $1.3-billion building includes 2.2 million square feet of office space, most of which was initially occupied by\nBank of America beginning in 2008. In addition to its sustainability, the iconic building is noted for its beauty, as it\n\"features crisp folds that appear to be sculpted and precise vertical lines animated by the movement of the sun, the\nclouds, and the moon.\"\nIt is clear from this example that it is possible to build high-rise buildings that are much more sustainable in terms of\ntheir materials requirements, their energy and water needs, the quality of the indoor environment, and their integration\n7 Andrew Mueller-Lust, Crystal Clear, Civil Engineering, December 2008, pp. 38-71. The tower is owned by One Bryant Park,\nLLP; it was developed by the Durst Organization; and Band of America is the largest tenant. The architect of record was Adamson\nAssociates Consulting Engineers, P.C.\n\nwith the nearby urban environment. Whether the innovations used in One Bryant Park will be cost-effective in other\napplications is something that designers will have to determine for other locations and for other building projects.\nStage VIII Retrenching and Obsolescence\nCompetition and changes in societal needs will cause some systems to shrink and perhaps disappear. If well-managed,\na system can decline slowly, over a matter of decades, by continually eliminating unnecessary or unprofitable\ncomponents and cutting back to profitable core operations. If poorly managed, a system may simply hold on for too\nlong, then suddenly collapse. Today, there is an on-going drama involving telecommunications. Are land-lines\nobsolete? Will everyone go wireless? Will people communicate only via the internet? What will happen to all of\nthose telephone poles?\nAs with the previous stages, many of the standard methodologies of project evaluation will be useful in deciding\nwhether or not a system or technology is obsolescing and, if so, figuring out how to age gracefully. Short-sighted\nmanagement may fail to foresee problems until it is too late to do anything; bull-headed managers may decide to invest\nvast sums to rehabilitate a system that is actually no longer competitive. Some of the largest expenditures on rail\npassenger stations were made in the 1930s, just at the time when air travel and automobiles were about to put most\nrail passenger services out of business. It is far better to have a realistic outlook on competition than to blindly go\nahead with major investments aimed at providing marginal improvements to a system that is more than marginally\nnon-competitive.\n21st Century Challenges: Sustainable Infrastructure\nTechnological changes can, over time, dramatically affect the way that infrastructure is designed, how it is used, and\nhow it impacts society. For skyscrapers, railroads, and other types of infrastructure, technology has allowed great\nreductions in cost, but regulation has been required to curb private sector excesses related to pricing, aesthetics, over\nbuilding, or safety. Skyscrapers and railroads today are more energy efficient, more attuned to user needs, and more\nsustainable that they were 50 or 100 years ago. Presumably both types of infrastructure will continue to evolve in\nresponse to social, economic, financial, and environmental pressures.\nToday, the need to consider sustainability is much more evident than it was in the 19th century at the height of the\nindustrial revolution. The impetus to consider sustainability comes from various sources:\n-\nOver-dependence upon fossil fuels.\n-\nGlobal warming and related aspects of climate change: more severe weather patterns, rising sea-levels,\nthreats to ecosystems.\n-\nSocietal concerns with equity and social justice: the vast difference in quality of life in different countries\nand the vast inequality in incomes among the richest and poorest within each country.\n-\nInstability in many societies related to disintegrating economies, internal conflicts, and lack of opportunity.\n-\nCongestion and pollution within the largest cities: are there limits to growth? What can be done to improve\nquality of life in mega-cities, especially in developing countries?\n-\nCracks in the automobile culture: recognition of the disproportionate amount of resources devoted to\nautomobiles and highways, the enormous loss of life on highways, the dependence upon fossil fuels, the\ncontribution to green-house gases, and the waste of time and resources caused by urban congestion.\n-\nEnvironmental degradation, including an accelerated rate of extinction of species, loss of habitat, the long\nterm threat of toxic chemicals to the water supply, and erosion.\nThese factors will influence how infrastructure performance is measured, how goals are established, how problems\nare defined and how project and programs are evaluated in the 21st century. However, the same multi-objective\nframework for evaluating infrastructure projects will remain useful, even if the relative importance of cost,\nenvironmental quality, sustainability change dramatically. Financial analysis will remain important, because an\nessential aspect of sustainable infrastructure will always be the ability to raise the cash to pay for construction,\n\nmaintenance, and operation, and the ability to raise cash ultimately will reflect what is going on in the financial\nmarkets. The ability to deal with uncertainty and risks, the ability of the public and private sectors to work together,\nand the ability to manage projects and program will all continue to be essential aspects of the development and\nevolution of infrastructure systems.\nEnhancing the sustainability of infrastructure will be a continuing challenge for planners, engineers, and politicians in\nthe 21st century. Urban problems related to pollution, congestion, disease, water supply, wastes, and natural disasters\nwill grow, especially in mega-cities in developing countries, but also in all large or rapidly growing metropolitan\nareas. Battles over water supply will intensify, and the needs for waste water treatment will increase. Renewable\nenergy sources will need to be developed to lessen dependence upon fossil fuels, and safer, more efficient, more secure\nsystems will be needed for greatly expanding the role for nuclear energy. It will be necessary to transform\ntransportation and land use patterns that were developed over decades when oil was cheap, highways were easy to\nbuild, and cities were forsaken. Massive efforts will be needed to create or protect the world's green infrastructure\nand to reverse some of mankind's worst encroachments on harbors, waterways, wetlands, and threatened ecosystems.\nResponses to these challenges will include efforts in many different areas:\n-\nManaging the demands on infrastructure.\n-\nMaintaining and rehabilitating existing infrastructure.\n-\nManaging infrastructure more effectively.\n-\nUsing infrastructure more effectively.\n-\nMitigating the negative social and environmental impacts of existing infrastructure.\n-\nBuilding new, more sustainable infrastructure.\n-\nRetiring old, unsustainable infrastructure.\nIn any of these areas, success will depend upon the same factors that have been emphasized throughout this collection\nof essays and case studies:\n-\nClear identification of the problems.\n-\nDevelopment of objectives and measurable criteria.\n-\nGenerating possible alternatives for dealing with the problems.\n-\nAnalyzing alternatives with respect to financial, economic, social an environmental impacts.\n-\nSelecting and refining the most promising projects and programs.\n-\nImplementing projects and programs efficiently and effectively.\n-\nMonitoring performance and taken actions as necessary to achieve the objectives of the project.\nThe evolution of infrastructure depends to some extent on leadership, innovation, technologies, and regulation. Efforts\nto transform infrastructure do not happen overnight, and it may take time for society to recognize either the need for\nchanges or the need to regulate development. Once the technology for high rise construction was available, real estate\neconomics quickly drove buildings skyward in Chicago and New York; however, only after several decades of\nunfettered development, were city authorities able to institute zoning regulations to preserve light and air quality by\nrequiring setbacks as the towers rose from street level. The rail industry struggled for nearly a century to transform\nitself from its role as the dominant transport mode of the late19th century to a well-managed niche player with potential\nfor growth at the beginning of the 21st.\n\nSummary\nMost infrastructure projects are completed as an extension to, as an upgrade of, or as a competitor to an existing\nsystem. Infrastructure projects therefore are almost always conceived and evaluated in the context of existing systems.\nAt times, perhaps for very long periods of time, there will be very clear projects that can and should be implemented\nwith little or no controversy and with little or no need for extensive analysis. Projects that improve the performance\nof a successful system or projects that replicate systems in new locations may not require a great deal of specialized\nevaluation, because the costs and benefits associated with such projects are well understood. However, over time,\nchanges in technology, institutions, political power, economic conditions or societal norms will lead to new ideas for\nprojects, new estimates of the potential costs and benefits of projects, and new criteria for evaluating projects.\nIt is useful to consider the stages in the evolution of an infrastructure-based project, for the opportunities and problems\nare different in each stage. Table 3 lists some of the questions that are to be encountered in each of the seven stages\nof evolution that have been discussed in this essay. These stages are not necessarily sequential, and different parts of\na large system may well be at different stages of development. For example, the infrastructure required to support\ncell phones and other wireless communications is still in the early stages of evolution, while the infrastructure used to\nsupport traditional land-line telephones is in the latter stages of evolution - even though the same companies may be\ninvolved in both types of communication.\nOver time, society's needs and resources change, and as they change, the roles for and perceptions of infrastructure\nwill also change. In the 19th and 20th centuries, new technologies and mammoth infrastructure projects enhanced\nmobility, helped make agriculture more productive, allowed more intensive urban development, provided heat and\nlight, and shrank the world, together creating unprecedented prosperity and a global economy, While many of the\nconsequences of these technologies and project have been highly beneficial, there have also been negative\nconsequences, including pollution, over-dependence upon non-renewable energy sources, congestion, excessive use\nof water, inequalities in development, and degradation of the environment. In the 21st century, much of the interest in\ninfrastructure will be aimed at resolving these problems and extending the benefits of modern technology to all regions\nof the world. Many projects and programs will need to be initiated in order to move the U.S. and the world toward\nmore sustainable infrastructure.\nEfforts to create more sustainable infrastructure will likewise takes decades of steady progress. While examples\nabound to illustrate how different systems are evolving, it is unclear which approaches will be most successful and\nwhich will ultimately be found to be too costly, too inefficient, or ineffective.\n\nTable 3 Stages in the Evolution of Infrastructure-Based Systems\nI\nTechnological Experimentation and Demonstration\n-\nWill the technology work?\n-\nWill investors support projects?\n-\nWill there be a market for the new technology?\n-\nWill public agencies approve the new technology?\nII\nWide-Spread, Uncoordinated Implementation\n-\nWhat will be needed to implement the new technology?\n-\nWho can build the fastest?\n-\nWhose approach will be the best?\n-\nWhat is needed to obtain public approval for new or expanded systems?\nIII\nDevelopment of Systems\n-\nHow can we achieve economies of scale and density?\n-\nWhat organizational structure is best?\n-\nHow much coordination is required among government agencies and developers or\nprivate companies?\n-\nWhat is the best way to handle growth?\n-\nHow can we avoid overbuilding?\nIV\nConsolidation and Rationalization\n-\nHow can we rationalize the system so as to become more efficient and more effective\nin providing services?\n-\nWhat is the optimal structure of our system?\nV\nTechnological and Institutional Advancement\n-\nWhat is the source of competition: similar systems, different technologies that\nprovide the same service, or systems that eliminate the need for the existing service?\n-\nWhat is the role for new technology?\n-\nHow can the system be managed and regulated more effectively?\nVI\nResponding to Competition\n-\nWhat is the best role for the system?\n-\nCan the system survive competition?\nVII\nMitigating Social and Environmental Impacts\n-\nHow can the system respond to changes in societal views of the role of the system and\nthe nature of its impacts on society and the environment?\n-\nHow can negative social and environmental externalities be mitigated?\nVIII\nRetrenching and Obsolescence\n-\nWhen is it necessary to downsize?\n-\nWhat is the best approach to downsizing?\n-\nHow can the system be re-used, recycled, or dismantled?\n\nCase Study\nThe Franconia Notch Parkway\nSometimes the best solution requires a compromise that results in a project that is more limited than\nwhat proponents wanted to build, but enables the project to be accepted by the general public. When\nInterstate 93 was first planned for central New Hampshire, the Federal Highway Department insisted\nupon using standard design criteria, namely a four-lane divided highway with few exits. However,\nthe proposed project would have obliterated the central portion of Franconia Notch, the flagship of\nNew Hampshire's state park system, causing great consternation with the public and local\nconservation organizations. After much discussion, FHWA backed down, and the damage to the park\nwas avoided by upgrading the existing two-lane highway and limiting the width of the right-of-way\nwithin the most environmentally sensitive areas of Franconia Notch.\nEnvironmental issues can be easy to understand or very complex, and they can generate dramatic controversy.\nFranconia Notch, illustrated in Figures 1and 2, is one of the most beautiful spots in the White Mountains of New\nHampshire. Most of the area visible in the photos is part of Franconia Notch State Park, which includes a swimming\nbeach, an aerial tramway to the summit of Cannon Mountain, ski trails, and hiking trails. The Notch is also the\nhistorical route for traveling between southern New Hampshire and northern Vermont - and therefore the natural route\nfor an interstate highway. The route was indeed part of the original plan for Route I93, but controversies arose\nconcerning how to fit the standard four-lane divided interstate highway into what little room is available between the\nLafayette range on the east (the left side of the pictures) and the Kinsman range to the west. One plan developed by\nhighway planners was to blast a tunnel through Mt. Skookumchuck (the rocky outcrop at the head of the notch that is\nclearly visible in the middle of the picture) so that the four-lane divided highway could plow straight through the\nnotch. This plan would have obliterated two small ponds, cut off much of Echo Lake (the lovely lake visible in the\nphoto that is used extensively for swimming and fishing) and taken up nearly all of the flat land available in the upper\nportions of this narrow valley.\nLocal opposition prevented this option and all other attempts to build a highway to interstate specifications through\nthe notch. The public's interest in the project was represented by the Appalachian Mountain Club, whose members\nmaintained and hiked the many trails in these mountains, and the Society for Preservation of New Hampshire Forests,\nwhich had purchased this land more than 80 years ago and contributed it to New Hampshire for use as a state park.\nThese two organizations worked with the NH Department of Transportation to find a less intrusive solution that\npreserved more of the park yet allowed better transportation. Instead of the typical interstate, the existing road was\nenhanced, but not widened, and a better link was thereby made between the sections of I93 that were completed north\nand south of Franconia Notch. Since the new road had only a 45 mph speed limit and narrowed to a single lane in\neach direction for several miles, it was clearly not up to interstate standards. Moreover, it had frequent exits for access\nto the Notch's attractions, including the viewing spot for the much loved but recently collapsed Old Man of the\nMountain - a striking rock formation that is now visible only in photos and on the obverse of the New Hampshire\nquarter (the only US coin with two heads). For many years, the Federal Highway Administration refused to classify\nthe road as an interstate, and it was officially known as the Franconia Notch Parkway. FHWA eventually relented\nand, early in the 21st century, the Franconia Notch Parkway officially became part of the interstate system, despite its\nobvious deficiencies. Today, the stretch of road visible in these photographs is the only two-lane portion of the entire\nInterstate Highway System. The compact between NH DOT and the two conservation groups remains in place. These\nthree parties worked together in 2009 to develop plans for resurfacing the roadway, repairing drainage, replacing\nguardrails, improving the landscaping, and keeping the small footprint of the highway unchanged. The compromise\ndecision to allow a slimmed-down interstate highway to be constructed through this scenic region was an early\nexample of what is now referred to as context sensitive design. Considerable environmental disruption can be\navoided by tailoring infrastructure to the local geography and environmental conditions instead of insisting upon the\nuse of standard procedures.\n\nFigure 1 Franconia Notch, with Mount Lafayette in the distance,\nSkookumchuck in the left center, and Echo Lake in the lower right.\nA road built to interstate standards would have destroyed much of the scenic sites within Franconia Notch State\nPark. However, a two-lane road provides sufficient capacity for this rural portion of the interstate, and it has little\nimpact on the state park. This road, completed in 1983, is an early example of what is now called \"context sensitive\ndesign.\"\nFigure 2 Franconia Notch Parkway at the edge of Echo Lake\nThis narrow, but highly scenic two-lane road is now part of Interstate 93. This picture, which was taken on the same\nday as the previous picture, shows how little space is taken up by the highway as it skirts the shoreline of a lake and a\nvalley that are famous for their recreational opportunities: swimming, fishing, hiking, biking and snowmobiling.\n\nCase Study\nWeighting Schemes for Evaluating Options for Increasing Bus Capacity\nWeighting schemes cannot be accepted as an objective way to compare alternatives. This\nhypothetical case study illustrates how each group interested in expanding the capacity of a transit\nsystem can devise a weighting scheme that will rate their preferred option as the best option.\nTable 1 shows how four hypothetical options for improving the performance of a bus system might affect various\naspects of performance. The system currently has 300 buses, some of which are old and inefficient. Strategies for\nimproving performance of the system include buying new buses, creating a busway within the downtown area in order\nto allow buses to avoid congestion, and developing a control system that would improve performance by enabling\ndispatchers to monitor the location of and the number of people on every bus. Buying new buses would have two\neffects: increasing the number of scheduled operations, thereby improving service and allowing the system to handle\nmore passengers. With new buses, the oldest 25 buses could be retired, and the average fuel efficiency of the fleet\nwould increase while the average emissions would decline. If new buses were purchased, it would be possible to\nreduce emissions by ordering cleaner, but more expensive, hybrid buses. If more buses were acquired, the agency\nplanned to create a new servicing facility for the buses on land that the agency owns; several businesses that currently\nrent space from the transit agency would have to be moved from this site. If the city were to build a busway and create\nsome bus-only lanes, it would be able to provide much faster service and run additional trips without increasing the\nsize of the fleet. Finally, if the city were to install a state-of-the-art control system, it would be able to get some\nimprovement in travel times, ridership, and emissions for a much lower cost than any of the other options.\nTable 1 Predicted Cost and Performance for Expanding Capacity of a Bus System\nCost\nImprovement in\nTravel Times\nIncrease in\nRidership\nReduction in\nEmissions per\nBus-Mile\nFamilies &\nBusinesses\nto Relocate\nBuy 100 new buses\n$50 million\n5%\n20%\n10%\nBuy 75 new hybrid\nbuses\n$60 million\n4%\n15%\n40%\nCreate a busway\n$200 million\n20%\n30%\n8%\nInstall a control\nsystem\n$20 million\n10%\n5%\n5%\nNone of the proposals dominates all of the others, and three of the proposals look best in terms of at least one of the\ncriteria. Buying hybrids provides the greatest reduction in emissions, while creating a busway would lead to the\ngreatest increase in ridership and installing a control system would be the least costly. Table 2 shows how the\nproposals rank by each criteria. These are call ordinal rankings: first, second, third, or fourth. The total column\nsimply adds the five numbers, so that it is a measure that weights each of the criteria equally. If the best option is the\none with the lowest total, then the best option would be to buy 100 new buses.\nTable 2 Summing Ordinal Rankings for Each Criterion to Obtain an Overall Ranking\nCost\nImprovement in\nTravel Times\nIncrease in\nRidership\nReduction in\nEmissions per\nBus-Mile\nFamilies &\nBusinesses\nto Relocate\nTotal\nBuy 100 new buses\nBuy 75 new hybrid\nbuses\nCreate a busway\nInstall a control\nsystem\n\nIt is unlikely that any group of planners or financial managers or government officials or public interest groups would\nsimply accept this result. Those who really want the busway, such as the Transit Agency's Strategic Planning Group,\nmight argue that capacity and ridership are the main goals. They might propose weighting travel time and ridership\nthree times as heavily as the other criteria. As shown in Table 3, creating a busway now looks best.\nTable 3 Weighting Scheme Proposed by the Transit Strategic Planning Group\nCost\nImprovement in\nTravel Times\nIncrease in\nRidership\nReduction in\nEmissions per\nBus-Mile\nFamilies &\nBusinesses to\nRelocate\nTotal\nWeight:\nBuy 100 new buses\n3x3\n2x3\nBuy 75 new hybrid\nbuses\n4x3\n3x3\nCreate a busway\n1x3\n1x3\nInstall a control\nsystem\n2x3\n4x3\nThe operators and the bus passengers association, who really want some immediate relief from overcrowded,\nunreliable buses, support the concept of bus lanes and busways, but what they most want is new buses. They point\nout that the busway will take three years to complete, and they also wonder why it should be possible to get hundreds\nof millions for capital improvements when budgets have been so tight that it has been necessary to freeze salaries for\nmanagers and raise fares. The General Manager of Bus Operations argues for high weighting only for cost and\nridership, which he views as the key factors, and he claims that relocating small businesses who rented space is not an\nissue, as those businesses knew very well that their building would eventually be needed for the bus servicing facility.\nHe therefore argued for a revised set of weights as shown in Table 4.\nTable 4 Weighting Scheme Proposed by the General Manager of Bus Operations\nCost\nImprovement in\nTravel Times\nIncrease in\nRidership\nReduction in\nEmissions per\nBus-Mile\nFamilies &\nBusinesses\nto Relocate\nTotal\nWeight:\nBuy 100 new buses\n2x2\n2x2\n2x0\nBuy 75 new hybrid\nbuses\n3x2\n3x2\n2x0\nCreate a busway\n4x2\n1x2\n3x0\nInstall a control\nsystem\n1x2\n4x2\n1x0\nThe local environmental groups, who are a major political force in the city, push very hard that investing in clean\nbuses would have a dramatic impact on the air quality of the city. Furthermore, they argue that the city should set a\nhigh standard when it comes to cleaning up the environment. They say that the city should buy however many hybrid\nbuses it can afford to establish a long-term commitment to improving the environment. They also dislike the ranking\nscheme as structured in all of the above charts, as some of the differences among options are small, while others are\nvery high. They recommend normalizing each of the measures by dividing by the measure for the best option for each\ncriteria where a lower number is better and using the inverse when a higher number is better. Hence, the hybrid bus\ncost of $60 million would be divided by $20 million, the cost of the lowest cost option, to get a value of 3 for the cost\ncriteria. The hybrid bus value of 40% reduction in emissions is in fact the best, so dividing 40% by 40% would give\na value of 1 for the hybrid buses reduction in emissions. They also agree with the notion that there would be no real\nrelocations caused by the creation of the bus servicing facility, so they simply dropped that criteria. Finally, they\ninterpreted the use of weights to be merely an exercise in promoting special interests; once the relevant criteria have\nbeen identified, they weight everything equally. Their proposed ranking is shown in Table 5.\n\nTable 5 Weighting Scheme Proposed by Environmental Groups\nCost\nImprovement in\nTravel Times\nIncrease in\nRidership\nReduction in\nEmissions per\nBus-Mile\nTotal\nWeight:\nBuy 100 new buses\n50/20 = 2.5\n20%/5% = 4\n30%/20% = 1.5\n40%/10% = 4\nBuy 75 new hybrid\nbuses\n60/20 = 3\n20%/4% = 5\n30%/15% = 2\n40%/40% =1\nCreate a busway\n200/20 = 10\n20%/20% = 1\n30%/30% = 1\n40%/8% = 5\nInstall a control\nsystem\n20/20 = 1\n20%/10% =2\n30%/5% =6\n40%/5% = 8\nNote that the participants in this example were not debating the information that they were given. They did not dispute\nthe costs of the proposed systems, the ability of each system to improve service or capacity, or the effect of improved\nservice and higher capacity on ridership or emissions. Anyone who has been involved in evaluating such competing\nprojects knows that there could well be extended debates about any or all of these matters. Still, even though all of\nthe participants accepted the predictions of cost and impacts, it was possible to devise a scheme to make any one of\nthe choices look the best.\nThere is a clear lesson from this case study. It is at best very difficult and more likely impossible to define a \"correct\"\nweighting scheme when there are competing options, multiple objectives, and differences in priorities among those\nwho participate in making the decision. The best that can be done is to use some sort of participatory process to reach\na consensus as to the weights that are used and the rankings that result. Extreme weights and contorted measurement\nschemes will be apparent to the majority of a diverse group of people, so if the measurement schemes and weighting\noptions are presented fairly and subjected to general discussion, there will be some hope for reaching consensus.\nFigure 1 South Station Bus Terminal,\nBoston\nThe bus terminal was constructed in the\n1990s in order to replace an old, entirely\ninadequate terminal that was poorly\nlocated with respect to the subway system\nand the train stations. The new inter-city\nterminal was built right next to South\nStation, where it provides for easy\nconnections with both transit and intercity\nrail.\n\nThe Panama Canal\nThe construction of the Panama Canal was one of the great engineering feats of the 20th century,\nculminating centuries of efforts to create more efficient transportation routes across this rain-\nsoaked isthmus between the Atlantic and the Pacific. The case therefore begins with the 16th\ncentury search for routes from Europe to the Pacific, and it describes the development of roads\nand railroads as well as the eventual construction of the Panama Canal. The case also identifies\nthe challenges facing the canal at the beginning of the 21st century, when the need for expanding\ncapacity conflicted with heightened concerns for the environment and for social responsibility.\nEarly Routes Across the Isthmus\nColumbus, sailing west in hopes of opening a trade route between Europe and Asia, instead ran into the Americas.\nWhile promising in terms of future development and precious metals, the Americas were not accepted as the limits of\nSpanish interest. The ultimate goal remained opening up a trade route to the civilizations of Asia.\nBalboa, in 1516, was the first to establish a freight route across the isthmus. Having \"discovered\" the Pacific Ocean,\nwith help from the local Indians, he of course wanted to continue his explorations. To do this, he needed to build ships\non the Pacific side of the isthmus, and the trees required for the task grew only on the Atlantic side.\nThe terribly onerous labor of collecting the material and carrying it on their backs to its destination was imposed\nupon the Indians, of whom thousands were gathered together for the purpose, and impelled to the unaccustomed\nwork by the merciless severity of their taskmasters. Many months were consumed in this grim struggle for a\npassage of the Isthmus, which, in many respects, foreshadowed the endeavors of the modern successors of these\nhardy pioneers. Hundreds of the wretched aborigines, Las Casas says their number fell little short of two\nthousand, lost their lives in the undertaking, but it succeeded, and four brigantines were carried piecemeal from\nsea to sea and put together on the Pacific coast.1\nBalboa's efforts were, for him at least, for naught; before he could depart on his expedition, he was tried, convicted,\nand executed on trumped-up charges by the jealous Spanish governor of the region. While exploration by sea was put\non hold, the need for a \"permanent highway to take the place of the Indian trails which were poorly adapted to the\ntraffic which had now begun to move over them became apparent.\"2 With great difficulty, a paved road wide enough\nfor two carts was constructed in 1521 linking Old Panama on the Pacific with Nombre de Dios on the Atlantic. After\nabout 10 years, the use of the route was modified to an intermodal route, with light sailing vessels leaving from\nNombre de Dios and sailing up the Chagres in order to meet up with the road. By the end of the 16th century, the\nAtlantic terminus of the cross-isthmus road was shifted to Porto Bello. By then, this road was the \"richest highway in\nthe world\", as it was the critical link between the Atlantic and Old Panama (the \"most important Spanish City in the\nNew World\"), the mines of Peru, and the major regional fairs in Cartagena and Porto Bello.3\nThe Spanish continued to look for an all water route to the orient. In 1519, Magellan found the southern route to the\nPacific, passing through the Straits of Tierra del Fuego. In 1522, using Balboa's vessels, Gil Gonzales sailed north,\nlooking for a waterway, and eventually found Lake Nicaragua; in 1529, Diego Machuca explored the Lake and, with\ndifficulty, navigated the San Juan River from the Lake to the Atlantic. Over the next century, this became an important\ncommercial route for \"vessels making ports in Spain, the West Indies and South America ... for more than a hundred\nyears, a constant stream of gold, pearls, and other products of Spain's island possessions flowed across the Isthmus.\"4\n1 Marshall, Logan, The Story of the Panama Canal, L.T. Meyers, 1913, p. 19.\n2 Marshall, op. cit., pp. 19-20.\n3 Marshall, op. cit., pp. 20-21.\n4 Marshall, op. cit., p. 19.\n\nAbout this time Cortes established a transcontinental trade route across Mexico, from the mouth of the Coatzacoalcos\nRiver to the port of Tehuantepec on the Pacific, which was used as a trade route between Spain and the Americas as\nwell as a link to the Philippines.\nMilitary considerations put plans for a water route on hold. Philip the Second feared that a water route across the\nisthmus would simply give enemies easy access to Spain's new possessions. This policy lasted for two centuries. In\nthe late 1700s, the possibility of a canal along the Cortes route was investigated by Manuel Galisteo. Although his\nconclusion was unfavorable, British engineers accompanying Galisteo felt the project was feasible. When war broke\nout with Spain, the British sent Captain Horatio Nelson to the region, who viewed his mission as follows:\nIn order to give facility to the great object of the government I intend to possess the Lake of Nicaragua, which for\nthe present, may be looked upon as the inland Gibraltar of Spanish America. As it commands the only water pass\nbetween the oceans, its situation must ever render it a principal post to insure passage to the Southern Ocean,\nand by our possession of it, Spanish America is divided in two.5\nNelson and his men indeed grabbed control of Lake Nicaragua, but climate and illness forced them out, and Spain\nretained control of the \"canal region\" at the beginning of the 19th century. New investigations by Humboldt generated\ninterest in a canal, and in 1814 Spain passed legislation authorizing the construction of a canal. Before any work could\nbegin, revolutions in South and Central America overthrew the Spanish dominance and\n... opened up new possibilities in connection with the much-mooted question of a waterway and claimed the\nattention of capitalists and statesmen of all the commercial nations. From this time the matter is taken up with\ndefiniteness of purpose and never allowed to rest.6\nThe United States officially became interested in 1825, when Secretary of State Henry Clay entered into negotiations\nwith the Republic of Central America for building a canal across Nicaragua \"the execution of which ... will form a\ngreat epoch in the commercial affairs of the whole world.\"7\nIn 1827, the Colombia commissioned J.A. Lloyd to study possible rail and water routes across the Isthmus of Panama.\nLloyd considered plans for a canal to be premature and instead recommended an intermodal route combining water\nand rail to take the place of inadequate roads.\nIn 1838, a French company obtained a concession from what was now New Granada to construct highways, canals,\nor railroads from Panama to the Atlantic, by any feasible route. The pressure and interest was growing, but the\ndifficulties were not yet well understood, and the costs of construction were greatly underestimated by all parties\ninvolved.\nFrom the perspective of the United States, the strategic importance of the Isthmus changed immensely when California\nwas acquired in 1848 as a result of the war with Mexico:\n\"The requirements of travel and commerce demanded better methods of transportation between the Eastern States\nand the Pacific coast, but there were other reasons of a more public character for bringing these sections into\ncloser communication. The establishment and maintenance of army posts and naval stations in the newly acquired\nand settled regions in the Far West, the extension of mail facilities to the inhabitants, and the discharge of other\ngovernmental functions, all required a connection in the shortest time and at the least distance that was possible\nand practicable. The importance of this connection was so manifest that the Government was aroused to actions\nbefore all the enumerated causes had come into operation, and negotiations were entered into with the Republic\n5 Marshall, op. cit. p. 25.\n6 Marshall, op. cit. p. 27.\n7 Marshall, op. cit. p. 28.\n\nof New Granada to secure a right of transit across the Isthmus of Panama.\"8 [Report of the Isthmian Canal\nCommission. Washington, 1899-1901, cited in Marshall, p. 34].\nA treaty was ratified with New Granada in 1848 for the Panama route in 1848. In 1849, a treaty was ratified with\nNicaragua to allow construction of railroads, highways, or canals across Nicaragua. For many years thereafter, it\nappeared most likely that the United States, if it did build a railroad or canal, would choose the Nicaraguan route. And\nPresident Grant ensured the world that the United States was indeed interested in building a canal when he stated that\n\"To Europeans, the benefits of and advantages of the proposed canal are great; to Americans they are incalculable.\"\nThe Panama Railroad\nThe idea of a railroad across Panama remained just that until the discovery of gold in California vastly increased the\ndemand for transportation across the Isthmus. After earlier concessions expired without producing any construction,\nNew Granada granted the railway concession to the Panama Railroad Company, which was incorporated in 1849 with\nstrong financial backing from Wall Street. The concession gave the company a railroad monopoly across the isthmus\nand allowed it to sell its assets at a fair price to any company that was authorized to build a canal (since a canal, once\nbuilt, would likely destroy the railroad, both financially and literally).\nThe benefits of a railroad were clear. For passengers, the railroad, once built, would cut the transit time across the\nisthmus from a hazardous five to ten days to a relatively luxurious couple of hours. For freight, the time savings were\neven greater, as months could be saved by not going around Cape Horn. For a trip from New York to San Francisco,\nthe all water route was 13,000 miles, whereas the intermodal route via the Panama Railroad would be only 5,000\nmiles, a savings of 8,000 miles.\nThe engineering work for the railroad began in 1849, and construction was estimated to require two years and a cost\nof less than $2 million.9 In fact, the first train operated across the 48-mile broad gauge10 line in 1855 and the\nconstruction cost was more than $8 million, six times the initial estimates. In addition, the railroad acknowledged\nmore than 1,200 fatalities in the work force, which averaged 5,000 men over the five years of construction. More\nlikely, there were more than 6,000 fatalities from disease.11\nThe railroad was a financial success, with profits of 12 to 22% per year, i.e. $1 to $2 million annually. The railroad\nalso reshaped the economic geography of Panama, as Colon, at the terminus of the railroad, replaced Porto Bello as\nthe major Atlantic port. The financial success was to be expected given the potential for the railroad to capture the\nlion's share of the benefits of not having to ship around South America or to trek through the jungles of Panama.\nPassengers were quite happy to pay the fare of $25, and there were 40,000 passengers per year from 1856 to 1966.12\nShippers were also willing to pay a bill that might be nearly as much per ton:\nWith the opening of the railroad, a large traffic across the isthmus sprang into existence and grew rapidly with\nthe advance of time. The products of Asia and the countries upon the Pacific coast were carried [on the railroad]\nfrom Panama to Colon, there to be distributed amongst steamships making the ports of Europe, Canada, the\nUnited States and the West Indies. Moving in the reverse direction, goods from these countries reached, by the\nsame trans-isthmian route, South and Central America and San Francisco. From the last named port, reshipment\nwas made to the Pacific islands and points on the Asian mainland. A number of steamship lines made regular\n8 Report of the Isthmian Canal Commission. Washington, 1899-1901, cited in Marshall, p. 34.\n9 McCullough, David, The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914, Simon and Schuster, New\nYork, 1977, p. 34.\n10 Gauge is the distance between the rails. Broad gauge, at five feet, is slightly wider than the standard rail gauge of 4 feet 8.5\ninches, which reputedly can be traced back to the gauge of wagons used in Roman times. The persistence of the standard gauge\nfrom ancient times reflected the need for wagons to fit the ruts found in dirt and gravel roads.\n11 McCullough, op. cit., p. 37\n12 McCullough, op. cit., pp. 35-36.\n\ncalls at the terminal ports of the railroad. The line occupied a commanding position as the essential link in this\nchain of traffic, and took full advantage of the fact. Its charges were exorbitant and its profits enormous for many\nyears. Its rates were based on, in general, fifty per cent of the through tariff. For instance, of the total cost of\nshipping goods from New York to Valparaiso [in Chile], one half represented the charge of the railroad company\nfor its share of the carriage. For many years the road carried enormous quantities of coffee to Europe. The\nthrough rate was about thirty dollars per ton. The railroad company received fifteen dollars and the two steamship\ncompanies that handled the goods divided a similar sum. 13\nIn its first six years of operation, the Panama Railroad had cumulative profits of more than $7 million, nearly recouping\nthe entire construction cost. At one point, the stock price of the Panama Railroad Company reached $295 per share,\nthe highest on the NY Stock Exchange for a market valuation of $21 million and an indication to potential investors\nof the financial possibilities of a transcontinental connection.14 In 1879, the railroad was offered for sale to the [French]\nPanama Canal Company for $14 million; 6/7 of the stock of the company was eventually sold to the Panama Canal\nCompany for $18.6 million.15\nWhen the United States took over the construction of the Canal from the French in 1904, it acquired the railroad as\nwell. Shippers took the change in ownership as an opportunity to challenge the monopolistic pricing practices of the\nrailroad. For example, the railroad had a contract that gave the Pacific Mail Steamship Company the exclusive right\nto issue through bills of lading from San Francisco to New York; all other steamship lines would have to pay full fare\nfor the local rail move. When the US took over, the monopolistic rates were replaced with rates designed only to\nprovide a fair rate of return over costs.16 This change in pricing policy ended the period of independent prosperity for\nthe railroad.\nHowever, the Panama Railroad's finest hour was yet to come. To construct the canal required the extensive use of\nthe railroad, but the railroad first had to be moved, since much of it would otherwise be flooded by the creation of\nLake Gatun, a critical step in the construction. The cost of the new, double track line was $8.9 million, i.e. roughly\nthe same as the cost of the original line. During the height of the canal construction, the line handled 700 to 800 dirt\ntrains daily, each consisting of a locomotive and 18 flat cars with a total load of 500 tons. The peak year was 1910,\nwhen the line moved approximately 300 million tons of freight, a truly phenomenal amount that is roughly 20% of\nthe record levels of tonnage handled by the entire US rail system (first during World War II, but not again until the\nlate 1990s). Despite tremendous technological advances in both track and equipment, even the highest density lines\nin the United States (and in the world) carried only half that amount of tonnage at the beginning of the 21st century.17\nThe French Effort\nThe first serious effort to construct a trans-isthmian canal was initiated by the Panama Canal Company, a French\ncompany headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, the man who had conceived, organized, and completed the construction of\nthe Suez Canal. A number of engineering conferences had been held to debate the route, the nature of the canal, and\nthe resources required. Panama was the route favored by de Lesseps, who also insisted on a sea-level canal. The\nconstruction time for and the cost of constructing the canal were variously estimated as two years and $100 million\n(by a contractor eager to do the job), eight years and $168 million by a national technical commission, and twelve\nyears and $214 million by the Paris Congress. De Lesseps, in promoting the project, chose a figure of $131 million.\nThe canal was clearly going to be much more expensive than the railroad!\nDe Lesseps estimated the first year's traffic as 6 million tons, which would assure revenue of $18 million (at $3 per\nton). Since a sea-level canal would have low operating costs, most of the toll revenue would be expected to be profit.\n13 Marshall, op. cit., pp. 52-53.\n14 McCullough, op. cit., pp. 35-36.\n15 Marshall, op. cit., p. 109.\n16 Marshall, op. cit., pp. 55-56.\n17 Association of American Railroads, Railroad Facts, various editions.\n\nHence, according to the company's statements, the project would return approximately 10-15% once it opened for\nbusiness.\nWriting in 1913, just before the canal finally opened, Marshall (and the whole world) knew that the cost estimates\nwere way too low. He also stated that the revenue estimate \"was claimed to be a very conservative assumption,\nwhereas, it was in reality almost beyond the possibility of realization.\"18 Given that the railroad freight charge was as\nmuch as $15 per ton, a price of $3 per ton might well have seemed reasonable at the time. However, by 1913, with\nthe United States running the railroad, the rates were no longer so extravagant and, with larger ships operating, the\nprices of ocean transport had also fallen. Marshall may also have been concerned with the projected volume of traffic.\n(In actual fact, the canal handled 4.9 million long tons of cargo and earned revenues of $4.4 million in its first full\nyear of operation in 1915; by 1923, with cargo of nearly 20 million tons, revenues reached $17.5 million.19\nThe canal was viewed as a tremendous financial opportunity, and the effort was therefore undertaken by the private\nsector. The Panama Canal Company was formed in 1879 with an initial capitalization goal of $80 million and, given\nthe general excitement, double that amount was raised very quickly.\nConstruction began in 1883, and troubles were almost immediately encountered. The amount of excavation required\nwas more than expected, the soil conditions were much softer and more unstable than anticipated, and the 20-foot\ndifference in tides between the Pacific and the Atlantic was recognized as a major problem. Yellow fever and malaria\ntook a fearful toll among the workers and their families, and the project took on the aspect of a military campaign.\nNevertheless, de Lesseps still expected the canal to be completed by 1888. His engineers were more realistic, and\nthey recommended that a lock canal be built to reduce the need for excavation. De Lesseps, however, refused to break\nhis promise for a sea-level canal. Marshall emphasizes that this particular dispute concerned matters of financial rather\nthan engineering feasibility:\nThe point of their decision was whether a sea level canal could be constructed at a cost and in such time as to\nmake its operation a profitable business for the shareholders. Time, of course, is a great factor in the cost of an\noperation involving hundreds of millions. Interest increases at an enormous rate during the later years.\nTherefore, considerations which would preclude the pursuit of a project solely contemplating commercial results\nmight not be of sufficient weight to deter a government from following the same lines. ... Even though the operation\nof the canal should fail to return any interest upon the money invested, the Government might well consider itself\nfully compensated for the outlay by the political advantages secured, the great savings in the movements of\nwarships, and other desiderata. 20\nThe labor force was nearly 10,000 men by 1887; the standard wage was $1.50 per day for about 20 days per month.\nThe payroll for laborers was therefore on the order of $5 million per year. Another 1,500 or so company employees\nadded several more million to the payroll, and costs and transportation of machinery averaged several million per year.\nThe big problem, however, was that the costs were rising and the possibility of ever making a profit was disappearing.\nBy 1889, the company had raised (and spent) $265 million and was looking for more than $100 million more. Interest\ncharges were already $16 million per year, and it was apparent that they would rise to more than $30 million by the\ntime the canal was opened (assuming that it could be completed). Since revenues were projected to be only $18\nmillion, the prospects were nil, and this was evident to everyone with any money to invest. A final effort to raise $160\nmillion in \"lottery bonds\" that would provide 4% interest plus participation in semi-monthly drawings for cash prizes\nwas approved by the government, but only about $60 million was raised. This was the last hope for the French effort,\n18 Marshall, op. cit., p. 98.\n19 Office of Executive Planning, Panama Canal Commission, Historical Reports - Panama Canal Traffic - Oceangoing\nCommerce.\n20 Marshall, op. cit. p. 104.\n\nand the Panama Canal Company went into bankruptcy in 1889.\nAt this point, if the canal project were to be terminated, the company and its shareholders would lose everything. Since\nthe work completed at that time was valued at about $100 million, a major effort was made to reorganize the effort in\norder at least to salvage this value. Colombia, which also stood to gain from the construction of the canal, was also\nvery anxious for work to proceed. The result was that a new company, the New Panama Canal Company, emerged\nfrom the chaos of the old and was given an extension until 1904 to complete the canal.\nAt this time extensive engineering surveys were conducted by a commission established to review the status of the\ncanal. The commission believed that \"a lock canal might be completed in eight years at a further cost of $100 million.\"\nThe New Panama Canal Company therefore studied how such a canal might be built.\nThey also saw another way to escape from their problems: sell their concession, equipment, and the completed\nportions of the canal to the United States, which at that time was pursuing the possibility of digging a canal in\nNicaragua. After several years of negotiations and study, the New Panama Canal Company offered to sell everything\nto the US for $109 million.\nThe Isthmian Canal Commission, in its report to President Roosevelt, set the value of the property at only $40 million\nand concluded that the Nicaragua route would actually be the \"most practical and feasible route\". Since there was\nonly one possible buyer for the property, the New Panama Canal Company, in a panic to salvage something, quickly\nreduced its asking price to $40 million. In turn, the Isthmian Canal Commission revised its opinion concerning the\nroute on the grounds that Panama was preferable at the lower price.\nThis deal cleared the way for the US to take over the construction of the canal, although not before a good deal of\npolitical theatre. Suffice it to say that Colombia attempted to raise the annual fee that it would collect, that the US\nbalked, and that Panamanian citizens, fearful of losing the canal to Nicaragua, declared the independence of Panama.\nMcCullough describes the intrigue in absorbing detail; Joseph Conrad describes the emotions of times in his great\nnovel \"Nostromo,\" which was modeled on these events.\nThe U.S. Effort\nWhen the US took over, they had to deal with several major design issues related to the cost, capacity, and performance\nof the canal:\n-\nSea level canal vs. a lock canal\n-\nThe number and height of the locks\n-\nThe length and the width of the locks\n-\nThe height of the canal above sea level and the size of the lake\nThey also had to deal with the tropical illnesses. Fortunately, mosquitoes had been identified as the transmitters of\nmalaria and yellow fever, so it was possible to formulate and implement a strategy for eliminating mosquitoes as a\nway of controlling disease. That fascinating story is covered by McCullough; suffice it to say that first priority was\ngiven to eradicating the mosquito within the Canal Zone, and the diseases were successfully eliminated.\nA Sea Level Canal vs. a Canal with Locks\nA sea level canal would have the advantage of lower lock cost and easier operations, but it would require more\nexcavation. Since the tides on the Pacific vary by 20 feet from high to low, a tidal lock would be needed on that end\nof the canal even for the sea level route (otherwise tidal currents would be too strong to safely operate large ships\nthrough the canal). A lock canal would reduce the excavation costs and reduce the time required to open the canal to\noperations. Like de Lesseps, most people wanted a sea level canal, if it were reasonably possible to construct one.\n\nPresident Roosevelt stated the case elegantly, in language that could readily be adapted to the evaluation of the\nalternatives being considered for any mega-project:\nI hope that ultimately it will prove feasible to build a sea-level canal. Such a canal would undoubtedly be best in\nthe end, if feasible, and I feel that one of the chief advantages of the Panama Route is that ultimately a sea-level\ncanal will be a possibility. But, while paying heed to the ideal perfectibility of the scheme from an engineer's\nstandpoint, remember the need of having a plan which shall provide for the immediate building of the canal on\nthe safest terms and in the shortest possible time.\nIf to build a sea-level canal will but slightly increase the risk, then of course, it is preferable. But if to adopt a\nplan of a sea-level canal means to incur hazard, and to insure indefinite delay, then it is not preferable. If the\nadvantages and disadvantages are closely balanced I expect you to say so.\n... Two of the prime considerations to be kept steadily in mind are: 1. The utmost practicable speed of\nconstruction. 2. Practical certainty that the plan proposed will be feasible; that it can be carried out with the\nminimum risk.21\nThe Number and Height of Locks\nThe commission recommended a sea-level canal, but the American members filed a minority report recommending a\nlock canal that would reach 85 feet above sea level. Congress accepted the minority report, and that was the basis for\nwhat was built.\nThe number and height of locks represents a balance among lock technology, operating costs, and construction costs.\nThe height of the lock chamber and the mitre gates must be several feet higher than the draft of the largest ships (close\nto 40 feet) plus the height of the lift plus several feet of water under the ship plus a foot or two above water level when\nfull. For an 85 foot lift, this would require two locks with a lift of 42.5 feet each or three with a lift of 27.4 feet each;\neven the smaller lift would be higher than any other locks yet constructed, and the required chambers and gates would\nbe about 80 feet high. A three lock system was selected for each end of the canal.\nFigure 1 A Cross-Section of the Panama Canal22\nThree sets of locks on each side bring ships up to the level of Lake Gatun.\n21 President Theodore Roosevelt's instructions to the International Board of Consulting Engineers that was assembled to consider\nthe principal problems in construction a canal, September, 1905 [Marshall, p. 134].\n22 The Commission for the Study of Alternatives to the Panama Canal, \"Operating Characteristics and Capacity Evaluation Study\",\nMay 1993.\n\nThe Length and Width of the Locks\nThe goal for the canal was to handle the largest ships planned as of that time, which were in fact battleships. The\noriginal dimensions of the lock chambers were to be 900 feet long by 95 feet wide, but the Navy requested an increase\nto 1000 feet long by 110 feet in order to allow for larger ships in the future. There was a debate about whether or not\nto go to the larger size. Colonel Goethals, in charge of the canal construction, advanced the case for staying with a\n100 foot beam:\nThe present lock designs provide intermediate gates dividing the locks into lengths of 600 and 400 feet. About 98\nper cent of all ships, including the largest battleships now building, can be passed through the 600-foot lengths,\nand the total lock length will accommodate the largest commercial vessels now building, which, I believe are\n1,000 feet long and 88 feet beam. It is true that ships may increase in size so as to make the present locks obsolete,\nbut the largest ships now afloat cannot navigate the Suez Canal, nor the proposed sea level canal at Panama. It\nmust also be remembered that the commerce of the work is carried by the medium-sized vessels, the length of only\none of the many ships using the Suez Canal being greater than 600 feet.\"23\nMarshall, who was writing in 1913, was happy to report that Goethals was overruled and the lock dimensions were\nset at 1000 by 110 feet:\nOur new battleships have a beam of 97 feet and upwards, which will leave a clearance in the lock chambers of\nless than 13 feet in all, or about 6 feet on either side. Commercial vessels now built, and others whose keels have\nbeen laid, have a beam of 96 feet, so that it is quite possible that the locks may prove to be too narrow before they\nare found too short.\nWater Requirements\nThe height of the canal above sea-level and the size of the locks represent a balance between the availability of water\nand the size of ships that can be handled. Larger locks require more water, but they can handle larger ships. If the\ncanal is higher, and the chambers are deeper, then more water is also required. A canal requires a source of water,\nsuch as a large lake, that will be sufficient to operate the locks year round. If there is a distinct dry season, then the\nlake ideally would have enough reserve capacity to operate throughout the dry season without affecting operations.\nGiven the size of the lock chambers, a great deal of water is used for each lockage. The basic requirements are that\nthe total water lost through lockages be less than the average annual inflow to the lake and that the surplus water in\nthe system be sufficient at the beginning of the dry season to last until the rains return.\nA height of 85 feet above sea level was selected for Lake Gatun, the 164 square mile lake that was created by flooding\nthe Chagres River (Figure 2). This lake impounded water from a basin of 1,320 square miles that \"enjoyed\" extremely\nheavy tropical rains from early may through the beginning of December. The amount of water was quite considerable.\nIn the 22 years before the opening of the canal, the outflow of the river ranged from a low of 132 billion cubic feet in\n1912 to a high of 360 billion cubic feet in 1910, nearly double the 183 million cubic feet contained by the lake when\nfull. Marshall used the 1912 season to illustrate the adequacy of the lake for supporting the canal operations. If Lake\nGatun enterered the rainy season on December 1 with an elevation of 87 feet and operated with 48 lockages per day,\nthen the lake level would decline to 79.5 feet by May 7th, when the rains returned. With this water level, there would\nbe 39 feet of water in the cut, which would provide sufficient depth for navigation (for the ships of that time). Allowing\nfor evaporation and seepage, there would still be enough water for 41 lockages a day, which was more than could\nactually be done because of the time required per vessel. The width of the cut was originally set at 200 feet, but this\nwould not allow enough room for two large ships to pass. The width was therefore increased to 300 feet. A wider cut\nrequired considerably more excavation, but also increased canal capacity.\n23 Quoted in Marshall, op. cit., p. 186.\n\nFigure 2 Lake Gatun\nA vast supply of water must be available to allow operation of the locks. Lake Gatun was formed by damming the\nChargres River, using the material excavated from the cut to create the dam. Stumps from the forest that was\nsubmerged under the lake are still visible, and divers visit the remains of the old Panama Railroad.\nConstruction Cost and Pricing Policy\nThe Panama Canal was the largest project undertaken by the U.S. up until that time. After the U.S. had been at work\nfor 3 years, it was estimated that the cost would be $375 million, including original payments of $10 million to Panama\nand $40 million to the French company.24 This proved to be accurate, as the actual construction cost was $352 million\nfor the U.S. portion of the work (and a total of $639 million for the French and American efforts). The loss of life\nassociated with the construction was staggering. Disease and accidents claimed 5,609 lives between 1904 and 1914,\nbut this was far better than the French experience, as they lost approximately 20,000 people. If the French companies\nand their prospective stockholders had understood the financial and the human costs, they never would have been able\nto raise the money to begin. If the US Congress had realized the magnitude of the effort in 1904, they might also have\nbalked.\nIt is an irony of history that the first vessel went through the canal on August 3, 1914, the day that World War I\nbegan. Though completed 6 months ahead of schedule, it would be 10 years before traffic would grow to the\nexpected levels of 5,000 ships per year. Toll revenues reached $27 million in 1929 and 1930, but did not reach this\nlevel again until 1953, because of the effects of depression and another world war (Table 1).\nThe U/S. Congress required the Panama Canal to operate on a break-even basis, i.e. it had to cover both operating and\ncapital costs from tolls. This prevented the Commission from incurring debt or from achieving exorbitant profits. It\nalso meant that there was no attempt to recover the capital costs of constructing the canal. If the Canal had been\nfinanced through private sources at 5%, the interest costs during the 10-year construction period would have added\nwell over $100 million to the initial cost, and the carrying charges would have been on the order of $25 million\n24 McCullough, op. cit., p. 610.\n\nannually thereafter. Given the tremendous savings in distance, it is quite possible that tolls could have been raised to\ncover this cost during good times, but it is also quite likely that the Canal would have gone bankrupt during the wars\nor the depression.\nDuring World War I, the Canal played no strategic military role, as the first flotilla of warships to transit the canal was\ncomposed of ships returning home after the war. In World War II, the canal played a major role, as it allowed rapid\ndeployment of ships from the Atlantic to the Pacific theatre of operations.\nIn 1996, the Canal handled 13,536 ocean-going commercial vessels carrying 198 million long tons of cargo and earned\nrevenues of $483 million from tolls. While the average toll per ton remained less than the $3 projected by de Lesseps,\nthe total tonnage and total revenue greatly exceeded his projections of 6 million and $18 million respectively. The\ncumulative toll revenue from the opening of the canal reached $9 billion by 1997.\nTable 1 Oceangoing Traffic Through the Panama Canal, 1915 - 1996\nFiscal\nYear\nTransits/Year\nTransits/Day\nCargo (Long\nTons)\nToll Revenue\n($millions/yr)\nRevenue/Ton\n2.9\n4.9\n$4\n$0.90\n6.6\n9.4\n$9\n$0.91\n12.6\n24.0\n$21\n$0.89\n16.5\n30.0\n$27\n$0.90\n14.2\n25.3\n$23\n$0.92\n14.7\n27.3\n$21\n$0.77\n5.3\n8.6\n$7\n$0.84\n14.9\n28.9\n$24\n$0.85\n21.9\n40.7\n$34\n$0.83\n29.6\n59.3\n$51\n$0.86\n32.4\n78.6\n$65\n$0.83\n37.4\n114.3\n$95\n$0.83\n37.3\n140.1\n$142\n$1.01\n37.0\n167.2\n$292\n$1.75\n31.5\n138.6\n$299\n$2.15\n32.7\n157.1\n$354\n$2.25\n36.9\n190.3\n$460\n$2.42\nSource: data prepared by Office of Executive Planning, Panama Canal Commission, May 8, 1997.\nTransfer of the Canal to Panama\nThe operation of the canal was transferred to Panama on December 31, 1999, culminating a 20-year transition period\nin which responsibility was shifted from the US to Panama. In anticipation of the transfer, the Panama Canal\nCommission and the US Army Corps of Engineers conducted a thorough inspection of the canal and the locks. In\ngeneral, the locks and the canal were believed to be in excellent condition, and programs were in place for maintenance\nand rehabilitation of the major components of the canal.\nA greater concern was the capacity of the canal, both in terms of the size of ships that can fit through the locks and\nthe number of ships that can be handled on a sustainable basis. In 1996, the canal handled a record-breaking 37.5\nocean-going ships per day, which caused the Canal Waters Time (the time from arrival at one end of the canal until\ndeparture from the other end) to rise from the target level of 24 hours to more than 30 hours. This increase in delay\nsignaled potentially serious capacity problems for the canal.\n\nIssues for the 21st Century\nPost-Panamax Ships\nAircraft carriers and oil tankers were the first ships that exceeded the dimensions of the locks. In the 1980s, a new\nclass of containerships (Post-Panamax) was designed for use in trans-Pacific operations; to reduce the cost per\ncontainer, these ships were built wider than the 110 feet that could go through the canal. Even larger ships were being\nplanned for the future. Since container shipping was one of the fastest growing areas of commerce, the existence of a\nlarge number of Post-Panamax ships was a strategic concern for the canal.\nIncreasing the Operating Capacity of the Canal\nThe capacity of the locks is limited by the average time required to move a large ship through one chamber, which is\nabout an hour, suggesting a maximum service rate of 2 vessels per hour (since there are two parallel channels in each\nset of locks). Additional time is also required to position ships as they arrive at the locks and the locks must\nperiodically be closed for routine inspections and maintenance, so the sustainable capacity drops to 37-38 vessels per\nday.\nFigure 3 Pedro Miguel Lock\nNote that the locomotives that are attached by cables to the container ships. The ship moves through the lock under\nits own power, while the ship's pilot directs the locomotive engineers to tighten or loosen the cables in order to\nkeep the ship properly aligned. Also note how little room there is to spare between the ships and the side of the\nlocks.\n\nSome efficiency can be gained in lockages by increasing the number and reliability of the specialized railroad\nlocomotives that are used to guide ships through the locks. Several minutes can be lost in repositioning locomotives\nwhen several large ships are going through simultaneously. The Panama Canal Commission therefore authorized $90\nmillion to increase the fleet from 82 to 110 locomotives.25\nWidening the Gaillard Cut\nThe Gaillard Cut was originally a minimum of 91.5m wide for its entire 12 km length. Widening to 152m, begun in\nthe 1930s and completed by the early 1970s, allowed unrestricted two-way traffic for almost all ships operating at that\ntime. However, by the 1980s, a substantial and growing number of the vessels using the canal were Panamax ships\nthat were too large and unwieldy and too valuable to risk passing in the Gaillard Cut or operating in the Cut after dark\n(Table 2). It was necessary for fleets of these large ships to operate single file through this nine-mile stretch during\nthe daylight. This complicated scheduling and restricted capacity of the canal.\nTable 2 Panama Canal Traffic (Long Tons), by Commodity Group, 1994-1996\nCommodity Group\nGrains\n42.34\n44.07\n34.07\nPetroleum and petroleum products\n32.77\n27.48\n26.96\nContainerized cargo\n25.62\n24.91\n22.44\nNitrates, phosphates and potash\n15.94\n15.91\n15.44\nCoal and coke (excluding petroleum coke)\n11.38\n11.32\n9.34\nOres and metals\n11.52\n10.76\n10.10\nLumber and products, including pulp wood\n11.03\n10.71\n9.47\nChemicals and petroleum chemicals\n11.37\n10.11\n9.71\nManufactures of iron and steel\n8.35\n9.17\n7.85\nCanned and refrigerated foods\n6.95\n6.86\n7.00\nMinerals, miscellaneous\n6.87\n5.43\n5.79\nOther agricultural commodities\n5.16\n4.92\n4.54\nMachinery and equipment\n1.93\n2.14\n2.05\nAll other\n6.62\n6.52\n6.61\nTotal\n198.07\n190.3\n170.54\nSource: Office of Executive Planning, Panama Canal Commission, Report TRA 1-3, Nov. 18, 1996\nA widening program was begun during the mid-1990s and was initially scheduled to be completed by 2005. At a cost\nof $200 million, this program increased the Cut to 192m in straight sections and up to 222m in curves in order to allow\nbi-directional operation of Panamax vessels, which would increase the capacity to approximately 42 ships per day.\nThe program was spread out over so many years in order to allow the work to be done largely with the existing\nworkforce and equipment. When the number of Panamax vessels grew rapidly during the mid-1990s, the capacity\nproblem became more critical, and the program was accelerated.26\nSystem Control\nA $20 million effort to develop a computerized scheduling system enabled higher utilization of the cut by adjusting\nthe sequence of large ships through the system. These management efficiencies increased overall capacity by 1 ship\nper day.\n25 Spillway Newsletter, Canal accelerates modernization plan, improvement work, Panama Canal Commission, September 20,\n1996.\n26 Panama Canal Commission, Gaillard Cut Widening Program, 1996.\n\nFigure 4 Widening the Gaillard Cut, 1996\nThis process required dredging to widen the canal, cutting back the hillsides along the cut, and providing sluices\nto channel water from heavy rains into the canal. The process could be accelerated by devoting more resources to\nthe task.\nExpanding the Canal\nBy the mid-1990s, it was evident that the canal would have to be expanded in order to handle the demand projected\nfor the first half of the next century. Even the pessimistic scenarios for growth forecast traffic growing to more than\n50 vessels per day by 2050, which is at least 10 to 20% above what the above improvements could allow on a\nsustainable basis.\nSeveral major options were considered, including adding a third set of locks, replacing the existing locks with larger\nlocks, and construction of a new sea-level canal (Table 3).\nA sea-level canal was estimated to cost on the order of\n$12 billion to construct, and it would require large ships to move single file through the canal. A sea-level canal would\nrequire carving out an entirely new route. Moreover, parts of the route would be only one lane wide, so that the largest\nships would be unable to pass. Hence, the capacity of the new canal would be only half the capacity of the existing\ncanal, and building such a canal would only provide a 50% increase in overall capacity. Adding a new set of locks,\neven a much larger set of locks, would be less costly and would provide a greater boost in capacity. With the ability\nto handle larger ships, canal capacity would be increased by 70% at a cost estimated at about $2 billion by the US\nArmy Corps of Engineers in 1995. The third set of locks was therefore selected as the most cost effective way to\nincrease capacity, and work began on this project after the Canal was transferred to Panama. The third set of locks\nwas finally completed and opened to traffic in 2016.\n\nTable 3 Conceptual Alternatives to the Existing Canal27\nExisting\nHigh-Rise\nLow-Rise\nCanal\nLocks (a)\nLocks (b)\nSea-Level (c)\nVessel Size (dead wt. tons)\n65 million\n250 million\n250 million\n300 million\nRise (feet above sea level)\nNumber of lifts\nNumber of lanes\nHalf with 1;\nhalf with 2\na)\nThis option would utilize taller gates so that only two lifts would be required; a somewhat deeper lake would\nnecessitate a higher rise. (One variation of this option would be to keep the existing locks and add a third set that\nwould be able to handle larger ships, thereby increasing capacity 70%.)\nb)\nThis option would require a new location for the locks, with only a single lift required.\nc)\nThis option would require an entirely new sea-level canal) that would still require locks because the great difference\nin tides would result in unacceptably rapid currents through the canal.\n27 The Commission for the Study of Alternatives to the Panama Canal, \"Operating Characteristics and Capacity Evaluation Study\",\nMay 1993.\n\nCase Study\nPearl River Delta: \"More than a Bridge\"\nThe greatest mistakes in project evaluation are likely to be made very early by defining projects too\nnarrowly or incorrectly. Likewise, the greatest contributions to the success of a project may come\nfrom people who view possibilities from a broad perspective. The context within which such a\nproject is initially viewed may dramatically limit or expand the long-term costs and benefits to an\nentire region of a country.\nThis case study shows how an experienced interdisciplinary team framed the issues and\nopportunities associated with a major infrastructure project within one of the world's largest,\nmulti-centric regions, namely the Pearl River Delta in China. The team participated in the earliest\nstages of public debates concerning the possibility of bridging the Pearl River estuary. The basic\nidea had been around for at least two decades, but there was as yet no commitment to any particular\nplan. It was therefore possible to introduce new ideas, to debate the justification of the project, to\nexplore related issues, and to prepare a broader context for evaluating the project. What seemed\nto be a question of how to pay for a bridge turned out to be a question of how the construction of\none or more bridges could influence traffic management, economic development, open space, water\nquality, and other factors within the populous Pearl River Delta region of China.\nBackground\nThe Pearl River Delta is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. Guangzhou, at the head of the Delta,\nis a city of 15 million people; Hong Kong, on the eastern edge of the Delta, is one of the most prosperous cities and\nlargest ports in the world; the region includes Macau on the west side of the delta and a half dozen other major cities\nwith more than a million people each. Overall, more than 40 million people live in this region. The institutional\nstructure of the region is complex, as Macau and Hong Kong are Special Administrative Regions (SARs) and Zhuhai\nand Shenzhen are Special Economic Regions (SERs). While it is all part of China, the region has complex boundaries\nand customs regulations. At the time of the study, economic growth in the region was expected to continue its torrid\npace as the various pieces of the region become more fully integrated.1\nBy 2002, proposals had originated both from Hong Kong and China to build a bridge and/or a tunnel across the Pearl\nRiver in order to integrate Hong Kong with the West Delta. The proposals sparked debates about the need and\njustification for such a project, the nature and location of the crossing, the financing of the project, and the potential\nsocial and environmental impacts. The Hong Kong 2022 Foundation asked an interdisciplinary team from M.I.T. to\nprovide guidance in identifying and assessing the major issues and constraints that should be considered in assessing\nany proposal for creating a link between Hong Kong and the west side of the delta. The foundation was not at that\ntime interested in specific designs.\nThe team was headed by Professors Tunney Lee and Ralph Gakenheimer of M.I.T.'s Department of Urban Studies\nand Planning and Nien Dak Sze, chairman of AER, Inc, a consulting firm with experience related to major projects in\nHong Kong. Fred Salvucci, senior lecturer in the Department of Civil Engineering was a key member of team; his\nunique experience included two terms as Secretary of the Executive Office of Transportation and Construction in\nMassachusetts at a time when the state initiated several major transit and highway projects. Salvucci and Lee both\nhad a long history in transportation planning in Boston, going back to the early 1970s when Massachusetts decided to\nscrap the plans for ever more highways and to develop a more balanced transportation system.2\n1 Enright, M, K.M. Chang, E. Scott, and W.H. Zhu, \"Hong Kong & the Pearl River Delta: The Economic Interaction\", The 2022\nFoundation, Hong Kong, 2003\n2 Other members of the team included Ken Kruckemeyer (lecturer at MIT and former engineer with EOTC; expert in bridge design\nand neighborhood impacts of transportation projects) and Gerry Flood (expert in mapping and computer graphics). The team was\n\nThe study revolved around a series of informal weekly or bi-weekly meetings that allowed a great deal of open-ended\ndiscussion about options, issues, strategies for projects, and schemes for presenting our ideas. Articles about the\nproject, which appeared regularly in the Chinese press, were circulated to the team.\nIt quickly became evident - based upon comparisons with similar projects successfully completed around the world\nthat it would be possible to build a bridge across the Pearl River. Depending upon the location of the project, a tunnel\nwould be desirable in order to avoid any interference with shipping to and from the port of Hong Kong. It was also\nevident that the economic benefit would like be very high, so that it would be possible to justify the project either from\nthe perspective of the public sector (effects on gross domestic product and regional integration) or the private sector\n(profitability based upon toll-based financing). A major concern was that government agencies would move too\nquickly to begin construction of a project without clearly understanding the range of issues and impacts that were\nrelevant. It would be easy to build and finance a bridge that would not be close to the best size, in the best location,\nwith the best design, with the best integration with other infrastructure projects, or with the best environmental and\nsocial impacts.\nThe team members did not have the data, the analytical resources, or the inclination to conduct detailed traffic analyses\nor to pursue any technical or economic analysis. Instead, they used international examples, their combined experience\nwith major projects, their knowledge of transportation systems, and straightforward analysis to highlight what they\nfelt were key issues.\n-\nThe bridge was feasible, as bridges and tunnels of similar length had been constructed elsewhere in the world\n(Table 1).\n-\nSince the bridge/tunnel would provide a much shorter route between two very densely populated areas, the\nPearl River Delta offered an excellent opportunity for constructing a bridge.\n-\nThe debate should consider the location of the bridge, the possibility of have a Y-shaped bridge (i.e. one that\nlinks two cities on one side with one on the other side), a double-Y, or two separate bridges.\n-\nThe bridge should be considered as a key link in a multi-centric region, with implications for traffic\nmanagement, investment and economic growth throughout the region.\n-\n\"More than a bridge:\" the project should be reviewed in light of opportunities for such things as renewable\nenergy (wind power or solar farms located on or near the bridge), development of existing islands, the\ncreation and development of new islands, and the location of piers and new islands so as to promote river\nflow and prevent silting.\nTable 1 Examples of Long Bridges and Tunnels\nBridge or Tunnel\nLength\nCost\nToll\nChunnel (rail tunnel connecting Great Britain and\nFrance)\n50 km\n$21 billion\n$75\nLake Pontchartrain Causeway (causeway\nconnecting New Orleans to points north of the city)\n$0.06 billion\n$1.50\nChesapeake Bay Bridge/Tunnel (connecting\nNorfolk VA with the Eastern Shore of VA)\n$0.4 billion\n$10\nOresund (Denmark - Sweden)_\n$2.4 billion\n$32\nTokyo Bay Aqualine (connecting Tokyo with the\nrelatively undeveloped eastern side of Tokyo Bay)\n$11.7 billion\n$20\nsupported by graduate students Yanni Tsippis, Dalong Shi and Mark Schoffield in MIT's Transportation program As a member of\nthe team, my role was to provide support in two areas, project evaluation and freight transportation. As a participant, I was able to\nobserve, first-hand, how discussions and ideas came up, mutated, and eventually became part of a consensus about what could or\nshould be done and what should not be done.\n\nThe research produced a highly polished report that was laden with pictures and figures with great visual appeal.3 The\nreport, which included poster-sized pullouts, was aimed at conveying information and insights very quickly. The\nreport was presented at a workshop held at Hong Kong University on March 25-26, 2003. The workshop was\norganized by the sponsor, the 2022 Foundation, as a means of promoting discussion among government officials,\nrepresentatives of non-government organizations (NGOs), and private sector business leaders from both China and\nHong Kong. The study helped promote awareness of the wide range of benefits and options and of the importance of\nintegrating the bridge project with other regional infrastructure planning efforts related to economic development,\ntransportation systems, and the environment.\nHow the Team Did Its Work\nTime is necessary for gestation of ideas. As the team members met regularly over a period of eight months, they\nevolved an ever more complex view of the project, along with an increasingly coherent story to tell about the project.\nThe process involved brainstorming, contemplation, debates, re-consideration of issues, introduction of new issues\nand perspectives, preliminary analysis, and more debates. The idea of using international comparisons came up in the\nteam's first meeting, in May 2002. The major options for the alignment were identified by August, and the possibility\nof building two bridges was broached in September. The team did not seriously consider the importance of viewing\nthe bridge as a key link in a multi-centric region until early in 2003. The role of tolls was discussed in July 2002, then\nvisited again in February as part of a broader discussion of traffic management within the region. The team referred\nto environmental concerns at the outset, but eventually had more specific ideas about leaving more open space on the\neast side, about bypassing the coast when developing the west side, and integrating the bridge with the efforts to clean\nup the estuary. The team also discussed the aesthetics of the bridge, including an idea that the bridge could be designed\nso as to resemble a dragon when viewed from the air - with the ability to have fireworks propelled from the Dragon's\nmouth. The result was not something that any team member could have created individually, nor was it something\nthat the entire group could have created in a short time.\nWhile the team was developing its view of the project, the South China Morning Post published many articles that\nprovided information and opinions concerning the economic potential for the bridge, financing ideas, and\nenvironmental considerations, especially issues unique to the region. Major potential benefits of the project included\nintegration of Hong Kong within the Pearl River Delta region and strengthening the ability of that region to compete\nwith other regions in China, notably Shanghai. Better connectivity would promote regional economic growth and\nhelp maintain the role of Hong Kong and the region as an international logistics center.\nThe results of the interdisciplinary study did indeed broaden the debate. One impetus for the study was a specific\nproposal by a Hong Kong businessman, Sir Gordon Wu, who had offered to build a bridge at no cost to the government.\nHis company would build the bridge and finance the costs by pledging toll revenues to cover debt servicing. He\nindicated that the public sector would only have to cover the cost of a 9-km connecting road. The early articles referred\nto \"the bridge\" and \"the route\" and whether or not a public subsidy would be needed. The team's report, as described\nabove and as illustrated in Figure 1, widened the debate and specifically emphasized the need to consider other uses\nfor tolls (traffic management and financing for other parts of the system, not just financing for the bridge), the need to\nmaximize the public benefits of the bridge, and the potential for tying the bridge project into comprehensive plans for\nimproving the region's infrastructure and environment.\n3 Martland, Gakenheimer, Kruckemeyer, Lee, Murga, Salvucci, Shi, Sze, Gongal, Flood, Imai, and Won, \"Linking the Delta:\nBridging the Pearl River Delta\", The 2022 Foundation, Hong Kong,2003 (www.2022foundation.com)\n\nLessons Learned From the Pearl River Delta Study\n1. An interdisciplinary team will need to go far and fast in preliminary thinking about a project like this. It will\nnot be possible to take the time to study all of the issues that arise, nor will it be necessary to go into\ntremendous detail at this early stage of project evaluation. Digressions on methodological issues or technical\nissues may divert time and resources from understanding strategic issues that could affect the public debate.\n2. The private sector may realize the gross feasibility of project - so someone may push for an immediate start,\nand the public response may be \"why not let them begin?\" It is necessary to emphasize that the public should\nbe looking for the best project, not simply a good project or a profitable project. The benefits of a project\nmay be great enough to \"really do it right\".\n3. Spirited discussion may quickly give a greater appreciation of options - location, size, design, related\ninfrastructure, timing, etc.\n4. A project may initially be regarded as a local project with very specific costs and benefits. As discussion\nprogresses, a study team will gain a greater appreciation of a wider range of costs and benefits affecting\nregional and national as well as local concerns.\nFigure 1 Schematic Representation of the Issues Related to Bridging the Pearl River Delta\nSource: Linking the Delta: Bridging the Pearl River Delta, 2022 Foundation, Hong Kong, 2003\n\nCase Study\nAlternatives for Exporting Soybeans from Bolivia\nIf the right questions are asked, or if you talk to the right people, you might realize that the rationale\nfor a proposed project has overlooked some critical factors. In this case study, the question was\ninitially framed as a matter of filling in a gap in the Bolivian rail system that would make that rail\nsystem more competitive with Brazil's. It soon became apparent that the real completion was neither\nthe existing Brazilian rail system nor the proposed extension of that system. Instead, the real\ncompetition came from a completely different mode of transportation.\nThe eastern region of Bolivia, like the adjacent portions of Brazil, includes some of the most productive agricultural\nlands in the world. Soybeans are one of the most profitable crops in this region, as there is worldwide demand for soy\nproducts and the South American harvest is six months offset from the more abundant harvest in the northern\nhemisphere. Because of a 1000-mile gap in the Bolivian rail system, soybeans have to be exported via Brazil. If this\ngap were filled by a new railroad, then soybeans could be hauled over the Andes to a Pacific port for export to Asia,\nsaving thousands of miles for the ocean trip, not to mention avoiding the delay and cost of going through the Panama\nCanal. The idea of constructing a rail line to unite the agricultural east with the central and western portions of the\ncountry has been discussed for more than 75 years. Known as the \"Interconnection\", this line has been the dream of\nmany an engineer and many a railroad president.\nA transportation consulting firm conducted a preliminary study comparing the cost of moving soybeans by rail from\neastern Bolivia to Brazilian ports on the Atlantic to the cost of moving via Bolivia to Chilean ports on the Pacific. The\nstudy showed that the Bolivian route would be competitive, so the government continued to explore the issue. Another\nconsulting team was asked to visit exporters and transportation officials in both the Santa Cruz region of Bolivia and\nin the neighboring states of Brazil. The team updated the analysis of the prior study and confirmed that the Bolivian\nrail route was indeed competitive with the existing rail route to the Brazilian ports on the Atlantic. However, Brazilian\nrail officials described their plans for building a new rail line that would connect to a port on the Amazon, which\nwould shorten the rail trip by more than a thousand miles with little change in the ocean shipping cost; they expected\nthat this route would be used to export soybeans from much of the region. With this new route, it was no longer as\nclear that the Bolivian Interconnection would be able to attract a substantial amount of soybean traffic.\nInterviews with exporters were even more discouraging, for they pointed out that most of the soybeans moved south\non the Parana River to Argentina, where they were loaded onto ships for export around the world. The barge\nmovements along the river were much cheaper than the rail movements, and the main costs of ocean shipping related\nto loading and unloading. The savings from having a shorter ocean trip were nowhere near enough to cover the\nincreases in cost that would result from using rail to reach a Pacific port.\nFailing to include barge transportation was a major defect in the original study. Had government officials not been so\nconcerned with competing with Brazil's rail system, they might have recognized the need to investigate the inland\nwaterway option. Had the consultants viewed their task as studying choices faced by exporters rather than as a study\nof relative costs of using different rail routes, they would quickly have realized that the barge service was superior\n(i.e. much cheaper) than any of the existing rail options.\nIn this case, the \"do-nothing\" option prevailed, and Bolivia did not attempt to build a railroad up the eastern slope of\nthe Andes.\n\nCase Study\nScenario Planning at Southern California Edison\nBy focusing on plausible uncertainties and postulating alternative futures, scenario planning\nemphasizes the unpredictability of future events and their impact on operations, sales, prices,\ndemand, and so forth. The process of constructing and analyzing the impact of scenarios forces\nthe planners to delve into the dynamics, the cause-and-effect relationships that determine the future.\nThe process identifies major weaknesses as well as major opportunities that exist under different\nscenarios. Consequently, management can prepare contingency plans to deal with threats and take\nadvantage of opportunities.1\nSouthern California Edison (SCE) used scenario planning to guide its investment strategy when faced with the need\nto expand its production capabilities. They used a three-stage process: scenario development, implications of\nscenarios, and development of strategies. As the first step in scenario development, they identified eight key factors\nthat would influence their need for generating power:\n-\nPrice of fuel and purchased power\n-\nBase case rates based upon current operating and maintenance costs\n-\nDemand for electricity, which was assumed to be proportional to economic growth\n-\nChanges in environmental regulations\n-\nOpen access to SCE's transmission\n-\nCustomers generating their own power\n-\nTechnical innovation (for the company and for consumer appliances)\n-\nPopulation growth\n-\nGeneration shutdown\nThey then created an initial set of 45 scenarios based upon these eight drivers, which they clustered into groups from\nwhich they eventually selected twelve scenarios for analysis. The twelve scenarios were each defined by changes in\nproduction requirements related to the eight drivers. The scenarios were designed to span a range of production\nranging from 5,000 megawatts below their base case forecast to 5,000 megawatts above. Table 1 shows how four of\nthe strategies were defined in terms of increases or decreases in production that were related to the eight drivers.\nTaken together, these twelve scenarios indicated the extent to which SCE should plan for dealing with the need to\nincrease or decrease production. SCE then identified ways that they could increase or reduce production capacity for\neach scenario, by using strategies such as the following:\n-\nCapacity could be increased by 900 MW by taking power plants out of standby reserve or reduced by as\nmuch as 1500 MW by putting additional power plants into standby reserve.\n-\nEnergy purchased from other companies could be increased by as much as 2,000 MW.\n-\nEnergy management, such as peak load pricing, could be used to add 500 MW or to reduce 1050 MW of\nproduction.\nThis analysis revealed problems that SCE would have to deal with under some of the extremely low or extremely high\ndemand scenarios. For example, to deal with increased power needs, SCE identified projects that could be\nimplemented quickly so as to increase capacity, and they determined that they would need to enhance their ability for\nenergy management.\n1 Fred Mobasheri, Lowell H.

If the bridge were\nbuilt as a public project, then there would be several options for financing. The bridge could be viewed as part of the\nhighway system, and whatever funds are used to construct highways could be used to pay for the construction of the\nbridge. For example, the federal or state government may have a highway trust fund (HTF)1 that uses income from\nfuel taxes and registration fees to pay for authorized additions to the highway network (Figure 1). If the bridge is\napproved as a project that can be supported by the HTF, the design and construction of the bridge can begin. This\nwas the basic approach used in the United States to create the Interstate Highway System and many state highways.\nState and city governments may also use tax revenues to support highway projects, and they can sell bonds to raise\nsome of the funds required for construction (Figure 2).\nFigure 1 Structure of a Highway Trust Fund\nMoney collected from various fees and taxes is used to fund authorized projects,\nsometimes including transit or intermodal projects as well as highway projects.\nHighway\nTrust Fund\n(HTF)\nFuel Taxes\nTaxes on Tires\nVehicle\nRegistration Fees\nFunding for Authorized Projects:\n-\nHighway Projects\n-\nIntermodal Projects\n-\nTransit Projects\nA city or state will commonly finance a bridge project using funds from the HTF or by selling bonds to cover the\nconstruction costs and using money from the state's Department of Transportation (DOT) budget to cover annual\noperating costs. If bonds are sold to help finance the bridge, and if there are no tolls on the bridge, then the bonds are\n1 The federal HTF was created in 1956 as a mechanism for financing the constructing the Interstate Highway System. Fees and\ntaxes on fuel and heavy trucks provided sufficient revenue to cover the federal government's 90% of the construction costs.\nSubsequent legislation allowed small amounts of the fund to be diverted to transit and intermodal projects. The federal fund can\nonly be used for construction, not for operations or maintenance, which remain state responsibilities. States have similar funds,\nwith fuel taxes again providing the major source of revenue. For the complete history of the HTF and the Interstate Highway\nSystem, see Tom Lewis, Divided Highways, Penguin Books, NY, 1997.\n\nbacked by credit of the state or local government. If there are tolls, then the bonds would be backed by the expected\ntoll payments. Once the bridge is constructed, it clearly belongs to a particular government agency and that agency\nor another agency is responsible for maintaining and if necessary rehabilitating the bridge. If bonds were sold to pay\nfor the bridge, then those bonds may affect the credit rating of the city or state. If the project were funded out of tax\nrevenues, then it may have been necessary to defer work on schools, water resource projects, or other government\nprojects or activities. Also, some cities or states have limits on the total debt that they can incur. Borrowing to pay\nfor the bridge therefore may limit their ability to borrow for some other purpose. Hence, there may be strong incentives\nto use tolls to finance the bridge.\nFigure 2 Cash flows for a typical bridge project.\nSome additional analysis is needed to determine whether toll financing, a state highway project or a public private\npartnership (PPP) is the best option for this bridge. The first question is whether or not the bridge is on a route that\nwould qualify for funding as part of the state highway system. If not, the next question is whether or not high enough\ntolls can be charged to cover the costs of interest and operations. If so, then the question is whether the city should\nbuild the bridge and collect the tolls or whether the city should create a public private partnership to build and operate\nthe bridge. The city could authorize the bridge and provide the connections to local roads, while a private company\ncould raise funds to pay for the construction costs. The private company would then charge tolls so as to earn a return\non its investment. This approach works only if the expected value of the tolls is sufficient to provide an adequate\nreturn on capital, e.g. more than enough to cover the interest due on bonds and annual operating expense. The limit\non the toll would be the value that users would place upon using the bridge. The toll could be quite high for a bridge\nthat would provide a much shorter or less congested route, but if other bridges are located nearby, then the presence\nor absence of tolls on those bridges would affect what can be charged on the new bridge. With this approach to\nbuilding the bridge, the costs would be borne by the private company, not by any public agency, so the construction\nof the bridge would not affect any public budgets or capital plans. On the other hand, if the bridge is built privately,\nthen the design and capacity of the bridge, as well as the level of tolls charged would be determined by the private\ncompany, possibly with an eye toward maximizing profits rather than maximizing public benefits. There could be\nintense public opposition to allowing a private company to charge what might be viewed as exorbitant tolls in order\nmake excessive profits on an ugly bridge with limited capacity. Thus, there would likely be political pressure to retain\nsome aspect of public control over the project.\n\nFigure 3 Toll Booth on the West Virginia Turnpike\nMost of the turnpikes in the U.S. were constructed by state\ngovernments prior to the start of the Interstate Highway\nProgram. Tolls cover the interest and redemption costs related\nto the bonds sold to finance the roads and also cover the costs\nof maintenance and operations. Tolls can also be used to\nmanage congestion, by charging higher rates at peak hours or\nby charging higher rates for an express lane. Some states have\nconsidered privatizing their toll roads as a means of capturing\nthe value of their investments, either to finance future transport\nsystem improvements or to reduce their states' indebtedness.\nVarious options could be used in a PPP. One common approach is for the public agency to seek bids in which the key\nvariables would include a) the design of the bridge, b) the tolls to be charged and c) the length of time over which the\nprivate company would operate the bridge. The bridge would be owned (or eventually be owned) by the public\nagency, but it would be operated for an extensive period before it was turned over to the public agency. The public\nrole could be to retain control over the size, design, location, and purpose of the bridge; to ensure that the tolls are\nreasonable; to provide some financial security for the private company by providing some sort of minimum annual\npayment if traffic volumes do not rise as expected; or to provide assurance that a competitive project would not be\nbuilt within some specified period of time.\nLet's examine the various financing options using a hypothetical bridge project. Suppose that a new bridge has been\nproposed that would reduce the travel time and cost between two rapidly growing regions in the rural portion of a\nstate. The bridge, which is strongly supported by local officials, would create a route that would save each user an\naverage of 10 miles and 15 minutes. The bridge is expected to cost between $40 and $60 million to construct, and\nannual maintenance and operating costs are expected to be $4 to $5 million. There are currently 10,000 vehicles per\nday that use the route, and a preliminary study indicates that nearly all of this traffic would use the new bridge. About\n80% of the vehicles on this route are automobiles, while nearly all of the rest are trucks. We will consider three\noptions, namely structuring the project as a routine state highway project, as a private toll bridge, or as a public/private\ninitiative.\nCan the Bridge be Justified as a State Project?\nLocal officials would like naturally prefer the option in which the state pays for the bridge and does not charge a toll,\nas this would result in the maximum benefits for local citizens and companies. They would also like the bridge to be\nconstructed as soon as possible, preferably within the next two to five years. The big question is whether or not this\nbridge project can be justified as part of the state's transportation investment plan.\nTo answer this question, it is necessary to consider the state's transportation budget and the nature of other projects\ncompeting for state funds. The state has a prioritized list of transportation projects based upon a formula that\nrecognizes the benefits of reducing congestion, improving safety, reducing travel times, and promoting economic\ndevelopment. For this example, assume that it is apparent that the proposed bridge would not have a very high priority.\nThere are many projects involving bridges and road rehabilitation involving much more heavily traveled routes in\nmore densely populated areas of the state, while the existing route, though long, has very few accidents and essentially\nno congestion. In short, this is a low priority bridge, and there is no immediate way to dramatize the need for it.\nMoreover, the state's highway trust fund is substantially underfunded, primarily because fuel taxes have not been\nincreased for nearly 20 years. The trust fund can barely provide enough funds for high priority projects, and medium\n\npriority projects have been set back ten or more years in the state's investment plan.\nIn short, local officials cannot\nexpect to have the state pay for the proposed new bridge.\nCould a Private Bridge Project be Financed with Tolls?\nWould it be possible for a private company to build the bridge? If so, would that be a good idea for the region? The\neconomic value of the bridge is the time and cost saved by those who use the bridge to shorten their travel distances\nplus additional benefits related to economic development that is likely to result from the increase in mobility provided\nby the new bridge.\nIn this example, assume that the major economic benefit comes from a reduction in travel expense for those that use\nthe new bridge. The state DOT estimates the marginal cost per mile for driving an automobile to be $0.20, taking into\nconsideration the cost of fuel and the wear and tear on the vehicle. The marginal cost per mile for driving a truck is\non the order of $0.50. The average value of the time saved is on the order of $10/hour for automobile passengers and\n$20/hour for trucks.\nWould a private company be able to finance the bridge by selling bonds backed by toll revenues? The first step is to\nestimate the annual revenue that must be raised by the tolls. If the bridge is financed by selling corporate bonds, the\ninterest rate would have to be about 8%. The interest costs would therefore be 8% of the construction cost, or $3 to\n$5 million.2 The total annual cost, including maintenance and operations as well as interest, would therefore be $8 to\n$10 million.\nThe next step is to estimate the potential annual revenue. The toll can be no higher than the economic benefit of using\nthe bridge. Using the DOT cost numbers, the average benefits per user can be estimated:\nAuto benefits = 10 miles ($0.20/mile) + 0.25 hours ($10/hour) = $4.50\nTruck benefits = 10 miles ($0.50/mile) + 0.25 hours ($20/hour) = $10\nWeighted average benefits per vehicle = 0.8 ($4.50) + 0.2 ($10) = $5.60\nIf 10,000 vehicles used the bridge per day, the annual economic benefits would be as follows:\nAnnual benefits = $5.60/veh. (10,000 veh./day) (365 days/yr) = $20 million per year.\nIn other words, the annual economic benefits appear to be at least double the annual costs for interest and operations,\neven if the bridge costs are at the high end of what is anticipated. A toll of $3 for automobiles and $6 for trucks would\nbe sufficient to cover annual costs. Moreover, since the regions served by the bridge are rapidly growing, traffic\nvolumes and toll revenues would be expected to rise. Thus, it does appear to be feasible for a private company to\nbuild the bridge using money raised by selling bonds and paying the interest on the bonds with tolls that users would\nbe willing to pay.\nShould the Bridge Be Built as a Public Private Partnership?\nThe public might well object to the prospect of a private company building the cheapest possible bridge and charging\nthe highest possible tolls. The analysis has shown that a toll of $3 per car and $6 per truck would be more than\nsufficient to cover the 8% interest rate that the private company would pay on its bonds. However, the same analysis\nshowed that the toll could be nearly 50% higher and still attract most of the traffic. If the bridge is as critical as the\nlocal officials believe, and if the region continues to grow as expected, then traffic volume - and toll revenues - would\n2 If the construction cost is at the low end of the estimates, then the annual interest will be 8% of $40 million; at the high end of\nthe estimates, the interest would b 8% of 60 million. These are all estimates, so all that can be said is that the interest payments are\nlikely to be $3 to $5 million per year.\n\nbe expected to increase substantially over the life of the bridge. Might it be better to structure the project as a\npublic/private partnership?\nThe logic for public involvement is that interest costs could be lowered and that tolls could be controlled. A regional\nauthority could be created that would approve the design for the bridge and own the bridge, and this authority could\nseek a partner or partners to construct and operate the bridge. With public backing, it would be possible to get lower\ninterest rates by selling tax-free municipal bonds to fund the project. Even if the regional authority were unwilling or\nunable to sell bonds to finance the project, they could still seek bids for constructing and operating the bridge. They\ncould also stipulate that the bridge (and the toll revenues) would revert to the regional authority after a period of twenty\nor more years.\nIn fact, major bridges are commonly funded by tolls. So long as there is a substantial amount of potential traffic that\nwill enjoy considerable time savings, tolls can be used to pay the interest on the bonds issued to finance the project.\nFigure 1 shows the entrance to the tunnel portion of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge/Tunnel. This project drastically\nimproved connectivity within the State of Virginia and also provided a much shorter route for travel up and down the\nEast Coast.\nFigure 1 The Chesapeake Bay Bridge/Tunnel\nThis 20-mile bridge/tunnel was built between 1960\nand 1964 in order to link the Norfolk region with the\nEastern Shore of Virginia. The tunnel portions of the\nproject ensure that Chesapeake Bay will always\nremain open to shipping and to the U.S. Navy; islands\ncreated for the entrances to the tunnels are in\nthemselves a tourist attraction.\nThe bridge/tunnel not only provides a link\nbetween two areas of the state, it provides a much\nshorter and less congested through route than\nInterstate 95 for much travel along the East Coast.\nBecause the bridge saves so much time compared to a\nferry, and because the route is much shorter and less\ncongested the I95 route, travelers are willing to pay\nthe substantial tolls of up to $15 for automobiles and\n$26 for trucks. A second two-lane bridge was added\nin 1999 in order to provide extra capacity and avoid\ncongestion. Both bridges were financed by tolls, and\nno local, state, or federal tax dollars were used.\n\nCase Study\nPublic Incentives for Low-Income Housing\nPublic and private interests may come together to promote multiple objectives by allowing\ndenser development in a suburban setting. Re-zoning land for denser development can offer\ngreat opportunities for developers; requiring the new developments to serve social purposes,\nsuch as housing for families with low-income, may be the grounds for a public private\npartnership.\nSuppose that a developer is interested in constructing apartment houses in a suburban town where zoning currently\nallows only single-family housing on one-acre lots. The developer has plans for constructing three buildings with ten\napartments each on a five-acre site. The expected cost per unit is $150,000 and the developer plans to lease the units\nfor $2,500/month. Operating expenses are expected to be $500/month per unit. The annual net income is therefore:\nAnnual net income = 10 units ($2,000 /month/unit) (12 months/year)\n= $240,000 per year\nSince each ten-unit building is expected to cost $1.5 million to construct, the expected ROI is expected to be\n$240,000/$1.5 million, or 16%. The developer's minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR) is 12%, so this is a very\nattractive proposition. However, unless the zoning is changed, the five-acre site will only be able to be used for five\nsingle-family houses. Without the zoning change, the developer would have to sell the recently acquired site and\nseek development rights elsewhere.\nThe town is interested in creating housing that will be suitable for low- and middle-income families. They thought\nthat it might be possible for the town to build low-income housing, which would be made available to town employees\nat a maximum rent of $1000 per month. They found that the construction costs for a five-unit building would be\n$160,000 per unit, with monthly operating costs of $600 per unit. The net rent per month would therefore be just\n$400. The town could sell bonds with an interest rate of 4%, so that the annual interest cost per unit would be 4%\n($160,000) = $6,400. The net rent of $400 per month or $4,800 per year would be insufficient to cover these interest\npayments. If the town went this route, they would have to include an additional $6,400 - $4,800 = $1,600 per unit in\nthe town's budget, which they would prefer not to do.\nThe town therefore approached the developer about the\npossibility of allocating some of the units in the proposed apartments to low-income residents whose rent would be\nset at $1,000 per month.\nThe first question is whether or not there is some basis for a partnership. To answer this, we need to determine the\nmaximum reduction in rent that the developer could accept while still earning an acceptable return on the project. To\nachieve a return of 12%, the developer needs an annual operating profit of $180,000 (12% of the $1.5 million\ninvestment), which is $60,000 less than the expected lease payments of $240,000 per year. Reducing the rent from\nthe market rate of $2,500 per month to the desired rate of $1,000 per month for a low-income resident would cause a\nloss of revenue of $1,500/month or $18,000/year for each unit. Thus, even if the developer had to make three units\navailable to town employees at the lower rent, he would still have an acceptable MARR:\nROI with 3 low-income units = ($240,000 - 3 x $18,000)/$1.5 million = 12.4%\nIf the developed is forced to decide between abandoning the project and accepting a project in which three units are\nreserved for low-income families paying lower rents, then the developer would likely accept the deal. Of course, the\ndeveloper would be likely to say \"if you provide a subsidy of $1,500 per month per unit ($18,000 per year), you could\nrent as many as you like.\"\n\nThe town would probably consider $1,600 per year as the maximum subsidy that they would consider, as they could\nbuild their own complex if they were willing to provide that level of subsidy. Thus they would be unwilling to provide\nanything close to the desired subsidy.\nOn the other hand, they could perhaps offer something else. Suppose the state had approved legislation aimed at\npromoting the development of low-income housing by allowing the state to guarantee the interest on loans associated\nwith constructing housing in which at least 25% of the units were reserved for qualifying low-income families. Under\nthis legislation, the interest rate on the developer's loans would drop by 2% if the development qualified. If the\ndeveloper had a loan of $1.5 million, a 2% reduction in the interest rate would be worth more than $30,000 per year.\nThis would be equivalent to $10,000 per unit if three units were reserved for low-income families.\nIs this enough to close the deal? Maybe and maybe not. It depends upon how badly the developer wants to proceed\nand how aggressive the town is willing to be in considering the re-zoning application. It is conceivable that some\nresidents in the town will prefer not to attract low-income families - and it is conceivable that others will be very\nsupportive of initiatives that allow young families and public employees to live in the town. Another step that could\nbe taken would be to allow the developer to add a couple of more units to each building, thereby making the overall\ndevelopment more attractive.\n\nCase Study\nThe Sheffield Flyover, Kansas City, Missouri1\nThis project illustrates how public agencies can work with the private sector to expand\ncapacity and improve the performance of the local transportation system, with benefits to\nthe region and the nation as well. This project, which had substantial public as well as\nprivate benefits, only became feasible when public agencies and the railroads figured out\nhow to work together and share the costs.\nOverview\nThe Sheffield Flyover increased the capacity and improved the performance of a major bottleneck in the rail network\nin and around Kansas City. At-grade crossings of high-density rail routes had not only led to train backups, but also\ncaused extensive delays to highway traffic when trains blocked local streets. An innovative public private partnership\nhelped secure funding for and ensure the successful implementation of the flyover. Because of the success of the\nSheffield Flyover, the railroads and public agencies decided to build a second major flyover in Kansas City in order\nto secure similar benefits.\nProject Description2\nThe project addressed a key bottleneck in the national rail system where the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF)\nmain line crossed the Union Pacific (UP) and Kansas City Southern (KCS) main lines. With 100 to 120 trains\noperating on the BNSF, 60 to 80 on the UP and KCS, and another 40 to 60 local trains operating in the area, this was\ndescribed as the \"third busiest railroad intersection in the country\". Trains were inevitably delayed as dispatchers\nworked to route them through the bottleneck; the delayed trains blocked highway intersections for a mile or more.\nThe resulting delays were especially difficult for trucks seeking to enter or exit a major industrial area hemmed in\nbetween the main lines.\nBy constructing a flyover, it was possible to eliminate rail and highway delays associated with train interference at the\ncrossovers. The project covered nearly three route-miles almost entirely constructed on the Kansas City Terminal\nRailroad's right-of-way; it included a main bridge of 6,740 feet and two other bridges of 890 and 150 feet. By double-\ntracking the flyover and keeping the existing tracks, it was possible to greatly increase the capacity of the intersection,\nthereby improving the flow of trains moving through Kansas City and also providing better service to local rail\ncustomers. From the public's perspective, the most visible benefit was expected to be a reduction in delays at grade\ncrossings. Transystems, a consulting firm involved in evaluating the project, estimated that an average of 530 vehicle-\nhours would be saved daily for cars and trucks by elimination of grade crossings, based upon the train volume, the\naverage time that each train blocked a crossing, and the 4,500 daily highway vehicle movements through the area. At\n$14/hour, this was estimated to amount to a savings of $1.85 million annually. In addition, with fewer trains and\nvehicles delayed in the area, emissions were expected to be sharply reduced.\nTransystems did not provide details on the railway benefits, but indicated they would be approximately three times as\ngreat as the public benefits. This is borne out by a quick assessment of the benefits from reduced train delay. If 150\n180 trains per day each saved 20 minutes in moving through this region (as estimated by Transystems), that would be\na savings of more than 60 hours of train delay per day or 20,000 per year. The cost per train-hour is commonly\nestimated to be on the order of $250/hour based upon the hourly cost of equipment ownership plus the opportunity\n1 This case study is based upon material prepared by C. D. Martland for the National Cooperative Highway Research Program as\nan example of public/private partnerships. The case study was part of the research conducted under research project NCHRP 8-42\n\"Rail Freight Solutions to Highway Congestion.\"\n2 Transystems Corporation, \"Kansas City Terminal Railway Flyover Project: A Public/Private Cooperative Success, Presentation\"\nto Financing Freight Transportation Improvements, FHWA Conference, St. Louis, MO, April 29, 2001\n\ncost associated with the loads themselves. Hence the delay cost of an average 20-minute delay to these trains would\nexceed $5 million per year.\nThe project cost was $75 million. Raising the capital was a stumbling block for the railroads, even though they were\nwilling to pay for the project on a continuing basis. Another problem was that construction would increase the assessed\nvalue of the property and therefore the property tax owed by the railroads. Various public agencies were interested in\nproviding financial support, but there were barriers to using public funds. At one point, it appeared that a Federal\nHighway Administration (FHWA) loan would be approved to finance 25% of the project, based upon the public's\nshare of the project benefits. This loan possibility fell through when trucking interests objected to the use of highway\ntrust money for rail projects. State agencies were interested, but were prohibited from investing in a private sector\nproject.\nThe financing problem was resolved by creating a \"Transportation Corporation,\" a quasi-governmental entity that can\nbe created under Missouri law that can receive highway funds. A \"T-CORP\" can issue 20-year, state tax exempt\nbonds to fund transport projects, and it receives real estate tax abatements. A \"T-CORP\" is represented jointly by the\nproject owner and the Missouri Highway Department\"; the T-CORP owns the land and the project until the loans are\npaid off, at which point the land goes back to the previous owners. The net result for the Sheffield Flyover was that\nthe T-CORP issued the bonds, the US DOT provided a letter of credit, and the railroads agreed to repay the loans. In\naddition to benefiting from low interest rates, the corporation enjoyed a property tax abatement worth $1.4 million per\nyear (estimated by Transystem as being nearly 20% of the annual amortization costs).\nThe project required a few other elements of cooperation. The project was supported by the Heartland Freight\nCoalition and the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Missouri Department of Transportation,\nFederal Highway Administration (FHWA), and the railroads. Some public land was needed for the flyover, and a\nland swap was arranged with the City. While the project was underway, work was done to modernize or coordinate\n14 different utilities serving this industrial area. Also, a portion of one of the city streets had to be reconstructed and\ntemporarily closed to enable completion of the flyover.\nMotivation\nKansas City is the second-largest rail freight hub in the country after Chicago. It is served by four Class I railroads:\n(Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF), Union Pacific (UP), Norfolk Southern (NS) and Kansas City Southern (KCS),\nwhile the Gateway Western provides an independent route that reaches CSX in St. Louis. The Kansas City Terminal\nRailroad provides local switching services, and various short line and switching railroads serve the area. The\nmetropolitan area has an intricate network of classification yards, industrial support yards, and through tracks. A\nmajor problem within the region is that major rail routes intersect in Kansas City, resulting in extensive delays to both\ntrains and highway vehicles.\nThe Mid-America Regional Council documented the importance of rail to the region.3 Rail handled just over half of\nthe freight tonnage moving through Kansas City. Over 80% of the rail freight was moving through the area, and this\ntraffic amounted to 150 million tons in 2000. Much of this traffic was intermodal (i.e. containers or trailers that are\ntransferred by truck between customers and intermodal terminals and moved by rail between the intermodal terminals).\nThe BNSF's route from Los Angeles to Chicago, which handles 1.6 million containers and trailers annually, goes right\nthrough Kansas City. Another 23 million rail tons was received by Kansas City industries, while about 11 million\ntons were shipped out by Kansas City shippers. Rail's market share varies greatly with the type of movement. Rail\naccounted for approximately two thirds of the freight moving into or though the region; truck accounted for all of the\nintra-regional freight and more than three quarters of the outbound freight. The rail share vs. truck was growing for\nthrough traffic, stable for traffic inbound to the region, and declining for outbound traffic.\n3 Mid-America Regional Council, \"Transportation Outlook 2030, Metropolitan Kansas City's Long-Range Transportation Plan\",\nMid-America Regional Council, October 2002\n\nDuring the 1990's, it became increasingly evident that various national trends in rail freight traffic were disrupting\nboth rail and highway traffic in the city. Rationalization of the network was concentrating more traffic on fewer\nroutes, leading to congestion and interference within the rail network, as well as increasing delays to highway traffic.\nTrains waiting for authorization to proceed through an intersection often blocked automobiles and trucks at grade\ncrossings, frequently for 20 minutes or longer. Mergers, traffic growth, and shifts in freight traffic patterns required\ngreater capacity along key rail routes within the city, but the bottlenecks where key routes intersected threatened to\nlimit growth of rail traffic.\nThe project therefore was seen to have both local and national significance. Grade crossings and local air quality were\nthe obvious benefits for the local area. However, the movement of 1.6 million trailers and containers by train rather\nthan by highway was recognized as much more than a local benefit, since these shipments might otherwise be moving\non the highways not just through Kansas City, but also through many other cities throughout the country. Expanding\nthe capacity of such an important rail hub was also of major significance for the national rail system. The 150 million\ntons of freight moving through the rail hub represented at least seven million truck shipments, including the intermodal\ntrailers and containers mentioned already. This is a good illustration of a network-level investment where important\nimprovements in system performance help retain existing customers and attract new customers.\nResults\nThe project achieved its goals. Following the opening of the new facility in 2000, travel times for trains dropped from\n40 to about 15 minutes.4 This improvement in train efficiency translated directly into the hoped-for reduction in grade\ncrossing delays and air quality. The institutional structure also worked well enough to be expanded. In February,\n2002, BNSF announced that a second major flyover would be constructed to provide grade separation at the\nintersection of two of their main routes and improve access to Argentine Yard, their major freight facility in the\nregion.5 (BNSF, 2/15/02). The \"Argentine Flyover\", which would cost about $60 million, was initiated using the same\ninstitutional arrangements as the Sheffield Flyover.\nThe project received broad recognition as an outstanding example of public/private cooperation. The Intermodal\nAdvisory Task Force of the Chicago Area Transportation Study identified this project as one of the best examples of\n\"holistic\" planning \"involving major transportation industries, the political decision-makers, plus the industries\n(shippers and receivers, essentially) that stood to benefit.\"6 Rawlings noted the key roles played by the Chamber of\nCommerce and the Mid-America Regional Council, who funded preliminary freight studies and were able to focus\ninterest on and achieve a consensus for the flyover and a few other critical projects.\nLessons Learned\nTable 1 summarizes the key elements of this project. In this case, the train volumes were so high and the benefits so\nlarge that it was easy for local parties to agree that the benefits justified the costs of the project. At intersections of\nbusy rail lines, trains back up and clearly block the local highway network. These local costs were easily identifiable\nand large enough to justify public participation, even though the national significance of the project is what motivated\nFHWA's interest. The benefits were equally clear to the railroads, as were the costs to operations if action were not\ntaken.\n4 Cookson, Brian, \"Railway putting flyover on track\", The Business Journal of Kansas City - November 5, 2001 (from the\nNovember 1, 2001 print edition).\n5 BNSF News Release, \"Second Flyover Bridge to Streamline Rail Traffic Through Kansas City,\" Kansas City, Kansas, February\n15, 2002.\n6 Rawlings, Gerald, comments posted on \"National Dialogue on Freight\" Website (referenced March 14, 2003).\n\nThis project provides various lessons for promoting public/private partnerships that seek to enhance a system in order\nto achieve both local and national benefits:\n-\nThe involvement and support of the local interests is essential.\n-\nThe willingness of the various partners to work together and to negotiate ways to share the costs is essential.\n-\nFederal, state and local cooperation can provide innovative financing mechanism and enable a complex project\nto be completed quickly.\n-\nEnvironmental benefits may provide part of the story in support of the project, but the financing may need to be\nbased upon a clear understanding that the system improvements - both local and national - translate directly into\nenough cost savings to justify the project.\n-\nThe national scope of the project may add to the story and motivate federal involvement, but it may not directly\naffect the local assessment of the project. In other locations, where the local effects are not so evident, it may be\nnecessary to make a stronger case for the indirect and national benefits in order to secure local support and a\nbroader base of funding.\n-\nOnce a coalition is formed to identify, finance, and implement projects that fulfill clear needs, then that coalition\ncan quickly move on to additional projects.\nTable 1 Key Elements of the Kansas City Flyover Project\nReason for PPP\nProject justified by the combination of public and private benefits, and it required innovative\ncooperative relationships for implementation.\nWhat was done\nRail lines and some public property were conveyed to a special public agency that constructed\nflyovers that eliminated some of the main at-grade rail-rail and rail-highway crossings in\nKansas City.\nBenefits\nFinancial: the railroads reduced their operating costs.\nEconomic: reduction in delays to highway traffic at grade crossings.\nFinancing\nLow-interest bonds and property tax abatement: the project was financed with low-interest\ntax-fee bonds, which would be paid back by the railroads in proportion to their use of the\nfacility. By transferring the land to the city, the railroads would not have to pay property tax.\nMajor risks\n1. Would construction costs be higher than predicted?\n2. Would traffic volumes be high enough to produce enough revenue to cover the annualized\ncosts of the project? This risk was thought to be minimal, as this region was the second-\nbusiest rail hub in the country.\n\nCase Study\nSkyscrapers and Building Booms\nYou and your directors were well advised in the choice of your symbol. For a tower, with its light\nand its belfry, has always been a source of inspiration. ... Thus your Tower partakes of the\ncharacter of the ancient towers of refuge and defense ... Your high tower should, therefore, be a\nsymbol of God to you and others, standing out boldly and erect as a plea for righteousness and\npurity in business corporations, and as a monumental protest against the exploitation of the poor.1\nThe technologies necessary to construct buildings of almost unlimited height became available in the mid- to late-19th\ncentury. In locations where land values were high, the potential benefits of building a skyscraper were immediately\nobvious. While the visceral appeal of towers may have appealed to certain visionaries, overly powerful executives\nand politicians, the ability to replace a 5-story building with a 25-story building excited the financial instincts of\ndevelopers and real estate agents. Whether buildings were designed for office space or for apartments, the ability to\nrent far more building space on the same site was a prospect too enticing to resist.\n.\nTable 1 Technological Innovations Required for the Construction of Skyscrapers\nSteel frames\nJames Bogardus demonstrates how to use cast-iron posts and beams to support a\nbuilding without relying upon the walls, but height is limited to 7 or 8 stories.\nUsing steel rather cast-iron allows framing much higher buildings because steel\nis more flexible, stronger, and can be joined with rivets rather than nuts and bolts.\nLeroy Buffington shows how tall steel-framed buildings could be built.\nWilliam Le Baron Jenny uses Buffington's method in design for the first\nskyscraper, the Home Insurance Company Building in Chicago, which was built\nusing a steel frame rather than using steel to reinforce thick masonry walls.\nElevator\nGraves Otis demonstrates an elevator at the Crystal Palace in London.\nEquitable Building in NYC is first building to install an elevator.\nOtis installs the first electric elevator.\nUtilities\nWater for fire protection and sanitation.\nElectricity for elevators and lighting.\nFire protection\nBuilding codes call for fire-retardant materials, fire escapes, sprinkler systems,\ninspections and fire drills.\nZoning\nZoning is required to deal with effect of buildings on wind currents and sunlight.\nSource of information: John Tauranac, The Empire State Building, St. Martin's Griffin, NY, 1995\nThe pace at which skyscrapers were erected in New York City was astonishing (Tauranac, pp. 41-42). In the 1890s,\nseveral 20-30 story buildings were constructed in the city. By 1929, there were 188 that were more than 20 stories\ntall and nearly 2,500 that were more than 10 stories tall. In 1899, the 29-story Park Row Building was the tallest in\nthe world; the world record was broken three more times in the next fourteen years in Manhattan, capped in 1913 by\nthe 55-story, 787-foot high Woolworth building. During the 1920s, the Chrysler Building, at 1,048 feet held the record\nfor a while until it was surpassed by the Empire State Building, which had 102 stories and was more than 1,250 feet\ntall.\nThis incredible construction boom in Manhattan was fueled by the fact that skyscrapers allowed many more people\nand businesses to crowd into an area with some of the highest property values in the world. The new technology made\nit possible to house an order of magnitude more people than could previously be housed on a site. Once developers\nrealized the profits that could be made by rebuilding the city to a taller standard, the proposals and construction efforts\n1 This bit of hyperbole was addressed to Met Life stockholders in 1915 according to John Tauranac, The Empire State Building,\nSt. Martin's Griffin, NY, 1995 p. 38. The president of Met Life was apparently more concerned with his pocketbook than with\nhis view, as he is reported to have responded by saying \"the tenants will foot the bill.\"\n\nmultiplied - even after vacancy rates started to increase in 1926 and a report to President Coolidge concluded that the\ncountry was overbuilt. According to Tauranac:\nDevelopers had been desperate to develop, but by 1927 they were desperate to rent, to fill their vacancies,\nespecially in apartment houses where the problem was critical. ... Realtors recognized that the profession\ncould not view the extremely heavy construction program without apprehension of a glut on the market. (p.\n83)\nDespite the slump and the dire warning, in both 1928 and 1929, developers filed plans for more than 700 new buildings\nin New York City. And some of these were quite spectacular plans. The planning for the Empire State Building and\nfor Rockefeller Center were both initiated in this ambiguous period, still at the height of the construction boom, but\njust before the bottom was about to fall out of not just the New York City real estate market, but out of the worldwide\neconomy.\nThe pace of construction seen in New York City in the 1920s was later replicated in many other locations around the\nworld, notably Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai and Dubai. Unfortunately, the instincts that cause developers to begin\nbigger and better projects are also perhaps too powerful to resist, even in the face of contrary economic evidence. The\nreal estate bubble that burst in 2008 was linked to the same kinds of \"irrational exuberance\" and shaky financial\ndealings that led to the burst of the bubble in New York City in 1929.\nOnce a real estate bubble bursts, it may be years before development resumes. In the United States and elsewhere,\nconstruction of skyscrapers stalled because of the depression and World War II. Only after the war was it possible to\nresume construction of skyscrapers. As in the earlier period, technological and economic forces shaped what was built\n(see text box).\n\nI began my career in structural engineering in 1947 and was in responsible charge of structural design\nof many notable high rise buildings including two of the world's highest over the next 40 years. I can attest to this\nperiod as one of great technological change in building design. Allowable stresses were increased by about a\nthird and new high strength steel was developed and more precise methods of computation with computers were\nused to solve structural problems with speed and accuracy. Architects were anxious to express new concepts of\nmodern design and postmodern design. The light aluminum and glass exterior curtain wall was developed and\nthe \"glass box\" building was born. \"Less is more\" was a popular theme. Thus we had as the state of the art\nlight-weight steel frames with glass and metal curtain walls. The new designs provided for large column free\nspace around the central core of the buildings. The tube design was developed providing long span truss floor\nsystems between closely spaced exterior wall columns and a grid of columns in the building core which housed\nelevators, stairways, mechanical shafts and wash rooms. Horizontal mechanical systems ran parallel and through\nthe open spaces in the trusses and the structural steel was fireproofed with sprayed on asbestos cement material.\nAfter asbestos became a dirty word, other cementatious spray-on material was developed. ...\nMoney was the primary mechanism which drove these changes. We had to build economically to offset\nthe increasing costs of both labor and materials. Cost saving was the name of the game and engineers were\nnotable by their ability to carry out the ever-changing design concepts of the architects with as little tonnage of\nstructural steel as possible. For example, in the pre-World War II era, buildings in the 25 to 50 story range had\nsteel in the order of 20 to 40 pounds per square foot. The post War buildings in the 40 to 100 story ranges had\nsteel weights in the order of 30 pounds per square foot. There were no catastrophic failures of these structures\nfrom fire, impact or explosions until 9/11.\nWhat we do next involves the answers to many questions and numerous decisions by participants in the\ndesign and construction process, government and concerned public. Certainly examination of fireproofing\nsystems and structural details is a high priority, including where possible the retrofitting of existing structures.\nModification of zoning ordinances limiting height and location of high buildings and changes in building codes\nrelative to fire, explosion, and impact safety should be considered. All this involves not only technical but also\npolitical and cultural considerations. 9/11, while a terrible tragedy, should serve as a wake-up signal for a more\nsecure building environment in this new era of terrorist war.\nPerhaps the day of megastructures in the United States is and should be over for many reasons other than\nsafety.\nConcentration of thousands of people in a single structure has serious infrastructure effects on\ntransportation systems and the environment. Time is wasted and people suffer from over-stress as they rush like\nants each working day into their workplace often from homes hours away. I, having been there, seen it and done\nit, think there are better answers to housing the core operations of commerce than trying to make megastructures\nsafe, efficient and healthy workplaces.\nE. Alfred Picardi, P.E., ASCE, May 5, 2002\n\nCase Study\nEvolution of the U.S. Rail System\nThe railroads have experienced what is likely a typical life cycle for infrastructure-based systems,\nfrom revolutionary to dominant to mature to declining to decommissioning. The rail industry's\nevolution over a period of nearly 200 years therefore provides insights into the types of problems\nthat are encountered - or are likely to be encountered - by other infrastructure-based systems.\nOverview\nIn the mid-19th century, the rail industry in the United States consisted of hundreds of tiny companies. Over a century\nand a half, these companies slowly consolidated into today's coordinated system that is dominated by four mega-\ncarriers. Regulation and government support, initially required to avoid overdevelopment and monopolistic excess,\neventually was required to help the industry reduce its network, recover from bankruptcies, and abandon large\nsegments of business that were better served by other modes of transportation. Today, while railroads clearly have\nadvantages over highway and airline competitors in terms of fuel efficiency and emissions, these advantages do not\nnecessarily mean that railroads will capture more traffic. Technological advances have been critical in allowing the\nrailroads to remain competitive - and even dominant - in some markets. Understanding where the industry retains\nclear advantages has allowed the railroads to segment their markets and focus on the most promising areas: intermodal\ntraffic and bulk traffic. Effective public policy and continuing public support may be needed to sustain the rail system,\nespecially for passenger transportation.\nIntroduction of Railroads in the Early 19th Century1\nThe introduction of railroads provided an incredible improvement in mobility and a dramatic reduction in the cost of\nmoving freight. Cheap transportation plus the rapid advances of the industrial revolution spurred economic growth in\nthe early 19th century. In the US, railroads were instrumental in opening up vast areas for development, both in terms\nof making land available for farmers and ranchers and providing access to new hotels in prime locations for rich\ntourists.\n\"The steam engine, the railroad locomotive, the transatlantic steamship, the telegraph, and the camera together\nvirtually completed the conquest of nature by the go-ahead age. What followed were in effect refinements. ...\nEven the increasingly anticipated conquest of the air would, in essence, be no more than an added convenience.\nIts effect was simply to turn days into hours. It was the shortening of months into days by the railroads that was\nthe basic revolution in transportation.\"\nPage Smith, The Nation Comes of Ages, A People's History of the Ante-Bellum Years, p. 819\nState and local governments at first tried to hold off the railroads, as they wanted to protect their investments in canals.\nOver time, the legal impediments to railroad building were struck down by courts or repealed by state legislatures,\nand by the middle of the 19th century, the railroads had an irresistible momentum. Small lines constantly consolidated\nin an effort to increase their access to capital and improve their service. New lines were established, and as soon as\nthey proved themselves (or went bankrupt) they were taken up by larger lines and incorporated into a \"system.\" Boston\nentrepreneurs, who had no serious opportunities for building canals, financed railroads to compete with New York\nCity's advantageous Erie Canal route to the Northwest Territories. By 1850, Boston had links as far as Ohio and\nthroughout New England. Three thousand miles of rail line were built for $70 million, and it was profitable.\nThe history of the rail industry is well-documented. The facts in this sub-section were obtained from Page Smith, The Nation\nComes of Ages, A People's History of the Ante-Bellum Years, pp. 271-277.\n\nThe emphasis quickly shifted from trying to prevent to trying to promote railroad development, especially in the\nMississippi Valley region, where vast expanses of lands were unsold and unsettled because of their distance from\nmarkets. Illinois gave the Central Illinois RR 2.6 million acres of land to help finance construction, because costs had\nrun $10 million over budget. This land was initially worth $0.16 per acre (i.e. about $430 thousand). Five years later,\nit was worth $10/acre; 10 years after that it was worth $30 an acre and a total of $78 million total. It was possible to\nget mortgages on the land in order to finance the construction of the railroads.\nGeneral economic trends were at times driven by and at times disastrous for the railroads. Construction of new lines\nled to a surge in demand for timber, iron, and coal. General cycles of boom and bust rapidly followed one upon the\nother. In the latter part of the 19th century, two thirds of the years were severe recessions or depressions. Competition\namong railroads was fierce, and bankruptcies were common. Potential problems such as air pollution from the coal-\nburning locomotives or the destruction of pristine areas and the division of cities did not impede the progress of the\nrailroads.\nProblems Emerge: Accidents, Greed, and Corruption\nRailroading was a dangerous occupation, as there were many injuries resulting from collisions, derailments, and\nmistakes in switching cars in yards. Over time, improvements in brakes, in coupling systems, in signaling and\ncommunications, in track materials and vehicle design all contributed to dramatic reductions in the risks associated\nwith rail operations.\nRail lines that were built to open up new regions to development could not be justified in terms of the revenues that\nwould be received from operations. Before the railroad was built, there was little or no development, and until there\nwas development, there would be little or no traffic. For this reason, government funds, loans, guarantees of railway\nbonds and land grants were used to finance the many lines in the Midwest and also the first transcontinental rail line.\nThe government investment was justified by the potential social and economic benefits of development and, especially\nin the case of the transcontinental railroad, the strategic need to link California and with the rest of the country. The\nfinancial logic was that the railroad company could use the loans, mortgage the land or sell the bonds to obtain the\ncash required to build the rail line. Once the rail line was built, the railroad could repay the loans from land sales,\noperating profits, or by carrying government officials and freight at a discount. After completion of the railroad,\nalthough the government had given away large quantities of land, the remaining land was far more valuable.\nThe railroads that built the transcontinental railroad received land valued at $392 million as of 1880, after the railroad\nwas built. The government's land alongside the rail route had presumably appreciated by nearly that much. The\nrailroads had been allowed to issue government-back bonds with a face-value of $63 million, and they paid back that\namount plus $105 million in interest. Thus, the government's investment in the venture turned out to be very\nprofitable.2\nUnfortunately, rapid expansion of the rail network and access to vast amounts of public money led to various types of\nfraud: misuse of the funds intended for rail construction, construction of rail lines to too high or low a standard, and\nconstruction of very expensive lines along questionable routes. In developing the railroads in the northeast, the\nprofitability of railroads attracted unscrupulous investors and politicians eager to capture their share of the bonanza.\nDeals involving railroad barons such as the Goulds and politicians such as the Tweeds in New York City were\ninfamous, as were the battles and stock manipulations of rival financiers. As the rail network moved into the west,\nthe need for public support was much greater than it had been in the east. And the opportunity for corruption was\nmuch greater.\nThe greatest scandal of the scandalous Grant administration (1869-1977) involved the construction of the\ntranscontinental railroad. The Union Pacific and the Western Pacific railroads received construction grants from the\nUS government plus land grants along the right-of-way to help finance the construction of the first transcontinental\n2 Ambrose, Nothing Like It in the World, p. 377\n\nrailroad. They were able to mortgage the land prior to construction based upon the value of the land after the\nconstruction in order to raise capital for construction. The UP owners did this through a French bank, Credit Mobilier,\nwhich they controlled. The bank declared as dividends the great majority of the funds deposited by the UP owners,\nwho in effect defrauded the railroad and the government. Many US officials, including the Vice President, were\nimplicated in the scandal.\nAnother type of fraud was to construct lines that were unnecessarily expensive to build, in order to provide larger\nprofits to the contractors. Mark Twain captured the essence of this strategy in his marvelously cynical portrayal of\n\"The Gilded Age:\"\nBeautiful Road. Look at that, now. Perfectly straight line - straight all the way to the grave. And see where\nit leaves Hawkeye - clear out in the cold, my dear, clear out in the cold. That town's as bound to die as\nwell if I owned it I'd get its obituary ready, now, and notify the mourners. Polly, mark my words - in three\nyears from this, Hawkeye'll be a howling wilderness. You'll see. And just look at that river - noblest stream\nthat meanders over the thirsty earth! - calmest, gentlest artery that refreshes her weary bosom! Railroad\ngoes all over it and all through it - wades along on stilts. Seventeen bridges in three miles and a half\nforty-nine bridges from Hark-from-the-Tomb to Stone's Landing altogether - forty-nine bridges, and\nculverts enough to represent them all - but you get an idea - perfect trestle-work of bridges for seventy-two\nmiles. Jeff Thompson and I fixed all that, you know; he's to get the contracts and I'm to put them through\non the divide. Just oceans of money in those bridges. It's the only part of the railroad I'm interested in,\ndown along the line - and it's all I want, too. It's enough, I should judge.\nMark Twain, The Gilded Age, Chap. 27\nMonopolistic Excess and Regulation of Railroads\nFraud, monopolistic excesses in pricing, fatal accidents and cut-throat competition eventually created a situation in\nwhich it was both necessary and possible to regulate the railroads.3 So long as the railroads were unregulated, they\nwere able to charge what the market could bear, which led to high prices and shipper complaints during periods of\neconomic growth and bankruptcy for the railroads and loss of railroad jobs during recessions.\nInitial attempts to regulate railroads were driven by several factors: inflation during the Civil War (1861-1865),\ndeclining agricultural prices during the depression of the 1870s, rapid settlement of the west, and decline in demand\nfor grain overseas. Between 1871 and 1874, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota enacted the so-called \"Granger\nLaws\". These laws, though struck down in 1878 by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional, provided some examples\nthat were followed in subsequent regulations of railroads:\n-\nEstablishment of maximum rates\n-\nCreation of state railroad commissions to prescribe maximum rates\n-\nRequiring pro rata rates (proportional to mileage) for the same class of goods\n-\nRestrictions on mergers\nRegulation of the railroads was finally adopted at the federal level by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) Act\nof 1887. The ICC was given the power to regulate rates, which were required to be \"just and reasonable\" and non\ndiscriminatory. Rates were required to be published, so that everyone could see whether or not they were fair.\nAdditional legislation was needed to correct defects and omissions in the ICC Act to further protect the shipper\n3 For an excellent discussion of the economic and political factors that led to regulation, plus a detailed description of the first 75\nyears of rail regulation, see D. Philip Locklin, \"Economics of Transportation,\" 6th edition, Richard D. Irwin, Inc., Homewood,\nIL,1966, which is the source of the information on regulation presented in this section.\n\nThe financial zenith of the rail industry was reached in the late 19th and early 20th century. The railroads basically had\na monopoly on intercity transportation, and people and companies were willing and able to pay rail fares and freight\nrates. Regulation had eliminated discrimination in rates, but it had not generally resulted in lower rates.\nHowever, the glitter was coming off the rail industry. Roads were being improved so as to allow rapidly improving\nautomobiles and trucks to cut into the railroad's monopoly. The U.S. involvement in World War I brought about a\nperiod of very intensive use and very little maintenance of the rail system. In order to coordinate operations and to\nmaximize the efficiency of the system, the federal government took control of the railroads from December 28, 1917\nuntil March 1, 1920.4 By the time that the railroads were returned to private operation after the war, they were in very\npoor physical shape, and many lacked the financial resources needed to recuperate. It was evident that there was a\n\"strong railroad - weak railroad\" problem. The strong railroads were more efficient, had better routes and served more\ncustomers. Competition among the strong railroads established the rate structure in many markets; weak railroads,\nwith higher costs or second-rate routes, could not compete. With competition among the railroads driving prices down\nto levels where some railroads could not make any profits, the government recognized a need to help the industry.\nThe Transport Act of 1920 provided some financial assistance to the railroads, established minimum rates as a way to\navoid mutually destructive rate wars, and revised regulations related to rates and operations.\nOver the next 15 years, the fortunes of the rail industry continued to decline, and the industry began to face serious\nproblems that would persist for decades. The weak railroad problem remained unsolved, and many railroads went\ninto bankruptcy. Truck competition captured some of the industry's most profitable freight traffic, and automobiles\nand airlines sharply cut the railroads' passenger traffic. Although the network was clearly overbuilt, with too many\nyards and lines, it was very difficult to consolidate facilities and the public challenged most attempts to abandon lines.\nWith declining profits and bankruptcy, railroads had increasing difficulty in raising capital to upgrade equipment and\nfacilities. Operating efficiency was hampered by work rules, many of which had been negotiated with the unions at a\ntime when the industry had been much more profitable, with different types of traffic, and more labor-intensive\ntechnology. Labor agreements made it very difficult to modify wages or work rules.\nWorld War II provided a brief period in which the railroads once again became the dominant transport mode, as the\nfederal government limited the use of gasoline and rubber for private travel. However, the trends toward trucks,\nautomobiles, and air travel continued after the war, and the problems that had become evident during the depression\nremained unsolved, leading to pressure for further government intervention in the rail industry. The bankruptcy of\nthe Penn Central in 1969 precipitated what was known as the Northeast Rail Crisis. The Penn Central had been formed\nonly a few years earlier by the merger of two of the largest railroads, the New York Central and the Pennsylvania, and\neven on the eve of its bankruptcy it was viewed as a financially solid company. When it declared bankruptcy, it sent\nshock waves throughout the rail industry and the financial community. According to the Penn Central, the causes of\ntheir problems were four-fold: excessive labor costs because of union work rules and pay scales that reflected an era\nwhen railroads were dominant and operations were more labor intensive; inability to abandon unprofitable light\ndensity lines; losses in providing passenger service; and maximum rate regulation.\nIn the early 1970s, further bankruptcies, spectacular accidents involving hazardous materials, equipment shortages\nand disputes over light density lines highlighted the need for federal action to preserve the industry. The federal\ngovernment faced three options for dealing with the crisis: nationalization of the bankrupt railroads, government\nfunded rationalization of the system, and liquidation. Most in Congress were afraid of nationalization, because of the\nhigh cost of acquiring the railroads, while railroads and their customers feared political interference, especially with\nrespect to consolidating lines and terminals and abandoning light density lines. Congress, railroads, customers, and\nlocal government officials were all afraid of liquidation, because nobody knew what would happen.\nCongress eventually passed legislation that led to the government's acquisition of most of the lines owned by the Penn\nCentral and several smaller bankrupt carriers, which were then merged into a new railroad called Conrail. Congress\n4 Locklin, p. 225\n\nwas able to act because rail labor and rail shippers strongly supported providing help to the industry. The government\ninvested several billion dollars in upgrading Conrail's equipment and facilities in addition to paying several billion\nfor the lines that were incorporated into Conrail.\nCongress also dealt with the other problems highlighted by Penn Central by shifting passenger operations in 1971 to\na new entity called Amtrak, relaxing regulation, instituting new procedures for line abandonment, and providing\nmechanisms to assist in gradual reduction of the labor force.\nDeregulation of the Railroads\nWhile congress was still grappling with the Northeast Rail Crisis, the rail problems spread to the mid-west. In the\nmid-1970s, Congress was being urged to do something to respond to the collapse of the granger roads - Milwaukee\nRoad, Illinois Central Gulf, Rock Island, and other, smaller roads serving the region. There was some support for re\ndoing the Conrail process by creating a \"FARMRAIL\", but this was rejected as too expensive. Conrail was clearly\ngoing to cost the government more than $5 billion, and Congress had had enough of such spending.\nA labor strike on the Rock Island precipitated a crisis. Instead of intervening to keep the railroad operating, the\ngovernment allowed the Rock Island to cease operation. The railroad sold its best assets to other railroads, which\nturned out to be quite a good way to break up a railroad. The big losers in this were the union members who lost their\njobs when the road went out of business.\nThe Carter Administration was, in general, pushing for deregulation as a way to end protection of major industry and\nto lower prices for the consumer. Allowing railroads to have pricing freedom was viewed as better than loss of service,\nby both shippers and local governments.\nThe end result was the passage of the Staggers Act in 1980, which eliminated much of the regulation of the rail\nindustry. This act eliminated rate regulation for most types of rail shipments, allowed contract rates, and created new\nregulations aimed at expediting line abandonments and mergers. Deregulation, depending upon one's perspective,\npromoted innovative marketing by the railroads or led to discriminatory abuses such as those seen in the 19th century.\nEven railroad executives who normally claimed the former perspective sometimes admitted to the latter:\n\"The best source I have for pricing ideas is in the court cases concerning pricing abuses prior to the creation\nof the ICC.\"5\nTechnological Innovation\nDeregulation was one of several factors that allowed the railroads to remain profitable at the end of the 20th century.\nA second factor included negotiations with unions that allowed trains to be operated with two or three crew members\nrather than four or more, as well as other changes in union agreements that allowed more productive use of employees.\nA third major factor was technological improvement, including the remarkable advances in telecommunications and\ncomputers as well as improvements in railroad technology. Introduction of computers and advanced communications\nenabled the railroads to centralize their administrative activities, eliminate vast number of clerical positions, and\nincrease the ability of managers to control operations over larger networks. Advances in rail technology included\ncontinuing improvements in materials and design for both track and vehicles, as well as intensive development of two\ntypes of rail services:\n-\nUnit trains are used to transport large quantities of coal, ore, grain or other bulk commodities directly from\norigin to destination. Unit trains provide the cheapest of rail transportation, because they are very efficient\n5 Mark Hodak, Conrail marketing executive, explaining to my class on Freight Transportation Management how he studied rail\nrate discrimination in the 19th century to understand how his railroad could benefit from the deregulation of most rail freight rates\nin 1980.\n\nin terms of fuel, equipment utilization, and labor requirements. By capitalizing on what railroads do best,\nunit trains enable railroads to compete very effectively with barges moving on the inland waterway system\nand with heavy trucks operating on limited access highways.\n-\nIntermodal operations involve the transportation of trailers or containers by rail, truck, and ocean carrier.\nBy using a trailer or container, it is possible to transfer freight very easily from one mode to another, so that\nit is possible to take advantage of each mode's capabilities. Trucks are best at moving freight short distances\nto and from customers. Railroads are best at moving trainloads of freight long distances; and ocean carriers\nare best at moving freight long distances across the oceans. A major breakthrough in intermodal operations\ncame about in the 1980s when the ocean shipping lines and the railroads developed the double-stack container\ntrain, which allowed twice as many containers to be carried at about half the cost per container. This dramatic\nreduction in cost was possible only if intermodal terminals used expensive lift equipment at terminals and\nservice could only be provided on routes that had sufficient clearances for the much higher trains (Figure 1).\nThe potential for lower costs sparked a great many projects to build new intermodal terminals and to increase\nclearances on most of the major rail routes in the country. Double-stack trains made it possible for railroads\nto handle rapidly growing amounts of international freight as well as domestic freight such as that moved by\nUPS.\nFigure 1 A double stack container train entering Union\nPacific's Terminal in North Platte, Nebraska.\nThe containers were loaded in Asia, shipped across the Pacific by American President\nLines, and transferred to Union Pacific at a west coast port. They would ultimately\nbe delivered by trucks to customers in the eastern portion of the country.\n-\nHeavy Haul Railroading: In 1985, the rail industry initiated a long-term research program aimed at\nreducing life-cycle costs for heavy freight operations. The program included laboratory testing, and\nmonitoring of track deterioration at various locations on railroads around the country and the operation of a\ntest track in Pueblo, Colorado known as the Facility for Accelerated Service Testing (FAST). The results of\nthe tests enabled researchers to quantify the effects of heavier loads and better suspension systems on the\ndeterioration rates and life cycle costs of the track structure.6 Operating trains with heavier cars allows\n6 Hargrove, Michael B., Thomas S. Guins, and Carl D. Martland. Economics of Increased Axle Loads - Fast/HAL Results.\nReport No. LA-007. Association of American Railroads, October 1996.\n\nrailroads to save money related to fuel, crews, and equipment by moving more freight in each train. The AAR\nresearch program concluded that these operating benefits were greater than the added costs for the track\ninfrastructure, and the industry decided to increase the maximum allowable axle loads from 33 to 36 tons.\nThe heavier limits allow fewer trains to handle the same traffic, which not only reduces operating costs, it\nalso reduces congestion in moving trains in and out of the most active coal mining regions, notably the\nPowder River Basin in Wyoming.\nSummary\nThis case study provides an overview of the evolution of the rail industry in the United States. Portions of the rail\nsystem have gone through all of the stages of evolution of infrastructure systems, from initial testing of new\ntechnologies, to uncoordinated expansion, to consolidation, to retrenching and obsolescence. The system that remains\ntoday is far different from the one that dominated both passenger and freight transportation during the 19th century.\nMost of the smaller shipments and short-distance freight has been diverted to truck, and many once profitable rail\nlines have been abandoned or converted to rail trails. Many rail yards and terminals have been converted to other\nuses. Faced with competition from other modes, the railroads had to invest in the portions of their systems where they\nhad the chance to remain competitive. Because of investment in new types of freight cars, better locomotives,\nimproved signal systems, and more durable track structures, railroads remain the most economical way to move large\nshipments of bulk commodities such as grain or coal. Railroads also work with truckers and ocean carriers to move\ncontainers around the country and around the world, a type of transportation that is dependent upon investment in new\ntypes of container ships and terminals where automated equipment can be used to transfer containers from one mode\nto another.\nThe rail industry has great promise for selected services, including high speed passenger service, heavy haul freight\nand intermodal. Continuing advances in communications, control and materials are likely to provide further\nimprovements in productivity, thereby helping the financial sustainability of the industry. Increasing public interest\nin the environmental benefits of rail may help ensure the public support necessary to maintain and expand rail service.\nLessons from the History of Railroads\nSome of the lessons that can be learned from the experience of the railroads are as follows:\n-\nNew technology may enable a proliferation of new products that will be implemented without sufficient\nconsideration of what will ultimately be recognized as the best system design.\n-\nCompetition is likely to arise for any technology and for any system. Who prospers in a competitive\nenvironment will be whoever best serves the customers within the existing regulatory framework. Just\nbecause a technology is more fuel-efficient, requires less land, or has a lower impact on the environment does\nnot mean that the technology will prosper.\n-\nCareful analysis can help determine what kinds of system improvements will be most helpful and how best\nto implement new technologies.\n-\nGovernment regulation is a very important factor for infrastructure-based systems, both because of the high-\nfixed costs and the longevity of such systems. Government regulation of prices may be necessary to avoid\ndestructive competition, and government funding may be necessary to allow a system with clear public\nbenefits to be constructed or enhanced over time. Government support and regulation may also be helpful in\nallowing a gradual restriction of service over a slowly diminishing network rather than a collapse of service\nthat would cause tremendous socio-economic problems for users and communities.\n-\nAs a system ages, it may be necessary to abandon facilities and services that previously were profitable in\norder to continue to be able to maintain and operate facilities and services that remain profitable.\n\nCase Study\nRehabilitating Newark's 19th Century Brick Sewers\nInfrastructure systems can last not only for decades, but for centuries - but only if they are well\nmaintained.\nA plan for rehabilitating a system may encompass many separate projects\nundertaken over a period of many years. Setting priorities is essential for establishing a cost-\neffective program aimed at reducing risks and improving performance.\nIn 1990, the city of Newark, NJ embarked on a 20-year program to inspect and, when necessary, to rehabilitate its 68\nmiles of brick sewers that were more than a century old. Old sewers are prone to fail, with consequences ranging\nfrom the high costs of emergency repairs to disruptions to residents and businesses to collapse of city streets and\npossible impacts on public health. The program involved six phases. Each phase involved the inspection of a portion\nof the system, determination of what kinds of repairs were needed, and completion of those repairs. As part of Phase\nVI some of the sections that were first evaluated in the Phases I and II were re-evaluated.\nTable 1 Newark's Six-Phase Program to Rehabilitate its Brick Sewers\nPhase\nYears\nMiles\nInspected\nMiles\nRehabilitated\nCost\n($millions)\nMajor Source of Funds\nI\n1990-92\n13.2\n4.2\n$11.1\nLow interest loans from New\nJersey\nII\n1993-96\n12.6\n5.5\n$12.9\nLow interest loans from New\nJersey\nIII & IV\n1997-08\n21.3\n12.1\n$24\nGrant from U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency\nV\n7.0\n5.2\n$19\nLoan from New Jersey\nDepartment of Environmental\nProtection\nVI\n(Planned)\n2009-11\n23.8\n4.5\n$16\nLoan from New Jersey\nDepartment of Environmental\nProtection\nTotal\n1990-2011\n31.5\n$83\nThe inspection of the sewers produced numerous measures and photographs that documented the condition of the\nsystem, and this information was used to grade each segment of the system1:\n-\nGrade 1: acceptable.\n-\nGrade 2: minimal potential for short-term collapse, but further degradation is probable.\n-\nGrade 3: collapse is unlikely in the near term, but further deterioration is likely.\n-\nGrade 4: in some locations, collapse is likely in the near future.\n-\nGrade 5: collapse has already occurred or is imminent in some locations.\nPriorities for repair also took into consideration the effect of a collapse on the surrounding environment. Three levels\nof risk were considered:2\n-\nCritical A sewers: the cost of failure and the impact of a failure on the surrounding environment would\nboth be great.\n1 The grading technique was based upon The Sewerage Rehabilitation Manual, Water Resource Centre, Swindon, UK, 1994 edition.\nSimilar grading techniques have been developed for other kinds of structures, including bridges, highway pavements, and the\ncomponents of the railway track structure.\n2 The classification technique is described in Existing Sewer Evaluation and Rehabilitation, ASCE Press, Reston, VA 1994.\n\n-\nCritical B sewers: the risk is less, but preventive action would still be cost effective.\n-\nCritical C sewers: failure would have little or no effect unless there were numerous simultaneous\nfailures.\nSince all of the brick sewers were located under city streets, they were all considered to be critical A sewers. To\nmanage the rehabilitation work, contracts were let for 18 separate projects, which allowed work to be done in\nreasonably-sized pieces and staggered over a reasonable time period.\nThe main benefit of the program is that the city's brick sewers, once renovated, can be expected to perform their\nservices for another hundred years, with much reduced need for future maintenance and emergency repairs and with\nvastly reduced risks related to public health or collapsed roads. Similar programs have been undertaken in other cities,\nsometimes combined with efforts to separate rain water from sanitary wastes in order to avoid polluting waterways\n(Figure 1).\nLessons to be learned from this example include the following:\n-\nA program to upgrade existing infrastructure may require decades to complete.\n-\nInspection can determine where infrastructure is most in need of rehabilitation.\n-\nRisks associated with failure will vary depending upon the nature of the surrounding areas.\n-\nIt will not be necessary to rehabilitate or replace all of the infrastructure, as many sections are likely to be\nin good condition or in locations where failure will not cause any significant problems.\n-\nPriorities for rehabilitation are highest for portions of the infrastructure that are in the poorest condition and\nthat are located in areas where failure would have the greatest consequences.\nFigure 1 Separating Storm Sewers from Regular\nSewers on Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA\nIn Cambridge and Boston, as in many cities with 19th\ncentury sewer systems, when heavy rains over-taxed the\nsystem's capacity to handle the combined mixture of\nsanitary waste and rain water, the noisome excess\npoured was diverted directly into the nearby rivers or the\nocean. As part of various projects aimed at cleaning up\nthe Charles River and Boston Harbor, the two cities\nworked to develop separate systems for storm water, so\nthat only rain water would be discharged into the\nwaterways.\n\nProject Evaluation:\nA Few Final Thoughts\n\"Civil engineers are problem solvers, but we need to broaden the scope of our services to\ninclude problem definition. Civil engineers must go beyond thinking in terms of project specific\nlimits and scopes of work and become involved in system-wide, program-related decisions and\npolicy-making to achieve long-term, sustainable solutions.\nWe must be facilitators of\ncollaboration among multiple agencies/owners and across jurisdictional boundaries. We must\nalso take a leadership role in developing acceptable and sustainable methods of funding\ninfrastructure development and asset management.\"\nKathy J. Caldwell, ASCE News, June 2009\nSocieties and civilizations advance through projects that seek to make life safer, healthier, more prosperous or more\nsecure. History abounds with tales of famous projects, from the pyramids of Egypt and Mexico, the temples of Greece\nand Cambodia, the aqueducts and roads of Rome and the Great Wall of China to the canals, railroads and telegraphs\nof the 19th century and the highways, telecommunication, dams, and water and wastewater systems of the 20th.\nCountries have been bankrupted by bad projects, secured by practical projects, and advanced by bold projects.\nIndividual fortunes have been made or squandered on projects, as banks and financial markets have made it possible\nto direct vast sums of money toward massive undertakings anywhere in the world. Large projects entail large risks,\nand such projects will only be undertaken if those promoting the projects can convince investors or governments to\nfund them. Highly capable, charismatic individuals motivated many great projects, including the Suez Canal, the\nBrooklyn Bridge, and the Empire State Building. However, it has not always been possible to separate the true\nvisionaries from the charlatans and the deluded, especially when it comes to large outlays of public funds.\nProject evaluation could be viewed narrowly as a set of procedures and methodologies that can be used to determine\nwhether or not a proposal should be approved. Indeed, there are well-defined methods for assessing financial aspects\nof a project, and private companies and investors use these methods routinely in determining whether or not to begin\nprojects or to invest in them. Moreover, governments today mandate environmental and social impact assessment\nprior to the approval of any significant project, and they use intricate economic models to estimate the effect of public\ninfrastructure investments.\nHowever, taking such a narrow approach misses the most interesting and challenging aspects of projects and programs,\nnamely coming up with ideas for what could become a successful project. Someone has to come up with the proposals\nthat will be subjected to careful scrutiny by banks, government agencies, and the public. Such proposals could emerge\nfrom a careful consideration of what society needs, they could reflect insight into opportunities offered by new\ntechnologies, or they could simply be pipe dreams that appeal to public emotions but that have little chance of success.\nMuch of the challenge and excitement in project evaluation deals with the earliest stages of a project, in clarifying the\nneeds of society, in anticipating technological opportunities, and pulling together ideas or objectives for a possible\nproject or program. Figuring out what the problem really is, defining the problem in a way that invites diverse\nsolutions, and responding to the problems effectively and creatively can be extremely rewarding, both in terms of the\nsuccess of whatever is done and in terms of the intellectual satisfaction of those involved in the process. In these early\nstages of project evaluation, breadth of thinking, curiosity, imagination, intuition and flexibility are more important\nthan analytical capabilities or methodological excellence. This is when the story of a project begins to emerge.\nEvery project has a story, and every story has several components. What are the context and the history of the project?\nWhat are the needs that are addressed by the project? How will the proposed project meet those needs? What other\napproaches are available and why is the proposed approach the best approach? How much will it cost and who will\npay for it? What are the broader impacts on society? What is the proper role for government? Why should the public\nsupport the project? How will negative externalities be mitigated? Projects will have financial, economic, social,\n\nenvironmental and aesthetic impacts, any or all of which could be important in telling the story, in evaluating whether\nor not to proceed or how best to proceed, and in going from preliminary thoughts toward final design.\n\"The need is to subordinate economic to aesthetic goals - to sacrifice efficiency, including the\nefficiency of organizations, to beauty. Nor must there be any nonsense about beauty paying in the\nlong run. It need not pay. It is though the state that the society must assert the superior claims of\naesthetic over economic goals and particularly of environment over cost.\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith, \"Liberty, Happiness and the Economy\",\nThe Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 149, No. 5, June 1967, pp. 521-26\nGood solutions seldom come straight from a textbook, nor do they come from the use of complex techniques of\noperations research that claim to find the optimal solution to a problem. Good solutions arise from a deep\nunderstanding of the nature of the problems or needs and a clear idea of what might be done. Experts who have\ndeveloped a comprehensive conceptual framework for addressing system performance will often be able to contribute\na great deal to the early stages of project evaluation, especially with regard to the kinds of technical approaches that\nare possible. Users, abutters, and members of the public will be able to contribute their understanding of needs,\nidentify issues that are important, and - in the aggregate if not always individually - help in applying some common\nsense to the discussion. Brainstorming, systematic analysis, sensitivity analysis, and scenarios can all be useful in\neliciting ideas and in determining what approaches might work best in dealing with a problem.\nThe gestation period for very large projects may be measured in decades, and gaining approval for a major project or\nprogram may require seemingly endless political wrangling and nearly impossible coordination among local, state,\nand federal officials. Projects and programs therefore will need champions who are willing and able to fight the\nbureaucratic, political and legal battles that must be waged. The most effective leaders will incorporate social and\nenvironmental elements into the initial design and be able to use the environmental impact assessment process as a\nmeans of enhancing projects and building public support for them.\nVery few infrastructure projects relate to anything that is entirely new. Most proposed projects will be viewed as\npotential enhancements to an existing system that deals with transportation, water resources, energy, or some other\nsocietal need. Effective project evaluation therefore requires understanding of how such systems are created, how\nthey evolve to meet changing social and economic conditions, and how they eventually give way to obsolescence or\nto new technologies. Different types of projects and different kinds of issues are encountered in each stage of system\nevolution. In early stages, there will be a struggle to determine how best to use new technologies, how to structure\nfacilities or networks, and in general how to become more effective and more efficient. In later stages, there will be\na need to adjust the size and structure of the systems to adjust to new technologies or new kinds of competition. At\nthe end, the challenge may be to grow old gracefully and pass away.\nIn recent decades, changes in technology have made some of our infrastructure systems obsolete, changes in social\nnorms have made other systems inadequate, and changes in scientific knowledge have revealed unacceptable results\nfrom the systems we have built and continue to use. As result, most infrastructure systems initiated long ago are\nproving to be unsustainable, because of financial, social or environmental problems. We have become ever more\naware of the need to grapple with climate change, over-dependence upon fossil fuels, destruction of forests and\nwetlands, contamination of the oceans, congestion and pollution within our largest cities, and ensuring adequate food\nand clean water for the growing global population. To deal with these issues, we will need to manage our infrastructure\nsystems more effectively, develop new technologies, and initiate projects that enhance the sustainability of our\ncivilization. Sustainable projects and programs will be those that will have adequate financing for construction,\nmaintenance, and operations, a fair distribution of costs and benefits to society, and the ability to continue indefinitely\nwithout significant depletion of resources or disruption of the environment. Engineers, planners, conservation groups,\nbusinesses, politicians, and the general public will have to work together to figure out how best to move toward more\nsustainable infrastructure for the 21st century and beyond.\n\nFurther Reading\nI love projects, don't you?\n(Luther Billis, in South Pacific by Rogers and Hammerstein)\nMany books and articles delve into the history of infrastructure projects and systems, highlighting the personalities of\nchampions and opponents, the needs addressed by the project, the technologies used, the trials and tribulations that\nwere faced, and the ultimate achievements. This bibliography lists books and articles that I have enjoyed, and I suspect\nthat there are many more. Reading about past projects, including failures as well as successes, will provide a valuable\ncontext for anyone involved or interested in project evaluation and infrastructure systems. We can all learn from the\nsuccesses and failures of those who have gone before us. The best options are not always chosen, the long-term\nimpacts are not always considered, and the process is not always transparent, objective, or even rational. Nevertheless,\nmany great projects have been built, many bad proposals have been rejected, and many innovations have helped to\nmake infrastructure systems perform better.\nBooks about Infrastructure Projects and Programs\nAl Naib, S.K., London Docklands Past, present and future: An illustrated guide to history, heritage and regeneration.\nResearch Books, Romford, Esses RM6 5BY, Great Britain.

The subject was designed to fill a void in the education of civil engineering students,\nnamely an understanding of why major infrastructure projects are undertaken, how they are structured and evaluated,\nand how they are financed. These topics, which naturally are of central importance to civil and environmental\nengineering, are related to, but certainly not central to micro-economics, the subject that was previously required for\ncivil engineering undergrads at MIT.\n\nMicro-economics is an interesting and challenging field, but it tends to ignore or brush quickly over some of the central\nissues in designing and developing infrastructure projects. Where should a project be located? When should it be\nbuilt? Can it be developed in phases, so that capacity can be added only when and where it is needed? For engineers,\nplanners, and entrepreneurs, these are critical questions. Those who want to be engineers, planners or entrepreneurs\nmust learn how to balance current vs. future costs and benefits, and they must be able to understand and respond to\nthe many factors that influence the pace and location of development. In particular, they must understand the time\nvalue of money, the equivalence of cash flows, and the effects of risk and inflation on discount rates and the\nattractiveness of projects. These are all central topics in engineering economics, but they are largely or entirely absent\nfrom the standard introduction to micro-economics. As I tell my students, economics is a bit too close to the Twilight\nZone - \"a dimension neither of space nor time\".\n\nA second concern with micro-economics is that many of the most interesting concepts are extremely difficult to apply\nwithout making assumptions that, to an engineer or planner or entrepreneur, seem to be simplistic or heroic or merely\nuntenable. An engineer is likely to treat with suspicion any proposition that begins with \"given a cost function\" or\n\"given a production function\" or \"given supply and demand curves\". Where do these functions come from? How are\nthese curves calibrated? Some economists have gone to factories and rail yards and studied the inputs and outputs\nactually required for the various possible means of production. More commonly, economists have relied on statistical\ntechniques to calibrate functions that certainly appear to be very complex to the student (or to the reader of a journal\narticle), but that in fact are a quite simple portrayal of costs or production or demand based upon analysis of what has\nhappened in the past. For many purposes, notably many kinds of policy analysis, econometric modeling and economic\ntheory provide useful insights, but when considering major projects, engineers, planners, and entrepreneurs are more\nconcerned with what can be done in the future than with what was done in the past. New technologies, new designs,\nchanges in relative costs of inputs, and many other factors will influence what will be possible or desirable to do in\nthe future. Someone, presumably the engineers and the planners, will have to figure out what can be done and convince\nothers that it should be done, tasks that require creativity and judgment as well as an understanding of complex systems\nand methodologies.\n\nWhile I understand the argument that undergraduates should learn the basics of their field and that they should\ndiscipline their mind through thorough rigorous examination and understanding of a complex, intellectually\nstimulating subject, my personal experience suggests that students require the stimulation of real situations to truly\n\nxii\nunderstand the concepts that we try to teach them. Moreover, it is possible to over-emphasize methodologies and\ntheories while doing little to encourage independent thought and initiative. Thus, in designing my class on project\nevaluation, I included case studies, open-ended problem sets, and a term project in which the students investigated\nprojects of their own choosing. I had students complete some exercises from an engineering economics textbook, but\nI was much more interested in how well they could apply the methodologies and ideas in analyses and interpretations\nof realistic problems.\n\nAt this point I should add a short note on my background. As an undergrad I studied math, but lost interest as the\ntheory deepened and the potential applications receded. As a senior and then in graduate school, I shifted to studying\nwhat was just beginning to be called \"urban systems\", but eventually ended up writing a thesis on rail freight system\nreliability. For the next 35 years, I remained on the research staff at MIT, supervising many research projects that\nwere funded by the rail freight industry - an experience that forced me and my students to pay great attention to detail\nand to reality. In effect, we spent several decades working with rail researchers and field personnel to understand and\nimprove the cost functions and production functions related to various categories of rail freight. Over this period, the\nrail industry transformed itself from a nearly bankrupt, over-built and under-maintained system into a thriving, stream-\nlined system with more trains, longer and heavier trains, heavier loads, and more efficient equipment and facilities.\nThe industry had little to spend on research, so it went to great efforts to focus that research on areas where there\nwould be a payoff. Participating in this research proved to be an outstanding way to understand the functioning of an\nextremely complex, long-lived system as it was updating its infrastructure and equipment to serve new markets.\n\nDuring my research career, I described much of what I did as being some sort of engineering economics. Several\naspects of engineering economics were absolutely critical:\n\n-\nNet present value and equivalence of cash flows: the ability to compare cash flows over long time horizons\nfor multiple alternatives, often in an attempt to understand the potential for new technologies or operating\nstrategies.\n-\nEngineering-based cost and performance functions: the ability to structure detailed cost and performance\nfunctions that captured the relevant aspects of the technologies and operations that were of interest.\n-\nProbabilistic analysis: the ability to include probabilistic features when structuring cost and service functions.\n-\nIdentification of key factors: the use of financial analysis, scenarios, and sensitivity analysis to identify the\nmost important factors affecting a project, the use of new technology, or the choice of operating or marketing\nstrategies.\n-\nApproximation: appreciation of the fact that it is seldom necessary to obtain precise results in order to reach\nsolid conclusions.\n-\nStructuring and interpreting results: recognizing that lack of consensus regarding objectives, ambiguity\nrelated to costs and constraints, uncertainty about how systems really work, and many other factors make it\nunwise to accept the totally unwarranted level of precision that can be obtained from modern computational\ntechnologies.\n\nMy class on project evaluation was, like Caesar's Gaul, divided into main three parts. The first part provided an\noverview of project evaluation as a multi-dimensional process aimed at creating projects that meet the needs of society.\nThe second part covered discounting, net present value, financial assessment, and other basic methodologies of\nengineering economics. The third part addressed issues such as risk and uncertainty, technology scanning, public-\nprivate partnerships, and the evolution of infrastructure systems over long periods of time.\n\nOver time, the basic framework remained unchanged, but I was able to develop ever more detailed notes, additional\nassignments, more open-ended case studies, and more complete presentations for my undergraduate class on project\nevaluation. I also gave lectures on project evaluation in graduate courses at MIT in the Department Civil &\nEnvironmental Engineering, the Center for Transportation & Logistics, and the Engineering Systems Division. After\nretiring from my full-time appointment at MIT, I began to transform my lecture notes and other course materials into\na series of essays and case studies suitable for a textbook. At the request of Jenny Welter, an editor at John Wiley &\nSons, I expanded my notes by adding a great many simple examples, hundreds of problems, and new material on\n\nxiii\nproject management and engineering economics. In 2011, Wiley published Toward More Sustainable Infrastructure:\nProject Evaluation for Planners and Engineers, a 500-page textbook that covers the basic methods of project\nevaluation, provides examples attuned to infrastructure systems, and includes case studies that illustrate the breadth\nand excitement of project evaluation as related to infrastructure systems. Solutions to the problems, an instructor's\nmanual, and power point presentations for each chapter are all available from Wiley. These materials can provide\nstudents and instructors with tools and concepts that they can use in understanding or teaching the need for projects,\nthe options that are available, and the methods for evaluating and refining the options that are available.\n\nHowever, a 500-page textbook is not the ideal format for presenting the concepts of project evaluation to a broader\naudience that includes grad students interested in infrastructure systems, mid-career engineers making the transition\nto management, public officials involved with infrastructure systems or anyone else with an interest in planning for,\nmanagement of, or investment in infrastructure systems. I therefore decided to return to my class notes and\nprofessional papers in order to create a shorter, more focused book that would be readily available to anyone interested\nin infrastructure systems. Instead of a textbook with long chapters and hundreds of examples and problems, this book\nfocuses on concepts and case studies directly related to project evaluation. It assumes the reader is familiar with\nsupply & demand and other basic economic concepts; it does not cover project management; and it avoids going into\nesoteric elements of engineering economics such as equivalence relationships involving gradients or geometric\nsequences. Nevertheless, most of material in this book is very similar to what is in the textbook, because both books\ndraw upon the same notes, case studies, technical papers, and presentations that I developed while teaching my class\non project evaluation between 1997 and 2009.\n\nThe material includes two categories of documents, namely essays and case studies. Those who wish to gain a broad\nconceptual framework for understanding project evaluation in the context of infrastructure systems can read the essays;\nthose who wish more detail on methodologies in the context of specific projects can concentrate on the case studies.\nEach essay and each case study is a stand-alone document that be read without being distracted by references to\ndefinitions or methods developed in prior or subsequent chapters. Project Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies\nshould therefore be useful to practitioners and anyone with a general interest in project evaluation or infrastructure,\neven though it may be less appealing to a professor hoping to find a multitude of simple examples and a great many\nproblems for his students to solve.\n\nAlthough this book does not include sample problems and problem sets, such materials can be found under \"1.011\nProject Evaluation\" as part of MIT's Open Courseware website at www.MIT.edu or directly from:\n\nhttp://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/75001/1-011-spring-2005/contents/index.htm?sequence=5\n\nThis web site provides the syllabus, reading lists, assignments, quizzes and other class materials for several different\nversions of the class. It also includes student presentations for a half dozen major projects, each of which would be\ninteresting to a general reader of this book. The URL shown above is for the 2005 version of \"Project Evaluation\",\nwhich is the most complete version on Open Courseware for the years when I alone was responsible for this subject.\n\nStructure of Project Evaluation Essays and Case Studies\n\nProject Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies is published in two stand-along volumes. The first volume provides an\noverview of project evaluation as a multi-dimensional process aimed at creating projects that meet the needs of society.\nThe essays and case studies in this volume provide a framework for understanding and evaluating projects, taking into\naccount not only the financial and economic issues, but also social and environmental factors. The essays in this\nvolume emphasize that analysis will not necessarily determine what projects are considered, what projects are\nproposed, what projects are approved or what projects are ultimately successful. Projects may be motivated by a\nvision of a greater society, by an idea for addressing a specific local problem, by the prospects of making a profit\nwhile providing a needed service, or by simple greed. Some apparently excellent projects cannot be financed, while\nit may be easy to fund some very questionable projects. Case studies in Volume I are mostly based upon actual\ninfrastructure projects.\n\nxiv\n\nVolume II examines the equivalence relationships that can be used to compare cash flows or economic costs and\nbenefits over the life of a project. It covers the concepts and methodologies that can be used by investors, bankers,\nand entrepreneurs in deciding whether or not to finance projects, and it shows how public policy can use taxes and\nother regulations to encourage projects that have public benefits. Most of the case studies in this volume present\nhypothetical situations that illustrate how various methodologies can be used in project evaluation.\n\nCarl D.

The second half includes eleven hypothetical case studies that\nillustrate how these methods and procedures might be used. Each essay and each case study can be read as a stand-\nalone document, as there are no cross-references within them, nor is it necessary to read any essay before reading any\ncase study. Someone familiar with the methodology may prefer to read about applications in their areas of interest.\nSomeone with experience in particular kinds of applications may prefer to gain broader exposure to the methods\ndescribed in the essays.\n\nSystem Performance, the first essay introduces various measures that can be used to assess the performance of\ninfrastructure projects and to evaluate alternatives for improving performance. Inevitably, there will be many aspects\nof performance to consider and many possible impacts on society or the environment that must be minimized or\nmitigated. Financial analysis, which is concerned with the cash flows directly related to a project, will be critical, but\nso will economic analysis, which also includes the impacts of a project on the overall economy. Both financial and\neconomic impacts can be measured in monetary terms; which types of impacts are considered will depend upon who\nis doing the analysis. Owners, developers and users will largely be interested in financial matters; public agencies\nthat must approve projects are concerned with broader economic matters, such as job creation and regional prosperity.\n\nThe next four essays are concerned with engineering economics, which provides many of the methodologies that are\nneeded for financial and economic analysis, including the effects of taxes and depreciation, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nA central tenet of engineering economics is that it is possible to use a discount rate to estimate the equivalent present\nvalue of any future value. Given a discount rate, it is possible to calculate the net present value (NPV) of any stream\nof financial or economic costs and benefits that might be associated with a project.\n\nEquivalence of Cash Flows develops the basic relationships that can be used to transform an arbitrary stream of\nfinancial or economic benefits into an equivalent present value, an equivalent value at some future time, or an\nequivalent annuity. These relationships are what makes it possible to compare the financial and economic impacts of\nmultiple alternatives. The alternative with the highest net present value will also have the highest future value and\nproduce the largest equivalent annuity. Thus, from a financial or economic perspective, it makes sense to choose the\nalternative that maximizes net present value.\n\nThe equivalence relationships all depend upon the choice of a discount rate, which is far from a simple, objective task.\nChoosing a Discount Rate goes into considerable detail discussing the factors that will affect the choice of a discount\nrate, emphasizing that different actors involved in implementing, using, or investing in a project may have different\nperceptions of the project and therefore may use different discount rates when evaluating a proposal.\n\nOnce the NPV of financial or economic benefits have been calculated, it is straightforward to select the alternative\nwith the highest positive NPV. However, complications may arise if a different measure is used. Companies\ncommonly use the internal rate of return when evaluating projects. The IRR is the discount rate that makes the NPV\nequal zero. If the IRR is greater than a company's discount rate, then that is a valid project. However, if there are\nmutually exclusive projects, then a small project with a high IRR might appear to be better than a larger project with\na lower IRR that actually has a higher NPV. Financial Assessment presents methods that show how to deal with this\nissue. So long as the IRR analysis is applied properly, it will provide the correct ranking of mutually exclusive\nprojects.\n\nFigure 1: Structure of Four Essays Related to Discounting and Cash Flows\n\nPublic policy can affect the cash flows of a project in many ways. Zoning restrictions may limit what can and cannot\nbe done on a site. Regulations may determine what kinds of materials or construction techniques can be used. The\nintricacies of the tax code can be manipulated by law-makers in order to promote or hinder certain types of\ndevelopment or certain types of investments. In particular, major investment expenses usually cannot be immediately\ndeducted from taxable income; instead capital investments are depreciated over many years. Exactly how depreciation\nis treated in the tax code will determine when this expense is incurred. Since expenses affect profits, and profits result\nin income tax payments, it is necessary to consider depreciation in order to obtain a valid after-tax analysis of a project.\nRules of the Game shows how depreciation, taxation, zoning, and environmental regulation can evaluation.\n\nDealing with Risks and Uncertainties introduces methods that are commonly used in project evaluation to deal with\nrisks and uncertainties: modeling performance, probabilistic risk assessment, and performance-based technology\nassessment (PBTS). One case study uses probabilistic risk assessment to examine ways to reduce the risks associated\nwith rail-highway grade crossings. Another case study uses PBTS to examine competition between airlines and\nrailways for intercity passenger traffic.\n\nNPV of Net\nBenefits\nProjected Before-Tax\nCash Flows\nDiscount Rate\nProjected After-Tax\nCash Flows\nTax Code\nCost of Capital\nPerceived Risks\nEquivalent Future\nBenefits\nEquivalent\nAnnuities\nSelect the project with the highest\nNPV, FV, and Annuity Value\nChapter 10\nChapter 8\nChapter 9\nChapter 7\nEssay:\nRules of the Game\nEssay:\nChoosing a Discount Rate\nEssay:\nFinancial Assessment\nEssay: Equivalence of\nCash Flows\n\nSystem Performance\nAs it is always easier and in the end less costly to be accurate than inaccurate, the good engineer will\nalways be accurate in all essentials, but he will not waste time in attempting unnecessary precision\nwhich does not add appreciably to the final value of his work.\n\nArthur M. Wellington, The Economic Location of Railways, John Wiley & Sons, 1911\n\nPerformance of Infrastructure-Based Systems\n\nThe performance of an infrastructure system cannot be captured by just one or two measures. Cost, quality of service,\ncapacity, safety, environmental impacts and sustainability are all important, while the extent of coverage, accessibility,\nequity, and appearance can also be critical. Moreover, performance depends upon one's perspective, as owners and\nmanagers seek financial rewards, users seek good service at reasonable prices, and the public worries about such things\nas the need for subsidies, environmental impacts, safety, land use, economic development, and aesthetics (Figure 1).\nDesigning, constructing, and managing these systems involves trade-offs among multiple factors, often with no\nobvious way of determining which factors are most important. Evaluating proposals for creating new systems or for\nexpanding or modifying existing systems will always require judgment and will often require some sort of political\nprocess to determine which aspects of performance should be emphasized.\n\nSystem performance can be documented, studied, modeled, predicted and managed. If system performance is well\nunderstood, and if there is a consensus about the relative importance of the various aspects of performance, then it is\npossible to provide a clear, objective basis for evaluating new projects and programs. If performance is poorly\nunderstood, then research and analysis may be able to clarify the potential trade-offs for various options. If there is\nno consensus as to which aspects of performance are most important, then research and analysis of performance can\nat least provide an objective framework for evaluating proposals.\n\nFigure 1 Perspectives on Infrastructure Performance\n\nInfrastructure\nPerformance\nOwners and\nManagers\nSystem\nOperating Cost\nUsage Volume\nInvestment\nRequirements\nMaintenance\nRequirements\nRisks Associated\nwith Construction\nand Operation\nUsers\nService Quality\nAccessibility and\nAvailability\nPrice\nOther Costs of\nUsing the System\nRisks Associated\nwith Using the\nSystem\nThe Public\nEnvironmental\nImpacts\nRisks to Abutters\nand the General\nPublic\nSubsidies and\nOther Costs\nAesthetics and\nLand Use\nOther Social\nImpacts\n\nPerformance of infrastructure systems depends upon engineering and managerial issues, such as the nature, condition,\nand deterioration rates of structures and equipment. Infrastructure managers develop plans and policies that they use\nto guide operations and maintenance, usually with the hope of increasing profitability or other financial goals. The\nmanagement structure will often have separate departments responsible for operations, maintenance and marketing,\neach of which will have their own concerns and ideas about what types of projects will be most beneficial in improving\nperformance. Each department's objectives will ideally reflect strategic plans, which may include financial goals,\ngoals for expanding or shrinking the system, plans for new services or markets, or goals related to service quality, risk\nmanagement or interactions with the public (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2 Managing Infrastructure\nManaging Infrastructure\nOperating Policy\nLimits on Users\nUsage Volume\nOperating Capacity\nHours of Operation\n(Availability of Service)\nSafety Plans\nMaintenance Policy\nDisruptions to Service\nLimitations on Use\nInspections\nDesired Condition\nManaging Risks with\nSystem Conditions\nMarketing Policy\nAdvertising & Sales\nExpansion Opportunities\nPricing\nPriority Market Segments\nStrategic Planning\n\nPerformance also depends upon many other factors, including the regulatory structure, operating capabilities, and\nbusiness strategies pursued by the organizations and individuals that make use of the infrastructure and the existence\nand performance of competing infrastructure systems.\n\nMost importantly, perhaps, performance reflects the demand for the service, especially when usage approaches system\ncapacity. A highway that allows motorists to drive through the city at high speeds in the middle of the night can be\nmore like a parking lot during rush hour. It is a very complex matter to predict the average speed on a highway during\nrush hour, for that will require some way to estimate demand taking into account the fact that the level of demand will\naffect performance. It is more straightforward to develop a performance function for the highway, i.e. to predict\nthe performance of the highway for any particular level of demand.\n\nPerformance functions can be developed for any infrastructure system based upon the engineering characteristics of\nthe infrastructure and the ways that it is used. Developing engineering-based performance functions enables\nplanners and entrepreneurs to understand the options for developing or improving systems, to evaluate the impact of\nproposed projects, to understand the potential benefits of new technologies, and to select and design better projects.\nPerformance functions may or may not be precise, depending upon the state of knowledge of the system and also upon\nthe context for their use. The remaining sections of this essay focus on performance measures important for all\ninfrastructure systems: cost, profitability, service, capacity, safety, and security.\n\nSystem Cost\n\nOwners and investors are concerned with the initial cost to construct infrastructure, as well as the continuing cost for\noperating and maintaining the infrastructure. Users are concerned with their costs of using the system, which would\ninclude the prices they are charged plus their own time and expense associated with using the system. Basic cost\nconcepts include the following:\n\n-\nTotal cost: what is the total cost of the system for a given level of output?\n-\nAverage cost: what is the average cost per unit of output?\n-\nMarginal cost: what is the cost for one additional unit of output?\n\n-\nIncremental cost: what is the cost for an increment of output?\n\nThese concepts can be illustrated using an extremely simple equation expressing cost as a linear function of volume\nV:\n\n(Eq. 1)\nCost = a + b V\n(Eq. 2)\nAverage cost = (a + b V)/V = a/V + b\n(Eq. 3)\nMarginal cost = (a + b (V + 1)) - (a + b V) = b\nThe fixed cost \"a\" is incurred whatever the volume, and \"b\" is the marginal cost per additional unit. The average cost\nper unit declines as the fixed cost is spread over additional volume. In any particular situation, these cost functions\nwill be much more complex. Total cost will be a function of the resources that are used and their unit costs, and the\nresources that are used will depend upon the quality of service as well as the level of demand.\n\nThe fixed cost could well be the sum of many different types of costs that would not vary with changes in volume,\nsuch as the salaries of the senior administrative staff, the costs of establishing a maintenance facility, and the costs of\nacquiring basic equipment and machinery. Variable costs would likely include the labor and energy costs associated\nwith operations. Which costs are fixed and which costs are variable depends upon the level of volume and the time\nframe under consideration. In the short run, many more costs are fixed, while in the long run, most costs can be\naffected by restructuring the system. Whatever the time frame, the simple cost function shown above as Equation 1\nmay (for a reasonable and meaningful range of volumes) actually be a useful approximation of a much more complex\ncost function. Hence, it is worth taking a closer look at this cost function.\n\nConsider a situation in which following cost function is believed to be approximately valid for volumes V ranging\nfrom 10 to 100 units per day:\n\n(Eq. 4)\nTotal Cost = $50 + $1 (V)\nThe fixed cost is $50, which plots as a straight horizontal line in Figure 3, while the variable cost plots as a straight\nline with a slope of 1. If this line were extended beyond the range of interest, it would intersect at the origin of the\ngraph.\n\nFigure 3 Plotting fixed, variable and total cost if C = 50 + V\n\nFigure 4 shows the average and variable cost for this cost function. The marginal cost is equal to $1 over the entire\nrange, while the average cost declines from $6 when volume is 10 units per day to $1.50 when demand is 100 units\nper day. The average cost function is non-linear, and the average cost approaches the marginal cost for high volumes.\n\nVolume\nCost\nFixed Cost\nVariable Cost\nTotal Cost\n\nFigure 4 Plotting average and marginal cost if C = 50 + V\n\nIt is very common to find that there is a trade-off among two options, one of which has higher fixed cost but lower\nmarginal cost. Figure 5 shows a second cost curve in which the fixed cost has increased from $50 to $95 per day, but\nthe variable cost has dropped from $1 to $0.50. The breakeven point is at 90 units per day: above this level, option 2\nis preferred, while below this level option 1 is preferred.\n\nFigure 5 The option with the higher fixed cost is preferred if the volume is greater than 90\n(Cost of Option 1 = 50 + V; Cost of Option 2 = 95 + V/2)\n\nFor linear functions of the type TC = a + bV, the breakeven point Vb can readily be calculated:\n\nIf\n\nTC1 = a1 + b1V\nand\n\nTC2 = a2 + b2V\nthen, at the point where the costs are equal for the two technologies, the following equation will hold:\n\n(Eq. 5)\na1 + b1Vb = a2 + b2Vb\nSolving for Vb yields:\n(Eq. 6)\nVb = (a2 - a1)/(b1 - b2)\nIn words, the breakeven volume is calculated as the increase in fixed cost divided by the savings in variable cost per\nunit. Major CEE projects require investments that are aimed at reducing marginal cost. Larger projects typically\nprovide an opportunity for greater reductions in marginal cost. A key question is whether there will be enough demand\nVolume\nCost\nAverage Cost\nMarginal Cost\n90 100 110 120 130 140 150\nVolume\nCost\nTotal Cost Option 1\nTotal Cost Option 2\n\nto cover the extra costs associated with the larger project. In general, smaller projects will be better until congestion\nand capacity concerns make a larger project desirable.\n\nL.F. Loree, Past-President of the Delaware & Hudson Railway and Chair of the Kansas City\nSouthern, described how railroads worked hard to avoid investing unnecessarily in capacity:\n\nWe hang back and postpone as long as possible work to increase facilities the use of\nwhich may be increased by ingenuity and method.\n\nL.F. Loree, Railroad Freight Transportation,\nD. Appleton & Co., 1922, p. 61\n\nNon-linear Cost Functions\nLinear cost functions are easy to draw, but more complex functions will often be necessary. The same logic applies\nto plotting total costs, average cost, or marginal costs and the same approach can be used to determine breakeven\nvolumes. Figure 6 illustrates a situation where three technological options are available, each of which can be\nrepresented by a non-linear cost function:\n\n(Eq. 7)\nTotal Cost Option 1 = 50 + V + 0.03V2\n(Eq. 8)\nTotal Cost Option 2 = 100 + 0.5V + 0.02V2\n(Eq. 9)\nTotal Cost Option 3 = 300 + 0.25V + 0.01V2\nThe third term in these equations means that the average costs eventually begin to increase, as the contribution of the\nsquared term eventually offsets the savings from spreading the fixed costs over a larger volume. Figure 6 plots the\naverage costs of the three technologies for the ranges of volumes for which they are feasible options. Option 1, the\none with the lowest initial cost, has average costs greater than $6/unit for the minimum volume of 10 units; average\ncosts drop below $4/unit for volumes of 30 to 50 units, then rise steadily as volume increases to 100 units, which is\nthe maximum that can be handled by this technology. Option 3 is much too expensive for or ill-suited to low volumes,\nso the costs for that technology are only shown for volumes of at least 40 units. Figure 6 indicates that Option 1 is\nfavored for volumes less than about 50, while Option 2 is cheapest for volumes between 50 and 130 and Option 3 is\nfavored for greater volumes.\n\nFigure 6 Long-Run Average Costs\n\n90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160\nVolume\nAverage Cost\nAverage Cost Option 1\nAverage Cost Option 2\nAverage Cost Option 3\n\nShort-Run vs. Long-Run Average Costs\nThe three cost curves shown above in Figure 6 each depict short-run average costs for a particular technology. Each\ncurve shows the average costs that would result from using a particular technology for a specified range of volumes.\nThey are called \"short-run\" average costs because they do not allow a shift to a more efficient technology.\n\nIt is often useful to understand how average cost of a particular type of process or production would change with\nvolume, assuming that the best technology is used for each level of volume. This cost is called the long-run average\ncost, assuming that in the long-run it will be possible to adjust the production process to what is best for the actual\nvolume served or produced. The long-run average cost curve can be constructed from the applicable short-run cost\ncurves: for each volume, the long-run average cost is equal to the short-run cost of the technological option with the\nlowest short-run average cost. In other words, the long-run average cost will be the envelope of the minimum short-\nrun costs, as depicted in Figure 7. This is a single cost function that is based upon the three cost functions shown in\nthe previous figure. The long-run average cost in Figure 7 could be described as a little less than $4 for volumes\nranging from 20 to 160.\n\nFigure 7 Long-Run Average Costs for Technologies Shown in Figure 2-6\n\nYou (the developer, entrepreneur, or planner) know, or should know, your costs and technologies. You therefore\nshould be able to develop an algebraic expression for your costs that accounts for the technological and design options\nthat you may have. It the developer, entrepreneur, or planner doesn't know their costs or technologies, then you (the\nconsultant, the researcher, or the smart young analyst) may be able to do some analysis and create relevant cost\nfunctions.\n\nResource Requirements\nCosts ultimately are linked to resources: people, land, materials, energy, and capital. There will always be many\ndifferent ways to use resources in constructing a particular project, and choices will probably be made by developers,\nengineers and planners seeking to minimize the cost of the project. From their perspective, minimizing cost is purely\na financial exercise aimed at minimizing the cash required to complete the project.\n\n90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160\nVolume\nLong-Run Average Cost\nOption 1\nOption 2\nOption 3\nThere is more than one way to skin a cat.\n\nAmerican Proverb\n\nThe design of a project and the resources required for it will be influenced by both the current and the expected future\navailability and prices of people, land, materials, energy sources, and capital. If average salaries and wages are\nexpected to rise relative to the cost of capital, then there will be a tendency to use fewer people and more machines.\nIf the cost of energy is expected to rise relative to the cost of building materials, then there will be an incentive to\nconstruct buildings that require less energy and to use materials that are less energy intensive. If longer lasting\nmaterials are created, they will be used where their longevity provides benefits to a project. Standard methodologies\nof engineering economics make it possible to decide what system design is best for a project, which materials to use,\nand which construction techniques to follow, taking into account the initial investment cost and costs to the owners\nand users over the life of the project.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, however, the price of a resource may not reflect the true economic cost of using that\nresource:\n\n-\nThe cost of using a resource is an opportunity cost; the use of resources on one project means that they are\nnot being used on other projects or being reserved for future use.\n-\nThere may be negative environmental impacts associated with using a resource, such as the paving over of\nwetlands, emission of greenhouse gases in the manufacture of construction materials or the devastation of\nremote wild areas by mining activities.\n-\nNon-sustainable use of renewable resources, such as ground water or timber, will lead to declines in the\namount of such resources that can be used in the future.\n-\nExtensive use of non-renewable resources can eventually lead to resource depletion.\n-\nExposure of workers to unsafe conditions or hazardous environments may lead to risks of injury or serious\nillness; unscrupulous companies may be able to avoid covering the costs associated with these problems, and\ngovernments may or may not regulate workplace conditions.\n-\nThere may be government subsidies for certain types of workers or government regulations that require the\nuse of excessive numbers of workers.\n\nSome of these costs may be reflected in the market prices for certain resources, such as the cost of capital and salaries\nand wages in developed countries. Other costs are notably absent from the prices that are charged, such as the effects\nof emissions on global warming or the environmental damages related to strip mining. If a company or a country\nalready owns land that could be used for a project, they may not even consider the cost of using that land in the\nanalysis, even though developing that land may forestall even better opportunities in the future.\n\nIf the prices for resources actually approximate the costs associated with using those resources, then financial analysis\nwill perhaps produce a reasonable result. If the prices for some resources are markedly above or below their full\neconomic costs, then the financial analysis could result in poor decisions from the perspective of society, even when\nthose decisions do appear to increase the profitability of the project. Because of the discrepancy between financial\nand economic costs, public policy must enforce rules and regulations that promote or enforce consideration of the true\neconomic costs of a project. Such regulations include:\n\n-\nRestrictions on development of wetlands and other sensitive environments\n-\nRegulations related to occupational safety and health\n-\nMinimum wages and laws allowing the formation of unions\n-\nLicensing of engineers and others involved in project design and implementation\n-\nRegulations concerning the technologies and methods used in mining and other extractive activities\n-\nRegulations requiring assessment of environmental and social impacts\n\nFor most privately sponsored projects in developed countries, project evaluation will be strictly based upon a financial\nanalysis. If government regulations are effective, then the private decisions will be reasonably good. If government\nregulations fail to capture significant aspects of economic costs - as has been the case with many environmental\nimpacts - then private decisions could lead to increasing problems for society.\n\nWhen evaluating projects, or when estimating costs, it will always be worthwhile a) to detail the actual resources that\nwill be used in addition to how much money is needed and b) to document the methodologies and logic used in\nreaching decisions about design, choice of materials, and choice of construction methods. As prices of resources\nchange relative to each other, as new technologies become available, and as more economic aspects of costs are\nrecognized, different types of projects and different approaches to constructing those project will be needed. However,\nthe original methodologies and logic may still be suitable for evaluating future projects.\n\nSince many engineers and planners work in places with markedly different levels of development, it is important to\nrecognize that the best solutions in one country can be quite different from the best solutions in another country. This\nis especially true when comparing systems in a developed country with systems in a developing country, where labor\ncosts are apt to be much lower and capital costs much higher.\n\nLifecycle Cost\n\nSince infrastructure lasts a long time, infrastructure design should consider costs over the entire life of the\ninfrastructure. As shown in Figure 8, initial costs of design are likely to be modest compared to the construction costs\nthat follow. Once the project is completed, there will costs of operation that may be borne by the owner, users or\nabutters. As the facility ages, it may be desirable to expand or to rehabilitate the facilities. Eventually, as a result of\ndeclining demand or excessive costs of maintenance, it will be necessary to decommission the facilities and to salvage\nmetal or whatever is left of value. Notice that the original owner and developer incur the initial costs, while users\nand abutters and subsequent owners are left with whatever the long-term costs turn out to be.\n\nFigure 8 Life Cycle Costs for Infrastructure\nLifecycle Cost - A Key\nConcept for CEE Project\nDesign\nConstruct\nExpand\nOperate\nDecommission\nSalvage\nTime\n-10\nAnnual Expense\nOwner and\ndeveloper\nOwner, users, and\nabutters\nOwner and\nabutters\n1. Cost Terminology\n\nThe design phase offers the greatest opportunity to affect the life cycle costs of a project (Figure 9). At this point,\nwhile all things will not be possible, many things will be. A major design consideration will be the extent to which\nthe owner or developer considers the costs to users and abutters. Small changes in design conceivably produce more\nefficient operations or limit the negative effects on third parties, but only to the extent to which such costs are even\nconsidered in the design. Mistakes regarding the size of the project - too big, too small, too soon, too little flexibility,\ntoo difficult to rehabilitate, too much impact on neighbors - conceivably can be rectified with little or no additional\ntime or expense related to construction. The opportunities for savings will be clearest when the owner will be\nresponsible for operations for the indefinite future; the opportunities for misguided design (or fraud) will be greatest\nwhen the developer is interested only in minimizing the construction cost, as operations and maintenance will be the\nresponsibility of others.\n\nFigure 9 Opportunities for Reducing Cost Are Greatest at the Outset\nLifecycle Cost - Greatest Potential For\nLifecycle Savings is in Design!\nDesign\nConstruct\nExpand\nOperate\nDecommission\nSalvage\nTime\n-10\nAnnual Expense\nEasy to modify\ndesign and\nmaterials\nLimited ability to\nmodify infrastructure\nor operation\nFew options -\ncost already\nincurred\nStill possible to make some\nmodifications in design or\nmaterials\n1. Cost Terminology\n\nEngineering-Based Cost Functions\nThree approaches can be used to estimate cost functions: accounting, econometric, and engineering-based. Each\napproach has its usefulness, but for project evaluation, an engineering-based approach is essential.\n\nAccounting approach: for an existing system, whether an apartment building, a transportation terminal or a wind\nfarm, it should be possible to identify all of the expenses related to the system's construction and operation. If the\naccounting system is accurate and complete, then the costs associated with each phase of the design, construction and\noperation of the project should be evident. Complications will arise if there are many different owners and users or if\nit is difficult to allocate specific costs to specific purposes or users. Special studies may be required to support a\nrealistic allocation of costs or to identify user costs. However, the companies or agencies that manage infrastructure\nare likely to have very good information concerning their own costs and good estimates of the costs borne by their\nusers.\n\nThere are two main problems with using accounting costs for project evaluation. First, accounting costs will not\nreadily relate to the costs of new projects, unless the new projects are very similar to existing projects. Second,\naccounting systems can provide very rich detail concerning existing operations, but they will not show how costs vary\nwith demand, quality of service, capacity or technology.\n\nEconometric approach: if cost data are available for a variety of completed projects, it may be possible to discern\ntrends in cost as a function of the type or size or location of the project. Econometric analysis can be useful for public\npolicy. For example, if data were available on the cost of constructing apartment buildings in a major city, it would\nbe possible to determine the cost per apartment or the cost/square foot of living space for each project. This data could\nthen be plotted to determine if the cost/apartment and the cost/square foot vary with the size of the project. If large\nprojects involving a hundred or more apartments are markedly cheaper to construct than small projects, then public\npolicy perhaps should be slanted toward facilitating larger projects.\n\nAlthough the econometric approach can be very useful in determining some basic trends in cost, it is less useful in\nestimating costs for a particular project. It is very ill-suited toward estimating the costs of projects that use new designs\nor technologies - and these of course are among the characteristics of many large-scale infrastructure projects.\n\nEngineering-based approach: the preferred method for estimating infrastructure costs is to break a project into well-\ndefined pieces for which it is feasible to estimate unit costs. For each piece of the project, unit costs can be developed\nbased upon past experience, expert judgment, or special studies. These unit costs can reflect new technologies or new\ndesigns, so that this approach is not restricted to past experience.\n\nProfitability, Breakeven Volume, and Return on Investment\n\nProfit\n\nEntrepreneurs and owners will be concerned with the financial success of a project. There are three main questions\nthat will be of interest. First, will the project be profitable? Second, will the profit be sufficient to justify the\ninvestment that is required? Third, once the project is completed, will it be worth more than it cost to build it? The\nproject will be profitable if the revenues received from the project are sufficient to cover its costs. The revenue could\ninclude subsidies from government agencies as well as revenues from users of the project. Revenue from users will\ndepend upon the price that is charged and the value of the project to potential users. For projects that add capacity\nwithin a competitive market, such as most real estate projects, the prices that can be charged will rise and fall with\nmarket forces. For projects where competition is difficult, such as new bridges or toll roads, the prices can to some\nextent be established by the owner. In the competitive situation, the question is whether the project can be constructed\nand operated so that it is possible to achieve a profit given expected market prices. In a monopolistic situation, the\nquestion is to choose the prices that will maximize profits, assuming that there is in fact a range of prices that could\nbe profitable.\n\nLet's begin with the simple situation we discussed in the previous section:\n\n(Eq. 10)\nTotal cost = a + bV\n\nIf this is a project that will add capacity to a competitive market, then the price P will be determined by the market\nand the total revenue can be expressed as:\n\n(Eq. 11)\nRevenue = PV\n\nProfit will be the difference between revenue and cost:\n\n(Eq. 12))\n\nProfit = PV - (a + bV)\n\nBreakeven Volume\n\nIf a company has a linear cost function of the type shown above in Figures 1 and 2, then it must sell enough units so\nthat the average cost of production is less than the average sale price. If the sale price is less than the variable cost,\nthen the company will never make a profit. If the sale price is higher than the variable cost, then the company will\nreceive enough cash from the sale to cover the variable cost and have something left over that could go toward covering\nfixed costs; once sales volume is sufficient to cover fixed costs, then each sale will add to profit. The difference\nbetween the sale price and variable cost is called the contribution to fixed costs or profit or the contribution to\noverhead or profit:\n\nIf\n\nCost = a + bV\n\nand\n\nPrice = P\n\nThen\n\n(Eq. 13)\nContribution = P - b\n\n(Eq. 14)\nProfit = PV - (a + bV) = (P-b)V - a\n\nSales will be enough to generate a profit if the total contribution is enough to cover the fixed costs. The point at which\ncontribution equals fixed cost is known as the breakeven volume Vp relative to making a profit:\n\n(Eq. 15)\n\nVp = a/(P - b)\n\nThere are two conditions for profitable operation in this simple situation: price must be above variable cost and the\nvolume must be above the breakeven volume. Vp is the volume where the incremental contribution to profit from\neach unit produced is sufficient to cover its share of the fixed cost.\n\nVolume Varies with Price - the Demand Curve\n\nMore generally, usage volume will vary with the price that is charged. The higher the price, the lower the volume.\nThis is traditionally represented as a demand function, as shown in Figure 10. Note that price, presumably the\nindependent variable, is shown on the y-axis while volume, presumably the dependent variable, is shown on the x-\naxis. Faced with a downward sloping demand function, someone trying to decide upon a price for their services is\nfaced with a dilemma. Set the price too high and no one will show up; set the price too low and there won't be any\nprofit, no matter how high the volume. The expression for profitability will be the same as shown above (Eq. 14), and\nit will still be necessary for price to exceed variable cost to make a profit.\n\nFigure 10 A Typical Demand Curve\nIn General, Volume Varies With Price:\nThe lower the price, the higher the volume\nVolume\nPrice\n3. Cost, Revenue and Profitability\n\nThe best price - at least from the owner's purely financial perspective - will be the price that maximizes profit. Figure\n11 plots profit as a function of volume, where the price is defined by the demand curve shown above. The first point\non each curve corresponds to a price of $225 per unit and a volume of 1 unit per day. The third point corresponds to\na price of $140 and revenue of $420 for sales of 3 units per day; this is the price that maximizes profit. If price is\nfurther lowered to $110, the volume increases to 4 units per day and revenue rises to $440 per day, but profit declines.\nWith further price reductions, the total revenue declines. When price drops to $15, the volume is much higher, but\ntotal revenue equals total cost. For even lower prices, the owner loses money. The project therefore would be\nprofitable for any price between $15 and $225/unit. Note that the owner would rationally choose to keep prices high,\neven if there were additional benefits to society to be gained by attracting more users.\n\nThere will not necessarily be any price at which the owner could make a profit, as illustrated by Figure 12. If total\ncost always exceeds total revenue, then private companies will not provide the service. If the service is deemed to be\ndesirable for society, then the public may decide either to provide the service via a public agency (e.g. public transit)\nor to subsidize the service so that the private sector will continue in the business (e.g. subsidized housing for low-\nincome families).\n\nFigure 11 Maximizing profit is not the same as maximizing revenue.\nAs prices fall, volumes rise, but total revenue eventually drops below total cost.\nVolume (Demand) for the Giv en Price\n$\nRevenue\nCost\nMaximizing Profit is not the Same as\nMaximizing Revenue\nMax Profit\nMax Revenue\n3. Cost, Revenue and Profitability\n\nPrices people are willing to pay for use of infrastructure, for renting space in an office building, or for any other service\nor product will depend upon many factors out of control of the company or agency that is trying to make a profit.\nGeneral economic conditions and the overall supply of office space sometimes lead to dramatic changes in building\noccupancy and rental rates.\n\nFigure 12 If costs are too high, then there may be no\nprice for which a profit can be achieved\nIf costs are very high, then a company will be unable\nto make a profit for any range of prices\nCost\nRevenue\nVolume (Demand) for the Given Price\n$\nRevenue\nCost\nTotal cost always\nexceeds total revenue\n3. Cost, Revenue and Profitability\n\nReturn on Investment\n\nThe financial success of a project is often measured by the return on investment, which is the annual profit divided by\nthe initial investment in a project. If someone invests $100,000 in a project that provides a profit of $15,000 per year,\nthen the return on investment is $15,000/ $100,000 or 15%. Usually the return on the investment will vary from year\nto year, because prices and usage volume will vary with the economy, competitive conditions, and other factors that\nwill affect supply and demand. If return on investment is high, then investors will consider additional investments in\nsimilar projects; if returns are low or negative, then investors will turn to other types of projects, leave their money in\nthe bank, or perhaps invest in other companies by buying their stocks and bonds.\n\nService\n\nPotential customers for a project will be concerned about the quality of service as well as the cost. Moreover, there\nmay be many different aspects of service quality that could be important to certain customers. For example, average\ntrip time, trip time reliability, the probability of excessive delays, comfort, and convenience can all be important for\npassenger transportation systems. The relative importance of these measures will vary with the type of trip, the type\nof traveler, and the travel options that are available. For the movement of freight, key measures include the size of\nthe shipment that can be carried and the probability that the shipment will be lost or damaged in addition to trip times\nand reliability. During the nineteenth century, the introduction of railroads revolutionized inter-city travel as it was\nso much faster than walking, riding a horse, or going down a canal in a barge. During the 20th century, the introduction\nof automobiles and air travel drastically reduced the role of railroads and led to massive investments in infrastructure\nfor highways and airports. During the 21st century, high oil prices, congestion, and concerns about emissions may\nresult in another major realignment of transportation systems and investments in transportation infrastructure.\n\nWater resource systems have different measures of service quality. In developed countries, the main concern is likely\nto be the price, quality and reliability of the water supply. Potable water will be needed for every household, and\nsufficient quantities of water will need to be provided for all uses and all users at a reasonable price. In many regions\nof the world, where running water is a luxury, other measures will be useful, such as the percentage of homes with\nrunning water, the average distance to the nearest clean water in rural villages, and the probability of disruptions in\nsupply. In some regions, the chemical content of the water is a major concern for public health. For example, arsenic\nhas been found in rural water supplies in Nepal, resulting in serious health problems in many villages.\n\nHistorically, failure to keep drinking water separate from waste water and sewage resulted in outbreaks of cholera and\nother diseases that periodically would kill tens of thousands of people in major cities. Contamination of drinking\nwater remains a critical problem today in situations where earthquakes or tsunamis endanger water supplies and in\nregions where wars or rumors of war cause thousands of people to move to refugee camps with inadequate\ninfrastructure for either water or sewage.\n\nNavigation, flood control and the use of water power to generate electricity are other matters that relate to the\nconstruction of dams and levees. Riverbanks and lakeshores are wonderful locations for parks - but also prime spots\nfor industrial uses. The conflict between the natural and the manmade environment is very apparent as wetlands are\nfilled in, whether to provide additional space for ports, seaside housing, or industrial uses. In many rural areas, vast\nexpanses of wetlands have been drained (via extensive networks of drainage pipes, ditches, and channels) in order to\nprovide fertile lands for agriculture.\n\nStill other types of measures will be needed when considering energy projects. For example, the use of electricity is\npervasive throughout the developed world. Normally, customers simply have access to electricity simply by flipping\na switch, and their concerns about service relate to the time that the electric company requires to respond to infrequent\noutages caused by bad weather. Difficulties in finding an electrician to install a new appliance or disputes with the\npower company about billing are likely to cause more concerns than the availability of power. In the rest of the world,\nthe availability of electricity can be a dominant concern, as many regions have either no access to the power grid or\naccess that is limited by time of day or day of week because of limitations in capacity. Poorly maintained systems\nmay have very frequent outages, and some systems are prone to disruption related to civil unrest.\n\nAccess to energy, limitations on the use of energy, likelihood of planned and unplanned disruptions, and the time\nrequired to restore service will be aspects of service related to other types of energy used directly by consumers,\nincluding gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, firewood.\n\nEnergy companies have options in terms of the kind of energy resources that they use and the origins of those\nresources. From their perspective, a critical measure of service quality is the reliability of the supply chain, which is\nthe process by which coal, oil or other energy resource is mined, processed, and transported to their facility. In order\nto meet their customers' needs, energy companies prefer reliable supply chains for their fuel. If the supply chains are\n\nunreliable, companies have several options. They could maintain large inventories of fuel that will enable them to\ncontinue operations despite periodic breaks in deliveries, they could have multiple sources of fuel, or they could have\nredundant networks for providing their services, so that failure in one portion of the system does not shut down the\nentire system.\n\nEngineering-Based Service Functions\n\nAs was the case with cost, engineering-based functions can be developed for each aspect of service. However, service\nis more complex than cost, because it is not possible to have a single measure (such as \"dollars\") that is readily\naccepted by owners and users and everyone else as a valid measure of performance. Thus there is a multi-step process\nin developing service functions. First, and probably most important, it is important to understand what aspects of\nservice are most important to potential customers. Second, it is necessary to understand how design relates to the\nquality of service that can be offered.\n\nCapacity\n\nCapacity is another important aspect of the performance of infrastructure-based systems. Measurement of capacity is\ncomplicated by a number of factors, not the least of which is the difficulty in defining output. Infrastructure-based\nsystems typically consist of networks of facilities that are managed or used by multiple organizations using labor,\nequipment, energy, and other resources to provide what may be a rather large array of multi-dimensioned services.\nTo understand capacity, it is best to start with a small piece of the system, where it is possible to enumerate all of the\nkey inputs, where volume is well-defined, and where it is straightforward to estimate what happens to performance as\nvolume increases. As with both cost and service, it is very useful to develop engineering-based functions that relate\ncapacity to the characteristics of the infrastructure and its users.\n\nIt is often useful to consider three types of capacity:\n\n-\nMaximum capacity - the maximum flow through the system when everything is operating properly\n-\nOperating capacity - the average flow through the system under normal operating conditions\n-\nSustainable capacity - the maximum flow through the system that allows sufficient time for maintenance\nand recovery from accidents or other incidents\n\nSince demand may vary substantially on a daily, weekly or seasonal basis, it is also important to consider how well\nthe system performs during periods of peak demand. There could well be delays to users or denials of service during\npeak periods, but the system may be able to recover soon after peak demands subside. Delays during peak periods do\nnot mean that capacity has been reached; it is only when delays become serious impediments to users that capacity\nhas been reached. The solution to peak period problems could be expansions to the infrastructure, changes in\noperations, changes in pricing, or other attempts to limit peak period demands.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nSafety and security are important aspects of performance for infrastructure systems. Both refer to the likelihood of\ninjuries or fatalities to employees, customers, abutters, and others along with the probability of damages to the\ninfrastructure or to the property of users or abutters. Security generally refers to the measures that might be taken to\nprevent deliberate attacks on people or property, whether those attacks involve pickpockets, thieves, or terrorists.\nSafety is generally used in reference to accidents or problems that occur in the course of normal operations of the\nsystem, although it may also be used with respect to the possibility of deliberate attacks. Safety records for a\ntransportation company show such things as the number of accidents, the number of fatalities, and the number of\nfatalities per million miles traveled.\n\nRisk is a broader concept that can be used to describe the potential for future accidents or incidents.1 A methodology\nknown as \"probabilistic risk assessment\" can be used to measure risk in a way that is very useful in evaluating system\nperformance. Risk is the product of two factors:\n\n-\nThe probability of an accident or incident\n-\nThe expected consequences if an accident or incident occurs\n\nConsequences could include fatalities, injuries, disruption of service, release of toxic chemicals, or inconvenience to\npeople living in or moving through the neighborhood of the accident. A weighting scheme will be needed to compare\nthe severity of the different types of accidents. Strategies for reducing risks could focus either on reducing the\nprobability of accidents or on reducing the expected consequences if there is an accident.\n\nThe design of infrastructure systems always involves consideration of risks, including risks to those involved in\nconstruction of the facility as well as risks to users. Construction standards and choice of materials will depend in\npart upon the potential for natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes, and the need to provide a safe operating\nenvironment. It is never possible to eliminate all risks, and judgment will be necessary to determine which risks are\nworth worrying about.\n\nSome adjustments in predicted risks may be necessary to reflect the perceived importance of certain types of accidents\nor consequences to various stakeholders. Quantifying perceived risks requires answers to questions such as \"Who is\nat fault?\", \"Is it a catastrophic accident?\", and \"Is new technology involved\". Public perceptions of risk will be greater\nfor situations where that risk could result in catastrophic accidents with hundreds of fatalities or accidents with dreadful\nconsequences, as could be the case with the release of toxic chemicals or radiation after an accident at a chemical\nfactory or at a nuclear power plant. The public is more concerned with unknown risks that might be associated with\nnew technologies such as drones or driverless cars than with well-known risks. People know that automobile accidents\nkill tens of thousands of people per year, but they still drive cars. Fears of accidents involving nuclear power plants\nhampered development of such projects in many countries, despite an excellent safety record.\n\nA general approach to investigating the risks related to infrastructure encompasses the following basic concepts:\n\n-\nRisk reflects both the probability of an accident and the consequences of the accident.\n-\nPast experience can be a guide for estimating accident probabilities and expected consequences.\n-\nWeights can be devised for comparing different types of consequences.\n-\nStrategies for reducing risks can be evaluated by comparing the costs of those strategies to the expected\nreduction in risk.\n\nCompanies, operating agencies and agencies that create, use or regulate infrastructure are continually seeking cost-\neffective ways to reduce risks. Since resources are limited and risks can never be entirely eliminated, it is important\nto allocate those resources effectively. In practice, this means that the expected reduction in the consequences of\naccidents should be high enough to justify the costs.\n\nCost Effectiveness\n\nWhen dealing with costs and finances, it is natural to measure everything in terms of money. When dealing with the\nother matters, it is more difficult to use money as a performance measure. Thus, if an investment is proposed to\nimprove infrastructure performance, it will usually be difficult if not impossible to determine whether or not the non-\n\n1 The term \"risk\" is used in two different ways by safety engineers and financiers. To safety engineers, risk refers to accidents or\nincidents that result in property damage, injuries or fatalities, and that is the sense in which the term is used in this section. In\nfinance, the term is used to include any of the many factors that may affect the success of a project, including such things as the\nrisk of an economic downturn, the risk of new competition, and the risk of political upheaval as well as the risks related to safety\nand security. Both meanings are used in this text; which sense is being used should be clear from the context.\n\nmonetary benefits justify the financial cost of the investment. Ultimately, some kind of political process will be\nnecessary to weigh all of the costs and benefits to determine whether or not a proposed project is justified.\n\nThe concept of cost-effectiveness is a valuable technique that can be used in evaluating potential investments aimed\nat achieving non-monetary benefits. Cost-effectiveness is the ratio of the benefit to the cost of achieving that benefit.\nThus, as long as it is possible to measure a benefit, it is possible to calculate cost-effectiveness. If there are multiple\nways of achieving the same type of benefit, then the most cost-effective approach is the one that costs the least per\nunit of improvement. Just because an option is the most cost-effective does not mean that it is worth pursuing - it\nmay be better than any of the others, but it may still be judged to be too costly. Cost-effectiveness is therefore a\nconcept that is most useful in eliminating projects from consideration and in identifying ones that deserve further\nconsideration. A project will not be implemented simply because it is the most cost-effective.\n\nSummary\n\nTransportation, water resource and other infrastructure-based systems serve various needs of society. One aspect of\nthe performance of such systems is therefore how well they actually serve those needs, as measured by the cost to the\nuser and the quality of the service that they receive.\n\nTotal, average, marginal, and incremental costs are all important aspects of system performance. The average cost\nis the total cost divided by the total volume of usage; the units could be the cost/vehicle for a highway or the cost/gallon\nfor a municipal water system. The marginal cost is the cost per additional user, which would be the cost for one more\ncar on a highway or for an additional gallon of water. Pricing and operating decisions are often based upon marginal\ncosts rather than average costs. The incremental cost is the added cost for a larger increment of users, e.g. a 10%\nincrease in vehicles or water usage. Investment and longer-term operating decisions are often based upon consideration\nof incremental costs: what is the best way to handle the expected increase in usage over the next five years? It is\npossible to construct engineering-based cost functions that can be used to estimate costs based upon the engineering\nand operating characteristics of the system.\n\nFor many systems, it is useful to consider the distinction between fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are those\nassociated with making the system available, while variable costs are those that vary with the level of usage. For\ninvestments in infrastructure, there are often options that can provide better service or higher capacity, but that require\nhigher fixed costs. A common question is therefore to decide whether or not there will be sufficient demand to justify\nthe alternative with the higher fixed costs.\n\nSince infrastructure lasts a long time, it is important to consider costs over the entire life of the infrastructure. Design\ncosts are likely to be modest compared to the construction costs that follow. Once the project is completed, there will\ncosts of operation that may be borne by the owner, users or abutters. As the facility ages, it may be desirable to expand\nor to rehabilitate the facilities. Eventually, as a result of declining demand or excessive costs of maintenance, it will\nbe necessary to decommission the facilities and to salvage metal or whatever is left of value. Ideally, the design of\ninfrastructure-based systems will address total lifecycle costs, rather than simply construction costs. Adding room for\nexpansion, allowing more efficient operations, using designs that facilitate maintenance and ensuring safer operations\nmay require additional investment, but result in lower costs over the life of the infrastructure.\n\nThe design phase offers the greatest opportunity to affect the life cycle costs of a project. At this point, while all things\nwill not be possible, many things will be. A major design consideration will be the extent to which the owner or\ndeveloper considers the costs to users and abutters. Small changes in design conceivably produce more efficient\noperations or limit the negative effects on third parties, but only to the extent to which such costs are even considered\nin the design. Mistakes regarding the size of the project - too big, too small, too soon, too little flexibility, too difficult\nto rehabilitate, too much impact on neighbors - conceivably can be rectified with little or no additional time or expense\nrelated to construction.\n\n'i.e. the profitability and the return on investment for the system. The return on investment is the annual profit divided\nby the total amount of the investment. While financial performance is not the only measure, or even the most\nimportant measure, if financial performance is deemed to be unacceptable then it will be difficult or impossible to\nfind investors (or taxpayers) willing to invest more money in improving or expanding the system. The interaction\nbetween supply and demand will be an important factor determining the prices that can be charged for a service.\n\nA third aspect of performance will be the ability of the system to handle growth in demand. The maximum capacity\nof a system is limited by the initial design, engineering factors, and operating constraints. The maximum capacity\nmay be useful in design, but cannot be achieved except for brief periods. Operating capacity recognizes the importance\nof considering such things as the normal variations in volume, weather, and the need of routine maintenance. The\noperating capacity is what is achievable on most days when the system operates pretty much as planned. The limit to\noperating capacity is likely to be what users view as acceptable delays or restrictions on use during peak periods. The\nsustainable capacity is somewhat lower, because time must eventually be allowed for more maintenance and there\nwill be periods when severe weather or accidents disrupt operations for a period of hours, days, or weeks. Sustainable\ncapacity for most systems will be on the order of 70% of maximum capacity.\n\nA fourth aspect of performance will be the safety and security of the system, i.e. the likelihood of accidents or\ndisruptions to the system based upon system problems or attacks upon the system. Risk is a useful concept for\nconsidering safety and security issues, as risk is the product of two key factors: the likelihood of an accident or\nincident and the expected fatalities, injuries and other consequences if there is an accident or incident. Probabilistic\nrisk assessment is a methodology that can be used to determine the cost-effectiveness of various options for reducing\nrisk.\n\nFigure 13 Union Pacific's Rail Freight Terminal in North Platte, Nebraska\nDuring the late 20th century, the rail industry struggled to increase capacity to keep pace with\nthe demand for coal and the rapid growth in the shipment of containers by rail.\n\nEquivalence of Cash Flows\n\"What it comes down to is pieces of paper, numbers, internal rate of return, the net present\nvalue, discounted cash flows - that's what it's all about. ... Sure, we want to build quality and\nwe want to build something that is going to be a statement, but if you can't do that and still have\nit financed and make a return, then why are we doing it?\"\nTerry Soderberg1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany processes are needed to assess the performance of infrastructure projects and to evaluate alternatives for\nimproving performance. Inevitably, there will be many aspects of performance to consider and many possible impacts\non society or the environment that must be minimized or mitigated. Financial analysis, which is concerned with the\ncash flows directly related to a project, will be critical, but so will economic analysis, which also includes the impacts\nof a project on the overall economy. Both financial and economic impacts can be measured in monetary terms; which\ntypes of impacts are considered will depend upon who is doing the analysis. Owners, developers and users will largely\nbe interested in financial matters; public agencies that must approve projects are concerned with broader economic\nmatters, such as job creation and regional prosperity.\n\nFinancial impacts concern the cash flows that are directly related to the project; these cash flows are what will\ndetermine the profitability of the project and the returns to those who invest in the project. If there is not enough cash\nto support construction, then a project will not be completed; if it appears that revenues will be insufficient to provide\na desirable rate of return for investors, then they will not invest in the project. In Panama, the French effort to build\nthe canal suffered from the extraordinary loss of life, but the project failed because the interest charges on the\nconstruction debt rose higher than predicted revenues - and the canal was nowhere near to being finished.\n\nEconomic impacts are broader than financial impacts, as they may include costs and benefits related to such things as\nconsumer surplus, multiplier effects of construction, or safety, all of which are important factors to the public, even\nthough they may not show up as revenues or expenses related to the investment in or operation of the project. Financial\nand economic impacts together are likely to motivate many projects, but there will also be social and environmental\nobjectives and constraints that must be considered in proposing and evaluating projects that are aimed at enhancing\nthe sustainability of infrastructure-based systems. The Panama Canal was eventually completed only when the U.S.\ngovernment, which had strategic interests in a shorter all-water link between its east and west coasts, was able to invest\nwhat was needed to complete a less ambitious project, namely a canal with locks rather than a sea-level canal.\n\nIn this essay, the focus is on economic and financial aspects of projects, not because these are the most important\nmeasures of success, but because there are well-defined techniques that are commonly used to evaluate financial\nfeasibility and economic desirability of a project. The concept of net present value (NPV) provides a very useful\nmethod for determining whether the predicted future benefits of projects justify the investment. NPV also provides a\nuseful way for comparing different alternatives that may be proposed for a project.\n\nWhen seeking ways to improve infrastructure performance, there will always be many alternatives to consider. It may\nbe possible to improve performance by investment in markedly different types of infrastructure, by regulating land\nuse or development or by subsidizing certain types of activities. To determine which is best, from an economic or\nfinancial perspective, it will be necessary to compare costs and benefits over a long time period. Calculating the NPV\nfor each option provides a convenient way to make such a comparison.\n\n1 Terry Soderberg was in charge of leasing a 50-story office tower for the Worldwide Plaza, quoted by Karl Sabbagh in\nSkyscraper: The Making of a Building, Penguin Books, NY, NY, 1991, p. 377\n\nTo simplify the presentation, let's focus on financial matters.2 For each major alternative, it is necessary to predict\ncash flows over a long time horizon, taking into account the costs of construction, the continuing costs of maintenance,\nand the costs and revenues related to operations. A typical proposal will have cash flows similar to those shown in\nFigure 1, which shows the net annual cash flows over the life of a hypothetical project. Net cash flows are the sum of\nrevenues, subsidies and any other source of income minus investment, operating, maintenance and any other type of\nexpense. In a typical proposal, cash flows are negative at the outset, because of the expenses related to planning, site\nacquisition, and construction. Once the project is completed, revenues start to offset continuing costs of operation and\nmaintenance. Eventually, as the structures age or as competitors capture more of the market, net cash flows begin to\ndecline. At the end of the life, there may be expenses related with tearing down the structure.\n\nFigure 1 Cash Flows for a Typical Infrastructure Project\nCash Flow of a Typical CEE Project\nYear\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\nMillions of Dollars\n\nThe alternatives that must be investigated may have sizable differences in terms of investments, construction costs,\nperformance capabilities, and projected operating costs and revenue potential. Comparisons among options with\nmarkedly different cash flows will be difficult. For example, how should a low-cost option be compared with an\noption that requires much higher investment, but offers a chance to earn more money over a longer time frame? To\nanswer questions like this, it is necessary to understand a basic concept of engineering economics, namely the\nequivalence of cash flows. If someone - an individual, a public agency or a company - is indifferent between two\nprojected streams of cash flows, then those cash flows can be viewed as equivalent for that person, agency, or\ncompany. It is particularly useful to be able to take the complex flows of a typical project and compare them to\nsomething that is equivalent, but easier to understand. One obvious possibility would be to determine the amount of\ncash - the net present value - that would be equivalent to each projected stream of cash flows. The projected cash\nflows for each alternative could then be reduced to something as simple as a deposit to or a withdrawal from a bank\naccount, either today or at some point in the future. Comparing alternatives would then be trivial, at least in terms of\nfinancial matters: the bigger the deposit the better, any deposit is better than any withdrawal, and if the best option is\nequivalent to a withdrawal then it is clear that there better be some non-financial objective for pursuing the project!\nThis is why net present value is such a widely used measure of financial performance.\n\nThe next section goes into more detail concerning the time value of money, the need to discount future cash flows,\nthe concept of a discount rate, and the concept of equivalence. Equivalence relationships can most easily be\nunderstood in the context of fixed interest payments, where there is a well-defined relationship between money\ninvested today and the interest that will be earned over time\n\n2 Discounting and NPV analysis can be applied to any stream of costs and benefits that can be expressed in monetary terms. It is\nconvenient to begin by focusing on the cash flows that are directly related to the project, as the cash flows are well-defined and\neasily understood. Moreover, for most investors, private companies, and entrepreneurs, the analysis of cash flows dominates their\nconcerns.\n\nTime Value of Money\n\nCash today is worth more than a promise that you will receive the same amount of cash in the future. There are\nseveral reasons why this is so, including the opportunities for investing the cash today, the likelihood of inflation, and\nthe risk that the promised cash will not materialize. If the money is invested in a low-risk investment, such as savings\nbonds or a savings account at a bank, then the money will earn interest and the total amount available will be greater\nin the future. If the money is invested in stocks, bonds, or real estate, there could be even greater returns. Thus,\nthere is an opportunity cost if money is only available in the future rather than being available today.\n\nThe second major reason for preferring money today rather than in the future is that inflation will generally reduce\nwhat can be bought with a given amount of money. Having the same amount of money in the future will not be as\ngood as having the money today because it will not purchase as many goods and services.\n\nThe third major reason for preferring money today is financial risk: something could go wrong, causing the future\npayment to be smaller or later than expected. If the money is coming from the anticipated sale of property, there could\nbe less than expected if there is a decline in the housing market. If the money is coming from the repayment of a loan,\nperhaps the borrower will be unable to make the payment. If the money is linked to some sort of international deal,\nperhaps a change in government will reduce the revenue from the deal.\n\nThese and other factors all affect the time value of money. Since people have different needs and expectations about\nthe future, they will vary in their perceptions of investment opportunities, inflation, and financial risk, and different\npeople and different organizations will put different relative values on current and future sums of money. For now,\nsuffice it to say that there are several major reasons why money in the future is less valuable than money at hand in\nthe present. Therefore, it is necessary to discount future cash flows. \"Discount\" comes from a Latin term that means\n\"count for less,\" so discounting future cash flows means that they will count for less when evaluating a project. The\ndiscount rate is defined as the annual percentage by which future cash flows (a future value) must be reduced\n(discounted) to a present value for comparison with current cash.\n\nThe simplest way to understand discounting is to consider the benefits of investing in something safe that earns a\nrespectable, steady i% interest per year. After one year, the money will have increased by a factor of (1+i%). If the\nsame interest rate is maintained for t years, the money will have grown by a factor of (1+i%)t. In other words, assuming\nan interest rate of i%, M dollars today is equivalent to M(1+i%)t dollars in the future. To look at this same situation\nfrom the perspective of the future, M dollars in the future would be equivalent to M/(1+i%)t dollars today if those M\ndollars were invested and earning i% per year.\n\nFor example, suppose you deposit $1,000 in a bank that pays 4% interest at the end of each year. How much will you\nbe able to withdraw at the end of five years? To determine the future value of your deposit, it is necessary to begin\nby calculating the annual interest that will be received at the end of the first year and adding this interest to your\naccount. If the interest rate is 4%, then the value of the account will increase by 4% at the end of the year. The same\nprocedure can be repeated for four more years. The results will be as shown in Table 1; the value at the end of one\nyear equals the value at the beginning of the next year, and the value at the end of five years will be $1,216.65. This\nresult could also be obtained directly as $1000 * (1.04)5 = $1,216.65.\n\nTable 1 Future Value of Money Deposited in a Bank Account\nYear\nValue at Beginning\nof Year\nInterest Rate\nInterest Received at\nEnd of Year\nValue at End of\nYear\n$1,000\n4%\n$40\n$1,040.00\n$1,040\n4%\n$41.60\n$1,081.60\n$1,081.60\n4%\n$43.26\n$1,124.86\n$1,124.86\n4%\n$44.99\n$1,169.86\n$1,169.86\n4%\n$46.79\n$1,216.65\n\nIt is often useful to prepare a cash flow diagram that depicts exactly what is being analyzed. In such a diagram, it is\nimportant to know whether cash flows occur at the beginning, middle, or end of the period. The end of one period\ncan be assumed to equal the beginning of the next period. Figure 2 shows the cash flow diagram for Table 1. In this\ndiagram, it is assumed that cash flows occur at the beginning of the period. From your perspective, there are just two\ncash transactions: a deposit of $1000 deposit is made today and a withdrawal of $1216.65 is made five years later.\nThe annual interest payments will be added to your account and will not be taken as cash; they therefore are not shown\non this chart. The chart shows the deposit at the beginning of month 1 and the withdrawal five years later at the\nbeginning of month 61.\n\nFigure 2 Cash Flow Diagram for Table 1\n\nIn financial terms, the $1,000 that is invested at the beginning of the first month is equivalent to the $1,216.65 that\nwill be available at the end of the last month. The same chart could be used to illustrate the amount of money that\nmust be invested today to grow to $1,216.65 in 60 months.\n\nThe choice of a discount rate is a very important issue in project evaluation, because large investments in the near\nfuture must be justified by benefits that are achieved over a long time period. The more that those benefits are\ndiscounted, the harder it is to justify the investment. Table 2 illustrates the present value of $100 received five to 100\nyears in the future and discounted at a rate of 1 to 20%. The higher the discount rate or the longer the period, the\nlower the present value.\n\nTable 2 Present Value of $100 Received in 5, 10, 20 or 50 Years\nDiscount Rate\n5 Years\n10 Years\n20 Years\n50 Years\n1%\n$95\n$91\n$82\n$61\n5%\n8.80\n10%\n0.90\n20%\n2.60\n0.11\n\nEquivalence Relationships\n\nEquivalence is a key concept in project evaluation and project finance. Two projected streams of cash flows are\nequivalent for someone if they are equally acceptable, i.e. if the individual is indifferent to receiving one or the other.\nAs noted in the introduction, our goal is to transform an arbitrary stream of cash flows into an equivalent cash flow\n-$1,500\n-$1,000\n-$500\n$0\n$500\n$1,000\n$1,500\nMonth\nCash Flows\n\nthat is easily understood, such as present value, future value, or uniform annual value.3 Given a discount rate, it is\npossible to calculate these three measures so that each is equivalent to a given stream of cash flows:\n\n1. Present value or present worth (P): the equivalent present value of the cash flows (what is the projected\nstream of cash flows worth today?)\n2. Future value or future worth (F): the equivalent future value of the cash flows (what is it worth at a specified\ntime in the future?)\n3. Annual value or annuity worth (A): the equivalent annuity amount (what is it worth in terms of receiving a\nuniform cash flow of A at the end of each period for a specified number of periods).\n\nP, the present value of the cash flows, is clearly the easiest to understand. If we have a choice among various\nalternatives, each of which is equivalent to receiving a lump sum of money today, then the larger the present value the\nbetter (assuming for now that money is our chief object in life and that the money related to the various projects is\nindeed legally acquired!).\n\nThe other two measures are also easy to understand. If our time of reference is some time in the future, we will\npresumably want the alternative with the maximum future value. If we are more comfortable dealing with monthly\nor annual cash flows, then we can express options in terms of an annuity and choose the one that pays the most per\nperiod.\n\nThe basic tasks in financial analysis of a project can therefore be summarized as follows:\n\n-\nPredict the cash flows over the life of the project\n-\nEstimate the net present value of the cash flows\n-\nCalculate the equivalent future value or annuity, if desired\n-\nRank projects by P, F, or A (since they are equivalent measures, the ranking will be the same)\n\nLet's assume that we are a private company considering various projects that we can finance by borrowing from a\nbank at an interest rate of i%. For simplicity, assume that we can also put money into a savings account at the bank\nand also receive i% interest. Our choices therefore are either to invest in more projects or to put money into our bank\naccount. If a project earns more than i%, then we will borrow money from the bank; if it earns less than i%, we will\nbe better off putting money into our bank account.\n\nIt is useful to introduce some notation for discounting. [F/P,i,N] can be used to denote the factor that calculates the\nfuture value F as a fraction of the present value P, assuming a discount rate of i% for N periods. [P/F,i,N] denotes the\nfactor that is used to determine the present value P given the future value F, again assuming a discount rate of i% for\nN periods. The two factors are used as follows to compare future and present values:\n\n(Eq. 1)\nF = P * [F/P,i,N] = P * (1+i)N\n\n(Eq. 2)\nP = F * [P/F,i,N] = F / (1+i)N\n\nIt is a small step from discounting one future payment to discounting all anticipated cash flows over a project's time\nhorizon. If you have a spreadsheet, you can use these equations repeatedly to convert an arbitrary cash flow into either\na present or a future value. The present value of the entire stream of cash flows will be the sum of the individual\ndiscounted cash flows.\n\n3 Present value, future value, and equivalent uniform annual value are the terms most commonly used in general business.\nPresent worth PW, future worth FW, and annuity worth AW are encountered in many engineering economics textbooks. This\ntext uses the two sets interchangeably; the very common use of net present value may make the use of present and future value\nmore desirable.\n\nThe term net present value is commonly used to denote the present value of a stream of cash flows that includes both\ncosts C(t) and benefits B(t) over a designated time horizon. Given a discount rate i, it is straightforward to calculate\nthe net benefits during any period, the present value of those benefits, and the net present value (NPV) of the entire\nproject:\n\n(Eq. 3)\nNet benefits during period t = B(t) - C(t)\n\n(Eq. 4)\nPresent value of net benefits in period t = NPV(t) = (B(t) - C(t))/(1 + i)t\n\n(Eq. 5)\nNPV(project) = ((B(t) - C(t))/(1 + i)t) for the life of the project\n\nSometimes it is desirable to consider an annuity rather than a present or future value. An annuity can be compared to\nother measures reported annually, such as revenue, operating costs, or profitability. There are multiple ways to find\nthe equivalent annuity. Since an annuity of A per period is certainly one possible cash flow, you can find the annuity\nthat is equivalent to either a present or future value using the above equations. If you make interest rate, annuity\namount, and the number of periods a variable, you can easily find the annuity amount that is equivalent to any present\nor future value. However, it can be more elegant (and less time-consuming) to use algebraic expressions to convert P\nor F into annuities (or to convert annuities into P or F).\n\nThe equivalent future value F of an annuity A is the amount that would be accumulated by the end of the last payment\nassuming that all payments were invested so as to grow at a rate equal to the discount rate i. As was the case in\ncalculating the relationships between P and F, there will be an equivalence factor that can be used to find F as a\nfunction of A. This factor depends upon the discount rate per period and the number of periods. It is denoted [F/A,i,N],\nand it is called the uniform series compound amount factor. It is assumed that a payment of A is made at the end\nof each period and that each payment is invested at i% per period for the remaining periods.\n\nGiven i and N, the future value will be proportional to A, and [F/A,i,N] will be the proportionality factor:\n\n(Eq. 6)\nF = A * [F/A,i,N]\n\nThere is a simple algebraic expression for [F/A,i,N]:\n\n(Eq. 7)\n[F/A,i,N] = [(1+i)N-1]/i\n\nValues for the expression can be found in tables, and spreadsheets have functions that will calculate the expression\nfor you.\n\nDerivation of the Uniform Series Compound Amount Factor [F/A,i,N]\n\nThe derivation of this expression for [F/A,i,N] is based upon well-known relationships for geometric sequences. First,\nwe can calculate F just by converting each payment A(t) to a value at the end of the Nth period. The payment at the\nend of period t will earn interest for another N-t periods, so its future value will be:\n\n(Eq. 8)\nA(t) = A(1+i)N-t\n\nSumming over the entire N periods:\n\n(Eq. 9)\nF(N) = A ((1+i)N-1 + (1+i)N-2 + ... +(1+i)N-t + ... + (1+i)0 )\n\nIf we let b = 1+i, this is equivalent to a simple geometric sequence:\n\n(Eq. 10)\nF(N) = A ( bN-1 + bN-2 + ... + bN-t + ... + b0 )\n\nIf we rearrange the terms, then\n\n(Eq. 11)\nF(N) = A (1 + b + ... + bN-t + ... + bN-1 ) = A [F/A,i,N]\n\nAnd\n\n(Eq. 12)\n[F/A,i,N] = (1 + b + ... + bN-t + ... + bN-1 )\n\nNow use a mathematical trick: multiply this by one expressed as (1-b)/(1-b) to get a more elegant result:\n\n(Eq. 13)\n[F/A,i,N] = [1/(1-b)] [(1 + b + ... + bN-1 ) - (b + b2 + ... + bN-t +1 + ... + bN )]\n\n(Eq. 14)\n[F/A,I,N] = [1/(1-b)] [1-bN] = [1-bN] / (1-b)\n\nSubstitute (1+i) = b and rearrange terms to get the uniform series compound amount factor:\n\n(Eq. 15)\n[F/A,i,N] = [(1+i)N-1]/i\n\nExpressions for the Other Equivalence Factors\n\nExpressions for the other factors can readily be found. Since F(N) = A * [F/A,i,N] we can invert the above to get\n[A/F,i,N], which is known as the sinking fund factor:\n\n(Eq. 16)\n[A/F,i,N] = i/[(1+i)N-1]\n\nA sinking fund may be established by a local government or a company as a means of paying off a future debt. An\namount is paid each year into the sinking fund, which could be a savings account or another safe investment. Each\nyear, the sinking fund would earn interest, and at the end of the time period, enough would have accumulated to pay\noff the debt (or fix the roof on the town hall or deal with whatever problem the sinking fund was established to solve).\nThe relevant question is the size of the annuity.\n\nA related question involves the present worth of an annuity. This amount of money that will be available in the future\nif a specified amount is invested each period for n periods at interest rate i. This amount can be calculated using what\nis known as the uniform series present worth factor and symbolized as [P/A,i,N]. This factor represents the present\nvalue of the annuity, and the annuity has an equivalent future value represented by [F/A,i,N] (Equation 15). Taking\nthe present value of that future value will produce the desired uniform series present worth factor:\n\n(Eq. 17)\n[P/A,i,N] = [F/A,i,N] / (1+i)N\n\nThe uniform series present worth factor can be obtained by substituting for [F/A,i,N] using equation 15:\n\n(Eq. 18)\n[P/A,i,N] = [(1+i)N-1]/[i (1+i)N]\n\nThe inverse of this expression will give the capital recovery factor, which can be used to determine the size of an\nannuity that is required to recover an initial capital investment:\n\n(Eq. 19)\n[A/P,i,N] = [i (1+i)N]/[(1+i)N-1]\n\nThese expressions may not seem too elegant, nor are they easy to remember. However, note that when N gets large,\nthey become very clear and simple:\n\n(Eq. 20)\n[P/A,i,N] = 1/i\n\n(Eq. 21)\n[A/P,i,N] = i\n\nThese approximate expressions for the sinking fund and the capital recovery factors can be very useful in estimating\nthe present value of a long-term annuity or in estimating the present value of a long-term annuity. For example,\nsuppose a toll road generates $1 million per year in profit. What would that be worth to a potential purchaser with a\ndiscount rate of 10%? We could approach this by assuming a life of 30, 40 or 100 years and looking up the values for\n[P/A,10%,30], [P/A,10%,40] and [P/A,10%,100]. If we did this, we would find the following:\n\n($1 million) [P/A,10%,30] = $1 million (9.4269) = $9.4 million\n\n($1 million) [P/A,10%,40] = $1 million (9.7791) = $9.8 million\n\n($1 million) [P/A,10%,100] = $1 million (9.9993) =$10 million\n\nIf we had just used the approximation, we would immediately have said that\n\n($1 million) (1/0.1) = $10 million\n\nThis result is very close for 40 years and almost exact for 100 years. In many analyses, particularly preliminary\nanalyses where few if any of the numbers are precise, the approximation will be quite adequate.\n\nIn going from present value to annuities, we find a similar result. In this case, the question would concern the annual\nprofit that would be required to justify an investment of $10 million in a turnpike. The approximation says that the\nlong-term annuity would be approximately $1 million multiplied by the discount rate of 10% or $1 million per year.\nThe more precise calculations would call for somewhat higher returns, but nothing markedly greater than the quick\nestimate of $1 million:\n\n$10 million * [A/P,10%,30] = $10 million (.1061) = $1.06 million\n\n$10 million * [A/P,10%,40] = $10 million (.1023) = $1.02 million\n\nUsing these approximations is sometimes called the capital worth method.\n\nFigure 3 summarizes the concept of equivalence. The chart in the upper left shows a typical stream of cash flows for\na project. There are substantial investments during the first four years, profitable operations beginning in year five, a\ndip in earnings midway through the life of the project reflecting the need to expand or rehabilitate the project, and\nultimately a decline in profitability and a decommissioning expense. It is impossible to tell for sure how good this\nproject simply by looking these cash flows. The other three charts show the equivalent present value, annuity, and\nfuture value, each of which is easy to understand. Since the present value is positive, then investing in this project is\nbetter than investing in something that earns interest equal to the discount rate. If the present value is negative, then\nthe project is not as good as investing in something that earns interest equal to the discount rate.\n\nFigure 3 For a given discount rate, any arbitrary stream of cash flows\nwill be equivalent to a present value, a future value or an annuity\nEquivalence of Cash Flows\nTime\n-30\n-20\n-10\n$/Year\nTypical Cash Flows for a CEE Project\nTime\n$\nEquivalent Present Value\nTime\n$\nEquivalent Future Value\nTime\n$\nEquivalent Annuity\n\nTable 3 summarizes the six factors derived above. F refers to the future value, P to the present value, and A to the\nequivalent annuity amount. The equations are all functions of the discount rate i and the number of periods N. The\nfinal two rows of this table highlight the two easily remembered factors known as the \"Capital Worth Method.\" When\nN is large, these factors provide an easy way to get a quick estimate of the value of an annuity (A/i) or the annuity that\nis equivalent to any present amount (Pi).\n\nTable 3 Summary of Equivalence Factors, Discrete Compounding\nSymbol\nName\nComment\nValue\n[F/P,I,N]\nFuture value given present value\nHow much growth can be\nexpected\n(1+i)N\n[P/F,I,N]\nPresent value given future value\nDiscounted value of a future\namount\n1/(1+i)N\n[F/A,I,N]\nUniform series compound\namount factor\nIf I save some each period,\nhow much will I accumulate?\n[(1+i)N-1]/i\n[A/F,I,N]\nSinking fund payment\nHow much must I save each\nperiod to meet my retirement\ngoals?\ni/[(1+i)N-1]\n[A/P,I,N]\nCapital recovery factor\nWhat will my mortgage\npayment be?\n[i (1+i)N]/[(1+i)N-1]\n[P/A,I,N]\nUniform series present worth\nfactor\nIf I can pay A per month,\nhow large a mortgage can I\nafford?\n[(1+i)N-1]/[i (1+i)N]\n[A/P,I,infinity]\nCapital recovery factor for very\nlong time periods\nCapital Worth Method\ni\n[P/A,I,infinity]\nUniform series present worth\nfactor for very long time periods\nCapital Worth Method\n1/i\n\nThe next two figures illustrate the relationship between annuities and present or future worth. Figure 4 shows the\n\"uniform series, compound amount factor\", which is the amount by which the future value exceeds the annual amount\nof an annuity depending upon the length of time and the earnings rate. This is the factor that is useful in determining\nhow much should be invested each year toward retirement. Figure 5 shows the annuity that is equivalent to a present\n\nvalue for various time periods and interest rates. This factor is called the \"uniform series, capital recovery factor\",\nand an example would be the amount that is paid each year on a mortgage.\n\nFigure 4 Uniform Series, Compound Amount Factor [F/A,i,N]\nUniform Series, Compound Amount\nFactor [F/A,i,N]\nYears\nF/A\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n\nFigure 5 Uniform Series, Capital Recovery Factor [A/P,i,N]\nUniform Series, Capital Recovery\nFactor [A/P,i,N]\nYears\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\nA/P\n5%\n7%\n9%\n\nContinuous Compounding: Nominal vs. Effective Interest Rates\n\nInterest rates are normally expressed in terms of annual returns, and the nominal rate of interest is the interest rate\nthat you would receive if interest were compounded annually. If interest is compounded more frequently, then there\nwill be a higher effective rate of interest. With a 12% nominal rate, an investment of $1000 on January 1 would earn\n$120 interest on December 31. However, if you compound interest semiannually, then you would get more interest.\nFirst after 6 months, you would earn 6% or $60 on your initial investment. Then, at the end of the year, you would\nearn another $60 on the initial investment plus $3.60 on the interest that you received at the end of June. For the year,\nyou therefore earned an effective rate of 12.36% interest on your investment, even though the nominal rate was 12%.\n\nMore rapid compounding gives a bit higher effective rate, but there are diminishing returns:\n\nQuarterly rate is 12.55%\n\nBimonthly rate is 12.62%\n\nMonthly rate is 12.68%\n\nDaily rate is 12.75%\n\nClearly, this is approaching a limit as interest is compounded more frequently. It turns out that all of the formulas for\ndiscrete cash flows can be revised into expressions for continuous compounding by substituting erN for (1 + i)N, where\nr is the nominal rate of interest and i is the effective rate (Table 4). For example, if the nominal rate is 12%, as in the\nexample we have been discussing, then erN ~2.7180.12 = 1.1275 which equals 1 plus the effective daily rate of 12.75%\nthat we just calculated.\n\nThe nuances of nominal versus effective rates will be important in certain areas, notably in banking and finance, where\ncontracts will specify interest rates and compounding periods. If you are buying a car or making a deposit to a savings\naccount, these details will affect the size of your payments or your earnings. In project evaluation - especially during\nthe early stages of the process - the differences between discrete and continuous compounding will be minor compared\nto the uncertainties in estimating costs, revenues, time periods, and other factors that will affect the outcome of the\nanalysis.\n\nTable 4 Summary of Equivalence Factors, Continuous Compounding\nSymbol\nName\nComment\nValue\n[F/P,I,N]\nFuture value given present value\nHow much growth can be\nexpected\nerN\n[P/F,I,N]\nPresent value given future value\nDiscounted value of a future\namount\n1/ erN\n[F/A,I,N]\nUniform series compound\namount factor\nIf I save some each period,\nhow much will I accumulate?\n[erN -1]/r\n[A/F,I,N]\nSinking fund payment\nHow much must I save each\nperiod to meet my retirement\ngoals?\nr/[ erN -1]\n[A/P,I,N]\nCapital recovery factor\nWhat will my mortgage\npayment be?\n[r (erN )]/[ erN -1]\n[P/A,I,N]\nUniform series present worth\nfactor\nIf I can pay A per month,\nhow large a mortgage can I\nafford?\n[erN -1]/[r (erN )]\n[A/P,I,infinity]\nCapital recovery factor for very\nlong time periods\nCapital Worth Method\nR\n[P/A,I,infinity]\nUniform series present worth\nfactor for very long time periods\nCapital Worth Method\n1/r\n\nSome Useful Approximations\n\nThe continuous compounding formulations for [F/P,r,N] and [P/F,r,N] are very useful because they are easy to\nremember and can readily be used for quick approximations. Since [F/P,r,N] = erN and [P/F,r,N] = 1/ erN , it can be\nvery helpful to remember a few useful results:\n\nIf rN = 1, erN = 2.718...\n\nIf rN = 0.7, erN = 2.013..., approximately 2\n\nIf rN = 1.1, erN = 3.004..., approximately 3\n\nIf rN = 1.4, erN = 4.055..., approximately 4\n\nYou can use these relationships to figure out how long it will take to double, triple or quadruple your money. If rN =\n2, then money invested at r% for N years will double in value. If the nominal interest rate is 10%/year, then it will\ntake seven years to double your money; if the nominal rate is 5%, then it will take 14 years to double your money.\nLikewise, if rN = 1.1, then erN ~ 3 and the future value will be about three times the present value. Thus, if you earn\n10% per year for eleven years, you can triple your money. You can also use the inverse relationship to calculate\npresent values. For example, if the nominal interest rate is 7%, then the present value of something received in ten\nyears will be half its future value.\n\nIn short, it is possible to make mental estimates of quite complex functions made up of incomprehensible expressions\nsuch as (1+i)n. Mental math has been an increasingly undervalued skill since the invention of the electronic calculator,\nbut you will certainly find it useful to use the above relationships if you are ever involved in face-to-face discussions,\nnegotiations, or debates related to project evaluation when it would be inconvenient or inappropriate to use your\ncalculator or computer. You can do present value analysis in your head - and that will give you an advantage in\nnegotiation!\n\nProof that erN = (1 + i)N\n\nTo prove this relationship, we can begin by writing an algebraic expression for what we are doing as we compound\nmore frequently. If r is the nominal interest rate, but we compound M times per year, then the effective rate will be\n\n(Eq. 22)\ni = [1 + (r/M)]M - 1\n\nand the factor [F/P,r%,1] will be\n\n(Eq. 23)\n[F/P,r%,1] = [1 + (r/M)]M\n\nNote that the term \"r%\" represents the nominal interest rate r and the use of continuous compounding.\n\nIf we let p = M/r and rewrite this equation, we get\n\n(Eq. 24)\n[F/P,r%,1] = (1 + 1/p)rp = ((1 + 1/p)p)r\n\nThis is a classic relationship, as the limit of (1+1/p)p as p approaches infinity is e = 2.7128...!\nThus, we have\n\n(Eq. 25)\n[F/p,r%,1] = er\n\nand therefore\n\n(Eq. 26)\n[F/P,r%,N] = erN\n\nwhich somewhat unexpectedly gives us a very nice relationship:\n\n(Eq. 27)\n[F/P,r%,N] = erN = (1 + i)N\n\nwhere the exponential expression assumes continuous compounding using the nominal rate and the other expression\nuses the effective rate. Hence, we can revise all of the formulas for discrete cash flows into expressions for continuous\ncompounding by substituting erN = (1 + i)N.\n\nFinancing Mechanisms\n\nEquivalence relationships enable financing of large projects. Those investors or banks that have money to invest are\nwilling to make cash available for implementing a project in return for future interest payments, mortgage payments,\nor dividends. This section describes financing mechanisms that are used for infrastructure projects.\n\nMortgages\n\nA mortgage is a loan that is backed by property. If the borrower defaults on a payment, then the lender can seize the\nproperty and either use it or sell it to recover their costs. From the lender's perspective, a mortgage is less risky than\na long-term unsecured loan, and therefore merits a lower interest rate. A mortgage will typically be limited to about\n80% of the assessed value of the property in order to reduce the risk to the lender in case the owner defaults. If the\nmortgage is less than the value of the property, then the bank will be able to sell the property and regain its investment.\n\nThe monthly payments on a mortgage depend on the amount of the loan (the principal amount), the interest rate and\nthe period of the mortgage. If the mortgage principal is PRICE, the annual interest rate is i% and the term is N years,\nthen the monthly payment will be:\n\n(Eq. 28)\nM = (PRICE) [A/P,i%,N]\n\nwhere [A/P,i%,N] = [i (1+i)N]/[(1+i)N-1] as shown in Table 3. This factor can be found in several ways. It can of\ncourse be calculated using the formula, but it can also be obtained from a table (e.g. Table 5) and it can be obtained\nusing a function available on many spreadsheets.

To\nobtain the annual payment, the amount of the loan needs to be multiplied by the capital recovery factor [A/P,i%,N],\nwhich Table 5 shows to be 0.0888 for a 30-year mortgage with an 8% interest rate,. The annual payment would\ntherefore be approximately $88,800:\n\n(Eq. 29)\nPMT = (PRICE) [A/P, 8%, 30] = $1,000,000 (0.0888) = $88,800\n\nIf payments were to be made monthly, then the PMT would be approximately 1/12th of the annual amount or $7,333.33.\nThese amounts are approximate because the table only shows the capital recovery factor to four significant digits.\nMore accurate answers for annual or monthly mortgage amounts could be obtained by using the formula for the capital\nrecovery factor or more readily by using the PMT function in Excel:\n\n(Eq. 30)\nAnnual payment = PMT(8%, 30, $1,000,000) = $88,827.43\n\n4 The Excel function is PMT(interest rate, number of periods, present value). Tables such as Table 5 can easily be created in any\nspreadsheet.\n\nTo obtain the monthly payment, it is necessary to use the monthly interest rate and 360 monthly payments. Using the\nPMT function, the result is:\n\n(Eq. 31)\nMonthly payment = PMT(8%/12, 360, $1,000,000] = $7337.65\n\nThese results are slightly higher than the results obtained using the factor from Table 5. The bank would be sure to\nuse the actual number, but the difference is far too small to make any difference in project evaluation, which naturally\nmust deal with many ill-defined numbers when comparing options. Neither the amount of the loan nor the interest\nrate would be known with certainty until a particular option has been chosen and the project is almost completed.\n\nAfter making mortgage payments for several years, an owner may decide to refinance the mortgage. The most likely\nreasons for refinancing would be to reduce monthly payments or to obtain cash:\n\n-\nInterest rates may be lower, so that the mortgage payment could be reduced.\n-\nThe mortgage could be extended over a longer time period in order to reduce monthly payments.\n-\nIt may be possible increase the size of the mortgage and extend the term of the mortgage without increasing\nthe size of the monthly payment.\n-\nIf the value of the property has increased, the owner may be able to borrow additional money for another\nproject.\n\nThere are three steps in refinancing:\n\n1. Figure out the remaining balance on the initial loan.\n2. Negotiate terms for the new loan.\n3. Close on the new mortgage:\na.\nUse some of the proceeds to pay off the original loan\nb. Give a check to the mortgagee for any additional funds that are borrowed.\n\nThe remaining balance on the new loan can be calculated as of a point in time immediately after a regular mortgage\npayment has been made. The remaining balance could be calculated in multiple ways:\n\n1. Read the statement: the monthly or annual statements will show the amount outstanding as of the previous\npayment, the amount due for the current payment, and the portion of the payment that goes toward interest\nand principal. This is what homeowners look at when they are considering refinancing.\n2. Calculate the value of all the payments that have been made so far and subtract from the original amount of\nthe loan.\n3. Calculate the value of the remaining payments, using the interest rate of the loan as a discount rate. This is\nequivalent to what must be repaid to the bank.\n\nThese calculations will involve multiple applications of various equivalence factors. For example, suppose that\npayments had been made for 15 years on the 30-year, 8% mortgage for $1 million that was described above. If the\nborrower has a chance to refinance with a 20-year mortgage carrying a 6% interest rate, what would the new payments\nbe? First, it is necessary to calculate the amount remaining on the mortgage. Assume that the borrower just made the\n15th payment, so that there would be 15 more payments due on the original 30-year mortgage. Although half the\npayments have been made, much less than half the loan has been paid off, because most of the payments have gone\ntoward interest.\n\nThere are various ways to calculate the amount remaining. One way would be to subtract the amounts paid off each\nyear from the initial purchase price. The first payment of $88,827 included $80,000 interest (8% of $1 million) and\ntherefore a principal payment of $8,827. With a spreadsheet, it is possible to continue the analysis, reducing the\n\nremaining principal by the proper amount after each payment as shown in Table 6. The amount remaining after the\n15th year is the amount shown at the beginning of year 16, namely $760,317.\n\nTable 6 Payments of Principal and Interest and Remaining Balance\nOver the Life of a 30-year Mortgage for $1 million at 8% Interest\nYear\nMortgage\nbalance\nPayment\nInterest\nPrincipal\n$1,000,000\n$88,827\n$0\n$0\n$1,000,000\n$88,827\n$80,000\n$8,827\n$991,173\n$88,827\n$79,294\n$9,534\n$981,639\n$88,827\n$78,531\n$10,296\n$971,343\n$88,827\n$77,707\n$11,120\n$960,223\n$88,827\n$76,818\n$12,010\n$948,213\n$88,827\n$75,857\n$12,970\n$935,243\n$88,827\n$74,819\n$14,008\n$921,235\n$88,827\n$73,699\n$15,129\n$906,106\n$88,827\n$72,488\n$16,339\n$889,767\n$88,827\n$71,181\n$17,646\n$872,121\n$88,827\n$69,770\n$19,058\n$853,063\n$88,827\n$68,245\n$20,582\n$832,481\n$88,827\n$66,598\n$22,229\n$810,252\n$88,827\n$64,820\n$24,007\n$786,244\n$88,827\n$62,900\n$25,928\n$760,317\n$88,827\n$60,825\n$28,002\n$732,314\n$88,827\n$58,585\n$30,242\n$702,072\n$88,827\n$56,166\n$32,662\n$669,410\n$88,827\n$53,553\n$35,275\n$634,136\n$88,827\n$50,731\n$38,097\n$596,039\n$88,827\n$47,683\n$41,144\n$554,895\n$88,827\n$44,392\n$44,436\n$510,459\n$88,827\n$40,837\n$47,991\n$462,468\n$88,827\n$36,997\n$51,830\n$410,639\n$88,827\n$32,851\n$55,976\n$354,662\n$88,827\n$28,373\n$60,454\n$294,208\n$88,827\n$23,537\n$65,291\n$228,917\n$88,827\n$18,313\n$70,514\n$158,403\n$88,827\n$12,672\n$76,155\n$82,248\n$88,827\n$6,580\n$82,248\n$0\n\nA more elegant approach is to think about the value of the remaining payments rather than worrying about the\ncontributions so far to principal and interest. From the lender's perspective, they are receiving 15 more payments at\nthe original 8% interest rate. The value of this annuity, discounted at 8%, will also give the amount remaining on the\nmortgage:\n\n(Eq. 32)\nOutstanding amount = $88,000 * [P/A, i%,15] = $88,800 * 8.5595 = $760,084\n\nThis amount is slightly less than the balance of $760,317 shown in the table due to rounding errors. With either\nanswer, we can express the outstanding amount as $761 thousand and estimate the new mortgage payment as just over\n$66 thousand:\n\n(Eq. 33)\nNew payment = $761,000 * [A/P, 6%, 20] = 761,000 * .0872 = $66,359\n\nThus, by refinancing, the borrower can reduce the annual mortgage payment by $22 thousand. The annual payments\nare lower because of the lower interest rate and also because the repayment period has been extended by 5 years (15\nremaining years on the original mortgage vs. 20 years on the new mortgage).\n\nThis example illustrates how multiple paths may be used to reach the same answer. The equivalence relationships can\nbe used repeatedly, in different ways, and so long as the logic is correct along each path, they will each reach the\ncorrect destination.\n\nBonds\n\nBonds provide a way for companies or agencies to raise money. A bond is offered with a face value V, a life of N\nyears, and annual interest of i%. Interest payments are made at the end of each year for N-1 years. At the end of the\nNth year, the owner receives the final interest payment and the bond is redeemed for its original face value. Bonds are\ncommonly sold in denominations of $1000 with a 30-year term, but other options are available. Bonds can be bought\nand sold over their lifetime, so it is possible to buy a 30-year bond that will become due in less than 30 years. Bonds\ncan even be offered as zero coupon bonds, in which the seller pays no interest but promises to pay the face value at\nthe end of the term; for these bonds, the purchase price will be much less than the face value.\n\nBonds are supported by the credit of the issuing agency or company; if the company fails to pay interest when it is\ndue, then the bond-holders can force the company into bankruptcy. If the company declares bankruptcy, then the\nassets of the company are divided up among the creditors, including the bondholders. Various credit agencies rate the\nquality of bonds, so that investors have a reasonable idea of the risks involved in buying the bonds. The higher the\nperceived risks of the issuing agency or company, the lower the credit rating on the bonds, and the higher the interest\nrates that must be offered to attract investors.\n\nThree interesting questions are 1) the value of the bond to an investor and 2) the change in the value of the bond as\ninterest rates change, and 3) the change in the value of the bond as perceived risks associated with the issuing agency\nor company change. The value of the bond to an investor depends upon the investor's perception of the risks involved,\nthe investor's discount rate for bonds with such risks, and the interest rates offered for the bond. If the investor's\ndiscount rate is lower than the interest rate that is offered, the investor will consider buying the bond. Market forces\nrelated to the supply and demand for fixed interest securities will determine what interest rates are actually required\nto sell bonds.\n\nAssume that the bond is sold at time 0. The seller agrees to pay interest of i% per year for N years and, at the end of\nN years, to pay back the face value of the bond. The seller offers the bonds to the marketplace, and potential purchasers\ndecide whether or not they want to buy the bonds. The purchasers may plan to hold the bonds until maturity, or they\nmay merely view the bonds as a short- or medium-term investment. The value of a high quality bond to an investor\ncan be calculated as follows:\n\n(Eq. 34)\nValue = Annual Interest [P/A, i%, N] + Face Value [P/F, i%, N]\n\nThe first term is the present worth of the N annual interest payments and the second term is the present worth of the\nfinal redemption of the bond at its original face value. It is crucial to recognize that the investor's discount rate of i%\ncan be higher or lower than the interest rate on the bond. If there is a possibility that the bond will default, both terms\ncould be reduced by a factor representing the probability that interest or the final redemption would not be made.\n\nAssuming that the probability of default is close to zero, the value of a bond to an investor will depend upon the face\nvalue, the years to maturity, the interest rates, and the discount rate of the investor. If the face value is $1,000 and the\ninterest rate is 6% for a 30-year bond, then the value to a potential purchaser who also has a 6% discount rate will be\nexactly $1,000:\n\n(Eq. 35)\nValue = ($1,000) (0.06) [P/A, 6%, 30] + $1,000 [P/F, 6%, 30]\n\n= $60 (13.7648) + $1,000 (0.1741)\n\n= $826 + $174 = $1,000\n\nFor someone with a discount rate of 5%, the bond will be worth much more:\n\n(Eq. 36)\nValue = $60 (15.3725) + $1,000 (0.2314)\n\n= $922 + $231 = $1,153\n\nLikewise, someone with a discount rate of greater than 6% would value the bond at less than $1,000. In each case the\nequivalence factors were obtained from a table of equivalence factors.\n\nThe same type of calculations can be used to show how the value of a bond could change if interest rates change. For\nexample, suppose that 20 years have gone by and interest rates on similar bonds have fallen to 5%. The 6% bond is\ntherefore paying more interest than a bond with similar risk would have to pay today; hence, investors would find that\nbond more appealing. Someone with a 5% discount rate would be willing to pay $1,000 for the bond paying 5%, but\nwould pay more for the 6% bond with 10 years until maturity:\n\n(Eq. 37)\nValue = $60 [P/A, 5%, 10] + $1000 [P/F, 5%, 10]\n\n= $60 (7.7217) + $1,000 (0.6139)\n\n= $463 + $614 = $1077\n\nThus, when interest rates fall, bond values rise. In this instance, note that the redemption value is now much greater\nthan the value of the interest payments. As the bond approaches maturity, the redemption value dominates.\n\nSinking Funds\n\nA sinking fund can be established to meet expected future capital needs, such as paying the principal on bonds when\nthey become due or conducting a major rehabilitation of a factory at some distant point in the future. Companies or\nagencies can pay a constant amount into a fund that is maintained solely to cover this future capital need. As shown\nabove, the sinking fund factor [A/F,i%,N] can be used to determine the annual amount A to invest at i% to reach the\ngoal of having an amount F at the end of N periods.\n\nThe calculations will require another step if the future need is itself an annuity. For example, planning for retirement\ninvolves consideration of three questions. First, how much will be needed in annual income after retirement. Second,\nhow much will be needed in savings to produce this level of retirement income. Third, how much will need to be\nsaved each year (e.g. in a sinking fund) in order to have accumulated the money that will be used to purchase the\nretirement annuity. The first question is a matter of personal needs and desires; in effect, it is necessary to determine\nhow large an annuity will be needed to support your desired lifestyle in retirement. The second question is a matter\nof equivalence: how much will be needed to purchase the retirement annuity? This is the retirement goal. The third\nquestion is a different matter of equivalence: how much do you have to save each year to reach your retirement goal?\nThe relevant equations are as follows:\n\n(Eq. 38)\nRetirement Goal = Retirement Annuity [P/A,i%,N]\n\n(Eq. 39)\nSavings Goal = Retirement Goal [A/F,g%, M]\n\nThe key unknowns are a) how much will really be needed, b) what interest rate (i%) can you expect for the annuity,\nand what annual return on investment (g%) can you expect on your savings. Perhaps the most interesting variable for\nmany people will be M, the years until retirement. The more that is saved, the higher the return on investment, and\nthe higher the interest rate on the retirement annuity, the sooner you can retire. The longer you work the more time\nyou will have to reach your retirement goal, and the less you will need to save each year to reach that goal.\n\nConsider a 30-year old couple planning for retirement. They would like to save a constant amount per year in a tax-\ndeferred investment account. After working for another 30 years, they hope to have accumulated enough funds to\nprovide an annuity that will last them until they are 100 years old or older. If they can achieve earnings of 8% per\nyear on their investments, how much should they save each year in order to be able to have $80,000 per year if they\nretire at age 60 and live forever?\n\nTo answer this, assume a discount rate of 8% for all of the calculations. While it is unlikely that they will live forever,\nthat hope at least makes the analysis a bit easier: the anticipated 8% return on their accumulated retirement investments\nwill be $80,000, so they will need to accumulate $80,000/0.08 = $1 million by age 60 (note that this approach uses\nthe simple capital worth method to convert the desired annuity into a required sum). The question therefore is what\nlevel of annual investment is needed to accumulate a million dollars in 30 years if returns are 8%?\n\n(Eq. 40)\nAnnual investment = $1,000,000 [A/F, 8%, 30] = $1,000,000 * (.0088) = $8,800\n\nThis may seem steep. If they extend their planned retirement ten years to age 70, then they will only need to invest\n$3,900 per year:\n\n(Eq. 41)\nAnnual investment = $1,000,000 * [A/F, 8%, 40] = $1,000,000 * .0039 = $3,900\n\nToll-Based Financing\n\nFor highways and bridges that carry a lot of traffic, it may be possible to use the projected toll revenues to justify\nissuing bonds that are sufficient to cover the cost of construction. Some quick estimates may indicate whether or not\ntoll-based financing will work. The interest on the bonds must be compared to the net revenue from the tolls, which\nis what is left after paying for the annual operating costs of the bridge. If the net toll revenue is well above the\nanticipated interest payments, then this would be a good candidate for toll-based financing.\n\nConsider a proposal for a bridge that is expected to cost $50 million to construct and $3 million per year for operating\nand maintenance costs. The bridge is expected to serve five to ten million vehicles per year, and the governor believes\nthat the public would view a toll of $1 to $2 as reasonable. Will the tolls cover the cost of bonds that could be sold to\npay the construction costs of the bridge? Interest rates on the bonds are expected to be 4%.\n\nGiven the projected traffic volume, the bridge would earn $5 to $20 million per year with a toll of $1 or $2. After\ndeducting $3 million per year for operating expenses, the net revenue would $2 to $17 million. Give the interest rate\nof 4%, the annual interest on the $50 million investment would be $2 million. Thus, even the lowest estimate of net\nrevenue would cover the annual interest payments on bonds. With a $2 toll, funds would be available for related\nprojects, such as improving access roads or providing support to other transportation projects.\n\nSummary\n\nWhen evaluating projects, it will be necessary to compare costs and benefits that are incurred over a period of many\nyears. The costs of the project are generally concentrated at the outset of the project, as benefits do not begin until\nconstruction is at least partially completed. One basic question for any proposed project is whether or not the eventual\nbenefits will be sufficient to justify an initial investment in a project. In most situations, there will be multiple\nalternatives to consider, each with its own investment requirements, time table, and projected stream of future costs\nand benefits. A second basic question is to determine which project - which projected set of cash flows - is most\ndesirable. While these are not the only questions that must be answered to determine whether a project can be justified,\nthey are questions that will certainly be considered by investors, bankers, and entrepreneurs who are considering\nparticipating in such projects. It is therefore essential to understand how such financial comparisons are made.\n\nThe first critical concept concerns the time value of money. There are several reasons why money in the future is\nworth less than the same amount of money available in the present. First, if money is available today, there is an\nopportunity cost: the money could be put into a savings account or invested so that it will be worth more in the\nfuture. Second, inflation is likely to reduce the purchasing power of money, so that today's money will buy more\ngoods and services than the same amount of money would be expected to purchase in the future. Third, there is a risk\nthat the actual money that becomes available in the future will be less than was predicted. It is therefore necessary to\ndiscount future cash flows in order to determine their present value. The higher the discount rate that is used, the\nlower the present value. The greater the potential for growth, the higher the expected rate of inflation, and the greater\nthe risk associated with the proposed investment, the higher the discount rate that will be used.\n\nBy discounting costs and benefits over the life of a project, it is possible to determine the net present value (NPV) of\nthe project. If the NPV is positive, then the project is worth more than doing nothing; if the NPV is negative, then the\nproject is not worth pursuing, at least from a financial perspective. By estimating the NPV for a set of alternatives,\nthen it is possible to determine which is worth the most financially. Maximizing the net present value of cash flows\nis a common financial objective for the private sector, although public projects are likely to have more complex\nobjectives.\n\nDiscounting provides a means of establishing equivalence between two sets of cash flows. If the cash flows are\nequivalent for a company or an individual, then that company or individual is indifferent between them. The\nconceptual power of discounting is that it provides a straight-forward methodology for establishing a NPV that is\nequivalent to any arbitrary set of projected cash flows. In particular, it is possible to establish equivalence between a\npresent value P and a future value F or an annuity A. Factors that relate P, F, and A are functions of the discount\nrate and time. These equivalence factors make it possible to compare cash flows in various ways, depending upon\nwhat is most useful for a particular analysis.\n\nEquivalence relationships are used to determine mortgage payments, the value of bonds, and other financing\nmechanisms. A mortgage is a financing mechanism in which a bank or other financial company provides a large\npayment in return for a series of monthly payments over a period of many years. If the mortgage payments are not\nmade, then the mortgage is in default, and the bank can foreclose on the property. A company or agency can sell\nbonds to raise money for a project; the bonds are purchased by investors who receive interest payments over the life\nof the bond and also receive the full value of the bond at the end of life of the bond. If the company or agency fails to\nmake the interest payments or is unable to redeem the bonds as they become due, then the company or agency may be\nforced into bankruptcy.\n\nThe concept of equivalence can be used in cost models, where it is often necessary to consider both investment costs\nand annual operating costs. The investment cost must be converted to an equivalent annual cost in order to be added\nto operating cost and used to determine such things as the cost per unit of capacity or the cost per user.\n\nChoosing a Discount Rate\nThe world's largest iron-ore producer [sold]$1 billion in investment grade bonds due in 2016 priced to\nyield 6.254%. Cia. Vale do Rio Doce, which last year became the first Brazilian corporation to win an\ninvestment grade rating, issued the debt to help fund its repurchase of $300 million of its 9% bonds due\nin 2013, thereby cutting the company's borrowing costs.\nCVRD Issues Record Bond, LatinFinance, February 2006, p. 4\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe concept of equivalence is essential to evaluating infrastructure projects that require substantial investments before\nany benefits are obtained. Given a discount rate, it is possible to relate any arbitrary sequence of cash flows to an\nequivalent present worth or future worth or to an annuity that continues indefinitely or for a fixed number of periods.\nGiven the projected costs and benefits, it is possible to calculate the net present value of a project, which can then\neasily be compared to the net present value for other projects. However, this extremely useful concept depends upon\nhaving a discount rate, and the selection of a discount rate is a complicated and ultimately quite subjective matter.\nThe discount rate cannot be established by fiat, nor is there a methodology that can be used to determine the exact\ndiscount rate that someone should use in evaluating a project. Moreover, the various people and organizations\nconsidering a project are likely to use quite different discount rates in evaluating the same project. Since the discount\nrate determines the importance of future financial costs and benefits, it is necessary to give some thought to the choice\nof a discount rate.\n\nThe discount rate is similar, but not identical to the rate of return. The discount rate is a conceptual figure that is\nuseful in establishing equivalence of cash flows, whereas the rate of return is an accounting term that is used in\ndescribing past or predicted financial performance of companies. Historically, rates of return have been higher for\nriskier investments, because investors discount future earnings more heavily for such investments. The greater the\nperceived risks associated with stocks or bonds, the lower the prices that they will command - and the higher the costs\nfor the company or agency trying to raise capital for a project. The discount rate used to evaluate projects should be\nat least as high as the rate of return that could be obtained via other investments with similar risks. The minimum\nattractive rate of return for a company will be at least equal to its cost of capital - and perhaps much higher.\n\nThe concept of a discount rate may seem to be a rather arcane topic, but it has clear and important consequences for a\ncompany or a government agency. The quote at the beginning of this chapter describes how a company was able to\nreduce its interest costs from 9% to 6.254% because the financial community upgraded the company's credit rating.\nWith lower interest on $300 million worth of bonds, the company saved approximately $8 million per year in interest\nfrom 2006 through 2013. How the financial community views the risks associated with a company can be extremely\nimportant to the profitability and even the survival of that company.\n\nProfits and Rate of Return vs. Net Present Value\n\nCompanies and investors often think in terms of profits and return on investment as well as or instead of present worth\nor future worth. Profit and return on investment are both accounting terms. Profit is the difference between revenue\nand expense, while return on investment is the ratio of profit to the total amount invested. In the simplest case, an\ninvestment of I at time 0 results in annual profits of A/year over a very long time horizon. In this simple case, the\nannual return on investment would always be A/I. While this simple logic is fine for, say, buying bonds, it is\ninsufficient for investments in infrastructure. The first problem is that the investment does not occur at time 0, but\nmay in fact require years of effort. The second problem is that the revenues and expenses associated with the project\nare likely to vary over the life of the project. The third problem is that tax laws and accounting conventions determine\nwhat is called an expense and what is called an investment; the way that legislators and accountants consider financial\nmatters may be quite different from the ways that entrepreneurs, companies and investors do their analysis.\n\nThe first two problems can be addressed by use of the concept of equivalence, assuming that an appropriate discount\nrate is given. The actual investments that take place over a period of months or years can be related to an equivalent\ntotal investment either at time 0 or at the time the project is completed and the operation begins. Likewise, the net\nbenefits can be converted to an equivalent long-term annuity that begins either at time 0 or at the time that operation\nbegins. The return on investment would then be the ratio of the equivalent annuity to the equivalent investment.\n\nThe problems related to accounting and taxes are trickier. Profit and return on investment are defined by legislation\nand accounting rules, and it is not possible to adjust the definitions of these terms to be consistent with some other\nview of the world, e.g. the emphasis on net present value of cash flows that is presented in this text and other texts on\nengineering economy, management science, and project evaluation. The generally accepted belief is that managers\nand investors will do better by focusing on the net present, future or annuity value of after-tax cash flows rather than\nfocusing on profits as defined by accounting rules and government regulations.\n\nIt will eventually be necessary to consider how taxes and accounting rules affect cash flows and to understand how\nchanges in tax laws and accounting can be used to promote different types of projects. For now, however, we keep\nour focus on cash flows without worrying about taxes. But we do have to worry about risk, and the easiest way to\nunderstand why is to consider the effect of borrowing money on the chances for a project's success, as demonstrated\nin the next section.\n\nLeveraging and Risk\n\nBorrowing the funds needed for an investment will reduce the initial investment required from the owner and\npotentially increase the expected return on the investment, but also increase the risk of the project. Because of the\nhigher risk associated with the project, a higher discount rate will have to be used.\n\nConsider the case from the previous section in which a project's cash flow has been transformed into the equivalent\ncash flows represented by an investment of I at time 0 and annual profits A that are received at the end of every year\nthereafter. If all the investment funds are provided by the owner of the project, then the owner's return on investment\nwill be A/I. If the owner borrows a portion of the investment, then two things happen: the owner's investment declines\nby the amount borrowed, and the annual profit declines by the amount paid in interest. The owner's return on\ninvestment will now be:\n\n(Eq. 1)\nOwner's ROI = (A - loan interest)/(I - loan principal)\n\nFigure 1 illustrates what would happen in a situation where the initial annual return A is $20 million on an investment\nI of $100 million. The y-axis on this chart should be interpreted as millions of dollars for income and debt payments,\nbut for ROI it should be read as the annual %. The chart on the left shows the initial situation in which all of the\ninvestment is provided by the owner; the annual income is $20 million, there is no interest payment on the debt, and\nthe ROI is 20% (A/I = $20 million/$100 million).\n\nThe chart on the right shows what happens if the owner only provides half of the investment and borrows the other\n$50 million at an interest rate of 10%. In this case, the annual income remains unchanged at $20 million, but there is\nan interest payment of $5 million. The owner's ROI jumps to 30%, as the net income to the owner after paying the\ninterest is $15 million, which is 30% of the owner's investment.\n\nFigure 1 Benefits of Leveraging: debt financing increases expected\nreturns if the interest rate is lower than the non-leveraged ROI\nDebt Financing Increases the\nExpected Return of the Project if the\nInterest Rate is lower than the ROI\nIncome\nDebt Payment\nROI\n-10\nBorrow half the cost, pay\nonly 25% of income for i\n\nBorrowing money will increase the owner's ROI so long as the interest rate is lower than the return on the original\nproject. The process of borrowing money in order to increase the amount that can be invested is called leveraging.\nLeveraging may increase or decrease the profitability of the project. Since infrastructure projects generally require\nvery substantial investments, most such projects are highly leveraged. Minimizing interest costs becomes a major\nconcern in such projects.\n\nWhether leveraging is undertaken in order to increase ROI or simply to enable the project to be constructed, leveraging\nwill increase risks because of the possibility of a default on interest payments. Figure 2 shows why this is so. As\nsuggested by the chart on the left, cash flows may vary from year to year. In this situation, annual profits range\nbetween $5 million and $70 million. In the unleveraged situation, smaller annual profits simply reduce the profitability\nfor that year, and the owner still enjoys positive cash flow. In the chart on the right, it is assumed that the project is\nvery highly leveraged, requiring interest payments of $35 million per year. As a result, the cash flows in some years\nare insufficient to cover the interest payments, and the owner must use other sources of funds to make the interest\npayments and avoid bankruptcy.\n\nThe greater the uncertainty in predicting future cash flows, the greater the risks from leveraging. Leveraging works\nbest in situations where there is a stable source of revenue, so that there is little risk that interest expenses will exceed\nactual cash flows. A project whose financing is heavily leveraged will be riskier than if it had little or no debt, and\ninvestors will therefore discount projected cash flows using a higher discount rate.\n\nFigure 2 Risks of Debt Financing: leveraging increases risks because\nprincipal and interest payments must be paid when due\nDebt Financing Increases Risks of a\nProjects, Because Principal & Interest\nMust be Paid When Due\nTime\nAnnual Income\nTime\n-60\n-40\n-20\nAnnual Income or Payment\nIncome\nDebt Payment\nNet Income\n\nFactors Affecting the Discount Rate\n\nMinimum Attractive Rate of Return (MARR)\n\nThe discount rate reflects the time value of money to a particular individual or organization. Future cash flows must\nbe discounted because of at least three factors.\n\n-\nOpportunity cost: the opportunity cost represents the potential financial benefits that must be foregone once\na decision is made to invest in a particular project. Instead of investing in a particular project, individuals\nand companies could invest in other projects, in stocks and bonds, in real estate or in other ventures. If they\nhave borrowed money, they could pay off their debt. If they have sold stocks to the public, they could buy\nback some of the stocks.\n-\nInflation: inflation is likely to erode the purchasing power of money received in the future. As a result, the\nsame amount of money would purchase less in the future than it would today.\n-\nRisk: the money that is anticipated to be received sometime in the future may or may not materialize.\n\nThese factors overlap to some extent, as the opportunity cost depends to some extent on expectations concerning\ninflation and risk. Also, each of these factors will be treated differently by those promoting a project and those\ninvesting in a project. Nevertheless, both promoters and investors are likely to have a minimum attractive rate of\nreturn (MARR) as they contemplate undertaking or investing in a project. The MARR represents the rate of return\nthat promoters or investors believe that they could achieve via other investments with similar perceived risks.\nDiscounting cash flows using the MARR as the discount rate will indicate whether or not the proposed project is as\nattractive as pursuing the other options that are available. Promoters and potential investors have different investment\noptions and they have different perceptions of the risks associated with a particular project. Therefore the MARR\nused by those proposing a project is likely to be different from the MARR used by those who are asked to invest in\nthe project. The differences are worth discussing in further detail.\n\nMARR for Investors\n\nPotential investors have quite a different perspective from those proposing a project. They are not necessarily\nconcerned very much or at all with the objectives of the project, as they are primarily interested in maximizing their\nfinancial returns. They probably do not understand nearly as much about the technologies, locations, opportunities,\nor possibilities as do the promoters of a project - and the investors are apt to be leery of promoters who perhaps have\nreasons to oversell their project proposals.\n\nInvestors have numerous investment opportunities, and they have access to many qualified investment analysts who\nrate the financial attractiveness of many of those investment opportunities. They are likely to have a very good\nunderstanding of the financial markets, and they will have their own track record with respect to investing in different\nsectors and in different types of securities.\n\nIn general, investors can seek higher returns by investing in riskier endeavors, as illustrated in Figure 3. Savings\naccounts insured by the U.S. government and bonds issued by the U.S. government may be viewed as a risk-free\ninvestment, and they may offer an interest rate of 5% or less. Riskier bonds will require higher interest rates in order\nto attract investors. The risk that a bond will default can be estimated by analyzing the finances of the company or\ngovernment agency issuing the bonds. Companies such as Moody's rate bonds with respect to their credit-worthiness;\nthe best bonds are rated as AAA, then AA, B, etc. Bonds with lower ratings require higher interest rates because the\nprobability of default is greater; bonds with very low ratings may be deemed unsuitable as investments for some very\nconservative pension funds or mutual funds. Bond prices reflect the discounted value of the stream of interest\npayments plus the discounted value of the ultimate redemption of the face value of the bond. The lower the credit\nrating, the more the interest and the ultimate redemption of the bond will be discounted. Since bonds commonly are\nsold in standard denominations (e.g. $1,000), the interest rate must be increased for riskier bonds to justify the sales\nprice of $1,000.\n\nFigure 3 Risk vs. Expected Return: the higher the perceived risk,\nthe higher the return that will be necessary to attract investors\nWhat is an Appropriate Discount Rate?\nRisk vs. Expected Return\nGov. Bond\nAAA Bonds\nB Bonds\nBlue Chips\nGrowth Stocks\nEmerg. Markets\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n\nFigure 3 shows stocks as having a higher expected return than B-rated bonds. This makes sense, because the interest\nmust be paid on the bonds before any cash is available to the stockholders. \"Blue Chips\" are stocks in the largest,\nmost well-known, and very financially stable and attractive companies. Blue Chips have an excellent history of good\nfinancial performance, and they therefore are viewed as having relatively low risk. The value of Blue Chip stocks is\nlargely dependent upon a continuation of past performance rather than anticipation of future improvement. Growth\nstocks are issued by companies that anticipate rapid growth in earnings; the value of the stocks is based more on hope\n\nfor the future rather than continuation of the past. Since the earnings are expected, not proven, investors discount\nfuture cash flows more heavily than they discount Blue Chip cash flows. Even higher discounts will be applied to\ncash flows projected by companies involved with new technologies or companies that do substantial business in\nregions of the world where financial markets are relatively undeveloped. The opportunities may well be much greater\nin such markets, but the risks are also much higher.\n\nThe risk-return curve plotted above in Figure 3 is determined by market forces and economic conditions. The shape\nof the curve is affected by the state of the economy, government policy concerning interest rates, government debt\nlevels, the number of new offerings of stocks and bonds, political uncertainty in various regions around the world,\npublic perceptions concerning new technologies, wars, and other factors. The discount rates implied by the risk-return\ncurve can be interpreted as resulting from the sum of three factors:\n\n-\nThe real return available on risk-free investments\n-\nThe expected rate of inflation\n-\nA risk premium that reflects investors' collective views concerning the riskiness of the company, including\njudgments concerning the company's financial situation, the outlook for the entire industry, and the social\nand political conditions in the country or countries where the company is located or where the company's\nproducts are sold.\n\nEach of these factors is used to discount the current value of future earnings. For example, given the risk free return\n(rf), the annual risk premium, and the inflation rate (inf), the present worth of the cash flow CF in month N would be:\n\n(Eq. 2)\nPresent worth of CF(N) = CF(N)/((1+rf)N(1+risk)N(1+inf)N)\n\nIf each of the three factors is small, then\n\n(Eq. 3)\nPresent worth of CF(N) ~ CF(N)/(1 + rf + risk + inf)N\n\nThe discount rate, in this case, would be (rf + risk + inf).\n\nIt is important to understand what the chart in Figure 3 does show and what it does not show. It does show that\ninvestors will discount future cash flows much more severely if they believe that there is a lot of risk associated with\na project. It does not show that investments in riskier projects will make more money. It does show that reducing\nrisks allows a developer or a company to raise more money today based upon its projected cash flows for tomorrow.\n\nIt is even more important to understand that the above chart represents the market's evaluation of risks and investment\nopportunities. This is not the same as the owner's or developer's assessment of opportunities. Each individual and\neach company has their own Minimal Acceptable Rate of Return (MARR) and their own preferences for risk and\nreturn. Their MARR is based upon their opportunities, perceptions of their risks, and their preferences for risk and\nreturn. They will discount projections of future cash flows in their projects using their MARR for projects they deem\nto have similar risks. Because of their own experience or knowledge or ignorance, they may well believe that a project\ncan be completed as planned and that it will indeed achieve the anticipated cash flows. Hence, they may see projects\nas being less risky (and therefore a better alternative) than the same projects would be viewed by the market. They\nwill therefore go to rather great lengths to convince potential investors that the project is feasible and that the risks are\nnot as great as the investors might fear.\n\nMARR for Owners and Promoters\n\nProject owners and promoters have a much different perspective than investors. The promoters may be a developer,\na company, or an agency promoting a particular project; there may be a \"champion\" who has long been advocating\nthe project and seeking political and financial support from many agencies, organizations, and companies. The\npromoters are seeking to achieve various benefits from the project, some of which may be financial, some of which\n\nmay be economic and quantifiable as monetary benefits, and some of which may be social or environmental or other\nbenefits that are difficult to quantify. They understand that they need to finance the project, i.e. come up with the cash\nnecessary to pay for the investment and the continuing expenses of the project. Presumably they believe that the\nproject is worth doing, that it is a good way to achieve the benefits that are sought, and that it has a reasonable chance\nof success. They will have considered similar projects and perhaps they may have already completed similar projects.\nThey likely have consulted experts regarding the feasibility of the construction, the demand for the project and the\nrisks associated with the proposed project. They also have a good idea of their own opportunity costs, based upon\ntheir experience and their investment options. They presumably do not expect their next project to be their best\nproject ever, but they do expect to achieve returns similar to what they have achieved in the past and to what they\nbelieve they could achieve in other projects.\n\nIf the promoters have sufficient funds to construct and operate the project, then they can do pretty much what they\nwant to do. If they need to raise money for the project, then they have additional financial concerns. If they borrow\nmoney, they will worry about the interest rates they will have to pay. If they need to sell stock, they will worry about\nhow what price their stock will command in the market and what proportion of the ownership must be transferred to\nthe new stockholders. Their MARR must be greater than their cost of capital and it must be greater than what they\nearn in other endeavors.\n\nThe cost of capital is an important factor for companies. Many companies raise money by selling bonds or selling\nstock. The cost of capital is lower for bonds than for stocks, as described in the previous section. For bonds, the\ncost of capital is the interest rate that is paid. For stocks, the cost of capital can be estimated as the historical returns\nto the owners of the stock. The annual return for a stock can be calculated as follows:\n\n(Eq. 4)\nAnnual return = (Final Value - Initial Value + Dividends)/Initial Value\n\nFor example, consider a stock that was valued at $100/share on January 1st, paid a $2 dividend on December 31st and\nhad a value of $110 on January 1st of the following year. The stock increased in value by 10% and the dividend was\n2% of the initial value, so the total return was 12%. The average historical returns for a stock can be used when\nestimating the cost of capital for that company.\n\nA share of stock represents ownership in the company, which means that stockholders have \"equity\" in the company.\nThe weighted average cost of capital depends on the relative amounts of debt and equity in the company and can be\ncalculated as follows.\n\n(Eq. 5)\nWACC = %D (average interest on debt) + % E (average return on equity)\n\nWhere\n\n%D = Debt as percent of total value of debt plus stock\n\n%E = Equity as percent of total value of debt plus stock\n\nFor example, we can calculate the weighted average cost of capital for a company whose ratio of debt to equity is 3::2,\nwhose average interest rate on debt is 8%, and whose historical returns to equity have been 16%. Substituting these\nvalues in Equation 6 shows that the company's average cost of capital is 11.2%:\n\n(Eq. 6)\nWACC = 60% debt (8% interest on debt) + 40% equity (16% return on equity)\n\n= .6 (8%) + .4 (16%) = 4.8% +6.4% = 11.2%\n\nAs discussed above, a company may reduce its credit rating and increase the risk of bankruptcy if it increases its\nproportion of debt. If a company increases the ratio of debt to equity, it will eventually encounter higher interest rates\n\nand difficulties in selling bonds. To maintain their credit ratings, many companies will endeavor to maintain a constant\nratio of debt to equity. If this ratio is constant, then the WACC represents what it costs (or has cost) the company to\nraise capital for new projects. Over time, as the debt/equity ratio and market conditions change, the cost of capital\nwill also change.\n\nThe analysis of the cost of capital can be made much more complicated. Instead of the weighted average cost of\ncapital over the past year or past five years, a company will likely be interested in its current cost of capital. In\nregulatory affairs and legal cases, lawyers and experts will debate projected cash flows and discount rates. In Wall\nStreet or other financial centers, analysts will be trying to figure out the true values of stock prices, which presumably\nreflect the projected cash flows for the company, the discount rate applied to those cash flows, and the number of\nshares outstanding. Company financial officers present their projections of cash flows to financial analysts, and the\nfinancial analysts make recommendations to their clients as to whether the stock should be bought, sold, or held. The\nfinancial analysts may make their own judgments regarding future cash flows of the company, and they may select a\ndiscount rate based upon their perceptions of risk. Their judgments will be critical in determining share prices as well\nas the interest rates the company will have to pay on future sales of bonds.\n\nThe benefit to a company in issuing stock instead of bonds is that there is no requirement to issue dividends, which is\nvery helpful during unprofitable periods. If a company defaults on interest payments on bonds, it can be forced into\nbankruptcy, but if it decides not to issue dividends, there is no such risk. The negative aspect of selling stock is that\nthe sales price may reflect investors' application of very high discount rates to the company's projection of future cash\nflows. As a result, the current owners may give up more of the company (and its future earnings) than they want to if\nthey try to sell more shares of stock.\n\nIt is important to emphasize again and again that perceptions of risk and choices of discount rates will be different for\nthe different parties involved in a project. For example, suppose a group of engineers and entrepreneurs has created\na company that is trying to raise $100 million for constructing what they believe to be a very lucrative project in a\ndeveloping country. The company has done extensive research concerning construction costs, operating cost, and\npotential revenues. While they recognize that there are some risks related to regional economic conditions, they are\nconfident that their proposal can be constructed on time and on budget and that it will attract high demand almost\nimmediately. They have prepared a prospectus in which they describe the project in great detail, and they anticipate\nannual profits to reach $20 million per year for at least 30 years. Using a discount rate of 10%, they estimated the net\npresent value of the revenue stream to be $200 million as of the time the project begins operations, which is far greater\nthan the construction cost. They will have no income for several years while the project is being constructed, so they\nhope to raise the $100 million from a combination of low-interest loans and sale of stock to get started. Almost\nimmediately, they discover that they would have to pay 12% interest for a construction loan of no more than $20\nmillion; by the time construction was completed, they estimated they would have to pay $5 million in interest. Then\nthey approached several potential investors to see if would be feasible to sell stock in their company to raise the funds\nnecessary to cover the remaining $80 million of construction costs plus the $5 million in interest. They indeed found\ninvestors interested in infrastructure projects in this country - but those investors were discounting cash flows by 25%\nor more when they evaluated such projects. Hence, for those investors, the cash flows of $20 million per year were\nworth only $80 million (estimated as the equivalent present value of an annuity for an indefinite period = $20 million\nper year/(0.25) = $80 million). Thus, to these investors, the returns from the proposed project were much less than\ntheir MARR, so that they would not be willing to pay enough for the stock for the developers to finance their project\neven if they purchased 100% of the company. The project therefore would likely collapse, because it would be\nimpossible to raise sufficient funds to get started.\n\nMARR for Large Companies\n\nA large company's minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) will never be less than its weighted average cost of\ncapital (WACC), because it can always buy back its stock and bonds if it has an excess of cash and no suitable\ninvestments. Since the WACC reflects market valuations of its stock and bonds, the WACC and therefore the MARR\n\nwill be affected by macro-economic factors such as inflation and recessions as well as by the market's perception of\nrisks associated with the company and the industry.\n\nThe company's MARR must also take into consideration the company's opportunities for investments. Investments\nin the company may be desirable in order to expand capacity, increase efficiency, support moves into new types of\nbusiness, or to improve safety. Company officials will have many competing internal requests for capital, and they\nwill have (or should have) an excellent perspective concerning the potential benefits for these competing projects. A\ncompany may also consider broader investments. It can invest in the financial markets, just like any investor, or it\ncould attempt to buy or merge with other companies.\n\nIn a completely predictable world, a company perhaps would be able to invest in any and all projects with a return\ngreater than its WACC. After all, if a company can raise money by selling stocks and bonds at an average cost of, say\n11%, then it can increase its profits by investing in all projects with an expected return greater than 11%. If so, then\nthe MARR for this company would be the WACC.\n\nIn actual practice, however, the company is faced with many uncertainties. The projections of cash flows are based\nupon numerous assumptions, and there is in fact a potential distribution of cash flows associated with each project.\nThe expected return may be greater than 11%, but there may be a good chance of earning less or even substantially\nless than 11%. The more highly leveraged the company becomes, the greater the potential that it will be unable to\ncover its interest payments. The company may not be willing to risk losing money, and therefore may not wish to\ninvest in projects unless they are very sure that the projects will have a return greater and perhaps substantially greater\nthan its WACC. This kind of financial discipline will be imposed at three levels:\n\n-\nThe Chief Financial Officer will scrutinize proposals and impose criteria for ranking and selecting projects,\ntaking into account the need to maintain a debt/equity ratio that is acceptable to investors\n-\nThe Board of Directors may limit the total capital budget for the company in order to limit the overall risks\nassociated with the company\n-\nThe capital markets may decide that a company is a credit risk, which means that someone will issue a report\nor a study or a credit ranking that reflects poorly on the company. Companies, countries or agencies with a\npoor credit rating will have to pay higher interest on any future bonds that they issue and they will probably\nsee a reduction in their stock prices or more difficulty in raising money for their projects.\n\nThus, in practice, a company will typically be unable to invest in all of the potentially profitable projects. Instead, it\nis likely to invest in the most profitable projects, which means that it will set its MARR (often called a \"hurdle rate\")\nwell above its average cost of capital.\n\nMARR for State, Local, and Federal Governments\n\nGovernments are often able to sell bonds at very low interest rates, so it may appear that the cost of capital for a public\nagency is very low. However, the low rates reflect in part the ability of governments to raise money by taxation. The\nactual cost of capital reflects not only the interest costs on public bonds but also the opportunity cost associated with\ntaxation. What could the public have otherwise done with the money they paid in taxes? When economists consider\nthis question, they come up with a higher cost of capital and therefore a higher discount rate or MARR for public\nprojects.\n\nConsider a taxpayer who has a minimum acceptable rate of return of 12%. This individual or business would be\nunwilling to invest in a scheme that offered less than 12% profit. The taxpayer would not keep all of the profits, as\nany applicable federal, state, or local taxes would have to be paid. If those taxes amounted to a third of the profits,\nthen the minimum acceptable after-tax profit for the taxpayer would be 8% of the investment. A taxpayer concerned\nwith efficiency in government might feel that government funded projects should be subjected to the same kind of\ntest: the government should not invest in projects unless they also provide an after-tax benefit of 8%. Since\ngovernments do not pay taxes, this taxpayer might conclude that the government should use a minimum acceptable\n\nrate of return of 8% for projects funded by general tax revenues. The taxpayer might prefer projects to have a financial\nreturn of 8%, but perhaps would be willing to include clearly documented economic benefits received by society.\n\nThere is certainly some credibility to the argument that governments should not use tax revenues for projects with\nonly modest benefits if the same money could have been better used by the taxpayers themselves. Deciding what rate\nof return is required is a matter of policy more than logic. In the United States, the General Accountability Office\nfrom time to time issues guidelines for the discount rates that should be used for public projects. These rates have\nrecently been 7-8%, which is consistent with the logic expressed above. Given the many difficulties in measuring and\nmonetarizing the public costs and benefits of a project, the choice of a discount rate is just one of many analytical\nassumptions that must be considered in evaluating a public project.\n\nMARR for Special Government Agencies\n\nGovernments sometimes create special independent agencies that are authorized to raise money by selling bonds.\nThese bonds are backed not by taxation, but by the financial credit of the agency. For these agencies, the cost of\ncapital really is the interest rates that they must pay on their bonds. These agencies are therefore able to invest in\nprojects with low financial returns - presumably justified by the broader socio-economic benefits provided by the\nagency. Examples would include port authorities, turnpike authorities, and housing authorities.\n\nChoosing a Discount Rates: Examples\n\nThis section presents several examples that illustrate the logic behind the choice of a discount rate. Note that the\nchoice is heavily dependent upon the perspective of the individual or organization that is making the choice. In some\nsituations, there may be no clear answer, and there is usually no precise answer.\n\nDetermining the Interest Rate for Corporate Bonds\n\nAs the VP Finance for Acme Construction, you have been asked to estimate the interest rates on bonds that your\ncompany plans to sell in order to finance the construction of a new toll bridge. Long-term US Treasury Bonds\ncurrently pay just under 5% interest, and you know that investors usually consider these to be nearly risk-free\ninvestments. You expect that the rate of inflation (currently 2%) will increase to 3% by the time that your company\nis ready to sell the bonds. You expect that your company's bonds will continue to have a risk premium of 2% relative\nto US Treasury bonds. What interest rate should you plan to pay on these bonds?\n\nThis question addresses the interest rates that investors will require to invest in your project. From a financial analyst's\nperspective, the interest rate will be determined by the market. As seen in section 8.3, the market requires higher\nreturns for riskier securities (see the figure that illustrates a risk/return curve). Discount rates for each type of security\nwill equal the sum of three factors:\n\n-\nthe interest rate on a risk-free, inflation-free investment (i.e. the basic time value of money)\n-\nthe inflation rate\n-\na risk premium\n\nHere, we have 5% interest on US Treasury bonds, which includes inflation, but is presumed to be risk free. We expect\ninflation to increase by 1%. And the risk premium will be 2%. Therefore we expect the rate to be 5%+1%+2% = 8%\n\nChoosing a Discount Rate Based Upon a Firm's Cost of Capital\n\nBrothers K, a construction firm specializing in prison security, borrows money at 6%; its stock is priced by the market\nto provide a 12% return. The company's debt/equity ratio is currently 2. What discount rate should the company use\nto evaluate new projects so as to at least cover its weighted average cost of capital?\n\nWe know that the company's MARR should be at least as great as the weighted average cost of capital. We are given\nno further information about the company, except that it is an established firm with prior projects and an ability to\nraise money by borrowing or by selling stock. The debt/equity ratio of 2 means that loans account for 2/3 of the\nmarket valuation of the company, while stocks account for 1/3 of the market valuation. The weighted average cost of\ncapital will be 2/3(6%) plus 1/3(12%) = 8%. It would be possible to argue for a higher rate based upon the likelihood\nthat the MARR will be above, or even significantly above the WACC.\n\nChoosing a Discount Rate for a City\n\nCities must justify investment in infrastructure by comparing the present worth of net benefits over the life of the\nproject to the present worth of the construction costs. Cities raise money through income tax, property tax, or the sale\nof bonds. Interest paid on municipal bonds is about 4%, which is lower than the interest rates that private companies\npay on their bonds (about 6%) and much lower than the returns required to sell stock (10% or more). What discount\nrate should the city use in evaluating the present worth of their investments?\n\nA city's discount rate must be greater than the interest it pays on bonds (4%) because it raises money from taxpayers\n- individuals and companies - who have other options. The cost of capital for taxpayers will reflect some mixture of\ndebt and equity financing, i.e. about 8% if the Brothers K firm in the previous example is typical. As noted above,\nthe General Accountability Office requires the U.S. federal government to use something like 7-8% for discounting\nrelated to public investments.\n\nChoosing a Discount Rate Based Upon a Firm's Investment Options\n\nEarp Enterprises is a developer in Arizona that specializes in building relatively inexpensive, but functional corrals\nwhich they call \"OK Corrals\". Because of the company's use of advanced planning techniques and standardized\ncomponents, it has consistently been able to make a return of 14-18% on its projects. The company's weighted average\ncost of capital is 10%, and it is a highly profitable company. A recent PhD from MIT, Flora Holliday, would like Mr.\nEarp to invest in a second home development focused on a new marina at Lake Powell. She has prepared a business\nplan that shows the cash flows that she expects from this venture, which she calls \"Holliday Docks\". What discount\nrate should Earp Enterprises use to determine whether or not to shoot down this proposal?\n\nEarp's MARR must be greater than or equal to his cost of capital, which is 10%. If capital is unlimited, then any\nproject that earns the cost of capital will be acceptable. On the other hand, capital probably is not unlimited and the\nquestion certainly implies that Earp has done very well on his prior projects. Since Earp has won many financial\nvictories at his OK Corrals, he seems to have opportunities to make 14-18% \"consistently\". Hence, his MARR should\nreflect the lucrative potential for continued investment in OK Corrals and be higher than the WACC, perhaps 14-15%.\n\nDividing Up the Cash Flows of a Major Project\n\nIt is important to understand that the various players involved in a major project will have markedly different cash\nflows, different risks to worry about, and different MARRs. Consider a case where a developer has secured a line of\ncredit from Bank One for constructing a building. The bank will pay all the construction costs and charge the owner\ninterest; no payments will be made on the loan until the project is completed, at which time loan payments will begin.\nThe construction loan is likely to have a high interest rate, since there are risks related to the feasibility, time, and cost\nof construction. The owner plans to refinance the loan with Bank Two when the building is completed at the end of\n\nyear 3. Refinancing should provide a lower interest rate because the building will in fact be completed and there will\n(hopefully) be tenants who are paying on long-term leases. If all goes well, the new loan will cover the construction\nloan and the monthly loan payments plus operating costs will be less than the revenue from the tenants.\n\nThe cash flows for the three major players will be as follows:\n\n-\nBank One - pays all construction costs as they are incurred over the three years of construction; receives\nreimbursement plus interest when the loan is refinanced at the end of year 3.\n-\nBank Two - gives the owner an amount large enough to pay off the construction loan at the end of year 3;\nreceives monthly payments of principal and interest for the life of the mortgage.\n-\nOwner - pays nothing during construction period, since all of those costs are covered by Bank One; receives\na large amount from Bank Two at the end of 3 years but immediately uses that money to pay off the loan\nfrom Bank One; collects lease payments, pays for operations, and makes loan payments to Bank Two over\nthe life of the loan.\n\nBank One has completed its role by the end of year 3. Bank Two just starts its role at that time. The owner, if all goes\nwell, doesn't have to put up his own money to construct the building, and then has sufficient cash flow to cover the\nmortgage payments. Bank One prefers to earn a high rate of interest rather than to hold on to its cash; the owner\nprefers to have the cash as needed. Bank Two is willing to accept lower interest, but is also creating a long-term\nannuity for itself. The owner would rather pay the interest on a long-term loan than pay for the building when it is\nconstructed.\n\nWe could go into more detail and consider such things as the cash flow for the construction firms and suppliers or the\npossibility of selling the building upon completion. Each actor will have different perspectives on whether or not this\nis a good project, and each will have a different level of exposure to the risks that might be associated with the project.\n\nSummary\n\nDiscounting is a mechanism for converting an arbitrary stream of cash flows into a present value, a future value, or an\nannuity. Three main factors must be considered in choosing a reasonable discount rate:\n\n-\nInvestment opportunities: what alternative opportunities are available for investment?\n-\nRisk: is the proposed project more or less risky than the other options?\n-\nInflation: how much will inflation reduce the future purchasing power of of our money?\n\nDiscount rates and the notion of a \"Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return\" (MARR) are very important and potentially\nvery confusing topics. The confusion results because of the differences in perspective among the various actors\ninvolved in designing, building, and financing a project.\n\nDevelopers and entrepreneurs are generally in the position of raising money for constructing projects that they believe\nto be justifiable in terms of their future benefits. Since they lack the funds to build these projects, they must convince\nothers to invest in them, possibly by citing the importance of the project, but more likely by demonstrating the potential\nprofitability of the investment. Developers have various strategies for raising funds for their projects, including\nborrowing money from a bank, selling bonds, and selling stock.\n\nInvestors have a much different perspective than developers. Developers are thinking of receiving rents or tolls or\noperating profits, which they hope will be enough to cover the mortgage or interest payments or to justify a high price\nfor their stock. For them, the cost of money is similar to the cost of energy or labor, and their main concern is about\nthe long-term success of their projects. For the bankers and other investors, the nature of the project is much less\nrelevant than the prospect of making money from mortgage payments, loan payments, bond-interest or rising values\nfor the stock they have purchased.\n\nFinancial markets exist for stocks, bonds, mortgages, mutual funds, and other types of financial assets. The price of\nthese financial assets depends upon the market, i.e. upon the price that a willing seller will accept from a buyer. The\nvalue of these assets (to an investor or a securities analyst) is based upon a projection of cash flows, an estimation of\nthe risks associated with these cash flows, and the availability and price of other assets with similar levels of risks.\nDifferent potential investors may view the cash flows, the risks, and the alternative opportunities quite differently,\nwhich is part of the reason why securities are continuously bought and sold.\n\nThe different perspectives of financial analysts, governments, independent government agencies, and private\ncompanies result in different ways of determining their MARRs. Financial analysts are not particularly concerned\nabout the merits of a company or a project; their job is to determine the risks associated with stocks, bonds or loans\nassociated with a company or a project. A company with good credit can easily raise capital to invest in bad projects;\na company with no past history may be unable to raise funds even for projects that may appear to the public to be\nhighly desirable.\n\nWhen local, state or federal government agencies discount the costs and benefits of proposed projects, their discount\nrate should reflect the average returns available to taxpayers, not the low interest rates on public bonds. However, if\na special public agency raises money by selling bonds rather than through taxation, then it can use the interest rate on\nthose bonds as its MARR.\n\nFor private companies, the MARR should be at least as great as their weighted average cost of capital, and it should\nbe at least as high as the rate of return achievable on alternative projects or on investments in the financial markets.\nIn practice, the financial risks associated with leveraging will generally result in an MARR well above the weighted\naverage cost of capital.\n\nIn any situation, the discount rate is a rather fuzzy number, so it will be wise to consider a range of discount rates\nwhen evaluating a project.\n\nIn major projects, it is usually necessary to raise funds for construction from banks (loans) or financial markets (stocks\nand bonds). An entrepreneur or a company presents estimates of costs and benefits to banks and investors, who then\nevaluate the risks and choose discount rates consistent with their own MARRs. If a commitment is made to pay the\nbanks before paying interest on bonds or dividends on stocks, then the banks' investments in the project are less risky\nthan the investments made by those buying stocks and bonds. If the project is being undertaken by a government\nagency or a large company, it may be possible to get a low interest rate for loans based upon the agency's or company's\ncredit rating rather than a rate based upon the riskiness of the project.\n\nIf you can reduce the perceived risks of your project, you can raise more money because investors will apply a lower\ndiscount rate to the same future benefits. In particular, a project that has been completed or that has very clear\ncommitments for cash flows (leases for a building; approved tolls for a highway; approved public subsidies) will have\nlower risks than a new project with uncertain time to completion and no guaranteed source of income.\n\n\"Leveraging\" is a term used when money is borrowed for your project and a pledge is made to a) repay the loan or b)\nturn the project over to the lender if loan payments are not made. Borrowing reduces the amount of their own money\nthat the owners must put into the project and allows a chance for a greater return on their investment, but also creates\ngreater financial risks.\n\nFinancial Assessment\nI will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.\n\nJ. Wellington Wimpy (Popeye's friend)\n\nIntroduction\n\nNo project is undertaken solely to make money, but money is a consideration in every project. Entrepreneurs are in\nthe game primarily to make a lot of money, even though the projects they contemplate are at some level aimed at\nsatisfying someone's needs or desires. Even if a project is contemplated solely for some marvelous cultural or\naesthetic benefit, it will still be necessary to pay the carpenters and buy the lumber. We therefore must be prepared\nto deal with money, to understand why someone would be willing to invest in a project, and to understand how\nentrepreneurs and investors think about projects and about money.\n\nOwners and entrepreneurs need funds up front in order to create their projects; they expect future profits to be sufficient\nto provide an attractive return on their investment. If they try to raise money from a bank or from investors, they must\nprepare a financial plan that shows how the project will generate sufficient cash flows to pay off the interest on the\nloans or bonds, while increasing the value of the company for stockholders. When trying to raise money, what the\nowners and entrepreneurs think the project is worth does not necessarily matter very much. What matters is what the\nbankers and other potential investors think the project is worth. If they perceive the project to be very risky, they will\nuse a higher discount rate. If their portion of the project can be made less risky, then they will use a lower discount\nrate and be willing to invest more in the project. It is conceivable that projects that appear very profitable to the\nproponents may appear to be too risky to investors, who will therefore be unwilling to provide the funds needed.\n\nIn general, a project must satisfy three criteria to be worth pursuing:\n\n-\nThe benefits expected from the project must be greater than its costs.\n-\nThe project must be viewed as a good way to achieve these benefits, because there may be engineering or\ninstitutional alternatives that are as good or better.\n-\nThere must not be better ways to use the resources that would be devoted to this project; maybe it would be\nbetter to invest in housing than in transportation.\n\nBasic methods of engineering economics can be used to assess competing projects based upon analysis of their\nprojected cash flows and any economic impacts that can be expressed in monetary terms.\n\nMaximizing Net Present Value\n\nThe net present value (NPV) of a project is the difference between the present value of the net benefits over the life\nof the project and the present value of the investment. The NPV of a project will depend upon the costs and benefits\nthat are considered, the project life, and the discount rate. In general, the objective will be to maximize the net present\nvalue when evaluating alternative projects.\n\nIf the NPV is positive, then any equivalent annuity and any equivalent future worth will also be positive. If the NPV\nof one option is better than the NPV of another project, then any equivalent annuity A or future value FV will also be\nbetter for this option. Whichever measure is used, the ranking of any options will be the same. Depending upon the\nsituation, it may make sense to focus on future worth or annuities rather than NPV, as shown by the following\nexamples:\n\na.\nPlanning for a major future event, such as replacing a bridge: the basic question is how much to allocate\neach year to a sinking fund so that the future value of that fund will be sufficient to pay for the bridge\nreplacement.\nb. Incorporating equipment costs in operating budgets: operating budgets can easily include weekly or monthly\nexpenses. Converting the purchase price into an equivalent weekly or monthly cost is therefore a convenient\nway to allocate costs of equipment.\nc.\nConstruction of an office building: the critical time is likely to be the completion of construction, so it will\nbe useful to estimate the future value of construction costs as of that time. It will then be useful to convert\nthe FV of the construction cost into an annuity that could be used compared to anticipated annual rent\npayments and maintenance costs.\nd. Investments aimed at improving the environment, where the benefits may be measurable but not in monetary\nterms. If it is not possible to monetarize the benefits, then it will be impossible or meaningless to talk about\nthe NPV of such benefits. Instead, convert the investment cost into an equivalent annuity over the life of the\nproject. That way, the comparison of alternatives can be based upon cost effectiveness by comparing the\nexpected annual benefits of each alternative to its annual cost.\n\nNPV analysis is widely used because it can translate the cash flows of complex projects into equivalent amounts that\nare very easy to understand and to compare, assuming that a reasonable discount rate is used and acknowledging the\nfact that different parties involved in a project may have different discount rates.\n\nThe choice of a discount rate will be extremely important in determining what kinds of projects are most appealing.\nIf a very high discount rates is used, then the NPV will be based primarily upon what happens in the first 5-20 years\nof a project. Small projects with immediate benefits will look better with a higher discount rate, whereas large projects\nwith benefits that extend far into the future may fare poorly. If a very low discount rate is used, the opposite will be\ntrue: future costs and benefits will be much more heavily weighted.\n\nIn planning for public projects, use of a low discount rate may promote undertaking very large-scale projects while\nignoring very important current needs. On the other hand, use of a very high discount rate may prevent a company or\na country from ever undertaking large-scale projects.\n\nImportance of Project Life\n\nProjects need to be evaluated over a reasonable project life. Several factors enter into the choice of a \"reasonable\"\nlife:\n\n-\nThe economic life of the project: the period of time for which the project is expected to be in use.\n-\nThe period of time for which discounted cash flows are relevant to the analysis.\n-\nKnowledge concerning any dramatic costs or benefits that might be expected in the distant future.\n\nThe economic life of a project can be much less than the physical life of the structures that are constructed. If a\nrailroad is built to a mine, the railroad might be expected to last indefinitely so long as it is maintained properly. The\nfacilities at the mine may also be constructed to standards that would ensure a life of 30-50 years. However, the ore\nmay be gone after just 20 years, so that the economic life of both the railroad and the mine would be 20 years.\n\nUnless very low discount rates are used, a 20 to 50 year life is usually sufficient for analysis. Because of discounting,\nthe costs and benefits from more distant years will not add much to the NPV, so it will not be necessary to include\nthem in the calculations.\n\nIgnoring the out-years has been viewed by some as something very bad, as it means that the analysis would be ignoring\nthe impacts of current decisions on unborn generations. Some have called for the use of a zero-discount rate so that\nthe needs of future generations would be considered properly. In a financial analysis, however, it is foolish to talk of\na zero-discount rate since in fact investors and the financial markets that provide the funding for projects do discount\n\ncash flows - and the amount of money that can be raised for projects depends upon their discount rates. Potential\nbenefits that occur in the far distant future will not attract additional funding from the markets.\n\nOf course there may be some merit to the argument that current projects may be damaging the environment, creating\nhazards or promoting serious financial problems in ways that will not be apparent for 20 or more years. If a 20-year\nlife is used, then such problems may conveniently be overlooked. This problem can be dealt with by requiring\nadditional considerations in the choice of the time period:\n\n-\nAre benefits expected to continue to exceed costs for an indefinitely long period?\n-\nWill the project need to be decommissioned at the end of its useful life, and is the cost of that\ndecommissioning included at the end of the assumed project life?\n-\nAre there potential catastrophic consequences that could be caused by the project beyond what is considered\nwithin the chosen period for the analysis?\n-\nAre there extraordinary costs or benefits that can be expected after the proposed project life?\n\nFor projects where nothing unusual is expected in the distant future, the use of a 20-50 year project life will be long\nenough to capture the relevant costs and benefits associated with a project. For discount rates of 5% or more, the out-\nyears will contribute very little to the analysis, and it will be rather meaningless to make projections further into the\nfuture. If the economic life of the project is less than 20 years, then a shorter life should be used. If there is reason to\nexpect extraordinary costs or benefits that would be apparent only after a period of 20-50 years, then the project life\nshould of course be extended. In normal circumstances, using a discount rate and limiting the life of the project should\nnot be seen as somehow damaging to future generations - it is simply reflecting the reality of money and the principle\nof equivalence.\n\nDoes Discounting Ignore Future Catastrophes?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to define what is meant by a catastrophe and what the costs of a catastrophe might\nbe. To provide some perspective, we can look at the more dismal side of history. There have been numerous instances\nwhere natural disasters - earthquakes, hurricanes, or tsunamis - have killed tens of thousands of people, and there have\nbeen outbreaks of disease that have killed that many people in a single year in many different cities. In 2010, a\nhorrendously devastating earthquake destroyed much of Port Au Prince and other cities in Haiti, killed on the order\nof 100,000 people, and left more hundreds of thousands injured or homeless. In a few minutes, this earthquake caused\ndouble the amount of casualties suffered by US troops in all of this country's wars from Viet Nam to Afghanistan,\nand it caused 30 times the loss of human life suffered on 9/11. Wars with tens of thousands of casualties are\ncommonplace in history, and the world wars of the 20th century killed tens of millions. Epidemics, often initiated as\na result of natural disasters or warfare, can have the most devastating impacts on humanity. Millions of people died\nduring the Great Influenza of the early 1920s, and the Black Plague reduced the population of Europe by a third during\nthe 14th century. Diseases introduced by Europeans wiped out an even larger proportion of the native populations of\nNorth and South America during the 16th century.\n\nNatural disasters, warfare and disease will unfortunately continue to afflict humanity with catastrophic consequences\nfar into the future. Whether we are planners, engineers, political leaders, or private citizens, we should all be concerned\nwith ways that we could limit the frequency or the consequences of such catastrophes. If discounting really does make\nit possible to ignore catastrophic events far in the future, then that would be a severe flaw in the methodologies\ncommonly used in project evaluation. However, the financial, economic, and social costs of catastrophes can be so\nlarge that they cannot be ignored, even if the risks are small or far distant in time.\n\nFor example, consider the possibility of an epidemic that could break out in 50 years, taking the lives of 1 million\npeople. Suppose that steps could be taken today that would reduce the expected fatalities by 90% or defer the epidemic\nfor another 50 years. What would the benefits be, assuming a discount rate of 8%?\n\nWe can quantify the magnitude of such a disaster using an approach that various countries have adopted in managing\nrisks associated with accidents, infrastructure failure, and natural disasters. This approach evaluates the cost\neffectiveness of risk reduction strategies by comparing the costs of a strategy to the expected reduction in fatalities.\nIn the United States and in Europe, government safety regulations can be justified if the costs of improving safety are\nless than about $2.5 million per expected life saved.\n\nIf we use this approach, then an event that led to 1 million deaths would have a cost to society of 1 million deaths\nmultiplied by $2.5 million per fatality for a total of $2.5 trillion (i.e. $2.5 x 1012). This is an extremely large number.\nEven if this occurs 50 years in the future, the NPV of such a disaster is very large. With a discount rate of 8%, the\nNPV would be $2.5 trillion (1/1.08)50 = $2.5 trillion (0.02132) = $53 billion, which is not an insubstantial sum of\nmoney! Thus efforts that could reduce the expected fatalities by 90% would be worth nearly $50 billion today.\n\nIf the disaster occurred 100 years in the future rather than 50, then the $2.5 trillion would be further discounted by\nanother factor of 0.02131, and the NPV would be reduced from $53 to a bit more than $1 billion. Thus, reducing the\nmagnitude of this catastrophe by 90% or deferring the epidemic for another 50 years would each have a NPV of\napproximately $50 billion. Discounting does not allow us to ignore future catastrophes; it provides a rational way to\nassess the cost effectiveness of strategies for preventing, preparing for, or dealing with potential catastrophes.\n\nWhat would projects look like that had the effect of reducing the frequency or consequences of future disasters? For\nreducing the probability and severity of a pandemic, doctors can work to develop better drugs, public health officials\ncan work to eliminate unhealthy slums and improve water supplies, and governments can stockpile emergency\nsupplies of medicine and other supplies. To reduce the consequences of earthquakes and other natural disasters,\ngovernments can impose building codes that limit or require sturdier construction in dangerous areas, they can provide\nbetter communications and warning systems, and they can prepare for rapid response to natural disasters. A lot can\nbe done in each of these areas for $50 billion!\n\nReturn on Investment and Internal Rate of Return\n\nWhen reporting their financial results, companies produce reports that follow generally accepted accounting\nprocedures to document profitability and return on investment (ROI). The ROI for a given year is calculated by\ndividing the company's annual profit by the company's net investment. By projecting a company's revenues and\nexpenses into the future, financial analysts can predict future levels of profitability and ROI.\n\nWhen evaluating investment opportunities, companies seek projects that will increase ROI for the company as a whole.\nTo do so, a new project must, over time, provide a return on the new investment that is greater than the company's\nactual ROI. Thus, while an engineering economist might prefer using NPV analysis, senior management might prefer\nto know the expected ROI for a project. Some projects are very straightforward. If a new machine costs $100,000\nand saves $15,000 per year in operating expense, then the ROI will be 15% per year. However, major infrastructure\nprojects will never be so simple, because the initial investment may be spread out over several years, and the\nanticipated cash flows will likely vary from year to year.\n\nIt is of course possible to convert the initial investment into an equivalent investment I at time 0 and to convert the net\nrevenues into an equivalent annuity A that will continue forever. Once this is done, the return on investment is readily\nseen to be A/I. This is a very useful concept, but the result depends upon the discount rate that is used, and the choice\nof a discount rate depends upon the perspective of the user. Another approach makes it is possible to estimate of ROI\nfor a project without depending upon a pre-determined discount rate: simply find the discount rate that will make the\nNPV of the project's cash flows equal zero, in which case the ROI will equal the discount rate. This rate is known as\nthe internal rate of return (IRR). The higher the IRR the better, and companies in the private sector commonly use\nthis method to characterize the profitability of proposed projects.\n\nRanking projects by IRR only works for projects that are independent. If projects are mutually exclusive, then a\nsmaller project with a high IRR may prevent a larger project with lower IRR but much greater total returns.\n\nFor example, suppose a company has identified four options for expanding their operations, all of which would use\nthe same site. Various financial measures are given in Table 1 for each of these projects, and you are trying to decide\nif the annual net benefits are large enough to justify any of the investments. The annual benefits are expected to\ncontinue for a very long time, so the net present value of the benefits was estimated using the capital worth method,\ni.e. by dividing the annual benefits by 10%, which is your firm's minimum acceptable rate of return. The annual net\nbenefits of $90,000 for Project A would therefore be worth $90,000/10% = $900,000. Since this is less than the\ninvestment cost, project A has a negative net present value and should not be pursued. For the other three projects,\nthe present value of the benefits exceeds the investment cost, so that the NPV for each of these projects is greater than\nzero. Projects B, C, and D can therefore all be justified financially. If only one of the projects can be undertaken,\nthen C is the best, as it has the highest NPV.\n\nTable 1 Investment and Benefit Data for Four Projects\n\nProject\nInvestment (NPV\nas of time zero)\nEquivalent\nAnnual Net\nBenefits\nPresent Value of\nBenefits (Using\ncapital worth\nmethod)\nNet Present Value\nof Project\n\nIRR\nA\n$1 million\n$90,000\n$0.9 million\n($0.1 Million)\n9%\nB\n$2 million\n$440,000\n$4.4 million\n$2.4 million\n22%\nC\n$3 million\n$600,000\n$6.0 million\n$3 million\n20%\nD\n$4 million\n$480,000\n$4.8 million\n$0.8 million\n12%\n\nThe internal rate of return can easily be calculated for these projects by dividing the equivalent annual net benefits by\nthe investment, with the results shown in the final column of the table. Since the IRR is greater than the firm's MARR\nof 10% for projects B, C, and D, these projects are all acceptable, but Project A with its return of only 9% is\nunacceptable. If only one of these projects can be undertaken, then selection based upon IRR would choose project\nB - but didn't we just figure out that Project C was the best? What's going on? Why doesn't the IRR method result\nin the same choice as the NPV method? The fact that projects cannot simply be ranked by their IRR is a serious\nproblem with using this measure.\n\nA second problem with the IRR is that the process for estimating it could produce multiple answers. The problem of\ndueling IRRs could arise whenever the stream of annual cash flows switches from positive to negative more than once,\nwhich is why the IRR method is seldom praised by academics. In most projects presented to the board of directors,\nhowever, there will be a pretty clear initial investment that produces positive annual net benefits that continue for an\nindefinite period with at most a heavily discounted cost for decommissioning in the distant future. With such projects,\nthere will be an unambiguous result, which is why this method is commonly used in business.\n\nA third problem arises because the IRR methodology assumes that any cash received during the course of the project\ncan be reinvested at the same IRR, while future costs can be discounted using the IRR. For projects with a very high\nIRR, both assumptions could be very unrealistic.\n\nExternal Rate of Return\n\nSince the IRR method is so commonly used in business, it is important to understand how to deal with these problems\nthat might arise when it is used. A somewhat more complicated approach avoids the problem of multiple values for\nthe internal rate of return as well as the difficulty of assuming that costs and benefits can be discounted with what\ncould be a very high IRR. This approach uses what is called the external rate of return along with equivalence\nrelationships to create an easily understandable comparison between costs and benefits:\n\n-\nFirst, divide all of the periods considered in the analysis into periods where the cash flow is negative and\nperiods where the cash flow is positive. There is no need to distinguish between investment costs,\nrehabilitation costs, or operating losses.\n\n-\nNext consider the periods with negative cash flow. For each such period, we could establish a fund that\nwould be expected to grow over time so that it could be used when needed to cover the negative cash flow.\nThe size of the fund could be determined by using a discount rate that is consistent with the company's\nexpected overall return on investment during the intervening years. This discount rate - the external rate of\nreturn - could perhaps be the company's minimum acceptable rate of return or the company's average rate\nof return. All of the negative cash flows could be converted to an equivalent present value using this external\nrate of return for a discount rate.\n\n-\nNext, using the same external rate of return, all of the positive cash flows could be converted into a future\nvalue. The logic in extrapolating these funds to the future is that any extra cash generated by a specific\nproject will be used to promote the overall activities of the company. For example, if the company has\nhistorically enjoyed a rate of return of about 10%, and if conditions in the future are expected to be no\ndifferent, then the company could expect that the earnings from any new project in year t could be re-invested\nand earn 10% per year from year t until the end of the analysis period.\n\nFigure 1 summarizes the process of calculating a project's ROI using the external rate of return method.\n\nFigure 1 Calculating the External Rate of Return\nYear\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\nMillions of Dollars\nNPV Cost\nFV Benef i t s\nYear\n- 100\nMi l l i ons of D ol l ars\nCalculating the External Rate of Return\nNPV of Costs,\ndiscounted at e%\nFV of Benefits,\ninvested at e%\n\nThe discount rate used in these calculations is referred to as the \"external rate of return\", where \"external\" indicates\nthat the rate of return is based upon factors that are unrelated to the specific project that is being investigated. The\nsame external rate of return would be used for evaluating any project; it is not something that would have to be defined\nfor each specific project.\n\nGiven an external rate of return, the following comparison between the future value of the positive cash flows and the\npresent value of the negative cash flows can then be used to determine the return on investment (ROI) for this project:\n\n(Eq. 1)\nFV positive cash flows = (1 + ROI)n (PV costs)\nBefore using this equation, the external rate of return \"e\" must be used to calculate both the present value of costs and\nthe future value of benefits. The ROI that satisfies the equation can readily be obtained by trial and error using a\nspreadsheet. The ROI could by coincidence equal \"e\", but most likely will be higher or lower.1\n\n1 This section uses the term \"external rate of return,\" which is the term commonly seen in engineering economic textbooks. ERR\nis presented as a measure that is similar to, and better than, the internal rate of return, but it is not clear what is really meant by \"e\",\nthe external rate of return. However, consider a company that uses their own discount rate to determine the present worth of the\n\nThe external rate of return approach is favored by academics, as it avoids the necessity of implying unreasonable\nreturns for reinvesting profits, and it provides a reasonable means of dealing with future periods with negative cash\nflow. However, this approach is unlikely to be encountered outside of textbooks. Public agencies are apt to consider\nratios of benefits to cost rather than ROI, while private companies use the internal rate of return as an easier and\napparently more objective result.\n\nConstant Dollar vs. Current Dollar Analysis\n\nThe discount rate observed in the financial markets reflects three factors: the return available on risk free investments,\na risk premium, and inflation. Any analysis that uses historical or projected interest rates is using data that reflects\npast and future expectations concerning inflation. Inflation expectations are also among the many factors that affect\nthe price of stocks and real estate. Inflation is also a factor in MARRs of individuals, companies and government\nagencies.\n\nIt is important that inflation be treated consistently when evaluating projects. In estimating costs and revenues, it is\noften convenient to ignore inflation. So long as the major elements of cost and the major sources of revenue all\nincrease at about the same rate, a constant dollar analysis will result in a reasonable projection of cash flows. If there\nare some components that are expected to perform much differently, then some adjustments would have to be made\nin projecting cash flows. For example, the costs of computers and communications have declined for decades, so that\nit would be reasonable to assume that these costs would continue to decline relative to other costs. Over the last 20\nyears, energy costs have risen relative to other costs, and it would be reasonable that this trend would continue. Any\nproject that had significant costs related to communications, computers, or energy therefore might require adjustments\nin projections of constant dollar costs and revenues.\n\nGiven projections of cash flows, it is necessary to ensure that the discount rates are consistent with the assumptions\nabout inflation. Two sets of assumptions are reasonable:\n\n-\nConstant dollar: neither cash flows nor discount rates consider inflation\n-\nCurrent dollar: cash flows and discount rates both reflect inflation\n\nIf cash flows are provided in constant dollars, but are discounted with real discount rates, then future cash flows will\nbe discounted too much. If cash flows are provided in current (i.e. inflated) dollars, but are discounted with discount\nrates that do not consider inflation, then future cash flows will be insufficiently discounted.\n\nInflation in even the most stable economies during the most stable economic conditions will usually be at least 1-2%\na year; in other circumstances, inflation easily could be 3-4% per year in the most stable economies and much higher\nelsewhere. This is not a factor to be overlooked, as the mistakes could be considerable.\n\nChoosing Among Independent Investment Options\n\nConsider a company that has many independent investment opportunities. These opportunities are independent in the\nsense that choosing any one of them does not require or preclude any of the others. The company could decide to\nchoose none, any, or all of the options. In theory, the company could decide to invest in any project with positive\nNPV. If the NPV is positive, that means that the project will produce cash flows that will, when discounted at the\ncompany's MARR, be equivalent to having more money today. However, the company's MARR will be at least as\ngreat as its weighted average cost of capital, and the cost of capital conceivably could rise if the company attempted\n\ncosts of a project and the future worth of the benefits. \"Return on investment\" for a particular project would then be defined as the\nannual growth that would be needed for the present worth of project costs to grow into the future value of project benefits at the\nend of the project life. With this approach, there is no need to introduce \"e\" as something new, because the usual discount rate\nwould be used in the calculation. The return on investment for the project would then be seen as a clearly defined measure that is\nnaturally dependent upon the use of the proper discount rate, just as NPV is dependent upon the use of the proper discount rate.\n\nto raise excessive amounts. The company's executives and board of directors would also have some concerns about\nthe quality of the analysis and the possibility that some projects might prove to be less successful than they hoped for.\nAs a result, the funds available for projects would likely be limited, and only the best projects would be chosen. The\nobjective would therefore be to maximize NPV subject to a capital budget constraint, which would be equivalent to\nmaximizing the return on investment for the capital that is budgeted.\n\nIn practice, many companies use the IRR in evaluating independent projects. The IRR can easily be used to rank all\nprojects according to a common metric. The IRR will be deemed acceptable so long as it is higher than the companies\nMARR (usually viewed as the company's weighted average cost of capital). The decision process is straightforward\n(Figure 2), at least related to strictly financial matters: choose the projects with the highest IRR, so long as the IRR\nexceeds the hurdle rate and the total investment is within the budgeted amount.\n\nFigure 2 Selecting Projects Based Upon a Hurdle Rate of Return\nSelecting Projects Based Upon a\nHurdle Rate of Return\nInvestment ($ millions)\nRate of Return (%/year)\nROI\nHurdle Rate\nBudget Constraint\n\nThis process of ranking projects by their IRR assumes that the risks associated with the project are similar, so that\nthey can each be compared to the same hurdle rate. A large company with many diverse opportunities for cutting\ncosts or expanding markets will in fact have many investment options with similar risks: they know what to expect if\nthey decide to make the investment. If the company is moving into a new type of business or if an investment is\nbelieved to have unusual risks, then a higher hurdle rate could be used. If an investment is deemed essential to the\ncompany's safety or to its continued operation, then the investment will be made even with an IRR lower than the\nhurdle rate.\n\nAs with so many elegant frameworks, this clear and logical process for selecting projects may not work so clearly or\nlogically in practice. While a company indeed should know its MARR, that may be a subject of debate or it may not\nbe something that is ever explicitly defined. The elegant model indicates that all projects whose expected return\nexceeds the MARR should be approved, ignoring the fact that there is always some kind of limit for capital\nexpenditures. The limit is undoubtedly flexible, but that means that marginally acceptable projects may be approved\nonly if they are supported by people with the power or persuasiveness necessary to convince the board of directors.\nThe decision model depicted above also assumes that there is an ordered list of all of the feasible projects, none of\nwhich are mutually exclusive. No one who has ever seriously considered design will assume that they can ever know\nall of the alternatives, many of which will certainly be mutually exclusive. In a large organization, whether public or\nprivate, leaders from each department will be promoting their own projects; those who are more diligent, more\neloquent, or closer to the senior officials may be the ones whose projects are approved.\n\nThere may well be many better projects that no one thought of or that no one wanted to champion. If you are an\nanalyst or a consultant or a reviewer of a project, it is your job to look for some of those other options. Some\npossibilities would include:\n\n-\nUse of better materials and techniques to build the same facility\n-\nA better structural design to serve the same purpose\n-\nA different location for a similar project\n-\nA different scale - many smaller projects or fewer larger projects\n\nIn general, no one can prove that their design or proposed project is the best. They can only defend, refine, or abandon\ntheir proposal in response to whatever feedback and opposition they receive.\n\nRanking Independent Projects using Present Value, Future Value, Annual Value or IRR\n\nIf making money is your objective, then ranking projects by present, future or annual value would certainly seem to\nbe the correct approach. The rankings obtained by using any of these three approaches would be the same, as the\ndifferences among them depend upon factors that vary only with the discount rate and the period of the investments.\nIf the projects are independent and budgets are unlimited, then any project with positive NPV would be worth\npursuing. If the NPV is greater than zero, then the internal rate of return will be greater than the discount rate, so that\nthe IRR will also identify which projects should be pursued. However, as shown in the next subsection, the projects\nwill not always be independent, and that is when difficulties are likely to arise in ranking projects using the IRR.\n\nChoosing Among Mutually Exclusive Projects\n\nSometimes competing projects cannot all be pursued. They may both use the same land (should we build a hotel or\nan office building on this site?), they may offer different solutions to the same problem (should we build a bridge or a\ntunnel?), or they may be related to competing strategies of production and distribution (small retail outlets in every\nneighborhood or large box stores to serve the entire region?). There will also be variations in projects related to design\nand scale of effort: should the sports stadium seat 30, 50, or 75 thousand spectators? Should the bridge have four or\nsix lanes? Should apartments have four rooms or five rooms? In cases like this, once a particular design is selected,\nthe others are no longer available; the choices are mutually exclusive.\n\nWhen selecting from a group of mutually exclusive projects, it does make sense (from a financial perspective) to\nmaximize the net present value of cash flow. The best project will indeed be the one that is equivalent to the largest\namount of money today.\n\nHowever, if a company evaluates projects by choosing the ones with the highest IRR, problems are likely to arise. A\nprior example has already shown that the project with the highest IRR may not be the best project. The following\nexample shows that the key to properly using IRR is to consider the rate of return on each increment of investment.\nIf an incremental investment exceeds the MARR, then that increment can be justified, even if it lowers the IRR for\nthe project.\n\nTable 2 summarizes the investment and expected annual net income for four options for developing a site: build a\nparking lot or construct a building with one, two or three stories. If we assume that the same net income would\ncontinue indefinitely, then the annual rate of return would be the net income divided by the investment. For example,\nthe parking lot's rate of return would be $22,000/$200,000 = 11%. We could also estimate the present worth of the\nincome using the capital worth method: present worth equals annual income divided by our discount rate, and the\nNPV of the project would be the present worth of the income minus the investment cost. For the parking lot, assuming\na 10% discount rate, the NPV would be $22,000/10% - $200,000 = $20,000. Table 3 shows the rate of return and the\npresent worth for these four options.\n\nTable 2 Mutually Exclusive Options for Developing a Site\nProject\nInvestment Required\nAnnual Net Income\nParking lot\n$200,000\n$22,000\nOne-story building\n$4,000,000\n$600,000\nTwo-story building\n$5,500,000\n$720,000\nThree-story building\n$7,500,000\n$960,000\n\nTable 3 IRR and NPV for the Mutually Exclusive Options for Developing a Site\nProject\nInternal Rate of Return\nNet Present Value\nParking lot\n11.0%\n$20\nOne-story building\n15.0%\n$200\nTwo-story building\n13.1%\n$170\nThree-story building\n12.8%\n$210\n\nIf our hurdle rate equals our discount rate of 10%, then all of the projects are acceptable, whether we consider the IRR\nor the Net Present Value. However, if we have to choose just one of these, then we have a problem. Considering\nonly the return on investment, the best choice appears to be the one-story building with its 15% return. However, the\nthree-story building has a higher net present value. Which is really the best project? In your presentation to the board\nof directors, do you recommend the one-story building because the company always uses IRR to rank projects? Do\nyou recommend the three-story building because the text books always recommend maximizing NPV? Do you accept\na suggestion to compromise on a two-story building? What should you do?\n\nTo deal with these questions, it is necessary to do the analysis one step at a time, beginning with the option that requires\nthe least investment, which in this case is the parking lot. Since the IRR of this project exceeds the hurdle rate of 10%,\nit is acceptable. The question now concerns the additional benefits that might be obtained from additional investment\nin this site. The one-story building requires an additional $3.8 million dollar investment in order to gain an additional\n$578 thousand in annual income. The rate of return for this incremental investment is therefore $578/$3800 = 15.2%,\nwhich is well above the hurdle rate. The NPV for this building is ten times greater than the NPV for the parking lot,\nso both measures indicate that the one-story building would be a good investment. Now we need to consider the\nbenefit to be gained by the additional investment required to go from one to two stories. The additional investment\nof $1.5 million produces additional net income of $120,000 per year, so the ROI for the increment is only 8%, which\nis less than our hurdle rate of 10%. Thus, the two-story building is not as good as the one-story building. Although\nthe IRR for this building is 13.1%, which is well above the hurdle rate, the incremental return for the additional $1.5\nmillion is unacceptable. If we just look at the NPV, we immediately reject the two-story building because the NPV is\n$30,000 less than the NPV of the one-story building.\n\nNow we proceed to the fourth and final option, the three-story building. We compare this building to the best of the\nprevious options, namely the one-story building. The incremental investment in this case is $3.5 million and the\nincremental net income is $360 thousand, so the incremental return is 10.3%, which is just over the 10% hurdle rate.\nTherefore, the incremental investment is in fact justifiable. Once again, the NPV immediately gives the same result:\nthe three-story building has the highest NPV and therefore is the preferred investment.\n\nIt is conceivable that the board of directors might be unwilling to commit $7.5 million to this site. If so, someone who\nhadn't followed the logic very closely might suggest cutting back to the two-story building, which after all has an IRR\nof 13.1% (perhaps snidely noting that this is higher than the 12.8% for the option recommended by the junior analyst).\nThat would be the point in the meeting where you have to stand your ground: if the board is unwilling to commit $7.5\nmillion, then they should stay with the one-story building because it has a higher NPV than the two-story building.\nAnd, if necessary, explain that the incremental $1.5 investment required for the two-story building would be better\ninvested in another of the company's projects.\n\nThe procedure illustrated in this example can be used with any set of mutually exclusive investment alternatives:\n\n-\nRank the alternatives in increasing order of investment required.\n-\nEstimate the IRR for the each alternative.\n-\nChoose as a base case the first alternative whose IRR exceeds the hurdle rate.\n-\nCompare the next alternative (i.e. the alternative with the next highest investment requirement) to the base\ncase:\no\nCalculate the IRR for the incremental investment.\no\nIf the incremental IRR is unacceptable, consider the next alternative and repeat this step.\no\nIf the incremental IRR is acceptable, make this alternative the new base case and repeat this step\nuntil either the capital budget is reached or all alternatives have been tested.\n\nThis process will find the highest investment that can be justified among the competing projects. It will also select\nthe project with the highest NPV - which is why it is desirable to estimate the NPV even when you must present\nresults in terms of IRR.\n\nDealing with Unequal Lives of Competing Projects\n\nCompeting projects may well have different project lives. If so, then several approaches can be taken to ensure that\ncomparisons are done in a reasonable manner.\n\nOne possibility would be to choose a longer period that is an integral multiple of the lives expected for each of the\nprojects. It could then be assumed that the projects would be repeated two or more times over the course of extended\nperiod of analysis. For example, if competing projects have lives of three years or four years, then the analysis of\neach could be done for a period of 12 years, as this would involve four cycles of the three-year projects and three\ncycles of the four-year projects. This approach could lead to some extraordinarily long life cycles if there are many\nprojects with many different lives. For example, if projects have lives of five, seven or ten years, then a 70-year\nproject life would be needed to have an integral number of cycles for each project. The problem with such a long\nproject life is that it is very likely that technology, population, related development, and prices would change so much\nas to make very long-term estimates very questionable. It is not reasonable to use a 70-year horizon to compare\noptions that all have lives of at most ten years.\n\nA second approach would be to use the annuity value rather than the net present value. The assumption underlying\nthis approach would be that any of the projects could either be extended at the same or a similar annuity value or be\nreplaced by better projects. If the projects have similar, but not identical lives, the differences will not be dramatic:\n\nFundamentally, Equivalent Annual Cost is a robust measure regardless of the alterations from the original\nproject and its identical repetition assumption. ... In reality, projects often do not repeat, but are rarely\ndivested during their first life and dramatic cost change occurs only in the long run.2\n\nFor typical projects, where the effect of unexpected early termination is minor and discount rates exceed 10%, the\nequivalent annual cost is reasonable to use even though projects have different lives. For riskier projects or projects\nwith great uncertainty in cash flows, sensitivity analysis must be done to consider the effect of early termination and\nvariable cash flows on the equivalent annual cost.3\n\n2 Ted G. Eschenbach, Robert B. Koplar, and Alice E. Smith, \"Violating the Identical Repetition Assumption of EAC\", 1990\nInternational Industrial Engineering Conference Proceedings, Institute of Industrial Engineers, pp. 99-103\n3 Idem.\n\nA third approach would be to include a residual value for each project at the end of the analysis period. The assumption\nunderlying this approach is that it is possible to estimate residual values, which may be feasible, but which may also\nbe much more trouble that it is worth.\n\nA fourth approach is simply to use a long enough time period that any differences would be minimal. If discount rates\nare greater than 10%, then what happens after 20-30 years will have minimal impact on NPV.\n\nAs always, it is important to use common sense. When in doubt, do some sensitivity analysis using different time\nperiods to determine to what extent, if any, the choice of the period of analysis is causing differences in rankings\namong the alternatives. There is no \"right\" method that must be followed.\n\nSplitting a Project into Pieces for Different Parties\n\nSo far, we have considered the perspective of entrepreneurs, developers, companies, or agencies as they evaluate their\noptions for undertaking construction projects. The discount rates and hurdle rates that they use will reflect their own\ninvestment opportunities, their own cost of capital, and their own perceptions of the risks associated with the projects\nthat they are examining. If their projects are funded entirely by cash on hand, then this is the only perspective that\nmatters.\n\nMore commonly, financing a project is only possible if a major portion of the money required for the investment can\nbe raised from outside investors. If this money is a small portion of the total funds sought by the company, then the\ncost of the capital required (i.e. the interest rate on loans or bonds and the price per share of stock that is sold) can be\nassumed to relate to the overall financial strength of the company or agency. The discount rate used in the calculation\nof the present worth and the hurdle rate would be at least as high as the organization's weighted average cost of capital,\nand the financing of any particular project would be a small part of the overall financial management of the company\nor the agency.\n\nAdditional analysis will be necessary if the project is undertaken as a stand-along activity of a new company, if the\nproject requires funding that is tied to its actual results (rather than to the overall financial strength or the organization),\nor if the project is a major departure from prior activities of the company. The project may require loans from a bank\nthat are secured by the expected rents, tolls, or other proceeds of the project. The value of the company's stock could\nbe related directly to the success of the project, taking into account the interest payments which must be paid to banks\nor bondholders before any dividends can be paid to stockholders. In these situations, it is necessary to consider the\ndifferent perspectives of the potential investors.\n\nA mortgage is a loan that is secured by a lien on the property. If mortgage payments are not made in a timely fashion,\nthe mortgage holder has the right to foreclose on the property. Since the loan is backed by property, the mortgage is\nless risky than an unsecured loan, and the interest payments on a mortgage will be lower than the interest on an\nunsecured loan. It is possible to have multiple mortgages on a property. If so, then the mortgage agreements will\nstate the order in which payments will be made if there is insufficient cash to make all of the contractual payments.\nThe first mortgage will generally have priority over the second or any other mortgages, meaning that the holder of the\nfirst mortgage has first call on the cash flows of the company. The risk of not getting paid is therefore higher for the\nholder of a second mortgage than for the holder of the first mortgage.\n\nAfter the payments are made on secured loans, the next priority will be to make payments on unsecured loans and to\npay interest on bonds. If a company is unable to make such payments, then it can be forced to declare bankruptcy. A\nbankrupt company can in many cases suspend mortgage payments, interest payments, taxes and other fixed charges\nin order to reduce the outflow of cash while attempting to reorganize.\n\nAfter all of the fixed charges and taxes are covered, whatever cash is left over can be paid out as dividends to\nstockholders or re-invested in the company. This portion of the cash flow will vary with the success of the company\nor the project; the higher the fixed charges as a total proportion of expected cash flows, the more uncertain the\n\nprospects for the company. The value of the company to the owners depends upon this portion of the cash flow: the\nhigher and the more reliable the cash flow, the greater the value of the company.\n\nSummary\n\nMaximize the Net Present Value of Cash Flows\n\nThe equivalent worth methods provide the best way to compare alternatives. If the net present value is positive, then\na project is worth pursuing, at least from the financial perspective. If the net present value is negative, then it is not\nworth pursuing. If the net present value is positive, then any future values and annuity values will also be positive, so\nany of these measures can be used to determine whether or not a project is worthwhile from the financial or economic\nperspective. Moreover, each of these measures will produce the same ranking of independent alternatives and the\nsame choice among mutually exclusive alternatives.\n\nUsing the Internal Rate of Return to Rank Projects\n\nCompanies commonly use a different measure, the internal rate of return, to rank competing proposals for projects.\nThe internal rate of return is useful because it can be calculated without reference to any pre-determined discount rate.\nIt therefore appears to provide an objective assessment and an obvious means of ranking independent alternatives.\nHowever, there are three potential problems in using this measure to rank projects:\n\n-\nIf cash flows are highly variable, with multiple periods where cash flows are negative, then the methods used\nto estimate IRR may come up with two values.\n-\nThis method implies that all positive cash flows can be reinvested at the IRR over the life of the project. In\nfact, cash obtained from the project may have to be invested in ways that have much different returns.\n-\nThis method does not provide the correct rankings for mutually exclusive alternatives. It is necessary to\nconsider the incremental return for incremental investments to determine which of such alternatives is best.\n\nThe IRR can be modified to deal with the first two problems by using an external rate of return for converting all\nperiods with negative cash flow to an equivalent present value and converting all periods with positive cash flow to\nan equivalent future value. The rate of return is then uniquely defined as the annual return that will cause the present\nvalue of the costs to grow into the future value of the benefits. This approach will still require analysis of incremental\nreturns for incremental investments in order to obtain the correct selection among mutually exclusive alternatives.\n\nThe Importance of Project Life\n\nWhen comparing alternatives, the time period needs to be chosen with some care. In general, a period of 20-30 years\nwill be sufficient because the discounted costs and benefits of more distant benefits will add very little to the present\nworth of a project. The choice of a time period should not determine the outcome of the analysis. If costs and benefits\nhave both reached a steady state by the end of the analysis period, then there is no reason to worry about the choice of\nthe project life, so long as the discounted cash flows from the excluded years contribute little or nothing to the present\nworth. If either costs or benefits are expected to rise or fall sharply just after the end of the analysis period, then a\nlonger period will be needed. For example, if extensive rehabilitation is anticipated around 22-25 years, then the use\nof a 20-year life could be very misleading and a 30-year life would be better. In some cases, where there are\nextraordinary costs or benefits in the far distant future, much longer time periods should be considered. For example,\nthe costs of dismantling an obsolete nuclear power plant and the ultimate costs of safely disposing or sequestering\nspent nuclear fuel should be included in the analysis, even if such costs are expected only after 40 or more years of\noperations.\n\nChoosing Among Mutually Exclusive Alternatives.\n\nIf selecting one option precludes other options, then the options are mutually exclusive. The basic rule is to choose\nthe option with the highest NPV (which will also have the highest annuity value and the highest future value),\n\nIf the internal rate of return is used, then care must be taken in ranking projects, because the project with the highest\nIRR will not necessarily be the best project. Constructing a smaller project with a higher IRR may preclude a larger\nproject with a lower, but still acceptable IRR. It is therefore necessary to follow a well-defined procedure in\ndetermining which project is best.\n\n-\nRank the mutually exclusive projects in order of increasing investment requirements\n-\nDetermine the IRR for each project\n-\nStarting with the smallest project, select the first project with an acceptable IRR as the base project\n-\nCalculate the incremental costs and incremental benefits for each larger project.\n-\nCalculate the incremental rate of return for each larger project.\n-\nSelect the first project larger than the base project that has an acceptable incremental rate of return. This\nbecomes the new base project.\n-\nRepeat the analysis of incremental costs relative the most recent base project.\n-\nIf there are no projects for which the incremental benefits justify the incremental costs, then the most recent\nbase project is the best project.\n\nDiscussion: the Limits of Financial Analysis\n\nIn the private sector, financial performance will usually be what is most important in project evaluation. However, in\nthe public sector, where projects are undertaken to meet public needs rather than to make a profit, economic, social,\nenvironmental, and sustainability issues will also be relevant. To the extent that economic factors can be expressed\nin monetary terms, it will be possible to use the same methodologies to calculate the NPV and the IRR. However,\nthese global measures will not be the only things to consider when evaluating any complex project. Other economic\nissues will include distributional equity (who wins and who loses), regional economic impact (the use of local labor\nand resources and the multiplier effect on the local economy), and non-financial externalities (environmental and\nsocial impacts and the need for remediation). Any large project will have an impact on the public, and there will likely\nbe many costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify and even more difficult to value. In some cases, non-\nquantifiable factors will be the major issues in project evaluation.\n\nIn conclusion, despite spending a great deal of time focusing on financial matters and believing that financial\nfeasibility is essential for any project, we must recognize that financial feasibility may have little or nothing to do with\nproject desirability. Whether or not it is possible to get money to build something is much different from whether or\nnot something should be built. Financing difficulties may preclude certain highly desirable projects, yet encourage\nother clearly undesirable projects.\n\nEngineers, managers, planners, and politicians have some personal responsibility for pursuing desirable projects that\nare financially feasible. Project evaluation depends upon proper presentation of estimated costs and benefits and\ndisclosure of assumptions concerning discount rates, project lives, and the types and distribution of costs and benefits.\nIt is not enough to show that a particular project can be justified; it is also necessary to show that it is better than the\navailable alternatives.\n\nRules of the Game: Taxes, Depreciation and Regulation\nThe zoning law of 1916 - the nation's first - regulated the bulk of buildings, their height, and their\nuses. It divided the city into three zones - residential, business, and unrestricted - and empowered\nthe Board of Estimate to regulate the use, height, and bulk of every building on every street in the\ncity, depending upon what zone the block was in.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nGovernment policies affect how projects are conceived, what kinds of projects can or cannot be implemented, where\nprojects can or cannot be built, how projects can or cannot be constructed, and how successful they will be once they\nare implemented. The most important policies relate to taxes, land use, safety, and the environment. These policies\nare in effect \"rules of the game\" that limit what kinds of developments can be pursued and influence how the players\ntabulate their scores, i.e. their profits and their ability to complete projects. The players - real estate companies,\nentrepreneurs, public agencies, infrastructure operators, investors, banks - still have to figure out what they want to\ndo and how to do it, but they must abide by the rules that have been established. Changing the rules will change the\nway that the game is played, and the rules can be adjusted to promote projects that are believed to provide economic,\nsocial, environmental or sustainability benefits for the public.\n\nTaxes are relevant to project evaluation because taxes affect cash flows. If the goal is to maximize the net present\nvalue of cash flows, then it is necessary to consider taxes. Moreover, local, state and federal governments may impose\ntaxes or offer tax credits in order to discourage or promote certain kinds of development, so it is important to be able\nto comprehend the effects of tax policy on project design and evaluation. Different kinds of taxes may apply to the\nprofits from constructing, operating, and selling infrastructure, so it is necessary to understand how tax laws categorize\neach type of expenditure and each type of revenue. Accounting rules established by law or by regulation determine\nwhat kinds of expenses are treated as current expenses and what kinds are treated as capital expenditures. Arcane\nrules may determine whether money spent on rehabilitating infrastructure is treated as operating expense - which is\nfully deductible as an expense in the current year - or a capital expense that can only be deducted from taxable income\nover a period of many years.\n\nZoning is the major tool used by local governments to guide land use. Zoning restrictions limit the types of\ndevelopment that may be pursued in certain locations, such as restricting one area to residential use while specifying\nanother area as suitable for industrial use. Zoning restrictions may also limit the size or height of buildings or the\nlocation of buildings on a site.\n\nBuilding codes define what types of construction materials, designs, and methods can be utilized. Regulations can be\nestablished to reduce risks during construction or operation or decommissioning of a project. New technologies, such\nas the use of plastic pipes for plumbing, had to be approved for use in building codes before they could be widely\nused. In transportation, governments may create design standards for highways and bridges that serve a similar\nfunction, i.e. promotion of safety during construction and operation. Likewise, governments may establish standards\nfor the construction and operation of water resource systems and for other types of infrastructure.\n\nEnvironmental restrictions restrict the nature, location and cost of projects. Land use regulations may include\nrestrictions on development in or near wetlands or waterways. There may be restrictions on the types of materials that\nare used in construction, such as laws that prohibit the use of asbestos because of the link between asbestos and lung\ncancer. There may also be restrictions that limit the types of work that can be undertaken at night, so as to limit the\n\n1 New York City implemented zoning to avoid turning Manhattan into dark canyons, with skyscrapers towering above and keeping\nlight and fresh air away from city streets.

Contractors may be required to take special precautions to prevent dust and run-off from\nconstruction sites from contaminating nearby areas.\n\nDepreciation and Taxes\n\nTaxes and financial statements are structured according to strict guidelines known as generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. By following these guidelines, it is possible to define terms such as profit and return on investment (ROI).\nProfit, ROI and other measures used in financial statements are critical because investors and analysts use these\nmeasures in judging whether or not to invest in a company. The financial markets rely upon the validity and the\ncomparability of data produced by companies in their financial statements. Therefore, if a company sells stocks or\nbonds, it is required to use accepted accounting principles in preparing those statements, as well as in preparing their\ntax returns.\n\nSince taxes are large cash flows, they cannot be ignored when evaluating projects. And, since the amount of taxes to\nbe paid depends upon accounting rules, it is necessary to understand some basic concepts of accounting. One of the\nmost important rules is that capital expenditures cannot be treated as a current expense, but instead must be spread out\nover many years as a depreciation expense.\n\nFor example, operating expenses for a building include such things as electricity for lights, oil for heat and wages for\nthe people who manage and maintain the building. At the end of each week or month, the owner of the building knows\nhow much was spent on electricity, oil and wages: the lights worked, the building was warm, the rooms and hallways\nwere cleaned, and rents were collected. The money was spent, the work was done, and now it's time to do it again in\nthe next month.\n\nThe capital expenditures that were required to create the building are entirely different. The building may have cost\n$10 million to construct, and when the construction was complete the owner may have a mortgage for $10 million -\nbut the owner also has a building. Now, the building may or may not be worth $10 million, because the value of the\nbuilding depends upon the real estate market, the condition of the building, and the annual rent payments, not the cost\nof the building. However, the accounting assumption is that if the building cost $10 million to construct, then the\nbuilding is an asset worth $10 million when it is put into service. The owners may have spent $10 million, but they\nhave created an asset worth $10 million, so they have not had any loss in value.\n\nThe same concept could be applied to the purchase of a car for $20,000, the construction of a bus terminal for $20\nmillion, or the construction of a vast pipeline for $2 billion. The money may have been spent, but an asset has been\ncreated, and accountants will record the book value of the asset as being equal to the investment cost. So right at the\nbeginning of the life of the asset we have an accounting assumption that is accepted, even though it most likely is\nwrong. The car may be worth only $15,000 as soon as we drive it out of the dealer's lot; the bus terminal may only\nbe worth $10 million to anyone other than the bus company, while it may be worth $30 million to the bus company.\nWe don't quibble about this discrepancy between book value and real value, not because we are so flexible in our\nthinking, but because the tax collector tells us that we will use the accountant's book value as one factor in computing\nthe taxes we owe. If you want to use the real value of the asset in your own internal reporting, that is fine; just don't\nconfuse the book value and the real value when doing your taxes. Also, although we really do know what we paid for\nthe car, the bus terminal and the pipeline, we probably do not know what they really are worth today. So, it will be\nconvenient for us, as well as the tax collector, to use the accounting assumption.\n\nNow we have a place to start for figuring out depreciation, namely the book value of the asset. We could perhaps now\ntry to determine how much the asset deteriorates each year, so we could use the actual decline in life as the amount of\ndepreciation. This turns out to be a difficult task. What is the expected life of a car? How much of the life of a car is\nconsumed by time? By usage? By exposure to rain and snow? It is possible to do some engineering analyses to\nanswer questions like these, but the tangle of assumptions and analyses will quickly become quite thick. For internal\npurposes, say for a rental car company, it might be a very good thing to understand the life of cars based upon the kind\nof usage they receive and whether they are based in the heat of Florida or the snow and ice of Minnesota. For most\n\ncompanies, however, it would probably be a difficult calculation with little or no benefit to management; a plan to\nreplace company cars after five years will be sufficient for them. However, all companies will have to use an accepted\nmethodology to account for depreciation of their cars.\n\nAt this point, we need three more accounting assumptions to make it easy to estimate depreciation:\n\n-\nThe life of the asset\n-\nThe salvage value of the asset (which would not include the value of land, as land is generally assumed not\nto depreciate in value)\n-\nThe depreciation rate over the life of the asset\n\nThe life of the asset could be defined based upon some sort of study of past experience - or it could be defined by the\ntax collector. A car, for example, might be assumed to have a life of ten years, while a bus terminal or a pipeline\nmight be assumed to have a life of thirty or fifty years. The salvage value is the remaining value of the asset at the\nend of its life. For a car, the salvage value might be the scrap value of the car, which might be assumed to be 5% of\nthe original purchase price. For a bus terminal or a pipeline, the salvage value might be assumed to be the book value\nof the land (i.e. the purchase price of the land required for the project) or a percentage of the investment cost. The\naccounting principle is that depreciation causes the book value of an asset to decline from the original investment cost\nto its salvage value at the end of the asset's life. The depreciation could most easily be assumed to proceed at a constant\nrate over the life of the asset:\n\n(Eq. 1)\nAnnual Depreciation = (Investment - Salvage)/Life\n\nIf the life of a $4 million asset is ten years and the salvage value is $1 million, then the asset would depreciate in value\nfrom $4 million to $1 million over its ten-year life, for an average depreciation rate of $0.3 million per year (Figure\n1). This is called \"straight-line depreciation\", because the book value of the asset declines in a straight line from\nthe initial investment cost to the salvage value.\n\nFigure 1 Straight-Line Depreciation\nStraight Line Depreciation\ndk = (B - S)/N\ndk = Deprec. year k\nB = Cost Basis\nS = salvage value\nN = life\nBook value year k =\nB - k*dk\nSalvage\n9 10\nYear\nThousands\nBook Value & Depreciation\nDepreciation\nBook Value\n\nOther approaches to depreciation can be imagined. One might argue that depreciation should be greater at first, to\nreflect the immediate loss in value of cars and some other assets. Once we have accepted that the accounting\nassumptions may be tied to convenience rather than reality, it is easy to come up with some alternatives. For example,\ninstead of assuming a fixed amount of depreciation over the life of the asset, it would be possible each year to take a\nfixed percentage (P%) of the remaining book value over the life of the asset, without considering the salvage value at\nall.\n\n(Eq. 2)\nFirst year depreciation = (P%)(Investment)\n\n(Eq. 3)\nReduced book value at end of first year = (1-P%) (Investment)\n\n(Eq. 4)\nSecond year depreciation = (P%)(1-P%)(Investment)\n\n(Eq. 5)\nYear N depreciation = P% (Book value at end of year N-1)\n\nThese equations can readily be used to create a table in a spreadsheet that shows the initial book value in each year,\nthe amount of depreciation allowed in that year, and the final book value.\n\nWith the same example used above, suppose the book value was depreciated by twice the amount allowed under\nstraight line depreciation, which would be 20% of the remaining value each year for ten years. This method is called\ndouble declining balance depreciation, because the amount of depreciation allowed in the first year is double the\namount allowed under straight line depreciation. The book value would decline by (0.20) $4 million = $800,000 in\nthe first year. In the second year, the initial book value would therefore be $3.2 million, and it would decline by (0.20)\n$3.2 million = $640,000 in the second year. Each subsequent year the amount of the depreciation would decline by a\nsmaller amount, as illustrated in Figure 2. For the first five years, the annual depreciation is higher using the double\ndeclining balance, but after that the fixed depreciation of $0.3 million under the straight line approach is better.\n\nThis method can be used with other percentages, and the general method is known as declining balance depreciation.\n\nFigure 2 Double Declining Balance Depreciation\nDeclining Balance Depreciation\nd1 = B*R\ndk = B*(1-R)k-1*R\nB = Cost Basis\nBVk = B*(1-R)k\nBVN = B*(1-R)N\nSalvage value is not\nincluded directly\nR = 1/N is straight line\nR= 2/N is double\ndeclining balance\n9 10\nYear\nThousands\nDepreciation\nDepreciation\nBook Value\n\nA related approach is to use the declining balance approach only so long as that approach results in depreciation greater\nthan the straight-line approach. Using this method, it is necessary to compare the depreciation for the declining balance\napproach with the depreciation that would be obtained by switching to straight-line depreciation of the remaining book\nvalue over the remaining life. Once the straight line approach provides greater depreciation, switch to that approach\nand continue over the life of the project. Once again, this method can readily be examined in a spreadsheet:\n\n-\nStart by using the declining balance in the first year.\n-\nFor the second year, calculate depreciation using two methods:\no\nContinue using the declining balance method.\n\no\nDetermine the depreciation of the book value at the beginning of the year using the straight line\nmethod (Eq. 1).\n-\nIf the depreciation under the straight line method is higher than that allowed under the declining balance\nmethod, then switch to that method; if not, then continue to use the declining balance method.\n\nThis method is illustrated in Figure 3. Table 1 compares the book value and the annual depreciation for the three\nmethods. Like the double declining balance method, this approach provides a way to accelerate depreciation of an\nasset, thereby allowing larger tax deductions during the early years of an assets life.\n\nFigure 3 Double Declining Balance Reverting to Straight Line Depreciation in Year 6\nDeclining Balance Depreciation with\nSwitchover to Straight-Line Method\nStart with double\ndeclining balance\nCalculate the annual\ndepreciation for the\nremaining balance using\nstraight-line method (for\nthe current book value\nand the remaining life)\nSwitch to straight line\nwhen that method gives\nmore depreciation\n9 10\nYear\nThousands\nDepreciation & Book Value\nDepreciation\nBook Value\n\nTable 1 Three Methods of Depreciating an Asset With Initial\nBook Value of $4 Million and a Life of Ten Years ($ millions)\n\nStraight Line\nDouble Declining Balance\nDouble Declining Balance\nReverting to Straight Line\nYear\nBook Value at\nBeginning of\nYear\nDepreciation\nBook Value\nat Beginning\nof Year\nDepreciation\nBook Value\nat Beginning\nof Year\nDepreciation\n$4.000\n$0.300\n$4.000\n$0.800\n$4.000\n$0.800\n$3.700\n$0.300\n$3.200\n$0.640\n$3.200\n$0.640\n$3.400\n$0.300\n$2.560\n$0.512\n$2.560\n$0.512\n$3.100\n$0.300\n$2.048\n$0.410\n$2.048\n$0.410\n$2.800\n$0.300\n$1.638\n$0.328\n$1.638\n$0.328\n$2.500\n$0.300\n$1.311\n$0.262\n$1.311\n$0.2621\n$2.200\n$0.300\n$1.049\n$0.210\n$1.049\n$0.2621\n$1.900\n$0.300\n$0.839\n$0.168\n$0.786\n$0.2621\n$1.600\n$0.300\n$0.671\n$0.134\n$0.524\n$0.2621\n$1.300\n$0.300\n$0.537\n$0.107\n$0.262\n$0.2621\n$1.000\n\n$0.429\n\n$0.000\n\nOne might think that these rather arbitrary methods would require a great deal of bookkeeping, plus considerable\ntrouble figuring out what the life of an asset is. That is true. And the accountants, legislators, and tax collectors in\nthe U.S. have therefore come up with an even simpler approach for accelerated depreciation of assets. The U.S.\nInternal Revenue Service allows companies to use what is called the \"Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System\n(MACRS),\" which was introduced in 1986. This system divides assets into six categories, defines an asset life for\neach category, and assumes the salvage value is zero. Another simplifying assumption is that the first and last years\nof an assets life are assumed to be exactly six months, so it is not necessary to track the actual date that assets were\nput into service. Since there are only a limited number of options, standard lengths for the first and last years, no\nsalvage value, and no need to determine lives, book-keeping is simplified and there is no need to justify the choice of\nan asset life. As noted above, the term \"accelerated\" means that the lives in the MACRS are generally shorter than\n\nwhat were previously used, so that companies can take more depreciation sooner. The option for using straight line\ndepreciation is still available for some assets.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nIndividuals and companies pay income taxes that are calculated as a percentage of annual income. Income taxes may\nbe progressive, which means that the amount of tax increases as a percentage of income for higher levels of income.\nThe maximum tax rates vary from country to country, and a country may raise or lower tax rates from time to time.\nIn the United States, additional income taxes are imposed by most of the states and some of the largest cities.\n\nState and local taxes are deductible expenses when calculating federal income taxes, so that the effective income tax\nrate will be:\n\n(Eq. 6)\nEffective Income Tax Rate = SR + LR + FR(1 - SR - LR)\n\nWhere:\n\nSR = state income tax rate\n\nLR = local income tax rate\n\nFR = federal income rate\n\nConsider a company that pays federal taxes at a rate of 34% plus state taxes of 6% and a city tax of 1%. Their effective\nincome tax rate will be:\n\n(Eq. 7)\nEffective Income Tax Rate = 6% + 1% + 34%(1-.06-.01) = 39.55%\n\nIncome taxes can have a large impact of cash flows, and it is necessary to consider how taxes relate to profits, return\non investment, internal rate of return (IRR) or the minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR) for a company or an\nindividual. Such financial objectives can be calculated before or after income taxes. The relationship between the\nbefore-tax and after-tax MARR and IRR can be approximated as follows:\n\n(Eq. 8)\nAfter-tax MARR = (1- Effective Income Tax Rate) (MARR)\n\n(Eq. 9)\nAfter tax IRR = (1 - Effective Income Tax Rate) (IRR)\n\nThe higher one's tax rate, the more important tax effects become. Tax effects are extremely important for certain\nkinds of investment decisions. For example, in the United States, tax laws allow state and local governments to sell\nbonds whose interest is not subject to federal tax. Investors who live in the state that issues such bonds will not have\nto pay any state tax on the interest received from such bonds. Suppose a group of investors are considering municipal\nbonds instead of buying an AA-rated corporate bond that pays 6% interest. Would these investors be willing to buy\na municipal bond offered by their local port authority that pays 4.0% interest? The investors agree that both bonds\nare very high quality, as they are rated double-A by bond-rating services. Some of the investors are in the 35% tax\nbracket, while others are in the 15% tax bracket; all of them pay 6% for state income taxes.\n\nFirst consider the high income investors. Their effective income tax rate is calculated as follows:\n\n(Eq. 10)\nEffective tax rate = 6% + 35%(1-.06) = 38.9%\n\nFor these investors, the 6% interest received from the corporate bond will be taxed at the effective rate of 38.9%, so\nthat they will only receive 6%*(1-0.389) = 3.67% interest after deducting federal and state taxes. They therefore would\nprefer the tax-free interest of 4% that they could obtain from buying the local bonds offered by the port authority.\n\nFor the lower income investors, the corporate bonds provide a better option, as these investors have a much lower\neffective tax rate:\n\n(Eq. 11)\nEffective tax rate = 6% + 15% (1-.06) = 20.1%\n\nTheir after-tax yield on the corporate bonds would therefore be 6% (1-.201) = 4.79%, which is well above the tax-free\nyield on the port authority's bond.\n\nThis example illustrates how the tax code can encourage certain investors to buy bonds to finance what legislators\nbelieve to be desirable projects. If the interest on municipal bonds were not deductible, then municipalities and states\nwould have to offer much higher interest rates to attract investors.\n\nAnother way to promote projects is to allow companies and individuals to reduce their income taxes by an amount\nequal to a specified percentage of qualified investments. Governments may offer tax credits in order to promote\ninvestment in certain kinds of activities, such as education, housing for the elderly, rail transportation, or alternative\nenergy programs. Legislation defines the type of expenditures that would qualify for the program and the amount of\nthe tax credit. Infrastructure programs can be promoted via an investment tax credit (ITC) that could be used to\nreduce taxes during the year of the investment. Since infrastructure will be depreciated over a life of many years, the\ninvestment tax credit can be a major boon to developers during the first year of their projects.\n\nFor example, suppose the federal government has decided to provide a 20% investment tax credit to promote\ninvestment in housing for low income families. If a developer were to construct such housing at a cost of $4 million,\nthen the tax credit would be $800,000. If the investment occurred in year 1, and if the company adjusted its estimated\ntax payments to reflect the tax credit, then the benefit would also be received during year 1, reducing the cost of the\nproject from $4 million to approximately $3.2 million. Of course, the tax credit is a benefit only if the company\nactually pays taxes that are at least as great as the credit. If the company only paid $200,000 per year in federal taxes,\nthen the tax credit would have to be taken over a period of 4 years. In this case, the tax credit would be very much\nlike an annuity of $200,000 per year for four years, and it would be worth considerably less than $800,000. Thus, the\ntax credit will be most valuable to profitable companies that will immediately be able to use the credit to reduce their\ncurrent taxes.\n\nThis example and the prior examples have illustrated how accounting rules and the tax code define what expenses can\nbe deducted from revenue in order to calculate income and what portion of income must be paid as income tax. In\nparticular, we have seen that rules related to depreciation can have a major impact on what will be considered to be\nprofit and what companies have to pay in taxes. Since depreciation is such an important policy tool, it is worth\nconsidering in some detail how depreciation and tax policy work together to affect projects. There are four things to\nconsider:\n\n-\nDepreciation converts investments into recurring expenses. The investment involves actual cash\nexpenditures (possibly using borrowed money) that are not deductible for income tax purposes, while\ndepreciation is a non-cash expense that is deductible.\n-\nAccelerated depreciation allows a business to increase depreciation during the early years of an asset's life.\nThis accounting change has the effect of reducing profits, but increasing cash flow.\n-\nDepreciation can be treated as an expense even if it is clear that the asset is actually increasing in value, as\nis often the case with buildings.\n-\nIf an asset is sold, the new owner can depreciate the asset again, using the purchase price as the initial book\nvalue and using a life and salvage value allowed by accounting rules and tax regulations.\n\nTable 2 shows the tax advantages of the three options for depreciating the asset that was included in Table 1 above.\nIt is assumed that the business's effective tax rate is 40% and that the business indeed has taxable income remaining\nwhichever method is used. For straight line depreciation, the annual tax benefits equal $120,000, which is 40% of the\nannual depreciation of $300,000. Over ten years, the tax benefit is $1.2 million, and the net present value of the tax\nbenefit, discounted at 10%, is $0.737 million. With the double declining balance method, the annual tax benefits are\ninitially much higher, but decline over the ten-year life of the asset. The total tax benefit is greater, with a NPV of\n$1.023 million. The third method provides even more tax benefits, as this method fully depreciates the asset (i.e. no\nsalvage value) and the NPV of the tax benefit is $1.096 million. The accelerated methods of computing depreciation\nthus could increase the value of this asset by $0.36 million - which is 9% of the initial construction cost. This is a\ngood reason for developers to be extremely interested in the nuances of the tax code!\n\nTable 2 Tax Benefits of Depreciating an Asset With Initial\nBook Value of $4 Million and a Life of Ten Years ($ millions)\n\nStraight Line\nDouble Declining Balance\nDouble Declining Balance\nReverting to Straight Line\nYear\nDepreciation\nTax Benefit\nDepreciation\nTax Benefit\nDepreciation\nTax Benefit\n$0.3 million\n$0.120\n$0.800\n$0.320\n$0.800\n$0.320\n$0.3 million\n$0.120\n$0.640\n$0.256\n$0.640\n$0.256\n$0.3 million\n$0.120\n$0.512\n$0.205\n$0.512\n$0.205\n$0.3 million\n$0.120\n$0.410\n$0.164\n$0.410\n$0.164\n$0.3 million\n$0.120\n$0.328\n$0.131\n$0.328\n$0.131\n$0.3 million\n$0.120\n$0.262\n$0.105\n$0.2621\n$0.105\n$0.3 million\n$0.120\n$0.210\n$0.084\n$0.2621\n$0.105\n$0.3 million\n$0.120\n$0.168\n$0.067\n$0.2621\n$0.105\n$0.3 million\n$0.120\n$0.134\n$0.054\n$0.2621\n$0.105\n$0.3 million\n$0.120\n$0.107\n$0.043\n$0.2621\n$0.105\nTotal\n\n$1.200\n$0.086\n$1.428\n\n$1.600\nNPV\n\n$0.737\n\n$1.023\n\n$1.096\n\nNow think about what would happen if the owner didn't have any taxable income. In that case, there would be no tax\nbenefit from the depreciation, however it was calculated. The owner in such a situation might consider selling the\nasset to someone who could use those tax benefits - and who would allow the seller to lease the building on a long-\nterm lease. Or, what is almost the same thing, the business would simply lease assets from companies that could get\ntax benefits from ownership and pass them on to the business in the form of low lease rates.\n\nLet's return to the situation where the owner does have plenty of taxable income and can therefore take advantage of\nthe tax benefits. In year 11, a change may be needed, as there will be no further tax benefits from the fully depreciated\nasset. The owner's taxes will therefore increase by $120,000 per year. This conceivably would be a good time to\nsell the asset (if it still has useful remaining life), so that someone else could capture tax benefits from a new process\nof depreciation.\n\nDepreciation is especially important in real estate, as buildings are very long-lived assets that can increase in value if\nthey are well-maintained or in a good location. If the building's cost can be covered by a mortgage, and if rents are\nsufficient to cover the mortgage payments and upkeep, then the tax advantages of depreciation could be very important\nto the financial structure of the project. For example, consider a skyscraper that is constructed at a cost of $450 million\nthat has a salvage value of $50 million. If this building is depreciated using straight line depreciation over 40 years,\nthen the depreciation would be $10 million per year and the tax advantage would be $4 million per year for a business\nwith an effective tax rate of 40%. For someone with a discount rate of 10%, this tax benefit would be worth\napproximately $4 million/0.10 = $40 million.\n\nIf a capital asset is sold, then the difference between the sale price and the depreciated basis for the asset will be treated\nby accountants and the tax collectors as a capital gain or loss.\n\n(Eq. 12)\nCapital Gain = Sale Price - Book Value\n\nThe accounting logic (or perhaps we should say the \"accounting fiction\") is that the value of the asset actually equals\nthe depreciated basis that is reported to the tax collector and to shareholders up until the moment that the asset is sold.\nAt the time of the sale, there is an instantaneous gain or loss in the value of the asset. Some assets, like automobiles,\nlose much of their value as soon as they are first put into service, so their depreciated basis will at first overstate the\nvalue of the asset. Other assets, notably real estate, not only depreciate less rapidly than assumed by the accounting\nrules, they are very likely to increase in value. Capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than income, so there\nis an advantage to companies and to individuals to receive cash payments as capital gains rather than as income.\n\nDepreciation therefore is an accounting technique that protects some cash receipts from being taxed as income, while\nallowing taxes on any increases in value to be deferred until the asset is sold - and then taxing the capital gain at a\nlower rate! For owners of real estate, who expect their properties to increase in value, the tax rules related to\ndepreciation and capital gains can be extremely favorable! From the public's perspective, the favorable treatment of\nreal estate may also be quite acceptable, either as a way to reduce the costs of providing rental housing or as a way to\nhelp attract investments in retail outlets, office buildings, and other businesses that provide jobs and increase regional\nincome.\n\nDepreciation, while important, is something that is typically governed by accounting standards and federal tax\nregulation, both of which are slow to change and neither of which is susceptible to manipulation by local governments.\nLocal governments therefore will be much more interested in the tax incentives that they control, namely local sales\ntaxes, local income taxes, and real estate taxes.\n\nLocal taxes can be used in two ways:\n\n-\nSpecific taxes can be targeted to specific projects, e.g. sales taxes are sometimes used to finance transit\nprojects.\n-\nReal estate taxes can be reduced in order to make certain kinds of development more attractive, e.g. a city\nmight encourage a manufacturer to locate a new plant by offering a reduced real estate tax rate for a period\nof years.\n\nAs was the case with depreciation and capital gains, the key consideration will be the effect of changes in tax laws on\nthe cash flows associated with potential projects. If taxes are increased in order to finance public projects, then the\npublic authorities must satisfy voters that the benefits of the proposed projects will be worth the increase in taxes.\nSpecific proposals will often be presented to voters in a referendum, and voters may decide whether or not to spend\nextra money to build schools, improve roads, construct bridges, or create a new sewerage system.\n\nTax deals designed to attract businesses or to encourage specific projects may or may not receive the same scrutiny,\nas it usually proves easier politically to provide tax breaks that promote a project than it is to raise taxes on voters in\norder to finance a project. Nevertheless, it is well worth considering whether the alleged economic benefits justify\nthe tax concessions that are used to attract development. Large national and international corporations will be able\nto encourage competition among regions and even countries, and they may eventually locate where local governments\nare willing to forego almost all taxation. It is possible - but not desirable - for local governments to forego tax\nrevenues even though they commit to considerable spending for local infrastructure and services related to the new\nproject (e.g. new roads, increased road maintenance, increased police protection, and general increases in education\nand other public services related to population growth).\n\nLand Use Regulations\n\nLocal governments can also affect development through zoning and other regulations related to land use. If there are\nno limitations on land use, then developers may attempt to construct whatever provides them the greatest financial\nbenefits. In some locations, this could be high-rise office buildings, while in other locations it might be new factories,\na fast-food restaurant, or a recycling facility. Some cities make little or no attempt to limit development, allowing\ndevelopers and land owners to do whatever they like with their land. In other locations, cities have elaborate plans\nthat are used to guide development, and different parts of the city are zoned for different types of development.\n\nRationales for zoning include the separation of incompatible land uses, protection of scenic or environmentally\nsensitive areas, preserving land for special uses, and limiting the density of development to preserve the aesthetic or\nsocial character of the community. Opponents of zoning may have little faith in the ability of planners to direct\ndevelopment, they may believe that land owners should be able to do whatever they want with their land, or they may\nfear that greed, politics, and corruption will overrule fairness and common sense in planning. It is beyond the scope\nof this essay to delve into the pros and cons for planning and zoning, but it is central to our text to understand how\nzoning and other land use regulations affect the value of land and the potential for projects.\n\nSince zoning can restrict the types of development that are allowed, it may prevent developers from building projects\nthat they believe would be the most profitable. If so, then landowners or developers may seek a zoning variance that\nwould allow them to undertake a different kind of project or a larger project. To secure a variance, whoever owns a\nplot of land may apply to the zoning board or whatever authority controls the land use regulations. If the land is re-\nzoned, then the more profitable project will be feasible, so the value of the land increases - perhaps very considerably.\nIf land formerly zoned for single-family houses on 1 acre lots is re-zoned to allow apartment buildings, then land\nvalues could double or triple. If the land is re-zoned to allow construction of a large mall, then a few acres of land\ncould suddenly rise in value from less than $100,000 per acre to $10 million or more!\n\nWhen public planning commissions must vote on whether or not to re-zone land for more lucrative developments,\nthere are obvious opportunities for political maneuvering, shady financial deals, double-dealing, and worse. Consider\nthe scandal associated with a proposal to create a colossal sports and gambling complex in the site of a defunct\nracecourse situated within a large public park near Dublin, Ireland. The gambling scheme failed, despite much\npolitical maneuvering, transfers of envelopes of cash, lavish \"corporate hospitality\" at football matches, and offers of\nlucrative consulting contracts to political opponents. The scheme failed because of well-organized opposition that\ngathered 20,000 signatures from local residents against the introduction of gambling into one of the wealthier suburbs\nof Dublin. The promoters of the scheme had no option but to sell the old racecourse to another group, developers\nFlynn and O'Flaherty, who followed local government's incentives that promoted construction of high-density\nhousing in locations served by Dublin's public transit system:\n\nFlynn and O'Flaherty set about having the racecourse rezoned for residential development ... [and] secured\nfull planning permission ... to roll out more than 2,300 new homes, along with an 18-acre public park and\nother community facilities including bars, restaurants, shops, creches and a primary school. In May 2004,\nwhen the first phase was launched, Flynn and O'Flaherty grossed 110 million pounds in one day and stood\nto make vastly more money from the Phoenix Park Racecourse than the bookies ever did in 90 years of\nracing,' as Jack Fagan put it in the times.\"2\n\nAmong the promoters of the original gambling scheme was Mr. Bertie Ahern, the Taoiseach of Ireland (Taoiseach is\nthe title for the prime minister of Ireland). After much public haggling over his involvement, which apparently\nincluded more than $1 million in dubious transfers to and from his bank accounts, Mr. Ahern announced his\nresignation on April 2, 2008, while still denying that he had received a corrupt payment.\n\n2 Frank McDonald and Kathy Sheridan, The Builders, Penguin Press, Dublin 2008pp. 54-58\n\nZoning restrictions may also limit the size or height of buildings or the location of buildings on a site. Washington\nDC and Paris are among the cities that do not allow skyscrapers to be built in the center of the city in order to preserve\nthe architectural integrity and prominence of their historic structures. New York City, after allowing hundreds of\nskyscrapers to be built in the lower portions of Manhattan Island, found that these immense structures could transform\nstreets into dark canyons. In order to prevent further crowding of the airspace, the city instituted zoning laws in 1916\nthat allowed buildings to be constructed right out to the sidewalks, but required setbacks as the buildings rose higher:\n\n\"On 25 percent of the plot, buildings could rise as high as technology and the will of the developer were\nwilling and able to take them. The law divided the city into zones that allowed buildings to rise a different\nmultiple of the width of the street before requiring a setback. In areas zoned for the most intensive use, ...\nbuildings could rise straight up from the building line two and a half times the width of the street before\nsetbacks were required. ... In some specialty zoned retail districts buildings could rise only one and a\nquarter times the street width, but in most of Manhattan buildings could rise one and a half times the width\nof the street.\" 3\n\nThe result was that the city could benefit from the density of skyscrapers without having huge buildings block all of\nthe light and air from reaching the street levels. Also, by allowing towers of any size on a quarter of the lot, this\nzoning allowed very tall buildings. The setbacks required by this zoning law were reflected in the design of the Empire\nState Building, the first 100-story building in the world.\n\nFigure 4 Typical Sidewalk View in Downtown\nVancouver, British Columbia: despite the prevalence\nof high-rise buildings, downtown Vancouver enthralls\nvisitors with numerous tiny parks, sculptures, and\nwaterfalls, which makes walking to and along the\nwaterfront a delightful way to pass a couple of hours.\n\nAnother approach to zoning is to limit the floor area ratio (FAR), which is the ratio of the sum of the total floor area\nof a building to the size of the site. A floor area ratio of 14, for example, would allow a 14-story building that covered\nthe entire lot or a 28-story building that covered half of the site. The same FAR would allow a mixture of buildings\non a site. For example, with the same FAR of 14, it would be possible to build a 40-story building on a quarter of the\nlot, a 6 story building on two thirds of the site, while leaving the remaining portion of the site as open space: 40 (1/4)\n+ 6 (2/3) = 14.\n\n3 John Tauranac, The Empire State Building: The Making of a Landmark, St. Martin's Griffin, New York, pp. 56-57\n\nIn suburban and rural locations, zoning is frequently used to limit the density of development by specifying a\nminimum lot size and limiting development to single-family residences for large portions of the region. The minimum\nlot size in a suburban location may be a quarter of an acre or less, while the minimum lot size in a rural location is\nsometimes set as high as five acres. These restrictions are certainly effective in limiting the total number of housing\nunits, but they may also lead to sprawl, i.e. to the conversion of large portions of farmland and open space to residential\nuses.\n\nA different approach to limiting density is known as cluster zoning, in which the density of development is still stated\nas the number of units per area, but the housing units (or other structures) can be clustered in a small portion of the\nsite, leaving large portions of the site as open space. Cluster zoning can be very effective in minimizing the\nenvironmental impact of development, not only because it leaves much of the site as open space, but because it allows\nutilities and transportation services to be more efficient, as people and houses will be closer together.\n\nBuilding codes and Other Safety Standards\n\nGovernments establish building codes in order to reduce the risks associated with structural failures, accidents, fire,\nfloods, earthquakes, and other natural or man-made hazards. Minimum standards for construction are needed to\nprotect people from unsafe or unsanitary conditions in their buildings. As building technologies change - and as\naccidents or natural disasters identify problems - building codes may be updated.\n\nExamples of regulations that are designed to reduce the risks of natural hazards would include the following:\n\n-\nDesign standards and inspection requirements for dams.\n-\nRequiring brick firewalls between attached structures in order to limit the possible spread of fire.\n-\nRequiring sprinkler systems and fire escapes for schools, apartment buildings, and office buildings.\n-\nHigher standards for structures constructed in earthquake zones.\n-\nProhibitions regarding the use of lead pipes, asbestos insulation, and other materials that are known to cause\nhealth problems.\n\nRegulations designed to improve safety would include:\n\n-\nThe use of nets and other precautions when constructing bridges and high rise buildings.\n-\nRequiring railings for steps on residential housing.\n-\nRequiring numerous safeguards for nuclear power plants.\n\nEnvironmental Regulations and Restrictions\n\nEnvironmental regulations may affect what, how, where and when something is built. Examples include:\n\n-\nMinimum setbacks from rivers, ponds, lakes, and wetlands\n-\nRestrictions on filling wetlands\n-\nRestrictions on development in flood plains\n-\nDesignation of areas as wilderness\n\nMinimum setbacks from water are desirable for several reasons. Maintaining a natural buffer will help to limit water\npollution resulting from runoff of rain water and allow a passage way for wildlife (Figure 5). In cities, pedestrian\naccess to waterways and bodies of water is an important consideration, and many cities have developed linear parks\nalong rivers, lakes or the ocean.\n\nFigure 5 The landscaping for this mall in Front Royal, Virginia features planting of trees\nand shrubs along the roads and parking lots and preservation of wetlands between the mall\nand the main access road from Interstate 66. Section 175-53.1 of the zoning code provides\nguidelines for development of \"Highway Corridors\" along the major entrances into the town\nand \"strives to ensure that such development is compatible in use, appearance, and functional\noperations with the Town's economic development policies and action strategies.\"\n\nRestrictions on filling wetlands recognize the importance of wetlands for many species of animals and plants as well\nas the ability of wetlands to act as a natural buffer for holding water following heavy rains or snow melt. When\nbuilding roads or other transportation routes, it will at times be necessary to cross wetlands, but there may be routes\nthat could be chosen that would limit the area of wetlands that would be filled in and there may be construction\ntechniques (e.g. use of bridges rather than a causeway) that limit the disruption to the wetland. It may also be possible\nto create new wetlands alongside the highways, so that the net impact of the highway construction could be mitigated\nin some locations.\n\nSome states have created a system that requires highway construction and other development projects to cover the\ncosts of preserving and protecting wetlands. When new roads are constructed, the state department of transportation\nis required to a) limit the destruction of wetlands, if possible, b) to create new wetlands, if feasible, and c) to make a\npayment into a special fund for any wetlands that are destroyed. A separate agency uses the money from this special\nfund to a) acquire and preserve wetlands elsewhere in the state and b) to create new wetlands in locations where that\nis desirable. This process can be structured so that the area of wetlands that is preserved is much greater than the\namount that is destroyed.\n\nIndividual landowners can also take action to limit future development by putting conservation easements on their\nproperty in order to limit future development. Easements may prohibit any development, or they may allow limited\ndevelopment such as the construction of a single house on a specified portion of the site. They may allow activities\nsuch as agriculture, forestry, sports (e.g. hiking or skiing), or they may require the land to remain in or revert to a wild\nstate. An easement is a legal document. When an owner puts a restrictive easement on property, the value of that\nproperty will decline. The decline in value can, in some instances, be considered to be a charitable donation, as some\nlegislation encourages landowners to provide easements aimed at preserving open space or protecting wildlife. The\ncharitable donation is an amount that can be deducted from income when calculating how much is owed in income\ntax, so there can be a financial benefit to an individual or a company for placing an easement on a property. The\namount of the deduction must be verified by qualified assessors who determine the value of the property with and\nwithout the easement, based upon recent sales of similar properties.\n\nSummary\n\nIncome tax is based upon net income, the difference between income and expense. Income taxes may be levied by\nlocal, state, or federal governments. Local and state taxes may be deductible from income when calculating federal\nincome tax. The effective tax rate combines the effects of local, state, and federal taxes. The after-tax MARR equals\nthe pre-tax MARR multiplied by one minus the effective tax rate. Since companies and investors are concerned with\nafter-tax cash flows, their decisions concerning where to invest, when to invest, and how much to invest may be\naffected by tax policy. For example, governments may allow tax credits to promote certain types of infrastructure\ninvestments.\n\nSince capital investment is not an expense, investment does not affect profit or income tax. However, capital assets\ndecline in value over their lifetime, and the depreciation in the value of capital assets can be treated as an expense.\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense that represents the actual or assumed decline in value of assets other than land,\nwhich cannot be depreciated).\n\nDepreciation, although it is a non-cash expense, will be deductible from income. Since depreciation can reduce\nincome tax payments, the rules governing depreciation will affect the perceived value of a project to investors. Tax\nlaws and accounting rules determine the methods that can be used to depreciate an asset. One commonly-used method\nis straight line depreciation, which assumes that a capital asset declines in value at a uniform rate over its life. Other\ncommonly-used methods include double-declining balance and asset class depreciation, both of which allow higher\nrates of depreciation during the early years of an asset's life. Accelerated depreciation results in lower profits, which\nmay seem undesirable, but it also results in lower taxes and an increase in the net present value of a project. Public\npolicy may therefore allow accelerated depreciation as a means of encouraging certain types of investments.\n\nZoning limits the type of development that can be undertaken in a city or town. Certain areas may be zoned for\nresidential, while others are zoned for commercial or industrial. Zoning may require a minimum lot size, designate\nhow close a building can be to property boundaries, or limit the maximum extent of development, e.g. by specifying\na maximum floor area ratio (FAR). Since the value of land is largely dependent upon the potential for development\nand the character of the surrounding areas, zoning may either enhance or depress land values. For example prohibiting\nobnoxious development within a residential neighborhood may increase the value of the homes in that area, but\nprohibiting more intensive development (e.g. apartment buildings or smaller lot sizes) may depress nearby land values.\n\nDevelopers often seek zoning variances in order to initiate more intensive or what they believe to be better (and\ncertainly more profitable) uses of the land. Where re-zoning would cause a dramatic increase in value - but equally\ndramatic changes in a neighborhood - there is potential for great local political conflict and controversy.\n\nLand owners may choose to accept restrictions on their own property by creating an easement. For example, an\neasement could allow a right-of-way (e.g. for power lines or for access to other properties), allow public access, or\nallow or prohibit certain uses of the land. Conservation easements are commonly used to promote preservation of\nopen space. Such easements may prohibit further development or allow only agricultural or forestry activities. If\nlandowners donate an easement on their property to a qualified charitable organization, then they can treat the assessed\nreduction in the property's value as a tax deduction.\n\nBuilding codes define what materials and methods can be used in construction, and they may mandate better\nconstruction techniques and materials in areas prone to natural hazards, especially earthquakes or flooding. Safety\nstandards may be part of building codes. For specialized facilities, such as nuclear power plants, safety standards may\nrequire great care (and great expense) in design, construction, and operation. As technology advances, the logic\nunderlying building codes and safety codes may need to be revised to allow cheaper or more effective methods and\ndesigns (e.g. plastic pipes for plumbing). As knowledge of environmental impacts and risks increases, building codes\nmay need to be revised to avoid dangers that were previously unknown (e.g. the use of asbestos for insulation is banned\nbecause this material is linked to lung cancer).\n\nEnvironmental regulations may affect what, how, where and when something is built. Examples include:\n\n-\nMinimum setbacks from rivers, ponds, lakes, and wetlands\n-\nRestrictions on filling wetlands\n-\nRestrictions on development in flood plains\n-\nDesignation of areas as wilderness\n\nLegislation or regulation may require infrastructure projects to mitigate their effects on the environment. For example,\ntransportation projects that disrupt wetlands may be required to pay money into a special fund that is used to protect\nor to create other wetlands.\n\nFigure 6 Pier A Redevelopment Project, Battery Park, Manhattan\nThe City of New York and the Battery Park City Authority are working with the NY City Economic Development\nCorporation to rehabilitate this historic Pier, which was constructed in the 1880s. The goals are enhance access to\nthe waterfront, create jobs, and produce economic benefits for the city.\n\nDealing With Risks and Uncertainties\n\nOur fundamental need is not the elucidation of the mysterious,\nbut an appreciation of the significance of the obvious.1\nIntroduction\n\nWhen infrastructure projects are planned, especially for new types of infrastructure, there will be many uncertainties\nconcerning operating performance, demand, profitability, environmental impacts, safety, and other social and\neconomic impacts. One approach to dealing with such uncertainties is to include contingencies when estimating the\ntime and costs that will be incurred, thereby having a buffer to deal with problems that may emerge. Perhaps past\nexperience with similar projects has reduced the uncertainty about a particular type of infrastructure project, so that\nproject managers have some confidence about what kinds of problems are likely to emerge and what can be done to\ndeal with them. Once a project has been completed, it will still be possible to make some adjustments to improve\nperformance and deal with unexpected side effects. However, it will always be wise to consider risks and uncertainties\nwhile evaluating alternative project designs, rather than waiting to find out what problems emerge after a new system\nis open for business.\n\nRisk and uncertainty are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are some differences worth mentioning. The term\n\"risk\" implies that something bad could happen, which might involve something physically bad (a building collapses)\nor something less tangible (mortgage markets dry up and financing for the project cannot be obtained at a reasonable\ninterest rate). The term \"uncertainty\" does not have the connotation of something that is bad; instead, it refers to the\ninability to predict exactly what will happen. Interest rates could go up or down; demand for apartments could go up\nor down; the costs of gasoline or building supplies could rise rapidly, slowly, or oscillate.\n\nCommon risks associated with any major project will include the following:\n\n-\nConstruction risks: it may not be possible to construct the project as planned, on budget, within the original\ntime schedule. Storms could cause extensive damage, and unexpected geotechnical problems could set\nback a project many months or years.\n-\nFinancial risks: it may not be possible to obtain sufficient funding for a project; interest rates on bonds,\nmortgages or loans may be much higher than anticipated; investors may demand a larger share of the\ncompany ownership or pull out of the project altogether; general economic conditions may decline sharply\nwhile the project is underway, possibly making it impossible to continue borrowing money to complete a\nproject.\n-\nInternational risks: if a project is undertaken in another country, exchange rates could change, thereby\nupsetting key assumptions about the value of cash flows. In some locations, there could be a risk that local\ngovernments will change the regulations governing the project, attempt to take over the project or fail to\nfollow through on commitments made to support the project.\n-\nInfrastructure safety: there will be risks of accidents both during construction and over the life of the\nproject. These risks could affect construction workers, operators, users, or abutters. Avoiding\ninfrastructure failure and reducing risks associated with operations and maintenance should be fundamental\ngoals of the engineering design process.\n-\nDemand risks: the revenue projected for a project may fail to materialize because of a lack of demand or\noverly optimistic assumptions about pricing.\n-\nOperating costs: the project might not work as well as planned; operations might be more costly and service\nmight not be as good as expected.\n\n1 John A. Droege, Freight Terminals and Trains, McGraw Hill, New York and London, 1925, p.13\n\nSome of these risks, such as the risk of being unable to complete the project on time, can be reduced by allowing\nbuffer time in the schedule and a significant amount for unexpected contingencies in the budget. Risks related to\nstorms can be reduced by developing emergency plans and by taking precautions at the building site. Safety risks can\nbe mitigated by testing materials, ensuring good design standards, and careful monitoring of all construction processes.\nRisks related to demand and operations can be handled by undertaking detailed studies of how the system will work\nand how potential users will respond to the system. Uncertainties in demand relate to the size and staging of projects\nand to the design of the project. Understanding how potential customers might respond to new infrastructure is\ntherefore an essential aspect of project design.\n\nExample: Dealing with Risks and Uncertainty in a Toll Road Project\n\nSuppose a city and a company have entered a public/private partnership to construct a new toll road. The city has\nallowed the company to charge a fixed toll during the first years of operation, with some ability to raise tolls every\nfew years thereafter. The city recognizes that demand will be lower in the first few years of operation, so it has agreed\nto provide a subsidy to supplement toll revenues for a period of several years. The city has also agreed to guarantee\nthe interest rate on the bonds issued by the company to pay for the construction costs. The company was created to\nconstruct and operate the toll road; its future depends upon the financial success of the project. What are the\nuncertainties and risks in this situation and what are the key issues to negotiate?\n\nThe major uncertainties are:\n\n-\nThe cost of construction, which will determine the annual interest rate on bonds\n-\nThe time required for construction, which will determine the point at which toll revenues begin\n-\nThe demand for the road\n\nThe major risks are:\n\n-\nIf the company does not receive enough revenue from tolls and subsidies to cover the interest costs, it will\nhave to declare bankruptcy and the city will have to take over the project.\n-\nIf the city has to pay too much for subsidies, then it will have to cut back on other projects or raise taxes,\nwhich will cause a political uproar.\n-\nIf tolls are set too high, and if the private company becomes very profitable, there could be a political backlash\nagainst the project and the ability for the city to undertake similar projects in the future would be jeopardized.\n\nThe key issues to negotiate are:\n\n-\nInitial levels for tolls: if set too low, public subsidies will be too high; if set too high, public outrage could\nbe a problem.\n-\nEscalation for tolls: if tolls are allowed to rise sooner, rather than later, then the private company may be\nable to borrow additional funds to cover losses in the initial years. The contract could require the company\nto establish a fund or a line of credit that would be sufficient to cover a shortfall of toll revenues during the\nfirst few years.\n-\nNature of the subsidy: if a maximum is established, then the company bears more risk related to the\nuncertainty in demand; if no maximum is established, then the city bears all of the risk related to the\nuncertainty in demand\n\nIf the city and the private company are careful in structuring the deal, then they should be able to reduce the risks that\nthey each face. If one party fails to recognize the major uncertainties, then they are likely to end up with more of the\nrisks.\n\nUsing Analysis to Understand Risks\n\nMore detailed methodologies can be used to gain a greater appreciation of the risks and uncertainties associated with\na project, including the following:\n\n-\nSensitivity analysis: sensitivity analysis can be used to find out which aspects of a project are likely to be\nmost critical.\n-\nModelling performance: infrastructure-based systems can be evaluated in terms of many measures,\nincluding cost, service, capacity, and safety, and projects may be aimed at improving any or all of these\naspects of performance. Given a well-structured model, it will be possible to investigate how a proposed\nproject might improve performance and how the improvement in performance might affect demand or\nprofitability of the system. Simulation or analytical models can be used to study many aspects of\nperformance, including cost, service, and capacity.\n-\nScenario analysis: the basic idea of scenario analysis is that potential projects should be considered in the\ncontext of various possible visions of the future, taking into account the political and social context as well\nas engineering, economic, and financial issues. In deciding whether or not to proceed with a project or how\nbest to proceed with it, it will be very helpful to consider multiple futures and to consider the different risks\nthat might be encountered in each of them.\n-\nProbabilistic risk assessment: this is a technique that can be used in developing strategies to improve the\nsafety of infrastructure systems by assigning probabilities to various types of accidents or incidents that\nmight be encountered and also considering the range of potential consequences of each type of accident or\nincident.\n-\nPerformance-based technology scanning: new technologies may reduce cost, improve operations, increase\ncapacity, enhance safety, or improve some other aspect of performance. Whether or not new technologies\nare worth pursuing will depend upon how potential customers or users will respond to the improvements in\nperformance provided by the new technologies.\n\nUsing Sensitivity Analysis to Study Uncertainties and Risks\n\nIt takes some thought and considerable care to conduct an intelligent sensitivity analysis and to interpret and present\nthe results of such an analysis. A good sensitivity analysis seeks to determine whether the success of the project is in\ndoubt, given the uncertainty in the various assumptions that must be made. By varying one variable at a time along a\nrange of possible values, it is possible to calculate the effect on return on investment (ROI), net present value (NPV)\nor any other measure of performance. By varying two or more variables, it is possible to see more complicated\ninteractions. The conclusions of a sensitivity analysis might be stated as follows:\n\n-\nAs long as construction costs are no more than 20% of budget and net revenues are at least 60% of what we\nexpect, the NPV of the project will be positive (a very strong statement that this would be a good project).\n-\nIf construction costs are 10% over budget or if incomes is only 90% of what we anticipate, then we will be\nunable to cover the interest payments on our mortgage (a very clear statement that this is a risky project)\n\nSensitivity analysis can be used to understand performance under various assumptions about the key factors related to\nproject success. By looking at many possible combinations of factors, it is possible to determine if there is a risk that\nthe project will fail, given the uncertainty in the assumptions related to supply and demand. However, sensitivity\nanalysis alone cannot provide much insight into the underlying engineering, economic, political or financial problems\nthat will affect the success or failure of a project.\n\nModeling Performance: Simulation and Analytical Models\n\nGreater insights into risks and uncertainties associated with a project can be gained by creating a model or models to\ninvestigate how well the project will perform under various sets of assumptions. Models can be simple or complex.\nA simple probabilistic model could be run dozens or hundreds of times to determine what the most likely performance\n\nwill be and the chance that performance will be unacceptable. Complex engineering-based models can examine\nfundamental issues related to design, maintenance, and operations. Planners can use simple models to investigate a\nwide range of design options, then use more detailed models to study a few promising options in much greater detail.\n\nWhatever the degree of complexity, models can be used to address three sets of questions related to project evaluation:\n\n1. How will system capabilities or performance change if the project is implemented?\n2. If system capabilities or performance change, what will happen to demand?\n3. How will uncertainties affect the success of the project?\n\nThe first set of questions refers to the engineering factors that underlie performance. How does the system currently\nfunction? What are the most important relationships? What are the key performance measures? What are the critical\nfactors that affect costs, capacity, or service quality? How will the proposed project affect these relationships,\nperformance measures, and factors? These are engineering questions that can be addressed with models appropriate\nto the system. For example, putting a portion of a light rail transit system into a tunnel can save travel time by\neliminating delays at grade crossings. Modeling the operation of the system may show that the travel time savings\nwould be 4 minutes, reducing the average time from 44 to 40 minutes. Another example might be an analysis of\nvarious designs for wind farms to determine which will be the most cost effective in producing electricity.\n\nThe second set of questions concerns what might happen after the project is implemented - what happens next? So\nwhat if the average travel time on the transit system is reduced by 10% or if the unit cost of producing electricity with\nwind turbines is reduced by 10%? Will most people still prefer to commute in their own cars? Will the cost of green\nelectricity be competitive with the cost of electricity from efficient gas-fired plants? The changes in performance may\nor may not result in any more people using the light rail system or in any increase in demand for electricity produced\nby wind turbines. To determine the effect on demand, it would be necessary to consider the factors that affect the\ndemand for transit and the willingness of customers to choose to use green energy even if is somewhat more costly.\n\nThe third set of questions considers the interaction among the key factors that determine the success of the project,\nwhich will include variables related to supply and demand as well as variables related to the financing of the project.\nWhat happens if costs are much greater than expected? What happens if performance does not improve as much as\nexpected? What happens if resource prices are much higher than anticipated or if new technologies reduce costs of\ncompeting projects?\n\nProbabilistic Risk Assessment\n\nProbabilistic risk assessment is a structured methodology for understanding and improving the safety of an\ninfrastructure system. This methodology defines risk as the product of two factors: the probability of an accident\nand the expected consequences if an accident occurs.2 Global risks associated with a particular system can be\nestimated by summing over all types of accidents and all types of consequences. Investments to reduce risk can be\ncompared by considering the ratio of the reduction in risk to the cost of achieving that reduction.\n\nThis methodology address the two aspects of risk assessment that will be critical for many projects. First, what is the\nmost effective way to reduce the risks that affect infrastructure safety? For example, what is the best way to reduce\nhighway accidents or the best way to reduce the risks of floods? Second, how can the risks associated with the safety\nof a project be best communicated to the public? For example, how does an energy company deal with public\nperceptions of the risks of nuclear energy? Both aspects of risk assessment relate to the way that people and society\nperceive risks and decide what risks are acceptable.\n\n2 Probabilistic risk assessment applies to studies related to safety, e.g. the likelihood of accidents that disrupt service and result in\nproperty damage, injuries, or fatalities. As mentioned above in this essay, there are many other kinds of risk to be considered, such\nas the risks associated with financial matters (currency exchange, interest rates) or demand (will demand meet initial projections?)\n\nClearly, individuals are quite willing to accept substantial risks in their everyday activities. Some people go skiing, a\nfew go sky-diving, kids ride down hills on their bikes, and many people like to ride their motorcycles. Despite the\nvast number of broken limbs associated with these activities, many people do seem quite willing to buy and use their\nskis, bikes, and motorcycles, even though many more prefer snowshoeing, walking, and jogging as less risky activities\nthat are more clearly attached to the ground. In general, people may at times decide to avoid activities that they view\nas too risky, while at other times they seek out activities where the excitement or the view or the sense of achievement\njustifies whatever risks are encountered.\n\nCollectively, people also are able to decide what kinds of risks are acceptable to society. In some cases, societies not\nonly condone, but promote activities that are well-known to be risky. Since more than 30,000 people are killed\nannually on highways in the United States, it is clear that driving is risky. Most of us know of someone who was\nkilled or severely injured in an automobile accident, and anyone who drives extensively is likely to be able to recount\nseveral close calls. Yet we do not limit access to highways; we do not post speeds of 30 mph to avoid high-impact\ncollisions; we seldom shut down the highways in snow storms; and we do not require construction of automobiles that\nresemble tanks in their ability to survive collisions. As a society, we do not \"do everything possible to save just one\nhuman life.\" As individuals, we each continue to drive, because the benefits of personal mobility outweigh whatever\nrisks we perceive in driving. Quite possibly many of us refuse to believe that we ourselves are at risk, just as many\nof us believe that the cost of driving is free, so long as there is gasoline in the tank. On the other hand, we do impose\nspeed limits; we do have design standards for highways and vehicles; we do punish drunken drivers; and we do require\nseatbelts. Some actions have been deemed worthwhile to pursue, while others have not.\n\nWhether or not the logic is stated explicitly by pubic officials, it is useful for us to understand how analysis can help\ndetermine what risks are acceptable and what values can be used to determine the costs and benefits of changes in\nsafety. The three key types of factors are as follows:\n\n-\nProbability of an accident (P)\n-\nConsequences of an accident (Ci)\n-\nRelative importance of the consequences (Wi)\n\nRisk can be defined as the sum of the expected consequences of an accident:\n\n(Eq. 1)\nRisk = P (Ci * Wi)\n\nIf the weights (Wi) are expressed in monetary terms, then changes in risk can be used in benefit/cost analysis. Given\nthe importance of reducing risks and public concerns with any major accident involving infrastructure, it is worth\nspending some thought on what it really means to reduce the expected consequences of an accident. The direct medical\ncosts associated with an accident can be estimated based upon past history, but what about serious injuries or fatalities?\nThere are many approaches to this issue. A strictly economic approach might consider the average lifetime earnings\nof an individual killed in an actual accident, but it is impossible to say who would have been involved in an accident\nthat is prevented. A possible solution to this problem would be to consider the age and income potential of the people\nusing the facility. For example, if the typical user is 35 years old, earning $50,000 per year for 30 more years, then\ntheir future earnings would be more than $1 million. This approach is fraught with difficulties: \"how can we put a\nvalue on a human life\" is a common refrain after any tragic accident, especially one involving children.\n\nAnother approach advocated by economists such as Ken Small would look not at the cost of a fatality but at the value\nof reducing the risks shared by all users. In trying to improve highway safety, this approach has the merit of focusing\non a benefit that is shared by everyone using the highways, rather than directing attention to an unknown victim of an\nunspecified accident. With this approach, the basic question is what would an individual pay to achieve a small\nreduction in risk? This question can be answered through detailed interviews with a cross-section of users. Studies\nhave found that people in the United States would be willing to pay a few dollars for a small reduction in the probability\nthat they would die in a transportation accident. If individuals are willing to pay on the order of $2.50 to reduce the\nodds of a fatal accident by 1 in a million, then it is logical to say that society should be willing to pay on the order of\n\n$2.50 million to avoid a single fatality in an accident. Instead of putting a value on a human life, this approach puts a\nvalue on the reduction in risk that is provided to every traveler.\n\nAnother approach would be to consider the damages awarded in lawsuits involving accidental death. And a much\ndifferent approach might just consider the need for a reasonable number to use in estimating benefits and costs for\npublic investments and public policy. If an extremely high value is placed on expected fatalities, then it will be\npossible to justify extreme measures to improve safety. If no consideration is given to safety, then it will be possible\nto construct facilities that are quite unsafe. A society, through political and legal processes, will determine acceptable\nlevels of risk and how much is worth investing in order to reduce risk.\n\nExample: Which Automobile Safety Features Are Most Worth Pursuing?\n\nProbabilistic risk assessment can be used to investigate the effectiveness of various strategies for reducing fatalities\nresulting from highway accidents. If the probability of a fatal accident is 1 in 100 million miles, and if the average\ncar is driven 10,000 miles per year, then the probability of a car being involved in a fatal accident would be 1 in 10\nthousand per year. Let's assume that the benefit to society of reducing risks so as to eliminate one fatality is $2.5\nmillion. The expected costs incurred from an average car being involved in a fatal accident would therefore be $250\n(0.0001 fatal accidents per average car per year multiplied by $2.5 million per fatality = $250/year). Consider three\npossible changes to reduce risk, each of which would increase the initial cost of the car:\n\n-\nRequire seat belts: an investment of $100 per car reduces the probability of a fatality by 50% (to 0.00005\nper year); risk would decline from $250 per year to $125/year, a benefit of $125 per year.\n-\nAirbags for driver and passenger: an investment of $500 per car further reduces risk of fatality by 80%\nbeyond what is possible with seat belts (to 0.0000125 per year); risk would drop from $125 per year to $25\nper year, a benefit of $100.\n-\nAutomatic collision avoidance system: an investment of $20,000 per car further reduces risk of fatality by\n10% beyond what is possible with seat belts and airbags (to 0.0000113); risk would drop from $25 per year\nto $22.50 per year, a savings of $2.50 per year.\n\nTo compare the risk reduction benefits to the costs of the systems, the additional investment costs must be converted\nto annual costs. With typical assumptions about financing automobile usage and financing, the annual costs of these\nthree options would be approximately $12 for seat belts, $60 for airbags, and $2,400 for the collision avoidance\nsystem.3 The reductions in annual risk per automobile would be $125 for the seatbelts, $100 for the airbags, and $10\nfor the automatic collision avoidance system. The seat belt and airbags are clearly justifiable, as the expected reduction\nin risk is far greater than the annual cost. The hypothetical collision avoidance system, which would cost an additional\n$2,400 per year, would provide an additional benefit of only $2.50 per year in risk reduction compared to a car\nequipped with seat belts and airbags. Therefore, it would be better to spend additional money not on automatic\ncollision avoidance systems, but on some other means of reducing risk on the road or in our lives.\n\nGlobal Risks\n\nGlobal risk encompasses all of the risks associated with the many types of accidents that could occur within a system.\nA company or agency should be interested in understanding global risk in order to be able to develop effective\nprograms for mitigating overall risk. Without a clear understanding of overall risk, it is quite likely that too much will\nbe spent to avoid what in fact are minor risks while too little will be spent to avoid what are actually major risks.\n\nEstimating global risk for an infrastructure-based system involves the following steps:\n\n-\nIdentifying the types of accidents that might occur on each portion of the system\n\n3 The cost of each option was converted to an equivalent annual cost assuming a 14 year life for the car and a discount rate of 8%\nfor the owner.\n\n-\nEstimating the probabilities of such accidents as a function of time or usage\n-\nEstimating the expected consequences of each type of accident\n-\nCalculating the risks associated with each type of accident by multiplying the probability of an accident by\nthe expected consequences of an accident\n-\nSumming risks over all type of accidents\n\nThese steps can be carried out at various levels of detail. For a well-established system, estimates of accident\nprobabilities and consequences can be based upon past experience. For new systems, risk estimates will have to be\nderived from models, comparison with similar systems, or expert opinion.\n\nDifferent types of risks will have to be considered:\n\n-\nRisks related to construction\n-\nRisks inherent in normal operations\n-\nRisks related to maintenance and rehabilitation\n-\nRisks related to deteriorating infrastructure\n-\nRisks related to structural failure\n-\nRisks related to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes or tornadoes\n\nSome risks are associated with potentially catastrophic accidents that could result in hundreds of fatalities, extensive\ndisruptions in major cities, and extreme property damage. Examples of catastrophic accidents would include the\nfailure of a major bridge, collapse of a building, flooding of a major city, an explosion in a chemical plant, failure of\na nuclear power plant, or a plane crash. Many aspects of system design, operating strategies, and inspection and\nmaintenance policies are aimed at avoiding catastrophic accidents, and the probabilities of such accidents are therefore\nlikely to be very small. Nevertheless, because the potential consequences are very large, the risks associated with\ncatastrophic accidents are likely to be an important component of global risk for any system.\n\nTable 1 illustrates some of the major risk factors that might be associated with three hypothetical projects. Using these\nfactors, it is readily possible to estimate the fatalities that could be anticipated over the 100-year lifetime of the projects.\nThe table shows the expected fatalities associated with construction, normal operation, and structural failure. The\nfirst project is the construction of a major canal, assuming technology and medical knowledge available at the time of\nthe construction of the Panama Canal. The greatest risks are those associated with the construction process, as a very\nlarge work force is necessary and past experience suggests a death rate of 5%. The canal would involve some risk in\noperation and maintenance, but there are not that many people who would be working at the canal on a daily basis,\nand there would be minimal risk in the event of a major structural failure. Thus, for the canal, the global risks are\nprimarily associated with the construction, not with operation.\n\nThe second project is the construction of a skyscraper, using rough estimates of risks assuming only modest attention\nto safety during construction. There is some risk inherent in construction, as many workers will be working high off\nthe ground. However, with nets and other safety procedures in place, there should not be many fatalities during\nconstruction. Operations of a skyscraper should also be very safe, but it would surely be catastrophic if the building\ncollapsed. The greatest concern for this project is therefore to ensure the structural integrity of the building. The third\nproject is the construction of an urban highway that is expected to serve 100,000 vehicles per day. With this project,\nthe risks in construction can be mitigated through use of proper safety procedures, but there will be a continuing risk\nassociated with traffic accidents. The failure of a portion of the highway would surely attract national attention, but\nthe nature of a highway is such that failure is unlikely to affect more than a few dozen vehicles. The greatest challenge\nis therefore to improve the safety of the highway.\n\nTable 1 Risk Factors for Three Hypothetical Systems\n\nMajor Canal\nSkyscraper\nUrban highway\nRisk of fatality per\nconstruction worker\n0.05\n0.001\n0.001\nConstruction workers\n20,000\n1,000\n1,000\nRisk of fatality per user,\nnormal operation\n0.2 per million\n0.02 per million\n2 per million trips\nUsers per year\n1 million\n3 million\n30 million\nDaily usage\n40 ships per day\n3,000 occupants\n100,000 vehicles/day\nPotential fatalities from\nstructural failure\n2,000\nLikelihood of failure in 100\nyears\n0.01\n0.01\n0.01\nExpected fatalities\n\n-\nConstruction (total)\n1,000\n-\nOperations (per\nyear)\n0.2/year or\n20 in 100 years\n0.06/year or\n6 in 100 years\n60/year or\n6,000 in 100 years\n-\nFailure (life of\nproject)\n1 in 100 years\n20 in 100 years\n1 in 100 years\n\nEstimating global risks is an objective exercise that is limited only by the ability to envision the types of accidents that\nmight be expected and the ability to estimate the consequences of those accidents. Once the risks are understood, it\nis possible to determine which risks are most serious and to consider how best to mitigate those risks. However, it\nwould be a mistake to believe that risks can be dealt with objectively, without regard to the way that people perceive\nand respond to risk. As discussed in the next section, some risks are perceived to be much worse than others, so that\nit is necessary to consider perceptions when assessing risks.\n\nPerceived Risks4\n\nEstimating \"perceived risks\" requires more than the assessment of accident probabilities and expected consequences.\nAdjustments are needed to reflect the perceived importance of certain types of accidents or consequences to various\nstakeholders, including users and the public. Quantifying perceived risks requires answers to questions such as \"Who\nis at fault?\" \"Is it a catastrophic accident?\" and \"Is new technology involved.\" In principle, it is possible to answer\nthese questions based upon surveys, and researchers have created a framework for understanding how perceptions of\nrisk vary with the circumstances related to particular types of accidents.5\n\nOne of the first studies of perceived risks found that there is a different trade-off between risks and benefits for\nactivities undertaken voluntarily than for those undertaken involuntarily6. People will accept risks from voluntary\nactivities (such as skiing) that are roughly 1000 times as great as they would tolerate from involuntary hazards that\nprovide the same level of benefits7. This study concluded that the acceptability of risk from an activity is roughly\nproportional to the third power of the benefits for that activity.\n\n4 The material in this section is largely based upon a report prepared for the East Japan Railway Company: C.D. Martland, J.M.\nSussman, L. Guillaud, and J. Vanzo, \"Risk Assessment: Improving Confidence in JR East, Final Report, Research Conducted for\nthe East Japan Railways, MIT Engineering Systems Division, Cambridge, MA, March 2005\n5 For an excellent overview of the fundamental research on risk perception, see Nancy Nighswonger Kraus, \"Taxonomic Analysis\nof Perceived Risk: Modeling the Perceptions of Individuals and Representing Local Hazard Sets\", Thesis Ph. D, 1985, University\nof Pittsburgh.\n6 Starr, C. (1969), \"Social benefit versus technological risk\", Science, 165, 1232-1238.\n7 Paul Slovic, \"Perception of Risk\", Science, Vol. 236, 17 April 1987.\n\nAdditional research on perceived risk identified other factors that affect perceptions of risk. Slovic, Fischhoff and\nLichtenstein (1979) compiled from their own and prior studies a list of nine characteristics of risk that might be\nimportant in risk ratings by the public: 8\n\n(1) Whether the risk is assumed voluntarily or involuntarily\n(2) Whether the risk of death is immediate or delayed\n(3) Whether the risk is known or not to those exposed to it\n(4) Whether it is known by science or not\n(5) Whether the risk can be controlled by an individual's skill\n(6) Whether the risk is new and unfamiliar as opposed to old and familiar\n(7) Whether the fatalities are common or catastrophic accident\n(8) Whether or not the thought of the risk evokes a feeling of dread\n(9) Whether or not there is a risk of a fatal accident.\n\nSlovic, Fischhoff and Lichtenstein found strong intercorrelations among these nine characteristics and suggested that\nthe risk perceptions could be explained in terms of two basic factors (see Figure 1). The factor labeled \"dread risk\" is\ndefined at its high end by a perceived lack of control, feelings of dread at the nature of an accident, and potential for\na catastrophe. Factor 2, labeled \"\"unknown vs. known\", is defined at its high end by hazards judged to be\nunobservable, unknown, new and delayed in their manifestation of harm. Research has shown that lay people's risk\nperceptions and attitudes are closely related to the position of hazards within this type of factor space9. Most important\nis the horizontal factor \"dread risk\" The more a hazard is perceived to be \"dreadful\", the more people wanted to see\nits risks reduced, and the more they wanted to see strict regulation employed to achieve the desired reduction in risk.\n\nFigure 1 Reducing Various Characteristics Relevant to Risk Perceptions to Two Key Factors\n\nSource : P. Slovic, B. Fischhoff, S. Lichtenstein, \"Perilous Progress: Managing the Hazards of Technology\",\n(Westview, Boulder, CO, 1985), p. 91-125.\n\n8 P. Slovic, B. Fischhoff, S. Lichtenstein, \"Perilous Progress: Managing the Hazards of Technology\", (Westview, Boulder, CO,\n1985), p. 91-125\n9 Paul Slovic, \"Perception of Risk,\" Science, Vol. 236, 17 April 1987.\nFactor 2 : Unknown Risk\nNot observable\nUnknown to those exposed\nEffect Delayed\nNew risk\nRisk unknown to science\nObservable\nKnown to those exposed\nEffect immediate\nOld risk\nRisk known to science\nFactor 1 : Dread Risk\nDread\nGlobal Catastrophic\nConsequences fatal\nNot Equitable\nCatastrophic\nHigh risk to future generations\nNot easily reduced\nInvoluntary\nControllable\nNot dread\nNot Global Catastrophic\nConsequences not fatal\nEquitable\nIndividual\nLow risk to future generations\nEasily reduced\nVoluntary\n\nFigure 2 shows how people viewed eight hazards, including some related to daily activities, some related to new\ntechnology, and some related to infrastructure. The least dreadful risk was that associated with caffeine - we know it\nisn't all that good for us, but we still have to wake up in the morning! Likewise skiing might get you a broken leg,\nbut that risk is not viewed as dreadful. The most dreadful risks for the people in this survey were those associated\nwith nuclear reactors and radioactive wastes - which goes a long way toward explaining the difficulty of expanding\nthe use of nuclear power in the U.S. and in many other countries. The other scale goes from known to unknown. The\nrisks of automobile accidents are well known because they are so common; we continue to drive despite the risks\nbecause we often would rather be somewhere else - to meet with friends, to go to work, to take a trip, or to go shopping.\nWe know the risks, and we accept them. The other end of the scale includes the risks associated with new or unusual\ntechnologies. The risks associated with nuclear reactors and nuclear waste are rather high on this scale as well: we\ndon't know how bad the risks really are, but we know we don't like them. DNA technology, which relates to issues\nsuch as genetic alterations to increase agricultural yields, is the least known risk and therefore one of the most feared.\n\nFigure 2 Location of Eight Hazards within the Two-Factor Space\n\nAdapted from: P. Slovic, B. Fischhoff, S. Lichtenstein, in \"Perilous Progress:\nManaging the Hazards of Technology\", (Westview, Boulder, CO, 1985) p 91-125.\n\nThere are various strategies for dealing with perceived risks. One is to provide more and more safeguards so as to\nconvince the public that the risks are well under control. The problem with this approach is that a rational response\nmay do little to ease what is likely to be in large part an emotional problem. Moreover, the public may just not believe\nthe technicians who claim that everything will work as planned. A second approach is to provide information\nconcerning the plans that have been put in place to deal with incidents, however unlikely they may appear to be. By\ndiscussing the risks and how they are being handled, a company or an agency may be able to assuage public fears or\nto at least provide an impression of competence. A third approach is to involve the public in the design and\nimplementation of a comprehensive and credible risk management plan.\n\nAnother, more general approach, is to make sure that risks are put in the proper perspective. None of us live in a risk\nfree environment. We could be involved in a serious automobile accident; we could be hit by a car when crossing the\nstreet; we could be hit by lightning or slip on the ice or trip over a chair when rushing to answer the phone. Our house\ncould be hit by a tornado, or we might be caught in a flood. We could be mugged, shot, or blown up in a terrorist act\n- which unfortunately has become a real day-to-day risk in most countries. Hence, it may be reasonable to consider\nthe extent to which the risks associated with new activities increase our overall exposure to risk and the extent to\nwhich the risks associated with a new project relate to the overall risks experienced by society.\nNuclear reactor\nid\nDNA Technology\nRadioactive Waste\nAuto Accident\nUnknown Risk\nDread Risk\nCaffeine\nRailroads\nSkiing\nX Rays\n\nA study conducted for the East Japan Railway addressed a very specific question concerning perceived risks: to what\nextent should the consequences of catastrophic accidents be weighted more heavily in developing a risk management\nprogram for the railroad? This was a very practical question concerning the allocation of JR East' s research budget\nand the amounts of money that should be spent on improving the protection at grade crossings in relation to the money\nspent on earthquake warning systems or installing collision avoidance systems for trains. The initial assessment of\nrisks simply determined the expected fatalities per year from all kinds of accidents, which in effect weighted 100\nfatalities in a train collision the same as 100 fatalities in 100 separate grade crossing accidents. However, the review\nof the literature cited above indicated that the public - you and me - really are more fearful of catastrophic accidents,\nespecially those related to new technologies. The conclusion was that JR East should indeed spend proportionately\nmore to avoid catastrophic accidents.\n\nIndirect Consequences of an Accident or Incident\n\nAn accident or incident may result in a greater awareness of risks, which then leads to changes such as enforcing\nproper operations of the system (e.g. enforcing speed limits on highways), improving the infrastructure (e.g.\nretrofitting buildings and bridges so they will be better able to survive in an earthquake), or installing surveillance\naimed at limiting deliberate attacks on the system (e.g. metal detectors at airports or procedures that limit public access\nto buildings). If these changes are indeed cost effective, then there will actually an improvement in the expected\nperformance of the system relative to what was in place before the accident. Operating or equipment costs may indeed\nhave gone up, but risks will have declined. What has changed is the understanding of the risks, which has resulted in\nrational decisions to reduce those risks. In this case, there would not be any indirect costs associated with the changes\nin operations, equipment, or regulation.\n\nHowever, a very rational approach may be difficult in the turmoil following a catastrophic accident. People - system\nmanagers, government officials, passengers, and the public - all want to do something to prevent a similar accident.\nIn what may become a highly emotional environment, there may be pressure to make changes that do seem to address\nthe immediate problem, but that would not satisfy a cost-effectiveness test. Three types of improper reactions might\nbe encountered:\n\n-\n\"Over-reaction\": an accident or incident could result in changes that really are not related to or that go far\nbeyond the specific causes of the accident or incident.\n-\n\"Irrelevant reaction\": the proposed changes might in fact have little or no impact on risk.\n-\n\"Ineffective or counter-productive reaction\": the proposed changes might increase risks or reduce the risk,\nbut at only at a very high cost. Greater reductions in risk would have been gained by investing in other types\nof problems or other types of solutions.\n\nImproper reaction leads to extra costs to the infrastructure operator and to society that would not have been incurred\nif there had not been a catastrophic accident. These costs are excessive, because they are above what could be justified\nusing the standard probabilistic risk assessment approach. On the other hand, effective response to a disaster may\ngive a company or an agency credibility with the public, thereby allowing a more rational approach to risk management\n- and to project design and evaluation.\n\nUsing Accident Statistics to Determine Causality\n\nWhenever there is an accident (or an identifiable incident that could have led to an accident), there is an opportunity\nto collect data concerning the conditions at the time of the accident, the factors that led to the accident, and the\nconsequences of the accident. This data can be used to learn more about the causes of accidents, which will be helpful\nin devising policies and technologies to reduce the number or the severity of accidents.\n\nThree types of analysis are feasible:\n\n-\nAnalysis of data from thousands of accidents to understand the most important causal factors: this approach\ncan be used for studying automobile accidents, because there are hundreds of thousands of accidents per year\nand there are well-defined policies for filing accident reports.\n-\nIntensive analysis of each major accident in order to identify causality: this approach is used for accidents\ninvolving airlines, railways, and other transportation companies where any accident can be catastrophic.\n-\nStatistical analysis of a representative sample of accidents: this approach can provide more accurate and\nmore in-depth documentation of the factors related to the accident in order to understand the sequence of\nevents and factors that lead to an accident.\n\nIf you are involved in an automobile accident, you are required to fill out an accident report that describes what\nhappened, when it happened, and who was involved. If the accident is serious, then police will conduct their own\ninvestigation and file their report. The data from such reports is entered into a data base in order to allow statistical\nassessment of the causes of accidents. Data for hundreds or thousands of accidents can be used to determine how\naccident frequency varies by time of day, age of the driver, weather conditions, type and age of car, type and condition\nof road, and other factors. This data can be combined with other information about traffic volumes and the\ncharacteristics of licensed drivers to obtain estimates of accident rates, which could be measured as the number of\naccidents per million miles driven. This type of analysis shows that risks are higher for new drivers, very old drivers,\ndrivers using cell phones, drunk drivers, drivers who speed, and drivers and passengers who do not wear seat belts.\n\nKnowledge of these risks has led to public policies aimed at reducing the number or severity of accidents:\n\n-\nPolicies aimed at new drivers: requirements for driver training, restrictions on initial driver's license (limits\nrelated to time of day and number of passengers), and programs that increase public awareness of risks faced\nby new drivers.\n-\nPolicies aimed at very old drivers: eye tests for renewal of licenses; programs that increase public awareness\nof risks faced by old drivers (which may help older drivers realize that they need to limit or stop their driving);\nresearch to develop new technologies to enhance visibility or to reduce reaction time of older drivers.\n-\nPolicies aimed at reducing drunk driving: suspension or loss of license; public awareness programs; highly\npublicized extra enforcement on major holiday weekends.\n-\nPolicies aimed at reducing the severity of accidents: requiring seat belts and airbags; construction standards\nfor cars; requiring helmets for motorcyclists.\n-\nPolicies aimed at improving the design of highways: limiting access to highways; minimizing curves;\nrequiring wider lanes; eliminating dangerous intersections; improving sight distances by clearing vegetation;\nimproving signage.\n\nDetailed Analysis of a Few Major Accidents\n\nIt is also possible to conduct very detailed analysis of particular accidents or incidents in order to determine causality.\nSuch investigations will be undertaken by company and government officials for any dam failure, any incident at a\nnuclear power plant, airline crashes, rail collisions and any other accident or incident that led to or could have led to\na catastrophe. The results of the investigation may highlight problems with design, operations, maintenance, personnel\ntraining, weather or other factors. A single accident or incident may result in new regulations, new designs for\nequipment, inspection of an entire fleet of airplanes, or new training practices.\n\nThe standard accident report submitted does not provide extensive information about the condition of the vehicle or\nthe driver and may have incomplete, confusing or inconsistent accounts of the accident. If the drivers and witnesses\ncan be interviewed soon after the accident, it will be possible to learn more about not just what happened, but why it\nhappened. If the driver works for a transportation company, then there may also be records that indicate how long the\ndriver had been on duty and how often the driver had been driving in the past several days.\n\nPerformance-Based Technology Scanning\n\nA project may be completed on time, within budget, and with no serious accidents, yet still be unsuccessful. The\nproject may fail to operate as intended or, more likely, the actual demand for the project may be much less than\nexpected. To minimize the financial risks associated with building projects that too few will use, it is essential to\nthink about how people will respond to the project long before the design is finalized. The usefulness of the project\nand the ultimate demand for the project will be based, not upon the technical difficulties of its construction or the\npersonalities of the leading characters promoting the project, but upon the actual changes in system performance made\npossible by the project. It is well to consider whether or not the proposed improvements in performance will really\nbe sufficient to attract enough users and supporters who will be willing to pay enough to cover the costs of construction\nand operations. It is not necessary to know how to build a bridge in order to begin thinking about the potential benefits\nif the bridge were built. Likewise it is not necessary to know how to make pure drinking water more widely available\nin developing countries in order to estimate the health benefits that could be achieved.\n\nThe process of deciding what kinds of projects might be most useful is similar to the process of deciding what\ntechnologies might be most useful. If new technologies are to be adopted, whether the technologies involve\nelectronics, bio-engineering or stronger materials, a series of projects will be needed to implement those technologies.\nMethodologies that have been used to determine which new technologies might be most useful turn out to be\napplicable in deciding what types of projects might be most useful. This section therefore introduces concepts broadly\nreferred to as technology scanning.\n\nThe goal of technology scanning is to identify and evaluate new and emerging technologies that are potentially\nimportant to an industry, its competitors and its customers. Performance-Based Technology Scanning (PBTS) is a\nmethodology for identifying areas where new technologies can have greatest performance benefits over the next 20-\n30 years in terms of reducing costs, increasing market share, and achieving higher profitability.10 New technologies,\nhowever exciting, are germane only if a) the technologies lead to significant improvements in system performance\n(speed, safety, cost, ease of use, etc.) and b) those performance improvements are indeed important for users of a\nsystem. Effective technology scanning can help an industry identify new technological approaches, formulate a\nbroader yet better focused R&D program, and improve its investment strategies. A superficial technology scanning\nprogram will readily identify exciting technologies, but it can be distracted and diverted into finding high-tech\nsolutions for minor problems rather than seeking technological assistance in dealing with fundamental problems. A\nbalanced technology scanning program should consider how technology can help meet customer needs and overcome\nfundamental operating constraints.\n\nTable 2 shows the range of possible technology scanning activities as they might apply to companies or industries or\nagencies that manage or develop infrastructure systems. At the broadest level of technology scanning, there is a\n\"General Search for Technologies\". This search is of necessity somewhat unstructured, as it is not initially clear what\nnew and emerging technologies will be available or what relevance they will have for the industry. This search should\ninvolve people with varied backgrounds and different working contexts, so that the search is truly broad. The three\nintermediate activities provide ways to narrow the technology scan from the \"general search for technologies\" to the\n\"analysis of specific technologies\".\n\n\"Technology Mapping\" is the most general of these activities, since it predicts the effects of hypothetical technological\nchanges in order to find the most important technological constraints on system performance. This activity, for\nexample, might consider the relative advantages and disadvantages of increasing capacity, reducing costs by enabling\nmore efficient operations, increasing the life of major system components by introducing more effective maintenance\nor inspection technologies, enhancing safety or security. Technology mapping begins with a base case that illustrates\nperformance of a representative portion of the system. Next, high-level models predict performance for particular\ntypes of services as a function of technological capabilities, using inputs that capture the desired or anticipated results\nof deploying new technologies on each aspect of performance. Separate sets of models can be developed to predict\n\n10 Martland, C.D. \"Performance-Based Technology Scanning Applied to Containerizable Freight Traffic,\" Journal of the\nTransportation Research Forum, Vol.57, No. 2, Spring 2003, pp. 119-134\n\nthe performance of typical types of systems at sufficient detail to provide realistic performance data and to capture the\nmajor competitive issues for different market segments.\n\nSystems modeling is a more detailed activity. The objective here is to estimate the effects of particular technological\nimprovements on system capabilities and performance. This is where very detailed engineering models could be\nuseful.\n\nTable 2 Performance-Based Technology Scanning\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nGeneral Search for Technologies\nConduct a very broad review of new and emerging technologies that might be beneficial to the system.\nTechnology Mapping\nConduct structured investigations into the performance capabilities of the system and identify the points of\nleverage for technological developments related to cost, reliability, safety, or capacity of the system and any\ncompeting systems.\nSystems Modeling\nDevelop and maintain a set of models that can be used to evaluate technological improvements as they affect\nspecific aspects of systems performance.\nCustomer Requirements Analysis\nInvestigate the requirements of selected groups of customers or users and identify how new technologies\nmight enable new ways of doing business; estimate the benefits to customers that will result from\nimprovements in cost, speed, reliability, safety or capacity.\nAnalysis of Specific Technologies\nExamine specific technologies identified as having potential for improving system performance.\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nCustomer requirements analysis can also be carried out at various levels of detail. There are several basic questions.\nHow will a particular group of customers respond to potential changes in price, service, safety or capacity? What\nconstraints, if any, limit the amount of services that will be purchased by these customers? How important are\nimprovements in equipment design as opposed to improvements in trip times and reliability?\n\nFinally, at the most detailed level of technology scanning, there is a need for analysis of specific technologies to\ndemonstrate that a particular technology is indeed suited for the industry. Care is required in selecting technologies\nfor this expensive stage of technology scanning.\n\nThe overall process is called \"Performance-Based Technology Scanning (PBTS)\". It includes consideration of the\nbasic technologies, but also investigates how technologies translate first into better technological performance and\nthen into better system performance in terms of the competitive market environment. The best technologies will\nrelieve constraints that currently limit competitiveness. Using PBTS, it is not only possible to find new technologies,\nbut also to identify gaps in an existing research program or to rearrange investment priorities in order to achieve more\nrapid implementation of the most effective technologies.\n\nSummary\n\nProject evaluation requires careful examination of both risks and uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis can help identify\nkey variables, but more detailed methodologies are needed to understand risks and uncertainties related to\nengineering issues and the public's response to new technologies and new projects.\n\nSimulation and Analytical Models\n\nModels can be very useful in providing insight into the performance of a system, the likely effect of a project, or the\namount of risk associated with a project. Models can be used to explore three key questions:\n\n1. How will system capabilities or performance change if the project is implemented?\n2. If system capabilities or performance change, what will happen to demand?\n3. How will uncertainties affect the success of the project?\n\nModels can be simple or complex, depending upon the stage of the analysis and the nature of the issues being\ninvestigated. Deterministic or probabilistic models can be developed, and even quite simple models can be helpful in\ndetermining the key factors affecting the success or failure of a project. By treating key factors such as project cost\nor demand as random variables, it is possible to see how the expected variations in these factors might interact and to\nestimate the likelihood that a project will or will not succeed.\n\nProbabilistic Risk Assessment\n\nProbabilistic risk assessment is a structured methodology for understanding risk, perceptions of risk, and how best to\nallocate resources for reducing risk. Any infrastructure-based system can experience accidents resulting from poor\ndesign, structural failure, bad weather, earthquakes, mismanagement, human error in operations, or other causes. The\nrisk associated with any type of accident is defined to be the probability of an accident multiplied by the expected\nconsequences of an accident. There are many possible consequences of an accident, including property damage, minor\ninjuries, serious injuries and fatalities. If weights are applied to each type of consequence, it is possible to come up\nwith a single measure of risk. The weights may be stated in monetary terms, in which case the weight can be interpreted\nas the value of a unit reduction in each type of risk.\n\nResearch into human behavior has shown that people are especially concerned with risks associated with unknown\nfactors or catastrophic accidents. People apparently believe that more care should be taken to reduce the risks\nassociated with potentially catastrophic accidents, such as a melt-down at a nuclear power plants or a chemical\nexplosion than is necessary to be taken with respect to well known, but non-catastrophic accidents, such as occur on\nski slopes or highways.\n\nRisks can be summed for different types of accidents and different locations. Global risk of a system is the summation\nof the risks of all types of accidents over all locations within the system. Projects may increase some risks while\nreducing other types of risk. The increases or decreases in risk can be treated as costs or benefits of a project.\n\nPublic perceptions of risks are likely to differ from what engineers and risk experts calculate to be the risks. A highly\npublicized catastrophic accident - or even an apparently minor incident that could have been catastrophic - may cause\npublic uproar and outrage. In the immediate aftermath of such an accident or incident, there could be extreme pressure\nfor public action to ensure that such an accident \"never happens again\". Such a response could be an over-reaction\nthat goes beyond the specific cause of the actual accident, an irrelevant reaction that has little or no impact on risk, or\nan ineffective reaction that may reduce risk, but only at an excessive cost. Infrastructure managers can reduce the\nlikelihood of such improper responses by understanding the risks associated with their system, adopting and\npublicizing a risk management program, and responding quickly and effectively to any accidents or incidents that may\noccur.\n\nStudies can be undertaken to increase the understanding of risks and thereby guide the selection of projects that will\nbe most cost effective in reducing risks. For accidents that are common, such as highway accidents, it is possible to\nassemble a data base with basic information on every significant accident. The data base can then be used to support\nstatistical analysis regarding accident causes or severity. For accidents that are rare and potentially catastrophic, such\nas those involving a power plant or a plane crash, every accident should be studied in great detail in order to determine\nwhether there are previously unknown risks that need to be addressed. In a special study, it is possible to identify the\ncritical event that led to each accident, the critical cause that precipitated the critical event, and the factors that were\nmost likely to be associated with serious accidents. By understanding the causal chain that led to the accident and by\nisolating the most important associated factors, it is possible to formulate a strategy for reducing the risks of this type\nof accident, including recommendations for changes in design of new facilities or projects that will correct deficiencies\nin existing facilities.\n\nPerformance-Based Technology Scanning (PBTS)\n\nMany projects involve the introduction of new technologies or the modification of an existing system in response to\ncompetitors' introduction of new technologies. Technology scanning refers to the search for new technologies that\nmight be important to a particular industry. PBTS is a structured approach to technology scanning that focuses on the\nway the technology might affect system performance rather than on the details of the technology. In using this\nmethodology, a technology can be represented as an option that has particular cost characteristics (e.g. investment\ncost, operating cost, lead time required for implementation) and performance impacts (e.g. reduction in operating cost,\nincrease in capacity or improvement in level of service.) It is even possible to consider a range of hypothetical\ntechnologies with various cost and performance characteristics. Whether or not the technologies are useful will depend\non a market analysis: will the changes in performance attract new demand? How will the new services be priced?\nHow will competitors respond? Answering these question may require a great deal of analysis - but not necessarily\nany great detail concerning the technology. Methodologies developed for PBTS are readily useful for evaluating\npotential projects.\n\nCase Study\nAn Engineering-Based Service Function for Bus Operations\n\nThis case study shows how a transit agency might develop an engineering-based service function that\nit could use to evaluate options for improving transit service. Using such a service function, the agency\ncould determine how much service would improve for various operating and investment strategies. The\ncost effectiveness could be measured by comparing the improvements in service to the cost of the\ninvestments. By considering cost-effectiveness, the transit agency could determine whether it would be\nbest to improve the existing services or to extend these services. They might conclude that the most\ncost-effective approach would be to increase bus frequency - but they might also eventually decide that\nthey could not afford to do so.\n\nCommuters in large cities usually have a choice of driving or taking transit. Public officials advocate greater use of\ntransit as a way to reduce highway congestion, improve air quality, and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\nHowever, commuters will only take transit if they perceive the cost and service levels to be acceptable in comparison\nto driving. Transit agencies therefore need to understand how long it will take commuters to get from home to work\nif they decide to take the bus; if the transit agency can provide better service, then perhaps it can attract more riders.\nWhat is needed is an engineering-based service function that can predict trip time for a commuter based upon existing\nor potential transit schedules.\n\nAny commuter's journey to work can be divided into individual segments. For example, one commuter's transit\njourney might include the following:\n\n-\nWalk to bus stop (5 minutes)\n-\nWait for bus, which operates every 10 minutes (0-10 minutes)\n-\nRide bus 2 miles to subway station (5-10 minutes)\n-\nTransfer from bus to subway platform (3 minutes)\n-\nWait for subway train, which operates every 5 minutes (0-5 minutes)\n-\nRide train 3 miles to destination, with five stops (12-15 minutes)\n-\nExit station and walk to destination (7 minutes)\n\nThe total trip could take as little as 36 minutes, if the connections are perfect and there are no delays on the bus or the\nsubway. On the other hand, if the commuter just misses the bus and also just misses the train, and if there are delays\nfor both the bus and the train, then the journey could take 55 minutes. The average trip is likely to be about 45 minutes.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks taking this route, the commuter would know when to leave home in order to be on time for a\nmeeting and when to leave home in order to experience the least delay. The commuter relies on experience and does\nnot require an engineering-based service function.\n\nThe transit agency, however, has designed the bus routes, built the subway system, determined how many stops to\nmake along the bus routes, and established schedule frequencies. They also have extensive experience in travel time\nalong the bus routes and the time required at bus stops and at subway stations. They therefore can develop equations\nthat could be used to predict service for any commuter under any set of operating conditions and any assumptions\nabout future bus routes and subway extensions. They also know, from census data and surveys, where people live and\nwhere the jobs are. They can therefore select a representative sample of commuters and calculate the following for\neach of them:\n\n-\nAccess to the system\no\nIf distance from home to subway is less than 0.25 miles, assume the commuter will walk to the\nsubway at an average speed of 3 miles per hour.\n\no\nIf distance from home to subway is more than 0.25 miles, assume that the commuter will take a bus\nif there is a bus stop within 0.25 miles; the time to walk can be estimated assuming an average speed\nof 3 miles per hour.\no\nIf there is neither a subway station nor a bus stop within 0.25 miles, assume that the commuter will\ndrive to work.\n\n-\nWait for bus (assume to be between 0 and the average time between buses during rush hour)\n-\nRide bus to subway station (estimate time based upon observed travel times, scheduled frequency of stops,\nand time required for stops along route)\n-\nTransfer from bus to subway platform (estimate based upon distance from bus to platform, expected\ncongestion at stairways or escalators, and time required to purchase ticket)\n-\nWait for subway train (assume to be between 0 and the average time between trains during rush hour)\n-\nRide train to destination (estimate time based upon distance, speed limits, train acceleration and braking\ncapabilities, number of stops, and time required for loading and unloading at each station)\n-\nExit station and walk to destination (estimate based upon distance and walking speed)\n-\nSum all of the times to determine the minimum, expected, and maximum travel times for each user.\n\nThis is an engineering-based service function because it provides a way to predict trip times and reliability as functions\nof engineering parameters, operating strategies, and network design. This process could be used to estimate the\nchanges in service, for particular groups of people, that would result from increasing the frequency of bus service,\nadding bus routes, creating an express-bus lane, or expanding the subway system.\n\nFigure 1 Reliable, frequent bus service in England's Lake District\nVisitors can leave their cars at home, take the train to Windermere, and connect to buses that offer\nfrequent, reliable service throughout the entire Lake District. The views of the mountains and\nlakes are more important than speed.\n\nCase Study\nCapacity of a Highway Intersection\n\nThis case study explores the capacity of a highway intersection in order to illustrate the\ndifferences among maximum capacity, operating capacity and sustainable capacity.\n\nConsider a typical intersection of two arterial streets in an urban area, one of which carries eastbound and westbound\ntraffic, while the other street carries northbound and southbound traffic. To simplify the situation, assume that a) all\nof the vehicles are automobiles, b) none of the vehicles are making any turns, and c) there are no pedestrians. The\ntraffic signal has a cycle time of 120 seconds, and it provides equal time (60 seconds each) for the east/west and the\nnorth/south flows. When the signal turns green, it takes 2 seconds for the first car to move through the intersection;\nif there is a queue of cars, then additional cars can pass through every 2 seconds. Thus, the maximum number of cars\nin one lane that can move through the intersection in each two-minute cycle is:\n\n(60 seconds green/cycle)/(2 seconds/car) = 30 cars/cycle\n\nIf both roads are two-lane roads, then there would be a total of 4 lanes that approach the intersection and there could\nbe as many as 4 lanes multiplied by 30 vehicles per lane or 120 vehicles moving through the intersection during each\ntwo-minute cycle, and there could on average be one vehicle per second moving through the intersection.\n\nIs the capacity of this intersection therefore one vehicle per second or 60 vehicles per minute? If so, is this the same\nas saying that the capacity is 60 vehicles per minute or 3600 vehicles per hour or 24 hours/day (3600 vehicles/hr) =\n86,400 per day?\n\nGiven the assumptions, these may appear to be reasonable statements. However, we probably should be somewhat\nsuspicious of the nice round numbers used in the above analysis. If you really want to know the capacity of the\nintersection, you could stand on the corner and count cars. If you had a stopwatch and a clipboard, you could record\nthe actual number of cars moving through on each cycle and you perhaps would find that sometimes the first car takes\n4-5 seconds (until the driver behind honks), while subsequent cars take a little more than two seconds. With better\ninformation about how cars move through the intersection you would be able to say something like this: the maximum\nnumber of cars passing through the intersection at rush hour during one week in October was 56; the average number\nof cars passing through the intersection was 52. Moreover, you noted that there was never enough time for all of the\nwaiting cars to get through in one cycle, so that these observations were directly related to the capacity of the\ninterchange. Armed with this knowledge, you might conclude that capacity was somewhat less than 60 cars per\nminute. And you might wonder whether the capacity should be stated as 60 (which is what was calculated using the\ntextbook approach described above), 56 (the maximum that you yourself saw) or 52 (the average that you observed)?\n\nBefore answering this question, let's think about how this measure of capacity might be used. If we are traffic\nengineers or planners, we likely would be comparing the capacity of the intersection to the volume of traffic that is\nexpected to be trying to get through the intersection; if capacity is insufficient, we would then be considering whether\nit is worthwhile to expand capacity or to reduce demand (e.g. by establishing tolls or by promoting the use of transit).\nIf we are commuters, we are likely worried about excessive delays if there is insufficient capacity. Engineers, planners,\nand commuters would all be thinking about the extent of the delays, and they would all be concerned with what\nhappens during the morning and afternoon rush hours. Thus, they would be thinking about cars per hour rather than\ncars/minute. While all might agree that the theoretical capacity is somewhere between 56 and 60, they would all\nprefer to use no more than the observed average of 52 in their comparison of capacity to demand.\n\nIs there any reason to consider something less than 52 cars/minute as the estimate of capacity? Yes, indeed. Any\nexperienced commuter would have some questions about the study that you completed:\n\n-\nWere there any accidents during that week?\n-\nWhat was the weather like (were there any heavy rains or snowstorms)?\n-\nWere there any emergency vehicles trying to move through the intersection?\n-\nWas there any maintenance in or near the intersection?\n-\nWas the intersection ever gridlocked (i.e. did cars ever enter the intersection without being able to continue\nall the way through, thereby blocking the intersection when the light turned green for the other traffic)?\n\nCommuters ask these questions because they know that accidents, bad weather, emergency vehicles, and aggressive\ndrivers all disrupt normal flows, not necessarily every day but often enough to be a problem. A more extensive study\nthat included winter conditions and periods of maintenance might show that the average flow through the intersection\nwas actually only 48 cars per minute during rush hour.\n\nSo is the capacity of the interchange 48 cars per minute? Well, the commuters and the planners would ask another\nquestion: how bad are the delays at this intersection? It could be that this is a notorious intersection where cars back\nup for a half-mile or more and it often takes 10-15 minutes to get through. Anyone driving that route on a regular\nbasis would say that such delays are unacceptable, and planners would likely agree that the intersection was\nexperiencing traffic volumes that were higher than its capacity. This may seem to suggest that the capacity is less\nthan 48 cars per minute, but actually it doesn't. The capacity of the intersection is in fact about 48 cars per minute,\nbut traffic volumes during rush hour are greater than this; the long queues build up because cars arrive faster than cars\ncan get through the intersection. When an incident happens, whether related to an accident or to a snow-storm or to\nanything else, fewer cars move through the intersection and queues build up to an unacceptable level.\n\nA traffic engineer might then ask the following question: if the average throughput of the intersection is 48 cars/minute\nduring rush hour, what is the maximum traffic volume for which the performance of the intersection is acceptable?\nThis question could be phrased in terms of the structure of the street network: what is the maximum traffic volume\nfor which the queues at this intersection will interfere with the performance of neighboring intersections no more than\nonce or twice a month? This question could be answered using algebraic models or by simulating traffic conditions.\nIf a delay of a few minutes is acceptable, then it will certainly be possible for more than 48 cars/minute to be arriving\nduring rush hour even though only 48 cars/minute will get through the intersection.\n\nThe discussion thus far has only considered rush hour, and the estimates of capacity all related to what happens during\nrush hour. In designing systems, it is essential to consider capacity during the peak period, but estimates of demand\nmay be phrased in terms of daily, weekly, monthly or annual usage. It is therefore necessary to be able to translate\npeak period capacity into capacity for these other periods. This can be done by considering the pattern of demand\nover longer periods. For highways, the following relationships can be estimated based upon observations of traffic\nvolumes:\n\n-\nAverage vehicles per day on week days over an entire year\n-\n% of traffic on weekdays\n-\n% of traffic during peak periods of the day\n\nFor example, if the capacity of an intersection is 50 vehicles/minute during rush hour, then the capacity for the four\npeak hours will be 12,000 vehicles during four peak hours. If the rush hour periods account for 40% of weekday\ntraffic, then the intersection can be considered to have capacity for 12,000/0.40 = 30,000 vehicles per weekday. If\nweekdays have 80% of the average weekly traffic, then the capacity is 30,000 vehicles per weekday x 5\nweekdays/week / 0.80 = 187,500 vehicles per week or 9.375 million per year, assuming that the current traffic patterns\nremain the same. This statement can be interpreted as follows: if traffic along these two roads rises to 9.4 million\nper year, then this particular intersection is likely to experience unacceptable delays on a regular basis. The\nintersection might actually handle more traffic, but the delays would increase and the congested rush hour periods\nwould be longer. In other words, this intersection is expected to act as a bottleneck once traffic along these two roads\nrises to 9.4 million vehicles per year.\n\nThe capacity of the network will be harder to define, because there will be many possible bottlenecks. There may be\nsevere problems at other points in the network long before our intersection experiences significant delays. If it is easy\nto add capacity, then it may be possible to add capacity as demand grows, thereby avoiding the development of\nbottlenecks.\n\nIf there are many potential bottlenecks within the network, then fixing one of them will not necessarily affect system\nperformance. Increasing the capacity of one intersection by building an overpass may simply shift the delays to the\nnext intersection.\n\nCase Study\nCanal Projects in the Early 19th Century\n\nBefore the invention of railroads, canals offered the most cost-effective alternative to shipping\nfreight by horse-drawn carts along poorly maintained gravel roads. This case develops\nengineering-based cost and service functions for both modes of transportation in order to examine\nwhether or not an investment in canals was likely to be attractive to potential users and therefore\nprofitable for potential investors.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCanals were among the first major civil engineering projects in the United States, as in many other countries. Until\nrailroads were invented, land transportation was cumbersome, slow, and expensive. Water transportation - when\navailable - was much cheaper, more reliable, and provided the only means of handling large volumes of freight, which\nof course was why cities grew up at the best harbors and along the major navigable rivers. The first canals simply\nbypassed rapids so as to avoid costly transshipment of goods. Later canals linked major cities to their hinterlands.\nThe early canals were designed with a tow path on either side so that a horse or a team of horses could pull the canal\nboats along the canal (Figure 1). The average speed would be only 2-3 miles per hour, and the distance traveled per\nday would only be 20-30 miles. More ambitious projects, such as the Erie Canal, sought to open up western regions\nand thereby promote development (not to mention the importance of the port city whose citizens promoted the project).\n\nCanals must be close to level to allow safe, easy movement in both directions. To create a level route in uneven\ntopography, it is necessary to construct locks. A lock is a chamber with two sets of gates. The water level is higher\non one side of the lock than it is on the other side. By opening one gate at a time, it is possible to adjust the water\nlevel within the chamber to match either the high side or the low side. The depth of the lock must be sufficient to\naccommodate canal boats when the water is low; the height of the gates above the low water level limits the extent of\nthe lift that can be achieved by one lock. Several locks can be operated next to each other or in close proximity to\neach other if the terrain requires more lift than can be achieved with a single lock. The time required for a move\nthrough a lock includes the time to position the canal boat (or boats) in the lock, the time required to raise or lower\nthe water, and the time required for the boat(s) to move out of the lock.\n\nTow Path\nTow Path\nFigure 1 Cross-section of a typical 19th century canal.\nThe canal would be barely wide and deep enough to allow two small boats to pass. The\nboats would be towed by a horse that walked along the tow path next to the canal.\n\nFigure 2 Remnants of the C&O\nCanal\ncan\nstill\nbe\nseen\nin\nGeorgetown in the District of\nColombia. Note the long narrow\nshape of the boat, which is sized to\nsqueeze into the locks, such as the\none at the back of this picture.\n\nThe width and depth of a canal and the size of the locks determine the size of the boats that can use the canal. Figure\n2 shows a lock on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington D.C. Note that\nthe lock is much narrower than the canal, and it has a lift of less than 10 feet. There is only one channel in this location,\nbut if more capacity were required a second lock could have been built right next to this one.\n\nThe deeper and wider the canal, the more material that must be excavated and the more expensive the project (Figure\n3). The larger the locks, the more expensive they become and the more water that is required to operate the system.\nHence, there are fundamental design issues concerning the size of the canal and the type of boats that will be\naccommodated. The canal must either be wide enough for two boats or provide periodic basins where opposing boats\ncan pass. It must also be deep enough to provide the required draft for the largest boats that are allowed to use the\ncanal. Some of the early canals could only handle small boats with a capacity on the order of 15 tons; these boats\nrequired a draft of only twelve inches when loaded. Larger canals could handle larger boats, e.g. boats that could\ncarry 75 tons along canals providing more than four feet of draft. As suggested by Figure 3, increasing the width and\ndepth of a canal can require massive excavations in hilly regions.\n\nFigure 3 Topography has a large effect on\nthe costs of constructing a canal.\nExcavation Costs Increase With\nthe Size of the Canal\n\nDoubling the width and depth of the canal\ncan lead to major increases in excavation\n\nThe number of locks required is a function of the route and the size of the locks. The topography of the route\ndetermines the minimum lift that will be required, which is the difference in elevation between the beginning and end\nof the canal. If a canal is constructed to connect two river basins, then the canal will have to either cut through the\nintervening hills or move up, across, and down the other side in a series of locks (Figure 4). Excavating a level route\nreduces the number of locks that will be required, which will also reduce the time required to move along the canal.\nHowever, it may be infeasible or extremely expensive to create a level route.\n\nFigure 4 Locks enable canal boats to move up and over hills\nLocks Reduce Excavation, But\nReduce Speed & Capacity\nLocks\nAvoided Excavation\n\nEach time a boat moves up stream through a lock, the lock fills with water; when a boat moves downstream, the lock\nis emptied. If a canal is to move from one watershed to another, there must be a reliable water supply in order to\nsupport the functioning of the locks (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5 A water supply is needed above the highest\npoint of the canal in order to supply the water\nnecessary to operate the locks.\nLocks\nLake or reservoir\nA. Horizontal Alignment\nB. Vertical Alignment\n\nService and Capacity of a Canal\n\nCustomers who might use the canal to move freight would be concerned with two aspects of service: the time that it\nwould take to move along the canal and the maximum size for a canal boat. First let's consider the time that it would\ntake to complete a 120-mile trip along a nineteenth century canal. We can assume that boats could tie up for the night\nat either end of the canal or at frequent locations along the length of the canal (as shown in the photo of Regent's\nCanal in Figure 6). At two miles per hour, a 120-mile trip would require 60 hours of travel time, which would be six\nten-hour days; at three miles per hour, the same trip would require only 40 hours of travel, or four ten-hour days. Thus\n\na reasonable estimate of the travel time could be stated as \"five days plus or minus a day\" or \"less than a week\". This\nmay strike you as a fairly imprecise estimate, but before worrying too much about how to refine it, think about what\nelse goes into the travel time. First of all, there are likely to be locks located every few miles along the canal, and it\nwill take an hour or two to get through each lock, perhaps much longer if the canal is very busy and there are queues\nof boats waiting to get through the busiest locks. If the 120-mile trip has 40 locks, then the time spent in the locks\ncould well be 40-80 hours, which is as long as and more variable than the travel time along the canal. There is also\nthe possibility that bad weather, high or low water, lock maintenance, or other problems will limit or prohibit travel\nalong the canal. Thus, the estimate that it will take about 50 hours to travel along the canal between locks is probably\nthe most reliable portion of the overall estimate of travel time. Adding in locks and considering the possibility of\nmajor weather-related delays, the trip would likely be estimated as a journey of \"two to three weeks\".\n\nFigure 6 Regent's Canal, London\nEngland's canals remain busy, but the old\ncanal boats have been converted to house\nboats suitable form mobile homes or for\nweekend get-aways. Dozens of boats may tie\nup for the night at a convenient and\npicturesque spot such as this.\n\nThe capacity of a canal (maximum throughput measured in tons of cargo) can be estimated for various time periods\nand conditions:\n\n-\nA peak day with twelve hours of operation\n-\nA peak summer month with twelve hours operation, seven days/week\n-\nA year, with operations ceasing during the winter and during major storms.\n\nThe canal's capacity will be a function of the characteristics of the canal, the boats, and the operating characteristics.\nThe maximum capacity of the lock is the inverse of the function of the cycle time for the lock. If the cycle time is a\nhalf hour per boat, then the maximum capacity is two boats per hour. The operating capacity, expressed in boats per\nday, will be limited by the hours of operation. If the lock operates twelve hours per day, then the operating capacity\nwould be 24 boats per day. The sustainable monthly capacity would be further reduced to allow time for maintenance,\nto allow for periods of slower or interrupted operations during bad weather, and to allow for smooth functioning of\nthe canal despite the normal variations in traffic and the routine delays that might occur. For example, the lock might\nbe closed for one day per month for routine maintenance, heavy rains or winds might reduce capacity by 50% for\nseveral days per month, and miscellaneous delays might amount to an hour or so each day. This would reduce\nsustainable monthly capacity as follows:\n\n-\nDays per month: 30\n-\nDays required for maintenance: 1\n-\nExpected days of operating at 50% capacity: 3-4 days, which is equivalent to 1-2 days of lost operation\n-\nMiscellaneous delays: about 1 hour per day or 30 hours per month, which is equivalent to about 4 days per\nmonth\n\n-\nNet days available for normal operation per month: 30 - 1 - 2 - 4 = 23 days\n\nThus the sustainable capacity would be no more than 75% of the operating capacity. A further reduction in sustainable\ncapacity might be necessary based upon traffic patterns and service requirements. For example, traffic volumes might\nbe much higher during the middle of the day and much lower on weekends, and users of the canal might expect at\nmost modest delays during normal operations (i.e. delays related to maintenance or bad weather may be acceptable,\nbut extensive delays related to congestion may be viewed as unacceptable). These considerations would reduce\nsustainable monthly capacity to less than 70% of operating capacity:\n\n-\nWeekend days per month: 8-10 days, with perhaps traffic at 50% of normal volume, which is equivalent to\n4-5 days of normal operation or about 15% of monthly capacity.\n-\nPeak patterns of traffic: the lock must be functioning reasonably well during these peak periods, so there\nwill be unused capacity the rest of the day. If peak period totals only 6 hours per day, then there will be idle\ncapacity the rest of the day. If the off-peak volume is 50% of the peak volume, then the maximum daily\ncapacity under normal operations and normal service levels will be only 75% of the operating capacity\n(100% for 6 hours and 50% for 6 hours produces an average utilization of 75% for the entire 12 hours).\n\nIf you consider these two factors along together, there will be a further reduction in capacity:\n\n-\nOperating Capacity: 24 boats per day through the lock\n-\nSustainable capacity, without considering traffic patterns: 70% of operating capacity\n-\nAdjustment for traffic patterns:\no\nWeekends: 15% reduction\no\nWeekday peaks: 25% reduction\n-\nSustainable capacity, taking into account traffic patterns: if these factors are considered to be independent,\nthe sustainable capacity will drop to less than half of the operating capacity: (0.70)(0.85)(0.75) = 45% of\noperating capacity, or 11 boats per day.\n\nHowever, there is certainly some overlap among these various factors. Storms may occur on weekends, and if they\ndo, then they will not disrupt operations as much as if they occur on weekdays. Providing capacity for acceptable\nservice during peak periods may also make it easier to schedule routine maintenance during slow periods of the day\nor the weekends. Miscellaneous delays that occur during off-peak times will not seriously affect capacity. The\nestimate of sustainable capacity is therefore perhaps 50-60% of the operating capacity or 12-15 boats per day or 360\nto 450 boats per month.\n\nIs this an acceptable estimate? Do we really believe all of these assumptions? Wasn't that just hand waving and\nmagical thinking when the sustainable capacity was increased from the calculated 45% to a rather broad range of 50-\n60% of the operating capacity? The answer to all of these questions may be \"maybe\"! We could study canals in much\ngreater detail in order to refine the assumptions, and we could develop simulation models to look much more closely\nat the effects of traffic patterns on service levels. However, rather than spending a lot of effort trying to answer these\nquestions about methodology, let's look at several more aspects of capacity, namely the loads carried on each canal\nboat, the ability to operate throughout the year and the ability to adjust operations as needed to keep up with demand.\nPerhaps the estimate of sustainable capacity is acceptable as it is.\n\nFirst of all, the size of the average load is very important. The maximum capacity measured in tons/day could be\nbased upon the size of the largest boat that could use the canal. So, if the canal could be used by boats that carry 15\ntons, then the maximum capacity would be 24 boats/day x 15 tons/boat = 360 tons/day. If the largest boat could carry\n50 tons/day, then the maximum capacity would be 1200 tons/day. In either case, the average load - and therefore the\noperational capacity - would be considerably less than the maximum load, especially if some of the boats only carry\nloads in one direction. If the average load were estimated to be 11-12 tons/boat, that would be a reduction of 20-25%\nin capacity measured in terms of tons/day - and another reason for being somewhat imprecise in our measure of\ncapacity.\n\nWeather is an even larger factor. Canals are unusable when the water levels are too high or too low or when they are\nfrozen over. Depending upon the climate, periods of inoperability could last for months or half the year, and these\nperiods could vary greatly from one year to the next. If weather shuts down the canal for three months, then annual\ncapacity would be reduced by 25%; if weather shuts down the canal for four months, then annual capacity would be\nreduced by 33%. There could easily be a 5-10% variation in annual capacity depending upon the weather.\n\nFinally, the users and operator perhaps have considerable options regarding operating and pricing policies. All of the\nabove estimates assumed operations of twelve hours per day. Is this a credible constraint? Would it not be possible\nto add some extra hours of operation during the peak season? And couldn't some of the off-peak capacity be utilized\nby reducing lock fees for these periods in order to promote somewhat different usage patterns?\n\nHold on! These are too many questions for this stage of the analysis! What can we conclude with some certainty?\nWe think that the locks on the canal can probably handle close to 24 boats/day when things are going well, but that\nthey may not be able to handle even half that much on a sustainable basis because of a variety of potential problems.\nWe also think that the canal will be able to operate for about eight months of the year. If we take ten boats per day as\nthe sustainable capacity, that would be 150 tons/day and 36,000 tons in eight months. We know this is a rather fuzzy\nnumber, but perhaps it will be sufficient. Now let's turn to costs and competition. Will there be a market for the\ncanal?\n\nCanal Competitiveness\n\nWhen canals competed with horse-drawn wagons, they had a marked advantage in cost, as illustrated by the immediate\nsuccess of the Middlesex Canal when it opened for operations between New Hampshire and Boston in 1803:\n\n\"The advantages of canal travel over wagon transport were obvious at once. One horse, for example, could\neasily draw 25 tons of coal on the canal. On land the same horse could pull only 1 ton. One team of oxen\ncould pull 100 tons, an amount that would take eighty teams on land. In the first eight months of the canal's\noperation, 9,405 tons were carried at a cost of $13,371. The cost for such a shipment by land would have\nbeen $53,484.\"\nDaniel L. Schodek, \"Landmarks in American Civil Engineering\",\nMIT Press, p. 12\n\nThese estimates of operating cost for this 27-mile canal can easily be converted to the cost/ton-mile of transporting\nfreight by canal boat or by wagon. Expressing cost as the cost per ton-mile is useful because that allows a normalized\ncomparison among different modes of transportation, different lengths of haul, and different time periods. Assuming\nthat all of the 9,405 tons were transported the entire length of the canal, the cost per ton-mile of using the canal was\n$13,371/(27 miles x 9,405 tons) = $0.056 per ton-mile. If the distance by road was also 27 miles, then the cost of\nusing a wagon was four time as large: $53,484/(27 miles x 9,405 tons) = $0.21 per ton-mile. These numbers are very\ninteresting because they are considerably larger than the costs of transporting freight along the inland waterways and\nhighways in the 21st century! Transporting coal on the inland waterways or on railroads now costs less than $0.02 per\nton-mile, while the cost of truck transportation is well under $0.10 per ton-mile (and a penny in 1803 was worth a\nwhole lot more than a penny is now worth 200 years later!)\n\nEngineering-Based Cost Model for a Canal\n\nKnowing the cost/ton-mile is interesting historically, and it is a useful indicator that customers or managers might use.\nBeing able to estimate the cost/ton-mile as a function of design factors and operating conditions is essential to planning\nand evaluating a transportation project. It is mildly interesting to know that the Middlesex Canal cut costs by 75%\nrelative to horse-drawn wagons, but a canal designer and his financial supporters will want to understand the potential\ncosts and benefits related to constructing a specific canal that would attract traffic from wagons. Given assumptions\nabout unit costs and productivity, it is possible to create an engineering-based cost model for a canal. Let's assume\nthat the operating costs and productivity parameters for a canal are based upon typical values for the early 19th century:\n\n-\nCost for the two-person boat crew ($1/day each, for ten working hours)\n-\nCost for the teamster and the horse ($1/day each or $2/day total)\n-\nCost for the boat ($2/day for a boat with a capacity of 15-tons)\n-\nCost for lock operations ($2/day for an operator and routine maintenance)\n-\nCost for canal and embankment maintenance ($40/year per mile)\n-\nAverage speed (three miles per hour along the tow path)\n-\nAverage time per lock (12 minutes for a 15-ton boat)\n-\nAnnual operations: 225 days per year\n-\nAnnual tonnage along the canal: 10,000 tons\n\nUsing these assumptions, we can estimate the variable costs of operation for a canal of any length and with any number\nof locks. For example, let's calculate the variable cost/ton-mile for a trip by a 15-ton canal boat along a 30-mile canal\nthat has 10 locks. First we need to know how long the trip will take:\n\n-\nTravel time along the canal: 30 miles/3 mph = 10 hours\n-\nTime in the locks: 10 locks x 0.2 hours per lock = 12 hours\n\nThe boat operates 10 hours per day, so the trip will take 1.2 days. Perhaps the crew finishes unloading in morning at\none end of the canal and hopes to reach the other end in time to start unloading the following afternoon. We will\nassume that the cost of the trip will include 1.2 days for the crew, the boat, the teamster and the horse:\n\n-\nBoat Crew: 2 people x $1/day x 1.2 days = $2.40\n-\nTeamster and horse: one team x $2/day x 1.2 days = $2.40\n-\nBoat cost: $2 per day x 1.2 days = $2.40\n-\nTotal variable cost = $7.20\n-\nTotal ton-miles = 15 tons x 30 miles = 450 ton-miles\n-\nVariable cost per ton-mile = $7.20/450 = $0.016/ton-mile\n-\nVariable cost per ton = $7.20/15 = $0.48/ton\n\nThe fixed costs include the cost for the lock operators (who are assumed to be available whether or not there is any\ntraffic) and the cost for canal maintenance.\n\n-\nLock operations: ($2/lock per day) x (10 locks) x (225 days per year) = $4,500 per year\n-\nMaintenance: $40/mile/year x 30 miles = $1,200 per year\n-\nTotal fixed cost: $5,700 per year\n-\nTotal fixed cost per ton: ($5,700/year)/(10,000 tons/year) = $0.57/ton\n-\nTotal fixed cost per 15-ton load: $8.55\n\nThe total, fully allocated cost for the trip will be the sum of the variable cost and the allocated portion of the fixed\ncost: $7.20 + $8.55 = $15.75. The total, fully allocated cost per ton-mile will be $15.75 per trip/450 ton-miles/trip =\n$0.035. This cost is well below the estimated cost of $0.21 per ton-mile of using a horse and wagon, so it is likely\nthat the canal could attract traffic and earn profits for the investors.\n\nIf these cost and capacity calculations used in this example were incorporated within a spreadsheet, it would be\npossible to explore how costs and capacity would vary with differing assumptions concerning the structure of the\ncanal, the size of the canal boats, the operating parameters, and the unit costs. Such a model could also be used to\nsee how costs/ton-mile would vary with the annual tonnage on the canal and the size of the boats.\n\nEvaluating the Canal Project\n\nFrom the designer's perspective, critical questions would concern the size of the canal: should they build it only to\naccommodate 15-ton boats, or should they build it to handle larger boats? To handle larger boats, the canal would\nhave to be a little wider and deeper, and the locks would have to be larger, so the costs of construction would rise. On\nthe other hand, with larger boats, the variable costs/ton-mile would be expected to decline, since the same crew could\nhandle a larger boat.\n\nFrom the owner's perspective (or the perspective of the banks and investors who were providing the funds for the\nproject), the key question would be whether or not they could charge tolls sufficiently large to cover their fixed costs\nof $5,700 per year plus sufficient profit to justify their investment. To figure out how much they would need to charge\nfor a toll, we need an estimate of what it would cost to build the canal. Canal costs were on the order of $20,000 per\nmile in the early 19th century, so that a 30-mile canal would have cost about $600,000 to construct. This money would\nhave to be raised from investors who would expect (or at least hope) to receive a substantial annual dividend. A 10%\ndividend would amount to $60,000 per year, so the total amount of money raised by the toll would have to be $65,700\nper year. If this were to be raised by a toll based upon tonnage, the average toll would have to be $6.57 for the expected\n10,000 tons/year.\n\nIs this a realistic toll? To answer this, we need to consider the perspective of the user. By using the canal rather than\na horse and wagon, the user transports freight at a variable cost of $0.48 per ton. The toll would raise this cost to more\nthan $7/ton or $0.25/ton-mile for the 28-mile canal- which is more than the cost of using a horse and wagon, which\nwas estimated above to be $0.21/ton-mile! With such a large toll, the canal would have difficulty attracting any traffic\nat all.\n\nUpon hearing this sad news, the investors would have several options. They could cancel the project as unprofitable.\nThey could settle for a smaller return on their investment; cutting the toll to $3.57 per ton would provide a 5% return,\nand it would keep the cost per ton-mile well below the cost of the competition. They might also conduct a more\ncareful study of demand, including an assessment regarding the potential for growth in canal traffic over a 10- to 20-\nyear horizon. They could also consider building the canal for larger boats, a strategy that would further reduce\noperating costs for users, possibly for a fairly modest increase in construction costs.\n\nNotice how the degree of precision has softened as we have progressed through this example. We started with some\nconcern over the many assumptions that we were making concerning capacity and operating costs. By the time we\ngot to the end, however, we discovered that the largest cost by far would be the return on investment that would be\nrequired to attract investors. Given the cost of the canal, the required toll would be an order of magnitude larger than\nthe users' operating costs, and the major problem with the project appears to be that there is not enough traffic to\njustify the investment.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, it doesn't matter much if at all whether the canal boats move along at 2 or at 3 mph, and it\ndoesn't matter whether the locks take 12 minutes or 15 minutes. It also doesn't matter whether the capacity of the\ncanal if 50% more or less than our preliminary estimate of 36,000 tons per year. Why? Because our projected demand\nis barely 25% of that amount; adequate capacity seems to be assured. The lack of precise estimates of operating costs\nand capacity doesn't matter nearly as much as what we have discovered to be much more important considerations:\n\n-\nHow much traffic will use the canal - when it first opens and over the next ten to twenty years? Perhaps the\ninvestors can defer dividends for a few years in order to secure very attractive profits in the future.\n-\nWhat will it really cost to build the canal and how great a return on their investment will investors require?\n-\nShould the canal be redesigned to handle larger boats that might attract more traffic?\n\nExamples of Canals\n\nChina constructed its Grand Canal more than 1300 years ago1. Linking Beijing with the country's major river systems\nand ultimately the coast, this canal provided a means of transporting a steady supply of grain from the south to the\nnorth of the country. During the 7th century, 300,000 tons of grain were transported per year along this route. The\ncanal was an enormous undertaking: 5.5 million laborers worked six years on one 1,500-mile stretch of the canal (20\nperson-years per mile).\n\nEngland's industrial revolution was given a strong push when canals were constructed that provided cheap\ntransportation for coal, agricultural products, and everything else2. The Bridgwater Canal, built in 1761 to link\nManchester with coal mines, halved the price of coal in Manchester and helped Manchester become England's leading\nindustrial center. By the 1840s, the country had a network of 5,000 miles of canals and navigable rivers, and nearly\nevery city or town was within 15 miles of a canal. As the country prospered, canals were built to be straighter, wider,\nand deeper; aqueducts were constructed to allow canals to cross rivers.\n\nThe Potowmack Canal was the first extensive system of river navigation in the US3. Championed by none other than\nGeorge Washington, the canal was designed to open up the area west of the Appalachian Mountains by providing a\nwater roue to the Potomac River (which flows toward what is now Washington D.C.). The canal allowed boats with\na 16-20 ton payload to make the 185-mile trip in three days at half the cost of transporting the same freight by horse\nand wagon. The canal ran into problems because of recessions, lack of skilled workers, and bad weather. The route\nwas navigable only for three months of the year, the canal tended to fill up with sediments, and the wooden locks\ndecayed. The canal did help spur investment in and development of the western region, but it was a financial failure.\nAfter an investment of $750,000 between 1785 and 1802, the canal company was $175,000 in debt by 1816.\n\nThe Middlesex Canal was a similar project that was aimed at providing a better link between Boston, Massachusetts\nand the farms and forests of New Hampshire4. The 27-mile canal required the construction of 50 bridges, 8 aqueducts,\nand 27 locks. The investment of $528,000 ($20,000 per mile) was, for the time, an enormous amount equal to 3% of\nthe assessed value of all property in Boston. The canal suffered because the freight - what little there was - was mostly\nsouthbound. Despite the small volume of freight, there were political disputes, as people in New Hampshire did not\nappreciate a company chartered by Massachusetts diverting freight from New Hampshire's major port.\n\nThe Erie Canal was the most ambitious canal project undertaken in the US during the 19th century5. The project was\nfirst proposed in 1724, and it was widely discussed for nearly 100 years as a means of linking New York City and the\nHudson River with the Great Lakes at a point to upstream of Niagara Falls. Because of the geography of the eastern\nUS, the Erie Canal route was the easiest way to get from Atlantic ports across the Appalachian Mountains. Thomas\nJefferson called the Erie Canal \"a splendid project - for the 20th century!\"\n\nGaining support for the construction of the canal required a major political effort, and not only because of the difficulty\nin financing such a large project. There was uncertainty about the route; an inland route would be expensive, but it\nwould avoid exposing trade to attacks from Canada if the route used Lake Ontario. Merchants who used ground\ntransport were against the project, because it would expose them to competition. There was also a lack of skilled\nengineers for carrying out the project - and the project therefore led to the creation of civil engineering schools at\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Union College.\n\nDeWitt Clinton was a member of the commission formed in 1810 to consider the construction of the canal. As a\nformer mayor of New York City, a US senator, and eventually as governor of New York, Clinton was the foremost\nchampion of the project, and it was finally approved by the state legislature. The 363-mile canal, with 83 locks and\n\n1 E.L.Newhouse, Ed., \"The Builders\", National Geographic Society, Washington DC, 1992, p. 29\n2 E.L.Newhouse, Ed., \"The Builders\", National Geographic Society, Washington DC, 1992, p. 30\n3 Schodek, \"Landmarks in American Civil Engineering\", MIT Press, Cambridge, MA pp. 3-6\n4 Schodek, op. cit., pp. 5-12\n5 Schodek, op. cit., pp. 13-19\n\n18 major aqueducts between Albany and Buffalo, was constructed between 1817 and 1825 at a cost of $8 million plus\nthe loss of 1000 lives from malaria and pneumonia.\n\nIn order to limit costs of construction, the canal was built just wide enough (40 feet) and deep enough (four feet) to\nhandle medium-sized boats. When the canal opened, demand and revenue exceeded all expectations, and it was\npossible to finance projects that increased the canal to a width of 70 feet and a depth of seven feet.\n\nThe long-term impact of the canal was immense. According to Schodek, opening up Lake Erie was the \"decisive\nimpetus\" for commerce in the eastern US to move east-west rather than north-south. Rochester and Buffalo became\nboom towns, and population in New York increased all along the route of the canal. The success of the Erie Canal\nsparked development of a system of canals in Ohio, as population and economic development in the country pushed\nfurther westward.\n\nEpilogue: Canals vs. Railroads\n\nTable 1 summarizes the costs and operating characteristics for the main transport options in the early 19th century.\nTurnpikes provided a way to achieve substantial improvements over rough roads, and they could easily be financed\nby tolls. Canals cost two to four times as much to construct, but they cut freight transport costs to a third of the costs\nof using turnpikes. Canals enjoyed only a brief period of supremacy in the United States, as they were restricted by\ntopography and their service was much slower that what was possible once railroads were introduced. Railroads were\nsimilar to canals in terms of construction cost and operating cost, but they were much faster and therefore much more\nattractive for passengers and for most kinds of freight.\n\nTable 1 Comparison of transportation Costs, first half of the 19th century\n\nLessons for Other Infrastructure Projects\n\nThis brief review of a few of the major canal projects in the US provides some useful lessons regarding projects:\n\n-\nIdeas and concepts for major infrastructure projects may abound long before the means to build the\ninfrastructure are available.\n-\nImportant public figures may become champions for particular projects.\n-\nMajor projects can, like the Erie Canal, be decisive in directing development and population growth, but it is\nalso possible to spend major resources on projects like the Potowmack and Middlesex Canals that have only\nmodest potential.\n-\nChanges in technology can kill projects (railroads quickly put these canals out of business by the mid-19th\ncentury).\nRough Road\n$1-2,000/mile to\nconstruct\n1 ton/wagon\n12 miles/day\n12 tm/day/vehicle\n$0.20 to $0.40/tm for\nfreight rates\nTurnpike\n$5-10,000/mile\n1.5 tons/wagon\n18 miles/day\n27 tm/d/v\n$0.15 to $0.20/tm\nCanal\n>$20,000/mile\n10-100 tons/boat\n20-30 miles/day\n200-3000 tm/d/v\n$0.05/tm\nRailroad\n$15-50,000/mile\n500 tons/train\n200 miles/day\n100,000 tm/d/v\n<$0.05/tm\n\n-\nFinancing is a major concern.\n\nThe discussion of canals also offers some insight to the different perspectives of the various participants in evaluating\nprojects. If potential users' costs are lower, they will use the facility. In deciding whether to use a new canal, potential\nusers had to ask whether it would be possible to lower freight costs by using canals rather than horse and wagon or by\nusing large canal boats rather than smaller boats. Potential users therefore would compare their costs for equipment\nand operations for their current and newly available options.\n\nOwners or entrepreneurs have a different question: should they build the facility? They have to compare annual\nrevenues to annual costs, taking into account the costs of construction and the continuing costs of operating and\nmaintenance. If they are going to borrow money, they have to be able to pay back the interest. If they are going to\ncharge tolls, they have to compare the amount of the toll to what users would actually save by using their facility. Set\nthe toll too high and nobody will use the facility.\n\nPotential investors have a simpler and more direct question: if they put their money into the project, would they be\nable to recover their investment plus a reasonable return? They should be worried about the feasibility of the project,\nthe time it could take to complete the project, and the ability of the project to actually generate revenue. They would\nnot necessarily have any interest in the details of the construction or the operation, and they would be comparing this\nproject with completely different options for making money.\n\nContractors may not care at all about what the project ultimately accomplishes, as long as they are able to complete\ntheir portion of the project on time, safely, and on budget. They will be very interested in trying to predict construction\ncosts, choosing the most effective technologies and materials, and in planning and managing the process. They must\ndetermine whether the potential profits from the project are worth the risks that they perceive to be associated with\nthe project.\n\nCase Study\nBuilding an Office Tower in Manhattan\n\nConsider a real estate developer who is looking for opportunities to create value by constructing buildings. If the\nestimated value of the newly created space is worth more than the expected development costs, then there is a\ndevelopment opportunity. For an office building, the value will be based upon the leases that can be obtained for the\noffice space. The development costs will include the cost of the land, preparation of the site, design & engineering,\nconstruction, and possibly various costs related to the approval process. For example, in return for building a new\nentrance to a subway station, the developer may be allowed to build more intensively.\n\nIn Manhattan and other urban centers, land becomes a very expensive resource, which causes strong economic\npressures for intensive development. In very general terms, the value of a building will be proportional to the usable\nspace that it contains, i.e. the space that can be leased to clients. Doubling the size of the building will therefore\nroughly double the usable space and therefore double the value of the building. On the other hand, development costs\nare not at all proportional to the size of the building. The price of the land depends upon the local real estate market,\nnot the value of what you intend to build; whether you build a single story warehouse or a 50-story office building,\nthe cost of the land will be the same. Moreover, whether that office building is twenty, fifty or eighty stories tall, it\nwill require access to local streets, a lobby and a roof. Adding stories will, for a large building, simply mean replicating\nthe designs and materials used for one story over and over again. While certain structural components will need to be\nstronger for a taller building, the added costs will be rather minor for a steel-framed structure.\n\nSince there are economies of scale in building, the incremental cost of adding another story will be well below the\naverage cost, while the incremental value of another floor of leasable space will not diminish (assuming the space can\nbe leased!). Hence, adding more stories and maximizing the usable space on each story will increase the value of the\nproject while reducing the average cost/square foot of the project. The developer therefore has a strong incentive to\nbuild the largest possible building.\n\nThere are various constraints to the size of the building that can or will be built:\n\n-\nZoning regulations may limit the portion of the site that can be developed or the total floor area ratio (FAR,\nthe ratio of floor space to the area of the site).\n-\nTechnological capabilities may limit the height (although the limit is obviously more than 100 stories and\nseldom if ever a real limit today).\n-\nMarket considerations may limit the amount of space that the developer wishes to make available today.\n\nKarl Sabbagh, in a highly readable book called \"Skyscraper\", described the re-development of an entire block in\nManhattan during the mid-1980s. The site, which had formerly been occupied by Madison Square Garden, was\nbetween 49th and 50th streets and 8th and 9th Avenues, a location in a rather rundown area somewhat west of the prime\noffice locations in Manhattan. Developing the site as an upscale office building was somewhat risky, not because the\nrents would be lower than in the best locations, but because it might not be possible to rent the space at any price. Bill\nZeckendorf, the developer, bought the land for $100 million, but only when he was reasonably sure that the site would\nbe able to attract tenants to what he called the \"Worldwide Plaza\".\n\n\"The whole magic of our industry is twofold. One is to build a beautiful building but, more important,\nit's got to be successful. The only way it becomes successful is if you start collecting rent. The sooner\nyou start collecting rent, the sooner the building becomes more successful. The minute you start collecting\nrent, all the sins of the father are forgiven. Everything that we've done wrong, they forget - we're all\nfriends again.\"\nMarvin Mass, HVAC Contractor, Worldwide Plaza, Skyscraper, p. 306\n\nThe zoning regulations called for a FAR of 12, which was increased by the city to 14 as a bonus for Zeckendorf's\nagreeing to make some improvements to the subway station on the site and to provide an acre of open space as part of\nthe project. This provided an opportunity for 1.9 million sq. ft. of usable space, of which 1.5 million was in a 50-story\noffice tower. Zeckendorf expected to be able to lease the space in the office tower at rates of $20-$30/sq.ft./year, with\npossible increases to $40 in the future. These estimated lease rates were discounted by about $5/sq.ft. from the rents\nachievable a few blocks toward the other side of Manhattan. At $20/sq.ft., the annual rent would be $32 million for\nthe office tower; at $30/sq.ft. the annual rent would be $48 million.\n\nThe estimated costs for the entire project were expected to exceed $500 million, and the costs for the office tower\nwere estimated to be $370 million (Table 1). The basic plan was to use a construction loan to cover the construction\ncosts and to refinance to a 30-year mortgage at a lower interest rate once the building opened. The construction loan\nwould have a high interest rate, because of the risks of delays and overruns in construction and the possibility that it\nmight not be possible to lease all of the space. If all went well, the building space would be leased at favorable rates\nto long-term tenants, and the lease payments would be more than enough to justify a mortgage sufficient to repay the\nconstruction loan.\n\nTable 1 Projected Costs of the 50-Story Office Tower\nCost Element\nEstimated Cost\nLand acquisition (office tower portion of the site)\n$58 million\nPreparation of case for development (architects and lawyers)\n$5 million\nArchitects, engineers and borrowing costs\n$145 million\nConstruction cost\n$145 million\nProject management\n$17 million\nTotal\n$370 million\n\nInterest rates and lease rates were the keys to the success of the project. Interest rates were likely to be on the order\nof 10% or more for the construction loan and on the order of 8% for the mortgage. The costs of the construction loan\nwere included in the estimated cost of the building, but delays and unexpected expenses could lead to higher interest\npayments. With an interest rate of 10% on the construction loan, the monthly interest on a balance of $370 million\nwould be about $3 million (10% per year/12 months/year)($370 million).\n\nIf the construction costs were indeed on the order of $370 million, and if Zeckendorf could obtain an 8% mortgage,\nthen the annual mortgage payments would be approximately $33 million:\n\nAnnual payment = $370 million [A/P,8%/,30]\n\n= $370 million (0.0888) = $32.9 million\n\nIf the building could indeed be rented at $30/sq.ft., then the $48 million annual revenue would seem to provide enough\ncash to cover this mortgage payment plus some operating expenses for managing the property. However, if the average\nlease rate were only $20/sq.ft., then the cash flow would be about the same as the mortgage payment, with no reserve\nfor managing the building. Thus, to have a successful project, it would be essential to complete the project on time\nand on budget, to secure long-term leases with favorable rates, and to secure long-term financing sufficient to cover\nthe costs of construction.\n\nThe building was actually constructed for about $380 million, as there were minor overruns in several areas related to\nconstruction or material problems. It was rented at rates of $26 to $32/sq.ft., with the lowest rate going to a major\ntenant who became a part-owner of the building and committed to leasing 600,000 square feet of space at the outset\nof the project. The next largest tenant obtained a rate of $29/sq.ft., which was lower than the owners wanted, but it\nwas accepted in the uncertain aftermath of the stock market crash of October 1987, just before the building was ready\nfor occupancy. Smaller tenants paid rates of about $32/sq.ft. By the end of the project, monthly interest costs were\nclose to $3 million and deferring rentals was costing close to $4 million per month.\n\nThe building was constructed on a \"Fast Track\" basis in order to minimize borrowing costs during the construction\nperiod and to begin lease payments as soon as possible (Table 2). The projected lease payments were sufficient to\njustify a permanent mortgage that enabled Zeckendorf to repay the construction loan. Despite the unexpected\ndownturn in the Manhattan real estate market, the building project was successful.\n\nTable 2 Project Timetable for the World Wide Plaza\nEvent\nDate\nSite Acqusition\nSecure major tenant as co-owner\nGround-breaking ceremony\nNovember 12, 1986\nInitial target for making space available to tenants\nNovember 25, 1988\nAll tenants in the building, working on finishing their space\nMarch 1989\nTenants start to move in\nMay 15, 1989\nPermanent mortgage obtained for the entire project\nMay 31, 1989\n\nThe overall viability of the building depended upon being able to complete construction close to budget without major\ndelays and being able to rent the building at something close to the expected rates. Both of these requirements were\nmet. However, the objectives of the different actors were not based upon the overall perspective:\n\n\"In this particular building you have a pretty characteristic group. You have the architect, who has the\ndesign as his main consideration. He wants to put up a monumental building, something everybody is\ngoing to see and say, 'Hey, wow! That's great!' It's his entry into posterity. The construction manager,\nHRH, they're interested in having a building up that they don't get sued over, that's going to stay in\nplace. Each of the individual trades have the same interest as the construction company. The only\ndifference is, each of the trades says, 'I'm only going to do so much. The rest is someone else's\nresponsibility.' So then you have to argue out who's actually doing what part of the interface between\nthe various trades. The consultant is working to represent the interest of the owner. Again, he's after\na viable building, something the guy can make money with. He's not investing money to lose it. He also\nwants to make sure it's sound. I tell you, he has about the same interest as the construction manager.\"1\n\nOther participants would include the banks that provide the construction loan and the permanent mortgage. For them,\nthe project involves providing a large sum of money up front in the hopes of receiving a larger sum a few years in the\nfuture (when the construction loan is repaid) or receiving an annuity that will provide a guaranteed return over a much\nlonger period (via mortgage payments over a 30-year period). The banks take care to ensure that the size of the\nmortgage is limited by the ability of the owners to make mortgage payments; the banks will offer lower interest rates\nif they are more certain that the project will be successful.\n\n1 Sabbagh, op. cit. p. 199\n\nCase Study\nMultiple Internal Rates of Return for a Stadium Project\n\nThis case involves a hypothetical example in which there are multiple internal rates of return. The case\nis structured as the kind of situation that could face a young engineering economist trying to rank\nalternative projects for senior management. If the analysis is done using net present value, then the\npotential benefits of the project are clear. But when senior management insists upon using the internal\nrate of return, all kinds of problems emerge.\n\nYou have accepted an internship position that gives you a chance to do what you always wanted to do - work in the\nfront office of a major league team. With your background in project evaluation, you have been asked to calculate\nthe financial potential of the proposed new stadium. At a meeting with the president, the general manager, the VP\nfinance, and several consultants, you learn the general plan. The stadium will be constructed over two years, with a\ntotal cost of $250 million. Constructing the stadium will lead to two very large immediate payoffs from selling 20-\nyear leases on corporate boxes and selling real estate around the stadium to various hotel and restaurant chains.\nRevenue will be about $8 million per year in the first 10 years, after which a major rehabilitation and expansion is\nplanned at cost of $50 million. With a somewhat larger stadium, revenues are expected to rise. Management plans to\nuse all of that revenue plus some additional funds for further development of the area; thus cash flows are expected to\nbe negative for several years before there is another big payout in year 20 when they are able to complete and sell\nmore of the real estate. Table 1 summarizes the expected cash flows.\n\nTable 1 Expected Cash Flows for Stadium Project\n\nYear\nInvestment\nRevenue\nCost\nCash Flow\n\n-100\n\n-140\n\n-50\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-40\n\n-60\n\nYou create a spreadsheet with all of this information and then set out to determine the internal rate of return. First you\ntry 8%, but that gives a positive NPV of $2.8 million; then you try 12%, but that gives a negative NPV of $4.8 million.\nYou figure the NPV will be zero somewhere in the middle of these two, and you eventually determine that the NPV\nis zero with a discount rate of 9.85%. You therefore prepare a presentation that concludes that the stadium project has\n\nan internal rate of return of \"just under 10%\". You're quite proud of your work and rush into show your boss your\nresult (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 IRR for Stadium Project is Nearly 10%\n\nYear\nCash Flow\n8%\n12%\n9.85%\n-$100.0\n-$100.0\n-$100.0\n-$100.0\n-$140.0\n-$129.6\n-$125.0\n-$127.4\n$148.0\n$126.9\n$118.0\n$122.6\n$148.0\n$117.5\n$105.3\n$111.7\n$8.0\n$5.9\n$5.1\n$5.5\n$8.0\n$5.4\n$4.5\n$5.0\n$8.0\n$5.0\n$4.1\n$4.6\n$8.0\n$4.7\n$3.6\n$4.1\n$7.0\n$3.8\n$2.8\n$3.3\n$7.0\n$3.5\n$2.5\n$3.0\n-$50.0\n-$23.2\n-$16.1\n-$19.5\n$10.0\n$4.3\n$2.9\n$3.6\n$5.0\n$2.0\n$1.3\n$1.6\n$0.0\n$0.0\n$0.0\n$0.0\n-$5.0\n-$1.7\n-$1.0\n-$1.3\n-$10.0\n-$3.2\n-$1.8\n-$2.4\n-$20.0\n-$5.8\n-$3.3\n-$4.4\n-$30.0\n-$8.1\n-$4.4\n-$6.1\n-$40.0\n-$10.0\n-$5.2\n-$7.4\n-$60.0\n-$13.9\n-$7.0\n-$10.1\n$90.0\n$19.3\n$9.3\n$13.7\nTotal\n\n$2.8\n-$4.3\n$0.0\n\nYour boss is rather more subdued that you were, as he understands that 10% is no great rate of return for the crafty\nmen and women who run the major league team. He also notes that the cash flows are weird, with several shifts\nbetween positive to negative (Figure 1). He fears that there might be a problem with the IRR that you calculated. He\ntherefore runs the cash flows through his program and quickly obtains what is shown as Table 3. A quick look at the\nbottom row of this table indicates that the NPV is zero when the discount rate is 2%, suggesting that the IRR is a\ndismal 2%. On the other hand, the table also supports your calculation, as the NPV is also zero for something a little\nless than 10%.\n\nNow you and your boss can't go to the CEO and the stadium committee and say that the project is perhaps OK, with\nan IRR of nearly 10%, except that it may be dismal, with an IRR of only 2%.

By\nusing the external rate of return method, it is possible to get a better estimate of the return on investment for the\nstadium project. The costs are all discounted to the present using a rate of 8%, which is the MARR for the stadium\nowners. The future value of annual revenues is calculated as of year 20 (using the same rate of 8%). The NPV of the\ncosts is $399 million, while the future value FV of the benefits is $1,873 million, as shown in Table 4. The return on\ninvestment calculated with the ERR method is the annual rate of return at which $399 million would grow to $1,873\nmillion in 20 years. The answer can be gained by solving the following equation for i%.\n\nFV = NPV (1+ i%)20\n\nTrial and error on a spreadsheet shows the answer to be 8.04%, so the report to the CEO and the committee could\nindicate that the project has an expected return on investment of 8%.\n\nTable 4 Calculating the External Rate of Return for the Stadium Project\n\nYear\nInvestment\nRevenue\nCost\nCash\nFlow\n\nCost\nNPV of\nCosts\nFV of\nBenefits\n$100\n$0\n\n-$100.0\n\n-$100.0\n-$100.0\n$0.0\n\n-140.0\n\n-150.0\n-138.9\n43.2\n\n148.0\n\n-2.0\n-1.7\n599.4\n\n148.0\n\n-2.0\n-1.6\n555.0\n\n8.0\n\n-2.0\n-1.5\n34.3\n\n8.0\n\n-2.0\n-1.4\n31.7\n\n8.0\n\n-2.0\n-1.3\n29.4\n\n8.0\n\n-2.0\n-1.2\n27.2\n\n7.0\n\n-3.0\n-1.6\n25.2\n\n7.0\n\n-3.0\n-1.5\n23.3\n\n-50.0\n\n-50.0\n-23.2\n0.0\n\n10.0\n\n-20.0\n-8.6\n60.0\n\n5.0\n\n-25.0\n-9.9\n55.5\n\n0.0\n\n-30.0\n-11.0\n51.4\n\n-5.0\n\n-35.0\n-11.9\n47.6\n\n-10.0\n\n-40.0\n-12.6\n44.1\n\n-20.0\n\n-50.0\n-14.6\n40.8\n\n-30.0\n\n-60.0\n-16.2\n37.8\n\n-40.0\n\n-70.0\n-17.5\n35.0\n\n-60.0\n\n-90.0\n-20.9\n32.4\n\n90.0\n\n-10.0\n-2.1\n100.0\nTotal\n\n-$8.0\n\n-$399.1\n$1,873.2\n\nThe external rate of return approach is favored by academics, as it avoids the necessity of implying unreasonable\nreturns for reinvesting profits, and it provides a reasonable means of dealing with future periods with negative cash\nflow. However, this approach is unlikely to be encountered outside of textbooks. Public agencies are apt to consider\nratios of benefits to cost rather than ROI, while private companies use the internal rate of return as an easier and\napparently more objective result.\n\nCase Study\nPublic Incentives for Low-Income Housing\n\nPublic and private interests may come together to promote multiple objectives by allowing denser\ndevelopment in a suburban setting. Re-zoning land for denser development can offer great\nopportunities for developers. Requiring the new developments to serve social purposes, such as\nhousing for families with low-income, may be the grounds for a public-private partnership (PPP).\n\nSuppose that a developer is interested in constructing apartment houses in a suburban town where zoning currently\nallows only single-family housing on 1-acre lots. The developer has plans for constructing three buildings with 10\napartments each on a 5-acre site. The expected cost per unit is $150,000 and the developer plans to lease the units for\n$2,500/month. Operating expenses are expected to be $500/month per unit. The annual net income is therefore:\n\nAnnual net income = 10 units ( $2,000 /month/unit) (12 months/year)\n\n= $240,000 per year\n\nSince the ten-unit building is expected to cost $1.5 million to construct, the expected ROI is expected to be\n$240,000/$1.5 million, or 16%. The developer's MARR is 12%, so this is a very attractive proposition. However,\nunless the zoning is changed, the 5-acre site will only be able to be used for five single-family houses. Without the\nzoning change, the developer would have to sell the recently acquired site and seek development rights elsewhere.\n\nThe town is interested in creating housing that will be suitable for low- and middle-income families. They thought\nthat it might be possible for the town to build low-income housing, which would be made available to town employees\nat a maximum rent of $1000 per month. They found that the construction costs for a 5-unit building would be $160,000\nper unit, with monthly operating costs of $600 per unit. The net rent per month would therefore be just $400. The\ntown could sell bonds with an interest rate of 4%, so that the annual interest cost per unit would be 4% ($160,000) =\n$6,400. The net rent of $400 per month or $4,800 per year would be insufficient to cover these interest payments. If\nthe town went this route, they would have to include an additional $6,400 - $4,800 = $1,600 per unit in the town's\nbudget, which they would prefer not to do. The town therefore approached the developer about the possibility of\nallocating some of the units in the proposed apartments to low-income residents whose rent would be set at $1,000\nper month.\n\nThe first question is whether or not there is some basis for a partnership. To answer this, we need to determine the\nmaximum reduction in rent that the developer could accept while still earning an acceptable return on the project.\nWith an MARR of 12%, the developer needs an annual return of $180,000 (12% of the $1.5 million investment),\nwhich is $60,000 less than the expected rent of $240,000 per year. Reducing the rent from the market rate of $2,500\nper month to the desired rate of $1,000 per month would cause a loss of revenue of $1,500/month or $18,000/year for\neach unit. Thus, even if the developer had to make three units available to town employees at the lower rent, he would\nstill have an acceptable MARR:\n\nROI with 3 low-income units = ($240,000 - 3 x $18,000)/$1.5 million = 12.4%\n\nIf the developed is forced to decide between abandoning the project and accepting a project in which three units are\nreserved for low-income families paying lower rents, then the developer would likely accept the deal. Of course, the\ndeveloper would be likely to say \"if you provide a subsidy of $1,500 per month per unit ($18,000 per year), you could\nrent as many as you like.\"\n\nThe town would probably consider $1,600 per year as the maximum subsidy that they would consider, as they could\nbuild their own complex if they were willing to provide that level of subsidy. Thus they would be unwilling to provide\nanything close to the desired subsidy.\n\nOn the other hand, they could perhaps offer something else. Suppose the state had approved legislation aimed at\npromoting the development of low-income housing by allowing the state to guarantee the interest on loans associated\nwith constructing housing in which at least 25% of the units were reserved for qualifying low-income families. Under\nthis legislation, the interest rate on the developer's loans would drop by 2% if the development qualified. If the\ndeveloper had a loan of $1.5 million, a 2% reduction in the interest rate would be worth more than $30,000 per year.\nThis would be equivalent to $10,000 per unit if three units were reserved for low-income families.\n\nIs this enough to close the deal? Maybe and maybe not. It depends upon how badly the developer wants to proceed\nand how aggressive the town is willing to be in considering the re-zoning application. It is conceivable that some\nresidents in the town will prefer not to attract low-income families - and it is conceivable that others will be very\nsupportive of initiatives that allow young families and public employees to live in the town. Another step that could\nbe taken would be to allow the developer to add a couple of more units to each building, thereby making the overall\ndevelopment more attractive.\n\nCase Study\nFinancing a Bridge Project\n\nWhat is the best way to finance a bridge? Will the state or federal government provide funds, or\nwill the city have to finance the project? Could tolls be sufficient to cover financing costs? If so,\nwill tolls be acceptable to the public? Should the city allow a private contractor to build the\nbridge and collect the tolls?\n\nOverview of Options for Financing a Bridge Project\n\nA bridge could be built as a public project, a private project, or a public/private partnership (PPP). If the bridge were\nbuilt as a public project, then there would be several options for financing. The bridge could be viewed as part of the\nhighway system, and whatever funds are used to construct highways could be used to pay for the construction of the\nbridge. For example, the federal or state government may have a highway trust fund (HTF)1 that uses income from\nfuel taxes and registration fees to pay for authorized additions to the highway network (Figure 1). If the bridge is\napproved as a project that can be supported by the HTF, the design and construction of the bridge can be begun. This\nis the basic approach that was used in the United States to create the Interstate Highway System and many state\nhighways. State and city governments may also use tax revenues to support highway projects, and they can sell bonds\nto raise some of the funds required for construction.\n\nFigure 1 Structure of a Highway Trust Fund: money collected from various fees and taxes is used to fund\nauthorized projects, sometimes including transit or intermodal projects as well as highway projects.\n\nA city or state will commonly finance a bridge project using funds from the HTF or by selling bonds to cover the\nconstruction costs and using money from the state's Department of Transportation (DOT) budget to cover annual\noperating costs. If bonds are sold to help finance the bridge, and if there are no tolls on the bridge, then the bonds are\nbacked by credit of the state or local government. If there are tolls, then the bonds would be backed by the expected\n\n1 The federal HTF was created in 1956 as a mechanism for financing the constructing the Interstate Highway System. Fees and\ntaxes on fuel and heavy trucks provided sufficient revenue to cover the federal government's 90% share of the construction costs.\nSubsequent legislation allowed small amounts of the fund to be diverted to transit and intermodal projects. The federal fund can\nonly be used for construction, not for operations or maintenance, which remain state responsibilities. States have similar funds,\nwith fuel taxes again providing the major source of revenue. For the complete history of the HTF and the Interstate Highway\nSystem, see Tom Lewis, Divided Highways, Penguin Books, NY, 1997.\nHighway\nTrust Fund\n(HTF)\nFuel Taxes\nTaxes on Tires\nVehicle\nRegistration Fees\nFunding for Authorized Projects:\n-\nHighway Projects\n-\nIntermodal Projects\n-\nTransit Projects\n\ntoll payments. Once the bridge is constructed, it clearly belongs to a particular government agency and that agency\nor another agency is responsible for maintaining and if necessary rehabilitating the bridge. If bonds were sold to pay\nfor the bridge, then those bonds may affect the credit rating of the city or state. If the project were funded out of tax\nrevenues, then it may have been necessary to defer work on schools, water resource projects, or other government\nprojects or activities. Also, some cities or states have limits on the total debt that they can incur. Borrowing to pay\nfor the bridge therefore may limit their ability to borrow for some other purpose. Hence, there may be strong incentives\nto use tolls to finance the bridge.\n\nFigure 2 Cash flows from the sale of bonds and money from the state's HTF\ncover the initial costs of the project, plus continuing maintenance costs and\ninterest payments on the bonds.\n\nSome additional analysis is needed to determine whether toll financing, a state highway project or a PPP is the best\noption for this bridge. The first question is whether or not the bridge is on a route that would qualify for funding as\npart of the state highway system. If not, the next question is whether or not high enough tolls can be charged to cover\nthe costs of interest and operations. If so, then the question is whether the city should build the bridge and collect the\ntolls or whether the city should create a public/private partnership to build and operate the bridge. The city could\nauthorize the bridge and provide the connections to local roads, while a private company could raise funds to pay for\nthe construction costs. The private company would then charge tolls so as to earn a return on its investment. This\napproach works only if the expected value of the tolls is sufficient to provide an adequate return on capital, e.g. more\nthan enough to cover the interest due on bonds and annual operating expense. The limit on the toll would be the value\nthat users would place upon using the bridge. The toll could be quite high for a bridge that would provide a much\nshorter or less congested route, but if other bridges are located nearby, then the presence or absence of tolls on those\nbridges would affect what can be charged on the new bridge. With this approach to building the bridge, the costs\nwould be borne by the private company, not by any public agency, so the construction of the bridge would not affect\nany public budgets or capital plans. On the other hand, if the bridge is built privately, then the design and capacity of\nthe bridge, as well as the level of tolls charged would be determined by the private company, possibly with an eye\ntoward maximizing profits rather than maximizing public benefits. There could be intense public opposition to\nallowing a private company to charge what might be viewed as exorbitant tolls in order make excessive profits on an\nugly bridge with limited capacity. Thus, there would likely be political pressure to retain some aspect of public control\nover the project.\n\nFigure 3 Toll Booth on the West Virginia Turnpike: Most\nof the turnpikes in the U.S. were constructed by state\ngovernments prior to the start of the Interstate Highway\nProgram. Tolls cover the interest and redemption costs related\nto the bonds sold to finance the roads and also cover the costs\nof maintenance and operations. Tolls can also be used to\nmanage congestion, by charging higher rates at peak hours or\nby charging higher rates for an express lane. Some states have\nconsidered privatizing their toll roads as a means of capturing\nthe value of their investments, either to finance future transport\nsystem improvements or to reduce their states' indebtedness.\n\nVarious options could be used in a PPP. One common approach is for the public agency to seek bids in which the key\nvariables would include a) the design of the bridge, b) the tolls to be charged and c) the length of time over which the\nprivate company would operate the bridge. The bridge would be owned (or eventually be owned) by the public\nagency, but it would be operated for an extensive period before it was turned over to the public agency. The public\nrole could be to retain control over the size, design, and location, and purpose of the bridge; to ensure that the tolls are\nreasonable; to provide some financial security for the private company by providing some sort of minimum annual\npayment if traffic volumes do not rise as expected; or to provide assurance that a competitive project would not be\nbuilt within some specified period of time.\n\nLet's examine the various financing options using a hypothetical bridge project. Suppose that a new bridge has been\nproposed that would reduce the travel time and cost between two rapidly growing regions in the rural portion of a\nstate. The bridge, which is strongly supported by local officials, would create a route that would save each user an\naverage of ten miles and 15 minutes. The bridge is expected to cost between $40 and $60 million to construct, and\nannual maintenance and operating costs are expected to be $4 to $5 million. There are currently 10,000 vehicles per\nday that use the route, and a preliminary study indicates that nearly all of this traffic would use the new bridge. About\n80% of the vehicles on this route are automobiles, while nearly all of the rest are trucks. We will consider three\noptions, namely structuring the project as a routine state highway project, as a private toll bridge, or as a public/private\ninitiative.\n\nCan the Bridge be Justified as a State Project?\n\nLocal officials would like naturally prefer the option in which the state pays for the bridge and does not charge a toll,\nas this would result in the maximum benefits for local citizens and companies. They would also like the bridge to be\nconstructed as soon as possible, preferably within the next two to five years. The big question is whether or not this\nbridge project can be justified as part of the state's transportation investment plan.\n\nTo answer this question, it is necessary to consider the state's transportation budget and the nature of other projects\ncompeting for state funds. The state has a prioritized list of transportation projects based upon a formula that\nrecognizes the benefits of reducing congestion, improving safety, reducing travel times, and promoting economic\ndevelopment. For this example, assume that it is apparent that the proposed bridge would not have a very high priority.\nThere are many projects involving bridges and road rehabilitation involving much more heavily traveled routes in\nmore densely populated areas of the state, while the existing route, though long, has very few accidents and essentially\nno congestion. In short, this is a low priority bridge, and there is no immediate way to dramatize the need for it.\nMoreover, the state's highway trust fund is substantially underfunded, primarily because fuel taxes have not been\nincreased for nearly 20 years. The trust fund can barely provide enough funds for high priority projects, and medium\n\npriority projects have been set back ten or more years in the state's investment plan. In short, local officials cannot\nexpect to have the state pay for the proposed new bridge.\n\nCould a Private Bridge Project be Financed with Tolls?\n\nWould it be possible for a private company to build the bridge? If so, would that be a good idea for the region? The\neconomic value of the bridge is the time and cost saved by those who use the bridge to shorten their travel distances\nplus additional benefits related to economic development that is likely to result from the increase in mobility provided\nby the new bridge.\n\nIn this example, assume that the major economic benefit comes from a reduction in travel expense for those that use\nthe new bridge. The state DOT estimates the marginal cost per mile for driving an automobile to be $0.20, taking into\nconsideration the cost of fuel and the wear and tear on the vehicle. The marginal cost per mile for driving a truck is\non the order of $0.50. The average value of the time saved is on the order of $10 for automobile passengers and $20\nfor trucks.\n\nWould a private company be able to finance the bridge by selling bonds backed by toll revenues? The first step is to\nestimate the annual revenue that must be raised by the tolls. If the bridge is financed by selling corporate bonds, the\ninterest rate would have to be about 8%. The interest costs would therefore be 8% of the construction cost, or $3 to\n$5 million.2 The total annual cost, including maintenance and operations as well as interest, would therefore be $8 to\n$10 million.\n\nThe next step is to estimate the potential annual revenue. The toll can be no higher than the economic benefit of using\nthe bridge. Using the DOT cost numbers, the average benefits per user can be estimated:\n\nAuto benefits = 10 miles ($0.20/mile) + 0.25 hours ($10/hour) = $4.50\n\nTruck benefits = 10 miles ($0.50/mile) + 0.25 hours ($20/hour) = $10\n\nWeighted average benefits per vehicle = 0.8 ($4.50) + 0.2 ($10) = $5.60\n\nIf 10,000 vehicles used the bridge per day, the annual economic benefits would be as follows:\n\nAnnual benefits = $5.60/veh. (10,000 veh./day) (365 days/yr) = $20 million per year.\n\nIn other words, the annual economic benefits appear to be at least double the annual costs for interest and operations,\neven if the bridge costs are at the high end of what is anticipated. A toll of $3 for automobiles and $6 for trucks would\nbe sufficient to cover annual costs. Moreover, since the regions served by the bridge are rapidly growing, traffic\nvolumes and toll revenues would be expected to rise. Thus, it does appear to be feasible for a private company to\nbuild the bridge using money raised by selling bonds and paying the interest on the bonds with tolls that users would\nbe willing to pay.\n\nShould the Bridge Be Built as a Public Private Partnership?\n\nThe public might well object to the prospect of a private company building the cheapest possible bridge and charging\nthe highest possible tolls. The analysis has shown that a toll of $3 per car and $6 per truck would be more than\nsufficient to cover the 8% interest rate that the private company would pay on its bonds. However, the same analysis\nshowed that the toll could be nearly 50% higher and still attract most of the traffic. If the bridge is as critical as the\nlocal officials believe, and if the region continues to grow as expected, then traffic volume - and toll revenues - would\nbe expected to increase substantially over the life of the bridge. Might it be better to structure the project as a\npublic/private partnership?\n\n2 If the construction cost is at the low end of the estimates, then the annual interest will be 8% of $40 million; at the high end of\nthe estimates, the interest would b 8% of 60 million. These are all estimates, so all that can be said is that the interest payments are\nlikely to be $3 to $5 million per year.\n\nThe logic for public involvement is that interest costs could be lowered and that tolls could be controlled. A regional\nauthority could be created that would approve the design for the bridge and own the bridge, and this authority could\nseek a partner or partners to construct and operate the bridge. With public backing, it would be possible to get lower\ninterest rates by selling tax-free municipal bonds to fund the project. Even if the regional authority were unwilling or\nunable to sell bonds to finance the project, they could still seek bids for constructing and operating the bridge. They\ncould also stipulate that the bridge (and the toll revenues) would revert to the regional authority after a period of twenty\nor more years.\n\nCase Study\nUsing a Probabilistic Model to Investigate Financial Risks\n\nThis example shows how to create a simple spreadsheet that can be used to explore risk and\nuncertainty using random variables for the key factors in the analysis.\n\nWhen evaluating a potential project, owners and investors will naturally be concerned about making enough profit to\nachieve their minimum acceptable rate of return. If they are borrowing money for the project, then they want the\nprofit from operations to be large enough to cover interest payments on the debt that they have incurred while also\nproviding an acceptable rate of return on their equity, i.e. what they themselves have invested.\n\n(Eq. 1)\nInvestment = Equity + Debt\n\n(Eq. 2)\nProfit = Revenue - Cost - (Interest rate)(Debt)\n\n(Eq. 3)\nROI = Profit/Equity\n\nIn any project, there will, at the outset, be considerable uncertainty related to each of the variables in these equations.\nThe total investment will not be known until construction is completed, and the amount of debt and the interest rate\non the debt will not be known until financing is arranged. Actual revenues and operating costs will be uncertain for\nsome time after project completion, as it may take some years for the entire project to reach full operation.\n\nIt is possible to treat all of the variables in Equations 1 to 3 as random variables. Each time that a random variable is\nencountered in an analysis, a value for that variable is generated from a set of possible discrete values or a possible\ndistribution of values. If there are more than one random variables in a set of equations, then they could be independent\nor dependent. If they are independent, then the value selected for one variable does not affect the value selected for\nthe other variable. If they are independent, then the value selected for one variable will influence the value selected\nfor the other variable.\n\nRandom variables can be created in spreadsheets by using the function that generates random numbers. In Excel, for\nexample, it is possible to use the function RAND() to generate a random number greater than or equal to 0 and less\nthan 1.0. Whenever the spreadsheet is recalculated, a different random number will be returned. This function can\nbe used to create random variables that take on a value that is believed to be uniformly distributed between a minimum\nvalue A and a maximum value B:\n\n(Eq. 4)\nRandom Value between A and B = A + RAND() (B-A)\n\nA random variable can also be defined to take on discrete values. For example, suppose that a random variable could\ntake one of two equally likely values V1 or V2. This random variable can be created in a spread sheet as follows. First\nselect a random number by using RAND(), then create a scheme such as this:\n\n(Eq. 5)\nDiscrete Random Variable = V1 if 0 ≤ RAND() < 0.5\n\n(Eq. 6)\nDiscrete Random Variable = V2 if 0.5 ≤ RAND() < 1\n\nIf the values are not equally likely, then it is possible to adjust the ranges in these equations. For instance, if V1 is\nthree times as likely as V2, then:\n\n(Eq. 7)\nDiscrete Random Variable = V1 if 0 ≤ RAND() < 0.75\n\n(Eq. 8)\nDiscrete Random Variable = V2 if 0.75 ≤ RAND() < 1\n\nThis process can readily be extended to allow any number of discrete values, each with their own probability, by\ndividing the interval between 0 and 1 into increments such that the length of each increment equals the desired\nprobability for each value. Thus, we can now create a random variable R that takes of values V1, V2, ... Vn with\nprobabilities P1, P2, ... Pn .\n\nIt is possible to create new random variables as the sum, ratio, or other functions of multiple random independent\nvariables. Thus, if investment, revenue and cost are independent random variables, then profit and ROI will also be\nrandom variables. It is also easy to create a random variable that is dependent upon the value of another random\nvariable. This can be done by using statements such as this in a spreadsheet:\n\n(Eq. 9)\nR2 = a + b R1\n\nIn this case, the value of R2 will depend upon the value of R1. More complex equations can also be used to allow\ndifferent calculations for R2 depending upon the value of R1. For example:\n\n(Eq. 10)\nIf R1 < A then R2 = 100 + R1\nbut if R ≥A, then R2 = 50 + R1\n\nWith some ingenuity, it is possible to design quite complex simulations using a spreadsheet. A time-based simulation\ncan be structured by having values of variable in one time period depend upon the situation at the end of the previous\ntime period. If all the variables, random numbers, and calculations are included in one (possibly very long) row of\nthe spreadsheet, then copying that row over a range of rows will produce a simulation of how the system will change\nover time. The following hypothetical example demonstrates how random variables can be used to estimate the\nprobability that a proposed project will be acceptable.\n\nSuppose a company is considering making an investment of $100 million to purchase the rights to operate an existing\ntoll road. Toll revenues are expected to range from $20 to $25 million annually, while operating and maintenance\nexpenses are expected to range from $10 to $15 million annually. The company plans to sell bonds to raise $80 million\nat 8% interest and raise $20 million from equity investors who anticipate a 10% ROI. Assuming that revenue and\noperating costs are independent random variables, what is the likelihood that the ROI will exceed 10% in any given\nyear? What is the likelihood that net revenues in any year will be insufficient to cover the interest costs? A quick\nglance at the minimum expected revenue and the maximum expected cost shows that the annual revenue could be as\nlow $5 million, which would be insufficient to cover the $6.4 million interest on the bonds. Is this something that\ninvestors should worry about?\n\nTo answer this question, revenue and cost can be defined as independent random variables. Investment cost, total\ndebt, and interest rate on debt are assumed to be $100 million, $80 million and 8%. Profit will be as follows:\n\n(Eq. 11)\nProfit = Revenue - Cost - 8% ($80 million)\n\nTable 1 shows results from a probabilistic model that was created in a spreadsheet. The table has 20 rows, each of\nwhich could be viewed as a separate year over a 20 year period or 20 different random results for a single year.\nInvestment, debt and interest rates are assumed to be as given, but the spreadsheet has an area at the upper right where\nthese factors can be modified. Each row of the main body of the spreadsheet has two random variables. The first is\nused to calculate a value for revenue and the second is used to calculate a variable for cost, both using Equation 4.\nProfit is calculated using Equation 11 and ROI is calculated as profit/equity (Equation 3). The average ROI is\ncalculated as the average profit divided by the net investment of $20 million. According to this analysis, the financial\naspects of the project are solid. There is very little chance that net revenues will be unable to cover costs, and the\nexpected ROI is over 20%, well above what the investors have been promised. The annual values vary considerably,\nreflecting the uncertainty in the estimates of revenue and cost. However, the risk of failure is very low.\n\nOnce this spreadsheet was created, it was possible to conduct further analyses within a few minutes. For example:\n\n-\nRunning the analysis 10 times produced average ROI ranging from 16.8% to 23.2%; the median ROI was\n18.1%.\n-\nIf interest rates were increased to 9%, the average ROI ranged from 8.7% to 18.4%; the median ROI in 11\ntrials was 14%. Increasing interest rates on the bonds naturally reduces ROI, but the project still can be\nexpected to have better than a 10% return, which is what the investors are looking for.\n-\nIf there is a cost overrun, and the investors have to put up an additional $20 million, the ROI ranged from 6%\nto 11.4% with a median of 8.6%. Thus, controlling construction costs appears to be quite important.\n\nTable 1 A Spreadsheet That Uses Random Numbers to Explore Risks\nand Uncertainties Associated with a Project\n\nInvestment\n$100 million\n\nDebt\n$80 million\n\nInterest\n8%\n\nYear\nRandom\nNumber 1\nRandom\nNumber 2\nRevenue\nCost\nInterest\nProfit\nROI\n0.887713\n0.138114\n24.44\n10.69\n6.40\n7.35\n36.7%\n0.997132\n0.077517\n24.99\n10.39\n6.40\n8.20\n41.0%\n0.651748\n0.191994\n23.26\n10.96\n6.40\n5.90\n29.5%\n0.474722\n0.464287\n22.37\n12.32\n6.40\n3.65\n18.3%\n0.922596\n0.886441\n24.61\n14.43\n6.40\n3.78\n18.9%\n0.415191\n0.818556\n22.08\n14.09\n6.40\n1.58\n7.9%\n0.739819\n0.764117\n23.70\n13.82\n6.40\n3.48\n17.4%\n0.425825\n0.106793\n22.13\n10.53\n6.40\n5.20\n26.0%\n0.771215\n0.067184\n23.86\n10.34\n6.40\n7.12\n35.6%\n0.590406\n0.437435\n22.95\n12.19\n6.40\n4.36\n21.8%\n0.607368\n0.91192\n23.04\n14.56\n6.40\n2.08\n10.4%\n0.005216\n0.406998\n20.03\n12.03\n6.40\n1.59\n8.0%\n0.382789\n0.919088\n21.91\n14.60\n6.40\n0.92\n4.6%\n0.003209\n0.711268\n20.02\n13.56\n6.40\n0.06\n0.3%\n0.479641\n0.470464\n22.40\n12.35\n6.40\n3.65\n18.2%\n0.172015\n0.24961\n20.86\n11.25\n6.40\n3.21\n16.1%\n0.648983\n0.107807\n23.24\n10.54\n6.40\n6.31\n31.5%\n0.065481\n0.587854\n20.33\n12.94\n6.40\n0.99\n4.9%\n0.930513\n0.395585\n24.65\n11.98\n6.40\n6.27\n31.4%\n0.94164\n0.431054\n24.71\n12.16\n6.40\n6.15\n30.8%\nTotal\n\n455.57\n245.72\n128.00\n81.85\n20.5%\n\nCase Study\nApplying Performance-Based Technology Scanning\nto Intercity Passenger Transportation\n\nThis case study applies performance-based technology scanning to intercity passenger services, drawing upon\nresearch conducted for the UIC (Union Internationale de Chemins de Fer).1 As the research was conducted for\na railway organization, the focus was on how to enhance the competitiveness of rail transportation, and that is\nthe perspective that is taken throughout this section. The research ultimately related to the types of projects that\nwould be desirable for attracting more intercity travelers to the railways of the world. Increasing the maximum\ntrain speed is often seen as the best way to improve the competitiveness of passenger rail service, but considering\ntechnological options using the PBTS framework suggested many other opportunities for improving rail\ncompetitiveness. Construction of high-speed rail corridors will be helpful in some locations, but other types of\nprojects may prove to be just as useful and more cost-effective.\n\nCompetition for Intercity Passenger Services\n\nThe role of rail in intercity transportation varies widely around the world. In China, India, and Russia, where incomes\nare low and the rail network is extensive, rail has the largest market share for intercity travel. In much of Latin America,\nbus is the preferred mode even for distances greater than 600 miles. In the most developed countries, railways must\ncompete with air for longer distance travel and autos for shorter distance travel. Still, when railways are able to offer\nservice on the order of 100 mph along 200-300 mile corridors, they can capture more than half the non-auto market.\nExamples include Paris-London, Stockholm-Gothenburg, and Rome-Bologna. Where railways offer service in excess\nof 120 mph, they can dominate such markets, e.g. Paris-Brussels, Paris-Lyons, and Tokyo-Osaka. In the US, passenger\nrail services are highly competitive only for the Northeast Corridor, and rail market share is very low elsewhere.\n\nCompetition for intercity passenger services is based upon cost, time, and quality of the available services, which can\nbe modeled using the economic concept of utility. Travelers' utility can be increased by reducing costs, increasing\nspeed, or improving the quality of their experience. Travelers will choose the mode that allows them to reach their\ndestination with the greatest utility. Technological changes can improve utility for potential customers and therefore\nincrease market share, as demonstrated in this section.\n\nAir, bus and auto are the primary modes competing with rail for intercity passengers. For air, the key factors are the\ntime required at the terminal and the number of stops, as well as the actual flight time. For rail competitive trips (less\nthan 1,000 miles), flight time is at most several hours, often less than half the total trip time. Fares, access time,\nterminal processing and time and hassle associated with connections are key elements affecting travelers' utility.\n\nBus is much simpler than air or rail, as the terminal time and amenities are both minimal. The average trip time is\ndependent upon highway conditions and the number of stops. Travel by bus allows opportunities for work, and seats\nin the best buses are at least as comfortable as coach class on most planes. Design of bus networks is extremely\nflexible and readily integrated with air or rail networks.\n\nAuto travel is the most flexible, the most comfortable, and often appears the cheapest. Most people ignore depreciation\nand treat insurance and taxes as fixed or sunk costs, worrying only about out-of-pocket costs (fuel and tolls for personal\nautomobiles, plus daily fees and mileage fees for rental cars). Auto competition varies greatly across the world, in\nterms of availability, service, and cost. Where roads are poorly developed or extremely congested, auto is too slow\nfor anything but short trips. Where auto ownership is high and highways well-developed, auto is a convenient, cheap\n\n1 Martland, C.D., Alex Lu, Dalong Shi, Nand Sharma, Vimal Kumar, and Joseph Sussman. Performance-Based Technology\nScanning for Rail Passenger Systems. UIC/MIT-WP-2002-02. MIT, Cambridge, MA (July 2002).\n\noption for traveling quite long distances. In Europe and Japan, out-of-pocket costs are high because of tolls and fuel\ntaxes. In China, railways are losing mode share to autos and especially buses as the highway network is expanded.\n\nThe Utility of Time\n\nEconomists use the concept of utility as a means of understanding how people make economic decisions. People are\nassumed to make choices that maximize their utility, perhaps unconsciously, thus providing a basis for understanding\nand modeling the way people make choices. In principle, utility can encompass cost, travel time, comfort, and other\nfactors such as safety and security. Surveys and statistical methodologies can be used to develop models of utility\nbased upon user choices or their stated preferences. Assuming that such models exist, we can compare the utility\nassociated with using rail, air or other modes. If utility is identical for two modes, then we would expect travelers to\nbe indifferent to which mode they use. If utility varies with distance, there may be a breakeven distance at which\nmode shares will be equal. Models that estimate the percentage of travelers that will choose a particular mode are\ncalled travel demand models. These models are used extensively in evaluating transportation projects, as the predicted\nbenefits of any transportation project will depend heavily upon the demand for the new facility or service.\n\nSome general insights concerning utility have been gained from research on travel demand:\n\n-\nTrip times and reliability are important factors in addition to out-of-pocket cost.\n-\nValue of time is related to, but less than, the hourly wage and may depend upon mode or trip purpose.\n-\nTime spent in different activities is valued differently; time spent moving in a vehicle is generally less onerous\nthan time spent waiting in the terminal.\n-\nEase of access and ease of using the mode are important.\n-\nTime of day, trip purpose, and service frequency affect choice of departure and arrival times.\n\nThese results document great variations in value of the time for different groups of people in various activities. A\nstudy of intermodal facilities for intercity rail, bus, and transit facilities, suggested using 1/3 of the prevailing wage\nfor the travel time from home to work, 1/6 of the prevailing wage for non-work travel, and 200% of the prevailing\nwage for work-related travel.2\n\nStudies of demand typically use rather general independent variables, often just separating trip time into in-vehicle\nand out-of-vehicle time. A study of high speed rail conducted for the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration, for\nexample, used trip time, fares, and frequency of service in developing demand models for various market segments.3\nThat study addressed the potential markets for high speed rail as an alternative to air and auto travel; it defined service\nto be total trip time, without attempting to distinguish among the utility associated with different trip segments.\nHowever, since passengers make much finer distinctions concerning utility than this, it is necessary to make some\nassumption about passenger utility as part of PBTS.\n\nThe researchers in the UIC study assumed that time and comfort utilities can be expressed in monetary terms and\ncompared directly to fares and other out-of-pocket costs. They then made assumptions concerning utilities for\ndifferent segments of a trip in order to illustrate the relative importance of these segments and the opportunities for\ntechnological improvements. After all, it is clear to anyone who has ever traveled that the time spent in some portions\nof the trip is very onerous, while the time spent in other portions of the trip may be neutral or pleasant. Saving a few\nminutes in travel time by introducing faster trains may not be nearly as beneficial as using better information\ntechnology to save the same few minutes in terminal processing or providing in-vehicle communications and\nentertainment to make travel time more productive or more enjoyable.\n\n2 Horowitz, Alan and Nick Thompson, Evaluation of Intermodal Passenger Transfer Facilities. Final Report to the U.S. Federal\nHighway Administration, DOT-T-95-02. U.S. DOT Technology Sharing Program, Washington, D.C. (September 1994).\n3 Federal Railroad Administration,\"High-Speed Ground Transportation for America\", US Department of Transportation,\nWashington, DC, September 1997, pp. 5-10\n\nA Preliminary Model of Passenger Utility\nTo begin, consider how a business traveler with an average billable rate of $100/hour and a salary of $40 per hour\nmight view the various segment of an air trip:\n\n-\nDrive to airport, including buffer time required because of access unreliability: unproductive time valued at\n50% of the average salary or $20/hour\n-\nProcess time: standing in lines, checking-in, going through security, and boarding are not only unproductive,\nbut uncomfortable and stressful, so this time is valued at $50/hour\n-\nExtra time at the airport: conceivably useful for shopping, eating, or reading, but likely broken into segments\ntoo small to be productive; valued as somewhat better than driving at $10/hour\n-\nTime on the plane resting, eating (peanuts), waiting: similar to the time in the car, probably negative, but at\nsomething less than average salary, so this is valued at $20/hour\n-\nTime on the plane having fun: time spent watching a movie, eating (a real meal), or reading a book may be\nindistinguishable from time spent at home, so some of the time could be considered neutral, i.e. $0/hour\n-\nTime on the plane working: this could be billable time with a positive value of $100/hour\n\nThis individual would presumably associate similar utilities with the corresponding segments of a trip by rail, bus or\nautomobile, although the duration of similar segments could be quite different for each mode. If we break the\ncompeting travel options into logical trip segments and use consistent values of time for each activity, then we can\nestimate the utility associated with the various options available for any trip.\n\nLet's begin with a 250-mile trip, a distance long enough for rail to be competitive with auto and short enough to be\ncompetitive with air. Tables 1 to 3 give representative inputs for evaluating trip utility. These tables were copied\ndirectly from a PBTS model that was created in a spreadsheet. Table 1 shows sample inputs for calculating out-of-\npocket costs. To facilitate sensitivity analysis, some of the expense items have fixed and variable components. Air is\nthe most expensive ($289 one-way), automobile is the least expensive ($123)4, and rail is in the middle ($162). The\ntable also shows the time required to make a reservation, which is not an out-of-pocket expense, but which will affect\nutility.\n\nTable 2 shows the factors used to estimate total travel time, including access, terminals, and buffers sufficient to cover\nlikely delays. Non-stop air is the fastest, requiring 5.25 hours; rail and auto are nearly an hour longer. Table 3 shows\nhypothetical values of time that might be reasonable for a business traveler in the United States for the various\nactivities specified in Table 1; the final row shows the value per hour for the extra time gained by using the fastest\nmode. Most likely, the extra time is a net benefit to travelers at something close to their average value of time.\nHowever, it could be more or less. For a business traveler, the extra time might be spent with the client, leading to a\nhigher probability of having a successful meeting. Table 3 therefore shows that the extra time is worth $150/hour,\n50% higher than the value of work time for our hypothetical business traveler. Other travelers might have completely\ndifferent perspectives on the value of this extra time. For a student traveling home for the holidays, extra time on the\ntrain might be valuable time to finish an assignment - or it might mean missing the start of a great party. A vacation\ntraveler might lose 2% of the daylight hours available on the beach during the vacation - or gain time to finish up\nwork before relaxing on the beach.\n\n4 Some business travelers are reimbursed for their use of their own automobiles on company business. The travel allowance is\nlikely to be based upon the fully-allocated costs of owning and operating a car, which is on the order of $0.50 per mile. For a 500-\nmile round trip, a business traveler might therefore be reimbursed $250, which would be $100 more than the variable costs of gas,\ntolls, and wear-and-tear on the vehicle, estimated in Table 1 as $0.30/mile or $150 for a 500-mile trip. When passenger service was\ncancelled between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg in 2009, this factor was cited as a major reason for the lower than expected ridership:\nthe rail service was competing with the private service operated by the potential passengers themselves and subsidized by their\nemployers in the form of mileage reimbursement for use of their cars!\n\nTable 1 Calculating Out-of-Pocket Cost for Each Travel Option\n\nAir Non\nStop\nAir Via\nHub\nTrain\nAuto\nRental\nCar\nCircuity\n1.2\n1.1\n1.1\n1.15\nDistance 1 way\n287.5\nDays at destination\nReservations (hours)\n0.25\n0.25\n0.25\n0.1\nCost (1-way)\nAccess to station\n$4\n$4\n$4\n$4\nFare - fixed\n$100\n$50\n$25\nFare/mile\n$0.50\n$0.40\n$0.30\nExpenses/trip\n$40\nExpenses/mile\n$0.30\n$0.05\nExpenses/day\n$40\nAccess to destination\n$20\n$20\n$10\n$0\n$0\nParking per day\n$20\n$20\n$20\n$20\n$20\nTotal Out-of-Pocket Cost\n$289\n$234\n$162\n$123\n$178\n\nTable 2 Calculating Total Trip Time, by Mode\nAir Non\nStop\nAir Via\nHub\nTrain\nAuto\nRental\nCar\nTime for trip\nAccess to station\n0.75\n0.75\n0.5\n0.5\nBuffer for access unreliability\n0.25\n0.25\n0.2\nProcess time\n0.1\n0.15\n0.25\nQueue time\n0.25\n0.35\nAvailable time in station\n0.5\n1.5\n0.25\nBoarding time\n0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0.2\nTravel time - fixed\n0.75\n1.5\n0.2\nTravel time - per 100 miles\n0.2\n0.2\n1.25\nTotal travel time in vehicle\n1.25\n2.1\n3.64\n5.5\n5.75\nTravel time - work %\n75%\n75%\n75%\n0%\n0%\nTravel time - entertainment %\n0%\n0%\n0%\n10%\n10%\nTravel time - rest & other %\n25%\n25%\n25%\n90%\n90%\nTravel time - work\n0.94\n1.58\n2.73\nTravel time - entertainment\n0.55\n0.58\nTravel time - rest & other\n0.31\n0.53\n0.91\n4.95\n5.18\nExit time from vehicle\n0.2\n0.4\n0.2\n0.25\nExit time from station\n0.25\n0.25\n0.1\nAccess to destination\n0.5\n0.25\n0.25\nBuffer for access unreliability\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.25\n0.25\nTotal time\n5.25\n7.65\n6.09\n7.45\n\nTable 3 Hypothetical Value of Time, by Mode and Type of Activity\n\nAir Non\nStop\nAir Via\nHub\nTrain\nAuto\nRental\nCar\nReservations\nTime for trip\nAccess to station\nBuffer for access unreliability\nProcess time\nQueue time\nAvailable time in station\nBoarding time\nTravel time - work\n-100\n-100\n-100\n-100\n-100\nTravel time - entertainment\nTravel time - rest & other\nExit time from vehicle\nExit time from station\nAccess to destination\nBuffer for access unreliability\nExtra travel time\n\nWith these detailed inputs concerning travel time and the value of time, it is possible to estimate our traveler's utility\nfor each mode (Table 4). Time is shown as a \"disutility\" so that it has the same sign as cost - the mode with the lowest\ndisutility is therefore the preferred mode. The quality of time spent traveling is clearly important; ranking the available\noptions in terms of their disutility gives much different results than ranking by either out-of-pocket costs or time. In\nparticular, rail looks much better, because there is extra time for work and less for processing and access. Although\nrail takes an hour longer, its disutility is less than the disutility of flying. For someone who can work on the train,\ndriving is not a good option. Renting a car, which looks good in terms of direct cost, is by far the worst choice; it\ntakes time to rent the car and it is usually impossible to work in the car, so the disutility of the time is quite high\nrelative to train or plane.\n\nThis particular example emphasizes the importance of \"work time\" to the decision and shows that the cumulative\nbenefits of lower terminal time, easier processing, and greater accessibility help rail relative to air travel (but hurt rail\nrelative to driving your own car). It also suggests a framework for comparing technologies or projects. Any intercity\nmarket will have groups of travelers with diverse needs and values. Some people may be able to think effectively\nwhen driving, so they may look forward to having several quiet hours in a car. Vacation travelers are concerned with\nbaggage handling facilities - but day trippers are not. Self-employed businessmen undoubtedly view time and costs\nof travel far more carefully than corporate travelers, whose personal finances are unaffected by their travel choices.\nThe value of terminal services depends upon the expectations of the customer. Hungry students devour fast food, as\nlong as it is cheap and plentiful; wealthy couples en route to a resort prefer to pass an extra hour enjoying a fine meal;\na \"road warrior\" might grab pizza and a beer and check e-mail. The next section considers how passengers in four\nmarket segments might respond to various changes in mode or trip characteristics.\n\nTable 4 Hypothetical Disutility of Travel, by Mode\n\nAir Non\nStop\nAir Via\nHub\nTrain\nAuto\nRental\nCar\nDirect Costs\n$289\n$234\n$162\n$123\n$178\nReservations\n$13\n$13\n$13\n$0\n$5\nTravel time\nAccess to station\n$15\n$15\n$10\n$0\n$10\nBuffer for access unreliability\n$5\n$5\n$4\n$0\n$0\nProcess time\n$5\n$8\n$0\n$0\n$13\nQueue time\n$13\n$18\n$0\n$0\n$0\nAvailable time in station\n$5\n$15\n$3\n$0\n$0\nBoarding time\n$10\n$20\n$10\n$0\n$10\nTravel time - work\n-$94\n-$158\n-$273\n$0\n$0\nTravel time - entertainment\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\nTravel time - rest & other\n$6\n$11\n$18\n$198\n$259\nExit time from vehicle\n$10\n$20\n$10\n$0\n$0\nExit time from station\n$13\n$13\n$5\n$0\n$0\nAccess to destination\n$50\n$50\n$25\n$13\n$13\nBuffer for access unreliability\n$5\n$5\n$5\n$3\n$3\nExtra travel time\n$0\n$360\n$126\n$113\n$330\nTotal travel time disutility\n$43\n$381\n-$58\n$326\n$636\nTotal disutility\n$344\n$627\n$117\n$448\n$820\n\nEstimating Mode Shares\n\nGiven the utilities (or disutilities) for each available mode, it is possible to estimate mode shares using what is called\na logit model. The mode share for mode j is calculated as follows:\n\n(Eq. 1)\nMode Share = (e-disutility mode j/scale factor) / ( e-disutility mode k/scale factor )\n\nThis type of model is commonly used in travel demand studies. If the disutility of two modes is within 5 or 10%, they\neach have a sizeable market share; if the disutility of one mode is much greater, then it has a very minor share of the\nmarket. The scale factor was assumed to be 25% of the average disutility of the mode with the lowest disutility for\neach market segment. This factor determines how strongly mode shares vary with the relative costs.\n\nThe base case for the sensitivity analysis added three market segments to the example from the prior section: general\nbusiness, vacation, and student. The latter three market segments have values of time that are 50%, 25%, and 10% of\nthe values for the executive considered above. Each market segment was assumed to have an equal number of\ntravelers.\n\nSix cases were investigated in addition to the base case (Table 5). The first two considered airline strategies:\n\nCase 1 - Discount Air Fares: a new carrier enters the market, halving air fares, but doubling processing\ntimes. Rail retains more than half the market, because the trip is too short for air speed to make much\ndifference. Since business travelers expect to be productive, the rail option still looks good.\n\nCase 2 - Business Shuttles: major airlines introduce a service aimed at business travelers. Fares match the\ndiscount airlines, but processing, queuing and wait times are halved. This service captures more than 90%\nof the business market. Vacationers also appreciate the time savings; more than half switch to air. Students,\nstill searching for the best deal, divide fairly evenly among the two air modes, rail, and auto. Overall rail\nmarket share plummets to 10%.\n\nTable 5 Sensitivity Analysis for Mode Share\nAir Non\nStop\nAir Via\nHub\nTrain\nAuto\nRental\nCar\nBase Case\n2%\n1%\n67%\n29%\n1%\nDiscount Air Fares\n18%\n3%\n56%\n22%\n1%\nBusiness Shuttle\n72%\n9%\n10%\n9%\n1%\nLower Rail Fares\n58%\n14%\n24%\n4%\n0%\nHigh Speed Rail\n40%\n12%\n43%\n4%\n0%\nEasy Access\n17%\n8%\n71%\n3%\n0%\nTwo Travelers\n2%\n0%\n54%\n40%\n4%\nEasy Rail & Business Shuttle\n125 miles\n7%\n4%\n69%\n20%\n1%\n250 miles\n17%\n8%\n71%\n3%\n0%\n375 miles\n35%\n12%\n51%\n1%\n0%\n500 miles\n56%\n16%\n27%\n0%\n0%\n625 miles\n68%\n19%\n13%\n0%\n0%\n\nThe next three cases address possible rail responses to the business shuttle. Each helps retain market share, with the\ngreatest benefits for this particular example coming from improving access:\n\nCase 3 - Lower Rail Fares: railways respond to the shuttle by cutting fares by 20%. Executives don't even\nnotice the change; the other groups increase their rail mode share to a quarter or a third. Overall, the rail\nshare recovers to 24% of the market.\n\nCase 4 - High Speed Rail: average rail operating speed is 150 mph rather than 80mph. This is more\nsuccessful than simply lowering fares, and rail is projected to gain 43% of the market. However, a major\nproject would be needed to achieve such high speeds and it is unclear if prices could remain unchanged.\n\nCase 5 - Easy Access: the average speed is again 80mph, but times are halved for rail processing, access,\nand reservations, while better on-board seating and services increases the value of time by 20% for business\ntravelers. The value of terminal and on-board entertainment time is increased for everyone with more\nentertainment, retail and culinary opportunities in the stations and better food and services on the train.\nExecutives are assumed to increase their working time from 70 to 80% of the trip time. The results are very\nstrong for the railways, which become dominant in the first three markets and capture a third of the students.\n\nSometimes a group is traveling:\n\nCase 6 - Two Travelers: travelers share the cost of auto trips or cab rides. The dominant result is to make\ndriving a very good option, with almost all air traffic and more than 20% of the rail traffic diverting to auto.\nRental cars also improve, increasing their share from 1 to 4% and becoming a good option for vacationers\n\nand students. Clearly, if a family is going on vacation with children, the automobile will look better for even\nlonger distances. Likewise, if three or four people are traveling together on business, then renting a car may\nlook better, particularly if they can conduct some business while driving.\n\nDistance is obviously another key factor for sensitivity analysis, as rail works best for distances that are rather long\nfor highway travel, yet rather short for airlines. \"Easy Access vs. the Air Shuttle\" was used as the base case. For the\n125-mile trip, rail captured 69% and autos took 20% of the market. For the 250-mile trip, the highway modes\nessentially drop out and direct air flights capture 17% of the market. As distances increase to 625 miles, the rail share\ndrops steadily, while the air share grows. Air travel via a hub is increasingly attractive for the longer distances, as the\ncost savings become large enough to justify the additional time.\n\nImplications for Carriers and Terminal Operators\n\nThe implications of utility analysis are generally well understood. There is value in reducing travel time, in\nminimizing process time, and in increasing passenger comfort. There is value in providing a variety of ways for\ntravelers to spend their time and their money. Carriers attempt to capture this value by offering premium services at\nhigher prices. First class and business class travelers enjoy quicker check-in, comfortable and productive waiting\nareas, larger seats and better food - and they are willing to pay a premium of $100-$200 per flight hour for these\nprivileges. This premium is high compared to the coach fare, but not unrealistic when compared to executive salaries\nor consulting rates. Carriers also advertise their on-board services, including telephones, movies, games, magazines,\nand shopping opportunities.\n\nTerminal operators may have been slower to understand the importance of time and utility, but they have certainly\nresponded well over the past 10-20 years. New airports feature greatly enlarged shopping opportunities, food courts,\nfine restaurants, lounges, TVs, internet access, ATMs and other amenities that make waiting time more valuable to\nthe traveler (and more profitable to the terminal owner). Government agencies and airlines are also concerned about\nairport access, recognizing the importance of time and comfort to the user as well as the costs of the infrastructure.\nSimilar trends have affected some major train stations, which now offer varied retail and dining opportunities\n\nImplications for Project Selection and Project Evaluation\n\nThis example shows how markedly different technologies and types of projects can be compared in terms of their\npotential effects on passengers' utility. The most striking comparisons are among the three generic responses to the\nbusiness shuttle for the 250-mile trip (Cases 3-5). Lower fares could be interpreted as investments in any of the many\ntechnologies that might reduce cost while leaving service and access unchanged. High speed rail is of course a\ndominant theme in the evolution of rail technology, in rail R&D, and in proposals for rail investment. Easy access\nrelates to entirely different types of projects, including not only improvements in terminal processing, but also\nimprovements in terminal access. For this example, access is somewhat more important than train speed, and much\nmore important than cost reduction. In general, saving time in access and processing or allowing more productive use\nof time may be more effective - for the customer - than saving time by running faster.\n\nThe rail industry and public agencies are well aware of the potential for high-speed rail systems to attract traffic from\ncongested airports and highways, and extensive R&D and investment programs are in place to advance such systems.\nIn the U.S., the \"next Generation High-Speed Rail Technology Demonstration Program\" was funded at more than $25\nmillion annually in fiscal 2001 and 2002, exceeding the rest of the FRA's budget both passenger and freight R&D5.\nHowever, as demonstrated in this case study, higher speed is not the only way to reduce travel time or to enhance\ntravelers' utility, and quite different kinds of technologies and projects may be equally effective in enhancing rail\ncompetitiveness.\n\n5 Federal Railroad Administration, \"Five Year Strategic Plan for Railroad Research, Development, and Demonstration\", Chapter\n8, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington D.C., 2002\n\nThis PBTS analysis shows that train speed is only one factor, and perhaps a relatively minor factor influencing\ntravelers' decisions. Total door-to-door trip time, the quality of time spent in each portion of the trip, and the\nopportunity to use the time for enjoyable or profitable activities are all very important factors. Comfortable trains\noperating over a dense network at reasonably frequent intervals can compete effectively with both air and auto for\ntrips of 100 to 500 miles.\n\nFigure 1 Dublin Train Station\n\nCase Study\nReducing Risks Associated with Grade Crossing Accidents\n\nThis case study shows how cost-effectiveness can be used in conjunction with probabilistic risk\nassessment to determine the best ways to reduce one category of risks of associated with\ntransportation systems.\n\nHundreds of people are killed each year in grade crossing accidents. A grade crossing (also known as a level crossing\nin some countries) is where a road crosses a railroad at grade, so that it is possible for a train and a highway vehicle\nto collide. Accidents may by caused by people who are too sleepy or too drunk to notice that they are approaching a\ncrossing or by people whose car is stuck in traffic while trying to get across the tracks or whose car breaks down on\nthe crossing. A few accidents are caused by malfunctioning of the signals, and a great many are caused by people\nwho ignore the warnings and try to beat the train across the intersection.\n\nThe probability of such an accident occurring varies primarily with the density of rail traffic and with the type of\nprotection that is available. At a crossing equipped with flashing lights, the probability of an accident is on the order\nof 2 per million trains. If there are 20 trains per day, then the expected number of accidents per year would be (20\ntrains/day x 365 days per year/1 million trains) x (2 accidents per million trains) = 0.0146 accidents per year for such\na crossing. For a rail route with 100 such crossings, the expected number of accidents per year would be 0.0146 (100)\n= 1.46. Although the probability of an accident at any crossing is very low, the likelihood of an accident somewhere\nalong this route is quite high. In fact, such accidents are not uncommon. In the United State, there are more than a\nquarter million grade crossings and thousands of grade crossing accidents per year.\n\nThe second step in estimating risk is to determine the expected consequences if an accident occurs. Even a small\npassenger train weighs hundreds of tons, so that the consequences of a collision between a train and an automobile\nare very predictable. The car will be destroyed, any people who fail to get out of the car are likely to be killed or\nseverely injured, and the locomotive may sustain some minor damage. In addition, the engineer and anyone else in\nthe cab of the train will be suffering an emotional shock after a) knowing that the accident was about to happen and\nb) being completely unable to stop a train in time to avoid hitting someone trying to sneak across before the train\narrives. If the train is a passenger train, the major consequence for most passengers will be a delay to the train;\npassengers might not even notice the impact and will simply wonder why the train stopped.\n\nAccident rates at grade crossings can be reduced by installing flashing lights, putting in crossing gates (arms that\nautomatically come down and block the travel lane when a train approaches), by installing 4-quadrant gates (4 arms\nblock the entire road, so that motorists cannot run around the gate), or by building a bridge. It is even possible to\nhave the entire road blocked, while uniformed personnel ensure that pedestrians do not try to skip across in front of a\ntrain, but this expensive solution can only be justified in very unusual circumstances.\n\nTable 1 shows the cost of installing (or upgrading) to each level of protection along with typical accident rates achieved\nwith this type of protection. Note that the accident rate is driven (in this simplified model, but also in reality) by train\ntraffic, not by highway traffic.\n\nTable 1 Grade Crossing Accident Rates\n\nProtection\nCost/crossing\nAccident Rate (per\nmillion trains)\nSigns only\n$500\nFlashing lights\n$20,000\nGates\n$100,000\n4-quadrant gates\n$200,000\n0.2\nBridge\n$2,000,000\n\nAssume that you are the safety officer in a state Department of Transportation, and you have a budget for improving\nhighway safety. You would like to use some of this budget to reduce crossing accidents. You have categorized\ncrossings into the categories shown in Table 1. With this information, you can calculate the cost effectiveness for\neach strategy in reducing accidents and identify the most cost effective strategies to pursue.\n\nTable 2 Possible Upgrades\nHighway Traffic\nper year\n\nTrains per\nYear\nBase Acc.\n/year\nCurrent\nProtection\nPossible\nUpgrade\n20 million\n100,000\n0.1\nGates\nBridge\n20 million\n100,000\n0.1\nGates\n4-quadrant\n2 million\n50,000\n0.05\nGates\n4-quadrant\n200,000\n50,000\n0.1\nFlashing\nlights\nGates\n20 million\n5,000\n0.01\nFlashing\nlights\nGates\n20,000\n2,000\n0.02\nSigns\nFlashing lights\n20,000\n0.002\nSigns\nFlashing lights\n\nThe first step is to estimate the effect of the upgrade on accident rates and the number of accidents per year for each\ncategory of crossing. The new accident rate per million trains comes directly from Table 1. The expected accidents\nper year is the product of the new accident rate per million trains multiplied by the number of trains per year. For\nexample, if 4-quadrant gates are installed for crossings with 20 million highway vehicles and 100,000 trains per year,\nthen we can expect the accident rate to drop to 0.2 per million trains, while the expected number of accidents per year\nwill be 0.2 accidents per million trains multiplied by 0.1 million trains/year or 0.02 accidents per year.\n\nThe next step is to compute the cost-effectiveness, which is the cost per annual reduction in accidents. This can readily\nbe calculated as the cost of the upgrade divided by the number of accidents avoided. The accidents avoided per year\nis calculated as the difference between the base and the new number of accidents per year. The cost of the upgrade\nis shown above in Table 2. The result is the cost per accident avoided. The most cost-effective measures turn out to\nbe:\n\n1) Install flashing lights at crossings with 2,000 trains per year that are currently only protected by signs ($1.25\nmillion per accident avoided per year)\n2) Install gates at crossings with 50,000 trains per year that are currently only protected by flashing lights ($2\nmillion per accident avoided per year)\n3) Install 4-quadrant gates at the very busy crossings with 100,000 trains per year ($2.5 million per accident avoided\nper year.\n\nAs the safety officer for the state department of transportation, you would still have to determine whether there are\nmore cost-effective strategies to pursue in terms of reducing risks within your state. To do this, you would have to\nhave an estimate of the consequences of grade crossing accidents, so that you could calculate cost-effectiveness in\nterms of risk reduction rather than in terms of accident reduction. You could then compare strategies for reducing\nrisks at grade crossings to strategies such as adding more policemen to enforce speed limits, requiring seat belts, or\nupgrading dangerous highway intersections.\n\nEquivalence Factors for Selected Discount Rate\n\nThe first section of each table shows the equivalence factors for present value P given future value F assuming i% discount rate\nover a period of N years (which is denoted as [P/F,i%,N]). The next two sections show the annuity value A given present value P\n[A/P,i%,N] and future value F given the annuity value A [F/A, i%,N]assuming discount rates of 6% to 12% over periods of 5 to 40\nyears.\n\nDiscount Rate:\n6%\n\n[P/F,i%,N]\n[A/P,i%,N]\n[F/A,i%,N]\n0.7473\n0.2374\n5.6371\n0.5584\n0.1359\n13.1808\n0.4173\n0.1030\n23.2760\n0.3118\n0.0872\n36.7856\n0.2330\n0.0782\n54.8645\n0.1741\n0.0726\n79.0582\n0.1301\n0.0690\n111.4348\n0.0972\n0.0665\n154.7620\n\nDiscount Rate:\n8%\n\n[P/F,i%,N]\n[A/P,i%,N]\n[F/A,i%,N]\n0.6806\n0.2505\n5.8666\n0.4632\n0.1490\n14.4866\n0.3152\n0.1168\n27.1521\n0.2145\n0.1019\n45.7620\n0.1460\n0.0937\n73.1059\n0.0994\n0.0888\n113.2832\n0.0676\n0.0858\n172.3168\n0.0460\n0.0839\n259.0565\n\nDiscount Rate:\n10%\n\n[P/F,i%,N]\n[A/P,i%,N]\n[F/A,i%,N]\n0.6209\n0.2638\n6.1051\n0.3855\n0.1627\n15.9374\n0.2394\n0.1315\n31.7725\n0.1486\n0.1175\n57.2750\n0.0923\n0.1102\n98.3471\n0.0573\n0.1061\n164.4940\n0.0356\n0.1037\n271.0244\n0.0221\n0.1023\n442.5926\n\nDiscount Rate:\n12%\n\n[P/F,i%,N]\n[A/P,i%,N]\n[F/A,i%,N]\n0.5674\n0.2774\n6.3528\n0.3220\n0.1770\n17.5487\n0.1827\n0.1468\n37.2797\n0.1037\n0.1339\n72.0524\n0.0588\n0.1275\n133.3\n0.0334\n0.1241\n241.3\n0.0189\n0.1223\n431.7\n0.0107\n0.1213\n767.1\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Project Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies\nCarl D.

      "content": "Further Reading\nI love projects, don't you?\n(Luther Billis, in South Pacific by Rogers and Hammerstein)\nMany books and articles delve into the history of infrastructure projects and systems, highlighting the personalities of\nchampions and opponents, the needs addressed by the project, the technologies used, the trials and tribulations that\nwere faced, and the ultimate achievements. This bibliography lists books and articles that I have enjoyed, and I suspect\nthat there are many more. Reading about past projects, including failures as well as successes, will provide a valuable\ncontext for anyone involved or interested in project evaluation and infrastructure systems. We can all learn from the\nsuccesses and failures of those who have gone before us. The best options are not always chosen, the long-term\nimpacts are not always considered, and the process is not always transparent, objective, or even rational. Nevertheless,\nmany great projects have been built, many bad proposals have been rejected, and many innovations have helped to\nmake infrastructure systems perform better.\nBooks about Infrastructure Projects and Programs\nAl Naib, S.K., London Docklands Past, present and future: An illustrated guide to history, heritage and regeneration.\nResearch Books, Romford, Esses RM6 5BY, Great Britain. (The docklands were originally constructed as port\nfacilities in London for Great Britain's extensive international trade.

      "content": "Introduction\n\"Focus first on those aspects of infrastructure that provide essential services, that is, those involving\ndrinking water, wastewater, transportation, energy, and communications. ... Business and population\ngrowth have already outpaced the capacity of existing systems. To meet user's expectations, planners\nshould first determine the public's expectations with respect to the levels and resiliency of such\nservices and the amount of money that should be spent to maintain them and then determine what\nalternatives exist and what actions need to be taken to meet those expectations.\"1\nToward More Sustainable Infrastructure: Better Projects and Better Programs\nModern societies depend upon vast infrastructure-based systems that support efficient transportation and\ncommunications, provide ample supplies of clean water and energy, and enable effective treatment and disposal of\nwastes.\nThe performance of such systems can be measured in terms of many factors, including cost, energy\nconsumption, resource requirements, capacity, service quality, safety, impacts on society, and impacts on the\nenvironment. Performance can also be measured in terms of sustainability, a broad concept that refers to the ability\nof a system to perform well over a very long period of time.\nSustainability is a particular concern for systems that rely heavily on non-renewable resources and systems that result\nin severe degradation of the environment. However, troubles in any aspect of performance can limit the sustainability\nof an infrastructure-based system. Sustainability can be enhanced by reducing costs, improving social and economic\nbenefits, restricting the use of fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources, or reducing negative social and\nenvironmental impacts.\nMany infrastructure projects and programs are aimed at improving some aspect of sustainability. Some are designed\nto ensure that the system continues to function properly. If infrastructure is inadequate or poorly managed, people\nmay suffer from congestion, high costs, pollution, economic stagnation, or environmental degradation. To limit such\nproblems, on-going investments may be required in new facilities, better materials, or new management techniques,\nalthough the nature of the infrastructure may remain about the same. Highways in 2016 may have real-time\ninformation signs, better paving materials, and synchronized traffic signals, but they still look and function much as\nhighways did 50 years ago.\nOther infrastructure projects and programs are designed to replace or upgrade systems that for some reason have\nbecome obsolete or non-sustainable. Over time, as economies develop, as societal norms change, and as certain\nresources become less available, the demands on infrastructure systems will change along with public perceptions of\ninfrastructure performance. If infrastructure systems fail to evolve, they may eventually be recognized as being too\ncostly, unsafe, disruptive to society, or overly-damaging to the natural environment. At that point, new systems are\nneeded. For example, solar power and wind power can produce electricity that otherwise would have required\nadditional power plants and more imported oil.\nIn short, infrastructure projects and programs are designed to improve some aspect of system performance. Better\nprojects and better programs will lead to more sustainable infrastructure. The problem is how to determine which\nprojects and which programs are better.\n1 One of the conclusions of Sustainable Critical Infrastructure - A Framework for Meeting 21st Century Imperatives, a report based\nupon a May 2008 workshop sponsored by the National Research Council (\"Report Urges New Framework for Planning Critical\nInfrastructure.\" Civil Engineering. June 2009. p. 20.)\n\nInfrastructure Projects and Programs\nInfrastructure projects include large-scale, multi-dimensioned, long-term investments in transportation systems,\nbuildings, water resources, communications, power generation, parks, schools, and other public services. Such\nprojects always have multiple objectives, they will often be controversial, and people with many different perspectives\nmust come together to complete the projects and make them successful. Such projects have important impacts for the\npublic at large, because they will affect the environment, our society, and our economic prosperity.\nA program\nconsists of a set of related projects, such as the Interstate Highway Program or a program designed to promote\ninvestment in wind power.\nHistorically, there have been numerous large-scale infrastructure projects and programs, some brilliant, some\nmisguided, and many of them quite interesting for planners and engineers, such as the Panama Canal and skyscrapers\nin Manhattan. Projects like these affect the way we live, they are the backbone of much of our history, and they are\nthe pathway to our future.\nThis book is about understanding where projects come from, how they are evaluated, how decisions are made to\nproceed with them, and what separates good projects from bad projects. This book spends considerable time on\nmethodology, especially the methods of engineering economics that can be used to understand how projects are\nfinanced, but it also provides real-world examples and case studies that convey some of the flavor, excitement, and\nchallenge of designing, evaluating, and implementing projects.\nFigure 1\nThe Panama Canal\nAfter decades of frustration, tens of\nthousands of deaths from tropical disease,\nbankruptcy and disgrace for the initial\nFrench Canal Company, the canal was\nfinally was completed in 1914 and remains\ntoday a critical link in global transport and\na highly profitable enterprise for Panama.\nImplementing, operating and maintaining infrastructure requires planners and engineers to work with bankers,\nentrepreneurs, politicians, community leaders and the public in order to meet society's needs more effectively.\nPlanners and engineers must learn to deal with the social, financial, and environmental issues related to infrastructure\nprojects, and these issues will become more important over time.\nEngineers are likely to start out building and\ndesigning projects, and many engineers spend their entire careers concentrating on these activities. Planners and\n\nmanagers are likely to start out working at a low level on projects and programs that were begun years ago. However,\nsomeone, somewhere, is trying to figure out what to build next, when and where to build it, and how to convince\ninvestors and governments to pay for it. Actually, there are many such people, and some of them are destined to\nbecome famous. These people may end up proposing projects, or they may simply define problems and convince\nother people to begin working on them.\nEngineers, planners and managers naturally expect to work on large-scale infrastructure projects. To succeed and to\nadvance in their professions, they will need to understand the big picture - the needs of society - in order to take the\nlead in designing, implementing or marketing new technologies or new systems. Leaders will need a broader outlook\non problems than is ordinarily conveyed in an engineering subject or a textbook on finance. They will need to\nunderstand how projects begin, how they are sold to the public, and how they become successful. They will need to\ncombine engineering or planning skills with marketing, financial, and communications skills. Anyone who grasps\nthis broader outlook will have a chance to become involved in projects and programs that are increasingly complex,\nwith more possibilities for design and implementation strategy, less certainty regarding the outcomes, and greater need\nfor imagination and leadership.\nInfrastructure is usually defined in terms of public systems, and constructing and maintaining infrastructure is an on\ngoing process and problem for local and national governments. Infrastructure refers to the physical systems that\nprovide transportation, water, buildings, and other public facilities that are needed to meet basic societal needs. These\nfacilities are needed by people regardless of their level of economic development. When infrastructure is not present\nor does not work properly, it is impossible to provide basic services such as food distribution, shelter, medical care,\nand safe drinking water. Maintaining infrastructure is a constant and expensive process that often is neglected in favor\nof more attractive political goals.\nIn practice, much of the civil infrastructure may be owned and maintained by private companies or individuals. Much\ninfrastructure was originally built by private corporations with licenses or other authorization from government;\nprivate toll roads were the norm in the United States in the early 19th century, and private expressways are being built\ntoday in many parts of the world. Many railroad systems are privately owned and operated. Large office buildings\nor apartment buildings are mostly privately owned, and they are certainly part of the basic infrastructure of a modern\ncity.\nProject evaluation may involve assessment of proposed options for creating, maintaining, rehabilitating or\ndecommissioning any kind of infrastructure, whether carried out by the public sector, the private sector or a\npublic/private partnership. Thus, building a new road, adding a lane to an existing road, or paving an existing road\ncould all be considered infrastructure projects. For administrative convenience, a large project will often be broken\ndown into multiple smaller projects. The construction of a new road may involve construction of a dozen bridges,\nthree major interchanges, extensive cut-and-fill operations to prepare the right-of-way, and eventually the actual\npaving of the road. Moreover, the road may be completed in multiple phases over a period of many years. Whether\nto consider each of these activities as a separate project, each phase as a separate project, or the entire road as a single\nproject could be debated; there will certainly be a well-defined set of contracts and sub-contracts so that all of the\ncontractors have a clear perspective on their portion of the overall project. The public, however, will likely view the\nwhole road construction as a single, multi-phased project. The distinction is usually unimportant, although there will\nbe times that a small segment of a road (or a small portion of some other project) will be proposed, hoping to gain\napproval more easily later on for an extension after \"getting your toe in the door\".\nAn infrastructure program may be established as a way to manage a series of projects or a way to simplify the design\nand approval process for multiple projects. A program may specify goals and criteria for measuring progress against\nthose goals. It may also specify what kinds of projects will qualify to be included in the program and what kinds of\nincentives will be available to qualifying projects. For example, a state may establish a program aimed at attracting\nprivate investment in housing for low-income families. The program may provide subsidies, tax relief, or other\nbenefits to projects that qualify according to the criteria specified in the legislation or regulations. A company may\nalso have infrastructure programs; retailers such as Home Depot or Wal-Mart will have plans for expanding their\n\nnetwork of stores and warehouses. A railroad may have a plan for upgrading its oldest bridges on certain high density\nlines; each bridge renewal would become a separate project as a part of the program. Cities and states may have\nprograms aimed at providing housing for the elderly or for low-income residents, and they may have programs aimed\nat improving water supplies or sewage treatment facilities. The various interest groups and political leaders who favor\nor oppose a certain type of project will fight over the structure of a program, perhaps for many years, but eventually\nthey may reach agreement about the objectives, scope, funding amounts, and funding eligibility for the program. Once\na program has been established, those prolonged fights will cease, and projects can rather quickly be identified,\napproved, and implemented. It will be desirable from time to time to review programs to ensure that the objectives\nremain valid, that the funding mechanisms are adequate and fair, and that the projects as implemented under the\nprogram actually have been achieving the program's objectives.\nInfrastructure projects and programs have several common and very interesting aspects:\n-\nInfrastructure is intended to last a very long time, so it is necessary to compare what may be very large current\nexpenses with the potential for benefits that will be gained only over a period of decades.\n-\nInfrastructure influences and perhaps defines the location and land use of cities and regions, so the location\nof infrastructure will have long-term implications for local and regional land use.\n-\nInfrastructure often involves networks of facilities that are widely dispersed, perhaps with severe\nconsequences for the environment or for the people who live where the networks are located.\n-\nInfrastructure benefits are frequently qualitative or difficult to measure, e.g. mobility, safety, air quality, or\nthe availability of clean water.\n-\nInfrastructure projects and programs will be of great concern to many different groups of people, including\ndevelopers, the public, special interest groups (some of which may be public interest groups and some of\nwhich may be supporting very narrow private interests), governments (including elected officials, regulatory\nofficials, and administrative officials), lawyers, users, abutters, construction companies, and investors.\n-\nInfrastructure is costly to build and costly to maintain.\nThe long lives expected for infrastructure cannot be achieved unless funding is available for proper management,\nincluding safe operating practices, on-going inspection and maintenance, and periodic renewal and upgrades. Without\nsuch funding, infrastructure systems will deteriorate and eventually be unable to meet the societal needs they were\ndesigned to serve. Without adequate funds for renewal and expansion, it will be impossible to meet growing needs\nfor services or to capture the benefits of new technologies.\nAdequate financing must therefore be considered an essential factor in improving the sustainability of infrastructure\nsystems, where \"sustainability\" refers to the ability of a system to function long into the future. Poorly managed\ninfrastructure systems that steadily deteriorate, become congested, or become unsafe clearly are not sustainable.\nHowever, adequate financing is but one of the major factors affecting the sustainability of infrastructure.\nLarge-scale infrastructure, even if it appears to be adequately financed, can only be sustained over long periods of\ntime if it is supported by society and the resources it requires are available at a reasonable cost. If infrastructure\nrequires excessive use of non-renewable resources, if it requires too much water or energy, or if its use results in\ndevastation of the environment, then the lack of resources, increasing costs of materials, or public outrage will force\nchanges. If construction, maintenance, and operations continually disrupt neighborhoods, cause human suffering, or\nexpose people to potentially catastrophic risks, then society will be reluctant to support further expansion of that kind\nof infrastructure.\nOver time, social norms may change, the costs of resources may vary, and new technologies may emerge. What one\ngeneration viewed as highly beneficial investments may be viewed as dubious achievements or even disasters by\nfollowing generations. Infrastructure systems must evolve along with society, and rising concerns about public safety,\npublic health, climate change, pollution, environmental decline mean that society will require more sustainable\ninfrastructure.\nWater shortages, highway fatalities, urban congestion, over-dependence upon fossil fuels, toxic\nchemicals associated with large-scale agriculture, acid rain, oil spills, and excessive amounts of solid waste are all\n\nsymptoms of problems that reflect a need for more sustainable infrastructure and a more sustainable way of life.\nChallenges such as those posed by climate change, oil depletion, collapse of fisheries, and large numbers of\nendangered species combine to make stewardship of the environment and sustainable development greater concerns\nfor society.\nAchieving more sustainable infrastructure will require thought, innovation, planning, financing, regulation, and\nleadership. There clearly is a continuing need for large investments in infrastructure, and there will be many\nopportunities for evaluating projects and programs related to all types of infrastructure. Evaluating projects and\nprograms will require methodologies for comparing current and future impacts, for considering multiple objectives,\nfor assessing both quantitative and qualitative information, and for communicating and negotiating with diverse\ngroups of people.\nEvaluating Infrastructure Projects\nThe main goal of project evaluation is to help in identifying and implementing successful projects and programs.\nFrom an overall perspective, a project is successful if:\n1. It was built, which proved that construction was feasible from engineering, financial, and social perspectives.\n2. The benefits were indeed greater than the costs.\n3. The project as built was an effective way to achieve those benefits.\n4. The project was built in an efficient and effective manner:\na.\nThere were no clearly better options.\nb. There were no significant negative externalities.\n5. Building this project did not foreclose other, even better projects.\nDifferent participants might have far narrower definitions of success. Did the engineers design a building that was\nsafe? Did the contractors get paid? Did clean water actually come to the neighborhoods? Did the mayor get re\nelected? These different perspectives must of course be considered in evaluating projects, but it is useful for students,\nconsultants, concerned citizens, honorable developers, and honest politicians to pay some attention to the overall\nissues.\nProject evaluation is a qualitative process as much as it is a quantitative one. A critical step is to create a \"story\" for\nthe project that can be used to explain why the project is needed, what it will do, what the benefits and costs will be,\nand why this is the best way to proceed. There will certainly be quantitative aspects to the process, although estimates\nof costs and benefits may be rather ill-defined and subject to debate.\nImplementing and maintaining a project over a long period of time will require:\n-\nFinancing: sufficient income to cover expenses, whether the income comes from user fees, investors,\nsubsidies, or contractual payments.\n-\nGovernment approvals: licensing and periodic inspections to ensure compliance with safety, environmental,\nand other regulatory matters.\n-\nEngineering skills: sufficient knowledge and skilled manpower to conduct the maintenance and rehabilitation\nnecessary to perform at an acceptable level of service.\n-\nResources: people and materials as required for maintenance and operations and whatever additional\nresources are needed by users (e.g. asphalt for highway maintenance plus gasoline for drivers).\n-\nPublic support (or tolerable opposition and interference).\nThe financing issue is different from the economic issue. Financing provides the cash necessary to construct, operate,\nand maintain a project. The ability of a project to be financed depends upon the availability of money - not upon the\nactual economic benefits of the projects. Economic issues concern the costs and benefits associated with a project,\n\nthe distribution of those costs and benefits, and whether the benefits are sufficient to justify the costs. Economic\nbenefits may include creation of jobs, congestion relief, reduction in accidents, or improved productivity for those\naffected by the project. Some of these benefits may be easily described in monetary terms, and some may be very\ndifficult to quantify in monetary or any other terms. They are economic benefits because they allow more efficient\nand more effective use of resources, even if the benefits do not translate directly into cash for the project or for\ninvestors.\nIt may be helpful for a project to have economic benefits in order to attract public or private financing. For example,\ngovernments may choose to subsidize transit operations, housing for low income or elderly residents, or agriculture.\nThe cash provided by those subsidies can in fact attract investors, who will create commuter rail services, apartment\nbuildings, and more productive farms. Whether or not these projects are really worth the subsidies that they receive\nis important for legislative bodies and elected officials to consider, but not necessarily something that will concern\ninvestors.\nGovernment approval will be needed for any almost any project. A building permit will be needed for constructing a\nscreen house in your back yard or for constructing a 100-story office building. Governments may establish regulations\nconcerning land use, protection of the environment, the siting and size of buildings, construction materials and\nmethods, the use of union or local labor, and many other factors that may affect the feasibility, cost, and ultimate\nsuccess or failure of the project. Whether or not government agencies approve proposals or provide the necessary\npermits may depend upon legislation, regulations, the whim of administrators, and/or feedback from the public. Large\nprojects tend to generate large criticism, so developers must always be concerned with public perceptions of their\nprojects and they must be aware of ways to make their projects more attractive to the public.\nPeople with the necessary skills are needed in designing projects, in constructing them, and in ensuring they continue\nto function. It is one thing to build a road. It is another thing to enforce weight limits to ensure that overloaded trucks\ndo not destroy the pavement within a few years, to enforce speed limits so as to promote safe driving conditions, and\nto establish periodic inspections, maintenance, and rehabilitation to keep the road in safe condition.\nProjects and the people who use them or depend upon them will need resources for operations and maintenance over\nwhat may be a very long lifetime. Projects may fail because the resources needed to sustain them become too costly\nor unavailable. Some of the most pressing issues of the 21st century relate to the continued availability of fossil fuels\nfor transportation, electrical power generation and home heating, and the availability of water for irrigation, household\nconsumption, and industrial use. Many projects and infrastructure choices were justified based upon usually unstated\nassumptions that unlimited supplies of cheap oil and water would always be available. Fossil fuels, however, will not\nlast forever, and prices will rise as reserves of oil, coal and natural gas are used up. With cheap oil, automobiles and\nairlines prosper; with expensive oil, transit and rail transportation become more competitive. With abundant water\nsupplies, crops can be grown in irrigated deserts, people can compete for the greenest lawns, and industries can use\nprocesses that consume vast amounts of water. Eventually, however, as population growth and other demands for\nwater increase, the supply of water is no longer sufficient for all the possible uses, so the use of water will be regulated\nand the price of water will rise. Moreover, water supplies may diminish. Regions that are heavily dependent upon\nwell water may find that their aquifers are drying up. In other regions, changes in climate may diminish the amounts\nof water that is available. Since drainage and river basins follow geographical rather than political boundaries, rival\ndemands for the use of water have and will continue to spark political battles between neighboring states and countries.\nA populous region, such as the Los Angeles metropolitan area, will seek to divert water from distant regions in order\nto support their needs, while perhaps limiting the growth and productivity of the regions from which the water is\ndiverted. Disputes over oil reserves have already sparked conflicts in the Middle East, and the potential for future\nconflict will continue as long as so much of the world's transportation, power generation, and industrial production is\nfueled by oil.\nPublic support, or at least tolerable opposition, is the final factor necessary for the long-term success of a project. The\npublic normally does not have a direct role in decisions regarding major projects, as most decisions regarding projects\nare made by elected officials, appointed officials and legislative bodies. However, the public can provide input into\n\nthe decision process, whether by participating in a process established to promote public involvement, by writing to\nnewspapers or elected officials, or by organizing groups to support or oppose projects. Public opposition can prevent\nparticular projects, it can lead to new regulations or legislation, and it can change programs and policy. In the late\n1960s and early 1970s, public opposition was the major factor in halting construction of major urban portions of the\nInterstate Highway System, including the so-called Inner Belt and the Southwest Expressway in Boston and the\nEmbarcadero in San Francisco. Public concerns over the safety of nuclear power plants had led to stringent regulation\nof the construction of such plants in the US by the 1970s; public outrage after a rather minor leakage incident at the\nThree-Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant effectively halted construction of such plants in the U.S. for decades.\nInfrastructure, Cities, and Civilization\nIt can be argued that infrastructure projects are the key to urbanization, which is perhaps the chief characteristic of\ncivilization. If people are to be able to congregate in cities, then they will need access to large amounts of clean water,\nand they will need to have some system for treating or isolating wastes. They will need to import food, building\nmaterials, and energy resources. They will need facilities and materials to support various kinds of manufacturing\nand trade. They will want to create facilities for education, sports and worship, for communications and entertainment.\nIn short, people will have to construct the infrastructure necessary to support all of the normal functioning of a densely\npopulated society.\nYour imagination, your initiative, and your indignation will determine whether we build a society where\nprogress is the servant of our needs or a society where old values and new visions are buried under\nunbridled growth. For, in your time, we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society\nand the powerful society but toward the Great Society. The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty\nfor all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, ... It is a place where the city of man serves\nnot only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger\nfor community. ...\nOur society will never be great until our cities are great. ...\nLyndon B. Johnson, President of the United States,\nexcerpts from the \"Great Society Speech\" delivered at the University of Michigan, May 22, 1964\nThe benefits of urbanization can be great for people's lifestyles and for efficient use of resources. Higher populations\ncan support a diversity of lifestyles and greater opportunities for jobs and recreations. There can be a greater frequency\nof and higher quality for social events. When people no longer have to spend all of their time eking out a living,\nwhether on a farm or in isolated rural areas, they will have sufficient time to enjoy the fruits of civilization. From a\nsystems standpoint, having large numbers of people living in a small area allows more efficient use of resources in\nconstructing and operating transportation networks, creating housing, supplying water and treating waste. As\nactivities are differentiated, complementary activities can be concentrated within special districts of the city. When\npeople are concentrated in well-situated cities with sound infrastructure, they can be protected from natural disasters,\nand it is possible to manage development so as to reduce the consequences of manmade disasters.\nOf course, as Freud pointed out in his book Civilization and Its Discontents, crowding vast numbers of people into\ncities may not be good for everyone. The more we protect ourselves from natural disasters and the more contact that\nwe are forced to have with each other, the more difficult it may be for us to live together. There is not only the loss\nof self-sufficiency that may be achievable on a farm, but there is also the possibility of extreme poverty. A city is\ndependent upon its infrastructure - and transportation or water resource systems may fail. If diseases break out,\nthousands may die, and pollution and the inability to absorb wastes may become continuous drains on health and\nhappiness. As cities grow ever larger, congestion is likely to limit mobility, and it may become ever more difficult to\nlimit pollution, to provide open space and to ensure adequate housing for everyone.\n\nWhether cities evolve into safe, livable, aesthetically pleasing places or degenerate into overcrowded dens of despair\ndepends to a very great extent upon the ability of the people of those cities to undertake the projects that will enable\nthem to meet the needs of human life and challenges of urban life. Anticipating and responding to challenges is the\ndriving force for successful civil and environmental projects. And there will always be new challenges.\nTomorrow's challenges may be quite different from yesterday's, but there will always be basic needs to be met and\nthere will always be a need for evaluating and choosing the best ways to meet those needs. Even with tremendous\nadvances in communications and computers, with automated factories and computer-controlled highway networks,\nwith cheap transportation for freight, a global economy, and ever-improving medical care, there will still be plenty to\ndo. After all, only about half of the world's population has access to clean running water; hundreds of thousands of\npeople die each year in transportation accidents; earthquakes and other natural disasters cause thousands of fatalities;\nbillions of people live in substandard housing; and nearly everyone who lives in a large city spends a large portion of\ntheir life stuck in traffic and breathing bad air.\nWhere Do Projects Come From?\nA project begins long before the groundbreaking, long before the first contract is signed, and long before a specific\nplan is identified and agreed upon by people with the resources and political power to make something happen. A\nproject begins with an idea, with a vision of what is wrong or what is needed or what is possible. Initial ideas quickly\nevolve into whole families of ideas and possibilities and soon different, competing options begin to emerge. Long\nbefore the time for computer analysis and project planning, strong-minded, imaginative, entrepreneurial, and political\nindividuals are vying to promote their concepts for the future. The players might include engineers, politicians,\ncharlatans, financiers, developers, or dreamers. There are no bounds to how they might think or talk about the project,\nor how they conceive the project fitting in to what is already in place or what could be put in place. Their creative\nprocesses can be slow or rapid, rational or chaotic, cooperative or acrimonious - there are no rules and there are no\nlimits to how hard people will push.\nThis undisciplined, often unmannerly process eventually leads to a specific project that will be constructed to finely\ndrawn plans with a well-defined scheme for paying for it all.\nAt this point, and not before this point, project\nmanagement skills are needed, and there will be plenty of work for those with specialized software, algorithms, and\nrisk management techniques that can lead to more efficient designs and timely completion of the project. But those\nskills are not much use in the early stages of project design and evaluation.\nIt is these early stages where there is the greatest uncertainty, the most excitement, the widest opportunities for\negregious errors, and the best chances for achieving elegance in a project. It is difficult to teach how to conduct this\nprocess for which there are no rules and few guideposts. By the time that the processes are well-enough defined to\ncreate guidebooks for planners, the damage of poorly conceived projects will be only too apparent. We built highways\nstraight through cities for decades before stopping to think seriously about the effects on the neighborhoods and the\npossibility for justifying less disruptive, more effective approaches. We need to think before we leap, we need to\nappreciate the creative, political, and entrepreneurial efforts that are needed, and we need to avoid the pitfalls that can\ncatch the unwary.\nA Framework for Project Evaluation\nProject evaluation can be broadly conceived to include five phases that cover the entire life-cycle of a project:\n1. Project identification\n2. Analysis of alternatives\n3. Assessing and comparing alternatives\n4. Implementation\n5. On-going evaluation\n\nThe first three phases may require many iterations before a final project is approved, and the final phase should\ncontinue over the entire life of a project.\nProject Identification. The first phase is the least well-defined and yet the most important for the ultimate success\nof a project or a program. Many ideas for projects arise in response to perceived problems and the needs of society.\nCongestion leads to ideas for new roads or new transit systems. Rising populations require new schools, housing, and\ndrinking water. If problems and needs are understood, and if there is a process for examining possible ways to deal\nwith them, then it should be possible to develop effective projects and programs that result in a better society.\nHowever, there will not necessarily be any process for determining and responding to societal needs. The ideas for\nmany projects may originate when someone senses an opportunity to make some money or to create some sort of\nmonument. Ideas for projects might well come from someone - an entrepreneur, a company or a public official - who\nspots an opportunity for using a new technology, for developing a particular plot of land or for expanding an existing\nnetwork of facilities.\nIt may well happen that project proponents first identify the project and then address the\nproblems or needs that would be addressed by this project.\nNevertheless, it is useful to have a framework in which the first step examines problems or needs. For an\ninfrastructure-based system, problems are likely to relate to cost, capacity, service quality, or safety. A problem may\nexist if some aspect of performance is believed to restrict the efficiency or effectiveness of the system. System\noperators will likely be aware of ways to improve performance, based upon their own insight into operations or based\nupon comparisons with similar systems in other locations. A need for better performance may be evident from user\ncomplaints, media reports, or scientific studies. Needs may be expressed in terms that are much different than the\nterms used to define problems. For example, transportation needs might be expressed in terms of mobility and\naccessibility, whereas transportation problems might be expressed in terms of travel delays and maintenance costs.\nThe objectives of the project need to be clear and well defined, but they can be modified based upon feedback and\nassessments concerning completed projects or new information related to needs and opportunities. The need for\nflexibility may lead to certain challenges in the overall decision-making and implementation process. Sometimes\nstrategic objectives are too narrowly defined and remain fixed despite changing conditions and acquisition of new\ninformation. Sometimes objectives are in conflict with objectives of other programs, particularly in the public sector,\nso that projects can only be developed after due consideration of related programs.\nThe next step is to generate alternatives for addressing the problems and needs that have been identified. Problems\nand needs should be considered in general terms, so that different kinds of alternatives can be considered. For example,\nmany systems must deal with potential capacity problems related to growth in population. If so, then alternatives\ncould not only consider expanding capacity to keep pace with population growth, but also consider increasing prices\nin order to limit demand or increasing efficiency of operations in order to allow more effective use of existing capacity.\nThe project identification phase concludes with a clear statement of needs, a set of objectives and specific assessment\ncriteria, and an initial list of alternatives for achieving the objectives. Key results from this stage of project evaluation\ninclude clear statements of needs and objectives, the establishment of criteria, and the selection of alternatives for\nfurther study.\nAnalysis of Alternatives. The process then enters the analysis phase, in which studies provide information that will\nhelp in assessing and comparing the various alternatives that are being evaluated. Various studies will be necessary\nto assess the viability of each alternative with respect to technical, financial, operational, social, economic,\nenvironmental or other objectives. Considerable discussion and thought will be devoted to identifying performance\nmeasures and evaluation criteria for each major objective. Preliminary studies may give an early indication of the\nviability of an alternative, along with the risk involved. The most promising alternatives will be studied in greater\ndepth. Analysis may include market demand studies, cost-benefit analysis, environmental impact assessment, and\nsocial assessment. Very detailed analyses involving multiple groups of people with backgrounds in engineering,\neconomics, environmental science or other disciplines may be required. Important planning decisions during this\n\nphase of project evaluation include the allocation of resources to the different types of studies and the extent to which\nthe process allows refinement and modification of alternatives.\nAssessing and Comparing Alternatives. Assessing the results of the analysis is a separate stage from analysis,\nbecause there will be many different kinds of results to be considered. During this phase, it will be necessary to\ncompare alternatives with respect to how well they satisfy the objectives that were previously established. Assessment\nwill involve consideration of financial, economic, environmental and social factors. To what extent does each\nalternative meet the needs that are being addressed? What are the costs and benefits of each alternative? Are costs\nand benefits measured properly? To what extent does each alternative lead to positive or negative externalities, i.e. to\nbroader impacts on the environment or the community or the region that would result from implementing a particular\nalternative?\nWhereas analysis requires specialists and may include many independent studies, assessment requires generalists. For\npublic projects and for large private projects that require public approval, there will have to be opportunities for input\nfrom potential users, abutters, and the general public. Users may push for a bigger and better system. Abutters, those\nwho live next to the construction sites, may like the concept of the project, but oppose the proposed location. This\ntype of opposition is so common that it is known by an acronym - NIMBY - which means \"Not In My Back Yard.\"\nThe general public, to the extent that is informed about the issues, is likely to be more receptive to a more balanced\napproach that recognizes the potential benefits of the project while acknowledging the importance of externalities.\nThe goal at this stage is not necessarily to define the exact, best option, but to determine the general approach that is\nbest. The outcome from this stage could be one of three broad conclusions:\n-\nOne alternative clearly is the best.\n-\nFurther study is necessary to determine which alternative is best.\n-\nNone of the alternatives is worth pursuing.\nIf one alternative is clearly the best, then it is possible to proceed to the next phase. If there is no alternative that is\nclearly the best, then more detailed analysis may be needed that focus on what are believed to be the most promising\nalternatives. It may also be desirable to revise some of the alternatives or to suggest new alternatives or different kinds\nof analysis. This phase of the evaluation process requires the consideration of multiple objectives as well as risk\nassessment in order to compare what could be markedly different alternatives. It also requires some mechanism for\nensuring that there are no better alternatives that should have been studied, as well as a mechanism for determining\nthat the preferred alternative in fact is a cost-effective way of meeting the needs identified at the outset. Table 1\nsuggests some guidelines for this phase of project evaluation.\nImplementation. Project identification, analysis and assessment are iterative processes that may continue for years\nor decades without finding an alternative that is technically, financially, and politically feasible. Eventually, it may\nbe possible to agree upon a particular alternative. The fine-tuning of a particular alternative may involve mitigation\nof environmental or social impacts, it may involve modifications aimed at reducing costs or increasing benefits (a\nprocess known as value-engineering), and it may involve modifications to incorporate recommendations resulting\nfrom public input or the various studies that were conducted. At some point, detailed engineering design can be\ncompleted, and a construction management program can be initiated. A strategy for construction must be developed.\nHow soon should construction begin? How quickly should construction proceed? What are the possibilities for\nimplementing the project in stages? Once these questions have been answered, a project management team will be in\ncharge of the actual construction process, and there will be innumerable decisions related to the best construction\ntechniques, logistics, coordination of sub-contractors, communications and cooperation with relevant public\nauthorities and maintaining the safety and security of the site. Before construction is complete, it will be necessary to\nbegin the transition from to operation. Eventually the construction phase ends and the project is up and operating: the\nbridge is open, the tenants are in the building, the water is flowing, or the park is opened to the public.\n\nTable 1 Guidelines for Assessing Projects\n1.\nAddress the grand issues.\n-\nEconomic viability - is there a clear case for supporting the\nproject?\n-\nEngineering - what are the options regarding capacity, staging, and\nflexibility?\n-\nFinancial feasibility - is there a way to cover investment and\noperating costs?\n-\nEnvironmental impacts - can the project be done with less negative\nimpact on the environment? Can it result in improvements to the\nenvironment?\n-\nPolitical feasibility - who is likely to support or oppose the project?\nHow can negative social impacts be mitigated?\n-\nOrganizational structure - is the project best done as a public\nproject, a private project, or a public/private partnership?\n-\nSize - would a larger or smaller project be better than what is\nproposed?\n2.\nConsider comparable projects to get a quick, though rough estimate of the\nviability of the project.\n3.\nConsider the possibility that the benefits are so great that there is more\ndanger from doing too little than from doing too much.\n4.\nBe prepared to think at all scales: local, regional and national.\n5.\nThink about aesthetics and plan with an eye to style.\nOn-going Evaluation. Few projects are so well-planned and so carefully executed that everything goes perfectly on\nday one of the transition. There will be a period of time during which minor problems will be identified and corrected.\nAfter operations have settled down, it will be possible to compare the actual performance to what was intended. Was\nthe project completed as planned? Was it completed on time and on budget? Most importantly, how effectively has\nthe project addressed the original problems and needs? Answers to questions such as these will help in planning the\nnext project and perhaps help in creating criteria for a program for constructing many similar projects.\nIn summary, the process of defining a project can be viewed as a logical sequence of well-defined steps beginning\nwith identification of needs and concluding with on-going monitoring of performance. While it is useful to have a\nframework such as this for thinking about projects and project evaluation, it is important to recognize two fundamental\naspects of the process of defining and selecting projects.\nFirst, the process is iterative. It may begin either with identifying needs, technological opportunities, or with an idea\nfor a specific project. Once assessment begins, new ideas may emerge or people may find serious problems with all\nof the proposals, so it will be necessary to reconsider the needs and the opportunities.\nSecond, the process may not necessarily be logical or rational. Suggestions for projects may come from those who\nwant to build them or from those who want to operate them - whether or not the projects they propose are the best\nprojects or the projects that respond to the most pressing needs of society. Companies that build roads and bridges\nwant to build more roads and bridges, just as highway authorities may respond to all transportation problems by\nrecommending construction of more highways. New technologies quickly lead to ideas for new projects, but it may\nbe years or decades or longer before those projects can be justified. With many new technologies, the new capabilities\ncreate new needs, or at least perceived needs (continuous, instantaneous connections to the internet; high definition\nTV). With advertising, suppliers can create needs that drive construction of new plants and distribution facilities\n(bottled water is a good example - especially when the water is obtained directly from a region's public water supply).\nIt is a mistake to expect the process to be completely rational. On the other hand, it is also a mistake not to try to\n\nimpose a rational process on defining needs, identifying alternatives, and assessing, selecting, and modifying\nalternatives.\nEssays and Case Studies\nThis book includes a collection of essays and cases studies that address the many phases of project evaluation. The\nfirst volume provides a framework for understanding and evaluating projects, taking into account not only the financial\nand economic issues, but also social and environmental factors. Examples and case studies illustrate the complexity\nof major projects and demonstrate the role for and the limits of analysis in clarifying and resolving issues. The second\nvolume shows how to apply the basic methods of engineering economics in evaluating major infrastructure projects.\nExamples and exercises indicate how to develop and apply models for estimating the costs of resources required for\nsuch projects and how to estimate their life-cycle costs. A major goal of both volumes is to promote an approach to\nproject evaluation that is based upon an appreciation of the needs of society, the potential for sustainable development,\nand a recognition of the problems that may result from poorly conceived or poorly implemented projects and programs.\nKey concepts include the following:\n-\nJustification of large investments: how to determine whether future benefits justify current costs.\n-\nTechnology-based performance functions: creating functions with sufficient detail to explore how cost,\nservice, capacity, and safety vary with major project options related to size, design, and technology.\n-\nCost-effectiveness: how to compare options for achieving non-monetary benefits.\n-\nSustainability: environmental, financial, economic and social aspects of sustainability.\n-\nEvolution of systems: understanding how systems evolve in response to changes in needs, technologies,\nand financial capabilities.\nAnalytical methodologies can be applied to each of these concepts. However, it is critical to recognize that analysis\nwill not necessarily determine what projects are considered, what projects are proposed, which of these projects are\napproved or which projects are ultimately successful.\nProjects may be motivated by a vision of a greater society, by an idea for addressing a specific local problem, by the\nprospects of making a profit while providing a needed service, or by simple greed. Some apparently excellent projects\ncannot be financed, while it may be easy to fund some very questionable projects. Lackluster projects may prevent\noutstanding projects, and highly acclaimed projects may prevent dozens of less showy, but more effective projects.\nFinancially successful projects may be terrible in terms of their consequences for the environment, and projects sold\nas being good for the environment may turn out to be overly expensive or socially unacceptable.\nProject evaluation is not a hard science, as there are so many factors to consider, so many unknowns, and so many\ndifferent perspectives concerning what is good or bad. Nevertheless, there is a role for analysis, if only to help people\nto recognize and agree upon the likely magnitude of the most important costs and benefits. Past experience, a coherent\nframework for analysis, and a concern for sustainability will provide a sound basis for evaluating projects, whether\nyou are the developer, the consultant, the banker, the neighbor, the user, or the politician.\nThis text is published in two volumes. The first volume provides an overview of project evaluation as a multi\ndimensional process aimed at creating projects that meet the needs of society. This volume emphasizes the need to\nconsider economic, environmental and social factors along with the technological and financial matters that are crucial\nto the success of a project. It concludes with a chapter that considers the evolution of infrastructure-based systems and\nthe need for more sustainable infrastructure in the coming decades.\nThe second volume provides in-depth coverage of the engineering economic methodologies that can be used to\ncompare cash flows or economic costs and benefits over the life of a project. That volume presents the techniques\nthat are used by investors, bankers, and entrepreneurs in deciding whether or not to finance projects. It also shows\n\nhow public policy can use taxes and other regulations to encourage projects that have public benefits. Both volumes\npresent methodologies that are useful in developing and evaluating projects to deal with problems and opportunities.\nAs noted in the preface, the essays and case studies are all structured as stand-alone documents, so it is possible to\npick and choose which ones to read, and it is possible to read them in any order.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Project Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies\nCarl D.

      "content": "Project Evaluation: Essays & Case Studies\nPreface\nMotivation\nThis book contains essays and case studies that are based upon materials that I prepared for \"Project Evaluation\",\nwhich I designed and taught for more than ten years as one of the required subjects in MIT's Department of Civil &\nEnvironmental Engineering. The subject was designed to fill a void in the education of civil engineering students,\nnamely an understanding of why major infrastructure projects are undertaken, how they are structured and evaluated,\nand how they are financed. These topics, which naturally are of central importance to civil and environmental\nengineering, are related to, but certainly not central to micro-economics, the subject that was previously required for\ncivil engineering undergrads at MIT.\nMicro-economics is an interesting and challenging field, but it tends to ignore or brush quickly over some of the central\nissues in designing and developing infrastructure projects. Where should a project be located? When should it be\nbuilt? Can it be developed in phases, so that capacity can be added only when and where it is needed? For engineers,\nplanners, and entrepreneurs, these are critical questions. Those who want to be engineers, planners or entrepreneurs\nmust learn how to balance current vs. future costs and benefits, and they must be able to understand and respond to\nthe many factors that influence the pace and location of development. In particular, they must understand the time\nvalue of money, the equivalence of cash flows, and the effects of risk and inflation on discount rates and the\nattractiveness of projects. These are all central topics in engineering economics, but they are largely or entirely absent\nfrom the standard introduction to micro-economics. As I tell my students, economics is a bit too close to the Twilight\nZone - \"a dimension neither of space nor time\".\nA second concern with micro-economics is that many of the most interesting concepts are extremely difficult to apply\nwithout making assumptions that, to an engineer or planner or entrepreneur, seem to be simplistic or heroic or merely\nuntenable. An engineer is likely to treat with suspicion any proposition that begins with \"given a cost function\" or\n\"given a production function\" or \"given supply and demand curves\". Where do these functions come from? How are\nthese curves calibrated? Some economists have gone to factories and rail yards and studied the inputs and outputs\nactually required for the various possible means of production. More commonly, economists have relied on statistical\ntechniques to calibrate functions that certainly appear to be very complex to the student (or to the reader of a journal\narticle), but that in fact are a quite simple portrayal of costs or production or demand based upon analysis of what has\nhappened in the past. For many purposes, notably many kinds of policy analysis, econometric modeling and economic\ntheory provide useful insights, but when considering major projects, engineers, planners, and entrepreneurs are more\nconcerned with what can be done in the future than with what was done in the past. New technologies, new designs,\nchanges in relative costs of inputs, and many other factors will influence what will be possible or desirable to do in\nthe future. Someone, presumably the engineers and the planners, will have to figure out what can be done and convince\nothers that it should be done, tasks that require creativity and judgment as well as an understanding of complex systems\nand methodologies.\nWhile I understand the argument that undergraduates should learn the basics of their field and that they should\ndiscipline their mind through thorough rigorous examination and understanding of a complex, intellectually\nstimulating subject, my personal experience suggests that students require the stimulation of real situations to truly\nunderstand the concepts that we try to teach them. Moreover, it is possible to over-emphasize methodologies and\ntheories while doing little to encourage independent thought and initiative. Thus, in designing my class on project\nevaluation, I included case studies, open-ended problem sets, and a term project in which the students investigated\nxi\n\nprojects of their own choosing. I had students complete some exercises from an engineering economics textbook, but\nI was much more interested in how well they could apply the methodologies and ideas in analyses and interpretations\nof realistic problems.\nAt this point I should add a short note on my background. As an undergrad I studied math, but lost interest as the\ntheory deepened and the potential applications receded. As a senior and then in graduate school, I shifted to studying\nwhat was just beginning to be called \"urban systems\", but eventually ended up writing a thesis on rail freight system\nreliability. For the next 35 years, I remained on the research staff at MIT, supervising many research projects that\nwere funded by the rail freight industry - an experience that forced me and my students to pay great attention to detail\nand to reality. In effect, we spent several decades working with rail researchers and field personnel to understand and\nimprove the cost functions and production functions related to various categories of rail freight. Over this period, the\nrail industry transformed itself from a nearly bankrupt, over-built and under-maintained system into a thriving, stream\nlined system with more trains, longer and heavier trains, heavier loads, and more efficient equipment and facilities.\nThe industry had little to spend on research, so it went to great efforts to focus that research on areas where there\nwould be a payoff. Participating in this research proved to be an outstanding way to understand the functioning of an\nextremely complex, long-lived system as it was updating its infrastructure and equipment to serve new markets.\nDuring my research career, I described much of what I did as being some sort of engineering economics. Several\naspects of engineering economics were absolutely critical:\n-\nNet present value and equivalence of cash flows: the ability to compare cash flows over long time horizons\nfor multiple alternatives, often in an attempt to understand the potential for new technologies or operating\nstrategies.\n-\nEngineering-based cost and performance functions: the ability to structure detailed cost and performance\nfunctions that captured the relevant aspects of the technologies and operations that were of interest.\n-\nProbabilistic analysis: the ability to include probabilistic features when structuring cost and service functions.\n-\nIdentification of key factors: the use of financial analysis, scenarios, and sensitivity analysis to identify the\nmost important factors affecting a project, the use of new technology, or the choice of operating or marketing\nstrategies.\n-\nApproximation: appreciation of the fact that it is seldom necessary to obtain precise results in order to reach\nsolid conclusions.\n-\nStructuring and interpreting results:\nrecognizing that lack of consensus regarding objectives, ambiguity\nrelated to costs and constraints, uncertainty about how systems really work, and many other factors make it\nunwise to accept the totally unwarranted level of precision that can be obtained from modern computational\ntechnologies.\nMy class on project evaluation was, like Caesar's Gaul, divided into main three parts. The first part provided an\noverview of project evaluation as a multi-dimensional process aimed at creating projects that meet the needs of society.\nThe second part covered discounting, net present value, financial assessment, and other basic methodologies of\nengineering economics. The third part addressed issues such as risk and uncertainty, technology scanning, public-\nprivate partnerships, and the evolution of infrastructure systems over long periods of time.\nOver time, the basic framework remained unchanged, but I was able to develop ever more detailed notes, additional\nassignments, more open-ended case studies, and more complete presentations for my undergraduate class on project\nevaluation. I also gave lectures on project evaluation in graduate courses at MIT in the Department Civil &\nEnvironmental Engineering, the Center for Transportation & Logistics, and the Engineering Systems Division. After\nretiring from my full-time appointment at MIT, I began to transform my lecture notes and other course materials into\na series of essays and case studies suitable for a textbook. At the request of Jenny Welter, an editor at John Wiley &\nSons, I expanded my notes by adding a great many simple examples, hundreds of problems, and new material on\nproject management and engineering economics. In 2011, Wiley published Toward More Sustainable Infrastructure:\nProject Evaluation for Planners and Engineers, a 500-page textbook that covers the basic methods of project\nevaluation, provides examples attuned to infrastructure systems, and includes case studies that illustrate the breadth\nxii\n\nand excitement of project evaluation as related to infrastructure systems. Solutions to the problems, an instructor's\nmanual, and power point presentations for each chapter are all available from Wiley. These materials can provide\nstudents and instructors with tools and concepts that they can use in understanding or teaching the need for projects,\nthe options that are available, and the methods for evaluating and refining the options that are available.\nHowever, a 500-page textbook is not the ideal format for presenting the concepts of project evaluation to a broader\naudience that includes grad students interested in infrastructure systems, mid-career engineers making the transition\nto management, public officials involved with infrastructure systems or anyone else with an interest in planning for,\nmanagement of, or investment in infrastructure systems. I therefore decided to return to my class notes and\nprofessional papers in order to create a shorter, more focused book that would be readily available to anyone interested\nin infrastructure systems. Instead of a textbook with long chapters and hundreds of examples and problems, this book\nfocuses on concepts and case studies directly related to project evaluation. It assumes the reader is familiar with\nsupply & demand and other basic economic concepts; it does not cover project management; and it avoids going into\nesoteric elements of engineering economics such as equivalence relationships involving gradients or geometric\nsequences. Nevertheless, most of material in this book is very similar to what is in the textbook, because both books\ndraw upon the same notes, case studies, technical papers, and presentations that I developed while teaching my class\non project evaluation between 1997 and 2009.\nThe material includes two categories of documents, namely essays and case studies. Those who wish to gain a broad\nconceptual framework for understanding project evaluation in the context of infrastructure systems can read the essays;\nthose who wish more detail on methodologies in the context of specific projects can concentrate on the case studies.\nEach essay and each case study is a stand-alone document that be read without being distracted by references to\ndefinitions or methods developed in prior or subsequent chapters. Project Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies\nshould therefore be useful to practitioners and anyone with a general interest in project evaluation or infrastructure,\neven though it may be less appealing to a professor hoping to find a multitude of simple examples and a great many\nproblems for his students to solve.\nAlthough this book does not include sample problems and problem sets, such materials can be found under \"1.011\nProject Evaluation\" as part of MIT's Open Courseware website at www.MIT.edu or directly from:\nhttp://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/75001/1-011-spring-2005/contents/index.htm?sequence=5\nThis web site provides the syllabus, reading lists, assignments, quizzes and other class materials for several different\nversions of the class. It also includes student presentations for a half dozen major projects, each of which would be\ninteresting to a general reader of this book. The URL shown above is for the 2005 version of \"Project Evaluation\",\nwhich is the most complete version on Open Courseware for the years when I alone was responsible for this subject.\nStructure of Project Evaluation Essays and Case Studies\nProject Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies is published in two stand-along volumes. The first volume provides an\noverview of project evaluation as a multi-dimensional process aimed at creating projects that meet the needs of society.\nThe essays and case studies in this volume provide a framework for understanding and evaluating projects, taking into\naccount not only the financial and economic issues, but also social and environmental factors. The essays in this\nvolume emphasize that analysis will not necessarily determine what projects are considered, what projects are\nproposed, what projects are approved or what projects are ultimately successful. Projects may be motivated by a\nvision of a greater society, by an idea for addressing a specific local problem, by the prospects of making a profit\nwhile providing a needed service, or by simple greed. Some apparently excellent projects cannot be financed, while\nit may be easy to fund some very questionable projects. Case studies in Volume I are mostly based upon actual\ninfrastructure projects.\nVolume II examines the equivalence relationships that can be used to compare cash flows or economic costs and\nbenefits over the life of a project. It covers the concepts and methodologies that can be used by investors, bankers,\nxiii\n\nand entrepreneurs in deciding whether or not to finance projects, and it shows how public policy can use taxes and\nother regulations to encourage projects that have public benefits. Most of the case studies in Volume II present\nhypothetical situations that illustrate how various methodologies can be used in project evaluation.\nCarl D.

      "content": "Project Evaluation:\nA Few Final Thoughts\n\"Civil engineers are problem solvers, but we need to broaden the scope of our services to\ninclude problem definition. Civil engineers must go beyond thinking in terms of project specific\nlimits and scopes of work and become involved in system-wide, program-related decisions and\npolicy-making to achieve long-term, sustainable solutions.\nWe must be facilitators of\ncollaboration among multiple agencies/owners and across jurisdictional boundaries. We must\nalso take a leadership role in developing acceptable and sustainable methods of funding\ninfrastructure development and asset management.\"\nKathy J. Caldwell, ASCE News, June 2009\nSocieties and civilizations advance through projects that seek to make life safer, healthier, more prosperous or more\nsecure. History abounds with tales of famous projects, from the pyramids of Egypt and Mexico, the temples of Greece\nand Cambodia, the aqueducts and roads of Rome and the Great Wall of China to the canals, railroads and telegraphs\nof the 19th century and the highways, telecommunication, dams, and water and wastewater systems of the 20th.\nCountries have been bankrupted by bad projects, secured by practical projects, and advanced by bold projects.\nIndividual fortunes have been made or squandered on projects, as banks and financial markets have made it possible\nto direct vast sums of money toward massive undertakings anywhere in the world. Large projects entail large risks,\nand such projects will only be undertaken if those promoting the projects can convince investors or governments to\nfund them. Highly capable, charismatic individuals motivated many great projects, including the Suez Canal, the\nBrooklyn Bridge, and the Empire State Building. However, it has not always been possible to separate the true\nvisionaries from the charlatans and the deluded, especially when it comes to large outlays of public funds.\nProject evaluation could be viewed narrowly as a set of procedures and methodologies that can be used to determine\nwhether or not a proposal should be approved. Indeed, there are well-defined methods for assessing financial aspects\nof a project, and private companies and investors use these methods routinely in determining whether or not to begin\nprojects or to invest in them. Moreover, governments today mandate environmental and social impact assessment\nprior to the approval of any significant project, and they use intricate economic models to estimate the effect of public\ninfrastructure investments.\nHowever, taking such a narrow approach misses the most interesting and challenging aspects of projects and programs,\nnamely coming up with ideas for what could become a successful project. Someone has to come up with the proposals\nthat will be subjected to careful scrutiny by banks, government agencies, and the public. Such proposals could emerge\nfrom a careful consideration of what society needs, they could reflect insight into opportunities offered by new\ntechnologies, or they could simply be pipe dreams that appeal to public emotions but that have little chance of success.\nMuch of the challenge and excitement in project evaluation deals with the earliest stages of a project, in clarifying the\nneeds of society, in anticipating technological opportunities, and pulling together ideas or objectives for a possible\nproject or program. Figuring out what the problem really is, defining the problem in a way that invites diverse\nsolutions, and responding to the problems effectively and creatively can be extremely rewarding, both in terms of the\nsuccess of whatever is done and in terms of the intellectual satisfaction of those involved in the process. In these early\nstages of project evaluation, breadth of thinking, curiosity, imagination, intuition and flexibility are more important\nthan analytical capabilities or methodological excellence. This is when the story of a project begins to emerge.\nEvery project has a story, and every story has several components. What are the context and the history of the project?\nWhat are the needs that are addressed by the project? How will the proposed project meet those needs? What other\napproaches are available and why is the proposed approach the best approach? How much will it cost and who will\npay for it? What are the broader impacts on society? What is the proper role for government? Why should the public\nsupport the project? How will negative externalities be mitigated? Projects will have financial, economic, social,\n\nenvironmental and aesthetic impacts, any or all of which could be important in telling the story, in evaluating whether\nor not to proceed or how best to proceed, and in going from preliminary thoughts toward final design.\n\"The need is to subordinate economic to aesthetic goals - to sacrifice efficiency, including the\nefficiency of organizations, to beauty. Nor must there be any nonsense about beauty paying in the\nlong run. It need not pay. It is though the state that the society must assert the superior claims of\naesthetic over economic goals and particularly of environment over cost.\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith, \"Liberty, Happiness and the Economy\",\nThe Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 149, No. 5, June 1967, pp. 521-26\nGood solutions seldom come straight from a textbook, nor do they come from the use of complex techniques of\noperations research that claim to find the optimal solution to a problem. Good solutions arise from a deep\nunderstanding of the nature of the problems or needs and a clear idea of what might be done. Experts who have\ndeveloped a comprehensive conceptual framework for addressing system performance will often be able to contribute\na great deal to the early stages of project evaluation, especially with regard to the kinds of technical approaches that\nare possible. Users, abutters, and members of the public will be able to contribute their understanding of needs,\nidentify issues that are important, and - in the aggregate if not always individually - help in applying some common\nsense to the discussion. Brainstorming, systematic analysis, sensitivity analysis, and scenarios can all be useful in\neliciting ideas and in determining what approaches might work best in dealing with a problem.\nThe gestation period for very large projects may be measured in decades, and gaining approval for a major project or\nprogram may require seemingly endless political wrangling and nearly impossible coordination among local, state,\nand federal officials. Projects and programs therefore will need champions who are willing and able to fight the\nbureaucratic, political and legal battles that must be waged. The most effective leaders will incorporate social and\nenvironmental elements into the initial design and be able to use the environmental impact assessment process as a\nmeans of enhancing projects and building public support for them.\nVery few infrastructure projects relate to anything that is entirely new. Most proposed projects will be viewed as\npotential enhancements to an existing system that deals with transportation, water resources, energy, or some other\nsocietal need. Effective project evaluation therefore requires understanding of how such systems are created, how\nthey evolve to meet changing social and economic conditions, and how they eventually give way to obsolescence or\nto new technologies. Different types of projects and different kinds of issues are encountered in each stage of system\nevolution. In early stages, there will be a struggle to determine how best to use new technologies, how to structure\nfacilities or networks, and in general how to become more effective and more efficient. In later stages, there will be\na need to adjust the size and structure of the systems to adjust to new technologies or new kinds of competition. At\nthe end, the challenge may be to grow old gracefully and pass away.\nIn recent decades, changes in technology have made some of our infrastructure systems obsolete, changes in social\nnorms have made other systems inadequate, and changes in scientific knowledge have revealed unacceptable results\nfrom the systems we have built and continue to use. As result, most infrastructure systems initiated long ago are\nproving to be unsustainable, because of financial, social or environmental problems. We have become ever more\naware of the need to grapple with climate change, over-dependence upon fossil fuels, destruction of forests and\nwetlands, contamination of the oceans, congestion and pollution within our largest cities, and ensuring adequate food\nand clean water for the growing global population. To deal with these issues, we will need to manage our infrastructure\nsystems more effectively, develop new technologies, and initiate projects that enhance the sustainability of our\ncivilization. Sustainable projects and programs will be those that will have adequate financing for construction,\nmaintenance, and operations, a fair distribution of costs and benefits to society, and the ability to continue indefinitely\nwithout significant depletion of resources or disruption of the environment. Engineers, planners, conservation groups,\nbusinesses, politicians, and the general public will have to work together to figure out how best to move toward more\nsustainable infrastructure for the 21st century and beyond.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Project Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies\nCarl D.

      "content": "Introduction\nThe first half of this book consists of six essays that describe a variety of methods and procedures that can be useful\nwhen evaluating potential infrastructure projects. The second half includes eleven hypothetical case studies that\nillustrate how these methods and procedures might be used. Each essay and each case study can be read as a stand\nalone document, as there are no cross-references within them, nor is it necessary to read any essay before reading any\ncase study. Someone familiar with the methodology may prefer to read about applications in their areas of interest.\nSomeone with experience in particular kinds of applications may prefer to gain broader exposure to the methods\ndescribed in the essays.\nSystem Performance, the first essay introduces various measures that can be used to assess the performance of\ninfrastructure projects and to evaluate alternatives for improving performance. Inevitably, there will be many aspects\nof performance to consider and many possible impacts on society or the environment that must be minimized or\nmitigated. Financial analysis, which is concerned with the cash flows directly related to a project, will be critical, but\nso will economic analysis, which also includes the impacts of a project on the overall economy. Both financial and\neconomic impacts can be measured in monetary terms; which types of impacts are considered will depend upon who\nis doing the analysis. Owners, developers and users will largely be interested in financial matters; public agencies\nthat must approve projects are concerned with broader economic matters, such as job creation and regional prosperity.\nThe next four essays are concerned with engineering economics, which provides many of the methodologies that are\nneeded for financial and economic analysis, including the effects of taxes and depreciation, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nA central tenet of engineering economics is that it is possible to use a discount rate to estimate the equivalent present\nvalue of any future value. Given a discount rate, it is possible to calculate the net present value (NPV) of any stream\nof financial or economic costs and benefits that might be associated with a project.\nEquivalence of Cash Flows develops the basic relationships that can be used to transform an arbitrary stream of\nfinancial or economic benefits into an equivalent present value, an equivalent value at some future time, or an\nequivalent annuity. These relationships are what makes it possible to compare the financial and economic impacts of\nmultiple alternatives. The alternative with the highest net present value will also have the highest future value and\nproduce the largest equivalent annuity. Thus, from a financial or economic perspective, it makes sense to choose the\nalternative that maximizes net present value.\nThe equivalence relationships all depend upon the choice of a discount rate, which is far from a simple, objective task.\nChoosing a Discount Rate goes into considerable detail discussing the factors that will affect the choice of a discount\nrate, emphasizing that different actors involved in implementing, using, or investing in a project may have different\nperceptions of the project and therefore may use different discount rates when evaluating a proposal.\nOnce the NPV of financial or economic benefits have been calculated, it is straightforward to select the alternative\nwith the highest positive NPV. However, complications may arise if a different measure is used. Companies\ncommonly use the internal rate of return when evaluating projects. The IRR is the discount rate that makes the NPV\nequal zero. If the IRR is greater than a company's discount rate, then that is a valid project. However, if there are\nmutually exclusive projects, then a small project with a high IRR might appear to be better than a larger project with\na lower IRR that actually has a higher NPV. Financial Assessment presents methods that show how to deal with this\nissue. So long as the IRR analysis is applied properly, it will provide the correct ranking of mutually exclusive\nprojects.\n\nFigure 1: Structure of Four Essays Related to Discounting and Cash Flows\nNPV of Net\nBenefits\nProjected Before-Tax\nCash Flows\nDiscount Rate\nProjected After-Tax\nCash Flows\nTax Code\nCost of Capital\nPerceived Risks\nEquivalent Future\nBenefits\nEquivalent\nAnnuities\nSelect the project with the highest\nNPV, FV, and Annuity Value\nChapter 10\nChapter 8\nChapter 9\nChapter 7\n\nEssay:\nRules of the Game\nEssay:\nChoosing a Discount Rate\nEssay:\nFinancial Assessment\nEssay: Equivalence of\nCash Flows\nPublic policy can affect the cash flows of a project in many ways. Zoning restrictions may limit what can and cannot\nbe done on a site. Regulations may determine what kinds of materials or construction techniques can be used. The\nintricacies of the tax code can be manipulated by law-makers in order to promote or hinder certain types of\ndevelopment or certain types of investments. In particular, major investment expenses usually cannot be immediately\ndeducted from taxable income; instead capital investments are depreciated over many years. Exactly how depreciation\nis treated in the tax code will determine when this expense is incurred. Since expenses affect profits, and profits result\nin income tax payments, it is necessary to consider depreciation in order to obtain a valid after-tax analysis of a project.\nRules of the Game shows how depreciation, taxation, zoning, and environmental regulation can evaluation.\nDealing with Risks and Uncertainties introduces methods that are commonly used in project evaluation to deal with\nrisks and uncertainties: modeling performance, probabilistic risk assessment, and performance-based technology\nassessment (PBTS). One case study uses probabilistic risk assessment to examine ways to reduce the risks associated\nwith rail-highway grade crossings. Another case study uses PBTS to examine competition between airlines and\nrailways for intercity passenger traffic.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Project Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies\nCarl D.

      "content": "Project Evaluation: Essays & Case Studies\nVolume II\nPreface\nMotivation\nThis book contains essays and case studies that are based upon materials that I prepared for \"Project Evaluation\",\nwhich I designed and taught for more than ten years as one of the required subjects in MIT's Department of Civil &\nEnvironmental Engineering. The subject was designed to fill a void in the education of civil engineering students,\nnamely an understanding of why major infrastructure projects are undertaken, how they are structured and evaluated,\nand how they are financed. These topics, which naturally are of central importance to civil and environmental\nengineering, are related to, but certainly not central to micro-economics, the subject that was previously required for\ncivil engineering undergrads at MIT.\nMicro-economics is an interesting and challenging field, but it tends to ignore or brush quickly over some of the central\nissues in designing and developing infrastructure projects. Where should a project be located? When should it be\nbuilt? Can it be developed in phases, so that capacity can be added only when and where it is needed? For engineers,\nplanners, and entrepreneurs, these are critical questions. Those who want to be engineers, planners or entrepreneurs\nmust learn how to balance current vs. future costs and benefits, and they must be able to understand and respond to\nthe many factors that influence the pace and location of development. In particular, they must understand the time\nvalue of money, the equivalence of cash flows, and the effects of risk and inflation on discount rates and the\nattractiveness of projects. These are all central topics in engineering economics, but they are largely or entirely absent\nfrom the standard introduction to micro-economics. As I tell my students, economics is a bit too close to the Twilight\nZone - \"a dimension neither of space nor time\".\nA second concern with micro-economics is that many of the most interesting concepts are extremely difficult to apply\nwithout making assumptions that, to an engineer or planner or entrepreneur, seem to be simplistic or heroic or merely\nuntenable. An engineer is likely to treat with suspicion any proposition that begins with \"given a cost function\" or\n\"given a production function\" or \"given supply and demand curves\". Where do these functions come from? How are\nthese curves calibrated? Some economists have gone to factories and rail yards and studied the inputs and outputs\nactually required for the various possible means of production. More commonly, economists have relied on statistical\ntechniques to calibrate functions that certainly appear to be very complex to the student (or to the reader of a journal\narticle), but that in fact are a quite simple portrayal of costs or production or demand based upon analysis of what has\nhappened in the past. For many purposes, notably many kinds of policy analysis, econometric modeling and economic\ntheory provide useful insights, but when considering major projects, engineers, planners, and entrepreneurs are more\nconcerned with what can be done in the future than with what was done in the past. New technologies, new designs,\nchanges in relative costs of inputs, and many other factors will influence what will be possible or desirable to do in\nthe future. Someone, presumably the engineers and the planners, will have to figure out what can be done and convince\nothers that it should be done, tasks that require creativity and judgment as well as an understanding of complex systems\nand methodologies.\nWhile I understand the argument that undergraduates should learn the basics of their field and that they should\ndiscipline their mind through thorough rigorous examination and understanding of a complex, intellectually\nstimulating subject, my personal experience suggests that students require the stimulation of real situations to truly\nxi\n\nunderstand the concepts that we try to teach them. Moreover, it is possible to over-emphasize methodologies and\ntheories while doing little to encourage independent thought and initiative. Thus, in designing my class on project\nevaluation, I included case studies, open-ended problem sets, and a term project in which the students investigated\nprojects of their own choosing. I had students complete some exercises from an engineering economics textbook, but\nI was much more interested in how well they could apply the methodologies and ideas in analyses and interpretations\nof realistic problems.\nAt this point I should add a short note on my background. As an undergrad I studied math, but lost interest as the\ntheory deepened and the potential applications receded. As a senior and then in graduate school, I shifted to studying\nwhat was just beginning to be called \"urban systems\", but eventually ended up writing a thesis on rail freight system\nreliability. For the next 35 years, I remained on the research staff at MIT, supervising many research projects that\nwere funded by the rail freight industry - an experience that forced me and my students to pay great attention to detail\nand to reality. In effect, we spent several decades working with rail researchers and field personnel to understand and\nimprove the cost functions and production functions related to various categories of rail freight. Over this period, the\nrail industry transformed itself from a nearly bankrupt, over-built and under-maintained system into a thriving, stream\nlined system with more trains, longer and heavier trains, heavier loads, and more efficient equipment and facilities.\nThe industry had little to spend on research, so it went to great efforts to focus that research on areas where there\nwould be a payoff. Participating in this research proved to be an outstanding way to understand the functioning of an\nextremely complex, long-lived system as it was updating its infrastructure and equipment to serve new markets.\nDuring my research career, I described much of what I did as being some sort of engineering economics. Several\naspects of engineering economics were absolutely critical:\n-\nNet present value and equivalence of cash flows: the ability to compare cash flows over long time horizons\nfor multiple alternatives, often in an attempt to understand the potential for new technologies or operating\nstrategies.\n-\nEngineering-based cost and performance functions: the ability to structure detailed cost and performance\nfunctions that captured the relevant aspects of the technologies and operations that were of interest.\n-\nProbabilistic analysis: the ability to include probabilistic features when structuring cost and service functions.\n-\nIdentification of key factors: the use of financial analysis, scenarios, and sensitivity analysis to identify the\nmost important factors affecting a project, the use of new technology, or the choice of operating or marketing\nstrategies.\n-\nApproximation: appreciation of the fact that it is seldom necessary to obtain precise results in order to reach\nsolid conclusions.\n-\nStructuring and interpreting results:\nrecognizing that lack of consensus regarding objectives, ambiguity\nrelated to costs and constraints, uncertainty about how systems really work, and many other factors make it\nunwise to accept the totally unwarranted level of precision that can be obtained from modern computational\ntechnologies.\nMy class on project evaluation was, like Caesar's Gaul, divided into main three parts. The first part provided an\noverview of project evaluation as a multi-dimensional process aimed at creating projects that meet the needs of society.\nThe second part covered discounting, net present value, financial assessment, and other basic methodologies of\nengineering economics. The third part addressed issues such as risk and uncertainty, technology scanning, public-\nprivate partnerships, and the evolution of infrastructure systems over long periods of time.\nOver time, the basic framework remained unchanged, but I was able to develop ever more detailed notes, additional\nassignments, more open-ended case studies, and more complete presentations for my undergraduate class on project\nevaluation. I also gave lectures on project evaluation in graduate courses at MIT in the Department Civil &\nEnvironmental Engineering, the Center for Transportation & Logistics, and the Engineering Systems Division. After\nretiring from my full-time appointment at MIT, I began to transform my lecture notes and other course materials into\na series of essays and case studies suitable for a textbook. At the request of Jenny Welter, an editor at John Wiley &\nSons, I expanded my notes by adding a great many simple examples, hundreds of problems, and new material on\nxii\n\nproject management and engineering economics. In 2011, Wiley published Toward More Sustainable Infrastructure:\nProject Evaluation for Planners and Engineers, a 500-page textbook that covers the basic methods of project\nevaluation, provides examples attuned to infrastructure systems, and includes case studies that illustrate the breadth\nand excitement of project evaluation as related to infrastructure systems. Solutions to the problems, an instructor's\nmanual, and power point presentations for each chapter are all available from Wiley. These materials can provide\nstudents and instructors with tools and concepts that they can use in understanding or teaching the need for projects,\nthe options that are available, and the methods for evaluating and refining the options that are available.\nHowever, a 500-page textbook is not the ideal format for presenting the concepts of project evaluation to a broader\naudience that includes grad students interested in infrastructure systems, mid-career engineers making the transition\nto management, public officials involved with infrastructure systems or anyone else with an interest in planning for,\nmanagement of, or investment in infrastructure systems. I therefore decided to return to my class notes and\nprofessional papers in order to create a shorter, more focused book that would be readily available to anyone interested\nin infrastructure systems. Instead of a textbook with long chapters and hundreds of examples and problems, this book\nfocuses on concepts and case studies directly related to project evaluation. It assumes the reader is familiar with\nsupply & demand and other basic economic concepts; it does not cover project management; and it avoids going into\nesoteric elements of engineering economics such as equivalence relationships involving gradients or geometric\nsequences. Nevertheless, most of material in this book is very similar to what is in the textbook, because both books\ndraw upon the same notes, case studies, technical papers, and presentations that I developed while teaching my class\non project evaluation between 1997 and 2009.\nThe material includes two categories of documents, namely essays and case studies. Those who wish to gain a broad\nconceptual framework for understanding project evaluation in the context of infrastructure systems can read the essays;\nthose who wish more detail on methodologies in the context of specific projects can concentrate on the case studies.\nEach essay and each case study is a stand-alone document that be read without being distracted by references to\ndefinitions or methods developed in prior or subsequent chapters. Project Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies\nshould therefore be useful to practitioners and anyone with a general interest in project evaluation or infrastructure,\neven though it may be less appealing to a professor hoping to find a multitude of simple examples and a great many\nproblems for his students to solve.\nAlthough this book does not include sample problems and problem sets, such materials can be found under \"1.011\nProject Evaluation\" as part of MIT's Open Courseware website at www.MIT.edu or directly from:\nhttp://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/75001/1-011-spring-2005/contents/index.htm?sequence=5\nThis web site provides the syllabus, reading lists, assignments, quizzes and other class materials for several different\nversions of the class. It also includes student presentations for a half dozen major projects, each of which would be\ninteresting to a general reader of this book. The URL shown above is for the 2005 version of \"Project Evaluation\",\nwhich is the most complete version on Open Courseware for the years when I alone was responsible for this subject.\nStructure of Project Evaluation Essays and Case Studies\nProject Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies is published in two stand-along volumes. The first volume provides an\noverview of project evaluation as a multi-dimensional process aimed at creating projects that meet the needs of society.\nThe essays and case studies in this volume provide a framework for understanding and evaluating projects, taking into\naccount not only the financial and economic issues, but also social and environmental factors. The essays in this\nvolume emphasize that analysis will not necessarily determine what projects are considered, what projects are\nproposed, what projects are approved or what projects are ultimately successful. Projects may be motivated by a\nvision of a greater society, by an idea for addressing a specific local problem, by the prospects of making a profit\nwhile providing a needed service, or by simple greed. Some apparently excellent projects cannot be financed, while\nit may be easy to fund some very questionable projects. Case studies in Volume I are mostly based upon actual\ninfrastructure projects.\nxiii\n\nVolume II examines the equivalence relationships that can be used to compare cash flows or economic costs and\nbenefits over the life of a project. It covers the concepts and methodologies that can be used by investors, bankers,\nand entrepreneurs in deciding whether or not to finance projects, and it shows how public policy can use taxes and\nother regulations to encourage projects that have public benefits. Most of the case studies in this volume present\nhypothetical situations that illustrate how various methodologies can be used in project evaluation.\nCarl D.

      "content": "1.011 Project Evaluation\nCarl D. Martland\nAssignment 2\n\"Developing Cost and Revenue Functions\"\nCanals were among the first major civil engineering projects in the United States. In the era before railroad or\ntruck transportation, land transportation was cumbersome, slow, and expensive. Water transportation - when\navailable - was much cheaper, more reliable, and provided the only means of handling large volumes of freight,\nwhich of course was why cites grew up at the best harbors and along the major navigable rivers. The first\ncanals simply bypassed rapids so as to avoid costly transshipment of goods. Later canals, such as the Middlesex\nCanal, linked major cities to their hinterlands. More ambitious projects, such as the Potowmack and Erie Canals\nsought to open up western regions and thereby promote development (not to mention the importance of the port\ncity whose citizens promoted the project).\nThe width and depth of a canal and the size of the locks determine the size of the boats that can use the canal.\nThe deeper and wider the canal, the more material that must be excavated and the more expensive the project.\nThe larger the locks, the more expensive they become and the more water that is required to operate the system.\nHence, there are fundamental design issues concerning the size of the canal and the type of boats that will be\naccommodated.\nSome of the early canals could only handle small boats with a capacity on the order of 15 tons; these boats\nrequired a draft of only 12 inches when loaded. Larger canals could handle larger boats, e.g. boats that could\ncarry 75 tons along canals providing more than 4 feet of draft. The channel - at the bottom of the canal - must\nbe wide enough for two boats to pass (or there must at least be periodic basins where opposing boats can pass).\n1. Capacity Model (30%)\nThe capacity of a canal (maximum throughput measured in tons of cargo) could be estimated for various time\nperiods, e.g. a peak day with 12 hours of operation; a peak summer month with 12 hours operation, 7 days/week;\nfor a year, with operations ceasing during the winter and during major storms. Boats can tie up for the night at\neither end of the canal or at frequent locations along the length of the canal; as a result, boats will likely be\ndispersed all along the canal at the beginning and end of the day.\na. Develop a spreadsheet model of a canal's capacity as a function of the characteristics of the canal, the\nboats, and the operating characteristics (e.g. speed through the canal, cycle time of the locks [i.e. the\ntime required for one boat to pass through the lock], hours available for operation per day and week,\nand months available for operation per year).\nb. Use this model to estimate the capacity (tons/month) of a canal that is 30-miles long, has 10 locks (1\nlock at each of 10 locations), is wide enough for 2 boats to pass assuming that it is designed for a) 15\nton, b) 25-ton, or c) 75-ton boats.\nc. What are the most important factors affecting the capacity of the canal?\n2. Operating Cost Model (30%)\nCanals competed with horse-drawn wagons:\n\"The advantages of canal travel over wagon transport were obvious at once. One horse, for example,\ncould easily draw 25 tons of coal on the canal. On land the same horse could pull only 1 ton. One\nteam of oxen could pull 100 tons, an amount that would take eighty teams on land. In the first eight\nmonths of the canal's operation, 9,405 tons were carried at a cost of $13,371. The cost for such a\n\nshipment by land would have been $53,484.\" Daniel L. Schodek, \"Landmarks in American Civil\nEngineering\", MIT Press, p. 12\nThese estimates of operating cost for this 27-mile canal can easily be converted to the cost/ton or the cost/ton\nmile of transporting freight by canal boat or by wagon.\nWe would like to estimate the benefits (cost savings) from constructing a canal that would attract traffic from\nwagons. Assume that the cost/ton-mile for wagon transport is constant. Assume that the operating costs for a\ncanal are based upon typical values for the early 19th century:\n-\nCost for the 2-person boat crew ($1/day each, for 10 working hours)\n-\nCost for the teamster and the horse ($1/day each or $2/day total)\n-\nCost for the boat ($2/day for 15-ton; $2.50 for 25-ton; $5/day for 75/ton boats)\n-\nCost for lock operations ($2/day for an operator and routine maintenance)\n-\nCost for canal and embankment maintenance ($40/year per mile)\n-\nAverage speed (3 miles per hour along the tow path)\n-\nAverage time per lock (12 minutes for small, 15 for medium, and 20 for large boats)\na. Develop a spreadsheet model for estimating the cost per ton and cost per ton-mile of moving freight\nalong a canal similar to the Middlesex canal. The traffic volume (tons/year), length of the canal, the\nnumber of locks, hours of operation per day, days of operation per week, and months available for\noperation should all be variables in your model.\nb. Use your model to estimate the operating cost for each of the 3 sizes of boats assuming that annual\ntraffic varies from 10,000 to 100,000 tons per year.\nc. What are the most important factors affecting the operating cost of the canal?\n[NOTE: question 2 requires you to estimate the fixed and variable costs of operations; to get the total cost per\nton at a particular level of traffic, you must allocate the fixed cost to the tonnage that is handled.]\n3. What Size Boats? (40%)\nAssume that the state legislature (which has allowed you to build the 30-mile canal) has authorized you to\ncharge no more than 50% of the wagon costs per ton-mile, no matter what size boat you use. Further assume\nthat you can raise money for investment that equals 10 times the annual operating profits (i.e. if projected\noperating profits were $10,000 per year, you could raise $100,000 to construct the canal). The Middlesex Canal\ncost $528,000, which is just under $20,000 per mile. To keep the calculations simple, assume that the per-mile\nconstruction costs would be $20,000, $25,000, and $30,000 to handle the three sizes of boats (thus operating\nprofits would have to be at least $2,000, $2,500, and $3,000 per mile respectively before the investors would\nbe willing to provide enough funds to construct the canal). How much annual tonnage would be needed to\njustify building a canal that handled a) 15-, b) 25- or c) 75-ton boats?\n[NOTE: you can approach this problem as a breakeven analysis. The contribution per ton (i.e. revenue per ton\n- variable cost per ton) multiplied by total tonnage must be sufficient to cover the fixed operating costs of the\ncanal and leave enough operating profit to justify the investment.]\n4. What Role for Analysis? (Bonus - 10%)\nDescribe how analysis related to one of the following disciplines could be used to make meaningful\nimprovements to your model of the performance of the canal: fluid mechanics; materials science; structural\nmechanics; soil mechanics; physics; probability & statistics; biology.\n\nThoughts on Spreadsheet Design\n1. Title: have a title for the spreadsheet and for each exhibit\n2. Appearance: set up the spreadsheet so that you can print exhibits for your term project\n3. Control panel: have a section where it is easy to enter key variables and see key results\n4. Tables: a table that shows results for various sets of inputs can be very useful to have\n5. Level of detail: you do not have to be any more detailed than \"Skyscraper\"; if you do not\nhave the data that you would like, then you should estimate what seem to be reasonable\nnumbers for costs and benefits (be sure to explain which numbers are estimates and why you\nbelieve these estimates are reasonable; if you have good numbers, be sure to show the\nsource) - this assignment is concerned with your ability to design a spreadsheet and you will\nbe able to get better inputs as you progress with your term projects\n6. Graphs: it is often helpful to create one or more graphs to display cost, benefits, comparisons\nof options, or sensitivity analysis\n7. Interpretation of Results: it may be useful to introduce cost effectiveness measures for some\nprojects (e.g. $/resident, or $/transit trip, or some other measure that puts the numbers into\ncontext)\n8. Color, borders, etc: this can make your results sparkle - but don't spend a lot of time on this\nand don't let the style overwhelm the substance\n9. Text: remember, you can write descriptive paragraphs in the spreadsheet\n10. Detailed calculations vs. results: you may want to move the details to a part of the\nspreadsheet that you don't have to print or view; make some portions of your work\naccessible in tables and charts that are easily viewed and printed.\n11. Level of precision: remember that your analysis involves many different estimates, some of\nwhich are bound to be rather imprecise. When you show results, be sure not to use too many\nsignificant figures. Spreadsheets allow you to specify the number of decimal places, and\nthey also allow you to round off the numbers that are displayed. You can also show results\nin, say, $ million or even $ billion and thereby avoiding having to show too many significant\ndigits.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Project Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies\nCarl D.

Martland\nAssignment 3\nEquivalence of Cash Flows\nCreate a Spreadsheet for Equivalence Analysis (20%)\nCreate a spreadsheet that you can use to estimate equivalent cash flows for arbitrary sequences of\ncash flows over 50 periods. You want to be able to use this spreadsheet to convert any sequence\nof cash flows into a present worth, a future worth at any time t, or an annuity over N periods. You\nwant to be able to do this using both discrete and continuous compounding factors, and you want\nto be able to compute effective interest rates. Take some care in designing your spreadsheet so\nyou can easily do sensitivity analysis on interest rates and N, and so you can easily print out a\ncompact and attractive report showing results to questions such as those shown below. Figures 3\n27, 3-28, and 3-29 suggest how to incorporate the various discrete and continuous compounding\nfactors and how to calculate effective interest rates.\nSpreadsheet Applications (10% each)\n1. Salvage value: you are involved with a project that is expected to last 50 years and have a\nsalvage value of $10 million. A consultant has advised your company that an\nexpenditure of only $100,000 at the end of every 5 years will double the salvage value.\nYour company generally uses an MARR of 15% - do you buy the consultant's\nrecommendation?\n2. Bonds: A bond has an initial purchase price of $1,000 and an interest rate of 6% paid at\nthe end of each year for 30 years. At the end of the 30th year, you also receive the initial\npayment of $1,000. You buy the bond, and after a few years, interest rates change. As\na result, the market value of the bond will change - even though the planned 6% interest\nwill still be paid on the bond and the principal payment will still be returned at the end of\n30 years. In general, as interest rates go up, the value of the bond declines, and vice\nversa. To appreciate this, calculate the following:\na. What is the value of the bond at the beginning of year 6 to someone with a\nMARR of 7%? At the beginning of year 29?\nb. What is the value of the bond at the beginning of year 6 to someone with a\nMARR of 5%? At the beginning of year 29?\nFinancing a Major Project (all remaining questions are 10% except that Question 7\ncounts for 20%):\nYou are considering whether or not to bid on a project involving the construction of a toll\nbridge. The city is prepared to provide the land that is required, and the contractor will be able\nto charge tolls for the life of the project. The contractor will own and operate the bridge for a\n\nperiod of at least 20 and at most 50 years. At the end of the project life, the bridge and its tolls\nwill be turned over to the city. Your bid must specify the initial toll, the allowable increases\nin tolls, and the life of the project.\n3. What is the PW of the construction costs as of the beginning of month 1, assuming that you\nwill use company funds to construct the bridge, your MARR is 15%, and the major costs\nwill be as follows:\na. $24 million for engineering design work (months 1-24)\nb. $100 million for construction of the bridge (months 25- 72)\nc. $10 million for construction of the toll plaza (months 60-72)\n4. The traffic volume on the bridge is expected to be average 40,000 vehicles per day for the\nfirst year when the bridge is open. This estimate assumes a toll of $2 per vehicle. If tolls\nare constant, traffic growth for the bridge is expected to be 2% per year for the indefinite\nfuture. What is the PW at time 0 of the toll revenues that you expect to collect if you\noperate the bridge for a 20, 30, 40 or 50 year period?\n5. If a different toll is charged, traffic volumes will also change. An increase of 25% in the\ntoll to $2.50 is expected to result in a 10% decline in traffic; likewise, a decrease of 25%\nin the toll to $1.50 per vehicle is expected to lead to a 10% increase in traffic. If tolls are\nchanged in the future, then traffic volumes are expected to change as well (in economic\nterms, this means that the elasticity of volume with respect to price is expected to be about\n-.4; this means that an X% change in price is expected to lead to a -0.4X% change in\ntraffic). What is the PW at time 0 of the toll revenues that you expect to collect over a 50\nyear operating period assuming that you charge a toll of $1.50? of $2.50?\n6. The contribution to overhead and profit (i.e. the difference between annual toll revenues\nand annual expenses) is an important financial measure. This is your profit if you finance\nthe bridge yourself, and it is the amount you have available to pay off the loans if you\nborrow money. You will be responsible for maintaining the bridge and paying for toll\noperations. Bridge maintenance costs are expected to be $2 million per year for routine\nmaintenance plus an additional $10 million for rehabilitation in year 15, 30 and 45. Toll\ncosts are primarily related to the toll collectors; costs are expected to be $0.5 million per\nyear. If the toll is $2, what is your expected annual contribution to overhead and profit?\n7. Structure your bid for building, operating, and transferring this bridge. Specify the initial\ntoll, your strategy for raising tolls, and the time you intend to operate the bridge (20, 25,\n30, 40, or 50 years). Explain why you think this is the best approach.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Project Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies\nCarl D.

      "content": "1.011 Assignment 4\n\"Time is Money: Financing a Skyscraper\"\nThis assignment requires you to understand thoroughly the differences between interest rates and\ndiscount rates, the differences in risks as a project progresses from concept through\nimplementation, and the differences in perspective of entrepreneurs, owners, and investors. This\nassignment should be viewed as the \"ruling grade\" of this class on project evaluation: to complete\nthis assignment satisfactorily, you have an excellent grasp of the concepts and applications of\nequivalence and clear insight into the financial mechanisms underlying a large infrastructure\nproject.\nFinancing a Skyscraper\nA simple cost model for the construction of a skyscraper could be based upon the following:\na. The land area (acres) and the price of the land ($0.1 to $10 million/acre)\nb. The costs of clearing the land ($10 to $50,000/acre)\nc. The foundation ($2-4 million/acre)\nd. The weight-bearing structure\ne. The exterior of the building, including windows, exterior materials, waterproofing, and\ninsulation\nf. The elevators\ng. Heating, air-conditioning, ventilation\nh. Creation of a dramatic entry area and mini-parks\ni. Interior walls\nj. Interior finishing\nFor a CEE project, we are generally considering whether or not to begin a particular type of project.\nWe probably have several basic design and location options plus numerous minor variations on\nthese options, e.g. variations in size or quality of components. From the underlying logic of the\nproject, we can develop a function that relates the project costs to the design and location\npossibilities. Separate functions can be used to estimate the initial investment costs as well as the\nfixed and variable operating costs. As engineers, it is our job to try to understand what options are\navailable, including new designs or construction techniques as well as \"tried & true\" approaches.\n\nRevenues\nWe also would like to estimate the demand for the services provided by our project, taking into\naccount the quality of the service provided, the capacity of our project and competing facilities,\nand the price that we and our competitors charge. For a skyscraper, the revenues will be based\nupon the rental rates, commonly expressed as the annual rent per square foot. A skyscraper makes\nfinancial sense if the projected rents (net of any continuing expenses) will be sufficient to justify\na mortgage sufficiently large to cover all of the costs of construction, including interest on a\nconstruction loan.\nTiming and Cost Assumptions\nFor this assignment, let's just consider the example described by Karl Sabbagh in \"Skyscraper\", as\nsummarized in the attached note. This is a great book describing the people and the processes\ninvolved in constructing a 50-story office building plus some smaller buildings in Manhattan. As\nis the case with most engineering books, the focus is on the technical rather than the financial\nmatters. Hence, in addition to the information presented in the note (which is about all there is in\nthe book), we need to make some additional assumptions to evaluate various options for the\nproject:\na. The time between land acquisition and beginning of construction is exactly 18 months. All\nof the engineering and architectural work is completed during this period.\nb. The time from groundbreaking until the time that tenants can move in is exactly 24 months\n(i.e. months 19 to 42 of the project if the project is completed on time).\nc. The permanent mortgage is obtained 3 months after the tenants move in (at the end of\nmonth 45 if the project is completed on time).\nd. The tenants have 4 months (to fix up the interior) before they make their first rent payment\n(at the end of month 46 if the project is completed on time).\ne. The fixed costs include the land acquisition, preparation of the case for development, the\narchitects' and engineers' fees (assumed to be $90 million of the $145 million for fees and\nborrowing costs cited in the note), $45million of the construction costs (for the foundation,\nlandscaping, entry, lobby and the roof), and $5 million of the project management costs.\nf. The $90 million architect/engineering fees are paid uniformly over the first 18 months of\nthe project; the $145 million construction costs are paid uniformly over the period of\nconstruction.\ng. The construction could be stretched out over 3 years with a savings in construction of $5\nmillion and essentially no chance of an overrun.\nh. The project costs are covered by a construction loan with interest of 10% per year charged\nfrom the point that costs were incurred. (This type of loan works like a checkbook - the\n\nowner writes checks for all payments, and the amount of the check is added to the\noutstanding amount of the loan. Interest is charged and added to the outstanding balance\nat the end of each month.)\ni. When the project is completed, the construction loan can be refinanced at a rate of 8%.)\nj. All invoice and loan payments are made on the last day of the month.\nk. Additional space, if available, could likely be rented at $30/sq. ft. per year or more.\nQuestions\n1. Project Cost (30 points) - Construct a spreadsheet that can be used to calculate the costs of\nconstruction, including interest costs on the construction loan. Structure the spreadsheet so that it\nshows the various cost categories across the top and the months (1 to 48 down the side). Have\ncolumns for total monthly cost in each of the various cost categories, a column for the total and\nanother column for the cumulative costs as of the end of the month. With this information, you\ncan calculate the monthly interest charged on the cumulative costs at the end of each month\n(remember to use the monthly, not the annual rate of interest!). You can also calculate the PW of\nthe total project costs (use discreet discounting compounded monthly). Have an area at the top of\nthe spreadsheet where you can enter key parameters (including interest rate on the construction\nloan, length of the construction period, and the owner's discount rate) when doing sensitivity\nanalysis. Use the spreadsheet to answer the following questions:\na. Estimate the total project cost as of the end of month 45 when - if all goes well - the permanent\nmortgage is secured. (The total cost is the sum of interest cost plus construction cost, which will\nequal the total amount of the construction loan as of the end of month 45. This amount should be\nroughly comparable to the $370 million shown in the note.)\nb. What is the present worth of the total project cost as of the beginning of month 1 assuming a\ndiscount rate of 15%?\nc. How would the total project cost (as calculated in part a) and the PW (as calculated in part b)\nvary if the:\n- Interest rate for the construction loan were 8% or 12% rather than 10%?\n- The time required for construction were 30 or 36 months rather than 24 months?\n- The owner's discount rate were 12% or 18%?\n2. Project Revenue (20 points) - Assume that the project has one major tenant who pays $26/sq.\nft. for 600,000 sq. ft. and another who pays $29/sq.ft for 200,000 sq. ft., while all other space is\nrented at $30/sq.ft. (these are annual rates per square foot for long-term leases)\na. Calculate the monthly revenue assuming that the building is fully leased from the outset\n\nb. Calculate the PW of the revenue as of the beginning of the first month in which rents are\nreceived (use the owner's discount rate of 15%)\nc. Calculate the PW of the revenue as of the beginning of month 1 (using the owner's discount\nrate of 15%)\nd. From the owner's perspective, is this a worthwhile project?\n3. Refinancing (10 points) - Once the building is up and rented, the owner can refinance the\nbuilding at a lower interest rate, because the bankers now can see the completed building and the\npaying tenants. Assume that the bank will provide a 30-year mortgage with the maximum amount\nno greater than the minimum of a) project cost or b) 80% of the net present value of the rents\n(calculated with a discount rate equal to the interest rate on the loan). What would the maximum\namount of the mortgage be and what would the monthly payments be?\n4. Selling the building (20 points) - Once the building is refinanced, the owners may get bored\nsimply collecting rents and making mortgage payments.\na.\n(5 points) What is the minimum sale price that they should accept assuming that their\ndiscount rate remains 15%?\nb. (5 points) Suppose they see great opportunities in South American gold mines where\nthey expect to make a 25% return - how low would they go?\nc. (10 points) What would you recommend as a reasonable sale price for the building?\nWhy? [Assume that the new owners will take over the mortgage, and be sure to include\nthe balance on the mortgage in the sale price!]\n5. Redesigning the building (20 points) - Suppose that, early in the planning stage, the city\nplanning department offers you a chance to increase the floor area ratio to 15 (which would allow\nyou to add 3 stories and 100,000 sq. ft. of rentable space). All you have to do is provide an\nenclosed, all-weather walkways to neighboring buildings as part of a \"downtown mall\" concept.\nAssume that it would take 2 months longer to construct the somewhat larger and more complex\nproject. How much additional cost would you be willing to pay to construct the all-weather\nwalkways in order to gain the benefits of the added rentable space? [Be careful to consider all of\nthe relevant costs and revenues.]\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\nResource: Project Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies\nCarl D.

      "content": "1.011 Project Evaluation\nTerm Project - Case Studies in Project Evaluation\nMotivation: project evaluation is not an exact science. While it is possible to apply standard techniques\nof engineering economics in assessing costs and benefits, most large-scale projects have significant costs\nand benefits that are either difficult to predict, difficult to convert to monetary terms, or highly controversial\nto at least some of the parties involved in or affected by the project. Furthermore, the process of project\nevaluation will generally be quite distinct from, although obviously dependent upon, the process of\nengineering design. Studying how benefits and costs of actual projects were debated and evaluated is an\nexcellent way to learn about the complexities of project evaluation.\nAssignment: prepare a case study of the evaluation process for a major CEE project.
