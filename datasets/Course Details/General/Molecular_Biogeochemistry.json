Hydrocarbons migrate upwards from the mantle whereby they provide carbon and\nenergy for a subsurface biosphere. These hydrocarbons derive their biological signatures from\nthe subsurface organisms that feed on them\nGold T. (2001) The Deep Hot Biosphere : The Myth of Fossil Fuels. Freeman Dyson.\n\"Rock oil originates as tiny bodies of animals buried in the sediments which, under the\ninfluence of increased temperature and pressure acting during an unimaginably long period of time\ntransform into rock oil\" -- M.V. Lomonosov 1757AD.\nOrganic matter that is preserved in sedimentary rocks is biological in origin and was buried with\nthose sediments. Petroleum and natural gas are formed and expelled from sediments when\nthis organic matter becomes deeply buried and heated\nTriebs A.

Technology has generally led to a\n1.85\ngreater use of hydrocarbon fuels for most\n2.0\nhuman activities, making civilization vulnerable\n2.9\n1.9\nto decreases in supply. At this time our\n1.8\nknowledge is not sufficient for us to choose\n1.85\nbetween the different estimates of, for example,\n2.0\nresources of conventional oil.\n1.0\n0.6\n0.6\n\nMost estimates of the quantity of conventional oil resources remaining\nThe best-known model of oil production was proposed by Marion\nKing Hubbert, who proposed that the discovery, and production, of\npetroleum over time would follow a single-peaked, symmetric bellshaped\ncurve with a peak in production when 50% of the URR had\nbeen extracted.\nThis hypothesis seems to have been based principally\non Hubbert's intuition, and it was not a bad guess as he famously predicted in\n1956 that US oil production would peak in 1970, which in fact it did.\nHubbert also predicted that the US production of natural gas would peak in\nabout 1980, which it did, although it has since shown a major recovery with\nproduction of 'shale gas' and 'tight gas'.\nHe also predicted that world oil production would peak in about 2000. There\nwas a slight downturn in world production in 2000, but production in the first\nhalf of 2003 is running slightly above the rate in 2000.\n\nThe future: other technologies\nThe world is not about to run out of hydrocarbons, and perhaps it is\nnot going to run out of oil from unconventional sources any time soon. What\nwill be difficult to obtain is cheap petroleum, because what is left is an\nenormous amount of low-grade hydrocarbons, which are likely to be much\nmore expensive financially, energetically, politically and especially\nenvironmentally. As conventional oil becomes less important, society has a\ngreat opportunity to make investments in a different source of energy, one\nfreeing us for the first time from our dependence on hydrocarbons.\nSubsidies and externalities, social as well as environmental, affect energy\nmarkets. With few exceptions, these subsidies and externalities tilt the playing\nfield towards conventional sources of energy.\nIt is time to think about possibilities other than the next cheapest\nhydrocarbons, if for no other reason than to protect our atmosphere, and\nfor this task we must use all of our science, both natural science and\nsocial science, more intelligently than we have done so far.\n\nKlemme, H. D. & Ulmishek, G. F. Effective petroleum source rocks of the world:\nstratigraphic distribution and controlling depositional factors. Bull. Am. Ass. Petrol.\nGeol. 75, 1809-1851 (1991).\nA review, with 201 refs., and survey of main global petroleum source rocks, in terms of\nstratigraphic distribution and controlling depositional factors for petroleum generation\nand trapping.\nSix stratigraphic intervals, corresponding to 1/3 of Phanarozoic time, contain >90% of\nthe world's original discoverable oil and gas reserves.\nThe maturation time of these source rocks demonstrated that ~70% of the discovered\noil and gas has been generated since the Coniacian, and ~50% of the world's\npetroleum has been generated and trapped since the Oligocene.\n\nThe Fate of OM: Diagenesis, Metagenesis\nOrganic matter from defunct organisms is almost quantitatively remineralized back to\ncarbon dioxide in most modern aquatic environments. However, a small fraction of\ntotal biomass, on average less than 0.1 % (Holser et al., 1988), escapes\nremineralization, and eventually accumulates in sediments.\nAs compounds with\nrapid biological turnover rates - including carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids\nare most prone to recycling, more resistant molecules such as lipids and recalcitrant\nstructural biopolymers become concentrated (Tegelaar et al., 1989).\nDuring\ntransport through the water column, and subsequently in the unconsolidated\nsediment, this organic matter is further altered by a variety of chemical and biological\nprocesses commonly referred to as diagenesis (e.g. Hedges and Keil, 1995; Hedges\net al., 1997; Rullkotter, 1999). During diagenesis a large fraction of the lipid and other\nlow-molecular-weight components react via condensation and sulfur-vulcanization\nand combine with degradation-resistant macromolecules to form kerogen (e.g. de\nLeeuw and Largeau, 1993; Derenne et al., 1991). Formally, kerogen is defined as\nthe fraction of large chemical aggregates in sedimentary organic matter that is\ninsoluble in solvents. In contrast, the fraction of organic matter that can be extracted\nfrom sediments with organic solvents such as dichloromethane and methanol, is\ndefined as bitumen (pyrobitumen and radiobitumen are residues of migrated\npetroleum that was cross linked and immobilized by heat and radioactivity,\nrespectively). Bitumen in Recent sediments is predominantly composed of\nfunctionalized lipids.\n\nThe Fate of OM: Diagenesis, Metagenesis\nDuring diagenesis, these lipids undergo oxidation, reduction, sulfurization, desulfurization\nand rearrangement reactions, generating an array of partly or entirely defunctionalized\nbreakdown products that can have different stereo- and structural isomers. Analysis of\nthese alteration products often yields valuable information about prevailing chemical\nconditions in the sediment during and after deposition because the extent and relative\nspeed of diagenetic reactions is dependent on environmental conditions such as redox\nstate, pH and availability of catalytic sites on mineral surfaces. Where reducing conditions\nprevail in the sediment biolipids eventually lose all functional groups but remain\nidentifiable as geologically stable hydrocarbon skeletons.\nDiagenetic reactions in the presence of reduced sulfur species have a profound effect on\nthe sedimentary fate of lipids and other biological debris (Sinninghe Damste and de\nLeeuw, 1990) and the preservation of diagnostic carbon skeltons (e.g. Adam et al., 1993;\nKenig et al., 1995; Kohnen et al., 1992; Kohnen et al., 1993; Kohnen et al., 1991a;\nKohnen et al., 1991b; Schaeffer et al., 1995; Wakeham et al., 1995) in complex, sulfur-rich\nmacromolecules. The subsequent release of these skeletons upon burial provides one of\nthe most important mechanisms for preserving the structural integrity of organism-specific\nbiomarkers.\n\nThe Fate of OM: Diagenesis, Metagenesis\nWith increasing burial over millions of years, geothermal heat will initiate catagenesis, the\nthermal degradation of kerogen and bitumen. Kerogen is cracked into smaller fragments,\nreleasing increasing volumes of bitumen that eventually might be expelled from its source\nrock as crude oil. Weaker chemical bonds, such as S-S and S-C, are cleaved at relatively\nlow temperatures with the result that sulfur-rich kerogens might commence oil generation\nat lower temperatures (e.g. Koopmans et al., 1997; Lewan, 1985). Hydrocarbon chains\nattached to kerogen via stronger C-O and C-C bonds are sequentially released at higher\ntemperatures. Also, with increasing heat flux, biomarkers and other components in the\nbitumen undergo thermal rearrangement and cracking reactions. By measuring the\nrelative abundances of these thermal products, it is possible to assess the maturity of an\noil or bitumen. With continuing burial, and at temperatures and pressures that initiate low-\ngrade metamorphism of the host rock, most or all of residual bitumen is expelled or\ncracked to gas and the kerogen becomes progressively depleted in hydrogen to form a\npartly crystalline, semi-graphitic carbon phase (metagenesis). The exact temperature and\ntime constraints of metagenesis and the preservation of hydrocarbon biomarkers are\nmuch debated (e.g. Mango, 1991; Price 1997).\n\nOrganic Facies\n'An organic facies is a mappable subdivision of a\nstratigraphic unit, distinguished from the adjacent\nsubdivisions on the character of its organic constituents,\nwithout regard to the inorganic aspects of the sediment'\nR.W.

Lewan\nNature 1998, 391 164\nMost petroleum is formed through the partial decomposition of kerogen\n(an insoluble sedimentary organic material) in response to thermal\nstress during subsurface burial in a sedimentary basin1,2. Knowing the\nmechanisms and kinetics of this process allows the determination of the\nextent and timing of petroleum formation, which, in turn, are critical for\nevaluating the potential for petroleum occurrences within a sedimentary\nbasin. Kinetic models of petroleum generation are derived mainly from\npyrolysis experiments1,2, in which it is usually assumed that formation\nrates are controlled by the strength of the bonds within the precursor\ncompounds: this agrees with the observation that petroleum formation\nrates increase with increasing sulphur content of thermally immature\nkerogen2-4, C-S bonds being weaker than C-C bonds. However, this\nexplanation fails to account for the overall composition of petroleum.\nHere I argue, on the basis of pyrolysis experiments, that it is the\npresence of sulphur radicals, rather than the relative weakness of C-S\nbonds, that controls petroleum formation rates. My findings suggest that\nthe rate of petroleum formation depends critically on the concentration of\nsulphur radicals generated during the initial stages of thermal\nmaturation. The proposed mechanism appears to provide a realistic\nexplanation for both the overall composition of petroleum and the\nobserved variation in formation rates.\n\nFigure 1 Plot of the activation energy for expelled\noil generation from type-II kerogen against the\nsulphur mole fraction ((S=1⁄2S þ Cy) of the original\nthermally immature kerogen; New Albany Shale\n(P), Woodford Shale (O), Alum Shale (B),\nPhosphoria Formation (l), and Monterey Formation\n(X). Sulphur values are for organic sulphur and do\nnot include inorganic sulphur (such as pyrite/\nmarcasite).\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nAnother important implication is that laboratory pyrolysis methods used to\nderive kinetic parameters for petroleumformation in sedimentary basins\nmust simulated this mechanism in order to provide meaningful\nextrapolations to the lower temperatures and longer times experienced in\nthe subsurface of sedimentary basins. In particular, the mechanism is not\nlikely to be stimulated by open system pyrolysis methods used to determine\nkinetic parameters, in which volatilized products are collected by sweeping\ncarrier gas over a sample as it is isothermally heated from 300 to 600 °C\nwithin tens of minutes. The problem here is that initiating sulphur radicals\ngenerated in the early stages of heating in open-system pyrolysis are\nremoved from the maturing organic matter and unavailable to participate\nfully in initiating thermal cracking reactions. Conversely, closed-system\npyrolysis, such as hydrous pyrolysis, at temperatures between 280 and 360\n°C would maintain initiating sulphur radicals in contact with thermally\nmaturing kerogen. This difference between open- and closed-system\npyrolysis provides an explanation as to why the former does not always\nshow a relationship between rates of petroleum generation and organic\nsulphur content of type-II kerogen.\n\nDetermining the temperature of petroleum formation from the kinetic properties of\npetroleum asphaltenes\nRolando di Primio*+, Brian Horsfield++ & Mario A. Guzman-Vega§\nNATURE |VOL 406 | 13 JULY 2000 173\nKnowledge of the timing and location of petroleum formation is important in\nassessing the extent of available reserves in hydrocarbon- forming basins. This\ncan be predicted from the thermal history of a basin and the kinetic parameters\nthat characterize the thermal breakdown of kerogen in source rocks. At present,\nthe kinetic parameters of kerogen breakdown are experimentally\ndetermined using immature rock samples from basin margins, but questions\nremain about the accuracy of this approach, especially when significant\nvariability is observed within individual source units. Here we show that the\nkinetics of hydrocarbon generation from petroleum asphaltenes can be used to\ndetermine the temperature conditions of the actual source rock at the time of\nexpulsion of the sampled petroleum. This relationship reflects the structural\nsimilarity of asphaltenes to the parent kerogen. We expect that our approach\nmay be used as a comparatively simple alternative method for assessing the\npetroleum generation characteristics of a given basin, which will allow for better\nestimates of the available oil resources and the risks associated with their\nexploration.\n\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nFigure 2 Activation energy distributions and calculated transformation ratios. a, b, Source rock\nkerogen correlated to the 2/2-5 oil. c d, Petroleum asphaltenes from the 2/2-5 oil.

These findings\nsuggest that petroleum generation and stability is influenced by subsurface\nchemical environments, and is a simple function of time, temperature and the\ncomposition of sedimentary organic matter.\n\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see the caption on next page.\n\nFigure 1 Chemical evolution of kerogen and petroleum during thermal maturation in\nsedimentary basins. a, Van Krevelen diagram showing the chemical evolution of\nimmature kerogen of varying composition (type I, II, III and IV) at increasing levels of\nthermal maturity (based on ref. 2).

Head, D. Martin Jones & Steve R. Larter\nNRG petroleum group, School of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Unbiversity of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle, NEI 7RU, UK\nNATURE | VOL 426 | 20 NOVEMBER 2003 | 344\nAt temperatures up to about 80 °C, petroleum in subsurface reservoirs is often\nbiologically degraded, over geological timescales, by microorganisms that\ndestroy hydrocarbons and other components to produce altered, denser 'heavy\noils'. This temperature threshold for hydrocarbon biodegradation might represent\nthe maximum temperature boundary for life in the deep nutrient-depleted Earth.\nMost of the world's oil was biodegraded under anaerobic conditions, with\nmethane, a valuable commodity, often being a major by-product, which suggests\nalternative approaches to recovering the world's vast heavy oil resource that\notherwise will remain largely unproduced.\n\n- The world's oil reserves are dominated by biodegraded heavy\nand super-heavy oils in the super-giant tar sands common in\nshallow reservoirs on the flanks of foreland basins in North and\nSouth America and elsewhere.\n- Oils are classified for economic value according to API gravity,\nbased on a surface measurement of the specific gravity of\ndegassed oil16. Heavy oils have API gravities of 20 or less,\nsuper-heavy oils have API gravities of 10 or less, and a typical\nlight marine non-biodegraded oil has an API gravity around 36-\n38 API. Tar sands are sandstones saturated with heavy or\nsuper-heavy oil: the oils in the Canadian and Venezuelan tar\nsands have API gravities of 6-12. The vast majority of heavy\noils result from microbial alteration of oils in the reservoir1, 15,\n16, 37, 84, 85, with over 50% of the Earth's oil inventory\noccurring as biodegraded oils in heavy oil and tar sand\naccumulations1. The largest single accumulations are the\nsupergiant deposits of tar sands trapped on the flanks of the\nAlberta (Canada) and Eastern Venezuelan (Venezuela) foreland\nbasins1, 84.\n\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see the caption on next page.\n\nFigure 3 The palaeopasteurization model35 of Wilhelms et al. compares continuously\nsubsiding (for example, Viking Graben, North Sea) and uplifted sedimentary basins (for\nexample, Barents Sea or Wessex Basin) and shows schematic burial history (top),\nreservoir temperature history (middle) and petroleum system (lower) events. This\nillustrates key differences with respect to biodegradation in petroleum reservoirs.\nBiodegradation of petroleum occurs only in sedimentary units that have not been\nexposed to temperatures exceeding 80 °C (palaeopasteurization) before oil charging.\nWe speculate that this 'pasteurization temperature' may represent the effective\nmaximum temperature boundary for most life in Earth struggling to survive over\ngeological timescales in hot oligotrophic sediments.\n\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nFigure 2 Saturated hydrocarbon contents and gas chromatograms of petroleum extracted from reservoir\ncores show a progressive increase in biodegradation in three wells from a Chinese oilfield19. Hydrocarbons\ndiffuse towards the oil-water contact, where they are degraded by microorganisms living near the oil-water\ncontact using nutrients derived from the water-saturated zone below the oil column.\nNutrients such as phosphorus are probably buffered by mineral dissolution reactions72. Fresh oil is charged\nto the reservoir at the same time that degradation occurs. Compositional gradients reflect this complex\ncharge and degradation scenario.\n\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see the caption on next page.\n\nFigure 4 The putative chemistry of hydrocarbon degradation in most petroleum reservoirs\nwith an absence of abundant sulphate. The overall conversion of hydrocarbons to biomass,\nmethane and carbon dioxide may well involve water-hydrocarbon reactions47, 49, with the\ncarbon dioxide produced being further reduced to methane using hydrogen produced either\nexternally to or within the reservoir. Nutrient supply from mineral diagenesis may ultimately\ncontrol the extent of hydrocarbon destruction and methane production69-72. The detailed\nmechanisms of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation are now being elucidated and many\nmechanisms involve addition of fumarate48 or carboxylation of hydrocarbons to produce\nfunctionalized intermediates, which can either be metabolized to carbon dioxide or\naccumulate as dead-end metabolites. For example, a reductive pathway for the anaerobic\ndegradation of naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene has been proposed by Annweiler and\nco-workers50. Initial carboxylation of naphthalene is followed by degradation of 2-naphthoic\nacid and, then, via a series of hydrogenation steps, to 5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid.\nFurther hydrogenation to octahydro-2-naphthoic acid may then be followed by further\ndegradation steps to produce energy and carbon dioxide or by further hydrogenation to give\ndecahydro-2-naphthoic acid (a possible dead-end metabolite). We have found these reduced\nnaphthoic acid derivatives indicative of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation in oils from all the\nbiodegraded oil provinces that we have examined51.\n\nMicroorganisms in petroleum reservoirs\nOne of the first microbiological studies of a deep subsurface environment resulted in the isolation of\nsulphate-reducing bacteria from produced waters from an oil well3. Since that time a wide range of bacteria\nhave been isolated from petroleum systems. These have exclusively come from samples of produced\nwaters. Produced waters from reservoirs undergoing water injection to enhance oil recovery are prone to\ncontamination from the injected waters, thus samples from non-water flooded reservoirs are more likely to\nyield organisms native to the petroleum reservoir, but even then non-indigenous organisms may be\nintroduced during drilling and grow in pipework in the oil well. Consequently many aerobic heterotrophic\nbacteria, many of which are capable of hydrocarbon degradation only in the presence of oxygen, have been\nisolated from well head water samples. These organisms, however, are unlikely to be native populations from\nthe petroleum reservoir.\nA wide range of anaerobic bacteria and archaea with physiological properties consistent with a deep\nsubsurface existence have also been isolated (for an excellent review, see ref. 40). These include\nfermentative thermophilic heterotrophic bacteria including Thermotoga, Thermoanaerobacter and\nFervidobacterium. Hyperthermophilic archaea such as Thermococcus and Archaeoglobus have also been\nisolated from non-flooded reservoirs. In addition, sulphate-reducing bacteria, iron-reducing bacteria and\nmethanogenic archaea have been identified in wellhead waters42. No bacteria capable of degrading\nhydrocarbons under in situ conditions have yet been isolated from petroleum reservoirs. Sediment samples\nhave now been recovered from many deep subsurface environments. These have yielded isolates with\ncharacteristics that suggest that they are true representatives of the subsurface biosphere, and it has been\npossible to measure important biogeochemical processes in these sediments. Interestingly, there are no\nreports in the literature of successful isolation or characterization of the microbial communities in sediments\nrecovered from a petroleum reservoir. The isolation and characterization of the deep slow biosphere in\npetroleum reservoirs thus remains a major challenge.\n\nThe deep biosphere\nAlthough bacteria putatively associated with deep subsurface environments were characterized in the first part of the\ntwentieth century, it is only recently that the existence of a deep subsurface biosphere has been widely accepted in the\nscientific community. Scepticism about the deep subsurface biosphere stemmed largely from concerns about the\nprovenance of organisms detected in samples taken from the subsurface, but with improved sampling techniques and\nmethods to corroborate the authenticity of organisms recovered from deep within the Earth's crust many of these\nconcerns have been dispelled. Soils and surface sediments can harbour billions of prokaryotic cells per cubic\ncentimetre, but their abundance drops off exponentially with increasing depth82. Nevertheless, some deep subsurface\nsediments still hold around 105 to 106 cells cm-3, and where carbon and energy sources are abundant, numbers may\nincrease at depth. Evidence suggests that a deep crustal biosphere beneath both land and sea has reached\napproximately 3 km below the Earth's surface, with oil biodegradation suggesting that this can be extended to at least 4\nkm. Although the number of cells per unit volume of deep subsurface sediments is relatively small, the vast extent of the\nsediments (estimated at 51025 cm3) means that total prokaryote cell numbers in all subsurface environments are of the\norder of 1030 (ref. 83). Although there are uncertainties in the estimates, and they are based on extrapolation from a\nsmall number of samples, deep subsurface microbial biomass may account for greater than 90% of global prokaryotic\nbiomass, exceeding the values for all of the world's oceans and terrestrial environments by some margin. Subsurface\nprokaryotic biomass may contain 3-51017 g of carbon, representing 60-100% of the carbon present in global plant\nbiomass. Prokaryotic cells typically contain a higher proportion of nitrogen and phosphorus than plant biomass (about\n10 times more), and thus the contribution of deep crustal microorganisms to global nitrogen and phosphorus pools is\nextremely significant83. The deep biosphere is clearly of global significance simply in terms of key elemental budgets.\nHowever, the fact that many of the organisms present may be consuming and producing inorganic and organic\ncompounds to generate energy and biomass extends their significance to the realms of biogeochemical processes. One\nsuch crucial process in the deep subsurface is the transformation of petroleum hydrocarbons to produce heavy oils by\nbiodegradation.\n\nThis image has been removed\ndue to copyright restrictions.\nDeep bacterial biosphere in\nPacific Ocean sediments\nR.

Stereospecific Numbering. In order to designate the configuration of glycerol derivatives, the carbon atoms\nof glycerol are numbered stereospecifically. The carbon atom that appears on top in that Fischer projection that\nshows a vertical carbon chain with the hydroxyl group at carbon-2 to the left is designated as C-1. To differentiate\nsuch numbering from conventional numbering conveying no steric information, the prefix 'sn' (for stereospecifically\nnumbered) is used. This term is printed in lower-case italics, even at the beginning of a sentence, immediately\npreceding the glycerol term, from which it is separated by hyphen. The prefix 'rac-' (for racemo) precedes the full\nname if the product is an equal mixture of both antipodes; the prefix 'X-' may be used when the configuration of the\ncompound is either unknown or unspecified (cf. Lip-1.10).\nExamples:\n\n(a) sn-glycerol 3-phosphate for the stereoisomer (VII = VIII), previously known as either L-a-glycerophosphate or as\nD-glycerol 1-phosphate;\n(b) rac-1-hexadecylglycerol;\n(c) 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-stearoyl-X-glycerol.\nSn-glycerol 3-phosphate.\nL-(glycerol 3-phosphate)\n\nD-(glycerol 1-phosphate)\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\nSn-glycerol 3-phosphate.\n\nCis- and trans- isomerism\nTrans fatty acids do occur in nature but, our diet,\nlargely result from processing\nThese images has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\n.\n\nTrans fats in food\nThough some trans fats are found naturally (in the milk and body fat of ruminants such as cows and sheep), the majority\nare formed during the manufacture of processed foods (see below for details). In unprocessed foods, most unsaturated\nbonds in fatty acids are in the cis configuration.\nTrans fat from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils has displaced natural solid fats and liquid oils in many areas.\nPartial hydrogenation increases the shelf life and flavor stability of foods containing these fats. Partial hydrogenation also\nraises the melting point, producing a semi-solid material, which is much more desirable for use in baking than liquid oils.\nPartially hydrogenated vegetable oils are much less expensive than the fats originally favored by bakers, such as butter or\nlard. Because they are not derived from animals, there are fewer objections to their use.\nIn the US, snack foods, fried foods, baked goods, salad dressings, and other processed foods are likely to contain trans\nfats, as are vegetable shortenings and margarines. Laboratory analysis alone can determine the amount. Outside the US,\ntrans fats have been largely phased out of retail margarines and shortenings. US food manufacturers are now also phasing\nout trans fats, but at present, most US margarines still have more trans fat than butter. In the 1950s advocates said that the\ntrans fats of margarine were healthier than the saturated fats of butter, but this has been questioned. See the saturated fats\npage for details.\nA trans configuration of hydrogen atoms\nChemistry of trans fats\nTrans fatty acids are made when manufacturers add hydrogen to vegetable oil, in the presence of small amounts of\ncatalyst metals such as nickel, palladium, platinum or cobalt -- in a process described as partial hydrogenation. If the\nhydrogenation process were allowed to go to completion, there would be no trans fatty acids left, but the resulting\nmaterial would be too solid for practical use. A claimed exception to this is Kraft Foods' new trans fat free Crisco which\ncontains the wax-like fully hydrogenated cottonseed oil blended with liquid vegetable oils to yield a shortening much like\nthe previous Crisco which was made from partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. However any hydrogenated or partially\nhydrogenated oil will contain trace amounts of the metals used in the process of hydrogenation. In a natural fatty acid, the\nhydrogen atoms usually form a double bond on the same side of the carbon chain. However, partial hydrogenation\nreconfigures most of the double bonds that do not become chemically saturated, so that the hydrogen atoms end up on\ndifferent sides of the chain. This type of configuration is called trans (which means \"across\" in Latin). The structure of a\ntrans unsaturated chemical bond is shown in the diagram.\n\nThese images has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPlease see the images on\nhttp://library.med.utah.edu/NetBiochem/FattyAcids/4_1.html\nand http://library.med.utah.edu/NetBiochem/FattyAcids/4_1d.html.\n\nWa x c o m p o n e n t s .\nWAX Æ http://www.cyberlipid.org/index.htm\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nText has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPlease see:\nhttp://www.cyberlipid.org/wax/wax0001.htm\n\nOverview of analytical approaches\n\nAcetogenic lipids in microbial mats\n\nhttp://www.rcn.montana.edu/resources/features/features.\naspx?nav=11&area=32\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPlease see:\nhttp://www.rcn.montana.edu/resources/features/features.aspx?nav=11&area=32.\n\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nPlease see:\nhttp://www.americansouthwest.net/maps/lower-geyser-basin-map.gif.\n\nHYDROCARBONS\nACYCLIC & MONOCYCLIC ALKANES\nn-alkane C17\n2-methyl- or isoalkane C18\n3-methyl- or\nanteisoalkane C18\n7-methyl alkane C18\n7,11-dimethyl alkane C19\ncyclohexyl alkane C18\nHydrocarbons\n\nHydrocarbon biomarkers of living organisms (Hedges, Wakeham & Keil)\nOrganism\nMajor Hydrocarbons\nComments\nDiatoms\nDinoflagellates\nn-C21:6 (HEH)\nAlso smaller amounts of pristane\nand n-alkanes of C21-C30\n+\nRed, green and yellow\nalgae\nn-C15 and n-C17\nSome of these algae types also\ncontain unsaturated n-C17\nhydrocarbons\nCyanobacteria\nn-C15 and n-C17\nAlso sometimes contain n-C19:1 and\nn-C19:2, and 7-and 8-methylheptane\nBacteria\nn-alkanes\nTypically produce smooth\ndistributions of n-alkanes over the\nrange of C15-C30\n+\nZooplankton\npristane in copepods, HEH\nin zooplankton eating\ndiatoms\nPristane is derived from the phytol\nside-chain of chlorophyll pigments\nVascular land plants\n(especially leaf cuticles)\nn-alkanes in the range of\nn-C25 to n-C35\n+\nCharacterized by a high odd carbon\npreference index (CPI) of 5-10\n1.

Bloch had already completed most of his thesis research at the University\nof Basel and had published two papers on that research. Still, the Basel faculty rejected it as\n\"insufficient\" (10). Bloch many years later learned that only one examiner on his committee had objected and\nthat was on the grounds that the thesis failed to cite some important references - papers authored by\nthat examiner! Looking back, Bloch realized that this may have been providential. Had he passes he decided to\nstay on in Germany. At any rate, when Bloch came to New York in 1936, Clarke, a guardian angel to refugee\nscientists, admitted him to his program and the Ph.D. was awarded about 2 years later.

Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on\nnearly complete 18S rRNA sequences of diatoms.\nSome of the sequences were published before (5);\n86 others (see table S1 for details) were determined\nin this study. The sequences of Coccoid haptophyte\nand Emiliania huxleyi were used as outgroups but\nwere pruned from the tree. Bolidomonas\nmediterranea is a sister group of the diatoms. The\ntree was created with the use of the Jukes Cantor\nmodel. HBI-biosynthesizing strains are indicated in\nred. Diatoms in green were tested but did not contain\nHBI alkenes; diatoms in black were not tested for the\npresence of HBI alkenes. The scale bar indicates\n10% sequence variation. The inset shows the\nstructure of C25 HBI alkane (27) and parent skeleton\nof C25 HBI unsaturated alkenes (7-11) produced by\ndiatoms. Note that the odd non HBI-biosynthesizing\nRhizosolenia strain, R. robusta, falls completely out\nof the Rhizosolenia phylogenetic cluster, indicating\nthat its morphological classification as a\nRhizosolenia diatom is probably wrong.\nThis image has been removed due to copyright\nrestrictions.

DELONG1*\nMonterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Moss Landing, California 95039,1 and Department of Geology\nand Geophysics, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, Massachusetts 025432\nReceived 10 October 2000/Accepted 2 February 2001\nThe oxidation of methane in anoxic marine sediments is thought to be mediated by a\nconsortium of methane-consuming archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria. In this study, we\ncompared results of rRNA gene (rDNA) surveys and lipid analyses of archaea and bacteria\nassociated with methane seep sediments from several\ndifferent sites on the Californian continental margin. Two distinct archaeal lineages (ANME-1\nand ANME-2), peripherally related to the order Methanosarcinales, were consistently\nassociated with methane seep marine sediments. The same sediments contained abundant\n13C-depleted archaeal lipids, indicating that one or both of these archaeal groups are members\nof anaerobic methane-oxidizing consortia. 13C-depleted lipids and the signature 16S rDNAs for\nthese archaeal groups were absent in nearby control sediments. Concurrent surveys of\nbacterial rDNAs revealed a predominance of d-proteobacteria, in particular, close relatives of\nDesulfosarcina variabilis. Biomarker analyses of the same sediments showed bacterial fatty\nacids with strong 13C depletion that are likely products of these sulfate-reducing bacteria.\nConsistent with these observations, whole-cell fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed\naggregations of ANME-2 archaea and sulfate-reducing Desulfosarcina and Desulfococcus\nspecies. Additionally, the presence of abundant 13C-depleted ether lipids, presumed to be of\nbacterial origin but unrelated to ether lipids of members of the order Desulfosarcinales,\nsuggests the participation of additional bacterial groups in the methane-oxidizing process.\nAlthough the Desulfosarcinales and ANME-2 consortia appear to participate in the anaerobic\noxidation of methane in marine sediments, our data suggest that other bacteria and archaea\nare also involved in methane oxidation in these environments.\n\nANME-2\nUnidentified\nbacteria\nDAPI (DNA stain)\nANME-2/Desulfosarcina/\nBacteria probes\nDiverse archaeal/ bacterial associations\nEel River Basin\nImage courtesy of Victoria Orphan.

Hmelo, Sean P. Sylva\n\nAccumulating evidence suggests that methane has been released\nepisodically from hydrates trapped in sea floor sediments during many\nintervals of rapid climate warming. Here we show that sediments from the\nSanta Barbara Basin deposited during warm intervals in the last glacial\nperiod contain molecular fossils that are diagnostic of aerobic and\nanaerobic methanotrophs. Sediment intervals with high abundances of\nthese compounds indicate episodes of vigorous methanotrophic activity in\nmethane-laden water masses. Signals for anaerobic methanotrophy in\n44,100-year-old sediment are evidence for particularly intense methane\nemissions and suggest that the basin's methane cycle can profoundly\naffect oxygen budgets in the water column.\n\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see caption on next page.\n\nFig. 1. Records of (A) carbon isotopic composition of benthic\n(left) and planktonic (right) foraminifera (5) in comparison to\n(B) abundance (left) and carbon isotopic composition (right)\nof the molecular biomarker diplopterol (hopan-22-ol, structure\nshown) in sediments deposited between 37 and 44.2 ka at\nODP Site 893 (14). Light-brown shading marks periods of\ndeposition of predominantly laminated sediments that\ncoincide with relatively warm interstadials (15). Purple\nshading designates the four excursions in the carbon isotopic\nrecord of planktonic foraminifera that had previously been\ninterpreted as evidence for particularly large releases of\nmethane (5). Benthic foraminifera are as follows: Bolivina\ntumida, B. argentea, Uvigerina peregrina, Buliminella tenuata,\nand Rutherfordoides rotundata.\n\nFigure 2.

The\nminimum isotopic\ncomposition of archaeol in\nthe 44.1-ka horizon indicates\ncontributions from\nmethanotrophic archaea. In\naddition, three 13C-depleted\ndialkylglycerolethers with\nnon-isoprenoidal alkyl\nmoieties, presumed to\nrepresent bacterial members\nof anaerobic methanotrophic\ncommunities (16, 21), were\ndetected in this sample only\n(fig.

Ulrich Wendt, Karl Poralla, Georg E. Schulz *\nThe crystal structure of squalene-hopene cyclase from Alicyclobacillus\nacidocaldarius was determined at 2.9 angstrom resolution. The mechanism\nand sequence of this cyclase are closely related to those of 2,3-oxidosqualene\ncyclases that catalyze the cyclization step in cholesterol biosynthesis. The\nstructure reveals a membrane protein with membrane-binding characteristics\nsimilar to those of prostaglandin-H2 synthase, the only other reported protein\nof this type. The active site of the enzyme is located in a large central cavity\nthat is of suitable size to bind squalene in its required conformation and that is\nlined by aromatic residues. The structure supports a mechanism in which the\nacid starting the reaction by protonating a carbon-carbon double bond is an\naspartate that is coupled to a histidine. Numerous surface\nhelices are\nconnected by characteristic QW-motifs (Q is glutamine and W is tryptophan)\nthat tighten the protein structure, possibly for absorbing the reaction energy\nwithout structural damage.\n\nReaction\nst\neps in\nsqual\nene\n-ho\npen\ne\ncyclases.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nFigure 5.

FORSTER* and KLAUS BIEMANN\nDepartment of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\nCambridge, Mass. 02139, U.S.A.\nand W. GEOFFREY HAIGH\nBiomedical Research Laboratory, Dow Corning Corporation, Midland,\nMich. 48640, U.S.A.\nand NEIL H. TATTRIE and J. ROSS COLVIN\nDivision of Biological Sciences, National Research Council of Canada,\nOttawa K1A OR6, Canada\n(Received 14 February 1973)\nA novel C35 terpene and its monounsaturated analogue were isolated from cultures\nof Acetobacter xylinum, together with traces of their C36 homologues. These\nsubstances were found to be hopane derivatives substituted by a five-carbon chain\nbearing four vicinal hydroxyl groups. For the parent hydrocarbon the term\nbacteriohopane is proposed. The elucidation of the structures utilized high-resolution\nmass spectrometry of the terpenes, degradation to C32 hydrocarbons and detailed\nmass-spectrometric comparison of these with C32 hydrocarbons synthesized from\nknown pentacyclic triterpenes. High-resolution mass-spectral data of the terpenes are\npresented. N.m.r. data are in agreement with the proposed structures, which are\nfurther supported by the isolation from the same organism of 22-hydroxyhopane and\nderivative hopene(s).\n\nHopanoid quotes\n- The formation of the more stable αβ hopane\nepimers could constitute , in a given environment,\na geochemical clock unless they happen to be still\nunrecognized constituents of living organisms\n..........

In common with other\nmonooxygenases, the epoxidase requires TPNH and molecu\nlar oxygen. Both a soluble fraction of rat liver and microᆳ\nsomes are necessary for enzyme activity Carbon monoxide\nsomes are necessary for enzyme activity. Carbon monoxide\nor potassium cyanide fall to inhibit squalene epoxidation.\nThe present paper reports some properties of t,he squalene epoxiᆳ\ndase system and describes a heat treatment of rat liver micro\ndase system and describes a heat treatment of rat liver microᆳ\nsomes which abolishes cyclase activity without impairing the\nenzymatic conversion of squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene.\nYamamoto, S. and Bloch, K.

Helge Bjorn Bode, Bernd Zeggel, Barbara Silakowski, Silke C. Wenzel, Hans\nReichenbach and Rolf Muller\nSummary\nSteroids, such as cholesterol,, are syynthesized in almost all eukaryyotic cells,, which use\nthese triterpenoid lipids to control the fluidity and flexibility of their\ncell membranes. Bacteria rarely synthesize such tetracyclic compounds but frequently\nreplace them with a different class of triterpenoids, the pentacyclic hopanoids. The\nintrig ing mechanisms in ol ed in triterpene bios nthesis ha e attracted m ch\nintriguing mechanisms involved in triterpene biosynthesis have attracted much\nattention, resulting in extensive studies of squalenehopene cyclase in bacteria and (S)\n2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases in eukarya. Nevertheless, almost nothing is known about\nsteroid biosynthesis in bacteria. Onlyy three steroid-synthesizingg bacterial sppecies have\nbeen identified before this study. Here, we report on a variety of sterol-producing\nmyxobacteria. Stigmatella Aurantiac is shown to produce cycloartenol, the well-known\nfirst cyclization product of steroid biosynthesis in plants and algae. Additionally, we\ndescribe the cloning of the first bacterial steroid biosynthesis gene cas\nencoding the\ndescribe the cloning of the first bacterial steroid biosynthesis gene, cas , encoding the\ncycloartenol synthase (Cas) of S. aurantiaca. Mutants of cas generated via sitedirected\nmutagenesis do not produce the compound. They show neither growth retardation in\ncomparison with wild typ\ny\nprotein encoded\nype nor anyy increase in ethanol sensitivity. The p\nby cas is most similar to the Cas proteins from several plant species, indicating a close\nevolutionary relationship between myxobacterial and eukaryotic steroid biosynthesis.\n\nSterol Biosynthesis in Bacteria\nSterols of Methylococcus capsulatus\nSterols of Methylococcus capsulatus\nThis image has been removed due to copyright restrictions.\nBird et al., 1971, Nature 230, 473-4\n\nPhylogenetic and biochemical evidence for an ancient origin of\nsterol bi\nl biosynthesiis in th\nthe BBactteri\nth\ni\nia\nAnn Pearson,* Meytal Budin*, and Jochen J.

The only unequivocal matches for a sterol\nbiosynthetic pathway were the a-proteobacterium, Methylococcus capsulatus,\nin which sterol biosynthesis already is known, and the planctomycete,\nGemmata obscuriglobus. The latter species contains the most abbreviated\nsterol pathway yet identified in any organism. Experiments show that the\nmajor sterols in Gemmata are lanosterol and its uncommon isomer, parkeol.\nThere are no subsequent modifications of these pproducts. In bacteria, the\nsterol biosynthesis genes occupy a contiguous coding region and possibly\ncomprise a single operon.\n\nBiomarker Numbering System\nBiomarker Numbering System\nC35 αβ-hopane\nC29 ααα-sterane (20R)\n\nSterol Diagenesis\nSterol Diagenesis\nR\nsterol\nsterene\norganisms\norganisms\no\nαα (20R)\no\nimmature\nsediments\no\nR\no\nHO\nR\no\nR\nBackbone rearrangement and reduction\nsterane\nR\no\nsterane\nimmature\nsediments\n\nββ\nββ\n\nSterane maturity parameters\nSterane maturity parameters\nsterol\norganisms\nsterane\no\nR\no\nR\norganisms\nαα (20R)\nimmature\nsediments\no\no\no\nHO\nR\nR\nR\no\nR\nR\no\no\nR\no\nββ (20S))\nββ (20R))\nαα (20S))\nmature sediments & oil\n\nSteranes\nmass spectral features\nM+\nR2\n= 372 +R+R2\n257 17α(H) steranes\n259 17β(H) steranes\n259 17β(H) steranes\n217+\nR\nR\n259/257\n262 + R2\nR\n218 > 217 in steranes with ββ config\n218 > 217 in steranes with ββ config.\n149/151 pair also sensitive to stereochemistry\n\nDiasteranes\nmass spectral features\nM+\nR\n= 372 +R\n\nSteranes - 217 Da\nC29Dia\nC29 Reg\nGippsland\nGippsland\nC27Dia\nNW Shelf\nMiddle East\n\nÆ\nIntternal St\ndard for st\ntitati\n217 D\n221 DDa\nl Stand ds f\nterane quantit tion 217 Da-\n-\n\nAGSO Standard\n217 Da\n217 Da\nFile A6MA15C:4\nSIM-GCMS: 217.196 Da\nScale Factor: 4.9\nScale Factor: 4.9\n100 %\nα 20S\nd T\nαββ 20R\nβ 20S\nC28 ααα\n+ Bica\nR\n7 βα 20S\nC29 α\nC29 αββ\nR\n8 αββ 20S\nicad T1\nC27 αββ 20S\nβα 20R\nαα 20S\nααα 20R\n7 ααα 20S\n27 ααα 20R\n20S, 24S +R\n24S + R\nC27 βα 20R\nC27\nW\nC28 αββ 20R\nC28\n+ Bi\nC\nC29\nC29 αα\nC29\nC27\nC\nααα20R +\ncad R\nC28 βα\n28 βα 20R, 2\n0 βα 20S\nBicad W\nC28 α\nBic\nC2\nC30\n30 ααα 20R\nC3\nC29 βα 20S\n+C27 αββ 20R\n48:00\n50:00\n52:00\n54:00\n56:00\n58:00\n1:00:00\nTIME (min.)\n\nFile A6MA15C:4\nSIM-GCMS: 218.203\nDa\nDa\nScale Factor: 4.1\nAGSO Standard\n218 Da\n218 Da\nβ 20R\nC29 αββ 20R\nββ 20S\n100 %\nC27 αββ\nC29 αβ\n7 αββ 20S\n8 αββ 20S\nC27\n0R\nC28\nC28 αββ 20\n48:00\n50:00\n52:00\n54:00\n56:00\n58:00\n1:00:00\nTIME (min.)\n\nSteranes: SIM -GCMS vs. MRM -GCMS\nC29 Dia+C27\nC27 Dia\nC30\nC29\nC\nSIM :217 Da\nTotal\nC29\nC27\nC28\n414 - 217\nC30\n400 - 217\nC29\n386 - 217\nC28\nC\n372 - 217\nC27\n\nC28\nC28 β\nC28\nC2\n+\nC\nC\nC\nC28\nC\nC30 β\nC30 ααα 2\nC\nC2\nC\n\nAGSO Standard: steranes SIM vs. MRM\nSIM-GCMS: 217 Da\nC27 βα 20S\nC27 βα 20R\nβα 20S, 24S +R\nα 20R, 24S + R\nBicad W\n27 ααα 20S\nC29 βα 20S\n+C27 αββ 20R\nC27 αββ 20S\nC27 ααα 20R\n29 βα 20R\nβα 20S\nC28 ααα 20S\n28 αββ 20S\nBicad T1\nC29 ααα 20R\nααα20R + Bicad R\n20R\nC29 αββ 20R\nC29 αββ 20S\n9 ααα 20S\n8 αββ 20R\n+ Bicad T\nMRM-GCMS: 400 -> 217 Da\nMRM-GCMS: 386 -> 217 Da\nMRM-GCMS: 372 -> 217 Da\n\n56 86\n\n21418 b/c +std 50ng/1000ul\n2: MRM 24 Channels EI+\n57.57\n55.95\n63.0064.23\n52.24 53.10\n56.86\nC30\n62.80\n414.423 > 217.196\n61.32\n3.02e6\n58.62\n%\nMRM -GCMS\n2: MRM 24 Channels EI+\nshowingsteranes\n61.20\n400 407\n400.407 > 217.196\n61 20\n217 196\n1.87e7\n59.91\nfrom a typical marine\n56.11\n%\n57.12\n58.76\nC29\nsediment\n55.39\n2: MRM 24 Channels EI+\nL.
