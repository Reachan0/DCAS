  "course_description": "The seminar is designed to look at the science of triathlons and sports from a molecular/chemical biological point of view. We will be able to use our own bodies to see how exercise affects the system, through observations written in a training journal. We will also improve the overall fitness of the class through maintaining a physical fitness program over the course of the term. The end of the term will have us all participate in a mini-triathlon.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nSeminars: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session\n\nWorkout Sessions: 1 / session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNone.\n\nExperimental Study Group (ESG)\n\nThe\nExperimental Study Group\nsponsors 5-10 six unit pass / fail seminars each spring on a variety of innovative subjects not covered in the regular curriculum. These seminars are open to all MIT students, as well as, ESG students and are intended to be hands-on and experiential in nature.\n\nGrading\n\nThis seminar is a Pass / Fail 6 unit seminar.\n\nTo earn a pass you must:\n\nAttend 85 % of class meetings (which means you can miss 2 meetings over the course of the term).\n\nParticipate in the class discussions.\n\nDo the readings before coming to class.\n\nMaintain a physical exercise program over the course of the term to apply the classroom knowledge to your own body.\n\nDo a literature review for a given week based on material posted on course website.\n\nParticipate in the mini-triathlon during the second last class.\n\nClassroom Component\n\nThe classroom component will introduce the students to the chemistry of their own biological system. We will be looking at nutrition (to understand how to fuel and rebuild your body), anatomy and physiology (to better build your system), and how the body can be improved (or hurt) through physical activities. To better understand the three sports, we will examine the chemistry of equipment and the event, including: swimming (wetsuit making, swimsuit manufacturing, how chlorine affects you), bicycling (including a field trip to the MIT Wind tunnel), and running (including a clinic on how to run more efficiently). We will also look at ways your body deals with exercise through building up and repair of muscles, improvement in lung and cardiovascular capacity, the chemistry of supplements and their effectiveness and new this year, looking at epigenetics (the study of heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in the DNA sequence) and how we can use it to improve our physical fitness.\n\nLaboratory Component\n\nThe practical part of the course happens once a week for an hour. The focus of the workouts is to give you a taste of triathlon training consisting of swim / bike / run brick workouts focusing on the week's themes. The students can earn up to 2 PE points during the term if they attend the supervised Triathlon training workouts. To help the student on the triathlon performance, we will be having a pre-and post cardiovascular, BMI, and VO2 testing as well as a general fitness evaluation done.",

Production of $9 million sold out with a\n33% profit. In the year before World War II,\n1941, profits were $7 million on sales of $25\nmillion. Du Pont made the nylon for over 60\nmillion pairs of sheer women's hosiery, more\nthan the number of women in the United\nStates at that time\n\nNylon\n- Made from hexamethylene diamine and adipic\nacid which are derived from the oil industry\nAnnouncement of the 75th birthday party for Nylon\n\nSupport Hose\n- Support Hose increases blood flow up the legs\nand relieves swelling in the feet\n- The stockings work by forcing the blood in the\nlower leg, where the hose is tightest, up toward\nthe heart\n- Used to prevent leg vein thrombosis\n- Ref: New York Times article on Support Hose\n- Reference:\nhttp://www.makemeheal.com/mmh/product/co\nmpression_stocking/index.vm?procid=28\n\nExercise use of Support hose\n- From the Running Times\n- Compression Socks -- snug-fitting, over-the-\ncalf socks (some of which start at the ankle)\naimed at improving oxygen delivery to\nmuscles, speeding lactic acid removal and\nstabilizing the lower leg for greater muscle\nefficiency.\n\nExercise use of Support Hose\n- Where you can get your own socks\n\nMore use of Compression clothing\n- Get running/biking compression shorts,\ncompression underwear, calf sleeves,\n- Recovery sleeves\n- Compression clothing is everywhere! Even for\nthe everyday athlete\n\nWhy spend the money on compression\nsocks?\nMenetrier et al, 2011.\nCompression Sleeves Increase Tissue Oxygen Saturation But Not\nRunning Performance\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the effects of calf\ncompression sleeves on running performance and on calf tissue\noxygen saturation (StO2) at rest before exercise and during recovery\nperiod. 14 moderately trained athletes completed 2 identical sessions\nof treadmill running with and without calf compression sleeves in\nrandomized order. Each session comprised: 15 min at rest, 30 min at\n60% maximal aerobic velocity determined beforehand, 15 min of\npassive recovery, a running time to exhaustion at 100% maximal\naerobic velocity, and 30 min of passive recovery. Calf StO2 was\ndetermined by near infra-red spectroscopy and running performance\nby the time to exhaustion.\nInt J Sports Med 2011; 32(11): 864-868,\n\nWhy spend the money on compression\nsocks?\nMenetrier et al, 2011.\nCompression Sleeves Increase Tissue Oxygen Saturation But Not\nRunning Performance\nCompression sleeves increased significantly StO2 at rest before\nexercise (+ 6.4±1.9%) and during recovery from exercise (+ 7.4±1.7%\nand + 10.7±1.8% at 20th and 30th min of the last recovery period,\nrespectively). No difference was observed between the times to\nexhaustion performed with and without compression sleeves\n(269.4±18.4 s and 263.3±19.8 s, respectively).\nInt J Sports Med 2011; 32(11): 864-868,\n\nWithin the framework of this study, the compression sleeves\ndo not improve running performance in time. However the\nStO2 results argue for further interest of this garment during\neffort recovery.\n\nMore research on compression socks\nAli et al (2011): The effect of graduated\ncompression stockings on running\nperformance.\nJ Strength Cond Res. 2011 May;25(5):1385-92. doi: 10.1519/JSC 0b013e3181d6848e.\nThe aim of this study was to examine the effects of wearing different grades of\ngraduated compression stockings (GCS) on 10-km running performance.\nAfter an initial familiarization run, 9 male and 3 female competitive runners (VO2max\n68.7 ± 5.8 ml·kg−1·min−1) completed 4 10-km time trials on an outdoor 400-m\ntrack wearing either control (0 mm Hg; Con), low (12-15 mm Hg; Low), medium (18-21\nmm Hg; Med), or high (23-32 mm Hg; Hi) GCS in a randomized counter\nbalanced order. Leg power was assessed pre and postrun via countermovement jump\nusing a jump mat. Blood-lactate concentration was assessed pre and postrun, whereas\nheart rate was monitored continuously during exercise.\n\nMore research on compression socks\nAli et al (2011): The effect of graduated\ncompression stockings on running\nperformance.\nJ Strength Cond Res. 2011 May;25(5):1385-92.\n\nPerceptual scales were used to assess the comfort, tightness, and any pain\nassociated with wearing GCS. There were no significant differences in\nperformance time between trials (p = 0.99). The change in pre to postexercise\njump performance was lower in Low and Med than in Con (p < 0.05). Mean heart\nrate (p = 0.99) and blood lactate (p = 1.00) were not different between trials.\nParticipants rated Con and Low as more comfortable than Med and Hi (p < 0.01),\nMed and Hi were rated as tighter than Low (p < 0.01), all GCS were rated as\ntighter than Con (p < 0.01), and Hi was associated with the most pain (p < 0.01). In\nconclusion, GCS worn by competitive runners during 10-km time trials did not\naffect performance time; however Low and Med GCS resulted in greater\nmaintenance of leg power after endurance exercise. Athletes rated low-grade GCS\nas most comfortable garments to wear during exercise.\n\nWorth the money?\nSperlich et al, 2010. Different types of\ncompression clothing do not increase sub-\nmaximal and maximal endurance performance\nin well-trained athletes.\nJ Sports Sci. 2010 Apr;28(6):609-14.\n\nThree textiles with increasing compressive surface were compared with\nnon-compressive conventional clothing on physiological and perceptual\nvariables during sub-maximal and maximal running. Fifteen well-trained\nendurance athletes (mean+/-s: age 27.1+/-4.8 years, VO(2max) 63.7+/-4.9 ml\nx min(-1) x kg(-1)) performed four sub-maximal (approximately 70%\nVO(2max)) and maximal tests with and without different compression\nstockings, tights, and whole-body compression suits. Arterial lactate\nconcentration, oxygen saturation and partial pressure, pH, oxygen uptake,\nand ratings of muscle soreness were recorded before, during, and after all\ntests. In addition, we assessed time to exhaustion.\n\nWorth the money?\nSperlich et al, 2010. Different types of\ncompression clothing do not increase sub-\nmaximal and maximal endurance performance\nin well-trained athletes.\nJ Sports Sci. 2010 Apr;28(6):609-14.\n\nSub-maximal (P=0.22) and maximal oxygen uptake (P=0.26), arterial lactate\nconcentration (P=0.16; 0.20), pH (P=0.23; 0.46), oxygen saturation (P=0.13; 0.26),\nand oxygen partial pressure (P=0.09; 0.20) did not differ between the types of\nclothing (effect sizes=0.00-0.45). Ratings of perceived exertion (P=0.10; 0.15),\nmuscle soreness (P=0.09; 0.10) and time to exhaustion (P=0.16) were also\nunaffected by the different clothing (effect sizes=0.28-0.85). This was the first study\nto evaluate the effect on endurance performance of different types of compression\nclothing with increasing amounts of compressive surface.\nOverall, there were no performance benefits when using the compression garments.\n\nThe real value of compression clothing\n- Is during recovery after exercise not during\nexercise\n- It is an aid to allow your muscles to recover\nfrom one workout, so you can go to the next\nworkout.\n\nClothing\n- Nylon\n- Lycra\n- Wetsuits\n- Wicking technology\n\nLycra\n- LYCRA(r) fiber is a man-made elastane fiber.\nNever used alone, but always blended with\nother fibers, it has unique stretch and\nrecovery properties. LYCRA(r) fiber adds\ncomfort, fit, shape retention, durability and\nfreedom of movement. This is achieved thanks\nto the unique properties of the fiber, which\ncan be stretched up to seven times its initial\nlength before springing back to the original\nposition once tension is released.\n\nWhat is Spandex?\n- Spandex is a man-made elastic fiber. It is derived from\ncrude oil and is described in chemical terms as\nsegmented polyurethane. It stretches under tension\nand recovers its original length when tension is relaxed.\nIt can be stretched four to seven times its original\nlength. It is combined with other 'hard' yarns to\nproduce elastane stretch fabrics.\n- Essentially, Lycra(r) and Spandex are the same thing.\nLycra(r) is a brand name. Spandex is the generic name\nused in the US and Canada for elastane. Elastane is the\nname used in the rest of the world.\n\nLycra\n- LYCRA(r) fiber was invented in 1958 by a team of\nscientists, originally as a replacement for\nrubber in corsetry. Before LYCRA(r) fiber was\ninvented, consumers endured saggy, baggy,\nstretched and bunched clothes. But when the\nDuPont scientist Joe Shiver perfected a\nrevolutionary new fiber - code named K, that\nall changed.\n\nChemical structure of Lycra\n\nLycra\n- In the 1960s, LYCRA(r) fiber revolutionized the way\nin which fabrics could be used. In beachwear it\nreplaced thick and heavy swimsuits with light,\nquick-drying garments like the bikini.\n- In 1968, the medal-winning French Olympic ski\nteam became the first high-profile sports\npersonalities to wear ski suits with LYCRA(r) fiber -\na trend that soon spread to other sports.\n- By 1972 Olympic swimmers swore by the sleek,\nlightweight suits with LYCRA(r) fiber.\n\nLycra\n- 1990s - During the 1990s, the LYCRA(r) fiber brand\nposition in the sports market strengthened\nthrough the development of hi-tech fibers such\nas LYCRA(r) PowerTM fabric in compression shorts\nwhich help reduce athletes' muscle fatigue. This\ndecade also saw the rising popularity of the fiber\nnot just in women's fashion but in men's too.\n\nLycra\n- A lot of clothing contains Lycra\n- Examples include: bathing suits, leggings, any\ncotton blend with a form fitting appearance,\ngymnastics costumes. Cycling shorts, cycling\ntops\n\nClothing\n- Nylon\n- Lycra\n- Wetsuits\n- Wicking technology\n\nWetsuits\n- Information about triathlon wetsuits\n- Don't want a wetsuit? How about a swim\nskin?\n\nFastskin(r) LZR Racer(r) by Speedo\n- The Fastskin(r) LZR Racer(r) is the result of some\nof the most extensive research in swimwear\nhistory.\n- Made from an ultra lightweight, low drag,\nwater repellent, fast drying fabric, unique to\nSpeedo, called LZR Pulse(r), the LZR Racer(r) is\nthe world's first fully bonded swimsuit.\n- look behind the technology\n\nIllegal swim suits\n- New rules for swim suits now\n\nCarbon fibers/nanotubes\n- Carbon nanotubes are single or multiple atomic\nlayers of graphite wound into tubes. Because\nof their size and composition, they have unique\nelectrical, mechanical and other physical\nproperties. Their light weight, strength and\nresistance to corrosion make them ideal for use in\na variety of applications, including flexible\noptoelectronic devices for energy harvesting\nand energy storage, compressed natural-gas\ntanks, and aerospace and sports equipment.\n\nWhere are carbon fibers found now?\nTennis\n-\nIn tennis, carbon nanotechnology is used to increase the strength of tennis\nracquets by adding carbon nanotubes to the frames which increases control\nand power when you hit the ball. Furthermore, they also reduce the rate of air\nleaks from tennis balls, so they keep their bounce longer.\n-\nNanocyl carbon nanotubes are not only added to tennis racquets to stiffen the\nracquet and to increase the power. They are also used for other sporting goods\nas golf balls and golf clubs.\nGolf\n-\nIn golf, carbon nanotubes from Nanocyl are used for filling any imperfections in\nthe club shaft materials with nanoparticles. This improves the uniformity of\nthe material that makes up the shaft and thereby improving the swing.\n-\nWhen making a golf shaft, it is not always perfectly straight. There are often\ngaps in the shaft - adding carbon nanotubes in the tiny spaces in the golf shaft,\ngives the latter a tighter molecule structure. When applied in its raw state, the\nshaft is more uniform, more consistent and more dense, which makes the golf\nshaft stronger, and by consequence straighter.\n\nhttp://www.azonano.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1956\n\nWhere are carbon fibers found now?\nFrom their website:\n-\nThe use of composite materials in the sporting goods industry has grown\nexponentially, and so has the demand for Nanocyl's EPOCYLTM products.\n-\nThese products offer sporting goods designers and manufacturers an\nintegrated, innovative technology for improving the strength, fracture\ntoughness, shelf life, and antistatic properties in composite parts.

Fuentes allegedly\nhelped riders and athletes from other unidentified sports\nengage in different kinds of drug use and blood doping to\nenhance their performance.\nThe blood doping reportedly involved drawing oxygen rich\nblood at high altitudes to obtain a concentrate of red blood\ncells, then injecting them back into riders before a race to\nboost endurance.\nArticle on-line:Eufemiano Fuentes Breaks Off Silence (\nhttp://news.softpedia.com/news/Eufemiano-Fuentes-Breaks-\nOff-Silence-28678.shtml)\n\nBlood doping\nThe best way to get around the tests is to take your\nown blood out of your body, purify the red blood\ncells (by centrifugation) and transfuse it back\ninto you\nSo basically you are giving yourself a blood\ntransfusion using your own blood\nThis does not always work, case in point - Tyler\nHamilton\n\nTyler Hamilton\n- Tyler Hamilton (born March 1, 1971, Marblehead,\nMassachusetts) is a former American professional road\nbicycle racer and Olympic gold medalist, whose career\nand reputation were repeatedly marred by doping\nscandals.\n- At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Hamilton won\nthe gold medal in the men's individual time trial. That\nmedal was placed in doubt on September 20, 2004, after\nhe failed a test for blood doping (receiving blood\ntransfusions to boost performance) at the Olympics. Two\ndays after the announcement of his positive test at\nAthens, the IOC announced Hamilton would keep his\nmedal because results could not be obtained from the\nsecond sample. The Athens lab had frozen the backup,\nwhich made it impossible to repeat the test.\n\nTyler Hamilton\n\n- The positive sample at the Olympics, and the positive test at the\nVuelta were not the only indications that Hamilton was\nmanipulating his hematocrit level. In April 2004 his blood was\nfound to have a high ratio of hemoglobin to reticulocytes (young\nred blood cells), indicative of EPO or blood doping. His score\nwas 132.9; a clean athlete would score 90. The UCI suspends a\nrider if the score exceeds 133. This sample also showed\nsomeone else's blood was in his bloodstream. However, neither\npiece of evidence in isolation constituted a positive drug test\n(and the test for a mixed cell population had not yet been\nadopted), so no action was taken.\n\nTyler Hamilton\nWhy the mixed cell population?\n- He was getting blood from someone else -\nit was a mix-up in the blood transfusion -\ncorrect type, incorrect person\n\nTyler Hamilton\n- After his suspension, Hamilton came back and became\nnational road race champion in 2008. In 2009, Hamilton\nfailed a doping test again, and this time he was banned for\neight years, which effectively caused him to retire. In July\n2010, he was subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury\nrevolving around the use of performance enhancing drugs\nin cycling. In May 2011, Hamilton admitted that he had\nused banned substances in competition, and returned his\ngold medal. As of May 2011, the IOC has not removed\nhim from the result, but is studying his confession.\nReference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Hamilton.\n\nHow can you naturally boost your red blood cell\ncount?\n\nHow can you naturally boost your red blood\ncell count?\nWork out at low O2 levels (I.e. in the mountains)\nand then race at high O2 levels (I.e. sea level)\nWhy do you think that the Olympic training facility\nis in Colorado?\n\nBiochemically, how does this work?\n\nBinding of O2 to hemoglobin (Hb)\nHb + 4 O2\nHb(O2)4\nRemember LeChatelier's principle?\n( a system at equilibrium, wants to stay there, so\nAny change in status quo prompts an opposing\nreaction in the responding system.)\nFor our system:\nSince this is an equilibrium reaction, if you\nreduce the O2, then the system will shift to make\nmore of it ( and as a result make more\nhemoglobin)\n\nAltitude Tent:\nSleep in an altitude chamber (low O2\nlevels) 2009 Colorado Altitude\nTraining 150 Tent CAT 9 Generator\n(Item: CAL800 from the\ncompetitive cyclist): cost: 4449.00\nURL:\nhttp://altitudetraining.com/main/mil\nitary/products/uncontrolled_tent/cat\n- From their website: Lance\nArmstrong was fond of saying that\nhe won the Tour in training.\nBesides the long miles, the\nmountain-based training camps, the\ncarefully-weighed food, the guy\nwas sleeping at altitude.\nCourtesy of Colorado Altitude\nTraining.

CC BY.\n\nThe test:\nFrom C& E news article\nDespite the speculation about its origin, the one thing certain\nabout the high T/E ratio is that it prompted the doping-control\nlab to pursue the matter further and retest the sample by gas\nchromatography/combustion/isotope-ratio mass spectrometry,\nwhich is considered foolproof for identifying synthetic\ntestosterone. This method determines the percent difference\nbetween the ratio of 13C to 12C in CO2 from the combustion of\ntestosterone or its metabolites in the urine sample and the 13C\nto 12C ratio of an internal CO2 standard. When synthetic\ntestosterone is used, the percent difference is reduced, by a few\npercent, relative to baseline isotope ratios of natural steroids,\ntheir precursors, and their metabolites in urine. According to\ndoping-control authorities, Landis flunked the test. (his ratio\nwas 11:1, the normal is 4:1)\n-\nReference:\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/isubscribe/journals/cen/84/i35/html/8435sci4.html\n\nThe test:\nFrom C& E news article\nThe isotope-ratio test is possible because synthesized steroids are\nmade from starting compounds (diosgenin or stigmasterol)\nobtained from soybean or other plant oils. Soybeans and most\nagricultural crops are C3 plants, which means they first form a\nthree-carbon molecule (3-phosphoglyceric acid) from CO2\nduring photosynthesis. Other plants that are integral to the\nhuman diet, such as corn and sugarcane, are C4 plants, which\nfirst form four carbon molecules (oxaloacetate, malate, and\naspartate). Because the human diet consists of a mix of C3 and\nC4 plants, naturally produced steroids will have a slightly\nhigher amount of 13C than synthetically derived steroids, hence\nthe decrease in the percent difference observed for a positive\ntestosterone doping test.\n- Reference:\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/isubscribe/journals/cen/84/i35/html/\n8435sci4.html\n\nThe Results\nFloyd Landis was be stripped of his Tour de\nFrance crown and banned from the sport for\ntwo years for testing positive for synthetic\ntestosterone after an arbitration panel on\nSeptember 20, 2007 which affirmed the\nfinding by the US Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1)\n- Insulin-like growth factor is the\nmost predominant somatomedin\nor growth factor hormone, with a\nvery similar structure to insulin\nalthough it is released by the\nliver. It plays an important role in\ngrowth and development in\nchildren and is thought to have\nanabolic effects in adults.\n- Due to perceived anabolic\neffects, athletes use IGF-1 to\nincrease muscle mass and\nstrength, although clinical\nstudies have not shown any\nincreases. It is thought that it is\nactually the IGF binding\nprotein-3 which is responsible\nfor growth rather than the\ngrowth factor itself. IGF-1\ndoes, however, inhibit cell\ndeath and so may have a role\nin reducing recovery times.\n\nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1)\n- From: http://insulin-growth-factor.com/Why-Athletes-\nBuy-IGF-1-Supplements.html\nIGF 1 has been reported to decrease the percentage of\nbody fat in body builders, athletes and fitness\nenthusiasts who use the supplement for enhancement of\ntheir workouts. This is a good reason to buy IGF. The\nhormone stimulates the release of fats from fatty cells.\nThe fats are therefore used as a source of energy in the\nmuscle cells as opposed to using carbohydrates.\nTherefore, more energy is produced and the athlete\nburns a greater percentage of fat than they normally\nwould during a workout.\n\nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1)\n- Study out of Italy showed that top level male rowers\nhad higher levels of IFG-1 levels and increased cardiac\noutput when compared to sedentary control\n- They looked a cardiac output and IGF-1 serum levels,\nbut reported no other effects\n- Shocking that the heart muscle had expanded in elite\nrowers who had high levels of physical exercise.\nVitale et al., 2008.

She retired shortly after the results\nwere announced.\n- Diego Maradona (soccer player): Was suspended from soccer\nfor 15 months in 1991 for testing positive for cocaine.\n- Michael Irvin (football player): Was arrested in 1996 for cocaine\npossession and sentenced to four years' probation. He was\nsuspended by the National Football League for five games\nReference:http://www.pharmacytechs.net/blog/top-10-performance-enhancing-\ndrugs\n\nCaffeine\n- Up until 2004 caffeine was on\nthe prohibited substances list,\nwith athletes being limited to\na urine level below 12\nmicrograms per millilitre.\nThis is equivalent to 6-8 cups\nof coffee (600-800mg).\nPerformance enhancing\neffects have since been proven\nat a much lower intake,\nbetween 2-4 cups of coffee\n(200-400mg).\n- Caffeine is a naturally\noccurring substance, found in\nover 60 different plants and is\na stimulant and mild diuretic.\nIt is the most commonly used\ndrug in the world as it is\nfound in coffee, tea, chocolate\n(and chocolate based drinks)\nand many carbonated and\nenergy drinks.\n\nCaffeine\n- Of course the other option is\nto put a complete ban on the\nuse of caffeine, this would\nhowever be impossible due to\ncaffeine staying in the system\nup to 48 hours. Therefore an\nathlete would not be able to\nhave a cup of coffee or an\nenergy drink within 48 hours\nof a competition. Random\ndrug testing makes this even\nless feasible.\n\n- WADA (World Anti-Doping\nAgency) are currently\nmonitoring the usage of\ncaffeine by athletes, as it has\nbeen suggested that since it\nwas removed from the\nprohibited list, its use has\ndramatically increased. If this\nis the case, WADA must\ndecide whether to reinstate the\nban and if the permitted\nthreshold should be lowered.\n\nCaffeine\n- Of course the other option is\nto put a complete ban on the\nuse of caffeine, this would\nhowever be impossible due to\ncaffeine staying in the system\nup to 48 hours.

Eventually\nthe signal reaches a muscle cell that tells it\nto contract. This is how you can bend your\nfinger and kick a ball. Cone snail toxins,\ncalled conotoxins, block these channels.\nWhen the channels are blocked,\ncommunication in the nervous system stops.\nThis causes paralysis.\nReference:http://www.theconesnail.com/explore-cone-snails/venom\n\nPRIALT\nPRIALT contains ziconotide, a synthetic equivalent of a\nnaturally occurring conopeptide found in the\npiscivorous marine snail, Conus magus. Ziconotide is a\n25 amino acid, polybasic peptide\nPRIALT is the only non-opioid intrathecal (IT) therapy\napproved for severe chronic pain.\nAthletes are using to mask the pain due to injuries\nReference: http://www.prialt.com/\n\nCannabinoids\n- Cannabinoids are a compound\ncontained in the Marijuana plant\nand its products. The\ncannabinoid compound contains\na substance called THC which\nhas psychoactive properties. Due\nto the fast absorption rate of\nTHC by the lungs, cannabinoids\nhave a rapid onset, with the\neffect on the central nervous\nsystem being obvious within 20\nminutes with duration lasting 4-6\nhours.\n- Cannabinoids can be\ndetected in the urine of\nan occasional user for\nup to a week following\nuse, and much longer\nfor regular users.\n\nCannabinoids\n- Cannabinoids have no positive effects on\nperformance and in fact can be detrimental.\nProlonged use can cause 'amotivational'\nsyndrome causing the user to loose focus and\ndetermination to succeed.\n- It is their analgesic (pain relief) properties which\nmake Cannabinoids prohibited in competition.\n- But prior to 1998 it was not on the list of\nperformance enhancing substances\n- What happened in 1998?\n\nCanadian Snowboarder Retains Olympic\nGold Medal After Testing Positive For\nMarijuana\nCanadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati, 26, won\nthe men's giant slalom on February 8 in the\nOlympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.\nAfter Rebagliati tested positive for marijuana --\n17.8 nanograms of metabolite per milliliter --\nthe International Olympic Committee (IOC)\nstripped him of his gold medal on February 10.\nThe following day, the IOC returned the medal,\nsaying it did not have the power to take it\nImage courtesy of Rachael Ashe Photo. CC-BY\n\nAmphetamines\n- A nervous system\nstimulant and\nappetite\nsuppressant.\n- Used to to treat\nhyperactive children,\nsleep disorders and\ndepression.\n- To increase energy\nand focus.\n\nTour de France: Whatever it takes\nEnthusiasts say the Tour de France is the biggest,\nhardest, most grueling race there is, a prize so\nprecious that cyclists will do anything to win. And\nthey have.\nIn the past, riders have scattered broken glass and\nfans have tossed nails on the road to confound\nrivals. And that's just for starters.\nIn the 1960s, riders attempted to gain a competitive\nedge with amphetamines and alcohol. In doing so,\nBritain's Tim Simpson lost his life during the\n1967 Tour.\n\nWho has been caught using\nAmphetimines?\n- Barry Bonds (baseball player): In 2006, tested positive for\namphetamines.\n- Jason Giambi (baseball player): In 2007, it was reported that he\nfailed a drug test for amphetamines. He was subjected to\ncounseling and increased testing.\n- *It should be noted that since the 1960s, widespread, open use of\namphetamine pills (\"greenies\") has been reported in professional\nbaseball. Stories of bowls of pills in locker rooms and \"special\"\npots of coffee spiked with amphetamines were common, and player\nusage was estimated by some as high as 85%. However, it wasn't\nuntil 2006 that Major League Baseball began testing for\namphetamines.\nReference: http://www.pharmacytechs.net/blog/top-10-performance-enhancing-drugs\n\nTHG: Tetrahydrogestrinone (\"the\nClear\")\n- A \"designer\" anabolic steroid (a steroid that acts as the\nhormone testosterone), created at the Bay Area\nLaboratory Co-operative (BALCO) to be undetectable\nby drug tests. Used in combination with a testosterone\nointment called \"the cream\" to avoid detection.\n- Athletic Use: To increase muscle strength and promote\nmuscle growth.\n\nWho has tested positive for\nTHG?\n- Barry Bonds (baseball\nplayer):\n- Jason Giambi (baseball\nplayer):\n- Marion Jones(track\nathlete):\n- Shane Mosley (boxer):\nUsed the BALCO products\nbefore his 2003 fight with\nOscar De La Hoya but\nclaims that he thought they\ncontained legal vitamins.\nHe has not been\ndisciplined.\n- Bill Romanowski (football\nplayer): In 2005, admitted on the\nTV show 60 Minutes that he'd\ntaken \"the cream\" and \"the clear\"\nand HGH from 2001 to 2003.\nSince he'd been retired since 2003,\nhe was not disciplined.\n- Gary Sheffield (baseball player):\nSimilar to Bonds, admitted in\n2004 that in 2002 he'd applied a\ncream to his injured knee, unaware\nthat it contained steroids. He was\nnot disciplined.\n\nMarion Jones\n- Athlete profile\n- Jones pleads guilty, admits lying\nabout steroids\n- Marion Jones had her gold medals\nstripped from her ( as well as her\nrelay teammates).\n\nHuman Chorionic Gonadotrophin\n(HCG)\n- A hormone produced\nin pregnant women by\nthe placenta.\n- Used in conjunction with\ncycles of anabolic steroid\nintake to maintain levels\nof testosterone after the\nsteroids cause the body to\nshut down testosterone\nproduction. Also helps\nrestore testicular size after\nsteroid cycles.\n\nWho has been caught using\nHCG\n- Jose Canseco (baseball player): Was caught in 2008 trying to\nsmuggle HCG across the border from Mexico without a\nprescription, claiming he needed it to jump-start the\ntestosterone in his body that had been drained from years of\nsteroid abuse He was sentenced to probation and was not\ndisciplined by Major Leage Baseball, since he'd been retired\nsince 2002.\n- Manny Ramirez (baseball player): Tested positive in 2009,\nclaiming he was given it for a \"personal health issue.\" Since\nit was added to Major League Baseball's banned substances\nlist in 2008, he was suspended for 50 games.\n\nAdrenocorticotropic Hormone\n(ACTH)\n- Adrenocorticotropic\nhormone is a\npolypeptide hormone\nproduced by the\npituitary gland. It is\nsometimes also known\nas Corticotrophin or\nAdrenocorticotrophin.\n- ACTH stimulates the\nrelease of\ncorticosteroids,\nglucocorticoids and\nsteroid hormones (or\nandrogens) from the\nadrenal glands.\n\nAdrenocorticotropic Hormone\n(ACTH)\n- ACTH is mainly used in tests\nto diagnose conditions of the\nadrenal and pituitary glands\nsuch as: Cushing's syndrome\n(an endocrine disorder caused\nby high levels of cortisol in\nthe blood)\n- Addison's disease (an\nendocrine disorder where the\nadrenal glands produce only\nlimited amounts of\nglucocorticoids)\n- Congenital adrenal\nhyperplasia (refers to a\ngroup of inherited adrenal\ngland disorders)\n- Nelson's syndrome\n(sometimes occurs\nfollowing the removal of\nboth adrenal glands as\nperformed to treat\nCushing's syndrome and is\nthe rapid development of\ngrowths on the pituitary\ngland)\n\nAdrenocorticotropic Hormone\n(ACTH)\n- ACTH is used by athletes in order to increase the amount of\nandrogens secreted by the adrenal glands as these are converted\nto testosterone. However, use also raises cortisol levels which\nincreases gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose) and\nhence raises blood glucose levels. This is achieved by the use\nof amino acids, transported from muscle to the liver to be\nconverted into glucose and also a reduction in the use of\nglucose by the cells.\n- All of this means that the positive androgenic effects are\ncancelled out by the catabolic effect (breakdown of muscle\ntissue to release amino acids) and so ACTH has no benefit and\nmay even be detrimental to performance\nReference: http://www.teachpe.com/drugs/acth.php\n\nBeta-2-Agonists\n- Beta-2-Agonists are\ndilators which cause\ndilation (widening) of\nvessels by relaxing the\nsmooth muscle\nsurrounding them.\n- Inhaled forms of Beta-2-agonists\n(including salmeterol,\nsalbutamol, formoterol and\nterbutaline) are used for the\ntreatment of Asthma and\nexercise-induced bronchospasm\n(EIB).\n- Injected forms are most\ncommonly used in the\nprevention of premature labour,\nas they act to relax the smooth\nmuscle of the uterus and so\ninhibit contractions.\n\nReference: http://www.teachpe.com/drugs/beta2.php\n\nBeta-2-Agonists\n- Inhaled forms used for the\ntreatment of Asthma and\nEIB have no performance-\nenhancing effect and so\nare permitted for use by\nWADA (world anti-\ndoping agency). The\nathlete must however be in\nreceipt of an abbreviated\ntherapeutic use exemption\n(aTUE).\n- When administered by\ninjection or tablet form they\nare thought to have anabolic\neffects (increased muscle\nmass, reduced body fat\npercentage and faster\nrecovery rates) and so their\nuse is prohibited.\n\nReference: http://www.teachpe.com/drugs/beta2.php\n\nHormone Antagonists and\nModulators\n- Hormone antagonists\nand modulators,\nsometimes known as\nanti-oestrogenic\nsubstances act to either\ndecrease the amount of\noestrogen in the body\nor block the oestrogen\nreceptors.\n- Some forms of Anti-\noestrogenic drugs have\nbeen used in the\ntreatment of breast\ncancer, contraception,\nosteoporosis and\nanovulatory infertility\n(infertility through\ncessation of\novulation).\nReference: http://www.teachpe.com/drugs/antagonists.php\n\nHormone Antagonists and\nModulators\n- The anti-oestrogenic drugs\nTamoxifen and Clomiphene are\nused by both male and female\nathletes. Males use Tamoxifen in\nconjunction with Anabolic\nSteroids in an attempt to prevent\ngynecomasia (the development\nof oversized mammary glands in\nmales). It is also used to increase\ntestosterone levels.\n- Female body-builders\nand weight lifters have\nbeen known to use\nTamoxifen as blocking\nthe oestrogen\nreceptors leaves\ntestosterone\nunapposed, leading to\nan increase in\nmasculine features.\nReference: http://www.teachpe.com/drugs/antagonists.php\n\nDiuretics\n- Diuretics (sometimes\ncalled water pills) are\ndrugs including\nFrusemide,\nChlorothiazide and\nHydrochlorothiazide.\nTheir purpose is to\nremove excess water\nfrom the body\nalthough each type of\ndiuretic does this in a\ndifferent way.\n- Diuretics are not used to\nenhance performance. If\nanything they have a\ndetrimental effect on\nperformance as they cause\ndehydration. Diuretics are\nused for two reasons..\nReference: http://www.teachpe.com/drugs/diuretics.php\n\nDiuretics\n- Firstly to loose weight\nrapidly in sports which\nrequire the athlete to\nbe within a set weight\nlimit. For example\nboxers and jockeys.\n- Secondly, to dilute the\npresence of illegal\nsubstances and aid their\nexcretion.\nReference: http://www.teachpe.com/drugs/diuretics.php\n\nGene Doping\n- Gene doping or transfer is\nbased on the principles of\ngene therapy. Here a healthy\ngene is transplanted into\ncells or directly into the\ngenome to replace a mutated\nor absent gene. Currently this\nprocess is still in the research\nand trial stage.\n- In future, athletes could\nuse this process to\ninfluence their health. For\ninstance transfer the genes\nwhich produce the\nhormone IGF-1,\ntransported into the cells\nand causing the body to\nproduce higher levels of\nIGF-1, important in the\ngrowth and development\nof musculoskeletal\nstructures.\nReference: http://www.teachpe.com/drugs/genes.php\n\nGene Doping\n- The detection of gene doping will be difficult,\nbut WADA believe it will be possible. The\ndetection process is likely to look for the\nconsequences of gene doping in blood\nsamples, rather than the gene transfer itself.\nFor example increased presence of certain\nenzymes and proteins. A second possibility is\nthe use of MRI scans to detect areas of\nunusual gene expression.\nReference: http://www.teachpe.com/drugs/genes.php\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\nES.010 Chemistry of Sports\nSpring 2013\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

This\nmakes it more accurate than determining calorie\nneeds based on total bodyweight alone. The only\nvariable it does not take into consideration is lean\nbody mass.\nTherefore, this equation will be very accurate in all\nbut the extremely muscular (will underestimate\ncaloric needs) and the extremely overfat (will\noverestimate caloric needs).\n\nHarris-Benedict formula\nMen: BMR = 66 + (13.7 X wt in kg) + (5 X ht in\ncm) - (6.8 X age in years)\n\nWomen: BMR = 655 + (9.6 X wt in kg) + (1.8 X ht\nin cm) - (4.7 X age in years)\n\n- Note: 1 inch = 2.54 cm.\n- 1 kilogram = 2.2 lbs.\nReference: http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/bmr-formula.php\n\nHarris-Benedict formula\nWomen: BMR = 655 + (9.6 X wt in kg) + (1.8 X ht in\ncm) - (4.7 X age in years)\nExample:\n- You are female\n- You are 30 yrs old\n- You are 5' 6 \" tall (167.6 cm)\n- You weigh 120 lbs. (54.5 kilos)\n- Your BMR = 655 + 523 + 302 - 141 = 1339\ncalories/day\n\nHarris-Benedict formula\nLet us calculate our BMR:\nMen: BMR = 66 + (13.7 X wt in kg) + (5 X ht in\ncm) - (6.8 X age in years)\nWomen: BMR = 655 + (9.6 X wt in kg) + (1.8 X ht\nin cm) - (4.7 X age in years)\n\nNote: 1 inch = 2.54 cm.\n1 kilogram = 2.2 lbs.\n\nBMR modifiers\nNow that you know your BMR, you can calculate total daily\nenergy expenditure (TDEE) by multiplying your BMR by\nyour activity multiplier from the chart below:\n\nActivity Multiplier\n- Sedentary = BMR X 1.2 (little or no exercise, desk job)\n- Lightly active = BMR X 1.375 (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/wk)\n- Moderately active = BMR X 1.55 (moderate exercise/sports 3-5\ndays/wk)\n- Very active = BMR X 1.725 (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days/wk)\n- Extremely active = BMR X 1.9 (hard daily exercise/sports &\n- physical job or 2X day training, i.e marathon, contest etc.)\n\nWhat does this value mean?\nEnergy in (food) = energy out - weight stays the\nsame\nEnergy in < energy out - lose weight\nEnergy in > energy out - gain weight\nYou need to make sure you are eating the\ncorrect number of calories to fit into the\ncategory you want to\n\nFood energy and how we use it\nFrom The Biology of Life, 7th edition by Sadava et al\nG\nr\na\np\nh\n\no\nf\n\nt\nhe\ntime i\nt takes\nto burn\n(throu\ngh resting,\nwalking, or j\nogging) the calor\nies foun\nd in specific f\noods.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nA balanced diet\n- Carbohydrates - 45 - 65 %\n- Fats -20-35 %\n- Proteins -10 - 35 %\n\nFood pyramid: 1992\n\nFood pyramid\n\nNew food pyramid:\nhttp://www.choosemyplate.gov/\nNow in 2011:\n-\nIntroduced along with updating of USDA food patterns for the\n2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n-\nDifferent shape to help grab consumers' attention with a new\nvisual cue\n-\nIcon that serves as a reminder for healthy eating, not\nintended to provide specific messages\n-\nVisual is linked to food and is a familiar mealtime symbol in\nconsumers'\nminds, as identified through testing\n-\n\"My\" continues the personalization approach from\nMyPyramid\n\nhttp://www.choosemyplate.gov/\n\nNow for your own personal data\nanalysis\n- Look at your sample calorie counts\n- Answer the following questions:\n1.

Bicycles can do this because\nthey very efficiently convert the power our bodies produce\ninto kinetic energy (energy of movement).\n\nLearn more at Woodford, Chris. \"The Science of Bicycles.\"\nExplainThatStuff.com/bicycles.html.

The chain drive eliminated the\nneed to have the cyclist directly above the\nwheel. Instead, the cyclist could be\npositioned between the two wheels for\nbetter balance. With the advent of gears,\nthe\ncyclist\ncould\nalso\npedal\nmore\nefficiently. Riders enjoyed increased speed\nand easier riding up steep grades.\nRead more about drives and gears on the Exploratorium's website.\n\nTorque is what makes the wheels on the bicycle go around. A\ngreat deal of research has been done to determine how to\nincrease the torque applied by the rider to the rear wheel, while\ndecreasing the torque required to make the wheels on a bicycle\nturn.\nThe series of parts that drive the bicycle forward are called the\ndrive train.\nThe torque produced by the drive train is dependent upon the\nsize of the chain ring (the large gears mounted on the crank)\nbeing used, and the size of the rear cog being used. When the\nchain is on the smaller chain ring, the force applied through the\nchain must be greater because the chain ring is closer to the\naxis of rotation and must apply a larger force to equal the\ntorque produced by the pedals.\n\nThe Gear Ratio is the relationship between the number of teeth\non two gears that are meshed or two cogs that are connected\nby a common roller chain.\n\nTo l earn more about gears, visit the Exploratorium's website.\n\n(c) Habe Retro Custom.

The earliest bicycles lacked brakes, which added\nto their daredevil reputation.\nRead more about braking and steering on the Exploratorium's website.\n\nNo matter how fast you go,\nthere comes a time when you\nneed to stop. Bicycle brakes work on a principle of basic\nphysics: friction (the rubbing force between two things that\nslide past one another while they're touching). When you press\nthe brake levers, a pair of rubber or composite shoes clamp\nonto an inner surface of the front and back wheels. As the\nbrake shoes rub tightly against the braking surface, they turn\nkinetic energy (the energy you have because you're going along)\ninto heat--which has the desired effect of slowing you down.\nCourtesy of Explain That Stuff. CC BY-NC-SA.\n\nThe coaster brake is still in\nwide use throughout the\nworld and appears in a number\nof less sophisticated bicycles\nlike cruisers and utility bicycles.\nCoaster brakes also appear on some children's bicycles and\ntricycles. The coaster brake works by reversing the motion on\nthe pedals. The brake mechanism is inside the hub of the wheel\nand pushes outward on the hub, creating friction and slowing\nthe bike. This brake is particularly strong and tends to \"lock up\"\nor skid the rear wheel when engaged.\n\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nView an image of a coaster brake.\n\nRead about caliper brakes on the Exploratorium's website.\n\nA disc brake consists\nof a metal disc\nattached to the\nwheel hub that\nrotates with the\nwheel.

Disc brakes are better than rim\nbetter than rim brakes because of\na very simple principle of physics: it is easier to stop a slower\nmoving object than it is to bring to a halt an object moving at\nhigh velocity.\n\nimage courtesy of highballblog.com\nCourtesy of High Ball Blog. Used with permission.\n\nThe newest innovation\nin high-end bicycles\nis the hydraulic brake.\nHydraulic brakes work\non the principle of\nhydraulic pressure.\nThe brake lever is used to push\nfluid (usually mineral oil or DOT fluid) from a reservoir through\na hose to move pistons in a caliper thus forcing pads against\nthe braking surface. Pushing from that central bolt is a small\npiston that pushes a cam to split the arms and bring the pads\nto the rims. The resulting braking power is stronger and easier\nto modulate. From an aerodynamic standpoint, it brings\neverything in closer and directly in front of the frame, a benefit\nto any bike, and there's no cable sticking off to the side.\nimage:Magura RT8 TT\n(c) Magura.

The most important things\nabout stopping are that you want to stop quickly, in control,\nand not go over the handlebars. As you go along on the bicycle\nand apply the brakes, your body has inertia so it has a tendency\nto continue its forward momentum. That shifts your weight\nforward onto the front wheel. So, many riders do a lot of\nbraking with the front wheel, but if you do too much braking\nwith the front wheel, you can wind up going over the\nhandlebars. So the idea of the braking the bicycle is to balance\nthe braking between the front and the back to get the\nmaximum braking.\n\nIn addition to balance, thinking and planning ahead is key to\neffective and safe braking. One of the reasons competitive\ncyclists pre-ride the courses is so they can plan braking. The\nproper technique for braking on sharp turns is to brake ahead\nof the corner, and as you go through the corner release the\nfront brake and only use the rear brake.\n\nEvery bicyclist has to overcome wind resistance. Most\nrecreational bicycles in which the rider sits upright have very\npoor aerodynamics. While newer bicycles are being designed\nwith better aerodynamics in mind, the human body is simply\nnot well designed to slice through the air. Bicycle racers are\naware of the problem of wind resistance and over the years\nhave developed techniques for minimizing its effects. Bicycle\ndesigners and inventors are constantly tinkering with bicycle\ndesigns and shapes, the size and shapes of wheels and the\ndesigns of helmets and clothing looking for improvements in\naerodynamic performance.\n\nThe handlebars of a bicycle are levers: longer handlebars\nprovide leverage that makes it easier to swivel the front wheel.\nBut the wider the arms of the cyclist are spaced, the more air\nresistance is created. That's why racing bicycles have two sets\nof handlebars to help the cyclist adopt the optimal streamlined\nposition. There are conventional, outer handlebars for steering\nand inner ones for holding onto on the straight. Using these\ninner handlebars forces the cyclist's arms into a much tighter,\nmore\nstreamlined\nposition.\nMost\ncyclists\nnow\nwear\naerodynamically shaped helmets for improved aerodynamics\n\nCourtesy of Explain That Stuff.

His\n\"mile-a-minute\" feat was accomplished in 1899. At that time he\ntraveled faster than the fastest automobile. Notice the large\nwindscreen on the train in front of him which greatly reduced\nwind resistance.\n\nOn a flat road, aerodynamic drag is by far the greatest barrier to\na cyclist's speed, accounting for 70 to 90 percent of the\nresistance felt when pedaling. The only greater obstacle is\nclimbing up a hill: the effort needed to pedal a bike uphill\nagainst the force of gravity outweighs the effect of wind\nresistance.\n\nO\nfl t\nd\nd\ni\nd\ni\nb\nf\nRead more about aerodynamic drag on the Exploratorium's website.\n\nModern bicycles are offered in a wide array of shapes and sizes.\nMost fit into one of three categories: standard, or double-diamond,\nmade from standard-sized round tubing; semi-aero, a double-\ndiamond style with the addition of airfoil-shaped tubes; and full-\naero, constructed with all airfoil-shaped tubes with or without\nalternative frame shapes to the conventional double-diamond shape,\naccording to Asker E. Jeukendrup, editor of the book \"High\nPerformance Cycling.\"\n\nFriction is a great thing in brakes and tires--but it's less\nwelcome in another form: as air resistance that slows you down.\nThe faster you go, the more drag becomes a problem. At high\nspeeds, racing a bicycle can feel like swimming through water:\nyou can really feel the air pushing against you and you use\napproximately 80 percent of your energy overcoming drag. A\nbicycle can be narrow and streamlined, but a cyclist's body is\nmuch fatter and wider. In practice, a cyclist's body creates more\nthan twice the amount of drag as the bicycle. That's why cyclists\nwear tight neoprene clothing and pointed helmets to streamline\nthemselves and minimize energy losses.\n\nCourtesy of Explain That Stuff.

It is similar to the term wheelbase used\nfor automobiles and trains.\n\nWheelbase has a major influence on the longitudinal stability of\na bike, along with the height of the center of mass of the\ncombined bike and rider. Short bikes are much more likely to\nperform \"wheelies\" and \"stoppies\".\nCourtesy of \"Bicycle and motorcycle geometry.\" on Wikipedia.\n\nRequired rake angle arose from early times when lightweight\nbicycles suffered fork failures from road shock. Most fatigue\nfailures of forks result in a fork blade breaking at the rear edge\nof the fork crown from repeated vertical road shocks. Before\nmost roads were paved, fork rake had a lower angle so the fork\nwould be loaded axially on rougher surfaces. As most roads\nbecame paved, bicycles forks were made steeper, which also\ngave lighter steering.\n\nBicycle forks usually have an offset, or rake, that places the fork\nends forward of the steering axis. This is achieved by curving\nthe blades forward, angling straight blades forward, or by\nplacing the fork ends forward of the centerline of the blades.\nThe latter is used in suspension forks that must have straight\nblades in order for the suspension mechanism to work. Curved\nfork blades can also provide some shock absorption.\n\nThe purpose of this offset is to reduce 'trail', the distance that\nthe front wheel ground contact point trails behind the point\nwhere the steering axis intersects the ground. Too much trail\nmakes a bicycle feel difficult to turn.\n\nRoad racing bicycle forks have an offset of 40-45mm. For\ntouring bicycles and other designs, the frame's head angle and\nwheel size must be taken into account when determining offset,\nand there is a narrow range of acceptable offsets to give good\nhandling characteristics. The general rule is that a slacker head\nangle requires a fork with more offset, and small wheels require\nless offset than large wheels.\n\nFork offset influences geometric trail, which affects a bicycle's\nhandling characteristics. Increasing offset results in decreased\ntrail, while decreasing offset results in increased trail.\n\nTrail, or caster, is the horizontal distance from where the\nsteering axis intersects the ground to where the front wheel\ntouches the ground. The measurement is considered positive if\nthe front wheel ground contact point is behind (towards the\nrear of the bike) the steering axis intersection with the ground.\nMost bikes have positive trail, though a few, such as the two-\nmass-skate bicycle and the Python Lowracer have negative trail.\n\nTrail is often cited as an important determinant of bicycle\nhandling characteristics and is sometimes listed in bicycle\nmanufacturers'\ngeometry\ndata,\nalthough\nWilson\nand\nPapodopoulos argue that mechanical trail may be a more\nimportant and informative variable.\n\nTrail is a function of head angle, fork offset or rake, and wheel\nsize. Their relationship can be described by this formula:\n\nRw cos(Ah)-Of\nTrail =\nsin(Ah)\n\nwhere Rw wheel radius, Ah is the head angle measured clock-\nwise from the horizontal and Of is the fork offset or rake.\n\nTrail can be increased by increasing the wheel size, decreasing\nor slackening the head angle, or decreasing the fork rake or\noffset. Trail decreases as head angle increases (becomes\nsteeper), as fork offset increases, or as wheel diameter\ndecreases\n\nCastering or Caster Angle:\nIs the angular displacement\nfrom the vertical axis of the\nsuspension of the steered wheel\nmeasured in the longitudinal\ndirection. It is the angle between\nthe pivot line and vertical.\n\nFriction allows you to turn\nF = m x a,\n* or Friction = mass x acceleration\nFriction = μ x Weight , kind of\n*μ - friction coefficient due to surface (asphalt, concrete, etc)\nMath Magic...\nRadius of turn = speed^2 / μxg\n*Must have bigger radius to go faster\n*Or must have more friction\n\nImage courtesy of Eugene Wei on Flickr.

In fact, angular momentum has\nvery little to do with the way a bicycle behaves.\n\nCentrifugal forces will throw your bike over on its side if you\nsteer the handlebars in the direction of the desired turn\nwithout first leaning the bike into the turn. Leaning the bike\ninto the turn allows gravitational forces to balance the\ncentrifugal forces, leading to a controlled and stable turn.\n\nThus: (Gyroscopic Torque) + (Moment of Inertia of Wheel\nAround Steering Axis x Acceleration of the Steering Angle) =\n(Aplied Torque on Handlebars) - (Trail-Steering) - (Castering)\n\nOne method of establishing the proper\nlean is countersteering, i.e., explicitly\nturning the handlebars counter to the\ndesired turn thereby generating centrifugal\ntorque which leans the bicycle appropriately.\n\nLearn more by reading the article, Fajans, J. \"Steering in Bicycles and Motorcycles.\" American Association of Physics Teachers, 2000.\n\nSlow down BEFORE YOU TURN\n\nBrake In A Straight Line\n\nOnly Feather Brakes In Turn If Needed\n\nLook Through The Turn For The Apex\n\nTwo diagrams that show th\ne physics\nof t\nurning.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n75A diagram that shows a curved road and an example of a turn while riding a bike.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n76 A diagram of a curved road and the proper way to turn on a bicycle.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nAerodynamics\n\nSeat adjustment\n\nPedal Stroke and Muscle Recruitment\n\n1.\nFrank Whitt's Lab Notes for Mechanical Engineering at MIT (unpublished microfiche, 1960);\n\n2.\nPhillip DiLavore, The Bicycle (Physics of Technology, AAPT, 1970);\n\n3.\nRobert Fuller and Dean Zollman, Energy Transformations Featuring the Bicycle, 1980;\n\n4.\nTraffic and Motion I & II (PLON Project in the Netherlands, 1980);\n\n5.\nDesign, Bicycles, Invention and Innovatiopn (Open University Course, Great Britain);\n\n6.\nDavid G.

It is easier for you body to deliver\noxygen to your muscles\n\nVO2 Max\nThe ability to supply energy for activities lasting more\nthan 30 seconds depends on the consumption and use\nof oxygen.\nThe rate of consumption of a given volume of O2 (VO2\nincrease as activities progress from rest to easy, to\ndifficult and finally to maximal\nThe maximum rate at which an individual can consume\noxygen (VO2 max) is an important determinant of the\npeak power output and the maximal sustained power\noutput, or physical work capacity of which an\nindividual is capable\nReference: Exercise Physiology, 4th edition Brooks et al.\n\nRelationship between oxygen consumption and external\nwork rate (power output)- graphical representation\nFrom Exercise Physiology, 4th edition, Brooks et al p6\n\nGraph o\nf power o\nutput v\ns. oxyg\nen c\nonsumpti\non: dir\nectly pro\nportional unt\nil plateau at VO2 max, t\nh\ne\nn vertical decline.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nVO2 Max\nWhen the VO2 test was done in your fitness\nassessment, the following information was\nincorporated in the data:\n- Workload (kg m/min)\n- Heart rate at the two workloads\n- Plotted HR (y-axis) vs. workload (x axis), then\nwhere the line intercepted at predicted max\nheart rate, is the Max O2 (L/min)\n- Divide this number by your body weight in kg\n(convert L to ml), then you get Max O2 in\nml/kg/min\n\nHow can we improve our VO2\nManipulate the heart rate\n- Heart is a muscle and if it gets regularly\nexercised, it will be more efficient.\n- How can you improve your heart muscle?\n\nImprove your heart muscle\nWork out at your targeted heart rate.\nFirst you need to calculate your maximum heart\nrate;\n- The easiest way to do this is to use the\nfollowing formula: 220 - age\n- Now to improve your heart muscle, you need\nto work on in your target heart rate which is\n55 to 85 % of your maximum heart rate\n- Let us calculate the range for targeted heart\nrate for your age at 65 %, 70 % and 85 %\n\nTarget Heart Rate\nAge\nTarget HR Zone\n50-85 %\nMaximum Heart Rate\n100 %\n20 years\n100 - 170 beats per minute\n200 beats per minute\n25 year\n98-166 beats per minute\n195 beats per minute\n30 years\n95-162 beats per minute\n190 beats per minute\n35 years\n93-157 beats per minute\n185 beats per minute\n40 years\n90-153 beats per minute\n180 beats per minute\n45 years\n88-149 beats per minute\n175 beats per minute\n50 years\n85-145 beats per minute\n170 beats per minute\n55 years\n83-140 beats per minute\n165 beats per minute\n\nHow should I pace myself? (from the\nAmerican Heart Association website)\nWhen starting an exercise program, aim at the\nlowest part of your target zone (50 percent)\nduring the first few weeks. Gradually build up to\nthe higher part of your target zone (75 percent).\nAfter six months or more of regular exercise, you\nmay be able to exercise comfortably at up to 85\npercent of your maximum heart rate. However,\nyou don't have to exercise that hard to stay in\nshape.\n\nWorkload\nThe Maximum workload is measured in Watts\n(joules per second).\nIt is a measure of power\nThink it as the maximum amount of work that\nyou can do in a second. This is sometimes\nreferred to as critical power\n\nCycling Test\nThe purpose of these tests is to calculate the\nVO2 max.\nThis is accomplished by having the subject work\nout at 60 to 70 % of VO2 and use this value to\ncalculate VO2 max\n\nDark-side Cycling Test\nVolitional: The act or an instance of making a conscious choice or\ndecision.

As early as his second\nyear of medical school (1926), he began developing his\nnow-famous theory of the influence of stress on people's\nability to cope with and adapt to the pressures of injury and\ndisease. He discovered that patients with a variety of\nailments manifested many similar symptoms, which he\nultimately attributed to their bodies' efforts to respond to\nthe stresses of being ill. He called this collection of\nsymptoms--this separate stress disease--stress syndrome,\nor the general adaptation syndrome (GAS).\nThere are three stages involved in response to a stressor:\nalarm reaction, resistance development and exhaustion\n\nThe Alarm reaction\nInitial response to the stressor involves the\nmobilization of systems and processes within the\norganism\nFor instance, during exercise the stress of running is\nsupported by the strain of increasing oxygen\ntransport through an augmentation of cardiac\noutput and a redistribution of blood flow to\nactive muscle\nRemember that that body has a limited capacity to\nadjust to various stressors - homeostasis must\nnot be affected long-term\n\nResistance Development\nThe body improves its capacity or builds its reserves\nduring the resistance stage of GAS\nThis stage represents the goal of physical\nconditioning.\nYou need to make sure that you are at the critical\nthreshold to achieve this state (not above or\nbelow)\nRemember that if you are sick, that your ability to\neffectively workout may be diminished. You might\nend up hurting yourself instead of improving\n\nExhaustion (or distress)\nThis occurs when stress becomes intolerable,\nand can either be acute or chronic\nAcute exhaustion can be fractures, sprains or\nstrains\nChronic exhaustion (overtraining) examples\ninclude stress fractures, emotional problems,\nand soft tissue injuries\n\nOverload principle\nApplication of an appropriate stressor will cause\nthe body to respond and adapt\nOverload is a positive stressor that can be\nquantified according to load (intensity and\nduration), repetition, rest and frequency\n\nLoad\nThis refers to the intensity of the exercise\nstressor\nFor strength training - load refers to the amount\nof resistance\nFor running and swimming - it refers to speed\nIn general, the greater the load, the greater the\nfatigue and recovery time required\n\nRepetition\nThis is the number of times the load is applied\nMore favorable adaptation tends to occur (up to\na point) when the load is administered more\nthan once.\nThere is no agreement on the number of\nrepetitions you should do\n\nRest\nThis is the time interval between repetitions as\nwell as the interval between training sessions\nVitally important for obtaining an adaptation\nand should be applied according to the nature\nof the desired physiological outcome.\nResting is a necessary part of training because\nadaptations occur during recovery\n\nFrequency\nThis is the number of training sessions per week\nYou need to listen to your body to decide on the\ntotal number of times you work out.\nFor triathlon training - you rotate through the\ndifferent sports on different days generally\nstarting with one a day workouts and building\nup to twice a day workouts.\nThen once a week you do a brick workout ( bike\nfollowed by a run)\n\nOther Training strategies\nSpecificity -\n- don't over train specific part of your body - think of the\nbody as a whole\n- Also, the close the training routine to the requirements\nof competition, the better the outcome\nReversibility\n- Inactivity will lead to performance decrement\nIndividuality\n- You need to listen to your body and adapt your training\nregime to fit your body\n\nRepair and Maintenance of your\nbody\nWhat happens when you work out?\n\nIt's Not About the Lactic Acid: Why You're\nStill Sore After Yesterday's Ride\n- Lactic acid is completely washed out of the\nmuscles within 30 to 60 minutes after you\nfinish riding.

Chemical irritants are released\nfrom the damaged muscles and can irritate pain\nreceptors. In addition to the injured fibers, there\nis increased blood flow from increased activity to\nthe muscle, causing a swelling of the muscle\ntissues, which causes enough pressure to\nstimulate pain receptors. Instead of having free-\nmoving muscle fibers the next morning, you have\nfibers that are fatigued, have microscopic tears\nand are swollen.\nhttp://www.active.com/mountainbiking/Articles/It_s_not_about_the_lactic_acid__Why_y\nou_re_still_sore_after_yesterday_s_ride.htm\n\nSo where does the lactic acid come\nfrom?\n\nSo where does the lactic acid come\nfrom?\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nLearn more about the breakdown of glucose.\nWith this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis\n\nRepair and Maintenance of your\nbody\nSo now you need to be able to repair those\nmuscle fibers.\nWhat do you need to build new muscle fibers?\n\nRepair and Maintenance of your\nbody\nSo now you need to be able to repair those\nmuscle fibers.\nWhat do you need to build new muscle fibers?\nAmino acids!

At this time, the cuff is just below the diastolic\npressure in the artery.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nSee image of how to measure blood pressure.\n\nBike Test\nYMCA Sub Max Cycle Ergometer Test\nThe test:\nRide at 50 rpm at a given resistance and state\nthe perceived level of exertion (on a scale of 1\nto 10)\nIncrease resistance but maintain 50 rpm and\nkeep going until about 75-85% of heart rate\nmax (70% of heart rate reserve) is reached.\nOnce test is completed, do a cool down\n\nMax VO2\nVO2 is the maximum rate at which an individual\ncan consume oxygen\nWhy test VO2?\n\nWhy VO2?\n- VO2 is an important determinant of the peak\npower output and the maximal sustained\npower output or physical work capacity of\nwhich an individual is capable.\n- It depends on the capacity of the\ncardiovascular system.\n- It has emerged as the single most important\ncriterion of physical fitness.\n\nReference: Brooks, Fahey and Baldwin,Exercise physiology 4th edition, pp 5-7\n\nFitness Assessment\n- Goal is to look at your baseline fitness and see\nif you can improve it over the course of the\nterm\n- This is accomplished through a regular\nexercise program\n\nFitness Assessment\nSigning up for the fitness assessment: budget on\n45-60 minutes\nTimes available:\nSign up on the excel sheet\n\nNeed to fill out the fitness assessment form\nbefore you leave today.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\nES.010 Chemistry of Sports\nSpring 2013\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
