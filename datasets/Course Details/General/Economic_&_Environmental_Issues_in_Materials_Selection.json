  "course_description": "Choice of material has implications throughout the life-cycle of a product, influencing many aspects of economic and environmental performance. This course will provide a survey of methods for evaluating those implications. Lectures will cover topics in material choice concepts, fundamentals of engineering economics, manufacturing economics modeling methods, and life-cycle environmental evaluation.",

  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\n3.012, 3.014, 3.022, 3.024, or permission of instructor.\n\nCourse Readings\n\nBecause the course covers a broad range of topics, there is no single textbook. However, I would recommend that students purchase the following text. It provides some coverage of the engineering economics topic, provides useful information on the general issues covered in class, and is very affordable:\n\nde Neufville, R.\nApplied Systems Analysis: Engineering Planning and Technology Management\n. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1989. ISBN: 9780070163737.\n\nClass readings and homework problems will be assigned from the following books:\n\nSullivan, W., E. Wicks, and J. Luxhoj.\nEngineering Economy\n. 12th ed. East Rutherford, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 2002. ISBN: 9780130673381.\n\nAshby, M. F.\nMaterials Selection in Mechanical Design\n. 3rd ed. San Diego, CA: Elsevier, 2005. ISBN: 9780750661683.\n\nBauman, H., and A. Tillman.\nHitch Hiker's Guide To LCA: An Orientation in Life Cycle Assessment Methodology and Application\n. Lund, Sweden: Studentlitteratur AB, 2004. ISBN: 9789144023649.\n\nStudents will also be expected to consult the course lecture slides and other readings assigned during the term.\n\nCourse Software\n\nThe course projects and many of the homework assignments rely heavily on the use of spread-sheet tools.\n\nThe instructors are most familiar with Microsoft(r) Excel and Lotus(r) 123, and will provide support for running exercises with this software. However, students can use any package that can run the models, with the understanding that support will be limited if the product is unfamiliar to the instructors.\n\nAll software for the course will be provided in DOS/Wintel format, but students can process assignments on any computer system. Note that the Microsoft(r) Excel materials are readable across platforms.\n\nGrading\n\nGrades will be based on various assignments throughout the term. Their approximate weights are:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nProblem Sets\n\n20%\n\nMid-semester Quiz 1 - Engineering Economy\n\n15%\n\nMid-semester Quiz 2 - Material Selection and Cost Modeling\n\n15%\n\nUnit Projects\n\nEngineering Economy\n\n10%\n\nMaterials Selection\n\n10%\n\nCost Modeling\n\n15%\n\nLCA (Integrative)\n\n15%\n\nThe final grade will be modulated by an appreciation of the participant's progress throughout the semester, giving extra weight to those that finish strongly and demonstrate that they have mastered the material, in the end.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nAbsences\n\nStudents are expected to complete all assignments on time. Unexcused late assignments will be marked down. Reasonable excuses (sickness, unavoidable professional absences, family emergencies, etc.) will of course be accepted when presented near the event.\n\nWork in Teams\n\nStudents will likely work in teams for the unit projects. Indeed, we encourage this collaboration because it can lead to more interesting results.\nWe require each student to turn in individually written interpretations of the common analysis\n.\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nTo avoid any potential confusion that might result from different expectations in other courses or establishments, please note the standards that apply in this subject:\n\nAnyone found cheating during the in-class exam will receive a zero for the exercise.\n\nAssignments turned in for grading are to be done individually, although it is expected that students will discuss the issues involved in problem sets and often learn best collectively. In practice this means that students may lead each other to the proper understanding of the material, and collaborate on setting up computer runs, but should ultimately prepare reports for each assignment individually, in their own format and words. Demonstrated evidence of copying (exactly the same presentations, same wording of sentences, etc.) will result in zeros for each paper with this evidence.",

It is essential that the clamp have low\nthermal inertia so that it reaches temperature quickly, and it must not\ncharge-up when exposed to an electron beam. The approximate time\nt it takes a component of thickness x to reach thermal equilibrium\nwhen the temperature is suddenly changed (a transient heat flow\nproblem) is:\nt = x2/2a where a is the thermal diffusivity.\nThe time to reach thermal equilibrium is reduced by making the\nsection x thinner, but it must not be so thin that it fails in service.\nModeling tips\nConsider the portion of the C-clamp with length H as a beam with\na square cross-section of width x and depth b. It is subject to a\nbending moment that is generated by the force F.\nF\nX\nX\nL\nM\nM\nH\nFigure by MIT OCW.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nMaterials Systems Laboratory"
