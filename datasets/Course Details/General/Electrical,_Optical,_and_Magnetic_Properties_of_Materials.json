  "course_description": "This class discusses the origin of electrical, magnetic and optical properties of materials, with a focus on the acquisition of quantum mechanical tools. It begins with an analysis of the properties of materials, presentation of the postulates of quantum mechanics, and close examination of the hydrogen atom, simple molecules and bonds, and the behavior of electrons in solids and energy bands. Introducing the variation principle as a method for the calculation of wavefunctions, the course continues with investigation of how and why materials respond to different electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic fields and probes and study of the conductivity, dielectric function, and magnetic permeability in metals, semiconductors, and insulators. A survey of common devices such as transistors, magnetic storage media, optical fibers concludes the semester.\nNote: The Magnetics unit was taught by co-instructor David Paul; that material is not available at this time.",

What does it mean for an operator Oˆ to be linear and hermitian?\n2. Prove which of the following operators is linear, and which is hermitian:\nd\n1 d\n,\n, x\ndx\ni dφ\n3. Let's consider a particle of mass m trapped in a one dimensional well of\nlength a. The wavefunction of the particle is given by ψ(x) = Ax(a - x).\nThe wavefunction is zero outside the well.\na) Find a value for A such that the wavefunction is normalized over the\ninterval [0, a].\nb) Calculate the expectation value of the position x of the particle in the\nwell.\nc) What is the expectation value of the kinetic energy of the particle in\nthe well?\nThe 2D electron gas\n2D electron gases are observed at the interface between a semiconductor and a\nmetal. One of the easiest model used to describe the main properties of the 2D\nelectron gas is to consider non-interacting free electrons. In this model, we\nconsider that the Coulomb repulsion between electrons is zero and that they do\nnot feel any forces inside the box. This problem is concerned with the proper\nderivation of the eigenfunctions and the energy eigenvalues of a free electron in\na 2D geometry.\n2.1\nGeneral solution for the 3D case\nLet's consider a box of dimensions Lx and Ly in respectively the x and y direc\ntions, and w in the z direction. An electron is enclosed in this box and cannot\nescape from it, but the electron is free to move inside it. This means that the\npotential energy of the electron is zero inside the box and infinite outside it.\nNicolas Poilvert & Nicola Marzari\n\nq\nq\nq\nq\nq\nSince the electron cannot escape, then the electron's wavefunction has to vanish\non the sides of the box. So we will write that:\nψ(0, y, z) = ψ(Lx, y, z) = 0 for the x direction\nψ(x, 0, z) = ψ(x, Ly, z) = 0 for the y direction\nψ(x, y, 0) = ψ(x, y, w) = 0 for the z direction\nThose constitute the boundary conditions for our problem.\n1) Write down the Schrodinger equation for an electron moving inside the\nbox.\nNow we will make the ansatz that you have seen in class and use the method\nof separation of variables to solve the Schrodinger equation. The wavefunction\ncan be written as: ψ(x, y, z) = X(x)Y (y)Z(z).\n2) Translate the boundary conditions for ψ in the x, y and z directions in\nboundary conditions for respectively the X, Y and Z fonctions.\n3) By using the ansatz for the wavefunction ψ, write the left hand side of\nthe Schrodinger equation as a sum of 3 terms that are respectively fonctions of\nx, y and z only. The right hand side is reduced to a constant E.\n4) The only mathematical solution for the Schrodinger equation expressed\nin question 3) is that each term of the equation is equal to a constant and that\nthose constants add up to E. Let's call Ex, Ey and Ez those constants. Write\ndown the 3 separate equations for the X, Y and Z functions.\nThe general solution for those three equations should be:\n2mEx\n- X(x) = Ax sin(kxx) + Bx cos(kxx) with kx =\nh 2\n2mEy\n- Y (y) = Ay sin(ky y) + By cos(kyy) with ky =\nh 2\nZ(z) = Az sin(kz z) + Bz cos(kz z) with kz =\n2mEz\n-\nh 2\n5) Use the boundary conditions found in question 2) to find the allowed values\nfor Ex, Ey and Ez in terms of integers nx, ny and nz. Find which constants\nin the set (Ax, Ay, Az , Bx, By, Bz) are zero and simplify the general solutions\nfor X, Y and Z. Finally write down the allowed total energies (the eigenen\nergies) E(nx, ny, nz ) and the associated allowed wavefunctions (the eigenfunc\ntions) ψnx,ny ,nz (x, y, z).\nAt this stage we see that we still have some unknowns in the problem,\nnamely the normalization constants in front of the eigenfunctions. Let's denote\nby Anx,ny ,nz the constants in front of ψnx,ny ,nz (x, y, z). We know from physical\nintuition that the probability of finding the electron inside the box is 1. So for\nany eigenfunction, we must have:\nR Lx R Ly R w ψ∗\n(x, y, z)ψnx,ny ,nz (x, y, z)dxdydz = 1\nnx,ny ,nz\nThis is the normalization condition for the eigenfunctions.\n6) Using the analytical expressions for the eigenfunctions obtained in ques\ntion 5), prove that:\nAnx,ny ,nz =\nLxL\ny w =\nV\n8 , where V is the volume of the box\n\n2.2\nWhen can we talk about a 2D gas?\nNow that we have solved our problem mathematically, let's have a closer look\nat the energy eigenvalues:\nE(nx, ny, nz ) = h 2π2 ( n x\n+\nn y\n+ n z\n2 ) = h2 ( n x\n+\nn y\n+ n z\n2 )\n2m\nL2\nL2\nw\n8m\nL2\nL2\nw\nx\ny\nx\ny\n1) What is the energy difference ΔEx between state E(nx +1, 0, 0) and state\nE(nx, 0, 0)? In the same way, calculate ΔEy = E(0, ny + 1, 0) - E(0, ny, 0) and\nΔEz = E(0, 0, nz + 1) - E(0, 0, nz ).\n2) Calculate the ratios ΔEz and ΔEz .\nΔEx\nΔEy\n3) Now imagine that the box is very elongated in the x and y directions, i.e\nLx and Ly are macroscopic, and very thin in the z direction. To make things\nclearer, let's take w ∼ 10nm and Lx = Ly ∼ 1μm, which are typical dimensions\n2nz +1\n2nz +1\nin semiconductor/metal junctions. In real devices the ratios 2nx+1 and 2ny +1\nare of order unity. Knowing this, give a typical value for the ratios calculated\nin question 2).\n4) From the numerical result of question 3), what can you deduce in terms\nof level spacings in x and y directions compared to the level spacing in the\nz direction? In which direction(s) of space can you consider that the allowed\nenergy states form a quasi-continuum and in which direction(s) the allowed\nenergy levels are quite well separated?\nWhen talking about real devices (that are always 3-dimensional), we can\nspeak of a 2D gas of electrons when the motion of each electron is \"frozen\"\nin one direction (let's call it the z direction) and not in the two others (x and\ny). By \"frozen\", we mean that the energy difference between the energy states\ncaracterized by nz = 1 and nz = 2 is bigger than any typical thermal energy\nkB T .\n5) Calculate the energy difference ΔEz = E(0, 0, 2) - E(0, 0, 1) in a GaAs\ndevice for which the width w is 10nm and the mass of the electron is m∗ =\n0.067m, where m is the mass of the electron in vacuum (m= 9.109 ∗ 10-31kg).\nWhat is the temperature T corresponding to this energy difference, i.e such that\nkB T = ΔEz? Is the motion of the electron in the z direction \"frozen\" for this\nsystem when operated at room temperature (300K)?"

What does it mean for an operator Oˆ to be linear and hermitian?\nsolution:\nlinearity We say that an operator Oˆ is linear when we have the following\nequality for any wavefunctions ψ(~r), φ(~r) and any complex numbers α, β:\nOˆ(αψ(~r) + βψ(~r)) = αOˆ(ψ(~r)) + βOˆ(φ(~r))\nhermiticity We say that operator Oˆ is hermitian when we have the\nfollowing equality for any wavefunctions ψ(~r), φ(~r):\nˆ\nR\nr) ˆ\nR\n( ˆ\nˆ\nψ|Oφ =\nψ∗(~ O(φ(~r))d3~r =\nO(ψ(~r)))∗φ(~r)d3~r = Oψ|φ\n2. Prove which of the following operators is linear, and which is hermitian:\nd\n1 d\n,\n, x\ndx\ni dφ\nsolution:\nd\nd\nd\nlinearity of x , dx and 1\ni dx\nLet's call Oˆ the following operator: dx . To\ncheck the linearity we must verify that: Oˆ(αψ(x) + βψ(x)) = αOˆ(ψ(x)) +\nd\nβOˆ(φ(x)), which gives us\n(αψ(x) + βψ(x)) = α d (ψ(x)) + β d (φ(x)).\ndx\ndx\ndx\nBut this result is true because the derivative of a sum of functions is just\nthe sum of the derivatives. If we multiply this equality by 1\ni , we can\nd\neasily conclude that 1\ni dφ is also linear. The linearity of the x2 operator is\nobvious: x2(αψ(x) + βψ(x)) = αx2ψ(x) + βx2ψ(x).\nhermiticity of x2\nLet's now look at the property of hermiticity. We\nstart with the x2 operator. We first write down the\nψ xˆ2φ\nintegral,\nwhich is:\nψ∗(x)x2(φ(x))dx. Then we move the x2 term to the left and\nfind\nx2ψ∗(x)(φ(x))dx. Now since x2 is real we see that (Dx2ψ(x))E\n∗ is\nthe same thing as x2ψ∗(x). We can then conclude that:\nψ xˆ2φ\n=\nψ∗\nD(x)x2(φE(x))dx =\n(x2ψ(x))∗φ(x)dx, and this last term is nothing\nbut xˆ2ψ|φ , which proves that x2 is hermitian.\nNicolas Poilvert & Nicola Marzari\n\nR\nD\nE\nR\nnon-hermiticity of d\nWe will now focus on operator d . Let's express\nD\ndx\nˆ\nE\nR\ndx\nthe first integral:\nψ\nd φ =\nψ∗(x) d (φ(x))dx. The \"trick\" is then to\ndx\ndx\n|\nR b du(x)\nintegrate by part. Using the integration by part formula:\nv(x)dx =\nd\n[u(x)v(x)]b\nR b u(x) dv(x) dx, we find that\nD\nψ ˆ φ\nE\n= [ψ\na\n∗(x\ndx\n)φ(x)]+inf\na\ndx\ndx\na -\n|\n-inf -\n+inf dψ∗(x) φ(x)dx. The first term on the right-hand side of the last equa\n-inf\ndx\ntion is zero, because if a wavefunction does not vanish at infini\nties, then this wavefunction can never be square integrable, i.e\nthat the integral of its square modulus is a finite number. Us\ning this result, we can re-write\nD\nψ ˆd φ\nE\nas -\nR +inf dψ∗ (x) φ(x)dx. The\ndx\ndx\n|\n-inf\nd\nlast step consists in realizing that dψ∗(x) = ( dψ(x) )∗, because\n(ψ∗(x)) =\ndx\ndx\ndx\nd (Re(ψ(x))-i.Im(ψ(x))) = dRe(ψ(x)) -i. dIm(ψ(x)) = ( dRe(ψ(x)) +i. dIm(ψ(x)) )∗ =\ndx\ndx\ndx\ndx\ndx\n( dψ(x) )∗.

Let's consider a particle of mass m trapped in a one dimensional well of\nlength a. The wavefunction of the particle is given by ψ(x) = Ax(a - x).\nThe wavefunction is zero outside the well.\na) Find a value for A such that the wavefunction is normalized over the\ninterval [0, a].\nsolution:\nWe know from the lectures that the square modulus of the wavefunction\ngives us the probability to find a particle at a certain position ~r in space.\nIf this is so, then we must be certain to find the particle somewhere in\nspace. The mathematical translation of this physical intuition is expressed\nthrough the nomalization condition:\nR +inf\n2dx = 1 (in this one\n-inf |ψ(x)|\ndimensional case). Let's apply this normalization condition to our case of a\nparticle in a one-dimensional well. We know that the wavefunction is zero\noutside the well, we can then conclude that the limits ±inf in the integral\ncan be reduced to 0 and a. Using this we find that the normalization leads\nus to:\na |Ax(a - x)|2dx = 1\n\nq\nq\nR\nR\nR\nD\nE\nD\nE\nThis equation gives us right away that: |A| =\n5 . We see that we\na\nfound the modulus of A and not A itself. But this is a general feature of\nwavefunctions in quantum mechanics. Wavefunctions are defined up to a\nglobal phase. This means in particular that taking A as a real number\nequal to\na\n30 is perfectly suitable!\nb) Calculate the expectation value of the position x of the particle in the\nwell.\nsolution:\nBy definition the expectation value of the position operator ˆx is given\nby (for a correctly normalized wavefunction):\nhψ|xψ\nˆ i = hxψ\nˆ |ψi = hψ|xˆ|ψi =\nψ∗(x)xψ(x)dx\nInjecting the analytical expression of the wavefunction with the correct\nnormalization constant, we find:\nxˆ ψi =\na(Ax(a - x))∗xAx(a - x)dx =\na Ax(a - x)xAx(a - x)dx =\nhψ| |\nA2 a\n30 a 6\na\n=\n=\na5 60\nc) What is the expectation value of the kinetic energy of the particle in\nthe well?\nsolution:\nBy definition, the expectation value of the kinetic energy is given by:\nR a\nh 2 d2\nψ|Tˆ|ψ = 0 ψ∗(x)(- 2m dx2 )ψ(x)dx\nThe second derivative of ψ(x) gives us -2A, so we finally obtain that:\nψ| ˆ\n= 5 h2\nT |ψ\nma\nThe 2D electron gas\n2D electron gases are observed at the interface between a semiconductor and a\nmetal. One of the easiest model used to describe the main properties of the 2D\nelectron gas is to consider non-interacting free electrons. In this model, we\nconsider that the Coulomb repulsion between electrons is zero and that they do\nnot feel any forces inside the box. This problem is concerned with the proper\nderivation of the eigenfunctions and the energy eigenvalues of a free electron in\na 2D geometry.\n2.1\nGeneral solution for the 3D case\nLet's consider a box of dimensions Lx and Ly in respectively the x and y direc\ntions, and w in the z direction. An electron is enclosed in this box and cannot\nescape from it, but the electron is free to move inside it. This means that the\npotential energy of the electron is zero inside the box and infinite outside it.\nSince the electron cannot escape, then the electron's wavefunction has to vanish\non the sides of the box. So we will write that:\n\nψ(0, y, z) = ψ(Lx, y, z) = 0 for the x direction\nψ(x, 0, z) = ψ(x, Ly, z) = 0 for the y direction\nψ(x, y, 0) = ψ(x, y, w) = 0 for the z direction\nThose constitute the boundary conditions for our problem.\n1) Write down the Schrodinger equation for an electron moving inside the\nbox.\nsolution:\nThe stationnary Schrodinger equation for one electron in a potential V (~r)\nis:\nh 2 ~ 2ψ(~r) + V (~r)ψ(~r) = Eψ(~r)\n2m\n-\nr\nNow if the potential is zero, then the equation reduces to the following:\nh 2 ~ 2ψ(~r) = Eψ(~r)\n2m\n-\nr\nNow we will make the ansatz that you have seen in class and use the method\nof separation of variables to solve the Schrodinger equation. The wavefunction\ncan be written as: ψ(x, y, z) = X(x)Y (y)Z(z).\n2) Translate the boundary conditions for ψ in the x, y and z directions in\nboundary conditions for respectively the X, Y and Z fonctions.\nsolution:\nIf the analytical expression of ψ is the following: ψ(x, y, z) = X(x)Y (y)Z(z)\nthen the boundary conditions give us:\nψ(0, y, z) = ψ(Lx, y, z) = 0 gives X(0)Y (y)Z(z) = 0 and X(Lx)Y (y)Z(z) = 0\nfor any y and z\nψ(x, 0, z) = ψ(x, Ly, z) = 0 gives X(x)Y (0)Z(z) = 0 and X(x)Y (Ly)Z(z) = 0\nfor any x and z\nψ(x, y, 0) = ψ(x, y, w) = 0 gives X(x)Y (y)Z(0) = 0 and X(x)Y (y)Z(w) = 0\nfor any x and y\nWe can then conclude that we must have X(0) = X(Lx) = 0, Y (0) = Y (Ly) = 0\nand Z(0) = Z(w) = 0. Those are the boundary conditions for our functions X,\nY and Z.\n3) By using the ansatz for the wavefunction ψ, write the left hand side of\nthe Schrodinger equation as a sum of 3 terms that are respectively fonctions of\nx, y and z only. The right hand side is reduced to a constant E.\n4) The only mathematical solution for the Schrodinger equation expressed\nin question 3) is that each term of the equation is equal to a constant and that\nthose constants add up to E. Let's call Ex, Ey and Ez those constants. Write\ndown the 3 separate equations for the X, Y and Z functions.\nsolution:\nLet's use the analytical expression ψ(x, y, z) = X(x)Y (y)Z(z) and inject this\nexpression in the Schrodinger equation. Deriving ψ(x, y, z) = X(x)Y (y)Z(z)\npartially with respect to x (leaving y and z constant) gives us ∂ψ(x,y,z) =\n∂x\ndX(x) Y (y)Z(z), and the same kind of result is valid when deriving partially\ndx\nwith respect to y and z. Using this result, we find that the Schrodinger equa\ntion can be written as:\n\nq\nq\n- h 2\nd2 X(x) Y (y)Z(z) + X(x) d2Y (y) Z(z) + X(x)Y (y) d2Z(z)\n=\n2m\ndx2\ndy2\ndz2\nEX(x)Y (y)Z(z)\nDividing the equation by X(x)Y (y)Z(z) gives us:\n- h 2\n1 dX + 1 dY + 1 dZ\n= E\n2m\nX dx\nY dy\nZ dz\n1 dY\n1 dZ\nNow if we move the Y dy and Z dz terms to the right-hand side of the equation,\nwe see that:\n- h 2\n1 dX = E + h 2\n1 dY + 1 dZ\n2m\nX dx\n2m\nY dy\nZ dz\nThe function on the left-hand side is only a function of x, whereas the right-\nhand side is only a function of y and z. Moreover this equation is true for\nany x, y and z. So the only way we can achieve this is by taking the two sides of\nthis equation equal to a given constant Ex. We then end up with the following\ntwo equations:\nh2\n\n1 dX\n2m\nX dx\n-\n= Ex\nh 2\n1 dY + 1 dZ\nE + 2m\nY dy\nZ dz\n= Ex\nRearranging the second equation, we find:\nh 2\n1 dY + 1 dZ\n-2m\nY dy\nZ dz\n= E - Ex\nRepeating the whole argument on this new two-dimensional Schrodinger-like\nequation, we can conclude that we must have a second constant Ey such that:\nh2\n2m\nY dy\n\n1 dY\n-\n= Ey\nand\nh2\n\n1 dZ\n- 2m\nZ dz = E - Ex - Ey\nCalling Ez the constant on the right-hand side of the previous equation, we\ncan finally write the 3 equations that we extracted from the full Schrodinger\nequation:\n- h 2 1 dX\n= Ex\n2m\nX dx\n- h2\n1 dY\n= Ey\n2m\nY dy\nh2\n-\n1 dZ = Ez\n2m\nZ dz\nWe also have E = Ex + Ey + Ez.\nThe general solution for those three equations should be:\nX(x) = Ax sin(kxx) + Bx cos(kxx) with kx =\n2mEx\n-\nh 2\n2mEy\n- Y (y) = Ay sin(ky y) + By cos(kyy) with ky =\nh 2\n\nq\n\nq\nq\nZ(z) = Az sin(kz z) + Bz cos(kz z) with kz =\n2mEz\n-\nh 2\n5) Use the boundary conditions found in question 2) to find the allowed values\nfor Ex, Ey and Ez in terms of integers nx, ny and nz. Find which constants\nin the set (Ax, Ay, Az , Bx, By, Bz) are zero and simplify the general solutions\nfor X, Y and Z. Finally write down the allowed total energies (the eigenen\nergies) E(nx, ny, nz ) and the associated allowed wavefunctions (the eigenfunc\ntions) ψnx,ny ,nz (x, y, z).\nsolution:\nThe boundary conditions found in question 2) were X(0) = X(Lx) = 0,\nY (0) = Y (Ly) = 0 and Z(0) = Z(w) = 0. Using the analytical expressions\ngiven above for the X, Y and Z functions, we find that:\n- First, using X(0) = 0, Y (0) = 0 and Z(0) = 0, we easily conclude that\nBx = By = Bz = 0\n- Second, using X(Lz) = 0, Y (Ly) = 0 and Z(w) = 0 we conclude that\nAx sin(kxLx) = Ay sin(kyLy) = Az sin(kz w) = 0\nIn this second conclusion, we realize that we cannot take the constants Ax,\nAy and Az to be zero, otherwise the X, Y and Z functions would be zero\neverywhere and the wavefunction itself would be zero everywhere. We must\nthen have sin(kxLx) = 0, sin(kyLy ) = 0 and sin(kzw) = 0. But since the sin\nfunction is only zero when the argument of the function is an integer multiple\nof π, we find that there must exist a set of three integer numbers (nx, ny, nz )\nsuch that:\nkxLx = nxπ, kyLy = ny π and kz w = nz π\nFinally we use the relationship between k and E (E = h 2k2 ) to give the allowed\n2m\neigenenergies:\nh 2\nn 2\nx π2\nn 2\ny π2\n+ n 2\nz π2\nE(nx, ny, nz ) = Ex + Ey + Ez = 2m\nL2 + L2\nw2\nx\ny\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are:\nψnx,ny ,nz (x, y, z) = AxAyAz sin(nxπ L\nx\nx ) sin(nyπ L\ny\ny ) sin(nzπ w\nz )\nAt this stage we see that we still have some unknowns in the problem,\nnamely the normalization constants in front of the eigenfunctions. Let's denote\nby Anx,ny ,nz the constants in front of ψnx,ny ,nz (x, y, z). We know from physical\nintuition that the probability of finding the electron inside the box is 1. So for\nany eigenfunction, we must have:\nR Lx R Ly R w ψ∗\n(x, y, z)ψnx,ny ,nz (x, y, z)dxdydz = 1\nnx,ny ,nz\nThis is the normalization condition for the eigenfunctions.\n6) Using the analytical expressions for the eigenfunctions obtained in ques\ntion 5), prove that:\nAnx,ny ,nz =\nLxL\ny w =\nV\n8 , where V is the volume of the box\n\nR\nR\nq\nq\nsolution:\nUsing the shorthand notation Anx,ny ,nz for the constants AxAyAz , we can\nrewrite the eigenfunctions as:\nψnx,ny ,nz (x, y, z) = Anx,ny ,nz sin(nxπ L\nx\nx ) sin(ny π L\ny\ny ) sin(nz π w\nz )\nNow we inject this expression in the normalization condition and find:\nR\nLx R\nLy R\nw |Anx,ny ,nz |2 sin2(nxπ L\nx\nx ) sin2(nyπ L\ny\ny ) sin2(nzπ w\nz )dxdydz = 1\nThis 3 dimensional integral can be separated in a product of three one dimen\nsional integrals. The one dimensional integral over the x coordinate is:\nR Lx sin2(nxπ x )dx\nLx\nTo integrate this integral, we use the following well-known trigonometric equal\nity: sin2(u) = 1-cos(2u) and the fact that\ncos(u)du = sin(u). Hence we have:\nR\nLx sin2(nxπ L\nx\nx )dx = L\nx - 1\n2 [sin(2nxπ) - sin(0)]\nNow since nx is an integer, sin(2nxπ) is zero and so is sin(0). In the end, the\none dimensional integrals reduce to:\nR\nLx sin2(nxπ L\nx\nx )dx = L\nx\nR\nLy sin2(ny π L\ny\ny )dy = L\ny\nw\nw\nsin2(nz π x )dx =\nw\nAnd we easily conclude that:\n|Anx,ny ,nz | =\nLxL\ny w\nAs in the case of question 3)a) of exercise 1, we see that an eigenfunction is\ndefined up to a global phase, so we can choose Anx,ny ,nz to be real and equal\nto\n.\nLxLy w\n2.2\nWhen can we talk about a 2D gas?\nNow that we have solved our problem mathematically, let's have a closer look\nat the energy eigenvalues:\nh 2π2 ( n 2\nx\nn 2\ny + n 2\nz\nh2 ( n 2\nx\nn 2\ny + n 2\nz\nE(nx, ny, nz ) = 2m\nL2 + L2\nw2 ) = 8m\nL2 + L2\nw2 )\nx\ny\nx\ny\n1) What is the energy difference ΔEx between state E(nx +1, 0, 0) and state\nE(nx, 0, 0)? In the same way, calculate ΔEy = E(0, ny + 1, 0) - E(0, ny, 0) and\nΔEz = E(0, 0, nz + 1) - E(0, 0, nz ).\nsolution:\nWe use the formula for the einergy eigenvalues to find:\nh2π2\nh2π2\nΔEx = E(nx + 1, 0, 0) - E(nx, 0, 0) = 2\n\nmL2 ((nx + 1)2 - nx\n2 ) = 2\n\nmL2 (2nx + 1)\nx\nx\n\nh 2π2\nΔEx = 2mL2 (2ny + 1)\ny\nΔEz = h2π2\n2 (2nz + 1)\n2mw\n2) Calculate the ratios ΔEz and ΔEz .\nΔEx\nΔEy\nsolution:\nFrom question 1), we easily conclude that:\nΔEz = ( Lx )2( 2nz +1 )\nΔEx\nw\n2nx+1\nΔEz\n+1\n= ( Ly )2( 2nz\n)\nΔEy\nw\n2ny +1\n3) Now imagine that the box is very elongated in the x and y directions, i.e\nLx and Ly are macroscopic, and very thin in the z direction. To make things\nclearer, let's take w ∼ 10nm and Lx = Ly ∼ 1μm, which are typical dimensions\nin semiconductor/metal junctions. In real devices the ratios 2nz +1 and 2nz +1\n2nx+1\n2ny +1\nare of order unity. Knowing this, give a typical value for the ratios calculated\nin question 2).\nsolution:\nFrom the ratios found in question 2), and knowing that 2nz +1 and 2nz +1\n2nx+1\n2ny +1\nare of order unity, we conclude that:\nΔEz = ΔEz ∼ ( Lx )2\nΔEx\nΔEy\nw\n4) From the numerical result of question 3), what can you deduce in terms\nof level spacings in x and y directions compared to the level spacing in the\nz direction? In which direction(s) of space can you consider that the allowed\nenergy states form a quasi-continuum and in which direction(s) the allowed\nenergy levels are quite well separated?\nsolution:\nFrom question 3), we see that the level spacing in the z direction are of order\n( L\nw\nx )2 greater than in directions x and y. The levels are much closer in energy in\nthe x and y directions than in the z direction, so a quantum particle will \"feel\"\nthis difference, and the motion in the z direction will be quantized. A small\nthermal energy will be sufficient to have the quantum particle jump from one\nenergy state to the next in the x and y directions, so we can safely describe the\nenergy states as forming a quasi-continuum in the x and y directions.\nWhen talking about real devices (that are always 3-dimensional), we can\nspeak of a 2D gas of electrons when the motion of each electron is \"frozen\"\nin one direction (let's call it the z direction) and not in the two others (x and\ny). By \"frozen\", we mean that the energy difference between the energy states\ncaracterized by nz = 1 and nz = 2 is bigger than any typical thermal energy\nkB T .\n5) Calculate the energy difference ΔEz = E(0, 0, 2) - E(0, 0, 1) in a GaAs\ndevice for which the width w is 10nm and the mass of the electron is m∗ =\n0.067m, where m is the mass of the electron in vacuum (m= 9.109 ∗ 10-31kg).\nWhat is the temperature T corresponding to this energy difference, i.e such that\nkB T = ΔEz? Is the motion of the electron in the z direction \"frozen\" for this\nsystem when operated at room temperature (300K)?\nsolution:\nWe find that:\n\nΔEz = E(0, 0, 2) - E(0, 0, 1) = 3 h 2π2\n2mw2\nPlugging in the values for m and w, we end up with:\nΔEz = E(0, 0, 2) - E(0, 0, 1) ≈ 2.7 ∗ 10-20J which is about 0.17 eV\nThe corresponding temperature T is T ≈ 0.17eV ≈ 1950K! So we would need to\nkB\nheat the device up to temperatures close to 1900K to start seeing higher energy\nlevels in the z direction to be populated. We can safely say that the motion\nof electrons in this device operating at 300K is \"frozen\" in the z direction, and\nthat we are dealing with a 2D electron gas (if dimensions in x and y directions\nare much bigger than in the z direction)."

To find those molecular orbitals, we will use a well-known tech\nnique in Quantum Chemistry called the Linear Combinaition of Atomic Orbitals\n(LCAO). The spirit of the technique is the following: Imagine that you take two\nhydrogen atoms far from each other. In that case each atom has one elec\ntron, and the wavefunction of each electron is described by a 1s atomic orbital,\nφ1s =\ne- a\nr\n0 , where a0 is the Bohr radius. When one then reduces the\n√\nπa3\ndistance between the two hydrogen atoms up to atomic dimensions, the ground\nstate wavefunction of each electron is no longer described by a 1s orbital because\nan electron localized around one of the proton can hop to the second proton of\nthe H2 molecule. So what is the wavefunction then? The LCAO technique ap\nplied to the case of the H2 molecule consists in writing the total wavefunction of\nan electron as a linear combinaison of two 1s orbitals, one centered around each\nproton. The new wavefunction is then called a molecular orbital because it\nspreads over the entire molecule and is not localized around a particular atom.\nHence the molecular orbital looks like this:\nψ = c1φ1s(1) + c2φ1s(2)\nNicolas Poilvert & Nicola Marzari\n\nR\nR\nR\n\nwhere (1) and (2) stand for proton 1 and 2.

Since we expressed the electronic wave-\nfunction as a linear combinaition of φ1s(1) and φ1s(2) only, we need to find\nthe hamiltonian matrix in the basis formed by those two atomic orbitals if we\nwant to be able to find the eigenenergies (i.e the molecular energies) and the\ncorresponding eigenfunctions (i.e the molecular orbitals). So we see that instead\nof expressing the hamiltonian in an infinite and complete basis, we chose a\ntwo-dimensional basis. This is clearly an approximation but if the two basis\nfunctions are carrefully chosen, then the eigenfunctions obtained by diagonaliz\ning the hamiltonian matrix in this 2-dimensional basis can be very accurate in\ndescribing the \"exact\" molecular orbitals.

We have seen in class the angular momentum operator Lˆ, which is a\nvectorial operator, i.e it has 3 coordinates ( Lˆx, Lˆy and Lˆz ) that are actually\noperators of their own. Now suppose you want to know what is the y projection\nof the spin of an electron described by the spin vector above (|ψi). For this you\nneed the expression of the y projection of the spin operator Sˆy:\nSˆy =\ni\n-i 0\nUsing the principles of Quantum mechanics, answer the following questions:\n1. What are the possible measurement results for the y projection of the\nspin?\nsolution:\nAccording to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the only possible result\nof the measurement of the physical quantity s is one of the eigenvalues of\nthe corresponding operator Sˆy. Thus we need to determine the eigenvalues\nof Sˆy by solving : det( Sˆy - λIˆ)= 0. The second order algebraic equation\nthat we obtain is: λ2 -1 = 0. Solutions are ±1. Consequently, the possible\nmeasurement results are s1 = -1 and s2 = 1.\n2. Is |ψi normalized?\nsolution:\nTo check whether |ψi is normalized, we must verify that its norm\nhψ|ψi\nequals 1:\np\nu\n\nhψ|ψi = t ( √1\n2 )∗, (- √1\n2 )∗ ·\n-\n√\n√\nWe then find that\nhψ|ψi = 1 such that |ψi is indeed normalized.\n\ns\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n3. Is |ψi an eigenvector of the spin operator Sˆy?\nsolution:\nTo check whether |ψi is an eigenvector of Sˆy, we need to determine whether\nSˆy |ψi = s |ψi where s is one of the eigenvalues calculated before. The\nmatrix product gives us:\n\n!\n\n!\n-i\ni\n√\n√\n=\n-i\n-i\n- √\n√\nBut this last vector cannot be written as s ψi (check it), so ψi is not an\neigenvector of Sˆy.\n|\n|\n4. What are the eigenvectors of Sˆy ?\nsolution:\nTo calculate the first eigenvector of Sˆy, we need to solve the equation\nSˆy |u1i = s1 |u1i. The matrix product gives us:\n\ni\nx1\nx1\n-i 0\nx2\n= -\nx2\nwhich reduces to a single equation : x1 + iy1 = 0. Consequently we have\ny1 = - 1\ni x1 = ix1. Now we want to normalize our vector, so we impose:\np\nx1\nhu1|u1i = 1 =\n((x1)∗, (ix1)∗) ·\nix1\nwe then end up with x1 =\nand so\n=\n√\ni2\n. In the same\n|\n|\n√\n|u1i\n√\nway we find that the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue s2 = 1 is\n√\n|u2i =\n- √i\n5. Can you express |ψi in terms of the eigenvectors of Sˆy?\nsolution:\nThe eigenvectors |u1i and |u2i form an orthonormal basis set of the spin\nvector space. As a result, ψi can be written as a linear combinaison of\n|u1i and |u2i:\n|\n|ψi = α |u1i + β |u2i\nThe coefficiants are nothing but the projections of |ψi onto the corre\nsponding basis vector. For example:\n\nα = hu1|ψi =\n( √1\n2 )∗, ( √i\n2 )∗ ·\n-\n√\n√\n\nso we easily find that α = 1+i . In the same way we find that β = 1-i and\nwe conclude that:\n1+i u1i + 1-i\n|ψi =\n2 |\n2 |u2i\n6. What would be the probability of obtaining each one of the possible mea\nsurement results for the y projection of the spin?\nsolution:\nAccording to the postulates of quantum mechanics, when the physical\nquantity s (here the y projection of the spin) is measured on a system\nin the normalized state |ψi, the probability P (s = s1) of obtaining the\nmeasurement result s = s1 is:\nP (s = s1) =\n2 = ( 1+i )∗( 1+i ) = 1\n| hu1|ψi |\nSimilarly, the probability P (s = s2) of obtaining the measurement result\ns = s2 is:\nP (s = s2) = |\n|\n|2 = ( 1-i )∗( 1-i ) = 1\nhu2 ψi\n7. What is the quantum state of the particle after each possible measure\nment?\nsolution:\nStill following the postulates of quantum mechanics, if the result of the\nmeasurement is s = s1 the state of the system immediately after the mea\nsurement is |u1i (that is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue\ns1). Similarly, if the result is s2, the particle goes in the state |u2i."

The physical system will\nbe an electron moving from a piece of metal right through a vacuum region\ntowards another piece of metal. What we want to calculate is the electrical\ncurrent that tunnels through the vacuum layer.\n1.1\nModeling the system\nWe have already seen the problem of an electron in an infinite well in one\ndimension. We solved for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. In reality an\nelectron in a metal does not \"hit\" an infinite wall of potential but a finite wall.\nSo we will model an electron in a piece of metal as being trapped inside a box\nwith a finite height of potential. Inside the metal the electron will not feel\nany potential and outside it, i.e in the vacuum region, the potential energy of\nthe electron will be V0. At this stage we will introduce the concept of Fermi\nenergy. In a metal the Fermi energy is the highest occupied energy. This means\nthat each eigenstate with an energy between 0 and EF will be occupied by 2\nelectrons (because each energy state can be occupied by one \"spin up\" electron\nand one \"spin down\" electron). A sketch of the potential energy landscape seen\nby an electron in this problem is shown on figure 1.\n1.2\nMathematical solution for our model\nImportant: Do not worry about the Fermi energy. We will come back\nto this notion later in the problem and you can just \"forget\" it right\nnow.\nIn this part we would like to solve for the wavefunction of an electron in the\npotential landscape shown on figure 1. In our model we will take the lowest\noccupied level as our reference energy. The vacuum energy is called V0 and\ncorresponds to the potential energy of an electron in vacuum. We will consider\nthe problem of an electron of energy E in the potential energy landscape shown\non figure 1. Let us denote by (I), (II) and (III) the three different regions of\nspace as shown on figure 1.\nNicolas Poilvert & Nicola Marzari\n\na\nV(x)\nV0\nx\nmetal\nvacuum\nmetal\nEF\n(I)\n(II)\n(III)\nFigure 1: Sketch of a piece of metal (the STM tip on the left) hanging above\nanother piece of metal (the surface to study on the right). Here the potential\nenergy landscape felt by the electron in the different regions of space is shown.\n1) Write down the stationnary Schrodinger equation for the electron in the\nthree different regions (I), (II) and (III).\n2) We will consider that 0 < E < V0, where E is the total energy of the elec\ntron (appearing on the right-hand side of the Schrodinger equation). Given this,\nexpress the general solution of the Schrodinger equation in respectively regions\n(I), (II) and (III) in terms of imaginary and/or real exponential functions.\n3) What we want to describe in our problem, is an electron coming from\nthe left-hand side (in region (I)) and going through the vacuum layer towards\nthe right-hand side (in region (II)). Considering that eikx describes a travelling\nwave going to the right and e-ikx a travelling wave going to the left, we see\nthat we will have to rule out some unphysical solutions in the general solution\nof question 2). Indeed, since the electron comes from the left, the initial wave\neikx in region (I) will be reflected at the boundary between regions (I) and (II),\nand so there must be a wave like e-ikx in region (I) to indicate the presence of\na reflected wave. On top of having a reflected wave at the boundary between\nregions (I) and (II), some part of the wavefunction of the electron may tunnel\nthrough the vacuum layer and let a transmitted wave emerge in region (III).\nSo in region (III), there must be a wave like eikx to indicate the presence of a\ntransmitted wave. But there cannot exist any wave like e-ikx in region (III)\nbecause it would describe an electron coming from the right! Having said that,\ncan you simplify the general solution of the Schrodinger equation in region (III)?\n4) In this problem, the potential energy of the electron is a piecewise function,\nbut the discontinuities between regions (I) and (II) and between regions (II) and\n(III) are finite. This means that the wavefunction and its first derivative will\nbe continuous at the discontinuities, i.e x = 0 and x = a. Write down the four\nequations corresponding to the continuity conditions for the wavefunction and\nits first derivative at x = 0 and x = a.\n5) From question 4), we see that we end up with a system of 4 equations for\n5 unknown. But what we are interested in, is the amount of transmitted wave\n(in region (III)) with respect to the incoming wave (in region (I)). So what we\ncan do is to divide the four equations of the system by the constant in front\n\nof the incoming wave eikx in region (I). That way we will define the reflection\ncoefficiant r as being the ratio between the coefficiant in front of the reflected\nwave e-ikx in region (I) and the coefficiant in front of the incoming wave eikx\nin region (I). Similarly, we will define the transmission coefficiant t, as being\nthe ratio between the coefficiant in front of the transmitted wave eikx in region\n(III) and the coefficiant in front of the incoming wave eikx in region (I). Using\nthose notation re-write the system of 4 equations for the 4 unknown ratios.\n6) From the system of 4 equations in question 5), we can solve for t and find\nthe following result:\n|t|2(E) =\nV 2\n1 p\n2m\n1+ 4E(V0\n-E) sinh2(a\nh2 (V0-E))\n\nWhat we want to calculate now is the transmitted current density with respect\nto the incoming density. The classical expression for the current density of\na single electron is: j = -ev, where -e is the charge of the electron and v is its\nvelocity. Can you express j in terms of the momentum p? From that expression,\nexpress the quantum equivalent of the current density, i.e the quantum current\ndensity operator. Finally calculate the ratio h\nh\nj\nj\nt\nii\ni between the expectation value\nof the quantum current density operator in region (III) and the expectation\nvalue of the quantum current density operator in region (I) (for the incoming\nwave only!).\nRemark: if you feel unconfortable with the normalization of the transmitted\nwave eikx (because you don't know what the boundaries of the integral are), it\ndoesn't matter, because in this case you are interested in the ratio of two current\ndensities that will each contain an integral of a complex exponential, and those\ntwo integrals will cancel out.\n1.3\nPhysical discussion\n7) In question 6), we have been expressing the expectation value of the current\ndensity operator when the electron is described by a wavefunction ψ correspond\ning to eigenenergy E. As I explained in the first section of this problem, in a\nmetal, all the eigenenergies E up to the Fermi energy EF are occupied by two\nelectrons. If the two metals (on both side of the vacuum region) have the same\nvalue for EF , what do you think will be the \"net\" current tunneling through\nthe vacuum region? Explain your answer.\n8) From question 7), we see that in order to break the symmetry of the\nproblem and create a net current from the tip towards the surface, we need\nto introduce a bias. This is achieved by connecting the two pieces of metal to\na generator that will introduce a little potential difference V between the two\nmetals. If one wants a net flow of electrons from the left to the right, can you\nshow on a diagram what the shift in the Fermi energies of the two metals should\nbe?\nRemark: In a given potential configuration, an electron always goes where\nthe potential is smaller in order to minimize its total energy.\n9) Now let us imagine that the bias between the two metals is really small. If\nthis is the case then most of the net current result from the motion of electrons\nfrom the left to the right with an energy corresponding to the Fermi energy\nE = EF . Let us introduce φ = V0 - EF . φ is called the \"work function\" of the\nmetal. Can you simplify the expression obtained in question 6) (at E = EF )\n\ne\nwhen the argument of the sinh is big (Remember that sinh(x) ≈\nx when\nx >> 0)? Give a result in terms of φ, EF , V0, a and fondamental constants like\n\nIn this simplified expression, what is the caracteristic decay length\nh, and m.\nof the current density? For a (100) surface of Aluminum, the work function is\nφ ≈ 4.20eV. Can you give an estimate for the caracteristic decay length? From\nthis value, conclude about the capability of an STM device to image a surface\nup to atomic dimensions.\n10) From question 9) we come to the conclusion that, when a small bias exists\nbetween the two metals, the current density is exponentially depending on the\ndistance a between the two metals and so the device (the STM) is extremely\nsensitive to the distance between the tip and the metal surface. From there, can\nyou think of a measurement setup that would allow us to image the surface?"

Hence the stationnary Schrodinger equation can be written as:\nh 2 d2\n-\ndx2 ψ(x) = Eψ(x) regions (I) and (III)\n2m\nIn region (II), the electron feels a potential of intensity V0. The Schrodinger\nequation is then:\nh 2 d2\n-\ndx2 ψ(x) + V0ψ(x) = Eψ(x) region (II)\n2m\n2) We will consider that 0 < E < V0, where E is the total energy of the elec\ntron (appearing on the right-hand side of the Schrodinger equation). Given this,\nexpress the general solution of the Schrodinger equation in respectively regions\n(I), (II) and (III) in terms of imaginary and/or real exponential functions.\nsolution:\nIn regions (I) and (III), the Schrodinger equation can be re-written as:\nd2\ndx2 ψ(x) + k2ψ(x) = 0 regions (I) and (III)\nwhere k is the wavevector of the electron (k2 = 2mE ).\nh 2\nIn region (II), the Schrodinger equation looks the same as above but with a\nminus sign in front of the linear term in ψ:\nd2\ndx2 ψ(x) - κ2ψ(x) = Eψ(x) region (II)\nwhere κ is given by κ2 = 2m(V\nh\n-E) .\nThe first Schrodinger equation is well-known and we solved for it many times.\nThe solution is a linear combinaison of complex exponentials like:\nψ(x) = Aeikx + Be-ikx region (I)\n\nψ(x) = Eeikx + Fe-ikx region (III)\nThe second Schrodinger equation is well-known in mathematics. The general\nsolution for such an equation is a linear combinaison of real exponentials like:\nψ(x) = Ceκx + De-κx region (II)\n3) What we want to describe in our problem, is an electron coming from\nthe left-hand side (in region (I)) and going through the vacuum layer towards\nthe right-hand side (in region (II)). Considering that eikx describes a travelling\nwave going to the right and e-ikx a travelling wave going to the left, we see\nthat we will have to rule out some unphysical solutions in the general solution\nof question 2).

This means that the wavefunction and its first derivative will\nbe continuous at the discontinuities, i.e x = 0 and x = a. Write down the four\nequations corresponding to the continuity conditions for the wavefunction and\nits first derivative at x = 0 and x = a.\nsolution:\nAt x = 0, we have the following continuity conditions:\n- A + B = C + D continuity of ψ\nik(A - B) = κ(C - D) continuity of dψ\n-\ndx\nAt x = a, we have another set of continuity conditions:\n- Ceκa + De-κa = Eeika continuity of ψ\nκ(Ceκa - De-κa) = ikEeika continuity of dψ\n-\ndx\n5) From question 4), we see that we end up with a system of 4 equations for\n5 unknown. But what we are interested in, is the amount of transmitted wave\n(in region (III)) with respect to the incoming wave (in region (I)). So what we\n\nR\ncan do is to divide the four equations of the system by the constant in front\nof the incoming wave eikx in region (I). That way we will define the reflection\ncoefficiant r as being the ratio between the coefficiant in front of the reflected\nwave e-ikx in region (I) and the coefficiant in front of the incoming wave eikx\nin region (I). Similarly, we will define the transmission coefficiant t, as being\nthe ratio between the coefficiant in front of the transmitted wave eikx in region\n(III) and the coefficiant in front of the incoming wave eikx in region (I). Using\nthose notation re-write the system of 4 equations for the 4 unknown ratios.\nsolution:\nIntroducing the notation r = B , t = E , α = C and β = D , we see that the\nA\nA\nA\nA\nfour continuity conditions can be simplified to the following system of equations:\n1 + r = α + β\n-\n- ik(1 - r) = κ(α - β)\nαeκa + βe-κa = teika\n-\n- κ(αeκa - βe-κa) = ikteika\n6) From the system of 4 equations in question 5), we can solve for t and find\nthe following result:\n|t|2(E) =\nV 2\n1 p\n2m\n1+ 4E(V0\n-E) sinh2(a\nh2 (V0-E))\n\nWhat we want to calculate now is the transmitted current density with respect\nto the incoming density. The classical expression for the current density of\na single electron is: j = -ev, where -e is the charge of the electron and v is its\nvelocity. Can you express j in terms of the momentum p? From that expression,\nexpress the quantum equivalent of the current density, i.e the quantum current\ndensity operator. Finally calculate the ratio h\nh\nj\nj\nt\nii\ni between the expectation value\nof the quantum current density operator in region (III) and the expectation\nvalue of the quantum current density operator in region (I) (for the incoming\nwave only!).\nRemark: if you feel unconfortable with the normalization of the transmitted\nwave eikx (because you don't know what the boundaries of the integral are), it\ndoesn't matter, because in this case you are interested in the ratio of two current\ndensities that will each contain an integral of a complex exponential, and those\ntwo integrals will cancel out.\nsolution:\nIn classical mechanics, the current dnsity for one electron is: j = -ev =\ne p. To find the corresponding quantum operator, all we have to do is substi\nm\n-\nh d\ntute p for i dx . The quantum current density operator is then:\nˆ\neh\nd\nieh d\n=\nj = - mi dx\nm dx\nThe ration between the expectation value of the quantum current density\noperator in region (III) and the expectation value of the quantum current density\noperator in region (I) is given by:\nt∗e-ikx ie\nikx\nhjti\nR\nh\nd (te\n)dx\n=\nm dx\ne-ikx ie\nd\n= |t|\nhjii\nm\nh\ndx (eikx)dx\n\n1.3\nPhysical discussion\n7) In question 6), we have been expressing the expectation value of the current\ndensity operator when the electron is described by a wavefunction ψ correspond\ning to eigenenergy E. As I explained in the first section of this problem, in a\nmetal, all the eigenenergies E up to the Fermi energy EF are occupied by two\nelectrons. If the two metals (on both side of the vacuum region) have the same\nvalue for EF , what do you think will be the \"net\" current tunneling through\nthe vacuum region? Explain your answer.\nsolution:\nFrom question 6), we conclude that the probability that an electron tunnel\nthrough the vacuum layer is given by |t|2(E) (for a given energy E between\n0 and V0). Up to now, we have been discussing an electron coming from the\nleft hand side and tunneling towards the right hand side. But because of the\nsymmetry of the problem, we see that an electron coming from the right hand\nside can also tunnel towards the left hand side, with the exact same probability.\nSince the Fermi energy indicates the highest energy state occupied in the metal,\nwe see that if the two metals have the same Fermi energy, then the \"net current\"\ngoing through the vacuum layer is zero. Indeed, an electron coming from the\nleft hand side with an energy E is \"canceled out\" by an electron coming from\nthe right hand side with the same energy E.\n8) From question 7), we see that in order to break the symmetry of the\nproblem and create a net current from the tip towards the surface, we need\nto introduce a bias. This is achieved by connecting the two pieces of metal to\na generator that will introduce a little potential difference V between the two\nmetals. If one wants a net flow of electrons from the left to the right, can you\nshow on a diagram what the shift in the Fermi energies of the two metals should\nbe?\nRemark: In a given potential configuration, an electron always goes where\nthe potential is smaller in order to minimize its total energy.\nsolution:\nFrom what has been explained in question 7), we see that in order to get\na \"net current\" flowing from the left to the right, we need to raise the Fermi\nenergy in the tip (the metal on the left hand side), and lower the Fermi energy\nat the surface (the metal on the right hand side). To achieved this, we connect\nthe two metals to a generator and apply a bias V . Everything is indicated on\nfigure 2.\n9) Now let us imagine that the bias between the two metals is really small. If\nthis is the case then most of the net current result from the motion of electrons\nfrom the left to the right with an energy corresponding to the Fermi energy\nE = EF . Let us introduce φ = V0 - EF . φ is called the \"work function\" of the\nmetal. Can you simplify the expression obtained in question 6) (at E = EF )\nwhen the argument of the sinh is big (Remember that sinh(x) ≈ e x when\nx >> 0)? Give a result in terms of φ, EF , V0, a and fondamental constants like\n\nIn this simplified expression, what is the caracteristic decay length\nh, and m.\nof the current density? For a (100) surface of Aluminum, the work function is\nφ ≈ 4.20eV. Can you give an estimate for the caracteristic decay length? From\nthis value, conclude about the capability of an STM device to image a surface\nup to atomic dimensions.\nsolution:\n\np\na\nV(x)\nV0\nx\nmetal\nvacuum\nmetal\nEF + V/2\nEF -V/2\n(I)\n(II)\n(III)\n\nFigure 2: In order to have a net flow of electron from the left to the right, we\napply a bias between the two metals. The Fermi energy is raised on the left\nhand side by V/2 and lowered on the right hand side by V/2, where V is the\napplied bias.\ne\nReplacing E by EF in the expression for |t|2 and expanding the sinh(x) in\nx , we find that:\n2mφ\nh2\n16φ e-2a\n|t|\nV\n≈\nFrom this expression, we see that the caracteristic decay length is l =\np1\n.\n2mφ\nFor the (100) surface of Aluminum, we end up with: l ≈ 0.47 A. From\nh\nthis value we can safely conclude that an STM device is more than capable of\nimaging a surface up to atomic dimensions.\n10) From question 9) we come to the conclusion that, when a small bias exists\nbetween the two metals, the current density is exponentially depending on the\ndistance a between the two metals and so the device (the STM) is extremely\nsensitive to the distance between the tip and the metal surface. From there, can\nyou think of a measurement setup that would allow us to image the surface?\nsolution:\nA practical measurement setup would be to use an electronic system (a\nfeedback loop) that would monitor in live the current and act on the tip (i.e\nraising or lowering the tip) in order to keep the current constant. That way\nsomeone would image the surface by following the z coordinate of the tip with\nrespect to displacement in x and y directions."

To do this we will use the quadratic approximation to express the\npotential energy of the crystal. Atomic positions at equilibrium are represented\nby the following vectors:\nR~ uv = a(u~ex + v~ey)\nwhere a is the lattice spacing. Instantaneous atomic displacements with respect\nto their equilibrium position are represented by the following vectors:\n~τuv = xuv~ex + yuv~ey\nwhere u and v are integers.\nIn a 2D square lattice, each atom (u, v) has 4 nearest neighbours: (u - 1, v),\n(u +1, v), (u, v - 1) and (u, v +1). In our model we will consider that each bond\nbetween two nearest neighbours has a certain energy. This energy is divided into\ntwo contributions. The first one is a compression/elongation contribution\narising only when atoms are moving in the same direction which is the bond\ndirection. We model this by a spring of constant k. The second contribution is a\nshearing contribution arising only when one of the atom moves perpendicular\nto the other. We model this by a spring of constant g. The total potential energy\nof the crystal is a sum over an infinite number of pairs of atoms, but the only\nones where the atomic displacement of atom (u, v) appear are the following:\nV (..., xuv, yuv, ...) = ... +\n1 k(xu+1v - xuv)2 + 1 k(xuv - xu-1v)2 + 1 k(yuv+1 - yuv )2 + 1 k(yuv - yuv-1)2 +\n\n1 g(xuv+1 - xuv)2 + 1 g(xuv - xuv-1)2 + 1 g(yu+1v - yuv)2 + 1 g(yuv - yu-1v)2 +\n...\nNicolas Poilvert & Nicola Marzari\n\nThe first four terms are the \"compression/elongation\" terms and the last four\nones are the \"shearing\" terms. For example if one looks at 1\n2 g(xuv - xuv-1)2 ,\none sees that when atoms (u, v - 1) and (u, v) are displaced by respectively\nxuv-1 and xuv in the x direction, then the relative displacement between the\ntwo atoms is xuv - xuv-1. And since this relative displacement is orthogonal\nto the bond direction (which is in the y direction) then a shearing energy of\n1 g(xuv - xuv-1)2 is associated with it.\n1) Write down Newton's equations for atom (u, v) given the expression for\nthe total energy of the lattice given above. The atoms have the same mass\ndenoted by m.\n2) By using the ansatz:\n~τuv = (x0~ex + y0~ey)ei(kxua+ky va-ωt)\ntransform Newton's equations into a 2 dimensional linear system of equations.\n3) Find the dispersion relations ω(kx, ky). Define the first Brillouin zone\nfor this crystal, i.e the smallest k-space unit cell that uniquely defines all the\npossible phonon frequencies ω(kx, ky).\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance\nIn NMR experiments one can actually image a body by looking at resonance\npeaks in the radio frequency domain corresponding to photon emission as a\nresponse to a previous magnetic exitation. In this problem we would like to\nfocus on the physics of this resonance and find a quantum description for it. This\nwill be an occasion for us to solve the time-dependant Schrodinger equation.\nThe principle of an NMR experiment is to look at the phenomenon of nuclear\nspin flip. To induce such a flip one uses a big homogenous magnetic field in\nthe z direction and a small magnetic field rotating in the xy plane. Nuclei (and\nelectrons) are like little magnets, they carry an intrinsic magnetic moment which\nhas the property to be proportional to the spin, i.e ~μ = γS~ˆ. The total energy\nof a magnet in a magnetic field B~ reduces to the magnetic interaction of the\nmagnet with the field:\nμ. B = -γS. B~\nEtot = -~ ~\n~ˆ\nOne describes the quantum state of the magnet by a 2 dimensional vector\n|ψ(t)i =\na\nb(\n(\nt\nt\n)\n)\n, where a(t) and b(t) are time dependant complex numbers.\nThis description is nothing but the description of the spin quantum state of a\nspin one-half particle like the electron or the proton. Indeed since the mag\nnetic moment is proportional to the spin, what we are actually looking at is the\ndynamics of the spin induced by the magnetic field B~.\n1) In homework two we saw what the y projection of the spin operator was.\nNow we need the entire description of the spin operator. Here it is:\n⎛\n⎞\nSˆx\nS~ˆ = ⎝ Sˆy ⎠ = Sˆx~ex + Sˆy~ey + Sˆz~ez\nSˆz\n\n!\n\np\nThe projections are operators themselves and the expression for those operators\nin the orthonormal basis of the eigenvectors of Sˆz , denoted by {|+i , |-i}, is:\nSˆx = h\nˆ\nh\n0 -i\nSy = 2\ni\nSˆz\nh\n=\n0 -1\nFrom the expression for the spin operator and the total energy of the magnet\nin a B~ field, write down the time-dependant Schrodinger equation for the spin\nstate |ψi =\na\nb(\n(\nt\nt\n)\n)\n. The magnetic field consists of the superposition of a\nhomogeneous magnetic field in the z direction B~0 = B0~ez and a rotating field\nB~1 = B1(cos(ω1t)~ex + sin(ω1t)~ey) in the xy plane.\n2) In order to simplify the resolution of this equation in a(t) and b(t), we\nwill use the following ansatz for |ψ(t)i:\n|ψ(t)i =\nd\nc\n(\n(\nt\nt\n)\n)\ne\ne\n-\ni\ni\nγB0t\nγB0t\nUsing this ansatz re-write the Schrodinger equation in terms of c(t) and d(t).\nTo do this, express the left-hand side of the Schrodinger equation i h d|ψ\ndt\n(t)i in\nterms of c(t) and d(t). Then express the right-hand side by replacing a(t) and\nb(t) by respectively c(t)ei γB0t and d(t)e-i γB0t . Simplify as much as you can the\nterms remembering that cos(x) + i sin(x) = eix and cos(x) - i sin(x) = e-ix .\nThe final equations in c(t) and d(t) should be simple.\n3) The solution for those equations, given that at t = 0 we consider that\n|ψ(0)i = |+i =\n, are:\n\n(ω\niω+t\niω- t)\n!\nc(t)\n=\nω--ω+\n)t\n-e\n- ω+e\n2e-i(ω++ω-\niω+t\niω\nd(t)\nγB1(ω--ω+) ω+ω-(e\n- e\n-t)\nwhere ω± = - 1\n2 (γB0 + ω1 ±\n(γB0 + ω1)2 + (γB1)2). Given this, write down\nthe quantum state of the system at any time t.\n4) What we are interested in is the probability that at time t the system\nhas \"flipped\" to a spin down state from the spin up state at time t = 0. Given\nthe full expression of |ψ(t)i of question 3), calculate this transition probability\nP\n(t) to measure the system in a \"spin down\" state at time t. Give your\n|+i→|-i\nanswer in terms of γ, B0, B1, ω1 and t.\n5) From question 4), calculate the maximum value for the transition prob\nability. Plot the maximum probability as a function of ω1 considering that ω1\ncan take positive and negative values (this relates to the fact that B~1 can ro\ntate clockwise or anti-clockwise in the xy plane). What is the width at half\nmaximum Δω?\n6) What is the limit of Δω when the amplitude of the rotating magnetic\nfield B1 is going to zero? What can you conclude from that?\n\ndiscussion: In an hospital, one can use an NMR system to image the brain\nof a patient for example. To do this, superconducting coils are used to create\nan inhomogeneous B~0 field. Then a rotating field B~1 is created with a definite\nfrequency ω1. Now since the resonance frequency is given by γ||B~0|| and the\nsharpness of the resonance is given by 2γB1, one can see that if B1 is really small,\nthen only areas of the brain where the local field B~0 is such that γ||B~0|| = ω1 will\nabsorb and emit radio photons. If we somehow have a way to determine from\nwhat points in space the emitted photons originated, then we have a device that\nis capable of precisely imaging areas of the brain that have the same chemical\nand magnetic environment."

For example if one looks at 1 g(xuv - xuv-1)2 ,\none sees that when atoms (u, v - 1) and (u, v) are displaced by respectively\nxuv-1 and xuv in the x direction, then the relative displacement between the\ntwo atoms is xuv - xuv-1. And since this relative displacement is orthogonal\n\nP\nto the bond direction (which is in the y direction) then a shearing energy of\n1 g(xuv - xuv-1)2 is associated with it.\n1) Write down Newton's equations for atom (u, v) given the expression for\nthe total energy of the lattice given above. The atoms have the same mass\ndenoted by m.\nsolution:\nTo obtain Newton's equations, we can use the Lagrange formalism, which\nenables us not to worry about the sign of forces. The Lagrange equation for the\nx component of atom (u, v) is:\nd ( ∂L ) = ∂L\ndt ∂x uv\n∂xuv\nThe Lagrangian of the system can be written as: L({xuv , yuv}, {x uv, y uv}, t) =\n( 1 mx 2 + 1 my 2 ) - V ({xuv, yuv }), and if we plug this expression in the\nuv\nuv\nuv\nLagrange equation for xuv, we can deduce the equation of motion:\nd2\nm\nxuv = k(xu+1v + xu-1v - 2xuv) + g(xuv+1 + xuv-1 - 2xuv )\ndt2\nThe same kind of steps leads us to the equation of motion for yuv:\nd2\nm\nyuv = k(yuv+1 + yuv-1 - 2yuv) + g(yu+1v + yu-1v - 2yuv )\ndt2\n2) By using the ansatz:\n~τuv = (x0~ex + y0~ey)ei(kxua+ky va-ωt)\ntransform Newton's equations into a 2 dimensional linear system of equations.\nsolution:\nFrom the ansatz, we can deduce an expression for xuv(t) and yuv(t):\nxuv(t) = ~τuv · ~ex = x0ei(kx ua+ky va-ωt)\nand\nyuv(t) = ~τuv · ~ey = y0ei(kxua+ky va-ωt)\nPlugging those equations inside the equations of motion of question 1), we find:\n-mω2x0 = k(x0eikxa + x0e-ikxa - 2x0) + g(x0eiky a + x0e-iky a - 2x0)\nand\n-mω2y0 = k(y0eiky a + y0e-iky a - 2y0) + g(y0eikxa + y0e-ikxa - 2y0)\n3) Find the dispersion relations ω(kx, ky). Define the first Brillouin zone\nfor this crystal, i.e the smallest k-space unit cell that uniquely defines all the\npossible phonon frequencies ω(kx, ky).\nsolution:\nThe equations in question 2) are already decoupled for x0 and y0, so simpli\nfying those equations by x0 and y0, gives us two dispersion relations:\nω2 = 4\nm\nk sin2(kx a\n2 ) + 4\nm\ng sin2(ky a\n2 )\nand\nω2 = 4\nm\nk sin2(ky a\n2 ) + 4\nm\ng sin2(kx a\n2 )\n\nFigure 2: To plot the dispersions, i chose a = 1, 4\nm\nk = 1 and 4\nm\ng = 1/2\nFrom the dispersion formula, we see that the periodicity in x and y is the\nsame and is given by 2\na\nπ . We can then obtain all the possible distinct phonon\nfrequencies by restricting ourselves inside a square of side 2\na\nπ in reciprocal space.\nWe will consider kx and ky to vary between - π and π . A sketch of the two\na\na\nphonon dispersions is shown on figure 2.\ndiscussion:\nWe see that the first dispersion formula is linked to a motion of the atoms\nin the x direction only. The corresponding phonons are then called longitudinal\nphonons. The other dispersion formula has to do with motion in the y direction.\nThe corresponding phonons are then called transverse phonons. But both types\nof phonons are acoustical, because ω goes to zero when ~k goes to ~0. There are\nno optical phonons because there is only one atom in the smallest possible unit\ncell.\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance\nIn NMR experiments one can actually image a body by looking at resonance\npeaks in the radio frequency domain corresponding to photon emission as a\nresponse to a previous magnetic exitation. In this problem we would like to\nfocus on the physics of this resonance and find a quantum description for it.

The magnetic field consists of the superposition of a\nhomogeneous magnetic field in the z direction B~0 = B0~ez and a rotating field\nB~1 = B1(cos(ω1t)~ex + sin(ω1t)~ey) in the xy plane.\nsolution:\nThe total energy for the magnet is given by : -~μ. B~. Going from a classical\nto a quantum description, we find that the Hamiltonian of our system is :\n-γ~ˆ\n+ ˆ\n+ ˆ\nS. B~ = -γ(SˆxBx\nSyBy\nSz Bz ). We can then deduce the time-dependant\nSchrodinger equation for this system :\ni h d|ψ\ndt\n(t)i = -γ(SˆxBx + SˆyBy + SˆzBz ) |ψ(t)i\nIn this equation |ψ(t)i is a 2 dimensional spin state, Sˆx, Sˆy and Sˆz are the spin\noperators and Bx, By and Bz are the projections of the magnetic field along\nthe x, y and z directions. Those projections are numbers not operators!\nNow if we plug in the values for the spin operators and the components of\nthe magnetic field, we find:\n\n|\n\n!\n\n!\n\np\n\n!\n\nda(t)\niγ\nB0\nB1e-iω1 t\na(t)\ndt\n=\ndb(t)\nB1eiω1t\n-B0\nb(t)\ndt\n2) In order to simplify the resolution of this equation in a(t) and b(t), we\nwill use the following ansatz for ψ(t)i:\n|ψ(t)i =\nd\nc\n(\n(\nt\nt\n)\n)\ne\ne\n-\ni\ni\nγB0t\nγB0t\nUsing this ansatz re-write the Schrodinger equation in terms of c(t) and d(t).\nTo do this, express the left-hand side of the Schrodinger equation i h d|ψ\ndt\n(t)i in\nterms of c(t) and d(t). Then express the right-hand side by replacing a(t) and\nb(t) by respectively c(t)ei γB\n0t and d(t)e-i γB\n0t . Simplify as much as you can the\nterms remembering that cos(x) + i sin(x) = eix and cos(x) - i sin(x) = e-ix .\nThe final equations in c(t) and d(t) should be simple.\nsolution:\nIf one follows all the steps outlined above, one finds the following system of\nequations for c(t) and d(t):\ndc(t)\ne-i(ω1 +γB0)td(t)\ndt\niγB1\n=\ndd(t)\nei(ω1+γB0)tc(t)\ndt\n3) The solution for those equations, given that at t = 0 we consider that\n|ψ(0)i = |+i =\n, are:\n\niω+t\niω\n!\nc(t)\nω--ω+ (ω-e\n- ω+e\n- t)\nd(t)\n=\n2e-i(ω++ω-)t ω+ω (eiω+t\niω-t)\nγB1(ω--ω+)\n-\n- e\nwhere ω± = - 2\n1 (γB0 + ω1 ±\n(γB0 + ω1)2 + (γB1)2). Given this, write down\nthe quantum state of the system at any time t.\nsolution:\nThe quantum state is given by the following ket:\n⎛\n⎞\niγB0t/2\nψ(t)i = ⎝\ne\nω--ω+ (ω-eiω+t - ω+eiω- t)\n⎠\nγB0\n2e i(ω1+\n)t\n|\nγB1(ω--ω+) ω+ω (eiω+t - eiω-t)\n-\n4) What we are interested in is the probability that at time t the system\nhas \"flipped\" to a spin down state from the spin up state at time t = 0. Given\nthe full expression of |ψ(t)i of question 3), calculate this transition probability\nP\n(t) to measure the system in a \"spin down\" state at time t. Give your\n|+i→|-i\nanswer in terms of γ, B0, B1, ω1 and t.\nsolution:\nIn this question, we apply one of the postulates of quantum mechanics: the\nprobability to measure the system in a \"spin down\" state at time t is given by\nthe following projection:\nP|+i→|-i(t) = |h-|ψ(t)i| 2\nGiven the full expression for |ψ(t)i, we see that the probability is the following:\n\np\n(t) =\n-t)\nγB0\n2e i(ω1+\n)t\niω+t\niω\n(e\nP\nω+ω\n- e\n|+i→|-i\n-\nγB1(ω--ω+)\nBy plugging in the values for ω+ and ω , we see that this probability can be\n-\nwritten as:\nP|+i→|-i\n(γB1 )2\n(t) = (ω1+γB0)2+(γB1)2 sin2( (ω1 + γB0)2 + (γB1)2\nt )\n5) From question 4), calculate the maximum value for the transition prob\nability. Plot the maximum probability as a function of ω1 considering that ω1\ncan take positive and negative values (this relates to the fact that B~1 can ro\ntate clockwise or anti-clockwise in the xy plane). What is the width at half\nmaximum Δω?\nsolution:\nFrom the solution in question 4), we see that the maximum probability is\nthis:\n(γB1)2\nPmax = (ω1+γB0)2 +(γB1 )2\nThe width at half maximum is a measure of how \"sharp\" the maximum prob\nability peaks around its maximum value. To obtain it one has to solve the\nfollowing equation : Pmax(ω1) = 1\n2 (Pmax)max = 2\n1 for ω1, and then calculate\nthe \"distance\" between the two solutions of this equation. When one does that,\none finds: Δω = 2γB1. A plot of the maximum probability is shown on figure\n3.\nFigure 3: Plot of the maximum probability of transition between state |+i and\nstate |-i with respect to the excitation frequency ω1. One can see that when B1\ngoes to zero, this probability is sharply peaked around a resonance frequency\nω0 = -γB0. To obtain this plot i used -γB0 = 1 and -γB1 = 1/10.\n\n6) What is the limit of Δω when the amplitude of the rotating magnetic\nfield B1 is going to zero? What can you conclude from that?\nsolution:\nFrom question 5), we see that the \"width\" of the peak is proportional to\nΔω = 2γB1. So when B1 goes to zero (without being actually zero!), the\nmaximum probability has a value close to one only for a very small window\naround the resonance frequency. So an NMR device is an extremely sensitive\ninstrument.\ndiscussion: In an hospital, one can use an NMR system to image the brain\nof a patient for example. To do this, superconducting coils are used to create\nan inhomogeneous B~0 field. Then a rotating field B~1 is created with a definite\nfrequency ω1. Now since the resonance frequency is given by γ||B~0|| and the\nsharpness of the resonance is given by 2γB1, one can see that if B1 is really small,\nthen only areas of the brain where the local field B~0 is such that γ||B~0|| = ω1 will\nabsorb and emit radio photons. If we somehow have a way to determine from\nwhat points in space the emitted photons originated, then we have a device that\nis capable of precisely imaging areas of the brain that have the same chemical\nand magnetic environment."

The infinitesimal surface ele\nment is dS and V is the volume of the 3D crystal. The 2D equivalent is the\nfollowing:\nR\ng(E) =\nA\ndl\nfor the 2D case\n(2π)2\nE(~k)=E k~\nE(~k)k\nr~k\nwhere the integral is carried out over the \"isosurface\" of energy E, i.e the curve\ndefined by the equation E(kx, ky ) = E. The infinitesimal element of length along\nthe isosurface is dl and A is the area of the 2D crystal. Finally for the 1D case\nwe have:\ng(E) = (2\nL\nπ)\nk0 |\n(\nk=k0)| for the 1D case\ndE(k)\ndk\nwhere k0 are all the k points such that E(k0) = E, and L is the length of the\n1D crystal.\n1.1\nFree electron gas in 1D, 2D and 3D\nNow we will apply this to the 1D, 2D and 3D free electron gas.\n1) Write down the dispersion relations E(~k) for a free electron gas in 1D, 2D\nand 3D. From those relations, describe the corresponding isosurfaces, i.e draw\na typical isosurface for each case (1D, 2D, 3D).\n2) For the 2D and 3D cases, find the appropriate set of coordinates to de\nscribe an isosurface. Using this set of coordinates, give a mathematical expres\nsion for the \"surface\" element dS.

Plot\nthis density of states as a function of the energy in the appropriate interval\n(defined in question 1)).\nTight-binding method\n2.1\ngeometrical description of the crystal\nLet us consider a simple cubic lattice (3D) of lattice parameter a, with one atom\nper unit cell centered at the origin of the coordinate system. Each atom has\none valence electron and in the atomic limit (i.e in the limit where the atoms\nare far from each other) this electron is described by an s-type atomic orbital\nφs(~r).\n1) Give a mathematical expression for the primitive basis vectors ~a1,~a2,~a3\nthat describe this simple cubic lattice. Calculate the expression for the recipro\ncal primitive vectors ~b1,~b2,~b3.

Relate those two volumes by an equation.\n2) Express the equilibrium position vectors R~ for the atoms in this simple\ncubic crystal in terms of the ~a1,~a2,~a3 basis. Sketch the first Brillouin Zone in\nreciprocal space.\n2.2\ncalculation of the band dispersion\nThe tight-binding method is an extension of the LCAO method, used in Chem\nistry, to periodic systems like solids. The spirit of the technique is the following:\nIf one looks at the wavefunction for an electron in the atomic limit (when the\natoms of the solid are far from each other), then this wavefunction looks very\nmuch like the atomic orbital φs(~r). Now if we bring the atoms closer and closer\nto each other, the wavefunction for the electron will be perturbed and at suffi\nciently small distances between atoms, the electron will be able to \"hop\" from\natom to atom, and it will delocalize over the entire solid. Nevertheless when\nthe electron is localized around one particular atom, let say the atom centered\naround position R~, the wavefunction must still look very much like φs(~r - R~).\nSo the idea of the tight-binding method is to write down the electronic wave-\nfunction as a linear combinaison of all the atomic orbitals φs(~r - R~), centered\naround each atom R~ in the crystal (the summation over R~ below concerns all\natoms in the crystal):\nψs(~r) =\n~ c ~φs(~r - R~)\nR\nR\n\ni\ni\n\nR\nR\n\nD\nE\n|\nD\nE\nP\nR\nR\nR\nD\nE\nBut in order to be an \"acceptable\" wavefunction, ψs(~r) must satisfy Bloch's\ntheorem. This is a big constraint for ψs(~r), and as a consequence, we can write\ndown an expression for ψs(~r) for each wavevector ~k:\nψ s~k(~r) = √1\nN\nP\nR~ ei~kR~φs(~r - R~)\nThe √1\nN is just a normalization factor (N being the number of unit cells in our\ncrystal), and the coefficiants cR~ are given by ei~kR~.\nWe are interested in the eigenenergy Es(~k) of the periodic one-electron effec\ntive hamiltonian Hˆ . To calculate this eigenenergy we use the following result:\n|Hˆ |ψ\n(~k) = hψ\nhψ\n~k\ns\n~k\ns\nEs\n|ψ\n~k\ns\n~k\ns\n1) Give the mathematical expression for ψ s~k|ψ s~k in terms of integrals over\nthe volume of the crystal. In this expression you should obtain terms of the\nform:\ncrystal φ∗\ns (~r - R~)φs(~r - R~0)d~r\nBecause of the Born-Von Karman boundary conditions, one can show that this\nintegral is equal to the following one:\ncrystal φ∗\ns (~r)φs(~r - (R~0 - R~))d~r\nSo you see that this integral only depends on the relative distance R~0 - R~.\nUsing this, simplify the expression for ψ ~ ψ ~ ?

The infinitesimal surface ele\nment is dS and V is the volume of the 3D crystal. The 2D equivalent is the\nfollowing:\nA\ndl\ng(E) = (2π)2\nE(~k)=E kr\n~ ~k E(~k)k for the 2D case\nwhere the integral is carried out over the \"isosurface\" of energy E, i.e the curve\ndefined by the equation E(kx, ky ) = E. The infinitesimal element of length along\nthe isosurface is dl and A is the area of the 2D crystal. Finally for the 1D case\nwe have:\ng(E) = (2\nL\nπ)\nk0\n(\nk=k0)| for the 1D case\ndE(k)\ndk\n|\nwhere k0 are all the k points such that E(k0) = E, and L is the length of the\n1D crystal.\nRemark: in this exercise we are interested in the energy density of\nstates without taking into account the spin degeneracy! If we were\ninterested in the FULL density of states, we would have to multiply\nall our results by 2.\n1.1\nFree electron gas in 1D, 2D and 3D\nNow we will apply this to the 1D, 2D and 3D free electron gas.\n1) Write down the dispersion relations E(~k) for a free electron gas in 1D, 2D\nand 3D. From those relations, describe the corresponding isosurfaces, i.e draw\na typical isosurface for each case (1D, 2D, 3D).\nsolution:\nThe dispersion relations are the following:\nNicolas Poilvert & Nicola Marzari\n\nq\nq\nx\nE(kx) = h 2 k2\nin 1D\n2m\nx\ny\nE(kx, ky) =\nh 2 (k\nm\n+k2 ) in 2D\nand\nh 2(k2 +k2 +k2 )\nx\ny\nz\nE(kx, ky, kz) =\n2m\nin 3D\nOne can visualize the 1D and 2D dispersion by looking at the plots shown on\nfigure 1. The isosurfaces are the regions of space where the energy is kept\nFigure 1: 1D and 2D energy dispersions for a free electron\nconstant. As a consequence, we have the following results:\nh 2k2\nx\n1. In the 1D case, the isosurface is defined by the equation\n2m = E, so\nwe see that this isosurface reduces to two points, k0 and -k0, where\n=\n2mE\nk0\nh2\n\nx\ny )\n2. In the 2D case, the isosurface is defined by\nh2(k\nm\n+k2\n= E. This equation\nis nothing but the equation of a circle in kx, ky space of radius R =\n2mE\nh2 .\n\n3. In the 3D case, the equation that defines the isosurface is the following:\nx\ny\nz\nh 2(k2 +k2 +k2 ) = E. So we see that we define a sphere in the kx, ky, kz\n2m\nq\nspace with a radius R =\n2mE .\nh 2\n2) For the 2D and 3D cases, find the appropriate set of coordinates to de\nscribe an isosurface. Using this set of coordinates, give a mathematical expres\nsion for the \"surface\" element dS. Finally give an analytical form for the density\nof states.\nsolution:\nGiven the geometry of the isosurfaces in 2D and 3D, we see that the appro\npriate sets of coordinates are the following:\n- In the 2D case, we will use a set of planar polar coordinates r, θ (r2 =\nk2 + k2, tan(θ) = ky ). The \"element of length\" along the circle of radius\nx\ny\nkx\nr is dl = rdθ.\n\nq\nq\nq\nq\nP\np\n- In the 3D case, we will use the natural extension of the planar polar\ncoordinates to 3 variables, which is nothing less than the set of spherical\ncoordinates r, θ, φ (r2 = kx\n2 + ky\n2 + kz\n2, tan(φ) = ky , sin(θ) = kx ). The\nkx\nkz\n\"element of surface\" on a sphere of radius r is dS = r2 sin(θ)dθdφ.\nLet us now use the formulas given at the beginning of this exercise. For the 2D\ncase, we have: k~ E(~k)k = h 2\nk2 + k2 = h 2 r using the polar coordinates. We\nr~k\nm\nx\ny\nm\nq\nneed to integrate the inverse of k~ E(~k)k along the circle of radius r =\n2mE .\nr~k\nh 2\nSo the density of states in 2D is:\nR 2π\nA\nrdθ\nmA\ng2D(E) =\nh2\n=\n(2π)2\nr\n2πh 2\nm\nWe see an interesting feature of the 2D density of states for the free electron\ngas: it is a constant!\nLet us move on to the 3D case. This time the integral is carried out over\na sphere of radius r =\n2mE . We have k~ E(~\nh 2\nk2 + k2 + k2 = h 2 r\nh 2\nr~k\nk)k = m\nx\ny\nz\nm\nand so the density of states is:\nV\nR 2π R π r sin(θ)dθdφ\ng3D(E) = (2π)3\n\nh2 r\nm\nIn this integral the remaining r term is independant of θ and φ, because r =\n2mE . So the integral is just 4π and the final answer is:\nh 2\n(2\nV\nπ)2 ( 2\n\nm\ng3D(E) =\nh2 )3/2√\nE\n3) For the one dimensional case, use the third formula above to calculate the\ndensity of states.\nsolution:\nFor the 1D case, we use the formula given at the beginning of this exercise.\nWe see that there are 2 k0 for which the dispersion relation is verified in the\nexpression for the density of states g(E) = (2\nL\nπ)\nk0\ndE(k) (\nk=k0)| . The direct\ndk\nuse of this formula gives us:\n|\ng1D(E) = L\nm √1\nE\nπ\n2 h2\n4) Plot the 1D, 2D and 3D density of states as a function of the energy E.\nsolution:\nI give here the plots of\ng1D(E) ,\ng2D(E) and\ng3D\nh\n(\nE\n)\n)\n3/2 as a function of E\nL\nm\nmA\nV\nπ\n√\nh2\nh2\n(2π)2 ( 2m\n2π\n\non figure 2.\n1.2\nThe case of tightly bound electrons in 1D\nLet's consider tightly bound electrons described by the following band dispersion\n(for a 1D linear chain of atoms):\nE(k) = 0 - 2γ cos(ka)\n\np\n=\n=\np\nFigure 2: 1D, 2D and 3D normalized density of states for a free electron. The\n1D curve blows up when E\n0, the 2D one is constant, and the 3D grows\ncontinuously from 0.\n→\n1) Define the interval of all possible values for E(k) when k is in the first\nBrillouin Zone. Plot the band dispersion for k in the first Brillouin Zone.\nsolution:\nWe see on the band dispersion that the periodicity in k is given by the\ncosine term. This term is periodic in k with the following period 2\na\nπ . Moreover\nsince the cosine is an even function in k, it is convenient to represent the band\nstructure on a plot centered around k = 0, starting at k =\nπ\na and ending at\nπ\n-\nk = a . The band dispersion is shown on figure 3. In order to plot this\ndispersion i considered γ to be positive.\n2) Using the formula for the 1D case, calculate the density of states. Plot\nthis density of states as a function of the energy in the appropriate interval\n(defined in question 1)).\nsolution:\nGiven the mathematical expression for the band dispersion, we see that:\ndE\ndk\n(k) = 2γa sin(ka). In the formula given for the 1D case, we see that we need\nto calculate this derivative at points k0 such that E(k0) = E. Before to calculate\nk0, let's have a look at what is the energy range for E. We see that because the\ncosine takes values only between -1 and 1, then the energy E must be located\nbetween 0 - 2γ and 0 + 2γ. In this interval of energy, k0 can be expressed as\nk0 = ± a\n1 arccos( 0\n-\nγ\nE ).\nIf we go back to the expression for the derivative of E(k), and if we use the\nwell-known trigonometric formula sin(x) = ± 1 - cos2(x), then we see that:\ndE(k)\n|2γa sin(k0a)|\n|2γa±\n0 -E )2|\n|\ndk |k=k0\n1-(\n2γ\nWe can now express the density of states for a one dimensional nearest\nneighbour tight-binding as:\ng(E) =\nL p\n2πγa\n1-( 0 -E )2\n2γ\n\nFigure 3: Energy dispersion for a one dimensional nearest neighbour tight-\nbinding model. The first Brillouin Zone runs from k = - π\na to k = π\na . On this\nplot 0 is 1 and so is γ.\nA plot of this density of state is shown on figure 4.\nFigure 4: Density of state of a 1D nearest-neighbour tight-binding model.\n\n~\n\nTight-binding method\n2.1\ngeometrical description of the crystal\nLet us consider a simple cubic lattice (3D) of lattice parameter a, with one atom\nper unit cell centered at the origin of the coordinate system. Each atom has\none valence electron and in the atomic limit (i.e in the limit where the atoms\nare far from each other) this electron is described by an s-type atomic orbital\nφs(~r).\n1) Give a mathematical expression for the primitive basis vectors ~a1,~a2,~a3\nthat describe this simple cubic lattice. Calculate the expression for the recipro\ncal primitive vectors ~b1,~b2,~b3. What is the volume of the unit cell in real space?\nWhat is the volume of the unit cell in reciprocal space, i.e the first Brillouin\nZone? Relate those two volumes by an equation.\nsolution:\nThe simple cubic lattice is a Bravais lattice. As such all the lattice points\nare equivalent to each other. The most natural basis of primitive vectors are of\ncourse the cartesian vectors:\n~a1 = a~ex ~a2 = a~ey ~a3 = a~ez\nBy definition, the primitive vectors of the reciprocal lattice ~b1,~b2,~b3 are such\nthat: ~a1 · ~b1 = 2π, ~a2 · ~b1 = 0 and ~a3 · ~b1 = 0 (and equivalent expressions for\n~b2 and ~b3). For ~b1, we can easily conclude from the three relations above that\nthis vector must be perpendicular to ~a2 and ~a3. So in the case of the simple\ncubic lattice, this induces that this vector is perpendicular to ~ey and ~ez . So ~b1\nis a vector proportional to ~ex. Now if we use the fact that ~a1 · ~b1 = 2π, we can\nconclude that ~b1 = 2\na\nπ ~ex. The same kind of analysis for ~b2 and ~b3 leads us to\nthe following final expressions for the primitive vectors in reciprocal space:\n~b1 = 2\na\nπ ~ex ~b2 = 2\na\nπ ~ey ~b3 = 2\na\nπ ~ez\nThe volume of the unit cell in real space is given by the volume of the\nparallepiped delimited by ~a1, ~a2 and ~a3, which is nothing but Ω = ~a1 ·(~a2 ×~a3) =\na3 . The volume of the first Brillouin Zone is nothing but the volume of the unit\ncell in reciprocal space. Similarly to the real space case, this volume is given by\nΩ\nΩ\n0 = ~b1 · (~b2 × b3) = (2\na\nπ\n)3 . We see that the relationship between the volume of\nthe unit cell in real space Ω and the volume of the unit cell in reciprocal space\n0 is :\nΩ\n(2π)3\n=\nΩ\nThis relationship is valid for ANY crystal structure.\n2) Express the equilibrium position vectors R~ for the atoms in this simple\ncubic crystal in terms of the ~a1,~a2,~a3 basis. Sketch the first Brillouin Zone in\nreciprocal space.\nsolution:\nThe direct space translation vectors R~ are given by:\nR~ = n1~a1 + n2~a2 + n3~a3\nwhere n1, n2, n3 are integer numbers. The first Brillouin Zone centered on the\norigin of the coordinate system in reciprocal space is defined by all the possible\nk vectors ~k = k1 ~b1 + k2 ~b2 + k3 ~b3, where k1, k2, k3 are in the interval - 1 , 1 .\n\nP\ni\ni\n\nR\nR\n\nR\n2.2\ncalculation of the band dispersion\nThe tight-binding method is an extension of the LCAO method, used in Chem\nistry, to periodic systems like solids. The spirit of the technique is the following:\nIf one looks at the wavefunction for an electron in the atomic limit (when the\natoms of the solid are far from each other), then this wavefunction looks very\nmuch like the atomic orbital φs(~r). Now if we bring the atoms closer and closer\nto each other, the wavefunction for the electron will be perturbed and at suffi\nciently small distances between atoms, the electron will be able to \"hop\" from\natom to atom, and it will delocalize over the entire solid. Nevertheless when\nthe electron is localized around one particular atom, let say the atom centered\naround position R~, the wavefunction must still look very much like φs(~r - R~).\nSo the idea of the tight-binding method is to write down the electronic wave-\nfunction as a linear combinaison of all the atomic orbitals φs(~r - R~), centered\naround each atom R~ in the crystal (the summation over R~ below concerns all\natoms in the crystal):\nψs(~r) =\n~ c ~φs(~r - R~)\nR\nR\nBut in order to be an \"acceptable\" wavefunction, ψs(~r) must satisfy Bloch's\ntheorem. This is a big constraint for ψs(~r), and as a consequence, we can write\ndown an expression for ψs(~r) for each wavevector ~k:\nψ s~k(~r) = √1\nN\nP\nR~ ei~kR~φs(~r - R~)\nThe √1\nN is just a normalization factor (N being the number of unit cells in our\ncrystal), and the coefficiants cR~ are given by ei~kR~.\nWe are interested in the eigenenergy Es(~k) of the periodic one-electron effec\ntive hamiltonian Hˆ . To calculate this eigenenergy we use the following result:\n|Hˆ |ψ ~k\ns\n(~k) = hψ\nhψ\n~k\ns\nEs\n~k\ns |ψ ~k\ns\n1) Give the mathematical expression for ψ s~k|ψ s~k in terms of integrals over\nthe volume of the crystal. In this expression you should obtain terms of the\nform:\ncrystal φ∗\ns (~r - R~)φs(~r - R~0)d~r\nBecause of the Born-Von Karman boundary conditions, one can show that this\nintegral is equal to the following one:\ncrystal φ∗\ns (~r)φs(~r - (R~0 - R~))d~r\nSo you see that this integral only depends on the relative distance R~0 - R~.\nUsing this, simplify the expression for ψ ~ ψ ~ ? If the set of atomic orbitals\nn\no\nsk|\nsk\nφs(~r - R~)\nform an orthonormal basis, what is the mathematical expression\n\nR~\nfor ψ s~k|ψ s~k ?\nsolution:\n\nLet's write down the scalar product of ψ s~k(~r) with itself: ψ s~k|ψ s~k .\nψ s~k|ψ s~k = crystal ψs\n∗\n~k(~r)ψ s~k(~r)d~r\n\nP\nR\nR\n\nP\nR\n\nP\nR\n\nD\nE\nP\nR\nR\nR\nD\nE\nD\nE\nP\nBy plugging in the mathematical expression for ψ s~k(~r), this expression becomes:\nψ ~ ψ ~\n=\n~\ne\n(~r - R~)φs(~r - R~0)d~r\nsk|\nsk\nN\nR, R~0\ni~k(R~0-R~) crystal φ∗\ns\nAt this stage, we will use the hint given in the text above. Indeed if one considers\nthe integral crystal φ∗\ns (~r-R~)φs(~r-R~0)d~r, it is quite easy to see that translating\n~r by a direct space vector R~ does not change the value of the integral because\nof the Born-Von Karman boundary conditions on the solid. So we can simplify\nthe expression above to the following one:\nsk\nsk\nN\nR, R~0\ni~k(R~0-R~) crystal φ∗\ns\nψ ~|ψ ~\n=\n~\ne\n(~r)φs(~r - (R~0 - R~))d~r\nIt doesn't seem that we have achieved a lot here, but actually it is not true!\nIndeed if we change the summation variable from R~ and R~0 to R~ and R~00 =\nR~0 - R~, we see that the argument of the double sum does NOT depend on R~.\nThis means that the sum over R~ just gives us the total number of unit cell\nin the crystal, N, which cancels out with the 1 term. So in the end, we end up\n\nN\nwith the following expression for ψ s~k|ψ s~k :\nψ s~k|ψ s~k =\n~ ei~kR~00\ncrystal φs\n∗(~r)φs(~r - R~00)d~r\nR00\nMoreover if the basis of atomic orbitals is orthonormal then those integrals\nare all zero, exept the one for R~00 = ~0. And the final result is:\nψ s~k|ψ s~k = 1 if orthonormal atomic orbitals\nWe will now consider that the set of atomic orbitals form an or\nthonormal basis\n\n2) Now that we have expressed ψ ~ ψ ~ , we need to focus on the numer\nD\nE\nsk|\nsk\nator ψ s~k|Hˆ |ψ s~k . Because Hˆ is a periodic hamiltonian we can show that the\nnumerator can be written as:\nψ s~k|Hˆ |ψ s~k =\nR~ ei~kR~\ncrystal φs(~ Hφs(~r - R~)d~\nr) ˆ\nr\nLet us denote by s and γ the following integrals: s = crystal φs(~ Hφs r)d~r\nr) ˆ\n(~\nand γ = crystal φs(~ Hφs r- ~\nr (when ~\nr) ˆ\n(~\nR)d~\nR is a nearest-neighbour to the atom\ncentered around the origin ~0). Using those parameters, give a mathematical\nexpression for\nψ s~k|Hˆ |ψ s~k\nwhen one considers the sum over R~ only up to\nnearest neighbours.\nsolution:\nD\nE\nUsing the expression for ψ s~k|Hˆ |ψ s~k given above and the definition for the\nnearest-neighbour transfert integral, wee find the following result:\nψ s~k|Hˆ |ψ s~k = s +\nR~ ei~kR~γ\nwhere the sum runs over the nearest neighbours of the atom centered at the\norigin. Those nearest neighbours have the following coordinates R~ = ±~a1,\nR~ = ±~a2 and R~ = ±~a3.\n3) Using the results of question 1) and 2), plot the function Es(~k) along the\nfollowing lines in the first Brillouin Zone: from Γ ( 2\na\nπ (0, 0, 0)) to X ( 2\na\nπ (1, 0, 0)),\nthen from X to L ( 2\na\nπ (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)), and finally form L to Γ.\n\nsolution:\nFrom questions 1) and 2), we see that the energy dispersion can be written\nas:\nE(~k) = s + 2γ(cos(kxa) + cos(ky a) + cos(kza))\nWe can then plot this dispersion along high-symmetry lines. This plot is shown\non figure 5.\nFigure 5: Band structure of our 3D nearest-neighbour tight-binding model in a\nsimple cubic structure.\n4) Using a Taylor expansion for Es(~k) around ~k ≈ ~0, show that the band\ndispersion can be written as:\nEs(~k) ≈ α - h\nm\n~k\n∗\nand relate α and m∗ to the parameters s, γ and a. From that expression what\ncan you infer about the behavior of electrons with a wavevector close to the Γ\npoint? How does the effective mass m∗ vary with the \"hopping integral\" γ?\nsolution:\nUsing a Taylor expansion for the cosines around ~k ≈ 0, we find:\nE(~k) ≈ s + 2γ ∗ (1 - (kxa)2 + 1 - (ky a)2\n+ 1 - (kz a)2 ) = (s + 6γ) - a2γ~k2\nBy identification, we can extract the values for m∗ and α:\nα = s + 6γ and m∗ = 2\nh\na\n\nγ\nRemark: it is interesting and physically appealing that the effective\nmass is proportional to the INVERSE of the transfert integral γ.\nIndeed this coefficiant is a measure of how \"easy\" it is for an electron\nto \"hop\" from an atom to its nearest neighbour. It is then logical\nthat when γ is big, meaning that the electron easily transfer to a\nneighbouring atom, then the effective mass is small, such that this\n\nparticle is very \"light\". On the contrary, when γ is very small, then\nthe particle hardly moves away corresponding to the physical picture\nof a very \"heavy\" particle.\n5) If one considers that this crystal has only one valence electron per unit\ncell, will it be a metal or an insulator (explain your answer)? If this is a metal,\nwhat is the value of the Fermi energy? Show a 3D plot of the Fermi surface in\nthe first Brillouin Zone (kx, ky and kz all vary between - π and π ).\na\na\nsolution:\nWe saw in recitation, that a band can accomodate 2N electrons, where N is\nthe number of unit cell in the crystal and the coefficiant 2 takes nto account the\nspin degeneracy. In our case, we have one electron per unit cell, so N electrons\nin total and the band is half-filled. Our system is then a metal because empty\nenergy states are arbitrarily close to the highest occupied energy, the Fermi\nenergy. The Fermi energy is exactly the middle energy of our band because\nthis band is symmetric with respect to the middle energy. So EF = s. The\nFermi surface is defined to be the location of all the ~k vectors in the first\nBrillouin Zone, such that the energy E(~k) is equal to the Fermi energy. The\nequation that defines the Fermi surface is then:\nE(~k) = s + 2γ(cos(kxa) + cos(kya) + cos(kza)) = EF = s\nA 3D plot of the Fermi surface in the first Brillouin Zone is shown on figure 6.\nFigure 6: Fermi surface corresponding to a half-filled s band in a 3D simple\ncubic crystal in a nearest neighbour tight-binding model.\n\nR\nR\n~\nSi and GaAs\nSilicon and Gallium Arsenide crystals can be described by an fcc lattice with two\natoms per unit cell. The primitive vectors ~a1,~a2,~a3 for the fcc lattice expressed\nin a cartesian basis are given by:\na\na\na\n~a1 = 2 (0, 1, 1), ~a2 = 2 (1, 0, 1), and ~a3 = 2 (1, 1, 0)\na is the lattice parameter. The basis vectors, that describe the positions of\natoms inside a unit cell, are given by:\na\na\n~τ1 = 4 (1, 1, 1) and ~τ2 = - 4 (1, 1, 1)\n1) Find an expression for the reciprocal space primitive vectors ~b1,~b2,~b3.\nGive the expression for the Fourier coefficiant V ~ in terms of the periodic po-\nG\ntential V (~r). Establish a relationship between V G and V ~\n∗.\n- ~\nG\nsolution:\nIn general, the primitive basis vectors in reciprocal space are given by the\nfollowing formulas:\n~b1 = 2π\n~a2×~a3\n-\n~a1·(~a2×~a3)\n~b2 = 2π\n~a3×~a1\n-\n~\n(~a2×~a3)\na1·\n~b3 = 2π\n~a1×~a2\n-\n~a1·(~a2×~a3)\nCalculating those cross products gives us:\n~b1 = 2π (-1, 1, 1), ~b2 = 2π (1, -1, 1), ~b3 = 2π (1, 1, -1)\na\na\na\nWe have seen in the lectures on Bloch theorem (yes we saw it!), that the\nfourier coefficiants V ~ of the effective periodic potential V (~r) can be written as:\nG\nV ~ = 1\nr)e G·~rd~r\nG\nΩ\nR\nunit cell V (~\ni ~\nwhere Ω is the volume of the unit cell. Now let us take the complex conjuguate\nof V ~. We end up with:\nG\nG\nG\n(VG~)∗ = ( Ω\n1 R\nunit cell V (~r)ei ~·~rd~r)∗ = Ω\nR\nunit cell(V (~r)ei ~·~r)∗d~r\nBut since the potential is a real valued function, we see that V (~r)∗ = V (~r), and\nso we find:\n(V ~)∗ = 1\nr)ei ~·r)∗d~r = 1\nr)(ei ~·r)∗d~r = V\nG\nΩ unit cell(V (~\nG ~\nΩ unit cell V (~\nG ~\n-G~\n2) Does Silicon have an inversion symmetry, i.e V (-~r) = V (~r)? Explain\nyour answer. What about GaAs?\nsolution:\nThe origin of the coordinate system being in the middle of two nearest\nneighbour silicon atoms, we see that Silicon has an inversion symmetry. And so\nthe potential function must have this symmetry too, so V (~r) = V (-~r). GaAs\ndoes not have that symmetry because in the process of changing ~r to -~r, a\nGallium atom becomes an Arsenide atom.\n3) If a crystal have an inversion symmetry, show that V ~ = V - ~ = V ∗.\nG\nG\nG\nsolution:\nIf a crystal have an inversion symmetry, then because of question 1) and 2),\nwe see that:\n\nV G\n∗ = V - ~ = V ~\n~\nG\nG\nIndeed the first equality comes from question 1), and the second comes from\nP\ni ~\nthe identification of like terms in the two sums V (~r) =\n~ V ~e G~r = V (-~r) =\nP\ni ~\nG\nG\n~ V ~e G(-~r).\nG\nG"
