  "course_description": "This course surveys operations research models and techniques developed for a variety of problems arising in logistical planning of multi-echelon systems. There is a focus on planning models for production/inventory/distribution strategies in general multi-echelon multi-item systems. Topics include vehicle routing problems, dynamic lot sizing inventory models, stochastic and deterministic multi-echelon inventory systems, the bullwhip effect, pricing models, and integration problems arising in supply chain management. Probability and linear programming experience required.",

      "content": "Professor Simchi-Levi\n1.270J\nDistribution and Logistics\nPROJECT\nThe following case study concerns a retail company that has a central warehouse in the\nBoston area. This warehouse serves 24 retailers all located in that region. Our objective\nis to establish effective reorder intervals for a single product that accounts for more than\n80 percent of total sales. The company uses direct shipping strategy to distribute the\nproduct, i.e., each truck delivers items to one retailer per trip.\nTable 1 provides information on the warehouse and the 24 retailers served by it: the\nX and Y coordinates for each retailer and the warehouse, D, the demand rate per year\nfor the main product faced by each retailer, H, cost of holding an item per unit of time\n(year) at each retailer and at the warehouse.\nEach time the warehouse delivers items to a retailer there is an additional set-up\ncost proportional to the distance between the warehouse and that retailer. This cost is\napproximated by\nαdi + C\nwhere di is the distance between the warehouse and the retailer, α = 0.32 dollar per mile\nand C = 150$. Finally, every time the warehouse places an order, it pays a set up cost of\n400$.\n(i) Find an effective reorder interval for each retailer and the warehouse.\n(ii) Find the total cost associated with your distribution strategy.\n(iii) Show that your solution is within 6% from the optimal solution.\n(iv) Can you improve the solution?\n\nTable 1\nRetail\nX\nY\nHolding Cost\nDemand\nNo.\n$/item/year\nin a Year\n4.7\n3.9\n0.2\n5.6\n2.7\n0.9\n6.1\n4.3\n7.1\n7.9\n8.4\n2.4\n5.7\n6.1\n8.7\n6.2\n1.5\n4.6\n9.9\n4.3\n7.9\n2.9\n9.7\n2.5\n6.5\n1.5\n3.3\n5.8\n3.6\n9.1\n6.9\n0.6\n5.0\n0.5\n5.7\n6.8\n3.7\n8.0\n3.7\n5.6\n5.7\n4.7\n6.3\n3.2\n3.4\n4.4\n5.1\n3.8\n4.0\n6.0\nRetailer # 0 is the warehouse.\nThe coordinates are given in hundreds of miles.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nESD.273J / 1.270J Logistics and Supply Chain Management\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Simchi-Levi\n\nThe (s,S) Policy\n- (s, S) Policy: Whenever the inventory position\ndrops below a certain level, s, we order to\nraise the inventory position to level S.\n- The reorder point is a function of:\n- The Lead Time\n- Average demand\n- Demand variability\nDemand variability\n- Service level\n(c)Copyright 2002 D. Simchi-Levi\n\nNotation\n- AVG = average daily demand\n- STD = standard deviation of daily demand\n- LT = replenishment lead time in days\n- h = holding cost of one unit for one day\n- SL = service level (for example, 95%). This implies\nthat the probability of stocking out is 100%-SL (for\nexample, 5%)\n- Al\nAlso, th\nthe Inventtory PPositi\nition at any titime iis th\nthe\nactual inventory plus items already ordered, but not\nyet delivered\nyet delivered.\n(c)Copyright 2002 D. Simchi-Levi\n\nAnalysis\n- The reorder point has two components:\n- To account for average demand during lead time:\nLT×AVG\n- To account for deviations from average (we call this safety\nTo account for deviations from average (we call this safety\nstock)\nz × STD × √LT\nwhere z is chosen from statistical tables to ensure that the\nwhere z is chosen from statistical tables to ensure that the\nprobability of stockouts during leadtime is 100%-SL.\n(c)Copyright 2002 D. Simchi-Levi\n\nExample\n- The distributor has historically observed weekly\ndemandd off:\nAVG = 44.6 STD = 32.1\nReplenishment lead time is 2 weeks and desired\nReplenishment lead time is 2 weeks, and desired\nservice level SL = 97%\n- Average demand during lead time is:\nAverage demand during lead time is:\n44.6 × 2 = 89.2\n- Safety Stock is:\n1.88 × 32.1 × √2 = 85.3\n- Reorder point is thus 175, or about 3.9 weeks of\nsupply at warehouse and in the pipeline\n(c)Copyright 2002 D.
