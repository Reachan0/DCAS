  "course_description": "1.040 Project Management focuses on the management and implementation of construction projects, primarily infrastructure projects. A project refers to a temporary piece of work undertaken to create a unique product or service. Whereas operations are continuous and repeating, projects are finite and have an end date. Projects bring form or function to ideas or need. Some notable projects include the Manhattan Project (developing the first nuclear weapon); the Human Genome Project (mapping the human genome); and the Central Artery Project (Boston’s “Big Dig”). The field of project management deals with the planning, execution, and controlling of projects.\nThe course is divided into three parts:\nPart 1: project finance\nPart 2: project evaluation\nPart 3: project organization\nThis course will cover the basic tools, skills, and knowledge necessary to successfully manage a project through its inception, design, planning, construction, and transition phases. There will be several guest lectures discussing current projects, and a construction site visit to MIT’s Media Lab extension.",

Designer\n2. Contractor and subcontractors\n3. Owner\nEach role group will include an advisor who has the corresponding role on the Media Lab\nproject, i.e. the architect will participate with the designer group, the contractor will\nparticipate with the contractor and subcontractor group, and MIT's project manager will\nparticipate with the owner group.\nScenario:\nA steel beam was procured and installed; however, architectural drawings do not show\nthe need for a beam.\nDeliverables:\nEach role group is to:\n1. Evaluate given and acquired information and render an opinion about possible\ncause and responsibility.\n2. Present a summary of findings to the other groups in a comprehensive debriefing\nsession.\nPreparation:\n1. Students shall be assigned to role groups (roughly 1/3 of the class in each).\n2. Select a spokesperson to represent each role group.\n3. The spokesperson is to discuss the exercise with the group advisor."
