      "content": "Eyewitness testimony\nBackground\nAlthough eyewitness testimony is often used in court cases, it is notoriously unreliable.\nMany experiments have shown that people's memory for crime scenes and criminals' faces\ncan be manipulated by things they experience during or after the crime. For example, the\nway people are questioned about a crime after the fact may change their memory of the\nevents or introduce false elements. In one experiment, subjects viewed images of a car\naccident and were asked questions about the images. Subjects who were asked about\nthings that weren't in the images (such as a stop sign, or a yield sign), were more likely to\nfalsely remember seeing those things at a later follow-up session than subjects who weren't\nasked about those objects. Similarly, studies of police line-ups and photo lineups have\nshown that it is very easy to introduce subtle biases that cause witnesses to falsely identify\ninnocent people.\nJohn is writing a dissertation in criminal law and wants to include some original research on\neyewitness testimony and the problem of false identification. He's particularly interested in\nwhether eyewitnesses are likely to mistake innocent bystanders (ie, people who were also\npresent at the crime scene at the time of the crime) for perpetrators, particularly if the\nwitnesses are questioned long after the crime took place.\nExperiment\nJohn teams up with some friends from the psychology major to design an experiment. They\ndecide that there are too many ethical and logistical problems involved in staging fake\ncrimes, or even making people look at photos of crimes. Instead, they devise a memory\ntest that simulates the problem of eyewitness testimony, but doesn't involve showing actual\ncrimes. They will show subjects a series of everyday photos and ask subjects to remember\ncertain people (the \"criminals\"). Afterwards, they will ask people to spot the faces of\n\"criminals\" among distractor faces which also came from the memory set, but which the\nsubjects hadn't been asked to memorize (the \"bystanders\"). They hypothesize that\nsubjects will incorrectly identify many of the \"bystanders\" as criminals.\nIn the experiment, subjects saw 200 pictures of everyday scenes (a student in a library,\npeople on a farm, a woman buying groceries, etc.). Subjects were told to memorize the\nshop scenes because the people in the shops were \"shoplifters\" and subjects would later be\ntested on how well they could identify the \"shoplifter\" faces. There were 10 of these shop\nscenes in the experiment, each with exactly one person (whose face could be seen pretty\nclearly).\nFor the memory test, subjects were shown cropped images of the faces of the \"shoplifters,\"\nas well as 10 cropped faces from other photos. These were shown one at a time, shuffled\ntogether in random order. Subjects simply had to say whether the face was a \"shoplifter\"\nor not. One group of subjects was tested immediately after viewing the 200 photos, and a\nsecond group of subjects was tested exactly two weeks later.\nJohn recruited 40 subjects from the school population for the first group (which was tested\nimmediately), and the psychology students recruited 40 people from one of their psychology\nclasses for the second group (which was tested after two weeks). This was done because\n\nJohn was not sure he could get subjects to come back after two weeks, whereas the\npsychology students knew they would see their classmates every week.\nResults\nTo determine how well the \"eyewitnesses\" performed, John counts the number of false\nalarms in each group. He finds that subjects who were tested immediately after viewing the\nphotos falsely identified the \"bystander\" faces as \"shoplifters\" 7.8 times out of 10, on\naverage. Subjects who were tested two weeks later made the same error 5.5 times out of\n10. He concludes that eyewitnesses are very likely to falsely identify innocent bystanders\nas criminals (more than half the time), and that, surprisingly, eyewitness testimony\nbecomes more reliable if people are questioned some time after a crime, rather than\nimmediately afterwards.\nDo you agree with John's conclusion? Are there mistakes in this experiment that might\nexplain the results?\n\nAnswer key\n1.\nJohn's conclusion is too ambitious - even if there were no other problems with this\nexperiment, it's not clear how well these results would generalize to actual real-world crime\nsituations. Actual eyewitnesses might be less likely to mistake bystanders for criminals\nbecause their attention is much more focused on the criminal (whereas in this experiment,\nthe subjects might have been bored and distracted - pictures of people shopping are not\nthat exciting). Alternatively, eyewitnesses might be less reliable because they are often\nfrightened and under stress. In addition, real eyewitnesses must compare their memory of\nthe criminal to a mugshot (which might be years out of date, with different hair, clothes,\netc.), not an exact copy of the face seen at the crime scene, so the memory task really isn't\nthat similar to the real-world case.\n2.\nThe fact that one group is all psychology students (who know the experimenters!) and\nthe other is not introduces a major confound. The psychologists who were tested two\nweeks after the experiment might have made fewer false alarms because they knew more\nabout memory or had different expectations or strategies than the naive subjects who were\ntested immediately.\n3.\nCounting only the false alarms is a bad way to judge memory performance. Perhaps\nthe group who was tested two weeks later were just less likely, in general, to say that they\nhad seen a face before. John needs to look at the performance on the \"shoplifter\" faces\n(hits and misses) and not just false alarms, in order to understand how people perform on\nthis memory test.\n4.\nSince the test faces are all crops from the original images, it's possible that people\nwere using background information from the cropped images to decide whether they had\nseen a face before. (They might have decided whether or not a face was a \"shoplifter\" by\nwhether the face's background contained shop-like things like shelves, or non-shop things\nlike trees or sky.)\n5.\nIt's not clear how well matched the \"shoplifter\" and \"bystander\" faces were. If there\nwere consistent differences between these (for example, the shoppers were mostly male,\nand the other faces mostly female), this might have affected the results.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.63 Laboratory in Visual Cognition\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "Issue Spotter - Prototypes\nBackground\nPart of cognitive psychology explores the concept of concepts. What cognitive events\nhappen when you think about a chair? How is the concept of chair represented in the\ncognitive system? This is a subtle issue.\nFor example, surely a seat at a formal dining table is chair, but what about a recliner, a\nstool, a couch, or a tree stump? The issue is important because the representation of\nconcepts is the basis of everything else we can mentally do with concepts. In a very real\nsense how we think and what we can learn is largely determined by how we represent\nconcepts.\nAn efficient way to represent concepts would be to keep only the critical properties of a\nconcept. This set of critical properties is sometimes called a prototype or schema. The\nidea of prototypes is that a person has a mental construct that identifies typical\ncharacteristics of various categories. When a person encounters a new object he/she\ncompares it to the prototypes in memory. If it matches the prototype for a chair well\nenough the new object will be classified and treated as a chair. This approach allows new\nobjects to be interpreted on the basis of previously learned information. It is a powerful\napproach because one does not\nneed to store all previously seen chairs in long term memory. Instead, only the\nprototype needs to be kept.\nExperiment\nMervin and Ed would like to investigate the creation and storage of concepts, so they\ndecide to replicate a method used by Posner and Keele in 1968, one of the earliest\nstudies to systematically explore concept representation in a controlled way. Like Posner\nand Keele, Mervin and Ed would like their participants to learn patterns of dots rather\nthan using an already well-known concept like a chair.\nThey create three dot-pattern prototypes and derive from them three sets. Each set\nincludes the given prototype and two variations. During the training phase, they ask the\nonly participant they found (Ed, one of the experimenter) to learn to classify each set,\nwith the underlying prototype being the basis for correct classifications.\nAfter learning to classify the three sets, the participant was shown a variety of dot\npatterns. In particular, he was shown patterns that were shown during the training\nphase and new variant patterns. At the end of the training phase, classification and\nreaction time performance were nearly equal for the previously seen variants and the\nprototypes. During testing, performance was slightly worse for the new variants.\nMervin and Ed agreed that this is significant because the new variants were never seen\nduring testing. To classify dot patterns that were not previously seen, the participant\n\nmust be using a mental concept of what corresponds to the different categories. Since\nperformance is better for the prototype patterns than for the new variants, the mental\nconcept is similar to the prototype patterns.\nThe experimenters concluded that people create a mental representation that is a\nmixture of the variant patterns used during training, that is, a prototype.\nReferences\nReed, S.

      "content": "Spatial cueing\nBackground\nAccording to the \"spotlight\" theory, visual attention is like a beam which can be focused on\none area of a scene to highlight objects and events in that area. A classic experiment which\nshows this \"spotlight\" effect is the spatial cueing experiment. In this experiment, subjects\nasked to maintain fixation in the center of a screen and detect (as quickly as possible)\ntargets which can appear either to the left or right of fixation. At the start of each trial, the\nsubject sees a cue (such as an arrow) which points to the likely location of the target. After\nthe cue vanishes, a target (such as a red dot) appears in either the left or right location and\nthe subject must press a key as soon as he detects the target. Although the subject cannot\nmove his eyes, he can shift his attention to the side indicated by the cue. Most of the cues\nare valid (ie, the arrow points to where the target will appear). But every so often, there is\nan invalid cue (the arrow points in one direction, but the target appears on the other side).\nThe typical finding in this experiment is that subjects are faster to detect the targets after\nvalid cues, and slower to detect the target after invalid cues (relative to a control condition\nwith a neutral cue, which signals that the target is equally likely to appear in either\nlocation). The speed difference for valid and invalid cues suggests that subjects are shifting\ntheir attentional \"spotlight\" according to the cue, becoming more sensitive to events in the\n\"spotlighted\" area (but less sensitive to events occurring outside the field of attention).\nAbnormal patterns of attention are a hallmark of many cognitive disorders, including\nautism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's. Two undergraduate cognitive science students,\nCassandra and Dawn, are asked to do a study of attention in a patient population for a\nclinical psychology class. They decide to investigate attention in austistic spectrum disorders\nby running a spatial cueing experiment on young adults with Asperger's Syndrome.\nExperiment\nCassandra and Dawn recruited 15 participants (12 male, 3 female) with the help of an\nautism/ADHD research group associated with their university. The only requirements for the\nstudy were that participants had to be between the ages of 18 and 26 and have a diagnosis\nof Asperger's Syndrome.\nParticipants were seated at a computer screen in a dark, quiet room. The experimenter\n(either Dawn or Cassandra, selected at random) read instructions from a script. Participants\nwere told that they would need to maintain fixation on a cross on the center of the screen,\nwhile targets (red dots) appeared on one side of the screen or the other. The participant's\njob was to press the spacebar as quickly as possible when they saw the target. Before each\ntarget appeared, there would be a cue, which was either a left arrow (signifying the target\nwas most likely to appear on the left), a right arrow (signifying a target on the right), or a\ndouble-headed arrow (a neutral cue which meant that the target was equally likely to\nappear on either side). Participants were told that they would need to start each trial by\npressing the return key, and that they could take breaks whenever they needed throughout\nthe experiment. Participants were given an opportunity to ask questions to ensure that they\nunderstood the instructions.\n\nThe experiment consisted of 200 trials, half experimental trials (with left/right arrow cues)\nand half control trials (with neutral, double-headed arrow cues). Of the arrow cues, half\nwere valid cues (the arrow pointed in the direction in which the target would appear) and\nthe other half were invalid cues (the arrow pointed in one direction, but then the target\nappeared on the other side). The arrow appeared 400 ms after the start of the trial,\nremained on screen for 1000 ms, and then vanished; at which point, simultaneously, the\ntarget appeared on the screen. The various types of trial (valid cue, invalid cue, and neutral\ncue) were mixed together and shown in a random order. Within each trial type, there were\nexactly as many right-hand targets as left-hand targets, and the valid and invalid cue trials\nwere also balanced so that there were equal numbers of right arrows and left arrows within\neach type of trial.\nResults\nThe typical pattern of results for a spatial cueing experiment is that people are, on average,\nfastest to detect the target on valid cue trials, slowest on invalid cue trials, and in between\non the neutral cue trials. However, this was not what Cassandra and Dawn found with the\nAsperger's Syndrome adults. These subjects did not perform differently on the different\ntypes of trials: they responded to targets at the same speed no matter whether they saw a\nvalid cue, invalid cue, or a neutral cue. Dawn thinks these results are exciting and show that\nthere is something very unusual about visual attention in individuals with Asperger's\nSyndrome. However, Cassandra disagrees. She thinks the results could have been caused\nby methodological issues and might have nothing to do with Asperger's Syndrome. What do\nyou think?\nAnswer key\n1.\nThe number one problem is that they didn't include a non-patient control group.\nWithout this, they have no way of knowing that their findings have anything to do with\nAsperger's Syndrome. In fact, given the other serious flaws with this experiment, it's likely\nthat a non-patient group would give exactly the same results (no spatial cueing effect).\n2.\nAnother huge problem is that the cues did not actually tell people anything about\nwhere the target would appear, so participants might have just ignored them. Since half of\nthe cues were valid and half invalid, the odds of a target appearing on the right after a\nright-arrow cue was only 50/50 (same as the odds after a neutral cue). Participants may\nhave picked up on this, consciously or unconsciously, and just treated the arrow cues as\nneutral cues, since they were really no more informative. (Normally this problem is avoided\nby having far more valid than invalid cues, ie 80% valid cue trials and 20% invalid cue\ntrials.)\n3.\nMaking the target appear at exactly the same time the arrow disappeared was probably\na bad idea - the sudden disappearance of the arrow probably would tend to draw\nparticipants' attention back to the center of the screen when they should have been keeping\ntheir attention focused on one side of the screen or the other.\n4.\nIt's possible that participants cheated by anticipating the target and just pressing the\nbutton when they thought a target was about to appear. It would be a good idea to look at\nthe individual RTs and see if many of them are abnormally fast (it takes some time for a\nsignal to travel from the eyes to the fingers - subjects who respond much too quickly\ncannot be detecting the target; they are guessing or anticipating the target).\n\n5.\nSimilarly, it's possible that participants were cheating by moving their eyes (however,\neye movements would probably not explain these results). An eyetracker could have been\nused to make sure that participants maintained fixation throughout each trial.\n6.\nThe intermixed design might have caused additional problems in a patient population\nwhich has problems with task switching; patients might find it difficult to switch between\nusing the cue in experimental trials and ignoring it in control trials, and perhaps they wound\nup ignoring the cue in all trials. I'm not sure whether this is a likely problem with Asperger's\nSyndrome individuals, but might have been worthwhile to try a blocked design in addition to\nthe intermixed.\n7.\nIt's possible that participants did not understand the instructions and did not feel\ncomfortable asking the experimenter for an explanation. (The way the instructions were\npresented in this experiment might have been particularly bad for autistic spectrum\nindividuals, who are likely to have problems with social interaction and language.)\n8.\nThe students probably should have screened their participants for other disorders, so\nthey could either exclude certain subjects or use the extra data in their analysis. Since\nparticipants were recruited from an autism/ADHD research group, it's likely that some\nparticipants had both ADHD and Asperger's. The ADHD individuals might have been driving\nany results that showed an unusual pattern of attention.\n9.\nYou could argue that the participant pool is biased towards males and they should have\ntried to include more women in the study (but on the other hand, about 80% of the people\nwith Asperger's Syndrome are male, so their sample is actually very representative of the\npopulation).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.63 Laboratory in Visual Cognition\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Typically in memory experiments,\nparticipants are shown a list of words and\nlater asked to make a \"yes\" or \"no\"\nstatement as to whether they remember\nseeing an item before. Alternatively,\nparticipants make \"old\" or \"new\" responses.\nThe results of the experiment can be\nportrayed in what is called a decision\nmatrix.\n-\nThe hit rate is defined as the proportion of\n\"old\" responses given for items that are Old\nand the false alarm rate is the proportion of\n\"old\" responses given to items that are New.\nHypothetical distribution of yes and no response.\nThe decision criterion C determines whether\na \"yes\" or \"no\" response will be made.\nStrong evidence to the right of the criterion\nwill lead to \"yes\" responses and weak\nevidence to the \"left\" will lead to weak\nresponses.\nShort question\n- You want to design an experiment with 3\nconditions: A, B and C. Being a good\nscientist, you want to completely\ncounterbalance the order that subjects see\nthese conditions. Show what this factorial\ncounterbalancing looks like.\nShort question\n- You want to design an experiment with 3 conditions: A, B\nand C.

A main effect of variable 1, with no main effect of\nvariable 2 and no interaction.\nb.) A main effect of variable 1 and variable 2 with\ninteraction.\nc.) Interaction, but no main effects of either variable.\nInterpretation\n- Imagine a 2 factors experiment,\nwith a factor C with two levels (C1,\nC2) and a factor X with two levels\n(X1, X2). The dependent variable\nis a score from -10 to + 10. The\ngraph bellow show hypothetical\nresults. Interpret the results by\nlooking at the graph:\n- is their a main effect of factor C ?\n- is their a main effect of factor X ?\n- is their an interaction?\n\nInterpretation question\n- Greg is interested in whether or not children improve at\nknowing the past tense of a word between the ages of 3\nand 4.\n- He decides to follow a population of 20 children who\nhave just turned 3 and measure their performance on a\npast tense test. He gets a score for each child that\nindicates the percent the child got correct on the test.\nThen he waits until they have just turned 4 and he tests\nthe same children again on the same test. Greg now\nwants to find out if there is significant improvement\nbetween the children at age 3 and age 4. What kind of\nstatistical analysis should he do? Be specific.\nInterpretation\n-\nA group of students in 9.63 run an RSVP (Rapid\nSequential Visual Presentation) memory\nexperiment with 2 factors:\n-\n1- presentation time of each image in the sequence\n(0.1 second or 1 second) and\n-\n2- the type of images (faces or natural landscapes\npictures).\nEach RSVP stream had 12 different pictures. The\nexperiment was a between design with 10\nobservers per group. At testing, they present 50%\nof the same images and add 50% of novel images.\nThe dependent variable is d' (d prime). In the talk,\nthey present the following group results (see\ngraph).\n-\na) Based on the graph, interpret the d'\nperformances.\n-\nb) Is there an interaction?\n-\nc) If this was your pilot data, what would you\nchange for the main experiment? why?\n-1\nface\nlandscape\nType of images\nd '\n0.1 second\n1 second\nInterpretation\n-\nHuman and Model\n-\nYou want to compare a computational model of object detection to\nhuman performances. First, you have human observers performing\na car detection task (say if a picture of an urban environment has a\ncar or not). In your design, 50% of the images contained one car\nand 50% of the images have no car. You present the picture for only\n50 msec, and masked them, to avoid ceiling effect in performances.\n-\nYou observe that the mean HIT rate (correct positive responses) of\nhuman observers is 82 % and the mean HIT performance of your\nmodel is also 82%. You conclude that your model performs as well\nas human observers.\n-\nIs this conclusion valid? Do you need to take into account other\nmeasurement(s) of performances? which one(s) and why?\nInterpretation question\n- Remember the mental rotation coglab. Extend Shepard\nand Metzler's findings to another imagery task. What\nwould they predict about how long it would take to say\nhow many windows were in a familiar room in which the\nwindows were far apart from each other vs. how many\nwindows were in a familiar room in which the windows\nwere close together.\nInterpretation\nou and your two project partners\nY\nare analyzing some data for Projec\n3. You are looking at the effects of\nword length and word color on wor\nmemory. You chart your data and\nget the following bar graph:\nOne of your partners, Dan, claims\nthere is no interaction here, just a\nmain effect. Your other partner,\nEva, claims that there is an\ninteraction.

Their first factor was the type of vacation (sea\nvs. snow). The second factor was the source of the pictures (from agencies\nvs. from people).\n-\nTo collect the images, they visited several advertising sites and found 10\ncolorful pictures of beach vacations and 10 colorful pictures of ski\nvacations. They also had 20 pictures from the vacation snapshots of one of\nthe team members (10 pictures of sea and 10 pictures of snow vacations).\n-\nDuring the learning phase, each of 12 subjects saw all 40 pictures for 0.5\nsecond each (pictures were presented in random order). During the test\nphase, the 40 old pictures were randomly interleaved with 40 new pictures\n(more pictures of the vacation snapshots of one of the group members).\nParticipants had to say if the picture was an old or a new picture.\n-\nFrom the HITs and the False Alarms, the group computed a d prime for\neach subject\n\n-From the HITs and the False Alarms, the\ngroup computed a d prime for each\nsubject, and the results are shown on the\ngraph.\n-Interpret and criticize the results and the\nexperiment\n-is there an interaction?

One factor is the type of\nchange (location change or color change).\nThe second factor is the importance of the\nobject (central vs. marginal interest).\n- What are the other factors you should\ncontrol in this experiment?\nExperiment design\n-\nVideo Games You work for a video game company. The company is working on a\nnovel flight simulator game where the goal of the player is to detect and shoot enemy\naircraft. Your boss asks you to propose an experiment which will test something\ninteresting about the game. Your boss does not know much about experimental\nmethods, human vision, attention, or marketing, so you can choose a question and a\ndesign that involve:\n-\n-- a perceptual aspect of visual processing (e.g. the color of the aircraft),\n-\n-- an attentional aspect (e.g. false cues),\n-\n-- subjective aspects (e.g. how to make the game more interesting), or\n-\n-- a marketing aspect (e.g. how to sell the game to a particular population).\n-\nChoose a question related to the video game, and design one simple experiment\n(true or quasi-experimental design) which will test your question. Choose 1 or 2\nindependent variables, 1 dependent variable and 1 design (between or within).\nFormulate 1 or 2 hypotheses (interaction hypotheses are welcome but not a\nrequirement). Tell us about the population of subjects. Make sure we can understand\nyour design, and tell us what statistics you will run on the data you collect. Make\nsome predictions about the data you'll see, and draw a graph that illustrates the\nsignificant effects you expect to find. Explain briefly why you think your question is\ninteresting.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.63 Laboratory in Visual Cognition\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Which operation could you apply on the reaction\ntime data so that the distributions look more normal?\n\nA log\n\nQUESTION 3 (4 pts): What is an advantage of a 3 factor experimental design over a 2\nfactor design? What is a disadvantage?\n\nAdvantage: Broader picture of how variables interact and under what conditions. You\nget a better idea of generality\nDisadvantage: 3 way interactions are hard to interpret. Experimental design also is\nmore complicated.\n\nQUESTION 4 (4 pts): Why should grades be calculated in terms of Z-score?\nGrades in courses should be calculated in terms of z-scores if the mean and standard\ndeviations of the score vary widely from one test to the next. Thus a person eventual rank\nin the class is calculated more faithfully by finding the mean of the z-scores than by\nfinding the mean of the raw scores of the tests\n\nQUESTION 5 (4 pts): What does an F-test < 1 mean?\nWithin-groups variance >> Between-group variance\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUESTION 6 (4 pts): Cite two implicit memory tests.\n\nWord-fragment completion task, word stem completion test or Word identification test:\nsubjects saw perceptually degraded word (pieces of each letter were obliterated) and\nwere instructed to name the word (measure of priming)\n\nQUESTION 7 (5 pts): The data of an old-new visual memory experiment are as follows\n(in term of d prime): 0.2, 0.1, -0.1, -0.3, 0.15, 0.04, -0.03. What can you conclude?\n\nData at random - one can conclude nothing\n\nQUESTION 8 (5 pts): When testing a brain-damaged patient, which are the control\ngroup(s) needed?\n\nTwo controls group: (1) control normal, (2) another brain damage population of a\ndifferent brain damage type\n\nQUESTION 9 (5 pts): You are using a memory paradigm that requires the participant to\nlisten to a list of words and recall them. You want to induce a false memory for the\nword \"car\". Construct a list of 10 words that will do that and explain why you\nconstructed it this way.\n\nAny 10 words having to do with car will do.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL QUESTIONS: CHOOSE ONE QUESTION (QUESTION 11 or\n12 - FOR A TOTAL OF 10 POINTS) (estimated time: 10 minutes)\n\nQUESTION 11 (10 pts): Give an explanation of the attentional blink effect. If an\nobserver does not show an attentional blink effect in a trial, what might that mean about\nwhether they processed a) T1 and b) T2 ? Justify your answer.\n\nSeveral possible reason: they did not see T1 so they had all the attention on T2 OR they\nwere able to process both T1 and T2 (video game players for instance)\n\nOR\n\nQUESTION 12 (10 pts): Sketch a graph of each of the 4 following hypothetical results\n\na.) A main effect of variable 1, with no main effect of variable 2 and no interaction.\nb.) A main effect of variable 1 and variable 2 with interaction.\nc.) Interaction, but no main effects of either variable.\nd.) No interaction and no main effects of either variable.\n\nINTERPRETATION QUESTIONS: ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS 13 - 17\n(FOR A TOTAL OF 55 POINTS) (estimated time: 1 hour)\n\nQUESTION 13 (15 pts): When observers view a pattern moving in one direction for a\nfew seconds and then look at a stationary pattern, the stationary pattern will appear to\nmove in the opposite direction (the motion aftereffect). For example, if you stare at\nsomething moving to the right for a few seconds, then a stationary pattern will appear to\nmove to the left.\n\nYou are conducting an experiment to measure the strength of the motion aftereffect for 2\ndifferent types of stimulus: (1) a black and white striped pattern that can move left or\nright and (2) a red and green striped pattern that can move left or right. The question is,\ndoes your brain's motion-detection system treat these two patterns differently?\n\na. Describe how you would test this using the method of adjustment. Draw possible\nresults of this experiment (make sure to label the Y-axis and the X-axis). What are the\ndisadvantages of this method?\n\nHave the participant view the moving stripe stimuli, and then have them adjust the\nsubsequent pattern until it appears to be stationary. The result graph would be a bar\ngraph showing the point of adjustment to a perception of no motion, with the color on\nthe x axis, and y axis being the speed relative to inducing stimulus. Disadvantages would\nbe observer bias.\n\nb. Describe how you would test this using the method of constant stimuli. Draw possible\nresults of this experiment (make sure to label the Y-axis and the X-axis). What are the\ndisadvantages of this method?\n\nTest the subject at varying speeds and directions, both for the bar stimuli and the\nsubsequent stimulus. Give them a 2 alternative forced choice about which direction the\nsecond stimulus is moving. From this, you should be able to calculate a psychometric\ncurve resembling the one below, with speed relative to inducing stimulus on x axis, and\nprobability response in one direction on y axis. The point of 50% probability is the point\nof subjective equality.\n\nQUESTION 14 (10 pts): Dr. Jones has a theory that the brain response to the first\nsyllable of a word is different from the brain response to later syllables. She wants to test\nthis hypothesis by having people listen to two-syllable words in the fMRI scanner. She\nwill then compare the brain response when the subjects while listening to the first syllable,\nthe second syllable, and during a fixation condition. She asks you for feedback on her\nexperimental design.\n\na) What is the purpose of the fixation condition?\nProvide a baseline for subtracting out background processes that don't have anything ot\ndo with the task. (5pts)\n\nb) You see one flaw in her design. What is it, and what change would you recommend?\nAssume that she has good earphones that get around any scanner noise issues.\nfMRI does not have the temporal resolution to differentiate between syllables of the same\nword. The hemodynamic response is too coarse. This experiment would be better done\nwith EEG or MEG. (5pts)\n\nQUESTION 15 (10 pts): It is said that people have different representations of letters\nand digits. In fact, when people search for a letter among digits, the letter seems to \"pop-\nout\" without the need for a serial search.\n\na) You test some people on a search task with a letter as the target and digits as the\ndistractor (set size 3, 6, and 10). Draw the expected target absent and target present\ncurves. Remember to label your axes.\n\nb) Canadian postal workers spend a lot of time looking at Canadian postal codes, which\nintermix letters and digits. Therefore, they do not have this segregated representation of\nletters and digits. Draw the expected target absent and target present curves if you were\nto test them on the same search experiment. Explain any differences between these\nresults and part a.\n\nIn part a, a \"pop out\" effect with no need for serial search means that you'll get\nbasically a feature search curve. It would be like the blue lines. In part b, the search\nbecomes a conjunction search, so you would get the red lines. The graph above is from\ncoglab 2.\n\nQUESTION 16 (10 pts): You are using the method of limits to measure the threshold\nof auditory perception. You plan to do the following measurements (the units are\narbitrary units of sound intensity).\n1. Start from sound level 20 and get louder by 10 units at a time until detection.\n2. Start from sound level 100 and get softer 10 units at a time until sound can no longer\nbe detected.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 three times.\n4. Average the thresholds measured at each step to come up with a final threshold\nmeasure.\nWhat is wrong with your experiment? Justify your answer\n\nWith the method of limits, you have to start at different locations each time, or the subject\nmight start learning the number of steps until the threshold.\n\nThe answer is NOT that:\n1. units of 10 are too big, or that you need ot move at logarithmic steps. The units are\narbitrary, so you don't know how big the steps are, and don't know whether or not it's a\nlogarithmic scale.\n2. Differences occur when you go up vs. going down. That is why you average the\nthresholds to get a final answer.\n\nQUESTION 17 (10 pts): Attention can be shifted both voluntarily and involuntarily.\na) Describe a spatial cueing paradigm that measures the effects of involuntary attention\nshifting on target detection time.\nHave something like a dot that flashes quickly before the actual target.\n\nb) How can you modify the experiment to measure the effects of voluntary attention\nshifting?\nHave a higher level cue (like an arrow) that requires voluntary shifting of attention,\nrather than just automatic attention capture.\n\nEXTRA QUESTIONS (FOR 10 EXTRA POINTS TOTAL) - YOU CAN CHOOSE\nONE OF THE FOLLOWING 3 QUESTIONS 18,19, 20 OR ADD QUESTION 11\nOR QUESTION 12\n\nQUESTION 18 (10 pts):\n\nThe above picture shows a hypothetical data set from an experiment with two conditions.\nThe x axis represents test scores, and the y axis represents the number of people getting\nthat score in each condition. A t test between the two gives a p value of (p < .05)\na) Another data set has the same difference in means between the two conditions.\nHowever, a t test returns a non-significant difference (p > .40). Draw this data set.\n\nT test is a difference of score\nThis would have curves centered at the same points, but wider with more overlap.\n\nb) In a third experiment, you get a very small difference in means between the two\nexperiments. However, the difference between the two populations is highly significant\n(p < .001). Draw this data set.\n\nThis would have curves centered at closer points, but with narrower peaks and no\noverlap.\n\nQUESTION 19 (10 pts): A prominent fmri researcher has discovered a brain region\nthat responds selectively to images of donuts. You wonder whether this region represents\nall donuts as being the same, or if it differentiates between different flavors. Describe\ntwo fmri paradigms you can use to answer this question and explain how an experiment\nusing each paradigm would work.\n\nSubtraction paradigm: Have conditions of different flavors. See if activation in the area\nis greater for certain types of flavors vs. others\n\nRepetition suppression: Show a continuous stream of donuts. If you show 2 in the row of\nthe same flavor, do you get more suppression of activation in the donut area vs. when you\nshow 2 in a row of different flavors?\n\nOR\n\nQUESTION 20 (10 pts): Describe an original experiment (an idea of yours) that will\ntest the role of background complexity on a visual search task (describe the hypotheses,\nindependent factor(s), the dependant factor, the type of stimuli, the experimental\nprocedure and the expected results).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.63 Laboratory in Visual Cognition\nFall 2009\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

[[ RT, and set size/conjunction v. feature]]\n\nQUESTION 2 (2 pts): Give one example of a visual search asymmetry, and briefly say\nwhy [[ O vs Q, etc]]\n\nQUESTION 3 (3 pts): The data of an old-new visual memory experiment are as follows\n(in term of d prime): 4.9, 4.8, 4.65, 5, 4.82, 4.61, 4.3, 4.7. What can you conclude? [[\nceiling effect]]\n\nQUESTION 4 (3 pts): Is \"IQ\" measurement an ordinal, interval or ratio factor? Say\nbriefly why [interval, see the slide: no absolute zero and it is meaningless to say that X is twice as smart\nthan Y]]\n\nQUESTION 5 (4 pts): Which type of measurement scale is the variable \"d prime\" ?\nBriefly justify why giving 2 reasons. [[ ratio, it has a true zero, and twice d' value means twice more\nsensitivity than a single d' prime value]]\n\nQUESTION 6 (4 pts): Name a real life situation in which you might care more about a\nperson's signal detection sensitivity (d' prime) than the number of correct answers they\nget. [[anything will do - in class I said something about somebody who always says you look good no\nmatter what, and how that doesn't let you know if you really look OK today if you ask that person]]\n\nQUESTION 7 (4 pts): You are designing an experiment about facial emotion detection.\nIs \"emotion\" a continuous or a discrete factor? Justify briefly your answer. [[ it could be\nboth, depending on how you treat it: categorically or on a continuus scale - anything that make sense is\ngood here]]\n\nQUESTION 8 (4 pts): Give one example of a real life example or application where\nhaving a low d prime between HIT (correct yes answer) and False Alarm is an\nadvantage. [[ slide say face deformation, but any example that make sense is good]]\n\nQUESTION 9 (4 pts): In signal detection theory, your decision depends on the signal,\nmeasured by the sensitivity measure termed \"d prime\". What is the other measurement\n(not d prime measure) you need to take into account when taking a decision? Describe\nbriefly this other measurement and how you would calculate it, using HIT and FA. [\nresponse bias, C; must write the formula]].\n\nINTERPRETATION QUESTIONS: ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS 10 - 18\n(FOR A TOTAL OF 70 POINTS) (estimated time: 1 hour)\n\nQUESTION 10 (5 pts):\n\nAn experiment group in 9.63 asks people to remember a list of words. Half of the\nsubjects see a list of toys and half see a list of trucks. To test whether subjects can\nremember more toy words or more truck words, they use a one-tailed paired t-test and\nfind a significant difference (people remember more trucks). Is this the correct what to do\nthis analysis? If not, what statistics should the group have done? [[not correct; it should not be\npaired because they are different groups of subjects, and it should not be 1 tailed because it is interesting no\nmatter which way direction the effect is in]]\n\nQUESTION 11 (6 pts) One of the new results on the attentional blink paradigm is the\n\"spreading of sparing\" phenomena.\n\na.) Explain briefly what it is\nb.) Illustrate the \"spreading of sparing\" phenomena by explaining what the\nexperimental conditions to compare are.\n\nQUESTION 12 (6 pts):\n\na.) Draw a graph representing an interaction between two factors, but no main effect of\neither factor. [[a cross-over interaction, with an X]]\n\nb.) Draw a graph representing a main effect of variable 1, a main effect of variable 2 with\nan interaction.\n\nc.) Draw a graph representing a main effect of variable 1, a main effect of variable 2 with\nNO interaction.\n\nd.) Draw a graph representing No interaction and no main effects of either variable.\n\nQUESTION 13 (6 pts):\n\nBelow is a graph of results for an experiment of detection with two factors: factor A with\nconditions, A2, A2, A3 and A4; and factor B with conditions B1, and B2. Based on the\ngraph result\n\na.) is there a main effect of factor A ? justify briefly why [ Yes]\nb.) is there a main effect of factor B ? justify briefly why [ No]\nc.) is there an interaction ? justify briefly why [ No]\nd.) Let's imagine the Y axis (dependent factor) represent percent correct of detection.\nIn another experiment, all results of B2 are at zero. Is there still an interaction?\nJustify your answer. [ detection of zero is a floor effect, cannot interpret the data]\n\nA1\nA2\nA3\nA4\nB1\nB2\n\nQUESTION 14 (8 pts):\n\nFor a new video game picturing super-heroes all together (the 4 fantastics,\nSpiderman, Superman and Batman) you are designing a short trailer. You decide to\ndesign an RSVP task, where snapshots of super-heroes are shown in a rapid\nsuccession. You know that your viewers will not be necessarily experts at playing\nvideo games but will be looking for the new characters in the trailer.\n\na.) You do not want viewers to have an \"attentional blink\" between images, but you\nwant to have the images shown very rapidly. Which short image duration(s) or ranges\nof duration, do you use so that all the super-heroes snapshots are seen?\n\nb.) You want to insist on the 4 fantastics characters, and make sure they are seen as a\ngroup. Would you put them all in a row, or would you spread them among the other super\nheroes' characters? Justify briefly your answer. [[anything that make sense will be accepted: as a\ngroup, putting them in a row, due to the spreading of attention might be more efficient, but any other\nanswer that will make sense will be accepted]]\n\nQUESTION 15 (9 pts):\n\nYou are running an experiment with 3 different conditions and plan to run only 3\nobservers to start with. Each condition takes about 5 minutes to run.\na. Would you present the conditions to each of the 3 observers in the same\norder (A, B, then C)? Why not? [[ their could be order effects, you need to\ncounterbalance so they don't always do C last when they are tired, etc ]]\nb. In what order would you present the conditions? (Write both an example\norder and the name of the counterbalancing scheme) [[ Draw a 3x3 Latin\nsquare and say that it is a Latin Square ]]\nc. What is one potential confound having to do with this order of\npresentation? How many subjects would you need to avoid this\nconfound? [[ Some conditions still follow each other more often than others. So if\nsay, A is really tiring and B always follows A, they might do worse on B than C even if\nB isn't easier really. A full counterbalance (a full factorial design) would require 3*2*1\n= 6 observers]]\n\nQUESTION 16 (10 pts): You are living in a colony on Mars. Someone in the colony has\nbecome sick with an infectious disease that could destroy the colony, but you don't know\nwho it is. You've been put in charge of designing a test to detect the disease to try to save\nthe colony.\na.) Explain what a false negative and a false positive are in the context of this\ntest. [[ a false negative would be saying someone doesn't have the disease when really they\ndo; a false positive would be saying they have it when they don't ]]\n\nb.) In this particular circumstance, would you be more worried about false\nnegatives or false positives? [[ false negative; if you didn't figure out who had it the\nwhole colony would die ]]\n\nc.) What is a time where you would be more worried about the other kind of\nerror? (e.g., if you chose 'false positive' in B, write about a time you'd be\nmore worried about a 'false negative', and vice versa). [[ some time when\nsaying something has something when they don't is very very bad]]\n\nQUESTION 17 (10 pts): You are interested in whether the Fusiform Face Area (FFA)\nencodes information about the gender of a face. You've already run an experiment where\nyou show a series of all female faces and all male faces and subtract them, but the FFA\nshowed no difference in overall activity between those blocks of stimuli.\n\na.) Sketch out an experiment you would do to examine in more depth whether the\nFFA encodes gender, using one of the other methods we discussed in the fMRI lecture.\nInclude whether your design would be event-related or blocked, what your conditions\nwould be, and your hypothesis about what would happen if the FFA did encode gender\nand if it didn't. [[ NOTE: LONG ANSWER -- either a classification paradigm or an adaptation\nparadigm - the classification one would be blocked and the adaptation one would probably be event-related\nbut could be blocked]]\n\nb.) What do the colored blobs represent when people display fMRI data on a picture\nof a brain (Hint: it is not the activity level of a particular condition)? [[ the p-value of\nthe difference between two conditions]]\n\nQUESTION 18 (10 pts) : CHOOSE 18A OR 18B\n\nQUESTION 18 A\n\nThe graph above represents what somebody's memory might look like in an\nexperiment where they were shown a list of words and then given a test to see if\nthey remember those words. It represents, using a signal detection theory graph,\nhow familiar they are with both the words they have seen and the words they\nhaven't. The words they've seen before - targets - are in general more familiar to\nthem (further to the right on the x-axis) than the words that they did not see - the\nfoils -- but not always. However, because memory is not perfect, sometimes the\nfoils seem familiar as well. The vertical decision-line represents what level of\nfamiliarity with a word an ideal observer would use to decide whether to say\n\"yes\" or \"no\" at the test when asked whether they'd seen the word before (the\nobserver's criterion; they'd say yes to items to the right of the line and no to items\nto the left of the line).\n\na) Shade the area of the graph that represents items to which this observer\nwould false alarm. [[the area under the \"foils\" line that is to the right of the vertical\nbar]]\nb) If instead of making decisions with no bias, this person rarely missed\nany items they'd seen before, but also made many false alarms, where\nwould the vertical criterion line be in the graph? [[ the vertical line would be\nto the left of where it is now]]\nc) Draw a new graph just like the one above, but in a circumstance where\nthe observer's memory for the words was perfect (they made no misses\nand no false alarms). [[ the two Gaussians shouldn't overlap and the line should\ndivide them perfectly ]]\n\nQUESTION 18 B\n\n2)\n\nThese graphs represent performance from two different divided attention tasks\n(Task 1 and Task 2). In both cases, observers were performing one task in central\nvision (the x-axis) and one task in peripheral vision (the y-axis). The 100% marks\non the x and y-axes represent how well the observers did when they were\nperforming each of those tasks alone. The dots represent how well the same\nobservers did on the two tasks when they were performing both tasks at once\n(e.g., a circle whose x-coordinate is 95% means that when doing both tasks at\nonce, the observer performed 95% as well at the central task as they did when\nperforming the central task alone).\n\na. In which task (Task 1 or Task 2) were observers successfully able to\ndivide their attention and perform both tasks? Explain. [[ Task 1, since they\nare able to do both tasks at near 100% of their performance when doing each of them\nalone ]]\n\nb. If you gave the observers in Task 2 a different set of instructions, say,\nrewarding them a great deal of money for every trial they were correct\non the peripheral task, where would you expect their performance to be?\n(Draw the dots on the graph). [[ In the upper left corner; they wouldn't be able to\ndo both tasks still, but would prioritize the peripheral task over the central task]]\n\nEXTRA CREDIT POINT QUESTION (10 pts): choose question 19 OR answer to\nboth Question 18 above.\n\nQUESTION 19 Describe an experiment of visual search that will test the role of\ndistractor resemblance to the target, on target detection (describe the hypotheses,\nindependent factor(s), the dependant factor, the type of stimuli, the experimental\nprocedure and the expected results).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.63 Laboratory in Visual Cognition\nFall 2009\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

(The \"fundamental attribution\nerror,\" Ross, 1977.)\nThe purpose of statistics\n- As researchers, we need a principled way\nof analyzing data, to protect us from\ninventing elaborate explanations for\neffects in data that could have occurred\npredominantly due to chance.\nExample\nshort\nwords\n- You have subjects\nlong\nmemorize lists of\nwords\nwords, and record\nhow many they can\nremember.\n- Does the number\nthey can remember\ndepend upon word\nmean 7\nlength?\nToday we'll test whether the difference in\nmeans is \"significant,\" using a \"t-test\"\n- \"Significant\" = a difference in means this\nbig is unlikely to have occurred by chance\n- Thus there's likely to be a systematic,\ngeneralizable effect.\n- Let's get some intuitions: what might determine\nwhether or not we think a difference in means is\n\"significant\"?\n\nIs the difference in mean of these 2\ngroups systematic, or just due to\nchance?\nWhat about this difference in\nmean?\nWhat about this difference in\nmean?\nNormal distribution of data for\ntwo conditions\nIntuitions: Significant\ndifference in means\n- Occurs when the difference in means is large compared\nto the spread (e.g. variance s2 or standard deviation s) of\nthe data.\n- tstat ≈ (m1 - m2) / s\n- Depends upon the number of samples.\n- With more samples, we're willing to say a difference is significant\neven if the variance is a bit larger compared to the difference in\nmeans.\n- tstat = (m1 - m2) / standard error (SE)\n- Standard error = something like s/sqrt(n)\n- Degree of freedom (df) describe the number of samples (n-1)\nt-tests\n- In general, we'll compute from our data some tstat, of\nthe form:\ntstat = (m1 - m2)/SE\n- tstat is a measure of how reliable of a difference we're\nseeing between the two conditions.\n- If this number is \"big enough\" we'll say that there is a\nsignificant difference between the two conditions.\nN\normal dist\nribution of data\nfor two co\nn d i t i o n s .\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\nN\normal dist\nribution of data\nfor two co\nn d i t i o n s .\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nThe t Test\nt =\nDifference between groups (means)\nNormal variability within group (or standard error SE)\n-\nIf\n\nt is large, the difference between groups is much bigger than\nthe normal variability within groups.\n- Therefore, two groups are significantly different from each other\n-\nIf\n\nt is small, the difference between groups is much smaller\nthan the normal variability within groups.\n- Therefore, two groups are not significantly different from each other\nt-tests\n- Would like to set a threshold,\ntcrit, such that tstat>tcrit means\nthe difference we see betweenN\no\nrmal distr\nibution of data\nfor two con\nd i t i o n s .\nthe conditions is unlikely to\nhave occurred by chance (and\nthus there's likely to be a real\nsystematic difference between\nthe two conditions).\n- How big is tstat likely to be if\nRead t-crit estimation\nthere's actually no difference\nin a table\nbetween the two conditions?\nIn the word experiment\n(cf. t-testdemo excel file):\nOK, so here's the general plan:\ndf=5, level of significance is 0.05\nFigure removed due to copyright restriction.\n- Compute tstat and df from your data\n(cf. T-TestDemo.xls)\n- Decide upon a level of confidence (significance).\n99% and 95% are typical.\n=> significance level, α = 0.01 or 0.05\n- From this, and a t-table, find tcrit\n- Compare tstat to this threshold.\n- If |tstat|>|tcrit|, \"the difference is significant\", there's likely an\nactual difference between the two conditions.\n- If not, the difference is \"not significant.\"\n3 kinds of t-tests\n- Case 1: The two samples are related, i.e. not\nindependent (e.g. the same subject did the 2 conditions\nof your experiment)\n- Case 2: The samples are independent (e.g. different\nsubjects), and the variances of the populations are\nequal.\n- Case 3: The samples are independent, and the\nvariances of the populations are not equal.\nAll tests are of the same form. We just need to know, for\neach case, how to compute SE (and thus tstat), and what\nis df.\nCase 1: When do you have related or\npaired samples?\n- When you test each subject on both conditions.\n- E.G. You ask 100 subjects two geography questions:\none about France, and the other about Great Britain.\nYou then want to compare scores on the France\nquestion to scores on the Great Britain question.\n- These two samples (answer, France, & answer, GB)\nare not independent - someone getting the France\nquestion right may be good at geography, and thus\nmore likely to get the GB question right.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nCase 1: When do you have related\nor paired samples?\n- When you have \"matched samples\".\n- E.G.

Actually, the variance is computed as to how\nmuch the individual group means differ from the overall\nmean of all scores in the experiment.\n- (2) Within groups variance: give an estimate of how\nmuch the participants in a group differ from one\nanother (or the mean of the group)\nANOVA\n- Basic idea: are the scores of the different\ngroups or conditions different from each\nother?\n- Null hypothesis: all the participants in the\nvarious conditions are drawn from the\nsame population: the experimental\nvariable has no effect.\n- Consequence of the null hypothesis on the\nbetween and within variance?\n\nANOVA\n- Basic idea: are the scores of the different\ngroups or conditions different from each\nother?\n- Null hypothesis: all the participants in the\nvarious conditions are drawn from the\nsame population: the experimental\nvariable has no effect.\n- Consequence of the null hypothesis: the\nbetween group variance should be the\nsame as the between group variance\nANOVA\n- To reject the null hypothesis, the means of the different groups must\nvary from one another more than the scores vary within the groups\n- The greater the variance (differences) between the groups of the\nexperiment, the more likely the independent variable is to have had\nan effect, especially if the within group variance is low\n- The F test is simply a ratio of the between groups variance estimate\nto the within-groups variance estimate\nBetween-groups variance\nF = ----------------------------\nWithin-groups variance\n\nANOVA\n- Under the null hypothesis, the F ratio should be ?\nBetween-groups variance\nF = ----------------------------\nWithin-groups variance\nANOVA\n- Under the null hypothesis, the F ratio should be 1\n- The greater the between groups variance is than the\nwithin group variance and consequently, the greater the\nF ratio is than 1.00, the more confident we can be in\nrejecting the null hypothesis.\nBetween-groups variance\nF = ----------------------------\nWithin-groups variance\n\nSources of Variability\n- Some of the variability comes from variability\namong subjects: how people differ from one\nanother regardless of the experimental\nconditions (e.g. some subjects are slow, some\nsubjects are faster)\n- Other variability is caused by the\nindependent variables, which cause subjects\nto behave differently.\nANOVA\n- Variance is simply a way to measure the\ndifferences between the scores (data)\n- ANOVA involves partitioning the\nvariances: we take the total variability of\nthe scores in an experiment and we\nbreak it up in terms of its sources\n\nSources of variance\nTotal variance\nin the scores\nVariance between\ngroups\nVariance within\ngroups\nA toy case:\nPartitioning the variance\ne.g. an experiment with 9 subjects\nFrequency\nScore (data)\nWe see a certain amount of variability among the subjects, but we do not know\nhow much is between groups variance and how much is within groups variance\n\nIf all the variance is between groups\nG1\nG2\nG3\nGroup 1\nGroup 2\nGroup 3\nIf all the variance is\nwithin groups\nG1\nG2\nG3\nGroup 1\nGroup 2\nGroup 3\n\nStep : Heart of ANOVA\nTotal variance\nIn the scores\nVariance between\nGroups: mean square\ndeviation between\ngroups\nVariance within\nGroups: mean square\ndeviation within\ngroups\nSources of variances\nVariance between\nGroups: mean square\ndeviation between\ngroups\nVariance within\nGroups: mean square\ndeviation within\ngroups\nTotal variance\nIn the scores\n\nTotal variance\nIn the scores\nThe mean square between groups is an estimate of the difference in scores\nthat occur between the levels in a factor (or independent variable A)\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nLevel A1\nLevel A2\nX1\nX2\nHere, we find the\ndifference between\nthe mean of\neach condition\nand the overall mean\nof the study\n(mean)\nOverall X\nVariance between\nGroups: mean square\ndeviation between\ngroups\nThe mean square within groups is an estimate of the variability in scores\nas measured by differences within the conditions of an experiment\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nLevel A1\nLevel A2\nX1\nX2\nHere, we find the difference\nbetween each score in a condition\nand the mean of that condition\n(mean)\nTotal variance\nIn the scores\nVariance within\nGroups: mean square\ndeviation within\ngroups\n(mean)\n1) find the variance in level 1\n2) find the variance in level 2\n3) \"pool\" -

False positives occur if a person says yes (a positive\nresponse) but this is wrong (false) because no signal\nwas presented. A false positive response can also be\ncalled a false alarm. If you thought you heard somebody\ncall your name, but nobody actually did, that is a false\npositive.\nProsopagnosia, amnesia\nfalse negatives\n- False negatives occur\nwhen a person says\nno (a negative\nresponse) but this is\nfalse because actually\na signal was\npresented.\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\n- An example would be\nfailing to detect a blip\non a radar screen.\nFigures by MIT OpenCourseWare.\nFigures by MIT OpenCourseWare.\nFigures by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nWhen false negatives\ncost a lot..\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\n- In some situations, false positives (or false alarm) do not cause as\nmuch harm as false negatives.\n- Consider a blood bank screening samples for the AIDS (HIV) virus.\nThe initial screening of blood samples uses a very sensitive test\ndesigned to eliminate false negatives, even though that means there\nwill be some false positives.\n- False positives, in this case, are blood samples which test positive for\nthe HIV virus, although later testing shows they are not really infected.\n- These false positives have a cost--some blood is wasted--but that is\na small price to pay for the security of knowing that no infected blood\nis given to hospital patients who receive transfusions. In other words,\nthere must be no false negatives in this situation.\nWhen false positives cost a lot..\n- In other situations, a more important goal is to avoid\nfalse positives at all costs.\n- A hunter must learn not to shoot at everything that\nmoves in the bushes, because the moving object might\nbe a human or a dog. The hunter must wait until the form\nof the object becomes clear. The threshold for pulling the\ntrigger and shooting must be raised so that a signal does\nnot lead to a response unless the signal is clearly\nperceived.\n- False negatives (failing to shoot) are less important than\nfalse positives (shooting the wrong thing).\nA tumor scenario\n-\nYou are a radiologist examining a\nCT scan, looking for a tumor.\n-\nThe task is hard, so there is some\nuncertainty: either there is a tumor\n(signal present), or there is not\n(signal absent).

For each\ndecision, you have a certain level of\n\"internal\" certainty.\n-\nYour internal response depends on the\nvisual information (stimulus intensity) and\nthe state of your sensory system (which\nvaries for a given observer (tired, confident,\nmore or less attention, too much caffeine).\n-\nSDT assumes that the sensory system of\nthe observer is \"noisy\", meaning it is subject\nto random fluctuations that are unrelated to\nthe stimulus event. Even if the visual\nstimulus is the same, the sensory signal will\nnot be the same on every trials.\n-\nSDT assumes that the sensory response will\nvary randomly over trials around an average\nvalue, producing a normal distribution of\nstrengh values (of internal response).\nFigure 1: Internal response probability of occurrence curves\nfor noise-alone and for signal-plus-noise trials.\nAdapted from David Heeger document\nFigures removed due to copyright restrictions.\nSignal Detection Theory: Definition\n- Signal detection theory, is a means to\nquantify the ability to discern between a\nsignal and the absence of signal (or noise)\n- Your decision depends on the signal but\nalso your response bias\nMap of the course\n- I - Signal Detection Theory : Why it is\nimportant, interesting and fun?\n- II - Some Basic reminders\n- III - Signal Detection Theory: Core\n- IV - Signal Detection Theory: Advanced\nNormal Distribution\nMean\nNormal Distribution\n-\nEach side of the normal curve has a point where the curve slightly reverses its direction: this\nis the inflection point\n-\nThe inflection point is always one standard-deviation from the mean\n-\nAbout 68 % of all scores are contained within one standard deviation of the mean\n-\n96 % of the scores are contained within 2 stdev\n-\n99.74 % of the scores are contained within 3 stdev\n-\nThis property of normal curves is extremely useful because if we know an individual's score\nand the mean and standard deviation in the distribution of scores, we also know the person\nrelative rank.\nNormal\ndistribution\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\nNorma\nl Distribution Curve.\nFigure by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\nIQ Population\nDistribution\nNormal Curve and Z scores\n- It is common to compare scores across\nnormal distributions with different means\nand variances in terms of standard scores\nor Z-scores\n- The z-score is the difference between an\nindividual score and the mean expressed in\nunits of standard deviations.\n% of people with this score\n14%\n10%\n6%\n2%\nIQ\nMost IQ tests are devised so that the population mean is 100 and the stdev is 15.\nIf a person has an IQ of 115, she has scored higher than XX % of all people.\nMap of the course\n- I - Signal Detection Theory : Why it is\nimportant, interesting and fun?\n- II - Some Basic reminders\n- III - Signal Detection Theory: Core\n- IV - Signal Detection Theory: Advanced\nSignal Detection Theory (SDT)\n- The underlying model of SDT consists of two normal\ndistributions\n- One representing a signal (target present)\n- The other one representing the \"noise\" (target absent)\n- The willingness of the person to say 'Signal Present' in\nresponse to an ambiguous stimulus is represented by\nthe criterion.\nStimulus\nrepresentation\nSignal Detection: Intuition\n- Consider 2 participants in a visual detection task\nof a faint target.

This means that\nalthough we can add and subtract degrees (100° is 10° warmer than\n90°), we cannot multiply values or create ratios (100° is not twice as\nwarm as 50°).\n- When you are asked to rate your satisfaction with a piece of\nsoftware on a 7 point scale, from Dissatisfied to Satisfied, you are\nusing an interval scale.\nRatio Scale\n- A ratio scale is one that has a meaningful zero point as\nwell as meaningful differences between the numbers on\nthe scale. As well as all of the nominal, ordinal and\ninterval properties.\n- It is meaningful to consider multiplicative differences\namong attributes.\n- Measures such as responses speed and percentage\ncorrect are ratio measures because you can exhibit zero\nspeed or no correct response.\nVariables and Scales\nZIP code\nGender\nMajor programs\nPlacement in a beauty contest\nOrder in a race\nIQ measures\nSAT scores\nResponse speed\npercentage\nNominal\nOrdinal\nInterval\nRatio\n\nVariables and Scales\nZIP code\nGender\nIQ measures\nPlacement in a beauty contest\nMajor programs\nResponse speed\nSAT scores\nOrder in a race\npercentage\nNominal\nOrdinal\nInterval\nRatio\nWhich scales?\n- Emotion (happy, angry, etc) ?\n- Categories of famous people (singer, actor, politician) ?\n- Caricatures of a face?\n- Level of masculinity?\n- Something is colder than something else?\n- The degree of temperature of the object?\n- Degree of clutter (high to low complexity)?\n- Distance of viewing a scene?\n- Levels of depression?\n- List of your 10 preferred CDs from most to the less?\n- Length of a line?\n- weight?\nNominal\nOrdinal\nInterval\nRatio\nExperimental controls: The most important aspect\nof the validation of an hypothesis\n-\nControl: any means used to rule out threats to the validity of a research.\n-\nResearch often involves the use of a group of subjects who do not\nexperience the manipulation (of your hypothesis)\n-\nControls has two meanings:\n-\n(1) a standard against which to compare the effects of a particular\nindependent variables\n-\n(2) One or more additional conditions allowing to rule out the effect of\nvariables others than the independent variable.\nFigure removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\nControl group\nIQ as an interval factor\nIQ scores are measured on an interval scale since the interval between, say, 85\nand 100 is the same magnitude as the interval between 100 and 115 (i.e., 1\nstandard deviation).\nHowever, a score of 0 on an IQ test does not indicate the complete absence of\nintelligence - there is no absolute zero point\n-\nThe IQs tests are designed so that the\namount of the difference between\npeople can be meaningfully\nrepresented by the IQ score.\n-\nIQ is not a ratio scale: it would be\nmeaningless to say that a person with\nan IQ of 120 is twice as smart as\nsomeone with an IQ of 60\nWhy is that so important?\n- Nominal and ordinal scale have specific statistics:\nnon parametric statistics, based on the rank order of the\ndata or on the sign of the differences between subjects.\n- Interval and ratio scales allow you to perform most\nmathematical operations on them and inferential\nstatistics (parametric statistics: like pearson correlation,\nt-test, ANOVA). Parametric statistics make assumptions\nabout the population from which the data are drawn -\nnamely that the data are normally distributed and each\ngroup has the same (similar) variance\nExperimental vocabulary\n- An experiment can have a control group or a control\ncondition\n- A within-subject experiment: each subject experiences\nevery condition\n- A between-subject experiment: different groups of\nsubjects experience different conditions.\n- A mixed design: some independent variables are\nbetween, others are within.\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nAccident\nMemory construction\nAccident\nMemory construction\nBetween-subject design\n- When different groups\nof subjects are used\n(within-design are not\npossible because of\nLeading question:\nthe possibility of carry-\n\"About how fast were the cars going\nover effects: practice,\nWhen they smashed into each other?\"\nexpertise, learning,\nmemory).\nWhat is a leading Question?\n- A \"leading question\" is a question intended to guide the person\nanswering it toward a particular response. Example: \"Would you\nvote for John Smith, a man who has been known to break campaig\npromises?\"\n- The way a hypothetical question was worded could influence a\nperson's answer to it.\n- A classic experiment (Loftus & Palmer, 1974) showed that leading\nquestions could affect subjects' estimates of car speed after they\nviewed simulated car accidents.\n- This experiment suggested that the leading questions had planted\nlasting 'misinformation' that affected the subjects' later memory of\nthe event.\nn\nThe experiment\n- Participants shown video\n(slides) of an accident\nbetween two cars\n- Two groups will be asked\ndifferent questions\nLeading question:\n- Group 1 : How fast were\n\"About how fast were the cars going\nthe cars going when they\nWhen they smashed into each other?\"\nsmashed into each other?\n- Group 2 : How fast were\nthe cars going when they\nhit each other?\nExperimental vocabulary\n- Control: the technique of producing comparisons\nand holding other variables constant\n- Control condition: the comparison condition in a\nwithin-subjects design; compare to control\ngroup.\n- Control group: the group in a between subjects\nexperiment that receives a comparison level of\nthe independent variable\n- Control variable: a potential independent\nvariable that is held constant in an experiment.\nControl group\nFigures removed due to copyright restrictions.\nFigures removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n9.63 Laboratory in Visual Cognition\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
