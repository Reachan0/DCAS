The beams are expected to carry, in addition to its own weight, a\nservice load of 1500 lb/ft and a dead load of 300 lb/ft from the bituminous\nmaterials on the slabs.

Structural Engineering Design\nBackground and Problem Statement\nSimmons Hall opened to great fanfare\nand controversy in the fall of 2002. As students\ntook up residence in the new dormitory,\ndiscussions around campus centered on two\nprimary questions: was the new dormitory \"a\nnice place to live,\" and was it \"worth the cost.\"\nThese two questions were very related to the\ngoals of MIT when Simmons was under\nconsideration. The quality of life questions are very relevant to the Institute's primary\ngoal of fostering a sense of community throughout the new living group. The cost\nquestion stemmed from MIT's desire for the new building to be architecturally\nsignificant.\nFigure 1: Simmons Hall\nTwo years after the opening of the residence hall, the success of the dormitory in\naccomplishing the goals set forth for it is mixed. Specifically, the structure itself seems\nto have limited success in fostering a sense of community, and the overall quality of life\ndoes not differ significantly from that of other dormitories. In the architectural field,\nSimmons has become fairly well-known because of its unique design and the methods\nused in construction. However, the worth of the building and the benefit/cost analysis\nseems to be a subjective judgment which differs significantly between MIT\nadministration and students.\nSeveral techniques were used in design and construction which were intended to\ncreate a sense of community among the residents of Simmons Hall. For example, the\nwalls of the building are packed with windows, attempting to create a sense of openness\nand light. Each floor has abundant common space, and the commons are linked to other\nfloors by in-room staircases. Finally, the ground floor of the dormitory is devoted to\nshared space, including lounges and dining.\nUnfortunately, many of these efforts seem to be only marginally effective at\naccomplishing the goals set forth. The lounges often sit empty, although some floors do\nuse their space more than others. The dining facility is well used, but anecdotal reports\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nindicate that most people eat with the same groups each night, thereby reducing the\namount of socialization that could occur. The biggest challenge seems to be a failure\nwith the \"openness\" desired by the architect and administration. On a walk through\nSimmons, it quickly becomes apparent that most people stay in their rooms with their\ndoors shut. This nullifies the effect of the many windows, and has a negative impact on\nthe sense of community which could otherwise develop.\nThe cost-effectiveness of Simmons Hall is a less objective issue. The dormitory\nwas enormously expensive to construct, with the cost estimates ranging from $125\nmillion to $300 million (the exact figure is \"confidential\"). Administrators almost\nunanimously support the costs, and President Vest often cites Simmons as being a bold\nstatement and a worthwhile investment in community1. Students, however, have mixed\nopinions.\nFigure 2: A bathroom in\nSimmons Hall\nAs we began to interview students about their\nopinions of Simmons Hall, we found that few students\nagreed on the value of the building. Several consensus\nopinions did emerge, however. The residents of Simmons\nwere generally enthusiastic about the dormitory and liked\nthe facilities. All the residents with whom we talked -\nboth freshmen and upperclassmen - were especially\nsatisfied with the size of the rooms. Also, residents were\nhappy with the number of bathrooms. Many rooms have\npersonal bathrooms or share one between 3 or 4 students.\nHowever, several freshmen remarked that the bathrooms\nwere uncomfortably small.\nResidents of the Hall are also appreciative of the efforts made to foster\ncommunity. Rebecca Idell '07 stated that she likes that the \"lounges are all connected to\na different floor so you can meet people you don't normally see.\" Also, students are\ngenerally satisfied with the amount of shared-study area, and in contrast to the lounges,\nthese study spaces seem to be well used. The kitchen facilities are also popular, and\n1 Cameron, Jay. \"Vest Starts New Year at Convocation.\" The Tech, 26 Aug. 2003, A1.\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nmany students reported that they had cooked for themselves at least occasionally. The\nfirst floor dining hall is also well used, and Idell stated that the communal tables are\nsometimes a good way to meet other residents.\nStudents are ambivalent\nabout the design of the building,\nthough.\nWhile there exists\namong MIT undergraduates a\nconsensus that the building is\nunique, a majority of students\nseem to dislike the appearance.\nMany residents of other MIT\nundergraduate dormitories dislike\nthe\n\"sponge\"\ntheme,\nand\nSeongMin Kim '05 went so far\nas to call the building \"an\neyesore.\" Also, many engineering students questioned the necessity of the cutouts. \"The\nmissing sections seem like they would add a lot to the cost of the building, and have a\nquestionable return on the investment,\" said John Huss '04, referring to the complex\nengineering necessary to support floors via hanging girders and cantilevered beams.\nA general statement to summarize undergraduate opinion about Simmons would\nbe that students like the facilities, but think that similar goals could have been\naccomplished with a more traditional design. \"Simmons Hall is like Burton-Conner, but\nwith a different exterior and a dining hall,\" said Alison Baker '05. Burton-Conner is one\nof MIT's oldest undergraduate dormitories. Simmons Hall may be architecturally\nsignificant, but student opinion seems to suggest that a more traditional design would\nhave been preferred.\nFigure 3: Simmons Hall dining room\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nArchitectural Considerations and Design\nAs the main function of Simmons Hall is act as a dormitory, this had to be the\nfirst consideration during design. It accomplishes this aspect, boasting 350 beds for\nstudents as well as additional beds for visiting professors. In addition to this main task\nthough, it was very important that Simmons not only blend in to the surrounding\ncommunity, but promote community as well. The dormitory has a large emphasis on\nopen space for students to congregate so that they can bond with each other. In addition,\nSimmons has its own dining facilities so that students may eat with each other and feel\nmore at home inside their dorm. Simmons was supposed to blend in with the buildings\naround it, but Simmons has become very well known for sticking out and catching the\neye of passersby.\nThe design is revolutionary in several aspects. Not only is the sponge exterior a\ncompletely unique facade, but the structural integrity of the exterior is also one of a kind.\nMIT was willing to spend money to hire an architect who would deliver a design that\nwould make a lasting impression on all who saw it. The final design can be described at\nporous. The outer membrane is perfcon, with squares cut out to create the sponge effect.\nAlthough this surface may seem to be purely aesthetic, it serves as a load bearing wall\nand it the key support for much of the building. Once all this had been decided upon, the\nbuilding had to be built in time to accommodate the incoming freshmen class. The\nconstruction period was extremely time critical. The design had to incorporate this into\nthe final concept. The perfcon had to be constructed quickly, and the final design for the\nfoundation had just been completed right before construction began.\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nDesign Flow Chart\nGoals\nArchitectural\nConsiderations &\nDetermine Preferred\nSystem\nDevelop\nStructural\nCalculate\nMember\nCalculate Geotech,\nLateral, and Dead Loads\nDetermine Cost &\nConstruction\nStudy\nBuilding\nFeasibility\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nGeotechnical Review\nI: Site Conditions (all data Haley & Aldrich 1999):\nThe site has several distinct layers, as described below in order of increasing\ndepth:\n1. A layer of fill: sand with varying amounts of gravel, brick, and other material,\nranging in depth from 5.5 to 8.5 feet\n2. A layer of organic materials: very loose silt and peat with some sand and\ngravel, ranging in thickness from 0 to 8.5 feet\n3. Medium to very dense, coarse to fine sand and gravelly coarse sand, with\nsome clay and gravel, 13 to 33 feet thick\n4. Very soft to hard silty clay, ranging from 167.5 to 176.5 feet in thickness\n5. Medium to very dense silt, with mixed gravel, sand and clay, 6.5 to 11.5 feet\nthick.\n6. Very dense silty coarse to fine sand, gravelly sand, with some gravel, clay,\nand boulders.\nThe final refusal depth was 224.5 feet.\nOther factors that had to be considered included the water table at 12 feet below grade,\nwhich would require waterproofing of any foundation below that level, and the existence\nof neighboring buildings, roads, and railroad tracks, which would require special\nmeasures to prevent their settling while construction was occurring.\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nII: Original Engineer's Recommendations\nThe Haley & Aldrich report, 1999, made recommendations based on the size of\nthe final building and the depth of basement to be used. A summary:\n1. A tower of 9 to ten stories with a 1.5 story basement could use a concrete mat\n\"floating\" foundation. Resulting differential settlements would be within\ngenerally acceptable limits, an approximate distortion ratio less than 1:450.\n2. Taller towers, greater than ten stories, would require successively deeper\nexcavations to allow create a raft situation.\n3. Towers greater than 20 stories in height would require end bearing piles. Site\nconditions indicate that end bearing piles would have to extend approximately\n200 feet below grade, but significantly more site exploration would need to be\nperformed to confirm the exact design of piles.\nIII: Final Design\nThe final design uses a 10 story tower with roughly 1.5 basement levels. It is\nbased on a 4 foot thick slab foundation.\nThe weight of the soil excavated is\napproximately equal to the final weight of the building, so a \"mat\" situation is created\nwith virtually no settling (after allowing for \"heave\" during excavation and the small\nsettling that follows).\nIV: Construction Procedures\nBecause the foundation extended below the water table, much of it required\nspecial waterproofing. During construction de-watering wells were used to keep the site\nclear. Extra deep pads below the elevator shafts specifically required constant de\nwatering.\nThe excavation site was surrounded by sheet piles driven below the excavation\nlevel. These piles were braced both diagonally in the corners and horizontally across the\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nlot's shorter dimension using large steel beams. These measures prevented any\nsignificant settling around the neighboring railroad tracks and road during construction.\nV: Possible Alternate Geotechnical Designs\nThere are three major types of foundations available: spread foundations using\nslabs or footings, pile foundations, and pier foundations. In general spread foundations\nwill be the most economical when they meet design requirements, because they don't\nrequire very deep excavations or driving of piles (Huntington, 42).\nIn this case, for the required building size it was possible to use a spread\nfoundation, specifically a mat or \"raft\" foundation. Because site conditions would\nrequire end bearing piles to be approximately 200 feet in depth (extremely deep), costs\nassociated with construction and driving of piles would be extremely large. The\nexcavation and large slab required by the mat foundation are comparatively cheap and\neasy.\nIn the event that building design were to call for a building of greater than 20\nstories (or if different loading conditions, say a heavy manufacturing plant on the same\nlocation that created the same loading conditions) end bearing piles would be necessary.\nWith the current building design using 20 bays horizontally and 3 vertically, there are 84\npoints where columns contact the foundation. Using combined footings to connect some\nof these columns, the number of points at which piles would be driven could probably be\nreduced to approximately twenty. Because pile foundations require at least three piles\nper foundation to ensure stability (Huntington 43), approximately sixty piles would have\nto be driven to a depth of near 200 feet. Piles of this length are very near the limits of\nwhat can be done with available technology.\nThough construction of a pile foundation on the site for a building greater than 20\nstories in height would not be unprecedented, it would almost certainly not be\neconomically viable. The resulting costs and increased construction time would be high\nenough that we can essentially assume the building should be limited to 20 stories\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nmaximum, and that an appropriately deep basement to create a \"raft\" situation is a design\nrequirement.\nThe final building as constructed required relatively large excavation, and an\nextremely large foundation slab, but this method appears to be much more efficient than\nany alternatives available, largely due to the soil conditions on site.\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nPerforated Concrete (Perfcon):\nBackground\nThe exterior skin of Simmons Hall has a unique appearance, but the \"sponge\nlook\" is special for reasons other than just how it looks. Simmons Hall was designed\nwith an exterior of perforated concrete. This material, commonly referred to as\n\"perfcon,\" is fabricated of reinforced concrete and plays a crucial role in the support of\ngravitational loads in a structure. In the design of Simmons Hall, the vertical members of\nperfcon act as columns, each one supporting a small faction of the load.\nArchitectural considerations played a primary role in the use of perfcon on the\noutside of Simmons Hall. The many slender columns and the equally spaced horizontal\nmembers allowed the exterior of Simmons to be packed with windows: approximately\n6,000 in all. Also, the inclusion of reinforced concrete members in the exterior shell\nmeant that massive columns were not necessary along the exterior edges of the building.\nAccordingly, perfcon functioned as a load bearing shell and exterior of the dormitory.\nHowever, because Simmons was one of the first buildings to use perfcon as load\nbearing members, it was difficult to find a\nmanufacturing firm willing to build the perfcon\nsegments. In the end, only one precasting\ncontractor was willing to complete the job. The\nmanufacturing process was difficult not only\nbecause of the complexity of each section, but\nalso because of the precision necessary to\nensure the sections were of appropriate strength.\nIn addition, large amounts of reinforcing steel\nwere necessary to provide tension strength because of the irregular design.\nsections\nFigure 4: Construction of perfcon\nConstruction and erection of the perfcon sections also proved to be difficult and\nexpensive.\nBecause construction crews had little experience with the techniques\nnecessary to build with perfcon, a mock up was constructed and tested to ensure that the\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\ntechnique would produce adequate results. This mock-up was necessary, but it added\ntime and expense to the overall design of the dormitory.\nThe joints between the sections of\nperfcon\nwere\nespecially\ndifficult\nto\nconstruct. Joints between the sections\nwere designed to an extremely high\nstrength specification so that the members\nthemselves would yield before the joints\ndid. This strength was accomplished in\nvertical members by using spliced sleeve\njoints with 1-inch dry-packed grout. For\nhorizontal couplings, wet joints and bar-\nlock couplers were used.\nFigure 5: Erection of perfcon mock-up\nAlthough the joints were very strong, this strength came at a high price. The\njoining method itself was very expensive, but also required a large number of engineer-\nhours to oversee the joining process. Construction crews were unused to the joint\nmethods, so an engineer had to personally supervise and direct the creation of all joints\nbetween each of the 290 panels. Other high costs as a result of perfcon included the\ntransportation of each section from the manufacturing plants to the construction site.\nFinally, quality control was closely monitored throughout the entire process. The\nmanufacturer was held to a high standard of precision, which was ensured through spot-\nchecks and mock-ups. The joints were each supervised by engineers, which helped to\nmaintain the expected level of quality.\nJoint Performance\nJoints between perfcon sections were designed to be stronger than the perfcon\nmembers themselves. This design choice was made because the joints were considered to\nbe more vulnerable than the members. Also, if the members were designed to support the\nnecessary loads, and the strength of the joints exceeded that of the members, the shell of\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nSimmons would be very structurally sound. This choice also makes sense because it is\neasier to control the strength of pre-fabricated concrete than to control the strength of\ncast-in-place joints.\nThe strong joints proved to be very\nexpensive because they used a great deal of steel.\nOver-designing the joints significantly increased the\ncost of construction, and the engineering hours\nrequired to make connections between the sections\nwas very expensive.\nHowever, the joints did\nsupport the appropriate loads in compression tests.\nj\nFigure 6: Inspection of Perfcon section\noints\nAlternative Approach\nAn alternative to the load-bearing perfcon could have the majority of the\ngravitational loads supported by columns in the core of the building. The exterior of the\nbuilding would be strong enough to resist wind forces, and would provide shear support,\nbut would not bear as much of the gravitational load as the current system does. The\nsame architectural effect and abundance of windows could be achieved through a steel\nand aluminum facade.\nThis approach would reduce the amount of reinforcement needed in the perfcon\nwalls, which would result in more economical construction budgets. Also, the joints\nbetween the exterior sections would be less crucial, resulting in fewer engineering hours\nand a more efficient construction schedule. The beams and columns that would support\nthat majority of the gravitational loads could be cast-in-place concrete, which would\nreduce transportation costs. Also, using a more traditional load-bearing support structure\nwould make procurement of the necessary members easier because the construction\nteams would not be reliant on only one supplier. Finally, this alternative would allow\nmore open space for utilities in the exterior of the building.\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nLoad Calculation\nWind and Earthquake Loads -\nHeight (ft)\nWind Load (kips)\nEarthquake Load (kips)\n4.42\n2.14\n4.3\n2.75\n4.22\n2.36\n4.06\n1.98\n3.92\n1.62\n3.78\n1.28\n3.6\n.958\n3.38\n.659\n3.04\n.389\n2.92\n.158\nLive Loads -\nThe calculation of the live loads was carried out in the following manner.

All of these load resisting components are\nplaced within the structural system in such a way so as to allow for the desired\narchitectural considerations. These considerations are for the exterior shell to be pierced\nwith many small openings as well as a few larger openings, open atrium spaces within the\nbuilding, and as much uninterrupted room and lounge space as possible.\nLoad path of Simmons is somewhat unique due to the existence of the perfcon\nthat surrounds the building. The perfcon is able to resist lateral loads much better than a\nweak facade, but the loads are still distributed through the building to the inner rows of\nvertical supports. These supports work with the perfcon to dissipate the effects of the\nforces. Gravity loads run from the concrete slabs that make up the floor to the beams that\nsupport the edges of these slabs. From the beams, the loads are transferred either out to\nthe exterior walls that are made of perfcon, or to one of the central rows of columns that\nruns through the building. The perfcon and columns both transfer the loads down and\ninto the ground.\nPerfcon was specially designed and formed in precast sections able to perform\nstructurally, even though the sections are pierced with multiple openings for windows.\nThe perfcon itself serves to resist the majority of the wind loads because its stiffness and\ncontinuity allows it to resist the lateral loads as they are applied to it. The perfcon also\nsupports a large percentage of the gravity loads as well. A load applied to the floor is\ntransferred along the floor slab to the perfcon on the outer edge and then down to the\nground. The perfcon allows for large atrium openings throughout the building because\nthe majority of the weight is in a sense cantilevered out from the exterior walls and not\nsupported by columns placed at frequent intervals.\nThe columns that are incorporated into Simmons are placed in two rows along the\nlength of the building. This works very well because some sort of internal vertical\nsupport is needed, however when placed in this way, the columns run along the walls of\nthe central corridor allowing them to avoid interrupting any open spaces.\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nApproximate Analysis\nApproximate Analysis was carried out on the top two floors of Simmons. Since\nthe wind loads dominate the earthquake loads, and there is no load combination for the\ntwo, the approximate analysis was done using wind, live, and dead loads only. The\nanalysis was only done on the narrower of the two cross sections because this direction is\nless stable and we must design for the weakest scenario. It was approximated to simply\nbe a system of beams and columns, neglecting the slabs that exist in the structure. Again,\nthis was done to simplify the calculations. The only effect it will have on our\ncalculations is to make them more conservative since the weight of the slabs is taken into\naccount as dead load in the analysis while the stiffening properties are left out.

Not only do the Perfcon elements\nmake up the exterior facade of the building, but they also serve as the main support\nsystem for the structure. Building Simmons in this fashion greatly added to the overall\ncost of construction because these elements had to be made of precast concrete so that\nthey would be able to withstand the necessary loading conditions. Our suggestion for an\nalternative structural system reduces these construction costs, by eliminating the need for\nthe Perfcon to serve a significant structural purpose. This structural system involves\ncantilevering the floors off of five central cores that will also serve as the elevator shafts,\none running up the center of each tower, and two rising between the towers. If it is\ndetermined necessary, trusses can also be cantilevered off of existing stairways. This\nstructural system has been used previously to construct the IBM Building as well as New\nYork's World Trade Center. Shown below is a diagram of the World Trade Center that\ndepicts the layout of the trusses that are cantilevered from the central core to support each\nfloor (left). Also below is a close up that cuts through a floor to illustrate the trusses used\nand the layers involved in connecting the trusses to form a cohesive floor (right).\nFigure 29: Truss Layers\nFigure 28: WTC Truss Layout\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nBy having the elevator cores, and possibly stairways, take 80% of the\ngravitational loads, there will be many beneficial consequences to the building other than\nsimply reducing construction costs. The first of these benefits is that there is no need for\nany interior load bearing columns. This means that the architect will have much more\nfreedom to develop the interior of the building with large open areas. Since it was\nimportant to the architect for the exterior of the building to be composed of many small\nwindows, this can still be accomplished. However, this will now be done with a concrete\nfacade which could be constructed much more readily than when major loading\nconditions had to be considered. Constructing this outer concrete shell with cast in place\nconcrete, instead of precast concrete, greatly reduces both the construction cost and the\nconstruction time.\nThe main purpose of this facade will be to act as wind bracing for the building,\nalthough it will also be responsible for carrying up to 20% of gravity loads. The floors\nwill be cantilevered off of the load bearing cores using prefabricated trusses. This\nmethod allows for the trusses to be constructed off site, and then transported to the site\nand immediately incorporated into the building. This will reduce construction time\nimmensely. These trusses extending from the cores to the exterior facade will also serve\nas bracing for the facade to increase its ability to resist lateral loads. In order to assure\nthe distribution of forces is more on the core columns, the trusses will be connected to the\ninterior columns with a welded moment connection, and only simply supported on the\nexterior end.\nFigure 30: Sample Truss Connection\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nLoad Path\nThe major difference between our alternate structure and the existing Simmons\nstructure is that our alternate structure is based on the idea of the core columns taking the\nmajority of the loads and the existing structure is built so that the exterior shell can\nsupport as much of the loads as possible. In the case of our alternate structure, lateral\nloads are mainly resisted by the exterior facade, just as in the existing structure. They are\nsufficiently anchored to the ground, and are stiffened by the lateral trusses to such a\ndegree that they can deflect most of the wind and earthquake loads.\nThe gravity loads are transferred from the floors to the frequently spaced steel\ntrusses. These trusses then transfer the loads either to the larger, less frequently spaced,\ntrusses, which then transfer the load to the core columns, or the smaller trusses transfer\nthe load directly to the core columns.\nFigure 31: Frame Deformations\nFigure 32: Frame Deformations\nunder Gravity, Wind, and\nunder Gravity Loads\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nFigure 33: Shear Forces for\nFigure 34: Critical Bending\nAlternate Structure\nMoments for Alternate Structure\nFigure 35: Shear Forces for Alternate Structure close up of lower three\nfloors.\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nFigure 36: Moment Diagram for Alternate Structure (close up of lower\nthree floors)\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nAlternative Supports for Group 3 Specific Sections\nSeveral alternative structural designs for areas 3a and 3b were developed on a\nconceptual level. Each of these is briefly described with an approximate graphical\nrepresentation below.\nFigure 37: Specific group assignments for section design\nThe regions our group needs to analyze are sections 3a and 3b.\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nSection 3a\nFigure 38: Existing Section 3a\nFigure 39: Alternative Design, Section 3a\nSection 3a occurs in the eastern wing of Simmons Hall. It is a space over a cutout\nin the building, and prevents direct support from either perfcon or a column/slab design.\nSection 3a alternative includes large, reinforced columns on either side of the cutout. The\nfloors above the cutout would be supported by the two large columns, and beams would\nrun between the columns to support the floor slabs. This alternative would be bulky and\nunnecessary with our overall design of Simmons.\nFor Section 3a, design calculations were performed for alternative 1. This was\nthe design of two steel beams used to bridge the large two-bay width gaps that are related\nto Section 3a. The lower of the two beams is required to support an evenly distributed\nload, while the upper beam is designed to also support two large point loads created by\ncolumns supporting upper floors. The re-design of this upper beam is an alternative to\nthe system currently used, whereby this floor is actually hung from the floors above it.\nThis floor now supports the floors above it.\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nSection 3b\nSection 3b occurs between the 6th and 7th floors of Simmons Hall, and is the bottom\ncorner of another cutout. The main design difficulty here is that a column rises to the 7th\nfloor and above, but is centered between two separate columns rising from the ground.\nFigure 40: Existing Section 3b\nFigure 41: Alternative Design, Section 3b\nFor Section 3b, design calculations were performed for alternative 2. This was\nthe design of a single steel beam over a standard bay width supporting both the usual\ndistributed load and a large point load resulting from the non-standard bay spacing above\nthe area.\nFinal beam design calculations and member selections are shown in appendix G.\nMajor sections of the process included:\n1. Estimation of distributed and point loads\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\n2.

Calculation of required section properties based on maximum moments and\ndeflection. Shear calculations were not performed because it is known that\nshear will limit only in extremely short beams. Applying intuition to the\nrequired section properties indicates that deflection, in the form of I required,\nwill almost certainly be the limiting factor in member selection.\n4. Final member selection yielded two reasonably economical choices for each\nbeam. In each case a slightly deeper beam would allow lower weight (and\ntherefore cost), while a less deep beam would have higher weight (and\ntherefore be more costly). In each case the thinner beam was selected because\nthe small increase in cost due to weight was outweighed by the aesthetic and\npractical gains of a thinner section.\nThe alternative methods described here require only minimal modification to the\ncolumns in the area, so a detailed column re-design was not performed. The only major\nchange necessary will be in connection details because the standard CIP concrete\ncolumns and beams are not designed to interface directly with large steel members.\nAlternative Structural Systems for Simmons Hall\nBaker, Fowler, French, Soetjipto, Wayman\n\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n1.051 - Structural Engineering Design\nBibliography\nHaley & Aldrich, Inc.

      "content": "1.051 Structural Engineering Design\n\nProf. Oral Buyukozturk\n\nFall 2003\n\n1.051 Structural Engineering Design\n\nRecitation 1\n\nCALCULATION OF WIND AND EARTHQUAKE LOADS ON STRUCTURES\nACCORDING TO ASCE 7 & IBC\n\nWIND LOADS\n\nBuildings and their components are to be designed to withstand the code-specified wind\nloads. Calculating wind loads is important in design of the wind force-resisting system,\nincluding structural members, components, and cladding, against shear, sliding,\noverturning, and uplift actions.\n\nWind Load Calculation Procedures\n\nThe design wind loads for buildings and other structures shall be determined according to\none of the following procedures:\n\n(1) Method 1 - Simplified procedure for low-rise simple diaphragm buildings\n(2) Method 2 - Analytical procedure for regular shaped building and structures\n(3) Method 3 - Wind tunnel procedure for geometrically complex buildings and\nstructures\n\nMethod 1 - Simplified Procedure\n\nThe simplified procedure is used for determining and applying wind pressures in the\ndesign of simple diaphragm buildings with flat, gabled, and hipped roofs and having a\nmean roof height not exceeding the least horizontal dimension or 60 feet (18.3 m),\nwhichever is less, and subject to additional limitations.\n\nFollowing are the steps of the simplified procedure:\n\n1. Determined the basic wind speed, V, in accordance with ASCE 7 Figure 6-1 or IBC\nFigure 1609, assuming the wind can come from any direction. ASCE 7 6.5.4 includes\nsome provisions for the special wind regions indicated, near mountainous terrain, and\nnear gorges.\n2. Determine the importance factor, I, in accordance with ASCE 7 Table 6-1 & Table 1-\n1, or with IBC Table 1604.5.\n3. Determine the exposure category in accordance with ASCE 7 Section 6.5.6 or IBC\nSection 1609.4.\n4. Determine the height and exposure adjustment coefficient, λ, from ASCE 7 Figure 6-\n2 or IBC Table 1609.6.2.1 (4)\n5. Determine\nSp\n, the simplified wind pressure for exposure B, at h=30 ft, for I=1.0,\nfrom ASCE 7 Figure 6-2 or IBC Table 1609.6.2.1.\n\n1.051 Structural Engineering Design\n\nProf. Oral Buyukozturk\n\nFall 2003\nSimplified design wind pressures, pS, for the main wind force resisting systems of low-\nrise simple diaphragm buildings is determined by the following equation:\n\nS\nS\np\nIp\nλ\n=\n\n(1)\n\nwhere pS represents the net pressure (sum of internal and external) to be applied to the\nhorizontal and vertical projections of building surfaces. For the horizontal pressures, pS is\nthe combination of the windward and leeward net pressures.\n\nMethod 2 - Analytical Procedure\n\nWind loads for buildings and structures that do not satisfy the conditions for using the\nsimplified procedure can be calculated using the analytical procedure provided that it is a\nregular shaped building or structure, and it does not have response characteristics making\nit subject to across-wind loading, vortex shedding, instability due to galloping or flutter,\nor does not have a site location that require special consideration.\n\nThe steps of analytical procedure, described in ASCE 7 Section 6.5.3 only, are as\nfollows:\n\n1. Determine the basic wind speed, V, and wind directionality factor, Kd in accordance\nwith ASCE 7 Section 6.5.4.\n2. Determine the importance factor, I, in accordance with ASCE Section 6.5.5.\n3. Determine the exposure category or exposure categories and velocity pressure\nexposure coefficient, Kz or Kh, as applicable, for each wind direction according to\nASCE 7 Section 6.5.6.\n4. Determine the topographic factor, Kzt, if applicable, according to ASCE 7 Section\n6.5.7.\n5. Determine the gust effect factor G or Gf, as applicable, in accordance with ASCE 7\nSection 6.5.8.\n6. Determine the enclosure classification in accordance with Section 6.5.9.\n7. Determine the internal pressure coefficient, GCpi in accordance with ASCE 7 Section\n6.5.11.1.\n8. Determine the external pressure coefficients, Cp or GCpf, or force coefficients, Cf, as\napplicable, in accordance with ASCE 7 Section 6.5.11.2 or 6.5.11.3.\n9. Determine the velocity pressure, qz or qh, as applicable, in accordance with ASCE 7\nSection 6.5.10. The velocity pressure, qz evaluated at height z is calculated by the\nfollowing equation:\n\n(2)\n0.00256\n\n(lb/ft )\n0.613\n\n(N/m ; V in m/s)\nz\nz\nzt\nd\nz\nz\nzt\nd\nq\nK K K V I\nq\nK K K V I\n=\n=\n\n10.

Special structures including vehicular bridges,\ntransmission towers, piers and wharves, hydraulic structures, and nuclear reactors are\nbeyond the scope of these provisions.\n\nThe process of determining earthquake loads can be broken down to following basic\nsteps:\n\n(a) determining the maximum considered earthquake and design spectral response\naccelerations\n(b) determining the seismic base shear in conjunction with the building or structure's\ndynamic characteristics (e.g. fundamental period)\n(c) distribution of the seismic base shear within the building or structure\n\nGeneral Procedure for Determining Maximum Considered Earthquake and Design\nSpectral Response Accelerations\n\nGround motion accelerations, represented by response spectra and coefficients derived\nfrom these spectra, shall be determined in accordance with:\n\n- the general procedure described in ASCE 7 Section 9.4.12 or IBC Section 1615.1\n- the site-specific procedure described in ASCE 7 Section 9.4.1.3 or IBC Section\n1615.2.\n\nConditions on use of these methods depend on the seismic use group and site\ncharacteristics of the building or structure.\n\nThe procedure for determining the design spectral response accelerations is as follows:\n\n1. Determine the mapped maximum considered earthquake spectral response\naccelerations at short periods, Ss and at 1-second period, S1 using the spectral\nacceleration maps in ASCE 7 Figure 9.4.1.1a through 9.4.1.1j or IBC Figures 1615(1)\nthrough (10). Straight-line interpolation is allowed for sites in between contours.\nAcceleration values obtained from the maps are given in %g, where g is the\ngravitational acceleration.\n2. Determine the site class in accordance with ASCE Section 9.4.1.2.1 or IBC 1615.1.1.\nSite class (A, B, C, D, E or F) is obtained based on the average shear wave velocity,\nvs, average standart penetration resistance, N, or the average undrained shear strength,\nSu. These parameters represent average values for the top 100 ft (30 m) of soil.\n\n1.051 Structural Engineering Design\n\nProf. Oral Buyukozturk\n\nFall 2003\n3. Determine the maximum considered earthquake spectral response accelerations,\nadjusted for Site Class effects, at short period, SMS, and at 1-second period, SM1, in\naccordance with ASCE Section 9.4.1.2.4 or IBC 1615.1.2.\n4.

Frame structures are by far the most commonly encountered structural\nsystems in design. Beam loadings mostly rely on loads transferred from slabs being\nsupported and such loads are dependent on the type of occupancy. For instance, the\nservice load of an office floor would be much less than that of a machine room. Also,\nweights of construction materials also contribute significantly in most cases. Self-weight\nof the beam under consideration is normally required.\n\n1.051 Structural Engineering Design\n\nFall 2003\nProf. Oral Buyukozturk\n\nDesign of Beams for Flexure\n\nSection design is an iterative process as (1) the section size is, in most cases, not yet\ndetermined, self-weight (DL) of the beam need to be updated with the section size, and\n(2) the initially assumed section size may not meet the required capacity and need to be\nredesigned. The following presents a general design procedure:\n\n1.\nDetermine the service loads\n2.\nAssume h and estimate b by the rule of thumb of effective section (dimensions\nshould satisfy architectural requirements, if any)\n3.\nCheck minimum thickness of beam according to Table 9.5(a) in the code\n4.\nEstimate self weight\n5.\nDetermine initial dead loads\n6.\nPerform preliminary elastic analysis {Plot bending moment diagram (BMD) +\nshear force diagram (SFD)}; Choose the largest moment and shear values from\nthe BMD and SFD for design\n7.\nCompute ρmin and ρ b\n8.\nChoose a ρ that satisfies Equation (4)\n9.\nCompute bd2 from Equation (2) and compare to the assumed bd2 used for self\nweight estimation\n10. If the assumed bd2 is larger than the computed (required) bd2, and that the\nvalues are not too different, go to Step 11 for steel provision design. Otherwise,\ngo to Step 2 using the computed bd2 value as the assumed value and reiterate the\ndesign procedure until the difference becomes small.\n11. With the chosen ρ, b, d, and Equation (3), determine the total As required.\n12. Design the steel reinforcement arrangement with appropriate concrete covers\nand spacing stipulated in the code. Bar size and the corresponding number of\nbars for the determined As can be found in typical design aids or computed\naccurately based on the knowledge that bar size #n = n/8 inch diameter for\nn<10. Spacing between bars should be greater than 1 in. or one bar diameter,\nwhichever is larger\n13. Sketch the section with the designed rebar arrangements\n14. Check crack widths by Equation (7)\n15. Calculate deflections and check with Table 9.5(b) in the code.\n16. Design Completed\n\nThe above design guideline is mostly applicable to rectangular singly reinforced R.C.\nbeams only. If the design involves other complicated section shapes and/or doubly\nreinforcement provisions, this procedure will need slight modifications.\n\n1.051 Structural Engineering Design\n\nFall 2003\nProf. Oral Buyukozturk\n\nDesign of Beams for Flexure\n\nSome Useful Rules of Thumb:\n-\n0.2\n~\n5.1\nb\nd =\nfor beam spans of 15 ~ 25 feet\n-\n0.4\n~\n0.3\nb\nd =\nfor beam spans > 25 feet\n-\nLarger the b\nd , the more efficient is the section due to less deflection\n-\nFor initial estimation, h - d = 2.5\"\n-\nh should be rounded to the nearest whole number\n-\nb is taken as an even number\n\nThese rules of thumb are very commonly used in practice.

This provision recognizes that a crack\nadjacent to a support whose reaction induces compression into a beam will have a\nhorizontal projection of at least d in; therefore the maximum shear force that must be\ntransmitted across the potential failure plane closest to the support will be equal to the\nreaction reduced by any external forces applied to the beam within a distance d of the\nsupport. If a support does not introduce compression into a member, the critical section\nfor shear should be taken at the face of the support. For this situation the state of stress in\nthe joint should also be studied to determine whether special reinforcement is required. If\na concentrated load is applied to a beam between the support and the critical section at d,\nthe design is also based on the magnitude of the shear at the face of the support."

Since most structural frames are braced, secondary\nmoments will usually be small and can be neglected in the design of most columns.\nThat's also the reason why short column design is emphasized in this course.\n\nA Note on Short Column Design\nFor columns that are components of rigid-jointed structures, the analysis and design are\ninter-related. Since the distribution of forces in an indeterminate structure depends on the\nrelative stiffness of the members, the dimensions of members must be estimated before\nthe structure can be analyzed. After both the axial load and the maximum moment in the\ncolumn due to factored loads are determined, the reinforcement is selected. If the area of\n\n1.051 Structural Engineering Design\nProf. Oral Buyukozturk\n\nFall 2003\n\nsteel falls within the 1 - 8 percent limits established by the ACI-318, the design is\ncomplete, otherwise, the dimensions must be readjusted and the analysis and design\nrepeated.\n\nACI Clause 10.10.1 indicates an analysis is acceptable if the difference between the\nassumed dimensions and the final dimensions does not exceed 10 percent. For instance, if\na designer initially assumes a column with 10\" square section in a particular location in a\nbuilding frame will be adequate to carry floor loads, but the calculated loads from the\nanalysis indicate a 12\" section is required, the designer must repeat the analysis using the\nproperties of the larger section.\n\nFor most building frames, small changes in column dimensions do not produce\nsignificant changes in the column forces; there, an acceptable column section can usually\nbe established in one or two trials. To complete the design, the ties or spirals enclosing\nthe steel are sized and the shear strength of the cross section checked. Shear forces are\ntypically small in interior columns, but may be substantial in exterior columns bent into\ndouble curvature.\n\nDesign Methods\n1.\nInteraction Diagrams (Square or circular sections)\n2.\nTrial Method (All sections)\n\n1.\nInteraction Diagrams\nThe dimensions of a column cross section and the required area of reinforcement required\nto support a specific combination of axial load and moment due to factored loads can be\nquickly established by using interaction curve handbooks. Some examples are given in\nthe Appendix. Both tied and spiral columns with common patterns of reinforcements are\nusually contained. To permit these interaction curves to be used for cross sections of any\ndimension, the ordinates are plotted in terms of\ng\nn\nA\nP\nΦ\nand the abscissas in terms of\nh\nA\nM\n\nor\n\nh\nA\ne\nP\ng\nn\ng\nn\n⋅\nΦ\n⋅\n⋅\nΦ\n.\n\nStep 1:\nSelect the properties of the materials\nand f\n'\ncf\ny and the parameter γ, a function\nof the distance between rows of reinforcement. Select a trial area Ag.\n\nStep 2:\nDetermine the appropriate design aid (interaction curve).\n\nStep 3:\nCompute the coordinates required to enter the design aid.\n\nThe section axial strength\nnP\nΦ\nis set equal to Pu; e is computed by Mu/Pu.\n\n1.051 Structural Engineering Design\nProf. Oral Buyukozturk\n\nFall 2003\n\nStep 4:\nRead the required value of the reinforcement ratio ρg from the curve that lies\nat the intersect of the coordinates.\n\nStep 5:\nCompute the total area of steel, Ast, from\ng\ng\nst\nA\nρ\nA\n=\n.\n\nStep 6:\nSelect bars, check clearances, and size ties or spirals to complete design.\n\n2.\nTrial Method\nWhen an interaction curve is not available because a cross section has an unusual shape\nor a nonstandard pattern of reinforcement, cross sections can be designed by a method of\ntrials. The procedure is set forth below:\n\nStep 1:\nSelect a trial section and analyze the structure to establish the design forces Pu\nand Mu produced by factored service loads. An approximate trial area can be\nestablished by dividing Pu by 0.5\nwhen the eccentricity does not exceed half\nthe depth of the section. For larger eccentricities use 0.3 to 0.4\n.\n'\ncf\n'\ncf\n\nStep 2:\nEstablish a reinforcement pattern. The area of steel Ast might be taken initially\nas 3 or 4 percent of the gross area of the cross section.\n\nStep 3:\nCompute the eccentricity of the axial force\nu\nu\nP\nM\ne =\n\nStep 4:\nGuess a strain distribution associated with failure, compute the internal forces,\nand solve for Pn and Mn using vertical and moment equilibriums.\n\nStep 5:\nCompute\nu\nu\nP\nM\ne =\nand\nnP\nΦ\n. If Pu <\nnP\nΦ\nand the eccentricity of Pn is equal to\nor slightly greater than the eccentricity of Pu, the cross section is adequate. If a\nlarger difference in eccentricity exists between Pu and Pn, modify the strain\ndistribution and repeat the analysis. If the axial strength of the section\nis\ntoo large or too small, modify the cross section by changing the area of steel\nor the dimensions, and repeat the analysis and design.\nnP\nΦ\n\n1.051 Structural Engineering Design\nProf. Oral Buyukozturk\n\nFall 2003\n\nDesign of Spirals and Ties\nA.\nSpiral\n-\nBar size ≥ #3\n-\nClear spacing 3\"\nS\n1\"\n≥\n≥\n\nB.\nTies\n-\nBar size ≥ #3 if longitudinal bars ≤ #10\n-\nBar size ≥ #4 if the otherwise including bundled bars\n-\nSpacing\nthe smallest of the following:\n≤\na)\n)\ndiameter\n\nbar\n\nal\nlongitudin\n(\n\nb)\n)\ndiameter\n\ntie\n(\nc) Least dimension of the section, b\n-\nEvery corner and alternate longitudinal bar has lateral support provided by the\ncorner of a tie having an included angle of not more than 135 degree\n-\nNo bar shall be farther than 6\" clear on either side from such a laterally supported\nbar\n\nRules of Thumb\n-\ng\nst\nA\n%\n\nA\n⋅\n≥\nas always, to provide ductility, reduce creep and shrinkage,\nensure some bending strength due to accidental eccentricity\n-\ng\nst\nA\n%\n\nA\n⋅\n≤\nfor sufficient space for concrete flow between bars during casting\n-\nUse bundled bars if\ng\nst\ng\nA\n%\n\nA\n\nA\n%\n⋅\n≤\n≤\n⋅\nto prevent honeycomb and voids\nthat would reduce column strength significantly\n-\nBar spacing need to be greater than 1.5*(bar diameter) or 1.5\" whichever is\ngreater\n-\nCover need to be greater than 1.5\" for interior exposure; 2.0\" for exterior\nexposure\n-\nUse minimum section dimension ≥ 10\" for construction clearance"

The governing design tensile strength is the smaller\nvalue obtained from the three cases. Note that the nominal strength is multiplied by its\nrespective strength reduction factor. In other words, the controlling case can be either (a)\nyielding in the gross section, or (b) tensile fracture in the net section, or (c) block shear\nrupture in the connection region. The nominal strengths, or resistances, and their\nrespective strength reduction factors of a tensile member for the three failure modes are\npresented below.\n\nA.\nYielding Failure\nFor yielding in the gross section,\n9.0\nt =\nΦ\n\ng\ny\nn\nA\nF\nP\n⋅\n=\n\nLRFD Eq.(D1-1)\n\nwhere\n= specified minimum yield stress (ksi)\nyF\n\n= gross area of the member (in.\ng\nA\n2)\n\n1.051 Structural Engineering Design\nProf. Oral Buyukozturk\n\nFall 2003\n\nB.\nFracture Failure\n\nFor fracture in the net section,\n.0\nt =\nΦ\n\ne\nu\nn\nA\nF\nP\n⋅\n=\n\nLRFD Eq.(D1-2)\n\nwhere\n= specified minimum tensile stress (ksi)\nuF\n\n= effective net area (in.\ne\nA\n2)\n\nC.\nBlock Shear Failure\nFor block shear rupture,\n.0\nt =\nΦ\n.
