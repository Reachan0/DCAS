Due on Wednesday Feb. 22, 2012\nUseful quantities are: e2\nħc =\nħ\n137, c = 197 MeV fm.\nProblem 1:\nNuclear physics nomenclature\nAssume we have 147 neutrons and 95 protons in a box, and want to form some nuclides.\na) If we combine all the nucleons, what are N, Z and A of the nuclide we obtain? What is its symbol?\nb) Now we use some of the nucleons to form an alpha particle and the rest to form a second nuclide X. What is this\nnuclide? (state its N, Z and A numbers as well as the symbol).\nc) We now form one nucleus with 4 protons and 4 neutrons and use the rest of the nucleons to form a second nuclide.\nWhat are the two nuclides? (state their N, Z and A numbers as well as the symbols).\nProblem 2:\nNuclear Binding Energy\na) When we put together the nucleons to form the nuclides we considered in Problem 1: some energy is usually gained.\nThis energy is the binding energy of each nuclide. Compute the total binding energy and binding energy per nucleon\nusing both the measured data and the semi-empirical mass formula for the 5 nuclides considered in Problem 1:.\nb) What is the most favorable combination of nuclides, a) b) or c)?\nProblem 3:\nCoulomb potential energy\nConsider the two possible combinations of nuclide in Problem 1: b) and c). To compare their energies to the bound\nstate in Problem 1: a) we should consider not only the binding energy but also the Coulomb interaction between the two\nnuclides in each combination. In case b) for example, the alpha particle interacts with the nuclide X via the Coulomb\ninteraction. To simplify the calculation, we assume both nuclides to be point particles at a distance d = Rα + RX of\neach other, where Ri ≈1.25 × A1/3\ni\nis the nucleus radius.\na) What is the Coulomb potential energy (in MeV ) between each pair of nuclides considered in Problem 1: b) and c)?\n[Note: we will study in the following that this Coulomb repulsion is very important in determining e.g., if a nuclide\nwill decay emitting an alpha particle]\nProblem 4:\nOperators\nWe have seen in the lectures some examples of quantum mechanical operators. For example in 1D we have the\n1. Position operator xˆ, xˆ[φ(x)] = xφ(x).\n2. Momentum operator pˆ = -i\nd\nħ\nx\ndx\n3. Energy operator for a free particle: H = -\nħ\nd2\n2m dx2\nOther examples of operators are the following:\n\n4. I, Identity operator: I[φ(x)] = φ(x) (it leaves the function unchanged)\n5. F, multiplication by the function F(x): F[φ(x)] = F(x)φ(x)\n6. A, annihilation operator: A[φ(x)] = 0\n7. B, division by the number 21: B[φ(x)] =\n21φ(x)\n8. C, operator that changes any function φ(x) to the number 33: C[φ(x)] = 33\na) For all of the eight operators O above, f nd:\n(i) The square of the operators, O2 [e.g. xˆ2[φ(x)] = x2φ(x)]\n(ii) The inverse of the operators (when existing). The inverse of an operator O-1 is such that for any function φ the\noperator is applied to we have\nO-1Oφ(x) = OO-1φ(x) = Iφ(x) = φ(x).\nFor example, xˆ-1[φ(x)] = 1 φ(x) which exists only for x = 0.\nx\nb) An operator is linear if O[aφ1(x) + bφ2(x)] = aO[φ1] + bO[φ2]. Which of the 8 operators above is linear?\nProblem 5:\nWavelengths and quantum effects\n(Solved) Derive the following expression relating the de Broglie wavelength of a particle of mass m with its (non-\nrelativistic) energy and velocity, v, from the fundamental relation, p = ħk = mv:\nħc\nλ = 2π mc2\nr\nmc2\n2E\nSolution:\nThe particle momentum p is related it to the wavelength, via its relation to the wavenumber k:\n\np = ħk = ħ\n,\nλ\nand it is related to the kinetic energy E by:\np =\n√\n2mE\nEquating these two expressions, we can write\n2πħ\nħc\nλ = √\n= 2π\n2mE\nmc2\nr\nmc2\n2E\nNote that this expression makes it easier to evaluate λ through energy equivalents and universal constant combinations.\na) A nuclear reactor produces fast neutrons (with energy ∼1MeV) which are then slowed down to thermal neutrons\n(with energy of order E ∼0.025eV, comparable to their thermal energy at room temperature). In research reactors,\nboth types of neutrons could be selected to exit through a port and used in scattering experiments to study crystals.\nCrystal lattice spacing is usually a few angstrom and to get information about the crystal in a scattering experiment\nthe radiation wavelength should be on the same order of the lattice spacing. Would you select fast or thermal neutrons\nfor a scattering experiment?\n[Calculate the de Broglie wavelength in both cases to give a more quantitative answer.]\nb) One of the largest object for which diffraction effects have been observed are buckyballs [see Nature 401, 680-682\n(1999)], a molecule containing 60 Carbon atoms. In the experiment, the buckyball velocity was v ≈220m/s. What\nwas the wavelength of the buckyball?\n[Compare it to the diffraction grating used in the experiment consisting of 50-nm-wide slits with a 100-nm period. ]\n2π\n\nProblem 6:\nEigenvalue equations\na) What is an eigenvalue equation? Write two examples of eigenvalue equations (no need to solve them).\nb) A rotation in a plane (in a 2D geometric space) is given by an operator represented by the matrix:\nR(θ) =\n\ncos θ -sin θ\nsin θ\ncos θ\n\nFind the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operator, in the case θ = π/3.\nc) Consider a vector in a plane. The vector forms a 60*angle with the x-axis (in the xy plane).\ni) Write an expression for the vector with respect to the basis given by the x and y axis.\nii) Now write the same vector with respect to axes rotated by 45*with respect to the x and y axes.\nd) Consider a classical oscillator in 1D. The force acting on the oscillator when it's away from its equilibrium position\nby x is F = -kx. Write the equation of motion for the oscillator and explain why this can be considered as an\neigenvalue equation. Solve for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the oscillator.\nProblem 7:\nDirac Delta Function\nProve the following properties of the Dirac Delta Function:\n(a - Solved) δ(x) = δ(-x)\nSolution:\nTo prove a property of the delta function, you need to evaluate the integrals of the delta functions with an arbitrary\nfunction f(x),\nZ inf\n-inf\nδ(-x)f(x)dx =\ninf\n-\nZ\nδ(x′)f(\n-\ninf\n-x′)dx′\n(1)\n=\nZ inf\nδ(x′)f( x\ninf\n-\n′)dx′\n-\n= f(0)\nIn the last step we used the change of variables x′ = -x in (1). Since\nR\nδ(x)f(x)dx = f(0) (by def nition of the delta\nfunction), we have shown that δ(-x) = δ(x).\nb) δ(ax) = 1δ(x) (where a is a constant).\na\nc) f(x)δ(x -x0) = f(x0)δ(x -x0)\nProblem 8:\nFourier Transform\na) Another property of the Dirac Delta function is that δ(x) =\ninf\nR\n-infeikx dk. Using this result, what is the Fourier\nπ\ntransform of cos(kx)?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Due on Wednesday April 4, 2012\nProblem 1:\nCoupled representation (Solved Problem)\nA nucleus consists of two spin 1/2 nucleons, s1 = 1\n2, and, s2 = 1\n2. Both nucleons are in the orbital angular momentum\nl = 0.\na) How many spin states are there for each nucleon?\nSolution:\nEach nucleon can be in two states\n2, + 1\n\n= |↑⟩and\n\n2, -1\n\n= |↓⟩, since -s ≤ms ≤s.\nb) How many spin states does the system have (based on the uncoupled representation)?\nSolution:\nIn the uncoupled representation good quantum numbers correspondto the eigenvalues of the operators Sˆ2\n1, Sˆ2\n2, Sˆ1,z, Sˆ2,z.\nSince s1,2 = 1\n2 while ms for each particle can take two values, we can list four possible states: |↑↑⟩, |↑↓⟩, |↓↑⟩, |↓↓⟩.\nc) Which quantum numbers would you use to label the coupled representation states?\nSolution:\nIn the coupled representation a complete set of commuting observables is given by S2 S , S2 and S2\nz\n2, thus good\nquantum numbers are s, ms, s1, s2 (in this case, we can omit s1 and s2 since they're always 1\n2 and write a state as\n|s, ms⟩.)\nProblem 2:\nCommutation of angular momentum\na) (Solved question) Prove the commutation relation,\nh\nLb2\n1, Lb2i\n= 0\nand\nh\nL\n1,z, L\n\nˆ\nˆ\ni\n= 0\nˆ\nwhere L = L1 + L2.\nb\nb\nSolution:\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nFrom the definition of L, we have that the norm of the total angular momentum is Lˆ2\nˆ\n= L2\nˆ\n1 + L2\n2 + 2L1 · L2. Also,\noperators acting on different particles always commute, e.g., ˆ\n[L2, Lˆ2\nLˆ\n2] = 0, [\n1,x, Lˆ2,y] = 0, since they are functions\nof different variables.\nThen the first commutator is very easily evaluated:\nh\nL2\n1, L2i\n=\nh\nˆ\nL2\n1, L2\nˆ\n1 + 2L1 · L2\ni\n= 0\nFor the second commutator, we use the fa\nb\nct th\nb\nat [Lˆ2, Lˆ\nb\nz] =\nb\n0 to simplify the result:\nh\nLb\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n1,z, Lb\ni\nh\nL\n, ˆ\nˆ\n=\n1,z L1 + L2 + 2L1 · L2\ni\n=\nh\nL1,z, Lˆ1 + 2L1 · L2\ni\n=\nh\nLb\nˆ\nˆ\n1,z, 2L1 · L2\ni\n= 2\nh\nLb1\nLˆ\n,z,\n1,\nb\nˆ\nxL2x + Lˆ1 Lˆ\n,y\nˆ\ny + L1\nˆ\n,zL2z\n=\nb\ni\nh\nLb1,z, Lˆ1\nˆ\n,xL2x\ni\n+ 2\nh\nLb1,z, Lˆ1\nˆ\n,yL2y\ni\n\nWe finally also use the formula [A, BC] = B[A, C] + [A, B]C to find the final result:\nh\nLb\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nħˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n,z, Lb\ni\n= 2\nh\nLb1,z, L1,x\ni\nL2x + 2\nh\nLb1,z, L1,y\ni\nL2y = 2i (L1yL2x -L1xL2y)\nb) Prove the commutation relation,\nLx, L2 = 0\nand discuss why the same relation holds for the othe\nh\nr,\nb\n(y,\nb\nz)\ni\n, components of the angular momentum.\nProblem 3:\nAngular momentum operator\nSuppose a system is in the angular momentum state |7, 4⟩, with l = 7 and mx = 4.\na) What are the possible measurement results for the x component of angular momentum?\nb) What are the possible measurement values for the y component of the angular momentum?\nc) Given the uncertainty relationship for angular momentum, ∆La∆Lb ≤ħ\n2 ⟨Lc⟩(with a, b, c permutations of x, y, z),\nwhat are ⟨Ly⟩and ⟨Lz⟩for the state |7, 4⟩? Is this consistent with the result you found above?\nd) What is ∆Ly =\nq\nL2y\n\n-⟨Ly⟩2 for the state |7, 4⟩if we assume ∆Ly = ∆Lz?\nProblem 4:\nLadder operators\nConsider a system in the state |l, mz⟩, that is, in an eigenstate of the Lz angular momentum with eigenvalue ħmz\nand with total angular momentum quantum number is l [i.e. the state is also an eigenstate of L2 with eigenvalue\nħ2l(l + 1)].\na) Consider the Ladder operators L+ = Lx + iLy and L\n= Lx -iLy. What is L+ |l, mz⟩? (see lecture notes and\n-\nGriffiths).\nWhat is then the expectation value of L+ and L\nfor the state considered (\n-\n|l, mz⟩)?\nb) Using the result you found above, prove that the result you found in Problem 3:c (the value of ⟨Lx⟩) is in general\ntrue for any eigenstate of Lz, L2.\nProblem 5:\nSum of angular momenta\nThe electron in an hydrogen atom is in the state ψ(r, θ, φ) = R\n21(r)\n\n√\n3Y 0\n1 (θ, φ)|↓⟩+\nq\n3Y -1\n(θ, φ)|↑⟩\n\n, where\n|↑⟩=\nms = 1\n\nand |↓⟩=\nms = -1\n\nare eigenstates of the intrinsic spin with eigenvalues + ħ\n2 and -ħ\n2 respectively,\nY m\nl (θ, φ) = |l, m⟩are eigenfunctions of L2 and Lz, with quantum numbers l and m and R21(r) is the radial part of\nthe wavefunction .\na) (Solved question) Using the sum rules, find the possible values of the quantum number j (which sets the eigenvalue\nof Jˆ2 to ħ2\nˆ\nj(\n\nˆ\nˆ\nj + 1)), where J = L + S is the total angular momentum.\nSolution:\nThe sum rules state that in the addition of two angular momentum operators, we have that |l1 -l2| ≤l ≤l1 + l2. In\nthis case we have:\nl -s ≤j ≤l + s\n→\n1 -\nj\n2 ≤\n≤1 + 2\n→\nj\n2 ≤\n≤2\nSince the angular momentum quantum number can only increase by integers between the minimum and the maximum\nvalue, we have that there are only two possible values for j, j = 1\n2 and j = 2.\nb) The wavefunction\nψ(r, θ, φ) = R21(r)\n\n√Y 0\n1 (θ, φ)\n|↓⟩+\nr\n2Y\n-\n(θ, φ)|↑⟩\n!\n\ncan also be written as:\nψ(r, θ, φ) = R21(r)\n√\nj =\n, mj = -, s =\n, l = 1\n\n-\n\nj =\n, mj =\n,\n=\n-\ns\n, l = 1\n\nWhich one of these two expression is the coupled representation? Is the sec\n\nond expression consistent with what found\nin the previous question? How would you find the second expression for ψ\n\nfrom the first one?\nc) What are the possible outcomes and probabilities of a measurement of L2, Lz, Sz, J2 and Jz ?\nd) (Solved question) Two p electrons (l1 = l2 = 1) are in a state with angular momentum |l, m, l1, l2⟩= |2, -1, 1, 1⟩.\nWhat are the possible values of m1z and m2z?\nSolution:\nFrom the state |2, -1, 1, 1⟩we know that l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. Thus m1z = {-1, 0, 1} and m2z = {-1, 0, 1}. The\nvalues of m1z and m2z must add up to give m = -1. We can obtain this result in two ways: either m1z = -1 and\nm2z = 0 or vice-versa, m1z = 0 and m2z = -1. Thus notice that the eigenvalues of L1z and L2z are not known from\nthe coupled representation state: indeed these two operators do not commute with the total angular momentum L2 so\nin general we cannot know the eigenvalue of L2 and of L1z and L2z with certainty at the same time.\ne) Two p electrons (l1 = l2 = 1) are in a state with angular momentum |l, m, l1, l2⟩= |2, -2, 1, 1⟩. What are the\npossible outcomes of a measurement of L1\nz? What are the probabilities of each of these outcomes? What is the joint\nprobability of measuring for both electrons L1\nz = L2\nz = -ħ?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Due on Friday Apr. 20, 2012\nProblem 1:\nSpin and Parity assignment\na) (solved) Give the spin and parity, as expected from the shell model, of the ground states of 173Yb.\nSolution:\nIn order to determine the spin and parity of these nuclides, we consider the valence nucleon model: only the last\nunpaired nucleon determine the spin and the parity of the nucleus. Thus we first need to determine which one is the\nunpaired nucleon. For 173Yb it is a neutron, since Yb has an odd number (103) of neutrons. All the neutrons are\nstacked in the shell model energy levels, and they occupy completely all the levels, up to the 2f5/2 shell, as we can\nread from Fig. 39 (Krane 5.6) of the lecture notes. The unpaired neutron is then in one of the 2f5/2 eigenstate (there\nwill be 6 of these states, as given by that level degeneracy). Thus we expect the spin of the 173Yb nucleus to be 5\n2. The\nparity is determined by the angular momentum, in this case f = 3 (an odd number) so it will be odd parity,\n-\nb) Give the spin and parity, as expected from the shell model, of the ground states of\n1) 7Li,\n2) 15N,\n3) 29Si,\n4) 43Ca,\n5) 87Ru,\n6) 133Cs.\nProblem 2:\nExcited states\na) (solved) The first two excited states of Be-9 have energy E=214keV and E=1.1MeV. What are the expected spin-\nparity assignments of these excited states?\nSolution:\nThe properties of Be-9 will be mainly due to its last unpaired neutron. In the ground state, this is found in the 1p 3\nstate, thus giving\n-\nspin/parity. Possible excited states (see figure) arise if the neutron in that level get excited to\nthe next level (1p 1\n2) or if one neutron from the 1s levels gets promoted to the 1p 3\n2 level. Note that we expect this last\nconfiguration to be lower in energy than the previous one, because of the pairing force. Thus we assign spin parity\n+\nto the 214keV excited level and\n-\n1s1/2\n1p3/2\n1p1/2\nto the 1.1MeV level.\nb) 81Br ground state has spin\n-\nI = 3\nπ\n2 and odd parity (I\n= 2 ). The three first excited states have a small energy: 1)\n-\nIπ = 5\n2 , E1 = 275.985keV;\n2)\n+\nIπ = 9 ,\n-\nE = 536.20keV;\n3) Iπ\n= 2 , E3 = 538.20keV\nExplain these 4 states based on the shell model.\n[Note that the valence nucleon model (and the shell model) are good models to predict the ground state properties\nof nuclei, but often fail to predict the excited states. Thus you can often expect some counter-intuitive results when\nlooking at the excited state ordering of the energy levels.]\n\nProblem 3:\nSpin-orbit coupling\nˆ\nˆ\nLet the energy for a nucleon in the absence of spin-orbit coupling be E0 and the spin-orbit potential be Vso/ħ2L · S.\na) What is the energy for the nucleon in each of the possible spin-orbit configuration and what is the difference in\nenergy between the two states?\nb) (solved) Show that the center of gravity of the two configurations (or the average energy weighted by the degener-\nacy) is given by E0.\nSolution:\nThe weighted average of the energy is\nD(l + 1/2) × El+1/2 + D(l -1/2) × El-1/2\nE =\ntotal # of states\nwhere D is the degeneracy of each state, which is equal to D(j) = 2j+1 and El± 1\n2 are the energies of the two possible\nspin-orbit states. Thus we have\n(2l + 2)(E\nl\n-\n0 + Vso ) + (2l)(E0\nVso(l + 1)/2)\nE =\n4l + 2\n(4l + 2)E0 + V\n-\nso[(l + 1)l\nl(l + 1)]\n=\n= E0\n4l + 2\nc) Consider Bismuth-209 (209\n83 Bi). Based only on filling the levels of the shell model, what is the spin/parity assignment\nof this nuclide?\nd) Bismuth-209 is found just outside the shell which gives rise to the magic number 82, although the simple oscillator\nmodel would not predict a shell splitting for this nucleon number. What part of the nuclear interaction is responsible\nfor this splitting? Calculate the energy splitting between the Bismuth-209 level and the 82-magic number level.\nProblem 4:\nShell model: Anomalous states\nThe spin parity for\n-\n+\n195Pt is Iπ = 1\ninstead of the expected 13\n. Similarly, 205Tl ground state is\n+\nIπ = 1\ninstead\nof the expected\n-\n. The ground state of 87Sr is instead the expected state\n+\n2 , but this isotope has a very long-lived\nexcited state with spin-parity\n-\n(lifetime ∼3 hours).\na) What aspect of the nuclear force makes the first two configurations energetically favorable? Based on the different\nconfiguration of Sr-87, what does this force depend on?\nb) Give the shell-model configurations for these 3 nuclei that are consistent with their spin-parity assignments.\nProblem 5:\nOscillator model and binding energy\nConsider the oscillator model for Calcium, 40Ca giving the energies EN = ħωN -V ′\n0, with V0 = 33MeV (for\nneutrons).\n(Notice that here we included the zero energy level of the oscillator into the potential depth).\na) Calculate the nucleon energy EN for each oscillator level that allows a bound state. What oscillator level corre-\nsponds to the first unbound state?\nb) What is the average binding energy per nucleon? (The binding energy for one nucleon in the N th level of the\nharmonic oscillator is given by -EN)\nc) Compare the binding energy for 40Ca found from the oscillator model with the binding energy found as the\ndifference in mass energy between the nucleus and its constituents.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Because of the energy released in the fission, Bromine-81 is\nusually left in an excited state, from which it can decay by emitting gamma radiation. The observed gamma radiations\nare as follow:\n\n- M2 with energy Eγ = 260keV, from the second excited level to the first excited level.\n- M1, E2 with energy Eγ = 276keV, from the first excited level to the ground state.\nThe ground state and first two excited states of 81\n33Br can be determined by considering an unpaired proton in the 5th\nnuclear shell, between the magic number 28 and 50 (see Krane, Fig. 5.6, also reproduced in the Lecture notes.)\nTaking into account the selection rules of gamma decay, determine the spin parity assignment for the ground state and\nthe first two excited states of Bromine-81.\n[Hints: i) the three levels are among the 4 possible levels inside the 5th nuclear shell, since jumping to the next shell\nwill imply a much larger energy change. ii) Remember that lower electric multipoles would be favorable, unless they\nare forbidden because we must have |Ii -If| ≤Lγ ≤If + Ii. iii) The pairing force plays a role in determining which\nconfiguration has a lower energy. ]\nProblem 4:\nGamma decay and shell structure (solved)\na) 211\nof the shell model, what is the spin/parity assignment of this nuclide?\nSolution:\nWe have 125 neutrons, with the last unpaired neutron in the i 13 level. Thus the spin should be 13 and the parity\nΠ = (-1)l with l = 6, then even parity.\nb) Another characteristics of the nuclear force makes the naive spin/parity assignment you gave in question a) im-\nprobable. A rearrangement of the nucleons in the shell gives a lower energy: what is the resulting in which spin/parity\nassignment?\nPo decays by alpha decay. The product of the alpha decay is Lead-207 (207Pb). Based only on filling the levels\nSolution:\nThe pairing force tends to pair up nucleons of the same type. This pairing lowers the energy and the energy gain is\nmuch more pronounced the larger the angular momentum. Thus, we expect that a neutron will jump to the i 13 level\nto leave only pairs in that level. The remaining unpaired neutron is likely to be in the 3p 1 level (which has very low j\nand is still close in energy to i 13.) giving a spin parity: 1 -.\nc) Following the alpha decay from 211Po, 207Pb is left in an excited state with spin/parity 3 -and energy 897keV\nabove the ground state. The nucleus decays from this state by gamma emission to the ground state. What are the\npermitted multipoles and which multipoles are most likely to be observed? Give the approximate ratio of the two most\nprobable decay mode rates.\nSolution:\nConsidering the transition from 3 -to 1 -, we have no change in parity and possible angular momentum given by\n3 ± 1 = {2, 1}. Thus we have an E2 or M1 transition. It is known that the ratio between the rates of these two\ntransitions is usually about 10-3. This is confirmed by using the rates given in the lecture notes (and Krane):\nλ(E2)\n7.3\n3E5\n=\n× 107A4/\n≈10-4(207)4/30.92\n1.6\n10-3\nλ(M1)\n5.6\n1 13E\n≈\n×\n× 0\nConsidering the transition from\n-to\n+\n13 , we have change in parity and possible angular momentum given by\n13 -3 ≤l ≤13 + 3 = {5, 6, 7, 8}. Thus we have E5, M6, E7,M8 transitions, with E5 the most probable. It is known\nthat the ratio between the rates of the two strongest transitions (E5 and M6) is usually about 10-7.\nd) Detection of gamma rays with lower energies (328keV and 569keV) indicates that there is an intermediate level\nbetween the 3 -excited state and the ground state. The observed multipoles are M1 (associated with the energy\n328keV) and E2. With the help of the selection rules and of the shell structure, find the spin/parity of this intermediate\nlevel and its energy above the ground state.\nSolution:\nBecause the two transitions have different energies, they must arise from the decay between different energy levels.\nThus one will be associated with the decay from the excited to the intermediate level and the second from the interme-\ndiate level (first excited level) to the ground state (see also figure 1). Also, you must ensure that both these transitions\nrespect the selection rules in a consistent way when finding the spin-parity of the intermediate level.

Related gamma\ndecay levels.\nobserved, E2 and M1, imply no change in parity, thus the parity of the intermediate level must be odd. Thus we are\nlooking for a state with l odd, and we can then focus on the N = 5 shell levels, which have l odd, without needing to\nlook in the higher shell. If the M1 transition were from the intermediate level to the ground state 1 -, the level spin\nparity could only be 3 -, but this is not possible (since we already know that that is the second excited state). Thus,\nthe order of the transitions is M1 from 3 -to the intermediate level and E2 from that level to the ground state. Finally\nto have a ∆l = 1 from 3 -and ∆l = 2 to 1 -the only possible intermediate level is 2f 5. From the gamma energy,\nthis level is predicted to be 569keV above the ground state. Notice that considering the ground state to be\n+\nwould\nhave led to a contradictory result here.\ne) Based on your previous answers and what you found in Problem 3, draw a scheme of the unclosed shell for 207Pb\nshowing the level occupancy for the ground state and the two first excited states (involved in the gamma decay) that\nexplain the various spins and parities you found.\nSolution:\nSee Figure 1\nProblem 5:\nGaussian wavepacket evolution (Solved Problem)\nThis problem will be solved in recitation.\nConsider a free particle in 1D. At time t=0 the particle is well localized, thus it is described by a Gaussian wavepacket:\nψ(x, t = 0) =\ne-x2/(4a2)\n(2πa2)1/4\n\na) What are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian for this free particle?\nSolution:\nEigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the system only depend on the Hamiltonian, and not on the particular state of the\nsystem.\nThe free particle Hamiltonian is H = pˆ2/2m. The eigenfunctions of this Hamiltonian are ψk(x) = Aeikx or ψk(x) =\nA′e-ikx with eigenvalues Ek =\nħk2/2m.\nb) Express the wavefunction ψ(x, t = 0) in terms of the energy (Hamiltonian) eigenfunctions.\nUse the properties of the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function to find an explicit expression.\nSolution:\nWe can always express the wavefunction as a linear combination of energy eigenfunctions, since they form a basis.\nThe variable k is continuous, so we can express ψ(x, 0) as an integral over the ψk\nψ(x, 0) = √\nZ inf\nc(k)eikxdk\n(1)\n2π\n-inf\nwhere\nc(k) = √\n2π\nZ inf\nψ(0)e-ikxdx\n-inf\nsince the coefficient are calculated from the inner product of the basis eigenfunction with the wavefunction, c(k) =\n⟨eikx|ψ(x, 0)⟩.

      "content": "22.02 - Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nProblem set # 9\nIssued on Thursday May. 3, 2012. Due on Wednesday May 9, 2012\nProblem 1:\nSolar neutrinos\nFusion reactions occur in the sun. One of the most common chain starts from the fusion of protons to achieve alpha\nparticles. The following processes (that you need to complete with the missing components) occur:\na) 1H+1H →· · · + · · · + . . .\nb) 1H+ · · · →3He+γ\n(note this is not a beta process, still conservation rules apply)\nc) 1H+3He →4He+ · · · + . . .\nProblem 2:\nHelium-8\nHelium-8 is one of the most neutron-rich isotope that can be produced. Recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 252501 (2007)]\nit has been studied to determine its nuclear radius (shedding light on various nuclear models). In order to study the\nradius, He-8 was produced and then kept at rest by an atom trap (given by lasers). Helium-8 decays by a beta process:\nWhat is the reaction? What is the kinetic energy of the reaction products?\nProblem 3:\nBeta Decays\nIn the decay of Cu-64 both neutrinos and antineutrinos are observed.\na) What are the two possible beta-decay processes and products?\nb) Calculate the Q values for both decay modes.\nProblem 4:\nNeutrino spectrum\nThe spectrum of the emitted beta particles can be computed by considering the density of states of the outgoing\nparticles. Omitting constant parameters, the energy dependence is given by:\nN(Te) ∝F(Z, Q) [Q -T\ne]2 p\nT\ne + 2Temec (Te + mec ) ≈[Q -Te]\np\nTe + 2Temec (Te + mec )\nwhere the last relationship is valid for small Z.\na) Plot the spectrum of the beta particles, assuming Q = 0.5MeV .\n(You can use your favorite mathematical software. The simplest solution is to use www.wolframalpha.com and plot\nthe spectrum online. There's then a link at the bottom of the page to download your result as pdf. )\nb) Calculate and plot the spectrum of the neutrino, assuming the same Q = 0.5MeV .\n\nProblem 5:\nBeta Decay: Selection Rule\nFor many beta decay processes the neutrino and electron/positron produced have zero angular momentum, l = 0. Both\nthe neutrino and the electron (as well as their anti-particles) have intrinsic spin angular momentum S = 1\n2.\na) If the parent nuclide has initial spin Ii, what are the possible values of the daughter nuclide spin, If?\nb) If the parity of the parent nuclide is Π, what is the parity of the daughter nuclide? (note that the parity of particles\nsuch as the neutrino and beta is always given by Π = (-1)l).\nProblem 6:\nNeutron Elastic Scattering\nWe derived in class the energy loss for the neutron in an elastic scattering:\nA2 + 1 + 2A cosθ\n∆E/E0 = (E1 -E0)/E0 =\n(A + 1)2\n-\nHere θ is the angle between the initial neutron direction and its f nal direction in the center of mass frame.\na) What is the angle φ (see Fig. 49 of lecture notes) between the initial neutron direction and its f nal direction in the\nlab frame?\nYou should only derive the following relationship:\n1 + A cos θ\ncos φ = √\nA2 + 1 + 2A cosθ\nb) When can backscattering (in the lab frame) occurr? For which isotope it never occurrs?\nc) In the center of mass frame the scattering is isotropic, meaning that the probability of cos θ is constant: P(cos θ) =\n2. Then the probability of a certain angle φ is obtained from P(cos φ)d(cos φ) = P(cos θ)d(cos θ). What is the\naverage ⟨cos φ⟩?\n[You can use again e.g. wolframalpha to calculate the integral, but in that case you'll need to try out some values for\nA to f nd a solution (e.g. try A=1,2,3 and deduce the result for any A).]\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "22.02 Intro to Applied Nuclear Physics\nMid-Term Exam\nSolution\nProblem 1:\nShort Questions\n24 points\nThese short questions require only short answers (but even for yes/no questions give a brief explanation)\na) In the SEMF, the volume term gives the most important contribution to the binding energy B, setting B ∝A (with\nA the mass number). What does this tell us about the nuclear force keeping nucleons together?\n[Hint: your answer - and the word! - would be much different if the volume term were B ∝A(A -1)]\nSolution:\nThis behavior of the binding energy tells us that the nuclear force has a short range so that each nucleon only interacts\nwith a fixed, small number of neighbors and not with all the other A -1 nucleons.\nb) True or False?:\ni) The Q-value of a fusion reaction is always Q > 0 (and very large!).\nii) Still it is very difficult to obtain fusion because of the Coulomb repulsion VC between the fusing nuclei.\nii) Thus we always need to give the fusing nuclei enough energy that their energy is E > VC, by going to very high\ntemperatures.\nSolution:\nThe first statement is true only for two light nuclei fusing together (in general two nuclides at the left of the maximum\nin the B/A curve). The second statement is true, while the last one is false: we need to give enough energy for the two\nfusing nuclide to tunnel through the coulomb barrier.\nc)\nWhat is an observable in quantum mechanics? What mathematical object represents it? (Give also an example).\nSolution:\nAn observable is a physical property that we can measure; it is represented by an hermitian operator. Examples are\nmomentum, position, magnetic moment, energy...\nd) What is a complete set of commuting observables and why do we need it?\nAre {Lxy, Lz} a complete set of commuting observables? (Here Lxy = L2\nx + L2\ny)\nSolution:\nA complete set of commuting observables is a set of observables (operators) that commute and that can completely lift\nany degeneracy in their common eigenfunctions, so that the state eigenfunction is completely determined.\nThe fact that Lx, Ly do not commute with Lz does not imply that Lxy does not commute with Lz; in fact the opposite\ncan be very easily proven by just knowing the commutation of Lz with L2. Note that Lxy = L2 -Lz. Since both\nL2 and Lz commute with Lz, Lxy commute with Lz: thus {Lxy, Lz} can be part of a complete set of commuting\nobservables. Indeed they do form a complete set commuting observables: as for L2, eigenfunctions of Lxy are doubly\ndegenerate, since for each eigenvalue of L\nxy, given by ħ[l(l + 1) -mz] there are two possible eigenfunctions |l, mz⟩\nand |l, -mz⟩. Measuring both Lxy and Lz determines completely the eigenfunction.\ne) If we measure the potential energy ˆV = V (xˆ) of a quantum particle and immediately after we measure its position\nxˆ, is the result of the second measurement random?\nSolution:\nNo: if the potential energy measurement gave an outcome V (x⋆), then the position is x⋆with probability 1. This is\nbecause the potential energy measurement projects the wavefunction of the system into a potential energy eigenfunc-\ntion (wavefunction collapse) and this potential energy eigenfunction is also an eigenfunction of the position, since the\ntwo operators commute. (The two operators commute because V (xˆ) is a function of xˆ).\n\nf) Which one of the following statements (if any) is correct, based on the properties of the angular momentum and its\neigenfunctions?\n1) A particle is in the angular momentum eigenstate:\nψl,mz(θ, φ) = |l=-1, mz=0⟩.\n2) A particle is in the angular momentum eigenstate:\nψl,mz(θ, φ) = |l=0, mz=-1⟩.\n3) A particle is in the angular momentum eigenstate:\nψl,mz(θ, φ) = |l=1, mz=0⟩.\n4) A particle is in the angular momentum eigenstate:\nψl,my(θ, φ) = |l=1, my=-1⟩.\nSolution:\nWrong (l is always a non-negative integer). Wrong (-l < mz < l in integer steps). Correct, Correct: both these last\ntwo states respect all the requirements for l and |m| ≤l, both integers.\ng) Consider a finite quantum well of depth Vw and width 2a (between -a and +a, while V = 0 outside the well) and\na particle in an even energy eigenfunction with energy E. Is the particle bound?\nSolution:\nSince the solution is an even solution, we can get a bound state for any value of a and Vw. However, we have a bound\nstate only if E < 0. If E > 0 the particle is just scattering above the well. Note also that if E < Vw we don't have a\nsolution at all.\nh) A system is subject to a potential V (x) and is found in two possible states described by two different wavefunctions.\nThe first wavefunction is an eigenfunction of the momentum while the second wavefunction is an eigenfunction of the\nHamiltonian. Which wavefunction describes a stationary state? Why?\nSolution:\nThe energy eigenfunction because it is a solution of the time-independent Schr odinger equation. Do not confuse the\nmomentum eigenfunction with the momentum itself: the momentum is an operator. In the description of QM we have\nuntil now, operators do not evolve in time (although their expectation value and measurement outcomes do, since they\nalso depend on the system state which does depend on time). Thus, although the momentum operator is not evolving\nin time, its eigenfunctions do evolve and are not stationary states.\nProblem 2:\nTemperature\n13 points\na)\nIn classical thermodynamics, the temperature of an ideal gas (in 1D) is given by T =\nm v2\nk\n(where kB is the\nBoltzmann constant, m the mass and v the velocity). Define the corresponding quantum mec\nBhanical observable in\nterms of observables seen in class.\nSolution:\nT =\n1 (mv)2 =\n1 p2\nmkb\nmkb\n. Transforming p into the QM operator, we have\nˆ\nħ2\nd 2\nT = -mkb d x2\nb)\nConsider a \"gas of particles\" inside an infinite well (V (x) = 0 for 0 < x < L and infinite otherwise). Each\nparticle is in the state\nψ(x) =\nr\nπ\nsin\n3πx\n10 x\n11πx\n+\nsin\nL\nL\nr\n+\nL\n\nr\nsin\nL\n\n2L\n\nL\n\nWhat is the expectation value (average) of the temperature?\n[Note: you should be able to solve this problem without doing any integral!]\nSolution:\nWe recognize the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian φ (x) =\nq\n2 sin\nnπx\nn\nL\nL\n: note the factor\nL which makes sure\nthe eigenfunction is correctly normalized. If you did not remember this, you should\n\nat least considered\nq\nthat the sum of\nproabilities for the 3 states should have given you 1.\nThus the state can be written:\nψ(x) =\nφ3 +\n√φ10 +\nφ11\n\nThese are also eigenfunctions of the temperature (inside the well) since the temperature and the Hamiltonian (equal to\nthe kinetic energy in the well) commute. The corresponding temperature eigenvalues are\nħ2k2\nħ2π2\nTn =\nEn =\n=\nn2.\nkb\nmkb\nL2mkb\nThe average temperature is then:\n⟨T⟩=\nX\nT P\n=\nX\nT |c |2\nħπ\nn\n=\nπ\nn\n+\n\nħ\nħπ\nn\nn\n+\n=\n165 =\n82.5\nL2mk\nb\n2L mkb\nL mkb\nn\nn\nSome of you have started from ˆ\n2 and calculated\nD\nˆ\nE\n⟨⟩2\nT =\npˆ\nT\n=\npˆ\np2\n=\nmkb\nmkb\n: this is wrong since in general\n⟨p⟩2 (also for any other observable and any random variable).\n\nProblem 3:\nScattering\n12 points\nA source of neutrons produces a flux of neutrons of intensity Φinc and energy E. To protect the worker, in front of\nthe source a wall of thickness L has been built, which we can model with a potential barrier V > E. To monitor her\nhealth, the worker wears a detector that measure the neutron flux.\na)\nSketch a simple drawing showing how you model this problem (assume we leave in a 1D world!). Show in the\nsketch the characteristics of the wavefunction describing the neutron.\nSolution:\nNote: this problem does not describe how neutron shielding does work in practice. We will see that neutrons undergo\nmany scattering events in the material, being slow down in the wall.\nFor the problem at hand, the situation is describe by a traveling wave before and after the wall (with same wavelength\nλ but different amplitude) and a decaying exponential in the wall.\n\nFigure 1: Sketch of neutron shielding\nb)\nWhat is the flux of neutrons measured by the detector? Assume a simple model for the tunneling, in the limit\nwhere the tunneling probability is small: this means that you do not need to solve completely the problem to find the\n-approximate- answer.\nSolution:\nThe detector\nq\nmeasures the transmitted flux. In the limit of small tunneling, we can write Φt ≈4e-2κLΦinc, with\n2m(V\nκ =\n-H).\nħ\nProblem 4:\nSpontaneous Fission\n30 points\nUseful quantities: ħ\nc = 197MeV fm; e\n=\nħc\n137; c = 3 × 108m/s; R0 = 1.25fm.\nA note about this problem: Because of the small and large quantities involved, small rounding errors give very\ndifferent results. This is ok in the Midterm, but if you want to calculate something like this in real life, make sure you\npay attention to numerical errors.\nAlso, although the final answer does give you an idea about the fact that Cm can indeed undergo spontaneous fission,\nestimating the fission rate in this way is a bad approximation, since we expect Cm to fission not in just these two\nfragments but to lead to a distribution of possible pairs of fragment, all accompanied by the release of some neutrons.\nThis would be a 3 (or larger) body problem, which complicates estimates.\n\na) Consider the isotope Curium-250 (250\n96 Cm), with mass 232.938 GeV. Given its A and Z numbers, do you expect this\nisotope to be stable?\nSolution:\nThe ratio of the mass and proton number is Z/A ≈0.384. We know that for heavy stable nuclei this ratio is instead\n≈0.41 (Z ≈A/2 only for light nuclides). Thus we expect this isotope to be unstable and to decay by a process that\nwill make it shed some neutrons or acquire smaller A.\nCurium-250 is the lightest nuclide to undergo spontaneous fission as the main decay mode. We want to analyze this\ndecay mode following the same theory we saw for alpha decay and in particular estimate the half-life of 250Cm. The\nfollowing questions will guide you through the estimation.\nb) Assume that the spontaneous fission leads to the decay:\n96 Cm →130Te\n78 +44 Ru76\nWhat is the Q-value for the reaction? How does this compare to the usual Q-value for typical alpha decay?\n[The mass of 250\n96 Cm is 232.938GeV, the mass of 52 Te78 is 121.002 GeV and the mass of 44 Ru76 is 111.724GeV]\nSolution:\nThe Q-value can be calculated from the mass differences:\nQ = mCm -mNd -mKr = 0.212GeV = 212MeV\nTypical alpha decay release a few MeV of energy, so the Q value here is much larger.\nc) What is the Coulomb potential VC(R) = Q1Q2\nR\nat the distance R = RT e + RRu, where RX is the nuclear radius?\nWhat is the distance Rc at which the Coulomb potential is equal to the Q-value?\nSolution:\nThe nuclear radius is RA = 1.25A1/3fm, thus we have:\nRR\nm\nu = 1.25f\n× 1201/ = 6.17fm\nRT e = 1.25fm × 1301/3 = 6.33fm\nyielding R = 12.50fm.\nThe Coulomb potential is given by\ne2Z\ne2\nNdZKr\nZNdZ\nħ\nKr\nVC(R) =\n=\nc\n=\n197MeV fm\n×\n= 263.20MeV\nR\nħc\nR\n12.50fm\nNote: because the fine constant e2 =\nc\n137 was given in cgs units, the Coulomb potential could be calculated from it in\nħ\ncgs units.\nTo find the distance Rc we equate the Coulomb potential to the Q-value:\ne2Z1Z\ne Z Z\nV (R)\n263.20\n= Q\nRc\n→\nC\nRC =\n= R\n= 12.50fm\nQ\nQ\n×\n= 15.52fm\nd) We want to estimate the probability of tunneling for an effective particle in the center of mass frame of the Tellurium\nand Ruthenium nuclei (with reduced mass μ).\nTo estimate the tunneling probability we replace the Coulomb barrier with a rectangular barrier of height VH =\nVC(R) and length L = (Rc -R). What is the tunneling probability?\nSolution:\nThe reduced mass is\nm1m2\n121.002\nμ =\n× 111.724\n=\n= 58.089GeV\nm1 + m2\n111.724 + 121.002\nSince we want to estimate the tunneling probability, we take the approximate expression P\n= 4e-2κL\nT\n. We first need\nto calculate κ:\np\n2μ(VC(R)\nκ =\n-Q) = 12.38fm-1\nħ\n\nWe then have 2κL = 74.75 and PT = 4e-2κL ≈1.38 × 10-32 . Since the tunneling probability is low, the\napproximation we took in considering PT = 4e-2κL instead of the exact expression is a good one.\ne)\nBesides the tunneling probability, to calculate the spontaneous fission rate we need to calculate the frequency\nf =\nv for the reduced effective particle to be at the edge of the Coulomb potential. Here v\nR\nis the reduced particle\nspeed inside the nuclear well (depth V0 = 35MeV) when taking Q as the (classical) energy.\nSolution:\nNote: Q is the total energy of the (effective) particle. Thus the kinetic energy is TK = Q -V but V = -V0 inside the\nwell, thus we have 1μv2 = Q + V0\n. Since in the problem statement I wrote taking Q as the (classical) kinetic energy\n(now corrected above) I considered correct the solution with 1μv2 = Q\n.\nFrom 1μv2 = Q + V0\nwe can obtain the velocity,\n2(Q + V0)\nv =\ns\nc = 0.092c = 2.77\nμc2\n× 1022fm/s\nNote that we need to add V0 since it is the well depth (thus a negative energy!).\nThe frequency is f = v = 2.77\nR\n×1022\n.50\ns-1 = 2.21 × 1021 s-1.\nf) Finally, give the decay rate λ and the half-life for spontaneous fission of Curium 250.\nSolution:\nThe decay rate is obtained from the same semi-classical model we studied for alpha decay. Thus it is given by the\nproduct of the frequency at which the proton is at the potential barrier (or gets separated from the parent nuclide) times\nthe probability of tunneling through the barrier. Thus the decay rate is given by λ = fPT = 3.05 × 10-11s-1 and the\nhalf life is t 1 = ln 2/λ = 721years.\n\nProblem 5:\nMatch the potential\n21 points\nA quantum system in a 1D geometry has energy as shown by the green line and is subjected to the potential energy as\nin the figures labeled A-C, with 3 or 5 regions of different potential height.\nFor each figure 1-7, state whether the curve plotted is a good energy eigenfunction for one (or more!) of the potentials\nand energies in Fig. A-C. Provide a brief explanation of the reasoning that lead you to your conclusion.\n(Notice: here I plot the real part of the eigenfunction).\nE\nV\nA\nE\nV\nB\nE\nV\nC\nSolution:\nWe have the following pairings: A→1, B→5 and C→4.\nThe wavefunction in 1 is a bound wavefunction with an exponential decay in the classically forbidden region, in\nagreement with the potential in Fig. A. Wavefunctions 2 and 3 cannot describe an eigenfunction for the potential A,\n\n2 because it is not continuous at the boundary (while potential A has only a finite discontinuity there) and 3 because\nis not either an even or odd function, as required by the symmetry of the potential (it was indeed the sum of the first\neven solution with the first odd solution).\nWavefunction 5 represents a particle coming from the left, tunneling through a barrier, which decrease its amplitude,\noscillating and then tunneling through a second barrier: this is consistent with potential B. Wavefunction 6 looks\nsimilar, but it still oscillates in region 4, so the potential should have two barriers of different height and the particle\nhigher energy than the second barrier.\nWavefunctions 4 and 6 describe a particle with energy always higher than any potential, as in C. However, only 4\nis consistent with C, while 6 would be consistent with an inverted potential (see figure), since its wavelength in the\nbarrier region is smaller (κ larger).\nA-1\n2: Infinite well\nA-3: Superposition of two eigenfunc-\ntions\nA-3: The two eigenfunctions\nB-5\nC-4\n6: Unequal barriers\n7: Scattering over wells (not barriers)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "22.02 Intro to Applied Nuclear Physics\nFinal Exam\nMonday, May 16, 2010\nSolutions\nProblem 1:\nShort Questions\n30 points\n1. What characteristic of the nuclear force explains the volume term in the semi-empirical mass formula (in other\nwords, it explains why the binding energy is almost proportional to A: B ≈avA)?\nThe nuclear force is charge-independent and very short range. Thus each nucleon (irrespective of being a\nneutron or a proton) is interacting mostly only with a constant number of neighbors, giving B ∼A and not with\nall other nucleons, which would give B ∼A(A -1)\n2. What is the spin of the deuteron? What is the degeneracy of this state? What characteristic of the nuclear force\ndetermines the deuteron spin?\nSince the nuclear force has a spin-dependent part, it is more energetically favorable for the deuteron to be in a\nspin triplet state. This state has a trifold degeneracy\n3. In the shell model, we fill up the energy levels with nucleons, based on the degeneracy of each level, to determine\nthe occupied levels and e.g. obtain the nucleus spin/parity assignment. Why do we consider neutrons and protons\nseparately in filling the levels?\nWhen predicting the nuclear structure of nuclides, each level cannot have an arbitrary large number of protons\nand neutrons with that particular energy, since these particles are fermions, to which the Pauli exclusion prin-\nciple applies. Hence only a number equal to the degeneracy of each level can be fitted in each level. However,\nneutrons and protons are different particles, non-identical, so the Pauli's principle does not apply to a mixture\nof them.\n4. We used the Fermi golden rule to obtain the decay rate for gamma and beta decay. What are the two factors in\nthe Fermi Golden rule and what is their meaning?\nBesides numerical factors, the Fermi golden rule is given by the product of the matrix element and of the density\nof states. The first one gives the probability of a transition from the initial state to a final state. The second one\nmultiplies this probability by the number of states available, to finally give the total transition rate.\n5. What conservation laws determine the selection rules in gamma decay?\nParity conservation and total angular momentum conservation.\n6. Consider an experimental setup where a beam of alpha particles are fired at a thin gold foil. Alpha particles are\nthen detected at a certain angle from the initial beam direction. What type of cross-section is an experiment like\nthis measuring?\nSince we only measure the scattered beam at a particular angle, we are measuring the differential cross section\ndσ/dΩ. In the particular case of alpha particles scattered by nuclei, this correspond to the Rutherford scattering\ncross section\n7. If the target of the alpha particles was not a thin foil, what competing process would determine the scattering\nand slowing down of the alpha particles? Estimate the maximum energy loss per alpha particle for each collision\nin this process.\nWhile in the previous experiment there is a certain probability to scatter against the nuclei, in general it is more\nprobable that scattering happens with the much more abundant electrons in the material. Then the process is\nmeasured by the Coulomb cross-section. Because the electron is much less massive than the alpha particle,\nin a head-on collision the electron acquired twice the initial alpha velocity : ve = 2vα, thus from momentum\nconservation ∆E\n= T\nα\ne\ne\nα\ne α\ne\nα\n8. Although it is not as strong as the Nuclear force, Coulomb interaction plays a major role in determining the\nviability or the rate of many nuclear and radiation phenomena. Name some of these phenomena and explain\nbriefly what is the role of the Coulomb interaction.\n=\nm (2v )2 = 2m v\nor ∆E = 4Em /m .\n\nCoulomb interaction, as we just saw, plays a major role in scattering of charged particles from electrons and\nnuclei. Also, through the Coulomb barrier, it determines which radioactive decay is viable or not - and its rate.\nThis is the case of alpha decay vs. C-12 or other types of decay. Also, the Coulomb barrier makes it hard to\nfusion two nuclei together (fusion is then possible only at high energies) and it requires to bombard fissile nuclei\nwith neutrons for fission to start.\n9. True or False: Uranium is much more effective than water in thermalizing neutrons because the scattering cross\nsection in Uranium is of order ten times larger than the neutron-hydrogen cross section.\nSince the energy lost in a neutron-hydrogen collision is much more than in a Uranium-neutron collision, this\nstatement is false. This is reflected in the fact that we need only 18 collisions with 1H for thermalization while\n2200 with U.\n10. Above what energy can we observe pair production in the interaction of the the e.m. field with matter? Why?\nWe need an energy E ≥2 × mec2 ≈1.022MeV (or twice the rest mass of the electron).\nProblem 2:\nThe life of Polonium I: Alpha decay vs. Spontaneous fission\n10 points\nConsider the isotope of Polonium, 211\n84 Po. This is a very unstable nucleus.\na) What is the Q value of the alpha decay? What is Q for spontaneous fission (e.g. into two Molybdenum fragments)?\nQα = (m\nPo -mPb -mα)c = 8MeV, Qf = (mP o -mMo-106 -mMo-106)c2 = 141MeV\nb) Do you expect spontaneous fission to be a competing decay process for alpha decay? Why? Give some simple\nquantitative argument to support your answer.\nHint: m(Po-211)=196526 MeV/c2, m(Pb-207)=192790 MeV/c2, m(α)=3728 MeV/c2, m(Mo-105)=97726 MeV/c2,\nm(Mo-106)=98659 MeV/c2.\nEven if fission seems to be more energetically favorable, the Coulomb barrier is much lower for alpha decay, as the\nproduct ZPbZα ≪Z2\nMo, thus the probability of tunneling through the barrier is much less for the fission process.\nProblem 3:\nThe life of Polonium II: Shell Model\n12 points\nWe now focus on the alpha decay of 211\n84 Po and its products.\na) The product of the alpha decay is Lead-207 (207\n82 Pb). Based only on filling the levels of the shell model (see the\nlevel scheme attached), what is the spin/parity assignment of this nuclide?\nWe have 125 neutrons, with the last unpaired neutron in the i 13 level. Thus the spin should be 13 and the parity\nΠ = (-1)l with l = 6, then even parity.\nb) The level i 13 is part of the shell which gives rise to the magic number 126 while the level i 11 is in the next shell.\nWhat part of the nuclear interaction is responsible for this splitting? Calculate the energy splitting between the levels.\nThe spin-orbit couplings splits the two levels. The splitting can be calculated from\nV 0\nVso =\nso\nħ2 ˆl · ˆs. The dot product is\nˆ\nˆ2\nˆ\nin turn calculated from J\n= (l + ˆs) = l + ˆs + 2l · ˆs from which we have:\nˆl · ˆs =\n(ˆJ\n2 -ˆl\nħ\n-ˆs2) =\n[J(J + 1) -l(l + 1) -s(s + 1)]\nwhere s = 1 and l = 6 and j = l ± 1. We then have for the two cases J = 11 and J = 13:\n2 11 11\nħ\nħ\nˆl · ˆs =\n[\n(\n+ 1) -6 · 7 -\n] =\n[\n-42 -\n] = -2\nħ\nand\nħ\n13 13\nħ\nˆl · ˆs =\n[\n(\n+ 1) -6 · 7 -\n] =\n[\n-42 -\n] =\nħ\nNotice you did not need to calculate that. Simply, you could have calculated the difference in energy: ∆E =\nħ( 13 15 -11 13) =\n2 13\nħ\nc) Another characteristics of the nuclear force makes the naive spin/parity assignment you gave in question a) improb-\nable. A rearrangement of the nucleons in the shell gives a lower energy, resulting in which spin/parity assignment?\n\nThe pairing force tends to pair up nucleons of the same type. This pairing lowers the energy and the energy gain is\nmuch more pronounced the larger the angular momentum. Thus, we expect that a neutron will jump to the i 13 level\nto leave only pairs in that level. The remaining unpaired neutron is likely to be in the 3p 1 level (which has very low j\nand is still close in energy to i 13.)\n2f7/2\n2f5/2\n1i13/2\n1h9/2\n3p3/2\n3p1/2\n2f7/2\n2f5/2\n1i13/2\n1h9/2\n3p3/2\n3p1/2\n2f7/2\n2f5/2\n1i13/2\n1h9/2\n3p3/2\n3p1/2\n2f7/2\n2f5/2\n1i13/2\n1h9/2\n3p3/2\n3p1/2\n2f5/2\n3p3/2\n3p1/2\nM1,E2\n(897.8keV)\nM1 (328.1)keV\nE2 (569.7keV)\n569.7 keV\n897.8 keV\nGamma Decay\nFirst Excited State\nSecond Excited State\nNaive Ground State\nCorrect Ground State\nFigure 1: Unclosed shell filling for ground and excited states (open circle indicate a missing neutron). Related gamma\ndecay levels.\nProblem 4:\nThe life of Polonium III: Gamma decay\n16 points\nFollowing the alpha decay from 211Po, 207Pb is left in an excited state with spin/parity 3 -and energy 897keV. The\nnucleus decays from this state by gamma emission to the ground state.\na) What are the permitted multipoles and which multipoles are most likely to be observed? Give the approximate\nratio of the two most probable decay mode rates.\nConsidering the transition from 3 -to 1 -, we have no change in parity and possible angular momentum given by\n3 ± 1 = {2, 1}. Thus we have an E2 or M1 transition. It is known that the ratio between the rates of these two\ntransitions is usually about 10-3. This is confirmed by using the rates given in the appendix:\nλ(E2)\n7.3 × 107A4/3E5\n=\n≈10-4(207)4/30.92 ≈1.6 × 10-3\nλ(M1)\n5.6 × 1013E3\nConsidering the transition from 3 -to\n+\n13 , we have change in parity and possible angular momentum given by\n13 -3 ≤l ≤13 + 3 = {5, 6, 7, 8}. Thus we have E5, M6, E7,M8 transitions, with E5 the most probable. It is known\nthat the ratio between the rates of the two strongest transitions (E5 and M6) is usually about 10-7.\n\nb) Detection of gamma rays with lower energies (328keV and 569keV) indicates that there is an intermediate level\nbetween the 3 -excited state and the ground state. The observed multipoles are M1 (associated with the energy\n328keV) and E2. With the help of the selection rules and of the shell structure, find the spin/parity of this intermediate\nlevel and its energy above the ground state.\nBecause the two transitions have different energies, they must arise from the decay between different energy levels.\nThus one will be associated with the decay from the excited to the intermediate level and the second from the interme-\ndiate level (first excited level) to the ground state (see also figure 1). Also, you must ensure that both these transitions\nrespect the selection rules in a consistent way when finding the spin-parity of the intermediate level. The transitions\nobserved, E2 and M1, imply no change in parity, thus the parity of the intermediate level must be odd. Thus we are\nlooking for a state with l odd, and we can then focus on the N = 5 shell levels, which have l odd, without needing to\nlook in the higher shell. If the M1 transition were from the intermediate level to the ground state 1 -, the level spin\nparity could only be 3 -, but this is not possible (since we already know that that is the second excited state). Thus,\nthe order of the transitions is M1 from 3 -to the intermediate level and E2 from that level to the ground state. Finally\nto have a ∆l = 1 from 3 -and ∆l = 2 to 1 -the only possible intermediate level is 2f 5. From the gamma energy,\nthis level is predicted to be 569keV above the ground state.\nNotice that considering the ground state to be\n+\nwould have led to a contradictory result here.\nc) Based on your previous answers and what you found in Problem 3, draw a scheme of the unclosed shell for 207Pb\nshowing the level occupancy for the ground state and the two first excited states (involved in the gamma decay) that\nexplain the various spins and parities you found.\nSee Figure 1\nProblem 5:\nThe life of Polonium IV: Radiation products\n10 points\na) What is the stopping power of the emitted alpha particles in Polonium? Do you need to worry a lot about their\neffects on nearby people?\nThe stopping power is\n-d E = (2πr2 Zα ln Λ)n 2m v2 ≈40barns ×84n\nm c2β-2 = 40 × 10-24\nx\ne β4\ne\ne α\nP o\ne\ncm2 × 84 ×\nd\n2.5 × 1022cm-3 × 0.511 MeV β-2 ≈42β-2MeV/cm. β can be calculated from the Q value you found in Problem 2,\nassuming that the speed is non-relativistic: Q = 1m\nαvα =\nmαc β , from which β2 = 2Q/(mαc2) ≈16/4000 =\n4 × 10-3. Finally we have -d E ≈104MeV/cm thus the alpha will most probably be stopped inside the Polonium.\nd x\nA second way to calculate this is the following: From -d E = σ n ∆E, with ∆E = 2m v2\nc\ne\ne\nE\nx\nα = 4\nme/mα ≈\nd\nMeV\nZ2\n480.511/4000\n≈4 × 10-3MeV.

Then λ′ =\nmec\nλ + 4πħ. In terms of frequencies, we have 2πc = 2πc + 4π\nħ\n′\n′\n. This gives\nω\nħω =\nmec\nħ.

Notice that even if ω ∝1/λ of course ∆ω = ω′ -ω = 2π .\nmec + ω\nmec +2 ω\n∆λ\nProblem 6:\nDeuteron\n12 points\nA simple model for the Deuteron is a square well with depth V0\nknown from experiments that the bound state has angular momentum l = 0 (that is, the state with l = 1 is unbound).\na) Use this knowledge and simple arguments requiring the wavefunction to \"fit\" in the well, to find the range of\nparameters V0 and R0 consistent with the experimental evidence.\nYou can take the neutron and proton mass to be both mc2 = 938MeV, ħc = 200MeV fm and consider the angular\nmomentum potential at the minimum distance\nħl(l+1)\nVl =\nμR2\n.\nHint: Note that this experimental evidence does not set a range for V0 and R0 separately.\nFor the deuteron to be bound in the center of mass square well, we need the wavefunction to fit inside the well. This\nhappens if the wavelength of the wavefunction is such that it has a negative slope at the boundary, or when λ/4 ≈R0.\nand width R (here we neglect the spin effects). It is\n\nThis sets the wavenumber to k ≈\nπ\n0 . The wavenumber is limited from above by the condition that the total energy\n2R\nis negative, or the kinetic energy is less than the potential depth:\nħk\n< V0. At the same time, we know that the\n2μ\nstates with\nare unbound. This means that\nħk\nħl(l+1)\nl ≥1\n> V0 -\n. With k =\nπ\n0 , we have then the conditions:\n2μ\nμR0\n2R\nħπ2 < V0R2\n0 < ħ\n2 + π\n. This sets a range of allowed values for the product V0R2\n8μ\nμ\n0.\nNow, μ = m/2 = 938/2MeV.

Then the kinetic energy is Ek = ħk′\n=\n2μ\nħk2\n=\nħ\n9π2 .

(Explain briefly)\nThe first three terms assume that the nucleus is a uniformly dense fluid (the Coulomb term is calculated assuming a\nuniformly charged sphere). The last two terms instead take into account quantum-mechanical considerations. The\nasymmetry term takes into account the fact that if we increased the number of neutrons - in order to decrease the\nnumber of protons and thus the Coulomb repulsion - these would have to occupy higher energy levels because of the\nPauli exclusion principle, leading to an higher total energy. The pairing term describes the tendency of nucleons to\npair up, to achieve zero angular momentum (and thus reduce the spin-orbit interaction).\nb) Consider the nuclear mass as given by the SEMF for A = 65. What is the shape of the curve M(Z, A = 65)?\nAt fixed, odd A (for which the pairing term is zero), the binding energy variation is given by the Coulomb and symmetry\nterm: B(Z) ∼cst.\nZ(Z\n(\n-a\n-1)\nA\n2Z)2\n-\nc\n1/3\nsym\nA\nA\nparabola as a function of Z (see figure 2).\n-1\nc) The minimum mass is reached for Zmin ≈A\n1 + 1A2/3\nac\n≈29.\nasym\nThis correspond to the isotope 65\n29Cu. Sketch the shape of the curve M(Z, A =\n65) and show approximately on the plot the Masses of 65\n29Cu and of its neighbor-\ning isotopes 65Ga, 65Zn, 65Ni and 65Co.\nThe Z number for each of the isotope is found from the periodic table and we\ncan make an approximate sketch.\nd) Since 65\n29Cu is the nuclide that is more tightly bound, it is the only stable nu-\nclide. By what process(es) do the other nuclides decay toward the stable nuclide?\nWrite the reactions involved, making sure to show all the decay products.\nBeta decay is responsible for achieving the stable configuration.

      "content": "22.02 Intro to Applied Nuclear Physics\nMid-Term Exam\nThursday March 18, 2010\nProblem 1: Short Questions\n40 points\n1. What is an observable in quantum mechanics and by which mathematical object is represented?\nAn observable in QM is any physical quantity that can be measured. Observables are represented by hermitian\noperators.\n2. How are the possible values of measurement outcomes of an observable determined?\nWhen measuring an observable, the possible outcomes of the measurement are given by the eigenvalues of\nthe operator associated with the observable, thus one has to solve the eigenvalue equation for the observable's\noperator. Since the observable is an hermitian operator, these eigenvalues are real.\n3. What is the probability of finding a particle described by the wavefunction ψ(x, y, z) in a small volume dV =\ndx dy dz around the position r = x,\n{ y, 0}?\nThe probability of finding the particle in a small volume dV = dx dy dz around the position r =\nx,\n{ y, 0} is\n|ψ( x, y, 0)|2dx dy dz.\n4. Is the evolution of a quantum mechanical system a stochastic (random) process?\nNo, the evolution of a QM system is deterministic (and governed by the time-dependent Schr odinger equation).\nOnly the result of a measurement is a stochastic variable.\n5. For a system described by the wavefunction ψ(x, t = t1) = a1w1(x) + a91w91(x) (where wn are energy\neigenfunctions with eigenvalues En) what is the probability of measuring an energy E = E91 at time t = t1?\nWhat about at time t = 2t1?\nIf we express a wavefunction as a linear combination of an observable eigenfunctions ψ = o anun, the\nn\nprobability of obtaining the nth eigenvalue is given by |an|2. Here then we have p(E91, t = t1) = |a91|2. The\nprobability of a particular energy does not change with time. More precisely, the wavefunction at a later time\n-iE1 (t-t1)/n\nwould be given by ψ(x, t) = a1w1(x)e\n+ a91w91(x)e-iE91 (t-t1)/n, but the probability p(E91, t =\nt2) = |a91e-iE91(t2 -t1)/n|2 = |a91|2 does not change\n6. Consider a particle described by the wavefunction φ(x) and an Hamiltonian with eigenvalues En and corre\nJ inf\nsponding eigenfunctions wn(x). Is the probability of obtaining the energy En given by p(En) =\ndx w∗ (x)φ(x)?\nn\n-inf\n|\nJ inf\nNo, the probability is given by the modulus square: p(En) =\ndx w∗ (x)φ(x)|2 (the inner product cor\nn\nresponds to calculating the coefficient an in the expansion φ(x) = o anwn).\n-inf\nn\n√\n7. A particle is in the quantum state ψ = B cos(\n2x).\na) What are the possible results of a momentum measurement?\nb) What are the probabilities of each possible momentum measurement?\nThe possible outcomes of a momentum measurement are all the momentum eigenvalues p = lk. The probability\nJ inf\nof each outcome is found as above by first calculating cn =\ndx u∗ (x)ψ(x), where un(x) = e±knx are the\nn\n-inf\neigenfunctions of the momentum and then taking the modulus square. Instead of calculating the integral, it\nis easier to realize that ψ can be directly be written as a linear combination of momentum eigenfunctions:\n√\n√\n√\n√\nB\ni\n2x\n-i\nψ =\n(e\n+ e\n2x). Then there are only two outcomes with non-zero probability,\n2l and -\n2l, both\nwith probability 1 .\nAe-i79kx\n8. A particle is in the quantum state, ψ =\n.\na) What are the possible results of a momentum measurement?\nb) What are the probabilities of each possible momentum measurement?\nc) What physical situation is represented by this quantum state?\nAs in the previous question, we obtain here that the only measurement outcome with non-zero probability is\np = -79lk, with probability 1. Notice that this wavefunction cannot be normalized. This state represents a\ntraveling wave (from right to left).\n\n9. A particle is in the angular momentum eigenstate, ψ = |l, mz) = |5, -4).\na) What would a measurement of the total angular momentum, L2, yield?\nThe eigenvalues of L2 are l2l(l + 1), thus we would measure 30l2\nb) What would a measurement of the z-component of angular momentum, Lz, yield?\nThe eigenvalues of Lz are lmz, thus we would measure -4l\nc) What would a measurement of the x-component of angular momentum, Lx, yield?\nSince the state is not in an eigenfunction of the Lx angular momentum, the result is a priori unknown. Because\nLz is known with absolute certainty, there is a maximum uncertainty in Lx. However, since the length of the\nangular momentum and its projection in the z direction are given, the possible values of Lx are limited. From\nL2\nL2\n=\n+ L2 + L2, and assuming L2 = 0 to find the maximum value for L2 (in absolute value) we obtain:\nz\ny\nx\ny\nx\n√\n√\nL2 ≤ L2 -L2\n= l2[l(l + 1) -m ] = l2(30 -16) = 14l2. Then -\n14l ≤ Lx ≤\n14l, with possible values\nx\nz\nz\nof Lx given by lmx, with mx integers. Finally we have then mx = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}.\n10. A nucleus consists of two spin 1/2 nucleons, s1 =\n, and, s2 =\n. Both nucleons are in the orbital angular\nmomentum l = 0.\na) How many spin states are there for each nucleon?\nEach nucleon can be in two states | 1\n2, + ) = |↑) and | , -1) = |↓), since -s ≤ ms ≤ s.\nb) How many spin states does the system have (based on the uncoupled representation)?\nIn the uncoupled representation we can list four possible states: |↑↑), |↑↓), |↓↑), |↓↓).\nc) Which quantum numbers would you use to label the coupled representation states? In the coupled represen\ntation a complete set of commuting observables is given by S2 Sz, S2 and S2, thus good quantum numbers are\ns, ms, s1, s2 (in this case, we can omit s1 and s2 since they're always 1 and write a state as |s, ms).)\nProblem 2: Eigenvalue problem\n15 points\nThe quantum mechanical observable Grades on the 22.02 Mid-Term has the eigenvalue problem,\nˆGφk = gkφk,\nk = 1, 2, 3, 4\nwith g1 =A, g2 =B, g3 =C, g4 =D and where φk are normalized eigenfunctions. If the state of the system is\nψclass = c1φ1 + √ φ2 +\nφ3 +\nφ4\nand assuming that the usual rules of Quantum Mechanics apply and that there are only 4 possible grades on the exam,\na) What is the probability of an A grade outcome?\nThe probability is given by |c1|2. Since the state needs to be normalized, we have |c1|2 = 1-( 1\n1 )= 1-10\n+\n+\n=\n3 .\nb) What is the average grade of the exam? (you can take A=5, B=4, C=3, D=2).\nThe average grade (or expectation value) is 5 3 + 4 1 + 3 4 + 2 1 =\n≈ B+ .\nc) Consider now the operator P\nPF (Pass/Fail), that obeys the following rules:\nPFφk = Pφk,\nfor k = 1, 2, 3\nP\nPFφ4 = Fφ4\nP\nwhere P and F are real number. Do the operators Gˆ and P\nPF commute? Give a mathematical reason for your answer.\nSince the two operators (Grade and Pass/Fail) share common eigenfunctions, they commute.\nMore precisely: since the two observable share common eigenfunctions, we can write\nˆ\nP F Gφ =\nPFφk = gk(PF )kφk\nk\ngkP\nP\n(where (PF )k = P for k = 1, 2, 3 and = F for k = 4. We also have\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nPFφk = G(PF )kφk = (PF )kGφk = (PF )kgkφk.\nGP\nThus we proved that for the 4 eigenfunctions: [P G]φk = 0.\nPF, ˆ = 0, we need to prove\nPF, ˆ\nNow, to state that [P G]\nthat [PF, ˆ]f = 0 for any function f. However, the eigenfunctions form a basis, so that any other function in the\nP G\nspace can be written as a linear combination of φk's: f = o\nk ckφk. It's then easy to prove that the previous relation\nˆ\nP F Gf = ˆPFf is valid for any function f.\nP\nGP\n\nProblem 3: Scattering\n25 points\na) (15 points) In the following figures you can see for a given potential profile a set of eigenfunctions (left column) and\na set of possible total energy values (right column) describing different scenarios of scattering for a particle incoming\nfrom the left side (here I plot the real part of the eigenfunction). You should match each figure in the left column with\nthe corresponding one in the right column (that is, indicate what energy of the particle gives rise to which scattering\nbehavior).\nThere are four regions of different potential heights. The behavior of the particle wavefunction will be different in\nevery region depending if the total energy is larger or smaller than the potential.\nA-4: The energy is E < V in region II and IV. Thus we expect the wave function to be an exponential decay in\nthese regions and a traveling wave in region I and III. The particle is a wave traveling from left to right in region I,\nthat reflects back and get transmitted into region II at the boudary. Its amplitude decreases in region II since there\nE < V , yielding a negative kinetic energy and an imaginary wave-number. After emerging into region III, the particle\nis again represented by a wave, with a reduced amplitude and with a smaller wave-number (hence a larger wavelength:\nλIII > λI). Finally the wavefunction penetrates in region IV, were it exponentially decays since again E < V there,\nwith κIV > κII.\nB-3: Here the energy is larger than the potential in all regions. We thus expect a traveling wave everywhere. The\namplitude is slightly larger in region I because here there is both an incoming and a reflected component (exact\namplitude ratios can be calculated by solving the full problem). The wavelengths in the four regions reflect the\nvariation in the difference E -V : we have λIV > λII > λIII > λI. At each step in the potential we will have a\npriori reflection and transmission of the wave.\nC-2: As E < V only in region IV we have a traveling wave (with different wavelenghts) in the first three regions\nfollowed by an exponential decay in the 4th. Again we have λII > λIII > λI, with kIV an imaginary number. The\nexact amplitudes could be calculated by solving the full eigenvalue problem with the given boundary conditions, as\nwell as setting some \"initial conditions\" (for example taking a situation that describes a particle coming from the left).\nAt each step in the potential we will have a priori reflection and transmission of the wave.\nD-1: In this case the energy is larger than the potential only in region I, thus the particle, initially a wave incoming\nfrom the left, get reflected at the first barrier and penetrates in region II, with an exponential decay. The rate of the\ndecay varies in the three regions, (with κ =\nJ\n2m(V -E)/l whe have: κIV > κII > κIII) although the decay is so\nfast that the drawing does not show the changes.\nx\nV(x)\nEnergy\nA-4\nx\nV(x)\nEnergy\nB-3\nV(x)\nEnergy\nx\nC-2\nV(x)\nD-1\nx\nEnergy\nb) (10 points) Match the 1D scattering energy eigenfunctions on the left with the correct potential profile (if any).\nProvide an explanation for your answer.\nHere the telling characteristic is the wavelength of the wavefunction in the three regions. We expect the wavefunction\nto always be a traveling wave, because the energy is always larger than the potential. The wavelength in region I and\n2πn\nIII is the same (λ = √\n), while in region II we expect a longer wavelength for the case A-2 (since E -VII < E\n2mE\n\nx\nEnergy\nV(x)\nEnergy\nV(x)\nx\nA-2\nB-1\nin that case) and a shorter wavelength for case B-1 (as there the potential is s.t. E -VII > E -VI, giving a larger\nkinetic energy, a larger wavenumber k and short wavelength λ = 2π/k).\nProblem 4: Alpha Particle Tunneling\n20 points\nA beam of alpha particles is directed at a potential barrier as indicated in the figure below. The beam has a high flux\nof, Γ = 6 × 1021 particles/sec. The energy of the alpha particles is E = 5 MeV , and the potential barrier height is,\nVB = 85 MeV and its width is L = 10 fm. You may assume the alpha rest mass to be mαc = 4000 MeV .\na) Make a drawing of the eigenfunction for this problem, assuming the alpha particles are shot in from the left.\nThe particle will be represented by a traveling wave from\nthe left (here I plot the real part of the wavefunction)\nwith an amplitude A for the incoming flux and R for\nthe reflected one traveling from right to left. Inside the\nbarrier the wavefunction has a complex wave-number\nκ =\nJ\n2m(VB -E)/l, thus it is represented by a de\ncaying exponential. The amplitude after the barrier is ap\nproximately |A|2Ptun so it will be much smaller. How\never the particle will still be represented by a traveling\nwave (only a component traveling from left to right) and\nit will have the same wavelength of the original wave,\nλ1 = λ3.\nb) Estimate the probability of tunneling, Ptun, through\nthe barrier. Write the generic formula for tunneling and then estimate the numbers quantitatively.\nThe approximate tunneling formula is given by Ptun = 4e-2κL (as seen in class, or Ptun = e-2κL as some of you\nmight have seen from 8.04. Since both these formulas are valid when Ptun ≈ 0 they are equivalent).\n2·4000 MeV·(85-5) MeV\n8000·80 fm-1\n4 fm-1\nWe have κ =\nJ\n2m(VB -E)/l =\nJ\n2mc2(VB -E)/(lc) =\n√\n=\n√\n=\n.\n200 MeV fm\n-2·4 fm-1 ·10 fm\nThus, the probability is Ptun = 4e\n= 4e-80 ≈ 4 × 10-35 (as you could have inferred from the graph).\nc) If the incoming beam is described by the wavefunction, ψ(x) = Aeikx calculate A that gives the flux Γ = p(x)v\n(where p(x)dx is the probability of finding the particle at {x, x + dx} and v the particle velocity).\nWe can calculate p(x) from the wavefunction amplitude as usual p(x) = |ψ(x)|2 = |A|2 . The particle velocity is\np\nnk\nnk\nΓm\ngiven by v =\n=\n. Thus we have Γ = |A|2\nfrom which we can calculate |A|2 =\n. The wave-number\nm\nm\nm\nnk\n√\n√\n√\nn\nk is calculated from\nk2 = E → k =\n2mE/l =\n2mc2E/(lc) =\n2 · 4000 MeV · 5 MeV/200 MeV fm =\n2m\n√\n6×1021 s-1\n1fm-1. Finally: |A| =\nJ\nΓmc2 =\nJ\n·4000 MeV\n= 2/ 10 fm-1/2. Alternatively, you could have\nnckc\n200 MeV fm·1·3×108m s-11015 m/fm\ncalculated the velocity from the kinetic energy v =\nJ\n2E/m =\nJ\n2 × 5 MeVc2/4000 MeV = c/20. And use this to\ncalculate |A|. Two remarks:\nYou can only calculate |A|, the full value of A could have a phase factor Aeiφ (that however is not observable).\n√\n|A| has dimensions of 1/ length. If you don't specify its unit, any numerical number you give is meaningless.\nd) Assuming the flux of alphas emerging from the barrier is Γtun = PtunΓ, how long should you wait to see an alpha\nparticle exit from the barrier? (you need to calculate the time τ such that Γtunτ = 1)\nΓ-1\n1 × 1035\nUsing the result above, we obtain τ =\n=\n·\n× 10-21s =\n× 1014s or about 130 thousand years.\ntun\nx\nV(x)\nE\nFigure 1: Scattering potential and wavefunction\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "22.02 Intro to Applied Nuclear Physics\nFinal Exam\nTuesday May 17, 2011\nSolution\nProblem 1:\nShort Questions\n20 points\nThese short questions require only short answers (but even for yes/no questions give a brief explanation)\n1)\nTrue or False: if nuclide A1X has a larger neutron scattering cross section than nuclide A2X′, A1X is a better\nmoderator than A2X′. (Explain)\nSolution:\nThis is true only if A1 ≈A2. Otherwise the lighter nuclide might be the best moderator, since the neutron can loose\nmore energy in each single collision.\n2) A sheet of paper can stop a beam of alpha particle. What type of collisions are responsible for this?\nIndicate the type of interaction and target.\nSolution:\nThe collisions are due to the Coulomb interaction with the electrons in the material. (Interactions with nuclei are rare\nand will not contribute substantially to the stopping down).\n3) Why is the sky blue?\nSolution:\nLight from the sun is scattered by the air via Rayleigh scattering. The probability of scattering (cross section) depends\non the frequency as σ ∝ω4, thus blue light is scattered more away from the sun than other wavelengths and it can\nreach our eyes, when we look away from the sun (looking in a direction closer to the sun we see light that has not been\nscattered, thus it is closer to the original mix of wavelengths: white light).\n4)\nBerillium-8 is an even-even nuclide (N and Z even) in which all the nucleons are paired off, leading to a very\nenergetically favorable configuration. Why then Be-8 is not found in nature?\n[Hint: what is the decay mode of Be-8?]\nSolution:\nBe-8 decays to two alpha particles: since alpha particles are so tightly bound, the decay from Be-8 to He-4 is so fast\nthat Be-8 cannot be found in nature. As hinted in the question, beta decay to either 8Li or 8B is not favorable (Q¡0)\nbecause of the pairing term.\n[Note: this was a tricky question, since we usually don't have alpha decay or f ssion for light isotopes, so I did not\ndetract many points for it]\n5)\nThe decay rates for gamma and beta decay can be obtain from the Fermi golden rule. What are the two factors\nthat determine the decay rates?\nSolution:\nBesides numerical factors, the Fermi golden rule is given by the product of the matrix element and of the density of\nstates. The f rst one gives the probability of a transition from the initial state to a f nal state. The second one multiplies\nthis probability by the number of states available, to f nally give the total transition rate.\n6) Fusion of two deuterium atoms is energetically favorable. Why then it does not happen unless we provide a lot of\nenergy to them?\nSolution:\nIn order to reach the deep potential well of the bound He-4, the two deuteriums have to overcome the Coulomb\npotential barrier.\n\n7)\nConsider a free particle in quantum mechanics, initially in a state ψ(x, t = 0) (for example a Gaussian\nwavepacket). What is the evolution of the expectation value of its position ⟨x⟩and velocity v ?\n(write at least the equations of motion d x\n⟨⟩\n⟨⟩\nv\n= . . . and d ⟨⟩= . . . ).\nd t\nd t\n8) Are the equations of motion you found in question 7 different than the classical equations of motion?\nHow would you answer change if the particle was moving in a potential?\nSolution:\nFrom Ehrenfest theorem, we have d ⟨x⟩= ⟨p⟩= m ⟨v⟩and d ⟨p⟩= -\n∂V\n= 0, since a \"free particle\" means that is\nd t\nd t\n∂x\nnot subjected to any potential or force and V = 0. Thus ⟨v⟩= v0 (its value at t = 0) and ⟨x(t)⟩= v0t + x0 (where\nx0 = ⟨x(0)⟩). The equation of motions thus give the classical result.\n\nIf we have a potential, we might have that\n∂V\n∂V (\n)\n=\n⟨x⟩(or ⟨F(x)⟩= F(⟨x⟩)) it the wavefunction is spread out in\n∂x\n∂⟨x⟩\nspace, thus the equation of motion for the q\n\nuan\n\ntum particle could differ from the classical case.\nProblem 2:\nRadioactive Decay I\n10 points\nMolybdenum-99 is produced in f ssion reactors, as one of the possible f ssion fragments. It decays to Technetium-99\nwith a half-life of 66 hours.\na) What is the type of radioactive decay? Write the nuclear reaction describing this decay.\nSolution:\nSince the mass number A is left unchanged, but the atomic number changes, the decay must be a beta decay. Specif -\ncally, it is Beta-minus β-decay:\n42Mo →99\n43 Tc + e-+ ν\nwhere the underlying decay converts one neutron into one proton:\nn →p + e-+ ν\nb)\nWhat is the Q-value of this decay? Describe qualitatively how this energy is distributed among the reaction\nproducts.\nSolution:\nGiven the atomic masses of Tc and Mo we can calculate the Q value:\nQ = [m (99\nA 42Mo) -mA( 9\n43Tc)]c2 = (98.90771 -98.90625)amu × 931.46MeV/c2/amu = 1.35993MeV\nSince we're using the atomic masses, the electron masses are already accounted for (notice this is different for β+\ndecay).\nThe energy is distributed between the electron and anti-neutrino (Tc is very heavy so it does not acquire much kinetic\nenergy due to conservation of momentum). The exact distribution of energy between electron and anti-neutrino can\nbe calculated from the Fermi-Golden rule (in particular the density of state part) which gives the spectra of the beta\ndecay (as calculated in class and plotted in the lecture notes, as well as you calculated in a Pset). Note that because\nthe mass of neutrino is very small we expect it to get more kinetic energy, as we infer from a simple conservation of\nenergy and momentum calculation.\nc)\nBonus question: A metastable level of Technetium-99 (Technetium-99m) is used as a gamma emitter in medical\nimaging. Its half life is about 6 hours (and it decays to the ground state of Technetium-99 by emitting gamma radiation).\nMolybdenum-99 produced from fission is transported to hospitals where its radioactive decay product, Technetium-\n99m, is extracted. What is the optimal time at which the largest amount of Technetium-99m can be extracted?\nSolution:\nMolybdenum decays as\nd NM = -λMNM(t)\nd t\nwhile Technetium-99m dynamics is given by\nd NT = λMNM(t)\nd t\n-λT NT (t)\n\nwith λM = log(2)/t 1 = 2.9\n× 10-6s-1 and λT = log(2)/t 1 = 32\n6s\n1.\n×\n-\n-\nThe optimum time is obtained when there is a maximum amount of Tc-99m, which can be calculated by putting the\ntime derivative to zero. This impose the condition that the activity of the two isotopes are equal at the optimum time:\nd NT = λMNM(topt) -λT NT (topt) = 0\nd t\n→\nAM(topt) = AT (topt)\nTo f nd the optimal time we still need an explicit expression for the time evolution of the activities.\nSolving the f rst equation (setting NM(t = 0) = N0) we have: NM(t) = N0e-λMt. The second equation is then\nd NT = λMN0e-λMt -λT NT (t)\nd t\nwith NT (t = 0) = 0. We can guess a solution of the form NT (t) = Ae-λMt +Be-λT t, with A and B two parameters\nto be determined:\nd NT = λMN0e-λMt -λT NT (t)\n→\n-λMAe-λMt -λT Be-λT t = λ\nλM\nMN0e-\nt -λT (Ae-λMt + Be-λT t)\nd t\nThe RHS equation is satisf ed for\nλM\nA = N0 λT -λM\nand\nλM\nB = -N0 λT -λM\nThus giving:\nλM\nNT (t) = N\nT\n(e-λMt\n-\nλT -λM\n-e\nλ t)\nThe maximum quantity of Technetium-99m is found for d NT = 0 or NT = N\nλM\nd t\nλT e-λMt\nλM\n(e-λMt\nλ\n-e-λT t\nM\n) =\ne-λMt\nλT -λM\nλT\nλ\n→\nM\nλT (e-λMt -e-λT t) = (λT -λM)e-λM t\n→\ne-(λT -λM)t = λT\nthus we f nd:\nλM\ntopt = log\nM\nλ\n\n/(λT -λ\n)\nT\n≈22 hours\nProblem 3:\nShell Model\n20 points\na) Based on the shell model, what is the spin and parity of the ground states of Molybdenum-99and of Technetium-99?\nSolution:\nMolybdenum-99 has 57 neutrons. The most likely spin-parity assignment is\n+\n7 , or maybe\n+\nif the orbit term is\nconsidered. [Note: it turns out to be\n+\nbut we can't obtain this result from a simple picture of the shell model].\nTechnetium-99 has 43 protons. In the valence nucleon model, the last unpaired proton determines the spin and parity\nof the nuclide. The proton occupies the 1g 9 level, thus Technetium-99 has spin 9 and parity +,\n+\nb) Consider now Technetium-99. The first two excited states of Technetium-99 have very similar energy. Their spin-\nparity assignments are\n+\n(E1 = 140.511 keV) and 1 -(E2 = 142.63keV). Explain the spin and parity of these two\nexcited states. Draw a scheme of the energy levels involved (including the ground state) and which levels the nucleons\noccupy (you might want to indicate filled states with filled circles and empty states with empty circles).\nSolution:\nThe f rst excited state is explained by having the unpaired proton jump to the level 1g 7, which in the next shell (after\nthe magic number 50).\n\nFigure 1: Shell-model conf guration for Technetium. Note that students proposed different conf gurations for the\nsecond excited state (in the gray box). While the conf guration on the left in the gray box is ok, it most probably would\nhave higher energy than what found experimentally. The conf guration on the right is not acceptable since it leaves\nthree unpaired nucleons.\nThe second excited state is obtained by having one proton in the closed shell 2p 1 being promoted to the ground state\nlevel 1g 9. The unpaired proton is now in the 2p 1 shell, yielding 1 -spin parity.\nc)\nThe third excited state of Technetium-99 is the level 2d 5, as we would have expected from a naive picture of the\nenergy arrangement in the nuclear shell model. What characteristic of the nuclear force makes the energy of the level\nwith spin/parity 1 -(the second excited state) smaller than the energy of the level 2d 5?\nSolution:\nWe expect the level 2d 5 to be higher in energy than the conf guration 2p 1 -(with a closed shell1g 9) because of a\ncombination of the pairing term and spin-orbit coupling: the angular momentum dependence of the nuclear force\nmakes leaving unpaired nucleons with higher angular momentum less favorable (more energetic).\nd) The spin-orbit potential\nV 0\nV\n=\nso ˆ\nso\nħ2 l · ˆs explains the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited\nstate of Technetium-99.\nGiven the energy difference between the first excited state and the ground state (E1 = 140.511 keV), what is the value\nof V 0\nso for Technetium-99?\nSolution:\nThe difference in energy is given by ∆E = Vso|1g 7 -Vso|1g 9 . For a given value of the total and orbital angular\nmomentum, the spin-orbit coupling is calculated as:\nV 0 ˆ\nV 0\nso· ˆ\nVso =\nl s = Vso =\nso ħ(I(I + 1) -l(l + 1)\nħ2\nħ2\n-s(s + 1))\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nsince we have the vector operator relationship: I2\n\nˆ\n\nˆ\nˆ\n= (l + s)2 = l2 + s2 + 2l · s and given the value of the operators\nˆI2\nˆ\nwhen the system is in an eigenstate with eigenvalue\nħI(I + 1). Here I is the total angular momentum, what we\nˆ\ncall the \"spin\" of the nucleus. S is the last unpaired nucleon spin, which has always eigenvalue\nħs(s + 1) with s = 1\nˆ\nand L is the angular momentum (with eigenvalue\nħl(l + 1) identif ed by the shell spectroscopic notation: here l = 4\nfor a g-shell).\nSince l (and s) is the same for the two states, we have\n0 7 7\n9 9\n∆E = Vso[I1(I1 + 1) -I0(I0 + 1)] = Vso[ (\n+ 1) -\n(\n+ 1)] =\n2 2\n-V 0\nso 2\nFilled-up Shells\nFilled-up Shells\n2d5/2\n1g7/2\n1g9/2\n2p1/2\nFilled-up Shells\nFilled-up Shells\nFilled-up Shells\nground, 9/2+\n1st excited, 7/2+\nFilled-up Shells\n3rd excited, 5/2+\n2nd excited, 1/2-\nAlternatives configurations for 2nd excited\nok\nwrong\n2d5/2\n1g7/2\n1g9/2\n2p1/2\n\nShell order\ngy\n2d5/2\n3rd excited\n2d5/2\nEner\n1g7/2\n2p1/2\n2nd excited E=142.6keV\nE3\n1g7/2\n1st excited E=140.5keV\n1g9/2\nM4 (E5)\nM1,E2\n2p1/2\n1g9/2\nGround E=0\nFigure 2: Gamma decays from the f rst two excited states of Tc-99. Note that although the shell order is as given in\nthe left, the actual order of the energy levels (when ordered by energy) is as in the right side. Three transitions are\npossible, even when not considering the third excited level.\nThen we have V 0\nso = -140.511keV × 2 =\n-31keV .\nNote that since I = l ± 1, we had also seen in lecture that we can also always write: ∆E = -V 0\nso(l +\n) =\n-V 0\nso(4 + 1) = -V 0 9\nso .\nProblem 4:\nRadioactive Decay II\n20 points\nConsider the gamma decay from the two f rst excited levels of Technetium-99.\na) What are the allowed multipole transitions for each one of the three possible decays? Specify if there are possibly\ncompeting multipoles.\nSolution:\nThere are three possible decays:\n+\n+\n1g 7\n1g 9 ,\n∆Π = no,\n→\n≤l≤8\nM1, E2, (M3, E4, M5, E6, M7, E8)\n2p\n-\nΠ\n→\n+\n1g 9 ,\n∆\n= yes,\n≤l≤5\nM4, (E5)\n2p 1 -\n→\n+\n1g 7 ,\n∆Π = yes,\n≤l≤4\nE3, (M4)\nThe f rst decay allows odd magnetic multipoles and even electric multipoles. Thus we expect to have two competing\ndecays, M1 and E2.\nThe second and third decays allow instead odd electric multipoles and even magnetic multipoles. Thus the second\ndecay will be M4 (with maybe E5 competing) and the third E3. In this last case, we don't expect to have competing\nprocesses, because it would have much smaller decay rate.\nNote that than we are considering \"decay\" processes, in which some energy is released (in the form of a gamma\nphoton) the transition is always from the excited state (which has more energy) to the ground state (see f gure).\nb) Estimate the decay rates for each transition (use the formulas given at the end of the exam sheet).\nSolution:\nWe can use the formulas in the appendix to estimate λ for the four multipoles found above, using A=99. Notice that\nthe energy to be considered for the third decay is ∆E3 = E2 -E1 = 142.63 -140.511keV = 2.12keV We obtain:\nλ(M1) = 1.55 × 1011s-1\nλ(E2) = 1.83 × 106s-1\nλ(M4) = 1.08 × 10-9s-1\nλ(E3) = 6.39 × 10-14s-1\nc) Based on your answer above and the 6 hours lifetime of Technetium-99m can you identify the excited energy level\nthat corresponds to Technetium-99m? If not, what other radioactive process could be happening that could lead to the\nobserved lifetime (by accelerating some of the decays)?\nSolution:\nThe decay from 1g 7 is too fast, while the decay from 2p 1 is too slow. Thus the level 2p 1 (that we can identify with\nTc-99m) must be decaying by internal conversion at a faster rate than gamma decay to explain the observed lifetime.\n\nInternal conversion is a decay process that is always present and can have faster rates that gamma decay in some cases,\nas here.\nd) Although long-lived, Technetium-99 is not stable. By what radioactive process does its ground state decay? (write\nthe nuclear reaction describing this decay).\nSolution:\nWe can f rst eliminate alpha decay, since the mass number is too low to allow it. Then we should decide if Tc-99\ndecays by β-or β+/electron capture processes. Note that the last two processes would create Molybdenum-99 again,\nbut we know this is not possible, since the opposite decay happens.\nThen, we f nd that Tc-99 decays by β-decay to Ruthenium-99 (99\n44Ru):\n43T c →99\n44 Ru + e-+ ν\ne) The daughter nuclide of Technetium-99 can be also obtained from the decay of an isotope of Rhodium. What is the\ndecay type? (write the reaction). Use the semi-empirical mass formula to explain this fact.\nSolution:\nRuthenium-99 can be obtained also from Rhodium-99 by changing one proton into a neutron. The two reactions that\nmake this possible are β+ decay and electron capture:\n45Rh →9\n44 Ru + e+ + ν\n4 R\nh + e-→44 Ru + ν\nIt turns out that electron capture is the actual decay mode (although you could not have known, but you should at least\nlisted the possibility).\nNuclides try to reach an optimal value of their Z/N ratio, as it can be explained by the mass parabola obtained from\nthe semi-empirical mass formula plotted for a f xed A as a function of Z (see lecture notes for the plot of the mass\nparabola).\nProblem 5:\nNeutron Scattering and Capture by Hydrogen\n20 points\na) Consider the elastic scattering of neutrons of energy E0 by Hydrogen initially at rest. What is the mean energy of\nthe Hydrogen after one collision with a neutron? What is the variance of the Hydrogen energy?\n[Hint: start from what you know about the energy distribution of neutrons]\nSolution:\nIn the elastic scattering of a neutron by a proton the two particles share the f nal energy. We know that the probability\nfor the neutron to have f nal energy\n(A+1)2\nE\n1 is P(E1) =\n=\n, which is a uniform distribution between αE0 and\n4AE0\nE\nE0 (here α = 0). See the lecture notes on how we obtained this p\n0robability distribution function: qualitatively this is\ndue to the variation in the angle at which the two particle are scattered.\nThen the probability for the proton to have an energy Ep is P(Ep)dEp = P(E1)dE\n1 =\nfor Ep ∈[0, E0]. Then\nE0\nthe mean energy of the proton is ⟨E ⟩= 1E and the variance\n∆E2\nE0\np\n=\np\nEp -⟨Ep⟩=\n.\nNote: the variance of a random variable is calculate by calculating the me\n\nan (\n\nor average) as:\n⟨E⟩\nZ inf\nE0 1\nE\n=\nP(E)E dE\n→\nhere :\n-inf\nZ\nE dE =\nE0\n2E0\nand the second moment:\n\nE2\n=\nZ inf\nE0 1\nE3\nP(E)E2 dE\n→\nhere :\nE2 dE =\nE\n3E\n-inf\nZ\nand then taking the difference:\nE2\nE2\n\nE2\np\n\n-⟨\n⟩2\nE\n=\np\n3 -\nE\n=\n0 .\n\nYou can review probability concepts on the notes (from Griff th) that I had posted some time ago.\nb) Now consider the synthesis of deuterium D from the collision of a neutron and a proton.\nThe reaction is a neutron capture reaction, n+H→γ+ D or H(n,γ)D. What is the energy of the gamma photon\nemitted?\nSolution:\nThe gamma photon will carry out the Q energy released in the reaction. Thus we need to calculate Q:\nQ = c2[m(H) + m(n) -m(D)] = [(938.272 + 0.511 + 939.565) -2.014 × 931.46]MeV = 2.39MeV\nHere I approximated the atomic mass of the hydrogen by the sum of the proton and electron mass (neglecting the\nbinding energy).\nc) In many neutron reaction capture AX(n,γ)A+1X some of the energy released in the reaction is given to the A+1X\nnuclide, which is left in an excited state A+1X∗.\nCan this happen in the neutron capture reaction producing deuterium, H(n,γ)D?\nWhat does this imply about the relative values of the scattering cross section σsc and the capture cross section σcp of\na neutron by Hydrogen? (which one is larger?)\nSolution:\nDeuterium does not have any bound excited state, thus the only possible reaction leading to the formation of deuterium\nis the one in which the gamma possess all the energy Q generated in the reaction. In practice, if some of this energy\nwould to be given to the deuterium, the nucleus would again split apart in a neutron and a proton. This process would\nbe then just a (possibly inelastic) collision. We can deduce that the probability of a collision is much higher than the\ncreation of a deuterium: in other words, σsc ≫σcp.\nd)\nThe neutron and proton that collide can have their spins aligned or anti-aligned. Does the probability of a\ncollision leading to neutron capture instead of elastic scattering depend the spins of proton and neutron being aligned\nor anti-aligned? Explain.\n[Hint: What is the total spin of deuterium?]\nSolution:\nA proton and a neutron are different particles, so we do not have to worry about the Pauli exclusion principle. They\nboth have spin-1/2, so their possible states are (in the coupled and uncoupled representations):\ns = 1, ms = + 1\n\np\ns = 1, ms = + 1\np\ns = 1, ms = + 1\n=\n\nn\n|↑↑⟩\n\ns = 1, ms =\n-1\n\n= |↑↓⟩\ns =\n, m\n\ns = -\n\n+\np\ns = 1, ms =\ns\n= 1\n\n= 1, ms =\n, ms =\n-1\ns\np\n-1\nn\n= |↓↑⟩\n\nS = 0, Ns =\n\n,\nn\n=\nn\n|↓↓⟩\n|\n0⟩=\n|↑↓⟩-|↓,↑⟩\n√\n|S = 1, Ms = -1⟩=\n|↓, ↓⟩\n|\n,\n+\n,\nS = 1, Ms = 0⟩=\n|↑↓⟩\n|↓↑⟩\n√\n|S = 1, Ms = 1⟩=\n|↑, ↑⟩\nNote that the total spin can only be S = 0, 1 (no negative values!!) while for each value of S we have Ms =\n-S, -S + 1, . . . , 0, . . . , S.\nThe only bound state of deuterium has total spin S = 1. This spin state is reached if the spins of proton and neutron\nare aligned but also if they are anti-aligned. In this last case however, the spins can either form the desired triplet (with\nS = 1) but also a singlet (i.e. the state with S = 0); if this is the case, then neutron capture and deuterium formation\ncannot happen. Thus we expect that the probability of neutron capture is higher if the spins are aligned (and conversely\na lower scattering cross-section).\ne) Bonus question: Denote by σc\n↑↑\np the cross-section for neutron capture if the neutron and proton spins are aligned\nand σc\n↑↓\np the cross-section if the two nucleons are anti-aligned. Assuming that the collision and capture does not\nchange the spins of neutron and proton, what is the ratio σc\n↑↓\np/σc\n↑↑\np? (you do not need to find an explicit expression for\nthese cross-section to answer this question).\n\nSolution:\nIf we neglect spin effects, we would have a cross section σcp. If the two nucleons are aligned, the cross section\nis unchanged, since they can in all the case fusion to form deuterium, σc\n↑↑\np = σcp. However if the nucleons are\nantialigned, only in half of the cases they are going to be in the triplet state S = 1 that lead to a bound state, thus\nσc\n↑↓\np = 1σcp and the ratio of the two cross-sections is σc\n↑↓\np/σ\nc\n↑↑\np =\n.\nProblem 6:\nTime Evolution\n10 points\nConsider again a neutron and a proton (before the collision).\nAssume that at time t = 0 the proton is in the state |ψ(0)⟩p = S = 1, ms = + 1\n=\np, while the neutron is the\np\n|↑⟩\nstate |ψ(0)⟩\n= 1\n√\nS\n√\nn\n= 1, m\ns = +\n+\nS =\n, ms =\nn\n\n|↓⟩n\n-\n=\n.\nn\n2|↑⟩n +\nThe states\n\n= + 1\n\nS = 1, ms\n\n= |↑⟩\n\nand\n\nS = 1, m\ns = -\n\n= |↓⟩are eigenstates of the spin Hamiltonian, with\nenergies E+ and E\nrespectively.\n-\na) What is the state of the proton at a time t > 0? What is the state of the neutron at the same time?\nSolution:\nSince it is in an energy eigenstate, the evolution of the proton is simply |ψ(t)⟩\n= e-iE+t/ħ\np\n|↑⟩p. Notice that this is\nonly an \"apparent\" evolution, since it does not change any observable property of the proton.\nThe evolution of the neutron is instead given by:\n|ψ(t)⟩\n=\ne-iE\nħ\n+t/\n√\nn\n|↑⟩n +\ne-iE-t/ħ\n|↓⟩n\nwhich is a different state than the initial one.\nb)\nWhat is the probability for the two spins to be aligned at a time t? (assume that the two particle evolve indepen-\ndently)\nSolution:\nSince the state of the proton does not really change with time and it's always |↑⟩p = S = 1, ms = + 1\n, we have\np\nto f nd the probability for the neutron to be as well in the state |↑⟩n =\nS = 1, m\n\n.\n\ns = + 1\nThis is given by\nn\n|⟨↑|ψ(t)⟩\nt\nn|2 = | 1e-iE+ /ħ|2 = 1.\nc) Bonus question: What is the probability at time t for the proton and neutron to be in a (common) state with total\nspin S = 1?\nSolution:\nThe probability of having spin S = 1, P1 is the probability of not having spin S = 0, P1 = 1 -P0. In turns,\nP0 = |⟨S = 0, ms = 0|ψp(t)ψn(t)⟩|2\n√\n=\n⟨↑↓| -⟨↓↑|\n|\n√\n\ne-iE+t/ħ\n|↑↑⟩+\ne-iE-t/ħ\n|↑↓⟩\n!\n|2\n√\n= |√\ne-iE-t/ħ\n2 2\n⟨↑↓|↑↓⟩|2 =\n.\nThus, P1 = 1 -3 = 5.\n\nAppendix: Useful Formulas and Constants\nMasses: Proton mass, mpc2 = 938.272 MeV; Neutron mass, mnc2 = 939.565 MeV; Deuteron mass = 2.014amu;\nElectron mass=0.511 MeV.

Give a condition in terms of the system energy E and potential energy V .\n8) Is the Q-value of a nuclear reaction (such as alpha-decay) the only factor that determines if the reaction does happen\nspontaneously?\nProblem 2:\nRotations and angular momentum\n26 points\na) Consider classical rotations in a 3D Euclidean space. We define Rn(θ) the operator describing a rotation around\nthe axis n by an angle θ. Do the operators Rz(θ) and Rz(φ) commute? Do the operators Rx(θ) and Ry(φ) commute?\n(a yes/no answer is enough)\nb) Now we consider rotations in quantum mechanics. We write rotations as the operators ˆRn(θ).\nFor small angles θ we can write these rotations using the angular momentum operator as ˆR\nθ ˆ\nn(θ) = 1 -i ħLn (for\nexample ˆR (θ) = 1 -i θ ˆ\nx\nħLx). Do rotations in quantum mechanics commute?\nc) Calculate the difference between making first a rotation Ry(φ) followed by a rotation Rx(θ) and making first\nRx(θ) and then Ry(φ). Can you express this difference as a rotation?\nd) A quantum system is in a state ψ such that it is left unchanged by a rotation along x: ˆRx(θ)ψ = ψ.\nIs ψ an eigenfunction of ˆLx?\ne) We studied in class that the eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator along x, ˆLx, are ħmx with integers\nmx = -l, -l + 1, . . . , l. Consider a quantum state ψ =\n6φ\n2 + 2φ\n0 +\nφ\n√\nq\n1,\ni\n-\nwhere φm s the normalized\neigenfunction of ˆLx corresponding to the eigenvalue ħmx.\nWhat is the probability of finding ˆLx = 0 in a measurement?

Given its A and Z numbers, do you\nexpect this isotope to be stable?\nA possible decay channel for 131\n63 Eu is proton emission. We want to analyze this decay mode following the same\ntheory we saw for alpha decay and in particular estimate the half-life of 131\n63 Eu. The following questions will guide\nyou through the estimation.\nb) The mass of Samarium-130 is 120980.755 MeV. What is the Q-value for the reaction 131\n63 Eu →130\n62 Sa +1\n1H?\nc) Calculate the frequency f = v\nR for the proton to be at the edge of the Coulomb potential.

      "content": "22.02 Intro to Applied Nuclear Physics\nMid-Term Exam\nThursday March 17, 2011\nSolution\nProblem 1:\nShort Questions\n24 points\nThese short questions require only short answers (but even for yes/no questions give a brief explanation)\n1) What information about a quantum system can you obtain from the wavefunction?\nSolution:\nThe wavefunction contains all possible information about the state of a quantum system. Thus from the wavefunction\nit is possible to extract information about the probability of measurement outcomes for any observable (thus also the\nexpectation values of the observables). The probability distribution function of the system position (obtained from the\nabsolute value square of the wavefunction) is just one of the .\n2)\nIf we measure the kinetic energy of a quantum particle and immediately after we measure its momentum, is the\nresult of the second measurement random?\nSolution:\nNo: if the momentum measurement gave an outcome p = ħk, then the kinetic energy is\n=\nħk2\nT\n=\np\n. This\nm\nm\nis because the momentum measurement projects the wavefunction of the system into a momentum eigenfunction\n(wavefunction collapse) and this momentum eigenfunction is also an eigenfunction of the kinetic energy since the two\noperators commute.\n3) What does the Coulomb term in the Semi-empirical mass formula describe?\nSolution:\nThe Coulomb term describes a decrease in the biding energy due to the Coulomb repulsion among protons in the\nnucleus. Thus for a given mass number A, it is less favorable to have a large number of protons. The Coulomb term\ndependence on A and Z is found from a simple model of the nucleus as a spherical charge.\n4) A particle is in the quantum state, ψ(y) = Ae-iπy.\na) What are the possible results of a momentum measurement?\nb) What are the probabilities of each possible momentum measurement?\nc) What physical situation is represented by this quantum state?\nSolution:\na) The outcomes of a momentum measurement are the momentum operator eigenvalues, which span all real numbers.\nGiven the system's state however, only one result has non-zero probability, since the state is an eigenfunction of the\nmomentum operator. The corresponding eigenvalue is p = -ħπ.\nb) Since there is only one non-zero probability, the probability of finding p = -ħπ is equal to one.\nc) This quantum state represent a free, unbound, system (i.e. a system that does not feel the effects of any potential).\nThe system is better represented by a flux of particle with wavenumber k traveling in the -y direction.\n5) When is the wavefunction describing a quantum system an energy eigenfunction?\nSolution:\nWhen the wavefunction is stationary or time-independent. In that case it has to satisfy the time-independentSchr odinger\nequation which is the energy eigenvalue equation. Another case is when the wavefunction has collapsed into an energy\neigenfunction just after the measurement of the energy (it will then remain in that state, since it will be a stationary,\ntime-independent state).\n6)\nWhich one of the following statements (if any) is correct, based on the properties of the angular momentum and\nits eigenfunctions?\na) A particle is in the angular momentum eigenstate, ψl,mz(θ, φ) = |l=3, mz=-4⟩.\n\nb) A particle is in the angular momentum eigenstate, ψl,mx,mz(θ, φ) = |l=4, mx=3, mz=-2⟩.\nc) A particle is in the angular momentum eigenstate, ψl,mx(θ, φ) = |l=4, mx=3⟩.\nSolution:\nWe know that the eigenvalues of L2 and the components Lx, Lz, Ly have to satisfy the relationship: -l ≤m ≤l.\nThus the first statement is incorrect.\nThe second statement is also not possible because Lx and Lz do not commute, thus there cannot be a common\neigenfunction of the two operators with a fixed mx and mz. The last statement is instead a valid eigenfunction of the\nangular momentum operator.\nNote: many of you tried to answer this question from considerations regarding the relationship ˆL2\nˆ\n= L2\nˆ\nx + L2\nˆ\ny + L2\nz.\nIf we apply this equation to the state |l=3, mz=-4⟩, this gives:\nħ3(3 + 1) |l=3, mz=-4⟩= (Lˆ2\nx + Lˆ2\ny) |l=3, mz=-4⟩+\nħ42 |l=3, mz=-4⟩\nChanging the order of the equation we obtain it implies that |l=3, mz=-4⟩is an eigenfunction of the operator ˆL2\nˆ\nx + L2\ny,\nwith eigenvalue -4ħ2:\nˆ\n(L2\nˆ\nx + L2\ny) |l=3, mz=-4⟩=\nħ(3(3 + 1) -42) |l=3, mz=-4⟩= -4 2\nħ|l=3, mz=-4⟩\nHowever the operator ˆ\n(L2\nˆ\nx + L2\ny) should have positive eigenvalues: Thus the state |l=3, mz=-4⟩cannot be an eigen-\nfunction of ˆL2 ˆ\n, Lz.\nNote that the equations above are operator equations, or, when applied to functions, equations involving functions.\nThey are not directly equations involving the eigenvalues alone. Thus I cannot state the implication:\nˆL2\nˆ\n= L2\nˆ\nx + L2\nˆ\ny + L2\nz\n→\nħl(l + 1) =\nħm2\nx +\nħm2\nħ\ny +\nmz\nThe only thing I can state is if I consider the expectation value of the operators wrt a valid eigenfunction:\n⟨\n| ˆ2 |\n⟩\n⟨\n| ˆ2 |\n⟩\n⟨\n| ˆ\nˆ\nl, mz L\nl, mz = l, mz Lx l, mz + l, m\nz Ly |l, mz⟩+ ⟨l, mz| Lz |l, mz⟩\n→\nħl(l + 1) = ⟨l, mz| ˆ\nˆ\nL2\nx |l, mz⟩+ ⟨l, mz| L2\ny |l, m\nħ\nz⟩+\nm2\nz\n|l, mz⟩is not an eigenfunction of ˆLx and ˆLy so the previous equation is not correct.\n7)\nWhen is a quantum system \"bound\"? Give a condition in terms of the system energy E and potential energy V .\nSolution:\nA quantum system is bound in a given region of space when its energy E > V (x) in that region of space, but\nE < V (x) everywhere else, such as in a potential well (with no possibility to ever escape via tunneling). If the well is\nnot infinite, the wavefunction penetrates outside the potential well region (as a decaying exponential): even when this\nhappens, the state is still considered bound.\n8)\nIs the Q-value of a nuclear reaction (such as alpha-decay) the only factor that determines if the reaction does\nhappen spontaneously?\nSolution:\nNo. Although the Q-value for some reactions might be favorable, they still don't happen if there is a large potential\nbarrier (e.g. the Coulomb barrier) that lead to a negligible tunneling probability.\nProblem 2:\nRotations and angular momentum\n26 points\nNote: This problem only required very simple answers based on what you know about commutators and operator\nproperties (the only thing you needed to know about angular momentum is that the various component do not com-\nmute). Since many of you found it hard, I am giving below very detailed calculations. This was not needed nor\nrequired of you (each answer could have taken 3 lines) but hopefully it will help the understanding.\na) (2 points) Consider classical rotations in a 3D Euclidean space. We define Rn(θ) the operator describing a\nrotation around the axis n by an angle θ. Do the operators Rz(θ) and Rz(φ) commute? Do the operators Rx(θ) and\nRy(φ) commute? (a yes/no answer is enough)\n\nSolution:\nRz(θ) and Rz(φ) commute (as any two rotations along the same axis) while Rx(θ) and Ry(φ) do not commute (as\nany two rotations along two different axes).\nb) Now we consider rotations in quantum mechanics. We write rotations as the operators ˆRn(θ).\nFor small angles θ we can write these rotations using the angular momentum operator as ˆRn(θ) = 1 -i θ ˆ\nħLn (for\nexample ˆ\nˆ\nRx(θ) = 1 -i θ\nħLx). Do rotations in quantum mechanics commute?\nSolution:\nAs rotation along different axes are written in terms of angular momentum operators that do not commute, we expect\nthem not to commute. We can prove this by calculating the commutator:\nθ\nφ\n[Ra(θ), Rb(φ)] = [1 -i\nLa, 1\nL\nħ\n-i\nb]\nħ\nThe commutator of a sum, [A + B, C + D] is calculated by expanding out each term: [A + B, C + D] = [A, C] +\n[A, D] + [B, C] + [B, D] (as you can verify from the definition of commutator).Then\nφ\nθ\nθ\nφ\nθφ\n[Ra(θ), Rb(φ)] = [1, 1] + [1, -i\nLb] + [-i\nLa, 1] + [-i\nLa, -i\nLb] = -\n2 [La, Lb]\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\nwhere we used the fact that a scalar always commutes with everything. Because of the commutation properties of the\nangular momentum operator, we know that if a = b (e.g., a = b = x) we have [Lx, Lx] = 0 and the rotation commute.\nHowever, if a = b then the two rotation do not commute. This is similar to the classical result.\nc)\nCalculate the difference between making first a rotation Ry(φ) followed by a rotation Rx(θ) and making first\nRx(θ) and then Ry(φ). Can you express this difference as a rotation?\nSolution:\nThis difference is nothing else than the commutator [Rx(θ), Ry(φ)] = Rx(θ)Ry(φ) -Ry(φ)Ry(θ). Given what we\ncalculate above, thus is given by:\nθφ\nθφ\n[Rx(θ), Ry(φ)] = -\n2 [Lx, Ly] = -i\nLz\nħ\nħ\nNote that this can be written as a rotation around the z axis, [Rx(θ), Ry(φ)] = Rz(θφ) -1.\n---\nWe could also have calculated explicitly the two cases:\nθ\nφ\nθ\nφ\n1st case: Rx(θ)[Ry(φ)[ψ]] = (1 -i\nLx)[(1 -i\nLy)[ψ]] = (1 -i\nLx)[ψ -i\nLy[ψ]] =\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\nφ\nθ\nθ\nφ\nθφ\n= ψ -i\nLy[ψ] -i\nLx[ψ] -i\nLx[-i\nLy[ψ]] = ψ -i (φLy[ψ] + θħLx[ψ]) -\n2 Lx[Ly[ψ]]\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\nφ\nθ\nφ\nθ\n2nd case: Ry(φ)[Rx(θ)[ψ]] = (1 -i\nLy)[(1 -i\nLx)[ψ]] = (1 -i\nLy)[ψ\n=\nħ\n-i\nLx[ψ]]\nħ\nħ\nħ\nθ\nφ\nφ\nθ\nθφ\n= ψ -i\nLx[ψ] -i\nLy[ψ] -i\nL\nħ\ny[-i\nLx[ψ]] = ψ -i (φLy[ψ] + θ Lx[ψ])\nLy[Lx[ψ]]\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\n-ħ2\nThe two expressions are the same except for the terms ∝θφ\nħ2 where Lx, Ly appear in different order:\nθφ\nθφ\nθφ\n1st case - 2nd case = -\n2 (Lx[Ly[ψ]] -Ly[Lx[ψ]]) = -\n2 [Lx, Ly][ψ] = -i\nLz[ψ]\nħ\nħ\nħ\nthus we obtain the same result.\nd) A quantum system is in a state ψ such that it is left unchanged by a rotation along x: ˆRx(θ)ψ = ψ.\nIs ψ an eigenfunction of ˆLx?\nSolution:\nψ is an eigenfunction of ˆRx with eigenvalue 1. Because Rx and Lx commute, ψ must be an eigenfunction of ˆLx as\nwell.\n\n---\nWe can verify this by using the definition of ˆRx:\nθ\nθ\nˆRx(θ)ψ = ψ\n→\n(1 -i\nLx)ψ = ψ\n→\n-i\nLxψ = 0 ψ\nħ\nħ\nThus ψ is an eigenfunction of Lx with eigenvalue 0, since Lxψ = 0 ψ.\ne)\nWe studied in class that the eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator along x, ˆLx, are ħmx with integers\nmx = -l, -l + 1, . . . , l. Consider a quantum state ψ =\n√\n6φ-2 + 1\n2φ0 +\n12φ , where φm is the normalized\neigenfunction of ˆLx corresponding to the eigenvalue ħmx.\nq\nWhat is the probability of finding ˆLx = 0 in a measurement? What is\nD\nˆLx\nE\n?\nSolution:\nThe probability of obtaining a particular eigenvalue mi in a measurement is given by P\ni = |⟨ψ|φi⟩| , where φi is the\neigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue mi. Thus the probability of finding the zero eigenvalue of Lx, ħ× 0 is\n|⟨ψ|φ0⟩|2 = 1\n4.\nSimilarly, we can find the probabilities of mx = -2 and 1 to be 1\n6 and 7\n12 respectively. Then the expectation value (or\naverage) is simply:\nħ\n⟨Lx⟩= -2ħ\n+ 0ħ\n+ ħ\n=\n---\nNote that the inner product can be calculated very easily since we know that for normalized eigenfunctions the inner\nproduct ⟨φi|φj⟩is zero for two different eigenfunctions (they are orthogonal) and one if i = j:\n⟨ψ|φ0⟩= ⟨√φ\n+\nφ +\nφ φ\n=\nφ\nφ\n+\nφ φ\n+\nφ φ\n=\n0+\n1+\n0 =\n-2\nr\n|\n0⟩\n√\n6⟨\n-2\n|\n⟩\n2⟨\n|\n0⟩\nr\n⟨\n1|\n⟩\n√\n6×\n2×\nr\n12×\nSimilarly we can calculate ⟨ψ|φ\n=\n-2⟩\n√\n6 and ⟨ψ|φ1⟩=\nq\nħ\n12. From ψ we thus have that P(Lx = -2 ) = P\n=\n-\n6,\nP(Lx = 0ħ) = P0 = 1\n4, P(L\nħ\nx =\n) = P1 = 12 (all the other Pi are zero) and the expectation value of Lx (or its\naverage) is\nD\nˆL\nE\n= P m P\n= -2\n1 + 0\nħ\nħ\nħ\nx\ni\ni\ni\n4 + ħ12 = ħ\n4. We can as well use the usual definition of expectation\nvalue:\n⟨Lx⟩= ⟨ψ| Lx |ψ⟩=\n*\n√φ\n2 +\nφ0 +\nr\nφ1\nLx\n√φ\n2 +\nφ0 +\nφ\n-\n-\nr\n+\nor using the explicit definition of inner product in terms of an integr\n\nal:\n\n⟨Lx⟩=\nZ\nψ∗Lx[ψ]d3r =\nZ\n(√φ\nφ0 +\nr\nφ1)∗Lx[\nφ\n-2 +\n2 +\nφ0 +\nφ1]d3r\n√\n-\nr\nNow,\nr\nLx[√φ\n2 +\nφ0 +\nφ1] = -2ħ√φ\n2 + 0ħφ\n-\n-\n0 + ħ\nr\nφ1\nbecause the φi are eigenfunctions of Lx. Thus the integral is:\n⟨Lx⟩=\nZ\n(√φ\n2 +\nφ0 +\nr\nφ1)∗(\n-\n-2ħ\n√φ\n-2 + 0ħφ0 + ħ\n=\nr\nφ1)d3r\n=\nZ\n1 1\n(-2ħφ∗\n2φ\n2)d3r +\nZ\n(-2ħ√\nφ∗\nZ\nħ\n0φ\n2)d3r + · · · +\nφ∗\n1φ\n1 d r\n-\n-\n6 2\n-\nwhere I expanded out (but not written explicitly) all the products. Since the φi are eigenfunctions, we know that they\nare orthonormal, thus,\nZ\nφ∗\ni φid3r = 1,\nZ\nφ∗\ni φj d3r = 0\nThen the only terms remaining from the above integral are:\nħ\n⟨Lx⟩= -2ħ\n+ 0ħ\n+ ħ\n=\n\nNote that this expression is exactly the same we found by considering the probabilities:\n⟨L\nħ\nħ\nħ\nx⟩=\nX\nmi |⟨ψ|φi⟩| =\nX\nmi |ci| =\nX\nmi Pi\ni\ni\ni\nThis result is of course very general as you have already seen in recitation: we can always write any wavefunction\nψ = P\ni ciφi where φi are eigenfunctions of the operator A we want to calculate the expectation value of (since the\nφi form a basis and ci = ⟨φi|ψ⟩).

Given its A and Z numbers,\ndo you expect this isotope to be stable?\nSolution:\nThe ratio of the mass and proton number is Z/A ≈0.48. We know that for heavy stable nuclei this ratio is instead\n≈0.41 (Z ≈A/2 only for light nuclides). Thus we expect this isotope to be unstable and to decay by a process\nthat will make it shed some protons. A possible decay channel for 131\n63 Eu is proton emission. We want to analyze this\ndecay mode following the same theory we saw for alpha decay and in particular estimate the half-life of 131\n63 Eu. The\nfollowing questions will guide you through the estimation.\nb)\n(5 points) The mass of Samarium-130 is 120980.755 MeV. What is the Q-value for the reaction 131Eu →130\n62 Sa\n+1\n1H?\nSolution:\nThe Q-value can be calculated from the mass differences:\nQ = mEu -mp -mSa = 0.939MeV\nc) (6 points) Calculate the frequency f = v for the proton to be at the edge of the Coulomb potential. Here R is the\nR\nSamarium radius and v the proton speed when taking Q as the (classical) kinetic energy.\nSolution:\nFrom the Q calculated above we can obtain the velocity as 1\n2mpv2 = Q or,\nv =\ns\n2Q\n2 c = 0.045c = 1.34\nmpc\n× 1022fm/s\nIn this calculation I assumed that the proton has all the kinetic energy, while the daughter nuclide is still at rest. This\nis in any case a good approximation, given the masses. A more precise calculation can be obtained if we consider\nconservation of momentum, mSavSa + mpv = 0, to find:\nv =\ns\n2Q\nc = 0.045c = 1.34\n1022fm/s\nmpc (1 + mp/mSa)\n×\n(the result is the same to the second decimal place).\nThe nuclear radius is given by R = R0A1/3 = 6.079 fm. Thus the frequency is f = v = 2.21 × 1021 s\nR\n-.\nNote: as in the alpha decay model, we could have worked in the center of mass frame and use the reduced mass and\ntotal radius in the calculation above. Since the proton is much smaller (in terms of mass and radius) than Samarium,\nthe difference in the two calculations is negligible.\n\nd) (5 points) What is the Coulomb potential at the distance R, VC(R)? (this is the potential barrier height).\nWhat is the distance Rc at which the Coulomb potential is equal to the Q-value?\nSolution:\nThe Coulomb potential is given by\ne2Z\ne2\nZ\nV\nħ\nC(R) =\n=\nc\n=\n197MeV fm\n= 14.65MeV\nR\nħc\nR\n6.079fm\nNote: because the fine constant e2\nħ\n=\n137 was given in cgs units, the Coulomb potential could be calculated from\nc\nit in cgs units. Since it is a dimensionless constant, I could have written as well\ne2\n0ħ\n=\n137 in SI units and\nπo\nc\nVC(R) =\ne2Z\n4πo0 .\nR\nTo find the distance Rc we equate the Coulomb potential to the Q-value:\ne2Z\ne2Z\nV\n= Q\nc\n→\nC(R)\nRC =\n= R\n= 94.84fm\nR\nQ\nQ\ne)\n(4 points) To estimate the tunneling probability we replace the Coulomb barrier with a rectangular barrier of\nheight VH = VC(R)/2 and length L = (Rc -R)/2 (see figure). What is the tunneling probability?\nSolution:\nSince we want to estimate the tunneling probability, we take the approximate expression PT = 4e-2κL. We first need\nto calculate κ:\np\n2m(V\nc2\nH -Q)\np\n2mp\n(VC/2\nκ =\n=\n-Q) = 0.55fm-1\nħ\nħc\nWe then have 2κL = 48.58. Reading out from the graphic, this corresponds to P\n= 4e-2κL ≈4 × 10-21\nT\n(if instead\nwe had a good scientific calculator we would get PT = 3.19 × 10-21). Since the tunneling probability is very low, the\napproximation we took in considering P\n2κL\nT = 4e-\ninstead of the exact expression is a good one.\nf) Finally, give the decay rate λ and the half-life for the proton emission decay of 131\n63 Eu.\nSolution:\nThe decay rate is obtained from the same semi-classical model we studied for alpha decay. Thus it is given by the\nproduct of the frequency at which the proton is at the potential barrier (or gets separated from the parent nuclide) times\nthe probability of tunneling through the barrier. Thus the decay rate is given by λ = fP\nT = 7.05s-and the half life\nis t 1\n2 = ln 2/λ = 0.1s.\nQ\nVC\nMeV\nR\nRc\nR\nRc\nQ\nVH\nMeV\nL\n10-16\n10-19\n10-22\n10-13\n10-25\ne-x\nProblem 4:\nMatch the potential\n20 points\nA quantum system in a 1D geometry is subjected to the potential energy as in the figures on the right, with 5 regions\nof different potential height. Match the 1D energy eigenfunctions on the left with the correct energy (if any) depicted\non the right. Provide a brief explanation of the reasoning that lead you to each of your matchings.\n(Notice: here I plot the real part of the eigenfunction).\n\nSolution:\nA-4: The wavefunction in A is always an oscillating\nfunction, so it corresponds to a traveling wave with\nalways positive kinetic energy. This means that E >\nV in all the five regions\nB-1: The wavefunction shows exponential decay in\ntwo regions (II and IV), thus it must have negative ki-\nnetic energy there, or E < V .\nC-2: Here the wavefunction is oscillating except in re-\ngion 4, where it is an exponential decay. Thus we have\nE < VIV\nD-3: In this case, the energy of the system is greater\nthan the potential only in region III. Thus the system is\nconfined to that region: the system is bound. The so-\nlution will thus have an oscillating behavior in region\nIII and just a small penetration in the outer regions as\nit decays exponentially to zero.\nE-2: As in the C case, the wavefunction is oscaillat-\ning in all the regions except in region 4, where it looks\nlike an increasing exponential. This stationary solu-\ntion corresponds to the same potential as above, but\nwith different boundary conditions: the particle is now\nincoming from the right instead than the left as we\nmostly solved in class.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Is the particle bound?\nh) A system is subject to a potential V (x) and is found in two possible states described by two different wavefunctions.\nThe first wavefunction is an eigenfunction of the momentum while the second wavefunction is an eigenfunction of the\nHamiltonian. Which wavefunction describes a stationary state? Why?\nProblem 2: Temperature\n13 points\nm\na) In classical thermodynamics, the temperature of an ideal gas (in 1D) is given by T =\nv (where kB is the\nkB\nBoltzmann constant, m the mass and v the velocity). Define the corresponding quantum mechanical observable in\nterms of observables seen in class.\nb) Consider a \"gas of particles\" inside an infinite well (V (x) = 0 for 0 < x < L and infinite otherwise). Each particle\nis in the state\nWhat is the expectation value (average) of the temperature?\n[Note: you should be able to solve this problem without doing any integral!]\nr\n3πx\n10πx\n11πx\nψ(x) =\nsin\n+\nsin\n+\nsin\n2L\nL\nL\nL\n2L\nL\n\nr\n\nr\n\nProblem 3: Scattering\n12 points\nA source of neutrons produces a flux of neutrons of intensity Φinc and energy E. To protect the worker, in front of\nthe source a wall of thickness L has been built, which we can model with a potential barrier V > E. To monitor her\nhealth, the worker wears a detector that measure the neutron flux.\na) Sketch a simple drawing showing how you model this problem (assume we leave in a 1D world!). Show in the\nsketch the characteristics of the wavefunction describing the neutron.\nb) What is the flux of neutrons measured by the detector? Assume a simple model for the tunneling, in the limit\nwhere the tunneling probability is small: this means that you do not need to solve completely the problem to find the\n-approximate- answer.\nProblem 4: Spontaneous Fission\n30 points\nUseful quantities: lc = 197MeV fm; e 2 =\n; c = 3 × 108m/s; R0 = 1.25fm.\n~c\nA note about this problem: Because of the small and large quantities involved, small rounding errors give very\ndifferent results. This is ok in the Midterm, but if you want to calculate something like this in real life, make sure you\npay attention to numerical errors.\nAlso, although the final answer does give you an idea about the fact that Cm can indeed undergo spontaneous fission,\nestimating the fission rate in this way is a bad approximation, since we expect Cm to fission not in just these two\nfragments but to lead to a distribution of possible pairs of fragment, all accompanied by the release of some neutrons.\nThis would be a 3 (or larger) body problem, which complicates estimates.\na) Consider the isotope Curium-250 (250Cm), with mass 232.938 GeV. Given its A and Z numbers, do you expect this\nisotope to be stable?\nCurium-250 is the lightest nuclide to undergo spontaneous fission as the main decay mode. We want to analyze this\ndecay mode following the same theory we saw for alpha decay and in particular estimate the half-life of 250Cm. The\nfollowing questions will guide you through the estimation.\nb) Assume that the spontaneous fission leads to the decay:\nCm →\nTe78 +44 Ru76\nWhat is the Q-value for the reaction? How does this compare to the usual Q-value for typical alpha decay?\n[The mass of 250Cm is 232.938GeV, the mass of 130Te78 is 121.002 GeV and the mass of 120Ru76 is 111.724GeV]\nc) What is the Coulomb potential VC (R) = Q1Q2 at the distance R = RT e + RRu, where RX is the nuclear radius?\nR\nWhat is the distance Rc at which the Coulomb potential is equal to the Q-value?\nd) We want to estimate the probability of tunneling for an effective particle in the center of mass frame of the Tellurium\nand Ruthenium nuclei (with reduced mass μ).\nTo estimate the tunneling probability we replace the Coulomb barrier with a rectangular barrier of height VH = VC (R)\nand length L = (Rc - R). What is the tunneling probability?\ne) Besides the tunneling probability, to calculate the spontaneous fission rate we need to calculate the frequency\nv\nf =\nfor the reduced effective particle to be at the edge of the Coulomb potential. Here v is the reduced particle\nR\nspeed inside the nuclear well (depth V0 = 35MeV) when taking Q as the (classical) energy.\nf) Finally, give the decay rate λ and the half-life for spontaneous fission of Curium 250.\nProblem 5: Match the potential\n21 points\nA quantum system in a 1D geometry has energy as shown by the green line and is subjected to the potential energy as\nin the figures labeled A-C, with 3 or 5 regions of different potential height.\nFor each figure 1-7, state whether the curve plotted is a good energy eigenfunction for one (or more!) of the potentials\nand energies in Fig. A-C. Provide a brief explanation of the reasoning that lead you to your conclusion.\n\n(Notice: here I plot the real part of the eigenfunction).\nE\nV\nA\nE\nV\nE\nV\nB\nC\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The chapter is meant to setup a\ncommon language for the rest of the material we will cover as well as rising questions that we will answer later on.\n1.1.1 Terminology\nA given atom is specified by the number of\n- neutrons: N\n- protons: Z\n- electrons: there are Z electron in neutral atoms\nAtoms of the same element have same atomic number Z. They are not all equal, however. Isotopes of the same\nelement have different # of neutrons N .\nA\nIsotopes are denoted by\nXN or more often by\nZ\nA\nZ X\nwhere X is the chemical symbol and A = Z + N is the mass number. E.g.: 92 U,238 U [the Z number is redundant,\nthus it is often omitted].\nWhen talking of different nuclei we can refer to them as\n- Nuclide: atom/nucleus with a specific N and Z.\n- Isobar: nuclides with same mass # A (6= Z, N).\n- Isotone: nuclides with same N, 6= Z.\n- Isomer: same nuclide (but different energy state).\n\n1.1.2 Units, dimensions and physical constants\n1.6 × 10-19\nNuclear energies are measured in powers of the unit Electronvolt: 1eV =\nJ. The electronvolt corresponds\nto the kinetic energy gained by an electron accelerated through a potential difference of 1 volt. Nuclear energies are\nusually in the range of MeV (mega-electronvolt, or 106eV).\nNuclear masses are measured in terms of the atomic mass unit : 1 amu or 1u = 1.66 × 10-27kg. One amu is equivalent\nto 1/12 of the mass of a neutral ground-state atom of 12C. Since electrons are much lighter than protons and neutrons\n(and protons and neutrons have similar mass), one nucleon has mass of about 1amu.\nBecause of the mass-energy equivalence, we will often express masses in terms of energy units. To convert between\nenergy (in MeV) and mass (in amu) the conversion factor is of course the speed of light square (since E = mc2). In\nthese units we have: c = 931.502 MeV/u.\n- Proton mass: 938.280MeV/c2 .\n- Neutron mass: 938.573MeV/c2 .\n- Electron mass: 0.511MeV/c2 .\nNote: you can find most of these values in Krane (and online!)\nScales of magnitude for typical lengths are femtometer (1fm=10-15m) also called Fermi (F) and Angstrom 1 =\nA\n10-10m (for atomic properties) while typical time scales span a very broad range.\nPhysical constants that we will encounter include the speed of light, c = 299, 792, 458 m s-1, the electron charge,\ne = 1.602176487 × 10-19 C, the Planck constant h = 6.62606896 × 10-34 J s and ~, Avogadro's number Na =\n6.02214179 × 1023 mol-1 , the permittivity of vacuum o0 = 8.854187817 × 10-12 F m-1 (F=Faraday) and many\nothers. A good reference (online) is NIST: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/index.html\nThere you can also find a tool to convert energy in different units:\nhttp://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/energy.html\n1.1.3 Nuclear Radius\nThe radius of a nucleus is not well defined, since we cannot describe a nucleus as a rigid sphere with a given radius.\nHowever, we can still have a practical definition for the range at which the density of the nucleons inside a nucleus\napproximate our simple model of a sphere for many experimental situations (e.g. in scattering experiments).\nA simple formula that links the nucleus radius to the number of nucleons is the empirical radius formula:\nR0A1/3\nR =\n1.2 Binding energy and Semi-empirical mass formula\n1.2.1 Binding energy\nTwo important nuclear propert that we want to study are the nuclear binding energy and the mass of nuclides.\nYou could think that since we know the masses of the proton and the neutron, we could simply find the masses of all\n?\nnuclides with the simple formula: mN = Zmp + Nmn. However, it is seen experimentally that this is not the case.\nFrom special relativity theory, we know that to each mass corresponds some energy, E = mc2. Then if we just sum\nup the masses of all the constituents of a nucleus we would have how much energy they represent. The mass of a\nnucleus is also related to its intrinsic energy. It thus makes sense that this is not only the sum of its constituent\nenergies, since we expect that some other energy is spent to keep the nucleus together. If the energy were equal, then\nit wouldn't be favorable to have bound nuclei, and all the nuclei would be unstable, constantly changing from their\nbound state to a sum of protons and neutrons.\nThe binding energy of a nucleus is then given by the difference in mass energy between the nucleus and its constituents.\nA\nFor a nucleus\nthe binding energy B is given by\nZ XN\n\nB = Zmp + Nmn - mN (AX)\nHowever, we want to express this quantity in terms of experimentally accessible quantities. Thus we write the nuclear\nmass in terms of the atomic mass, that we can measure, mN (AX)c = [mA(AX) - Zme]c + Be, where mA(AX)\nis the atomic mass of the nucleus. We further neglect the electronic binding energy Be by setting mN (AX)c =\n[mA(AX) - Zme]c .\n\nc2\n\nWe finally obtain the expression for the nuclear binding energy :\nFig. 1: Binding energy per nucleon (B/A in MeV vs. A) of stables nuclides (Red) and unstable nuclides (Gray).\nQuantities of interest are also the neutron and proton separation energies:\nZ XN ) - B(A-1\nSn = B(A\nXN-1)\nZ\nSp = B(Z\nAXN ) - B(A-1XN )\nZ-1\nwhich are the analogous of the ionization energies in atomic physics, reflecting the energies of the valence nucleons.\nWe will see that these energies show signatures of the shell structure of nuclei.\n1.2.2 Semi-empirical mass formula\nThe binding energy is usually plotted as B/A or binding energy per nucleon. This illustrates that the binding energy\nis overall simply proportional to A, since B/A is mostly constant.\nThere are however corrections to this trend. The dependence of B/A on A (and Z) is captured by the semi-empirical\nmass formula. This formula is based on first principle considerations (a model for the nuclear force) and on experi\nmental evidence to find the exact parameters defining it. In this model, the so-called liquid-drop model, all nucleons\nare uniformly distributed inside a nucleus and are bound together by the nuclear force while the Coulomb interaction\ncauses repulsion among protons. Characteristics of the nuclear force (its short range) and of the Coulomb interaction\nexplain part of the semi-empirical mass formula. However, other (smaller) corrections have been introduced to take\ninto account variations in the binding energy that emerge because of its quantum-mechanical nature (and that give\nrise to the nuclear shell model).\nThe semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF) is\nM(Z, A) = Zm(1H) + Nmn - B(Z, A)/c2\nwhere the binding energy B(Z, A) is given by the following formula:\n(A - 2Z)2\nA-3/4\nB(A, Z) = avA - asA2/3 - acZ(Z - 1)A-1/3 - asym\n+δap\nA\nր\n↑\nvolume\nsurface\nWe will now study each term in the SEMF.\n↑\nCoulomb\n↑\nsymmetry\nտ\npairing\nB =\n\nZmp + Nmn -[mA(AX) -Zme]\n\nc2\n\nA. Volume term\nThe first term is the volume term avA that describes how the binding energy is mostly proportional to A. Why is\nthat so?\nRemember that the binding energy is a measure of the interaction among nucleons. Since nucleons are closely packed\nin the nucleus and the nuclear force has a very short range, each nucleon ends up interacting only with a few\nneighbors. This means that independently of the total number of nucleons, each one of them contribute in the same\nway. Thus the force is not proportional to A(A - 1)/2 ∼ A2 (the total # of nucleons one nucleon can interact with)\nbut it's simply proportional to A. The constant of proportionality is a fitting parameter that is found experimentally\nto be av = 15.5MeV.\nThis value is smaller than the binding energy of the nucleons to their neighbors as determined by the strength of the\nnuclear (strong) interaction. It is found (and we will study more later) that the energy binding one nucleon to the\nother nucleons is on the order of 50 MeV. The total binding energy is instead the difference between the interaction\nof a nucleon to its neighbor and the kinetic energy of the nucleon itself. As for electrons in an atom, the nucleons are\nfermions, thus they cannot all be in the same state with zero kinetic energy, but they will fill up all the kinetic energy\nlevels according to Pauli's exclusion principle. This model, which takes into account the nuclear binding energy and\nthe kinetic energy due to the filling of shells, indeed gives an accurate estimate for av.\nB. Surface term\nThe surface term, -asA2/3, also based on the strong force, is a correction to the volume term. We explained the\nvolume term as arising from the fact that each nucleon interacts with a constant number of nucleons, independent of\nA. While this is valid for nucleons deep within the nucleus, those nucleons on the surface of the nucleus have fewer\nnearest neighbors. This term is similar to surface forces that arise for example in droplets of liquids, a mechanism\nthat creates surface tension in liquids.\nSince the volume force is proportional to BV ∝ A, we expect a surface force to be ∼ (BV )2/3 (since the surface\nS ∼ V 2/3). Also the term must be subtracted from the volume term and we expect the coefficient as to have a\nsimilar order of magnitude as av. In fact as = 13 - 18MeV.\nC. Coulomb term\nThe third term -acZ(Z -1)A-1/3 derives from the Coulomb interaction among protons, and of course is proportional\nto Z. This term is subtracted from the volume term since the Coulomb repulsion makes a nucleus containing many\nprotons less favorable (more energetic).\nTo motivate the form of the term and estimate the coefficient ac, the nucleus is modeled as a uniformly charged\nsphere. The potential energy of such a charge distribution is\n3 Q2\nE = 4πo0 5 R\n( r d3\nsince from the uniform distribution inside the sphere we have the charge q(r) =\nπr3ρ = Q\nand the potential\nR\nenergy is then:\nR\nq ~r)\nq(~r)\nq(r)\nE =\ndq(~r)\n=\nd3~r ρ\n=\ndr πr2ρ\n|~r|\n4πo0\n|~r|\n4πo\nr\nR\nR\n3 Q2\n3Q\nr 3 1\nQ2r\n=\n4π\ndr\nr 2Q\n=\ndr\n=\nR6\n4πo0\n4πR3\nR\nr\n4πo0\n4πo0 5 R\nUsing the empirical radius formula R = R0A1/3 and the total charge Q2 = e2Z(Z - 1) (reflecting the fact that this\nterm will appear only if Z > 1, i.e. if there are at least two protons) we have :\nQ2\ne2Z(Z - 1)\n=\nR0A1/3\nR\nwhich gives the shape of the Coulomb term. Then the constant ac can be estimated from ac ≈ 3\ne\n, with\n5 4πo0 R0\nR0 = 1.25fm, to be ac ≈ 0.691 MeV, not far from the experimental value.\nπo\nZ\n(\no\nZ\n\nZ\n(\no\n\nZ\n\nZ\n!\n=\n\n!\n\nVolume\nVolume + Surface\nVolume + Surface+Coulomb\nVolume + Surface+Coulomb+Asymmetry\nFig. 2: SEMF for stable nuclides. We plot B(Z, A)/A vs. A. The various term contributions are added one by one to arrive at\nthe final formula.\nD. Symmetry term\nThe Coulomb term seems to indicated that it would be favorable to have less protons in a nucleus and more neutrons.\nHowever, this is not the case and we have to invoke something beyond the liquid-drop model in order to explain\nthe fact that we have roughly the same number of neutrons and protons in stable nuclei. There is thus a correction\nterm in the SEMF which tries to take into account the symmetry in protons and neutrons. This correction (and the\nfollowing one) can only be explained by a more complex model of the nucleus, the shell model, together with the\nquantum-mechanical exclusion principle, that we will study later in the class. If we were to add more neutrons, they\nwill have to be more energetic, thus increasing the total energy of the nucleus. This increase more than off-set the\nCoulomb repulsion, so that it is more favorable to have an approximately equal number of protons and neutrons.\n(A-2Z)2\nThe shape of the symmetry term is\n. It can be more easily understood by considering the fact that this term\nA\ngoes to zero for A = 2Z and its effect is smaller for larger A (while for smaller nuclei the symmetry effect is more\nimportant). The coefficient is asym = 23MeV\nE. Pairing term\nThe final term is linked to the physical evidence that like-nucleons tend to pair off. Then it means that the binding\nenergy is greater (δ > 0) if we have an even-even nucleus, where all the neutrons and all the protons are paired-off.\nIf we have a nucleus with both an odd number of neutrons and of protons, it is thus favorable to convert one of\nthe protons into a neutrons or vice-versa (of course, taking into account the other constraints above). Thus, with\nall other factor constant, we have to subtract (δ < 0) a term from the binding energy for odd-odd configurations.\nFinally, for even-odd configurations we do not expect any influence from this pairing energy (δ = 0). The pairing\nterm is then\nA-3/4\n+ap\neven-even\nA-3/4\n+δap\n=\n0 even-odd\n-apA-3/4 odd-odd\nwith ap ≈ 34MeV. [Sometimes the form ∝ A-1/2 is also found].\n1.2.3 Line of Stability in the Chart of nuclides\nBy taking the first derivative wrt Z we can calculate the optimal Z such that the mass is minimum. We obtain:\n\n1A-1/3\nac\n\n1+\nA\nasym\nZmin =\n1A2/3\nac\n1 + 4\nasym\n)-1\n)\nA\n1 A2/3 ac\nA\nac\nA2/3\n≈\n1 +\n≈\n1 -\nasym\nasym\nwhich gives Z ≈ A at small A, but has a correction for larger A such that Z ≈ 0.41A for heavy nuclei. [ Note the\napproximation and series expansion is taken because ac ≪ asym]\nIf we plot Z/A vs. A the nuclides lie between 1/2 and 0.41. There is a line of stability, following the stable isotopes\n(red in figure 4 and black in figure 3). The isotopes are then variously labeled, for example here by their lifetime.\nInteractive information is available at http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/.\n\n+\n\n(c) Brookhaven National Laboratory.

This decay, or loss of energy, results in an atom of one type, called the parent nuclide, transforming\nto an atom of a different type, named the daughter nuclide.\nThe three principal modes of decay are called the alpha, beta and gamma decays. We will study their differences and\nexact mechanisms later in the class. However these decay modes share some common feature that we describe now.\nWhat these radioactive decays describe are fundamentally quantum processes, i.e. transitions among two quantum\nstates. Thus, the radioactive decay is statistical in nature, and we can only describe the evolution of the expectation\nvalues of quantities of interest, for example the number of atoms that decay per unit time. If we observe a single\nunstable nucleus, we cannot know a priori when it will decay to its daughter nuclide. The time at which the decay\nhappens is random, thus at each instant we can have the parent nuclide with some probability p and the daughter\nwith probability 1 - p. This stochastic process can only be described in terms of the quantum mechanical evolution\nof the nucleus. However, if we look at an ensemble of nuclei, we can predict at each instant the average number of\nparent an daughter nuclides.\nIf we call the number of radioactive nuclei N, the number of decaying atoms per unit time is dN/dt. It is found that\nthis rate is constant in time and it is proportional to the number of nuclei themselves:\nd N = -λN(t)\nd t\nThe constant of proportionality λ is called the decay constant. We can also rewrite the above equation as\ndN/dt\nλ = - N\nwhere the RHS is the probability per unit time for one atom to decay. The fact that this probability is a constant is\na characteristic of all radioactive decay. It also leads to the exponential law of radioactive decay :\n-λt\nN(t) = N(0)e\nWe can also define the mean lifetime\nτ = 1/λ\nand the half-life\nt1/2 = ln (2)/λ\nwhich is the time it takes for half of the atoms to decay, and the activity\nA(t) = λN(t)\n\nSince A can also be obtained as\n, the activity can be estimated from the number of decays ΔN during a small\n\ntime δt such that δt ≪ t1/2.\nA common situation occurs when the daughter nuclide is also radioactive. Then we have a chain of radioactive decays,\neach governed by their decay laws. For example, in a chain N1 → N2 → N3, the decay of N1 and N2 is given by:\ndN1 = -λ1N1dt,\ndN2 = +λ1N1dt - λ2N2dt\nAnother common characteristic of radioactive decays is that they are a way for unstable nuclei to reach a more\nenergetically favorable (hence stable) configuration. In α and β decays, a nucleus emits a α or β particle, trying\nto approach the most stable nuclide, while in the γ decay an excited state decays toward the ground state without\nchanging nuclear species.\n1.3.1 Alpha decay\nIf we go back to the binding energy per mass number plot (B/A vs. A) we see that there is a bump (a peak) for\nA ∼ 60 - 100. This means that there is a corresponding minimum (or energy optimum) around these numbers. Then\nthe heavier nuclei will want to decay toward this lighter nuclides, by shedding some protons and neutrons. More\nspecifically, the decrease in binding energy at high A is due to Coulomb repulsion. Coulomb repulsion grows in fact\nas Z2, much faster than the nuclear force which is ∝ A.\nd N\nd t\n\nS\nchematic of\n\nalph\na par tic le dec ay, sh owing the particle as a nucleus of He-4.\n\nThis could be thought as a similar process to what happens in the fission process: from a parent nuclide, two daughter\nnuclides are created. In the α decay we have specifically:\nA\nA-4\n′\nZ XN -→\nXN -2 + α\nZ-2\nwhere α is the nucleus of He-4: 2He2.\nThe α decay should be competing with other processes, such as the fission into equal daughter nuclides, or into pairs\n12C\nincluding\nor 16O that have larger B/A then α. However α decay is usually favored. In order to understand this,\nwe start by looking at the energetic of the decay, but we will need to study the quantum origin of the decay to arrive\nat a full explanation.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\nA. Energetics\nIn analyzing a radioactive decay (or any nuclear reaction) an important quantity is Q, the net energy released in the\n′\n′\ndecay: Q = (mX - mX - mα)c . This is also equal to the total kinetic energy of the fragments, here Q = TX + Tα\n(here assuming that the parent nuclide is at rest).\nWhen Q > 0 energy is released in the nuclear reaction, while for Q < 0 we need to provide energy to make the\nreaction happen. As in chemistry, we expect the first reaction to be a spontaneous reaction, while the second one\ndoes not happen in nature without intervention. (The first reaction is exo-energetic the second endo-energetic).\nNotice that it's no coincidence that it's called Q. In practice given some reagents and products, Q give the quality of\n√1\nthe reaction, i.e. how energetically favorable, hence probable, it is. For example in the alpha-decay log (t1/2) ∝\n,\nQα\nwhich is the Geiger-Nuttall rule (1928).\nThe alpha particle carries away most of the kinetic energy (since it is much lighter) and by measuring this kinetic\nenergy experimentally it is possible to know the masses of unstable nuclides.\nWe can calculate Q using the SEMF. Then:\nB(A-4\n′\nQα =\nXN-2) + B(4He) - B(A\n= B(A - 4, Z - 2) - B(A, Z) + B(4He)\nZ XN )\nZ-2\nWe can approximate the finite difference with the relevant gradient:\nSince we are looking at heavy nuclei, we know that Z ≈ 0.41A (instead of Z ≈ A/2) and we obtain\nQα ≈-36.68 + 44.9A-1/3 + 1.02A2/3 ,\nwhere the second term comes from the surface contribution and the last term is the Coulomb term (we neglect the\npairing term, since a priori we do not know if ap is zero or not).\nQα = [B(A -4, Z -2) -B(A, Z -2)] + [B(A, Z -2) -B(A, Z)] + B(4He) ≈= -4∂B\n∂A -2∂B\n∂Z + B(4He)\n= 28.3 -4av + 8\n3asA-1/3 + 4ac\n\n1 -Z\n3A\nZ\nA1/3\n\n-4asym\n\n1 -2Z\nA + 3apA-7/4\n\nThen, the Coulomb term, although small, makes Q increase at large A. We find that Q ≥ 0 for A & 150, and it is\nQ ≈ 6MeV for A = 200. Although Q > 0, we find experimentally that α decay only arise for A ≥ 200.\nFurther, take for example Francium-200 (200 Fr113). If we calculate Qα from the experimentally found mass differences\nwe obtain Qα ≈ 7.6MeV (the product is 196At). We can do the same calculation for the hypothetical decay into a\n12C and remaining fragment (188 Tl 107 ):\nZ XN ) - m(A-12\n′\nQ12C = c 2[m(A\nXN-6) - m(12C)] ≈ 28MeV\nZ-6\nThus this second reaction seems to be more energetic, hence more favorable than the alpha-decay, yet it does not\noccur (some decays involving C-12 have been observed, but their branching ratios are much smaller).\nThus, looking only at the energetic of the decay does not explain some questions that surround the alpha decay:\n- Why there's no 12C-decay? (or to some of this tightly bound nuclides, e.g O-16 etc.)\n- Why there's no spontaneous fission into equal daughters?\n- Why there's alpha decay only for A ≥ 200?\n√1\n- What is the explanation of Geiger-Nuttall rule? log t1/2 ∝\nQα\n1.3.2 Beta decay\nThe beta decay is a radioactive decay in which a proton in a nucleus is converted into a neutron (or vice-versa).\nThus A is constant, but Z and N change by 1. In the process the nucleus emits a beta particle (either an electron\nor a positron) and quasi-massless particle, the neutrino.\nCourtesy of Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility - Office\nof Science Education. Used with permission.\nFig. 6: Beta decay schematics\nThere are 3 types of beta decay:\nA\nA\n′\n-\nZ XN → Z+1XN-1 + e + ν\nThis is the β- decay (or negative beta decay). The underlying reaction is:\n-\nn → p + e + ν\nthat corresponds to the conversion of a proton into a neutron with the emission of an electron and an anti-neutrino.\nThere are two other types of reactions, the β+ reaction,\nA\nA\n′\n+\n+\n→\ne + ν\n⇐⇒\np → n + e + ν\nZ XN\nZ-1XN+1 +\nwhich sees the emission of a positron (the electron anti-particle) and a neutrino; and the electron capture:\nA\n-\nA\n′\n-\nZ XN + e\n→\n⇐⇒\np + e\n→ n + ν\nZ-1XN+1 + ν\na process that competes with, or substitutes, the positron emission.\n\nRecall the mass of nuclide as given by the semi-empirical mass formula. If we keep A fixed, the SEMF gives the\nbinding energy as a function of Z. The only term that depends explicitly on Z is the Coulomb term. By inspection\nwe see that B ∝ Z2. Then from the SEMF we have that the masses of possible nuclides with the same mass number\nlie on a parabola. Nuclides lower in the parabola have smaller M and are thus more stable. In order to reach that\nminimum, unstable nuclides undergo a decay process to transform excess protons in neutrons (and vice-versa).\n49In\n50Sn\n51Sb\n52Te\n53I\n55Cs\n54Xe\n56Ba\nA=125\n49In\n50Sn\n51Sb\n52Te\n53I\n55Cs\n54Xe\n56Ba\nA=128\n57La\nFig. 7: Nuclear Mass Chain for A=125, (left) and A=128 (right)\nThe beta decay is the radioactive decay process that can convert protons into neutrons (and vice-versa). We will\nstudy more in depth this mechanism, but here we want simply to point out how this process can be energetically\nfavorable, and thus we can predict which transitions are likely to occur, based only on the SEMF.\nFor example, for A = 125 if Z < 52 we have a favorable n → p conversion (beta decay) while for Z > 52 we have\np → n (or positron beta decay), so that the stable nuclide is Z = 52 (tellurium).\nA. Conservation laws\nAs the neutrino is hard to detect, initially the beta decay seemed to violate energy conservation. Introducing an\nextra particle in the process allows one to respect conservation of energy.\nThe Q value of a beta decay is given by the usual formula:\n′ ) - me\nQβ- = [mN (AX) - mN (A\n]c .\nZ+1X\nUsing the atomic masses and neglecting the electron's binding energies as usual we have\nQβ- = {[mA(AX) - Zme] - [mA(A\n′ ) - (Z + 1)me] - me}c = [mA(AX) - mA(A\n′ )]c .\nZ+1X\nZ+1X\nThe kinetic energy (equal to the Q) is shared by the neutrino\nand the electron (we neglect any recoil of the massive nucleus).\nThen, the emerging electron (remember, the only particle that\nwe can really observe) does not have a fixed energy, as it\nwas for example for the gamma photon. But it will exhibit\na spectrum of energy (or the number of electron at a given\nenergy) as well as a distribution of momenta. We will see how\nwe can reproduce these plots by analyzing the QM theory of\nbeta decay.\nExamples\nր\n-\n30Zn + e + ν,\nQβ\n0.57MeV\n\n=\n29Cu ց 64\n+\n28Ni + e + ν,\nQβ = 0.66MeV\nThe neutrino and beta particle (β±) share the energy.

For more information,\n\nare almost massless and interact very weakly with matter), the\nsee http://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\nelectrons/positrons are the particles detected in beta-decay\nFig. 8: Beta decay spectra: Distribution of momentum\nand they present a characteristic energy spectrum (see Fig.\n(top plots) and kinetic energy (bottom) for β- (left) and\n.\n8).\nβ+ (right) decay.\nThe difference between the spectrum of the β± particles is due to the Coulomb repulsion or attraction from the\nnucleus.\n\nNotice that the neutrinos also carry away angular momentum. They are spin-1/2 particles, with no charge (hence\nthe name) and very small mass. For many years it was actually believed to have zero mass. However it has been\nconfirmed that it does have a mass in 1998.\nOther conserved quantities are:\n- Momentum: The momentum is also shared between the electron and the neutrino. Thus the observed electron\nmomentum ranges from zero to a maximum possible momentum transfer.\n- Angular momentum (both the electron and the neutrino have spin 1/2)\n- Parity? It turns out that parity is not conserved in this decay. This hints to the fact that the interaction responsible\nviolates parity conservation (so it cannot be the same interactions we already studies, e.m. and strong interactions)\n- Charge (thus the creation of a proton is for example always accompanied by the creation of an electron)\n- Lepton number: we do not conserve the total number of particles (we create beta and neutrinos). However the\nnumber of massive, heavy particles (or baryons, composed of 3 quarks) is conserved. Also the lepton number is\nconserved. Leptons are fundamental particles (including the electron, muon and tau, as well as the three types of\nneutrinos associated with these 3). The lepton number is +1 for these particles and -1 for their antiparticles. Then\nan electron is always accompanied by the creation of an antineutrino, e.g., to conserve the lepton number (initially\nzero).\nAlthough the energy involved in the decay can predict whether a beta decay will occur (Q > 0), and which type of\nbeta decay does occur, the decay rate can be quite different even for similar Q-values. Consider for example 22Na\nand 36Cl. They both decay by β decay:\n11Na11 →22\n10 Ne12 + β+ + ν,\nQ = 0.22MeV,\nT 1\n2 = 2.6years\n17Cl19 →36\n18 Ar18 + β- + ν\nQ = 0.25MeV,\nT 1\n3 × 105 years\n=\nEven if they have very close Q-values, there is a five order magnitude in the lifetime. Thus we need to look closer to\nthe nuclear structure in order to understand these differences.\n1.3.3 Gamma decay\nIn the gamma decay the nuclide is unchanged, but it goes from an excited to a lower energy state. These states are\ncalled isomeric states. Usually the reaction is written as:\nA\nZ X ∗\n-→A\nZ XN + γ\nN\nwhere the star indicate an excited state. We will study that the gamma energy depends on the energy difference\nbetween these two states, but which decays can happen depend, once again, on the details of the nuclear structure\nand on quantum-mechanical selection rules associated with the nuclear angular momentum.\n1.3.4 Spontaneous fission\nSome nuclei can spontaneously undergo a fission, even outside the particular conditions found in a nuclear reactor.\nIn the process a heavy nuclide splits into two lighter nuclei, of roughly the same mass.\n1.3.5 Branching Ratios\nSome nuclei only decay via a single process, but sometimes they can undergo many different radioactive processes,\nthat compete one with the other. The relative intensities of the competing decays are called branching ratios.\nBranching ratios are expressed as percentage or sometimes as partial half-lives. For example, if a nucleus can decay\nby beta decay (and other modes) with a branching ration bβ , the partial half-life for the beta decay is λβ = bβ λ.\n\n[This page intentionally blank.]\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

It is thus necessary to establish a set of rules\nto map physical concepts and objects into mathematical objects that we use to represent them. Sometimes this\nmapping is evident, as in classical mechanics, while for other theories, such as quantum mechanics, the mathematical\nobjects are not intuitive.\nIn the same way as classical mechanics is founded on Newton's laws or electrodynamics on the Maxwell-Boltzmann\nequations, quantum mechanics is also based on some fundamental laws, which are called the postulates or axioms of\nquantum mechanics.\nWe want in particular to develop a mathematical model for the dynamics of closed quantum systems 1: therefore we\nare interested in defining\nstates\n-\nobservables\n-\nmeasurements\n-\nevolution\nSome subtleties will arise since we are trying to define measurement in a closed system, when the measuring person\nis instead outside the system itself. A more complete picture, that can explain some of the confusion arising from\nthe measurement process, is possible, but we will not study it in this course.\nWe are interested in giving a description of physical phenomena and in particular in how they emerge during an\nexperiment.\nExperiments - A physical experiment can be divided into two steps: preparation and measurement.\nIn classical mechanics (CM):\n- the first step determines the possible outcomes of the experiment,\n- while the measurement retrieves the value of the outcome.\nIn quantum mechanics (QM) the situation is slightly different:\n- the first step (preparation) determines the probabilities of the various possible outcomes,\n- the second step (measurement) retrieve the value of a particular outcome, in a statistic manner.\nThis separation of the experiment in two steps is reflected into the two types of operators that we find in QM.\n- The first step corresponds to the concept of a state of the system,\n1 We define a closed system any system that is isolated, thus not exchanging any input or output and not interacting with any\nother system. An open system instead interacts e.g., with an external environment.\n\n- while the second step corresponds to observables.\nIn CM the state of a system is described by a set of properties. For example, if we consider a ball, we can define\nits state by giving its position, momentum, energy, angular momentum (if for example the ball is spinning), its\ntemperature etc. We can then perform a measurement on this ball, for example measuring its position. This will give\nus one value for one possible observable (the position).\nWe can express this process in mathematical terms. The state of the system is defined by a set of values: {rr, r\nL, T, . . . }.\np, E, r\nAll of these values (and there might be of course more that I haven't written down) are needed to fully describe the\nstate of the ball. Performing a measurement of the position, will retrieve the values {rx, ry, rz } = rr (the same values\nthat describe the state).\nIf we now consider a nucleus, we can as well give a description of its state. In quantum mechanics, a complete descrip\ntion of the state of a quantum object (or system) is given mathematically by the state vector |ψ) (or wavefunction\nψ(rr)). The situation is however different than in classical mechanics.\nThe state vector is no longer a collection of values for different properties of the system. The state gives instead a\ncomplete description of the set of probabilities for all the physical properties (or observables). All the information is\ncontained in the state, irrespectively on how I got the state, of its previous history.\nOn the other hand, the observables are all the physical properties that in principle can be measured, in the same\nway as it was in classical mechanics. Since however the state only gives probabilities for all observables, the result of\nmeasurement will be a statistical variable.\nAll of these considerations are made more formal in the axioms of quantum mechanics that also indicate the math\nematical formalism to be used.\n1. The properties of a quantum system are completely defined by specification of its state vector |ψ). The state\nvector is an element of a complex Hilbert space H called the space of states.\n2. With every physical property A (energy, position, momentum, angular momentum, ...) there exists an associated\nlinear, Hermitian operator A (usually called observable), which acts in the space of states H. The eigenvalues of\nthe operator are the possible values of the physical properties.\n3.a If |ψ) is the vector representing the state of a system and if |φ) represents another physical state, there exists a\nprobability p(|ψ), |φ)) of finding |ψ) in state |φ), which is given by the squared modulus of the inner product on\nH: p(|ψ), |φ)) = |(ψ|φ)|2 (Born Rule).\n3.b If A is an observable with eigenvalues an and eigenvectors |n) [such that the eigenvalue equation is A |n) = an |n)],\ngiven a system in the state |ψ), the probability of obtaining an as the outcome of the measurement of A is\np(an) = |(n|ψ)|2. After the measurement the system is left in the state projected on the subspace of the eigenvalue\nan (Wave function collapse).\n4. The evolution of a closed system is unitary (reversible). The evolution is given by the time-dependent Schr odinger\nequation\n∂|ψ)\nii\n= H|ψ)\n∂t\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian of the system (the energy operator) and i is the reduced Planck constant h/2π (with\nh the Planck constant, allowing conversion from energy to frequency units).\n2.2 States, observables and eigenvalues\nD: From the first postulate we see that the state of a quantum system is given by the state vector |ψ(t)) (or the\nwavefunction ψ(rx, t)). The state vector contains all possible information about the system. The state vector is a\nvector in the Hilbert space. A Hilbert space H is a complex vector space that possess an inner product.\nAn example of Hilbert space is the usual Euclidean space of geometric vectors. This is a particularly simple case\nsince the space in this case is real. In general as we will see, Hilbert space vectors can be complex (that is, some of\ntheir components can be complex numbers). In the 3D Euclidean space we can define vectors, with a representation\nsuch as rv = {vx, vy , vz } or :\n\nvx\nrv = vy\nvz\nThis representation corresponds to choose a particular basis for the vector (in this case, the usual {x, y, z} coordi\nnates). We can also define the inner product between two vectors, rv and ru (which is just the usual scalar product):\n\nux\nrv · ru = [vx vy vz ] · uy = vxux + vy ux + vz uz\nuz\n\nT\nNotice that we have taken the transpose of the vector rv, rv\nin order to calculate the inner product. In general, in a\nHilbert space, we can define the dual of any vector. The Dirac notation makes this more clear.\nThe notation |ψ) is called the Dirac notation and the symbol |·) is called ket. This is useful in calculating inner\nproducts of state vectors using the bra (·| (which is the dual of the ket), for example (φ|. An inner product is then\nwritten as (φ|ψ) (this is a bracket, hence the names).\nWe will often describe states by their wavefunction instead of state vector. The wavefunction is just a particular way\nof writing down the state vector, where we express the state vector in a basis linked to the position of a particle\nitself (this is called the position representation). This particular case is however the one we are mostly interested in\nthis course. Mathematically, the wavefunction is a complex function of space and time. In the position representation\n(that is, the position basis) the state is expressed by the wavefunction via the inner product ψ(x) = (x|ψ).\nThe properties of Hilbert spaces, kets and bras and of the wavefunction can be expressed in a more rigorous mathe\nmatical way. In this course as said we are mostly interested in systems that are nicely described by the wavefunction.\nThus we will just use this mathematical tool, without delving into the mathematical details. We will see some more\nproperties of the wavefunction once we have defined observables and measurement.\nD: All physical observables (defined by the prescription of experiment or measurement ) are represented by a linear\noperator that operates in the Hilbert space H (a linear, complex, inner product vector space).\nIn mathematics, an operator is a type of function that acts on functions to produce other functions. Formally, an\noperator is a mapping between two function spaces2 A :\ng(I) → f(I) that assigns to each function g ∈ g(I) a\nfunction f = A(g) ∈ f(I).\nExamples of observables are what we already mentioned, e.g. position, momentum, energy, angular momentum.\nThese operators are associated to classical variables. To distinguish them from their classical variable counterpart,\nwe will thus put a hat on the operator name. For example, the position operators will be ˆx, y, z. The momentum\nˆ\nˆ\noperators ˆpx, pˆy, pˆz and the angular momentum operators Lˆx, Lˆy, Lˆz . The energy operator is called Hamiltonian\n(this is also true in classical mechanics) and is usually denoted by the symbol H.\nThere are also some operators that do not have a classical counterpart (remember that quantum-mechanics is more\ngeneral than classical mechanics). This is the case of the spin operator, an observable that is associated to each\nparticle (electron, nucleon, atom etc.). For example, the spin of an electron is usually denoted by S; this is also a\nvector variable (i.e. we can define Sx, Sy, Sz ). I am omitting here the hat since there is no classical variable we can\nconfuse the spin with. While the position, momentum etc. observable are continuous operator, the spin is a discrete\noperator.\nThe second postulate states that the possible values of the physical properties are given by the eigenvalues of the\noperators.\nD: Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an operator are defined as the solutions of the eigenvalue problem:\nA[un(rx)] = anun(rx)\nwhere n = 1, 2, . . . indexes the possible solutions. The an are the eigenvalues of A (they are scalars) and un(rx) are\nthe eigenfunctions.\nThe eigenvalue problem consists in finding the functions such that when the operator A is applied to them, the\nresult is the function itself multiplied by a scalar. (Notice that we indicate the action of an operator on a function\nby A[f(·)]).\nYou should have seen the eigenvalue problem in linear algebra, where you studied eigenvectors and eigenvalues of\nmatrices. Consider for example the spin operator for the electron S. The spin operator can be represented by the\nfollowing matrices (this is called a matrix representation of the operator; it's not unique and depends on the basis\nchosen):\n\n-i\nSx =\n,\nSy =\n,\nSz =\ni\n-1\nWe can calculate what are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this operators with some simple algebra. In class we\nconsidered the eigenvalue equations for Sx and Sz. The eigenvalue problem can be solved by setting the determinant\n2 for both operators. The eigenvectors are\nof the matrix Sα - s1 equal to zero. We find that the eigenvalues are ±\ndifferent:\n\nz\nz\nv =\n,\nv =\n\nx\nx\n√\n√\nv =\n,\nv2 =\n-1\nA function space f (I) is a collection of functions satisfying certain properties.\n\nWe proved also that v1 · v2 = 0 (that is, the eigenvectors are orthogonal) and that they form a complete basis (we can\nwrite any other vector, describing the state of the electron spin, as a linear combination of either the eigenvectors of\nSz or of Sx).\nThe eigenvalue problem can be solved in a similar way for continuous operators. Consider for example the differential\nd [·]\noperator,\n. The eigenvalue equation for this operator reads:\nd x\nd f(x) = af(x)\nd x\nwhere a is the eigenvalue and f(x) is the eigenfunction.\n? Question: what is f(x)? What are all the possible eigenvalues (and their corresponding eigenfunctions)?\nd [·]\nExamples - The eigenvalue equation for the operator is x\nis:\nd x\nd f(x)\nx\n= af(x)\nd x\nn\nwhich is solved by f(x) = x , a = n.\n-x\nThe \"standard\" Gaussian function √1 e\n2/2 is the eigenfunction of the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform is\n2π\nan operation that transforms one complex-valued function of a real variable into another one (thus it is an operator):\nJ inf\n-ikxdx\nFx : f(x) → f (k),\nwith\nf (k) = Fx[f(x)](k) = √ 1\nf(x)e\n2π\n-inf\nNotice that sometimes different normalizations are used. With this definition, we also find that the inverse Fourier\ntransform is given by:\nJ inf\nikxdk\nF-1 : f (k) → f(x),\nf(x) = √ 1\nf (k)e\nk\n2π\n-inf\nLet's now turn to quantum mechanical operators.\nD: Position operator - The position operator for a single particle rxˆ is simply given by the scalar rx. This means that\nthe operator rxˆ acting on the wavefunction ψ(rx) simply multiplies the wavefunction by rx. We can write\nˆrx[ψ(rx)] = rx ψ(rx).\nWe can now consider the eigenvalue problem for the position operator. For example, for the x-component of rx this\nis written as:\nxˆ[un(x)] = xnun(x)\n→ x un(x) = xnun(x)\nwhere we used the definition of the position operator. Here xn is the eigenvalue and un(x) the eigenfunction. The\nsolution to this equation is not a proper function, but a distribution (a generalized function): the Dirac delta function:\nun(x) = δ(x - xn)\nD: Dirac Delta function\nδ(x - x0) is equal to zero everywhere except at x0 where it is infinite. The Dirac Delta\nfunction also has the property that\nJ inf δ(x)dx = 1 and of course xδ(x - x0) = x0δ(x - x0) (which corresponds to\n-inf\nthe eigenvalue problem above). We also have:\nJ\ndxδ(x - x0)f(x) = f(x0)\nThat is, the integral of any function multiplied by the delta function gives back the function itself evaluated at the\npoint x0. [See any textbook (and recitations) for other properties.]\nHow many solutions are there to the eigenvalue problem defined above for the position operator? One per each\npossible position, that is an infinite number of solutions. Conversely, all possible positions are allowed values for the\nmeasurement of the position (a continuum of solutions in this case).\nD: Momentum operator - The momentum operator is defined (in analogy with classical mechanics) as the generator\nof translations. This means that the momentum modifies the position of a particle from rx to rx + drx. It is possible to\nshow that this definition gives the following form of the position operator (in the position representation, or position\nbasis)\nˆpx = -ii ∂\n∂x , ˆpy = -ii ∂\n∂y , ˆpz = -ii ∂\n∂z\n\nx\nx0\nf(x)\nf(x)\n1/ε\nδ(x-x0)\nδ(x-x0)\nε - 0\nx0-ε/2\nx0+ε/2\nx\nx0\nFig. 9: Schematics of Dirac's delta function. Left: the rectangular function of base o and height o becomes the delta-function\n(right) in the limit of o → 0.\nor in vector notation pˆ = -ii∇. Here i is the reduced Planck constant h/2π (with h the Planck constant) with value\ni = 1.054 × 10-34J s.\nPlanck's constant is introduced in order to make the values of quantum observables consistent with the corresponding\nclassical values.\nWe now study the momentum operator eigenvalue problem in 1D. The problem's statement is\n∂un(x)\npˆx[un(x)] = pnun(x)\n→\n-ii\n= pnun(x)\n∂x\nThis is a differential equation that we can solve quite easily. We set k = p/i and call k the wavenumber (for reasons\nclear in a moment). The differential equation is then\n∂un(x) = iknun(x)\n∂x\nwhich has as solution the complex function:\nx\nun(x) = Aeiknx = Aei p\n~\nn\nThe momentum eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are thus un = Aeiknx and kn.\nNow remember the meaning of the eigenvalues. By the second postulate, the eigenvalues of an operator are the\npossible values that one can obtain in a measurement.\nObs. 1 There are no restrictions on the possible values obtained from a momentum measurements. All values p = ik\nare possible.\nObs. 2 The eigenfunction un(x) corresponds to a wave traveling to the right with momentum pn = ikn. This was\nalso expressed by De Broglie when he postulated the existence of matter waves.\nLouis de Broglie (1892-1987) was a French physicist. In his Ph.D thesis he postulated a relationship between the\nmomentum of a particle and the wavelength of the wave associated with the particle (1922). In de Broglie's equation\na particle wavelength is the Planck's constant divided by the particle momentum. We can see this behavior in the\nelectron interferometer video3. For classical objects the momentum is very large (since the mass is large), then the\nwavelength is very small and the object loose its wave behavior. De Broglie equation was experimentally confirmed\nin 1927 when physicists Lester Germer and Clinton Davisson fired electrons at a crystalline nickel target and the\nresulting diffraction pattern was found to match the predicted values.\n2.2.1 Properties of eigenfunctions\nFrom these examples we can notice two properties of eigenfunctions which are valid for any operator:\n3 A. Tonomura, J. Endo, T. Matsuda, T. Kawasaki and H. Ezawa, Am. J. of Phys. 57, 117 (1989)\n\n1. The eigenfunctions of an operator are orthogonal functions. We will as well assume that they are normalized.\nJ\nConsider two eigenfunctions un, um of an operator A and the inner product defined by (f|g) =\nd3x f ∗(x)g(x).\nThen we have\nJ\n∗\nd3 x u m(x)un(x) = δnm\n2. The set of eigenfunctions forms a complete basis.\nThis means that any other function can be written in terms of the set of eigenfunctions {un(x)} of an operator A:\nJ\n\nd3\n∗\nf(x) =\ncnun(x),\nwith\ncn =\nx u (x)f(x)\nn\nn\n[Note that the last equality is valid iif the eigenfunctions are normalized, which is exactly the reason for normalizing\nthem].\nIf the eigenvalues are a continuous parameter, we have a continuum of eigenfunctions, and we will have to replace\nthe sum over n with an integral.\nConsider the two examples we saw. From the property of the Dirac Delta function we know that we can write any\nfunction as:\nJ\n′\nf(x) =\ndx ′ δ(x - x)f(x ′ )\nWe can interpret this equation as to say that any function can be written in terms of the position eigenfunction\nδ(x ′ -x) (notice that we are in the continuous case mentioned before, since the x-eigenvalue is a continuous function).\nIn this case the coefficient cn becomes also a continuous function\nJ\ncn → c(xn) =\ndx δ(x - xn)f(x) = f(xn).\nThis is not surprising as we are already expressing everything in the position basis.\nIf we want instead to express the function f(x) using the basis given by the momentum operator eigenfunctions we\nhave: (consider 1D case)\nJ\nJ\nf(x) =\ndk uk(x)c(k) =\ndk eikx c(k)\nwhere again we need an integral since there is a continuum of possible eigenvalues. The coefficient c(k) can be\ncalculated from\nJ\nJ\nc(k) =\ndx u k\n∗ (x)f(x) =\ndx e-ikxf(x)\nWe then have that c(k) is just the Fourier transform of the function f(x) (up to a multiplier).\nThe Fourier transform is an operation that transforms one complex-valued function of a real variable into another:\nJ inf\n-ikxdx\nFx : f(x) → f (k),\nwith\nf (k) = Fx[f(x)](k) = √ 1\nf(x)e\n2π\n-inf\nNotice that sometimes different normalizations are used. With this definition, we also find that the inverse Fourier\ntransform is given by:\nJ inf\nikxdk\nF-1 : f (k) → f(x),\nf(x) = √ 1\nf (k)e\nk\n2π\n-inf\n2.2.2 Review of linear Algebra\nThis is a very concise review of concepts in linear algebra, reintroducing some of the ideas we saw in the previous\nparagraphs in a slightly more formal way.\nA. Vectors and vector spaces\nQuantum mechanics is a linear theory, thus it is well described by vectors and vector spaces. Vectors are mathematical\nobjects (distinct from scalars) that can be added one to another and multiplied by a scalar. In QM we denote vectors\nby the Dirac notation: |ψ), |φ), . . . Then, these have the properties:\n- If |ψ1) and |ψ2) are vectors, then |ψ3) = |ψ1) + |ψ2) is also a vector.\n\n- Given a scalar s, |ψ4) = s |ψ1) is also a vector.\nA vector space is a collection of vectors. For example, for vectors of finite dimensions, we can define a vector space\nof dimensions N over the complex numbers as the collection of all complex-valued N-dimensional vectors.\nExample 1 - A familiar example of vectors and vector space are the Euclidean vectors and the real 3D space.\nExample 2 - Another example of a vector space is the space of polynomials of order n. Its elements, the polynomials\nPn = a0+a1x+a2x +· · ·+anxn can be proved to be vectors since they can be summed to obtain another polynomial\nand multiplied by a scalar. The dimension of this vector space is n + 1.\nExample 3 - In general, functions can be considered vectors of a vector space with infinite dimension (of course, if\nwe restrict the set of functions that belong to a given space, we must ensure that this is still a well-defined vector\nspace. For example, the collection of all function f(x) bounded by 3 [f(x) < 3, ∀x] is not a well defined vector-space,\nsince sf(x) (with s a scalar > 1) is not a vector in the space.\nB. Inner product\nWe denote by (ψ|φ) the scalar product between the two vectors |ψ) and |φ). The inner product or scalar product is\na mapping from two vectors to a complex scalar, with the following properties:\n- It is linear in the second argument: (ψ|a1φ1 + a2φ2) = a1(ψ|φ1) + a2(ψ|φ2).\n- It has the property of complex conjugation: (ψ|φ) = (φ|ψ)∗ .\n- It is positive-definite: (ψ|ψ) = 0 ⇔|ψ) = 0.\nExample 1 - For Euclidean vectors the inner product is the usual scalar product rv1 · rv2 = |rv1||rv2| cos θ.\nExample 2 - For functions, the inner product is defined as:\nJ inf\n(f|g) =\nf(x) ∗ g(x)dx\n-inf\nC. Linearly independent vectors (and functions)\nWe can define linear combinations of vectors as |ψ) = a1 |φ1) + a2 |φ2) + . . . . If a vector cannot be expressed as a\nlinear superposition of a set of vectors, than it is said to be linearly independent from these vectors. In mathematical\nterms, if\n\n|ξ) 6\nai |φi) ,\n=\n∀ai\ni\nthen |ξ) is linearly independent of the vectors {|φi)}.\nD. Basis\nA basis is a linearly independent set of vectors that spans the space. The number of vectors in the basis is the vector\nspace dimension. Any other vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors. The basis is not\nunique, and we will usually choose an orthonormal basis.\nExamples - For the Polynomial vector space, a basis are the monomials {xk}, k = 0, . . . , n. For Euclidean vectors\nthe vectors along the 3 coordinate axes form a basis.\nWe have seen in class that eigenvectors of operators form a basis.\nE. Unitary and Hermitian operators\nAn important class of operators are self adjoint or Hermitian operators, as observables are described by them. We\nneed first to define the adjoint of an operator A. This is denoted A+ and it is defined by the relation:\n\n(A+ψ) φ) = (φ|(Aψ))\n∀{|ψ) , |φ)}.\nThis condition can also be written (by using the second property of the inner product) as:\n(ψ|A+|φ) = (φ|A|ψ) ∗\nIf the operator is represented by a matrix, the adjoint of an operator is the conjugate transpose of that operator:\n+\n∗\nA\n= (k| A+ |j) = (j| A |k) = A∗\nk,j\nj,k.\n\nD: Self-adjoint . A self adjoint operator is an operator such that A+ = A, or more precisely\n(ψ|A|φ) = (φ|A|ψ) ∗\nA∗\nFor matrix operators, Aki =\nik.\nAn important properties of Hermitian operators is that their eigenvalues are always real (even if the operators are\ndefined on the complex numbers). Then, all the observables must be represented by hermitian operators, since we\nwant their eigenvalues to be real, as the eigenvalues are nothing else than possible outcomes of experiments (and we\nwouldn't want the position of a particle, for example, to be a complex number).\nThen, for example, the Hamiltonian of any system is an hermitian operator. For a particle in a potential, it's easy\nto check that the operator is real, thus it is also hermitian.\nD: Unitary operators U are such that their inverse is equal to their adjoint: U -1 = U +, or\nUU + = U +U = 1 .\nWe will see that the evolution of a system is given by a unitary operator, which implies that the evolution is\ntime-reversible.\n2.3 Measurement and probability\nFrom the second postulate we have seen that the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the\noperator corresponding to the measured observable. The question of which one of the eigenvalue we will obtain is\nstill open. This question is resolved by the third postulate, which gives a recipe on how to predict which outcome\nwill be observed. However, this mathematical recipe does not tell us (in general) with absolute certainty which one\nof the eigenvalue will be the outcome. It only provides us with the probability of obtaining each eigenvalue.\nIn postulate 3.b we consider an observable A and a system in the state |ψ). The eigenvalue equation for the operator\nA (corresponding to A) can be expressed as\nA |n) = an |n)\nwhere an are the eigenvalues and |n) the eigenvectors . The postulate states that the probability of obtaining an as\nthe outcome of the measurement of A is p(an) = |(n|ψ)|2 .\nWe want to re-express the postulate in terms of the wavefunction ψ(rx). To do so, we need to define the inner product\nin the Hilbert space of the wavefunctions. Given two wave functions ψ(rx) and φ(rx), the inner product (φ|ψ) is given\nby:\nJ\n(φ|ψ) =\nd3 rx φ(x) ∗ ψ(x)\n(where ∗ indicates the complex conjugate).\nWe first rewrite the eigenvalue problem for the operator A in terms of the eigenfunctions un(rx) and the associated\neigenvalues an:\nA[un(rx)] = anun(rx)\nThen, we have seen that any function can be expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions un(rx). We can as well express\nthe wavefunction in terms of these eigenfunctions:\nJ\n∗\nd3\nψ(rx) =\n(rx), with\n=\nrx u (rx)ψ(rx)\ncnun\ncn\nn\nn\nFinally, according to postulate 3.b the probability of obtaining the outcome an if the system is in the state ψ(rx) is\ngiven by the inner product :\nJ\n∗\np(an) =\nd3 rx u (rx)ψ(rx)\n= |cn|2\nn\nwhere the last equality follows from the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions\nJ\nd3rx u ∗ (rx)um(rx) = 0, for m\nn.\nn\nSince |cn|2 = p(an) is a probability, the coefficients cn of the wavefunction expansion are called probability amplitudes.\nWe now confirm that the wavefunction contain all information about the state of the system, since given the wave-\nfunction we can calculate all the probabilities of each outcome for each possible observable with the following proce\ndure:\n1) Find the eigenfunctions of the observable's operator. E.g., given an operator O, we will calculate its eigenfunctions\nwn(x), such that O[wn(x)] = onwn(x).\nX\n\n=\n\nP\n2) Find the probability amplitude of the wavefunction with respect to the eigenfunction of the desired eigenvalue\noutcome.\nE.g., if the outcome is om, such that O[wm(x)] = omwm(x) we will calculate cm =\nJ\nrx w ∗ (rx)ψ(rx).\nd3\nm\n3) The probability of obtaining the given eigenvalue in the measurement is the probability amplitude modulus\n|2\nsquare. E.g. p(om) = |cm .\n2.3.1 Wavefunction collapse\nThe third postulate states also that after the measurement the system is left in the eigenstate corresponding to\nthe eigenvalue found (more generally, if more than one eigenstate is associated to the same eigenvalue, the state is\nprojected on the subspace of the eigenvalue an, that is, the subspace spanned by all the eigenstates associated with\nan).\nThis is the wavefunction collapse, a concept that is usually quite puzzling in quantum mechanics. We can make this\nstatement at least a bit less puzzling by taking into account the following two considerations.\nThe wavefunction collapse is puzzling because it predicts an instantaneous evolution of the system from its pre\nmeasurement state ψ(x) to its post-measurement state un(x) (when we measure an). This type of evolution is very\ndifferent than the usual evolution predicted by the fourth postulate (that we will see in a later lecture). However,\nthis weird behavior arises from considering the measurement apparatus (and hence the measurement) as a classical\nsystem, outside the realm of quantum mechanics. Although this view gives most of the time a correct answer - and\nthus we will use it in this class - it is a quite imprecise description. More rigorous descriptions of the measurement\nprocess, invoking for example decoherence4 , can give a better picture of what actually happens (e.g. the wave-function\ncollapse can take a finite time and be measured experimentally in some cases).\nMore pragmatically, the wavefunction collapse is needed in order to make experiment consistent. What the collapse\nentails is that if I make a measurement and I obtain as an outcome the eigenvalue an, I can check that result again,\nby repeating the measurement just after the first one (with no time for any change in the system between the two\nmeasurement). If I could not make this second check, I could never be able to be confident that I got the correct\nanswer the first time (e.g. my detector could be wrong) and so I could never gain any knowledge at all on my system.\nObs.: I want to clarify the meaning of \"subspace of the eigenvalue an\". If there is a set of eigenstates associated with\nthe eigenvalue an, |nj ), then the state |ψ) is projected onto a superposition of these eigenstates |ψ) →|n) =\nj cj |nj ).\n2.3.2 Position measurement\nWe have already calculated the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the position operator. The eigenfunctions were\nun(x) = δ(x - xn) with eigenvalues xn. We also calculated the expansion of a function in terms of the position\neigenfunctions. Repeating the calculation for the wavefunction we find:\nJ\nc(xn) =\ndx δ(x - xn)ψ(x) = ψ(xn),\nfrom which we obtain that the probability of finding a particle in the position xn is given by:\np(xn) = |ψ(xn)|2\nMore generally, since x is continuous, we can drop the subscript n, as any value of x is an eigenvalue. Then, generalizing\nto the 3D case, we can say that the probability of finding a particle described by the wavefunction ψ(rx) at the position\nrx is given by the modulus square of the wavefunction itself:\np(rx) = |ψ(rx)|2\nWe can also say that the wavefunction is the probability amplitude for the position measurement. More precisely,\nwe should say that the probability of finding a particle between x and x + dx is p(x)dx = |ψ(x)|2dx while |ψ(x)|2 is\na probability density (per unit length). In 3D, |ψ(rx)|2 is the probability density per unit volume and the probability\nis given by |ψ(rx)|2d3x.\nDecoherence is the phenomenon by which an open quantum system, interacting with the environment, undergoes an irreversible\nevolution that often leaves it in a state best described by the rules of classical mechanics.\n\nGiven this interpretation of the wavefunction, it becomes natural to require that the wavefunction be normalized. We\nrequire that integrating the probability of a particular position over all possible position we obtain 1 (i.e. certainty,\nthe particle has to be somewhere!). Then\nJ\nJ\nd3\nd3\nrx p(rx) = 1\n→\nrx |ψ(rx)|2 = 1\nFrom being a very abstract notion, the wavefunction has thus assumed a very physical meaning. We can still say that\nthe wavefunction describes the state of a system and contains all the information about this system. In addition, and\nmore concretely, the absolute value of the wavefunction tells us where it is more probable to find the system.\n2.3.3 Momentum measurement\nWe calculated the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the momentum operator to be\np = ik\nand\nuk(x) = Υeikx\n(Notice that we could have labeled the wave-numbers as kn --and the momentum pn -- to have the eigenvalue\nequation: ˆpun = pnun, but we omitted the subscript n since momentum is a continuous variable; then we also simply\nlabel the eigenfunctions by k instead of n).\nJ\n∗\nJ\nAs usual, we would like the eigenfunctions to be normalized. However notice that\nu (x)uk(x)dx =\n|Υ |2dx = inf,\nk\n√1\n√1\nikx\nso we cannot fix Υ such that the result is normalized as usual. For convention we set Υ =\n: uk(x) =\ne\n2π\n2π\n(we are considering the 1D case). Now we can calculate the probability amplitude for the momentum measurement,\nby calculating the coefficients of the expansion of the wavefunction in terms of the momentum eigenfunctions basis.\nHere we rename the coefficients c(k) of the expansion φ(k). This is given by:\nJ\nJ\n-ikxψ(x)\nc(k) ≡ φ(k) =\nuk(x) ∗ ψ(x)\n→ φ(k) = √\ne\n2π\nNotice that this last equation is simply stating that the probability amplitude for the momentum measurement is\nthe Fourier transform of the wavefunction, φ(k) = F[ψ(x)]. Then\np(k → k + dk) = |φ(k)|2dk\nis the probability of finding that the particle has a momentum between ik and i(k + dk) when measuring the\nmomentum.\nA. Flux of particles\nThe choice of the coefficient Υ implies that:\nJ\n∗\nuk(x)uk′ (x)dx = δ(k - k ′ )\nwhich is not the usual normalization for the wavefunction.\nWhy is it not possible to normalize the momentum eigenstates?\nWe saw that for the wavefunction, the normalization was related to its interpretation as the probability amplitude\nfor the position. If a wavefunction is in a momentum eigenstate ψ(x) = uk(x), then we cannot really talk about a\nparticle, but rather the system is better described by a wave. In fact, the probability of finding the system at any\nposition x is constant and equal to Υ . Thus the coefficient Υ can be better linked to a flux of particles rather than a\nparticle density.\nWe can set v|ψ|2 = Γ where v =\np\n'k\n=\nis the velocity and Γ correspond to a flux of particle, as described by the\nm\nm\nq\nmΓ\nplane wave eikx. Then '\nm\nk |Υ |2 = Γ fixes the value of Υ to Υ =\n'k .\n2.3.4 Expectation values\nWe have just seen that the outcome of a measurement is a random quantity (although it is of course limited to a\ngiven set of values -the eigenvalues- from which we can choose from). In order to know more about the state of a\nsystem we need then to repeat the measurement several times, in order to build a statistics of the observable.\n\nFor example, we could be interested in knowing what is the average of the measurements of a particular observable.\nThis quantity is usually called in QM the expectation value of an observable.\nHow do we usually calculate the average of a given quantity? Consider for example the average number obtained by\nthrowing a dice. In an experiment, I would have to repeatedly throw the dice, record the number that comes out\n(say ni) and then calculate the sum: (n) = 1 PN\ni=1 ni. Equivalently, I could count the number of times tn that each\nN\nP6\nnumber n appears and calculate the average number from the frequencies νn = tn/N: (n) =\nn=1 νnn. In the limit\nof N →inf, the frequencies νn approach the probabilities νn → pn. Then for the dice we have pn = 1/6 (∀n) and the\naverage is just calculates from the sum 1(1 + 2 + . . . 6) = 3.5.\nThe procedure for calculating the average (or expectation value) of a quantity is very general. We have for discrete\nand continuous probability distribution functions respectively\nJ\n(x) =\npixi\n(x) =\ndxp(x)x\ni\nIn QM we just need to replace the probability p by its value as given by the third postulate. For example, the\nexpectation value of the position can be expressed in terms of the probability density function given by the modulus\nsquare of the wavefunction:\n(x) =\nJ inf\n-inf\nx|ψ(x, t)|2dx\nHow can we in practice obtain this expectation value? (that is, by performing real experiments). If we make a first\nmeasurement on a single particle and then repeat the measurement over and over again this is not what we measure.\nIn fact, in that case we know (from the postulates) that after the first measurement we expect always to get the\nsame result. In fact, these repeated successive measurement are only a way to check that yes, we got the first answer\ncorrect. (otherwise we could never be certain of anything, since we would not even know that our experimental\napparatus works).\nInstead what we can do is adopt one of two strategies. Either we can repeat the same experiment (not measurement)\nmany times on the same system. This implies first preparing the system in a given state with a reproducible procedure\nand then performing a measurement. The second option is to make the experiment on a set (an ensemble ) of identical\nsystems. In order to obtain the exact expectation value we would need an infinite number (of repetitions or systems),\nhowever a large enough sample is usually practically enough.\nObs.: Notice that we can rewrite the expression above for the expectation value of the position as\nJ inf\nJ inf\n(x) =\nψ(x, t) ∗ x ψ(x, t)dx =\nψ(x, t) ∗ xˆ[ψ(x, t)]dx\n-inf\n-inf\nThis last form is a more general one that is valid for any operator.\nD: Expectation value The expectation value of an observable Oˆ is\nD\nˆO\nE\n= (ψ| ˆO|ψ) =\nJ inf\n-inf\nψ(x, t) ∗ ˆO[ψ(x, t)]dx\nwhere we first used the Dirac notation to express the expectation value, which is an even more general expression.\nExample - The expectation value for the momentum operator is given by:\nJ inf\nJ inf\n∂ψ(x, t)\nψ(x, t) ∗ pˆ[ψ(x, t)]dx =\nψ(x, t) ∗\n-ii\ndx\n-inf\n-inf\n∂x\nX\n\n2.4 Energy eigenvalue problem\nThe energy operator is called Hamiltonian. The first postulate stated that the time dependence of the wavefunction\nis dictated by the Schr odinger equation:\n∂ψ(rx, t)\nii\n= Hψ(rx, t)\n∂t\nIf we assume that ψ(rx, t) is the product of a time-dependent part T (t) and a time-independent one φ(rx), we can\nattempt to solve the equation by separation of variables. From ψ(rx, t) = T (t)φ(rx), we can rewrite the Schr odinger\nequation (using the fact that H does not change T (t)):\n∂T (t)φ(rx)\n∂T (t)\nii\n= H [T (t)φ(rx, t)]\n→\nφ(rx) · ii\n= T (t) · H [φ(rx, t)]\n∂t\n∂t\nand we rearrange terms based on their dependence on t or rx\n∂T (t)\nii\n=\nH [φ(rx, t)]\nT (t)\n∂t\nφ(rx)\nEach side has to be equal to a constant, in order for the equality to hold. Then the time-independent wavefunction\nobeys the time-independent Schr odinger equation:\nHφ(rx) = Eφ(rx)\nwhere E is identified as the energy of the system. If the wavefunction is given by just its time-independent part,\nψ(rx, t) = φ(rx), the state is stationary. Thus, the time-independent Schr odinger equation allows us to find stationary\nstates of the system, given a certain Hamiltonian.\nNotice that the time-independent Schr odinger equation is nothing else than the eigenvalue equation for the Hamil\ntonian operator. It is thus particularly interesting to study eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this operator (which,\nas said, correspond to the energies and stationary states of the system) 5 .\nIn general, the wavefunction describing the state of a quantum system is not\nThe energy of a particle has contributions from the kinetic energy as well as the potential energy:\n2) + V (x, y, z)\nE =\n(p + p + p\nx\ny\nz\n2m\nz\ny\nIn quantum mechanics we can find the equivalent operator by substituting the quantum operators for the position\nand momentum in the above expression:\n+ ˆ + ˆ\nH =\n) + V (ˆx, ˆ z)\ny, ˆ\nx\n(ˆp\np\np\n2m\nor more explicitly:\ni2\n∂2\n∂2\n∂2\nH = -\n+\n+\n+ V (x, y, z)\n2m\n∂x2\n∂y2\n∂z2\nand in a compact form\ni2\n∇2\nH = -\n+V (x, y, z)\n2m\n(Notice that V (x, y, z) is just a multiplicative operator, in the same way as the position is).\nI want to clarify the distinction between eigenfunctions and wavefunctions. In this class we are interested in both. The\neigenfunctions are related to a given operator, and they are the solutions to the eigenvalue equation for that operator. They\nare important since they form a basis and they allow us to calculate the probability of obtaining a given measurement\noutcome. The wavefunction describes the state of the quantum system. In general, it is not an eigenfunction. However, if we\nare considering a stationary state, the wavefunction that represents it must be an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian (energy)\noperator. Thus in that particular case only (which is a quite common case!) the wavefunction is also an eigenfunction.\n\n2.4.1 Free particle\nIn 1D, for a free particle there is no potential energy, but only kinetic energy that we can rewrite as:\ni2 ∂2\nH =\np = -\n2m\n2m ∂x2\nThe eigenvalue problem Hwn(x) = Enwn(x) is then the differential equation\ni2 ∂2 wn(x)\nHwn(x) = Enwn(x)\n→\n-\n= Enwn(x)\n2m\n∂x2\nwe rewrite it as:\n∂2 wn(x)\n2mEn\n∂2 wn(x)\n+\nwn = 0\n→\n+ k2 wn = 0\nn\n∂x2\ni2\n∂x2\nwhere we used the identity\ni2k2\nn = En\n2m\nbetween the kinetic energy eigenvalue En and the wavenumber kn ( and the momentum pn = ikn).\nFor a free particle there is no restriction on the possible energies, En can be any positive number. The solution to\nthe eigenvalue problem is then the eigenfunction:\niknx\n-iknx\nwn(x) = A sin(knx) + B cos(knx) = A ′ e\n+ B ′ e\nWe see that there are two independent functions for each eigenvalue En. Also there are two distinct momentum\neigenvalues ±kn for each energy eigenvalue, which correspond to two different directions of propagation of the wave\n±iknx\nfunction e\n.\n\n2.5 Operators, Commutators and Uncertainty Principle\n2.5.1 Commutator\nD: Commutator The Commutator of two operators A, B is the operator C = [A, B] such that C = AB - BA.\nExample 1 - If the operators A and B are scalar operators (such as the position operators) then AB = BA and the\ncommutator is always zero.\nExample 2 - If the operators A and B are matrices, then in general AB = BA. Consider for example:\nA = 1\n\n, B = 1\n\n-1\n\nThen\nAB = 1\n\n-1\n\n,\nBA = 1\n\n-1\n\n,\nThen [A, B] = 2AB.\nExample 3 - A is Turn to your right. B is Take 3 steps to your left.\n? Question: do these two operators commute?\nFig. 10: Two rotations A, B along the x-axis. Left: we apply AB (first the 3π/4 rotation), right we apply BA. Since the two\noperators commute, the result is the same.\nExample 4 - Let A and B be two rotations. First assume that A is a π/4 rotation around the x direction and B\na 3π/4 rotation in the same direction. Now assume that the vector to be rotated is initially around z. Then, if we\napply AB (that means, first a 3π/4 rotation around x and then a π/4 rotation), the vector ends up in the negative\nz direction. The same happen if we apply BA (first A and then B).\nFig. 11: Two rotations A, B along the x- and z-axis. Left: we apply AB (first the π/2 rotation along z), right: we apply BA.\nSince the two operators do not commute, the result is not the same.\nNow assume that A is a π/2 rotation around the x direction and B around the z direction. When we apply AB, the\nvector ends up (from the z direction) along the y-axis (since the first rotation does not do anything to it), if instead\nwe apply BA the vector is aligned along the x direction. In this case the two rotations along different axes do not\ncommute.\nThese examples show that commutators are not specific of quantum mechanics but can be found in everyday life.\nWe now want an example for QM operators.\n\nThe most famous commutation relationship is between the position and momentum operators. Consider first the 1D\ncase. We want to know what is [ˆx, pˆx] (I'll omit the subscript on the momentum). We said this is an operator, so in\norder to know what it is, we apply it to a function (a wavefunction). Let's call this operator Cxp, Cxp = [ˆx, pˆx].\nd\nd\n[ˆx, pˆ]ψ(x) = Cxp[ψ(x)] = xˆ [ˆp[ψ(x)]] - pˆ[ˆx[ψ(x)]] = -ii x\n-\nx\nψ(x)\ndx\ndx\nd ψ(x)\nd\nd ψ(x)\nd ψ(x)\nZZZ\nZZZ\n-ii x\n-\n(xψ(x))\n= -ii x\nx\n= iiψ(x)\n- ψ(x) -Z\nZ\ndx\ndx\ndx\ndx\nFrom [ˆx, pˆ]ψ(x) = iiψ(x) which is valid for all ψ(x) we can write\n[ˆx, pˆ] = ii\nConsidering now the 3D case, we write the position components as {rx, ryrz }. Then we have the commutator rela\ntionships:\n[ˆra, pˆb] = iiδa,b\nthat is, vector components in different directions commute (the commutator is zero).\nA. Properties of commutators\n- Any operator commutes with scalars [A, a] = 0\n- [A, BC] = [A, B]C + B[A, C] and [AB, C] = A[B, C] + [A, C]B\n- Any operator commutes with itself [A, A] = 0, with any power of itself [A, An] = 0 and with any function of itself\n[A, f(A)] = 0 (from previous property and with power expansion of any function).\nFrom these properties, we have that the Hamiltonian of the free particle commutes with the momentum: [p, H] = 0\nsince for the free particle H = p2/2m. Also, [x, p2] = [x, p]p + p[x, p] = 2iip.\nWe now prove an important theorem that will have consequences on how we can describe states of a systems, by\nmeasuring different observables, as well as how much information we can extract about the expectation values of\ndifferent observables.\n- Theorem: If A and B commute, then they have a set of non-trivial common eigenfunctions.\nProof: Let φa be an eigenfunction of A with eigenvalue a:\nAφa = aφa\nThen\nBAφa = aBφa\nBut since [A, B] = 0 we have BA = AB. Let's substitute in the LHS:\nA(Bφa) = a(Bφa)\nThis means that (Bφa) is also an eigenfunction of A with the same eigenvalue a. If φa is the only linearly independent\neigenfunction of A for the eigenvalue a, then Bφa is equal to φa at most up to a multiplicative constant: Bφa ∝ φa.\nThat is, we can write\nBφa = baφa\nBut this equation is nothing else than an eigenvalue equation for B. Then φa is also an eigenfunction of B with\neigenvalue ba. We thus proved that φa is a common eigenfunction for the two operators A and B.\nD\nExample - We have just seen that the momentum operator commutes with the Hamiltonian of a free particle. Then\nthe two operators should share common eigenfunctions.\nThis is indeed the case, as we can verify. Consider the eigenfunctions for the momentum operator:\ndψk\nAe-ikx\npˆ[ψk] = ikψk\n→\n-ii\n= ikψk\n→\nψk =\ndx\nWhat is the Hamiltonian applied to ψk?\nd2(Ae-ikx)\ni2\ni2k2\nAe-ikx\nH[ψk] = -\n=\n= Ekψk\n2m\ndx2\n2m\nthus we found that ψk is also a solution of the eigenvalue equation for the Hamiltonian, which is to say that it is also\nan eigenfunction for the Hamiltonian.\n\n2.5.2 Commuting observables\nA. Degeneracy\nIn the proof of the theorem about commuting observables and common eigenfunctions we took a special case, in which\nwe assume that the eigenvalue a was non-degenerate. That is, we stated that φa was the only linearly independent\neigenfunction of A for the eigenvalue a (functions such as 4φa, αφa don't count, since they are not linearly independent\nfrom φa).\nD: Degeneracy\nIn general, an eigenvalue is degenerate if there is more than one eigenfunction that has the same\neigenvalue. The degeneracy of an eigenvalue is the number of eigenfunctions that share that eigenvalue.\nFor example a is n-degenerate if there are n eigenfunction {φa\nj }, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, such that Aφa = aφa\nj .\nj\nWhat happens if we relax the assumption that the eigenvalue a is not degenerate in the theorem above? Consider\nfor example that there are two eigenfunctions associated with the same eigenvalue:\nAφa\naφa and\nAφa\naφa\n1 =\n2 =\nthen any linear combination φa = c1φ1\na + c2φ2\na is also an eigenfunction with the same eigenvalue (there's an infinity\nof such eigenfunctions). From the equality A(Bφa) = a(Bφa) we can still state that (Bφa) is an eigenfunction of A\nbut we don't know which one. Most generally, there exist c1 and c2 such that\nBφa\n1 = c 1φ1\na + c2φa\nbut in general Bφa∝φ1\na, or φa\n1 is not an eigenfunction of B too.\n1;\n2 k2\n'\nExample - Consider again the energy eigenfunctions of the free particle. To each energy E =\nare associated two\n2m\nlinearly-independent eigenfunctions (the eigenvalue is doubly degenerate). We can choose for example φE = eikx and\nφE = e-ikx. Notice that these are also eigenfunctions of the momentum operator (with eigenvalues ±k). If we had\nchosen instead as the eigenfunctions cos(kx) and sin(kx) these are not eigenfunctions of ˆp.\n- Theorem: In general, it is always possible to choose a set of (linearly independent) eigenfunctions of A for the\neigenvalue a such that they are also eigenfunctions of B.\nFor the momentum/Hamiltonian for example we have to choose the exponential functions instead of the trigonometric\nfunctions. Also, if the eigenvalue of A is degenerate, it is possible to label its corresponding eigenfunctions by the\neigenvalue of B, thus lifting the degeneracy. For example, there are two eigenfunctions associated with the energy E:\nikx\nφE = e±ikx. We can distinguish between them by labeling them with their momentum eigenvalue ±k: φE,+k = e\n-ikx\nand φE,-k = e\n.\nProof: Assume now we have an eigenvalue a with an n-fold degeneracy such that there exists n independent eigenfunctions φa\nk,\nφa\nLn\nckφa\nk = 1, . . . , n. Any linear combination of these functions is also an eigenfunction =\nk=1\nk. For any of these eigenfunctions\n(let's take the hth one) we can write:\nB[A[φa\n=\nh]] = aB[φa\nh]]\nA[B[φa\nh]\nso that φ a\nh = B[φa\nh] is an eigenfunction of A with eigenvalue a. Then this function can be written in terms of the {φk\na}:\nL\nB[φa = φ a\n\nh]\nh =\nch,kφk\na\nk\nThis notation makes it clear that c h,k is a tensor (an n × n matrix) operating a transformation from a set of eigenfunctions of A\n(chosen arbitrarily) to another set of eigenfunctions. We can write an eigenvalue equation also for this tensor,\nL\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\n\n= b v\n→\n\nh = b v\ncv\nch,kv\nh\nj\nwhere the eigenvectors v\nare vectors of length n.\nL\nj\nIf we now define the functions ψj\na =\nh vhφh\na, we have that ψj\na are of course eigenfunctions of A with eigenvalue a. Also\nn\nL\nL\nL\nB[ψa =\nvj B[φa =\nvj\n\nj ]\nh\nh]\nh\nch,kφk\na\nh\nh\nk=1\nL\nL\nL\nL\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nφa\nφa\nφa\nψa\n=\nk\nc h,kvh =\nkb vk = b\nvk\nk = b\nj\nk\nh\nk\nk\nWe have thus proved that ψj\na are eigenfunctions of B with eigenvalues bj. The ψj\na are simultaneous eigenfunctions of both A and\nB.\n\nConsider the set of functions {ψj\na}. From the point of view of A they are not distinguishable, they all have the same eigenvalue\nso they are degenerate. Taking into account a second operator B, we can lift their degeneracy by labeling them with the index j\ncorresponding to the eigenvalue of B (bj).\nExample - Assume that we choose φ1 = sin (kx) and φ2 = cos (kx) as the degenerate eigenfunctions of H with the same eigenvalue\n'2k2 . We now want to find with this method the common eigenfunctions of pˆ. We first need to find the matrix c (here a 2 × 2\nEk =\n2m\nmatrix), by applying pˆ to the eigenfunctions.\ndφ1\npφ\nˆ\n1 = -ii\n= iik cos (kx) = -iikφ2\ndx\nand ˆ\n=\nc is:\npφ2\niikφ1. Then the matrix\n\niik\nc =\n-iik\nwith eigenvalues bj = ±ik, and eigenvectors (not normalized)\n-i\ni\nv =\n,\nv =\nWe then write the ψ eigenfunctions:\n-ikx\nikx\nψ = v1 φ1 + v2 φ2 = -i sin(kx) + cos(kx) ∝ e\n,\nψ = v1 φ1 + v2 φ2 = i sin(kx) + cos(kx) ∝ e\nB. Complete set of commuting observables\nWe have seen that if an eigenvalue is degenerate, more than one eigenfunction is associated with it. Then, if we\nmeasure the observable A obtaining a we still do not know what the state of the system after the measurement is.\nIf we take another observable B that commutes with A we can measure it and obtain b. We have thus acquired\nsome extra information about the state, since we know that it is now in a common eigenstate of both A and B\nwith the eigenvalues a and b. Still, this could be not enough to fully define the state, if there is more than one state\nφab. We can then look for another observable C, that commutes with both A and B and so on, until we find a set\nof observables such that upon measuring them and obtaining the eigenvalues a, b, c, d, . . . the function φabcd... is\nuniquely defined. Then the set of operators {A, B, C, D, . . . } is called a complete set of commuting observables. The\neigenvalues a, b, c, d, . . . that specify the state are called good quantum numbers and the state is written in Dirac\nnotation as |a b c d . . .).\nObs. The set of commuting observable is not unique.\n2.5.3 Uncertainty principle\nA. Uncertainty for waves\nThe uncertainty principle, which you probably already heard of, is not found just in QM. Consider for example the\npropagation of a wave. If you shake a rope rhythmically, you generate a stationary wave, which is not localized (where\nis the wave??) but it has a well defined wavelength (and thus a momentum).\nDi\nagr\nam\nsho\nwing a continuous stationary sine wave pattern propagating down a rope.\nx (feet)\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\nFig. 12: A wave with a well defined wavelength but no well-defined position.\nIf instead you give a sudden jerk, you create a well localized wavepacket. Now however the wavelength is not well\ndefined (since we have a superposition of waves with many wavelengths). The position and wavelength cannot thus\nbe well defined at the same time. In QM we express this fact with an inequality involving position and momentum\n2π'\n'\np =\n. Then we have σxσp ≥ . We are now going to express these ideas in a more rigorous way.\nλ\n\nD E\nD E\nP Diagram showing a wave packet, or a single pulse, traveling down a rope.\nx (feet)\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\nFig. 13: A wave packet with a well defined position but no well-defined wavelength. (From Griffith)\nB. Repeated measurements\nRecall that the third postulate states that after a measurement the wavefunction collapses to the eigenfunction of\nthe eigenvalue observed.\nLet us assume that I make two measurements of the same operator A one after the other (no evolution, or time to\nmodify the system in between measurements). In the first measurement I obtain the outcome ak (an eigenvalue of\nA). Then for QM to be consistent, it must hold that the second measurement also gives me the same answer ak. How\nis this possible? We know that if the system is in the state ψ = P\nk ckφk, with φk the eigenfunction corresponding to\nthe eigenvalue ak (assume no degeneracy for simplicity), the probability of obtaining ak is |ck|2. If I want to impose\nthat |ck|2 = 1, I must set the wavefunction after the measurement to be ψ = φk (as all the other ch, h = k are zero).\nThis is the so-called collapse of the wavefunction. It is not a mysterious accident, but it is a prescription that ensures\nthat QM (and experimental outcomes) are consistent (thus it's included in one of the postulates).\nNow consider the case in which we make two successive measurements of two different operators, A and B. First we\nmeasure A and obtain ak. We now know that the state of the system after the measurement must be φk. We now\nhave two possibilities.\nIf [A, B] = 0 (the two operator commute, and again for simplicity we assume no degeneracy) then φk is also an\neigenfunction of B. Then, when we measure B we obtain the outcome bk with certainty. There is no uncertainty\nin the measurement. If I measure A again, I would still obtain ak. If I inverted the order of the measurements, I\nwould have obtained the same kind of results (the first measurement outcome is always unknown, unless the system\nis already in an eigenstate of the operators).\nThis is not so surprising if we consider the classical point of view, where measurements are not probabilistic in nature.\nThe second scenario is if [A, B] = 0. Then, φk is not an eigenfunction of B but instead can be written in terms of\nP\nk\neigenfunctions of B, φk =\nψh (where ψh are eigenfunctions of B with eigenvalue bh). A measurement of B does\nh ch\nk |2\nnot have a certain outcome. We would obtain bh with probability |c\n.\nh\nThere is then an intrinsic uncertainty in the successive measurement of two non-commuting observables. Also, the\nresults of successive measurements of A, B and A again, are different if I change the order B, A and B.\nIt means that if I try to know with certainty the outcome of the first observable (e.g. by preparing it in an eigen\nfunction) I have an uncertainty in the other observable. We saw that this uncertainty is linked to the commutator of\nthe two observables. This statement can be made more precise.\n- Theorem: Define C = [A, B] and ΔA and ΔB the uncertainty in the measurement outcomes of A and B: ΔA2 =\nA2\nˆ\n-(A) , where\nO is the expectation value of the operator Oˆ (that is, the average over the possible outcomes,\nˆ\nfor a given state:\nO = (ψ|Oˆ|ψ) =\nOk|ck|2).\nk\nThen:\nΔAΔB ≥ | (C) |\nThis is Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\nExample - The most important example is the uncertainty relation between position and momentum. We know that\nthese two operators do not commute and their commutator is [ˆx, pˆ] = ii.

If the wavefunction is given by just its time-independent part,\nψ(x, t) = φ(x), the state is stationary. Thus, the time-independent Schr odinger equation allows us to find stationary\nstates of the system, given a certain Hamiltonian.\nNotice that the time-independent Schr odinger equation is nothing else than the eigenvalue equation for the Hamil\ntonian operator.\nThe energy of a particle has contributions from the kinetic energy as well as the potential energy:\nH =\n(ˆp\np\np\nx, ˆ z)\n+ ˆ + ˆ ) + V (ˆ y, ˆ\nx\ny\nz\n2m\nor more explicitly:\n12 ∂2\n∂2\n∂2\nH = -\n+\n+\n+ V (x, y, z)\n2m\n∂x2\n∂y2\n∂z2\nwhich can be written in a compact form as\n∇2\nH = -\n+V (x, y, z)\n2m\n(Notice that V (x, y, z) is just a multiplicative operator, in the same way as the position is).\nIn 1D, for a free particle there is no potential energy, but only kinetic energy that we can rewrite as:\n12 ∂2\nH =\np = -\n2m\n2m ∂x2\nThe eigenvalue problem Hwn(x) = Enwn(x) is then the differential equation\n∂2 wn(x)\nHwn(x) = Enwn(x)\n→\n-\n= Enwn(x)\n2m\n∂x2\nFor a free particle there is no restriction on the possible energies, En can be any positive number. The solution to\nthe eigenvalue problem is then the eigenfunction:\niknx\n-iknx\nwn(x) = A sin(knx) + B cos(knx) = A ′ e\n+ B ′ e\nwhich represents two waves traveling in opposite directions.\nWe see that there are two independent functions for each eigenvalue En. Also there are two distinct momentum\neigenvalues ±kn for each energy eigenvalue, which correspond to two different directions of propagation of the wave\n±iknx\nfunction e\n.\n\n3.2 Unbound Problems in Quantum Mechanics\nWe will then solve the time-independent Schr odinger equation in some interesting 1D cases that relate to scattering\nproblems.\n3.2.1 Infinite barrier\nWe first consider a potential as in Fig. 14. We consider two cases:\n- Case A. The system (a particle) has a total energy larger than the potential barrier E > VH .\n- Case B. The energy is smaller than the potential barrier, E < VH .\nVH\nRegion I\nRegion II\nx\nE2\nE1\nV(x)\nFig. 14: Potential function and total energy of the particle\nLet's first consider the classical problem. The system is a rigid ball with total energy E given by the sum of the\nkinetic and potential energy. If we keep the total energy fixed, the kinetic energies are different in the two regions:\nTI = E\nTII = E - VH\np\nIf E > VH , the kinetic energy in region two is TII =\n= E - VH , yielding simply a reduced velocity for the particle.\n2m\nIf E < VH instead, we would obtain a negative TII kinetic energy. This is not an allowed solution, but it means that\nthe particle cannot travel into Region II and it's instead confined in Region I: The particle bounces off the potential\nbarrier.\nIn quantum mechanics we need to solve the Schr odinger equation in order to find the wavefunction describing the\nparticle at any position. The time-independent Schr odinger equation is\n\n- n2 d2 ψ(x)\n12d2\n= E ψ(x) in Region I\n2m\ndx2\nHψ(x) = -\nψ(x) + V (x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n→\n- n2\nψ(x)\n2mdx2\nd2\n= (E - VH )ψ(x) in Region II\n2m\ndx2\nThe two cases differ because in Region II the energy difference ΔE = E - VH is either positive or negative.\nA. Positive energy\nLet's first consider the case in which ΔE = E - VH > 0. In both regions the particle behaves as a free particle with\nenergy EI = E and EII = E - VH . We have already seen the solutions to such differential equation. These are:\nAeikx + Be-ikx\nψI (x) =\nx\nx\nCeik ′ + De-ik ′\nψII (x) =\nk2\nn2\n′ 2\nk\nwhere n2\n= E and\n= E - VH .\n2m\n2m\nikx\n-ikx\nWe already interpreted the function e\nas a wave traveling from left to right and e\nas a wave traveling from\nright to left. We then consider a case similar to the classical case, in which a ball was sent toward a barrier. Then the\nparticle is initially described as a wave traveling from left to right in Region I. At the potential barrier the particle\ncan either be reflected, giving rise to a wave traveling from right to left in Region I, or be transmitted, yielding a\n\nwave traveling from left to right in Region II. This solution is described by the equations above if we set D = 0,\nimplying that there is no wave originating from the far right.\nSince the wavefunction should describe a physical situation, we want it to be a continuous function and with con\ntinuous derivative. Thus we have to match the solution values and their derivatives at the boundary x = 0. This\nwill give equations for the coefficients, allowing us to find the exact solution of the Schr odinger equation. This is a\nboundary conditions problem.\nFrom\nψI (0) = ψII (0) and ψ ′\nII (0)\nI (0) = ψ ′\nand D = 0 we obtain the conditions:\nA + B = C,\nik(A - B) = ik ′ C\nwith solutions\nk - k ′\n2k\nB =\nA,\nC =\nA\nk + k′\nk + k′\nWe can further find A by interpreting the wavefunction in terms of a flux of particles. We thus fix the incoming wave\nV\nmΓ\nflux to be Γ which sets |A| =\n(we can consider A to be a real, positive number for simplicity). Then we have:\nnk\nJ\nJ\nk - k ′\nmΓ\n2k\nmΓ\nB =\n,\nC =\nk + k′\n1k\nk + k′\n1k\nWe can also verify the following identity\nk|A|2 = k|B|2 + k ′ |C|2\nwhich follows from:\n|A|2\n(k - k ′ )2 + 4k ′ k\nk|B|2 + k ′ |C|2 =\n[k(k - k ′ )2 + k ′ (2k)2] = k|A|2\n(k + k′ )2\n(k + k′)2\nLet us multiply it by 1/m:\n1k\n1k\n1k ′\n|C|2\n|A|2 =\n|B|2 +\nm\nm\nm\nAeikx\nnk\nRecall (page 26) the interpretation of ψ(x) =\nas a wave giving a flux of particles |ψ(x)|2v = |A|2\n. This\nm\nrelationship similarly holds for the flux in region II as well as for the reflected flux. Then we can interpret the\nequality above as an equality of particle flux:\nnk\nnk\nnk\nThe incoming flux Γ =\n|A|2 is equal to the sum of the reflected ΓR =\n|B|2 and transmitted ΓT =\n|C|2 fluxes.\nm\nm\nm\nThe particle flux is conserved. We can then define the reflection and transmission coefficients as:\nΓ = ΓR + ΓT = RΓ + TΓ\nwhere\nk|B|2\nk - k ′\nk ′ |C|2\n2k\nk ′\nR =\n=\n,\nT =\n=\nk|A|2\nk + k′\nk|A|2\nk + k′\nk\nIt's then easy to see that T + R = 1 and we can interpret the reflection and transmission coefficients as the reflection\nand transmission probability, respectively.\nIn line with the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, we see that the solution of the Schr odinger equation\ndoes not give us a precise location for the particle. Instead it describes the probability of finding the particle at any\npoint in space. Given the wavefunction found above we can then calculate various quantity of interest, such as the\nprobability of the particle having a given momentum, position and energy.\nB. Negative energy\nNow we turn to the case where E < VH , so that ΔE < 0. In the classical case we saw that this implied the\nimpossibility for the ball to be in region II. In quantum mechanics we cannot simply guess a solution based on our\nintuition, but we need again to solve the Schr odinger equation. The only difference is that now in region II we have\n′′ 2\nn 2k\n= E - VH < 0.\n2m\nAs quantum mechanics is defined in a complex space, this does not pose any problem (we can have negative kinetic\nenergies even if the total energy is positive) and we can solve for k ′′ simply finding an imaginary number k ′′ = iκ,\nV\n2m\nκ =\n2 (VH - E) (with κ real).\nn\n\nThe solutions to the eigenvalue problem are similar to what already seen:\nAeikx + Be-ikx\nψI (x) =\nCeik ′′ x\nCe-κx\nψII (x) =\n=\n,\nwhere we took D = 0 as before.\nQuantum mechanics allows the particle to enter the classical forbidden region, but the wavefunction becomes a\nvanishing exponential function. This means that even if the particle can indeed enter the forbidden region, it cannot\ngo very far, the probability of finding the particle far away from the potential barrier (given by P (x > 0) = |ψII (x)|2 =\n|C|2e-2κx) becomes smaller and smaller.\nAgain we match the function and its derivatives at the boundary to find the coefficients:\nψI (0) = ψII (0)\n→ A + B = C\nψI\n′ (0) = ψII\n′ (0)\n→ ik(A - B) = -κC\nwith solutions\nk - iκ\n2k\nB =\nA,\nC =\nA\nk + iκ\nk + iκ\nThe situation in terms of flux is instead quite different. We now have the equality: k|B|2 = k|A|2:\nk|B|2 = k k - iκ\nk + iκ\nk2 + κ2\n= k\n= k.\nk2 + κ2\nIn terms of flux, we can write this relationship as Γ = ΓR, which implies R = 1 and T = 0. Thus we have no\ntransmission, just perfect reflection, although there is a penetration of the probability in the forbidden region. This\ncan be called an evanescent transmitted wave.\n3.2.2 Finite barrier\nWe now consider a different potential which creates a finite barrier of height VH between x = 0 and L. As depicted\nin Fig. 15 this potential divides the space in 3 regions. Again we consider two cases, where the total energy of the\nparticle is greater or smaller than VH . Classically, we consider a ball initially in Region I. Then in the case where\nVH\nRegion I\nRegion II\nRegion III\nL\nx\nE2\nE1\nV(x)\nFig. 15: Finite barrier potential\nE > VH the ball can travel everywhere, in all the three regions, while for E < VH it is going to be confined in Region\nI, and we have perfect reflection. We will consider now the quantum mechanical case.\nA. Positive kinetic energy\nFirst we consider the case where ΔE = E - VH > 0. The kinetic energies in the three regions are\nRegion I\nRegion II\nRegion III\n′ 2\nk2\nk2\nn\nn k\nn\nT =\n= E\nT =\n= E - VH\nT =\n= E\n2m\n2m\n2m\n\nAnd the wavefunction is\nRegion I\nRegion II\nRegion III\nAeikx + Be-ikx\nCeik ′ x + De-ik ′ x\nEeikx\n(again we put the term Fe-ikx = 0 for physical reasons, in analogy with the classical case studied). The coefficients\ncan be calculated by considering the boundary conditions.\nIn particular, we are interested in the probability of transmission of the beam through the barrier and into region\nIII. The transmission coefficient is then the ratio of the outgoing flux in Region III to the incoming flux in Region I\n(both of these fluxes travel to the Right, so we label them by R):\nk|ψR |2\nk|E|2\n|E|2\nIII\nT =\n=\n=\nk|ψR|2\nk|A|2\n|A|2\nI\nwhile the reflection coefficient is the ratio of the reflected (from right to left, labeled L) and incoming (from left to\nright, labeled R) flux in Region I:\nk|ψL|2\nk|B|2\n|B|2\nI\nR =\n=\n=\nk|ψR|2\nk|A|2\n|A|2\nI\nWe can solve explicitly the boundary conditions:\nψI (0) = ψII (0)\nψII (L) = ψIII (L)\nψI\n′ (0) = ψ ′\nψ ′\n= ψ ′\nII (0)\nII (L)\nIII (L)\nand find the coefficients B, C, D, E (A is determined from the flux intensity Γ . From the full solution we can verify\nthat T + R = 1, as it should be physically.\nObs. Notice that we could also have found a different solution, e.g. in which we set F\n0 and A =\n=\n0, corresponding\nto a particle originating from the right.\nB. Negative Energy\nIn the case where ΔE = E - VH < 0, in region II we expect as before an imaginary momentum. In fact we find\nRegion I\nRegion II\nRegion III\nV\nV\nV\n2mE\n2m(VH-E)\n2mE\nk =\nk ′ = iκ, κ =\nk =\nn\nn\nn\nAnd the wavefunction is\nRegion I\nRegion II\nRegion III\nAeikx + Be-ikx\nCe-κx + Deκx\nEeikx\nThe difference here is that a finite transmission through the barrier is possible and the transmission coefficient is\nnot zero. Indeed, from the full solution of the boundary condition problem, we can find as in the previous case the\ncoefficients T and R and we have T + R = 1.\nThere is thus a probability that the particle tunnels through the finite barrier and appears in Region III, then\ncontinuing to x →inf.\nObs. Although we have been describing the situation in terms of wave traveling in one direction or the other, what\nwe are describing here is not a time-dependent problem. There is no time-dependence at all in this problem (all the\nsolutions are only a function of x, not of time). This is the same situation as stationary waves for example in a rope.\nThe state of the system is not evolving. It is always (at any time) described by the same waves and thus at any time\nwe will have the same outcomes and probability outcomes for any measurement.\nC. Estimates and scaling\nInstead of solving exactly the problem for the second case, we try to make some estimates in the case there is a\nvery small tunneling probability. In this case we have the following approximations for the coefficients A, B, C and\nD.\n- Assuming T ≪ 1 we expect D ≈ 0 since if there is a very small probability for the particle to be in region III, the\nprobability of coming back from it through the barrier must be even smaller (in other words, if D\n0 we would\n=\nhave an increasing probability to have a wave coming out of the barrier).\n- Also, T ≪ 1 implies R ≈ 1. This means that B/A ≈ 1 or B ≈ A.\n\n- Matching the wavefunction at x = 0, we have C = A + B ≈ 2A.\n- Finally matching the wavefunction at x = L we obtain:\nCe-κL\n2Ae-κL\nEeikL\nψ(L) =\n=\n=\nk|ψR\n|2\nWe can then calculate the transmission probability T from T =\nIII\n, with these assumptions. We obtain\nk|ψR|2\nI\n-2κL\nk|E|2\n|E|2\n4|A|2e\n-2κL\nT =\n=\n=\n→ T = 4e\nk|A|2\n|A|2\n|A|2\nThus the transmission probability depends on the length of the potential barrier (the longer the barrier the less\ntransmission we have, as it is intuitive) and on the coefficient κ. Notice that κ depends on the difference between the\nparticle energy and the potential strength: If the particle energy is near the edge of the potential barrier (that is,\nΔE ≈ 0) then κ ≈ 0 and there's a high probability of tunneling. This case is however against our first assumptions\nof small tunneling (that's why we obtain the unphysical result that T ≈ 4!!). The case we are considering is instead\nwhere the particle energy is small compared to the potential, so that κ is large, and the particle has a very low\nprobability of tunneling through.\n\n3.3 Alpha decay\nIf we go back to the binding energy per mass number plot (B/A vs. A) we see that there is a bump (a peak) for\nA ∼ 60 - 100. This means that there is a corresponding minimum (or energy optimum) around these numbers. Then\nthe heavier nuclei will want to decay toward this lighter nuclides, by shedding some protons and neutrons. More\nspecifically, the decrease in binding energy at high A is due to Coulomb repulsion. Coulomb repulsion grows in fact\nas Z2, much faster than the nuclear force which is ∝ A.\nThis could be thought as a similar process to what happens in the fission process: from a parent nuclide, two daughter\nnuclides are created. In the α decay we have specifically:\nA\nA-4\n′\nZ XN -→\nXN -2 + α\nZ-2\nwhere α is the nucleus of He-4: 4\n2He2.\nThe α decay should be competing with other processes, such as the fission into equal daughter nuclides, or into pairs\nincluding 12C or 16O that have larger B/A then α. However α decay is usually favored. In order to understand this,\nwe start by looking at the energetic of the decay, but we will need to study the quantum origin of the decay to arrive\nat a full explanation.\nα Particle\n4He\nSchematic of alpha particle decay, showing the particle as a nucleus of He-4.\nFig. 16: Alpha decay schematics\n3.3.1 Energetics\nIn analyzing a radioactive decay (or any nuclear reaction) an important quantity is Q, the net energy released in the\n′\n′\ndecay: Q = (mX - mX - mα)c2. This is also equal to the total kinetic energy of the fragments, here Q = TX + Tα\n(here assuming that the parent nuclide is at rest).\nWhen Q > 0 energy is released in the nuclear reaction, while for Q < 0 we need to provide energy to make the\nreaction happen. As in chemistry, we expect the first reaction to be a spontaneous reaction, while the second one\ndoes not happen in nature without intervention. (The first reaction is exo-energetic the second endo-energetic).\nNotice that it's no coincidence that it's called Q. In practice given some reagents and products, Q give the quality of\nthe reaction, i.e. how energetically favorable, hence probable, it is. For example in the alpha-decay log (t1/2) ∝\nQα\n√1\n,\nwhich is the Geiger-Nuttall rule (1928).\nThe alpha particle carries away most of the kinetic energy (since it is much lighter) and by measuring this kinetic\nenergy experimentally it is possible to know the masses of unstable nuclides.\nWe can calculate Q using the SEMF. Then:\n′\n= B(A-4XN-2) + B(4He) - B(A\n= B(A - 4, Z - 2) - B(A, Z) + B(4He)\nQα\nZ XN )\nZ-2\nWe can approximate the finite difference with the relevant gradient:\n∂B\n∂B\nQα = [B(A - 4, Z - 2) - B(A, Z - 2)] + [B(A, Z - 2) - B(A, Z)] + B(4He) ≈= -4\n- 2\n+ B(4He)\n∂A\n∂Z\nZ\nZ\n2Z\nA-7/4\n= 28.3 - 4av +\nasA-1/3 + 4ac 1 -\n- 4asym 1 -\n+ 3ap\nA1/3\n3A\nA\n\nSince we are looking at heavy nuclei, we know that Z ≈ 0.41A (instead of Z ≈ A/2) and we obtain\nQα ≈-36.68 + 44.9A-1/3 + 1.02A2/3 ,\nwhere the second term comes from the surface contribution and the last term is the Coulomb term (we neglect the\npairing term, since a priori we do not know if ap is zero or not).\nThen, the Coulomb term, although small, makes Q increase at large A. We find that Q ≥ 0 for A & 150, and it is\nQ ≈ 6MeV for A = 200. Although Q > 0, we find experimentally that α decay only arise for A ≥ 200.\nFurther, take for example Francium-200 (200 Fr113). If we calculate Qα from the experimentally found mass differences\nwe obtain Qα ≈ 7.6MeV (the product is 196At). We can do the same calculation for the hypothetical decay into a\n12C and remaining fragment (188\n81 Tl 107 ):\nZ XN ) - m(A-12\n′\nQ12C = c 2[m(A\nXN-6) - m(12C)] ≈ 28MeV\nZ-6\nThus this second reaction seems to be more energetic, hence more favorable than the alpha-decay, yet it does not\noccur (some decays involving C-12 have been observed, but their branching ratios are much smaller).\nThus, looking only at the energetic of the decay does not explain some questions that surround the alpha decay:\n- Why there's no 12C-decay? (or to some of this tightly bound nuclides, e.g O-16 etc.)\n- Why there's no spontaneous fission into equal daughters?\n- Why there's alpha decay only for A ≥ 200?\n√1\n- What is the explanation of Geiger-Nuttall rule? log t1/2 ∝\nQα\n3.3.2 Quantum mechanics description of alpha decay\nWe will use a semi-classical model (that is, combining quantum mechanics with classical physics) to answer the\nquestions above.\nIn order to study the quantum mechanical process underlying alpha decay, we consider the interaction between the\ndaughter nuclide and the alpha particle. Just prior to separation, we can consider this pair to be already present\ninside the parent nuclide, in a bound state. We will describe this pair of particles in their center of mass coordinate\nframes: thus we are interested in the relative motion (and kinetic energy) of the two particles. As often done in these\nsituations, we can describe the relative motion of two particles as the motion of a single particle of reduced mass\n′\nmαm\n′\nμ =\n(where m is the mass of the daughter nuclide).\nmα+m ′\nConsider for example the reaction 238U→234Th+α. What is the interaction between the Th and alpha particle in\nthe bound state?\n- At short distance we have the nuclear force binding the 238 U.\n- At long distances, the coulomb interaction predominates\nThe nuclear force is a very strong, attractive force, while the Coulomb force among protons is repulsive and will tend\nto expel the alpha particle.\nSince the final state is known to have an energy Qα = 4.3MeV, we will take this energy to be as well the initial\nenergy of the two particles in the potential well (we assume that Qα = E since Q is the kinetic energy while the\npotential energy is zero). The size of the potential well can be calculated as the sum of the daughter nuclide (234 Th)\nand alpha radii:\nR = R ′ + Rα = R0((234)1/3 + 41/3) = 9.3fm.\n′\nOn the other side, the Coulomb energy at this separation is VCoul = e2Z ′ Zα/R = 28MeV ≫ Qα (here Z = Z - 2 ).\nThen, the particles are inside a well, with a high barrier (as VCoul ≫ Q) but there is some probability of tunneling,\nsince Q > 0 and the state is not stably bound.\nThus, if the parent nuclide, 238U, was really composed of an alpha-particle and of the daughter nuclide, 234Th,\nthen with some probability the system would be in a bound state and with some probability in a decayed state,\nwith the alpha particle outside the potential barrier. This last probability can be calculated from the tunneling\nprobability PT we studied in the previous section, given by the amplitude square of the wavefunction outside the\nbarrier, PT = |ψ(Rout)|2 .\nHow do we relate this probability to the decay rate?\nWe need to multiply the probability of tunneling PT by the frequency f at which 238 U could actually be found as\nbeing in two fragments 234Th+α (although still bound together inside the potential barrier). The decay rate is then\ngiven by λα = f PT .\nTo estimate the frequency f, we equate it with the frequency at which the compound particle in the center of mass\nframe is at the well boundary: f = vin/R, where vin is the velocity of the particles when they are inside the well\n\n-2\nQα\nV Z\nMeV\nNucleus-α separation (fm)\n...\nR\nRc\nFig. 17: Potential well for alpha decay tunneling.

We have 1mv\n= Qα + V0 ≈ 40MeV, from which we have vin ≈ 4 × 1022fm/s. Then the\nin\nfrequency is f ≈ 4.3 × 1021 .\nThe probability of tunneling is given by the amplitude square of the wavefunction just outside the barrier, PT =\n|ψ(Rc)|2, where Rc is the coordinate at which VCoul(Rc) = Qα, such that the particle has again a positive kinetic\nenergy:\n′\ne2ZαZ\nRc =\n≈ 63fm\nQα\nRecall that in the case of a square barrier, we expressed the wavefunction inside a barrier (in the classically forbidden\nregion) as a plane wave with imaginary momentum, hence a decaying exponential ψin(r) ∼ e-κr. What is the relevant\nmomentum 1κ here? Since the potential is no longer a square barrier, we expect the momentum (and kinetic energy)\nto be a function of position.\n\nThe total energy is given by E = Qα and is the sum of the potential (Coulomb) and kinetic energy. As we've seen\nthat the Coulomb energy is higher than Q, we know that the kinetic energy is negative:\n12k2\nZαZ ′ e2\nQα = T + VCoul =\n+\n2μ\nr\nwith μ the reduced mass\n′\nmαm\nμ =\nm ′\nmα +\nand k2 = -κ2 (with κ ∈ R). This equation is valid at any position inside the barrier:\n\nJ\n′ e2\nκ(r) =\n2μ\n2μ\nZαZ\n[VCoul(r) - Qα] =\n- Qα\nr\nIf we were to consider a small slice of the barrier, from r to r + dr, then the probability to pass through this barrier\nwould be dPT (r) = e-2κ(r)dr. If we divide then the total barrier range into small slices, the final probability is the\nproduct of the probabilities dP k of passing through all of the slices. Then log (PT ) = L log(dP k) and taking the\nT\nk\nT\nJ Rc\nJ Rc\ncontinuous limit log (PT ) =\nlog [dPT (r)] = -2\nκ(r)dr.\nR\nR\nFinally the probability of tunneling is given by PT = e-2G, where G is calculated from the integral\n\nRC\nRC\n′ e2\nG =\ndrκ(r) =\ndr\n2μ\nZαZ\n- Qα\nr\nR\nR\nZαZ ′ e\nWe can solve the integral analytically, by letting r = Rcy = y\nQα\n, then\n\nJ\nZαZ0e\n2μc2\nG =\ndy\n- 1\n1c\nQα\ny\nR/RC\nwhich yields\n′ 2\n\"\nJ\n!\nJ\nJ\n#\n′ 2\nJ\n!\nZαZ e\n2μc2\nR\nR\nR\nZαZ e\n2μc2 π\nR\nG =\narccos\n-\n1 -\n=\ng\n1c\nQα\nRc\nRc\nRc\n1c\nQα 2\nRc\nwhere to simplify the notation we used the function\n2 (\nJ\n)\ng(x) =\narccos(x) - x\n1 - x2\n.\nπ\nFinally the decay rate is given by\nvin -2G\nλα =\ne\nR\nwhere G is the so-called Gamow factor.\nIn order to get some insight on the behavior of G we consider the approximation R ≪ Rc:\n\nJ\n!\n\n\"\n#\nJ\nEG\nR\nEG\nR\nG =\ng\n≈\n1 -\nQα\nRc\nQα\nπ\nRc\nwhere EG is the Gamow energy:\nEG =\n2πZαZe2\n1c\n2 μc2\n(V\n)\nFor example for the 238U decay studied EG = 122, 000MeV (huge!) so that\nJ\nEG/Qα = 171 while g\nR\n≈ 0.518.\nRc\n-2G\n-89\nThe exponent is thus a large number, giving a very low tunneling probabily: e\n= e\n= 4 × 10-39 . Then,\nλα = 1.6 × 10-17s or t1/2 = 4.5 × 109 years, close to what observed.\nThese results finally give an answer to the questions we had regarding alpha decay. The decay probability has a very\nstrong dependence on not only Qα but also on Z1Z2 (where Zi are the number of protons in the two daughters).\nThis leads to the following observations:\n\n- Other types of decay are less likely, because the Coulomb energy would increase considerably, thus the barrier\nbecomes too high to be overcome.\n- The same is true for spontaneous fission, despite the fact that Q is much higher (∼ 200MeV).\n- We thus find that alpha decay is the optimal mechanism. Still, it can happen only for A ≥ 200 exactly because\notherwise the tunneling probability is very small.\n- The Geiger-Nuttall law is a direct consequence of the quantum tunneling theory. Also, the large variations of the\ndecay rates with Q are a consequence of the exponential dependence on Q.\nA final word of caution about the model: the semi-classical model used to describe the alpha decay gives quite\naccurate predictions of the decay rates over many order of magnitudes. However it is not to be taken as an indication\nthat the parent nucleus is really already containing an alpha particle and a daughter nucleus (only, it behaves as if\nit were, as long as we calculate the alpha decay rates).\n\n[This page intentionally blank.]\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

An infinite number of continuous energies were possible solutions to the time-\nindependent Schr odinger equation.\nIn this chapter, we want instead to describe systems which are best described as particles confined inside a potential.\nThis type of system well describe atoms or nuclei whose constituents are bound by their mutual interactions. We\nshall see that because of the particle confinement, the solutions to the energy eigenvalue equation (i.e. the time-\nindependent Schr odinger equation) are now only a discrete set of possible values (a discrete set os energy levels).\nThe energy is therefore quantized. Correspondingly, only a discrete set of eigenfunctions will be solutions, thus the\nsystem, if it's in a stationary state, can only be found in one of these allowed eigenstates.\nWe will start to describe simple examples. However, after learning the relevant concepts (and mathematical tricks)\nwe will see how these same concepts are used to predict and describe the energy of atoms and nuclei. This theory\ncan predict for example the discrete emission spectrum of atoms and the nuclear binding energy.\n4.1.1 Energy in Square infinite well (particle in a box)\nThe simplest system to be analyzed is a particle in a box: classically, in 3D, the particle is stuck inside the box and\ncan never leave. Another classical analogy would be a ball at the bottom of a well so deep that no matter how much\nkinetic energy the ball possess, it will never be able to exit the well.\nWe consider again a particle in a 1D space. However now the particle is no longer free to travel but is confined to be\nbetween the positions 0 and L. In order to confine the particle there must be an infinite force at these boundaries\nthat repels the particle and forces it to stay only in the allowed space. Correspondingly there must be an infinite\npotential in the forbidden region.\nThus the potential function is as depicted in Fig. 20: V (x) = inf for x < 0 and x > L; and V (x) = 0 for 0 ≤ x ≤ L.\nThis last condition means that the particle behaves as a free particle inside the well (or box) created by the potential.\n\nV(x)\nL\nx\nFig. 19: Potential of an infinite well\nWe can then write the energy eigenvalue problem inside the well:\n~2 ∂2 wn(x)\nH[wn] = -\n= Enwn(x)\n2m\n∂x2\nOutside the well we cannot write a proper equation because of the infinities. We can still set the values of wn(x) at\nthe boundaries 0, L. Physically, we expect wn(x) = 0 in the forbidden region. In fact, we know that ψ(x) = 0 in the\nforbidden region (since the particle has zero probability of being there) 6. Then if we write any ψ(x) in terms of the\nenergy eigenfunctions, ψ(x) = L cnwn(x) this has to be zero ∀cn in the forbidden region, thus the wn have to be\nn\nzero.\nAt the boundaries we can thus write the boundary conditions7:\nwn(0) = wn(L) = 0\nWe can solve the eigenvalue problem inside the well as done for the free particle, obtaining the eigenfunctions\n′\niknx\n-iknx\nw (x) = A ′ e\n+ B ′ e\n,\nn\n12k2\nn\nwith eigenvalues En =\n.\n2m\nIt is easier to solve the boundary conditions by considering instead:\nwn(x) = A sin(knx) + B cos(knx).\nWe have:\nwn(0) = A × 0 + B × 1 = B = 0\nThus from wn(0) = 0 we have that B = 0. The second condition states that\nwn(L) = A sin(knL) = 0\nThe second condition thus does not set the value of A (that can be done by the normalization condition). In order\nto satisfy the condition, instead, we have to set\nnπ\nknL = nπ → kn = L\nfor integer n. This condition then in turns sets the allowed values for the energies:\n~2k2\n~2π2\nn\n2 ≡ E1n 2\nEn =\n=\nn\n2m\n2mL2\n12π2\nwhere we set E1 = 2mL2 and n is called a quantum number (associated with the energy eigenvalue).\nFrom this, we see that only some values of the energies are allowed. There are still an infinite number of energies,\nbut now they are not a continuous set. We say that the energies are quantized. The quantization of energies (first\n6 Note that this is true because the potential is infinite. The energy eigenvalue function (for the Hamiltonian operator) is always\nvalid. The only way for the equation to be valid outside the well it is if wn(x) = 0\n7 Note that in this case we cannot require that the first derivative be continuous, since the potential becomes infinity at the\nboundary. In the cases we examined to describe scattering, the potential had only discontinuity of the first kind.\n\nV(x)\nEn\nL\nx\nFig. 20: Quantized energy levels (En for n = 0 -4) in red. Also, in green the position probability distribution |wn(x)|2\nthe photon energies in black-body radiation and photo-electric effect, then the electron energies in the atom) is\nwhat gave quantum mechanics its name. However, as we saw from the scattering problems in the previous chapter,\nthe quantization of energies is not a general property of quantum mechanical systems. Although this is common\n(and the rule any time that the particle is bound, or confined in a region by a potential) the quantization is always\na consequence of a particular characteristic of the potential. There exist potentials (as for the free particle, or in\ngeneral for unbound particles) where the energies are not quantized and do form a continuum (as in the classical\ncase).\nFinally we calculate the normalization of the energy eigenfunctions:\n\nZ inf\nZ L\nL\n|2\nA2\ndx |wn\n= 1\n→\nA2 sin(knx)2dx =\n= 1\n→ A =\nL\n-inf\nNotice that because the system is bound inside a well defined region of space, the normalization condition has\nnow a very clear physical meaning (and thus we must always apply it): if the system is represented by one of\nthe eigenfunctions (and it is thus stationary) we know that it must be found somewhere between 0 and L. Thus\nthe probability of finding the system somewhere in that region must be one. This corresponds to the condition\nJ L\nJ L\np(x)dx = 1 or\n|ψ(x)|2dx = 1.\nFinally, we have\n\n2π2\nwn(x) =\nnπ , En =\nn 2\nsin knx, kn =\nL\nL\n2mL2\nI\n( nπx )\nNow assume that a particle is in an energy eigenstate, that is ψ(x) = wn(x) for some n: ψ(x) =\nsin\n.

The physical picture modeled by this potential is that of a\nbound particle. Specifically if we consider the case where the total energy of the particle E2 < 0 is negative, then\nclassically we would expect the particle to be trapped inside the potential well. This is similar to what we already\nsaw when studying the infinite well. Here however the height of the well is finite, so that we will see that the quantum\nmechanical solution allows for a finite penetration of the wavefunction in the classically forbidden region.\n? Question: What is the expect behavior of a classical particle? (consider for example a snowboarder in a half-pipe.\nIf she does not have enough speed she's not going to be able to jump over the slope, and will be confined inside).\n-VH\na\n-a\nx\nE2=-E\nE1=+E\nV(x)\nRegion I\nRegion II\nRegion III\nFig. 22: Potential of a finite well. The potential is non-zero and equal to -VH in the region -a ≤ x ≤ a.\nFor a quantum mechanical particle we want instead to solve the Schr odinger equation. We consider two cases. In the\nfirst case, the kinetic energy is always positive:\n\nψ(x)\n- 12 d2\n= Eψ(x) in Region I\n2m\ndx2\n2 d2 ψ(x)\n- 1\n2m\ndx2\n= (E + VH )ψ(x) in Region II\nψ(x)\n- 12 d2\n= Eψ(x) in Region III\n2m\ndx2\n2d2\nHψ(x) = -\nψ(x) + V (x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n→\n2mdx2\nso we expect to find a solution in terms of traveling waves. This is not so interesting, we only note that this describes\nthe case of an unbound particle. The solutions will be similar to scattering solutions (see mathematica demonstration).\nIn the second case, the kinetic energy is greater than zero for |x| ≤ a and negative otherwise (since the total energy\nis negative). Notice that I set E to be a positive quantity, and the system's energy is -E. We also assume that\nE < VH . The equations are thus rewritten as:\n\nψ(x)\n- 12 d2\n= -Eψ(x) in Region I\n2m\ndx2\n2d2\n2 d2 ψ(x)\n- 1\n2m\nHψ(x) = -\nψ(x) + V (x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n→\n= (VH - E)ψ(x) in Region II\n2mdx2\ndx2\nψ(x)\n- 12 d2\n= -Eψ(x) in Region III\n2m\ndx2\nI\nThen we expect waves inside the well and an imaginary momentum (yielding exponentially decaying probability of\nfinding the particle) in the outside regions. More precisely, in the 3 regions we find:\nRegion I\nRegion II\nRegion III\n2m(VH+E2)\nk ′ = iκ,\nk =\nk ′ = iκ,\nI\nI\nI\nI\n-2mE2\n2mE\n=\n=\n2m(VH-E)\nκ =\n2mE\nκ =\n\nFig. 23: cot z (Red) and z cot z (Black)\nAnd the wavefunction is\nRegion I\nRegion II\nRegion III\nC ′ e-κ|x|\nA ′ eikx + B ′ e-ikx\nD ′ e-κx\n′\n′\n-κ|x|\nκx. The first notation makes it clear that we have\n(Notice that in the first region I can write either C e\nor C e\nan exponential decay). We now want to match the boundary conditions in order to find the coefficients. Also, we\nremember from the infinite well that the boundary conditions gave us not the coefficient A, B but a condition on the\nallowed values of the energy. We expect something similar here, since the infinite case is just a limit of the present\ncase.\nFirst we note that the potential is an even function of x. The differential operator is also an even function of x. Then\nthe solution has to either be odd or even for the equation to hold. This means that A and B have to be chosen so\nA ′ ikx + B ′\nthat ψ(x) =\ne\ne-ikx is either even or odd. This is arranged by setting ψ(x) = A cos(kx) [even solution] or\n′\nψ(x) = A sin(kx) [odd solution]. Here I choose the odd solution, ψ(-x) = -ψ(x). That also sets C = -D ′ and we\n′\nD ′\nrewrite this constant as -C =\n= C.\nWe then have:\nRegion I\nRegion II\nRegion III\nψ(x) = -Ceκx\nψ(x) = A sin (kx)\nψ(x) = Ce-κx\nψ ′ (x) = -κCeκx\nψ ′ (x) = kA cos (kx)\nψ ′ (x) = -κCe-κx\nSince we know that ψ(-x) = -ψ(x) (odd solution) we can consider the boundary matching condition only at x = a.\nThe two equations are:\n{\nCe-κa\nA sin(ka) =\nAk cos(ka) = -κCe-κa\nSubstituting the first equation into the second we find: Ak cos(ka) = -κA sin(ka). Then we obtain an equation not\nfor the coefficient A (as it was the case for the infinite well) but a constraint on the eigenvalues k and κ:\nκ = -k cot(ka)\nThis is a condition on the eigenvalues that allows only a subset of solutions. This equation cannot be solved analyt\nically, we thus search for a solution graphically (it could be done of course numerically!).\nTo do so, we first make a change of variable, multiplying both sides by a and setting ka = z, κa = z1. Notice that\n2mE\n2m(VH-E)\n2mVHa\n/ 2\nz1 =\na2 and z\n=\na2. Setting z0 =\n2 , we have z1 = z0 - z\nor κa =\nz - z2 .

That is, we plot y1(z) = -\nz - z2 ,\nI\n2mVHa2\nwhich represent a quarter circle (as z is positive) of radius z0 =\nand y2(z) = z cot(z).\nObs. 1 The coefficient A (and thus C and D) can be found (once the eigenfunctions have been found numerically or\ngraphically) by imposing that the eigenfunction is normalized.\nObs. 2 Notice that the first red curve never crosses the blue curves. That means that there are no solutions. If\nz0 < π/2 there are no solutions (That is, if the well is too shallow there are no bound solutions, the particle can\nπ2\nescape). Only if VH >\nthere's a bound solution.\nObs. 3 There's a finite number of solutions, given a value of z0 > π/2. For example, for π/2 ≤ z0 ≤ 3π/2 there's only\none solution, 2 for 3π/2 ≤ z0 ≤ 5π/2, etc.\nRemember however that we only considered the odd solutions. A bound solution is always possible if we consider the\neven solutions., since the equation to be solved is\nI\nκa = ka tan(ka) =\nz - z2 .\nImportantly, we found that for the odd solution there is a minimum size of the potential well (width and depth) that\nsupports bound states. How can we estimate this size? A bound state requires a negative total energy, or a kinetic\nenergy smaller than the potential: Ekin = 12k2\n2m < VH . This poses a constraint on the wavenumber k and thus the\nwavelength, λ = 2π\nk :\n2π\nλ ≥ √ 2mVH\nHowever, in order to satisfy the boundary conditions (that connect the oscillating wavefunction to the exponentially\ndecay one) we need to fit at least half of a wavelength inside the 2a width of the potential.,\nλ ≤ 2a. Then we obtain\nma2\nFig. 26: Even solution for the finite barrier potential. The wavefunction is ∝ cos(kx) in Region II (Black) and an exponential\ndecay in regions I and III (Blue).

Consider for example a spherical\nwell in 3D: The potential is zero inside a region of radius a and is VH for r > a. Then we can rewrite the time-\nindependent Schr odinger equation in 3D for this potential in spherical coordinates and use separation of variables\n({r, θ, φ}). Because of symmetry, the wavefunction is a constant in θ and φ, thus we will have to solve just a single\ndifferential equation for the radial variable, very similar to what found here. We must then choose the odd-parity\nsolution in order to obtain a finite wavefunction at r = 0. Thus in 3D, only the odd solutions are possible and we\nneed a minimum potential well depth in order to find a bound state.\nħ\nħ\n\n~\n~\n~\n~\n4.2 Quantum Mechanics in 3D: Angular momentum\n4.2.1 Schro dinger equation in spherical coordinates\nWe now go back to the time-independent Schr odinger equation\n(\n)\n-\n∇2 + V (x, y, z)\nψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n2m\nWe have already studied some solutions to this equations - for specific potentials in one dimension. Now we want to\nsolve QM problems in 3D. Specifically, we look at 3D problems where the potential V (x) is isotropic, that is, it only\ndepends on the distance from the origin. Then, instead of using cartesian coordinates xx = {x, y, z}, it is convenient\nto use spherical coordinates xx = {r, θ, φ}:\n\n/\n\nr =\nx2 + y2 + z2\nx = r sin θ cos φ\n\n(\n/\n)\ny = r sin θ sin φ\n↔\nθ = arctan z/\nx2 + y2\nx = r cos θ\n\nφ = arctan(y/x)\nz\ny\nx\nφ\nr\nθ\nFig. 27: Spherical Coordinates\nFirst, we express the Laplacian ∇2 in spherical coordinates:\n(\n)\n(\n)\n1 ∂\n2 ∂\n∂\n∂\n∂2\n∇2 =\nr\nsin θ\n+\nr2 ∂r\n∂r\n+ r2 sin θ ∂θ\n∂θ\nr2 sin2 θ ∂φ2\nTo look for solutions, we use again the separation of variable methods, writing ψ(xx) = ψ(r, θ, φ) = R(r)Y (θ, φ):\n2 [ Y d (\nd R )\nR\n∂ (\n∂Y )\nR\n∂2Y ]\n-\nr\nsin θ\n+\n+ V (r)RY = ERY\n2m\nr2 d r\nd r\n+ r2 sin θ ∂θ\n∂θ\nr2 sin2 θ ∂φ2\nWe then divide by RY/r2 and rearrange the terms as\n(\n)]\n[\n(\n)\n]\n[ 1 d\nd R\n∂\n∂Y\n∂2Y\n-\nr\n+ r 2(V - E) =\nsin θ\n2m R d r\nd r\n2mY\nsin θ ∂θ\n∂θ\n+ sin2 θ ∂φ2\nEach side is a function of r only and θ, φ, so they must be independently equal to a constant C that we set (for\nreasons to be seen later) equal to C = - 12 l(l + 1).

From its classical form Lx = xr × px we can define\nthe QM operator:\nx\nˆ\nˆ\nx\nLˆ = xr × pxˆ = -i xr × ∇ˆ\nIn cartesian coordinates this reads\n(\n)\n∂\n∂\nLˆx = yˆpˆz - pˆyzˆ = -i\ny\n-\nz\n∂z\n∂y\n(\n)\n∂\n∂\nLˆy = zˆpˆx - pˆz xˆ = -i\nz\n-\nx\n∂x\n∂z\n(\n)\n∂\n∂\nLˆz = xˆpˆy - pˆxyˆ = -i\nz\n-\ny\n∂y\n∂x\nˆ\nSome very important properties of this vector operator regard its commutator.

Since the different components of the angular momentum do not commute, they do not possess common\neigenvalues and there is an uncertainty relation for them. If for example I know with absolute precision the angular\nmomentum along the z direction, I cannot have any knowledge of the components along x and y.\n? Question: : what is the uncertainty relation for the x and y components?\nΔLxΔLy ≥\n| (Lz ) |\n? Question: Assume we know with certainty the angular momentum along the z direction. What is the uncertainty\nin the angular momentum in the x and y directions?\nFrom the uncertainty relations, ΔLxΔLz ≥ 2\n| (Ly) | and ΔLyΔLz ≥\n| (Lx) |, we have that if ΔLz = 0 (perfect\nknowledge) then we have a complete uncertainty in Lx and Ly.\nObs. Consider the squared length of the angular momentum vector Lˆ2 = Lˆ2 +Lˆ2 +Lˆ2. We can show that [Lˆa, Lˆ2] = 0\nx\ny\nz\n(for a = {x, y, z}). Thus we can always know the length of the angular momentum plus one of its components.\nFor example, choosing the z-component, we can represent the angular momentum as a cone, of length (L), projection\non the z-axis (Lz ) and with complete uncertainty of its projection along x and y.\nWe now express the angular momentum using spherical coordinates.

We can then write the eigenvalue equations\nfor these two operators:\nLˆ2Φ(θ, φ) = ~2l(l + 1)Φ(θ, φ)\nand\nˆLz Φ(θ, φ) = ~mz Φ(θ, φ)\nwhere we already used the fact that they share common eigenfunctions (then, we can label these eigenfunctions by l\nand mz : Φl,mz (θ, φ).\nThe allowed values for l and mz are integers such that l = 0, 1, 2, . . . and mz = -l, . . . , l - 1, l. This result can be\ninferred from the commutation relationship. For interested students, the derivation is below.\nDerivation of the eigenvalues. Assume that the eigenvalues of L2 and Lz are unknown, and call them λ and μ. We\nintroduce two new operators, the raising and lowering operators L+ = Lx +iLy and L- = Lx -iLy. The commutator with Lz\nis [Lz, L±] = ±~L± (while they of course commute with L2). Now consider the function f± = L±f, where f is an eigenfunction\nof L2 and Lz:\nL2f± = L±L2f = L±λf = λf±\nand\nLzf± = [Lz, L±]f + L±Lzf = ±~L±f + L±μf = (μ ± ~)f±\nThen f± = L±f is also an eigenfunction of L2 and Lz. Furthermore, we can keep finding eigenfunctions of Lz with higher and\nhigher eigenvalues μ ′ = μ + + + . . . , by applying the L+ operator (or lower and lower with L-), while the L2 eigenvalue is\nfixed. Of course there is a limit, since we want μ ′ ≤ λ. Then there is a maximum eigenfunction such that L+fM = 0 and we\nset the corresponding eigenvalue to ~lM. Now notice that we can write L2 instead of by using Lx,y by using L±:\nL2 = L-L+ + L2\nz + ~Lz\nUsing this relationship on fM we find:\n~2\nL fm = λfm\n→\n(L-L+ + Lz + ~Lz)fM = [0 + ~2lM + ~(~lM)]fM\n→\nλ =\nlM(lM + 1)\n~2\nIn the same way, there is also a minimum eigenvalue lm and eigenfunction s.t. L-fm = 0 and we can find λ =\nlm(lm -1).\nSince λ is always the same, we also have lm(lm -1) = lM(lM + 1), with solution lm = -lM (the other solution would have\nlm > lM). Finally we have found that the eigenvalues of Lz are between +~l and -~l with integer increases, so that l = -l +N\ngiving l = N/2: that is, l is either an integer or an half-integer. We thus set λ = ~2l(l + 1) and μ = ~m, m = -l, -l + 1, . . . , l.\nWe can gather some intuition about the eigenvalues if we solve first the second equation, finding\n∂Φl,m\nimzφ\n-i\n= ~mz Φ(θ, φ),\nΦl,m(θ, φ) = Θl(θ)e\n∂φ\nwhere, because of the periodicity in φ, mz can only take on integer values (positive and negative) so that Φlm(θ, φ +\n2π) = Φlm(θ, φ).\n\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\nIf we solve the first equation, we would find for each eigenvalue l there are many eigenfunctions. What is the\ndegeneracy of the eigenvalue l? We know that given l, mz can take many values (between -l and l), in particular\n2l + 1 values. This is the degeneracy of l.\n? Question: What are the possible values of Lˆx if l = 7 and mz = 5?\nWe know that we can define quantum numbers mx(y) such that they take integer numbers mx(y) = -l, . . . , l - 1, l.\nAlso, we have the relation among the expectation values:\n\\\n)\n\\\n)\n\\\n)\nLˆ2\n=\nLˆ2 + Lˆ2 + Lˆ2\n→ l(l + 1) = m +\nLˆ2 + Lˆ2\n/\nx\ny\nz\nz\nx\ny\nso in general\n\\\n)\nLˆ2\n≤\n2[l(l + 1) - m ]\nx\nz\nThen here we have\n\\\n)\nLˆ2\n≤\n2(56 - 25) = 31\nx\n\\\n)\nIf Lˆx could only take its maximum value (with probability one) we would have\nLˆ2\n= L PiL2\n= L2\nthus we\nx\nx,i\nx,max\n√\n\\\n)\n\\\n)\nLˆ2\nLˆ2\nhave Lx,max ≤ 5\n(with 5 the closest integer to\n31). Often, because of symmetry, we have\nx\n=\ny\nand,\n\\\n)\nLˆ2\n=\n2[l(l + 1) - m ]/2\nx\nz\nthus restricting even further the maximum value of Lx.\n4.2.3 Spin angular momentum\nThe quantization of angular momentum gave the result that the angular momentum quantum number was defined\nby integer values. There is another quantum operator that has the same commutation relationship as the angular\nmomentum but has no classical counterpart and can assume half-integer values. It is called the intrinsic spin angular\nˆx\nmomentum S (or for short, spin). Because it is not a classical properties, we cannot write spin in terms of position\nand momentum operator. The spin is defined in an abstract spin space (not the usual phase space).\nEvery elementary particle has a specific and immutable value of the intrinsic spin quantum number s (with s\nS2\ndetermining the eigenvalues of ˆ ,\ns(s + 1)), which we call the spin of that particular species: pi mesons have spin\n0; electrons have spin 1/2; photons have spin 1; gravitons have spin 2; and so on. By contrast, the orbital angular\nmomentum quantum number l of a particle can a priori take on any (integer) value, and l will change when the\nsystem is perturbed.\nThe eigenvectors of the spin operators are not spherical harmonics. Actually, since the spin is not defined in terms\nof position and momentum, they are not a function of position and are not defined on the usual phase space. The\neigenstates are instead described by linear vectors, for example, two-dimensional vectors for the spin- 1. Thus the\noperators will be as well represented by matrices.\nWe already saw the operators describing the spin- 1 operators and we even calculated their eigenvalues and eigenvec\ntors (see section 2.2)\nWe can then also define the total angular momentum, which is the sum of the usual angular momentum (called the\norbital angular momentum) and the spin:\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nx\nx\nx\nJ = L + S\nWhat is the meaning of the sum of two angular momentum operators and what are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions\nof the resulting operators?\n4.2.4 Addition of angular momentum\nWe have seen above that any elementary particle posses an intrinsic spin. Then, we can always define the total angular\nmomentum as the sum of the orbital angular momentum and the intrinsic spin. This is an example of addition of\nangular momentum. Then of course we could also consider two distinct particles and ask what is the total orbital\nangular momentum of the two particles (or of more particles). There are thus many cases of addition of angular\nmomentum, for example:\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nx\nx\nx\n1. J = L + S\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\n\n~\n~\nL\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n2. Lx = Lx 1 + Lx 2\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n3. J = J1 + J2 = L1 + S1 + L2 + S2\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n4. Sx = Sx1 + Sx2 + Sx3\n5. . . .\nConsider for example the second case. A possible state of the two particles can be described by the eigenval\nues/eigenfunctions of each particle angular momentum. For example we could specify l1 and m\nas well as l2 and\nz\nm (I will from now on just write m1 for m etc.). Then a state could be for example written in Dirac's notation as\nz\nz\n|l1, m1, l2, m2). This however does not tell us anything about the total system and its angular momentum. Sometime\nthis quantity is more interesting (for example if the two particles are interacting, their total angular momentum is\nbound to determine their energy, and not the state of each particle alone).\nA. Coupled and uncoupled representations\nThe sum of angular momentum satisfy the general commutation rules, [L2, Lz ] = 0, [Lx, Ly] = i Lz etc. We can then\nx\nalso define the eigenvalues (and eigenfunctions) of the total angular momentum Lˆ, for example l (for L2) and m (for\nLz ). However, since we only have 2 quantum numbers, we expect the eigenfunctions to be degenerate and we still\nneed to find two more quantum numbers. Equivalently, what we need to do is to find a complete set of commuting\nobservables, such that an eigenfunction (common to all these observables) is well defined -no ambiguity in it- by the\nset of eigenvalues (or quantum numbers) of the observables.\nThe first question we can ask is : are these eigenfunctions going to be in common with the single particle operators?\nTo determine this, we need to look at the commutation of the operators.\nNow we know that [L2\n1, Lz,1] = 0, but what about [L2, Lz,1]?\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nx\nx\nx\nx\nWe first express L2 explicitly: L2 = |L1 + L2|2 = L1\n2 + L2\n2 + 2L1 · L2. Then the commutator is:\n[L2, Lz,1] = [L2\n1 + L2\n2 + 2(Lx,1Lx,2 + Ly,1Ly,2 + L1L2), Lz,1]\nz\nz\n= [2(Lx,1Lx,2 + Ly,1Ly,2), Lz,1] = 2i ((Ly,1Lx,2 - Lx,1Ly,2) 6= 0\nThus the two operators do not commute and do not share common eigenfunctions. What about L2\n1?\n[L2, L1\n2] = [L2\n1 + L2\n2 + 2(Lx,1Lx,2 + Ly,1Ly,2 + L1L2), L1\n2] = 0\nz\nz\nsince [L2\n1, La,1] = 0. This means that there are common eigenfunctions of L1\n2 , L2\n2, L2 and Lz . These operators are a\ncomplete set of commuting observables. An eigenfunction is thus well defined by the set of eigenvalues l, m, l1 and l2\nand we can write the eigenstates as ψl,m,l1,l2 or |l, m, l1, l2).\nThere are then two possible representations of the combined system (two possible basis to represent a general state):\nRepresentation\nEigenstates\nComplete set of commuting observables\nUncoupled\n|l1, m1, l2, m2),\nL1\n2 , L2\n2, L1,z and L2,z\nCoupled\n|l, m, l1, l2),\nL1\n2 , L2\n2 , L2 and Lz .\nHow do we go from one basis to the other? As usual this is done by expressing each vector in one basis as a linear\ncombination of vectors in the other basis:\nl\n|l, m, l1, l2) =\nc\n|l1, m1, l2, m2)\nm1,m2\nm1,m2\nNotice that since the total angular momentum in the z direction must be m, we limit the sum to terms s.t. m1+m2 =\nm.\nl\nWhat are the coefficients c\n?\nm1,m2\n′\n′\nSince the two representations are two orthogonal basis, we have that (l1\n′ , m 1, l 2\n′ , m 2|l1, m1, l2, m2) = 0 unless all the\nindexes are equal. Then the coefficient can be calculated (as usual!) from the inner product of |l1, m1, l2, m2) and\n|l, m, l1, l2):\nl\nc\n= (l1, m1, l2, m2|l, m, l1, l2)\nm1,m2\nThese coefficients are called the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients.\n\n~\n~\nB. Addition rules: Two particles\nIn describing the energy levels of atoms and nuclei it is very convenient to be able to find the allowed values of\n(l, m) given the values of (l1, l2) for two given particles (e.g. electrons, protons or neutrons). Indeed, we saw that the\noperator Lˆ2 appears in the Hamiltonian of the system. Thus its eigenvalue\n2l(l +1) will be important in determining\nthe system energy.\nEven if we cannot fix the value of l if we only know l1, m1, l2 and m2 we can at least restrict the possible values\nof l. In order to do so, one has to analyze the possible maximum length of the total angular momentum and the\ndegeneracy of the eigenvalues.\n1) Maximum l: For two particles with quantum numbers l1 and l2 we know that in the coupled representation\nwe cannot fix the values of m1 and m2. However, we know that given l1 and l2 only some values of m1 and m2 are\nallowed (e.g. m1 = -l1, -l1 + 1, . . . , l1). Then the maximum values of m1 and m2 are m1 = l1 and m2 = l2. This\nalso determines the maximum value of m: mmax = l1 + l2. But m itself can only take values m = -l, . . . , l - 1, l.\nThen the maximum value of l is mmax = lmax.\nThus, what we just proved is that l ≤ l1 + l2.\n2) Minimum l: To find the minimum l value we need to look at the degeneracy of the state |l, m, l1, l2). Since this\nL\nl\nstate could be also written (in the uncoupled representation) as\nc\n|l1, m1, l2, m2), the degeneracy of\nm1,m2\nm1+m2=m\nthe state must be the same. What are the two degeneracies?\nWe know that for a given angular momentum operator Lˆ with total angular momentum quantum number l, there\nare 2l + 1 states with the same angular momentum\n2l(l + 1).\nThen, considering the uncoupled representation we have D = (2l1 + 1)(2l2 + 1) possible states with l1 and l2.\nLl1 +l2\nIn the coupled representation instead we have to consider all the states that have an allowed l: D =\n(2l + 1).\nl=lmin\nLK\nK(K+1)\nWe want these two quantities to be equal. Now remember that\nk =\n. Then Ll1 +l2 (2l + 1) = (1 + l1 +\nk=1\nl=lmin\nl2)2 - l2\n, so that l2\n= (1 + l1 + l2)2 - (2l1 + 1)(2l2 + 1) = (l1 - l2)2 .\nmin\nmin\nUsing the degeneracy condition we thus proved that l ≥|l1 - l2|.\nThe addition rule states thus that\nThe total angular momentum quantum number is bounded by |l1-l2| ≤ l ≤ l1+l2\n\nExample: Consider two spins-1/2 particles (for example two electrons with zero orbital angular momentum).

The possible values for s are 1 or 0. In the first case, we have 3 possible\nvalues for m = -1, 0, 1. While the second only has m = 0.

Addition rules: many particles\nThe addition rules can be generalized to many particles, by just repetitively applying the two-particle rules.

Angular Equation\nThe angular equation was found to be:\n(\n)\n∂\n∂Y m(θ, φ)\n∂2Y m(θ, φ)\nl\nl\nsin θ\n+\n= -l(l + 1)Y m(θ, φ)\nl\nsin θ ∂θ\n∂θ\nsin2 θ\n∂φ2\nNotice that this equation does not depend at all on the potential, thus it will be common to all problems with an\nisotropic potential.\nWe can solve the equation by using again separation of variables: Y (θ, φ) = Θ(θ)Φ(φ). By multiplying both sides of\nthe equation by sin2(θ)/Y (θ, φ) we obtain:\n[\n(\n)]\nd\nd Θ\nd 2Φ\nsin θ\nsin θ\n+ l(l + 1) sin2 θ = -\nΘ(θ)\nd θ\nd θ\nΦ(φ) d φ2\nAs usual we separate the two equations in the different variables and introduce a constant C = m :\nd 2Φ = -m 2Φ(φ)\nd φ2\n(\n)\nd\nd Θ\n[\n]\nsin θ\nsin θ\n= m 2 - l(l + 1) sin2 θ Θ(θ)\nd θ\nd θ\nThe first equation is easily solved to give Φ(φ) = eimφ with m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . since we need to impose the periodicity\nof Φ, such that Φ(φ + 2π) = Φ(φ).\nThe solutions to the second equations are associated Legendre Polynomials: Θ(θ) = AP m(cos θ), the first few of\nl\nwhich are in table 1. Notice that, as previously found when solving for the eigenvalues of the angular momentum,\nwe have that m = -l, -l + 1, . . . , l, with l = 0, 1, . . . .\nl\\m\nP 0\n0 = 1\nP 0\n1 = cos θ\nP 0\n2 = 1\n2(3 cos2 θ - 1)\nP 0\n3 = 1\n2(5 cos3 θ - 3 cos θ)\nP 1\n1 = sin θ\nP 1\n2 = 3 cos θ sin θ\nP 1\n3 = 3\n2(5 cos2 θ - 1) sin θ\nP 2\n2 = 3 sin2 θ\nP 2\n3 = 15 cos θ sin2 θ P 3\n3 = 15 sin3 θ\nTable 1: Legendre Polynomials\nThe normalized angular eigenfunctions are then Spherical Harmonic functions, given by the normalized Legendre\npolynomial times the solution to the equation in φ, (see also Table 2)\n\n(2l + 1) (l - m)!\nY m\nP m\nimφ\n(θ, φ) =\n(cos θ) e\nl\nl\n4π\n(l + m)!\nAs we expect from eigenfunctions, the Spherical Harmonics are orthogonal:\ndΩ Y m(θ, φ)Y m ′ (θ, φ) =\n′\nl\nl′\nδl,l′ δm,m\n4π\nE.

Then the equation reduces to:\n[\n]\nd 2u\nl(l + 1)\n-\n+ V +\nu(r) = Eu(r)\n2m d r2\n2m\nr2\nThis equation is very similar to the Schr odinger equation in 1D if we define an effective potential V ′ (r) = V (r) +\nr2 . The second term in this effective potential is called the centrifugal term.\nl(l+1)\n2m\nSolutions can be found for some forms of the potential V (r), by first calculating the equation solutions un,l(r), then\nfinding Rn,l(r) = un,l(r)/r and finally the wavefunction\nΨn,l,m(r, θ, φ) = Rn,l(r)Yl\nm(θ, φ).\nNotice that we need 3 quantum numbers (n, l, m) to define the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian in 3D.\nFor example we can have a simple spherical well: V (r) = 0 for r < r0 and V (r) = V0 otherwise. In the case of l = 0,\nthis is the same equation as for the square well in 1D. Notice however that since the boundary conditions need to be\nsuch that R(r) is finite for all r, we need to impose that u(r = 0) = 0, hence only the odd solutions are acceptable\n(as we had anticipated). For l > 0 we can find solutions in terms of Bessel functions\nr\nTwo other important examples of potential are the harmonic oscillator potential V (r) = V0\n2 - V0 (which is an\nr0\napproximation for any potential close to its minimum) and the Coulomb potential V (r) = - e\n1, which describes\n4πo0 r\nthe atomic potential and in particular the Hydrogen atom.\n4.3.1 The Hydrogen atom\nWe want to solve the radial equation for the Coulomb potential, or at least find the eigenvalues of the equation.\nNotice we are looking for bound states, thus the total energy is negative E < 0. Then we define the real quantity\nI\n-2mE\nκ =\n, and the quantities8:\n4πo0\nBohr radius:\na0 =\n,\nRydberg constant:\nR =\nmee2\n2ma0\nR\nand λ2 =\n. The values of the two constants are a0 = 5.29 × 10-11m and R = 13.6 eV (thus λ is a dimensionless\n|E|\nparameter). The Bohr radius gives the distance at which the kinetic energy of an electron (classically) orbiting\ne 2\naround the nucleus equals the Coulomb interaction:\nmev =\n. In the semi-classical Bohr model, the angular\n4πo0 r\nmomentum L = mevr is quantized, with lowest value L =\n, then by inserting in the equation above, we find r = a0.\nWe will see that the Rydberg energy gives instead the minimum energy for the hydrogen.\nWe further apply a change of variable ρ = 2κr, and we rewrite the radial equation as:\n]\n[ 1\n=\nd 2u\nλ\nl(l + 1)\n-\n+\nu(ρ)\nd ρ2\nρ\nρ2\nThere are two limiting cases:\nl(l+1)\nFor ρ → 0, the equation reduces to d u\n2 =\nu, with solution u(ρ) ∼ ρl+1 .\nd ρ2\nρ2\nu(ρ)\n-ρ/2\nFor ρ →inf we have d u\n2 =\n, giving u(ρ) ∼ e\n.\nd ρ2\n8 Note that the definition of the Bohr radius is slightly different if the Coulomb potential is not expressed in SI units but in cgs\nunits\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\n\n~\n~\nA general solution can then be written as u(ρ) = e-ρ/2ρl+1S(ρ) (with S to be determined). We then expand S(ρ)\nLinf\n-ρ/2ρl+1 Linf\nin series as S(ρ) =\nj=0 sj ρj and try to find the coefficients sj . By inserting u(ρ) = e\nj=0 sj ρj in the\nequation we have:\n[\n]\nd 2\nd\nρ\n+ (2l + 2 - ρ)\n- (l + 1 - λ) S(ρ) = 0\nd ρ2\nd ρ\nFrom which we obtain:\nL [\nρ {j(j + 1)sj+1ρj-1} + (2l + 2 - ρ){(j + 1)sj+1ρj } - (l + 1 - λ){sj ρj }\n]\n= 0\nj\n(where the terms in brackets correspond to the derivatives of S(ρ)). This equation defines a recursive equation for\nthe coefficients sj :\nj + l + 1 - λ\nsj+1 =\nsj\nj(j + 1) + (2l + 2)(j + 1)\nIf we want the function u(ρ) to be well defined, we must impose that u(ρ) → 0 for ρ →inf. This imposes a maximum\nvalue for j, jmax, such that all the higher coefficients sj>jmax are zero.\nWe thus impose that sjmax+1 = 0, setting the numerator of the formula above to zero.\nThen we have that jmax +l+1-λ = 0. But this is an equation for λ, which in turns determines the energy eigenvalue:\nλ = jmax + l + 1.\nWe then rename the parameter λ the principal quantum number n, since it is an integer (as j and l are integers).\nThen the energy is given by E = - n\nR\n2 and the allowed energies are given by the famous Bohr formula:\nEn = - 1\nn2\nme\n2 2\n( e2\n4πo0\n)2\nObs.: Note that the energy is only determined by the principal quantum number. What is the degeneracy of the n\nquantum number? We know that the full eigenfunction is specified by knowing the angular momentum L2 and one\nof its components (e.g. Lz). From the equation above, n = jmax + l + 1, we see that for each n, l can vary from l = 0\nto l = n - 1. Then we also have 2l + 1 m values for each l (and 2 spin states for each m). Finally, the degeneracy is\nthen given by\nn-1\nL\n2(2l + 1) = 2n\nl=0\n4.3.2 Atomic periodic structure\nWe calculated the energy levels for the Hydrogen atom. This will give us spectroscopy information about the excited\nstates that we can excite using, for example, laser light. How can we use this information to infer the structure of\nthe atoms?\nA neutral atom, of atomic number Z, consists of a heavy nucleus, with electric charge Ze, surrounded by Z electrons\n(mass m and charge -e). The Hamiltonian for this system is\nZ [\n]\nZ\nL\nZe2\nL\ne\n∇2\nH =\n-\n+\n2m\nj - 4πo0 rj\n2 4πo0\n|xrj - xrk|\nj=1\nj6=k\nThe first term is simply the kinetic energy of each electron in the atom. The second term is the potential energy of\nthe jth electron in the electric field created by the nucleus. Finally the last sum (which runs over all values of j and k\nexcept j = k) is the potential energy associated with the mutual repulsion of the electrons (the factor of 1/2 in front\ncorrects for the fact that the summation counts each pair twice).\nGiven this Hamiltonian, we want to find the energy levels (and in particular the ground state, which will give us the\nstable atomic configuration). We then need to solve Schr odinger 's equation. But what would an eigenstate of this\nequation now be?\nConsider for example Helium, an atom with only two electrons. Neglecting for the moment spin, we can write\nthe wavefunction as Ψ(xr1, xr2, t) (and stationary wavefunctions, ψ(xr1, xr2)), that is, we have a function of the spatial\ncoordinates of both electrons. The physical interpretation of the wavefunction is a simple extension of the one-particle\nwavefunction: |ψ(xr1, xr2)|2d3xr1d3xr2 is the probability of finding contemporaneously the two electrons at the positions\nħ\nħ\n\n~\n~\nJ\nxr1 and xr2, respectively. The wavefunction must then be normalized as\n|ψ(xr1, xr2)|2d3xr1d3xr2 = 1. The generalization\nto many electrons (or more generally to many particles) is then evident.\nTo determine the ground state of an atom we will then have to solve the Schr odinger equation\nHψ(xr1, . . . , xrZ ) = Eψ(xr1, . . . , xrZ )\nThis equation has not been solved (yet) except for the case Z=1 of the Hydrogen atom we saw earlier. What we can\ndo is to make a very crude approximation and ignore the Coulomb repulsion among electrons. Mathematically this\nsimplifies tremendously the equation, since now we can simply use separation of variables to write many equations\nfor each independent electron. Physically, this is often a good enough approximation because mutual repulsion of\nelectron is not as strong as the attraction from all the protons. Then the Schr odinger equation becomes:\nZ [\n]\nL\nZe2\n∇2\n-\nψ(xr1, . . . , xrZ ) = Eψ(xr1, . . . , xrZ )\nj -\n2m\n4πo0 rj\nj=1\nand we can write ψ(xr1, . . . , xrZ ) = ψ(xr1)ψ(xr2) . . . ψ(xrZ )\nThen, we can solve for each electron separately, as we did for the Hydrogen atom equation, and find for each electron\nZe2\nthe same level structure as for the Hydrogen, except that the since the potential energy is now 4πo0\nthe electron\nrj\nenergy (Bohr's formula) is now multiplied by Z. The solutions to the time-independent Schr odinger equations are\nthen the same eigenfunctions we found for the hydrogen atom, ψ(xrj = ψlmn(r, θ, φ).\nThus if we ignore the mutual repulsion among electrons, the individual electrons occupy one-particle hydrogenic\nstates (n, l, m), called orbitals, in the Coulomb potential of a nucleus with charge Ze.\nThere are 2n2 hydrogenic wave functions (all with the same energy En) for a given value of n. Looking at the Periodic\nTable we see this periodicity, with two elements in the n = 1 shell, 8 in the n = 2 shell, 18 in the third shell. Higher\nshells however are more influenced by the electron-electron repulsion that we ignored, thus simple considerations\nfrom this model are no longer valid.\nHowever, we would expect instead the electrons in the atoms to occupy the state with lowest energy. The ground\nstate would then be a situation were all the electron occupy their own ground state (n = 0, l = 0, m = 0). But is this\ncorrect? This is not what is observed in nature, otherwise all the atom would show the same chemical properties. So\nwhat happens?\nTo understand, we need to analyze the statistical properties of identical particles. But before that, we will intro\nr\nduce the solution for another central potential, the harmonic oscillator potential V (r) = V0 r\n0 - V0 (which is an\napproximation for any potential close to its minimum).\n4.3.3 The Harmonic Oscillator Potential\nThe quantum h.o. is a model that describes systems with a characteristic energy spectrum, given by a ladder of\nevenly spaced energy levels. The energy difference between two consecutive levels is ΔE. The number of levels is\ninfinite, but there must exist a minimum energy, since the energy must always be positive. Given this spectrum, we\nexpect the Hamiltonian will have the form\n(\n)\nH |n) =\nn +\nω |n) ,\nwhere each level in the ladder is identified by a number n. The name of the model is due to the analogy with\ncharacteristics of classical h.o., which we will review first.\nA. Classical harmonic oscillator and h.o. model\nr\nA classical h.o. is described by a potential energy V =\nkx2 (the radial potential considered above, V (r) =\nV0 r\n0 -V0,\nhas this form). If the system has a finite energy E, the motion is bound by two values ±x0, such that V (x0) = E.\nThe equation of motion is given by\n{ d x\np(t)\nd 2x\n=\nd t\nm ,\n→\nm\n= -kx,\nd p\nd t = -kx\nd x2\nand the kinetic energy is of course\np\nT =\nmx\n=\n.\n2m\nħ\n\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\nThe energy is constant since it is a conservative system, with no dissipation. Most of the time the particle is in the\nposition x0 since there the velocity is zero, while at x = 0 the velocity is maximum.\nThe h.o. oscillator in QM is an important model that describes many different physical situations. It describes e.g.\nthe electromagnetic field, vibrations of solid-state crystals and (a simplified model of) the nuclear potential. This is\nbecause any potential with a local minimum can be locally described by an h.o.. Provided that the energy is low\nenough (or x close to x0), any potential can in fact be expanded in series, giving: V (x) ≈ V (x0) + b(x - x0)2 + . . .\nd2V\nwhere b =\n|x0 .\ndx2\nIt is easy to solve the equation of motion. Instead of just solving the usual equation, we follow a slightly different\nroute. We define dimensionless variables,\np\n√\nP = √\n,\nX = x mω,\nmω\n/\nwhere we defined a parameter with units of frequency: ω =\nk/m and we introduce a complex classical variable\n(following Roy J. Glauber -Phys. Rev. 131, 2766-2788 (1963))\nα = √ (X + iP ).\nThe classical equations of motion for x and p define the evolution of the variable α:\n{ d x\np(t) ,\ndα\n=\nd t\nm\n→\n= -iωα(t)\nd p = -kx\ndt\nd t\n-iωt\nThe evolution of α is therefore just a rotation in its phase space: α(t) = α(0)e\n.\n√\n√\nSince X =\n2Re(α) and P =\n2Im(α), X and P oscillate, as usual in the classical case:\n-iωt + α∗ iωt)\nX = √ (α0e\n0e\n√\n-i\n-iωt - α∗ iωt)\nP =\n(α0e\n0e\nThe classical energy, given by ω/2(X2 + P 2) = ωα0\n2, is constant at all time.\nB. Oscillator Hamiltonian: Position and momentum operators\nUsing the operators associated with position and momentum, the Hamiltonian of the quantum h.o. is written as:\np\nkx2\np\nH =\n+\n=\n+\nmω2 x .\n2m\n2m\nω\nIn terms of the dimensionless variables, P and X, the Hamiltonian is H = 2 (X2 + P 2).\nIn analogy with the classical variable a(t) [and its complex conjugate a ∗(t), which simplified the equation of motion, we\nintroduce two operators, a, a+, hoping to simplify the eigenvalue equation (time-independent Schr odinger equation):\n√\n√i\na = √1\n√1\n(X + iP ) =\n(\nmωx +\np)\nmω\n√\n+\n√1\n√1\n√i\na =\n(X - iP ) =\n(\nmωx -\np),\nmω\n+\nAlso, we define the number operator as N = a a, with eigenvalues n and eigenfunctions |n). The Hamiltonian can be\nwritten in terms of these operators. We substitute a, a+ at the place of X and P , yielding H =\nω(a a+\n+\n1) =\nω(N + 1)\nand the minimum energy\nω/2 is called the zero point energy.\nThe commutation properties are:\n[\na, a+]\n= 1 and [N, a] = -a,\n[\nN, a+]\n= a+. Also we have:\nI\n+\nx =\n(a + a)\n2mω\nI\nmω1\np = i\n(a+ - a)\nProve the commutation relationships of the raising and lowering operators.\n+\ni\ni\n[a, a ] =\n[X + iP, X -iP ] =\n([X, -iP ] + [iP, X]) = -\n[X, P ] = -\n[x, p] = 1\n+\n+\n+\nSo we also have aa = [a, a +] + a a = 1 + a a = 1 + N.\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n[N, a] = [a a, a] = [a , a]a = -a and\n[N, a ] = [a a, a ] = a [a, a ] = a\nħ\nħ\nħ\nħ\n\nFrom the commutation relationships we have:\na |n) = [a, N] |n) = an |n) - Na |n) → N(a |n)) = (n - 1)(a |n)),\nthat is, a |n) is also an eigenvector of the N operator, with eigenvalue (n - 1). Thus we confirm that this is the\nlowering operator: a |n) = cn |n - 1). Similarly, a+ |n) is an eigenvector of N with eigenvalue n + 1:\n[\n+\na + |n) = N, a+]\n|n) = Na+ |n) - a n |n) → N(a + |n)) = (n + 1)(a |n)).\nWe thus have a |n) = cn |n - 1) and a+ |n) = dn |n + 1). What are the coefficients cn, dn?\nSince\n+\n(n| N |n) = (n| a a |n) = n\nand\n+\n(n| a a |n) = ((an|)(a |n)) = (n - 1|n - 1)c ,\nn\n√\n+\nwe must have cn =\nn. Analogously, since aa = N + 1, as seen from the commutation relationship:\nd2\n+\n+\n(n + 1|n + 1) = (a n|a n) = (n| aa + |n) (n| (N + 1) |n) = n + 1\nn\nSo in the end we have :\n√\n√\na |n) =\nn |n - 1) ;\na + |n) =\nn + 1 |n + 1) .\nAll the n eigenvalues of N have to be non-negative since n = (n| N |n) = (ψn1 |ψn1 ) ≥ 0 (this follows from the\nproperties of the inner product and the fact that |ψn1 ) = a |n) is just a regular state vector). However, if we apply\nover and over the a (lowering) operator, we could arrive at negative numbers n: we therefore require that a |0) = 0\n+\nto truncate this process. The action of the raising operator a can then produce any eigenstate, starting from the 0\neigenstate:\n+)n\n(a\n|n) = √\n|0) .\nn!\nThe matrix representation of these operator in the |n) basis (with infinite-dimensional matrices) is particularly simple,\n√\n√\nsince (n| a |n ′ ) = δn ′ ,n-1\nn and (n| a+ |n ′ ) = δn ′ ,n+1\nn + 1:\n√\n\n. . .\n. . .\n√\n+\n√\na = 0\n. . . a =\n. . .\n√\n. . .\n. . .\nC.

Since a |0) = 0 we have √1 (X + iP ) |0) = √1 (\nmωx + √\n) |0) = 0.

Notice the different parity for even and\nodd number and the number of zeros of these functions. Classically, the probability that the oscillating particle is at\na given value of x is simply the fraction of time that it spends there, which is inversely proportional to its velocity\nI\nv(x) = x0ω 1 - x\nx\n0 at that position. For large n, the probability distribution becomes close to the classical one (see\nFig. ??).\n9 For more details on Hermite Polynomials and their generator function, look on Cohen-Tannoudji.

The wavefunction is then: ψ(xr1, xr2) and if we assume\nthat there is no interaction between the two particles, we will be able to describe the states using separation of\nvariables:\nψ(xr1, xr2) = ψa(xr1)ψb(xr2)\nwhere a and b label two different single-particle states. Implicit in this expression is the assumption that I can\ndistinguish the two particles by some mean, and link particle one to the position 1 and the state a. However, if we\nconsider two identical particles (2 electrons, two photons, two neutrons) there is no physical mean to distinguish\nthem. Even if we try to measure them in order to keep track of which one is which, we know that in the process we\ndestroy the state (by the wavefunction collapse) so not even this is a possibility.\n4.4.1 Bosons, fermions\nIn quantum mechanics identical particle are fundamentally indistinguishable. Then the expression above does not\ncorrectly describe the state anymore. In order to faithfully describe a state in which we cannot know if particle a or b\nis at r1 or r2, we can take a linear combination of these two possibilities: ψ(xr1, xr2) = A1ψa(xr1)ψb(xr2)+A2ψb(xr1)ψa(xr2).\nNow, since the two possibilities have the same probability, we have |A1| = |A2| = √ . Then there are two possible\ncombinations:\nψ(xr1, xr2) = √ [ψa(xr1)ψb(xr2) ± ψb(xr1)ψa(xr2)]\nThese two combinations describe two types of particle. The combination with the plus sign describes bosons, particles\nthat are invariant under exchange of a particle pair. The combination with the minus sign describes fermions:\n- all particles with integer spin are bosons\n- all particles with half-integer spin are fermions\n(This can be proved in relativistic QM).\n4.4.2 Exchange operator\nWe can define an operator Pˆ that interchanges the two particles:\nˆP [ψ(xr1, xr2)] = ψ(xr2, xr1)\nSince of course Pˆ[Pˆ[ψ(xr1, xr2)]] = ψ(xr1, xr2), we have that Pˆ2 = 1. Then the eigenvalues of Pˆ must be ±1. [If φn\nis an eigenfunction of Pˆ with eigenvalue pn, we have Pˆ2φn = p2φn = φn, from which p2 = 1.] If two particles\nn\nn\nˆ\nare identical, then the Hamiltonian is invariant with respect to their exchange and [H, P ] = 0. Then we can find\nenergy eigenfunctions that are common eigenfunctions of the exchange operator, or ψ(xr1, xr2) = ±ψ(xr2, xr1). Then if\nthe system is initially in such a state, it will be always be in a state with the same exchange symmetry. For the\nconsiderations above, however, we have seen that the wavefunction is not only allowed, but it must be in a state with\na definite symmetry:\n{\nψ(xr2, xr1)\nbosons\nψ(xr1, xr2) =\n-ψ(xr2, xr1)\nfermions\n4.4.3 Pauli exclusion principle\nFrom the form of the allowed wavefunction for fermions, it follows that two fermions cannot occupy the same state.\nAssume that ψa(xr) = ψb(xr), then we always have that\nψf (xr1, xr2) = √ [ψa(xr1)ψb(xr2) - ψb(xr1)ψa(xr2)] = 0.\nThis is the well-known Pauli exclusion principle. Notice that of course it applies to any fermions. For example, it\napplies to electrons, and this is the reason why electrons do not pile up in the lowest energy level of the atomic\nstructure, but form a shell model. We will see that the same applies as well to protons and neutrons, giving rise to\nthe shell model for nuclei.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

This in turns will give us insight on the energies\nand forces that bound nuclei together and thus of the phenomena (that we'll study later on) that can break them\napart or create them.\nIn order to study the nuclear structure we need to know the constituents of nuclei (the nucleons, that is, protons\nand neutrons) and treat them as QM objects. From the point of view of QM as we studied until now, we want first\nto know what is the state of the system (at equilibrium). Thus we want to solve the time-independent Schr odinger\nequation. This will give us the energy levels of the nuclei.\nThe exact nature of the forces that keep together the nucleus constituents are the study of quantum chromodynamics,\nthat describes and look for the source of the strong interaction, one of the four fundamental interactions, along with\ngravitation, the electromagnetic force and the weak interaction. This theory is well-beyond this course. Here we want\nonly to point out some of the properties of the nucleon-nucleon interaction:\n- At short distances is stronger than the Coulomb force: we know that nuclei comprise tightly packed protons, thus\nto keep these protons together the nuclear force has to beat the Coulomb repulsion.\n- The nuclear force is short range. This is supported by the fact that interactions among e.g. two nuclei in a molecule\nare only dictated by the Coulomb force and no longer by the nuclear force.\n- Not all the particles are subjected to the nuclear force (a notable exception are electrons)\n- The nuclear force does not depend at all on the particle charge, e.g. it is the same for protons and neutrons.\n- The nuclear force does depend on spin, as we will prove in the case of the deuteron.\n- Experiments can reveal other properties, such as the fact that there is a repulsive term at very short distances and\nthat there is a component that is angular-dependent (the force is then not central and angular momentum is not\nconserved, although we can neglect this to a first approximation).\nWe will first see how these characteristics are reflected into the Hamiltonian of the simplest (non-trivial) nucleus, the\ndeuteron. This is the only nucleus that we can attempt to solve analytically by forming a full model of the interaction\nbetween two nucleons. Comparing the model prediction with experimental results, we can verify if the characteristics\nof the nuclear force we described are correct. We will then later study how the nuclear force properties shape the\nnature and composition of stable and unstable nuclei.\n\n5.2 The Deuteron\n5.2.1 Reduced Hamiltonian in the center-of-mass frame\nWe start with the simplest problem, a nucleus formed by just one neutron and one proton: the deuteron. We will at\nfirst neglect the spins of these two particles and solve the energy eigenvalue problem (time-independent Schr odinger\nequation) for a bound p-n system. The Hamiltonian is then given by the kinetic energy of the proton and the neutron\nand by their mutual interaction.\nH =\npˆn +\npˆp + Vnuc(|xp - xn|)\n2mn\n2mp\nHere we stated that the interaction depends only on the distance between the two particles (and not for example the\nangle...)\nWe could try to solve the Schr odinger equation for the wavefunction Ψ = Ψ(Rxp, Rxn, t). This is a wavefunction that\ntreats the two particles as fundamentally independent (that is, described by independent variables). However, since\nthe two particles are interacting, it might be better to consider them as one single system. Then we can use a different\ntype of variables (position and momentum).\nWe can make the transformation from {Rxp, Rxn} →{R, Rr} where R describes the average position of the two particles\n(i.e. the position of the total system, to be accurately defined) and Rr describes the relative position of one particle\nwrt the other:\n\nmp xp+mnx n\nRR =\ncenter of mass\nmp+mn\nRr = Rxp - Rxn\nrelative position\nWe can also invert these equations and define Rxp = xp(R, Rr) and Rxn = xn(R, Rr). Also, we can define the center of\nmass momentum and relative momentum (and velocity):\n\npRcm = pRp + pRn\npRr = (mnpRp - mppRn)/M\nThen the (classical) Hamiltonian, using these variables, reads\nH =\np 2\n+\ncm\npr + Vnuc(|r|)\n2M\n2μ\nwhere M = mp + mn and μ =\nmpmn\nis the reduced mass. Now we can just write the quantum version of this\nmp+mn\nclassical Hamiltonian, using\n∂\n∂\npˆcm = -ir\npˆr = -ir\n∂R\n∂Rr\nin the equation\nH =\npˆ\n+\npˆ + Vnuc(|rˆ|)\ncm\nr\n2M\n2μ\nNow, since the variables r and R are independent (same as rp and rn) they commute. This is also true for pcm and r\n(and pr and R). Then, pcm commutes with the whole Hamiltonian, [Rpˆcm, H] = 0. This implies that Rpˆcm is a constant\nof the motion. This is also true for Ecm =\n1 ˆ2\nR\n, the energy of the center of mass. If we solve the problem in the\np\n2M cm\ncenter-of-mass frame, then we can set Ecm = 0 and this is not ever going to change. In general, it means that we can\nignore the first term in the Hamiltonian and just solve\nr2\nHD = -\n∇r\n2 + Vnuc(|Rr|)\n2μ\nIn practice, this corresponds to having applied separation of variables to the original total Schr odinger equation.\nThe Hamiltonian HD (the deuteron Hamiltonian) is now the Hamiltonian of a single-particle system, describing the\nmotion of a reduced mass particle in a central potential (a potential that only depends on the distance from the\norigin). This motion is the motion of a neutron and a proton relative to each other. In order to proceed further we\nneed to know the shape of the central potential.\n\n\"\n#\n5.2.2 Ground state\nWhat are the most important characteristics of the nuclear potential? It is\nknown to be very strong and short range. These are the only characteristics\nthat are of interest now; also, if we limit ourselves to these characteristics and\nbuild a simple, fictitious potential based on those, we can hope to be able to\nsolve exactly the problem.\nIf we looked at a more complex, albeit more realistic, potential, then most\nprobably we cannot find an exact solution and would have to simplify the\nproblem. Thus, we just take a very simple potential, a nuclear square well of\nV(r)\nr\n-V0 =-35MeV\nR0 = 2.1fm\nE0=-2.2MeV\nrange R0 ≈ 2.1fm and of depth -V0 = -35MeV .\nWe need to write the Hamiltonian in spherical coordinates (for the reduced\nFig. 31: Nuclear potential\nvariables). The kinetic energy term is given by:\n(\n)\n\n(\n)\n∂2\n(\n)\nL2\nr\nr 1 ∂\n∂\nr\n∂\n∂\nr 1 ∂\n∂\nˆ\n-\n∇2 = -\nr\n-\nsin θ\n+\n= -\nr\n+\nr\n2μ\n2μ r2 ∂r\n∂r\n2μr2\nsin θ ∂θ\n∂θ\nsin2 θ ∂φ2\n2μ r2 ∂r\n∂r\n2μr2\nwhere we used the angular momentum operator (for the reduced particle) Lˆ2 .\nThe Schr odinger equation then reads\n(\n)\nr 1 ∂\n2 ∂\nLˆ2\n-\nr\n+\n+ Vnuc(r) Ψn,l,m(r, θ, φ) = EnΨn,l,m(r, θ, φ)\n2μ r2 ∂r\n∂r\n2μr2\nWe can now also check that [Lˆ2 , H] = 0. Then Lˆ2 is a constant of the motion and it has common eigenfunctions with\nthe Hamiltonian.\nWe have already solved the eigenvalue problem for the angular momentum. We know that solutions are the spherical\nharmonics Y m(θ, φ):\nl\nLˆ2Y m(θ, φ) = r 2l(l + 1)Y m(θ, φ)\nl\nl\nThen we can solve the Hamiltonian above with the separation of variables methods, or more simply look for a solution\nΨn,l,m = ψn,l(r)Y m(θ, φ):\nl\nr 2 1 ∂ (\n2 ∂ψn,l(r))\nY m\nLˆ2[Yl\nm(θ, φ)]\n-\nr\n(θ, φ) + ψn,l(r)\n= [En - Vnuc(r)]ψn,l(r)Y m(θ, φ)\nr2\nl\nl\n2μ\n∂r\n∂r\n2μr2\nusing the eigenvalue equation above we have\n\n(\n)\nY m\n\nr 1 ∂\n2 ∂ψn,l(r)\nY m\n\nr 2l(l + 1) l\nY m\n\n(θ, φ)\n\n-\nr2\nr\nl\n=\n- Vnuc\nl (θ, φ)\n(θ, φ) + ψn,l(r)\n[En\n(r)]ψn,l(r)\n2μ\n∂r\n∂r\n2μr2\nand then we can eliminate Yl\nm to obtain:\n)\n\nr 2 1 d ( d ψn,l(r)\n\nr 2l(l + 1)\n-\nr\n+ Vnuc(r) +\nψn,l(r) = Enψn,l(r)\n2μ r2 d r\nd r\n2μr2\nNow we write ψn,l(r) = un,l(r)/r. Then the radial part of the Schr odinger equation becomes\n2 d 2\n\nr\nu\nr l(l + 1)\n-\n+ Vnuc(r) +\nu(r) = Eu(r)\n2μ d r2\n2μ\nr2\nwith boundary conditions\nunl(0) = 0\n→ ψ(0) is finite\nunl(inf) = 0\n→ bound state\nThis equation is just a 1D Schr odinger equation in which the potential V (r) is replaced by an effective potential\nr 2l(l + 1)\nVeff (r) = Vnuc(r) +\n2μr2\nthat presents the addition of a centrifugal potential (that causes an outward force).\n\nV(r)\nr\n-V0 =-35MeV\nR0 = 2.1fm\nE0=-2.2MeV\nFig. 32: Nuclear potential for l\n0. Left, nuclear potential and centrifugal potential. Right, the effective potential.\n=\nNotice that if l is large, the centrifugal potential is higher. The ground state is then found for l = 0. In that case\nthere is no centrifugal potential and we only have a square well potential (that we already solved).\nThis gives the eigenfunctions\nu(r) = A sin(kr) + B cos(kr),\n0 < r < R0\nand\nu(r) = Ce-κr + Deκr ,\nr > R0\nThe allowed eigenfunctions (as determined by the boundary conditions) have eigenvalues found from the odd-parity\nsolutions to the equation\n-κ = k cot(kR0)\nwith\n2μ\n2μ\nκ2\n=\n(E0 + V0)\n= -\nk2\n2 E0\nr\nr\n(with E0 < 0).\nRecall that we found that there was a minimum well depth and range in order to have a bound state. To satisfy the\nπ\nπ\ncontinuity condition at r = R0 we need λ/4 ≤ R0 or kR0 ≥ 1 2π =\n. Then R0 ≥\n2k .\nIn order to find a bound state, we need the potential energy to be higher than the kinetic energy V0 > Ekin. If we\nπ\nknow R0 we can use k ≥\nto find\n2R0\n2π2\nπ2\n2 2\nπ2\nr\nr c\n(191MeV fm)2\nV0 >\n=\n=\n= 23.1MeV\n2μ4R2\n8 μc2R2\n8 469MeV (2.1fm)2\nWe thus find that indeed a bound state is possible, but the binding energy E0 = Ekin - V0 is quite small. Solving\nnumerically the trascendental equation for E0 we find that\nE0 = -2.2MeV\nNotice that in our procedure we started from a model of the potential that includes the range R0 and the strength\nV0 in order to find the ground state energy (or binding energy). Experimentally instead we have to perform the\ninverse process. From scattering experiments it is possible to determine the binding energy (such that the neutron\nand proton get separated) and from that, based on our theoretical model, a value of V0 can be inferred.\n5.2.3 Deuteron excited state\nAre bound excited states for the deuteron possible?\nConsider first l = 0. We saw that the binding energy for the ground state was already small. The next odd solution\n3π\nwould have k =\n= 3k0. Then the kinetic energy is 9 times the ground state kinetic energy or E1\n= 9E0\n=\n2R0\nkin\nkin\n9 × 32.8MeV = 295.2MeV . The total energy thus becomes positive, the indication that the state is no longer bound\n(in fact, we then have no longer a discrete set of solutions, but a continuum of solutions).\nn2l(l+1)\nConsider then l > 0. In this case the potential is increased by an amount\n≥ 18.75MeV (for l = 1). The\n2μR2\npotential thus becomes shallower (and narrower). Thus also in this case the state is no longer bound. The deuteron\nhas only one bound state.\nV(r)\nr\n-V0 =-35MeV\nR0 = 2.1fm\nE0=-2.2MeV\n\n-ħ2\n2μ\nr\n∂2\n∂r + Vnuc(r)\n\nu0(r) = E0u0(r)\n\n5.2.4 Spin dependence of nuclear force\nUntil now we neglected the fact that both neutron and proton possess a spin. The question remains how the spin\ninfluences the interaction between the two particles.\nThe total angular momentum for the deuteron (or in general for a nucleus) is usually denoted by I. Here it is given\nby\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nIR = LR + SRp + SRn\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nFor the bound deuteron state l = 0 and I = Sp + Sn = S. A priori we can have S = 0 or 1 (recall the rules for\nRˆ\naddition of angular momentum, here Sp,n =\n).\nThere are experimental signatures that the nuclear force depends on the spin. In fact the deuteron is only found with\nˆRS = 1 (meaning that this configuration has a lower energy).\nˆ\nˆ\nThe simplest form that a spin-dependent potential could assume is Vspin ∝ SRp · SRn (since we want the potential to\nbe a scalar). The coefficient of proportionality V1(r)/r can have a spatial dependence. Then, we guess the form for\nthe spin-dependent potential to be Vspin = V1(r)/r 2SRˆ\np · SRˆ\nn. What is the potential for the two possible configurations\nof the neutron and proton spins?\nThe configuration are either SRˆ = 1 or SRˆ = 0. Let us write SRˆ2 = rS(S + 1) in terms of the two spins:\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nSR2\nSR2\nSR2\nR\nR\n=\n+\nn + 2Sp · Sn\np\nThe last term is the one we are looking for:\nˆ\nˆ\n1 ˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nR\nSR2 - SR2\nSR2\nSRp · Sn =\n-\np\nn\nˆ\nˆ\nBecause Sˆ2 and SRp\n2 , SR2 commute, we can write an equation for the expectation values wrt eigenfunctions of these\nn\noperators10:\nˆ\n\nr 2\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\nR\nR\nR\nR\nSp · Sn\n= hS, Sp, Sn, Sz | Sp · Sn |S, Sp, Sn, Szi =\n(S(S + 1) - Sp(Sp + 1) - Sn(Sn + 1))\nsince Sp,n = 2, we obtain\n\n)\n)\n2 (\nˆ\nˆ\nr\n+ n\nTriplet State,\n= 1, 1 1 , mz\nS\n2 2\nSRp · SRn\n=\nS(S + 1) -\n=\n- 3n\n\nS\n2, 1\n2, 0\n)\nSinglet State,\n= 0,\nIf V1(r) is an attractive potential (< 0), the total potential is Vnuc|S=1 = VT = V0 +\nV1 for a triplet state, while its\nstrength is reduced to Vnuc|S=0 = VS = V0 - 4\n3V1 for a singlet state. How large is V1?\nWe can compute V0 and V1 from knowing the binding energy of the triplet state and the energy of the unbound virtual\nstate of the singlet (since this is very close to zero, it can still be obtained experimentally). We have ET = -2.2MeV\n(as before, since this is the experimental data) and ES = 77keV. Solving the eigenvalue problem for a square well,\nknowing the binding energy ET and setting ES ≈ 0, we obtain VT = -35MeV and VS = -25MeV (Notice that of\ncourse VT is equal to the value we had previously set for the deuteron potential in order to find the correct binding\nenergy of 2.2MeV, we just -wrongly- neglected the spin earlier on). From these values by solving a system of two\nequations in two variables:\nwe obtain V0 = -32.5MeV V1 = -10MeV. Thus the spin-dependent part of the potential is weaker, but not negligible.\n10 Note that of course we use the coupled representation since the properties of the deuteron, and of its spin-dependent energy,\nare set by the common state of proton and neutron\n\nV0 + 1\n4V1 = VT\nV0 -3\n4V1 = VS\n\ni\ni\n5.3 Nuclear models\nIn the case of the simplest nucleus (the deuterium, with 1p-1n) we have been able to solve the time independent\nSchr odinger equation from first principles and find the wavefunction and energy levels of the system --of course with\nsome approximations, simplifying for example the potential. If we try to do the same for larger nuclei, we soon would\nfind some problems, as the number of variables describing position and momentum increases quickly and the math\nproblems become very complex.\nAnother difficulty stems from the fact that the exact nature of the nuclear force is not known, as there's for example\nsome evidence that there exist also 3-body interactions, which have no classical analog and are difficult to study via\nscattering experiments.\nThen, instead of trying to solve the problem exactly, starting from a microscopic description of the nucleus con\nstituents, nuclear scientists developed some models describing the nucleus. These models need to yield results that\nagree with the already known nuclear properties and be able to predict new properties that can be measured in\nexperiments. We are now going to review some of these models.\n5.3.1 Shell structure\nA. The atomic shell model\nYou might already be familiar with the atomic shell model. In the atomic shell model, shells are defined based on\nthe atomic quantum numbers that can be calculated from the atomic Coulomb potential (and ensuing the eigenvalue\nequation) as given by the nuclear's protons.\nShells are filled by electrons in order of increasing energies, such that each orbital (level) can contain at most 2\nelectrons (by the Pauli exclusion principle). The properties of atoms are then mostly determined by electrons in\na non-completely filled shell. This leads to a periodicity of atomic properties, such as the atomic radius and the\nionization energy, that is reflected in the periodic table of the elements. We have seen when solving for the hydrogen\n0.30\n.\n.\n0.25\n.\n.\n.\n.\n..\n....\n.\n.. .\n.\n.\n.\n..\n0.20\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n..\n.\n....\n. .\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n..\n..\n0.15\n.\n.\n..\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n0.10\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n0.05\n..\n.\nZ\nFig. 33: Atomic Radius vs Z.\natom that a quantum state is described by the quantum numbers: |ψ = |n, l, m where n is the principle quantum\nnumber (that in the hydrogen atom was giving the energy). l is the angular momentum quantum number (or azimuthal\nquantum number ) and m the magnetic quantum number. This last one is m = -l, . . . , l - 1, l thus together with\nthe spin quantum number, sets the degeneracy of each orbital (determined by n and l < n) to be D(l) = 2(2l + 1).\nHistorically, the orbitals have been called with the spectroscopic notation as follows:\nRadius Snm'\nl\nSpectroscopi\nnotation\ns\np\nd\nf\nc\ng\nh\ni\nD(l)\nhistoric structure\nheavy nuclei\nThe historical notations come from the description of the observed spectral lines:\ns=sharp\np=principal\nd=diffuse\nf=fine\n\nFig. 34: Ionization energy vs Z.\nOrbitals (or energy eigenfunctions) are then collected into groups of similar energies (and similar properties). The\ndegeneracy of each orbital gives the following (cumulative) occupancy numbers for each one of the energy group:\n2, 10, 18, 36, 54, 70, 86\nNotice that these correspond to the well known groups in the periodic table.\nThere are some difficulties that arise when trying to adapt this model to the nucleus, in particular the fact that the\npotential is not external to the particles, but created by themselves, and the fact that the size of the nucleons is\nmuch larger than the electrons, so that it makes much less sense to speak of orbitals. Also, instead of having just one\ntype of particle (the electron) obeying Pauli's exclusion principle, here matters are complicated because we need to\nfill shells with two types of particles, neutrons and protons.\nIn any case, there are some compelling experimental evidences that point in the direction of a shell model.\nB. Evidence of nuclear shell structure: Two-nucleon separation energy\nThe two-nucleon separation energy (2p- or 2n-separation energy) is the equivalent of the ionization energy for atoms,\nwhere nucleons are taken out in pair to account for a term in the nuclear potential that favor the pairing of nucleons.\nFrom this first set of data we can infer that there exist shells with occupation numbers\n8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126\nThese are called Magic numbers in nuclear physics. Comparing to the size of the atomic shells, we can see that the\natomic magic numbers are quite different from the nuclear ones (as expected since there are two-types of particles\nand other differences.) Only the guiding principle is the same. The atomic shells are determined by solving the energy\neigenvalue equation. We can attempt to do the same for the nucleons.\n5.3.2 Nucleons Hamiltonian\nThe Hamiltonian for the nucleus is a complex many-body Hamiltonian. The potential is the combination of the\nnuclear and coulomb interaction:\nL pˆ\nL\nL\ne\ni\nH =\n+\nVnuc(|Rxi - Rxj |) +\n2mi\n|Rxi - Rxj |\ni\nj,i≤j\nj,i≤j\n\"\nv\n\"\nsum on protons only\nThere is not an external potential as for the electrons (where the protons create a strong external central potential\nfor each electron).

The sudden changes at the magic number are apparent.

These potentials are the effect of all the other nucleons on the nucleon we\nnuc\ncoul\npicked, and only their sum comes into play. The nucleon we focused on is then evolving in the mean field created\nby all the other nucleons. Of course this is a simplification, because the field created by the other nucleons depends\nalso on the jth nucleon, since this nucleon influences (for example) the position of the other nucleons. This kind of\nback-action is ignored in the mean-field approximation, and we considered the mean-field potential as fixed (that is,\ngiven by nucleons with a fixed position).\nWe then want to adopt a model for the mean-field V j\nand V j\n. Let's start with the nuclear potential. We modeled\nnuc\ncoul\nthe interaction between two nucleons by a square well, with depth -V0 and range R0. The range of the nuclear\nwell is related to the nuclear radius, which is known to depend on the nuclear mass number A, as R ∼ 1.25A1/3fm.\nThen V j\nis the sum of many of these square wells, each with a different range (depending on the separation of the\nnuc\nnucleons). The depth is instead almost constant at V0 = 50MeV, when we consider large-A nuclei (this correspond to\n(MeV)\n2p\nS\nPb\n(MeV)\nPt\nHf\nU\nKr\n2n\nCd\nS\nCa\nO\nNucleon number\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n208Pb\n184W\n114Ca\n64Ni\n38Ar\n14C\n132Te\n86Kr\n102Mo\nNi\nCe\nDy\n\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n\"\nv\n≡1 mω2r2\nFig. 36: Potential obtained from the sum of many rectangular potential wells. Black, the potential range increases proportionally\nto the number of nucleons considered. Red, R ∼ A1/3. Blue, harmonic potential, that approximates the desired potential.\nthe average strength of the total nucleon potential). What is the sum of many square wells? The potential smooths\nout. We can approximate this with a parabolic potential. [Notice that for any continuous function, a minimum can\nalways be approximated by a parabolic function, since a minimum is such that the first derivative is zero]. This type\nof potential is useful because we can find an analytical solution that will give us a classification of nuclear states. Of\ncourse, this is a crude approximation. This is the oscillator potential model:\n(\n2 )\nr\nVnuc ≈-V0\n1 - R2\n2 [\nr 2 ]\n(Z-1)e\nNow we need to consider the Coulomb potential for protons. The potential is given by: Vcoul =\n-\nR0\n2R2\nfor r ≤ R0, which is just the potential for a sphere of radius R0 containing a uniform charge (Z - 1)e.\nThen we can write an effective (mean-field, in the parabolic approximation) potential as\n( V0\n(Z - 1)e2 )\n3 (Z - 1)e2\nVeff = r 2\n-\n-V0 +\nR2\n2R3\nR0\n\" \"\nv\n\"\n≡-V0\n′\n(Z-1)e\nWe defined here a modified nuclear square well potential V0\n′ = V0\n2 for protons, which is shallower than for\nR0\nneutrons. Also, we defined the harmonic oscillator frequencies\nThe proton well is thus slightly shallower and wider than the neutron well because of the Coulomb repulsion. This\npotential model has limitations but it does predict the lower magic numbers.\nThe eigenvalues of the potential are given by the sum of the harmonic potential in 3D (as seen in recitation) and the\nsquare well:\n3) - V ′\nEN = rω(N +\n0.\n(where we take V0\n′ = V0 for the neutron).\nNote that solving the equation for the harmonic oscillator potential is not equivalent to solve the full radial equation,\n2 l(l+1)\nwhere the centrifugal term r 2mr2 must be taken into account. We could have solved that total equation and found\nthe energy eigenvalues labeled by the radial and orbital quantum numbers. Comparing the two solutions, we find\nthat the h.o. quantum number N can be expressed in terms of the radial and orbital quantum numbers as\nN = 2(n - 1) + l\nSince l = 0, 1, . . . n - 1 we have the selection rule for l as a function of N: l = N, N - 2, . . . (with l ≥ 0). The\nL\ndegeneracy of the EN eigenvalues is then D ′ (N ) =\n(2l + 1) =\n(N + 1)(N + 2) (ignoring spin) or\nl=N,N-2,...\nD(N) = (N + 1)(N + 2) when including the spin.\nWe can now use these quantum numbers to fill the nuclear levels. Notice that we have separate levels for neutrons\nand protons. Then we can build a table of the levels occupations numbers, which predicts the first 3 magic numbers.\nω2 = 2\nm\n\nV0\nR2\n0 -(Z-1)e2\n2R3\n\n.\n\nq\nN\nl\nSpectroscopic\nNotation\n2D(N)\nD(N)\nCumulative\nof\nnucle\nons#\n1 s\n1 p\n0,2\n1,3\n2s,1d\n2p,1f\n0,2,4\n3s,2d,1g\nFor higher levels there are discrepancies thus we need a more precise model to obtain a more accurate prediction.\nThe other problem with the oscillator model is that it predicts only 4 levels to have lower energy than the 50MeV well\n2n2V0\n(Z-1)e2\npotential (thus only 4 bound energy levels). The separation between oscillator levels is in fact rω =\n-\n≈\nq\nq\nmR0\n2R3\n2n c2V0\n2(200MeV fm)2 ×50MeV\n2R2 . Inserting the numerical values we find rω =\n≈ 51.5A-1/3 Then the separation\nmc\n938MeV (1.25fmA1/3)2\nbetween oscillator levels is on the order of 10-20MeV.\n5.3.3 Spin orbit interaction\nIn order to predict the higher magic numbers, we need to take into account other interactions between the nucleons.\nThe first interaction we analyze is the spin-orbit coupling.\nThe associated potential can be written as\n2 Vso(r)Rˆl · Rsˆ\nr\nR\nwhere Rsˆ and ˆl are spin and angular momentum operators for a single nucleon. This potential is to be added to the\nsingle-nucleon mean-field potential seen before. We have seen previously that in the interaction between two nucleons\nthere was a spin component. This type of interaction motivates the form of the potential above (which again is to\nbe taken in a mean-field picture).\nWe can calculate the dot product with the same trick already used:\nNow recall that both V0 is negative and choose also Vso negative. Then:\n- when the spin is aligned with the angular momentum (j = l +\n) the potential becomes more negative, i.e. the\nwell is deeper and the state more tightly bound.\n- when spin and angular momentum are anti-aligned the system's energy is higher.\nThe energy levels are thus split by the spin-orbit coupling (see figure 37). This splitting is directly proportional to\nn\nthe angular momentum l (is larger for higher l): ΔE =\n(2l + 1). The two states in the same energy configuration\nbut with the spin aligned or anti-aligned are called a doublet.\nExample: Consider the N = 3 h.o. level. The level 1f7/2 is pushed far down (because of the high l). Then its energy\nis so different that it makes a shell on its own. We had found that the occupation number up to N = 2 was 20 (the\n3rd magic number). Then if we take the degeneracy of 1f7/2, D(j) = 2j + 1 = 2 7 + 1 = 8, we obtain the 4th magic\nnumber 28.\n[Notice that since here j already includes the spin, D(j) = 2j + 1 .]\nSince the 1f7/2 level now forms a shell on its own and it does not belong to the N = 3 shell anymore, the residual\ndegeneracy of N = 3 is just 12 instead of 20 as before. To this degeneracy, we might expect to have to add the\nlowest level of the N = 4 manifold. The highest l possible for N = 4 is obtained with n = 1 from the formula\nN = 2(n - 1)+l → l = 4 (this would be 1g). Then the lowest level is for j = l +1/2 = 4+1/2 = 9/2 with degeneracy\nDˆl · ˆs\nE\n= 1\n2(ˆj2 -ˆl2 -ˆs2) = ħ2\n2 [j(j + 1) -l(l + 1) -3]\nˆ\nwhere j is the total angular momentum for the nucleon. Since the spin of the nucleon is s = 1, the possible values\nof j are j = l ± 1\n2. Then j(j + 1) -l(l + 1) = (l ± 1\n2)(l ± 1\n2 + 1) -l(l + 1), and we obtain\nDˆl · ˆs\nE\n=\n(\nl ħ2\nfor j=l+ 1\n-(l + 1) ħ2\nfor j=l- 1\nand the total potential is\nVnuc(r) =\n\nV0 + Vso l\nfor j=l+ 1\nV0 -Vso l+1\nfor j=l- 1\n\n1h\n1g\n2d\n3s\n1f\n2p\n1d\n2s\n1p\n1f7/2\n1p1/2\n2p3/2\n1f5/2\n1d5/2\n2s1/2\n1d3/2\n2p1/2\n1g9/2\n3s1/2\n2f7/2\n1h11/2\n1h9/2\n2d5/2\n2d3/2\n1g7/2\n1f\n2p\n2p1/2\n2p3/2\n1f5/2\n1f7/2\n3N\n2N\nFig. 37: The energy levels from the harmonic oscillator level\n(labeled by N) are first shifted by the angular momentum po\ntential (2p, 1f). Each l level is then split by the spin-orbit in\nteraction, which pushes the energy up or down, depending on\nthe spin and angular momentum alignment\nD = 2(9/2+1) = 10. This new combined shell comprises then 12+10 levels. In turns this gives us the magic number\n50.\nUsing these same considerations, the splittings given by the spin-orbit coupling can account for all the magic numbers\nand even predict a new one at 184:\n- N = 4, 1g → 1g7/2 and 1g9/2. Then we have 20 - 8 = 12 +D(9/2) = 10. From 28 we add another 22 to arrive at\nthe magic number 50.\n- N = 5, 1h → 1h9/2 and 1h11/2. The shell thus combines the N = 4 levels not already included above, and the\nD(1h11/2) = 12 levels obtained from the N = 5 1h11/2. The degeneracy of N = 4 was 30, from which we subtract\nthe 10 levels included in N = 3. Then we have (30 - 10) + D(1h11/2) = 20 + 12 = 32. From 50 we add arrive at\nthe magic number 82.\n- N = 6, 1i → 1i11/2 and 1i13/2. The shell thus have D(N = 5) - D(1h11/2) + D(1i13/2) = 42 - 12 + 14 = 44 levels\n(D(N) = (N + 1)(N + 2)). The predicted magic number is then 126.\n- N = 7 → 1j15/2 is added to the N = 6 shell, to give D(N = 6) - D(1i13/2) + D(1j15/2) = 56 - 14 + 16 = 58,\npredicting a yet not-observed 184 magic number.\nHarmonic Oscillator\nSpin-Orbit Potential\nSpecroscopic\nMagic\nSpin-orbit D\nN\nl\nNotation\nNumber\n2g\n3d\n4s\n1i\n1i13/2\n1i11/2\n. . .\n3p\n3p1/2\n3p3/2\n2f\n2f5/2\n1p3/2\n1s\n1s1/2\nFig. 38: Shell Model prediction of the magic numbers. Level splittings due to h.o. levels, l-quantum number and spin-orbit\ncoupling. Notice that further variations in the position of the levels are actually present (see Krane Fig. 5.6). Here only the\nshiftings leading to new shell groupings are shown.\nThese predictions do not depend on the exact shape of the square well potential, but only on the spin-orbit coupling\nand its relative strength to the nuclear interaction V0 as set in the harmonic oscillator potential (we had seen that\nthe separation between oscillator levels was on the order of 10MeV.) In practice, if one studies in more detail the\n\nDiagram of sh\nell model energy l\nevels\n.

However it can make many predictions about\nthe nuclide properties. For example it predicts the nuclear spin and parity, the magnetic dipole moment and electric\nquadrupolar moment, and it can even be used to calculate the probability of transitions from one state to another\nas a result of radioactive decay or nuclear reactions.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare. After Krane.\nFig. 39: Shell Model energy levels (from Krane Fig. 5.6). Left: Calculated energy levels based on potential. To the right of\neach level are its capacity and cumulative number of nucleons up to that level. The spin-orbit interaction splits the levels with\nl > 0 into two new levels. Note that the shell effect is quite apparent, and magic numbers are reproduced exactly.\n5.3.4 Spin pairing and valence nucleons\nIn the extreme shell model (or extreme independent particle model), the assumption is that only the last unpaired\nnucleon dictates the properties of the nucleus. A better approximation would be to consider all the nucleons above\na filled shell as contributing to the properties of a nucleus. These nucleons are called the valence nucleons.\nProperties that can be predicted by the characteristics of the valence nucleons include the magnetic dipole moment,\nthe electric quadrupole moment, the excited states and the spin-parity (as we will see). The shell model can be then\nused not only to predict excited states, but also to calculate the rate of transitions from one state to another due to\nradioactive decay or nuclear reactions.\nAs the proton and neutron levels are filled the nucleons of each type pair off, yielding a zero angular momentum for\nthe pair. This pairing of nucleons implies the existence of a pairing force that lowers the energy of the system when\nthe nucleons are paired-off.\nSince the nucleons get paired-off, the total spin and parity of a nucleus is only given by the last unpaired nucleon(s)\n(which reside(s) in the highest energy level). Specifically we can have either one neutron or one proton or a pair\nneutron-proton.\nThe parity for a single nucleon is (-1)l, and the overall parity of a nucleus is the product of the single nucleon parity.\n(The parity indicates if the wavefunction changes sign when changing the sign of the coordinates. This is of course\n\ndictated by the angular part of the wavefunction - as in spherical coordinates r ≥ 0. Then if you look back at the\nangular wavefunction for a central potential it is easy to see that the spherical harmonics change sign iff l is odd).\nObs. The shell model with pairing force predicts a nuclear spin I = 0 and parity Π =even (or IΠ = 0+) for all\neven-even nuclides.\nA. Odd-Even nuclei\nDespite its crudeness, the shell model with the spin-orbit correction describes well the spin and parity of all odd-A\nnuclei. In particular, all odd-A nuclei will have half-integer spin (since the nucleons, being fermions, have half-integer\nspin).\nExample: 15\n8 O7 and 17\n8 O9. (of course 16O has spin zero and even parity because all the nucleons are paired). The first\n(15\n8 O7) has an unpaired neutron in the p1/2 shell, than l = 1, s = 1/2 and we would predict the isotope to have spin\n1/2 and odd parity. The ground state of 17\n8 O9 instead has the last unpaired neutron in the d5/2 shell, with l = 2 and\ns = 5/2, thus implying a spin 5/2 with even parity. Both these predictions are confirmed by experiments.\nExamples: These are even-odd nuclides (i.e. with A odd).\n+\n→\nSb72 has 1proton in 1g7/2: →\n2 .\n+\n→\nCs has 1proton in 1g7/2: →\n2 .\n+\n→ 17Cl has 1proton in 1d3/2: →\n2 .\n+\n→ 14Si has 1 neutron in 2s1/2: →\n2 .\n0+\n→ 14Si has paired nucleons: →\n.\nExample: There are some nuclides that seem to be exceptions:\n+\n→\nSb70 has last proton in 2d5/2 instead of 1g7/2: →\n(details in the potential could account for the inversion\nof the two level order)\n-\n→\nSn85 has last proton in 2f7/2 instead of 1h9/2: →\n2 .\n-\n→ 35Br44 has last neutron in 2p3/2 instead of 1f5/2: →\n2 .\n→\nPb125. Here we invert 1i13/2 with 3p1/2. This seems to be wrong because the 1i level must be quite more\nenergetic than the 3p one. However, when we move a neutron from the 3p to the 1i all the neutrons in the 1i level\nare now paired, thus lowering the energy of this new configuration.\n-\n→ 28Ni33 1f5/2 ←→ 2p3/2 → ( 3 )\n+\n→\nAu118 1f5/2 ←→ 3p3/2 → ( 3 )\nB. Odd-Odd nuclei\nOnly five stable nuclides contain both an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons: the first four\nodd-odd nuclides 2\n1H,6\n5 B, and 14\n3Li, 10\n7 N. These nuclides have two unpaired nucleons (or odd-odd nuclides), thus their\nspin is more complicated to calculate. The total angular momentum can then take values between |j1-j2| and j1+j2.\nTwo processes are at play:\n1) the nuclei tends to have the smallest angular momentum, and\n2) the nucleon spins tend to align (this was the same effect that we saw for example in the deuteron In any case, the\nresultant nuclear spin is going to be an integer number.\nC. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\nThe nuclear spin is important in chemical spectroscopy and medical imaging. The manipulation of nuclear spin by\nradiofrequency waves is at the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance and of magnetic resonance imaging. Then, the\nspin property of a particular isotope can be predicted when you know the number of neutrons and protons and the\nshell model. For example, it is easy to predict that hydrogen, which is present in most of the living cells, will have\nspin 1/2. We already saw that deuteron instead has spin 1. What about Carbon, which is also commonly found in\nbiomolecules? 6 C is of course and even-even nucleus, so we expect it to have spin-0. 13\n6 C7 instead has one unpaired\nneutron. Then 13C has spin- 1 .\n\nh\ni\n\nWhy can nuclear spin be manipulated by electromagnetic fields? To each spin there is an associated magnetic dipole,\ngiven by:\ngμN\nμ =\nI = γN I\nr\nwhere γN is called the gyromagnetic ratio, g is the g-factor (that we are going to explain) and μN is the nuclear\nen\nmagneton μN = 2m ≈ 3 × 10-8eV/T (with m the proton mass). The g factor is derived from a combination of the\nangular momentum g-factor and the spin g-factor. For protons gl = 1, while it is gl = 0 for neutrons as they don't\nhave any charge. The spin g-factor can be calculated by solving the relativistic quantum mechanics equation, so it is\na property of the particles themselves (and a dimensionless number). For protons and neutrons we have: gs,p = 5.59\nand gs,n = -3.83.\nIn order to have an operational definition of the magnetic dipole associated to a given angular momentum, we define\nit to be the expectation value of ˆμ when the system is in the state with the maximum z angular momentum:\nHow can we calculate sz ? There are two cases, either j = l + 1\n2 or j = l -1\nˆ\nˆ\nˆ\n. And notice that we want to find the\nJ|J\nˆS·\n|J|2\noperators with their expectation values (in the case where jz = jr), we obtain\nˆ\nˆ\n|\nR\nR\nS in the state which is aligned with J, so we want the expectation value of\nprojection of\n. By replacing the\n(thus we have a small correction due to the fact that we are taking an expectation value with respect to a tilted state\nand not the usual state aligned with Sˆz. Remember that the state is well defined in the coupled representation, so\nthe uncoupled representation states are no longer good eigenstates).\nFinally the dipole is\notherwise. Notice that the exact g-factor or gyromagnetic ratio of an isotope is difficult to calculate: this is just an\napproximation based on the last unpaired nucleon model, interactions among all nucleons should in general be taken\ninto account.\nD. More complex structures\nOther characteristics of the nuclear structure can be explained by more complex interactions and models. For example\nall even-even nuclides present an anomalous 2+ excited state (Since all even-even nuclides are 0+ we have to look\nat the excited levels to learn more about the spin configuration.) This is a hint that the properties of all nucleons\nplay a role into defining the nuclear structure. This is exactly the terms in the nucleons Hamiltonian that we had\ndecided to neglect in first approximation. A different model would then to consider all the nucleons (instead of a\nsingle nucleons in an external potential) and describe their property in a collective way. This is similar to a liquid\ndrop model. Then important properties will be the vibrations and rotations of this model.\nA different approach is for example to consider not only the effects of the last unpaired nucleon but also all the\nnucleons outside the last closed shell. For more details on these models, see Krane.\n⟨μ⟩= μN\nħ⟨gllz + gssz⟩= μN\nħ⟨gljz + (gs -gl)sz⟩\nThen under our assumptions jz = jħ(and of course lz = ħmz and sz = ħms) we have\n⟨μ⟩= μN\nħ(gljħ+ (gs -gl) ⟨sz⟩)\n⟨sz⟩= + ħ\n2 for j = l + 1\n2.\n⟨sz⟩= -ħ\nj\nj+1 for j = l -1\n2.\n⟨μ⟩= μN\n\ngl(j -1\n2) + gs\n\nfor j = l + 1\n2 and\n⟨μ⟩= μNgl\n\ngl\nj(j + 3\n2)\nj + 1\n-gs\nj + 1\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Since we were interested mostly\nin the equilibrium states of nuclei and in their energies, we only needed to look at a time-independent description\nof quantum-mechanical systems. To describe dynamical processes, such as radiation decays, scattering and nuclear\nreactions, we need to study how quantum mechanical systems evolve in time.\n6.1 Time-dependent Schro dinger equation\nWhen we first introduced quantum mechanics, we saw that the fourth postulate of QM states that:\nThe evolution of a closed system is unitary (reversible). The evolution is given by the time-dependent Schr odinger\nequation\n∂|ψ)\niI\n= H|ψ)\n∂t\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian of the system (the energy operator) and I is the reduced Planck constant\n(I = h/2π with h the Planck constant, allowing conversion from energy to frequency units).\nWe will focus mainly on the Schr odinger equation to describe the evolution of a quantum-mechanical system. The\nstatement that the evolution of a closed quantum system is unitary is however more general. It means that the state\nof a system at a later time t is given by |ψ(t)) = U(t) |ψ(0)), where U(t) is a unitary operator. An operator is unitary\nif its adjoint U + (obtained by taking the transpose and the complex conjugate of the operator, U + = (U ∗)T ) is equal\nU -1\nto its inverse: U + =\nor UU + = 11.\nNote that the expression |ψ(t)) = U(t) |ψ(0)) is an integral equation relating the state at time zero with the state at\ntime t. For example, classically we could write that x(t) = x(0) + vt (where v is the speed, for constant speed). We\ncan as well write a differential equation that provides the same information: the Schr odinger equation. Classically\nfor example, (in the example above) the equivalent differential equation would be dx = v (more generally we would\ndt\nhave Newton's equation linking the acceleration to the force). In QM we have a differential equation that control the\nevolution of closed systems. This is the Schr odinger equation:\n∂ψ(x, t)\niI\n= Hψ(x, t)\n∂t\nwhere H is the system's Hamiltonian. The solution to this partial differential equation gives the wavefunction ψ(x, t)\nat any later time, when ψ(x, 0) is known.\n6.1.1 Solutions to the Schro dinger equation\npˆ\nWe first try to find a solution in the case where the Hamiltonian H =\n+ V (x, t) is such that the potential V (x, t)\n2m\nis time independent (we can then write V (x)). In this case we can use separation of variables to look for solutions.\nThat is, we look for solutions that are a product of a function of position only and a function of time only:\nψ(x, t) = φ(x)f(t)\n\nThen, when we take the partial derivatives we have that\n∂ψ(x, t)\ndf(t)\n∂ψ(x, t)\ndφ(x)\n∂2ψ(x, t)\nd2φ(x)\n=\nφ(x),\n=\nf(t) and\n=\nf(t)\n∂t\ndt\n∂x\ndx\n∂x2\ndx2\nThe Schr odinger equation simplifies to\ndf(t)\nI2 d2φ(x)\niI\nφ(x) = -\nf(t) + V (x)φ(x)f(t)\ndt\n2m\nx2\nDividing by ψ(x, t) we have:\ndf(t)\nI2 d2φ(x)\niI\n= -\n+ V (x)\ndt f(t)\n2m\nx2\nφ(x)\nNow the LHS is a function of time only, while the RHS is a function of position only. For the equation to hold, both\nsides have then to be equal to a constant (separation constant):\ndf(t)\nI2 d2φ(x)\niI\n= E, -\n+ V (x) = E\ndt f(t)\n2m\nx2\nφ(x)\nThe two equations we find are a simple equation in the time variable:\n-i Et\ndf(t)\ni\ni\n= - Ef(t), →\nf(t) = f(0)e\ndt\nI\nand\nI2 d2φ(x)\n-\n+ V (x) = E\n2m\nx2\nφ(x)\nthat we have already seen as the time-independent Schr odinger equation. We have extensively studied the solutions\nof the this last equation, as they are the eigenfunctions of the energy-eigenvalue problem, giving the stationary (equi\nlibrium) states of quantum systems. Note that for these stationary solutions φ(x) we can still find the corresponding\ntotal wavefunction, given as stated above by ψ(x, t) = φ(x)f(t), which does describe also the time evolution of the\nsystem:\nψ(x, t) = φ(x)e -i Et\ni\nDoes this mean that the states that up to now we called stationary are instead evolving in time?\nThe answer is yes, but with a caveat. Although the states themselves evolve as stated above, any measurable quantity\n(such as the probability density |ψ(x, t)|2 or the expectation values of observable, (A) =\nJ\nψ(x, t)∗A[ψ(x, t)]) are still\ntime-independent. (Check it!)\nThus we were correct in calling these states stationary and neglecting in practice their time-evolution when studying\nthe properties of systems they describe.\nNotice that the wavefunction built from one energy eigenfunction, ψ(x, t) = φ(x)f(t), is only a particular solution\nof the Schr odinger equation, but many other are possible. These will be complicated functions of space and time,\nwhose shape will depend on the particular form of the potential V (x). How can we describe these general solutions?\nWe know that in general we can write a basis given by the eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian. These are the functions\n{φ(x)} (as defined above by the time-independent Schr odinger equation). The eigenstate of the Hamiltonian do not\nevolve. However we can write any wavefunction as\nL\nψ(x, t) =\nck(t)φk(x)\nk\nThis just corresponds to express the wavefunction in the basis given by the energy eigenfunctions. As usual, the\ncoefficients ck(t) can be obtained at any instant in time by taking the inner product: (φk|ψ(x, t)).\nWhat is the evolution of such a function? Substituting in the Schr odinger equation we have\n∂(L\nk ck(t)φk(x))\nL\niI\n=\nck(t)Hφk(x)\n∂t\nk\nthat becomes\nL ∂(ck(t))\nL\niI\nφk(x) =\nck(t)Ekφk(x)\n∂t\nk\nk\n\nFor each φk we then have the equation in the coefficients only\ndck\n-i\nEkt\ni\niI\n= Ekck(t)\n→\nck(t) = ck(0)e\ndt\nA general solution of the Schr odinger equation is then\nEkt\nL\n-i i\nψ(x, t) =\nck(0)e\nφk(x)\nk\nObs. We can define the eigen-frequencies Iωk = Ek from the eigen-energies. Thus we see that the wavefunction is a\nsuperposition of waves φk propagating in time each with a different frequency ωk.\nThe behavior of quantum systems -even particles- thus often is similar to the propagation of waves. One example\nis the diffraction pattern for electrons (and even heavier objects) when scattering from a slit. We saw an example in\nthe electron diffraction video at the beginning of the class.\nObs. What is the probability of measuring a certain energy Ek at a time t? It is given by the coefficient of the φk\n-i i\neigenfunction, |ck(t)|2 = |ck(0)e\nEkt |2 = |ck(0)|2. This means that the probability for the given energy is constant,\ndoes not change in time. Energy is then a so-called constant of the motion. This is true only for the energy eigenvalues,\nnot for other observables'.\nExample: Consider instead the probability of finding the system at a certain position, p(x) = |ψ(x, t)|2. This of course\nchanges in time. For example, let ψ(x, 0) = c1(0)φ1(x) + c2(0)φ2(x), with |c1(0)|2 + |c2(0)|2 = |c1|2 + |c2|2 = 1 (and\nφ1,2 normalized energy eigenfunctions. Then at a later time we have ψ(x, 0) = c1(0)e-iω1tφ1(x) + c2(0)e-iω2tφ2(x).\nWhat is p(x, t)?\n\n-iω2 tφ2(x)\nc1(0)e -iω1tφ1(x) + c2(0)e\n\n∗\n-i(ω2-ω1)t\n∗\ni(ω2-ω1)t\n= |c1(0)|2|φ1(x)|2 + |c2(0)|2|φ2(x)|2 + c1c2φ1\n∗ φ2e\n+ c1c2φ1φ ∗\n2e\n[\n]\n∗\n-i(ω2 -ω1)t\n= |c1|2 + |c2|2 + 2Re c1c2φ ∗\n1φ2e\nThe last term describes a wave interference between different components of the initial wavefunction.\nObs.: The expressions found above for the time-dependent wavefunction are only valid if the potential is itself\ntime-independent. If this is not the case, the solutions are even more difficult to obtain.\n6.1.2 Unitary Evolution\nWe saw two equivalent formulation of the quantum mechanical evolution, the Schr odinger equation and the Heisenberg\nequation. We now present a third possible formulation: following the 4th postulate we express the evolution of a state\nin terms of a unitary operator, called the propagator:\nˆ\nψ(x, t) = U(t)ψ(x, 0)\nwith Uˆ +Uˆ = 11. (Notice that a priori the unitary operator Uˆ could also be a function of space). We can show that\nthis is equivalent to the Schr odinger equation, by verifying that ψ(x, t) above is a solution:\n∂ ˆ\n∂ ˆ\nUψ(x, 0)\nU\nH ˆ\niI\n=\nUψ(x, 0)\n→\niI\n= HUˆ\n∂t\n∂t\nwhere in the second step we used the fact that since the equation holds for any wavefunction ψ it must hold for the\noperator themselves. If the Hamiltonian is time independent, the second equation can be solved easily, obtaining:\n∂Uˆ\n-iHt/n\niI\n= HUˆ\n→\nUˆ(t) = e\n∂t\niHt/n -iHt/n\nwhere we set Uˆ(t = 0) = 11. Notice that as desired Uˆ is unitary, Uˆ +Uˆ = e\ne\n= 11.\n6.2 Evolution of wave-packets\nIn Section 6.1.1 we looked at the evolution of a general wavefunction under a time-independent Hamiltonian. The\nsolution to the Schr odinger equation was given in terms of a linear superposition of energy eigenfunctions, each\nacquiring a time-dependent phase factor. The solution was then the superposition of waves each with a different\nfrequency.\n\nNow we want to study the case where the eigenfunctions form form a continuous basis, {φk} →{φ(k)}. More\nprecisely, we want to describe how a free particle evolves in time. We already found the eigenfunctions of the free\nparticle Hamiltonian (H = pˆ2/2m): they were given by the momentum eigenfunctions eikx and describe more properly\na traveling wave. A particle localized in space instead can be described by wavepacket ψ(x, 0) initially well localized\nin x-space (for example, a Gaussian wavepacket).\nHow does this wave-function evolve in time? First, following Section 2.2.1, we express the wavefunction in terms of\nmomentum (and energy) eigenfunctions:\nJ inf\nψ (k) eikx dk,\nψ(x, 0) = √\n2π\n-inf\n\nWe saw that this is equivalent to the Fourier transform of ψ (k), then ψ(x, 0) and ψ(k) are a Fourier pair (can be\nobtained from each other via a Fourier transform).\n\nThus the function ψ(k) is obtained by Fourier transforming the wave-function at t = 0. Notice again that the function\nψ(k) is the continuous-variable equivalent of the coefficients ck(0).\nThe second step is to evolve in time the superposition. From the previous section we know that each energy eigen\nfunction evolves by acquiring a phase e-iω(k)t, where ω(k) = Ek/I is the energy eigenvalue. Then the time evolution\nof the wavefunction is\nJ inf\n\nψ(x, t) =\nψ(k) e i φ(k) dk,\n-inf\nwhere\nφ(k) = k x - ω(k) t.\nnk2\nFor the free particle we have ωk =\n. If the particle encounters instead a potential (such as in the potential barrier\n2m\nor potential well problems we already saw) ωk could have a more complex form. We will thus consider this more\ngeneral case.\n\nNow, if ψ(k) is strongly peaked around k = k0, it is a reasonable approximation to Taylor expand φ(k) about k0.\n(k-k0) 2\nWe can then approximate ψ (k) by ψ (k) ≈ e\n-4 (Δk)2 and keeping terms up to second-order in k - k0, we obtain\nJ inf\n(k-k0) 2\n\n{\n}\nφ ′′\nψ(x, t) ∝\ne\n-4 (Δk)2 exp -i k x + i\nφ0 + φ ′\n0 (k - k0) + 1\n0 (k - k0) 2\n,\n-inf\nwhere\nφ0\n=\nφ(k0) = k0 x - ω0 t,\ndφ(k0)\nφ ′\n=\n= x - vg t,\ndk\nφ ′′\nd2φ(k0)\n=\n= -α t,\ndk2\n{\n0 (k - k0) 2\n}\nφ ′′\n-i k x + i\nk0 x - ω0 t + (x - vg t) (k - k0) + 2\nwith\ndω(k0)\nd2ω(k0)\nω0 = ω(k0),\nvg =\n,\nα =\n.\ndk\ndk2\nAs usual, the variance of the initial wavefunction and of its Fourier transform are relates: Δk = 1/(2 Δx), where Δx\nis the initial width of the wave-packet and Δk the spread in the momentum. Changing the variable of integration to\ny = (k - k0)/(2 Δk), we get\nJ inf\ni (k0 x-ω0 t)\ni β1 y-(1+i β2) y\nψ(x, t) ∝ e\ne\ndy,\n-inf\nwhere\nβ1\n=\n2 Δk (x - x0 - vg t),\nβ2\n=\n2 α (Δk) 2 t,\nThe above expression can be rearranged to give\nJ inf\ni(k0 x-ω0 t)-(1+iβ2) β2/4\n-(1+iβ2) (y-y0)2\nψ(x, t) ∝ e\ne\ndy,\n-inf\nwhere y0 = i β/2 and β = β1/(1 + i β2).\nAgain changing the variable of integration to z = (1 + i β2)1/2 (y - y0) , we get\nJ inf\ni (k0 x-ω0 t)-(1+i β2 ) β 2/4\n-z\nψ(x, t) ∝ (1 + i β2)-1/2 e\ne\n2 dz.\n-inf\n\nThe integral now just reduces to a number. Hence, we obtain\n(x-x0-vg t)2[1-i2 αΔk2t]\nei(k0 x-ω0 t)e\n-\n4 σ(t)2\nψ(x, t) ∝\n,\np\n1 + i2 α (Δk)2 t\nwhere\nα2 t2\nσ2(t) = (Δx) 2 +\n.\n4 (Δx) 2\nNote that even if we made an approximation earlier by Taylor expanding the phase factor φ(k) about k = k0, the\nabove wave-function is still identical to our original wave-function at t = 0.\nThe probability density of our particle as a function of times is written\n(x - x0 - vg t) 2\n|ψ(x, t)| 2 ∝ σ-1(t) exp -\n.\n2 σ 2(t)\nHence, the probability distribution is a Gaussian, of characteristic width σ(t) (increasing in time), which peaks at\nx = x0 + vg t. Now, the most likely position of our particle obviously coincides with the peak of the distribution\nfunction. Thus, the particle's most likely position is given by\nx = x0 + vg t.\nIt can be seen that the particle effectively moves at the uniform velocity\ndω\nvg =\n,\ndk\nwhich is known as the group-velocity. In other words, a plane-wave travels at the phase-velocity, vp = ω/k, whereas\na wave-packet travels at the group-velocity, vg = dω/dt vg = dω/dt. From the dispersion relation for particle waves\nthe group velocity is\nd(Iω)\nd E\np\nvg =\n=\n=\n.\nd(Ik)\nd p\nm\nwhich is identical to the classical particle velocity. Hence, the dispersion relation turns out to be consistent with\nclassical physics, after all, as soon as we realize that particles must be identified with wave-packets rather than\nplane-waves.\nNote that the width of our wave-packet grows as time progresses: the characteristic time for a wave-packet of original\nwidth Δx Δx to double in spatial extent is\nm (Δx)2\nt2 ∼\n.\nI\nSo, if an electron is originally localized in a region of atomic scale (i.e., Δx ∼ 10-10 m ) then the doubling time is\nonly about 10-16s. Clearly, particle wave-packets (for freely moving particles) spread very rapidly.\nThe rate of spreading of a wave-packet is ultimately governed by the second derivative of ω(k) with respect to k,\n∂2ω\n∂k2 . This is why the relationship between ω and k is generally known as a dispersion relation, because it governs\nhow wave-packets disperse as time progresses.\nIf we consider light-waves, then ω is a linear function of k and the second derivative of ω with respect to k is zero.\nThis implies that there is no dispersion of wave-packets, wave-packets propagate without changing shape. This is\nof course true for any other wave for which ω(k) ∝ k. Another property of linear dispersion relations is that the\nphase-velocity, vp = ω/k, and the group-velocity, vg = dω/dk are identical. Thus a light pulse propagates at the\nsame speed of a plane light-wave; both propagate through a vacuum at the characteristic speed c = 3 × 108 m/s .\nOf course, the dispersion relation for particle waves is not linear in k (for example for free particles is quadratic).\nHence, particle plane-waves and particle wave-packets propagate at different velocities, and particle wave-packets\nalso gradually disperse as time progresses.\n6.3 Evolution of operators and expectation values\nThe Schr odinger equation describes how the state of a system evolves. Since via experiments we have access to\nobservables and their outcomes, it is interesting to find a differential equation that directly gives the evolution of\nexpectation values.\n\n6.3.1 Heisenberg Equation\nWe start from the definition of expectation value and take its derivative wrt time\nJ\nd (Aˆ)\nd\n=\nd3x ψ(x, t) ∗ Aˆ[ψ(x, t)]\nd t\ndt\nJ\nJ\nJ\n∂ψ(x, t)∗ ˆ\n∂Aˆ\n∂ψ(x, t)\n=\nd3 x\nAψ(x, t) +\nd3x ψ(x, t) ∗\nψ(x, t) +\nd3xψ(x, t) ∗ Aˆ\n∂t\n∂t\n∂t\nWe then use the Schr odinger equation:\n∂ψ(x, t)\ni\n∂ψ∗(x, t)\ni\n= - Hψ(x, t),\n=\n(Hψ(x, t)) ∗\n∂t\nI\n∂t\nI\nand the fact (Hψ(x, t))∗ = ψ(x, t)∗H∗ = ψ(x, t)∗H (since the Hamiltonian is hermitian H∗ = H). With this, we have\n\\ )\nˆ\nd A\nJ\nJ\nJ\ni\n∂Aˆ\ni\n=\nd3x ψ(x, t) ∗ H ˆ\nd3x ψ(x, t) ∗\nAψ(x, t) +\nψ(x, t) -\nd3x ψ(x, t) ∗ AˆHψ(x, t)\ndt\nI\n∂t\nI\nJ\nJ\n= i\nd3x ψ(x, t) ∗ [\nHAˆ - AˆH\n]\nψ(x, t) +\nd3x ψ(x, t) ∗ ∂Aˆ\nψ(x, t)\nI\n∂t\n[\n]\nWe now rewrite\nHAˆ - AˆH = [H, Aˆ] as a commutator and the integrals as expectation values:\nd\n\\\nˆA\n)\ndt\n= i\nI\n\\\n[H, ˆA]\n)\n+\n*\n∂ ˆA\n∂t\n+\n\\\n)\nd(Aˆ)\ni\nˆ\nObs. Notice that if the observable itself is time independent, then the equation reduces to\n=\n[H, A] . Then if\ndt\nn\nthe observable Aˆ commutes with the Hamiltonian, we have no evolution at all of the expectation value. An observable\nthat commutes with the Hamiltonian is a constant of the motion. For example, we see again why energy is a constant\nof the motion (as seen before).\nNotice that since we can take the expectation value with respect to any wavefunction, the equation above must hold\nalso for the operators themselves. Then we have the Heisenberg equation:\ndAˆ\ni\n∂Aˆ\nˆ\n=\n[H, A]+\ndt\nI\n∂t\nThis is an equivalent formulation of the system's evolution (equivalent to the Schr odinger equation).\nObs. Notice that if the operator A is time independent and it commutes with the Hamiltonian H then the operator\nis conserved, it is a constant of the motion (not only its expectation value).\nConsider for example the angular momentum operator Lˆ2 for a central potential system (i.e. with potential that\nonly depends on the distance, V (r)). We have seen when solving the 3D time-independent equation that [H, Lˆ2] = 0.\nThus the angular momentum is a constant of the motion.\n6.3.2 Ehrenfest's theorem\nWe now apply this result to calculate the evolution of the expectation values for position and momentum.\nd (xˆ)\ni\ni ( pˆ2\n)\n=\n([H, xˆ]) =\n[\n+ V (x), xˆ]\ndt\nI\nI\n2m\nNow we know that [V (x), xˆ] = 0 and we already calculated [ˆp , xˆ] = -2iIpˆ. So we have:\nd (xˆ)\n=\n(pˆ)\ndt\nm\n\nNotice that this is the same equation that links the classical position with momentum (remember p/m = v velocity).\nNow we turn to the equation for the momentum:\nd ⟨ˆp⟩\ndt\n= i\nħ⟨[H, ˆp]⟩= i\nħ\n\n[ ˆp2\n2m + V (x), ˆp]\n\nHere of course [ ˆp2\n2m, ˆp] = 0, so we only need to calculate [V (x), ˆp]. We substitute the explicit expression for the\nmomentum:\n[V (x), ˆp]f(x) = V (x)\n\n-iħ∂f(x)\n∂x\n\n-\n\n-iħ∂(V (x)f(x))\n∂x\n\n= -V (x)iħ∂f(x)\n∂x\n+ iħ∂V (x)\n∂x\nf(x) + iħ∂f(x)\n∂x\nV (x) = iħ∂V (x)\n∂x\nf(x)\nThen,\nd ⟨ˆp⟩\ndt\n= -\n∂V (x)\n∂x\n\nObs. Notice that in these two equations ħhas been canceled out. Also the equation involve only real variables (as in\nclassical mechanics).\nObs. Usually, the derivative of a potential function is a force, so we can write -∂V (x)\n∂x\n= F(x)\nIf we could approximate ⟨F(x)⟩≈F(⟨x⟩), then the two equations are rewritten:\nd ⟨ˆx⟩\ndt\n= 1\nm ⟨ˆp⟩\nd ⟨ˆp⟩\ndt\n= F(⟨x⟩)\nThese are two equations in the expectation values only. Then we could just make the substitutions ⟨ˆp⟩→p and\n⟨ˆx⟩→x (i.e. identify the expectation values of QM operators with the corresponding classical variables). We obtain\nin this way the usual classical equation of motions. This is Ehrenfest's theorem.\nF(x)\n<x>\n<x>\nF(<x>)\nF(<x>) ≈ <F(x)>\nF(<x>) = <F(x)>\n∆x\n|ψ(x)|2\nF(x)\n|ψ(x)|2\nFig. 40: Localized (left) and spread-out (right) wavefunction. In the plot the absolute value square of the wavefunction is shown\nin blue (corresponding to the position probability density) for a system approaching the classical limit (left) or showing more\nquantum behavior. The force acting on the system is shown in black (same in the two plots). The shaded areas indicate the\nregion over which |ψ(x)|2 is non-negligible, thus giving an idea of the region over which the force is averaged. The wavefunctions\ngive the same average position ⟨x⟩. However, while for the left one F(⟨x⟩) ≈⟨F(x)⟩, for the right wavefunction F(⟨x⟩) = ⟨F(x)⟩\nWhen is the approximation above valid? We want\nD\n∂V (x)\n∂x\nE\n≈∂V (⟨x⟩)\n∂⟨x⟩. This means that the wavefunction is localized\nenough such that the width of the position probability distribution is small compared to the typical length scale\nover which the potential varies. When this condition is satisfied, then the expectation values of quantum-mechanical\nprobability observable will follow a classical trajectory.\nAssume for example ψ(x) is an eigenstate of the position operator ψ(x) = δ(x - x). Then ⟨ˆx⟩=\nR\ndx xδ(x - x)2 = x\nand\n∂V (x)\n∂x\n\n=\nZ ∂V (x)\n∂x\nδ(x -⟨x⟩)dx = ∂V (⟨x⟩)\n∂⟨x⟩\nIf instead the wavefunction is a packet centered around ⟨x⟩but with a finite width ∆x (i.e. a Gaussian function) we\nno longer have an equality but only an approximation if ∆x ≪L =\nV\n∂V (x)\n∂x\n\n-1\n(or localized wavefunction).\n\n6.4 Fermi's Golden Rule\nWe consider now a system with an Hamiltonian H0, of which we know the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions:\nH0uk(x) = Ekuk(x) = Iωkuk(x)\nHere I just expressed the energy eigenvalues in terms of the frequencies ωk = Ek/I. Then, a general state will evolve\nas:\nL\n-iωkt\nψ(x, t) =\nck(0)e\nuk(x)\nk\nIf the system is in its equilibrium state, we expect it to be stationary, thus the wavefunction will be one of the\neigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. For example, if we consider an atom or a nucleus, we usually expect to find it in\nits ground state (the state with the lowest energy). We consider this to be the initial state of the system:\nψ(x, 0) = ui(x)\n(where i stands for initial ). Now we assume that a perturbation is applied to the system. For example, we could\nhave a laser illuminating the atom, or a neutron scattering with the nucleus. This perturbation introduces an extra\npotential Vˆ in the system's Hamiltonian (a priori Vˆ can be a function of both position and time Vˆ (x, t), but we will\nˆ\nconsider the simpler case of time-independent potential V (x)). Now the hamiltonian reads:\nH = H0 + Vˆ (x)\nWhat we should do, is to find the eigenvalues {Ev} and eigenfunctions {vh(x)} of this new Hamiltonian and express\nh\nui(x) in this new basis and see how it evolves:\nL\nL\n-iEvt/n\nh\nui(x) =\ndh(0)vh\n→\nψ ′ (x, t) =\ndh(0)e\nvh(x).\nh\nh\nMost of the time however, the new Hamiltonian is a complex one, and we cannot calculate its eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions. Then we follow another strategy.\nConsider the examples above (atom+laser or nucleus+neutron): What we want to calculate is the probability of\nmaking a transition from an atom/nucleus energy level to another energy level, as induced by the interaction. Since\nH0 is the original Hamiltonian describing the system, it makes sense to always describe the state in terms of its\nenergy levels (i.e. in terms of its eigenfunctions). Then, we guess a solution for the state of the form:\nL\n-iωkt\nψ ′ (x, t) =\nck(t)e\nuk(x)\nk\nThis is very similar to the expression for ψ(x, t) above, except that now the coefficient ck are time dependent. The\ntime-dependency derives from the fact that we added an extra potential interaction to the Hamiltonian.\n∂ψ ′\nH0ψ ′ + ˆ\nLet us now insert this guess into the Schr odinger equation, iI ∂t =\nV ψ ′ :\nL [\n-iωkt\n-iωkt\n]\nL\n-iωkt (\nˆ\n)\niI\nc k(t)e\nuk(x) - iωck(t)e\nuk(x) =\nck(t)e\nH0uk(x) + V [uk(x)]\nk\nk\n(where c is the time derivative). Using the eigenvalue equation to simplify the RHS we find\n[\n]\n[\n\n]\nL\n\nL\n\n-iωkt\n-iωkt\n-iωkt\n-iωkt ˆ\niIc k(t)e\nIωck(t)e\n=\nck(t)e\nck(t)e\nuk(x) + uk(x)\nI ω\nkuk(x) +\nV [uk(x)]\nk\nk\nL\nL\n-iωkt\n-iωkt ˆ\niIc k(t)e\nuk(x) =\nck(t)e\nV [uk(x)]\nk\nk\nNow let us take the inner product of each side with uh(x):\nJ inf\nJ inf\nL\nL\n-iωkt\n∗\n-iωkt\n∗\niIc k(t)e\nuh(x)uk(x)dx =\nck(t)e\nuh(x)Vˆ [uk(x)]dx\n-inf\n-inf\nk\nk\nJ inf\n∗\nIn the LHS we find that\n-inf uh(x)uk(x)dx = 0 for h =\nk and it is 1 for h = k (the eigenfunctions are orthonormal).\nThen in the sum over k the only term that survives is the one k = h:\nJ inf\nL\n-iωkt\n∗\n-iωht\niIc k(t)e\nuh(x)uk(x)dx = iIc h(t)e\n-inf\nk\n\nOn the RHS we do not have any simplification. To shorten the notation however, we call Vhk the integral:\nJ inf\n∗\nVhk =\nuh(x)Vˆ [uk(x)]dx\n-inf\nThe equation then simplifies to:\nc h(t) = - i L\nck(t)e i(ωh-ωk)tVhk\nI k\nThis is a differential equation for the coefficients ch(t). We can express the same relation using an integral equation:\nJ t\n′\ni(ωh-ωk)t\nch(t) = - i L\nck(t ′ )e\nVhkdt ′ + ch(0)\nI\nk\nWe now make an important approximation. We said at the beginning that the potential Vˆ is a perturbation, thus\nwe assume that its effects are small (or the changes happen slowly). Then we can approximate ck(t ′ ) in the integral\nwith its value at time 0, ck(t = 0):\nJ t\n′\ni(ωh-ωk)t\nch(t) = - i L\nck(0)\ne\nVhkdt ′ + ch(0)\nI\nk\n[Notice: for a better approximation, an iterative procedure can be used which replaces ck(t ′ ) with its first order\nsolution, then second etc.].\nNow let's go back to the initial scenario, in which we assumed that the system was initially at rest, in a stationary\nstate ψ(x, 0) = ui(x). This means that ck(0) = 0 for all k = i. The equation then reduces to:\nJ t\n′\ni(ωh-ωi)t\nch(t) = - i\ne\nVhidt ′\nI\nor, by calling Δωh = ωh - ωi,\ni\nJ t\niΔωht\nVhi iΔωht\nch(t) = - Vhi\ne\n′ dt ′ = -\n1 - e\nI\nIΔωh\nWhat we are really interested in is the probability of making a transition from the initial state ui(x) to another\nstate uh(x): P (i → h) = |ch(t)|2. This transition is caused by the extra potential Vˆ but we assume that both initial\nand final states are eigenfunctions of the original Hamiltonian H0 (notice however that the final state will be a\nsuperposition of all possible states to which the system can transition to).\nWe obtain\n)2\n4|Vhi|2\n( Δωht\nP (i → h) =\nsin\nI2Δωh\nsin(Δωt/2)\nThe function sin z is called a sinc function (see figure 41). Take\n. In the limit t →inf (i.e. assuming we are\nz\nΔω/2\ndescribing the state of the system after the new potential has had a long time to change the state of the quantum\nsystem) the sinc function becomes very narrow, until when we can approximate it with a delta function. The exact\nlimit of the function gives us:\n2π|Vhi|2t\nP (i → h) =\nδ(Δωh)\nI2\nd P (i→h)\nWe can then find the transition rate from i → h as the probability of transition per unit time, Wih =\n:\nd t\n2π\nWih = I2 |Vhi|2δ(Δωh)\nThis is the so-called Fermi's Golden Rule, describing the transition rate between states.\nObs.: This transition rate describes the transition from ui to a single level uh with a given energy Eh = Iωh. In many\ncases the final state is an unbound state, which, as we saw, can take on a continuous of possible energy available.\nThen, instead of the point-like delta function, we consider the transition to a set of states with energies in a small\ninterval E → E + dE. The transition rate is then proportional to the number of states that can be found with this\n\nDω\nDω\nsin(Δωt/2)\nFig. 41: Sinc function\nΔω/2\n. Left: Sinc function at short times. Right: Sinc function at longer times, the function becoming\nnarrower and closer to a Dirac delta function\nenergy. The number of state is given by dn = ρ(E)dE, where ρ(E) is called the density of states (we will see how to\ncalculate this in a later lecture). Then, Fermi's Golden rule is more generally expressed as:\n2π\nWih =\n|Vhi|2 ρ(Eh)|Eh =Ei\nI\n[Note, before making the substitution δ(Δω) → ρ(E) we need to write δ(Δω) = Iδ(IΔω) = Iδ(Eh - Ei) →\nIρ(Eh)|Eh =Ei. This is why in the final formulation for the Golden rule we only have a factor I and not its square.]\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n22.02 Introduction to Applied Nuclear Physics\nSpring 2012\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "1. Scattering Theory\nWe want to describe the interaction of radiation with matter as a scattering process. Specifically, we are interested in calculating the rate\nof scattering (and then the cross section), which is nothing else than the transition rate from an initial state (initial state of the matter +\nincoming particle) and a final state (final state of the target + outgoing radiation).\nThis is a problem that can be solved by using Fermi's Golden rule. We describe a scattering event as a particle coming close to a target\nor a medium, interacting with it and then being deflected away, thus we can define initial and final states and transition between them.\n1.1 Cross Section\nThe scattering cross section is defined as the rate of scattering divided by the incoming flux of \"particles\":\nd 2σ\nd ΩdE ∝WS(Ω, E)\nΦinc\nWe consider a particle + medium system, where the particle is some radiation represented by a plane wave of momentum k. In general,\nwe will have to define also other degrees of freedom denoted by the index λ, e.g for photons we will have to define the polarization while\nfor particles (e.g.e neutrons) the spin.\nThe unperturbed Hamiltonian is\n0 =\nR+\nM (radiation and medium). We assume that for t\nthe radiation and matter systems\nare independent, with (eigen)stat\nH\nes:\nH\nH\n→±inf\n|i⟩= |ki, mi⟩,\n|f⟩= |kf, mf⟩\nwith energies:\nHR |ki⟩= ħωi |ki⟩,\nHR |kf⟩= ħωf |kf⟩,\nHM |mi⟩= oi |ki⟩,\nHM |mf⟩= of |mf⟩\nand total energies: Ei = ħωi + oi and Ef = ħωf + of.\nParticle\nScattering Medium\nθ\ndΩ\nScattering Rate\nThe rate of scattering is given by the FGR:\n2π\nWfi =\nf\nħ| ⟨f| T |i⟩|2δ(E -Ei),\nwhere T is the scattering potential. As usual, we want to replace, if possible, the delta-function with the final density of states. However,\nonly the radiation will be left in a continuum of states, while the target will be left in one (of possibly many) definite state. To describe\nthis distinction, we separate the final state into the two subsystems.\nWe first define the partial projection on radiation states only, Tkf,ki = ⟨kf| T |ki⟩. By writing the delta function as an integral we have:\n2π\nWfi =\nm\nħ⟨\nf| Tkf,ki |mi⟩⟨mi| T +\nkf,ki |mf⟩\ninf\n2πħ\nZ\nei(ωf-ωi)tei(of-oi)t/ħ\n-inf\n\nNow, since e-iHRt/ħ|m ⟩= e-ioit/ħ\ni\n|mi⟩(and similarly for |mf⟩we can rewrite\n⟨m | T\n|m ⟩ei(o -o )t/ħ= ⟨m | eiH\nt/ħT\n-iH\nt/ħ\nf\ni\nR\nR\nf\nkf ,ki\ni\nf\nkf,kie\n|mi⟩= ⟨mf| Tkf,ki(t) |mi⟩\nand obtain a new expression for the rate as a correlation of \"transition\" events:\nWfi =\nω\nħ\nZ inf\nei(\nf-ωi)t\n-inf\n⟨mi| T +\nk ,k (0) |mf⟩⟨mf| Tkf,ki(t)\nf\ni\n|mi⟩\nFinal density of states\nThe final density of states describe the available states for the radiation. As we assumed that the radiation is represented by plane waves\n(and assuming for convenience they are contained in a cavity of edge L), the final density of states is\nL\nρ(k )d3\nf\nkf =\n\nk\nk2d\nπ\nf\nfdΩ\nWe can express this in terms of the energy, ρ(k)d3k = ρ(E)dEdΩ. For example, for photons, which have k = E/ħc we have\nL\nρ(E) = 2\n\n2π\n3 E2\nħ3c3 = 2\nL\n2π\n3 ω2\nk\nħc3\nwhere the factor 2 takes into account the possible polarizations. For neutrons (or other particles such that\nE = ħk2 ):\n2m\nρ(E) =\nL\n2π\n3 k\nħ2 =\nL\n2π\n3 √\n2mE\nħ3\nIf the material target can be left in more than one final state, we sum over these final states f. Then the average rate is given by\nW S = P\nf Wfiρ(E)dEdΩ(assuming that Wfi does not change very much in dΩand dE).\nIncoming Flux\nThe incoming flux is given by the number of scatterer per unit area and unit time, Φ =\n# . In the cavity considered, we can express\nA t\nthe time as t = L/v, thus the flux is Φ =\nv\n3 . For photons, this is simply Φ = c/L3, while for massive particles (neutrons) v = ħk/m,\nL\nyielding Φ =\nħk .\nmL3\n1.2 Thermal Neutron Scattering\nUsing the scattering rate above and the incoming flux and density of state expression, we can find the cross section for thermal neutrons.\nFrom\nL\nρ(E)/Φ =\n\"\n2π\n3 mkf\nħ2\n#\n/\nħki\nmL3\n\n= (mL3)2\n(2πħ)3\nkf\nki\nwe obtain\nd 2σ\nW\nρ(E) 1 Z inf\nD\nE\nmL3\ninf\nf\n=\n=\neiωfit\nT +\nk\n(0)T\n(t)\n=\nZ\neiω\nt\nħ\nħ\nfi\nif\nfi\nD\nT +\nif(0)Tfi(t) ,\nd Ωdω\nΦ\nΦ\nħ2\n-inf\n2π\n2πħ2\nki\n-inf\nE\nwhere ⟨·⟩indicates an ensemble average at the given temperature.\nNow the eigenstates |ki,f⟩are plane waves, ⟨r|k⟩= ψ (r) = eik·r\nk\n/L3/2. Then, defining Q = ki -kf the transition matrix element is\nTfi(t) = ⟨kf| T (t) |k ⟩=\nZ\nd3rψ\n(r)∗T (r, t)ψ (r) =\nZ\nd3reiQ·r\ni\nkf\nki\nT (r, t)\nL3\nL3\nL3\nand\nTfi(0)+ = L3\nZ\nd3re-iQ·rT (r, 0)+\nL3\n\nFermi Potential\nTo first order, we can approximate T by V , the nuclear potential in the center of mass frame (of the neutron+nucleus). You might recall\nthat the nuclear potential is a very strong (V0\n30MeV) and narrow (r0\n2fm) potential. These characteristics seem to preclude a\nperturbative approach, since the assumption of\n∼\na weak interaction (compar\n∼\ned to the unperturbed system energy) is not satisfied. Still,\nthe fact that the potential is narrow means that the interaction only happens for a very short time. Thus, if we average over time, we\nexpect a weak interaction. More precisely, the scattering interaction only depends on the so-called scattering length a, which is on the\norder a ∼V0r0. If we keep a constant, different combinations of V, r will give the same scattering behavior. We can thus replace the\nstrong nuclear potential with a weaker, pseudo-potential V0, provided this has a much longer range r 0, such that a ∼\n\nV0r0 = V0r 0. We\ncan choose V0, r 0 so that the potential is weak (eV) but the range is still short compared to the wavelength of the incoming neutron,\nkr 0\n2π\nħ\nV (r) =\naδ(r)\nμ\nWe can also define the bound scattering length, b =\nμ a ≈A+1, were mn is the neutron's mass and A the nucleus mass number. Then\nm\nA\nthe potential is\nn\n2π\nħ\nV (r) =\naδ(r)\nmn\nNote that b (interaction length or bound scattering length) is a function of the potential strength and range, which depend on the isotope\nfrom which the neutron is scattered off.\nThen to first order the transition matrix is T\n2π\nħ\nfi =\nb, or more generally, if there are many scatterers, each at a position rx(t), we have:\nmn\n2π\nħ\nTfi(t) =\nX\nb\niQ·rx(t)\nxe\nmn\nx\nThe scattering cross section becomes\nd 2σ\n1 k\ninf\nf\n=\nZ\neiωfit\n*X\nb b e-iQ·rx(0)eiQ·ry(t)\nx y\nd Ωdω\n2π ki\n-inf\nx,y\n+\nNotice that since the collisions are spin-dependent, we should average over isotopes and spin states and replace bxby with bxby.\n1. Then, it is possible to replace the potential with a simple delta-function at the origin.\n≪\nScattering Lengths\nNotice that b does not depend explicitly on position, although the position determines which isotope/spin we should consider. What is\nbxby? We have two contributions. For\nthis is\n, while for\n, it is\nx = y\nb2δx,y\nx = y\nb (1-δx,y). We then write b\n= ( 2\nxby\nb -b )δx,y +b =\nb2\ni + b2\nc which defines the coherent scattering length bc = b and the incoherent scattering length\nb2\ni = b -b . If there are N scatterers,\nwe have P bxby = N(b2\ni + bc).\nStructure Factors\n\nUsing these definition, we arrive at a simplified expression:\nd 2σ\nkf\n= N\nb2\ni SS(Q, ω) + b2\nd Ωdω\nk\ncS(Q, ω)\ni\nwhere we used the self-dynamic structure factor\n\nS (Q, ω) =\nZ inf\neiωfit\n*\n1 X\ne-iQ·rx(0)eiQ·rx(t)\nS\n2π\n-inf\nN\nx\n+\nwhich simplifies to\ninf\nS (Q, ω) =\nZ\neiωfit\ne-iQ·r(0)\nr\nS\neiQ· (t)\n2π\n-inf\nif all nuclei are equivalent (same isotope), and the full dynamic structure\nD\nfactor\nE\nS(Q, ω) =\nZ inf\neiωfit\n*\nX\ne-iQ·rx(0)eiQ·ry(t)\n2π\n-inf\nN x,y\n+\nThe structure factors depend only on the material properties.
