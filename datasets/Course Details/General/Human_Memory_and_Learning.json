  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session\n\nOverview\n\nOther than that which is genetically coded, everything we know is derived from and reflects memory for our past experiences. Memory is intimately involved in most, if not all, levels of human cognition, from the ability to temporarily remember a phone number or where you placed your keys to the acquisition of language and the ability to reason. This lecture and seminar course will consider recent efforts to understand the cognitive and neural architectures of memory through application of functional neuroimaging methods (primarily fMRI and PET). Lectures will survey the literature on the cognitive neuroscience of memory. Subsequent group discussion will consider the neuroimaging literature within the context of cognitive theories of memory and functional neuroanatomic hypotheses. There are no prerequisites for this course.\n\nCourse Structure\n\nClasses will consist of a survey lectures followed by student presentation/group discussion of assigned readings. Lectures will consider the cognitive and neuroscientific literatures on the organization of memory, and on the application of neuroimaging to the study of memory. Discussion and student presentations will focus on the implications of recent neuroimaging investigations.\n\nText\n\nH. Eichenbaum, and N.J. Cohen.\nFrom Conditioning to Conscious Recollection\n. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\n30% for class participation. Both the Background and Imaging readings should be completed prior to class. Students should be prepared to contribute to the discussion of the neuroimaging articles.\n\n30% for paper presentations. Each student will briefly (20-30 minutes) present recent neuroimaging papers and will lead group discussion at multiple points during the term. The objectives of the presentation are to consider the motivation, methods, results, and implications of the article, serving to initiate the day's discussion of this and the related assigned articles.\n\n40% for an experimental research proposal. This proposal should advance a novel neuroimaging investigation aimed to address any aspect of memory considered during the course. The proposal (approx. 10-15 pages) should describe the background, experimental design, analysis approach, predicted results, and theoretical implications. Proposals will be due on the last day of class and will be briefly presented (~15 minutes) during the final class meeting.",

skill learning\n- Motor skill\n- Perceptual skill\n- Cognitive skill\n\nAcquisition of new behavioral abilities with practice\n\nContrast with repetition priming:\n\n- Repetition priming is defined as facilitation on a particular stimulus\n\n- Skill learning is defined as facilitation on a range of stimuli in a particular task\n\n1) Cognitive stage\n- Initial (often verbal) characterization of skill used to guide behavior\n- Requires working memory capacity\n\n2) Associative stage\n- Behavior becomes tuned, errors are eliminated\n- Verbal mediation drops out\n\n3) Autonomous stage\n- Gradual continued improvement of skill\n- Little reliance upon working memory\n\nSkill learning: associated with automatic (as opposed to controlled) processing\n\n- Less attention-demanding\n- Reduced interference with other ongoing processes or tasks\n- Reduced need for conscious control\n\nHowever, automaticity does not imply that behavior is uncontrollable\n- Many examples of skill (driving, reading, typing) are highly controllable, in that\nthey can be stopped at any time\n\nDecrease in response times with skill learning on a wide range of tasks can be described\nby a power function:\n\nRT = A + BN -β\n\nA=asymptote\nB=start-asymptote\n-β=learning rate\n\nProduction system model of memory\n- If-then rules triggered by contents of working memory\n\nLearning involves transition from declarative to procedural memory\n\nDeclarative stage:\n- Existing productions are chained together\n- Relevant information is held in working memory\n\nProcedural stage:\n- Multiple productions are chained into single productions with declarative\nknowledge built in\n→ decreases working memory requirements\n- New compiled productions are strengthened\n\nGoal: Type the word \"hot\"\nVariables: L1=h, L2=o, L3=t\nProductions:\n- If the goal is to type a word & the 1st letter of the word is L1,\n- Then type L1\n- If the goal is to type a word & the 2nd letter of the word is L2,\n- Then type L2\n- If the goal is to type a word & the 3rd letter of the word is L3,\n- Then type L3\n\nAfter practice, composition and proceduralization lead to the following production:\n- If the goal is to type \"hot\", type \"h\", \"o\", and \"t\"\n\nStrengths:\n- Makes detailed behavioral predictions\n- Predicts power function speedup\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Has primarily been applied to verbal cognitive tasks\n- Not clear that declarative-to-procedural transition is a valid descriptor of all types\nof skill acquisition\n\nInstance/exemplar-based memory\n- Each episode results in a memory trace containing the contents of attention\n- Each instance retrieves all similar traces from memory\n\nRace between memory and algorithm\n- Performance initially driven by algorithm (or analogy)\n- Memory retrieval time decreases as power function of number of instances stored in\nmemory\n- Memory retrieval soon comes to dominate performance\n- Even when average memory retrieval time is longer than algorithm time\n\nStrengths:\n- Predicts changing shape of response time distributions with learning\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Current incarnation only models response times\n- Does not make behavioral predictions\n\nSkill learning is tested in a number of domains\n- Motor skill\n- Perceptual skill\n- Cognitive skill\n\nNovel perceptual-motor mappings\n- Mirror-tracing\n- Prism adaptation\n\nNovel movement patterns / sequences\n- Rotary pursuit\n- Motor sequence learning\n\nMotor skill learning is usually intact in amnesia\n- Rotary pursuit\n- Mirror-tracing\n\n- Motor sequence learning\n\nBut motor skill learning is sometimes impaired in amnesia\n- Maze learning\n- Higher-order motor sequence learning\n- Exceptions may require higher-order relational or spatial learning\n\nOther forms are spared:\n\n- Mirror-tracing\n\nBG may play particular role in open-loop motor skills\n\nImaging shows increasing putamen activity with motor skill acquisition\n\nNeuropsychology:\n- cerebellar lesions sometimes impair motor learning\n- pattern tracing (Sanes, Dimitrov, & Hallett, 1990)\n\nImaging:\n- decreased cerebellar activation with acquisition of very simple motor tasks\n- cerebellar activation related to errors on motor tasks\n\nNeurophysiology:\n- Increased # of synapses in cerebellar cortex accompanies motor skill learning in\nrats (Greenough et al.)\n\nNeuropsychology:\n- Little evidence about role of cortex in memory for motor skills\n- SMA lesions impair SRT and tracking\n- Evaluation of role of motor cortex is difficult\n- Motor control impairments following cortical lesions\n- Cortical lesions are often large\n\nNeuroanatomy:\n- Size of motor cortex is correlated with long-term motor skill acquisition (Amunts et\nal., 1997)\n\nNeurophysiology:\n- changes in cortical maps with skill learning\n- areal expansion for trained movements\n\nNovel perceptual recognition skills\n- Mirror-reading\n\n- Low-level visual discrimination (e.g., vernier discrimination)\n\n- Object discrimination (e.g., Greebles)\n\nIntact mirror-reading\nin amnesia\n\nNeuropsychology:\n- HD patients mildly impaired at mirror-reading skill\n- PD patients are variably impaired\n- Some studies find severe impairment\n- Others find no impairment\n\nNeuroimaging:\n- Imaging shows learning-related changes in caudate\n\nFrontal, occipital, and cerebellar lesions do not impair mirror-reading\n\nCategorization learning\n- Probabilistic classification\n- Weather prediction task\n\nStrategic game learning\n- Tower of Hanoi\n- Learned using recursive subgoaling strategy\n\nTower of Hanoi\n- Amnesic patients are sometimes normal\n- Other studies have found impaired learning\n\nProbabilistic Classification\n- Amnesics show normal early learning\n- Seem to show impaired later learning\n\nTower of Hanoi\n- Learning intact following cerebellar lesions\n- Learning impaired in HD and PD\n\n- Learning impaired following frontal lesions\n\nProbabilistic classification learning\n- Learning impaired in PD and HD\n- Imaging shows activation of caudate nucleus which decreases with learning\n- Learning intact following frontal lesions\n\nSkill learning is (mostly) independent of MTL\n\nBasal ganglia are involved in a wide range of skills\n\nDifferent cortical regions important depending upon nature of skill\n\nCerebellum important for motor skills\n\nTwo ways that the brain changes during skill learning\n\n- Tuning of existing processes/representations\n- Existing representations are dynamically altered\n\n- Switching to new processes/representations\n- Task is performed in a completely different manner\n- May reflect race/competition between multiple processes"
