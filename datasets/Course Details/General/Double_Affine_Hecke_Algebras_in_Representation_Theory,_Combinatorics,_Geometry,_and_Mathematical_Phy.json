Introduction\nDouble affine Hecke algebras, also called Cherednik algebras, were introduced by Chered\nnik in 1993 as a tool in his proof of Macdonald's conjectures about orthogonal polynomials for\nroot systems. Since then, it has been realized that Cherednik algebras are of great indepen\ndent interest; they appeared in many different mathematical contexts and found numerous\napplications.\nThe present notes are based on a course on Cherednik algebras given by the first author\nat MIT in the Fall of 2009. Their goal is to give an introduction to Cherednik algebras, and\nto review the web of connections between them and other mathematical objects. For this\nreason, the notes consist of many parts that are relatively independent of each other. Also,\nto keep the notes within the bounds of a one-semester course, we had to limit the discussion\nof many important topics to a very brief outline, or to skip them altogether. For a more\nin-depth discussion of Cherednik algebras, we refer the reader to research articles dedicated\nto this subject.\nThe notes do not contain any original material. In each section, the sources of the expo\nsition are listed in the notes at the end of the section.\nThe organization of the notes is as follows.\nIn Section 2, we define the classical and quantum Calogero-Moser systems, and their\nanalogs for any Coxeter groups introduced by Olshanetsky and Perelomov. Then we intro\nduce Dunkl operators, prove the fundamental result of their commutativity, and use them to\nestablish integrability of the Calogero-Moser and Olshanetsky-Perelomov systems. We also\nprove the uniqueness of the first integrals for these systems.\nIn Section 3, we conceptualize the commutation relations between Dunkl operators and\ncoordinate operators by introducing the main object of these notes - the rational Cherednik\nalgebra. We develop the basic theory of rational Cherednik algebras (proving the PBW\ntheorem), and then pass to the representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras, more\nprecisely, study the structure of category O. After developing the basic theory (parallel to\nthe case of semisimple Lie algebras), we completely work out the representations in the rank\n1 case, and prove a number of results about finite dimensional representations and about\nrepresentations of the rational Cherednik algebra attached to the symmetric group.\nIn Section 4, we evaluate the Macdonald-Mehta integral, and then use it to find the sup\nports of irrieducible modules over the rational Cherednik algebras with the trivial lowest\nweight, in particular giving a simple proof of the theorem of Varagnolo and Vasserot, classi\nfying such representations which are finite dimensional.\nIn Section 5, we describe the theory of parabolic induction and restriction functors for\nrational Cherednik algebras, developed in [BE], and give some applications of this theory,\nsuch as the description of the category of Whittaker modules and of possible supports of\nmodules lying in category O.\nIn Section 6, we define Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups, and the Knizhnik-\nZamolodchikov (KZ) functor from the category O of a rational Cherednik algebra to the\ncategory of finite dimensional representations of the corresponding Hecke algebra. We use\nthis functor to prove the formal flatness of Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups (a\ntheorem of Brou e, Malle, and Rouquier), and state the theorem of Ginzburg-Guay-Opdam-\nRouquier that the KZ functor is an equivalence from the category O modulo its torsion part\nto the category of representations of the Hecke algebra.\n\nIn Section 7, we define rational Cherednik algebras for orbifolds. We also define the\ncorresponding Hecke algebras, and define the KZ functor from the category of modules over\nthe former to that over the latter. This generalizes to the \"curved\" case the KZ functor\nfor rational Cherednik algebras of complex reflection groups, defined in Section 6. We then\napply the KZ functor to showing that if the universal cover of the orbifold in question has\na trivial H2 (with complex coefficients), then the orbifold Hecke algebra is formally flat,\nand explain why the condition of trivial H2 cannot be dropped. Next, we list examples of\norbifold Hecke algebras which satisfy the condition of vanishing H2 (and hence are formally\nflat). These include usual, affine, and double affine Hecke algebras, as well as Hecke algebras\nattached to Fuchsian groups, which include quantizations of del Pezzo surfaces and their\nHilbert schemes; we work these examples out in some detail, highlighting connections with\nother subjects. Finally, we discuss the issue of algebraic flatness, and prove it in the case of\nalgebras of rank 1 attached to Fuchsian groups, using the theory of deformations of group\nalgebras of Coxeter groups developed in [ER].\nIn Section 8, we define symplectic reflection algebras (which inlude rational Cherednik al\ngebras as a special case), and generalize to them some of the theory of Section 3. Namely, we\nuse the theory of deformations of Koszul algebras to prove the PBW theorem for symplectic\nreflection algebras. We also determine the center of symplectic reflection algebras, showing\nthat it is trivial when the parameter t is nonzero, and is isomorphic to the shperical subal\ngebra if t = 0. Next, we give a deformation-theoretic interpretation of symplectic reflection\nalgebras as universal deformations of Weyl algebras smashed with finite groups. Finally, we\ndiscuss finite dimensional representations of symplectic reflection algebras for t = 0, show\ning that the Azumaya locus on the space of such representations coincides with the smooth\nlocus. This uses the theory of Cohen-Macaulay modules and of homological dimension in\ncommutative algebra. In particular, we show that for Cherednik algebras of type An-1, the\nwhole representation space is smooth and coincides with the spectrum of the center.\nIn Section 9, we give another description of the spectrum of the center of the rational\nCherednik algebra of type An-1 (for t = 0), as a certain space of conjugacy classes of pairs\nof matrices, introduced by Kazhdan, Kostant, and Sternberg, and called the Calogero-Moser\nspace (this space is obtained by classical hamiltonian reduction, and is a special case of a\nquiver variety). This yields a new construction of the Calogero-Moser integrable system.\nWe also sketch a proof of the Gan-Ginzburg theorem claiming that the quotient of the\ncommuting scheme by conjugation is reduced, and hence isomorphic to C2n/Sn. Finally, we\nexplain that the Calogero-Moser space is a topologically trivial deformation of the Hilbert\nscheme of the plane, we use the theory of Cherednik algebras to compute the cohomology\nring of this space.\nIn Section 10, we generalize the results of Section 9 to the quantum case. Namely, we\nprove the quantum analog of the Gan-Ginzburg theorem (the Harish Chandra-Levasseur-\nStafford theorem), and explain how to quantize the Calogero-Moser space using quantum\nHamiltonian reduction. Not surprisingly, this gives the same quantization as was constructed\nin the previous sections, namely, the spherical subalgebra of the rational Cherednik algebra.\nAcknowledgements.

The rational quantum Calogero-Moser system. Consider the differential operator\nn\nX ∂2\nX\nH =\ni=1 ∂xi\n2 - c(c + 1)\ni=\nj (xi - xj )2 .\nThis is the quantum Hamiltonian for a system of n particles on the line of unit mass and the\ninteraction potential (between particle 1 and 2) c(c + 1)/(x1 - x2)2 . This system is called\nthe rational quantum Calogero-Moser system.\nIt turns out that the rational quantum Calogero-Moser system is completely integrable.\nNamely, we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 2.1. There exist differential operators Lj with rational coefficients of the form\nn\nX ∂\nLj =\n(\n)j + lower order terms,\nj = 1, . . . , n,\n∂xi\ni=1\nwhich are invariant under the symmetric group Sn, homogeneous of degree -j, and such\nthat L2 = H and [Lj , Lk] = 0, ∀j, k = 1, . . . , n.\nWe will prove this theorem later.\nP ∂\nRemark 2.2. L1 =\ni\n.\n∂xi\n2.2. Complex reflection groups. Theorem 2.1 can be generalized to the case of any finite\nCoxeter group. To describe this generalization, let us recall the basic theory of finite Coxeter\ngroups and, more generally, complex reflection groups.\nLet h be a finite-dimensional complex vector space. We say that a semisimple element\ns ∈ GL(h) is a (complex) reflection if rank (1 - s) = 1. This means that s is conjugate to\nthe diagonal matrix diag(λ, 1, . . . , 1) where λ = 1.\nNow assume h carries a nondegenerate inner product (·, ). We say that a semisimple\n·\nelement s ∈ O(h) is a real reflection if rank (1 - s) = 1; equivalently, s is conjugate to\ndiag(-1, 1, . . . , 1).\nNow let G ⊂ GL(h) be a finite subgroup.\nDefinition 2.3.\n(i) We say that G is a complex reflection group if it is generated by\ncomplex reflections.\n(ii) If h carries an inner product, then a finite subgroup G ⊂ O(h) is a real reflection\ngroup (or a finite Coxeter group) if G is generated by real reflections.\nFor the complex reflection groups, we have the following important theorem.\nTheorem 2.4 (The Chevalley-Shepard-Todd theorem, [Che]). A finite subgroup G of GL(h)\nis a complex reflection group if and only if the algebra (Sh)G is a polynomial (i.e., free)\nalgebra.\nBy the Chevalley-Shepard-Todd theorem, the algebra (Sh)G has algebraically independent\ngenerators Pi, homogeneous of some degrees di for i = 1, . . . , dim h. The numbers di are\nuniquely determined, and are called the degrees of G.\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nX\ni\nExample 2.5. If G = Sn, h = Cn-1 (the space of vectors in Cn with zero sum of co\nordinates), then one can take Pi(p1, . . . , pn) = p i+1 +\n+ pi+1 , i = 1, . . . , n - 1 (where\nP\nn\n· · ·\npi = 0).\n2.3. Parabolic subgroups. Let G ⊂ GL(h) be a finite subgroup.\nDefinition 2.6. A parabolic subgroup of G is the stabilizer Ga of a point a ∈ h.\nNote that by Chevalley's theorem, a parabolic subgroup of a complex (respectively, real)\nreflection group is itself a complex (respectively, real) reflection group.\nAlso, if W is a real reflection group, then it can be shown that a subgroup W 0 ⊂ W is\nparabolic if and only if it is conjugate to a subgroup generated by a subset of simple reflections\nof W . In this case, the rank of W 0, i.e. the number of generating simple reflections, equals\nthe codimension of the space hW 0 .\nExample 2.7. Consider the Coxeter group of type E8. It has the Dynkin diagram:\n-\nThe parabolic subgroups will be Coxeter groups whose Dynkin diagrams are obtained by\ndeleting vertices from the above graph. In particular, the maximal parabolic subgroups are\nD7, A7, A1 × A6, A2 × A1 × A4, A4 × A3, D5 × A2, E6 × A1, E7.\nSuppose G0 ⊂ G is a parabolic subgroup, and b ∈ h is such that Gb = G0. In this case,\nwe have a natural G0-invariant decomposition h = hG0 ⊕ (h∗G0 )⊥, and b ∈ hG0 . Thus we have\na nonempty open set hG0 of all a ∈ hG0 for which Ga = G0; this set is nonempty because it\nreg\ncontains b. We also have a G0-invariant decomposition h∗ = h∗G0 ⊕ (hG0 )⊥, and we can define\nthe open set h∗G0 of all λ ∈ hG0 for which Gλ = G0. It is clear that this set is nonempty. This\nreg\nimplies, in particular, that one can make an alternative definition of a parabolic subgroup\nof G as the stabilizer of a point in h∗.\n2.4. Olshanetsky-Perelomov operators. Let s ⊂ GL(h) be a complex reflection. Denote\nby αs ∈ h∗ an eigenvector in h∗ of s with nontrivial eigenvalue.\nLet W ⊂ O(h) be a real reflection group and S ⊂ W the set of reflections. Clearly, W\nacts on S by conjugation. Let c : S → C be a conjugation invariant function.\nDefinition 2.8. [OP] The quantum Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonian attached to W is\nthe second order differential operator\nH := Δh -\ns∈S\n(cs\ncs\n+ 1)(αs,\nα2\ns\nαs) ,\nwhere Δh is the Laplace operator on h.\nHere we use the inner product on h∗ which is dual to the inner product on h.\nLet us assume that h is an irreducible representation of W (i.e. W is an irreducible finite\nCoxeter group, and h is its reflection representation.) In this case, we can take P1(p) = p2 .\nTheorem 2.9. The system defined by the Olshanetsky-Perelomov operator H is completely\nintegrable. Namely, there exist differential operators Lj on h with rational coefficients and\nsymbols Pj , such that Lj are homogeneous (of degree -dj ), L1 = H, and [Lj , Lk] = 0, ∀j, k.\n\nX\nThis theorem is obviously a generalization of Theorem 2.1 about W = Sn.\nTo prove Theorem 2.9, one needs to develop the theory of Dunkl operators.\nRemark 2.10. 1. We will show later that the operators Lj are unique.\n2. Theorem 2.9 for classical root systems was proved by Olshanetsky and Perelomov\n(see [OP]), following earlier work of Calogero, Sutherland, and Moser in type A. For a\ngeneral Weyl group, this theorem (in fact, its stronger trigonometric version) was proved by\nanalytic methods in the series of papers [HO],[He3],[Op3],[Op4]. A few years later, a simple\nalgebraic proof using Dunkl operators, which works for any finite Coxeter group, was found\nby Heckman, [He1]; this is the proof we will give below.\nFor the trigonometric version, Heckman also gave an algebraic proof in [He2], which used\nnon-commuting trigonometric counterparts of Dunkl operators. This proof was later im\nproved by Cherednik ([Ch1]), who defined commuting (although not Weyl group invariant)\nversions of Heckman's trigonometric Dunkl operators, now called Dunkl-Cherednik opera\ntors.\n2.5. Dunkl operators. Let G ⊂ GL(h) be a finite subgroup. Let S be the set of reflections\nin G. For any reflection s ∈S, let λs be the eigenvalue of s on αs ∈ h∗ (i.e. sαs = λsαs),\nand let α∨∈ h be an eigenvector such that sα∨= λ-1α∨. We normalize them in such a way\ns\ns\ns\ns\nthat hαs, α∨\ns i = 2.\nLet c : S → C be a function invariant with respect to conjugation. Let a ∈ h.\nThe following definition was made by Dunkl for real reflection groups, and by Dunkl and\nOpdam for complex reflection groups.\nDefinition 2.11. The Dunkl operator Da = Da(c) on C(h) is defined by the formula\nX 2csαs(a)\nDa = Da(c) := ∂a -\n(1 - λs)αs\n(1 - s).\ns∈S\nClearly, Da ∈ CG n D(hreg), where hreg is the set of regular points of h (i.e. not preserved\nby any reflection), and D(hreg) denotes the algebra of differential operators on hreg.\nExample 2.12. Let G = Z2, h = C. Then there is only one Dunkl operator up to scaling,\nand it equals to\nc\nD = ∂x - (1 - s),\nx\nwhere the operator s is given by the formula (sf)(x) = f(-x).\nRemark 2.13. The Dunkl operators Da map the space of polynomials C[h] to itself.\nProposition 2.14.\n(i) For any x ∈ h∗, one has\n[Da, x] = (a, x) -\ncs(a, αs)(x, α∨)s.\ns\ns∈S\n(ii) If g ∈ G then gDag-1 = Dga.\nProof. (i) The proof follows immediately from the identity\nx - sx = 1 - λs (x, α∨)αs.\ns\n(ii) The identity is obvious from the invariance of the function c.\n\nX\nP\nX\nThe main result about Dunkl operators, on which all their applications are based, is the\nfollowing theorem.\nTheorem 2.15 (C. Dunkl, [Du1]). The Dunkl operators commute:\n[Da, Db] = 0 for any a, b ∈ h.\nProof. Let x ∈ h∗. We have\n[[Da, Db], x] = [[Da, x], Db] - [[Db, x], Da].\nNow, using Proposition 2.14, we obtain:\n[[Da, x], Db]\n= -[\ncs(a, αs)(x, α∨\ns )s, Db]\ns∈S\n= -\nX\ncs(a, αs)(x, αs\n∨)(b, αs)sDα∨\ns · 1 -\nλ-\ns\n.\ns∈S\nSince a and b occur symmetrically, we obtain that [[Da, Db], x] = 0. This means that for any\nf\nf ∈ C[h], [Da, Db]f = f[Da, Db]1 = 0. So for f, g ∈ C[h], g ·[Da, Db] g = [Da, Db]f = 0. Thus\nf\n[Da, Db]\n= 0 which implies [Da, Db] = 0 in the algebra CG n D(hreg) (since this algebra\ng\nacts faithfully on C(h)).\n\n2.6. Proof of Theorem 2.9. For any element B ∈ CW n D(hreg), define m(B) to be the\ndifferential operator C(h)W\nC(h), defined by B. That is, if B =\n),\nP\n→\ng∈W Bgg, Bg ∈D(hreg\nthen m(B) =\ng∈W Bg. It is clear that if B is W -invariant, then ∀A ∈ CW n D(hreg),\nm(AB) = m(A)m(B).\nProposition 2.16 ([Du1], [He1]). Let {y1, . . . , yr} be an orthonormal basis of h. Then we\nhave\nr\nm(\nDy\ni ) = H,\ni=1\nP\ncs(αs, αs)\nwhere H = Δh -\n∂α∨.\ns\ns∈S\nαs\nProof. For any y ∈ h, we have m(Dy\n2) = m(Dy∂y). A simple computation shows that\nDy∂y = ∂y\n2 -\nX csα\nα\ns\ns\n(y)(1 - s)∂y\ns∈S\n= ∂y\n2 -\nX csαs(y)(∂y(1 - s) + αs(y)∂α∨s).\nαs\ns\ns∈S\nThis means that\nm(Dy\n2) = ∂y\n2 -\nX csα\nα\ns(\ns\ny)2\n∂α∨.\ns\ns∈S\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nQ\nQ\nSo we get\nm(\nr\nDy\ni ) =\nr\n∂y\ni -\ncs\nr\nαs\nα\n(y\ns\ni)2\n∂αs∨= H,\nP\ni=1\ni=1\ns∈S\ni=1\nsince\nr\ni=1 αs(yi)2 = (αs, αs).\n\nRecall that by the Chevalley-Shepard-Todd theorem, the algebra (Sh)W is free. Let P1 =\np2, P2, . . . , Pr be homogeneous generators of (Sh)W .\nCorollary 2.17. The differential operators Lj = m(Pj (Dy1 , . . . , Dyr )) are pairwise commu\ntative, have symbols Pj , homogeneity degree -dj , and L1 = H.\nProof. Since Dunkl operators commute, the operators Lj are well defined. Since m(AB) =\nm(A)m(B) when B is invariant, the operators Lj are pairwise commutative. The rest is\nclear.\n\nNow to prove Theorem 2.9, we will show that the operators H and H are conjugate to\neach other by a certain function; this will complete the proof.\nProposition 2.18. Let δc(x) :=\nαs(x)cs . Then we have\ns∈S\nδ-1\nH\nδc = H.\nc *\n*\nRemark 2.19. The function δc(x) is not rational. It is a multivalued analytic function.\nNevertheless, it is easy to see that for any differential operator L with rational coefficients,\nδc\n-1\nL\nδc also has rational coefficients.\n*\n*\nProof of Proposition 2.18. We have\nr\nX\nX cs(αs, αs)\n∂yi (log δc)∂yi =\ns .\n∂α∨\n2αs\ni=1\ns∈S\nTherefore, we have\nδc * H\nδc\n-1 = Δh -\nX cs(αs, αs)\ns + U,\n*\nαs\n∂α∨\ns∈S\nwhere\nU = δc(Δhδ-1\nX cs(cs + 1)(αs, αs) .\nc ) -\nα2\ns∈S\ns\nLet us compute U. We have\nX cs(cs + 1)(αs, αs)\nX cscu(αs, αu)\nδc(Δhδc\n-1) =\nα2\n+\n.\ns\nαsαu\ns∈S\ns6=u∈S\nWe claim that the last sum Σ is actually zero. Indeed, this sum is invariant under the Coxeter\ngroup, so\ns∈S αs · Σ is a regular anti-invariant function of degree |S| - 2. But the smallest\ndegree of a nonzero anti-invariant is |S|, so Σ = 0, U = 0, and we are done (Proposition 2.18\nand Theorem 2.9 are proved).\n\nRemark 2.20. A similar method works for any complex reflection group G. Namely, the\noperators Li = m(Pi(Dy1 , . . . , Dyr )) form a quantum integrable system. However, if G is not\na real reflection group, this system does not have a quadratic Hamiltonian in momentum\nvariables (so it does not have a physical meaning).\n\n2.7. Uniqueness of the operators Lj.\nProposition 2.21. The operators Lj are unique.\nProof. Assume that we have two choices for Lj : Lj and L0\nj. Denote Lj - L0\nj by M.\nAssume M = 0. We have\n(i) M is a differential operator on h with rational coefficients, of order smaller than dj\nand homogeneity degree -dj ;\n(ii) [M, H] = 0.\nLet M0 be the symbol of M. Then M0 is a polynomial of p ∈ h∗ with coefficients in C(h).\nWe have, from (ii),\n{M0, p 2} = 0,\n∀p ∈ h∗,\nand from (i) we see that the coefficients of M0 are not polynomial (as they have negative\ndegree).\nHowever, we have the following lemma.\nLemma 2.22. Let h be a finite dimensional vector space. Let ψ : (x, p) 7→ ψ(x, p) be a\nrational function on h ⊕ h∗ which is a polynomial in p ∈ h∗. Let f : h∗ → C be a polynomial\nsuch that the differentials df(p) for p ∈ h∗ span h (e.g., f(p) = p2). Suppose that the\nPoisson bracket of f and ψ vanishes: {ψ, f} = 0. Then ψ is a polynomial.\nProof. (R. Raj) Let Z ⊂ h be the pole divisor of ψ. Let x0 ∈ h be a generic point in Z. Then\nψ-1 is regular and vanishes at (x0, p) for generic p ∈ h∗. Also from {ψ-1, f} = 0, we have\nψ-1 vanishes along the entire flowline of the Hamiltonian flow defined by f and starting at\nx0. This flowline is defined by the formula\nx(t) = x0 + tdf(p),\np(t) = p,\nand it must be contained in the pole divisor of ψ near x0. This implies that df(p) must be\nin Tx0 Z for almost every, hence for every p ∈ h∗. This is a contradiction with the assumption\non f, which implies that in fact ψ has no poles.\n\n2.8. Classical Dunkl operators and Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonians. We con\ntinue to use the notations in Section 2.4.\nDefinition 2.23. The classical Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonian corresponding to W is\nthe following classical Hamiltonian on hreg × h∗ = T ∗hreg:\nX c2(αs, αs)\nH0(x, p) = p 2 -\ns\nαs\n2(x) .\ns∈S\nTheorem 2.24 ([OP],[HO, He3, Op3, Op4],[He1]). The Hamiltonian H0 defines a classical\nintegrable system. Namely, there exist unique regular functions L0 on hreg ×h∗, where highest\nj\nterms in p are Pj , such that L0 are homogeneous of degree -dj (under x 7→ λx, x ∈ h∗, p 7→\nj\nλ-1p, p ∈ h), and such that L0 = H0 and {L0\nj , Lk\n0 } = 0, ∀j, k.\nProof. The proof is given in the next subsection.\n\nX\nX\nP\nP\nX\nExample 2.25. Let W = Sn, h = Cn-1 . Then\nn\nX\nX\nH0 =\np 2\ni - c 2\n(xi - xj )2\n( the classical Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian).\ni=1\ni=j\nSo the theorem says that there are functions L0\nj , j = 1, . . . , n - 1,\nL0\nj =\npi\nj+1 + lower terms,\ni\nhomogeneous of degree zero, such that L0 = H0 and {L0, Lk\n0 } = 0.\nj\n2.9. Rees algebras. Let A be a filtered algebra over a field k: k = F 0A ⊂ F 1A ⊂ · · · ,\n∪iF iA = A. Then the Rees algebra A = Rees(A) is defined by the formula A = ⊕inf\nn=0F nA.\nThis is an algebra over k[~], where ~ is the element 1 of the summand F 1A.\n2.10. Proof of Theorem 2.24. The proof of Theorem 2.24 is similar to the proof of its\nquantum analog. Namely, to construct the functions Lj\n0 , we need to introduce classical\nDunkl operators. To do so, we introduce a parameter ~ (Planck's constant) and define\nDunkl operators Da(~) = Da(c, ~) with ~:\nDa(c, ~) = ~Da(c/~) = ~∂a -\nX\n(1\n2c\n-\nsα\nλ\ns\ns\n(\n)\na\nα\n)\ns\n(1 - s), where a ∈ h.\ns∈S\nThese operators can be regarded as elements of the Rees algebra A = Rees(CW n D(hreg)),\nwhere the filtration is by order of differential operators (and W sits in degree 0). Reducing\nthese operators modulo ~, we get classical Dunkl operators Da\n0(c) ∈ A0 := A/~A = CW n\nO(T ∗hreg). They are given by the formula\nD0(c) = pa -\nX\n(1\n2c\n-\nsα\nλ\ns\ns\n(\n)\na\nα\n)\ns\n(1 - s),\na\ns∈S\nwhere pa is the classical momentum (the linear function on h∗ corresponding to a ∈ h).\nIt follows from the commutativity of the quantum Dunkl operators Da(c) that the Dunkl\noperators Da(c, ~) commute. Hence, so do the classical Dunkl operators Da\n0:\n[Da\n0, Db\n0] = 0.\nWe also have the following analog of Proposition 2.14:\nProposition 2.26.\n(i) For any x ∈ h∗, one has\n[Da\n0 , x] = -\ncs(a, αs)(x, αs\n∨)s.\ns∈S\n(ii) If g ∈ W then gD0g-1 = D0 .\na\nga\nNow let us construct the classical Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonians. As in the quan\ntum case, we have the operation m(·), which is given by the formula\ng∈W Bg · g 7→\nBg,\nB ∈O(T ∗hreg). We define the Hamiltonian\nr\nH0 := m(\n(Dy\ni )2).\ni=1\n\nBy taking the limit of quantum situation, we find\nX cs(αs, αs)\n= p\n.\nH0\n2 -\nαs(x) pα∨\ns\ns∈S\nUnfortunately, this is no longer conjugate to H0. However, consider the (outer) automor\nphism θc of the algebra CW n O(T ∗hreg) defined by the formulas\nθc(x) = x, θc(s) = s, θc(pa) = pa + ∂a log δc,\nfor x ∈ h∗, a ∈ h, s ∈ W . It is easy to see that if b0 ∈ A0 and b ∈ A is a deformation of\nb0 then θc(b0) = lim~\nc/~bδc/~. Therefore, taking the limit ~\n0 in Proposition 2.16, we\n0 δ-1\n→\n→\nfind that H0 = θc(H0).\nNow set Lj\n0 = m(θc(Pj (Dy\n1 , . . . , Dy\nr ))). These functions are well defined since Da\n0 com\nmute, are homogeneous of degree zero, and L0\n1 = H0.\nMoreover, we can define the operators Lj (~) in Rees(D(hreg)W ) in the same way as Lj , but\nusing the Dunkl operators Dyi (~) instead of Dyi . Then [Lj (~), Lk(~)] = 0, and Lj (~) ~=0 =\nL0\nj . This implies that L0 Poisson commute: {L0, Lk\n0} = 0.\n|\nj\nj\nTheorem 2.24 is proved.\nRemark 2.27. As in the quantum situation, Theorem 2.24 can be generalized to complex\nreflection groups, giving integrable systems with Hamiltonians which are non-quadratic in\nmomentum variables.\n2.11. Notes. Section 2.1 follows Section 5.4 of [E4]; the definition of complex reflection\ngroups and their basic properties can be found in [GM]; the definition of parabolic subgroups\nand the notations are borrowed from Section 3.1 of [BE]; the remaining parts of this section\nfollow Section 6 of [E4].\n\nX\nY\nY\nY\nY\n3. The rational Cherednik algebra\n3.1. Definition and examples. Above we have made essential use of the commutation\nrelations between operators x ∈ h∗, g ∈ G, and Da, a ∈ h. This makes it natural to consider\nthe algebra generated by these operators.\nDefinition 3.1. The rational Cherednik algebra associated to (G, h) is the algebra Hc(G, h)\ngenerated inside A = Rees(CG n D(hreg)) by the elements x ∈ h∗, g ∈ G, and Da(c, ~), a ∈ h.\nIf t ∈ C, then the algebra Ht,c(G, h) is the specialization of Hc(G, h) at ~ = t.\nProposition 3.2. The algebra Hc is the quotient of the algebra CG n T(h ⊕ h∗)[~] (where\nT denotes the tensor algebra) by the ideal generated by the relations\n[x, x0] = 0, [y, y0] = 0, [y, x] = ~(y, x) -\ncs(y, αs)(x, α∨)s,\ns\ns∈S\nwhere x, x0 ∈ h∗, y, y0 ∈ h.\nProof. Let us denote the algebra defined in the proposition by Hc\n0 = Hc\n0(G, h). Then accord\ning to the results of the previous sections, we have a surjective homomorphism φ : Hc\nHc\ndefined by the formula φ(x) = x, φ(g) = g, φ(y) = Dy(c, ~).\n→\nLet us show that this homomorphism is injective. For this purpose assume that yi is a\nbasis of h, and xi is the dual basis of h∗. Then it is clear from the relations of Hc\n0 that Hc\n0 is\nspanned over C[~] by the elements\nr\nr\n(3.1)\ng\nyi\nmi\nxi\nni .\ni=1\ni=1\nThus it remains to show that the images of the elements (3.1) under the map φ, i.e. the\nelements\nr\nr\ng\nDyi (c, ~)mi\nxi\nni .\ni=1\ni=1\nare linearly independent. But this follows from the obvious fact that the symbols of these\nelements in CG n C[h∗ × hreg][~] are linearly independent. The proposition is proved.\n\nRemark 3.3. 1. Similarly, one can define the universal algebra H(G, h), in which both ~\nand c are variables. (So this is an algebra over C[~, c].) It has two equivalent definitions\nsimilar to the above.\n2. It is more convenient to work with algebras defined by generators and relations than\nwith subalgebras of a given algebra generated by a given set of elements. Therefore, from\nnow on we will use the statement of Proposition 3.2 as a definition of the rational Cherednik\nalgebra Hc. According to Proposition 3.2, this algebra comes with a natural embedding\nΘc : Hc → Rees(CG n D(hreg)), defined by the formula x → x, g → g, y → Dy(c, ~). This\nembedding is called the Dunkl operator embedding.\nExample 3.4. 1. Let G = Z2, h = C. In this case c reduces to one parameter, and the\nalgebra Ht,c is generated by elements x, y, s with defining relations\ns 2 = 1, sx = -xs, sy = -ys, [y, x] = t - 2cs.\n\nX\nP\n2. Let G = Sn, h = Cn . In this case there is also only one complex parameter c, and the\nalgebra Ht,c is the quotient of Sn n Chx1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yni by the relations\n[xi, xj ] = [yi, yj ] = 0, [yi, xj ] = csij , [yi, xi] = t - c\nsij .\nj=i\nHere ChEi denotes the free algebra on a set E, and sij is the transposition of i and j.\n3.2. The PBW theorem for the rational Cherednik algebra. Let us put a filtration\non Hc by setting deg y = 1 for y ∈ h and deg x = deg g = 0 for x ∈ h∗, g ∈ G. Let gr(Hc)\ndenote the associated graded algebra of Hc under this filtration, and similarly for Ht,c. We\nhave a natural surjective homomorphism\nξ : CG n C[h ⊕ h∗][~] → gr(Hc).\nFor t ∈ C, it specializes to surjective homomorphisms\nξt : CG n C[h ⊕ h∗] → gr(Ht,c).\nProposition 3.5 (The PBW theorem for rational Cherednik algebras). The maps ξ and ξt\nare isomorphisms.\nProof. The statement is equivalent to the claim that the elements (3.1) are a basis of Ht,c,\nwhich follows from the proof of Proposition 3.2.\n\nRemark 3.6. 1. We have\nH0,0 = CG n C[h ⊕ h∗] and H1,0 = CG n D(h).\n2. For any λ ∈ C∗, the algebra Ht,c is naturally isomorphic to Hλt,λc.\n3. The Dunkl operator embedding Θc specializes to embeddings\nΘ0,c : H0,c ,→ CG n C[h∗ × hreg],\ngiven by x 7→ x, g 7→ g, y 7→ D0, and\na\nΘ1,c : H1,c ,→ CG n D(hreg),\ngiven by x 7→ x, g 7→ g, y 7→ Da. So H0,c is generated by x, g, D0, and H1,c is generated by\na\nx, g, Da.\nSince Dunkl operators map polynomials to polynomials, the map Θ1,c defines a represen\ntation of H1,c on C[h]. This representation is called the polynomial representation of H1,c.\n3.3. The spherical subalgebra. Let e ∈ CG be the symmetrizer, e = |G|-1\ng∈G g. We\nhave e 2 = e.\nDefinition 3.7. Bc := eHce is called the spherical subalgebra of Hc. The spherical subalgebra\nof Ht,c is Bt,c := Bc/(~ - t) = eHt,ce.\nNote that\ne (CG n D(hreg)) e = D(hreg)G ,\ne (CG n C[hreg × h∗]) e = C[hreg × h∗]G .\nTherefore, the restriction gives the embeddings: Θ1,c : B1,c\n)G, and Θ0,c : B0,c ,\nC[h∗ × hreg]G . In particular, we have\n,→D(hreg\n→\nProposition 3.8. The spherical subalgebra B0,c is commutative and does not have zero\ndivisors. Also B0,c is finitely generated.\n\nProof. The first statement is clear from the above. The second statement follows from the\nfact that gr(B0,c) = B0,0 = C[h × h∗]G, which is finitely generated by Hilbert's theorem.\nCorollary 3.9. Mc = SpecB0,c is an irreducible affine algebraic variety.\nProof. Directly from the definition and the proposition.\n\nWe also obtain\nProposition 3.10. Bc is a flat quantization (non-commutative deformation) of B0,c over\nC[~].\nSo B0,c carries a Poisson bracket {·, ·}(thus Mc is a Poisson variety), and Bc is a quanti\nzation of the Poisson bracket, i.e. if a, b ∈ Bc and a0, b0 are the corresponding elements in\nB0,c, then\n[a, b]/~ ≡{a0, b0} (mod ~).\nDefinition 3.11. The Poisson variety Mc is called the Calogero-Moser space of G, h with\nparameter c.\n3.4. The localization lemma. Let Hloc = Ht,c[δ-1] be the localization of Ht,c as a module\nt,c\nover C[h] with respect to the discriminant δ (a polynomial vanishing to the first order on\neach reflection plane). Define also Bloc = eHloc e.\nt,c\nt,c\nProposition 3.12.\n(i) For t = 0 the map Θt,c induces an isomorphism of algebras\nHloc\n), which restricts to an isomorphism Bloc\n)G .\nt,c → CG n D(hreg\nt,c →D(hreg\n(ii) The map Θ0,c induces an isomorphism of algebras Hloc → CG n C[h∗ × hreg], which\n0,c\nrestricts to an isomorphism Bloc\n]G .\n0,c → C[h∗ × hreg\nProof. This follows immediately from the fact that the Dunkl operators have poles only on\nthe reflection hyperplanes.\n\nSince gr(B0,c) = B0,0 = C[h∗ ⊕ h]G, we get the following geometric corollary.\nCorollary 3.13.\n(i) The family of Poisson varieties Mc is a flat deformation of the\nPoisson variety M0 := (h × h∗)/G. In particular, Mc is smooth outside of a subset of\ncodimension 2.\n(ii) We have a natural map βc : Mc\nh/G, such that βc\n-1(hreg/G) is isomorphic to\n→\n(hreg ×h∗)/G. The Poisson structure on Mc is obtained by extension of the symplectic\nPoisson structure on (hreg × h∗)/G.\nExample 3.14. Let W = Z2, h = C. Then B0,c = hx2, xp, p2 -c2/x2i. Let X := x2, Z := xp\nand Y := p2 -c2/x2 . Then Z2 - XY = c2 . So Mc is isomorphic to the quadric Z2 -XY = c2\nin the 3-dimensional space and it is smooth for c = 0.\n3.5. Category O for rational Cherednik algebras. From the PBW theorem, we see that\nH1,c = Sh∗ ⊗ CG ⊗ Sh. It is similar to the structure of the universal enveloping algebra of a\nsimple Lie algebra: U(g) = U(n-)⊗U(h)⊗U(n+). Namely, the subalgebra CG plays the role\nof the Cartan subalgebra, and the subalgebras Sh∗ and Sh play the role of the positive and\nnegative nilpotent subalgebras. This similarity allows one to define and study the category\nO analogous to the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category O for simple Lie algebras.\n\nM\nDefinition 3.15. The category Oc(G, h) is the category of modules over H1,c(G, h) which\nare finitely generated over Sh∗ and locally finite under Sh (i.e., for M ∈Oc(G, h), ∀v ∈ M,\n(Sh)v is finite dimensional).\nIf M is a locally finite (Sh)G-module, then\nM = ⊕λ∈h∗/GMλ,\nwhere\nMλ = {v ∈ M|∀p ∈ (Sh)G , ∃N s.t. (p - λ(p))N v = 0},\n(notice that h∗/G = Specm(Sh)G).\nProposition 3.16. Mλ are H1,c-submodules.\nProof. Note first that we have an isomorphism μ : H1,c(G, h) ∼H1,c\n=\n(G, h∗), which is given\nby xa\nNow let x1, . . . , xr be a basis of h∗ and y1, . . . , yr a basis of h.\n7→ ya, yb 7→ -xb, g 7→ g.\nSuppose P = P (x1, . . . , xr) ∈ (Sh∗)G . Then we have\n∂\n[y, P ] = ∂y P ∈ Sh∗, where y ∈ h,\n(this follows from the fact that both sides act in the same way in the polynomial represen\ntation, which is faithful). So using the isomorphism μ, we conclude that if Q ∈ (Sh)G, Q =\nQ(y1, . . . , yr), then [x, Q] = -∂xQ for x ∈ h∗.\nNow, to prove the proposition, the only thing we need to check is that Mλ is invariant\nunder x ∈ h∗. For any v ∈ Mλ, we have (Q - λ(Q))N v = 0 for some N. Then\n(Q - λ(Q))N+1 xv = (N + 1)∂xQ (Q - λ(Q))N v = 0.\n·\nSo xv ∈ Mλ.\nCorollary 3.17. We have the following decomposition:\nOc(G, h) =\nOc(G, h)λ,\nλ∈h∗/G\nwhere Oc(G, h)λ is the subcategory of modules where (Sh)G acts with generalized eigenvalue\nλ.\nProof. Directly from the definition and the proposition.\n\nNote that Oc(G, h)λ is an abelian category closed under taking subquotients and exten\nsions.\n3.6. The grading element. Let\nX\nX 2cs\n(3.2)\nh =\nxiyi + 2 dim h -\n1 - λs\ns.\ni\ns∈S\nProposition 3.18. We have\n[h, x] = x, x ∈ h∗,\n[h, y] = -y, y ∈ h.\n\nX\nX\nP\nProof. Let us prove the first relation; the second one is proved similarly. We have\n[h, x]\n=\nX\nxi[yi, x] -\nX\n-\ncs\nλs\n· λs\n- 1(α∨, x)αs · s\ns\ni\nX\ns∈S\nX\n=\nxi(yi, x) -\n(α∨, x)(αs, yi)s +\n(α∨, x)αs · s.\nxi\ncs\ns\ncs\ns\ni\ni\nP\ns∈S\nP\ns∈S\nThe last two terms cancel since\ni xi(αs, yi) = αs, so we get\ni xi(yi, x) = x.\n\nProposition 3.19. Let G = W be a real reflection group. Let\nX\nX\n1 X\n1 X\nh =\nxiyi +\ndim h -\ncss,\nE = -\nxi\n2 ,\nF =\nyi\n2 .\ni\ni\ni\ns∈S\nThen\n(i) h =\ni(xiyi + yixi)/2;\n(ii) h, E, F form an sl2-triple.\nProof. A direct calculation.\n\nTheorem 3.20. Let M be a module over H1,c(G, h).\n(i) If h acts locally nilpotently on M, then h acts locally finitely on M.\n(ii) If M is finitely generated over Sh∗, then M ∈Oc(G, h)0 if and only if h acts locally\nfinitely on M.\nProof. (i) Assume that Sh acts locally nilpotently on M. Let v ∈ M. Then Sh v is a finite\n·\ndimensional vector space and let d = dim Sh v. We prove that v is h-finite by induction\n·\nin dimension d. We can use d = 0 as base, so only need to do the induction step. The\nspace Sh v must contain a nonzero vector u such that y\nu = 0, ∀y ∈ h. Let U ⊂ M be\n·\n·\nthe subspace of vectors with this property. h acts on U by an element of CG, hence locally\nfinitely. So it is sufficient to show that the image of v in M/hUi is h-finite (where hUi is\nthe submodule generated by U). But this is true by the induction assumption, as u = 0 in\nM/hUi.\n(ii) We need to show that if h acts locally finitely on M, then h acts locally nilpotently\non M. Assume h acts locally finitely on M. Then M = ⊕β∈B M[β], where B ⊂ C. Since M\nis finitely generated over Sh∗, B is a finite union of sets of the form z + Z≥0, z ∈ C. So Sh\nmust act locally nilpotently on M.\n\nWe can obtain the following corollary easily.\nCorollary 3.21. Any finite dimensional H1,c(G, h)-module is in Oc(G, h)0.\nWe see that any module M ∈Oc(G, h)0 has a grading by generalized eigenvalues of h:\nM = ⊕β M[β].\n3.7. Standard modules. Let τ be a finite dimensional representation of G. The standard\nmodule over H1,c(G, h) corresponding to τ (also called the Verma module) is\nMc(G, h, τ) = Mc(τ ) = H1,c(G, h) ⊗CGnSh τ ∈Oc(G, h)0,\nwhere Sh acts on τ by zero.\nSo from the PBW theorem, we have that as vector spaces, Mc(τ) ∼= τ ⊗ Sh∗.\n\nRemark 3.22. More generally, ∀λ ∈ h∗, let Gλ = Stab(λ), and τ be a finite dimensional\nrepresentation of Gλ. Then we can define Mc,λ(G, h, τ) = H1,c(G, h) ⊗CGλnSh τ, where Sh\nacts on τ by λ. These modules are called the Whittaker modules.\nLet τ be irreducible, and let hc(τ) be the number given by the formula\ndim h\nX 2cs\nhc(τ) =\n-\n1 - λs\ns|τ .\ns∈S\nThen we see that h acts on τ ⊗ Smh∗ by the scalar hc(τ) + m.\nDefinition 3.23. A vector v in an H1,c-module M is singular if yiv = 0 for all i.\nProposition 3.24. Let U be an H1,c(G, h)-module. Let τ ⊂ U be a G-submodule consisting\nof singular vectors. Then there is a unique homomorphism φ : Mc(τ )\nU of C[h]-modules\n→\nsuch that φ|τ is the identity, and it is an H1,c-homomorphism.\nProof. The first statement follows from the fact that Mc(τ) is a free module over C[h] gen\nerated by τ. Also, it follows from the Frobenius reciprocity that there must exist a map φ\nwhich is an H1,c-homomorphism. This implies the proposition.\n\n3.8. Finite length.\nProposition 3.25. ∃K ∈ R such that for any M ⊂ N in Oc(G, h)0, if M[β] = N[β] for\nRe (β) ≤ K, then M = N.\nProof. Let K = maxτ Re hc(τ). Then if M = N, M/N begins in degree β0 with Re β0 > K,\nwhich is impossible since by Proposition 3.24, β0 must equal hc(τ) for some τ.\n\nCorollary 3.26. Any M ∈Oc(G, h)0 has finite length.\nProof. Directly from the proposition.\n\n3.9. Characters. For M ∈Oc(G, h)0, define the character of M as the following formal\nseries in t:\nX\nch M (g, t) =\ntβTr M[β](g) = Tr M (gth),\ng ∈ G.\nβ\nProposition 3.27. We have\nχτ (g)thc(τ )\nch Mc(τ)(g, t) =\n.\ndeth∗ (1 - tg)\nProof. We begin with the following lemma.\nLemma 3.28 (MacMahon's Master theorem). Let V be a finite dimensional space, A : V →\nV a linear operator. Then\nX\ntnTr (SnA) =\n.\nn≥0\ndet(1 - tA)\nProof of the lemma. If A is diagonalizable, this is obvious. The general statement follows by\ncontinuity.\n\nThe lemma implies that Tr Sh∗ (gtD) =\nwhere D is the degree operator. This\ndet(1 - gt)\nimplies the required statement.\n\n( (\n?\n3.10. Irreducible modules. Let τ be an irreducible representation of G.\nProposition 3.29. Mc(τ) has a maximal proper submodule Jc(τ).\nProof. The proof is standard. Jc(τ) is the sum of all proper submodules of Mc(τ), and it is\nnot equal to Mc(τ) because any proper submodule has a grading by generalized eigenspaces\nof h, with eigenvalues β such that β - hc(τ) > 0.\n\nWe define Lc(τ) = Mc(τ )/Jc(τ), which is an irreducible module.\nProposition 3.30. Any irreducible object of Oc(G, h)0 has the form Lc(τ) for an unique τ.\nProof. Let L ∈Oc(G, h)0 be irreducible, with lowest eigenspace of h containing an irreducible\nG-module τ. Then by Proposition 3.24, we have a nonzero homomorphism Mc(τ)\nL, which\nis surjective, since L is irreducible. Then we must have L = Lc(τ).\n→\n\nRemark 3.31. Let χ be a character of G. Then we have an isomorphism H1,c(G, h) →\nH1,cχ(G, h), mapping g ∈ G to χ-1(g)g. This automorphism maps Lc(τ) to Lcχ(χ-1 ⊗ τ)\nisomorphically.\n3.11. The contragredient module. Set c(s) = c(s-1). We have a natural isomorphism\nγ : H1,c (G, h∗)op → H1,c(G, h), acting trivially on h and h∗, and sending g ∈ G to g-1 .\nThus if M is an H1,c(G, h)-module, then the full dual space M ∗ is an H1,c (M, h∗)-module.\nIf M ∈Oc(G, h)0, then we can define M +, which is the h-finite part of M ∗.\nProposition 3.32. M + belongs to Oc (G, h∗)0.\nProof. Clearly, if L is irreducible, then so is L+. Then L+ is generated by its lowest h\neigenspace over H1,c (G, h∗), hence over Sh∗. Thus, L+ ∈Oc (G, h∗)0. Now, let M ∈Oc(G, h)0\nbe any object. Since M has finite length, so does M +. Moreover, M + has a finite filtration\nwith successive quotients of the form L+, where L ∈Oc(G, h)0 is irreducible. This implies\nthe required statement, since Oc(G, h)0 is closed under taking extensions.\n\nClearly, M ++ = M. Thus, M 7→ M + is an equivalence of categories Oc(G, h) →Oc (G, h∗)op.\n3.12. The contravariant form. Let τ be an irreducible representation of G. By Propo\nsition 3.24, we have a unique homomorphism φ : Mc(G, h, τ)\nMc (G, h∗, τ ∗)+ which is the\n→\nidentity in the lowest h-eigenspace. Thus, we have a pairing\nβc : Mc(G, h, τ) × Mc (G, h∗, τ ∗) → C,\nwhich is called the contravariant form.\nRemark 3.33. If G =\n=\n= c, and τ ∼τ ∗\nW is a real reflection group, then h ∼h∗, c\n\n=\nvia a\nsymmetric form. So for real reflection groups, βc is a symmetric form on Mc(τ ).\nProposition 3.34. The maximal proper submodule Jc(τ ) is the kernel of φ (or, equivalently,\nof the contravariant form βc).\nProof. Let K be the kernel of the contravariant form. It suffices to show that Mc(τ)/K is\nirreducible. We have a diagram:\nφ\nMc(G, h, τ)\n� Mc(G, h∗, τ ∗)+\nPPPPPPPPPPPP\n�\nξ\nLc(G, h, τ)\nη\n∼ / Lc(G, h∗, τ ∗)+\n\nX\nX\nP\nX\nIndeed, a nonzero map ξ exists by Proposition 3.24, and it factors through Lc(G, h, τ),\nwith η being an isomorphism, since Lc(G, h∗, τ ∗)+ is irreducible. Now, by Proposition 3.24\n(uniqueness of φ), the diagram must commute up to scaling, which implies the statement.\nProposition 3.35. Assume that hc(τ) - hc(τ 0) never equals a positive integer for any τ, τ 0 ∈\nIrrepG. Then Oc(G, h)0 is semisimple, with simple objects Mc(τ).\nProof. It is clear that in this situation, all Mc(τ) are simple. Also consider Ext1(Mc(τ), Mc(τ 0)).\nIf hc(τ)-hc(τ 0) ∈/ Z, it is clearly 0. Otherwise, hc(τ) = hc(τ 0), and again Ext1(Mc(τ), Mc(τ 0)) =\n→\n0, since for any extension\nMc(τ 0)\nN\n→\n→\n→ Mc(τ) → 0,\nby Proposition 3.24 we have a splitting Mc(τ)\nN.\n\nRemark 3.36. In fact, our argument shows that if Ext1(Mc(τ), Mc(τ 0)) 6= 0, then hc(τ) -\nhc(τ 0) ∈ N.\n3.13. The matrix of multiplicities. For τ, σ ∈ IrrepG, write τ < σ if\nRe hc(σ) - Re hc(τ) ∈ N.\nProposition 3.37. There exists a matrix of integers N = (nσ,τ ), with nσ,τ ≥ 0, such that\nnτ,τ = 1, nσ,τ = 0 unless σ < τ , and\nMc(σ) =\nnσ,τ Lc(τ) ∈ K0(Oc(G, h)0).\nProof. This follows from the Jordan-H older theorem and the fact that objects in Oc(G, h)0\nhave finite length.\n\nCorollary 3.38. Let N -1 = ( nτ,σ). Then\nLc(τ) =\nn τ,σMc(σ).\nCorollary 3.39. We have\nn τ,σχσ(g)thc(τ )\nch Lc(τ )(g, t) =\n.\ndeth∗ (1 - tg)\nBoth of the corollaries can be obtained from the above proposition easily.\nOne of the main problems in the representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras is\nthe following problem.\nProblem: Compute the multiplicities nσ,τ or, equivalently, ch Lc(τ ) for all τ.\nIn general, this problem is open.\n3.14. Example: the rank 1 case. Let G = Z/mZ and λ be an m-th primitive root of 1.\nThen the algebra H1,c(G, h) is generated by x, y, s with relations\nm-1\n[y, x] = 1 - 2\ncj sj ,\nsxs-1 = λx,\nsys-1 = λ-1 y.\nj=1\nConsider the one-dimensional space C and let y act by 0 and g ∈ G act by 1. We have\nMc(C) = C[x]. The contravariant form βc,C on Mc(C) is defined by\n, x n) = an;\n, x n0 ) = 0, n = n0.\nβc,C(x n\nβc,C(x n\n\nX\n\nn\nRecall that βc,C satisfies βc,C(x , xn) = βc,C(xn-1, yxn), which gives\nan = an-1(n - bn),\nwhere bn are new parameters:\nm-1 1 - λjn\nbn := 2\ncj\n(b0 = 0, bn+m = bn).\n1 - λj\nj=1\nThus we obtain the following proposition.\nProposition 3.40.\n(i) Mc(C) is irreducible if only if n - bn = 0\nfor any n ≥ 1.\n(ii) Assume that r is the smallest positive integer such that r = br. Then Lc(C) has\ndimension r (which can be any number not divisible by m) with basis 1, x, . . . , xr-1 .\nRemark 3.41. According to Remark 3.31, this proposition in fact describes all the irre\nducible lowest weight modules.\nExample 3.42. Consider the case m = 2. The Mc(C) is irreducible unless c ∈ 1/2 + Z≥0.\nIf c = (2n + 1)/2 ∈ 1/2 + Z, n ≥ 0, then Lc(C) has dimension 2n + 1. A similar answer is\nobtained for lowest weight C-, replacing c by -c.\n3.15. The Frobenius property. Let A be a Z+-graded commutative algebra. The algebra\nA is called Frobenius if the top degree A[d] of A is 1-dimensional, and the multiplication\nmap A[m] × A[d - m]\nA[d] is a nondegenerate pairing for any 0 ≤ m ≤ d. In particular,\n→\nthe Hilbert polynomial of a Frobenius algebra A is palindromic.\nNow, let us go back to considering modules over the rational Cherednik algebra H1,c. Any\nsubmodule J of the polynomial representation Mc(C) = Mc = C[h] is an ideal in C[h], so\nthe quotient A = Mc/J is a Z+-graded commutative algebra.\nNow suppose that G preserves an inner product in h, i.e., G ⊆ O(h).\nTheorem 3.43. If A = Mc(C)/J is finite dimensional, then A is irreducible (A = Lc(C))\n⇐⇒ A is a Frobenius algebra.\nProof. 1) Suppose A is an irreducible H1,c-module, i.e., A = Lc(C). By Proposition 3.19, A\nis naturally a finite dimensional sl2-module (in particular, it integrates to the group SL2(C)).\nHence, by the representation theory of sl2, the top degree of A is 1-dimensional. Let φ ∈ A∗\ndenote a nonzero linear function on the top component. Let βc be the contravariant form\non Mc(C). Consider the form\n(v1, v2) 7→ E(v1, v2) := βc(v1, gv2), where g =\n-1\n∈ SL2(C).\nThen E(xv1, v2) = E(v1, xv2). So for any p, q ∈ Mc(C) = C[h], E(p, q) = φ(p(x)q(x)) (for a\nsuitable normalization of φ).\nSince E is a nondegenerate form, A is a Frobenius algebra.\n2) Suppose A is Frobenius.\nThen the highest component is 1-dimensional, and\nE : A ⊗ A → C, E(a, b) = φ(ab) is nondegenerate. We have E(xa, b) = E(a, xb). So\nset β(a, b) = E(a, g-1b). Then β satisfies β(a, xib) = β(yia, b). Thus, for all p, q ∈ C[h],\nβ(p(x), q(x)) = β(q(y)p(x), 1). So β = βc up to scaling. Thus, βc is nondegenerate and A is\nirreducible.\n\nRemark 3.44. If G * O(h), this theorem is false, in general.\n\nNow consider the Frobenius property of Lc(C) for any G ⊂ GL(h).\nTheorem 3.45. Let U ⊂ Mc(C) = C[h] be a G-subrepresentation of dimension l = dim h,\nsitting in degree r, which consists of singular vectors. Let J = hUi. Assume that A = Mc/J\nis finite dimensional. Then\n(i) A is Frobenius.\n(ii) A admits a BGG type resolution:\nA ← Mc(C) ← Mc(U) ← Mc(∧2U) ← · · · ← Mc(∧lU) ← 0.\n(iii) The character of A is given by the formula\nl\n2cs\nχA(g, t) = t 2 - P\n1-λs detU (1 - gtr) .\ns∈S\ndeth∗ (1 - gt)\nIn particular, dim A = rl .\n(iv) If G preserves an inner product, then A is irreducible.\nProof. (i) Since Spec A is a complete intersection, A is Frobenius.\n(ii) We will use the following theorem:\nTheorem 3.46 (Serre). Let f1, . . . , fn ∈ C[t1, . . . , tn] be homogeneous polynomials, and\nassume that C[t1, . . . , tn] is a finitely generated module over C[f1, . . . , fn]. Then this is a free\nmodule.\nConsider SU ⊂ Sh∗. Then Sh∗ is a finitely generated SU-module (as Sh∗/hUi is finite\ndimensional). By Serre's theorem, we know that Sh∗ is a free SU-module. The rank of this\nmodule is rl . Consider the Koszul complex attached to this module. Since the module is\nfree, the Koszul complex is exact (i.e., it is a resolution of the zero fiber). At the level of\nSU-modules, it looks exactly like we want in (3.45).\nSo we only need to show that the maps of the resolution are morphisms over H1,c. This\nis shown by induction. Namely, let δj : Mc(∧j U) → Mc(∧j-1U) be the corresponding\ndifferentials (so that δ0 : Mc(C)\nA is the projection). Then δ0 is an H1,c-morphism, which\n→\nis the base of induction. If δj is an H1,c-morphism, then the kernel of δj is a submodule\nKj ⊂ Mc(∧j U). Its lowest degree part is ∧j+1U sitting in degree (j + 1)r and consisting of\nsingular vectors. Now, δj+1 is a morphism over Sh∗ which maps ∧j+1U identically to itself.\nBy Proposition 3.24, there is only one such morphism, and it must be an H1,c-morphism.\nThis completes the induction step.\n(iii) follows from (ii) by the Euler-Poincar e formula.\n(iv) follows from Theorem 3.43.\n3.16. Representations of H1,c of type A. Let us now apply the above results to the case\nof type A. We will follow the paper [CE].\nLet G = Sn, and h be its reflection representation. In this case the function c reduces\nto one number. We will denote the rational Cherednik algebra H1,c(Sn) by Hc(n). It is\ngenerated by x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn and CSn with the following relations:\nX\nX\nyi = 0,\nxi = 0,\n[yi, xj] = -n + csij , i =6\nj,\n\nP\nY\nX\n\n!\nn - 1\nX\n[yi, xi] =\n- c\nsij .\nn\nj=i\nThe polynomial representation Mc(C) of this algebra is the space of C[x1, . . . , xn]T of poly\nnomials of x1, . . . , xn, which are invariant under simultaneous translation T : xi 7→ xi + a.\nIn other words, it is the space of regular functions on h = Cn/Δ, where Δ is the diagonal.\nProposition 3.47 (C. Dunkl). Let r be a positive integer not divisible by n, and c = r/n.\nThen Mc(C) contains a copy of the reflection representation h of Sn, which consists of\nsingular vectors (i.e. those killed by y ∈ h). This copy sits in degree r and is spanned by the\nfunctions\ndz\nn\nr\nfi(x1, . . . , xn) = Resinf[(z - x1)\n(z - xn)]\n· · ·\n.\nz - xi\n(the symbol Resinf denotes the residue at infinity).\nRemark 3.48. The space spanned by fi is (n - 1)-dimensional, since\nfi = 0 (this sum\ni\nis the residue of an exact differential).\nProof. This proposition can be proved by a straightforward computation. The functions fi\nare a special case of Jack polynomials.\n\nLet Ic be the submodule of Mc(C) generated by fi. Consider the Hc(n)-module Vc =\nMc(C)/Ic, and regard it as a C[h]-module. We have the following results.\nTheorem 3.49. Let d = (r, n) denote the greatest common divisor of r and n. Then the\n(set-theoretical) support of Vc is the union of Sn-translates of the subspaces of Cn/Δ, defined\nby the equations\n;\nx\n;\n. . .\nx(d-1)\nx1 = x2 =\n= x\n· · ·\n+1 = · · · = x2\n+1 = · · · = xn.\nn\nn\nn\nn\nd\nd\nd\nd\nIn particular, the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of Vc is d - 1.\nCorollary 3.50 ([BEG]). If d = 1 then the module Vc is finite dimensional, irreducible,\nadmits a BGG type resolution, and its character is\nχVc (g, t) = t(1-r)(n-1)/2 det |h(1 - gtr) .\ndet |h(1 - gt)\nProof. For d = 1 Theorem 3.49 says that the support of Mc(C)/Ic is {0}. This implies that\nMc(C)/Ic is finite dimensional. The rest follows from Theorem 3.45.\n\nProof of Theorem 3.49. The support of Vc is the zero set of Ic, i.e. the common zero set of\nn\nX\nfi. Fix x1, . . . , xn ∈ C. Then fi(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 for all i iff\nλifi = 0 for all λi, i.e.\n\n!\ni=1\nn\nY\nn\nX\nr\nλi\nn\nResinf\n(z - xj )\ndz = 0.\nz - xi\nj=1\ni=1\nAssume that x1, . . . xn take distinct values y1, . . . , yp with positive multiplicities m1, . . . , mp.\nThe previous equation implies that the point (x1, . . . , xn) is in the zero set iff\np\np\nr\nResinf\n(z - yj )mj n -1\nνi(z - y1) · · · (z\\\n- yi) · · · (z - yp)\ndz = 0 ∀νi.\nj=1\ni=1\n\nY\nY\nP\nP\nX\nY\nX\nP\nP\nY\nSince νi are arbitrary, this is equivalent to the condition\np\nResinf\n(z - yj )mj n\nr -1 z idz = 0,\ni = 0, . . . , p - 1.\nj=1\nWe will now need the following lemma.\np\nLemma 3.51. Let a(z) =\n(z -yj )μj , where μj ∈ C,\nj μj ∈ Z and\nj μj > -p. Suppose\nj=1\nResinfa(z)z idz = 0,\ni = 0, 1, . . . , p - 2.\nThen a(z) is a polynomial.\nProof. Let g(z) be a polynomial. Then\n0 = Resinfd(g(z) a(z)) = Resinf(g0(z)a(z) + a0(z)g(z))dz,\n·\nand hence\n\n!\nRes\ng0(z) +\nμj\ng(z) a(z)dz = 0.\ninf\nz - yj\ni\nLet g(z) = z l\n(z - yj).

This means that for every l ≥ 0,\nResinfz l+p-1 a(z)dz is a linear combination of residues of zqa(z)dz with q < l + p - 1. By\nthe assumption of the lemma, this implies by induction in l that all such residues are 0 and\nhence a is a polynomial.\n\nIn our case\n(mj r/n - 1) = r - p (since\nmj = n) and the conditions of the lemma are\np\nsatisfied. Hence (x1, . . . , xn) is in the zero set of Ic iff\n(z - yj)mj n\nr -1 is a polynomial. This\nj=1\nis equivalent to saying that all mj are divisible by n/d.\nWe have proved that (x1, . . . , xn) is in the zero set of Ic if and only if (z - x1)\n(z - xn)\n· · ·\nis the (n/d)-th power of a polynomial of degree d. This implies the theorem.\n\nRemark 3.52. For c > 0, the above representations are the only irreducible finite di\nmensional representations of H1,c(Sn). Namely, it is proved in [BEG] that the only finite\ndimensional representations of H1,c(Sn) are multiples of Lc(C) for c = r/n, and of Lc(C-)\n(where C- is the sign representation) for c = -r/n, where r is a positive integer relatively\nprime to n.\n3.17. Notes. The discussion of the definition of rational Cherednik algebras and their basic\nproperties follows Section 7 of [E4]. The discussion of the category O for rational Cherednik\nalgebras follows Section 11 of [E4]. The material in Sections 3.14-3.16 is borrowed from [CE].\n\nY\nQ\n4. The Macdonald-Mehta integral\n4.1. Finite Coxeter groups and the Macdonald-Mehta integral. Let W be a finite\nCoxeter group of rank r with real reflection representation hR equipped with a Euclidean\nW -invariant inner product (·, ). Denote by h the complexification of hR. The reflection\n·\nhyperplanes subdivide hR into |W | chambers; let us pick one of them to be the dominant\nchamber and call its interior D. For each reflection hyperplane, pick the perpendicular vector\nα ∈ hR with (α, α) = 2 which has positive inner products with elements of D, and call it\nthe positive root corresponding to this hyperplane. The walls of D are then defined by the\nequations (αi, v) = 0, where αi are simple roots. Denote by S the set of reflections in W ,\nand for a reflection s ∈S denote by αs the corresponding positive root. Let\nδ(x) =\n(αs, x)\ns∈S\nbe the corresponding discriminant polynomial. Let di, i = 1, . . . , r, be the degrees of the\ngenerators of the algebra C[h]W . Note that W =\ni di.\n|\n|\n-k\nLet H1,c(W, h) be the rational Cherednik algebra of W . Here we choose c =\nas a\nconstant function. Let Mc = Mc(C) be the polynomial representation of H1,c(W, h), and βc\nbe the contravariant form on Mc defined in Section 3.12. We normalize it by the condition\nβc(1, 1) = 1.\nTheorem 4.1.\n(i) (The Macdonald-Mehta integral) For Re (k) ≥ 0, one has\nZ\nrY Γ(1 + kdi)\n(4.1)\n(2π)-r/2\ne-(x,x)/2|δ(x)|2kdx =\nΓ(1 + k) .\nhR\ni=1\n(ii) Let b(k) := βc(δ, δ).

The non-crystallographic\ncases were done by Opdam in [Op2] using a direct computation in the rank 2 case (reducing\n(4.1) to the beta integral by passing to polar coordinates), and a computer calculation by F.\nGarvan for H3 and H4.\nExample 4.2. In the case W = Sn, we have the following integral (the Mehta integral):\nZ\nn\nY\nY Γ(1 + kd) .\n(2π)-(n-1)/2\n{x∈Rn| P\ni xi=0}\ne-(x,x)/2\n|xi - xj |2kdx =\nΓ(1 + k)\ni=j\nd=2\nIn the next subsection, we give a uniform proof of Theorem 4.1 which is given in [E2]. We\nemphasize that many parts of this proof are borrowed from Opdam's previous proof of this\ntheorem.\n4.2. Proof of Theorem 4.1.\nProposition 4.3. The function b is a polynomial of degree at most |S|, and the roots of b\nare negative rational numbers.\n\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nProof. Since δ has degree |S|, it follows from the definition of b that it is a polynomial of\ndegree ≤ |S|.\nSuppose that b(k) = 0 for some k ∈ C. Then βc(δ, P ) = 0 for any polynomial P . Indeed,\nif there exists a P such that βc(δ, P ) = 0, then there exists such a P which is antisymmetric\nof degree |S|. Then P must be a multiple of δ which contradicts the equality βc(δ, δ) = 0.\nThus, Mc is reducible and hence has a singular vector, i.e. a nonzero homogeneous poly\nnomial f of positive degree d living in an irreducible representation τ of W killed by ya.\nApplying the element h =\ni xai yai + r/2 + k\ns to f, we get\ns∈S\nd ,\nk = -mτ\nwhere mτ is the eigenvalue of the operator T :=\n(1 - s) on τ. But it is clear (by\ns∈S\ncomputing the trace of T ) that mτ ≥ 0 and mτ ∈ Q. This implies that any root of b is\nnegative rational.\n\nDenote the Macdonald-Mehta integral by F (k).\nProposition 4.4. One has\nF (k + 1) = b(k)F (k).\nProof. Let F =\ni ya\ni /2. Introduce the Gaussian inner product on Mc as follows:\nDefinition 4.5. The Gaussian inner product γc on Mc is given by the formula\nγc(v, v0) = βc(exp(F)v, exp(F)v0).\nThis makes sense because the operator F is locally nilpotent on Mc. Note that δ is a\nnonzero W -antisymmetric polynomial of the smallest possible degree, so (\nya\ni )δ = 0 and\nhence\n(4.2)\nγc(δ, δ) = βc(δ, δ) = b(k).\nFor a ∈ h, let xa ∈ h∗ ⊂ H1,c(W, h), ya ∈ h ⊂ H1,c(W, h) be the corresponding generators\nof the rational Cherednik algebra.\nProposition 4.6. Up to scaling, γc is the unique W -invariant symmetric bilinear form on\nMc satisfying the condition\nγc((xa - ya)v, v0) = γc(v, yav0), a ∈ h.\nProof. We have\nγc((xa - ya)v, v0) = βc(exp(F)(xa - ya)v, exp(F)v0) = βc(xa exp(F)v, exp(F)v0)\n= βc(exp(F)v, ya exp(F)v0) = βc(exp(F)v, exp(F)yav0) = γc(v, yav0).\nLet us now show uniqueness. If γ is any W -invariant symmetric bilinear form satisfying\nthe condition of the Proposition, then let β(v, v0) = γ(exp(-F)v, exp(-F)v0). Then β is\ncontravariant, so it's a multiple of βc, hence γ is a multiple of γc.\n\nNow we will need the following known result (see [Du2], Theorem 3.10).\n\nZ\n\nR\nProposition 4.7. For Re (k) ≥ 0 we have\n(4.3)\nγc(f, g) = F (k)-1\nf(x)g(x)dμc(x)\nhR\nwhere\ndμc(x) := e-(x,x)/2|δ(x)|2kdx.\nProof. It follows from Proposition 4.6 that γc is uniquely, up to scaling, determined by the\ncondition that it is W -invariant, and y+ = xa - ya. These properties are easy to check for the\na\nright hand side of (4.3), using the fact that the action of ya is given by Dunkl operators.\nNow we can complete the proof of Proposition 4.4. By Proposition 4.7, we have\nF (k + 1) = F (k)γc(δ, δ),\nso by (4.2) we have\nF (k + 1) = F (k)b(k).\nLet\nY\nb(k) = b0\n(k + ki)ni .\nWe know that ki > 0, and also b0 > 0 (because the inner product β0 on real polynomials is\npositive definite).\nCorollary 4.8. We have\n\nni\nY Γ(k + ki)\nF (k) = bk\n.\nΓ(ki)\ni\nProof. Denote the right hand side by F∗(k) and let φ(k) = F (k)/F∗(k). Clearly, φ(0) = 1.\nProposition 4.4 implies that φ(k) is a 1-periodic positive function on [0, inf). Also by the\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality,\nF (k)F (k0) ≥ F ((k + k0)/2)2 ,\nso log F (k) is convex for k ≥ 0. This implies that φ = 1, since (log F∗(k))00 → 0 as k →\n+inf.\n\nRemark 4.9. The proof of this corollary is motivated by the standard proof of the following\nwell known characterization of the Γ function.\nProposition 4.10. The Γ function is determined by three properties:\n(i) Γ(x) is positive on [1, +inf) and Γ(1) = 1;\n(ii) Γ(x + 1) = xΓ(x);\n(iii) log Γ(x) is a convex function on [1, +inf).\nProof. It is easy to see from the definition Γ(x) =\ninf tx-1e-tdt that the Γ function has\nproperties (i) and (ii); property (iii) follows from this definition and the Cauchy-Schwarz\ninequality.\nConversely, suppose we have a function F (x) satisfying the above properties, then we have\nF (x) = φ(x)Γ(x) for some 1-periodic function φ(x) with φ(x) > 0. Thus, we have\n(log F )00 = (log φ)00 + (log Γ)00.\n\nZ\nX\nY\nR\n\nY\nSince limx\n+inf(log Γ)00 = 0, (log F )00 ≥ 0, and φ is periodic, we have (log φ)00 ≥ 0. Since\nR n+1\n→\n(log φ)00dx = 0, we see that (log φ)00 ≡ 0. So we have φ(x) ≡ 1.\n\nn\nIn particular, we see from Corollary 4.8 and the multiplication formulas for the Γ function\nthat part (ii) of Theorem 4.1 implies part (i).\nIt remains to establish (ii).\nProposition 4.11. The polynomial b has degree exactly |S|.\nProof. By Proposition 4.3, b is a polynomial of degree at most |S|. To see that the degree is\nprecisely |S|, let us make the change of variable x = k1/2y in the Macdonald-Mehta integral\nand use the steepest descent method. We find that the leading term of the asymptotics of\nlog F (k) as k → +inf is |S|k log k. This together with the Stirling formula and Corollary 4.8\nimplies the statement.\n\nProposition 4.12. The function\nrY 1 - e2πikdj\nG(k) := F (k)\n2πik\n1 - e\nj=1\nanalytically continues to an entire function of k.\nProof. Let ξ ∈ D be an element. Consider the real hyperplane Ct = itξ + hR, t > 0. Then\nCt does not intersect reflection hyperplanes, so we have a continuous branch of δ(x)2k on\nCt which tends to the positive branch in D as t\n0. Then, it is easy to see that for any\n→\n2πik`(w)\nw ∈ W , the limit of this branch in the chamber w(D) will be e\n|δ(x)|2k, where `(w) is\nthe length of w. Therefore, by letting t = 0, we get\nX\n(2π)-r/2\ne-(x,x)/2δ(x)2kdx =\nF (k)(\ne 2πik`(w))\nCt\n|W |\nw∈W\n(as this integral does not depend on t by Cauchy's theorem). But it is well known that\n2πik`(w)\nr 1 - e2πikdj\ne\n=\n,\n1 - e2πik\nw∈W\nj=1\n([Hu], p.73), so\nZ\n(2π)-r/2|W |\nCt\ne-(x,x)/2δ(x)2kdx = G(k).\nSince\nCt e-(x,x)/2δ(x)2kdx is clearly an entire function, the statement is proved.\nCorollary 4.13. For every k0 ∈ [-1, 0] the total multiplicity of all the roots of b of the\nform k0 - p, p ∈ Z+, equals the number of ways to represent k0 in the form -m/di, m =\n1, . . . , di - 1. In other words, the roots of b are ki,m = -m/di - pi,m, 1 ≤ m ≤ di - 1, where\npi,m ∈ Z+.\nProof. We have\nG(k - p) =\nF (k)\nr 1 - e2πikdj\n,\nb(k - 1)\nb(k - p) j=1 1 - e2πik\n· · ·\n\nX\nX\nX X\nP\nX\nNow plug in k = 1 + k0 and a large positive integer p. Since by Proposition 4.12 the left\nhand side is regular, so must be the right hand side, which implies the claimed upper bound\nfor the total multiplicity, as F (1 + k0) > 0. The fact that the bound is actually attained\nfollows from the fact that the polynomial b has degree exactly |S| (Proposition 4.11), and\nthe fact that all roots of b are negative rational (Proposition 4.3).\n\nIt remains to show that in fact in Corollary 4.13, pi,m = 0 for all i, m; this would imply\n(ii) and hence (i).\nProposition 4.14. Identity (4.1) of Theorem 4.1 is satisfied in C[k]/k2 .\nProof. Indeed, we clearly have F (0) = 1. Next, a rank 1 computation gives F 0(0) = -γ|S|,\nwhere γ is the Euler constant (i.e. γ = limn\n+inf(1 +\n+ 1/n - log n)), while the derivative\n→\n· · ·\nof the right hand side of (4.1) at zero equals to\nr\n-γ\n(di - 1).\ni=1\nBut it is well known that\nr\n(di - 1) = |S|,\ni=1\n([Hu], p.62), which implies the result.\n\nProposition 4.15. Identity (4.1) of Theorem 4.1 is satisfied in C[k]/k3 .\nNote that Proposition 4.15 immediately implies (ii), and hence the whole theorem. Indeed,\nit yields that\nr\ndi-1\n(log F )00(0) =\n(log Γ)00(m/di),\ni=1 m=1\nso by Corollary 4.13\nr X\nr\ndi-1\nX di-1\nX X\n(log Γ)00(m/di + pi,m) =\n(log Γ)00(m/di),\ni=1 m=1\ni=1 m=1\nwhich implies that pi,m = 0 since (log Γ)00 is strictly decreasing on [0, inf).\nTo prove Proposition 4.15, we will need the following result about finite Coxeter groups.\nLet ψ(W ) = 3|S|2 -\nr (d2 - 1).\ni=1\ni\nLemma 4.16. One has\n(4.4)\nψ(W ) =\nψ(G),\nG∈Par2(W )\nwhere Par2(W ) is the set of parabolic subgroups of W of rank 2.\nProof. Let\nr\nQ(q) = |W |\nY\n-\n-\nq\nq .\ndi\ni=1\n\nX\nX\nX Z\nIt follows from Chevalley's theorem that\nQ(q) = (1 - q)r\ndet(1 - qw|h)-1 .\nw∈W\nLet us subtract the terms for w = 1 and w ∈S from both sides of this equation, divide both\nsides by (q - 1)2, and set q = 1 (cf. [Hu], p.62, formula (21)). Let W2 be the set of elements\nof W that can be written as a product of two different reflections. Then by a straightforward\ncomputation we get\nX\nψ(W ) =\n.\nw∈W2 r - Tr h(w)\nIn particular, this is true for rank 2 groups. The result follows, as any element w ∈ W2\nbelongs to a unique parabolic subgroup Gw of rank 2 (namely, the stabilizer of a generic\npoint hw, [Hu], p.22).\n\nProof of Proposition 4.15. Now we are ready to prove the proposition. By Proposition 4.14,\nit suffices to show the coincidence of the second derivatives of (4.1) at k = 0. The second\nderivative of the right hand side of (4.1) at zero is equal to\nπ2\nr\n(d2 - 1) + γ2|S|2 .\ni\ni=1\nOn the other hand, we have\nF 00(0) = (2π)-r/2\ne-(x,x)/2 log α2(x) log β2(x)dx.\nα,β∈S\nhR\nThus, from a rank 1 computation we see that our job is to establish the equality\nZ\nr\n(2π)-r/2 X\ne-(x,x)/2 log α2(x) log α\nβ2\n(\n(\nx\nx\n)\n)dx = π\n(\nX\n(di\n2 - 1) - 3|S|2) = - π\nψ(W ).\nα=β∈S\nhR\ni=1\nSince this equality holds in rank 2 (as in this case (4.1) reduces to the beta integral), in\ngeneral it reduces to equation (4.4) (as for any α 6= β ∈ S, sα and sβ are contained in a\nunique parabolic subgroup of W of rank 2). The proposition is proved.\n\n4.3. Application: the supports of Lc(C). In this subsection we will use the Macdonald-\nMehta integral to computation of the support of the irreducible quotient of the polynoamial\nrepresentation of a rational Cherednik algebra (with equal parameters). We will follow the\npaper [E3].\nFirst note that the vector space h has a stratification labeled by parabolic subgroups of W .\nIndeed, for a parabolic subgroup W 0 ⊂ W , let hW 0 be the set of points in h whose stabilizer\nreg\nis W 0. Then\na\nh =\nhW 0 ,\nreg\nW 0∈Par(W )\nwhere Par(W ) is the set of parabolic subgroups in W .\nFor a finitely generated module M over C[h], denote the support of M by supp (M).\nThe following theorem is proved in [Gi1], Section 6 and in [BE] with different method. We\nwill recall the proof from [BE] later.\n\nTheorem 4.17. Consider the stratification of h with respect to stabilizers of points in W .\nThen the support supp (M) of any object M of Oc(W, h) in h is a union of strata of this\nstratification.\nThis makes one wonder which strata occur in supp (Lc(τ)), for given c and τ. In [VV],\nVaragnolo and Vasserot gave a partial answer for τ = C. Namely, they determined (for W\nbeing a Weyl group) when Lc(C) is finite dimensional, which is equivalent to supp (Lc(C)) =\n0. For the proof (which is quite complicated), they used the geometry affine Springer fibers.\nHere we will give a different (and simpler) proof. In fact, we will prove a more general result.\nRecall that for any Coxeter group W , we have the Poincar e polynomial:\nr\nPW (q) =\nX\nq `(w) =\nY 1 - qdi(W )\n, where di(W ) are the degrees of W.\nw∈W\ni=1\n1 - q\nLemma 4.18. If W 0 ⊂ W is a parabolic subgroup of W , then PW is divisible by PW 0 .\nProof. By Chevalley's theorem, C[h] is a free module over C[h]W and C[h]W 0 is a direct\nsummand in this module. So C[h]W 0 is a projective module, thus free (since it is graded).\nHence, there exists a polynomial Q(q) such that we have\nQ(q)hC[h]W (q) = hC[h]W 0 (q),\nwhere hV (q) denotes the Hilbert series of a graded vector space V . Notice that we have\nhC[h]W (q) =\n, so we have\nPW (q)(1 - q)r\nQ(q)\nPW (q) =\nPW 0 (q), i.e. Q(q) = PW (q)/PW 0 (q).\n\nCorollary 4.19. If m ≥ 2 then we have the following inequality:\n#{i|m divides di(W )} ≥ #{i|m divides di(W 0)}.\nProof. This follows from Lemma 4.18 by looking at the roots of the polynomials PW and\nPW 0 .\n\nOur main result is the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.20. [E3] Let c ≥ 0. Then a ∈ supp (Lc(C)) if and only if\nPW (e 2πic) = 0.\nPWa\nWe can obtain the following corollary easily.\nCorollary 4.21.\n(i) Lc(C) 6= Mc(C) if and only if c ∈ Q>0 and the denominator m of\nc divides di for some i;\n(ii) Lc(C) is finite dimensional if and only if PW (e2πic) = 0, i.e., iff\nPW 0\n#{i|m divides di(W )} > #{i|m divides di(W 0)}.\nfor any maximal parabolic subgroup W 0 ⊂ W .\n\nZ\nZ\nRemark 4.22. Varagnolo and Vasserot prove that Lc(C) is finite dimensional if and only if\nthere exists a regular elliptic element in W of order m. Case-by-case inspection shows that\nthis condition is equivalent to the combinatorial condition of (2). Also, a uniform proof of\nthis equivalence is given in the appendix to [E3], written by S. Griffeth.\nExample 4.23. For type An-1, i.e., W = Sn, we get that Lc(C) is finite dimensional if and\nonly if the denominator of c is n. This agrees with our previous results in type An-1.\nExample 4.24. Suppose W is the Coxeter group of type E7. Then we have the following\nlist of maximal parabolic subgroups and the degrees (note that E7 itself is not a maximal\nparabolic).\nSubgroups\nE7\nD6\nA3 × A2 × A1\nA6\nDegrees\n2,6,8,10,12,14,18 2,4,6,6,8,10\n2,3,4,2,3,2\n2,3,4,5,6,7\nSubgroups\nA4 × A2\nE6\nD5 × A1\nA5 × A1\nDegrees\n2,3,4,5,2,3\n2,5,6,8,9,12\n2,4,5,6,8,2\n2,3,4,5,6,2\nSo Lc(C) is finite dimensional if and only if the denominator of c is 2, 6, 14, 18.\nThe rest of the subsection is dedicated to the proof of Theorem 4.20. First we recall some\nbasic facts about the Schwartz space and tempered distributions.\nLet S(Rn) be the set of Schwartz functions on Rn, i.e.\nS(Rn) = {f ∈ Cinf(Rn)|∀α, β, sup |x α∂β f(x)| < inf}.\nThis space has a natural topology.\nA tempered distribution on Rn is a continuous linear functional on S(Rn). Let S0(Rn)\ndenote the space of tempered distributions.\nWe will use the following well known lemma.\nLemma 4.25.\n(i) C[x]e-x2/2 ⊂ S(Rn) is a dense subspace.\n(ii) Any tempered distribution ξ has finite order, i.e., ∃N = N(ξ) such that if f ∈ S(Rn)\nsatisfying f = df =\n= dN-1f = 0 on supp ξ, then hξ, fi = 0.\n· · ·\nProof of Theorem 4.20. Recall that on Mc(C), we have the Gaussian form γc from Section\n4.2. We have for Re (c) ≤ 0,\n(2π)-r/2\nγc(P, Q) = FW (-c)\ne-x2/2|δ(x)|-2cP (x)Q(x)dx,\nhR\nwhere P, Q are polynomials and\nFW (k) = (2π)-r/2\ne-x2/2|δ(x)|2kdx\nhR\nis the Macdonald-Mehta integral.\nConsider the distribution:\n(2π)-r/2\nξW = FW (-c) |δ(x)|-2c .\nc\nIt is well-known that this distribution is meromorphic in c (Bernstein's theorem). Moreover,\nsince γc(P, Q) is a polynomial in c for any P and Q, this distribution is in fact holomorphic\nin c ∈ C.\n\nY\nY\nProposition 4.26.\nsupp (ξc\nW )\n= {a ∈ hR\nFWa (-c) = 0} = {a ∈ hR\nPW (e 2πic) = 0}\n| FW\n|PWa\n= {a ∈ hR|#{i|denominator of c divides di(W )}\n= #{i|denominator of c divides di(Wa)}}.\nProof. First note that the last equality follows from the product formula for the Poincar e\npolynomial, and the second equality from the Macdonald-Mehta identity. Now let us prove\nthe first equality.\nLook at ξW near a ∈ h. Equivalently, we can consider\nc\n(2π)-r/2\nξW (x + a) = FW (-c) |δ(x + a)|-2c\nc\nwith x near 0. We have\nδW (x + a)\n=\nαs(x + a) =\n(αs(x) + αs(a))\ns∈SY\ns∈S\nY\n=\nαs(x)\n(αs(x) + αs(a))\n·\ns∈S∩Wa\ns∈S\\S∩Wa\n= δWa (x) Ψ(x),\n·\nwhere Ψ is a nonvanishing function near a (since αs(a) = 0 if\ns /∈S ∩ Wa).\nSo near a, we have\nξW\nFWa\nξWa\n-2c\nc (x + a) = FW\n(-c) ·\n(x) · |Ψ|\n,\nc\nand the last factor is well defined since Ψ is nonvanishing. Thus ξc\nW (x) is nonzero near a if\nand only if FWa (-c) = 0 which finishes the proof.\n\nFW\nProposition 4.27. For c ≥ 0,\nsupp (ξc\nW ) = supp Lc(C)R,\nwhere the right hand side stands for the real points of the support.\nProof. Let a /∈ supp Lc(C) and assume a ∈ supp ξW . Then we can find a P ∈ Jc(C) = ker γc\nc\nsuch that P (a) = 0. Pick a compactly supported test function\nφ ∈ Cinf(hR) such that P does\nc\nnot vanish anywhere on supp φ, and hξW , φi 6= 0 (this can be done since P (a) 6= 0 and ξW\nc\nc\nis nonzero near a). Then we have φ/P ∈ S(hR). Thus from Lemma 4.25 (i) it follows that\nthere exists a sequence of polynomials Pn such that\nPn(x)e-x2/2 → P\nφ in S(hR), when n →inf.\nSo PPne-x2/2 → φ in S(hR), when n →inf.\nBut we have hξc\nW , PPne-x2/2i = γc(P, Pn) = 0 which is a contradiction. This implies that\nsupp ξc\nW ⊂ (supp Lc(C))R.\nTo show the opposite inclusion, let P be a polynomial on h which vanishes identically on\nsupp ξW . By Lemma 4.25 (ii), there exists N such that hξW , P N (x)Q(x)e-x2/2i = 0. Thus,\nc\nc\n\nfor any polynomial Q, γc(P N , Q) = 0, i.e. P N ∈ Ker γc. Thus, P |supp Lc(C) = 0. This implies\nthe required inclusion, since supp ξc\nW is a union of strata.\n\nTheorem 4.20 follows from Proposition 4.26 and Proposition 4.27.\n\n4.4. Notes. Our exposition in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 follows the paper [E2]; Section 4.3 follows\nthe paper [E3].\n\nc\nd\n5. Parabolic induction and restriction functors for rational Cherednik\nalgebras\n5.1. A geometric approach to rational Cherednik algebras. An important property\nof the rational Cherednik algebra H1,c(G, h) is that it can be sheafified, as an algebra, over\nh/G (see [E1]). More specifically, the usual sheafification of H1,c(G, h) as a Oh/G-module\nis in fact a quasicoherent sheaf of algebras, H1,c,G,h. Namely, for every affine open subset\nU ⊂ h/G, the algebra of sections H1,c,G,h(U) is, by definition, C[U] ⊗C[h]G H1,c(G, h).\nThe same sheaf can be defined more geometrically as follows (see [E1], Section 2.9). Let\nUe be the preimage of U in h. Then the algebra H1,c,G,h(U) is the algebra of linear operators\non O(Ue) generated by O(Ue), the group G, and Dunkl operators\nX 2cs αs(a)\n∂a -\n(1 - s), where a ∈ h.\n1 - λs αs\ns∈S\n5.2. Completion of rational Cherednik algebras. For any b ∈ h we can define the\ncompletion d(G, h)b to be the algebra of sections of the sheaf H1,c,G,h on the formal neigh\nH1,c\nborhood of the image of b in h/G. Namely, d(G, h)b\nH1,c\nis generated by regular functions on\nthe formal neighborhood of the G-orbit of b, the group G, and Dunkl operators.\nThe algebra d(G, h)b inherits from H1,c(G, h) the natural filtration F by order of dif\nH1,c\n-\nferential operators, and each of the spaces F n d(G, h)b has a projective limit topology; the\nH1,c\nwhole algebra is then equipped with the topology of the nested union (or inductive limit).\nConsider the completion of the rational Cherednik algebra at zero, Hd\n1,c(G, h)0. It naturally\ncontains the algebra C[[h]]. Define the category b (G, h) of representations of d(G, h)0\nOc\nH1,c\nwhich are finitely generated over C[[h]]0 = C[[h]].\nWe have a completion functor b: Oc(G, h) →Obc(G, h), defined by\nM = H1,c(G, h)0 ⊗H1,c(G,h) M = C[[h]] ⊗C[h] M.\nAlso, for N ∈Obc(G, h), let E(N) be the subspace spanned by generalized eigenvectors of\nh in N where h is defined by (3.2). Then it is easy to see that E(N) ∈Oc(G, h)0.\nTheorem 5.1. The restriction of the completion functor b to Oc(G, h)0 is an equivalence\nof categories Oc(G, h)0 →Obc(G, h). The inverse equivalence is given by the functor E.\nProof. It is clear that M ⊂ c\nM) (as M is spanned by generalized eigenvectors\nM, so M ⊂ E(c\nof h). Let us demonstrate the opposite inclusion. Pick generators m1, . . . , mr of M which\nare generalized eigenvectors of h with eigenvalues μ1, . . . , μr. Let 0\nM). Then v\n= v ∈ E(c\n=\nP fimi, where fi ∈ C[[h]]. Assume that (h- μ)N v = 0 for some N.\nThen v = P f (μ-μi)mi,\ni\ni\ni\n= E(c\nwhere for f ∈ C[[h]] we denote by f (d) the degree d part of f. Thus v ∈ M, so M\nM).\nIt remains to show that E\\\n(N) = N, i.e. that N is the closure of E(N). In other words,\nletting m denote the maximal ideal in C[[h]], we need to show that the natural map E(N)\nN/mj N is surjective for every j.\n→\nTo do so, note that h preserves the descending filtration of N by subspaces mj N. On\nthe other hand, the successive quotients of these subspaces, mj N/mj+1N, are finite dimen\nsional, which implies that h acts locally finitely on their direct sum grN, and moreover each\n\nc\nb\nc\nP\ngeneralized eigenspace is finite dimensional. Now for each β ∈ C denote by Nj,β the general\nized β-eigenspace of h in N/mjN. We have surjective homomorphisms Nj+1,β → Nj,β, and\nfor large enough j they are isomorphisms. This implies that the map E(N)\nN/mj N is\nsurjective for every j, as desired.\n→\n\nExample. Suppose that c = 0. Then Theorem 5.1 specializes to the well known fact that\nthe category of G-equivariant local systems on h with a locally nilpotent action of partial\ndifferentiations is equivalent to the category of all G-equivariant local systems on the formal\nneighborhood of zero in h. In fact, both categories in this case are equivalent to the category\nof finite dimensional representations of G.\nWe can now define the composition functor J\nJ (M) = E(M). The functor J is called the Jacquet functor ([Gi2]).\n: Oc(G, h) →Oc(G, h)0, by the formula\n5.3. The duality functor. Recall that in Section 3.11, for any H1,c(G, h)-module M, the\nfull dual space M ∗ is naturally an H1,c (G, h∗)-module, via πM ∗ (a) = πM (γ(a))∗.\nIt is clear that the duality functor ∗ defines an equivalence between the category Oc\n(G, h∗)op, and that M + = E(M ∗) (where M + is the contragredient, or restricted dual\nb\nO\n(G, h)0\nand\nc\nmodule to M defined in Section 3.11).\n5.4.

To prove the \"only if\" part, assume that\n(h - μ)N v = 0. Then for any u ∈ Srh v, we have (h - μ + r)N u = 0. But by Theorem 5.1,\n·\nthe real parts of generalized eigenvalues of h in M are bounded below. Hence Srh v = 0 for\n·\nlarge enough r, as desired.\n\nAccording to Proposition 5.2, the functor E can be alternatively defined by setting E(M)\nto be the subspace of M which is locally nilpotent under the action of h.\nThis gives rise to the following generalization of E: for any λ ∈ h∗\nOc(G, h) →Oc(G, h)λ by setting Eλ(M) to be the space of generalized eigenvectors of\nC[h∗]G in M with eigenvalue λ.\nwe define the functor\nEλ :\nThis way, we have E0 = E.\nWe can also define the generalized Jacquet functor Jλ\nformula Jλ(M) = Eλ(M). Then we have J0\nJλ to Oc(G, h)λ is the identity functor.\n: Oc(G, h) →Oc(G, h)λ by the\n= J , and one can show that the restriction of\n5.5. The centralizer construction.

Completion of rational Cherednik algebras at arbitrary points of h/G. The\nfollowing result is, in essence, a consequence of the geometric approach to rational Cherednik\nalgebras, described in Subsection 5.1. It should be regarded as a direct generalization to the\ncase of Cherednik algebras of Theorem 8.6 of [L] for affine Hecke algebras.\nLet b ∈ h. Abusing notation, denote the restriction of c to the set Sb of reflections in Gb\nalso by c.\nTheorem 5.4. One has a natural isomorphism\nH1,c\nd\nH\nH\n,c\n,c\nθ :\n(G, h)b → Z(G, Gb,\n(Gb, h)0),\ndefined by the following formulas. Suppose that f ∈ P = FunGb (G,\n(Gb, h)0). Then\n(θ(u)f)(w) = f(wu), u ∈ G;\nfor any α ∈ h∗,\n(b)\n(θ(xα)f)(w) = (xwα + (wα, b))f(w),\nwhere xα ∈ h∗ ⊂ H1,c(G, h), xα\n(b) ∈ h∗ ⊂ H1,c(Gb, h) are the elements corresponding to α; and\nfor any a ∈ h,\n2cs\nαs(wa)\n(b)\n(5.1)\n(θ(ya)f)(w) = ywaf(w) -\n(f(w) - f(sw)).\ns∈S:s/∈Gb 1 - λs xα\n(b\ns\n) + αs(b)\nwhere ya ∈ h ⊂ H1,c(G, h), ya\n(b) ∈ h ⊂ H1,c(Gb, h).\nProof. The proof is by a direct computation. We note that in the last formula, the fraction\nαs(wa)/(xα\n(b\ns\n) + αs(b)) is viewed as a power series (i.e., an element of C[[h]]), and that only\nthe entire sum, and not each summand separately, is in the centralizer algebra.\n\nRemark. Let us explain how to see the existence of θ without writing explicit formulas,\nand how to guess the formula (5.1) for θ. It is explained in [E1] (see e.g. [E1], Section\n2.9) that the sheaf of algebras obtained by sheafification of H1,c(G, h) over h/G is generated\n(on every affine open set in h/G) by regular functions on h, elements of G, and Dunkl\noperators. Therefore, this statement holds for formal neighborhoods, i.e., it is true on the\nformal neighborhood of the image in h/G of any point b ∈ h. However, looking at the formula\nfor Dunkl operators near b, we see that the summands corresponding to s ∈S, s ∈/ Gb are\nactually regular at b, so they can be safely deleted without changing the generated algebra\n(as all regular functions on the formal neighborhood of b are included into the system of\ngenerators). But after these terms are deleted, what remains is nothing but the Dunkl\noperators for (Gb, h), which, together with functions on the formal neighborhood of b and\nthe group Gb, generate the completion of H1,c(Gb, h). This gives a construction of θ without\nusing explicit formulas.\nAlso, this argument explains why θ should be defined by formula (5.1) of Theorem 5.4.\nIndeed, what this formula does is just restores the terms with s / Gb that have been\n∈\npreviously deleted.\nThe map θ defines an equivalence of categories\nH1,c\nH1,c\nθ ∗ :\n(G, h)b - mod\nZ(G, Gb,\n→\n(Gb, h)0) - mod.\n\nd\nb\nc\nc\nd\n\nc\nc\nCorollary 5.5. We have a natural equivalence of categories\nψλ : Oc(G, h)λ →Oc(Gλ, h/hGλ )0.\nProof. The category Oc(G, h)λ is the category of modules over H1,c(G, h) which are finitely\ngenerated over C[h] and extend by continuity to the completion of the algebra H1,c(G, h)\nat λ. So it follows from Theorem 5.4 that we have an equivalence Oc(G, h)λ →Oc(Gλ, h)0.\nComposing this equivalence with the equivalence ζ : Oc(Gλ, h)0 →Oc(Gλ, h/hGλ )0, we obtain\nthe desired equivalence ψλ.\n\nRemark 5.6.

Parabolic induction and restriction functors for rational Cherednik algebras.\nTheorem 5.4 allows us to define analogs of parabolic restriction functors for rational Chered\nnik algebras.\nNamely, let b ∈ h, and Gb = G0. Define a functor Resb : Oc(G, h)0 →Oc(G0, h/hG0 )0 by\nthe formula\nResb(M) = (ζ\nE\nθ∗)(c\nI-1\nMb).\n*\n*\n*\nWe can also define the parabolic induction functors in the opposite direction. Namely, let\nN ∈Oc(G0, h/hG0 )0.

The functor Indb is right adjoint to Resb.\nProof. We have\nHom(Resb(M), N) = Hom((ζ\nE\nθ∗)(c\nI-1\nθ∗)(c\nI-1\nMb), N) = Hom((E\nMb), ζ-1(N))\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n= Hom((I-1\nθ∗)(c\nζ\\\n-1(N)0\nMb, (θ-1\nI)(ζ\\\n-1(N)0))\nMb),\n) = Hom(c\n*\n∗ *\n= Hom(M, (Eb\nθ-1\nI)(ζ\\\n-1(N)0)) = Hom(M, Indb(N)).\n* ∗ *\nAt the end we used Proposition 5.8.\n\nThen we can obtain the following corollary easily.\nCorollary 5.13. The functor Resb maps projective objects to projective ones, and the functor\nIndb maps injective objects to injective ones.\nWe can also define functors resλ : Oc(G, h)0 →Oc(G0, h/hG0 )0 and indλ : Oc(G0, h/hG0 )0 →\n(G, h)0, attached to λ ∈ h∗G0 , by\nOc\nreg\nresλ := + * Resλ *+, indλ := + * Indλ *+,\nwhere + is as in Subsection 5.3.\nCorollary 5.14. The functors resλ, indλ are exact. The functor indλ is left adjoint to resλ.\nThe functor indλ maps projective objects to projective ones, and the functor resλ injective\nobjects to injective ones.\nProof. Easy to see from the definition of the functors and the Theorem 5.12.\n\nWe also have the following proposition, whose proof is straightforward.\nProposition 5.15. We have\nindλ(N) = (J * ψ-1)(N),\nand\nresλ(M) = (ψλ *\nM),\nEλ)(c\nλ\nwhere ψλ is defined in Corollary 5.5.\n\nd\nd\nd\nc\nc\n5.9. Some evaluations of the parabolic induction and restriction functors. For\ngeneric c, the category Oc(G, h) is semisimple, and naturally equivalent to the category\nRepG of finite dimensional representations of G, via the functor τ 7→ Mc(G, h, τ). (If G is\na Coxeter group, the exact set of such c (which are called regular) is known from [GGOR]\nand [Gy]).\nProposition 5.16.\n(i) Suppose that c is generic. Upon the above identification, the\nfunctors Indb, indλ and Resb, resλ go to the usual induction and restriction functors\nbetween categories RepG and RepG0. In other words, we have\nResb(Mc(G, h, τ)) = ⊕ξ∈cnτξMc(G0, h/hG0 , ξ),\nG0\nand\nIndb(Mc(G0, h/hG0 , ξ)) = ⊕τ∈GbnτξMc(G, h, τ),\nwhere nτξ is the multiplicity of occurrence of ξ in τ|G0 , and similarly for resλ, indλ.\n(ii) The equations of (i) hold at the level of Grothendieck groups for all c.\nProof. Part (i) is easy for c = 0, and is obtained for generic c by a deformation argument.\nPart (ii) is also obtained by deformation argument, taking into account that the functors\nResb and Indb are exact and flat with respect to c.\n\nExample 5.17. Suppose that G0 = 1. Then Resb(M) is the fiber of M at b, while Indb(C) =\nPKZ , the object defined in [GGOR], which is projective and injective (see Remark 5.22). This\nshows that Proposition 5.16 (i) does not hold for special c, as PKZ is not, in general, a direct\nsum of standard modules.\n5.10. Dependence of the functor Resb on b. Let G0 ⊂ G be a parabolic subgroup. In\nthe construction of the functor Resb, the point b can be made a variable which belongs to\nthe open set hG0 .\nreg\nd\nG\nhreg\nh/G be the natural map (note that this map is an etale covering of the image with\nbe the formal neighborhood of the locally closed set hG0\nreg\nNamely, let\nin h, and let\nreg →\nd\nG\nh\nπ :\nH1,c\nbe the pullback of the sheaf H1,c,G,h under π. We can regard it as a sheaf of algebras over\nhG0 . Similarly to Theorem 5.4 we have an isomorphism\nreg\nH1,c\nH1,c\nthe Galois group NG(G0)/G0, where NG(G0) is the normalizer of G0 in G). Let\n(G, h)hG0\nreg\n(G0, h/hG0 )0)ˆ\nreg\n⊗D(hG0\nZ(G, G0,\nθ :\n(G, h)hG0\nreg\n),\n→\nwhere D(hG0 ) is the sheaf of differential operators on hG0 , and ⊗ˆ is an appropriate completion\nreg\nreg\nof the tensor product.\nThus, repeating the construction of Resb, we can define the functor\nRes : Oc(G, h)0 →Oc(G0, h/hG0 )0 Loc(hG0 ),\nreg\nwhere Loc(hG0 ) stands for the category of local systems (i.e. O-coherent D-modules) on hG0 .\nreg\nreg\nThis functor has the property that Resb is the fiber of Res at b. Namely, the functor Res is\ndefined by the formula\nRes(M) = (E\nI-1\nθ∗)(MhG0\nreg ),\n*\n*\nis the restriction of the sheaf M on h to the formal neighborhood of hG0\nreg\nwhere MhG0\nreg\n.\n\nRemark 5.18. If G0 is the trivial group, the functor Res is just the KZ functor from [GGOR],\nwhich we will discuss later. Thus, Res is a relative version of the KZ functor.\nRemark 5.19. Note that the object Res(M) is naturally equivariant under the group\nNG(G0)/G0.\nThus, we see that the functor Resb does not depend on b, up to an isomorphism. A similar\nstatement is true for the functors Indb, resλ, indλ.\nConjecture 5.20. For any b ∈ h, λ ∈ h∗ such that Gb = Gλ, we have isomorphisms of\nfunctors Resb ∼\n= indλ.\n= resλ, Indb ∼\nRemark 5.21. Conjecture 5.20 would imply that Indb is left adjoint to Resb, and that Resb\nmaps injective objects to injective ones, while Indb maps projective objects to projective\nones.\nRemark 5.22. If b and λ are generic (i.e., Gb = Gλ = 1) then the conjecture holds. Indeed,\nin this case the conjecture reduces to showing that we have an isomorphism of functors\nFiberb(M) ∼Fiberλ(M +)∗ (M ∈Oc\nSince both functors are exact functors to the\n=\n(G, h)).\ncategory of vector spaces, it suffices to check that dim Fiberb(M) = dim Fiberλ(M +). But this\nis true because both dimensions are given by the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial\nof M (characterizing the growth of M).\nIt is important to mention, however, that although Resb is isomorphic to Resb0 if Gb = Gb0 ,\nthis isomorphism is not canonical. So let us examine the dependence of Resb on b a little\nmore carefully.\nTheorem 5.16 implies that if c is generic, then\nRes(Mc(G, h, τ)) = ⊕ξMc(G0, h/hG0 , ξ) ⊗Lτξ,\nwhere Lτξ is a local system on hG0 of rank nτξ. Let us characterize the local system Lτξ\nreg\nexplicitly.\nProposition 5.23. The local system Lτξ is given by the connection on the trivial bundle\ngiven by the formula\nX\n2cs dαs\nr = d -\n(1 - s).\ns∈S:s/∈G0 1 - λs αs\nwith values in HomG0 (ξ, τ|G0 ).\nProof. This follows immediately from formula (5.1).\n\nDefinition 5.24. We will call the connection of Proposition 5.23 the parabolic KZ (Knizhnik-\nZamolodchikov) connection.\nExample 5.25. Let G = Sn and G0 = Sn1 × · · · × Snk with n1 + · · · + nk = n. In this case,\nthere is only one parameter c.\nLet h = Cn be the permutation representation of G. Then\nhG0 = (Cn)G0 = {v ∈ h v = (z1, . . . , z1, z2, . . . , z2, . . . , zk, . . . , zk)}.\n|\n|\n{z\n} |\n{z\n}\n|\n{z\n}\nn1\nn2\nnk\n\nX\nX\nQ\nThus, the parabolic KZ connection on the trivial bundle with fiber being a representation τ\nof Sn has the form\nX\nn1+···+np\nn1+···+nq\nd - c\ndzp - dzq (1 - sij ).\n1≤p<q≤k i=n1+\n+np-1+1 j=n1+\n+nq-1+1 zp - zq\n···\n···\nSo the differential equations for a flat section F (z) of this bundle have the form\n···\n···\n∂F\nX\nn1+X+np\nn1+X+nq\n(1 - sij )F\n= c\n.\n∂zp\nq6=p i=n1+···+np-1+1 j=n1+···+nq-1+1\nzp - zq\nSo F (z) = G(z)\np<q(zp - zq)cnpnq , where the function G satisfies the differential equation\n∂G\nX\nn1+X+np\nn1+X\n···+nq\nsij G\n···\n.\n∂zp\n= -c\nq=p i=n1+\n+np-1+1 j=n1+\n+nq-1+1 zp - zq\n···\n···\nLet τ = V ⊗n where V is a finite dimensional space with dim V = N (this class of repre\nsentations contains as summands all irreducible representations of Sn). Let Vp = V ⊗np , so\nthat τ = V1 ⊗· · · ⊗ Vk. Then the equation for G can be written as\n∂G\nX ΩpqG\n∂zp\n= -c\nzp - zq\n,\np = 1, . . . , k,\nq=p\nPN\nwhere Ω =\nEs,t ⊗ Et,s is the Casimir element for glN (Ei,j is the N by N matrix with\ns,t=1\nthe only 1 at the (i, j)-th place, and the rest of the entries being 0).\nThis is nothing but the well known Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov system of equations of the\nWZW conformal field theory, for the Lie algebra glN , see [EFK]. (Note that the repre\nsentations Vi are \"the most general\" in the sense that any irreducible finite dimensional\nrepresentation of glN occurs in V ⊗r for some r, up to tensoring with a character.)\nThis motivates the term \"parabolic KZ connection\".\n5.11. Supports of modules. The following two basic propositions are proved in [Gi1],\nSection 6. We will give different proofs of them, based on the restriction functors.\nProposition 5.26. Consider the stratification of h with respect to stabilizers of points in G.\nThen the (set-theoretical) support SuppM of any object M of Oc(G, h) in h is a union of\nstrata of this stratification.\nProof. This follows immediately from the existence of the flat connection along the set of\npoints b with a fixed stabilizer G0 on the bundle Resb(M).\n\nProposition 5.27. For any irreducible object M in Oc(G, h), SuppM/G is an irreducible\nalgebraic variety.\nProof. Let X be a component of SuppM/G. Let M 0 be the subspace of elements of M\nwhose restriction to a neighborhood of a generic point of X is zero. It is obvious that M 0 is\nan H1,c(G, h)-submodule in M. By definition, it is a proper submodule. Therefore, by the\nirreducibility of M, we have M 0 = 0. Now let f ∈ C[h]G be a function that vanishes on X.\nThen there exists a positive integer N such that f N maps M to M 0, hence acts by zero on\nM. This implies that SuppM/G = X, as desired.\n\nPropositions 5.26 and 5.27 allow us to attach to every irreducible module M ∈Oc(G, h),\na conjugacy class of parabolic subgroups, CM ∈ Par(G), namely, the conjugacy class of the\nstabilizer of a generic point of the support of M. Also, for a parabolic subgroup G0 ⊂ G,\ndenote by X (G0) the set of points b ∈ h whose stabilizer contains a subgroup conjugate to\nG0.\nThe following proposition is immediate.\nProposition 5.28.\n(i) Let M ∈Oc(G, h)0 be irreducible. If b is such that Gb ∈ CM ,\nthen Resb(M) is a nonzero finite dimensional module over H1,c(Gb, h/hGb ).\n(ii) Conversely, let b ∈ h, and L be a finite dimensional module H1,c(Gb, h/hGb ). Then\nthe support of Indb(L) in h is X (Gb).\nLet FD(G, h) be the set of c for which H1,c(G, h) admits a finite dimensional representation.\nCorollary 5.29. Let G0 be a parabolic subgroup of G. Then X (G0) is the support of some\nirreducible representation from Oc(G, h)0 if and only if c ∈ FD(G0, h/hG0 ).\nProof. Immediate from Proposition 5.28.\n\nExample 5.30. Let G = Sn, h = Cn-1 . In this case, the set Par(G) is the set of partitions\nof n. Assume that c = r/m, (r, m) = 1, 2 ≤ m ≤ n. By a result of [BEG], finite dimensional\nrepresentations of Hc(G, h) exist if and only if m = n. Thus the only possible classes CM\nfor irreducible modules M have stabilizers Sm × · · · × Sm, i.e., correspond to partitions into\nparts, where each part is equal to m or 1. So there are [n/m] + 1 possible supports for\nmodules, where [a] denotes the integer part of a.\n5.12. Notes. Our discussion of the geometric approach to rational Cherednik algebras in\nSection 5.1 follows [E1] and Section 2.2 of [BE]. Our exposition in the other sections follows\nthe corresponding parts of the paper [BE].\n\n6. The Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov functor\n6.1. Braid groups and Hecke algebras. Let G be a complex reflection group and let h\nbe its reflection representation. For any reflection hyperplane H ⊂ h, its pointwise stabilizer\nis a cyclic group of order mH . Fix a collection of nonzero constants q1,H , . . . , qmH -1,H which\nare G-invariant, namely, if H and H0 are conjugate to each other under some element in G,\nthen qi,H = qi,H0 for i = 1, . . . , mH - 1.\nLet BG = π1(hreg/G, x0) be the braid group of G, and TH ∈ BG be a representative of\nthe conjugacy class defined by a small circle around the image of H in h/G oriented in the\ncounterclockwise direction.\nThe following theorem follows from elementary algebraic topology.\nProposition 6.1. The group G is the quotient of the braid group BG by the relations\nT mH\nH\n= 1\nfor all reflection hyperplanes H.\nProof. See, e.g., [BMR] Proposition 2.17.\n\nDefinition 6.2. The Hecke algebra of G is defined to be\nmY\nH -1\nHq(G) = C[BG]/h(TH - 1)\n(TH - exp(2πij/mH )qj,H ), for all Hi.\nj=1\nThus, by Proposition 6.1 we have an isomorphism\nH1(G) ∼= CG.\nSo Hq(G) is a deformation of CG.\nExample 6.3 (Coxeter group case). Now let W be a Coxeter group. Let S be the set of\nreflections and let αs = 0 be the reflection hyperplane corresponding to s ∈S. The Hecke\nalgebra Hq(W ) is the quotient of C[BW ] by the relations\n(Ts - 1)(Ts + qs) = 0,\nfor all reflections s where Ts is a small counterclockwise circle around the image of the\nhyperplane αs = 0 in h/W .\n6.2. KZ functors. For a complex reflection group G, let Loc(hreg) be the category of local\nsystems (i.e., O-coherent D-modules) on hreg, and let Loc(hreg)G be the category of G\nequivariant local systems on hreg, i.e. of local systems on hreg/G.\nSuppose that G0 = 1 is the trivial subgroup in G. Then the restriction functor defined in\nSection 5.10 defines a functor Res : Oc(G, h)0 → Loc(hreg/G). Also, we have the monodromy\nfunctor Mon : Loc(hreg/G) ∼Rep(BG). The composition of these two functors is a functor\n=\nfrom Oc(G, h)0 to Rep(BG), which is exactly the KZ functor defined in [GGOR]. We will\ndenote this functor by KZ.\nTheorem 6.4 (Ginzburg, Guay, Opdam, Rouquier, [GGOR]). The KZ functor factors\nthrough\nRepHq(G), where\nmX\nH -1 c ` (1 - e2πij`/mH )\ns\nqj,H = exp(2πibj,H /mH ),\nand bj,H = 2\nH\n.\n1 - e-2πi`/mH\n`=1\n\nM\nM\nProof. Assume first that c is generic. Then the category Oc(G, h)0 is semisimple, with simple\nobjects Mc(τ), so it is enough to check the statement on Mc(τ). Consider the trivial bundle\nover hreg with fiber τ. The KZ connection on it has the form\nX 2cs dαs\nd -\n1 - λs αs\n(1 - s).\ns∈S\nThe residue of the connection form of this connection on the hyperplane H on the j-th\nirreducible representation of Z/mH Z is\nmX\nH -1\nc `\ns\n1 - e-2\nH\nπi`/mH (1 - e 2πij`/mH ).\n`=1\nTherefore, the monodromy operator around this hyperplane is diagonalizable, and the eigen\nvalues of this operator are 1 and exp(2πij/mH )qj,H , as desired.\nFor special c, introduce the generalized Verma module\nMc,n(τ) = Hc(G, h) ⊗CGnSh (τ ⊗ Sh/m n+1),\nwhere m\nSh is the maximal ideal of 0, n\n0. Clearly, Mc,0 = Mc(τ). Moreover,\n⊂\n≥\nMc,n\n(G, h)0 for any n, since it has a finite filtration whose successive quotients are\n∈Oc\nVerma modules.\nTheorem 6.5. For large enough n, Mc,n(CG) contains a direct summand which is a projec\ntive generator of Oc(G, h)0.\nProof. From the definition, Mc,n = Sh∗ ⊗ CG ⊗ Sh/mn+1 . Let ∂ be the degree operator on\nMc,n(CG) with deg h∗ = 1, deg h = -1, and deg G = 0, i.e., we have\n[∂, x] = x, [∂, y] = -y, where x ∈ h∗, y ∈ h.\nSo h - ∂ is a module endomorphism of Mc,n(CG) where h is the operator defined in (3.2).\nMoreover, h - ∂ acts locally finitely. In particular, we have a decomposition of Mc,n(CG)\ninto generalized eigenspaces of h - ∂:\n(CG) =\nM β (CG).\nMc,n\nc,n\nβ∈C\nWe have\nHom(Mc,n(CG), N) = {vectors in N which are killed by m n+1},\nand\nHom(M β (CG), N) = {vectors in N which are killed by m n+1\nc,n\nand are generalized eigenvectors of h with generalized eigenvalue β}.\nLet\nΣ\nP =\n{hc(τ)|τ is a irreducible representation of G}\n(recall\nthat\n(τ) = dim h\n2cs s τ ), and let\nhc\n-\ns∈S 1-λs |\nM Σ (CG) =\nM β (CG).\nc,n\nc,n\nβ∈Σ\nClaim: for large n, M Σ (CG) is a projective generator of Oc(G, h)0.\nc,n\n\nProof of the claim. First, for any β, there exists n such that M Σ (CG) is projective (since\nc,n\nthe condition of being killed by mn+1 is vacuous for large n).\nSecondly, consider the functor Hom(M Σ (CG), -). For any module N ∈Oc(G, h)0, if\nc,n\nHom(M Σ (CG), N) = 0, then ⊕β∈ΣN[β] = 0. So N = 0. Thus this functor does not kill\nc,n\nnonzero objects, and so M Σ (CG) is a generator.\n\nc,n\nTheorem 6.5 is proved.\n\nCorollary 6.6.\n(i) Oc(G, h)0 has enough projectives, so it is equivalent to the category\nof modules over a finite dimensional algebra.\n(ii) Any object of Oc(G, h)0 is a quotient of a multiple of Mc,n(CG) for large enough n.\nProof. Directly from the definition and the above theorem.\n\nNow we can finish the proof of Theorem 6.4.\nWe have shown that for generic c,\nKZ(Mc,n(CG)) ∈ RepHq(G). Hence this is true for any c, since Mc,n(CG) is a flat fam\nily of modules over Hc(G, h). Then, KZ(M) is a Hq(G)-module for all M, since any M is a\nquotient of Mc,n(CG) and the functor KZ is exact.\n\nCorollary 6.7 (Brou e, Malle, Rouquier, [BMR]). Let qj,H = exp(tj,H ) where tj,H 's are\nformal parameters. Then Hq(G) is a free module over C[[tj,H ]] of rank |G|.\nProof. We have\nHq(G)/(t) = H1(G) = CG.\nSo it remains to show that Hq(G) is free. To show this, it is sufficient to show that any\nτ ∈ IrrepG admits a flat deformation τq to a representation of Hq(G). We can define this\ndeformation by letting τq = KZ(Mc(τ )).\n\nRemark 6.8. 1. The validity of this Corollary in characteristic zero implies that it is also\nvalid over a field positive characteristic.\n2. It is not known in general if the Corollary holds for numerical q (even generically). This\nis a conjecture of Brou e, Malle, and Rouquier. But it is known for many cases (including all\nCoxeter groups).\n3. The proof of the Corollary is analytic (it is based on the notion of monodromy). There\nis no known algebraic proof, except in special cases, and in the case of Coxeter groups, which\nwe'll discuss later.\n6.3. The image of the KZ functor. First, let us recall the definition of a quotient category.\nLet A be an abelian category and B ⊂A a full abelian subcategory.\nDefinition 6.9. B is a Serre subcategory if it is closed under subquotients and extensions\n(i.e., if two terms in a short exact sequence are in B, so is the third one).\nIf B ⊂A is a Serre subcategory, one can define a category A/B as follows:\nobjects in A/B = objects in A,\nHomA/B(X, Y ) =\nlim\nHomA(X0, Y/Y 0).\n-→\nY 0,X/X0∈B\nThe category A/B is an abelian category with the following universal property: any exact\nfunctor F : A →C that kills B must factor through A/B.\n\nNow let Oc(G, h)tor be the full subcategory of Oc(G, h)0 consisting of modules supported\non the reflection hyperplanes. It is a Serre subcategory, and ker(KZ) = Oc(G, h)tor\n0 . Thus\nwe have a functor:\nKZ : Oc(G, h)0/Oc(G, h)tor\nRepHq(G).\n0 →\nTheorem 6.10 (Ginzburg, Guay, Opdam, Rouquier, [GGOR]). If dim Hq(G) = |G|, the\nfunctor KZ is an equivalence of categories.\nProof. See [GGOR], Theorem 5.14.\n\n6.4. Example: the symmetric group Sn. Let h = Cn , G = Sn. Then we have (for\nq ∈ C∗):\nHq(Sn) = hT1, . . . , Tn-1i/hthe braid relations and (Ti - 1)(Ti + q) = 0i.\nThe following facts are known:\n(1) dim Hq(Sn) = n!;\n(2) Hq(Sn) is semisimple if and only if ord(q) = 2, 3, . . . , n.\nNow suppose q is generic. Let λ be a partition of n. Then we can define an Hq(Sn)\nmodule Sλ, the Specht module for the Hecke algebra in the sense of [DJ]. This is a certain\ndeformation of the classical irreducible Specht module for the symmetric group. The Specht\nmodule carries an inner product h·, ·i. Denote Dλ = Sλ/Radh·, ·i.\nTheorem 6.11 (Dipper, James, [DJ]). Dλ is either an irreducible Hq(Sn)-module, or 0.\nDλ = 0 if and only if λ is e-regular where e = ord(q) (i.e., every part of λ occurs less than\ne times).\nProof. See [DJ], Theorem 6.3, 6.8.\n\nNow let Mc(λ) be the Verma module associated to the Specht module for Sn and Lc(λ)\nbe its irreducible quotient. Then we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 6.12. If c ≤ 0, then KZ(Mc(λ)) = Sλ and KZ(Lc(λ)) = Dλ.\nProof. See Section 6.2 of [GGOR].\n\nCorollary 6.13. If c ≤ 0, then SuppLc(λ) = Cn if and only if λ is e-regular. If c > 0,\nthen SuppLc(λ) = Cn if and only if λ∨ is e-regular, or equivalently, λ is e-restricted (i.e.,\nλi - λi+1 < e for i = 1, . . . , n - 1).\nProof. Directly from the definition and the above theorem.\n\n6.5. Notes. The references for this section are [GGOR], [BMR].\n\n7. Rational Cherednik algebras and Hecke algebras for varieties with\ngroup actions\n7.1. Twisted differential operators. Let us recall the theory of twisted differential oper\nators (see [BB], section 2).\nLet X be a smooth affine algebraic variety over C. Given a closed 2-form ω on X, the\nalgebra Dω(X) of differential operators on X twisted by ω can be defined as the algebra\ngenerated by OX and \"Lie derivatives\" Lv, v ∈ Vect(X), with defining relations\nfLv = Lfv, [Lv, f] = Lvf, [Lv, Lw] = L[v,w] + ω(v, w).\nThis algebra depends only on the cohomology class [ω] of ω, and equals the algebra D(X)\nof usual differential operators on X if [ω] = 0.\nAn important special case of twisted differential operators is the algebra of differential\noperators on a line bundle. Namely, let L be a line bundle on X. Since X is affine, L admits\nan algebraic connection r with curvature ω, which is a closed 2-form on X. Then it is easy\nto show that the algebra D(X, L) of differential operators on L is isomorphic to Dω(X).\nIf the variety X is smooth but not necessarily affine, then (sheaves of) algebras of twisted\ndifferential operators are classified by the space H2(X, Ω≥1), where Ω≥1 is the two-step com-\nX\nX\nplex of sheaves Ω1\nX\nΩX\n2,cl, given by the De Rham differential acting from 1-forms to closed\n→\n2-forms (sitting in degrees 1 and 2, respectively). If X is projective then this space is\nisomorphic to H2,0(X, C) ⊕ H1,1(X, C). We refer the reader to [BB], Section 2, for details.\nRemark 7.1. One can show that Dω(X) is the universal deformation of D(X) (see [E1]).\n7.2. Some algebraic geometry preliminaries. Let Z be a smooth hypersurface in a\nsmooth affine variety X. Let i : Z\nX be the corresponding closed embedding. Let\n→\nN denote the normal bundle of Z in X (a line bundle). Let OX (Z) denote the module\nof regular functions on X \\ Z which have a pole of at most first order at Z. Then we\nhave a natural map of OX -modules φ : OX (Z)\ni∗N. Indeed, we have a natural residue\nmap η :\nΩ1\nX → i∗OZ (where Ω1\n→\nis the module of 1-forms), hence a map\nOX (Z) ⊗OX\nX\nη0 : OX (Z) → i∗OZ ⊗OX TX = i∗(TX|Z ) (where TX is the tangent bundle). The map\nφ is obtained by composing η0 with the natural projection TX|Z → N.\nWe have an exact sequence of OX -modules:\nφ\n0 →OX →OX (Z) → i∗N\n-\n→\nThus we have a natural surjective map of OX -modules ξZ : TX →OX (Z)/OX .\n7.3. The Cherednik algebra of a variety with a finite group action. We will now\ngeneralize the definition of Ht,c(G, h) to the global case. Let X be an affine algebraic variety\nover C, and G be a finite group of automorphisms of X. Let E be a G-invariant subspace\nof the space of closed 2-forms on X, which projects isomorphically to H2(X, C). Consider\nthe algebra G n OT ∗X , where T ∗X is the cotangent bundle of X. We are going to define a\ndeformation Ht,c,ω(G, X) of this algebra parametrized by\n(1) complex numbers t,\n(2) G-invariant functions c on the (finite) set S of pairs s = (Y, g), where g ∈ G, and Y\nis a connected component of the set of fixed points Xg such that codimY = 1, and\n(3) elements ω ∈ EG = H2(X, C)G .\n\nP\nIf all the parameters are zero, this algebra will conicide with G n OT ∗X .\nLet t, c = {c(Y, g)}, ω ∈ EG be variables. Let Dω/t(X)r be the algebra (over C[t, t-1, ω])\nof twisted (by ω/t) differential operators on X with rational coefficients.\nDefinition 7.2. A Dunkl-Opdam operator for (X, G) is an element of Dω/t(X)r[c] given by\nthe formula\nX 2c(Y, g)\n(7.1)\nD := tLv -\n1 - λY,g\n· fY (x) · (1 - g),\n(Y,g)∈S\nwhere λY,g is the eigenvalue of g on the conormal bundle to Y , v ∈ Γ(X, T X) is a vector\nfield on X, and fY ∈OX (Z) is an element of the coset ξY (v) ∈OX (Z)/OX (recall that ξY\nis defined in Subsection 7.2).\nDefinition 7.3. The algebra Ht,c,ω(X, G) is the subalgebra of G n Dω/t(X)r[c] generated\n(over C[t, c, ω]) by the function algebra OX , the group G, and the Dunkl-Opdam operators.\nBy specializing t, c, ω to numerical values, we can define a family of algebras over C, which\nwe will also denote Ht,c,ω(G, X). Note that when we set t = 0, the term tLv does not become\n0 but turns into the classical momentum.\nDefinition 7.4. Ht,c,ω(G, X) is called the Cherednik algebra of the orbifold X/G.\nRemark 7.5. One has H1,0,ω(G, X) = G n Dω(X). Also, if λ 6= 0 then Hλt,λc,λω(G, X) =\nHt,c,ω(G, X).\nExample 7.6. X = h is a vector space and G is a subgroup in GL(h). Let v be a constant\nvector field, and let fY (x) = (αY , v)/αY (x), where αY ∈ h∗ is a nonzero functional vanishing\non Y . Then the operator D is just the usual Dunkl-Opdam operator Dv in the complex\nreflection case (see Section 2.5). This implies that all the Dunkl-Opdam operators in the\nsense of Definition 7.2 have the form\nfiDyi + a, where fi ∈ C[h], a ∈ G n C[h], and Dyi\nare the usual Dunkl-Opdam operators (for some basis yi of h). So the algebra Ht,c(G, h) =\nHt,c,0(G, X) is the rational Cherednik algebra for (G, h), see Section 3.1.\nThe algebra Ht,c,ω(G, X) has a filtration F - which is defined on generators by deg(OX ) =\ndeg(G) = 0, deg(D) = 1 for Dunkl-Opdam operators D.\nTheorem 7.7 (the PBW theorem). We have\ngrF (Ht,c,ω(G, X)) = G n O(T ∗X)[t, c, ω].\nProof. Suppose first that X = h is a vector space and G is a subgroup in GL(h). Then, as\nwe mentioned, Ht,c,ω(G, h) = Ht,c(G, h) is the rational Cherednik algebra for G, h. So in this\ncase the theorem is true.\nNow consider arbitrary X. We have a homomorphism of graded algebras\nψ : grF (Ht,c,ω(G, X)) → G n O(T ∗X)[t, c, ω]\n(the principal symbol homomorphism).\nThe homomorphism ψ is clearly surjective, and our job is to show that it is injective (this\nis the nontrivial part of the proof). In each degree, ψ is a morphism of finitely generated\nOG -modules. Therefore, to check its injectivity, it suffices to check the injectivity on the\nformal neighborhood of each point z ∈ X/G.\nLet x be a preimage of z in X, and Gx be the stabilizer of x in G. Then Gx acts on the\nformal neighborhood Ux of x in X.\nX\n\nLemma 7.8. Any action of a finite group on a formal polydisk over C is linearizable.\nProof. Let D be a formal polydisk over C. Suppose we have an action of a finite group G\non D. Then we have a group homomorphism:\nρ : G\nAut(D) = GLn(C) n AutU (D),\n→\nwhere AutU (D) is the group of unipotent automorphisms of D (i.e. those whose derivative\nat the origin is 1), which is a prounipotent algebraic group.\nOur job is to show that the image of G under ρ can be conjugated into GLn(C). The\nobstruction to this is in the cohomology group H1(G, AutU (D)), which is trivial since G is\nfinite and AutU (D) is prounipotent over C.\n\nIt follows from Lemma 7.8 that it suffices to prove the theorem in the linear case, which\nhas been accomplished already. We are done.\n\nRemark 7.9. The following remark is meant to clarify the proof of Theorem 7.7. In the case\nX = h, the proof of Theorem 7.7 is based, essentially, on the (fairly nontrivial) fact that the\nusual Dunkl-Opdam operators Dv commute with each other. It is therefore very important\nto note that in contrast with the linear case, for a general X we do not have any natural\ncommuting family of Dunkl-Opdam operators. Instead, the operators (7.1) satisfy a weaker\nproperty, which is still sufficient to validate the PBW theorem. This property says that if\nD1, D2, D3 are Dunkl-Opdam operators corresponding to vector fields v1, v2, v3 := [v1, v2]\nand some choices of the functions fY , then [D1, D2] - D3 ∈ G n O(X) (i.e., it has no poles).\nTo prove this property, it is sufficient to consider the case when X is a formal polydisk, with\na linear action of G. But in this case everything follows from the commutativity of the usual\nDunkl operators Dv.\nExample 7.10.\n(1) Suppose G = 1. Then for t = 0,\nHt,0,ω(G, X) = Dω/t(X).\n(2) Suppose G is a Weyl group and X = H the corresponding torus. Then H1,c,0(G, H)\nis called the trigonometric Cherednik algebra.\n7.4. Globalization. Let X be any smooth algebraic variety, and G ⊂ Aut(X). Assume\nthat X admits a cover by affine G-invariant open sets. Then the quotient variety X/G\nexists.\nFor any affine open set U in X/G, let U 0 be the preimage of U in X. Then we can\ndefine the algebra Ht,c,0(G, U 0) as above. If U ⊂ V , we have an obvious restriction map\nHt,c,0(G, V 0)\nHt,c,0(G, U 0). The gluing axiom is clearly satisfied. Thus the collection of\n→\nalgebras Ht,c,0(G, U 0) can be extended (by sheafification) to a sheaf of algebras on X/G. We\nare going to denote this sheaf by Ht,c,0,G,X and call it the sheaf of Cherednik algebras on\nX/G. Thus, Ht,c,0,G,X (U) = Ht,c,0(G, U 0).\nSimilarly, if ψ ∈ H2(X, Ω≥1)G , we can define the sheaf of twisted Cherednik algebras\nX\nHt,c,ψ,G,X . This is done similarly to the case of twisted differential operators (which is the\ncase G = 1).\nRemark 7.11.\n(1) The construction of Ht,c,ω(G, X) and the PBW theorem extend in a\nstraightforward manner to the case when the ground field is not C but an algebraically\nclosed field k of positive characteristic, provided that the order of the group G is\nrelatively prime to the characteristic.\n\nX\n(2) The construction and main properties of the (sheaves of) Cherednik algebras of alge\nbraic varieties can be extended without significant changes to the case when X is a\ncomplex analytic manifold, and G is not necessarily finite but acts properly discon\ntinuously. In the following lectures, we will often work in this generalized setting.\n7.5. Modified Cherednik algebra. It will be convenient for us to use a slight modification\nof the sheaf Ht,c,ψ,G,X . Namely, let η be a function on the set of conjugacy classes of Y such\nthat (Y, g) ∈S. We define Ht,c,η,ψ,G,X in the same way as Ht,c,ψ,G,X except that the Dunkl-\nOpdam operators are defined by the formula\nX\n2c(Y, g)\nX\n(7.2)\nD := tLv +\nfY (x)\n(g - 1) +\nfY (x)η(Y ).\n(Y,g)∈S\n1 - λY,g\nY\nThe following result shows that this modification is in fact tautological. Let ψY be the class\nin H2(X, Ω≥1) defined by the line bundle OX (Y )-1, whose sections are functions vanishing\nX\non Y .\nProposition 7.12. One has an isomorphism\nHt,c,η,ψ,G,X → Ht,c,ψ+ P\nY η(Y )ψY ,G,X .\nProof. Let y ∈ Y and z be a function on the formal neighborhood of y such that z|Y = 0\nand dzy = 0. Extend it to a system of local formal coordinates z1 = z, z2, . . . , zd near y. A\n∂\nDunkl-Opdam operator near y for the vector field ∂z can be written in the form\n∂\nn-1 2c(Y, gm)\nm\nD = ∂z + z (\n1 - λm (g - 1) + η(Y )).\nm=1\nY,g\nConjugating this operator by the formal expression zη(Y ) := (zm)η(Y )/m, we get\nn-1\n∂\n1 X 2c(Y, gm)\nz η(Y ) * D * z-η(Y ) = ∂z + z\n1 - λm (g m - 1)\nm=1\nY,g\nThis implies the required statement.\n\nWe note that the sheaf H1,c,η,0,G,X localizes to G n DX on the complement of all the\nhypersurfaces Y . This follows from the fact that the line bundle OX (Y ) is trivial on the\ncomplement of Y .\n7.6. Orbifold Hecke algebras. Let X be a connected and simply connected complex man\nifold, and G is a discrete group of automorphisms of X which acts properly discontinuously.\nThen X/G is a complex orbifold. Let X0 ⊂ X be the set of points with trivial stabilizer. Fix\na base point x0 ∈ X0. Then the braid group of X/G is defined to be BG = π1(X0/G, x0).\nWe have an exact sequence 1\nK\nBG → G\n1.\n→\n→\n→\nNow let S be the set of pairs (Y, g) such that Y is a component of Xg of codimension 1 in\nX (such Y will be called a reflection hypersurface). For (Y, g) ∈S, let GY be the subgroup of\nG whose elements act trivially on Y . This group is obviously cyclic; let nY = |GY |. Let CY\nbe the conjugacy class in BG corresponding to a small circle going counterclockwise around\nthe image of Y in X/G, and TY be a representative in CY .\nThe following theorem follows from elementary topology:\n\nY\nTheorem 7.13. K is defined by relations TY\nnY = 1, for all reflection hypersurfaces Y (i.e.,\nK is the intersection of all normal subgroups of BG containing TY\nnY ).\nProof. See, e.g., [BMR] Proposition 2.17.\n\nFor any conjugacy class of hypersurfaces Y such that (Y, g) ∈S we introduce formal\nparameters τ1Y , . . . , τnY Y . The entire collection of these parameters will be denoted by τ.\nLet A0 = C[G].\nDefinition 7.14. We define the Hecke algebra of (G, X), denoted A = Hτ (G, X, x0), to be\nthe quotient of the group algebra of the braid group, C[BG][[τ]], by the relations\nnY\n(7.3)\n(T - e 2πji/nY e τjY ) = 0, T ∈ CY\nj=1\n(i.e., by the closed ideal in the formal series topology generated by these relations).\nThus, A is a deformation of A0.\nIt is clear that up to an isomorphism this algebra is independent on the choice of x0, so\nwe will sometimes drop x0 form the notation.\nThe main result of this section is the following theorem.\nTheorem 7.15. Assume that H2(X, C) = 0. Then A = Hτ (G, X) is a flat formal defor\nmation of A0, which means A = A0[[τ ]] as a module over C[[τ]].\nExample 7.16. Let h be a finite dimensional vector space, and G be a complex reflection\ngroup in GL(h). Then Hτ (G, h) is the Hecke algebra of G studied in [BMR]. It follows\nfrom Theorem 7.15 that this Hecke algebra is flat. This proof of flatness is in fact the same\nas the original proof of this result given in [BMR] (based on the Dunkl-Opdam-Cherednik\noperators, and explained above).\nExample 7.17. Let h be a universal covering of a maximal torus of a simply connected\nsimple Lie group G, Q∨ be the dual root lattice, and Gb = G n Q∨ be its affine Weyl group.\nThen Hτ (h, Gb) is the affine Hecke algebra. This algebra is also flat by Theorem 7.15. In\nfact, its flatness is a well known result from representation theory; our proof of flatness is\nessentially due to Cherednik [Ch].\nExample 7.18. Let G, h, Q∨ be as in the previous example, η ∈ C+ be a complex number\nwith a positive imaginary part, and Gbb = G n (Q∨ ⊕ ηQ∨) be the double affine Weyl group.\nThen Hτ (h, Gbb) is (one of the versions of) the double affine Hecke algebra of Cherednik ([Ch]),\nand it is flat by Theorem 7.15. The fact that this algebra is flat was proved by Cherednik,\nSahi, Noumi, Stokman (see [Ch],[Sa],[NoSt],[St]) using a different approach (q-deformed\nDunkl operators).\n7.7. Hecke algebras attached to Fuchsian groups. Let H be a simply connected com\nplex Riemann surface (i.e., Riemann sphere, Euclidean plane, or Lobachevsky plane), and Γ\nbe a cocompact lattice in Aut(H) (i.e., a Fuchsian group). Let Σ = H/Γ. Then Σ is a com\npact complex Riemann surface. When Γ contains elliptic elements (i.e., nontrivial elements\n\nY\nY\nY\nof finite order), we are going to regard Σ as an orbifold: it has special points Pi, i = 1, . . . , m\nwith stabilizers Zni . Then Γ is the orbifold fundamental group of Σ.1\nLet g be the genus of Σ, and al, bl, l = 1, . . . , g, be the a-cycles and b-cycles of Σ. Let cj\nbe the counterclockwise loops around Pj . Then Γ is generated by al, bl, cj with relations\nnj\nb-1\ncj = 1,\ncm =\nalblal\n-1\nl .\nc1c2 · · ·\nl\nFor each j, introduce formal parameters τkj , k = 1, . . . , nj . Define the Hecke algebra Hτ (Σ)\nof Σ to be generated over C[[τ]] by the same generators al, bl, cj with defining relations\nnj\n(cj - e 2πji/nj\nl\nl\ne τkj ) = 0,\ncm =\nalbla-1b-1 .\nc1c2 · · ·\nk=1\nl\nThus Hτ (Σ) is a deformation of C[Γ].\nThis deformation is flat if H is a Euclidean plane or a Lobachevsky plane. Indeed, Hτ (Σ) =\nHτ (Γ, H), so the result follows from Theorem 7.15 and the fact that H2(H, C) = 0.\nOn the other hand, if H is the Riemann sphere (so that the condition H2(H, C) = 0 is\nviolated) and Γ = 1 then this deformation is not flat. Indeed, let\nτ = τ(~) be a 1-parameter\nsubdeformation of Hτ (Σ) which is flat. Let us compute the determinant of the product\nc1 · · · cm in the regular representation of this algebra (which is finite dimensional if H is the\nsphere). On the one hand, it is 1, as c1 · · · cm is a product of commutators. On the other\nhand, the eigenvalues of cj in this representation are e2πji/nj eτkj with multiplicity |Γ|/nj .\nComputing determinants as products of eigenvalues, we get a nontrivial equation on τkj (~),\nwhich means that the deformation Hτ is not flat.\nThus, we see that Hτ (Σ) fails to be flat in the following \"forbidden\" cases:\ng = 0, m = 2, (n1, n2) = (n, n);\nm = 3, (n1, n2, n3) = (2, 2, n), (2, 3, 3), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5).\nIndeed, the orbifold Euler characteristic of a closed surface Σ of genus g with m special\npoints x1, . . . , xm whose orders are n1, . . . , nm is\nm\nX 1\nχorb(Σ, x1, . . . , xm) = 2 - 2g - m +\n,\nni\ni=1\nand above solutions are the solutions of the inequality\nχorb(CP 1 , x1, . . . , xm) > 0.\n(note that the solutions for m = 1 and solutions (n1, n2) with n1 = n2 don't arise, since they\ndon't correspond to any orbifolds).\n1Let X be a connected topological space on with a properly discontinuous action of a discrete group G.\nThen the orbifold fundamental group of the orbifold X/G with base point x ∈ X, denoted πorb (X/G, x),\nis the set of pairs (g, γ), where g ∈ G and γ is a homotopy class of paths leading from x to gx, with\nmultiplication law (g1, γ1)(g2, γ2) = (g1g2, γ), where γ is γ1 followed by g1(γ2). Obviously, in this situation\nwe have an exact sequence\nπ1(X, x)\nπ1\norb (X/G, x)\nG\n1.\n→\n→\n→\n→\n\nP\n7.8. Hecke algebras of wallpaper groups and del Pezzo surfaces. The case when H\nis the Euclidean plane (i.e., Γ is a wallpaper group) deserves special attention. If there are\nelliptic elements, this reduces to the following configurations: g = 0 and\nm = 3, (n1, n2, n3) = (3, 3, 3), (2, 4, 4), (2, 3, 6) (cases E6, E7, E8),\nor\nm = 4, (n1, n2, n3, n4) = (2, 2, 2, 2) (case D4).\nIn these cases, the algebra Hτ (Γ, H) (for numerical τ) has Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 2,\nso it can be interpreted in terms of the theory of noncommutative surfaces.\nRecall that a del Pezzo surface (or a Fano surface) is a smooth projective surface, whose\nanticanonical line bundle is ample. It is known that such surfaces are CP1 × CP1, or a blow\nup of CP2 at up to 8 generic points. The degree of a del Pezzo surface X is by definition the\nself intersection number K K of its canonical class K. For example, a del Pezzo surface of\n·\ndegree 3 is a cubic surface in CP3, and the degree of CP2 with n generic points blown up is\nd = 9 - n.\nn-1\nNow suppose τ is numerical. Let ~ =\nj,k\nj τkj . Also let n be the largest of nj , and c\nbe the corresponding cj . Let e ∈ C[c] ⊂ Hτ (Γ, H) be the projector to an eigenspace of c.\nConsider the \"spherical\" subalgebra Bτ (Γ, H) := eHτ (Γ, H)e.\nTheorem 7.19 (Etingof, Oblomkov, Rains, [EOR]).\n(i) If ~ = 0 then the algebra Bτ (Γ, H)\nis commutative, and its spectrum is an affine del Pezzo surface. More precisely, in\nthe case (2, 2, 2, 2), it is a del Pezzo surface of degree 3 (a cubic surface) with a tri\nangle of lines removed; in the cases (3, 3, 3), (2, 4, 4), (2, 3, 6) it is a del Pezzo surface\nof degrees 3,2,1 respectively with a nodal rational curve removed.\n(ii) The algebra Bτ (Γ, H) for ~ =6\n0 is a quantization of the unique algebraic symplectic\nstructure on the surface from (i) with Planck's constant ~.\nProof. See [EOR].\n\nRemark 7.20. In the case (2, 2, 2, 2), Hτ (Γ, Γ) is the Cherednik-Sahi algebra of rank 1; it\ncontrols the theory of Askey-Wilson polynomials.\nExample 7.21. This is a \"multivariate\" version of the Hecke algebras attached to Fuchsian\ngroups, defined in the previous subsection. Namely, letting Γ, H be as in the previous\nsubsection, and N ≥ 1, we consider the manifold X = HN with the action of ΓN = SN nΓN .\nIf H is a Euclidean or Lobachevsky plane, then by Theorem 7.15 Hτ (ΓN , XN ) is a flat\ndeformation of the group algebra C[ΓN ]. If N > 1, this algebra has one more essential\nparameter than for N = 1 (corresponding to reflections in SN ). In the Euclidean case, one\nexpects that an appropriate \"spherical\" subalgebra of this algebra is a quantization of the\nHilbert scheme of a del Pezzo surface.\n7.9. The Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov functor. In this subsection we will define a global\nanalog of the KZ functor defined in [GGOR]. This functor will be used as a tool of proof of\nTheorem 7.15.\nLet X be a simply connected complex manifold, and G a discrete group of holomorphic\ntransformations of X acting on X properly discontinuously. Let X0 ⊂ X be the set of points\nwith trivial stabilizer. Then we can define the sheaf of Cherednik algebras H1,c,η,0,G,X on\nX/G. Note that the restriction of this sheaf to X0/G is the same as the restriction of the\n\nsheaf G n DX to X0/G (i.e. on X0/G, the dependence of the sheaf on the parameters c and\nη disappears). This follows from the fact that the line bundles OX (Y ) become trivial when\nrestricted to X0.\nNow let M be a module over H1,c,η,0,G,X which is a locally free coherent sheaf when\nrestricted to X0/G. Then the restriction of M to X0/G is a G-equivariant D-module on\nX0 which is coherent and locally free as an O-module. Thus, M corresponds to a locally\nconstant sheaf (local system) on X0/G, which gives rise to a monodromy representation of\nthe braid group π1(X0/G, x0) (where x0 is a base point). This representation will be denoted\nby KZ(M). This defines a functor KZ, which is analogous to the one in [GGOR].\nIt follows from the theory of D-modules that any OX/G-coherent H1,c,η,0,G,X -module is\nlocally free when restricted to X0/G. Thus the KZ functor acts from the abelian category\nCc,η of OX/G-coherent H1,c,η,0,G,X -modules to the category of representations of π1(X0/G, x0).\nIt is easy to see that this functor is exact.\nFor any Y , let gY be the generator of GY which has eigenvalue e2πi/nY in the conormal\nbundle to Y . Let (c, η)\nτ(c, η) be the invertible linear transformation defined by the\n→\nformula\nnX\nY -1\n1 - e2πjmi/nY\nτjY = 2πi(2\nc(Y, gY\nm)1 - e-2πmi/nY - η(Y ))/nY .\nm=1\nProposition 7.22. The functor KZ maps the category Cc,η to the category of representations\nof the algebra Hτ (c,η)(G, X).\nProof. The result follows from the corresponding result in the linear case (which we have\nalready proved) by restricting M to the union of G-translates of a neighborhood of a generic\npoint y ∈ Y , and then linearizing the action of GY on this neighborhood.\n\n7.10. Proof of Theorem 7.15. Consider the module M = IndGnDX OX . Then KZ(M)\nDX\nis the regular representation of G which is denoted by regG. We want to show that M\ndeforms uniquely (up to an isomorphism) to a module over H1,c,0,η,G,X for formal c, η. The\nobstruction to this deformation is in Ext2\n(M, M) and the freedom of this deformation\nGnDX\nis in Ext1\n(M, M). Since\nGnDX\nExti\n(M, M) = Exti (OX , ResM) = Exti\nGnDX\nDX\nDX (OX , OX ⊗ CG)\n= Exti (OX , OX ) ⊗ CG = Hi(X, C) ⊗ CG,\nDX\nand X is simply connected, we have\nExt1\n(M, M) = 0, and Ext2\n(M, M) = 0 if H2(X, C) = 0.\nGnDX\nGnDX\nThus such deformation exists and is unique if H2(X, C) = 0.\nNow let Mc,η be the deformation. Then KZ(Mc,η) is a Hτ (c,η)(G, X)-module from Propo\nsition 7.22 and it deforms flatly the module regG. This implies Hτ (c,η)(G, X) is flat over\nC[[τ ]].\nRemark 7.23. When X is not simply connected, the theorem is still true under the as\nsumption π2(X) ⊗ C = 0 (i.e. H2(X,\ne C) = 0, where Xe is the universal cover of X), and the\nproof is contained in [E1].\n\n7.11. Example: the simplest case of double affine Hecke algebras. Now let G =\nZ2 n Z2 acting on C. Then the conjugacy classes of reflection hyperplanes are four points:\n0, 1/2, 1/2 + η/2, η/2, where we suppose the lattice in C is Z ⊕ Zη. Correspondingly, the\npresentation of G is as follows:\ngenerators: T1, T2, T3, T4;\nrelations: T1T2T3T4 = 1, Ti\n2 = 1.\nThus, the corresponding orbifold Hecke algebra is the following deformation of CG:\ngenerators: T1, T2, T3, T4;\nrelations: T1T2T3T4 = 1, (Ti - pi)(Ti - qi) = 0,\nwhere pi, qi (i = 1, . . . , 4), are parameters.\nIf we renormalize the Ti, these relations turn into\n(Ti - ti)(Ti + t-\ni\n1) = 0,\nT1T2T3T4 = q,\nand we get the type C∨C1 double affine Hecke algebra. If we set three of the four Ti's\nsatisfying the undeformed relation Ti\n2 = 1, we get the double affine Hecke algebra of type\nA1. More precisely, this algebra is generated by T1, . . . , T4 with relations\nT2\n2 = T3\n2 = T4\n2 = 1,\n(T1 - t)(T1 + t-1) = 0,\nT1T2T3T4 = q.\nAnother presentation of this algebra (which is more widely used) is as follows. Let E =\nC/Z2, an elliptic curve with an Z2 action defined by z 7→ -z. Define the partial braid group\nB = πorb(E\\{0}/Z2, x),\nwhere x is a generic point. Notice that comparing to the usual braid group, we do not\ndelete three of the four reflection points. The generators of the group π1(E \\ {0}, x) (the\nfundamental group of a punctured 2-torus) are X (corresponding to the a-cycle on the torus),\nY (corresponding to the b-cycle on the torus) and C (corresponding to the loop around 0). In\norder to construct B, which is an extension of Z2 by π1(E \\ {0}, x), we introduce an element\nT s.t. T 2 = C (the half-loop around the puncture). Then X, Y, T satisfy the following\nrelations:\nTXT = X-1 ,\nT -1Y T -1 = Y -1 ,\nY -1X-1Y XT 2 = 1.\nThe Hecke algebra of the partial braid group is then defined to be the group algebra of B\nplus an extra relation: (T - q1)(T + q2) = 0.\nA common way to present this Hecke algebra is to renormalize the generators so that one\nhas the following relations:\nTXT = X-1, T -1Y T -1 = Y -1, Y -1X-1Y XT 2 = q, (T - t)(T + t-1) = 0.\nThis is Cherednik's definition for H (q, t), the double affine Hecke algebra of type A1 which\ndepends on two parameters q, t.\nThere are two degenerations of the algebra H (q, t).\n1. The trigonometric degeneration.\nSet Y = e~y, q = e~ , t = e~c and T = se~cs, where s ∈ Z2 is the reflection. Then s, X, y\nsatisfy the following relations modulo ~:\ns 2 = 1,\nsXs-1 = X-1 ,\nsy + ys = 2c,\nX-1yX - y = 1 - 2cs.\nThe algebra generated by s, X, y with these relations is called the type A1 trigonomet\nric Cherednik algebra. It is easy to show that it is isomorphic to the Cherednik algebra\nH1,c(Z2, C∗), where Z2 acts on C∗ by z\nz-1 .\n→\n\nL\nL\n2. The rational degeneration.\nIn the trigonometric Cherednik algebra, set X = e~x and y = ˆ\nThen s, x, ˆ\ny/~.\ny satisfy the\nfollowing relations modulo ~:\ns 2 = 1, sx = -xs, sˆ\nys, ˆ\ny = 1 - 2cs.\ny = -ˆ\nyx - xˆ\nThe algebra generated by s, x, yˆ with these relations is the rational Cherednik algebra\nH1,c(Z2, C) with the action of Z2 on C is given by z →-z.\n7.12. Affine and extended affine Weyl groups. Let R =\nbe a root system\n{α} ⊂ Rn\nwith respect to a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form (·, ) on Rn . We will assume that\n·\nR is reduced. Let {αi}n\ni=1 ⊂ R be the set of simple roots and R+ (respectively R-) be the\nset of positive (respectively negative) roots. The coroots are denoted by α∨ = 2α/(α, α).\nLet Q∨ =\nn\ni=1 Zα∨\ni be the coroot lattice and P ∨ =\nn\ni=1 Zωi\n∨the coweight lattice, where\nωi\n∨'s are the fundamental coweights, i.e., (ωi\n∨, αj ) = δij . Let θ be the maximal positive root,\nand assume that the bilinear form is normalized by the condition (θ, θ) = 2. Let W be the\nWeyl group which is generated by the reflections sα (α ∈ R).\nBy definition, the affine root system is\nRa = {α = [α, j] ∈ Rn × R| where α ∈ R, j ∈ Z}.\nThe set of positive affine roots is Ra = {[α, j]\nDefine α0 =\n+\n| j ∈ Z>0} ∪{[α, 0] | α ∈ R+}.\n[-θ, 1]. We will identify α ∈ R with α = [α, 0] ∈ Ra .\nFor an arbitrary affine root α = [α, j] and a vector z = [z, ζ] ∈ Rn × R, the corresponding\naffine reflection is defined as follows:\nsα ( z) = z - 2 (z, α) α = z - (z, α∨) α.\n(α, α)\nThe affine Weyl group W a is generated by the affine reflections {sα | α ∈ Re+}, and we have\nan isomorphism:\n= W n Q∨,\nW a ∼\nwhere the translation α∨ ∈ Q∨ is naturally identified with the composition s[-α,1]sα ∈ W a.\next\nDefine the extended affine Weyl group to be W a = W n P ∨ acting on Rn+1 via b( z) =\next\n[z, ζ -(b, z)] for z = [z, ζ], b ∈ P ∨. Then W a ⊂ W\n. Moreover, W a is a normal subgroup of\na\next\next\nW\nand W\n/W a = P ∨/Q∨. The latter group can be identified with the group Π = {πr} of\na\na\nthe elements of W\next\na permuting simple affine roots under their action in Rn+1 . It is a normal\ncommutative subgroup of Aut = Aut(Dyna) (Dyna denotes the affine Dynkin diagram).\nThe quotient Aut/Π is isomorphic to the group of the automorphisms preserving α0, i.e. the\ngroup AutDyn of automorphisms of the finite Dynkin diagram.\n7.13. Cherednik's double affine Hecke algebra of a root system. In this subsection,\nwe will give an explicit presentation of Cherednik's DAHA for a root system, defined in\nExample 7.18. This is done by giving an explicit presentation of the corresponding braid\ngroup (which is called the elliptic braid group), and then imposing quadratic relations on the\ngenerators corresponding to reflections.\nFor a root system R, let m = 2 if R is of type D2k, m = 1 if R is of type B2k, Ck, and\notherwise m = Π . Let mij be the number of edges between vertex i and vertex j in the\n| |\n\nY\nX\nY\naffine Dynkin diagram of Ra . Let Xi (i = 1, . . . , n) be a family of pairwise commutative and\nalgebraically independent elements. Set\nn\nn\nX[b,j] =\nXi\n`i qj, where b =\n`iωi ∈ P, j ∈ Z/mZ.\ni=1\ni=1\next\nFor an element wˆ ∈ W\n, we can define an action on these X[b,j] by ˆwX[b,j] = Xwˆ[b,j].\na\nDefinition 7.24 (Cherednik). The double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) of the root system\nR, denoted by H , is an algebra defined over the field Cq,t = C(q1/m, t1/2), generated by\nTi, i = 0, . . . , n, Π, Xb, b ∈ P , subject to the following relations:\n(1) TiTj Ti · · · = Tj TiTj · · · , mij factors each side;\n(2) (Ti - ti)(Ti + t-1) = 0 for i = 0, . . . , n;\ni\n(3) πTiπ-1 = Tπ(i), for π ∈ Π and i = 0, . . . , n;\n(4) πXbπ-1 = Xπ(b), for π ∈ Π, b ∈ P ;\n(5) TiXbTi = XbXα\n-\ni\n1 , if i > 0 and (b, α∨\ni ) = 1; TiXb = XbTi, if i > 0 and (b, αi\n∨) = 0;\n(6) T0XbT0 = Xb-α0 if (b, θ) = -1; T0Xb = XbT0 if (b, θ) = 0.\nHere ti are parameters attached to simple affine roots (so that roots of the same length\ngive rise to the same parameters).\nThe degenerate double affine Hecke algebra (trigonometric Cherednik algebra) HH trig is\next\nP n\ngenerated by the group algebra of W a , Π and pairwise commutative y b =\ni=1(b, α∨)yi + u\nfor b = [b, u] ∈ P × Z, with the following relations:\nsiyb - ysi(b)si = -ki(b, αi\n∨), for i = 1, . . . , n,\ns0yb - ys0(b)s0 = k0(b, θ),\nπrybπr\n-1 = yπr (b) for πr ∈ Π.\nRemark 7.25. This degeneration can be obtained from the DAHA similarly to the case of\nA1, which is described above.\n7.14. Algebraic flatness of Hecke algebras of polygonal Fuchsian groups. Let W\nbe the Coxeter group of rank r corresponding to a Coxeter datum:\nmij (i, j = 1, . . . , r, i =6\nj), such that 2 ≤ mij ≤inf and mij = mji.\nSo the group W has generators si i = 1, . . . , r, and defining relations\ns 2\ni = 1, (sisj )mij = 1 if mij =6\ninf.\nIt has a sign character ξ : W → {±1} given by ξ(si) = -1. Denote by W+ the kernel of ξ\n(the even subgroup of W ). It is generated by aij = sisj with relations:\n= a-1\nmij\naij\nji ,\naij ajkaki = 1,\naij\n= 1.\nWe can deform the group algebra C[W ] as follows. Define the algebra A(W ) with invertible\ngenerators si, and tij,k, i, j = 1, . . . , r, k ∈ Zmij for (i, j) such that mij < inf and defining\nrelations\ntij,k = t-1\nsi\n2 = 1,\n[tij,k, ti0j0,k0 ] = 0,\nsptij,k = tji,ksp,\nji,-k,\nmij\n(sisj - tij,k) = 0 if mij < inf.\nk=1\nNotice that if we set tij,k = exp(2πki/mij ), we get C[W ].\n\nY\nY\nY\nDefine also the algebra A+(W ) over R := C[tij,k] (tij,k = t-1 ) by generators aij , i = j\nji,-k\n(aij = a-1), and relations\nji\nmij\n(aij - tij,k) = 0 if mij < inf,\naij ajpapi = 1.\nk=1\nIf w is a word in letters si, let Tw be the corresponding element of A(W ). Choose a\nfunction w(x) which attaches to every element x ∈ W , a reduced word w(x) representing x\nin W .\nTheorem 7.26 (Etingof, Rains, [ER]).\n(i) The elements Tw(x), x ∈ W , form a spanning\nset in A(W ) as a left R-module.\n(ii) The elements Tw(x), x ∈ W+, form a spanning set in A+(W ) as a left R-module.\n(iii) The elements Tw(x), x ∈ W , are linearly independent if W has no finite parabolic\nsubgroups of rank 3.\nProof. We only give the proof of (i). Statement (ii) follows from (i). Proof of (iii), which is\nquite nontrivial, can be found in [ER] (it uses the geometry of constructible sheaves on the\nCoxeter complex of W ).\nLet us write the relation\nmij\n(sisj - tij,k) = 0\nk=1\nas a deformed braid relation:\nsj sisj . . . + S.L.T. = tij sisj si . . . + S.L.T.,\nwhere tij = (-1)mij +1tij,1 · · · tij,mij , S.L.T. mean \"smaller length terms\", and the products\non both sides have length mij . This can be done by multiplying the relation by sisj · · · (mij\nfactors).\nNow let us show that Tw(x) span A(W ) over R. Clearly, Tw for all words w span A(W ).\nSo we just need to take any word w and express Tw via Tw(x).\nIt is well known from the theory of Coxeter groups (see e.g. [B]) that using the braid\nrelations, one can turn any non-reduced word into a word that is not square free, and any\nreduced expression of a given element of W into any other reduced expression of the same\nelement. Thus, if w is non-reduced, then by using the deformed braid relations we can reduce\nTw to a linear combination of Tu with words u of smaller length than w. On the other hand,\nif w is a reduced expression for some element x ∈ W , then using the deformed braid relations\nwe can reduce Tw to a linear combination of Tu with u shorter than w, and Tw(x). Thus Tw(x)\nare a spanning set. This proves (i).\n\nThus, A+(W ) is a \"deformation\" of C[W+] over R, and similarly A(W ) is a \"twisted\ndeformation\" of C[W ].\nNow let Γ = Γ(m1, . . . , mr), r ≥ 3, be the Fuchsian group defined by generators cj ,\nj = 1, . . . , r, with defining relations\nr\nmj\ncj\n= 1,\ncj = 1.\nj=1\nHere 2 ≤ mj < inf.\n\nY\nY\nP\nSuppose Γ acts on H where H is a simply connected complex Riemann surface as in\nSection 7.7. We have the Hecke algebra of Γ, Hτ (H, Γ), defined by the same (invertible)\ngenerators cj and relations\nr\n(cj - exp(2πik/nj )qjk) = 0,\ncj = 1,\nk\nj=1\nwhere qjk = exp(τjk).\nWe saw above (Theorem 7.15) that if τjk's are formal, the algebra Hτ (Γ, H) is flat in τ if\n|Γ| is infinite (i.e., H is Euclidean or hyperbolic). Here is a much stronger non-formal version\nof this theorem.\nTheorem 7.27. The algebra Hτ (Γ, H) is free as a left module over R := C[q±1] if and only\nP\njk\nif\n(1 - 1/mj ) ≥ 2 (i.e., H is Euclidean or hyperbolic).\nj\nProof. Let us consider the Coxeter datum: mij , i, j = 1, . . . , r, such that mi,i+1 := mi\n(i ∈ Z/rZ), and mij = inf otherwise. Suppose the corresponding Coxeter group is W . Then\nwe can see that Γ = W+. Notice that the algebra Hτ (Γ, H) for genus 0 orbifolds is the\nalgebra A+(W ), i.e., we have Hτ (Γ, H) = A+(W ).\nThe condition\n(1 - 1/mj ) ≥ 2 is equivalent to the condition that W has no finite\nj\nparabolic subgroups of rank 3. From Theorem 7.26 (ii) and Theorem 7.15, we can see that\nA+(W ) is free as a left module over R. We are done.\n\n7.15. Notes. Section 7.8 follows Section 6 of the paper [EOR]; Cherednik's definition of the\ndouble affine Hecke algebra of a root system is from Cherednik's book [Ch]; Sections 7.7 and\n7.14 follow the paper [ER]; The other parts of this section follow the paper [E1].\n\nX\nX\n8. Symplectic reflection algebras\n8.1. The definition of symplectic reflection algebras. Rational Cherednik algebras for\nfinite Coxeter groups are a special case of a wider class of algebras called symplectic reflection\nalgebras. To define them, let V be a finite dimensional symplectic vector space over C with\na symplectic form ω, and G be a finite group acting symplectically (linearly) on V . For\nsimplicity let us assume that (∧2V ∗)G = Cω (i.e., V is symplectically irreducible) and that\nG acts faithfully on V (these assumptions are not important, and essentially not restrictive).\nDefinition 8.1. A symplectic reflection in G is an element g such that the rank of the\noperator 1 - g on V is 2.\nIf s is a symplectic reflection, then let ωs(x, y) be the form ω applied to the projections of\nx, y to the image of 1 - s along the kernel of 1 - s; thus ωs is a skewsymmetric form of rank\n2 on V .\nLet S ⊂ G be the set of symplectic reflections, and c : S → C be a function which is\ninvariant under the action of G. Let t ∈ C.\nDefinition 8.2. The symplectic reflection algebra Ht,c = Ht,c[G, V ] is the quotient of the\nalgebra C[G] n T(V ) by the ideal generated by the relation\n(8.1)\n[x, y] = tω(x, y) - 2\ncsωs(x, y)s.\ns∈S\nExample 8.3. Let W be a finite Coxeter group with reflection representation h. We can set\nV = h ⊕ h∗, ω(x, x0) = ω(y, y0) = 0, ω(y, x) = (y, x), for x, x0 ∈ h∗ and y, y0 ∈ h. In this case\n(1) symplectic reflections are the usual reflections in W ;\n(2) ωs(x, x0) = ωs(y, y0) = 0, ωs(y, x) = (y, αs)(α∨\ns , x)/2.\nThus, Ht,c[G, h ⊕ h∗] coincides with the rational Cherednik algebra Ht,c(G, h) defined in\nSection 3.\nExample 8.4. Let Γ be a finite subgroup of SL2(C), and V = C2 be the tautological\nrepresentation, with its standard symplectic form. Then all nontrivial elements of Γ are\nsymplectic reflections, and for any symplectic reflection s, ωs = ω. So the main commutation\nrelation of Ht,c[Γ, V ] takes the form\n[y, x] = t -\n2cgg.\ng∈Γ,g=1\nExample 8.5. (Wreath products) Let Γ be as in the previous example, G = Sn n Γn, and\nV = (C2)n . Then symplectic reflections are conjugates (g, 1, ..., 1), g ∈ Γ, g =6\n1, and also\nconmjugates of transpositions in Sn (so there is one more conjugacy class of reflections than\nin the previous example).\nNote also that for any V, G, H0,0[G, V ] = G n SV , and H1,0[G, V ] = G n Weyl(V ), where\nWeyl(V ) is the Weyl algebra of V , i.e. the quotient of the tensor algebra T(V ) by the\nrelation xy - yx = ω(x, y), x, y ∈ V .\n8.2. The PBW theorem for symplectic reflection algebras. To ensure that the sym\nplectic reflection algebras Ht,c have good properties, we need to prove a PBW theorem for\nthem, which is an analog of Proposition 3.5. This is done in the following theorem, which\nalso explains the special role played by symplectic reflections.\n\nX\nTheorem 8.6. Let κ : ∧2V → C[G] be a linear G-equivariant function. Define the algebra\nHκ to be the quotient of the algebra C[G]nT(V ) by the relation [x, y] = κ(x, y), x, y ∈ V . Put\nan increasing filtration on Hκ by setting deg(V ) = 1, deg(G) = 0, and define ξ : CG n SV →\ngrHκ to be the natural surjective homomorphism. Then ξ is an isomorphism if and only if κ\nhas the form\nκ(x, y) = tω(x, y) - 2\ncsωs(x, y)s,\ns∈S\nfor some t ∈ C and G-invariant function c : S → C.\nUnfortunately, for a general symplectic reflection algebra we don't have a Dunkl operator\nrepresentation, so the proof of the more difficult \"if\" part of this Theorem is not as easy\nas the proof of Proposition 3.5. Instead of explicit computations with Dunkl operators, it\nmakes use of the deformation theory of Koszul algebras, which we will now discuss.\n8.3. Koszul algebras. Let R be a finite dimensional semisimple algebra (over C). Let A\nbe a Z+-graded algebra, such that A[0] = R, and assume that the graded components of A\nare finite dimensional.\nDefinition 8.7.\n(i) The algebra A is said to be quadratic if it is generated over R by\nA[1], and has defining relations in degree 2.\n(ii) A is Koszul if all elements of Exti(R, R) (where R is the augmentation module over\nA) have grade degree precisely i.\nRemark 8.8.\n(1) Thus, in a quadratic algebra, A[2] = A[1] ⊗R A[1]/E, where E is the\nsubspace (R-subbimodule) of relations.\n(2) It is easy to show that a Koszul algebra is quadratic, since the condition to be\nquadratic is just the Koszulity condition for i = 1, 2.\nNow let A0 be a quadratic algebra, A0[0] = R. Let E0 be the space of relations for A0. Let\nE ⊂ A0[1] ⊗R A0[1][[~]] be a free (over C[[~]]) R-subbimodule which reduces to E0 modulo ~\n(\"deformation of the relations\"). Let A be the (~-adically complete) algebra generated over\nR[[~]] by A[1] = A0[1][[~]] with the space of defining relations E. Thus A is a Z+-graded\nalgebra.\nThe following very important theorem is due to Beilinson, Ginzburg, and Soergel, [BGS]\n(less general versions appeared earlier in the works of Drinfeld [Dr], Polishchuk-Positselski\n[PP], Braverman-Gaitsgory [BG]). We will not give its proof.\nTheorem 8.9 (Koszul deformation principle). If A0 is Koszul then A is a topologically free\nC[[~]] module if and only if so is A[3].\nRemark. Note that A[i] for i < 3 are obviously topologically free.\nWe will now apply this theorem to the proof of Theorem 8.6.\n8.4. Proof of Theorem 8.6. Let κ : ∧2V\nC[G] be a linear G-equivariant map. We write\nκ(x, y) = P\ng∈G κg(x, y)g, where κg(x, y) ∈ ∧\n→\n2V ∗. To apply Theorem 8.9, let us homogenize\nour algebras. Namely, let A0 = (CG n SV ) ⊗ C[u] (where u has degree 1). Also let ~ be a\nformal parameter, and consider the deformation A = H~u2κ of A0. That is, A is the quotient\nof G n T(V )[u][[~]] by the relations [x, y] = ~u2κ(x, y). This is a deformation of the type\nconsidered in Theorem 8.9, and it is easy to see that its flatness in ~ is equivalent to Theorem\n\nP\n8.6. Also, the algebra A0 is Koszul, because the polynomial algebra SV is a Koszul algebra.\nThus by Theorem 8.9, it suffices to show that A is flat in degree 3.\nThe flatness condition in degree 3 is \"the Jacobi identity\"\n[κ(x, y), z] + [κ(y, z), x] + [κ(z, x), y] = 0,\nwhich must be satisfied in CG n V . In components, this equation transforms into the system\nof equations\nκg(x, y)(z - zg) + κg(y, z)(x - xg) + κg(z, x)(y - yg) = 0\nfor every g ∈ G (here zg denotes the result of the action of g on z).\nThis equation, in particular, implies that if x, y, g are such that κg(x, y) = 0 then for any\ng\ng\ng\nz ∈ V z - z is a linear combination of x - x and y - y . Thus κg(x, y) is identically zero\nunless the rank of (1 - g)|V is at most 2, i.e. g = 1 or g is a symplectic reflection.\nIf g = 1 then κg(x, y) has to be G-invariant, so it must be of the form tω(x, y), where\nt ∈ C.\nIf g is a symplectic reflection, then κg(x, y) must be zero for any x such that x - xg = 0.\nIndeed, if for such an x there had existed y with κg(x, y) 6= 0 then z - zg for any z would\nbe a multiple of y - yg, which is impossible since Im(1 - g)|V is 2-dimensional. This implies\nthat κg(x, y) = 2cgωg(x, y), and cg must be invariant.\nThus we have shown that if A is flat (in degree 3) then κ must have the form given in\nTheorem 8.6. Conversely, it is easy to see that if κ does have such form, then the Jacobi\nidentity holds. So Theorem 8.6 is proved.\n8.5. The spherical subalgebra of the symplectic reflection algebra. The properties of\nsymplectic reflection algebras are similar to the properties of rational Cherednik algebras we\nhave studied before. The main difference is that we no longer have the Dunkl representation\nand localization results, so some proofs are based on different ideas and are more complicated.\nThe spherical subalgebra of the symplectic reflection algebra is defined in the same way\nas in the Cherednik algebra case. Namely, let e = |G|-1\ng∈G g, and Bt,c = eHt,ce.\nProposition 8.10. Bt,c is commutative if and only if t = 0.\nProof. Let A be a Z+-filtered algebra. If A is not commutative, then we can define a nonzero\nPoisson bracket on grA in the following way. Let m be the minimum of deg(a) + deg(b) -\ndeg([a, b]) (over a, b ∈ A such that [a, b] = 0). Then for homogeneous elements\na0, b0 ∈ A0 of\ndegrees p, q, we can define {a0, b0} to be the image in A0[p + q - m] of [a, b], where a, b are\nany lifts of a0, b0 to A. It is easy to check that {· , ·} is a Poisson bracket on A0 of degree\n-m.\nLet us now apply this construction to the filtered algebra A = Bt,c. We have gr(A) =\nA0 = (SV )G .\nLemma 8.11. A0 has a unique, up to scaling, Poisson bracket of degree -2, and no nonzero\nPoisson brackets of degrees < -2.\nProof. A Poisson bracket on (SV )G is the same thing as a Poisson bracket on the variety\nV ∗/G. On the smooth part (V ∗/G)s of V ∗/G, it is simply a bivector field, and we can lift\nit to a bivector field on the preimage Vs\n∗ of (V ∗/G)s in V ∗, which is the set of points in V\nwith trivial stabilizers. But the codimension on V ∗ \\ Vs\n∗ in V ∗ is 2 (as V ∗ \\ Vs\n∗ is a union\nof symplectic subspaces), so the bivector on Vs\n∗ extends to a regular bivector on V ∗. So if\n\nthis bivector is homogeneous, it must have degree ≥-2, and if it has degree -2 then it\nmust be with constant coefficients, so being G-invariant, it is a multiple of ω. The lemma is\nproved.\n\nNow, for each t, c we have a natural Poisson bracket on A0 of degree -2, which depends\nlinearly on t, c. So by the lemma, this bracket has to be of the form f(t, c)Π, where Π is the\nunique up to scaling Poisson bracket of degree -2, and f a homogeneous linear function.\nThus the algebra A = Bt,c is not commutative unless f(t, c) = 0. On the other hand, if\nf(t, c) = 0, and Bt,c is not commutative, then, as we've shown, A0 has a nonzero Poisson\nbracket of degree < -2. But By Lemma 8.11, there is no such brackets. So Bt,c must be\ncommutative if f(t, c) = 0.\nIt remains to show that f(t, c) is in fact a nonzero multiple of t. First note that f(1, 0) = 0,\nsince B1,0 is definitely noncommutative. Next, let us take a point (t, c) such that Bt,c is\ncommutative. Look at the Ht,c-module Ht,ce, which has a commuting action of Bt,c from the\nright. Its associated graded is SV as an (CG n SV, (SV )G)-bimodule, which implies that\nthe generic fiber of Ht,ce as a Bt,c-module is the regular representation of G. So we have a\nfamily of finite dimensional representations of Ht,c on the fibers of Ht,ce, all realized in the\nregular representation of G. Computing the trace of the main commutation relation (8.1) of\nHt,c in this representation, we obtain that t = 0 (since Tr (s) = 0 for any reflection s). The\nproposition is proved.\n\nNote that B0,c has no zero divisors, since its associated graded algebra (SV )G does not.\nThus, like in the Cherednik algebra case, we can define a Poisson variety Mc, the spectrum\nof B0,c, called the Calogero-Moser space of G, V . Moreover, the algebra Bc := B~,c over C[~]\nis an algebraic quantization of Mc.\n8.6. The center of the symplectic reflection algebra Ht,c. Consider the bimodule Ht,ce,\nwhich has a left action of Ht,c and a right commuting action of Bt,c. It is obvious that\nEndHt,c Ht,ce = Bt,c (with opposite product). The following theorem shows that the bimodule\nHt,ce has the double centralizer property (i.e., EndBt,c Ht,ce = Ht,c).\nNote that we have a natural map ξt,c : Ht,c → EndBt,c Ht,ce.\nTheorem 8.12. ξt,c is an isomorphism for any t, c.\nProof. The complete proof is given [EG]. We will give the main ideas of the proof skipping\nstraightforward technical details. The first step is to show that the result is true in the\ngraded case, (t, c) = (0, 0). To do so, note the following easy lemma:\nLemma 8.13. If X is an affine complex algebraic variety with algebra of functions OX and\nG a finite group acting freely on X then the natural map ξX : G n OX → EndOX OX is an\nG\nisomorphism.\nTherefore, the map ξ0,0 : G n SV\nEnd(SV )G (SV ) is injective, and moreover becomes an\n→\nisomorphism after localization to the field of quotients C(V ∗)G . To show it's surjective, take\na ∈ End(SV )G (SV ). There exists a0 ∈ G n C(V ∗) which maps to a. Moreover, by Lemma\n8.13, a0 can have poles only at fixed points of G on V ∗. But these fixed points form a subset\nof codimension ≥ 2, so there can be no poles and we are done in the case (t, c) = (0, 0).\nNow note that the algebra EndBt,c Ht,ce has an increasing integer filtration (bounded be\nlow) induced by the filtration on Ht,c. This is due to the fact that Ht,ce is a finitely generated\n\neHt,ce-module (since it is true in the associated graded situation, by Hilbert's theorem about\ninvariants). Also, the natural map grEndBt,c Ht,ce\nEndgrBt,c grHt,ce is clearly injective.\n→\nTherefore, our result in the case (t, c) = (0, 0) implies that this map is actually an iso\nmorphism (as so is its composition with the associated graded of ξt,c). Identifying the two\nalgebras by this isomorphism, we find that gr(ξt,c) = ξ0,0. Since ξ0,0 is an isomorphism, ξt,c\nis an isomorphism for all t, c, as desired. 2\n\nDenote by Zt,c the center of the symplectic reflection algebra Ht,c. We have the following\ntheorem.\nTheorem 8.14. If t = 0, the center of Ht,c is trivial. If t = 0, we have grZ0,c = Z0,0. In\nparticular, H0,c is finitely generated over its center.\nProof. The t = 0 case was proved by Brown and Gordon [BGo] as follows. If t = 0, we have\ngrZt,c ⊆ Z0,0 = (SV )G . Also, we have a map\nτt,c : Zt,c → Bt,c = eHt,ce,\nz 7→ ze = eze.\nThe map τt,c is injective since gr(τt,c) is injective. In particular, the image of gr(τt,c) is\ncontained in Z(Bt,c), the center of Bt,c. Thus it is enough to show that Z(Bt,c) is trivial. To\nshow this, note that grZ(Bt,c) is contained in the Poisson center of B0,0 which is trivial. So\nZ(Bt,c) is trivial.\nNow suppose t = 0. We need to show that gr(τ0,c) : gr(Z0,c)\nZ0,0 is an isomorphism. It\n→\nsuffices to show that τ0,c is an isomorphism. To show this, we construct τ0\n-\n,c\n1 : B0,c → Z0,c as\nfollows.\nFor any b ∈ B0,c, since B0,c is commutative, we have an element b ∈ EndB0,c (H0,ce) which\nis defined as the right multiplication by b. From Theorem 8.12, b ∈ H0,c. Moreover, b ∈ Z0,c\nsince it commutes with H0,c as a linear operator on the faithful H0,c-module H0,ce. So b ∈ Z0,c.\nIt is easy to see that be = b. So we can set b = τ0\n-\n,c\n1(b) which defines the inverse map to\nτ0,c.\n\n8.7. A review of deformation theory. Now we would like to explain that symplectic\nreflection algebras are the most general deformations of algebras of the from G n Weyl(V ).\nBefore we do so, we give a brief review of classical deformation theory of associative algebras.\n8.7.1. Formal deformations of associative algebras. Let A0 be an associative algebra with\nunit over C. Denote by μ0 the multiplication in A0.\nDefinition 8.15. A (flat) formal n-parameter deformation of A0 is an algebra A over\nC[[~]] = C[[~1, . . . , ~n]] which is topologically free as a C[[~]]-module, together with an\nalgebra isomorphism η0 : A/mA → A0 where m = h~1, . . . , ~ni is the maximal ideal in C[[~]].\nWhen no confusion is possible, we will call A a deformation of A0 (omitting \"formal\").\nLet us restrict ourselves to one-parameter deformations with parameter ~. Let us choose\nan identification η : A\nA0[[~]] as C[[~]]-modules, such that η = η0 modulo ~. Then the\n→\n2Here we use the fact that the filtration is bounded from below. In the case of an unbounded filtration,\nit is possible for a map not to be an isomorphism if its associated graded is an isomorphism. An example of\nthis is the operator of multiplication by 1 + t-1 in the space of Laurent polynomials in t, filtered by degree.\n\nproduct in A is completely determined by the product of elements of A0, which has the form\nof a \"star-product\"\nμ(a, b) = a ∗ b = μ0(a, b) + ~μ1(a, b) + ~2 μ2(a, b) + · · · ,\nwhere μi : A0 ⊗ A0 → A0 are linear maps, and μ0(a, b) = ab.\n8.7.2. Hochschild cohomology. The main tool in deformation theory of associative algebras\nis Hochschild cohomology. Let us recall its definition.\nLet A be an associative algebra. Let M be a bimodule over A. A Hochschild n-cochain of\nA with coefficients in M is a linear map A⊗n\nM. The space of such cochains is denoted\nby Cn(A, M). The differential d : Cn(A, M) →\n→\nCn+1(A, M) is defined by the formula\ndf(a1, . . . , an+1)\n= f(a1, . . . , an)an+1 - f(a1, . . . , anan+1) + f(a1, . . . , an-1an, an+1)\n-· · · + (-1)nf(a1a2, . . . , an+1) + (-1)n+1 a1f(a2, . . . , an+1).\nIt is easy to show that d2 = 0.\nDefinition 8.16. The Hochschild cohomology HH-(A, M) is defined to be the cohomology\nof the complex (C-(A, M), d).\nProposition 8.17. One has a natural isomorphism\nHHi(A, M)\nExti\n→\nA-bimod(A, M),\nwhere A-bimod denotes the category of A-bimodules.\nProof. The proof is obtained immediately by considering the bar resolution of the bimodule\nA:\n· · · → A ⊗ A ⊗ A → A ⊗ A → A,\nwhere the bimodule structure on A⊗n is given by\nb(a1 ⊗ a2 ⊗· · · ⊗ an)c = ba1 ⊗ a2 ⊗· · · ⊗ anc,\nand the map ∂n : A⊗n\nA⊗n-1 is given by the formula\n→\n∂n(a1 ⊗ a2 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = a1a2 ⊗· · · ⊗ an -· · · + (-1)n a1 ⊗· · · ⊗ an-1an.\nNote that we have the associative Yoneda product\nHHi(A, M) ⊗ HHj (A, N) → HHi+j (A, M ⊗A N),\ninduced by tensoring of cochains.\nIf M = A, the algebra itself, then we will denote HH-(A, M) by HH-(A). For example,\nHH0(A) is the center of A, and HH1(A) is the quotient of the Lie algebra of derivations of A\nby inner derivations. The Yoneda product induces a graded algebra structure on HH-(A); it\ncan be shown that this algebra is supercommutative.\n\nX\nX\n8.7.3. Hochschild cohomology and deformations. Let A0 be an algebra, and let us look for\n1-parameter deformations A = A0[[~]] of A0. Thus, we look for such series μ which satisfy\nthe associativity equation, modulo the automorphisms of the C[[~]]-module A0[[~]] which are\nthe identity modulo ~. 3\nThe associativity equation μ\n(μ ⊗ Id) = μ\n(Id ⊗ μ) reduces to a hierarchy of linear\n*\n*\nequations:\nN\nN\nμs(μN-s(a, b), c) =\nμs(a, μN-s(b, c)).\ns=0\ns=0\n(These equations are linear in μN if μi, i < N, are known).\nTo study these equations, one can use Hochschild cohomology. Namely, we have the\nfollowing standard facts (due to Gerstenhaber, [Ge]), which can be checked directly.\n(1) The linear equation for μ1 says that μ1 is a Hochschild 2-cocycle. Thus algebra struc\ntures on A0[~]/~2 deforming μ0 are parametrized by the space Z2(A0) of Hochschild\n2-cocycles of A0 with values in M = A0.\n(2) If μ1, μ0\n1 are two 2-cocycles such that μ1 - μ0\n1 is a coboundary, then the algebra struc\ntures on A0[~]/~2 corresponding to μ1 and μ0\n1 are equivalent by a transformation of\nA0[~]/~2 that equals the identity modulo ~, and vice versa. Thus equivalence classes\nof multiplications on A0[~]/~2 deforming μ0 are parametrized by the cohomology\nHH2(A0).\n(3) The linear equation for μN says that dμN is a certain quadratic expression bN in\nμ1, . . . , μN-1. This expression is always a Hochschild 3-cocycle, and the equation is\nsolvable if and only if it is a coboundary. Thus the cohomology class of bN in HH3(A0)\nis the only obstruction to solving this equation.\n8.7.4. Universal deformation. In particular, if HH3(A0) = 0 then the equation for μn can be\nsolved for all n, and for each n the freedom in choosing the solution, modulo equivalences,\nis the space H = HH2(A0). Thus there exists an algebra structure over C[[H]] on the space\nAu := A0[[H]] of formal functions from H to A0, a, b 7→ μu(a, b) ∈ A0[[H]], (a, b ∈ A0), such\nthat μu(a, b)(0) = ab ∈ A0, and every 1-parameter flat formal deformation A of A0 is given\nby the formula μ(a, b)(~) = μu(a, b)(γ(~)) for a unique formal series γ ∈ ~H[[~]], with the\nproperty that γ0(0) is the cohomology class of the cocycle μ1.\nSuch an algebra Au is called a universal deformation of A0. It is unique up to an isomor\nphism (which may involve an automorphism of C[[H]]). 4\nThus in the case HH3(A0) = 0, deformation theory allows us to completely classify 1\nparameter flat formal deformations of A0. In particular, we see that the \"moduli space\"\nparametrizing formal deformations of A0 is a smooth space - it is the formal neighborhood\nof zero in H.\nIf HH3(A0) is nonzero then in general the universal deformation parametrized by H does\nnot exist, as there are obstructions to deformations. In this case, the moduli space of\n3Note that we don't have to worry about the existence of a unit in A since a formal deformation of an\nalgebra with unit always has a unit.\n4In spite of the universal property of Au, it may happen that there is an isomorphism between the algebras\nA1 and A2 corresponding to different paths γ1(~), γ2(~) (of course, reducing to a nontrivial automorphism of\nA0 modulo ~). For this reason, sometimes Au is called a semiuniversal, rather than universal, deformation\nof A0.\n\nM\nM\nM\nO\ndeformations will be a closed subscheme of the formal neighborhood of zero in H, which\nis often singular. On the other hand, even when HH3(A0) =6\n0, the universal deformation\nparametrized by (the formal neighborhood of zero in) H may exist (although its existence\nmay be more difficult to prove than in the vanishing case). In this case one says that the\ndeformations of A0 are unobstructed (since all obstructions vanish even though the space of\nobstructions doesn't).\n8.8. Deformation-theoretic interpretation of symplectic reflection algebras. Let V\nbe a symplectic vector space (over C) and Weyl(V ) the Weyl algebra of V . Let G be a finite\ngroup acting symplectically on V . Then from the definition, we have\nA0 := H1,0[G, V ] = G n Weyl(V ).\nLet us calculate the Hochschild cohomology of this algebra.\nTheorem 8.18 (Alev, Farinati, Lambre, Solotar, [AFLS]). The cohomology space\nHHi(G n Weyl(V )) is naturally isomorphic to the space of conjugation invariant functions\non the set Si of elements g ∈ G such that rank (1 - g)|V = i.\nCorollary 8.19. The odd cohomology of G n Weyl(V ) vanishes, and HH2(G n Weyl(V ))\nis the space C[S]G of conjugation invariant functions on the set of symplectic reflections. In\nparticular, there exists a universal deformation A of A0 = G n Weyl(V ) parametrized by\nC[S]G .\nProof. Directly from the theorem.\n\nProof of Theorem 8.18.\nLemma 8.20. Let B be a C-algebra together with an action of a finite group G. Then\nHH∗(G n B, G n B) = (\nHH∗(B, Bg))G ,\ng∈G\nwhere Bg is the bimodule isomorphic to B as a space where the left action of B is the usual\none and the right action is the usual action twisted by g.\nProof. The algebra G n B is a projective B-module. Therefore, using the Shapiro lemma,\nwe get\nHH∗(G n B, G n B) = Ext∗\n(G×G)n(B⊗Bop)(G n B, G n B)\n= Ext∗\n(B, G n B) = Ext∗\n(B, G n B)G\nGdiagonaln(B⊗Bop)\nB⊗Bop\n= (\nExt∗\nB⊗Bop (B, Bg))G = (\nHH∗(B, Bg))G ,\ng∈G\ng∈G\nas desired.\n\nNow apply the lemma to B = Weyl(V ). For this we need to calculate HH∗(B, Bg),\nwhere g is any element of G. We may assume that g is diagonal in some symplectic basis:\ng = diag(λ1, λ1\n-1, . . . , λn, λn\n-1). Then by the K unneth formula we find that\nn\nHH∗(B, Bg) =\nHH∗(A1, A1gi),\ni=1\n\nwhere A1 is the Weyl algebra of the 2-dimensional space, (generated by x, y with defining\nrelation xy - yx = 1), and gi = diag(λi, λ-1).\ni\nThus we need to calculate HH∗(B, Bg), B = A1, g = diag(λ, λ-1).\nProposition 8.21. HH∗(B, Bg) is 1-dimensional, concentrated in degree 0 if λ = 1 and in\ndegree 2 otherwise.\nProof. If B = A1 then B has the following Koszul resolution as a B-bimodule:\nB ⊗ B → B ⊗ C2 ⊗ B → B ⊗ B → B.\nHere the first map is given by the formula\nb1 ⊗ b2 7→ b1 ⊗ x ⊗ yb2 - b1 ⊗ y ⊗ xb2 - b1y ⊗ x ⊗ b2 + b1x ⊗ y ⊗ b2,\nthe second map is given by\nb1 ⊗ x ⊗ b2 7→ b1x ⊗ b2 - b1 ⊗ xb2,\nb1 ⊗ y ⊗ b2 7→ b1y ⊗ b2 - b1 ⊗ yb2,\nand the third map is the multiplication.\nThus the cohomology of B with coefficients in Bg can be computed by mapping this\nresolution into Bg and taking the cohomology. This yields the following complex C-:\n(8.2)\nBg\nBg ⊕ Bg\nBg\n0,\n→\n→\n→\n→\nwhere the first nontrivial map is given by bg 7→ [bg, y] ⊗ x - [bg, x] ⊗ y, and the second\nnontrivial map is given by bg ⊗ x 7→ [x, bg], bg ⊗ y 7→ [y, bg].\nConsider first the case g = 1. Equip the complex C- with the Bernstein filtration (deg(x) =\ndeg(y) = 1), starting with 0, 1, 2, for C0, C1, C2, respectively (this makes the differential\npreserve the filtration). Consider the associated graded complex C- . In this complex,\ngr\nbrackets are replaced with Poisson brackets, and thus it is easy to see that C- is the De\ngr\nRham complex for the affine plane, so its cohomology is C in degree 0 and 0 in other degrees.\nTherefore, the cohomology of C- is the same.\nNow consider g = 1. In this case, declare that\nC0, C1, C2 start in degrees 2,1,0 respectively\n(which makes the differential preserve the filtration), and again consider the graded complex\nC- . The graded Euler characteristic of this complex is (t2 - 2t + 1)(1 - t)-2 = 1.\ngr\nThe cohomology in the C0 term is the set of b ∈ C[x, y] such that ab = bag for all a. This\ngr\nmeans that HH0 = 0.\nThe cohomology of the C2 term is the quotient of C[x, y] by the ideal generated by a - ag,\ngr\na ∈ C[x, y]. Thus the cohomology HH2 of the rightmost term is 1-dimensional, in degree 0.\nBy the Euler characteristic argument, this implies that HH1 = 0. The cohomology of the\nfiltered complex C- is therefore the same, and we are done.\n\nThe proposition implies that in the n-dimensional case HH∗(B, Bg) is 1-dimensional, con\ncentrated in degree rank (1 - g). It is not hard to check that the group G acts on the sum\nof these 1-dimensional spaces by simply permuting the basis vectors. Thus the theorem is\nproved.\n\nRemark 8.22. Another proof of Theorem 8.18 is given in [Pi].\nTheorem 8.23. The algebra H1,c[G, V ], with formal c, is the universal deformation of\nH1,0[G, V ] = G n Weyl(V ). More specifically, the map f : C[S]G → HH2(G n Weyl(V ))\ninduced by this deformation coincides with the isomorphism of Corollary 8.19.\n\nX\nP\nX\nProof. The proof (which we will not give) can be obtained by a direct computation with the\nKoszul resolution for G n Weyl(V ). Such a proof is given in [Pi]. The paper [EG] proves\na slightly weaker statement that the map f is an isomorphism, which suffices to show that\nH1,c(G, V ) is the universal deformation of H1,0[G, V ].\n\n8.9. Finite dimensional representations of H0,c. Let Mc = SpecZ0,c. We can regard\nH0,c = H0,c[G, V ] as a finitely generated module over Z0,c = O(Mc). Let χ ∈ Mc be a central\ncharacter, χ : Z0,c → C. Denote by hχi the ideal in H0,c generated by the kernel of χ.\nProposition 8.24. If χ is generic then H0,c/hχi is the matrix algebra of size |G|. In par\nticular, H0,c has a unique irreducible representation Vχ with central character χ. This repre\nsentation is isomorphic to CG as a G-module.\nProof. It is shown by a standard argument (which we will skip) that it is sufficient to check\nthe statement in the associated graded case c = 0. In this case, for generic χ, G n SV/hχi =\nG n Fun(Oχ), where Oχ is the (free) orbit of G consisting of the points of V ∗ that map to\nχ ∈ V ∗/G, and Fun(Oχ) is the algebra of functions on Oχ. It is easy to see that this algebra\nis isomorphic to a matrix algebra, and has a unique irreducible representation, Fun(Oχ),\nwhich is a regular representation of G.\n\nCorollary 8.25. Any irreducible representation of H0,c has dimension ≤|G|.\nProof. We will use the following lemma.\nLemma 8.26 (The Amitsur-Levitzki identity). For any N × N matrices X1, . . . , X2N with\nentries in a commutative ring A,\n(-1)σXσ(1) · · · Xσ(2N) = 0.\nσ∈S2n\nProof. Consider the ring MatN (A) ⊗∧(ξ1, . . . , ξ2n). Let X =\ni Xiξi ∈ R. So we have\nX2 =\n[Xi, Xj ]ξiξj ∈ MatN (A ⊗∧even(ξ1, . . . , ξ2n)).\ni<j\nIt is obvious that Tr X2 = 0. Similarly, one can easily show that Tr X4 = 0, . . . , Tr X2N = 0.\nSince the ring A ⊗∧even(ξ1, . . . , ξ2n) is commutative, from the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we\nknow that X2N = 0 which implies the lemma.\n\nSince for generic χ the algebra H0,c/hχi is a matrix algebra, the algebra H0,c satisfies the\nAmitsur-Levitzki identity. Next, note that since H0,c is a finitely generated Z0,c-module (by\npassing to the associated graded and using Hilbert's theorem), every irreducible representa\ntion of H0,c is finite dimensional. If H0,c had an irreducible representation E of dimension\nm > |G|, then by the density theorem the matrix algebra Matm would be a quotient of\nH0,c. But one can show that the Amitsur-Levitzki identity of degree |G| is not satisfied for\nmatrices of bigger size than |G|. Contradiction. Thus, dim E ≤|G|, as desired.\n\nIn general, for special central characters there are representations of H0,c of dimension less\nthan |G|. However, in some cases one can show that all irreducible representations have\ndimension exactly G . For example, we have the following result.\n| |\n\nTheorem 8.27. Let G = Sn, V = h ⊕ h∗, h = Cn (the rational Cherednik algebra for Sn).\nThen for c = 0, every irreducible representation of H0,c has dimension n! and is isomorphic\nto the regular representation of Sn.\nProof. Let E be an irreducible representation of H0,c. Let us calculate the trace in E of any\npermutation σ = 1. Let j be an index such that σ(j) = i = j. Then sij σ(j) = j. Hence in\nH0,c we have\n[yj , xisij σ] = [yj, xi]sij σ = csij\n2 σ = cσ.\nHence Tr E (σ) = 0, and thus E is a multiple of the regular representation of Sn. But by\nTheorem 8.25, dim E ≤ n!, so we get that E is the regular representation, as desired.\n\n8.10. Azumaya algebras. Let Z be a finitely generated commutative algebra over C, M =\nSpecZ the corresponding affine scheme, and A a finitely generated Z-algebra.\nDefinition 8.28. A is said to be an Azumaya algebra of degree N if the completion Aˆχ of\nA at every maximal ideal χ in Z is the matrix algebra of size N over the completion Zˆχ of\nZ.\nThus, an Azumaya algebra should be thought of as a bundle of matrix algebras on M. 5\nFor example, if E is an algebraic vector bundle on M then End(E) is an Azumaya algebra.\nHowever, not all Azumaya algebras are of this form.\nExample 8.29. For q ∈ C∗, consider the quantum torus\nTq = ChX±1, Y ±1i/hXY - qY Xi.\nIf q is a root of unity of order N, then the center of Tq is hX±N , Y ±N i = C[M] where\nM = (C∗)2 . It is not difficult to show that Tq is an Azumaya algebra of degree N, but\nTq ⊗C[M] C(M) ∼6= MatN (C(M)), so Tq is not the endomorphism algebra of a vector bundle.\nExample 8.30. Let X be a smooth irreducible variety over a field of characteristic p. Then\nD(X), the algebra of differential operators on X, is an Azumaya algebra with rank pdim X ,\nwhich is not an endomorphism algebra of a vector bundle. Its center is Z = O(T ∗X)F, the\nFrobenius twisted functions on T ∗X.\nIt is clear that if A is an Azumaya algebra (say, over C) then for every central character\nχ of A, A/hχi is the algebra MatN (C) of complex N by N matrices, and every irreducible\nrepresentation of A has dimension N.\nThe following important result is due to M. Artin.\nTheorem 8.31. Let A be a finitely generated (over C) polynomial identity (PI) algebra of\ndegree N (i.e. all the polynomial relations of the matrix algebra of size N are satisfied in\nA). Then A is an Azumaya algebra if and only if every irreducible representation of A has\ndimension exactly N.\nProof. See [Ar] Theorem 8.3.\n\n5If M is not affine, one can define, in a standard manner, the notion of a sheaf of Azumaya algebras on\nM.\n\nThus, by Theorem 8.27, for G = Sn, the rational Cherednik algebra H0,c(Sn, Cn) for c = 0\nis an Azumaya algebra of degree n!. Indeed, this algebra is PI of degree n! because the clas\nsical Dunkl representation embeds it into matrices of size n! over C(x1, . . . , xn, p1, . . . , pn)Sn .\nLet us say that χ ∈ M is an Azumaya point if for some affine neighborhood U of χ the\nlocalization of A to U is an Azumaya algebra. Obviously, the set Az(M) of Azumaya points\nof M is open.\nNow we come back to the study the space Mc corresponding to a symplectic reflection\nalgebra H0,c.\nTheorem 8.32. The set Az(Mc) coincides with the set of smooth points of Mc.\nThe proof of this theorem is given in the following two subsections.\nCorollary 8.33. If G = Sn and V = h ⊕ h∗, h = Cn (the rational Cherednik algebra case)\nthen Mc is a smooth algebraic variety for c = 0.\nProof. Directly from the above theorem.\n\n8.11. Cohen-Macaulay property and homological dimension. To prove Theorem 8.32,\nwe will need some commutative algebra tools. Let Z be a finitely generated commutative\nalgebra over C without zero divisors. By Noether's normalization lemma, there exist ele\nments z1, . . . , zn ∈ Z which are algebraically independent, such that Z is a finitely generated\nmodule over C[z1, . . . , zn].\nDefinition 8.34. The algebra Z (or the variety SpecZ) is said to be Cohen-Macaulay if Z\nis a locally free (=projective) module over C[z1, . . . , zn]. 6\nRemark 8.35. It was shown by Serre that if Z is locally free over C[z1, . . . , zn] for some\nchoice of z1, . . . , zn, then it happens for any choice of them (such that Z is finitely generated\nas a module over C[z1, . . . , zn]).\nRemark 8.36. Another definition of the Cohen-Macaulay property is that the dualizing\ncomplex ωZ\n- of Z is concentrated in degree zero. We will not discuss this definition here.\nIt can be shown that the Cohen-Macaulay property is stable under localization. Therefore,\nit makes sense to make the following definition.\nDefinition 8.37. An algebraic variety X is Cohen-Macaulay if the algebra of functions on\nevery affine open set in X is Cohen-Macaulay.\nLet Z be a finitely generated commutative algebra over C without zero divisors, and let\nM be a finitely generated module over Z.\nDefinition 8.38. M is said to be Cohen-Macaulay if for some algebraically independent\nz1, . . . , zn ∈ Z such that Z is finitely generated over C[z1, . . . , zn], M is locally free over\nC[z1, . . . , zn].\nAgain, if this happens for some z1, . . . , zn, then it happens for any of them. We also\nnote that M can be Cohen-Macaulay without Z being Cohen-Macaulay, and that Z is a\nCohen-Macaulay algebra iff it is a Cohen-Macaulay module over itself.\nWe will need the following standard properties of Cohen-Macaulay algebras and modules.\n6It was proved by Quillen that a locally free module over a polynomial algebra is free; this is a difficult\ntheorem, which will not be needed here.\n\nTheorem 8.39.\n(i) Let Z1 ⊂ Z2 be a finite extension of finitely generated commutative\nC-algebras, without zero divisors, and M be a finitely generated module over Z2. Then\nM is Cohen-Macaulay over Z2 iff it is Cohen-Macaulay over Z1.\n(ii) Suppose that Z is the algebra of functions on a smooth affine variety. Then a Z-\nmodule M is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if it is projective.\nProof. The proof can be found in the text book [Ei].\n\nIn particular, this shows that the algebra of functions on a smooth affine variety is Cohen-\nMacaulay. Algebras of functions on many singular varieties are also Cohen-Macaulay.\nExample 8.40. The algebra of regular functions on the cone xy = z2 is Cohen-Macaulay.\nThis algebra can be identified as C[a, b]Z2 by letting x = a2, y = b2 and z = ab, where the Z2\naction is defined by a 7→ -a, b 7→ -b. It contains a subalgebra C[a2, b2], and as a module\nover this subalgebra, it is free of rank 2 with generators 1, ab.\nExample 8.41. Any irreducible affine algebraic curve is Cohen-Macaulay. For example, the\nalgebra of regular functions on y2 = x3 is isomorphic to the subalgebra of C[t] spanned by\n1, t2, t3 , . . .. It contains a subalgebra C[t2] and as a module over this subalgebra, it is free of\nrank 2 with generators 1, t3 .\nExample 8.42. Consider the subalgebra in C[x, y] spanned by 1 and xiyj with i+j ≥ 2. It is\na finite generated module over C[x2, y2], but not free. So this algebra is not Cohen-Macaulay.\nAnother tool we will need is homological dimension. We will say that an algebra A has\nhomological dimension ≤ d if any (left) A-module M has a projective resolution of length\n≤ d. The homological dimension of A is the smallest integer having this property. If such\nan integer does not exist, A is said to have infinite homological dimension.\nIt is easy to show that the homological dimension of A is ≤ d if and only if for any A-\nmodules M, N one has Exti(M, N) = 0 for i > d. Also, the homological dimension clearly\ndoes not decrease under taking associated graded of the algebra under a positive filtration\n(this is clear from considering the spectral sequence attached to the filtration).\nIt follows immediately from this definition that homological dimension is Morita invariant.\nNamely, recall that a Morita equivalence between algebras A and B is an equivalence of\ncategories A-mod\nB-mod. Such an equivalence maps projective modules to projective\n→\nones, since projectivity is a categorical property (P is projective if and only if the functor\nHom(P, ) is exact). This implies that if A and B are Morita equivalent then their homological\n·\ndimensions are the same.\nThen we have the following important theorem.\nTheorem 8.43. The homological dimension of a commutative finitely generated C-algebra\nZ is finite if and only if Z is regular, i.e. is the algebra of functions on a smooth affine\nvariety.\n8.12. Proof of Theorem 8.32. First let us show that any smooth point χ of Mc is an\nAzumaya point. Since H0,c = EndB0,c H0,ce = EndZ0,c (H0,ce), it is sufficient to show that\nthe coherent sheaf on Mc corresponding to the module H0,ce is a vector bundle near χ. By\nTheorem 8.39 (ii), for this it suffices to show that H0,ce is a Cohen-Macaulay Z0,c-module.\nTo do so, first note that the statement is true for c = 0. Indeed, in this case the claim is\nthat SV is a Cohen-Macaulay module over (SV )G . But SV is a polynomial algebra, which\nis Cohen-Macaulay, so the result follows from Theorem 8.39, (i).\n\nNow, we claim that if Z, M are positively filtered and grM is a Cohen-Macaulay grZ\nmodule then M is a Cohen-Macaulay Z-module. Indeed, let z1, . . . , zn be homogeneous\nalgebraically independent elements of grZ such that grZ is a finite module over the subalge\nbra generated by them. Let z1\n0 , . . . , zn\n0 be their liftings to Z. Then z1\n0 , . . . , zn\n0 are algebraically\nindependent, and the module M over C[z1\n0 , . . . , zn\n0 ] is finitely generated and (locally) free since\nso is the module grM over C[z1, . . . , zn].\nRecall now that grH0,ce = SV , grZ0,c = (SV )G . Thus the c = 0 case implies the general\ncase, and we are done.\nNow let us show that any Azumaya point of Mc is smooth. Let U be an affine open set\nin Mc consisting of Azumaya points. Then the localization H0,c(U) := H0,c ⊗Z0,c OU is an\nAzumaya algebra. Moreover, for any χ ∈ U, the unique irreducible representation of H0,c(U)\nwith central character χ is the regular representation of G (since this holds for generic χ by\nProposition 8.24). This means that e is a rank 1 idempotent in H0,c(U)/hχi for all χ. In\nparticular, H0,c(U)e is a vector bundle on U. Thus the functor F : OU -mod\nH0,c(U)-mod\n→\ngiven by the formula F (Y ) = H0,c(U)e ⊗OU Y is an equivalence of categories (the quasi-\ninverse functor is given by the formula F -1(N) = eN). Thus H0,c(U) is Morita equivalent\nto OU , and therefore their homological dimensions are the same.\nOn the other hand, the homological dimension of H0,c is finite (in fact, it equals to dim V ).\nTo show this, note that by the Hilbert syzygies theorem, the homological dimension of\nSV is dim V . Hence, so is the homological dimension of G n SV (as Ext∗\n(M, N) =\nGnSV\nExt∗ (M, N)G). Thus, since grH0,c = G n SV , we get that H0,c has homological dimension\nSV\n≤ dim V . Hence, the homological dimension of H0,c(U) is also ≤ dim V (as the homological\ndimension clearly does not increase under the localization). But H0,c(U) is Morita equivalent\nto OU , so OU has a finite homological dimension. By Theorem 8.43, this implies that U\nconsists of smooth points.\nCorollary 8.44. Az(Mc) is also the set of points at which the Poisson structure of Mc is\nsymplectic.\nProof. The variety Mc is symplectic outside of a subset of codimension 2, because so is M0.\nThus the set S of smooth points of Mc where the top exterior power of the Poisson bivector\nvanishes is of codimension ≥ 2. Since the top exterior power of the Poisson bivector is locally\na regular function, this implies that S is empty. Thus, every smooth point is symplectic, and\nthe corollary follows from the theorem.\n\n8.13. Notes. Our exposition in this section follows Section 8 - Section 10 of [E4].\n\n9. Calogero-Moser spaces\n9.1. Hamiltonian reduction along an orbit. Let M be an affine algebraic variety and\nG a reductive algebraic group. Suppose M is Poisson and the action of G preserves the\nPoisson structure. Let g be the Lie algebra of G and g∗ the dual of g. Let μ : M → g∗ be a\nmoment map for this action (we assume it exists). It induces a map μ∗ : Sg → C[M].\nLet O be a closed coadjoint orbit of G, IO be the ideal in Sg corresponding to O, and let\nJO be the ideal in C[M] generated by μ∗(IO). Then JG is a Poisson ideal in C[M]G, and\nO\nA = C[M]G/JG is a Poisson algebra.\nO\nGeometrically, Spec(A) = μ-1(O)/G (categorical quotient). It can also be written as\nμ-1(z)/Gz, where z ∈ O and Gz is the stabilizer of z in G.\nDefinition 9.1. The scheme μ-1(O)/G is called the Hamiltonian reduction of M with respect\nto G along O. We will denote by R(M, G, O).\nThe following proposition is standard.\nProposition 9.2. If M is a symplectic variety and the action of G on μ-1(O) is free, then\nR(M, G, O) is a symplectic variety, of dimension dim(M) - 2 dim(G) + dim(O).\n9.2. The Calogero-Moser space. Let M = T ∗Matn(C), and G = PGLn(C) (so g =\nsln(C)). Using the trace form we can identify g∗ with g, and M with Matn(C) ⊕ Matn(C).\nThen a moment map is given by the formula μ(X, Y ) = [X, Y ], for X, Y ∈ Matn(C).\nLet O be the orbit of the matrix diag(-1, -1, . . . , -1, n - 1), i.e. the set of traceless\nmatrices T such that T + 1 has rank 1.\nDefinition 9.3 (Kazhdan, Kostant, Sternberg, [KKS]). The scheme Cn := R(M, G, O) is\ncalled the Calogero-Moser space.\nProposition 9.4. The action of G on μ-1(O) is free, and thus (by Proposition 9.2) Cn is a\nsmooth symplectic variety (of dimension 2n).\nProof. It suffices to show that if X, Y are such that XY - Y X + 1 has rank 1, then (X, Y )\nis an irreducible set of matrices. Indeed, in this case, by Schur's lemma, if B ∈ GLn is such\nthat BX = XB and BY = Y B then B is a scalar, so the stabilizer of (X, Y ) in PGLn is\ntrivial.\nTo show this, assume that W =6\n0 is an invariant subspace of X, Y . In this case, the\neigenvalues of [X, Y ] on W are a subcollection of the collection of n - 1 copies of -1 and\none copy of n - 1. The sum of the elements of this subcollection must be zero, since it is the\ntrace of [X, Y ] on W. But then the subcollection must be the entire collection, so W = Cn ,\nas desired.\n\nThus, Cn is the space of conjugacy classes of pairs of n × n matrices (X, Y ) such that the\nmatrix XY - Y X + 1 has rank 1.\nIn fact, one also has the following more complicated theorem.\nTheorem 9.5 (G. Wilson, [Wi]). The Calogero-Moser space is connected.\nWe will give a proof of this theorem later, in Subsection 9.4.\n\n9.3. The Calogero-Moser integrable system. Let M be a symplectic variety, and let\nH1, . . . , Hn be regular functions on M such that {Hi, Hj } = 0 and Hi's are algebraically\nindependent everywhere. Assume that M carries a symplectic action of a reductive algebraic\ngroup G with moment map μ : M → g∗, which preserves the functions Hi, and let O be\na coadjoint orbit of G. Assume that G acts freely on μ-1(O), and so the Calogero-Moser\nspace R(M, G, O) is symplectic. The functions Hi descend to R(M, G, O). If they are still\nalgebraically independent and n = dim R(M, G, O)/2, then we get an integrable system on\nR(M, G, O).\nA vivid example of this is the Kazhdan-Kostant-Sternberg construction of the Calogero-\nMoser system. In this case M = T ∗Matn(C) (regarded as the set of pairs of matrices (X, Y )\nas in Section 9.2), with the usual symplectic form ω = Tr (dY ∧ dX). Let Hi = Tr (Y i),\ni = 1, . . . , n. Let G = PGLn(C) act on M by conjugation, and let O be the coadjoint\norbit of G considered in Subsection 9.2. Then the system H1, . . . , Hn descends to a system\nof functions in involution on R(M, G, O), which is the Calogero-Moser space Cn. Since\nthis space is 2n-dimensional, H1, . . . , Hn form an integrable system on Cn. It is called the\n(rational) Calogero-Moser system.\nThe Calogero-Moser flow is, by definition, the Hamiltonian flow on Cn defined by the\nHamiltonian H = H2 = Tr (Y 2). Thus this flow is integrable, in the sense that it can be\nincluded in an integrable system. In particular, its solutions can be found in quadratures\nusing the inductive procedure of reduction of order. However (as often happens with systems\nobtained by reduction), solutions can also be found by a much simpler procedure, since\nthey can be found already on the \"non-reduced\" space M: indeed, on M the Calogero-\nMoser flow is just the motion of a free particle in the space of matrices, so it has the form\ngt(X, Y ) = (X + 2Y t, Y ). The same formula is valid on Cn. In fact, we can use the same\nmethod to compute the flows corresponding to all the Hamiltonians Hi = Tr (Y i), i ∈ N:\nthese flows are given by the formulas\ngt\n(i)(X, Y ) = (X + iY i-1t, Y ).\nLet us write the Calogero-Moser system explicitly in coordinates. To do so, we first need\nto introduce local coordinates on the Calogero-Moser space Cn.\nTo this end, let us restrict our attention to the open set Un\nwhich consists of\n⊂Cn\nconjugacy classes of those pairs (X, Y ) for which the matrix X is diagonalizable, with distinct\neigenvalues; by Wilson's Theorem 9.5, this open set is dense in Cn.\nA point P ∈ Un may be represented by a pair (X, Y ) such that X = diag(x1, . . . , xn),\nxi = xj . In this case, the entries of T := XY - Y X are (xi - xj )yij . In particular, the\ndiagonal entries are zero. Since the matrix T + 1 has rank 1, its entries κij have the form\naibj for some numbers ai, bj . On the other hand, κii = 1, so bj = a-\nj\n1 and hence κij = aia-\nj\n1 .\nBy conjugating (X, Y ) by the matrix diag(a1, . . . , an), we can reduce to the situation when\nai = 1, so κij = 1. Hence the matrix T has entries 1 - δij (zeros on the diagonal, ones off\nthe diagonal). Moreover, the representative of P with diagonal X and T as above is unique\nup to the action of the symmetric group Sn. Finally, we have (xi - xj )yij = 1 for i =6\nj, so\nthe entries of the matrix Y are yij = 1/(xi - xj) if i =6\nj. On the other hand, the diagonal\nentries yii of Y are unconstrained. Thus we have obtained the following result.\nProposition 9.6. Let Cn be the open set of (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Cn such that xi =6\nxj for i =6\nj.\nreg\nThen there exists an isomorphism of algebraic varieties ξ : T ∗(Cn /Sn)\nUn given by the\nreg\n→\n\nX\nX\nP\nP\nformula\n(x1, . . . , xn, p1, . . . , pn) 7→ (X, Y ),\nwhere X = diag(x1, . . . , xn), and Y = Y (x, p) := (yij ),\nyij =\n, i = j, yii = pi.\nxi - xj\nIn fact, we have a stronger result:\nProposition 9.7. ξ is an isomorphism of symplectic varieties (where the cotangent bundle\nis equipped with the usual symplectic structure).\nFor the proof of Proposition 9.7, we will need the following general and important but\neasy theorem.\nTheorem 9.8 (The necklace bracket formula). Let a1, . . . , ar and b1, . . . , bs be either X or\nY . Then on M we have\n{Tr (a1 · · · ar), Tr (b1 · · · bs)} =\nTr (ai+1 · · · ara1 · · · ai-1bj+1 · · · bsb1 · · · bj-1) -\n(i,j):ai=Y,bj =X\nTr (ai+1 · · · ara1 · · · ai-1bj+1 · · · bsb1 · · · bj-1).\n(i,j):ai=X,bj =Y\nProof of Proposition 9.7. Let ak = Tr (Xk), bk = Tr (XkY ). It is easy to check using the\nnecklace bracket formula that on M we have\n{am, ak} = 0,\n{bm, ak} = kam+k-1,\n{bm, bk} = (k - m)bm+k-1.\nOn the other hand, ξ∗ak =\nxi\nk , ξ∗bk =\nxi\nkpi. Thus we see that\n{f, g} = {ξ∗f, ξ∗g},\nwhere f, g are either ak or bk. But the functions ak, bk, k = 0, . . . , n - 1, form a local\ncoordinate system near a generic point of Un, so we are done.\n\nNow let us write the Hamiltonian of the Calogero-Moser system in coordinates. It has the\nform\nX\nX\n(9.1)\nH = Tr (Y (x, p)2) =\npi\n2 -\n(xi - xj )2 .\ni\ni=j\nThus the Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian describes the motion of a system of n particles on the\nline with interaction potential -1/x2, which we considered in Section 2.\nNow we finally see the usefulness of the Hamiltonian reduction procedure. The point is\nthat it is not clear at all from formula (9.1) why the Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian should be\ncompletely integrable. However, our reduction procedure implies the complete integrability\nof H, and gives an explicit formula for the first integrals: 7\nHi = Tr (Y (x, p)i).\nMoreover, this procedure immediately gives us an explicit solution of the system. Namely,\nassume that x(t), p(t) is the solution with initial condition x(0), p(0). Let (X0, Y0) =\n7Thus, for type A we have two methods of proving the integrability of the Calogero-Moser system - one\nusing Dunkl operators and one using Hamiltonian reduction.\n\nξ(x(0), p(0)). Then xi(t) are the eigenvalues of the matrix Xt := X0 + 2tY0, and pi(t) =\nx0\ni(t)/2.\n9.4. Proof of Wilson's theorem. Let us now give a proof of Theorem 9.5.\nWe have already shown that all components of Cn are smooth and have dimension 2n.\nAlso, we know that there is at least one component (the closure of Un), and that the other\ncomponents, if they exist, do not contain pairs (X, Y ) in which X is regular semisimple.\nThis means that these components are contained in the Qhypersurface Δ(X) = 0, where\nΔ(X) stands for the discriminant of X (i.e., Δ(X) :=\ni=j (xi - xj ), where xi are the\neigenvalues of X).\nThus, to show that such additional components don't in fact exist, it suffices to show that\nthe dimension of the subscheme Cn(0) cut out in Cn by the equation Δ(X) = 0 is 2n - 1.\nTo do so, first notice that the condition rank ([X, Y ] + 1) = 1 is equivalent to the equa\ntion ∧2([X, Y ] + 1) = 0; thus, the latter can be used as the equation defining Cn inside\nT ∗Matn/P GLn.\nDefine C0 := Spec(grO(Cn)) to be the degeneration of Cn (we use the filtration on O(Cn)\nn\ndefined by deg(X) = 0, deg(Y ) = 1). Then Cn\n0 is a closed subscheme in the scheme Cen\n0 cut\nout by the equations ∧2([X, Y ]) = 0 in T ∗Matn/PGLn.\nLet ( Cen\n0)red be the reduced part of Cen\n0 . Then ( Cen\n0)red coincides with the categorical quotient\n{(X, Y )|rank ([X, Y ]) ≤ 1}/PGLn.\nOur proof is based on the following proposition.\nProposition 9.9. The categorical quotient {(X, Y )|rank ([X, Y ]) ≤ 1}/PGLn coincides with\nthe categorical quotient {(X, Y )|[X, Y ] = 0}/PGLn.\nProof. It is clear that {(X, Y )|[X, Y ] = 0}/PGLn is contained in {(X, Y )|rank ([X, Y ]) ≤\n1}/PGLn. For the proof of the opposite inclusion we need to show that any regular function\non {(X, Y )|rank ([X, Y ]) ≤ 1}/PGLn is completely determined by its values on the subvariety\n{(X, Y )|[X, Y ] = 0}/PGLn, i.e. that any invariant polynomial on the set of pairs of matrices\nwith commutator of rank at most 1 is completely determined by its values on pairs of\ncommuting matrices. To this end, we need the following lemma from linear algebra.\nLemma 9.10. If A, B are square matrices such that [A, B] has rank ≤ 1, then there exists\na basis in which both A, B are upper triangular.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we can assume ker A =6\n0 (by replacing A with A - λ if\nneeded) and that A = 0. It suffices to show that there exists a proper nonzero subspace\ninvariant under A, B; then the statement will follow by induction in dimension.\nLet C = [A, B] and suppose rank C = 1 (since the case rank C = 0 is trivial). If ker A ⊂\nker C, then ker A is B-invariant: if Av = 0 then ABv = BAv + Cv = 0. Thus ker A is the\nrequired subspace. If ker A * ker C, then there exists a vector v such that Av = 0 but Cv = 0.\nSo ABv = Cv =6\n0. Thus ImC ⊂ ImA. So ImA is B-invariant: BAv = ABv + Cv ∈ ImA.\nSo ImA is the required subspace.\nThis proves the lemma.\n\nNow we are ready to prove Proposition 9.9. By the fundamental theorem of invariant\ntheory, the ring of invariants of X and Y is generated by traces of words of X and Y :\nTr(w(X, Y )). If X and Y are upper triangular with eigenvalues xi, yi, then any such trace\n\nP\nP\nP\nQ\nm\nr\nhas the form\nxi yi , i.e. coincides with the value of the corresponding invariant on the\ndiagonal parts Xdiag, Ydiag of X and Y , which commute. The proposition is proved.\n\nWe will also need the following proposition:\nProposition 9.11. The categorical quotient {(X, Y ) [X, Y ] = 0}/PGLn is isomorphic to\n(Cn × Cn)/Sn, i.e. its function algebra is C[x1, . . . , xn\n|\n, y1, . . . , yn]Sn .\nProof. Restriction to diagonal matrices defines a homomorphism\nξ : O({(X, Y )|[X, Y ] = 0}/PGLn) → C[x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn]Sn .\nSince (as explained in the proof of Proposition 9.9), any invariant polynomial of entries of\ncommuting matrices is determined by its values on diagonal matrices, this map is injective.\nm\nr\nAlso, ξ(Tr (XmY r)) =\nxi yi , where xi, yi are the eigenvalues of X and Y .\nNow we use the following well known theorem of H. Weyl (from his book \"Classical\ngroups\").\nTheorem 9.12. Let B be an algebra over C. Then the algebra SnB is generated by elements\nof the form\nb ⊗ 1 ⊗· · · ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ b ⊗· · · ⊗ 1 + · · · + 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗· · · ⊗ b.\nProof. Since SnB is linearly spanned by elements of the form x ⊗· · · ⊗ x, x ∈ B, it suffices\nto prove the theorem in the special case B = C[x]. In this case, the result is simply the fact\nthat the ring of symmetric functions is generated by power sums, which is well known.\n\n]Sn\nm\nr\nCorollary 9.13. The ring C[x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn\nis generated by the polynomials\nxi yi\nfor m, r ≥ 0, m + r > 0.\nProof. Apply Theorem 9.12 in the case B = C[x, y].\n\nCorollary 9.13 implies that ξ is surjective. Proposition 9.11 is proved.\n\nNow we are ready to prove Wilson's theorem. Let Cn(0)0 be the degeneration of Cn(0), i.e.\nthe subscheme of C0 cut out by the equation Δ(X) = 0. According to Propositions 9.9 and\nn\n9.11, the reduced part (Cn(0)0)red is contained in the hypersurface in (Cn × Cn)/Sn cut out\nby the equation\n(xi - xj ) = 0. This hypersurface has dimension 2n - 1, so we are done.\ni<j\n9.5. The Gan-Ginzburg theorem. Let Comm(n) be the commuting scheme defined in\nT ∗Matn = Matn × Matn by the equations [X, Y ] = 0, X, Y ∈ Matn. Let G = PGLn, and\nconsider the categorical quotient Comm(n)/G (i.e., the Hamiltonian reduction μ-1(0)/G of\nT ∗Matn by the action of G), whose algebra of regular functions is A = C[Comm(n)]G .\nIt is not known whether the commuting scheme Comm(n) is reduced (i.e. whether the\ncorresponding ideal is a radical ideal); this is a well known open problem. The underlying\nvariety is irreducible (as was shown by Gerstenhaber [Ge1]), but very singular, and has a\nvery complicated structure. However, we have the following result.\nTheorem 9.14 (Gan, Ginzburg, [GG]). Comm(n)/G is reduced, and isomorphic to C2n/Sn.\nThus A = C[x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn]Sn . The Poisson bracket on this algebra is induced from\nthe standard symplectic structure on C2n .\n\nX\nSketch of the proof. Look at the almost commuting variety Mn ⊂ gl × gl × Cn × (Cn)∗\nn\nn\ndefined by\nMn = {(X, Y, v, f)|[X, Y ] + v ⊗ f = 0}.\nGan and Ginzburg proved the following result.\nTheorem 9.15. Mn is a complete intersection. It has n +1 irreducible components denoted\nby Mi , labeled by i = dim ChX, Y iv. Also, Mn is generically reduced.\nn\nSince Mn is generically reduced and is a complete intersection, by a standard result of\ncommutative algebra it is reduced. Thus C[Mn] has no nonzero nilpotents. This implies\nC[Mn]G has no nonzero nilpotents.\nHowever, it is easy to show that the algebra C[Mn]G is isomorphic to the algebra of\ninvariant polynomials of entries of X and Y modulo the \"rank 1\" relation ∧2[X, Y ] = 0. By\na scheme-theoretic version of Proposition 9.9 (proved in [EG]), the latter is isomorphic to\nA. This implies the theorem (the statement about Poisson structures is checked directly in\ncoordinates on the open part where X is regular semisimple).\n\n9.6. The space Mc for Sn and the Calogero-Moser space. Let H0,c = H0,c[Sn, V ] be\nthe symplectic reflection algebra of the symmetric group Sn and space V = h ⊕ h∗, where\nh = Cn (i.e., the rational Cherednik algebra H0,c(Sn, h)). Let Mc = Spec B0,c[Sn, V ] be the\nCalogero-Moser space defined in Section 8.5. It is a symplectic variety for c = 0.\nTheorem 9.16. For c = 0\nthe space Mc is isomorphic to the Calogero-Moser space Cn as a\nsymplectic variety.\nProof. To prove the theorem, we will first construct a map f : Mc\n, and then prove that\n→Cn\nf is an isomorphism.\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that c = 1. As we have shown before, the\nalgebra H0,c is an Azumaya algebra. Therefore, Mc can be regarded as the moduli space of\nirreducible representations of H0,c.\nLet E ∈ Mc be an irreducible representation of H0,c. We have seen before that E has\ndimension n! and is isomorphic to the regular representation as a representation of Sn. Let\nSn-1 ⊂ Sn be the subgroup which preserves the element 1. Then the space of invariants\nESn-1 has dimension n. On this space we have operators X, Y : ESn-1\nESn-1 obtained\n→\nby restriction of the operators x1, y1 on E to the subspace of invariants. We have\nn\n[X, Y ] = T :=\ns1i.\ni=2\nLet us now calculate the right hand side of this equation explicitly. Let e be the symmetrizer\nof Sn-1. Let us realize the regular representation E of Sn as C[Sn] with action of Sn by\nleft multiplication. Then v1 = e, v2 = es12, . . . , vn = es1n is a basis of ESn-1 . The element\nT commutes with e, so we have\nX\nTvi =\nvj .\nj=i\nThis means that T +1 has rank 1, and hence the pair (X, Y ) defines a point on the Calogero-\nMoser space Cn. 8\n8Note that the pair (X, Y ) is well defined only up to conjugation, because the representation E is well\ndefined only up to an isomorphism.\n\nX X\nP\nP\nWe now set (X, Y ) = f(E). It is clear that f : Mc\nis a regular map. So it remains to\n→Cn\nshow that f is an isomorphism. This is equivalent to showing that the corresponding map\nof function algebras f ∗ : O(Cn) → B0,c is an isomorphism.\nLet us calculate f and f ∗ more explicitly. To do so, consider the open set U in Mc consisting\nof representations in which xi -xj acts invertibly. These are exactly the representations that\nare obtained by restricting representations of Sn n C[x1, . . . , xn, p1, . . . , pn, δ(x)-1] using the\nclassical Dunkl embedding. Thus representations E ∈ U are of the form E = Eλ,μ (λ, μ ∈ Cn ,\nand λ has distinct coordinates), where Eλ,μ is the space of complex valued functions on the\norbit Oλ,μ ⊂ C2n, with the following action of H0,c:\nX (sijF )(a, b)\n(xiF )(a, b) = aiF (a, b),\n(yiF )(a, b) = biF (a, b) +\n.\nai - aj\nj=i\n(the group Sn acts by permutations).\nNow let us consider the space ESn-1 . A basis of this space is formed by characteristic\nλ,μ\nfunctions of Sn-1-orbits on Oλ,μ. Using the above presentation, it is straightforward to\ncalculate the matrices of the operators X and Y in this basis:\nX = diag(λ1, . . . , λn),\nand\nYij = μi if j = i, Yij =\nif j = i.\nλi - λj\nThis shows that f induces an isomorphism f|U : U → Un, where Un is the subset of Cn\nconsisting of pairs (X, Y ) for which X has distinct eigenvalues.\nFrom this presentation, it is straigtforward that f ∗(Tr (Xp)) = xp\n1 +\n+ xp\nn for every\n· · ·\npositive integer p. Also, f commutes with the natural SL2(C)-action on Mc and Cn (by\n(X, Y )\n(aX + bY, cX + dY )), so we also get f ∗(Tr (Y p)) = y1\np +\n+ yn\np , and\n→\n· · ·\np\nm\np-m\nf ∗(Tr (XpY )) =\nxi yixi\n.\np + 1 m=0\ni\nNow, using the necklace bracket formula on Cn and the commutation relations of H0,c, we\nfind, by a direct computation, that f ∗ preserves Poisson bracket on the elements Tr (Xp),\nTr (XqY ). But these elements are a local coordinate system near a generic point, so it follows\nthat f is a Poisson map. Since the algebra B0,c is Poisson generated by\nxi\np and\nyi\np for\nall p, we get that f ∗ is a surjective map.\nAlso, f ∗ is injective. Indeed, by Wilson's theorem the Calogero-Moser space is connected,\nand hence the algebra O(Cn) has no zero divisors, while Cn has the same dimension as Mc.\nThis proves that f ∗ is an isomorphism, so f is an isomorphism.\n\n9.7. The Hilbert scheme Hilbn(C2) and the Calogero-Moser space. The Hilbert\nscheme Hilbn(C2) is defined to be\nHilbn(C2) = { ideals I ⊂ C[x, y]|codimI = n}\n= {(E, v)|E is a C[x, y]-module of dimension n, v is a cyclic vector of E}.\nThe second equality can be easily seen from the short exact sequence\nI\nC[x, y]\nE\n0.\n→\n→\n→\n→\n\nLet S(n)C2 = C2 × · · · × C2\n, where Sn acts by permutation. We have a natural map\n|\n{z\n} /Sn\nn times\nHilbn(C2)\nS(n)C2 which sends every ideal I to its zero set (with multiplicities). This map\n→\nis called the Hilbert-Chow map.\nTheorem 9.17 (Fogarty, [F]).\n(i) Hilbn(C2) is a smooth quasiprojective variety.\n(ii) The Hilbert-Chow map Hilbn(C2)\nS(n)C2 is projective. It is a resolution of singu\n→\nlarities.\nProof. Proof can be found in [Na].\n\nNow consider the Calogero-Moser space Cn defined in Section 9.2.\nTheorem 9.18 (see [Na]). The Hilbert Scheme Hilbn(C2) is Cinf-diffeomorphic to Cn.\nRemark 9.19. More precisely there exists a family of algebraic varieties over A1, say Xt,\nt ∈ A1, such that Xt is isomorphic to Cn if t = 0 and\nX0 is the Hilbert scheme; and also if we\ndenote by Xt the deformation of C2n/Sn into the Calogero-Moser space, then there exists\na map ft : Xt Xt, such that for t =6\n0, ft is an isomorphism and f0 is the Hilbert-Chow\nmap.\nRemark 9.20. Consider the action of G = PGLn on T ∗Matn. As we have discussed, the\ncorresponding moment map is μ(X, Y ) = [X, Y ], so μ-1(0) = {(X, Y )|[X, Y ] = 0} is the\ncommuting variety. We can consider two kinds of quotient μ-1(0)/G (i.e., of Hamiltonian\nreduction):\n(1) The categorical quotient, i.e.,\n= (Cn\nSpec(C[xij , yij]/h[X, Y ] = 0i)G ∼\n× Cn)/Sn.\nIt is a reduced (by Gan-Ginzburg Theorem 9.14), affine but singular variety.\n(2) The GIT quotient, in which the stability condition is that there exists a cyclic vector\nfor X, Y . This quotient is Hilbn(C2), which is smooth but not affine.\nBoth of these reductions are degenerations of the reduction along the orbit of matrices T\nsuch that T + 1 has rank 1, which yields the space Cn. This explains why Theorem 9.18 and\nthe results mentioned in Remark 9.19 are natural to expect.\n9.8. The cohomology of Cn. We also have the following result describing the cohomology\nof Cn (and hence, by Theorem 9.18, of Hilbn(C2)). Define the age filtration for the symmetric\ngroup Sn by setting\nage(transposition) = 1.\nThen one can show that for any σ ∈ Sn, age(σ) = rank (1 - σ)|reflection representation. It is easy\nto see that 0 ≤ age ≤ n-1. Notice also that the age filtration can be defined for any Coxeter\ngroup.\nTheorem 9.21 (Lehn-Sorger, Vasserot). The cohomology ring H∗(Cn, C) lives in even degrees\nonly and is isomorphic to gr(Center(C[Sn])) under the age filtration (with doubled degrees).\nProof. Let us sketch a noncommutative-algebraic proof of this theorem, given in [EG]. This\nproof is based on the following result.\n\nTheorem 9.22 (Nest-Tsygan, [NT]). If M is an affine symplectic variety and A is a quan\ntization of M, then\nHH∗(A[~-1], A[~-1]) ∼= H∗(M, C((~)))\nas an algebra over C((~)).\nNow, we know that the algebra Bt,c is a quantization of Cn. Therefore by above theorem,\nthe cohomology algebra of Cn is the cohomology of Bt,c (for generic t). But Bt,c is Morita\nequivalent to Ht,c, so this cohomology is the same as the Hochschild cohomology of Ht,c.\nHowever, the latter can be computed by using that Ht,c is given by generators and relations\n(by producing explicit representatives of cohomology classes and computing their product),\nwhich gives the result.\n\n9.9. Notes. Sections 9.1-9.6 follow Section 1, 2, 4 of [E4]; the parts about the Hilbert\nscheme and its relation to Calogero-Moser spaces follow the book [Na] (see also [GS]); the\nother parts follow the paper [EG].\n\nP\nP\nP\nQ\n10. Quantization of Claogero-Moser spaces\n10.1. Quantum moment maps and quantum Hamiltonian reduction. Now we would\nlike to quantize the notion of a moment map. Let g be a Lie algebra, and A be an associative\nalgebra equipped with a g-action, i.e. a Lie algebra map φ : g\nDerA. A quantum moment\n→\nmap for (A, φ) is an associative algebra homomorphism μ : U(g)\nA such that for any\n→\na ∈ g, b ∈ A one has [μ(a), b] = φ(a)b.\nThe space of g-invariants Ag, i.e. elements b ∈ A such that [μ(a), b] = 0 for all a ∈ g, is\na subalgebra of A. Let J ⊂ A be the left ideal generated by μ(a), a ∈ g. Then J is not\na 2-sided ideal, but Jg := J ∩ Ag is a 2-sided ideal in Ag. Indeed, let c ∈ Ag, and b ∈ Jg,\nb =\nbiμ(ai), bi ∈ A, ai ∈ g. Then bc =\nbiμ(ai)c =\nbicμ(ai) ∈ Jg.\ni\nThus, the algebra A//g := Ag/Jg is an associative algebra, which is called the quantum\nHamiltonian reduction of A with respect to the quantum moment map μ.\n10.2. The Levasseur-Stafford theorem. In general, similarly to the classical case, it is\nrather difficult to compute the quantum reduction A//g. For example, in this subsection\nwe will describe A//g in the case when A = D(g) is the algebra of differential operators\non a reductive Lie algebra g, and g acts on A through the adjoint action on itself. This\ndescription is a very nontrivial result of Levasseur and Stafford.\nLet h be a Cartan subalgebra of g, and W the Weyl group of (g, h). Let hreg denote the set\nof regular points in h, i.e. the complement of the reflection hyperplanes. To describe D(g)//g,\nwe will construct a homomorphism HC : D(g)g →D(h)W , called the Harish-Chandra homo\nmorphism (as it was first constructed by Harish-Chandra). Recall that we have the classical\nHarish-Chandra isomorphism ζ : C[g]g\nC[h]W , defined simply by restricting g-invariant\n→\nfunctions on g to the Cartan subalgebra h. Using this isomorphism, we can define an action\nof D(g)g on C[h]W , which is clearly given by W -invariant differential operators. However,\nthese operators will, in general, have poles on the reflection hyperplanes. Thus we get a\nhomomorphism HC0 : D(g)g →D(hreg)W .\nThe homomorphism HC0 is called the radial part homomorphism, as for example for\ng = su(2) it computes the radial parts of rotationally invariant differential operators on R3\nin spherical coordinates. This homomorphism is not yet what we want, since it does not\nactually land in D(h)W (the radial parts have poles).\nThus we define the Harish-Chandra homomorphism by twisting HC0 by the discriminant\nδ(x) =\n(α, x) (x ∈ h, and α runs over positive roots of g):\nα>0\nHC(D) := δ * HC0(D) * δ-1 ∈D(hreg)W .\nTheorem 10.1.\n(i) (Harish-Chandra, [HC]) For any reductive g, HC lands in D(h)W ⊂\nD(hreg)W .\n(ii) (Levasseur-Stafford [LS]) The homomorphism HC defines an isomorphism D(g)//g =\nD(h)W .\nRemark 10.2.\n(1) Part (i) of the theorem says that the poles magically disappear after\nconjugation by δ.\n(2) Both parts of this theorem are quite nontrivial. The first part was proved by Harish-\nChandra using analytic methods, and the second part by Levasseur and Stafford\nusing the theory of D-modules.\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n|\nX\nP\nIn the case g = gln, Theorem 10.1 is a quantum analog of Theorem 9.14. The remaining\npart of this subsection is devoted to the proof of Theorem 10.1 in this special case, using\nTheorem 9.14.\nWe start the proof with the following proposition, valid for any reductive Lie algebra.\nProposition 10.3. If D ∈ (Sg)g is a differential operator with constant coefficients, then\nHC(D) is the W -invariant differential operator with constant coefficients on h, obtained from\nD via the classical Harish-Chandra isomorphism η : (Sg)g\n(Sh)W .\n→\nProof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that g is simple.\nLemma 10.4. Let D be the Laplacian Δg of g, corresponding to an invariant form. Then\nHC(D) is the Laplacian Δh.\nProof. Let us calculate HC0(D). We have\nr\nD =\n∂x\ni + 2\n∂fα ∂eα ,\ni=1\nα>0\nwhere xi is an orthonormal basis of h, and eα, fα are root elements such that (eα, fα) = 1.\nThus if F (x) is a g-invariant function on g, then we get\nr\n(DF ) h =\n∂x\ni (F h) + 2\n(∂fα ∂eα F ) h.\n|\ni=1\n|\nα>0\n|\nNow let x ∈ h, and consider (∂fα ∂eα F )(x). We have\n(∂fα ∂eα F )(x) = ∂s∂t|s=t=0F (x + tfα + seα).\nOn the other hand, we have\nAd(e sα(x)-1eα )(x + tfα + seα) = x + tfα + tsα(x)-1hα + · · · ,\nwhere hα = [eα, fα]. Hence, ∂s∂t s=t=0F (x +tfα +seα) = α(x)-1(∂hα F )(x). This implies that\nHC0(D)F (x) = ΔhF (x) + 2\nα(x)-1∂hα F (x).\nα>0\nNow the statement of the Lemma reduces to the identity δ-1 *Δh*δ = Δh+2\nα>0 α(x)-1∂hα .\nThis identity follows immediately from the identity Δhδ = 0. To prove the latter, it suffices\nto note that δ is the lowest degree nonzero polynomial on h, which is antisymmetric under\nthe action of W . The lemma is proved.\n\nNow let D be any element of (Sg)g ⊂D(g)g of degree d (operator with constant coeffi\ncients). It is obvious that the leading order part of the operator HC(D) is the operator η(D)\nwith constant coefficients, whose symbol is just the restriction of the symbol of D from g∗\nto h∗. Our job is to show that in fact HC(D) = η(D). To do so, denote by Y the difference\nHC(D) - η(D). Assume Y = 0. By Lemma 10.4, the operator HC(\nD) commutes with Δh.\nTherefore, so does Y . Also Y has homogeneity degree d but order m ≤ d - 1. Let S(x, p) be\nthe symbol of Y (x ∈ h, p ∈ h∗). Then S is a homogeneous function of homogeneity degree\nd under the transformations x\nt-1x, p\ntp, polynomial in p of degree m. From these\n→\n→\nproperties of S it is clear that S is not a polynomial (its degree in x is m - d < 0). On\nthe other hand, since Y commutes with Δh, the Poisson bracket of S with p2 is zero. Thus\nProposition 10.3 follows from Lemma 2.22.\n\nP\nP\nP\nZ\nNow we continue the proof of Theorem 10.1. Consider the filtration on D(g) in which\ndeg(g) = 1 deg(g∗) = 0 (the order filtration), and the associated graded map grHC : C[g ×\ng∗]g → C[hreg × h∗]W , which attaches to every differential operator the symbol of its radial\npart. It is easy to see that this map is just the restriction map to h ⊕ h∗ ⊂ g ⊕ g∗, so it\nactually lands in C[h ⊕ h∗]W .\nMoreover, grHC is a map onto C[h ⊕ h∗]W . Indeed, grHC is a Poisson map, so the\nsurjectivity follows from the following Lemma.\nLemma 10.5. C[h ⊕ h∗]W is generated as a Poisson algebra by C[h]W and C[h∗]W , i.e. by\nfunctions fm =\nxm and f ∗ =\npm\ni\nm\ni , m ≥ 1.\nr-1 m-1\nProof. We have {fm\n∗ , fr} = mr\nx\npi\n. Thus the result follows from Corollary 9.13.\ni\nLet K0 be the kernel of grHC. Then by Theorem 9.14, K0 is the ideal of the commuting\nscheme Comm(g)/G.\nNow consider the kernel K of the homomorphism HC. It is easy to see that K ⊃ Jg,\nso gr(K) ⊃ gr(J)g. On the other hand, since K0 is the ideal of the commuting scheme,\nwe clearly have gr(J)g ⊃ K0, and K0 ⊃ grK. This implies that K0 = grK = gr(J)g, and\nK = Jg.\nIt remains to show that Im HC = D(h)W . Since grK = K0, we have grIm HC = C[h⊕h∗]W .\nTherefore, to finish the proof of the Harish-Chandra and Levasseur-Stafford theorems, it\nsuffices to prove the following proposition.\nProposition 10.6. Im HC ⊃D(h)W .\nProof. We will use the following Lemma.\nLemma 10.7 (N. Wallach, [Wa]). D(h)W is generated as an algebra by W -invariant func\ntions and W -invariant differential operators with constant coefficients.\nProof. The lemma follows by taking associated graded algebras from Lemma 10.5.\n\nRemark 10.8. Levasseur and Stafford showed [LS] that this lemma is valid for any finite\ngroup W acting on a finite dimensional vector space h. However, the above proof does not\napply, since, as explained in [Wa], Lemma 10.5 fails for many groups W , including Weyl\ngroups of exceptional Lie algebras E6, E7, E8 (in fact it even fails for the cyclic group of\norder > 2 acting on a 1-dimensional space!). The general proof is more complicated and uses\nsome results in noncommutative algebra.\nLemma 10.7 and Proposition 10.3 imply Proposition 10.6.\n\nThus, Theorem 10.1 is proved.\n10.3. Corollaries of Theorem 10.1. Let gR be the compact form of g, and O a regular\ncoadjoint orbit in g∗ Consider the map\nR.\nψO : h → C,\nψO(x) =\nO\ne(b,x)db, x ∈ h,\nwhere db is the measure on the orbit coming from the Kirillov-Kostant symplectic structure.\n\nX\nZ\nQ\nTheorem 10.9 (Harish-Chandra formula). For a regular element x ∈ h, we have\nψO(x) = δ-1(x)\n(-1)`(w)e(wλ,x),\nw∈W\nwhere λ is the intersection of O with the dominant chamber in the dual Cartan subalgebra\nh∗\nR, and `(w) is the length of an element w ∈ W .\nR ⊂ g∗\nProof. Take D ∈ (Sg)g. Then δ(x)ψO is an eigenfunction of HC(D) = η(D) ∈ (Sh)W with\neigenvalue χO(D), where χO(D) is the value of the invariant polynomial D at the orbit O.\nSince the solutions of the equation η(D)φ = χO(D)φ have a basis e(wλ,x) where w ∈ W ,\nwe have\nX\nδ(x)ψO(x) =\ncw · e(wλ,x).\nw∈W\nSince it is antisymmetric, we have cw = c (-1)`(w), where c is a constant. The fact that\n·\nc = 1 can be shown by comparing the asymptotics of both sides as x →inf in the regular\nchamber (using the stationary phase approximation for the integral).\n\nFrom Theorem 10.9 and the Weyl Character formula, we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 10.10 (Kirillov character formula for finite dimensional representations, [Ki]). If\nλ is a dominant integral weight, and Lλ is the corresponding representation of G, then\nTr Lλ (e x) = δ(x)\ne(b,x)db,\nδTr (x)\nOλ+ρ\nwhere δTr (x) is the trigonometric version of δ(x), i.e.\nthe Weyl denominator\n(eα(x)/2 - e-α(x)/2), and Oμ denotes the coadjoint orbit passing through μ.\nα>0\n10.4. The deformed Harish-Chandra homomorphism. Finally, we would like to ex\nplain how to quantize the Calogero-Moser space Cn, using the procedure of quantum Hamil\ntonian reduction.\nLet g = gln, A = D(g) as above. Let k be a complex number, and Wk be the representation\nof sln on the space of functions of the form (x1 · · · xn)kf(x1, . . . , xn), where f is a Laurent\npolynomial of degree 0. We regard Wk as a g-module by pulling it back to g under the\nnatural projection g\nsln. Let Ik be the annihilator of Wk in U(g). The ideal Ik is the\n→\nquantum counterpart of the coadjoint orbit of matrices T such that T + 1 has rank 1.\nLet Bk = D(g)g/(D(g)μ(Ik))g where μ : U(g)\nA is the quantum momentum map (the\n→\nquantum Hamiltonian reduction with respect to the ideal Ik). Then Bk has a filtration\ninduced from the order filtration of D(g)g.\nLet HCk : D(g)g → Bk be the natural homomorphism, and K(k) be the kernel of HCk.\nTheorem 10.11 (Etingof-Ginzburg, [EG]).\n(i) K(0) = K, B0 = D(h)W , HC0 = HC.\n(ii) grK(k) = Ker (grHCk) = K0 for all complex k. Thus, HCk is a flat family of\nhomomorphisms.\n(iii) The algebra grBk is commutative and isomorphic to C[h ⊕ h∗]W as a Poisson algebra.\nBecause of this theorem, the homomorphism HCk is called the deformed Harish-Chandra\nhomomorphism.\nTheorem 10.11 implies that Bk is a quantization of the Calogero-Moser space Cn (with\ndeformation parameter 1/k). But we already know one such quantization - the spherical\n\nCherednik algebra B1,k for the symmetric group. Therefore, the following theorem comes as\nno surprize.\nTheorem 10.12 ([EG]). The algebra Bk is isomorphic to the spherical rational Cherednik\nalgebra B1,k(Sn, Cn).\nThus, quantum Hamiltonian reduction provides a Lie-theoretic construction of the spher\nical rational Cherednik algebra for the symmetric group. A similar (but more complicated)\nLie theoretic construction exists for symplectic reflection algebras for wreath product groups\ndefined in Example 8.5 (see [EGGO]).\n10.5. Notes.

      "content": "1. Introduction\nDouble affine Hecke algebras, also called Cherednik algebras, were introduced by Chered\nnik in 1993 as a tool in his proof of Macdonald's conjectures about orthogonal polynomials for\nroot systems. Since then, it has been realized that Cherednik algebras are of great indepen\ndent interest; they appeared in many different mathematical contexts and found numerous\napplications.\nThe present notes are based on a course on Cherednik algebras given by the first author\nat MIT in the Fall of 2009. Their goal is to give an introduction to Cherednik algebras, and\nto review the web of connections between them and other mathematical objects. For this\nreason, the notes consist of many parts that are relatively independent of each other. Also,\nto keep the notes within the bounds of a one-semester course, we had to limit the discussion\nof many important topics to a very brief outline, or to skip them altogether. For a more\nin-depth discussion of Cherednik algebras, we refer the reader to research articles dedicated\nto this subject.\nThe notes do not contain any original material. In each section, the sources of the expo\nsition are listed in the notes at the end of the section.\nThe organization of the notes is as follows.\nIn Section 2, we define the classical and quantum Calogero-Moser systems, and their\nanalogs for any Coxeter groups introduced by Olshanetsky and Perelomov. Then we intro\nduce Dunkl operators, prove the fundamental result of their commutativity, and use them to\nestablish integrability of the Calogero-Moser and Olshanetsky-Perelomov systems. We also\nprove the uniqueness of the first integrals for these systems.\nIn Section 3, we conceptualize the commutation relations between Dunkl operators and\ncoordinate operators by introducing the main object of these notes - the rational Cherednik\nalgebra. We develop the basic theory of rational Cherednik algebras (proving the PBW\ntheorem), and then pass to the representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras, more\nprecisely, study the structure of category O. After developing the basic theory (parallel to\nthe case of semisimple Lie algebras), we completely work out the representations in the rank\n1 case, and prove a number of results about finite dimensional representations and about\nrepresentations of the rational Cherednik algebra attached to the symmetric group.\nIn Section 4, we evaluate the Macdonald-Mehta integral, and then use it to find the sup\nports of irrieducible modules over the rational Cherednik algebras with the trivial lowest\nweight, in particular giving a simple proof of the theorem of Varagnolo and Vasserot, classi\nfying such representations which are finite dimensional.\nIn Section 5, we describe the theory of parabolic induction and restriction functors for\nrational Cherednik algebras, developed in [BE], and give some applications of this theory,\nsuch as the description of the category of Whittaker modules and of possible supports of\nmodules lying in category O.\nIn Section 6, we define Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups, and the Knizhnik-\nZamolodchikov (KZ) functor from the category O of a rational Cherednik algebra to the\ncategory of finite dimensional representations of the corresponding Hecke algebra. We use\nthis functor to prove the formal flatness of Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups (a\ntheorem of Brou e, Malle, and Rouquier), and state the theorem of Ginzburg-Guay-Opdam-\nRouquier that the KZ functor is an equivalence from the category O modulo its torsion part\nto the category of representations of the Hecke algebra.\n\nIn Section 7, we define rational Cherednik algebras for orbifolds. We also define the\ncorresponding Hecke algebras, and define the KZ functor from the category of modules over\nthe former to that over the latter. This generalizes to the \"curved\" case the KZ functor\nfor rational Cherednik algebras of complex reflection groups, defined in Section 6. We then\napply the KZ functor to showing that if the universal cover of the orbifold in question has\na trivial H2 (with complex coefficients), then the orbifold Hecke algebra is formally flat,\nand explain why the condition of trivial H2 cannot be dropped. Next, we list examples of\norbifold Hecke algebras which satisfy the condition of vanishing H2 (and hence are formally\nflat). These include usual, affine, and double affine Hecke algebras, as well as Hecke algebras\nattached to Fuchsian groups, which include quantizations of del Pezzo surfaces and their\nHilbert schemes; we work these examples out in some detail, highlighting connections with\nother subjects. Finally, we discuss the issue of algebraic flatness, and prove it in the case of\nalgebras of rank 1 attached to Fuchsian groups, using the theory of deformations of group\nalgebras of Coxeter groups developed in [ER].\nIn Section 8, we define symplectic reflection algebras (which inlude rational Cherednik al\ngebras as a special case), and generalize to them some of the theory of Section 3. Namely, we\nuse the theory of deformations of Koszul algebras to prove the PBW theorem for symplectic\nreflection algebras. We also determine the center of symplectic reflection algebras, showing\nthat it is trivial when the parameter t is nonzero, and is isomorphic to the shperical subal\ngebra if t = 0. Next, we give a deformation-theoretic interpretation of symplectic reflection\nalgebras as universal deformations of Weyl algebras smashed with finite groups. Finally, we\ndiscuss finite dimensional representations of symplectic reflection algebras for t = 0, show\ning that the Azumaya locus on the space of such representations coincides with the smooth\nlocus. This uses the theory of Cohen-Macaulay modules and of homological dimension in\ncommutative algebra. In particular, we show that for Cherednik algebras of type An-1, the\nwhole representation space is smooth and coincides with the spectrum of the center.\nIn Section 9, we give another description of the spectrum of the center of the rational\nCherednik algebra of type An-1 (for t = 0), as a certain space of conjugacy classes of pairs\nof matrices, introduced by Kazhdan, Kostant, and Sternberg, and called the Calogero-Moser\nspace (this space is obtained by classical hamiltonian reduction, and is a special case of a\nquiver variety). This yields a new construction of the Calogero-Moser integrable system.\nWe also sketch a proof of the Gan-Ginzburg theorem claiming that the quotient of the\ncommuting scheme by conjugation is reduced, and hence isomorphic to C2n/Sn. Finally, we\nexplain that the Calogero-Moser space is a topologically trivial deformation of the Hilbert\nscheme of the plane, we use the theory of Cherednik algebras to compute the cohomology\nring of this space.\nIn Section 10, we generalize the results of Section 9 to the quantum case. Namely, we\nprove the quantum analog of the Gan-Ginzburg theorem (the Harish Chandra-Levasseur-\nStafford theorem), and explain how to quantize the Calogero-Moser space using quantum\nHamiltonian reduction. Not surprisingly, this gives the same quantization as was constructed\nin the previous sections, namely, the spherical subalgebra of the rational Cherednik algebra.\nAcknowledgements.

      "content": "2. Classical and quantum Olshanetsky-Perelomov systems for finite\nCoxeter groups\n2.1. The rational quantum Calogero-Moser system. Consider the differential operator\nn\nX ∂2\nX\nH =\ni=1 ∂xi\n2 - c(c + 1)\ni=\nj (xi - xj )2 .\nThis is the quantum Hamiltonian for a system of n particles on the line of unit mass and the\ninteraction potential (between particle 1 and 2) c(c + 1)/(x1 - x2)2 . This system is called\nthe rational quantum Calogero-Moser system.\nIt turns out that the rational quantum Calogero-Moser system is completely integrable.\nNamely, we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 2.1. There exist differential operators Lj with rational coefficients of the form\nn\nX ∂\nLj =\n(\n)j + lower order terms,\nj = 1, . . . , n,\n∂xi\ni=1\nwhich are invariant under the symmetric group Sn, homogeneous of degree -j, and such\nthat L2 = H and [Lj , Lk] = 0, ∀j, k = 1, . . . , n.\nWe will prove this theorem later.\nP ∂\nRemark 2.2. L1 =\ni\n.\n∂xi\n2.2. Complex reflection groups. Theorem 2.1 can be generalized to the case of any finite\nCoxeter group. To describe this generalization, let us recall the basic theory of finite Coxeter\ngroups and, more generally, complex reflection groups.\nLet h be a finite-dimensional complex vector space. We say that a semisimple element\ns ∈ GL(h) is a (complex) reflection if rank (1 - s) = 1. This means that s is conjugate to\nthe diagonal matrix diag(λ, 1, . . . , 1) where λ = 1.\nNow assume h carries a nondegenerate inner product (·, ). We say that a semisimple\n·\nelement s ∈ O(h) is a real reflection if rank (1 - s) = 1; equivalently, s is conjugate to\ndiag(-1, 1, . . . , 1).\nNow let G ⊂ GL(h) be a finite subgroup.\nDefinition 2.3.\n(i) We say that G is a complex reflection group if it is generated by\ncomplex reflections.\n(ii) If h carries an inner product, then a finite subgroup G ⊂ O(h) is a real reflection\ngroup (or a finite Coxeter group) if G is generated by real reflections.\nFor the complex reflection groups, we have the following important theorem.\nTheorem 2.4 (The Chevalley-Shepard-Todd theorem, [Che]). A finite subgroup G of GL(h)\nis a complex reflection group if and only if the algebra (Sh)G is a polynomial (i.e., free)\nalgebra.\nBy the Chevalley-Shepard-Todd theorem, the algebra (Sh)G has algebraically independent\ngenerators Pi, homogeneous of some degrees di for i = 1, . . . , dim h. The numbers di are\nuniquely determined, and are called the degrees of G.\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nX\ni\nExample 2.5. If G = Sn, h = Cn-1 (the space of vectors in Cn with zero sum of co\nordinates), then one can take Pi(p1, . . . , pn) = p i+1 +\n+ pi+1 , i = 1, . . . , n - 1 (where\nP\nn\n· · ·\npi = 0).\n2.3. Parabolic subgroups. Let G ⊂ GL(h) be a finite subgroup.\nDefinition 2.6. A parabolic subgroup of G is the stabilizer Ga of a point a ∈ h.\nNote that by Chevalley's theorem, a parabolic subgroup of a complex (respectively, real)\nreflection group is itself a complex (respectively, real) reflection group.\nAlso, if W is a real reflection group, then it can be shown that a subgroup W 0 ⊂ W is\nparabolic if and only if it is conjugate to a subgroup generated by a subset of simple reflections\nof W . In this case, the rank of W 0, i.e. the number of generating simple reflections, equals\nthe codimension of the space hW 0 .\nExample 2.7. Consider the Coxeter group of type E8. It has the Dynkin diagram:\n-\nThe parabolic subgroups will be Coxeter groups whose Dynkin diagrams are obtained by\ndeleting vertices from the above graph. In particular, the maximal parabolic subgroups are\nD7, A7, A1 × A6, A2 × A1 × A4, A4 × A3, D5 × A2, E6 × A1, E7.\nSuppose G0 ⊂ G is a parabolic subgroup, and b ∈ h is such that Gb = G0. In this case,\nwe have a natural G0-invariant decomposition h = hG0 ⊕ (h∗G0 )⊥, and b ∈ hG0 . Thus we have\na nonempty open set hG0 of all a ∈ hG0 for which Ga = G0; this set is nonempty because it\nreg\ncontains b. We also have a G0-invariant decomposition h∗ = h∗G0 ⊕ (hG0 )⊥, and we can define\nthe open set h∗G0 of all λ ∈ hG0 for which Gλ = G0. It is clear that this set is nonempty. This\nreg\nimplies, in particular, that one can make an alternative definition of a parabolic subgroup\nof G as the stabilizer of a point in h∗.\n2.4. Olshanetsky-Perelomov operators. Let s ⊂ GL(h) be a complex reflection. Denote\nby αs ∈ h∗ an eigenvector in h∗ of s with nontrivial eigenvalue.\nLet W ⊂ O(h) be a real reflection group and S ⊂ W the set of reflections. Clearly, W\nacts on S by conjugation. Let c : S → C be a conjugation invariant function.\nDefinition 2.8. [OP] The quantum Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonian attached to W is\nthe second order differential operator\nH := Δh -\ns∈S\n(cs\ncs\n+ 1)(αs,\nα2\ns\nαs) ,\nwhere Δh is the Laplace operator on h.\nHere we use the inner product on h∗ which is dual to the inner product on h.\nLet us assume that h is an irreducible representation of W (i.e. W is an irreducible finite\nCoxeter group, and h is its reflection representation.) In this case, we can take P1(p) = p2 .\nTheorem 2.9. The system defined by the Olshanetsky-Perelomov operator H is completely\nintegrable. Namely, there exist differential operators Lj on h with rational coefficients and\nsymbols Pj , such that Lj are homogeneous (of degree -dj ), L1 = H, and [Lj , Lk] = 0, ∀j, k.\n\nX\nThis theorem is obviously a generalization of Theorem 2.1 about W = Sn.\nTo prove Theorem 2.9, one needs to develop the theory of Dunkl operators.\nRemark 2.10. 1. We will show later that the operators Lj are unique.\n2. Theorem 2.9 for classical root systems was proved by Olshanetsky and Perelomov\n(see [OP]), following earlier work of Calogero, Sutherland, and Moser in type A. For a\ngeneral Weyl group, this theorem (in fact, its stronger trigonometric version) was proved by\nanalytic methods in the series of papers [HO],[He3],[Op3],[Op4]. A few years later, a simple\nalgebraic proof using Dunkl operators, which works for any finite Coxeter group, was found\nby Heckman, [He1]; this is the proof we will give below.\nFor the trigonometric version, Heckman also gave an algebraic proof in [He2], which used\nnon-commuting trigonometric counterparts of Dunkl operators. This proof was later im\nproved by Cherednik ([Ch1]), who defined commuting (although not Weyl group invariant)\nversions of Heckman's trigonometric Dunkl operators, now called Dunkl-Cherednik opera\ntors.\n2.5. Dunkl operators. Let G ⊂ GL(h) be a finite subgroup. Let S be the set of reflections\nin G. For any reflection s ∈S, let λs be the eigenvalue of s on αs ∈ h∗ (i.e. sαs = λsαs),\nand let α∨∈ h be an eigenvector such that sα∨= λ-1α∨. We normalize them in such a way\ns\ns\ns\ns\nthat hαs, α∨\ns i = 2.\nLet c : S → C be a function invariant with respect to conjugation. Let a ∈ h.\nThe following definition was made by Dunkl for real reflection groups, and by Dunkl and\nOpdam for complex reflection groups.\nDefinition 2.11. The Dunkl operator Da = Da(c) on C(h) is defined by the formula\nX 2csαs(a)\nDa = Da(c) := ∂a -\n(1 - λs)αs\n(1 - s).\ns∈S\nClearly, Da ∈ CG n D(hreg), where hreg is the set of regular points of h (i.e. not preserved\nby any reflection), and D(hreg) denotes the algebra of differential operators on hreg.\nExample 2.12. Let G = Z2, h = C. Then there is only one Dunkl operator up to scaling,\nand it equals to\nc\nD = ∂x - (1 - s),\nx\nwhere the operator s is given by the formula (sf)(x) = f(-x).\nRemark 2.13. The Dunkl operators Da map the space of polynomials C[h] to itself.\nProposition 2.14.\n(i) For any x ∈ h∗, one has\n[Da, x] = (a, x) -\ncs(a, αs)(x, α∨)s.\ns\ns∈S\n(ii) If g ∈ G then gDag-1 = Dga.\nProof. (i) The proof follows immediately from the identity\nx - sx = 1 - λs (x, α∨)αs.\ns\n(ii) The identity is obvious from the invariance of the function c.\n\nX\nP\nX\nThe main result about Dunkl operators, on which all their applications are based, is the\nfollowing theorem.\nTheorem 2.15 (C. Dunkl, [Du1]). The Dunkl operators commute:\n[Da, Db] = 0 for any a, b ∈ h.\nProof. Let x ∈ h∗. We have\n[[Da, Db], x] = [[Da, x], Db] - [[Db, x], Da].\nNow, using Proposition 2.14, we obtain:\n[[Da, x], Db]\n= -[\ncs(a, αs)(x, α∨\ns )s, Db]\ns∈S\n= -\nX\ncs(a, αs)(x, αs\n∨)(b, αs)sDα∨\ns · 1 -\nλ-\ns\n.\ns∈S\nSince a and b occur symmetrically, we obtain that [[Da, Db], x] = 0. This means that for any\nf\nf ∈ C[h], [Da, Db]f = f[Da, Db]1 = 0. So for f, g ∈ C[h], g ·[Da, Db] g = [Da, Db]f = 0. Thus\nf\n[Da, Db]\n= 0 which implies [Da, Db] = 0 in the algebra CG n D(hreg) (since this algebra\ng\nacts faithfully on C(h)).\n\n2.6. Proof of Theorem 2.9. For any element B ∈ CW n D(hreg), define m(B) to be the\ndifferential operator C(h)W\nC(h), defined by B. That is, if B =\n),\nP\n→\ng∈W Bgg, Bg ∈D(hreg\nthen m(B) =\ng∈W Bg. It is clear that if B is W -invariant, then ∀A ∈ CW n D(hreg),\nm(AB) = m(A)m(B).\nProposition 2.16 ([Du1], [He1]). Let {y1, . . . , yr} be an orthonormal basis of h. Then we\nhave\nr\nm(\nDy\ni ) = H,\ni=1\nP\ncs(αs, αs)\nwhere H = Δh -\n∂α∨.\ns\ns∈S\nαs\nProof. For any y ∈ h, we have m(Dy\n2) = m(Dy∂y). A simple computation shows that\nDy∂y = ∂y\n2 -\nX csα\nα\ns\ns\n(y)(1 - s)∂y\ns∈S\n= ∂y\n2 -\nX csαs(y)(∂y(1 - s) + αs(y)∂α∨s).\nαs\ns\ns∈S\nThis means that\nm(Dy\n2) = ∂y\n2 -\nX csα\nα\ns(\ns\ny)2\n∂α∨.\ns\ns∈S\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nQ\nQ\nSo we get\nm(\nr\nDy\ni ) =\nr\n∂y\ni -\ncs\nr\nαs\nα\n(y\ns\ni)2\n∂αs∨= H,\nP\ni=1\ni=1\ns∈S\ni=1\nsince\nr\ni=1 αs(yi)2 = (αs, αs).\n\nRecall that by the Chevalley-Shepard-Todd theorem, the algebra (Sh)W is free. Let P1 =\np2, P2, . . . , Pr be homogeneous generators of (Sh)W .\nCorollary 2.17. The differential operators Lj = m(Pj (Dy1 , . . . , Dyr )) are pairwise commu\ntative, have symbols Pj , homogeneity degree -dj , and L1 = H.\nProof. Since Dunkl operators commute, the operators Lj are well defined. Since m(AB) =\nm(A)m(B) when B is invariant, the operators Lj are pairwise commutative. The rest is\nclear.\n\nNow to prove Theorem 2.9, we will show that the operators H and H are conjugate to\neach other by a certain function; this will complete the proof.\nProposition 2.18. Let δc(x) :=\nαs(x)cs . Then we have\ns∈S\nδ-1\nH\nδc = H.\nc *\n*\nRemark 2.19. The function δc(x) is not rational. It is a multivalued analytic function.\nNevertheless, it is easy to see that for any differential operator L with rational coefficients,\nδc\n-1\nL\nδc also has rational coefficients.\n*\n*\nProof of Proposition 2.18. We have\nr\nX\nX cs(αs, αs)\n∂yi (log δc)∂yi =\ns .\n∂α∨\n2αs\ni=1\ns∈S\nTherefore, we have\nδc * H\nδc\n-1 = Δh -\nX cs(αs, αs)\ns + U,\n*\nαs\n∂α∨\ns∈S\nwhere\nU = δc(Δhδ-1\nX cs(cs + 1)(αs, αs) .\nc ) -\nα2\ns∈S\ns\nLet us compute U. We have\nX cs(cs + 1)(αs, αs)\nX cscu(αs, αu)\nδc(Δhδc\n-1) =\nα2\n+\n.\ns\nαsαu\ns∈S\ns6=u∈S\nWe claim that the last sum Σ is actually zero. Indeed, this sum is invariant under the Coxeter\ngroup, so\ns∈S αs · Σ is a regular anti-invariant function of degree |S| - 2. But the smallest\ndegree of a nonzero anti-invariant is |S|, so Σ = 0, U = 0, and we are done (Proposition 2.18\nand Theorem 2.9 are proved).\n\nRemark 2.20. A similar method works for any complex reflection group G. Namely, the\noperators Li = m(Pi(Dy1 , . . . , Dyr )) form a quantum integrable system. However, if G is not\na real reflection group, this system does not have a quadratic Hamiltonian in momentum\nvariables (so it does not have a physical meaning).\n\n2.7. Uniqueness of the operators Lj.\nProposition 2.21. The operators Lj are unique.\nProof. Assume that we have two choices for Lj : Lj and L0\nj. Denote Lj - L0\nj by M.\nAssume M = 0. We have\n(i) M is a differential operator on h with rational coefficients, of order smaller than dj\nand homogeneity degree -dj ;\n(ii) [M, H] = 0.\nLet M0 be the symbol of M. Then M0 is a polynomial of p ∈ h∗ with coefficients in C(h).\nWe have, from (ii),\n{M0, p 2} = 0,\n∀p ∈ h∗,\nand from (i) we see that the coefficients of M0 are not polynomial (as they have negative\ndegree).\nHowever, we have the following lemma.\nLemma 2.22. Let h be a finite dimensional vector space. Let ψ : (x, p) 7→ ψ(x, p) be a\nrational function on h ⊕ h∗ which is a polynomial in p ∈ h∗. Let f : h∗ → C be a polynomial\nsuch that the differentials df(p) for p ∈ h∗ span h (e.g., f(p) = p2). Suppose that the\nPoisson bracket of f and ψ vanishes: {ψ, f} = 0. Then ψ is a polynomial.\nProof. (R. Raj) Let Z ⊂ h be the pole divisor of ψ. Let x0 ∈ h be a generic point in Z. Then\nψ-1 is regular and vanishes at (x0, p) for generic p ∈ h∗. Also from {ψ-1, f} = 0, we have\nψ-1 vanishes along the entire flowline of the Hamiltonian flow defined by f and starting at\nx0. This flowline is defined by the formula\nx(t) = x0 + tdf(p),\np(t) = p,\nand it must be contained in the pole divisor of ψ near x0. This implies that df(p) must be\nin Tx0 Z for almost every, hence for every p ∈ h∗. This is a contradiction with the assumption\non f, which implies that in fact ψ has no poles.\n\n2.8. Classical Dunkl operators and Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonians. We con\ntinue to use the notations in Section 2.4.\nDefinition 2.23. The classical Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonian corresponding to W is\nthe following classical Hamiltonian on hreg × h∗ = T ∗hreg:\nX c2(αs, αs)\nH0(x, p) = p 2 -\ns\nα2(x) .\ns∈S\ns\nTheorem 2.24 ([OP],[HO, He3, Op3, Op4],[He1]). The Hamiltonian H0 defines a classical\nintegrable system. Namely, there exist unique regular functions L0 on hreg ×h∗, where highest\nj\nterms in p are Pj , such that L0 are homogeneous of degree -dj (under x 7→ λx, x ∈ h∗, p 7→\nj\nλ-1p, p ∈ h), and such that L0 = H0 and {L0\nj , Lk\n0 } = 0, ∀j, k.\nProof. The proof is given in the next subsection.\n\nX\nX\nP\nP\nX\nExample 2.25. Let W = Sn, h = Cn-1 .

Rees algebras. Let A be a filtered algebra over a field k: k = F 0A ⊂ F 1A ⊂ · · · ,\n∪iF iA = A. Then the Rees algebra A = Rees(A) is defined by the formula A = ⊕inf\nn=0F nA.\nThis is an algebra over k[~], where ~ is the element 1 of the summand F 1A.\n2.10. Proof of Theorem 2.24. The proof of Theorem 2.24 is similar to the proof of its\nquantum analog. Namely, to construct the functions Lj\n0 , we need to introduce classical\nDunkl operators. To do so, we introduce a parameter ~ (Planck's constant) and define\nDunkl operators Da(~) = Da(c, ~) with ~:\nDa(c, ~) = ~Da(c/~) = ~∂a -\nX\n(1\n2c\n-\nsα\nλ\ns\ns\n(\n)\na\nα\n)\ns\n(1 - s), where a ∈ h.\ns∈S\nThese operators can be regarded as elements of the Rees algebra A = Rees(CW n D(hreg)),\nwhere the filtration is by order of differential operators (and W sits in degree 0). Reducing\nthese operators modulo ~, we get classical Dunkl operators Da\n0(c) ∈ A0 := A/~A = CW n\nO(T ∗hreg). They are given by the formula\nD0(c) = pa -\nX\n(1\n2c\n-\nsα\nλ\ns\ns\n(\n)\na\nα\n)\ns\n(1 - s),\na\ns∈S\nwhere pa is the classical momentum (the linear function on h∗ corresponding to a ∈ h).\nIt follows from the commutativity of the quantum Dunkl operators Da(c) that the Dunkl\noperators Da(c, ~) commute. Hence, so do the classical Dunkl operators Da\n0:\n[Da\n0, Db\n0] = 0.\nWe also have the following analog of Proposition 2.14:\nProposition 2.26.\n(i) For any x ∈ h∗, one has\n[Da\n0 , x] = -\ncs(a, αs)(x, αs\n∨)s.\ns∈S\n(ii) If g ∈ W then gD0g-1 = D0 .\na\nga\nNow let us construct the classical Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonians. As in the quan\ntum case, we have the operation m(·), which is given by the formula\ng∈W Bg · g 7→\nBg,\nB ∈O(T ∗hreg). We define the Hamiltonian\nr\nH0 := m(\n(Dy\ni )2).\ni=1\n\nBy taking the limit of quantum situation, we find\nX cs(αs, αs)\n= p\n.\nH0\n2 -\nαs(x) pα∨\ns\ns∈S\nUnfortunately, this is no longer conjugate to H0. However, consider the (outer) automor\nphism θc of the algebra CW n O(T ∗hreg) defined by the formulas\nθc(x) = x, θc(s) = s, θc(pa) = pa + ∂a log δc,\nfor x ∈ h∗, a ∈ h, s ∈ W . It is easy to see that if b0 ∈ A0 and b ∈ A is a deformation of\nb0 then θc(b0) = lim~\nc/~bδc/~. Therefore, taking the limit ~\n0 in Proposition 2.16, we\n0 δ-1\n→\n→\nfind that H0 = θc(H0).\nNow set Lj\n0 = m(θc(Pj (Dy\n1 , . . . , Dy\nr ))). These functions are well defined since Da\n0 com\nmute, are homogeneous of degree zero, and L0\n1 = H0.\nMoreover, we can define the operators Lj (~) in Rees(D(hreg)W ) in the same way as Lj , but\nusing the Dunkl operators Dyi (~) instead of Dyi . Then [Lj (~), Lk(~)] = 0, and Lj (~) ~=0 =\nL0\nj . This implies that L0 Poisson commute: {L0, Lk\n0} = 0.\n|\nj\nj\nTheorem 2.24 is proved.\nRemark 2.27. As in the quantum situation, Theorem 2.24 can be generalized to complex\nreflection groups, giving integrable systems with Hamiltonians which are non-quadratic in\nmomentum variables.\n2.11. Notes.

Above we have made essential use of the commutation\nrelations between operators x ∈ h∗, g ∈ G, and Da, a ∈ h. This makes it natural to consider\nthe algebra generated by these operators.\nDefinition 3.1. The rational Cherednik algebra associated to (G, h) is the algebra Hc(G, h)\ngenerated inside A = Rees(CG n D(hreg)) by the elements x ∈ h∗, g ∈ G, and Da(c, ~), a ∈ h.\nIf t ∈ C, then the algebra Ht,c(G, h) is the specialization of Hc(G, h) at ~ = t.\nProposition 3.2. The algebra Hc is the quotient of the algebra CG n T(h ⊕ h∗)[~] (where\nT denotes the tensor algebra) by the ideal generated by the relations\n[x, x0] = 0, [y, y0] = 0, [y, x] = ~(y, x) -\ncs(y, αs)(x, α∨)s,\ns\ns∈S\nwhere x, x0 ∈ h∗, y, y0 ∈ h.\nProof. Let us denote the algebra defined in the proposition by Hc\n0 = Hc\n0(G, h). Then accord\ning to the results of the previous sections, we have a surjective homomorphism φ : Hc\nHc\ndefined by the formula φ(x) = x, φ(g) = g, φ(y) = Dy(c, ~).\n→\nLet us show that this homomorphism is injective. For this purpose assume that yi is a\nbasis of h, and xi is the dual basis of h∗. Then it is clear from the relations of Hc\n0 that Hc\n0 is\nspanned over C[~] by the elements\nr\nr\n(3.1)\ng\nyi\nmi\nxi\nni .\ni=1\ni=1\nThus it remains to show that the images of the elements (3.1) under the map φ, i.e. the\nelements\nr\nr\ng\nDyi (c, ~)mi\nxi\nni .\ni=1\ni=1\nare linearly independent. But this follows from the obvious fact that the symbols of these\nelements in CG n C[h∗ × hreg][~] are linearly independent. The proposition is proved.\n\nRemark 3.3. 1. Similarly, one can define the universal algebra H(G, h), in which both ~\nand c are variables. (So this is an algebra over C[~, c].) It has two equivalent definitions\nsimilar to the above.\n2. It is more convenient to work with algebras defined by generators and relations than\nwith subalgebras of a given algebra generated by a given set of elements. Therefore, from\nnow on we will use the statement of Proposition 3.2 as a definition of the rational Cherednik\nalgebra Hc. According to Proposition 3.2, this algebra comes with a natural embedding\nΘc : Hc → Rees(CG n D(hreg)), defined by the formula x → x, g → g, y → Dy(c, ~). This\nembedding is called the Dunkl operator embedding.\nExample 3.4. 1. Let G = Z2, h = C. In this case c reduces to one parameter, and the\nalgebra Ht,c is generated by elements x, y, s with defining relations\ns 2 = 1, sx = -xs, sy = -ys, [y, x] = t - 2cs.\n\nX\nP\n2. Let G = Sn, h = Cn . In this case there is also only one complex parameter c, and the\nalgebra Ht,c is the quotient of Sn n Chx1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yni by the relations\n[xi, xj ] = [yi, yj ] = 0, [yi, xj ] = csij , [yi, xi] = t - c\nsij .\nj=i\nHere ChEi denotes the free algebra on a set E, and sij is the transposition of i and j.\n3.2. The PBW theorem for the rational Cherednik algebra. Let us put a filtration\non Hc by setting deg y = 1 for y ∈ h and deg x = deg g = 0 for x ∈ h∗, g ∈ G. Let gr(Hc)\ndenote the associated graded algebra of Hc under this filtration, and similarly for Ht,c. We\nhave a natural surjective homomorphism\nξ : CG n C[h ⊕ h∗][~] → gr(Hc).\nFor t ∈ C, it specializes to surjective homomorphisms\nξt : CG n C[h ⊕ h∗] → gr(Ht,c).\nProposition 3.5 (The PBW theorem for rational Cherednik algebras). The maps ξ and ξt\nare isomorphisms.\nProof. The statement is equivalent to the claim that the elements (3.1) are a basis of Ht,c,\nwhich follows from the proof of Proposition 3.2.\n\nRemark 3.6. 1. We have\nH0,0 = CG n C[h ⊕ h∗] and H1,0 = CG n D(h).\n2. For any λ ∈ C∗, the algebra Ht,c is naturally isomorphic to Hλt,λc.\n3. The Dunkl operator embedding Θc specializes to embeddings\nΘ0,c : H0,c ,→ CG n C[h∗ × hreg],\ngiven by x 7→ x, g 7→ g, y 7→ D0, and\na\nΘ1,c : H1,c ,→ CG n D(hreg),\ngiven by x 7→ x, g 7→ g, y 7→ Da. So H0,c is generated by x, g, D0, and H1,c is generated by\na\nx, g, Da.\nSince Dunkl operators map polynomials to polynomials, the map Θ1,c defines a represen\ntation of H1,c on C[h]. This representation is called the polynomial representation of H1,c.\n3.3. The spherical subalgebra. Let e ∈ CG be the symmetrizer, e = |G|-1\ng∈G g. We\nhave e 2 = e.\nDefinition 3.7. Bc := eHce is called the spherical subalgebra of Hc. The spherical subalgebra\nof Ht,c is Bt,c := Bc/(~ - t) = eHt,ce.\nNote that\ne (CG n D(hreg)) e = D(hreg)G ,\ne (CG n C[hreg × h∗]) e = C[hreg × h∗]G .\nTherefore, the restriction gives the embeddings: Θ1,c : B1,c\n)G, and Θ0,c : B0,c ,\nC[h∗ × hreg]G . In particular, we have\n,→D(hreg\n→\nProposition 3.8. The spherical subalgebra B0,c is commutative and does not have zero\ndivisors. Also B0,c is finitely generated.\n\nProof. The first statement is clear from the above. The second statement follows from the\nfact that gr(B0,c) = B0,0 = C[h × h∗]G, which is finitely generated by Hilbert's theorem.\nCorollary 3.9. Mc = SpecB0,c is an irreducible affine algebraic variety.\nProof. Directly from the definition and the proposition.\n\nWe also obtain\nProposition 3.10. Bc is a flat quantization (non-commutative deformation) of B0,c over\nC[~].\nSo B0,c carries a Poisson bracket {·, ·}(thus Mc is a Poisson variety), and Bc is a quanti\nzation of the Poisson bracket, i.e. if a, b ∈ Bc and a0, b0 are the corresponding elements in\nB0,c, then\n[a, b]/~ ≡{a0, b0} (mod ~).\nDefinition 3.11. The Poisson variety Mc is called the Calogero-Moser space of G, h with\nparameter c.\n3.4. The localization lemma. Let Hloc = Ht,c[δ-1] be the localization of Ht,c as a module\nt,c\nover C[h] with respect to the discriminant δ (a polynomial vanishing to the first order on\neach reflection plane). Define also Bloc = eHloc e.\nt,c\nt,c\nProposition 3.12.\n(i) For t = 0 the map Θt,c induces an isomorphism of algebras\nHloc\n), which restricts to an isomorphism Bloc\n)G .\nt,c → CG n D(hreg\nt,c →D(hreg\n(ii) The map Θ0,c induces an isomorphism of algebras Hloc → CG n C[h∗ × hreg], which\n0,c\nrestricts to an isomorphism Bloc\n]G .\n0,c → C[h∗ × hreg\nProof. This follows immediately from the fact that the Dunkl operators have poles only on\nthe reflection hyperplanes.\n\nSince gr(B0,c) = B0,0 = C[h∗ ⊕ h]G, we get the following geometric corollary.\nCorollary 3.13.\n(i) The family of Poisson varieties Mc is a flat deformation of the\nPoisson variety M0 := (h × h∗)/G. In particular, Mc is smooth outside of a subset of\ncodimension 2.\n(ii) We have a natural map βc : Mc\nh/G, such that βc\n-1(hreg/G) is isomorphic to\n→\n(hreg ×h∗)/G. The Poisson structure on Mc is obtained by extension of the symplectic\nPoisson structure on (hreg × h∗)/G.\nExample 3.14. Let W = Z2, h = C. Then B0,c = hx2, xp, p2 -c2/x2i. Let X := x2, Z := xp\nand Y := p2 -c2/x2 . Then Z2 - XY = c2 . So Mc is isomorphic to the quadric Z2 -XY = c2\nin the 3-dimensional space and it is smooth for c = 0.\n3.5. Category O for rational Cherednik algebras. From the PBW theorem, we see that\nH1,c = Sh∗ ⊗ CG ⊗ Sh. It is similar to the structure of the universal enveloping algebra of a\nsimple Lie algebra: U(g) = U(n-)⊗U(h)⊗U(n+). Namely, the subalgebra CG plays the role\nof the Cartan subalgebra, and the subalgebras Sh∗ and Sh play the role of the positive and\nnegative nilpotent subalgebras. This similarity allows one to define and study the category\nO analogous to the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category O for simple Lie algebras.\n\nM\nDefinition 3.15. The category Oc(G, h) is the category of modules over H1,c(G, h) which\nare finitely generated over Sh∗ and locally finite under Sh (i.e., for M ∈Oc(G, h), ∀v ∈ M,\n(Sh)v is finite dimensional).\nIf M is a locally finite (Sh)G-module, then\nM = ⊕λ∈h∗/GMλ,\nwhere\nMλ = {v ∈ M|∀p ∈ (Sh)G , ∃N s.t. (p - λ(p))N v = 0},\n(notice that h∗/G = Specm(Sh)G).\nProposition 3.16. Mλ are H1,c-submodules.\nProof. Note first that we have an isomorphism μ : H1,c(G, h) ∼H1,c\n=\n(G, h∗), which is given\nby xa\nNow let x1, . . . , xr be a basis of h∗ and y1, . . . , yr a basis of h.\n7→ ya, yb 7→ -xb, g 7→ g.\nSuppose P = P (x1, . . . , xr) ∈ (Sh∗)G . Then we have\n∂\n[y, P ] = ∂y P ∈ Sh∗, where y ∈ h,\n(this follows from the fact that both sides act in the same way in the polynomial represen\ntation, which is faithful). So using the isomorphism μ, we conclude that if Q ∈ (Sh)G, Q =\nQ(y1, . . . , yr), then [x, Q] = -∂xQ for x ∈ h∗.\nNow, to prove the proposition, the only thing we need to check is that Mλ is invariant\nunder x ∈ h∗. For any v ∈ Mλ, we have (Q - λ(Q))N v = 0 for some N. Then\n(Q - λ(Q))N+1 xv = (N + 1)∂xQ (Q - λ(Q))N v = 0.\n·\nSo xv ∈ Mλ.\nCorollary 3.17. We have the following decomposition:\nOc(G, h) =\nOc(G, h)λ,\nλ∈h∗/G\nwhere Oc(G, h)λ is the subcategory of modules where (Sh)G acts with generalized eigenvalue\nλ.\nProof. Directly from the definition and the proposition.\n\nNote that Oc(G, h)λ is an abelian category closed under taking subquotients and exten\nsions.\n3.6. The grading element. Let\nX\nX 2cs\n(3.2)\nh =\nxiyi + 2 dim h -\n1 - λs\ns.\ni\ns∈S\nProposition 3.18. We have\n[h, x] = x, x ∈ h∗,\n[h, y] = -y, y ∈ h.\n\nX\nX\nP\nProof. Let us prove the first relation; the second one is proved similarly. We have\n[h, x]\n=\nX\nxi[yi, x] -\nX\n-\ncs\nλs\n· λs\n- 1(α∨, x)αs · s\ns\ni\nX\ns∈S\nX\n=\nxi(yi, x) -\n(α∨, x)(αs, yi)s +\n(α∨, x)αs · s.\nxi\ncs\ns\ncs\ns\ni\ni\nP\ns∈S\nP\ns∈S\nThe last two terms cancel since\ni xi(αs, yi) = αs, so we get\ni xi(yi, x) = x.\n\nProposition 3.19. Let G = W be a real reflection group. Let\nX\nX\n1 X\n1 X\nh =\nxiyi +\ndim h -\ncss,\nE = -\nxi\n2 ,\nF =\nyi\n2 .\ni\ni\ni\ns∈S\nThen\n(i) h =\ni(xiyi + yixi)/2;\n(ii) h, E, F form an sl2-triple.\nProof. A direct calculation.\n\nTheorem 3.20. Let M be a module over H1,c(G, h).\n(i) If h acts locally nilpotently on M, then h acts locally finitely on M.\n(ii) If M is finitely generated over Sh∗, then M ∈Oc(G, h)0 if and only if h acts locally\nfinitely on M.\nProof. (i) Assume that Sh acts locally nilpotently on M. Let v ∈ M. Then Sh v is a finite\n·\ndimensional vector space and let d = dim Sh v. We prove that v is h-finite by induction\n·\nin dimension d. We can use d = 0 as base, so only need to do the induction step. The\nspace Sh v must contain a nonzero vector u such that y\nu = 0, ∀y ∈ h. Let U ⊂ M be\n·\n·\nthe subspace of vectors with this property. h acts on U by an element of CG, hence locally\nfinitely. So it is sufficient to show that the image of v in M/hUi is h-finite (where hUi is\nthe submodule generated by U). But this is true by the induction assumption, as u = 0 in\nM/hUi.\n(ii) We need to show that if h acts locally finitely on M, then h acts locally nilpotently\non M. Assume h acts locally finitely on M. Then M = ⊕β∈B M[β], where B ⊂ C. Since M\nis finitely generated over Sh∗, B is a finite union of sets of the form z + Z≥0, z ∈ C. So Sh\nmust act locally nilpotently on M.\n\nWe can obtain the following corollary easily.\nCorollary 3.21. Any finite dimensional H1,c(G, h)-module is in Oc(G, h)0.\nWe see that any module M ∈Oc(G, h)0 has a grading by generalized eigenvalues of h:\nM = ⊕β M[β].\n3.7. Standard modules. Let τ be a finite dimensional representation of G. The standard\nmodule over H1,c(G, h) corresponding to τ (also called the Verma module) is\nMc(G, h, τ) = Mc(τ) = H1,c(G, h) ⊗CGnSh τ ∈Oc(G, h)0,\nwhere Sh acts on τ by zero.\nSo from the PBW theorem, we have that as vector spaces, Mc(τ) ∼= τ ⊗ Sh∗.\n\nRemark 3.22. More generally, ∀λ ∈ h∗, let Gλ = Stab(λ), and τ be a finite dimensional\nrepresentation of Gλ. Then we can define Mc,λ(G, h, τ) = H1,c(G, h) ⊗CGλnSh τ , where Sh\nacts on τ by λ. These modules are called the Whittaker modules.\nLet τ be irreducible, and let hc(τ) be the number given by the formula\ndim h\nX 2cs\nhc(τ) =\n-\n1 - λs\ns|τ .\ns∈S\nThen we see that h acts on τ ⊗ Smh∗ by the scalar hc(τ) + m.\nDefinition 3.23. A vector v in an H1,c-module M is singular if yiv = 0 for all i.\nProposition 3.24. Let U be an H1,c(G, h)-module. Let τ ⊂ U be a G-submodule consisting\nof singular vectors. Then there is a unique homomorphism φ : Mc(τ )\nU of C[h]-modules\n→\nsuch that φ|τ is the identity, and it is an H1,c-homomorphism.\nProof. The first statement follows from the fact that Mc(τ) is a free module over C[h] gen\nerated by τ. Also, it follows from the Frobenius reciprocity that there must exist a map φ\nwhich is an H1,c-homomorphism. This implies the proposition.\n\n3.8. Finite length.\nProposition 3.25. ∃K ∈ R such that for any M ⊂ N in Oc(G, h)0, if M[β] = N[β] for\nRe (β) ≤ K, then M = N.\nProof. Let K = maxτ Re hc(τ). Then if M = N, M/N begins in degree β0 with Re β0 > K,\nwhich is impossible since by Proposition 3.24, β0 must equal hc(τ) for some τ.\n\nCorollary 3.26. Any M ∈Oc(G, h)0 has finite length.\nProof. Directly from the proposition.\n\n3.9. Characters. For M ∈Oc(G, h)0, define the character of M as the following formal\nseries in t:\nX\nch M (g, t) =\ntβTr M[β](g) = Tr M (gth),\ng ∈ G.\nβ\nProposition 3.27. We have\nχτ (g)thc(τ )\nch Mc(τ )(g, t) =\n.\ndeth∗ (1 - tg)\nProof. We begin with the following lemma.\nLemma 3.28 (MacMahon's Master theorem). Let V be a finite dimensional space, A : V →\nV a linear operator. Then\nX\ntnTr (SnA) =\n.\nn≥0\ndet(1 - tA)\nProof of the lemma. If A is diagonalizable, this is obvious. The general statement follows by\ncontinuity.\n\nThe lemma implies that Tr Sh∗ (gtD) =\nwhere D is the degree operator. This\ndet(1 - gt)\nimplies the required statement.\n\n( (\n?\n3.10. Irreducible modules. Let τ be an irreducible representation of G.\nProposition 3.29. Mc(τ) has a maximal proper submodule Jc(τ).\nProof. The proof is standard. Jc(τ) is the sum of all proper submodules of Mc(τ), and it is\nnot equal to Mc(τ) because any proper submodule has a grading by generalized eigenspaces\nof h, with eigenvalues β such that β - hc(τ) > 0.\n\nWe define Lc(τ) = Mc(τ )/Jc(τ), which is an irreducible module.\nProposition 3.30. Any irreducible object of Oc(G, h)0 has the form Lc(τ) for an unique τ.\nProof. Let L ∈Oc(G, h)0 be irreducible, with lowest eigenspace of h containing an irreducible\nG-module τ. Then by Proposition 3.24, we have a nonzero homomorphism Mc(τ)\nL, which\nis surjective, since L is irreducible. Then we must have L = Lc(τ).\n→\n\nRemark 3.31. Let χ be a character of G. Then we have an isomorphism H1,c(G, h) →\nH1,cχ(G, h), mapping g ∈ G to χ-1(g)g. This automorphism maps Lc(τ) to Lcχ(χ-1 ⊗ τ)\nisomorphically.\n3.11. The contragredient module. Set c(s) = c(s-1). We have a natural isomorphism\nγ : H1,c (G, h∗)op → H1,c(G, h), acting trivially on h and h∗, and sending g ∈ G to g-1 .\nThus if M is an H1,c(G, h)-module, then the full dual space M ∗ is an H1,c (M, h∗)-module.\nIf M ∈Oc(G, h)0, then we can define M +, which is the h-finite part of M ∗.\nProposition 3.32. M + belongs to Oc (G, h∗)0.\nProof. Clearly, if L is irreducible, then so is L+. Then L+ is generated by its lowest h\neigenspace over H1,c (G, h∗), hence over Sh∗. Thus, L+ ∈Oc (G, h∗)0. Now, let M ∈Oc(G, h)0\nbe any object. Since M has finite length, so does M +. Moreover, M + has a finite filtration\nwith successive quotients of the form L+, where L ∈Oc(G, h)0 is irreducible. This implies\nthe required statement, since Oc(G, h)0 is closed under taking extensions.\n\nClearly, M ++ = M. Thus, M 7→ M + is an equivalence of categories Oc(G, h) →Oc (G, h∗)op.\n3.12. The contravariant form. Let τ be an irreducible representation of G. By Propo\nsition 3.24, we have a unique homomorphism φ : Mc(G, h, τ)\nMc (G, h∗, τ ∗)+ which is the\n→\nidentity in the lowest h-eigenspace. Thus, we have a pairing\nβc : Mc(G, h, τ) × Mc (G, h∗, τ ∗) → C,\nwhich is called the contravariant form.\nRemark 3.33. If G =\n=\n= c, and τ ∼τ ∗\nW is a real reflection group, then h ∼h∗, c\n\n=\nvia a\nsymmetric form. So for real reflection groups, βc is a symmetric form on Mc(τ ).\nProposition 3.34. The maximal proper submodule Jc(τ ) is the kernel of φ (or, equivalently,\nof the contravariant form βc).\nProof. Let K be the kernel of the contravariant form. It suffices to show that Mc(τ)/K is\nirreducible. We have a diagram:\nφ\nMc(G, h, τ)\n� Mc(G, h∗, τ ∗)+\nPPPPPPPPPPPP\n�\nξ\nLc(G, h, τ)\nη\n∼ / Lc(G, h∗, τ ∗)+\n\nX\nX\nP\nX\nIndeed, a nonzero map ξ exists by Proposition 3.24, and it factors through Lc(G, h, τ),\nwith η being an isomorphism, since Lc(G, h∗, τ ∗)+ is irreducible. Now, by Proposition 3.24\n(uniqueness of φ), the diagram must commute up to scaling, which implies the statement.\nProposition 3.35. Assume that hc(τ) - hc(τ 0) never equals a positive integer for any τ, τ 0 ∈\nIrrepG. Then Oc(G, h)0 is semisimple, with simple objects Mc(τ).\nProof. It is clear that in this situation, all Mc(τ) are simple. Also consider Ext1(Mc(τ), Mc(τ 0)).\nIf hc(τ)-hc(τ 0) ∈/ Z, it is clearly 0. Otherwise, hc(τ) = hc(τ 0), and again Ext1(Mc(τ), Mc(τ 0)) =\n→\n0, since for any extension\nMc(τ 0)\nN\n→\n→\n→ Mc(τ) → 0,\nby Proposition 3.24 we have a splitting Mc(τ)\nN.\n\nRemark 3.36. In fact, our argument shows that if Ext1(Mc(τ), Mc(τ 0)) 6= 0, then hc(τ) -\nhc(τ 0) ∈ N.\n3.13. The matrix of multiplicities. For τ, σ ∈ IrrepG, write τ < σ if\nRe hc(σ) - Re hc(τ) ∈ N.\nProposition 3.37. There exists a matrix of integers N = (nσ,τ ), with nσ,τ ≥ 0, such that\nnτ,τ = 1, nσ,τ = 0 unless σ < τ , and\nMc(σ) =\nnσ,τ Lc(τ) ∈ K0(Oc(G, h)0).\nProof. This follows from the Jordan-H older theorem and the fact that objects in Oc(G, h)0\nhave finite length.\n\nCorollary 3.38. Let N -1 = ( nτ,σ). Then\nLc(τ) =\nn τ,σMc(σ).\nCorollary 3.39. We have\nn τ,σχσ(g)thc(τ )\nch Lc(τ )(g, t) =\n.\ndeth∗ (1 - tg)\nBoth of the corollaries can be obtained from the above proposition easily.\nOne of the main problems in the representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras is\nthe following problem.\nProblem: Compute the multiplicities nσ,τ or, equivalently, ch Lc(τ ) for all τ.\nIn general, this problem is open.\n3.14. Example: the rank 1 case. Let G = Z/mZ and λ be an m-th primitive root of 1.\nThen the algebra H1,c(G, h) is generated by x, y, s with relations\nm-1\n[y, x] = 1 - 2\ncj sj ,\nsxs-1 = λx,\nsys-1 = λ-1 y.\nj=1\nConsider the one-dimensional space C and let y act by 0 and g ∈ G act by 1. We have\nMc(C) = C[x]. The contravariant form βc,C on Mc(C) is defined by\nn\nn\nβc,C(x , x n) = an;\nβc,C(x , x n0 ) = 0, n 6= n0.\n\nX\n\nn\nRecall that βc,C satisfies βc,C(x , xn) = βc,C(xn-1, yxn), which gives\nan = an-1(n - bn),\nwhere bn are new parameters:\nm-1 1 - λjn\nbn := 2\ncj\n(b0 = 0, bn+m = bn).\n1 - λj\nj=1\nThus we obtain the following proposition.\nProposition 3.40.\n(i) Mc(C) is irreducible if only if n - bn = 0\nfor any n ≥ 1.\n(ii) Assume that r is the smallest positive integer such that r = br. Then Lc(C) has\ndimension r (which can be any number not divisible by m) with basis 1, x, . . . , xr-1 .\nRemark 3.41. According to Remark 3.31, this proposition in fact describes all the irre\nducible lowest weight modules.\nExample 3.42. Consider the case m = 2. The Mc(C) is irreducible unless c ∈ 1/2 + Z≥0.\nIf c = (2n + 1)/2 ∈ 1/2 + Z, n ≥ 0, then Lc(C) has dimension 2n + 1. A similar answer is\nobtained for lowest weight C-, replacing c by -c.\n3.15. The Frobenius property. Let A be a Z+-graded commutative algebra. The algebra\nA is called Frobenius if the top degree A[d] of A is 1-dimensional, and the multiplication\nmap A[m] × A[d - m]\nA[d] is a nondegenerate pairing for any 0 ≤ m ≤ d. In particular,\n→\nthe Hilbert polynomial of a Frobenius algebra A is palindromic.\nNow, let us go back to considering modules over the rational Cherednik algebra H1,c. Any\nsubmodule J of the polynomial representation Mc(C) = Mc = C[h] is an ideal in C[h], so\nthe quotient A = Mc/J is a Z+-graded commutative algebra.\nNow suppose that G preserves an inner product in h, i.e., G ⊆ O(h).\nTheorem 3.43. If A = Mc(C)/J is finite dimensional, then A is irreducible (A = Lc(C))\n⇐⇒ A is a Frobenius algebra.\nProof. 1) Suppose A is an irreducible H1,c-module, i.e., A = Lc(C). By Proposition 3.19, A\nis naturally a finite dimensional sl2-module (in particular, it integrates to the group SL2(C)).\nHence, by the representation theory of sl2, the top degree of A is 1-dimensional. Let φ ∈ A∗\ndenote a nonzero linear function on the top component. Let βc be the contravariant form\non Mc(C). Consider the form\n(v1, v2) 7→ E(v1, v2) := βc(v1, gv2), where g =\n-1\n∈ SL2(C).\nThen E(xv1, v2) = E(v1, xv2). So for any p, q ∈ Mc(C) = C[h], E(p, q) = φ(p(x)q(x)) (for a\nsuitable normalization of φ).\nSince E is a nondegenerate form, A is a Frobenius algebra.\n2) Suppose A is Frobenius.\nThen the highest component is 1-dimensional, and\nE : A ⊗ A → C, E(a, b) = φ(ab) is nondegenerate. We have E(xa, b) = E(a, xb). So\nset β(a, b) = E(a, g-1b). Then β satisfies β(a, xib) = β(yia, b). Thus, for all p, q ∈ C[h],\nβ(p(x), q(x)) = β(q(y)p(x), 1). So β = βc up to scaling. Thus, βc is nondegenerate and A is\nirreducible.\n\nRemark 3.44. If G * O(h), this theorem is false, in general.\n\nNow consider the Frobenius property of Lc(C) for any G ⊂ GL(h).\nTheorem 3.45. Let U ⊂ Mc(C) = C[h] be a G-subrepresentation of dimension l = dim h,\nsitting in degree r, which consists of singular vectors. Let J = hUi. Assume that A = Mc/J\nis finite dimensional. Then\n(i) A is Frobenius.\n(ii) A admits a BGG type resolution:\nA ← Mc(C) ← Mc(U) ← Mc(∧2U) ← · · · ← Mc(∧lU) ← 0.\n(iii) The character of A is given by the formula\nl\n2cs\nχA(g, t) = t 2 - P\n1-λs detU (1 - gtr) .\ns∈S\ndeth∗ (1 - gt)\nIn particular, dim A = rl .\n(iv) If G preserves an inner product, then A is irreducible.\nProof. (i) Since Spec A is a complete intersection, A is Frobenius.\n(ii) We will use the following theorem:\nTheorem 3.46 (Serre). Let f1, . . . , fn ∈ C[t1, . . . , tn] be homogeneous polynomials, and\nassume that C[t1, . . . , tn] is a finitely generated module over C[f1, . . . , fn]. Then this is a free\nmodule.\nConsider SU ⊂ Sh∗. Then Sh∗ is a finitely generated SU-module (as Sh∗/hUi is finite\ndimensional). By Serre's theorem, we know that Sh∗ is a free SU-module. The rank of this\nmodule is rl . Consider the Koszul complex attached to this module. Since the module is\nfree, the Koszul complex is exact (i.e., it is a resolution of the zero fiber). At the level of\nSU-modules, it looks exactly like we want in (3.45).\nSo we only need to show that the maps of the resolution are morphisms over H1,c. This\nis shown by induction. Namely, let δj : Mc(∧j U) → Mc(∧j-1U) be the corresponding\ndifferentials (so that δ0 : Mc(C)\nA is the projection). Then δ0 is an H1,c-morphism, which\n→\nis the base of induction. If δj is an H1,c-morphism, then the kernel of δj is a submodule\nKj ⊂ Mc(∧j U). Its lowest degree part is ∧j+1U sitting in degree (j + 1)r and consisting of\nsingular vectors. Now, δj+1 is a morphism over Sh∗ which maps ∧j+1U identically to itself.\nBy Proposition 3.24, there is only one such morphism, and it must be an H1,c-morphism.\nThis completes the induction step.\n(iii) follows from (ii) by the Euler-Poincar e formula.\n(iv) follows from Theorem 3.43.\n3.16. Representations of H1,c of type A. Let us now apply the above results to the case\nof type A. We will follow the paper [CE].\nLet G = Sn, and h be its reflection representation. In this case the function c reduces\nto one number. We will denote the rational Cherednik algebra H1,c(Sn) by Hc(n). It is\ngenerated by x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn and CSn with the following relations:\nX\nX\nyi = 0,\nxi = 0,\n[yi, xj] = -n + csij , i =6\nj,\n\nP\nY\nX\n\n!\nn - 1\nX\n[yi, xi] =\n- c\nsij .\nn\nj=i\nThe polynomial representation Mc(C) of this algebra is the space of C[x1, . . . , xn]T of poly\nnomials of x1, . . . , xn, which are invariant under simultaneous translation T : xi 7→ xi + a.\nIn other words, it is the space of regular functions on h = Cn/Δ, where Δ is the diagonal.\nProposition 3.47 (C. Dunkl). Let r be a positive integer not divisible by n, and c = r/n.\nThen Mc(C) contains a copy of the reflection representation h of Sn, which consists of\nsingular vectors (i.e. those killed by y ∈ h). This copy sits in degree r and is spanned by the\nfunctions\ndz\nr\nn\nfi(x1, . . . , xn) = Resinf[(z - x1)\n(z - xn)]\n· · ·\n.\nz - xi\n(the symbol Resinf denotes the residue at infinity).\nRemark 3.48. The space spanned by fi is (n - 1)-dimensional, since\nfi = 0 (this sum\ni\nis the residue of an exact differential).\nProof. This proposition can be proved by a straightforward computation. The functions fi\nare a special case of Jack polynomials.\n\nLet Ic be the submodule of Mc(C) generated by fi. Consider the Hc(n)-module Vc =\nMc(C)/Ic, and regard it as a C[h]-module. We have the following results.\nTheorem 3.49. Let d = (r, n) denote the greatest common divisor of r and n. Then the\n(set-theoretical) support of Vc is the union of Sn-translates of the subspaces of Cn/Δ, defined\nby the equations\n;\nx\n;\n. . .\nx(d-1)\nx1 = x2 =\n= x\n· · ·\n+1 = · · · = x2\n+1 = · · · = xn.\nn\nn\nn\nn\nd\nd\nd\nd\nIn particular, the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of Vc is d - 1.\nCorollary 3.50 ([BEG]). If d = 1 then the module Vc is finite dimensional, irreducible,\nadmits a BGG type resolution, and its character is\nχVc (g, t) = t(1-r)(n-1)/2 det |h(1 - gtr) .\ndet |h(1 - gt)\nProof. For d = 1 Theorem 3.49 says that the support of Mc(C)/Ic is {0}. This implies that\nMc(C)/Ic is finite dimensional. The rest follows from Theorem 3.45.\n\nProof of Theorem 3.49. The support of Vc is the zero set of Ic, i.e. the common zero set of\nn\nX\nfi. Fix x1, . . . , xn ∈ C. Then fi(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 for all i iff\nλifi = 0 for all λi, i.e.\n\n!\ni=1\nn\nY\nn\nX\nr\nλi\nn\nResinf\n(z - xj )\ndz = 0.\nz - xi\nj=1\ni=1\nAssume that x1, . . . xn take distinct values y1, . . . , yp with positive multiplicities m1, . . . , mp.\nThe previous equation implies that the point (x1, . . . , xn) is in the zero set iff\np\np\n(z\\\n- yi)\nr\nResinf\n(z - yj )mj n -1\nνi(z - y1)\n· · · (z - yp)\ndz = 0 ∀νi.\n· · ·\nj=1\ni=1\n\nY\nY\nP\nP\nX\nY\nX\nP\nP\nY\nSince νi are arbitrary, this is equivalent to the condition\np\nResinf\n(z - yj )mj n\nr -1 z idz = 0,\ni = 0, . . . , p - 1.\nj=1\nWe will now need the following lemma.\np\nLemma 3.51. Let a(z) =\n(z -yj )μj , where μj ∈ C,\nj μj ∈ Z and\nj μj > -p. Suppose\nj=1\nResinfa(z)z idz = 0,\ni = 0, 1, . . . , p - 2.\nThen a(z) is a polynomial.\nProof. Let g(z) be a polynomial. Then\n0 = Resinfd(g(z) a(z)) = Resinf(g0(z)a(z) + a0(z)g(z))dz,\n·\nand hence\n\n!\nRes\ng0(z) +\nμj\ng(z) a(z)dz = 0.\ninf\nz - yj\ni\nLet g(z) = z l\n(z - yj). Then g0(z) +\nz -\nμj\nyj\ng(z) is a polynomial of degree l + p - 1\nj\nP\nj P\nwith highest coefficient l + p +\nμj = 0 (as\nμj > -p). This means that for every l ≥ 0,\nResinfz l+p-1 a(z)dz is a linear combination of residues of zqa(z)dz with q < l + p - 1. By\nthe assumption of the lemma, this implies by induction in l that all such residues are 0 and\nhence a is a polynomial.\n\nIn our case\n(mj r/n - 1) = r - p (since\nmj = n) and the conditions of the lemma are\np\nsatisfied. Hence (x1, . . . , xn) is in the zero set of Ic iff\n(z - yj)mj n\nr -1 is a polynomial. This\nj=1\nis equivalent to saying that all mj are divisible by n/d.\nWe have proved that (x1, . . . , xn) is in the zero set of Ic if and only if (z - x1)\n(z - xn)\n· · ·\nis the (n/d)-th power of a polynomial of degree d. This implies the theorem.\n\nRemark 3.52. For c > 0, the above representations are the only irreducible finite di\nmensional representations of H1,c(Sn). Namely, it is proved in [BEG] that the only finite\ndimensional representations of H1,c(Sn) are multiples of Lc(C) for c = r/n, and of Lc(C-)\n(where C- is the sign representation) for c = -r/n, where r is a positive integer relatively\nprime to n.\n3.17.

Let W be a finite\nCoxeter group of rank r with real reflection representation hR equipped with a Euclidean\nW -invariant inner product (·, ). Denote by h the complexification of hR. The reflection\n·\nhyperplanes subdivide hR into |W | chambers; let us pick one of them to be the dominant\nchamber and call its interior D. For each reflection hyperplane, pick the perpendicular vector\nα ∈ hR with (α, α) = 2 which has positive inner products with elements of D, and call it\nthe positive root corresponding to this hyperplane. The walls of D are then defined by the\nequations (αi, v) = 0, where αi are simple roots. Denote by S the set of reflections in W ,\nand for a reflection s ∈S denote by αs the corresponding positive root. Let\nδ(x) =\n(αs, x)\ns∈S\nbe the corresponding discriminant polynomial. Let di, i = 1, . . . , r, be the degrees of the\ngenerators of the algebra C[h]W . Note that W =\ni di.\n|\n|\n-k\nLet H1,c(W, h) be the rational Cherednik algebra of W . Here we choose c =\nas a\nconstant function. Let Mc = Mc(C) be the polynomial representation of H1,c(W, h), and βc\nbe the contravariant form on Mc defined in Section 3.12. We normalize it by the condition\nβc(1, 1) = 1.\nTheorem 4.1.\n(i) (The Macdonald-Mehta integral) For Re (k) ≥ 0, one has\nZ\nrY Γ(1 + kdi)\n(4.1)\n(2π)-r/2\nhR\ne-(x,x)/2|δ(x)|2kdx =\nΓ(1 + k) .\ni=1\n(ii) Let b(k) := βc(δ, δ). Then\nr\ndi-1\nb(k) = |W |\n(kdi + m).\ni=1 m=1\nFor Weyl groups, this theorem was proved by E. Opdam [Op1]. The non-crystallographic\ncases were done by Opdam in [Op2] using a direct computation in the rank 2 case (reducing\n(4.1) to the beta integral by passing to polar coordinates), and a computer calculation by F.\nGarvan for H3 and H4.\nExample 4.2. In the case W = Sn, we have the following integral (the Mehta integral):\nZ\nn\n(2π)-(n-1)/2\ne-(x,x)/2 Y\n2kdx =\nY Γ(1 + kd) .\n{x∈Rn| P\ni xi=0}\n|xi - xj |\nΓ(1 + k)\ni=j\nd=2\nIn the next subsection, we give a uniform proof of Theorem 4.1 which is given in [E2]. We\nemphasize that many parts of this proof are borrowed from Opdam's previous proof of this\ntheorem.\n4.2. Proof of Theorem 4.1.\nProposition 4.3. The function b is a polynomial of degree at most |S|, and the roots of b\nare negative rational numbers.\n\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nProof. Since δ has degree |S|, it follows from the definition of b that it is a polynomial of\ndegree ≤ |S|.\nSuppose that b(k) = 0 for some k ∈ C. Then βc(δ, P ) = 0 for any polynomial P . Indeed,\nif there exists a P such that βc(δ, P ) = 0, then there exists such a P which is antisymmetric\nof degree |S|. Then P must be a multiple of δ which contradicts the equality βc(δ, δ) = 0.\nThus, Mc is reducible and hence has a singular vector, i.e. a nonzero homogeneous poly\nnomial f of positive degree d living in an irreducible representation τ of W killed by ya.\nApplying the element h =\ni xai yai + r/2 + k\ns to f, we get\ns∈S\nd ,\nk = -mτ\nwhere mτ is the eigenvalue of the operator T :=\n(1 - s) on τ. But it is clear (by\ns∈S\ncomputing the trace of T ) that mτ ≥ 0 and mτ ∈ Q. This implies that any root of b is\nnegative rational.\n\nDenote the Macdonald-Mehta integral by F (k).\nProposition 4.4. One has\nF (k + 1) = b(k)F (k).\nProof. Let F =\ni ya\ni /2. Introduce the Gaussian inner product on Mc as follows:\nDefinition 4.5. The Gaussian inner product γc on Mc is given by the formula\nγc(v, v0) = βc(exp(F)v, exp(F)v0).\nThis makes sense because the operator F is locally nilpotent on Mc. Note that δ is a\nnonzero W -antisymmetric polynomial of the smallest possible degree, so (\nya\ni )δ = 0 and\nhence\n(4.2)\nγc(δ, δ) = βc(δ, δ) = b(k).\nFor a ∈ h, let xa ∈ h∗ ⊂ H1,c(W, h), ya ∈ h ⊂ H1,c(W, h) be the corresponding generators\nof the rational Cherednik algebra.\nProposition 4.6. Up to scaling, γc is the unique W -invariant symmetric bilinear form on\nMc satisfying the condition\nγc((xa - ya)v, v0) = γc(v, yav0), a ∈ h.\nProof. We have\nγc((xa - ya)v, v0) = βc(exp(F)(xa - ya)v, exp(F)v0) = βc(xa exp(F)v, exp(F)v0)\n= βc(exp(F)v, ya exp(F)v0) = βc(exp(F)v, exp(F)yav0) = γc(v, yav0).\nLet us now show uniqueness. If γ is any W -invariant symmetric bilinear form satisfying\nthe condition of the Proposition, then let β(v, v0) = γ(exp(-F)v, exp(-F)v0). Then β is\ncontravariant, so it's a multiple of βc, hence γ is a multiple of γc.\n\nNow we will need the following known result (see [Du2], Theorem 3.10).\n\nZ\n\nR\nProposition 4.7. For Re (k) ≥ 0 we have\n(4.3)\nγc(f, g) = F (k)-1\nf(x)g(x)dμc(x)\nhR\nwhere\ndμc(x) := e-(x,x)/2|δ(x)|2kdx.\nProof. It follows from Proposition 4.6 that γc is uniquely, up to scaling, determined by the\ncondition that it is W -invariant, and y+ = xa - ya. These properties are easy to check for the\na\nright hand side of (4.3), using the fact that the action of ya is given by Dunkl operators.\nNow we can complete the proof of Proposition 4.4. By Proposition 4.7, we have\nF (k + 1) = F (k)γc(δ, δ),\nso by (4.2) we have\nF (k + 1) = F (k)b(k).\nLet\nY\nb(k) = b0\n(k + ki)ni .\nWe know that ki > 0, and also b0 > 0 (because the inner product β0 on real polynomials is\npositive definite).\nCorollary 4.8. We have\n\nni\nY Γ(k + ki)\nF (k) = bk\n.\nΓ(ki)\ni\nProof. Denote the right hand side by F∗(k) and let φ(k) = F (k)/F∗(k). Clearly, φ(0) = 1.\nProposition 4.4 implies that φ(k) is a 1-periodic positive function on [0, inf). Also by the\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality,\nF (k)F (k0) ≥ F ((k + k0)/2)2 ,\nso log F (k) is convex for k ≥ 0. This implies that φ = 1, since (log F∗(k))00 → 0 as k →\n+inf.\n\nRemark 4.9. The proof of this corollary is motivated by the standard proof of the following\nwell known characterization of the Γ function.\nProposition 4.10. The Γ function is determined by three properties:\n(i) Γ(x) is positive on [1, +inf) and Γ(1) = 1;\n(ii) Γ(x + 1) = xΓ(x);\n(iii) log Γ(x) is a convex function on [1, +inf).\nProof. It is easy to see from the definition Γ(x) =\ninf tx-1e-tdt that the Γ function has\nproperties (i) and (ii); property (iii) follows from this definition and the Cauchy-Schwarz\ninequality.\nConversely, suppose we have a function F (x) satisfying the above properties, then we have\nF (x) = φ(x)Γ(x) for some 1-periodic function φ(x) with φ(x) > 0. Thus, we have\n(log F )00 = (log φ)00 + (log Γ)00.\n\nZ\nX\nY\nR\n\nY\nSince limx\n+inf(log Γ)00 = 0, (log F )00 ≥ 0, and φ is periodic, we have (log φ)00 ≥ 0. Since\nR n+1\n→\n(log φ)00dx = 0, we see that (log φ)00 ≡ 0. So we have φ(x) ≡ 1.\n\nn\nIn particular, we see from Corollary 4.8 and the multiplication formulas for the Γ function\nthat part (ii) of Theorem 4.1 implies part (i).\nIt remains to establish (ii).\nProposition 4.11. The polynomial b has degree exactly |S|.\nProof. By Proposition 4.3, b is a polynomial of degree at most |S|. To see that the degree is\nprecisely |S|, let us make the change of variable x = k1/2y in the Macdonald-Mehta integral\nand use the steepest descent method. We find that the leading term of the asymptotics of\nlog F (k) as k → +inf is |S|k log k. This together with the Stirling formula and Corollary 4.8\nimplies the statement.\n\nProposition 4.12. The function\nrY 1 - e2πikdj\nG(k) := F (k)\n2πik\n1 - e\nj=1\nanalytically continues to an entire function of k.\nProof. Let ξ ∈ D be an element. Consider the real hyperplane Ct = itξ + hR, t > 0. Then\nCt does not intersect reflection hyperplanes, so we have a continuous branch of δ(x)2k on\nCt which tends to the positive branch in D as t\n0. Then, it is easy to see that for any\n→\n2πik`(w)\nw ∈ W , the limit of this branch in the chamber w(D) will be e\n|δ(x)|2k, where `(w) is\nthe length of w. Therefore, by letting t = 0, we get\nX\n(2π)-r/2\ne-(x,x)/2δ(x)2kdx =\nF (k)(\ne 2πik`(w))\nCt\n|W |\nw∈W\n(as this integral does not depend on t by Cauchy's theorem). But it is well known that\n2πik`(w)\nr 1 - e2πikdj\ne\n=\n,\n1 - e2πik\nw∈W\nj=1\n([Hu], p.73), so\nZ\n(2π)-r/2|W |\nCt\ne-(x,x)/2δ(x)2kdx = G(k).\nSince\nCt e-(x,x)/2δ(x)2kdx is clearly an entire function, the statement is proved.\nCorollary 4.13. For every k0 ∈ [-1, 0] the total multiplicity of all the roots of b of the\nform k0 - p, p ∈ Z+, equals the number of ways to represent k0 in the form -m/di, m =\n1, . . . , di - 1. In other words, the roots of b are ki,m = -m/di - pi,m, 1 ≤ m ≤ di - 1, where\npi,m ∈ Z+.\nProof. We have\nG(k - p) =\nF (k)\nr 1 - e2πikdj\n,\nb(k - 1)\nb(k - p) j=1 1 - e2πik\n· · ·\n\nX\nX\nX X\nP\nX\nY\nNow plug in k = 1 + k0 and a large positive integer p. Since by Proposition 4.12 the left\nhand side is regular, so must be the right hand side, which implies the claimed upper bound\nfor the total multiplicity, as F (1 + k0) > 0. The fact that the bound is actually attained\nfollows from the fact that the polynomial b has degree exactly |S| (Proposition 4.11), and\nthe fact that all roots of b are negative rational (Proposition 4.3).\n\nIt remains to show that in fact in Corollary 4.13, pi,m = 0 for all i, m; this would imply\n(ii) and hence (i).\nProposition 4.14. Identity (4.1) of Theorem 4.1 is satisfied in C[k]/k2 .\nProof. Indeed, we clearly have F (0) = 1. Next, a rank 1 computation gives F 0(0) = -γ|S|,\nwhere γ is the Euler constant (i.e. γ = limn\n+inf(1 +\n+ 1/n - log n)), while the derivative\n→\n· · ·\nof the right hand side of (4.1) at zero equals to\nr\n-γ\n(di - 1).\ni=1\nBut it is well known that\nr\n(di - 1) = |S|,\ni=1\n([Hu], p.62), which implies the result.\n\nProposition 4.15. Identity (4.1) of Theorem 4.1 is satisfied in C[k]/k3 .\nNote that Proposition 4.15 immediately implies (ii), and hence the whole theorem. Indeed,\nit yields that\nr\ndi-1\n(log F )00(0) =\n(log Γ)00(m/di),\ni=1 m=1\nso by Corollary 4.13\nr X\nr\ndi-1\nX di-1\nX X\n(log Γ)00(m/di + pi,m) =\n(log Γ)00(m/di),\ni=1 m=1\ni=1 m=1\nwhich implies that pi,m = 0 since (log Γ)00 is strictly decreasing on [0, inf).\nTo prove Proposition 4.15, we will need the following result about finite Coxeter groups.\nLet ψ(W ) = 3|S|2 -\nr (d2 - 1).\ni=1\ni\nLemma 4.16. One has\n(4.4)\nψ(W ) =\nψ(G),\nG∈Par2(W )\nwhere Par2(W ) is the set of parabolic subgroups of W of rank 2.\nProof. Let\nr\nQ(q) = |W |\n-\n-\nq\nq .\ndi\ni=1\n\nX\nX\nX Z\nIt follows from Chevalley's theorem that\nQ(q) = (1 - q)r\ndet(1 - qw|h)-1 .\nw∈W\nLet us subtract the terms for w = 1 and w ∈S from both sides of this equation, divide both\nsides by (q - 1)2, and set q = 1 (cf. [Hu], p.62, formula (21)). Let W2 be the set of elements\nof W that can be written as a product of two different reflections. Then by a straightforward\ncomputation we get\nX\nψ(W ) =\n.\nw∈W2 r - Tr h(w)\nIn particular, this is true for rank 2 groups. The result follows, as any element w ∈ W2\nbelongs to a unique parabolic subgroup Gw of rank 2 (namely, the stabilizer of a generic\npoint hw, [Hu], p.22).\n\nProof of Proposition 4.15. Now we are ready to prove the proposition. By Proposition 4.14,\nit suffices to show the coincidence of the second derivatives of (4.1) at k = 0. The second\nderivative of the right hand side of (4.1) at zero is equal to\nπ2\nr\n(d2 - 1) + γ2|S|2 .\ni\ni=1\nOn the other hand, we have\nF 00(0) = (2π)-r/2\ne-(x,x)/2 log α2(x) log β2(x)dx.\nα,β∈S\nhR\nThus, from a rank 1 computation we see that our job is to establish the equality\nZ\nr\n(2π)-r/2 X\ne-(x,x)/2 log α2(x) log α\nβ2\n(\n(\nx\nx\n)\n)dx = π\n(\nX\n(di\n2 - 1) - 3|S|2) = - π\nψ(W ).\nα=β∈S\nhR\ni=1\nSince this equality holds in rank 2 (as in this case (4.1) reduces to the beta integral), in\ngeneral it reduces to equation (4.4) (as for any α 6= β ∈ S, sα and sβ are contained in a\nunique parabolic subgroup of W of rank 2). The proposition is proved.\n\n4.3. Application: the supports of Lc(C). In this subsection we will use the Macdonald-\nMehta integral to computation of the support of the irreducible quotient of the polynoamial\nrepresentation of a rational Cherednik algebra (with equal parameters). We will follow the\npaper [E3].\nFirst note that the vector space h has a stratification labeled by parabolic subgroups of W .\nIndeed, for a parabolic subgroup W 0 ⊂ W , let hW 0 be the set of points in h whose stabilizer\nreg\nis W 0. Then\na\nh =\nhW 0 ,\nreg\nW 0∈Par(W )\nwhere Par(W ) is the set of parabolic subgroups in W .\nFor a finitely generated module M over C[h], denote the support of M by supp (M).\nThe following theorem is proved in [Gi1], Section 6 and in [BE] with different method. We\nwill recall the proof from [BE] later.\n\nTheorem 4.17. Consider the stratification of h with respect to stabilizers of points in W .\nThen the support supp (M) of any object M of Oc(W, h) in h is a union of strata of this\nstratification.\nThis makes one wonder which strata occur in supp (Lc(τ)), for given c and τ. In [VV],\nVaragnolo and Vasserot gave a partial answer for τ = C. Namely, they determined (for W\nbeing a Weyl group) when Lc(C) is finite dimensional, which is equivalent to supp (Lc(C)) =\n0. For the proof (which is quite complicated), they used the geometry affine Springer fibers.\nHere we will give a different (and simpler) proof. In fact, we will prove a more general result.\nRecall that for any Coxeter group W , we have the Poincar e polynomial:\nr\nPW (q) =\nX\nq `(w) =\nY 1 - qdi(W )\n, where di(W ) are the degrees of W.\nw∈W\ni=1\n1 - q\nLemma 4.18. If W 0 ⊂ W is a parabolic subgroup of W , then PW is divisible by PW 0 .\nProof. By Chevalley's theorem, C[h] is a free module over C[h]W and C[h]W 0 is a direct\nsummand in this module. So C[h]W 0 is a projective module, thus free (since it is graded).\nHence, there exists a polynomial Q(q) such that we have\nQ(q)hC[h]W (q) = hC[h]W 0 (q),\nwhere hV (q) denotes the Hilbert series of a graded vector space V . Notice that we have\nhC[h]W (q) =\n, so we have\nPW (q)(1 - q)r\nQ(q)\nPW (q) =\nPW 0 (q), i.e. Q(q) = PW (q)/PW 0 (q).\n\nCorollary 4.19. If m ≥ 2 then we have the following inequality:\n#{i|m divides di(W )} ≥ #{i|m divides di(W 0)}.\nProof. This follows from Lemma 4.18 by looking at the roots of the polynomials PW and\nPW 0 .\n\nOur main result is the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.20. [E3] Let c ≥ 0. Then a ∈ supp (Lc(C)) if and only if\nPW (e 2πic) = 0.\nPWa\nWe can obtain the following corollary easily.\nCorollary 4.21.\n(i) Lc(C) 6= Mc(C) if and only if c ∈ Q>0 and the denominator m of\nc divides di for some i;\n(ii) Lc(C) is finite dimensional if and only if PW (e2πic) = 0, i.e., iff\nPW 0\n#{i|m divides di(W )} > #{i|m divides di(W 0)}.\nfor any maximal parabolic subgroup W 0 ⊂ W .\n\nZ\nZ\nRemark 4.22. Varagnolo and Vasserot prove that Lc(C) is finite dimensional if and only if\nthere exists a regular elliptic element in W of order m. Case-by-case inspection shows that\nthis condition is equivalent to the combinatorial condition of (2). Also, a uniform proof of\nthis equivalence is given in the appendix to [E3], written by S. Griffeth.\nExample 4.23. For type An-1, i.e., W = Sn, we get that Lc(C) is finite dimensional if and\nonly if the denominator of c is n. This agrees with our previous results in type An-1.\nExample 4.24. Suppose W is the Coxeter group of type E7. Then we have the following\nlist of maximal parabolic subgroups and the degrees (note that E7 itself is not a maximal\nparabolic).\nSubgroups\nE7\nD6\nA3 × A2 × A1\nA6\nDegrees\n2,6,8,10,12,14,18 2,4,6,6,8,10\n2,3,4,2,3,2\n2,3,4,5,6,7\nSubgroups\nA4 × A2\nE6\nD5 × A1\nA5 × A1\nDegrees\n2,3,4,5,2,3\n2,5,6,8,9,12\n2,4,5,6,8,2\n2,3,4,5,6,2\nSo Lc(C) is finite dimensional if and only if the denominator of c is 2, 6, 14, 18.\nThe rest of the subsection is dedicated to the proof of Theorem 4.20. First we recall some\nbasic facts about the Schwartz space and tempered distributions.\nLet S(Rn) be the set of Schwartz functions on Rn, i.e.\nS(Rn) = {f ∈ Cinf(Rn)|∀α, β, sup |x α∂β f(x)| < inf}.\nThis space has a natural topology.\nA tempered distribution on Rn is a continuous linear functional on S(Rn). Let S0(Rn)\ndenote the space of tempered distributions.\nWe will use the following well known lemma.\nLemma 4.25.\n(i) C[x]e-x2/2 ⊂ S(Rn) is a dense subspace.\n(ii) Any tempered distribution ξ has finite order, i.e., ∃N = N(ξ) such that if f ∈ S(Rn)\nsatisfying f = df =\n= dN-1f = 0 on supp ξ, then hξ, fi = 0.\n· · ·\nProof of Theorem 4.20. Recall that on Mc(C), we have the Gaussian form γc from Section\n4.2. We have for Re (c) ≤ 0,\n(P, Q) = (2π)-r/2\ne-x2/2 δ(x) -2cP (x)Q(x)dx,\nγc\nFW (-c)\nhR\n|\n|\nwhere P, Q are polynomials and\nFW (k) = (2π)-r/2\ne-x2/2|δ(x)|2kdx\nhR\nis the Macdonald-Mehta integral.\nConsider the distribution:\nξc\nW = (2π)-r/2\nδ(x) -2c .\nFW (-c) |\n|\nIt is well-known that this distribution is meromorphic in c (Bernstein's theorem). Moreover,\nsince γc(P, Q) is a polynomial in c for any P and Q, this distribution is in fact holomorphic\nin c ∈ C.\n\nY\nY\nProposition 4.26.\nsupp (ξc\nW )\n= {a ∈ hR\nFWa (-c) = 0} = {a ∈ hR\nPW (e 2πic) = 0}\n| FW\n|PWa\n= {a ∈ hR|#{i|denominator of c divides di(W )}\n= #{i|denominator of c divides di(Wa)}}.\nProof. First note that the last equality follows from the product formula for the Poincar e\npolynomial, and the second equality from the Macdonald-Mehta identity. Now let us prove\nthe first equality.\nLook at ξW near a ∈ h. Equivalently, we can consider\nc\n(2π)-r/2\nξW (x + a) = FW (-c) |δ(x + a)|-2c\nc\nwith x near 0. We have\nδW (x + a)\n=\nαs(x + a) =\n(αs(x) + αs(a))\ns∈SY\ns∈S\nY\n=\nαs(x)\n(αs(x) + αs(a))\n·\ns∈S∩Wa\ns∈S\\S∩Wa\n= δWa (x) Ψ(x),\n·\nwhere Ψ is a nonvanishing function near a (since αs(a) = 0 if\ns /∈S ∩ Wa).\nSo near a, we have\nξW\nFWa\nξWa\n-2c\nc (x + a) = FW\n(-c) ·\n(x) · |Ψ|\n,\nc\nand the last factor is well defined since Ψ is nonvanishing. Thus ξc\nW (x) is nonzero near a if\nand only if FWa (-c) = 0 which finishes the proof.\n\nFW\nProposition 4.27. For c ≥ 0,\nsupp (ξc\nW ) = supp Lc(C)R,\nwhere the right hand side stands for the real points of the support.\nProof. Let a /∈ supp Lc(C) and assume a ∈ supp ξW . Then we can find a P ∈ Jc(C) = ker γc\nc\nsuch that P (a) = 0. Pick a compactly supported test function\nφ ∈ Cinf(hR) such that P does\nc\nnot vanish anywhere on supp φ, and hξW , φi 6= 0 (this can be done since P (a) 6= 0 and ξW\nc\nc\nis nonzero near a). Then we have φ/P ∈ S(hR). Thus from Lemma 4.25 (i) it follows that\nthere exists a sequence of polynomials Pn such that\nPn(x)e-x2/2 → P\nφ in S(hR), when n →inf.\nSo PPne-x2/2 → φ in S(hR), when n →inf.\nBut we have hξc\nW , PPne-x2/2i = γc(P, Pn) = 0 which is a contradiction. This implies that\nsupp ξc\nW ⊂ (supp Lc(C))R.\nTo show the opposite inclusion, let P be a polynomial on h which vanishes identically on\nsupp ξW . By Lemma 4.25 (ii), there exists N such that hξW , P N (x)Q(x)e-x2/2i = 0. Thus,\nc\nc\n\nfor any polynomial Q, γc(P N , Q) = 0, i.e. P N ∈ Ker γc. Thus, P |supp Lc(C) = 0. This implies\nthe required inclusion, since supp ξc\nW is a union of strata.\n\nTheorem 4.20 follows from Proposition 4.26 and Proposition 4.27.\n\n4.4. Notes.

An important property\nof the rational Cherednik algebra H1,c(G, h) is that it can be sheafified, as an algebra, over\nh/G (see [E1]). More specifically, the usual sheafification of H1,c(G, h) as a Oh/G-module\nis in fact a quasicoherent sheaf of algebras, H1,c,G,h. Namely, for every affine open subset\nU ⊂ h/G, the algebra of sections H1,c,G,h(U) is, by definition, C[U] ⊗C[h]G H1,c(G, h).\nThe same sheaf can be defined more geometrically as follows (see [E1], Section 2.9). Let\nUe be the preimage of U in h. Then the algebra H1,c,G,h(U) is the algebra of linear operators\non O(Ue) generated by O(Ue), the group G, and Dunkl operators\nX 2cs αs(a)\n∂a -\n(1 - s), where a ∈ h.\n1 - λs αs\ns∈S\n5.2. Completion of rational Cherednik algebras. For any b ∈ h we can define the\ncompletion d(G, h)b to be the algebra of sections of the sheaf H1,c,G,h on the formal neigh\nH1,c\nborhood of the image of b in h/G. Namely, d(G, h)b is generated by regular functions on\nH1,c\nthe formal neighborhood of the G-orbit of b, the group G, and Dunkl operators.\nThe algebra d(G, h)b inherits from H1,c(G, h) the natural filtration F by order of dif\nH1,c\n-\nferential operators, and each of the spaces F n d(G, h)b has a projective limit topology; the\nH1,c\nwhole algebra is then equipped with the topology of the nested union (or inductive limit).\nConsider the completion of the rational Cherednik algebra at zero, d(G, h)0. It naturally\nH1,c\ncontains the algebra C[[h]]. Define the category Obc(G, h) of representations of d(G, h)0\nH1,c\nwhich are finitely generated over C[[h]]0 = C[[h]].\nWe have a completion functor b: Oc(G, h)\nObc(G, h), defined by\n→\nM = H1,c(G, h)0 ⊗H1,c(G,h) M = C[[h]] ⊗C[h] M.\nAlso, for N ∈Obc(G, h), let E(N) be the subspace spanned by generalized eigenvectors of\nh in N where h is defined by (3.2). Then it is easy to see that E(N) ∈Oc(G, h)0.\nTheorem 5.1. The restriction of the completion functor b to Oc(G, h)0 is an equivalence\nof categories Oc(G, h)0 →Obc(G, h). The inverse equivalence is given by the functor E.\nProof. It is clear that M ⊂ c\nM) (as M is spanned by generalized eigenvectors\nM, so M ⊂ E(c\nof h). Let us demonstrate the opposite inclusion. Pick generators m1, . . . , mr of M which\nare generalized eigenvectors of h with eigenvalues μ1, . . . , μr. Let 0\nM). Then v\n= v ∈ E(c\n=\nfimi, where fi ∈ C[[h]]. Assume that (h- μ)N v = 0 for some N.\nThen v =\nf (μ-μi)mi,\ni\ni\ni\n= E(c\nwhere for f ∈ C[[h]] we denote by f (d) the degree d part of f. Thus v ∈ M, so M\nM).\nIt remains to show that E\\\n(N) = N, i.e. that N is the closure of E(N). In other words,\nletting m denote the maximal ideal in C[[h]], we need to show that the natural map E(N)\nN/mj N is surjective for every j.\n→\nTo do so, note that h preserves the descending filtration of N by subspaces mj N. On\nthe other hand, the successive quotients of these subspaces, mj N/mj+1N, are finite dimen\nsional, which implies that h acts locally finitely on their direct sum grN, and moreover each\n\nc\nc\nP\ngeneralized eigenspace is finite dimensional. Now for each β ∈ C denote by Nj,β the general\nized β-eigenspace of h in N/mjN. We have surjective homomorphisms Nj+1,β → Nj,β, and\nfor large enough j they are isomorphisms. This implies that the map E(N)\nN/mj N is\nsurjective for every j, as desired.\n→\n\nExample. Suppose that c = 0. Then Theorem 5.1 specializes to the well known fact that\nthe category of G-equivariant local systems on h with a locally nilpotent action of partial\ndifferentiations is equivalent to the category of all G-equivariant local systems on the formal\nneighborhood of zero in h. In fact, both categories in this case are equivalent to the category\nof finite dimensional representations of G.\nWe can now define the composition functor J\nJ (M) = E(M). The functor J is called the Jacquet functor ([Gi2]).\n: Oc(G, h) →Oc(G, h)0, by the formula\n5.3. The duality functor. Recall that in Section 3.11, for any H1,c(G, h)-module M, the\nfull dual space M ∗ is naturally an H1,c (G, h∗)-module, via πM ∗ (a) = πM (γ(a))∗.\nIt is clear that the duality functor ∗ defines an equivalence between the category Oc\n(G, h∗)op, and that M + = E(M ∗) (where M + is the contragredient, or restricted dual\nb\nO\n(G, h)0\nand\nc\nmodule to M defined in Section 3.11).\n5.4. Generalized Jacquet functors.\nProposition 5.2. For any M ∈\nh-nilpotent.\nb\nOc(G, h), a vector v ∈ M is h-finite if and only if it is\nProof. The \"if\" part follows from Theorem 3.20. To prove the \"only if\" part, assume that\n(h - μ)N v = 0. Then for any u ∈ Srh v, we have (h - μ + r)N u = 0. But by Theorem 5.1,\n·\nthe real parts of generalized eigenvalues of h in M are bounded below. Hence Srh v = 0 for\n·\nlarge enough r, as desired.\n\nAccording to Proposition 5.2, the functor E can be alternatively defined by setting E(M)\nto be the subspace of M which is locally nilpotent under the action of h.\nThis gives rise to the following generalization of E: for any λ ∈ h∗\n(G, h) →Oc(G, h)λ by setting Eλ(M) to be the space of generalized eigenvectors of\nC[h∗]G in M with eigenvalue λ.\nb\nOc\nwe define the functor\nEλ :\nThis way, we have E0 = E.\nWe can also define the generalized Jacquet functor Jλ\nformula Jλ(M) = Eλ(M). Then we have J0\nJλ to Oc(G, h)λ is the identity functor.\n: Oc(G, h) →Oc(G, h)λ by the\n= J , and one can show that the restriction of\n5.5. The centralizer construction. For a finite group H, let eH = H -1\n| |\ng be the\ng∈H\nsymmetrizer of H.\nIf G ⊃ H are finite groups, and A is an algebra containing C[H], then define the algebra\nZ(G, H, A) to be the centralizer EndA(P ) of A in the right A-module P = FunH (G, A) of\nH-invariant A-valued functions on G, i.e. such functions f : G\nA that f(hg) = hf(g).\n→\nClearly, P is a free A-module of rank |G/H|, so the algebra Z(G, H, A) is isomorphic to\nMat|G/H|(A), but this isomorphism is not canonical.\nThe following lemma is trivial.\nLemma 5.3. The functor N 7→ I(N) := P ⊗A N = FunH (G, N) defines an equivalence of\ncategories A - mod\nZ(G, H, A) - mod.\n→\n\nd\nd\nX\nd\n5.6. Completion of rational Cherednik algebras at arbitrary points of h/G. The\nfollowing result is, in essence, a consequence of the geometric approach to rational Cherednik\nalgebras, described in Subsection 5.1. It should be regarded as a direct generalization to the\ncase of Cherednik algebras of Theorem 8.6 of [L] for affine Hecke algebras.\nLet b ∈ h. Abusing notation, denote the restriction of c to the set Sb of reflections in Gb\nalso by c.\nTheorem 5.4. One has a natural isomorphism\nH1,c\nd\nH\nH\n,c\n,c\nθ :\n(G, h)b → Z(G, Gb,\n(Gb, h)0),\ndefined by the following formulas. Suppose that f ∈ P = FunGb (G,\n(Gb, h)0). Then\n(θ(u)f)(w) = f(wu), u ∈ G;\nfor any α ∈ h∗,\n(b)\n(θ(xα)f)(w) = (xwα + (wα, b))f(w),\nwhere xα ∈ h∗ ⊂ H1,c(G, h), xα\n(b) ∈ h∗ ⊂ H1,c(Gb, h) are the elements corresponding to α; and\nfor any a ∈ h,\n2cs\nαs(wa)\n(b)\n(5.1)\n(θ(ya)f)(w) = ywaf(w) -\n(f(w) - f(sw)).\ns∈S:s/∈Gb 1 - λs xα\n(b\ns\n) + αs(b)\nwhere ya ∈ h ⊂ H1,c(G, h), ya\n(b) ∈ h ⊂ H1,c(Gb, h).\nProof. The proof is by a direct computation. We note that in the last formula, the fraction\nd\nαs(wa)/(xα\n(b\ns\n) + αs(b)) is viewed as a power series (i.e., an element of C[[h]]), and that only\nthe entire sum, and not each summand separately, is in the centralizer algebra.\n\nRemark. Let us explain how to see the existence of θ without writing explicit formulas,\nand how to guess the formula (5.1) for θ. It is explained in [E1] (see e.g. [E1], Section\n2.9) that the sheaf of algebras obtained by sheafification of H1,c(G, h) over h/G is generated\n(on every affine open set in h/G) by regular functions on h, elements of G, and Dunkl\noperators. Therefore, this statement holds for formal neighborhoods, i.e., it is true on the\nformal neighborhood of the image in h/G of any point b ∈ h. However, looking at the formula\nfor Dunkl operators near b, we see that the summands corresponding to s ∈S, s ∈/ Gb are\nactually regular at b, so they can be safely deleted without changing the generated algebra\n(as all regular functions on the formal neighborhood of b are included into the system of\ngenerators). But after these terms are deleted, what remains is nothing but the Dunkl\noperators for (Gb, h), which, together with functions on the formal neighborhood of b and\nthe group Gb, generate the completion of H1,c(Gb, h). This gives a construction of θ without\nusing explicit formulas.\nAlso, this argument explains why θ should be defined by formula (5.1) of Theorem 5.4.\nIndeed, what this formula does is just restores the terms with s / Gb that have been\n∈\npreviously deleted.\nThe map θ defines an equivalence of categories\nH1,c\nH1,c\nθ ∗ :\n(G, h)b - mod\nZ(G, Gb,\n→\n(Gb, h)0) - mod.\n\nd\nb\nc\nc\nd\n\nc\nc\nCorollary 5.5. We have a natural equivalence of categories\nψλ : Oc(G, h)λ →Oc(Gλ, h/hGλ )0.\nProof. The category Oc(G, h)λ is the category of modules over H1,c(G, h) which are finitely\ngenerated over C[h] and extend by continuity to the completion of the algebra H1,c(G, h)\nat λ. So it follows from Theorem 5.4 that we have an equivalence Oc(G, h)λ →Oc(Gλ, h)0.\nComposing this equivalence with the equivalence ζ : Oc(Gλ, h)0 →Oc(Gλ, h/hGλ )0, we obtain\nthe desired equivalence ψλ.\n\nRemark 5.6.

(i),(ii) are straightforward from the definitions. (iii) follows from (i),(ii), since the\ncompletion functors are exact.\n\n5.8. Parabolic induction and restriction functors for rational Cherednik algebras.\nTheorem 5.4 allows us to define analogs of parabolic restriction functors for rational Chered\nnik algebras.\nNamely, let b ∈ h, and Gb = G0. Define a functor Resb : Oc(G, h)0 →Oc(G0, h/hG0 )0 by\nthe formula\nResb(M) = (ζ\nE\nθ∗)(c\nI-1\nMb).\n*\n*\n*\nWe can also define the parabolic induction functors in the opposite direction. Namely, let\nN ∈Oc(G0, h/hG0 )0. Then we can define the object Indb(N) ∈Oc(G, h)0 by the formula\nIndb(N) = (Eb\nθ-1\nI)(ζ\\\n-1(N)0).\n* ∗ *\nProposition 5.11.\n(i) The functors Indb, Resb are exact.\n(ii) One has Indb(Resb(M)) = Eb(c\nMb).\nProof. Part (i) follows from the fact that the functor Eb and the completion functor b b are\nexact (see Proposition 5.10). Part (ii) is straightforward from the definition.\n\nTheorem 5.12. The functor Indb is right adjoint to Resb.\nProof. We have\nHom(Resb(M), N) = Hom((ζ\nE\nθ∗)(c\nI-1\nθ∗)(c\nI-1\nMb), N) = Hom((E\nMb), ζ-1(N))\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n= Hom((I-1\nθ∗)(c\nζ\\\n-1(N)0\nMb, (θ-1\nI)(ζ\\\n-1(N)0))\nMb),\n) = Hom(c\n*\n∗ *\n= Hom(M, (Eb\nθ-1\nI)(ζ\\\n-1(N)0)) = Hom(M, Indb(N)).\n* ∗ *\nAt the end we used Proposition 5.8.\n\nThen we can obtain the following corollary easily.\nCorollary 5.13. The functor Resb maps projective objects to projective ones, and the functor\nIndb maps injective objects to injective ones.\nWe can also define functors resλ : Oc(G, h)0 →Oc(G0, h/hG0 )0 and indλ : Oc(G0, h/hG0 )0 →\n(G, h)0, attached to λ ∈ h∗G0 , by\nOc\nreg\nresλ := + * Resλ *+, indλ := + * Indλ *+,\nwhere + is as in Subsection 5.3.\nCorollary 5.14. The functors resλ, indλ are exact. The functor indλ is left adjoint to resλ.\nThe functor indλ maps projective objects to projective ones, and the functor resλ injective\nobjects to injective ones.\nProof. Easy to see from the definition of the functors and the Theorem 5.12.\n\nWe also have the following proposition, whose proof is straightforward.\nProposition 5.15. We have\nindλ(N) = (J * ψ-1)(N),\nand\nresλ(M) = (ψλ *\nM),\nEλ)(c\nλ\nwhere ψλ is defined in Corollary 5.5.\n\nd\nd\nd\nc\nc\n5.9. Some evaluations of the parabolic induction and restriction functors. For\ngeneric c, the category Oc(G, h) is semisimple, and naturally equivalent to the category\nRepG of finite dimensional representations of G, via the functor τ 7→ Mc(G, h, τ). (If G is\na Coxeter group, the exact set of such c (which are called regular) is known from [GGOR]\nand [Gy]).\nProposition 5.16.\n(i) Suppose that c is generic. Upon the above identification, the\nfunctors Indb, indλ and Resb, resλ go to the usual induction and restriction functors\nbetween categories RepG and RepG0. In other words, we have\nResb(Mc(G, h, τ)) = ⊕ξ∈cnτξMc(G0, h/hG0 , ξ),\nG0\nand\nIndb(Mc(G0, h/hG0 , ξ)) = ⊕τ∈GbnτξMc(G, h, τ),\nwhere nτξ is the multiplicity of occurrence of ξ in τ|G0 , and similarly for resλ, indλ.\n(ii) The equations of (i) hold at the level of Grothendieck groups for all c.\nProof. Part (i) is easy for c = 0, and is obtained for generic c by a deformation argument.\nPart (ii) is also obtained by deformation argument, taking into account that the functors\nResb and Indb are exact and flat with respect to c.\n\nExample 5.17. Suppose that G0 = 1. Then Resb(M) is the fiber of M at b, while Indb(C) =\nPKZ , the object defined in [GGOR], which is projective and injective (see Remark 5.22). This\nshows that Proposition 5.16 (i) does not hold for special c, as PKZ is not, in general, a direct\nsum of standard modules.\n5.10. Dependence of the functor Resb on b. Let G0 ⊂ G be a parabolic subgroup. In\nthe construction of the functor Resb, the point b can be made a variable which belongs to\nthe open set hG0 .\nreg\nd\nG\nhreg\nh/G be the natural map (note that this map is an etale covering of the image with\nbe the formal neighborhood of the locally closed set hG0\nreg\nNamely, let\nin h, and let\nreg →\nd\nG\nh\nπ :\nH1,c\nbe the pullback of the sheaf H1,c,G,h under π. We can regard it as a sheaf of algebras over\nhG0 . Similarly to Theorem 5.4 we have an isomorphism\nreg\nthe Galois group NG(G0)/G0, where NG(G0) is the normalizer of G0 in G). Let\n(G, h)hG0\nreg\nH1,c\nH1,c\nwhere D(hG0 ) is the sheaf of differential operators on hG0 , and ⊗ˆ is an appropriate completion\nreg\nreg\nof the tensor product.\nThus, repeating the construction of Resb, we can define the functor\nRes : Oc(G, h)0 →Oc(G0, h/hG0 )0 Loc(hG0 ),\nreg\nwhere Loc(hG0 ) stands for the category of local systems (i.e. O-coherent D-modules) on hG0 .\nreg\nreg\nThis functor has the property that Resb is the fiber of Res at b. Namely, the functor Res is\ndefined by the formula\n(G0, h/hG0 )0)ˆ\nreg\n⊗D(hG0\nZ(G, G0,\nθ :\n(G, h)hG0\nreg\n),\n→\nRes(M) = (E\nI-1\nθ∗)(MhG0\nreg ),\n*\n*\nis the restriction of the sheaf M on h to the formal neighborhood of hG0\nreg\nwhere MhG0\nreg\n.\n\nRemark 5.18. If G0 is the trivial group, the functor Res is just the KZ functor from [GGOR],\nwhich we will discuss later. Thus, Res is a relative version of the KZ functor.\nRemark 5.19. Note that the object Res(M) is naturally equivariant under the group\nNG(G0)/G0.\nThus, we see that the functor Resb does not depend on b, up to an isomorphism. A similar\nstatement is true for the functors Indb, resλ, indλ.\nConjecture 5.20. For any b ∈ h, λ ∈ h∗ such that Gb = Gλ, we have isomorphisms of\nfunctors Resb ∼\n= indλ.\n= resλ, Indb ∼\nRemark 5.21. Conjecture 5.20 would imply that Indb is left adjoint to Resb, and that Resb\nmaps injective objects to injective ones, while Indb maps projective objects to projective\nones.\nRemark 5.22. If b and λ are generic (i.e., Gb = Gλ = 1) then the conjecture holds. Indeed,\nin this case the conjecture reduces to showing that we have an isomorphism of functors\nFiberb(M) ∼Fiberλ(M +)∗ (M ∈Oc\nSince both functors are exact functors to the\n=\n(G, h)).\ncategory of vector spaces, it suffices to check that dim Fiberb(M) = dim Fiberλ(M +). But this\nis true because both dimensions are given by the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial\nof M (characterizing the growth of M).\nIt is important to mention, however, that although Resb is isomorphic to Resb0 if Gb = Gb0 ,\nthis isomorphism is not canonical. So let us examine the dependence of Resb on b a little\nmore carefully.\nTheorem 5.16 implies that if c is generic, then\nRes(Mc(G, h, τ)) = ⊕ξMc(G0, h/hG0 , ξ) ⊗Lτξ,\nwhere Lτξ is a local system on hG0 of rank nτξ. Let us characterize the local system Lτξ\nreg\nexplicitly.\nProposition 5.23. The local system Lτξ is given by the connection on the trivial bundle\ngiven by the formula\nX\n2cs dαs\nr = d -\n(1 - s).\ns∈S:s/∈G0 1 - λs αs\nwith values in HomG0 (ξ, τ|G0 ).\nProof. This follows immediately from formula (5.1).\n\nDefinition 5.24. We will call the connection of Proposition 5.23 the parabolic KZ (Knizhnik-\nZamolodchikov) connection.\nExample 5.25. Let G = Sn and G0 = Sn1 × · · · × Snk with n1 + · · · + nk = n. In this case,\nthere is only one parameter c.\nLet h = Cn be the permutation representation of G. Then\nhG0 = (Cn)G0 = {v ∈ h v = (z1, . . . , z1, z2, . . . , z2, . . . , zk, . . . , zk)}.\n|\n|\n{z\n} |\n{z\n}\n|\n{z\n}\nn1\nn2\nnk\n\nX\nX\nQ\nX\nX\nThus, the parabolic KZ connection on the trivial bundle with fiber being a representation τ\nof Sn has the form\nX\nn1+X+np\nn1+X+nq\n···\n···\nd - c\ndzp - dzq (1 - sij ).\n1≤p<q≤k i=n1+\n+np-1+1 j=n1+\n+nq-1+1 zp - zq\n···\n···\nSo the differential equations for a flat section F (z) of this bundle have the form\n∂F\nX\nn1+···+np\nn1+···+nq\n(1 - sij )F\n= c\n.\n∂zp\nq=\np i=n1+···+np-1+1 j=n1+···+nq-1+1\nzp - zq\nSo F (z) = G(z)\n(zp - zq)cnpnq , where the function G satisfies the differential equation\np<q\n∂G\nX\nn1+···+np\nn1+···+nq\nsij G .\n∂zp\n= -c\nq6=p i=n1+···+np-1+1 j=n1+···+nq-1+1 zp - zq\nLet τ = V ⊗n where V is a finite dimensional space with dim V = N (this class of repre\nsentations contains as summands all irreducible representations of Sn). Let Vp = V ⊗np , so\nthat τ = V1 ⊗· · · ⊗ Vk. Then the equation for G can be written as\n∂G\nX ΩpqG\n∂zp\n= -c\nzp - zq\n,\np = 1, . . . , k,\nq=p\nPN\nwhere Ω =\nEs,t ⊗ Et,s is the Casimir element for glN (Ei,j is the N by N matrix with\ns,t=1\nthe only 1 at the (i, j)-th place, and the rest of the entries being 0).\nThis is nothing but the well known Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov system of equations of the\nWZW conformal field theory, for the Lie algebra glN , see [EFK]. (Note that the repre\nsentations Vi are \"the most general\" in the sense that any irreducible finite dimensional\nrepresentation of glN occurs in V ⊗r for some r, up to tensoring with a character.)\nThis motivates the term \"parabolic KZ connection\".\n5.11. Supports of modules. The following two basic propositions are proved in [Gi1],\nSection 6. We will give different proofs of them, based on the restriction functors.\nProposition 5.26. Consider the stratification of h with respect to stabilizers of points in G.\nThen the (set-theoretical) support SuppM of any object M of Oc(G, h) in h is a union of\nstrata of this stratification.\nProof. This follows immediately from the existence of the flat connection along the set of\npoints b with a fixed stabilizer G0 on the bundle Resb(M).\n\nProposition 5.27. For any irreducible object M in Oc(G, h), SuppM/G is an irreducible\nalgebraic variety.\nProof. Let X be a component of SuppM/G. Let M 0 be the subspace of elements of M\nwhose restriction to a neighborhood of a generic point of X is zero. It is obvious that M 0 is\nan H1,c(G, h)-submodule in M. By definition, it is a proper submodule. Therefore, by the\nirreducibility of M, we have M 0 = 0. Now let f ∈ C[h]G be a function that vanishes on X.\nThen there exists a positive integer N such that f N maps M to M 0, hence acts by zero on\nM. This implies that SuppM/G = X, as desired.\n\nPropositions 5.26 and 5.27 allow us to attach to every irreducible module M ∈Oc(G, h),\na conjugacy class of parabolic subgroups, CM ∈ Par(G), namely, the conjugacy class of the\nstabilizer of a generic point of the support of M. Also, for a parabolic subgroup G0 ⊂ G,\ndenote by X (G0) the set of points b ∈ h whose stabilizer contains a subgroup conjugate to\nG0.\nThe following proposition is immediate.\nProposition 5.28.\n(i) Let M ∈Oc(G, h)0 be irreducible. If b is such that Gb ∈ CM ,\nthen Resb(M) is a nonzero finite dimensional module over H1,c(Gb, h/hGb ).\n(ii) Conversely, let b ∈ h, and L be a finite dimensional module H1,c(Gb, h/hGb ). Then\nthe support of Indb(L) in h is X (Gb).\nLet FD(G, h) be the set of c for which H1,c(G, h) admits a finite dimensional representation.\nCorollary 5.29. Let G0 be a parabolic subgroup of G. Then X (G0) is the support of some\nirreducible representation from Oc(G, h)0 if and only if c ∈ FD(G0, h/hG0 ).\nProof. Immediate from Proposition 5.28.\n\nExample 5.30. Let G = Sn, h = Cn-1 . In this case, the set Par(G) is the set of partitions\nof n. Assume that c = r/m, (r, m) = 1, 2 ≤ m ≤ n. By a result of [BEG], finite dimensional\nrepresentations of Hc(G, h) exist if and only if m = n. Thus the only possible classes CM\nfor irreducible modules M have stabilizers Sm × · · · × Sm, i.e., correspond to partitions into\nparts, where each part is equal to m or 1. So there are [n/m] + 1 possible supports for\nmodules, where [a] denotes the integer part of a.\n5.12. Notes.

For any reflection hyperplane H ⊂ h, its pointwise stabilizer\nis a cyclic group of order mH . Fix a collection of nonzero constants q1,H , . . . , qmH -1,H which\nare G-invariant, namely, if H and H0 are conjugate to each other under some element in G,\nthen qi,H = qi,H0 for i = 1, . . . , mH - 1.\nLet BG = π1(hreg/G, x0) be the braid group of G, and TH ∈ BG be a representative of\nthe conjugacy class defined by a small circle around the image of H in h/G oriented in the\ncounterclockwise direction.\nThe following theorem follows from elementary algebraic topology.\nProposition 6.1. The group G is the quotient of the braid group BG by the relations\nTH\nmH = 1\nfor all reflection hyperplanes H.\nProof. See, e.g., [BMR] Proposition 2.17.\n\nDefinition 6.2. The Hecke algebra of G is defined to be\nmY\nH -1\nHq(G) = C[BG]/h(TH - 1)\n(TH - exp(2πij/mH )qj,H ), for all Hi.\nj=1\nThus, by Proposition 6.1 we have an isomorphism\n= CG.\nH1(G) ∼\nSo Hq(G) is a deformation of CG.\nExample 6.3 (Coxeter group case). Now let W be a Coxeter group. Let S be the set of\nreflections and let αs = 0 be the reflection hyperplane corresponding to s ∈S. The Hecke\nalgebra Hq(W ) is the quotient of C[BW ] by the relations\n(Ts - 1)(Ts + qs) = 0,\nfor all reflections s where Ts is a small counterclockwise circle around the image of the\nhyperplane αs = 0 in h/W .\n6.2. KZ functors. For a complex reflection group G, let Loc(hreg) be the category of local\nsystems (i.e., O-coherent D-modules) on hreg, and let Loc(hreg)G be the category of G\nequivariant local systems on hreg, i.e. of local systems on hreg/G.\nSuppose that G0 = 1 is the trivial subgroup in G. Then the restriction functor defined in\nSection 5.10 defines a functor Res : Oc(G, h)0 → Loc(hreg/G). Also, we have the monodromy\nfunctor Mon : Loc(hreg/G) ∼Rep(BG). The composition of these two functors is a functor\n=\nfrom Oc(G, h)0 to Rep(BG), which is exactly the KZ functor defined in [GGOR]. We will\ndenote this functor by KZ.\nTheorem 6.4 (Ginzburg, Guay, Opdam, Rouquier, [GGOR]). The KZ functor factors\nthrough\nRepHq(G), where\nmX\nH -1 c ` (1 - e2πij`/mH )\nqj,H = exp(2πibj,H /mH ),\nand bj,H = 2\nsH\n.\n1 - e-2πi`/mH\n`=1\n\nM\nM\nProof. Assume first that c is generic. Then the category Oc(G, h)0 is semisimple, with simple\nobjects Mc(τ), so it is enough to check the statement on Mc(τ). Consider the trivial bundle\nover hreg with fiber τ. The KZ connection on it has the form\nX 2cs dαs\nd -\n(1 - s).\n1 - λs αs\ns∈S\nThe residue of the connection form of this connection on the hyperplane H on the j-th\nirreducible representation of Z/mH Z is\nmX\nH -1\nc `\ns\n1 - e-2\nH\nπi`/mH (1 - e 2πij`/mH ).\n`=1\nTherefore, the monodromy operator around this hyperplane is diagonalizable, and the eigen\nvalues of this operator are 1 and exp(2πij/mH )qj,H , as desired.\nFor special c, introduce the generalized Verma module\nMc,n(τ ) = Hc(G, h) ⊗CGnSh (τ ⊗ Sh/m n+1),\nwhere m\nSh is the maximal ideal of 0, n\n0. Clearly, Mc,0 = Mc(τ). Moreover,\n⊂\n≥\nMc,n\n(G, h)0 for any n, since it has a finite filtration whose successive quotients are\n∈Oc\nVerma modules.\nTheorem 6.5. For large enough n, Mc,n(CG) contains a direct summand which is a projec\ntive generator of Oc(G, h)0.\nProof. From the definition, Mc,n = Sh∗ ⊗ CG ⊗ Sh/mn+1 . Let ∂ be the degree operator on\nMc,n(CG) with deg h∗ = 1, deg h = -1, and deg G = 0, i.e., we have\n[∂, x] = x, [∂, y] = -y, where x ∈ h∗, y ∈ h.\nSo h - ∂ is a module endomorphism of Mc,n(CG) where h is the operator defined in (3.2).\nMoreover, h - ∂ acts locally finitely. In particular, we have a decomposition of Mc,n(CG)\ninto generalized eigenspaces of h - ∂:\nMc,n(CG) =\nM β (CG).\nc,n\nβ∈C\nWe have\nHom(Mc,n(CG), N) = {vectors in N which are killed by m n+1},\nand\nHom(M β (CG), N) = {vectors in N which are killed by m n+1\nc,n\nand are generalized eigenvectors of h with generalized eigenvalue β}.\nLet\nΣ\nP =\n{hc(τ)|τ is a irreducible representation of G}\n(recall\nthat\nhc(τ) = dim h\n2cs s τ ), and let\n-\ns∈S 1-λs |\nM Σ (CG) =\nM β (CG).\nc,n\nc,n\nβ∈Σ\nClaim: for large n, M Σ (CG) is a projective generator of Oc(G, h)0.\nc,n\n\nProof of the claim. First, for any β, there exists n such that M Σ (CG) is projective (since\nc,n\nthe condition of being killed by mn+1 is vacuous for large n).\nSecondly, consider the functor Hom(M Σ (CG), -). For any module N ∈Oc(G, h)0, if\nc,n\nHom(M Σ (CG), N) = 0, then ⊕β∈ΣN[β] = 0. So N = 0. Thus this functor does not kill\nc,n\nnonzero objects, and so M Σ (CG) is a generator.\n\nc,n\nTheorem 6.5 is proved.\n\nCorollary 6.6.\n(i) Oc(G, h)0 has enough projectives, so it is equivalent to the category\nof modules over a finite dimensional algebra.\n(ii) Any object of Oc(G, h)0 is a quotient of a multiple of Mc,n(CG) for large enough n.\nProof. Directly from the definition and the above theorem.\n\nNow we can finish the proof of Theorem 6.4.\nWe have shown that for generic c,\nKZ(Mc,n(CG)) ∈ RepHq(G). Hence this is true for any c, since Mc,n(CG) is a flat fam\nily of modules over Hc(G, h). Then, KZ(M) is a Hq(G)-module for all M, since any M is a\nquotient of Mc,n(CG) and the functor KZ is exact.\n\nCorollary 6.7 (Brou e, Malle, Rouquier, [BMR]). Let qj,H = exp(tj,H ) where tj,H 's are\nformal parameters. Then Hq(G) is a free module over C[[tj,H ]] of rank |G|.\nProof. We have\nHq(G)/(t) = H1(G) = CG.\nSo it remains to show that Hq(G) is free. To show this, it is sufficient to show that any\nτ ∈ IrrepG admits a flat deformation τq to a representation of Hq(G). We can define this\ndeformation by letting τq = KZ(Mc(τ )).\n\nRemark 6.8. 1. The validity of this Corollary in characteristic zero implies that it is also\nvalid over a field positive characteristic.\n2. It is not known in general if the Corollary holds for numerical q (even generically). This\nis a conjecture of Brou e, Malle, and Rouquier. But it is known for many cases (including all\nCoxeter groups).\n3. The proof of the Corollary is analytic (it is based on the notion of monodromy). There\nis no known algebraic proof, except in special cases, and in the case of Coxeter groups, which\nwe'll discuss later.\n6.3. The image of the KZ functor. First, let us recall the definition of a quotient category.\nLet A be an abelian category and B ⊂A a full abelian subcategory.\nDefinition 6.9. B is a Serre subcategory if it is closed under subquotients and extensions\n(i.e., if two terms in a short exact sequence are in B, so is the third one).\nIf B ⊂A is a Serre subcategory, one can define a category A/B as follows:\nobjects in A/B = objects in A,\nHomA/B(X, Y ) =\nlim\nHomA(X0, Y/Y 0).\n-→\nY 0,X/X0∈B\nThe category A/B is an abelian category with the following universal property: any exact\nfunctor F : A →C that kills B must factor through A/B.\n\nNow let Oc(G, h)tor be the full subcategory of Oc(G, h)0 consisting of modules supported\non the reflection hyperplanes. It is a Serre subcategory, and ker(KZ) = Oc(G, h)tor\n0 . Thus\nwe have a functor:\nKZ : Oc(G, h)0/Oc(G, h)tor\nRepHq(G).\n0 →\nTheorem 6.10 (Ginzburg, Guay, Opdam, Rouquier, [GGOR]). If dim Hq(G) = |G|, the\nfunctor KZ is an equivalence of categories.\nProof. See [GGOR], Theorem 5.14.\n\n6.4. Example: the symmetric group Sn. Let h = Cn , G = Sn. Then we have (for\nq ∈ C∗):\nHq(Sn) = hT1, . . . , Tn-1i/hthe braid relations and (Ti - 1)(Ti + q) = 0i.\nThe following facts are known:\n(1) dim Hq(Sn) = n!;\n(2) Hq(Sn) is semisimple if and only if ord(q) = 2, 3, . . . , n.\nNow suppose q is generic. Let λ be a partition of n. Then we can define an Hq(Sn)\nmodule Sλ, the Specht module for the Hecke algebra in the sense of [DJ]. This is a certain\ndeformation of the classical irreducible Specht module for the symmetric group. The Specht\nmodule carries an inner product h·, ·i. Denote Dλ = Sλ/Radh·, ·i.\nTheorem 6.11 (Dipper, James, [DJ]). Dλ is either an irreducible Hq(Sn)-module, or 0.\nDλ = 0 if and only if λ is e-regular where e = ord(q) (i.e., every part of λ occurs less than\ne times).\nProof. See [DJ], Theorem 6.3, 6.8.\n\nNow let Mc(λ) be the Verma module associated to the Specht module for Sn and Lc(λ)\nbe its irreducible quotient. Then we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 6.12. If c ≤ 0, then KZ(Mc(λ)) = Sλ and KZ(Lc(λ)) = Dλ.\nProof. See Section 6.2 of [GGOR].\n\nCorollary 6.13. If c ≤ 0, then SuppLc(λ) = Cn if and only if λ is e-regular.

      "content": "7. Rational Cherednik algebras and Hecke algebras for varieties with\ngroup actions\n7.1. Twisted differential operators. Let us recall the theory of twisted differential oper\nators (see [BB], section 2).\nLet X be a smooth affine algebraic variety over C. Given a closed 2-form ω on X, the\nalgebra Dω(X) of differential operators on X twisted by ω can be defined as the algebra\ngenerated by OX and \"Lie derivatives\" Lv, v ∈ Vect(X), with defining relations\nfLv = Lfv, [Lv, f] = Lvf, [Lv, Lw] = L[v,w] + ω(v, w).\nThis algebra depends only on the cohomology class [ω] of ω, and equals the algebra D(X)\nof usual differential operators on X if [ω] = 0.\nAn important special case of twisted differential operators is the algebra of differential\noperators on a line bundle. Namely, let L be a line bundle on X. Since X is affine, L admits\nan algebraic connection r with curvature ω, which is a closed 2-form on X. Then it is easy\nto show that the algebra D(X, L) of differential operators on L is isomorphic to Dω(X).\nIf the variety X is smooth but not necessarily affine, then (sheaves of) algebras of twisted\ndifferential operators are classified by the space H2(X, Ω≥1), where Ω≥1 is the two-step com-\nX\nX\nplex of sheaves Ω1\nX\nΩX\n2,cl, given by the De Rham differential acting from 1-forms to closed\n→\n2-forms (sitting in degrees 1 and 2, respectively). If X is projective then this space is\nisomorphic to H2,0(X, C) ⊕ H1,1(X, C). We refer the reader to [BB], Section 2, for details.\nRemark 7.1. One can show that Dω(X) is the universal deformation of D(X) (see [E1]).\n7.2. Some algebraic geometry preliminaries. Let Z be a smooth hypersurface in a\nsmooth affine variety X. Let i : Z\nX be the corresponding closed embedding. Let\n→\nN denote the normal bundle of Z in X (a line bundle). Let OX (Z) denote the module\nof regular functions on X \\ Z which have a pole of at most first order at Z. Then we\nhave a natural map of OX -modules φ : OX (Z)\ni∗N. Indeed, we have a natural residue\nmap η :\nΩ1\nX → i∗OZ (where Ω1\n→\nis the module of 1-forms), hence a map\nOX (Z) ⊗OX\nX\nη0 : OX (Z) → i∗OZ ⊗OX TX = i∗(TX|Z ) (where TX is the tangent bundle). The map\nφ is obtained by composing η0 with the natural projection TX|Z → N.\nWe have an exact sequence of OX -modules:\nφ\n0 →OX →OX (Z) → i∗N\n-\n→\nThus we have a natural surjective map of OX -modules ξZ : TX →OX (Z)/OX .\n7.3. The Cherednik algebra of a variety with a finite group action. We will now\ngeneralize the definition of Ht,c(G, h) to the global case. Let X be an affine algebraic variety\nover C, and G be a finite group of automorphisms of X. Let E be a G-invariant subspace\nof the space of closed 2-forms on X, which projects isomorphically to H2(X, C). Consider\nthe algebra G n OT ∗X , where T ∗X is the cotangent bundle of X. We are going to define a\ndeformation Ht,c,ω(G, X) of this algebra parametrized by\n(1) complex numbers t,\n(2) G-invariant functions c on the (finite) set S of pairs s = (Y, g), where g ∈ G, and Y\nis a connected component of the set of fixed points Xg such that codimY = 1, and\n(3) elements ω ∈ EG = H2(X, C)G .\n\nP\nIf all the parameters are zero, this algebra will conicide with G n OT ∗X .\nLet t, c = {c(Y, g)}, ω ∈ EG be variables. Let Dω/t(X)r be the algebra (over C[t, t-1, ω])\nof twisted (by ω/t) differential operators on X with rational coefficients.\nDefinition 7.2. A Dunkl-Opdam operator for (X, G) is an element of Dω/t(X)r[c] given by\nthe formula\nX 2c(Y, g)\n(7.1)\nD := tLv -\n1 - λY,g\n· fY (x) · (1 - g),\n(Y,g)∈S\nwhere λY,g is the eigenvalue of g on the conormal bundle to Y , v ∈ Γ(X, T X) is a vector\nfield on X, and fY ∈OX (Z) is an element of the coset ξY (v) ∈OX (Z)/OX (recall that ξY\nis defined in Subsection 7.2).\nDefinition 7.3. The algebra Ht,c,ω(X, G) is the subalgebra of G n Dω/t(X)r[c] generated\n(over C[t, c, ω]) by the function algebra OX , the group G, and the Dunkl-Opdam operators.\nBy specializing t, c, ω to numerical values, we can define a family of algebras over C, which\nwe will also denote Ht,c,ω(G, X). Note that when we set t = 0, the term tLv does not become\n0 but turns into the classical momentum.\nDefinition 7.4. Ht,c,ω(G, X) is called the Cherednik algebra of the orbifold X/G.\nRemark 7.5. One has H1,0,ω(G, X) = G n Dω(X). Also, if λ 6= 0 then Hλt,λc,λω(G, X) =\nHt,c,ω(G, X).\nExample 7.6. X = h is a vector space and G is a subgroup in GL(h). Let v be a constant\nvector field, and let fY (x) = (αY , v)/αY (x), where αY ∈ h∗ is a nonzero functional vanishing\non Y . Then the operator D is just the usual Dunkl-Opdam operator Dv in the complex\nreflection case (see Section 2.5). This implies that all the Dunkl-Opdam operators in the\nsense of Definition 7.2 have the form\nfiDyi + a, where fi ∈ C[h], a ∈ G n C[h], and Dyi\nare the usual Dunkl-Opdam operators (for some basis yi of h). So the algebra Ht,c(G, h) =\nHt,c,0(G, X) is the rational Cherednik algebra for (G, h), see Section 3.1.\nThe algebra Ht,c,ω(G, X) has a filtration F - which is defined on generators by deg(OX ) =\ndeg(G) = 0, deg(D) = 1 for Dunkl-Opdam operators D.\nTheorem 7.7 (the PBW theorem). We have\ngrF (Ht,c,ω(G, X)) = G n O(T ∗X)[t, c, ω].\nProof. Suppose first that X = h is a vector space and G is a subgroup in GL(h). Then, as\nwe mentioned, Ht,c,ω(G, h) = Ht,c(G, h) is the rational Cherednik algebra for G, h. So in this\ncase the theorem is true.\nNow consider arbitrary X. We have a homomorphism of graded algebras\nψ : grF (Ht,c,ω(G, X)) → G n O(T ∗X)[t, c, ω]\n(the principal symbol homomorphism).\nThe homomorphism ψ is clearly surjective, and our job is to show that it is injective (this\nis the nontrivial part of the proof). In each degree, ψ is a morphism of finitely generated\nOG -modules. Therefore, to check its injectivity, it suffices to check the injectivity on the\nformal neighborhood of each point z ∈ X/G.\nLet x be a preimage of z in X, and Gx be the stabilizer of x in G. Then Gx acts on the\nformal neighborhood Ux of x in X.\nX\n\nLemma 7.8. Any action of a finite group on a formal polydisk over C is linearizable.\nProof. Let D be a formal polydisk over C. Suppose we have an action of a finite group G\non D. Then we have a group homomorphism:\nρ : G\nAut(D) = GLn(C) n AutU (D),\n→\nwhere AutU (D) is the group of unipotent automorphisms of D (i.e. those whose derivative\nat the origin is 1), which is a prounipotent algebraic group.\nOur job is to show that the image of G under ρ can be conjugated into GLn(C). The\nobstruction to this is in the cohomology group H1(G, AutU (D)), which is trivial since G is\nfinite and AutU (D) is prounipotent over C.\n\nIt follows from Lemma 7.8 that it suffices to prove the theorem in the linear case, which\nhas been accomplished already. We are done.\n\nRemark 7.9. The following remark is meant to clarify the proof of Theorem 7.7. In the case\nX = h, the proof of Theorem 7.7 is based, essentially, on the (fairly nontrivial) fact that the\nusual Dunkl-Opdam operators Dv commute with each other. It is therefore very important\nto note that in contrast with the linear case, for a general X we do not have any natural\ncommuting family of Dunkl-Opdam operators. Instead, the operators (7.1) satisfy a weaker\nproperty, which is still sufficient to validate the PBW theorem. This property says that if\nD1, D2, D3 are Dunkl-Opdam operators corresponding to vector fields v1, v2, v3 := [v1, v2]\nand some choices of the functions fY , then [D1, D2] - D3 ∈ G n O(X) (i.e., it has no poles).\nTo prove this property, it is sufficient to consider the case when X is a formal polydisk, with\na linear action of G. But in this case everything follows from the commutativity of the usual\nDunkl operators Dv.\nExample 7.10.\n(1) Suppose G = 1. Then for t = 0,\nHt,0,ω(G, X) = Dω/t(X).\n(2) Suppose G is a Weyl group and X = H the corresponding torus. Then H1,c,0(G, H)\nis called the trigonometric Cherednik algebra.\n7.4. Globalization. Let X be any smooth algebraic variety, and G ⊂ Aut(X). Assume\nthat X admits a cover by affine G-invariant open sets. Then the quotient variety X/G\nexists.\nFor any affine open set U in X/G, let U 0 be the preimage of U in X. Then we can\ndefine the algebra Ht,c,0(G, U 0) as above. If U ⊂ V , we have an obvious restriction map\nHt,c,0(G, V 0)\nHt,c,0(G, U 0). The gluing axiom is clearly satisfied. Thus the collection of\n→\nalgebras Ht,c,0(G, U 0) can be extended (by sheafification) to a sheaf of algebras on X/G. We\nare going to denote this sheaf by Ht,c,0,G,X and call it the sheaf of Cherednik algebras on\nX/G. Thus, Ht,c,0,G,X (U) = Ht,c,0(G, U 0).\nSimilarly, if ψ ∈ H2(X, Ω≥1)G , we can define the sheaf of twisted Cherednik algebras\nX\nHt,c,ψ,G,X . This is done similarly to the case of twisted differential operators (which is the\ncase G = 1).\nRemark 7.11.\n(1) The construction of Ht,c,ω(G, X) and the PBW theorem extend in a\nstraightforward manner to the case when the ground field is not C but an algebraically\nclosed field k of positive characteristic, provided that the order of the group G is\nrelatively prime to the characteristic.\n\nX\n(2) The construction and main properties of the (sheaves of) Cherednik algebras of alge\nbraic varieties can be extended without significant changes to the case when X is a\ncomplex analytic manifold, and G is not necessarily finite but acts properly discon\ntinuously. In the following lectures, we will often work in this generalized setting.\n7.5. Modified Cherednik algebra. It will be convenient for us to use a slight modification\nof the sheaf Ht,c,ψ,G,X . Namely, let η be a function on the set of conjugacy classes of Y such\nthat (Y, g) ∈S. We define Ht,c,η,ψ,G,X in the same way as Ht,c,ψ,G,X except that the Dunkl-\nOpdam operators are defined by the formula\nX\n2c(Y, g)\nX\n(7.2)\nD := tLv +\nfY (x)\n(g - 1) +\nfY (x)η(Y ).\n(Y,g)∈S\n1 - λY,g\nY\nThe following result shows that this modification is in fact tautological. Let ψY be the class\nin H2(X, Ω≥1) defined by the line bundle OX (Y )-1, whose sections are functions vanishing\nX\non Y .\nProposition 7.12. One has an isomorphism\nHt,c,η,ψ,G,X → Ht,c,ψ+ P\nY η(Y )ψY ,G,X .\nProof. Let y ∈ Y and z be a function on the formal neighborhood of y such that z|Y = 0\nand dzy = 0. Extend it to a system of local formal coordinates z1 = z, z2, . . . , zd near y. A\n∂\nDunkl-Opdam operator near y for the vector field ∂z can be written in the form\n∂\nn-1 2c(Y, gm)\nm\nD = ∂z + z (\n1 - λm (g - 1) + η(Y )).\nm=1\nY,g\nConjugating this operator by the formal expression zη(Y ) := (zm)η(Y )/m, we get\nn-1\n∂\n1 X 2c(Y, gm)\nz η(Y ) * D * z-η(Y ) = ∂z + z\n1 - λm (g m - 1)\nm=1\nY,g\nThis implies the required statement.\n\nWe note that the sheaf H1,c,η,0,G,X localizes to G n DX on the complement of all the\nhypersurfaces Y . This follows from the fact that the line bundle OX (Y ) is trivial on the\ncomplement of Y .\n7.6. Orbifold Hecke algebras. Let X be a connected and simply connected complex man\nifold, and G is a discrete group of automorphisms of X which acts properly discontinuously.\nThen X/G is a complex orbifold. Let X0 ⊂ X be the set of points with trivial stabilizer. Fix\na base point x0 ∈ X0. Then the braid group of X/G is defined to be BG = π1(X0/G, x0).\nWe have an exact sequence 1\nK\nBG → G\n1.\n→\n→\n→\nNow let S be the set of pairs (Y, g) such that Y is a component of Xg of codimension 1 in\nX (such Y will be called a reflection hypersurface). For (Y, g) ∈S, let GY be the subgroup of\nG whose elements act trivially on Y . This group is obviously cyclic; let nY = |GY |. Let CY\nbe the conjugacy class in BG corresponding to a small circle going counterclockwise around\nthe image of Y in X/G, and TY be a representative in CY .\nThe following theorem follows from elementary topology:\n\nY\nTheorem 7.13. K is defined by relations TY\nnY = 1, for all reflection hypersurfaces Y (i.e.,\nK is the intersection of all normal subgroups of BG containing TY\nnY ).\nProof. See, e.g., [BMR] Proposition 2.17.\n\nFor any conjugacy class of hypersurfaces Y such that (Y, g) ∈S we introduce formal\nparameters τ1Y , . . . , τnY Y . The entire collection of these parameters will be denoted by τ.\nLet A0 = C[G].\nDefinition 7.14. We define the Hecke algebra of (G, X), denoted A = Hτ (G, X, x0), to be\nthe quotient of the group algebra of the braid group, C[BG][[τ]], by the relations\nnY\n(7.3)\n(T - e 2πji/nY e τjY ) = 0, T ∈ CY\nj=1\n(i.e., by the closed ideal in the formal series topology generated by these relations).\nThus, A is a deformation of A0.\nIt is clear that up to an isomorphism this algebra is independent on the choice of x0, so\nwe will sometimes drop x0 form the notation.\nThe main result of this section is the following theorem.\nTheorem 7.15. Assume that H2(X, C) = 0. Then A = Hτ (G, X) is a flat formal defor\nmation of A0, which means A = A0[[τ ]] as a module over C[[τ]].\nExample 7.16. Let h be a finite dimensional vector space, and G be a complex reflection\ngroup in GL(h). Then Hτ (G, h) is the Hecke algebra of G studied in [BMR]. It follows\nfrom Theorem 7.15 that this Hecke algebra is flat. This proof of flatness is in fact the same\nas the original proof of this result given in [BMR] (based on the Dunkl-Opdam-Cherednik\noperators, and explained above).\nExample 7.17. Let h be a universal covering of a maximal torus of a simply connected\nsimple Lie group G, Q∨ be the dual root lattice, and Gb = G n Q∨ be its affine Weyl group.\nThen Hτ (h, Gb) is the affine Hecke algebra. This algebra is also flat by Theorem 7.15. In\nfact, its flatness is a well known result from representation theory; our proof of flatness is\nessentially due to Cherednik [Ch].\nExample 7.18. Let G, h, Q∨ be as in the previous example, η ∈ C+ be a complex number\nwith a positive imaginary part, and Gbb = G n (Q∨ ⊕ ηQ∨) be the double affine Weyl group.\nThen Hτ (h, Gbb) is (one of the versions of) the double affine Hecke algebra of Cherednik ([Ch]),\nand it is flat by Theorem 7.15. The fact that this algebra is flat was proved by Cherednik,\nSahi, Noumi, Stokman (see [Ch],[Sa],[NoSt],[St]) using a different approach (q-deformed\nDunkl operators).\n7.7. Hecke algebras attached to Fuchsian groups. Let H be a simply connected com\nplex Riemann surface (i.e., Riemann sphere, Euclidean plane, or Lobachevsky plane), and Γ\nbe a cocompact lattice in Aut(H) (i.e., a Fuchsian group). Let Σ = H/Γ. Then Σ is a com\npact complex Riemann surface. When Γ contains elliptic elements (i.e., nontrivial elements\n\nY\nY\nY\nof finite order), we are going to regard Σ as an orbifold: it has special points Pi, i = 1, . . . , m\nwith stabilizers Zni . Then Γ is the orbifold fundamental group of Σ.1\nLet g be the genus of Σ, and al, bl, l = 1, . . . , g, be the a-cycles and b-cycles of Σ. Let cj\nbe the counterclockwise loops around Pj . Then Γ is generated by al, bl, cj with relations\nnj\nb-1\ncj = 1,\ncm =\nalblal\n-1\nl .\nc1c2 · · ·\nl\nFor each j, introduce formal parameters τkj , k = 1, . . . , nj . Define the Hecke algebra Hτ (Σ)\nof Σ to be generated over C[[τ]] by the same generators al, bl, cj with defining relations\nnj\n(cj - e 2πji/nj\nl\nl\ne τkj ) = 0,\ncm =\nalbla-1b-1 .\nc1c2 · · ·\nk=1\nl\nThus Hτ (Σ) is a deformation of C[Γ].\nThis deformation is flat if H is a Euclidean plane or a Lobachevsky plane. Indeed, Hτ (Σ) =\nHτ (Γ, H), so the result follows from Theorem 7.15 and the fact that H2(H, C) = 0.\nOn the other hand, if H is the Riemann sphere (so that the condition H2(H, C) = 0 is\nviolated) and Γ = 1 then this deformation is not flat. Indeed, let\nτ = τ(~) be a 1-parameter\nsubdeformation of Hτ (Σ) which is flat. Let us compute the determinant of the product\nc1 · · · cm in the regular representation of this algebra (which is finite dimensional if H is the\nsphere). On the one hand, it is 1, as c1 · · · cm is a product of commutators. On the other\nhand, the eigenvalues of cj in this representation are e2πji/nj eτkj with multiplicity |Γ|/nj .\nComputing determinants as products of eigenvalues, we get a nontrivial equation on τkj (~),\nwhich means that the deformation Hτ is not flat.\nThus, we see that Hτ (Σ) fails to be flat in the following \"forbidden\" cases:\ng = 0, m = 2, (n1, n2) = (n, n);\nm = 3, (n1, n2, n3) = (2, 2, n), (2, 3, 3), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5).\nIndeed, the orbifold Euler characteristic of a closed surface Σ of genus g with m special\npoints x1, . . . , xm whose orders are n1, . . . , nm is\nm\nX 1\nχorb(Σ, x1, . . . , xm) = 2 - 2g - m +\n,\nni\ni=1\nand above solutions are the solutions of the inequality\nχorb(CP 1 , x1, . . . , xm) > 0.\n(note that the solutions for m = 1 and solutions (n1, n2) with n1 = n2 don't arise, since they\ndon't correspond to any orbifolds).\n1Let X be a connected topological space on with a properly discontinuous action of a discrete group G.\nThen the orbifold fundamental group of the orbifold X/G with base point x ∈ X, denoted πorb (X/G, x),\nis the set of pairs (g, γ), where g ∈ G and γ is a homotopy class of paths leading from x to gx, with\nmultiplication law (g1, γ1)(g2, γ2) = (g1g2, γ), where γ is γ1 followed by g1(γ2). Obviously, in this situation\nwe have an exact sequence\nπ1(X, x)\nπ1\norb (X/G, x)\nG\n1.\n→\n→\n→\n→\n\nP\n7.8. Hecke algebras of wallpaper groups and del Pezzo surfaces. The case when H\nis the Euclidean plane (i.e., Γ is a wallpaper group) deserves special attention. If there are\nelliptic elements, this reduces to the following configurations: g = 0 and\nm = 3, (n1, n2, n3) = (3, 3, 3), (2, 4, 4), (2, 3, 6) (cases E6, E7, E8),\nor\nm = 4, (n1, n2, n3, n4) = (2, 2, 2, 2) (case D4).\nIn these cases, the algebra Hτ (Γ, H) (for numerical τ) has Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 2,\nso it can be interpreted in terms of the theory of noncommutative surfaces.\nRecall that a del Pezzo surface (or a Fano surface) is a smooth projective surface, whose\nanticanonical line bundle is ample. It is known that such surfaces are CP1 × CP1, or a blow\nup of CP2 at up to 8 generic points. The degree of a del Pezzo surface X is by definition the\nself intersection number K K of its canonical class K. For example, a del Pezzo surface of\n·\ndegree 3 is a cubic surface in CP3, and the degree of CP2 with n generic points blown up is\nd = 9 - n.\nn-1\nNow suppose τ is numerical. Let ~ =\nj,k\nj τkj . Also let n be the largest of nj , and c\nbe the corresponding cj . Let e ∈ C[c] ⊂ Hτ (Γ, H) be the projector to an eigenspace of c.\nConsider the \"spherical\" subalgebra Bτ (Γ, H) := eHτ (Γ, H)e.\nTheorem 7.19 (Etingof, Oblomkov, Rains, [EOR]).\n(i) If ~ = 0 then the algebra Bτ (Γ, H)\nis commutative, and its spectrum is an affine del Pezzo surface. More precisely, in\nthe case (2, 2, 2, 2), it is a del Pezzo surface of degree 3 (a cubic surface) with a tri\nangle of lines removed; in the cases (3, 3, 3), (2, 4, 4), (2, 3, 6) it is a del Pezzo surface\nof degrees 3,2,1 respectively with a nodal rational curve removed.\n(ii) The algebra Bτ (Γ, H) for ~ =6\n0 is a quantization of the unique algebraic symplectic\nstructure on the surface from (i) with Planck's constant ~.\nProof. See [EOR].\n\nRemark 7.20. In the case (2, 2, 2, 2), Hτ (Γ, Γ) is the Cherednik-Sahi algebra of rank 1; it\ncontrols the theory of Askey-Wilson polynomials.\nExample 7.21. This is a \"multivariate\" version of the Hecke algebras attached to Fuchsian\ngroups, defined in the previous subsection. Namely, letting Γ, H be as in the previous\nsubsection, and N ≥ 1, we consider the manifold X = HN with the action of ΓN = SN nΓN .\nIf H is a Euclidean or Lobachevsky plane, then by Theorem 7.15 Hτ (ΓN , XN ) is a flat\ndeformation of the group algebra C[ΓN ]. If N > 1, this algebra has one more essential\nparameter than for N = 1 (corresponding to reflections in SN ). In the Euclidean case, one\nexpects that an appropriate \"spherical\" subalgebra of this algebra is a quantization of the\nHilbert scheme of a del Pezzo surface.\n7.9. The Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov functor. In this subsection we will define a global\nanalog of the KZ functor defined in [GGOR]. This functor will be used as a tool of proof of\nTheorem 7.15.\nLet X be a simply connected complex manifold, and G a discrete group of holomorphic\ntransformations of X acting on X properly discontinuously. Let X0 ⊂ X be the set of points\nwith trivial stabilizer. Then we can define the sheaf of Cherednik algebras H1,c,η,0,G,X on\nX/G. Note that the restriction of this sheaf to X0/G is the same as the restriction of the\n\nsheaf G n DX to X0/G (i.e. on X0/G, the dependence of the sheaf on the parameters c and\nη disappears). This follows from the fact that the line bundles OX (Y ) become trivial when\nrestricted to X0.\nNow let M be a module over H1,c,η,0,G,X which is a locally free coherent sheaf when\nrestricted to X0/G. Then the restriction of M to X0/G is a G-equivariant D-module on\nX0 which is coherent and locally free as an O-module. Thus, M corresponds to a locally\nconstant sheaf (local system) on X0/G, which gives rise to a monodromy representation of\nthe braid group π1(X0/G, x0) (where x0 is a base point). This representation will be denoted\nby KZ(M). This defines a functor KZ, which is analogous to the one in [GGOR].\nIt follows from the theory of D-modules that any OX/G-coherent H1,c,η,0,G,X -module is\nlocally free when restricted to X0/G. Thus the KZ functor acts from the abelian category\nCc,η of OX/G-coherent H1,c,η,0,G,X -modules to the category of representations of π1(X0/G, x0).\nIt is easy to see that this functor is exact.\nFor any Y , let gY be the generator of GY which has eigenvalue e2πi/nY in the conormal\nbundle to Y . Let (c, η)\nτ(c, η) be the invertible linear transformation defined by the\n→\nformula\nnX\nY -1\n1 - e2πjmi/nY\nτjY = 2πi(2\nc(Y, gY\nm)1 - e-2πmi/nY - η(Y ))/nY .\nm=1\nProposition 7.22. The functor KZ maps the category Cc,η to the category of representations\nof the algebra Hτ (c,η)(G, X).\nProof. The result follows from the corresponding result in the linear case (which we have\nalready proved) by restricting M to the union of G-translates of a neighborhood of a generic\npoint y ∈ Y , and then linearizing the action of GY on this neighborhood.\n\n7.10. Proof of Theorem 7.15. Consider the module M = IndGnDX OX . Then KZ(M)\nDX\nis the regular representation of G which is denoted by regG. We want to show that M\ndeforms uniquely (up to an isomorphism) to a module over H1,c,0,η,G,X for formal c, η. The\nobstruction to this deformation is in Ext2\n(M, M) and the freedom of this deformation\nGnDX\nis in Ext1\n(M, M). Since\nGnDX\nExti\n(M, M) = Exti (OX , ResM) = Exti\nGnDX\nDX\nDX (OX , OX ⊗ CG)\n= Exti (OX , OX ) ⊗ CG = Hi(X, C) ⊗ CG,\nDX\nand X is simply connected, we have\nExt1\n(M, M) = 0, and Ext2\n(M, M) = 0 if H2(X, C) = 0.\nGnDX\nGnDX\nThus such deformation exists and is unique if H2(X, C) = 0.\nNow let Mc,η be the deformation. Then KZ(Mc,η) is a Hτ (c,η)(G, X)-module from Propo\nsition 7.22 and it deforms flatly the module regG. This implies Hτ (c,η)(G, X) is flat over\nC[[τ ]].\nRemark 7.23. When X is not simply connected, the theorem is still true under the as\nsumption π2(X) ⊗ C = 0 (i.e. H2( e\nXe is the universal cover of X), and the\nX, C) = 0, where\nproof is contained in [E1].\n\n7.11. Example: the simplest case of double affine Hecke algebras. Now let G =\nZ2 n Z2 acting on C. Then the conjugacy classes of reflection hyperplanes are four points:\n0, 1/2, 1/2 + η/2, η/2, where we suppose the lattice in C is Z ⊕ Zη. Correspondingly, the\npresentation of G is as follows:\ngenerators: T1, T2, T3, T4;\nrelations: T1T2T3T4 = 1, Ti\n2 = 1.\nThus, the corresponding orbifold Hecke algebra is the following deformation of CG:\ngenerators: T1, T2, T3, T4;\nrelations: T1T2T3T4 = 1, (Ti - pi)(Ti - qi) = 0,\nwhere pi, qi (i = 1, . . . , 4), are parameters.\nIf we renormalize the Ti, these relations turn into\n(Ti - ti)(Ti + t-\ni\n1) = 0,\nT1T2T3T4 = q,\nand we get the type C∨C1 double affine Hecke algebra. If we set three of the four Ti's\nsatisfying the undeformed relation Ti\n2 = 1, we get the double affine Hecke algebra of type\nA1. More precisely, this algebra is generated by T1, . . . , T4 with relations\nT2\n2 = T3\n2 = T4\n2 = 1,\n(T1 - t)(T1 + t-1) = 0,\nT1T2T3T4 = q.\nAnother presentation of this algebra (which is more widely used) is as follows. Let E =\nC/Z2, an elliptic curve with an Z2 action defined by z 7→ -z. Define the partial braid group\nB = πorb(E\\{0}/Z2, x),\nwhere x is a generic point. Notice that comparing to the usual braid group, we do not\ndelete three of the four reflection points. The generators of the group π1(E \\ {0}, x) (the\nfundamental group of a punctured 2-torus) are X (corresponding to the a-cycle on the torus),\nY (corresponding to the b-cycle on the torus) and C (corresponding to the loop around 0). In\norder to construct B, which is an extension of Z2 by π1(E \\ {0}, x), we introduce an element\nT s.t. T 2 = C (the half-loop around the puncture). Then X, Y, T satisfy the following\nrelations:\nTXT = X-1 ,\nT -1Y T -1 = Y -1 ,\nY -1X-1Y XT 2 = 1.\nThe Hecke algebra of the partial braid group is then defined to be the group algebra of B\nplus an extra relation: (T - q1)(T + q2) = 0.\nA common way to present this Hecke algebra is to renormalize the generators so that one\nhas the following relations:\nTXT = X-1, T -1Y T -1 = Y -1, Y -1X-1Y XT 2 = q, (T - t)(T + t-1) = 0.\nThis is Cherednik's definition for H (q, t), the double affine Hecke algebra of type A1 which\ndepends on two parameters q, t.\nThere are two degenerations of the algebra H (q, t).\n1. The trigonometric degeneration.\nSet Y = e~y, q = e~ , t = e~c and T = se~cs, where s ∈ Z2 is the reflection. Then s, X, y\nsatisfy the following relations modulo ~:\ns 2 = 1,\nsXs-1 = X-1 ,\nsy + ys = 2c,\nX-1yX - y = 1 - 2cs.\nThe algebra generated by s, X, y with these relations is called the type A1 trigonomet\nric Cherednik algebra. It is easy to show that it is isomorphic to the Cherednik algebra\nH1,c(Z2, C∗), where Z2 acts on C∗ by z\nz-1 .\n→\n\nL\nL\n2. The rational degeneration.\nIn the trigonometric Cherednik algebra, set X = e~x and y = y/~.\ny satisfy the\nˆ\nThen s, x, ˆ\nfollowing relations modulo ~:\ns 2 = 1, sx = -xs, sˆ\nys, ˆ\ny = 1 - 2cs.\ny = -ˆ\nyx - xˆ\nThe algebra generated by s, x, yˆ with these relations is the rational Cherednik algebra\nH1,c(Z2, C) with the action of Z2 on C is given by z →-z.\n7.12. Affine and extended affine Weyl groups. Let R =\nbe a root system\n{α} ⊂ Rn\nwith respect to a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form (·, ) on Rn . We will assume that\n·\nR is reduced. Let {αi}n\ni=1 ⊂ R be the set of simple roots and R+ (respectively R-) be the\nset of positive (respectively negative) roots. The coroots are denoted by α∨ = 2α/(α, α).\nLet Q∨ =\nn\ni=1 Zα∨\ni be the coroot lattice and P ∨ =\nn\ni=1 Zωi\n∨the coweight lattice, where\nωi\n∨'s are the fundamental coweights, i.e., (ωi\n∨, αj ) = δij . Let θ be the maximal positive root,\nand assume that the bilinear form is normalized by the condition (θ, θ) = 2. Let W be the\nWeyl group which is generated by the reflections sα (α ∈ R).\nBy definition, the affine root system is\nRa = {α = [α, j] ∈ Rn × R| where α ∈ R, j ∈ Z}.\nThe set of positive affine roots is Ra = {[α, j]\nDefine α0 =\n+\n| j ∈ Z>0} ∪{[α, 0] | α ∈ R+}.\n[-θ, 1]. We will identify α ∈ R with α = [α, 0] ∈ Ra .\nFor an arbitrary affine root α = [α, j] and a vector z = [z, ζ] ∈ Rn × R, the corresponding\naffine reflection is defined as follows:\nsα ( z) = z - 2 (z, α) α = z - (z, α∨) α.\n(α, α)\nThe affine Weyl group W a is generated by the affine reflections {sα | α ∈ Re+}, and we have\nan isomorphism:\n= W n Q∨,\nW a ∼\nwhere the translation α∨ ∈ Q∨ is naturally identified with the composition s[-α,1]sα ∈ W a.\next\nDefine the extended affine Weyl group to be W a = W n P ∨ acting on Rn+1 via b( z) =\next\n[z, ζ -(b, z)] for z = [z, ζ], b ∈ P ∨. Then W a ⊂ W\n. Moreover, W a is a normal subgroup of\na\next\next\nW\nand W\n/W a = P ∨/Q∨. The latter group can be identified with the group Π = {πr} of\na\na\nthe elements of W\next\na permuting simple affine roots under their action in Rn+1 . It is a normal\ncommutative subgroup of Aut = Aut(Dyna) (Dyna denotes the affine Dynkin diagram).\nThe quotient Aut/Π is isomorphic to the group of the automorphisms preserving α0, i.e. the\ngroup AutDyn of automorphisms of the finite Dynkin diagram.\n7.13. Cherednik's double affine Hecke algebra of a root system. In this subsection,\nwe will give an explicit presentation of Cherednik's DAHA for a root system, defined in\nExample 7.18. This is done by giving an explicit presentation of the corresponding braid\ngroup (which is called the elliptic braid group), and then imposing quadratic relations on the\ngenerators corresponding to reflections.\nFor a root system R, let m = 2 if R is of type D2k, m = 1 if R is of type B2k, Ck, and\notherwise m = Π . Let mij be the number of edges between vertex i and vertex j in the\n| |\n\nY\nX\nY\naffine Dynkin diagram of Ra . Let Xi (i = 1, . . . , n) be a family of pairwise commutative and\nalgebraically independent elements. Set\nn\nn\nX[b,j] =\nXi\n`i qj, where b =\n`iωi ∈ P, j ∈ Z/mZ.\ni=1\ni=1\next\nFor an element wˆ ∈ W\n, we can define an action on these X[b,j] by ˆwX[b,j] = Xwˆ[b,j].\na\nDefinition 7.24 (Cherednik). The double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) of the root system\nR, denoted by H , is an algebra defined over the field Cq,t = C(q1/m, t1/2), generated by\nTi, i = 0, . . . , n, Π, Xb, b ∈ P , subject to the following relations:\n(1) TiTj Ti · · · = Tj TiTj · · · , mij factors each side;\n(2) (Ti - ti)(Ti + t-1) = 0 for i = 0, . . . , n;\ni\n(3) πTiπ-1 = Tπ(i), for π ∈ Π and i = 0, . . . , n;\n(4) πXbπ-1 = Xπ(b), for π ∈ Π, b ∈ P ;\n(5) TiXbTi = XbXα\n-\ni\n1 , if i > 0 and (b, α∨\ni ) = 1; TiXb = XbTi, if i > 0 and (b, αi\n∨) = 0;\n(6) T0XbT0 = Xb-α0 if (b, θ) = -1; T0Xb = XbT0 if (b, θ) = 0.\nHere ti are parameters attached to simple affine roots (so that roots of the same length\ngive rise to the same parameters).\nThe degenerate double affine Hecke algebra (trigonometric Cherednik algebra) HH trig is\next\nP n\ngenerated by the group algebra of W a , Π and pairwise commutative y b =\ni=1(b, α∨)yi + u\nfor b = [b, u] ∈ P × Z, with the following relations:\nsiyb - ysi(b)si = -ki(b, αi\n∨), for i = 1, . . . , n,\ns0yb - ys0(b)s0 = k0(b, θ),\nπrybπr\n-1 = yπr (b) for πr ∈ Π.\nRemark 7.25. This degeneration can be obtained from the DAHA similarly to the case of\nA1, which is described above.\n7.14. Algebraic flatness of Hecke algebras of polygonal Fuchsian groups. Let W\nbe the Coxeter group of rank r corresponding to a Coxeter datum:\nmij (i, j = 1, . . . , r, i =6\nj), such that 2 ≤ mij ≤inf and mij = mji.\nSo the group W has generators si i = 1, . . . , r, and defining relations\ns 2\ni = 1, (sisj )mij = 1 if mij =6\ninf.\nIt has a sign character ξ : W → {±1} given by ξ(si) = -1. Denote by W+ the kernel of ξ\n(the even subgroup of W ). It is generated by aij = sisj with relations:\n= a-1\nmij\naij\nji ,\naij ajkaki = 1,\naij\n= 1.\nWe can deform the group algebra C[W ] as follows. Define the algebra A(W ) with invertible\ngenerators si, and tij,k, i, j = 1, . . . , r, k ∈ Zmij for (i, j) such that mij < inf and defining\nrelations\ntij,k = t-1\nsi\n2 = 1,\n[tij,k, ti0j0,k0 ] = 0,\nsptij,k = tji,ksp,\nji,-k,\nmij\n(sisj - tij,k) = 0 if mij < inf.\nk=1\nNotice that if we set tij,k = exp(2πki/mij ), we get C[W ].\n\nY\nY\nY\nDefine also the algebra A+(W ) over R := C[tij,k] (tij,k = t-1 ) by generators aij , i = j\nji,-k\n(aij\nji ), and relations\n= a-1\nmij\n(aij - tij,k) = 0 if mij < inf,\naij ajpapi = 1.\nk=1\nIf w is a word in letters si, let Tw be the corresponding element of A(W ). Choose a\nfunction w(x) which attaches to every element x ∈ W , a reduced word w(x) representing x\nin W .\nTheorem 7.26 (Etingof, Rains, [ER]).\n(i) The elements Tw(x), x ∈ W , form a spanning\nset in A(W ) as a left R-module.\n(ii) The elements Tw(x), x ∈ W+, form a spanning set in A+(W ) as a left R-module.\n(iii) The elements Tw(x), x ∈ W , are linearly independent if W has no finite parabolic\nsubgroups of rank 3.\nProof. We only give the proof of (i). Statement (ii) follows from (i). Proof of (iii), which is\nquite nontrivial, can be found in [ER] (it uses the geometry of constructible sheaves on the\nCoxeter complex of W ).\nLet us write the relation\nmij\n(sisj - tij,k) = 0\nk=1\nas a deformed braid relation:\nsj sisj . . . + S.L.T. = tij sisj si . . . + S.L.T.,\nwhere tij = (-1)mij +1tij,1 · · · tij,mij , S.L.T. mean \"smaller length terms\", and the products\non both sides have length mij . This can be done by multiplying the relation by sisj · · · (mij\nfactors).\nNow let us show that Tw(x) span A(W ) over R. Clearly, Tw for all words w span A(W ).\nSo we just need to take any word w and express Tw via Tw(x).\nIt is well known from the theory of Coxeter groups (see e.g. [B]) that using the braid\nrelations, one can turn any non-reduced word into a word that is not square free, and any\nreduced expression of a given element of W into any other reduced expression of the same\nelement. Thus, if w is non-reduced, then by using the deformed braid relations we can reduce\nTw to a linear combination of Tu with words u of smaller length than w. On the other hand,\nif w is a reduced expression for some element x ∈ W , then using the deformed braid relations\nwe can reduce Tw to a linear combination of Tu with u shorter than w, and Tw(x). Thus Tw(x)\nare a spanning set. This proves (i).\n\nThus, A+(W ) is a \"deformation\" of C[W+] over R, and similarly A(W ) is a \"twisted\ndeformation\" of C[W ].\nNow let Γ = Γ(m1, . . . , mr), r ≥ 3, be the Fuchsian group defined by generators cj ,\nj = 1, . . . , r, with defining relations\nr\nc\nm\nj\nj = 1,\ncj = 1.\nj=1\nHere 2 ≤ mj < inf.\n\nY\nY\nP\nSuppose Γ acts on H where H is a simply connected complex Riemann surface as in\nSection 7.7. We have the Hecke algebra of Γ, Hτ (H, Γ), defined by the same (invertible)\ngenerators cj and relations\nr\n(cj - exp(2πik/nj )qjk) = 0,\ncj = 1,\nk\nj=1\nwhere qjk = exp(τjk).\nWe saw above (Theorem 7.15) that if τjk's are formal, the algebra Hτ (Γ, H) is flat in τ if\n|Γ| is infinite (i.e., H is Euclidean or hyperbolic). Here is a much stronger non-formal version\nof this theorem.\nTheorem 7.27. The algebra Hτ (Γ, H) is free as a left module over R := C[q±1] if and only\nP\njk\nif\n(1 - 1/mj ) ≥ 2 (i.e., H is Euclidean or hyperbolic).\nj\nProof. Let us consider the Coxeter datum: mij , i, j = 1, . . . , r, such that mi,i+1 := mi\n(i ∈ Z/rZ), and mij = inf otherwise. Suppose the corresponding Coxeter group is W . Then\nwe can see that Γ = W+. Notice that the algebra Hτ (Γ, H) for genus 0 orbifolds is the\nalgebra A+(W ), i.e., we have Hτ (Γ, H) = A+(W ).\nThe condition\n(1 - 1/mj ) ≥ 2 is equivalent to the condition that W has no finite\nj\nparabolic subgroups of rank 3. From Theorem 7.26 (ii) and Theorem 7.15, we can see that\nA+(W ) is free as a left module over R. We are done.\n\n7.15. Notes.

Rational Cherednik algebras for\nfinite Coxeter groups are a special case of a wider class of algebras called symplectic reflection\nalgebras. To define them, let V be a finite dimensional symplectic vector space over C with\na symplectic form ω, and G be a finite group acting symplectically (linearly) on V . For\nsimplicity let us assume that (∧2V ∗)G = Cω (i.e., V is symplectically irreducible) and that\nG acts faithfully on V (these assumptions are not important, and essentially not restrictive).\nDefinition 8.1. A symplectic reflection in G is an element g such that the rank of the\noperator 1 - g on V is 2.\nIf s is a symplectic reflection, then let ωs(x, y) be the form ω applied to the projections of\nx, y to the image of 1 - s along the kernel of 1 - s; thus ωs is a skewsymmetric form of rank\n2 on V .\nLet S ⊂ G be the set of symplectic reflections, and c : S → C be a function which is\ninvariant under the action of G. Let t ∈ C.\nDefinition 8.2. The symplectic reflection algebra Ht,c = Ht,c[G, V ] is the quotient of the\nalgebra C[G] n T(V ) by the ideal generated by the relation\n(8.1)\n[x, y] = tω(x, y) - 2\ncsωs(x, y)s.\ns∈S\nExample 8.3. Let W be a finite Coxeter group with reflection representation h. We can set\nV = h ⊕ h∗, ω(x, x0) = ω(y, y0) = 0, ω(y, x) = (y, x), for x, x0 ∈ h∗ and y, y0 ∈ h. In this case\n(1) symplectic reflections are the usual reflections in W ;\n(2) ωs(x, x0) = ωs(y, y0) = 0, ωs(y, x) = (y, αs)(α∨\ns , x)/2.\nThus, Ht,c[G, h ⊕ h∗] coincides with the rational Cherednik algebra Ht,c(G, h) defined in\nSection 3.\nExample 8.4. Let Γ be a finite subgroup of SL2(C), and V = C2 be the tautological\nrepresentation, with its standard symplectic form. Then all nontrivial elements of Γ are\nsymplectic reflections, and for any symplectic reflection s, ωs = ω. So the main commutation\nrelation of Ht,c[Γ, V ] takes the form\n[y, x] = t -\n2cgg.\ng∈Γ,g=1\nExample 8.5. (Wreath products) Let Γ be as in the previous example, G = Sn n Γn, and\nV = (C2)n . Then symplectic reflections are conjugates (g, 1, ..., 1), g ∈ Γ, g =6\n1, and also\nconmjugates of transpositions in Sn (so there is one more conjugacy class of reflections than\nin the previous example).\nNote also that for any V, G, H0,0[G, V ] = G n SV , and H1,0[G, V ] = G n Weyl(V ), where\nWeyl(V ) is the Weyl algebra of V , i.e. the quotient of the tensor algebra T(V ) by the\nrelation xy - yx = ω(x, y), x, y ∈ V .\n8.2. The PBW theorem for symplectic reflection algebras. To ensure that the sym\nplectic reflection algebras Ht,c have good properties, we need to prove a PBW theorem for\nthem, which is an analog of Proposition 3.5. This is done in the following theorem, which\nalso explains the special role played by symplectic reflections.\n\nX\nTheorem 8.6. Let κ : ∧2V → C[G] be a linear G-equivariant function. Define the algebra\nHκ to be the quotient of the algebra C[G]nT(V ) by the relation [x, y] = κ(x, y), x, y ∈ V . Put\nan increasing filtration on Hκ by setting deg(V ) = 1, deg(G) = 0, and define ξ : CG n SV →\ngrHκ to be the natural surjective homomorphism. Then ξ is an isomorphism if and only if κ\nhas the form\nκ(x, y) = tω(x, y) - 2\ncsωs(x, y)s,\ns∈S\nfor some t ∈ C and G-invariant function c : S → C.\nUnfortunately, for a general symplectic reflection algebra we don't have a Dunkl operator\nrepresentation, so the proof of the more difficult \"if\" part of this Theorem is not as easy\nas the proof of Proposition 3.5. Instead of explicit computations with Dunkl operators, it\nmakes use of the deformation theory of Koszul algebras, which we will now discuss.\n8.3. Koszul algebras. Let R be a finite dimensional semisimple algebra (over C). Let A\nbe a Z+-graded algebra, such that A[0] = R, and assume that the graded components of A\nare finite dimensional.\nDefinition 8.7.\n(i) The algebra A is said to be quadratic if it is generated over R by\nA[1], and has defining relations in degree 2.\n(ii) A is Koszul if all elements of Exti(R, R) (where R is the augmentation module over\nA) have grade degree precisely i.\nRemark 8.8.\n(1) Thus, in a quadratic algebra, A[2] = A[1] ⊗R A[1]/E, where E is the\nsubspace (R-subbimodule) of relations.\n(2) It is easy to show that a Koszul algebra is quadratic, since the condition to be\nquadratic is just the Koszulity condition for i = 1, 2.\nNow let A0 be a quadratic algebra, A0[0] = R. Let E0 be the space of relations for A0. Let\nE ⊂ A0[1] ⊗R A0[1][[~]] be a free (over C[[~]]) R-subbimodule which reduces to E0 modulo ~\n(\"deformation of the relations\"). Let A be the (~-adically complete) algebra generated over\nR[[~]] by A[1] = A0[1][[~]] with the space of defining relations E. Thus A is a Z+-graded\nalgebra.\nThe following very important theorem is due to Beilinson, Ginzburg, and Soergel, [BGS]\n(less general versions appeared earlier in the works of Drinfeld [Dr], Polishchuk-Positselski\n[PP], Braverman-Gaitsgory [BG]). We will not give its proof.\nTheorem 8.9 (Koszul deformation principle). If A0 is Koszul then A is a topologically free\nC[[~]] module if and only if so is A[3].\nRemark. Note that A[i] for i < 3 are obviously topologically free.\nWe will now apply this theorem to the proof of Theorem 8.6.\n8.4. Proof of Theorem 8.6. Let κ : ∧2V\nC[G] be a linear G-equivariant map. We write\nκ(x, y) = P\ng∈G κg(x, y)g, where κg(x, y) ∈ ∧\n→\n2V ∗. To apply Theorem 8.9, let us homogenize\nour algebras. Namely, let A0 = (CG n SV ) ⊗ C[u] (where u has degree 1). Also let ~ be a\nformal parameter, and consider the deformation A = H~u2κ of A0. That is, A is the quotient\nof G n T(V )[u][[~]] by the relations [x, y] = ~u2κ(x, y). This is a deformation of the type\nconsidered in Theorem 8.9, and it is easy to see that its flatness in ~ is equivalent to Theorem\n\nP\n8.6. Also, the algebra A0 is Koszul, because the polynomial algebra SV is a Koszul algebra.\nThus by Theorem 8.9, it suffices to show that A is flat in degree 3.\nThe flatness condition in degree 3 is \"the Jacobi identity\"\n[κ(x, y), z] + [κ(y, z), x] + [κ(z, x), y] = 0,\nwhich must be satisfied in CG n V . In components, this equation transforms into the system\nof equations\nκg(x, y)(z - zg) + κg(y, z)(x - xg) + κg(z, x)(y - yg) = 0\nfor every g ∈ G (here zg denotes the result of the action of g on z).\nThis equation, in particular, implies that if x, y, g are such that κg(x, y) = 0 then for any\ng\ng\ng\nz ∈ V z - z is a linear combination of x - x and y - y . Thus κg(x, y) is identically zero\nunless the rank of (1 - g)|V is at most 2, i.e. g = 1 or g is a symplectic reflection.\nIf g = 1 then κg(x, y) has to be G-invariant, so it must be of the form tω(x, y), where\nt ∈ C.\nIf g is a symplectic reflection, then κg(x, y) must be zero for any x such that x - xg = 0.\nIndeed, if for such an x there had existed y with κg(x, y) 6= 0 then z - zg for any z would\nbe a multiple of y - yg, which is impossible since Im(1 - g)|V is 2-dimensional. This implies\nthat κg(x, y) = 2cgωg(x, y), and cg must be invariant.\nThus we have shown that if A is flat (in degree 3) then κ must have the form given in\nTheorem 8.6. Conversely, it is easy to see that if κ does have such form, then the Jacobi\nidentity holds. So Theorem 8.6 is proved.\n8.5. The spherical subalgebra of the symplectic reflection algebra. The properties of\nsymplectic reflection algebras are similar to the properties of rational Cherednik algebras we\nhave studied before. The main difference is that we no longer have the Dunkl representation\nand localization results, so some proofs are based on different ideas and are more complicated.\nThe spherical subalgebra of the symplectic reflection algebra is defined in the same way\nas in the Cherednik algebra case. Namely, let e = |G|-1\ng∈G g, and Bt,c = eHt,ce.\nProposition 8.10. Bt,c is commutative if and only if t = 0.\nProof. Let A be a Z+-filtered algebra. If A is not commutative, then we can define a nonzero\nPoisson bracket on grA in the following way. Let m be the minimum of deg(a) + deg(b) -\ndeg([a, b]) (over a, b ∈ A such that [a, b] = 0). Then for homogeneous elements\na0, b0 ∈ A0 of\ndegrees p, q, we can define {a0, b0} to be the image in A0[p + q - m] of [a, b], where a, b are\nany lifts of a0, b0 to A. It is easy to check that {· , ·} is a Poisson bracket on A0 of degree\n-m.\nLet us now apply this construction to the filtered algebra A = Bt,c. We have gr(A) =\nA0 = (SV )G .\nLemma 8.11. A0 has a unique, up to scaling, Poisson bracket of degree -2, and no nonzero\nPoisson brackets of degrees < -2.\nProof. A Poisson bracket on (SV )G is the same thing as a Poisson bracket on the variety\nV ∗/G. On the smooth part (V ∗/G)s of V ∗/G, it is simply a bivector field, and we can lift\nit to a bivector field on the preimage Vs\n∗ of (V ∗/G)s in V ∗, which is the set of points in V\nwith trivial stabilizers. But the codimension on V ∗ \\ Vs\n∗ in V ∗ is 2 (as V ∗ \\ Vs\n∗ is a union\nof symplectic subspaces), so the bivector on Vs\n∗ extends to a regular bivector on V ∗. So if\n\nthis bivector is homogeneous, it must have degree ≥-2, and if it has degree -2 then it\nmust be with constant coefficients, so being G-invariant, it is a multiple of ω. The lemma is\nproved.\n\nNow, for each t, c we have a natural Poisson bracket on A0 of degree -2, which depends\nlinearly on t, c. So by the lemma, this bracket has to be of the form f(t, c)Π, where Π is the\nunique up to scaling Poisson bracket of degree -2, and f a homogeneous linear function.\nThus the algebra A = Bt,c is not commutative unless f(t, c) = 0. On the other hand, if\nf(t, c) = 0, and Bt,c is not commutative, then, as we've shown, A0 has a nonzero Poisson\nbracket of degree < -2. But By Lemma 8.11, there is no such brackets. So Bt,c must be\ncommutative if f(t, c) = 0.\nIt remains to show that f(t, c) is in fact a nonzero multiple of t. First note that f(1, 0) = 0,\nsince B1,0 is definitely noncommutative. Next, let us take a point (t, c) such that Bt,c is\ncommutative. Look at the Ht,c-module Ht,ce, which has a commuting action of Bt,c from the\nright. Its associated graded is SV as an (CG n SV, (SV )G)-bimodule, which implies that\nthe generic fiber of Ht,ce as a Bt,c-module is the regular representation of G. So we have a\nfamily of finite dimensional representations of Ht,c on the fibers of Ht,ce, all realized in the\nregular representation of G. Computing the trace of the main commutation relation (8.1) of\nHt,c in this representation, we obtain that t = 0 (since Tr (s) = 0 for any reflection s). The\nproposition is proved.\n\nNote that B0,c has no zero divisors, since its associated graded algebra (SV )G does not.\nThus, like in the Cherednik algebra case, we can define a Poisson variety Mc, the spectrum\nof B0,c, called the Calogero-Moser space of G, V . Moreover, the algebra Bc := B~,c over C[~]\nis an algebraic quantization of Mc.\n8.6. The center of the symplectic reflection algebra Ht,c. Consider the bimodule Ht,ce,\nwhich has a left action of Ht,c and a right commuting action of Bt,c. It is obvious that\nEndHt,c Ht,ce = Bt,c (with opposite product). The following theorem shows that the bimodule\nHt,ce has the double centralizer property (i.e., EndBt,c Ht,ce = Ht,c).\nNote that we have a natural map ξt,c : Ht,c → EndBt,c Ht,ce.\nTheorem 8.12. ξt,c is an isomorphism for any t, c.\nProof. The complete proof is given [EG]. We will give the main ideas of the proof skipping\nstraightforward technical details. The first step is to show that the result is true in the\ngraded case, (t, c) = (0, 0). To do so, note the following easy lemma:\nLemma 8.13. If X is an affine complex algebraic variety with algebra of functions OX and\nG a finite group acting freely on X then the natural map ξX : G n OX → EndOX OX is an\nG\nisomorphism.\nTherefore, the map ξ0,0 : G n SV\nEnd(SV )G (SV ) is injective, and moreover becomes an\n→\nisomorphism after localization to the field of quotients C(V ∗)G . To show it's surjective, take\na ∈ End(SV )G (SV ). There exists a0 ∈ G n C(V ∗) which maps to a. Moreover, by Lemma\n8.13, a0 can have poles only at fixed points of G on V ∗. But these fixed points form a subset\nof codimension ≥ 2, so there can be no poles and we are done in the case (t, c) = (0, 0).\nNow note that the algebra EndBt,c Ht,ce has an increasing integer filtration (bounded be\nlow) induced by the filtration on Ht,c. This is due to the fact that Ht,ce is a finitely generated\n\neHt,ce-module (since it is true in the associated graded situation, by Hilbert's theorem about\ninvariants). Also, the natural map grEndBt,c Ht,ce\nEndgrBt,c grHt,ce is clearly injective.\n→\nTherefore, our result in the case (t, c) = (0, 0) implies that this map is actually an iso\nmorphism (as so is its composition with the associated graded of ξt,c). Identifying the two\nalgebras by this isomorphism, we find that gr(ξt,c) = ξ0,0. Since ξ0,0 is an isomorphism, ξt,c\nis an isomorphism for all t, c, as desired. 2\n\nDenote by Zt,c the center of the symplectic reflection algebra Ht,c. We have the following\ntheorem.\nTheorem 8.14. If t = 0, the center of Ht,c is trivial. If t = 0, we have grZ0,c = Z0,0. In\nparticular, H0,c is finitely generated over its center.\nProof. The t = 0 case was proved by Brown and Gordon [BGo] as follows. If t = 0, we have\ngrZt,c ⊆ Z0,0 = (SV )G . Also, we have a map\nτt,c : Zt,c → Bt,c = eHt,ce,\nz 7→ ze = eze.\nThe map τt,c is injective since gr(τt,c) is injective. In particular, the image of gr(τt,c) is\ncontained in Z(Bt,c), the center of Bt,c. Thus it is enough to show that Z(Bt,c) is trivial. To\nshow this, note that grZ(Bt,c) is contained in the Poisson center of B0,0 which is trivial. So\nZ(Bt,c) is trivial.\nNow suppose t = 0. We need to show that gr(τ0,c) : gr(Z0,c)\nZ0,0 is an isomorphism. It\n→\nsuffices to show that τ0,c is an isomorphism. To show this, we construct τ0\n-\n,c\n1 : B0,c → Z0,c as\nfollows.\nFor any b ∈ B0,c, since B0,c is commutative, we have an element b ∈ EndB0,c (H0,ce) which\nis defined as the right multiplication by b. From Theorem 8.12, b ∈ H0,c. Moreover, b ∈ Z0,c\nsince it commutes with H0,c as a linear operator on the faithful H0,c-module H0,ce. So b ∈ Z0,c.\nIt is easy to see that be = b. So we can set b = τ0\n-\n,c\n1(b) which defines the inverse map to\nτ0,c.\n\n8.7. A review of deformation theory. Now we would like to explain that symplectic\nreflection algebras are the most general deformations of algebras of the from G n Weyl(V ).\nBefore we do so, we give a brief review of classical deformation theory of associative algebras.\n8.7.1. Formal deformations of associative algebras. Let A0 be an associative algebra with\nunit over C. Denote by μ0 the multiplication in A0.\nDefinition 8.15. A (flat) formal n-parameter deformation of A0 is an algebra A over\nC[[~]] = C[[~1, . . . , ~n]] which is topologically free as a C[[~]]-module, together with an\nalgebra isomorphism η0 : A/mA → A0 where m = h~1, . . . , ~ni is the maximal ideal in C[[~]].\nWhen no confusion is possible, we will call A a deformation of A0 (omitting \"formal\").\nLet us restrict ourselves to one-parameter deformations with parameter ~. Let us choose\nan identification η : A\nA0[[~]] as C[[~]]-modules, such that η = η0 modulo ~. Then the\n→\n2Here we use the fact that the filtration is bounded from below. In the case of an unbounded filtration,\nit is possible for a map not to be an isomorphism if its associated graded is an isomorphism. An example of\nthis is the operator of multiplication by 1 + t-1 in the space of Laurent polynomials in t, filtered by degree.\n\nproduct in A is completely determined by the product of elements of A0, which has the form\nof a \"star-product\"\nμ(a, b) = a ∗ b = μ0(a, b) + ~μ1(a, b) + ~2 μ2(a, b) + · · · ,\nwhere μi : A0 ⊗ A0 → A0 are linear maps, and μ0(a, b) = ab.\n8.7.2. Hochschild cohomology. The main tool in deformation theory of associative algebras\nis Hochschild cohomology. Let us recall its definition.\nLet A be an associative algebra. Let M be a bimodule over A. A Hochschild n-cochain of\nA with coefficients in M is a linear map A⊗n\nM. The space of such cochains is denoted\nby Cn(A, M). The differential d : Cn(A, M) →\n→\nCn+1(A, M) is defined by the formula\ndf(a1, . . . , an+1)\n= f(a1, . . . , an)an+1 - f(a1, . . . , anan+1) + f(a1, . . . , an-1an, an+1)\n-· · · + (-1)nf(a1a2, . . . , an+1) + (-1)n+1 a1f(a2, . . . , an+1).\nIt is easy to show that d2 = 0.\nDefinition 8.16. The Hochschild cohomology HH-(A, M) is defined to be the cohomology\nof the complex (C-(A, M), d).\nProposition 8.17. One has a natural isomorphism\nHHi(A, M)\nExti\n→\nA-bimod(A, M),\nwhere A-bimod denotes the category of A-bimodules.\nProof. The proof is obtained immediately by considering the bar resolution of the bimodule\nA:\n· · · → A ⊗ A ⊗ A → A ⊗ A → A,\nwhere the bimodule structure on A⊗n is given by\nb(a1 ⊗ a2 ⊗· · · ⊗ an)c = ba1 ⊗ a2 ⊗· · · ⊗ anc,\nand the map ∂n : A⊗n\nA⊗n-1 is given by the formula\n→\n∂n(a1 ⊗ a2 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = a1a2 ⊗· · · ⊗ an -· · · + (-1)n a1 ⊗· · · ⊗ an-1an.\nNote that we have the associative Yoneda product\nHHi(A, M) ⊗ HHj (A, N) → HHi+j (A, M ⊗A N),\ninduced by tensoring of cochains.\nIf M = A, the algebra itself, then we will denote HH-(A, M) by HH-(A). For example,\nHH0(A) is the center of A, and HH1(A) is the quotient of the Lie algebra of derivations of A\nby inner derivations. The Yoneda product induces a graded algebra structure on HH-(A); it\ncan be shown that this algebra is supercommutative.\n\nX\nX\n8.7.3. Hochschild cohomology and deformations. Let A0 be an algebra, and let us look for\n1-parameter deformations A = A0[[~]] of A0. Thus, we look for such series μ which satisfy\nthe associativity equation, modulo the automorphisms of the C[[~]]-module A0[[~]] which are\nthe identity modulo ~. 3\nThe associativity equation μ\n(μ ⊗ Id) = μ\n(Id ⊗ μ) reduces to a hierarchy of linear\n*\n*\nequations:\nN\nN\nμs(μN-s(a, b), c) =\nμs(a, μN-s(b, c)).\ns=0\ns=0\n(These equations are linear in μN if μi, i < N, are known).\nTo study these equations, one can use Hochschild cohomology. Namely, we have the\nfollowing standard facts (due to Gerstenhaber, [Ge]), which can be checked directly.\n(1) The linear equation for μ1 says that μ1 is a Hochschild 2-cocycle. Thus algebra struc\ntures on A0[~]/~2 deforming μ0 are parametrized by the space Z2(A0) of Hochschild\n2-cocycles of A0 with values in M = A0.\n(2) If μ1, μ0\n1 are two 2-cocycles such that μ1 - μ0\n1 is a coboundary, then the algebra struc\ntures on A0[~]/~2 corresponding to μ1 and μ0\n1 are equivalent by a transformation of\nA0[~]/~2 that equals the identity modulo ~, and vice versa. Thus equivalence classes\nof multiplications on A0[~]/~2 deforming μ0 are parametrized by the cohomology\nHH2(A0).\n(3) The linear equation for μN says that dμN is a certain quadratic expression bN in\nμ1, . . . , μN-1. This expression is always a Hochschild 3-cocycle, and the equation is\nsolvable if and only if it is a coboundary. Thus the cohomology class of bN in HH3(A0)\nis the only obstruction to solving this equation.\n8.7.4. Universal deformation. In particular, if HH3(A0) = 0 then the equation for μn can be\nsolved for all n, and for each n the freedom in choosing the solution, modulo equivalences,\nis the space H = HH2(A0). Thus there exists an algebra structure over C[[H]] on the space\nAu := A0[[H]] of formal functions from H to A0, a, b 7→ μu(a, b) ∈ A0[[H]], (a, b ∈ A0), such\nthat μu(a, b)(0) = ab ∈ A0, and every 1-parameter flat formal deformation A of A0 is given\nby the formula μ(a, b)(~) = μu(a, b)(γ(~)) for a unique formal series γ ∈ ~H[[~]], with the\nproperty that γ0(0) is the cohomology class of the cocycle μ1.\nSuch an algebra Au is called a universal deformation of A0. It is unique up to an isomor\nphism (which may involve an automorphism of C[[H]]). 4\nThus in the case HH3(A0) = 0, deformation theory allows us to completely classify 1\nparameter flat formal deformations of A0. In particular, we see that the \"moduli space\"\nparametrizing formal deformations of A0 is a smooth space - it is the formal neighborhood\nof zero in H.\nIf HH3(A0) is nonzero then in general the universal deformation parametrized by H does\nnot exist, as there are obstructions to deformations. In this case, the moduli space of\n3Note that we don't have to worry about the existence of a unit in A since a formal deformation of an\nalgebra with unit always has a unit.\n4In spite of the universal property of Au, it may happen that there is an isomorphism between the algebras\nA1 and A2 corresponding to different paths γ1(~), γ2(~) (of course, reducing to a nontrivial automorphism of\nA0 modulo ~). For this reason, sometimes Au is called a semiuniversal, rather than universal, deformation\nof A0.\n\nM\nM\nM\nO\ndeformations will be a closed subscheme of the formal neighborhood of zero in H, which\nis often singular. On the other hand, even when HH3(A0) =6\n0, the universal deformation\nparametrized by (the formal neighborhood of zero in) H may exist (although its existence\nmay be more difficult to prove than in the vanishing case). In this case one says that the\ndeformations of A0 are unobstructed (since all obstructions vanish even though the space of\nobstructions doesn't).\n8.8. Deformation-theoretic interpretation of symplectic reflection algebras. Let V\nbe a symplectic vector space (over C) and Weyl(V ) the Weyl algebra of V . Let G be a finite\ngroup acting symplectically on V . Then from the definition, we have\nA0 := H1,0[G, V ] = G n Weyl(V ).\nLet us calculate the Hochschild cohomology of this algebra.\nTheorem 8.18 (Alev, Farinati, Lambre, Solotar, [AFLS]). The cohomology space\nHHi(G n Weyl(V )) is naturally isomorphic to the space of conjugation invariant functions\non the set Si of elements g ∈ G such that rank (1 - g)|V = i.\nCorollary 8.19. The odd cohomology of G n Weyl(V ) vanishes, and HH2(G n Weyl(V ))\nis the space C[S]G of conjugation invariant functions on the set of symplectic reflections. In\nparticular, there exists a universal deformation A of A0 = G n Weyl(V ) parametrized by\nC[S]G .\nProof. Directly from the theorem.\n\nProof of Theorem 8.18.\nLemma 8.20. Let B be a C-algebra together with an action of a finite group G. Then\nHH∗(G n B, G n B) = (\nHH∗(B, Bg))G ,\ng∈G\nwhere Bg is the bimodule isomorphic to B as a space where the left action of B is the usual\none and the right action is the usual action twisted by g.\nProof. The algebra G n B is a projective B-module. Therefore, using the Shapiro lemma,\nwe get\nHH∗(G n B, G n B) = Ext∗\n(G×G)n(B⊗Bop)(G n B, G n B)\n= Ext∗\n(B, G n B) = Ext∗\n(B, G n B)G\nGdiagonaln(B⊗Bop)\nB⊗Bop\n= (\nExt∗\nB⊗Bop (B, Bg))G = (\nHH∗(B, Bg))G ,\ng∈G\ng∈G\nas desired.\n\nNow apply the lemma to B = Weyl(V ). For this we need to calculate HH∗(B, Bg),\nwhere g is any element of G. We may assume that g is diagonal in some symplectic basis:\ng = diag(λ1, λ1\n-1, . . . , λn, λn\n-1). Then by the K unneth formula we find that\nn\nHH∗(B, Bg) =\nHH∗(A1, A1gi),\ni=1\n\nwhere A1 is the Weyl algebra of the 2-dimensional space, (generated by x, y with defining\nrelation xy - yx = 1), and gi = diag(λi, λ-1).\ni\nThus we need to calculate HH∗(B, Bg), B = A1, g = diag(λ, λ-1).\nProposition 8.21. HH∗(B, Bg) is 1-dimensional, concentrated in degree 0 if λ = 1 and in\ndegree 2 otherwise.\nProof. If B = A1 then B has the following Koszul resolution as a B-bimodule:\nB ⊗ B → B ⊗ C2 ⊗ B → B ⊗ B → B.\nHere the first map is given by the formula\nb1 ⊗ b2 7→ b1 ⊗ x ⊗ yb2 - b1 ⊗ y ⊗ xb2 - b1y ⊗ x ⊗ b2 + b1x ⊗ y ⊗ b2,\nthe second map is given by\nb1 ⊗ x ⊗ b2 7→ b1x ⊗ b2 - b1 ⊗ xb2,\nb1 ⊗ y ⊗ b2 7→ b1y ⊗ b2 - b1 ⊗ yb2,\nand the third map is the multiplication.\nThus the cohomology of B with coefficients in Bg can be computed by mapping this\nresolution into Bg and taking the cohomology. This yields the following complex C-:\n(8.2)\nBg\nBg ⊕ Bg\nBg\n0,\n→\n→\n→\n→\nwhere the first nontrivial map is given by bg 7→ [bg, y] ⊗ x - [bg, x] ⊗ y, and the second\nnontrivial map is given by bg ⊗ x 7→ [x, bg], bg ⊗ y 7→ [y, bg].\nConsider first the case g = 1. Equip the complex C- with the Bernstein filtration (deg(x) =\ndeg(y) = 1), starting with 0, 1, 2, for C0, C1, C2, respectively (this makes the differential\npreserve the filtration). Consider the associated graded complex C- . In this complex,\ngr\nbrackets are replaced with Poisson brackets, and thus it is easy to see that C- is the De\ngr\nRham complex for the affine plane, so its cohomology is C in degree 0 and 0 in other degrees.\nTherefore, the cohomology of C- is the same.\nNow consider g = 1. In this case, declare that\nC0, C1, C2 start in degrees 2,1,0 respectively\n(which makes the differential preserve the filtration), and again consider the graded complex\nC- . The graded Euler characteristic of this complex is (t2 - 2t + 1)(1 - t)-2 = 1.\ngr\nThe cohomology in the C0 term is the set of b ∈ C[x, y] such that ab = bag for all a. This\ngr\nmeans that HH0 = 0.\ng\nThe cohomology of the C2 term is the quotient of C[x, y] by the ideal generated by a - a\ngr\n,\na ∈ C[x, y]. Thus the cohomology HH2 of the rightmost term is 1-dimensional, in degree 0.\nBy the Euler characteristic argument, this implies that HH1 = 0. The cohomology of the\nfiltered complex C- is therefore the same, and we are done.\n\nThe proposition implies that in the n-dimensional case HH∗(B, Bg) is 1-dimensional, con\ncentrated in degree rank (1 - g). It is not hard to check that the group G acts on the sum\nof these 1-dimensional spaces by simply permuting the basis vectors. Thus the theorem is\nproved.\n\nRemark 8.22. Another proof of Theorem 8.18 is given in [Pi].\nTheorem 8.23. The algebra H1,c[G, V ], with formal c, is the universal deformation of\nH1,0[G, V ] = G n Weyl(V ). More specifically, the map f : C[S]G → HH2(G n Weyl(V ))\ninduced by this deformation coincides with the isomorphism of Corollary 8.19.\n\nX\nP\nX\nProof. The proof (which we will not give) can be obtained by a direct computation with the\nKoszul resolution for G n Weyl(V ). Such a proof is given in [Pi]. The paper [EG] proves\na slightly weaker statement that the map f is an isomorphism, which suffices to show that\nH1,c(G, V ) is the universal deformation of H1,0[G, V ].\n\n8.9. Finite dimensional representations of H0,c. Let Mc = SpecZ0,c. We can regard\nH0,c = H0,c[G, V ] as a finitely generated module over Z0,c = O(Mc). Let χ ∈ Mc be a central\ncharacter, χ : Z0,c → C. Denote by hχi the ideal in H0,c generated by the kernel of χ.\nProposition 8.24. If χ is generic then H0,c/hχi is the matrix algebra of size |G|. In par\nticular, H0,c has a unique irreducible representation Vχ with central character χ. This repre\nsentation is isomorphic to CG as a G-module.\nProof. It is shown by a standard argument (which we will skip) that it is sufficient to check\nthe statement in the associated graded case c = 0. In this case, for generic χ, G n SV/hχi =\nG n Fun(Oχ), where Oχ is the (free) orbit of G consisting of the points of V ∗ that map to\nχ ∈ V ∗/G, and Fun(Oχ) is the algebra of functions on Oχ. It is easy to see that this algebra\nis isomorphic to a matrix algebra, and has a unique irreducible representation, Fun(Oχ),\nwhich is a regular representation of G.\n\nCorollary 8.25. Any irreducible representation of H0,c has dimension ≤|G|.\nProof. We will use the following lemma.\nLemma 8.26 (The Amitsur-Levitzki identity). For any N × N matrices X1, . . . , X2N with\nentries in a commutative ring A,\n(-1)σXσ(1) · · · Xσ(2N ) = 0.\nσ∈S2n\nProof. Consider the ring MatN (A) ⊗∧(ξ1, . . . , ξ2n). Let X =\ni Xiξi ∈ R. So we have\nX2 =\n[Xi, Xj ]ξiξj ∈ MatN (A ⊗∧even(ξ1, . . . , ξ2n)).\ni<j\nIt is obvious that Tr X2 = 0. Similarly, one can easily show that Tr X4 = 0, . . . , Tr X2N = 0.\nSince the ring A ⊗∧even(ξ1, . . . , ξ2n) is commutative, from the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we\nknow that X2N = 0 which implies the lemma.\n\nSince for generic χ the algebra H0,c/hχi is a matrix algebra, the algebra H0,c satisfies the\nAmitsur-Levitzki identity. Next, note that since H0,c is a finitely generated Z0,c-module (by\npassing to the associated graded and using Hilbert's theorem), every irreducible representa\ntion of H0,c is finite dimensional. If H0,c had an irreducible representation E of dimension\nm > |G|, then by the density theorem the matrix algebra Matm would be a quotient of\nH0,c. But one can show that the Amitsur-Levitzki identity of degree |G| is not satisfied for\nmatrices of bigger size than |G|. Contradiction. Thus, dim E ≤|G|, as desired.\n\nIn general, for special central characters there are representations of H0,c of dimension less\nthan |G|. However, in some cases one can show that all irreducible representations have\ndimension exactly G . For example, we have the following result.\n| |\n\nTheorem 8.27. Let G = Sn, V = h ⊕ h∗, h = Cn (the rational Cherednik algebra for Sn).\nThen for c = 0, every irreducible representation of H0,c has dimension n! and is isomorphic\nto the regular representation of Sn.\nProof. Let E be an irreducible representation of H0,c. Let us calculate the trace in E of any\npermutation σ = 1. Let j be an index such that σ(j) = i = j. Then sij σ(j) = j. Hence in\nH0,c we have\n[yj , xisij σ] = [yj, xi]sij σ = csij\n2 σ = cσ.\nHence Tr E (σ) = 0, and thus E is a multiple of the regular representation of Sn. But by\nTheorem 8.25, dim E ≤ n!, so we get that E is the regular representation, as desired.\n\n8.10. Azumaya algebras. Let Z be a finitely generated commutative algebra over C, M =\nSpecZ the corresponding affine scheme, and A a finitely generated Z-algebra.\nDefinition 8.28. A is said to be an Azumaya algebra of degree N if the completion Aˆχ of\nA at every maximal ideal χ in Z is the matrix algebra of size N over the completion Zˆχ of\nZ.\nThus, an Azumaya algebra should be thought of as a bundle of matrix algebras on M. 5\nFor example, if E is an algebraic vector bundle on M then End(E) is an Azumaya algebra.\nHowever, not all Azumaya algebras are of this form.\nExample 8.29. For q ∈ C∗, consider the quantum torus\nTq = ChX±1, Y ±1i/hXY - qY Xi.\nIf q is a root of unity of order N, then the center of Tq is hX±N , Y ±N i = C[M] where\nM = (C∗)2 . It is not difficult to show that Tq is an Azumaya algebra of degree N, but\nTq ⊗C[M] C(M) ∼6= MatN (C(M)), so Tq is not the endomorphism algebra of a vector bundle.\nExample 8.30. Let X be a smooth irreducible variety over a field of characteristic p. Then\nD(X), the algebra of differential operators on X, is an Azumaya algebra with rank pdim X ,\nwhich is not an endomorphism algebra of a vector bundle. Its center is Z = O(T ∗X)F, the\nFrobenius twisted functions on T ∗X.\nIt is clear that if A is an Azumaya algebra (say, over C) then for every central character\nχ of A, A/hχi is the algebra MatN (C) of complex N by N matrices, and every irreducible\nrepresentation of A has dimension N.\nThe following important result is due to M. Artin.\nTheorem 8.31. Let A be a finitely generated (over C) polynomial identity (PI) algebra of\ndegree N (i.e. all the polynomial relations of the matrix algebra of size N are satisfied in\nA). Then A is an Azumaya algebra if and only if every irreducible representation of A has\ndimension exactly N.\nProof. See [Ar] Theorem 8.3.\n\n5If M is not affine, one can define, in a standard manner, the notion of a sheaf of Azumaya algebras on\nM.\n\nThus, by Theorem 8.27, for G = Sn, the rational Cherednik algebra H0,c(Sn, Cn) for c = 0\nis an Azumaya algebra of degree n!. Indeed, this algebra is PI of degree n! because the clas\nsical Dunkl representation embeds it into matrices of size n! over C(x1, . . . , xn, p1, . . . , pn)Sn .\nLet us say that χ ∈ M is an Azumaya point if for some affine neighborhood U of χ the\nlocalization of A to U is an Azumaya algebra. Obviously, the set Az(M) of Azumaya points\nof M is open.\nNow we come back to the study the space Mc corresponding to a symplectic reflection\nalgebra H0,c.\nTheorem 8.32. The set Az(Mc) coincides with the set of smooth points of Mc.\nThe proof of this theorem is given in the following two subsections.\nCorollary 8.33. If G = Sn and V = h ⊕ h∗, h = Cn (the rational Cherednik algebra case)\nthen Mc is a smooth algebraic variety for c = 0.\nProof. Directly from the above theorem.\n\n8.11. Cohen-Macaulay property and homological dimension. To prove Theorem 8.32,\nwe will need some commutative algebra tools. Let Z be a finitely generated commutative\nalgebra over C without zero divisors. By Noether's normalization lemma, there exist ele\nments z1, . . . , zn ∈ Z which are algebraically independent, such that Z is a finitely generated\nmodule over C[z1, . . . , zn].\nDefinition 8.34. The algebra Z (or the variety SpecZ) is said to be Cohen-Macaulay if Z\nis a locally free (=projective) module over C[z1, . . . , zn]. 6\nRemark 8.35. It was shown by Serre that if Z is locally free over C[z1, . . . , zn] for some\nchoice of z1, . . . , zn, then it happens for any choice of them (such that Z is finitely generated\nas a module over C[z1, . . . , zn]).\nRemark 8.36. Another definition of the Cohen-Macaulay property is that the dualizing\ncomplex ωZ\n- of Z is concentrated in degree zero. We will not discuss this definition here.\nIt can be shown that the Cohen-Macaulay property is stable under localization. Therefore,\nit makes sense to make the following definition.\nDefinition 8.37. An algebraic variety X is Cohen-Macaulay if the algebra of functions on\nevery affine open set in X is Cohen-Macaulay.\nLet Z be a finitely generated commutative algebra over C without zero divisors, and let\nM be a finitely generated module over Z.\nDefinition 8.38. M is said to be Cohen-Macaulay if for some algebraically independent\nz1, . . . , zn ∈ Z such that Z is finitely generated over C[z1, . . . , zn], M is locally free over\nC[z1, . . . , zn].\nAgain, if this happens for some z1, . . . , zn, then it happens for any of them. We also\nnote that M can be Cohen-Macaulay without Z being Cohen-Macaulay, and that Z is a\nCohen-Macaulay algebra iff it is a Cohen-Macaulay module over itself.\nWe will need the following standard properties of Cohen-Macaulay algebras and modules.\n6It was proved by Quillen that a locally free module over a polynomial algebra is free; this is a difficult\ntheorem, which will not be needed here.\n\nTheorem 8.39.\n(i) Let Z1 ⊂ Z2 be a finite extension of finitely generated commutative\nC-algebras, without zero divisors, and M be a finitely generated module over Z2. Then\nM is Cohen-Macaulay over Z2 iff it is Cohen-Macaulay over Z1.\n(ii) Suppose that Z is the algebra of functions on a smooth affine variety. Then a Z-\nmodule M is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if it is projective.\nProof. The proof can be found in the text book [Ei].\n\nIn particular, this shows that the algebra of functions on a smooth affine variety is Cohen-\nMacaulay. Algebras of functions on many singular varieties are also Cohen-Macaulay.\nExample 8.40. The algebra of regular functions on the cone xy = z2 is Cohen-Macaulay.\nThis algebra can be identified as C[a, b]Z2 by letting x = a , y = b2 and z = ab, where the Z2\naction is defined by a 7→ -a, b 7→ -b. It contains a subalgebra C[a2, b2], and as a module\nover this subalgebra, it is free of rank 2 with generators 1, ab.\nExample 8.41. Any irreducible affine algebraic curve is Cohen-Macaulay. For example, the\nalgebra of regular functions on y2 = x3 is isomorphic to the subalgebra of C[t] spanned by\n1, t2, t3 , . . .. It contains a subalgebra C[t2] and as a module over this subalgebra, it is free of\nrank 2 with generators 1, t3 .\nExample 8.42. Consider the subalgebra in C[x, y] spanned by 1 and xiyj with i+j ≥ 2. It is\na finite generated module over C[x2, y2], but not free. So this algebra is not Cohen-Macaulay.\nAnother tool we will need is homological dimension. We will say that an algebra A has\nhomological dimension ≤ d if any (left) A-module M has a projective resolution of length\n≤ d. The homological dimension of A is the smallest integer having this property. If such\nan integer does not exist, A is said to have infinite homological dimension.\nIt is easy to show that the homological dimension of A is ≤ d if and only if for any A-\nmodules M, N one has Exti(M, N) = 0 for i > d. Also, the homological dimension clearly\ndoes not decrease under taking associated graded of the algebra under a positive filtration\n(this is clear from considering the spectral sequence attached to the filtration).\nIt follows immediately from this definition that homological dimension is Morita invariant.\nNamely, recall that a Morita equivalence between algebras A and B is an equivalence of\ncategories A-mod\nB-mod. Such an equivalence maps projective modules to projective\n→\nones, since projectivity is a categorical property (P is projective if and only if the functor\nHom(P, ) is exact). This implies that if A and B are Morita equivalent then their homological\n·\ndimensions are the same.\nThen we have the following important theorem.\nTheorem 8.43. The homological dimension of a commutative finitely generated C-algebra\nZ is finite if and only if Z is regular, i.e. is the algebra of functions on a smooth affine\nvariety.\n8.12. Proof of Theorem 8.32. First let us show that any smooth point χ of Mc is an\nAzumaya point. Since H0,c = EndB0,c H0,ce = EndZ0,c (H0,ce), it is sufficient to show that\nthe coherent sheaf on Mc corresponding to the module H0,ce is a vector bundle near χ. By\nTheorem 8.39 (ii), for this it suffices to show that H0,ce is a Cohen-Macaulay Z0,c-module.\nTo do so, first note that the statement is true for c = 0. Indeed, in this case the claim is\nthat SV is a Cohen-Macaulay module over (SV )G . But SV is a polynomial algebra, which\nis Cohen-Macaulay, so the result follows from Theorem 8.39, (i).\n\nNow, we claim that if Z, M are positively filtered and grM is a Cohen-Macaulay grZ\nmodule then M is a Cohen-Macaulay Z-module. Indeed, let z1, . . . , zn be homogeneous\nalgebraically independent elements of grZ such that grZ is a finite module over the subalge\nbra generated by them. Let z1\n0 , . . . , zn\n0 be their liftings to Z. Then z1\n0 , . . . , zn\n0 are algebraically\nindependent, and the module M over C[z1\n0 , . . . , zn\n0 ] is finitely generated and (locally) free since\nso is the module grM over C[z1, . . . , zn].\nRecall now that grH0,ce = SV , grZ0,c = (SV )G . Thus the c = 0 case implies the general\ncase, and we are done.\nNow let us show that any Azumaya point of Mc is smooth. Let U be an affine open set\nin Mc consisting of Azumaya points. Then the localization H0,c(U) := H0,c ⊗Z0,c OU is an\nAzumaya algebra. Moreover, for any χ ∈ U, the unique irreducible representation of H0,c(U)\nwith central character χ is the regular representation of G (since this holds for generic χ by\nProposition 8.24). This means that e is a rank 1 idempotent in H0,c(U)/hχi for all χ. In\nparticular, H0,c(U)e is a vector bundle on U. Thus the functor F : OU -mod\nH0,c(U)-mod\n→\ngiven by the formula F (Y ) = H0,c(U)e ⊗OU Y is an equivalence of categories (the quasi-\ninverse functor is given by the formula F -1(N) = eN). Thus H0,c(U) is Morita equivalent\nto OU , and therefore their homological dimensions are the same.\nOn the other hand, the homological dimension of H0,c is finite (in fact, it equals to dim V ).\nTo show this, note that by the Hilbert syzygies theorem, the homological dimension of\nSV is dim V . Hence, so is the homological dimension of G n SV (as Ext∗\n(M, N) =\nGnSV\nExt∗\nSV (M, N)G). Thus, since grH0,c = G n SV , we get that H0,c has homological dimension\n≤ dim V . Hence, the homological dimension of H0,c(U) is also ≤ dim V (as the homological\ndimension clearly does not increase under the localization). But H0,c(U) is Morita equivalent\nto OU , so OU has a finite homological dimension. By Theorem 8.43, this implies that U\nconsists of smooth points.\nCorollary 8.44. Az(Mc) is also the set of points at which the Poisson structure of Mc is\nsymplectic.\nProof. The variety Mc is symplectic outside of a subset of codimension 2, because so is M0.\nThus the set S of smooth points of Mc where the top exterior power of the Poisson bivector\nvanishes is of codimension ≥ 2. Since the top exterior power of the Poisson bivector is locally\na regular function, this implies that S is empty. Thus, every smooth point is symplectic, and\nthe corollary follows from the theorem.\n\n8.13. Notes.

      "content": "9. Calogero-Moser spaces\n9.1. Hamiltonian reduction along an orbit. Let M be an affine algebraic variety and\nG a reductive algebraic group. Suppose M is Poisson and the action of G preserves the\nPoisson structure. Let g be the Lie algebra of G and g∗ the dual of g. Let μ : M → g∗ be a\nmoment map for this action (we assume it exists). It induces a map μ∗ : Sg → C[M].\nLet O be a closed coadjoint orbit of G, IO be the ideal in Sg corresponding to O, and let\nJO be the ideal in C[M] generated by μ∗(IO). Then JG is a Poisson ideal in C[M]G, and\nO\nA = C[M]G/JG is a Poisson algebra.\nO\nGeometrically, Spec(A) = μ-1(O)/G (categorical quotient). It can also be written as\nμ-1(z)/Gz, where z ∈ O and Gz is the stabilizer of z in G.\nDefinition 9.1. The scheme μ-1(O)/G is called the Hamiltonian reduction of M with respect\nto G along O. We will denote by R(M, G, O).\nThe following proposition is standard.\nProposition 9.2. If M is a symplectic variety and the action of G on μ-1(O) is free, then\nR(M, G, O) is a symplectic variety, of dimension dim(M) - 2 dim(G) + dim(O).\n9.2. The Calogero-Moser space. Let M = T ∗Matn(C), and G = PGLn(C) (so g =\nsln(C)). Using the trace form we can identify g∗ with g, and M with Matn(C) ⊕ Matn(C).\nThen a moment map is given by the formula μ(X, Y ) = [X, Y ], for X, Y ∈ Matn(C).\nLet O be the orbit of the matrix diag(-1, -1, . . . , -1, n - 1), i.e. the set of traceless\nmatrices T such that T + 1 has rank 1.\nDefinition 9.3 (Kazhdan, Kostant, Sternberg, [KKS]). The scheme Cn := R(M, G, O) is\ncalled the Calogero-Moser space.\nProposition 9.4. The action of G on μ-1(O) is free, and thus (by Proposition 9.2) Cn is a\nsmooth symplectic variety (of dimension 2n).\nProof. It suffices to show that if X, Y are such that XY - Y X + 1 has rank 1, then (X, Y )\nis an irreducible set of matrices. Indeed, in this case, by Schur's lemma, if B ∈ GLn is such\nthat BX = XB and BY = Y B then B is a scalar, so the stabilizer of (X, Y ) in PGLn is\ntrivial.\nTo show this, assume that W =6\n0 is an invariant subspace of X, Y . In this case, the\neigenvalues of [X, Y ] on W are a subcollection of the collection of n - 1 copies of -1 and\none copy of n - 1. The sum of the elements of this subcollection must be zero, since it is the\ntrace of [X, Y ] on W. But then the subcollection must be the entire collection, so W = Cn ,\nas desired.\n\nThus, Cn is the space of conjugacy classes of pairs of n × n matrices (X, Y ) such that the\nmatrix XY - Y X + 1 has rank 1.\nIn fact, one also has the following more complicated theorem.\nTheorem 9.5 (G. Wilson, [Wi]). The Calogero-Moser space is connected.\nWe will give a proof of this theorem later, in Subsection 9.4.\n\n9.3. The Calogero-Moser integrable system. Let M be a symplectic variety, and let\nH1, . . . , Hn be regular functions on M such that {Hi, Hj } = 0 and Hi's are algebraically\nindependent everywhere. Assume that M carries a symplectic action of a reductive algebraic\ngroup G with moment map μ : M → g∗, which preserves the functions Hi, and let O be\na coadjoint orbit of G. Assume that G acts freely on μ-1(O), and so the Calogero-Moser\nspace R(M, G, O) is symplectic. The functions Hi descend to R(M, G, O). If they are still\nalgebraically independent and n = dim R(M, G, O)/2, then we get an integrable system on\nR(M, G, O).\nA vivid example of this is the Kazhdan-Kostant-Sternberg construction of the Calogero-\nMoser system. In this case M = T ∗Matn(C) (regarded as the set of pairs of matrices (X, Y )\nas in Section 9.2), with the usual symplectic form ω = Tr (dY ∧ dX). Let Hi = Tr (Y i),\ni = 1, . . . , n. Let G = PGLn(C) act on M by conjugation, and let O be the coadjoint\norbit of G considered in Subsection 9.2. Then the system H1, . . . , Hn descends to a system\nof functions in involution on R(M, G, O), which is the Calogero-Moser space Cn. Since\nthis space is 2n-dimensional, H1, . . . , Hn form an integrable system on Cn. It is called the\n(rational) Calogero-Moser system.\nThe Calogero-Moser flow is, by definition, the Hamiltonian flow on Cn defined by the\nHamiltonian H = H2 = Tr (Y 2). Thus this flow is integrable, in the sense that it can be\nincluded in an integrable system. In particular, its solutions can be found in quadratures\nusing the inductive procedure of reduction of order. However (as often happens with systems\nobtained by reduction), solutions can also be found by a much simpler procedure, since\nthey can be found already on the \"non-reduced\" space M: indeed, on M the Calogero-\nMoser flow is just the motion of a free particle in the space of matrices, so it has the form\ngt(X, Y ) = (X + 2Y t, Y ). The same formula is valid on Cn. In fact, we can use the same\nmethod to compute the flows corresponding to all the Hamiltonians Hi = Tr (Y i), i ∈ N:\nthese flows are given by the formulas\ngt\n(i)(X, Y ) = (X + iY i-1t, Y ).\nLet us write the Calogero-Moser system explicitly in coordinates. To do so, we first need\nto introduce local coordinates on the Calogero-Moser space Cn.\nTo this end, let us restrict our attention to the open set Un\nwhich consists of\n⊂Cn\nconjugacy classes of those pairs (X, Y ) for which the matrix X is diagonalizable, with distinct\neigenvalues; by Wilson's Theorem 9.5, this open set is dense in Cn.\nA point P ∈ Un may be represented by a pair (X, Y ) such that X = diag(x1, . . . , xn),\nxi = xj . In this case, the entries of T := XY - Y X are (xi - xj )yij . In particular, the\ndiagonal entries are zero. Since the matrix T + 1 has rank 1, its entries κij have the form\naibj for some numbers ai, bj . On the other hand, κii = 1, so bj = a-\nj\n1 and hence κij = aia-\nj\n1 .\nBy conjugating (X, Y ) by the matrix diag(a1, . . . , an), we can reduce to the situation when\nai = 1, so κij = 1. Hence the matrix T has entries 1 - δij (zeros on the diagonal, ones off\nthe diagonal). Moreover, the representative of P with diagonal X and T as above is unique\nup to the action of the symmetric group Sn. Finally, we have (xi - xj )yij = 1 for i =6\nj, so\nthe entries of the matrix Y are yij = 1/(xi - xj) if i =6\nj. On the other hand, the diagonal\nentries yii of Y are unconstrained. Thus we have obtained the following result.\nProposition 9.6. Let Cn be the open set of (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Cn such that xi =6\nxj for i =6\nj.\nreg\nThen there exists an isomorphism of algebraic varieties ξ : T ∗(Cn /Sn)\nUn given by the\nreg\n→\n\nX\nX\nP\nP\nformula\n(x1, . . . , xn, p1, . . . , pn) 7→ (X, Y ),\nwhere X = diag(x1, . . . , xn), and Y = Y (x, p) := (yij ),\nyij =\n, i = j, yii = pi.\nxi - xj\nIn fact, we have a stronger result:\nProposition 9.7. ξ is an isomorphism of symplectic varieties (where the cotangent bundle\nis equipped with the usual symplectic structure).\nFor the proof of Proposition 9.7, we will need the following general and important but\neasy theorem.\nTheorem 9.8 (The necklace bracket formula). Let a1, . . . , ar and b1, . . . , bs be either X or\nY . Then on M we have\n{Tr (a1 · · · ar), Tr (b1 · · · bs)} =\nTr (ai+1 · · · ara1 · · · ai-1bj+1 · · · bsb1 · · · bj-1) -\n(i,j):ai=Y,bj =X\nTr (ai+1 · · · ara1 · · · ai-1bj+1 · · · bsb1 · · · bj-1).\n(i,j):ai=X,bj =Y\nProof of Proposition 9.7. Let ak = Tr (Xk), bk = Tr (XkY ). It is easy to check using the\nnecklace bracket formula that on M we have\n{am, ak} = 0,\n{bm, ak} = kam+k-1,\n{bm, bk} = (k - m)bm+k-1.\nOn the other hand, ξ∗ak =\nxi\nk , ξ∗bk =\nxi\nkpi. Thus we see that\n{f, g} = {ξ∗f, ξ∗g},\nwhere f, g are either ak or bk. But the functions ak, bk, k = 0, . . . , n - 1, form a local\ncoordinate system near a generic point of Un, so we are done.\n\nNow let us write the Hamiltonian of the Calogero-Moser system in coordinates. It has the\nform\nX\nX\n(9.1)\nH = Tr (Y (x, p)2) =\npi\n2 -\n(xi - xj )2 .\ni\ni=j\nThus the Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian describes the motion of a system of n particles on the\nline with interaction potential -1/x2, which we considered in Section 2.\nNow we finally see the usefulness of the Hamiltonian reduction procedure. The point is\nthat it is not clear at all from formula (9.1) why the Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian should be\ncompletely integrable. However, our reduction procedure implies the complete integrability\nof H, and gives an explicit formula for the first integrals: 7\nHi = Tr (Y (x, p)i).\nMoreover, this procedure immediately gives us an explicit solution of the system. Namely,\nassume that x(t), p(t) is the solution with initial condition x(0), p(0). Let (X0, Y0) =\n7Thus, for type A we have two methods of proving the integrability of the Calogero-Moser system - one\nusing Dunkl operators and one using Hamiltonian reduction.\n\nQ\ne\ne\ne\nξ(x(0), p(0)). Then xi(t) are the eigenvalues of the matrix Xt := X0 + 2tY0, and pi(t) =\nx0\ni(t)/2.\n9.4. Proof of Wilson's theorem. Let us now give a proof of Theorem 9.5.\nWe have already shown that all components of Cn are smooth and have dimension 2n.\nAlso, we know that there is at least one component (the closure of Un), and that the other\ncomponents, if they exist, do not contain pairs (X, Y ) in which X is regular semisimple.\ncontained in the hypersurface Δ(X)\nΔ(X) stands for the discriminant of X (i.e., Δ(X) :=\n(xi - xj ), where xi are the\ni=j\neigenvalues of X).\nThus, to show that such additional components don't in fact exist, it suffices to show that\nthe dimension of the subscheme Cn(0) cut out in Cn by the equation Δ(X) = 0 is 2n - 1.\nTo do so, first notice that the condition rank ([X, Y ] + 1) = 1 is equivalent to the equa\ntion ∧2([X, Y ] + 1) = 0; thus, the latter can be used as the equation defining Cn inside\nT ∗Matn/P GLn.\n(we use the filtration on O(Cn\nC\nThis means that these components\n0, where\nare\n=\nDefine C := Spec(grO(Cn)) to be the degeneration of Cn\n)\nn\ndefined by deg(X) = 0, deg(Y ) = 1). Then C0 is a closed subscheme in the scheme\nn\nout by the equations ∧2([X, Y ]) = 0 in T ∗Matn\nn\neC\nC\nC\ncut\nn\n/PGLn.\nLet ( )red be the reduced part of\nThen ( )red coincides with the categorical quotient\n.\nn\nn\n{(X, Y )|rank ([X, Y ]) ≤ 1}/PGLn.\nOur proof is based on the following proposition.\nProposition 9.9. The categorical quotient {(X, Y )|rank ([X, Y ]) ≤ 1}/PGLn coincides with\nthe categorical quotient {(X, Y )|[X, Y ] = 0}/PGLn.\nProof. It is clear that {(X, Y )|[X, Y ] = 0}/PGLn is contained in {(X, Y )|rank ([X, Y ]) ≤\n1}/PGLn. For the proof of the opposite inclusion we need to show that any regular function\non {(X, Y )|rank ([X, Y ]) ≤ 1}/PGLn is completely determined by its values on the subvariety\n{(X, Y )|[X, Y ] = 0}/PGLn, i.e. that any invariant polynomial on the set of pairs of matrices\nwith commutator of rank at most 1 is completely determined by its values on pairs of\ncommuting matrices. To this end, we need the following lemma from linear algebra.\nLemma 9.10. If A, B are square matrices such that [A, B] has rank ≤ 1, then there exists\na basis in which both A, B are upper triangular.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we can assume ker A =6\n0 (by replacing A with A - λ if\nneeded) and that A = 0. It suffices to show that there exists a proper nonzero subspace\ninvariant under A, B; then the statement will follow by induction in dimension.\nLet C = [A, B] and suppose rank C = 1 (since the case rank C = 0 is trivial). If ker A ⊂\nker C, then ker A is B-invariant: if Av = 0 then ABv = BAv + Cv = 0. Thus ker A is the\nrequired subspace. If ker A * ker C, then there exists a vector v such that Av = 0 but Cv = 0.\nSo ABv = Cv =6\n0. Thus ImC ⊂ ImA. So ImA is B-invariant: BAv = ABv + Cv ∈ ImA.\nSo ImA is the required subspace.\nThis proves the lemma.\n\nNow we are ready to prove Proposition 9.9. By the fundamental theorem of invariant\ntheory, the ring of invariants of X and Y is generated by traces of words of X and Y :\nTr(w(X, Y )). If X and Y are upper triangular with eigenvalues xi, yi, then any such trace\n\nP\nP\nP\nQ\nm\nr\nhas the form\nxi yi , i.e. coincides with the value of the corresponding invariant on the\ndiagonal parts Xdiag, Ydiag of X and Y , which commute. The proposition is proved.\n\nWe will also need the following proposition:\nProposition 9.11. The categorical quotient {(X, Y ) [X, Y ] = 0}/PGLn is isomorphic to\n(Cn × Cn)/Sn, i.e. its function algebra is C[x1, . . . , xn\n|\n, y1, . . . , yn]Sn .\nProof. Restriction to diagonal matrices defines a homomorphism\nξ : O({(X, Y )|[X, Y ] = 0}/PGLn) → C[x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn]Sn .\nSince (as explained in the proof of Proposition 9.9), any invariant polynomial of entries of\ncommuting matrices is determined by its values on diagonal matrices, this map is injective.\nm\nr\nAlso, ξ(Tr (XmY r)) =\nxi yi , where xi, yi are the eigenvalues of X and Y .\nNow we use the following well known theorem of H. Weyl (from his book \"Classical\ngroups\").\nTheorem 9.12. Let B be an algebra over C. Then the algebra SnB is generated by elements\nof the form\nb ⊗ 1 ⊗· · · ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ b ⊗· · · ⊗ 1 + · · · + 1 ⊗ 1 ⊗· · · ⊗ b.\nProof. Since SnB is linearly spanned by elements of the form x ⊗· · · ⊗ x, x ∈ B, it suffices\nto prove the theorem in the special case B = C[x]. In this case, the result is simply the fact\nthat the ring of symmetric functions is generated by power sums, which is well known.\n\n]Sn\nm\nr\nCorollary 9.13. The ring C[x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn\nis generated by the polynomials\nxi yi\nfor m, r ≥ 0, m + r > 0.\nProof. Apply Theorem 9.12 in the case B = C[x, y].\n\nCorollary 9.13 implies that ξ is surjective. Proposition 9.11 is proved.\n\nNow we are ready to prove Wilson's theorem. Let Cn(0)0 be the degeneration of Cn(0), i.e.\nthe subscheme of C0 cut out by the equation Δ(X) = 0. According to Propositions 9.9 and\nn\n9.11, the reduced part (Cn(0)0)red is contained in the hypersurface in (Cn × Cn)/Sn cut out\nby the equation\n(xi - xj ) = 0. This hypersurface has dimension 2n - 1, so we are done.\ni<j\n9.5. The Gan-Ginzburg theorem. Let Comm(n) be the commuting scheme defined in\nT ∗Matn = Matn × Matn by the equations [X, Y ] = 0, X, Y ∈ Matn. Let G = PGLn, and\nconsider the categorical quotient Comm(n)/G (i.e., the Hamiltonian reduction μ-1(0)/G of\nT ∗Matn by the action of G), whose algebra of regular functions is A = C[Comm(n)]G .\nIt is not known whether the commuting scheme Comm(n) is reduced (i.e. whether the\ncorresponding ideal is a radical ideal); this is a well known open problem. The underlying\nvariety is irreducible (as was shown by Gerstenhaber [Ge1]), but very singular, and has a\nvery complicated structure. However, we have the following result.\nTheorem 9.14 (Gan, Ginzburg, [GG]). Comm(n)/G is reduced, and isomorphic to C2n/Sn.\nThus A = C[x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn]Sn . The Poisson bracket on this algebra is induced from\nthe standard symplectic structure on C2n .\n\nX\nSketch of the proof. Look at the almost commuting variety Mn ⊂ gl × gl × Cn × (Cn)∗\nn\nn\ndefined by\nMn = {(X, Y, v, f)|[X, Y ] + v ⊗ f = 0}.\nGan and Ginzburg proved the following result.\nTheorem 9.15. Mn is a complete intersection. It has n +1 irreducible components denoted\nby Mi , labeled by i = dim ChX, Y iv. Also, Mn is generically reduced.\nn\nSince Mn is generically reduced and is a complete intersection, by a standard result of\ncommutative algebra it is reduced. Thus C[Mn] has no nonzero nilpotents. This implies\nC[Mn]G has no nonzero nilpotents.\nHowever, it is easy to show that the algebra C[Mn]G is isomorphic to the algebra of\ninvariant polynomials of entries of X and Y modulo the \"rank 1\" relation ∧2[X, Y ] = 0. By\na scheme-theoretic version of Proposition 9.9 (proved in [EG]), the latter is isomorphic to\nA. This implies the theorem (the statement about Poisson structures is checked directly in\ncoordinates on the open part where X is regular semisimple).\n\n9.6. The space Mc for Sn and the Calogero-Moser space. Let H0,c = H0,c[Sn, V ] be\nthe symplectic reflection algebra of the symmetric group Sn and space V = h ⊕ h∗, where\nh = Cn (i.e., the rational Cherednik algebra H0,c(Sn, h)). Let Mc = Spec B0,c[Sn, V ] be the\nCalogero-Moser space defined in Section 8.5. It is a symplectic variety for c = 0.\nTheorem 9.16. For c = 0\nthe space Mc is isomorphic to the Calogero-Moser space Cn as a\nsymplectic variety.\nProof. To prove the theorem, we will first construct a map f : Mc\n, and then prove that\n→Cn\nf is an isomorphism.\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that c = 1. As we have shown before, the\nalgebra H0,c is an Azumaya algebra. Therefore, Mc can be regarded as the moduli space of\nirreducible representations of H0,c.\nLet E ∈ Mc be an irreducible representation of H0,c. We have seen before that E has\ndimension n! and is isomorphic to the regular representation as a representation of Sn. Let\nSn-1 ⊂ Sn be the subgroup which preserves the element 1. Then the space of invariants\nESn-1 has dimension n. On this space we have operators X, Y : ESn-1\nESn-1 obtained\n→\nby restriction of the operators x1, y1 on E to the subspace of invariants. We have\nn\n[X, Y ] = T :=\ns1i.\ni=2\nLet us now calculate the right hand side of this equation explicitly. Let e be the symmetrizer\nof Sn-1. Let us realize the regular representation E of Sn as C[Sn] with action of Sn by\nleft multiplication. Then v1 = e, v2 = es12, . . . , vn = es1n is a basis of ESn-1 . The element\nT commutes with e, so we have\nX\nTvi =\nvj .\nj=i\nThis means that T +1 has rank 1, and hence the pair (X, Y ) defines a point on the Calogero-\nMoser space Cn. 8\n8Note that the pair (X, Y ) is well defined only up to conjugation, because the representation E is well\ndefined only up to an isomorphism.\n\nX X\nP\nP\nWe now set (X, Y ) = f(E). It is clear that f : Mc\nis a regular map. So it remains to\n→Cn\nshow that f is an isomorphism. This is equivalent to showing that the corresponding map\nof function algebras f ∗ : O(Cn) → B0,c is an isomorphism.\nLet us calculate f and f ∗ more explicitly. To do so, consider the open set U in Mc consisting\nof representations in which xi -xj acts invertibly. These are exactly the representations that\nare obtained by restricting representations of Sn n C[x1, . . . , xn, p1, . . . , pn, δ(x)-1] using the\nclassical Dunkl embedding. Thus representations E ∈ U are of the form E = Eλ,μ (λ, μ ∈ Cn ,\nand λ has distinct coordinates), where Eλ,μ is the space of complex valued functions on the\norbit Oλ,μ ⊂ C2n, with the following action of H0,c:\nX (sijF )(a, b)\n(xiF )(a, b) = aiF (a, b),\n(yiF )(a, b) = biF (a, b) +\n.\nai - aj\nj=i\n(the group Sn acts by permutations).\nNow let us consider the space ESn-1 . A basis of this space is formed by characteristic\nλ,μ\nfunctions of Sn-1-orbits on Oλ,μ. Using the above presentation, it is straightforward to\ncalculate the matrices of the operators X and Y in this basis:\nX = diag(λ1, . . . , λn),\nand\nYij = μi if j = i, Yij =\nif j = i.\nλi - λj\nThis shows that f induces an isomorphism f|U : U → Un, where Un is the subset of Cn\nconsisting of pairs (X, Y ) for which X has distinct eigenvalues.\nFrom this presentation, it is straigtforward that f ∗(Tr (Xp)) = xp\n1 +\n+ xp\nn for every\n· · ·\npositive integer p. Also, f commutes with the natural SL2(C)-action on Mc and Cn (by\n(X, Y )\n(aX + bY, cX + dY )), so we also get f ∗(Tr (Y p)) = y1\np +\n+ yn\np , and\n→\n· · ·\np\nm\np-m\nf ∗(Tr (XpY )) =\nxi yixi\n.\np + 1 m=0\ni\nNow, using the necklace bracket formula on Cn and the commutation relations of H0,c, we\nfind, by a direct computation, that f ∗ preserves Poisson bracket on the elements Tr (Xp),\nTr (XqY ). But these elements are a local coordinate system near a generic point, so it follows\nthat f is a Poisson map. Since the algebra B0,c is Poisson generated by\nxi\np and\nyi\np for\nall p, we get that f ∗ is a surjective map.\nAlso, f ∗ is injective. Indeed, by Wilson's theorem the Calogero-Moser space is connected,\nand hence the algebra O(Cn) has no zero divisors, while Cn has the same dimension as Mc.\nThis proves that f ∗ is an isomorphism, so f is an isomorphism.\n\n9.7. The Hilbert scheme Hilbn(C2) and the Calogero-Moser space. The Hilbert\nscheme Hilbn(C2) is defined to be\nHilbn(C2) = { ideals I ⊂ C[x, y]|codimI = n}\n= {(E, v)|E is a C[x, y]-module of dimension n, v is a cyclic vector of E}.\nThe second equality can be easily seen from the short exact sequence\nI\nC[x, y]\nE\n0.\n→\n→\n→\n→\n\nLet S(n)C2 = C2 × · · · × C2\n, where Sn acts by permutation. We have a natural map\n|\n{z\n} /Sn\nn times\nHilbn(C2)\nS(n)C2 which sends every ideal I to its zero set (with multiplicities). This map\n→\nis called the Hilbert-Chow map.\nTheorem 9.17 (Fogarty, [F]).\n(i) Hilbn(C2) is a smooth quasiprojective variety.\n(ii) The Hilbert-Chow map Hilbn(C2)\nS(n)C2 is projective. It is a resolution of singu\n→\nlarities.\nProof. Proof can be found in [Na].\n\nNow consider the Calogero-Moser space Cn defined in Section 9.2.\nTheorem 9.18 (see [Na]). The Hilbert Scheme Hilbn(C2) is Cinf-diffeomorphic to Cn.\nRemark 9.19. More precisely there exists a family of algebraic varieties over A1, say Xt,\nt ∈ A1, such that Xt is isomorphic to Cn if t = 0 and\nX0 is the Hilbert scheme; and also if we\ndenote by Xt the deformation of C2n/Sn into the Calogero-Moser space, then there exists\na map ft : Xt Xt, such that for t =6\n0, ft is an isomorphism and f0 is the Hilbert-Chow\nmap.\nRemark 9.20. Consider the action of G = PGLn on T ∗Matn. As we have discussed, the\ncorresponding moment map is μ(X, Y ) = [X, Y ], so μ-1(0) = {(X, Y )|[X, Y ] = 0} is the\ncommuting variety. We can consider two kinds of quotient μ-1(0)/G (i.e., of Hamiltonian\nreduction):\n(1) The categorical quotient, i.e.,\n= (Cn\nSpec(C[xij , yij]/h[X, Y ] = 0i)G ∼\n× Cn)/Sn.\nIt is a reduced (by Gan-Ginzburg Theorem 9.14), affine but singular variety.\n(2) The GIT quotient, in which the stability condition is that there exists a cyclic vector\nfor X, Y . This quotient is Hilbn(C2), which is smooth but not affine.\nBoth of these reductions are degenerations of the reduction along the orbit of matrices T\nsuch that T + 1 has rank 1, which yields the space Cn. This explains why Theorem 9.18 and\nthe results mentioned in Remark 9.19 are natural to expect.\n9.8. The cohomology of Cn. We also have the following result describing the cohomology\nof Cn (and hence, by Theorem 9.18, of Hilbn(C2)). Define the age filtration for the symmetric\ngroup Sn by setting\nage(transposition) = 1.\nThen one can show that for any σ ∈ Sn, age(σ) = rank (1 - σ)|reflection representation. It is easy\nto see that 0 ≤ age ≤ n-1. Notice also that the age filtration can be defined for any Coxeter\ngroup.\nTheorem 9.21 (Lehn-Sorger, Vasserot). The cohomology ring H∗(Cn, C) lives in even degrees\nonly and is isomorphic to gr(Center(C[Sn])) under the age filtration (with doubled degrees).\nProof. Let us sketch a noncommutative-algebraic proof of this theorem, given in [EG]. This\nproof is based on the following result.\n\nTheorem 9.22 (Nest-Tsygan, [NT]). If M is an affine symplectic variety and A is a quan\ntization of M, then\nHH∗(A[~-1], A[~-1]) ∼= H∗(M, C((~)))\nas an algebra over C((~)).\nNow, we know that the algebra Bt,c is a quantization of Cn. Therefore by above theorem,\nthe cohomology algebra of Cn is the cohomology of Bt,c (for generic t). But Bt,c is Morita\nequivalent to Ht,c, so this cohomology is the same as the Hochschild cohomology of Ht,c.\nHowever, the latter can be computed by using that Ht,c is given by generators and relations\n(by producing explicit representatives of cohomology classes and computing their product),\nwhich gives the result.\n\n9.9.
