  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nPrerequisite\n\nMIT students are required to get the permission of the instructor. No prior training or experience in physical planning or urban design is assumed, although it is advantageous. Some exposure to imaging software and Geographic Information System (GIS) is helpful.\n\nThe \"Envisioning Needham Street\" Plan\n\nThe City of Newton's Department of Planning and Development has engaged the Community Growth and Land-Use Planning course of MIT (11.360) to envision redevelopment along the Needham Street Corridor and recommend implementation strategies to make the plan a reality. As a gateway to the city of Newton, Needham Street has the potential to be an inviting place that encourages people to work, shop, enjoy civic interaction, and live. The city is interested in reconstructing the street in the near future, and the project with MIT is designed to assist in improving its appearance and transportation options, and inspire economic development.\n\nCourse Overview\n\nThis subject explores the techniques, processes, and personal and professional skills required to effectively manage growth and land use change. While primarily focused on the planning practice in the United States, the principles and techniques reviewed and presented may have international application. This course is not for bystanders; it is designed for those who wish to become actively involved or exposed to the planning discipline and profession as it is practiced today, and as it may need to be practiced in the future.\n\nThe fundamentals of the land use planning and growth management system are explored. Discussion and review of both traditional and innovative approaches to land use planning and growth management will occur, with emphasis on participatory processes and performance-based systems. Examples of the tools and techniques utilized at the local, regional, and state level of government will also be presented and evaluated.\n\nA major focus of the course involves student work on a client-based land use planning project in Newton, Massachusetts. The project will enable students to draw upon and apply a variety of approaches and interventions explored in the course and readings.\n\nFormat\n\nClass sessions employ lectures, discussions of readings, case materials, role-playing exercises, and student presentations. Readings include journal articles, papers, and other written works relevant to contemporary planning practice and the evolution of the discipline. These readings supplement class session topics and discussion. Where appropriate to specific topics, guest speakers will present to the class and join in class discussion. There is no final examination required for completion of the course. In addition to classwork, each student will be required to participate, as a project team member, in the preparation of a project for an actual client.\n\nEvaluation\n\nStudent evaluations will be principally based upon contributions to the community planning project, including the preparation of the final plan report, participation in mid-term and final presentations of the plan to the client and others, and submission of a short \"synthesis paper\" about the planning project. Participation in class discussion will also be a significant factor in final grade evaluations.",

      "content": "Terry's Tips for Readying A Plan for Adoption and Success\nTerry S. Szold, Principal\nCommunity Planning Solutions\n\nThere are a variety of ways that planners elect to organize plans or planning reports.\nBased upon almost 25 years of experience in the profession, I believe the most successful\nplans contain and are organized as follows:\n\n- An \"Executive Summary\" of the main goals, ideas, and recommendations of the plan\n(usually no more than five pages).\n\n- A brief \"Introductory\" chapter or section describing the plan's organization and\ncontent.\n\n- An \"Analysis and Findings\" section that distills important facts and data about\nexisting conditions of an area or context that is being evaluated, to help convey a\nsense of place to the reader. Sometimes this section or chapter includes an analysis of\n\"assets, liabilities, and opportunities\" (ALO) of the area being evaluated. Sometimes\nthe ALO is highlighted as a separate section or chapter.\n\n- Recommended \"Alternatives and Strategies,\" which are clearly advanced, sometimes\nbroken into short-term versus long-range plan categories.\n\n- A \"Preferred Plan\" scenario, which can be highlighted within the section described\nabove or set forth separately.\n\n- \"Implementation Strategies\" to help bring the plan to fruition. Often such a section\nwill include guidance about the necessary institutional resources that may be required,\nas well as references to where and how a community can leverage resources beyond\nits own revenue base -including private, state, or federal resources.\n\nPlans that communicate their ideas coherently and persuasively have an improved\nlikelihood of being seriously considered and followed. Coherent and persuasive\ncommunication involves strategic use of narrative and graphic material. Careful editing\nand proofreading is essential. Punctuating text with visual images help to animate and\nconvey ideas. For plans that have a more organizational, process, or less place-centered\nfocus, use of flow charts, tables, and text boxes can help engage and navigate the reader,\nand enhance the fluency of public officials with the main ideas and recommendations\nbeing advanced.\n\nAlways consider how well the text and images of a plan will reproduce or print. Rarely\ndo planning officials and citizens have access to \"camera-ready\" originals. Poor or faded\ngraphics or images can doom serious consideration of a plan.\n\nRemember: planning is a verb! A plan or planning report needs to engage its intended\naudience. The quality of the document that is created involves both form and content.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\n11.360 Community Growth and Land Use Planning\nFall 2010\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
