For what we are going to be interested in, we may assume\nthat n = 1.\nBy way of illustration, the set of strict limit points of\nA = { n | n ∈ N } ∪{0},\nis {0}. Note that this is also the set of strict limit points of\nA -{0} = { n | n ∈ N }.\nStarting with any subset A ⊂ R, we are interested in how many times\nwe need to iterate the procedure of passing to the set of strict limit\npoints, until we get to the emptyset.\nFor example, starting with\nA0 = { n | n ∈ N } ∪{0},\nif we replace A0 by its set of strict limit points, then we get\nA1 = {0}.\nThe set of limit points of A1 is the emptyset,\nA2 = ∅,\nso that it takes two steps. Find examples of sets A ⊂ R such that\nit takes n steps to get to the empty set. Find an example of a set\nA which takes infinitely many steps. Now find another set A0 which\ntakes more steps than A to get to the empty set. (It is probably not\nso instructive to write down these examples, it is more interesting to\nconvince yourself that they exist; for this it is helpful to sketch points\nthe number line).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.022 Calculus of Several Variables\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "1. Vectors in R2 and R3\nDefinition 1.1. A vector ~v ∈ R3 is a 3-tuple of real numbers (v1, v2, v3).\nHopefully the reader can well imagine the definition of a vector in\nR2 .\nExample 1.2. (1, 1, 0) and (\n√\n2, π, 1/e) are vectors in R3 .\nDefinition 1.3. The zero vector in R3 , denoted ~0, is the vector\n(0, 0, 0). If ~v = (v1, v2, v3) and w~ = (w1, w2, w3) are two vectors in\nR3, the sum of ~v and w~, denoted ~v + w~, is the vector (v1 + w1, v2 +\nw2, v3 + w3).\nIf ~v = (v1, v2, v3) ∈ R3 is a vector and λ ∈ R is a scalar, the scalar\nproduct of λ and v, denoted λ ~v, is the vector (λv1, λv2, λv3).\n·\nExample 1.4. If ~v = (2, -3, 1) and w~ = (1, -5, 3) then ~v + w~ =\n(3, -8, 4). If λ = -3 then λ ~v = (-6, 9, -3).\n·\nLemma 1.5. If λ and μ are scalars and ~u, ~v and w~ are vectors in R3 ,\nthen\n(1) ~0 + ~v = ~0.\n(2) ~u + (~v + w~) = (~u + ~v) + w~.\n(3) ~u + ~v = ~v + ~u.\n(4) λ (μ ~v) = (λμ) ~v.\n·\n·\n·\n(5) (λ + μ) ~v = λ ~v + μ ~v.\n·\n·\n·\n(6) λ (~u + ~v) = λ ~u + λ ~v.\n·\n·\n·\nProof. We check (3). If ~u = (u1, u2, u3) and ~v = (v1, v2, v3), then\n~u + ~v = (u1 + v1, u2 + v2, u3 + v3)\n= (v1 + u1, v2 + u2, v3 + u3)\n= ~v + ~u.\n\nWe can interpret vector addition and scalar multiplication geometri\ncally. We can think of a vector as representing a displacement from\nthe origin. Geometrically a vector ~v has a magnitude (or length)\n|~v| = (v1\n2 + v2\n2 + v2)1/2 and every non-zero vector has a direction\n~v\n~u =\n.\n|~v|\nMultiplying by a scalar leaves the direction unchanged and rescales the\nmagnitude. To add two vectors ~v and w~, think of transporting the tail\nof w~ to the endpoint of ~v. The sum of ~v and w~ is the vector whose tail\nis the tail of the transported vector.\n\nOne way to think of this is in terms of directed line segments. Note\nthat given a point P and a vector ~v we can add ~v to P to get another\npoint Q. If P = (p1, p2, p3) and ~v = (v1, v2, v3) then\nQ = P + ~v = (p1 + v1, p2 + v2, p3 + v3).\nIf Q =\nPQ, such that Q\n(q1, q2, q3), then there is a unique vector -→\n=\nP + ~v, namely\n-→\nPQ = (q1 - p1, q2 - p2, q3 - p3).\nLemma 1.6. Let P , Q and R be three points in R3 .\nThen -→\nQR = -→\nPQ + -→\nPR.\nProof. Let us consider the result of adding -→\nQR to P ,\nPQ + -→\nP + (-→\nQR) = (P + -→\nQR\nPQ + -→\nPQ) + -→\n= Q + -→\nQR\n= R.\nOn the other hand, there is at most one vector ~v such that when we\nadd it P we get R, namely the vector -→So -→\nQR = -→\n\nPR.\nPQ + -→\nPR.\nNote that (1.6) expresses the geometrically obvious statement that\nif one goes from P to Q and then from Q to R, this is the same as\ngoing from P to R.\nVectors arise quite naturally in nature. We can use vectors to rep\nresent forces; every force has both a magnitude and a direction. The\ncombined effect of two forces is represented by the vector sum. Sim\nilarly we can use vectors to measure both velocity and acceleration.\nThe equation\nF~ = m~a,\nis the vector form of Newton's famous equation.\nNote that R3 comes with three standard unit vectors\nˆı = (1, 0, 0)\njˆ= (0, 1, 0)\nand\nkˆ = (0, 0, 1),\nwhich are called the standard basis. Any vector can be written uniquely\nas a linear combination of these vectors,\nˆ\n~v = (v1, v2, v3) = v1ˆı + v2jˆ+ v3k.\nWe can use vectors to parametrise lines in R3 . Suppose we are given\ntwo different points P and Q of R3 . Then there is a unique line l\ncontaining P and Q. Suppose that R = (x, y, z) is a general point of\n\nthe line. Note that the vector -→\nPQ, so that\nPR is parallel to the vector -→\n-→\nPQ.\nPR is a scalar multiple of -→Algebraically,\n-→\nPQ,\nPR = t-→\nfor some scalar t ∈ R. If P = (p1, p2, p3) and Q = (q1, q2, q3), then\n(x - p1, y - p2, z - p3) = t(q1 - p1, q2 - p2, q3 - p3) = t(v1, v2, v3),\nwhere (v1, v2, v3) = (q1 - p1, q2 - p2, q3 - p3). We can always rewrite\nthis as,\n(x, y, z) = (p1, p2, p3) + t(v1, v2, v3) = (p1 + tv1, p2 + tv2, p3 + tv3).\nWriting these equations out in coordinates, we get\nx = p1 + tv1\ny = p2 + tv2\nand\nz = p3 + tv3.\nExample 1.7. If P = (1, -2, 3) and Q = (1, 0, -1), then ~v = (0, 2, -4)\nand a general point of the line containing P and Q is given parametri\ncally by\n(x, y, z) = (1, -2, 3) + t(0, 2, -4) = (1, -2 + 2t, 3 - 4t).\nExample 1.8. Where do the two lines l1 and l2\n(x, y, z) = (1, -2+2t, 3 - 4t)\nand\n(x, y, z) = (2t - 1, -3+ t, 3t),\nintersect?\nWe are looking for a point (x, y, z) common to both lines. So we have\n(1, -2 + 2s, 3 - 4s) = (2t - 1, -3 + t, 3t).\nLooking at the first component, we must have t = 1. Looking at the\nsecond component, we must have -2 + 2s = -2, so that s = 0. By\ninspection, the third component comes out equal to 3 in both cases. So\nthe lines intersect at the point (1, -2, 3).\nExample 1.9. Where does the line\n(x, y, z) = (1 - t, 2 - 3t, 2t + 1)\nintersect the plane\n2x - 3y + z = 6?\nWe must have\n2(1 - t) - 3(2 - 3t) + (2t + 1) = 6.\nSolving for t we get\n9t - 3 = 6,\nso that t = 1. The line intersects the plane at the point\n(x, y, z) = (0, -1, 3).\n\nExample 1.10. A cycloid is the path traced in the plane, by a point\non the circumference of a circle as the circle rolls along the ground.\nLet's find the parametric form of a cycloid. Let's suppose that the\ncircle has radius a, the circle rolls along the x-axis and the point is at\nthe origin at time t = 0. We suppose that the cylinder rotates through\nan angle of t radians in time t. So the circumference travels a distance\nof at. It follows that the centre of the circle at time t is at the point\nP = (at, a). Call the point on the circumference Q = (x, y) and let O\nbe the centre of coordinates. We have\n(x, y) = -→\nOP + -→\nOQ = -→\nPQ.\nNow relative to P , the point Q just goes around a circle of radius a.\nNote that the circle rotates backwards and at time t = 0, the angle\n3π/2. So we have\n-→\nPQ = (a cos(3π/2 - t), a sin(3π/2 - t)) = (-a sin t, -a cos t)\nPutting all of this together, we have\n(x, y) = (at - a sin t, a - a cos t).\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.022 Calculus of Several Variables\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

One can prove\nthe general case of (11.1), by hand (basically lots of 's and δ's). How\never, perhaps the best way to prove (11.1) is to use the chain rule,\nproved in the next section.\nWhat about higher derivatives?\nDefinition 11.2.

Let A ⊂ Rn be an open subset and let f : A -→ Rm\nbe a function. We say that f is of class Ck if all kth partial derivatives\nexist and are continuous.\nWe say that f is of class Cinf (aka smooth) if f is of class Ck for\nall k.\nIn lecture 10 we saw that if f is C1, then it is differentiable.\nTheorem 11.5.

The objective is to find a solution to the equation\nf(x) = 0.\nNewton's method proceeds as follows. Start with some x0 ∈ A. The\nbest linear approximation to f(x) in a neighbourhood of x0 is given by\nf(x0) + f 0(x0)(x - x0).\n\nIf f 0(x0) = 0, then the linear equation\nf(x0) + f 0(x0)(x - x0) = 0,\nhas the unique solution,\nf(x0)\nx1 = x0 -\n.\nf 0(x0)\nNow just keep going (assuming that f 0(xi) is never zero),\nf(x0)\nx1 = x0 - f 0(x0)\nf(x1)\nx2 = x1 - f 0(x1)\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. = .\nxn = xn-1 - f\nf\n(\n(\nx\nx\nn\nn\n-\n-\n)\n) .\nClaim 11.6. Suppose that xinf = limn→inf xn exists and f 0(xinf) == 0\n.\nThen f(xinf) = 0.\nProof of (11.6). Indeed, we have\nxn = xn-1 - f\nf\n(\n(\nx\nx\nn\nn\n-\n-\n)\n) .\nTake the limit as n goes to inf of both sides:\nf(xinf)\nx\n= x\n,\ninf\ninf - f 0(xinf)\nwe we used the fact that f and f 0 are continuous and f 0(xinf) = 0. But\nthen\nf(xinf) = 0,\nas claimed.\n\nSuppose that A ⊂ Rn is open and f : A -→ Rn is a function. Sup\npose that f is C1 (that is, suppose each of the coordinate functions\nf1, f2, . . . , fn is C1).\nThe objective is to find a solution to the equation\nf(P ) = ~0.\nStart with any point P0 ∈ A. The best linear approximation to f at\nP0 is given by\nf(P0) + Df(P0)--→\nPP0.\n\nAssume that Df(P0) is an invertible matrix, that is, assume that\ndet Df(P0) 6= 0. Then the inverse matrix Df(P0)-1 exists and the\nunique solution to the linear equation\nf(P0) + Df(P0)--→\nPP0 = ~0,\nis given by\nP1 = P0 - Df(P0)-1f(P0).\nNotice that matrix multiplication is not commutative, so that there is\na difference between Df(P0)-1f(P0) and f(P0)Df(P0)-1 . If possible,\nwe get a sequence of solutions,\nP1 = P0 - Df(P0)-1f(P0)\nP2 = P1 - Df(P1)-1f(P1)\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. = .\nPn = Pn-1 - Df(Pn-1)-1f(Pn-1).\nSuppose that the limit Pinf = limn→inf Pn exists and that Df(Pinf) is\ninvertible. As before, if we take the limit of both sides, this implies\nthat\nf(Pinf) = ~0.\nLet us try a concrete example.\nExample 11.7. Solve\nx 2 + y 2 = 1\ny = x .\nFirst we write down an appropriate function, f : R2 -→ R2, given\nby f(x, y) = (x2 + y2 - 1, y2 - x3). Then we are looking for a point P\nsuch that\nf(P ) = (0, 0).\nThen\n\n2x\n2y\nDf(P ) =\n.\n-3x\n2y\nThe determinant of this matrix is\n4xy + 6x 2 y = 2xy(2 + 3x).\nNow if we are given a 2 × 2 matrix\na\nb\nc\nd\n,\n\nthen we may write down the inverse by hand,\nd\n-b .\nad - bc -c\na\nSo\n\n2y\n-2y\nDf(P )-1 = 2xy(2 + 3x)\n3x2\n2x\nSo,\n\nDf(P )-1f(P ) =\n2y\n-2y\nx2 +\ny2 -\n2xy(2 + 3x)\n3x\n2x\ny - x\n2x2y - 2y + 2x3y\n= 2xy(2 + 3x) x4 + 3x2y2 - 3x2 + 2xy2\nOne nice thing about this method is that it is quite easy to implement\non a computer.

Suppose that we have\nf : Rn -→ Rm\nand\ng : Rn -→ Rm .\nSuppose that f and g are differentiable at P . What about f + g?\nWell there is a function\na: R2m\n,\n-→ Rm\nwhich sends (~u,~v) ∈ Rm × Rm to the sum ~u + ~v. In coordinates\n(u1, u2, . . . , um, v1, v2, . . . , vm),\na(u1, u2, . . . , um, v1, v2, . . . , vm) = (u1 + v1, u2 + v2, . . . , um + vm).\n\nNow a is differentiable (it is a polynomial, linear even). There is func\ntion\nh: Rn -→ R2m ,\nwhich sends Q to (f(Q), g(Q)). The composition a * h: Rn -→ Rm is\nthe function we want to differentiate, it sends P to f(P ) + g(P ). The\nchain rule says that that the function is differentiable at P and\nD(f + g)(P ) = Df(P ) + Dg(P ).\nNow suppose that m = 1. Instead of a, consider the function\nm: R2 -→ R,\ngiven by m(x, y) = xy. Then m is differentiable, with derivative\nDm(x, y) = (y, x).\nSo the chain rule says the composition of h and m, namely the func\ntion which sends P to the product f(P )g(P ) is differentiable and the\nderivative satisfies the usual rule\nD(fg)(P ) = g(P )D(f)(P ) + f(P )D(g)(P ).\nHere is another example of the chain rule, suppose\nx = r cos θ\ny = r sin θ.\nThen\n∂f\n∂f ∂x\n∂f ∂y\n=\n+\n∂r\n∂x ∂r\n∂y ∂r\n∂f\n∂f\n=\ncos θ +\nsin θ.\n∂x\n∂y\nSimilarly,\n∂f\n∂f ∂x\n∂f ∂y\n=\n+\n∂θ\n∂x ∂θ\n∂y ∂θ\n∂f\n∂f\n= -∂x r sin θ + ∂y r cos θ.\nWe can rewrite this as\n\n∂\n∂\ncos θ\nsin θ\n∂r\n∂x\n∂\n=\n∂\n-r sin θ\nr cos θ\n∂θ\n∂y\nNow the determinant of\ncos θ\nsin θ\n-r sin θ\nr cos θ\n\nis\nr(cos2 θ + sin2 θ) = r.\nSo if r = 0, then we can invert the matrix above and we get\n\n∂\n∂\n1 r cos θ - sin θ\n∂x\n∂r\n∂\n= r\nr sin θ\ncos θ\n∂\n∂y\n∂θ\nWe now turn to a proof of the chain rule. We will need:\nLemma 12.4. Let A ⊂ Rn be an open subset and let f : A -→ Rm be\na function.\nIf f is differentiable at P , then there is a constant M ≥ 0 and δ > 0\nsuch that if k-→\nPQk < δ, then\nkf(Q) - f(P )k < Mk-→\nPQk.\nProof. As f is differentiable at P , there is a constant δ > 0 such that\nif k-→\nPQk < δ, then\nkf(Q) - f(P ) - Df(P )-→\nPQk\nk-→\n< 1.\nPQk\nHence\nkf(Q) - f(P ) - Df(P )-→\nPQk.\nPQk < k-→\nBut then\nkf(Q) - f(P )k = kf(Q) - f(P ) - Df(P )-→\nPQk\nPQ + Df(P )-→\nPQk + kDf(P )-→\nPQk\n≤kf(Q) - f(P ) - Df(P )-→\nPQk + Kk-→\nPQk\n≤ k-→\n= Mk-→\nPQk,\nwhere M = 1 + K.\n\nProof of (12.1). Let's fix some notation. We want the derivative at P .\nLet Q = f(P ). Let P 0 be a point in U (which we imagine is close to\nP ). Finally, let Q0 = f(P 0) (so if P 0 is close to P , then we expect Q0\nto be close to Q).\nThe trick is to carefully define an auxiliary function G: V -→ Rp,\n⎧\n⎨g(Q0)-g(Q)-Dg(Q)(--→\nk--→\nQQ0)\nif Q0 = Q\nG(Q0) = ⎩\nQQ0k\n~0\nif Q0 = Q.\n\nThen G is continuous at Q = f(P ), as g is differentiable at Q.

Implicit functions\nConsider the curve y2 = x in the plane R2 ,\nC = { (x, y) ∈ R2 | y 2 = x }.\nThis is not the graph of a function, and yet it is quite close to the graph\nof a function.\nGiven any point on the graph, let's say the point (2, 4), we can always\nfind open intervals U containing 2 and V containing 4 and a smooth\nfunction f : U -→ V such that C ∩ (U × V ) is the graph of f.\nIndeed, take U = (0, inf), V = (0, inf) and f(x) = √x. In fact,\nwe can do this for any point on the graph, apart from the origin. If\nit is above the x-axis, the function above works. If the point we are\ninterested in is below the x-axis, replace V by (0, -inf) and f(x) = √x,\nby g(x) = -√x.\nHow can we tell that the origin is a point where we cannot define an\nimplicit function? Well away from the origin, the tangent line is not\nvertical but at the origin the tangent line is vertical. In other words, if\nwe consider\nF : R2 -→ R,\ngiven by F (x, y) = y2 - x, so that C is the set of points where F is\nzero, then\nDF (x, y) = (-1, 2y).\nThe locus where we run into trouble, is where 2y = 0. Somewhat\namazingly this works in general:\nTheorem 13.1 (Implicit Function Theorem). Let A ⊂ Rn+m be an\nopen subset and let F : A -→ Rm be a C1-function.

Kepler formulated three\nlaws of planetary motion, based on extensive observations of the recorded\npositions of the planets. The first law states that planets move around\nin ellipses, where the sun is at one focal point of the ellipse; let's see\nhow one can derive this law from Newton's universal law of gravity.\nLet's put the sun at the origin O of our coordinates.

This process converges to a very pointed curve whose length is\ninfinite (in fact this curve is a fractal).\nHowever:\nProposition 15.3.

Consider the function\nf(s) = ~r(s) B~(s) = ~r(s) B~0.\n·\n·\nThen\ndf (s) = d(~r × B~0)(s)\nds\nds\n= T~(s).B~0 = 0.\nSo f(s) is constant. It is zero when ~r(a) = ~0 (the curve passes through\nthe origin) so that f(s) = 0. But then ~r(s) is always orthogonal to a\nfixed vector, so that ~r is contained in a plane, that is, C is planar.\n\nIt is interesting to try to figure out how to characterise curves which\nare contained in spheres or cylinders.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.022 Calculus of Several Variables\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

A vector field on\nA is function F~ : A -→ Rn .\nOne obvious way to get a vector field is to take the gradient of a\ndifferentiable function. If f : A -→ R, then\n,\nrf : A -→ Rn\nis a vector field.\nDefinition 17.2. A vector field F~ : A -→ Rn is called a gradient\n(aka conservative) vector field if F~ = rf for some differentiable\nfunction f : A -→ R.\nExample 17.3. Let\nF~ : R3 -{0} -→ R3 ,\nbe the vector field\n~\ncx\ncy\ncz\nˆ\nF (x, y, z) =\nˆı+\njˆ+\nk,\n(x2 + y2 + z2)3/2\n(x2 + y2 + z2)3/2\n(x2 + y2 + z2)3/2\nfor some constant c. Then F~(x, y, z) is the gradient of\nf : R3 -{0} -→ R,\ngiven by\nc\nf(x, y, z) = -(x2 + y2 + z2)1/2 .\nSo F~ is a conservative vector field. Notice that if c < 0 then F~ models\nthe gravitational force and f is the potential (note that unfortunately\nmathematicians and physicists have different sign conventions for f).\nProposition 17.4. If F~ is a conservative vector field and F~ is C1\nfunction, then\n∂Fi\n∂Fj\n=\n,\n∂xj\n∂xi\nfor all i and j between 1 and n.\nProof. If F~ is conservative, then we may find a differentiable function\nf : A -→ Rn such that\n∂f\nFi =\n.\n∂xi\n\nAs Fi is C1 for each i, it follows that f is C2 . But then\n∂Fi\n∂2f\n=\n∂xj\n∂xj ∂xi\n∂2f\n= ∂xi∂xj\n= ∂Fj .\n\n∂xi\nNotice that (17.4) is a negative result; one can use it show that\nvarious vector fields are not conservative.\nExample 17.5. Let\n~F : R2 -→ R2\ngiven by\n~F (x, y) = (-y, x).\nThen\n∂F1\n∂y = -1\nand\n∂F2\n∂x = 1 6= -1.\nSo ~F is not conservative.\nExample 17.6. Let\nF~ : R2\ngiven by\nF~(x, y) = (y, x + y).\n-→ R2\nThen\n∂F1\n∂F2\n= 1\nand\n= 1,\n∂y\n∂x\nso F~ might be conservative. Let's try to find\nf : R2 -→ R\nsuch that\nrf(x, y) = (y, x + y).\nIf f exists, then we must have\n∂f\n∂f\n= y\nand\n= x + y.\n∂x\n∂y\nIf we integrate the first equation with respect to x, then we get\nf(x, y) = xy + g(y).\nNote that g(y) is not just a constant but it is a function of y. There are\ntwo ways to see this. One way, is to imagine that for every value of y,\nwe have a separate differential equation. If we integrate both sides, we\nget an arbitrary constant c. As we vary y, c varies, so that c = g(y)\nis a function of y. On the other hand, if to take the partial derivatives\n\nof g(y) with respect to x, then we get 0. Now we take xy + g(y) and\ndifferentiate with respect to y, to get\n∂(xy + g(y))\ndg\nx + y =\n= x +\n(y).\n∂y\ndy\nSo\ng0(y) = y.\nIntegrating both sides with respect to y we get\ng(y) = y 2/2 + c.\nIt follows that\nr(xy + y 2/2) = (y, x + y),\nso that F~ is conservative.\nDefinition 17.7. If F~ : A -→ Rn is a vector field, we say that a\nparametrised differentiable curve ~r : I -→ A is a flow line for F~, if\n~r0(t) = F~(~r(t)),\nfor all t ∈ I.\nExample 17.8. Let\nF~ : R2 -→ R2\ngiven by\nF~(x, y) = (-y, x).\nWe check that\n~r : R -→ R2\ngiven by\n~r(t) = (a cos t, a sin t),\nis a flow line. In fact\n~r0(t) = (-a sin t, a cos t),\nand so\nF~(~r(t)) = F~(a cos t, a sin t)\n= ~r0(t),\nso that ~r(t) is indeed a flow line.\nExample 17.9. Let\nF~ : R2 -→ R2\ngiven by\nF~(x, y) = (-x, y).\nLet's find a flow line through the point (a, b). We have\nx0(t) = -x(t)\nx(0) = a\ny0(t) = y(t)\ny(0) = b.\nTherefore,\nx(t) = ae-t\nand\ny(t) = bet ,\ngives the flow line through (a, b).\n\nExample 17.10. Let\nF~ : R2 -→ R2\ngiven by\nF~(x, y) = (x 2 - y 2 , 2xy).\nTry\nx(t) = 2a cos t sin t\ny(t) = 2a sin2 t.\nThen\nx0(t) = 2a(- sin2 t + cost)\nx2(t) - y2(t)\n=\n.\ny(t)\nSimilarly\ny0(t) = 4a cos t sin t\n2x(t)y(t)\n=\n.\ny(t)\nSo\nF~(~r(t))\n~r0(t) =\n.\nf(t)\nSo the curves themselves are flow lines, but this is not the correct\nparametrisation. The flow lines are circles passing through the origin,\nwith centre along the y-axis.\nExample 17.11. Let\nF~ : R2-{(0, 0)} -→ R2\ngiven by\nF~(x, y) = (-x2 +\ny\ny2 , x2 +\nx\ny2 ).\nThen\n∂F1\nx2 + y2\ny2\n(x, y) = -\n- 2y\n=\n- x\n.\n∂y\n(x2 + y2)2\n(x2 + y2)2\nand\n∂F2\nx2 + y2\ny2\n(x, y) =\n- 2x =\n- x\n.\n∂x\n(x2 + y2)2\n(x2 + y2)2\nSo F~ might be conservative. Let's find the flow lines. Try\nt\nx(t) = a cos\na\nt\ny(t) = a sin\n.\na\n\nThen\nt\nx0(t) = - sin\na\na\ny\n.\n= -x2 + y2\nSimilarly\nt\ny0(t) =\ncos\na\na\nx\n=\n.\nx2 + y2\nSo the flow lines are closed curves. In fact this means that F~ is not\nconservative.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.022 Calculus of Several Variables\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

A magnetic field B~ is always the curl of something,\nB~ = curl ~A,\nwhere A~ is a vector field.
