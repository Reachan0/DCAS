Of all our fossil fuel resources (coal, oil, gas), coal is by far the biggest. In the developed world, it is mostly used for electricity production, employing pulverized coal boilers and steam turbines. In the developing world, similar trends are seen, but coal still has significant usage in the industrial and domestic sectors. One consequence of burning carbon based fuels is the emission of carbon dioxide (CO\n) that in turn leads to global warming. While alternatives like solar, wind and biomass have some attractions, they do not, even with large scale expansion, have the potential to address the basic energy, fuel and chemical needs that are currently based on oil and gas. The problem for this class is to address the dilemma: how to burn fossil fuels without the associated environmental impacts?\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis course introduces students to methods and background needed for conceptual design of continuously operating chemical plants. Particular attention is paid to the use of process modeling tools such as AspenPlus(r) that are used in industry and to problems of current interest. Each student team is assigned to evaluate and design a different technology and prepare a final design report.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis course is a senior design course and requires that a student has taken 10.490 Integrated Chemical Engineering I.\n\nTextbooks\n\nThis course has no required text. Two references that you might find useful are:\n\nDouglas, J.\nConceptual Design of Chemical Processes\n. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math, 1988. ISBN: 9780070177628.\n\nSeider, W. D., J. D. Seader, and D. R. Lewin.\nProduct and Process Design Principles: Synthesis, Analysis, and Evaluation\n. 2nd ed. New York, NY: Wiley, 2003. ISBN: 9780471216636.\n\nOrganization\n\nAt the beginning of the term the course will meet for four 1-hour lectures per week. There are two class sessions one from 10-11 and another 11-12. The same material is covered in both classes. After three weeks the Friday class will be used for meetings of each student group and with the instructor. Occasionally classes will be held in the Department of Chemical Engineering Computer Laboratory. Laboratory sessions will begin on the second week of the term and continue until the end of the module.\n\nHomework, Final Report, and Presentation\n\nThere will be approximately 6 homework sets during the beginning of the semester. The homework sets will be due approximately one week after being issued. We strongly encourage students to work in teams. The final solution must be your own work. Shortly after the beginning of the semester you will be formed into teams of four students to work on a design project. Each team will be assigned a different technology to develop/design/evaluate. Each team will write a design report and give a 30-minute presentation to the class and clients.\n\nPolicy For Academic Conduct\n\nThe homework, weekly summaries of progress and the final report have the primary function of helping you learn the material. The secondary function of these assignments is to aid the staff in assessing your understanding of the material, in particular when the time comes to provide a final grade for the course. To this end, the extent to which you collaborate with your colleagues in preparing this material must be understood and agreed upon by both the student team and the staff. The homework assignments are intended nearly exclusively to serve as a learning tool. As such, we are comfortable with collaboration amongst students on the solving of these assignments provided all collaborators are equal contributors to the solution of the problems. You must be prepared to defend your solutions in person if asked by the instructor.\n\nDuring the final semester of senior year you may be involved in job interviews, visits to graduate school and as a result you may not be able to attend all classes or have timing conflicts with homework and project meetings. Please make sure that the instructor is made aware in advance of these conflicts, particularly if there is likely be any delays in turning in homework or in meeting with your project team.\n\nGrading Policy\n\nThe course grade is based on 200 points. Description of the activities can be found in\nassignments\nand\nprojects\n.\n\nThe Design Report grade will be the same for all the group members.\nNo late reports will be accepted\n. The design report grade includes the presentations to class and clients (30 minutes per group).\n\nThe Personal Evaluation grade is a subjective evaluation of each group member and will be composed to two equal parts:\n\nAn evaluation by the instructor of performance in the weekly design meetings.\n\nAn evaluation by your team mates.\n\nIt is to your benefit neither to miss these design meetings, nor to come to them and just sit in. Also, after you submit the report, you will be able to give us your input on the performance of your group members by filling out an evaluation form. This evaluation will be held in confidence, and it will be taken into account for your subjective evaluation.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nDesign Report\n\n75%\n\nProblem Sets\n\n12.5%\n\nPersonal Evaluation\n\n12.5%\n\nCalendar\n\nLEC #\n\nTOPICS\n\nKEY DATES\n\nIntroduction: Global Climate and the CO\nProblem\n\nCourse Overview and Process Design\n\nLiterature Sources for Processes: How to Find Information\n\nStudents assigned to design groups\n\nProcess Flowsheet Models: An Introduction to AspenPlus(r)\n\nProcess Engineering Economics: Project Evaluation\n\nPhysical Property Models: Which One is Best?\n\nHow CO\nis Formed: Combustion Basics\n\nProgress report due\n\nEvaluation of Alternative CO\nRemoval Schemes: Comparing Efficiencies\n\nHierarchical Design Methodology: Reactor Modeling\n\nProcess Flowsheet Models: Reactor Modeling in AspenPlus(r)\n\nProgress report due\n\nProcess Flowsheet Models: Introduction to Analysis Tools\n\nProblem set 1 assigned\n\nChemical Process Safety: HAZOP Analyses\n\nCapital Cost Estimates: Introduction to CAPCOST Software Program\n\n14-27\n\nTeam Project Work\n\nProblem set 1 due in Lec #15\n\nProgress report due in Lec #14, #18, and #22\n\nFinal report due in Lec #26\n\n28-30\n\nStudent Presentations\n\nPresentations due",

In many cases you will have to\nmake assumptions in order to solve the problems - please make sure that you document\nthem very carefully. You can either do the modeling calculations by hand or preferably use\nAspen. Many of the needed building blocks have been built in the Aspen workshops. For\nthis problem set you may work together with your project team but I expect you to turn in\nyour own solution - the critical point is to make sure that you understand the solution.\nProblem Number 1.1 - Order of Magnitude Estimation\nA recent book on energy trends made a claim that sometime in 2006 the world consumption\nof oil would exceed 1000 barrels/second! Conduct a literature search and determine if this\nestimate is true. Please document your sources. (A barrel is a standard unit of volume in the\noil industry and is equivalent to 42 US gallons or approximately 159 liters.)\nProblem Number 1.2 - Energy Required to Generate Electricity and to Separate CO2 from a\nGas Stream\nA 500 MW power plant uses a bituminous coal, with an effective molecular formula of\nCH0.8S0.008, to generate steam in a boiler that is in turn released into a turbine to generate\nelectricity. If you assume that the combustion can be represented by the overall stoichiometry\nand that the residence time is long enough to enable complete combustion.\na) Compare the coal composition C/H ratio against the one used in the Aspen\nworkshop, what do you conclude?\nb) If there is 15% excess air, write down the overall stoichiometry for the combustion\noccurring inside the boiler. Assume that the sulfur reacts to sulfur trioxide (SO3)\nc) Estimate the heat release per kg of coal (calculate both the LHV and HHV) and\ncompare your results for coal against those we discussed in class for methane. What\ndo you conclude?\nd) Using the composition of the exhaust gas from the boiler estimate the energy\nrequired to separate CO2 from the output stream. You will have to assume\nappropriate exit conditions. Repeat the calculation for the case where the oxidant is\npure oxygen.\ne) Make a plot of the amount of coal needed to generate 500 MW of power as a function\nof the boiler thermal efficiency with and without CO2 capture. What do you\nconclude?\n\nSpring 2006\nProblem Number 1.3 - A First Order Model of a Power Plant\nA very simplified schematic of a power plant is shown in the figure below. Using the\nmodules that you developed in the Aspen workshops (boiler, turbine, CO2 removal, etc.)\nconstruct a working Aspen model of the power plant.\nBoiler/\nHeat\nRecovery\nSteam\nGenerator\nCoal\nAir\nFlue Gas\nFly Ash and Sulfur\nSteam\nRecycle Steam\nTurbine\nSystem\nGenerator Electricity\nStack\nFlue Gas\nGas clean\nup to\nremove\nSOx and\nParticles\nCO2 Removal\nSystem\nCO2\nBoiler/\nHeat\nRecovery\nSteam\nGenerator\nCoal\nAir\nFlue Gas\nFly Ash and Sulfur\nSteam\nRecycle Steam\nTurbine\nSystem\nGenerator Electricity\nStack\nFlue Gas\nGas clean\nup to\nremove\nSOx and\nParticles\nCO2 Removal\nSystem\nBoiler/\nHeat\nRecovery\nSteam\nGenerator\nBoiler/\nHeat\nRecovery\nSteam\nGenerator\nCoal\nCoal\nAir\nAir\nFlue Gas\nFly Ash and Sulfur\nSteam\nRecycle Steam\nTurbine\nSystem\nTurbine\nSystem\nGenerator Electricity\nStack\nFlue Gas\nGas clean\nup to\nremove\nSOx and\nParticles\nCO2 Removal\nSystem\nCO2\nFigure 1.3a Schematic representation of a coal fired power plant.\nThe goal of developing the Aspen model is to use it as a basis for some very preliminary\ndesign calculations. In particular:\na.\nUsing the coal composition employed in the Aspen work shop on modeling\ndevelop a simple Aspen flowsheet for a system whose power output is 500 MW.\nUse a boiler thermal efficiency of 40% as a design basis. (In the initial design do\nnot worry about the treatment of the recycled steam)\nb.\nEstimate the energy requirements for CO2 capture.\nc.\nEstimate the adiabatic flame temperature for a coal/O2 feed.\nd.\nIf the maximum temperature inside the boiler under oxygen firing conditions is\nto be kept below 1200 K how much of the exhaust gas would have to be recycled\nto cool the boiler.\nNote to students: The problem statement is purposely vague, you will have to make\nassumptions about the level of detail, and how to treat the individual unit operations. In\naddition I want you to keep to the time allocated for study/home work in this class. The\ngoal is to do the best that you can do in the time available, not to work yourself into\nexhaustion as there are a lot of other project related activities to be completed."

Its importance can hardly\nbe overemphasized because the acceptance of its conclusions and recommendations by management\ndepends so strongly on the impression it makes. An excellent plant design is not very useful if its\npresentation fails to convince management that the project should be undertaken. Therefore the design\nreport should be written with the reader in mind. It should convince the reader that\n\n-\nThe work was done well.\n-\nThe conclusions and recommendations are reasonable and valid.\n\nTo this end the report should\n\n-\nPresent conclusions and recommendations clearly and convincingly;\n-\nJustify properly major decision such as the flowsheet selection;\n-\nDescribe accurately and clearly (these are not the same) the development of ideas and the methods\nemployed in arriving at the final design.\n\nSince the reader is so important, the writer must consider\n\n-\nWho will read the report? Why?\n-\nWhat are the responsibilities of the reader?\n-\nHow much background information does the reader have?\n-\nWhat is his/her technical competence?\n\nA PROCEDURE FOR PREPARING THE REPORT\n\n1.\nDefine the subject matter, scope of the work, and intended audience. Try to envision what each of these\nneeds in the report.\n\n2.\nPrepare a checklist for the report.\n\n3.\nPrepare an outline, listing actual headings and subheadings. Under each subdivision list the topics to be\ndiscussed.\n\n4.\nExpand the outline in one or more steps. Write a sentence or two under each subdivision summarizing\nthe ideas or information to be discussed.\n\n5.\nWrite the first draft. Do not pay too much attention to grammar or style - concentrate on saying what\nneeds to be said.\n\n6.\nRevise and polish the first draft. If possible lay it aside for a few days, then review it again and polish.\nIf time is short, have someone other than the author criticize the writing.\n\n7.\nGet report typed, PROOF READ, and check all details carefully. Note: you most likely will run out of\ntime, so be forewarned and prepare a schedule at the onset providing ample time to assemble the\nreport. Don't cut short the time for the report unless absolutely necessary.\n\nICE 10.491\n1 of 4\nSpring 2006\n\nOUTLINE OF THE REPORT\n\nLETTER OF TRANSMITTAL - This cover letter indicates the purpose and reports the results specifically\nrequested. Address it to the commissioner of the report.\n\nTITLE PAGE - Title of the report; addresses; authors; organization; date.\n\nABSTRACT - A clear, concise statement of essential findings and results, along with conclusions and\nrecommendations. A single page should suffice.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS - Headings, subheadings, list of figures and titles, appendices, page numbers.\n\nBODY\n\n1.\nIntroduction - a discussion of the subject of the report and why it was done.\n\n2.\nBackground - a survey of relevant literature.\nDetails of references mentioned in the Discussion should be reported here, but confine mention of\nthe current work to the Discussion.\n\n3. Discussion - a description of the design.\nAddress the technical reader in this section. The goal is to justify major decisions, and convey how\nthe authors arrived at the design and an understanding of the principles on which the process is\nbased. Organization of this section depends on the particular process, but should include\n\n-\nBasis of design: a precise statement of the problem, including feed compositions, product\nspecifications, available utilities.\n\n-\nAlternatives considered. Why were other processes rejected?\nHow did you select your flowsheet structure? Simple sketches for this section are helpful.\n\n-\nA brief description of proposed process with a qualitative flowsheet.\n\n-\nAssumptions, limitations of the design, possible sources of error.\n\n-\nDiscussion of major equipment or sections of the process and the technical considerations\nwhich led to its selection and configuration.\n\n-\nGraphs, drawings, and tables necessary to understand the discussion. Place non-essential\nmaterial in an appendix. Insert each figure as near as possible to the text in which it is\nfirst mentioned. Constant flipping of pages makes for difficult reading. Also, present\nyour heat exchanger network in a separate figure.\n\n-\nAnalysis of economics of the process. Include cost diagrams, pie charts and include a\nsimple sensitivity analysis.\n\n4. The Design - a compilation of the facts.\n\n4.1 Flowsheet - a complete quantitative flowsheet drawn on a single large page. Include heat duties of\nexchangers. Label all streams and equipment.\n\n4.2 Material and energy balances (stream information table) - Report for each stream its temperature,\npressure, competent flow rates, total flow rate, and vapor fraction. Every stream must have a\nseparate entry in the table. Streams differing only in pressure, temperature, or vapor fraction\nshould appear in adjacent columns: only the changed quantities need to appear for the\ndownstream entries. Include utilities and make-up streams. The stream information table must\nICE 10.491\n2 of 4\nSpring 2006\n\nreside on a single page, and should include the scale-up factor and units used for pressure,\ntemperature, etc. If possible, place the stream table on the same page as the flowsheet.\n\n4.3 Equipment list and specifications.\n\n4.4 Economic information - include as appropriate:\nCapital investment\nUtilities summary\nManufacturing cost\nEstimate of Annual Earnings and Return\nNet Present Value\n\n5.\nConclusions- itemized and concisely stated. No arguments should appear here, and all items must be\nsupported and explained in prior sections.\n\n6.\nRecommendations for Future Work -- The recommendations for future work are especially important.\nBecause of the short time available for the project you will not have been able to address all the\npotentially interesting/relevant topics. In practice another team might take over the detailed design\nand it is important that you help them come up to speed as quickly as possible by identifying important\nremaining issues.\n\n7.\nFlowsheet - a complete quantitative flowsheet drawn on a single large page. Include heat duties of\nexchangers. Label all streams and equipment.\n\n8.\nNomenclature - symbols and units.\n\n9.\nReferences - format of AIChE J.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nA. Calculations - include an index. Include a complete calculation for every major piece of\nequipment. For minor or frequently-occurring, similar equipment such as heat exchangers and\ncompressors, a single representative calculation is sufficient. A complete calculation compresses a\nmass and energy balance, sizing, and costing. Each calculation must refer to specific equipment in\nthe flowsheet and must represent the values which appear in the flow sheet.\n\nB.\nDerivations\n\nC. Auxiliary tables, figures, graphs\n\nD. Supplementary material\n\nA CHECK LIST FOR THE REPORT\n\nOVERALL:\n\n1.\nIs it well-organized?\n2.\nReadable?\n3.\nUnderstandable by principal readers?\n4.\nHas manuscript been edited ruthlessly?\n5.\nProofread by writer? Others?\n6.\nIs pagination correct?\n\nABSTRACT:\n\n1.\nAre conclusions and recommendations clearly valid and well-substantiated?\n2.\nAre they presented clearly and convincingly? Are they concise? Rambling presentations, even\nthough accurate, are undesirable.\n3.\nAre they supported by the rest of the report?\nICE 10.491\n3 of 4\nSpring 2006\n\nBODY:\n\n1.\nIs the reason for the project stated clearly?\n2.\nAre the objectives stated clearly?\n3.\nIs earlier work considered and described accurately?\n4.\nIs the flowsheet selection properly justified?\n5.\nIs the work itself described adequately?\n6.\nAre sufficient data (not too many) included to make the report understandable and to support\nconclusions?\n7.\nAre table, graphs, etc. organized neatly and readably?\n8.\nAre assumptions, limitations, and sources of error identified and evaluated?\n\nAPPENDICES:\n\n1.\nAre they complete?\n2.\nAre they organized so the reader can turn readily from the main body of the report and find\nwhat he/she is looking for?\n\nGRADING OF THE DESIGN REPORT\n\nEach report will be read by two teaching assistants and by the instructor. Grades and comments\nwill be recorded on separate sheets, so the gradings will be independent. The grade of the report will be the\narithmetic mean of the grades assigned by the readers. However, if the grades greatly differ, the instructor\nwill confer in an effort to resolve the disparity.\n\nEach section of the report will be scored on a scale of 0 to 5. The raw score will be weighted\naccording to the importance of the section to obtain the contribution to the total grade. A section written\nwith no major mistakes will receive a score of 3. Omissions, technical errors, and so forth lower the score;\nevidence of special care, insight, or clarity of exposition will increase.\n\nThe graders will assume the role of a non-technical reader when grading the Letter of Transmittal,\nAbstract, Introduction, Economic discussion, and Conclusion. The remaining sections will be judged from\nthe perspective of a technically competent engineer.\n\nThe score of the Technical discussion will reflect the quality of presentation and justification of the\ndesign. The score for the Flowsheet will include an assessment of the quality of the design itself.\n\nThe criterion for evaluating the Calculations will be, \"Can I (the reader) reproduce these results?\nDo I know the assumptions that produced them, and are the assumptions reasonable for a preliminary\ndesign?\" Explanations of the Calculations belong in the Technical discussion. The Calculations need only\nshow which numbers were used in what equations. If you used the computer, include a transcript of the\ndialog and indicate how you used the computed results to determine sizes and costs.\n\nIMPORTANT CAVEATS\n\nThis class is about process design. One of the most important features of solutions to design problems is that\nthe answers are typically not unique - usually there is no 'correct answer' nor is the answer in the back of the\nbook. The design process is further complicated by missing or conflicting information, ambiguous\nobjectives, and no clear problem statement. As a result:\n1.\nYou will have to make a lot of assumptions, document them, understand the implications and then\nmove on.\n2.\nKeep to the time limit imposed by the units allocated to this class - the goal is to do the best that\nyou can in the allocated time, not to exhaust yourself. Time management is critical.\n3.\nThis is a team effort, plan and allocate the work across all members, meet regularly and iterate the\ndesign concepts.\nICE 10.491\n4 of 4\nSpring 2006"

Most of the existing power plants in the US and for that matter\naround the world do not have any CO2 capture technologies installed. Your task is to\nassess chemical looping as a way to lower CO2 emissions and in particular to see if it\ncould be used to retrofit existing coal fired power plants. You assignment for this next\nweek is to develop a suitable option and develop a plan of attack.\n\nYou are not to discuss with your class mates either the technology you have been asked\nto evaluate or your findings as you progress with your designs. A separate handout\ndescribes the structure of the final report."
