  "course_description": "24.901 is designed to give you a preliminary understanding of how the sound systems of different languages are structured, how and why they may differ from each other. The course also aims to provide you with analytical tools in phonology, enough to allow you to sketch the analysis of an entire phonological system by the end of the term. On a non-linguistic level, the course aims to teach you by example the virtues of formulating precise and explicit descriptive statements; and to develop your skills in making and evaluating arguments.",

      "content": "Phonetic Exercises using Praat -3\nFinnish length\nFinnish contrasts both long and short vowels and consonants. Listen to the muta sound file. It\nconsists of four contrasting lexical items that all have the same four sounds [muta]. They differ\nin terms of whether the first vowel is long or short and the medial consonant is long or short.\nListen to them several times and then transcribe them. Then examine the sound waves and\nmeasure the duration of the [u] and [t] in each one. Which duration contrast has greater\ndispersion, short vs. long [u] or short vs. long [t]?\n[u]\n[t]\n1. muta\n______\n_________\n'mud'\n2. muta\n______\n________\n'else'\n3. muta\n______\n_______\n'but'\n4. muta\n______\n_______\n'to change'\nThe second Finnish sound file contains kansa 'people' followed by kanssa 'together with'.\nMeasure the durations of [an] and [s] in both words. It is commonly said that Finnish geminate\nconsonants span a syllable boundary so that 'together with' would be parsed [kans.sa]. Do your\nmeasurements support this hypothesis? How?\nYoruba Tone∗\nYoruba contrasts three tone levels. Drag your cursor across the vowel and then use the \"Get\nPitch\" command (F5) under the dropdown Pitch menu to measure the average pitch of the\nfollowing three verbs.\nAv F0\nba!\n'meet'\n______\nHz\nba\"\n'hide'\n______\nba#\n'take'\n______\nThe next set of three show these verbs preceded by the 3rd person pronoun o!. In one case there\nis an assimilatory effect of the tone of one syllable on the other. Which case is this? Is the\nassimilatory effect anticipatory or perseverative? Finally, these verbs were recorded as sets of\nthree items. Do you see any effects of \"list intonation\"? What are they?\n∗ Since this is a male voice, adjust your pitch settings to a range of 50-200 Hz.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n24.901 Language and Its Structure I: Phonology\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Under Formant Settings, for a\nmaximum, set it at 5500 Hz for a female voice and 5000 Hz for a male voice. You can play with the\nnumber of formants shown from 3 to 5 to see what kind of screen resolution you get. For the VOT measure\nyou must try to find the burst; for labials this may be weak. Listen to the signal as you try to decide where\nto take your measure. For F0 (fundamental freq) look under the Pitch menu. Show Pitch toggles back and\nforth with a blue line on the spectrogram. For the settings use 70 Hz for minimum and 200 Hz for a\nmaximum for a male voice. You can simply click on the first blue dot in the vowel and a pitch measure in\nHz (e.g. 111Hz) will appear on the right margin of the screen. You can use command x to delete, command\nc to copy and command v to paste. For the last exercise where you are asked to delete the s, it might be\nadvisable to copy and paste the spill, still, skill somewhere at the end of the entire wave first before doing\nthe deletions.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n24.901 Language and Its Structure I: Phonology\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

If the alternations are systematic\nthen we posit a single underlying representation for the stem and affix and derive the various\nsurface alternants by ordered rules. The study of alternations is a primary vehicle to discover the\nrules of the grammar. Certain general principles guide the analysis of alternations.\n2. given a ! b, analytic alternatives:\ni. /a/ is underlying and is changed to [b] in some context\nii. /b/ is underlying and changed to [a] in the complementary set of contexts\niii. both [a] and [b] derive from /c/ with two rules: c -> a and c -> b\n-\nchoice among the alternatives is guided by the simplicity and plausibility of the rules\nand the coherence of the overall analysis\n3. predictability:\nif one set of lexical items exhibit an alternation between sound [a] and sound [b]\nand another set has stable, non-alternating [a] then try positing /b/ as underlying\nthe alternating set, with rule /b/ -> in some context\n4.

      "content": "24.901\nFeature Geometry\n- -.\n,\no&~Y,aclF,\n[I] In the early generative model the distinctive features formed an unordered bundle; research in\nthe 1980's suggested that the features were organized into a dependency tree with the root node at\nthe top and many features as leaves at the terminal nodes. Various intermediary levels of\norganization were also postulated. A new format for the formalization of phonological rules was\nalso proposed based on this notation. It was hoped that this \"feature\"geometry would help to\nrestrict the range of possible rules. We follow here the model proposed by Halle (1992).\n[2] major pieces of the structure\n*\nroot node is location of major class features [cons] and [sonorant] that partition sounds\ninto vowels vs. consonants and obstruents vs. sonorants\nvarious terminal features are the dependents of six articulators that are the principle actors\nin the production of speech: Labial, Coronal, Dorsal, Soft Palate, Radical, Glottal\nthe articulators are grouped into a cavity specification where the constriction is formed:\noral, nasal, pharyngeal\ncertain manner (stricture) features more or less freely cross-classify the articulators and are\noff to side of the root node\n(3) [round]\nLabial\n[later]\n->-\nCoronal\n[dtstrib]\n[back]\n[high]*\nDorsal\n[low1\n[cons]\n[sonor]\n[nasal]\nSoft Palate\nNasal\nI:\",::\n, \" ?Glottal\n[voiced]\nterminal features articulator\ncavity\nstricture\nroot\n[3] overview and motivation\ncertain recurrent groups of features in rules of assimilation and reduction\nthese groups are dominated by some node in the feature tree\n\nassimilation formalized as \"spreading\" of a tree node to the corresponding node in a neighboring\nsegment; reduction formalized as the elimination of some tree node in the segment\n*\nsegments linked to a timing tier of X slots that represent the linear order of speech sounds\nlength/geminate contrast is represented as one root node of feature tree linked/associated\nto two successive timing slots\n[4] Assimilation types\nnasal assimilation: a nasal acquires the place features of a following (oral) consonant but\nnot it's manner features like [lateral] or [continuant]\nCatalan (simplified)\nso[n] amics\n'they are friends'\nbilabial\nso[m] pocs\n'they are few'\ndental\nso[g] dos\n'they are two'\nalveolar\nso[n] sincers\n'they are sincere'\npalatal\nso[ii] [lY]iures 'they are free'\nvelar\nso[g] grans\n'they are big'\nrule\n[+cons]\n[+cons1\n/\n\"\"\" .....,........I\nNasal\nOral\nOral\ndotted line in rule denotes the spreading node; = denotes the delinked node\n*\nwhatever articulator Oral dominates (Labial, Coronal, Dorsal) becomes the articulator for\nthe preceding nasal\n*\npredicts no assimilation for a nasal preceding a pharyngeal or laryngeal consonant (cf.\nSudanese Arabic p. 158\nregressive assimilation in general: node X acquires the same feature specification as node\nY, losing its original specification\nX\nY\n+'.\"\".....<....,.,,I\n[Fl\n[F]\ne.g. five but fif-th where [F] = [voice] and X and Y = Glottal\nprogressive assimilation:\nnode Y aquires the same feature specification as node X\nlosing its original specification\n\ne.g, dog-[z] vs. cat-[sl where [F] = [voice]\ncomplete assimilation\nArabic sun and moon letters\n?al-qamr\n'the moon'\n?aJ-anls\n'the sun'\n?al-faras\n'the horse'\n?ad-daar\n'the house'\n?al-kitaab\n'the book'\n?az-zayt\n'the oil'\n?a]-harb\n'the war'\n?an-nahr\n'the river'\n?al-ab\n'the father'\n?aO-8awb\n'the garment'\ntiming tier\nX,,,\nX\nf\n\"\"-....,, I\n[+cons] [+ cons]\n/\nI\n[+ lateral]\nOral\nCoronal\nlateral consonant of definite prefix is replaced by following coronal consonant\n[ 5 ] assimilation without delinking\nlow tone spread in Buli: a high tone [A] becomes rising [g] after a low tone [A]\nmid tone [S] neither undergoes nor triggers the rule\nfi:k\n'small'\nbag fi:k\n'small lizard'\nz i 'millet'\nw i 25\n'his millet'\nl2m 'meat'\nwA lam\n'his meat'\nniim 'grind'\nniim z6\n'grind millet'\nci\n(I\nsyllable tier\n[ +lo]\n[ + hi]\ntonal tier\nas a result of this rule the second syllable is associated with two tonal specifications: lo\nfollowed by hi which is a natural representation for a rise; similarly hi followed by lo\nassociated to same syllable is a natural representation for a falling tone\n\n[6] reduction deletion of part of tree without replacement\nreduction of unstressed vowels to schwa in English (Flem~zing2004)\nRosa's roses [a] ....
