Topics include demand estimation, capacity planning and process analysis, inventory management, and supply chain coordination and performance. We also cover issues specific to emerging markets, such as sustainable supply chains, how to couple product design with supply chain design and operation, and how to account for the value-adding role of a supply chain. A major aspect of class is the student projects on supply chain design or improvement.\n\nClass will be a mix of lectures, experiential games and cases. The course objectives are to develop an understanding of the challenges in the design and planning of supply chains, and to learn modeling skills and problem-solving tools, applicable to the design and planning of supply chains. Students conduct projects related to the introduction of a new product or service into a developing economy.\n\nCourse requirements are to come to class prepared, and to participate in the class. There will be a number of individual assignments throughout the class and a group project. The grading will depend on the assignments, contribution to the class and project.\n\nText\n\nMost of the class material will be posted on the class web site.\nWe do ask that you buy and read\nGoldratt, et al.\nThe Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement\n.

Homework must be submitted in hard copy before the beginning of the class on the day that it is due. If you anticipate problems handing in an assignment on time, contact the instructor in advance; late work will be reduced by half a grade each day unless an extension has been granted 24 hours prior to the due date. We expect all students to attend all classes. If you cannot attend a particular class session, you should contact the instructor prior to the class. No more than two unexcused absences are allowed.\n\nMore specifically, there are the following assignments:\n\nFour individual problem sets (forecasting; capacity planning and process analysis; inventory; contracts and procurement)\n\nSeven individual one-page write-ups (SC example; Beer Game; The Goal; the OPT game; the Supply Chain game; Jiro Dreams of Sushi; and the Malaria SC case). Each of the\nindividual write-ups\nshould be at most 500 words.\n\nGroup project (2 or 3 person groups)\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nFour individual problem set\n\n25%\n\nSeven individual one-page write-ups\n\n25%\n\nGroup project\n\n35%\n\nClass participation\n\n15%\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nThe rules of the MIT Faculty state: \"The attempt of any student to present as his or her own the work of another, or any work which he or she has not honestly performed, or to pass any examination by improper means, is regarded by the Faculty as a most serious offense, and renders the offender liable to immediate expulsion. The aiding and abetting of a student in any dishonesty is likewise held to be a great breach of discipline.\"\n\nIn the context of this class, we expect you to work in groups; but groups should work independently and should not consult with each other about a particular assignment.\n\nIf you are uncertain about any aspect or instance of this policy, please ask one of the instructors for clarification.",

The color of the task shows which robot completes each task, if two\ndifferent tasks are done by the same robot, they cannot be completed at the same time.\nThe controls along the top include \"quit\" \"info\" and \"speed\". \"Quit\" allows you to stop the game at any\ntime. \"Info\" will give you information and statistics about your run of the simulation. \"Speed\" controls\nhow fast the simulation progresses, to start simply slide the speed slider to any position other than 0.\nAlso along the top you will see you current amounts of cash and the current time.\n\nEach individual task gives you controls that enable you to work with that task specifically\nIn the top left and right corners, you will see information about the inputs\nand outputs respectively, including both their names and how many there\ncurrently are in that queue.\nThe top bar shown here in yellow, will change to green when the task has\nbeen set up, and there is a blue loading bar that shows how close it is to\neither finishing set-up, or finishing processing an item.\nIf you click in the center, the task will turn on and the setup process will\nstart. You will be able to see that it is on, because the picture will turn into\nan animation, and the words will change to turn off.\nAt the bottom you have the ability to buy the inputs and sell the outputs, if\nthose inputs and outputs can be bought and sold.\nAt the bottom of each task you see a button that says \"Info. / Controls.\"\nThis button allows you to access more controls for the task.\nThis menu will open up when that button is pressed.\nAt the top it will show the information about the task.\nBelow that it enables you to be able to buy more than one item at a time.\nSimply set the slider at any value between 1 and 100 to buy that amount.\n\"Sell all\" allows you to sell as many items in the output queue as you can.\n\"Push\" moves the items in the output queue to the input queue of the\nnext task. Again you can set how many you want to do at a time using the\nslider. Also if one task outputs to two different tasks, then here is where\nyou will find the controls for which task it will push to. Below that you\nwill find a button that here says \"Manuel\"; clicking this button will switch\nit to \"Auto\" which means that everything in the output queue will\nautomatically be pushed forward.\n\nAt the end of each period a popup will show you how you are doing.\nThe game will end when you either run out of time, or can't pay your bills, or press quit. When the\ngame ends you have the option of saving, which will save a text file of how you did into the same\ndirectory as the game, and the option to reset, which will bring you back to the first screen.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.772J / EC.733J D-Lab: Supply Chains\nFall 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Your first\ntask is to analyze the Kenyan market and you receive data on the total number of mobile\nphone users in Kenya for every year since 1997.\n1.\nUse the Bass diffusion model to estimate total market size N, and also the innovation\nand imitation parameters, p, and q. Do the estimated values make sense? How would\nthese parameters affect your marketing strategy? Note: the data is in the file Kenya-\nMobile-2005.csv.\n2.\nSeven years pass, and now you have data up until 2011 about the Kenyan mobile\nphone market. How do your estimates compare with what actually happened? Why do\nyou think your estimate is different from reality? Note: the data is in the file Kenya-\nMobile-today.csv.\nProblem 2 - Monthly Rainfall in India\n1.\nPlot the data. Is there a seasonal pattern? Is there trend?\n2.\nFollowing the method below, use the data to estimate the monthly seasonal factors for\nthe average rainfall in India.\n3.\nUsing an appropriate exponential smoothing model, forecast the monthly average\nrainfall for 2011. How accurate do you respect the forecast to be?\nA Method for Estimating Seasonal Factors:\n1.\nCompute the sample mean for the all the data.\n2.\nDivide each observation by the sample mean. This gives seasonal factors for each\nperiod of observed data.\n3.\nAverage the factors for each month. That is, average all the factors corresponding to\nJanuary, all the factors corresponding to February, and so on. The resulting averages\nare the 12 multiplicative seasonal factors. They should add to 12.\nProblem 3 - Supermarket Sales in Brazil\n1.\nPlot the data. Is there a seasonal pattern? Is there trend?\n\n2.\nUsing the data, estimate the trend and the seasonal factors. Comment: There are many\nways to do this. However, it might be easier to first estimate the trend and mean using\nlinear regression and then calculate the seasonal factors.\n3.\nUsing an appropriate exponential smoothing model for the years 2003-2010, forecast\nthe monthly sales volume in 2011? How accurate do you expect the forecast to be?\nProblem 4 - Your project\n1.\nWhat are the characteristics of the demand for the product or service sold by your\npartner company? Is there seasonality? Is there a trend?\n2.\nWhat data do you need to build a demand model?\n3.\nIs the Bass model appropriate for measuring adoption of this product? If yes, what\ndata do you need to fit it? If not, why?\n4.\nCan one of the methods covered in class be used to predict demand in your project? If\nyes, which one? If not, why?\n5.\nPropose a demand model and a forecasting strategy to estimate demand in your\nproject. What are the inputs and outputs of this model? How would you validate it with\nreal data?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.772J / EC.733J D-Lab: Supply Chains\nFall 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "EC.733 D-Lab: Supply Chains Fall 2014\n\nProblem Set 2 - Process Analysis\n\nProblem 1 - Window Boxes\nMetal window boxes are manufactured in two process steps: stamping and assembly. Each\nwindow box is made up of three parts or pieces: a base part (part A) and two side panels or\nparts (two part B's). The parts are fabricated by a single stamping machine that requires a setup\ntime of 120 minutes whenever switching between the two part types. Once the machine is set\nup, the activity (or production) time for each part A is one minute while the activity time for\neach part B is only 30 seconds. Currently, the stamping machine rotates its production\nbetween one batch of 360 units for part A and one batch of 720 units for part B.\n\nCompleted parts move from the stamping machine to the assembly only after the entire batch\nis complete. At assembly, parts are assembled manually to form the finished product. One\nbase (part A) and two sides (two part Bs) , as well as a number of small purchased components,\nare required for each unit of the final product. Each product requires 27 minutes of labor time\nto assemble. There are currently 12 workers in assembly. There is sufficient demand to sell\nevery box the system can make.\n\n1. What is the capacity of the stamping machine?\n2. What batch sizes would you recommend for the process?\n\nProblem 2 - Little's Law\n\nLittle's Law states the fundamental relationship between the average flow time, T, the\nthroughput rate, R, and the average inventory I. Namely, it states that\n\nI\nR\nT\n=\n×\n\n(I is measured in units of inventory; R is units of inventory per unit time; and T is in units of\ntime).\n\nUsing Little's Law, answer the following questions:\n1. An insurance company receives 10,000 claims per year. Average processing time is three\nweeks. How many claims are being processed at any given point?\n2. A major manufacturer sells $300 million worth of cellular equipment per year. The average\namount in accounts receivable is $45 million. How much time (on average) elapses from the\ntime a customer is billed to the time payment is received?\n\n3. Auto-Moto Financial Services provides financing to qualified buyers of new cars and\nmotorcycles. Having just revamped its application-processing operations, Auto-Moto Financial\nServices is now evaluating the effect of its changes on service performance. Auto-Moto receives\nabout 1,000 loan applications per month and makes accept/reject decisions based on an\nextensive review of each application. Assume a 30-day working month.\n\nUntil last year, Auto-Moto Financial Services processed each application individually. On\naverage, 20% of all applications received approval. An internal audit showed that, on average,\nAuto-Moto had about 500 applications in process at various stages of the approval/rejection\nprocedure. How long does an application spend on average with Auto-Moto before receiving\nan accept/reject decision?\n\n4. After numerous complaints, Auto-Moto hires a consulting company to help streamline the\ndecision making process. The consultants quickly identified a key problem: although most\napplications could be processed fairly quickly, some - because of insufficient and/or unclear\ndocumentation - took a disproportionate amount of time. They suggested the following\nchanges to the process:\na) Because the percentage of approved applications is fairly low, an Initial Review Team should\nbe set up to preprocess all applications according to strict but fairly mechanical guidelines;\nb) Each application would fall into three categories: A (looks excellent), B (needs more detailed\nevaluation), and C (reject summarily). A and B applications would be forwarded to different\nspecialist subgroups.\nc) Each subgroup would then evaluate the applications in its domain and make accept/reject\ndecisions.\n\nThe new process was implemented in an experimental basis. The company found that, on\naverage, 25% of all applications were As, 25% were Bs, and 50% were Cs. Typically, about\n70% of all As and 10% of all Bs were approved on review (all Cs were rejected.) Internal audit\nchecks further revealed that, on average, 200 applications were with the Initial Review Team\nundergoing preprocessing. Just 25, however, were with the Subgroup A Team undergoing the\nnext stage of processing and about 150 with Subgroup B team.\nWhat is the average flow time of each type of application?\n\n5. Continuing the previous question, what is the average flow time for a randomly selected\napplication? Should Auto-Moto Financial Services adopt the recommendation?\n\nProblem 3 - Class Project\n1. Draw a process flow diagram for one of the processes that exists in your partner company.\n2. What data do you need to identify the bottleneck?\n3. Is a pull system appropriate for this process? What would be a reasonable batch size?\n4. Create a spreadsheet model that identifies the bottleneck, the cycle time, and the WIP as a\nfunction of the throughput rate of each activity. (make up data if and as needed - for illustrative\npurposes)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.772J / EC.733J D-Lab: Supply Chains\nFall 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Each table costs $50 to make. Assuming the fixed order placement costs to\nbe $5/order, the holding cost rate to be 30% of the table cost per year, and the lead time to\nbe 4 weeks, determine the optimal order quantity and the average annual inventory-\nrelated costs (assume a month has 4 weeks).\nProblem 2\nEcoTable is a retailer of specialty organic and ecologically friendly foods. In one of their\nCambridge, MA, stores, they plan to offer a gift basket of Tanzanian teas for the holiday\nseason. They plan on placing a single order prior to the holiday season and any leftover\ninventory will be discounted at the end of the season. Demand for this store is estimated to\nhave a Poisson distribution with an average of 4.5 units (values for this probability\ndistribution are shown in Table 1).

Geoff offers Land's End two\npurchasing options:\n-\nOption 1: Geoff offers to sell the glasses to Land's End at $65 per unit; he also agrees\nto credit Land's End $53 for each unit Land's End returns to Geoff at the end of the\nseason (because those units did not sell). Since styles change each year, there is\nessentially no value in the returned merchandise.\n-\nOption 2: Geoff offers a price of $55 for each unit, but returns are no longer accepted.\nIn this case, Land's End throws out unsold units at the end of the season.\nThis season's demand for the model will be normally distributed with mean of 200 and\nstandard deviation of 125. Land's End will sell those sunglasses for $100 each.

The shirts, which bear the store\nlabel, are shipped from a manufacturer in China. Hi, the proprietor, says ``I want to be sure\n\nthat I never run out of dress shirts. I always try to keep at least two months supply in stock.\nWhen my inventory drops below that level, I order another two month supply. I've been\nusing that method for 20 years and it works!\" The shirts cost $8 each and sell for $25 each.\nThe cost of processing an order and receiving new goods amounts to $80 and the\nreplenishment lead time is one month.

Graves 2014\n\nDemand Management\n(c) Stephen C. Graves 2014\n\nWhat is demand?\nFrom the Merriam-Webster dictionary,\nDemand is the quantity of a commodity or\nservice wanted at a specified price and time.\n- How can we deal with demand from a SC\npoint of view?\n- Why is anticipating demand important?\n(c) Stephen C. Graves 2014\n\nWhy forecast? - Two SC strategies\nTwo supply chain strategies for dealing with\ndemand are\n- Make-to-order (MTO): the company chooses\nto manufacture a product only after a request\nfrom a customer is received.\n- Make-to-stock (MTS): based on forecasts\nproduction is done in anticipation of future\ndemand.\n(c) Stephen C. Graves 2014\n\nTwo SC strategies - Examples\nMake-to-order (MTO)\nMake-to-stock (MTS)\n- Construction Industry\n- Vaccines and medicine\n- Customized products\n- Most consumer goods\n- Services/Food\n- Agricultural Products\nMore examples?\n(c) Stephen C. Graves 2014\n\nTwo SC strategies - Tradeoffs\nMTS\nMTO\nEconomies of Scale\n✔\nMore dependent on demand\nforecasts\n✔\nLonger lead time for customers\n✔\nEasier to scale-up\n✔\nCustomizable products\n✔\nForecasting is important for both models\n(c) Stephen C. Graves 2014\n\nTwo SC strategies - Emerging Markets\nIn the context of emerging markets, think about the\nfollowing question:\nCan you give examples of products for which a MTO model\n\"makes sense\" in a developed economy but not in an\nemerging economy?\n(c) Stephen C. Graves 2014\n\nMore reasons why forecasting is important\n- Forecast used for inventory planning at retail\nstore level and at DC level for products held in\nstock (ie, MTS)\n- Forecast used to determine when to order\nmore inventory\n- Need for simple, robust methods applicable\nfor wide range of contexts\n(c) Stephen C. Graves 2014\n\nForecast principles\nValue\nTime\nNow\n1. Forecasts are always wrong and should always\ninclude some measure of error\n2. The longer the horizon, the larger the error\n3. Method should be chosen based on need and\ncontext\n(c) Stephen C.

Graves 2014\n\nFactors for choosing forecast method\n- How is forecast to be used? Need for accuracy?\nUnits? Time period? Forecast horizon? Frequency of\nrevision?\n- Availability and accuracy of relevant data? censored?\n- Computational complexity? Data requirements?\n- How predictable is the entity? Are there independent\nfactors that affect it or are correlated to it?\n- Level of aggregation? Across geographies? Time?\nProduct categories?\n- Type of product? New or old?\n(c) Stephen C. Graves 2014\n\nTypes of forecasts\n- Qualitative; expert opinions\n- Diffusion models\n- Causal models, eg, regression\n- Disaggregation of an aggregate forecast\n- Aggregation of detailed forecasts\n- Time series methods\n(c) Stephen C.

But queue and wait often consume large amounts of time--in fact,\nthe majority of the elapsed total that the part spends inside the plant.\nFor parts that are going through bottlenecks, queue is the dominant\nportion.\nFor parts that are only going through non-bottlenecks, wait is dominant,\nbecause they are waiting in front of assembly for parts that are coming\nfrom the bottlenecks.\nSetupTime\nProcessTime\nQueue Time\nWait for Assembly Time\n\n\"Sacred Cows\" Slaughtered?\n\nMaximize worker efficiency\n\nMaximize equipment productivity\n\nOptimal batch size = EOQ\n\nRelease work to keep people busy\n\nAccounting rules represent Economic principles\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n15.772J / EC.733J D-Lab: Supply Chains\nFall 2014\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
