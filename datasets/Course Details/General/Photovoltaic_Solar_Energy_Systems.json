Does the \"Facing\nSouth\" mean anything in this case?)\n***\nYour task is to pick a city near your home town (or any city if your home town is not in the US) and compute\nmonthly values for the clearness index. Note that for any month there are many years worth of data so con\nstruct an average (of an average!) in estimating KT using at least some of the years and give some idea of the\n\"spread\" of the data.\nYou are encouraged to use a spread sheet but that's is not necessary.

The length of the day is defined by this rela\ntionship since, at sunrise and sunset, the zenith distance is 90o or π/2, i.e, the sun is at the horizon.\nSetting cos z = cos 90 = 0, this gives:\nωsunrise/sunset = ωss = arcos[-tan δ tan λ]\nThe remaining equations give the value of the azimuth angle, az as a function of the hour\nangle.\nBut the first equation for cos z gives us something more, namely, the instantaneous solar flux\nonto the horizontal plane. If we think of the sun's radiation, or solar insolation, as a fluid streaming\ntoward earth from the sun, then the flow through or across a plane area whose normal is oriented\nat some angle to the direction of the flow is proportional to the cosine of that angle.\nSolar Flux\nA\nz\nA cos z\ni\nAn alternate interpretation is to think of the flux onto the array as the flow normal to the area A\nwhich again is given by Acos z.\n\n-----\nNow the expression for cos z is of the form\ncos z = C1 + C2 cos ω\nwhich plots as a cosine shifted up or down depending upon the sign of C1 which depends, in turn,\non the sign of the declination. Note that C2 is always positive.\nFlux onto a tilted array.\nWe can do better than placing our solar array\nγ\nnormal, nc\nβ\ni\non the horizontal, at our latitude at any rate. To\nfind the flux on a tilted array we consider the orien\ntation of the array relative to our local coordinate\nframe:\ns\nto the sun\nIn this, β is the array tilt, and γ is, well lets just\ncall it γ. The unit normal to the tilted array can be\nj\nwritten:\nnc = (cos β) i + (sin β)(cos γ) j - (sing β)(sin γ) k\n-k\nIf the array is south facing, usually the case for a fixed array (no tracking), this simplifies to:\nnc = (cos β) i + (sin β)j\nNow the flux onto the array is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the unit vector to\nthe sun, s, and the unit normal to the array, nc. But this is given by the scalar product of these two\nvectors. This becomes, using all of the machinery presented above:\ncos(nc,s) = sin δ sin(λ-β) + cos δ cos (λ-β) cos ω\nWhich again, for prescribed declination, latitude and array inclination is a shifted cosine.\nMonthly average daily radiation and other awkward expressions:\nSay you are in outer space, in earth orbit, and your solar array is horizontal -- that is, lying on\nthe surface of the sphere whose radius is equal to the radius of your orbit. There is nothing\nbetween you and the sun, not even a wisp of aether to attenuate the solar radiation. The flux up\nthere, what we call the extra-terrestial flux is\nφext = 1.350 kw/m2\nOver the course of a day in space, the total solar radiation flux impinging upon your horizontal\narray will be given by\nωss\n\n2φext ∫ cos z ⋅ ------ dω ≡Hext\n2π\nWith cosz given as before, this integrates to:\nHext = π -φext cos δcos λ[sin ω\n- ω cos ω ]\nss\nss\nss\nPhotovoltaic Solar Energy Systems - The Solar Resource SP.769\n9/22/04\nLL Bucciarelli\n\nSay you are still outside the earth's atmosphere and\nyour solar array is tilted up an angle β to the horizontal,\nj\ns\nnormal, nc\nβ\nto the sun\nβ\ni\nbut is south facing i.e., γ =0.\nThen the cosine of the angle between a unit vector\nperpendicular to the array and a unit vector towards the\nsun is as above:\ncos(nc,s) = sin δ sin(λ-β) + cos δ cos (λ-β) cos ω\nwhich, again, is a function of the hour angle, or time of\nday.\nIntegrating this over the course of a day, from sunrise to sunset gives\nβ\n-----\nHext( ) = π -φext cos δcos (λ - β)[sin ω'\n- ω 'cos ω ']\nss\nss\nss\nwhere here we assume sun set on the panel before the horizontal. That is setting cos(nc,s) = cos\n90 = 0, gives:\n-\nω'\n= acos [-tan δ ⋅ tan (λ\nβ)]\nss\nSome Clearness Indexes\nThe \"clearness index\" KT, is a number derived from experience, from measured, total daily\nsolar insolation values for a particular location. It is defined as the ratio of monthly average, daily\ntotal horizontal insolation on the earth's surface H to the monthly average, daily total horizontal\ninsolation outside the atmosphere, in outer space, Hext.\nKT = H / Hext\nThe table shows values for clearness index at various locations.\nMonth\nBoston λ=42.1\nMadison λ=42.1\nAlbuquerque λ=35\nMiami λ=35\nJan\n0.41\n0.44\n0.64\n0.51\nFeb\n0.45\n0.49\n0.67\n0.54\nMar\n0.45\n0.50\n0.68\n0.56\nApr\n0.44\n0.47\n0.71\n0.57\nMay\n0.48\n0.51\n0.73\n0.53\nJune\n0.52\n0.53\n0.74\n0.48\nJuly\n0.53\n0.55\n0.70\n0.50\nAug\n0.49\n0.55\n0.70\n0.49\nSept\n0.49\n0.52\n0.71\n0.49\nOct\n0.47\n0.50\n0.71\n0.52\nNov\n0.42\n0.39\n0.67\n0.52\nDec\n0.42\n0.38\n0.63\n0.52\nThe Contribution of Diffuse Radiation at Tilt.\nWith the clearness index for a site, and our calculation of the extraterrestial radiation/energy\nimpinging onto the horizontal in space, we can estimate the monthly average, daily total solar inso\nlation on a horizontal array at the earth's surface at the site. The \"horizontal\" clearness index is a\nPhotovoltaic Solar Energy Systems - The Solar Resource SP.769\n9/22/04\nLL Bucciarelli\n\n-------\n-------\nnumber that is computed from the collection of field data at each site. As such it includes the\neffects of vagaries of the weather, diffuse and reflected, as well as direct, radiation on the total\ndaily flux onto the horizontal. If we set the array at a tilt angle up from the horizontal (the beta\nabove), we must take account of the diffuse (and reflected) radiation in another way. In other\nwords, we need to construct a site-specific Kt for the tilted surface.\nThe method we present relates the monthly-average daily total radiation incident on an\ninclined surface to the monthly-average daily radiation on a horizontal plane at the earth's surface\nby a factor R. The method is a first approximation. It was originally developed by Liu and Jordan1,\nevaluated by Klein3, then subsequently improved and refined by Klein and Theilacker4.\nWe\n\npresent the method in its first approximation form.\nHβ = R H\n⋅\nwhere\nHd\nHd\n\ncos\n+\nβ\nρ 1 - cos β\n⋅Rb + ------- ⋅ --------------------- + ⋅--------------------\nR = 1 -\n\nH\nH\nThe first of these states that the monthly-average, daily total radiation incident on a surface\ninclined at an angle β is given by the product of two factors: the monthly-average, daily total radia\ntion incident on a horizontal surface at the earth's surface and a coefficient R defined by the next\nequation. So far nothing ventured, nothing much gained.\nHd\nThe factor R is a bit more interesting. In this,\n\nis the ratio of the monthly-average,\n\nH\ndaily diffuse radiation to the monthly average, monthly-average, daily total radiation incident on a\nhorizontal surface - to be determined below - and Rb is the ratio of the monthly-average beam radi\nation on the tilted surface to that on a horizontal surface. The first ratio is constructed from experi\nmental field data, the second derives from our earlier geometric analysis. The parameter ρ is a\nmeasure of the site's surface reflectivity and is best obtained through measurement.\nBut first, consider the case when β, the tilt angle is zero, i.e., the surface is horizontal. In this\ncase, our expression for R comes to R = Rb which is as it should be. So what is going on here is,\nin the first term of R, we \"back out\" the contribution of the diffuse from the total incident on the hor\nizontal - so that the first term represents just the direct beam contribution to the horizontal -then\nadd it back in as a diffuse contribution in the second term.\nRb is then \"estimated\" to be the ratio of total, daily, direct extraterrestial radiation on the tilted\nsurface, what we labeled Hext(β), to that on a horizontal surface, Hext, so we have:\nβ\n-\nHext( ) cos δcos (λ\n\nβ)[sin ω'\n- ω 'cos ω ' ]\nss\nss\nss\nRb = ------------------- = ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHext\ncos δcos λ[sin ω\n- ω cos ω ]\nss\nss\nss\nIn this w'ss is the sunset hour on the tilted array while wss, without the prime, is the sunset hour on\nthe horizontal.\nWe still must reckon with the diffuse contribution. As noted, for this we rely upon exerimental\ndata.Two curve fits (at least) have been proposed. We show them both in graphical and algebraic\nform below:\n1.

      "content": "Present worth of tomorrow's benefits? Are they worth the (present) cost?\nThe question is of the sort one confronts when tempted to invest in a photovoltaic system, thinking that,\nwhile the initial investment may be large, one anticipates a steady annual return on that investment which\nwill more than justify the initial capital outlay. But how do we compare the accumulated benefit of the\nsteady annual returns with the initial cost of the system?1\nOne might be tempted to simply multiply the annual return on the investment by the number of years of sys\ntem life and compare that with the initial cost; but that won't do. For tomorrow's money is not worth as\nmuch as the same amount today. If you thought it was, I would ask you for a loan, say of $1000 which I\npromise to pay back over a period of 10 years (at $100 per year), then invest that $1000 in a bank that pays\nme interest, say 2%, a year. After the first year, I have (1+.02)*1000 = $1020. I deliver my annual $100 pay\nment to you, so I have $920 to invest the second year. The table summarizes the transactions over the life of\nthe loan:\nYear\nYour money\nMy money\nMy interest earned\nMy money plus\n$1000.00\n$20.00\n$1020.00\n$100.00\n920.00\n18.40\n938.40\n200.00\n838.40\n16.77\n855.17\n300.00\n755.17\n15.10\n770.27\n400.00\n670.27\n13.41\n683.68\n500.00\n583.68\n11.67\n595.35\n600.00\n495.35\n9.91\n505.26\n700.00\n405.26\n8.11\n413.36\n800.00\n313.36\n6.27\n319.63\n900.00\n219.63\n4.39\n224.02\n1000.00\n124.02\nSum = $124.02\nAfter 10 years, you can put your money back under your pillow. You haven't lost a cent. I, on the other hand,\nhave earned $124.02 dollars in interest. This may not strike you as any big deal but think: If I can find others\nlike you to lend me one thousand dollars under the same conditions I can live very well indeed. Say I find\n100 souls each year willing to do so2. The calculation of 10 years of interest income for this case is left to\nthe reader.\nNo, today's money in the bank shows not the same value next year, tomorrow. We all know that: Our money\nin a savings account \"earns\" interest, albeit not very much interest these days.3 Now consider the future\nworth of the money you deposit into a savings account. If you are a student, think of the future worth of the\nfuture money you deposit once you graduate after you have come up with some innovative scheme to make\nlots of money - perhaps over the internet.\nLet's say you are able to save today, in the present, an amount P = $1000.00 and the bank's interest rate is\nagain, r = 2% and you want to know what you will have after 20 years. Assume you never withdraw any\nfunds until the end of the 20 years. The calculation of the future value, S, of this deposit goes as follows:\n⋅(\nAt the end of one year, you will have\nS1 = P\n\n+ r) = 1000 ⋅(1.02 ) = 1020.00 dollars. At the end of the\n⋅(\n+\nsecond year S2 = (P\n\n+ r))(1\nr) = 1000 ⋅(1.02 )2 = 1040.40\n1. We leave aside the possibility that the initial cost will be spread out over more than an initial year. We also assume the\nannual benefit is constant over the life of the system.\n2. Not so improbable what with the internet and every one on line.\n3. We ignore inflation of the cost of goods and services we depend upon. If the rate of inflation exceeds the bank's interest\nrate, your money, though it appears to be increasing in amount will actually be worth less to you.\n11/10/04\nLL Bucciarelli\n\n----------------------------\n----------------------------\n------------\nInduction leads to the expression SN = P 1 + r)N for the future value after N years of our initial investment.\n(\nFor our particular numbers\nSN = 1000*(1.02)N = $1485.95\nSome people give the factor (1+r)N its own name i.e., F =(1+r)N . F is the \"compound amount factor\" in\nhonor of the fact that the bank effectively compounds your interest rate each year.\n***\nNow our photovoltaics investment question is of a different sort. We want to know if it is worth investing in\nphotovoltaics, building a system on our rooftop, today anticipating that we will save on electrical energy\nbills over the life of the system. Does that stream of benefits amount to more than the cost of the system?\nOne way, and a usual way, is to compute the present value of a future stream of benefits and compare that\nwith the present-day cost. But what is today's value of this stream of annual benefits which accumulate over\nthe life of the system - which we take as N=20 years?\nWe start by computing the future value, at the end of the life of the system, of this stream of annual benefits.\nThink of each year investing the benefit you receive, say b, at the end of each year in a savings account\nwhich gives an interest rate, again labeled r.\nAt the end of the first year, you deposit b dollars. You don't touch this until the end of 20 year life span of the\npv system. At that time, the b dollars has earned N-1 years of interest compounded at the rate r. Letting SN be\n-\nthe sum of this stream of annual benefits after N years, we have SN = b 1 + r)N\n. for the contribution to\n(\nthe future value of the stream of just the first year's benefit.\n-\n(\nN\n-\n(\n(\nAgain, induction leads to the expression\nSN = b 1 + r)N\n1 + b 1 + r)\n+ ...... + b 1 + r)0 where the last\nyears benefit gains no interest being that it arrives at the end of the 20th year.\nWe can find an expression for this sum, knowing that\n1+x + x2 + x3......+xN-1 = (1-xN)/(1-x) and identify\ning x with (1+r). Thus:\n(1\nr)N - 1\n+\nSN = b ⋅\nr\nNow to compute the present value, we ask what initial, one-time deposit into our savings account will yield\nthis future sum after N years? Our response is ready; we have already answered this sort of question. We\nhave\nSN\n(\nSN = P 1 + r)N\nso\nP = ------------------- so finally we have for the present value of our benefit stream\n+\n(1\nr)N\nb\nP = ------------------- ⋅\n(1\nr)N\n+\n(1\nr)N - 1\n+\nr\n= b ⋅ F\n-\nFr\nwhere we have introduced the compound amount factor, F, to give an apparent simplification.\n***\nNow consider an example using a \"discount rate\" - for that's what it is called - of 0.02, whether that is real\nistic or not. So r = .02 and F, then is F = (1+r)N = 1.486. Then with N = 20 years, we find that\nP = 16.4 b\nThis is significantly less that 20b, 20 years times the annual anticipated benefit. Note, however, that it is sig\nnificantly greater than the present value of 20b awarded you at the end of the life of the system. The present\nvalue of that lump sum award would be just\nP = 20b/F = 13.5b\n11/10/04\nLL Bucciarelli\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nEC.S07 Photovoltaic Solar Energy Systems\nFall 2004\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
