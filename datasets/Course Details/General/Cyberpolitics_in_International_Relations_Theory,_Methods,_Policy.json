Topics include legacies of the 20th-century creation of cyberspace, changes to the international system structure, and new modes of conflict and cooperation. Students will examine whether international relations theory accommodates cyberspace as a new venue of politics, and how cyberpolitics alters traditional international politics.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThis course is open to undergraduate and graduate students with permission from the instructors.\n\nRequirements\n\nStudents taking the graduate version are expected to pursue the subject in greater depth through reading and individual research.\n\nFor all students, the requirements include a choice of one of the following:\n\nResearch Paper--topic focus, abstract, and outline to be reviewed by the instructors in advance.\n\nThree short literature review & critique papers (due Week 6, Week 9 and Week 13).\n\nTake Home Final--(essays--openbook) one required question for all, and choice of two questions among several distributed on the last day of class and due on the following Friday.\n\nCalendar\n\nWEEK #\n\nTOPICS\n\nIntroduction--Cyberspace and International Relations\n\nEvolution of International Relations\n\nStructure, Process, and Levels of Analysis\n\nThe Construction of Cyberspace\n\nConcepts and Complexities\n\nIntegrating Cyberspace and International Relations\n\nGlobalization and Transformation\n\nContending Theories of International Relations\n\nExpansion of Cyber Access\n\nEvolving Parameters & Power Potentials\n\nCyber Conflicts and Threats to Security--Types & Cases\n\nCyber Cooperation and Modes of Collaboration--Types & Cases\n\nComparative Analysis and Cases in Context\n\nInternational Institutional Challenges Re-Visited--Sovereign\n\nStates, Private Order, ad hoc Arrangements\n\nGlobal Agenda--Emergent Accord & New Discord\n\nAlternative Futures--Vision, Principles, Trajectories",

The lower layers of the network\nshould implement basic and general functions,\nand the applications should be built \"above\"\nthese functions, at the edges.\n- E.g. move functions \"up and out\".\n- This causes function migration to the end-node.\n- The network should be \"as transparent as\ntechnology permits\".\n\nBenefits of end-to-end\nUser empowerment.\nRun what you please.\nFlexibility in the face of unknown applications.\nA network to hook computers together.\nLower cost in core of network.\nEliminate special \"features\".\nRely on edge-node equipment.\nMore robust applications.\nNo unexpected failures of third-party nodes.\nAn example of \"getting it wrong\": make the\nnetwork reliable.\n\nSummary\n- What \"the Internet\" does is very simple:\n- If forwards packets.\n- It is oblivious to the purpose of the packets.\n- Packets allow effective/efficient sharing.\n- Lots of applications run on the Internet\n- And there will be more tomorrow.\n- Each has its own design.\n- There is a tension/tradeoff as to where functions are\nplaced.\n- The Internet can exploit lots of technologies.\n\nHow about the phone system?\n- How does it different from the Internet?\n- And why?\n- What are the implications for policy?\n\nA simple view of the Internet\nUser\nUser\nUser\nUser\nUser\nUser\nUser\nUser\nRouter\nRouter\nRouter\nRouter\nRouter\nRouter\nRouter\nRouter\n\"The Internet\"\n\nA simple view of the phone system\nPhone\nPhone\nPhone\nPhone\nPhone\nPhone\nPhone\nSwitch\nSwitch\nSwitch\nSwitch\nSwitch\nSwitch\nSwitch\nSwitch\n\"The phone system\"\nPhone\n\nThe differences?\n- Switches are powerful, because phones\nare simple.\n- The knowledge of what the phone system is\nfor is embedded in the switches.\n- It \"knows\" that its purpose is to carry voice.\n- Routers are simple, because end-points\nare powerful.\n- The knowledge of what the Internet is for is\nembedded in the end-points.\n\nAnd...?\n- The phone system has no open API.\n- No easy way to attach new applications.\n- Compare the generality of a voice circuit and\npacket carriage.\n- Very different view of layering. There is no\n\"voice\" layer.\n\nMultiple views of system\n- Topology view:\n- Routers as expression of physical distribution.\n- Layered view:\n- What is the role of each \"box\".\n- What does this imply about limits to action?\n- Administrative view.\n- Who owns/operates each part?\n- Who controls what talks to what?\n\nA more realistic picture\nBackbone\n(big ISP)\nBackbone\n(big ISP)\nBackbone\n(big ISP)\nLittle\nISP\nUser\nUser\nUser\nUser\nLittle\nISP\nCorp\nCampus\nLittle\nISP\nUser\nUser\nUser\nUser\nUser\nUser\nUser\nThe ISP lives here..\nThe ISP does not live\nat the end-points.\n\nWhat is missing from all this?\nWhat is it for?\nHow is the Internet used?\nBriefly, lets talk about applications.\n\nApplication design\n- Applications run \"on\" the Internet. They are not\nthe Internet.\n- Many approaches to construction\n- Patterns of communication.\n- Use of end node software and server software.\n- Modern apps do not follow a simple end to end\nmodel.\n- (End to end at application level)\n- Remember the end to end argument?\n- They are full of servers and services run by third\nparties.\n\nSome examples:\nEmail:\nSender\nServer\nServer\nReceiver\nWeb:\nBrowser\nProxy\nServer\nSMTP\nSMTP\nPOP/ \nIMAP\nHTTP\n\nMore examples:\nNapster (early peer to peer)\nBitTorrent calls the catalog a tracker...\nPeer\nPeer\nPeer\nPeer\nData\nData\nData\nCatalog\n\nMore examples:\nLater peer to peer\nBitTorrent has a version that works without a tracker, \nusing a distributed data base to try to find the content.\nPeer\nPeer\nPeer\nPeer\nData\nData\nData\nJust go feel around\nfor the data. It might\nbe there\nsomewhere.\n\nMore examples:\nGames (some), and IM (some)\nClient\nClient\nClient\nClient\nServer\n\nThe changing structure...\n- In the old days, there were two sorts of\ndevices:\n- Routers\n- End-node computers.\n- Now:\n- Server farms\n- Cloud computing (latest buzzword...)\n- So where should computing be placed?\n- And why?\n\nWhat problems are we solving?\n- Ease of use\n- Ease of deployment\n- Performance\n- Economic (industry) structure\n- Robustness\n- Security\n- Who is in control?\n- Function placement based on trust.\n\nTrust relationships\nEmail:\nSender\nServer\nServer\nReceiver\nWeb:\nBrowser\nProxy\nServer\nSMTP\nSMTP\nPOP/ \nIMAP\nHTTP\n\nPlacement of computation\n- \"The Internet\" is not changed by where\ncomputation is placed.\n- Except that we need some really high-\ncapacity circuits...\n- But the user and the application is strongly\ninfluenced.\n\nI mentioned Comcast...\n- How did they disable BitTorrent?\n- They \"peeked\" at the data part of the\npacket\n- Called Deep Packet Inspection, or DPI.\n- When they saw a BitTorrent connection,\nthey inserted an extra message into the\nflow of packets (some might say \"forged\")\nthat said \"abort the connection\".\n\nWhat could the app do?\n- How could an application designer prevent this\nsort of intervention?\n- Encrypt the packets.\n- All anyone can see (unless they have the encryption\nkey) is the header.\n- Questions for later:\n- Should application designers and ISPs be in an arms\nrace?\n- Should the user view his ISP as an enemy?\n\nHost vs. router\nInternet\nApplications\nTechnologies\nTCP\nHost\nknows\nabout\nRouter\nknows\nabout\nNTWT*\n*Not the whole truth\n\nA (less) simple packet picture\nStuff...Destination/Source/Length...stuff\nA packet\nIP header\nLink Dest/Src/Length/NxtHdr SN/NxtHdr (app)\nTCP header\nHeader\nData\n\nImplications\nApplications are the reason to have an Internet\nin the first place.\nOnly geeks send packets for the fun of it.\nApplications are where the value is generated,\nand money is to be made.\nEcommerce, advertising, etc.\nApplications greatly broaden the set of\nstakeholders.\nPorn, music sharing, VoIP...\nRouters \"just\" forward packets.\nIs this the right view?\n\nA layered model of cyberspace\n- The previous discussion suggests that we\ncan describe the Internet (and cyberspace\nmore generally) using a layered model.\n- A layered model is a classic way of Computer\nScience thinking.\n- Several layered models have been posed,\nincluding the formal OSI reference model.\n- We will use a 4 layer model in our future\ndiscussions.\n\nA layered model of

And so on.\n\nA picture\nRoot\n.com\n.mit.edu\n.com IPaddr\n.edu IPaddr\n...\n.edu\n\nDesign goals\n- Resilience and failure-proof.\n- Replicated distributed servers at each level.\n- But not resistance to attack.\n- Penetration and corruption.\n- Mis-direction.\n- Lack of assurance as to authority.\n\n- Pharming, DHCP exploits\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n17.447 / 17.448 Cyberpolitics in International Relations: Theory, Methods, Policy\nFall 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
