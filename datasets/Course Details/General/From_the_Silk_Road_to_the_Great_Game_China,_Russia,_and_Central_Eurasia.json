They illustrate the evolution of this course over time, and are intended to provide alternate views into the instruction of this course.\n\nFall 2008, Ian Chapman (\nPDF\n)\n\nFall 2003, Peter Perdue (\nPDF\n)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis subject examines interactions across the Eurasian continent between Russians, Chinese, Mongolian nomads, and Turkic oasis dwellers during the last millennium and a half. As empires rose and fell, religions, trade, and war flowed back and forth continuously across this vast space. Today, the fall of the Soviet Union and China's reforms have opened up new opportunities for cultural interaction. Topics include the religious traditions of Central Asian Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, and Confucianism; caravans and travelers like Marco Polo and Rabban Sauma [the first Chinese to travel to the West]; nomadic conquest and imperialist competition, past and present. Source materials include primary documents, travelogues, films, and music.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nThis will be a lecture and discussion course. Come to class having done the reading for the week, and be prepared to discuss questions raised in the reading and lectures. There will be one hour exam at midterm, with a map quiz, ID questions, and a short essay.\n\nMuch of the information we have about this region comes from travelers' reports. These are both useful sources and fun to read. Each of you will have to read one, or part of one, traveler's account and give a short report on it in class. I will provide suggestions and bibliography later on.\n\nOne 10-15 page paper is due BEFORE the last class. This can be a discussion of a travel account, an art exhibit, political relations, or on a topic of your choice. I will give suggested topics and bibliography during the term.\n\nThere is NO Final Exam.\n\nReadings\n\nBarfield, Thomas.\nThe Perilous Frontier.\n\nBonavia, Judy.\nThe Silk Road.\n\nBrower, Daniel R., and Edward Lazzerini, eds.\nRussia's Orient: Imperial Borderlands and Peoples\n, 1700-1917.\n\nFoltz, Richard.\nReligions of the Silk Road\n.\n\nHopkirk, Peter.\nThe Great Game: The Struggle for Empire in Central Asia.\n\nKipling, Rudyard.\nKim.\n\nXinru, Liu.\nThe Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Interaction.\n\nPolo, Marco.\nThe Book of Marco Polo.\n\nRossabi, Morris.\nKhubilai Khan: His Life and Times.\n\nRudelson, Justin.\nOasis Identities.\n\nWhitfield, Susan.\nLife along the Silk Road.\n\nTitles of Student Papers\n\nNational Identities in Post Soviet Central Asia\n\nConrad's\nHeart of Darkness\nand Rudyard Kipling's\nKim\n\nMongolian Nationhood in Outer and Inner Mongolia\n\nThe Expeditions of Younghusband and Peter Fleming\n\nTibet and Communist China\n\nWarfare on the Steppe",
