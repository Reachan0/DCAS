      "content": "OLEDs:\nModifiability and Applications\nJill A. Rowehl\n3.063- Polymer Physics\n21 May 2007\n\n\"The dream is to get to the point where you can roll out\nOLEDs or stick them up like Post-it notes,\"\n--Janice Mahon, vice president of technical\ncommercialization at Universal Display1\nTake a look at your cell phone; do you see a display that saves your\nbattery and doubles as a mirror? When you dream of your next TV, are you\npicturing an unbelievably thin screen that can be seen perfectly from any viewing\nangle? If you buy a movie two decades from now, will it come in a cheap,\ndisposable box that continually plays the trailer? These three products are all\napplications of organic light emitting devices (OLEDs). OLEDs are amazing\ndevices that can be modified through even the smallest details of chemical\nstructure or processing and that have a variety of applications, most notably\nlighting and flexible displays.\nOverview of OLEDs: Structure and Operation\nThe OLED structure is similar to inorganic LEDs: an emitting layer\nbetween an anode and a cathode. Holes and electrons are injected from the\nanode and cathode; when the charge carriers annihilate in the middle organic\nlayer, a photon is emitted. However, there is sometimes difficulty in injecting\ncarriers into the organic layer from the usually inorganic contacts. To solve this\nproblem, often the structure includes an electron transport layer (ETL) and/or a\nhole transport layer (HTL), which facilitate the injection of charge carriers. All of\n\nthese layers must be grown on top of each other, with the first grown on a\nsubstrate (see Figure 1).\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see Fig. 2 in Remmers, Marcus, et al. \"The Optical, Electronic, and\nElectroluminescent Properties of Novel Poly(p-phenylene)-Related Polymers.\"\nMacromolecules 29 (1996): 7432-7445.\nFigure 1: Heterostructure of an OLED with both ETL and HTL2\nThere are many choices of materials for each layer, depending upon the\napplication. The substrate is usually glass but may also be made of\nPolyethylene for a flexible device3 or even a thin metal foil for a flexible yet\nprotective and durable layer4. The anode is usually transparent ITO but may be\n--for example--porous polyaniline5, and the cathode is often calcium or another\nlow work function metal6. The anode, of course, must be transparent so that the\nemitted photons can exit the device. Example materials of ETL and HTL are\nAlq3 and TPD7, respectively. The emitting layer is discussed in depth below.\nThere is great potential for this entire device to be easily processed, giving\nindustry researchers a great reason to take a hard look at OLEDs.\nThe principles behind the emittance of photons can be fairly complicated,\nhowever even a simple knowledge of the physics behind OLEDs is enough to\nunderstand their potential. At a basic level of understanding: a hole is injected\ninto one layer of the device and an electron is injected into the other side of the\ndevice. The two charge carriers move along the polymer chains in the emitting\nlayer, and when these two charge carriers combine, they emit a photon (they\nproduce light). There are many factors that determine the wavelength of the\n\nreleased photon: bonding energy of the polymers, conjugation length, etc. It is\ndependent on the specific material properties. A sketch of the energy bands for\na tri-layer device is shown in Figure 2; an ETL or HTL would simply add another\nlayer to the sketch.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see Fig. 1 in Nuyken, Oskar, et al. \"Modern Trends in Organic Light-Emitting Devices\n(OLEDs).\" Monatshefte fur Chemie 137 (2006): 811-824.\nFigure 2: Energy bands of a monolayer PLED8\nModifying the Emitted Wavelength\nFor the emitting layer, there are multiple choices of materials and of\nprocessing variables such that an emission of a very wide range of wavelengths\nis possible. Two commonly used polymers for the emitting layer are poly\n(paraphenylene), PPP and poly(p-phenylenevinylene), PPV (see Figure 3),\nwhich normally emit green and blue light, respectively9. However, sometimes it\nmay be to our advantage to tailor the wavelength of an OLED while using the\nsame emitting polymer. Modifications are possible since the band gap energy of\nthe emitting layer can be radically changed by varying the morphology of the\npolymer thin film10 . This transformation can be performed in multiple ways:\nchanging the chemical structure, by changing the length of uninterrupted\nconjugation (possibly by forming a copolymer), by changing the concentration of\nthe polymer solution during fabrication, or by changing the spin rate when using\nthe spin-coating technique.\n\na\nb\nFigure 3: (a) Poly(paraphenylene) (PPP)11, and (b) An example of a Poly(p\nphenylenevinylene) (PPV) based copolymer, containing rigid (A) and flexible (B)\nblocks12\nModification of the Chemical Structure\nOne of the factors determining the band gap energy of the emitting layer\nis the planarity of the polymer. One way to adjust the planarity is to change the\nR groups attached to the phenyl group on the backbone of the polymer. Even\nthough the equilibrium position is trans (R-groups opposite of each other), the\nangle of the R-group (and thus the phenyl group in the backbone) must change if\nthe R-group is too large and there is stereo-hindrance. This change in planarity\ncauses a change in the energy band gap--the determining factor for the\nwavelength of the emitted photon9.\nAnother factor determining the band gap energy is the length of\nconjugated segments in the polymer. The length of conjugated segments is the\nlength along the backbone of connected, resonating π* electron orbitals. If this\nlength is shorter than the conjugation length of the polymer (a material constant),\nthen the chain will have a higher energy band gap13 and thus a photon of shorter\nwavelength will be emitted when the electron recombines with a hole. The\n\nlength of conjugated segments can either be the molecular weight of a straight\npolymer or the length of uninterrupted conjugation in a copolymer. For PPP-like\npolymers, the conjugation length is approximately 10-15 phenyl groups14 . Thus,\nif the molecule length is greater than 15 phenyl groups, then the emitted photon\nwill have the same wavelength for any fluctuation in molecular weight. However,\nif the polymer length is less than 10 phenyl groups, the wavelength of the\nemitted photon will vary dependent on the length of the polymer backbone. The\nsame length dependence has been found in copolymers, where the determining\nlength is the length of the emitting polymer segment (usually the stiff block).\nYang et al.15 demonstrated that shortening the length of the uninterrupted\nconjugated segment would cause the OLED to emit blue light rather than green\nlight. Thus, co-polymerization is a potential process with which to alter the\nemitted wavelength of an OLED.\nModification of Processing\nNot only does the chemical structure of the emitting material affect its\nemission, but the processing of the emitting layer has a strong effect on the\nemission spectrum as well. The processing can radically change the\nmorphology of the polymer, which powerfully influences the electroluminescence.\nThere are multiple potential fabrication methods for organic thin films,\nhowever spin-coating is the most common. In spin-coating, a solution of polymer\nis placed on the previously grown layer and the device is rotated by a spinner.\nThe centripetal force causes the solution to spread over the below layer, creating\na thin film. After spinning, the device is annealed such that any liquid solvent\n\nthat was still left in the polymer solution evaporates, leaving only the polymer in\nthe emitting layer.\nSpin-coating is the preferred fabrication technique for polymer thin films\nsince it does not require very high temperatures and creates films of the\nnecessary range of thickness. Polymers often decompose when heated, thus\nthermal vacuum evaporation is often not an option for growth. Also, spin-coating\ncan produce very thin films, such as those needed for OLEDs. The procedure\ncan't be used to create thicker films (greater than thousands of Angstroms), but\nrarely are such thick films used in OLEDs. A disadvantage of the spin-coating\ntechnique is the inability of pattering. Spin-coating creates a large plane of only\none emitting polymer. Pixels can be created by patterning the cathode, however\nall pixels will be the same color16 . Nevertheless, spin-coating is commonly used\nin the research field, and thus the processing variables discussed here apply\nmostly to this technique.\nA simple method of changing the emission spectrum is to dissolve the\npolymer at different concentrations and/or into different solvents. Once the\nconcentration of the polymer in solution is greater than the overlap concentration\n(c*), the polymer chains will begin to interact and aggregate. It is around this\naggregation limit that the emission spectrum transforms. Liu et al17\ndemonstrated that the emission spectra transformed as they changed\nconcentration of poly(2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethyl-hexyloxy)- 1,4-phenylene vinylene)\n(MEH-PPV) dissolved in poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PF) in solid-state. MEH-PPV\nat a concentration of 4% gave a very different spectrum than pure MEH-PPV,\nwith λmax at 4% MEH-PPV concentration approximately 100 nm less than λmax at\n\n100% (see Figure 4). This dramatic transformation can be attributed to the lack\nof interchain interactions (which give rise to the emission at approximately\n650nm) in the dilute concentration18 . Thus, the emitted color of an OLED can\ndiffer solely on the concentration of the emitting polymer within solid solution.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see Fig. 1 in Liu, Jie, et al. \"Improving the performance of polymer light-emitting\ndiodes using polymer solid solutions.\" Applied Physics Letters 79 (July 30, 2001): 578\n580.\nFigure 4: Dependence of emission spectrum on concentration of MEH-PPV\nmixed with PF in solid-state17.\nThe emission of a pure polymer thin film in the OLED can also be affected\nby the differences in morphology due to variation in spin-coating technique. For\nexample, changing the concentration of the emitting polymer in solution (even\nwhen the solute entirely evaporates) can shift the emission spectrum. If the\nconcentration of the polymer is below c*, then there are no (or very few)\nentanglements to prevent the elongation of the chains when spin-coated onto the\ndevice. The elongation of the chains increases the planarity of the carbon\nbackbone, and thus increases the energy of an emitted photon. If the\nconcentration of polymer is above c*, then the polymers will be overlapping and\naggregated. When the solution is then spin-coated, the entangled polymers do\nnot stretch radially to the extent of those below c*, and therefore the energy of an\nemitted photon from this system is slightly decreased19 .\nSimilarly, the spin rate can shift the emission spectrum of the polymer. As\nthe spin rate increases, the centripetal force increases and causes greater radial\nextension of the chains. Again, this extension affects the planarity of the\n\npolymers, increasing their conjugation and thus decreasing the energy of\nemission. Changing the spin rate from 2000 rpm to 8000 rpm of MEH-PPV films\ngives a λmax change of approximately 10 nm20, and changing the concentration of\npolymer from 0.3% to 1% also shifts λmax by approximately 10 nm19.\nThere are many ways to modify the emission spectrum of OLEDs to\ncustom tailor the device to a specific application. There are also many\napplications for OLEDs which determine the socioeconomic effect of the above-\nmentioned research. Two of the most important applications are discussed\nbelow: residential lighting and televisions.\nApplication 1: Residential Lighting\nOne of the major applications for OLEDs is lighting, especially residential.\nThe US Department of Energy reports that lighting consumes approximately 20%\nof the nation's energy, and residential lighting consumes about a quarter of that.\nFor this reason, the DOE has formulated the Solid-State Lighting program with\nthe goal of developing commercially acceptable lights that will use only half the\nenergy used currently for residential lighting. Many of these lights will be OLEDs\nand will be mostly large displays. Figure 5 shows a prototype room lit with\nOLEDs (on a small scale).\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see http://tinyurl.com/yu3pb3\nFigure 5: Prototype of a room lit with OLEDs21\n\nAs part of their Solid-State Lighting program, the DOE recently recognized\na lab group shared between University of Southern California (USC) and\nUniversal Display Corporation (UDC) for their substantial impact on the research\nof OLEDs. This group \"was able to obtain an efficacy of 30 lumens per watt\n(lm/W), twice that of an incandescent bulb, at 70 CRI and this new record\n[external quantum efficiency].\" A representative of the DOE stated: \"The\nDepartment will continue to work with Universal Display and other lighting\nresearch partners to drive further technology advances and efficiency\nbreakthroughs that will make solid-state lighting a cost-effective, energy-saving\nalternative for general lighting applications.\"22 Obviously, the US government\norganization knows that OLEDs can do an amazing amount of good for our\ncountry: save space, money, and energy in the most common context. That is\nwhy government and industry alike continually research and support research on\nOLEDs and strive to create OLEDs that will transform the world. The UDC press\nrelease explained, \"this achievement represents another important step toward\nDOE's long-term SSL research goal of 160 lm/W in a cost-effective, market-\nready white lighting OLED product.\"23\nThis goal gives us insight into another great benefit of OLEDs: they will be\nmuch more efficient than the presently common in candescent bulbs. Thus, if\nOLEDs become prevalent, we will consume less energy, which is wonderful for\nnumerous reasons (delaying global warming, conservation of fossil fuels,\ndecreasing the trade imbalance, etc.). Ultimately, OLEDs are great for our\neconomy and environment.\n\nApplication 2: OLED TVs\nBy the end of this year, OLED televisions will be sold commercially. There\nare a large number of advantages to OLED TVs, yet there are also many\nhindrances to their commercialization. OLED TVs are amazingly beautiful\nscreens: they produce vivid color at nearly any viewing angle. As one forum\nmember described, \"LCD and plasma displays look faded in comparison.\"24\nHowever, the commercialization of OLED TVs has been delayed due to an\nimmense need for more research in the field. Some examples of hindrances are\nthe low lifetimes of the OLED pixels25, the variability in manufacturing\nprocesses26, and legal delays due to Kodak's patent on some of the basic\ntechnology27 .\nOne year ago, Samsung displayed a forty-inch television screen\n(http://tinyurl.com/2hpqle); however, there are not yet plans for commercial\nsale.28 This January Sony unveiled their own OLED screens (Figure 7), and in\nMay announced its plans to commercially distribute the smaller version of the\nOLED TVs by the end of this year24.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see http://tinyurl.com/2hpqle\nFigure 6: Samsung displays its 40'' OLED TV (May 2005) 28\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see http://tinyurl.com/2yxtre\nFigure 7: Sony displays its OLED TVs (Jan 2007)29\nThere is obviously progress being made in the field of OLED TVs,\nhowever there are competitors for display technology. Some notable mentions\n\nare plasma, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and even field emission displays\n(FEDs)30, as well as inorganic LEDs. LCDs already have a very strong hold on\nthe television market, so OLEDs would be best sold in a niche market. An\nexample of this would be flexible OLEDs (FOLEDs)3. Since the emitting\npolymers or small organic molecules are flexible, the display itself can be flexible\nas long as it is deposited on a flexible substrate. In February 2006, UDC has\nintroduced a rollable OLED with full-color and full-action31, with a metal foil\nsubstrate and a multilayer thin film as encapsulation. FOLED applications can\nbe anything from rollable TV screens to product wrappers to clothing. Surely\nthey will soon be seen everywhere.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see http://www.universaldisplay.com/video/2002foled257.wmv\nFigure 8: Flexible OLED by UDC32\nConclusion\nThere are many advantages to using OLEDs in multiple applications.\nMost importantly, the color of the emitted light can be changed by a few\nmodifications to morphology of the polymer. Since OLEDs can be very beneficial\nto our society both economically and environmentally, there is no doubt that their\npresence in the market will continue to increase.\n\nCNET News. \"Tripping the Lights Organic.\" 5 Sept 2006.\nhttp://news.com.com/Tripping+the+lights+organic/2100-1008_3-6111872.html\nRemmers, Marcus et al.

      "content": "POLYMER FOAMS\n3.063 Polymer Physics\nSpring 2007\nKatrine Sivertsen\n\nIntroduction\nIt is hard to go a day without coming across some sort of polymer foam. Polymer\nfoams are found virtually everywhere in our modern world and are used in a wide variety of\napplications such as disposable packaging of fast-food, the cushioning of your furniture and insulation\nmaterial.\nPolymer foams are made up of a solid and gas phase mixed together to form a foam.\nThis generally happens by combining the two phases too fast for the system to respond in a smooth\nfashion. The resulting foam has a polymer matrix with either air bubbles or air tunnels incorporated in\nit, which is known as either closed-cell or open-cell structure. Closed-cell foams are generally more\nrigid, while open-cell foams are usually flexible.\nThe gas that is used in the foam is termed a blowing agent, and can be either chemical\nor physical. Chemical blowing agents are chemicals that take part in a reaction or decompose, giving\noff chemicals in the process. Physical blowing agents are gases that do not react chemically in the\nfoaming process and are therefore inert to the polymer forming the matrix.\nPolymer foams are produced in a number of different ways. Examples are through\nslab-stock by pouring, extrusion and different forms of molding.\nPolymer foams can be divided into either thermoplastics or thermosets, which are\nfurther divided into rigid or flexible foams. The thermoplastics can usually be broken down and\nrecycled, while thermosets are harder to recycle because they are usually heavily crosslinked.\nIssues facing the polymer foam industry is that of waste disposal, recyclability,\nflammability and the effect of blowing agents on the environment. The restrictions on the use of\nCFC's (chloro-fluoro-carbons) has become very important in making polymer foams more\nenvironmentally friendly. Advances in biodegradable foam materials are also helping to improve the\nrecyclability and waste disposal.\n\nThe reason polymer foams are so widely used is that they have a lot of advantageous\nproperties. The density is low, and so the weight reduction compared to other options is significant.\nSome polymer foams have very low heat transfer, making them optimal insulators. Many are flexible\nand soft, meaning they provide more comfort when used for furniture and bedding.\nThrough this paper I will examine these topics, and specifically focus on polyurethane\nfoam as one of the most common polymer foams used in everyday life and applications.\nBrief history\nPolymer foams were first made in the 1930's and -40's, with foamed polystyrene being\nthe first polymer foam in 1931. Polyurethane was invented by Dr. Otto Bayer at the start of the\nsecond World War. It was first used as a replacement for rubber and also used as a coating to protect\nother common materials at the time such as metals and wood.\nA few years after the war, the flexible polyurethane foam was invented and it was first\nthen that it started being used for cushioning in furniture and automotive industry.\nThe two decades following made polymer foams more widely used as new\ntechnologies developed, introducing methods such as injection molding, twin screw for foam and\nseveral extrusion techniques.\nThe use of blowing agents that contributed to the ozone layer depletion raised concerns\nin later years and has lead to a focus on finding blowing agents that will not have a negative\nenvironmental impact.\nTypes of polymer foam\nPolyurethane\nPolyurethanes are any type of polymer containing a urethane linkage. The urethane\nlinkage is -NH-CO-O-. The way to form polyurethanes is done by reacting isocyanates with\ncompounds that have an active hydrogen, such as diols, that contain hydroxyl-groups, in the presence\nof a catalyst. Since there are many compounds containing active hydrogens and many different\n\ndiisocyanates, the number of polyurethanes that can be synthesized is also large. The specific\nproperties of the polyurethane can be tailored to a specific need by combining the appropriate\ncompounds.\nPolyurethanes can exist as both rigid and flexible foams, and as a coating or adhesive\nmaterial. Since polyurethanes come in so many forms and can have a wide variety of properties, it is\nalso used in many different applications. Rigid polyurethanes are used as insulation and flotation,\nwhile flexible ones are used for cushioning and packaging. In addition, they are used as adhesives in\nconstruction and transportation. Rhinoskin is an example of a polyurethane used for coating and\nprotection. It is sprayed onto a surface and then sets to protect the underlying layer.\nPolyurethanes are mostly thermosets, which means they are hard to melt and reprocess\nand can therefore have the disadvantage of being non-recyclable.\nBiodegradable foams\nBiodegradable polymer foams are investigated not only because of the increasing\nwaste and environmental problems for traditional polymer foams, but also because of the increasing\nprice of petroleum products that are used in manufacturing the polymer foams.\nBiodegradable foams are water soluble and sensitive to humidity, while traditional\npetroleum-based foams are more inert to water. Biodegradable foams are also limited in making\nfoams that have microcellular structure, which means they will be hard to make into thin sheets.\nHowever, they are important in reducing the amount of CO2 emission. There is also a\nwide range of different candidates of biomaterials that can be used for biodegradable foams, including\nethylene vinyl alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol, polycaprolactone, polylactic acid and starch.\nStarch\nStarch foam was made already in 1989 as biodegradable packaging, and is an\nalternative material to the traditional polystyrene foams. Starch is a polysaccharide made up of\nglucose units linked by glycoside linkages, and its length is generally between 500-2000 repeat units.\n\nStarch is made up of amylose and amylopectin Amylose is more linear and gives the foam flexibility\nand keeps the density low, while amylopectin is highly branced and makes the product more\nfoamable. Starch can be extracted from for example corn or potatoes.\nStarch foams are produced by extrusion where the starch is melted and mixed with a\nblowing agent. The blowing agent for starch is often water or methanol, which is turned into steam\nwhen the system is heated and forms air bubbles within the starch matrix. The extrusion process is a\ncontinuous, low-cost method that is easy to use. It is still hard to make the foam smooth and have a\nhigh number of closed cells. The use of thermoplastic polymer additives can help even out the\nsurfaces, but can also decrease the degradability of the foam by incorporating slowly degrading or\nnon-degradable polymers.\nSynthesis\nPolyurethane\nAs mentioned earlier polyurethanes are made by the addition reaction of\npolyisocyanates and polyols. When there are two functional groups it's termed a diisocyanate and diol\nas seen below.\nhttp://www.pslc.ws/mactest/uresyn.htm\nFigure 1: Reactants used for polyurethane\nAlong with a nucleophile like diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), the mixing of\nthese two monomers will form a dimer, which again will continue to react with other monomers,\n\ndimers and oligomers and form long polyurethane chains.\nThe positive charge due to oxygen's electronegativityon the hydrogen at the end of the\ndiol attracts the nucleophile, which wants to bind to a nucleus (nucleophile=nucleus loving). The\noxygen then becomes more negative and reacts with a carbon on an isocyanate group. This leaves the\nnitrogen on the isocyanate group to be negative, which is highly unfavorable. The nitrogen will give\noff its negative charge to the hydrogen atom on the alcohol group, finally forming a urethane bond\nbetween the two monomer units, resulting in a urethane dimer. The dimer will have one end group\nthat is isocyanate, while the other is an alcohol group. Each end can now react with other monomers\nand oligomers until polyurethane is formed. This is called a step-growth reaction. Step-growth\nreactions are characterized by longer chains being able to react and add to a growing chain just like\nmonomers can, unlike chain-growth polymerization where only monomers can add to the growing\nchain. It is also an addition reaction since no small compounds are given off during the reaction.\nhttp://www.pslc.ws/mactest/uresyn.htm\nFigure 2: the DABCO attaches to the hydrogen of the alcohol group. The negative oxygen then reacts\nwith the carbon on the isocyanate group, leading to a negative nitrogen. The nitrogen gives off its charge to the\n\nhydrogen and the two monomers become bound together to a dimer by a urethane linkage.\nIf instead of a diol, a macrodiol is used in the reaction, the polyurethane gets\nalternating soft and rigid segments, where the macrodiol makes up the soft segments in between the\nrigid blocks from the diisocyanate monomers.\nThe difference between making polyurethane and polyurethane foam is that a gas has\nto be incorporated in the final product. To achieve this the isocyanate group is reacted with water\nforming an amine and CO2 gas. Because the isocyanate group turns into an amine, the reaction with\nother diisocyanates will result in some urea-linkages in the polyurethane foam, but this doesn't affect\nthe properties of the polymer foam much, and is necessary to get the gas to be produced and expand\nthe polymer into a foam.\nhttp://www.pslc.ws/mactest/foamsyn.htm\nFigure 3. The reaction of water with isocyanate group forms and amine group and expels carbon\ndioxide gas.\nBlowing agents\nAs seen in the last paragraph, water was used as a blowing agent to produce CO2.\nBecause the water needed to be part of a reaction, it's a chemical blowing agent. Physical blowing\nagents don't take part in a chemical reaction, but are volatile liquids that evaporate and make the foam\nexpand. First generation physical blowing agents are mostly outruled because of their negative\n\nenvironmental impact on the ozone layer. This is especially the case for chlorofluorocarbons.\nCFC's and HCFC's\nCFC's are ideal blowing agents besides the tremendous environmental concerns\nassociated with them. They are not flammable, have fitting boiling points and are non-toxic. They\nalso have good thermal insulation properties.This is why it has been hard to find a replacement for\nthese blowing agent that has equivalent properties.\nHydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) are blowing agents\nwith a lot smaller impact on the ozone layer and with similar properties. HCFC's are being phased out\nsince they still have ozone depletion problems. Although HFC's have no impact on the ozone\ndepletion, it has high global warming potential. However, they have a lower shelf life and can\nsometimes be flammable, which creates concern because this decreases the safety of polyurethane\nfoams.\nCO2\nLiquid CO2 is used as a blowing agent because it does not have the same\nenvironmental issues as CFC's and HCFC's. It has a low global warming potential and is inexpensive.\nIt is also easier to obtain low density foams using CO2.\nManufacturing methods\nSlabstock\nSlabstock processing has its name from the way that the foam is cut into large slabs\nafter being processed, instead of formed into specific geometric shapes. The materials are spread onto\na conveyor through a mixing head, and the foam forms on the conveyor constrained by walls so the\nfoam forms a large slab of material. The foam is then cut into suitable size slabs.\n\nhttp://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-12032002-170009/unrestricted/02_Chapter_1.pdf\nFigure 4: The foam is mixed and poured onto a conveyor and forms one large continuous piece that is\ncut into slabs.\nMolding\nMolding processes can be divided into either cold-molded or hot-molded processes,\ndiffering by their molding temperatures. The process injects foam into separate formed molds and\nshapes the foams into individual pieces with the same shapes. This process is more complicated than\nslabstock and more costly.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see Harrington, R. and Hock, K. Flexible Polyurethane Foams, 2nd ed.

The mixing head inserts an equal and discrete amounts of\nmaterial into each mold. The molds are made to form the foam into specific geometries.\n\nProperties of polymer foams\nStructure\nAs mentioned earlier foams can be dividedinto open-cell and closed-cell structures.\nHowever, the term cell in this context is somewhat different than what it is usually considered as. In\nall foams the cell or pore structure is not a specific uniform unit, there is instead a wide range of\ndifferent sized cells and pores and a certain amount that are closed-cell and open-cell although one\nwill be the dominating structure.\nFigure 6: A model of a closed-cell structure where all the pores are constrained by polymer matrix\nwalls.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see http://ciks.cbt.nist.gov/%7Egarbocz/closedcell/img54.gif\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see http://irc.web-t.cisti.nrc.ca/cbd/figures/166f03.gif\nFigure 7: Open cell structure of polyurethane foam at 20x magnification. The pores are not enclosed\nbut form a continous network.\n\nSince the size and shape of the cells or pores are very disperse the best approach to\ndescribe foam structures is through statistical models, since there is never a regular packing of\nspherical cells in a foam. The models used range from cells being modeled as spheres, polygons and\ndodecahedrons.In addition the cells are usually elongated in a certain direction as the polymer is\nfoamed, making it harder to model the foam as any ideal model. It is not only the polymer itself that\ncontributes to the properties of the foam, but the gas-filled space between them. In comparison to\nother non-polymeric foams where the voids or gas-filled spaces do not interact with the surrounding\nmatrix, in polymer foams the intercellular gas interacts with the matrix and affects its properties and\nbehaviors and can change them over time.\nThe parameter G is the relative geometrical volume and φg is the volume fraction of\ncells/pores which the gas occupies. The total volume is the sum of the volume fraction of the gas,\npolymer and moisture, since the foam always sucks up some moisture from the environment.\nG is the quotient of the total number of voids over the net volume.\nG= Vg/Vo\nThe gas-filling factor is a similar parameter that is often more convenient. It is the\nquotient of the total number of voids over the solid phase volume.\nG= Vg/Vs\nThe volume fraction of cells/pores is\nφg= (ρp-ρ)/ρp\nwhich is the difference between the density of the unexpanded polymer and the\napparent density of the foamed polymer over the unexpanded polymer density. This formula neglects\nthe weight of the gas in the pores.\nThis can also be written in terms of the mass and density of the gas:\n\nφg= (mg)/ (Vo ρg)\nThe amount of pores in the foam structure affects many of its properties. When there\nare more and smaller pores the foam is a much better insulator, because the gas basically cannot\ntransfer heat and the heat convection has to find its way around all the pores. The more pores there\nare the more tortuous the path, and there is less chance of the heat transfer happening effectively. In\nthis case, the gas phase is more dominant in determining the foam properties than the actual polymer.\nThe mechanical response of the foam is also dictated by the structure. In an open-cell\nstructure the gas phase is not held together and the foam can compress much more. The foam will\nreform by sucking up air again, but will not be able to mimic its original shape exactly and the\nstrength and energy absorption of the system will be weaker.\nThe size of the cell also affects the properties of the foam. Foams with smaller cells\nare better at energy absorption. At smaller cell sizes the amount of open-cell structure also decreases.\nMechanical\nSince gas has the least mechanical strength, the more gas there is the less strong the\nfoam will be, which means the lower density foams exhibit the smallest Young's modulus. Even if the\ncells of the foam have varying shape, there is usually some anisotropy to the foam because of the\ndirection it is being formed at. The strength is better along the direction of foaming. If the ratio of\nheight to width of a cell is increased by a certain amount, the compressive strength and the tensile\nstrength of the foam also increases by the same amount. So the geometry of the cells could have\nmore to say for the strength than density, chemistry and the amount of open-cells in the structure.\nOpen-cell structures have the disadvantage of lower mechanical properties, but is\nmuch better at sound absorption. Because the open-cell structure affects the modulus of the foam, this\nmust be taken into account when calculating the modulus.\nThe modulus is:\nMf/Mp = (1-x)φ2 (ρf/ ρp )+x (1-φ)(ρf//ρp)\n\nwhere Mf is the modulus of the foam and Mp is the modulus of the polymer. Φ is the\nvlume fraction and ρ is the density, with the subscripts f and p for foam and polymer. X is the closed-\ncell fraction.\nImpact absorption is a key advantage of polymer foams over the unfoamed polymer.\nThe cells deform to absorb the energy impact and then reform when the load is removed. The\npolymer foam has to be able to resist multiple loadings, and resisting change to the structure so the\nloading can be repeated many times. If the foam is exposed to loads that are too large the cell walls\nwill rupture and the amount of open-cell structure will increase and weaken the mechanical properties\nof the foam.\nThermal conductivity\nThe total thermal conductivity is the sum of the conductivities of both the gas and solid\nphase plus the thermal conductitvity due to convection and radiation. The thermal conductivity is very\nlow for polymer foams because the amount of solid in the foam is very small ( on the order of 3%\n10% of the total volume). The fraction of solid used is not always minized though, because of a\ndecrease in mechanical strength of the foam or because it is harder to produce low density foams for\nsome raw materials.\nThe gas phase contributes the most to heat transfer. The thermal conductivity of a gas\ndecreases with an increase in molecular weight, so a heavy gas is more desirable as a blowing agent,\nalthough this is not always possible either because of cost or convenience. After usage and time the\ngas phase in the foam is replaced by air which has just a slightly higher thermal conductivity than\nsome heavier blowing agents like CFC's and CO2. The larger molecular weight compounds also\ndiffuse much slower through the polymer matrix, and the replacement of air into the foam goes much\nslower, keeping the thermal conductivity as low as possible.\nRadiative heat transfer happens through cell walls, so a foam with many small cells\nwill transfer less heat than a foam with a small amount of large cells. The cell size has a larger impact\n\nthan just changing the density.\nConvective heat transfer only takes place in foams with very large cell sizes and is for\nthe most part negligible.\nThe thermal conductivity has a minimum at a certain density. At low densities the\nradiative component is more dominant since the cell size is larger, and so is the convective\ncomponent. At high densities the number of cell walls and the thickness of them is higher so the\nradiative component is less important, but the heat transfer through the solid phase becomes more\ndominant.\nFigure 8: The lowest curve shows how low thermal conductvity foam has compared to other\ninsulating materials and that it has a minimum at a certain density value.\nFlammability\nThe volatile liquids that are often used as blowing agents in foams and lead to easily\ncombustible foams. The flexible polyurethane foams are low density and have a lot of open-cell\nstructure, which means it is permeable to air. This means that it will easily burn when exposed to a\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/jbsmse/v28n1/28260f1.gif\n\nflame. This is a concern that the industry has to deal with in increasing the safety of their products.\nOne of the solutions is to use flame retardants in the foam. Chlorinated phosphate esters, chlorinated\nparaffins, melamine powders and graphite are common as flame retardants.\nApplications\nPolyurethane foam\nRigid\nRigid polyurethane foams are mostly used in thermal insulation applications such as\nrefrigerators, freezeres, insulated buildings, insulated trucks carrying produce, water heaters,\nthermoses etc. Hence, rigid polyurethanes contribute a lot to energy saving appliances.\nPolyurethane foams with a high closed-cell structure are moisture resistant and\ncan be used as buoyancy in boats. The advantage is that the foam will not deflate upon a puncture, but\nretains its buoyancy even after many load-unload cycles.\nFlexible\nMost of the flexible polyurethane foam produced is made for cushioning. This\nincludes furniture, packaging and transportation. Furnishings use polyurethane foam for carpet\nunderlay, bedding, home furniture. The transportation industry uses it in seating cushions for the\nairlines, trains and bicycles and cars. It is also used in a wide range of other applications for cars such\nas sound insulation and vibration dampening. Other applications include clothing, toys, electronics\nand other applications for protection or cushioning issues.\nPolystyrene foam\nPolystyrene foam's most known application is the white polystyrene cups which are\nideal for hot beverages because of the foam's good thermal insulation properties. Polystyrene foam is\nalso used for packaging purposes, mostly food containers and disposable dishes and egg cartons.\nHigh-impact polystyrene can also be used in structural appliances instead of rigid\n\nmaterials like wood and metal.\nFigure 9: Examples of polystyrene applications\nConclusion\nThe structure is divided into open-cell or closed-cell foams, but most have a small\namount of the other as well. Production of the foams can happen in many different ways, slabstock\nand molding were two that were mentioned here. Since polymer foams are used widely all over the\nglobe the technology to produce foams is continuously being improved.\nAlthough many blowing agents are good in that it produces a satisfying product, the\nenvironmental impacts can be large, so blowing agents such as CFC's and HCFC's are not in use\nanymore. CO2 and other less environmentally dangerous substances are being used instead.\nPolymer foams have great thermal insulation properties and can also be tuned to have\ndifferent mechanical strength and moisture absorption.\nPolymer foams are widely used in all kinds of different applications because they can\nbe manufactured from many different types of polymers and there are plenty of different blowing\nagents available to customize the foam to specific requirements. Polymer foams can be made to be\nrigid or flexible by changing the chemistry, density, structure and raw materials used.\nBibliography\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nPlease see http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/jbsmse/v28n1/28260f1.gif\n\nAshida, K. «Polyurethane and Related Foams», Taylor and Francis, 2007\nKlempner, D., Sendijarevic, V. «Polymeric foams and Foam Technology» 2nd.ed.,\nHanser, 2004\nLee, S.-T., Park, C.B., Ramesh, N.S., «Polymer foams», Taylor and Francis, 2007\nKhemani, K.C., «Polymeric foams», American Chemical Society, 1996\nThrone, J., «Thermoplastic Foam Extrusion», Hanser, 2004\nGendron, R., «Thermoplastic Foam Processing», CRCPress, 2005\nUhlig, K., «Discovering polyurethanes», Hanser, 1999\n«Center for the polyurethanes industry»,\n<http://www.polyurethane.org/s_api/doc.asp?CID=853&DID=3488>, 16 May 2007\n«Making polyurethanes», <http://www.pslc.ws/macrog/uresyn.htm>, 16 May 2007"

Explain in about 200 words (a schematic may be\nuseful) why the block copolymer application is exciting and likely to solve an\nimportant problem and provide an important advantage.\n\n3.2 Dispersing Nanoparticles in Polymeric Matrices\n\n(a). The interaction between a nanoparticle and the host polymer is dependent\non the ligands on the surface of the nanoparticle and the relative sizes of the\nnanoparticles and the homopolymer chains. The ligand coating surrounding a\nnanoparticle has an interaction parameter with the segment of a homopolymer.\nDescribe the relative ability to homogeneously disperse a set of nanoparticles in a\nhomopolymer as a function of the interaction parameter, the size of the\nnanoparticle, the molecular weight of the ligands and the molecular weight of\nthe homopolymer matrix. Explain the relative \"dispersability\" of: small\nnanoparticles with negative chi in a low molecular weight polymer vs. larger\nnanoparicles with a positive chi in a high molecular weight polymer. Hint:\nthink Flory-Huggins theory, draw a schematic of the nanoparticle-ligand coating\nin the homopolymer matrix and identify important parameters that enter into the\nfree energy.\n\n(b). Explain using interaction parameters, symmetry, size and shape\nconsiderations, how the ligand coating and shape of a nanoparticle can influence\nits location in a block copolymer having a certain type of microdomain structure.\n\n(c). Suggest reasonable choices of diblock copolymer microdomain\nmorphologies for precisely sequestering and locating the following types of\ncarbon nanoparticles: C60 and a SWCNT in a block copolymer.\n\nC60 = Buckminsterfullerene\nSWCNT = single wall carbon nanotube\n\n3.3 Microphase Separation in Diblocks\n(a). Explain the \"max - min\" principle for understanding the thermodynamics of block\ncopolymer microphase separation.\n(b). Carefully draw and label the NChi vs. volume fraction morphology diagram for a\nA/B diblock. Label the ODT and the various regions of microdomain morphology.\n(c). Which microdomain types have an IMDS with constant mean curvature? Which\nmicrodomain types have a constant microdomain thickness? Why does the lamellar\nmicrodomain morphology exhibit the largest stability region in the morphology diagram?\n\n3.4 Templated Self Assembly and Pattern Transfer\n(a). One of the challenges that must be overcome if block copolymer lithography is to be\nsuccessful is the elimination of unwanted defects. Describe how you would design a\ntemplate (include a schematic of the actual template) that would be able to order spherical\nmicrodomains such that the template takes up a minimum area of the substrate and yet\nprovides a global single crystal array of microdomains over the entire wafer.\n(b). Pattern transfer into the substrate by the block copolymer lithographic mask requires\ncertain properties. Describe the various parameters that need to be considered in\nchoosing a suitable pair of blocks.\n\n3.5 ABC Architecture\n\n(a). Determine the total number of topologically distinct molecules for an ABC polymer\ncontaining loops and/or arms.\n(b). Which of the molecular architectures that you have drawn in part (a) will have the\njunctions confined to surfaces and which ones will have the junctions confined to lines?\n(c). Which molecule(s) (and compositions) from part (a) do you think would be the most\ninteresting microdomain morphologies? Why?"

We have encountered several situations that all\nrelated to what are termed \"polymer brushes:\"\n\n(i). The corona region of a diblock copolymer micelle\n(ii). Ligand chains tethered to a nanoparticle\n(iii). Blocks tethered to the IMDS between microdomains\n(iv). Noncrystalline blocks of a semicrystalline block copolymer lamella.\n\n(a). Draw schematics of each of the situations described in i - iv above and label\nthe key features.\n\n(b). Derive an expression to calculate the area per chain ! of a lamellar diblock\nfrom the individual block molecular weights, the lamellar repeat distance.\n\n(c). Derive an expression to calculate the area per chain ! for a chain folded\nlamellar crystal knowing the molecular weight of each block, the lamellar\ncrystalline core thickness, the c axis repeat distance of the crystalline block, the\ndensity of each component.\n\n4.2 Shape Memory Polymers\n\nMaterials are said to show a shape-memory effect if they can be deformed and\nfixed into a temporary shape, and then later, recover their original, permanent\nshape by an exposure to an external stimulus.\n\nConsult the paper by Bob Langer in Science, Vol 296, Issue 5573, 1673-\n1676, 31 May 2002\n\n\"Biodegradable, Elastic Shape-Memory Polymers for Potential Biomedical\nApplications\"\n\n3.063 Spring 95 E. L. Thomas Exam #2 p. 2\n(a). Explain why it may be advantageous to use shape memory polymers\nin biomedical devices and provide an example of a useful shape change\ndevice.\n\n(b). Explain Langer's choice of polymer and the key material and\nprocessing parameters needed to create the shape memory polymer.\n\n(c). High paid MIT Consultant: You've been tasked by management to\ncome up with a multiple step shape memory polymer (SMP) device that\ncan execute two successive and distinctive shape changes in orthogonal\ndirections for a new application. Having read about SMPs you decide to\nuse a semicrystalline block copolymer that has one noncrystalline block\nwith a Tg of 40C and one crystallizable block with a Tm of 60C and a Tg of -\n30C in order to attempt to realize two separate thermally triggered events.\nDescribe how you might prepare a suitable device out of this block\ncopolymer that would exhibit the required shape changes. Hint: consider\ntriggers in series and triggers in parallel.\n\n4.3 Templated Self Assembly\n\nUse of a template to pattern block copolymers can enable excellent long\nrange ordering of the domains due to the constraint of the template on the\nalignment and spacing of the microdomains. Below are SEM images of a\nmonolayer of PFS spherical domains confined between SiO2 walls after\nRIE processing of the PS/PFS diblock. (PS = polystyrene, PFS =\npoly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane). Purposeful introduction of defects can also be\nobtained using a patterned substrate. The figure below shows how the variation\nof the separation of a pair of confining walls induces periodic arrays of point\ndislocations (red \"perpendicular\" symbols). The environment around dislocation\ndefects in 2D (line defects in 3d become point defects in 2d) is alternatively 5\nnearest neighbors or 7 nearest neighbors. Normally the p6mm packing gives 6\nnearest neighbors. Such defects will localize light within the photonic crystal and\ndepending on the symmetry and geometry of the defect environment, various\ninteractions will occur.\n\n3.063 Spring 95 E. L.

In the PS/PFS diblock system, the PFS block prefers to wet the silica\nsurface of the substrate, while the majority PS block prefers to segregate\nto the upper (air) interface.

Describe the two factors that control the crystallization of a\nhomopolymer. Sketch the temperature dependence of the crystallization rate,\nC(Tc), over the interval Tg ! Tc ! Tm and give an explanation for why there is a\nmaximum in C(Tc).\n\n(b). Explain why the crystallization rate at a particular crystallization\ntemperature Tc in a blend of a crystallizable polymer A and a higher molecular\nweight non-crystallizable polymer B decreases by a factor of about 100 times\nwhen the content of B in the blend is increased from 0% to 50%. Note: polymers\nA and B form a miscible, single homogeneous melt at temperatures above the\nmelting point of polymer A. Also note that the glass transition temperature of the\nB polymer is considerably higher than that of the A polymer.\n\nA-B Polymer Blend\n\nRelative C(Tc)\n\n100% A, 0% B\n\n1.0\n\n50% A, 50% B\n\n0.01\n\n5.2 Crystalline Morphology\n\nPolyethylene is orthorhombic with space group Pnam. At room temperature, the\nunit cell parameters are:\n\na = 7.40 A\n\nb = 4.93 A\n\nc = 2.53 A (the chain axis direction)\n\nThere are two (_ CH2CH2 )_ monomer units per unit cell.\n\n(i)\nCalculate the crystal density at room temperature.\n\n(ii)\nIf the density of the amorphous phase of PE is 0.86 g/cm3 at room\ntemperature, calculate the percent crystallinity of a sample having a\nmeasured density of 0.94 g/cm3.\n\n(iii)\nThe small angle X-ray period for the lamellar sample of part (ii) was\nfound to be 340 A. Assuming a lamellar morphology, estimate the\naverage thickness of the crystal and noncrystalline regions. Hint:\n1D period P = lc + la\n\n(iv)\nEstimate the melting point of this sample based on fold surface\nenergy \"e = 0.042 J/m2 and equilibrium melting point of Tm° = 141°\nC.\n\n(v)\nHydrogenated 1,4 polybutadiene (PB) is essentially polyethylene\nexcept for some short branches due to the fact that the\npolymerization of butadiene always results in at least some 1,2 and\n3,4 isomers. When hydrogenated, these monomeric units give rise\nto butyl branches. Draw a representative portion of a polyethylene\nchain with a branch unit. Explain why the percent crystallinity and\nmelting point of hydrogenated PB is considerably lower (Tm = 98°\nC) than PE.\n\n5.3 Chain Folded Lamellae and Per Cent Crystallinity\n\n(a). The melting points of polyethylene crystals whose thickness was\nvaried by controlling the conditions of crystallization were investigated\nby DSC and by X-ray diffraction (SAXS). The following results were\nobtained:\n\nTm (°C)\n139.4\n137.5\n136.0\n134.9\n131.9\n127.9\n117.0\nl (A)\n\nPrepare a plot of Tm versus 1/l, and from the slope and intercept,\nrespectively, evaluate Tm° and the fold surface energy from these data.\nAssume the heat of fusion of 100% crystalline polyethylene is \"HV° =\n1.44 x 108 J/m3.\n\n(b). Crystallization can be thought of as a self organization process.\nEven in a simple, linear polymer, such as polyethylene, the material is\nnever 100% crystalline. Discuss at least 3 factors why the material\nalways exhibits a degree of crystallinity less than 100%.\n\n5.4 CNTs and Polymers\n\n(a). Argue the case that single wall carbon nanotubes can be well\ndescribed as just another type of polymer, albeit with certain unique\nfeatures. Discuss how the variation in rolling vector (n,m), tube diameter\nand tube length are related to conventional polymer descriptors such as\nstereochemistry of the monomer repeat and polydisperisity. Can you\ndescribe two different types of polydispersity index for CNT's?\n\n(b). In the future, it may be possible to find synthetic conditions such that\ntruly monodisperse tube types can be made in high yield. This should\nlead to outstanding physical properties. Describe your choice of optimum\ntype of tube and state your reason why (SWNT vs MWNT and (n,m) value\nif appropriate) for the following properties: (in case cite the anticipated\nideal value of the property and compare it to an exisiting material).\n\n(i). Tensile modulus\n\n`\n(ii). Tensile strength\n\n(iii). Thermal conductivity\n\n(iv). Electrical conductivity"
