Then 1 x > 0 because the product of two positive\n2 ·\nquantities is positive. Thus x\n2 + 0 < x\n2 + x\n2 (because y < z implies x + y < x + z for all x), i.e.,\nx\nx\nx\n< x. Also, since \" :=\n> 0 we have by assumption that x\n. However, for a strict order\nat most one of x < x\n2 and x\n2 < x can be true. Hence we obtain a contradiction to the assumption\nx > 0. Thus x >→\n0. Since x 0, this implies x = 0, as desired.\n2.(a) We use 2xy x2 + y2 (which follows from (x - y)2 0) and an 0 to estimate\n0 < panan+1 1(pan\n2 + pan+1\n2) = 1 an + 1 an+1.\n∑\n∑\nNext, the partial sums of\nn\n=1 an+1 are the same ones (shifted by one - see (b)) as for\nn\n=1 an, and\n∑\nso by assumption both series converge. Hence by linearity for limits, the series\n+ 1\n∑\nn=1 2 an\n2 an+1\nalso converges. Now convergence of\n1 panan+1 follows from the comparison criterion.\nn=1\n∑\n(b) Since an+1 an we obtain 0 an+1 panan+1, so\nconverges by the comparison\n∑k\n∑k-1\nn=1 an+1\n∑k\ntest. But now limk!1\nn=1 an+1 exists iff limk!1\nn=0 an+1 = limk!1\nexists; proving\nn=1 an\nconvergence of the latter.\n3.(a) Both f(x) = 4x(1 - x) and f(x) = 1 -|2x - 1| work nicely.\n(b) No function: continuous functions take connected sets to connected sets.\n(c) Define\n{\nf(x) =\n0,\nx 1,\n1,\nx 2.\nThis function is continuous on [0, 1] ∈ [2, 3] and f([0, 1] ∈ [2, 3]) = {0, 1}.\n(d) No function: suppose such a function f exists. There exists x1 for which f(x1) = 1 and x2 for\nwhich f(x2) = 2, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem there is x between x1 and x2 for which\nf(x) =\np\n2, a contradiction. (Or, use connectedness again.)\n(e) No function: continuous functions take compact sets to compact sets.\n4. Given \" > 0, by uniform convergence of (fn), we can choose some N ⊂ N such that n N\nimplies |fn(x) - f(x) < \" for all x ⊂ E. By uniform continuity of fN , we can choose some such\nthat d(x, y) < implies |fN (x) - fN (y)| < . Then for any x, y ⊂ E such that d(x, y) < we have\n|f(x) - f(y)| = |f(x) - fN (x) + fN (x) - fN (y) + fN (y) - f(y)|\n|f(x) - fN (x)| + |fN (x) - fN (y)| + |fN (y) - f(y)|\nso f is uniformly continuous.\n5. (see Melrose Test 2)\n6. (see Melrose Test 2)\n\n7.(a) For all \" > 0, there exists a (countable) collection {B(xi, ri)} of open balls such that N ≤\nB(xi, ri) and\ni ri < \".\ni\n(b) We have {x\nf(x) = f(x)} = inf has measure 0, so f ⊆ f. The relation is symmetric since\n{x | g(x) = f(x)}\n|\n= {x |\n→\ng(x) = f(x)}. To check is transitivity assume f ⊆ g and g ⊆ h. Observe\n→\n→\nthat if f(x) = h(x) then we must have either f(x) = g(x) or g(x) = h(x) (or both), so\n→\n→\n→\n{x | f(x) →\n| f(x) = g(x)} ∈{x | f(x) =\n→\ng(x)}.\n= h(x)} {x\n→\nSo we must show that unions and subsets of measure-0 sets have measure 0. For subsets, just take\na covering of the superset of measure 0 to cover its subset. For the union, take the union of two\ncoverings of measure less than \"/2 to cover the union with sets of total measure less than \".\n(c) Since f and g are both integrable, f - g is integrable as well, and we are asked to show that\nf - g = 0 given that f - g = 0 almost everywhere. Since f - g is integrable, the integral is\nequal to the infimum over all upper Riemann sums. Since f - g is zero almost everywhere, every\ninterval contains a point at which f - g = 0, so the upper Riemann sum for any fixed partition is a\nsum of nonnegative numbers and thus nonnegative. The infimum of a set of nonnegative quantities\n∫ 1\nmust itself be nonnegative, so\nf - g 0. However, we may apply identical reasoning to get that\n∫ 1\ng - f 0. Since these two quantities are negatives of each other, they both must equal 0, as\nneeded.\n8.(a) Fix \" > 0. For each fi, choose a i such that d(x, y) < i implies |fi(x) - fi(y)| < \" for all\nx, y. Then let = min{i} > 0 and we have that for any fi ⊂ F and any x, y in the common\ndomain that if d(x, y) < then |fi(x) - fi(y) < \", so F is equicontinuous.\n(b) Let = \"/n. If |x - y| < then\n|\n∑\n∪\n∫ 1\n|fn(x) - fn(y)| =\nx\nx + 1\nn\n-\ny\ny + 1\nn\n=\n|x-y|\nn\n|x-y|\nn\n= n|x - y| < \",\nx + 1\ny + 1\nn\n·\nn\nn\nso fn is uniformly continuous for all n.\n(c) We have fn(0) = 0 for all n and fn(x) ≥ 1 as n ≥∼ for any fixed x ⊂ (0, 1], so (fn) converges\npointwise to the function\nf(x) =\n{\n0,\nx = 0\n1,\nx ⊂ (0, 1].\nHowever, fn( n\n1 ) = 1\n2 for all n, so for all n there exists x such that d(fn(x), f(x)) > 1\n3 . Thus\nno subsequence of the (fn) can converge uniformly. (Alternatively, invoke problem 4 here: if\nconvergence were uniform, the limit function would be uniformly continuous, when in fact it's\nnot even continuous.) In addition, we have 0 fn(x) 1 for all n ⊂ N and all x ⊂ [0, 1], so\n(fn) is uniformly bounded. By Arzel`a-Ascoli, any equicontinuous pointwise bounded sequence of\ncontinuous functions has a uniformly convergent subsequence, so it follows that our sequence of\nfunctions is not equicontinuous.\n9. see Melrose Test 1 .. hence no solution here\n\n10.(a) Choose some f such that f(x0) = c = 0. Then if\n→\nd1(f, g) < |\nc|, it follows that\n|g(x0)| = |g(x0) - f(x0) + f(x0)|\n|f(x0)| - |f(x0) - g(x0)|\n|f(x0)| - sup |f(x) - g(x)|\nx2X\n> |c| - |\nc|\n> 0,\nso g(x0) = 0. Thus there is an open ball in K0\nC around every element of K0\nC , so K0\nC is open and\n→\nthus K0 is closed.\n(b) Denote the set of the previous part by K0(x). Then\n∩\nK1 =\nK0(x)\nx2E\nis an intersection of closed sets, and so closed. We showed on one of the problem sets that if two\ncontinuous functions agree on a dense subset of a metric space then they agree on the whole space,\nso it follows that actually K1 = {z} where z is the function such that z(x) = 0 for all x.\n(c) We have that actually B = B1(z) is the open ball of radius 1 centered at the all-zero function\nz, and we've shown that an open ball in any metric space is an open set. (As a reminder of this\ngeneral result: choose any x ⊂ Br(z), and let d = d(x, z) < r. Then for any y ⊂ Br-d(x) we have\nd(z, y) d(z, x) + d(x, y) < d + (r - d) = r, so y ⊂ Br(z), as needed.)\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.100B Analysis I\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "COMPACTNESS VS. SEQUENTIAL COMPACTNESS\nThe aim of this handout is to provide a detailed proof of the equivalence between the two\ndefinitions of compactness: existence of a finite subcover of any open cover, and existence of a limit\npoint of any infinite subset.\nDefinition 1. K is compact if every open cover of K contains a finite subcover. K is sequentially\ncompact if every infinite subset of K has a limit point in K.\nTheorem 1. K is compact ⇐⇒ K is sequentially compact.\nThe first half of this statement (compact =⇒ sequentially compact) is Theorem 2.37 in Rudin and\nis proved there. Our aim is to prove the converse implication (sequentially compact =⇒ compact),\nfollowing the lines of Exercises 23, 24 and 26 in Rudin Chapter 2.\nThe proof requires the introduction of two auxiliary notions:\nDefinition 2. A space X is separable if it admits a countable dense subset.\nFor example R is separable (Q is countable, and it is dense since every real number is a limit of\nrationals); for the same reason Rk is separable (consider all points with only rational coordinates).\nDefinition 3. A collection {Vα} of open subsets of X is said to be a base for X if the following\nis true: for every x ∈ X and for every open set G ⊂ X such that x ∈ G, there exists α such that\nx ∈ Vα ⊂ G.\nIn other words, every open subset of X decomposes as a union of a subcollection of the Vα's - the\nVα's \"generate\" all open subsets. The family {Vα} almost always contains infinitely many members\n(the only exception is if X is finite). However, if X happens to be separable, then countably many\nopen subsets are enough to form a base (the converse statement is also true and is an easy exercise):\nLemma 1. Every separable metric space has a countable base.\nProof. Assume X is separable: by definition it contains a countable dense subset P = {p1, p2, . . . }.\nConsider the countable collection of neighborhoods {Nr(pi), r ∈ Q, i = 1, 2, . . . }. We show that it\nis a base by checking the definition.\nConsider any open set G ⊂ X and any point x ∈ G. Since G is open, there exists r > 0 such that\nNr(x) ⊂ G. Decreasing r if necessary we can assume without loss of generality that r is rational.\nSince P is dense, by definition x is a limit point of P, so Nr/2(x) contains a point of P. So there\nexists i such that d(x, pi) < 2\nr . Since r is rational, the neighborhood Nr/2(pi) belongs to the chosen\ncollection. Moreover, Nr/2(pi) ⊂ Nr(x) ⊂ G. Finally, since d(x, pi) < 2\nr we also have x ∈ Nr/2(pi).\nSo the chosen collection is a base for X.\n\nLemma 2. If X is sequentially compact then it is separable.\nProof. Fix δ > 0, and let x1 ∈ X. Choose x2 ∈ X such that d(x1, x2) ≥ δ, if possible. Having chosen\nx1, . . . , xj, choose xj+1 (if possible) such that d(xi, xj+1) ≥ δ for all i = 1, . . . , j. We first notice\nthat this process has to stop after a finite number of iterations. Indeed, otherwise we would obtain\nan infinite sequence of points xi mutually distant by at least δ; since X is sequentially compact the\ninfinite subset {xi, i = 1, 2, . . . } would admit a limit point y, and the neighborhood Nδ/2(y) would\ncontain infinitely many of the xi's, contradicting the fact that any two of them are distant by at\nleast δ. So after a finite number of iterations we obtain x1, . . . , xj such that Nδ(x1)∪. . . Nδ(xj) = X\n(every point of X is at distance < δ from one of the xi's).\nWe now consider this construction for δ = 1 (n = 1, 2, . . . ). For n = 1 the construction gives\nn\npoints x11, . . . , x1j1 such that N1(x11)∪· · · ∪ N1(x1j1 ) = X, for n = 2 we get x21, . . . , x2j2 such that\n\nT\nT\nCOMPACTNESS VS. SEQUENTIAL COMPACTNESS\nN1/2(x21 ∪· · ·∪ N1/2(x2j2 ) = X, and so on. Let S = {xki, k ≥ 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ jk}: clearly S is countable.\nWe claim that S is dense (i.e. S = X). Indeed, if x ∈X and r > 0, the neighborhood Nr(x) always\ncontains at least a point of S (choosing n so that n\n1 < r, one of the xni's is at distance less than r\nfrom x), so every point of X either belongs to S or is a limit point of S, i.e. S = X.\n\nAt this point we know that every sequentially compact set has a countable base. We now show\nthat this is enough to get countable subcovers of any open cover.\nLemma 3. If X has a countable base, then every open cover of X admits an at most countable\nsubcover.\nProof. Homework\nThe final ingredient is the following:\nLemma 4. If {Fn} is a sequence of non-empty closed subsets of a sequentially compact set K such\nthat Fn ⊃Fn+1 for all n = 1, 2, . . . , then Tinf\nn=1 Fn\n∅.\n=\n(Since we know at this point that every compact set is sequentially compact, and since compact\nsubsets are closed, this lemma implies immediately the Corollary to Theorem 2.36 in Rudin).\nProof. Take xn ∈ Fn for each integer n, and let E = {xn, n = 1, 2, . . . }. If E is finite then one of\nthe xi belongs to infinitely many Fn's. Since F1 ⊃ F2 ⊃ . . . , this implies that xi belongs to every\nFn, and we get that T inf\nn=1 Fn is not empty.\nAssume now that E is infinite. Since K is sequentially compact, E has a limit point y. Fix a\nvalue of n: every neighborhood of y contains infinitely many points of E; among them, we can find\none which is of the form xi for i ≥ n and therefore belongs to Fn (because xi ∈ Fi ⊂ Fn). Since\nevery neighborhood of y contains a point of Fn, we get that either y ∈ Fn, or y is a limit point of\nFn; however since Fn is closed, every limit point of Fn belongs to Fn. So in either case we conclude\ninf\nintersection is not empty.\n\nWe can now prove the theorem. Assume that K is sequentially compact, and let {Gα} be an\nopen cover of K. By Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, K has a countable base, so by Lemma 3 {Gα} admits\nan at most countable subcover that we will denote {Gi}i≥1. Our aim is to show that {Gi} admits\na finite subcover (which will also be a finite subcover of {Gα}). If {Gi} only contains finitely many\nmembers, we are already done; so assume that there are infinitely many Gi's, and assume that for\nevery value of n we have G1 ∪· · · ∪Gn ⊃ K (else we have found a finite subcover).\nLet Fn = {x ∈K, x ∈ G1 ∪· · ·∪ Gn} = K ∩Gc\n1 ∩· · ·∩ Gc\nn. Because the Gi are open, Fn is closed;\nby assumption Fn is non-empty; and clearly Fn ⊃ Fn+1 for all n. Therefore, applying Lemma 4 we\nthat y ∈ Fn. Since this holds for every n, we obtain that y ∈\nFn, which proves that the\nn=1\nobtain that\ninf\nn=1 Fn\n∅, i.e. there exists a point y ∈\n· · · ∪Gn\n=\nK such that y ∈ G1 ∪\nfor every n.\nWe conclude that y ∈ S inf\ni=1 Gi, which is a contradiction since the open sets Gi cover K.\nSo there exists a value of n such that G1, . . . , Gn cover K. We conclude that every open cover\nof K admits a finite subcover, and therefore that K is compact.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.100B Analysis I\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "CONSTRUCTION OF R\n1. MOTIVATION\nWe are used to thinking of real numbers as successive approximations. For example,\nwe write\nπ = 3.14159 . . .\nto mean that π is a real number which, accurate to 5 decimal places, equals the above\nstring. To be precise, this means that |π - 3.14159| < 1 × 10-5 . But this does not tell us\nwhat π is. If we want a more accurate approximation, we can calculate one; to 10 decimal\nplaces, we have π = 3.1415926536 . . . Continuing, we will develop a sequence of rational\napproximations to π. One such sequence is\n3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.142, 3.1416, 3.14159, . . .\nBut this is not the only sequence of rational numbers that approximate π closer and closer\n(far from it!). For example, here is another (important) one:\n22 333 355 104348 1043835\n3,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n. . .\n7 106 113\n(This sequence, which represents the continued fractions approximations to π [you should\nread about continued fractions for fun!], gives accuracies of 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 9 decimal digits,\nas you can readily check.) More's the point, here is another (somewhat arbitrary) rational\napproximating sequence to π:\n0, 0, 157, -45, -10, 3.14159, 0, 3.14, 3.1415, 3.151592, 3.14159265, . . .\nWhile here we start with a string of numbers that really have nothing to do with π, the\nsequence eventually settles down to approximate π closer and closer (this time by an\nadditional 2 decimal places each step). The point is, just what the sequence does for\nany initial segment of time is irrelevant; all that matters is what happens to the tail of the\nsequence.\nWe are going to use the above insights to actually give a construction of the real numbers\nR from the rational numbers Q. The idea is, a real number is a sequence of rational ap\nproximations. But we have to be careful since, as we saw above, very different sequences\nof rational numbers can equally well approximate the same real number. To take care of\nthis ambiguity, we will have to define real numbers as sets of rational approximating\nsequences, all with the same tail behaviour. To make this precise, the following section\ncontains precise definitions and some theorems which we will need to set out the formal\nmathematical construction of R (as envisioned by Bolzano and Cauchy in the early 19th\ncentury).\n2. CAUCHY SEQUENCES\nWe have already been working with sequences, but to be sure we're on the same page:\nDefinition 1. A sequence of rational numbers (aka a rational sequence) is a function from\nthe natural numbers N into the rational numbers Q. That is, it is an assignment of a rational\nnumber to each natural number. We usually denote such a function by n 7→ an, so the terms in\nthe sequence are written {a1, a2, a3, . . .} To refer to the whole sequence, we will write (an)inf\nn=1, or\nfor the sake of brevity simply (an).\n\nWe are interested primarily in the tail behaviour of a sequence. There is a wide variety\nof different behaviours a sequence may have as we follow it along. The following are two\nimportant, related behaviours which we will need now, and which will also be important\nto us all term. The first is tending to 0. Put simply, a sequences tends to 0 if the tail gets (and\nstays) arbitrarily small. That is: given any small positive rational number ω, eventually\nthe terms in the sequence are all < ω in absolute value.\nDefinition 2. Let (an) be a rational sequence. Say that (an) tends to 0 if, given any small ω > 0,\nthere is a natural number N = Nω such that, after N (i.e. for all n > N), |an| ≤ ω. We often\ndenote this symbolically by an\n0.\n→\nA typical example given is the sequence an = 1/n (though zillions of others will do, of\ncourse). Given any small rational ω > 0, if we want 1/N < ω, we simply have to choose\nN > 1/ω. Here we are directly using the fact that Q is an Archimedian field. Note, also, that\nin this case, since 1/n < 1/N whenever n > N, we will have that |an| = 1/n < 1/N < ω.\nThus, we have proves that the sequence (1/n) tends to 0.\nWe can also, at this point, define what it means for a sequence to tend to any given\nrational number q: (an) tends to q if the sequence (an - q) tends to 0. (For example: the\nsequence with terms an = n/(n +1) tends to 1, since an - 1 = -1/(n +1) which, following\nan argument like the one above, tends to 0.) We should note that another word used to\ndescribe a sequence tending to some number is convergence: we say that a 1/n converges\nto 0.\nThe next definition involves something closely related to convergence, but which is\nsubtly different. Consider, for example, a sequence of rational approximations to π,\nsuch as 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.142, 3.1416, 3.14159, . . . This sequence is not converging to any ratio\nnal number. But it looks like it's tending to something - the terms are getting closer and\ncloser to each other (very quickly, in fact - by a factor of 10 at each successive step). The\nsequence is then said to be a Cauchy sequence.\nDefinition 3. Let (an) be a rational sequence. We call (an) a Cauchy sequence if the difference\nbetween its terms tends to 0. To be precise: given any small rational number ω, there is a natural\nnumber N = Nω such that for any m, n > N, |an - am| < ω.\nThe following theorem tells us that the notion of convergence is stronger than Cauchy-\nness.\nTheorem 4. If (an) is a convergent rational sequence (that is, an\nq for some rational number\nq), then (an) is a Cauchy sequence.\n→\nProof. We know that an\nq. Here is a ubiquitous trick: instead of using ω in the defini\n→\ntion, start with an arbitrary small ω > 0, and then choose N so that |an - q| < ω/2 when\nn > N. Then if m, n > N, we have\nω\nω\n|an - am| = |(an - q) - (am - q)| ≤|an - q| + |am - q| < 2 + 2 = ω.\nThis shows that (an) is a Cauchy sequence.\n\nOur intuition tells us that, if the terms get closer and closer to each other, they must\nbe getting closer and closer to something. It is this intuition which motivated Cauchy\nto use such sequences to define the real numbers: R is a completion of Q. The sequence\n\n3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.142, 3.1416, 3.14159, . . . is Cauchy but does not converge to a rational number;\nhence, there must be some irrational number to which it converges, and we will complete\nthe rationals by adding it (and all the other numbers to which Cauchy sequences look like\nthey're tending).\nThe next theorem shows that, even though a Cauchy sequence may not converge, it\ncertainly can't get arbitrarily large.\nTheorem 5. If (an) is a Cauchy sequence, then it is bounded; that is, there is some large number\nM such that |an| ≤ M for all n.\nProof. Since (an) is Cauchy, setting ω = 1 we know that there is some N such that\nan| < 1 whenever m, n > N. Thus, |aN+1 - an| < 1 for n > N. We can rewrite this as\n|am -\naN+1 - 1 < an < aN+1 + 1.\nThis means that |an| is less than the maximum of |aN+1 - 1| and |aN+1 +1|. So, set M equal\nto the maximum number in the following list:\n{|a0|, |a1|, . . . , |aN |, |aN+1 - 1|, |aN+1 + 1|} .\nThen for any term an, if n ≤ N, then |an| appears in the list and so |an| ≤ M; if n > N,\nthen (as shown above) |an| is less than at least one of the last two entries in the list, and so\n|an| ≤ M. Hence, M is a bound for the sequence.\n\nWe will use Theorem 5 in Section 4 to verify the field axioms for our newly-minted real\nnumbers.\n3. EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS\nWe are now almost ready to discuss Cauchy's construction of the real number system.\nWe will define a real number (almost) as: a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers. However,\nas discussed in Section 1, we need to deal with the ambiguity presented by different se\nquences converging to the same number. Hence, we will need to group Cauchy sequences\ninto sets, all of which have the same tail behaviour, and we will define a real number to\nbe such a set of Cauchy sequences.\nThe question is, how do we properly define the sets? This is a case where we have a\nlarge collection of objects, and we want to divide them into groups by similar behaviour.\nThis situation comes up extremely often in mathematics. One method would be to label a\ncollection of bins, and then toss all the elements into the different bins accordingly. The\nproblem with this is that it can often be very difficult to come up with the labels: where\ndoes one even begin? In our case, we would need to label the bins explicitly with all\nthe different possible tail behaviours of sequences, and that is an arduous task indeed.\nIn general, there is a procedure for grouping objects which does not require labelling.\nInstead, we divide our objects into equivalence classes.\nThe important idea is the following: suppose we have already grouped the objects into\nbins. For example, we group all human beings into families. Then we notice the following\nvery simple facts about families: first, any person is related to him- or herself, automat\nically. Now, if Sally is related to Tom, then Tom is related to Sally (we say that relation\nis symmetric). And finally, there is transitivity, which is an important way of recognizing\n\nrelation: if Sally is related to Tom, and Tom is related to Rachel, then Sally is also related\nto Rachel.\nThese three properties of family relation are, in fact, all that is necessary to group a set\ninto smaller, non-intersecting sets (as we'll see below). So we begin by abstracting the\nnotion of family relation to equivalence relation.\nDefinition 6. Let S be a set of (mathematical) objects. A relation among pairs of elements of S is\nsaid to be an equivalence relation if the following three properties hold:\nReflexivity: for any s ∈ S, s is related to s.\nSymmetry: for any s, t ∈ S, if s is related to t then t is related to s.\nTransitivity: for any s, t, r ∈ S, if s is related to t and t is related to r, then s is related to r.\nThe following proposition goes most of the way to showing that an equivalence relation\ndivides a set into bins.\nTheorem 7. Let S be a set, with an equivalence relation on pairs of elements. For s ∈ S, denote\nby [s] the set of all elements in S that are related to s. Then for any s, t ∈ S, either [s] = [t] or [s]\nand [t] are disjoint.\nProof. Let s, t be any two elements of s. Let us assume that there is some element r which\nis in both [s] and [t]; in other words, r is related to s and r is related to t. Now, let a be any\nelement in [s]. Since a is related to s and s is related to r (by symmetry), by transitivity a is\nrelated to r. But r is also related to t, so (again by transitivity) a is related to t. This means\nthat a ∈ [t]. We have thus demonstrated that [s] ⊆ [t]. But the other inclusion follows by\nalmost exactly the same argument: if b ∈ [t], then b is related to t, and since t is related to\nr (by symmetry), b is related to r by transitivity. But r is related to s, so by transitivity b is\nrelated to s. Hence, b ∈ [s], and so [t] ⊆ [s]. Hence, [t] = [s] if they have even one element\nin their intersection.\n\nThe sets [s] for s ∈ S are called the equivalence classes, and they are the bins.\nThe astute observer will notice that the above proof never used the reflexive property\nof the relation. In fact, the result holds perfectly well for relations that are symmetric and\ntransitive but not reflexive. The only trouble is that without reflexivity, an element may\nnot be related to anything. If so, that element won't be in any equivalence class - it won't\nget sorted into a bin at all. But reflexivity saves the day.\nCorollary 8. If S is a set with an equivalence relation on pairs of elements, then the equivalence\nclasses are non-empty disjoint sets whose union is all of S.\nProof. We have already seen, in Proposition 7 that different equivalence classes are dis\njoint. Now, by reflexivity, for each s ∈ S, s ∈ [s], and so each equivalence class is\nnonempty (containing at least one element). Also, since each s ∈ S is in an equivalence\nclass, the union of all classes is the whole set S.\n\nTo summarize: any equivalence relation will divide a set into bins, without the need to\nexplicitly label them. Moreover, as discussed above, if we already have a set divided into\nbins, then there is an equivalence relation lurking about: we declare to elements to be\nrelated if they are in the same bin. So equivalence relations are just another way of divid\ning sets into small pieces; any such division may be accomplished with an equivalence\nrelation.\n\n4. CAUCHY'S CONSTRUCTION OF R\nWe now stand ready to give Cauchy's construction of R. The real numbers will be\nconstructed as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences. Let CQ denote the set of all Cauchy\nsequences of rational numbers. We must define an equivalence relation on CQ.\nDefinition 9. Let (an) and (bn) be in CQ. Say they are equivalent (i.e. related) if an - bn\n0; i.e.\nif the sequence (an - bn) tends to 0.\n→\nThe point of this definition is precisely what we had in mind for the equivalence classes\nto represent real numbers. To say that an-bn → 0 means that the tails of the two sequences\nget, and stay, arbitrarily close to each other: the two sequences have the same tail behaviour.\nBut to be precise, we need to make sure that, indeed, Definition 9 gives an equivalence\nrelation.\nProposition 10. Definition 9 yields an equivalence relation on CQ.\nProof. we need to show that this relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n- Reflexive: an - an = 0, and the sequence all of whose terms are 0 clearly converges\nto 0. So (an) is related to (an).\n- Symmetric: Suppose (an) is related to (bn), so an -bn → 0. But bn -an = -(an -bn),\nand since only the absolute value |an - bn| = |bn - an| comes into play in Definition\n2, it follows that bn - an → 0 as well. Hence, (bn) is related to (an).\n- Transitive: Here we will use the ω/2 trick we applied to prove Theorem 4. Suppose\n(an) is related to (bn), and (bn) is related to (cn). This means that an - bn\n0 and\nbn - cn → 0. To be fully precise, let us fix a small ω > 0; then there exists an\n→\nN such\nthat for all n > N, |an - bn| < ω/2; also, there exists an M such that for all n > M,\n|bn - cn| < ω/2. Well, then, as long as n is bigger than both N\nω\nand\nω\nM, we have that\n|an - cn| = |(an - bn) + (bn - cn)| ≤|an - bn| + |bn - cn| < 2 + 2 = ω.\nSo, choosing L equal to the max of N, M, we see that given ω > 0 we can always\nchoose L so that for n > L, |an - cn| < ω. This means that an - cn → 0 - i.e. (an) is\nrelated to (cn).\nSo, we really have an equivalence relation, and so by Corollary 8, the set CQ is parti\ntioned into disjoint subsets (equivalence classes). Now, hold your breath. . . here it comes. . .\nDefinition 11. The real numbers R are the equivalence classes [(an)] of Cauchy sequences of\nrational numbers, as per Definition 9. That is, each such equivalence class is a real number.\nGreat! Now we know what real numbers are. Except. . . do we? We have a formal\nconstruction, which produces a set of objects. But the real numbers we know (and perhaps\nlove) have lots of structure to them, as spelled out by the field axioms, order axioms, and\nleast upper bound property, as spelled out in §1.5 - 1.19 in [1]. In fact, we need to work\nharder in order to recognize these equivalence classes as real numbers. In fact, we are\nused to Q being a subset of R, but as we've constructed R, it's hard to see Q. Let's squint\na little.\nDefinition 12. Given any rational number q, define a real number q to be the equivalence class of\nthe sequence (q, q, q, q, . . .) consisting entirely of q.\n\nSo we view Q as being inside R by thinking of each rational number q as its associated\nequivalence class q . It is standard to abuse this notation, and simply refer to the equiva\nlence class as q as well.\nOkay, so we know where the rationals sit. But what about the algebraic structure of R?\nBefore we can verify field axioms, we need to decide what it means to add two equiv\nalence classes of Cauchy sequences; to multiply them; what 1 and 0 are. Before we can\nverify the order axioms, we need to know what it means to say [(an)] < [(bn)] in the first\nplace!\nDefinition 13. Let s, t ∈ R, so there are Cauchy sequences (an), (bn) of rational numbers with\ns = [(an)] and t = [(bn)].\n(a) Define s + t to be the equivalence class of the sequence (an + bn).\n(b) Define s t to be the equivalence class of the sequence (an · bn).\n·\nOkay, so now we have all the main players, and all we need to do is verify the field\naxioms (to see that R is a field), right? Well, not quite. You see, there's a catch when\nyou define things using equivalence relations. If you ever wish to define some operation\non equivalence classes, you can't just willy-nilly define it for one member of the class\nand expect it to make sense for all members of the class. If we are thinking in terms of\nfamily relation, one could consider applying the property \"is friendly with a Montague\"\nto Juliet, which is surely true (she was very friendly with Romeo). However, this property\nmost certainly does not extend to her father, head of the Capulets, who were practically\nat war with the Montagues!\nWe wish to define the real number [(an)] + [(bn)] to be simply [(an + bn)], `a la Definition\n13(a). In mathematical terms, the Montagues vs. Capulets problem is just this: the real\nnumber [(an)] is represented by a zillion other sequences, like [(cn)] (for example, with\n(an) = (1, 1, 1, 1, . . .) and (cn) = (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.999, . . .)). Similarly, [(bn)] = [(dn)] for a\nzillion other (dn)s. So, what makes us think that, just because [(an)] = [(cn)] and [(bn)] =\n[(dn)] that [(an + bn)] = [(cn + dn)]? In fact, there's no a priori reason we should think this\nis the case. We need to prove that this works, in order to show that the method of addition\nwe've laid out is well-defined.\nProposition 14. The operations +, in Definition 13(a),(b) are well defined.\n·\nProof. Suppose that [(an)] = [(cn)] and [(bn)] = [(dn)]. Thus means that an - cn → 0 and\nbn - dn → 0. Then (an + bn) - (cn + dn) = (an - cn) + (bn - dn). Now, using the familiar\nω/2 trick, you can construct a proof that this tends to 0, and so [(an + bn)] = [(cn + dn)].\nMultiplication is a little trickier; this is where we will use Theorem 5. We will also\nuse another ubiquitous technique: adding 0 in the form of s - s. Again, suppose that\n[(an)] = [(cn)] and [(bn)] = [(dn)]; we wish to show that [(an · bn)] = [(cn · dn)], or, in other\nwords, that an · bn - cn · dn → 0. Well, we add and subtract one of the other cross terms,\nsay bn · cn:\nan · bn - cn · dn = an · bn + (bn · cn - bn · cn) - cn · dn\n= (an · bn - bn · cn) + (bn · cn - cn · dn)\n= bn · (an - cn) + cn · (bn - dn).\n\nHence, we have |an · bn - cn · dn| ≤|bn| · |an - cn| + |cn| · |bn - dn|. Now, from Theorem\n5, there are numbers M and L such that |bn| ≤ M and |cn| ≤ L for all n. Taking some\nnumber R (for example = M + L) which is bigger than both, we have\n|an · bn - cn · dn| ≤|bn| · |an - cn| + |cn| · |bn - dn| ≤ R(|an - cn| + |bn - dn|).\nNow, noting that both an - cn and bn - dn tend to 0 and using the ω/2 trick (actually, this\ntime we'll want to use ω/2R, I suggest you work out the details), we see that an · bn - cn ·\ndn\n0. Whew!\n\n→\nSo, now that we have well-defined operations, it behooves us to prove that R, equipped\nwith them, is a field. This is a long and laborious task, and we shall not really work\nthrough it here; the interested reader should be in a position to prove the field axioms\nhim- or herself! We will work out one slightly trickier example here, just to give a flavour.\nTheorem 15. Given any real number s = 0\n, there is a real number t such that s · t = 1.\nProof. First we must properly understand what the theorem says. The premise is that s\nis nonzero, which means that s is not in the equivalence class of (0, 0, 0, 0, . . .). In other\nwords, s = [(an)] where an - 0 does not converge to 0. From this, we are to deduce the\nexistence of a real number t = [(bn)] such that s\nt = [(an bn)] is the same equivalence\n·\n·\nclass as [(1, 1, 1, 1, . . .)]. Doing so is actually an easy consequence of the fact that nonzero\nrational numbers have multiplicative inverses, but there is a subtle difficulty. Just because\ns is nonzero (i.e. (an) does not tend to 0), there's no reason any number of the terms in\n(an) can't equal 0. However, it turns out that eventually, an = 0\n. That is,\nLemma 16. If (an) is a Cauchy sequence which does not tend to 0, then there is an N such that,\nfor n > N, an = 0.\nThe proof of Lemma 16 is left to you. We will now use it to complete the proof of Theorem\n15.\nLet N be such that an =6\n0 for n > N. Define a sequence bn of rational numbers as fol\nlows: for n ≤ N, bn = 0, and for n > N, bn = 1/an; (bn) = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1/aN+1, 1/aN+2, . . .).\n(This makes sense since, for n > N, an is a nonzero rational number, so 1/an exists.) Then\nan bn is equal to an 0 = 0 for n ≤ N, and equals an bn = an 1/an = 1 for n > N.\n·\n·\n·\n·\nWell, then, if we look at the sequence (1, 1, 1, 1, . . .), we have (1, 1, 1, 1, . . .) - (an · bn) is the\nsequence which is 1 - 0 = 0 for n ≤ N and equals 1 - 1 = 0 for n > N. Since this sequence\nis eventually equal to 0, it converges to 0, and so [(an · bn)] = [(1, 1, 1, 1, . . .)] = 1 ∈ R. This\nshows that t = [(bn)] is a multiplicative inverse to s = [(an)].\nOur choice of (bn) to start with 0s was arbitrary; we could have chosen it to equal 17\nuntil after the Nth stage, or chosen each term randomly from Q; the only important choice\nis that bn = 1/an for n > N.\nFollowing proofs that are generally easier than this one, we can show that R, +, is a\n·\nfield. Now, we want R to be an ordered field, which means there is an order relation < on\nR which respects the field operations, as spelled out in §1.5 and 1.17 of [1]. Like before,\nhaving newly constructed these \"real\" numbers, we must define what it means for one to\nbe less than another. We will take our intuition from rational approximating sequences\nagain. How do we know that π > 3.141592? Well, 3 isn't greater than 3.141592, nor is 3.14.\n\n3.142 is, as is 3.1416, but 3.14159 is not. However, eventually, after a certain stage in this\napproximating sequence to π (once we get past the 6th decimal digit), we find that all the\nterms in the sequence after some point are greater than 3.141592.\nDefinition 17. Let s ∈ R. Say that s is positive if s =6\n0, and if s = [(an)] for some Cauchy\nsequence such that for some N, an > 0 for all n > N. Given two real numbers s, t, say that s > t\nif s - t is positive.\nAgain, to be fully rigorous we would have to show that this definition is well-defined\n(that if any one Cauchy sequence in the equivalence class of s eventually has only positive\nterms, then any other Cauchy sequence in the same equivalence class eventually has only\npositive terms). This is an exercise similar to other proofs in these notes and on your\nhomework; the interested reader can fill in the details.\nNow, we can verify all of the order axioms hold for R. As with the field axioms, this\nis a laborious task and is best done by each person in private. We will provide a proof of\none of the axioms here, just for flavour.\nTheorem 18. Let s, t be real numbers such that s > t, and let r ∈ R. Then s + r > t + r.\nProof. Let s = [(an)], t = [(bn)], and r = [(cn)]. Since s > t, i.e. s - t > 0, we know that\nthere is an N such that, for n > N, an - bn > 0. So an > bn for n > N. Now, adding cn\nto both sides of this inequality (as we know we can do for rational numbers), we have\nan + cn > bn + cn for n > N, or (an + cn) - (bn + cn) > 0 for n > N. By Definition 17, this\nmeans that s + r = [(an + cn)] > [(bn + cn)] = t + r.\n\nProofs of the other order axioms follow suit.\nSo, we have constructed an ordered field R. In particular, now that we know when a\nreal number is positive, we can define the absolute value of a real number just is we do in\nthe rational case. This means that we can apply Definitions 2 and 3 to sequences of real\nnumbers as well. We will do so in what follows.\nThe thing that really distinguished R from Q is the least upper bound property. To com\nplete our discussion, we must show that this crazy set R of equivalence classes of Cauchy\nsequences really satisfies the least upper bound property! This takes a little work, but\nit is worth doing since the proof we're about to lay out is a prototype for many similar\ntheorems you'll see in years to come.\nBefore getting directly to this proof, let us pause to prove that R is an Archimedean\nfield. Of course, once we've proven that R has the least upper bound property, we will\nknow it's Archimedean by a theorem proved in the first week of class; but we can actually\nuse the Archimedean property to help prove the least upper bound property in this case.\nTheorem 19. R has the Archimedean property.\nProof. Let s, t > 0 be real numbers. We need to find a natural number m so that m s > t.\n·\nFirst, recall that, by m in this context, we mean [(m, m, m, m, . . .)]. So, letting s = [(an)]\nand t = [(bn)], what we need to show is that there exists m with\n[(m, m, m, m, . . .)] [(a1, a2, a3, a4, . . .)] = [(ma1, ma2, ma3, ma4, . . .)] > [(b1, b2, b3, b4, . . .)].\n·\n\nNow, to say that [(man)] > [(bn)], or [(man - bn)] is positive, is, by Definition 17, just to say\nthat there is N such that man - bn > 0 for all n > N. So, what we hope to show is:\nThere exist m, N ∈ N so that man > bn for all n > N.\nTo produce a contradiction, we assume this is not the case; assume that\nfor every m and N, there exists an n > N so that man ≤ bn.\n(∗)\nNow, since (bn) is a Cauchy sequence, by Theorem 5 it is bounded - there is a rational\nnumber M such that bn ≤ M for all n. Now, by the Archimedean property for the rational\nnumbers, given any small rational number ω > 0 there is an m such that M/m < ω/2. Fix\nsuch an m. Then if man ≤ bn, we have an ≤ bn/m ≤ M/m < ω/2.\nNow, (an) is a Cauchy sequence, and so there exists N so that for n, k > N, |an - ak| <\nω/2. By Asumption (∗), we also have an n > N such that man ≤ bn, which means that\nan < ω/2. But then for every k > N, we have that ak - an < ω/2, so ak < an + ω/2 <\nω/2 + ω/2 = . Hence, ak < ω for all k > N. This proves that ak → 0, which (by Definition\n17) contradicts the fact that [(an)] = s > 0.\nIt will be handy to have one more Theorem about how the rationals and reals compare\nbefore we proceed. This theorem is known as the density of Q in R, and it follows almost\nimmediately from the construction or R from Q.\nTheorem 20. Given any real number r, and any small (rational) number ω > 0, there is a rational\nnumber q such that |r - q| < ω.\nProof. The real number r is represented by a Cauchy sequence (a1, a2, a3, . . .). Since this\nsequence is Cauchy, given ω, there is N so that for all m, n > N, |an - am| < ω. Picking\nsome fixed ` > N, we can take the rational number q given by q = [(a`, a`, a`, . . .)]. Then\nwe have r - q = [(an - a`)inf], and q - r = [(a` - an)inf]. Now, since ` > N, we see that\nn=1\nn=1\nfor n > N, an - a` < ω and a` - an < ω, which means (by Definition 17) that r - q < ω and\nq - r < ω; hence, |r - q| < ω.\n\nWe really shouldn't be surprised by this proof; we defined real numbers to be (essen\ntially) approximating sequences of rationals, so we should expect to be able to approxi\nmate reals by rationals!\nAnd now...\nTheorem 21. R has the least upper bound property.\nThe proof of the theorem is fairly complicated, and we will divide it into several smaller\nLemmas. First, Let S ⊂ R be a nonempty subset, and let M be an upper bound for S.\nWe are going to construct two sequences of real numbers, (un) and (`n). First, since S is\nnonempty, there is some element s0 ∈ S. Now, we go through the following inductive\nprocedure to produce numbers u0, u1, u2, . . . and `1, `2, `3, . . .\n- Set u0 = M and `0 = s0.\n- Suppose that we have already defined un and `n. Consider the number mn =\n(un + `n)/2, the average between un and `n.\n- If mn is an upper bound for S, define un+1 = mn and `n+1 = `n.\n- If mn is not an upper bound for S, define un+1 = un and `n+1 = mn.\n\nSince s0 < M, it is easy to prove by induction that (un) is a non-increasing sequence\n(un+1 ≤ un) and (`n) is a non-decreasing sequence (`n+1 ≥ `n). This gives us\nLemma 22. (un) and (`n) are Cauchy sequences of real numbers.\nProof. Note that each `n ≤ M for all n. Since (`n) is non-decreasing, it follows that (`n)\nis Cauchy (this is left for you to show; consider the proof of Theorem 3.14 in [1]). For\n(un), we have un ≥ s0 for all n, and so -un ≤-s0. Since (un) is non-increasing, (-un) is\nnon-decreasing, and so as above, (-un) is Cauchy. It is easy to verify that, therefore, (un)\nis Cauchy.\n\nA Cauchy sequence of rational numbers looks like it must be tending to something, but\nmay not (as discussed above). This doesn't happen in R; in fact, that is the whole point of\nthe construction. To bring this home, the following Lemma shows that (un) does tend to\na real number.\nLemma 23. There is a real number u such that un\nu.\n→\nProof. Fix a term un in the sequence (un). By Theorem 20, there is a rational number qn\nsuch that |un - qn| < 1/n. Consider the sequence (q1, q2, q3, . . .) of rational numbers. We\nwill show this sequence is Cauchy. Fix ω > 0. By the Archimedean property, choose N so\nthat 1/N < ω/3. We know, since (un) is Cauchy, that there is an M such that for n, m > M,\n|un - um| < ω/3. Then, so long as n, m > max{N, M}, we have\nω\nω\nω\n|qn-qm| = |(qn-un)+(un-um)+(um-qm)| ≤|qn-un|+|un-um|+|um-qm| < 3 + 3 + 3 = ω.\nThus, (qn) is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers, and so it represents a real number\nu = [(qn)]. We must show that un - u → 0, but this is practically built into the definition\nof u. To be precise, letting q n be the real number [(qn, qn, qn, . . .)], we see immediately\nthat q n - u\n0 (this is precisely equivalent to the statement that (qn) is Cauchy). But\nun-q n < 1/n\n→\nby construction; the reader may readily verify the assertion that if a sequence\nq n → u and un - q n → 0, then un → u.\n\nSo (un), a non-increasing sequence of upper bounds for S, tends to a real number u. As\nyou've guessed, u is the least upper bound of our set S. To prove this, we need one more\nlemma.\nLemma 24. `n\nu.\n→\nProof. First, note in the first case above, we have that\nun+1 - `n+1 = mn - `n = un + `n - `n = un - `n .\nIn the second case, we also have\nun+1 - `n+1 = un - mn = un - un + `n = un - `n .\nNow, this means that u1 - `1 = 1 (M - s), and so u2 - `2 = 1 (u1 - `1) = (1 )2(L - s), and\nin general (as you can easily prove by induction), un - `n = 2-n(L - s). Since L > s so\nL-s > 0, and since 2-n < 1/n, by the Archimedean property for R, we have for any ω > 0\nthat 2-n(L - s) < ω for all sufficiently large n. Thus, un - `n < 2-n(L - s) < ω as well,\nand so un - `n\n0. Again, the reader should verify that, since un\nu, we have `n\nu\nas well.\n→\n→\n→\n\nProof of Theorem 21. First, we show that u is an upper bound. Well, suppose it is not, so\nthat u < s for some s ∈ S. Then ω ≡ s - u is > 0, and since un → u and is non-increasing,\nthere must be an n so that un - u < ω, meaning that un < u + ω = u + (s - u) = s. Since\nun is an upper bound for S, however, this is a contradiction. Hence, u is an upper bound\nfor S.\nNow, we also know that, for each n, `n is not an upper bound, meaning that for each n,\nthere is an sn ∈ S so that `n ≤ sn. Lemma 24 tells us that `n → u, and since the sequence\n(`n) is non-decreasing, this means that for each ω > 0, there is an N so that for n > N,\n`n > u - ω. Hence, for n > N, sn ≥ `n > u - ω as well. In particular, for each ω > 0, there\nis an element s ∈ S such that s > u - ω. This means that no number smaller than u can be\nan upper bound for S. Hence, u is the least upper bound for S: sup s exists. Hurrah!\n\nThis concludes our construction of these unreal R eal numbers. Remember: they are\nonly real (in the vernacular sense) inasumch as they are well-approximated by rational\nnumbers. In any case, we can now rest assured that the declaration of Theorem 1.19 in [1]\n(the existence of the real numbers) is valid; there really does exist (abstractly) an ordered-\nfield with the least upper bound property.

      "content": "The Devil's Staircase\nRecall the usual construction of the Cantor set: C0 = [0, 1], C1 = [0, 1 ] ∪ [2 , 1], and in\ngeneral Cn is a disjoint union of 2n closed intervals, each of length 3-n, constructed from\nCn-1 by deleting the open-middle-third of each of the 2n-1 intervals constituting Cn-1.\nThen the total length of the intervals in Cn is ( 2 )n . The Cantor set C is the intersection\nT\nC =\nn≥0 Cn.\nSet gn = (3\n2 )n1Cn ; that is,\n(\n,\ngn(x) =\n(3\n2 )n\nx ∈ Cn .\n0,\nx /∈ Cn\nThe function gn is discontinuous only at the 2n+1 points at the boundaries of the intervals\nmaking up Cn. This is a finite set, and so gn is Riemann integrable. So we may define\nfn : [0, 1]\nR as follows:\n→\nZ x\nfn(x) =\ngn(t) dt.\nFrom the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we know that the functions fn are Lipschitz\nR 1\ncontinuous. Note also that fn(0) = 0, while fn(1) =\n0 gn(t) dt. This integral can be\ncalculated as\nZ 1\nR 1\ngn(t) dt = (2\n3 )n\n0 1Cn (t) dt = (2\n3 )n length(Cn) = 1.\n·\nSo fn is a continuous function with fn(0) = 0 and fn(1) = 1 for each n. Notice that fn is\nconstant on [0, 1] - Cn, and is linear with slope (2 )n on the intervals making up Cn. So fn\nis monotone increasing. Here is the graph of f2.\nFIGURE 1. The graph of f2.\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\nLet I be any one of the 2n closed intervals that make up Cn. Then gn(x) = (3\n2 )n for all\nx ∈ I, while gn+1(x) is equal to (3 )n+1 = 3 gn(x) for x in the first third or last third of I, and\nequal to 0 in the middle interval. It follows that\ngn(t) dt =\ngn+1(t) dt = 2-n .\n(∗)\nI\nI\nNote also that gn(x) = gn+1(x) for x /∈ Cn. Hence, if a is any endpoint of an interval in Cn,\na\na\ngn(t) dt =\ngn+1(t) dt.\n(∗∗)\nIt follows by integrating (∗) that\nfn+1(x) = fn(x),\nx /∈ Cn.\n(∗∗∗)\nNow, the Cantor set C is closed, and so any point x\ninterval in Cc\nS\n∈/ C is contained in a small open\nfor all n ≥ N,\n. Therefore there is some N ∈ N such that x ∈ Cc\n(x) = fN (x) for all n ≥ N. This shows that the sequence of\n(x) converges pointwise on Cc. But it's even better than that.\n=\nCc\nn\nn≥0\nand by the above we have fn\nn\nfunctions fn\nLet x ∈ Cn, and let I = [a, b] be the interval in Cn containing x. Applying (∗∗), we have\n(t) - gn+1(t)] dt\n≤\na\n|gn(t) - gn+1(t)| dt\nZ b\n≤\na\n|gn(t) - gn+1(t)| dt.\nAgain, we have |gn(t) - gn+1(t)| = (3 )n+1 - (3 )n on the first and last third of [a, b], while it\nequals (3\n2 )n on the middle third. The difference is therefore bounded above by (3\n2 )n+1 on\nthe interval which has length 3-n, and so the above integral is bounded by 3-n(3\n2 )n+1; that\nis, we have proved that\n|fn(x) - fn+1(x)| ≤ 2 · 2-n < 2-n+1 ,\nx ∈ Cn.\nCombining this with (∗∗∗), we have |fn(x) - fn+1(x)| < 2-n+1 for all x. It follows that the\nsequence {fn} is uniformly Cauchy, and therefore converges uniformly to a limit function\nf. The functions fn are continuous, and so the uniform limit function f is continuous.\nAlso, for x ∈/ Cn the sequence {fk(x)}inf\nk=n is constant, and therefore fn(x) = f(x). But fn\nis constant on Cn\nc . Finally, since fn(0) = 0 and fn(1) = 1 for all n, we have f(0) = 0 and\nf(1) = 1. We have therefore proved the following:\nfn → f uniformly, where f is continuous, f 0(x) = 0 for x ∈ Cc, and f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1.\nA little additional thought shows that the limit function f is monotone increasing. It\nis called the Cantor Function or the Devil's staircase. Its graph is shown in Figure 2. It\ncan actually be described in simple terms. Here is an algorithm for calculating f(x) for\nx ∈ [0, 1].\n- Express x in base 3, [x]3.

Otherwise, if\n[x]3 contains no 1s (i.e. x ∈ C), then T (x) = x.\n- Since T (x) is an even ternary number (i.e. in C), we can relabel all 2s as 1s. The 0-1\nstring that remains, re-interpretted in base 2, is f(x).\nFor example, 1/4 in base 2 is 0.0202020 . . . (isn't that surprising? 1/4 ∈ C!). Hence,\nf[(1/4)]2 = 0.01010101 . . . = 1/3. On the other hand, [1/5]3 = 0.012101210 . . ., hence\n[T (1/5)]3 = 0.02, and so [f(1/5)]2 = 0.01, which is 1/4 in base 2; hence, f(1/5) = 1/4.\nIn general, a non-constant monotone increasing function that is continuous, differentiable\nalmost everywhere with derivative 0, is called singular. These functions really point out\nthe necessity of the continuity (and definition everywhere) of the derivative of f in order\nfor the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to make sense. (After all, the derivative of f is\n0 almost everywhere, and so\nf 0 =6\nf in this case.)\nFor other fun examples of singular functions, lookup the Wikipedia entries on Minkowski's\nquestion mark function, and Kolmogorov's circle map.\nOne final note: for those who are physically inclined, the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was\nawarded for the discovery and explanation of what is known as the fractional quantum\nHall effect. This phenomenon is a physical manifestation of a singular function.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.100B Analysis I\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

For convenience, we will work with the case p < inf,\nas the case p = inf requires slightly different language (although the same ideas apply).\nSuppose that a1 , a2 , a3 , . . . is a Cauchy sequence in `p.

Hence, we\ncan estimate the initial-segment of N terms of a as follows:\nan = (an - a kN ) + a kN ,\nn\nn\nand so\nX\nN\n!1/p\nN\n!1/p\nN\n!1/p\n|an|p\n≤\n|an - a kN |p\n+\n|a k\nn\nN |p\n.\n(2)\nn\nn=1\nn=1\nn=1\nNow, the last term in Equation 2 is bounded by the actual `p-norm of the whole sequence\nakN ; that is, we can tack on the infinitely many more terms,\n\n!1/p\n\n!1/p\nN\nX\nX\ninf\n|an\nkN |p\n≤\n|an\nkN |p\n= ka kN kp.\nn=1\nn=1\nRecall that (ak)inf\nk=1 is a Cauchy sequence in the metric space `p. We have proved that any\nCauchy sequence in a metric space is bounded. Thus, there is a constant R independent of\nN such that kakN kp ≤ R. Combining this with Equation 1, we can therefore estimate the\nright-hand-side of Equation 2 by\nN\n!1/p\nN\n!1/p\nX\nX\n1/p\n|an|p\n≤\n(2-N )p\n+ R = N 2-Np\n+ R.\nn=1\nn=1\n\nX\nP\nP\nX\nX\nX\nFinally, the term N 2-Np 1/p = N 1/p2-N converges to 0 as N →inf (remember your\ncalculus!), and hence this sequence is also bounded by some constant S. In total, then,\nwe have\n\n!1/p\nN\n|an|p\n≤ R + S for all N ∈ N.\nn=1\nPN\np\nIn other words,\nn=1 |an| ≤ (R + S)p. The constant on the right does not depend on N;\nit is an upper bound for the increasing sequence of partial sums of the series\ninf\nn=1 an\n=\nkakp\np. Thus, we have kakp ≤ R + S, and so a ∈ `p.\n|\n|p\n\nSo, we have shown that the putative limit a (the point-wise limit of the sequence (ak)inf\nk=1\nof points in `p) is actually an element of the metric space `p. But we have yet to show that\nit is the limit of the sequence (ak) in `p. That somewhat involved proof now follows.\nProposition 2. Let (ak)inf\nk=1 be a Cauchy sequence in `p, and let a be its point-wise limit (which is\nin `p, by Lemma 1). Then kak - akp → 0 as k →inf.\nProof. Let > 0. Lemma 1 shows that a ∈ `p, which means that\ninf\n< inf. Hence,\nby the Cauchy criterion, there is an N1 ∈ N so that\nn=1 |an|p\ninf\n|an|p < p.\nn=N1\nIn addition, we know that (ak)inf\nis `p-Cauchy, so there is N2 so that, whenever k, m ≥ N2,\nk=1\nkak - amkp < . Letting N = max{N1, N2}, we therefore have\ninf\n|an|p < p and ka N - a kkp < ∀k ≥ N.\n(3)\nn=N\nNow, the sequence aN is in `p, and so we can apply the Cauchy criterion again: select N 0\nlarge enough so that\ninf\n|a N |p < p.\n(4)\nn\nn=N0\nNote, we can always increase N 0 and still maintain this estimate, so we are free to chose\nN 0 ≥ N.\nWe now use the constant N 0 we defined above in the bounds we will need later. Since\nak\nan for each fixed n, we can choose K1 so that ak\n< p/N 0 for k ≥ K1. Likewise,\nn →\nk\n| 1 - a1|\nwe can choose K2 so that |a2 - a2| < p/N 0 for k ≥ K2. Continuing this way for N 0 steps,\nwe can take K = max{K1, K2, . . . , KN0 } and then we have\np\n|a k\nn - an| < N 0 , for k ≥ K and n ≤ N 0.\n(5)\nFor good measure, we will also (increasing it if necessary) make sure that K ≥ N 0. Now,\nfor any k ≥ K, break up b = ak - a as follows:\n(bn)inf\nn=1 = (bn)N0-1 + (bn)inf\nn=1\nn=N0 .\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n(To be a little more pedantic, we are expressing bn = xn + yn where xn = bn when n < N 0\nand = 0 when n ≥ N 0, and yn = 0 when n < N 0 and = bn when n ≥ N 0.) The triangle\ninequality for the p-norm then gives\nNX\n0-1\n!1/p\nX\n!1/p\ninf\nka k - akp ≤\n|an\nk - an|p\n+\n|an\nk - an|p\n.\n(6)\nn=1\nn=N0\nEquation 5 shows that, for k ≥ K, the first term here is\nNX\n0-1\n!1/p\nN0-1\n!1/p\n\n1/p\nk\np\nX p\nN 0 - 1\n|an - an|\n≤\nN 0\n=\nN 0\n< .\nn=1\nn=1\nFor the second term in Equation 6, we use the triangle inequality for the `p-norm restricted\nto the range n ≥ N 0 to get\n\n!1/p\n\n!1/p\n\n!1/p\ninf\ninf\ninf\n|an\nk - an|p\n≤\n|an\nk |p\n+\n|an|p\n.\nn=N0\nn=N0\nn=N0\nSince N 0 ≥ N, Equation 3 shows that the second term here is < . So, summing up the\nlast two estimates, we have\n\n!1/p\ninf\nka k - akp ≤ 2 +\n|a k\nn|p\n,\n(7)\nn=N0\nwhenever k ≥ K. So we need only show this final term is small. Here we make one more\ndecomposition: ak\nn = ak\nn - aN\nn + aN\nn , and so once again applying the triangle inequality,\n\n!1/p\n\n!1/p\n\n!1/p\nX\ninf\ninf\ninf\nk p\nk\nN p\nN p\n|an|\n≤\n|an - an |\n+\n|a |\n.\nn\nn=N0\nn=N0\nn=N0\nThe first of these terms is a sum of non-negative terms over n ≥ N 0, and so it is bounded\nabove by the sum over n ≥ 1 which is equal to kak - aN kp, which is < by Equation 3\n(since k ≥ K ≥ N 0 ≥ N). And the second term is also < , by Equation 4. Whence, the\nlast term in Equation 7 is also < 2, and so we have shown that\n∀ > 0, ∃K ∈ N such that ∀k ≥ K ka k - akp < 4.\nOf course, we should have been more clever and chosen all our constants in terms of /4\nto get a clean in the end, but such tidying is not really necessary; 4 is also arbitrarily\nsmall, and so we have shown that (ak)inf\nk=1 does converge to a in `p. This concludes the\nproof that `p is complete. Whew!\n\nLet us conclude by remarking that a very similar (though somewhat simpler) proof\nworks for p = inf; the details are left to the reader.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.100B Analysis I\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

We say that Δ has measure 0 if, for each o > 0, there\nis a sequence of balls (Bj = Brj (cj)))j∈N with radii rj > 0 (and centres cj ∈ R), such that\nΔ ⊂ S\nj∈N Bj and Pinf\nj=1 rj < o.\ninf\nThe balls here are open intervals of lenght 2rj, so the series\nj=1 2rj < 2o is the sum\nof lengths. However, the balls could intersect each other, so 2o is just an upper bound\nS\nfor the \"total length\" or \"volume\" (what we will call \"measure\") of their union\nj Bj.\nA full definition of \"measures\" is beyond the scope of this course; the only important\nproperty that we will use here is that subsets have smaller measure than the set that they\nare contained in (assuming both are \"measurable\"). So the above Definition just says that\nthe measure of Δ is smaller than 2o for any o > 0. So - if the measure of Δ is to be a\nnonnegative real number - the measure of Δ will indeed be 0.\nExamples of measure 0 subsets of R are all finite and countable subsets (see Lemma\nbelow) as well as the (uncountable) Cantor set.\nLemma 2. Let Δ ⊂ R be a countable subset, then Δ has measure 0.\nProof. By assumption, we can enumerate Δ = {cj | j ∈ N}. Now for any o > 0 choose the\nsequence of radii rj = 2-j-1o, then clearly S\nj∈N Brj (cj) contains Δ (since it contains every\ninf\ninf 2-k o\no\ncj ∈ Δ as centre of a ball) and we have\nj=1 rj =\nk=0\n4 = 2 < o.\nGiven a function f : [a, b] → R, we say it is continuous almost everywhere if the set Δf ⊂\n[a, b] of discontinuities of f has measure 0. If the set of discontinuities is finite or countable,\nthen f is continuous almost everywhere, for example. So the function f(x) = 1/x for x = 0\nand 0 for x = 0 is continuous almost everywhere. However, this function is not Riemann\nintegrable (on [-1, 1] say). Indeed, Riemann integrable functions must be bounded. But\nthis is the only restriction, it turns out.\nTheorem 3. Let -inf < a < b < inf, and let f : [a, b] → R be a bounded function. Then f is\nRiemann integrable iff it is continuous almost everywhere.\nHere, we will only prove the reverse direction:\nProposition 4. Let f : [a, b] → R be bounded and continuous almost everywhere. Then f is\nRiemann integrable.\nThe converse is no harder (in fact, in some ways it is easier), but it requires a somewhat\ndifferent approach to the integral than Rudin takes.\nIn order to prove that f is Riemann integrable we need to find partitions (xi)i=0,...,N\nsuch that the difference of upper and lower approximation becomes small:\nN\nU(f, (xi)) -L(f, (xi)) =\n(xi -xi-1)\nsup\nf(x) -\ninf\nf(x)\n.\n(1)\ni=1\nx∈[xi-1,xi]\nx∈[xi-1,xi]\n\nP\nP\nThis is a sum over the oscillations of the function (i.e. the maximal difference of function\nvalues on each interval [xi-1, xi]), weighted with the length of the intervals. We will use\noscillations throughout the proof, so let us introduce that notation. For any subset B ⊂ R\nwe write\noscf(B) = sup f(x) - inf f(x).\nx∈B\nx∈B\nWith this notation we simply have U(f, (xi)) -L(f, (xi)) = PN\ni=1(xi -xi-1)oscf([xi-1, xi]).\nNow the basic idea is to show that continuity almost everywhere means that large oscilla\ntions of the function only happen on very small sets, and then control those appropriately,\nso that the sum in (1) becomes small.\nTo embark on a precise proof of the Proposition, we fix o > 0, and let Bj = Brj (cj) be\nPinf\nballs as in the definition of measure 0, which cover Δf and have small measure 2\nj=1 rj <\n2o. We then pick out those balls on which f has large oscillation: Let\nS\nJ :=\nj ∈ N oscf(Bj) > o\nand\nVo :=\nj∈JBj\nbe the index set and the union of just those balls. Note that the total length of Vo cannot\nbe larger than that of all balls Bj, that is (since all these sequences of nonnegative terms\nconverge) 2\nj∈J rj ≤ 2\nj∈N rj < 2o.\nNow we will try to find a partition such that each interval has either small oscillation\nor is contained in Vo (which has small total length). We restrict ourselves to equidistant\npartitions (xi = a + (b - a) i )i=0,...N into intervals [xi-1, xi] of length b-a . The key to\nN\nN\nthe proof is the next Lemma, which says exactly that a sufficiently fine partition (with\nlarge N ∈ N) satisfies our requirements (every interval has small oscillation or is entirely\ncontained in Vo).\nLemma 5. There exists N ∈ N so that, for any i ∈{1, . . . , N}, if oscf([xi-1, xi]) > o then\n[xi-1, xi] ⊂ Vo.\nProof. We argue by contradiction. If this Lemma is false, then for every N ∈ N we can find\ni ∈{1, . . ., N} such that oscf([xi-1, xi]) > o but [xi-1, xi] ∩Vo\nc =\n∅. Hence, for every N ∈ N\nwe find sN, tN, zN ∈ [xi-1, xi] (for some i) such that oscf([xi-1, xi]) ≥ f(sN) - f(tN) > o\nand zN ∈ Vo\nc . The sequence (sN)N∈N is bounded (it lies in [a, b]), so it has a convergent\nb-a\nsubsequence limk→inf sNk = y ∈ [a, b]. Since the points tN and zN have distance at most\nN\nfrom sN, they all converge (for the same subsequence (Nk)k∈N) to the same limit y. The\nfunction f is discontinuous at the limit y since f(sNk ) -f(tNk ) > o does not converge to\n0. So we have y ∈ Δf, and hence y ∈ Bj for some j ∈ N. On the other hand, (zNk )k∈N is\na sequence in Vo\nc. Here Vo is a union of open balls, hence open, and so its complement Vo\nc\nis closed, hence contains the limit y = limk→inf zNk . So y /∈ Vo cannot be contained in any\nball Bj of large oscillation, and hence y ∈ Bj for some ball with oscf(Bj) ≤ o. However,\nthe ball Bj is open and thus will contain sNk and tNk for all sufficiently large k ∈ N. This\nleads to the contradiction\no < f(sNk ) -f(tNk ) ≤ oscf(Bj) ≤ o.\nAnd this - magically - proves the Lemma.\n\nX\nX\nProof of Proposition: To prove that f is integrable, let any o′ > 0 be given, then we need to\nfind a partition P with U(f, P) - L(f, P) < o′ . We will do this by following our above\nS\nconstuction, starting from a covering\nj∈N Bj of Δf with total length < 2o for some o > 0\nthat we are free to choose. It will turn out that o = o′ ((b-a)+2oscf([a, b]))-1 is a wise choice,\nwhere oscf([a, b]) = sup f -inf f, the total oscillation of f, is finite since f is bounded.\nNow Lemma 5 provides an N ∈ N such that the partition P = (xi = a+(b-a) N\ni )i=0,...,N\nhas the following crucial property: Every interval [xi-1, xi] satisfies at least one of the\nproperties oscf([xi-1, xi]) ≤ o or [xi-1, xi] ⊂ Vo (and any interval satisfies oscf([xi-1, xi]) ≤\noscf([a, b])). With that we can estimate\nN\nb-a\nU(f, P) -L(f, P) =\nN oscf([xi-1, xi])\ni=1\nN\nb-a\nK b-a\n≤\nN o +\nN oscf([a, b]),\ni=1\nwhere K is the number of i ∈{1, . . ., N} such that [xi-1, xi] ⊂ Vo. The total length (\"mea\nsure\") of all these intervals adds up to K b-a . On the other hand, these intervals have\nN\noverlaps at most in some endpoints, and their union is contained in Vo. Hence their mea\nsure should be bounded by that of Vo. This is the point where we invoke measure theory\nto deduce K b-a < 2o. Once we have that, we easily obtain\nN\nU(f, P) -L(f, P) < (b -a)o + 2o oscf([a, b]) = o ′ .\nThat was exactly what we needed to show for any given o′ > 0. So it follows by Theorem\n6.6 in Rudin that f is Riemann integrable.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n18.100B Analysis I\nFall 2010\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "X\nP |\n|\nTHE WEIERSTRASS PATHOLOGICAL FUNCTION\nUntil Weierstrass published his shocking paper in 1872, most of the mathematical world\n(including luminaries like Gauss) believed that a continuous function could only fail to\nbe differentiable at some collection of isolated points. In fact, it turns out that \"most\"\ncontinuous functions are non-differentiable at all points. (To understand what this state\nment could mean, you should take courses in topology and measure theory.) However,\nWeierstrass was not, in fact, the first to construct such a pathological function. He was\npreceded by Bolzano (in 1830), Cell'erier (also 1830), and Riemann (1862). None of the\nothers published their work (indeed, their examples were not discovered in their notes\nuntil after their deaths).\nAll known examples of non-differentiable continuous functions are constructed in a\nsimilar fashion to the following example - they are limits of functions that oscillate more\nand more on small scales, but with higher-frequency oscillations being damped quickly.\nThe example we give here is a faithful reproduction of Weierstrass's original 1872 proof.\nIt is somewhat more complicated than the example given as Theorem 7.18 in Rudin, but\nis superior in at least one important way, as explained in Remark 2.\nTheorem 1. Let 0 < a < 1, and choose a positive odd integer b large enough that ab\nπ\n-1 < 3\n2 (i.e.\nab > 1 + 3\nπ ). For example, take a = 1\n2 and b = 11. Define the function W : R → R by\ninf\nW (x) =\na n cos(bnπx).\nn=0\nThen W is uniformly continuous on R, but is differentiable at no point.\nPN\nRemark 2. Notice that the partial sums WN (x) =\nn=0 an cos(bnπx) are all Cinf functions.\nAs the following proof shows, these partial sums converge uniformly to W , and so we\nhave an example here of a sequence of Cinf functions that converge uniformly to a nowhere-\ndifferentiable function. This is the most dramatic demonstration that differentiability is\nnot preserved under uniform convergence! The example of Theorem 7.18 in Rudin, while\nsimilar in spirit, constructs a function as a uniformly convergent series of functions that\nhave sharp cusps on ever-denser sets, not achieving the same demonstration. Indeed,\nfrom Rudin's proof one might be left with the impression that the construction depends\nfundamentally on the non-smooth points in the approximating functions. As the proof\nbelow shows, this has nothing to do with the reason the limit function is non-smooth. The\nreal reason is oscillation on small scales, and this can be achieved with smooth oscillations\nof high frequency.\nProof. First note that, since cos(bnπx) ≤ 1 for all x, we have the terms in the summation\nare bounded by an, and\nn an is absolutely convergent. Therefore, by the Weierstrass M-\ntest (Theorem 7.10 in Rudin), the sum W (x) converges uniformly. Since the partial sums\nare all Cinf (as explained in Remark 2), they are continuous, and so their uniform limit W\nis continuous on R by Theorem 7.12 in Rudin.\nWe will now show that, at any arbitrary point x0 ∈ R, W is not differentiable at x0. The\nstrategy is as follows: we construct two sequences (x+ ) and (x-), such that x+\nx0 from\nm\nm\nm →\n\nthe right and xm\n-\nx0 from the left, and such that the different quotients\n→\nW (xm) - W (x0)\nm - x0\n±\n±\n±\nm\nD W =\nx\ndo not have the same limit. In fact, we will show that\ndiverges to inf as m →inf,\nand that the two have opposite signs. So on small scales, f oscillates infinitely-often with\n±\nm\nD W\n|\n|\ninfinite slope! Figure 1 pictures this function.\nFIGURE 1. The graph of the Weiestrass function W .\nFix x0 ∈ R. For each m ∈ N, we can choose an integer αm ∈ Z such that\nbm x0 = αm + m\nwhere m ∈ [-2\n1 , 2\n1 ). (αm is either bbmx0c or bbmx0c - 1, depending whether the fractional\npart of bmx0 is ≤ 1 or > 1 .) Now, define\n±\nxm\nαm ± 1\nbmx0 - m ± 1 = x0 + ±1 - m\n=\n≡\nbm\nbm\nbm\n.\nSince\n±\n±\n±\ninf\n±\n±\n±\n≤ 2, and b ≥ 3, we see that xm - x0 converges to 0. Notice also from the\n< x0 < x+ . We now examine the difference quotients,\nW (x ) - W (x0)\nX\ncos(bnπx ) - cos(bnπx0)\nm\nm\nm\nm - x0\nm - x0\n-\n| ± 1 - m\nsigns that xm\n|\nm\nn\nD W =\n=\na\n.\nx\nx\nn=0\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n(We can subtract the sums because they converge, by the limit theorems.)

By the mean value theorem, there is a point\nA-B\nC between A and B where cos(A)-cos(B) = - sin C, and the absolute value is therefore ≤ 1.\nHence, we have\nA-B\nm-1\n(ab)m - 1\n(ab)m\n|S1\n±| ≤\n(ab)nπ = π ab - 1\n< π ab - 1 .\n(1)\nn=0\nTurning now to the second term, we reindex k = n - m,\nS± =\ninf\na\ncos(bk+mπx±) - cos(bk+mπx0) .\n(2)\nk+m\nm\nx±\nm - x0\nk=0\nThe argument of cos in the first term is\ncos(bk+mπx±) = cos bkπ bm αm ± 1\n= cos\n\nbk(αm ± 1)π\n\n.\nm\n·\nbm\nSince bk is an odd integer and α ± 1 is an integer, this number is ±1, with the sign deter\nmined by the parity of αm ± 1; that is,\ncos(bk+mπx±) = (-1)αm±1 = -(-1)αm .\nm\nThe argument of cos in the second term in Equation 2 is\nbk+mπx0 = bk+mπαm + m = bkπ(αm + m).\nbm\nWe now use that summation formula for cosine, cos(A+B) = cos(A) cos(B)-sin(A) sin(B),\nso that\ncos(bk+mπx0) = cos(bkαmπ) cos(bkmπ) - sin(bkαmπ) sin(bkmπ).\nSince bkαm ∈ Z, the second term is 0. Also, we have cos(bkαmπ) = (-1)αm . So\ncos(bk+mπx0) = (-1)α cos(bkmπ).\nm\nCombining this with Equation 2, we have\nS2\n± =\ninf\na k+m -(-1)αm - (-1)αm cos(bkmπ) .\n(3)\nx±\nm - x0\nk=0\nUsing the fact that x±\n)/bm, we can now simplify Equation 3 to read\nm - x0 = (±1 - m\ninf\nk 1 + cos(bkmπ)\nS± = (ab)m(-1)αm\na\nm 1\n.\n(4)\nk=0\n\nX\nX\n\nWe now consider the two sums, S +\nseparately.
