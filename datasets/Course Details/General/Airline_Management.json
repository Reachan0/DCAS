FLEET PLANNING\n- Long-term strategic decision for an airline:\n- Affects financial position, operating costs, and especially the\nability to serve specific routes.\n- Huge capital investment with lasting impacts:\n- US $40-60 million for narrow-body aircraft\n- $200+ million for wide-body long-range 747-400\n- Depreciation impacts last 10-15 years\n- Some aircraft have been operated economically for 30+ years\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nFleet Planning Decisions\n- Fleet planning is an optimal staging problem:\n- Number and type of aircraft required\n- Timing of deliveries and retirement of existing fleet\n- Tremendous uncertainty about future conditions\n- Aircraft evaluation criteria for airlines include:\n- Technical and performance characteristics\n- Economics of operations and revenue generation\n- Marketing and environmental issues\n- Political and international trade concerns\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\n2. ROUTE PLANNING\n- Given a fleet, selection of routes to be flown\n- Economic considerations dominate :\n- Forecasts of potential demand and revenues\n- Airline's market share of total forecast demand\n- Opportunity cost of using aircraft on this route\n- Network implications for costs, revenues and \"profit\"\n-\nPractical considerations just as important:\n- Aircraft with adequate range and proper capacity\n- Performance and operating cost characteristics\n- Operational constraints and aircraft/crew rotation issues\n- Regulations, bilaterals, and limited airport slots\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\n\"Route Profitability Models\"\n- OR models designed to perform such route\nevaluations, used by some airlines:\n- Demand, cost and revenue forecasts for specific route, perhaps\nfor multiple years into the future\n- Select routes to maximize profits, given set of candidate routes\nand estimated demands\n- Subject to fleet and capacity constraints\n- Assessments should be based on total network impacts\n- Built on highly simplified assumptions:\n- Profit estimates entirely dependent on accuracy of demand\nestimates and market share models\n- Ability to integrate competitive effects is limited\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\n3. SCHEDULE DEVELOPMENT\n- Involves several interrelated decisions, which\nto date have not been fully integrated:\nFrequency Planning: Number of departures to be offered on each\nroute, non-stop versus multi-stop\nTimetable Development: Flight departure and arrival times,\nincluding connections at airline hubs\nFleet Assignment: Aircraft type for each flight, based on demand\nand operating cost estimates\nAircraft Rotation Planning: Links consecutive flights to ensure\nbalanced aircraft flows on the network.\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nOR Models in Airline Scheduling\n- Airline scheduling problems have received\nmost operations research (OR) attention\n- Use of schedule optimization models has led\nto impressive profit gains in:\n- Aircraft rotations; fleet assignment\n- Crew rotations; maintenance scheduling\n- Current focus is on \"solving\" larger problems:\n- Timetable optimization is still not feasible--too many dimensions\nand constraints\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\n4. PRICING DECISIONS\n- \"Differential pricing\" by airlines is universal:\n- Classes of service (First, Business, Coach)\n- Different \"fare products\" within the coach cabin, with different\nrestrictions, at different prices\n- Virtually every airline in the world offers multiple price points\n(even low-fare carriers with \"simplified\" fare structures)\n- Economic trade-off in pricing decisions:\n- Stimulation of new demand; increased market share for airline\n- Diversion of existing demand to lower fares; reduced revenues\n- Recent pricing difficulties of network airlines due in part to greater\ndiversion of revenues than stimulation of demand\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nPricing Models\n- Pricing theory has not kept pace with airline\ncompetitive pricing practices\n- Difficult to estimate price elasticity, willingness to pay, potential for\nstimulation and diversion\n- No practical tools for airlines to determine \"optimal\" prices\n- Some airlines are now implementing \"Pricing\nDecision Support Systems\"\n- Primarily monitoring of price changes\n- Little competitive modeling of pricing impacts\n- Dominant practice is to match low fares to fill\nplanes and retain market share.\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\n5. REVENUE MANAGEMENT\n- \"Inventory control\" for airlines:\n- Given a scheduled flight, capacity and prices, how many bookings\nto accept by fare type\n- Objective is to maximize revenue -- fill each seat with highest\npossible revenue\n- Computerized RM systems used by airlines to\nincrease revenues by 4-6%:\n- Generate forecasts by flight date and fare class\n- Optimize seat allocations to different fare classes\n- Overbooking models to minimize costs of denied boardings and\n\"spoilage\"\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nExample of Third Generation RM System\nREVENUE\nDATA\nACTUAL\nBOOKINGS\nHISTORICAL\nBOOKING DATA\nOVERBOOKING\nMODEL\nNO-SHOW\nDATA\nFORECASTING\nMODEL\nRECOMMENDED\nBOOKING LIMITS\nOPTIMIZATION\nMODEL\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nIntegrated Airline Planning Models\n- As described, current practice is to perform\nscheduling, pricing and RM sequentially.\n- Integrated models would jointly optimize\nschedules, capacity, prices, and seat\ninventories:\n- Better feedback from pricing and RM systems can affect optimal\nchoice of schedule and aircraft\n- Better choice of schedule and capacity can reduce need for\nexcessive discounting and \"fare wars\"\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nThe Ultimate Challenge\n- Joint optimization and planning is a big\nchallenge, both theoretically and practically:\n- Few airlines have \"corporate databases\" with consistent and\ndetailed demand/cost data\n- Research is still required to identify models that can capture\ndynamics and competitive behaviors\n- Organizational coordination within airlines and willingness to\naccept large-scale decision tool\n- Might never be possible to integrate all subtleties of airline\nplanning decisions into a useful tool"

Basic Airline Profit Model\nOperating Profit = Revenues - Operating Expense\nOperating Profit = RPM x Yield - ASM x Unit Cost\n- The use of individual terms in this profit equation to\nmeasure airline success can be misleading:\n- High Yield is not desirable if ALF is too low; in general, Yield is a\npoor indicator of airline profitability\n- Low Unit Cost is of little value if Revenues are weak\n- Even ALF on its own tells us little about profitability, as high ALF\ncould be the result of extremely low fares (yields)\n- Airline profit maximizing strategy is to increase\nrevenues, decrease costs, but the above terms are\ninterrelated.\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nYield vs. Distance -- Top 50 O+D Markets\nO-D Market Distance (miles)\nYield (cents/RPM)\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nAdditional Airline Measures\n- Average Stage Length\n- Average non-stop flight distance\n- Aircraft Miles Flown / Aircraft Departures\n- Longer average stage lengths associated with lower yields and\nlower unit costs (in theory)\n- Average Passenger Trip Length\n- Average distance flown from origin to destination\n- Revenue Passenger Miles (RPMS) / Passengers\n- Typically greater than average stage length, since some proportion\nof passengers will take more than one flight (connections)\n- Average Number of Seats per Flight Departure\n- Available Seat Miles / Aircraft Miles Flown\n- Higher average seats per flight associated with lower unit costs (in\ntheory)\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\n2. Air Travel Markets\n- City-pair market\n- Demand for air travel between Boston and Chicago\n- Airport-pair market\n- City-pair demand disaggregated to different airports BOS-O'Hare\nand BOS-Midway\n- Parallel air travel markets\n- Region-pair market\n- Demand between entire Boston metropolitan area and Chicago\nmetropolitan area\n- Additional parallel airport-pair markets including Providence and\nManchester to O'Hare and Midway\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nDistinct and Separate O-D Markets\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nOrigin-Destination Market Demand\n- Air travel demand is defined for an origin-destination\nmarket, not a flight leg in an airline network:\n- Number of persons wishing to travel from origin A to destination B\nduring a given time period (e.g., per day)\n- Includes both passengers starting their trip at A and those\ncompleting their travel by returning home to B (opposite markets)\n- Typically, volume of travel measured in one-way passenger trips\nbetween A and B, perhaps summed over both directions\n- Airline networks create complications for analysis of\nmarket demand and supply:\n- Not all A-B passengers will fly on non-stop flights from A to B, as\nsome will choose one-stop or connecting paths\n- Any single non-stop flight leg A-B can also serves many other O-D\nmarkets, as part of connecting or multi-stop paths\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nJoint Supply to O-D Markets\nAverage Bookings\nIAH\nMEX\nLAS\nHNL\nPHX\nMSY\nCUN\nPVR\nACA\nSAN\nSJD\nSNA\nSAT\nAUS\nABQ\nTUS\nSFO\nDFW\nBZE\nCZM\nLAX\nZIH\nGUM\nBOS-IAH Flight\nTop O-D Markets By Volume\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nDichotomy of Demand and Supply\n- Inherent inability to directly compare demand and\nsupply at the \"market\" level\n- Demand is generated by O-D market, while supply is\nprovided as a set of flight leg departures over a\nnetwork of operations\n- One flight leg provides joint supply of seats to many\nO-D markets\n- Number of seats on the flight is not the \"supply\" to a single market\n- Not possible (or realistic) to determine supply of seats to each O-D\n- Single O-D market served by many competing airline\npaths\n- Tabulation of total O-D market traffic requires detailed ticket coupon\nanalysis\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nImplications for Analysis\n- Dichotomy of airline demand and supply complicates\nmany facets of airline economic analysis\n- Difficult, in theory, to answer seemingly \"simple\"\neconomic questions, for example:\n- Because we cannot quantify \"supply\" to an individual O-D market,\nwe cannot determine if the market is in \"equilibrium\"\n- Cannot determine if the airline's service to that O-D market is\n\"profitable\", or whether fares are \"too high\" or \"too low\"\n- Serious difficulties in proving predatory pricing against low-fare\nnew entrants, given joint supply of seats to multiple O-D markets\nand inability to isolate costs of serving each O-D market\n- In practice, assumptions about cost and revenue\nallocation are required:\n- Estimates of flight and/or route profitability are open to question\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\n3. Demand Models\n- Demand models are mathematical representations of\nthe relationship between demand and explanatory\nvariables:\n- Based on our assumptions of what affects air travel demand\n- Can be linear (additive) models or non-linear (multiplicative)\n- Model specification reflects expectations of demand behavior (e.g.,\nwhen prices rise, demand should decrease)\n- A properly estimated demand model allows airlines to\nmore accurately forecast demand in an O-D market:\n- As a function of changes in average fares\n- Given recent or planned changes to frequency of service\n- To account for changes in market or economic conditions\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nAirline Demand\n- Demand for carrier flight f of carrier i in OD market j\nis a function of:\n- Characteristics of flight f\n- Departure time, travel time, expected delay, aircraft type, in-flight\nservice, etc.\n- Price\n- Characteristics of carrier i\n- Flight schedule in market j (frequency, timetable), airport amenities of\ncarrier, frequent flyer plan attractiveness, etc.\n- Market characteristics\n- Distance, business travel between two cities, tourism appeal\n- Characteristics (including price) of all rival products:\n- Other flights on carrier i\n- Flights on other carriers in market j (carrier and flight characteristics)\n- Competing markets' products (other airports serving city-pair in j, other\ntransport modes, etc.)\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nTotal Trip Time from Point A to B\n- Next to price of air travel, most important factor\naffecting demand for airline services:\n- Access and egress times to/from airports at origin and destination\n- Pre-departure and post-arrival processing times at each airport\n- Actual flight times plus connecting times between flights\n- Schedule displacement or wait times due to inadequate frequency\n- Total trip time captures impacts of flight frequency,\npath quality relative to other carriers, other modes.\n- Reduction in total trip time should lead to increase in total air travel\ndemand in O-D market\n- Increased frequency and non-stop flights reduce total trip time\n- Increases in total trip time will lead to reduced demand for air travel,\neither to alternative modes or the \"no travel\" option\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nTotal Trip Time and Frequency\nT = t(fixed) + t(flight) + t(schedule displacement)\n- Fixed time elements include access and egress, airport processing\n- Flight time includes aircraft \"block\" times plus connecting times\n- Schedule displacement = (K hours / frequency), meaning it\ndecreases with increases in frequency of departures\n- This model is useful in explaining why:\n- Non-stop flights are preferred to connections (lower flight times)\n- More frequent service increases travel demand (lower schedule\ndisplacement times)\n- Frequency is more important in short-haul markets (schedule\ndisplacement is a much larger proportion of total T)\n- Many connecting departures through a hub might be better than 1\nnon-stop per day (lower total T for the average passenger)\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nSimple Market Demand Function\n- Multiplicative model of demand for travel O-D per\nperiod:\nD = M x Pa x Tb\nwhere:\nM = market sizing parameter (constant) that represents\nunderlying population and interaction between cities\nP = average price of air travel\nT = total trip time, reflecting changes in frequency\na,b = price and time elasticities of demand\n- We can estimate values of M, a, and b from historical\ndata sample of D, P, and T for same market:\n- Previous observations of demand levels (D) under different\ncombinations of price (P) and total travel time (T)\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nMultiple Demand Segments\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nDemand Models by Segment\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nDemand Models by Segment\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\n4. Airline Competition\n- Airlines compete for passengers and market share\nbased on:\n- Frequency of service and departure schedule on each route served\n- Price charged, relative to other airlines, to the extent that regulation\nallows for price competition\n- Quality of service and products offered -- airport and in-flight\nservice amenities and/or restrictions on discount fare products\n- Passengers choose combination of flight schedules,\nprices and product quality that minimizes disutility of\nair travel:\n- Each passenger would like to have the best service on a flight that\ndeparts at the most convenient time, for the lowest price\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nMarket Share / Frequency Share\n- Rule of Thumb: With all else equal, airline market\nshares will approximately equal their frequency\nshares.\n- But there is much empirical evidence of an \"S-curve\"\nrelationship as shown on the following slide:\n- Higher frequency shares are associated with disproportionately\nhigher market shares\n- An airline with more frequency captures all passengers wishing to\nfly during periods when only it offers a flight, and shares the\ndemand wishing to depart at times when both airlines offer flights\n- Thus, there is a tendency for competing airlines to match flight\nfrequencies in many non-stop markets, to retain market share\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nMS vs. FS \"S-Curve\" Model\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nS-Curve Model Formulation\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\n5. Airline Prices and O-D Markets\n- Like air travel demand, airline fares are defined for an\nO-D market, not for an an airline flight leg:\n- Airline prices for travel A-B depend on O-D market demand, supply\nand competitive characteristics in that market\n- No economic theoretical reason for prices in market A-B to be\nrelated to prices A-C, based strictly on distance traveled\n- Could be that price A-C is actually lower than price A-B\n- These are different markets with different demand characteristics,\nwhich might just happen to share joint supply on a flight leg\n- Dichotomy of airline demand and supply makes\nfinding an equilibrium between prices and distances\nmore difficult.\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nPrice Elasticity of Demand\n- Definition: Percent change in total demand that\noccurs with a 1% increase in average price charged.\n- Price elasticity of demand is always negative:\n- A 10% price increase will cause an X% demand decrease, all else\nbeing equal (e.g., no change to frequency or market variables)\n- Business air travel demand is slightly \"inelastic\" (0 > Ep > -1.0)\n- Leisure demand for air travel is much more \"elastic\" (Ep < -1.0)\n- Empirical studies have shown typical range of airline market price\nelasticities from -0.8 to -2.0 (air travel demand tends to be elastic)\n- Elasticity of demand in specific O-D markets will depend on mix of\nbusiness and leisure travel\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nImplications for Airline Pricing\n- Inelastic (-0.8) business demand for air travel means\nless sensitivity to price changes:\n- 10% price increase leads to only 8% demand reduction\n- Total airline revenues increase, despite price increase\n- Elastic (-1.6) leisure demand for air travel means\ngreater sensitivity to price changes\n- 10% price increase causes a 16% demand decrease\n- Total revenues decrease given price increase, and vice versa\n- Recent airline pricing practices are explained by price\nelasticities:\n- Increase fares for inelastic business travelers to increase revenues\n- Decrease fares for elastic leisure travelers to increase revenues\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nTime Elasticity of Demand\n- Definition: Percent change in total O-D demand that\noccurs with a 1% increase in total trip time.\n- Time elasticity of demand is also negative:\n- A 10% increase in total trip time will cause an X% demand decrease,\nall else being equal (e.g., no change in prices)\n- Business air travel demand is more time elastic (Et < -1.0), as\ndemand can be stimulated by improving travel convenience\n- Leisure demand is time inelastic (Et > -1.0), as price sensitive\nvacationers are willing to endure less convenient flight times\n- Empirical studies show narrower range of airline market time\nelasticities from -0.8 to -1.6, affected by existing frequency\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nImplications of Time Elasticity\n- Business demand responds more than leisure\ndemand to reductions in total travel time:\n- Increased frequency of departures is most important way for an\nairline to reduce total travel time in the short run\n- Reduced flight times can also have an impact (e.g., using jet vs.\npropeller aircraft)\n- More non-stop vs. connecting flights will also reduce T\n- Leisure demand not nearly as time sensitive:\n- Frequency and path quality not as important as price\n- But there exists a \"saturation frequency\" in each\nmarket:\n- Point at which additional frequency does not increase demand\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nTheoretical Pricing Strategies\n- For determining prices to charge in an O-D market,\nairlines can utilize one of following economic\nprinciples:\n- Cost-based pricing\n- Demand-based pricing\n- Service-based pricing\n- In practice, most airline pricing strategies reflect a\nmix of these theoretical principles:\n- Prices are also highly affected by competition in each O-D market\n- In the US, severe competition in some markets has led to \"price-\nbased costing\", meaning airlines must reduce costs to be able to\nmatch low-fare competitors and passengers' price expectations\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nPrice Discrimination vs. Product\nDifferentiation\n- Price discrimination:\n- The practice of charging different prices for same product with\nsame costs of production\n- Based solely on different consumers' \"willingness to pay\"\n- Product differentiation:\n- Charging different prices for products with different characteristics\nand costs of production\n- Current airline fare structures reflect both strategies:\n- Differential Pricing based on differentiated fare products\n- But higher prices for fare products targeted at business travelers\nare clearly based on their willingness to pay\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nAirline Pricing Practices\n- Differential pricing presents a trade-off to customers\nbetween inconvenience and price levels:\n- Business travelers are \"willing\" to pay higher fares in return for more\nconvenience, fewer restrictions on use of tickets\n- Leisure travelers less \"willing\" to pay higher prices, but accept\ndisutility \"costs\" of restrictions on low fare products\n- Economic concept of \"willingness to pay\" (WTP) is\ndefined by the theoretical price-demand curve:\n- \"Willingness\" does not mean \"happiness\" in paying higher prices\n- Differential pricing attempts to make those with higher WTP purchase\nthe less restricted higher-priced options\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nDifferential Pricing Theory (circa 2000)\n- Market segments with\ndifferent \"willingness to\npay\" for air travel\n- Different \"fare products\"\noffered to business\nversus leisure travelers\n- Prevent diversion by\nsetting restrictions on\nlower fare products and\nlimiting seats available\n- Increased revenues and\nhigher load factors than\nany single fare strategy\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nWhy Differential Pricing?\n- It allows the airline to increase total flight revenues\nwith little impact on total operating costs:\n- Incremental revenue generated by discount fare passengers who\notherwise would not fly\n- Incremental revenue from high fare passengers willing to pay more\n- Studies have shown that most \"traditional\" high-cost airlines could\nnot cover total operating costs by offering a single fare level\n- Consumers can also benefit from differential pricing:\n- Most notably, discount passengers who otherwise would not fly\n- It is also conceivable that high fare passengers pay less and/or\nenjoy more frequency given the presence of low fare passengers\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nTraditional Approach: Restrictions on\nLower Fares\n- Progressively more severe restrictions on low fare\nproducts designed to prevent diversion:\n- Lowest fares have advance purchase and minimum stay\nrequirements , as well as cancellation and change fees\n- Restrictions increase the inconvenience or \"disutility cost\" of low\nfares to travelers with high WTP, forcing them to pay more\n- Studies show \"Saturday night minimum stay\" condition to be most\neffective in keeping business travelers from purchasing low fares\n- Still, it is impossible to achieve perfect segmentation:\n- Some travelers with high WTP can meet restrictions\n- Many business travelers often purchase restricted fares\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nExample: Restriction Disutility

some LFAs and America West, followed by Alaska\n- Most recently, implemented in all US domestic markets by Delta,\nmatched selectively by legacy competitors\n- Simplified fare structures characterized by:\n- No Saturday night stay restrictions, but advance purchase and non-\nrefundable/change fees\n- Revenue management systems still control number of seats sold at\neach fare level\n- Higher load factors, but 10-15% lower revenues:\n- Significantly higher diversion with fewer restrictions\n\nMIT\nICAT\nMIT\nICAT\nExample: BOS-ATL Simplified Fares\nDelta Air Lines, April 2005\nOne Way\nFare

      "content": "Airline Demand Analysis and Spill Modeling\n\n16.75J/1.234J Airline Management\nDr. Peter P. Belobaba\nFebruary 2006\n\nStochastic and Cyclical Nature of Demand\n\n- The total demand for a particular flight even at a given time of day fluctuates by day\nof week and season of the year. In addition to these more predictable or \"cyclical\"\nfluctuations in demand, there are also less predictable or \"stochastic\" variations in\ndemand around the mean or expected value for a flight:\n\n-\nWe can represent the total uncertainty of demand for a future flight departure with\na probability distribution (density) of expected demand.\n\n-\nHistorically, a Gaussian (Normal) distribution of demand has been assumed, with\na mean and standard deviation that depend on the market being studied and on the\nnature of its traffic.\n\n-\nBased on many empirical studies of actual airline data, the standard deviation of\ntotal demand for a flight relative to the mean demand is typically between 0.20\nand 0.40. This measure is also known as the \"coefficient of variation\" or \"k-\nfactor\" of demand, defined as:\nk-factor = standard deviation / mean demand\n\n-\nThe \"k-factor\" of demand for a given flight will depend on the variability of\ndemand over a series of days, weeks or months. Leisure markets typically will\nhave higher k-factors of demand than business or mixed travel markets with more\nstable demand patterns.\n\n- It is important to understand that, in practice, it is difficult if not impossible to\nobserve the actual \"demand\" for a flight. This is especially true if at least some of the\ndepartures of a series of flights on the same route at the same time of day and/or day\nof week depart full:\n\n-\nAirlines have no way of keeping track of how many requests for bookings on a\ngiven flight departure were turned away or rejected if there was not enough\nspace on the aircraft to accommodate all passengers that wished to travel on the\nflight.\n\n-\nThe notion of \"total demand\" for a particular flight or set of flights operated\nover a period of time is therefore a theoretical concept. Thus, the analysis of\n\"total demand\" (as opposed to the number of passengers who actually were\ntransported) requires models and assumptions, as described below.\n\nTerms and Definitions\n\n- DEMAND: The total number of potential passengers wishing to make a reservation\non a particular scheduled flight leg. In line with our definition of \"demand\" for an\norigin-destination market in Air Transportation Economics, the \"demand\" for a flight\nleg reflects a maximum potential, independent of the capacity being offered on the\nflight.\n\n- LOAD: The total number of passengers who are actually carried on the flight leg.\nBecause the demand for a flight can sometimes be greater than its capacity, it must be\nthe case that load is always less than or equal to demand:\n\n- When demand is less than capacity, then load is equal to demand, as all potential\npassengers are accommodated and carried.\n\n- When demand exceeds capacity, then the load is equal to capacity, as some of the\npotential passengers cannot travel and must be rejected by the airline.\n\n- SPILL: The total number of potential passengers who cannot obtain a reservation and\ntravel on a given flight due to insufficient capacity. \"Spill\" is also known as \"rejected\ndemand\", since these passengers are rejected by the airline because the number of\nseats on the aircraft assigned to the flight is less than total potential demand.\n\n- Spill is by definition equal to total demand minus the total load of a flight.\n\n- When demand is less than capacity, load is equal to demand, and spill is zero.\n\n- When demand exceeds capacity, load is equal to capacity and spill is equal to\ndemand minus capacity (load).\n\n- \"Spill\" occurs as the result of greater potential demand for a flight than the physical\ncapacity of the aircraft assigned to operate on the flight leg in question. \"Spill\" has\nlittle direct relationship to overbooking, and must not be confused with \"denied\nboardings\". We will explore overbooking and denied boarding issues in much greater\ndetail in Module 6. In the meantime, the most important differences between the two\nconcepts can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \"Spill\" is the rejected demand resulting from operating two small an aircraft on a\nflight leg. It can occur whether or not the airline is using the practice of flight\noverbooking. For example, even if we assume no overbooking, an aircraft that\ndeparts with a load equal to capacity will likely have experienced spill.\n\n- \"Denied boardings\" occur when the airline overbooks its flights, and more\npassengers show up than there are physical seats available on the aircraft. Denied\nboardings can occur even if no spill occurred during the booking process (i.e., all\n\npotential travelers obtained reservations for their desired flight, but when they\nshowed up at the airport, there were not enough physical seats on the airplane to\naccommodate them. Denied boardings occurred because the airline overbooked\ntoo aggressively, not because the aircraft was too small for the demand.\n\n- Perhaps the best way to distinguish between \"spill\" and \"denied boardings\" is to\nrecognize that spill can occur during the booking process for a flight, as\nreservations requests are rejected because the aircraft is too small. On the other\nhand, denied boardings occur at the airport, just before departure.\n\nExample: Individual Flight Departures\n\n- It is common in the airline scheduling and fleet assignment process for the airline to\nassign the same aircraft type (capacity) to a series of departures of the same flight leg\nover a period of weeks or even months. Consider an example in which a 9:00 a.m.\nflight is scheduled to operate from Montreal (YUL) to Los Angeles (LAX) with a\nphysical capacity of 125 seats. Below is a hypothetical set of loads as observed by\nthe airline, for a sample of 5 Friday morning departures:\n\nDATE\nLOAD\nCAPACITY LOAD FACTOR\nSPILL?\n01 APR\n\n73.6%\n\nNO\n08 APR\n\n100.0%\n\nLIKELY\n15 APR\n\n86.4%\n\nNO\n22 APR\n\n66.4%\n\nNO\n29 APR\n\n98.4%\n\nPOSSIBLY\n\n- For this sample of five Friday morning flight departures, the airline can observe the\nfollowing:\n\n- The Average Load Factor (ALF) of this flight leg over the 5 departures is 85.0%.\n\n- Three of the departures (on April 1, 15 and 22) had an observed load substantially\nless than capacity, so we can assume that no spill occurred on these departures\nand that total demand is well represented by the observed load.\n\n- On April 8, the flight departed full, meaning that potential demand for the flight\nwas at least 125, and likely greater than 125. We assume that a full flight is an\nindication of rejected demand or passenger spill having occurred.\n\n- The April 29 flight departed with a load of 123, yet the table above suggests that\nspill was \"possible\" on this flight. This is because flights that depart with very\nhigh load factors likely reached their physical and/or booking capacity at some\npoint close to departure, resulting in spill. Passenger no-shows and/or last-minute\ncancellations of reservations in the real world can lead to a load slightly below\ncapacity, even though demand was rejected.\n\n- For the purposes of fleet assignment, the question that this example raises is whether\nthe 125-seat aircraft assigned to this flight leg for the period of 5 Fridays in question\nwas the best choice of available aircraft types in terms of its capacity, as opposed to\nbeing \"too big\" or \"too small\":\n\n- The 125-seat aircraft was clearly adequate for the three departures with observed\nload factors well below 100%.\n\n- However, the possibility exists that the 125-seat aircraft was too small to\naccommodate all of the potential demand on the other 2 departures identified as\ncandidates for having rejected demand.\n\n- The challenge of spill analysis for fleet assignment decision making is to try to\nestimate what the actual \"unconstrained\" demand might have been for the departures\nwith inadequate capacity. The question is, \"if the flight is/was operated with a bigger\ncapacity, how much would spill decrease and by how much would the total revenue\nof the flight increase?\"\n\n- Estimation of unconstrained demand requires a sample of observed load data for\nmultiple departures operated with a given aircraft capacity. We cannot estimate\nthe amount of spill or the unconstrained demand based on observed load data for a\nsingle departure.\n\n- For example, because the April 8 flight departed with a 100% load factor, it is\nvery likely that demand was rejected during the booking process for that flight.\nHowever, all we know is that unconstrained demand potential for that departure\nwas greater than (or equal to) 125 - we have no way of estimating how much\ngreater it was.\n\n- With a sample of multiple departures, we can use statistical techniques for\nestimating average spill and average unconstrained demand on a \"typical\"\ndeparture. These techniques are known as \"spill models\" and are describe in\ndetail in the next section.\n\nSpill Model for Estimating Spill and Unconstrained Demand\n\n- Variations of the \"spill model\" for airline demand analysis, specifically for estimating\nspill and unconstrained demand, have been developed both at MIT and by Boeing.\nThe basic spill model makes the following assumptions:\n\n-\nTotal demand for a flight departure or series of flight departures can be\nrepresented by a Gaussian distribution.\n\n-\nThe demand distribution has a mean and standard deviation that is known or\nwhich can be estimated from a sample observed historical load data for the same\nor similar flights.\n\n-\nThe estimated demand distribution can represent the magnitude and variability of\ndemand for future flight departures, if properly adjusted for trends and/or seasonal\nchanges in demand.\n\n- The details of the Boeing Spill Model are described in \"Load Factor Analysis: The\nRelationship Between Flight Load and Passenger Turnaway\" (1978). In the\nremainder of this section, the use of the spill model approach to estimate spill and\ndemand for the previous simple example of five flight departures is explained.\n\n- In our example, based on the sample of five flight departures, we can calculate that\nthe mean load was 106.2 passengers per flight, with a sample standard deviation of\n18.6:\n\n-\nBased on these measures, we can calculate the average load factor as:\nALF = Mean Load/Capacity = 106.2/125 = 85.0%\n\n-\nThe k-factor of the observed loads in the sample is:\nK = Standard deviation / Mean Load = 18.6/106.2 = 0.175\n\n- However, we know that 2 of the flights were full or close to full, suggesting that spill\noccurred on these departures. This further means that the following must be true:\n\n-\nThe observed mean load per flight of 106.2 is less than the \"true\" or\nunconstrained total mean demand for these flights (since there was some spill).\n\n-\nThe observed standard deviation of loads is less than the \"true\" standard deviation\nof demand for these flights (since on 2 of the flights, the capacity constraint\nlimited our ability to observe how variable the actual demand was).\n\n- The Boeing Spill Model approach relies on the properties of the Gaussian distribution\nto estimate spill and unconstrained demand, in one of several ways:\n\n-\nNormalized \"spill tables\" are the simplest way to estimate spill and unconstrained\ndemand, and will be described here.\n\n-\nUse of \"normal probability paper\" to plot observed loads and estimate the mean\nand standard deviation of total demand is more complicated and is described in\nthe Boeing paper.\n\n-\nUse of iterative statistical estimation methods is even more complicated, and well\nbeyond the scope of this course.\n\n- To make use of the \"Spill Table\" approach to estimation, the following additional\nterms and definitions are required:\n\n-\nDEMAND FACTOR is the mean total (unconstrained) demand per flight divided\nby the aircraft capacity. Unlike average load factor, the demand factor can exceed\n1.0, as it is possible for mean total demand to exceed the assigned aircraft\ncapacity. It is the total mean demand and/or the demand factor that we are trying\nto estimate, given an observed average load factor.\n\n-\nSPILL FACTOR is the average (or \"expected\") spilled passengers per flight\ndivided by the aircraft capacity. Again, estimation of mean spill and/or the spill\nfactor is the goal of our estimation effort.\n\n-\nSPILL RATE is the average (or \"expected\") spilled passengers per flight divided\nby the mean total demand for the flight. Thus, it is a measure of the probability or\nlikelihood that a random passenger wishing to make a reservation for a flight will\nnot be able to due to inadequate aircraft capacity. It is also the proportion of total\ndemand that is rejected.\n\n- Given these definitions and those introduced earlier the following relationships must\napply for a sample of flight departures with any degree of variability in demand (i.e.,\nwith a standard deviation greater than zero):\n\n-\nMean demand is greater than or equal to the mean observed load. Mean demand\nis equal to mean load only if none of the flight departures in the sample\nexperienced spill.\n\n-\nDemand factor is greater than or equal to average load factor. Demand factor is\nequal to average load factor only if none of the flight departures in the sample\nexperienced spill.\n\n-\nMean demand is always equal to mean observed load plus mean spill per flight.\n\n-\nDemand factor is always equal to average load factor plus spill factor.\n\n-\nSpill rate and spill factor must both be greater than zero if any of the flight\ndepartures in the sample experienced spill.\n\nExample: Use of Spill Tables\n\n- The Boeing Spill Tables contain \"pre-calculated\" relationships between demand\nfactor, load factor, and spill factor, based on the assumed Gaussian distribution of\ntotal demand for a flight. We can use these tables to answer two types of questions:\n\n-\nGiven an observed mean load factor and an assumed k-factor of unconstrained\ntotal demand, what is the corresponding demand factor and spill factor?\n\n-\nGiven an estimate of demand factor for a flight and an assumed k-factor of\nunconstrained total demand, what would be the corresponding average load factor\nand spill factor?\n\n- Thus, the spill table approach requires the user to assume a k-factor of unconstrained\ntotal demand for a flight. This assumption is essentially a \"best guess\", based on\nprevious experience with demand variability for a given flight or within a particular\nmarket. This requirement is a minor limitation of the spill table approach that is not\nshared by the more complicated estimation methods mentioned earlier.\n\n-\nFor this example, we will assume a \"typical\" k-factor of total demand of 0.35.\n\n-\nThe Boeing Spill Table for demand factor k=0.35 is attached.\n\n- For our small example of 5 departures, we have the following information:\n\n-\nMean observed load = 106.2\n\n-\nAverage load factor = 85.0%\n\n- Now, using the Boeing Spill Table for k=0.35, we can read the following:\n\n-\nFor average load factor 85.0%, the estimated demand factor is 0.972 and the\nestimated spill factor is 0.122. Note that DF = LF + SF in all cases!\n\n- These estimated values from the Spill table allow us to make the following additional\ncalculations for this flight sample:\n\n-\nMean total demand = Demand Factor * Capacity = 0.972 *125 = 121.5\n\n-\nStandard deviation of demand = 0.35 * Mean demand = 0.35 * 121.5 = 42.5\n\n-\nMean spill per flight = Spill Factor * Capacity = 0.122 * 125 = 15.25\n\n-\nSpill rate per flight = Mean Spill/Mean Demand = 15.25/121.5 = 12.55%\n\n- If we believe that our (admittedly small) sample of 5 departures of this flight is\nrepresentative of the demand for the flight, then we can estimate that if the airline\ncontinues to use a 125-seat aircraft, the loss of demand and revenue due to spill\nappears to be substantial:\n\n-\nAs a general rule, spill rates much higher than approximately 5% are regarded by\nmost airline managers as being \"too high\". A loss of potential revenue of\nsubstantially more than 5% is a significant lost opportunity for airlines that\ntypically struggle to exceed a 5% operating margin.\n\n- In our example, it appears that the use of a 125-seat aircraft to serve this estimated\ndemand distribution results in substantial spill and loss of potential revenue. The spill\ntable approach can be used to estimate how much spill might be reduced if the airline\nwere to assign a 140-seat aircraft to this flight for future departures:\n\n-\nWith a mean total demand of 121.5, the demand factor for a 140-seat aircraft\nwould be DF = 121.5/140 = 0.868.\n\n-\nNOTE: The mean total unconstrained demand does not change with a change in\naircraft size, as long as there are no differences in passenger preferences between\nthe alternative aircraft types.\n\n-\nGiven a new demand factor of 0.868, the spill table shows an estimated load\nfactor of about 0.802 and an estimated spill factor of 0.066 (some \"interpolation\"\nis required between the demand factors of 0.865 and 0.870 shown on the table).\n\n- Therefore, if the airline were to switch from a 125- to a 140-seat aircraft to serve the\ndemand for this flight, it could expect the following:\n\n-\nAn average load factor of 80.2%, as read from the Spill Table\n\n-\nAn average observed load equal to 0.802*140 = 112.3 passengers per flight, an\nincrease of 6.1 passengers compared to the 125-seat aircraft.\n\n-\nAverage spill per flight equal to 0.066*140 = 9.24 passengers per flight, a\ndecrease of just over 6 spilled passengers compared to the 125-seat aircraft.\n\n-\nA spill rate of 9.24/121.5 = 7.6%, down from 12.6% with the smaller aircraft.\n\n- Clearly, assignment of a bigger aircraft results in higher loads (but lower load\nfactors), increased revenues, and reduced spill and spill rate, as expected. In this\ncase, given our assumption of k=0.35 for total unconstrained demand, the demand\ndistribution reflects quite high (but not atypical) demand variability. With such high\nvariation of demand relative to the mean even a 15-seat increase in capacity does not\neliminate spill:\n\n-\nThe fleet assignment question for the airline is whether the increase in revenue\nfrom the increased capacity to accommodate on average 6 additional passengers\nper flight exceeds the additional operating cost of the 140-seat aircraft compared\nto the 125-seat aircraft used currently. If so, then the airline will increase its\noperating profit by assigning the larger aircraft to this particular flight leg."

Frequency Planning\n- Frequency of departures on a route improves\nconvenience of air travel for passengers and\nincreases market share:\n- Peak departure times (early morning and late afternoon) are most\nattractive to a larger proportion of travelers in many markets\n- More frequent departures further reduce schedule displacement or\n\"wait time\" between flights, reducing travel inconvenience\n- Frequency is much more important in short-haul markets than for\nlong-haul routes where actual flight time dominates \"wait time\"\n- In competitive markets, airline frequency share is most important to\ncapturing time sensitive business travelers\n- Frequency of departures can be as important as path quality (non-\nstop vs. connection) in many cases\n\nFrequency Planning Process\n- Demand forecasts and competition drive the\nfrequency of flights on a route:\n- Estimates of total demand between origin and destination\n- Expected market share of total demand, which is determined by\nfrequency share relative to competitors\n- Potential for additional traffic from connecting flights\n- \"Load consolidation\" affects frequency and aircraft\nsize decisions:\n- Single flight with multiple stops provides service to several origin-\ndestination markets at the same time\n- Allows airline to operate higher frequency and/or larger aircraft\n- A fundamental reason for economic success of airline hubs\n\n3. Timetable Development\n- For a chosen frequency of service on each route, next step\nis to develop a specific timetable of flight departures:\n- Goal is to provide departures at peak periods (0900 and 1700)\n- But, not all departures can be at peak periods on all possible\nroutes, given aircraft fleet and rotation considerations\n- Minimum \"turn-around\" times required at each stop to\ndeplane/enplane passengers, re-fuel and clean aircraft\n- For example, 0900 departure from city A with 1100 arrival at\nB results in possible departure of aircraft from B at 1200\n- If this aircraft is to return to A, 1200 departure will be off-peak\nand have potentially lower demand, but keeping the aircraft\non the ground until the next peak period reduces aircraft\nutilization (block hours per day)\n\nTimetable Development Constraints\n- Most airlines choose to maximize aircraft utilization:\n- Keep ground \"turn-around\" times to a minimum\n- Fly even off-peak flights to maintain frequency share and to\nposition aircraft for peak flights at other cities\n- Leaves little buffer time for maintenance and weather delays\n- Numerous constraints affect timetable development:\n- Hub networks require that flights arrive from spoke cities within a\nprescribed time range, to facilitate passenger connections\n- Time zone differences limit feasible departure times (e.g., flights\nfrom US to Europe do not depart before 1700, as passengers do not\nwant to arrive at their destination before 0600)\n- Airport slot times, noise curfews limit scheduling flexibility\n- Crew scheduling and routine maintenance requirements also affect\ntimetable development\n\nTimetable Development Process\n- Complexity and size of timetable development\nproblem make most schedule changes incremental:\n- A single change in departure time of a flight from A can have major\nimpacts on down-line times, connections, aircraft rotations, and\neven number of aircraft required to operate the schedule\n- Further complicated by crew and maintenance schedule needs,\nrequiring coordination with several airline operational departments\n- There are no computer models that can determine \"optimal\"\ntimetable, given huge combination of departure/arrival times,\ndemand and market share estimates, and thousands of constraints\n- However, interactive computer scheduling databases and decision\nsupport tools allow for much faster \"what-if\" analysis\n- Substantial decision support progress in fleet assignment and\naircraft rotation optimization\n\n4.

Belobaba\n16.75J/1.234J Airline Management\nMarch 1, 2006\n\nEvolution of PODS\nDeveloped by Boeing in early 1990s\n4 Simulate passenger choice of airline/paths given\nschedule alternatives (Decision Window Model)\nJoint development with MIT since 1994\n4 Refinement of choice models for different fares\nand restrictions\n4 Integration of realistic airline RM capabilities\nNow widely recognized as \"state of the art\" RM\nsimulator with realistic competitive impacts\n\nPODS Capabilities\nPODS simulates interaction of RM systems and\npassenger choice in competitive markets:\n4 Two or more competitors in large hub network\n4Airlines must forecast booking demand from actual\n(previously simulated) historical data\n4 Assumes passengers choose among O-D\npaths/fare types and airlines based on availability\n4 Choice also affected by competitive schedules,\nfares, restrictions, path quality, preferences\n\nePODS Base Network Characteristics\nFive airlines, 5 hubs serving 40 spoke cities\n4 Each airline has one hub serving 10 cities on\neach side; including flights to other hub cities\n4 Each hub has two directional connecting banks\nper day (2 eastbound, 2 westbound)\n4 Each spoke city served by 1-5 competing airlines,\nbased on population\n4 Airlines will be able to add/remove flights on\nspoke routes from own hub, as well as initiate new\nnon-stop \"bypass\" flights\n\nAirline Fleets\nEach airline operates a fleet of 20 aircraft\n4 4 different types (and sizes) with different costs\nand range capabilities\n4 Ownership costs based on lease rates\nAirline fleet decisions\n4 Players can (eventually) acquire additional aircraft\nof all types, subject to game limits\n4 Fleet assignment -- airlines choose aircraft sizes\nto match demand on \"schedule turns\"\n\nePODS Fleet Characteristics\nA/C Type\nSeats\nOp Cost /\nblock hr\nDaily\nOwnership\nCost per\ndeparture\nS120\n$1700\n$5450\n$750\nM150\n$1850\n$7200\n$800\nL180\n$2380\n$8100\n$900\nX220\n$2950\n$9200\n$950\n\nRoute Decisions\nAirlines can change routes and frequency of\nflights, subject to several constraints\n4 Add or delete spoke routes to/from own hub only\n4 Choose from set of feasible \"schedule turns\" to\nmaintain aircraft rotation balance\n4 Each aircraft can make one east-west-east or\nwest-east-west round-trip per day\n4 Each spoke city may be served once or twice\ndaily (maximum of two connecting banks in each\ndirection)\n\nSchedule Decisions\nHubs and number of connecting banks fixed\n4 Airlines can move connecting bank times\n4 Schedule decisions based on feasible \"schedule\nturns\" out of hub to spoke and back\n4 Schedule.xls worksheets allow only feasible\nschedule turns, and ensure total aircraft use\nremains within available fleet limits\n4 Excel interface with user-friendly \"point & click\"\nfunctionality for making schedule changes\n\nScheduling Information\nSchedule times for all aircraft:\n4 Block time = 0.67 + 0.001967*distance (miles)\n4 Minimum turn time at spoke cities = 40 minutes\nConnecting banks:\n4 Connecting bank duration = 1 hour\n4 All inbound aircraft scheduled to arrive at same\ntime; outbound aircraft depart at same time\n4 Moving bank start times affects spoke departure\ntimes and can change feasible spoke cities\n\nPricing Decisions\nInitial fare structure to be fixed for all airlines\n4 4 fare classes per market; fixed price ratios\n4 Unrestricted Y fare; 3 discount fares with\nincreasing restrictions\n4 All airlines have same RM systems\nAirline teams to have limited pricing flexibility\n4 System-wide changes to fare structures possible,\nwith match or no-match\n\nBase ePODS Fare Structure\nFare\nClass\nAdv.\nBkg.\nMin.\nStay\nChge\nFee\nNon-\nRefund\nFare\nCalculation\n1000 mi\nExample\nY\nNone\nNo\nNo\n4.00 * Q\n$360\nM\ndays\nSat.\nnight\nNo\nNo\n2.00 * Q\n$180\nB\ndays\nSat.\nnight\nYes\nNo\n1.50 * Q\n$135\nQ\ndays\nSat.\nnight\nYes\nYes\n$50 + 0.04 * d\n$90\n\n\"Vanilla\" RM System\nAirlines' RM systems forecast fare class\ndemand for each flight leg departure:\n4Moving average (\"pick-up\") forecasts of bookings\nto come\n4Unconstraining of based on booking curve\nprobabilities.\nLeg-based EMSRb seat protection model:\n4Booking limits for each fare class on each flight leg\ndeparture, revised 16 times in booking process.\nNo overbooking or no-shows in ePODS.\n\nData Available to Teams\nComplete estimates of operating costs\n4 Direct costs per block hour, per aircraft departure,\nper passenger carried\nUp to date competitive information\n4 Schedules and prices of airlines in all markets,\nafter each game iteration\nHistorical market data with time lag\n4 O-D market traffic, average fares and airline\nmarket shares (like DOT 10% database)\n\nAdditional Operating Costs\nReservations and Sales\n4 14.2% of Passenger Revenues\nTraffic servicing at airports\n4 $16 per passenger enplanement\nPassenger servicing on board\n4 $0.015 per RPM flown\n\nOutput Reports to Teams\nOperating statements after each game iteration\n4 Detailed traffic and revenue reports by market,\nflight and system\n4 Average flight load factors, fare mix and yields\n4 Operating costs by category and total contribution\n4 Aircraft schedule and utilization summaries\n\nGame Administration\nCompetitive airline planning game\n4 Aircraft fleets, route selection, frequency and\ntiming of flights, pricing decisions\nEach iteration is a \"typical day\" of operations\n4 Objectives to maximize contribution, increase\nmarket share and revenues, reduce operating\ncosts, improve operational efficiency\n4 In 16.75, will be run for 6 iterations, approximately\nonce per week +."
