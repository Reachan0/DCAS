We build upon the mathematics and physics courses of the freshman year, extending Newtonian Mechanics to address and understand the elastic behavior of trusses and frames, beams and cylinders. We aim also to engage students in the formulation and resolution of open-ended, design-type exercises, thereby bridging the divide between scientific theory and engineering practice.\n\nTextbook\n\nBucciarelli, Louis.\nEngineering Mechanics for Structures\n, Fall 2002.

You will document your work in a journal (the Mead Composition book).\n\nFinal Exam 30%\n\nThere will be a final exam.\n\nHomework\n\nHomework will be assigned weekly, evaluated and returned to you (within a week). It will serve as a basis for discussion with the Teaching Assistant and Professor Bucciarelli.\n\nDesign Exercise Journal Instructions\n\nThe journal, the quad-ruled composition book, 10 1/4 X 7 7/8 in, is for recording your work as you progress. Think of its contents, not as a polished text for presentation, nor as a complete record of every thought and word that comes to mind, but as a sufficiently full account of your thinking which would enable you to go back after some time has elapsed to reconstruct your reasoning, conjectures, and analysis. Write in ink. If you change your mind or find an error, don't erase; drawn a line through what is no longer wanted.\n\nPut your name, email, and phone number somewhere prominent; if lost, you want it returned. Leave the first few pages blank; make up a table of contents here as you go along. number the pages as you go along.\n\nAt the end of each exercise, summarize, on one or two pages, the results of your efforts - e.g, a dimensioned sketch; an explanation of what parameters are critical; a restating of specifications; a note of difficult constraints.\n\nTwo grades will be assigned for each exercise: One for \"presentation\", the other for \"analysis\". These two are not entirely independent. If your presentation is too cryptic or unreadable, evaluation of your analysis may be impossible and you will receive no credit. If your analysis omits references to sources - other students, a Web url, a reference textbook - your presentation will be judged inadequate and unethical. The two grades count equally.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\nProcess is as important as product; means as important as ends.\n\nImportant Note About Academic Honesty\n\nWe encourage you to work with your peers on homework and the design exercises. We do not condone copying. What is the difference? A valued and honest collaboration occurs when, for example, you \"get stuck\" early on in attacking an exercise and go to your classmate with a relevant question. Your colleague then has the opportunity to learn from your question as well as help you. You then bring something to the collaboration.\n\nOften we will form teams of two or three students to tackle the design exercises. And you can learn too from last year's problem sets and quizzes if used as a check or corrective when you seem to have hit a dead end. In doing the design exercises, you may have occasion to use the Web as a resource. We encourage that too.\nIn all cases you are to reference your sources and collaborators, whether other students, the Web, archived solutions, etc.",

      "content": "Introduction\n1.1\nWhat's it about\nThis is a book about the Mechanics of Solids, Statics, the Strength of Materials,\nand Elasticity Theory. But that doesn't mean a thing unless you have had a course\nin the Mechanics of Solids, Statics, the Strength of Materials, or Elasticity The\nory. I assume you have not; let us try again:\nThis is a book that builds upon what you were supposed to learn in your basic\nphysics and mathematics courses last year. We will talk about forces - not politi\ncal, but vector forces - about moments and torques, reactions, displacements, lin\near springs, and the requirements of static equilibrium of a particle or a rigid\nbody. We will solve sets of linear algebraic equations and talk about when we can\nnot find a unique solution to a set of linear algebraic equations. We will derive a\nwhole raft of new equations that apply to particles, bodies, structures, and mecha-\nnisms; these will often contain the spatial derivatives of forces, moments, and dis\nplacements. You have seen a good bit of the basic stuff of this course before, but\nwe will not assume you know the way to talk about, or work with, these concepts,\nprinciples, and methods so fundamental to our subject. So we will recast the\nbasics in our own language, the language of engineering mechanics.\nFor the moment, think of this book as a language text; of yourself as a lan\nguage student beginning the study of Engineering Mechanics, the Mechanics of\nSolids, the Strength of Materials, and Elasticity Theory. You must learn the lan\nguage if you aspire to be an engineer. But this is a difficult language to learn,\nunlike any other foreign language you have learned. It is difficult because, on the\nsurface, it appears to be a language you already know. That is deceptive: You will\nhave to be on guard, careful not to presume the word you have heard before bears\nthe same meaning. Words and phrases you have already encountered now take on\na more special and, in most cases, narrower meaning; a couple of forces is more\nthan just two forces.\nAn important part of learning the vocabulary, is the quick sketch. Along with\nlearning to sketch in the engineering mechanics way, you will have to learn the\nmeaning of certain icons; a small circle, for example, becomes a frictionless pin.\nSo too, grammar and syntax will be crucial. Rigorous rules must be learned and\nobeyed. Some of these rules will at first seem pedantic; they may strike you as not\nonly irrelevant to solving the problem, but wrong-headed or counter intuitive. But\ndon't despair; with use they will become familiar and reliable friends.\nWhen you become able to speak and respond in a foreign language without\nthinking of every word, you start to see the world around you from a new perspec\n\nChapter 1\ntive. What was once a curiosity now is mundane and used everyday, often without\nthinking. So too, in this course, you will look at a tree and see its limbs as cantile\nver beams, you will look at a beam and see an internal bending moment, you will\nlook at a bending moment and conjecture a stress distribution. You will also be\nasked to be creative in the use of this new language, to model, to estimate, to\ndesign.\nThat's the goal: To get you seeing the world from the perspective of an engi\nneer responsible for making sure that the structure does not fail, that the mecha\nnism doesn't make too much noise, that the bridge doesn't sway in the wind, that\nthe latch latches firmly, the landing gear do not collapse upon touchdown, the\ndrive-shaft does not fracture in fatigue... Ultimately, that is what this book is\nabout. Along the way you will learn about stress, strain, the behavior of trusses,\nbeams, of shafts that carry torsion, even columns that may buckle.\n1.2\nWhat you will be doing.\nThe best way to learn a foreign language is from birth; but then it's no longer a\nforeign language. The next best way to learn a new language is to use it - speak it,\nread it, listen to it on audio tapes, watch it on television; better yet, go to the land\nwhere it is the language in use and use it to buy a loaf of bread, get a hotel room\nfor the night, ask to find the nearest post office, or if you are really proficient,\nmake a telephone call. So too in the Mechanics of Solids, we insist you begin to\nuse the language.\nDoing problems and exercises, taking quizzes and the final, is using the lan\nguage. This book contains mostly exercises explained as well as exercises for you\nto tackle. There are different kinds of exercises, different kinds for the different\ncontexts of language use.\nSometimes an engineer will be asked a question and a response will be\nexpected in five minutes. You will not have time to go to the library, access a data\nbase, check this textbook. You must estimate, conjure up a rational response on\nthe spot. \"....How many piano tuners in the city of Chicago?\" (Try it)! Some of the\nexercises that follow will be labeled estimate.\nOften practicing engineers must ask what they need to know in order to tackle\nthe task they have been assigned. So too we will ask you to step back from a prob\nlem and pose a new problem that will help you address the original problem. We\nwill label these exercises need to know.\nA good bit of engineering work is variation on a theme, changing things\naround, recasting a story line, and putting it into your own language for produc\ntive and profitable use. Doing this requires experimentation, not just with hard\nware, but with concepts and existing designs. One poses \"what if we make this\nstrut out of aluminum... go to a cantilever support... pick up the load in bending?\"\nWe will label this kind of exercise what if?\nEngineering analysis (as well as prototype testing and market studies) is what\njustifies engineering designs. As an engineer you will be asked to show that your\n\nIntroduction\ndesign will actually work. More specifically, in the terms of this subject, you will\nbe asked to show the requirements of static equilibrium ensure your proposed\nstructure will bear the anticipated loading, that the maximum deflection of simply\nsupported beam at midspan does not exceed the value specified in the contract,\nthat the lowest resonant frequency of the payload is above 100 Hz. The show that.\nlabel indicates a problem where a full analysis is demanded. Most often this kind\nof problem will admit of a single solution - in contrast to the estimate, need to\nknow, or even what if exercise. This is the form of the traditional textbook prob\nlem set.\nClosely related to show that exercises, you will be asked to construct a\nresponse to questions, as in \"construct an explanation explaining why the beam\nfailed\", or \"construct an expression for the force in member ab\". We could have\nused the ordinary language, \"explain\" or \"derive\" in these instances but I want to\nemphasize the initiative you, as learner, must take in explaining or deriving. Here,\ntoo, construct better reflects what engineers actually do at work.\nFinally, what engineers do most of the time is design, design in the broadest\nsense of the term; they play out scenarios of things working, construct stories and\nplans that inform others how to make things that will work according to their\nplans. These design exercises are the most open-ended and unconstrained exer\ncises you will find in this text. We will have more to say about them later.\nIn working all of these different kinds of exercises, we want you to use the lan\nguage with others. Your one-on-one confrontation with a problem set or an exam\nquestion can be an intense dialogue but it's not full use of the language. Your abil\nity to speak and think in the language of engineering mechanics is best developed\nthrough dialogue with your peers, your tutors, and your teacher. We encourage\nyou to learn from your classmates, to collectively learn from each other's mis\ntakes and questions as well as problem-solving abilities.\nExercise 1.1 An Introductory Exercise\nAnalyse the behavior of the mechanism shown in the figure. That is, deter\nmine how the deflection, ∆, of point B varies as the load, P, varies.\nΘ0\nΘ\nP\nL\nL\nk\nk\n∆\nu\nu\nA\nB\nC\nL cos Θ0\nL cos Θ\n\nChapter 1\nThis exercise is intended to introduce the essential concepts and principles of the\nengineering mechanics of solids. It is meant as an overview; do not be disturbed\nby the variety of concepts or range of vocabulary. We will try to grasp the essen\ntial workings of the device and begin to see the relevance of the concepts and\nprinciples of engineering mechanics to an understanding of how it functions and\nhow it might be made to work better\nWe will apply the requirements of static equilibrium. We will analyze the dis\nplacements of different points of the structure, e.g., the vertical displacement of\npoint B and the horizontal displacements of points A and C, and make sure these\nare compatible. We will consider the deformation of the springs which connect\npoints A and C to ground and posit a relationship between the force each one\nbears and the relative displacement of one end with respect to the other end. We\nwill assume this force/deformation relationship is linear.\nWe will learn to read the figure; k is the constant of proportionality in the\nequation relating the force in the spring to its deformation; the little circles are\nfrictionless pins, members AB and BC are two-force members -- as straight mem\nbers they carry only tension and compression. The grey shading represents rigid\nground. The arrow represents a vertically applied load whose magnitude is \"P\".\nOur aim is to determine the behavior of the structure as the applied load\nincreases from zero to some or any finite value. In particular, we want to deter\nmine how ∆ varies as P changes. We will use a spread sheet to make a graph of\nthis relationship -- but only after setting up the problem in terms of non-dimen-\nsional expressions for the applied load, P, the vertical displacement, ∆, and the\nhorizontal displacement, u. We will allow for relatively large displacements and\nrotations. We will investigate the possibility of snap-through, a type of instability,\nif P gets too large. In sum, our objective is to determine how the applied load P\nvaries with ∆, or, alternatively, for any prescribed ∆, what P need be applied?\nWe will discuss how this funny looking linkage of impossible parts (friction\nless pins, rollers, rigid grey matter, point loads, ever linear springs) can be a use\nful model of real-world structures. There is much to be said; all of this italicized\nlanguage important.\nWe start by reasoning thus:\nClearly the vertical displacement, ∆, is related to the horizontal displacements\nof points A and C; as these points move outward, point B moves downward. We\nassume our system is symmetric; the figure suggests this; if A moves out a dis\ntance u, C displaces to the right the same distance. Note: Both u and ∆ are mea\nsured from the undeformed or unloaded configuration, P, ∆ = 0 . (This\nundeformend configuration is indicated by the dashed lines and the angle Θ0 ). As\nP increases, ∆ increases and so too u which causes the springs to shorten. This\nengenders a compressive force in the springs and in the members AB and BC,\nalbeit of a different magnitude, which in turn, ensures static equilibrium of the\nsystem and every point within it including the node B where the load P is applied.\nBut enough talk; enough story telling. We formulate some equations and try to\nsolve them.\n\nIntroduction\nStatic Equilibrium of Node B.\nThe figure at the right shows an isola-\nB\nP\ntion of node B. It is a free body diagram;\ni.e., the node has been cut free of all that\nsurrounds it and the influence of those sur\nroundings have been represented by forces.\nF\nThe node is compressed by the force, F,\nF\nΘ\ncarried by the members AB and BC. We\nΘ\ndefer a proof that the force must act along\nthe member to a later date.\nEquilibrium requires that the resultant force on the node vanish; symmetry,\nwith respect to a vertical plane containing P and perpendicular to the page,\nassures this requirement is satisfied in the horizontal direction; equilibrium in the\nvertical direction gives:\n2F ⋅ sin θ - P = 0\nor\nF = P ⁄ (2 sin θ)\nStatic Equilibrium of Node C.\nF\nThe figure at the right shows an isolation of\nnode C. Note how I have drawn F in this isola-\nΘ\nfs\ntion acting opposite to the direction of F shown\nin the isolation of node B. This is because\nmember BC is in compression. The member is\ncompressing node C as it is compressing node\nC\nB. R is the reaction force on the node due to the\nR\nground. It is vertical since the rollers signify\nthat there is no resistance to motion in the hori\nzontal direction; there is no friction. fs is the compressive force in the spring,\nagain, pressing on the node C.\nEquilibrium requires that the resultant of the three forces vanish. Requiring\nthat the sum of the horizontal components and that the sum of the vertical compo\nnents vanish independently will ensure that the vector sum, which is the resultant,\nwill vanish. This yields two scalar equations:\nF ⋅ cos θ - f = 0\nand\nR\nF\n\n⋅ sin θ = 0\n-\ns\nThe first ensures equilibrium in the horizontal direction, the second, in the vertical direc\ntion.\nForce/Deformation of the spring:\nFor our linear spring, we can write:\nf = k u\n⋅\ns\nThe force is proportional to deformation.\n\nChapter 1\nCompatibility of Deformation:\n∆ and Θ are not independent; you can not choose one arbitrarily, then the other\narbitrarily. The first figure indicates that, if members AB and BC remain continu\nousand rigid1, we have\nu = L( cos θ - cos θ0 )\nBut we want ∆, ultimately. Another compatibility relationship is seen to be\n∆ = L( sin θ0 - sin θ)\nSolution: The relation between P and ∆.\nFrom equilibrium of node B we have an equation for F, the compressive force\nin members AB and BC in terms of P and θ; Using our result obtained from equi\nlibrium of node C, we can express the force in the spring, fs in terms of P and θ.\nf = (P ⁄ 2)( cos θ ⁄ sin θ)\ns\nFrom the force/deformation relationship for the spring we express, u, the dis\nplacement of the node C (and A) in terms of fs, and, using the immediately above,\nin terms of P and θ.\nu = f ⁄ k = (P ⁄ 2k )( cos θ ⁄ sin θ)\ns\nThe first compatibility relationship then allows us to write\n(P ⁄ 2kL) = sin θ ⋅(1 - cos θ0 ⁄ cos θ)\nwhile the second may be written in non-dimensional form as\n∆⁄ L = sin θ0 - sin θ\nWe could at this point try to eliminate theta; but this is unnecessary. This parametric form\nof the relationship between P and ∆ will suffice. Theta serves as an intermediary - a\nparameter whose value we can choose - guided by our sketch of the geometry of our struc\nture. For each value of theta, the above two equations then fix the value of the vertical dis\nplacement and the applied load. A spread sheet is an appropriate tool for carrying out a\nsequence of such calculations and for constructing a graph of the way P varies with ∆,\nwhich is our objective. This is left as an exercise for the reader.\n1.

      "content": "Static Equilibrium Force and Moment\n2.1\nConcept of Force\nEquilibrium of a Particle\nYou are standing in an elevator, ascending at a constant velocity, what is\nthe resultant force acting on you as a particle?\nThe correct response is zero: For a particle at rest, or moving with constant\nvelocity relative to an inertial frame, the resultant force acting on the isolated\nparticle must be zero, must vanish. We usually attribute this to the unquestion\nable authority of Newton.\nThe essential phrases in the question are constant velocity, resultant force and\nparticle. Other words like \"standing\", \"elevator\", \"ascending\", and \"you\" seem\nless important, even distracting, but they are there for a reason: The world that\nyou as an engineer will analyze, re-design, and systematize is filled with people\nand elevators, not isolated particles, velocity vectors, or resultant forces -- or at\nleast, not at first sight. The latter concepts are abstractions which you must learn\nto identify in the world around you in order to work effectively as an engineer,\ne.g., in order to design an elevator. The problems that appear in engineering text\nbooks are a kind of middle ground between abstract theory and everyday reality.\nWe want you to learn to read and see through the superficial appearances, these\ndescriptions which mask certain scientific concepts and principles, in order to\ngrasp and appropriate the underlying forms that provide the basis for engineering\nanalysis and design.\nThe key phrase in Newton's requirement is isolated particle: It is absolutely\nessential that you learn to abstract out of the problem statement and all of its rele\nvant and irrelevant words and phrases, a vision of a particle as a point free in\nspace. It's best to render this vision, this abstraction \"hard\" by drawing it on a\nclean sheet of paper. Here is how it would look.\nR\nAn Isolated Particle:\nW\nYou, in an elevator.\nAn Isolated Particle\nAll Forces Acting\n\nChapter 2\nThis is a non-trivial step, akin to a one month old's apprehension that there are\nother egos in the world. You are to take the dot drawn as the representation of a\nthing, all things, that can be thought of as an isolated particle.\nNow show all the forces acting on the particle. We have the force due to grav\nity, W=Mg, acting vertically down, toward the center of the earth.... (Who said the\nelevator was oriented vertically? Who said it was on the surface of the earth? This\ninformation is not given; indeed, you could press the point, arguing that the ques\ntion is not well posed. But is this information essential? We return to this point at\nthe end of this chapter). We have the reaction force of the elevator floor acting\nvertically upward on you, on you as an abstraction, as an isolated particle. This is\nhow our particle looks with all forces acting upon it.\nThe resultant force is the vector sum of all the forces acting on the isolated\nparticle. For static equilibrium of the isolated particle, the resultant of the two\nforces - W acting downward and R acting upward - must be zero.\n-\nR\nW = 0\nThis leads to the not very earth shaking conclusion that the magnitude of the\nreaction force, acting up, must equal the weight.\nR = W\nThis apparently trivial result and simplicity of the problem, if indeed it can be\ncalled a problem, ought not to be allowed to deceive us: The introduction of the\nreaction of the floor on you, the passenger in the elevator, is characteristic of the\nmost difficult step in applying the requirement of static equilibrium to an isolated\nparticle. You will find it takes courage, as well as facility with the language of\nengineering mechanics, to venture forth and construct reaction forces out of thin\nair. They are there, hidden at the interface of your particle with the rest of the\nworld. Some, like gravity, act at a distance, across all boundaries you may draw.\nExercise 2.1\nEstimate the lift force acting on the wings of a Boeing 747 traveling from\nNew York to Los Angeles during rush hour.\nWe can use the same isolation, or free-body diagram, of the figures above\nwhere now the point represents the Boeing 747, rather than you in an elevator, and\nthe reaction force represents the lift force acting on the airplane, rather than the\nforce acting on you at your interface with the elevator floor. From the requirement\nof static equilibrium, (we implicitly acknowledge that the 747 is moving with con\nstant velocity), we conclude that lift force is equal to the weight, so to estimate the\nlift force we estimate the weight. Constructing this argument is half the problem.\nNow the other half: To estimate the weight we can guess... 100 tons? (More than\n10 tons; we have heard of a 10 ton truck). But perhaps we can do better by slic\ning up the total weight, and try to estimate its ingredients. Passengers: How many\npassengers? I estimate 500. (More than 100, less than 1000). Then\nweight ⁄ passenger ≈250(pounds)\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nwhere I've thrown in an estimate of the weight of passenger luggage. This gives a contri\nbution of\n500 × 250= 125 ⋅ 103(pounds)\nStructural weight: Let's focus on the weight of the fuselage and the weight of\nthe wings... I imagine the fuselage to be a thin, circular cylinder- a tin can, an alu\nminum can, a big aluminum can. How big? How long, what diameter, what thick\nness? I will build up upon my estimate of number of passengers and my memory\nof seating arrangements in the big plane. I estimate 10 or 12 seats across, add\nanother two seats for the two aisles, and taking seat width as two feet, I obtain a\ncylinder diameter of\n14 × 2= 28 ( feet)\nI will round that up to 30 feet. Length: With 14 passengers per row and 500\npassengers on board, and taking row pitch as 3 feet/row, I estimate total row\nlength to be\n3 × 500 ⁄ 14= 100( feet)\nThat seems low. But other spaces must be accounted for. For example, galleys\nand restrooms, (another 40 feet?), and the pilot's compartment, (20 feet), the tail\nsection (20 feet). Altogether then I estimate the length to be 180 feet. Thickness: I\nestimate 1/2 inch. Now I need a density, a weight density. Water is 62.4 pounds\nper cubic foot. The specific gravity of aluminum is what? I guess it to be 8. My\nestimate of fuselage weight is then the volume of the thin cylinder times the\nweight density. The volume is the circumference times the thickness - a good\napproximation when the thickness is small relative to the diameter - times the\nlength. I obtain\n×\n,\nπ × 30 × 180 × ( 1 ⁄ 2) × (1 ft ⁄ 12in) × 8\n≈350 ⋅ 10 3(pounds)\nFlooring and equipment and cosmetic structure will add more. I add another\n20-25% and bring this up to\n420 ⋅ 10 3(pounds)\nThe wings and engines come next: Here again we estimate the volume of wing\nmaterial, now taking the wing as the equivalent of two thin sheets of aluminum.\nWing length, tip to tip, as approximately the fuselage length, 180 feet. Wing\nbreadth, or mean cord length we take as 20 feet, (the wing tapers as you move out\nfrom the fuselage to the tips of the wings) and the thickness again as .5inches. The\nproduct of volume and weight density is then, noting that it take two such sheets\nto make the tip-to-tip wing\n⁄\n×\n,\n2 × 180 × 20 × (1 ⁄ 2) × (1 12\n) × 8\n≈150 ⋅ 10 3(pounds)\n\nChapter 2\nI throw in another 50,000 pounds for the motors and the tail (plus stabilizers)\nand so estimate the total structural weight to be\n620 ⋅ 10 3(pounds)\nFuel: How much does the fuel weigh? The wings hold the fuel. I estimate the\ntotal volume enclosed by the wings to be the wing area times 1 foot. I take the\ndensity of fuel to be the same as water, 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. The total\nweight of the fuel is then estimated to be\n,\n2 × 180 × 20 × 1 ×\n62 4 ≈450 ⋅ 10 3(pounds)\nThis looks too big. I can rationalize a smaller number citing the taper of the\nwing in its thickness as I move from the fuselage out to wing tip. I cut this esti\nmate in half, not knowing anything more than that the tip volume must be near\nzero. So my fuel weight estimate is now\n250 ⋅ 10 3(pounds)\nAll together then I estimate the lift force on a Boeing 747 at rush hour (fully\nloaded) to be\n970 ⋅ 10 3pounds or approximately 500 tons.\nIs this estimate correct? Is it the right answer? Do I get an A? That depends\nupon the criteria used to differentiate right from wrong. Certainly we must allow\nfor more than one numerical answer since there is no one numerical answer. If we\nadmit a range, say of 20% either up or down, I may or may not pass. If we accept\nanything within a factor of 2, I am more confident, even willing to place a bet at 2\nto 1 odds, that I am in the right. But go check it out: Jane's All the World's Air\ncraft will serve as a resource.\nIs the method correct? The criteria here are more certain: In the first place, it is\nessential that I identify the lift force as the weight. Without this conceptual leap,\nwithout an abstraction of the plane as a particle, I am blocked at the start. This is a\nnontrivial and potentially argumentative step. More about that later.\nSecond, my method is more than a guess. It has a rationale, based upon a dis\nsection of the question into pieces - passenger weight, structural weight, fuel\nweight - each of which in turn I might guess. But, again, I can do better: I dissect\nthe passenger weight into a sum of individual weights. Here now I am on firmer\nground, able to construct an estimate more easily and with confidence because an\nindividual's weight is close at hand. So too with the structural and fuel weight; I\nreduce the question to simpler, more familiar terms and quantities. Fuel is like\nwater in weight. The fuselage is a big aluminum can of football field dimensions.\nHere I have made a significant mistake in taking the specific gravity of aluminum as 8, which is that for steel. I\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nought to have halved that factor, better yet, taken it as 3. My total estimate changes but not by a factor of 2. The\nmethod remains correct.\nIs this the only method, the only route to a rational estimate? No. A freshman\nthought of the weight of a school bus, fully loaded with forty passengers, and\nscaled up this piece. A graduate student estimated the lift force directly by consid\nering the change in momentum of the airstream (free stream velocity equal to the\ncruising speed of the 747) as it went over the wing. There are alternative routes to\nfollow in constructing an estimate; there is no unique single right method as there\nis no unique, single right number. This does not mean that there are no wrong\nmethods and estimates or that some methods are not better than others.\nOften you will not be able to develop a feel for the ingredients of an estimate\nor the behavior of a system, often because of a disjunction between the scale of\nthings in your experience and the scale of the problem at hand. If that be the case,\ntry to breakdown the system into pieces of a more familiar scale, building an asso\nciation with things you do have some feel for. More seriously, the dictates of the\nfundamental principles of static equilibrium might run counter to your expecta\ntions. If this is the case, stick with it. In time what at first seems counter-intuitive\nwill become familiar.\nExercise 2.2\nWhat do you need to know to determine the force in cables AB and BC?\nW\nA\nC\nB\n- You need to know that the cables support only tension. A cable is not able\nto support compression nor does it offer any resistance to bending. Web-\nster's New Collegiate Dictionary notes the \"great tensile strength\" of a\ncable but says nothing about bending or compression. The cable's inability\nto support other than tension is critical to our understanding, our vocabu\nlary. Bending itself will require definition... in time.\n- You need to know the weight of the block.\n- You need to know the angles AB and BC each make with the horizontal.\n(I will call them ΘA and Θ B). That's what you need to know.\n\nChapter 2\n- You also must know how to isolate the system as a particle and you\nmust know the laws of static equilibrium for an isolated particle.\n- Less apparent, you must presume that the force on the block due to grav\nity acts vertically downward -- the convention in this textbook.\nThat is the answer to this need to know problem.\nNow, you might ask me how do I know when to stop; how do I know when I\ndon't need to know anymore? For example, how do I know I don't need to know\nthe length of the cables or what material they are made from?\nI know from solving this kind of problem before; you will learn when to stop in\nthe same way - by working similar problems. I know too that the materials and\nlengths of the cables can be essential ingredients in the response to other ques\ntions about this simple system...e.g., if I were to ask How much does the point B\ndrop when the block is hooked up to the cables? But that question wasn't asked.\nPerhaps the best way to decide if you know enough is to try to solve the prob\nlem, to construct an answer to the question. Thus:\nExercise 2.3\nShow that the forces in cable AB and BC are given by\nFC = W cos θA ⁄ sin (θA + θC )\nand\nF A = W cos θC ⁄ sin (θA + θC )\nWe first isolate the system, making it a particle. Point B, where the line of\naction of the weight vector intersects with the lines of action of the tensions in the\ncables becomes our particle.\nThe three force vectors FA, FC and\nW then must sum to zero for static\nθC\nθA\nFA\nx\ny\nFC\nequilibrium. Or again, the resultant\nforce on the isolated particle must\nvanish. We meet this condition on the\nvector sum by insisting that two scalar\nsums - the sum of the horizontal (or x)\ncomponents and the sum of the verti\ncal (or y) components - vanish inde-\nW\npendently. For the sum of the x\ncomponents we have, taking positive x as positive:\n-F Acos θA + FCcos θC = 0\nand for the sum of the y components,\nF Asin θA + FCsin θC - W = 0\nA bit of conventional syntax is illustrated here in setting the sums to zero\nrather than doing otherwise, i.e., in the second equation, setting the sum of the two\nvertical components of the forces in the cables equal to the weight. Ignoring this\napparently trivial convention can lead to disastrous results, at least early on in\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nlearning one's way in Engineering Mechanics. The convention brings to the fore\nthe necessity of isolating a particle before applying the equilibrium requirement.\nWe see that what we need to know to determine the force in cable AB and in\ncable BC are the angles θA and θC and the weight of the block, W. These are the\ngivens; the magnitudes of the two forces, FA and FC are our two scalar unknowns.\nWe read the above then as two scalar equations in two scalar unknowns. We have\nreduced the problem ... show that... to a task in elementary algebra.\nTo proceed\nrequires a certain versatility in this more rarefied language.\nThere are various ways to proceed at this point. I can multiply the first equa\ntion by sinθA, the second by cosθA and add the two to obtain\nFC ⋅(sin θA ⋅ cos θC + sin θC ⋅ cos θA ) = W cos θA\nMaking use of an appropriate trigonometric identity, we can write:1\nFC = W ⋅ cos θA ⁄ sin (θA + θC )\nSimilarly, we find:\nF A = W ⋅ cos θC ⁄ sin (θA + θC )\nAnd thus we have shown what was asked to be shown. We have an answer, a\nunique answer in the sense that it is the only acceptable answer to the problem as\nstated, an answer that would merit full credit. But it is also an answer that has\nsome depth, richness, a thick answer in that we can go beyond show that to show\nand tell and tease out of our result several interesting features.\n- First, note that the derived equations are dimensionally correct. Both sides\nhave the same units, that of force (or ML/T2). In fact, we could easily\nobtain non-dimensional expressions for the cable tensions by dividing by\nthe weight W. This linear relationship between the unknown forces in the\ncables and the applied load W will characterize most all of our discourse.\nIt is a critical feature of our work in that it simplifies our task: If your boss\nasks you what will happen if some idiot accidentally doubles the weight\nhanging from the cables, you simply respond that the tensions in the\ncables will double.As always, there are caveats: We must assure ourselves first that the\ncables do not deform to any significant degree under double the weight. If they do then the\nangle θA and θC might change so a factor of 2.0 might not be quite exact. Of course if the\ncables break all bets are off.\n1. This is an example of textbook rhetoric cryptically indicating a skipped step in the analysis. The author's pre\nsumption is that you, the reader, can easily recognize what's been left out. The problem is that it takes time,\nsometimes a long time, to figure out the missing step, certainly more time than it takes to read the sentence. If\nyou are befuddled, an appropriate response then is to take some time out to verify the step.\n\nChapter 2\n- Second, note that the more vertically oriented of the two cables, the cable\nwith its θ closer to a right angle, experiences the greater of the two ten\nsions; we say it carries the greatest load.\n- Third, note that the tension in the cables can be greater than the weight of\nthe suspended body. The denominator sin(θA + θC) can become very small,\napproaching zero as the sum of the two angles approaches zero. The\nnumerators, on the other hand, remain finite; cosθ approaches 1.0 as θ\napproaches 0. Indeed, the maximum tension can become a factor of 10 or\n100 or 1000... whatever you like... times the weight.\n- Fourth, note the symmetry of the system when θA is set equal to θC. In this\ncase the tensions in the two cables are equal, a result you might have\nguessed, or should have been able to claim, from looking at the figure with\nthe angles set equal.2\n- Fifth, if both angles approach a right angle, i.e., θA →π/2 and θC→π/2,\nwe have the opportunity to use \"L'Hospital's rule\". In this case we\nhave\nFC = F A =\nlim (W cos θ ⁄ sin 2θ) =\nlim (-W sin θ ⁄ 2 cos 2θ) = W ⁄ 2\nθ →π ⁄ 2\nθ →π ⁄ 2\nso each cable picks up half the weight.\nOther observations are possible: What if one of the angles is negative? What if\na bird sits on a telephone wire? Or we might consider the graphical representation\nof the three vectors in equilibrium, as in the following:\nThe figure below shows how you can proceed from knowing magnitude and\ndirection of the weight vector and the directions of the lines of action of the forces\nin the two cables to full knowledge of the cable force vectors, i.e., their magni\ntudes as well as directions. The figure in the middle shows the directions of the\nlines of action of the two cable forces but the line of action of the force in cable\nAB, inclined at an angle θA to the horizontal, has been displaced downward.\nFA\nFC\nW\nW\nθA\nθA\nθC\nθC\nW\n2. Buridan, a medieval scholar in Mechanics would have cited the Principle of Sufficient Reason in explaining\nhow the forces must be equal for the symmetric configuration. There is no reason why one or the other cable\ntensions should be greater or less than the other. Buridan's ass, confronting two symmetrically placed bales\nof hay in front of his nose, starved to death. There was no sufficient reason to go left or right, so the story\ngoes.\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nThe figure at the far right shows the vectors summing to zero, that is, in vector\nnotation we have:\nFA + FC + W = 0\nWhile the two scalar equations previously derived in answering the show that\nchallenge do not spring immediately from the figure, the relative magnitudes of\nthe cable tensions are clearly shown in the figure at the far right.\n- Graphical and algebraic, or analytic, constructions and readings of prob\nlems are complementary. Both should be pursued if possible; beyond two\ndimensions, however, graphical interpretations are difficult.\n- Finally, note how the problem would have differed if the weight W and the\nangles θ and θC were stated as numbers, e.g., 100 pounds, 30 degrees, 60\nA\ndegrees. The setting-up of the problem would have gone much the same\nbut the solution would be thin soup indeed - two numbers, 50 pounds and\n87.6 pounds, and that's about it; no opportunity for real thought, no occa\nsion for learning about medieval scholars thoughts about sufficient reason\ning, for conjecturing about birds on telegraph wires or applying\nL'Hospital's rule; it would be an exercise meriting little more than the\ncrankings of a computer.\nResultant Force\nWe have used the phrase resultant in stating the requirement for static equilib\nrium of an isolated particle - the resultant of all forces acting on the isolated par\nticle must vanish. Often we use resultant to mean the vector sum of a subset of\nforces acting on a particle or body, rather than the vector sum of all such forces.\nFor example, we can say \"the resultant of the two cable tensions, F\nand FC acting\nA\nat point B in Exercise 2.3 is the force vector -W\". The resultant is constructed\nusing the so called parallelogram law for vector addition as illustrated in the fig\nure. F\n+ F\ncan then be read as -W, the vector equal in magnitude to the weight\nA\nC\nvector W but oppositely directed.\nθC\nW\nW\nW\nFC\nFA + FC\nθA\nFA\n= - W\n\ni\nChapter 2\nWe can also speak of a single force\nF x\nF z .\nF\ny\nz\nk\nvector as being the resultant of its compo\nnents, usually its three mutually perpen\nj\ndicular\n(or\northogonal)\nrectangular,\ncartesian components. In the figure, the\nvector F has components F , F\nand F .\nx\ny\nz\nThe latter three mutually perpendicular\nvectors are usefully written as the product\nx\nof a scalar magnitude and a unit vector\nF y\nindicating the direction of the vector com\nponent. The three unit vectors are often indicated by i, j and k and that is the con\nvention we will follow in this text.\nThe vector resultant or sum can be written out as\n=\nF\nFx + Fy + Fz\nor, equivalently\nF = F i + Fy j + F k\nx\nz\nNote the convention for designating a vector quantity using bold face. This is\nthe convention we follow in the text. In lecture it is difficult to write with chalk in\nbold face. It is also difficult for you to do so on your homework and exams. In\nthese instances we will use the convention of placing a bar (or twiddle) over or\nunder the letter to indicate it is a vector quantity.\nExercise 2.4\nFor each of the three force systems shown below, estimate the magnitude of\nthe resultant, of F1 and F . What is the direction of the resultant in each\ncase?\nF1\nF1\nF2\nF2\nθ\nθ\nθ\nF1\nF2\nθ\nθ\n10N\n10N\n10N\n10N\n10N\n10N\nθ\nFor the force system at the left, the vertical component of the resultant force\nmust be zero since the vertical components of the two forces are equal but one is\npositive (upward) and the other negative (downward). The symmetry with respect\nto the horizontal also leads to the result that the horizontal component of the\nresultant will be the sum of the two (equal) horizontal components of the two\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nforces. I estimate this sum to be 8 Newtons since the angle θ looks to be something\nless than 30o. The resultant is directed horizontally to the right.\nFor the system in the middle, the resultant is zero since the two forces are\nequal but oppositely directed. If we were concerned with the static equilibrium of\nthese three systems, only this system would be in equilibrium.\nF1\nF2\nθ\nθ\n~ (2 *4N)\nF1\nF2\nθ\n~ (2 *8 or9N)\nF = F1 + F2\nθ\nF = F1 + F2\nFor the system at the far right, with the two forces symmetric with respect to\nthe vertical, we now have that the horizontal component of the resultant force\nmust be zero while the vertical component of the resultant will be the sum of the\ntwo (equal) vertical components of the two forces. I estimate this sum to be 16 ~\n18 Newtons. The resultant is directed vertically upward as shown above.\nFriction Force\nOften the greatest challenges in applying the requirements of static equilibrium\nto useful purpose is isolating the particle (or later the body) and showing on your\nisolation, your free-body diagram, all the forces (and later all the torques as well)\nthat act. These include reaction forces as well as forces applied like the weight\ndue to gravity. Imagining and drawing these forces takes a certain facility in the\ncreative use of the language of Engineering Mechanics, in particular, a facility\nwith the characteristics of different kinds of forces. One of the kinds you will be\nresponsible for reading out of a problem statement and writing into your free-body\ndiagram is the force due to friction.\nFriction is tricky because sometimes it can be anything it needs to be; it's\ndirection as well as magnitude have a chameleon quality, taking on the colors that\nbest meet the requirements of static equilibrium. But it can only be so big; it's\nmagnitude is limited. And when things begin to move and slide, it's something\nelse again. Friction is even more complicated in that its magnitude depends upon\nthe surface materials which are in contact at the interface you have constructed in\nyour free-body diagram but not upon the area in contact. This means that you have\nto go to a table in a reference book, ask a classmate, or call up a supplier, to obtain\nan appropriate value for the coefficient of friction.\n\nChapter 2\nConsider the following illustration\nof the practical implications of friction\nBlock\nA\nand the laws of static equilibrium: I\nB\nθ\nknow from experience that my back\ngoes out if I pull on a cable angling up\nfrom the ground with a certain force,\napproximately fifty pounds. Will my\nback go out if I try to drag the heavy\nblock shown by pulling on the cable AB?\nTo find the force I must exert, through the cable, onto the block in order to\nslide it to the right I will isolate the block and apply the laws of static equilibrium.\nNow this, at first reading, might appear a contradiction: How can the block be\nsliding to the right and in static equilibrium at the same time?\nTwo responses are possible:\n- If the block is sliding to the right at constant velocity, then the laws of\nstatic equilibrium still apply - as when you ascended in an elevator at con\nstant velocity. There is no contradiction.\n- If the block does not move, but is just about to move, then the laws of\nstatic equilibrium still apply and again there is no contradiction. In this\ncase we say we are at the point of impending motion; the smallest incre\nment in the force with which I pull on the cable will start the block sliding\nto the right.\nIt is the second case that I will analyze, that of impending motion. It is this\ncase that will most likely throw my back out.\nI first isolate the block as a particle, showing all the applied and reaction forces\nacting upon it. The weight, W, and the force with which I pull the cable AB-- I\nwill call it FA-- are the applied forces.\nThe reaction forces include the force of the\nFA\nground pushing up on the block, N, what is called\nFf\na normal force, and the friction force, Ff, acting\nθ\nparallel to the plane of contact of the block with\nthe ground, tending to resist motion to the right,\nN\nhence acting on the block to the left. For static\nequilibrium the resultant force on the particle\nW\nmust vanish. Again, this is equivalent to demand\ning that the sum of the horizontal components and the sum of the vertical compo\nnents vanish independently.\nThus:\nF Acos θ - F f = 0\nand\nF Asin θ + N - W = 0\nThese are two scalar equations. But look, there are at least three unknowns -\nF , FA and N and θ. Even if θ is given, say 60o, we are still in a fix since there\nf\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nremains one more unknown over the number of independent equations available.\nNow it's not that we can't find a solution; indeed we can find any number of sets\nof the three unknowns that serve: Just pick a value for any one of the three - FA,\nFf, or N as some fraction of W, say W/2, and use the equilibrium equations to\nsolve for the remaining two. The problem is we can not find a unique solution. We\nsay that system is under determined, or indeterminate.\nThis is where impending motion comes to our rescue. We add the condition\nthat we are at the point of impending motion. At impending motion the frictional\nforce is related to the normal force by\nF f = μ ⋅ N\nwhere μ is called the coefficient of static friction.\nNote that μ is a dimensionless quantity since both the normal force N and its\nassociated friction force Ff have the same dimensions, that of force. The particular\nvalue of the coefficient of static friction depends upon the materials in contact at\nthe interface where the friction force acts. Another coefficient of friction is defined to cover the\ncase of sliding at constant velocity. It is labeled the coefficient of sliding friction. It too depends upon the charac\nter of the materials in contact; it's value is nominally less than μ.\nThis is the third equation that allows us to estimate the force that will throw\nmy back out. In fact, solving the three equations we find:\nF A = μ ⋅ W ⁄ (cos θ + μ ⋅ sin θ)\nFrom this expression I can estimate the weight of the block I might be able to\nmove by pulling on the cable AB. For example, if θ = 60o and I take μ = 0.25, as\nan estimate for sliding blocks along the ground, then setting FA = 50 lb. -- an esti\nmate of the maximum force I can exert without disastrous results -- and solving\nfor W, I find from the above\nW = 143.3 lb.\nThe friction force at impending motion is in this case, from the first equation\nof equilibrium,\nF f = F Acos θ = 50 ⋅ cos 60o = 25 lb.\nIf I pull with a force less than fifty pounds, say twenty pounds, still at an angle\nof 60o, on a block weighing 143.3 pounds or more, the block will not budge. The\nfriction force Ff is just what it needs to be to satisfy equilibrium, namely Ff= 20\ncos 60o = 10 lb. This is what was meant by the statement \" ... can be anything it\nhas to be.\" The block in this case does not move, nor is it just about to move. As I\nincrease the force with which I pull, say from twenty to fifty pounds, the frictional\nforce increases proportionally from ten to twenty-five pounds, at which point the\nblock begins to move and we leave the land of Static Equilibrium. That's okay; I\nknow now what weight block I can expect to be able to drag along the ground\nwithout injury. I need go no further.\n\nChapter 2\nBut wait! What, you say, if I push\ninstead of pull the block? Won't pushing\nFB\nbe easier on my back? You have a point:\nθ\nI will now analyze the situation given that\nFf\nthe AB is no longer a cable which I pull\nbut signifies my arms pushing. In this we\nkeep θ equal to 60o .\nN\nAt first glance, you might be tempted\nas I was, when I was a youth with a good\nW\nback but little facility in speaking Engi\nneering Mechanics, to simply change the sign of FA in the equilibrium equations\nand let it go at that: Solving would simply change the sign in our final expression\nfor FA in terms of W. But that will not do.\nFriction is trickier: Friction always acts in a direction resisting the impend\ning motion. Here is another way it changes its colors to suit the context. No, I\ncan't get away so simply; I must redraw my free-body diagram carefully showing\nthe new directions of the forces FA and Ff. In this I will label the force I apply, FB\nEquilibrium now gives, taking horizontal components to be positive when\ndirected to the right and vertical components positive when directed upward:\n- FBcos θ + F f = 0\nand\n-FBsin θ + N\nW\n\n= 0\n-\nThese two, again supplemented by the relationship between the friction force\nand the normal force, namely\nF f = μ ⋅ N\nnow yield\nFB = μ ⋅ W ⁄ (cos θ - μ ⋅ sin θ)\nThis is the force I must push with in order to just start the block sliding to the\nleft - a state of impending motion. If I push with a force less than this, the block\nwill not budge, the friction force is whatever the first equilibrium equation says it\nhas to be. What force must I push with in order to move a block of weight W =\n143.3 lb? Again, with θ = 60o, the above expression gives FB = 126.3 lb.\nNote well the result! I must push with more than twice the force I must pull\nwith in order to move the block! There is no mystery here. The reasons for this are\nall contained in the equations of equilibrium and the rules we have laid out which\ngovern the magnitude and direction of the force due to friction. It is the latter that\nadds so much spice to our story. Note, I might go on and construct a story about\nhow pushing down at an angle adds to the normal force of reaction which in turn\nimplies that the frictional force resisting motion at the point of impending motion\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nwill increase.\nThe bottom line is that it takes more force to push and start the\nblock moving than to pull and do the same.\nExercise 2.5\nProfessor X, well known for his lecturing theatrics, has thought of an inno\nvative way to introduce his students to the concept of friction, in particular\nto the notion of impending motion. His scheme is as follows: He will place\na chair upon the top of the table, which is always there at the front of the\nlecture hall, and ask for a volunteer from the class to mount the table and\nsit down in the chair. Other volunteers will then be instructed to slowly\nraise the end of the table. Students in the front row will be asked to estimate\nthe angle φ as it slowly increases and to make a note of the value when the\nchair, with the student on board, begins to slide down the table surface,\nnow a ramp.\nUnfortunately, instead of sliding, the chair tips, the student lurches forward,\nfractures his right arm in attempting to cushion his fall, gets an A in the course,\nand sues the University. Reconstruct what Professor X was attempting to demon\nstrate and the probable cause of failure of the demonstration?\n-\nφ\nI begin by drawing a free-body diagram, isolating the student and the chair\ntogether - all that which will slide down the table top when tipped up - as a parti\ncle. The weight W in the figure below is the weight of the student and the chair.\nThe reaction force at the interface of the chair with the table is represented by two\nperpendicular components, the normal force N and the friction force Ff. We now\nrequire that the resultant force on the particle vanish.\nx\ny\nφ\nφ\nW\nFf\nN\n\nChapter 2\nIn this, we choose the x-y axes shown as a reference frame. We make this\nchoice to simplify our analysis. Only the weight vector W has both x and y compo\nnents. Make a mental note of this way of crafting in setting up a problem. It is a\nbit of nuance of language use that can help you express your thoughts more effi\nciently than otherwise and yield a rich return, for example, on a quiz when time is\nprecious. Equilibrium in the x direction, positive down the plane, then requires\n-F f + W ⋅ sin φ = 0\nwhile equilibrium in the y direction yields\n-\nN\nW\n\n⋅ cos φ = 0\nI manipulate these to obtain\nF f = N tan φ\nwhere\nN = W ⋅ cos φ\nNow we know from the previous friction problem we analyzed that the friction\nforce can only get so large relative to the normal force before motion will ensue.\nFor the problem at hand, once the ratio of friction force to normal force reaches a\nvalue equal to the coefficient of static friction, μ, appropriate for the chair's leg\ntips interfacing with the material of the table's top, motion of the \"particle\" down\nthe plane will follow. We can state this condition as an inequality. The student and\nchair will not slide down the plane as long as\nF f = N ⋅ tan φ < μ ⋅ N\nThis immediately yields the conclusion that as long as the angle φ is less than a\ncertain value, namely if\ntan φ μ\n<\nthe particle will not move. Note that, on the basis of this one-to-one relationship, we could\ndefine the condition of impending motion between two materials in terms of the value of\nthe angle φ as easily as in terms of μ . For this reason, φ is sometimes called the friction\nangle. For example, if μ = 0.25 then the angle at which the chair and student will begin to\nslide is φ = 14o Note, too, that our result is independent of the weights of the student and\nthe chair. All students should begin to slide down the plane at the same angle. This was to\nbe a central point in Professor X's demonstration: He planned to have a variety of students\ntake a slide down the table top. Unfortunately the tallest person in class volunteered to go\nfirst.\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nWhy did the demonstration fail?\nIt failed\nbecause Professor X saw a particle where he\nshould have envisioned an extended body. The\nfigure at the below is an adaptation of a sketch\ndrawn by a student in the front row just at the\ninstant before the student and chair tipped for\nward. Note that the line of action of the weight\nvector of the chair-student combination, which\nI have added to the student's sketch, passes\nthrough the point of contact of the front legs of the chair with the table top, point\nW\n-B\nφ=10ο\nB. Note, too, that the angle φ is less than the friction angle, less than the value at\nwhich the chair would begin to slide.\nIn the next instant, as the students charged with lifting the left end of the table\ndid as they were told and raised their end up an inch, the line of action of W fell\nforward of point B and the accident ensued.\nWhen is a particle a particle?\nThe question perhaps is better phrased as \"When is a body a particle?\" The last\nexercise brings forcibly home how you can go wrong if you mistakenly read a par\nticle where you ought to imagine something of more substance. We have here a\nfailure in modeling.\nModeling is a process that requires you to represent \"reality\" in the language\nof Engineering Mechanics, to see in the world (or in the text in front of you) the\nconceptual ingredients of force, now of torque or moment and how the laws of\nstatic equilibrium and subsidiary relations like those that describe the action of a\nforce due to friction, are to apply. It was Professor X's failure to see the tipping\nmoment about point B that led to his, rather the student's, downfall.\nModeling failures are common, like the cold. And there is no easy fix nor med\nicine to prescribe that will ensure 100% success in modeling. One thing is essen\ntial, at least here at the start: You must draw an isolation, a free-body diagram, as\na first, critical step in your response to a problem. That until now, has meant, not\njust drawing a point on a clean sheet of paper - anyone can do that - but that you\nimagine all the force vectors acting on the particle and draw them too on your\nsheet of paper.\nThis requires some thought. You must imagine; you must take risks; you must\nconjecture and test out your conjecture. In this you have available the beginnings\nof a vocabulary and some grammar to help you construct an appropriate isolation\nof, at least, a particle:\n- gravity acts downward;\n- friction force acts to resist motion;\n- the normal force acts perpendicular to the plane of contact;\n- a cable can only sustain a tensile force;\n\nChapter 2\n- to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\nTo these notions we can add:\n- it doesn't matter where you show a force vector acting along its line-of-\naction;3\n- you are free to choose the orientation of a reference coordinate system;\n- the requirement that the resultant force of all the forces acting on an iso\nlated particle vanish is equivalent to requiring that the sums of the usually\northogonal, scalar components of all the forces vanish.\nKnowing all of this, there remains ample room for error and going astray. Pro\nfessor X's free-body diagram and analysis of a particle were well done. The failing\nwas in the field of view right at the outset; Modeling a student in a chair on an\ninclined plane as a particle was wrong from the start.\nNow this really makes life difficult since, for some purposes, the chair and stu\ndent might be successfully modeled as a particle, e.g., if the coefficient of friction\nis sufficiently small such that I need not worry about the tipping forward, (see\nproblem 2.12), while at other times this will not do. Or consider the block I pull\nalong the ground in section 2.1.3: I successfully modeled the block as a particle\nthere. Note how, at this point, you might now conjecture a scenario in which I\ncould not claim success, for example, if the geometry were such that the block\nwould lift off the ground before sliding. Or consider the airplane of Exercise 2.1.\nIf I am interested in the resultant lift force, I can get away with modeling the foot-\nball-field size machine as a particle; on the other hand, if I were responsible for\ndefining how to set the flaps to maintain a specified attitude of the craft, I would\nhave to take the airplane as an extended body and worry about the distribution of\nthe lift force over the wings and the horizontal stabilizer.\nWe conclude that the chair and student, indeed all things of the world of Engi\nneering Mechanics, do not appear in the world with labels that say \"I am a parti-\ncle\" or \"I am not a particle\". No, it is you who must provide the labels, read the\nsituation, then articulate and compose an abstract representation or model that will\nserve. In short, something might be a particle or it might be an extended body\ndepending upon your interests, what questions you raise, or are raised by others\nfor you to answer.\nNow, in most texts whether something is a particle or a body can be easily\nimputed from the context of the problem. You expect to find only particles in a\nchapter on \"Static Equilibrium of a Particle\". On the other hand, if an object is\ndimensioned, i.e., length, width and height are given on the figure, you can be\nquite sure that you're meant to see an extended body. This is an usually unstated\nrule of textbook writing - authors provide all the information required to solve the\nproblem and no more. To provide more, or less, than what's required is consid\nered, if not a dirty trick, not in good form. I will often violate this norm. Engi\n3. This is true as long as we are not concerned with what goes on within the boundary we have drawn enclosing\nour free body.\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nneers, in their work, must deal with situations in which there is an excess of\ninformation while, at other times, situations in which there is insufficient informa\ntion and conjecture and estimation is necessary. It's best you learn straight off a\nbit more about the real world than the traditional text allows.\n2.2\nConcept of Moment\nForce is not enough. You know from your studies in physics of the dynamics of\nbodies other than particles, that you must speak about their rotation as well as\ntranslation through space; about how they twist and turn.\nEquilibrium of a Body\nWe turn, then, to consider what we can say about forces, applied and reactive,\nwhen confronted with a body that cannot be seen as a particle but must be taken as\nhaving finite dimensions, as an extended body. Crucial to our progress will be the\nconcept of moment or torque which can be interpreted as the turning effect of a\nforce.\nWe start again with a block on the ground. Instead of pushing or pulling, we\nexplore what we can do with a lever. In particular we pose, as did Galileo (who\nalso had a bad back),\nExercise 2.6\nEstimate the magnitude of the force I must exert with my foot pressing down\nat B to just lift the end of the block at A up off the ground?\nWe isolate the system, this time as an extended body, showing all the applied\nand reaction forces acting on the system. The applied forces are the weight acting\ndownward along a vertical line of action passing through the c.g., the center of\n\nChapter 2\ngravity of the block, and the force of my foot acting downward along a line of\naction through the point B at the right end of the lever AB.\nxCB\nxED\nxDA xAC\nFB\nFC\nW\nFE\nE\nC\nB\nD\nA\nThe reaction forces are two: (1) the force of the ground acting up on the left\nend of the block at E and (2), the force of the ground acting up through the pivot at\nC upon the lever AB. Our quest is to determine the magnitude of the (vertical)\nforce we must apply at B in order to just lift the end A off the ground. We start by\napplying our known requirement for static equilibrium - for a body at rest, or\nmoving with constant velocity, the resultant force acting on the isolated body\nmust be zero, must vanish. We have, taking up as positive,\nFE - W\nFC - FB = 0\n+\nWe read this as one (scalar) equation with three unknowns, the applied force FB\nand the two reactions FE and FC. Clearly we need to say something more. That\n\"more\" is contained in the following equilibrium requirement for an extended\nbody - for a body at rest, or moving with constant velocity, the resultant\nmoment of all forces acting on the isolated body must be zero, must vanish. I\nwill find the resultant moment or torque of all the forces about the left-most point\nE. I will take as positive, a torque which tends to rotate the extended body of\nblock and lever - all that lies within the dotted envelope - clockwise. For exam\nple, the moment about point E of the reaction force FC is negative since it tends to\nrotate the system counter-clockwise about the reference point E. Its value is given\nby (xED+xDA+xAC) FC, the product of the force FC and the perpendicular distance\nfrom the point E to the line of action of the force FC.\nThe resultant moment of all the forces acting on the isolated system is\nxED ⋅ W - (xED + xDA + xAC) ⋅ FC + (xED + xDA + xAC + xCB) ⋅ F B = 0\nWe may read this equation as a second scalar equation in terms of the three\nunknown force quantities if we take the x's, the distance measures, as known. We\nmight, at this point, estimate the distances: the block length looks to be about one\nmeter.4 Then, from the figure, estimate the other lengths by measuring their mag\nnitudes relative to the length of the block. I will not do this. Instead, for reasons\nthat will become evident, I will not state the block length but simply label it L\nthen figure the x's in terms of L.\n4. A better estimate might be obtained if the reader could identify the shrub at the left of the block. But that's\nbeyond the scope of the course.\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nMy estimates for the lengths are then:\nxED = xDA = L ⁄ 2\nxAC = L ⁄ 5\nxBC = 7L ⁄ 5\nWith these, my equation of moment equilibrium becomes\n(L ⁄ 2) ⋅ W - (6L ⁄ 5) ⋅ F C + (13L ⁄ 5) ⋅ FB = 0\nNow make note of one feature. L, the length of the block is a common factor; it\nmay be extracted from each term, then \"cancelled out\" of the equation. We are left\nwith\n⁄\n(W ⁄ 2)-(6 5) ⋅ FC + (13 ⁄ 5) ⋅ F B = 0\nWhere do we stand now? We have two equations but still three unknowns. We\nare algebraically speaking \"up a creek\" if our objective is to find some one, useful\nmeasure of the force we must exert at B to just lift the block of weight W off the\nground at the end A. Again, it's not that we cannot produce a solution for FB in\nterms of W; the problem is we can construct many solutions, too many solutions,\nindeed, an infinite number of solutions. It appears that the problem is indetermi\nnate.\nIn the next chapter we are going to encounter problems where satisfying the\nequilibrium requirements, while necessary, is not sufficient to fixing a solution to\na problem in Engineering Mechanics. There we will turn and consider another\nvital phenomenon - the deformation of bodies. At first glance we might conclude\nthat the problem before us now is of this type, is statically indeterminate. That is\nnot the case. Watch!\nI will dissect my extended body, isolating a\nportion of it, namely the block alone. My free-\nbody diagram is as follows:\nI have constructed a new force FA, an inter\nnal force, which, from the point of view of the\nblock, is the force exerted by the end of the\nlever at A upon the block. Now this extended\nbody, this subsystem is also in static equilib\nrium. Hence I can write\nL/2\nL/2\nFA\nW\nFE\n+\nFE - W\nF A = 0\nensuring force equilibrium and\nW ⋅(L ⁄ 2) - F A ⋅ L = 0\nensuring moment\nequilibrium about point E. The second equation gives us directly F A = W ⁄ 2\nwhile the first then yields FE = F A = W ⁄ 2 which we might have concluded from the\nsymmetry of our free-body diagram5. My next move is to construct yet another isolated\nbody, this time of the lever alone.\n5. Perceiving this symmetry depends upon knowing about the requirement of moment equilibrium of an iso\nlated body so it's a bit unfair to suggest you might have been able to \"see\" this symmetry without this knowl\nedge.\n\nL/5\nChapter 2\nNote that the force acting on the lever due to the\nFB\nblock is the equal and opposite internal reac\ntion FA whose magnitude we now know. This is\nan essential observation. Now this extended\n(7L/5)\nbody, this subsystem is also in static equilib\nrium. Hence I can write\nFA\nFC\n-W ⁄ 2 + FC - FB = 0\nensuring force equilibrium and\n-(L ⁄ 5) ⋅ W ⁄ 2 + ((7L) ⁄ 5) ⋅ F B = 0\nensuring moment equilibrium about point C. Note the repetition in language here and with\nthat of the analysis of the free-body diagram of the block alone. Indeed, once we have con\nstructed the abstract representation, the free-body diagram, the subject matter becomes\nsomewhat boring and repetitive, machine-like. From the second equation, that of moment\nequilibrium, I find\nFB = W ⁄ 14\nwhich is a significant mechanical advantage.\n- Observe that if I had taken moments about point A shown in the free-body\ndiagram of the lever, I would have obtained a different equation expressing\nmoment equilibrium namely, -(L ⁄ 5) ⋅ F C + ((8L) ⁄ 5) ⋅ FB = 0\n- but I would obtain the same result, the same answer. However, I would\nhave to make use of the equation of force equilibrium together with this\nlast equation of moment equilibrium to get to the answer. This feature of\nthis particular problem may be generalized, to wit: It doesn't matter\nwhat point in space you choose as a reference point when you con\nstruct an equation of moment equilibrium. This is powerful knowledge\nthat may dramatically increase your productivity for often, by judicious\nchoice of a reference point, you can simplify your analysis.\n- Observe too that in all three isolations the forces were read as planar and\nparallel, that is their lines of action were drawn in a single plane and paral\nlel to the vertical. In each of the three cases, for each isolation, we wrote\nout two independent, scalar equations; one expressed force equilibrium in\nthe vertical direction, the other moment equilibrium about some reference\npoint. Now I could have, instead of force equilibrium, applied moment\nequilibrium again, about some other reference point. For example, for the\nlever, the last isolation diagram constructed, if I take moment equilibrium\nabout the left end, this, together with the consequence of moment equilib\nrium about point C, namely FB = W ⁄ 14 produces the same result for\nthe reaction at C. Check it out.\n- Observe that at a point early on in our analysis we might have concluded\nthat we had insufficient information to do the problem. But, by breaking\ndown the problem into two other problems we found our way to a solu\ntion.\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\n- Observe, finally, that, after having analyzed the block as an isolated sub\nsystem and obtained the reaction force, FE, we could have gone directly\nback to the original three equations of equilibrium and solved for the\nremaining two unknowns, FC and FB. Once again we note that there are\nalternative paths to a solution. Some paths are more direct than others;\nsome are more enlightening than others, but they all should lead to the\nsame solution if the question is well-posed.\nWe begin to see now the more subtle aspects of applying the requirements of\nstatic equilibrium to useful purpose: Effective use of this new language will\nrequire us to make choices - choices of reference points for taking moments,\nselection of subsystems to analyze when one free-body diagram won't yield all we\nneed to know - and requires a familiarity with different renderings of force and\nmoment equilibrium. There is no unique, cook-book, 100% sure method to solving\nproblems, even statics problems, in Engineering Mechanics.\nDifferent Kinds of Systems of Forces\nThe requirements of force equilibrium and moment equilibrium are two vector\nequations. We can write them as:\n∑Fi = 0\n∑Mi = 0\nIn these two vector equations, the summation is to be carried out over all forces\nand moments acting on an isolated body-- the i ranges over one to N forces say.\nWe can interpret the first as the resultant of all externally applied forces and the\nsecond as the resultant moment of all the forces (and other, concentrated moments\nor couples, yet to be defined) acting on the body.\nThe resultant force on a particle or body and the resultant moment are both\nvector quantities; each has a magnitude and a direction which must be specified to\nfully know the nature of the beast. Each vector resultant has three (3) scalar com\nponents in three-dimensional space so each vector equation is equivalent to three\nindependent scalar equations. From this we conclude:\n- There are at most six (6) independent scalar equations available\n(which must be satisfied) to ensure static equilibrium of an isolated\nbody. For a particle, there are at most three (3) independent scalar\nequations available.\nIf you look back over the exercises we have worked in the preceding sections\nof this text you will note: - estimating the lift force on an aircraft required citing a\nsingle scalar equation; in pulling and pushing the block along the ground, with the\nblock taken as a particle, we made use of two scalar equations; so too, our analysis\nof a particle sliding down a plane required the use of two scalar equations of equi\nlibrium. Nowhere did we need three scalar equations of equilibrium. The reason?\nAll force vectors in each of these particle problems lay in the plane of the page\nhence each had but two scalar components, two x,y or, in some cases, horizontal,\nvertical components. Likewise the resultant force shows but two scalar compo\n\nChapter 2\nnents. Force equilibrium is equivalent to setting the sum of the x components and\nthe sum of the y components to zero. Alternatively we could say that force equi\nlibrium in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the page is identically satis\nfied; 0 = 0; since there are no components in this direction.\nIn our analysis of an extended body, the block with lever applied, we had six\nscalar equations available, at most. Yet in each of the three isolations we con\nstructed we wrote but two independent scalar equations and that was sufficient to\nour purpose. How do we explain our success; what about the other four scalar\nequations? They must be satisfied too.\nFirst note that again, all force vectors lie in the plane of the page. Not only\nthat, but their lines of action are all parallel, parallel to the vertical. Hence force\nequilibrium in all but the vertical direction is satisfied. That takes care of two of\nthe four.\nSecond, since the force vectors all lie in a single plane, they can only produce\na turning effect, a torque or a moment, about an axis perpendicular to that plane.\nThus moments about the axes lying in the plane, the x,y axes, will be identically\nzero. That takes care of the remaining two scalar equations not used.\nFrom all of these observations we can boldly state:\n- If the lines of action of all forces acting on a particle lie in a common\nplane, there are at most two independent, scalar, equilibrium equa\ntions available.\n- If the lines of action of all forces acting on an extended body are all\nparallel and lie in a common plane there are at most two independent,\nscalar, equilibrium equations available.\n- If the lines of action of all forces acting on an extended body all lie in a\ncommon plane there are at most three independent, scalar, equilib\nrium equations available.\nNote well, however, that these are statements about the maximum number of\nindependent equations available to us in particular contexts. They do not say that\nso many must derive from moment equilibrium and so many from force equilib\nrium. We have seen how, in the analysis of the lever used in lifting the end of Gali-\nleo's block up off the ground, we were able to apply moment equilibrium twice to\nobtain a different looking, but equivalent, system of two linearly independent\nequations - different from the two obtained applying moment equilibrium once\ntogether with force equilibrium in the vertical direction.\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nSimilarly for the block sliding, as a parti\ncle, down the plane we might have oriented\nour x,y axes along the horizontal and vertical\nin which case the two scalar equations of\nforce equilibrium would appear, for the hori\nφ\nφ\nW\nFf\nN\ny\nx\nzontal direction,\n-F f ⋅ cos φ + N ⋅ sin φ = 0\nand, for the vertical direction,\nN ⋅ cos φ + F f ⋅ sin φ - W = 0\nThese two are equivalent to the two force equilibrium equations we previously\nderived; they yield the same solution; they are synonymous; the two sets have\nidentical meaning.\nThe requirements of force and moment equilibrium have further implications\nfor particular systems of forces and moments. We use them to define two force\nmembers and three-force members.\nExercise 2.7\nWhat do you need to know in order to determine the reaction forces at\npoints A and B of the structure shown below?\nA\nB\nD\nθB\nθ A\nP\nIn that this problem, at least with regard to its geometry, looks like the block\nhanging from two cables of Exercise 2.2, we might begin by mimicking what we\ndiscovered we needed to know there:\n- You need to know the force applied P, just as we needed to know the\nweight of the block in Exercise 2.2.\n- You need to know the angles θA and θB\nThe other item needed-to-know doesn't apply since members AD and BD are\nnot cables. To go further we will now try to solve the problem. If we are able to\nsolve the problem we surely then should be able to say what we needed to know.\n\nChapter 2\nOn the other hand, it is entirely possible that a neophyte might be able to solve a\nproblem and yet not be able to articulate what they needed to know to get to that\npoint. This is called muddling through and ought not to be condoned as evidence\nof competence.\nI first isolate the system, cutting\nthe structure as a whole away from its\nmoorings at A and B.\nBy\nAx\nAy\nA\nθ\nθ B\nLAD\nLBD\nP\nLetting Ax, Ay, Bx and By be the\nhorizontal and vertical components of\nthe reaction forces at A and B, force\nBx\nequilibrium will be assured if\nA + B - P = 0\nx\nx\nand\nA + B\n= 0\ny\ny\nOur third equilibrium equation for this planar system of forces acting on an\nextended body may be obtained by taking moments about point A6.\nWe have\n(LAD ⋅ cos θA + LBD ⋅ cos θB ) ⋅ By - P LAD ⋅ sin θA = 0\n⋅\nIn this, I have taken clockwise as positive. Observe that the two lengths that\nappear in this equation are related by\n⋅ sin θA =\n⋅ sin θB\nLAD\nLBD\nAt first glance it would appear that I must know one of these lengths in order to\nsolve the problem. This is not the case since the two lengths are linearly related\nand, after eliminating one of them from moment equilibrium, the other will be a\nfactor common to all terms in this equation, hence, will not appear in the final\nsolution for the reaction force components at A and B.\nProceeding in this way I can solve the equation expressing moment equilibrium\nand obtain By in terms of the applied load P.\nBy = -P ⋅[sin θB ⋅ sin θB ] ⁄ [sin (θA + θB)]\nForce equilibrium in the y direction, the second equilibrium equation, then\ngives\nAy = -B = P ⋅[sin θB ⋅ sin θB ] ⁄ [sin (θA + θB )]\ny\nSo far so good.... but then again, that's as far as we can go; we are truly up a\ncreek. There is no way we can find unique expressions for Ax and Bx in terms of P,\nθA, and θB without further information to supplement the first equilibrium equa\ntion. But watch!\n6. This is a bit of common dialect, equivalent to stating that the sum of the moments of all forces with respect to\nA will be set to zero in what follows. Note too how, in choosing A as a reference point for moments, the com\nponents of the reaction force at A do not enter into the equation of moment equilibrium.\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nI isolate a subsystem, member AD. The circles at the ends of the member are\nto be read as frictionless pins. That means they can support no moment or torque\nlocally, at the end points.\nFD\nD\nFA\nA\nD\nA\nThese circles act like a ring of ball bearings, offering no resistance to rotation\nto the member about either end. This implies that only a force can act at the ends.\nThese might appear as at the right. Now we apply equilibrium to this isolated,\nextended body\nFA + FD = 0 .\nThis implies that the two internal forces must be equal and opposite. Our isola\ntion diagram might then appear as on the left, below\nA\nD\nFA\nA\nD\nFA\nFD = - FA\nFD = - FA\nForce equilibrium is now satisfied but surely moment equilibrium is not. The\ntwo forces as shown produce an unbalanced couple. For this to vanish we require\nthat the two lines of action of the two forces be coincident, co-linear and our iso\nlation diagram must appear as on the right.\nWe can go no further. Yet we have a very important statement to make:\n- For a two force member, an isolated body with but two forces acting\nupon it, the two forces must be equal, opposite, and colinear.\nFor the straight member AD, this means that the lines of action of the forces\nacting at the ends of the member lie along the member. We say that the two-force\n(straight) member is in tension or compression.\nKnowing that the force at A acting on\nthe member AD acts along the member, we\nnow know that the direction of the reaction\nforce at A because the reaction force at A is\nthe same force. This follows from isolating\nthe support at A .\nHere we show the reaction force at A\nwith its components Ax and Ay now drawn\nsuch that\nAy ⁄ A\n= tan θA\nAx\nA\nθ\nDirection\nof FA\nAy\nx\n\nChapter 2\nThis last equation, together with the first equilibrium equation and our previ\nously obtained expression for Ay, enables us to solve for both Ax and Bx. And that\ncompletes the exercise.\nAt this point, the reader may feel cheated. Why not go on and find the reaction\nforces at the points A and B? No. I have solved the need to know problem as it was\nposed. I have constructed a well posed problem; I can farm it out to some subordi\nnate to carry through the solution, confident that anyone with a basic knowledge\nof algebra can take it from here. The \"heavy lifting\" is over. So too, you must\nlearn to have confidence in your ability to set-up a well posed problem and to del\negate the responsibility for crank-turning to others, even to computational machin\nery. However, you, of course, remain responsible for evaluating the worth of what\ncomes back to you.\nIn conclusion, in addition to knowing the load P and the angles θA and θB. in\norder to solve the problem we need to know:\n- How to read a circle as a frictionless pin and what we mean by the phrase\ntwo-force member.\n- Also, again, how to experiment with isolations and equilibrium consider\nations of pieces of a system.\nSome final observations:\n- Say this structure was the work of some baroque architect or industrial\ndesigner who insisted that member BD have the form shown immediately\nbelow. While there may be legitimate reasons for installing a curved mem\nber connecting B to D, -- e.g., you need to provide adequate clearance for\nwhat is inside the structure, this creates no problem. The reactions at A and\nB (see below) will be the same as before (assuming frictionless pins).\nWhat will change is the mode in which the, baroque, now curved, member\nBD carries the load. It is no longer just in compression. It is subject to\nbending, a topic we consider in a section below7.\nP\nA\nB\nD\n- Returning to our original structure with straight members, t he same sort\nof analysis of an isolation of member BD alone would lead us to conclude\nthat the direction of the reaction at B must be up along the member BD. Is\n7. Independent of such motives, some will argue that \"form follows function\"; the baroque for baroque's sake\nis not only functionally frivolous but ugly.\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nthis the case? That is, do the values obtained for B and B obtained above\nx\nsatisfy the relationship tanθB = -By /Bx? Check it out!\ny\nExercise 2.8\nShow that the force F required to just start the lawn roller, of radius R and\nweight W, moving up over the ledge of height h is given by\n⁄\n⁄\nF W = tan φ\nwhere\ncos φ = 1 - (h R).\nWe, as always, start by isolating the system - the roller - showing all the forces\nR\nh\nφ\n-\nacting upon it. These include the weight acting downward through the center of\nthe roller; the horizontal force applied along the handle by the child laborer (note\nthe frictionless pin fastening the handle to the roller); and the components of the\nreaction force at the bump, shown as Nx and Ny.\nF\nNx\nNy\nW\nNote the implications of the phrase just start... This is to\nbe read as meaning there is no, or insignificant, contact\nwith the ground at any other point than at the bump.\nHence the reaction of the ground upon the roller acts at\nthe bump alone.8 Force equilibrium gives\nN - W = 0\nand\nN + F = 0\ny\nx\nMoment equilibrium will give us a third equation sufficient to determine the\nthree unknowns Nx, Ny and, the really important one, F. I take moments about the\ncenter of the roller and immediately observe that the resultant of Nx and Ny must\npass through the center of the roller since only it produces a moment about our\nchosen reference point. That is, the orientation of the reaction force shown below\non the left violates moment equilibrium. The reaction force must be directed as\nshown in the middle figure.\nφ\nW\nW\nW\nN\nF\nφ\nN\nF\nF\nN\n8. It is impossible give you a cookbook rule on how to read phrases like just start. Effective working knowl\nedge comes with the exercising of the language. Furthermore I can give you no assurance that an author of\nanother text, will use the exact same phrase to indicate this condition.\n\nChapter 2\nFurthermore, we require the three forces to sum to zero to satisfy force equi\nlibrium, so: F + W + N = 0.\nThis is shown graphically in the figure at the far right above. From this we\nobtain what we were asked to show. (A bit of analytical geometry leads to both\nrelationships). Now from this we can state another rule, namely\n- For an isolated system subject to but three forces, a three force system,\nthe three forces must be concurrent. That is their lines of action must\nall run together and intersect at a common point.\nNote the priority of the equilibrium requirements in fixing a solution. We\nmight have begun worrying about the frictional force, or something akin to a fric\ntional force, acting at the bump, resisting motion. But our analysis says there is no\nfrictional force! The reaction is perpendicular to the plane of contact; the latter is\ntangent to the surface at the bump and perpendicular to the radius. How can this\nbe? Nothing was said about \"assume friction can be neglected\" or \"this urchin is\npulling the roller up over a bump in the ice on the pond\" No, because nothing need\nbe said! Moment equilibrium insists that the reaction force be directed as shown.\nMoment equilibrium has top priority. The Platonists win again; it's mostly, if not\nall, in your mind.\nResultant Force and Moment\nFor static equilibrium of an isolated body,\nM x\nM\nM z .\nM\nz\nA'\nj\nk\nthe resultant force and the resultant moment\nacting on the body must vanish. These are vec-\ni\ntor sums.\nOften it is useful to speak of the resultant\nforce and moment of some subset of forces\n(and moments). For example, a moment vector\ny\ncan be spoken of as the resultant of its, at most,\nx\nthree scalar components. In the figure, the\nA\ny\nmoment or torque about the inclined axis AA' is the resultant or vector sum of the\nthree vectors Mx, My and Mz each of which can be written as the product of a sca\nlar magnitude and a unit vector directed along the appropriate coordinate axis.\nThat is, we can write.\nM = Mx + My + Mz = M ⋅ i + M ⋅ j + M ⋅ k\nx\ny\nz\nA moment in itself can be spoken of as the resultant of a force but, while this\nphrasing is formally correct, it is rarely used. Instead we speak of the moment at a\npoint due to a force or the moment about a point of the force.... as in \"the moment,\nabout the point O of the force FA is given by the product of (1) the perpendicular\ndistance from the point O to the line of action of the force and (2) the magnitude\nof the force. Its direction is given by the right-hand rule.\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nThe right-hand rule is one of those oddities in science and engineering. It is\noften stated as\n- the direction of the moment of a force about a point is the same as the\ndirection of advance of a right handed screw when the screw is ori\nented perpendicular to the plane defined by the line of action of the\nforce and the reference point for the moment.\nThis is a mouthful but it works. It meets the need to associate a direction with\nthe turning effect of a force.\nWe can seemingly avoid this kind of talk by defining the moment as the vector\ncross product of a position vector from the reference point to any point on the line\nof action of the force. But we are just passing the buck; we still must resort to this\nsame way of speaking in order to define the direction of the vector cross product.\nIt is worth going through the general\nφ\ndefinition of moment as a vector cross\nproduct9. Some useful techniques for cal\nculating moments that avoid the need to\nfind a perpendicular distance become evi\ndent\ne\nThe magnitude of the vector cross\nproduct, that is he magnitude of the\nmoment of the force about the point O\nabove is\nM0\nF A\nr\nd\nr\nFA\n×\n=\n= r\nFA\n⋅\n⋅ sin φ\nMO\n⋅\nor, striking the bold face to indicate scalar magnitude alone MO = r F A ⋅ sin φ\nThis is in essence the definition of the vector cross product. The direction of\nthe moment is indicated on the figure by the unit vector e. Note: e is commonly used to rep\nresent a unit vector. Its heritage is German; eine is one.\nNote that we recover the more specialized definition of the magnitude of the\nmoment, that which speaks of perpendicular distance from the reference point to\nthe line of action of the force, by writing\nd = r ⋅ sin φ\nso that\nMO = d F A\n⋅\nObserve that I could have interpreted the magnitude of the moment as the\nproduct of r and the component of the force perpendicular to the position vector,\nnamely Fsinφ.\n9. Vector and cross are redundant when used to describe \"product\". We ought to speak only of the vector prod\nuct or the cross product. Similarly, the dot product of two vectors can be called the scalar product. It would\nbe again redundant to speak of the scalar, dot product. We speak redundantly here in order to emphases that\nthe outcome of a cross product is a vector\n\nChapter 2\nIn evaluating the cross product, you must take care to define the angle φ as the\nincluded angle between the position vector and the force vector when the two are\nplaced \"tail-to-tail\". φ is the angle swept out when you swing the position vector\naround to align with the force vector, moving according to the right hand rule.\nThe payoff of using the cross product to evaluate the moment of a force with\nrespect to a point is that you can choose a position vector from the point to any\npoint on the line of action of the force. In particular, if you have available the sca\nlar components of some position vector and the scalar components of the force,\nthe calculation of both the magnitude and direction of the moment is a machine\nlike operation.\nExercise 2.9\nShow that the moment about point A due to the tension in the cable DB is\ngiven by\nM = (-0.456 ⋅i + 0.570 ⋅k) ⋅\n⋅\nL FD\nwhere i, j, k are, as usual, three unit vectors directed along the three axes x, y, z.\nB\nC\nD\nA\ny\nL\nW\n2/3L\nx\n2/3L\n5/6 L\nL\nE\nA\neBD\nFD\nk\ni\nj\nrD\nz\n5/6 L\n2/3L\n= L j\nB\nD\nBall and Socket joint\nThe approach is reductive and mechanical. I will use the vector machinery of\nthe cross product, first expressing a position vector and the force in terms of their\nx,y,z components using the scalar magnitude/unit vector mode of representation\nfor each. For the position vector I write, enjoying the freedom I have to select any\npoint on the line of action of the force as the head of the vector:\nrD = L ⋅j\nSimple enough! But now matters become more complex. I write the tension in\nthe cable as the product of its magnitude, FD and a unit vector directed along its\nline of action, along the line running from B to D. Constructing the unit vector\n\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nrequires the application of the pythagorean theorem and other bits of analytical\ngeometry. From the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of the cable BD is\n⁄\n1 2\n⁄\n⁄\nLBD = [(5 6)2 + ( ) + (2 3)2]\n1 2 ⋅L\nThe components of the unit vector, eBD, from B to D are then\n- (5/6)L/LBDalong x, -1L/LBD along y, and -(2/3)L/LBDalong z. So:\n⁄\n⁄\n⁄\n⁄\n⁄\neBD = -(5 6)(L LBD)i - 1(L LBD) ⋅j - (2 3)(L LBD) ⋅k\nor, with LBD defined above and calculating to three significant figures10,\neBD = -0.570 ⋅i - 0.684 ⋅j - 0.456 ⋅k\nThe moment of the tension in the cable BD about A is then obtained from the\ncross product:\n=\n×\nM\nr\nFD = L ⋅j × ( 0.570\n-\n⋅i 0.648\n-\n⋅j 0.456\n-\n⋅k) ⋅FD\nOur cross product is now a collection of three cross products. The machinery\nfor doing these includes\n×\n×\n×\ni\nj = k\nj\nk\n\n= i\nk\ni = j\nand recognition that the cross product is sensi\ntive to the order of the two vectors, for example\nL FD\nj×i = -k, and that the vector product of a unit M = (-0.456 ⋅i + 0.570 ⋅k) ⋅\n⋅\n\nvector with itself is zero. Cranking through, we\nobtain\n- Observe that the moment has a component along the x axis (negatively\ndirected), another along the z axis but not along the y axis; the force pro\nduces no turning effect about the vertical axis. Indeed, the force intersects\nthe y axis.\n10. Three significant figures are generally sufficient for most engineering work. You are responsible for round\ning off the 8, 16 or 20 numbers contemporary spread sheets and other calculating machinery generates. You\nmust learn how to bite off what you can't possible chew.\n\nChapter 2\n- Observe that you can deduce from this\nA\nBD\nFD\nk\ni\nrD\n5/6 L\n2/3L\n= L j\nD\n.730 L\ne\nresult the perpendicular distance from A\nB j\nto the line of action of the force by\nrecasting the vector term as a unit vec\ntor. The factor introduced to accomplish\nthis when associated with the length L\nthen defines the perpendicular distance.\nThat is, we write, noting that [.4562 +\n.5702]1/2 = .730\nM = (- 0.627 ⋅i + 0.781 ⋅k)(0.730 ⋅L) ⋅FD\nand so the perpendicular distance from A to the line of action must be\n0.730L.\n- Finally, observe that I could have constructed a position vector from A to\nD, namely\n⁄\nL\n⁄\nL\nr = -(5 6) ⋅\n⋅i-(2 3) ⋅\n⋅k\nand used this to compute the moment. (See problem 2.8)\nCouple\nThere exists one particularly important resultant moment, that due to two equal\nand opposite forces - so particular and important that we give it its own name -\ncouple. To see why this moment merits singling out, consider the resultant\nmoment about the point O of the two equal and opposite forces F and F .\nA\nB\n=\nFB\na\nb\ndAB\nO\n- O'\nFA\nO\nM0\n- O'\nWe can write the scalar magnitude of the moment, taking counter clockwise as\n⋅\n-\npositive,\nMO = -a ⋅F A + b FB = (b\na) ⋅F A\nwhere we have explicitly made use of the fact that the forces are equal and opposite by\ntaking F = - FA. Note that this equation is written only in terms of the scalar magnitudes\nB\nof the forces and the moment. The figures on the left and right show two equivalent sys\ntems of forces.\n\n⋅\n⋅\nStatic Equilibrium Force and Moment\nNote that (b-a) is just the (perpendicular) distance, dAB between the two paral\nlel lines of action of the two forces, so if I were to ask \"what is the moment of the\ntwo forces about some other point?\" say O', my response would be the same. In\nfact\n- the moment due to two equal and opposite forces, a couple is invariant\nwith respect to choice of reference point; its value is given by the prod\nuct of the perpendicular distance between the two lines of action of the\ntwo forces and the value of the force. The resultant force due to the two\nequal and opposite forces is zero.\nExercise 2.10\nShow that, for equilibrium of the cantilever beam loaded with two equal\nand oppositely directed forces as shown, the reaction at the wall is a couple\nof magnitude Fd and having a direction \"out of the paper\" or counter\nclockwise.\n-F\nF\nd\nd\na\n-F\nF\nRx\nRy\nM\nA\na\nWe isolate the cantilever beam, showing all the applied and reaction forces\n(and couples) acting. This is shown at the right. Note the symbol, the circular\narrow. It represents the unknown couple or moment acting at the point A, assumed\nhere to be acting counterclockwise. Force equilibrium requires\n-\nRx = 0;\nRy + F\nF = 0\nThese immediately lead to the conclusion that the reaction force at A is zero.\nR as well as Rx are zero.\nMoment equilibrium about the point A11 requires\ny\nM A - F d = 0\nso\nMA = F d\nWe say The reaction at A is the couple Fd.\n11. Note the difference between the two phrases moment acting at the point or about the point and moment equi\nlibrium about the point. We say there is a moment (couple) acting at the point and then, in the next breath,\nsay that the resultant moment about the point must vanish for equilibrium to be satisfied. There is nothing\ninconsistent here. It is essential that you understand the difference in these two expressions.\n\nChapter 2\nThe exercise above might strike you as overly abstract and useless, almost a\ntautology, as if we proved nothing of worth. Don't be fooled. The purpose of the\nexercise is not algebraic analysis but rather to move you to accept the existence of\ncouple as an entity in itself, a thing that is as real as force. You may not sense a\ncouple the way you feel a force but in Engineering Mechanics the former is just as\nlively and substantial a concept as the latter.\nNote too how if the beam had been clamped to a wall at its other end, at the\nright rather than at the left, the reaction at the wall would still be a couple of mag\nnitude Fd directed counterclockwise.\nExercise 2.11\nWhat if the beam of the last exercise is supported at the wall by two fric\ntionless pins A,B? What can you say about the reaction forces at the pins?\nd\na\nh\nF\nFA\n-F\n- FA\n-F\nF\nd\na\nB\nA\nFB =\nWe can say that the two forces acting on the pins, say F , FB, are equal and\nA\nopposite. We can say that they are equivalent to a couple of magnitude Fd and of\ndirection counter clockwise. All of this follows from both force and moment equi\nlibrium requirements applied to the beam when isolated from the wall to which it\nis pinned. We can say nothing more.\nWell, that's not quite the case: While we cannot say what their magnitude is,\nwe can say that they are at least as big as the product F(d/h). That is\nF A = FB ≥F\nd\nh\n\n) because h is the maximum possible perpendicular distance\n⋅(\n⁄\nthat can be drawn between any two parallel lines of action drawn through A and B.\nThe couple Fd in these few exercises is an equivalent system - equivalent to\nthat of two equal and opposite forces separated a distance d. In fact, the notion of\nequivalent force system is closely wrapped up with the requirements of force and\nof moment equilibrium. We can replace one equivalent force system by another in\nour equilibrium deliberations and the results of our analysis will be the same\nbecause\n- equivalent systems have the same resultant force and the same result\nant moment about any, arbitrarily chosen point.\nFurthermore, now that we allow a couple vector to be a thing in itself:\n\nChapter 2\n- every system of any number of force vectors and couple vectors can\nbe represented by an equivalent system consisting of a single force\nvector together with a single couple vector.\nFor example, the three systems shown below are all equivalent\nF\nF\nF\nF\na\na\n=\n=\naF\n- F\nExercise 2.12\nShow that for the load W, uniformly distributed over the span L, (a) an\nequivalent system is a force vector of magnitude W directed downward act\ning at the center of the span and no couple; (b) another is a force vector of\nmagnitude W directed downward acting at the left end of the span and a\ncouple of magnitude W(L/2) directed clockwise; another is.....\nW\nW\nW/L\n=\n=\nW L/2\nL\nL/2\nFor parts (a) and (b) the resultant force is clearly the total load W. In fact,\nregardless of how the load is distributed over the span, the resultant, equivalent\nforce, will have magnitude W and be directed vertically downward. The location\nof its line of action is a matter of choice. Different choices, however imply differ\nent moments or couples -- the other ingredient of our equivalent system.\nTaking midspan as our reference point, (a), we see that the load, if uniformly\ndistributed, on the right will produce a moment clockwise about center span, that\non the left will produce a moment counter clockwise about center span. The mag\nnitudes of the two moments will be equal, hence the resultant moment of the uni\nformly distributed load with reference to center span is zero.\nTaking the left end of the span as our reference point, (b), we can make use of\nthe equivalence displayed in the preceding figure on the preceding page where\nnow a is read as the distance L/2 between the vertical load W acting downward at\ncenter span and the left end of the span.\n\nChapter 2\nExercise 2.13\nShow that a radially directed force per unit length, α, with units newtons/\nmeter, uniformly distributed around the circumference of the half circle is\nequivalent to a single force vector of magnitude 2α R, where R is the radius\nof the half circle, and no couple.\nR\n∆F = (α-∆s)er\nα\n∆s\nR\nφ\nθ\n: force/length\nWe integrate. We sum up vertical components of differential elements of the\ndistributed force around the circumference.\nA differential element of force, ∆ F, acting on the\ndifferential length of circumference ∆ s is where the\n∆F = (α ∆\n⋅\ns) ⋅ er\nunit vector e is taken positive inward. The vertical\nr\ncomponent of this is given by α ∆ scosθ which, noting that θ = (π/2) - φ, can be\nwritten αsinφ∆ s . Now ∆ s is just R∆φ so we can write\nπ\nFdown = ∫αsin φ(Rdφ) = 2αR\nwhere the α and R are constants.\n\nChapter 2\nDesign Exercise 2.1\nThe exercise set out below and the others like it to follow are not complete. It\nis a design exercise and, as such, differs from the problems you have been\nassigned up to now. It, and the other design exercises to follow, is different in that\nthere is no single right answer. Although these exercises are keyed to specific sin-\ngle-answer problems in the text and are made to emphasize the fundamental con\ncepts and principles of the subject, they are open-ended. The responses you\nconstruct will depend upon how you, your classmates, and your recitation instruc\ntor flesh out the task.\nIn effect, we want you to take responsibility in part for defining the problem,\nfor deciding which constraints and specifications are critical, and setting the con\ntext for evaluating possible \"solutions\". Design is the essence of engineering and\nthe act of design includes formulating problems as much as solving them, negoti\nating constraints as well as making sure your solutions respect them, and team\nwork as well as individual competence.\nHospital-bed Wheel Size\n?\n?\nYour task is to do a first-cut analysis in support of the design of a new, light\nweight, mobile hospital bed. You know that the bed will be used to transport\npatients indoors on caster type wheels over relatively smooth terrain but there will\nbe some small obstacles and bumps it must traverse without discomfort to the\npatient. A single attendant should be able to push the bed to its destination.\nDevelop a rationale for fixing the size of the wheels and use it to determine a\nrange of possible diameters.\n\nChapter 2\nDesign Exercise 2.2\nYour boss wants to diversify.

      "content": "Internal Forces and Moments\n3.1\nInternal Forces in Members of a Truss\nStructure\nWe are ready to start talking business, to buy a loaf of bread. Up until now we\nhave focused on the rudimentary basics of the language; the vocabulary of force,\nmoment, couple and the syntax of static equilibrium of an isolated particle or\nextended body. This has been an abstract discourse for the most part. We want\nnow to start speaking about \"extended bodies\" as structural members, as the\nbuilding blocks of truss structures, frame structures, shafts and columns and the\nlike. We want to be go beyond questions about forces and moments required to\nsatisfy equilibrium and ask \"...When will this structure break? Will it carry the\nprescribed loading?\"\nWe will discover that, with our current language skills, we can only answer\nquestions of this sort for one type of structure, the truss structure, and then only\nfor a subset of all possible truss structures. To go further we will need to broaden\nour scope, beyond the requirements of force and moment equilibrium, and analyze\nthe deformations and displacements of extended bodies in order to respond to\nquestions about load carrying ability regardless of the type and complexity of the\nstructure at hand - the subject of a subsequent chapter. Here we will go as far as\nwe can go with the vocabulary and rules of syntax at our disposal. After all, the\nrequirements of force and moment equilibrium still must be satisfied whatever\nstructure we confront.\nA truss structure is designed, fabricated, and assembled such that its members\ncarry the loads in tension or compression. More abstractly, a truss structure is\nmade up of straight, two-force members, fastened together by frictionless\npins; all loads are applied at the joints.\nNow, we all know that there is no such thing as a truly frictionless pin; you\nwill not find them in a suppliers catalogue. And to require that the loads be\napplied at the joints alone seems a severe restriction. How can we ensure that this\nconstraint is abided by in use?\nWe can't and, indeed, frictionless pins do not exist. This is not to say that there\nare not some ways of fastening members together that act more like frictionless pins than\nother ways.\nWhat does exist inside a truss structure are forces and moments of a quite gen\neral nature but the forces of tension and compression within the straight members\nare the most important of all if the structure is designed, fabricated, and assem\nbled according to accepted practice. That is, the loads within the members of a\n\n54 Chapter 3\ntruss structure may be approximated by those obtained from an analysis of an\nabstract representation (as straight, frictionless pinned members, loaded at the\njoints alone) of the structure. Indeed, this abstract representation is what serves as\nthe basis for the design of the truss structure in the first place.\nAny member of the structure shown above will, in our abstract mode of imag-\nining, be in either tension or compression - a state of uniaxial loading. Think of\nhaving a pair of special eyeglasses - truss seeing glasses - that, when worn,\nenable you to see all members as straight lines joined by frictionless pins and\nexternal forces applied at the joints as vectors. This is how we will usually sketch\nthe truss structure, as you would see it through such magical glasses.\nNow if you look closer and imagine cutting away\none of the members, say with circular cross-section,\nyou would see something like what's shown: This\nparticular member carries its load, F, in tension; The\nmember is being stretched.\nIf we continue our imagining, increasing the applied, external loads slowly,\nthe tension in this member will increase proportionally. Eventually, the member\nwill fail. Often a structure fails at its joints. We rule out this possibility here, assuming that our joints have\nbeen over-designed. The way in which the member fails, as well as the tensile force at\nwhich it fails, depends upon two things: The cross-sectional area of the member\nand the material out of which it is made.\nIf it is grey cast iron with a cross sectional area of 1.0 in2, the member will\nfracture, break in two, when the tensile force approaches 25,000 lb. If it is made\nof aluminum alloy 2024-T4 and its area is 600mm2 it will yield, begin to deform\nplastically, when the tensile forces approaches 195,000 Newtons. In either case\nthere is some magnitude of the tensile force we do not want to exceed if we wish\nto avoid failure.\nContinue on with the thought experiment: Imagine that we replaced this mem-\nber in our truss structure with another of the same length but twice the cross-sec-\ntional area. What tensile load can the member now carry before failure?\nIn this imaginary world, the tensile force required for failure will be twice\nwhat it was before. In other words, we take the measure of failure for a truss mem-\nber in tension to be the tensile (or compressive) stress in the member where the\nstress is defined as the magnitude of the force divided by the cross-sectional area\nF\nF\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nof the member. In this we assume that the force is uniformly distributed over the\ncross-sectional area as shown below.\n= F/A\nF\nσ\nA\nFurther on we will take a closer look at how materials fail due to internal\nforces, not just tensile and compressive. For now we take it as an empirical obser\nvation and operational heuristic that to avoid fracture or yielding of a truss mem\nber we want to keep the tensile or compressive stress in the member below a\ncertain value, a value which depends primarily upon the material out of which the\nmember is made. (We will explore later on when we are justified taking a failure\nstress in uniaxial compression equal to the failure stress in uniaxial tension.) It\nwill also depend upon what conventional practice has fixed for a factor of safety.\nSymbolically, we want\nF A < (F A) failure\nor\nσ\nσ\n⁄\n⁄\n<\nfailure\nwhere I have introduced the symbol σ to designate the uniformly distributed stress.\nExercise 3.1\nIf the members of the truss structure of Exercise 2.7 are made of 2024-T4\nAluminum, hollow tubes of diameter 20.0 mm and wall thickness 2.0 mm,\nestimate the maximum load P you can apply before the structure yields.1 In\nthis take θA, θ\nto be 30o, 60o respectively\nB\nD\nD\nP\nFB\nFB\nFA\nA\nB\n30o\n30.0°\n60.0°\nFA\n60o\nP\nRather than picking up where we left off in our analysis of Exercise 2.7., we\nmake an alternate isolation, this time of joint, or node D showing the unknown\nmember forces directed along the member. By convention, we assume that both\nmembers are in tension. If the value for a member force comes out to be negative,\n1. Another failure mode, other than yielding, is possible: Member AD might buckle. We will attend to this pos\nsibility in the last chapter.\n\nChapter 3\nwe conclude that the member is in compression rather than tension. This is an example\nof a convention often, but not always, adopted in the analysis and design of truss structures. You are free to vio\nlate this norm or set up your own but, beware: It is your responsibility to note the difference between your\nmethod and what we will take as conventional and understood without specification.\nForce equilibrium of this node as particle then provides two scalar equations\nfor the two scalar unknown member forces. We have\n-F A ⋅ cos 30o + FB ⋅ cos 60o - P = 0\n-F A ⋅ sin 30o -FB ⋅ sin 60o\n=\nFrom these, we find that member AD is in compression, carrying a load of (√3/\n2)P and member BD is in tension, carrying a load P/2. The stress in each member\nis the force divided by the cross-sectional area where I have approximated the area\n×\n40π 10 6\n-\nA = π ⋅(20 × 10 3\n- ) ⋅(2\n\n- )m =\n×\nm 2\nof the cross-section of the thin-walled tube as a rectangle whose length is equal to\nthe circumference of the tube and width equal to the wall thickness.\nNow the compressive stress in member AD is greater in magnitude than the\ntensile stress in member BD - about 1.7 times greater - thus member AD will\nyield first. This defines the mode of failure. The compressive stress in AD is\nσ = ( 3 2\n⁄\n) ⋅ P A\n⁄\nwhich we will say becomes excessive if it approaches 80% of the value of the stress at\nwhich 2024-T4 Aluminum begins to yield in uniaxial tension. The latter is listed as 325\nMegaPascals in the handbooks2.\nWe estimate then, that the structure will fail, due to yielding of member AD,\nwhen\nP = (2 ⁄ 3) ⋅(0.80) ⋅(\n×\nm ) ⋅(325 × 106 N m2 ) = 37 700N\n40π 10 6\n-\n⁄\n,\n***\nI am going to now alter this structure by adding a third member CD. We might\nexpect that this would pick up some of the load, enabling the application of a load\nP greater than that found above before the onset of yielding. We will discover that\nwe cannot make this argument using our current language skills. We will find that\nwe need new vocabulary and rules of syntax in order to do so. Let us see why.\n2. A Pascal is one Newton per Square meter. Mega is10 6. Note well how the dimensions of stress are the same\nas those of pressure, namely, force per unit area. See Chapter 7 for a crude table of failure stress values.\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nExercise 3.2\nShow that if I add a third member to the structure of Exercise 3.1 connect\ning node D to ground at C, the equations of static equilibrium do not suffice\nto define the tensile or compressive forces in the three members.\nA\nh\nLAD\nLBD\nP\nxB\nxC\nC\nB\nθA\nθC\nθB\nD\nI isolate the system, starting as I did when I first encountered this structure,\ncutting out the whole structure from its supporting pins at A, B and C.\nThe free\nD\nFA\nFC C\nB\nFB\nθA\nθB\nθC\nxc\nh\nP\nA\nx\nB\nbody diagram above shows the direction of the unknown member forces as along\nthe members, a characteristic of this and every truss structure. Force equilibrium\nin the horizontal direction and vertical direction produces two scalar equations:\n-F A ⋅\nθA\ncos\nFC\n-\n⋅\nθC\ncos\n+ FB ⋅\nθB\ncos\n- P = 0\nand\nF A ⋅\nθA\nsin\nFB\n+\n⋅\nθB\nsin\n+ FC ⋅\nθC\nsin\n= 0\nAt this point I note that the above can be read as two equations in three\nunknowns -- the three forces in the members -- presuming we are given the\nangles θA, θB, and θC, together with the applied load P. We clearly need another\nequation.\n\nChapter 3\nSumming moments about A I can write\nxB ⋅ FB ⋅ sin θB + xC ⋅ FC ⋅ sin θC - h P = 0\n⋅\nxC =\n⋅ cos θA -\n⋅ cos θC\nLAD\nLCD\nwhere\nand\nxB = LAD ⋅ cos θA + LBD ⋅ cos θB\nand\nh = LAD ⋅ sin θA = LCD ⋅ sin θC = LBD ⋅ sin θB\nI now proceed to try to solve for the unknown member forces in terms of some\nor all of these presumed given geometrical parameters. First I write the distances\nxC = h ⋅[(cos θA ⁄ sin θA) - (cos θC ⁄ sin θC )]\nx and x as\nand\nC\nB\nxB = h ⋅[(cos θA ⁄ sin θA ) + (cos θB ⁄ sin θB )]\nor\nsin (θC - θA)\nsin (θA + θB )\nxC = h ⋅ --------------------------------\nand\nxB = h ⋅ -------------------------------\nsin θA ⋅ sin θC\nsin θA ⋅ sin θB\nWith these, the equation for moment equilibrium about A becomes after substi\ntuting for the x's and canceling out the common factor h,\nFB ⋅ sin (θA + θB ) + FC ⋅ sin (θC - θA) - P ⋅ sin θA = 0\nIt appears, at first glance that we are in good shape, that we have three scalar\nequations - two from force equilibrium, this last from moment equilibrium -\navailable to determine the three member forces, FA, F\nand FC. We proceed by\nB\neliminating FA, one of our unknowns from the equations of force equilibrium. We\nwill then be left with two equations - those we derive from force and moment\nequilibrium - for determining F and F .\nB\nC\nWe multiply the equation expressing force equilibrium in the horizontal direc\ntion by the factor sinθA, that expressing force equilibrium in the vertical direction\nby the factor cosθA then add the two equations and obtain\nB ⋅(sin θA ⋅ cos θB + cos θA ⋅ sin θB) + F ⋅(sin θC ⋅ cos θA - sin θA ⋅ cos θC ) - P ⋅ sin θA = 0\nC\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nThis can be written, using the appropriate trig identities,\nFB ⋅ sin (θA + θB ) + FC ⋅ sin (θC - θA) - P ⋅ sin θA = 0\nwhich is identical to the equation we obtained from operations on the equation of moment\nequilibrium about A above. This means we are up a creek. The equation of moment equi\nlibrium gives us no new information we did not already have from the equations of force\nequilibrium. We say that the equation of moment equilibrium is linearly dependent upon\nthe latter two equations. We cannot find a unique solution for the member forces. We say\nthat this system of equations is linearly dependent. We say that the problem is stati\ncally, or equilibrium, indeterminate. The equations of equilibrium do not suffice to\nenable us to find a unique solution for the unknowns. Once again, the meaning of the word indeter\nminate is best illustrated by the fact that we can find many, many solutions for the member forces that satisfy\nequilibrium.\nThis time there are no special tricks, no special effects hidden in subsystems,\nthat would enable us to go further. That's it. We can not solve the problem. Rather,\nwe have solved the problem in that we have shown that the equations of equilib\nrium are insufficient to the task.\nObserve\n- That the forces in the members might depend upon how well a machinist\nhas fabricated the additional member CD. Say he or she made it too short.\nThen, in order to assemble the structure, you are going to have to pull the\nnode D down toward point C in order to fasten the new member to the oth\ners at D and to the ground at C. This will mean that the members will\nexperience some tension or compression even when the applied load is\nzero3! We say the structure is preloaded. The magnitudes of the preloads\nwill depend upon the extent of the incompatibility of the length of the\nadditional member with the distance between point C and D\n- We don't need the third member if the load P never comes close to the fail\nure load determined in the previous exercise. The third member is redun\ndant. In fact, we could remove any one of the other two members and the\nremaining two would be able to support a load P of some significant mag\nnitude. With three members we have a redundant structure. A redundant\nstructure is most often synonymous with a statically indeterminate\nsystem of equations.\n- I could have isolated joint D at the outset and immediately have recog\nnized that only two linearly independent equations of equilibrium are\navailable. Moment equilibrium would be identically satisfied since all\nforce vectors intersect at a common point, at the node D.\n3. This is one reason why no engineering drawing of structural members is complete without the specification\nof tolerances.\n\nChapter 3\nIn the so-called \"real world\", some truss structures are designed as redundant\nstructures, some not Why you might want one or the other is an interesting ques\ntion. More about this later.\nStatically determinate trusses can be quite complex, fully three-dimensional\nstructures. They are important in their own right and we have all that we need to\ndetermine their member forces-- namely, the requirements of static equilibrium.\nExercise 3.3\nConstruct a procedure for calculating the forces in all the members of the\nstatically determinate truss shown below. In this take α = √3\nL\nW\nL\nW\nL\nW\nL\nW\nL\nW\nL\nαL\n1. We begin with an isolation of the entire structure:\nL\nW\nL\nW\nL\nW\nL\nW\nL\nW\nL\nRx\nRx\nαL\n\nRy\nRy\n2. Then we determine the reactions at the supports.\nThis is not always a necessity, as it is here, but generally it is good practice.\nNote all of the strange little circles and shadings at the support points at the left\nand right ends of the structure. The icon at the left end of the truss is to be read as\nmeaning that:\n- the joint is frictionless and\n- the joint is restrained in both the horizontal and vertical direction, in fact,\nthe joint can't move in any direction.\nThe icon at the right shows a frictionless pin at the joint but it itself is sitting\non more frictionless pins. The latter indicate that the joint is free to move in the\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nhorizontal direction. This, in turn, means that the horizontal component of the\nreaction force at this joint, Rx\nis zero, a fact crucial to the determinancy of the\nproblem. The shading below the row of circles indicates that the joint is not free to\nmove in the vertical direction.\nFrom the symmetry of the applied loads, the total load of 5W is shared equally\nat the supports. Hence, the vertical components of the two reaction forces are\nRy1 = Ry12 = 5 W/2.\nBoth of the horizontal components of the reaction forces at the two supports\nmust be zero if one of them is zero. This follows from the requirement of force\nequilibrium applied to our isolation.\nRx = Rx\n= 0.\n3. Isolate a joint at which but two member forces have yet to be determined and apply the\nequilibrium requirements to determine their values.\nThere are but two joints, the two support joints that\nF1,2\nqualify for consideration this first pass through the pro\ncedure. I choose to isolate the joint at the left support.\nθ\nF1,3\nEquilibrium of force of node # 1 in the horizontal and\nvertical direction yields the two scalar equations for the\ntwo unknown forces in members 1-2 and 1-3. In this we\n(5/2)W\nagain assume the members are in tension. A negative\nresult will then indicate the member is in compression.\nThe proper way to speak of this feature of our isolation is\nto note how \"the members in tension pull on the joint\".\nEquilibrium in the x direction and in the y direction then requires:\nF1 2 ⋅ cos θ + F1 3 = 0\n,\n⁄\nF1 2 ⋅ sin θ + (5 2) ⋅ W = 0\n,\n,\nwhere the tanθ = α and given α = √3 so sinθ = √3 /2 and cosθ = 1/2. These yield\nF1 2\n,\n⁄\n(\n) W\nF1 3\n,\n⁄\n(\n) W\n⋅\n=\n⋅\n5 2 3\n-\n=\nThe negative sign indicates that member 1-2 is in compression.\n4. Repeat the previous step in the procedure.\nF2,3\nHaving found the forces in members 1,2 and 1,3,\nnode, or joint, # 3 becomes a candidate for isolation.\nIt shows but two unknown member forces intersecting at\nF1.3\nthe node. Node #12 remains a possibility as well. I\nF3,5\nchoose node #3. Force equilibrium yields\n+ F3 5 = 0\nand\n+ F2 3 - W = 0\nW\n- F1.3\n,\n,\n\nChapter 3\nNote how on the isolation I have, according to convention, assumed all mem\nber forces positive in tension. F1,3 acts to the left, pulling on pin # 3. This force\nvector is the equal and opposite, internal reaction to the F1,3 shown in the isola\ntion of node # 1. With F1,3 = (5/2√3)W we have\nF3 5 = (5 2 3\n⁄\n) ⋅ W\nand\n+ F2 3 = W\n,\n,\nThese equations are thus, easily solved, and we go again, choosing either node\n# 2 or # 12 to isolate in the next step.\n5. Stopping rule: Stop when all member forces have been determined.\nThis piece of machinery is called the method of joints. Statically determinate\ntruss member forces can be produced using other, just as sure-fire, proce-\ndures.(See problem 3.15) The main point to note is that all the member forces in a\ntruss can be determined from equilibrium conditions alone using a judiciously\nchosen sequence of isolations of the nodes if and only if the truss is statically\ndeterminate. That's a circular statement if there ever was one but you get the\npoint4.\n3.2\nInternal Forces and Moments in Beams\nA beam is a structural element like the truss member but, unlike the latter, it is\ndesigned, fabricated, and assembled to carry a load in bending 5. In this section\nwe will go as far as we can go with our current vocabulary of force, couple, and\nmoment and with our requirements of static equilibrium, attempting to explain\nwhat bending is, how a beam works, and even when it might fail.\nThe Cantilever according to Galileo\nYou, no doubt, know what a beam is in some sense, at least in some ordinary,\neveryday sense. Beams have been in use for a long time; indeed, there were beams\nbefore there were two-force members. The figure below shows a seventeenth cen\ntury cantilever beam. It appears in a book written by Galileo, his Dialogue Con\ncerning Two New Sciences.\n4. Note how, if I were to add a redundant member connecting node #3 to node #4, I could no longer find the\nforces in the members joined at node #3 (nor those in the members joined at nodes #2 and #5). The problem\nwould become equilibrium indeterminate\n5. Here is another circular statement illustrating the difficulty encountered in writing a dictionary which must\nnecessarily turn in on itself.\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nGalileo wanted to know when\nthe\ncantilever\nbeam\nwould\nbreak. He asked: What weight,\nhung from the end of the beam\nat C, would cause failure?\nYou might wonder about Gali-\nleo's state of mind when he\nposed the question. From the\nlooks of the wall it is the latter\nwhose failure he should be con\ncerned with, not the beam. No.\nYou are reading the figure\nincorrectly; you need to put on\nanother special pair of eye\nglasses that filter out the shrub\nbery and the decaying wall and\nallow you to see only a cantile\nver beam, rigidly attached to a\nrigid support at the end AB. These glasses will also be necessary in what follows,\nso keep them on.\nGalileo had, earlier in his book, dis\ncussed the failure of what we would call a\nbar in uniaxial tension. In particular, he\nclaimed and argued that the tensile force\nF\nσ = F/A\nrequired for failure is proportional to the\ncross sectional area of the bar, just as we\nhave done. We called the ratio of force to\narea a \"stress\". Galileo did not use our language but he grasped, indeed, might be\nsaid to have invented the concept, at least with respect to this one very important\ntrait - stress as a criterion for failure of a bar in tension. Galileo's achievement in\nanalyzing the cantilever beam under an end load lay in relating the end load at\nfailure to the failure load of a bar in uniaxial tension. Of course the bar had to be\nmade of the same material. His analysis went as follows:\nHe imagined the beam to be an angular lever pivoted at B. The weight, W, was\nsuspended at one end of the lever, at the end of the long arm BC. A horizontally\ndirected, internal, tensile force - let us call it F\n- acted along the other shorter,\nAB\nvertical arm of the lever AB. Galileo claimed this force acted at a point half way\nup the lever arm and provided the internal resistance to fracture.\nLook back at Galileo's figure with your special glasses on. Focus on the beam.\nSee now the internal resistance acting along a plane cut through the beam at AB.\nForget the possibility of the wall loosening up at the root of the cantilever. Take a\npeek ahead at the next more modern figure if you are having trouble seeing the\ninternal force resultant acting on the section AB.\n\nChapter 3\nFor moment equilibrium about the point B one must have\n(h ⁄ 2)F AB = W\nL\n⋅\nwhere I have set h equal to the height of the beam, AB, and L equal to the length of the\nbeam, BC.\nAccording to Galileo, the beam will fail when the ratio of FAB to the cross sec\ntional area reaches a particular, material specific value6. This ratio is what we\nhave called the failure stress in tension. From the above equation we see that, for\nmembers with the same cross section area, the end load, W, to cause failure of the\nmember acting as a cantilever is much less than the load, FAB,which causes failure\nof the member when loaded axially, as a truss member (by the factor of (1/2)h/L).\nA more general result, for beams of rectangular cross section but different\ndimensions, is obtained if we express the end load at failure in terms of the fail\nure stress in tension, i.e., σfailure :\n⁄\nW failure = --2(h L) ⋅ bh ⋅σ failure\nwhere\nσ failure = F AB\n⁄ (bh)\nfailure\nand where I have introduced b for the breadth of the beam. Observe:\nσ\n- This is a quite general result. If one has determined the value of the ratio\nfailure for a specimen in tension, what we would call the failure stress in a\ntension test, then this one number provides, inserting it into the equation\nabove, a way to compute the end load a cantilever beam, of arbitrary\ndimensions h, b and L, will support before failure.\n- Galileo has done all of this without drawing an isolation, or free-body\ndiagram!\n- He is wrong, precisely because he did not draw an isolation7 .\nTo state he was wrong is a bit too strong. As we shall see, his achievement is\nreal; he identified the underlying form of beam bending and its resistance to frac\nture. Let us see how far we can proceed by drawing an isolation and attempting to\naccommodate Galileo's story.\nA\nB\nL\nh\nD\nFAB\nW\nC\nb\n6. Galileo mentions wood, glass, and other materials as possibilities.\n7. This claim is a bit unfair and philosophically suspect: The language of mechanics was little developed at the\ndawn of the 17th century. \"Free body diagram\" was not in the vocabulary.\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nI have isolated the cantilever, cutting it at AB away from the rest of the beam\nnested in the wall. Here is where Galileo claims fracture will occur. I have shown\nthe weight W at the end of the beam, acting downward. I have neglected the\nweight of the material out of which the beam itself is fabricated. Galileo did the\nsame and even described how you could take the weight into account if desired. I\nhave shown a force FAB, the internal resistance, acting halfway up the distance AB.\nIs this system in equilibrium? No. Force equilibrium is not satisfied and\nmoment equilibrium about any other point but B is not satisfied This is a consequence of\nthe failure to satisfy force equilibrium. That is why he is wrong.\nOn the other hand, we honor his achievement. To see why, let us do our own\nisolation, and see how far we can go using the static equilibrium language skills\nwe have learned to date.\nWe allow that there may exist at the root of the cantilever, at our cut AB, a\nforce, FV and a couple M . We show only a vertical component of the internal\nL\nFV\nM0\nW\nreaction force since if there were any horizontal component, force equilibrium in\nthe horizontal direction would not be satisfied. I show the couple acting positive\ncounter clockwise, i.e., directed out of the plane of the paper.\nForce equilibrium then yields\nFV - W = 0\n\nor\n\nFV = W\nand moment equilibrium\n⋅\nM0 - W\nL = 0\nor\n\nM0 = WL\nAnd this is as far as we can go; we can solve for the vertical component of the\nreaction force at the root, FV, and for the couple (as we did in a prior exercise),\nM0, and that's it. But notice what has happened: There is no longer any horizontal\nforce FAB to compare to the value obtained in a tension test!\nIt appears we (and Galileo) are in serious trouble if our intent is to estimate\nwhen the beam will fail. Indeed, we can go no further.8 This is as far as we can go\nwith the requirements of static equilibrium.\n8. That is, if our criterion for failure is stated in terms of a maximum tensile (or compressive) stress, we can not\nsay when the beam would fail. If our failure criterion was stated in terms of maximum bending moment, we\ncould say when the beam would fail. But this would be a very special rule, applicable only for beams with\nidentical cross sections and of the same material.\n\nChapter 3\nBefore pressing further with the beam, we consider another problem, -- a truss\nstructure much like those cantilevered crane arms you see operating in cities, rais\ning steel and concrete in the construction of many storied buildings. We pose the\nfollowing problem.\nExercise 3.4\nShow that truss member AC carries a tensile load of 8W, the diagonal\nmember BC a compressive load of √2 W, and member BD a compressive\nload of 7W. Then show that these three forces are equivalent to a vertical\nforce of magnitude W and a couple directed counter clockwise of magnitude\nWL.\nL = 8 h\nW\nA\nC\nE\nB\nD\nh\nWe could, at this point, embark on a method of joints, working our way from\nthe right-most node, from which the weight W is suspended, to the left, node by\nnode, until we reach the two nodes at the support pins at the wall. We will not\nadopt that time consuming procedure but take a short cut. We cut the structure\naway from the supports at the wall, just to the right of the points A and B, and con\nstruct the isolation shown below:\nL = 8 h\nW\nA\nC\nE\nB\nD\nFAC\nFBD\nFBC\no\nh\nThe diagram shows that I have taken the unknown, member forces to be posi\ntive in tension; F\nand FBC are shown pulling on node C and FBD pulling on node\nAC\nD according to my usual convention. Force equilibrium in the horizontal and ver\ntical directions respectively gives\n⁄\n-F AC - ( 2 2) ⋅ FBC - FBD = 0\nand\n-( 2 ⁄ 2)FBC -W = 0\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nwhile moment equilibrium about point B, taking counter clockwise as positive yields\n⋅\n- (8h) ⋅ W = 0\nh F AC\nSolution produces the required result, namely\nF\n= 8W;\nF\n= - √2 W;\nF\n= - 7W\nAC\nBC\nBD\nThe negative sign in the result for FBC means that the internal force is oppo\nsitely directed from what was assumed in drawing the free-body diagram; the\nmember is in compression rather than tension. So too for member BD; it is also in\ncompression. The three member forces are shown compressive or tensile accord\ning to the solution, in the isolation below, at the left. In the middle we show a stat\nically equivalent system, having resolved the compressive force in BC into a\nvertical component, magnitude W, and a horizontal component magnitude W, then\nsumming the latter with the horizontal force 7W. On the right we show a statically\nequivalent system acting at the same section, AB - a vertical force of magnitude W\nand a couple of magnitude 8W h= W L directed counter clockwise.\nA\nC\nE\nB\nD\n8 W\n7 W\n√2 W\no\nA\nC\nE\nB\nD\n8 W\n8W\nW\nA\nC\nE\nB\nD\nW\nWL\nObserve:\n- The identity of this truss structure with the cantilever beam of Galileo is\nto be noted, i.e., how the moment of the weight W about the point B is bal\nanced by the couple WL acting at the section AB. The two equal and\nopposite forces of magnitude 8W separated by the distance h = L/8 are\nequivalent to the couple WL.\n- The most important member forces, those largest in magnitude, are the\ntwo members AC and BD. The top member AC is in tension, carrying 8W,\nthe bottom member BD in compression, carrying 7W. The load in the\ndiagonal member is relatively small in magnitude; it carries 1.4W in com\npression.\n- Note if I were to add more bays to the structure, extending the truss out to\nthe right from 8h to 10h, to even 100h, the tension and compression in the\ntop and bottom members grow accordingly and approach the same magni\ntude. If L= 100h, then F\n= 100W, F\n= 99W, while the force in the\nAC\nBD\n\nChapter 3\ndiagonal member is, as before, 1.4W in compression! Its magnitude rela\ntive to the aforementioned tension and compression becomes less and less.\nWe faulted Galileo for not recognizing that there must be a vertical, reaction\nforce at the root of the cantilever. We see now that maybe he just ignored it\nbecause he knew from his (faulty)9analysis that it was small relative to the inter\nnal forces acting normal to the cross section at AB. Here is his achievement: he\nsaw that the mechanism responsible for providing resistance to bending within a\nbeam is the tension (and compression) of its longitudinal fibers.\nExercise 3.5\nA force per unit area, a stress σ, acts over the cross section AB as shown\nbelow. It is horizontally directed and varies with vertical position on AB\naccording to\nσ y\n⋅\ny\n( ) = c yn\n-(h ⁄ 2) ≤\n≤(h ⁄ 2)\nIn this, c is a constant and n a positive integer.\nIf the exponent n is odd show that\n(a) this stress distribution is equivalent to a couple alone (no resultant force),\nand\n(b) the constant c, in terms of the couple, say M0, may be expressed as\n⋅(\nc = (n\n+ ) ⋅M0 ⁄ [2b\nh\n\n⁄ 2)n\n+ ]\ny\nσ(y)b∆y\ny\nx\nσ\nn\ny=+h/2\ny=-h/2\nA\nb\nb\n(y) = cy\n9. We see how the question of evaluating Galileo's work as correct or faulty becomes complex once we move\nbeyond the usual text-book, hagiographic citation and try to understand what he actually did using his writ\nings as a primary source. See Kuhn, THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS, for more on the\ndistortion of history at the hands of the authors of text-books in science and engineering.\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nFirst, the resultant force: A differential element of force, ∆F = σ(y)b∆y acts on\neach differential element of the cross section AB between the limits y = ± h/2.\nNote the dimensions of the quantities on the right: σ is a force per unit area; b a\nlength and so too ∆y; their product then is a force alone. The resultant force, F, is\nthe sum of all these differential elements of force, hence\nh ⁄ 2\nh ⁄ 2\nF = ∫σ y\nd\nb y\n( )b y = c\nyn ⋅ d\n∫\n- h ⁄ 2\n- h ⁄ 2\nIf the exponent n is odd, we are presented with the integral of an odd function,\n- σ(y)= σ(-y), between symmetric limits. The sum, in this case, must be zero.\nHence the resultant force is zero.\nThe resultant moment is obtained by summing up all the differential elements\nof moment due to the differential elements of force. The resultant moment will be\na couple; indeed, it can be pictured as the sum of the couples due to a differential\nelement of force acting at +y and a paired differential element of force, oppositely\ndirected, acting at -y. We can write, as long as n is odd\nh ⁄ 2\nh ⁄ 2\nM0 = 2 ∫y ⋅σ y\nd\nb y\n( )b y = 2 c\nyn\n+ ⋅ d\n∫\nCarrying out the integration, we obtain\n2 cb\nM0 = ----------------- ⋅(h ⁄ 2 )n\n+\n(n\n+ )\nSo c can be expressed in terms of M0 as\nc = (n\n+ ) ⋅M ⁄ [2 b\nh ⁄ 2 )n\n+ ]\n⋅(\nas we were asked to show.\nNow we imagine the section AB to be a section at the root of Galileo's cantile\nver. We might then, following Galileo, claim that if the maximum value of this\nstress, which is engendered at y= + h/2, reaches the failure stress in a tension test\nthen the cantilever will fail. At the top of the beam the maximum stress expressed\nin terms of M0 is found to be, using our result for c,\nσ(y=h/2 ) = 2 (n\n+ ) ⋅M ⁄ (bh2 )\n\nChapter 3\nNow observe:\n- The dimensions are correct: Sigma, a stress, is a force per unit area. The\ndimensions of the right hand side are the same - the ratio of force to length\nsquared.\n- There are many possible odd values of n each of which will give a differ\nent value for the maximum stress σ at the top of the beam. The problem, in\nshort, is statically indeterminate. We cannot define a unique stress distri\nbution satisfying moment equilibrium nor conclude when the beam will\nfail.\n- If we arbitrarily choose n = 1, i.e., a linear distribution of stress across\nthe cross section AB, and set M0 = WL, the moment at the root of an end-\nloaded cantilever, we find that the maximum stress at y = h/2 is\nσ\n⁄\n⁄\n= 6 ⋅(L h) ⋅(W bh)\nmax\n- Note the factor L/h: As we increase the ratio of length to depth while hold\ning the cross sectional area, bh, constant -- say (L/h) increases from 8 to\n10 or even to 100 -- the maximum stress is magnified accordingly. This\n\"levering action\" of the beam in bending holds for other values of the\nexponent n as well! We must credit Galileo with seeing the cantilever\nbeam as an angular lever. Perhaps the deficiency of his analysis is rooted\nin his not being conversant with the concept of couple, just as students\nlearning engineering mechanics today, four hundred years later, will err in\ntheir analyses, unable, or unwilling, to grapple with, and appropriate for\ntheir own use, the moment due to two, or many pairs of, equal and oppo\nsite forces as a thing in itself.\n- If we compare this result with what Galileo obtained, identifying σmaximum\nabove with σfailure of the member in tension, we have a factor of 6 where\nGalileo shows a factor of 2. That is, from the last equation, we solve for\nW with σmaximum = σfailure and find\nW failure = --6(h L) ⋅ bh ⋅σ failure\n⁄\n- The beam is a redundant structure in the sense that we can take material\nout of the beam and still be left with a coherent and usuable structure. For\nexample, we might mill away material, cutting into the sides, the whole\nlength of the beam as shown below and still be left with a stable and possi\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nbly more efficient structure --A beam requiring less material, hence less\ncost, yet able to support the design loads.\nExercise 3.6\nThe cross section of an I beam looks like an \"I\". The top and bottom parts\nof the \"I\" are called the flanges; the vertical, middle part is called the web.\nIf you assume that:\ntop flange\ni) the web carries no load, no normal stress\nii) a uniformly distributed normal stress is carried\nweb\nI\nby the top flange\nbottom flange\niii) a uniformly distributed normal stress is carried\nby the bottom flange\nI\nI beam\niv) the top and bottom flanges have equal cross sec\ntional areas.\nthen show that\na) the resultant force, acting in the direction of the length of the beam is\nzero only if the stress is tensile in one of the flanges and compressive in the\nother and they are equal in magnitude;\nb) in this case, the resultant moment, about an axis perpendicular to the\nweb, is given by\nM0 = h\nbt ⋅\n⋅(\n) σ\n\nwhere h is the height of the cross section, b the breadth of the flanges, t\ntheir thickness.\n\nChapter 3\nThe figure at the right\nshows our I beam. Actu\nally it is an abstraction of\nan I beam. Our I beam,\nσtop = σ\ny\nx\nA\nb\nz\n- σ\nt\ny=+h/2\nwith its paper thin web,\nunable to carry any stress,\nwould fail immediately.10\nBut our abstraction is\nnot\nuseless;\nit\nis\nan\napproximation to the way\nσbottom =\nan I beam carries a load in\ny=-h/2\nbending. Furthermore, it\nis a conservative approxi\nmation in the sense that if the web does help carry the load (as it does), then the\nstress levels we obtain from our analysis, our model, should be greater than those\nseen by the flanges in practice.\nIn a sense, we are taking advantage of the indeterminacy of the problem -- the\nproblem of determining the stress distribution over the cross section of a beam in\nterms of the applied loading -- to get some estimate of the stresses generated in\nan I beam. What we are asked to show in a) and b) is that the requirements of\nstatic equilibrium may be satisfied by this assumed stress distribution. (We don't\nworry at this point, about force equilibrium in the vertical direction).\nThe figure shows the top flange in tension and the bottom in compression.\nAccording to the usual convention, we take a tensile stress as positive, a compres\nsive stress as negative. It should be clear that there is no resultant force in the hor\nizontal direction given the conditions i) through iv). That is, force equilibrium in\nthe (negative) x direction yields\nbt\nbt\nσtop ⋅(\n)\n\n+ σbottom (\n)\n\n⋅\n= 0\n\nif\n\nσbottom = -σtop\nThe resultant moment is not zero.\nThe resultant moment about the 0z axis,\ntaking them counter clockwise, is just\nM0 = σtop ⋅ bt ⋅(h ⁄ 2)-σbottom ⋅ bt ⋅(h ⁄ 2) = 2σtop ⋅ bt ⋅(h ⁄ 2) = σ ⋅ bth\nwhere I have set σtop = σ and σ bottom = - σ.\nWith this result, we can estimate the maximum stresses in the top and bottom\nflanges of an I beam. We can write, if we think of M0 as balancing the end load W\nof our cantilever of length L so that we can set\nM0 = WL, and obtain:\n⁄\n⁄\nσ\n= (L h) ⋅(W bt\n)\nmax\nThis should be compared with results obtained earlier for a beam with a rectan\ngular cross section.\n10. No I beam would be fabricated with the right-angled, sharp, interior corners shown in the figure; besides\nbeing costly, such features might, depending upon how the beam is loaded, engender stress concentrations\n-- high local stress levels.\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nWe can not resolve the indeterminacy of the problem and determine when an I\nbeam, or any beam for that matter, will fail until we can pin down just what nor\nmal stress distribution over the cross section is produced by an internal moment.\nFor this we must consider the deformation of the beam, how the beam deforms due\nto the internal forces and moments.\nBefore going on to that topic, we will find it useful to pursue the behavior of\nbeams further and explore how the shear force and bending moment change with\nposition along a span. Knowing these internal forces and moments will be prereq\nuisite to evaluating internal stresses acting at any point within a beam.\nShear Force and Bending Moment in Beams\nIndeed, we will be bold and state straight out, as conjecture informed by our study\nof Galileo's work, that failure of a beam in bending will be due to an excessive\nbending moment. Our task then, when confronted with a beam, is to determine the\nbending moment distribution that is, how it varies along the span so that we can\nascertain the section where the maximum bending moment occurs.\nBut first, a necessary digression to discuss sign conventions as they apply to\ninternal stresses, internal forces, and internal moments. I reconsider the case of a\nbar in uniaxial tension but now allow the internal stress to vary along the bar. A\nuniform, solid bar of rectangular cross section, suspended from above and hanging\nvertically, loaded by its own weight will serve as a vehicle for explanation.\nskyhook\nF(z)\nw(z) = γ Az\ny\nz\nx\nF(z) = γ Az\nz\nF(z)\nF(z)\nz\n∆z\nF(z) + ∆F\nF(z) = γ Az\n∆w(z) = γ A∆z\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nThe section shown at (a) is a true free body diagram of a portion of the bar: the\nsection has length \"z\", so in that sense it is of arbitrary length. The section expe\nriences a gravitational force acting vertically downward; its magnitude is given by\nthe product of the weight density of the section, γ, say in pounds per cubic inch,\nand the volume of the section which, in turn, is equal to the product of the cross\nsectional area, A, and the length, z. At the top of the section, where it has been\n\"cut\" away from the rest above, an internal, tensile force acts which, if force equi\n\nChapter 3\nlibrium is to be satisfied, must be equal to the weight of the section, w(z). By\nconvention we say that this force, a tensile force, is positive.\nThe section of the bar shown at (b) is not a true free body diagram since it is\nnot cut free of all supports (and the force due to gravity, acting on the section, is\nnot shown). But what it does show is the \"equal and opposite reaction\" to the\nforce acting internally at the cut section, F(z).\nThe section of the bar show at (c) is infinitely thin. It too is in tension. We\nspeak of the tensile force at the point of the cut, at the distance z from the free\nend. What at first glance appear to be two forces acting at the section -- one\ndirected upward, the other downward -- are, in fact, one and the same single\ninternal force. They are both positive and have the same magnitude.\nTo claim that these two oppositely directed forces are the same force can create\nconfusion in the minds of those unschooled in the business of equal and opposite\nreactions; but that's precisely what they are. The best way to avoid confusion is to\ninclude in the definition of the direction of a positive internal force, some specifi\ncation of the surface upon which the force acts, best fixed by the direction of the\noutward normal to the surface. This we will do. In defining a positive truss mem\nber force, we say the force is positive if it acts on a surface whose outward point\ning normal is in the same direction as the force acting on the surface. The force\nshown above is then a positive internal force -- a tension.\nThe section shown at (d) is a differential section (or element). Here the same\ntensile force acts at z (directed downward) but it is not equal in magnitude to the\ntensile force acting at z+∆z, acting upward at the top of the element. The differ\nence between the two forces is due to the weight of the element, ∆w(z).\nTo establish a convention for the shear force and bending moment internal to a\nbeam, we take a similar approach. As an example, we take our now familiar canti\nlever beam an make an isolation of a section of span starting at some arbitrary dis\ntance x out from the root and ending at the right end, at x = L. But instead of an\nend load, we consider the internal forces and moments due to the weight of the\nbeam itself. Figure (a) shows the magnitude of the total weight of the section act\ning vertically downward due to the uniformly distributed load per unit length, γA,\nwhere γ is the weight density of the material and A the cross-sectional area of the\nbeam.\nThe section is a true free\nbody diagram of a portion of\nMB\nx\nV\nL\nweight = γ A(L-x)\nx\ny\n(a)\nthe beam: the section has\nlength L-x, so in that sense it\nis of arbitrary length. At the\nleft of the section, where it z\nhas been \"cut\" away from the\nrest of the beam which is\nattached to the wall, we show an internal force and (bending) moment at x. We\ntake it as a convention, one that we will adhere to throughout the remainder of this\ntext, that the shear force and the bending moment are positive as shown. We\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\ndesignate the shear force by V, following tradition, and the bending moment by\nM .\nb\nNow this particular conven\ntion requires elaboration: First\n(b)\nV\nMB\nMB\nMB\nV\nMB(x)\nMB (x)+∆MB(x)\nV(x)+\nx\nx\nx+∆x\n∆V(x)\nz\nx\nx\ny\ny\n∆w = γ A∆x\nV(x)\nV\ny\nconsider the rest of the cantilever\nbeam that we cut away. Figure\n(b) shows the equal and opposite\nreactions to the internal force\nand moment shown on our free\nbody diagram in figure (a). (b) is\n(c)\nnot a true free body diagram\nsince it is not cut free of all sup\nports and the force due to gravi\nz\ntyis not shown.\nThe section\nof the beam\nshown at (c) is infinitely thin.\n(d)\nHere, what appears to be two\nforces is in fact one and the same\nx\ninternal force -- the shear force,\nV, acting at the section x. They\nz\nare both positive and have the\nsame magnitude. Similarly what\nappears to be two moments is in\nfact one and the same internal\nmoment -- the bending moment, MB , acting at the position x.\nWe show a positive shear force acting on the left face, a face with an outward\nnormal pointing in the negative x direction, acting downward in the a negative y\ndirection. It's equal and opposite reaction, the same shear force, is shown acting\non the right face, a face with an outward normal pointing in the positive x direc\ntion, acting upward in a positive y direction. Our convention can then be stated as\nfollows: A positive shear force acts on a positive face in a positive coordinate\ndirection or on a negative face in a negative coordinate direction.\nA positive face is short for a face whose outward nor-\ny\nmal is in a positive coordinate direction.\nThe convention\nfor positive bending moment is the same but now the\ndirection of the moment is specified according to the right\nMB\nMB\nV\nx\nhand rule. We see that on the positive x face, the bending\nmoment is positive if it is directed along the positive z\naxis. A positive bending moment acts on a positive face\nV\nin a positive coordinate direction or on a negative face\nin a negative coordinate direction. Warning: Other textbooks use other conven\ntions. It's best to indicate your convention on all exercises, including in your\ngraphical displays the sketch to the right.\n\nChapter 3\nExercise 3.7\nConstruct a graph that shows how the bending moment varies with distance\nalong the end-loaded, cantilever beam.

Note that the reactions shown at the wall, at x=0, are displayed accord\ning to their true directions; they can be considered the applied forces for this\nalternate, free body diagram.\nExercise 3.8\nw(x) = wo\nx\nx\nx + ∆x\nV + ∆V\nMb+∆Mb\nMb\nV\nwo ∆x\nx=L\nforce/unit length\nShow that for the uniformly loaded, beam simply supported at its ends, the\nfollowing differential relationships among the distributed load w0, the\nshear force V(x), and the bending moment Mb(x), hold true, namely\nV\nd\n= w0\nand\nMb\n-\n= V\nx\nx\nd\nThe differential relations among the shear force,\nV(x), the bending moment, Mb(x) and the distributed\nload w0 are obtained from imagining a short, differen\ntial element of the beam of length ∆ x, cut out from the\nbeam at some distance x In this particular problem we\nMb\nV\ny\nV + ∆V\nMb+∆Mb\nwo\nx\n∆x\nx+∆x\nx\nare given a uniformly distributed load.

Note the difference between this differen\ntial element sketched here and the pictures drawn in defining a convention for\n\nChapter 3\npositive shear force and bending moment: They are alike but they are to be read\ndifferently. The sketch used in defining our convention shows the internal force\nand moment at a point along the span of the beam; the sketch above and in (d)\nshows how the internal force and moment change over a small, but finite, length of\nspan - over a differential element.\nFocusing on the isolation of this differential element of the beam, force equi\nlibrium requires\n-\nV\nw ⋅∆x + (V + ∆V) = 0\no\nand moment equilibrium, about the point x, counter clockwise positive, yields\nx\nMb( ) - w0 ⋅∆x ⋅(∆x ⁄ 2) + (V + ∆V) ⋅∆x + Mb + ∆Mb = 0\nWe simplify, divide by ∆x, let ∆x approach zero and obtain for the ratios ∆V/∆\nx and ∆M /∆x in the limit\nb\ndV\nd\nx\nd\n= w0\nand\nMb = -V\nx\nd\nas was desired.\nNote how, because the factor ∆x appears twice in the w0 term in the equation\nof moment equilibrium, it drops out upon going to the limit. We say it is second\norder relative to the other leading order terms which contain but a single factor ∆\nx The latter are leading order after we have canceled out the Mb, - M\nterms.\nb\nKnowing well the sign convention for positive shear force and bending moment is\ncritical to making a correct reading of these differential equations. These general\nequations themselves -- again, w could be a function of x, w(x), and our deriva\ntion would remain the same --s can be extremely useful in constucting shear force\nand bending moment distributions. That's why I've placed a box around them.\nFor example we might attempt\nto construct the shear force and bending\nmoment distributions by seeking integrals for these two, first order, differential\nequations. We would obtain, since w0 is a constant\nV x\nx\n( ) = w0 ⋅x + C1\nand\nMb( ) = w0 ⋅(x 2 ⁄ 2) + C1 ⋅x + C2\nBut how to evaluate the two constants of integration? To do so we must know\nvalues for the shear force and bending moment at some x position, or positions,\nalong the span.\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nNow, for our particular situation, we must have\nthe bending moment vanish at the ends of the beam\nsince there they are simply supported -- that is, the\nMb=0\nsupports offer no resistance to rotation hence the\ninternal moments at the ends must be zero. This is\nV\nbest shown by an isolation in the vicinity of one of\nthe two ends.\nReaction =\nwo L/2\nWe require, then, that the following two bound\nary conditions be satisfied, namely\nat x=0,\nMb = 0\nand at x=L,\nMb = 0\nThese two yield the following expressions for the two constants of integration,\nC1 and C2.\nC1 = -w0 ⋅(L ⁄ 2)\nand\nC2= 0\nand our results for the shear force and bending moment distributions become:\nV x\n-\n( ) = w0 ⋅(x\nL\n\n⁄ 2)\nw0 L2\nMb( ) = ------------ ⋅[(x L)2 - (x L)]\nx\n⁄\n⁄\nUnfortunately, this way of determining the shear force and bending moment\ndistributions within a beam does not work so well when one is confronted with\nconcentrated, point loads or segments of distributed loads. In fact, while it works\nfine for a continuous, distributed load over the full span of a beam, as is the case\nhere, evaluating the constants of integration becomes cumbersome in most other\ncases. Why this is so will be explored a bit further on.\nGiven this, best practice is to determine the shear force and bending moment\ndistributions from an isolation, or sequence of isolations, of portion of the beam.\nThe differential relationships then provide a useful check on our work.\nHere is\nhow to proceed:\nWe first determine the reactions at the supports at the left and right ends of the\nspan.\nx\nL\nw0\ny\nw0L/2\nw0L/2\n\nChapter 3\nNote how I have re-positioned the axis system to take advantage of symme-\ntry.11\nSymmetry suggests, and a free body diagram of\nthe entire beam together with application of force\ny\nV\nand moment equilibrium would show, that the hori-\nMb\nzontal reactions at the ends are zero and the vertical\nx\nreactions are the same, namely w L/2.\nWe isolate a portion of the beam to\ny\nthe right of some arbitrarily chosen sta\ntion x. The choice of this section is not\nquite arbitrary: We made a cut at a posi\ntive x, a practice highly recommended\nto avoid sign confusions when writing\nout expressions for distances along the\nspan in applying moment equilibrium.\nL/2\nx\nV\nwo\nMb\nBelow right, we show the same iso-\ny\nlation but have replaced the load w dis\ntributed over the portion of the span x to\nL/2, by an equivalent system, namely a\nforce of magnitude w0[(L/2)-x] acting\ndownward through a point located mid\nway x to L/2. Applying force equilib\nrium to the isolation at the right yields:\nV\nMb\n(L/2- x)/2\n(L/2- x)\nwo L/2\nwo (L/2- x)\nwo L/2\n- V x\n( ) - w0 ⋅[(L ⁄ 2) - x] + w0 ⋅(L ⁄ 2) = 0\nwhile taking moments about the point x, counter clockwise positive, yields\nx\nMb( ) - w0 ⋅[(L ⁄ 2) - x][(L ⁄ 2) - x] ⁄ 2 + (w0L ⁄ 2)[(L ⁄ 2) - x]= 0\n11. Note how the loading looks a bit jagged; it is not really a constant,as we move along the beam. While the\neffects of this \"smoothing\" of the applied load can not really be determined without some analysis which\nallows for the varying load, we note that the bending moment is obtained from an integration, twice over, of\nthe distributed load. Integration is a smoothing operation. We explore this situation further on.\nx\nx\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nSolution of these yields the shear force and bending moment distributions shown below.\nWe show the uniform load distribution as well.\ny\nx\nMb(x) = (w0/2)[(L/2)2 - x ]\nx\nx\nL\nwo\nwo L/2\nwo L/2\nV (x)\n- wo L/2\n+wo L/2\n+L/2\n- L/2\nwo L2/8\nMb(x)\nObserve:\n- How by taking moments about the point x, the shear force does not appear\nin the moment equilibrium equation. The two equations are uncoupled, we\ncan solve for Mb(x) without knowing V.\n- These results are the same as obtained from our solution of the differential\nequations. They do not immediately appear to be identical because the \"x\"\nis measured from a different position. If you make an appropriate change\nof coordinate, the identity will be confirmed.\n- Another way to verify their consistency is to see if the differential rela\ntionships, which apply locally at any position x, are satisfied by our more\nrecent results. Indeed they are: The slope of the shear force distribution is\nequal to the distributed load w0 at any point x. The slope of the bending\nmoment distribution is equal to the negative of the shear force V(x).\n- The bending moment is zero at both ends of the span. This confirms our\nreading of circles as frictionless pins, unable to transmit a couple.\n-\nThe bending moment is a maximum at mid-span. M = w L /8. Note\nb\nthat the shear force is zero at mid-span, again in accord with our differen\ntial relationship12\n- Last, but not least, the units check. For example, a bending moment has\nthe dimensions FL, force times length; the distributed load has dimensions\nF/L, force per unit length; the product of w and L2 then has the dimen\nsions of a bending moment as we have obtained.\nw(x) = wo\nV(x) = wo x\n\nChapter 3\nFor another look at the use of the differential relationships as aids to construct\ning shear force and bending moment distributions we consider a second exercise:\nExercise 3.9\nConstruct shear force and bending\nmoment diagrams for the simply-sup-\ny\nL/4\nwo (x)\na\nL/2\nL/4\nP\nported beam shown below. How do your\ndiagrams change as the distance a\napproaches zero while, at the same time,\nx\nthe resultant of the distributed load,\nw0(x) remains finite and equal to P?\nWe start with the limiting case of a con\ny\nP\nP L/4\ncentrated load acting at the point to the left\nL/4\nof center span. Two isolations of portions of\nx\nthe beam to the left are made at some arbi\ntrary x - first with x less than L/4, (middle 0\nfigure), then in the region L/4<x<3L/4, (bot\ntom figure)- are shown.\nL\nSymmetry again requires that the verti-\nP\nP\ncal reactions are equal and of magnitude P.\nx\nP\nV\nMb\nP\nx\nV\nP\nMb\ny\ny\nNote this remains true when we consider the\ndistributed load w0(x) centered at x= L/4 as\nx\nlong as its resultant is equivalent to the con\ncentrated load P.\nForce and moment equilibrium for\n0< x < L/4 yields\nV x\n( ) = -P\nand\nx\nx\n⋅\nMb( ) = P x\nwhile for L/4 < x < 3L/4 we have\n12. One must be very careful in seeking maximum bending moments by seting the shear to zero. One of the\ndisastrous consequences of studying the differential calculus is that one might think the locus of a maximum\nvalue of a function is always found by equating the slope of the function to zero. Although true in this prob\nlem, this is not always the case. If the function is discontinuous or if the maximum occurs at a boundary then\nthe slope need not vanish yet the function may have its maximum value there. Both of these conditions are\noften encountered in the study of shear force and bending moment distributions within beams.\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nV x\n( ) = P\nP\n-\n= 0\nand\nMb x\n( ) P x\n⋅\n=\n- P\nx\n(\n⋅\n- L 4\n⁄\n)\nP L 4\n⁄\n⋅\n=\nNow for the x > 3L/4 we could proceed by making a third isolation, setting x >\n3L/4 but rather than pursue that tack, we step back and construct the behavior of\nthe shear force and bending moment in this region using less machine-like, but\njust as rigorous language, knowing the behavior at the end points and the differen\ntial relations among shear force, bending moment, and distributed load.\nThe distributed load is zero for x>3L/4. Hence the shear force\ny\nV\nMb must be a constant. But what constant value? We know that the\nreaction at the right end of the beam is P acting upward. Imag\nx\nining an isolation of a small segment of the beam at x ≈L, you\nsee that the shear force must equal a positive P. I show the con\nvention icon at the right to help you imagine the a true isolation at x=L.\nIn the region, 3L/4 < x < L we have,\nthen\nV x\n( ) = P\nFor the bending moment in this\nregion we can claim that if the shear\nforce is constant, then the bending\nx\nP\nP\nL\nL/4\nL/4\nx\ny\n+P\nL\nL/4\nL/4\n+PL/4\nL/4\nL/4\nx\na\nP\nP\nmoment must be a linear function of x\nwith a slope equal to -V , i.e., = -P. The\nbending moment must then have the\nform\nM x\n+\n( ) = -P ⋅x\nC\nwhere C is a constant. But the bending V(x)\nmoment at the right end is zero. From this\nwe can evaluate C, conclude that the bend-\nx\ning moment is a straight line, zero at x=L\nand with slope equal to -P, i.e., it has the\nform:\nMb( ) = P\nL\n\n- x)\n-P\nx\n⋅(\nI have also indicated the effect of\ndistributing the load P out over a finite\nsegment, a of the span, centered at x=L/\n4. Since the distributed P is equivalent\nMb(x)\nto a w(x), acting downward as positive,\nthen the slope of the shear V must be\npositive according to our differential\nrelationship relating the two. The bend\ning moment too changes, is smoothed\nas a result, its slope, which is equal to\nV, is less for x<L/4 and greater than it was for x>L/4.\n\nChapter 3\nWe see that the effect of distributing a concentrated load is to eliminate the dis\ncontinuity, the jump, in the shear force at the point where the concentrated load is\napplied. We also see that the discontinuity in the slope of the bending moment dis\ntribution at that point dissolves.\nNow while at first encounter, dealing with functions that jump around can be\ndisconcerting, reminiscent of all of that talk in a mathematics class about limits\nand their existence, we will welcome them into our vocabulary. For although we\nknow that concentrated loads are as rare as frictionless pins, like frictionless pins,\nthey are extremely useful abstractions in engineering practice. You will learn to\nappreciate these rare birds; imagine what your life would be like if you had to\ncheck out the effect of friction at every joint in a truss or the effect of deviation\nfrom concentration of every concentrated load P?\nOne final exercise on shear force and bending moment in a beam:\nExercise 3.10\nEstimate the magnitude of the maximum bending moment due to the uniform\nloading of the cantilever beam which is also supported at its end away from\nthe wall.\nw(x) = wo\nx\nx=L\nwo L\nL\nM0\nL/2\nforce/unit length\nRo\nRL\nWe first determine, or try to determine, the reactions at the wall and at the\nroller support at the right end.\nForce and moment equilibrium yield,\nR0 - w0 L + RL = 0\nand\n-M0 - w0(L2 ⁄ 2) + RL ⋅ L = 0\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nHere moments have been taken about left end, positive counterclockwise. Also, I have\nreplaced the uniformly distributed load, w0 with a statically equivalent load equal to its\nresultant and acting at midspan.\nNow these are two equations but there are three unknown reactions, RO, RL,\nMO. The problem is indeterminate, the structure is redundant; we could remove\nthe support at the right end and the shelf would still work to hold up the books,\nassuming we do not overload the, now cantilevered, structure. But with the sup\nport at the right in place, life is hard, or at least more complex.\nBut wait; all that was asked was an estimate of the maximum bending moment.\nLet us press on; we are not without resources. In fact, our redundant structure\nlooks something like the previous exercise involving a uniformly loaded beam\nwhich was simply supported at both ends. There we found a maximum bending\nmoment of woL2/8 which acted at mid span. There! There is an estimate!13 Can we\ndo better? Possibly. (See Problem 3.1)\nWe leave beam bending for now. We have made considerable progress although\nwe have many loose ends scattered about.\n- What is the nature of the stress distribution engendered by a bending\nmoment?\n- How can we do better analyzing indeterminate structures like the one\nabove?\nWe will return to answer these questions and pick up the loose ends, in Chapter\n8. For now we turn to two quite different structural elements - circular shafts in\ntorsion, and thin cylinders under internal or external pressure - to see how far we\ncan go with equilibrium alone in our search for criteria to judge, diagnose and\ndesign structures with integrity.\n13. This is equivalent to setting the resistance to rotation at the wall, on the left, to zero.\n\nChapter 3\n3.3\nInternal Moments in Shafts in Torsion\nBy now you get the picture: Structures come in different types, made of different\nelements, each of which must support internal forces and moments. The pin-\nended elements of a truss structure can carry \"uni-axial\" forces of tension or com\npression. A beam element supports internal forces and moments -\n\"transverse\"\nshear forces and bending moments. (A beam can also support an axial force of\ntension or compression but this kind of action does not interact with the shear\nforce and bending moment - unless we allow for relatively large displacements of\nthe beam, which we shall do in the last chapter). We call a structure made up of\nbeam elements a \"frame\".\nStructural elements can also twist about their axis. Think of the drive shaft in\nan automobile transmission. The beam elements of a frame may also experience\ntorsion. A shaft in torsion supports an internal moment, a torque, about it's\n\"long\" axis of rotation.\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nExercise 3.11\nEstimate the torque in the shaft RH appearing in the figure below\nThis figure, of a human-powered pump, is taken from THE VARIOUS AND\nINGENIOUS MACHINES OF AGOSTINO RAMELLI, a sixteenth century, late\nRenaissance work originally published in Italian and French.\n\nChapter 3\nWe isolate pieces of the\nstructure in turn, starting with\nRBy\nRAx\nFtooth\nrN\nW\nrs\nRBx\nDrum S\nRAy\nthe drum S upon its shaft at the\ntop of the machine, then pro\nceed to the vertical shaft RH to\nestimate the torque it bears. We\nassume in all of our fabrications\nthat the bearings are friction\nless, they can support no torque,\nthey provide little resistance to\nrotation.14\nWe show the reactions at the\ntwo bearings as R\nand R .\nA\nB\nTheir values are not of interest;\nwe need only determine the\nforce acting on the teeth of the wheel N, labeled Ftooth, in order to reach our goal.\nMoment equilibrium about the axis of the shaft yields\nFtooth = W ⋅(r ⁄ r )\nx\nn\nwhere W is the weight of the water bucket, assumed full of water, r is the radius of the\nS\ndrum S, and r the radius of the wheel N out to where the internal force acting between the\nN\nteeth of wheel N and the \"rundles\" of the \"lantern gear\" R.\nWe now isolate the vertical shaft, rather a top\nsection of the vertical shaft, to expose the internal\ntorque, which we shall label M . On this we show\nMT\nrR\nFtooth\nT\nthe equal and opposite reaction to the tooth force\nacting on the wheel N, using the same symbol Ftooth.\nWe let r\nbe the radius of the lantern gear. We\nR\nleave for an end-of-chapter exercise the problem of\ndetermining the reaction force at the bearing (not\nlabeled) and another at the bottom of the shaft.\nMoment equilibrium about the axis of the shaft\nyields\n14. This is an adventurous assumption to make for the sixteenth century but, in the spirit of the Renaissance and\nNeo-platonic times, we will go ahead in this fashion. The drawings that are found in Ramelli's book are an\nadventure in themselves. Page after page of machinery - for milling grain, cranes for lifting, machines for\ndragging heavy objects without ruining your back, cofferdams, military screwjacks and hurling engines, as\nwell as one hundred and ten plates of water-raising devices like the one shown here - can be read as a celebra\ntion of the rebirth of Western thought, and that rebirth extended to encompass technology. This, in some ways\nexcessive display of technique - many of the machines are impractical, drawn only to show off - has its par\nallel in contemporary, professional engineering activity within the academies and universities. Witness the\nexcessive production of scholarly articles in the engineering sciences whose titles read like one hundred and\nten permutations on a single fundamental problem.\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nMT =\n⋅ rR\nFtooth\nor, with our expression for Ftooth\nMT = W rR ⋅ r ⁄ rN)\n(\ns\nNow for some numbers. I take 60 pounds as an estimate of the weight W. I take\nsixty pounds because I know that a cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds and the\nvolume of the bucket looks to be about a cubic foot. I estimate the radius of the\ndrum to be r\n= 1 ft, that of the wheel to be three times bigger, r\n= 3 ft, and\nS\nN\nfinally the radius of the lantern gear to be r\n= 1 ft. Putting this all together pro-\nR\nduces an estimate of the torque in the shaft of\nM ≈ 20 ft.lb\nT\nIf Ramelli were to ask, like Galileo, when the shaft HR might fail, he would be\nhard pressed to respond. The reason? Assuming that failure of the shaft is a local,\nor microscopic, phenomenon, he would need to know how the torque M estimated\nT\nabove is distributed over a cross section of the shaft. The alternative would be to\ntest every shaft of a different diameter to determine the torque at which it would\nfail.15\nWe too, will not be able to respond at this point. Again we see that the problem\nof determining the stresses engendered by the torque, more specifically, the shear\nstress distribution over a cross section of the shaft, is indeterminate. Still, as we\ndid with the beam subject to bending, let us see how far we can go.\nWe need, first, to introduce the notion of shear stress. Up to this point we have\ntoyed with what is called a normal stress, normal in the sense that it acts perpen\ndicular to a surface, e.g., the tensile or compressive stress in a truss member. A\nshear stress acts parallel to a surface.\nThe figure at the right shows a thin-walled\nMT\ntube loaded in torssion by a torque (or moment)\nMT.\nThe bit cut out of the top of the tube is\nmeant to show a shear stress τ, distributed over\nthe thickness and acting perpendicular to the t\nradius of the tube. It acts parallel to the surface;\nwe say it tends to shear that surface over the one\nbelow it; the cross section rotates a bit about the\naxis relative to the cross sections below.\nI claim that if the tube is rotationally symmet-\nτ\nR\nMT\nric, that is, its geometry and properties do not\n15. A torque of 20 ft-lb. is not a very big torque. The wooden shaft RH would have to be extremely defective or\nvery slender to have a torque of this magnitude cause any problems. Failure of the shaft is unlikely. On the\nother hand, we might ask another sort of question at this point: What force must the worker erert to raise the\nbucket of water? Or, how fast must he walk round and round to deliver water at the rate of 200 gallons per\nhour? At this rate, how many horse power must he supply? Failure in this mode is more likely.\n\n--------------\nChapter 3\nchange as you move around the axis of the tube, then each bit of surface will look\nthe same as that shown in the figure. Furthermore, if we assume that the shear is\nuniformly distributed over the thickness of the tube we can figure out how big the\nshear stress is in terms of the applied torque and the geometry of the tube.16\nThe contribution to the torque of an angular segment of arc length R∆θ will be\nτ R∆θ\n⋅\nt⋅\n: the element of force\ntimes the radius\nτ R2∆θ\n⋅\n⋅ t\n: the element of torque\nso integrating around the surface of the tube gives a resultant\n2πR2t τ\n⋅\nwhich must equal the applied torque, hence\nτ =\nMT\n2πR2t\n-\nNote that the dimensions of shear stress are force per unit area as they should\nbe.\nExercise 3.12\nShow that an equivalent system to the torque MT acting about an axis of a\nsolid circular shaft is a shear stress distribution τ(r,θ) which is independent\nof θ but otherwise an arbitrary function of r.\nMT\nr\nτ(r)\nMT\nr\n∆θ\n∆Α\nThree End Views\nWe show such an arbitrary shear stress τ, a force per unit area, varying from\nzero at the axis to some maximum value at the outer radius R. We call this a\nmonotonically increasing function of r. It need not be so specialized a function but\nwe will evaluate one of this kind in what follows.\nWe show too a differential element of area ∆ A = (r∆θ)(∆ r), where polar coor\ndinates are used. We assume rotational symmetry so the shear stress does not\nchange as we move around the shaft at the same radius. Again, the stress distribu\ntion is rotationally symmetric, not a function of the polar coordinate θ. With this,\n16. This is reminiscent of our analysis of an I beam.\n\nInternal Forces and Moments\nfor this distribution to be equivalent to the torque MT, we must have, equating\nmoments about the axis of the shaft:\n⋅\nMT =\nr ⋅[τ ∆A]\n∫\nArea\nwhere the bracketed term is the differential element of force and r is the moment arm of\neach force element about the axis of the shaft.\nTaking account of the rotational symmetry, summing with respect to θ intro-\nduces a factor of 2π and we are left with\nr = R\nMT = 2 π\nτ r( ) ⋅r 2 r\nd\n∫\nr\n=\nwhere R is the radius of the shaft.\nThis then shows that we can construct one, or many, shear stress distribution(s)\nwhose resultant moment about the axis of the cylinder will be equivalent to the\ntorque, MT. For example, we might take\n( ) = c rn\nτ r\n⋅\nwhere n is any integer, carry out the integration to obtain an expression for the constant c\nin terms of the applied torque, MT. This is similar to the way we proceeded with the beam.\n3.4\nThin Cylinder under Pressure\nThe members of a truss structures carry the load in tension or compression. A cyl\ninder under pressure behaves similarly in that the most significant internal force is\na tension or compression. And like the truss, if the cylinder is thin, the problem of\ndetermining these internal forces is statically determinate, or at least approxi\nmately so. A few judiciously chosen isolations will enable us to estimate the ten\nsile and compressive forces within making use, as always, of the requirements for\nstatic equilibrium. If, in addition, we assume that these internal forces are uni\nformly distributed over an internal area, we can estimate when the thin cylindrical\nshell might yield or fracture, i.e., we can calculate an internal normal stress. We\nput off an exploration of failure until later. We restrict our attention here to con\nstructing estimates of the internal stresses.\nConsider first an isolation that cuts the thin shell with a plane perpendicular to\nthe cylinder's axis.\n\nChapter 3\nWe assume that the cylinder is internally pressur\nized. In writing equilibrium, we take the axial force\ndistributed around the circumference, fa, to be uni\nformly distributed as it must since the problem is\nrotationally symmetric.\nNote that fa, has dimen\nsions force per unit length. For equilibrium in the\nvertical direction:\npiπR2\nf a\nR\nt\n⋅\n2πR\nf\n= pi ⋅πR2\na\nSolving for this distributed, internal force we find\nf = pi ⋅(R ⁄ 2)\na\nIf we now assume further that this force per unit length of circumference is\nuniformly distributed over the thickness, t, of the cylinder, akin to the way we\nproceeded on the thin hollow shaft in torsion, we obtain an estimate of the tensile\nstress, a force per unit area of the thin cross section, namely\nObserve that the stress σ can be very much larger than the\na\ninternal pressure if the ratio of thickness to radius is small.\nFor a thin shell of the sort used in aerospace vehicles, tank\ntrailers, or a can of coke, this ratio may be on the order of\n0.01. The stress then is on the order of 50 times the internal\npressure. But this is not the maximum internal normal stress! Below is a second isolation,\nthis time of a circumferential section.\nσa\npi\nR 2t\n⁄\n(\n)\n⋅\n=\nEquilibrium of this isolated body\nt\nrequires that\npi ⋅(2Rb) = 2b f θ\nR\nb\npi(2Rb)\nfθ\nwhere fθ is an internal, again tensile,\nuniformly distributed force per unit\nlength acting in the \"theta\" or hoop\ndirection. Note: We do not show the\npressure and the internal forces acting\nin the axial direction. These are self\nequilibrating in the sense that the ten\nsile forces on one side balance those\non the other side of the cut a distance b along the cylinder. Note also how, in writing the\nresultant of the internal pressure as a vertical force alone, we have put to use the results of\nsection 2.2.\nSolving, we find\nf θ = pi ⋅ R\n\nChapter 3\nIf we again assume that the force per unit length in the axial direction is also\nuniformly distributed over the thickness, we find for the hoop stress\nσθ\npi\nR t⁄\n(\n)\n⋅\n=\nwhich is twice as big as what we found for the internal stress acting internally, parallel to\nthe shell's axis. For really thin shells, the hoop stress is critical.\n\nChapter 3\nDesign Exercise 3.1\nLow-end Diving Board\na\nL\nYou are responsible for the design of a complete line of diving boards within a\nfirm that markets and sells worldwide.

The brackets are supported by two fasteners A and B as\nshown that are somehow anchored to the wall material (1/2 inch sheetrock, for\nexample. A shelf is then usually place on top of the brackets. There is provision to\nfasten the shelf to the brackets, but this is often not done.

      "content": "Stress\nWe have talked about internal forces, distributed them uniformly over an area and\nthey became a normal stress acting perpendicular to some internal surface at a\npoint, or a shear stress acting tangentially, in plane, at the point. Up to now, the\nchoice of planes upon which these stress components act, their orientation within\na solid, was dictated by the geometry of the solid and the nature of the loading.\nWe have said nothing about how these stress components might change if we\nlooked at a set of planes of another orientation at the point. And up to now, we\nhave said little about how these normal and shear stresses might vary with posi\ntion throughout a solid.1\nNow we consider a more general situation, namely an arbitrarily shaped solid\nwhich may be subjected to all sorts of externally applied loads - distributed or\nconcentrated forces and moments.\nWe are going to lift our gaze up from the\nworld of crude structural elements such as truss bars in tension, shafts in torsion,\nor beams in bending to view these \"solids\" from a more abstract perspective. They\nall become special cases of a more general stuff we call a solid continuum.\nLikewise, we develop a more general and more abstract representation of inter\nnal forces, moving beyond the notions of shear force, internal torque, uni-axial\ntension or compression and internal bending moment. Indeed, we have already\ndone so in our representation of the internal force in a truss element as a normal\nstress, in our representation of torque in a thin-walled, circular shaft as the result\nant of a uniformly distributed shear stress, in our representation of internal forces\nin a cylinder under internal pressure as a hoop stress (and as an axial stress). We\nwant to develop our vocabulary and vision in order to speak intelligently about\nstress in its most general form.\nWe address two questions:\n- How do the normal and shear components of stress acting on a plane at a\ngiven point change as we change the orientation of the plane at the point.\n- How might stresses vary from one point to another throughout a contin\nuum;\nThe first bullet concerns the transformation of components of stress at a point;\nthe second introduces the notion of stress field. We take them in turn.\n1. The beam is the one exception. There we explored how different normal stress distributions over a rectangu\nlar cross-section could be equivalent to a bending moment and zero resultant force.\n\nChapter 4\n4.1\nStress: The Creature and its Components\nWe first address what we need to know to fully define \"stress at a point\" in a\nsolid continuum. We will see that the stress at a point in a solid continuum is\ndefined by its scalar components. Just as a vector quantity, say the velocity of a\nprojectile, is defined by its three scalar components, we will see that the stress at\na point in a solid continuum is defined by its nine scalar components.\nNow you are probably quite familiar with vector quantities - quantities that\nhave three scalar components. But you probably have not encountered a quantity\nlike stress that require more than three scalar values to fix its value at a point.\nThis is a new kind of animal in our menagerie of variables; think of it as a new\nspecies, a new creature in our zoo. But don't let the number nine trouble you. It\nwill lead to some algebraic complexity, compared to what we know how to do\nwith vectors, but we will find that stress, a second order tensor, behaves as well as\nany vector we are familiar with.\nThe figure below is meant to illustrate the more general, indeed, the most gen\neral state of stress at a point. It requires some explanation:\ny\nz\nσx\nσz\nσxz\nσzy\nσzx\nσyx\nyx\nP\nσy\nσyz\nx\ny\nz\nx\ny\nz\nx\ny\nz\nσxy\nThe odd looking structural element, fixed to the ground at bottom and to the\nleft, and carrying what appears to be a uniformly distributed load over a portion of\nits bottom and a concentrated load on its top, is meant to symbolize an arbitrarily\nloaded, arbitrarily constrained, arbitrarily shaped solid continuum. It could be a\nbeam, a truss, a thin-walled cylinder though it looks more like a potato -- which\ntoo is a solid continuum. At any arbitrarily chosen point inside this object we can\nask about the value of the stress at the point, say the point P. But what do we mean\nby \"value\"; value of what at that point?\nThink about the same question applied to a vector quantity: What do we mean\nwhen we say we know the value of the velocity of a projectile at a point in its tra\njectory? We mean we know its magnitude - its \"speed\" a scalar - and its direction.\nDirection is fully specified if we know two more scalar quantities, e.g., the direc\ntion the vector makes with respect to the axes as measured by the cosine of the\nangles it makes with each axis. More simply, we have fully defined the velocity at\n\nStress\na point if we specify its three scalar components with respect to some reference\ncoordinate frame - say its x, y and z components.\nNow how do we know this fully defines the vector quantity? We take as our\ncriterion that anyone, anyone in the world (of mathematical physicists and engi\nneers), would agree that they have in hand the same thing, no matter what coordi\nnate frame they favor, no matter how they viewed the motion of the projectile.\n(We do insist that they are not displacing or rotating relative to one another, i.e.,\nthey all reside in the same inertial frame). This is assured if, after transforming the\nscalar components defined with respect to one reference frame to another, we\nobtain values for the components any other observer sees.\nIt is then the equations which transform the values of the components of the\nvector from one frame to another which define what a vector is. This is like defin\ning a thing by what it does, e.g., \"you are what you eat\", a behaviorists perspec\ntive - which is really all that matters in mathematical physics and in engineering.\nReid: Hey Katie: what do you think of all this talk about components? Isn't\nhe going off the deep end here?\nKatie: What do you mean, \"...off the deep end\"?\nReid: I mean why don't we stick with the stuff we were doing about beams\nand trusses? I mean that is the useful stuff. This general, abstract continuum\nbusiness does nothing for me.\nKatie: There must be a reason, Reid, why he is doing this. And besides, I\nthink it is interesting; I mean have you ever thought about what makes a vec\ntor a vector?\nReid: I know what a vector is; I know about force and velocity; I know they\nhave direction as well as a magnitude. So big deal. He is maybe just trying\nto snow us with all this talk about transformations.\nKatie: But the point is what makes force and velocity the same thing?\nReid: Their not the same thing!\nKatie: He is saying they are - at a more abstract, general level. Like....like\nrobins and bluebirds are both birds.\nReid: And so stress is like tigers, is that it?\nKatie: Yeah, yeah - he said a new animal in the zoo.\nReid: Huh... pass me the peanuts, will you?\nWe envision the components of stress as coming in sets of three: One set acts\nupon what we call an x plane, another upon a y plane, a third set upon a z plane.\nWhich plane is which is defined by its normal: An x plane has its normal in the x\ndirection, etc. Each set includes three scalar components, one normal stress com\nponent acting perpendicular to its reference plane, with its direction along one\n\nz\nChapter 4\ncoordinate axis, and two shear stress components acting in plane in the direction\nof the other two coordinate axes.\nThat's a grand total of nine stress components to\ndefine the stress at a point. To fully define the\ny\nz\nσx\nσz\nσxz\nσzy\nσzx\nσyx\nyx\nσy\nσyz\nσxy\nstress field throughout a continuum you need to\nspecify how these nine scalar components. Fortu\nnately, equilibrium requirements applied to a differ\nential element of the continuum, what we will call a\n\"micro-equilibrium\" consideration, will reduce the\nnumber of independent stress components at a point\nfrom nine to six. We will find that the shear stress\ncomponent σxy acting on the x face must equal its\nneighbor around the corner σyx acting on the y face\nand that σ = σ and σxz = σzx accordingly.\nFortunately too, in most of the engineering structures you will encounter, diag\nnose or design, only two or three of these now six components will matter, that is,\nwill be significant. Often variations of the stress components in one, or more, of\nthe three coordinate directions may be uniform. But perhaps the most important\nsimplification is a simplification in modeling, made at the outset of our encounter.\nOne particularly useful model, applicable to many structural elements is called\nPlane Stress and, as you might infer from the label alone, it restricts our attention\nto variations of stress in two dimensions.\nzy\nyz\nPlane Stress\nIf we assume our continuum has the form of a thin plate of uniform thickness but\nof arbitrary closed contour in the x-y plane, our previous arbitrarily loaded, arbi\ntrarily constrained continuum (we don't show these again) takes the planar form\nbelow.\nh\nA point\nx\ny\nσx\nσxy\nσy\nσyx\nno stresses here\non this z face\nA point\nσx\nσy\nσy\nσxy\nσyx\nσxy\nσyx\nL\nz\nσx\nBecause the plate is thin in the z direction, (h/L << 1 ) we will assume that\nvariations of the stress components with z is uniform or, in other words, our stress\ncomponents will be at most functions of x and y. We also take it that the z bound\nary planes are unloaded, stress-free. These two assumptions together imply that\n\nStress\nσ\nthe set of three \"z\" stress components that act upon any arbitrarily located z plane\nwithin the interior must also vanish. We will also take advantage of the micro-\nequilibrium consequences, yet to be explored but noted previously, and set σyz and\nxz to zero. Our state of stress at a point is then as it is shown on the exploded view\nof the point - the block in the middle of the figure - and again from the point of\nview of looking normal to a z plane at the far right. This special model is called\nPlane Stress.\nA Word about Sign Convention:\nσ\nThe figure at the far right seems to include\nmore stress components than necessary;\nafter all, if, in modeling, we eliminate the\nstress components acting on a z face and\nyz and σxz as well, that should leave, at\nmost, four components acting on the x and\ny faces. Yet there appear to be eight in the\nfigure. No, there are only at most four\ncomponents; we must learn to read the fig\nure.\nσx\nσxy\nA\nA\nA\nA\nσx\nσxy\nσy\nσyx\nσ\nσyx\nA\nx\ny\ny\nTo do so, we make use of another sketch of\nA point\ny\nstress at a point, the point A. The figure at\nσ\nσ\nσ\nyx\nthe top is meant to indicated that we are\nxy\nlooking at four faces or planes simulta-\nσx\nneously. When we look at the x face from\nthe right\nwe are looking at the\nσx\nσxy\nstress components on a positive x face -- it\nyx\nσ\nhas its outward normal in the positive x\nσ\ny\ndirection -- and a positive normal stress,\nby convention, is directed in the positive x direction. A positive shear stress com\nponent, acting in plane, also acts, by convention, in a positive coordinate direc\ntion - in this case the positive y direction.\nOn the positive y face, we follow the same convention; a positive σy acts on a\npositive y face in the positive y coordinate direction; a positive σyx acts on a posi\ntive y face in the positive x coordinate direction.\nWe emphasize that we are looking at a point, point A, in these figures. More\nprecisely we are looking at two mutually perpendicular planes intersecting at the\npoint and from two vantage points in each case. We draw these two views of the\ntwo planes as four planes in order to more clearly illustrate our sign convention.\nBut you ought to imagine the square having zero height and width: the σx acting to\nthe left, in the negative x direction, upon the negative x face at the left, with its\noutward normal pointing in the negative x direction is a positive component at the\npoint, the equal and opposite reaction to the σx acting to the right, in the positive\nx direction, upon the positive x face at the right, with its outward normal pointing\nin the positive x direction. Both are positive as shown; both are the same quan\n\nChapter 4\ntity. So too the shear stress component σxy shown acting down, in the negative y\ndirection, on the negative x face is the equal and opposite internal reaction to σxy\nshown acting up, in the positive y direction, on the positive x fac\nA general statement of our sign convention, which holds for all nine compo\nnents of stress, even in 3D, is as follows:\nA positive component of stress acts on a positive face in a positive coordi\nnate direction or on a negative face in a negative coordinate direction.\nTransformation of Components of Stress\nBefore constructing the equations which fix how the components of stress\ntransform in general, we consider a simple example of a bar suspended vertically\nand illustrate how components change when we change our reference frame at a\npoint. In this example, we take the weight of the bar to be negligible relative to\nthe weight suspended at its free end and explore how the normal and shear stress\ncomponents at a point vary as we change the orientation of a plane.\nExercise 4.1\nThe solid column of rectangular cross section measuring a × b supports a\nweight W. Show that both a normal stress and a shear stress must act on any\ninclined interior face. Determine their respective values assuming that both\nare uniformly distributed over the area of the inclined face. Express your\nestimates in terms of the ratio (W/ab) and the angle φ.\nFor equilibrium of the isolation of a section of\nb\na\nFn\nFt\nφ\nφ\nφ\nthe column shown at the right, a force equal to\nthe suspended weight (we neglect the weight of\nthe column itself) must act upward. We show an\nequivalent force system -- or, if you like, its\nA\ncomponents consisting of two perpendicular\nφ forces, one directed normal to the inclined\nplane, the other with its line of action in the\nplane inclined at the angle φ. We have\nF\n= W ⋅ cos φ\nand\nFt = W ⋅ sin φ\nn\nNow if we assume these are distributed uni-\nW\nW\nformly over the section, we can construct an\nestimate of the normal stress and the shear stress\nacting on the inclined face. But first we must establish the area of the inclined\nface Aφ. From the geometry of the figure we see that the length of the inclined\nplane is b/cosφ so the area is\nAφ = (ab) ⁄ (cos φ)\nWith this we write the normal and shear stress components as\n\n------\nStress\nW\nW\nn\nn\n\n------\nsin\nσ\n= F ⁄ Aφ =\n⋅cos φ\nand\nσt = Ft ⁄ Aφ =\n⋅cos φ\nφ\n\nab\n\nab\nThese results clearly illustrate how the values for the normal and shear stress\ncomponents of a force distributed over a plane inside of an object depends upon\nhow you look at the point inside the object in the sense that the values of the shear\nand normal stresses at a point within a continuum depend upon the orientation\nof the plane you have chosen to view.\nWhy would anyone want to look at some arbitrarily oriented plane in an object,\nseeking the normal and shear stresses acting on the plane? Why do we ask you to\nlearn how to figure out what the stress components on such a plane might be?\nThe answer goes as follows: One of our main concerns as a designer of struc\ntures is failure --fracture or excessive deformation of what we propose be built\nand fabricated. Now many kinds of failures initiate at a local, microscopic level.\nA minute imperfection at a point in a beam where the local stress is very high ini\ntiates fracture or plastic deformation, for example. Our quest then is to figure out\nwhere, at what points in a structural element, the normal and shear stress compo\nnents achieve their maximum values.\nBut we have just seen how these values\ndepend upon the way we look at a point, that is, upon the orientation of the plane\nwe choose to inspect. To ensure we have found the maximum normal stress at a\npoint for example, we would then have to inspect every possible orientation of a\nplane passing through the point.2\nThis seems a formidable task. But before taking it on, we pose a prior ques\ntion:\nExercise 4.2\nWhat do you need to know in order to determine the normal and shear\nstress components acting upon an arbitrarily oriented plane at a point in a\nfully three dimensional object?\nThe answer is what we might anticipate from our original definition of six\nstress components for if we know these six scalar quantities3, the three normal\nstress components σx, σy, and σz, and the three shear stress components σxy, σyz,\nand σxz, then we can find the normal and shear stress components acting upon an\narbitrarily oriented plane at the point. That is the answer to our need to know\nquestion.\nTo show this, we derive a set of equations that will enable you to do this. But\nnote: we take the six stress components relative to the three orthogonal, let's call\n2. Much as we have done in the preceding exercise. Our analysis shows that the maximum normal stress acts on\nthe horizontal plane, defined by φ =0. The maximum shear stress, on the other hand acts on a plane oriented\nat 45o to the horizontal. The factor cosφ sin φ has a maximum at φ = 45o.\nxz,\nzy\n3. We take advantage of moment equilibrium and take σ yx = σ xy, σzx = σ\nand σ\n= σyz.\n\nChapter 4\nthem, x,y,z planes as given, as known quantities. Furthermore, again we restrict\nour attention to two dimensions - the case of Plane Stress. That is we say that the\ncomponents of stress acting on one of the planes at the point - we take the z planes\n- are zero. This is a good approximation for certain objects -- those which are thin\nin the z direction relative to structural element's dimensions in the x-y plane. It\nalso, makes our derivation a bit less tedious, though there is nothing conceptual\ncomplex about carrying it through for three dimensions, once we have it for two.\nIn two dimensions we can draw a simpler picture of the state of stress at a\npoint. We are not talking differential element here but of stress at a point. The fig\nure below shows an arbitrarily oriented plane, defined by its normal, the x' axis,\ninclined at an angle φ to the horizontal.

Knowing these three numbers, we can determine the\nnormal and shear stress components acting on any plane defined by the orientation\nφ as follows.\nConsider equilibrium of the shaded wedge shown. Here we let Aφ designate the\narea of the inclined face at a point, A and A the areas of the x face with its out\nx\ny\nward normal pointing in the -x direction and of the y face with its outward normal\npointing in the -y direction respectively. In this we take a unit depth into the paper.\nWe have\nA\n= Aφ ⋅cos φ\nand\nAy = Aφ ⋅sin φ\nx\nThat takes care of the relative areas. Now for force equilibrium, in the x and y\ndirections we must have:\n- σ ⋅A - σ\n⋅A + (σ' ⋅cos φ - σ' xy ⋅sin φ) ⋅Aφ = 0\nx\nx\nxy\ny\nx\nand\n-\n- σ\n⋅A - σ ⋅A + (σ' ⋅sin φ + σ' xy ⋅cos φ) ⋅Aφ = 0\nxy\nx\ny\ny\nx\nIf we multiply the first by cosφ, the second by sinφ and add the two we can eliminate σ' .\nWe obtain\nxy\nσ' Aφ-σ cos φA - σxycos φA - σ\nsin φA -σ sin φA\n= 0\nx\nx\nx\ny\nxy\nx\ny\ny\n\n---------------------\n---------------------\n---------------------\n---------------------\n---------------------\nStress\nwhich, upon expressing the areas of the x,y faces in terms of the area of the inclined face,\ncan be written (noting Aφ becomes a common factor).\nσ' = σ cos φ2 + σ sin φ + 2σ\nsin φcos φ\nx\nx\ny\nxy\nIn much the same way, multiplying the first equilibrium equation by sinφ, the second by\ncosφ but subtracting rather than adding you will obtain eventually\nσ'\n= (σy -σ )sin φcos φ + σxy(cos φ2 - sin φ )\nxy\nx\nWe deduce the normal stress component acting on the y' face of this rotated\nframe by replacing φ in our equation for σ' by φ + π/2. We obtain in this way:\nx\nσ' = σ cos φ2 + σ sin φ -2σ\nsin φcos φ\ny\ny\nx\nxy\nThe three transformation equations for the three components of stress at a\npoint can be expressed, using the double angle formula for the cosine and the sine,\nas\nσ' x\nσx\nσy\n+\n(\n)\n-\nσx\nσy\n-\n(\n)\n-\n2φ\ncos\n⋅\nσ xy\n2φ\nsin\n+\n+\n=\nσ' y\nσx\nσy\n+\n(\n)\n-\nσx\nσy\n-\n(\n)\n-\n2φ\ncos\n⋅\n-\nσxy\n-\n2φ\nsin\n=\nσ' xy\nσx\nσy\n-\n(\n)\n-\n-\n2φ\nsin\n⋅\nσ xy\n2φ\ncos\n+\n=\nHere we have the equations to do what we said we could do. Think of the set as\na machine: You input the three components of stress at a point defined relative to\nan x-y coordinate frame, then give me the angle φ, and I will crank out -- not only\nthe normal and shear stress components acting on the face with its outward normal\ninclined at the angle φ with respect to the x axis, but the normal stress on the y'\nface as well. In fact I could draw a square tilted at an angle φ to the horizontal\nand show the stress components σ' x, σ' y and σ'xyacting on the x' and y' faces.\nTo show the utility of these relationships consider the following scenario:\nExercise 4.3\nAn solid circular cylinder made of some brittle material is subject to pure\ntorsion --a torque Mt. If we assume that a shear stress τ(r) acts within the\ncylinder, distributed over any cross section, varying with r according to\nτ( ) = c rn\nr\n⋅\nwhere n is a positive integer, then the maximum value of τ, will occur at the\nouter radius of the shaft.\n\nChapter 4\nBut is this the maximum value? That is, while certainly rn is maximum at the\noutermost radius, r=R, it may very well be that the maximum shear stress acts on\nsome other plane at that point in the cylinder.\nShow that the maximum shear stress is indeed that which acts on a plane nor\nmal to the axis of the cylinder at a point on the surface of the shaft.\nShow too, that the maximum normal stress in the cylinder acts\n- at a point on the surface of the cylinder\n-\non a plane whose normal is inclined 45o to the x axis and its value is\nσ'\n= τ R\n( )\nx max\nWe put to use our machinery for\nMt\ny\nx\nx'\nφ\nφ\nσxy\nσ' xy\nτ(r=R)\nA point\nσ' x\nσxy =τ(R)\ny'\ny\nx\ncomputing the stress components\nacting upon an arbitrarily oriented\nplane at a point. Our initial set of\nstress components for this particu\nlar state of stress is\nσ\n= 0\nx\nσ\n= 0\ny\nand\nσ\n= τ R\n( )\nxy\ndefined relative to the x-y coordinate\nframe shown top right. Our equations\ndefining the transformation of compo\nnents of stress at the point take the sim\npler form\nσ' = τ ⋅sin 2φ\nx\nσ' = -τ ⋅sin 2φ\nMt\ny\nσ'\n= τ ⋅cos 2φ\nxy\nTo find the maximum value for the shear stress component with respect to the\nplane defined by φ, we set the derivative of σ'\nto zero. Since there are no \"bound\nxy\naries\" on φ to worry about, this ought to suffice.\nSo, for a maximum, we must have\ndσ' xy = -2τ ⋅sin 2φ = 0\ndφ\n\nStress\nNow there are many values of φ which satisfy this requirement, φ=0, φ=π/2, ...... But all\nof these roots just give the orientation of the of our initial two mutually perpendicular, x-y\nplanes. Hence the maximum shear stress within the shaft is just τ at r=R.\nTo find the extreme, including maximum, values for the normal stress, σ' we\nx\nproceed in much the same way; differentiating our expression above for σ' with\nx\nrespect to φ yields\ndσ' x = 2τ ⋅ cos 2φ = 0\n(EQ 1)\ndφ\nAgain there is a string of values of φ, each of which satisfies this requirement.\nWe have 2φ = π/2, 3π/2\n....... or φ = π/4, 3π/4\nAt φ = π/4 (= 45o), the value of the normal stress is σ' = + τ sin2φ = τ.\nSo\nx\nthe maximum normal stress acting at the point on the surface is equal in magni\ntude to the maximum shear stress component.\nNote too that our transformation relations\ny\nsay that the normal stress component acting\nσxy\noriginal\nstate of stress\non the y' plane, with φ=π/4 is negative and\nequal in magnitude to τ. Finally we find that\nσ\nσ\nthe shear stress acting on the x'-y' planes is\nxy\nxy=+τ(R)\nzero! We illustrate the state of stress at the\npoint relative to the x'-y' planes below right.\nx\nσxy\nBacking out of the woods in order to see\nthe trees, we claim that if our cylinder is\nσ' xy = 0\nmade of a brittle material, it will fracture\nσ' x = +τ (R)\ny\nφ\nx'\nσ' = -τ (R)\nacross the plane upon which the maximum\ntensile stress acts. If you go now and take a\npiece of chalk and subject it to a torque until\n= 45o\nit breaks, you should see a fracture plane in\nx\nthe form of a helical surface inclined at 45\ndegrees to the axis of the cylinder. Check it\nout.\nOf course it's not enough to know the orientation of the fracture plane when\ndesigning brittle shafts to carry torsion. We need to know the magnitude of the\ntorque which will cause fracture. In other words we need to know how the shear\nstress does in fact vary throughout the cylinder.\nThis remains an unanswered question. So too for the beam: How do the nor\nmal stress (and shear stress) components vary over a cross section of the beam? In\na subsequent section, we explore how far we can go with equilibrium consider\nation in responding. But, in the end, we will find that the problem remains stati\ncally indeterminate; we will have to go beyond the concept of stress and consider\nthe deformation and displacement of points in the continuum. But first, a special\ntechnique for doing the transformation of components of stress at a point. \"Mohr's\n\n---------------------\n---------------------\n---------------------\n---------------------\n---------------------\nChapter 4\nCircle\" is a graphical technique which, while offering no new information, does\nprovide a different and useful perspective on our subject.\nStudying Mohr's Circle is customarily the final act in this first stage of indoc\ntrination into concept of stress. Your uninitiated colleagues may be able to master\nthe idea of a truss member in tension or compression, a beam in bending, a shaft in\ntorsion using their common sense knowledge of the world around them, but\nMohr's Circle will appear as a complete mystery, an unfathomable ritual of signs,\ncircles, and greek symbols. Although it does not tell us anything new, over and\nabove all that we have done up to this point in the chapter, once you've mastered\nthe technique it will set you apart from the crowd and shape your very well being.\nIt may also provide you with a useful aid to understanding the transformation of\nstress and strain at a point on occasion.\nMohr's Circle\nOur working up of the transformation relations for stress and our exploration\nof their implications for determining extreme values has required considerable\nmathematical manipulation. We turn now to a graphical rendering of these rela\ntionships. I will set out the rules for constructing the circle for a particular state of\nstress, show how to read the pattern, then comment about its legitimacy. I first\nrepeat the transformation equations for a two-dimensional state of stress.\nσ' x\nσx\nσy\n+\n(\n)\n-\nσx\nσy\n-\n(\n)\n-\n2φ\ncos\n⋅\nσ xy\n2φ\nsin\n+\n+\n=\nσ' y\nσx\nσy\n+\n(\n)\n-\nσx\nσy\n-\n(\n)\n-\n2φ\ncos\n⋅\n-\nσxy\n-\n2φ\nsin\n=\nσ' xy\nσx\nσy\n-\n(\n)\n-\n-\n2φ\nsin\n⋅\nσ xy\n2φ\ncos\n+\n=\nσ\nTo construct Mohr's Circle, given the state of stress\nσ x = 7, σ xy= 4, and\ny = 1 we proceed as follows: Note that I have dropped all pretense of reality in this\nchoice of values for the components of stress. As we shall see, it is their relative magni\ntudes that is important to this geometric construction. Everything will scale by any com\nmon factor you please to apply. You could think of these as σx =7x103 KN/m2...etc., if you\nlike.\n\nChapter 4\n- Lay out a horizontal axis and label it σ positive to the right.\nσ\n- Lay out an axis perpendicular to the above and label it σ positive down\nxy\nand σ positive up4.\nyx\nσ\nσyx\nσxy\n- Plot a point associated with the stress components acting on an x face at\nthe coordinates (σ ,σ )=(7,4down).

This takes a little\nmore effort to prove.\nEnough. Now onto the second topic of the chapter - the variation of stress com\nponents as we move throughout the continuum. This is prerequisite if we seek to\nfind extreme values of stress.\n4.2\nThe Variation of Stress (Components) in a\nContinuum\nTo begin, we re-examine the case of a bar suspended vertically but now con\nsider the state of stress at each and every point in the continuum engendered by its\nown weight. (Note, I have changed the orientation of the reference axes). We will\nx\ny\nz\nF(y) + ∆F\nσ(y) + ∆σ\n∆y\n∆y\ny\n∆w(y) = γ A∆y\nσ(y)\nF(y)\nconstruct a differential equation which governs how the axial stress varies as we\nmove up and down the bar. We will solve this differential equation, not forgetting\nto apply an appropriate boundary condition and determine the axial stress field.\nWe see that for equilibrium of the differential element of the bar, of planar\ncross-sectional area A and of weight density γ, we have\n\nChapter 4\nF + ∆F - γ\nA\n⋅\n⋅∆y - F = 0\nIf we assume the tensile force is uniformly distributed over the cross-sectional area, and\ndividing by the area (which does not change with the independent spatial coordinate y) we\ncan write\n+\n- ⋅\n⁄\nσ\n∆σ\nγ\n∆y - σ = 0\nwhere\nσ ≡F A\nChanting \"...going to the limit, letting ∆y go to zero\", we obtain a differential equation fix\ning how σ(y), a function of y, varies throughout our continuum, namely\ndσ - γ = 0\ny\nd\nWe solve this ordinary differential equation easily, integrating once and obtain\nσ y\n=\n( ) γ ⋅y + Cons\nt\ntan\nThe Constant is fixed by a prescribed condition at some y surface; If the end of the bar is\nstress free, we indicate this writing\nat y = 0\nσ = 0\nso\nσ y\n=\n( ) γ ⋅y\nIf, on another occasion, a weight of magnitude P0 is suspended from the free end, we\nwould have\nat y = 0\nσ = P0 ⁄ A\nand\nσ y\n=\n( ) γ ⋅y + P0 ⁄ A\nHere then are two stress fields for two different loading conditions6. Each\nstress field describes how the normal stress σ(x,y,z) varies throughout the contin\nuum at every point in the continuum. I show the stress as a function of x and z as\nwell as y to emphasize that we can evaluate its value at every point in the contin\nuum, although it only varies with y. That the stress does not vary with x and z was\nimplied when we stipulated or assumed that the internal force, F, acting upon any\ny plane was uniformly distributed over that plane. This example is a special case\nin another way; not only is it one-dimensional in its dependence upon spatial posi\ntion, but it is the simplest example of stress at a point in that it is described fully\nby a single component of stress, the normal stress acting on a plane perpendicular\nto the y axis.\n6. A third loading condition is obtained by setting the weight density γ to zero; our bar then is assumed weight\nless relative to the end-load P0.\n\nChapter 4\nStress Fields & \"Micro\" Equilibrium\nIn our analysis of how the normal stress varied throughout the vertically sus\npended bar, we considered a differential element of the bar and constructed a dif\nferential equation which described how the normal stress component varied in one\ndirection, in one spatial dimension.\nWe can call this picture of equilibrium\n\"micro\" in nature and distinguish it from the \"macro\" equilibrium considerations\nof the last chapter. There we isolated large chunks of structure e.g., when we cut\nthrough the beam to see how the shear force and bending moment varied with dis\ntance along the beam.\nNow we look with finer resolution and attempt to determine how the normal\nand shear stress components vary at the micro level throughout the beam. The\nquestion may be put this way: Knowing the shear force and bending moment at\nany section along the beam, how do the normal and shear stress components vary\nover the section?\nTo proceed, we make some appropriate assumptions about the nature of the\nbeam and build upon the conjectures we made in the last chapter about how the\nstress components might vary.\n\nChapter 4\nWe model the end-loaded cantile\nver with relatively thin rectangular\ncross-section as a plane stress problem.\nIn this, b is the \"thin\" dimension, i.e.,\nb/L <1.\nIf we assume a normal stress distri\nbution over an x face is proportional to\nsome odd power of y, as we did in\nChapter 3, our state of stress at a point\nmight look like that shown in figure\n(c). In this, σ would have the form\nx\n,\n(\n, ,\n(\nσ (x y) = C n b h) ⋅W L - x)yn\nx\nwhere C(n,b,h) is a constant which depends\nupon the cross-sectional dimensions of the\nbeam and the odd exponent n. The factor\nW(L-x) is the magnitude of the internal\nbending moment at the location x mea\nsured from the root. See figure (b).\nh\nW\nL\nx\ny\nz\n(a)\npoint A\nσx(x,y)\npoint A\nb\n(c)\nσx(x,y)\nW\nW(L-x)\nx\nW\npoint A\n(b)\nx\ny\nBut this is only one component of\nour stress field. What are the other\ncomponents of stress at point A?\n(d)\npoint A\nσxy\nOur plane stress model allows us to\nσx\nclaim that the three z face components\nare zero and if we take σyz and σxz to be\nσx\nzero, that still leaves σxy,and σ in addi-\nσxy\ntion to σx.\nTo continue our estimation process,\nwe make the most of what we already know: For example, we know that a shear\nforce of magnitude W acts at any x section. For the end-loaded cantilever, neglect\ning the weight of the beam itself, it does not vary with x. We might assume, then,\nthat the shear force is uniformly distributed over the cross-section and set\ny\nσ\n= -W ⁄ (bh)\nOur stress at a point at point A would then look like\nxy\nfigure (d).\nWe could, of course, posit other shear stress distributions at any x station,\ne.g., some function like σxy = Constant ⋅ym where m is an integer and the con\nstant is determined from the requirement that the resultant force due to this shear\nstress distribution over the cross section must be W.\nThe component σy - how it varies with x and y - remains a complete\nunknown. We will argue that it is small, relative to the normal and shear stress\ncomponents, moved by the observation that the normal stress on the top and the\n\nChapter 4\nbottom surfaces of the beam is zero; we say the top and bottom surfaces are\n\"stress free\". Continuing, if σy vanishes there at the bounary, then it probably\nwill not grow to be significant in the interior. This indeed can be shown to be the\ncase if h/L << 1, as it is for a beam. So we estimate σy=0.\nBut there is something more\nwe can do. We can look at equilibrium\nof a differerential element within the\nbeam and, as we did in the case of a\nbar hung vertically, construct a differ\nential equation whose solution (sup\nplemented\nwith\nsuitable\nboundary\nconditions) defines how the normal\nand shear stress components vary\nthoughout the plane, with x and y.\nActually we construct more than a sin\ngle differential equation: We obtain\ntwo, coupled, first-order, partial differ\nential equations for the normal and\nh\nW\nL\ny\nz\n(a)\npoint A\nb\nσy+ ∆σy\nσxy + ∆σxy\nelement\nσyx\nσy\nx\nx\ny\nσxy\nσx\ny + ∆y\ny\nx + ∆x\nσx + ∆σx\nσyx + ∆σyx\nBy\nA differential\nBx\nshear stress components.\nThink now, of a differential element\nin 2D at any point withinthe cantilever\nbeam: We show such on the right. Note\nnow we are no longer focused on two\nintersecting, perpendicular planes at a\npoint but on a differential element of\nthe continuum. Now we see that the stress components may very well be different\non the two x faces and on the two y faces.\nWe allow the x face components, and those on the two y faces to change as we\nmove from x to x+∆x (holding y constant) and from y to y+∆y (holding x con\nstant).\nWe show two other arrows on the figure, Bx and By. These are meant to repre\nsent the x and y components of what is called a body force. A body force is any\nexternally applied force acting on each element of volume of the continuum. It is\nthus a force per unit volume. For example, if we need consider the weight of the\nbeam, By would be just\nB\n= -γ\nwhere\nγ = the weight density\ny\nwhere the negative sign is necessary because we take a positive component of the body\nforce vector to be in a positive coordinate direction.\nBx would be taken as zero.\nWe now consider force and moment equilibrium for this differential element,\nour micro isolation. We sum forces in the x direction which will include the shear\nstress component σyx, acting on the y face in the x direction as well as the normal\nx\n\nChapter 4\nstress component σx acting on the x faces. But note that these components are not\nforces; to figure their contribution to the equilibrium requirement, we must factor\nin the areas upon which they act.\nI present just the results of the limiting process which, we note, since all com\nponents may be functions of both x and y, brings partial derivatives into the pic\nture.\nForces in the x direction →\n∑\nx\n∂\n∂σx\ny\n∂\n∂σyx\nBx\n+\n+\n=\nForces in the y direction →\n∑\nx\n∂\n∂σxy\ny\n∂\n∂σy\nBy\n+\n+\n=\nMoments about the center of the element →\n∑\nσyx\nσxy\n=\nFor example, the change in the stress component ∆σx may be written\n∂σx\n∆σ\n=\n⋅∆x\nx\n∂x\nand the force due to this \"unbalanced\" component in the x direction is\n∂σx ⋅∆x ⋅(∆y∆z)\n∂x\nwhere the product, ∆y ∆z, is just the differential area of the x face.\nThe contribution of the body force (per unit volume) to the sum of force com\nponents in the x direction will be Bx(∆x∆y∆z) where the product of deltas is just\nthe differential volume of the element. We see that this product will be a common\nfactor in all terms entering into the equations of force equilibrium in the x and y\ndirections.\nThe last equation of moment equilibrium shows that, as we forecast, the shear\nstress component on the y face must equal the shear stress component acting on\nthe x face. The differential changes in the shear stress components are of lower\norder and drop out of consideration in the limiting process, as we take ∆x and ∆y\nto zero.\nWe might now try to solve this system of differential equations for σxy,and σy\nand σx but, in fact, we are doomed from the start. Even with the simplification\nafforded by moment equilibrium we are left with two coupled, linear, first-order\n\nChapter 4\npartial differential equations for these three unknowns. The problem is statically\nindeterminate so we are not going to be able to construct a unique solution to the\nequilibrium requirements.\nTo answer these questions we must go beyond the concepts and principles of\nstatic equilibrium. We have to consider the requirements of continuity of displace\nment and compatibility of deformation. This we do in the next chapter, looking\nfirst at simple indeterminate systems, then on to the indeterminate truss, the beam\nin bending and the torsion of shafts.\n\nChapter 4\n4.3\nProblems\n4.1\nA fluid can be defined as a continuum which - unlike a solid body - is\nunable to support a shear stress and remain at rest . The state of stress at any\npoint, within a fluid column for example, we label \"hydrostatic\"; the normal\nstress components are equal to the negative of the static pressure at the point and\nthe shear stress components are all zero. σx = σy = σz = -p and σxy = σxz = σyz =0.\nUsing the two dimensional transformation relations (the existence of σz does\nnot affect their validity) show that the shear stress on any arbitrarily oriented\nplane is zero and the normal stress is again -p.\n4.2\nEstimate the compressive stress at the base of the Washington Monument\n- the one on the Mall in Washington, DC.\n4.3\nThe stress at a point in the plane of a thin plate is shown.

      "content": "Indeterminate Systems\nThe key to resolving our predicament, when faced with a statically indeterminate\nproblem - one in which the equations of static equilibrium do not suffice to deter\nmine a unique solution - lies in opening up our field of view to consider the dis\nplacements of points in the structure and the deformation of its members. This\nintroduces new variables, a new genera of flora and fauna, into our landscape; for\nthe truss structure the species of node displacements and the related species of\nuniaxial member strains must be engaged. For the frame structure made up of\nbeam elements, we must consider the slope of the displacement and the related\ncurvature of the beam at any point along its length. For the shaft in torsion we\nmust consider the rotation of one cross section relative to another.\nDisplacements you already know about from your basic course in physics -\nfrom the section on Kinematics within the chapter on Newtonian Mechanics. Dis\nplacement is a vector quantity, like force, like velocity; it has a magnitude and\ndirection. In Kinematics, it tracks the movement of a physical point from some\nlocation at time t to its location at a subsequent time, say t +δt, where the term δt\nindicates a small time increment. Here, in this text, the displacement vector will,\nmost often, represent the movement of a physical point of a structure from its\nposition in the undeformed state of the structure to its position in its deformed\nstate, from the structure's unloaded configuration to its configuration under load.\nThese displacements will generally be small relative to some nominal length of\nthe structure. Note that previously, in applying the laws of static equilibrium, we\nmade the tacit assumption that displacements were so small we effectively took\nthem as zero; that is, we applied the laws of equilibrium to the undeformed body.1\nThere is nothing inconsistent in what we did there with the tack we take now as\nlong as we restrict our attention to small displacements. That is, our equilibrium\nequations taken with respect to the undeformed configuration remain valid even as\nwe admit that the structure deforms.\nAlthough small in this respect, the small displacement of one point relative to\nthe small displacement of another point in the deformation of a structural member\ncan engender large internal forces and stresses.\nIn a first part of this chapter, we do a series of exercises - some simple, others\nmore complex - but all involving only one or two degrees of freedom; that is, they\nall concern systems whose deformed configuration is defined by but one or two\ndisplacements (and/or rotations). In the final part of this chapter, we consider\n1. The one exception is the introductory exercise where we allowed the two bar linkage to \"snap through\"; in\nthat case we wrote equilibrium with respect to the deformed configuration.\n\nChapter 5\nindeterminate truss structures - systems which may have many degrees of free\ndom. In subsequent chapters we go on to resolve the indeterminacy in our study of\nthe shear stresses within a shaft in torsion and in our study of the normal and shear\nstresses within a beam in bending.\n5.1\nResolving indeterminacy: Some Simple\nSystems.\nIf we admit displacement variables into our field of view, then we must necessar\nily learn how these are related to the forces which produce or are engendered by\nthem. We must know how force relates to displacement. Force-displacement, or\nconstitutive relations, are one of three sets of relations upon which the analysis of\nindeterminate systems is built. The requirements of force and moment equilibrium\nmake up a second set; compatibility of deformation is the third.\nL\nA Word about Constitutive Relations\nYou are familiar with one such constitutive relationship, namely that\nbetween the force and displacement of a spring, usually a linear spring.\nF = k δ\n⋅\nsays that the force F varies linearly with the displacement δ .\nThe spring constant (of proportionality) k has the dimensions of force/\nlength. It's particular units might be pounds/inch, or Newtons/millimeter,\nor kilo-newtons/meter.\nYour vision of a spring is probably that of a coil spring - like the kind you\nmight encounter in a children's playground, supporting a small horse. Or\nyou might picture the heavier springs that might have been part of the\nundercarriage of your grandfather's automobile. These are real-world\nexamples of linear springs.\nBut there are other kinds that don't look like coils at all. A rubber band\nbehaves like a spring; it, however, does not behave linearly once you\nstretch it an appreciable amount. Likewise an aluminum or steel rod when\nstretched behaves like a spring and in this case behaves linearly over a\nuseful range - but you won't see the extension unless you have super\nhuman eyesight.\nFor example, the picture at the left is meant to represent a rod, made of an\naluminum alloy, drawn to full scale. It's length is L = 4 inches , its cross\nA\nsectional area A = 0.01 square inches . If we apply a force, F, to the free\nend as shown, the rod will stretch, the end will move downward just as a\ncoil spring would. And, for small deflections, δ , if we took measurements\nδ\nin the lab, plotted force versus displacement, then measured the slope of\nwhat appears to be a straight line, we would have:\nF\nF = k δ\n⋅\nwhere\nk = 25,000 lb/inch\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nThis says that if we apply a force of 25,000 pounds, we will see an end dis\nplacement of 1.0 inch. You, however, will find that you can not do so.\nThe reason is that if you tried to apply a weight of this magnitude (more than\n10 tons!) the rod would stretch more and more like a soft plastic. It would yield\nand fail. So there are limits to the loads we can apply to materials. That limit is a\ncharacteristic (and conventional) property of the material. For this particular alu\nminum alloy, the rod would fail at an axial stress of\nσyield = 60,000 psi\nor at a force level\nF = 600 pounds factoring in the\narea of 0.01 square inches.\nNote that at this load level, the end displacement, figured from the experimen\ntally established stiffness relation, is δ = 0.024 inches (can you see that?) And\nthus the ratio δ/L is but 0.006. This is what we mean by small displacements. This\nis what we mean by linear behavior (only up to a point - in this case -the yield\nstress). This is the domain within which engineers design their structures (for the\nmost part).\nWe take this as the way force is related to the displacement of individual struc\ntural elements in the exercises that follow2.\nExercise 5.1\nA massive stone block of weight W and uni\nform in cross section over its length L is sup\nported at its ends and at its midpoint by\nthree linear springs. Assuming the block a\nW\nrigid body3, construct expressions for the\nwo = W/L\nforces acting in the springs in terms of the\nweight of the block.\nThe figure shows the block resting on three\nFA\nFB\nFC\nlinear springs. The weight per unit length we\nL/2\nL/2\ndesignate by wo = W/L.\nIn the same figure, we show a free-body diagram.\nThe forces in the spring,\ntaken as compressive, push up on the beam in reaction to the distributed load.\nForce equilibrium in the vertical direction gives:\n2. We will have more to say about constitutive relations of a more general kind in a subsequent chapter.\n3. The word rigid comes to the fore now that we consider the deformations and displacements of extended bod\nies. Rigid means that there is no, absolutely no relative displacement of any two, arbitrarily chosen points in\nthe body when the body is loaded. Of course, this is all relative in another sense. There is always some rela\ntive displacement of points in each, every and all bodies; a rigid body is as much an abstraction as a friction\nless pin. But in many problems, the relative displacements of points of some one body or subsystem may be\nassumed small relative to the relative displacements of another body. In this exercise we are claiming that the\nblock of stone is rigid, the springs are not, i.e., they deform.\n\nChapter 5\nF A + FB + FC - W = 0\nWhile moment equilibrium, summing moments about the left end, A, taking\ncounter-clockwise as positive, gives:\n⋅\nM = FB ⋅ L ⁄ 2 + FC ⋅ L - W\nL\n\n⁄ 2 = 0\n∑\nA\nThe problem is indeterminate: Given the length L and the weight W, we have\nbut two equations for the three unknown forces, the three compressive forces in\nthe springs.\nNow, indeterminacy does not mean we can not find a solution. What it does\nmean is that we can not find a single, unambiguous, unique solution for each of\nthe three forces. That is what indeterminate means. We can find solutions - too\nmany solutions; the problem is that we do not have sufficient information, e.g.,\nenough equations, to fix which of the many solutions that satisfy equilibrium is\nthe right one4.\nIndeterminate solution (to equilibrium alone) #1\nFor example, we might take\nFB = 0 , which in effect says we remove the\nspring support at the middle. Then for equilibrium we must subsequently have\nF A = FC = W ⁄ 2\nThis is a solution to equilibrium.\nIndeterminate solution (to equilibrium alone) #2\nAlternatively, we might require that F A = FC ; in effect adding a third equa\ntion to our system. With this we find from moment equilibrium that\nF A = FC = W ⁄ 3 and so from force equilibrium\nFB = W ⁄ 3\nThis too is a\nsolution.\nIndeterminate solution (to equilibrium alone) #n, n=1,2,......\nWe can fabricate many different solutions in this way, an infinite number. For\nexample, we might arbitrarily take\nFB = W n\n, where n = 1,2,....then from\n⁄\nthe two requirements for equilibrium find the other two spring forces. (Try it)!\nNotice in the above that we have not said one word about the displacements of\nthe rigid block nor a word about the springs, their stiffness, whether they are lin\near springs or non-linear springs. Now we do so. Now we really solve the indeter\nminate problem, setting three or four different scenarios, each defined by a\ndifferent choice for the relative stiffness of the springs. In all cases, we will\nassume the springs are linear.\n4. We say the equations of equilibrium are necessary but not sufficient to produce a solution.\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nFull Indeterminate solution, Scenario #1\nIn this first scenario, at the start, we assume also that they have equal stiff\nness.\nWe set\nF A = k ⋅δA\nFB = k ⋅δB where δA, δB , and δC are the displacements of the springs,\nFC = k ⋅δC\ntaken positive downward since the spring forces were taken positive in compres\nsion5. The spring constants are all equal. These are the required constitutive rela\ntions.\nNow compatibility of deformation: The question is, how are the three displace\nments related. Clearly they must be related; we can not choose them indepen\ndently one from another, e.g., taking the displacements of the end springs as\ndownward and the displacement of the midpoint as upwards. This could only be\nthe case if the block had fractured into pieces. No, this can't be. We insist on com\npatibility of deformation.\nHere we confront the same situation faced by Buridan's ass, that is, the situa\ntion to the left appears no different from the situation to the right so, \"from sym\nmetry\" we claim there is no sufficient reason why the block should tip to the left\nor to the right. It must remain level6.\nIn this case, the displacements are all equal.\nδA = δB = δC\nThis is our compatibility equation.\nSo, in this case, from the constitutive relations, the spring forces are all equal.\nSo, in this case,\nF A = FB = FC = W ⁄ 3\nFull Indeterminate solution, Scenario #2\nIn this second scenario, we assume the two springs at the end have the same\nstiffness, k, while the stiffness of the spring at mid-span is different. We set kB=αk\nso our constitutive relations may be written\nF A = k ⋅δA\nFB = αk ⋅δB\nwhere the non-dimensional parameter α can take on any posi-\nFC = k ⋅δC\ntive value within the range 0 to very, very large.\n5. We must be careful here; a positive force must correspond to a positive displacement.\n6. Note that this would not be the case if the spring constants were chosen so as to destroy the symmetry, e.g., if\nkA > kB > kC .\n\nChapter 5\nNotice again we have symmetry: There is still no reason why the block should\ntip to the left or to the right! So again, the three displacements must be equal.\nδA = δB = δC = δ\nThe constitutive relations then say that the forces in the two springs at the end\nare equal, say = F and that the force in the spring at mid span is αF.\nWith this, force equilibrium gives\nF A + FB + FC = W\ni.e.,\n(2 + α) ⋅\n⋅δ = W\nk\nSo, in this scenario,\nW\nα ⋅W\nF A = FC = ------------------\nand\nFB = -----------------\n(2 + α)\n(2 + α)\n- Note that if we set α=0, in effect removing the middle support, we obtain\nwhat we obtained before - indeterminate solution (to equilibrium) #1.\n- Note that if we set α=1.0, so that all three springs have the same stiffness,\nwe obtain what we obtained before - full indeterminate solution, Sce\nnario #1.\n- Note that if we let α be a very, very large number, then the forces in the\nsprings at the ends become very, very small relative to the force in the\nspring at mid-span. In effect we have removed them. (We leave the stabil\nity of this situation to a later chapter).\nFull Indeterminate solution, Scenario #3\nWe can play around with the relative values of the stiffness of the three springs\nall day if we so choose. While not wanting to spend all day in this way, we should\nat least consider one scenario in which we loose the symmetry, in which case the\nsprings experience different deformations.\nLet us take the stiffness of the spring at the left end equal to the stiffness of the\nspring at midspan, but now set the stiffness of the spring at the right equal to but a\nfraction of the former;\nF A = k ⋅δA\nThat is we take\nFB = k ⋅δB\nFC = αk ⋅δC\nClearly we have lost our symmetry. We need to reconsider compatibility of\ndeformation, considering how the displacements of the three springs must be\nrelated.\n\n---\nIndeterminate Systems\nThe figure at the right is not a free body dia\ngram. It is a new diagram, simpler in many\nrespects than a free body diagram. It is a picture\nof the displaced structure, rather a picture of how\nit might possibly displace.\n\"Possibilities\" are limited by our requirement\nW\nbefore\nL/2\nL/2\nthat the block remain all in one piece and rigid.\nδ\nδA\nB\nδC\nThis means that the points representing the loca\nafter\ntions of the ends of the springs, at their junctions\nwith the block, in the displaced state must all lie\non a straight line.\nThe figure shows the before and after loading states of the system.\nThere is now a rotation of the block as well as a vertical displacement7. Now,\nwe know that it takes only two points to define a straight line. So say we pick δA\nand δB and pass a line through the two points. Then, if we extend the line to the\nlength of the block, the intersection of a vertical line drawn through the end at C\nin the undeflected state and this extended line will define the displacement δC.\nIn fact, from the geometry of this displaced state, chanting \"...similar trian\ngles...\", we can claim\n(δ - δA)\n(δ - δA)\nB\nC\n---------------------- = ----------------------\nor\nδB = -- ⋅(δ + δA)\nC\n(L ⁄ 2)\nL\nThis second equation shows that the midspan displacement is the mean of the two end dis\nplacements.\nThis is our compatibility condition. It holds irrespective of our choice of spring\nstiffness. It is an independent requirement, independent of equilibrium as well. It\nis a consequence of our assumption that the block is rigid.\nNow, with our assumed constitutive relations, we find that the forces in the\nsprings may be written in terms of the displacements as follows.\nF A = k ⋅δA\nFB = k ⋅\n⋅(δ + δA)\nwhere we have eliminated δB from our story.\nC\nFC = αk ⋅δC\nEquilibrium, expressed in terms of the two displacements, δA and δC. gives:\n(δ + δA)\n2k\nδA + -- ⋅(δ + δA) + αδ = W k\nand\n----------------------- + αδC = W ⁄ (\n)\nC\nC\n⁄\nC\n7. We say the system now has two degrees of freedom.\n\nChapter 5\nThe solution to these is:\n2W\nα\nW\n(1 + α)\n2W\nδA = -------- ⋅ ---------------------\nδB = ----- ⋅ ---------------------\nand\nδC = -------- ⋅ --------------------\nk\n(1\n5α)\nk (1\n5α)\nk\n(1\n5α)\n+\n+\n+\n- Note that if we take α =1.0, we again recover the symmetric solu-\ntion\nδA = δB = δC\nand F A = FB = FC = W ⁄ 3\n- Note that if we take α=0 we obtain the interesting result\nδA = 0\nδB = W k\nδC = 2 ⋅ W k which means that the block\n⁄\n⁄\npivots about the left end. And the midspan spring carries all of the weight\nof the block! F A =\n= 0\nFB = W\nFC\n- And if we let α get very, very large...(see the problem at the end of the\nchapter.\nFull Indeterminate solution, Scenario #4\nAs a final variation on this problem, we relinquish our claim that the block is\nrigid. Say it is not made of stone, but of some more flexible, structural material\nsuch as aluminum, or steel, or wood, or even glass. We still assume that the weight\nis uniformly distributed over its length.\nWe will, however, assume the spring stiffness are of a special form in order to\nobtain a relatively simple problem formulation and resolution. We take the end\nsprings as infinitely stiff, as rigid. They deflect not at all. In effect we support the\nblock at its ends by pins. The stiffness of the spring at midspan we take as k.\nOur picture of the geometry of deformation\nmust be redrawn to allow for the relative dis\nplacement of points, any two points, in the\nblock.\nWe again, assuming the block is uniform\nalong its length, can claim symmetry. We\nsketch the deflected shape accordingly.\nEquilibrium remains as before. But now we\nmust be concerned with the constitutive relations for the beam!\nForget the spring for a moment. Picture the\nL/2\nL/2\nW\nδ\nW\n∆W\n∆P\nP\n(a)\nbeam as subjected to two different loadings:\nThe first, a uniformly distributed load, figure\n(a); the second, a concentrated load P at mid-\nspan, as shown in figure (b), due to the pres\nence of the spring.\nLet the deflection at midspan due to first load\ning condition, W, uniformly distributed load,\nbe designated by ∆W. Take it from me that we\ncan write\nW\nkW ⋅∆W\n=\nL/2\nL/2\n(b)\n\n-------------------------\nIndeterminate Systems\nthat is, the deflection grows linearly with the weight8. Here kW is the stiffness, relating the\nmidspan deflection to the total weight of the block.\nLet the deflection at midspan due to the second loading condition, the concen\ntrated load, P, be designated by ∆P. Take it from me that we can write P\nkP ⋅∆P\n=\nwhere we will, in time, identify P as the force due to the compression of the\nspring.\nNow, for compatibility of deformation, the actual deflection at midspan will be\nthe difference of these two deflections: If we take downward as positive we have\nδ = ∆W - ∆P\nwhere δ is the net downward displacement at midspan and hence, the actual compressive\ndisplacement of the spring. Putting this in terms of the spring force and the weight W, and\nthe force P, we have:\nB\n⁄\n⁄\nB\n⁄\n⁄ k = W kW - P kP\nBut P is just FB. So we have\n⁄ k = W kW - FB ⁄ kP\nWe solve this now for the force in the spring in terms of the total weight, W, which we take\nas given and obtain\nkP ⋅ k\nW\nFB = ------------ ⋅ ------------------\nkW\n(k\nkP)\n+\nThis simplifies if you accept the fact that the ratio of the stiffness, kp/kW , is known. Take it\nfrom me that this ratio is 5/8.\nWith this we can write\nFB = 5 8\n⁄\n(\n)\nW\nkP k\n⁄\n+\n(\n) -\n⋅\n3 8\n⁄\nkP k\n⁄\n+\n(\n)\nThen from force equilibrium we obtain:\nF A\nFC\n⋅\n⋅ W\n=\n= -- --------------------------------\n(1 + kP ⁄ k)\n- Note that if we let the stiffness, k, of the spring get very, very large, we get\nF A = FC = (3 ⁄ 16) ⋅ W\nwhile\nFB = (5 8) ⋅ W In effect,\n⁄\nwe have replaced the midspan spring with a rigid, pin support and these\nare the reaction forces at the supports.\nwo = W/L\nFC\nFB=(5/8)W\nFA\n= FA=(3/16)W\n8. We study, and construct expressions for, the displacement distribution of beams due to various loading condi\ntions in a later chapter.\n\nChapter 5\n- Note how, knowing the reaction forces, we could go on and draw the\nshear-force and bending moment diagram.\nThat's enough variations on single problem. We turn now to a second exercise,\nan indeterminate problem again, to see the power of our three principles of analy\nsis.\nExercise 5.2\nA rigid carton, carrying fragile contents (of negligible weight), rests on a\nblock of foam and is restrained by four elastic cords which hold it fast to a\ntruck-bed during transit. Each cord has a spring stiffness kcord = 25 lb/in.;\nthe foam has eight times the spring stiffness, kfoam= 400 lb/in.\nThe gap ∆, in the undeformed\nstate, i.e., when the cords\nhang free, is 1.0 in.9 Show\nthat when the carton is held\ndown by the four cords that\neach of the cords experiences\na tensile force of 20 lb.\nCarton\nFf\nFc\nfoam\nhc\nhf\n∆\nFc\nWe begin by making a cut\nthrough the body to get at the internal forces in the cords and in the foam. We\nimagine the cords hooked to the floor; the system in the deformed state. We cut\nthrough the foam and the cords at some quite arbitrary distance up from the floor.\nOur isolation is shown at the right.\nForce equilibrium gives, noting there are four cords to take into account:\nF f\n4Fc\n-\n=\nHere we model the system as capable of motion in the vertical direction only.\nThe internal reactive force in the foam is taken as uniformly distributed across the\ncut. F is the resultant of this distribution. Consistent with this, the foam, like the\nf\ncords, is taken as a uniaxial truss member, like a linear spring.\nObserve that the foam will compress, the cords will extend. Note that I\nseemingly violate my convention for assumed direction of positive truss member\nforces in that I take a compressive force in the foam as positive. I could argue that\nthis is not a truss; but, no, the real reason for proceeding in this way is to make\nfull use of our physical insight in illustrating the new requirement of compatibility\nof deformation. We can be quite confident that the foam will compress and the\n9. It is not necessary to state that we neglect the weight of the carton if we work from the deformed state with\nthe foam deflected some due to the weight alone. This is ok as long as the relationship between force and\ndeflection is linear which we assume to be the case.\n\nIndeterminate Systems\ncords extend. In other instances to come, the sign of the internal forces will not be\nso clear. Careful attention must then be given to the convention we adopt for the\npositive directions of displacements, as well as forces. Note also that there exists\nno externally applied forces yet internal forces exist and must satisfy equilibrium.\nWe call this kind of system of internal forces self-equilibrating.\nWe see we have but one equation of equilibrium, yet two unknowns, the\ninternal forces F and Ff. The problem is statically, or equilibrium indeterminate.\nc\nWe now call upon the new requirement of Compatibility of deformation to gen\nerate another required relationship. In this we designate the compression of the\nfoam δ ; its units will be inches. We designate the extension of the cords δ ; it too\nf\nc\nwill be measured in inches.\nhc\nhf\nLo\nhc\nLf\n∆\n(hf - δf)\nBefore\nAfter\nCompatibility of deformation is a statement relating these two measures. In\nfact their sum must be, ∆, the original gap. We construct this statement as follows:\nThe original length of the cord is\nLo = h f + hc - ∆ while its final length is\nL f = h f\n(\nδ f\n-\n)\nhc\n+\nThe extension of the cord is the difference of these:\nδc = L f - LO = - δ f + ∆\nCompatibility of Deformation then requires\nδc\nδ f\n+\n∆\n=\nOnly if this is true will our structure remain all together now as it was before fastening\ndown.\nHere is a second equation but look, we have introduced two more unknowns,\nthe compression of the foam and the extension of the cords. It looks like we are\nmaking matters worse! Something more must be added, namely we must relate the\ninternal forces that appear in equilibrium to the deformations that appear in com\npatibility. This is done through two constitutive equations, equations whose form\nand factors depend upon the material out of which the cord and foam are consti\ntuted. In this example we have modeled both the foam and the cords as linear\nsprings. That is we write\n\nc\nChapter 5\nFc\nkc δc\n⋅\n=\nwhere\nkc\n25 lb in\n⁄\n(\n)\n=\nand\nF f\nk f δ f\n⋅\n=\nwhere\nk f\n400 lb in\n⁄\n(\n)\n=\nThese last are two more equations, but no more unknowns. Summing up we\nsee we now have four linearly independent equations for the four unknowns, --\nthe two internal forces and the two measure of deformation.\nThere are various ways to solve this set of equations; I first write δf in terms of\n-\nδ using compatibility, i.e.\n= ∆\nδ\nthen express both unknown forces in\nδ f\nc\nterms of δ .\nc\nF\n= k ⋅δ\nand\nF f = k ⋅(∆\nδ )\n-\nc\nc\nc\nc\nEquilibrium then yields a single equation for the extension of the cords, namely\nk f\n-\nk f ⋅(∆\nδ ) - 4kδ\n= 0 so\nδc = ∆⋅-------------------\nc\nc\n4k + k f\nc\nand we find the tension in the cords, F to be:\nc\nF\n= k ⋅δ\n= 20 lb.\nc\nc\nc\nThe compressive force in the foam is four times this, namely 80 lb, since there\nare four cords. Finally, we find that the extension of the cords and the compres\nsion of the foam are\nδ\n= 0.8 in.\nand\nδ f = 0.2 in.\nc\nwhich sum to the original gap, ∆.\nThis simple exercise10 captures all of the major features of the solution of stat\nically indeterminate problems. We see that we must contend with three require\nments: Static Equilibrium, Compatibility of Deformation, and Constitutive\nRelations. A less fancy phrasing for the latter is Force-Deformation Equations.\nWe turn now to a third exercise which includes truss members under uniaxial\nloading.\n10. Simplicity is not meant to imply that the exercise is not without practical importance or that it is a simple mat\nter to conjure up all the required relationships: If I were to throw in a little dash of the dynamics of a single\ndegree of freedom, Physics I, Differential Equations, mass-spring system I could start designing cord-foam\nsupport systems for the safe transport of fragile equipment over bumpy roads. More to come on this score.\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nExercise 5.3\nI know that the tip deflection at the end C of the structure -- made of a rigid\nbeam ABC of length L= 4m, and two 1020CR steel support struts, DB and\nEB, each of cross sectional area A and intersecting at a= L/4 -- when sup\nporting an individual weighing 800 Newtons is 0.5mm. What if I suspend\nmore individuals of the same weight from the point C; when will the struc\nture collapse?\nL\nL/4\nD\nA\nB\nC\nE\n60o\n45o\nAx\nB\nC\n60o\n45o\nAy\nFE\nFD\nW\nHere is a problem statement which, when you approach the punch line,\nprompts you to suspect the author intends to ask some ridiculous question, e.g.,\n\"What time is it in Chicago?\" No matter. We know that if it's in this textbook it is\ngoing to require a free-body diagram, application of the requirements of static\nequilibrium, and now, compatibility of deformation and constitutive equations. So\nwe proceed. I start with equilibrium, isolating the rigid bar, ABC.\nForce Equilibrium:\nA - FD ⋅ cos 45o - FE ⋅ cos 60o = 0\nx\nAy + FD ⋅ sin 45o - FE ⋅ sin 60o - W = 0\nMoment equilibrium (positive ccw), about point11 A yields\nFD ⋅ sin 45o ⋅(L ⁄ 4) - FE ⋅ sin 60o ⋅(L ⁄ 4) - WL = 0\nThese are three equations for the four unknowns, A , A , F , and F . The struc\nx\ny\nD\nE\nture is redundant. We could remove either the top or the bottom strut and the\nremaining structure would support an end load - not as great an end load but still\nsome significant value.\n11. Member ABC is not a two-force member even though it shows frictionless pins at A, B and C. In fact it is not\na two-force member because it is a three-force member- three forces act at the three pins (FD and FE may be\nthought of as equivalent to a single resultant acting at B). The member must also support an internal bending\nmoment, i.e., over the region BC it acts much like a cantilever beam. Note that, while there can be no couple\nacting at the interface of the frictionless pin and the beam at B, there is a bending moment internal to the\nbeam at a section cut through the beam at this point. If you can read this and read it correctly you are master\ning the language.\n\nChapter 5\nCompatibility of Deformation:\n60o\n45o\n∆Β\n∆Χ\n∆Β\n∼45o\nδD\n∆Β\n∼30o\nδE\nThe deformations of member BD and mem\nber BE are related. How they relate is not\nobvious. We draw a picture, attempting to\nshow the motion of the system from the\nundeformed state (W=0) to the deformed\nstate, then relate the member deformations\nto the displacement of point B.\nI have let ∆B represent the vertical dis\nplacement of point B and ∆C the vertical\ndisplacement at the tip of the rigid beam.\nBecause I have said that member ABC is\nrigid, there is no horizontal displacement\nof point B or at least none that matters. If\nthe member is elastic, the horizontal dis\nplacement should be taken into account in\nrelating the deformations of the two struts. When the member is rigid, there is a\nhorizontal displacement of B but for small vertical displacements, ∆B, the horizon\ntal displacement is second order. For example, if ∆B/L is of order 10-1, then the\nhorizontal displacement is of order 10-2.\nShown above the full structure is an exploded view of the vertical displace\nment ∆B and its relationship to the deformation of member DB, the extension δD.\nFrom this figure I take\nδD = ∆B ⋅ cos 45o = ( 2 2\n⁄ )∆B\nShown at the bottom is an exploded view of the vertical displacement and its\nrelationship to the deformation of member EB. Taking the measures of deforma\ntion as positive in extension, consistent with our convention of taking the member\nforces as positive in tension, and noting that member EB will be in compression,\nwe have\nδE = -∆B ⋅ cos 30o = -( 3 2\n⁄ )∆B\nThese two equations relate the deformations of the two struts through the vari\nable ∆B. We can read them as saying that, for small deflections and rotations, the\nextension or contraction of the member is equal to the projection of the dis\nplacement vector upon the member.\nOnly if these equations are satisfied are these deformations compatible; only\nthen will the two members remain together, joined at point B. This is then our\nrequirement of compatibility of deformation.\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nConstitutive Equations:\nThese are the simplest to write out. We assume the struts are both operating in\nthe elastic region. We have\nσDB = E εDB\n⋅\nor\n\nFD ⁄ A = E δD\n⋅\n⁄ ( 2 ⋅ L 4\n⁄ )\nand\nσEB = E εEB\n⋅\nor\n\nFE A\n⁄\n= E ⋅ δDE\nL\n(⁄\n⁄ 2)\nwhere I have used the geometry to figure the lengths of the two struts.\nNow let's go back and see what was given, what was wanted. We clearly are\ninterested in the forces in the two struts, the two F's; more precisely, we are inter\nested in the stresses engendered by the end load W, for if either of these stresses\nreaches the yield strength for 1020CR steel we leave the elastic region and must\nconsider the possibility of collapse of our structure. These forces, in turn, depend\nupon the member deformations, the δ's which, in turn depend upon the vertical\ndeflection at B, ∆B.\nWe can think of the problem, then, as one in which there are five unknowns.\nWe see that we have seven equations available, but note we have the horizontal\nand vertical components of the reaction force at A as unknowns too, so everything\nis in order. In fact we only need work with five of the seven equations because A\nand A appear only in the two, force equilibrium equations. The wise choice of\ny\npoint A as our reference point for moment equilibrium enables us to proceed with\nout worrying about these two relations 12 I first express the member forces in\nterms of ∆B using the constitutive and compatibility relations. I obtain\nFD = 2 ⋅(AE ⁄ L) ⋅∆B\nand\nFE = - 3 ⋅(AE ⁄ L) ⋅∆B\nwhere the negative sign indicates that member EB is in compression. Note that the magni\ntude of the tensile load in DB is greater than the compression in member EB. Now substi\ntuting these for the forces as they appear in the equation of moment equilibrium I obtain\nthe following relationship between the end load W and the vertical displacement of point\nB, namely:\n2 2\n+\nW = ------------------- ⋅(AE ⁄ L) ⋅∆B\nThis relationship is worth a few words: It relates the vertical force, W, at the\npoint C, at the end of the rigid beam, to the vertical displacement, ∆B,at another\npoint in the structure. The factor of proportionality can be read as a stiffness, k,\nlike that of a linear spring. Note that the dimensions of the factor, (AE/L) are just\nforce per length.\n12. If we were concerned, as perhaps we should be, with the integrity of the fastener at A we would solve these\ntwo equations to determine the reaction force.\nx\n\nChapter 5\nNow I can use this, and the observation that when W= 800N, the tip deflection\nis 0.5mm to obtain an expression for the factor (AE/L). But first I have to relate ∆B\nto the tip deflection ∆C =.5mm. For this I return to my sketch of the deformed\ngeometry and note, if (and only if) ABC is rigid then the two deflections are\nrelated, \"through similar triangles\" by\n∆B = ∆C ⁄ 4\nThis then yields\n8W\n(AE ⁄ L) = ----------------------------------------------- = 8.76 x 106 N m\n⁄\n∆C\n------\n+\n\n⋅(3\n2 2)\n\nNow with the length given as 4 meters and E the elastic modulus, found from a\ntable in Chapter 7, to be 200× 109 N/m , we find that the cross sectional area is\nA = 1.76 x 10 4\n- m = 176 mm2\nIf the struts were solid and circular, this implies a 15 mm diameter.\nThe stress will be bigger in member DB than member EB. In fact, from our\nE\nB\nexpression above for FD, we have σD = 2 ⋅\n⋅(∆⁄ L)\nThis, evaluated for the\nparticular deflection recorded with one individual supported at C and taking E as\nbefore yields σD = 12.6×106 N/m .\nIf we idealize the constitutive behavior as elastic-perfectly plastic and take the\nyield strength as 600×106 N/m , we conclude that we could suspend forty-seven\nindividuals, each a hefty weight of 800 Newtons before the onset of yield in the\nstrut BD, before collapse becomes a possibility.13 But will it collapse at that\npoint? No, not in this idealized world anyway. Member EB has yet to reach its\nyield strength; once it does, then the structure, again in this idealized world, can\nsupport no further increase in end load without infinite deflection and deforma\ntions of the struts.\n13. This is a strange kind of problem - using the observed displacement under a known load to calculate, to\nback-out the cross sectional areas of the struts. The ordinary, politically correct textbook problem would\nspecify the area and everything else you needed (but not a wit more) and ask you to determine the tip dis\nplacement. But nowadays machines are given that kind of straight-forward problem to solve. A more chal\nlenging kind of dialogue in Engineering Mechanics - common to diagnostic situations where your structure\nis not behaving as expected, when something goes wrong, deflects too much, fractures too soon, resonates at\ntoo low a frequency, and the like - demands that you construct different scenarios for the observed behavior,\ne.g., (did it deflect too much because the top strut exceeded the yield strength?), and test their validity. The\nfundamental principles remain the same, the language is the same language, but the context is much richer; it\nplaces greater emphasis upon your ability to formulate the problem, to construct a story that explains the sys-\ntem's behavior. Often, in these situations, you will not have, or be able to obtain, full or complete information\nabout the structure. In this case, backing out the area of the struts might be just one step in diagnosing and\nexplaining the observed and often mystifying, behavior.\n\nIndeterminate Systems\n5.2\nMatrix analysis of Truss Structures\nDisplacement Formulation\nThe problems and exercises we have assigned to date have all been amenable to\nsolution by hand. We now consider a method of analysis especially well suited for\ntruss structures that takes advantage of modern computer power and allows us to\naddress structures with many nodes and members. Our aim is to find all internal\nmember forces and all nodal displacements given some external forces applied at\nthe nodes. In this, we make use of a displacement formulation of the problem; the\nunknowns of the final set of equations we give the computer to solve are the com\nponents of the node displacements. We use matrix notation in our formulation as\nan efficient and concise way to represent the large number of equations that enter\ninto our analysis.\nThese equations will account for i) equilibrium of internal member forces and\nexternal forces applied at the nodes, ii) the force/deformation behavior of each\nmember and iii) compatibility of the extension and contraction of members with\nthe displacements at the nodes. If the structure is statically determinate and we\nseek only to determine the forces in the truss members, we need only consider the\nfirst of these three sets of equations. If, however, we want to go on and determine\nthe displacements of the nodes as well, we then must consider the full set of rela\ntions. If the truss is statically indeterminate, if it has redundant members, then we\nmust always, by necessity, consider the deformations of members and displace\nments of nodes as well as satisfy the equilibrium equations.\nTo illustrate the displacement method we do two examples, one that could be\ndone by hand, the second that is more efficiently done by computer.\nExercise 5.3- The members of the redundant structure shown below have\nthe same cross sectional area and are all made of the same material. Show\nf12\nf13\nf14\nX1\nY1\nφ\nφ\ni\nj\nY1\nX1\nH\nv1 u1\nφ\nφ\nthat the equations expressing force equilibrium of node #1 in the x and y\ndirections, when phrased in terms of the unknown displacements of the\nnode, u1, v1, take the form\n+\n2(AE ⁄ L) ⋅(sin φ ⋅ cos φ2) ⋅ u1 = X1\nand\n(AE ⁄ L) ⋅(1\n2sin φ3) ⋅ v1 = Y 1\n\nChapter 5\nNote: We let X and Y designate the x,y components of the applied force at\nthe node, while u1 and v1 designate the corresponding components of displace\nment of the node.\nEquilibrium. with respect to the undeformed configuration, of node #1\n- f 12 cos φ +\ncos φ + X1 = 0\nand\n- f 12 sin φ-\n- f 14 sin φ + Y 1 = 0\nf 14\nf 13\nThese are two equations in three unknowns as we expected since the structure\nis redundant. In matrix notation they take the form:\nφ\ncos 0\nφ\ncos\n-\nφ\nsin\nφ\nsin\nf 12\nf 13\nf 14\nX1\nY 1\n=\nCompatibility of deformation of the three members is best viewed from the\nfollowing perspective: Imagine an arbitrary displacement of node #1, a vector\nwith two scalar x,y components\nu = u1i + v1 j\nwhere, as usual, i, j are two unit vectors directed along the x,y axes respectively.\nWe take as a measure of the mem\nber deformation, say of member 1-2,\nH\nφ\nδ12\nt12 = cosφ i+ sin φ j\nthe projection of the displacement\nu = u1 i+ v1 j\nupon the member. We must be careful\nto take account if the member extends\n= u - t12\nor contracts. In the second example we\nshow a way to formally do this bit of\naccounting. Here we rely upon a\nsketch. Shown below is member 1-2\nand an arbitrary node displacement u\ndrawn as if both of its components\nwere positive.\nThe projection upon the member is given by the scalar, or dot product\n-\nt12\n= u\nt12\nwhere\n= cos φi + sin φj\nδ12\nis a unit vector directed as shown, along the member in the direction of a positive exten\nsion.\n= u1 cos φ + v1 sin φ\nδ12\nWe obtain\nδ14 = -u1 cos φ + v1 sin φ\nδ13 = v1\nThese three equations relate the three member deformations to the two nodal displace\nments14. If they are satisfied, we can rest assured that our structure remains all of one piece\nin the deformed configuration. In matrix notation, they take the form:\n\n--------\nIndeterminate Systems\nδ12\ncos φ sin φ\n=\nδ13\nu1\nδ14\n- cos φ sin φ v1\nKeeping count, we now have five scalar equations for eight unknowns, the\nthree member forces, the three member deformations, and the two nodal displace\nments. We turn now to the three...\nForce-Deformation relations are the usual for a truss member, namely\nf 12 = (AE ⁄ L12 ) ⋅δ12\nf 13 = (AE ⁄ L13 ) ⋅δ13\nf 14 = (AE ⁄ L14 ) ⋅δ14\nThe lengths may be expressed in terms of H, e.g.,\nL12 = L14 = H ⁄ sin φ\nand\nL13 = H\nThese, in matrix notation, take the form\nAEsin φ\n-------------------\n\nH\n\nf 12\nδ12\nf 13\n=\nAE\nH\nδ13\nδ14\nf 14\nAEsin φ\n-------------------\n\nH\n\nDisplacement Formulation. first expressing the member forces in term of the\nnodal displacements using compatibility and the force-deformation equations, (in\nmatrix notation)\nAEsin φ\n-------------------\n\nH\n\nf 12\ncos φ sin φ u1\nf 13\n=\nAE\n--------\nH\nf 14\nAEsin φ\n- cos φ sin φ v1\n-------------------\n\nH\n\nthen substitute for the forces in the equilibrium equations. We have, again continuing with\nour matrix representation:\n14. Note that the horizontal displacement component, u1, engenders no elongation or contraction of the middle,\nvertical member. This is a consequence of our assumption of small displacements and rotations.\n\n------------------\n-------\n------------------\nChapter 5\nφ\ncos 0\nφ\ncos\n-\nφ\nsin\nφ\nsin\nAE\nφ\nsin\nH -\n\nAE\nH -\n\nAE\nφ\nsin\nH -\n\nφ\ncos\nφ\nsin\nφ\ncos\n-\nφ\nsin\nu1\nv1\n⋅\n⋅\n⋅\nX1\nY 1\n=\nCarrying out the matrix products yields a set of two scalar equations for the two nodal dis\nplacements:\nX1\nAE 2 sin φ(cos φ)\n--------\nu1\n=\nH\n1 + 2 sin3 φ v1\nY 1\nThese are the equilibrium equations in terms of displacements. They can be\neasily solved since they are uncoupled, that is each can be solved independently\nfor one or the other of the nodal displacements. The symmetry of the structure is\nthe reason for this happy outcome. This becomes clear when we write them out\naccording to our more ordinary habit and obtain what we sought to show:\n(AE ⁄ H ) ⋅(2 sin φcos φ2 )u1 = X1\nand\n+\n(AE ⁄ H ) ⋅(1\n\nsin φ3 )v1 = Y 1\nUnfortunately this decoupling doesn't occur often in practice as a second\nexample shows. We turn to that now, a more complex structure, which in a first\ninstance we take as statically determinate.\nL\nL\nu1, X1\nv1, Y1\nu2, X2\nv2, Y2\nu3, X3\nv3, Y3\nα\nα\nNow consider the truss structure shown above. Although this system is more\ncomplex than the previous example in that it has more degrees of freedom - six\nscalar nodal displacements versus two for the simpler truss - the structure is less\ncomplex in that it is statically determinate; there are no redundant or unnecessary\nmembers; remove any member and the structure would collapse.\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nWe first develop a set of equilibrium equations by isolating each of the free\nnodes and requiring the sum of all forces, internal and external, to vanish. In this,\nlower case f will represent member forces, assumed to be positive when the mem\nber is in tension, and upper case X and Y, the x and y components of the externally\napplied forces.\nα\nα\nα\nf\nX1\nY1\nf1\nX2\nf5\nf4\nY2\nY3\nf\nf6\nX3\n3f\nf2\nf2\n- f - f cosα + X = 0\n- f - f cosα + f cosα+ X = 0\n- f + f + X = 0\n- f sinα+ Y = 0\nf sinα + f + f sinα + Y = 0\n- f + Y = 0\nThese six equations for the six unknown member forces can be put into matrix\nform\nf 1\nX1\ncos α 1\n0 0\nY 1\nsin α 0\n0 0\nf 2\n- cos α 0 0 1 cos α 0\nX2\nf 3\n=\n- sin α 0 -\n0 - sin α 0\nf 4\nY 2\n\n-\n0 0\nf 5\nX3\n1 0\nf 6\nY 3\nWe could, if we wish at this point, solve this system of six linear equations for\nthe six unknown member forces f. If you are so inclined you can apply the meth\nods you learned in your mathematics courses about existence of solutions, about\nsolving linear systems of algebraic equations, and verify for yourself that indeed a\nunique solution does exist. And given enough of your spare time, I wager you\ncould actually carry through the algebraic manipulations and obtain the solution.\nBut our purpose is not to burden you with ordinary menial exercise but rather to\nshow you how to formulate the problem for computer solution. We will let it do\nthe menial and mundane work.\nSomething is lost, something is gained when we turn to the machine to help\nsolve our problems. The expressions you would obtain by hand for the internal\nforces would be explicit functions of the applied forces and the parameter α. For\nexample, the second equation alone gives\nf 1 = Y 1 ⁄ (sin α)\n\nChapter 5\nThe computer, on the other hand, would produce, using the kinds of software common in\nindustry, a solution for specific numerical values of the member forces if provided with a\nspecific, numerical value for α and specific numerical values for the externally applied\nforces at the nodes as input. Of course the computer does this very fast, compared to the\ntime it would take you to produce a solution by hand. And, if need be, with the machine\nyou can make many runs and discover how your results vary with α.\nBut note: How the solution changes with changes in the external forces applied\nat the nodes is a simpler matter: since the solutions will be linear functions of the\nX and Y's you can scale your results for one loading condition to get another load\ning condition. That's what linear systems means.\nA small detour:\nThe system is linear because we assumed that the structure experiences only\nsmall displacements and rotations. We wrote our equilibrium equations with\nrespect to the undeformed geometry of the structure. If we thought of the structure\notherwise, say as made of rubber and allowed for large displacements, our free-\nbody diagrams would be incorrect as they stand above. For example, the situation\nat node 3 would appear as at the right rather than as before (at the left)\nY3\nf2\nf\nX\nX3\nf\nα2\nα3\nα6\nY3\nf2\nf3\nf3\n- f + f + X = 0\n- f cosα6(u)+ f2cosα2(u)+ X3= 0\n- f + Y = 0\n- f sinα3(u) - f6sinα6(u)- f sinα2(u)+ Y3= 0\nand our equilibrium equations would now have the more complex form shown.\nIn these, the alpha's will be unknown functions of all the nodal displacements,\nfor example α2 will depend upon the displacement of node 3 relative to node 1.\nWe say that the equilibrium equations depend upon the displacements.\nBut the displacements are functions of the extensions and contractions of the\nmembers. These, in turn, are functions of the forces in the members which means\nthat the equations of equilibrium are no longer linear. The entries in our square\nmatrix, the coefficients of the unknown forces in our system of six equilibrium\nequations, depend upon the member forces themselves.\nFortunately, although we did so in our introductory exercise in Chapter 1, you\nwill not be asked to consider large deformations and rotations. The reason is that\nmost structures do not experience large deflections and rotations. If they do they\nare probably in the process of disintegration and failure. Indeed, eventually we\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nwill entertain a discussion of buckling which ordinarily, though not always, is a\nmode of failure. We leave, then, the study of such complex, but interesting, modes\nof behavior to other scholars. Our detour is complete; we return now to more ordi\nnary behavior.\nOut in the so-called real world, where truss structures span canyons, support\naerospace systems, and have hundreds of nodes and members, complexity requires\nthe use of the computer. Imagine a three-dimensional truss with 100 nodes. Our\nlinear system of equilibrium equations would number 300; we say that the system\nhas 300 degrees of freedom. That is, 300 displacement components are required to\nfully specify the deformed configuration of the structure. But that is not the end of\nit: if the structure includes redundant members and hence is statically indetermi\nnate, other equations which relate the member forces to member deformations and\nstill others relating member deformations to node displacements must be written\ndown and solved together with the equilibrium equations. You could still, theoret\nically, solve all of these hundreds of equations by hand but if you want to remain\nindustrially competitive, if you want to win the bid, you will need the services of\na computer.\nTo illustrate how our system is complicated by adding a redundant member, we\nconnect nodes 3 and 4 with an additional member, number 7 in the figure.\nv3, Y3\nv1, Y1\nL\nL\nu1, X1\nu2, X2\nv2, Y2\nu3, X3\nα\nα\nThe number of linearly independent equilibrium equations remains the same,\nnamely six, but two of the equations, expressing horizontal and vertical equilib\nrium of forces at node 3, now include the additional unknown member force f .\nLeaving to you the task of amending the free-body diagram of node #3, we have\n- f 6 + f 2 - f 7 cos α + X3 = 0\n- f 3 - f 7 sin α + Y 3 = 0\nWith six equations for seven unknowns our problem becomes statically inde\nterminate or equilibrium indeterminate as some would prefer. The difficulty is not\nin finding a solution; indeed, there are an infinity of possible solutions. For exam\nple we could choose the force in member six to be equal to zero and then solve for\n\nChapter 5\nall the other member forces. Or we could choose it to equal X\nand solve, or 10\nlbs, or 2000 newtons, or 2.3 elephants, (just be careful with your units), whatever.\nOnce having arbitrarily specified the force in member six, or the force in any sin\ngle member for that matter, the six equations will yield values for the forces in all\nthe remaining six members. The difficulty is not in finding a solution, it is in find\ning a unique solution. The problem is indeterminate.\nThis unique solution, whatever it is, is going to depend upon the kind of mem\nber we add to the structure as member number seven. It will depend upon the\nmaterial properties and cross-sectional area of this new member; for that matter, it\nwill depend upon the force/deformation behavior of all members. If the first six\nmembers are made of steel and have a cross-sectional area of ten square inches\nand member seven is a rubber band, we would not expect much difference in our\nsolution for the forces in the steel members when compared to our original solu\ntion for those member forces without member seven. If, on the other hand, the\nadded member is also made of steel and has a comparable cross-sectional area, all\nbets are off, or rather on. The effect of the new member will be significant; the\nmember forces will be substantially different when compared to the statically\ndeterminate solution.\nOur strategy for solving the statically indeterminate problem is the same one\nwe followed in the previous exercise: We will express all seven unknown internal\nforces f in terms of the seven, unknown, member deformations which we will des\nignate by δ. We will then develop a method for expressing the member deforma\ntions, the δ's, in terms of the x and y components of nodal displacements u and v.\nThere are six of these latter unknowns. After substitution, we will then obtain our\nsix equilibrium equations in terms of the six unknown displacement components.\nVoila, a displacement formulation.\nEquilibrium\nThe full set of six equilibrium equations in terms of the seven unknown mem\nber forces may be written in matrix form as\nf 1\nX1\ncos α\n0 0\nf 2\nY 1\nsin α\n0 0\nf 3\n- cos α 0 0 1 cos α 0\nf 4\nX2\n=\n- sin α 0 -\n0 - sin α 0\nY 2\nf 5\n\n-\n0 0\n1 cos α\nX3\n1 0\n0 sin α\nf 6\nY 3\nf 7\nor in a condensed form as:\n[\n] f\nX\nA { } = {\n}\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nNote that the array [A] has six rows and seven columns; there are but six equa\ntions for the seven unknown internal forces.\nForce-Deformation\nWe assume that the truss members behave like linear springs and, as before,\ntake the member force generated in deformation of the structure as proportional to\ntheir change in length δ. We introduce the symbol k for the expression (AE/L)\nwhere A is the member cross-sectional area, L its length, and E its modulus of\nelasticity. For example, for member number 1, we take\nf 1 = k1 ⋅δ1\nwhere\nk1 = A1E1 ⁄ L1\nIn matrix form,\nf 1\nk1 0 0 0 0 0 0 δ1\nf 2\n0 k2 0 0 0 0 0 δ2\nf 3\n0 0 k3 0 0 0 0 δ3\nf 4\n=\n0 0 0 k4 0 0 0 δ4\nf 5\n0 0 0 0 k5 0 0 δ5\nf 6\n0 0 0 0 0 k6 0\nδ6\nf 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 k7 δ7\nor again, in condensed form:\nf = k ⋅ δ\nCompatibility of Deformation\nTaking stock at this point we see we have thirteen equations but fourteen\nunknowns; the latter include seven member forces f and seven member deforma\ntions δ. In this our final step, we introduce another six unknowns, namely the x\nand y components of the displacements at the nodes and require that the member\ndeformations be consistent with these displacements. Seven equations, one for\neach member, are required to ensure compatibility of deformation. This will bring\nour totals to twenty equations for twenty unknowns and allow us to claim victory.\n\nChapter 5\nTo relate the δ's to the node displace\nments we consider an arbitrarily oriented\nmember in its undeformed position, then\nin its deformed state, a state defined by\nthe displacements of its two end nodes.\nIn the following derivation, bold face\ntype will indicate a vector quantity.\nConsider a member with end nodes\nnumbered m and n. Let u be the vector\nm\ndisplacement of node m. In terms of its x\nand y scalar components we have:\nu\n= u i + v j\nm\nm\nm\nwhere i and j are unit vectors in the x,y direc\ntions. A similar expression may be written for\nu .\nn\nLet L\nbe a vector which lies along\nthe member, going from m to n, in its\noriginal, undeformed state and L a vector\nalong the member in its displaced,\ndeformed state. Vector addition allows us\nto\nun\num\nn\nm\nLo\nL\ni\nj\nundeformed\ndeformed\nφ\nMember 3\nLo\nL\nu2 =u2i + v2j\nu3 =u3i + v3j\nto = 1j\nto write:\nL + u\n= u\n+ L\no\nn\nm\nNow consider the projection of all of these vector quantities upon a line lying\nalong the member in its original, undeformed state, that is along L . Let t\nbe a\nunit vector in that direction, directed from m to n.\nt\n= cos φi + sin φ j\no\nThe projection of L0 upon itself is just the original length of the member, the\nmagnitude of L0, L0. The projections of the node displacements are given by the\nscalar products t -u and t - u . Similarly the projection of L is t - L which we\nm\nn\ntake as approximately equal to the magnitude of L. This is a crucial step. It is only\nlegitimate if the member experiences small rotations. But note, this is precisely\nthe assumption we made in writing out our equilibrium equations.\nOur vector relationship then yields, after projection upon the direction t of all\nof its constituents\n-\nL\nL ≈u ⋅ t - u ⋅ t\no\nn\no\nm\no\nor since the difference of the two lengths is the member's extension, we have\nδ = u ⋅ t - u ⋅ t\nn\no\nm\no\nFor member 1, for example, carrying out the scalar products we have\nδ3 = v3 - v2\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nNote how the horizontal displacement components, the u components, do not enter into\nthis expression for the extension (or compression if v > v3) of member 3. That is, any dis\nplacement perpendicular to the member does not contribute to its change its length! This is\nclearly only approximately true, only true for small displacements and rotations.\nSimilar equations can be written for each member in turn. In some cases, φ is\nzero, in other cases a right angle. The full set of seven compatibility relationships,\none for each member, can be written in matrix form as:\nδ1\ncos α sin α - cos α - sin α\nu1\nδ2\n\n-\nv1\nδ3\n\n-\nδ4\nu2\n=\nδ5\nδ6\nδ7\ncos α - sin α\nv2\nu3\ncos α sin α v3\nT\nIn condensed form we write\nδ = A\n⋅ u\nwhere [A]T is the transpose of the matrix appearing in the equilibrium equations [A]. The\nconsequence of this seemingly happenstance event will be come clear in the final result.\nEquilibrium in terms of Displacement\nWe now do some substitution to obtain the equilibrium equations in terms of\nthe displacement components at the nodes, all the u's and v's. We first substitute\nfor the member forces f, their representation in terms of the member deformations\nδ and obtain:\nA\nk\nδ\n⋅\n⋅\nX\n=\nNow substituting for the δ column matrix its representation in terms of the\nnode displacements we obtain:\nA\nk\nA\nT\nu\n⋅\n⋅\n⋅\nX\n=\nwhich are the six equilibrium equations with the six displacement components as\nunknowns.\nThe matrix product [A][k][A]T can be carried out in more spare time. We designate the\nresult by [K] and call it the system stiffness matrix. It and all of its elements are shown\nbelow: In this, c is shorthand for cosα and s shorthand for sinα.\nK\nA\n=\nk\nA\nT\n⋅\n⋅\n\nChapter 5\n[K] is symmetric\nsix by six.\nThe equilibrium equations in terms of displacement are, in condensed form\nK\nk1c 2\nk1 )\n+\n(\nk1cs\nk1c\n-\nk1c\n-\ns\nk2\nk1cs\nk\n( 1s 2 )\nk1\n- cs\nk1s 2\n-\nk1c\n-\nk1\n- cs k4\nk\n+ 1c 2\nk\n+ 5c\n\nk1cs k\n- 5cs\n(\n)\nk1c\n-\ns\nk1s 2\n-\nk1cs k\n- 5cs\n(\n)\nk3\nk1\n+\ns 2\nk\n+ 5s\n(\n)\nk\n- 3\nk2\nk2\nk\n+ 6\nk\n+ 7c 2\n(\n)\nk7cs\nk\n- 3\nk7cs\nk3\nk\n+ 7s 2\n(\n)\n=\n(and will always be!) and, for our example is\nK\nu\n⋅\nX\n=\nThis is the set of equations the computer solves given adequate numerical val\nues for\n- the material properties including the Young's modulus or modulus of elas\nticity, E, and the member's cross-sectional area A,\n- member nodes and their coordinates, from which member lengths may be\nfigured, and subsequently together with the material properties, the mem\nber stuffiness, (AE/L), computed,\n- the externally applied forces at the nodes,\n- specification of any fixed degrees of freedom, i.e., which nodes are\npinned.\nThe computer, in effect, inverts the system, or global, stiffness matrix [K], and\ncomputes the node displacements u and v given values for the applied forces X and\nY. Once the displacements have been found, the deformations can be computed\nfrom the compatibility relations. Making use of the force/deformation relations in\nturn, the deformations yield values for the member forces. All then has been\nresolved, the solution is complete.\nBefore ending this section, one final observation. A useful physical interpreta\ntion of the elements of the system stiffness matrix is available: In fact, the ele\nments of any column of the [K] matrix can be read as the external forces that are\nrequired to produce or sustain a special state of deformation, or system of node\ndisplacements - namely a unit displacement corresponding to the chosen column\nand zero displacements in all other degrees of freedom. This interpretation fol\nlows from the rules of matrix multiplication.\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nA Note on Scaling\nIt is useful to consider how the solution for one particular structure of a speci\nfied geometry and subject to a specific loading can be applied to another structure\nof similar geometry and similar loading. By \"similar loading\" we mean a load\nvector which is a scalar multiple of the other. By \"similar geometry\" we mean a\nstructure whose member lengths are a scalar multiple of the corresponding mem\nber lengths of the other - in which case all angles are preserved.\nFor similar loading, relative to some reference solution designated by a super\nscript \"*\", i.e.,\n*\n=\nK ⋅ u *\nX\nwe have, if [X] = β [X*] simply that the displacement vector scales accordingly, that is,\nfrom\n*\nK ⋅ u = X = β ⋅[X ]\nwe obtain [u] = β [u*] .\nThis is a consequence of the linear nature of our system (which, in turn, is a\nconsequence of our assumption of relatively small displacements and rotations).\nWhat it says is that if you have solved the problem for one particular loading, then\nthe solution for an infinity of problems is obtained by scaling your result for the\ndisplacements (and for the member forces as well) by the factor β which can take\non an infinity of values.\nFor similar geometries, we need to do a bit more work. We note first that for\nboth statically determinate and indeterminate systems, the only way length enters\ninto our analysis is through the member stiffness, k, where kj = AE/Lj . (We\nassume for the moment that the cross-sectional areas and the elastic modulae are\nthe same for each member). The entries in the matrix [A], and so [AT] are only\nfunctions of the angles the members make, one with another.\nLet us designate some reference geometry, drawn in accord with some refer\nence length scale, by a superscript \"*\", a reference structure in which the member\nlengths are defined for all members, j= 1,n by\n*\n*\nL j = β j ⋅ L\nThe force-deformation relations\nf =\ncan then be written\nk ⋅δ\n*\nf = (1 ⁄ L ) ⋅ kβ ⋅δ\nwhere the elements of the matrix kβ are given by AE/βj .\nRe-doing our derivation of the equilibrium equations expressed in terms of dis\nplacements yields.\n\nChapter 5\nKβ\nu *\n⋅\nL *\nX\n⋅\n=\nwhere the stiffness matrix K β is given by\nK β\nA\n=\nkβ\nA\nT\n⋅\n⋅\nNote that this is only dependent upon the relative lengths of the members, upon the βj.\nThen if we change length scales, say our reference length becomes L, we have to solve\nK β\nu\n⋅\nL\nX\n⋅\n=\nBut the solution to this is the same, in form, as the solution to the \"*\" problem, differing\nonly by the scale factor L/L*. Hence, solving the reference problem gives us the solution\nfor an infinite number of geometrically similar structures bearing the same loading. (Note\nthat if the loading is scaled down by the same factor by which the geometry is scaled up,\nthe solution does not change!)\n5.3\nEnergy Methods 15\nWe have now all the machinery, concepts and principles, we need to solve any\ntruss problem. The structure can be equilibrium indeterminate or determinate. It\nmatters little. The computer enables the treatment of structures with many degrees\nof freedom, determinate and indeterminate.\nBut before the computer existed, mechanicians solved truss structure prob\nlems. One of the ways they did so was via methods rooted in an alternative per\nspective - one which builds on the notions of work and energy. We develop some\nof these methods in this section but will do so based on the concepts and princi\nples we are already familiar with, without reference to energy.\nThe first method may be used to determine the displacements of a statically\ndeterminate truss structure. Generalization to indeterminate structures will fol\nlow.\n15. The perspective adopted here retains some resemblance to that found in Strang, G., Introduction to Applied\nMathematics, Wellesley-Cambridge Press, Wellesley, MA., 1986. I use \"Energy Methods\" only as a label to\nindicate what this section is meant to replace in other textbooks on Statics and Strength of Materials.\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nL\nu1\nu2\nu3\nv3\nα\nα\nL\nv2\nP\nBefore proceeding, we review\nhow we might determine the\ndisplacements following the\npath taken in developing the\nstiffness matrix. We take as an\nexample the statically determi\nnate example of the last sec\ntion. We simplify the system,\napplying but one load, P in the\nvertical direction at node 1.\nThe system is determinate so\nwe solve for the six member\nforces using the six equations of equilibrium obtained by isolating the structure's\nthree free nodes.\n- f - f cosα = 0\n- f - f cosα + f cosα = 0\n- f + f = 0\n- f sinα + P = 0\nf sinα + f + f sinα = 0\n- f = 0\nThese give:\nf1 = P/ sin α; f2 = - P cos α/ sin α; f3 = 0; f4 = 2P cos α/ sin α;\nf5 = - P/ sin α; and f6 = - Pcos α/ sin α\nwhere a positive quantity means the member is in tension, a negative sign indicates com\npression.\nWith proceed to determine member deformations, [δ], from the force/deforma-\ntion relationships\n[δ] = [ kdiag ]-1 [f]\nthat is, from δ1 = f1/k1, δ2 = f2/k2, ... etc; where the k's are the individual member stiff\nness, e.g.,\nk1 = A1E1/L1 ... etc.\nThen, from the compatibility equation relating the six member deformations to\nthe six displacement components at the nodes,\n[δ] = [ A ]T[u]\nwe solve this system of six equations for the six displacement components u1, v1, u2, v2, u3,\nv3. That's it.\nA Virtual Force Method\nNow consider the alternative method:\nWe start with the compatibility condition:\n[δ] = [A]T[u]\n\nChapter 5\nand take a totally unmotivated step, multiplying both sides of this equation by the trans\npose of a column vector whose elements may be anything whatsoever;\n[f*]T[δ] = [f*]T[A]T[u]\nThis arbitrary vector bears an asterisk to distinguish from the vector of member forces act\ning in the structure.\nAt this point, the elements of [f*] could be any numbers we wish, e.g., the price of coffee\nin the six largest cities of the US (it has to have six elements because the expressions on\nboth sides of the compatibility equation are 6 by 1 matrices). But now we manipulate this\nrelationship, taking the transpose of both sides and write\n[δ]T[f*] = [u]T[A][f*]\nthen consider the vector [f*] to be a vector of member forces, any set of member forces\nthat satisfies the equilibrium requirements for the structure, i.e.,\n[A][f*] = [X*]\nSo [X*] is arbitrary, because [f*] is quite arbitrary - we can envision many dif\nferent vectors of applied loads.\nWith this, our compatibility pre-multiplied by our arbitrary vector, now read as\nmember forces, becomes\n[δ]T[f*] = [u]T [X*]\nor\n[u]T [X*] = [δ]T[f*]\n(Note: The dimensions of the quantity on the left hand side of this last equation\nare displacement times force, or work. The dimensions of the product on the right\nhand side must be the same).\nNow we choose [X*] in a special way; we take it to be a unit load, a virtual\nforce, along a single degree of freedom, all other loads zero. For example, we take\n[X*]T = [ 0 0 0 0 0 1 ]\na unit load in the vertical direction at node 3 in the direction of v3.\nCarrying out the product [u]T [X*] in the equation above, we obtain just the\ndisplacement component associated with the same degree of freedom, v3 i.e.,\nv3 = [δ]T[f*]\nWe can put this last equation in terms of member forces (and member stiffness)\nalone using the force/deformation relationship and write:\nv3 = [f]T[k]-1[f*]\nAnd that is our special method for determining displacements of a statically\ndeterminate truss. It requires, first, solving equilibrium for the \"actual\" member\nforces given the \"actual\" applied loads. We then solve another force equilibrium\nproblem - one in which we apply a unit load at the node we seek to determine a\ndisplacement component and in the direction of that displacement component.\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nWith the \"starred\" member forces determined from equilibrium, we carry out the\nmatrix multiplication of the last equation and there we have it.\nWe emphasize the difference between the two member force vectors appearing\nin this equation; [f] in plain font, is the vector of the actual forces in structure\ngiven the actual applied loads. [f*] with the asterisk, on the other hand, is some,\noriginally arbitrary, force vector which satisfies equilibrium -- an equilibrium\nsolution for member forces corresponding to a unit loading in the vertical direc\ntion at node 3.\nContinuing with our specific example, the virtual member forces correspond\ning to the unit load at node 3 in the vertical direction are, from equilibrium:\nf*1 = 0\nf*2 = 0\nf*3 = 1\nf*4 = cosα/sinα\nf*5 = -1/sinα\nf*6 = 0\nWe these, and our previous solution for the actual member forces, we find\nk\nv3 = (P/k4)(2 cosα/sinα)(cosα/sinα)+ (P/k5)/sin2α\nIf the members all have the same cross sectional area and are made of the same\nmaterial, then the ratio of the member stiffness goes inversely as the lengths so\n5 = cosα k4\nand, while some further simplification is possible, we stop here.\nVirtual Force Method for Redundant Trusses - Maxwell/Mohr Method.\nu1\nu2\nu2\nP\nLet's say we have a redundant structure as\nshown at the left. Now assume we have found\nall the actual forces, f1, f2,....f5, in the members\nby an alternative method yet to be disclosed\n(it immediately follows this preliminary\nremark). The actual loading consists of force\ncomponents X1 and X2 applied at the one free\nnode in directions indicated by u1 and u2.\nNow say we want to determine the horizontal\ncomponent of displacement, u1;\nProceeding\nin accord with our Force Method #1, we must find an equilibrium set of member\nforces given a unit load applied at the free node in the horizontal direction.\n\nChapter 5\nSince the system is redundant, our equilib\nrium equations number 2 but we have 5\nunknowns. The system is indeterminate: it\ndoes not admit of a unique solution. It's not\nthat we can't find a solution; the problem is\nwe can find too many solutions. Now since\nour \"starred\" set of member forces need only\nsatisfy equilibrium, we can arbitrarily set the\nu1\nu2\nα1\nredundant member forces to zero, or, in effect,\nremove them from the structure. The figure at\nthe right shows one possible choice\nFor a unit force in the horizontal direction, we have\n*\nf1 = 1/cosα1 and f3 * = - 1 sinα1 /cosα1\nso the displacement in the horizontal direction, assuming again we have determined the\nactual member forces, is\nu1 = (f1/k1)(1/cosα1) - (f3/k3)(1 sinα1 /cosα1)\n(Note: If the structure is symmetric in member stiffness, k, then this compo\nnent of displacement, for a vertical load alone, should vanish. This then gives a\nrelationship between the two member forces).\nWe now develop an alter-\nP\nnative method to determine\nthe actual member forces in\nstatically indeterminate truss\nstructures.\nConsider,\nfor\nexample,\nthe\nredundant\nstructure shown at the right.\nWe take members 11 and 12\nas redundant and write equi\nlibrium in a way that explic\nitly distinguishes the forces\nin these two redundant mem\nbers from the forces in all the other members. The reasons for this will become\nclear as we move along.\nu7\nv7\nf d\n⋅\n=\nA\nAd\nX\nr\nf r\nIn this, because there are 5 unrestrained nodes, each with two degrees of free\ndom, the column matrix of external forces, [X], is 10 by 1. Because there are two\nredundant members, the column matrix [fr] is 2 by 1. The column matrix of what\nwe take to be \"determinate member forces\" [fd] is 10 by 1, i.e., there are a total of\n\nIndeterminate Systems\n12 member forces. Here, then, are 10 equations for 12 unknowns - an indetermi\nnate system.\nThe matrix [Ad] has 10 rows and 10 columns and contains the coefficients of\nthe 10 [fd]. The matrix [Ar], containing coefficients of the 2 [fr], has 10 rows and 2\ncolumns.\nEquilibrium can then be re-written\n[Ad][fd] + [Ar][fr] = [X]\nor\n[Ad][fd] = - [Ar][fr] + [X]\nbut leave this aside, for now, and turn to compatibility. What we are after is a way to deter\nmine the forces in the redundant members without having to explicitly consider compati\nbility of deformation. Yet of course compatibility must be satisfied, so we turn there now.\nThe relationship between member deformations and nodal displacements can\nalso be written to explicitly distinguish between the deformations of the \"determi\nnant\" members and those of the redundant members, that is, the matrix equation\n[δ] = [A]T[u] can be written:\nd\nr\nδd\nu\n[\n] = [Ad ]T ⋅[ ]\nT\nδ\nAd\n=\n⋅ u\nor\n\nand\nAT\nδ\nr\nδ\nA\nu\n[\n] = [\n]T ⋅[ ]\nr\nr\nThe top equation on the right is the one we will work with. As in force method\n#1, we premultiply by the transpose of a column vector (10 by 1) whose elements\ncan be any numbers we wish. In fact, we multiply by the transpose of a general\nmatrix of dimensions 10 rows and 2 columns - the 2 corresponding to the number\nof redundant member forces. The reasons for this will become clear soon enough.\nWe again indicate the arbitrariness of the elements of this matrix with an asterisk.\nWe write\n[fd*]T [δd] = [fd*]T [Ad]T[u]\nIn this [fd*]T is 2 rows by 10 columns and [δd] is 10 by 1.\nNow take the transpose and obtain\n[δd]T[fd*] = [u]T [Ad][fd*]\nAt this point we choose the matrix [fd*] to be very special; each of the two col\numns of this matrix (of 10 rows) we take to be a solution to equilibrium. The first\ncolumn is the solution when\n- the external forces [X] are all zero and\n- the redundant force in member 11 is taken as a virtual force of unity.\nThe second column is the solution for the determinate member forces when\n- the external forces [X] are all zero and\n- the redundant force in member 12 is taken as a virtual force of unity.\n\nChapter 5\nThat is, from equilibrium,\n[Ad] [fd*] = - [Ar][ I ] where [ I ] is the identity matrix.\nWith this, our compatibility condition becomes\n[δd]T[fd*] = - [u]T [Ar]\nand taking the transpose of this, noting that [δr] =\n[Ar]T[u]\nwe have\n[fd*]T [δd] = - [δr]\nwhich gives us the redundant member deformations, [δr], in terms of the \"determinate\"\nmember deformations, [δd].\nBut we want the member forces too so we now introduce the member force\ndeformations relations which are simple enough, that is\n[δr] = [kr]-1 [fr]\nand\n[δd] = [kd]-1 [fd]\nwhich enables us to write\n[fr] = - [kr][fd*]T [kd]-1 [fd]\nwhich, if given the determinate member forces, allows us to compute the redundant mem\nber forces.\nSubstituting, then, back into the equilibrium equations, we can eliminate the\nredundant forces, expressing the redundant forces in terms of the 10 other member\nforces, and obtain a system of 10 equations for the 10 unknowns [fd], namely\n[ [Ad] - [Ar][kr][fd*]T [kd]-1 ][fd] = [X]\nThere we have it; a way to determine the member forces in a equilibrium inde\nterminate truss structure and we don't have to explicitly consider compatibility.\nWhat we must do is solve equilibrium several times over; two times to obtain the\nelements of the matrix [fd*] in accord with the bulleted conditions stated previ\nously, then, finally, the last equation above, given the applied forces [X].\nTo go on to determine displacements, we can apply force method #1 - apply a\nunit load according to the displacement component we wish to determine; use the\nabove two equations to determine all member forces (with an asterisk to distin\nguish them from the actual member forces); then, with the artificial, equilibrium\nsatisfying, \"starred\" member forces, carry out the required matrix multiplications.\nWe might wonder how we can get away without explicitly considering compat\nibility on our way to determining the member forces in an indeterminate truss\nstructure. That we did include compatibility is clear - that's where we started.\nHow does it disappear, then, from view?\nThe answer is found in one special, mysterious feature of our truss analysis.\nWe have observed, but not proven, that the matrix relating displacements to defor\n\nChapter 5\nmations is the transpose of the matrix relating the applied forces to member\nforces.\nThat is, equilibrium gives\n[A][f] = [X]\nWhile, compatibility gives\n[δ] = [A]T[u]\nNow that is bizarre! A totally unexpected result since equilibrium and compat\nibility are quite independent considerations. (It's the force/deformation relations\nthat tie the quantities of these two domains together). It is this feature which\nenables us to avoid explicitly considering compatibility in solving an indetermi\nnate problem. Where does it come from? How can we be sure these methods will\nwork for other structural systems?\nSymmetry of the Stiffness Matrix - Maxwell Reciprocity\nThe answer lies in that other domain; that of work and energy. In fact, one can\nprove that if the work done is to be path independent (which defines an elastic\nsystem) then this happy circumstance will prevail.\nConsider some quite general truss structure, loaded in the following two ways:\nLet the original, unloaded, state of the system be designated by the subscript \"o\".\nA first method of loading will take the structure to a state \"a\", where the\napplied nodal forces [Xa] engender a set of nodal displacements [ua], then on to\nstate \"c\" where an additional applied set of forces [Xb] engender a set of addi\na\n+\ntional nodal displacements, [ub]. Symbolically:\no →\n→c = a\nb\nand the\nwork done in following this path may be expressed as16\nc\na\nc\nu\nd\n∫\nu\nd\nT\nu\nd\nWorko →c = ∫[\n]\nX T ⋅[\n] =\n[\n]\nX T ⋅[\n] + ∫[\n]\nX\n⋅[\n]\n\no\no\na\nand, in that the second integral can be expressed as\n∫\nc\nc\nb\nb\n[\n]\nX T ⋅[\n] = ∫[Xa + (X\nXa )]T ⋅[\n] = [Xa ] ⋅∫[\n] + ∫[\n]\nX T ⋅[\n]\nu\nd\n-\nu\nd\nT\nu\nd\nu\nd\na\na\no\no\nwe have, for this path from o to c:\nWork o\nc\n→\nX\n[\n]T [\n]\n⋅\no\na\n∫\nX\n[\n]T [\n]\n⋅\no\nb\n∫\nX a\n[\n]T\nu b\n[\n]\n⋅\n+\n+\n=\nu\nd\nu\nd\nA second method of loading will take the structure first to state \"b\", where the\napplied nodal forces [Xb] engender a set of nodal displacements [ub], then on to\nstate \"c\" where an additional applied set of forces [Xa] engender a set of addi\n16. We assume linear behavior as embodied in the stiffness matrix relationship [X] = [K][u].\n\nChapter 5\nb\n+\ntional nodal displacements, [ua]. Symbolically:\no →\n→c = a\nb And follow\ning the same method, we obtain for the work done:\nWorko\nc\n→\nX\n[\n]T [\n]\n⋅\no\na\n∫\nX\n[\n]T [\n]\n⋅\no\nb\n∫\nXb\n[\n]T\nua\n[\n]\n⋅\n+\n+\n=\nu\nd\nu\nd\nComparing the two boxed equations, we see that for the work done to be path\nindependent we must have\nT\nu\n[X ]T ⋅[\n] = [Xb] ⋅[\n]\na\nub\na\nor, with [X] = [K][u]\n[\n]T ⋅[\n] ⋅ub\nub\nK\n[\n]\nu\nK\n[\n] = [\n]T ⋅[\n] ⋅u\na\na\nfrom which we conclude that [K], the stiffness matrix, must be symmetric.\nK\nA\nA\nNow, since, as derived in a previous section, [\n] = [\n] ⋅[kdiag] ⋅[\n]T , we see\nhow this must be if work done is to be path independent.\nA Virtual Displacement Method.\nGiven the successful use of equilibrium conditions alone for, not just member\nforces, but nodal displacements and for indeterminate as well as determinate truss\nstructures, we might ask if we can do something similar using compatibility con\nditions alone. Here life gets a bit more unrealistic in the sense that the initial prob\nlem we pose, drawing on force method #1 as a guide, is not frequently\nencountered in practice. But it is a conceivable problem - a problem of prescribed\ndisplacements. It might help to think of yourself being set down in a foreign cul\nture, a different world, where mechanicians have only reluctantly accepted the\nreality of forces but are well schooled in displacements, velocities and the science\nof anything that moves, however minutely.\nThat is, we consider a truss\nstructure, all of whose displace\nment\ncomponents\nare\npre\nscribed, and we are asked to\ndetermine the external forces\nrequired to give this system of\ndisplacements. In the figure at\nthe right, the vectors shown are\nmeant to be the known pre\nscribed displacements. (Node\n#1 has zero displacement). The\ntask is to find the external forces, e.g., X3, Y3, which will produce this deformed\nX3\nY3\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nstate and be in equilibrium - and we want to do this without considering equilib\nrium explicitly!\nWe start with equilibrium17:\n[X] = [A] [f]\nand take a totally unmotivated step, multiplying both sides of this equation by the trans\npose of a column vector whose elements may be anything whatsoever;\n[u*]T[X] =[u*]T[A] [f]\nThis arbitrary vector bears an asterisk to distinguish it from the vector of actual displace\nment prescribed at the nodes.\nAt this point, the elements of [u] could be any numbers we wish, e.g., the price of coffee in\nthe 12 largest cities of the US (it has to have twelve elements because the expressions on\nboth sides of the equilibrium equation are 12 by 1 matrices). But now we manipulate this\nrelationship, taking the transpose of both sides and write\n[X]T[u*] = [f]T[A]T[u*]\nthen consider the vector [u*] to be a vector of nodal displacements, any set of nodal dis\nplacements that satisfies the compatibility requirements for the structure, i.e.,\n[A]T[u*] = [δ*]\nSo [δ*] is still arbitrary, because [u*] is quite arbitrary - we can envision many\ndifferent sets of member deformations.\nWith this, our equilibrium equations, pre-multiplied by our arbitrary vector\nbecomes\n[X]T[u*] = [f]T[δ*]\nor\n[u*]T [X] =[δ*]T[f]\n(Note: The dimensions of the quantity on the left hand side of this last equation\nare displacement times force, or work. The dimensions of the product on the right\nhand side must be the same).\nNow we choose [u*] in a special way; we take it to represent a unit, virtual dis\nplacement associated with a single degree of freedom, all other displacements\nzero. For example, we take\n[u*]T = [ 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0......]\na unit displacement in the vertical direction at node 3 in the direction of Y3.\nCarrying out the product [u*]T [X] in the equation above, we obtain just the\nexternal force component associated with the same degree of freedom, Y3 i.e.,\nY3 = [δ*]T[f]\n17. We allow the system to be indeterminate as indicated in the figure.\n\nChapter 5\nWe can cast this last equation into terms of member deformations (and member\nstiffness) and write:\nY3 = [δ*]T [kdiag][δ]\nAnd that is our special method for determining external forces of a statically\ndeterminate (or indeterminate) truss when all displacements are prescribed. It\nrequires, first, solving compatibility for the \"actual\" member deformations [δ]\ngiven the \"actual\" prescribed displacements. We then solve another compatibility\nproblem - one in which we apply a unit, or \"dummy\" displacement at the node we\nseek a to determine an applied force component and in the direction of that force\ncomponent. With the \"dummy\" member deformations determined from compati\nbility, we carry out the matrix multiplication of the last equation and there we\nhave it.\nWe emphasize the difference between the two deformation vectors appearing in\nthis equation; [δ] in plain font, is the vector of actual member deformations in the\nstructure given the actual prescribed nodal displacements. [δ*] starred, on the\nother hand, is some, originally arbitrary virtual deformation vector which satisfies\ncompatibility - compatibility solution for member deformations corresponding to\na unit displacement in the vertical direction at node 3.\nWe emphasize that our method does not require that we explicitly write out and\nsolve the equilibrium equations for the system. We must, instead, compute com\npatible member deformations several times over.\nA Generalization\nWe think of applying Displacement Method #1 at each degree of freedom in\nturn, and summarize all the relationships obtained for the required applied forces\nin one matrix equation. We do this by choosing\n0 ..... 0\n1 ..... 0\nT\n*\n=\n=\nu\n..... ..... ..... ..... .....\nI\n12 x 12\n0 ..... 1\n0 ..... 0\nwhere each row represents a unit displacement in the direction of the \"rowth\" degree of\nfreedom.\nThe corresponding member deformations [δ*] now takes the form of a 11 x 12\nmatrix whose \"jth\"column entries are the deformations engendered by the unit dis\nplacement of the \"ith\" row above. (Note there are 11 members, hence 11 deforma\ntions and member forces).\nWe still have\n[u*]T [X] =[δ*]T[f]\nwhere\n[δ*]T = [u*]T [A]\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nbut now [u*]T is a 12 by 12 matrix, in fact the identity matrix. So we can write:\n[X] =[δ*]T[f]\n- an expression for all the required applied forces, noting that the matrix [δ*]T is 12 by 11.\nSome further manipulation takes us back to the matrix displacement analysis\nresults of the last section.

The bridge, currently four lanes, is a major link in\nRoute 2 which carries traffic in and out of Boston from the west.

In fact, the MDC, the Metropolitan District Commission, has a\nstrong voice in the reconstruction project and they very much would like to stress\nthe parkway dimension of the project. In this they must work with the DPW, the\nDepartment of Public Works. The DPW is the agency that must negotiate with the\nFederal Government for funds to help carry through the project.

Following a presentation by a Met\nropolitan District Commission planner on the Alewife Development proposal\nTuesday night, the Belmont Conservation Commission expressed frustration over\nan approval process that appears to railroad a project of questionable benefit and\nuncertain impact, regardless of communities' concerns and requests. The Alewife\nproject would widen Route 2 and redesign the truss bridge, access roads and\naccess ramps on Route 2 near the Belmont-Arlington-Cambridge border. It also\nwould extend Belmont's Brook Parkway significantly. Alewife Basin planner John\nKrajovick told the commission that MDC has grave concerns about the proposed\ntransportation project and that, funding issues aside, it might be impossible to pre\nvent the Massachusetts Department of Public Works' \"preferred alternative\" from\nbeing implemented. According to Krajovick, the MDC's concerns center around\nthe loss of open space that will accompany the project, specifically the land along\nthe eastern bank of Yates pond, the strip abutting the existing parkway between\nConcord Avenue and Route 2, the wetlands along the railroad right-of-way near\nthe existing interim access road, and that surrounding the Jerry's pool site. \"Our\ngoal is to reclaim parkways to the original concept of them,\" said Krajovick. \"It\nwas Charles Elliot's vision to create a metropolitan park system - a kind of\nmuseum of unique open spaces...and use the parkways to connect them as linear\nparks.\" \"The world has changed. They are no longer for pleasure vehicles only,\nbut parkways, we feel, are a really important way to help to control growth and\nmaintain neighborhood standards,\" he added. \"We would like to see the character\nof this more similar to Memorial Drive and Storrow Drive as opposed to an\nexpressway like Route 2.\" Krajovick outlined the MDC's further concerns with\nthe project, citing its likely visual, physical, noise, and environmental impacts on\nsurrounding neighborhoods. Projected to cost $60-$70 million, he said, the \"pre\nferred alternative\" will also hurt a sensitive wetland area, the Alewife Reserva\ntion, in return for minimal traffic improvements. In spite of these concerns,\nKrajovick reported that the project is nearing a stage at which it becomes very dif\nficult to prevent implementation. The Final Environmental impact Statement is\nexpected to be submitted to the Federal Highway Department within a month. The\nsame document will be used as the final report the state's Executive Office of\nEnvironmental Affairs. EOEA Secretary John DeVillars cannot stop the project\nonce he receives that report. He can call for mitigating measures only. Krajovick\nnoted a bill currently before the state Legislature's Transportation Committee\ncould prohibit the project from going forward as presently designed. He took no\nposition on that bill. Conservation Commission members, however, voiced doubts\n18. Reprinted with permission of Harte-Hanks Community Newspapers, Waltham, MA\n\nChapter 5\non the likelihood a passage in the face of the fiscal crisis and state elections that\nloom before legislators. In addition, Krajovick said that state budget cuts are\nexpected to result in layoffs for nearly 600 of the MDC's staff of 1,000 workers,\neffectively decimating the agency. \"Our hopes for a compromise solution may not\nhappen,\" he said. Discouraged by Krajovick's dismal prognosis, Conservation\nCommission members expressed concern that there was nothing they could do to\nchange the course of the project. The commission has been providing input on the\nproject for 12 years with no results. In response to Krajovick's presentation, Com\nmission member William Pisano called the need for updated impact studies, say\ning, \"We agree with you. What we want to see is a lot more data and a more\naccurate realization of what we're playing ball with today.\" Commending the way\nin which concerned residents of Arlington, Cambridge and Belmont have gotten\ninvolved in the project, however, Krajovick said their thinking as a neighborhood\nrather than individual towns is a positive thing that has come from the project.\nBuilding on that team spirit, he said, the communities can raise their voice\nthrough formation of a Friends group and work toward the development of a mas\nter plan or restoration plan for the whole Alewife reservation area.\nBRIDGE MEETING HIGHLIGHTS ISSUES\nBelmont Citizen-Herald September 26, 1991 by Alin Kocharians, Citizen-\nHerald staff\nSome 50 residents turnout out Tuesday night at Winn Brook School to hear a\npresentation by the state Metropolitan District Commission on the Alewife Brook\nParkway Truss Bridge. MDC representatives previewed their Truss Bridge renova\ntion and Parkway restoration plans. The Parkway segment affected is in Cam\nbridge, between the Concord Avenue rotary and Rindge Avenue. Plans for the\ntwo-year project, MDC officials hope, will be completed by early 1992, with con\nstruction following in the spring of that year. Julia O'Brien, MDC's director of\nplanning, said that the $12 million necessary for the project will be provided by\nthe Legislature and federal grants. Once the bridge renovation is completed, the\ntruck ban on it will be lifted, hopefully reducing truck traffic in Belmont. The ren\novation plans are 75 percent complete, according to John Krajovic, the MDC plan\nner in charge of the project. The MDC is also visiting with Arlington and\nCambridge residents, asking for input on the project's non-technical aspects. Res\nidents and MDC representatives exchanged compliments in the first hour, but as\nthe meeting wore on, the topics of cosmetic versus practical and local versus\nregional issues proved divisive. One Belmont resident summed up what appeared\nto be a common misgiving in town. \"I don't want to cast stones, because it is a\nnice plan,\" said John Beaty of Pleasant Street, \"but it doesn't solve the overall\nproblem. I wish that I were seeing not just MDC here. There were two competing\nplans. It is the (State Department of Public Works') charter to solve the overall\nregion's problem. I see those two as being in conflict.\" Beaty said that the DPW\nplan was presented two years ago to residents, when officials had said that the\nplan was 60 percent complete. Stanley Zdonik of Arlington agreed. \"I am\nimpressed with the MDC presentation, but what bothers me is, are you going to\n\nIndeterminate Systems\nimprove on the traffic flow?\" he said. \"You have got one bottleneck at one end,\nand another at the other.\" He said that the Concord Avenue and Route 2 rotaries at\neither end of the bridge should have traffic signals added, or be removed alto\ngether. Krajovic replied that according to what the MDC's traffic engineer had\ntold him, \"historically, signalizing small rotaries actually backs up traffic even\nmore.\" Belmont Traffic Advisory Committee member Marilyn Adams took issue\nwith the decision not to add signals to the rotaries, and asked to see the study that\nproduced this recommendation. Adams was also concerned with a \"spill off\" of\ntraffic from the construction. \"I can't guarantee people won't seek out other\nroutes,\" including Belmont, O'Brien said. However, she added, she did not expect\nthe impact to be very great, as the Parkway would still be open during construc\ntion. \"We will make really a strong effort for a traffic mitigation\" plan to be nego\ntiated with the town, she said. Selectman Anne Paulsen also asked about the\nimpact of traffic on the town. MDC representatives said that various traffic sur\nveys were being conducted to find a way to relieve the traffic load on Belmont.\nKrajovic said that traffic problems in Belmont were regional questions, to be han\ndled by local town officials, a point with which Paulsen disagreed. Paulsen said\nthat she would prefer a more comprehensive plan for the region. Aside from the\nreconstruction of the Truss Bridge, she said, \"I think the point of the people of\nBelmont is that...we want improvement in the roadway, so that we are relieved of\nsome of the traffic.\" According to the plans, the new bridge will have four 11-foot\nlanes, one foot wider than the current width for each lane. There will also be a\nbroader sidewalk, and many new trees planted both along the road and at the rota\nries. There will be pedestrian passes over the road, and a median strip with green\nery. The bridge will be made flat, so that motorists will have better visibility,\nengineering consultant Ray Oro said. It will be constructed in portions, so that two\nlanes will always be able to carry traffic, he said. According to Blair Hines of the\nlandscaping firm of Halvorson Company, Inc., by the end of the project, \"Alewife\nBrook Parkways will end up looking like Memorial Drive.\" All the talk about\nlandscaping, Paulsen suggested with irony, \"certainly calms the crowd.\"\n\nChapter 5\n5.4\nProblems\n5.1\nIf the springs are all of equal stiffness, k, the bar ABC rigid, and a couple\nMo is applied to the system, show that the forces in the springs are\nFA = -(5/7)Mo/H\nFB=(1/7)Mo/H\nFC=(4/7)Mo/H\nH\nH/2\nA\nB\nC\nMo\n5.2\nThe problem show within the box was worked incorrectly by an MIT\nstudent on an exam.

      "content": "Strain\nThe study of the elastic behavior of statically determinate or indeterminate truss\nstructures serves as a paradigm for the modeling and analysis of all structures in\nso far as it illustrates\n- the isolation of a region of the structure prerequisite to imagining internal\nforces;\n- the application of the equilibrium requirements relating the internal\nforces to one another and to the applied forces;\n- the need to consider the displacements and deformations if the structure\nis redundant; 1\n- and how, if displacements and deformations are introduced, then the con\nstitution of the material(s) out of which the structure is made must be\nknown so that the internal forces can be related to the deformations.\nWe are going to move on, with these items in mind, to study the elastic behav\nior of shafts in torsion and of beams in bending with the aim of completing the\ntask we started in an earlier chapter - among other objectives, to determine when\nthey might fail. To prepare for this, we step back and dig in a bit deeper to develop\nmore complete measures of deformation, ones that are capable of taking us\nbeyond uniaxial extension or contraction. We then must relate these measures of\ndeformation, the components of strain at a point to the components of stress at a\npoint through some stress-strain equations. We address that task in the next chap\nter.\nWe will proceed without reference to truss members, beams, shafts in torsion,\nshells, membranes or whatever structural element might come to mind. We con\nsider an arbitrarily shaped body, a continuous solid body, a solid continuum. We\nput on another special pair of eyeglasses, a pair that enables us to imagine what\ntranspires at a point in a solid subjected to a load which causes it to deform and\nengenders strain along with some internal forces - the stresses of chapter 4. In our\nderivations that follow, we limit our attention to two dimensions: We first con\nstruct a set of strain measures in terms of the x,y (and z) components of displace\nment at a point. We then develop a set of stress/strain equations for a linear,\nisotropic, homogenous, elastic solid.\n1. We of course must consider the deformations even of a determinate structure if we wish to estimate the dis\nplacements of points in the structure when loaded.\n\nChapter 6\n6.1\nStrain: The Creature and its Components.\nWhen a body displaces as a rigid body, points etched on the body will move\nthrough space but any arbitrarily chosen point will maintain the same distance\nfrom any other point-just as the stars in the sky maintain their position relative to\nother all other stars, night after night, as the heavens rotate about the earth Except,\nof course, for certain \"wandering stars\" which do not maintain fixed distances among\nthemselves or from the others.\nBut when a body deforms, points move\nrelative to one another and distances between\npoints change. For example, when the bar\nshown below is pulled with an end load P\nalong its axis we know that a point at the end\nwill displace to the right, say a distance uL,\nrelative to a point at the fixed, left end of the\nP\nL\nL\nuL\nP\nbar.\nAssuming the bar is homogenous, that is,\nits constitution does not change as we move\nin from the end of the bar, we anticipate that\nthe displacement relative to the fixed end will decrease. At the wall it must be\nzero; at the mid point we might anticipate it will be uL/2. Indeed, this was the\nessence of our story about the behavior of an elastic rod in a uniaxial tension test.\nThere we had\nP = ( AE\n\n⁄ L)\n\nδ\n\n⋅\n= k δ\n⋅\nThe stiffness k is inversely proportional to the length of the rod so that, if the\nsame end load is applied to bars of different length, the displacement of the ends\nwill be proportional to their lengths, and the ratio of δ to L will be constant.\nIn our mind, then, we can imagine the horizontal rod shown above cut through\nat its midpoint. As far as the remaining, left portion is concerned, it is fixed at its\nleft end and sees an a load P at its right end. Now since it has but half the length,\nits end will displace to the right but uL/2.\nWe can continue this thought experiment from now to eternity; each time we\nmake a cut we will obtain a midpoint displacement which is one-half the displace\nment at the right end of the previously imagined section. This of course assumes\nthe bar is uniform in its cross-sectional area and material properties --that is, the\nbar is homogeneous. We summarize this result neatly by writing\nu x\n( ) = ( uL ⁄ L) ⋅ x\nwhere the factor, (uL/L), is a measure of the extensional strain of the bar, defined as the\nratio of the change in length of the bar to its original length.\nThis brief thought experiment gives us a way to define a measure of exten\nsional strain at a point. We say, at any point in the bar, that is, at any x,\nε = lim (∆ u ⁄ ∆ x) ⇒ε = ∂ u\nx\n∆ x → 0\nx\n∂ x\n\nChapter 6\nFor the homogenous bar under end load P we see that ε is a constant; it does\nx\nnot vary with x. We might claim that the end displacement, uL is uniformly dis\ntributed over the length; that is, the relative displacement of any two points, equi\ndistant apart in the undeformed state, is a constant; but this is not the usual way of\nspeaking nor, other than for a truss element, is it usually the case.\nThe partial derivative implies that, u, the displacement component in the x\ndirection, can be a function of spatial dimensions other than x alone; that is, for an\narbitrary solid, with things changing as one moves in any of the three coordinate\ndirections, we would have u= u(x,y,z). We turn to this more general situation now.\nExercise 6.1\nWhat do I need to know about the displacements of points in a solid in order\nto compute the extensional strain at the point P, arbitrarily taken, in the\ndirection of to, also arbitrarily chosen, as the body deforms from the state\nindicated at the left to that at the right?\ny\nz\nx\nφ\nQ\nP\nAfter Deformation\nφ\nQ'\nP'\nto\nQ\nP\nP\nQ\nBefore Deformation\nWe designate the extensional strain at P in the direction of t0 by εPQ. Our task\nis to see what we need to know in order to evaluate the limit\nεPQ = lim (P'Q' - PQ) ⁄ (PQ)\nPQ → 0\nTo do this, we draw another picture of the\nt\nundeformed and deformed differential line ele-\nQ'\nment, PQ. together with the displacements of\nits endpoints. Point P's displacement to P' is\nAfter\ny\nφ\nP\nP'\nQ\nu + ∆u\nLo\nL\nBefore\nto\nshown as the vector, u, while the displacement of\npoint Q, some small distance away, is designated by\nu+∆u.\nThis now looks very much like the representa\nu\ntion used in the last chapter to illustrate and\nconstruct an expression for the extension of a\ntruss member as a function of the horizontal\nx\nand vertical components of displacement at its\ntwo ends. That's why I have introduced the\nvectors L , and L for the directed line segments PQ, P'Q' respectively though\no\n\nChapter 6\nthey are in fact meant to be small, differential lengths. Proceeding in the same\nway as we did in our study of the truss, we write, as a consequence of vector addi\ntion,\n+\n+\nu\nL = u + ∆u\nL0\nwhich yields an expression for ∆ u in terms of the vector difference of the two directed\nline segments, namely\n∆u = L - L0\nWe now introduce a most significant constraint, We assume, as we did with the\ntruss, that displacements and rotations are small - displacements relative to some\ncharacteristic length of the solid, rotations relative to a radian. This should not to\nbe read as implying our analysis is of limited use. Most structures behave, i.e.,\ndeform, according to this constraint and, as we have seen in our study of a truss\nstructure, it is entirely consistent with our writing the equilibrium equations with\nrespect to the undeformed configuration. In fact not to do so would be erroneous.\nExplicitly this means we will take\nt\nt\n≈ 0\nso that\nL = t - L ≈t0 - L\nWith this we can claim that the change in length of the directed line segment,\nPQ, in moving to P'Q', is given by the projection of ∆u upon PQ that is, since\nP'Q' - PQ = L - L0\nwe have\n-\nP'Q' - PQ = t0 - L - t0 - L0 = t0 - (L\nL0) = t0 - ∆u\nwhere to is, as before, a unit vector in the direction of PQ.\nt = cos φ ⋅ i + sin φ ⋅ j\no\nFrom here on in, constructing an expression for εPQ requires the machine-like\nevaluation of the scalar product, t0 * ∆u, the introduction of the partial derivatives\nof the scalar components of the displacement taken with respect to position, and\nthe manipulation of all of this into a form which reveals what's needed in order to\ncompute the relative change in length of the arbitrarily oriented, differential line\nsegment, PQ. We work with respect to a rectangular cartesian coordinate frame,\nx,y, and define the horizontal and vertical components of the displacement vector\nu to be u,v respectively2. That is, we set\n(\n(\nu = u x, y) ⋅ i + v x, y)j\nwhere the coordinates x,y label the position of the point P. The differential change in the\ndisplacement vector in moving from P to Q, a small distance which in the limit will go to\nzero, may then be written\n2. In the following be careful to distinguish between the scalar u and the vector u; the former is the x compo\nnent of the latter.\n\nChapter 6\n(\n(\n∆u = ∆u x, y) ⋅i + ∆v x, y) ⋅j\nCarrying out the scalar product, we obtain for the change in length of PQ:\nP'Q' - PQ = t0 - ∆u = (∆u) ⋅cos φ + (∆v) ⋅sin φ\nWe next approximate the small changes in the horizontal and vertical, scalar\ncomponents of displacement by the products of their slopes at P taken with the\nappropriate differential lengths along the x and y axes as we move to point Q. That\n∂u\n∂u\n∂v\n∂v\nis3\n∆u x, y) ≈\n∆x +\n∆y\nand\n∆v x, y) ≈\n∆x +\n∆y\n(\n\n(\n\n∂x\n∂y\n∂x\n∂y\nWe have then\n∂u\n∂u\n∂v\n∂v\n(P'Q' - PQ) ⁄ (PQ) ≈\n∆x +\n∆y (cos φ ⁄ L ) +\n∆x +\n∆y (sin φ ⁄ L )\no\no\n\n∂x\n∂y\n∂x\n∂y\nwhere I have introduced L for the original length PQ.\no\nThis is an approximate relationship because the changes in the horizontal and\nvertical components of displacement are only approximately represented by the\nfirst partial derivatives. In the limit, however, as the distance PQ, and hence as ∆x,\n∆y approaches zero, the approximation may be made as accurate as we like. Note\nalso, that the ratios ∆x/L , ∆y/L approach cosφ and sinφ respectively.\no\no\nWe obtain, finally, letting PQ go to zero, the following expression for the\nextensional strain at the point P in the direction PQ:\n∂u\n∂v\nsin\nεPQ =\ncos2 φ + ∂u\n∂vcos φ\nφ\n\n+\nsin2 φ\n\n∂y + ∂x\n\n∂x\n∂y\nIt appears that in order to compute εPQ in the direction φ we need to know the\nfour first partial derivatives of the scalar components of the displacement at the\npoint P. In fact, however, we do not need to know all four partial derivatives since\nit is enough to know the three bracketed terms appearing above Think of comput\ning εPQ for different values of φ; knowing the values for the three bracketed terms\nwill enable you to do this.\nThe relationship above is a very important piece of machinery. It tells us how\nto compute the extensional strain in any direction, defined by φ, at any point,\ndefined by x,y, in a body. In what follows, we call the three quantities within the\nbrackets the three scalar components of strain at a point. But first observe:\n- If we set φ equal to zero in the above, which is equivalent to setting PQ\nout along the x axis, we obtain, as we would expect, that εPQ = ε , the\nx\nextensional strain at P in the x direction, i.e.,\n∂u\nε\n=\n\nx\n\n∂x\n3. It is easy to be confused in the midst of all these partial derivatives. It's worth taking five minutes to try to sort\nthem out.\n\nChapter 6\n- Our machinery is thus consistent with our previous definition of ε for\nx\nuniaxial loading of a bar fixed at one end and lying along the x axis.\n- If, in the same way, we set φ equal to a right angle, we obtain\n∂v\n\n=\nεPQ\n\n∂y\nwhich can be read as the extensional strain at P in the direction of a line seg\nment along the y axis. We call this ε . That is\ny\n∂v\nε\n=\n\ny\n\n∂y\n∂u\n∂v\n- The meaning of the term ∂y + ∂x is best extracted from a sketch; below\nwe show how the term ∂v can be interpreted as the angle of rotation,\n∂x\nabout the z axis, of a line segment PQ along the x axis. For small rotations\nwe can claim\n∂v\n\n∆x\n\n∂x\nα ∼tan α = ------------------\n∆x\nSimilarly, the term δ u/δ y can\nQ'\nbe interpreted as the angle of rota\ntion of a line segment along the y\n(δv/δx)∆x\naxis, but now, if positive, about α = (δv/δx)\n∆u\ny\nthe negative z axis. The figure\nx\nbelow shows the meaning of both\nP\n∆x\nQ\n(δu/δx)∆x\nterms.\nR'\nThe sum of the two terms is the change in\ny\nthe right angle, PQR at point P. If it is a pos-\nR\nitive quantity, the right angle of the first\nx\nQ'\nquadrant has decreased. We define this sum\n(δu/δy)\nto be a shear strain component at point P\n(δv/δx)\nand label it with the symbol γ .\nP,P'\n∆x Q\nxy\n- Building on the last figure, we define a rotation at the point P as the aver\nage of the rotations of the two, x,y, line segments. That is we define\nωxy\n1 2\n⁄\n(\n)\nx\n∂\n∂v\n\ny\n∂\n∂u\n\n-\n=\nNote the negative sign to account for the different directions of the two line segment rota\ntions. If, for example, δ v/δ x is positive, and δ u/δ y = - δ v/δ x then there is no shear\nstrain, no change in the right angle, but there is a rotation, of magnitude δ v/δ x positive\n\nChapter 6\nabout the z axis at the point P. These three quantities ε ,γ ,ε are the three components of\nstrain at a point.\nx\nxy y\nεx\nx\n∂\n∂u\nγ xy\nx\n∂\n∂v\n\ny\n∂\n∂u\n\nεy\ny\n∂\n∂v\n≡\n+\n≡\n≡\nIf we know the way ε (x,y), γ\n(x,y), and ε (x,y) vary, we say we know the state\nx\nxy\ny\nof strain at any point in the body. We can then write our equation for computing\nthe extensional strain in any arbitrary direction in terms of these three strain com\nponents associated with the x,y frame at a point as:\nsin\nεPQ = ε ⋅cos φ2 + γ\n⋅cos φ\nφ\n\n+ ε ⋅sin φ2\nx\nxy\ny\nFinally, note that if we are given the displacement components as continuous\nfunctions x and y we can, by taking the appropriate partial derivatives, compute a\nset of strain functions, also continuous in x,y. On the other hand, going the other\nway, given the three strain components, ε , γ , ε\nas continuous functions of posi\nx\nxy\ny\ntion, we cannot be assured that we can determine unique, continuous functions for\nthe two displacement components from an integration of the strain-displacement\nrelations. We say that the strains represent a compatible state of deformation only\nif we can do so, that is, only if we can construct a continuous displacement field\nfrom the strain components.\nExercise 6.2\nFor the planar displacement field defined by\ny\n+1\n(\n(\nu x, y) = -κ ⋅xy\nv x, y) = κ ⋅x 2 ⁄ 2\n-1\nwhere κ = 0.25, sketch the locus of the edges of a 2x2\n+1\nsquare, centered at the origin, after deformation and\n-1\nconstruct expressions for the strain components ε , ε ,\nx\ny\nand γ xy\nWe start by evaluating the components of strain; we obtain\n∂u\nκ\n∂v\nεx ≡∂\n∂u\nx = -κy\n= - x + κx = 0\nε ≡\n= 0\nγ xy ≡\n\n∂\n∂v\nx + ∂y\ny\n∂y\nWe see that the only non zero strain is the extensional strain in the x direction\nat every point in the plane. In particular, right angles formed by the intersection of\na line segment in the x direction with another in the y direction remain right angles\nsince the shear strain vanishes. The average rotation of these intersecting line seg\nments at each and every point is found to be\nx\n\nChapter 6\nω\n= (1 2)∂v - ∂y = κx\nxy\n⁄\n∂x\n∂u\nWe sketch the locus of selected points and line segments below:\ny\ny\n+1\n+1\nx\nx\n-1\n-1\n+1\n+1\n-1\n-1\nFocus first, on the figure at the left above which shows the deformed position\nof the points that originally lay along the x axis, at y=0. The vertical component of\ndisplacement v describes a parabola in the deformed state. Furthermore, the points\nalong the x axis experience no horizontal displacement.\nOn the other hand, the points off the x or the y axis all have a horizontal com\nponent of displacement - as well as vertical. Consider now the figure above right.\nFor example the point (1,1) moves to the left a distance 0.25 while moving up a\ndistance 0.125. Below the x axis, however, the point originally at (1,-1) moves to\nthe right 0.25 while it still displaces upward the same 0.125. The shaded lines are\nmeant to indicate the u at each point.\nObserve\n- The state of strain does not vary with x, but does so with y.\n- Right angles formed by x-y line segments remain right angles, that is the\nshear strain is zero.\n- The average rotations of these right angles does vary with x but not with\ny. Note too that we have seemingly violated the assumption of small rota\ntions. We did so in order to better illustrate the deformed pattern.\n6.2\nTransformation of Components of Strain\nThe axial stress in a truss member is related to the extensional strain in the mem\nber through an equation that looks very much like that which relates the force in a\nspring to its deflection. We shall relate all stress and strain components through\nsome more general constitutive relations -- equations which bring the specific\nproperties of the material into the picture. But stress and strain are \"relations\" in\nanother sense, in a more abstract, mathematical way: They are both the same kind\nof mathematical entity. The criterion and basis for this claim is the following:\nThe components of stress and strain at a point transform according to the\n\nChapter 6\nsame equations. By transform we mean change; by change we mean change due\nto a rotation of our reference axis at the point.\nOur study of how the components of strain and stress transform is motivated as\nmuch by the usefulness of this knowledge in engineering practice as by visions of\nmathematical elegance and sophistication4. For, although this section could have\nbeen labeled the transformation of symmetric, second-order tensors, we have\nalready seen an example, back in our study of stress, an example suggesting the\npotential utility of the component transformation machinery. We do an exercise\nvery similar to that we tackled before to refresh our memory.\nExercise 6.3\nThree strain gages, attached to the surface of a solid shaft in torsion in the\ndirections x, y, and x' measure the three extensional strains\n\nε = 0\nεy = 0\nand\nεx' = 0.00032\nx\nEstimate the shear strain γxy.\nx\nx'\ny\nMt\nLet's work backwards. No one\nsays you have to work forward\nfrom the \"givens\" straight through\nto the answer5.\nWe are given the values of three extensional strains measured at a point on the\nsurface of the shaft6. The task is to determine the shear strain at the point from\nthe three, measured extensional strains.\nFrom the previous section we know that the extensional strain in the x' direc\ntion - thinking of that direction as \"PQ\" - can be expressed as\nεPQ = ε ⋅ cos φ2 + γ\n⋅ cos φsin φ + εy ⋅ sin φ2 ,\nx\nxy\nwhich tells me how to compute the extensional strain in some arbitrarily oriented direction\nat a point, as defined by the angle φ, given the state of strain at the point as defined by the\nthree components of strain with respect to an x,y axis.\nWorking backwards, I will use this to compute the shear strain γxy given knowl\nedge of the extensional strain εPQ where PQ is read as the direction of the gage x'\n4. Katie: See Reid...I told you so!\n5. This is characteristic of most work, not only in engineering but in science as well. The desired end state - the\nanswer to the problem, the basic form of a design, the theorem to be proven, the character of the data to be\ncollected - is usually known at the outset. There are really very few surprises in science or engineering in this\nrespect. What is surprising, and exciting, and rewarding is that you can manage to construct things to come\nout right and they work according to your expectations.\n6. It's not really a point but a region about the size of a small coin.\n\nChapter 6\noriented at 45o to the axis of the shaft and pasted to its surface. Now both εx and\nε are zero7 so this equation gives\n⁄\ny\n0.000032 = γ\n⋅(1 2)\nor\n\nγ xy = 0.00064\nxy\nObserve:\n- If the strains ε and ε were different from zero we would still use this\nx\ny\nrelationship to obtain an estimate of the shear strain. The former would\nprovide us with direct estimates of any axial or hoop strain.\n- I can graphically interpret this equation for determining the shear strain\nby constructing a compatible (continuous) displacement field from the\nstrain components εx, εy, and γxy. Note this is not the only displacement\nfield I might generate that is consistent with these strain components but it\nwill serve to illustrate the relationship.\n∆x\nx\ny\nb\nt\nt = (1/√2) i + (1/√2) j\n∆v(√\nc\n∆v\n∆v\na\n∆v\n2/2)=change in length of ob\nWith the shaft oriented horizontally and twisted as shown, I take the displace\nment component, u(x,y) to be zero and v(x,y) to be proportional to x but indepen\ndent of y. Then the points a and b both displace vertically a distance ∆v with\nrespect to points 0 and c. The extension of the diagonal 0b is, for small displace\nments and rotations, the projection of ∆v at b upon the diagonal itself. So the\nchange in length is given by ∆v ⁄ ( 2) . Its original length is\n2 ⋅∆x so we can\n(∆v ⁄ ∆x)\nwrite εx' = εob = ---------------------\nBut, again for small rotations, ∆v/∆x = γxy the decrease in the right angle, the\nshear strain. Thus, as before,\nεx' = γ xy ⋅(1 2)\n⁄\n7. More realistic values would be some small, insignificant numbers due to noise or slight imbalance in the\napparatus used to measure, condition, and amplify the signal produced by the strain gage. Even so, if the\nshaft was subject to forms of loading other than, and in addition to the torque we seek to estimate, and these\nengendered significant strains in the a and c directions we would still make use of this relationship in estimat\ning the shear strain.\n\nChapter 6\nThis exercise illustrates an application of the\nrules governing the transformation of the compo-\ny'\ny\nnents of strain at a point. That's now the way we\nread the equation we in the previous section - as a\nway to obtain the extensional strain along one\naxis of an arbitrarily oriented coordinate frame at\na point in terms of the strain components known\nwith respect to some reference coordinate frame.\nx'\nFor example, if I let the arbitrarily oriented frame be\nφ\nlabeled x'-y', then the extensional strain components\nrelative to this new axis system can be written in terms of the strain components associated\nwith the original, x-y frame as\nε' = ε ⋅ cos φ2 + γ\n⋅ cos φsin φ + ε ⋅ sin φ2\nx\nx\nxy\ny\nε' = ε ⋅ cos φ2 - γ\n⋅ cos φsin φ + ε ⋅ sin φ2\ny\nx\nxy\ny\nIn obtaining the expression for the extensional strain in the y' direction, I substituted φ + π/\n2 for φ in the first equation.\nBut there is more to the story. I must construct an equation that allows me to\ncompute the shear strain, γ'xy relative to the arbitrarily oriented frame, x'y'. To\ndo so I make use of the same graphical methods of the previous section.\nThe figure below left shows the orientation of my reference x-y axis and the\norientation of an arbitrarily oriented frame x'-y'. PQ is a differential line element\nin the undeformed state lying along the x' axis. t is a unit vector along PQ; e is a\nunit vector perpendicular to PQ in the sense shown. ∆x, ∆y are the horizontal and\nvertical coordinates of Q relative to the origin of the reference frame.\ny\ny'\ny' y\nR\nα\nβ\nQ'\nx\nφ\n∆y\nQ x'\nR\n∆uR\nR'\nj' = - sinφ i + cosφ j\nφ\nQ\nx'\n∆y\nx\n∆uQ\nP\n∆x\nj\nP,P'\n∆x\ni\nBefore\nAfter\nOn the right we show the position of PQ in the deformed state as P'Q'. The dis\nplacement of point Q relative to P is shown as ∆ uQ. The angle α is the (small)\nrotation of the line element PQ. This is what we seek to express in terms of the\nstrain components ε , ε and γ\nat the point. We will also determine the rotation\nx\ny\nxy\nof a line element along the y' axis. Knowing these we can compute the change in\nx\n\nChapter 6\nthe right angle QPR , the shear strain component with respect to the x'-y' system\nwhich we will mark with a \"prime\", γ '.\nxy\nThe angle α is given approximately by\nα = ∆u\nj' ⁄ (PQ)\nwhere j' is per\n-\npendicular to PQ.\nThe displacement vector we write as ∆u = ∆u ⋅ i + ∆v ⋅ j\nwhich, to first order\nmay be written in terms of the partial derivatives of the scalar components of the\nrelative displacement of Q.\n∂v\n∆u = ∆x ∂u + ∆y ∂u i + ∆x ∂v + ∆y∂y j\n\n∂x\n∂y\n\n∂x\nand the unit vector is\nj' = - sin φ ⋅ i + cos φ ⋅ j\nCarrying out the scalar, dot product, noting that\n⁄\n⁄\n∆y PQ = cos φ\nand\n∆y PQ = sin φ\nwe obtain\n∂u\n∂v\n∂v\nα ≈- sin φ\ncos φ∂u + sin φ∂y + cos φcos φ\n+ sin φ\n∂x\n\n∂x\n∂y\nOr collecting terms\n∂v\n∂u\nα ≈ sin φcos φ∂v - ∂u + cos2 φ\n- sin2 φ\n∂y ∂x\n∂x\n∂y\nI obtain the angle β the rotation of a line segment PR originally oriented along\nthe y' axis most simply by letting φ go to φ +π/2 in the above equation for the\nangle α. Thus\n∂v\n∂u\nβ ≈- sin φcos φ∂v - ∂u + sin2 φ\n- cos2 φ\n∂y ∂x\n∂x\n∂y\nthe diminution in the right angle QPR is just α - β so I obtain:\n∂u\nγ' ≈2 sin φcos φ\n\n∂\n∂\nv\ny - ∂\n∂\nu\nx\n\n+ (cos2 φ - sin2 φ)∂v -\nxy\n∂x ∂y\nwhich, in terms of the strain components associated with the x,y axes becomes\nγ'\n= 2(εy - ε ) ⋅ sin φcos φ + γ xy ⋅(cos φ2 - sin φ )\nxy\nx\nWith this I have all the machinery I need to compute the components of strain\nwith respect to one orientation of axes at a point given their values with respect to\nanother. I summarize below, making use of the double angle identities for the cosφ\nand the sinφ, namely, cos 2φ =cos2φ - sin2φ and sin2φ =2sinφcosφ.\n\n-------------------\n-------------------\n-------------------\n-------------------\n-------------------\nChapter 6\nε' x\nεx\nεy\n+\n(\n)\n-\nεx\nεy\n-\n(\n)\n-\n2φ\ncos\n⋅\nγ xy 2\n⁄\n(\n)\n2φ\nsin\n+\n+\n=\nε' y\nεx\nεy\n+\n(\n)\n-\nεx\nεy\n-\n(\n)\n-\n2φ\ncos\n⋅\n-\nγ xy 2\n⁄\n(\n)\n-\n2φ\nsin\n=\nγ' xy 2\n⁄\n(\n)\nεx\nεy\n-\n(\n)\n-\n-\n2φ\nsin\n⋅\nγ xy 2\n⁄\n(\n)\n2φ\ncos\n+\n=\nI have introduced a common factor of (1/2) in the equation for the shear strain\nfor the following reasons: If you compare these transformation relationships with\nthose we derived for the components of stress, back in chapter 4, you will see they\nare identical in form if we identify the normal strain components with their corre\nsponding normal stress components but we must identify τxy with γxy/2.\nOne additional relationship about deformation follows from our analysis: If I\naverage the angular rotations of the two orthogonal line segments PQ and PR, I\nobtain an expression for what we define as the rotation of the x'-y' axes at the\npoint. This produces\n--\n+\n--\nω'\n= (α\nβ) = ∂v - ∂u= ωxy\nxy\n\n∂x ∂y\nThis, we note, is identical to ω\nwhich is what justifies labeling this measure\nxy\nof deformation a rigid body rotation. It is also invariant of the transformation;\nregardless of the orientation of the coordinate frame at the point, you will always\nget the same number for this measure of rotation.\nExercise 6.4\nA \"bug\" in my graphics software distorts the image appearing on my moni\ntor. Horizontal lines are stretched 1%; vertical lines are compressed 5%\nand there is a distortion of the right angles formed by the intersection of\nhorizontal and vertical lines of approximately 3o - a decrease in right\nangle in the first quadrant. Estimate the maximum extensional distortion I\ncan anticipate for an arbitrarily oriented line drawn by my software. What\nis the orientation of this particular line relative to the horizontal?\nI seek a maximum value for the extensional strain at a point -- the extensional\nstrain of an arbitrarily oriented line segment which is maximum. Any point on the\nscreen will serve; we are working with a homogeneous state of strain, one which\ndoes not vary with position. I also of course want to know the direction of this line\nsegment. The equation above for ε ' shows the extensional strain as a function of\nx\n\nChapter 6\nφ; we differentiate with respect to φ seeking the value for the angle which will\ngive a maximum (or minimum) extensional strain. I have:\ndε' x = -(εy - ε )sin 2φ\nγ xy ⋅cos 2φ = 0\n+\nx\ndφ\nwhich I manipulate to\ntan 2φ = γ\n⁄ (εy - ε )\nxy\nx\nNow the three x,y components of strain are ε =0.01, ε = -0.05, and γ\n= 3/\nx\ny\nxy\n57.3 = 0.052. The above relationship, because of the behavior of the tangent func\ntion, will give me two roots within the range 0 < φ < 360o, hence two values of φ.\nI obtain two possibilities for the angle of orientation of maximum (or mini\nmum) extensional strain, φ = 20.6o and φ = 20.6 + 90o= 110.6o One of these will\ncorrespond to a maximum extensional strain, the other to a minimum. Note that\nwe can read the second root as an extensional strain in a direction perpendicular to\nthat associated with the first root. In other words, if we evaluate both ε ' and\nx\nε 'for a rotation of φ = 20.6o we will find one a maximum the other a minimum.\ny\nThis we do now.\nTaking then, φ= 20.6o I obtain for the extensional strain in that direction,\nε = 0.0197\nI\nabout two percent extension. The extensional strain at right angles to this I obtain from the\nequation for ε ', a strain along an axis 110.6o around from the horizontal, εII = - 0.0597,\ny\nabout six percent contraction.

We turn again to our graphical rendering of these\nrelationships called Mohr's Circle. I have set out the rules for constructing the cir\ncle for a particular state of stress.

      "content": "Material Properties and Failure Phenomena\nUp until now we have not said much about the way structures behave in the so-\ncalled \"real world\". Our focus has been on abstract concepts and pictures, with\ngenerous use made of mathematics in the formulation and solution of problems.\nThere have been exceptions: We have talked about the properties of a rod, how we\ncould measure the stress at which it would yield. We have talked about linear\nforce/deflection relations and how we could measure the rod's stiffness, k. But our\nelaboration and application of the principles of equilibrium and compatibility of\ndeformation have not required any reference to the things of the material world:\nCompatibility of deformation is a matter of the displacement of points, their abso-\nlute and relative displacement (when we talk about strain). Equilibrium of force\nand of moment concerns concepts that are just as abstract as displacements of\npoints and rotations of infinitessimal line segments - if not more so. Constructing\na free body diagram is an abstract, intellectual activity. No one goes out and actu-\nally cuts through the truss to determine the forces within its members.\nIn this chapter, we confront the world of different structural materials and their\nactual behavior. We want to know how the stiffness, k, depends upon the actual\nmaterial constitution of our beam, or truss member, or concrete mix. We want to\nknow how great a weight we can distribute over the beam or hang from the nodes\nof a truss before failure. We summarize our interests with two bullets:\n- What properties characterize the behavior of a linear, elastic structural ele-\nment? What is the general form of the stress/strain relations for an isotro-\npic continuum?\n- What conditions can lead to failure of a structure?\nWe begin with our elaboration of the constitutive relations for a continuum.\n7.1\nStress/Strain Relations\nWe want to develop a set of stress/strain relations for a continuous body, equations\nwhich apply at each and every point throughout the continuum. In this we will\nrestrict our attention, at least in this chapter, to certain type of materials namely\nhomogeneous, linear, elastic, isotropic bodies.\n- Homogeneous means that the properties of the body do not vary from one\npoint in the body to another.\n\n200 Chapter 7\n- Linear means that the equations relating stress and strain are linear;\nchanges in stress are directly proportional to changes in strain (and the\nother way around, too).\n- Elastic means that the body returns to its original, undeformed configura-\ntion when the applied forces and/or moments are removed.\n- Isotropic means that the stress strain relations do not change with direction\nat a point. This means that a laminated material, a material with a pre-\nferred orientation of \"grains\" at the microscopic level, are outside our field\nof view, at least for the moment.\nWe have talked about stress at a point. We drew a\nfigure like the one at the right to help us visualize the\nnature of the normal and shear components of stress at\na point. We say the state of stress is fully specified by\nthe normal components, σx, σy σz and the shear com-\nponents σxy=σyx, σyz=σzy σxz=σzx.\nWith these restrictions and a heavy dose of symme-\ntry, we will be able to construct a set of stress/strain\nequations that will apply to many structural materials.\nThis we do now, performing a sequence of thought experiments in which we apply\nto an element of stuff at a point each stress component in turn and imagine what\nstrains will be engendered, which ones will not. Again, symmetry will be crucial\nto our constructions. We start by applying the normal stress component σx alone.\nWe expect to see some extensional strain εx. This we take as proportional to the\nnormal stress we apply, in accord with the second bullet above; that is we set\nIn this we have made use of another bit of real exper-\nimental evidence in designating the constant of pro-\nportionality\nin\nthe\nrelationship\nbetween\nthe\nextensional strain in the direction of the applied nor-\nmal stress to be the elastic, or Young's modulus, E.\nWe might not anticipate normal strains in the other\ntwo coordinate directions but there is nothing to rule\nthem out, so we posit an εy and an εz.\nNow εy and εz, because of the indifference of the material to the orientation of\nthe y and the z axis,- that is, from symmetry- must be equal. We can say nothing\nmore on the basis of our symmetrical thoughts alone.\nAt this point we introduce another real piece of experimental data, namely that\nthe material contracts in the y and z directions as it extends in the x direction due\nto the applied σx. We write then, for the strains due to a σx:\nThe ratio of the lateral contraction in the y and z directions to the extension in\nthe x direction, the so called Poisson's ratio is designated by the symbol ν. We\nx\ny\nz\nσx\nσz\nσxy\nσxz\nσzy\nσzx\nσy\nσyz\nσyx\nεx\nσx E\n⁄\n=\nσx\nσx\nσx\nσx\nεy\nεz\nυεx\nυ σx E\n⁄\n⋅\n-\n=\n-\n=\n=\n\n201 Chapter 7\nhave encountered the magnitude of the elastic modulus E for 1020, cold rolled\nsteel in the previous chapter. Poisson's ratio, ν is new; it takes on values on the\norder of one-quarter to one-half, the latter value characterizing an1 incompressible\nmaterial.\nBut what about the shear strains? Does σx engender any shear strains? The\nanswer is no and here symmetry is all that we need to reach this conclusion. The\nsketch below shows two possible configurations for the shear strain γxy. Both are\nequally possible to an unbiased observer. But which one will follow the applica-\ntion of σx?\nThere is no reason why one or the other should occur.2 Indeed they are in con-\ntradiction to one another; that is, if you say the one at the left occurs, I, by running\naround to the other side of the page, or more easily, by imagining the bit on the\nleft rotated 180o about a vertical axis, can obtain the configuration at the right.\nBut this is impossible. These two dramatically different configurations cannot\nexist at the same time. Hence, neither of them is a possibility; a normal stress σx\nwill not induce a γxy, or for that matter, a γxz shear strain.\nBy similar symmetry arguments, not provided here, we can rule out the possi-\nbility of a γyz.We conclude, then, that under the action of the stress component σx\nalone, we obtain only the extensional strains written out above.\nOur next step is to apply a stress component σy alone. Now since the body is\nisotropic, it does not differentiate between the x and y directions. Hence our task\nis easy; we simply replace x by y (and y by x) in the above relationships and we\nhave that, under the action of the stress component σy alone, we obtain the exten-\nsional strains\n1. In fact, Poisson proved that, for an isotropic body, Poisson's ratio should be exactly one-quarter. We claim\ntoday that he was working with a faulty model of the continuum. For some relevant history on early nine-\nteenth century developments in the continuum theories see Bucciarelli and Dworsky, SOPHIE GERMAIN, an\nEssay in the Development of the Theory of Elasticity\n2. Think of the icon at the top as Buridan's ass, the two below as bales of hay.\nσx\nσx\nσx\nσx\nσx\nσx\nεy\nσy E\n⁄\n=\nεx\nεz\nυ σy E\n⁄\n(\n)\n-\n=\n=\n\n202 Chapter 7\nThe same argument applies when we apply the normal stress σz alone.\nNow if we apply all three components of normal stress together, we will gen-\nerate the extensional strains, and only the extensional strain.\nOne possibility remains: What if we apply a shear stress? Will this produce an\nextensional strain component in any of the three coordinate directions? The\nanswer is no, and symmetry again rules.\nFor example, say we apply a shear\nstress, σxy. The figure below shows two possible, shortly to be shown impossible,\ngeometries of deformation which include extensional straining.\nNow I imagine rotating the one on the left about an axis inclined at 45o as indi-\ncated. I produce the configuration on the right. Try this with a piece of rectangular paper, a 3 by\n5 card, or the like. But this is an impossible situation. The two configurations are\nmutually contradictory.\nA like cause, in this case a positive shear stress at the\npoint, should produce a like effect. This is not the case. Hence, neither the defor-\nmation of B nor of C is possible.\nThere remains one further possibility: that a σxy generates an extensional strain\nin the x direction equal to that in the y direction. But this too can be ruled out by\nsymmetry3. We conclude then that the shear strain σxy, or σyz or σxz for that matter,\nproduces no extensional strains.\nThe expressions for the extensional strains above are not quite complete. We\ntake the opportunity at this point to introduce another quite distinct cause of the\n3.

The effect of a temperature\nchange- say ∆T - is to produce an extensional strain proportional to the change.\nThat is, for an isotropic body,\nThe coefficient of thermal expansion, α, has units of 1/oC or 1/oF and for most\nstructural materials is a positive quantity on the order of 10-6. Materials with a\nnegative coefficient of expansion deserve to be labeled exotic. They are few and\nfar between.\nThe equations for the extensional components of strain in terms of stress and\ntemperature change then can be written\nIn the above, we ruled out the possibility of a shear stress producing an exten-\nsional strain. A shear stress produces, as you might expect, a shear strain. We state\nwithout demonstration that a shear stress produces only the corresponding shear\nstrain. Furthermore, a temperature change induces no shear strain at a point.\nThe\nremaining three equations relating the components of stress at a point in a linear,\nelastic, isotropic body are then.\nRecall that σxy= σyx. In these, G, the shear modulus is apparently a third elastic\nconstant but we shall show in time that G can be expressed in terms of the elastic\nmodulus and Poisson's ratio according to:\nεx or y or z\nα∆T\n=\nεx\n1 E\n⁄\n(\n)\nσx\nν σy\nσz\n+\n(\n)\n-\n[\n]\nα∆T\n+\n⋅\n=\nεy\n1 E\n⁄\n(\n)\nσy\nν σx\nσz\n+\n(\n)\n-\n[\n]\nα∆T\n+\n⋅\n=\nand\nεz\n1 E\n⁄\n(\n)\nσz\nν σx\nσy\n+\n(\n)\n-\n[\n]\nα∆T\n+\n⋅\n=\nγ xy\nσxy G\n⁄\n=\nγ xz\nσxz G\n⁄\n=\nand\nγ yz\nσyz G\n⁄\n=\nG\nE\n2 1\nυ\n+\n(\n)\n---------------------\n=\n\n204 Chapter 7\nTo proceed, we consider a special instance of a case of plane stress, i.e., one in\nwhich the \"z components\" of stress at a point are zero.\nThe special instance is\nshown in the figure, at the left.\nWe then consider the stress components acting upon a plane inclined at 45o. We\nrelate the shear stress, σ'xy, on the inclined plane to the normal stress σx through\nthe appropriate transformation relation, namely:\nWith φ = 45o this gives\nDoing the same for the strain component, γxy',\ngives\nNow we apply the stress strain relations\nto this last relationship and obtain\nBut from the transformation relationship between the stress components above,\nwe know that\n.\nFor these last two relationships to be consistent, we\nmust have\ny\nx\nσx\nx'\ny'\nσ'x\nσ'xy\nφ=45o\nσx\nσx\ny\nx\nσ'xy\nσx\nσy\n-\n(\n)\n----------------------\n-\n2φ\nsin\n⋅\nσxy\n2φ\ncos\n+\n=\nσ'xy\nσx\n2-----\n-\n=\nγ'xy\n--------\nεx\nεy\n-\n(\n)\n--------------------\n2φ\nsin\n-\nγ xy\n-------\n2φ\ncos\n+\n=\nγ'xy\n--------\nεx\nεy\n-\n(\n)\n--------------------\n-\n=\nεx\n1 E\n⁄\n(\n) σx\n⋅\n=\nεy\n1 E\n⁄\n(\n)\nνσx\n-\n[\n]\n⋅\n=\nand\nγ'xy\nσ'xy G\n⁄\n=\nσ'xy\n2G\n---------\nυ\n+\n(\n)\n2E\n-----------------σx\n-\n=\nσ'xy\nσx\n2-----\n-\n=\nG\nE\n2 1\nυ\n+\n(\n)\n---------------------\n=\n\n205 Chapter 7\n7.2\nProperties of Ordinary Structural Materials\nContrary to my introductory remarks at the outset of this chapter, it seems we have\nproceeded abstractly in our exploration of the constitution of structural materials.\nThe reason for this is that thinking things through is relatively cheap and inexpen-\nsive work compared to doing actual experiments in the real world. If we can figure\nout some ways in which our materials might, or must, behave by thinking\nabstractly about continuity and symmetry, about stress and strain, about rotation\nof axes - all the while making sure our analysis is logical and coherent - we have\nestablished a solid basis for fixing the behavior of real materials in the real world.\nThis as long as our materials fit the assumptions of our model as set out in the bul-\nlets at the outset of this chapter4. Still, it doesn't give us the full picture, the full\nstory; eventually we have to go into the lab to pull apart the actual stuff. To get\nour hands dirty, we explore how a bar in tension behaves.\nForce/Deformation - Uniaxial Tension.\nWe have already said a few words about the failure of a truss member in ten-\nsion - how a material like aluminum or steel will begin to yield or a more brittle\nmaterial fracture when the tensile stress in the member becomes too large in mag-\nnitude. We want to say more now; in particular, we want to attend to the deforma-\ntions that occur in a bar under uniaxial tension and look more closely at the\nmechanisms responsible for either brittle fracture or the onset of yield.\nThe tension test5 is a standard test for\ncharacterizing the behavior of bars under\nuniaxial load. The test consists of pulling\non a circular shaft, nominally a centimeter\nin diameter, and measuring the applied\nforce and the relative displacement of two\npoints on the surface of the shaft in-line\nwith its axis. As the load P increases from\nzero on up until the specimen breaks, the\nrelative distance between the two points\nincreases from L0 to some final length just\nbefore separation. The graph at the right\nindicates the trace of data points one might\nobtain for load P versus ∆L where\n4. Recall how difficulties arise if there is a misfit - if our model is not appropriate as was the case concerning the\nbehavior of the student in a chair on top of a table tilted up.\n5.\nStandard tests for material properties, for failure stress levels, and the like are well documented in the Amer-\nican Society for Testing Materials, ASTM, publications. Go there for the description of how to conduct a ten-\nsile test.\nLo\nL\nP\nP\nA\n∆L\nP\n∆L\nL\nLo\n-\n=\n\n206 Chapter 7\nNow, If we were to double the cross-sectional area, A, we would expect to have\nto double the load to obtain the same change in length of the two points on the surface.\nThat indeed is the case, as Galileo was aware. Thus, we can extend our results obtained\nfrom a single test on a specimen of cross sectional area A and length L0 to another speci-\nmen of the same length but different area if we plot the ratio of load to area, the tensile\nstress, in place of P.\nSimilarly, if, instead of plotting the change in length, ∆L, of the two points, we\nplot the stress against the ratio of the change in length to the original length between the\ntwo points our results will be applicable to specimens of varying length. The ratio of\nchange in length to original length is just the extensional strain.\nWe, as customary, designate the tensile stress by σ and the extensional strain by\nε; We assume that the load P is uniformly distributed over the cross sectional area A and\nthat the relative displacement is \"uniformly distributed\" over the length L0. Both stress and\nstrain are rigorously defined as the limits of these ratios as either the area or the original\nlength between the two points approaches zero. Alternatively, we could speak of an aver-\nage stress over the section as defined by\nand an average strain as defined by\nThe figure below left shows the results of a test of 1020, Cold Rolled Steel.\nStress, σ is plotted versus strain ε. The figure below right shows an abstract representation\nof the stress-strain behavior as elastic, perfectly plastic material.\nObserve:\n- The plot shows a region where the stress is proportional to the strain. The\nlinear relation which holds within this region is usually written\nσ\nP A\n⁄\n≡\nε\n∆L\n(\n) Lo\n⁄\n≡\nε = ∆L/Lo\nσ = P/A\n0.002\n600MN/m2\nε\nσ\nσY\nE\nσ\nE ε\n⋅\n=\n\n207 Chapter 7\nwhere E is the coefficient of elasticity of 1020CR steel - 30 x 106 lb/in2.\n- The behavior of the bar in this region is called elastic. Elastic means that\nwhen the load is removed, the bar returns to its original, undeformed\nconfiguration. That is L returns to L0. There is no permanent set6.\n- The relative displacements of points -- the strains in the elastic region --\nare very small, generally insensible without instruments to amplify their\nmagnitude. To \"see\" a relative displacement of two points originally 100\nmm apart when the stress is on the order of 400 Mega Newtons/m2 your\neyes would have to be capable of resolving a relative displacement of the\ntwo points of 0.2 mm! Strains in most structural materials are on the order\nof tenths of a percent at most.\n- At some stress level, the bar does not return to its undeformed shape after\nremoving the load. This stress level is called the yield strength. The yield\nstrength defines the limit of elastic behavior; beyond the yield point the\nmaterial behaves plastically. In most materials definition of a nominal\nvalue for the yield strength is a matter of convention. Whether or not the\nmaterial has returned to its original shape upon removal of the load\ndepends upon the resolution of the instrument used to measure relative\ndisplacement. The convention of using an offset relies upon the gross\nbehavior of the material but this is generally all we need in engineering\npractice. In the graphs above, we show the yield strength defined at a 2%\noffset, that is, as the intersection of the experimentally obtained stress-\nstrain curve with a straight line of slope E intersecting the strain axis at a\nstrain of 0.002. Its value is approximately 600 MN/m2.\n- Loading of the bar beyond the yield strength engenders very large relative\ndisplacements for relatively small further increments in the stress, σ. Note\nthat the stress is defined as the ratio of the load to the original area; once\nwe enter the region of plastic deformation, of plastic flow, the bar will\nbegin to neck down and the cross sectional area at some point along the\nlength will diminish. The true stress at this section will be greater than σ\nplotted here.\n- For some purposes, it is useful to idealize the behavior of the material in\ntension as elastic, perfectly plastic; that is, the yield strength fixes the\nmaximum load the material can support. This fantasy would have the\nmaterial stretch out to infinite lengths once the yield strength was reached.\nFor most engineering work, a knowledge of yield strength is all we need.\nWe design to make sure that our structures never leave the elastic region.7\n6. Note that linear behavior and elastic behavior are independent traits; one does not necessarily imply the\nother. A rubber band is an example of an elastic, non-linear material and you can design macro structures that\nare non-linear and elastic. Linear, inelastic materials are a bit rarer to find or construct.\n7. On the other hand, if you are designing energy absorbing barriers, machine presses for cold rolling or form-\ning materials and the like, plastic behavior will become important to you.\n\n208 Chapter 7\nExercise 7.1\nA steel bolt, of 1/2 inch diameter, is surrounded by an aluminum cylindrical\nsleeve of 3/4\" diameter and wall thickness, t= 0.10 in. The bolt has 32\nthreads/inch and when the material is at a temperature of 40oC the nut is\ntightened one-quarter turn. Show that the uniaxial stresses acting in the\nbolt and in the sleeve at this temperature are\nσbolt = 79 MN/m2,\nand\nσsleeve = - 63 MN/m2where the negative sign indicates the aluminum sleeve\nis in compression. What if the bolt and nut are cooled; at what temperature\nmight the bolt become loose in the sleeve?\nCompatibility of Deformation\nCompatibility of Deformation is best assured by playing\nout a thought experiment about how the bolt and sleeve\ngo from their initial unstressed, undeformed state to the\nfinal state. Think of the bolt and nut being separate from\nthe sleeve. Think then of turning down the nut one quarter\nturn.\nWe show this state at the left, belo. ∆is the distance trav-\neled in one quarter turn which, at 1/32 inch/turn is\n∆ = 1/128 in\nNext think of stretching the bolt out until we can once again fit the nut-bolt\nover the aluminum sleeve, the latter still in its undeformed state. This is shown in\nthe middle figure below. Now, while stretching out the bolt in this way, replace the\naluminum sleeve8 then let go. The bolt will strive to return to its undeformed\nlength - the behavior is assumed to be elastic - while the aluminum sleeve will\nresist contraction. The final state is shown at the right. The net result is that the\nsteel bolt has extended from its undeformed state a distance dbwhile the alumi-\nnum sleeve has contracted a distance ds. We see from the geometry of these three\n8.

Test that load a cylindrical specimen in torsion are used to measure the\nshear modulus G. Knowing E and G, Poisson's ratio may be obtained from the\nrelationship we derived in the previous section.\nWhat follows is a table giving the elastic properties and failure stresses in ten-\nsion (and/or compression) for common structural materials. \"Failure\" means that\nordinarily you want to design your structure such that you do not come close to\nthis value under anticipated loading conditions.\nThe variety of materials included is meant to give the reader some idea of the\nrange of property values of different kinds of structural materials. The values\nthemselves are only meant to indicate orders of magnitude. In some cases, where\nthe range of property values for a material is so large due to differences in compo-\nsition or quality of its fabrication, a range has been shown. And certainly the table\nis not meant to be complete, nor should the values be used in detailed design\nwork.\nMaterial\nSpecific\nElastic Modulus\nFailure Stress\nα\nGravity\n106 psi\n109 N/m2\n103 psi\n106 N/m2\n10-6 /oC\nAl 2024-T3\n2.7\nAl 6061-T6\n2.6\nAl 7075-T6\n2.7\nConcrete\n2.3\n3 - 6a\n20 - 40\n7-12\nHigh Strength\n2.3\n3 - 5\n20 - 35\n5-12\n35 - 80\n7-12\nCopper\nGlass Fiber\n2.7\nIron (cast)\n20-40\n150-300\nSteel High Strength\n50-150\n300-1000\nSteel Structural\n40-100\n250-700\ne.g., AISI C1020\nTitanium\nWood (pine)\n0.5\n1.4\n\n211 Chapter 7\nIn all of this, failure stress is no unique number; in contrast to the elastic mod-\nulus, E, which is safe to take as a single value across different varieties and com-\npositions of a material9, the failure stress will vary all over the lot depending upon\ncomposition, care and means of fabrication. Compare the yield stress of cold\nrolled versus hot-rolled 1020 steel. Note too that one does not design to the failure\nstress but to a level significantly less than the numbers in the table. A factor of\nsafety is always introduced to ensure that internal loads in the structure stay well\nbelow the failure level.\n7.4\nFailure Phenomena\nFailure comes in different guises, in different sizes, colors, shapes, and with dif-\nferent labels. We have talked about yielding, the onset of plastic flow of ductile\nmaterials - materials which show relatively large, even sensible, deformations for\nrelatively small increases in load once the material is loaded beyond its yield\nstrength. If the excessive load is removed before complete collapse, the structure\nwill not wholly return to its original, undeformed configuration.\nAlthough it is the tension test that is used to fix the limit of elastic behavior\nand to define a yield strength, the mechanism for yielding is a shearing action of\nthe material on a microscopic level. We have seen how a tensile stress in a bar can\nproduce a shear stress on a plane inclined to the axis of the bar.\nThe figure shows the Mohr's\nCircle for a bar subjected to uniax-\nial tension. The maximum shear\nstress occurs on planes oriented at\n45o to the axis of the bar. Its value\nis\none-half\nthe\napplied\ntensile\nstress. This then can be taken as a\ncriterion for the onset of yield of a\nductile\nmaterial:\nWhenever\nthe\nmaximum shear stress at any point\nwithin any element of a structure\nexceeds one-half the applied tensile\nstress at the yield point in a tension\ntest, the element will yield10\na. In Compression\n9. Concrete is an exception. Indeed it is difficult to find a linear portion of the stress/strain data taken from a\nspecimen in compression.\n10. In a general state of stress, the maximum shear stress is given by one-half the maximum difference of the\n(three) principle stresses. In the uniaxial tension test, this is just one-half the tensile stress as shown in the fig-\nure.\nσ'x\nσ'xy\nφ\nW\nσx\nW\nσyx\nσxy\nσ\n(σx,0)\n(0,0)\nσ'xy =σx/2\nφ=45o\n2φ\n\n212 Chapter 7\nNot all materials behave as steel or aluminum or ductile plastics. Some materi-\nals are brittle. Load glass, cast iron, a brittle plastic, a carbon fiber, or concrete in\na tension test and they will break with very little extension. They show insensible\ndeformation all the way up to the fracture load. Recall the exercise in chapter 4\nwhere we subjected a piece of chalk to torsion and how this generated a maximum\ntensile stress on a plane inclined at 45o to a generator on the surface of the chalk.\nMetals generally carry a tensile or compressive load equally well. Concrete\ncan not. Concrete generally can carry but one-tenth its allowable compressive load\nwhen subject to tension. A different sort of test is required to measure the tensile\nstrength of concrete.

For example, in a composite material or\nstructural element - a member made up of two different materials11- careful atten-\ntion must be paid to the interface of the different materials out of which the mem-\nber is made. We will consider some examples of composite structural elements in\nour chapter on the behavior of beams.\nAnother violation of homogeneity can prove disastrous: If the material, sup-\nposed continuous and uniform, contains an imperfection e.g., a microscopic crack,\nunseen by the naked eye even if on the surface, then all bets are off. (Rather all\nbets are on)! A crack can be the occasion for the magnification of stress levels in\nits immediate neighborhood.\nThis is one good reason why you see fillets at\ncorners within a machined part. For example,\none would never make a tensile test specimen\nin the shape shown at the top of the figure. The\nsharp corners where the two cylinders of dif-\nfering diameters meet would engender a stress\nlevel at that junction significantly greater than\nthe tensile stress found at the middle of the\nspecimen, away from the junction.\nA classic example of how a discontinuity within the interior of a material can\nact as a stress raiser is the solution obtained from the theory of elasticity for the\nstress field around a hole in a thin plate.\nThe figure at the right shows the effect of a\ncircular hole on the stress component σx engen-\ndered in a thin plate subjected to a uniform tensile\nstress in the x direction. We show only the normal\nstress component σx acting on an x face which is a\ncontinuation of the vertical diameter of the hole.\nThe hole gives rise to a stress concentration three\ntimes the magnitude of the uniformly applied ten-\nsile stress12.\nSo far in our discussion we have been con-\ncerned with static loading conditions, i.e., we\ndetermine the internal stresses and static dis-\nplacements due to loading - such as a dead weight. But some failure phenomena\ntake time to develop. Even if there is no perceptible dynamic displacement or\nmotion, materials age - like you and me - with the passage of time. Material prop-\nerties and modes of failure also may depend upon temperature. What may be duc-\ntile at room temperature will be brittle at low temperatures. At high temperatures,\n11. Think of fiber reinforced skies, poles for pole vaulting, frames of tennis racquets and steel reinforced con-\ncrete slabs or beams.\n12.

Here the number of cycles may be large, on the order\nof thousands. But dynamic excitation of a structure can lead to failure in but a few\ncycles if the excitation drives a resonant mode of the system. Think of the Tacoma\nNarrows Bridge where aerodynamic excitation at the resonant frequency of a tor-\nsional mode of the structure led to ever increasing amplitude of vibration and the\neventual spectacular collapse of the span. Before this failure event, aerodynamics\nand structures were the concerns of two different worlds13.\nFailure often occurs where you are not looking for it. If you spend all of your\ntime doing models of structures made up of a large number of elements and focus\nsolely on stress levels within the elements and pay little attention to the way the\nmembers are joined together and/or fixed to ground you are headed for trouble, for\nfailure often occurs at joints.

Buckling is of this nature. We will study the buck-\nling of beam-columns in the last chapter.\nWhen we address the possibility of failure, inspection and testing become a\nnecessity. Here we move from the abstract world of the theory of elasticity to the\nworld of empirical data, manufacturers' specifications, of codes and traditional\nways of fabrication and assembly. The problem is that in the design of the new and\ninnovative structure, there is always the possibility that the codes and regulations\nand traditional ways of ensuring structural integrity do not exactly apply; some-\nthing differs from the norm. If after a careful reading of existing code, any ques-\ntion remains, a full test program might be called for.\n13.

      "content": "Stresses/Deflections Shafts in Torsion\n8.1\nAn Introductory Exercise\nWe return to the problem of torsion of circular shafts. We want to develop meth\nods to determine the shear stress distribution over the cross-section of the torque-\nbearing structural element and the rotation of any cross-section relative to\nanother. Although we limit our attention to circular cross-sections, this ought not\nto be taken to imply that only circular shafts are available to carry torsional loads.\nFor example:\nExercise 8.1\nA single bay of a truss structure, typical of the boom of a construction\ncrane, is shown below. Show that the torsional stiffness of the section 1-2-\n3-4 relative to the other, fixed section, is given by\nMT = KT φ\n⋅\nwhere\nKT = 2( AEa) ⋅( cosα) 3\nL\ny\nx\nz\na\na\nα\nα\nu1\nv1\nt16\ni\nj\nk\nMt\nL\nL\nL\nl\nα\nIn this, cosα = a/√ (a +l2) and φ is the rotation of the section 1-2-3-4.\nTo determine a stiffness we must necessarily consider displacements of the\nstructure at the four, unconstrained nodes. But since we are only interested in the\ntorsional stiffness, that is, the relation between a torque applied at the free end\nsection and the rotation of that same section, our task is lighter.\nOur method of analysis will be a displacement formulation. That is, we will\nimpose a displacement field of a particular kind, namely a rigid body rotation of\n\nChapter 8\nthe plane section 1-2-3-4 about the z axis of the structure and determine what\nforces are required to be applied at the nodes to maintain the displaced configura\ntion. Rigid here means that none of the truss members lying in the plane of this\nsection experience any change in length; their end nodes retain their same relative\npositions - the square section remains a square.\nThe figure shows the imposed rotation about the z\naxis; the rotation φ is understood to be small in the sense\n= φ a\n⋅\n⋅( 2) ⁄ 2\nu1\nthat the magnitude of the displacements of the nodes can\nbe taken as the product of the half-diagonal of the section\ni\nj\nφ\nu\nu4\nu3\n45o\na\na\n√2/2\na\nand the angle. Vector expressions for the displacements\nare then:\nu1 = (a ⁄ 2)φi + (a ⁄ 2)φj\nu2 = (a ⁄ 2)φi-(a ⁄ 2)φj\nu3 = -(a ⁄ 2)φi-(a ⁄ 2)φj\nu4 = -(a ⁄ 2)φi + (a ⁄ 2)φj\nNow if the truss members lying in the plane of the section do not deform, they\ndo not offer any resistance to rotation. But then what members do resist this par\nticular displacement field and provide the torsional stiffness?\nWe inspect them all. Consider member 1-5: If we do not allow a z displace\nment, its change in length will be zero. It is zero because, even though node #1\ndisplaces relative to node #5, the displacement vector of #1 is perpendicular to the\nmember; the projection of the displacement upon the member is zero. The same\ncan be said about members 2-6, 3-7, and 4-8.\nThe same cannot be said of member 1-6, or any of the other diagonal mem\nbers. The displacement of node #1 does have a non-zero projection upon the mem\nber 1-6, a projection tending to decrease its length when φ is positive as shown. To\ndetermine the magnitude of the contraction (as well as certifying that indeed the\nmember does contract) we proceed formally, constructing a unit vector along the\nmember in the direction outward from node #1, then determine the projection by\ntaking the scalar product of the displacement and this unit vector. The unit vector\nis\nt16 = - cos α ⋅ i + sin α ⋅ k . The change in length of the member is then\nδ16 = t16 - u1 = -(a ⁄ 2)φcos α\nLess formally, we can try to visualize how the displacement does produce a\nα\nu1=(a/2)φ\nt16\nα\nδ16 = (a/2) φ cosα\nz\nx\ncontraction. We show a top view:\nWe note that, of the two scalar components of u1, the y component, (a/2)φ j - j\nout of paper - will be perpendicular to the member and hence it will not change\n\nStresses/Deflections Shafts in Torsion\nthe member's length in any way. The same cannot be said for the other component,\nthe x component (a/2)φ i.\nHopefully it is clear that the projection of this component along the member is\njust (a/2)φ cosα as obtained from the dot product. Note that it acts to shorten mem\nber 1-6. Similarly, the other diagonal members, 2-7, 3-8, and 4-5 will also contract\nand by the same amount.\nUsing a similar argument, we can show that members 2-5, 3-6, 4-7 and 1-8 will\nextend the same amount.\nCompressive and tensile forces will then be engendered in the diagonals by\nthis particular displacement field and it is these which resist the applied torque.\n6 To see how, we make an isolation of the\nsections and require moment equilib\nrium about the z axis.\nFirst note that force equilibrium in the\nthree coordinate directions x, y, and z is\nsatisfied: Since all eight diagonal mem\nbers experience the same magnitude of\n7 extension or contraction the tensile or\ncompressive force each will experience\nwill be of the same magnitude. So at\nz\ny\nx\nMt\na\nα\nf\nf\nf\nf\neach node, the z component of one in\na\ntension will just balance the z compo\nnent of the another in compression.\nWe denote the value of the tensile load by f. Assuming a linear, elastic force-\ndeformation relationship for all diagonal members of cross-sectional area A and\nelastic modulus E, we can write:\nf = ( AE\n\n⁄ L)\n\nδ\n\n⋅\nThe magnitude of the extension or contraction of each diagonal is the same\nδ\nδ\n\n16= ( a ⁄ 2 ) ⋅\n⋅\ncos α\n=\nφ\n--------\n--------\nφ\nso\nf = AE\nδ\n⋅\n= AE ⋅( a ⁄ 2 ) ⋅φ ⋅ cos α = ( AE ⁄ 2 ) ⋅\n⋅\ncos α 2\nL\nL\na\nwhere we have used the fact that\nL = -----------\ncos α\nNow each of the diagonal members produces a moment about the z axis. More\nprecisely, the horizontal components of the member forces in the top and bottom\ndiagonals and the vertical components of the member forces in the diagonals\nalong the sides each contributes a moment of magnitude f cosα (a/2). All eight\ntogether then provide a torque resisting the imposed rotation φ of\nMT = 4af ⋅ cos α = 2aAE( cos α) 3 φ\n⋅\n\nChapter 8\nHere, then, is a structure capable of resisting torsion about its axis.\nObserve that:\n- The units check. AE has the units of force since E the elastic modulus, has\nthe units of stress or force per unit area: a has the dimensions of length so\nthe right-hand side has the dimensions of the left, that of force times\nlength, that of a moment or torque.\n- As we increase the length of the bay relative to the length of the side of the\nsquare cross-section, the angle α increases, cosα decreases, and the tor\nsional stiffness decreases - and dramatically since it goes as the cube of\nthe cosine.\n- The relationship between torque and rotation φ is linear because we\nassumed small displacements and rotations.\n- Imagine a structure built up of many of these bays fastened together. If this\nstructure includes ten bays aligned along the z axis, then the torsional stiff\nness would be one-tenth the value obtained for one bay alone since the\nover-all rotation would be the sum of ten relative rotations of the same\nmagnitude. The torque acting on each bay is the same. We might say the\ntotal angular rotation is uniformly distributed over the full string of ten\nbays.\n- We can go back and determine the forces and/or normal stresses in the\ndiagonal members given an applied torque M . We have:\nT\nMT = 4af ⋅ cos α\nso\nf = MT ⁄ (4acos α)\n- Finally, the structure is redundant. We could remove some members and\nstill carry the load. But note that if we remove one of diagonal members\nfrom each of the four sides of the bay our equilibrium requirement in the z\ndirection would not be satisfied by the force system posed. We would have\nto apply a force in the z direction at each node in order to maintain our pre\nscribed displacement field. Without this additional constraint, the nodes\nwould displace in the z direction and in an un-rotationally symmetric fash\nion. Our analysis would not go through.\nIn analyzing the torsion of a circular shaft we will proceed much the same way\nas above. We will first consider deformations due to a relative rotation of two sec\ntions of the shaft and, on the basis of symmetry, construct a compatible strain\nstate. The stress-strain equations give a corresponding stress distribution-- one\nwhich consists solely of a shear stress acting in the plane of the cross-section.\nEquilibrium, repeating the maneuvers of a previous chapter, then brings the\napplied torque into the picture and we end with an equation relating the applied\ntorque to the rotation of the shaft, a stiffness relation in form like the one derived\nabove for the truss bay.\n\nStresses/Deflections Shafts in Torsion\n8.2\nCompatibility of Deformation\nThe cross-sections of a circular shaft in torsion rotate as if they were rigid in-\nplane. That is, there is no relative displacement of any two, arbitrarily chosen\npoints of a cross section when the shaft is subjected to a torque about its longitu\ndinal, z, axis. We prove this assertion relying on rotational symmetry and upon the\nconstancy of the internal torque as we move down the axis of the shaft.\nWe first show that radial lines must remain straight by posing that they deform,\nthen show a contradiction results if we do so.\nMt\nMt\nLet the points along a radius take the shape of a curve in plane in the deformed\nstate: Now consider the same set of points but from the perspective of someone\nwho has the portion and the shaft to the right to observe. He or she would neces\nsarily see the deformed locus as shown if the same moment is to have the same\neffect. Now, however, the two cannot be put back together without leaving a hole\nwithin the interior. The two displacement fields are incompatible.\nThe only displacement pattern that will fit back together is if the locus is again\na straight line.\nIt is still possible that, while radial lines remain radial, there could be some\nsort of accordion effect as we march around the axis of the shaft - some radial\nlines coming closer together, others widening the angle between them. But no, this\nis not possible since we have complete rotational symmetry. Whatever happens at\none angular position must happen at every other angular position.\nThere remains the possibility of out of plane bulging-out and/or dishing-in.\nWhile these would not violate rotational symmetry, we rule them out using the fol\nlowing argument based upon the fact that the torque does not vary as we move\nalong the axis of the shaft.\nWe posit a bulging-out on a section of shaft when we apply a clock-wise\nmoment. Running around to the other end of the section, we would claim a bulg-\ning-out there too, since the moment is again directed along the axis of the section\nin the same sense. But now consider the portion of the shaft to either side of the\ncut section. To be consistent, their cross-sections will bulge out. This is clearly an\nincompatible state of deformation. On the other hand, if it dished-in, then we\nwould have a torque, the same torque producing two dramatically different effects.\n\nChapter 8\nThis argument also rules out a uniform extension or contraction of the cross-sec-\ntion.\nThus, no bulging-out, no dishing-in, radial lines remain radial - a cross-section\nrotates as a rigid plane.\nOne further fact follows from the uniformity of torque at each section, namely,\nthe relative rotation of two cross-sections is the same for any two sections sep\narated by the same distance along the axis of the shaft.\nIf we let φ be the rotation of any section, then this is equivalent to saying\ndφ/dz is a constant\nConsider now the strains due to\nthe rotation of one section relative\nto another.\nThe figure shows the rotation\nof a section located along the axis\nat z+∆ z relative to a section at z\njust below it. Of course the section\nat z has rotated too, most likely.\nBut it is the relative rotation of the\ntwo sections which gives rise to a\nstrain, a shear strain. γ, which\nmeasures the decrease in right\nangle, originally formed by two line segments, one circumferential, the other axi\nally directed as shown. From the geometry we can state:\nr\n∆φ\nφ\nz\n∆z\nz\nz +∆z\nγ\nγ(r)\n⁄\nγ = lim (r∆φ ∆z ) = rdφ\n∆z → 0\nz\nd\nNote that this relationship shows that the shear strain is a linear function of\nradius - zero at the axis, maximum at the shaft's outer radius. Note too that, with\ndφ/dz a constant, the shear strain does not vary with z with position along the axis\nof the shaft.\nThere are no other strains! With no deformation in plane and no bulging-out or\ndishing in, there are no other strains. If there existed some asymmetry like that of\nthe truss bay structure with one diagonal number removed from each bay, then we\nwould not be able to rule out a contraction (or extension) in the z direction.\n8.3\nConstitutive Relations\nBecause we have but one strain component, this will be a very short section.

For a shaft of\nlength L, the rotation of one end relative to the other is just the integral of the con\nstant rate of rotation over the length, that is, just the product of the two. We\nobtain then:\nMT\nGJ L\n⁄\n(\n) φ\n⋅\n=\nThis is our major result. Observe\n- We can obtain the shear stress and strain distribution in terms of the\napplied moment by substitution.

In\nparticular if we slit a hollow tube lengthwise we dramatically decrease the\ntorsional stiffness of the tube.\nIf we have a composite shaft of two concentric\nshafts, or more, the analysis will go through as fol\nlows:\nThe symmetry arguments still apply; the strain as\na function of radius remains linear and proportional\nto the rate of twist γ = rdφ/dz\nBut now our shear stress distribution is no longer\nthe same.

See, I got the\nsecond question wired. It goes like this: the torque is the same in both, right?\nAnd the radius of the shaft that's fixed to the wall is biggest and because the\nmaximum shear stress in a shaft is at the biggest radius, I just plug into the\nformula for shear stress and I've got it.\nKatie: I think you're wrong Reid, I think we should go slower, take things\nstep by step.\nReid: You're just jealous because you girls can't see things as quick as us\nguys.\nKatie: It appears that you're so quick you didn't even need to read the prob\nlem ..... it says right there that the maximum shear stress occurs in the\nsmaller diameter shaft!\nReid: Maybe the answer given is wrong. Stuff in these books are wrong lots\nof time. I mean look at that equation for shear stress\nτ\n= rM /J.\nT\nSee that little old radius there up top? Now when that r maxes out so does τ.\nKatie: But Reid, that little old J depends on r too. In fact, for a solid shaft it\ngoes as the fourth power to the radius so it predominates.\nReid: Predominates.... You're saying the smaller radius shaft has maximum\nshear stress for the same moment?\n\nChapter 8\nKatie: Hold on, hold on. The maximum shear stress depends upon the\nmoment in the shaft as well.. that \"little old\" MT right there. So we have got\nto first see which shaft carries the largest torque, and then...\nReid: But the torques are the same in both shafts!\nKatie: ...same in both shafts. Where do you get that from?\nReid: I dunno...conservation of torque, I guess...it just feels right.\nKatie: You men are all alike. What have feelings have to do with it? Watch\nme: I isolate the shaft carrying the torque MT, just like the author did with\nthat interesting historical example of a human powered, well-water lift.

So, Reid, you see how your feelings can lead you\nastray?\n****\nKatie is correct, as is the book. The torque in the shaft fixed to the wall is three\ntimes the torque carried by the free-ended shaft. Even so, because the shear stress\nis more sensitive to changes in the radius of a shaft than to torque, it is the smaller\nshaft that sees the largest shear stress. If both the shafts had the same radius, the\none fixed to the wall would indeed show the largest shear but that is not the case\nhere. I could make up another story about how, with less of a radius, the smaller\ncross-section must experience a greater stress at each and every position r in order\nto sum to the same moment.\nThe work follows:\nThe maximum stress in shaft #2 is τ2|max = r2M\n2/J2 which, with J=π r 4/2 gives\n\nStresses/Deflections Shafts in Torsion\nτ\n2|max = 39.2 MN/m 2\nwhile for shaft #1 we obtain τ |\n= 204 MN/m 2\n1 max\nThe torsional stiffness at the end where the movement is applied is obtained by\nsumming up the relative angular deflections of the two shafts being careful to\nassure compatibility of deformation at the section where the gears mesh. Working\nfrom the wall out, the angular rotation of the geared end of shaft #2 relative to its\n(fixed) end is\nφ 2(L2)= (M2L2)/(GJ2)\nNow, compatibility of deformation,\nno-slip at the gear teeth requires that\nφ\n2(L2)R = φ1(0)R\nwhere the directions of the angular rotations\nare indicated in the figure. So we have\nφ1(0)=(R /R1)(M2L2)/(GJ2)\nNow the relative rotation of the free\nφ2\nR2\nφ1\nR1\nφ2 R2 = φ1 R1\nend of the small shaft to which the\ntorque is applied is given by\nφ1(L1) - φ 1(0) =(M1L1)/(GJ1)\nSo\nφ1(L1) = (M1L1)/(GJ1) + (R /R1)(M2L2)/(GJ2)\nSubstituting for M1, M we can write\nφ\n1(L1)=(M1L1)/(GJ1)[1 + (R /R1)2(L /L1)(J /J2)]\nSo Kφ =(GJ /L1)/[1 + (R /R1)2(L /L1)(J /J2)]. which gives Kφ= 44.35 NM/radian\nObserve:\n- Although only numerical results were required to be verified, I worked\nthrough the problem symbolically refraining from plugging-in until the\nend. This is highly recommended practice for it allows me to keep a check\non my work by inspecting the dimensions of the results I obtain.\n- Note, too, how I can readily extend my results to other configurations\nchanging the relative length of the shafts, their radii, and the material out\nof which they are made.\n- The maximum shear stress is quite large relative to the yield stress of steel.\nWe shall see that yielding becomes a possibility when the maximum shear\nstress is one-half the yield strength in a tension test.\n\nChapter 8\n8.5\nTorsion of other than circular shafts\nWe have already stated how, if a shaft does not exhibit symmetry, our analysis of\ndeformation does not apply.

The figure\nat the right is a classic.\nThe distorted shape - note the warp\ning of the originally plane cross section -\nis due, in part, to the fact that the shear stresses at the corners must vanish.\nOther results say that the maximum shear stress occurs in the middle of the\nlongest side of length b.

      "content": "Stresses: Beams in Bending\nThe organization of this chapter mimics that of the last chapter on torsion of cir\ncular shafts but the story about stresses in beams is longer, covers more territory,\nand is a bit more complex. In torsion of a circular shaft, the action was all shear;\ncontiguous cross sections sheared over one another in their rotation about the axis\nof the shaft. Here, the major stresses induced due to bending are normal stresses\nof tension and compression. But the state of stress within the beam includes shear\nstresses due to the shear force in addition to the major normal stresses due to\nbending although the former are generally of smaller order when compared to the\nlatter. Still, in some contexts shear components of stress must be considered if\nfailure is to be avoided.\nOur study of the deflections of a shaft in torsion produced a relationship\nbetween the applied torque and the angular rotation of one end of the shaft about\nits longitudinal axis relative to the other end of the shaft. This had the form of a\nstiffness equation for a linear spring, or truss member loaded in tension, i.e.,\nMT = ( GJ ⁄ L)\n\nφ\n\n⋅\nis like\nF = ( AE\n\n⁄ L)\n\nδ\n\n⋅\nSimilarly, the rate of rotation of circular cross sections was a constant along\nthe shaft just as the rate of displacement if you like, ∂ u , the extensional strain\n∂ x\nwas constant along the truss member loaded solely at its ends.\nWe will construct a similar relationship between the moment and the radius of\ncurvature of the beam in bending as a step along the path to fixing the normal\nstress distribution. We must go further if we wish to determine the transverse dis\nplacement and slope of the beam's longitudinal axis. The deflected shape will gen\nerally vary as we move along the axis of the beam, and how it varies will depend\nupon how the loading is distributed over the span Note that we could have consid\nered a torque per unit length distributed over the shaft in torsion and made our life\nmore complex - the rate of rotation, the dφ /dz would then not be constant along\nthe shaft.\nIn subsequent chapters, we derive and solve a differential equation for the\ntransverse displacement as a function of position along the beam. Our exploration\nof the behavior of beams will include a look at how they might buckle. Buckling is\na mode of failure that can occur when member loads are well below the yield or\nfracture strength. Our prediction of critical buckling loads will again come from a\nstudy of the deflections of the beam, but now we must consider the possibility of\nrelatively large deflections.\n\nChapter 9\nIn this chapter we construct relations for the normal and shear stress compo\nnents at any point within the the beam's cross-section. To do so, to resolve the\nindeterminacy we confronted back in chapter 3, we must first consider the defor\nmation of the beam.\n9.1\nCompatibility of Deformation\nWe consider first the deformations and displacements of a beam in pure bending.\nPure bending is said to take place over a finite portion of a span when the\nbending moment is a constant over that portion. Alternatively, a portion of a\nbeam is said to be in a state of pure bending when the shear force over that portion\nis zero. The equivalence of these two statements is embodied in the differential\nequilibrium relationship\ndMb = -V\nx\nd\nUsing symmetry arguments, we will be able to construct a displacement field\nfrom which we deduce a compatible state of strain at every point within the beam.\nThe constitutive relations then give us a corresponding stress state. With this in\nhand we pick up where we left off in section 3.2 and relate the displacement field\nto the (constant) bending moment requiring that the stress distribution over a cross\nsection be equivalent to the bending moment. This produces a moment-curvature\nrelationship, a stiffness relationship which, when we move to the more general\ncase of varying bending moment, can be read as a differential equation for the\ntransverse displacement.\nP\nx\ny\nP\nP\nx\nV\nMb\nP\nV\ny\nP\nx\nMb\nPa\nbeam in pure bending, plane cross sections\nremain plane and perpendicular to the lon-\nx\nWe have already worked up a pure bending\nproblem; the four point bending of the simply\nsupported beam in an earlier chapter. Over the\nmidspan, L/4 < x < 3L/4, the bending moment\nis constant, the shear force is zero, the beam\nis in pure bending.\nWe cut out a section of the beam and consider\nhow it might deform. In this, we take it as\ngiven that we have a beam showing a cross\nsection symmetric with respect to the plane\ndefined by z=0 and whose shape does not\nchange as we move along the span. We will\nclaim, on the basis of symmetry that for a\n\nStresses: Beams in Bending\ngitudinal axis. For example, postulate that the cross section CD on the right does\nnot remain plane but bulges out.\nMb\nMb\nA\nB\nD\nC\nMb\nMb\nNow run around to the other side of the page and look at the section AB. The\nmoment looks the same so section AB too must bulge out. Now come back and\nconsider the portion of the beam to the right of section CD; its cross section too\nwould be bulged out. But then we could not put the section back without gaps\nalong the beam. This is an incompatible state of deformation.\nAny other deformation out of plane, for example, if the top half of the section\ndished in while the bottom half bulged out, can be shown to be incompatible with\nour requirement that the beam remain all together in one continuous piece. Plane\ncross sections must remain plane.\nThat cross sections remain perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the beam\nfollows again from symmetry - demanding that the same cause produces the same\neffect.\nMb\nMb\nMb\nMb\nMb\nMb\nA\nB\nD\nC\nThe two alternative deformation patterns shown above are equally plausible -\nthere is no reason why one should occur rather than the other. But rotating either\nabout the vertical axis shown by 180 degrees produces a contradiction. Hence they\nare both impossible. Plane cross sections remain perpendicular to the longitu\ndinal axis of the beam.\n\nChapter 9\nThe deformation pattern of a\ndifferential element of a beam in\npure bending below is the one that\nprevails.\nHere we show the plane cross\nsections remaining plane and per\npendicular to the longitudinal axis.\nWe show the longitudinal differen\ntial elements near the top of the\nbeam in compression, the ones\nx\nρ\nA'\n∆φ\nB'\n∆s\ny\n∆x\nA\nC\nD\nB\ny\nAfter\nBefore\nC'\nnear the bottom in tension - the\nanticipated effect of a positive\nbending moment Mb, the kind\nD'\nshown. We expect then that there\nis some longitudinal axis which is\nneither compressed nor extended,\nan axis1 which experiences no change in length. We call this particular longitudi\nnal axis the neutral axis. We have positioned our x,y reference coordinate frame\nwith the x axis coincident with this neutral axis.\nWe first define a radius of curvature of the deformed beam in pure bending.\nBecause plane cross sections remain plane and perpendicular to the longitudi\nnal axes of the beam, the latter deform into arcs of concentric circles. We let the\nradius of the circle taken up by the neutral axis be ρ and since the differential ele\nment of its length, BD has not changed, that is BD = B'D', we have\nρ ∆φ = ∆s = ∆x\n⋅\nwhere ∆φ is the angle subtended by the arc B'D', ∆s is a differential element along the\ndeformed arc, and ∆x, the corresponding differential length along the undeformed neutral\naxis. In the limit, as ∆x or ∆s goes to zero we have, what is strictly a matter of geometry\ndφ\n1 ρ\n⁄\n=\ns\nd\nwhere ρ is the radius of curvature of the neutral axis.\nNow we turn to the extension and contraction of a longitudinal differential line\nelement lying off the neutral axis, say the element AC. Its extensional strain is\ny\ndefined by\nε ( ) = lim (A' C' - AC ) ⁄ AC\nx\n∆s → 0\n1. We should say \"plane\", or better yet, \"surface\" rather than \"axis\" since the beam has a depth, into the page.\n\nStresses: Beams in Bending\nNow AC, the length of the differential line element in its undeformed state, is\nthe same as the length BD, namely AC = BD = ∆x = ∆s while its length in the\ndeformed state is A'C' = (ρ - y) ⋅∆φ\n\nwhere y is the vertical distance from the neutral axis.\nWe have then using the fact that ρ∆φ = ∆s\n(ρ - y) ⋅∆φ\n\n- ∆s\n⁄\nwe obtain\nε ( ) = lim\n----------------------------------------\n= lim -(y∆φ ∆s)\ny\nx\n∆s → 0\n∆s\n∆s → 0\nor, finally,\nεx y\n( )\ny\n-\ndφ\n\n⋅\ny ρ\n⁄\n(\n)\n-\n=\n=\ns\nd\nWe see that the strain varies linearly with y; the elements at the top of the beam\nare in compression, those below the neutral axis in extension. Again, this assumes\na positive bending moment M . It also assumes that there is no other cause that\nb\nmight engender an extension or contraction of longitudinal elements such as an\naxial force within the beam. If the latter were present, we would superimpose a\nuniform extension or contraction on each longitudinal element.\nThe extensional strain of the longitudinal elements of the beam is the most\nimportant strain component in pure bending. The shear strain γ\nwe have shown\nxy\nto be zero; right angles formed by the intersection of cross sectional planes with\nlongitudinal elements remain right angles. This too is an important result. Symme\ntry arguments can also be constructed to show that the shear strain component γ xz\nis zero for our span in pure bending, of uniform cross section which is symmetric\nwith respect to the plane defined by the locus of all points z=0.\nIn our discussion of strain-displacement\nrelationships, you will find a displacement\ny\nfield defined by u(x,y) = -κ xy; v(x,y)= κ x 2/2\n+1\nwhich yields a strain state consistent in most\nrespects with the above.\nIn our analysis of\npure bending we have not ruled out an exten-\n-1\nsional strain in the y direction which this dis-\n+1\nplacement field does. In the figure we show\nthe deformed configuration of, what we can\nnow interpret as, a short segment of span of the\n-1\nbeam.\nIf the κ is interpreted as the reciprocal of\nthe radius of curvature of the neutral axis, the\nexpression for the extensional strain ε derived in an earlier chapter is totally in\nx\nx\n\nChapter 9\naccord with what we have constructed here. κ is called the curvature while, again,\nρ is called the radius of curvature.\nSummarizing, we have, for pure bending -- the case when the bending moment\nis constant over the whole or some section of a beam -- that plane cross-sections\nremain plane and perpendicular to the neutral axis, (or surface), that the neutral\naxis deforms into the arc of a circle of radius of curvature, ρ, and longitudinal ele\nments experience an extensional strain ε where:\ndφ\n1 ρ\n⁄\n=\nand\nεx y\n( )\ny ρ\n⁄\n(\n)\n-\n=\ns\nd\n9.2\nConstitutive Relations\nThe stress-strain relations take the form\n(\nε\n= (1 ⁄ E) ⋅[σ - ν σy + σ )]\n0 = σ\n⁄ G\nx\nx\nz\nxy\n(\nε\n= (1 ⁄ E) ⋅[σy - ν σ + σ )]\n0 = σ\n⁄ G\ny\nx\nz\nxz\n(\nε\n= (1 ⁄ E) ⋅[σ - ν σ + σy)]\nγ\n= σ\n⁄ G\nz\nz\nx\nyz\nyz\nWe now assume that the stress components σ and σ\n(hence γyz), can be\nz\nyz\nneglected, taken as zero, arguing that for beams whose cross section dimensions\nare small relative to the length of the span2, these stresses can not build to any\nappreciable magnitude if they vanish on the surface of the beam. This is the ordi\nnary plane stress assumption.\nBut we also take σ ,to be insignificant, as zero. This is a bit harder to justify,\ny\nespecially for a beam carrying a distributed load. In the latter case, the stress at\nthe top, load-bearing surface cannot possibly be zero but must be proportional to\nthe load itself. On the other hand, on the surface below, (we assume the load is\ndistributed along the top of the beam), is stress free so σ , must vanish there. For\ny\nthe moment we make the assumption that it is negligible. When we are through we\nwill compare its possible magnitude to the magnitude of the other stress compo\nnents which exist within, and vary throughout the beam.\n2. Indeed, this may be taken as a geometric attribute of what we allow to be called a beam in the first place.\n\nStresses: Beams in Bending\nWith this, our stress-strain relations reduce to three equations for the normal\nstrain components in terms of the only significant stress component σ . The one\nx\ninvolving the extension and contraction of the longitudinal fibers may be written\nσx y\n( ) E εx\n⋅\ny\nE\nρ\n⁄\n(\n)\n⋅\n-\n=\n=\nThe other two may be taken as machinery to compute the extensional strains in\nthe y,z directions, once we have found σ .\nx\n9.3\nThe Moment/Curvature Relation\nThe figure below shows the stress component σ (y) distributed over the cross-sec-\nx\ntion. It is a linear distribution of the same form as that considered back in an ear\nlier chapter where we toyed with possible stress distributions which would be\nequivalent to a system of zero resultant force and a couple.\nBut now we know for sure, for compatible\ndeformation in pure bending, the exact form of\nhow the normal stress must vary over the\ncross section. According to derived expression\nfor the strain, εx, σx must be a linear distri\nbution in y.\nHow this normal stress due to bending var\nies with x, the position along the span of the\nbeam, depends upon how the curvature, 1/ρ,\nvaries as we move along the beam. For the\ncase of pure bending, out analysis of compatible deformations tells us that the cur\nvature is constant so that σ (x,y) does not vary with x and we can write σ (x,y) =\nx\nσ x(x,y) = - y E/ρ\ny\nx\nx\nσ (y), a (linear) function of y alone. This is what we would expect since the bend-\nx\ning moment is obtained by integration of the stress distribution over the cross sec\ntion: if the bending moment is constant with x, then σx should be too. We show\nthis in what follows.\nTo relate the bending moment to the curvature, and hence to the stress σx, we\nrepeat what we did in an earlier exploration of possible stress distributions within\nbeams, first determining the consequences of our requirement that the resultant\nforce in the axial direction be zero, i.e.,\nσ ⋅ A\nd\n= -(E ⁄ ρ) ⋅\ny ⋅ A\n\nd\n= 0\nso\n∫\nx\n∫\nArea\nArea\ny ⋅\nArea ∫\n=\nA\n\nd\nBut what does that tell us? It tells us that the neutral axis, the longitudinal\naxis that experiences no extension or contraction, passes through the centroid\n\nChapter 9\nof the cross section of the beam. Without this requirement we would be left float\ning in space, not knowing from whence to measure y. The centroid of the cross\nsection is indicated on the figure.\nThat this is so, that is, the requirement\nrequires that our reference axis pass through\nthe centroid of the cross section, follows from\nthe definition of the location of the centroid,\nnamely\ny ⋅ A\n\nd\n∫\nA\ny ≡ ----------------\nA\ny\ny\nIf y is measured relative to the axis passing thru\nthe centroid, then y is zero, our requirement is sat\nisfied.\nA1\nA2\nA3\ny1\ny2\ny3\n?\ny\nref.\nIf our cross section can be viewed as a com\nposite, made up of segments whose centroids\nare easily determined, then we can use the def\ninition of the centroid of a single area to\nobtain the location of the centroid of the com\nposite as follows.\nConsider a more general collection of segments whose centroid locations are\nknown relative to some reference: From the definition of the location of the cen\ntroid we can write\ny ⋅ dA 1 + ∫y ⋅ dA 2 + ∫y ⋅ dA 3\n∫\nA 1\nA 2\nA 3\ny 1 ⋅ A 1 + y 2 ⋅ A 2 + y 3 ⋅ A 3\ny = -----------------------------------------------------------------------------= -----------------------------------------------------------\nA 1 +\n+ A 3\nA\nA 2\nwhere A is the sum of the areas of the segments. We use this in an exercise, to wit:\nExercise 9.1\nDetermine the location of the neutral axis for the \"T\" cross-section shown.\nb1\nt\nh\nb2\nh/2\nh+t/2\ny\nA 1\nA 2\nA\n\n⋅\n⋅\n⋅\nStresses: Beams in Bending\nWe seek the centroid of the cross-section. Now, because the cross-section is\nsymmetric with respect to a vertical plane perpendicular to the page and bisecting\nthe top and the bottom rectangles, the centroid must lie in this plane or, since this\nplane appears as a line, it must lie along the vertical line, AA'. To find where\nalong this vertical line the centroid is located, we first set a reference axis for\nmeasuring vertical distances. This could be chosen anywhere; I choose to set it at\nthe base of the section.\nI let y be the distance from this reference to the centroid, yet unknown. From\nthe definition of the location of the centroid and its expression at the top of this\npage in terms of the centroids of the two segments, we have\n⋅\n+\ny\nA = (h ⁄ 2) ⋅A2 + (h\nt\n\n⁄ 2) ⋅A1\nwhere\nA = h ⋅b2 + t b1,\nA2 = h b2\nand\nA1 = t b1\nThis is readily solved for y given the dimensions of the cross-section; the cen\ntroid is indicated on the figure at the far right.\nTaking stock at this point, we see that, for the case of \"pure bending\", we have\nthat the normal strain and normal stress vary linearly over the cross-section. If we\nmeasure y from the centroid of the section we have\nσx y\n( ) E εx\n⋅\ny\nE\nρ\n⁄\n(\n)\n⋅\n-\n=\n=\nIn this case, the resultant force due to σ is zero.\nx\nThe resultant moment due to σx must equal the bending moment. In fact, we\nhave:\n-Mb = ∫y ⋅[σx A\nd ]\nArea\nThis relationship ties the bending moment to the curvature.\nWithin the integrand, the term within the brackets is a differential element of force due to\nthe stress distributed over the differential element of area b(y)dy. The negative sign in front\nof Mb is necessary because, if σ were positive at y positive, on a positive x face, then the\nx\ndifferential element of force σ dA would produce a moment about the negative z axis,\nx\nwhich, according to our convention for bending moment, would be a negative bending\nmoment. Now substituting our known linear distribution for the stress σ , we obtain\nx\nMb = (E ⁄ ρ) ⋅∫y 2 ⋅\nA\nd\nArea\nThe integral is again just a function of the geometry of the cross section. It is\noften called the moment of inertia about the z axis. We will label it I.

We have answered the question he originally\nposed. While we have done so strictly only for the case of \"pure bending\", this is\nno serious limitation. In fact, we take the above relationships to be accurate\n3. Often subscripts are added to I, e.g., I\nor I ; both are equally acceptable and/or confusing.

That is, we need a parallel axis\ntheorem for evaluating the moment of inertia\nof a cross-section.\nA1\nA2\nA3\nd1\nd2\nd3\nWe use the same composite section as above and seek the total moment of\ninertia of all segments with respect to the centroid of the composite. We first\nwrite I as the sum of the I's\n∫\n∫\nI = ∫ y 2 ⋅ A\nd\n=\ny ⋅ dA1 +\ny 2 ⋅ dA2 +\ny ⋅ dA3\n∫\nArea\nA1\nA2\nA3\nthen, for each segment, express y in terms of d and a local variable of integration, η\nThat is, we let y = d1 + η1 etc. and so obtain;\n∫\nI = ∫(d1 + η1 )2 ⋅ dA1 + etc.=\n(d1\n2 + 2d1η1 + η1 ) ⋅ dA1\nA1\nA1\n= d1 A1 +\n2d1η1 ⋅ dA1 +\nη1\n2 ⋅ dA1 + etc.\n∫\n∫\nA1\nA1\nNow\nthe\nmiddle\nterm\nin\nthe\nsum\non\nthe\nright\nvanishes\nsince\n2d1η1 ⋅ dA1 = 2d1 η1 ⋅ dA1 and η1 is measured from the local centroid. Fur-\n∫\n∫\nA1\nA1\nthermore, the last term in the sum on the right is just the local moment of inertia.\nThe end result is the parallel axis theorem (employed three times as indicated by\nthe \"etc\".)\nI = d1\n2 A1 + I1\n+ etc.\nThe bottom line is this: Knowing the local moment of inertia (with respect to\nthe centroid of a segment) we can find the moment of inertia with respect to any\naxis parallel to that passing through the centroid of the segment by adding a term\nequal to the product of the area and the square of the distance from the centroid to\nthe arbitrarily located, parallel axis. Note that the moment of inertia is a mini\nmum when taken with respect to the centroid of the segment.\n\nChapter 9\nExercise 9.2\nThe uniformly loaded \"I\" beam is simply supported at its left end and at a\ndistance L/5 in from its right end.\nConstruct the shear-force and bending-moment diagrams, noting in partic\nular the location of the maximum bending moment. Then develop an esti\nmate of the maximum stress due to bending.\nwo = Force per unit length\nRB\n4/5 L\nt\nt\nb\nh\nL\nRA\nAn isolation of the entire span and requiring equilibrium gives the two vertical\nreactions,\n⁄\n⁄\nRA = (3 8)w L\nand\nRB = (5 8)w L\no\no\nA section of the beam cut between the two sup-\ny\nV\nMb\nports will enable the evaluation of the shear force\ny\nx\nand bending moment within this region. We have\nwo\nindicated our positive sign convention as the\nV\nusual. Force equilibrium gives the shear force\nV x\n⁄\n+\n( ) = -(3 8)w L\nw x\no\no\nMb\nwhich, we note, passes through zero at x = (3/8)L and,\nas we approach the right support, approaches the\nx\nvalue (17/40)w L. At this point, the shear force suffers\no\nRA = (3woL/8)\na discontinuity, a jump equal in magnitude to the reac\ntion at B.\nIts value just to the right of the right sup\nport is then -(1/5)w L. Finally, it moves to zero at the end of the beam at the same rate, w0,\no\nas required by the differential equilibrium relation\ndV = wo\nx\nd\nWe could, if we wish, at this point use the same free body diagram above to\nobtain an expression for the bending moment distribution. I will not do this.\nRather I will construct the bending moment distribution using insights gained\nfrom evaluating Mb at certain critical points and reading out the implications of\nthe other differential, equilibrium relationship,\ndMb = -V x\n( )\nx\nd\n\nStresses: Beams in Bending\nOne interesting point is at the left end of the beam. Here the bending moment\nmust be zero since the roller will not support a couple. Another critical point is at\nx=(3/8)L where the shear force passes through zero. Here the slope of the bending\nmoment must vanish. We can also infer from this differential, equilibrium rela\ntionship that the slope of the bending moment distribution is positive to the left of\nthis point, negative to the right. Hence at this point the bending moment shows a\nlocal maximum. We cannot claim that it is the maximum over the whole span until\nwe check all boundary points and points of shear discontinuity.\nFurthermore, since the shear\nx\nwo\n4/5 L\nh\ny\nforce is a linear function of x, the\nbending moment must be quadratic\nin this region, symmetric about\nt\nx=(3/8)L. Now since the distance\nfrom the locus of the local maxi\nmum to the roller support at the\nt\nright is greater than the distance to\nthe left end, the bending moment\nwill diminish to less than zero at\nRB = 5woL/8\nthe right support. We can evaluate RA = 3woL/8\nits magnitude by constructing an\nisolation that includes the portion\nof the beam to the right of the sup\nport.\nWe find, in this way that, at\nx=4L/5, M = - w L2/50.\nb\no\nAt the right support there is a\nV (x)\n-woL/5\n7woL/40\nx\n- 3woL/8\ndiscontinuity in the slope of the\nbending moment equal to the dis\ncontinuity in the value of the shear\nforce. The jump is just equal to the\nreaction force RB. In fact the slope\nof the bending moment must switch\nfrom negative to positive at this\npoint because the shear force has\nchanged sign. The character of the\nbending moment distribution from the right support point out to the right end of\nthe beam is fully revealed noting that, first, the bending moment must go to zero at\nthe right end, and, second, that since the shear force goes to zero there, so must\nthe slope of the bending moment.\nMb(x)\nMb|max = 9woL/128\n3L/8\nx\nAll of this enables sketching the shear force and bending moment distributions\nshown. We can now state definitively that the maximum bending moment occurs\nat x= 3L/8. Its value is Mb\n= (9 ⁄ 128)w L\no\nmax\n\nChapter 9\nThe maximum stress due to this maximum bending moment is obtained from\ny\nMb\n⋅(\n)\nmax\nσ\n= -----------------------------\nx max\nI\nIt will occur at the top and bottom of the beam where y = ± h/2, measured from\nthe neutral, centroidal axis, attains its maximum magnitude. At the top, the stress\nwill be compressive while at the bottom it will be tensile since the maximum\nbending moment is a positive quantity.\nWe must still evaluate the moment of inertia I. Here we will estimate this\nquantity assuming that t < h, and/or b, that is, the web of the I beam is thin, or has\nnegligible area relative to the flanges at the top and bottom. Our estimate is then\nI ≈2 ⋅[(h ⁄ 2)2 ] ⋅[t b]\n⋅\nThe last bracketed factor is the area of one flange. The first bracketed factor is\nthe square of the distance from the y origin on the neutral axis to the centroid of\nthe flange, or an estimate thereof. The factor of two out front is there because the\ntwo flanges contribute equally to the moment of inertia. How good an estimate\nthis is remains to be tested. With all of this, our estimate of the maximum stress\ndue to bending is\nL2\nwo\nσ\n≈(9 ⁄ 128) ⋅ ------------\nx max\n(thb)\n9.4\nShear Stresses in Beams\nIn this last exercise we went right ahead and used an equation for the normal\nstress due to bending constructed on the assumption of a particular kind of load\ning, namely, pure bending, a loading which produces no shear force within the\nbeam. Clearly we are not justified in this assumption when a distributed load acts\nover the span. No problem. The effect of the shear force on the normal stress dis\ntribution we have obtained is negligible. Furthermore, the effect of a shear force\non the deflection of the beam is also small. All of this can be shown to be accurate\nenough for most engineering work, at least for a true beam, that is when its length\nis much greater than any of its cross-section's dimensions.We will first show that\nthe shear stresses due to a shear force are small with respect to the normal stresses\ndue to bending.\nReconsider Galileo's end loaded, can-\nx\nP\nx = L\nA\nh\nb\nσ xy(y)=?\ny\nV=P\ntilever beam. At any section, x, a shear\nforce, equal to the end load, which we\nnow call P, acts in accord with the\nrequirement of static equilibrium. I have\nshown the end load as acting up. The shear\nforce is then a positive quantity according to\nour convention.\n\nStresses: Beams in Bending\nWe postulate that this shear force is distributed over the plane cross section at x\nin the form of a shear stress σ . Of course there is a normal stress σ distributed\nxy\nx\nover this section too, with a resultant moment equal to the bending moment at the\nsection. But we do not show that on our picture just yet.\nWhat can we say about the shear stress distribution σ (y)? For starters we can\nxy\nclaim that it is only a function of y, not of z as we have indicated (nor of x in this\ncase since V(x) is constant). The truth of this claim depends upon the shape of the\ncontour of the cross-section as we shall see. For a rectangular cross section it's a\nvalid claim.\nWe can also claim with more assurance that the shear stress must vanish at the\ntop and bottom of the beam because we know from chapter 4 that at every point\nwe have σ\n= σ ; but at the top and bottom surfaces σ\nvanishes (there is no\nxy\nyx\nyx\napplied force in the horizontal direction) so σ must vanish at y=± h/2.\nxy\nWe expect the shear stress to grow continuously to some finite value at some\npoint in the interior. We expect, for a continuous, homogeneous material, that it\nwill vary smoothly with y. Its maximum value, if this is the case, ought not to be\ntoo different from its mean value defined by\nV\nP\nσ\n≈ ---- = ----------\nxy mean\nA\n(bh)\nNow compare this with the maximum of the normal stress due to bending.\nRecalling that the maximum bending moment is PL at x=0, at the wall, and using\nour equation for pure bending, we find that\nMb ⋅ y\nPL h ⁄ 2)\n(\nσ\n= -------------- = ---------------------\nx max\nI\nI\nI now evaluate the moment of inertia of the cross-section, I have\n∫\nI = ∫ y 2 ⋅ A\nd\n=\ny ⋅ A\nd\nArea\n-h ⁄ 2\nThis yields, with careful attention to the limits of integration,\nbh3\nI = -------\nwhich is one of the few equations worth memorizing in this course.4\nThe maximum normal stress due to bending is then\nPL\n= 6-------------\nσx max\n(bh2 )\n4. Most practitioners say this as \"bee h cubed over twelve\". Like \"sigma is equal to em y over eye\" it has a cer\ntain ring to it.\n\nChapter 9\nWe observe:\n- The units check; the right hand side has dimensions of stress, F/L2. This is\ntrue also for our expression for the average shear stress.\n- The ratio of the maximum shear stress to the maximum normal stress due\nto bending is on the order of\nσ\n⁄ σ\n= Order (h/L)\nxy\nx\nmax\nmax\nwhich if the beam is truly a beam, is on the order of 0.1 or 0.01 -- as Gali\nleo anticipated!\n- While the shear stress is small relative to the normal stress due to bending,\nit does not necessarily follow that we can neglect it even when the ratio of\na dimension of the cross section to the length is small. In particular, in\nbuilt up, or composite beams excessive shear can be a cause for failure.\nσ yx(b∆x)\nσ x (x+∆x,y)dAy\nAy\nσ x (x+∆x,y)dAy\nAy\ny\nP\nx\nb\n∆x\nWe next develop a more\naccurate, more detailed, pic\nture of the shear stress dis\ntribution making use of an\ningeneous\nfree-body\ndia\ngram.

Composite materi\nals or forms include such heavy handed stuff as concrete (one material) reinforced\nwith steel bars (another material); high-tech developments such as tubes built up\nof graphite fibers embedded in an epoxy matrix; sports structures like laminated\nskis, the poles for vaulting, even a golf ball can be viewed as a filament wound\nstructure encased within another material. Honeycomb is another example of a\ncomposite - a core material, generally light-weight and relatively flimsy, main\ntains the distance between two face sheets, which are relatively sturdy with\nrespect to in-plane extension and contraction.\n\nChapter 9\nTo determine the moment/curvature relation, the normal stresses due to bend\ning, and the shear stresses within a composite beam, we proceed through the pure\nbending analysis all over again, making careful note of when we must alter our\nconstructions due to the inhomogeneity of the material.\nCompatibility of Deformation\nOur analysis of deformation of a\nbeam in pure bending included no\nreference to the material properties\nMaterial #2\ny\nor how they varied throughout the\nMaterial #1\nbeam. We did insist that the cross-\nsection be symmetric with respect to\nthe z=0 plane and that the beam be\nz\nuniform, that is, no variation of\ngeometry or properties as we move in\nx\nthe longitudinal direction. A com\nposite structure of the kind shown\nbelow would satisfy these conditions.\nConstitutive Relations\nWe have two materials so we must necessarily contend with two sets of mate\nrial properties. We still retain the assumptions regarding the smallness of the\nstress components σ , σ and τ\nin writing out the relations for each material. For\ny\nz\nyz\nmaterial #1 we have σ\n= -E1 ⋅(y ⁄ ρ) while for material #2 σ\n= -E2 ⋅(y ⁄ ρ)\nx\nx\nEquilibrium\nEquivalence of this normal stress distribution sketched\nbelow to zero resultant force and a couple equal to the bend-\n#1\n#2\nx\ny\nσx(y)\ning moment at any station along the span proceeds as fol\nlows:\nFor zero resultant force we must have\n∫σx ⋅ dA1 + ∫σx ⋅ dA2 = 0\nArea1\nArea2\nUpon substituting our strain-compatible variation of stress as a function of y\ninto this we obtain, noting that the radius of curvature, ρ is a common factor,\nE1\ny ⋅ dA1 + E2\ny ⋅ dA2 = 0\n∫\n∫\nArea1\nArea2\n\nStresses: Beams in Bending\nWhat does this mean? Think of it as a machine for\nh\nh\nE1\nE2\ncomputing the location of the unstrained, neutral\nh/2\nh/2\naxis, y = 0. However, in this case it is located, not at\nthe centroid of the cross-sectional area, but at the\ncentroid of area weighted by the elastic moduli. The\nmeaning of this is best exposed via a short thought\nexperiment. Turn the composite section over on its\nside. For ease of visualization of the special effect I\nwant to induce I consider a composite cross section\nof two rectangular subsections of equal area as shown below. Now think of the\nelastic modulus as a weight density, and assume E > E2, say E = 4 E .\ndE\nThis last equation is then synonymous with the requirement that the location of\nthe neutral axis is at the center of gravity of the elastic-modulus-as-weight-density\nconfiguration shown.5 Taking moments about the left end of the tipped over cross\nsection we must have\n[AE1 + AE2 ] ⋅ dE = (AE1 ) ⋅(h ⁄ 2) + (AE2 ) ⋅(3h ⁄ 2)\n⁄\nWith E\n= 4 E2 this gives dE = (7 10\n) ⋅ h for the location of the E-weighted\ncentroid\nNote that if the elastic moduli were the same the centroid would be at h, at the\nmid point. On the other hand, if the elastic modulus of material #2 were greater\nthan that of material #1 the centroid would shift to the right of the interface\nbetween the two.\nNow that we have a way to locate our neutral axis, we can proceed to develop a\nmoment curvature relationship for the composite beam in pure bending. We\nrequire for equivalence\n-Mb = ∫ y ⋅σx A\nd\nMb\ny\nArea\nas before, but now, when we replace σ with its variation\nx\nwith y we must distinguish between integrations over the\ntwo material, cross-sectional areas. We have then, breaking\nup the area integrals into A over one material's cross sec\ntion and A , the other material's cross section6\n∫\nMb = (E1 ⁄ ρ) ⋅\ny 2 ⋅ dA1 + (E2 ⁄ ρ) ⋅\ny ⋅ dA2\n∫\nA1\nA2\n5. I have assumed in this sketch that material #1 is stiffer, its elastic modulus E1 is greater than material #2 with\nelastic modulus E .2\n6. Note that we can have the area of either one or both of the materials distributed in any manner over the cross\nsection in several non-contiguous pieces. Steel reinforced concrete is a good example of this situation. We\nstill, however, insist upon symmetry of the cross section with respect to the x-y plane.\nx\n\nChapter 9\nThe integrals again are just functions of the geometry. I designate them I and I2 respec\ntively and write\nEI\nMb ⁄ [E1 I1 + E2 I2 ] = 1 ⁄ ρ\nor\nMb ⁄ (\n) = 1 ⁄ ρ\nHere then is our moment curvature relationship for pure bending of a compos\nite beam. It looks just like our result for a homogeneous beam but note\n- Plane cross sections remain plane and perpendicular to the longitudinal\naxis of the beam. Compatibility of Deformation requires this as before.\n- The neutral axis is located not at the centroid of area but at the centroid of\nthe E-weighted area of the cross section. In computing the moments of\ninertia I1, I2 the integrations must use y measured from this point.\n- The stress distribution is linear within each material but there exists a dis\ncontinuity at the interface of different materials. The exercise below illus\ntrates this result. Where the maximum normal stress appears within the\ncross section depends upon the relative stiffnesses of the materials as well\nas upon the geometry of the cross section.\nWe will apply the results above to loadings other than pure bending, just as we\ndid with the homogeneous beam. We again make the claim that the effect of shear\nupon the magnitude of the normal stresses and upon the deflected shape is small\nalthough here we are skating on thinner ice - still safe for the most part but thin\nner. And we will again work up a method for estimating the shear stresses them\nselves. The following exercise illustrates:\nExercise 9.3\nA composite beam is made of a solid polyurethane core and aluminum face\nsheets. The modulus of elasticity, E for the polyurethane is 1/30 that of alu\nminum. The beam, of the usual length L, is simply supported at its ends and\nh\nt\nt\nb\nfoam\nx\ncarries a concentrated load P at midspan. If the ratio of the thickness of the\naluminum face sheets to the thickness of the core is t/h = 1/20 develop an\nestimate for the maximum shear stress acting at the interface of the two\nmaterials.\n\nChapter 9\nP\nWe first sketch the shear force and bending\nmoment diagram, noting that the maximum\nbending moment occurs at mid span while the\nmaximum shear force occurs at the ends.\nP/2\nWatch this next totally unmotivated step. I am\nP/2\ngoing to move to estimate the shear stress at\nV\nMb\nthe interface of the aluminum and the core. I\nshow an isolation of a differential element of\nthe aluminum face sheet alone. I show the\nx\nnormal stress due to bending and how it varies\nboth over the thickness of the aluminum and\nas we move from x to x+∆x. I also show a dif\nferential element of a shear force ∆Fyx acting\non the underside of the differential element of\nthe aluminum face sheet. I do not show the\nshear stresses acting of the x faces; their\nresultant on the x face is in equilibrium with\ntheir resultant on the face x + ∆x.\nσx + ∆σ\nσx\nb∆x\nEquilibrium in the x direction will be sat\nisfied if\nx\n∆x\n∆F\n= ∫∆σxdAal\nyx\n∆Fyx\nAal\nwhere A\nis the cross-sectional area of the alumi-\ny\nal\nnum face sheet. Addressing the left hand side, we\nset\n∆F\n= σ b∆x\nyx\nyx\nwhere σ\nis the shear stress at the interface, the\nyx\nquantity we seek to estimate. Addressing the right\nhand side, we develop an expression for ∆σ\nfoam\nb\nx\nusing our pure bending result. From the moment curvature relationship for a composite\nEI\ncross section we can write Mb ⁄ (\n) = 1 ⁄ ρ\nThe stress distribution within the aluminum face sheet is then7\nEI\nσ\n= -Eal ⋅y ⁄ ρ\nwhich is then\nσ\n= -Eal ⋅yMb ⁄ (\n)\nx\nx\n7. Note the similarity to our results for the torsion of a composite shaft.\nx\n\nChapter 9\nTaking a differential view, as we move a small distance ∆ x and noting that the only thing\nthat varies with x is Mb, the bending moment, we have\n∆σ = - [ Eal y Mb / (EI)]]∆Mb(x)\nBut the change in the bending moment is related to the shear force through dif\nferential equation of equilibrium which can be written ∆ Mb = - V(x)∆ x. Putting\nthis all together we can write\n\n( ) ⋅ -----------d\nσyx ⋅ b∆x =\n\nEal ⋅ V x\ny\nAal ⋅∆x\nEI\n∫\n(\n)\n\nAal\nEal(V b)\n⁄\nor, in the limit\nσ\n= ----------------------- ∫y ⋅ dAal\nyx\nEI\nAal\nThis provides an estimate for the shear stress at the interface. Observe:\n- This expression needs elaboration. It is essential that you read the phrase\n∫Aal ydA correctly. First, y is to be measured from the E-weighted centroid\nof the cross section (which in this particular problem is at the center of the\ncross section because the aluminum face sheets are symmetrically dis\nposed at the top and the bottom of the cross section and they are of equal\narea). Second, the integration is to be performed over the aluminum cross\nsection only. More specifically, from the coordinate y= h/2, where one is\nestimating the shear stress up to the top of the beam, y = h/2 +t. This first\nmoment of area may be approximated by\n(\ny ⋅ dAal = bt h ⁄ 2)\n∫\nAal\n- The shear stress is dependent upon the change in the normal stress compo\nnent σ with respect to x. This resonates with our derivation, back in chap-\nx\nter 3, of the differential equations which ensure equilibrium of a\ndifferential element.\n- The equivalent EI can be evaluated noting the relative magnitudes of the\nelastic moduli and approximating the moment of inertia of the face sheets\nas Ial = 2(bt)(h/2)2 while for the foam we have I = bh3/12. This gives\nf\n⁄\nEI = (5 9)(Eal ⋅ bth2 )\nNote the consistent units; FL2 on both sides of the equation. The foam con\ntributes 1/9th to the equivalent bending stiffness.\n- The magnitude of the shear stress at the interface is then found to be, with\nV taken as P/2 and the first moment of area estimated above,\nσ\n⁄\nP\n= (9 10\n) ⋅ -----\nyx interface\nbh\n\nChapter 9\n- The maximum normal stress due to bending will occur in the aluminum8.\nIts value is approximately\n⁄\nP\nL\nσ\n= (9 2) ⋅ ------ ⋅ --\nx max\nbh\nh\nwhich, we note again is on the order of L/h times the shear stress at the inter\nface.\nAs a further example, we con-\ny\nsider a steel-reinforced concrete\nb\nσc\nbeam which, for simplicity, we take\nas a rectangular section.\nWe assume that the beam will be\nloaded with a positive bending\nmoment so that the bottom of the\nbeam will be in tension and the top\nin compression.\nWe reinforce the bottom with\nsteel rods. They will carry the ten\nsile load. We further assume that the concrete is unable to support any tensile\nload. So the concrete is only effective in compression, over the area of the cross\nsection above the neutral axis.\nσs\nMb\nd\nTotal area = n*As\nβh\nh\nneutral axis\nIn proceeding, we identify the steel material with material #1 and the concrete\nwith material #2 in our general derivation. We will write\nE1 = E = 30e06 psi\nand\nE2 = E = 3.6e06 psi\ns\ns\nThe requirement that the resultant force, due to the tensile stress in the steel\nand the compressive stress in the concrete, vanish then may be written\n∫σs ⋅ dAs + ∫σ ⋅ dA\n= 0\nor\n∫-Es ⋅(y ⁄ ρ) ⋅ dAs + ∫-E ⋅(y ⁄ ρ) ⋅ dA\n= 0\nc\nc\nc\nc\nA\nA\nA\nA\ns\nc\ns\nc\nwhich since the radius of curvature of the neutral axis is a constant relative to the integra\ntion over the area, can be written:\nEs ∫y ⋅ dA + Ec ∫y ⋅ dA\n= 0\ns\nc\nA\nA\ns\nc\nThe first integral, assuming that all the steel is concentrated at a distance (d -\nβh) below the neutral axis, is just\n-E (d - βh)nA\ns\ns\nwhere the number of reinforcing rods, each of area As, is n. The negative sign reflects the\nfact that the steel lies below the neutral axis.\n8. The aluminum is stiffer; for comparable extensions, as compatibility of deformation requires, the aluminum\nwill then carry a greater load. But note, the foam may fail at a much lower stress. A separation due to shear at\nthe interface is a possibility too.\n\nChapter 9\nThe second integral is just the product of the distance to the centroid of the\narea under compression, (h-d)/2 , the area b(h-d), and the elastic modulus.\n(h\nd)\n(\n-\nE ⋅----------------- ⋅b h - d)\nc\nThe zero resultant force requirement then yields a quadratic equation for d, or\nd/h, putting it in nondimensional form.

All we need do is express the\ncurvature of the deformed neutral\naxis in terms of the transverse dis\nplacement. This is a straight for\nward application of the classical\ncalculus as you have seen perhaps\nbut may also have forgotten. That's\nok. For it indeed can be shown\nthat1:\nx\nv(x)\nφ ~ dv/dx\nρ\nv(x)\ns\nd v\ndφ\ndx 2\n= ------------------------------3\ns\nd\n--\ndv 2\n1 +\n\nx\nd\n1. Note in this exact relationship, the independent variable is s, the distance along the curved, deformed neutral,\nx axis.\n\n---------_---__--\nChapter 10\nThere now we have it - once given the bending moment as a function of x all\nwe need do is solve this non-linear, second order, ordinary differential equation\nfor the transverse displacement v(x).\nBut hold on. When was the last time you solved a second order, non linear dif\nferential equation? Leonhard Euler attacked and resolved this one for some quite\nsophisticated end-loading conditions back in the eighteenth century but we can get\naway more cheaply by making our usual assumption of small displacement and\nrotations.\ndv 2\nThat is we take\n< 1 which says that the slope of the deflection is small\n\nx\nd\nwith respect to 1.0. Or equivalently that the rotation of the cross section as mea\nsured by φ ≈(dv/dx) is less than 1.0, one radian. In this we note the dimensionless\ncharacter of the slope. Our moment curvature equation can then be written more\nsimply as\nx 2\nd\nd v\nMb x\n( )\nEI -\n=\nExercise 10.1\nShow that, for the end loaded beam, of length L, simply supported at the left\nend and at a point L/4 out from there, the tip deflection under the load P is\nPL3\ngiven by\n∆= (3 16\n) ⋅--------\n⁄\nEI\nP\nA\nB\nC\nL/4\nL\nThe first thing we must do is determine the bending moment distribution as a\nfunction of x. No problem. The system is statically determinate. We first deter\nmine the reactions at A and B from an isolation of the whole. We find R\n= 3 P,\nA\ndirected down, and RB = 4P directed up.\n____\n\nDeflections due to Bending\nAn isolation of a portion to\nP\nthe right of the support at B\nRA = P (L - a)/a\nlooks very much like Galileo's\ncantilever. In this region we find\nB\na constant shear force equal in\nmagnitude to the end load and a\na\nL\nlinearly\nvarying\nbending\nmoment which, at x=L/4 is equal\nRB = P L/a\nto -(3/4)PL.\nV(x)\nWe note that the shear between x= 0\nP (L - a)/a\nand x < L/4 equals R , the reaction\nA\nat the left end, and that the bending\nmoment must return to zero. The\nx\ndiscontinuity in the shear force at B\nallows the discontinuity in slope of\n- P\nMb at that point.\nOur linear, ordinary, second\nMb(x)\norder differential equation for\nthe deflection of the neutral axis\nbecomes, for x < L/4\nx\n- P(L-a)\nx > a\nx\nd v\nMb( )\n3P\nx < a\ndx 2 = --------------- = -------- ⋅x\nMb = -Px (L/a -1)\nMb= - P(L-x)\nEI\nEI\nIntegrating this is straight forward. I must be careful, though, not to neglect to\nintroduce a constant of integration. I obtain\n3P\ndv = - ------- ⋅(x 2 ⁄ 2) + C1\nx\nd\nEI\nThis is the slope of the deflected neutral axis as a function of x, at least within\nthe domain 0<x<L/4. Integrating once more produces an expression for the dis\nplacement of the neutral axis and, again, a constant of integration.\n3P\nv x\n( ) = - ------- ⋅(x 3 ⁄ 6) + C1 ⋅x + C2\nEI\nHere then is an expression for the deflected shape of the beam in the domain\nleft of the support at B. But what are the constants of integration? We determine\nthe constants of integration by evaluating our expression for displacement v(x)\nand/or our expression for the slope dv/dx at points where we are sure of their val\nues. One such boundary condition is that, at x=0 the displacement is zero, i.e.,\nv x\n( )\n= 0\nx\n=\nAnother is that, at the support point B, the displacement must vanish, i.e.,\nv x\n( )\n= 0\nx = L ⁄ 4\n\nChapter 10\nPL2\nThese yield\nC2 = 0\nand\nC1 = -----------------\nand we can write, for x < L/4\n(32EI)\nP\nv x\n( ) = ---------- ⋅(x 3 - x ⁄ 16)\n2EI\nSo far so good. We have pinned down the displacement field for the region left\nof the support point at B. Now for the domain L/4 < x < L .\nThe linear, ordinary, second order differential equation for the deflection,\nagain obtained from the moment/curvature relation for small deflections and rota\ntions, becomes\nd v\nP\n-\n= ------- ⋅(L\nx)\nEI\ndx 2\nIntegrating this twice we obtain, first an expression for the slope, then another\nfor the displacement of the neutral axis. To wit:\ndv\nP\n= ------- ⋅(Lx - x 2 ⁄ 2) + D1\nx\nd\nEI\nand\nP\nv x\n( ) = ------- ⋅[Lx2 ⁄ 2 - x ⁄ 6] + D1 ⋅x + D2\nEI\nNow for some boundary conditions: It appears at first look that we have but\none condition, namely, at the support point B, the displacement must vanish. Yet\nwe have two constants of integration to evaluate!\nThe key to resolving our predicament is revealed by the form of the equation\nfor the slope; we need to fix the slope at some point in order to evaluate D . We do\nthis by insisting that the slope of the beam is continuous as we pass over the sup\nport point B. That is, the two slopes, that of v(x) evaluated at the left of B must\nequal that of v(x) evaluated just to the right of B. Our boundary conditions are\nthen, for x > L/4:\ndv\nPL2\nv x\n( )\n= 0\nand\n\n= ------------\nx\nd\nx = L ⁄ 4\n\nx = L ⁄ 4\n16EI\nwhere the right hand side of this last equation has been obtained by evaluating the slope to\nthe left of B at that support point. Sparing you the details, which you are encouraged to\nplough through at your leisure, I - and I hope you - obtain\nPL2\nPL3\n⁄\n⁄\nD1 = (5 32\n) ⋅---------\nand\nD2 = -(1 96\n) ⋅--------\nEI\nEI\n\nDeflections due to Bending\nSo, for L/4 < x < L we can write:\nv x\nPL3\n⁄\n⁄\n⁄\n( ) = -------------⋅[1 - 15\n\n(x L) + 48(x L) - 16(x L)3 ]\n96EI\nSetting x=L we obtain for the tip deflection:\nPL3\nv L\n⁄\n( ) = -(3 16\n) ⋅--------\nEI\nwhere the negative sign indicates that the tip deflects downward with the load directed\ndownward as shown.\nThe process and the results obtained above prompt the following observations:\n- The results are dimensionally correct. The factor PL3/(EI) has the dimen-\nsions of length, that is FL3/[(F/L2)L4] = L.\n- We can speak of an equivalent stiffness under the load and write\nEI\nP = K∆\nwhere\nK = (16 ⁄ 3) ⋅-----\nL3\nE.g., an aluminum bar with a circular cross section of radius 1.0in, and\nlength 3.0 ft. would have, with I = π r /4 = 0.785 in4, and E = 10x106 psi,\nan equivalent stiffness of K=898 lb/inch. If it were but one foot in\nlength, this value would be increased by a factor of nine.\n- This last speaks to the sensitivity of stiffness to length: We say \"the stiff-\nness goes as the inverse of the length cubed\". But then, the stiffness is\neven more sensitive to the radius of the shaft: \"it goes as the radius to the\nfourth power\". Finally note that changing materials from aluminum to\nsteel will increase the stiffness by a factor of three - the ratio of the E's.\n- The process was lengthy. One has to carefully establish an appropriate set\nof boundary conditions and be meticulous in algebraic manipulations2. It's\nnot the differential equation that makes finding the displacement function\nso tedious; it's, as you can see, the discontinuity in the loading, reflected in\nthe necessity of writing out a different expression for the bending moment\nover different domains, and the matching of solutions at the boundaries of\nthese regions that makes life difficult.\nFortunately, others have labored for a century or two cranking out solutions to\nthis quite ordinary differential equation. There are reference books that provide\nfull coverage of these and other useful formulae for beam deflections and many\nother things. One of the classical works in this regard is Roark and Young, FOR\nMULAS FOR STRESS AND STRAIN, 5th Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1975. We sum\nmarize selected results as follow.\n2. It took me three passes through the problem to get it right.\n\nChapter 10\nEnd-loaded Cantilever\nv(x)\nL\nv(x)\nP\nFor 0<x<L\nv(x) = [ PL3/(6EI)][3(x/L)2-(x/L)3]\nv|\n= PL3/(3EI)\nat x=L\nmax\nCouple, End-loaded Cantilever\nv(x)\nFor 0 < x <L\nv(x) =[ ML2/(2EI)] (x/L)2\nMb v|\n= ML2/(2EI) at x=L\nL\nv(x)\nmax\nUniformly Loaded Cantilever\nv(x)\nFor 0 <x <L\nL\nv(x)\nwo(x)\nv(x) = [ w L4/(24EI)] (x/L)2[(x/L)2 - 4(x/L) + 6]\no\nv|\n= w L4/(8EI)\nat x=L\nmax\no\nUniformly Loaded Simply-Supported Beam\nwo (x)\nv(x)\nL\nv(x) = [w\n0 L4/(24EI)] (x/L) [1 - 2(x/L)2 + (x/L)3]\n0 < x <L\nv|max = [5wo L4/(384EI)]\n=L/2\nFor\nat x\n\nDeflections due to Bending 269\nCouple, End-loaded Simply-Supported Beam\nPoint Load, Simply-Supported Beam\nWith these few relationships we can construct the deflected shapes of beams\nsubjected to more complex loadings and different boundary conditions. We do this\nby superimposing the solutions to more simple loading cases, as represented, for\nexample by the cases cited above.\nExercise 10.2\nShow that the expression obtained for the tip deflection as a function of end\nload in the previous exercise can be obtained by superimposing the dis-\nplacement fields of two of the cases presented above.\nWe will consider the beam deflection at the tip to be the sum of two parts: One\npart will be the deflection due to the beam acting as if it were cantilevered to a\nwall at the support point B, the middle figure below, and a second part due to the\nrotation of the beam at this imagined root of the cantilever at B --the figure left\nbelow.\nWe first determine the rotation of the beam at this point, at the support B. To\ndo this we must imagine the effect of the load P applied at the tip upon the\ndeflected shape back within the region 0 <\nx <L/4. This effect can be represented\nas an equivalent force system at B acting internally to the beam. That is, we cut\nv(x)\nL\nMb\nFor 0 < x <L\nv|max = [ ML2/(9√3 EI)] at x=L/√3\nv(x) = - [ML2/(6EI)] (x/L) [1 - x2/L2]\n(x)\nL\nb\nP\nFor 0<x<(L-b)\nv(x) = [PL3/(6EI)] (b/L) [ -(x/L)3 + (1-b2/L2)(x/L) ]\nFor (L-b) <x <L\nv(x) = [ PL3/(6EI)] (b/L) { (L/b) [(x/L)- (1-b/L)]3- (x/L)3+(1-b2/L2)(x/L)}\nv| = PL3/[9√3 EI)] (b/L)[1- b2/L2]3/2 at x=(L/√3)√(1-b2/L2)\nmax\nA\nB\n+\nB\nA\nrigid\nP\nP\nB\nA\nP\n\n270 Chapter 10\naway the portion of the beam x>L/4 and show an equivalent vertical force acting\ndownward of magnitude P and a clockwise couple of magnitude P(3L/4) acting at\nB.\nNow the force P produces no deflection. The couple M produces a rotation\nwhich we will find by evaluating the slope of the displacement distribution for a\ncouple, end-loaded, simply supported beam. From above we have, letting lower\ncase l stand in for the span from A to B,\nThis yields, for the slope, or rotation at the support point B,\ndv/dx|B = - Ml/(3EI) . The couple is M =3PL/4 so the rotation at B is\nThe deflection at the tip of the beam where the load P is applied due to this\nrotation is, for small rotations, assuming this portion rotates as a rigid body, by\nwhere the negative sign indicates that the tip displacement due to this effect is downward.3\nWe now superimpose upon this displacement field, the displacement of a beam\nof length 3L/4, imagined cantilevered at B, that is a displacement field whose\nslope is zero at B. We have, for the end loaded cantilever, that the tip displacement\nrelative to the root is -Pl3/(3EI) where now the lower case \"l\" stands in for the\nlength 3L/4 and we have noted that the load acts downward.\nWith this, the tip\ndeflection due to this cantilever displacement field is\nSo the final result, the total deflection at the tip is, as before,\n∆ = ∆rigid body + ∆cantilever = - 3PL3/(16EI).\n3.

We posed this challenge back\nin an earlier chapter. There we made an\nestimate based upon the maximum bending\nmoment within a uniformly loaded simply supported beam. We took w\n0L2/8 as\nour estimate. We can do better now.\nWe use superpositioning. We will consider the tip deflection of a uniformly\nloaded cantilever. We then consider the tip deflection of an end loaded cantilever\nwhere the end load is just the reaction force (the unknown reaction force because\nthe problem is statically indeterminate) at the end. Finally, we then sum the two\nand figure out what the unknown reaction force must be in order for the sum to be\nzero. This will be relatively quick and painless, to wit:\nFor the end-loaded cantilever we obtain ∆R = R L3/(3EI)\nwhere\nthe\ndeflec-\ntion is positive up.\nFor the uniformly loaded cantilever we have ∆wo= -w0L4/(8EI). The two sum to zero if\nand only if\nWe have resolved a statically indeterminate problem through the consideration\nof displacements and insisting on a deformation pattern compatible with the con-\nstraint at the end - that the displacement there be zero. With this, we can deter-\nmine the reactions at the root and sketch the shear force and bending moment\ndistribution. The results are shown below.\nL\nwo, force/length\nwo (x)\n+\nL\nR\n∆R = R L3/(3EI)\n∆wo= -w0L4/(8EI)\nR\n3 8\n⁄\n(\n) wo L\n⋅\n⋅\n=\n\n272 Chapter 10\nWe see that there are two positions\nwhere the bending moment must be\ninspected to determine whether it attains\na maximum. At the root we have |Mb| =\n(1/8)woL2 while at x=(5/8)L its magni-\ntude is (9/128)woL2. The moment thus\nhas maximum magnitude at the root. It\nis there where the stresses due to bend-\ning will be maximum, there where fail-\nure is most likely to occur4.\n10.2\nBuckling of Beams\nBuckling of beams is an example of a failure mode in which relatively large\ndeflections occur while no member or part of the structure may have experienced\nfracture or plastic flow. We speak then of elastic buckling.\nBeams are not the only structural elements that may experience elastic buck-\nling. Indeed all structures in theory might buckle if the loading and boundary con-\nditions are of the right sort. The task in the analysis of the possibility of elastic\ninstability is to try to determine what load levels will bring on buckling.\nNot all elastic instability qualifies as failure. In some designs we want buck-\nling to occur. The Tin Man's oil-can in The Wizard of Oz was designed, as were\nall oil cans of this form, so that the bottom, when pushed hard enough, dished in\nwith a snap, snapped through, and displaced just the right amount of oil out the\nlong conical nozzle. Other latch mechanisms rely upon snap-through to lock a fas-\ntener closed.\nBut generally, buckling means failure and that failure is often catastrophic. To\nsee why, we first consider a simple mechanism of little worth in itself as a\nmechanical device but valuable to us as an aid to illustrating the fundamental phe-\n4. If we compare this result with our previous estimate made back in exercise 3.9, we find the latter was the\nsame magnitude! But this is by chance; In the simply supported beam the maximum moment occurs at mid-\nspan. Here it occurs at the left end.\nx\nx\nMb(x)\nwo\n5woL/8\n3woL/8\nwoL2/8\nV(x)\n(5/8)L\n5woL/8\n+3woL/8\nMb|max = (9/128)woL2\nwoL2/8\n\nDeflections due to Bending 273\nnomenon. The link shown below is to be taken as rigid. It is fastened to ground\nthrough a frictionless pin but a linear, torsional spring of stiffness KT resists rota-\ntion, any deviation from the vertical. A weight P is suspended from the free end.\nWe seek all possible static equilibrium\nconfigurations of the system. On the left is\nthe one we postulate working from the per-\nspective of small deflections and rotations;\nthat is up until now we have always con-\nsidered equilibrium with respect to the\nundeformed configuration. We can call\nthis a trivial solution; the bar does not\nrotate, the reaction moment of the torsional\nspring is zero, the rigid link is in compres-\nsion.\nThe one on the right is more interesting.\nBut note; we consider equilibrium with\nrespect to a deformed configuration.\nMoment equilibrium requires that MT= P∆= PLsinφ\nor, assuming a linear, torsional spring ie., MT= KTφ:\nOur challenge is to find values of φ which satisfy this equation for a given load\nP. We wish to plot how the load varies with displacement, the latter measured by\neither ∆= Lsinφ or φ itself. That is the traditional problem we have posed to date.\nBut note, this equation does not solve so easily; it is nonlinear in the displace-\nment variable φ. Now when we enter the land of nonlinear algebraic equations,\nwe enter a world where strange things can happen. We might, for example,\nencounter multi-valued solutions. That is the case here.\nOne branch of our solution is the trivial solution φ = 0 for all values of P. This\nis the vertical axis of the plot below. (We plot the nondimensional load (PL/KT)\nversus the nondimensional horizontal displacement (∆/L). But there exists another\nP\nL\nP\nKT\nφ\n∆\nMT - P∆ = 0\nKT\nPL\n-------\n\nφ\n⋅\nφ\nsin\n-\n=\nφ\n(KT/PL)\n(KT/PL)<1\n(KT/PL)>1\ny=(KT/PL) φ\ny=sinφ\nPL/KT\n∆/L\ntrivial\nnon-trivial\n\n274 Chapter 10\nbranch, one revealed by the geometric construction at the right. Here we have\nplotted the straight line y = (KT/PL)φ, for various values of the load parameter,\nand the sine function y = sinφ on the same graph.\nThis shows that, for (KT/PL) large, (or P small), there is no nontrivial solution.\nBut when (KT/PL) gets small, (or P grows large), intersections of the straight line\nwith the sine curve exist and the nonlinear equilibrium equation has nontrivial\nsolutions for the angular rotation. The transition value from no solutions to some\nsolutions occurs when the slope of the straight line equals the slope of the sine\nfunction at φ = 0, that is when (KT/PL)=1, when\nHere is a critical, very special, value if there ever was one. If the load P is less\nthan KT/L, less than the critical value then we say the system is stable. The link\nwill not deflect. But beyond that all bets are off.\nWhat is the locus of equilibrium states beyond the critical load? We can, for\nthis simple problem, construct this branch readily. We find nontrivial solutions,\npairs of (PL/KT) and φ values that satisfy equilibrium most readily by choosing\nvalues for φ and using the equation to compute the required value for the load\nparameter. I have plotted the branch that results above on the left.\nYou can imagine what will happen to our structure as we approach and exceed\nthe critical value; up until the critical load any deflections will be insensible, in\nfact zero. This assumes the system has no imperfections say in the initial alignment of the link relative to ver-\ntical. If the latter existed, the link would show some small angular rotations even below the critical load. Once\npast the critical load we see very large deflections for relatively small increments\nin the load, and note the rigid bar could swing either to the right or to the left.\nAnother way to visualize the effect of exceeding the critical load is to imagine\nholding the mechanism straight while you take the load up, then, once past the\ncritical value, say by 20%, let go... and stand back. The system will jump toward\neither equilibrium state possible at that load to the left or to the right5.\nThe critical value is called the buckling load, often the Euler buckling load.\nBefore turning to the buckling of beams, we make one final and important\nobservation: If in the equilibrium equation taken with respect to the deformed\nconfiguration, we say that φ, the deviation from the vertical is small, we can\napproximate sinφ ≈φ and our equilibrium equation takes the linear, homogeneous\nform\n5. In reality the system would no doubt bounce around a good bit before returning to static equilibrium.\nPL\nKT\n-------\n=\nPL\nKT\n-------\n\n-\nφ\n⋅\n=\n\nDeflections due to Bending 275\nNow how do the solutions of this compare to what we have previously\nobtained? At first glance, not very well. It appears that the only solution is the\ntrivial one, φ = 0. But look! I can also claim a solution if the bracket out front is\nzero. This will happen for a special value, an eigenvalue, namely when\nPL/KT = 1.0.\nNow that is a significant result for, even though we cannot say very much about\nthe angular displacement, other than it can be anything at all, we have determined\nthe critical buckling load without having to solve a nonlinear equation.\nWe will apply this same procedure in our analysis of the buckling of beams. To\ndo so we need to develop an equation of equilibrium for a beam subject to a com-\npressive load that includes the possibility of small but finite transverse displace-\nments. We do this by considering again a differential element of a beam but now\nallow it to deform before writing equilibrium. The figure below shows the\ndeformed element acted upon by a compressive load as well as a shear force and\nbending moment.\nForce equilibrium in the horizontal direction is satisfied identically if we allow\nno variation of the axial load6. Force equilibrium of the differential element in the\nvertical direction requires\nwhile moment equilibrium about the station x yields\n6. The buckling of a vertical column under its own distributed weight would mean that P would vary along the\naxis of the beam.\n∆x\nwo(x)\nP\nV\nP\nV\nMb\n+ ∆V\nx\nP\nwo(x)\n∆x\nMb + ∆Mb\nV\nwo ∆x\n⋅\n-\n-\nV\n∆V\n+\n(\n)\n+\n=\nMb\nwo\n∆x\n(\n)2\n-------------\n⋅\n-\nV\n∆V\n+\n(\n) ∆x\n⋅\nMb\n∆Mb\n+\n(\n)\nP ∆v\n⋅\n+\n+\n+\n-\n=\n\n276 Chapter 10\nThe last term in moment equilibrium is only there because we have taken equi-\nlibrium with respect to the slightly deformed configuration. In the limit as ∆x\n→ 0 we obtain the two differential equations:\nIt is important to distinguish between the lower case and upper case vee; the\nformer is the deflection of the neutral axis, the latter the shear force. We obtain a\nsingle equilibrium equation in terms of displacement by first differentiating the\nsecond equation with respect to x, then eliminate the term dV/dx using the first\nequation. I obtain\nWe now phrase the bending moment in terms of displacement using the linear-\nized form of the moment-curvature relation, Mb/(EI) = d2v/dx2 and obtain\nAlong the way I have assumed that the applied distributed load w0(x) is zero.\nThis is no great loss; it will have little influence on the behavior if the end load\napproaches the buckling load. It is a straight forward matter to take its effect into\naccount. In order to focus on the buckling mechanism, we leave it aside.\nThis is a fourth order, ordinary, linear differential, homogeneous equation for\nthe transverse displacement of the neutral axis of a beam subject to an end load, P.\nIt must be supplemented by some boundary conditions on the displacement and its\nderivatives. Their expression depends upon the particular problem at hand. They\ncan take the form of zero displacement or slope at a point, e.g.,\nx\nd\ndV\nwo x\n( )\n=\nand\nx\nd\ndMb\nV\nP\nx\nd\ndv\n⋅\n+\n+\n=\nx2\nd\nd Mb\nP\nx2\nd\nd v\n⋅\n+\nwo x\n( )\n-\n=\nEI\n(\n)\nx4\nd\nd v\n⋅\nP\nx2\nd\nd v\n⋅\n+\n=\nv\n=\nor\nx\nd\ndv\n=\n\nDeflections due to Bending 277\nThey can also involve higher derivatives of v(x) through conditions on the\nbending moment at a point along the beam, e.g., a condition on\nThis last is a restatement of the differential equation for force equilibrium\nfound above, which, since we increased the order of the system by differentiating\nthe moment equilibrium equation, now appears as a boundary condition\nExercise 10.4\nA beam of Length L, moment of inertia in bending I, and made of a material\nwith Young's modulus E, is pinned at its left end but tied down at its other\nend by a linear spring of stiffness K. The beam is subjected to a compres-\nsive end load P.\nShow that the Euler buckling load(s) are determined from the equation\nShow also that it is possible for the system to go unstable without any elastic\ndeformation of the beam. That is, it deflects upward (or downward), rotating about\nthe left end as a rigid bar. Construct a relationship an expression for the stiffness\nof the linear spring relative to the stiffness of the beam when this will be the case,\nthe most likely mode of instability.\nWe start with the general solution to the differential equation for the deflection\nof the neutral axis, that described by the function v(x).\nLetting λ2 = (P/EI) this can be written more simply as\nIn this, c1, c2, c3, and c4 are constants which will be determined from the\nboundary conditions. The latter are as follows:\nMb\nEI\n(\n)\nx2\nd\nd v\n⋅\n=\nor on the shear force\nV\nEI\n(\n)\n-\nx3\nd\nd v\n⋅\nP x\nd\ndv\n-\n=\nP\nv(x)\nx\nL\nEI\nP\nKL\n-------\n\n-\nPL2\nEI\n(\n)\n⁄\nsin\n=\nv x\n( )\nc1\n=\nc2x\nc3\nP\nEI\n------x\nsin\nc4\nP\nEI\n------x\ncos\n+\n+\n+\nv x\n( )\nc1\n=\nc2x\nc3\nλx\nsin\nc4\nλx\ncos\n+\n+\n+\n\n278 Chapter 10\nAt the left end, x=0, the displacement vanishes so\nv(0) = 0 and since it is\npinned, free to rotate there, the bending moment must also vanish Mb(0) =0\nor\nd2v/dx2 =0\nwhile at the right end, x=L, the end is free to rotate so the bending\nmoment must be zero there as well:\nMb(L) =0 or d2v/dx2 =0\nThe last condition (we need four since there are four constants of integration)\nrequires drawing an isolation of the end.\nWe see from force equilibrium of the tip\nof the beam that\nwhere F is the force in the spring, positive if the end moves upward, and V, the shear force,\nis consistent with our convention set out prior to deriving the differential equation for v(x).\nExpressing V in terms of the displacement v(x) and its derivatives we can write our fourth\nboundary condition as:\nd3v/dx3 + (P/EI)dv/dx - (K/EI) v(L) = 0\nor\nd3v/dx3 + λdv/dx - β v(L) = 0\nwhere I have set β = K/EI.\nTo apply these to determine the c's, we need expressions for the derivatives of\nv(x), up to third order. We find\ndv/dx = c2 + c3λ cosλx - c4 λ sinλx\nd2v/dx2= - c3λ2 sinλx - c4 λ2cosλx\nd3v/dx3= - c3λ3 cosλx + c4 λ3 sinλx\nWith these, the boundary conditions become\nat x= 0.\nv(0)=0: c1 + c4 = 0\nd2v/dx2= 0:\n+ c4 = 0\nat x = L.\nd2v/dx2= 0: (λ2sin λL) c3 = 0\n( λ2 - βL )c2 - (sin λL) c3 = 0\nNow these are four, linear homogeneous equations for the four constants, c1-\nc4. One solution is that they all be zero. This, if your were to report to your boss\nwould earn your very early retirement. The trivial solution is not the only one. In\nfact there are many more solutions but only for special values for the end load P,\nP\nV\nF=K v(L) v positive up\nV+F=0 or V +Kv(L) = 0\n\nDeflections due to Bending 279\n(λ). We know from our prior studies of systems of linear algebraic equations that\nthe only hope we have for finding non zero c's is to have the determinant of the\ncoefficients of the linear system be zero. The eigenvalues are obtained from this\ncondition.\nRather than evaluate the determinant, we will proceed by an alternate path, no\nless decisive. From the second equation we must have c4 =0. Then, from the first\nwe must have c1=0.\nTurning to the third equation, we might conclude that c3 is zero as well. That\nwould be a mistake. For we might have sinλL =0.\nNow consider the last two as two equations for c2 and c3. The determinant of\nthe coefficients is\nwhich, when set to zero, can be written\nThis can be made zero in various ways.\n- We can have\n(P/KL) = 1\n- or we can set\nsin [PL2/(EI)]1/2= 0\nwhich has roots PL2/(EI) = π2, 4π2, 9π2,...\nThe critical eigenvalue will be the lowest one, the one which gives the lowest\nvalue for the end load P. We see that this depends upon the stiffness of the linear\nspring relative to the stiffness of the beam as expressed by EI/L3. For the mode of\ninstability implied by the equation (P/KL) = 1, we must have\nP = KL < π2EI/L2\nor K/ (EI/L3) < π2\nIf this be the case, then the coefficient of c2 in the last of our four equations will be zero.\nAt the same time, sinλL will not be zero in general so c3 must be zero. The only non-zero\ncoefficient is c2 and, our general solution to the differential equation is simply\nv(x)= c2x\nThis particular buckling mode is to be read as a rigid body rotation about the\nleft end.\nIf, on the other hand, the inequality goes the other way, then another mode of\ninstability will be encountered when\nP = π2EI/L2\nNow c2 must vanish but c3 can be arbitrary. Our deflected shape is in accord\nwith\nv(x) = c3 sin λx\nλ2\nβ L\n⋅\n-\n(\n)\nλL\n(\n)\nsin\n⋅\nP\nKL\n-------\n\n-\nPL2\nEI\n(\n)\n⁄\nsin\n=\n\n280 Chapter 10\nand is sketched below. Note in this case the linear spring at the end neither extends nor\ncontracts.\nObserve\n- There are still other special, or eigenvalues, which accompany other,\nhigher, mode shapes. The next one, corresponding to PL2/EI = 4π2,\nwould appear as a full sine wave But since the lower critical mode is the\nmost probable, you would rarely see this what remains as but a mathemat-\nical possibility.\n- If we let K be very large relative to (EI/L3), we approach a beam pinned at\nboth ends. The buckled beam would appear as in the figure above.\n- Conversely, If we let K be very small relative to the beam's stiffness, we\nhave a situation much like the system we previously studied namely a\nrigid bar pinned at an end but restrained by a torsional spring. In fact, we\nget the same buckling load if we set the KT of the torsional spring equal to\nKL2.\n- We only see the possibility of buckling if we consider equilibrium with\nrespect to the deformed configuration.\n10.3\nMatrix Analysis of Frame Structures\nWe return to the use of the computer as an essential tool for predicting the behav-\nior of structures\nand develop a method for the analysis of internal stresses, the\ndeformations, displacements and rotations of structures made up of beams, beam\nelements rigidly fixed one to another in some pattern designed to, as is our habit,\nto support some externally applied loads. We call structures built up of beam ele-\nments, frames.\nFrames support modern skyscrapers; your bicycle is a frame structure; a canti-\nlevered balcony might be girded by a frame. If the structure's members are\nintended to support the externally applied loads via bending, the structure is a\nframe.\nP\nL\nA\nv(x) = A sin λx\n\nDeflections due to Bending 281\nAs we did with truss structures, structures that\nare designed to support the externally applied\nloads via tension and compression of its mem-\nbers, we use a displacement method.\nOur final\nsystem of equations to be solved by the machine\nwill be the equilibrium equations expressed in\nterms of displacements.\nThe figure shows a frame, a building frame,\nsubject to side loading, say\ndue to wind. These\nstructural members are not pinned at their joints.\nIf they were, the frame would collapse; there\nwould be no resistance to the shearing of one floor relative to another. The struc-\ntural members are rigidly fixed to one another at their joints.\nSo the joints can\ntransmit a bending moment from one element to another.\nThe figure at the left shows how we might\nmodel the frame as a collection of discrete,\nbeam elements.\nThe number of elements is\nquite arbitrary.\nJust how many elements is\nsufficient will depend upon several factors,\ne.g., the spatial variability of the externally\napplied loads, the homogeniety of the materi-\nals out of which the elements are made, the\ndesired \"accuracy\" of the results.\nIn this model, we represent the structure as an\nassemblage of 16 elements, 8 horizontal, two\nfor each floor, and 8 vertical.\nAt each node\nthere are three degrees of freedom: a horizon-\ntal displacement, a vertical displacement, and\nthe rotation at the node.\nThis is one more\ndegree of freedom than appeared at each node of our (two-dimensional) truss\nstructure. This is because the geometric boundary conditions at the ends, or junc-\ntion, of a beam element include the slope as well as the displacement.\nWith 12 nodes and 3 degrees of freedom per node, our structure has a total of\n36 degrees of freedom; there are 36 displacements and rotations to be determined.\nWe indicate the applied external force components acting at but two of the nodes:\nX1, Y1 act at node 1 for example; M1 stands for an applied couple at the same\nnode, but we do not show the corresponding components of displacement and\nrotation.\nEquilibium in terms of displacement will require 36 linear, simultaneous equa-\ntions to be solved. This presents no problem for our machinery.\nWe will construct the system of 36 equilibrium equations in terms of displace-\nment by directly evaluating the entries of the whole structure's stiffness matrix. To\ndo this, we need to construct the stiffness matrix for each individual beam ele-\nment, then assemble the stiffness matrix for the entire structure by superimposi-\ntioning. What this means will become clear, I hope, in what follows.\nX1\nY1\nM1\nX2\nY2\nM2\n5 9\n7 11\n8 12\n\n282 Chapter 10\nOur approach differs from the way we treated truss structures. There we con-\nstructed the equilibrium equations by isolating each node of the truss; then wrote\ndown a set of force-deformation relations for each truss member; then another\nmatrix equation relating the member deformations to the displacement compo-\nnents of the nodes. We then eliminated the member forces in terms of these nodal\ndisplacements in the equilibrium equations to obtain the overall or global stiffness\nmatrix for the entire truss structure. Only at this point, at the end of our construc-\ntion, did we point out that that each column of the stiffness matrix can be inter-\npreted as the forces required to maintain equilibrium for a unit displacement\ncorresponding to that column, all other displacements being held to zero. This is\nthe way we will proceed from the start , now, constructing first the stiffness matrix\nfor a horizontal beam element.\nThe figure at the right shows such an\nelement. At each of its end nodes, we\nallow for an axial, a transverse force\nand a couple. These are assumed to be\npositive in the directions shown.\nThe\ndisplacement components at each of the\ntwo ends - v1, v2, in the transverse direc-\ntion, u1, u2, in the axial direction - and\nthe slopes at the ends, φ1 and φ2, are also\nindicated; all of these are positive in the\ndirections shown.\nThe bottom figure shows a possible\ndeformed state where the displacements\nan rotations are shown more clearly\n(save u2).\nOur first task is to construct the entries in the stiffness matrix for this beam\nelement. It will have the form:\nA basic feature of matrix multiplication,\nof this expression, is the following: each\ncolumn may be interpreted as the force\nand moment components, the left side of\nthe equation, that are required to main-\ntain a deformed configuration of a unit\ndisplacement corresponding to that col-\numn and zero displacements and rota-\ntions otherwise. For example, the entries\nin the first column may be interpreted as\nF1, S1...Q2 for the displacement\nu1 =1 and v1= φ1 = u2 = v2 = φ2 = 0\nS1, v1\nS2, v2\nQ1, φ1\nQ2 φ2\nF1, u1\nF2 u2\nφ1\nu1\nv1\nv2\nφ2\nF1\nS1\nQ1\nF2\nS2\nQ2\nu1\nv1\nφ1\nu2\nv2\nφ2\n=\n\nDeflections due to Bending 283\nThis turns out to be a particularly\neasy column to fill in, for this deforma-\ntion state, shown in the figure, only\nrequires\naxial\nforces\nF1\nand\nF2\nto\ninduce this displacement and maintain\nequilibrium.\nIn fact, if u1 =1, then the force required to produce this uint displacement is\njust (AE/L) 1. This meand that F2, in this case, must, in order for equilibrium to\nhold, be equal to - (AE/L).\nNo other forces or moments are required or engen-\ndered.\nHence all other elements of the first column of the stiffness matrix, the\ncolumn corresponding to u1, must be zero.\nThe elements of the fourth col-\numn, the column corresponding to\nthe displacement u2, are found just\nas easily.\nIn this case F2 = (AE/L)\nand F1 = - (AE/L) for equilibrium.\nOur stiffness matrix now has the\nform shown at the right. We con-\ntinue considering the second column\nand envision the displace configura-\ntion\nv1 = 1\nand u1 = φ1 = u2 = v2 = φ2\n=0.\nThe\nfigure\nat\nthe\nleft\nshows\nthe\ndeformed state.\nIn this it appears we\nwill require a S1 and a Q1 but no axial\nforce. Remember, we assume small dis-\nplacements and rotations so the axial\nforce does not effect the bending of the\nbeam element (and, similarly, bending of the beam does not induce any axial\ndeformation).\nOnly if we allow greater than small displacements and rotations\nwill an axial load effect bending; this was the case in buckling but we are not\nallowing for buckling.\nTo determine what end force S1, and what end couple, Q1, are required to make\nthe vertical displacement at the end of a cantilever equal 1 and the slope there zero\n- it's a cantilever because the vertical displacement and rotation at the right end\nmust be zero -we make use of the known expressions for the tip displacement and\nrotation due to an end load and an end couple, then superimpose the two to ensure\na vertical displacement of 1 and rotation of zero.\nFor a vertical, end load S1, we have from the relationships given on page\n182 ,\nF1, u1\nF2\nF1\nS1\nQ1\nF2\nS2\nQ2\nAE\nL\n-------- ?\n?\nAE\nL\n--------\n-\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\nAE\nL\n--------\n-\n?\n?\nAE\nL\n--------\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\nu1\nv1\nφ1\nu2\nv2\nφ2\n=\nV1=1\nQ1\nS1\nQ2\nS2\n\n284 Chapter 10\nFor an end couple, Q1, we have\nIf both\na vertical force and a couple\nact, then, superimposing, we obtain the\nfollowing two equations for determining\nthe vertical displacement and the rotation\nat the end of the beam:\nNow we set the vertical displacement\nequal to unity, v1 = 1, and the slope zero,\nφ1 =0, and solve these2 equations for the required end load S1 and the required end\ncouple Q1. We obtain:\nS1 = (12EI/ L3) and Q1 = (6EI/L2)\nThe force and couple at the right end of the element are obtained from equilib-\nrium. Without even drawing a free body diagram (living dangerously) we have:\nS2 = - (12EI/ L3) and Q2 = (6EI/L2)\nThus the elements of the second col-\numn of the matrix are found and our\nstiffness\nmatrix\nnow\nhas\nthe\nform\nshown.\nv1\nL3\n3EI\n---------\n\nS1\n⋅\n=\nand\nx\nd\ndv\nφ\n=\nL2\n2EI\n---------\n\nS1\n⋅\n-\n=\nv1\nL2\n2EI\n---------\n\n-\nQ1\n⋅\n=\nand\nφ1\nL\nEI\n------\n\nQ1\n⋅\n=\nS1\n-φ1\nv1\nEnd load.\nφ1\n-v1\nEnd couple\nQ1\nv1\nL3\n3EI\n---------\n\nS1\n⋅\n=\nL2\n2EI\n---------\n\n-\nQ1\n⋅\nφ1\nL2\n2EI\n---------\n\nS1\n⋅\n-\nL\nEI\n------\n\nQ1\n⋅\n+\n=\nv1=1\nQ1\nS1\nQ2\nS2\n\nDeflections due to Bending 285\nThe elements of the third\ncolumn, corresponding to a\nunit rotation φ1 = 1 and all\nother\ndisplacements\nand\nrotations\nzero,\nare\nfound\nagain\nfrom\ntwo\nsimulta-\nneous equations but now we\nfind, with v1 = 0 and φ1 = 1:\nS1 = (6EI/ L2)\nand\nQ1 =\n(4EI/L)\nAgain,\nthe\nforce\nand\ncouple at the right end of\nthe\nelement\nare\nobtained\nfrom equilibrium.\nNow we\nhave:\nS2 = - (6EI/ L2) and Q2 = (2EI/L)\nWith this, our stiffness matrix becomes as shown.\nF1\nS1\nQ1\nF2\nS2\nQ2\nAE\nL\n--------\n?\nAE\nL\n--------\n-\n?\n?\n12EI\nL3\n------------\n?\n?\n?\n6EI\nL2\n---------\n?\n?\n?\nAE\nL\n--------\n-\n?\nAE\nL\n--------\n?\n?\n12EI\nL3\n------------\n-\n?\n?\n?\n6EI\nL2\n---------\n?\n?\n?\nu1\nv1\nφ1\nu2\nv2\nφ2\n=\nF1\nS1\nQ1\nF2\nS2\nQ2\nAE\nL\n--------\nAE\nL\n--------\n-\n?\n?\n12EI\nL3\n------------\n6EI\nL2\n---------\n?\n?\n6EI\nL2\n---------\n4EI\nL\n---------\n?\n?\nAE\nL\n--------\n-\nAE\nL\n--------\n?\n?\n12EI\nL3\n------------\n-\n6EI\nL2\n---------\n-\n?\n?\n6EI\nL2\n---------\n2EI\nL\n---------\n?\n?\nu1\nv1\nφ1\nu2\nv2\nφ2\n=\n\n286 Chapter 10\nProceeding\nin\na\nsimilar\nway\nat\nthe\nright end of the beam\nelement, we can con-\nstruct\nthe\nelements\nof the final two col-\numns corresponding\nto a unit displace-\nment, v2 =1 (the fifth\ncolunm) and a unit\nrotation at the end,\nφ2 = 1, (the sixth col-\numn).\nOur\nfinal\nresult is:\nExercise 10.5\nConstruct the stiffness matrix for the\nsimple frame structure shown.\nWe employ the same approach as used in\nconstructing the stiffness matrix for the sin-\ngle, horizontal beam element.

Our method is a force method requiring only the\nsolution of (moment) equilibrium twice over.\nA Virtual Displacement Method for Beams\nThe game now is to construct the stiffness matrix for a beam element using dis-\nplacement and deformation/displacement considerations alone. We consider a\nbeam element, uniform in cross-section and of length L, whose end displacements\nand rotations are presecribed and we are asked to determine the end forces and\nmoments required to produce this system of displacements.\nIn the figure at the right, we show the\nbeam element, deformed with prescribed\nend displacements v1, v2, and prescribed\nend rotations φ1, φ2. The task is to find\nthe end forces, S1, S2 and end moments\nQ1, Q2, that will produce this deformed\nstate and be in equilibrium and we want\nto do this without having to consider\nequilibrium explicitly.\nWe start with equilibrium:7\nand take a totally unmotivated step, multiplying the first of these equations, the one ensur-\ning force equilbirium in the vertical direction, by some function v*(x) and the second, the\none ensuring moment equilbrium at any point along the element, by another function\nφ∗(x), then integrate the sum of these products over the length of the element.\nThe functions v*(x) and φ*(x) are quite arbitrary; at this stage in our game they could be\nanything whatsoever and still the above would hold true, as long as the shear force and\nbending moment vary in accord with the equilibrium requirements. They bear an asterisk\n7.

A small number, N, circular rods or tubes are uniformly dis-\ntributed around and fastened to two relatively rigid, end plates.\nThe rods are rigidly fixed to one of the end plates, say the plate at the left\nshown above. The other ends of the rods are designed so that they can be either\nfree to rotate about their axis or not; that is, the right ends can be fixed rigidly to\nthe plate or they can be left free to rotate about their axis.\nIf the rods are free to rotate about their axis, then all resistance to rotation of\nthe entire structure is due to the resistance to bending of the N rods. (Note not all\nN rods are shown in the figure). If, on the other hand, they are rigidly fixed at both\nends to the plates, then the torsional stiffness of the overall structure is due to\nresistance to torsion of the N rods as well as bending.\nA preliminary design of this apparatus is needed. In particular:\n- The torsional stiffness of the entire structure due to bending of the rods is\nto be of the same order of magnitude as the torsional stiffness of the entire\nstructure due to torsion of the rods.\n- The overall torsional stiffness should be such that the rotation can be made\nvisible to the naked eye for torques whose application does not require\nexcess machinery.\n- The apparatus should not fail, yield or break during demonstration.\n- It should work with rods of two different materials.\n- It should work with hollow tubes as well as solid shafts.\n- Attention should be paid to how the ends of the rods are to be fastened to\nthe plates.\n\nDeflections due to Bending 299\nDesign Exercise 10.2\nBack to the Diving Board\nReconsider the design of a diving board where now you ar to rely on the elas-\nticity of the board to provide the flexibility and dynamic response you desire.
