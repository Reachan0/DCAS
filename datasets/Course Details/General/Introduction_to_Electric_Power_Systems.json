Electric power has become increasingly important as a way of transmitting and transforming energy in industrial, military and transportation uses. Examples of new uses for electric power include all manners of electric transportation systems (electric trains that run under catenary, diesel-electric railroad locomotion, 'maglev' medium and high speed tracked vehicles, electric transmission systems for ships and diesel-electric locomotives, replacement of hydraulics in high performance actuators, aircraft launch and recovery systems, battery powered factory material transport systems, electric and hybrid electric cars and buses, even the 'more electric' airplane).\n\nElectric power systems are also at the heart of alternative energy systems, including wind and solar electric, geothermal and small scale hydroelectric generation.\n\nThe course material includes:\n\nfundamentals of energy-handling electric circuits, power electronic circuits such as inverters, and electromechanical apparatus\n\nmodeling of magnetic field devices and description of their behavior using appropriate models\n\nsimplification of problems using transformation techniques\n\nanalysis of power electric circuits, magnetic circuits, and elements of linear and rotating electric machinery\n\nuse of lumped parameter electromechanics to understand power systems\n\nmodels of synchronous, induction, and DC machinery\n\nthe interconnection of electric power apparatus and operation of power systems\n\nThe material in this subject will be useful to students who pursue careers or research in electric power systems, power electronic systems, vehicle electrical systems (e.g. electric or hybrid vehicles), development or use of electric motors and generators, robots and \"mechatronics\".\n\nText\n\nKirtley, James.\nElectric Power Principles: Sources, Conversion, Distribution and Use\n. Wiley, 2010. ISBN: 9780470686362.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe prerequisites for this course are\n6.002 Circuits and Electronics\nand\n6.013 Electromagnetics and Applications\nor permission of the instructor. Please consult with the instructor if there are any questions about preparation.\n\nCourse Expectations\n\n6.061 is an Advanced Undergraduate Subject in the area of Optics, Electromagnetics and Energy. Each student will complete 11 problem sets and 2 quizzes.\n\n6.690 is a graduate course, and carries H-level graduate credit. It will meet with 6.061 and will incorporate two additional elements:\n\nEach student taking 6.690 will have additional problems on the problem sets. These problems can be expected to require more initiative, in-depth analysis and will generally be harder than the problems expected in 6.061.\n\nEach student taking 6.690 will be asked to formulate and carry out an in-depth project in an area related to the subject. Past students have done projects on distributed generation, special purpose power systems and rebuilding the Afghanistan electric power grid. This project should be launched, fairly early in the term, after a meeting with the instructor.\n\nGrading\n\nIn the grading schemes below, the percentages are approximate and meant as a guideline.\n\nGrading Criteria for 6.061\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nHomework\n\n50%\n\nQuizzes (25% each)\n\n50%\n\nGrading Criteria for 6.690\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nHomework\n\n40%\n\nQuizzes (20% each)\n\n40%\n\nTerm project\n\n20%\n\nNote that the second quiz will be given during final exam period.",

R = 3,414 = 6, 828BTU/kWh\n.5\n3. Assume Coal energy content is 30,870 BTU/kg.\nIf R=11,000 BTU/kWh, then coal consumption is:\n11, 000BTU/kWh\nm =\n≈ 0.3563kg/kWh\n30, 870BTU/kg\nThen, if P = 1000MW = 106kW ,\nM = 106kW × .3563 = 3.563 × 105kg/h\n×365.25 × 24 = 3.12 × 109kg/yr = 3.12 × 106Tonnes/yr\n4. If R = 30, 890BTU/kWh,\n9, 500BTU/lWh\nm\n=\n≈ .3075kg/kWh\n30, 890BTU/kg\n×2.959kg CO2 /kg fuel =\n0.9kg CO2/kWh\n×600, 000 × 24 × 365.25 =\n4.79 × 109kg CO2/yr = 4.79 × 106T CO2/yr\nProblem 2: This problem is solved by superposition: Consider one source at a time and add the\nsolutions.\nVoc = 1 × 8||8 + 10 ×\n= 4 + 5 = 9\n8 + 8\n8||4\nIsc = 1 ×\n+ 10 ×\n×\n= .5 +\n=\n4 + 8||8\n8 + 8||4\n\nFunction Value\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8 0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\n0.45\n0.5\nTime, s\nFigure 1: Answer for Problem 5\n\nVoc\nNote that Rth = 4 + 8||8 = 8 and this confirms the previous answer: Isc = Rth\nThen:\nV = Voc ×\n= 9 ×\n= 4.5\n8 + 8\nProblem 3: There is a handy-dandy formula in Chapter 4 for this problem, expression 4.12.\n5 × 10\nR1 =\n= 2\n5 + 1010\n10 × 10\nR2 =\n= 4\n5 + 10 + 10\nBut this one can be done easily using more ad-hoc methods. Note driving point impedance\nis:\nR1 + R2 = 10||15 = 6\nThen the voltage divider ratio is:\nR2\n=\n=\nR1 + R2\nFrom which it is straightforward to conclude that R2 = 6 × 2/3 = 4 and R1 = 6 -R2 = 2.\nProblem 4: The bridge can be characterized as a thevenin equivalent circuit. Without the hori\nzontal resistor of value one, the open circuit voltage will be:\nVoc = 18 ×\n-\n= 18 ×\nThe Thevenin equivalent resistance is Rth = 2 × 1||4 = 5\n8 . So then, with the resistor of value\none is in place:\nVo = 18 ×\n×\n=\n1 + 8\nProblem 5: This is approximately the picture you should get.\n6.061 Homework Set 1\n\nProblem 6: For 6.690 only The key to doing this easily is shown in Figure 2, where one of the\ncells of the ladder is called out. It is easy to see that the driving point impedance of that cell\nof the ladder is simply 2R||2R = R and the transfer relationship between input and output is\nV = 2\n1 V-1. Moving left one cell, it is also clear the the driving point resistance looking into\nthe cell is still just R and the transfer is V-1 = 1\n2 V-2. This is true of each successive cell until\nwe reach the source. The voltage divider ratio between the source and the node just above\n2R||2R\nVs\nthe source is Vn = Vs × 2R+2R||2R =\n3 .\nIn this case, V = V1 × 1 ×2-6 +V2 × 1 ×2-5 if V1 = V2 = 5, this becomes: V = 5 ×\n1 + 1\n=\n×\n×\n=\n≈ .078125\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nV 0\n+\n-\nR\nV\n+\n-\n2R\n2R\n2R\n2R\n2R\n2R\nR\nV\nV\n+\n-\n+\n-\nR d\n2R\n-1\nR\n-2\nR\nV\nV\n+\n-\n+\n-\nR d\n2R\n-1\nFigure 2: Magic Ladder Circuit\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.061 / 6.690 Introduction to Electric Power Systems\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Current through the\ninductance is Ix = 12 + j5.46, and the voltage across the inductance is Vx = -41 + j90.48.\nSource voltage is Vs = 78.8 + j90.48, which has magnitude of 120 V (all of this is RMS). The\nresulting phasor diagram is shown in Figure 5.\nMaximum voltage at the outupt is clearly achieved when ω2LC = 1, when C = 351.8μF .\nR\nMaximum output voltage is Vr = Vs ωL ≈ 1.33 × 120 ≈ 159V. A plot of relative output vs.\ninput voltage is shown in Figure 6\nProblem 3: Noting that the switch will have the same average voltage as the source since they\nare separated only by an inductance, and that the switch is shorted by itself a fraction D of\nthe time, then < Vsw >= VC (1 -D) = VS , then the capacitor voltage must be:\nVs\nVC =\n=\n= 20V\n1 -D\n1 -.5\n\nR\nV = 120\nx\nV = -41.2 +j 90.4\nV = 78.8 + j 90.4\nS\nFigure 5: Phasor Diagram: compensated to equal voltage\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\nChapter 2, Problem 11, vr vs. C\nVoltage magnitude ratio\nC, microfarads\nFigure 6: Voltage transfer ratio vs. Capacitance\nThen, if VC is about constant, so will be L di .

We know that and we know the system\nvoltage VS , but we don't know the terminal voltage V .

This involves only\nthe magnitudes of the various phasors:\nVS\n2 = V 2 + (XI)2 = 2V XI sin ψ\nThis can be solved for the magnitude of terminal voltage V , using the straightforward solution\nfor a second order expression and is:\nV = -XI sin ψ ±\n(XI sin ψ)2 + VS\n2 -(XI)2\nSimplifying and noting that only the positive sign gives a reasonable answer:\nV =\nVS\n2 -(XI cos ψ)2 -XI sin ψ\nThis is evaluated by the script appended, and for power factor of 0.9 (current lagging), unity\nand 0.9 (current leading), respectively, terminal voltage is:\n\nx 10\nProblem Set 4, Problem 4\n6.5\n6.45\nReactive Power\nReal Power\n6.4\n6.35\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\nx 10\n-5\n-10\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\nCompensating Capacitance, microfarads\nFigure 11: Real and reactive power vs. compensating capacitors\nV1 = 1.0395e+04\nV2 = 9.9594e+03\nV3 = 9.5235e+03\nThen, for varying current, voltages are as shown in Figure!13.

Please note that, in part d), the voltage asked for is across the resistor. Plot this vs.\ncapacitance for .5Cc < C < 2Cc, where Cc is the capacitance you calculated in part b).\n2. Part e): For the conditions of part d), calculate and sketch (or plot) real and reactive\npower from the source.\nProblem 2: Problem 11 from Chapter 2 of the text.\nProblem 3: Figure 3 shows, in schematic form a boost converter. We will make some approxima\ntions to try to understand how this thing works. For this circuit, L = 10mH, C = 50μF and\nR = 40Ω. Source voltage is Vs = 10 volts.\nThe switch is operated in the same fashion as the switch in the 'buck' converter you analyzed\nin Problem Set 2. This one has a basic switching frequency of 10 kHz. So each cycle the\nswitch is on for ton = TD and off for toff = T(1 - D).\ns\n-\n+\nC\nR\nL\nV\nFigure 1: Boost Converter\n1. Assuming that the component values are such that current in the inductor is continuous\n(that is, never goes to zero), what is the output voltage as a function of the duty cycle\nD? What is the average current in the inductor?\n2. Now, assuming for the moment that the capacitor voltage is just about constant, what\nis the ripple in the inductor? Do a labeled sketch of that current, showing the average,\nmaximum and minimum values and the ripple amplitude.\n3. Assuming that inductor current is nearly constant, estimate ripple voltage across the\ncapacitor (which is also output voltage).\n4. How realistic were your assumptions?\n5. For 6.690: Use MATLAB to simulate a startup transient.Start with zero current in the\ninductor and zero voltage across the capacitor.\nUse a duty cycle of 50 %. Run the\nsimulation until you approach steady state.\n\nProblem 4: This is a transmission line problem. The situation is shown in Figure 2. The 8 kV\n(RMS) source is feeding a 100Ω load through a transmission line which may be represented as\na simple inductance. Two capacitors that can provide reactive power are connected at either\nend of the line.\nω L = 12Ω\n+\nC\n8,000 v\nΩ\nR = 100\nC\n-\nr\ns\nFigure 2: Compensated Load\n1. Assuming both capacitances to be zero, draw a phasor diagram showing sending and\nreceiving end voltages and voltage across the transmission line. What is power dissipated\nin the resistance?\n2. Size the receiving end capacitance Cr so that receiving end voltage is equal in magnitude\nto sending end voltage.\n3. For 6.690: Calculate and plot, over the range of 1μF < Cr < 3μF, receiving end voltage.\nYou will probably want to use MATLAB to do the grunge work here.\n4. For 6.690: Calculate and plot sending end real and reactive power, assuming that Cs =\nCr for the same conditions as the previous part.\nProblem 5: Current Source Inverter:\nFigure 3 shows, in highly simplified form, a situation similar to the inverters that are use for\nsome renewable generation sources (wind, solar, ...). The current source on the left represents\nan inverter that is injecting current into the power system. The system itself is represented\nby the reactive impedance (representing a transmission line) and the voltage source on the\nright. For the moment we will assume a single phase system, although that is not the way\nmost systems are built.\njX\n-\nVs\nI\nV\n+\nFigure 3: Inverter Connected to Power System\nAssume the transmission line reactance X = ωL = 4Ω. The voltage source on the right is\nVs = 10kV (RMS). The current source on the left injects 250 A (RMS) into the system with\na power factor angle with respect to its measured terminal voltage.\n\n1. Calculate the terminal voltage V , assuming the power factor of the current injection is:\na) unity, b) 0.9, current lagging voltage, and c) 0.9, current leading voltage.\n2. (For 6.690) Calculate and plot the terminal voltage for the same three cases for current\nbetween 0 < I < 250A\n3. (Also for 6.690) Do the same calculation, for the same set of power factor angles, but\nthis time assume the Real power varies between zero and 2.5 MW.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.061 / 6.690 Introduction to Electric Power Systems\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

When the\ncurrent pulse gets to the shorted end, since the voltage is zero, a reflected pulse is launched\nwith opposite voltage sign. This is a positive going pulse, so the current is doubled. At the\nmatched end, the first voltage pulse arrives after 150μS. The reflected pulse arrives 1 mS\nafter that. This is the end of the story as both pulses are absorbed by the matched resistor.\nThis is shown in Figure 2.\nProblem 1: Part 2: Chapter 3, Problem 4\n\nopen circuit sending end voltage is V\nVs\nr = cos\n= 500\n93 ≈537.8kV.

      "content": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\n6.061 Introduction to Power Systems\nClass Notes Chapter 10\nAnalytic Design Evaluation of Induction Machines ∗\nJ.L. Kirtley Jr.\nIntroduction\nInduction machines are perhaps the most widely used of all electric motors. They are generally\nsimple to build and rugged, offer reasonable asynchronous performance: a manageable torque-speed\ncurve, stable operation under load, and generally satisfactory efficiency. Because they are so widely\nused, they are worth understanding.\nIn addition to their current economic importance, induction motors and generators may find\napplication in some new applications with designs that are not similar to motors currently in\ncommerce. An example is very high speed motors for gas compressors, perhaps with squirrel cage\nrotors, perhaps with solid iron (or perhaps with both).\nBecause it is possible that future, high performance induction machines will be required to\nhave characteristics different from those of existing machines, it is necessary to understand them\nfrom first principles, and that is the objective of this document. It starts with a circuit theoretical\nview of the induction machine. This analysis is strictly appropriate only for wound-rotor machines,\nbut leads to an understanding of more complex machines. This model will be used to explain the\nbasic operation of induction machines. Then we will derive a model for squirrel-cage machines.\nFinally, we will show how models for solid rotor and mixed solid rotor/squirrel cage machines can\nbe constructed.\nThe view that we will take in this document is relentlessly classical. All of the elements that\nwe will use are calculated from first principles, and we do not resort to numerical analysis or\nempirical methods unless we have no choice. While this may seem to be seriously limiting, it serves\nour basic objective here, which is to achieve an understanding of how these machines work. It is\nour feeling that once that understanding exists, it will be possible to employ more sophisticated\nmethods of analysis to get more accurate results for those elements of the machines which do not\nlend themselves to simple analysis.\nAn elementary picture of the induction machine is shown in Figure 1. The rotor and stator are\ncoaxial. The stator has a polyphase winding in slots. The rotor has either a winding or a cage, also\n∗ c2003 James L. Kirtley Jr.\n\nin slots. This picture will be modified slightly when we get to talking of \"solid rotor\" machines,\nanon. Generally, this analysis is carried out assuming three phases. As with many systems, this\ngeneralizes to different numbers of phases with little difficulty.\nStator Core\nStator Winding\nin Slots\nRotor Winding\nor Cage in\nSlots\nRotor\nAir-Gap\nFigure 1: Axial View of an Induction Machine\nInduction Motor Transformer Model\nThe induction machine has two electrically active elements: a rotor and a stator.\nIn normal\noperation, the stator is excited by alternating voltage. (We consider here only polyphase machines).\nThe stator excitation creates a magnetic field in the form of a rotating, or traveling wave, which\ninduces currents in the circuits of the rotor. Those currents, in turn, interact with the traveling\nwave to produce torque. To start the analysis of this machine, assume that both the rotor and the\nstator can be described by balanced, three - phase windings. The two sets are, of course, coupled\nby mutual inductances which are dependent on rotor position. Stator fluxes are (λa, λb, λc) and\nrotor fluxes are (λA, λB, λC). The flux vs. current relationship is given by:\n⎡\n⎤\n⎡\n⎤\nλa\n⎡\n⎤\nia\n⎢ λb ⎥\n⎢ ib\n⎥\n⎢\n⎥\n⎢\n⎥⎢\n⎥\n⎢\n⎥\n⎢ LS\nMSR ⎥⎢\n⎥\n⎢ λc ⎥\n⎢\n⎥⎢ ic\n⎥\n⎢\n⎥ = ⎢\n⎥⎢\n⎥\n(1)\n⎢ λA ⎥\n⎢\n⎥⎢ iA ⎥\n⎢\n⎥\n⎣ MT\nLR\n⎦⎢\n⎥\n⎣ λB ⎦\nSR\n⎣ iB ⎦\nλC\niC\n\nwhere the component matrices are:\n⎡\n⎤\nLa\nLab\nLab\nL S = ⎢\n⎣ Lab\nLa\nLab ⎥\n⎦\n(2)\nLab\nLab\nLa\n⎡\n⎤\nLA\nLAB\nLAB\n⎢\n⎥\nL = ⎣ LAB\nLA\nLAB ⎦\n(3)\nR\nLAB\nLAB\nLA\nThe mutual inductance part of (1) is a circulant matrix:\n⎡\n⎤\nM cos(pθ)\nM cos(pθ + 2\nπ\nπ\n)\nM cos(pθ -\n)\nM\n= ⎢ M cos(pθ -2π)\nM cos(pθ)\nM cos(pθ + 2π) ⎥⎦\n(4)\nSR\n⎣\nM cos(pθ + 2\nπ\nπ\n)\nM cos(pθ -\n)\nM cos(pθ)\nTo carry the analysis further, it is necessary to make some assumptions regarding operation.\nTo start, assume balanced currents in both the stator and rotor:\nia =\nIS cos(ωt)\nib =\nIS cos(ωt -2\nπ)\n(5)\nic =\nIS cos(ωt + 2\nπ)\niA =\nIR cos(ωRt + ξR)\niB =\nIR cos(ωRt + ξR -2π)\n(6)\niC =\nIR cos(ωRt + ξR + 2\nπ)\nThe rotor position θ can be described by\nθ = ωmt + θ0\n(7)\nUnder these assumptions, we may calculate the form of stator fluxes. As it turns out, we need\nonly write out the expressions for λa and λA to see what is going on:\nλa\n=\n(La -Lab)Is cos(ωt) + MIR(cos(ωRt + ξR) cos p(ωm + θ0)\n(8)\n2π\n2π\n2π\n2π\n+ cos(ωRt + ξR +\n) cos(p(ωmt + θ0) -\n) + cos(ωRt + ξR -\n) cos(p(ωmt + θ0) +\n)\nwhich, after reducing some of the trig expressions, becomes:\nλa = (La -Lab)Is cos(ωt) +\nMIR cos((pωm + ωR)t + ξR + pθ0)\n(9)\nDoing the same thing for the rotor phase A yields:\n2π\n2π\nλA\n=\nMIs(cos p(ωmt + θ0) cos(ωt)) + cos(p(ωmt + θ0) -\n) cos(ωt -\n)\n(10)\n2π\n2π\n+ cos(p(ωmt + θ0) +\n) cos(ωt +\n) + (LA -LAB)IR cos(ωRt + ξR)\n\n\"\n#\n\"\n# \"\n#\nThis last expression is, after manipulating:\nλA =\nMIs cos((ω -pωm)t -pθ0) + (LA -LAB)IR cos(ωRt + ξR)\n(11)\nThese two expressions, 9 and 11 give expressions for fluxes in the armature and rotor windings\nin terms of currents in the same two windings, assuming that both current distributions are sinu\nsoidal in time and space and represent balanced distributions. The next step is to make another\nassumption, that the stator and rotor frequencies match through rotor rotation. That is:\nω -pωm = ωR\n(12)\nIt is important to keep straight the different frequencies here:\nω\nis stator electrical frequency\nωR\nis rotor electrical frequency\nωm\nis mechanical rotation speed\nso that pωm is electrical rotation speed.\nTo refer rotor quantities to the stator frame (i.e.\nnon- rotating), and to work in complex\namplitudes, the following definitions are made:\nλa = Re(Λaejωt)\n(13)\nλA = Re(ΛAejωRt)\n(14)\nia = Re(Iaejωt)\n(15)\niA = Re(IAejωRt)\n(16)\nWith these definitions, the complex amplitudes embodied in 58 and 66 become:\nΛa = LSIa +\nMIAej(ξR+pθ0)\n(17)\n-jpθ0\njξR\nΛA\nMIae\n+ LRIAe\n(18)\n= 2\nThere are two phase angles embedded in these expressions: θ0 which describes the rotor physical\nphase angle with respect to stator current and ξR which describes phase angle of rotor currents\nwith respect to stator currents. We hereby invent two new rotor variables:\nΛAR = ΛAejpθ)\n(19)\nIAR = IAej(pθ0+ξR)\n(20)\nThese are rotor flux and current referred to armature phase angle. Note that ΛAR and IAR\nhave the same phase relationship to each other as do ΛA and IA. Using 19 and 20 in 17 and 18,\nthe basic flux/current relationship for the induction machine becomes:\nM\nI\nΛa\n=\nL\nS\na\n(21)\nΛAR\n2 M\nLR\nIAR\n\nThis is an equivalent single- phase statement, describing the flux/current relationship in phase\na, assuming balanced operation. The same expression will describe phases b and c.\nVoltage at the terminals of the stator and rotor (possibly equivalent) windings is, then:\nV a = jωΛa + RaIa\n(22)\nV AR = jωRΛAR + RAIAR\n(23)\nor:\nV a = jωLSIa + jω MIAR + RaIa\n(24)\nV AR = jωR 2 MIa + jωRLRIAR + RAIAR\n(25)\nTo carry this further, it is necessary to go a little deeper into the machine's parameters. Note\nthat LS and LR are synchronous inductances for the stator and rotor. These may be separated\ninto space fundamental and \"leakage\" components as follows:\n3 4 μ0RlNS\n2kS\nLS = La -Lab = 2 π\np2g\n+ LSl\n(26)\n3 4 μ0RlN 2 k2\nLR = LA -LAB = 2 π\np2g\nR R + LRl\n(27)\nWhere the normal set of machine parameters holds:\nR\nis rotor radius\nl\nis active length\ng\nis the effective air- gap\np\nis the number of pole- pairs\nN\nrepresents number of turns\nk\nrepresents the winding factor\nS\nas a subscript refers to the stator\nR\nas a subscript refers to the rotor\nLl\nis \"leakage\" inductance\nThe two leakage terms LSl and LRl contain higher order harmonic stator and rotor inductances,\nslot inducances, end- winding inductances and, if necessary, a provision for rotor skew. Essentially,\nthey are used to represent all flux in the rotor and stator that is not mutually coupled.\nIn the same terms, the stator- to- rotor mutual inductance, which is taken to comprise only a\nspace fundamental term, is:\n4 μ0RlNSNRkSkR\nM = π\np2g\n(28)\nNote that there are, of course, space harmonic mutual flux linkages. If they were to be included,\nthey would hair up the analysis substantially. We ignore them here and note that they do have an\neffect on machine behavior, but that effect is second- order.\n\nAir- gap permeance is defined as:\n4 μ0Rl\n℘ag = π p2g\n(29)\nso that the inductances are:\n3 ℘agkS\n2 NS\n2 + LSl\n(30)\nLS = 2\nLR =\nRN 2\n(31)\n℘agk2\nR + LRl\nM = ℘agNSNRkSkR\n(32)\nHere we define \"slip\" s by:\nωR = sω\n(33)\nso that\npωm\ns = 1 -\nω\n(34)\nThen the voltage balance equations become:\nV a = jω 3 ℘agkS\n2 NS\n2 + LSl\nIa + jω 3 ℘agNSNRkSkRIAR + RaIa\n(35)\nk2\nV AR = jsω ℘agNSNRkSkRIa + jsω\n℘ag\nRNR\n2 + LRl\nIAR + RAIAR\n(36)\nAt this point, we are ready to define rotor current referred to the stator.\nThis is done by\nassuming an effective turns ratio which, in turn, defines an equivalent stator current to produce\nthe same fundamental MMF as a given rotor current:\nNRkR\nI2 =\nIAR\n(37)\nNSkS\nNow, if we assume that the rotor of the machine is shorted so that V AR = 0 and do some\nmanipulation we obtain:\nV a = j(XM + X1)Ia + jXMI2 + RaIa\n(38)\nR2\n0 = jXMIa + j(XM + X2)I2 +\nI2\n(39)\ns\nwhere the following definitions have been made:\n3 ω℘agNS\n2kS\n(40)\nXM = 2\nX1 = ωLSl\n(41)\n\nNSkS\nX2 = ωLRl\n(42)\nNRkR\n\nNSkS\nR2 = RA\n(43)\nNRkR\nThese expressions describe a simple equivalent circuit for the induction motorshow in Figure 2.\nWe will amplify on this equivalent circuit anon.\nIa Ra\nX1\nX2 I2\n∧ ∧ ∧\n∨ ∨\n-\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n⊃ Xm\n<\n<\n<\n>\n>\nR2\ns\nFigure 2: Equivalent Circuit\n2.1\nEffective Air-Gap: Carter's Coefficient\nIn induction motors, where the air-gap is usually quite small, it is necessary to correct the air-gap\npermeance for the effect of slot openings. These make the permeance of the air-gap slightly smaller\nthan calculated from the physical gap, effectively making the gap a bit bigger. The ratio of effective\nto physical gap is:\nt + s\ngeff = g\n(44)\nt + s -gf(α)\nwhere\n\ns\nf(α) = f\n2g\n= α tan(α) -log sec α\n(45)\nOperation: Energy Balance\nNow we are ready to see how the induction machine actually works.\nAssume for the moment\nthat Figure 2 represents one phase of a polyphase system and that the machine is operated under\nbalanced conditions and that speed is constant or varying only slowly. \"Balanced conditions\" means\nthat each phase has the same terminal voltage magnitude and that the phase difference between\nphases is a uniform. Under those conditions, we may analyze each phase separately (as if it were\na single phase system). Assume an RMS voltage magnitude of Vt across each phase.\nThe \"gap impedance\", or the impedance looking to the right from the right-most terminal of\nX1 is:\nR2\nZg = jXm (jX2 +\n||\ns )\n(46)\n\nA total, or terminal impedance is then\nZt = jX1 + Ra + Zg\n(47)\nand terminal current is\nVt\n(48)\nIt = Zt\nRotor current is found by using a current divider:\njXm\nI2 = It\nR2\n(49)\njX2 +\ns\n\"Air-gap\" power is then calculated (assuming a three-phase machine):\n2 R2\nPag = 3 I2\n|\n|\ns\n(50)\nThis is real (time-average) power crossing the air-gap of the machine. Positive slip implies rotor\nspeed less than synchronous and positive air-gap power (motor operation). Negative slip means\nrotor speed is higher than synchronous, negative air-gap power (from the rotor to the stator) and\ngenerator operation.\nNow, note that this equivalent circuit represents a real physical structure, so it should be possible\nto calculate power dissipated in the physical rotor resistance, and that is:\nPs = Pags\n(51)\n(Note that, since both Pag and s will always have the same sign, dissipated power is positive.)\nThe rest of this discussion is framed in terms of motor operation, but the conversion to generator\noperation is simple. The difference between power crossing the air-gap and power dissipated in the\nrotor resistance must be converted from mechanical form:\nPm = Pag -Ps\n(52)\nand electrical input power is:\nPin = Pag + Pa\n(53)\nwhere armature dissipation is:\nPa = 3|It|2Ra\n(54)\nOutput (mechanical) power is\nPout = Pag -Pw\n(55)\nWhere Pw describes friction, windage and certain stray losses which we will discuss later.\nAnd, finally, efficiency and power factor are:\nPout\nη =\n(56)\nPin\nPin\ncos ψ =\n(57)\n3VtIt\n\n% -----------------------------------------------------\n% Torque-Speed Curve for an Induction Motor\n% Assumes the classical model\n% This is a single-circuit model\n% Required parameters are R1, X1, X2, R2, Xm, Vt, Ns\n% Assumed is a three-phase motor\n% This thing does a motoring, full speed range curve\n% Copyright 1994 James L.

The\nmodel consists of two major parts. The first of these is a description of stator flux in terms of stator\nand rotor currents. The second is a description of rotor current in terms of air- gap flux. The result\nof all of this is a set of expressions for the elements of the circuit model for the induction machine.\nTo start, assume that the rotor is symmetrical enough to carry a surface current, the funda\nmental of which is:\nKr\n= ızRe Krej(sωt-pφ0)\n= ızRe Krej(ωt-pφ)\n(58)\nNote that in 58 we have made use of the simple transformation between rotor and stator\ncoordinates:\nφ0 = φ -ωmt\n(59)\nand that\npωm = ω -ωr = ω(1 -s)\n(60)\nHere, we have used the following symbols:\nKr\nis complex amplitude of rotor surface current\ns\nis per- unit \"slip\"\nω\nis stator electrical frequency\nωr\nis rotor electrical frequency\nωm\nis rotational speed\nThe rotor current will produce an air- gap flux density of the form:\nBr = Re Brej(ωt-pφ)\n(61)\nwhere\nR\nB = -jμ0\nK\n(62)\nr\nr\npg\n\nx 10\nWatts\n0 0\nRPM\n\nInduction Motor\nN-m\nFigure 3: Torque and Power vs. Speed for Example Motor\nNote that this describes only radial magnetic flux density produced by the space fundamental\nof rotor current. Flux linked by the armature winding due to this flux density is:\nZ 0\nλAR = lNSkS\nBr(φ)Rdφ\n(63)\n-π\np\nThis yields a complex amplitude for λAR:\nλAR = Re ΛARejωt\n(64)\nwhere\n2lμ0R2NSkS\nΛAR =\nKr\n(65)\np2g\nAdding this to flux produced by the stator currents, we have an expression for total stator flux:\nΛa =\n\nπ\nμ0N 2\nSRlk2\nS\np2g\n+ LSl\n!\nIa + 2lμ0R2NSkS\np2g\nKr\n(66)\nExpression 66 motivates a definiton of an equivalent rotor current I2 in terms of the space\nfundamental of rotor surface current density:\nπ\nR\nI2\nKz\n(67)\n= 3 NSkS\nThen we have the simple expression for stator flux:\n\n!\nX\nΛa = (Lad + LSl)Ia + LadI2\n(68)\nwhere Lad is the fundamental space harmonic component of stator inductance:\n3 4 μ0NS\n2kS\n2 Rl\nLad = 2 π\np2g\n(69)\nThe second part of this derivation is the equivalent of finding a relationship between rotor flux\nand I2. However, since this machine has no discrete windings, we must focus on the individual\nrotor bars.\nAssume that there are NR slots in the rotor. Each of these slots is carrying some current. If\nthe machine is symmetrical and operating with balanced currents, we may write an expression for\ncurrent in the kth slot as:\nik = Re Ikejsωt\n(70)\nwhere\n2πp\nIk = Ie -j NR\n(71)\nand I is the complex amplitude of current in slot number zero. Expression 71 shows a uniform\nprogression of rotor current phase about the rotor. All rotor slots carry the same current, but that\ncurrent is phase retarded (delayed) from slot to slot because of relative rotation of the current wave\nat slip frequency.\nThe rotor current density can then be expressed as a sum of impulses:\n⎛\n⎞\nNR-1\n2πp\nX 1\nj(ωrt-k NR\nKz = Re ⎝\nIe\n)δ(φ0\n2πk )⎠\n(72)\nR\n-NR\nk=0\nThe unit impulse function δ() is our way of approximating the rotor current as a series of\nimpulsive currents around the rotor.\nThis rotor surface current may be expressed as a fourier series of traveling waves:\ninf\nKz = Re\nKnej(ωrt-npφ0)\n(73)\nn=-inf\nNote that in 73, we are allowing for negative values of the space harmonic index n to allow for\nreverse- rotating waves. This is really part of an expansion in both time and space, although we are\nconsidering only the time fundamental part. We may recover the nth space harmonic component\nof 73 by employing the following formula:\n1 Z 2π\nK\n=<\nKr(φ, t)e -j(ωrt-npφ)dφ >\n(74)\nn\nπ 0\nHere the brackets <> denote time average and are here beause of the two- dimensional nature\nof the expansion. To carry out 74 on 72, first expand 72 into its complex conjugate parts:\nNR-1\n\n1 X\nI j(ωrt-k 2πp )\nI∗\n-j(ωrt-k 2πp )\n2πk\nNR\nNR\nKr = 2\nRe\n+ R e\nδ(φ0 -NR\n)\n(75)\nk=0\n\n(\n\nIf 75 is used in 74, the second half of 75 results in a sum of terms which time average to zero.\nThe first half of the expression results in:\nZ 2π NR-1\n2πpk\n2πk\nI\nX\n-j\nK\n=\ne\nNR ejnpφδ(φ -\n)dφ\n(76)\nn\n2πR 0\nNR\nk=0\nThe impulse function turns the integral into an evaluation of the rest of the integrand at the\nimpulse. What remains is the sum:\nNR-1\nI\nX\nj(n-1) 2πkp\nK\n=\ne\nNR\n(77)\nn\n2πR k=0\nThe sum in 77 is easily evaluated. It is:\nNR-1\nX\ne j 2πkp\nN\n(\nR\nn-1)\n=\nNR\nif (n -1) N\nP\nR = integer\n(78)\notherwise\nk=0\nThe integer in 78 may be positive, negative or zero. As it turns out, only the first three of these\n(zero, plus and minus one) are important, because these produce the largest magnetic fields and\ntherefore fluxes. These are:\n(n -1) N\np\nR\n-1\n- NR\np\n-p\n=\nor n =\n= 0\nor n = 1\n= 1\nor n = NR\np\n+p\n(79)\nNote that 79 appears to produce space harmonic orders that may be of non- integer order. This\nis not really true: is is necessary that np be an integer, and 79 will always satisfy that condition.\nSo, the harmonic orders of interest to us are one and\nNR\nn+ =\n+ 1\n(80)\np\nNR\nn-\n=\n-\np -1\n(81)\nEach of the space harmonics of the squirrel- cage current will produce radial flux density. A\nsurface current of the form:\nNRI ej(ωrt-npφ0)\n(82)\nKn = Re 2πR\nproduces radial magnetic flux density:\nBrn = Re Brnej(ωrt-npφ0)\n(83)\nwhere\nμ0NRI\n(84)\nBrn = -j 2πnpg\n\nIn turn, each of the components of radial flux density will produce a component of induced\nvoltage. To calculate that, we must invoke Faraday's law:\n∂B\nr × E\n-∂t\n(85)\n=\nThe radial component of 85, assuming that the fields do not vary with z, is:\n1 ∂\n∂Br\nR ∂φ Ez = -∂t\n(86)\nOr, assuming an electric field component of the form:\nEzn = Re Enej(ωrt-npφ)\n(87)\nUsing 84 and 87 in 86, we obtain an expression for electric field induced by components of air-\ngap flux:\nωrR\nEn =\nBn\n(88)\nnp\nμ0NRωrR\nEn = -j 2πg(np)2 I\n(89)\nNow, the total voltage induced in a slot pushes current through the conductors in that slot. We\nmay express this by:\nE1 + En- + En+ = ZslotI\n(90)\nNow: in 90, there are three components of air- gap field. E1 is the space fundamental field,\nproduced by the space fundamental of rotor current as well as by the space fundamental of stator\ncurrent. The other two components on the left of 90 are produced only by rotor currents and\nactually represent additional reactive impedance to the rotor. This is often called zigzag leakage\ninductance. The parameter Zslot represents impedance of the slot itself: resistance and reactance\nassociated with cross- slot magnetic fields. Then 90 can be re-written as:\nμ0NRωrR\nE1 = ZslotI + j\n2πg\n(n+p)2 + (n-p)2\nI\n(91)\nTo finish this model, it is necessary to translate 91 back to the stator. See that 67 and 77 make\nthe link between I and I2:\nNR\nI2 =\nI\n(92)\n6NSkS\nThen the electric field at the surface of the rotor is:\n6NSkS\n3 μ0NSkSR\nE1 =\nZslot + jωr π\ng\n(n+p)2 + (n-p)2\nI2\n(93)\nNR\nThis must be translated into an equivalent stator voltage. To do so, we use 88 to translate 93\ninto a statement of radial magnetic field, then find the flux liked and hence stator voltage from\nthat.

Similarly, 101 expresses\nrotor resistance in terms of slot resistance. Note that Lslot and Rslot are both expressed per unit\nlength. The second term in 100 expresses the \"zigzag\" leakage inductance resulting from harmonics\non the order of rotor slot pitch.\nNext, see that armature flux is just equal to air- gap flux plus armature leakage inductance.\nThat is, 68 could be written as:\nΛa = Λag + LalI\n(102)\na\nThere are a number of components of stator slot leakage Lal, each representing flux paths that\ndo not directly involve the rotor. Each of the components adds to the leakage inductance. The\nmost prominent components of stator leakage are referred to as slot, belt, zigzag, end winding, and\nskew. Each of these will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\nBelt and zigzag leakage components are due to air- gap space harmonics. As it turns out, these\nare relatively complicated to estimate, but we may get some notion from our first- order view of\nthe machine. The trouble with estimating these leakage components is that they are not really\nindependent of the rotor, even though we call them \"leakage\". Belt harmonics are of order n = 5\nand n = 7. If there were no rotor coupling, the belt harmonic leakage terms would be:\n3 4 μ0NS\n2k5\n2Rl\nXag5 = 2 π\n52p2g\n(103)\n3 4 μ0NS\n2k7\n2Rl\n=\nXag7\n2 π\n72p2g\n(104)\nThe belt harmonics link to the rotor, however, and actually appear to be in parallel with\ncomponents of rotor impedance appropriate to 5p and 7p pole- pair machines. At these harmonic\norders we can usually ignore rotor resistance so that rotor impedance is purely inductive. Those\ncomponents are:\nIn the simple model of the squirrel cage machine, because the rotor resistances are relatively\nsmall and slip high, the effect of rotor resistance is usually ignored. Then the fifth and seventh\nharmonic components of belt leakage are:\nX5 = Xag5kX2,5\n(107)\nX7 = Xag7kX2,7\n(108)\nStator zigzag leakage is from those harmonics of the orders pns = Nslots ± p where Nslots.\n3 4 μ0NS\n2Rl\nkns+\nkns-\nXz = 2 π\ng\n(Nslots + p)2 + (Nslots -p)2\n(109)\n\nZ\nZ\n\n!\nNote that these harmonic orders do not tend to be shorted out by the rotor cage and so no\ndirect interaction with the cage is ordinarily accounted for.\nIn order to reduce saliency effects that occur because the rotor teeth will tend to try to align\nwith the stator teeth, induction motor designers always use a different number of slots in the rotor\nand stator. There still may be some tendency to align, and this produces \"cogging\" torques which\nin turn produce vibration and noise and, in severe cases, can retard or even prevent starting. To\nreduce this tendency to \"cog\", rotors are often built with a little \"skew\", or twist of the slots from\none end to the other. Thus, when one tooth is aligned at one end of the machine, it is un-aligned\nat the other end. A side effect of this is to reduce the stator and rotor coupling by just a little,\nand this produces leakage reactance. This is fairly easy to estimate. Consider, for example, a\nspace-fundamental flux density Br = B1 cos pθ, linking a (possibly) skewed full-pitch current path:\nλ =\nl\n-l\nπ\n2p\nπ\n2p\n-\n+\nx\nl\nς\np\nB1 cos pθRdθdx\n+\nx\nl\nς\np\nHere, the skew in the rotor is ς electrical radians from one end of the machine to the other.\nEvaluation of this yields:\n2B1Rl sin ς\nλ =\nς\np\nNow, the difference between what would have been linked by a non-skewed rotor and what is\nlinked by the skewed rotor is the skew leakage flux, now expressible as:\nsin ς\nXk = Xag\n1 -\nς\nThe final component of leakage reactance is due to the end windings. This is perhaps the most\ndifficult of the machine parameters to estimate, being essentially three-dimensional in nature. There\nare a number of ways of estimating this parameter, but for our purposes we will use a simplified\nparameter from Alger[1]:\n14 q μ0RNa\nXe = 4π2 2\np2\n(p -0.3)\nAs with all such formulae, extreme care is required here, since we can give little guidance as to\nwhen this expression is correct or even close. And we will admit that a more complete treatment\nof this element of machine parameter construction would be an improvement.\n4.1\nHarmonic Order Rotor Resistance and Stray Load Losses\nIt is important to recognize that the machine rotor \"sees\" each of the stator harmonics in essentially\nthe same way, and it is quite straightforward to estimate rotor parameters for the harmonic orders,\nas we have done just above. Now, particularly for the \"belt\" harmonic orders, there are rotor\ncurrents flowing in response to stator mmf's at fifth and seventh space harmonic order.\nThe\nresistances attributable to these harmonic orders are:\n12lN 2k2\nR2,5 =\ns\n5 Rslot,5\n(110)\nNR\n\n(\n)\n12lNs\n2k7\nR2,7 =\nRslot,7\n(111)\nNR\nThe higher-order slot harmonics will have relative frequencies (slips) that are:\nn = 6k + 1\nsn = 1 (1 -s)n\n6k -1\nk an integer\n(112)\nn =\nThe induction motor electromagnetic interaction can now be described by an augmented mag\nnetic circuit as shown in Figure 17. Note that the terminal flux of the machine is the sum of all\nof the harmonic fluxes, and each space harmonic is excited by the same current so the individual\nharmonic components are in series.\nEach of the space harmonics will have an electromagnetic interaction similar to the fundamental:\npower transferred across the air-gap is:\nPem,n = 3I2\n,n\nR2,n\nsn\nOf course dissipation in each circuit is:\nPd,n = 3I2\n,nR2,n\nleaving\nPm,n = 3I2 R2,n (1 -sn)\n2,n sn\nNote that this equivalent circuit has provision for two sets of circuits which look like \"cages\".\nIn fact one of these sets is for the solid rotor body if that exists. We will discuss that anon. There\nis also a provision (rc) for loss in the stator core iron.\nPower deposited in the rotor harmonic resistance elements is characterized as \"stray load\" loss\nbecause it is not easily computed from the simple machine equivalent circuit.\n4.2\nSlot Models\nSome of the more interesting things that can be done with induction motors have to do with the\nshaping of rotor slots to achieve particular frequency-dependent effects. We will consider here three\ncases, but there are many other possibilities.\nFirst, suppose the rotor slots are representable as being rectangular, as shown in Figure 5, and\nassume that the slot dimensions are such that diffusion effects are not important so that current in\nthe slot conductor is approximately uniform. In that case, the slot resistance and inductance per\nunit length are:\nRslot\n=\nwshsσ\n(113)\nLslot\n=\nμ0\nhs\n3ws\n(114)\nThe slot resistance is obvious, the slot inductance may be estimated by recognizing that if the\ncurrent in the slot is uniform, magnetic field crossing the slot must be:\nI\nx\nHy = ws hs\n\nwd\nhd\nh s\nw s\nThen energy stored in the field in the slot is simply:\nhs\nZ\nμ0\nIx 2\n1 μ0hs I2\n= ws\ndx =\nLslotI2\nwshs\n6 ws\nFigure 5: Single Slot\n4.3\nDeep Slots\nNow, suppose the slot is not small enough that diffusion effects can be ignored. The slot becomes\n\"deep\" to the extent that its depth is less than (or even comparable to) the skin depth for conduction\nat slip frequency. Conduction in this case may be represented by using the Diffusion Equation:\nr2H = μ0σ∂\n∂t\nH\nIn the steady state, and assuming that only cross-slot flux (in the y direction) is important, and\nthe only variation that is important is in the radial (x) direction:\n∂2Hy\n∂x2 = jωsμ0σHy\nThis is solved by solutions of the form:\nHy = H±e ±(1+j) x\nδ\nwhere the skin depth is\ns\nδ =\nωsμ0σ\nSince Hy must vanish at the bottom of the slot, it must take the form:\nsinh(1 + j) x\nδ\nHy = Htop sinh(1 + j) h\nδ\ns\n\nSince current is the curl of magnetic field,\n∂Hy\n1 + j cosh(1 + j) hs\nJz = σEz = ∂x = Htop\nδ\nsinh(1 + j) h\nδ\nδ\ns\nThen slot impedance, per unit length, is:\n1 1 + j\nhs\nZslot = ws\nσδ coth(1 + j) δ\nOf course the impedance (purely reactive) due to the slot depression must be added to this. It\nis possible to extract the real and imaginary parts of this impedance (the process is algebraically a\nbit messy) to yield:\nsinh 2 h\nδ\ns + sin 2 h\nδ\ns\n=\nRslot\nwsσδ cosh 2 h\nδ\ns -cos 2 hs\nδ\nhd\nsinh 2 h\nδ\ns -sin 2 hs\n=\nμ0\n+\nLslot\nwd\nωs wsσδ cosh 2 h\nδ\ns -cos 2 h\nδ\ns\nδ\n4.4\nMultiple Cages\nThe purpose of a \"deep\" slot is to improve starting performance of a motor. When the rotor is\nstationary, the frequency seen by rotor conductors is relatively high, and current crowding due to\nthe skin effect makes rotor resistance appear to be high. As the rotor accelerates the frequency seen\nfrom the rotor drops, lessening the skin effect and making more use of the rotor conductor. This,\nthen, gives the machine higher starting torque (requiring high resistance) without compromising\nrunning efficiency.\nThis effect can be carried even further by making use of multiple cages, such as is shown in\nFigure 6. Here there are two conductors in a fairly complex slot. Estimating the impedance of this\nslot is done in stages to build up an equivalent circuit.\nAssume for the purposes of this derivation that each section of the multiple cage is small enough\nthat currents can be considered to be uniform in each conductor. Then the bottom section may be\nrepresented as a resistance in series with an inductance:\nRa\n=\nσw1h1\nμ0 h1\nLa\n=\n3 w1\nThe narrow slot section with no conductor between the top and bottom conductors will contribute\nan inductive impedance:\nhs\nLs = μ0 ws\nThe top conductor will have a resistance:\nRb = σw2h2\n\nw2\nhd\nhs\nh1\nh2\nws\nw1\nFigure 6: Double Slot\nNow, in the equivalent circuit, current flowing in the lower conductor will produce a magnetic field\nacross this section, yielding a series inductance of\nh2\nLb = μ0 w2\nBy analogy with the bottom conductor, current in the top conductor flows through only one third of\nthe inductance of the top section, leading to the equivalent circuit of Figure 7, once the inductance\nof the slot depression is added on:\nhd\nLt = μ0 wd\nLt\n1 Lb\n2 Lb\nLs\nLa\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n<\n<\n>\n>\n<> Rb\n<> Ra\n<\n<\nFigure 7: Equivalent Circuit: Double Bar\nNow, this rotor bar circuit fits right into the framework of the induction motor equivalent circuit,\nshown for the double cage case in Figure 8, with\n12lNS\n2kS\nR2a\n=\nRa\nNR\n12lNS\n2kS\nR2b\n=\nRb\nNR\n\n-\n\n12lN 2k2 2\nX2a\n=\nω\nS\nS ( Lb + Ls + La)\nNR\n12lNS\n2kS\nX2a\n=\nω\n(Lt +\nLb)\nNR\nIa Ra\nX1\nX2b I2 X2a\n∧∧∧\n∨∨\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n<\n<\nXm\n<> R2b\n<> R2a\n>\ns\n>\ns\n⊃⊃⊃⊃\n<\n<\n\nFigure 8: Equivalent Circuit: Double Cage Rotor\n4.5\nRotor End Ring Effects\nIt is necessary to correct for \"end ring\" resistance in the rotor.\nTo do this, we note that the\nmagnitude of surface current density in the rotor is related to the magnitude of individual bar\ncurrent by:\n2πR\nIz = Kz\n(115)\nNR\nCurrent in the end ring is:\nR\nIR = Kz\n(116)\np\nThen it is straightforward to calculate the ratio between power dissipated in the end rings to power\ndissipated in the conductor bars themselves, considering the ratio of current densities and volumes.\nAssuming that the bars and end rings have the same radial extent, the ratio of current densities is:\nJR\nNR wr\n=\n(117)\nJz\n2πp lr\nwhere wr is the average width of a conductor bar and lr is the axial end ring length.\nNow, the ratio of losses (and hence the ratio of resistances) is found by multiplying the square\nof current density ratio by the ratio of volumes. This is approximately:\nRend\nNR wr\n2 2πR lr\nNRRwr\n=\n=\n(118)\nRslot\n2πp lr\nNRl wr\nπllrp\n4.6\nWindage\nBearing friction, windage loss and fan input power are often regarded as elements of a \"black art\".\nWe approach them with some level of trepidation, for motor manufacturers seem to take a highly\n\nempirical view of these elements. What follows is an attempt to build reasonable but simple models\nfor two effects: loss in the air gap due to windage and input power to the fan for cooling. Some\ncaution is required here, for these elements of calculation have not been properly tested, although\nthey seem to give reasonable numbers\nThe first element is gap windage loss. This is produced by shearing of the air in the relative\nrotation gap. It is likely to be a signifigant element only in machines with very narrow air gaps or\nvery high surface speeds. But these include, of course, the high performance machines with which\nwe are most interested. We approach this with a simple \"couette flow\" model. Air-gap shear loss\nis approximately:\nPw = 2πR4Ω3lρaf\n(119)\nwhere ρa is the density of the air-gap medium (possibly air) and f is the friction factor, estimated\nby:\n.0076\nf =\nR\n(120)\nn\nand the Reynold's Number Rn is\nΩRg\nRn =\n(121)\nνair\nand νair is the kinematic viscosity of the air-gap medium.\nThe second element is fan input power. We base an estimate of this on two hypotheses. The\nfirst of these is that the mass flow of air circulated by the fan can be calculated by the loss in the\nmotor and an average temperature rise in the cooling air. The second hypothesis is the the pressure\nrise of the fan is established by the centrifugal pressure rise associated with the surface speed at\nthe outside of the rotor. Taking these one at a time: If there is to be a temperature rise ΔT in the\ncooling air, then the mass flow volume is:\nm =\nPd\nCpΔT\nand then volume flow is just\nm\nv = ρair\nPressure rise is estimated by centrifugal force:\nω\nΔP = ρair\np rfan\nthen power is given by:\nPfan = ΔP v\nFor reference, the properties of air are:\nDensity\nρair\n1.18\nkg/m2\nKinematic Viscosity\nHeat Capacity\nνair\nCp\n1.56 × 10-5\n1005.7\nm2/sec\nJ/kg\n\n4.7\nMagnetic Circuit Loss and Excitation\nThere will be some loss in the stator magnetic circuit due to eddy current and hysteresis effects\nin the core iron. In addition, particularly if the rotor and stator teeth are saturated there will be\nMMF expended to push flux through those regions. These effects are very difficult to estimate from\nfirst principles, so we resort to a simple model.\nAssume that the loss in saturated steel follows a law such as:\n\nf\nb\nωe\nB\nPd = PB\n(122)\nωB\nBB\nThis is not too bad an estimate for the behavior of core iron. Typically, f is a bit less than\ntwo (between about 1.3 and 1.6) and b is a bit more than two (between about 2.1 and 2.4). Of\ncourse this model is good only for a fairly restricted range of flux density.\nBase dissipation is\nusually expressed in \"watts per kilogram\", so we first compute flux density and then mass of the\ntwo principal components of the stator iron, the teeth and the back iron.\nIn a similar way we can model the exciting volt-amperes consumed by core iron by something\nlike:\n\nv1\n\nv2\nB\nB\nω\n+ V a2\n(123)\nQc =\nV a1\nBB\nBB\nωB\nThis, too, is a form that appears to be valid for some steels. Quite obviously it may be necessary\nto develop different forms of curve 'fits' for different materials.\nFlux density (RMS) in the air-gap is:\npVa\nBr =\n(124)\n2RlNak1ωs\nThen flux density in the stator teeth is:\nwt + w1\nBt = Br\n(125)\nwt\nwhere wt is tooth width and w1 is slot top width. Flux in the back-iron of the core is\nR\n(126)\nBc = Br pdc\nwhere dc is the radial depth of the core.\nOne way of handling this loss is to assume that the core handles flux corresponding to terminal\nvoltage, add up the losses and then compute an equivalent resistance and reactance:\nrc = 3|Va|2\nPcore\nxc = 3|Va|2\nQcore\nthen put this equivalent resistance in parallel with the air-gap reactance element in the equivalent\ncircuit.\n\nSolid Iron Rotor Bodies\nSolid steel rotor electric machines (SSRM) can be made to operate with very high surface speeds and\nare thus suitable for use in high RPM situations. They resemble, in form and function, hysteresis\nmachines. However, asynchronous operation will produce higher power output because it takes\nadvantage of higher flux density. We consider here the interactions to be expected from solid iron\nrotor bodies. The equivalent circuits can be placed in parallel (harmonic-by-harmonic) with the\nequivalent circuits for the squirrel cage, if there is also a cage in the machine.\nTo estimate the rotor parameters R2s and X2s, we assume that important field quantities in\nthe machine are sinusoidally distributed in time and space, so that radial flux density is:\nBr = Re Brej(ωt-pφ)\n(127)\nand, similarly, axially directed rotor surface current is:\nKz = Re Kzej(ωt-pφ)\n(128)\nNow, since by Faraday's law:\n∂B\nr × E\n-∂t\n(129)\n=\nwe have, in this machine geometry:\n1 ∂\n∂Br\nR ∂φ Ez = -∂t\n(130)\nThe transformation between rotor and stator coordinates is:\nφ0 = φ -ωmt\n(131)\nwhere ωm is rotor speed. Then:\npωm = ω -ωr = ω(1 -s)\n(132)\nand\nNow, axial electric field is, in the frame of the rotor, just:\nEz\n=\nRe Ezej(ωt-pφ)\n(133)\n=\nRe E ej(ωrt-pφ0)\n(134)\nz\nand\nωrR\nE =\nB\n(135)\nz\nr\np\nOf course electric field in the rotor frame is related to rotor surface current by:\nE = Z K\n(136)\nz\ns\nz\nNow these quantities can be related to the stator by noting that air-gap voltage is related to\nradial flux density by:\nBr =\np\nV ag\n(137)\n2lNak1Rω\n\nThe stator-equivalent rotor current is:\nπ\nR\nI2 =\nKz\n(138)\n3 Naka\nThen we can find stator referred, rotor equivalent impedance to be:\nV ag\n3 4 l\nω E\nZ2\nN 2k2\nz\n=\n=\na\na\n(139)\nI2\n2 π R\nωr Kz\ns\nNow, if rotor surface impedance can be expressed as:\nZs = Rs + jωrLs\n(140)\nthen\nR2\nZ2 =\n+ jX2\n(141)\ns\nwhere\n3 4 l\nR2 =\nNa\n2k1\n2Rs\n(142)\n2 π R\n3 4 l\nX2 =\nNa\n2k1\n2Xs\n(143)\n2 π R\nNow, to find the rotor surface impedance, we make use of a nonlinear eddy-current model proposed\nby Agarwal. First we define an equivalent penetration depth (similar to a skin depth):\n2Hm\nδ =\n(144)\nωrσB0\nwhere σ is rotor surface material volume conductivity, B0, \"saturation flux density\" is taken to be\n75 % of actual saturation flux density and\n3 Naka\nHm = |Kz| = π\nR |I2\n(145)\n|\nThen rotor surface resistivity and surface reactance are:\n16 1\nRs\n=\n(146)\n3π σδ\nXs\n=\n.5Rs\n(147)\nNote that the rotor elements X2 and R2 depend on rotor current I2, so the problem is nonlinear.\nWe find, however, that a simple iterative solution can be used. First we make a guess for R2 and find\ncurrents. Then we use those currents to calculate R2 and solve again for current. This procedure\nis repeated until convergence, and the problem seems to converge within just a few steps.\nAside from the necessity to iterate to find rotor elements, standard network techniques can be\nused to find currents, power input to the motor and power output from the motor, torque, etc.\n\n5.1\nSolution\nNot all of the equivalent circuit elements are known as we start the solution. To start, we assume\na value for R2, possibly some fraction of Xm, but the value chosen doesn not seem to matter\nmuch. The rotor reactance X2 is just a fraction of R2. Then, we proceed to compute an \"air-gap\"\nimpedance, just the impedance looking into the parallel combination of magnetizing and rotor\nbranches:\nR2\n||\ns )\n(148)\nZg = jXm (jX2 +\n(Note that, for a generator, slip s is negative).\nA total impedance is then\nZt = jX1 + R1 + Zg\n(149)\nand terminal current is\nIt = Vt\nZt\n(150)\nRotor current is just:\nI2 = It\njXm\njX2 + R2\ns\n(151)\nNow it is necessary to iteratively correct rotor impedance. This is done by estimating flux\ndensity at the surface of the rotor using (145), then getting a rotor surface impedance using (146)\nand using that and (143 to estimate a new value for R2. Then we start again with (148). The\nprocess \"drops through\" this point when the new and old estimates for R2 agree to some criterion.\n5.2\nHarmonic Losses in Solid Steel\nIf the rotor of the machine is constructed of solid steel, there will be eddy currents induced on the\nrotor surface by the higher-order space harmonics of stator current. These will produce magnetic\nfields and losses.\nThis calculation assumes the rotor surface is linear and smooth and can be\ncharacterized by a conductivity and relative permeability. In this discussion we include two space\nharmonics (positive and negative going). In practice it may be necessary to carry four (or even\nmore) harmonics, including both 'belt' and 'zigzag' order harmonics.\nTerminal current produces magnetic field in the air-gap for each of the space harmonic orders,\nand each of these magnetic fields induces rotor currents of the same harmonic order.\nThe \"magnetizing\" reactances for the two harmonic orders, really the two components of the\nzigzag leakage, are:\nk2\nXzp = Xm\np\nk2\n(152)\nNp2 1\nk2\nXzn = Xm N 2\nn\nk2\n(153)\nn\nwhere Np and Nn are the positive and negative going harmonic orders: For 'belt' harmonics\nthese orders are 7 and 5. For 'zigzag' they are:\nNs + p\nNp =\n(154)\np\n\ns\nNn = Ns -p\n(155)\np\nNow, there will be a current on the surface of the rotor at each harmonic order, and following 67,\nthe equivalent rotor element current is:\nπ\nR K\n(156)\nI2p = 3 Nakp\np\nπ\nR K\n(157)\nI2n =\nn\n3 Nakn\nThese currents flow in response to the magnetic field in the air-gap which in turn produces an\naxial electric field. Viewed from the rotor this electric field is:\nEp = spωRBp\n(158)\nEn = snωRBn\n(159)\nwhere the slip for each of the harmonic orders is:\nsp = 1 -Np(1 -s)\n(160)\nsn = 1 + Np(1 -s)\n(161)\nand then the surface currents that flow in the surface of the rotor are:\nE\nK =\np\n(162)\np\nZsp\nE\nK\n=\nn\n(163)\nn\nZsn\nwhere Zsp and Zsn are the surface impedances at positive and negative harmonic slip frequencies,\nrespectively. Assuming a linear surface, these are, approximately:\n1 + j\nZs =\n(164)\nσδ\nwhere σ is material restivity and the skin depth is\nδ =\n(165)\nωsμσ\nand ωs is the frequency of the given harmonic from the rotor surface. We can postulate that the\nappropriate value of μ to use is the same as that estimated in the nonlinear calculation of the space\nfundamental, but this requires empirical confirmation.\nThe voltage induced in the stator by each of these space harmonic magnetic fluxes is:\n2NakplRω\nVp =\nNpp\nBp\n(166)\n2NaknlRω\nVn =\nBn\n(167)\nNnp\n\nThen the equivalent circuit impedance of the rotor is just:\nVp\n3 4 N 2\na k2\npl Zsp\nZ2p =\n=\n(168)\nIp\n2 π NpR\nsp\nV\n3 4 N2k2\nn\na\nnl Zsn\nZ2n =\n=\n(169)\nIn\n2 π NnR\nsn\nThe equivalent rotor circuit elements are now:\n3 4 N 2\na k2\npl 1\nR2p =\n(170)\n2 π NpR σδp\n3 4 N2k2\na\nnl 1\nR2n =\n(171)\n2 π NnR σδn\nX2p =\nR2p\n(172)\nX2n =\nR2n\n(173)\n5.3\nStray Losses\nSo far in this document, we have outlined the major elements of torque production and consequently\nof machine performance. We have also discussed, in some cases, briefly, the major sources of loss\nin induction machines.\nUsing what has been outlined in this document will give a reasonable\nimpression of how an induction machine works. We have also discussed some of the stray load\nlosses: those which can be (relatively) easily accounted for in an equivalent circuit description of\nthe machine. But there are other losses which will occur and which are harder to estimate. We do\nnot claim to do a particularly accurate job of estimating these losses, and fortunately they do not\nnormally turn out to be very large. To be accounted for here are:\n1. No-load losses in rotor teeth because of stator slot opening modulation of fundamental flux\ndensity,\n2. Load losses in the rotor teeth because of stator zigzag mmf, and\n3. No-load losses in the solid rotor body (if it exists) due to stator slot opening modulation of\nfundamental flux density.\nNote that these losses have a somewhat different character from the other miscellaneous losses we\ncompute. They show up as drag on the rotor, so we subtract their power from the mechanical\noutput of the machine. The first and third of these are, of course, very closely related so we take\nthem first.\nThe stator slot openings 'modulate' the space fundamental magnetic flux density. We may\nestimate a slot opening angle (relative to the slot pitch):\n2πwdNs\nwdNs\nθD =\n=\n2πr\nr\n\ns\nThen the amplitude of the magnetic field disturbance is:\nθD\nsin\nBH = Br1 π\nIn fact, this flux disturbance is really in the form of two traveling waves, one going forward and one\nbackward with respect to the stator at a velocity of ω/Ns. Since operating slip is relatively small,\nthe two variations will have just about the same frequency as viewed from the rotor, so it seems\nreasonable to lump them together. The frequency is:\nNs\nωH = ω p\nNow, for laminated rotors this magnetic field modulation will affect the tips of rotor teeth. We\nassume (perhaps arbitrarily) that the loss due to this magnetic field modulation can be estimated\nfrom ordinary steel data (as we estimated core loss above) and that only the rotor teeth, not any of\nthe rotor body, are affected. The method to be used is straightforward and follows almost exactly\nwhat was done for core loss, with modification only of the frequency and field amplitude.\nFor solid steel rotors the story is only a little different. The magnetic field will produce an axial\nelectric field:\nω\nE = R\nz\nBH\np\nand that, in turn, will drive a surface current\nE\nK =\nz\nz\nZs\nNow, what is important is the magnitude of the surface current, and since |Z | =\n√\n1 + .52Rs ≈\ns\n1.118Rs, we can simply use rotor resistance. The nonlinear surface penetration depth is:\n2B0\nδ =\nωHσ Kz\n|\n|\nA brief iterative substitution, re-calculating δ and then Kz quickly yields consistent values for δ\n|\n|\nand Rs. Then the full-voltage dissipation is:\nz\nPrs = 2πRl |K |2\nσδ\nand an equivalent resistance is:\nRrs = 3|Va|2\nPrs\nFinally, the zigzag order current harmonics in the stator will produce magnetic fields in the\nair gap which will drive magnetic losses in the teeth of the rotor. Note that this is a bit different\nfrom the modulation of the space fundamental produced by the stator slot openings (although the\nharmonic order will be the same, the spatial orientation will be different and will vary with load\ncurrent). The magnetic flux in the air-gap is most easily related to the equivalent circuit voltage\non the nth harmonic:\n\nnpvn\nBn = 2lRNaknomega\nThis magnetic field variation will be substantial only for the zigzag order harmonics: the belt\nharmonics will be essentially shorted out by the rotor cage and those losses calculated within\nthe equivalent circuit. The frequency seen by the rotor is that of the space harmonics, already\ncalculated, and the loss can be estimated in the same way as core loss, although as we have pointed\nout it appears as a 'drag' on the rotor.\nInduction Motor Speed Control\n6.1\nIntroduction\nThe inherent attributes of induction machines make them very attractive for drive applications.\nThey are rugged, economical to build and have no sliding contacts to wear. The difficulty with\nusing induction machines in servomechanisms and variable speed drives is that they are \"hard to\ncontrol\", since their torque-speed relationship is complex and nonlinear. With, however, modern\npower electronics to serve as frequency changers and digital electronics to do the required arithmetic,\ninduction machines are seeing increasing use in drive applications.\nIn this chapter we develop models for control of induction motors. The derivation is quite brief\nfor it relies on what we have already done for synchronous machines. In this chapter, however, we\nwill stay in \"ordinary\" variables, skipping the per-unit normalization.\n6.2\nVolts/Hz Control\nRemembering that induction machines generally tend to operate at relatively low per unit slip, we\nmight conclude that one way of building an adjustable speed drive would be to supply an induction\nmotor with adjustable stator frequency. And this is, indeed, possible. One thing to remember is\nthat flux is inversely proportional to frequency, so that to maintain constant flux one must make\nstator voltage proportional to frequency (hence the name \"constant volts/Hz\"). However, voltage\nsupplies are always limited, so that at some frequency it is necessary to switch to constant voltage\ncontrol. The analogy to DC machines is fairly direct here: below some \"base\" speed, the machine\nis controlled in constant flux (\"volts/Hz\") mode, while above the base speed, flux is inversely\nproportional to speed. It is easy to see that the maximum torque is then inversely to the square of\nflux, or therefore to the square of frequency.\nTo get a first-order picture of how an induction machine works at adjustable speed, start with\nthe simplified equivalent network that describes the machine, as shown in Figure 9\nEarlier in this chapter, it was shown that torque can be calculated by finding the power dissi\npated in the virtual resistance R2/s and dividing by electrical speed. For a three phase machine,\nand assuming we are dealing with RMS magnitudes:\np\n2 R2\nTe = 3ω |I2|\ns\nwhere ω is the electrical frequency and p is the number of pole pairs. It is straightforward to find\nI2 using network techniques. As an example, Figure 10 shows a series of torque/speed curves for\n\n-\n\nIa Ra\nX1\nX2 I2\n∧∧∧\n∨∨\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n<\nXm\n<> R2\n> s\n<\n⊃⊃⊃⊃\nFigure 9: Equivalent Circuit\nan induction machine operated with a wide range of input frequencies, both below and above its\n\"base\" frequency. The parameters of this machine are:\nNumber of Phases\nNumber of Pole Pairs\nRMS Terminal Voltage (line-line)\nFrequency (Hz)\nStator Resistance R1\n.06 Ω\nRotor Resistance R2\n.055 Ω\nStator Leakage X1\n.34 Ω\nRotor Leakage X2\n.33 Ω\nMagnetizing Reactance Xm\n10.6 Ω\nStrategy for operating the machine is to make terminal voltage magnitude proportional to frequency\nfor input frequencies less than the \"Base Frequency\", in this case 60 Hz, and to hold voltage constant\nfor frequencies above the \"Base Frequency\".\nFor high frequencies the torque production falls fairly rapidly with frequency (as it turns out,\nit is roughly proportional to the inverse of the square of frequency). It also falls with very low\nfrequency because of the effects of terminal resistance. We will look at this next.\n6.3\nIdealized Model: No Stator Resistance\nIgnore, for the moment, R1. An equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 11. It is fairly easy to show\nthat, from the rotor, the combination of source, armature leakage and magnetizing branch can be\nreplaced by its equivalent circuit, as shown in in Figure 12.\nIn the circuit of Figure 12, the parameters are:\nV 0\n=\nV\nXm\nXm + X1\nX0\n=\nXm||X1\nIf the machine is operated at variable frequency ω, but the reactance is established at frequency\nωB, current is:\nV 0\nI =\n+\nj(X1\n0 + X2) ω\nω\nB\nR\ns\n\n-\n\nInduction Motor Torque\nN-m\nSpeed, RPM\nFigure 10: Induction Machine Torque-Speed Curves\nIa X1\nX2 I2\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n<\n+\n> R2\nV\nXm\n<\nFigure 11: Idealized Circuit: Ignore Armature Resistance\nand then torque is\n2 R2\n3p\nV 0 2 R\ns\nTe = 3 I2\n=\n|\n|\ns\nω (X1\n0 +\n|\nX2\n|\n)2 + ( R\ns\n2 )2\nNow, if we note that what counts is the absolute slip of the rotor, we might define a slip with\nrespect to base frequency:\nωr\nωr ωB\nωB\ns =\n=\n= sB\nω\nωB ω\nω\nThen, if we assume that voltage is applied proportional to frequency:\nω\nV 0\nV 0\n=\n0 ωB\nand with a little manipulation, we get:\n3p\n|V0\n0|2 R2\nsB\nTe = ωB (X1\n0 + X2)2 + ( R2 )2\nsB\n\n-\n⊃⊃⊃⊃\n< > s\n\n-\n\n-\n< > s\nIa X1\nX2 I2\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n<\n+ V 0\n<> R2\nFigure 12: Idealized Equivalent\nThis would imply that torque is, if voltage is proportional to frequency, meaning constant applied\nflux, dependent only on absolute slip. The torque-speed curve is a constant, dependent only on the\ndifference between synchronous and actual rotor speed.\nThis is fine, but eventually, the notion of \"volts per Hz\" runs out because at some number of\nHz, there are no more volts to be had. This is generally taken to be the \"base\" speed for the drive.\nAbove that speed, voltage is held constant, and torque is given by:\n3p\n|V 0|2 R2\nsB\nTe = ωB (X1\n0 + X2)2 + ( R2 )2\nsB\nThe peak of this torque has a square-inverse dependence on frequency, as can be seen from Figure 13.\nInduction Motor Torque\nN-m\nSpeed, RPM\nFigure 13: Idealized Torque-Speed Curves: Zero Stator Resistance\n\nq\nq\n6.4\nPeak Torque Capability\nAssuming we have a smart controller, we are interested in the actual capability of the machine.

This is given by the matching condition:\nR2\nr\nω\ns =\nR1\n02 + ((X1\n0 + X2)( ωB\n))2\nThen maximum (breakdown) torque is given by:\nB\nω\nωB\nB\np\nω V 0 2 R0\n2 + ((X1\n0 + X2)(\n))2\n|\n|\nTmax =\nR02\n((X1\n0 + X2)(\n))2 + (R0\n1 +\n+ ((X1\n0 + X2)(\n))2)2\nThis is plotted in Figure 14. Just as a check, this was calculated assuming R1 = 0, and the\nresults are plotted in figure 15. This plot shows, as one would expect, a constant torque limit region\nto zero speed.\nBreakdown Torque\nDrive Frequency, Hz\nFigure 14: Torque-Capability Curve For An Induction Motor\nNewton-Meters\n6.5\nField Oriented Control\nOne of the more useful impacts of modern power electronics and control technology has enabled\nus to turn induction machines into high performance servomotors. In this note we will develop a\n\nBreakdown Torque\nNewton-Meters\nDrive Frequency, Hz\nFigure 15: Idealized Torque Capability Curve: Zero Stator Resistance\npicture of how this is done. Quite obviously there are many details which we will not touch here.\nThe objective is to emulate the performance of a DC machine, in which (as you will recall), torque\nis a simple function of applied current. For a machine with one field winding, this is simply:\nT = GIfIa\nThis makes control of such a machine quite easy, for once the desired torque is known it is easy to\ntranslate that torque command into a current and the motor does the rest.\nOf course DC (commutator) machines are, at least in large sizes, expensive, not particularly\nefficient, have relatively high maintenance requirements because of the sliding brush/commutator\ninterface, provide environmental problems because of sparking and carbon dust and are environ\nmentally sensitive. The induction motor is simpler and more rugged. Until fairly recently the\ninduction motor has not been widely used in servo applications because it was thought to be \"hard\nto control\". As we will show, it does take a little effort and even some computation to do the\ncontrols right, but this is becoming increasingly affordable.\n6.6\nElementary Model:\nWe return to the elementary model of the induction motor. In ordinary variables, referred to the\nstator, the machine is described by flux-current relationships (in the d-q reference frame):\n\"\n#\n\"\n# \"\n#\nλdS\nLS\nM\nidS\n=\nλdR\nM\nLR\nidR\n\"\n#\n\"\n# \"\n#\nλqS\n=\nLS\nM\niqS\nλqR\nM\nLR\niqR\n\n!\nNote the machine is symmetric (there is no saliency), and since we are referred to the stator,\nthe stator and rotor self-inductances include leakage terms:\nLS\n=\nM + LS`\nLR\n=\nM + LR`\nThe voltage equations are:\ndλdS\nvdS\n=\n-ωλqS + rSidS\ndt\ndλqS\nvqS\n=\n+ ωλdS + rSiqS\ndt\ndλdR\n=\n-ωsλqR + rRidR\ndt\ndλqR\n=\n+ ωsλdR + rRiqR\ndt\nNote that both rotor and stator have \"speed\" voltage terms since they are both rotating with\nrespect to the rotating coordinate system. The speed of the rotating coordinate system is w with\nrespect to the stator. With respect to the rotor that speed is , where wm is the rotor mechanical\nspeed. Note that this analysis does not require that the reference frame coordinate system speed\nw be constant.\nTorque is given by:\nT e =\np (λdSiqS -λqSidS)\n6.7\nSimulation Model\nAs a first step in developing a simulation model, see that the inversion of the flux-current relation\nship is (we use the d- axis since the q- axis is identical):\nLR\nM\nidS\n=\nLSLR -M2 λdS -LSLR -M2 λdR\nM\nLS\nidR\n=\nLSLR -M2 λdS -LSLR -M2 λdR\nNow, if we make the following definitions (the motivation for this should by now be obvious):\nXd\n=\nω0LS\nXkd\n=\nω0LR\nXad\n=\nω0M\nM2\n=\nXd\nω0 LS -LR\nthe currents become:\nω0\nXad ω0\nidS\n=\nXd\n0 λdS -Xkd Xd\n0 λdR\nXad ω0\nXd ω0\nidR\n=\nXkd Xd\n0 λdS -Xd\n0 Xkd\nλdR\n\nThe q- axis is the same.\nTorque may be, with these calculations for current, written as:\nω0Xad\nTe = 2p (λdSiqS -λqSidS) = -2pXkdXd\n0 (λdSλqR -λqSλdR)\nNote that the usual problems with ordinary variables hold here: the foregoing expression was\nwritten assuming the variables are expressed as peak quantities. If RMS is used we must replace\n3/2 by 3!\nWith these, the simulation model is quite straightforward. The state equations are:\ndλdS\ndt\n=\nVdS + ωλqS -RSidS\ndλqS\ndt\n=\nVqS -ωλdS -RSiqS\ndλdR\ndt\n=\nωsλqR -RRidR\ndλqR\ndt\n=\n-ωsλdR -RSiqR\ndΩm\n=\n(Te + Tm)\ndt\nJ\nwhere the rotor frequency (slip frequency) is:\nωs = ω -pΩm\nFor simple simulations and constant excitaion frequency, the choice of coordinate systems is\narbitrary, so we can choose something convenient. For example, we might choose to fix the coordi\nnate system to a synchronously rotating frame, so that stator frequency ω = ω0. In this case, we\ncould pick the stator voltage to lie on one axis or another. A common choice is Vd = 0 and Vq = V .\n6.8\nControl Model\nIf we are going to turn the machine into a servomotor, we will want to be a bit more sophisticated\nabout our coordinate system. In general, the principle of field-oriented control is much like emu\nlating the function of a DC (commutator) machine. We figure out where the flux is, then inject\ncurrent to interact most directly with the flux.\nAs a first step, note that because the two stator flux linkages are the sum of air-gap and leakage\nflux,\nλdS\n=\nλagd + LS`idS\nλqS\n=\nλagq + LS`iqS\nThis means that we can re-write torque as:\nT e =\np (λagdiqS -λagqidS)\n\nNext, note that the rotor flux is, similarly, related to air-gap flux:\nλagd\n=\nλdR -LR`idR\nλagq\n=\nλqR -LR`iqR\nTorque now becomes:\nT e =\npLR` (idRiqS -iqRidS)\np (λdRiqS -λqRidS) -\nNow, since the rotor currents could be written as:\nλdR\nM\nidR\n=\nLR\n-LR\nidS\nλqR\nM\niqR\n=\nLR\n-LR\niqS\nThat second term can be written as:\nidRiqS -iqRidS = LR\n(λdRiqS -λqRidS)\nSo that torque is now:\nLR`\nM\nT e = 2p 1 -LR\n(λdRiqS -λqRidS) = 2 LR\n(λdRiqS -λqRidS)\np\n6.9\nField-Oriented Strategy:\nWhat is done in field-oriented control is to establish a rotor flux in a known position (usually this\nposition is the d- axis of the transformation) and then put a current on the orthogonal axis (where\nit will be most effective in producing torque). That is, we will attempt to set\nλdR\n=\nΛ0\nλqR\n=\nThen torque is produced by applying quadrature-axis current:\nM\nT e =\np\nΛ0iqS\n2 LR\nThe process is almost that simple. There are a few details involved in figuring out where the\nquadrature axis is and how hard to drive the direct axis (magnetizing) current.\nNow, suppose we can succeed in putting flux on the right axis, so that λqR = 0, then the two\nrotor voltage equations are:\n=\ndλdR\ndt -ωsλqR + rRIdR\n=\ndλqR\ndt + ωsλdR + rRIqR\n\nλdR\nM\nidR\n=\nLR\n-\nidS\nLR\nλqR\nM\niqR\n=\nLR\n-\niqS\nLR\n\nZ\nNow, since the rotor currents are:\nThe voltage expressions become, accounting for the fact that there is no rotor quadrature axis\nflux:\ndλdR\nλdR\nM\n=\n+ rR\ndt\nLR\n-LR\nidS\nM\n=\nωsλdR -rR\niqS\nLR\nNoting that the rotor time constant is\nLR\nTR = rR\nwe find:\ndλdR\nTR\n+ λdR\n=\nMidS\ndt\nM iqS\nωs\n=\nTR λdR\nThe first of these two expressions describes the behavior of the direct-axis flux: as one would\nthink, it has a simple first-order relationship with direct-axis stator current. The second expression,\nwhich describes slip as a function of quadrature axis current and direct axis flux, actually describes\nhow fast to turn the rotating coordinate system to hold flux on the direct axis.\nNow, a real machine application involves phase currents ia, ib and ic, and these must be derived\nfrom the model currents idS and iqs. This is done with, of course, a mathematical operation which\nuses a transformation angle θ. And that angle is derived from the rotor mechanical speed and\ncomputed slip:\nθ =\n(pωm + ωs) dt\nA generally good strategy to make this sort of system work is to measure the three phase currents\nand derive the direct- and quadrature-axis currents from them. A good estimate of direct-axis flux is\nmade by running direct-axis flux through a first-order filter. The tricky operation involves dividing\nquadrature axis current by direct axis flux to get slip, but this is now easily done numerically (as\nare the trigonometric operations required for the rotating coordinate system transformation). An\nelmentary block diagram of a (possbly) plausible scheme for this is shown in Figure 16.\nIn this picture we start with commanded values of direct- and quadrature- axis currents, corre\nsponding to flux and torque, respectively. These are translated by a rotating coordinate transfor\nmation into commanded phase currents. That transformation (simply the inverse Park's transform)\nuses the angle q derived as part of the scheme. In some (cheap) implementations of this scheme\nthe commanded currents are used rather than the measured currents to establish the flux and slip.\nWe have shown the commanded currents i∗\na, etc. as inputs to an \"Amplifier\". This might be\nimplemented as a PWM current-source, for example, and a tight loop here results in a rather high\nperformance servo system.\n\nMotor\nLoad\nic\nib\nia\nAmp\no\no\no\nT-1\nT\niq\n*\nid\n*\nic\n*\nib\n*\nia\n*\nM\nSTa\n1 +\nM\nTR\nN÷÷D\nN\nD\nΣ\nωm\nωS\n∫\nθ\nθ\nλdR\nFigure 16: Field Oriented Controller\nReferences\n[1] P.L.

Kirtley Jr.\nIntroduction\nThis note is a review of some of the most salient points of electric network theory. In it we do not\nprove any of the assertions that are made. We deal only with passive, linear network elements.\nNetwork Primitives\nElectric network theory deals with two primitive quantities, which we will refer to as:\n1. Potential (or voltage), and\n2. Current.\nCurrent is the actual flow of charged carriers, while difference in potential is the force that\ncauses that flow. As we will see, potential is a single- valued function that may be uniquely defined\nover the nodes of a network. Current, on the other hand, flows through the branches of the network.\nFigure 1 shows the basic notion of a branch, in which a voltage is defined across the branch and a\ncurrent is defined to flow through the branch. A network is a collection of such elements, connected\ntogether by wires.\ni\n+\nv\n-\nFigure 1: Basic Circuit Element\nNetwork topology is the interconnection of its elements. That, plus the constraints on voltage\nand current imposed by the elements themselves, determines the performance of the network,\ndescribed by the distribution of voltages and currents throughout the network.\nTwo important concepts must be described initially. These are of \"loop\" and \"node\".\n∗2007 James L. Kirtley Jr.\nc\n\nX\nX\n1. A loop in the network is any closed path through two or more elements of the network. Any\nnon-trivial network will have at least one such loop.\ni2\n+\nv\n-\n+\n-\n+\n-\ni\ni\nv\nv\nFigure 2: This is a loop\n2. a node is a point at which two or more elements are interconnected.\ni1\n+\nv1\n-\n-\nv2\n+\ni2\n+\n-\nv3\ni3\nFigure 3: This is a node\nThe two fundamental laws of network theory are known as Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL), and\nKirchoff's Current Law (KCL). These laws describe the topology of the network, and arise directly\nfrom the fundmantal laws of electromagnetics. They are simply stated as:\n- Kirchoff's Voltage Law states that, around any loop of a network, the sum of all voltages,\ntaken in the same direction, is zero:\nvk = 0\n(1)\nloop\n- Kirchoff's Current Law states that, at any node of a network, the sum of all currents entering\nthe node is zero:\nik = 0\n(2)\nnode\n1Note that KVL is a discrete version of Faraday's Law, valid to the extent that no time-varying\nflux links the loop. KCL is just conservation of current, allowing for no accumulation of charge at\nthe node.\n\nNetwork elements affect voltages and currents in one of three ways:\n1. Voltage sources constrain the potential difference across their terminals to be of some fixed\nvalue (the value of the source).\n2. Current sources constrain the current through the branch to be of some fixed value.\n3. All other elements impose some sort of relationship, either linear or nonlinear, between voltage\nacross and current through the branch.\n+\nv\ni\n-\nVoltage\nCurrent\nSource\nSource\nFigure 4: Notation for voltage and current sources\nVoltage and current sources can be either independent or dependent. Independent sources have\nvalues which are, as the name implies, independent of other variables in a circuit.\nDependent\nsources have values which depend on some other variable in a circuit. A common example of a\ndependent source is the equivalent current source used for modeling the collector junction in a\ntransistor. Typically, this is modeled as a current dependent current source, in which collector\ncurrent is taken to be directly dependent on emitter current. Such dependent sources must be\nhandled with some care, for certain tricks we will be discussing below do not work with them.\nFor the present time, we will consider, in addition to voltage and current sources, only impedance\nelements, which impose a linear relationship between voltage and current. The most common of\nthese is the resistance, which imposes the relationship which is often referred to as Ohm's law:\nvr = Rir\n(3)\ni r\n+\nR\nv r\n-\nFigure 5: Resistance Circuit Element\nA bit later on in this note, we will extend this notion of impedance to other elements, but for\nthe moment the resistance will serve our purposes.\n\nExamples: Voltage and Current Dividers\nFigure 6 may be used as an example to show how we use all of this. See that it has one loop and\nthree nodes. Around the loop, KVL is:\nVs -v1 -v2 = 0\nAt the upper right- hand node, we have, by KCL:\ni1 -i2 = 0\nThe constitutive relations imposed by the resistances are:\nv1 = R1i1\nv2 = R2i2\nCombining these, we find that:\nVs = (R1 + R2)i1\nWe may solve for the voltage across, say, R2, to obtain the so-called voltage divider relationship:\nR2\nv2 = Vs\n(4)\nR1 + R2\ni1\n+\n-\n+\n-\nv 1\nv2\ni 2\nv\ns\n+\n-\nR1\nR\nFigure 6: Voltage Divider\nA second example is illustrated by Figure 7. Here, KCL at the top node yields:\nIs -i1 -i2 = 0\nAnd KVL, written around the loop that has the two resistances, is:\nR1i1 -R2i2 = 0\nCombining these together, we have the current divider relationship:\nR1\ni2 = Is\n(5)\nR1 + R2\nOnce we have derived the voltage and current divider relationships, we can use them as part of\nour \"intellectual toolkit\", because they will always be true.\n\nI\n+\n-\n+\n-\nR1\nR2\nv 1\nv2\ni 1\ni 2\ns\nFigure 7: Current Divider\nNode Voltages and Reference\nOne of the consequences of KVL is that every node in a network will have a potential which is\nuniquely specified with respect to some other node. Thus, if we take one of the nodes in the network\nto be a reference, or datum, each of the other nodes will have a unique potential. The voltage across\nany network branch is then the difference between the potentials at the nodes to which the element\nis connected. The potential of a node is the sum of voltages encountered when traversing some\npath between that node and the datum node. Note that any path will do. If KVL is satisfied, all\npaths between each pair of nodes will yield the same potential.\nA commonly used electric circuit is the Wheatstone Bridge, shown in its simplest form in\nFigure 8. The output voltage is found simply from the input voltage as just the difference between\ntwo voltage dividers:\nR2\nR4\nvo = vs\n-\nR1 + R2\nR3 + R4\nThis circuit is used in situations in which one or more resistors varies with, say temperature or\nmechanical strain. The bridge can be balanced so that the output voltage is zero by adjusting one\nof the other resistors. Then relatively small variations in the sensing element can result in relatively\nbig differences in the output voltage. If, for example R2 is the sensing element, R4 can be adjusted\nto balance the bridge.\nSerial and Parallel Combinations\nThere are a number of techniques for handling network problems, and we will not be able to\ninvestigate each of them in depth. We will, however, look into a few techniques for analysis which\ninvolve progressive simplification of the network. To start, we consider how one might handle series\nand parallel combinations of elements. A pair of elements is in series if the same current flows\nthrough both of them. If these elements are resistors and if the detail of voltage division between\nthem is not required, it is possible to lump the two together as a single resistance. This is illustrated\nin Figure 9. The voltage across the current source is:\nvs = v1 + v2 = isR1 + isR2 = is(R1 + R2)\nThe equivalent resistance for the series combination is then:\nRseries = R1 + R2\n(6)\n\n+\n-\nv 1\n+\ni\nR1\nR2\nv2\ns\nv s\n-\n-\ni2\n+\n\n+\nR1\nv 1\nR3\ns\n\n-\n\nv o\n\n+\nR2\nv 3\nR4\n-\n+\nFigure 8: Wheatstone Bridge\nv3\n+\n-\nv\n-\n+\nv 4\n-\nFigure 9: Series Resistance Combination\nSimilarly, resistance elements connected in parallel can be lumped if it is not necessary to know\nthe details of division of current between them. Figure 10 shows this combination.\nHere, current i is simply:\nv\nv\ni =\n+\n= v\n+\nR1\nR2\nR1\nR2\nThe equivalent resistance for the parallel combination is then:\nR1R2\nRpar =\n1 =\n(7)\n+\nR1 + R2\nR1\nR2\nBecause of the importance of parallel connection of resistances (and of other impedances), a special\nsymbolic form is used for parallel construction. This is:\nR1R2\nR1||R2 =\n(8)\nR1 + R2\nAs an example, consider the circuit shown in Figure 11, part (a). Here, we have four, resistors\narranged in an odd way to form a two- terminal network. To find the equivalent resistance of this\nthing, we can do a series of series-parallel combinations.\nThe two resistors on the right can be combined as a series combination to form a single, two\nohm resistor as shown in part (b). Then the equivalent resistor, which is in parallel with one of the\n\nSeries\nParrallel\nSeries\n(a)\n(b)\nComb\n(c)\nComb\n(d)\nComb\nFigure 11: Series-Parallel Reduction\nI\n-\n+\n-\n+\n-\nR1\nR2\nv 1\nv2\ni 1\ni 2\nv\n+\nFigure 10: Parallel Resistance Combination\ntwo ohm resistors can be combined to form a single combination part(c). That is in series with the\nremaining resistor, leaving us with an equivalent input resistance of R = 3Ω.\nLoop and Node Equations\nThere are two well- developed formal ways of solving for the potentials and currents in networks,\noften referred to as loop and node equation methods. They are closely related, using KCL and\nKVL together with element constraints to build sets of equations which may then be solved for\npotentials and currents.\n- In the node equation method, KCL is written at each node of the network, with currents\nexpressed in terms of the node potentials. KVL is satisfied because the node potentials are\nunique.\n- In the loop equation method, KVL is written about a collection of closed paths in the network.\n\"Loop currents\" are defined, and made to satisfy KCL, and the branch voltages are expressed\nin terms of them.\nThe two methods are equivalent and a choice between them is usually a matter of personal prefer\nence. The node equation method is probably more widely used, and lends itself well to computer\nanalysis.\nTo illustrate how these methods work, consider the network of Figure 12.\nThis network has three nodes. We are going to write KCL for each of the nodes, but note that\nonly two explicit equations are required. If KCL is satisfied at two of the nodes, it is automatically\nsatisfied at the third. Usually the datum node is the one for which we do not write the expression.\n\ni1\nR2\n-\nI\nV\n+\n-\nR1\nR\nv\n+\nFigure 12: Sample Network\nKCL written for the two upper nodes of the network is:\nV\nV -v2\n+\n=\n(9)\n-i1 + R1\nR2\nv2 -V\nv2\n-I +\n+\n=\n(10)\nR2\nR3\nThese two expressions are easily solved for the two unknowns, i1 and v2:\nR3\nR2R3\nv2 =\nV +\nI\nR2 + R3\nR2 + R3\nR1 + R2 + R3\nR3\ni1 =\nV -\nI\nR1(R2 + R3)\nR2 + R3\nb\nI\nV\n+\n-\ni 1\nR1\nR2\nR\nv\n+\n-\nia\ni\nFigure 13: Sample Network Showing Loops\nThe loop equation method is similar. We need the same number of independent expressions\n(two), so we need to take two independent loops.\nFor this, take as the loops as is shown in\nFigure 13:\n1. The loop that includes the voltage source and R1.\n2. The loop that includes R1, R2, and R3.\nIt is also necessary to define loop currents, which we will denote as ia and ib. These are the currents\ncirculating around the two loops. Note that where the loops intersect, the actual branch current\nwill be the sum of or difference between loop currents. For this example, assume the loop currents\nare defined to be circulating counter-clockwise in the two loops. The two loop equations are:\nV + R1(ia -ib)\n=\n(11)\nR1(ib -ia) + R2ib + R3(ib -I)\n=\n(12)\nThese are equally easily solved for the two unknowns, in this case the two loop currents ia and ib.\n\nLinearity and Superposition\nAn extraordinarily powerful notion of network theory is linearity. This property has two essential\nelements, stated as follows:\n1. For any single input x yielding output y, the response to an input kx is ky for any value of k.\n2. If, in a multi-input network the input x1 by itself yields output y1 and a second input x2 by\nitself yields y2, then the combination of inputs x1 and x2 yields the output y = y1 + y2.\nThis is important to us at the present moment for two reasons:\n1. It tells us that the solution to certain problems involving networks with multiple inputs is\nactually easier than we might expect: if a network is linear, we may solve for the output with\neach separate input, then add the outputs. This is called superposition.\n2. It also tells us that, for networks that are linear, it is not necessary to actually consider the\nvalue of the inputs in calculating response. What is important is a system function, or a ratio\nof output to input.\nSuperposition is an important principle when dealing with linear networks, and can be used\nto make analysis easier. If a network has multiple independent sources, it is possible to find the\nresponse to each source separately, then add up all of the responses to find total response. Note\nthat this can only be done with independent sources!\nConsider, for example, the example circuit shown in Figure 12. If we are only interested in the\noutput voltage v2, we may find the response to the voltage source first, then the response to the\ncurrent source, then the total response is the sum of the two. To find the response to the voltage\nsource, we must \"turn off\" the current source. This is done by assuming that it is not there. (After\nall, a current source with zero current is just an open circuit!). The resulting network is as in\nFigure 14.\nR2\n2v\nV\n+\n-\nR\nv\n+\n-\nFigure 14: Superposition Fragment: Voltage Source\nNote that the resistance R1 does not appear here. This is because a resistance in parallel with\na voltage source is just a voltage source, unless one is interested in current in the resistance. The\noutput voltage is just:\nR3\nv2v = V R2 + R3\nNext, we \"turn off\" the voltage source and \"turn on\" the current source. Note that a voltage source\nthat has been turned off is a short circuit, because that implies zero voltage. The network is as\nshown in Figure 15\n\nR2\nI\n+\nR\nv\n2i\n-\nFigure 15: Superposition Fragment: Current Source\nThe response to this is:\nv2i = IR2||R3\nThe total response is then just:\nR3\nR2R3\nv2 = v2v + v2i = V\n+ I\nR2 + R3\nR2 + R3\nThevenin and Norton Equivalent Circuits\nA particularly important ramification of the property of linearity is expressed in the notion of\nequivalent circuits. To wit: if we are considering the response of a network at any given terminal\npair, that is a pair of nodes that have been brought out to the outside world, it follows from the\nproperties of linearity that, if the network is linear, the output at a single terminal pair (either\nvoltage or current) is the sum of two components:\n1. The response that would exist if the excitation at the terminal pair were zero and\n2. The response forced at the terminal pair by the exciting voltage or current.\nThis notion may be expressed with either voltage or current as the response. These yield the\nThevenin and Norton equivalent networks, which are exactly equivalent. At any terminal pair, the\nproperties of a linear network may be expressed in terms of either Thevenin or Norton equivalents.\nThe Thevenin equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 16, while the Norton equivalent circuit is shown\nin Figure 17.\ni\n+\nRth\n+\nv\nV th\n-\n-\nFigure 16: Thevenin Equivalent Network\n\ni\n+\nv\nReq\n-\nIn\nFigure 17: Norton Equivalent Network\nThe Thevenin and Norton equivalent networks have the same impedance. Further, the equiva\nlent sources are related by the simple relationship:\nVTh = ReqIN\n(13)\nThe Thevenin Equivalent Voltage, the source internal to the Thevenin equivalent network, is\nthe same as the open circuit voltage, which is the voltage that would appear at the terminals of\nthe equivalent circuit were it to be open circuited. Similarly, the Norton Equivalent Current is the\nsame as minus the short circuit current.\nTo consider how we might use these equivalent networks, consider what would happen if the\nWheatstone bridge were connected by some resistance across its output, as shown in Figure 18\n-\n+\n-\n+\n-\nR1\nv 1\n+\n-\n+\n-\nv o\nR\nR\nv\nv\nR3\nv3\nv\ns\n+\n-\nR5\n+\nFigure 18: Wheatstone Bridge With Output Resistance\nThe analysis of this situation is simplified substantially if one recognizes that each side of the\nbridge can be expressed as either a Thevenin or Norton equivalent network. We may proceed to\nsolve the problem by finding the equivalent networks for each side, then paste them together to\nform the whole solution. So: consider the equivalent network for the left-hand side of the network,\nformed by the elements V , R1 and R2. This is shown in Figure 19.\n\nR1\n+\nRTh l\nV\n+\n-\nR2\nVTh l\n-\n\nFigure 19: Construction of Equivalent Circuit\nWhere, here, the components of the equivalent circuit are:\nR2\nvThl =\nV R1 + R2\nReql =\nR1||R2\nSimilarly, the right side of the network is found to have an equivalent source and resistance:\nR4\nvThr =\nV R3 + R4\nReqr\n=\nR3||R4\nAnd the whole thing behaves as the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 20\nRTh l\nR5\nR Th r\n+\n+\nVTh l\nVTh r\n-\n-\nFigure 20: Equivalent Circuit\nThis is, of course, easily solved for the current through, and hence the voltage across, the\nresistance R5, which was desired in the first place:\nR5\nR2\nR5\nv5 = (vThl -vThr)\n= V\n-fracR4R3 + R4\nR5 + reql + reqr\nR1 + R2\nR5 + R1||R2 + R3||R4\nTwo Port Networks\nSo far, we have dealt with a number of networks which may be said to be one port or single-terminal\npair circuits. That is, the important action occurs at a single terminal pair, and is characterized\nby an impedance and by either a open circuit voltage or a short circuit current, thus forming either\na Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit. A second, and for us very important, class of electrical\nnetwork has two (or sometimes more) terminal pairs. We will consider formally here the two port\nnetwork, illustrated schematically in Figure 21.\nThere are a number of ways of characterizing this type of network. For the time being, consider\nthat it is passive, so that there is no output without some input and there are no dependent sources.\n\n\"\n#\n\"\n# \"\n#\n\"\n#\n\"\n# \"\n#\n\"\n#\n\"\n# \"\n#\ni\nv 2\ni2\n+\n-\n+\n-\nv\nFigure 21: Two-Port Network\nThen we may characterize the network in terms of the currents at its terminals in terms of the\nvoltages, or, conversely, we may describe the voltages in terms of the currents at the terminals.\nThese two ways of describing the network are said to be the admittance or impedance parameters.\nThese may be written in the following way:\nThe impedance parameter point of view would yield, for a resistive network, the following\nrelationship between voltages and currents:\nv1\nR11 R12\ni1\n=\n(14)\nv2\nR21 R22\ni2\nSimilarly, the admittance parameter point of view would yield a similar relationship:\ni1\nG11 G12\nv1\n=\n(15)\ni2\nG21 G22\nv2\nThese two relationships are, of course, the inverses of each other. That is:\n\"\n#\n\"\n#-1\nG11 G12\nR11 R12\n=\n(16)\nG21 G22\nR21 R22\nIf the networks are linear and passive (i.e. there are no dependent sources inside), they also\nexhibit the property of reciprocity. In a reciprocal network, the transfer impedance or transfer\nadmittance is the same in both directions. That is:\nR12 =\nR21\nG12 =\nG21\n(17)\nIt is often useful to express two- port networks in terms of T or Π networks, shown in Figures 22\nand 23.\nSometimes it is useful to cascade two-port networks, as is shown in Figure 24. The resulting\ncombination is itself a two-port.

The expressions which are used to calculate what these\nelements are doing are algebraic (and for most elements are linear too). As it turns out, much of\nthe circuitry we will be studying can be so characterized, with complex parameters.\nHowever, we take a quick diversion to discuss briefly the transient behavior of circuits containing\ncapacitors and inductors.\n\ni1\n+\nv 1\n-\ni2\ni3\n+\n+\nv 2\nv 3\n-\n-\ni4\n+\nv 4\n-\nFigure 24: Cascade of Two-Port Networks\nic\nvc\nil\nvl\nC\nL\nFigure 25: Capacitance and Inductance\nSymbols for capacitive and inductive circuit elements are shown in Figure 25. They are char\nacterized by the relationships between voltage and current:\nic = C dvc\ndt\nv` = L di`\ndt\n(18)\nNote that, while these elements are linear, since time derivatives are involved in their char\nacterization, expressions describing their behavior in networks will become ordinary differential\nequations.\n10.1\nSimple Case: R-C\nr\nC\nR\n+\nv\n-\nic\ni\nFigure 26: Simple Case: R-C\nFigure 26 shows a simple connection of a resistance and a capacitance. This circuit has only\ntwo nodes, so there is a single voltage v across both elements. The two elements produce the\nconstraints:\nv\nir =\nR\ndv\nic =\ndt\n\n(\nand, since ir = -ic,\ndv\n+\nv = 0\ndt\nRC\nNow, we know that this sort of first-order, linear equation is solved by:\nt\nv ∼ e -RC\n(To confirm this, just substitute the exponential into the differential equation.) Then, if we have\nsome initial condition, say v(t = 0) = V0, then\nt\nv = V0e -RC\nThis was a trivial case, since we don't describe how that initial condition might have taken\nplace. But consider a closely related problem, illustrated in Figure 27.\n10.2\nSimple Case with Drive\nR\n-\nC\nvc\n+\n-\nv s\n+\nFigure 27: RC Circuit with Drive\nThe analysis of this circuit is accomplished by noting that it contains a single loop, and adding\nup the voltages around the loop we find:\ndvc\nRC\n+ vc = vs\ndt\nNow, assume that the voltage source is a step:\nvs = Vsu-1(t)\nWe should define the step function with some care, since it is of quite a lot of use. The step is\none of a hierarchy of singularity functions. It is defined as:\nt < 0\nu-1(t) =\n(19)\nt > 0\nNow, remembering that differential equations have particular and homogeneous solutions, and\nthat for t > 0 a particular solution which solves the differential equation is:\nvcp = V\n\nh\ni\nOf course this does not satisfy the initial condition which is that the capacitance be uncharged:\nvc(t = 0+) = 0. Again, remember that the whole solution is the sum of the particular and a\nhomogeneous solution, and that the homogeneous solution is the un-driven case. To satisfy the\ninitial condition, the homogeneous solution must be:\nt\ncch = -V e -RC\nSo that the total solution is simply:\nt\nvc = V\n1 -e -RC\nNext, suppose vs = u-1(t)V cos ωt. We know the homogeneous solution must be of the same\nform, but the particular solution is a bit more complicated. In later chapters we will learn how to\nmake the process of extracting the particular solution easier, but for the time being, let's assume\nthat with a sinusoidal drive we will get a sinusoidal response of the same frequency. Thus we will\nguess\nvcp = Vcp cos (ωt -φ)\nThe time derivative is\ndvcp = ωVcp sin (ωt -φ)\ndt\nso that we can find an algebraic equation for the particular solution:\nV cos ωt = Vcp (cos (ωt -φ) + ωRC sin (ωt -φ))\nNote the trigonometric identities:\ncos (ωt -φ)\n=\ncos φ cos ωt + sin φ sin ωt\nsin (ωt -φ)\n=\n-sin φ cos ωt + cos φ sin ωt\nSince the sine and cosine terms are orthogonal, we can equate coefficients of sine and cosine to\nget:\nV\n=\nVcp [cos φ + ωRC sin φ]\n=\nVcp [sin φ + ωRC cos φ]\nThe second of these can be solved for the phase angle:\nφ = tan-1 ωRC\nand squaring both equations and adding:\nV 2 = Vcp\n2 1 + (ωRC)2\nso that the particular solution is:\nV\nvcp = q\ncos (ωt -φ)\n1 + (ωRC)2\nFinally, if the capacitor is initially uncharged (vc(t = 0+) = 0), we can add in the homogeneous\nsolution (we already know the form of this), and find the total solution to be:\nV\nt\nvcp = q\ncos (ωt -φ) -cos φe-RC\n1 + (ωRC)2\nThis is shown in Figure 28\n\nR=1, C=1, OM = 10\nVcp\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1\n-1.2\n0.5\n1.5\n2.5\n3.5\n4.5\nt\nFigure 28: Output Voltage for RC Example\n10.3\nSecond-Order System Example\nR1\nR2\nv s\n+\n-\nvo\n-\n+\nL\nL\ni\ni\nFigure 29: Two-Inductor Circuit\nFigure 29 shows a network with two inductances and two resistances.\nAssume that this is\ndriven by a voltage step: vs = Vsu-1(t). Note that, with two inductances, we will require two\ninitial conditions to complete the solution.\nThe steady state (particular) solution is vo = 0. There will, of course, be current flowing in\neach of the inductances, but if excitation is constant there will be no time derivative of current so\nthat voltage across each of the inductances will eventually fall to zero.\nThe initial conditions may be found by inspection. Right after t = 0 (note we use t = 0+ for\nthis), output voltage must be:\nvo(t = 0+) = Vs\nThis must be so since current cannot be made to flow instantaneously in either inductance, so that\nthere is no current in either resistance.\n\n\"\n# \"\n#\n\"\n#\nThe second initial condition is the rate of change of voltage right after the instant of the voltage\nstep.

Kirtley Jr.\nIntroduction\nVirtually all electric machines, and all practical electric machines employ some form of rotating\nor alternating field/current system to produce torque.\nWhile it is possible to produce a \"true\nDC\" machine (e.g. the \"Faraday Disk\"), for practical reasons such machines have not reached\napplication and are not likely to. In the machines we have examined so far the machine is operated\nfrom an alternating voltage source. Indeed, this is one of the principal reasons for employing AC\nin power systems.\nThe first electric machines employed a mechanical switch, in the form of a carbon brush/commutator\nsystem, to produce this rotating field. While the widespread use of power electronics is making\n\"brushless\" motors (which are really just synchronous machines) more popular and common, com\nmutator machines are still economically very important. They are relatively cheap, particularly in\nsmall sizes, they tend to be rugged and simple.\nYou will find commutator machines in a very wide range of applications. The starting motor\non all automobiles is a series-connected commutator machine. Many of the other electric motors in\nautomobiles, from the little motors that drive the outside rear-view mirrors to the motors that drive\nthe windshield wipers are permanent magnet commutator machines. The large traction motors\nthat drive subway trains and diesel/electric locomotives are DC commutator machines (although\ninduction machines are making some inroads here). And many common appliances use \"universal\"\nmotors: series connected commutator motors adapted to AC.\n1.1\nGeometry:\nA schematic picture (\"cartoon\") of a commutator type machine is shown in 1. The armature of\nthis machine is on the rotor (this is the part that handles the electric power), and current is fed to\nthe armature through the brush/commutator system. The interaction magnetic field is provided\n∗ c2003 James L. Kirtley Jr.\n\nStator Yoke\nField Poles\nField Winding\nArmature Winding\nRotor\nΩ\nFigure 1: Wound-Field DC Machine Geometry\n(in this picture) by a field winding. A permanent magnet field is applicable here, and we will have\nquite a lot more to say about such arrangements below.\nNow, if we assume that the interaction magnetic flux density averages Br, and if there are Ca\nconductors underneath the poles at any one time, and if there are m parallel paths, then we may\nestimate torque produced by the machine by:\nCa R`BrIa\nTe = m\nwhere R and ` are rotor radius and length, respectively and Ia is terminal current. Note that Ca\nis not necessarily the total number of conductors, but rather the total number of active conductors\n(that is, conductors underneath the pole and therefore subject to the interaction field). Now, if we\nnote Nf as the number of field turns per pole, the interaction field is just:\nNfIf\nBr =\ng\nleading to a simple expression for torque in terms of the two currents:\nTe = GIaIf\nwhere G is now the motor coefficient (units of N-m/ampere squared):\nCa Nf\nG = μ0\nR`\nm g\nNow, let's go back and look at this from the point of view of voltage. Start with Faraday's Law:\n∂B~\nr × E~ = - ∂t\nIntegrating both sides and noting that the area integral of a curl is the edge integral of the\nquantity, we find:\nI\nZZ\n∂B~\nE~ · d` = -\n∂t\n\nNow, that is a bit awkward to use, particularly in the case we have here in which the edge of\nthe contour is moving (note we will be using this expression to find voltage). We can make this a\nbit more convenient to use if we note:\nwhere v' is the velocity of the contour. This gives us a convenient way of noting the apparent electric\nfield within a moving object (as in the conductors in a DC machine):\nFigure 2: Motion of a contour through a magnetic field produces flux change and electric field in\nthe moving contour\nNow, note that the armature conductors are moving through the magnetic field produced by\nthe stator (field) poles, and we can ascribe to them an axially directed electric field:\nIf the armature conductors are arranged as described above, with Ca conductors in m parallel\npaths underneath the poles and with a mean active radial magnetic field of B,, we can compute a\nvoltage induced in the stator conductors:\nNote that this is only the voltage induced by motion of the armature conductors through the\nfield and does not include brush or conductor resistance. If we include the expression for effective\nmagnetic field, we find that the back voltage is:\nwhich leads us to the conclusion that newton-meters per ampere squared equals volt seconds per\nampere. This stands to reason if we examine electric power into the interaction and mechanical\npower out:\nPe, = EbIa= TeR\n\nNow, a more complete model of this machine would include the effects of armature, brush and\nlead resistance, so that in steady state operation:\nVa = RaIa + GΩIf\nNow, consider this machine with its armatucre connected to a voltage source and its field\noperating at steady current, so that:\nVa -GΩIf\nIa =\nRa\nG I f\nΩ\n+\nVa\n-\nRa\n+\n-\nFigure 3: DC Machine Equivalent Circuit\nThen torque, electric power in and mechanical power out are:\nTe\n=\nGIf\nVa -GΩIf\nRa\nPe\n=\nVa\nVa -GΩIf\nRa\nPm\n=\nGΩIf\nVa -GΩIf\nRa\nNow, note that these expressions define three regimes defined by rotational speed. The two\n\"break points\" are at zero speed and at the \"zero torque\" speed:\nVa\nΩ0 = GIf\nFor 0 < Ω < Ω0, the machine is a motor: electric power in and mechanical power out are both\npositive. For higher speeds: Ω0 < Ω , the machine is a generator, with electrical power in and\nmechanical power out being both negative. For speeds less than zero, electrical power in is positive\nand mechanical power out is negative. There are few needs to operate machines in this regime,\nshort of some types of \"plugging\" or emergency braking in tractions systems.\n1.2\nHookups:\nWe have just described a mode of operation of a commutator machine usually called \"separately\nexcited\", in which field and armature circuits are controlled separately. This mode of operation is\nused in some types of traction applications in which the flexibility it affords is useful. For example,\n\nMechanical\nElectrical\nFigure 4: DC Machine Operating Regimes\nG I f\nΩ\nRa\n+\n-\nFigure 5: Two-Chopper, separately excited machine hookup\nsome traction applications apply voltage control in the form of \"choppers\" to separately excited\nmachines.\nNote that the \"zero torque speed\" is dependend on armature voltage and on field current.\nFor high torque at low speed one would operate the machine with high field current and enough\narmature voltage to produce the requisite current. As speed increases so does back voltage, and\nfield current may need to be reduced. At any steady operating speed there will be some optimum\nmix of field and armature currents to produced the required torque. For braking one could (and this\nis often done) re-connect the armature of the machine to a braking resistor and turn the machine\ninto a generator. Braking torque is controlled by field current.\nA subset of the separately excited machine is the shunt connection in which armature and field\nare supplied by the same source, in parallel. This connection is not widely used any more: it does\nnot yield any meaningful ability to control speed and the simple applications to which is used to\nbe used are mostly being handled by induction machines.\n\n+\nV\n\nFigure 6: Series Connection\nAnother connection which is still widely used in the series connection, in which the field winding\nis sized so that its normal operating current level is the same as normal armature current and the\ntwo windings are connected in series. Then:\nV\nIa = If = Ra + Rf + GΩ\nAnd then torque is:\nGV 2\nTe =\n(Ra + Rf + GΩ)2\nIt is important to note that this machine has no \"zero-torque\" speed, leading to the possibility\nthat an unloaded machine might accelerate to dangerous speeds. This is particularly true because\nthe commutator, made of pieces of relatively heavy material tied together with non- conductors, is\nnot very strong.\nSpeed control of series connected machines can be achieved with voltage control and many\nappliances using this type of machine use choppers or phase control. An older form of control\nused in traction applications was the series dropping resistor: obviously not a very efficient way of\ncontrolling the machine and not widely used (except in old equipment, of course).\nA variation on this class of machine is the very widely used \"universal motor\", in which the stator\nand rotor (field and armature) of the machine are both constructed to operate with alternating\ncurrent. This means that both the field and armature are made of laminated steel. Note that such\na machine will operate just as it would have with direct current, with the only addition being the\nreactive impedance of the two windings. Working with RMS quantities:\nV\nI =\nRa + Rf + GΩ + jω (La + Lf)\n|V |2\nTe\n=\n(Ra + Rf + GΩ)2 + (ωLa + ωLf)2\nwhere ω is the electrical supply frequency. Note that, unlike other AC machines, the universal\nmotor is not limited in speed to the supply frequency. Appliance motors typically turn substantially\nfaster than the 3,600 RPM limit of AC motors, and this is one reason why they are so widely used:\nwith the high rotational speeds it is possible to produce more power per unit mass (and more power\nper dollar).\n\n1.3\nCommutator:\nThe commutator is what makes this machine work. The brush and commutator system of this\nclass of motor involves quite a lot of \"black art\", and there are still aspects of how they work\nwhich are poorly understood. However, we can make some attempt to show a bit of what the\nbrush/commutator system does.\nTo start, take a look at the picture shown in Figure 7. Represented are a pair of poles (shaded)\nand a pair of brushes. Conductors make a group of closed paths. Current from one of the brushes\ntakes two parallel paths. You can follow one of those paths around a closed loop, under each of\nthe two poles (remember that the poles are of opposite polarity) to the opposite brush. Open\ncommutator segments (most of them) do not carry current into or out of the machine.\nFigure 7: Commutator and Current Paths\nA commutation interval occurs when the current in one coil must be reversed. (See Figure 8\nIn the simplest form this involves a brush bridging between two commutator segments, shorting\nout that coil. The resistance of the brush causes the current to decay. When the brush leaves the\nleading segment the current in the leading coil must reverse.\nFigure 8: Commutator at Commutation\nWe will not attempt to fully understand the commutation process in this type of machine, but\nwe can note a few things. Resistive commutation is the process relied upon in small machines.\n\nWhen the current in one coil must be reversed (because it has left one pole and is approaching the\nother), that coil is shorted by one of the brushes. The brush resistance causes the current in the\ncoil to decay. Then the leading commutator segment leaves the brush the current MUST reverse\n(the trailing coil has current in it), and there is often sparking.\n1.4\nCommutation\nCommutation\nStator Yoke\nField Poles\nField Winding\nArmature Winding\nRotor\nΩ\nInterpoles\nFigure 9: Commutation Interpoles\nIn larger machines the commutation process would involve too much sparking, which causes\nbrush wear, noxious gases (ozone) that promote corrosion, etc. In these cases it is common to use\nseparate commutation interpoles. These are separate, usually narrow or seemingly vestigal pole\npieces which carry armature current. They are arranged in such a way that the flux from the\ninterpole drives current in the commutated coil in the proper direction. Remember that the coil\nbeing commutated is located physically between the active poles and the interpole is therefore in the\nright spot to influence commutation. The interpole is wound with armature current (it is in series\nwith the main brushes). It is easy to see that the interpole must have a flux density proportional\nto the current to be commutated. Since the speed with which the coil must be commutated is\nproportional to rotational velocity and so is the voltage induced by the interpole, if the right\nnumber of turns are put around the interpole, commutation can be made to be quite accurate.\n1.5\nCompensation:\nThe analysis of commutator machines often ignores armature reaction flux. Obviously these ma\nchines DO produce armature reaction flux, in quadrature with the main field. Normally, commuta\ntor machines are highly salient and the quadrature inductance is lower than direct-axis inductance,\nbut there is still flux produced. This adds to the flux density on one side of the main poles (pos\nsibly leading to saturation). To make the flux distribution more uniform and therefore to avoid\nthis saturation effect of quadrature axis flux, it is common in very highly rated machines to wind\ncompensation coils: essentially mirror-images of the armature coils, but this time wound in slots\nin the surface of the field poles. Such coils will have the same number of ampere-turns as the\n\nRotor\nCommutation\nInterpoles\nPole-Face\nCompensation\nWinding\nField Poles\nField Winding\nArmature Winding\nΩ\nFigure 10: Pole Face Compensation Winding\narmature. Normally they have the same number of turns and are connected directly in series with\nthe armature brushes. What they do is to almost exactly cancel the flux produced by the armature\ncoils, leaving only the main flux produced by the field winding. One might think of these coils as\nproviding a reaction torque, produced in exactly the same way as main torque is produced by the\narmature. A cartoon view of this is shown in Figure 10.\nPermanent Magnets in Electric Machines\nOf all changes in materials technology over the last several years, advances in permanent magnets\nhave had the largest impact on electric machines. Permanent magnets are often suitable as replace\nments for the field windings in machines: that is they can produce the fundamental interaction\nfield. This does three things. First, since the permanent magnet is lossless it eliminates the energy\nrequired for excitation, usually improving the efficiency of the machine. Second, since eliminating\nthe excitation loss reduces the heat load it is often possible to make PM machines more compact.\nFinally, and less appreciated, is the fact that modern permanent magnets have very large coercive\nforce densities which permit vastly larger air gaps than conventional field windings, and this in turn\npermits design flexibility which can result in even better electric machines.\nThese advantages come not without cost. Permanent magnet materials have special character\nistics which must be taken into account in machine design. The highest performance permanent\nmagnets are brittle ceramics, some have chemical sensitivities, all are sensitive to high temperatures,\nmost have sensitivity to demagnetizing fields, and proper machine design requires understanding\nthe materials well. These notes will not make you into seasoned permanent magnet machine de\nsigners. They are, however, an attempt to get started, to develop some of the mathematical skills\n\nrequired and to point to some of the important issues involved.\n2.1\nPermanent Magnets:\nHysteresis Loop: Permanent Magnet\n-1\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n-400\n-300\n-200\n-100\nKilo Am peres/Meter\nTesla\nFigure 11: Hysteresis Loop Of Ceramic Permanent Magnet\nPermanent magnet materials are, at core, just materials with very wide hysteresis loops. Fig\nure 11 is an example of something close to one of the more popular ceramic magnet materials.Note\nthat this hysteresis loop is so wide that you can see the effect of the permeability of free space.\nFigure 12: Demagnetization Curve\nIt is usual to display only part of the magnetic characteristic of permanent magnet materials\n(see Figure 12), the third quadrant of this picture, because that is where the material is normally\nDemagnetization Curve\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\n0.45\n0.5\n-250\n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\nH, kA/m\nB, Tesla\nBr\nEnergy Product Loci\nHc\n\nI\noperated. Note a few important characteristics of what is called the \"demagnetization curve\". The\nremanent flux density Br, is the value of flux density in the material with zero magnetic field H.\nThe coercive field Hc is the magnetic field at which the flux density falls to zero. Shown also on\nthe curve are loci of constant energy product. This quantity is unfortunately named, for although\nit has the same units as energy it represents real energy in only a fairly general sense. It is the\nproduct of flux density and field intensity. As you already know, there are three commonly used\nsystems of units for magnetic field quantities, and these systems are often mixed up to form very\nconfusing units. We will try to stay away from the English system of units in which field intensity\nH is measured in amperes per inch and flux density B in lines (actually, usually kilolines) per\nsquare inch. In CGS units flux density is measured in Gauss (or kilogauss) and magnetic field\nintensity in Oersteds. And in SI the unit of flux density is the Tesla, which is one Weber per square\nmeter, and the unit of field intensity is the Ampere per meter. Of these, only the last one, A/m is\nobvious. A Weber is a volt-second. A Gauss is 10-4 Tesla. And, finally, an Oersted is that field\nintensity required to produce one Gauss in the permeability of free space. Since the permeability\nof free space μ0 = 4π × 10-7Hy/m, this means that one Oe is about 79.58 A/m. Commonly, the\nenergy product is cited in MgOe (Mega-Gauss-Oersted)s. One MgOe is equal to 7.958kJ/m3 . A\ncommonly used measure for the performance of a permanent magnet material is the maximum\nenergy product, the largest value of this product along the demagnetization curve.\nTo start to understand how these materials might be useful, consider the situation shown in\nFigure 13: A piece of permanent magnet material is wrapped in a magnetic circuit with effectively\ninfinite permeability. Assume the thing has some (finite) depth in the direction you can't see. Now,\nif we take Ampere's law around the path described by the dotted line,\nH~ · d~` = 0\nsince there is no current anywhere in the problem. If magnetization is upwards, as indicated by\nthe arrow, this would indicate that the flux density in the permanent magnet material is equal to\nthe remanent flux density (also upward).\nMagnetic Circuit, μ→inf\nPermanent Magnet\nFigure 13: Permanent Magnet in Magnetic Circuit\nA second problem is illustrated in Figure 14, in which the same magnet is embedded in a\n\nZZ\n\nmagnetic circuit with an air gap. Assume that the gap has width g and area Ag. The magnet has\nheight hm and area Am. For convenience, we will take the positive reference direction to be up (as\nwe see it here) in the magnet and down in the air-gap.\nMagnetic Circuit, μ→inf\nPermanent Magnet\ng\nhm\nFigure 14: Permanent Magnet Driving an Air-Gap\nThus we are following the same reference direction as we go around the Ampere's Law loop.\nThat becomes:\nI\nH~ · d ~` = Hmhm + Hgg\nNow, Gauss' law could be written for either the upper or lower piece of the magnetic circuit.\nAssuming that the only substantive flux leaving or entering the magnetic circuit is either in the\nmagnet or the gap:\n\nB~ · d A~ = BmAm -μ0HgAg\nSolving this pair we have:\nAg hm\nBm = -μ0\nHm = μ0PuHm\nAm g\nThis defines the unit permeance, essentially the ratio of the permeance facing the permanent\nmagnet to the internal permeance of the magnet. The problem can be, if necessary, solved graph\nically, since the relationship between Bm and Hm is inherently nonlinear, as shown in Figure 15\n\"load line\" analysis of a nonlinear electronic circuit.\nNow, one more 'cut' at this problem. Note that, at least for fairly large unit permeances the\nslope of the magnet characteristic is fairly constant. In fact, for most of the permanent magnets\nused in machines (the one important exception is the now rarely used ALNICO alloy magnet), it\nis generally acceptable to approximate the demagnitization curve with:\nB~m = μm H~ m + M~ 0\nHere, the magnetization M0 is fixed. Further, for almost all of the practical magnet materials\nthe magnet permeability is nearly the same as that of free space (μm ≈ μ0). With that in mind,\n\n-\n℘\nμ 0\nu\nFigure 15: Load Line, Unit Permeance Analysis\nconsider the problem shown in Figure 16, in which the magnet fills only part of a gap in a magnetic\ncircuit. But here the magnet and gap areas are essentially the same. We could regard the magnet\nas simply a magnetization.\nPermanent Magnet\nMagnetic Circuit, μ→inf\nFigure 16: Surface Magnet Primitive Problem\nIn the region of the magnet and the air-gap, Ampere's Law and Gauss' law can be written:\nr × H~\n=\nr · μ0 H~ m + M~ 0\n=\nr · μ0H~ g\n=\nNow, if in the magnet the magnetization is constant, the divergence of H in the magnet is zero.\nBecause there is no current here, H is curl free, so that everywhere:\nH~\n=\n-rψ\nr2ψ =\nThat is, magnetic field can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential which satisfies\nLaplace's equation. It is also pretty clear that, if we can assign the scalar potential to have a value\n\nof zero anywhere on the surface of the magnetic circuit it will be zero over all of the magnetic\ncircuit (i.e. at both the top of the gap and the bottom of the magnet). Finally, note that we can't\nactually assume that the scalar potential satisfies Laplace's equation everywhere in the problem.\nIn fact the divergence of M is zero everywhere except at the top surface of the magnet where it is\nsingular! In fact, we can note that there is a (some would say fictitious) magnetic charge density:\nρm = -r · M~\nAt the top of the magnet there is a discontinuous change in M and so the equivalent of a\nmagnetic surface charge. Using Hg to note the magnetic field above the magnet and Hm to note\nthe magnetic field in the magnet,\nμ0Hg\n=\nμ0 (Hm + M0)\nσm\n=\nM0 = Hg -Hm\nand then to satisfy the potential condition, if hm is the height of the magnet and g is the gap:\ngHg = hmHm\nSolving,\nhm\nHg = M0 hm + g\nNow, one more observation could be made. We would produce the same air-gap flux density\nif we regard the permanent magnet as having a surface current around the periphery equal to the\nmagnetization intensity. That is, if the surface current runs around the magnet:\nKφ = M0\nThis would produce an MMF in the gap of:\nF = Kφhm\nand then since the magnetic field is just the MMF divided by the total gap:\nF\nhm\nHg =\n= M0\nhm + g\nhm + g\nThe real utility of permanent magnets comes about from the relatively large magnetizations:\nnumbers of a few to several thousand amperes per meter are common, and these would translate\ninto enormous current densities in magnets of ordinary size.\nSimple Permanent Magnet Machine Structures: Commutator\nMachines\nFigure 17 is a cartoon picture of a cross section of the geometry of a two-pole commutator machine\nusing permanent magnets. This is actually the most common geometry that is used. The rotor\n(armature) of the machine is a conventional, windings-in-slots type, just as we have already seen\n\nField Magnets\nΩ\nStator Yoke\nArmature Winding\nRotor\nFigure 17: PM Commutator Machine\nfor commutator machines. The field magnets are fastened (often just bonded) to the inside of a\nsteel tube that serves as the magnetic flux return path.\nAssume for the purpose of first-order analysis of this thing that the magnet is describable by its\nremanent flux density Br and had permeability of μ0. First, we will estimate the useful magnetic\nflux density and then will deal with voltage generated in the armature. Interaction Flux Density\nUsing the basics of the analysis presented above, we may estimate the radial magnetic flux density\nat the air-gap as being:\nBr\nBd = 1 +\nPc\nwhere the effective unit permeance is:\nfl hm Ag\nPc = ff g Am\nA book on this topic by James Ireland suggests values for the two \"fudge factors\":\n1. The \"leakage factor\" fl is cited as being about 1.1.\n2. The \"reluctance factor\" ff is cites as being about 1.2.\nWe may further estimate the ratio of areas of the gap and magnet by:\nAg\nR + g\n=\nAm\nR + g + h\nm\nNow, there are a bunch of approximations and hand wavings in this expression, but it seems to\nwork, at least for the kind of machines contemplated.\nA second correction is required to correct the effective length for electrical interaction. The\nreason for this is that the magnets produce fringing fields, as if they were longer than the actual\n\n\"stack length\" of the rotor (sometimes they actually are). This is purely empirical, and Ireland\ngives a value for effective length for voltage generation of:\n`∗\n`eff = f`\nwhere `∗ = ` + 2NR , and the empirical coefficient\nA\nhm\nN ≈\nlog\n1 + B\nB\nR\nwhere\nhm\nB =\n7.4 -9.0 R\nA =\n0.9\n3.0.1\nVoltage:\nIt is, in this case, simplest to consider voltage generated in a single wire first. If the machine is\nrunning at angular velocity Ω, speed voltage is, while the wire is under a magnet,\nvs = ΩR`Br\nNow, if the magnets have angular extent θm the voltage induced in a wire will have a waveform\nas shown in Figure 18: It is pulse-like and has the same shape as the magnetic field of the magnets.\nθm\nπ\nvs\nΩt\nFigure 18: Voltage Induced in One Conductor\nThe voltage produced by a coil is actually made up of two waveforms of exactly this form, but\nseparated in time by the \"coil throw\" angle. Then the total voltage waveform produced will be\nthe sum of the two waveforms. If the coil thrown angle is larger than the magnet angle, the two\nvoltage waveforms add to look like this: There are actually two coil-side waveforms that add with\na slight phase shift.\nIf, on the other hand, the coil thrown is smaller than the magnet angle, the picture is the same,\nonly the width of the pulses is that of the coil rather than the magnet. In either case the average\nvoltage generated by a coil is:\nθ∗\nv = ΩR`Ns\nBd\nπ\n\nvc\n0m\n0m\nFigure 19: Voltage Induced in a Coil\nwhere θ∗ is the lesser of the coil throw or magnet angles and Ns is the number of series turns in\nthe coil. This gives us the opportunity to develop the number of \"active\" turns:\nCa = Ns\nθ∗\nCtot θ∗\n=\nm\nπ\nm\nπ\nHere, Ca is the number of active conductors, Ctot is the total number of conductors and m is the\nnumber of parallel paths. The motor coefficient is then:\nR`effCtotBd θ∗\nK =\nm\nπ\n3.1\nArmature Resistance\nThe last element we need for first-order prediction of performance of the motor is the value of\narmature resistance. The armature resistance is simply determined by the length and area of the\nwire and by the number of parallel paths (generally equal to 2 for small commutator motors). If\nwe note Nc as the number of coils and Na as the number of turns per coil,\nNcNa\nNs =\nm\nTotal armature resistance is given by:\nNs\nRa = 2ρw`t m\nwhere ρw is the resistivity (per unit length) of the wire:\nρw = πd2 σw\n4 w\n(dw is wire diameter, σw is wire conductivity and `t is length of one half-turn). This length depends\non how the machine is wound, but a good first-order guess might be something like this:\n`t ≈ ` + πR\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.061 / 6.690 Introduction to Electric Power Systems\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Kirtley Jr.\nIntroduction\nThis document is a brief introduction to the design evaluation of permanent magnet motors, with\nan eye toward servo and drive applications. It is organized in the following manner: First, we\ndescribe three different geometrical arrangements for permanent magnet motors:\n1. Surface Mounted Magnets, Conventional Stator,\n2. Surface Mounted Magnets, Air-Gap Stator Winding, and\n3. Internal Magnets (Flux Concentrating).\nAfter a qualitative discussion of these geometries, we will discuss the elementary rating param\neters of the machine and show how to arrive at a rating and how to estimate the torque and power\nvs. speed capability of the motor. Then we will discuss how the machine geometry can be used to\nestimate both the elementary rating parameters and the parameters used to make more detailed\nestimates of the machine performance.\nSome of the more involved mathematical derivations are contained in appendices to this note.\nMotor Morphologies\nThere are, of course, many ways of building permanent magnet motors, but we will consider only a\nfew in this note. Actually, once these are understood, rating evaluations of most other geometrical\narrangements should be fairly straightforward. It should be understood that the \"rotor inside\" vs.\n\"rotor outside\" distinction is in fact trivial, with very few exceptions, which we will note.\n∗ c2003 James L. Kirtley Jr.\n\n2.1\nSurface Magnet Machines\nFigure 1 shows the basic magnetic morphology of the motor with magnets mounted on the surface\nof the rotor and an otherwise conventional stator winding. This sketch does not show some of\nthe important mechanical aspects of the machine, such as the means for fastening the permanent\nmagnets to the rotor, so one should look at it with a bit of caution. In addition, this sketch and\nthe other sketches to follow are not necessarily to a scale that would result in workable machines.\nStator Core\nRotor Core\nStator Windings\nin Slots\nRotor\nMagnets\nFigure 1: Axial View of a Surface Mount Motor\nThis figure shows an axial section of a four-pole (p = 2) machine.\nThe four magnets are\nmounted on a cylindrical rotor \"core\", or shaft, made of ferromagnetic material. Typically this\nwould simply be a steel shaft. In some applications the magnets may be simply bonded to the\nsteel. For applications in which a glue joint is not satisfactory (e.g. for high speed machines) some\nsort of rotor banding or retaining ring structure is required.\nThe stator winding of this machine is \"conventional\", very much like that of an induction motor,\nconsisting of wires located in slots in the surface of the stator core. The stator core itself is made of\nlaminated ferromagnetic material (probably silicon iron sheets), the character and thickness of the\nsheets determined by operating frequency and efficiency requirements. They are required to carry\nalternating magnetic fields, so must be laminated to reduce eddy current losses.\nThis sort of machine is simple in construction. Note that the operating magnetic flux density in\nthe air-gap is nearly the same as in the magnets, so that this sort of machine cannot have air-gap\nflux densities higher than that of the remanent flux density of the magnets. If low cost ferrite\nmagnets are used, this means relatively low induction and consequently relatively low efficiency\nand power density. (Note the qualifier \"relatively\" here!). Note, however, that with modern, high\nperformance permanent magnet materials in which remanent flux densities can be on the order of\n1.2 T, air-gap working flux densities can be on the order of 1 T. With the requirement for slots to\ncarry the armature current, this may be a practical limit for air-gap flux density anyway.\nIt is also important to note that the magnets in this design are really in the \"air gap\" of\n\nthe machine, and therefore are exposed to all of the time- and space- harmonics of the stator\nwinding MMF. Because some permanent magnets have electrical conductivity (particularly the\nhigher performance magnets), any asynchronous fields will tend to produce eddy currents and\nconsequent losses in the magnets.\n2.2\nInterior Magnet or Flux Concentrating Machines\nInterior magnet designs have been developed to counter several apparent or real shortcomings of\nsurface mount motors:\n- Flux concentrating designs allow the flux density in the air-gap to be higher than the flux\ndensity in the magnets themselves.\n- In interior magnet designs there is some degree of shielding of the magnets from high order\nspace harmonic fields by the pole pieces.\n- There are control advantages to some types of interior magnet motors, as we will show anon.\nEssentially, they have relatively large negative saliency which enhances \"flux weakening\" for\nhigh speed operation, in rather direct analogy the what is done in DC machines.\n- Some types of internal magnet designs have (or claim) structural advantages over surface\nmount magnet designs.\nStator Core\nArmature Winding\nin Slots\nNon-Magnetic\nRotor Core\nRotor\nMagnets\nRotor Pole\nPieces\nFigure 2: Axial View of a Flux Concentrating Motor\nThe geometry of one type of internal magnet motor is shown (crudely) in Figure 2.\nThe\npermanent magnets are oriented so that their magnetization is azimuthal. They are located between\nwedges of magnetic material (the pole pieces) in the rotor. Flux passes through these wedges,\ngoing radially at the air- gap, then azimuthally through the magnets. The central core of the rotor\n\nmust be non-magnetic, to prevent \"shorting out\" the magnets. No structure is shown at all in\nthis drawing, but quite obviously this sort of rotor is a structural challenge. Shown is a six-pole\nmachine. Typically, one does not expect flux concentrating machines to have small pole numbers,\nbecause it is difficult to get more area inside the rotor than around the periphery. On the other\nhand, a machine built in this way but without substantial flux concentration will still have saliency\nand magnet shielding properties.\nStator Core\nStator Slots\nAir Gap\nRotor\nSaliency Slots\nFigure 3: Axial View of Internal Magnet Motor\nA second morphology for an internal magneti motor is shown in Figure 3.\nThis geometry\nhas been proposed for highly salient synchronous machines without permanent magnets: such\nmachines would run on the saliency torque and are called synchronous reluctance motors. however,\nthe saliency slots may be filled with permanent magnet material, giving them some internally\ngenerated flux as well. The rotor iron tends to short out the magnets, so that the 'bridges' around\nthe ends of the permanent magnets must be relatively thin. They are normally saturated.\nAt first sight, these machines appear to be quite complicated to analyze, and that judgement\nseems to hold up.\n2.3\nAir Gap Armature Windings\nShown in Figure 4 is a surface-mounted magnet machine with an air-gap, or surface armature\nwinding. Such machines take advantage of the fact that modern permanent magnet materials have\nvery low permeabilities and that, therefore, the magnetic field produced is relatively insensitive to\nthe size of the air-gap of the machine. It is possible to eliminate the stator teeth and use all of the\nperiphery of the air-gap for windings.\nNot shown in this figure is the structure of the armature winding.\nThis is not an issue in\n\"conventional\" stators, since the armature is contained in slots in the iron stator core. The use of\nan air-gap winding gives opportunities for economy of construction, new armature winding forms\nsuch as helical windings, elimination of \"cogging\" torques, and (possibly) higher power densities.\n\nStator Back I\nr\no\no\nFigure 4: Axial View of a PM Motor With an Air-Gap Winding\n3 Zeroth Order Rating\nIn determining the rating of a machine, we may consider two separate sets of parameters. The first\nset, the elementary rating parameters, consist of the machine inductances, internal flux linkage and\nstator resistance. From these and a few assumptions about base and maximum speed it is possible\nto get a first estimate of the rating and performance of the motor. More detailed performance\nestimates, including efficiency in sustained operation, require estimation of other parameters. We\nwill pay more attention to that first set of parameters, but will attempt to show how at least some\nof the more complete operating parameters can be estimated.\n3.1 Voltage and Current: Round Rotor\nTo get started, consider the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 5. This is actually the equivalent\ncircuit which describes all round rotor synchronous machines. It is directly equivalent only to some\nof the machines we are dealing with here, but it will serve to illustrate one or two important points.\nWhat is shown here is the equivalent circuit of a single phase of the machine. Most motors\nare three-phase, but it is not difficult to carry out most of the analysis for an arbitrary number\nof phases. The circuit shows an internal voltage Ea and a reactance X which together with the\nterminal current I determine the terminal voltage V. In this picture armature resistance is ignored.\nIf the machine is running in the sinusoidal steady state, the major quantities are of the form:\nEa = wAa cos (wt +6)\n& = Vcoswt\nI, = Icos (wt - +)\nThe machine is in synchronous operation if the internal and external voltages are at the same\n\n-\n\n+\n\n?\n-\nHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH H\nj\nB\nB\n\nB\nB\nB M\nX\nIa\n∩∩∩∩\n+ Ea\nVt\n-\nFigure 5: Synchronous Machine Equivalent Circuit\nI\n\n�\n�\n\nψ\nV\nδ\nB\nB\njXI\nEa\nB\nFigure 6: Phasor Diagram For A Synchronous Machine\nfrequency and have a constant (or slowly changing) phase relationship (δ). The relationship between\nthe major variables may be visualized by the phasor diagram shown in Figure 3.1. The internal\nvoltage is just the time derivative of the internal flux from the permanent magnets, and the voltage\ndrop in the machine reactance is also the time derivative of flux produced by armature current in\nthe air-gap and in the \"leakage\" inductances of the machine. By convention, the angle ψ is positive\nwhen current I lags voltage V and the angle δ is positive then internal voltage Ea leads terminal\nvoltage V . So both of these angles have negative sign in the situation shown in Figure 3.1.\nIf there are q phases, the time average power produced by this machine is simply:\nq\nP =\nV I cos ψ\nFor most polyphase machines operating in what is called \"balanced\" operation (all phases doing\nthe same thing with uniform phase differences between phases), torque (and consequently power)\nare approximately constant. Since we have ignored power dissipated in the machine armature, it\nmust be true that power absorbed by the internal voltage source is the same as terminal power, or:\nq\nP =\nEaI cos (ψ -δ)\n\nSince in the steady state:\nω\nP =\nT\np\nwhere T is torque and ω/p is mechanical rotational speed, torque can be derived from the terminal\nquantities by simply:\nq\nT = p λaI cos (ψ -δ)\nIn principal, then, to determine the torque and hence power rating of a machine it is only\nnecessary to determine the internal flux, the terminal current capability, and the speed capability\nof the rotor. In fact it is almost that simple. Unfortunately, the model shown in Figure 5 is not\nquite complete for some of the motors we will be dealing with, and we must go one more level into\nmachine theory.\n3.2\nA Little Two-Reaction Theory\nThe material in this subsection is framed in terms of three-phase (q = 3) machine theory, but\nit is actually generalizable to an arbitrary number of phases. Suppose we have a machine whose\nthree-phase armature can be characterized by internal fluxes and inductance which may, in general,\nnot be constant but is a function of rotor position. Note that the simple model we presented in\nthe previous subsection does not conform to this picture, because it assumes a constant terminal\ninductance. In that case, we have:\nλph = L Iph + λR\n(1)\nph\nwhere λR is the set of internally produced fluxes (from the permanent magnets) and the stator\nwinding may have both self- and mutual- inductances.\nNow, we find it useful to do a transformation on these stator fluxes in the following way: each\narmature quantity, including flux, current and voltage, is projected into a coordinate system that\nis fixed to the rotor. This is often called the Park's Transformation. For a three phase machine it\nis:\n\n⎡\nud\n⎤\n⎡\nua\n\n⎢ u\n⎣\nq\n= udq = Tuph = T ub\n⎤\n\n(2)\nu0\n⎥\n⎢\nuc\n⎥\nWhere the transformation and its inve\n⎦\nrse are:\n⎣\n⎦\n\n⎡\nos\ncos(θ\n2π\nc\nθ\n-\n)\ncos(θ + 2π)\nT\n⎢\n\n=\n-sin θ\n-sin(θ - 2π)\n-sin(θ + 2π)\n\n(3)\n3 ⎣\n⎤\n⎥\n\n⎦\n⎡\ncos θ\n-sin θ\n-1\n\n(\nπ\nT\n= ⎢ cos θ - 2 )\n-sin(θ - 2π)\n\n⎤\n(4)\n⎣\n\ncos(θ + 2π)\n-sin(θ + 2π)\n⎥⎦\n\nIt is easy to show that balanced polyphase quantities in the stationary, or phase variable frame,\ntranslate into constant quantities in the so-called \"d-q\" frame. For example:\nIa =\nI cos ωt\n2π\nIb =\nI cos(ωt -\n)\n2π\nIc =\nI cos(ωt +\n)\nθ =\nωt + θ0\nmaps to:\nId =\nI cos θ0\nIq\n=\n-I sin θ0\nNow, if θ = ωt + θ0, the transformation coordinate system is chosen correctly and the \"d-\" axis\nwill correspond with the axis on which the rotor magnets are making positive flux. That happens\nif, when θ = 0, phase A is linking maximum positive flux from the permanent magnets. If this is\nthe case, the internal fluxes are:\nλaa =\nλf cos θ\n2π\nλab =\nλf cos(θ -\n)\n2π\nλac =\nλf cos(θ +\n)\nNow, if we compute the fluxes in the d-q frame, we have:\nλdq = L\nI\n+ λ\n= TL T -1I\n+ λ\n(5)\ndq dq\nR\ndq\nR\nph\n\nNow: two things should be noted here. The first is that, if the coordinate system has been chosen\nas described above, the flux induced by the rotor is, in the d-q frame, simply:\n\n⎡\nλf\nλR =\n⎤\n⎢⎣ 0\n⎥\n(6)\n⎦\nThat is, the magnets produce flux only on the d- axis.\nThe second thing to note is that, under certain assumptions, the inductances in the d-q frame\nare independent of rotor position and have no mutual terms. That is:\n\nL\n\nd 0\n\nL\n= T L T -1 =\nLq\n\n(7)\ndq\nph\n⎡\n⎤\n⎣⎢\nL0\n⎥⎦\nThe assertion that inductances in the d-q frame are constant is actually questionable, but it is\nclose enough to being true and analyses that use it have proven to be close enough to being correct\nthat it (the assertion) has held up to the test of time. In fact the deviations from independence\n\non rotor position are small. Independence of axes (that is, absence of mutual inductances in the\nd-q frame) is correct because the two axes are physically orthogonal. We tend to ignore the third,\nor \"zero\" axis in this analysis. It doesn't couple to anything else and has neither flux nor current\nanyway. Note that the direct- and quadrature- axis inductances are in principle straightforward to\ncompute. They are\ndirect axis the inductance of one of the armature phases (corrected for the fact of multiple phases)\nwith the rotor aligned with the axis of the phase, and\nquadrature axis the inductance of one of the phases with the rotor aligned 90 electrical degrees\naway from the axis of that phase.\nNext, armature voltage is, ignoring resistance, given by:\nd\nd\n=\n=\nT -1λdq\n(8)\nV ph\ndt λph\ndt\nand that the transformed armature voltage must be:\n=\nV dq\nTV ph\nd\n=\nT\n(T -1λdq)\ndt\nd\nd\nλdq + (T\nT -1)λdq\n(9)\n=\ndt\ndt\nThe second term in this expresses \"speed voltage\". A good deal of straightforward but tedious\nmanipulation yields:\n⎡\n⎤\n-dθ\nd\ndt\nT\nT -1\n⎢ dθ\n0 ⎥\n(10)\n= ⎣ dt\n⎦\ndt\nThe direct- and quadrature- axis voltage expressions are then:\ndλd\nVd =\n-ωλq\n(11)\ndt\ndλq\nVq\n=\n+ ωλd\n(12)\ndt\nwhere\ndθ\nω = dt\nInstantaneous power is given by:\nP = VaIa + VbIb + VcIc\n(13)\nUsing the transformations given above, this can be shown to be:\nP =\nVqIq + 3V0I0\n(14)\nVdId +\n\nwhich, in turn, is:\n3 dλd\ndλq\ndλ0\nP = ω (λdIq -λqId) +\n(\nIq) + 3\nI0\n(15)\nId +\ndt\ndt\ndt\nThen, noting that ω = pΩ and that (15) describes electrical terminal power as the sum of shaft\npower and rate of change of stored energy, we may deduce that torque is given by:\nq\nT =\np(λdIq -λqId)\n(16)\nNote that we have stated a generalization to a q- phase machine even though the derivation\ngiven here was carried out for the q = 3 case. Of course three phase machines are by far the\nmost common case. Machines with higher numbers of phases behave in the same way (and this\ngeneralization is valid for all purposes to which we put it), but there are more rotor variables\nanalogous to \"zero axis\".\nNow, noting that, in general, Ld and Lq are not necessarily equal,\nλd =\nLdId + λf\n(17)\nλq\n=\nLqIq\n(18)\nthen torque is given by:\nq\nT = p (λf + (Ld -Lq) Id) Iq\n(19)\n3.3\nFinding Torque Capability\nFor high performance drives, we will generally assume that the power supply, generally an inverter,\ncan supply currents in the correct spatial relationship to the rotor to produce torque in some\nreasonably effective fashion. We will show in this section how to determine, given a required torque\n(or if the torque is limited by either voltage or current which we will discuss anon), what the\nvalues of Id and Iq must be. Then the power supply, given some means of determining where the\nrotor is (the instantaneous value of θ), will use the inverse Park's transformation to determine the\ninstantaneous valued required for phase currents. This is the essence of what is known as \"field\noriented control\", or putting stator currents in the correct location in space to produce the required\ntorque.\nOur objective in this section is, given the elementary parameters of the motor, find the capability\nof the motor to produce torque. There are three things to consider here:\n- Armature current is limited, generally by heating,\n- A second limit is the voltage capability of the supply, particularly at high speed, and\n- If the machine is operating within these two limits, we should consider the optimal placement\nof currents (that is, how to get the most torque per unit of current to minimize losses).\nOften the discussion of current placement is carried out using, as a tool to visualize what is going\non, the Id, Iq plane. Operation in the steady state implies a single point on this plane. A simple\nillustration is shown in Figure 7. The thermally limited armature current capability is represented\nas a circle around the origin, since the magnitude of armature current is just the length of a vector\nfrom the origin in this space. Note that since in general, for permanent magnet machines with\n\nid\niq\nCurrent Limit Locus\nVoltage Limit\nLocus\nOptimal Torque\nLocus\nShort Circuit\nPoint\nFigure 7: Limits to Operation\nburied magnets, Ld < Lq, so the optimal operation of the machine will be with negative Id. We\nwill show how to determine this optimum operation anon, but it will in general follow a curve in\nthe Id, Iq plane as shown.\nFinally, an ellipse describes the voltage limit. To start, consider what would happen if the\nterminals of the machine were to be short-circuited so that V = 0. If the machine is operating at\nsufficiently high speed so that armature resistance is negligible, armature current would be simply:\nλf\nId =\n- Ld\nIq\n=\nNow, loci of constant flux turn out to be ellipses around this point on the plane. Since terminal\nflux is proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to frequency, if the machine is operating\nwith a given terminal voltage, the ability of that voltage to command current in the Id, Iq plane is\nan ellipse whose size \"shrinks\" as speed increases.\nTo simplify the mathematics involved in this estimation, we normalize reactances, fluxes, cur\nrents and torques. First, let us define the base flux to be simply λb = λf and the base current Ib to\nbe the armature capability. Then we define two per-unit reactances:\nLdIb\nxd =\nλb\n(20)\nxq\n=\nLqIb\nλb\n(21)\nNext, define the base torque to be:\nTb = p q λbIb\nand then, given per-unit currents id and iq, the per-unit torque is simply:\nte = (1 -(xq -xd) id) iq\n(22)\n\nv\n\nu\n\nu\n\nui2a\ni2\n\nid =\n- t\n+ 2\n\nxq -xd)\n!\na\n-\n+\n(23)\n4 (\n2 (xq -xd)\nu\nv\nu\n4 (xq -xd)\n!\n\nv\nt\n\nu\n\nu\n\n!2\nu\nv\n\n!2\ni2\ni2\n\niq =\na\n\na\n-\n-2\n+\n+\n(24)\n4 (xq -xd)\n2 (xq -xd)\n4 (xq -xd)\nt\nu\nv\nq\nIt is fairly straightforward (but a bit tedious) to show that the locus of current-optimal operation\n(that is, the largest torque for a given current magnitude or the smallest current magnitude for a\ngiven torque) is along the curve:\nu\nt\nThe \"rating point\" will be the point along this curve when ia = 1, or where this curve crosses the\narmature capability circle in the id, iq plane. It should be noted that this set of expressions only\nworks for salient machines. For non-salient machines, of course, torque-optimal current is on the\nq-axis. In general, for machines with saliency, the \"per-unit\" torque will not be unity at the rating,\nso that the rated, or \"Base Speed\" torque is not the \"Base\" torque, but:\nTr = Tb × te\n(25)\nwhere te is calculated at the rating point (that is, ia = 1 and id and iq as per (23) and (24)).\nFor sufficiently low speeds, the power electronic drive can command the optimal current to\nproduce torque up to rated. However, for speeds higher than the \"Base Speed\", this is no longer\ntrue. Define a per-unit terminal flux:\nV\nψ = ωλb\nOperation at a given flux magnitude implies:\nψ2 = (1 + xdid)2 + (xqiq)2\nwhich is an ellipse in the id, iq plane. The Base Speed is that speed at which this ellipse crosses the\npoint where the optimal current curve crosses the armature capability. Operation at the highest\nattainable torque (for a given speed) generally implies d-axis currents that are higher than those\non the optimal current locus. What is happening here is the (negative) d-axis current serves to\nreduce effective machine flux and hence voltage which is limiting q-axis current. Thus operation\nabove the base speed is often referred to as \"flux weakening\".\nThe strategy for picking the correct trajectory for current in the id, iq plane depends on the\nvalue of the per-unit reactance xd. For values of xd > 1, it is possible to produce some torque at any\nspeed. For values of xd < 1, there is a speed for which no point in the armature current capability is\nwithin the voltage limiting ellipse, so that useful torque has gone to zero. Generally, the maximum\ntorque operating point is the intersection of the armature current limit and the voltage limiting\nellipse:\nu\n!2\nu\nxd\nt\nxd\nxq -ψ2 + 1\nid =\nx2 q -x2\nd\n-\nx2 q -x2\nd\n+\nx2 q -x2\nd\n(26)\niq\n=\n1 -id\n(27)\n\nv\nq\nTable 1: Example Machine\nD- Axis Inductance\n2.53 mHy\nQ- Axis Inductance\n6.38 mHy\nInternal Flux\n58.1 mWb\nArmature Current\n30 A\nTable 2: Operating Characteristics of Example Machine\nPer-Unit D-Axis Current At Rating Point\nid\n-.5924\nPer-Unit Q-Axis Current At Rating Point\niq\n.8056\nPer-Unit D-Axis Reactance\nxd\n1.306\nPer-Unit Q-Axis Reactance\nxq\n3.294\nRated Torque (Nm)\nTr\n9.17\nTerminal Voltage at Base Point (V)\nIt may be that there is no intersection between the armature capability and the voltage limiting\nellipse. If this is the case and if xd < 1, torque capability at the given speed is zero.\nIf, on the other hand, xd > 1, it may be that the intersection between the voltage limiting\nellipse and the armature current limit is not the maximum torque point. To find out, we calculate\nthe maximum torque point on the voltage limiting ellipse.\nThis is done in the usual way by\ndifferentiating torque with respect to id while holding the relationship between id and iq to be on\nthe ellipse. The algebra is a bit messy, and results in:\nu\n!2\n3xd (xq -xd) -x2\nu 3xd (xq -xd) -x2\n(xq -xd) (ψ2 -1) + xd\nid =\n-\n4xd\n2 (xq -xd)\nd -t\n4xd\n2 (xq -xd)\nd\n+\n2 (xq -xd) xd\n(28)\niq\n=\nψ2 -(1 + xdid)2\n(29)\nxq\nOrdinarily, it is probably easiest to compute (28) and (29) first, then test to see if the currents\nare outside the armature capability, and if they are, use (26) and (27).\nThese expressions give us the capability to estimate the torque-speed curve for a machine. As\nan example, the machine described by the parameters cited in Table 1 is a (nominal) 3 HP, 4-pole,\n3000 RPM machine.\nThe rated operating point turns out to have the following attributes:\nThe loci of operation in the Id, Iq plane is shown in Figure 8. The armature current limit\nis shown only in the second and third quadrants, so shows up as a semicircle. The two ellipses\ncorrespond with the rated point (the larger ellipse) and with a speed that is three times rated\n(9000 RPM). The torque-optimal current locus can be seen running from the origin to the rating\npoint, and the higher speed operating locus follows the armature current limit. Figure 9 shows the\ntorque/speed and power/speed curves. Note that this sort of machine only approximates \"constant\npower\" operation at speeds above the \"base\" or rating point speed.\n\nPM Brushless Machine Current Loci\n-60\n-40\n-20\nQ-Axis Current (A)\n-80\n-60\n-40\n-20\nD-Axis Current (A)\nFigure 8: Operating Current Loci of Example Machine\nPM Brushless Machine\nTorque, N-m\n0 0\nPower, Watts\nSpeed, RPM\nFigure 9: Torque- and Power-Speed Capability\n\nParameter Estimation\nWe are now at the point of estimating the major parameters of the motors. Because we have a\nnumber of different motor geometries to consider, but because they share parameters in not too\norderly a fashion, this section will have a number of sub-parts. First, we calculate flux linkage,\nthen reactance.\n4.1\nFlux Linkage\nGiven a machine which may be considered to be uniform in the axial direction, flux linked by a\nsingle, full-pitched coil which spans an angle from zero to π/p, is:\nZ π\np\nφ =\nBrRldφ\nwhere Br is the radial flux through the coil. And, if Br is sinusoidally distributed this will have\na peak value of\n2RlBr\nφp =\np\nNow, if the actual winding has Na turns, and using the pitch and breadth factors derived in\nAppendix 1, the total flux linked is simply:\n2RlB1Nakw\nλf =\n(30)\np\nwhere\nkw =\nkpkb\nα\nkp =\nsin 2\nsin m γ\nkb =\nm sin γ\nThe angle α is the pitch angle,\nNp\nα = 2πp Ns\nwhere Np is the coil span (in slots) and Ns is the total number of slots in the stator. The angle γ\nis the slot electrical angle:\n2πp\nγ = Ns\nNow, what remains to be found is the space fundamental magnetic flux density B1. In the\nthird appendix it is shown that, for magnets in a surface-mount geometry, the magnetic field at\nthe surface of the magnetic gap is:\nB1 = μ0M1kg\n(31)\nwhere the space-fundamental magnetization is:\n\nBr 4\npθm\nM1 =\nsin\nμ0 π\nwhere Br is remanent flux density of the permanent magnets and θm is the magnet angle.\nand where the factor that describes the geometry of the magnetic gap depends on the case. For\nmagnets inside and p 6\n1,\n=\nRs\np-1\np\n\nRp+1 -Rp+1\np\n2p 1-p\n1-p\nkg =\n2p\n2p\n+\nRi\nR1\n-R2\nRs -R\np + 1\np -1\ni\nFor magnets inside and p = 1,\nkg =\nR2\n2 -R2\n1 + Ri\n2 log R2\nR2 s -Ri\nR1\nFor the case of magnets outside and p 6\n1:\n=\nRi\np-1\np\nRp+1 -Rp+1\np\nR2p\n1-p\n1-p\nkg =\nRs\n2p -Ri\n2p\np + 1\n+ p -1\ns\nR1\n-R2\nand for magnets outside and p = 1,\nkg\nR2\n2 -R1\n2 + Rs\n2 log R2\n= R2 s -Ri\nR1\nWhere Rs and Ri are the outer and inner magnetic boundaries, respectively, and R2 and R1\nare the outer and inner boundaries of the magnets.\nNote that for the case of a small gap, in which both the physical gap g and the magnet thickness\nhm are both much less than rotor radius, it is straightforward to show that all of the above expres\nsions approach what one would calculate using a simple, one-dimensional model for the permanent\nmagnet:\nhm\nkg → g + hm\nThis is the whole story for the winding-in-slot, narrow air-gap, surface magnet machine. For air\ngap armature windings, it is necessary to take into account the radial dependence of the magnetic\nfield.\n4.2\nAir-Gap Armature Windings\nWith no windings in slots, the conventional definition of winding factor becomes difficult to apply.\nIf, however, each of the phase belts of the winding occupies an angular extent θw, then the equivalent\nto (31) is:\nkw = sin\nθ\np\nw\nθ\nw\np 2\n\nZ\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\nNext, assume that the \"density\" of conductors within each of the phase belts of the armature\nwinding is uniform, so that the density of turns as a function of radius is:\n2Nar\nN(r) = R2 -R2\nwo\nwi\nThis just expresses the fact that there is more azimuthal room at larger radii, so with uniform\ndensity the number of turns as a function of radius is linearly dependent on radius. Here, Rwo and\nRwi are the outer and inner radii, respectively, of the winding.\nNow it is possible to compute the flux linked due to a magnetic field distribution:\nRwo 2lNakwr\n2r\nλf =\nμ0Hr(r)dr\n(32)\np\nR2 -R2\nRwi\nwo\nwi\nNote the form of the magnetic field as a function of radius expressed in 80 and 81 of the second\nappendix. For the \"winding outside\" case it is:\nHr = A rp-1 + Rs\n2pr -p-1\nThen a winding with all its turns concentrated at the outer radius r = Rwo would link flux:\n2lRwokw\n2lRwokw\nRp-1\nR-p-1\nλc =\nμ0Hr(Rwo) =\nμ0A\nwo + R2\ns\np\nwo\np\np\nCarrying out (32), it is possible, then, to express the flux linked by a thick winding to the flux that\nwould have been linked by a radially concentrated winding at its outer surface by:\nλf\nkt = λc\nwhere, for the winding outside, p 6\n2 case:\n=\n1 -x2+p ξ2p\n1 -x2-p\nkt =\n+\n(33)\n(1 -x2) (1 + ξ2p)\n2 + p\n2 -p\nwhere we have used the definitions ξ = Rwo/Rs and x = Rwi/Rwo. In the case of winding outside,\np = 2,\n1 -x4 ξ4\nkt =\n-log x\n(34)\n(1 -x2) (1 + ξ2p)\nIn a very similar way, we can define a winding factor for a thick winding in which the reference\nradius is at the inner surface. (Note: this is done because the inner surface of the inside winding\nis likely to be coincident with the inner ferromagnetic surface, as the outer surface of the outer\nwinding ls likely to be coincident with the outer ferromagnetic surface). For p 6\n2:\n=\n2x-p\n1 -x2+p\n1 -x2-p\nkt =\n+ (ηx)2p\n(35)\n(1 -x2) (1 + η2p)\n2 + p\n2 -p\nand for p = 2:\n2x-2\n1 -x4\nkt =\n-(ηx)4 log x\n(36)\n(1 -x2) (1 + η2p)\n\nwhere η = Ri/Rwi\nSo, in summary, the flux linked by an air-gap armature is given by:\n2RlB1Nakwkt\nλf =\n(37)\np\nwhere B1 is the flux density at the outer radius of the physical winding (for outside winding\nmachines) or at the inner radius of the physical winding (for inside winding machines). Note that\nthe additional factor kt is a bit more than one (it approaches unity for thin windings), so that,\nfor small pole numbers and windings that are not too thick, it is almost correct and in any case\n\"conservative\" to take it to be one.\n4.3\nInterior Magnet Motors:\nFor the flux concentrating machine, it is possible to estimate air-gap flux density using a simple\nreluctance model.\nThe air- gap permeance of one pole piece is:\nRθp\n℘ag = μ0l g\nwhere θp is the angular width of the pole piece.\nAnd the incremental permeance of a magnet is:\nhml\n℘m = μ0 wm\nThe magnet sees a unit permeance consisting of its own permeance in series with one half of\neach of two pole pieces (in series) :\n℘ag\nRθp wm\n℘u =\n=\n℘m\n4g hm\nMagnetic flux density in the magnet is:\n℘u\nBm = B0 1 + ℘u\nAnd then flux density in the air gap is:\n2hm\n2hmwm\nBg =\nBm = B0\nRθp\n4ghm + Rθpwm\nThe space fundamental of that can be written as:\npθp\nwm\nB1 =\nsin\nB0\nγm\nπ\n2g\nwhere we have introduced the shorthand:\nγm =\n1 + wm θp R\ng\n4 hm\nThe flux linkage is then computed as before:\n2RlB1Nakw\nλf =\n(38)\np\n\n4.4\nWinding Inductances\nThe next important set of parameters to compute are the d- and q- axis inductances of the machine.\nWe will consider three separate cases, the winding-in-slot, surface magnet case, which is magnet\nically \"round\", or non-salient, the air-gap winding case, and the flux concentrating case which is\nsalient, or has different direct- and quadrature- axis inductances.\n4.4.1\nSurface Magnets, Windings in Slots\nIn this configuration there is no saliency, so that Ld = Lq.\nThere are two principal parts to\ninductance, the air-gap inductance and slot leakage inductance. Other components, including end\nturn leakage, may be important in some configurations, and they would be computed in the same\nway as for an induction machine. As is shown in the first Appendix, the fundamental part of air-gap\ninductance is:\nq 4 μ0N 2k2 lRs\nLd1 = 2 π p2(g\na\n+\nw\nhw)\n(39)\nHere, g is the magnetic gap, including the physical rotational gap and any magnet retaining means\nthat might be used. hm is the magnet thickness.\nSince the magnet thickness is included in the air-gap, the air-gap permeance may not be very\nlarge, so that slot leakage inductance may be important. To estimate this, assume that the slot\nshape is rectangular, characterized by the following dimensions:\nhs\nheight of the main portion of the slot\nws\nwidth of the top of the main portion of the slot\nhd\nheight of the slot depression\nwd\nslot depression opening\nOf course not all slots are rectangular: in fact in most machines the slots are trapezoidal in\nshape to maintain teeth cross-sections that are radially uniform. However, only a very small error\n(a few percent) is incurred in calculating slot permeance if the slot is assumed to be rectangular\nand the top width is used (that is the width closest to the air-gap). Then the slot permeance is,\nper unit length:\n1 hs\nhd\n+\nP = μ0\n3 ws\nwd\nAssume for the rest of this discussion a standard winding, with m slots in each phase belt\n(this assumes, then, that the total number of slots is Ns = 2pqm), and each slot holds two half-\ncoils.\n(A half-coil is one side of a coil which, of course, is wound in two slots).\nIf each coil\nhas Nc turns (meaning Na = 2pmNc) , then the contribution to phase self-inductance of one\nslot is, if both half-coils are from the same phase, 4lPNc\n2 .\nIf the half-coils are from different\nphases, then the contribution to self inductance is lPNc\n2 and the magnitude of the contribution to\nmutual inductance is lPNc\n2 . (Some caution is required here. For three phase windings the mutual\ninductance is negative, so are the senses of the currents in the two other phases, so the impact of\n\"mutual leakage\" is to increase the reactance. This will be true for other numbers of phases as\nwell, even if the algebraic sign of the mutual leakage inductance is positive, in which case so will\nbe the sense of the other- phase current.)\nWe will make two other assumptions here. The standard one is that the winding \"coil throw\",\nor span between sides of a coil, is N\n2p\ns -Nsp. Nsp is the coil \"short pitch\". The other is that each\nphase belt will overlap with, at most two other phases: the ones on either side in sequence. This\n\nh\ni\nX\n\nlast assumption is immediately true for three- phase windings (because there are only two other\nphases. It is also likely to be true for any reasonable number of phases.\nNoting that each phase occupies 2p(m -Nsp) slots with both coil halves in the same slot and\n4pNsp slots in which one coil half shares a slot with a different phase, we can write down the two\ncomponents of slot leakage inductance, self- and mutual:\nLas =\n2pl (m -Nsp) (2Nc)2 + 2NspNc\nLam =\n2plNspNc\nFor a three- phase machine, then, the total slot leakage inductance is:\nLa = Las + Lam = 2plPNc\n2 (4m -Nsp)\nFor a uniform, symmetric winding with an odd number of phases, it is possible to show that the\neffective slot leakage inductance is:\n2π\nLa = Las -2Lam cos q\nTotal synchronous inductance is the sum of air-gap and leakage components: so far this is:\nLd = Ld1 + La\n4.4.2\nAir-Gap Armature Windings\nIt is shown in Appendix 2 that the inductance of a single-phase of an air-gap winding is:\nLa =\nLnp\nn\nwhere the harmonic components are:\n⎡\n8 μ0lk2 N 2\n1 -x2-kγ2k\n1 -x2+k\nwn\na ⎣\nLk =\nπ k(1 -x2)2\n(4 -k2) (1 -γ2k)\n\nξ2k 1 -xk+2\nξ-2k 1 -x2-k\n+\n+\n(2 + k)2 (1 -γ2k)\n(2 -k)2 (γ-2k -1)\n⎤\n1 -γ-2kx2+k\n1 -x2-k\nk\n1 -x\n+\n-\n⎦\n(4 -k2) (γ-2k -1)\n4 -k2\nwhere we have used the following shorthand coefficients:\nRwi\nx =\nRwo\nRi\nγ =\nRs\nRwo\nξ =\nRs\n\nThis fits into the conventional inductance framework:\n4 μ0N 2\na RsLk\nL =\nwn\nn\nka\nπ\nN2p2g\nif we assign the \"thick armature\" coefficient to be:\n\n-x2\n\n-kγ2k\n\nx\n-\n2+k\ngk\n\nka =\nR\n(1\nx2 2\n)\n⎡\n\n⎣\n(4 -k2) (\n\n1 -γ2k\nwo\n-\n)\n\nξ2k 1 -xk+2\n2k 1 -x2-k\nξ-\n+\n+\n(2 + k) (1 -γ\n\n2k)\n(2 -k\n\n) (γ-2k -\n\n1)\n\n1 -γ-2kx2+k\n1 -x2-k\nk\n1 -x2\n+\n-\n\n(4 -k2) (γ\n\n-\n\n2k -1)\n\n4 -k2\n⎤\n⎦\n\"\n#\n\nand k = np and g = Rs -Ri is the conventionally defined \"air gap\". If the aspect ratio Ri/Rs is\nnot too far from unity, neither is ka. In the case of p = 2, the fundamental component of ka is:\nka = 2gk\n1 -x4\n- 2γ4 + x4 1 -γ4\nlog x +\nγ4\n(log x)2 + ξ4 1 -x42\nRwo (1 -x2)\n4 (1 -γ4)\nξ4 (1 -γ4)\n16 (1 -γ4)\nFor a q-phase winding, a good approximation to the inductance is given by just the first space\nharmonic term, or:\nq 4 μ0N 2RsLk2\nLd =\na\nwn\n2 π\nn2p2g\nka\n4.4.3\nInternal Magnet Motor\nThe permanent magnets will have an effect on reactance because the magnets are in the main flux\npath of the armature. Further, they affect direct and quadrature reactances differently, so that the\nmachine will be salient. Actually, the effect on the direct axis will likely be greater, so that this\ntype of machine will exhibit \"negative\" saliency: the quadrature axis reactance will be larger than\nthe direct- axis reactance.\nA full- pitch coil aligned with the direct axis of the machine would produce flux density:\nμ0NaI\nBr =\n\n2g 1 + Rθp wm\n4g hm\nNote that only the pole area is carrying useful flux, so that the space fundamental of radial flux\ndensity is:\nμ0NaI 4\nsin pθm\nB1 =\n2g\nπ 1 + wm\nRθp\nhm\n4g\nThen, since the flux linked by the winding is:\n2RlNakwB1\nλa =\np\n\nThe d- axis inductance, including mutual phase coupling, is (for a q- phase machine):\nq 4 μ0N 2Rlk2\npθp\nLd = 2 π\np\na\n2g\nw γm sin 2\nThe quadrature axis is quite different. On that axis, the armature does not tend to push flux\nthrough the magnets, so they have only a minor effect. What effect they do have is due to the fact\nthat the magnets produce a space in the active air- gap. Thus, while a full- pitch coil aligned with\nthe quadrature axis will produce an air- gap flux density:\nμ0NI\nBr =\ng\nthe space fundamental of that will be:\nμ0NI 4\npθt\n1 -sin\nB1 =\ng\nπ\nwhere θt is the angular width taken out of the pole by the magnets.\nSo that the expression for quadrature axis inductance is:\nq 4 μ0Na\n2Rlkw\npθt\nLq =\n1 -sin\n2 π\np2g\nCurrent Rating and Resistance\nThe last part of machine rating is its current capability. This is heavily influenced by cooling meth\nods, for the principal limit on current is the heating produced by resistive dissipation. Generally,\nit is possible to do first-order design estimates by assuming a current density that can be handled\nby a particular cooling scheme. Then, in an air-gap winding:\nNaIa =\nR2 -R2\nθwe Ja\nwo\nwi\nand note that, usually, the armature fills the azimuthal space in the machine:\n2qθwe = 2π\nFor a winding in slots, nearly the same thing is true: if the rectangular slot model holds true:\n2qNaIa = NshswsJs\nwhere we are using Js to note slot current density. Now, suppose we can characterize the total slot\narea by a \"space factor\" λs which is the ratio between total slot area and the annulus occupied by\nthe slots: for the rectangular slot model:\nNshsws\nλs =\n\nπ R2 -R2\nwo\nwi\nwhere Rwi = R+hd and Rwo = Rwi +hs in a normal, stator outside winding. In this case, Ja = Jsλs\nand the two types of machines can be evaluated in the same way.\n\nIt would seem apparent that one would want to make λs as large as possible, to permit high\ncurrents. The limit on this is that the magnetic teeth between the conductors must be able to carry\nthe air-gap flux, and making them too narrow would cause them to saturate. The peak of the time\nfundamental magnetic field in the teeth is, for example,\n2πR\nBt = B1 Nswt\nwhere wt is the width of a stator tooth:\n2π(R + hd)\nwt =\nNs\n-ws\nso that\nB1\nBt ≈ 1 -λs\n5.1\nResistance\nWinding resistance may be estimated as the length of the stator conductor divided by its area and\nits conductivity. The length of the stator conductor is:\nlc = 2lNafe\nwhere the \"end winding factor\" fe is used to take into account the extra length of the end turns\n(which is usually not negligible). The area of each turn of wire is, for an air-gap winding :\nR2 -R2\nθwe\nwo\nwi\nAw =\nλw\nNa\nwhere λw, the \"packing factor\" relates the area of conductor to the total area of the winding. The\nresistance is then just:\n4lN 2\nRa =\n\na\n\nR2 -R2\nθwe\nwo\nwi λwσ\nand, of course, σ is the conductivity of the conductor.\nFor windings in slots the expression is almost the same, simply substituting the total slot area:\n2qlNa\nRa = Nshswsλwσ\nThe end turn allowance depends strongly on how the machine is made. One way of estimating\nwhat it might be is to assume that the end turns follow a roughly circular path from one side of\nthe machine to the other. The radius of this circle would be, very roughly, Rw/p, where Rw is the\naverage radius of the winding: Rw ≈ (Rwo + Rwi)/2\nThen the end-turn allowance would be:\nπRw\nfe = 1 +\npl\n\nRi\nRs\nR1\nR2\nr\nθ\nOuter Magnetic\nBoundary\nInner Magnetic\nBoundary\nWinding\nFigure 10: Coordinate System for Inductance Calculation\nAppendix 1: Air-Gap Winding Inductance\nIn this appendix we use a simple two-dimensional model to estimate the magnetic fields and then\ninductances of an air-gap winding. The principal limiting assumption here is that the winding is\nuniform in the ˆz direction, which means it is long in comparison with its radii. This is generally not\ntrue, nevertheless the answers we will get are not too far from being correct. The style of analysis\nused here can be carried into a three-dimensional, or quasi-three dimensional domain to get much\nmore precise answers, at the expense of a very substantial increase in complexity.\nThe coordinate system to be used is shown in Figure 10. To maintain generality we have four\nradii: Ri and Rs are ferromagnetic boundaries, and would of course correspond with the machine\nshaft and the stator core. The winding itself is carried between radii R1 and R2, which correspond\nwith radii Rwi and Rwo in the body of the text. It is assumed that the armature is carrying a\ncurrent in the z- direction, and that this current is uniform in the radial dimension of the armature.\nIf a single phase of the armature is carrying current, that current will be:\nNaIa\nJz0 =\n\nθwe R2\n2 -R2\nover the annular wedge occupied by the phase. The resulting distribution can be fourier analyzed,\nand the n-th harmonic component of this will be (assuming the coordinate system has been chosen\nappropriately):\nθwe\nNaIa\n=\nJzn = nπ Jz0 sin n 2\nπ R2\n2 -R2\nkwn\nwhere the n-th harmonic winding factor is:\nsin n θwe\nkwn =\nθwe\nn 2\nand note that θwe is the electrical winding angle:\nθwe = pθw\n\nNow, it is easiest to approach this problem using a vector potential. Since the divergence of\nflux density is zero, it is possible to let the magnetic flux density be represented by the curl of a\nvector potential:\nB = r × A\nTaking the curl of that:\nr × r × A = μ0J = rr · A -r2A\nand using the coulomb gage\nr · A = 0\nwe have a reasonable tractable partial differential equation in the vector potential:\nr2A = -μ0J\nNow, since in our assumption there is only a z- directed component of J, we can use that one\ncomponent, and in circular cylindrical coordinates that is:\n1 ∂ ∂Az\n1 ∂2\nr\n+\nAz = -μ0Jz\nr ∂r\n∂r\nr2 ∂θ2\nFor this problem, all variables will be varying sinusoidally with angle, so we will assume that\nangular dependence ejkθ. Thus:\n1 ∂ ∂Az\nk2\nr\n-\nAz = -μ0Jz\n(40)\nr ∂r\n∂r\nr2\nThis is a three-region problem. Note the regions as:\ni\nRi < r < R1\nw\nR1 < r < R2\no\nR2 < r < Rs\nFor i and o, the current density is zero and an appropriate solution to (40) is:\nAz = A+r k + A-r -k\nIn the region of the winding, w, a particular solution must be used in addition to the homoge\nneous solution, and\nAz = A+r k + A-r -k + Ap\nwhere, for k 6\n2,\n=\nμ0Jzr2\nAp = -4 -k2\nor, if k = 2,\nμ0Jzr2\nAp = -\nlog r -\n\nkAi Rk-1\n\n+\ni\n-kAi R-k-1\n-\ni\n=\nkAo Rk-1\no\n-k-1\n+\ns\n-kA- Rs\n=\nw\nk-1\nw\n-k-1\nμ0JzR2\no\nk-1\n\nA\n+\n+R2\nA- R2\n-\n=\nA R\no\n\n+ A R-k-\n\n4 -k2\n+\n-\n\n2μ0JzR2\n\n-kAw\n1 + Aw\n-k-1\no\nk-1\no\n-k-1\n+Rk-\nk\n- R2\n+\n=\n-kA R\n+ kA R\n4 -k2\n+\n-\nw\nk-1\nA R\n+ Aw R-k-1\nμ0JzR1\ni\nk-1\ni\n-k-1\n+\n-\n-\n=\nA+R1\n+ A R\n4 -k2\n-\nkAw Rk-1\n-\n+ kAw\n\n2μ0J R\n\n+\n- R-k-1\nz\n+\n=\n-kAi Rk-1 + k\nk2\n+\nAi\n- R-k-1\n\n-\nNote that we are carrying this out here only for the case of k = 2.

There are six free variables and corre\nspondingly there must be six of these boundary conditions. They are the following:\n- At the inner and outer magnetic boundaries, r = Ri and r = Rs, the azimuthal magnetic\nfield must vanish.\n- At the inner and outer radii of the winding itself, r = R1 and r = R2, both radial and\nazimuthal magnetic field must be continuous.\nThese conditions may be summarized by:\nby substituting its particular solution in at the beginning or by using L'Hopital's rule on the final\nsolution.

It is a fairly general analysis, which will be suitable for use\nwith either surface or in-slot windings, and for the magnet inside or the magnet outside case.\nThis is a two-dimensional layout suitable for situations in which field variation along the length\nof the structure is negligible.\nLayout\nThe assumed geometry is shown in Figure 11. Assumed iron (highly permeable) boundaries are\nat radii Ri and Rs. The permanent magnets, assumed to be polarized radially and alternately\n(i.e. North-South ...), are located between radii R1 and R2. We assume there are p pole pairs (2p\nmagnets) and that each magnet subsumes an electrical angle of θme. The electrical angle is just p\ntimes the physical angle, so that if the magnet angle were θme = π, the magnets would be touching.\nIf the magnets are arranged so that the radially polarized magnets are located around the\nazimuthal origin (θ = 0), the space fundamental of magnetization is:\nM = irM0 cos pθ\n(41)\nwhere the fundamental magnitude is:\nθme Brem\nM0 =\nsin\n(42)\nπ\nμ0\nand Brem is the remanent magnetization of the permanent magnet.\nSince there is no current anywhere in this problem, it is convenient to treat magnetic field as\nthe gradient of a scalar potential:\nH = -rψ\n(43)\nThe divergence of this is:\nr2ψ = -r · H\n(44)\nSince magnetic flux density is divergence-free,\nr · B = 0\n(45)\nwe have:\n\nR s\nRi\nR2\nR1\nFigure 11: Axial View of Magnetic Field Problem\nr · H = -r · M\n(46)\nor:\nr2ψ = r · M = 1 M0 cos pθ\n(47)\nr\nNow, if we let the magnetic scalar potential be the sum of particular and homogeneous parts:\nψ = ψp + ψh\n(48)\nwhere r2ψh = 0, then:\nr2ψp = 1 M0 cos pθ\n(49)\nr\nWe can find a suitable solution to the particular part of this in the region of magnetization by\ntrying:\nψp = Crγ cos pθ\n(50)\nCarrying out the Laplacian on this:\nr2ψp = Crγ-2\nγ2 -p 2\ncos pθ = 1\nr M0 cos pθ\n(51)\nwhich works if γ = 1, in which case:\nM0r\nψp =\ncos pθ\n(52)\n1 -p2\n\nand at r = R2:\n\np-1\n2p\n-p-1\np-1\n-p-1\nM0\n-pA3 R\n-\n-\n-\nRs R2\n=\np A2R2\n+ B2R2\np\n(63)\n1 -p2\n\np-1\n\np\n-p-1\n\np\np\n\nM0\n-pA3 R2\n+ Rs R\n=\n-\np A\n-\n2R\n-\nB2R--\n\n-\n+ M0\n(64)\n1 -p2\nSome small-time manipulation of these yields:\n\np\n2p\n-p\np\n-p\nM0\nA1\n\nR1 -Ri R1\n\n=\nA2R1 + B2R1 + R1\n(65)\n1 -p2\n\np\np\nA\n\nR + R\nR-p\np\ni\n\n-p\nM0\n\n=\nA2R1 -B2R1 + pR1\n(66)\n1 -p2\n\np\np\np\np\nM0\nA\nR-\n\nR -R2p\ns R-\n\n=\nA2R2 + B2\n2 + R2\n(67)\n1 -p2\n\nA\n\np\nR + R2pR-p\ns\n\np\nM\n=\nA2R2 -B R-p\n2 + pR2\n(68)\n1 -p2\n\nOf course this solution holds only for the region of the magnets: R1 < r < R2, and is zero for the\nregions outside of the magnets.\nA suitable homogeneous solution satisfies Laplace's equation, r2ψh = 0, and is in general of the\nform:\nψh = Arp cos pθ + Br-p cos pθ\n(53)\nThen we may write a trial total solution for the flux density as:\nRi < r < R1 ψ =\nA1rp + B1r -p cos pθ\n(54)\nM0r\nR1 < r < R2 ψ =\nA2rp + B2r -p +\ncos pθ\n(55)\n1 -p2\nR2 < r < Rs ψ =\nA3rp + B3r -p cos pθ\n(56)\nThe boundary conditions at the inner and outer (assumed infinitely permeable) boundaries at\nr = Ri and r = Rs require that the azimuthal field vanish, or ∂ψ = 0, leading to:\n∂θ\nB1 =\n-R2\ni\npA1\n(57)\nB3 =\n-Rs\n2pA3\n(58)\nAt the magnet inner and outer radii, Hθ and Br must be continuous.

Kirtley Jr.\nIntroduction\nElectric power systems usually involve sinusoidally varying (or nearly so) voltages and currents.\nThat is, voltage and current are functions of time that are nearly pure sine waves at fixed frequency.\nIn North America, most ships at sea and eastern Japan that frequency is 60 Hz. In most of the\nrest of the world it is 50 Hz. Normal power system operation is at this fixed frequency, which is\nwhy we study how systems operate in this mode. We will deal with transients later.\nThis note deals with alternating voltages and currents and with associated energy flows. The\nfocus is on sinusoidal steady state conditions, in which virtually all quantities of interest may be\nrepresented by single, complex numbers.\nAccordingly, this section opens with a review of complex numbers and with representation of\nvoltage and current as complex amplitudes with complex exponential time dependence. The dis\ncussion proceeds, through impedance, to describe a pictorial representation of complex amplitudes,\ncalled phasors. Power is then defined and, in sinusoidal steady state, reduced to complex form.\nFinally, flow of power through impedances and a conservation law are discussed.\nSecondarily, this section of the notes deals with transmission lines that have interesting behavior,\nboth in the time and frequency domails.\nComplex Exponential Notation\nStart by recognizing a geometric interpretation for a complex number. If we plot the real part on\nthe horizontal (x) axis and the imaginary part on the vertical (y) axis, then the complex number\nz = x+jy (where j = √-1) represents a vector as shown in Figure 1. Note that this vector may be\nrepresented not only by its real and imaginary components, but also by a magnitude and a phase\n∗ c2007 James L.

Note that the product of\ntwo numbers expressed as exponenentials is the same as the exponential of the sums of the two\nexponents:\nea eb = ea +b\n(8)\nNote that it is also true that the reciprocal of a number in exponential notation is just the exponential\nof the negative of the exponent:\n1 = e-a\n(9)\nea\nThen, if we have two numbers z1 = |z\nj\n1|e φ1 and z2 = |z\nj\n2|e φ2 , then the product of the two numbers\nis:\nz1z2 = |z1||z\n\n2|ej(φ1+φ2)\n(10)\nand the ratio of the two numbers is:\nz1 = |z1|ej(φ1-φ2)\n(11)\nz2\n|z2|\nThe complex conjugate of a number z = x + jy is given by:\nz∗ = x -jy\n(12)\nThe sum of a complex number and its conjugate is real:\nz + z∗ = 2Re(z) = 2x\n(13)\nwhile the difference is imaginary:\nz -z∗ = 2jIm(z) = 2jy\n(14)\nwhere we have used the two symbols Re(·) and Im(·) to represent the operators which extract the\nreal and imaginary parts of the complex number.\nThe complex conjugate of a complex number z = |z|ejφ may also be written as:\nz∗ = |z|e-jφ\n(15)\nso that the product of a complex number and its conjugate is real:\nzz∗ = |z|ejφ|z|e-jφ = |z|2\n(16)\n\nSinusoidal Time Functions\nA sinusoidal function of time might be written in at least two ways:\nf(t)\n=\nA cos(ωt + φ)\n(17)\nf(t)\n=\nB cos(ωt) + C sin(ωt)\n(18)\nA third way of writing this time function is as the sum of two complex exponentials:\nf(t) = Xejωt + X∗e-jωt\n(19)\nNote that the form of equation 19, in which complex conjugates are added together, guarantees\nthat the resulting function is real.\nNow, to relate equation 19 with the other forms of the sinusoidal function, equations 17 and 18,\nsee that X may be expressed as:\nX = |X|ejψ\n(20)\nThen equation 19 becomes:\nf(t)\n=\nX ejψejωt + X ∗e-jψe-jωt\n(21)\n|\n|\nj(ψ+ωt)\n|\n|\n∗e-j(ψ+ωt)\n=\nX e\n+ X\n(22)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n=\n2 X cos(ωt + ψ)\n(23)\n|\n|\nThen, the coefficients in equation 17 are related to those of equation 19 by:\nA\n|X|\n=\n(24)\nψ =\nφ\n(25)\nAlternatively, we could write\nX = x + jy\n(26)\nin which the real and imaginary parts of X are:\nx =\nX cos(ψ)\n(27)\n|\n|\ny =\nX sin(ψ)\n(28)\n|\n|\nThen the time function is written:\nf(t)\n=\nx(ejωt + e-jωt) + jy(ejωt\ne-jωt)\n(29)\n-\n=\n2x cos(ωt) -2y sin(ωt)\n(30)\nThus:\nA =\n2x\n(31)\nB =\n-2y\n(32)\nA\nB\nX =\n2 -j 2\n(33)\n\nIt is also possible to write equation 19 in the form:\nf(t) = Re(2Xejωt)\n(34)\nWhile both expressions (19 and 34) are equivalent, it is advantageous to use one or the other of\nthem, according to circumstances. The first notation (equation 19) is the full representation of that\nsinusoidal signal and may be used under any circumstances. It is, however, cumbersome, so that\nthe somewhat more compact version(equation 34) is usually used. Chiefly when nonlinear products\nsuch as power are involved, it is necessary to be somewhat cautions in its use, however, as we will\nsee later on.\nImpedance\nBecause it is so easy to differentiate a complex exponential time signal, such a way of representing\ntime signals has real advantages in electric circuits with all kinds of linear elements. In Section 1 of\nthese notes, we introduced the linear resistance element, in which voltage and current are linearly\nrelated. We must now consider two other elements, inductances and capacitances.\nThe inductance\n⊃⊃⊃⊃\nL\nC\nFigure 4: Inductance and Capacitance Elements\nproduces a relationship between voltage and current which is:\ndiL\nvL = L\n(35)\ndt\nIf voltage and current are sinusoidal functions of time:\nv =\nV ejωt + V ∗e-jωt\ni =\nIejωt + I∗e-jωt\nThen the relationship between voltage and current is given simply by:\nV = jωLI\n(36)\nThis is a particularly simple form, and as can be seen is directly analogous to resistance. We can\ngeneralize our view of resistance to complex impedance (or simply impedance), in which inductances\nhave impedance which is:\nZL = jωL\n(37)\nThe capacitance element is similarly defined. A capacitance has a voltage-current relationship:\ndvC\ni = C\n(38)\ndt\n\n⊃\n<\n+\n6 i(t)\n>\n\n<> R\n⊃\nL\nv(t)\n<\n⊃⊃\n-\n\nThus the impedance of a capacitance is:\nZC =\n(39)\njωC\nThe extension to resistive network behavior is now obvious.\nFor problems in sinusoidal steady\nstate, in which all excitations are sinusoidal, we may use all of the tricks of linear, resistive network\nanalysis. However, we use complex impedance in place of resistance.\nThe inverse of impedance is admittance:\nY = Z\nSeries and parallel combinations of admittances and impedances are, of course, just like those\nof conductances and resistances. For two elements in series or in parallel:\nSeries:\nZ =\nZ1 + Z2\n(40)\nY 1Y 2\nY\n=\n(41)\nY 1 + Y 2\nParallel:\nZ1Z2\nZ =\n(42)\nZ1 + Z2\nY\n=\nY 1 + Y 2\n(43)\n4.1\nExample\nSuppose we are to find the voltage v(t) in the network of Figure 5, in which i(t) = I cos(ωt).\nThe\nFigure 5: Complex Impedance Network\nexcitation may be written as:\ni(t) = I ejωt + I e-jωt = Re Iejωt\nNow, the complex impedance of the parallel combination of R and L is:\nRjωL\nR||jωL = R + jωL\nSo that, if v(t) is represented by:\n\nv(t)\n=\nV ejωt + V e-jωt\n=\nRe V ejωt\nThen\nRjωL\nV =\nI\nR + jωL\nNow: the impedance Z may be represented by a magnitude and phase angle:\nZ =\nZ ejφ\n| |\nωLR\n|Z|\n=\np\n(ωL)2 + R2\nπ\nωL\nφ =\n2 -arctan R\nThen, using relations developed here, v(t) may be written as:\nωLI\nv(t) = r\ncos(ωt + φ)\n\n1 +\nωL\nR\nNote that this expression represents only the sinusoidal steady state solution, and therefore does\nnot represent any starting transients.\nSystem Functions and Frequency Response\nIf we are interested in the behavior of a linear system such as the circuits we have been discussing,\nwe often speak of the system function. This is the (usually complex) ratio between output and input\nof the system. System functions can express driving point behavior (impedance or its reciprocal,\nadmittance) or transfer behavior. We speak of voltage or current transfer ratios and of transfer\nimpedance (output voltage related to input current) and transfer admittance (output current related\nto input voltage).\nThe system function may be expressed in a number of ways, often as a Laplace Transform. Such\nis beyond the scope of this subject. However, it is important to understand one way of expressing\nlinear system behavior, in the form of frequency response. The frequency response of a system is\nthe complex number that relates output of the system to input as a function of frequency. Usually\nit is expressed as a pair of numbers, magnitude and phase angle. Thus\nH(jω) = |H(jω)|ejφ(jω)\nSubjects in Signals and Systems or Network Theory often spend some time on how to obtain\nand plot the frequency response of a network in ways which are both useful and easy. For our\npurposes, a straightforward, perhaps even \"brute force\" approach will do. Consider, for example,\nthe circuit shown in Figure 6.\n\nr\nr\n\n1 mHy\n∩∩∩∩\n+\n<\n+\n>\n<\nVin\n> 1 kΩ Vout\n-\nr\n<\nr-\nFigure 6: Example Circuit for Frequency Response\nThis is just a voltage divider between an inductance and a resistance. We seek to find, and\nthen plot, the transfer ratio Vout/Vin of this network. A very little analysis yields an expression for\nthe transfer function, which is:\nVout(jω)\nR\n=\n=\nVin(jω)\nR + jωL\n1 + jω L\nR\nThe magnitude and angle of this function can be extracted in a number of ways. For the pur\npose of these notes, we have done the mathematics using MATLAB. The specific instructions for\nproducing the frequency response plot are shown in Figure 7. Funamentally what is done is to\ncompute the system function for a number of frequencies (note that we use a way of computing\nspecific frequencies which produces a uniform spacing on a logarithmic scale, and then plotting the\nmagnitude (also on a logarithmic scale) and angle of that system function against frequency.\nPhasors\nPhasors are not weapons. They are a handy geometric trick which help us understand the nature\nof sinusoidal steady state signals and systems. To start, consider the basis for complex exponential\ntime notation, the function ejωt. At any instant of time, this is a complex number: at time t = 0\nit is equal to 1, at time ωt = π\n2 it is equal to j, and so forth. We may describe this function\nas a vector, of length unity, rotating about the origin of the complex number plane, with angular\nvelocity ω. It has, of course, both real and imaginary parts, which are just the projections of the\nvector onto the real and imaginary axes.\nNow consider a sinusoidally varying signal x(t), which may be represented by:\nx(t) = X jωt\nX∗\ne-jωt\ne\n+\nThis is the sum of two numbers, complex conjugates, which are, as functions of time, rotating in\nopposite directions in the complex plane. The sum of the two is, of course, real. This is the same\ntime function as:\nx(t) = Re Xejωt\n(44)\nwhere the real part operator Re( ) simply takes the projection of the function on the real axis.\n·\nIt might be helpful at this point to remember one of the features of complex arithmetic. Mul\ntiplication of two complex numbers results in a third complex number which has:\n\nL=1e-3;\n% Set Parameter Values\nR=1000;\ne=3:.05:7;\n% This is a way of producing evenly\nf=10 .^ e;\n% spaced points on a logarithmic chart\nom=2*pi .* f;\n% Frequency in radians per second\nH = 1 ./ (1 + j*L/R .* om);\n% This is the frequency response\nsubplot(211);\nloglog(f, abs(H))\n% Plot of magnitude\nxlabel('Frequency, Hz');\nylabel('Magnitude');\ngrid\nsubplot(212);\nsemilogx(f, angle(H))\n% Plot of angle\nxlabel('Frequency, Hz')\nylabel('Angle')\ngrid\ntitle('Frequency Response of L-R')\nprint('freq.ps')\nFigure 7: MATLAB Program freq.m\n1. a magnitude which is the product of the magnitudes of the two numbers begin multiplied and,\n2. an angle which is the sum of the angles of the two numbers being multiplied.\nThus, multiplying a number by ejωt, which has a magnitude of unity and an angle which is increasing\nwith time at the rate ω, simply has the effect of setting that number spinning around the origin of\nthe complex plane.\nIt is therefore relatively easy to represent sinusoidally varying signals with just their complex\namplitudes, understanding that they also include ejωt, which provides time variation. The complex\namplitude includes not only the magnitude of the signal, but also a phase angle. Usually the phase\nangle by itself is of little use, and must be related to some time reference. That is, as we will see,\nit is the difference between phase angles that is important in most cases.\nImpedances and admittances are also complex numbers, so that phasors can be used to visualize\nthe relationship between voltages and currents in a network. The key here is that multiplication and\ndivision of complex numbers is the same as multiplication or division of magnitudes and addition\nor subtraction of angles.\n6.1\nExample\nConsider the simple network shown in Figure 9, and suppose that the current source is sinusoidal:\ni = Re Iejωt\nThe impedance of the R-L combination is a complex number:\n\nFrequency, Hz\nFrequency Response of L-R\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\nFrequency, Hz\nFigure 8: Frequency Response\nZ = R + jωL = 1 + j2\nNow: the impedance may be represented in the complex plane as shown in Figure 10.\nVoltage v is given by:\nv = Re V ejωt\nwhere:\nV = ZI\nThen the relationship between voltage and current is as shown in Figure 11. Note that the phase\nangle between voltage and current is the same as the phase angle of the impedance.\nNote that KVL may be represented graphically in the fashion of Figure 12.\nEnergy and Power\nFor any terminal pair with voltage and current defined as shown in Figure 13, power flow into the\nelement is:\np = vi\n(45)\n-2\n-1\nMagnitude\nAngle\n\n⊃\n\nZ\n\nR = 1Ω\n∧∧\n+\n∨∨\n6 is\nv\nωL = 2Ω\n-\n⊃\nFigure 9: Example Circuit\nIm(Z)\nZ\n\nRe(Z)\nFigure 10: Complex Impedance\nPower is expressed in Watts (W), and one Watt is the product of one Volt and one Ampere.\nEnergy transferred over an interval of time t0 to t1 is the integral of power:\nt1\nw =\nv(t)i(t)dt\n(46)\nt0\nEnergy is expressed in Joules, and one Joule is one Watt- Second. A Joule is also a Newton-Meter\n(force times distance), and therefore a Watt is a Newton-Meter per Second.\nConsider the behavior of the three types of linear, passive elements we have encountered:\n- Resistance: v = Ri, Instantaneous power is:\np = Ri2 = v\n(47)\nR\nIm( )·\nV\n\n-I Re( )·\nFigure 11: Voltage and Current\n\nIm(V )\nV\n\nV\n\nL\n\n-\nRe(V )\nV R\nFigure 12: Components of Voltage\n-i\n+\nv\nelement\n-\nFigure 13: Definition for Power\n-\n\nInductance: v = L di\ndt, Instantaneous power is:\n\ndi\ndi2\np = iL\n=\nL\n(48)\ndt\ndt\nThe quantity wL =\n\nLi2 may be interpreted as energy stored in the inductance, so that\np = dwL . We will need to refine this definition later, when we consider electromechanical\ndt\ninteractions or nonlinear elements, but it will do for now.\n- Capacitance: i = C dv\ndt , Instantaneous power is:\n\ndv\ndv2\np = vC\n=\nC\n(49)\ndt\ndt\nThe quantity wC = 1\n\nCv2 may similarly be interpreted as energy stored in the capacitance.\nNext, consider the power input to each of these three elements under sinusoidal steady state\nconditions:\n- Resistance: if i = I cos(ωt + θ), then\np =\nRI2 cos 2(ωt + θ)\n\nRI2\n=\n[1 + cos 2(ωt + θ)]\n(50)\n\nh\ni\nh\ni\nh\ni\nThus, average power into the resistance is:\nP = 1 RI2\n(51)\n- Inductance: if i = I cos(ωt + θ), then voltage is v = -ωLI sin(ωt + θ), and power is:\np =\n-ωLI2 cos(ωt + θ) sin(ωt + θ)\nωLI2\n=\nsin 2(ωt + θ)\n(52)\n-\nAverage power into the inductance is zero. Instantaneous energy stored in the inductance is\nwL = 1 LI2 cos 2(ωt + θ)\nand that has an average value:\n< wL >= 1 LI2\n(53)\n- Capacitance: if v = V cos(ωt + φ), then i = -ωCV sin(ωt + φ), and power is:\nωCV 2\np =\nsin 2(ωt + φ)\n(54)\n-\nwhich has zero time average. Energy stored in the capacitance is:\nwC = 1 CV 2 cos 2(ωt + φ)\nwhich has time average:\n< wC >= 1 CV 2\n(55)\nNow, consider power flow into a set of terminals in a situation in which both voltage and current\nare sinusoidal and have the same frequency, but possibly different phase angles:\nv(t)\n=\nV cos(ωt + φ)\ni(t)\n=\nI sin(ωt + θ)\nIt is necessary to revert to the original form of complex notation, as in equation 19, to compute\npower.\nv(t)\n=\n1 V ejωt + V ∗e-jωt\n(56)\ni(t)\n=\n1 Iejωt + I∗e-jωt\n(57)\nInstantaneous power is the product of voltage and current:\np = 1 V I∗ + V ∗I + V Iej2ωt + V ∗I∗e-j2ωt\n(58)\n\nh\ni\nThis is directly equivalent to:\np = 1 Re V I∗ + V Iej2ωt\n(59)\nThis is, in turn, expressible as:\np = 2|V ||I| [cos(φ -θ) + cos(2ωt + φ + θ)]\n(60)\nFrom this, we extract \"real power\", or time- average power:\nP = 2 Re [V I∗] = 2|V ||I| cos(φ -θ)\n(61)\nThe ratio between real power and apparent power Pa\nis simply:\npower factor = cos ψ =\n= 1\n2|V ||I| is called the power factor, and\ncos(φ -θ)\n(62)\nThe power factor angle ψ = φ -θ is the relative phase shift between voltage and current.\nThis expression for time- average power suggests a definition for something we might call complex\npower:\nP + jQ =\nV I∗\n(63)\nin which average power P is the real part. The magnitude of this complex quantity is the apparent\npower. The imaginary part is called reactive power. It has importance which will be discussed later.\nDifferent units are used for real, reactive and apparent power, in order to gain some distinction\nbetween quantities. Usually we will express real power in watts (W) (or kW, MW,...). Apparent\npower is expressed in volt-amperes (VA), and reactive power is expressed in volt-amperes-reactive\n(VAR's).\nTo obtain some more feeling for reactive power, expand the time- varying part of the expression\nfor instantaneous power:\npvarying = 2|V ||I| cos(2ωt + φ + θ)\nNow, using the trig identity cos(x + y) = cos x cos y -sin x sin y, and assigning x = 2ωt + 2φ and\ny = -ψ = θ -φ, we have:\npvarying =\nV I [cos 2(ωt + φ) + sin ψ sin 2(ωt + φ)]\n2|\n|| |\nThus, total instantaneous power is:\np =\nV I cos ψ [1 + cos 2(ωt + φ)] +\nV I sin ψ sin 2(ωt + φ)\n(64)\n2| || |\n2|\n|| |\nNow, if we note expressions for P and Q, we can re-write this as:\np = P [1 + cos 2(ωt + φ)] + Q sin 2(ωt + φ)\n(65)\nThus, real power P represents not only time average power but also the pulsations that go with\ntime average power. Reactive power Q represents energy exchange with zero average value.\n\n⊃\n7.1\nRMS Amplitude\nNote that, in all of the expressions for power used so far, a factor of 1\n\nappears. This is, of course,\nbecause the average value of the product of two sinusoids of the same frequency has a value of half\nof the products of their peak amplitudes multiplied by the cosine of the relative phase angle. It has\nbecome common to use a different measure of voltage amplitude, which is called root-mean-square\nor simply RMS. The proper definition for the RMS value of a waveform is somewhat complex,\nbut boils down to that value which, if it were DC, would dissipate the same power in a resistor.\nIt is possible to define RMS for any periodic waveform. However, since we will be dealing with\nsinusoids, the definition is even easier. Clearly, since power dissipated in a resistor is, in terms of\npeak amplitudes:\n1 V 2\nP =\n|\n|\n2 R\nthen the RMS amplitude must be:\nVRMS = |V |\n√\n(66)\nThen,\nV 2\nP =\nRMS\nR\nAs we will see, RMS amplitudes are the default for most situations: when a circuit is described as\n\"120 Volts A√C\", the designation virtually always means 120 Volts, RMS. The peak amplitude of\nthis is |V | =\n2 · 120 ≈170 volts. Often you will see sinusoidal waveforms expressed in the form:\nv =\n√\n2VRMS cos(ωt)\nin which VRMS is obviously the RMS amplitude.\n7.2\nExample\nConsider the simple network of Figure 14. We will calculate the instantaneous power flow into that\nnetwork in terms we have been discussing.\nAssume that the voltage source has RMS amplitude\n+\n<>\nv\n<> R\n⊃\nX\n-\n<\n⊃⊃\nFigure 14: Example Circuit\nof 120 volts and R and X are both 100 Ω. Then:\nv(t) = 170 cos ωt\nThe admittance of this network is:\nj\nY = 100 -100\n\nX\nInstantaneous Power Flow\nPower, Watts\n-50\n-100\nFrequency * Time, Radians\nFigure 15: Power Flow For Example Circuit\nso that the complex amplitude of current is:\nI = 1.7 -j1.7\nAnd then complex power is:\nP + jQ =\n170(1.7 + j1.7)\nReal and reactive power are, respectively: P = 144 W, Q = 144 VAR. This gives a power factor\nangle of ψ = arctan(1) = 45*. Then, instantaneous power is:\np = 144 [1 + cos 2(ωt -45*)] + 144 sin 2(ωt -45*)\nThis is illustrated in Figure 15.\nA Conservation Law\nIt is possible to show that complex power is conserved in the same way as we expect time average\npower to be conserved. Consider a network with a collection of terminals and with a collection of\ninternal branches. Instantaneous power flow into the network is:\npin =\nvi\nterminals\nNote that this expression holds for voltage and current expressed over any complete set of terminals.\nThat is, if it is possible to delineate the terminals of the network into a set of pairs, the voltages\nmight correspond to voltages across the pair, while currents would flow between the terminals of\neach pair.\nAlternatively, the voltages might correspond to single node-to-datum voltage, while\n\ncurrents would then be single input node currents. Since power can go only into network elements,\nit follows that the sum of internal branch powers must be equal to the sum of terminal powers:\nterm\nX\nvi =\n67)\ninals\nbra\nX\nvi\n(\nnches\nIf this is true for instantaneous power, it is also true for complex power:\nterm\nX\nV I =\nV I\n(68)\ninals\nbra\nX\nnches\nNow, if the network is made up of resistances, capacitances and inductances,\nX\nV I =\nV I +\nV I +\nV I\n(69)\nterminals\nresi\nX\nstances\nindu\nX\nctances\ncapa\nX\ncitances\nFor these individual elements:\n- Resistances:\nV I∗ = R|\n\nI|2\n- Inductances:\nV I∗ = jωL|I|2\n-\n\nCapacitances:\nV I∗ = -jωC|V |2\nThen equation 69 becomes:\nX\nV I =\nX\nR|I|2\n\nX\nI|2\n+ j\nωL|\n-j\nωC V 2\n(70)\nterminals\nresistances\ninductances\ncapa\nX\ncitances\n| |\nThen, identifying individual terms:\nX\nV I =\n2(P + jQ)\nTotal Complex Power into Network\nterminals\nX\n| | 2\nR I\n=\n2 P < pr >\nPower Dissipated in Resistors\nresistances\nj\nX\nωL|I|2 =\n4ω P < wL > Energy Stored in Inductances\ninductances\nj\nX\nωC|V |2 =\n4ω P < wC > Energy Stored in Capacitances\ncapacitances\nSo, for any RLC network:\nP + jQ =\n\nX\n< pr > +2jω\nX\n< wL > -\nX\n< wC >\n(71)\nresistors\ninductors\ncapacitors\n\nPower Flow Through An Impedance\nConsider the situation shown in Figure 16. This actually represents a number of important situ\nations in power systems, where the impedance Z might represent a transmission line, transformer\nor motor winding.\nOf interest to us is the flow of power through the impedance.

This is perhaps the simplest of transmission line models which\nrepresents only the inductive impedance of the line. Line inductance arises because currents in the\nline produce magnetic fields, and this is a fair model for most lines which are fairly 'short'. More\non that in the next section. This line has the impedance\nZ = jωL = jXL\nNow, switching to RMS amplitudes, so that V s =\n√\n2V 1 and V r =\n√\n2V 2, Then real and\nreactive power flow are:\n\n∗\n|V\ns\nV\nPs + jQs =\nV sI = j\n| -\nsV r\n∗\n\nXl\nPr + jQr\n=\nV rI∗ = j |\n\nV\n-\nr|2 -V ∗\nsV r\nXl\n\nI\nL\nV s\nV r\nFigure 17: Simplest Transmission Line Model\nNow if we assume that the voltages are of the form:\nV s =\nVsejφ\nV r =\nVrejθ\nand that the relative phase angle between them is φ -θ = δ and doing a little trig:\nVsVr sin δ\nPs =\nXL\nQs =\nV 2\ns -VsVr cos δ\nXL\nPr =\n- VsVr sin δ\nXL\nQr =\nV 2\nr -VsVr cos δ\nXL\nA picture of this locus is referred to as a power circle diagram, because of its shape.

This\nrepresents not only the fact that most transmission lines have, in addition to series inductance,\nparallel capacitance but also the fact that many transmission lines are shunt compensated. This\nmay be represented as a two-port network with the admittance parameters, using XL = jωL and\n-j\nXC = ωC , :\nY\n=\nss\njXL\n-jXC1\nY\n= Y\n=\nsr\nrs\njXL\nY\n=\nrr\njXL\n-jXC2\nIt is fairly clear that, for voltage sources at both ends, real and reactive power flow are:\nVsVr sin δ\nPs =\nXL\n\nQ\nVsVr cos δ\ns =\nVs\n\nXL\n-XC1\n\n-\nXL\nVsVr sin δ\nPr\n=\n-\nXL\n\nVsVr cos δ\nQr =\nVs\nXL\n-XC2\n-\nXL\nQ\nXC\nP\nδ\nV 2 1\nXL\nFigure 21: Power Circle, Equal Voltages, Compensation Offset\nThe power circle for this sort of line is similar to that of the simpler model, but the center is\noffset to smaller reactive component, as shown in Figure 21.\nAn interesting feature of transmission lines is illustrated by what might happen were the re\nceiving line to be open: in that case:\nV = V\nr\ns 1 -ω2LC\nDepending on the values of frequency, inductance and capacitance this could be arbitrarily\nlarge, and this is a potential problem, particularly for longer lines, as we will discuss in the next\nsection.\nTransmission Lines\nA transmission line is really a long, continuous thing. It has inductance which is really inductance\nper unit length multiplied by the line length, but it also has a continuous capacitance. We might\nattempt to represent a long transmission line as a series of relatively 'short' sections each represented\nby an inductance and a capacitance.\nThese 'lumped parameter' models for lines are actually\nused in many system studies, particularly in physical analog models called 'Transmission System\nSimulators'.\n(We built one of these at MIT in the 1970's).\nAfter the next section you might\ncontemplate the definition of 'short' for our purposes here, but generally each lumped parameter\ncapacitance and resistance pair would represent a few to a few tens of miles.\n11.1\nTelegrapher's Equations\nPeering at the model presented in Figure 22, one might divine that a proper representation of\nvoltage and current, both of which are functions of time and distance along the line, might be:\n\nL\nL\nL\nL\nC\nC\nC\nC\ns\nFigure 22: Transmission Line Lumped Parameter Model\n∂v\n∂i\n=\n-Ll\n∂x\n∂t\n∂i\n∂v\n=\n-Cl\n∂x\n∂t\nThese are known as the \"Telegrapher's Equations\" and represent the fact that inductance\npresents voltage drop along the line in proportion to rate of change of current and that capacitance\npresents a change in current along the line in proportion to rate of change of voltage.\nIt is not difficult to eliminate either voltage or current from these to produce a wave equation.\nFor example, take the cross-derivatives and substitute the second of these equations into the first\nto get:\n∂2v\n∂2v\n= LlCl\n∂x2\n∂t2\nNow: this equation is solved by arbitrary functions which are of the form:\nv(x, t) = v(x ± ut)\nwhere the wave velocity is:\nu = √LlCl\nSo now we can see that the voltage on the line is the sum of some waveform going in the\n'positive' direction and something else going in the 'negative' direction:\nv(x, t) = v+(x -ut) + v-(x + ut)\nThe same will be true of current, and substituting back into either of the telegrapher's equations\nyields:\ni(x, t) = Llu (v+(x -ut) -v-(x + ut))\nthe product of inductance times wave velocity has the units of impedance:\nLl\nLlu =\n= Z0\nCl\nThis is often referred to as the 'characteristic impedance' of the transmission line. This is also a\ncommonly used term: transmission cables are often referred to by their characteristic impedances.\nFor coaxial wires 50 to 72 ohms are common values. For high tension transmission lines somewhat\nhigher values are to be expected.\n\n11.2\nSurges on Transmission Lines\nConsider the situation shown in Figure 23. Here the left-hand end of the line is driven by a current\nsource with a pulse (illustrated is a square pulse). This is actually not too far from the situation\nthat transmission lines experience with lightning, which is usually representable as a current source,\ntypically of magnitude between 20 and 100 kA and duration of about 1μS. (Actually, it is not a\nsquare pulse but that is not important here).\nWhat will happen, if the pulse is short enough, is that it will launch a traveling wave in which\nv+ = Z0i+ and i+ is the current that was imposed. When this pulse reaches the far, or load end of\nthe line, we have the situation in which at that point:\nv(t)\n=\nv+ + v-\ni(t)\n=\nv\nZ\n+\n- V\nZ\n-\nand, of coures, v = Ri.\nThe 'reflected', or negative going wave will have magnitude:\nv\n= v+\n-\nR\nZ\nR\nZ\n-1\n+ 1\nIn the extreme case of an open circuit, the magnitude of the voltage pulse at the end of the\ntransmission line is exactly twice that of the propagating pulse. In the case of a short circuit, of\ncourse, the magnitude of the voltage is zero, the current in the short is double the current of the\npulse itself, and the pulse is reflected, but going in the reverse direction with a polarity the opposite\nof the forward-going pulse. This is illustrated in cartoon form in Figure 23.\nR\nI s\nv\ni\ni\nv\nv\ni\nR > Z\nR < Z\nFigure 23: Pulse Propagation on a Transmission Line\n11.3\nSinusoidal Steady State\nNow, consider a transmission line operating in the sinusoidal steady state. As suggested by Fig\nure 24, it is driven by a voltage source at one end and is loaded by a resistive load at the other.\nConsistent with the voltage and currents that we know can exist on such a line, we know they will\nbe of this form:\n\nn\no\n\nV\ns\nR\nFigure 24: Transmission Line in Simple Configuration\nv(x, t)\n=\nRe V +ej(ωt-kx) + V\nej(ωt+kx)\n-\ni(x, t)\n=\nRe\nV + ej(ωt-kx)\nV -ej(ωt+kx)\nZ0\n-Z0\nWhere the phase velocity is u = ω\nk = √L\nlCl .\nAt the termination end of the line, at x = l\nV\nV +e-jkl + V\nejkl\nR =\n= Z0\n-\nI\nV +e-jkl\nejkl\n-V -\nThis may be solved for the ratio of 'reverse' to 'forward' amplitude:\nV +e-2jkl Z\nR\n0 -1\nV\n=\n-\nR + 1\nZ0\nSince at the 'sending' end:\nVs = V + + V -\nWith a little manipulation it can be determined that\nh\n\ni\ne-jkl\nZ\nR\n0 + 1 +\nZ\nR\n0 -1\nV r = Vs\n\nZ\nR\n0 + 1 + e-2jkl\nZ\nR\n0 -1\nFurther manipulation yields:\nR\nV r = Vs R\nZ0\ncos kl + j sin kl\nZ0\nThis might be made a bit more comprehensible when turned into a magnitude:\nR\nVr\nZ0\n|Vs\n| = r\nR cos kl\n2 + (sin kl)2\nZ0\nIf the line is loaded with a resistance equivalent to the 'surge impedance' (so-called 'surge\nimpedance loading', the receiving end voltage is the same as the sending end voltage. If it is more\nheavily loaded, the receiving end voltage is less than the sending end and if it is less heavily loaded\nthe receiving end voltage is greater.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.061 / 6.690 Introduction to Electric Power Systems\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Kirtley Jr.\nIntroduction\nMost electric power applications employ three phases.\nThat is, three separate power carrying\ncircuite, with voltages and currents staggered symmetrically in time are used. Two major reasons\nfor the use of three phase power are economical use of conductors and nearly constant power flow.\nSystems with more than one phase are generally termed polyphase. Three phase systems are\nthe most common, but there are situations in which a different number of phases may be used.\nTwo phase systems have a simplicity that makes them useful for teaching vehicles and for certain\nservomechanisms. This is why two phase machines show up in laboratories and textbooks. Sys\ntems with a relatively large number of phases are used for certain specialized applications such as\ncontrolled rectifiers for aluminum smelters. Six phase systems have been proposed for very high\npower transmission applications.\nPolyphase systems are qualitatively different from single phase systems. In some sense, polyphase\nsystems are more complex, but often much easier to analyze. This little paradox will become ob\nvious during the discussion of electric machines. It is interesting to note that physical conversion\nbetween polyphase systems of different phase number is always possible.\nThis chapter starts with an elementary discussion of polyphase networks and demonstrates\nsome of their basic features. It ends with a short discussion of per-unit systems and power system\nrepresentation.\nTwo Phases\nThe two-phase system is the simplest of all polyphase systems to describe. Consider a pair of\nvoltage sources sitting side by side with:\nv1\n=\nV cos ωt\n(1)\nv2\n=\nV sin ωt\n(2)\n∗ c2003 James L.

To\ncompute the power flows in the system, it is convenient to re-write the voltages in complex form:\nFigure 1: Two-Phase System\nV2\nFigure 2: Phasor Diagram for Two-Phase Source\nIf each source is connected to a load with impedance:\nZ = Z ejψ\n| |\nthen the complex amplitudes of currents are:\nV\n-jψ\nI1\n=\ne\n|Z|\nV\n-jψ -j π\nI2\n=\ne\ne\n|Z|\nEach of the two phase networks has the same value for real and reactive power:\nP + jQ = |V |2\nejψ\n(6)\n2 Z\n| |\n\nh\ni\nh\ni\nor:\nP\n=\n|V |2\ncos ψ\n(7)\n2 Z\n| |\nQ =\n|V |2\nsin ψ\n(8)\n2 Z\n| |\nThe relationship between \"complex power\" and instantaneous power flow was worked out in\nChapter 2 of these notes. For a system with voltage of the form:\nv = Re V ejφejωt\ninstantaneous power is given by:\np = P [1 + cos 2(ωt + φ)] + Q sin 2(ωt + φ)\nFor the case under consideration here, φ = 0 for phase 1 and φ =\nπ\n2 for phase 2. Thus:\n-\np1\n=\n|V |2\ncos ψ [1 + cos 2ωt] + |V |2\nsin ψ sin 2ωt\n2 Z\n2 Z\n| |\n| |\np2\n=\n|V |2\ncos ψ [1 + cos(2ωt -π)] + |V |2\nsin ψ sin(2ωt -π)\n2 Z\n2 Z\n| |\n| |\nNote that the time-varying parts of these two expressions have opposite signs. Added together,\nthey give instantaneous power:\np = p1 + p2 = |V |2\ncos ψ\n|Z|\nAt least one of the advantages of polyphase power networks is now apparent. The use of a\nbalanced polyphase system avoids the power flow pulsations due to ac voltage and current, and\neven the pulsations due to reactive energy flow.\nThis has obvious benefits when dealing with\nmotors and generators or, in fact, any type of source or load which would like to see constant\npower.\nThree Phase Systems\nNow consider the arrangement of three voltage sources illustrated in Figure 3.\nThe three phase voltages are:\nva =\nV cos ωt\n= Re V ejωt\n(9)\n)\nvb =\nV cos(ωt -2\nπ )\n= Re\nh\nV ej(ωt-2\nπ i\n(10)\nvc =\nV cos(ωt + 2\nπ\nh\n2π i\n)\n= Re V ej(ωt+ 3 )\n(11)\nThese three phase voltages are illustrated in the time domain in Figure 4 and as complex\nphasors in Figure 5. Note the symmetrical spacing in time of the voltages. As in earlier examples,\nthe instantaneous voltages may be visualized by imagining Figure 5 spinning counterclockwise with\n\n+\n+\n+\nvc\nvb\n+\n+\n+\n\nV ej 2\nV e-j 2\nV\nva\n-\n-\n-\nπ\nπ\n-\n-\n-\nFigure 3: Three- Phase Voltage Source\n-1\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nVa, Vb, Vc\nt\nFigure 4: Three Phase Voltages\nangular velocity ω.

This current is given by:\nV\nin = ia + ib + ic = Re\ne jωt + e j(ωt-2π\n2π\n)\nj(ωt+\n+\n)\n= 0\n(20)\ne\nZ\nThis shows the most important advantage of three-phase systems over two-phase systems: a\nwire with no current in it does not have to be very large. In fact, the neutral connection may\nbe eliminated completely in many cases. The network shown in Figure 7 will work as well as the\nnetwork in Figure 6 in most cases in which the voltages and load impedances are balanced.\nva\nia\n-+\nva -\nFigure 7: Ungrounded Three-Phase Source and Load\nThere is a fundamental difference between grounded and undgrounded systems if perfectly\nbalanced conditions are not maintained. In effect, the ground wire provides isolation between the\nphases by fixing the neutral voltage a the star point to be zero. If the load impedances are not\nequal the load is said to be unbalanced. If the system is grounded there will be current in the\nneutral. If an unbalanced load is not grounded, the star point voltage will not be zero, and the\nvoltages will be different in the three phases at the load, even if the voltage sources all have the\nsame magnitude.\nLine-Line Voltages\nA balanced three-phase set of voltages has a well defined set of line-line voltages. If the line-to\nneutral voltages are given by (9 - 11), then line-line voltages are:\n-j 2\nπ\njωt\nvab =\nva -vb =\nRe V 1 - e\n(21)\ne\n-j 2π\nj 2π\njωt\n(22)\nRe V\n-1 ejωt\n(23)\nvbc =\nvb -vc =\n-\ne\ne\ne\nj 2\nπ\nRe V\nvca =\nvc -va =\ne\n\nand these reduce to:\nj π\njωt\nvab =\nRe\n√\nh\n3V e\n6 e\ni\n(24)\n=\n\n√\nh\n-j π\njωt\nvbc\nRe\nV e\ne\ni\n(25)\n=\n\n√\nh\nj 5π\njωt\nvca\nRe\nV e\ne\ni\n(26)\nThe phasor relationship of line-to-neutral and line-to-line voltages is shown in Figure 8. Two things\nshould be noted about this relationship:\n- The line-t√o-line voltage set has a magnitude that is larger than the line-ground voltage by a\nfactor of\n3.\n- Line-to-line voltages are phase shifted by 30* ahead of line-to-neutral voltages.\nClearly, line-to-line voltages themselves form a three-phase set just as do line-to-neutral voltages.\nPower system components (sources, transformer windings, loads, etc.) may be connected either\nbetween lines and neutral or between lines. The former connection of often called wye, the latter\nis called delta, for obvious reasons.\nVca\nVc\nVa\nVab\nVb\nVbc\nVbc\nVab\nVca\nVa\nVb\nVc\nFigure 8: Line-Neutral and Line-Line Voltages\nIt should be noted that the wye connection is at least potentially a four-terminal connection,\nwhile the delta connection is inherently three-terminal. The difference is the availability of a neutral\npoint. Under balanced operating conditions this is unimportant, but the difference is apparent and\nimportant under unbalanced conditions.\n4.1\nExample: Wye and Delta Connected Loads\nLoads may be connected in either line-to-neutral or line-to-line configuration. An example of the\nuse of this flexibility is in a fairly commonly used distribution system with a line-to-neutral voltage\nof 120 V, RMS. In this system the line-to-line voltage is 208 V, RMS. Single phase loads may be\nconnected either line-to-line or line-to-neutral.\n\n-\n-\n+\nVa\n-\n+\n-\nVca\nVab\nVb\n+\n-\n+\nV\n+\nc\n-\nV\n+\nbc\nFigure 9: Wye And Delta Connected Voltage Sources\na\na\nZa\nca\nZ\nZab\nZ b\nZ c\nb\nc\nZ bc\nb\nc\nFigure 10: Wye And Delta Connected Impedances\nSuppose it is necessary to build a resistive heater to deliver 6 kW, to be made of three elements\nwhich may be connected in either wye or delta. Each of the three elements must dissipate 2000 W.\nThus, since P = V\nR\n2 , the wye connected resistors would be:\nRy =\n= 7.2Ω\nwhile the delta connected resistors would be:\nRΔ =\n= 21.6Ω\nAs is suggested by this example, wye and delta connected impedances are often directly equiv\nalent. In fact, ungrounded connections are three-terminal networks which may be represented in\ntwo ways. The two networks shown in Figure 10, combinations of three passive impedances, are\ndirectly equivalent and identical in their terminal behavior if the relationships between elements\nare as given in (27 - 32).\nZab\nZaZb + ZbZ + Z Z\nc\nc\na\n=\n(27)\nZc\n\nZaZb + ZbZc + Z Za\nZbc =\nc\n(28)\nZa\nZaZb + ZbZ\nc\n=\nc + ZcZa\nZ a\n(29)\nZb\nZabZ a\nZa =\nc\n(30)\nZab + Zbc + Zca\nZabZbc\nZb =\n(31)\nZab + Zbc + Zca\nZb Zca\nZ\n=\nc\nc\n(32)\n\nZab + Zbc + Zca\nA special case of the wye-delta equivalence is that of balanced loads, in which:\nZa = Zb = Zc = Zy\nand\nZab = Zbc = Zca = ZΔ\nin which case:\nZΔ = 3Zy\n4.2\nExample: Use of Wye-Delta for Unbalanced Loads\nThe unbalanced load shown in Figure 11 is connected to a balanced voltage source. The problem\nis to determine the line currents. Note that his load is ungrounded (if it were grounded, this would\nbe a trivial problem). The voltages are given by:\nva =\nV cos ωt\n2π\nvb =\nV cos(ωt -\n)\n2π\nvc =\nV cos(ωt +\n)\nTo solve this problem, convert both the source and load to delta equivalent connections, as\nshown in Figure 12.

Their role is to convert electrical energy\nat one voltage to some other voltage. We will deal with transformers as electromagnetic elements\nlater on in this subject, but for now it will be sufficient to use a simplified model for the transformer\nwhich we will call the ideal transformer. This is a two-port circuit element, shown in Figure 14.\ni1\ni2\n-\nN1 : N2\n\n+\n+\nv1\nv2\n-\n⊃⊂\n-\nFigure 14: Ideal Transformer\nThe ideal transformer as a network element constrains its terminal variables in the following\nway:\n\nI-1\nN1 : N2\nI-2\n+\nV 1\n-\n⊃⊃⊃⊃\n⊂⊂⊂⊂\nZ\nv1\nv2\n=\n(33)\nN1\nN2\nN1i1\n=\n-N2i2\n(34)\nAs it turns out, this is not a terribly bad model for the behavior of a real transformer under\nmost circumstances. Of course, we will be interested in fine points of transformer behavior and\nbehavior under pathological operating conditions, and so will eventually want a better model. For\nnow, it is sufficient to note just a few things about how the transformer works.\n1. In normal operation, we select a transformer turns ratio N1 so that the desired voltages\nN2\nappear at the proper terminals. For example, to convert 13.8 kV distribution voltage to the\n120/240 volt level suitable for residential or commercial single phase service, we would use a\ntransformer with turns ratio of 13800 = 57.5. To split the low voltage in half, a center tap on\nthe low voltage winding would be used.\n2. The transformer, at least in its ideal form, does not consume, produce nor store energy. Note\nthat, according to (33) and (34), the sum of power flows into a transformer is identically zero:\np1 + p2 = v1i1 + v2i2 = 0\n(35)\n3. The transformer also tends to transform impedances. To show how this is, look at Figure 15.\nHere, some impedance is connected to one side of an ideal transformer. See that it is possible\nto find an equivalent impedance viewed from the other side of the transformer.\nFigure 15: Impedance Transformation\nNoting that\nN1\nI2 = -N2\nI1\nand that\nV 2 = -ZI2\nThen the ratio between input voltage and current is:\nV 1 = N1\nN2\nV 2 =\nN1\nN2\nI1\n(36)\n\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n⊃⊃⊃⊃\n⊂⊂⊂⊂\n@@ ⊃⊃⊃⊃\n⊂⊂⊂⊂\n@@ ⊃⊃⊃⊃\n⊂⊂⊂⊂\nThree-Phase Transformers\nA three-phase transformer is simply three single phase transformers. The complication in these\nthings is that there are a number of ways of winding them, and a number of ways of interconnecting\nthem. We will have more to say about windings later. For now, consider interconnections. On\neither \"side\" of a transformer connection (i.e. the high voltage and low voltage sides), it is possible\nto connect transformer windings either line to neutral (wye), or line to line (delta). Thus we may\nspeak of transformer connections being wye-wye, delta-delta, wye-delta, or delta-wye.\nIgnoring certain complications that we will have more to say about shortly, connection of trans\nformers in either wye-wye or delta-delta is reasonably easy to understand. Each of the line-to-neutral\n(in the case of wye-wye), or line-to-line (in the case of delta-delta) voltages is transformed by one\nof the three transformers. On the other hand, the interconnections of a wye-delta or delta-wye\ntransformer are a little more complex. Figure 16 shows a delta-wye connection, in what might be\ncalled \"wiring diagram\" form. A more schematic (and more common) form of the same picture is\nshown in Figure 17. In that picture, winding elements that appear parallel are wound on the same\ncore segment, and so constitute a single phase transformer.\nXc\nHc\nXb\nHb\nXa\nHa\nFigure 16: Delta-Wye Transformer Connection\nNow: assume that NΔ and NY are numbers of turns.

Taken consistently (uni\nformly on a line-neutral or uniformly on a line-line basis), impedances transform across transformers\nby the square of the voltage ratio, no matter what connection is used.\nPolyphase Lines and Single-Phase Equivalents\nBy now, one might suspect that a balanced polyphase system may be regarded simply as three\nsingle-phase systems, even though the three phases are physically interconnected. This feeling is\nreinforced by the equivalence between wye and delta connected sources and impedances. One more\nstep is required to show that single phase equivalence is indeed useful, and this concerns situations\nin which the phases have mutual coupling.\nIn speaking of lines, we mean such system elements as transmission or distribution lines: over\nhead wires, cables or even in-plant buswork. Such elements have impedance, so that there is some\nvoltage drop between the sending and receiving ends of the line. This impedance is more than just\nconductor resistance: the conductors have both self and mutual inductance, because currents in\nthe conductors make magnetic flux which, in turn, is linked by all conductors of the line.\nA schematic view of a line is shown in Figure 20. Actually, only the inductance components of\nline impedance are shown, since they are the most interesting parts of line impedance. Working in\ncomplex amplitudes, it is possible to write the voltage drops for the three phases by:\nV a1 -V a2\n=\njωLIa + jωM (Ib + Ic)\n(43)\nV b1 -V b2\n=\njωLIb + jωM (Ia + Ic)\n(44)\nV c1 -V c2\n=\njωLIc + jωM (Ia + Ib)\n(45)\nIf the currents form a balanced set:\nIa + Ib + Ic = 0\n(46)\nThen the voltage drops are simply:\nV a1 -V a2\n=\njω (L -M) Ia\nV b1 -V b2\n=\njω (L -M) Ib\nV c1 -V c2\n=\njω (L -M) Ic\n\nh\ni\nh\nh\nL\nM\nM\nM\nL\nL\nv\nv\nv\na2\nb2\nc2\nc1\nv\nb1\nv\na1\nv\ni\ni\na\nb\ni\nc\nFigure 20: Schematic Of A Balanced Three-Phase Line With Mutual Coupling\n-\nVb\n+\nVa\n-\n+\nV c\n-\n+\nN\nN\nN\nM\nM\nM\nL\nL\nL\nNY\nN Y\nNY\nR\nR\nR\nVoltage Source\nPrimary\nSecondary\nTransmission Line\nLoad\nTransformer\nFigure 21: Example\nIn this case, an apparent inductance, suitable for the balanced case, has been defined:\nL1 = L -M\n(47)\nwhich describes the behavior of one phase in terms of its own current. It is most important to note\nthat this inductance is a valid description of the line only if (46) holds, which it does, of course, in\nthe balanced case.\n7.1\nExample\nTo show how the analytical techniques which come from the network simplification resulting from\nsingle phase equivalents and wye-delta transformations, consider the following problem:\nA three-phase resistive load is connected to a balanced three-phase source through a\ntransformer connected in delta-wye and a polyphase line, as shown in Figure 21. The\nproblem is to calculate power dissipated in the load resistors. The three- phase voltage\nsource has:\njωt\nva =\nRe\n√\n2VRMSe\nj(ωt-2π i\n)\nvb =\nRe\n√\n2VRMSe\nj(ωt+ 2π i\n)\nvc =\nRe\n√\n2VRMSe\n\nThis problem is worked by a succession of simple transformations.\nFirst, the delta connected\nresistive load is converted to its equivalent wye with RY = R\n3 .\nNext, since the problem is balanced, the self- and mutual inductances of the line are directly\nequivalent to self inductances in each phase of L1 = L -M.\nNow, the transformer secondary is facing an impedance in each phase of:\nZY s = jωL1 + RY\nThe delta-wye transformer has a voltage ratio of:\nvp\nNΔ\n=\nvs\n√\n3NY\nso that, on the primary side of the transformer, the line and load impedance is:\nZp = jωLeq + Req\nwhere the equivalent elements are:\nNΔ\n(L -M)\nLeq\n=\nNY\n1 NΔ\n2 R\nReq\n=\nNY\nMagnitude of current flowing in each phase of the source is:\n√\n2VRMS\n|I| = q\n)2 + R2\n(ωLeq\neq\nDissipation in one phase is:\nP1\n=\n2|I| Req\nV 2\nRMSReq\n=\n(ωLeq)2 + Req\nAnd, of course, total power dissipated is just three times the single phase dissipation.\nIntroduction To Per-Unit Systems\nStrictly speaking, per-unit systems are nothing more than normalizations of voltage, current,\nimpedance and power.\nThese normalizations of system parameters because they provide sim\nplifications in many network calculations. As we will discover, while certain ordinary parameters\nhave very wide ranges of value, the equivalent per-unit parameters fall in a much narrower range.\nThis helps in understanding how certain types of system behave.\n\n? i1\n+\n+\nV\nv\n-\nZ\n-\nFigure 22: Example\n8.1\nNormalization Of Voltage And Current\nThe basis for the per-unit system of notation is the expression of voltage and current as fractions\nof base levels. Thus the first step in setting up a per-unit normalization is to pick base voltage and\ncurrent.\nConsider the simple situation shown in Figure 22.\nFor this network, the complex amplitudes\nof voltage and current are:\nV = IZ\n(48)\nWe start by defining two base quantities, VB for voltage and IB for current. In many cases, these\nwill be chosen to be nominal or rated values. For generating plants, for example, it is common to\nuse the rated voltage and rated current of the generator as base quantities. In other situations,\nsuch as system stability studies, it is common to use a standard, system wide base system.\nThe per-unit voltage and current are then simply:\nV\nv =\n(49)\nVB\nI\ni =\n(50)\nIB\nApplying (49) and (50) to (48), we find:\nv = iz\n(51)\nwhere the per-unit impedance is:\nIB\nz = Z\n(52)\nVB\nThis leads to a definition for a base impedance for the system:\nVB\nZB =\n(53)\nIB\nOf course there is also a base power, which for a single phase system is:\nPB = VBIB\n(54)\nas long as VB and IB are expressed in RMS. It is interesting to note that, as long as normalization is\ncarried out in a consistent way, there is no ambiguity in per-unit notation. That is, peak quantities\nnormalized to peak base quantities will be the same, in per-unit, as RMS quantities normalized to\nRMS bases. This advantage is even more striking in polyphase systems, as we are about to see.\n\n8.2\nThree Phase Systems\nWhen describing polyphase systems, we have the choice of using either line-line or line-neutral\nvoltage and line current or current in delta equivalent loads. In order to keep straight analysis in\nordinary variable, it is necessary to carry along information about which of these quantities is being\nused. There is no such problem with per-unit notation.\nWe may use as base quantities either line to neutral voltage VBl-g or line to line voltage VBl-l.\nTaking the base current to be line current IBl, we may express base power as:\nPB = 3VBl-gIBl\n(55)\nBecause line-line voltage is, under normal operation,\n√\n3 times line-neutral voltage, an equivalent\nstatement is:\nPB =\n√\n3VBl-lIBl\n(56)\nIf base impedance is expressed by line-neutral voltage and line current (This is the common\nconvention, but is not required),\nVBl-g\nZB =\n(57)\nIBl\nThen, base impedance is, written in terms of base power:\nV 2\nV 2\nPB\nBl-g\nBl-l\nZB = 3I2 = 3 PB\n=\nPB\n(58)\nB\nNote that a single per-unit voltage applied equally well to line-line, line-neutral, peak and RMS\nquantities. For a given situation, each of these quantities will have a different ordinary value, but\nthere is only one per-unit value.\n8.3\nNetworks With Transformers\nOne of the most important advantages of the use of per-unit systems arises in the analysis of\nnetworks with transformers. Properly applied, a per-unit normalization will cause nearly all ideal\ntransformers to dissapear from the per-unit network, thus greatly simplifying analysis.\nTo show how this comes about, consider the ideal transformer as shown in Figure 23.\nThe\n-\nI1\n1 : N\n-\nI2\n+\n+\nV 1\nV 2\n-\n⊃⊂\n-\nFigure 23: Ideal Transformer With Voltage And Current Conventions Noted\nideal transformer imposes the constraints that:\nV 2\n=\nNV 1\nI2\n=\nN I1\n\nNormalized to base quantities on the two sides of the transformer, the per-unit voltage and\ncurrent are:\nV 1\nv1\n=\nVB1\nI1\ni1\n=\nIB1\nV 2\nv2\n=\nVB2\nI2\ni2\n=\nIB2\nNow: note that if the base quantities are related to each other as if they had been processed by the\ntransformer:\nVB2\n=\nNVB1\n(59)\nIB1\n(60)\nIB2\n=\nN\nthen v1 = v2 and i1 = i2, as if the ideal transformer were not there (that is, consisted of an ideal\nwire).\nExpressions (59) and (60) reflect a general rule in setting up per-unit normalizations for systems\nwith transformers. Each segment of the system should have the same base power. Base voltages\ntransform according to transformer voltage ratios. For three-phase systems, of course, the voltage\nratios may differ from the physical turns ratios by a factor of\n√\n3 if delta-wye or wye-delta connections\nare used. It is, however, the voltage ratio that must be used in setting base voltages.\n8.4\nTransforming From One Base To Another\nVery often data such as transformer leakage inductance is given in per-unit terms, on some base\n(perhaps the units rating), while in order to do a system study it is necessary to express the same\ndata in per-unit in some other base (perhaps a unified system base). It is always possible to do this\nby the two step process of converting the per-unit data to its ordinary form, then re-normalizing it\nin the new base. However, it is easier to just convert it to the new base in the following way.\nNote that impedance in Ohms (ordinary units) is given by:\nZ = z1ZB1 = z2ZB2\n(61)\nHere, of course, z1 and z2 are the same per-unit impedance expressed in different bases. This could\nbe written as:\nV 2\nV 2\nB1\nB2\nz1\n= z2\n(62)\nPB1\nPB2\nThis yields a convenient rule for converting from one base system to another:\nPB1\nVB2\nz1 =\nz2\n(63)\nPB2\nVB1\n\n-\nxg\nxT 1\nxl\nrl\nxT 2\n∨∨\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n∧∧∧\n∩∩∩∩\n-\n+\neg\n-\nT\nLoad\nG\nL\nT2\n3-Phase\nFault\nFigure 24: One-Line Diagram Of Faulted System\n8.5\nExample: Fault Study\nTo illustrate some of the concepts with which we have been dealing, we will do a short circuit analysis\nof a simple power system. This system is illustrated, in one-line diagram form, in Figure 24.\nA one-line diagram is a way of conveying a lot of information about a power system without\nbecoming cluttered with repetitive pieces of data. Drawing all three phases of a system would\ninvolve quite a lot of repetition that is not needed for most studies. Further, the three phases can\nbe re-constructed from the one-line diagram if necessary. It is usual to use special symbols for\ndifferent components of the network. For our network, we have the following pieces of data:\nSymbol\nComponent\nBase P\nBase V\nImpedance\n(MVA)\n(kV)\n(per-unit)\nG1\nGenerator\n13.8\nj.18\nT1\nTransformer\n13.8/138\nj.12\nL1\nTrans.

This is\na symmetrical situation, so that only one phase must be represented. The per-unit impedance\ndiagram is shown in Figure 25.\nIt is necessary to proceed now to determine the value of the\ncomponents in this circuit.\nFigure 25: Impedance Diagram For Fault Example\nFirst, it is necessary to establish a uniform base an per-unit value for each of the system\ncomponents. Somewhat arbitrarily, we choose as the base segment the transmission line. Thus all\nof the parameters must be put into a base power of 100 MVA and voltage bases of 138 kV on the\n\n- At the generator |If | = 11, 595A\n- On the transmission line |If | = 1159A\n- At the fault |If | = 4633A\nline, 13.8 kV at the generator, and 34.5 kV at the fault.

Kirtley Jr.\nIntroduction\nInstallment 3 of these notes dealt primarily with networks that are balanced, in which the three\nvoltages (and three currents) are identical but for exact 120* phase shifts. Unbalanced conditions\nmay arise from unequal voltage sources or loads.\nIt is possible to analyze some simple types\nof unbalanced networks using straightforward solution techniques and wye-delta transformations.\nHowever, power networks can be come quite complex and many situations would be very difficult\nto handle using ordinary network analysis. For this reason, a technique which has come to be called\nsymmetrical components has been developed.\nSymmetrical components, in addition to being a powerful analytical tool, is also conceptually\nuseful. The symmetrical components themselves, which are obtained from a transformation of the\nordinary line voltages and currents, are useful in their own right. Symmetrical components have\nbecome accepted as one way of describing the properties of many types of network elements such\nas transmission lines, motors and generators.\nThe Symmetrical Component Transformation\nThe basis for this analytical technique is a transformation of the three voltages and three currents\ninto a second set of voltages and currents. This second set is known as the symmetrical components.\nWorking in complex amplitudes:\nva =\nRe V aejωt\n(1)\nvb =\nRe V bej(ωt-2\nπ )\n(2)\n∗2003 James L. Kirtley Jr.\nvc =\nRe V cej(ωt+ 2\nπ )\n(3)\nc\n\nThe transformation is defined as:\n⎡\nV 1\n⎤\n⎡\na\na2\n\n⎤⎡\nV a\n⎤\n⎢V\n⎥⎢\n⎥\n⎣\n=\na\na\n(4)\n⎢\nV b\nV\n⎥\n⎦\n⎣\n⎦⎣\nV c\n⎦\nwhere the complex number a is:\nj 2π\n√\na\n= e\n= -\n+ j\n(5)\na\n= ej 4π\n\n3 = e -j 2π\n√\n\n= - 2 -j\n(6)\na3\n= 1\n(7)\nThis transformation may be used for both voltage and current, and works for variables in\nordinary form as well as variables that have been normalized and are in per-unit form. The inverse\nof this transformation is:\n⎡\n⎤\n⎡\n⎤⎡\n⎤\nV a\nV 1\n⎢\n⎥\n⎢\n⎥⎢\n⎥\n⎣ V b ⎦ = ⎣ a\na\n1 ⎦⎣ V 2 ⎦\n(8)\nV\na\na2 1\nV 0\nc\nThe three component variables V 1, V 2, V 0 are called, respectively, positive sequence, negative\nsequence and zero sequence. They are called symmetrical components because, taken separately,\nthey transform into symmetrical sets of voltages.\nThe properties of these components can be\ndemonstrated by tranforming each one back into phase variables.\nConsider first the positive sequence component taken by itself:\nV 1 =\nV\n(9)\nV 2 =\n(10)\nV 0 =\n(11)\nyields:\nV a = V\nor\nva = V cos ωt\n(12)\n2π\nV\n= a 2V\nor\nvb = V cos(ωt -\n)\n(13)\nb\n2π\nV c = aV\nor\nvc = V cos(ωt +\n)\n(14)\nThis is the familiar balanced set of voltages: Phase b lags phase a by 120*, phase c lags phase\nb and phase a lags phase c.\nThe same transformation carried out on a negative sequence voltage:\nV 1 =\n(15)\nV 2 =\nV\n(16)\nV 0 =\n(17)\n\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ\nJ ]\nJ ]\n\nyields:\nV a = V\nor\nva = V cos ωt\n(18)\n2π\nV b = aV\nor\nvb = V cos(ωt +\n)\n(19)\n2π\nV\n= a 2V\nor\nvc = V cos(ωt -\n)\n(20)\nc\nThis is called negative sequence because the sequence of voltages is reversed: phase b now leads\nphase a rather than lagging. Note that the negative sequence set is still balanced in the sense\nthat the phase components still have the same magnitude and are separated by 120* . The only\ndifference between positive and negative sequence is the phase rotation. This is shown in Figure 1.\nVc\nVb\nJ\n-Va\nJ\n-Va\nVb �\nVc �\nPositive Sequence\nNegative Sequence\nFigure 1: Phasor Diagram: Three Phase Voltages\nThe third symmetrical component is zero sequence. If:\nV 1 =\n(21)\nV 2 =\n(22)\nV 0 =\nV\n(23)\nThen:\nV a = V\nor\nva = V cos ωt\n(24)\nV b = V\nor\nvb = V cos ωt\n(25)\nV c = V\nor\nvc = V cos ωt\n(26)\nThat is, all three phases are varying together.\nPositive and negative sequence sets contain those parts of the three-phase excitation that rep\nresent balanced normal and reverse phase sequence. Zero sequence is required to make up the\ndifference between the total phase variables and the two rotating components.\nThe great utility of symmetrical components is that, for most types of network elements, the\nsymmetrical components are independent of each other. In particular, balanced impedances and ro\ntating machines will draw only positive sequence currents in response to positive sequence voltages.\nIt is thus possible to describe a network in terms of sub-networks, one for each of the symmetrical\n\ncomponents. These are called sequence networks. A completely balanced network will have three\nentirely separate sequence networks. If a network is unbalanced at a particular spot, the sequence\nnetworks will be interconnected at that spot. The key to use of symmetrical components in handling\nunbalanced situations is in learning how to formulate those interconnections.\nSequence Impedances\nMany different types of network elements exhibit different behavior to the different symmetrical\ncomponents. For example, as we will see shortly, transmission lines have one impedance for positive\nand negative sequence, but an entirely different impedance to zero sequence. Rotating machines\nhave different impedances to all three\nPositive Sequence\nNegative Sequence\nFigure 2: Sequence Connections For A Line-To-Line Fault\nsequences.\nTo illustrate the independence of symmetrical components in balanced networks, consider the\ntransmission line illustrated back in Figure 20 of Installment 3 of these notes. The expressions for\nvoltage drop in the lines may be written as a single vector expression:\nV ph1 -V ph2 = jωLph Iph\n(27)\nwhere\n⎡\n⎤\nV a\n⎢\n⎥\nV ph = ⎣ V b ⎦\n(28)\nV c\n⎡\n⎤\nIa\n⎢\n⎥\nIph = ⎣ Ib ⎦\n(29)\nIc\n⎡\n⎤\nL\nM\nM\n⎢\n⎥\nL ph = ⎣ M\nL\nM ⎦\n(30)\nM\nM\nL\nNote that the symmetrical component transformation (4) may be written in compact form:\nV s = TV p\n(31)\n\nwhere\n⎡\na\na2\n\n⎤\nT =\n⎢ 1\na2\na\n⎥\n(32)\n3 ⎣\n⎦\nand V s is the vector of sequence voltages:\n⎡\nV 1\n⎤\nV s = ⎢V 2\n(33)\n⎣\nV\n⎥\n⎦\nRewriting (27) using the inverse of (31):\nT -1V s1 -T -1V\n-1\ns2 = jωL\nT\nI\n(34)\nph\ns\nThen transforming to get sequence voltages:\nV s1 -\nV\n-\ns2 = jωTL\nT\nIs\n(35)\nph\nThe sequence inductance matrix is defined by carrying out the operation indicated:\nL = TL\nT -1\n(36)\ns\nph\nwhich is:\n⎡\nL -M\n⎤\nL =\ns\n⎢\nL -M\n(37)\n\n⎣\nL + 2M\n⎥⎦\nThus the coupled set of expressions which described the transmission line in phase variables becomes\nan uncoupled set of expressions in the symmetrical components:\nV 11 -V 12 =\njω(L -M)I1\n(38)\nV 21 -V 22 =\njω(L -M)I2\n(39)\nV 01 -V 02 =\njω(L + 2M)I0\n(40)\nThe positive, negative and zero sequence impedances of the balanced transmission line are then:\nZ1 = Z2 = jω(L -M)\n(41)\nZ0\n= jω(L + 2M)\n(42)\nSo, in analysis of networks with transmission lines, it is now possible to replace the lines with three\nindependent, single- phase networks.\nConsider next a balanced three-phase load with its neutral connected to ground through an\nimpedance as shown in Figure 3.\nThe symmetrical component voltage-current relationship for this network is found simply, by\nassuming positive, negative and zero sequence currents and finding the corresponding voltages. If\nthis is done, it is found that the symmetrical components are independent, and that the voltage-\ncurrent relationships are:\nV 1 =\nZI1\n(43)\nV 2 =\nZI2\n(44)\nV 0 =\n(Z + 3Zg)I0\n(45)\n\na\nb\nc\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ g\nFigure 3: Balanced Load With Neutral Impedance\nUnbalanced Sources\nConsider the network shown in Figure 4. A balanced three-phase resistor is fed by a balanced\nline (with mutual coupling between phases). Assume that only one phase of the voltage source is\nworking, so that:\nV a =\nV\n(46)\nV b =\n(47)\nV c =\n(48)\nThe objective of this example is to find currents in the three phases.\nL\nVa\nVb\nVc\nR\nR\nR\nM\nM\nM\nL\nL\n+\n+\n-\n-\n+\n-\nFigure 4: Balanced Load, Balanced Line, Unbalanced Source\nTo start, note that the unbalanced voltage source has the following set of symmetrical compo\nnents:\nV\nV 1 =\n(49)\nV\nV 2 =\n(50)\nV\nV 0 =\n(51)\n\nFigure 5: Sequence Networks\nCurrents are:\nV\nI1 =\n3(jω(L -M) + R)\nV\nI2 =\n3(jω(L -M) + R)\nI0 =\nPhase currents may now be re-assembled:\nI a =\nI1 + I2 + I0\nIb =\na I1 + aI2 + I0\nI c =\naI1 + a I2 + I0\nor:\n2V\nI a =\n3(jω(L -M) + R)\n\n(a2 + a)V\nIb =\n3(jω(L -M) + R)\n\nNext, the network facing the source consists of the line, with impedances:\nZ1 =\njω(L -M)\n(52)\nZ2 =\njω(L -M)\n(53)\nZ0 =\njω(L + 2M)\n(54)\nand the three- phase resistor has impedances:\nZ1 =\nR\n(55)\nZ2 =\nR\n(56)\nZ0 =\n(57)\ninf\nNote that the impedance to zero sequence is infinite because the neutral is not connected back\nto the neutral of the voltage source. Thus the sum of line currents must always be zero and this\nin turn precludes any zero sequence current. The problem is thus described by the networks which\nappear in Figure 5.\njω(L -M)\njω(L -M)\njω(L + 2M) R\n\n∧∧∧\n∨∨\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n∩∩∩∩\n<>\n<>\n<\n<>\n<>\n<\n\n+\n-\nV\n+\nV\n+\nV\nR\nR\n-\n-\nPositive\nNegative\nZero\n\n-V\n=\n3(jω(L -M) + R)\n(a + a2)V\nI\n=\nc\n3(jω(L -M) + R)\n-V\n=\n3(jω(L -M) + R)\n(Note that we have used a2 + a = -1).\nRotating Machines\nSome network elements are more readily represented by sequence networks than by ordinary phase\nnetworks.\nThis is the case, for example, for synchronous machines.\nsynchronous motors and\ngenerators produce a positive sequence internal voltage and have terminal impedance. For reasons\nwhich are beyond the scope of these notes, the impedance to positive sequence currents is not the\nsame as the impedance to negative or to zero sequence currents. A phase-by-phase representation\nwill not, in many situations, be adequate, but a sequence network representation will. Such a\nrepresentation is three Thevenin equivalent circuits, as shown in Figure 6\n\n+\n-\nE1\n∩∩∩∩\njX1\nV 1\n+\n-\n\nI1\n∩∩∩∩\njX2\nV 2\n+\n-\n\nI2\n∩∩∩∩\njX0\nV 0\n+\n-\n\nI0\nPositive\nNegative\nZero\nFigure 6: Sequence Networks For A Synchronous Machine\nTransformers\nTransformers provide some interesting features in setting up sequence networks. The first of these\narises from the fact that wye-delta or delta-wye transformer connections produce phase shifts from\nprimary to secondary. Depending on connection, this phase shift may be either plus or minus 30*\nfrom primary to secondary for positive sequence voltages and currents. It is straightforward to\nshow that negative sequence shifts in the opposite direction from positive. Thus if the connection\nadvances positive sequence across the transformer, it retards negative sequence.\nThis does not\nturn out to affect the setting up of sequence networks, but does affect the re-construction of phase\ncurrents and voltages.\nA second important feature of transformers arises because delta and ungrounded wye connec\ntions are open circuits to zero sequence at their terminals. A delta connected winding, on the\nother hand, will provide a short circuit to zero sequence currents induced from a wye connected\nwinding. Thus the zero sequence network of a transformer may take one of several forms. Figures 7\nthrough 9 show the zero sequence networks for various transformer connections.\n\nXl\n∩∩∩∩\nFigure 7: Zero Sequence Network: Wye-Wye Connection, Both Sides Grounded\nXl\n⊃\nFigure 8: Zero Sequence Network: Wye-Delta Connection, Wye Side (Left) Grounded\nUnbalanced Faults\nA very common application of symmetrical components is in calculating currents arising from\nunblanced short circuits.

      "content": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\n6.061 Introduction to Power Systems\nClass Notes Chapter 5\nIntroduction To Load Flow ∗\nJ.L. Kirtley Jr.\nIntroduction\nEven though electric power networks are composed of components which are (or can be approxi\nmated to be) linear, electric power flow, real and reactive, is a nonlinear quantity. The calculation\nof load flow in a network is the solution to a set of nonlinear equations. The purpose of this note\nis to describe how network load flows may be calculated.\nThis is only an elementary treatment of this problem: there is still quite a bit of activity in the\nprofessional literature concerning load flow algorithms. The reason for this is that electric utility\nnetworks are often quite large, having thousands of buses, so that the amount of computational\neffort required for a solution is substantial. A lot of effort goes into doing the calculation efficiently.\nThis discussion, and the little computer program at the end of this note, uses the crudest possible\nalgorithm for this purpose. However, for the relatively simple problems we will be doing, it should\nwork just fine.\nPower Flow\nPower flow in a network is determined by the voltage at each bus of the network and the impedances\nof the lines between buses. Power flow into and out of each of the buses that are network terminals\nis the sum of power flows of all of the lines connected to that bus. The load flow problem consists\nof finding the set of voltages: magnitude and angle, which, together with the network impedances,\nproduces the load flows that are known to be correct at the system terminals. To start, we view\nthe power system as being a collection of buses, connected together by lines. At each of the buses,\nwhich we may regard as nodes, we may connect equipment which will supply power to or remove\npower from the system. (Note: in speaking of power here, we are really referring to complex power,\nwith both real and reactive components). If we have made a connection to a given system node\n(say with a generator), the complex power flow into the network at node k is:\nSk = Pk + jQk = VkI ∗\nk\n(1)\n∗ c2003 James L. Kirtley Jr.\n\n⎡\nZ1\n· · ·\n\n⎤\n⎢\n\n· · ·\nZ\n=\n⎢\n\nY`\n⎢\n⎥⎥\n(\n⎢\n· · ·\n2)\nZ\n⎥\n\n⎥\n⎣\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n⎦\nBus Admittance\nNow, if the network itself is linear, interconnections between buses and between buses and ground\ncan all be summarized in a multiport bus impedance matrix or its inverse, the bus admittance\nmatrix. As it turns out, the admittance matrix is easy to formulate.\nThe network consists of a number Nb of buses and another number N` of lines. Each of the\nlines will have some (generally complex) impedance Z. We form the line admittance matrix by\nplacing the admittance (reciprocal of impedance) of each line on the appropriate spot on the main\ndiagonal of an N` × N` matrix:\n\nInterconnections between buses is described by the bus incidence matrix. This matrix, which\nhas N` columns and Nb rows, has two entries for each line, corresponding to the buses at each end.\nA \"direction\" should be established for each line, and the entry for that line, at location (nb, n`) in\nthe node incidencd matrix, is a 1 for the \"sending\" end and a -1 at the \"receiving\" end. Actually,\nit is not important which end is which. The bus incidence matrix for the network described by\nFigure 1 below is:\n⎡\n⎤\n⎢ 0\n⎥\n⎢\n⎥\n⎢\n⎥\nNI = ⎢ -1\n⎥\n⎢\n⎥\n⎣ 0\n-1\n-1 ⎦\n-1\nIt is not difficult to show that the bus admittance matrix is given by the easily computed\nexpression:\nY = NI\nY`\nNI0\n(3)\nThe elements of the bus admittance matrix, the self- and mutual- admittances, are all of the\nfollowing form:\nIk\n(4)\nYjk = Vj\nwith all other voltages equal to zero.\nThus an alternative way to estimate the bus admittance matrix is to:\n- Assume that all nodes (buses) are shorted to ground,\n- Assume that one node is unshorted and connected to a voltage source,\n- Calculate all node currents resulting from that one source.\n- Do this for each node.\nWe may observe:\n\nX\nX\n- Reciprocity holds:\nYjk = Ykj\n(5)\n- Driving point admittance Ykk is just the sum of all admittances of lines connected to bus k,\nincluding any fixed impedances connected from that bus to ground.\n- Mutual admittance Yjk is minus the sum of the admittances of all lines connected directly\nbetween buses j and k. Usually there is only one such line.\nNetwork currents are then given by:\nI = Y\nV\n(6)\nWhere I is the vector of bus currents (that is, those currents entering the network at its buses. V\nrepresents the bus voltages and Y is the bus admittance matrix. We will have more to say about\nestimating the bus admittance matrix in another section. For the moment, note that an individual\nbus current is given by:\nN\nIk =\nYjkVj\n(7)\nj=1\nwhere N is the number of buses in the network. Then complex power flow at a node is:\nN\nSk = Vk\nY ∗\n(8)\njkVj\n∗\nj=1\nNow, the typical load flow problem involves buses with different constraints. It is possible to\nspecify six quantities at each bus: voltage magnitude and angle, current magnitude and angle, real\nand reactive power. These are, of course, inter-related so that any two of these are specified by the\nother four, and the network itself provides two more constraints. Thus it is necessary to, in setting\nup a load flow problem, specify two of these six quantities. Typical combinations are:\n- Generator Bus: Real power and terminal voltage magnitude are specified.\n- Load Bus: Real and reactive power are specified.\n- Fixed Impedance: A fixed, linear impedance connected to a bus constrains the relationship\nbetween voltage and current.\nBecause it constrains both magnitude and angle, such an\nimpedance constitutes two constraints.\n- Infinite Bus: This is a voltage source, of constant magnitude and phase angle.\nThe load flow problem consists of solving [8] as constrained by the terminal relationships.\nOne bus in a load flow problem is assigned to be the \"slack bus\" or \"swing bus\". This bus,\nwhich is taken to be an \"infinite bus\", since it does not have real nor reactive power constrained,\naccommodates real power dissipated and reactive power stored in network lines. This bus is nec\nessary because these losses are not known a priori. Further, one phase angle needs to be specified,\nto serve as an origin for all of the others.\n\nX\nX\nGauss-Seidel Iterative Technique\nThis is one of many techniques for solving the nonlinear load flow problem. It should be pointed out\nthat this solution technique, while straightforward to use and easy to understand, has a tendency\nto use a lot of computation, particularly in working large problems. It is also quite capable of\nconverging on incorrect solutions (that is a problem with nonlinear systems). As with other iterative\ntechniques, it is often difficult to tell when the correct solution has been reached. Despite these\nshortcomings, Gauss-Seidel can be used to get a good feel for load flow problems without excessive\nnumerical analysis baggage.\nSuppose we have an initial estimate (ok: guess) for network voltages. We may partition [8] as:\nSk = Vk\nY ∗\nj + VkY ∗\n(9)\njkV ∗\nkkVk\n∗\nj6=k\nNoting that Sk = Pk + jQk, we can solve for Vk\n∗ and, taking the complex conjugate of that, we\nhave an expression for Vk in terms of all of the voltages of the network, Pk and Qk:\n⎛\n⎞\nPk - jQk\nX\nVk =\n⎝\nV∗\n-\nYjkVj⎠\n(10)\nYkk\nk\nj6=k\nExpression [10] is a better estimate of Vk than we started with. The solution to the set of nonlinear\nequations consists of carrying out this expression, repeatedly, for all of the buses of the network.\nAn iterative procedure in which a correction for each of the voltages of the network is computed\nin one step, and the corrections applied all at once is called Gaussian Iteration. If, on the other\nhand, the improved variables are used immediately, the procedure is called Gauss-Seidel Iteration.\nNote that [10] uses as its constraints P and Q for the bus in question. Thus it is useable directly\nfor load type buses. For other types of bus constraints, modifications are required. We consider\nonly two of many possible sets of constraints.\nFor generator buses, usually the real power and terminal voltage magnitude are specified. At\neach time step it is necessary to come out with a terminal voltage of specified magnitude: voltage\nphase angle and reactive power Q are the unknowns. One way of handling this situation is to:\n1. Generate an estimate for reactive power Q, then\n2. Use [10] to generate an estimate for terminal voltage, and finally,\n3. Holding voltage phase angle constant, adjust magnitude to the constraint.\nAt any point in the iteration, reactive power is:\n⎧\n⎫\n⎨\nN\n⎬\n= Im\nY ∗\n(11)\nQk\nVk\njkVj\n∗\n⎩\n⎭\nj=1\nIt should be noted that there are other ways of doing this calculation.\nGenerally they are\nmore work to set up but often converge more quickly. Newton's method and variations are good\nexamples.\n\nFor buses loaded by constant impedance, it is sufficient to lump the load impedance into the\nnetwork. That is, the load admittance goes directly in parallel with the driving point admittance at\nthe node in question.\nThese three bus constraint types, generator, load and constant impedance are sufficient for\nhandling most problems of practical importance.\nExample: Simple-Minded Program\nAttached to this note is a MATLAB script which will set up carry out the Gauss-Seidel procedure\nfor networks with the simple constraints described here. The script is self-explanatory and carries\nout the load flow described by the simple example below.\nNote that, as with many nonlinear equation solvers, success sometimes requires having an initial\nguess for the solution which is reasonably close to the final solution.\nExample\nConsider the system shown in Figure 1. This simple system has five buses (numbered 1 through 5)\nand four lines. Two of the buses are connected to generators, two to loads and bus 5 is the \"swing\nbus\", represented as an \"infinite bus\", or voltage supply.\nFor the purpose of this excercise, assume that the line impedances are:\nZ0 =\n.05 + j.1\nZ1 =\n.05 + j.05\nZ2 =\n.15 + j.2\nZ3 =\n.04 + j.12\n(12)\nWe also specify real power and voltage magnitude for the generators and real and reactive power\nfor the loads:\n- Bus 1: Real power is 1, voltage is 1.05 per-unit\n- Bus 2: Real power is 1, voltage is 1.00 per-unit\n- Bus 3: Real power is -.9 per-unit, reactive power is 0.\n- Bus 4: Real power is -1, reactive power is -.2 per-unit.\nNote that load power is taken to be negative, for this simple-minded program assumes all power\nis measured into the network.\n\nn\nBus 1\nBus 3\nBus 5\nZ1\nZ2\nG1\nn\n-\n-\ninf\nBus 2\nBus 4\nZ3\nP1 + jQ1\nZ4\nG2\nn\nP2 + jQ2\n\nFigure 1: Sample System\n\n% Simple-Minded Load Flow Example\n% First, impedances\nZ1=.05+j*.1;\nZ2=.05+j*.05;\nZ3=.15+j*.2;\nZ4=.04+j*.12;\n% This is the node-incidence Matrix\nNI=[1 0 0 0;0 0 0 1;-1 1 1 0;0 0 -1 -1;0 -1 0 0];\n% This is the vector of \"known\" voltage magnitudes\nVNM = [1.05 1 0 0 1]';\n% And the vector of known voltage angles\nVNA = [0 0 0 0 0]';\n% and this is the \"key\" to which are actually known\nKNM = [1 1 0 0 1]';\nKNA = [0 0 0 0 1]';\n% and which are to be manipulated by the system\nKUM = 1 - KNM;\nKUA = 1 - KNA;\n% Here are the known loads (positive is INTO network\n% Use zeros for unknowns\nP=[1 1 -.9 -1 0]';\nQ=[0 0 0 -.2 0]';\n% and here are the corresponding vectors to indicate\n% which elements should be checked in error checking\nPC = [1 1 1 1 0]';\nQC = [0 0 1 1 0]';\nCheck = KNM + KNA + PC + QC;\n% Unknown P and Q vectors\nPU = 1 - PC;\nQU = 1 - QC;\nfprintf('Here is the line admittance matrix:\\n');\nY=[1/Z1 0 0 0;0 1/Z2\n0 0;0 0 1/Z3 0;0 0 0 1/Z4]\n% Construct Node-Admittance Matrix\nfprintf('And here is the bus admittance matrix\\n')\nYN=NI*Y*NI'\n% Now: here are some starting voltage magnitudes and angles\nVM = [1.05 1 .993 .949 1]';\nVA = [.0965 .146 .00713 .0261 0]';\n% Here starts a loop\nError = 1;\nTol=1e-10;\nN = length(VNM);\n% Construct a candidate voltage from what we have so far\nVMAG = VNM .* KNM + VM .* KUM;\nVANG = VNA .* KNA + VA .* KUA;\n\nV = VMAG .* exp(j .* VANG);\n% and calculate power to start\nI = (YN*V);\nPI = real(V .* conj(I));\nQI = imag(V .* conj(I));\n%pause\nwhile(Error>Tol);\nfor i=1:N,\n% Run through all of the buses\n% What we do depends on what bus!\nif (KUM(i) == 1) & (KUA(i) == 1),\n% don't know voltage magnitude or angle\npvc= (P(i)-j*Q(i))/conj(V(i));\nfor n=1:N,\nif n ~=i, pvc = pvc - (YN(i,n) * V(n)); end\nend\nV(i) = pvc/YN(i,i);\nelseif (KUM(i) == 0) & (KUA(i) == 1), % know magnitude but not angle\n% first must generate an estimate for Q\nQn = imag(V(i) * conj(YN(i,:)*V));\npvc= (P(i)-j*Qn)/conj(V(i));\nfor n=1:N,\nif n ~=i, pvc = pvc - (YN(i,n) * V(n));\nend\nend\npv=pvc/YN(i,i);\nV(i) = VM(i) * exp(j*angle(pv));\nend\n% probably should have more cases\nend\n% one shot through voltage list: check error\n% Now calculate currents indicated by this voltage expression\nI = (YN*V);\n% For error checking purposes, compute indicated power\nPI = real(V .* conj(I));\nQI = imag(V .* conj(I));\n% Now we find out how close we are to desired conditions\nPERR = (P-PI) .* PC;\nQERR = (Q-QI) .* QC;\nError = sum(abs(PERR) .^2 + abs(QERR) .^2);\nend\nfprintf('Here are the voltages\\n')\nV\nfprintf('Real Power\\n')\nP\nfprintf('Reactive Power\\n')\nQ\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.061 / 6.690 Introduction to Electric Power Systems\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Kirtley Jr.\nIntroduction\nIn this chapter we describe an equivalence between electric and magnetic circuits and in turn a\nmethod of describing and analyzing magnetic field systems which can be described in magnetic\ncircuit fashion. As it turns out, the equivalence is a fair approximation to reality and may be used\nwith some confidence.\nMagnetic circuits are those parts of devices that employ magnetic flux to either induce voltage or\nproduce force. Such devices include transformers, motors, generators and other actuators (including\nthings such as solenoid actuators and loudspeakers). In such devices it is necessary to produce\nand guide magnetic flux. This is usually done with pieces of ferromagnetic material (which has\npermeability very much larger than free space). In this sense, magnetic circuits are like electric\ncircuits in which conductive material such as aluminum or copper has high electric conductivity\nand are used to guide electric current.\nThe analogies between electric and magnetic circuits are two: the electric circuit quantity of\ncurrent is analogous to magnetic circuit quantity flux. (Both of these quantities are 'solenoidal' in\nthe sense that they have no divergence). The electric circuit quantity of voltage, or electomotive\nforce (EMF) is analogous to the magnetic circuit quantity of magnetomotive force (MMF). EMF\nis the integral of electric field E~, MMF is the integral of magnetic field H~ .\nElectric Circuits and Kirchoff's Laws\n2.1\nConservation of Charge and KCL\nTo begin with, consider the law of Conservation of Charge:\n∗2003 James L. Kirtley Jr.\nd Z\nqdv = 0\n\nJ~ · d~a = dt vol\nc\n\nZZ\nX\nI\nZZ\nX\nThis assumes, of course, that there is no accumulation of charge anywhere in the system. This\nis not a wonderful assumption for any systems with capacitor plates, but if one considers capacitors\nto be circuit elements so that both plates of a capacitor are part of any given element the right\nhand side of this expression really is zero.\nThsn, if we note current to be the integral of current density: Over some area, a fraction of the\nwhole area around a node:\nik =\nAk J~ · d~a\nthen we have:\nik = 0\nk\n2.2\nFaraday's Law\n:\nd ZZ\nE~ · d~` = -\nB~ · d~a\ndt\nThe left-hand integral may be taken to be a number of sub-integrals, each denoted by a discrete\nfractional integral:\nZ bk\nvk =\nE~ · d`\nak\nIf we assume that there are no substantive flux linkages among the circuit elements:\nB~ = 0\nthen we have KVL:\nvk = 0\nk\n2.3\nOhm's Law\nAt this point it is probably appropriate to note that Ohm's Law can be used to derive the consti\ntutive relationship for a resistor. Suppose we have a conductive element similar to the rectangular\nsolid shown in Figure 1. Assume current is confined in this element and flowing perpendicular to\nthe flat end shown in the figure. Current density is\nI\nJx = hw\nwhere I is to total current and h and w are height and width of the conductor, respectively.\nElectric field along the length of the element is:\nJx\nEx = σ\n\nZ\nZZ\nX\nwhere σ is the electrical conductivity of the material. Voltage developed is:\nJx\nvk =\nExd` =\nl\nσ\nWhich leads us to an expression for element resistance:\nv\nl\nR =\n=\nI\nhwσ\nw\nl\nx\nI\nh\n-\n+\nV\nFigure 1: Simple circuit element\nMagnetic Circuits\nAs it turns out, magnetic circuits are very similar and are governed by laws that are not at all\ndifferent from those of electric circuits, with only one minor difference.\n3.1\nConservation of Flux: Gauss' Law\nTo start, Gauss' law is:\n\nB~ · d~a = 0\nThis reflects that notion that there are no sources of flux: this is a truely sinusoidal quantity.\nIt neither begins nor ends but just goes in circles.\nIf we note a fraction of the surface around a node and call it surface k, the flux through that\nsurface is:\nΦk =\nZZ\nAk B~ · d~a\nIf we take the sum of all partial fluxes through a surface surrounding a note we come to the\nanalog of KCL:\nΦk = 0\nk\n\nI\nZZ\nZZ\nX\n3.2\nMMF: Ampere's Law\nAmpere's Law is simply stated as:\nH~ · d` =\nJ~ · d~a\nThe integral of current density J~ is current, quantified in the SI system as Amperes. As it is\ngenerally carried in wires which might number, say , N, it is often quantified as:\nJ~ · d~a = NI\nFor this we will often use the term MagnetoMotive Force or MMF, which gets the symbol F. If\nwe use that symbol to denote the integral of magnetic field over a magnetic circuit element:\nZ bk\nFk =\nH~ · d`~\nak\nThen, if we take enough of these subintegrals to cover the loop around a group of elements, we\nhave\nFk = NI\nk\nNote that this is not exactly the same as KVL, as it has a source term on the right.\n3.3\nMagnetic Circuit Element: Analogy to Ohm's Law\nMagnetic circuits have an equivalent to resistance. It is the ratio of MMF to flux and has the\nsymbol R. I direct comparison with the derivation of resistance, a magnetic circuit element is\nshown in Figure 2.\nw\nl\nx\nh\n-\n+\nF\nΦ\nFigure 2: Magnetic circuit element\nAssume that the material of this element has permeability μ > μ0, so that it has a constitutive\nrelationship:\n\nBx = μHx\nIf flux density in the material is uniform, total flux through the element is:\nΦ = hwBx = hwμHx\nAnd the MMF is simply the integral of magnetic field H from one end to the other: again we\nassume uniformity so that:\nF = `Hx\nThe reluctance of this element is then:\nF\n`\nR =\n=\nΦ\nhwμ\n3.4\nMagnetic Gaps\nIn reality, magnetic circuits tend to be made up of very highly permeable elements (pieces of iron)\nand relatively small air-gaps. A sketch of such a gap is shown in Figure 3.\nμ\nμ\nw\nh\ng\nFigure 3: Gap between magnetic elements\nIt is usually permissible to assume that iron elements have very high permeability (μ →inf), so\nthat there is negligible MMF drop. In this sense the iron elements serve in the same role as copper\nor aluminum wire in electric circuits. The gap, on the other hand, has reluctance:\ng\nRg = hwμ0\n\nI\nμ\nμ\nH\nH\na\nm\nB g\nBm\nFringing Field\nFigure 4: Gap details\n3.5\nBoundary Conditions\nShown in Figure 4 is the cross-section of a gap. It is assumed that the elements shown have some\ndepth into the paper which is greater than the gap width g. If the permeability of the elements to\nthe right and the left is very high, we say that magnetic flux is largely confined to those elements.\nNote that the boundary condition associated with Ampere's Law dictates that the magnetic field\nintensity Ha in the air adjacent to the permeable material and parallel with the surface must be\nequal to the magnetic field intensity Hm just inside the magnetic material and parallel with the\nsurface. If the material is very highly permeable (μ →inf), that magnetic field must be nearly zero:\nHa = Hm → 0. This means that magnetic field must be perpendicular to the surface of very highly\npermeable material. This is the case in the gap itself, where:\nBg = Bm\nWe should note, however, that there will be 'fringing' fields in the region near the gap, so that our\nexpression for the reluctance of the gap will not be quite correct. The accuracy of the expression\nwhich ignores fringing is best for really small gaps and generally over-estimates the reluctance.\nFaraday's Law and Inductance\nChanging magnetic fields give rise to electric fields and consequently produce voltage. This is how\ninductance works. Consider the situation shown rather abstractly in Figure 5.\nFaraday's Law is, in integral form:\nd ZZ\nE~ · d` = -\nB~ · ~nda\nArea\ndt\nIf the contour shown is highly conducting (say, if it is a wire), there is zero electric field over\nthat part of the contour. Voltage across the terminals is:\nZ b\nVab =\nE~ · d`\na\nand that is the whole of the integral above. Thus we may conclude that:\n\nV\n+\n-\ndl\nn\nb\na\ni\nFigure 5: Loop for Faraday's Law\nd ZZ\nVab = -\nArea B~ · ~nda\ndt\nNow, if we define flux linked by this contour to be:\nλ = -\nZZ\nArea B~ · ~nda\nthen voltage is, as we expect:\ndλ\nVab = dt\nAs it turns out, current flowing in the wire with sense shown by i in Figure 5 tends to produce\nflux with sense opposite to the normal vector shown in that figure, and so produces positive flux.\nGenerally, in calculating inductance, one uses the 'right hand rule' in determing the direction of\nflux linkage: if the fingers of your right hand follow the direction of the winding, from the positive\nterminal, positive flux is in the direction of your thumb.\n4.1\nExample: Solenoid Actuator\nShown in Figure 6 is a representation of a common solenoid actuator. When current is put through\nthe coil a magnetic flux appears in the gaps and pulls the plunger to the left. We will examine the\nforce and how to calculate it in later chapters. For now, however, we are concerned with magnetic\nfields in the device and with the calculation of inductance. Assume that the stator and plunger\nare both made of highly permeable materials (μ →inf). If the coil carries current I in N turns in\nthe sense shown, magnetic flux will cross the narrow air-gap to the right in the direction from the\nstator to the plunger and then return in the sense shown in the variable length gap of width x. It\nis clear that this is also positive sense flux for the coil.\nThe magnetic circuit equivalent is shown in Figure 7.\nAll of the flux produced crosses the\nvariable width gap which has reluctance:\n\nDepth D perpendicular to view\nNI\nB\nw\nμ\nh\nx\nCoil\ng\nStator\nPlunger\nFigure 6: Cross-Section of Solenoid Actuator\nF\nΦ\ng\ng\nx\nFigure 7: Magnetic Equivalent Circuit of Solenoid Actuator\nx\nRx = μ0hD\nHalf of the flux crosses each of the other two gaps, which are in parallel and have reluctance:\ng\nRg = μ0wD\nTotal flux in the magnetic circuit is\nF\nΦ = Rx + 1\n2 Rg\nAnd since λ = NΦ and F = NI, the inductance of this structure is:\nN 2\nN 2\nL =\n=\nR\nRx + 1\n2 Rg\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.061 / 6.690 Introduction to Electric Power Systems\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Kirtley Jr.\nIntroduction\nThis section of notes discusses some of the fundamental processes involved in electric machin\nery. In the section on energy conversion processes we examine the two major ways of estimating\nelectromagnetic forces: those involving thermodynamic arguments (conservation of energy) and\nfield methods (Maxwell's Stress Tensor). In between these two explications is a bit of description\nof electric machinery, primarily there to motivate the description of field based force calculating\nmethods.\nThe subsection of the notes dealing with losses is really about eddy currents in both linear and\nnonlinear materials and about semi-empirical ways of handling iron losses and exciting currents in\nmachines.\nEnergy Conversion Process:\nIn a motor the energy conversion process can be thought of in simple terms. In \"steady state\",\nelectric power input to the machine is just the sum of electric power inputs to the different phase\nterminals:\nPe =\nviii\ni\nMechanical power is torque times speed:\nPm = T Ω\nAnd the sum of the losses is the difference:\nPd = Pe -Pm\n∗ c2003 James L. Kirtley Jr.\n\nMechanical\nElectro-\nConverter\nMechanical Power Out\nElectric Power In\nLosses: Heat, Noise, Windage,...\nFigure 1: Energy Conversion Process\nIt will sometimes be convenient to employ the fact that, in most machines, dissipation is small\nenough to approximate mechanical power with electrical power. In fact, there are many situations in\nwhich the loss mechanism is known well enough that it can be idealized away. The \"thermodynamic\"\narguments for force density take advantage of this and employ a \"conservative\" or lossless energy\nconversion system.\n2.1\nEnergy Approach to Electromagnetic Forces:\nMagnetic Field\nSystem\n+\nv\n-\nf\nx\nFigure 2: Conservative Magnetic Field System\nTo start, consider some electromechanical system which has two sets of \"terminals\", electrical\nand mechanical, as shown in Figure 2. If the system stores energy in magnetic fields, the energy\nstored depends on the state of the system, defined by (in this case) two of the identifiable variables:\nflux (λ), current (i) and mechanical position (x). In fact, with only a little reflection, you should\nbe able to convince yourself that this state is a single-valued function of two variables and that the\nenergy stored is independent of how the system was brought to this state.\nNow, all electromechanical converters have loss mechanisms and so are not themselves conser\nvative. However, the magnetic field system that produces force is, in principle, conservative in the\nsense that its state and stored energy can be described by only two variables. The \"history\" of the\nsystem is not important.\nIt is possible to chose the variables in such a way that electrical power into this conservative\n\nZ\nX\nZ\nsystem is:\ndλ\nP e = vi = i dt\nSimilarly, mechanical power out of the system is:\ndx\nP m\nfe\n=\ndt\nThe difference between these two is the rate of change of energy stored in the system:\ndWm = P e -P m\ndt\nIt is then possible to compute the change in energy required to take the system from one state to\nanother by:\na\nWm(a) -Wm(b) =\nidλ -fedx\nb\nwhere the two states of the system are described by a = (λa, xa) and b = (λb, xb)\nIf the energy stored in the system is described by two state variables, λ and x, the total\ndifferential of stored energy is:\n∂Wm\n∂Wm\ndWm =\ndλ +\ndx\n∂λ\n∂x\nand it is also:\ndWm = idλ -fedx\nSo that we can make a direct equivalence between the derivatives and:\n∂Wm\nfe = - ∂x\nThis generalizes in the case of multiple electrical terminals and/or multiple mechanical termi\nnals. For example, a situation with multiple electrical terminals will have:\ndWm =\nikdλk -fedx\nk\nAnd the case of rotary, as opposed to linear, motion has in place of force fe and displacement\nx, torque T e and angular displacement θ.\nIn many cases we might consider a system which is electricaly linear, in which case inductance\nis a function only of the mechanical position x.\nλ(x) = L(x)i\nIn this case, assuming that the energy integral is carried out from λ = 0 (so that the part of the\nintegral carried out over x is zero),\nλ\n1 λ2\nWm =\nλdλ =\n0 L(x)\n2 L(x)\nThis makes\n∂\nfe = -2 λ2\n∂x L(x)\n\nX\nX\nNote that this is numerically equivalent to\n∂\nfe = -2 i2\n∂x L(x)\nThis is true only in the case of a linear system. Note that substituting L(x)i = λ too early in the\nderivation produces erroneous results: in the case of a linear system it is a sign error, but in the\ncase of a nonlinear system it is just wrong.\n2.1.1\nCoenergy\nWe often will describe systems in terms of inductance rather than its reciprocal, so that current,\nrather than flux, appears to be the relevant variable.\nIt is convenient to derive a new energy\nvariable, which we will call co-energy, by:\nW =\nλiii -Wm\nm\ni\nand in this case it is quite easy to show that the energy differential is (for a single mechanical\nvariable) simply:\ndW =\nm\nk\nλkdik + fedx\nso that force produced is:\n∂Wm\nfe =\n∂x\nConsider a simple electric machine example in which there is a single winding on a rotor (call\nit the field winding and a polyphase armature. Suppose the rotor is round so that we can describe\nthe flux linkages as:\nλa\n=\nLaia + Labib + Labic + M cos(pθ)if\n2π\nλb\n=\nLabia + Laib + Labic + M cos(pθ -\n)if\n2π\nλc\n=\nLabia + Labib + Laic + M cos(pθ +\n)if\n2π\n2π\nλf\n=\nM cos(pθ)ia + M cos(pθ -\n)ib + M cos(pθ +\n) + Lfif\nNow, this system can be simply described in terms of coenergy. With multiple excitation it\nis important to exercise some care in taking the coenergy integral (to ensure that it is taken over\na valid path in the multi-dimensional space). In our case there are actually five dimensions, but\nonly four are important since we can position the rotor with all currents at zero so there is no\ncontribution to coenergy from setting rotor position. Suppose the rotor is at some angle θ and that\nthe four currents have values ia0, ib0, ic0 and if0. One of many correct path integrals to take would\nbe:\nZ ia0\nW\n=\n+\nLaiadia\nZ ib0\n(Labia0 + Laib) dib\nm\n\nThe result is:\n\nW m\n=\nLa i2\na0 + i2\nb0 + ico\n\n+ Lab (iaoib0 + iaoic0 + icoib0)\n\n2π\n2π\n+\ni\ni\ncos(pθ) + i\nM f0\na0\nb0 cos(pθ -\n) + ic0 cos(pθ +\n)\n\n+\nLfi\nf0\n\nZZ\nZ\n\n!\nZ ic0\n+\n(Labia0 + Labib0 + Laic) dic\nZ if0\n\n2π\n2π\n+\nM cos(pθ)ia0 + M cos(pθ -\n)ib0 + M cos(pθ +\n)ic0 + Lfif\ndif\nIf there is no variation of the stator inductances with rotor position θ, (which would be the\ncase if the rotor were perfectly round), the terms that involve La and L(ab) contribute zero so that\ntorque is given by:\n∂W 0\n2π\n2π\nTe =\nm = -pMif0 ia0 sin(pθ) + ib0 sin(pθ -\n) + ico sin(pθ +\n)\n∂θ\nWe will return to this type of machine in subsequent chapters.\n2.2\nContinuum Energy Flow\nAt this point, it is instructive to think of electromagnetic energy flow as described by Poynting's\nTheorem:\nS~ = E~\nH~\n×\nEnergy flow S~, called Poynting's Vector, describes electromagnetic power in terms of electric and\nmagnetic fields. It is power density: power per unit area, with units in the SI system of units of\nwatts per square meter.\nTo calculate electromagnetic power into some volume of space, we can integrate Poyting's Vector\nover the surface of that volume, and then using the divergence theorem:\nnda =\nSdv\nP = -\nS~ · ~\n-\nvol\nr · ~\nNow, the divergence of the Poynting Vector is, using a vector identity:\nr · S~\n=\nr · E~ × H~\n= H~ · r × E~ -E~ · r × H~\n∂B~\n=\n-H~ · ∂t -E~ · J~\nThe power crossing into a region of space is then:\nP =\nZ\nE~\nJ~ + H~\n∂B~\ndv\nvol\n·\n· ∂t\nNow, in the absence of material motion, interpretation of the two terms in this equation is fairly\nsimple. The first term describes dissipation:\nE~\nJ~ = E~ 2σ = J~ 2ρ\n·\n| |\n| |\n\nThe second term is interpreted as rate of change of magnetic stored energy. In the absence of\nhysteresis it is:\n∂Wm\n~\n∂B~\n= H\n∂t\n· ∂t\nNote that in the case of free space,\n∂B~\n∂H~\n∂\nH~ · ∂t = μ0H~ · ∂t = ∂t\n2μ0|H~ | 2\nwhich is straightforwardedly interpreted as rate of change of magnetic stored energy density:\nWm = 2μ0|H|\nSome materials exhibit hysteretic behavior, in which stored energy is not a single valued function\nof either B~ or H~ , and we will consider that case anon.\n2.3\nMaterial Motion\nIn the presence of material motion ~v, electric field E~ 0 in a \"moving\" frame is related to electric field\nE~ in a \"stationary\" frame and to magnetic field B~ by:\nE~ 0 = E~ + ~v\nB~\n×\nThis is an experimental result obtained by observing charged particles moving in combined electric\nand magnetic fields. It is a relatavistic expression, so that the qualifiers \"moving\" and \"stationary\"\nare themselves relative. The electric fields are what would be observed in either frame. In MQS\nsystems, the magnetic flux density B~ is the same in both frames.\nThe term relating to current density becomes:\nE~\nJ~ =\nE~ 0\nv\nB~\nJ~\n·\n-~ ×\n·\nWe can interpret E~ 0\nJ~ as dissipation, but the second term bears a little examination. Note\n·\nthat it is in the form of a vector triple (scalar) product:\n-~v × B~ · J~ = -~v · B~ × J~ = -~v · J~ × B~\nThis is in the form of velocity times force density and represents power conversion from electro\nmagnetic to mechanical form. This is consistent with the Lorentz force law (also experimentally\nobserved):\nF~ = J~\nB~\n×\nThis last expression is yet another way of describing energy conversion processes in electric\nmachinery, as the component of apparent electric field produced by material motion through a\nmagnetic field, when reacted against by a current, produces energy conversion to mechanical form\nrather than dissipation.\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\nr ×\nI\nZ\nZ I\nZ\n\n2.4\nAdditional Issues in Energy Methods\nThere are two more important and interesting issues to consider as we study the development\nof forces of electromagnetic origin and their calculation using energy methods.\nThese concern\nsituations which are not simply representable by lumped parameters and situations that involve\npermanent magnets.\n2.4.1\nCoenergy in Continuous Media\nConsider a system with not just a multiplicity of circuits but a continuum of current-carrying paths.\nIn that case we could identify the co-energy as:\nλ(~a)dJ~ · d~a\nW =\nm\narea\nwhere that area is chosen to cut all of the current carrying conductors. This area can be picked to\nbe perpedicular to each of the current filaments since the divergence of current is zero. The flux λ\nis calculated over a path that coincides with each current filament (such paths exist since current\nhas zero divergence). Then the flux is:\nλ(~a) =\nB~\nd~n\n·\nNow, if we use the vector potential A~ for which the magnetic flux density is:\nB~ =\nA~\nthe flux linked by any one of the current filaments is:\nλ(~a) =\nA~ d~`\n·\nwhere d~` is the path around the current filament. This implies directly that the coenergy is:\nA~ d`d\n~ J~\nW\nd~a\n=\n·\n·\nm\narea\nJ\nNow: it is possible to make d~` coincide with d~a and be parallel to the current filaments, so that:\nd ~\nA~\nJdv\nW =\n·\nm\nvol\n2.4.2\nPermanent Magnets\nPermanent magnets are becoming an even more important element in electric machine systems.\nOften systems with permanent magnets are approached in a relatively ad-hoc way, made equivalent\nto a current that produces the same MMF as the magnet itself.\nThe constitutive relationship for a permanent magnet relates the magnetic flux density B~ to\nmagnetic field H~ and the property of the magnet itself, the magnetization M~ .\nB~ = μ0 H~ + M~\n\nr ×\nZ\n\nr ×\nZZ\nZ\nNow, the effect of the magnetization is to act as if there were a current (called an amperian current)\nwith density:\nJ~∗ =\nM~\nNote that this amperian current \"acts\" just like ordinary current in making magnetic flux density.\nMagnetic co-energy is:\nW 0\nm =\nvol\nMdv\nA~ · r × d ~\nNext, note the vector identity\nr · C~ × D~\n= D~ · r × C~\n-C~ · r × D~\nSo that:\nZ\nZ\nd ~\nW 0 =\nvol\n-r · A~ × dM~\ndv +\nr × A~\n· Mdv\nm\nvol\nThen, noting that B~ =\nA~:\nW 0\nm = -\nA\nMd~s +\nB\nMdv\n\n~ × d ~\nvol\n~ · d ~\nm\nThe first of these integrals (closed surface) vanishes if it is taken over a surface just outside the\nmagnet, where M~ is zero. Thus the magnetic co-energy in a system with only a permanent magnet\nsource is\nZ\nW 0 =\nB~\nMdv\nd ~\nvol\n·\nAdding current carrying coils to such a system is done in the obvious way.\n2.5\nElectric Machine Description:\nActually, this description shows a conventional induction motor. This is a very common type of\nelectric machine and will serve as a reference point. Most other electric machines operate in a\nfashion which is the same as the induction machine or which differ in ways which are easy to\nreference to the induction machine.\nConsider the simplified machine drawing shown in Figure 3. Most (but not all!) machines we\nwill be studying have essentially this morphology. The rotor of the machine is mounted on a shaft\nwhich is supported on some sort of bearing(s). Usually, but not always, the rotor is inside. I have\ndrawn a rotor which is round, but this does not need to be the case. I have also indicated rotor\nconductors, but sometimes the rotor has permanent magnets either fastened to it or inside, and\nsometimes (as in Variable Reluctance Machines) it is just an oddly shaped piece of steel. The stator\nis, in this drawing, on the outside and has windings. With most of the machines we will be dealing\nwith, the stator winding is the armature, or electrical power input element. (In DC and Universal\nmotors this is reversed, with the armature contained on the rotor: we will deal with these later).\nIn most electrical machines the rotor and the stator are made of highly magnetically permeable\nmaterials: steel or magnetic iron. In many common machines such as induction motors the rotor\nand stator are both made up of thin sheets of silicon steel. Punched into those sheets are slots\nwhich contain the rotor and stator conductors.\n\nStator\nStator\nConductors\nRotor\nRotor\nConductors\nBearings\nShaft\nEnd Windings\nAir\nGap\nFigure 3: Form of Electric Machine\nFigure 4 is a picture of part of an induction machine distorted so that the air-gap is straightened\nout (as if the machine had infinite radius). This is actually a convenient way of drawing the machine\nand, we will find, leads to useful methods of analysis.\nWhat is important to note for now is that the machine has an air gap g which is relatively\nsmall (that is, the gap dimension is much less than the machine radius r). The machine also has a\nphysical length l. The electric machine works by producing a shear stress in the air-gap (with of\ncourse side effects such as production of \"back voltage\"). It is possible to define the average air-\ngap shear stress, which we will refer to as τ. Total developed torque is force over the surface area\ntimes moment (which is rotor radius):\nT = 2πr2` < τ >\nPower transferred by this device is just torque times speed, which is the same as force times\nsurface velocity, since surface velocity is u = rΩ:\nPm = ΩT = 2πr` < τ > u\nIf we note that active rotor volume is πr2`, the ratio of torque to volume is just:\nT = 2 < τ >\nVr\nNow, determining what can be done in a volume of machine involves two things. First, it is\nclear that the volume we have calculated here is not the whole machine volume, since it does not\ninclude the stator. The actual estimate of total machine volume from the rotor volume is actually\nquite complex and detailed and we will leave that one for later. Second, we need to estimate the\nvalue of the useful average shear stress. Suppose both the radial flux density Br and the stator\nsurface current density Kz are sinusoidal flux waves of the form:\nBr =\n√\n2B0 cos (pθ -ωt)\n\nStator Core\nStator Conductors\nIn Slots\nRotor Conductors\nIn Slots\nAir Gap\nFigure 4: Windings in Slots\nKz =\n√\n2K0 cos (pθ -ωt)\nNote that this assumes these two quantities are exactly in phase, or oriented to ideally produce\ntorque, so we are going to get an \"optimistic\" bound here.\nThen the average value of surface\ntraction is:\n1 Z 2π\n< τ >=\nBrKzdθ = B0K0\n2π 0\nThis actually makes some sense in view of the empirically derived Lorentz Force Law: Given a\n(vector) current density and a (vector) flux density. In the absence of magnetic materials (those\nwith permeability different from that of free space), the observed force on a conductor is:\nF~ = J~\nB~\n×\nWhere J~ is the vector describing current density (A/m2) and B~ is the magnetic flux density\n(T). This is actually enough to describe the forces we see in many machines, but since electric\nmachines have permeable magnetic material and since magnetic fields produce forces on permeable\nmaterial even in the absence of macroscopic currents it is necessary to observe how force appears\non such material. A suitable empirical expression for force density is:\nF~ = J~ × B~ - 1\nH~ · H~\nrμ\nwhere H~ is the magnetic field intensity and μ is the permeability.\nNow, note that current density is the curl of magnetic field intensity, so that:\nF~\n=\nr × H~\n× μH~ -2\nH~ · H~\nrμ\n\n=\nμ r × H~\n× H~ -2\nH~ · H~\nrμ\nAnd, since:\nH~\nH~\nr × H~\n× H~ =\nH~ · r H~ -2\n1 r\n·\n\nFk =\nμHiHk -\nδik\nX\nH2\n∂x\nn\ni\nn\nthe Kroneker delta δ\n= 1 if i = k, 0 otherwise.\n\n!\n\n!\nZ\nZ\nZZ\n\nP\nI\nI X\nforce density is:\n\nF~\n=\nμ H~ · r H~ -2μr H~ · H~\n-2\nH~ · H~\nrμ\n\n=\nμ H~ · r H~ -r\nμ H~ · H~\nThis expression can be written by components: the component of force in the i'th dimension is:\nX\n∂\n∂\nX\nFi = μ\nHk ∂xk\nHi -∂xi\n2μ\nHk\nk\nk\nNow, see that we can write the divergence of magnetic flux density as:\nB~ =\nX ∂ μHk = 0\nr ·\nk ∂xk\nand\nX\n∂\nX ∂\nX ∂\nμ\nHk ∂xk\nHi =\n∂xk\nμHkHi -Hi\n∂xk\nμHk\nk\nk\nk\nbut since the last term in that is zero, we can write force density as:\n∂\nμ\n\nwhere we have used\nik\nNote that this force density is in the form of the divergence of a tensor:\n∂\nFk =\nTik\n∂xi\nor\nF~ =\nT\nr ·\nIn this case, force on some object that can be surrounded by a closed surface can be found by\nusing the divergence theorem:\nf~ =\n~\nTdv =\nT ~nda\n·\nvol\nFdv =\nvol\nr ·\nor, if we note surface traction to be τi =\nk Tiknk , where n is the surface normal vector, then the\ntotal force in direction i is just:\nf~ =\nτida =\nTiknkda\ns\nk\nThe interpretation of all of this is less difficult than the notation suggests. This field description\nof forces gives us a simple picture of surface traction, the force per unit area on a surface. If we just\nintegrate this traction over the area of some body we get the whole force on the body. Note that\n\nP\nn\no\nn\no\nn\no\nn\no\nthis works if we integrate the traction over a surface that is itself in free space but which surrounds\nthe body (because we can impose no force on free space).\nNote one more thing about this notation. Sometimes when subscripts are repeated as they are\nhere the summation symbol is omitted. Thus we would write τi =\nk Tiknk = Tiknk.\nNow, if we go back to the case of a circular cylinder and are interested in torque, it is pretty\nclear that we can compute the circumferential force by noting that the normal vector to the cylinder\nis just the radial unit vector, and then the circumferential traction must simply be:\nτθ = μ0HrHθ\nSimply integrating this over the surface gives azimuthal force, and then multiplying by radius\n(moment arm) gives torque. The last step is to note that, if the rotor is made of highly permeable\nmaterial, the azimuthal magnetic field is equal to surface current density.\nTying the MST and Poynting Approaches Together\ny\nx\nField Region\nContour\nFigure 5: Illustrative Region of Space\nNow that the stage is set, consider energy flow and force transfer in a narrow region of space as\nillustrated by Figure 5. The upper and lower surfaces may support currents. Assume that all of the\nfields, electric and magnetic, are of the form of a traveling wave in the x- direction: Re ej(ωt-kx) .\nIf we assume that form for the fields and also assume that there is no variation in the z- direction\n(equivalently, the problem is infinitely long in the z- direction), there can be no x- directed currents\nbecause the divergence of current is zero: r\nJ~ = 0. In a magnetostatic system this is true of\n·\nelectric field E~ too. Thus we will assume that current is confined to the z- direction and to the two\nsurfaces illustrated in Figure 5, and thus the only important fields are:\nE~\n= ~izRe Ezej(ωt-kx)\nH~\n= ~ixRe Hxej(ωt-kx)\n+ ~iyRe Hyej(ωt-kx)\nWe may use Faraday's Law (r × E~ = -∂B~ ) to establish the relationship between the electric\n∂t\nand magnetic field: the y- component of Faraday's Law is:\njkE = -jωμ0H\nz\ny\nor\nω\nE =\nz\n-k μ0Hy\n\nn\no\nn\no\nn\no\nThe phase velocity uph = ω\nk is a most important quantity. Note that, if one of the surfaces is\nmoving (as it would be in, say, an induction machine), the frequency and hence the apparent phase\nvelocity, will be shifted by the motion. We will use this fact shortly.\nEnergy flow through the surface denoted by the dotted line in Figure 5 is the component of\nPoynting's Vector in the negative y- direction. The relevant component is:\nSy =\n\nE~ × H~\n\ny = EzHx = - ω\nk μ0HyHx\nNote that this expression contains the xy component of the Maxwell Stress Tensor Txy =\nμ0HxHy so that power flow downward through the surface is:\nω\nS = -Sy =\nμ0HxHy = uphTxy\nk\nThe average power flow is the same, in this case, for time and for space, and is:\nμ0\n< S >=\nRe {E H∗\nx} = uph\nRe HyHx\n∗\nz\nWe may choose to define a surface impedance:\nE\nZ =\nz\ns\n-Hx\nwhich becomes:\nH\nZs = -μ0uph\ny = -μ0uphR\nHx\nwhere now we have defined the parameter R to be the ratio between y- and x- directed complex\nfield amplitudes.

Consider the\ngeometry described in Figure 6. Shown here is only the relative motion gap region. This is bounded\nby two regions of highly permeable material (e.g. iron), comprising the stator and shuttle. On the\nsurface of the stator (the upper region) is a surface current:\nK~ s = ~izRe Kzsej(ωt-kx)\n\nn\no\nThe shuttle is, in this case, moving in the positive x- direction at some velocity u. It may also be\ndescribed as an infinitely permeable region with the capability of supporting a surface current with\nsurface conductivity σs, so that Kzr = σsEz.\nNote that Ampere's Law gives us a boundary condition on magnetic field just below the upper\nsurface of this problem: Hx = Kzs, so that, if we can establish the ratio between y- and x- directed\nfields at that location,\n< Txy >= μ0\nyHx\n∗\nμ\n0 |Kzs| 2Re {R}\nRe H\n=\nNote that the ratio of fields Hy/Hx = R is independent of reference frame (it doesn't matter\nif we are looking at the fields from the shuttle or the stator), so that the shear stress described by\nTxy is also frame independent. Now, if the shuttle (lower surface) is moving relative to the upper\nsurface, the velocity of the traveling wave relative to the shuttle is:\nω\nus = uph -u = s k\nwhere we have now defined the dimensionless slip s to be the ratio between frequency seen by the\nshuttle to frequency seen by the stator. We may use this to describe energy flow as described by\nPoynting's Theorem. Energy flow in the stator frame is:\nSupper = uphTxy\nIn the frame of the shuttle, however, it is\nSlower = usTxy = sSupper\nNow, the interpretation of this is that energy flow out of the upper surface (Supper) consists of\nenergy converted (mechanical power) plus energy dissipated in the shuttle (which is Slower here.\nThe difference between these two power flows, calculated using Poynting's Theorem, is power\nconverted from electrical to mechanical form:\nSconverted = Supper(1 -s)\nNow, to finish the problem, note that surface current in the shuttle is:\nK\n= E0 σs = -usμ0σsH\nzr\nz\ny\nwhere the electric field E0 is measured in the frame of the shuttle.\nz\nWe assume here that the magnetic gap g is small enough that we may assume kg 1.

Two problems are considered here. The first considers a layer of linear\nmaterial backed up by an infinitely permeable surface. This is approximately the situation presented\nby, for example, surface mounted permanent magnets and is probably a decent approximation to\nthe conduction mechanism that would be responsible for loss due to asynchronous harmonics in\nthese machines. It is also appropriate for use in estimating losses in solid rotor induction machines\nand in the poles of turbogenerators. The second problem, which we do not work here but simply\npresent the previously worked solution, concerns saturating ferromagnetic material.\n5.1\nLinear Case\nThe situation and coordinate system are shown in Figure 7. The conductive layer is of thicknes T\nand has conductivity σ and permeability μ0. To keep the mathematical expressions within bounds,\nwe assume rectilinear geometry. This assumption will present errors which are small to the extent\nthat curvature of the problem is small compared with the wavenumbers encountered. We presume\nthat the situation is excited, as it would be in an electric machine, by a current sheet of the form\nKz = Re Kej(ωt-kx)\nH x\nPermeable Surface\nConductive Slab\ny\nx\nFigure 7: Axial View of Magnetic Field Problem\nIn the conducting material, we must satisfy the diffusion equation:\n=\nr2H\nμ0σ∂\n∂t\nH\n\nwhere the skin depth is:\n\ns\nδ =\nωμ0σ\nTo obtain surface impedance, we use Faraday's law:\n∂B\nr × E = -∂t\nwhich gives:\nω\nEz = -μ0 H\nk\ny\nNow: the \"surface current\" is just\nKs = -Hx\nso that the equivalent surface impedance is:\nE\nω\nZ =\nz\n= jμ0\ncoth αT\n-Hx\nα\nIn view of the boundary condition at the back surface of the material, taking that point to be\ny = 0, a general solution for the magnetic field in the material is:\nn\no\nHx\n=\nRe A sinh αyej(ωt-kx)\nk\n\nHy\n=\nRe j A cosh αyej(ωt-kx)\nα\nwhere the coefficient α satisfies:\nα2 = jωμ0σ + k2\nand note that the coefficients above are chosen so that H has no divergence.\nNote that if k is small (that is, if the wavelength of the excitation is large), this spatial coefficient\nα becomes\n1 + j\nα =\nδ\nA pair of limits are interesting here. Assuming that the wavelength is long so that k is negligible,\nthen if αT is small (i.e. thin material),\nω\nZ\njμ0\n=\n→\nα2T\nσT\nOn the other hand as αT →inf,\n1 + j\nZ →\nσδ\nNext it is necessary to transfer this surface impedance across the air-gap of a machine. So, with\nreference to Figure 8, assume a new coordinate system in which the surface of impedance Zs is\nlocated at y = 0, and we wish to determine the impedance Z = -Ez/Hx at y = g.\nIn the gap there is no current, so magnetic field can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar\npotential which obeys Laplace's equation:\nH = -rψ\n\nand\nr 2ψ = 0\nIgnoring a common factor of ej(ωt-kx), we can express H in the gap as:\n\nH\n=\n\n-ky\nx\njk ψ eky + ψ\n\n+\n\n- e\n\nH\n=\n-k\n\nψ eky\n\n-\n-ky\n\ny\nψ\n+\n- e\n\nAt the surface of the rotor,\nEz = -HxZs\nor\n\n-ωμ0 ψ + -ψ -\n= jkZs ψ + ψ\n+\n-\nand then, at the surface of the stator\n\n,\n\nψ ekg\nEz\nω\nψ e-kg\n-\n+\nZ =\n= jμ\n-\n-\nH\nk ψ ekg + ψ e-kg\nx\n+\n-\n(\n)\nKz\ny\nx\ng\nSurface Impedance Z s\nFigure 8: Impedance across the air-gap\nA bit of manipulation is required to obtain:\nω\nekg (ωμ0 -jkZs) -e-kg (ωμ0 + jkZs)\nZ = jμ0 k\nekg (ωμ0 -jkZ ) + e-kg (ωμ0 + jkZ )\ns\ns\nIt is useful to note that, in the limit of Zs →inf, this expression approaches the gap impedance\nωμ0\nZg = j k2g\nand, if the gap is small enough that kg\n0,\n→\nZ →Zg||Zs\n\nIron\nElectric machines employ ferromagnetic materials to carry magnetic flux from and to appropriate\nplaces within the machine. Such materials have properties which are interesting, useful and prob\nlematical, and the designers of electric machines must deal with this stuff. The purpose of this\nnote is to introduce the most salient properties of the kinds of magnetic materials used in electric\nmachines.\nWe will be concerned here with materials which exhibit magnetization: flux density is something\nother than B~ = μ0H~ . Generally, we will speak of hard and soft magnetic materials. Hard materials\nare those in which the magnetization tends to be permanent, while soft materials are used in\nmagnetic circuits of electric machines and transformers. Since they are related we will find ourselves\ntalking about them either at the same time or in close proximity, even though their uses are widely\ndisparite.\n6.1\nMagnetization:\nIt is possible to relate, in all materials, magnetic flux density to magnetic field intensity with a\nconsitutive relationship of the form:\nB~ = μ0 H~ + M~\nwhere magnetic field intensity H and magnetization M are the two important properties. Now,\nin linear magnetic material magnetization is a simple linear function of magnetic field:\nM~ = χmH~\nso that the flux density is also a linear function:\nB~ = μ0 (1 + χm) H~\nNote that in the most general case the magnetic susceptibility cm might be a tensor, leading\nto flux density being non-colinear with magnetic field intensity. But such a relationship would still\nbe linear. Generally this sort of complexity does not have a major effect on electric machines.\n6.2\nSaturation and Hysteresis\nIn useful magnetic materials this nice relationship is not correct and we need to take a more general\nview. We will not deal with the microscopic picture here, except to note that the magnetization is\ndue to the alignment of groups of magnetic dipoles, the groups often called domaines. There are\nonly so many magnetic dipoles available in any given material, so that once the flux density is high\nenough the material is said to saturate, and the relationship between magnetic flux density and\nmagnetic field intensity is nonlinear.\nShown in Figure 9, for example, is a \"saturation curve\" for a magnetic sheet steel that is\nsometimes used in electric machinery. Note the magnetic field intensity is on a logarithmic scale.\nIf this were plotted on linear coordinates the saturation would appear to be quite abrupt.\nAt this point it is appropriate to note that the units used in magnetic field analysis are not\nalways the same nor even consistent. In almost all systems the unit of flux is the weber (W), which\n\nFigure 9: Saturation Curve: Commercial M-19 Silicon Iron\nis the same as a volt-second. In SI the unit of flux density is the tesla (T), but many people refer to\nthe gauss (G), which has its origin in CGS. 10,000 G = 1 T. Now it gets worse, because there is an\nEnglish system measure of flux density generally called kilo-lines per square inch. This is because\nin the English system the unit of flux is the line. 108 lines is equal to a weber. Thus a Tesla is 64.5\nkilolines per square inch.\nThe SI and CGS units of flux density are easy to reconcile, but the units of magnetic field\nare a bit harder. In SI we generally measure H in amperes/meter (or ampere-turns per meter).\nOften, however, you will see magnetic field represented as Oersteds (Oe). One Oe is the same as\nthe magnetic field required to produce one gauss in free space. So 79.577 A/m is one Oe.\nIn most useful magnetic materials the magnetic domaines tend to be somewhat \"sticky\", and a\nmore-than-incremental magnetic field is required to get them to move. This leads to the property\ncalled \"hysteresis\", both useful and problematical in many magnetic systems.\nHysteresis loops take many forms; a generalized picture of one is shown in Figure 10. Salient\nfeatures of the hysteresis curve are the remanent magnetization Br and the coercive field Hc. Note\nthat the actual loop that will be traced out is a function of field amplitude and history. Thus there\nare many other \"minor loops\" that might be traced out by the B-H characteristic of a piece of\nmaterial, depending on just what the fields and fluxes have done and are doing.\nNow, hysteresis is important for two reasons. First, it represents the mechanism for \"trapping\"\nmagnetic flux in a piece of material to form a permanent magnet. We will have more to say about\nthat anon. Second, hysteresis is a loss mechanism. To show this, consider some arbitrary chunk of\nCourtesy of United States Steel Corporation. (U.S. Steel).

At\nthe other end of the spectrum are \"hard\" magnetic materials which are used to make permanent\nmagnets. The terminology comes from steel, in which soft, annealed steel material tends to have\nnarrow loops and hardened steel tends to have wider loops. However permanent magnet technology\nhas advanced to the point where the coercive forces possible in even cheap ceramic magnets far\nexceed those of the hardest steels.\n\n~\nn\no\n6.3\nConduction, Eddy Currents and Laminations:\nSteel, being a metal, is an electrical conductor.\nThus when time varying magnetic fields pass\nthrough it they cause eddy currents to flow, and of course those produce dissipation. In fact, for\nalmost all applications involving \"soft\" iron, eddy currents are the dominant source of loss. To\nreduce the eddy current loss, magnetic circuits of transformers and electric machines are almost\ninvariably laminated, or made up of relatively thin sheets of steel. To further reduce losses the steel\nis alloyed with elements (often silicon) which poison the electrical conductivity.\nThere are several approaches to estimating the loss due to eddy currents in steel sheets and in\nthe surface of solid iron, and it is worthwhile to look at a few of them. It should be noted that this\nis a \"hard\" problem, since the behavior of the material itself is difficult to characterize.\n6.4\nComplete Penetration Case\nt\ny\nx\nz\nFigure 11: Lamination Section for Loss Calculation\nConsider the problem of a stack of laminations. In particular, consider one sheet in the stack\nrepresented in Figure 11. It has thickness t and conductivity σ. Assume that the \"skin depth\"\nis much greater than the sheet thickness so that magnetic field penetrates the sheet completely.\nFurther, assume that the applied magnetic flux density is parallel to the surface of the sheets:\njωt\nB = ~izRe\n√\n2B0e\nNow we can use Faraday's law to determine the electric field and therefore current density in\nthe sheet. If the problem is uniform in the x- and z- directions,\n∂Ex\n∂y = -jω0B0\nNote also that, unless there is some net transport current in the x- direction, E must be anti\nsymmetric about the center of the sheet. Thus if we take the origin of y to be in the center, electric\nfield and current are:\nE\n=\n-jωB0y\nx\nJ\n=\n-jωB0σy\nx\nLocal power dissipated is\nP (y) = ω2B0\n2σy2 = |J|2\nσ\n\nTo find average power dissipated we integrate over the thickness of the lamination:\nZ t\nZ t\n1 ω2B0\n2t2σ\n< P >=\nP (y)dy =\nω2B0\n2σ\ny 2dy =\nt\nt\nPay attention to the orders of the various terms here: power is proportional to the square of\nflux density and to the square of frequency. It is also proportional to the square of the lamination\nthickness (this is average volume power dissipation).\nAs an aside, consider a simple magnetic circuit made of this material, with some length ` and\narea A, so that volume of material is `A. Flux lined by a coil of N turns would be:\nΛ = NΦ = NAB0\nand voltage is of course just V = jwL. Total power dissipated in this core would be:\nV 2\nω2B0\n2t2σ =\nPc = A` 12\nRc\nwhere the equivalent core resistance is now\nA 12N 2\nRc = ` σt2\n6.5\nEddy Currents in Saturating Iron\nThe same geometry holds for this pattern, although we consider only the one-dimensional problem\n(k\n0). The problem was worked by McLean and his graduate student Agarwal [2] [1]. They\n→\nassumed that the magnetic field at the surface of the flat slab of material was sinusoidal in time\nand of high enough amplitude to saturate the material.\nThis is true if the material has high\npermeability and the magnetic field is strong. What happens is that the impressed magnetic field\nsaturates a region of material near the surface, leading to a magnetic flux density parallel to the\nsurface. The depth of the region affected changes with time, and there is a separating surface (in\nthe flat problem this is a plane) that moves away from the top surface in response to the change\nin the magnetic field. An electric field is developed to move the surface, and that magnetic field\ndrives eddy currents in the material.\nH\nB\nB 0\nFigure 12: Idealized Saturating Characteristic\n\nZ\nAssume that the material has a perfectly rectangular magnetization curve as shown in Figure 12,\nso that flux density in the x- direction is:\nBx = B0sign(Hx)\nThe flux per unit width (in the z- direction) is:\n-inf\nΦ =\nBxdy\nand Faraday's law becomes:\n∂Φ\nEz = ∂t\nwhile Ampere's law in conjunction with Ohm's law is:\n∂Hx = σEz\n∂y\nNow, McLean suggested a solution to this set in which there is a \"separating surface\" at depth ζ\nbelow the surface, as shown in Figure 13 . At any given time:\nHx\nJz\n=\n=\nHs(t)\n\n1 + y\nζ\n\nσEz = Hs\nζ\ny\nB\nB s\ns\nx\nSeparating Surface\nPenetration\nDepth\nFigure 13: Separating Surface and Penetration Depth\nThat is, in the region between the separating surface and the top of the material, electric field\nEz is uniform and magnetic field Hx is a linear function of depth, falling from its impressed value at\nthe surface to zero at the separating surface. Now: electric field is produced by the rate of change\nof flux which is:\n∂Φ\n∂ζ\nEz =\n= 2Bx\n∂t\n∂t\nEliminating E, we have:\n∂ζ\nHs\n2ζ\n=\n∂t\nσBx\n\ns\nand then, if the impressed magnetic field is sinusoidal, this becomes:\ndζ2\nH0\ndt =\nsin ωt\nσB0\n|\n|\nThis is easy to solve, assuming that ζ = 0 at t = 0,\ns\n2H0\nωt\nζ\nsin\n=\nωσB0\nNow: the surface always moves in the downward direction (as we have drawn it), so at each half\ncycle a new surface is created: the old one just stops moving at a maximum position, or penetration\ndepth:\n2H0\nδ =\nωσB0\nThis penetration depth is analogous to the \"skin depth\" of the linear theory. However, it is an\nabsolute penetration depth.\nThe resulting electric field is:\n2H0\nωt\nEz =\ncos\n0 < ωt < π\nσδ\nThis may be Fourier analyzed: noting that if the impressed magnetic field is sinusoidal, only the\ntime fundamental component of electric field is important, leading to:\n8 H0\nEz =\n(cos ωt + 2 sin ωt + . . .)\n3π σδ\nComplex surface impedance is the ratio between the complex amplitude of electric and magnetic\nfield, which becomes:\nE\nZ =\nz =\n(2 + j)\ns\nH\n3π σδ\nx\nThus, in practical applications, we can handle this surface much as we handle linear conductive\nsurfaces, by establishing a skin depth and assuming that current flows within that skin depth of\nthe surface. The resistance is modified by the factor of 3\nπ and the \"power factor\" of this surface is\nabout 89 % (as opposed to a linear surface where the \"power factor\" is about 71 %.\nAgarwal suggests using a value for B0 of about 75 % of the saturation flux density of the steel.\nSemi-Empirical Method of Handling Iron Loss\nNeither of the models described so far are fully satisfactory in describing the behavior of laminated\niron, because losses are a combination of eddy current and hysteresis losses. The rather simple\nmodel employed for eddy currents is precise because of its assumption of abrupt saturation. The\nhysteresis model, while precise, would require an empirical determination of the size of the hysteresis\nloops anyway. So we must often resort to empirical loss data. Manufacturers of lamination steel\nsheets will publish data, usually in the form of curves, for many of their products. Here are a few\nways of looking at the data.\n\nA low frequency flux density vs. magnetic field (\"saturation\") curve was shown in Figure 9.\nIncluded with that was a measure of the incremental permeability\ndB\nμ = dH\nIn some machine applications either the \"total\" inductance (ratio of flux to MMF) or \"incremental\"\ninductance (slope of the flux to MMF curve) is required. In the limit of low frequency these numbers\nmay be useful.\nFor designing electric machines, however, a second way of looking at steel may be more useful.\nThis is to measure the real and reactive power as a function of magnetic flux density and (sometimes)\nfrequency. In principal, this data is immediately useful. In any well-designed electric machine the\nflux density in the core is distributed fairly uniformly and is not strongly affected by eddy currents,\netc. in the core. Under such circumstances one can determine the flux density in each part of the\ncore. With that information one can go to the published empirical data for real and reactive power\nand determine core loss and reactive power requirements.\nFigure 14: Real and Apparent Loss: M19, Fully Processed, 29 Ga\nFigure 14 shows core loss and \"apparent\" power per unit mass as a function of (RMS) induction\nfor 29 gage, fully processed M-19 steel. The two left-hand curves are the ones we will find most\nuseful. \"P \" denotes real power while \"Pa \" denotes \"apparent power\". The use of this data is quite\nstraightforward.

But\nit will be approximately true for small excursions in either voltage or frequency and therefore\nuseful for estimating voltage drop due to exciting current and such matters. In design program\napplications these parameters can be re-calculated repeatedly if necessary.\n\"Looking up\" this data is a it awkward for design studies, so it is often convenient to do a\n\"curve fit\" to the published data.

It appears, however, that the simple\nexponential fit which works well for real power is inadequate, at least if relatively high inductions\nare to be used.

These programs use MATLAB's fmins routine to\nminimize a mean-squared error as calculated by the auxiliary function fiterr.m.\n2. e2fit.m implements the double exponential fit of apparent power against flux density. Use\nis just like efit. It uses the auxiliary function fit2err.m.\n3. pfit.m uses the MATLAB function polyfit to fit a polynomial (in B) to the data.\nMost of the machine design scripts enclosed with the material for this special summer subject\nemploy the exponential fits for core iron developed here.\nReferences\n[1] W.
