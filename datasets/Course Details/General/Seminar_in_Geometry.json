  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nFormat and Description\n\nIn this course, students take turns in giving lectures. For the most part, the lectures are based on Robert Osserman's classic book\nA Survey of Minimal Surfaces\n, and Michael Spivak's\nCalculus on Manifolds\n, Manfredo Do Carmo's\nCurves and Surfaces\n. Lars Ahlfors'\nComplex Analysis\nwill also be referred to at various points. Note that Do Carmo treats only surfaces in\nR\n; many things are easy to generalise; some things do not generalise or it is difficult to see how they do. Spivak refers to '\nCalculus on Manifolds\n'; Spivak 3 and 4 refer to volumes of his '\nDifferential Geometry\n' series.\n\nTextbooks\n\nOsserman, Robert.\nA Survey of Minimal Surfaces.\nDover Phoenix Editions. New York: Dover Publications, May 1, 2002. ISBN: 0486495140.\n\nSpivak, Michael.\nCalculus on Manifolds: A Modern Approach to Classical Theorems of Advanced Calculus.\nNew York: Westview Press, June 1, 1965.

Osserman's book has a long list of references, which he refers to throughout the text.\n\nRecommended Reading About Reading\n\nFor general information about reading mathematics, students should consult the article \"\nHow to Read Mathematics\n\" by Shai Simonson and Fernando Gouveau. It is published on the web, and talks about the language of mathematics, and how best to approach it.\n\nHomework\n\nHomework assignments are handed out each Wednesday, and are due the following Wednesday. The lowest homework grade can be dropped. No late homework is accepted.\n\nStudents may work together on homework assignments, in fact they are encouraged to do so. However, they must write up their homework assignment by themselves.",

      "content": "Homework 6, 18.994. Due Wed Nov 3rd\nThis homework set will be combined with homework five (weighted according\nto the total number points available on each) to be worth two homework sets\nbetween them.\n1. Suppose a nonparametric minimal surface in R3 is given by\nx(u1, u2) = (u1, u2, g(u1) + h(u2)).\nShow that either the surface is part of a plane, or there is an a 6= 0 such\nthat\ng(u1) = -\nlog cos(au1), h(u2) =\nlog cos(au2),\na\na\nso that\ncos av\ng(u1) + h(u2) =\nlog\na\ncos au\nand x defines a Scherk's surface. Thus we see that there is quite a natural\nway of finding Scherk's surface.(4 points)\n2. Given a harmonic function u(x, y), one can use the Cauchy-Riemann equa-\ntions to find a conjugate harmonic function v(x, y) (i.e., a function so that\nf = u + iv is analytic in z = x + iy), but this involves integration and can\nbe difficult or impossible to carry out in practice. Ahlfors p 27 explains\nthat by using the formal substitution\nf(z) = 2u(z/2, z/2i) - u(0, 0),\none can find a conjugate harmonic function without having to perform\nintegration. Thus if we have a minimal surface given in isothermal coordi-\nnates, we can use Ahlfors' formula to find another minimal surface given\nin isothermal coordinates, and do Carmo 3.5 exercise 14 to find a whole\nfamily of such minimal surfaces. Use Ahlfors formula to begin with the\ncatenoid and \"discover\" the helicoid. (4 points)"

      "content": "In this course, we will each take turns in giving lectures. Below are some guidelines for\npreparing and presenting lectures.\nPreparing Lectures\nExplore, Don't Merely Comprehend\nAn important step in understanding mathematics is to find your own way of thinking\nabout it. Reading and comprehending the text is a necessary first step but you will truly\nunderstand the material when your approach to it does not slavishly follow someone\nelse's. Try putting the book away, and asking yourself some basic question about what\nyou've just read - it is by working with the mathematics that you come to own it. Check\nout the exercises; they often have good ideas to explore.\nWork Out Examples\n'Playing' with examples is the most effective way of making abstract notions concrete.\nSome textbooks don't emphasise examples in their text, or mention them but don't\nanalyse them fully. Don't be fooled by this; examples are crucially important. The reason\nthey may not be fully explained is that the best approach is to work them out for yourself:\nyou will learn much more that way than by reading someone else's explanation.\nStructure Your Presentation\nSo now you've read the text, and maybe a few other sources as well, and you've worked\nout as many examples as you can think of. It's time to take stock of the big picture. What\nis the main point of what you've learnt? Try to state the big picture in one or two\nsentences. Then break your new knowledge down into several main points, put in an\norder so that at each stage you have already developed whatever tools are needed. Then\nbreak each of these points down further, to about the level of detail where you are listing\nthe statements of your lemmata. Decide what examples you will use, and what role they\nwill play: will they illustrate theory you've just explained, or motivate a definition or\ntheorem? Don't simply follow the book - after coming to understand the material yourself\nyou may conclude that your way of presenting it is exactly what Osserman has chosen,\nand that is fine (he has very good taste, after all!) but that is a conclusion you should\nreach on your own, after understanding things in your own way.\nChoose Your Medium\nYou can use the blackboard, slides, a Microsoft(r) PowerPoint(r)-type presentation, or\nsome combination (you might want, for instance, to give a blackboard talk but\nincorporate pictures you've downloaded from a website). Blackboard presentations are\nmore common in mathematics than in many other disciplines, and are by far the most\ncommon choice for undergraduate and graduate math lectures, although seminar talks\nincreasingly use other media. In a mathematics lecture it is very important that the\nlecturer and the audience are both thinking through the material as it is presented; the\n\nlecturer needs to not be simply reading from lecture notes/slides, but recreating them, at\nthe right pace for the audience. The blackboard forces this upon you more than the other\nmedia do, because you are writing the material rather than reading it. I feel that it is easier\nto give a 'bad' slide/Microsoft(r) PowerPoint(r) lecture than a 'bad' blackboard one as one\ncan succumb to the temptation of trying to present more than the audience can absorb, or\nof simply reading one's slides. However, I feel it's about as difficult to give a great talk in\nany of these media, and in a seminar situation where you probably want to present results\nwithout giving all the details about them, the slide/Microsoft(r) PowerPoint(r)\npresentations come in to their own. Also, in either a lecture or a seminar talk, doing a\nMicrosoft(r) PowerPoint(r) presentation allows you to seamlessly incorporate things like\nvideos or interactive Java(r) applets that can be wonderful additions to your presentation.\nBlackboard Talk: Make Detailed Lecture Notes\nNow it's time to expand your outline out into a lecture. What it's appropriate to write on\nthe board is different from what you would write if you were writing a textbook. Be\nsuccinct. Avoid long sentences. You should write out lecture notes that consist of what\nyou intend to write on the board. Some people say that you should write out notes exactly\nas you plan to present the material; the same number of lines as you'll put on each board\netc (and work out how many lines should go on each board before the class). You may\nfeel that this is taking things too far, but it is important to at least produce notes that\naccurately represent what you will do in the lecture. It's also helpful to make a note of\nany additional comments that you plan to make, but anything important (for instance\nanything that made it on to your outline) should be written down on the board. You may\nwant to expand on some side issue without writing down the details, or mention that\nsomething you've just introduced will be used again later, but in general at least a\nsummary of what you're saying should make it on to the board.\nSlides/Microsoft(r) PowerPoint(r) Presentation\nMake sure that your font sizes are large enough that the audience will easily be able to\nread your text (this is especially important if you're in a large lecture hall), and don't\ncrowd each page - use double spacing, and an attractive, uncramped layout. Colours are\ngreat, too.\nDo a Timed Practice\nDo a 'dry run' on the medium you plan to use, and time it. If there's someone else who's\ninterested in listening, that's great but it's not necessary. Time yourself, and take note not\nonly of the total time but of the time it takes you to get to a few different points in your\nlecture, so that on the day you'll know whether you are running a bit fast or a bit slow.\nPlan how you can adjust in each case; something extra you can say or something you can\nsay more succinctly or cut out altogether.\n\nGiving Lectures\nBlackboard Talk\nSummarise\nIt's often a good idea to give your audience a quick summary of what you are going to\nsay, so that they know what to expect and they recognise the main points immediately.\nGive it Live\nYou don't want your lecture to consist of you copying your notes on to the board, and\nfaithfully reading them to us. You should be able to remember large parts of your lecture;\nyou will want your notes close by and you'll probably glance at them often to make sure\nyou're giving the lecture as planned, but make sure that you are actively understanding\nand explaining the material as you present it. When you come to a proof or example this\nis particularly important or you'll get lost.\nUse the Boards in Order\nStart by erasing anything that the previous class left on the board. Begin writing on the\nleft with one of the movable boards, then push it up and write on the bottom left board,\nand work your way rightwards, always making sure that you first write on a board that\ncan be pushed up. For wide boards you may want to draw a line down the middle to\ndivide it into smaller pieces.\nMake Your Writing Legible\nNeat writing, at a size that is easy to read (but not so big you can't fit much on the board)\nis one of those things one comes to appreciate when it's missing. Don't try to cram\nsomething in to a tiny piece of the board: begin a new one, if you need to. These last two\npoints are easy to do, and they make a big difference.\nRepeat, Repeat, Repeat\nYou know what it is like to be in a lecture - no matter how interesting the lecture is, you'll\nspace out for a few seconds occasionally. As a lecturer, you need to make sure that a few\nmoments of inattention don't make it impossible for someone to follow what you say\nnext. This is one of the reasons for writing down some account of pretty much everything\nyou say. You should also talk about what you're writing, and since it's quicker to speak\nthan to write you have time to emphasise the main point of each paragraph by repeating\nit. This tells people that it is important and gives them another chance to understand your\npoint, especially if you can say it in a slightly different way.\n\nLook at the Audience\nTry not to talk to the blackboard; you'll need to face it whilst writing but turn around as\nmuch as possible, and spend some time not writing anything so that you can engage with\nthe audience. Try to make eye contact with each person in the room at some point during\nyour lecture; don't just direct your remarks to the person who asked an interesting\nquestion at the beginning of class.\nEncourage Class Participation\nA lively class in which people are asking questions, and actively contributing, is a lot\nmore fun and a better place to learn. When it's not your turn to lecture, you can help\ncreate such a classroom by asking and responding to questions. When you are lecturing,\nyou can try to draw people in to a discussion by asking them questions, and by setting up\nsome short, easy task that everyone can work through, computing out an example for\ninstance. This means that people are immediately applying what you are teaching them\nand hence they understand it and are really ready for the next thing that you introduce. It\nalso keeps everyone interested; it's hard to sit in a long lecture; taking a break to do some\nmathematics makes the class more enjoyable."

Since a\nsurface surrounded by a boundary is minimal if it is an area minimizer, the\nstudy of minimal surface has arised many interesting applications in other\nfields in science, such as soap films.\nIn this book, we have included the lecture notes of a seminar course\nabout minimal surfaces between September and December, 2004. The course\nconsists of a review on multi-variable calculus (Lectures 2 - 4), some basic\ndifferential geometry (Lectures 5 - 10), and representation and properties of\nminimal surface (Lectures 11 - 16). The authors took turns in giving lectures.\nThe target audience of the course was any advanced undergraduate student\nwho had basic analysis and algebra knowledge.\n\nChapter 2\nA Review on Differentiation\nReading: Spivak pp. 15-34, or Rudin 211-220\n2.1\nDifferentiation\nRecall from 18.01 that\nDefinition 2.1.1. A function f : Rn →Rm is differentiable at a ∈Rn if\nthere exists a linear transformation λ : Rn →Rm such that\nlim\nh→0\n|f(a + h) -f(a) -λ(h)|\n|h|\n= 0\n(2.1)\nThe norm in Equation 2.1 is essential since f(a + h) -f(a) -λ(h) is in Rm\nand h is in Rn.\nTheorem 2.1.2. If f : Rn →Rm is differentiable at a ∈Rn, then there is\na unique linear transformation λ : Rn →Rm that satisfies Equation (2.1).\nWe denote λ to be Df(a) and call it the derivative of f at a\nProof. Let μ : Rn →Rm such that\nlim\nh→0\n|f(a + h) -f(a) -μ(h)|\n|h|\n= 0\n(2.2)\n\nand d(h) = f(a + h) -f(a), then\nlim\nh→0\n|λ(h) -μ(h)|\n|h|\n= lim\nh→0\n|λ(h) -d(h) + d(h) -μ(h)|\n|h|\n(2.3)\n≤lim\nh→0\n|λ(h) -d(h)|\n|h|\n+ lim\nh→0\n|d(h) -μ(h)|\n|h|\n(2.4)\n= 0.\n(2.5)\nNow let h = tx where t ∈R and x ∈Rn, then as t →0, tx →0. Thus, for\nx = 0, we have\nlim\nt→0\n|λ(tx) -μ(tx)|\n|tx|\n= |λ(x) -μ(x)|\n|x|\n(2.6)\n= 0\n(2.7)\nThus μ(x) = λ(x).\nAlthough we proved in Theorem 2.1.2 that if Df(a) exists, then it is\nunique. However, we still have not discovered a way to find it. All we can do\nat this moment is just by guessing, which will be illustrated in Example 1.\nExample 1. Let g : R2 →R be a function defined by\ng(x, y) = ln x\n(2.8)\nProposition 2.1.3. Dg(a, b) = λ where λ satisfies\nλ(x, y) = 1\na · x\n(2.9)\nProof.\nlim\n(h,k)→0\n|g(a + h, b + k) -g(a, b) -λ(h, k)|\n|(h, k)|\n=\nlim\n(h,k)→0\n| ln(a + h) -ln(a) -1\na · h|\n|(h, k)|\n(2.10)\n\nSince ln′(a) = 1\na, we have\nlim\nh→0\n| ln(a + h) -ln(a) -1\na · h|\n|h|\n= 0\n(2.11)\nSince |(h, k)| ≥|h|, we have\nlim\n(h,k)→0\n| ln(a + h) -ln(a) -1\na · h|\n|(h, k)|\n= 0\n(2.12)\nDefinition 2.1.4. The Jacobian matrix of f at a is the m × n matrix of\nDf(a) : Rn →Rm with respect to the usual bases of Rn and Rm, and denoted\nf ′(a).\nExample 2. Let g be the same as in Example 1, then\ng′(a, b) = (1\na, 0)\n(2.13)\nDefinition 2.1.5. A function f : Rn →Rm is differentiable on A ⊂Rn if\nf is diffrentiable at a for all a ∈A. On the other hand, if f : A →Rm, A ⊂\nRn, then f is called differentiable if f can be extended to a differentiable\nfunction on some open set containing A.\n2.2\nProperties of Derivatives\nTheorem 2.2.1.\n1. If f : Rn →Rm is a constant function, then ∀a ∈Rn,\nDf(a) = 0.\n(2.14)\n2. If f : Rn →Rm is a linear transformation, then ∀a ∈Rn\nDf(a) = f.\n(2.15)\n\nProof. The proofs are left to the readers\nTheorem 2.2.2. If g : R2 →R is defined by g(x, y) = xy, then\nDg(a, b)(x, y) = bx + ay\n(2.16)\nIn other words, g′(a, b) = (b, a)\nProof. Substitute p and Dp into L.H.S. of Equation 2.1, we have\nlim\n(h,k)→0\n|g(a + h, b + k) -g(a, b) -Dg(a, b)(h, k)|\n|(h, k)|\n=\nlim\n(h,k)→0\n|hk|\n|(h, k)|\n(2.17)\n≤\nlim\n(h,k)→0\nmax(|h|2, |k|2)\n√\nh2 + k2\n(2.18)\n≤\n√\nh2 + k2\n(2.19)\n= 0\n(2.20)\nTheorem 2.2.3. If f : Rn →Rm is differentiable at a, and g : Rm →Rp is\ndifferentiable at f(a), then the composition g *f : Rn →Rp is differentiable\nat a, and\nD(g *f)(a) = Dg(f(a)) *Df(a)\n(2.21)\nProof. Put b = f(a), λ = f ′(a), μ = g′(b), and\nu(h) = f(a + h) -f(a) -λ(h)\n(2.22)\nv(k) = g(b + k) -g(b) -μ(k)\n(2.23)\nfor all h ∈Rn and k ∈Rm. Then we have\n|u(h)| = o(h)|h|\n(2.24)\n|v(k)| = η(k)|k|\n(2.25)\n\nwhere\nlim\nh→0 o(h) = 0\n(2.26)\nlim\nk→0 η(k) = 0\n(2.27)\nGiven h, we can put k such that k = f(a + h) -f(a). Then we have\n|k| = |λ(h) + u(h)| ≤[∥λ∥+ o(h)]|h|\n(2.28)\nThus,\ng *f(a + h) -g *f(a) -μ(λ(h)) = g(b + k) -g(b) -μ(λ(h))\n(2.29)\n= μ(k -λ(h)) + v(k)\n(2.30)\n= μ(u(h)) + v(k)\n(2.31)\nThus\n|g *f(a + h) -g *f(a) -μ(λ(h))|\n|h|\n≤∥μ∥o(h) + [∥λ∥+ o(h)]η(h)\n(2.32)\nwhich equals 0 according to Equation 2.26 and 2.27.\nExercise 1. (Spivak 2-8) Let f : R →R2. Prove that f is differentiable at\na ∈R if and only if f 1 and f 2 are, and that in this case\nf ′(a) =\nA\n(f 1)′(a)\n(f 2)′(a)\n!\n(2.33)\nCorollary 2.2.4. If f : Rn →Rm, then f is differentiable at a ∈Rn if and\n\nonly if each f i is, and\nλ′(a) =\n\n(f 1)′(a)\n(f 2)′(a)\n.\n.\n.\n(f m)′(a)\n\n.\n(2.34)\nThus, f ′(a) is the m × n matrix whose ith row is (f i)′(a)\nCorollary 2.2.5. If f, g : Rn →R are differentiable at a, then\nD(f + g)(a) = Df(a) + Dg(a)\n(2.35)\nD(fg)(a) = g(a)Df(a) + f(a)Dg(a)\n(2.36)\nD(f/g)(a) = g(a)Df(a) -f(a)Dg(a)\n[g(a)]2\n, g(a) = 0\n(2.37)\nProof. The proofs are left to the readers.\n2.3\nPartial Derivatives\nDefinition 2.3.1. If f : Rn →R and a ∈Rn, then the limit\nDif(a) = lim\nh→0\nf(a1, ..., ai + h, ..., an) -f(a1, ..., an)\nh\n(2.38)\nis called the ith partial derivative of f at a if the limit exists.\nIf we denote Dj(Dif)(x) to be Di,j(x), then we have the following theorem\nwhich is stated without proof. (The proof can be found in Problem 3-28 of\nSpivak)\nTheorem 2.3.2. If Di,jf and Dj,if are continuous in an open set containing\na, then\nDi,jf(a) = Dj,if(a)\n(2.39)\n\n-6\n-4\n-2\n-6\n-4\n-2\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\nx\nx2-y2\ny\nPartial derivatives are useful in finding the extrema of functions.\nTheorem 2.3.3. Let A ⊂Rn. If the maximum (or minimum) of f : A →R\noccurs at a point a in the interior of A and Dif(a) exists, then Dif(a) = 0.\nProof. The proof is left to the readers.\nHowever the converse of Theorem 2.3.3 may not be true in all cases.\n(Consider f(x, y) = x2 -y2).\n2.4\nDerivatives\nTheorem 2.4.1. If f : Rn →Rm is differentiable at a, then Djf i(a) exists\nfor 1 ≤i ≤m, 1 ≤j ≤n and f ′(a) is the m × n matrix (Djf i(a)).\n\nChapter 3\nInverse Function Theorem\n(This lecture was given Thursday, September 16, 2004.)\n3.1\nPartial Derivatives\nDefinition 3.1.1. If f : Rn →Rm and a ∈Rn, then the limit\nDif(a) = lim\nh→0\nf(a1, . . . , ai + h, . . . , an) -f(a1, . . . , an)\nh\n(3.1)\nis called the ith partial derivative of f at a, if the limit exists.\nDenote Dj(Dif(x)) by Di,j(x). This is called a second-order (mixed)\npartial derivative.\nThen we have the following theorem (equality of\nmixed partials) which is given without proof.\nThe proof is given later\nin Spivak, Problem 3-28.\nTheorem 3.1.2. If Di,jf and Dj,if are continuous in an open set containing\na, then\nDi,jf(a) = Dj,if(a)\n(3.2)\n\nWe also have the following theorem about partial derivatives and maxima\nand minima which follows directly from 1-variable calculus:\nTheorem 3.1.3. Let A ⊂Rn. If the maximum (or minimum) of f : A →R\noccurs at a point a in the interior of A and Dif(a) exists, then Dif(a) = 0.\nProof: Let gi(x) = f(a1, . . . , x, . . . , an). gi has a maximum (or minimum)\nat ai, and gi is defined in an open interval containing ai. Hence 0 = g′\ni(ai) = 0.\nThe converse is not true: consider f(x, y) = x2 -y2.\nThen f has a\nminimum along the x-axis at 0, and a maximum along the y-axis at 0, but\n(0, 0) is neither a relative minimum nor a relative maximum.\n3.2\nDerivatives\nTheorem 3.2.1. If f : Rn →Rm is differentiable at a, then Djf i(a) exists\nfor 1 ≤i ≤m, 1 ≤j ≤n and f ′(a) is the m x n matrix (Djf i(a)).\nProof: First consider m = 1, so f : Rn →R. Define h : R →Rn by\nh(x) = (a1, . . . , x, . . . , an), with x in the jth slot. Then Djf(a) = (f *h)′(aj).\nApplying the chain rule,\n(f *h)′(aj)\n= f ′(a) · h′(aj)\n= f ′(a) ·\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n(3.3)\n\nThus Djf(a) exists and is the jth entry of the 1 × n matrix f ′(a).\nSpivak 2-3 (3) states that f is differentiable if and only if each f i is. So\nthe theorem holds for arbitrary m, since each f i is differentiable and the ith\nrow of f ′(a) is (f i)′(a).\nThe converse of this theorem - that if the partials exists, then the full\nderivative does - only holds if the partials are continuous.\nTheorem 3.2.2. If f : Rn →Rm, then Df(a) exists if all Djf(i) exist in\nan open set containing a and if each function Djf(i) is continuous at a. (In\nthis case f is called continuously differentiable.)\nProof.: As in the prior proof, it is sufficient to consider m = 1 (i.e.,\nf : Rn →R.)\nf(a + h) -f(a) =\nf(a1 + h1, a2, . . . , an) -f(a1, . . . , an)\n+f(a1 + h1, a2 + h2, a3, . . . , an) -f(a1 + h1, a2, . . . , an)\n+ . . . + f(a1 + h1, . . . , an + hn)\n-f(a1 + h1, . . . , an-1 + hn-1, an).\n(3.4)\nD1f is the derivative of the function g(x) = f(x, a2, . . . , an). Apply the\nmean-value theorem to g :\nf(a1 + h1, a2, . . . , an) -f(a1, . . . , an) = h1 · D1f(b1, a2, . . . , an).\n(3.5)\nfor some b1 between a1 and a1 + h1 . Similarly,\nhi · Dif(a1 + h1, . . . , ai-1 + hi-1, bi, . . . , an) = hiDif(ci)\n(3.6)\n\nfor some ci. Then\nlimh→0\n|f(a+h)-f(a)-P\ni Dif(a)·hi|\n|h|\n= limh→0\nP\ni[Dif(ci)-Dif(a) ·hi]\n|h|\n≤limh→0\nP\ni |Dif(ci) -Dif(a)| · |hi|\n|h|\n≤limh→0\nP\ni |Dif(ci) -Dif(a)|\n= 0\n(3.7)\nsince Dif is continuous at 0.\nExample 3. Let f : R2 →R be the function f(x, y) = xy/(\np\nx2 + y2 if\n(x, y) = (0, 0) and 0 otherwise (when (x, y) = (0, 0)). Find the partial deriva-\ntives at (0, 0) and check if the function is differentiable there.\n3.3\nThe Inverse Function Theorem\n(A sketch of the proof was given in class.)\n\nChapter 4\nImplicit Function Theorem\n4.1\nImplicit Functions\nTheorem 4.1.1. Implicit Function Theorem Suppose f : Rn × Rm -→\nRm is continuously differentiable in an open set containing (a, b) and f(a, b) =\n0. Let M be the m×m matrix Dn+jf i(a, b), 1 ≤i, j ≤m If det(M) = 0, there\nis an open set A ⊂Rn containing a and an open set B ⊂Rm containing b,\nwith the following property: for each x ∈A there is a unique g(x) ∈B such\nthat f(x, g(x)) = 0. The function g is differentiable.\nproof Define F : Rn × Rm -→Rn × Rm by F(x, y) = (x, f(x, y)). Then\ndet(dF(a, b)) = det(M) = 0. By inverse function theorem there is an open\nset W ⊂Rn × Rm containing F(a, b) = (a, 0) and an open set in Rn × Rm\ncontaining (a, b), which we may take to be of the form A × B, such that\nF : A × B -→W has a differentiable inverse h : W -→A × B. Clearly h is\nthe form h(x, y) = (x, k(x, y)) for some differentiable function k (since f is of\nthis form)Let π : Rn ×Rm -→Rm be defined by π(x, y) = y; then π *F = f.\nTherefore f(x, k(x, y)) = f *h(x, y) = (π *F) *h(x, y) = π(x, y) = y Thus\nf(x, k(x, 0)) = 0 in other words we can define g(x) = k(x, 0)\nAs one might expect the position of the m columns that form M is im-\nmaterial. The same proof will work for any f ′(a, b) provided that the rank\n\nof the matrix is m.\nExample f : R2 -→R, f(x, y) = x2 + y2 -1. Df = (2x2y) Let (a, b) =\n(3/5, 4/5) M will be (8/5). Now implicit function theorem guarantees the ex-\nistence and teh uniqueness of g and open intervals I, J ⊂R, 3/5 ∈I, 4/5inJ\nso that g : I -→J is differentiable and x2 + g(x)2 -1 = 0. One can easily\nverify this by choosing I = (-1, 1), J = (0, 1) and g(x) =\n√\n1 -x2. Note\nthat the uniqueness of g(x) would fail to be true if we did not choose J\nappropriately.\nexample Let A be an m × (m + n) matrix. Consider the function f :\nRn+m -→Rm, f(x) = Ax Assume that last m columns Cn+1, Cn+2, ..., Cm+n\nare linearly independent. Break A into blocks A = [A′|M] so that M is\nthe m × m matrix formed by the last m columns of A. Now the equation\nAX = 0 is a system of m linear equations in m + n unknowns so it has a\nnontrivial solution. Moreover it can be solved as follows: Let X = [X1|X2]\nwhere X1 ∈Rn×1 and X2 ∈Rm×1 AX = 0 implies A′X1 +MX2 = 0 ⇒X2 =\nM -1A′X1. Now treat f as a function mapping Rn × Rm -→Rm by setting\nf(X1, X2) = AX . Let f(a, b) = 0. Implicit function theorem asserts that\nthere exist open sets I ⊂Rn, J ⊂Rm and a function g : I -→J so that\nf(x, g(x)) = 0. By what we did above g = M -1A′ is the desired function.\nSo the theorem is true for linear transformations and actually I and J can\nbe chosen Rn and Rm respectively.\n4.2\nParametric Surfaces\n(Following the notation of Osserman En denotes the Euclidean n-space.) Let\nD be a domain in the u-plane, u = (u1, u2). A parametric surface is simply\nthe image of some differentiable transformation u : D -→En.( A non-empty\nopen set in R2 is called a domain.)\nLet us denote the Jacobian matrix of the mapping x(u) by\n\nM = (mij); mij = ∂xi\n∂uj\n, i = 1, 2, .., n; j = 1, 2.\nWe introduce the exterior product\nv ∧w; w ∧v ∈En(n-1)/2\nwhere the components of v ∧w are the determinants det\nA\nvi\nvj\nui\nuj\n!\narranged\nin some fixed order. Finally let\nG = (gij) = M TM; gij = ∂x\n∂ui\n, ∂x\n∂uj\nNote that G is a 2 × 2 matrix. To compute det(G) we recall Lagrange's\nidentity:\nA n\nX\nk=1\na2\nk\n! A n\nX\nk=1\nb2\nk\n!\n-\nA n\nX\nk=1\nakbk\n!2\n=\nX\n1≤i,j≤n\n(aibj -ajbi)2\nProof of Lagrange's identity is left as an exercise. Using Langrange's identity\none can deduce\ndet(G) =\n\n∂x\n∂u1\n∧xu2\n\n=\nX\n1≤i,j≤n\nμ ∂(xi, xj)\n∂(u1, u2)\n¶2\n\nChapter 5\nFirst Fundamental Form\n5.1\nTangent Planes\nOne important tool for studying surfaces is the tangent plane. Given a given\nregular parametrized surface S embedded in Rn and a point p ∈S, a tangent\nvector to S at p is a vector in Rn that is the tangent vector α′(0) of a\ndifferential parametrized curve α: (-o, o) →S with α(0) = p. Then the\ntangent plane Tp(S) to S at p is the set of all tangent vectors to S at p. This\nis a set of R3-vectors that end up being a plane.\nAn equivalent way of thinking of the tangent plane is that it is the image\nof R2 under the linear transformation Dx(q), where x is the map from a\ndomain D →S that defines the surface, and q is the point of the domain that\nis mapped onto p. Why is this equivalent? We can show that x is invertible.\nSo given any tangent vector α′(0), we can look at γ = x-1 *α, which is a\ncurve in D. Then α′(0) = (x *γ)′(0) = (Dx(γ(0)) *γ′)(0) = Dx(q)(γ′(0)).\nNow, γ can be chosen so that γ′(0) is any vector in R2. So the tangent plane\nis the image of R2 under the linear transformation Dx(q).\nCertainly, though, the image of R2 under an invertible linear transfor-\nmation (it's invertible since the surface is regular) is going to be a plane\nincluding the origin, which is what we'd want a tangent plane to be. (When\n\nI say that the tangent plane includes the origin, I mean that the plane itself\nconsists of all the vectors of a plane through the origin, even though usually\nyou'd draw it with all the vectors emanating from p instead of the origin.)\nThis way of thinking about the tangent plane is like considering it as\na \"linearization\" of the surface, in the same way that a tangent line to a\nfunction from R →R is a linear function that is locally similar to the function.\nThen we can understand why Dx(q)(R2) makes sense: in the same way we\ncan \"replace\" a function with its tangent line which is the image of R under\nthe map t 7→f ′(p)t + C, we can replace our surface with the image of R2\nunder the map Dx(q).\nThe interesting part of seeing the tangent plane this way is that you can\nthen consider it as having a basis consisting of the images of (1, 0) and (0, 1)\nunder the map Dx(q). These images are actually just (if the domain in R2\nuses u1 and u2 as variables)\n∂x\n∂u1 and\n∂x\n∂u2 (which are n-vectors).\n5.2\nThe First Fundamental Form\nNizam mentioned the First Fundamental Form. Basically, the FFF is a way\nof finding the length of a tangent vector (in a tangent plane). If w is a tangent\nvector, then |w|2 = w · w. Why is this interesting? Well, it becomes more\ninteresting if you're considering w not just as its R3 coordinates, but as a\nlinear combination of the two basis vectors\n∂x\n∂u1 and\n∂x\n∂u2. Say w = a ∂x\n∂u1 +b ∂x\n∂u2;\nthen\n|w|2\n=\na ∂x\n∂u1 + b ∂x\n∂u2\n\n·\na ∂x\n∂u1 + b ∂x\n∂u2\n\n= a2 ∂x\n∂u1 · ∂x\n∂u1 + 2ab ∂x\n∂u1 · ∂x\n∂u2 + b2 ∂x\n∂u2 · ∂x\n∂u2.\n(5.1)\nLet's deal with notational differences between do Carmo and Osserman.\ndo Carmo writes this as Ea2 + 2Fab + Gb2, and refers to the whole thing as\nIp : Tp(S) →R.1 Osserman lets g11 = E, g12 = g21 = F (though he never\n1Well, actully he's using u′ and v′ instead of a and b at this point, which is because\nthese coordinates come from a tangent vector, which is to say they are the u′(q) and v′(q)\n\nmakes it too clear that these two are equal), and g22 = G, and then lets the\nmatrix that these make up be G, which he also uses to refer to the whole\nform. I am using Osserman's notation.\nNow we'll calculate the FFF on the cylinder over the unit circle; the\nparametrized surface here is x: (0, 2π) × R →S ⊂R3 defined by x(u, v) =\n(cos u, sin u, v).\n(Yes, this misses a vertical line of the cylinder; we'll fix\nthis once we get away from parametrized surfaces.) First we find that ∂x\n∂u =\n(-sin u, cos u, 0) and ∂x\n∂v = (0, 0, 1). Thus g11 = ∂x\n∂u · ∂x\n∂u = sin2 u + cos2 u = 1,\ng21 = g12 = 0, and g22 = 1. So then |w|2 = a2 + b2, which basically means\nthat the length of a vector in the tangent plane to the cylinder is the same\nas it is in the (0, 2π) × R that it's coming from.\nAs an exercise, calculate the first fundamental form for the sphere S2\nparametrized by x: (0, π) × (0, 2π) →S2 with\nx(θ, φ) = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ).\n(5.2)\nWe first calculate that\n∂x\n∂θ = (cos θ cos φ, cos θ sin φ, -sin θ) and\n∂x\n∂φ =\n(-sin θ sin φ, sin θ cos φ, 0). So we find eventually that |w|2 = a2 + b2 sin2 θ.\nThis makes sense -- movement in the φ direction (latitudinally) should be\n\"worth more\" closer to the equator, which is where sin2 θ is maximal.\n5.3\nArea\nIf we recall the exterior product from last time, we can see that\n∂x\n∂u ∧∂x\n∂v\nis\nthe area of the parallelogram determined by ∂x\n∂u and ∂x\n∂v. This is analogous to\nthe fact that in 18.02 the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors is\nthe area of the parallelogram they determine. Then\nR\nQ\n∂x\n∂u ∧∂x\n∂v\ndudv is the\narea of the bounded region Q in the surface. But Nizam showed yesterday\nof some curve in the domain D.\n\nthat Lagrange's Identity implies that\n\n∂x\n∂u ∧∂x\n∂v\n\n=\n\n∂x\n∂u\n\n∂x\n∂v\n\n-\nμ∂x\n∂u · ∂x\n∂v\n¶2\n(5.3)\nThus\n∂x\n∂u ∧∂x\n∂v\n=\np\ng11g22 -g2\n12.

Differentiability\nhere means that each of our coordinate functions are differentiable: if α is a\nmap from some I to R3, and α = (x(t), y(t), z(t)), then α being differentiable\nis saying that x(t), y(t), and z(t) are all differentiable. The vector α′(t) =\n(x′(t), y′(t), z′(t)) is called the tangent vector of α at t.\nOne thing to note is that, as with our notation for surfaces, our curve is\na differentiable map, and not a subset of Rn. do Carmo calls the image set\nα(I) ⊂R3 the trace of α. But multiple \"curves,\" i.e., differentiable maps,\ncan have the same image or trace. For example,\nExample 4. Let\nα(t) = (cos(t), sin(t))\n(6.1)\nβ(t) = (cos(2t), sin(2t))\n(6.2)\nγ(t) = (cos(-t), sin(-t))\n(6.3)\nwith t in the interval (-o, 2π + o).\n\nThen the image of α , β, and γ are all the same, namely, the unit circle\ncentered at the origin. But the velocity vector of β is twice that of α's, and\nγ runs as fast as α does, but in the opposite direction - the orientation of\nthe curve is reversed. (In general, when we have a curve α defined on (a, b),\nand define γ(-t) = α(t) on (-b, -a), we say α and γ differ by a change of\norientation.)\n6.2\nArc Length and Curvature\nNow we want to describe properties of curves. A natural one to start with\nis arc length. We define the arc length s of a curve α from a time t0 to a\ntime t as follows\ns(t) =\nZ t\nt0\nds\n(6.4)\n=\nZ t\nt0\nds\ndt dt\n(6.5)\n=\nZ t\nt0\n|α′(t)|dt\n(6.6)\nThe next property that we would like to define is curvature. We want\ncurvature to reflect properties of the image of our curve - i.e., the actual\nsubset C in Rn - as opposed to our map. Letting our curvature vector be\ndefined as α′′(t) has the problem that, while it measures how fast the tangent\nvector is changing along the curve, it also measures how large our velocity\nvector is, which can vary for maps with the same image. Looking back at\nExample 1, while both α and β's images were the unit circle, the velocity\nand acceleration vectors were different:\n\nα′(t) = (-sin t, cos t)\n(6.7)\nα′′(t) = (-cos t, -sin t), |α′′(t)| = 1\n(6.8)\nβ′(t) = (-2 sin(2t), 2 cos(2t))\n(6.9)\nβ′′(t) = (-4 cos(2t), -4 sin(2t)), |β′′(t)| = 4\n(6.10)\nA way to correct this problem is to scale our velocity vector down to unit\nlength - i.e., let ds/dt = 1. Then the magnitude of the velocity vector won't\nskew our curvature vector, and we'll just be able to look at how much the\nangle between neighboring tangent vectors is changing when we look at α′′(t)\n(how curved our curve is!)\nTo do this we parameterize by arc length. First, we look at the arc\nlength function s(t) =\nR t\nt0 |α′(t)|dt. If α′(t) = 0 for all t, then our function\nis always increasing and thus has an inverse s-1.\nSo instead of mapping\nfrom time, along an interval I, into length, we can map from length into an\ninterval I.\nDefinition 6.2.1. : A paramaterized differentiable curve α : I →R3 is\nregular if α′(t) = 0 for all t ∈I.\nThus to parameterize by arc length, we require our curve to be regular.\nThen, given a fixed starting point t0 going to a fixed end point t1, and the\nlength of our arc from t0 to t1 being L, we can reparameterize as follows:\n(0, L) →(t0, t1) →R3 (or Rn.)\nwhere the first arrow is given by s-1, and the second arrow is just our curve\nα mapping into real-space. If s ∈(0, L), and our reparameterized curve is β,\nthen β and α have the same image,and also |β′(s)| is |dt/ds · α′(t)| = 1. So\nafter reparamterizing by arc length, we have fixed the length of our velocity\nvector to be 1.\nNow we can properly define curvature.\n\nDefinition 6.2.2. Let α be a curve paramaterized by arc length. Then we\nsay that α′′(s) (where s denotes length) is the curvature vector of α at\ns, and the curvature at s is the norm of the curvature vector, |α′′(s)|.\nExample 5. Let's go back to the example of a circle, in this case with radius\nr.\nα(t) = (r sin(t), r cos(t)), and α′(t) = (r cos t, -r sin t). So |α′(t)| = r,\nand not 1. In order to correct for this, set\nβ(s) = (r sin(s/r), r cos(s/r)). Then β′(s) = (cos(s/r), -sin(s/r)) and\n|β′(s)| = 1. Our circle is now parameterized by arc length.\nThe curvature vector at a given length s is then\nβ′′(t) = (-(1/r) sin(s/r), -(1/r) cos(s/r))\n(6.11)\nand |β′′(s)| = 1/r. Appropriately, the bigger our circle is, the smaller the\ncurvature.\nExercise 2. Now we take a catenary, the curve we get if we hang a string\nfrom two poles.\nLet α(t) = (t, cosh t), where cosh(t) = (1/2)(et + e-t). Parameterize by\narc length and check that it works. The identities sinh(t) = (1/2)(et -e-t)\nand sinh-1(t) = ln(t + (t2 + 1)1/2) will be of use.\n\nChapter 7\nTangent Planes\nReading: Do Carmo sections 2.4 and 3.2\nToday I am discussing\n1.

Let x : U ⊂R2 →S be a parameterization of a\nregular surface S and let q ∈U. The vector subspace of dimension 2,\ndxq(R2) ⊂R3\n(7.1)\ncoincides with the set of tangent vectors to S at x(q). We call the plane\ndxq(R2) the Tangent Plane to S at p, denoted by Tp(S).\n\n-ε\nε\nu\nv\nx\nq\np\nS\nt\nα\nβ\nβ'(0)\nU\nα'(0)\nFigure 7.1: Graphical representation of the map dxq that sends β′(0) ∈Tq(R2\nto α′(0) ∈Tp(S).\nNote that the plane dxq(R2) does not depend on the parameterization x.\nHowever, the choice of the parameterization determines the basis on Tp(S),\nnamely {( ∂x\n∂u)(q), ( ∂x\n∂v )(q)}, or {xu(q), xv(q)}.\n7.1.2\nCoordinates of w ∈Tp(S) in the Basis Associated\nto Parameterization x\nLet w be the velocity vector α′(0), where α = x *β is a curve in the surface\nS, and the map β : (-o, o) →U, β(t) = (u(t), v(t)). Then in the basis of\n{xu(q), xv(q)}, we have\nw = (u′(0), v′(0))\n(7.2)\n\n7.1.3\nDifferential of a (Differentiable) Map Between\nSurfaces\nIt is natural to extend the idea of differential map from T(R2) →T(S) to\nT(S1) →T(S2).\nLet S1, S2 be two regular surfaces, and a differential mapping φ ⊂S1 →\nS2 where V is open. Let p ∈V , then all the vectors w ∈Tp(S1) are velocity\nvectors α′(0) of some differentiable parameterized curve α : (-o, o) →V with\nα(0) = p.\nDefine β = φ *α with β(0) = φ(p), then β′(0) is a vector of Tφ(p)(S2).\n(Proposition 2-4-2). Given w, the velocity vector β′(0) does not depend\non the choice of α. Moreover, the map\ndφp : Tp(S1) →Tφ(p)(S2)\n(7.3)\ndφp(w) = β′(0)\n(7.4)\nis linear. We call the linear map dφp to be the differential of φ at p ∈S1.\nProof. Suppose φ is expressed in φ(u, v) = (φ1(u, v), φ2(u, v)), and α(t) =\n(u(t), v(t)), t ∈(-o, o) is a regular curve on the surface S1. Then\nβ(t) = (φ1(u(t), v(t)), φ2(u(t), v(t)).\n(7.5)\nDifferentiating β w.r.t. t, we have\nβ′(0) =\nμ∂φ1\n∂u u′(0) + φ1\n∂vv′(0), ∂φ2\n∂u u′(0) + φ2\n∂vv′(0)\n¶\n(7.6)\nin the basis of ( xu, xv).\nAs shown above, β′(0) depends on the map φ and the coordinates of\n(u′(0), v′(0) in the basis of {xu, xv}.\nTherefore, it is independent on the\nchoice of α.\n\n-ε\nε\nt\nx\np\nα'(0)\nS\nα\nβ\nφ\nV\n(p)\nS\n'(0)\nφ\nβ\nu\nv\nu\nv\nq\nq\nx\nx\nFigure 7.2: Graphical representation of the map dφp that sends α′(0) ∈\nTq(S1) to β′(0) ∈Tp(S2).\nMoreover, Equation 7.6 can be expressed as\nβ′(0) = dφp(w) =\nA ∂φ1\n∂u\n∂φ1\n∂v\n∂φ2\n∂u\n∂φ2\n∂v\n! A\nu′(0)\nv′(0)\n!\n(7.7)\nwhich shows that the map dφp is a mapping from Tp(S1) to Tφ(p)(S2). Note\nthat the 2 × 2 matrix is respect to the basis {xu, xv} of Tp(S1) and { xu, xv}\nof Tφ(p)(S2) respectively.\nWe can define the differential of a (differentiable) function f : U ⊂S →R\nat p ∈U as a linear map dfp : Tp(S) →R.\nExample 2-4-1: Differential of the height function Let v ∈R3. Con-\n\nsider the map\nh : S ⊂R3 →R\n(7.8)\nh(p) = v · p, p ∈S\n(7.9)\nWe want to compute the differential dhp(w), w ∈Tp(S). We can choose a\ndifferential curve α : (-o, o)) →S such that α(0) = p and α′(0) = w. We\nare able to choose such α since the differential dhp(w) is independent on the\nchoice of α. Thus\nh(α(t)) = α(t) · v\n(7.10)\nTaking derivatives, we have\ndhp(w) = d\ndth(α(t))|t=0 = α′(0) · v = w · v\n(7.11)\nExample 2-4-2: Differential of the rotation Let S2 ⊂R3 be the unit\nsphere\nS2 = {(x, y, z) ∈R3; x2 + y2 + z2 = 1}\n(7.12)\nConsider the map\nRz,θ : R3 →R3\n(7.13)\nbe the rotation of angle θ about the z axis.\nWhen Rz,θ is restricted to\nS2, it becomes a differential map that maps S2 into itself. For simplicity,\nwe denote the restriction map Rz,θ. We want to compute the differential\n(dRz,θ)p(w), p ∈S2, w ∈Tp(S2). Let α : (-o, o) →S2 be a curve on S2 such\nthat α(0) = p, α′(0) = w. Now\n(dRz,θ)(w) = d\ndt(Rz,θ *α(t))t=0 = Rz,θ(α′(0)) = Rz,θ(w)\n(7.14)\n\n7.1.4\nInverse Function Theorem\nAll we have done is extending differential calculus in R2 to regular surfaces.\nThus, it is natural to have the Inverse Function Theorem extended to the\nregular surfaces.\nA mapping φ : U ⊂S1 →S2 is a local diffeomorphism at p ∈U if\nthere exists a neighborhood V ⊂U of p, such that φ restricted to V is a\ndiffeomorphism onto the open set φ(V ) ⊂S2.\n(Proposition 2-4-3). Let S1, S2 be regular surfaces and φ : U ⊂S1 →\nS2 a differentiable mapping. If dφp : Tp(S1) →Tφ(p)(S2) at p ∈U is an\nisomorphism, then φ is a local diffeomorphism at p.\nThe proof is a direct application of the inverse function theorem in R2.\n7.2\nThe Geometry of Gauss Map\nIn this section we will extend the idea of curvature in curves to regular sur-\nfaces. Thus, we want to study how rapidly a surface S pulls away from the\ntangent plane Tp(S) in a neighborhood of p ∈S. This is equivalent to mea-\nsuring the rate of change of a unit normal vector field N on a neighborhood\nof p. We will show that this rate of change is a linear map on Tp(S) which is\nself adjoint.\n7.2.1\nOrientation of Surfaces\nGiven a parameterization x : U ⊂R2 →S of a regular surface S at a point\np ∈S, we choose a unit normal vector at each point x(U) by\nN(q) = xu ∧xv\n|xu ∧xv|(q), q ∈x(U)\n(7.15)\nWe can think of N to be a map N : x(U) →R3. Thus, each point q ∈x(U)\nhas a normal vector associated to it. We say that N is a differential field\n\nof unit normal vectors on U.\nWe say that a regular surface is orientable if it has a differentiable field\nof unit normal vectors defined on the whole surface. The choice of such a\nfield N is called an orientation of S. An example of non-orientable surface\nis M obius strip (see Figure 3).\nFigure 7.3: M obius strip, an example of non-orientable surface.\nIn this section (and probably for the rest of the course), we will only\nstudy regular orientable surface. We will denote S to be such a surface with\nan orientation N which has been chosen.\n7.2.2\nGauss Map\n(Definition 3-2-1). Let S ⊂R3 be a surface with an orientation N and\nS2 ⊂R3 be the unit sphere\nS2 = {(x, y, z) ∈R3; x2 + y2 + z2 = 1}.\n(7.16)\nThe map N : S →S2 is called the Gauss map.\nThe map N is differentiable since the differential,\ndNp : Tp(S) →TN(p)(S2)\n(7.17)\n\nat p ∈S is a linear map.\nFor a point p ∈S, we look at each curve α(t) with α(0) = p and compute\nN *α(t) = N(t) where we define that map N : (-o, o) →S2 with the same\nnotation as the normal field. By this method, we restrict the normal vector\nN to the curve α(t). The tangent vector N ′(0) ∈Tp(S2) thus measures the\nrate of change of the normal vector N restrict to the curve α(t) at t = 0. In\nother words, dNp measure how N pulls away from N(p) in a neighborhood\nof p. In the case of the surfaces, this measure is given by a linear map.\nExample 3-2-1 (Trivial) Consider S to be the plane ax + by + cz + d = 0,\nthe tangent vector at any point p ∈S is given by\nN =\n(a, b, c)\n√\na2 + b2 + c2\n(7.18)\nSince N is a constant throughout S, dN = 0.\nExample 3-2-2 (Gauss map on the Unit Sphere)\nConsider S = S2 ⊂R3, the unit sphere in the space R3. Let α(t) =\n(x(t), y(t), z(t)) be a curve on S, then we have\n2xx′ + 2yy′ + 2zz′ = 0\n(7.19)\nwhich means that the vector (x, y, z) is normal to the surface at the point\n(x,y,z).\nWe will choose N = (-x, -y, -z) to be the normal field of S.\nRestricting to the curve α(t), we have\nN(t) = (-x(t), -y(t), -z(t))\n(7.20)\nand therefore\ndN(x′(t), y′(t), z′(t)) = (-x′(t), -y′(t), -z′(t))\n(7.21)\nor dNp(v) = -v for all p ∈S and v ∈Tp(S2).\n\nExample 3-2-4 (Exercise: Gauss map on a hyperbolic paraboloid)\nFind the differential dNp=(0,0,0) of the normal field of the paraboloid S ⊂R3\ndefined by\nx(u, v) = (u, v, v2 -u2)\n(7.22)\nunder the parameterization x : U ⊂R2 →S.\n7.2.3\nSelf-Adjoint Linear Maps and Quadratic Forms\nLet V now be a vector space of dimension 2 endowed with an inner product\n⟨, ⟩.\nLet A : V →V be a linear map. If ⟨Av, w⟩= ⟨v, Aw⟩for all v, w ∈V ,\nthen we call A to be a self-adjoint linear map.\nLet {e1, e2} be a orthonormal basis for V and (αij), i, j = 1, 2 be the\nmatrix elements of A in this basis. Then, according to the axiom of self-\nadjoint, we have\n⟨Aei, ej⟩= αij = ⟨ei, Aej⟩= ⟨Aej, ei⟩= αji\n(7.23)\nThere A is symmetric.\nTo each self-adjoint linear map, there is a bilinear map B : V × V →R\ngiven by\nB(v, w) = ⟨Av, w⟩\n(7.24)\nIt is easy to prove that B is a bilinear symmetric form in V .\nFor each bilinear form B in V , there is a quadratic form Q : V →R\ngiven by\nQ(v) = B(v, v), v ∈V.\n(7.25)\nExercise (Trivial): Show that\nB(u, v) = 1\n2 [Q(u + v) -Q(v) -Q(u)]\n(7.26)\n\nTherefore, there is a 1-1 correspondence between quadratic form and self-\nadjoint linear maps of V .\nGoal for the rest of this section: Show that given a self-adjoint linear\nmap A : V →V , there exist a orthonormal basis for V such that, relative\nto this basis, the matrix A is diagonal matrix. Moreover, the elements of\nthe diagonal are the maximum and minimum of the corresponding quadratic\nform restricted to the unit circle of V .\n(Lemma (Exercise)). If Q(x, y) = ax2 = 2bxy+cy2 restricted to {(x, y); x2+\ny2 = 1} has a maximum at (1, 0), then b = 0\nHint: Reparametrize (x, y) using x = cos t, y = cos t, t ∈(-o, 2π + o) and\nset dQ\ndt |t=0 = 0.\n(Proposition 3A-1). Given a quadratic form Q in V , there exists an\northonormal basis {e1, e2} of V such that if v ∈V is given by v = xe1 + ye2,\nthen\nQ(v) = λ1x2 + λ2y2\n(7.27)\nwhere λi, i = 1, 2 are the maximum and minimum of the map Q on |v| = 1\nrespectively.\nProof. Let λ1 be the maximum of Q on the circle |v| = 1, and e1 to be\nthe unit vector with Q(e1) = λ1. Such e1 exists by continuity of Q on the\ncompact set |v| = 1.\nNow let e2 to be the unit vector orthonormal to e1, and let λ2 = Q(e2).\nWe will show that this set of basis satisfy the proposition.\nLet B be a bilinear form associated to Q. If v = xe1 + ye2, then\nQ(v) = B(v, v) = λ1x2 + 2bxy + λ2y2\n(7.28)\nwhere b = B(e1, e2). From previous lemma, we know that b = 0. So now it\nsuffices to show that λ2 is the minimum of Q on |v| = 1. This is trivial since\n\nwe know that x2 + y2 = 1 and\nQ(v) = λ1x2 + λ2y2 ≥λ2(x2 + y2) = λ2\n(7.29)\nas λ2 ≤λ1.\nIf v = 0, then v is called the eigenvector of A : V →V if Av = λv for\nsome real λ. We call the λ the corresponding eigenvalue.\n(Theorem 3A-1). Let A : V →V be a self-adjoint linear map, then there\nexist an orthonormal basis {e1, e2} of V such that\nA(e1) = λ1e1,\nA(e2) = λ2e2.\n(7.30)\nThus, A is diagonal in this basis and λi, i = 1, 2 are the maximum and\nminimum of Q(v) = ⟨Av, v⟩on the unit circle of V .\nProof. Consider Q(v) = ⟨Av, v⟩where v = (x, y) in the basis of ei, i = 1, 2.\nRecall from the previous lemma that Q(x, y) = ax2 + cy2 for some a, c ∈R.\nWe have Q(e1) = Q(1, 0) = a, Q(e2) = Q(0, 1) = c, therefore Q(e1 + e2) =\nQ(1, 1) = a + c and\nB(e1, e2) = 1\n2[Q(e1 + e2) -Q(e1) -Q(e2)] = 0\n(7.31)\nThus, Ae1 is either parallel to e1 or equal to 0. In any case, we have Ae1 =\nλ1e1. Using B(e1, e2) = ⟨Ae2, e1⟩= 0 and ⟨Ae2, e2⟩= λ2, we have Ae2 =\nλ2e2.\nNow let us go back to the discussion of Gauss map.\n(Proposition 3-2-1). The differential map dNp : Tp(S) →Tp(S) of the\nGauss map is a self-adjoint linear map.\nProof. It suffices to show that\n⟨dNp(w1), w2⟩= ⟨w1, dNp(w2)⟩\n(7.32)\n\nfor the basis {w1, w2} of Tp(S).\nLet x(u, v) be a parameterization of S at p, then xu, xv is a basis of Tp(S).\nLet α(t) = x(u(t), v(t)) be a parameterized curve in S with α(0) = p, we\nhave\ndNp(α′(0)) = dNp(xuu′(0) + xvv′(0))\n(7.33)\n= d\ndtN(u(t), v(t))|t=0\n(7.34)\n= Nuu′(0) + Nvv′(0)\n(7.35)\nwith dNp(xu) = Nu and dNp(xv) = Nv. So now it suffices to show that\n⟨Nu, xv⟩= ⟨xu, Nv⟩\n(7.36)\nIf we take the derivative of ⟨N, xu⟩= 0 and ⟨N, xv⟩= 0, we have\n⟨Nv, xu⟩+ ⟨N, xuv⟩= 0\n(7.37)\n⟨Nu, xv⟩+ ⟨N, xvu⟩= 0\n(7.38)\nTherefore\n⟨Nu, xv⟩= -⟨N, xuv⟩= ⟨Nv, xu⟩\n(7.39)\n\nChapter 8\nGauss Map I\n8.1\n\"Curvature\" of a Surface\nWe've already discussed the curvature of a curve. We'd like to come up with\nan analogous concept for the \"curvature\" of a regular parametrized surface S\nparametrized by x: U →Rn. This can't be just a number -- we need at the\nvery least to talk about the \"curvature of S at p in the direction v ∈Tp(S)\".\nSo given v ∈Tp(S), we can take a curve α: I →S such that α(0) = p\nand α′(0) = v. (This exists by the definition of the tangent plane.) The\ncurvature of α itself as a curve in Rn is d2α\nds2 (note that this is with respect\nto arc length). However, this depends on the choice of α -- for example,\nif you have the cylinder over the unit circle, and let v be in the tangential\ndirection, both a curve that just goes around the cylinder and a curve that\nlooks more like a parabola that happens to be going purely tangentially at p\nhave the same α′, but they do not have the same curvature. But if we choose\na field of normal vectors N on the surface, then d2α\nds2 ·Np is independent of the\nchoice of α (as long as α(0) = p and α′(0) = v). It's even independent of the\nmagnitude of v -- it only depends on its direction ˆv. We call this curvature\nkp(N, ˆv). For the example, we can see that the first curve's α′′ is 0, and that\nthe second one's α′′ points in the negative ˆz direction, whereas N points in\n\nthe radial direction, so kp(N, ˆv) is zero no matter which α you choose.\n(In 3-space with a parametrized surface, we can always choose N to be\nN =\nxu∧xv\n|xu∧xv|.)\nTo prove this, we see that α(s) = x(u1(s), u2(s)), so that dα\nds = du1\nds xu1 +\ndu2\nds xu2 and d2α\nds2 = d2u1\nds xu1+du1\nds\n¡ du1\nds xu1u1 + du2\ns xu1u2\n¢\n+d2u2\nds xu2+du2\nds\n¡du1\nds xu1u2 + du2\ns xu2u2\n¢\n.\nBut by normality, N · xu1 = N · xu2 = 0, so d2α\nds2 · N = P2\ni,j=1 bij(N) dui\nds\nduj\nds ,\nwhere bij(N) = xuiuj · N.\nWe can put the values bij into a matrix B(N) = [bij(N)]. It is symmetric,\nand so it defines a symmetric quadratic form B = II : Tp(S) →R. If we use\n{xu1, xu2} as a basis for Tp(S), then II(cxu1+dxu2) = ( c d )\nb11(N) b12(N)\nb21(N) b22(N)\n¡ c\nd\n¢\n.\nWe call II the Second Fundamental Form.\nII is independent of α, since it depends only on the surface (not on α).\nTo show that kp(N, ˆv) is independent of choice of α, we see that\nkp(N, ˆV ) = d2α\nds2 · N =\nX\nij\nbij(N)dui\nds\nduj\nds =\nP\ni,j bij(N) dui\ndt\nduj\ndt\n¡ ds\ndt\n¢2\nNow, s(t) =\nR t\nt0 |α′(t)| dt, so that\n¡ds\ndt\n¢2 = |α′(t)|2 = |du1\ndt xu1 + du2\ndt xu2|2 =\nP\ni,j\n¡ dui\ndt\n¢ 3\nduj\ndt\n\ngij, where gij comes from the First Fundamental Form. So\nkp(N, ˆv) =\nP\ni,j bij(N) dui\ndt\nduj\ndt\nP\ni,j gij\ndui\ndt\nduj\ndt\nThe numerator is just the First Fundamental Form of v, which is to say its\nlength. So the only property of α that this depends on are the derivatives\nof its components at p, which are just the components of the given vector v.\nAnd in fact if we multiply v by a scalar λ, we multiply both the numerator\nand the denominator by λ2, so that kp(N, ˆv) doesn't change. So kp(N, ˆv)\ndepends only on the direction of v, not its magnitude.\nIf we now let k1(N)p be the maximum value of kp(N, ˆv).\nThis exists\nbecause ˆv is chosen from the compact set S1 ⊂Tp(S).\nSimilarly, we let\n\nk2(N)p be the minimal value of kp(N, ˆv).\nThese are called the principle\ncurvatures of S at p with regards to N. The directions e1 and e2 yielding\nthese curvatures are called the principal directions. It will turn out that these\nare the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a linear operator defined by the Gauss\nmap.\n8.2\nGauss Map\nRecall that for a surface x: U →S in R3, we can define the Gauss map\nN : S →S2 which sends p to Np =\nxu1∧xu2\n|xu1∧xu2|, the unit normal vector at p.\nThen dNp : Tp(S) →TNp(S2); but Tp(S) and TNp(S2) are the same plane\n(they have the same normal vector), so we can see this as a linear operator\nTp(S) →Tp(S).\nFor example, if S = S2, then Np = p, so Np is a linear transform so it is\nits own derivative, so dNp is also the identity.\nFor example, if S is a plane, then Np is constant, so its derivative is the\nzero map.\nFor example, if S is a right cylinder defined by (θ, z) 7→(cos θ, sin θ, z),\nthen N(x, y, z) = (x, y, 0). (We can see this because the cylinder is defined\nby x2 + y2 = 1, so 2xx′ + 2yy′ = 0, which means that (x, y, 0) · (x′, y′, z′) = 0,\nso that (x, y, 0) is normal to the velocity of any vector through (x, y, z).)\nLet us consider the curve α with α(t) = (cos t, sin t, z(t)), then α′(t) =\n(-sin t, cos t, z′(t)).\nSo (N *α)(t) = (x(t), y(t), 0), and so (N *α)′(t) =\n(-sin t, cos t, 0). So dNp(xθ) = xθ. So in the basis {xθ, xz}, the matrix is\n¡ 1 0\n0 0\n¢\n. It has determinant 0 and 1\n2 trace equal to 1\n2. It turns out that the\ndeterminant of this matrix only depends on the First Fundamental Form,\nand not how it sits in space -- this is why the determinant is the same for\nthe cylinder and the plane. A zero eigenvalue can't go away no matter how\nyou curve the surface, as long as you don't stretch it.\n\nChapter 9\nGauss Map II\n9.1\nMean and Gaussian Curvatures of Sur-\nfaces in R3\nWe'll assume that the curves are in R3 unless otherwise noted. We start off\nby quoting the following useful theorem about self adjoint linear maps over\nR2:\nTheorem 9.1.1 (Do Carmo pp. 216). : Let V denote a two dimensional\nvector space over R. Let A : V →V be a self adjoint linear map. Then there\nexists an orthonormal basis e1, e2 of V such that A(e1) = λ1e1, and A(e2) =\nλ2e2 ( that is, e1 and e2 are eigenvectors, and λ1 and λ2 are eigenvalues of\nA). In the basis e1, e2, the matrix of A is clearly diagonal and the elements λ1,\nλ2, λ1 ≥λ2, on the diagonal are the maximum and minimum, respectively,\nof the quadratic form Q(v) = ⟨Av, v⟩on the unit circle of V.\nProposition 9.1.2. : The differential dNp : Tp(S) →Tp(S) of the Gauss\nmap is a self-adjoint linear map.\nProof. Since dNp is linear, it suffices to verify that ⟨dNp(w1), w2⟩= ⟨w1, dNp(w2)⟩\nfor a basis w1, w2 of Tp(S).\nLet x(u, v) be a parametrization of S at P\n\nand xu, xv be the associated basis of Tp(S).\nIf α(t) = x(u(t), v(t)) is a\nparametrized curve in S with α(0) = p, we have\ndNp(α′(0)) = dNp(xuu′(0) + xvv′(0))\n(9.1)\n= d\ndtN(u(t), v(t))|t=0\n(9.2)\n= Nuu′(0) + Nvv′(0)\n(9.3)\nin particular, dNp(xu) = Nu and dNp(xv) = Nv. Therefore to prove that dNp\nis self adjoint, it suffices to show that\n⟨Nu, xv⟩= ⟨xu, Nv⟩.\n(9.4)\nTo see this, take the derivatives of ⟨N, xu⟩= 0 and ⟨N, xv⟩= 0, relative to v\nand u respectively, and obtain\n⟨Nv, xu⟩+ ⟨N, xuv⟩= 0,\n(9.5)\n⟨Nu, xv⟩+ ⟨N, xuv⟩= 0,\n(9.6)\nThus,\n⟨Nu, xv⟩= -⟨N, xuv⟩= ⟨Nv, xu⟩\n(9.7)\nNow given that dNp is self-adjoint one can think of the associated quadratic\nform.\nDefinition 9.1.3. The quadratic form IIp defined in Tp(S) by IIp(v) =\n-⟨dNp(v), v⟩is called the second fundamental form of S at p.\nNow that we have two definitions for the second fundamental form we bet-\nter show that they're equivalent. (Recall from the last lecture that IIp(α′(0)) =\n⟨N(0), α′′(0)⟩where α is considered as a function of arc length.)\n\nLet N(s) denote the restriction of normal to the curve α(s). We have\n⟨N(s), α′(s)⟩= 0 Differentiating yields\n⟨N(s), α′′(s)⟩= -⟨N ′(s), α′(s)⟩.\n(9.8)\nTherefore,\nIIp(α′(0))\n= -⟨dNp(α′(0)), α′(0)⟩\n= -⟨N ′(0), α′(0)⟩\n= ⟨N(0), α′′(0)⟩\n(9.9)\nwhich agrees with our previous definition.\nDefinition 9.1.4. : The maximum normal curvature k1 and the minimum\nnormal curvature k2 are called the principal curvatures at p; and the corre-\nsponding eigenvectors are called principal directions at p.\nSo for instance if we take cylinder k1 = 0 and k2 = -1 for all points p.\nDefinition 9.1.5. : If a regular connected curve C on S is such that for all\np ∈C the tangent line of C is a principal direction at p, then C is said to be\na line of curvature of S.\nFor cylinder a circle perpendicular to axis and the axis itself are lines of\ncurvature of the cylinder.\nProposition 9.1.6. A necessary and sufficient condition for a connected\nregular curve X on S to be a line of curvature of S is that\nN ′(t) = λ(t)α′(t)\nfor any parametrization α(t) of C, where N(t) = N(α(t)) and λ is a differ-\nentiable function of t. In this case, -λ(t) is the principal curvature along\nα′(t)\nProof. : Obvious since principal curvature is an eigenvalue of the linear trans-\nformation N ′.\n\nA nice application of the principal directions is computing the normal\ncurvature along a given direction of Tp(s). If e1 and e2 are two orthogonal\neigenvectors of unit length then one can represent any unit tangent vector as\nv = e1 cos θ + e2 sin θ\n(9.10)\nThe normal curvature along v is given by\nIIp(v)\n= -⟨dNp(v), v⟩\n= k1cos2θ + k2sin2θ\n(9.11)\nDefinition 9.1.7. Let p ∈S and let dNp : Tp(S) →Tp(S) be the differential\nof the Gauss map. The determinant of dNp is the Gaussian curvature K at\np. The negative of half of the trace of dNp is called the mean curvature H of\nS at p.\nIn terms of principal curvatures we can write\nK = k1k2, H = k1 + k2\n(9.12)\nDefinition 9.1.8. : A point of a surface S is called\n1. Elliptic if K > 0,\n2. Hyperbolic if K < 0,\n3. Parabolic if K = 0, with dNp = 0\n4. Planar if dNp = 0\nNote that above definitions are independent of the choice of the orienta-\ntion.\nDefinition 9.1.9. Let p be a point in S. An asymptotic direction of S at p\nis a direction of Tp(S) for which the normal curvature is zero. An asymptotic\ncurve of S is a regular connected curve C ⊂S such that for each p ∈C the\ntangent line of C at p is an asymptotic direction.\n\n9.2\nGauss Map in Local Coordinates\nLet x(u, v) be a parametrization at a point p ∈S of a surface S, and let\nα(t) = x(u(t), v(t)) be a parametrized curve on S, with α(0) = p To simplify\nthe notation, we shall make the convention that all functions to appear below\ndenote their values at the point p.\nThe tangent vector to α(t) at p is α′ = xuu + xvv and\ndN(α′) = N ′(u(t), v(t)) = Nuu′ + Nvv′\n(9.13)\nSince Nu and Nv belong to Tp(S), we may write\nNu\n= a11xu + a21xv\nNv\n= a12xu + a22xv\n(9.14)\nTherefore,\ndN =\nA\na11\na12\na21\na22\n!\nwith respect to basis {xu, xv}.\nOn the other hand, the expression of the second fundamental form in the\nbasis {xu, xv} is given by\nIIp(α′)\n= -⟨dN(α′), α′⟩\n= e(u′)2 + 2fu′v′ + g(v′)2\n(9.15)\nwhere, since ⟨N, xu⟩= ⟨N, xv⟩= 0\ne = -⟨Nu, xu⟩= ⟨N, xuu⟩,\n(9.16)\nf = -⟨Nv, xu⟩= ⟨N, xuv⟩= ⟨N, xvu⟩= -⟨Nu, xv⟩\n(9.17)\ng = -⟨Nv, xv⟩= ⟨N, xvv⟩\n(9.18)\n\nFrom eqns.

Compute H and K for sphere and plane.\nExample 6. Determine the asymptotic curves and the lines of curvature of\nthe helicoid x = v cos u, y = v sin u, z = cu and show that its mean curvature\nis zero.\n\nChapter 10\nIntroduction to Minimal\nSurfaces I\n10.1\nCalculating the Gauss Map using Coor-\ndinates\nLast time, we used the differential of the Gauss map to define several inter-\nesting features of a surface -- mean curvature H, Gauss curvature K, and\nprincipal curvatures k1 and k2. We did this using relatively general state-\nments. Now we will calculate these quantities in terms of the entries gij and\nbij of the two fundamental form matrices. (Note that do Carmo still uses\nE, F, G, and e, f, g here respectively.)\nDon't forget that the terms gij\nand bij(N) can be calculated with just a bunch of partial derivatives, dot\nproducts, and a wedge product -- the algebra might be messy but there's no\ncreativity required.\nLet dNp =\n\"\na11\na12\na21\na22\n#\nin terms of the basis { ∂x\n∂u, ∂x\n∂v} of Tp(S).\nNow,\n∂N\n∂u = a11\n∂x\n∂u + a21\n∂x\n∂v; so\n∂N\n∂u , ∂x\n∂u, =\n(r)\na11g11 + a21g12. But by a proof from last\ntime,\n∂N\n∂u , ∂x\n∂u, =\n(r)\n-\nD\nN, ∂2x\n∂u2, =\nE\n-b11(N). So -b11(N) = a11g11 + a21g12.\n\nThree more similar calculations will show us that\n-\n£\nbij(N)\n¤\n=\n£\naij\n¤£\ngij\n¤\nIf we recall that the Gaussian curvature K = k1k2 is the determinant\nof dNp =\n¡\naij\n¢\n, then we can see that det\n£\nbij(N)\n¤\n= K det\n£\ngij\n¤-1, so that\nK = b11(N)b22(N)-b12(N)2\ng11g22-g2\n.\nIf we solve the matrix equality for the matrix of aij, we get that\n£\naij\n¤\n=\ndet G\n\"\ng12b12(N) -g22b11(N)\ng12b22(N) -g22b12(N)\ng12b11(N) -g11b12(N)\ng12b12(N) -g11b22(N)\n#\nWe recall that -k1 and -k2 are the eigenvalues of dNp.\nThus, for\nsome nonzero vector vi, we have that dNp(vi) = -kivi = -kiIvi.\nThus\n\"\na11 + ki\na12\na21\na22 + ki\n#\nmaps some nonzero vector to zero, so its determinant\nmust be zero.\nThat is, k2\ni + ki(a11 + a22) + a11a22 -a21a12 = 0; both\nk1 and k2 are roots of this polynomial.\nNow, for any quadratic, the co-\nefficient of the linear term is the opposite of the sum of the roots.\nSo\nH =\n2(k1 + k2) = -1\n2(a11 + a22) =\nb11(N)g22-2b12(N)g12+b22(N)g11\ng11g22-g2\n. (This is\ngoing to be the Really Important Equation.)\nLast, we find the actual values k1 and k2. Remembering that the constant\nterm of a quadratic is the product of its roots and thus K, which we've already\ncalculated, we see that the quadratic we have is just k2\ni -2Hki +K = 0; this\nhas solutions ki = H ±\n√\nH2 -K.\nAs an exercise, calculate the mean curvature H of the helicoid x(uv) =\n(v cos u, v sin u, cu). (This was in fact a homework problem for today, but\nwork it out again anyway.)\n\n10.2\nMinimal Surfaces\nSince the bij(N) are defined as the dot product of N and something indepen-\ndent of N, they are each linear in N. So H(N) = 1\nb11(N)g22-2b12(N)g12+b22(N)g11\ng11g22-g2\nis also linear in N. We can actually consider mean curvature as a vector H\ninstead of as a function from N to a scalar, by finding the unique vector H\nsuch that H(N) = H · N. I'm pretty sure that this is more interesting when\nwe're embedded in something higher than R3.\nWe define a surface where H = 0 everywhere to be a minimal surface.\nMichael Nagle will explain this choice of name next time. You just calculated\nthat the helicoid is a minimal surface. So a surface is minimal iffg22b11(N)+\ng11b22(N) -2g12b12(N) = 0.\nAnother example of a minimal surface is the catenoid: x(u, v) = (cosh v cos u, cosh v sin u, v).\n(We've looked at this in at least one homework exercise.) We calculate ∂x\n∂u =\n(-cosh v sin u, cosh v cos u, 0) and ∂x\n∂v = (sinh v cos u, sinh v sin u, 1), so that\n£\ngij\n¤\n=\n\"\ncosh2 v\ncosh2 v\n#\n. Next, ∂x\n∂u∧∂x\n∂v = (cosh v cos u, cos v sin u, -cosh v sinh v),\nwith norm cosh2 v. So Np =\n¡ cos u\ncosh v, sin u\ncosh v, -tanh v\n¢\n.\nTaking the second partials, ∂2x\n∂u2 = (-cosh v cos u, -cosh v sin u, 0), ∂2x\n∂v2 =\n(cosh v cos u, cosh v sin u, 0), and\n∂2x\n∂u∂v = (-sinh v sin u, sinh v cos u, 0).\nSo\n£\nbij(N)\n¤\n=\n\"\n-1\n#\n. Finally, the numerator of H is g22b11(N) + g11b22(N) -\n2g12b12(N) = -cosh2 v + cosh2 v -0 = 0.\nSo the catenoid is a minimal\nsurface. In fact, it's the only surface of rotation that's a minimal surface.\n(Note: there are formulas in do Carmo for the second fundamental form of\na surface of rotation on page 161, but they assume that the rotating curve\nis parametrized by arc length, so they'll give the wrong answers for this\nparticular question.)\nWhy is it the only one? Say we have a curve y(x) = f(x) in the xy-plane\nLet S be the surface of rotation around the x-axis from this. We can show\nthat the lines of curvature of the surface are the circles in the yz-plane and\n\nthe lines of fixed θ. We can show that the first have curvature 1\ny\n(1+(y′)2)\n2 ,\nand the second have the same curvature as the graph y, which is\ny′′\n(1+(y′)2)\n2 .\nSo H is the sum of these:\n1+(y′)2-yy′′\n2y(1+(y′)2)\n2 . So this is 0 if 1 +\n¡ dy\nx\n¢2 -y d2y\ndx2 = 0.\nIf we let p =\ndy\ndx, then d2y\ndx2 =\ndp\ndx = dp\ndy\ndy\ndx = p dp\ndy. So our equation becomes\n1 + p2 -yp dp\ndy = 0, or\np\n1+p2dp =\nydy. Integrating, we get 1\n2 log(1 + p2) =\nlog y + C, so that y = C0\np\n1 + p2.\nThen p =\ndy\ndx =\np\ncy2 -1, so that\ndy\n√\ncy2-1 = dx. Integrating (if you knew this!), you get cosh-1 cy\nc\n= x+k, which\nis to say that y = c cosh x+l\nc . Whew!\n\nChapter 11\nIntroduction to Minimal\nSurface II\n11.1\nWhy a Minimal Surface is Minimal (or\nCritical)\nWe want to show why a regular surface im(x) = S with mean curvature\nH = 0 everywhere is called a minimal surface - i.e., that this is the surface\nof least area among all surfaces with the same boundary γ (and conversely,\nthat a surface that minimizes area (for a given boundary γ) has H = 0\neverywhere.) To do this we first use normal variations to derive a formula\nfor the change in area in terms of mean curvature, and then as an application\nof our formula we find that a surface has minimal area if and only if it has\nmean curvature 0.\nLet D be the domain on which x is defined, and let γ be a closed curve\nin D which bounds a subdomain △. (This is the notation used in Osserman,\np. 20 - 23.) We choose a differentiable function N(u) (here u = (u1, u2) is a\npoint in our domain D) normal to S at u, i.e.,\n\nN(u) · δx\nδui\n= 0.\n(11.1)\nDifferentiating yields\nδN\nδuj\n· δx\nδui\n= -N ·\nδ2\nδuiδuj\n= -bij(N).\n(11.2)\nNow let h(u) be an arbitrary C2 function in D, and for every real number\nλ let the surface Sλ be given by\nSλ : y(u) = x(u) + λh(u)N(u)\n(11.3)\ny is called a normal variation of x - since we are varying the surface\nx via the parameter λ along the direction of our normal N. Letting A(λ)\ndenote the area of the surface Sλ, we will show that:\nTheorem 11.1.1. A′(0) = -2\nR R\nS H(N)h(u)dA,\nwhere the integral of f with respect to surface area on S is defined as\nZ Z\nS\nf(u)dA =\nZ Z\n△\nf(u)\np\ndet gijdu1du2\n(11.4)\n(A′(0) denotes the derivative with respect to λ.)\nProof. Differentiating y with repsect to the domain coordinates ui, we get\nδy\nδui\n= δx\nδui\n+ λ(hδN\nδui\n+ δh\nδui\nN)\n(11.5)\nIf we let gλ\nij denote the entries of the first fundamental form for the surface\nSλ, we get\ngλ\nij = δy\nδui\n· δy\nδuj\n= gij -2λhbij(N) + λ2cij\n(11.6)\nwhere cij is a continuous function of u in D.\n\nThen we have\ndet(gλ\nij) = ao + a1λ + a2λ2\n(11.7)\nwith a0 = det gij, a1 = -2h(g11b22(N) + g22b11(N) -2g12b12(N)), and a2\nis a continuous function in u1, u2, and λ.\nBecause S is regular, and the determinant function is continuous, we\nknow that a0 has a positive minimum on cl(△) (the closure of △.) Then we\ncan find an o such that |λ| < o means that det(gλ\nij) > 0 on cl(△). Thus, for\na small enough o, all surfaces Sλ restricted to △are regular surfaces.\nNow, looking at the Taylor series expansion of the determinant function,\nwe get, for some positive constant M,\n|\nq\n(det(gλ\nij) -(√a0 +\na1\n2√a1\n)λ| < Mλ2\n(11.8)\nThen, using the formula for the area of a surface, we have that the area\nof our original surface S, A(0) =\nR R\n△\n√a0du1du2.\nIntegrating the equation with an M in it, we get\n|A(λ) -A(0) -λ\nZ Z\n△\na1\n2√a0\ndu1du2| < M1λ2\n(11.9)\n|A(λ) -A(0)\nλ\n-\nZ Z\n△\na1\n2√a0\ndu1du2| < M1λ.\n(11.10)\nLetting λ go to 0, and using H(N) = g22b11(N)+g11b22(N)-2g12b12(N)\n2 det(gij)\n, we get\nA′(0) = -2\nZ Z\n△\nH(N)h(u)\np\ndet gijdu1du2(∗)\n(11.11)\nor when integrating with respect to surface area\nA′(0) = -2\nZ Z\n△\nH(N)h(u)dA\n(11.12)\n\nFrom here it is clear that if H(N) is zero everywhere, then A′(0) is zero,\nand thus we have a critical point (hence minimal surfaces being misnamed:\nwe can only ensure that A has a critical point by setting H(N) to zero\neverywhere.) Now we show the converse:\nCorollary 11.1.2. If S minimizes area, then its mean curvature vanishes\neverywhere.\nProof. : Suppose the mean curvature doesn't vanish.\nThen there's some\npoint a and a normal N(a) where H(N) = 0 (we can assume H(N) > 0\nby choosing an appropriately oriented normal.) Then, with Lemma 2.2 from\nOsserman, we can find a neighborhood V1 of a where N is normal to S. This\nimplies that there's a smaller neighborhood V2 contained in V1 where the\nmean curvature H(N) is positive. Now choose a function h which is positive\non V2 and 0 elsewhere. Then the integral in (*) is strictly positive, and thus\nA′(0) is strictly negative.\nIf V2 is small enough (contained in △), then on the boundary γ, x(u) =\ny(u) for the original surface S and a surface Sλ respectively. Assuming that\nS minimizes area says that for all λ, A(λ) ≥A(0), which implies A′(0) = 0\nwhich is a contradiction since A′(0) was just shown to be strictly negative.\n11.2\nComplex Functions\nWorking in C is way different than working in just R2.\nFor example: a\ncomplex function of a complex variable (i.e., f : C →C) is called analytic if\nit is differentiable, and it can be shown that any analytic function is infinitely\ndifferentiable! It's pretty crazy.\nI don't think we're going to show that in this class, though. But let's talk\nabout derivatives of complex functions. They're defined in the same way as\nfor real functions, i.e. the derivative of a function f (with either a real or\ncomplex variable x) at a point a is\n\nlim\nx→a\nf(x) -f(a)\nx -a\n.\n(11.13)\nThese derivatives work like we expect them to (things like the product\nrule, quotient rule, and chain rule are still valid.) But, there is a fundamental\ndifference between considering a real variable and a complex variable.\nExercise 4. Let f(z) be a real function of a complex variable (f : C →R.)\nWhat can we say about f ′(a) for any point a?\n11.3\nAnalytic Functions and the Cauchy-Riemann\nEquations\nSo we defined earlier what an analytic function was, but I'll restate it here:\nDefinition 11.3.1. A function f : C →C is called analytic (or holomor-\nphic, equivalently) if its first derivative exists where f is defined.\nWe can also represent a complex function f by writing f(z) = u(z)+iv(z),\nwhere u and v are real-valued.\nWhen we look at the derivative of f at a :\nlim\nh→0\nf(a + h) -f(a)\nh\n(11.14)\nwe know that the limit as h approaches 0 must agree from all directions.\nSo if we look at f ′(a) as h approaches 0 along the real line (keeping the\nimaginary part of h constant), our derivative is a partial with respect to x\nand we get:\nf ′(z) = δf\nδx = δu\nδx + iδv\nδx\n(11.15)\nSimilarly, taking purely imaginary values for h, we get that\n\nf ′(z) = lim\nk→0\nf(z + ik) -f(z)\nk\n= -iδf\nδy = -iδu\nδy + δv\nδy\n(11.16)\nSo we get that\nδf\nδx = -iδf\nδy\n(11.17)\nand comparing real parts and imaginary parts,\nδu\nδx = δv\nδy, δu\nδy = -δv\nδx\n(11.18)\nThese are the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and any analytic function\nmust satisfy them.\n11.4\nHarmonic Functions\nWe assume that the functions u and v (given some analytic f = u + iv)\nhave continuous partial derivatives of all orders, and that the mixed partials\nare equal (this follows from knowing the derivative of an analytic function is\nitself analytic, as raved about earlier.) Then, using equality of mixed partials\nand the Cauchy-Riemann equations we can show that:\n∆u = δ2u\nδx2 + δ2u\nδy2 = 0\n(11.19)\nand\n∆v = δ2v\nδx2 + δ2v\nδy2 = 0\n(11.20)\nDefining any function f which satisfies Laplace's equation ∆f = 0 to be\nharmonic, we get that the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function\nare harmonic.\nConversely, say we have two harmonic funcions u and v, and that they\nsatisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations (here v is called the conjugate har-\n\nmonic function of u.) We want to show that f = u + iv is analytic. This\nis done in the next lecture (Kai's Monday 10/18 lecture!)\n\nChapter 12\nReview on Complex Analysis I\nReading: Alfors [1]:\n- Chapter 2, 2.4, 3.1-3.4\n- Chapter 3, 2.2, 2.3\n- Chapter 4, 3.2\n- Chapter 5, 1.2\n12.1\nCutoffFunction\nLast time we talked about cutofffunction. Here is the way to construct one\non Rn [5].\nProposition 12.1.1. Let A and B be two disjoint subsets in Rm, A compact\nand B closed. There exists a differentiable function φ which is identically 1\non A and identically 0 on B\nProof. We will complete the proof by constructing such a function.\n\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\nA plot of f(x) with a = 2 and b = 9\nLet 0 < a < b and define a function f : R →R by\nf(x) =\n(\nexp\n¡\nx-b -\nx-a\n¢\nif a < x < b\notherwise.\n)\n(12.1)\nIt is easy to check that f and the function\nF(x) =\nR b\nx f(t) dt\nR b\na f(t) dt\n(12.2)\nare differentiable. Note that the function F has value 1 for x ≤a and 0 for\nx ≥b. Thus, the function\nψ(x1, . . . , xm) = F(x2\n1 + . . . + x2\nm)\n(12.3)\nis differentiable and has values 1 for x2\n1+. . .+x2\nm ≤a and 0 for x2\n1+. . .+x2\nm ≥\nb.\nLet S and S′ be two concentric spheres in Rm, S′ ⊂S. By using ψ and\n\nlinear transformation, we can construct a differentiable function that has\nvalue 1 in the interior of S′ and value 0 outside S.\nNow, since A is compact, we can find finitely many spheres Si(1 ≤i ≤n)\nand the corresponding open balls Vi such that\nA ⊂\nn[\ni=1\nVi\n(12.4)\nand such that the closed balls Vi do not intersect B.\nWe can shrink each Si to a concentric sphere S′\ni such that the correspond-\ning open balls V ′\ni still form a covering of A. Let ψi be a differentiable function\non Rm which is identically 1 on B′\ni and identically 0 in the complement of\nV ′\ni , then the function\nφ = 1 -(1 -ψ1)(1 -ψ2) . . . (1 -ψn)\n(12.5)\nis the desired cutofffunction.\n12.2\nPower Series in Complex Plane\nIn this notes, z and ai's are complex numbers, i ∈Z.\nDefinition 12.2.1. Any series in the form\ninf\nX\nn=0\nan(z -z0)n = a0 +a1(z -z0)+a2(z -z0)2 +. . .+an(z -z0)n +. . . (12.6)\nis called power series.\nWithout loss of generality, we can take z0 to be 0.\nTheorem 12.2.2. For every power series 12.6 there exists a number R,\n0 ≤R ≤inf, called the radius of convergence, with the following properties:\n\n1. The series converges absolutely for every z with |z| < R. If 0 ≤ρ ≤R\nthe convergence is uniform for |z| ≤ρ.\n2. If |z| > R the terms of the series are unbounded, and the series is\nconsequently divergent.\n3. In |z| < R the sum of the series is an analytic function. The derivative\ncan be obtained by termwise differentiation, and the derived series has\nthe same radius of convergence.\nProof. The assertions in the theorem is true if we choose R according to the\nHadamard's formula\nR = lim sup\nn→inf\nnp\n|an|.\n(12.7)\nThe proof of the above formula, along with assertion (1) and (2), can be\nfound in page 39 of Alfors.\nFor assertion (3), first I will prove that the derived series Pinf\n1 nanzn-1\nhas the same radius of convergence. It suffices to show that\nlim\nn→inf\nn√n = 1\n(12.8)\nLet\nn√n = 1 + δn. We want to show that limn→infδn = 0. By the binomial\ntheorem,\nn = (1 + δn)n > 1 + 1\n2n(n -1)δ2\nn\n(12.9)\nwhich gives\nδ2\nn < 2\nn\n(12.10)\nand thus\nlim\nn→infδn = 0\n(12.11)\nLet us write\nf(z) =\ninf\nX\nanzn = sn(z) + Rn(z)\n(12.12)\n\nwhere\nsn(z) = a0 + a1z + . . . + an-1zn-1\n(12.13)\nis the partial sum of the series, and\nRn(z) =\ninf\nX\nk=n\nakzk\n(12.14)\nis the remainder of the series. Also let\nf1(z) =\ninf\nX\nnanzn-1 = lim\nn→infs′\nn(z).\n(12.15)\nIf we can show that f ′(z) = f1(z), then we can prove that the sum of the\nseries is an analytic function, and the derivative can be obtained by termwise\ndifferentiation.\nConsider the identity\nf(z) -f(z0)\nz -z0\n-f1(z0) =\nμsn(z) -sn(z0)\nz -z0\n-s′\nn(z0)\n¶\n+(s′\nn(z0)-f1(z0))+\nμRn(z) -Rn(z0)\nz -z0\n¶\n(12.16)\nand assume z = z0 and |z|, |z0| < ρ < R. The last term can be rewritten as\ninf\nX\nk=n\nak(zk-1 + zk-2z0 + . . . + zzk-2\no\n) = zk-1\n,\n(12.17)\nand thus\n\nRn(z) -Rn(z0)\nz -z0\n≤\ninf\nX\nk=n\nk|ak|ρk-1\n(12.18)\nSince the left hand side of the inequality is a convergent sequence, we can\nfind n0 such that for n ≥n0,\n\nRn(z) -Rn(z0)\nz -z0\n< o\n3.\n(12.19)\n\nFrom Eq. 12.15, we know that there is also an n1 such that for n ≥n1,\n|s′\nn(z0) -f1(z0)| < o\n3.\n(12.20)\nNow if we choose n ≥n0, n1, from the definition of derivative we can find\nδ > 0 such that 0 < |z -z0| < δ implies\n\nsn(z) -sn(z0)\nz -z0\n-s′\nn(z0)\n< o\n3.\n(12.21)\nCombining Eq. 12.19, 12.20 and 12.21, we have for 0 < |z -z0| < δ\n\nf(z) -f(z0)\nz -z0\n-f1(z0)\n< o\n(12.22)\nThus, we have proved that f ′(z0) exists and equals f1(z0).\n12.3\nTaylor Series\nNote that we have proved that a power series with positive radius of conver-\ngence has derivatives of all orders. Explicitly,\nf(z) = a0 + a1z + a2z2 + . . .\n(12.23)\nf ′(z) = z1 + 2a2z + 3a3z2 + . . .\n(12.24)\nf ′′(z) = 2a2 + 6a3z + 12a4z2 + . . .\n(12.25)\n...\n(12.26)\nf (k)(z) = k!ak + (k + 1)!\n1!\nak+1z + (k + 2)!\n2!\nak+2z2 + . . .\n(12.27)\nSince ak = f (k)(0)/k!, we have the Taylor-Maclaurin series:\nf(z) = f(0) + f ′(0)z + f ′′(0)\n2!\nz2 + . . . + f (n)(0)\nn!\nzn + . . .\n(12.28)\n\nNote that we have proved this only under the assumption that f(z) has a\npower series development. We did not prove that every analytic function has\na Taylor development, but this is what we are going to state without proof.\nThe proof can be found in Chapter 4, Sec. 3.1 of [1].\nTheorem 12.3.1. If f(z) is analytic in the region Ω, containing z0, then\nthe representation\nf(z) = f(z0) + f ′(z0)(z -z0) + f ′′(z0)\n2!\n(z -z0)2 + . . . + f (n)(z0)\nn!\n(z -z0)n + . . .\n(12.29)\nis valid in the largest open disk of center z0 contained in Ω.\n12.3.1\nThe Exponential Functions\nWe define the exponential function as the solution to the following differential\nequation:\nf ′(z) = f(z)\n(12.30)\nwith the initial value f(0) = 1. The solution is denoted by ez and is given by\nez = 1 + z\n1! + z2\n2! + . . . + zn\nn! + . . .\n(12.31)\nSince R = lim supn→inf\nn√\nn!, we can prove that the above series converges if\nlim\nn→inf\nn√\nn! = inf\n(12.32)\nProposition 12.3.2.\nea+b = eaeb\n(12.33)\nProof. Since D(ez ·ec-z) = ez ·ec-z +ez ·(-ec-z) = 0, we know that ez ·ec-z is\na constant. The value can be found by putting z = 0, and thus ez ·ec-z = ec.\nPutting z = a and c = a + b, we have the desired result.\nCorollary 12.3.3. ez · e-z = 1, and thus ez is never 0.\n\nMoreover, if z = x + iy, we have\n|eiy|2 = eiye-iy = 1\n(12.34)\nand\n|ex+iy| = |ex|.\n(12.35)\n12.3.2\nThe Trigonometric Functions\nWe define\ncos z = eiz + e-iz\n,\nsin z = eiz -e-iz\n2i\n(12.36)\nIn other words,\ncos z = 1 -z2\n2! + z4\n4! + . . . ,\n(12.37)\nsin z = z -z3\n3! + z5\n5! + . . . .\n(12.38)\nFrom Eq. 12.36, we can obtain the Euler's equation,\neiz = cos z + i sin z\n(12.39)\nand\ncos2 z + sin2 z = 1\n(12.40)\nFrom Eq. 12.39, we can directly find\nD cos z = -sin z,\nD sin z = cos z\n(12.41)\nand the additions formulas\ncos(a + b) = cos a cos b -sin a sin b\n(12.42)\nsin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b\n(12.43)\n\n12.3.3\nThe Logarithm\nThe logarithm function is the inverse of the exponential function. Therefore,\nz = log w is a root of the equation ez = w. Since ez is never 0, we know\nthat the number 0 has no logarithm. For w = 0 the equation ex+iy = w is\nequivalent to\nex = |w|,\neiy = w\n|w|\n(12.44)\nThe first equation has a unique solution x = log|w|, the real logarithm of |w|.\nThe second equation is a complex number of absolute value 1. Therefore,\none of the solution is in the interval 0 ≤y < 2π. Also, all y that differ from\nthis solution by an integral multiple of 2π satisfy the equation. Therefore,\nevery complex number other that 0 has infinitely many logarithms which\ndiffer from each other by multiples of 2πi.\nIf we denote arg w to be the imaginary part of log w, then it is interpreted\nas the angle, measured in radians, between the positive real axis and the half\nline from 0 through the point w. And thus we can write\nlog w = log |w| + i arg w\n(12.45)\nThe addition formulas of the exponential function implies that\nlog(z1z2) = log z1 + log z2\n(12.46)\narg(z1z2) = arg z1 + arg z2\n(12.47)\n12.4\nAnalytic Functions in Regions\nDefinition 12.4.1. A function f(z) is analytic on an arbitrary point set A\nif it is the restriction to A of a function which is analytic in some open set\ncontaining A.\nAlthough the definition of analytic functions requires them to be single-\n\nvalued, we can choose a definite region such that a multiple-valued function,\nsuch as z1/2, is single-valued and analytic when restricted to the region. For\nexample, for the function f(z) = z1/2, we can choose the region Ωto be the\ncomplement of the negative real axis. With this choice of Ω, one and only one\nof the values of z1/2 has a positive real part, and thus f(z) is a single-valued\nfunction in Ω. The proof of continuity and differentiability of f(z) is in [1]\nand thus omitted.\n12.5\nConformal Mapping\nLet γ be an arc with equation z = z(t), t ∈[-o, o] contained in region Ω\nwith z(0) = p. Let f(z) be a continuous function on Ω. The equation\nw = w(t) = f(z(t)) defines an arc β in the w-plane which we call it the image\nof γ.\n-ε\nε\nt\nγ\nf\n(p)\n'(0)\nw\nβ\n(w)\n(w)\nf\n(z)\n(z)\np\nz '(0)\nRe\nIm\nw\nΩ\nz\nRe\nIm\n-plane\n-plane\nWe can find w′(0) by\nw′(0) = f ′(p)z′(0).\n(12.48)\n\nThe above equation implies that\narg w′(0) = arg f ′(p) + arg z′(0).\n(12.49)\nIn words, it means that the angle between the directed tangents to γ at p and\nto β and f(p) is equal to arg f ′(p), and thus independent of γ. Consequently,\ncurves through p which are tangent to each other are mapped onto curves\nwith a common tangent at f(p). Moreover, two curves which form an angle\nat p are mapped upon curves forming the same angle. In view of this, we\ncall the mapping f to be conformal at all points with f ′(z) = 0.\n12.6\nZeros of Analytic Function\nThe goal of this section is to show that the zeros of analytic functions are\nisolated.\nProposition 12.6.1. If f is an analytic function on a region Ωand it does\nnot vanish identically in Ω, then the zeros of f are isolated.\nProof. Remember that we have assumed in 12.3 that every function f that\nis analytic in the region Ωcan be written as\nf(z) = f(z0) + f ′(z0)(z -z0) + f ′′(z0)\n2!\n(z -z0)2 + . . . + f (n)(z0)\nn!\n(z -z0)n + . . .\n(12.50)\nLet E1 be the set on which f(z) and all derivatives vanish at z0 ∈C and\nE2 the set on which the function or one of the derivatives evaluated at z0 is\ndifferent from zero. When f(z) and all derivatives vanish at z0, then f(z) = 0\ninside the whole region Ω. Thus, E1 is open. E2 is open because the function\nand all derivatives are continuous. Since Ωis connected, we know that either\nE1 or E2 has to be empty. If E2 is empty, then the function is identically\nzero. If E1 is empty, f(z) can never vanish together with all its derivatives.\n\nAssume now that f(z) is not identically zero, and f(z0) = 0. Then there\nexists a first derivative f (h)(z0) that is not zero. We say that a is a zero of f\nof order h. Moreover, it is possible to write\nf(z) = (z -z0)hfh(z)\n(12.51)\nwhere fh(z) is analytic and fh(z0) = 0.\nSince fh(z) is continuous, fh(z) = 0 in the neighbourhood of z0 and z = z0\nis the unique zero of f(z) in the neighborhood of z0.\nCorollary 12.6.2. If f(z) and g(z) are analytic in Ω, and if f(z) = g(z) on\na set which has an accumulation point in Ω, then f(z) is identically equal to\ng(z).\nProof. Consider the difference f(z) -g(z) and the result from Proposi-\ntion 12.6.1.\n\nChapter 13\nReview on Complex Analysis II\n(This lecture was given Friday, October 22, 2004.)\n13.1\nPoles and Singularities\n(Following Ahlfors pages 127 - 129.)\nWe consider a function f(z) analytic in a neighborhood of a, except per-\nhaps at a itself. (So f(z) is analytic on a region 0 < |z -a| < δ.)\nDefinition 13.1.1. The number a, as above, is called an isolated singularity\nof f.\nWe call a a removable singularity if we can simply define f(a) appropri-\nately so that f(z) becomes analytic in the entire disk |z -a| < δ. This is\ndiscussed in Ahlfors, page 124.\nDefinition 13.1.2. If limz→a f(z) = inf, a is a pole of f(z).\nWith the case of a pole, we set f(a) = inf. Then there exists a δ′ ≤δ\nsuch that f(z) = 0 on 0 < |z -a| < δ′. On this disk, we can look at\ng(z) = 1/f(z), which is analytic on this disk, and more importantly has a\nremovable singularity at a. So we can set g(a) = 0.\n\nNow g(z) doesn't vanish identically, so we know that the zero of g at a\nhas finite order and we can write g(z) = (z -a)hgh(z) , where gh(z) = 0 and\nis analytic (we can do this because an analytic function behaves locally like a\npolynomial. Since our function isn't identically zero, we can find a derivative\ng(h)(a) that doesn't vanish, and then look at the Taylor series expansion\nfrom that term on, factoring out (z -a)h from each term. See Kai's previous\nnotes, Eq.\n60.)\nWe call h the order of the pole, and we can now write\nf(z) = (z -a)-hfh(z), where fh(z) = 1/gh(z) is analytic and non-zero in a\nneighborhood of a.\nDefinition 13.1.3. : A function f(z) analytic in a region Ω, except for at\nits poles, is called meromorphic in Ω.\nEquivalently, for every a ∈Ω, there is either a neighborhood |z -a| < δ\nwhere the function is analytic, or else f(z) is analytic on 0 < |z -a| < δ and\nthe isolated singularity there is a pole. So that means that the poles of a\nmeromorphic function are isolated by definition. (What would happen if the\npoles weren't isolated?)\nLooking at the quotient f(z)/g(z) of two analytic functions in Ω, and\nassuming that g(z) isn't identically zero, we get a meromorphic function in Ω.\nThe possible poles here are the zeroes of g(z), but a common zero of f(z) and\ng(z) could be a removable singularity (f(z) = (z2 -1)/(z + 1), for example.)\nSimilarly, the sum, product, and quotient of meromorphic functions are again\nmeromorphic. When regarding the quotient of meromorphic functions, we\nexclude the possibility of the denominator being identically zero (otherwise,\nwe'd have to consider f(z) = infto be a meromorphic function.)\nLet's now take a deeper look at isolated singularities. Consider the con-\nditions\nlim\nz→a |z -a|α|f(z)| = 0\n(13.1)\nlim\nz→a |z -a|α|f(z)| = inf\n(13.2)\n\nwhere α is a real number. If (1) holds for a given value of α, then it holds\nfor all larger values of α, and thus we can find some integer m where it is\ntrue. This means that g(z) = (z -a)mf(z) has a removable singularity and\nvanishes on a. From here, we know that either f(z) is identically zero (and\nthen (1) holds for all α), or g(z) = (z -a)mf(z) has a zero of finite order\nk. In the latter case, we can write g(z) = (z -a)k(z -a)m-kf(z), where\n(z -a)m-kf(z) is analytic. So if α > h = m -k, (1) holds, and if α < h (2)\nholds.\nNow we assume that condition (2) holds for some α. Then it holds for all\nsmaller α, and likewise for some integer n. The function g(z) = (z -a)nf(z)\nhas a pole of finite order l, and setting h = n + l (since now we write\ng(z) = (z -a)-l(z -a)l+nf(z), where (z -a)l+nf(z) is analytic) we find that\ncondition (1) holds when α > h and condition (2) holds when α < h.\nThis means that given an isolated singularity, we have three cases to\nexamine:\ni) f(z) is identically zero\nii) there exists an integer h such that (1) holds for h > α and (2) holds\nfor h < α\niii) neither (1) nor (2) holds for any α.\nCase i) is not interesting.\nWith case ii), we call h the algebraic order of f(z) at a. For a pole this\nis positive, for a zero it is negative, and it is zero when f(z) is analytic but\nnot equal to zero at a. The algebraic order is always an integer - there is no\nsingle-valued analytic function which tends to 0 or inflike a fractional power\nof |z -a|\nFor case iii), a is called an essential isolated singularity. So in any neigh-\nborhood of an essential isolated singularity, f(z) is both unbounded and\ncomes arbitrarily close to zero. This is illustrated by:\nTheorem 13.1.4 (Weierstrass). An analytic function comes arbritrarily\nclose to any complex value in every neighborhood of an essential singularity.\n\nProof. : Suppose that isn't true. Then we can find a complex number A and\na δ > 0 such that |f(z) -A| > δ in a neighborhood of a (except at z = a.)\nFor any α < 0 we then have limz→a |z -a|α|f(z) -A| = inf. So a would not\nbe an essential singularity of f(z) -A.\nThen we can find a β where limz→a |z -a|β|f(z) -A| = 0 (since we're\nnow looking at a case ii) singularity) and we're free to choose β > 0. Then\nsince in that case limz→a |z-a|β = 0, it follows that limz→a |z-a|β|f(z)| = 0,\ncontradicting the fact that a is an essential singularity of f(z).\n\nChapter 14\nIsotherman Parameters\nLet x : U →S be a regular surface. Let\nφk(z) = ∂xk\n∂u1\n-i∂xk\n∂u2\n, z = u1 + iu2.\n(14.1)\nRecall from last lecture that\na)φ is analytic in z ⇔xk is harmonic in u1 and u2.\nb)u1 and u2 are isothermal parameters ⇔\nn\nX\nk=1\nφ2\nk(z) = 0\n(14.2)\nc) If u1, u2 are isothermal parameters, then S is regular ⇔\nn\nX\nk=1\n|φk(z)|2 = 0\n(14.3)\nWe start by stating a lemma that summarizes what we did in the last lecture:\nLemma 4.3 in Osserman: Let x(u) define a minimal surface, with\nu1, u2 isothermal parameters.\nThen the functions φk(z) are analytic and\nthey satisfy the eqns in b) and c). Conversely if φ1, φ2, .., φn are analytic\nfunctions satisfying the eqns in b) and c) in a simply connected domain D\n\nthen there exists a regular minimal surface defined over domain D, such that\nthe eqn on the top of the page is valid.\nNow we take a surface in non-parametric form:\nxk = fk(x1, x2), k = 3, ..., n\n(14.4)\nand we have the notation from the last time:\nf = (f3, f4, ..., fn), p = ∂f\n∂x1\n, q = ∂f\n∂x2\n, r = ∂2f\n∂x2\n, s =\n∂2f\n∂x1∂x2\n, t = ∂2f\n∂x2\n(14.5)\nThen the minimal surface eqn may be written as:\n(1 + |q|2) ∂p\n∂x1\n-(p.q)( ∂p\n∂x2\n+ ∂q\n∂x1\n) + (1 + |p|2) ∂q\n∂x2\n= 0\n(14.6)\nequivalently\n(1 + |q|2)r -2(p.q)s + (1 + |p|2)t = 0\n(14.7)\nOne also has the following:\ndetgij = 1 + |p|2 + |q|2 + |p|2|q|2 -(p.q)2\n(14.8)\nDefine\nW =\np\ndetgij\n(14.9)\nBelow we'll do exactly the same things with what we did when we showed\nthat the mean curvature equals 0 if the surface is minimizer for some curve.\nNow we make a variation in our surface just like the one that we did before\n(the only difference is that x1 and x2 are not varied.)\nfk = fk + λhk, k = 3, ..., n,\n(14.10)\nwhere λ is a real number, and hk ∈C1 in the domain of definition D of the\n\nfk We have\nf = f + λh, p = p + λ ∂h\n∂x1\n, q = q + λ ∂h\n∂x2\n(14.11)\nOne has\nW 2 = W 2 + 2λX + λ2Y\n(14.12)\nwhere\nX = [(1 + |q|2)p -(p.q)q]. ∂h\n∂x1\n+ [(1 + |p|2)q -(p.q)p]. ∂h\n∂x2\n(14.13)\nand Y is a continuous function in x1 and x2. It follows that\nW = W + λ X\nW + O(λ2)\n(14.14)\nas |λ| →0 Now we consider a closed curve Γ on our surface. Let ∆be the\nregion bounded by Γ If our surface is a minimizer for ∆then for every choice\nof h such that h = 0 on Γ we have\nZ Z\n∆\nWdx1dx2 ≥\nZ Z\n∆\nWdx1dx2\n(14.15)\nwhich implies\nZ Z\n∆\nX\nW = 0\n(14.16)\nSubstituting for X, integrating by parts, and using the fact that h = 0 on Γ\n, we find\nZ Z\n∆\n· ∂\n∂x1\n·1 + |q|2\nW\np -p.q\nW q\n\n+ ∂\n∂x2\n·1 + |p|2\nW\nq -p.q\nW p\n\nhdx1dx2 = 0\n(14.17)\nmust hold everywhere. By the same reasoning that we used when we found\nthe condition for a minimal surface the above integrand should be zero.\n∂\n∂x1\n·1 + |q|2\nW\np -p.q\nW q\n\n+ ∂\n∂x2\n·1 + |p|2\nW\nq -p.q\nW p\n\n= 0\n(14.18)\n\nOnce we found this equation it makes sense to look for ways to derive it\nfrom the original equation since after all there should only be one constraint\nfor a minimal surface. In fact the LHS of the above eqn can be written as\nthe sum of three terms:\n·1 + |q|2\nW\n∂p\n∂x1\n-p.q\nW ( ∂q\n∂x1\n+ ∂p\n∂x2\n) + 1 + |p|2\nW\n∂q\n∂x2\n\n(14.19)\n+\n· ∂\n∂x1\n(1 + |q|2\nW\n) -∂\n∂x2\n(p.q\nW )\n\np\n(14.20)\n+\n· ∂\n∂x2\n(1 + |p|2\nW\n) -∂\n∂x1\n(p.q\nW )\n\nq\n(14.21)\nThe first term is the minimal surface eqn given on the top of the second\npage. If we expand out the coefficient of p in the second term we find the\nexpression:\nW 3[(p.q)q -(1 + |q|2)p].[(1 + |q|2)r -2(p.q)s + (1 + |p|2)t]\n(14.22)\nwhich vanishes by the second version of the minimal surface eqns. Similarly\nthe coefficient of q in third term vanishes so the while expression equals zero.\nIn the process we've also shown that\n∂\n∂x1\nμ1 + |q|2\nW\n¶\n=\n∂\n∂x2\n3p.q\nW\n\n(14.23)\n∂\n∂x2\nμ1 + |p|2\nW\n¶\n=\n∂\n∂x1\n3p.q\nW\n\n(14.24)\nExistence of isothermal parameters or Lemma 4.4 in Osserman\nLet S be a minimal surface. Every regular point of S has a neighborhood in\nwhich there exists a reparametrization of S in terms of isothermal parameters.\nProof: Since the surface is regular for any point there exists a neighbor-\nhood of that point in which S may be represented in non-parametric form.\nIn particular we can find a disk around that point where the surface can be\n\nrepresented in non parametric form. Now the above eqns imply the existence\nof functions F(x1, x2) G(x1, x2) defined on this disk, satisfying\n∂F\n∂x1\n= 1 + |p|2\nW\n, ∂F\n∂x2\n= p.q\nW ;\n(14.25)\n∂G\n∂x1\n= p.q\nW , ∂G\n∂x2\n= 1 + |q|2\nW\n(14.26)\nIf we set\nξ1 = x1 + F(x1, x2), ξ2 = x2 + G(x1, x2),\n(14.27)\nwe find\nJ = ∂(x1, x2)\n∂(x1, x2) = 2 + 2 + |p|2 + |q|2\nW\n≥0\n(14.28)\nThus the transformation (x1, x2) →(ξ1, ξ2) has a local inverse (ξ1, ξ2) →\n(x1, x2). We find the derivative of x at point (ξ1, ξ2):\nDx = J-1[x1, x2, f3, ..., fn]\n(14.29)\nIt follows that with respect to the parameters ξ1, ξ2 we have\ng11 = g22 = | ∂x\n∂ξ1\n|2 = | ∂x\n∂ξ2\n|2\n(14.30)\ng12 = ∂x\n∂ξ1\n. ∂x\n∂ξ2\n= 0\n(14.31)\nso that ξ1, ξ2 are isothermal coordinates.\n\nChapter 15\nBernstein's Theorem\n15.1\nMinimal Surfaces and isothermal parametriza-\ntions\nNote: This section will not be gone over in class, but it will be referred to.\nLemma 15.1.1 (Osserman 4.4). Let S be a minimal surface. Every regular\npoint p of S has a neighborhood in which there exists of reparametrization of\nS in terms of isothermal parameters.\nProof. By a previous theorem (not discussed in class) there exists a neighbor-\nhood of the regular point which may be represented in a non-parametric form.\nThen we have that x(x1, x2) = (x1, x2, f3(x1, x2), . . . , fn(x1, x2)). Defining\nf = (f3, f4, . . . , fn), we let p =\n∂f\n∂x1, q =\n∂f\n∂x2, r = ∂2f\n∂x2\n1, s =\n∂2f\n∂x1∂x2, and t = ∂tf\n∂x2\n2.\nLast, we let W =\np\ndet gij =\np\n1 + |p|2 + |q|2 + |p|2|q|2 -(p · q)2. We then\nhave (from last lecture)\n∂\n∂x1\nμ1 + |q|2\nW\n¶\n=\n∂\n∂x2\n3p · q\nW\n\n∂\n∂x1\n3p · q\nW\n\n=\n∂\n∂x2\nμ1 + |q|2\nW\n¶\n\nThen there exists a function F(x1, x2) such that ∂F\n∂x1 = 1+|p|2\nW\nand ∂F\n∂x2 = p·q\nW .\nWhy? Think back to 18.02 and let V = (1+|p|2\nW\n, p·q\nW , 0) be a vector field in R3;\nthen | ▽×V | =\n∂\n∂x2\n1+|p|2\nW\n-\n∂\n∂x1\np·q\nW = 0, so there exists a function F such that\n▽F = V , which is the exact condition we wanted (once we get rid of the\nthird dimension). Similarly there exists a function G(x1, x2) with\n∂G\n∂x1 = p·q\nW\nand ∂G\n∂x2 = ∂1+|q|2\n∂W\n.\nWe now define ξ(x1, x2)(x1 +F(x1, x2), x2 +G(x1, x2)). We then find that\n∂ξ1\n∂x1 = 1 + 1+|p|2\nW\n, ∂ξ2\n∂x2 = 1 + 1+|q|2\nW\n, and ∂ξ1\n∂x2 = ∂ξ2\n∂x1 = p·q\nW . Then (recalling the\ndefintion of W 2) we can find that the magnitude of the Jacobian ∂(ξ1,ξ2)\n∂(x1,x) is\n2+ 2+|p|2+|q|2\nW\n> 0. This implies that the transformation ξ has a local inverse ˆx\nat p. Judicial use of the inverse function theorem will show that with respect\nto the parameters ξ1 and ξ2, g11 = g22 and g12 = 0, so these are isothermal\ncoordinates; see Osserman p 32 for details.\nWe also have the following result:\nLemma 15.1.2 (Osserman 4.5). Let a surface S be defined by an isother-\nmal parametrization x(u), and let eS be a reparametrization of S defined by\na diffeomorphism with matrix U. Then u1, u2 are isothermal parameters if\nand only if the map U is either conformal or anti-conformal.\nProof. For a map to be conformal or anti-conformal means that it preserves\n|θ|, or alternatively that it preserves cos θ. (It also needs to be continuous\nenough that it isn't flipping the sign back and forth.) If U is a constant\nμ times an orthogonal matrix, then μ|v| = |Uv| for all v since μ2 ⟨v, v⟩=\n⟨Uv, Uv⟩; thus if θ is the angle between vectors v and w and θ′ is the angle\nbetween Uv and Uw, we have that cos θ =\nμ2⟨v,w⟩\nμ2|v||w| =\n⟨Uv,Uw⟩\n|Uv||Uw| = cos θ′. So\nfor diffeomorphisms with matrix U, U being conformal or anti-conformal is\nequivalent to U being a constant multiple of an orthogonal matrix.\nNow, since x is isothermal, we have that gij = λ2δij (where δij is the\nKronecker delta). By a theorem on page 5 about change of coordinates, we\nknow that eG = U TGU = λ2U TU. So u1, u2 is isothermal iff gij = λ2δij,\n\nwhich is to say that I =\nλ2\nλ2U TU, which is to say that\nλ\nλU is orthogonal.\nBut we have already shown that this is equivalent to U being conformal or\nanti-conformal.\n15.2\nBernstein's Theorem: Some Preliminary\nLemmas\nThe main goal of today is to prove Bernstein's Theorem, which has the\nnice corollary that in R3, the only minimal surface that is defined in non-\nparametric form on the entire x1, x2 plane is a plane. This makes sense: the\ncatenoid and helicoid are not going to give you nonparametric forms since no\nprojection of them is injective, and Scherk's surface may be nonparametric\nbut it's only defined on a checkerboard. We have a bunch of lemmas to work\nthrough first.\nLemma 15.2.1 (Osserman 5.1). Let E : D →R be a C2 function on a\nconvex domain D, and suppose that the Hessian matrix\n∂2E\n∂xi∂xj\n\nevaluated at\nany point is positive definite. (This means that the quadratic form it defines\nsends every nonzero vector to a positive number, or equivalently that it is\nsymmetric with positive eigenvalues.) Define a mapping φ: D →R2 with\nφ(x1, x2) = ( ∂E\n∂x1(x1, x2), ∂E\n∂x2(x1, x2)) (since\n∂E\n∂x1 : D →R). Let a and b be\ndistinct points of D; then (b -a) · (φ(b) -φ(a)) > 0.\nProof. Let G(t) = E(tb + (1 -t)a) = E(tb1 + (1 -t)a1, tb2 + (1 -t)b2) for\nt ∈[0, 1]. Then\nG′(t) =\nX\ni=1\nμ∂E\n∂xi\n(tb + (1 -t)a)\n¶\n(bi -ai)\n(note that the tb + (1 -t)a here is the argument of\n∂E\n∂xi, not a multiplied\n\nfactor) and\nG′′(t) =\nX\ni,j=1\nμ\n∂2\n∂xi∂xj\n(tb + (1 -t)a)\n¶\n(bi -ai)(bj -aj)\nBut this is just the quadratic form of\n∂2E\n∂xi∂xj\n\nevaluated at the point tb +\n(1 -t)a, applied to the nonzero vector b -a. By positive definiteness, we\nhave that G′′(t) > 0 for t ∈[0, 1]. So G′(1) > G′(0), which is to say that\nP φ(b)i(bi-ai) > P φ(a)i(bi-ai), which is to say that (φ(b)-φ(a))·(b-a) >\n0.\nLemma 15.2.2 (Osserman 5.2). Assume the hypotheses of Osserman\nLemma 5.1. Define the map z : D →R2 by zi(x1, x2) = xi + φi(x1, x2). Then\ngiven distinct points a, b ∈D, we have that (z(b) -z(a)) · (b -a) > |b -a|2,\nand |z(b) -z(a)| > |b -a|.\nProof. Since z(b)-z(a) = (b-a)+(φ(b)-φ(a)), we have that (z(b)-z(a))·\n(b -a) = |b -a|2 + (φ(b) -φ(a)) · (b -a) > |b -a|2 by the previous lemma.\nThen |b -a|2 < |(z(b) -z(a)) · (b -a)| ≤|z(b) -z(a)||b -a|, where the\nsecond inequality holds by Cauchy-Schwarz; so |b -a| < |z(b) -z(a)|.\nLemma 15.2.3 (Osserman 5.3). Assume the hypotheses of Osserman\nLemma 5.2.\nIf D is the disk x2\n1 + x2\n2 < R2, then the map z is a diffeo-\nmorphism of D onto a domain ∆which includes a disk of radius R around\nz(0).\nProof. We know that z is continuously differentiable, since E ∈C2. If x(t) is\nany differentiable curve in D and z(t) is its image under z, then it follows from\nthe previous lemma that |z′(t)| > |x′(t)|; thus the determina t of the matrix dz\n(which is to say, the Jacobian) is greater than 1, since z′(t) = (dz)x′(t) implies\nthat |z′(t)| = det dz|x′(t)|. So since the Jacobian is everywhere greater than\n1, the map is a local diffeomorphism everywhere. It's also injective (because\nn\n\nφ(b) -φ(a) = 0 implies that b -a = 0 by the previous lemma), so it's in fact\na (global) diffeomorphism onto a domain ∆.\nWe must show that ∆includes all points z such that z -z(0) < R. If\n∆is the whole plane this is obvious; otherwise there is a point Z in the\ncomplement of ∆(which is closed) which minimizes the distance to z(0).\nLet Zk be a sequence of points in R2 -∆which approach Z (if this didn't\nexist, we could find a point in R2 -∆closer to z(0) than Z), and since z is\na diffeomorphism, we let xk be the sequence of points mapped onto Zk by z.\nThe points xk cannot have a point of accumulation in D, since that would\nbe mapped by z onto a point of ∆, and we are assuming that Z ∈∆. But\nxk must have an accumulation point in R2 in order for their image to; so\n|xk| →R as k →inf; since |Zk -z(0)| > |xk -0| by the previous lemma, we\nhave that |Z -z(0)| ≥R, so every point within R of z(0) is in ∆.\nLemma 15.2.4 (Osserman 5.4). Let f(x1, x2) be a non-parametric solution\nto the minimal surface equation in the disk of radius R around the origin.\nThen the map ξ defined earlier is a diffeomorphism onto a domain ∆which\nincludes a disk of radius R around ξ(0).\nProof. It follows from the defining characteristics of F and G that there exists\na function E satisfying ∂E\n∂x1 = F and ∂E\n∂x2 = G, for the same reason that F and\nG exist. Then E ∈C2, and ∂2E\n∂x2\n1 = 1+|p|2\nW\n> 0, and det\n∂2E\n∂xi∂xj =\n∂(F,G)\n∂(x1,x2) = 1 > 0\n(by the definition of W, it's a simple check). Any matrix\nA\na\nb\nb\nc\n!\nwith a > 0\nand ac -b2 > 0 must have c > 0, so its trace and determinant are both\npositive, so the sum and product of its eigenvalues are both positive, so it is\npositive definite. So the Hessian of E is positive definite. We can see that\nthe mapping z defined in (our version of) Osserman Lemma 5.2 is in this\ncase the same map as ξ defined in (our version of) Osserman Lemma 4.4. So\nby Osserman Lemma 5.3, we have that ξ is a diffeomorphism onto a domain\n∆which includes a disk of radius R around ξ(0).\n\nLemma 15.2.5 (Osserman 5.5). Let f : D →R be a C1 function. Then\nthe surface S in R3 defined in non-parametric form by x3 = f(x1, f2) lies on\na plane iffthere exists a nonsingular linear transformation ψ: U →D from\nsome domain U such that u1, u2 are isothermal parameters on S.\nProof. Suppose such parameters u1, u2 exist. Letting φk(ζ) = ∂xk\n∂u1 -i ∂xk\n∂u2 , for\n1 ≤k ≤3, we see that φ1 and φ2 are constant because x1 and x2 are linear\nin u1 and u2. We know from a previous lecture that u1 and u2 are isothermal\nparameters iffP3\nk=1 φ2\nk(ζ) is zero for all ζ, so φ3 is constant too. (Well, it\nimplies that φ2\n3 is constant, which constrains it to at most two values, and\nsince φ3 must be continuous, it must be constant.) This means that x3 has\na constant gradient with respect to u1, u2 and thus also with respect to x1,\nx2. This means that we must have f(x1, x2) = Ax1 + Bx2 + C; but this is\nthe equation of a plane.\nConversely, if f(x1, x2) is a part of a plane, then it equals Ax1+Bx2+C for\nsome constants A, B, and C. Then the map x(u1, u2) = (λAu1+Bu2, λBu1-\nAu2) with λ2 =\n1+A2+B2 is isothermal. To check this, we see that φ1 = λA -\niB, φ2 = λB +iA, φ2\n1 = λ2A2 -B2 -2λABi, φ2\n2 = λ2B2 -A2 +2λABi. x3 =\nAx1 + Bx2 + C = A(λAu1 + Bu2) + B(λBu1 -Au2) + C, so φ3 = λ(A2 + B2)\nand φ2 = λ2(A2+B2)2. Then φ2\n1+φ2\n2+φ2\n3 = λ2(A2+B2)-(A2+B2)+λ2(A2+\nB2)2 = (A2 + B2)(λ2 -1 + λ2(A2 + B2)) = (A2 + B2)(λ2(1 + A2 + B2) -1) =\n(A2 + B2)(1 -1) = 0, so this is isothermal.\n15.3\nBernstein's Theorem\nTheorem 15.3.1 (Bernstein's Theorem, Osserman 5.1). Let f(x1, x2)\nbe a solution of the non-parametric minimal surface equation defined in the\nentire x1, x2 plane. Then there exists a nonsingular linear transformation\nx1 = u1, x2 = au1+bu2 with b > 0 such that u1, u2 are isothermal parameters\non the entire u-plane for the minimal surface S defined by xk = fk(x1, x2)\n(3 ≤k ≤n).\n\nProof. Define the map ξ as in our version of Osserman Lemma 4.4. Osserman\nLemma 5.4 shows that this is a diffeomorphism from the entire x-plane onto\nthe entire ξ-plane. We know from Osserman Lemma 4.4 that ξ is a set of\nisothermal parameters on S. By Osserman Lemma 4.3 (which Nizam proved),\nthe functions φk(ζ) = ∂xk\n∂ξ1 -i ∂xk\n∂ξ2 (1 ≤k ≤n) are analytic functions of ζ.\nWe can see that I( φ1φ2) = -∂(x1,x2)\n∂(ξ1,ξ2) ; since this Jacobian is always positive\n(see proof of Osserman Lemma 4.4), we can see that φ1 = 0, φ2 = 0, and\nthat Iφ2\nφ1 =\n|φ1|2I( φ1φ2) < 0. So the function φ2\nφ1 is analytic on the whole\nζ-plane and has negative imaginary part everywhere. By Picard's Theorem,\nan analytic function that misses more than one value is constant, so φ2\nφ1 = C\nwhere C = a -ib. That is φ2 = (a -ib)φ1. The real part of this equation is\n∂x2\n∂ξ1 = a ∂x1\n∂ξ1 -b ∂x1\n∂ξ2 , and the imaginary part is ∂x2\n∂ξ2 = b ∂x1\n∂ξ1 + a ∂x1\n∂ξ2 . If we then\napply the linear transformation from the statement of the theorem, using\nthe a and b that we have, this becomes\n∂u1\n∂ξ1 =\n∂u2\n∂ξ2 and\n∂u2\n∂ξ2 = -∂u1\n∂ξ2 : the\nCauchy-Reimann equations! So u1 + iu2 is an analytic function of ξ1 + iξ2.\nBut by Osserman Lemma 4.5, this implies that u1, u2 are also isothermal\nparameters, which proves the theorem.\nThis (with Osserman Lemma 5.5) has the immediate corollary that for\nn = 3, the only solution of the non-parametric minimal surface equation on\nthe entire x-plane is surface that is a plane. This gives us a nice way to\ngenerate lots of weird minimal surfaces in dimensions 4 and up by starting\nwith analytic functions; this is Osserman Corollary 3, but I do not have time\nto show this.\n\nChapter 16\nManifolds and Geodesics\nReading:\n- Osserman [7] Pg. 43-52, 55, 63-65,\n- Do Carmo [2] Pg. 238-247, 325-335.\n16.1\nManifold Theory\nLet us recall the definition of differentiable manifolds\nDefinition 16.1.1.

Let S be a minimal surface. Every regular point of\nS has a neighborhood in which there exists a reparametrization of S in terms\nof isothermal parameters.\n(Lemma 4.5 in [7]). Let a surface S be defined by x(u), where u1, u2 are\nisothermal parameters, and let S be a reparametrization of S defined by a\ndiffeomorphism u( u). Then u1, u2 are also isothermal parameters if and only\nif the map u( u is either conformal or anti-conformal.\n(Lemma 6.1 in [7]). Let S be a regular minimal surface in Rn defined by\na map x(p) : M →Rn. Then S induces a conformal structure on M.\n\nProof. Assume the surface S is orientable, and A be an oriented atlas of M.\nLet A be the collection of all the maps ( Uα, Vα, φα) ∈A such that φ-1\nβ * φα\npreserves orientation wherever defined, and the map x* φα : Uα →Rn defines\na local surface in isothermal parameters. By Lemma 16.1 the union of Vα\nequals M, so A is an atlas for M. And by Lemma 16.1 each φβ * φα is\nconformal wherever defined. So A defines a conformal structure on M.\nWith the previous lemma, we can discuss some basic notions connected\nwith conformal structure. If M has a conformal structure, then we can define\nall concepts which are invariant under conformal mapping, such as analytic\nmaps of one such manifold M into another\nM.\nExample 7.

A generalized minimal surface S in Rn is a non-\nconstant map x(p) : M →Rn, where M is a 2-manifold with a conformal\nstructure defined by an atlas A = {Uα, Vα, φα}, such that each coordinate\nfunction xk(p) is harmonic on M, and furthermore\nn\nX\nk=1\nφ2\nk(ζ) = 0\n(16.4)\n\nw'\nN\nO\nS\nP\nw\nFigure 16.3: Stereographic Projection\nwhere we set for an arbitrary a,\nhk(ζ) = xk(φα(ζ))\n(16.5)\nφk(ζ) = ∂hk\n∂ξ1\n-i∂hk\n∂ξ2\n,\nζ = ξ1 + iξ2\n(16.6)\nFollowing is a lemma from Ch.4 in [7]\n(Lemma 4.3 in [7]). Let x(u) define a regular minimal surface, with u1, u2\nisothermal parameters. Then the function φk(ζ) defined by 16.6 are analytic,\nand they satisfy equation\nn\nX\nk=1\nφ2\nk(ζ) = 0\n(16.7)\nand\nn\nX\nk=1\n|φ2\nk(ζ)| = 0.\n(16.8)\nConversely, let φ1(ζ), ..., φn(ζ) be analytic functions of ζ which satisfy Eqs. 16.7\nand 16.8 in a simply-connected domain D. Then there exists a regular min-\nimal surface x(u) defined over D, such that Eqs. 16.6 are valid.\nCorollary 16.1.7. If S is regular minimal surface, then S is also a gener-\nalized minimal surface.\n\nProof. We can use the conformal structure defined in Lemma 6.1, and the\nresult follows from Lemma 4.3 in [7]\nDefinition 16.1.8. Let S be a generalized minimal surface, and ζ ∈S. The\nbranch points ζ's with respect to the function φk correspond to the ζ's at\nwhich\nn\nX\nk=1\n|φ2\nk(ζ)| = 0\n(16.9)\nCorollary 16.1.9. Let S be a generalized minimal surface, and S′ be the\nsurface S with branch points with respect to the function φ in Eq. 16.6 deleted.\nThen S′ is a regular minimal surface.\nProof. Let x(p) be the coordinate map of S, where p ∈S. Since x(p) is non\nconstant, at least one of the function xk(p) is non constant. That means that\nthe corresponding φk(ζ) can have at most isolated zeroes, and the equation\nn\nX\nk=1\n|φ2\nk(ζ)| = 0\n(16.10)\ncan hold at most at the branch points. Since S′ consists of the whole surface\nS without the branch points, S′ is a regular minimal surface, from Lemma\n4.3 in [7].\nIn the case of n = 2 in the definition of a generalized surface, either\nx1 + ix2 or x1 -x2 is a non-constant analytic function f(ζ). The branch\npoints on the surface satisfy the Eq. 16.9. That is, they satisfy the equation\nf ′(ζ) = 0, which is the inverse mapping.\nFor large n, the difference between regular and generalized minimal sur-\nfaces consists in allowing the possibility of isolated branch points. However,\nthere are theorems where the possible existence of branch points has no effect.\nThe following lemma is one of the example.\n(Lemma 6.2 in [7]). A generalized minimal surface cannot be compact\n\nProof. Let S be a generalized minimal surface defined by a map x(p) : M →\nRn. Then each coordinate function xk(p) is harmonic on M. If M were\ncompact, the function xk(p) would attain its maximum, hence it would be a\nconstant. This contradicts the assumption that the map x(p) is non-constant.\n16.2\nPlateau Problem\nOne of the prime examples of extending the properties of generalized surface\nto regular surface is the classical Plateau problem, which is discussed in the\nappendix of [7].\nFigure 16.4: A 13-polygon surface obtained for a cubical wire frame\nDefinition 16.2.1. An arc z(t) is simple if z(t1) = z(t2) only for t1 = t2.\nA Jordan curve is a simple closed curve.\nProposition 16.2.2. (Osserman) Let Γ be an arbitrary Jordan curve in R3.\nThen there exists a regular simply connected minimal surface bounded by Γ.\nThe existence of a solution to the general case was independently proven\nby Douglas (1931) [3] and Rad`o (1933) [8], although their analysis could\n\nnot exclude the possibility of singularities (i.e. for the case of generalized\nminimal surface). Osserman (1970) [6] and Gulliver (1973) [4] showed that\na minimizing solution cannot have singularities [9].\nTable 16.1: Development on the Plateau's problem in 1970-1985\nMeeks and Yau\nWhen the curve Γ defined in Prop. 16.2.2 lies on the\nboundary of a convex body, then the surface\nobtained is embedded (i.e. without self-intersections).\nGulliver and Spruck\nThey proved the result from Meeds and Yau under\nthe additional assumption that the total curvature\nof Γ was at most 4π.\nFigure 16.5: An Enneper surface\n16.3\nGeodesics\nA geodesics is analogue to the straight line on a Euclidean plane. In or-\nder to define geodesics, we first have to understand the notion of covariant\nderivative, which is analogue to the usual differentiation of vectors in the\nplane.\n\nDefinition 16.3.1. A vector field w in an open set U in the regular surface\nS assigns to each p ∈U a vector w(p) ∈Tp(S). The vector field is differen-\ntiable at p if, for some parametrization x(u, v) in p, the components a and\nb of w = axu + bxv in the basis of {xu, xv} are differentiable functions at p.\nThe vector field is differentiable in U if it is differentiable for all p ∈U.\nDefinition 16.3.2. Let w be a differentiable vector field in an open set U ⊂S\nand p ∈U. Let y ∈Tp(S) and α : (-o, o) →U a parametrized curve with\nα(0) = p and α′(0) = y. Let w(t) be the restriction of the vector field w\nto the curve α. Then the covariant derivative at p of the vector field w\nrelative to the vector y, (Dw/dt)(0), is given by the vector obtained by the\nnormal projection of (dw/dt)(0) onto the plane Tp(S).\np\np\nw\n(Dw/dt)\ny\nN\nα\n(dw/dt)\nS\nT (S)\nFigure 16.6: The covariant derivative\nDefinition 16.3.3. A vector field w along a parametrized curve α : I →S\nis said to be parallel is Dw/dt = 0 for every t ∈I.\n\nw\nα\nFigure 16.7: A parallel vector field w along the curve α.\nDefinition 16.3.4. A non-constant, parametrized curve γ : I →S is said to\nbe geodesic at t ∈I if the field of its tangent vectors γ′(t) is parallel along\nγ at t, that is\nDγ′(t)\ndt\n= 0\n(16.11)\nFrom Eq. 16.11, we know that |γ′(t)| =constant, thus the arc length s\nis proportional to the parameter t, and thus we can reparametrize γ with\nparameter s. Note also that Eq. 16.11 implies that α′′(s) = kn is normal to\nthe tangent plane, or parallel to the normal to the surface. Therefore another\nway to define a geodesic is a regular curve which its principal normal at each\npoint p along the curve is parallel to the normal to S at p.\nBelow are some examples of geodesics:\nExample 8 (Geodesics on the sphere S2). The great circles C of a sphere\nS2 are obtained by intersecting the sphere with a plane that passes through\nthe center O of the sphere. The principal normal at a point p ∈C lies in the\ndirection of the line that connects p to O, the center of C. Since this is also\nthe direction of the normal at p, the great circles are geodesics.\n\nExample 9 (Geodesics on a right circular cylinder over the circle\nx2 + y2 = 1). It is clear that the circles obtained by the intersection of the\ncylinder with planes that are normal to the axis of the cylinder are geodesics.\nThe straight lines of the cylinder are also geodesics. To find other geodesics\non the cylinder C, consider the parametrization\nx(u, v) = (cos u, sin u, v)\n(16.12)\nof the cylinder in a point p ∈C, with x(0, 0) = p. Then x is an isometry that\nmaps a neighborhood U of (0, 0) of the uv-plane into the cylinder. Since the\ncondition of being a geodesic is local and invariant by isometries, the image\nof straight lines in U under the map x should be a geodesic on C. Since a\nstraight line on the uv-plane can be expressed as\nu(s) = as,\nv(s) = bs,\na2 + b2 = 1,\n(16.13)\nit follows that a geodesic of the cylinder is locally of the form\n(cos as, sin as, bs)\n(16.14)\nwhich is a helix.\nx\n(0,0)\nplane\nuv-\nFigure 16.8: Geodesics on a cylinder\n\n16.4\nComplete Surfaces\nIn order to study regular surfaces globally, we need some global hypothesis\nto ensure that the surface cannot be extended further as a regular surface.\nCompactness serves this purpose, but it would be useful to have a weaker\nhypothesis than compctness which could still have the same effect.\nDefinition 16.4.1.

If\nS is extendable, then there exists a regular (connected) surface S such that\nS ⊂ S. Since S is a regular surface, S is open in S.

Since p ∈Bd(S), some q0 ∈ V belongs\nto S. Let γ : [0, 1] → S be a geodesic of S, with γ(0) = p and γ(1) = q0.\nIt is clear that α : [0, o) →S, given by α(t) = γ(1 -t), is a geodesic of S,\nwith α(0) = q0, the extension of which to the line R would pass through p\nfor t = 1. Since p /∈S, this geodesic cannot be extended, which contradicts\nthe hypothesis of completness and concludes the proof.\nProposition 16.4.4. A closed surface S ⊂R3 is complete\nCorollary 16.4.5.

A function f : U →C is conformal at z ∈U ifff is\na complex-analytic function at z and f ′(z) = 0.\nProof. Let B be the matrix representation of dfz in the usual basis. Then f\nis conformal ⇔B = cA where A ∈SO(2) and c > 0. Thus\nBBT = c2I\n⇔\nBT = (det B)B-1\n(17.1)\n\nLet z = x + iy and f(z) = f(x, y) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y), then\nB =\nA\nux\nvx\nuy\nvy\n!\n(17.2)\nwhere uy = ∂u\n∂y.

A Riemann Surface M is a 1-dim complex analytic\nmanifold, i.e. each p ∈M has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to a\nneighborhood in C, and the transition functions are complex analytic.\nIn order to study Riemann surface, one needs to know the basic of har-\nmonic and subharmonic functions.\nTable 17.1: The analogues of harmonic and subharmonic functions on R\nR\nC\nLinear\nHarmonic\nConvex\nsubharmonic\nDefinition 17.3.2.

If g : R →\nR is convex and g ≤ h on (c, d) for h a harmonic function, then either\ng < h or g ≡ h there.\nSubharmonic functions on C are just the equivalents of convex functions\non mathbbR.\nDefinition 17.3.5. A function g : M →R is subharmonic on a Riemann\nsurface M if\n1. g is constant.\n2. For any domain D and any harmonic functions h : D →R, if g ≤h\non D, then g < h on D or g = h on D.\n3.

Now we prove a proposition that will show WERs importance\nlater.\nProposition Let M be a minimal surface with isothermal parameteriza-\ntion x(u, v). Then the Gauss map of M is a conformal map.\nproof In order to show N to be conformal we only need to show |dNp(xu)| =\n\nρ(u, v)|xu|, |dNp(xv)| = ρ(u, v)|xv| and dNp(xu).dNp(xv) = ρ2xu.xv Latter\nis trivial because of the isothermal coordinates. We have the following eqns\nfor dNp(xu) and dNp(xv)\ndNp(xu) = Nu = -e\nE xu -f\nGxv\n(18.20)\ndNp(xv) = Nv = -f\nE xu -g\nGxv\n(18.21)\nBy minimality we have e + g = 0. Using above eqns the Gauss map is\nconformal with scaling factor\n√\ne2+f2\nE\n=\np\n|K| It turns out that having a\nconformal Gauss map almost characterizes minimal surfaces:\nProposition Let M be a surface parameterized by x(u, v) whose Gauss\nmap N : M -→S2 is conformal. Then either M is (part of) sphere or M is\na minimal surface.\nproof We assume that the surface is given by an orthogonal parameter-\nization (F = 0) Since xu.xv = 0 by conformality of N Nu.Nv = 0 using the\nformulas (13) (14) one gets f(Ge + Eg) = 0 therefore either e = 0 (at every\npoint) or Ge + eG = 0(everywhere). The latter is minimal surface equality.\nIf the surface is not minimal then f = 0. Now use f = 0, confomality and\n(13), (14) to get\ne2\nE = Nu.Nu = ρ2E, g2\nG = Nv.Nv = ρ2G\nMultiplying across each equation produces\ne2\nE2 = g2\nG2 ⇒e\nG = ± g\nG\nThe last equation with minus sign on LHS is minimal surface equation so we\nmay just consider the case e/E = g/G = k. Together with f = 0 we have\nNu = -kxu and Nv = -kxv this shows that xu and xv are eigenvectors of\nthe differential of the Gauss map with the same eigenvalue. Therefore any\n\npoint on M is an umbilical point. The only surface satisfying this property\nis sphere so were done.\nSteographic Projection: St : S2 -N -→R2 is given by St(x, y, z) =\n(x/(1-z), y/(1-z), 0) We can consider the Gauss map as a mapping from the\nsurface to C ∪infby taking its composite with steographic projection.Note\nthat the resulting map is still conformal since both of Gauss map and Steo-\ngraphic are conformal. Now we state a thm which shows that WER can\nactually be attained naturally:\nTheorem Let M be a minimal surface with isothermal parameterization\nx(u, v) and WER (f, g). Then the Gauss map of M, G : M -→C ∪infcan\nbe identified with the meromorphic function g.\nproof Recall that\nφ1 = 1\n2f(1 -g2), φ2 = i2f(1 + g2), φ3 = fg\nWe will describe the Gauss map in terms of φ1, φ2 and φ3.\nxu × xv = ((xu × xv)1, (xu × xv)2, (xu × xv)3)\n(18.22)\n= (x2\nux3\nv -x3\nux2\nv, x3\nux1\nv -x1\nux3\nv, x1\nux2\nv -x2\nux1\nv)\n(18.23)\nand consider the first component x2\nux3\nv -x3\nux2\nv we have\nx2\nux3\nv -x3\nux2\nv = 4Im(φ2φ\n3)\nSimilarly (xu × xv)2 = 4Im(φ2φ\n1) and (xu × xv)3 = 4Im(φ1φ2) Hence we\nobtain\nxu × xv = 4Im(φ2φ3, φ3φ1, φ1φ2) = 2Im(φ × φ)\nNow since x(u, v) is isothermal |xu × xv| = |xu||xv| = E = 2|φ|2. Therefore\nwe have\nN = xu × xv\n|xu × xv| = φ × φ\n|φ|2\n\nNow\nG(u, v) = St(N(u, v))\n(18.24)\n= St( xu × xv\n|xu × xv|)\n(18.25)\n= St(φ × φ\n|φ|2 )\n(18.26)\n= St(2Im(φ2φ3, φ3φ1, φ1φ2)|φ|2)\n(18.27)\n= (\n2Im(φ2φ3)\n|φ|2 -2Im(φ1φ2)\n,\n2Im(φ3φ1)\n|φ|2 -2Im(φ1φ2)\n, 0)\n(18.28)\nIdentifying (x, y) in R2 with x + iy ∈C allows us to write\nG(u, v) = 2Im(φ2φ3) + 2iIm(φ3φ1)\n|φ|2 -2Im(φ1φ2)\nNow its simple algebra to show that\nG(u, v) =\nφ3\nφ1 -iφ2\nBut that equals to g so were done.\n\nChapter 19\nGauss Maps and Minimal\nSurfaces\n19.1\nTwo Definitions of Completeness\nWe've already seen do Carmo's definition of a complete surface -- one where\nevery partial geodesic is extendable to a geodesic defined on all of R. Os-\nserman uses a different definition of complete, which we will show to be\nequivalent (this is also exercise 7 on page 336 of do Carmo).\nA divergent curve on S is a differentiable map α: [0, inf) →S such that for\nevery compact subset K ⊂S there exists a t0 ∈(0, inf) with α(t) ∈K for all\nt > t0 (that is, α leaves every compact subset of S). We define the length of a\ndivergent curve as limt→inf\nR t\n0 |α′(t)| dt, which can be unbounded. Osserman's\ndefinition of complete is that every divergent curve has unbounded length.\nWe will sketch a proof that this is an equivalent definition.\nFirst, we will assume that every divergent curve in S has unbounded\nlength and show that every geodesic in S can be extended to all of R. Let\nγ : [0, o) →S be a geodesic that cannot be extended to all of R; without\nloss of generality assume specifically that it cannot of be extended to [0, inf).\nThen the set of numbers x such that γ can be extended to [0, x) is nonempty\n\n(because it contains o) and bounded above (because it cannot be extended to\n[0, inf)), so it has an inf R. We note that since we can extend γ to [0, R -δ)\nfor all (small) δ, we can in fact extend it to γ′ : [0, R) →S. Because γ′ has\nconstant speed, it must tend to a limit point q ∈Rn (by completeness of\nRn using a standard topological definition of completeness involving Cauchy\nsequences). Let α: [0, inf) →S be defined by α(t) = γ′(R(1 -e-t). Then\nα is just a reparametrization of γ′, so it has the same length as γ′, which is\n(because γ′ is a geodesic) a constant multiple of R and thus bounded. So if\nwe can show that α is a divergent curve, we will have a contradiction. Clearly\nq is also a limit point of α, since it is a reparametrization of γ′. If q ∈S, then\na regular neighborhood of q is contained in S and we could have extended\nthe geodesic further, so q ∈Bd(S) -S. So if α is in a compact (and thus\nclosed) subset of S for arbitrarily large values of t, q must be in that set too,\nwhich is a contradiction. So in fact every geodesic can be extended to R.\nNext we assume that every geodesic can be extended to all of R and\nshow that every divergent curve has unbounded length.\nLet α be a di-\nvergent curve with bounded length.\nThen we have for any k > 0 that\nlimn→inf\nR n+k\nn\n|α′(t)| dt = 0 -- that is, points on α get arbitrarily close to\neach other, so because R3 is complete (in the Cauchy sense) α has a limit\npoint q in R3. q cannot lie on S, because otherwise (the image under a chart\nof) a closed ball around q would be a compact set that α doesn't leave, and\nwe know that α is divergent. So q ∈S. I don't quite see how to finish the\nproof here, but if it's true that if S is any surface (not just a complete one)\nthen S -{p} is not complete (in the geodesic sense), then this implies that\nour surface is not complete. I'm not sure if that's true though.\n19.2\nImage of S under the Gauss map\nOne very important consequence of the WERI representation is that the\nGauss map N : S →S2 is just the function g, with S2 the Riemann sphere;\n\nthat is, if p: S2 →C∪{inf} is stereographic projection, then g = p*N. Nizam\nproved this in his notes; the proof is mostly a matter of working through the\nalgebra.\nLemma 19.2.1 (Osserman Lemma 8.4). A minimal surface S ⊂R3 that\nis defined on the whole plane is either a plane or has an image under the\nGauss map that omits at most two points.\nProof. We can find a WERI representation unless φ1 = iφ2 and φ3 = 0,\nbut this means that x3 is constant so that S is a plane. Otherwise, g is\nmeromorphic in the entire plane, so by Picard's Theorem it takes on all\nvalues with at most two exceptions or is constant; so the Gauss map either\ntakes on all values except for maybe two or is constant, and the latter case\nis a plane.\nTheorem 19.2.2 (Osserman Theorem 8.1). Let S be a complete regular\nminimal surface in R3. Then S is a plane or the image of S under N is\ndense in the sphere.\nProof. If the image is not everywhere dense then it omits a neighborhood\nof some point, which without loss of generality we can assume to be N =\n(0, 0, 1). If we can prove that x is defined on the entire plane, then by the\nprevious lemma we have our result. I do not entirely understand the proof,\nbut it involves finding a divergent path of bounded length.\nWe note that this implies Bernstein's Theorem, since a nonparametric\nminimal surface misses the entire bottom half of the sphere. So how many\npoints can we miss?\nTheorem 19.2.3 (Osserman Theorem 8.3). Let E be an arbitrary set\nof k ≤4 points on the unit sphere. Then there exists a complete regular\nminimal surface in R3 whose image under the Gauss map omits precisely the\nset E.\n\nProof. We can assume (by rotation) that E contains the north pole N =\n(0, 0, 1). If in fact E = {N}, then we can take f(ζ) = 1 and g(ζ) = ζ, which\nclearly obey the properties that f and g must (as they are both analytic);\nsince g takes on all values in C, N must take on all values of S2 -{N} by in-\nverse stereographic projection. (This is called Enneper's surface.) Otherwise\nlet the points of E -{N} correspond to points wm ∈C under stereographic\nprojection. Let\nf(ζ) =\nQ(ζ -wm), g(ζ) = ζ\nand use WERI with the domain C -{w1, . . . , wk-1}. Clearly g takes on all\nvalues except for the points wm, so the image of the Gauss map omits only\nthe values in E. f and g are both analytic (since the points where it looks\nlike f would have poles are not in the domain). It remains to show that\nthe surface is complete. We can show that in general the path length of a\ncurve C equals\nR\nC\n2|f|(1 + |g|2)|dζ|. The only way a path can be divergent\nhere is if it tends towards infor one of the points wm; in the former case\nthe degree of |f|(1 + |g|2) is at least -1 (because there are at most three\nterms on the bottom of f), so it becomes unbounded; in the latter case g\ngoes to a constant and |f| becomes unbounded, so every divergent curve has\nunbounded length and the surface is complete.\nIt has been proven by Xavier (see p 149 of Osserman) that no more than\nsix directions can be omitted, and as of the publication of Osserman it is not\nknown whether five or six directions can be omitted.\n19.3\nGauss curvature of minimal surfaces\nNizam showed that the Gauss curvature of a minimal surface depends only\non its first fundamental form as K = -\n2g11∆(ln g11); doing the appropriate\ncalculations (starting with g11 = 2|φ|2 shows that we can write it in terms of\n\nf and g as\nK = -\nμ\n4|g′|\n|f|(1 + |g|2)2\n¶2\nThis implies that the Gauss curvature of a minimal surface is non-positive\neverywhere (which is not surprising, since K = k1k2 = -k2\n1). It also implies\nthat it can have only isolated zeros unless S is a plane. This is because K is\nzero precisely when the analytic (according to Osserman, though I don't see\nwhy) function g′ has zeros, which is either isolated or everywhere. But if g′\nis identically zero, then g is constant, so N is constant, so S is a plane.\nConsider, for an arbitrary minimal surface in R3, the following sequence\nof mappings:\nD\nx(ζ)\n--→S\nN-→S2\np-→C\nwhere p is stereographic projection onto the w-plane. The composition of all\nof these maps is g, as we have seen. Given a differentiable curve ζ(t) in D,\nif s(t) is the arc length of its image on S, then (as mentioned above)\nds\ndt = 1\n2|f|(1 + |g|2)|dζ\ndt |\nThe arc length of the image in the w-plane is simply\nabsdw\ndt = |g′(ζ)||dζ\ndt |\nbecause the composed map is g. If σ(t) is arc length on the sphere, then by\ncomputation on the definition of stereographic projection we can show that\ndσ\ndt =\n1 + |w|2|dw\ndt |\n(note that |w| here is the same as |g|. So dividing through we find that\ndσ\ndt\nds\ndt\n=\n4|g′|\n|f|(1 + |g|2)2 =\np\n|K|\n\nSo there is a natural definition of Gauss curvature in terms of the Gauss map.\nWe define the total curvature of a surface to be the integral\nRR\nK. We\ncan show that this is in fact equal to the negative of spherical area of the\nimage under the Gauss map, counting multiple coverings multiply.\n19.4\nComplete manifolds that are isometric\nto compact manifolds minus points\nTheorem 19.4.1 (Osserman 9.1). Let M be a complete Riemannian 2-\nmanifold with K ≤0 everywhere and\nRR\n|K| < inf.\nThen there exists a\ncompact 2-manifold ˆ\nM and a finite set P ⊂ˆ\nM such that M is isometric to\nˆ\nM -P.\n(Proof not given.)\nLemma 19.4.2 (Osserman 9.5). Let x define a complete regular minimal\nsurface S in R3. If the total curvature of Sis finite, then the conclusion of the\nprevious theorem holds and the function g = p *N extends to a meromorphic\nfunction on ˆ\nM.\nProof. We already know that K ≤0. This implies that\nRR\n|K| = |\nRR\nK|, the\nabsolute value of the total curvature, which is finite. So the previous theorem\nholds.\nThe only way that g could fail to extend is if it has an essential\nsingularity at a point of P, but that would cause it to assume (almost) every\nvalue infinitely often, which would imply that the spherical area of the image\nof the Gauss map is infinite, which contradicts our assumption of finite total\ncurvature.\nTheorem 19.4.3 (Osserman 9.2). Let S be a complete minimal surface\nin R3. Then the total curvature of S is -4πm for a nonnegative integer m,\nor -inf.\n\nProof. Since K ≤0, either\nRR\nK diverges to -inf, or it (the total curvature)\nis finite. Because K is preserved by isometries, we apply the previous lemma\nand see that the total curvature is the negative of the spherical area of the\nimage under g of ˆ\nM -P. Because g is meromorphic, it is either constant\nor takes on each value a fixed number of times m. So either the image is a\nsingle point (so the total curvature is -4π0) or an m-fold cover of the sphere\n(so the total curvature is -4πm).\n\nBibliography\n[1] L. Ahlfors. Complex Analysis.

Implicit Function Theorem Suppose f : Rn × Rm -→\nRm is continuously differentiable in an open set containing (a, b) and f(a, b) =\n0. Let M be the m×m matrix Dn+jf i(a, b), 1 ≤i, j ≤m If det(M) = 0, there\nis an open set A ⊂Rn containing a and an open set B ⊂Rm containing b,\nwith the following property: for each x ∈A there is a unique g(x) ∈B such\nthat f(x, g(x)) = 0. The function g is differentiable.\nproof Define F : Rn × Rm -→Rn × Rm by F(x, y) = (x, f(x, y)). Then\ndet(dF(a, b)) = det(M) = 0. By inverse function theorem there is an open\nset W ⊂Rn × Rm containing F(a, b) = (a, 0) and an open set in Rn × Rm\ncontaining (a, b), which we may take to be of the form A × B, such that\nF : A × B -→W has a differentiable inverse h : W -→A × B. Clearly h is\nthe form h(x, y) = (x, k(x, y)) for some differentiable function k (since f is of\nthis form)Let π : Rn ×Rm -→Rm be defined by π(x, y) = y; then π *F = f.\nTherefore f(x, k(x, y)) = f *h(x, y) = (π *F) *h(x, y) = π(x, y) = y Thus\nf(x, k(x, 0)) = 0 in other words we can define g(x) = k(x, 0)\nAs one might expect the position of the m columns that form M is im-\nmaterial. The same proof will work for any f ′(a, b) provided that the rank\n\nof the matrix is m.\nExample f : R2 -→R, f(x, y) = x2 + y2 -1. Df = (2x2y) Let (a, b) =\n(3/5, 4/5) M will be (8/5).

One can easily\nverify this by choosing I = (-1, 1), J = (0, 1) and g(x) =\n√\n1 -x2. Note\nthat the uniqueness of g(x) would fail to be true if we did not choose J\nappropriately.\nexample Let A be an m × (m + n) matrix. Consider the function f :\nRn+m -→Rm, f(x) = Ax Assume that last m columns Cn+1, Cn+2, ..., Cm+n\nare linearly independent. Break A into blocks A = [A′|M] so that M is\nthe m × m matrix formed by the last m columns of A. Now the equation\nAX = 0 is a system of m linear equations in m + n unknowns so it has a\nnontrivial solution. Moreover it can be solved as follows: Let X = [X1|X2]\nwhere X1 ∈Rn×1 and X2 ∈Rm×1 AX = 0 implies A′X1 +MX2 = 0 ⇒X2 =\nM -1A′X1. Now treat f as a function mapping Rn × Rm -→Rm by setting\nf(X1, X2) = AX . Let f(a, b) = 0. Implicit function theorem asserts that\nthere exist open sets I ⊂Rn, J ⊂Rm and a function g : I -→J so that\nf(x, g(x)) = 0.

      "content": "Chapter 5\nFirst Fundamental Form\n5.1\nTangent Planes\nOne important tool for studying surfaces is the tangent plane. Given a given\nregular parametrized surface S embedded in Rn and a point p ∈S, a tangent\nvector to S at p is a vector in Rn that is the tangent vector α′(0) of a\ndifferential parametrized curve α: (-o, o) →S with α(0) = p. Then the\ntangent plane Tp(S) to S at p is the set of all tangent vectors to S at p. This\nis a set of R3-vectors that end up being a plane.\nAn equivalent way of thinking of the tangent plane is that it is the image\nof R2 under the linear transformation Dx(q), where x is the map from a\ndomain D →S that defines the surface, and q is the point of the domain that\nis mapped onto p. Why is this equivalent? We can show that x is invertible.\nSo given any tangent vector α′(0), we can look at γ = x-1 *α, which is a\ncurve in D. Then α′(0) = (x *γ)′(0) = (Dx(γ(0)) *γ′)(0) = Dx(q)(γ′(0)).\nNow, γ can be chosen so that γ′(0) is any vector in R2. So the tangent plane\nis the image of R2 under the linear transformation Dx(q).\nCertainly, though, the image of R2 under an invertible linear transfor-\nmation (it's invertible since the surface is regular) is going to be a plane\nincluding the origin, which is what we'd want a tangent plane to be. (When\n\nI say that the tangent plane includes the origin, I mean that the plane itself\nconsists of all the vectors of a plane through the origin, even though usually\nyou'd draw it with all the vectors emanating from p instead of the origin.)\nThis way of thinking about the tangent plane is like considering it as\na \"linearization\" of the surface, in the same way that a tangent line to a\nfunction from R →R is a linear function that is locally similar to the function.\nThen we can understand why Dx(q)(R2) makes sense: in the same way we\ncan \"replace\" a function with its tangent line which is the image of R under\nthe map t 7→f ′(p)t + C, we can replace our surface with the image of R2\nunder the map Dx(q).\nThe interesting part of seeing the tangent plane this way is that you can\nthen consider it as having a basis consisting of the images of (1, 0) and (0, 1)\nunder the map Dx(q). These images are actually just (if the domain in R2\nuses u1 and u2 as variables)\n∂x\n∂u1 and\n∂x\n∂u2 (which are n-vectors).\n5.2\nThe First Fundamental Form\nNizam mentioned the First Fundamental Form. Basically, the FFF is a way\nof finding the length of a tangent vector (in a tangent plane). If w is a tangent\nvector, then |w|2 = w · w. Why is this interesting? Well, it becomes more\ninteresting if you're considering w not just as its R3 coordinates, but as a\nlinear combination of the two basis vectors\n∂x\n∂u1 and\n∂x\n∂u2. Say w = a ∂x\n∂u1 +b ∂x\n∂u2;\nthen\n|w|2\n=\na ∂x\n∂u1 + b ∂x\n∂u2\n\n·\na ∂x\n∂u1 + b ∂x\n∂u2\n\n= a2 ∂x\n∂u1 · ∂x\n∂u1 + 2ab ∂x\n∂u1 · ∂x\n∂u2 + b2 ∂x\n∂u2 · ∂x\n∂u2.\n(5.1)\nLet's deal with notational differences between do Carmo and Osserman.\ndo Carmo writes this as Ea2 + 2Fab + Gb2, and refers to the whole thing as\nIp : Tp(S) →R.1 Osserman lets g11 = E, g12 = g21 = F (though he never\n1Well, actully he's using u′ and v′ instead of a and b at this point, which is because\nthese coordinates come from a tangent vector, which is to say they are the u′(q) and v′(q)\n\nmakes it too clear that these two are equal), and g22 = G, and then lets the\nmatrix that these make up be G, which he also uses to refer to the whole\nform. I am using Osserman's notation.\nNow we'll calculate the FFF on the cylinder over the unit circle; the\nparametrized surface here is x: (0, 2π) × R →S ⊂R3 defined by x(u, v) =\n(cos u, sin u, v).\n(Yes, this misses a vertical line of the cylinder; we'll fix\nthis once we get away from parametrized surfaces.) First we find that ∂x\n∂u =\n(-sin u, cos u, 0) and ∂x\n∂v = (0, 0, 1). Thus g11 = ∂x\n∂u · ∂x\n∂u = sin2 u + cos2 u = 1,\ng21 = g12 = 0, and g22 = 1. So then |w|2 = a2 + b2, which basically means\nthat the length of a vector in the tangent plane to the cylinder is the same\nas it is in the (0, 2π) × R that it's coming from.\nAs an exercise, calculate the first fundamental form for the sphere S2\nparametrized by x: (0, π) × (0, 2π) →S2 with\nx(θ, φ) = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ).\n(5.2)\nWe first calculate that\n∂x\n∂θ = (cos θ cos φ, cos θ sin φ, -sin θ) and\n∂x\n∂φ =\n(-sin θ sin φ, sin θ cos φ, 0). So we find eventually that |w|2 = a2 + b2 sin2 θ.\nThis makes sense -- movement in the φ direction (latitudinally) should be\n\"worth more\" closer to the equator, which is where sin2 θ is maximal.\n5.3\nArea\nIf we recall the exterior product from last time, we can see that\n∂x\n∂u ∧∂x\n∂v\nis\nthe area of the parallelogram determined by ∂x\n∂u and ∂x\n∂v. This is analogous to\nthe fact that in 18.02 the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors is\nthe area of the parallelogram they determine. Then\nR\nQ\n∂x\n∂u ∧∂x\n∂v\ndudv is the\narea of the bounded region Q in the surface. But Nizam showed yesterday\nof some curve in the domain D.\n\nthat Lagrange's Identity implies that\n\n∂x\n∂u ∧∂x\n∂v\n\n=\n\n∂x\n∂u\n\n∂x\n∂v\n\n-\nμ∂x\n∂u · ∂x\n∂v\n¶2\n(5.3)\nThus\n∂x\n∂u ∧∂x\n∂v\n=\np\ng11g22 -g2\n12. Thus, the area of a bounded region Q in\nthe surface is\nR\nQ\np\ng11g22 -g2\n12dudv.\nFor example, let us compute the surface area of a torus; let's let the\nradius of a meridian be r and the longitudinal radius be a.\nThen the\ntorus (minus some tiny strip) is the image of x: (0, 2π) × (0, 2π) →S1 ×\nS1 where x(u, v) = ((a + r cos u) cos v, (a + r cos u) sin v), r sin u).\nThen\n∂x\n∂u = (-r sin u cos v, -r sin u sin v, r cos u), and ∂x\n∂v = (-(a+r cos u) sin v, (a+\nr cos u) cos v, 0).\nSo g11 = r2, g12 = 0, and g22 = (r cos u + a)2.\nThen\np\ng11g22 -g2\n12 = r(r cos u + a).

      "content": "Chapter 6\nCurves\n6.1\nCurves as a map from R to Rn\nAs we've seen, we can say that a parameterized differentiable curve is a\ndifferentiable map α from an open interval I = (-o, o) to Rn. Differentiability\nhere means that each of our coordinate functions are differentiable: if α is a\nmap from some I to R3, and α = (x(t), y(t), z(t)), then α being differentiable\nis saying that x(t), y(t), and z(t) are all differentiable. The vector α′(t) =\n(x′(t), y′(t), z′(t)) is called the tangent vector of α at t.\nOne thing to note is that, as with our notation for surfaces, our curve is\na differentiable map, and not a subset of Rn. do Carmo calls the image set\nα(I) ⊂R3 the trace of α. But multiple \"curves,\" i.e., differentiable maps,\ncan have the same image or trace. For example,\nExample 4. Let\nα(t) = (cos(t), sin(t))\n(6.1)\nβ(t) = (cos(2t), sin(2t))\n(6.2)\nγ(t) = (cos(-t), sin(-t))\n(6.3)\nwith t in the interval (-o, 2π + o).\n\nThen the image of α , β, and γ are all the same, namely, the unit circle\ncentered at the origin. But the velocity vector of β is twice that of α's, and\nγ runs as fast as α does, but in the opposite direction - the orientation of\nthe curve is reversed. (In general, when we have a curve α defined on (a, b),\nand define γ(-t) = α(t) on (-b, -a), we say α and γ differ by a change of\norientation.)\n6.2\nArc Length and Curvature\nNow we want to describe properties of curves. A natural one to start with\nis arc length. We define the arc length s of a curve α from a time t0 to a\ntime t as follows\ns(t) =\nZ t\nt0\nds\n(6.4)\n=\nZ t\nt0\nds\ndt dt\n(6.5)\n=\nZ t\nt0\n|α′(t)|dt\n(6.6)\nThe next property that we would like to define is curvature. We want\ncurvature to reflect properties of the image of our curve - i.e., the actual\nsubset C in Rn - as opposed to our map. Letting our curvature vector be\ndefined as α′′(t) has the problem that, while it measures how fast the tangent\nvector is changing along the curve, it also measures how large our velocity\nvector is, which can vary for maps with the same image. Looking back at\nExample 1, while both α and β's images were the unit circle, the velocity\nand acceleration vectors were different:\n\nα′(t) = (-sin t, cos t)\n(6.7)\nα′′(t) = (-cos t, -sin t), |α′′(t)| = 1\n(6.8)\nβ′(t) = (-2 sin(2t), 2 cos(2t))\n(6.9)\nβ′′(t) = (-4 cos(2t), -4 sin(2t)), |β′′(t)| = 4\n(6.10)\nA way to correct this problem is to scale our velocity vector down to unit\nlength - i.e., let ds/dt = 1. Then the magnitude of the velocity vector won't\nskew our curvature vector, and we'll just be able to look at how much the\nangle between neighboring tangent vectors is changing when we look at α′′(t)\n(how curved our curve is!)\nTo do this we parameterize by arc length. First, we look at the arc\nlength function s(t) =\nR t\nt0 |α′(t)|dt. If α′(t) = 0 for all t, then our function\nis always increasing and thus has an inverse s-1.\nSo instead of mapping\nfrom time, along an interval I, into length, we can map from length into an\ninterval I.\nDefinition 6.2.1. : A paramaterized differentiable curve α : I →R3 is\nregular if α′(t) = 0 for all t ∈I.\nThus to parameterize by arc length, we require our curve to be regular.\nThen, given a fixed starting point t0 going to a fixed end point t1, and the\nlength of our arc from t0 to t1 being L, we can reparameterize as follows:\n(0, L) →(t0, t1) →R3 (or Rn.)\nwhere the first arrow is given by s-1, and the second arrow is just our curve\nα mapping into real-space. If s ∈(0, L), and our reparameterized curve is β,\nthen β and α have the same image,and also |β′(s)| is |dt/ds · α′(t)| = 1. So\nafter reparamterizing by arc length, we have fixed the length of our velocity\nvector to be 1.\nNow we can properly define curvature.\n\nDefinition 6.2.2. Let α be a curve paramaterized by arc length. Then we\nsay that α′′(s) (where s denotes length) is the curvature vector of α at\ns, and the curvature at s is the norm of the curvature vector, |α′′(s)|.\nExample 5. Let's go back to the example of a circle, in this case with radius\nr.\nα(t) = (r sin(t), r cos(t)), and α′(t) = (r cos t, -r sin t). So |α′(t)| = r,\nand not 1. In order to correct for this, set\nβ(s) = (r sin(s/r), r cos(s/r)). Then β′(s) = (cos(s/r), -sin(s/r)) and\n|β′(s)| = 1. Our circle is now parameterized by arc length.\nThe curvature vector at a given length s is then\nβ′′(t) = (-(1/r) sin(s/r), -(1/r) cos(s/r))\n(6.11)\nand |β′′(s)| = 1/r. Appropriately, the bigger our circle is, the smaller the\ncurvature.\nExercise 2. Now we take a catenary, the curve we get if we hang a string\nfrom two poles.\nLet α(t) = (t, cosh t), where cosh(t) = (1/2)(et + e-t). Parameterize by\narc length and check that it works. The identities sinh(t) = (1/2)(et -e-t)\nand sinh-1(t) = ln(t + (t2 + 1)1/2) will be of use."

Then in the basis of\n{xu(q), xv(q)}, we have\nw = (u′(0), v′(0))\n(7.2)\n\n7.1.3\nDifferential of a (Differentiable) Map Between\nSurfaces\nIt is natural to extend the idea of differential map from T(R2) →T(S) to\nT(S1) →T(S2).\nLet S1, S2 be two regular surfaces, and a differential mapping φ ⊂S1 →\nS2 where V is open. Let p ∈V , then all the vectors w ∈Tp(S1) are velocity\nvectors α′(0) of some differentiable parameterized curve α : (-o, o) →V with\nα(0) = p.\nDefine β = φ *α with β(0) = φ(p), then β′(0) is a vector of Tφ(p)(S2).\n(Proposition 2-4-2). Given w, the velocity vector β′(0) does not depend\non the choice of α. Moreover, the map\ndφp : Tp(S1) →Tφ(p)(S2)\n(7.3)\ndφp(w) = β′(0)\n(7.4)\nis linear. We call the linear map dφp to be the differential of φ at p ∈S1.\nProof. Suppose φ is expressed in φ(u, v) = (φ1(u, v), φ2(u, v)), and α(t) =\n(u(t), v(t)), t ∈(-o, o) is a regular curve on the surface S1. Then\nβ(t) = (φ1(u(t), v(t)), φ2(u(t), v(t)).\n(7.5)\nDifferentiating β w.r.t. t, we have\nβ′(0) =\nμ∂φ1\n∂u u′(0) + φ1\n∂vv′(0), ∂φ2\n∂u u′(0) + φ2\n∂vv′(0)\n¶\n(7.6)\nin the basis of ( xu, xv).\nAs shown above, β′(0) depends on the map φ and the coordinates of\n(u′(0), v′(0) in the basis of {xu, xv}.\nTherefore, it is independent on the\nchoice of α.\n\n-ε\nε\nt\nx\np\nα'(0)\nS\nα\nβ\nφ\nV\n(p)\nS\n'(0)\nφ\nβ\nu\nv\nu\nv\nq\nq\nx\nx\nFigure 7.2: Graphical representation of the map dφp that sends α′(0) ∈\nTq(S1) to β′(0) ∈Tp(S2).\nMoreover, Equation 7.6 can be expressed as\nβ′(0) = dφp(w) =\nA ∂φ1\n∂u\n∂φ1\n∂v\n∂φ2\n∂u\n∂φ2\n∂v\n! A\nu′(0)\nv′(0)\n!\n(7.7)\nwhich shows that the map dφp is a mapping from Tp(S1) to Tφ(p)(S2). Note\nthat the 2 × 2 matrix is respect to the basis {xu, xv} of Tp(S1) and { xu, xv}\nof Tφ(p)(S2) respectively.\nWe can define the differential of a (differentiable) function f : U ⊂S →R\nat p ∈U as a linear map dfp : Tp(S) →R.\nExample 2-4-1: Differential of the height function Let v ∈R3. Con-\n\nsider the map\nh : S ⊂R3 →R\n(7.8)\nh(p) = v · p, p ∈S\n(7.9)\nWe want to compute the differential dhp(w), w ∈Tp(S). We can choose a\ndifferential curve α : (-o, o)) →S such that α(0) = p and α′(0) = w. We\nare able to choose such α since the differential dhp(w) is independent on the\nchoice of α. Thus\nh(α(t)) = α(t) · v\n(7.10)\nTaking derivatives, we have\ndhp(w) = d\ndth(α(t))|t=0 = α′(0) · v = w · v\n(7.11)\nExample 2-4-2: Differential of the rotation Let S2 ⊂R3 be the unit\nsphere\nS2 = {(x, y, z) ∈R3; x2 + y2 + z2 = 1}\n(7.12)\nConsider the map\nRz,θ : R3 →R3\n(7.13)\nbe the rotation of angle θ about the z axis.\nWhen Rz,θ is restricted to\nS2, it becomes a differential map that maps S2 into itself. For simplicity,\nwe denote the restriction map Rz,θ. We want to compute the differential\n(dRz,θ)p(w), p ∈S2, w ∈Tp(S2). Let α : (-o, o) →S2 be a curve on S2 such\nthat α(0) = p, α′(0) = w. Now\n(dRz,θ)(w) = d\ndt(Rz,θ *α(t))t=0 = Rz,θ(α′(0)) = Rz,θ(w)\n(7.14)\n\n7.1.4\nInverse Function Theorem\nAll we have done is extending differential calculus in R2 to regular surfaces.\nThus, it is natural to have the Inverse Function Theorem extended to the\nregular surfaces.\nA mapping φ : U ⊂S1 →S2 is a local diffeomorphism at p ∈U if\nthere exists a neighborhood V ⊂U of p, such that φ restricted to V is a\ndiffeomorphism onto the open set φ(V ) ⊂S2.\n(Proposition 2-4-3). Let S1, S2 be regular surfaces and φ : U ⊂S1 →\nS2 a differentiable mapping. If dφp : Tp(S1) →Tφ(p)(S2) at p ∈U is an\nisomorphism, then φ is a local diffeomorphism at p.\nThe proof is a direct application of the inverse function theorem in R2.\n7.2\nThe Geometry of Gauss Map\nIn this section we will extend the idea of curvature in curves to regular sur-\nfaces. Thus, we want to study how rapidly a surface S pulls away from the\ntangent plane Tp(S) in a neighborhood of p ∈S. This is equivalent to mea-\nsuring the rate of change of a unit normal vector field N on a neighborhood\nof p. We will show that this rate of change is a linear map on Tp(S) which is\nself adjoint.\n7.2.1\nOrientation of Surfaces\nGiven a parameterization x : U ⊂R2 →S of a regular surface S at a point\np ∈S, we choose a unit normal vector at each point x(U) by\nN(q) = xu ∧xv\n|xu ∧xv|(q), q ∈x(U)\n(7.15)\nWe can think of N to be a map N : x(U) →R3. Thus, each point q ∈x(U)\nhas a normal vector associated to it. We say that N is a differential field\n\nof unit normal vectors on U.\nWe say that a regular surface is orientable if it has a differentiable field\nof unit normal vectors defined on the whole surface. The choice of such a\nfield N is called an orientation of S. An example of non-orientable surface\nis M obius strip (see Figure 3).\nFigure 7.3: M obius strip, an example of non-orientable surface.\nIn this section (and probably for the rest of the course), we will only\nstudy regular orientable surface. We will denote S to be such a surface with\nan orientation N which has been chosen.\n7.2.2\nGauss Map\n(Definition 3-2-1). Let S ⊂R3 be a surface with an orientation N and\nS2 ⊂R3 be the unit sphere\nS2 = {(x, y, z) ∈R3; x2 + y2 + z2 = 1}.\n(7.16)\nThe map N : S →S2 is called the Gauss map.\nThe map N is differentiable since the differential,\ndNp : Tp(S) →TN(p)(S2)\n(7.17)\n\nat p ∈S is a linear map.\nFor a point p ∈S, we look at each curve α(t) with α(0) = p and compute\nN *α(t) = N(t) where we define that map N : (-o, o) →S2 with the same\nnotation as the normal field. By this method, we restrict the normal vector\nN to the curve α(t). The tangent vector N ′(0) ∈Tp(S2) thus measures the\nrate of change of the normal vector N restrict to the curve α(t) at t = 0. In\nother words, dNp measure how N pulls away from N(p) in a neighborhood\nof p. In the case of the surfaces, this measure is given by a linear map.\nExample 3-2-1 (Trivial) Consider S to be the plane ax + by + cz + d = 0,\nthe tangent vector at any point p ∈S is given by\nN =\n(a, b, c)\n√\na2 + b2 + c2\n(7.18)\nSince N is a constant throughout S, dN = 0.\nExample 3-2-2 (Gauss map on the Unit Sphere)\nConsider S = S2 ⊂R3, the unit sphere in the space R3. Let α(t) =\n(x(t), y(t), z(t)) be a curve on S, then we have\n2xx′ + 2yy′ + 2zz′ = 0\n(7.19)\nwhich means that the vector (x, y, z) is normal to the surface at the point\n(x,y,z).\nWe will choose N = (-x, -y, -z) to be the normal field of S.\nRestricting to the curve α(t), we have\nN(t) = (-x(t), -y(t), -z(t))\n(7.20)\nand therefore\ndN(x′(t), y′(t), z′(t)) = (-x′(t), -y′(t), -z′(t))\n(7.21)\nor dNp(v) = -v for all p ∈S and v ∈Tp(S2).\n\nExample 3-2-4 (Exercise: Gauss map on a hyperbolic paraboloid)\nFind the differential dNp=(0,0,0) of the normal field of the paraboloid S ⊂R3\ndefined by\nx(u, v) = (u, v, v2 -u2)\n(7.22)\nunder the parameterization x : U ⊂R2 →S.\n7.2.3\nSelf-Adjoint Linear Maps and Quadratic Forms\nLet V now be a vector space of dimension 2 endowed with an inner product\n⟨, ⟩.\nLet A : V →V be a linear map. If ⟨Av, w⟩= ⟨v, Aw⟩for all v, w ∈V ,\nthen we call A to be a self-adjoint linear map.\nLet {e1, e2} be a orthonormal basis for V and (αij), i, j = 1, 2 be the\nmatrix elements of A in this basis. Then, according to the axiom of self-\nadjoint, we have\n⟨Aei, ej⟩= αij = ⟨ei, Aej⟩= ⟨Aej, ei⟩= αji\n(7.23)\nThere A is symmetric.\nTo each self-adjoint linear map, there is a bilinear map B : V × V →R\ngiven by\nB(v, w) = ⟨Av, w⟩\n(7.24)\nIt is easy to prove that B is a bilinear symmetric form in V .\nFor each bilinear form B in V , there is a quadratic form Q : V →R\ngiven by\nQ(v) = B(v, v), v ∈V.\n(7.25)\nExercise (Trivial): Show that\nB(u, v) = 1\n2 [Q(u + v) -Q(v) -Q(u)]\n(7.26)\n\nTherefore, there is a 1-1 correspondence between quadratic form and self-\nadjoint linear maps of V .\nGoal for the rest of this section: Show that given a self-adjoint linear\nmap A : V →V , there exist a orthonormal basis for V such that, relative\nto this basis, the matrix A is diagonal matrix. Moreover, the elements of\nthe diagonal are the maximum and minimum of the corresponding quadratic\nform restricted to the unit circle of V .\n(Lemma (Exercise)). If Q(x, y) = ax2 = 2bxy+cy2 restricted to {(x, y); x2+\ny2 = 1} has a maximum at (1, 0), then b = 0\nHint: Reparametrize (x, y) using x = cos t, y = cos t, t ∈(-o, 2π + o) and\nset dQ\ndt |t=0 = 0.\n(Proposition 3A-1). Given a quadratic form Q in V , there exists an\northonormal basis {e1, e2} of V such that if v ∈V is given by v = xe1 + ye2,\nthen\nQ(v) = λ1x2 + λ2y2\n(7.27)\nwhere λi, i = 1, 2 are the maximum and minimum of the map Q on |v| = 1\nrespectively.\nProof. Let λ1 be the maximum of Q on the circle |v| = 1, and e1 to be\nthe unit vector with Q(e1) = λ1. Such e1 exists by continuity of Q on the\ncompact set |v| = 1.\nNow let e2 to be the unit vector orthonormal to e1, and let λ2 = Q(e2).\nWe will show that this set of basis satisfy the proposition.\nLet B be a bilinear form associated to Q. If v = xe1 + ye2, then\nQ(v) = B(v, v) = λ1x2 + 2bxy + λ2y2\n(7.28)\nwhere b = B(e1, e2). From previous lemma, we know that b = 0. So now it\nsuffices to show that λ2 is the minimum of Q on |v| = 1. This is trivial since\n\nwe know that x2 + y2 = 1 and\nQ(v) = λ1x2 + λ2y2 ≥λ2(x2 + y2) = λ2\n(7.29)\nas λ2 ≤λ1.\nIf v = 0, then v is called the eigenvector of A : V →V if Av = λv for\nsome real λ. We call the λ the corresponding eigenvalue.\n(Theorem 3A-1). Let A : V →V be a self-adjoint linear map, then there\nexist an orthonormal basis {e1, e2} of V such that\nA(e1) = λ1e1,\nA(e2) = λ2e2.\n(7.30)\nThus, A is diagonal in this basis and λi, i = 1, 2 are the maximum and\nminimum of Q(v) = ⟨Av, v⟩on the unit circle of V .\nProof. Consider Q(v) = ⟨Av, v⟩where v = (x, y) in the basis of ei, i = 1, 2.\nRecall from the previous lemma that Q(x, y) = ax2 + cy2 for some a, c ∈R.\nWe have Q(e1) = Q(1, 0) = a, Q(e2) = Q(0, 1) = c, therefore Q(e1 + e2) =\nQ(1, 1) = a + c and\nB(e1, e2) = 1\n2[Q(e1 + e2) -Q(e1) -Q(e2)] = 0\n(7.31)\nThus, Ae1 is either parallel to e1 or equal to 0. In any case, we have Ae1 =\nλ1e1. Using B(e1, e2) = ⟨Ae2, e1⟩= 0 and ⟨Ae2, e2⟩= λ2, we have Ae2 =\nλ2e2.\nNow let us go back to the discussion of Gauss map.\n(Proposition 3-2-1). The differential map dNp : Tp(S) →Tp(S) of the\nGauss map is a self-adjoint linear map.\nProof. It suffices to show that\n⟨dNp(w1), w2⟩= ⟨w1, dNp(w2)⟩\n(7.32)\n\nfor the basis {w1, w2} of Tp(S).\nLet x(u, v) be a parameterization of S at p, then xu, xv is a basis of Tp(S).\nLet α(t) = x(u(t), v(t)) be a parameterized curve in S with α(0) = p, we\nhave\ndNp(α′(0)) = dNp(xuu′(0) + xvv′(0))\n(7.33)\n= d\ndtN(u(t), v(t))|t=0\n(7.34)\n= Nuu′(0) + Nvv′(0)\n(7.35)\nwith dNp(xu) = Nu and dNp(xv) = Nv. So now it suffices to show that\n⟨Nu, xv⟩= ⟨xu, Nv⟩\n(7.36)\nIf we take the derivative of ⟨N, xu⟩= 0 and ⟨N, xv⟩= 0, we have\n⟨Nv, xu⟩+ ⟨N, xuv⟩= 0\n(7.37)\n⟨Nu, xv⟩+ ⟨N, xvu⟩= 0\n(7.38)\nTherefore\n⟨Nu, xv⟩= -⟨N, xuv⟩= ⟨Nv, xu⟩\n(7.39)"

      "content": "Chapter 8\nGauss Map I\n8.1\n\"Curvature\" of a Surface\nWe've already discussed the curvature of a curve. We'd like to come up with\nan analogous concept for the \"curvature\" of a regular parametrized surface S\nparametrized by x: U →Rn. This can't be just a number -- we need at the\nvery least to talk about the \"curvature of S at p in the direction v ∈Tp(S)\".\nSo given v ∈Tp(S), we can take a curve α: I →S such that α(0) = p\nand α′(0) = v. (This exists by the definition of the tangent plane.) The\ncurvature of α itself as a curve in Rn is d2α\nds2 (note that this is with respect\nto arc length). However, this depends on the choice of α -- for example,\nif you have the cylinder over the unit circle, and let v be in the tangential\ndirection, both a curve that just goes around the cylinder and a curve that\nlooks more like a parabola that happens to be going purely tangentially at p\nhave the same α′, but they do not have the same curvature. But if we choose\na field of normal vectors N on the surface, then d2α\nds2 ·Np is independent of the\nchoice of α (as long as α(0) = p and α′(0) = v). It's even independent of the\nmagnitude of v -- it only depends on its direction ˆv. We call this curvature\nkp(N, ˆv). For the example, we can see that the first curve's α′′ is 0, and that\nthe second one's α′′ points in the negative ˆz direction, whereas N points in\n\nthe radial direction, so kp(N, ˆv) is zero no matter which α you choose.\n(In 3-space with a parametrized surface, we can always choose N to be\nN =\nxu∧xv\n|xu∧xv|.)\nTo prove this, we see that α(s) = x(u1(s), u2(s)), so that dα\nds = du1\nds xu1 +\ndu2\nds xu2 and d2α\nds2 = d2u1\nds xu1+du1\nds\n¡ du1\nds xu1u1 + du2\ns xu1u2\n¢\n+d2u2\nds xu2+du2\nds\n¡du1\nds xu1u2 + du2\ns xu2u2\n¢\n.\nBut by normality, N · xu1 = N · xu2 = 0, so d2α\nds2 · N = P2\ni,j=1 bij(N) dui\nds\nduj\nds ,\nwhere bij(N) = xuiuj · N.\nWe can put the values bij into a matrix B(N) = [bij(N)]. It is symmetric,\nand so it defines a symmetric quadratic form B = II : Tp(S) →R. If we use\n{xu1, xu2} as a basis for Tp(S), then II(cxu1+dxu2) = ( c d )\nb11(N) b12(N)\nb21(N) b22(N)\n¡ c\nd\n¢\n.\nWe call II the Second Fundamental Form.\nII is independent of α, since it depends only on the surface (not on α).\nTo show that kp(N, ˆv) is independent of choice of α, we see that\nkp(N, ˆV ) = d2α\nds2 · N =\nX\nij\nbij(N)dui\nds\nduj\nds =\nP\ni,j bij(N) dui\ndt\nduj\ndt\n¡ ds\ndt\n¢2\nNow, s(t) =\nR t\nt0 |α′(t)| dt, so that\n¡ds\ndt\n¢2 = |α′(t)|2 = |du1\ndt xu1 + du2\ndt xu2|2 =\nP\ni,j\n¡ dui\ndt\n¢ 3\nduj\ndt\n\ngij, where gij comes from the First Fundamental Form. So\nkp(N, ˆv) =\nP\ni,j bij(N) dui\ndt\nduj\ndt\nP\ni,j gij\ndui\ndt\nduj\ndt\nThe numerator is just the First Fundamental Form of v, which is to say its\nlength. So the only property of α that this depends on are the derivatives\nof its components at p, which are just the components of the given vector v.\nAnd in fact if we multiply v by a scalar λ, we multiply both the numerator\nand the denominator by λ2, so that kp(N, ˆv) doesn't change. So kp(N, ˆv)\ndepends only on the direction of v, not its magnitude.\nIf we now let k1(N)p be the maximum value of kp(N, ˆv).\nThis exists\nbecause ˆv is chosen from the compact set S1 ⊂Tp(S).\nSimilarly, we let\n\nk2(N)p be the minimal value of kp(N, ˆv).\nThese are called the principle\ncurvatures of S at p with regards to N. The directions e1 and e2 yielding\nthese curvatures are called the principal directions. It will turn out that these\nare the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a linear operator defined by the Gauss\nmap.\n8.2\nGauss Map\nRecall that for a surface x: U →S in R3, we can define the Gauss map\nN : S →S2 which sends p to Np =\nxu1∧xu2\n|xu1∧xu2|, the unit normal vector at p.\nThen dNp : Tp(S) →TNp(S2); but Tp(S) and TNp(S2) are the same plane\n(they have the same normal vector), so we can see this as a linear operator\nTp(S) →Tp(S).\nFor example, if S = S2, then Np = p, so Np is a linear transform so it is\nits own derivative, so dNp is also the identity.\nFor example, if S is a plane, then Np is constant, so its derivative is the\nzero map.\nFor example, if S is a right cylinder defined by (θ, z) 7→(cos θ, sin θ, z),\nthen N(x, y, z) = (x, y, 0). (We can see this because the cylinder is defined\nby x2 + y2 = 1, so 2xx′ + 2yy′ = 0, which means that (x, y, 0) · (x′, y′, z′) = 0,\nso that (x, y, 0) is normal to the velocity of any vector through (x, y, z).)\nLet us consider the curve α with α(t) = (cos t, sin t, z(t)), then α′(t) =\n(-sin t, cos t, z′(t)).\nSo (N *α)(t) = (x(t), y(t), 0), and so (N *α)′(t) =\n(-sin t, cos t, 0). So dNp(xθ) = xθ. So in the basis {xθ, xz}, the matrix is\n¡ 1 0\n0 0\n¢\n. It has determinant 0 and 1\n2 trace equal to 1\n2. It turns out that the\ndeterminant of this matrix only depends on the First Fundamental Form,\nand not how it sits in space -- this is why the determinant is the same for\nthe cylinder and the plane. A zero eigenvalue can't go away no matter how\nyou curve the surface, as long as you don't stretch it."

      "content": "Modern Examples of Complete Embedded Minimal Surfaces of\nFinite Total Curvature\nDavid Glasser\nDecember 14, 2004\n1. Introduction. A natural class of minimal surfaces to study are the embedded mini\nmal surfaces -- those which have no selfintersections as a subset of R3. Of course, every\npoint of a surface immersed in R3 has a neighborhood which is embedded, so by itself\nthis isn't a very interesting restriction. However, an embedded minimal surface pro\nduced in this way is clearly extendable and thus not complete. Because of this, when\ncharacterizing embedded minimal surfaces, it is most interesting to restrict ourselves\nto those that are complete. There are many known examples of complete embedded\nminimal surfaces. Most of these surfaces, such as Scherk's First and Second Surfaces\nand the Schwarz P surface, have some sort of \"hole\" that appears periodically, leading\nto complicated topology;\nuntil the eighties the only known examples of finite topol\nogy were the plane, the catenoid, and the helicoid. When looking for further examples\nof complete minimal surfaces of finite topology, it is convenient to make the slightly\nstronger assumption of finite total curvature;\nonly the plane and the catenoid were\nknown in this category. With these conditions, we can apply a theorem of Osserman\n[10] to show that any such surface must be homeomorphic to a compact surface with a\nfinite number of points removed; we refer to the removed points as ends.\nThus every complete embedded minimal surfaces of finite total curvature can be\ncharacterized by two integers: its genus k and its number of ends r. Viewed this way,\nboth the plane and the catenoid have genus 0 (the sphere); the plane has one end and the\ncatenoid has two. Jorge and Meeks [8] made significant progress in proving nonexistence\nof such surfaces for a variety of k and r, but at that point the only examples known were\nstill the plane and the catenoid. In 1982, Costa [2] found a complete minimal surface of\ngenus 1 and three ends which seemed likely to be embedded, and Hoffman and Meeks\nproved that it was in fact embedded [6]. This quickly led to the further discovery of\na wide assortment of related surfaces, mostly also with three ends. In this paper, we\ndescribe a family of complete embedded minimal surfaces with three ends and arbitrary\npositive genus which includes Costa's surface.\nIn Section 2 we present general background on complete minimal surfaces of total\nfinite curvature, and in Section 3 describe the WeierstrassEnneper Representation. In\nSection 4 we describe the state of knowledge prior to Costa's discovery, the story of\nwhich is told in Section 5. In Section 6, we define the generalized Costa surface of genus\nk and sketch proofs of its properties; this section is based heavily on [5]. In Section 7,\nwe describe newer examples of complete minimal surfaces of finite topology. Finally, in\nSection 8 we describe the techniques and benefits of creating physical models of minimal\nsurfaces.\n\nRR\nZ\n2. Background. Given a surface S, we define H to be the mean of the principal\n(maximum and minimum) curvatures at a point, and the Gaussian curvature K to be\ntheir product.\nWe call a surface on which H is identically zero a minimal surface.\nFor the purposes of this paper, we will assume that all surfaces are regular, connected,\nand orientable. A complete surface is one where every curve s: [0, )\nS which is\n→\ngeodesic can be extended to a geodesic defined on all of R. Alternatively, a surface is\ncomplete if every divergent curve has unbounded length, where a divergent curve on\nS is a differentiable map α: [0, inf) → S which eventually leaves every compact subset\nof S.\nA surface S is said to be of finite topological type, or more simply to be of\nfinite topology, if it is homeomorphic to a compact surface M of genus k with r points\n{p1, . . . , pr} removed; let M = M - {p1, . . . , pr}. We will continue to use S, k, r, M,\nand M in this way for the remainder of this essay. We define total curvature of a surface\nto be C(S) =\nK dA; for a minimal surface, K is nonpositive so C(S) is either a finite\nnonpositive number or -inf. The total curvature of a minimal surface is equal to the\nnegative of the spherical area (counting multiple covers) of the surface under the Gauss\nmap.\n3. The WeierstrassEnneper Representation on Manifolds. Given any surface\nin R3, we can always locally introduce isothermal coordinates (u1, u2). We can then\nconsider it to be a Riemann surface of one complex parameter z = u1 + u2i. We then\nconsider the function g = σ\nG\nX, where X : D\nS is the coordinate map on a\n*\n→\nsimply connected domain in C\n*\n, G: S\nS2 is the Gauss map, and σ: S2 → C ∪ {inf} is\n→\nstereographic projection; if S is minimal then g is meromorphic. (For the rest of this\npaper, we will refer to both g and G as \"the Gauss map\", but will continue to distinguish\nbetween the two by capitalization.) Incredibly, it turns out out that any meromorphic\nfunction D\nC is the Gauss map of some minimal surface immersed in R3 . In fact,\n→\nthere are many minimal surfaces with g as its Gauss map: given any analytic function\nf : D\nC, the map X : D\nR3 defined by\n→\n→\nz\nX(z) = <\nΦ dz\nz0\nwhere\nΦ = (φ1, φ2, φ3) = ((1 - g 2)f, i(1 + g 2)f, 2fg)\nis a conformal minimal immersion of D into R3 with Gauss map g. This immersion is\nregular if the poles of g coincide with the zeros of f, and at each such point the order\nof the pole is exactly half the order of the zero.\nThis representation is called the WeierstrassEnneper representation; its discovery\nmade it very easy to find new minimal surfaces, because all one has to do is choose\ntwo simple functions and integrate. However, an complete embedded minimal surface\ncreated in this way will be topologically equivalent to the domain it is mapped from, and\nthus will have genus zero. So in order to use the WeierstrassEnneper Representation to\nfind a minimal surface of higher genus, we have to extend it to be defined on manifolds\nother than simply connected domains in C. This can be done naturally by changing\nf dz to a holomorphic oneform η; however, this does give us one extra condition that\nwe need to check to ensure that the surface is welldefined.\nTheorem 31 (WeierstrassEnneper Representation Theorem, [5] Theorem 1.0). Let\nM be a Riemann surface, η a holomorphic oneform on M, and g: M → C ∪ {inf} a\n\nmeromorphic function. Consider the vectorvalued oneform\nΦ = (φ1, φ2, φ3) = ((1 - g 2)η, i(1 + g 2)η, 2gη)\nThen\nZ p\nX(p) = <\nΦ\np0\nis a conformal minimal immersion which is welldefined on M and regular, provided\nthat no component of Φ has a real period on M and that the poles of g coincide with the\nzeros of η and the order of each pole of g is half the order of the corresponding zero of\nη. g is the Gauss map of the surface.\n4. Results Prior to Costa. The most important result for the classification of com\nplete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature is the theorem of Osserman [10] which\nallows us to completely characterize the topology of such a surface by a nonnegative\ninteger k and a positive integer r.\nTheorem 41 (Osserman, [10] Lemma 9.5). If X : M → S ⊂ R3 defines a com\nplete minimal surface, then there exists a compact 2manifold M and a finite number of\npoints p1, p2, . . . , pr on M such that M is isometric to M -{p1, p2, . . . , pr}. Moreover,\nthe Gauss map g: M\nC (that is, the composition of X, the Gauss map N on the\n→\nsurface, and stereographic projection) extends to a meromorphic function on all of M.\nNote that r must be positive because there are no compact minimal surfaces. For the\nrest of this paper, we will refer to the underlying compact manifold of a surface as M, the\npunctured manifold as M, its coordinate map as X, and the surface itself as S. We refer\nto the image under X of a punctured neighborhood of one of the points pi in M as an\nas an end. There are three key results in this theorem. First, in the context of complete\nminimal surfaces, finite total curvature implies finite topological type. (The converse\nis now known to be almost true: it was shown in 1997 by Collin [1] based on work by\nMeeks and Rosenberg [9] that every nonplanar complete embedded minimal surface of\nfinite topological type either has finite total curvature or has exactly one end, but not\nboth.) Because S is complete, as q ∈ M approaches one of the deleted points pi, X(q)\n|\n|\nmust grow without bound. Because the Gauss map g of the surface can be extended\nto M, limq→M g(X(q)) must exist, so each end has a welldefined normal vector. (Note\nthat it does not necessarily have an asymptotic plane -- it can also continue to grow\nlogarithmically in the direction of its normal vector.) Jorge and Meeks [8] proved the\nsomewhat intuitive result that for any complete embedded minimal surface of finite total\ncurvature in R3, the normal vectors on the ends of M are parallel; this makes sense,\nbecause otherwise the planes which the ends approach would intersect.\nBy rotation,\nwe can assume that the normal vectors on the ends all are the north and south poles of\nthe sphere. That is, we can assume that the Gauss map g has a zero or a pole at each\nend of M.\nIt was known that for a complete minimal surface M in Rn of finite total curvature\nC(M), C(M) ≤ 2π(χ(M) -r). For the surface of genus k with r ends we have χ(M) =\n2 - 2k - r, so C(M) ≤ -4π(k + r - 1). Jorge and Meeks [8] showed that for a surface\nimmersed in R3, equality holds here if and only if all of the ends are embedded. Thus,\nany minimal surface with total curvature -4π(k + r - 1) is embedded outside of a\ncompact set (the image of M minus the neighborhood of the punctures). They then\nused their results to show that the plane is the only embedded complete minimal surface\n\nof finite total curvature with r = 1, and that the only such surfaces with k = 0 and\nr ≤ 5 are the plane and the sphere.\n5. Discovery of the Costa Surface. In his 1982 thesis [2], Costa identified a com\nplete minimal surface\nhomeomorphic to the torus with three points removed.\nThe\nCosta surface is an conformal embedding of the square torus -- the torus defined by\nidentifying opposite sides of the unit square in the complex plane. Any map f defined\non this torus can be considered as a map defined on the entire complex plane, which is\nthe universal covering space of the torus; the lifted map will satisfy the condition that\nf(z + 1) = f(z + i) = f(z) for all z. That is, maps defined on the square torus are\nequivalent to maps defined on C with periods 1 and i; such doubly periodic functions are\ncalled elliptic. Every nonconstant elliptic function has at least two poles (in each unit\nsquare); it turns out that every elliptic function is a rational combination of a function\nwith two poles called the Weierstrass ℘function and its first derivative. Thus ℘ and\n℘0 are natural candidates for use in constructing a minimal surface homeomorphic to a\npunctured torus.\nCosta defined his surface by using a WeierstrassEnneper representation of g =\n√\n2π℘( 1\n2 ) and η = ℘(ζ)dζ; the domain used was the unit square torus with the points\n℘0 (ζ)\nremoved. Costa showed that this surface had total curvature -12π.\n-4π(k + r - 1), by the result of Jorge and Meeks above this implied that\nthe ends of the Costa surface are embedded. In order to prove that this was the first\nat 0,\n, and\ni\nSince -12π =\ndiscovered complete embedded minimal surface of finite total curvature and positive\ngenus, it remained only to show that the complement of the ends in the surface (a\ncompact set) is embedded.\nHowever, while the WeierstrassEnneper representation provides a simple way of\ndemonstrating the existence of a minimal surface, it does not make it particularly easy\nto visualize it or discover many of its geometric properties. Specifically, the Weierstrass\nEnneper representation does not provide any information about whether or not the sur\nface is embedded. D. Hoffman and Meeks, as described in [3], sought out to understand\nthe Costa surface; with help from J. Hoffman, they created computer images of the\nCosta surface that revealed its structure. As this was 1984, the computer work was\nnot a simple matter of plugging some equations into a commercial software package;\nrather, it was a significant programming project which evolved over the course of their\nresearch. They saw that the Costa surface appears similar to the union of a catenoid\nwith a plane through its waist circle, with two pairs of \"tunnels\" reminiscent of Scherk's\nSecond Surface passing between the plane and the catenoid ends in order to make it\ninto one coherent surface.\nIt appeared to Hoffman and Meeks that the Costa surface had a D4 symmetry\ngroup, and that the section of the surface in each octant of R3 was a graph over a\nplane. Using these insights, they were able to prove that it was in fact embedded. Even\nmore impressively, they were quickly able to generalize their proofs to demonstrate\nthe existence of a complete embedded minimal surface of finite total curvature with\nthree ends of any positive genus. The Weierstrass ℘function and its derivative ℘0 used\nin Costa's definition satisfy the differential equation ℘02 = 4℘(℘2 - t), where t is a\nc\nconstant. Let us set z = ℘(ζ) and w = ℘0(ζ). Then we have g = w and η = zdζ.\nz\nWe see that dz = d℘(ζ) = ℘0(ζ)dζ = wdζ, so η = w dz. Thus, instead of using the\nc\nWeierstrassEnneper representation g = ℘0 (ζ) and η = ℘(ζ)dζ defined on C modulo the\n\nP\nP\nR\nR\nc\nlattice of integers, we can equivalently use g = w and η = z dz defined on the manifold\nw\n2 w2 = z(z - 1)}. Because this representation avoids the explicit\n{(z, w) ∈ (C ∪ {inf} |\nuse of ℘, it is no longer tied intrinsically to the torus and has a simple generalization to\nsurfaces of higher genus, as we will show in the following section.\n6. Definition of the Costa Surfaces of Arbitrary Genus. We will demonstrate\nthe existence of a complete minimal surface of finite total curvature of genus k and 3\nembedded ends, following the method of [5]. We first consider the 2manifold defined\nby\nk+1\nM =\nw\n= z k(z - 1)}\n{(z, w) ∈ (C ∪ {inf})2|\nThis equation is inspired by the differential equation for ℘ demonstrated in Section 5.\nWe can imagine this as a 2manifold embedded in C2 or R4 (with the caveat that z and\nw can both be the point inf on the Riemann sphere). Considered as a covering surface\nof the zplane, M has a branch point at z = 0, 1, and -1, where the defining equation\nbecomes wk+1 = 0; each of these branch points are thus of order k. In addition, because\nthere are an odd number of branch points evident from the equation, it also has a branch\npoint of order k at z = inf. By the RiemannHurwitz formula ([7], Theorem 4.16.3), we\nknow that the genus g of the surface is given by g = 1 - n + 2\nni, where n is the\norder w in the defining equation 0 = wk-1 - zk(z2 - 1) and ni is the order of the ith\nbranch point. So n = k + 1 and\nni = 4k, so g = 1 - (k + 1) + 14k = k; thus M is in\nfact a compact surface of genus k.\nWe let p0 = (0, 0), p1 = (1, 0), p-1 = (-1, 0), and pinf = (inf, inf); these are the\nbranch points of the surface and are each the unique point of M with its zcoordinate.\nWe remove the points p1, p-1, and pinf from M to create M, a genusk surface with three\nc\nends. Note that the branch point p0 is still in M. We let g = w (where c is a positive\nk\nz\nreal constant that will be determined later) and η =\nw\ndz =\n2w dz. (While the\nz -1\nfirst form of η follows more naturally from Costa's original definition, the second form is\neasier to work with because it has no poles on M.) We see here that the pole of g does\np\ncoincide with the zero of η.\nThe minimal surface is thus defined by X(p) = <\nΦ for\np0\np ∈ M, where\nΦ\n=\n(φ1, φ2, φ3) = ((1 - g 2)η, i(1 + g 2)η, 2gη)\n\nzk\nc2zk\nzk\nc2zk\n2c\n=\nwk - wk+2\ndz, i\n+\ndz,\ndz\nwk\nwk+2\nz2 - 1\nIn order to show that this in fact a conformal minimal immersion, we need to show\nthat this is independent of path chosen in the integral; that is, we must show that\n< C Φ is zero for any closed path C. Studying the symmetry of M and S is very useful\nz,\nfor this. The mappings κ(z, w) = ( w) and λ(z, w) = (-z, ρkw) where ρ = eπi/(k+1)\nare conformal mappings of order 2 and 2k + 2 respectively which generate the dihedral\ngroup D2k+2. This group leaves M invariant, and fixes both p0 and pinf; κ fixes p1 and\np-1 while λ interchanges them. These roughly correspond to the transformations of R3\n⎛\n⎞\n⎛\n⎞\ncos θ\nsin θ\nK = ⎝0\n-1\n0 ⎠ L = ⎝- sin θ\ncos θ\n0 ⎠ θ =\nπ\n-1\nk + 1\n\nR\nR\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\n\nZ\n\nThat is, we can show that κ∗ Φ = KΦ and λ∗ Φ = LΦ, where α∗ Ψ means the operator\nα should be applied to M before it is given to the oneform Ψ. This implies that S also\nhas a D2k+2 symmetry group, generated by K and L.\nTo demonstrate that\nΦ has no real period, we need to show that\nC Φ is purely\nimaginary, for C a closed curve around each of the ends and for C each element of a\nit\nhomology basis of M. First let β be the loop in the zplane defined by β (t) = 1 + 2e\nwhere t ∈ [0, 2π], and let β be the lift of β to M, which winds once around the end p1.\nLet -β be β followed in reverse; we note that this is the same as β\nβ. Thus\n= κ *\nΦ =\nΦ = -\nκ β\nΦ =\n=\nΦ\nβ\n-\n-β\n-\nβ\nκ ∗ Φ\n-K\nβ\n*\nBecause K preserves the first and third coordinates, this implies that <\n0; that is, < β Φ is orthogonal to the (x1, x3)plane.\npeated with\nφ1 =\nβ φ3 =\nβ\n<\nThe same argument can be re\nλ-1κλ and L-1KL in place of κ and L, which will show that <\northogonal to a vertical plane making an angle of\nπ\nwith the x1axis, so together this\nΦ is\nβ\nk+1\nshows that <\nΦ is zero. So Φ has no real periods at the end p1. A similar argument\nβ\nshows that Φ has no real periods at its other two ends.\n2c dz\nIt is not too hard to analyze φ3 = z -1; in fact, φ3 = c d ln\nz-1\n. Thus we can\nz+1\nexplicitly show that\nz - 1\nz + 1\n(61)\np\nX3(p) = <\nφ3 = c ln\np0\n(where z is the zcoordinate of p); this shows that X3 is independent of path. It remains\nto show that φ1 and φ2 are independent of path. It is a slightly lengthy process to show\nthat their integrals are zero around a homology basis of M as long as c is chosen to be\na specific positive real constant; see [5] for details.\nWe show that the surface is regular by showing that the functions φi never all vanish.\nIn fact, φ3 is only zero at p0, and φ1 is nonzero there.\nIt is now simple to prove that\nthe total curvature of the surface is -4π(k + r - 1) = -4π(k + 2), which is to say that\nthe Gauss map covers the Riemann sphere k + 2 times. Ignoring the finite number of\nc\npunctures, the Gauss map g = w hits each point of the Riemann sphere for exactly\none value of w. Therefore, the multiplicity of the covering of the sphere is equal to\nthe number of points of M having the same value of w.\nFor fixed w, the equation\nwk+1 = zk(z2 - 1) is a polynomial of degree k + 2 in z, so there are k + 2 points\n(z, w) with any given value of w.\nThus the Gauss map covers the Riemann sphere\nk + 2 times, so that the total curvature of the generalized Costa surface of genus k\nis -4π(k + 2) = -4π(k + r - 1). This shows both that the surface has finite total\ncurvature and, by the result of Jorge and Meeks mentioned in Section 4, that the ends\nof the surface are embedded, parallel, and mutually disjoint.\nThe equation 61 for X3(p) is especially useful for understanding the geometry of S.\nIf we let ζ = z-1, then 61 becomes X3(p) = c ln |ζ|; this tells us that the intersection\nz+1\nt is the image of the circle of radius e\nt\nc\nof S with the plane\naround the origin\nx3 =\nin the ζplane. Thus the part of M over the unit circle in the ζplane is sent to the\nx3plane, the part of M over the unit disk in the ζplane is sent to the the half of\nthe surface below the x3plane, and the part of M over the rest of the ζplane is sent\nto the half of the surface above the x3plane. We can see directly from equation 61\nthat X3(p) → +inf as p → p-1, that X3(p) → -inf as p → p1, and that X3(p) →\n\nas p → pinf. This implies that the ends at p1 and p-1 are catenoidstyle ends whose\nX3 coordinates grow logarithmically; pinf is a planar end asymptotic to the (x1, x2)\nplane. Because the map between ζ and z is a M obius transformation, circles separating\n0 = ζ(p1) from inf= ζ(p-1) in the ζplane are equivalent to circles separating p1 from\np-1 in the zplane, with the exception of the unit circle in the ζplane, which is mapped\nonto the union of the imaginary line and inf(a circle in the Riemann sphere). Because\neach of the circles in the zplane (not counting the exceptional one) separate one branch\npoint (p1 or p-1) from the other three, they each cross over a branch cut. So their lift\nto M (that is, the set of all points of M whose zcoordinate lies on the circle) is a single\nconnected simple closed curve. So the crosssection of S at x3\n(for t =6\n0) is a\nclosed curve, though we have not yet shown that it is simple. On the other hand, the\nt\nc\n= e\nimaginary line contains the branch point p0, so its lift is the union of k +1 straight lines\nwith one point in common; thus the intersection of S with the x3plane is k + 1 straight\nlines intersecting at the origin.\nWe have already shown that the symmetry group of S contains K and L and the\nD2k+2 group generated by them; in fact, it turns out that this is the entire symmetry\ngroup. To describe the symmetries geometrically we use the following notation: P0 is\nthe (x1, x2)plane and Pj is the plane containing the x3 axis and the line in the (x1, x2)\nplane making an angle of (j -1)π/(k + 1) with the positive x1axis (for 1 ≤j ≤k + 1).\nk+1\nA sector of R3 is a component of R3 -∪\nPj; there are 4k + 4 sectors and D2k+2\nj=0\nacts transitively on them. We let lj be the line in the (x1, x2)plane making an angle of\nπ 2j+1 with the positive x1axis, for 0 ≤j ≤k; then each line lj bisects the projection\n2k+2\nof a sector onto the (x1, x2)plane. Then the orientationpreserving symmetries of S\nare L2j, the rotation by\n2πj radians around the x3axis (0 ≤j ≤k) and L2j+1K, the\nk+1\nrotation by π radians around lj (0 ≤j ≤k). (Note that the identity is the first type\nwith j = 0.) The orientationreversing symmetries are L2(j-1)K, the reflection through\nPj (1 ≤ j ≤ k + 1), and L2j+1, the rotation by π(2j+1) radians around the x3axis\nk+1\nfollowed by reflection in P0. Each catenoidal end is made up of pieces of 2k + 2 of the\nsectors; both the middle plane and a neighborhood of the origin 0 = X(p0) are made up\nof all 4k + 4 sectors. As mentioned above, the intersection of S with the plane x3 = 0\nis the image of k + 1 lines with one point of each identified; in fact, it is equal to the\nunion of the k + 1 lines lj. The intersection of S with any other plane x3 = t is a simple\nclosed curve.\nThis symmetry structure can be used to show that each sector is in fact a graph\nover an appropriately chosen plane. Thus S is embedded. So S is a complete embedded\nminimal surface of finite total curvature, genus k, and 3 ends, and it has a symmetry\ngroup D2k+2 with 4(k +1) elements. In fact, Hoffman and Meeks showed that any such\nsurface with at least 4(k + 1) elements in its symmetry group is in fact similar to this\ngeneralized Costa surface.\nPreviously, the Costa surface was described as appear like the union of a catenoid\nand a plane with tunnels that appear like Scherk's Second Surface. These similarities\nare reflected by the limiting behavior of the surfaces, as described in [4]. If Sk is the\ngeneralized Costa surface of genus k, then the sequence Sk has a subsequence that\nconverges as k →inf to the union of the plane and the catenoid. In addition, if Sˆk is\na normalized version of Sk such that the maximum value of K is equal to 1 and is at\nthe origin, then the sequence Sˆk has a subsequence that converges to Scherk's Second\nSurface.\n\n7. Other Complete Minimal Surfaces of Finite Topology. Hoffman and Meeks\nshowed, as described in [4], that each surface Sk lies in a oneparameter family Sk,x\n(x ≥ 1) of embedded minimal surfaces of genus k and finite total curvature; Sk = Sk,1.\nThe surfaces with x > 1 have all three ends of \"catenoid\" type (that is, growing loga\nrithmically) and a symmetry group generated by k vertical reflection planes. Intuitively,\nthis can be imagined as taking the \"tunnels\" that flow into the bottom catenoid half\nand pushing down on them until they are flowing separately into the bottom catenoidal\nplane.\nSeveral other families of complete embedded minimal surfaces of finite total curva\nture are mentioned in [4], although for most of them the surface is not embedded for all\nvalues of x. These include fourended examples with c ≥ 2 vertical planes of symmetry,\none horizontal plane of symmetry, genus 2(c- 1), two flat ends and two catenoid ends; a\noneparameter family deforming these surfaces through surfaces with four catenoid ends;\na variant of the same surfaces with symmetric tunnels through their waist plane; and\na series of fiveended examples. In addition, Hoffman, Karcher, and Wei constructed\na new complete embedded minimal surface of finite topology with one end (and thus\ninfinite total curvature); this is called the \"helicoid with a handle\".\n8. Physical Modeling. In [3], Hoffman waxes eloquently about the value of computer\ngraphics in his study of minimal surfaces. While I could never have even imagined the\nCosta surfaces without viewing computer graphics, and while the graphics I could find\nwith a few seconds on Google in 2004 are vastly superior to what Hoffman could create\nwith much labor in 1984, I still found it difficult to truly imagine the Costa surface just\nby looking at computer images. I decided to make physical models of the Costa surfaces.\nAfter experimenting with several different materials, I settled on Crayola Model Magic,\nan airdrying, flexible artificial claylike product.\nMy first attempt at creating a Costa surface started by creating the two catenoid\nlike ends and trying to merge them together to form the central plane. After much trial\nand error, I ended up attaching two tubes to start to form the tunnels to each side;\na little more massaging yielded a passable model of the Costa surface. For my second\nattempt, I wanted to highlight the symmetry properties of the surface, and specifically\nthe eight octants that are mapped onto each other transitively by the symmetry group\nof the surface. I made four green and four white wedgeshaped pieces; the long edges\nformed the catenoid ends (two green and two white pieces each), while the shorter end\nsplit in half, with one tab going in to meet with the other seven pieces at the origin and\nthe other tab spreading out to form the waist plane. This construction made it clear\nhow the plane and the neighborhood of the origin were all composed of all eight pieces,\nand also showed (because each colored piece should lie entirely in one octant) where\nthe directions of maximum and minimum height on the wait plane are. I plan to create\nsimilar models of the higher genus Costa surfaces as well.\nWhile the computer graphics were a good starting place, the ability to physically\nhold a Costa surface in my hand allowed several of its properties to be immediately\nvisible. For example, if one colors the two sides of the surface distinct colors, the fact\nthat the Gauss map covers the Riemann sphere three times is clear: you can see exactly\nthree places where either color faces in any given direction (for example, one color faces\nup at the origin and at the limits of the top of the upper catenoid and the bottom of\nthe lower catenoid). The fact that the surface has genus one can be seen by trying to\nlink one's fingers around the surface (without crossing any of the three infinite planes\n\nor putting the fingers into the same hole from two different directions) like holding a\ndonut; this can be done exactly once, so the surface has genus 1. A similar operation\ncan be performed on the higher genus surfaces.\nReferences\n[1] Pascal Collin. Topologie et courbure des surfaces minimales proprement plong ees\nde R3 . Ann. of Math.

      "content": "Minimal Surfaces as Isotropic Curves in C3: Associated\nminimal surfaces and the Bj orling's problem\nby\nKai-Wing Fung\nSubmitted to the Department of Mathematics\non December 1, 2004, in partial fulfillment of the\nrequirements for the degree of\nBachelor of Science in Mathematics\nAbstract\nIn this paper, we introduce minimal surfaces as isotropic curves in C3. Given such a\nisotropic curve, we can define the adjoint surface and the family of associate minimal\nsurfaces to a minimal surface that is the real part of the isotropic curve. We study\nthe behavior of asymptotic lines and curvature lines in a family of associate surfaces,\nspecifically the asymptotic lines of a minimal surface are the curvature lines of its\nadjoint surface, and vice versa.\nIn the second part of the paper, we describe the Bj orling's problem. Given a real-\nanalytic curve and a real-analytic vector field along the curve, Bj orling's problem is to\nfind a minimal surface that includes the curve such that its unit normal field coincides\nwith the given vector field. We shows that the Bj orling's problem always has a unique\nsolution. We will use some examples to demonstrate how to construct minimal surface\nusing the results from the Bj orling's problem. Some symmetry properties can be\nderived from the solution to the Bj orling's problem. For example, straight lines are\nlines of rotational symmetry, and planar geodesics are lines of mirror symmetry in a\nminimal surface. These results are useful in solving the Schwarzian chain problem,\nwhich is to find a minimal surface that spanned into a frame that consists of finitely\nmany straight lines and planes.\nThesis Supervisor: Emma Carberry\nTitle: C.L.E.

It has at-\ntracted the attention for both mathematicians and natural scientists for different\nreasons. Mathematicians are interested in studying minimal surfaces that have cer-\ntain properties, such as completedness and finite total curvature, while scientists are\nmore inclined to periodic minimal surfaces observed in crystals or biosystems such as\nlipid bilayers.\nSince a surface surrounded by a boundary is minimal if it is an area minimizer,\nearly mathematician search minimal surface by solving the Lagrange variational prob-\nlem, which leads to a partial differential equation for such area-minimizing surface.\nHowever, in Chapter 2, we will discuss how to describe minimal surfaces using the\nWeierstrass-Enneper representation, which can generate minimal surfaces given an\narbitrary holomorphic \"Weierstrass function\". Such powerful tool allows us to choose\ndifferent functions to generate minimal surfaces. The representation also gives rise to\nideas such as isotropic curve, adjoint surfaces and associate family of surfaces. Cur-\nvature lines and asymptotic lines can also be expressed in the form of the Weierstrass\nfunction.\nChapter 3 is about \"Bj orling's Problem\", which is to find a minimal surface that\ncoincides with a given real-analytic curve and a real-analytic normal field along the\ncurve. We will show that it is simple to write down a unique solution that solves\nBj orling's problem with Weierstrass-Enneper representation. In Chapter 4 we will\n\nstudy the Bj orling's problem further to show that straight lines and planar curves\nhave interested symmetry properties in minimal surfaces. This provides the funda-\nmentals to solve the Schwarzian chain problem, which is to find a minimal surface\nthat is spanned into certain frame consisting finitely many straight lines and planes.\nThese minimal surfaces are particularly interesting to scientists, since the \"frame\" can\nserve as a building block to bigger minimal surfaces using reflexive and translational\nsymmetry.\nComputer graphics gives visualization to minimal surface, and thus is a very useful\ntool in studying minimal surface. In the last chapter, we will briefly describe how to\nuse computer programs such as Maple and Surface Evolver to study minimal surface.\nChapters 2 to 4 are based on [4], which provides a comprehensive account of\nminimal surface. The Maple procedures in Section 5.1 are discussed in [5]. For more\ninformation about the program Surface Evolver, reader are referred to the program\nmanual [2].\n\nChapter 2\nThe Adjoint Surface and the\nFamily of Associate Minimal\nSurfaces\nThe Weierstrass-Enneper representation provides a powerful tool to generate minimal\nsurfaces. In this chapter, we will show that Weierstrass-Enneper representation is\nnothing but expressing a minimal surface X as the real part of some isotropic curve\nf in C3. Furthermore, the imaginary part of the isotropic curve is also a minimal\nsurface, which is called the \"adjoint surface\" of X. We can also show that for every\nminimal surface X, there exists a one parameter associate family of minimal surfaces\nwhich includes X and its adjoint surface. We will finish this chapter by studying the\nbehavior of asymptotic lines and curvature lines in the associate family, and some\nexamples of minimal surfaces.\n2.1\nWeierstrass-Ennerper Representations\nWe start by stating the Weierstrass-Enneper representations of minimal surfaces.\nTheorem 2.1.1 (Weierstrass-Ennerper Representation I). For every noncon-\n\nstant minimal surface\nX(w) = (x(w), y(w), z(w)),\nw ∈Ω⊂C\ndefined on a simply connected domain Ω, there are a holomorphic function μ and a\nmeromorphic function ν in Ωwith μ ≡0, ν ≡0 such that μν2 is holomorphic in Ω,\nand that\nx(w)\n=\nR\nR w\nw0\n2μ(1 -ν2) dζ\ny(w)\n=\nR\nR w\nw0\ni\n2μ(1 + ν2) dζ\nz(w)\n=\nR\nR w\nw0 μν dζ\n(2.1)\nholds for w, w0 ∈Ω.\nConversely, two functions μ and ν as above define by means of 2.1 a minimal\nsurface X : Ω→R3 provided that Ωis simply connected.\nIf we introduce a function\nF(w) = μ(w)\nν′(w)\n(2.2)\nthen we have another representation of minimal surfaces:\nTheorem 2.1.2 (Weierstrass-Ennerper Representation II). Let F(w) be a\nholomorphic function in a simply connected domain Ωof C, F ≡0 and set\nΦ(w) = ((1 -w2)F(w), i(1 + w2)F(w), 2wF(w)).\n(2.3)\nThen\nX(w) = R\nZ w\nw0\nΦ(w) dw,\nw ∈Ω\n(2.4)\ndefines a non-constant minimal surface X : Ω→R3.\n2.2\nAdjoint Surface\nIt is natural to ask what will happen if we consider the imaginary part of the argu-\nments in the Weierstrass-Ennerper representation. Let X(u, v) = (x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)\n\nbe a minimal surface defined on a simply connected domain Ω∈R ∼= C with\n∆X = 0\n(2.5)\n∥Xu∥2 = ∥Xv∥2,\n⟨Xu, Xv⟩= 0,\n(u, v) ∈Ω.\n(2.6)\nDefinition 2.2.1. A surface X∗(u, v) = (x∗(u, v), y∗(u, v), z∗(u, v)) is said to be an\nadjoint surface to X(u, v) on Ωif the following Cauchy-Riemann equations\nXu = X∗\nv,\nXv = -X∗\nu\n(2.7)\nhold in Ω.\nIt is immediate that\n∆X∗= 0,\n∥X∗\nu∥2 = ∥X∗\nv∥2,\n⟨X∗\nu, X∗\nv⟩= 0\n(2.8)\nand thus X∗is also a minimal surface.\nConsider a mapping\nf(w) = X(u, v) + iX∗(u, v),\nw = u + iv ∈Ω,\n(2.9)\nthen f is a holomorphic mapping of Ωinto C3 with components\nf(w) =\n(f 1(w), f 2(w), f 3(w))\nf j(w) =\nxj(w) + i(x∗)j(w)\n(2.10)\nfor j = 1, 2, 3.\nIf we define the complex derivative of f by\nf ′ = df\ndw = Xu + iX∗\nu = Xu -iXv,\n(2.11)\nthen we have\n⟨f ′, f ′⟩= ∥Xu∥2 -∥Xv∥2 -2i ⟨Xu, Xv⟩= 0\n(2.12)\n\nWe say that the holomorphic curve f is a isotropic curve since it satisfies ⟨f ′, f ′⟩= 0.\nWe obtain the following result:\nProposition 2.2.2. Let X : Ω→R3 be a minimal surface defined on a simply\nconnected parameter domain Ω⊂C, and X∗be the adjoint surface of X, then the\nholomorphic curve f : Ω→C3 defined by\nf(w) = X(w) + iX∗(w),\nw ∈Ω\n(2.13)\nis an isotropic curve.\nConversely, if f : Ω→C3 is an isotropic curve, then\nX(u, v) = Rf(w),\nX∗(u, v) = If(w),\n, w = u + iv\n(2.14)\ndefineds two minimal surface.\nCorollary 2.2.3. We say X∗(u, v), w = u + iv ∈Ωis an adjoint surface to some\nX(u, v), u + iv ∈Ωif there exists an isotropic curve f : Ω→C3 such that the Eq.(\n2.14) is satisfied.\n2.3\nAssociate Minimal Surfaces\nWe have shown that minimal surfaces can ben represented by the real parts of isotropic\ncurves in C3. We can now modify the isotropic curves slightly to give rise to a family\nof minimal surfaces that were discovered by Bonnet.\nGiven a isotropic curve f(w) = X(w) + iX∗(w) where w = u + iv ∈Ωand\n⟨f ′(w), f ′(w)⟩= 0, we can define another holomorphic function\ng(w, θ) = e-iθf(w),\nw ∈Ω.\n(2.15)\n\nIt is easy to see that g(w, θ) is an isotropic curve, and\nZ(w, θ) = Re-iθf(w) = X(w) cos θ + X∗(w) sin θ\n(2.16)\ndefines a one-parameter family of minimal surfaces such that\nZ(w, 0) = X(w),\nZ(w, π\n2 ) = X∗(w).\n(2.17)\nSince\nZu = Xu cos θ -Xv sin θ,\nZv = Xv cos θ + Xu sin θ,\n(2.18)\nwe have\n∥Zu∥2 = ∥Zv∥2 = ∥Xu∥2 = ∥Xv∥2\n(2.19)\nand thus\n⟨dZ(·, θ), dZ(·, θ)⟩= ⟨dX, dX⟩.\n(2.20)\nTherefore, all associate minimal surfaces to a given minimal surface have the same\nfirst fundamental form, i.e. they are isometric to each other.\nIf we denote f ′ = Φ = (Φ1, Φ2, Φ3), then we have from Eq. (??) that\nZ(w, θ) = R\nZ w\nw0\ne-iθΦ(w)dw.\n(2.21)\nIn the Weierstrass-Ennerper representation, we then have a \"Weierstrass function\",\nF(w, θ), for the family given by\nF(w, θ) = e-iθF(w).\n(2.22)\nIn other words, if F(w) is the Weierstrass function to a minimal surface X, then\niF(w) is the Weierstrass function to the corresponding adjoint surface.\n\n2.4\nBehavior of Asymptotic Lines and Curvature\nLines in a Family of Associate Minimal Sur-\nfaces\nLet ω(t) = (α(t), β(t)) be a C1 curve in Ω, t ∈[-ε, ε], then\n- ω(t) is an asymptotic line of X if and only if\ne α2 + 2f α β + g β2 = 0.\n(2.23)\n- ω(t) is a line of curvature of X if and only if\n(eF -fE) α2 + (Eg -Ge) α β + (gF -fG) β2 = 0\n(2.24)\nIn an isothermal parametrization, we have e = -g and E = G, thus the asymptotic\nlines are described by\ne( α2 - β2) + 2f α β = 0\n(2.25)\nand the curvature lines are characterized by\nf( α2 - β2) -2e α β = 0\n(2.26)\nIf we introduce a complex valued quadratic form Ξ( w):\nΞ( w) = l(w)( α + i β)2,\nl(w) = e(w) -if(w) = ⟨f ′′(w), N(w)⟩,\n(2.27)\nthen the asymptotic lines and the curvature lines are given by\nR{Ξ( w)} = 0\nand\nI{Ξ( w)} = 0\n(2.28)\nor equivalently\nR{l(w)(dw)2} = 0\nand\nI{l(w)(dw)2} = 0\n(2.29)\n\nNow if we consider a holomorphic function\nl(θ) = e(θ) -if(θ) = ⟨g′′(·, θ), N⟩\n(2.30)\nwhich characterizes the asymptotic lines and the curvature lines of the associate\nminimal surface Z(·, θ). Since g′′(w, θ) = e-iθf ′′(w), we have\nl(θ) = e-iθl(0) = [e cos θ -f sin θ] -i[e sin θ + f cos θ]\n(2.31)\nwhere l(0) = l = e -if is the characteristic function for X = Z(·, 0). If we set\nξ\n= e( α2 - β2) + 2f α β,\nη\n= -f( α2 β2) + 2e α β,\n(2.32)\nthen we have\nl(0)( α + i β)2\n= ξ + iη\nl( π\n2)( α + i β)2\n= η -iξ\n(2.33)\nSince X = Z(·, 0) and X∗= Z(·, π\n2), we showed that the asymptotic lines of X are\nthe curvature lines of X∗, and the curvature lines of X are asymptotic lines of X∗.\nWe can now express the results of this section in terms of the function F(w) in\nthe Weierstrass-Ennerper Representation. In doing so, we would like to express the\ncharacteristic function l(w) = ⟨N, f ′′⟩= e -if in terms of the functions μ, ν and F\nin the representation.\nConsider an isotropic curve f : Ω→C3 that is related to a minimal surface\nX(w), w ∈Ωby the formula\nX(w) = R{f(w)}.\n(2.34)\nWe obtain from the first Weierstrass-Ennerper representation that\nf ′ = Xu -iXv =\nμ1\n2μ(1 -ν2), i\n2μ(1 + ν2), μν\n¶\n.\n(2.35)\n\nν\nΩ\nX\nN\nΩ*\nσ\nFigure 2-1: The map ν\nIf we set g = (-ν, iν, 1), we obtain\nf ′′ = Xuu -iXuv = μ′\nμ f ′ + μν′g\n(2.36)\nFrom Eq. (2.11), let Φ = (Φ1, Φ2, Φ3) = f ′, then we have\nXu = RΦ,\nXv = IΦ.\n(2.37)\nThen we can obtain\nXu ∧Xv = I(Φ2 Φ3, Φ3 Φ1, Φ1 Φ2)\n(2.38)\nand consequently\nN =\n∥Φ∥2I(Φ2 Φ3, Φ3 Φ1, Φ1 Φ2) =\n1 + ∥ν∥2(2Rν, 2Iν, ∥ν∥2 -1).\n(2.39)\nIt is easy to see that ⟨N, g⟩= -1 and ⟨N, f ′⟩= 0. Combining Eqs. (2.36) and\n(2.39), we have\nl = e -if = ⟨N, f ′′⟩= -μν′.\n(2.40)\nBy comparing the representation formulas in Eqs. (2.1) and (2.3), we note that\none representation can go over into another one if we set μ(w) = 2F(w) and ν(w) = w\nand we then have three ways to characterize asymptotic lines and curvature lines, as\nshown in Table 2.1.\n\nTable 2.1: Characterization of Asymptotic Lines and Curvature Lines in Different\nRepresentation of Minimal Surfaces\nAsymptotic Lines\nCurvature Lines\nRemarks\nRl(w)(dw)2 = 0\nIl(w)(dw)2 = 0\nl = e -if\nR{μ(γ)ν′(γ) γ2} = 0\nI{μ(γ)ν′(γ) γ2} = 0\nγ(t) = α(t) + iβ(t)\nRF(w)(dw)2 = 0\nIF(w)(dw)2 = 0\n2.5\nCatenoid and Helicoid\nCatenoid is obtained by rotating a catenary about the z-axis in R3. A catenary has\nthe form\nx = α cosh\nμz -z0\nα\n¶\n(2.41)\nfor z ∈R, and z0, α are arbitrary constants with α = 0. If we set z0 = 0, then the\ncatenoid X(u, v) can be parametrized by\nx(u, v)\n= α cosh u cos v\ny(u, v)\n= -α cosh u, sin v\nz(u, v)\n= αu\n(2.42)\nwith -inf< u < infand 0 ≤v < 2π. By the following formulas\ncosh(u + iv)\n= cosh u cos v + i sinh u sin v\nsinh(u + iv)\n= sinh u cos v + i cosh u sin v\n(2.43)\nwe find that the catenoid can be written as X(w) = Rf(w) if we set the isotropic\ncurve f to be\nf(w) = (α cosh w, αi sinh w, αw)\n(2.44)\nIn order to find the Weierstrass function F(ω) of the catenoid such that\nx\n= α + R\nR ω\n1 (1 -ω2)F(ω) dω\ny\n= R\nR ω\n1 i(1 + ω2)F(ω) dω\nz\n= R\nR ω\n1 2ωF(ω) dω\n(2.45)\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFigure 2-2: The bending process from catenoid to helicoid\n\nwe introduce a new variable ω = e-w = e-u-iv. We know that ω can be represented\nin polar form ω = reiθ. Then log ω = log r + iθ = -u -iv. Thus the representation\nof catenoid in Eq. (2.42) can be written as\nx\n= α\nμ1\nr + r\n¶\ncos θ\n= Rα\nμ 1\nω + ω\n¶\ny\n= α\nμ1\nr + r\n¶\nsin θ\n= Riα\nμ 1\nω -ω\n¶\nz\n= -α log r\n= -Rα log ω.\n(2.46)\nComparing the expression for z in Eq. (2.42) and (2.46), we have\n-d\ndωα log ω = 2ωF(ω)\n⇒\nF(ω) = -α\n2ω2\n(2.47)\nFrom Eq. (2.44), we obtain the expression for the adjoint surface X ∗(w) = If(w)\nof the catenoid:\nx∗(u, v)\n= α sinh u sin v\ny∗(u, v)\n= α sinh u cos v\nz∗(u, v)\n= αv.\n(2.48)\nIf we write\nX∗= αY (v) + sinh uZ(v)\n(2.49)\nwith\nY (v) = (0, 0, v),\nZ(v) = (sin v, cos v, 0),\n(2.50)\nwe see that for every v ∈R, the curve X∗(·, v) is a straight line which meets the\nz-axis perpendicularly. If we fix u = 0, then X∗(u, ·) describes a helix. Therefore the\nsurface X∗is called a helicoid, the adjoint of the catenoid X.\n\n2.6\nScherk's Second Surface\nScherk's second surfaces Y (ω) are defined by\nx\n= α + R\nR ω\n1 (1 -ω2)F(ω) dω\ny\n= R\nR ω\n1 i(1 + ω2)F(ω) dω\nz\n= R\nR ω\n1 2ωF(ω) dω\n(2.51)\nwith the Weierstrass function\nF(ω) = -(α -iβ)\n2ω2\n(2.52)\nwhere α, β ∈R, α2 + β2 = 0. Thus, Scherk's second surface is an associate surface\nof the catenoid. Specifically, for α = 0 or β = 0, we obtain a helicoid or a catenoid\nrespectively. If we represent ω by e-w = e-u-iv, then the Scherk's second surface can\nbe expressed in a parameterized form\nx\n= α cosh u cos v + β sinh u sin v\ny\n= -α cosh u sin v + β sinh u cos v\nz\n= αu + βv + γ.\n(2.53)\nIf we represent a catenoid by\nXcat(w) = (cosh u cos v, -cosh u sin v, u)\n(2.54)\nand a helicoid\nXhel(w) = (sinh u sin v, sinh u cos v, v)\n(2.55)\nwith γ = 0, then we can write\nX(w) = c[cos θXcat(w) + sin θXhel(w)]\n(2.56)\n\nwhere α = c cos θ, β = c sin θ and c =\np\nα2 + β2. This clearly shows that the Scherk's\nsecond surface is nothing but an associate surface of the catenoid.\n2.7\nThe Enneper Surface\nA minimal surface X(w), w ∈C with a Weierstrass representation\nF(w) ≡1\n(2.57)\nis called an Enneper Surface. Using the Weierstrass-Enneper representation, we\nhave\nX(w) = R\nμ\nw -w3\n3 , iw + iw3\n3 , w2\n¶\n.\n(2.58)\nThus the components of X(u, v) are given by\nx\n= u -1\n3u3 + uv2\ny\n= -v -u2v + 1\n3v3\nz\n= u2 -v2\n(2.59)\nwhere w = u + iv ∈C.\nThe associate surfaces of the Enneper surface, Z(w, θ), is given by\nZ(w, θ) = R\n1⁄2\ne-iθ\nμ\nw -w3\n¶\n, ie-iθ\nμ\nw + w3\n¶\n, e-iθw2\n3⁄4\n.\n(2.60)\nWe will show that the trace of the Enneper surface is congruent to the traces of its\nassociate surfaces. Let us define a set of new cartesian coordinates ξ, η, z which is a\nrotation of the set x, y, z about the z-axis with an angle -θ\n2:\nξ + iη = e-iθ\n2 (x + iy).\n(2.61)\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFigure 2-3: The Enneper Surface and it's associate minimal surface\n\nThus the new coordinates of the associate surface will be\nη(w) + iη(w) =\ne-iθ/2[R(e-iθw) + iR(ie-iθw)]\n+e-iθ/2 h\nR\n¡\n-1\n3e-iθw3¢\n+ iR\nie-iθ w3\ni\n(2.62)\nIf we denote ζ = e-iθ/2w, then Eq. (2.62) becomes\nξ + iη = R(ζ -1\n3ζ3) + iRi(η + 1\n3η3).\n(2.63)\nRearranging, we have\nξ\n= R(ζ -1\n3ζ3)\nη\n= Ri(ζ + 1\n3ζ3)\nz\n= Rζ2\n(2.64)\nwhich is identical to Eq. (2.58) with a change of variables.\n\nChapter 3\nBj orling's Problem\nGiven a real-analytic curve c : I →R3 with c(t) = 0, and a real-analytic vector field\nn : I →R3 along c such that ∥n(t)∥≡1 and ⟨ c(t), n(t)⟩≡0, the Bj orling's problem\nconcerns about whether one can find a minimal surface X : Ω→R3 with I ⊂Ωsuch\nthat\n- X(u, 0) = c(u)\n- N(u, 0) = n(u)\n3.1\nSolution to the Bj orling's Problem\nTheorem 3.1.1. For any prescribed real-anlytic strip S = {c(t), n(t) : t ∈I}, the\ncorresponding Bj orling problem has exactly one solution X(u, v) given by\nX(u, v) = R\n1⁄2\nc(w) -i\nZ w\nw0\nn(w) ∧ c(w) dw\n3⁄4\n(3.1)\nwhere w = u+iv ∈Ω, u0 ∈I, and Ωa simply connected domain with I ⊂Ωin which\nthe power series expansions of both c and n are convergent.\nIn Eq. (3.1), we determine holomorphic extensions c(u + iv) and n(u + iv) of the\nreal-analytic functions c(t) and n(t), t ∈I, to a suitable simply connected domain Ω\n\nthat contains I and then determine the line integral\nZ w\nu0\nn(w) ∧c′(w) dw\nwhere c′(w) is the complex derivative of the holomorphic function c(w).\nProof. Let us first prove the uniqueness of the solution. Suppose X(u, v) is a solution\nof Bj orling's problem, defined in the simply connected domain Ω, and let X ∗: Ω→R3\nbe an adjoint surface to X with X∗(u0, 0) = 0 and u0 ∈I. Then the function\nf(w) = X(u, v) + iX∗(u, v),\nw = u + iv ∈Ω\n(3.2)\nis an isotropic curve with X = Rf, and\nf ′ = Xu + ix∗\nu = Xu -iXv.\n(3.3)\nSince Xv = N ∧Xu, we have\nf ′ = Xu -iN ∧Xu\n(3.4)\nwhich means\nf ′(u) = c(u) -in(u) ∧ c(u).\n(3.5)\nIntegrating both sides,\nf(u) = c(u) -i\nZ u\nu0\nn(t) ∧ c(t) dt\n(3.6)\nfor all u ∈I. Since both sides are holomorphic function of w, then both sides must\nagree on the whole plane, thus\nf(w) = c(w) -i\nZ w\nu0\nn(w) ∧ c(w) dw\n(3.7)\nfor w ∈Ω. Therefore any possible solution to X must be in the form of Eq. (3.1),\n\nwhich show the uniqueness.\nNow we will show that Eq. (3.1) is the solution to Bj orling's problem. Consider\nthe holomorphic curve f : Ω→C3 defined in Eq. (3.7). For w ∈I,\nRf ′(w) = c(w),\nIf ′(w) = -n(w) ∧ c(w).\n(3.8)\nSince c(w) is orthogonal to c(w) ∧n(w), we have\n⟨f ′(w), f ′(w)⟩= 0\nfor all w ∈I, and thus for all w ∈Ω. Therefore X(u, v) = Rf(w) is a minimal\nsurface. Since c(w), n(w) and c′(w) are real for w ∈I,\nX(u, 0) = Rf(u) = c(u)\n(3.9)\nand\nXu(u, 0) -iXv(u, 0) = f ′(u) = c(u) -in(u) ∧ c(u)\n(3.10)\nfor u ∈I. Moreover,\nXv(u, 0) = N(u, 0) ∧Xu(u, 0)\n(3.11)\nSince\n⟨Xu(u, 0), Xv(u, 0)⟩= 0,\n⟨n(u), c(u)⟩= 0,\n∥N(u, 0)∥= ∥n(u)∥= 1,\n(3.12)\nwe have\nN(u, 0) = n(u)\n(3.13)\nProposition 3.1.2. If the curve c(t) is contained in the xz-plane, c(t) = (ξ(t), 0, ζ(t)),\nwith a unit normal vector field N(t), then the solution to Bj orling's problem is given\n\nby\nX(u, v) =\nμ\nRξ(w), I\nZ w\np\nξ′(w)2 + ζ′(w)2 dw, Rζ(w)\n¶\n(3.14)\nProof. Since c′(t) = (ξ′(t), 0, ζ′(t)), the unit normal is\nN = (-ζ′, 0, ξ′)\np\nξ′2 + ζ′2\n(3.15)\nThen N ∧c′ = (0,\np\nξ′2 + ζ′2, 0). Hence\nR\nμ\nc -i\nZ\nN ∧c′\n¶\n=\nμ\nRξ, I\nZ p\nξ′2 + ζ′2 dw, Rζ\n¶\n.\n(3.16)\n3.2\nCatalan Surface\nA Catalan surface is obtained by solving the Bj orling's problem to find a minimal\nsurface that contains a cycloid such that the surface normal conincides with the\ncycloid's principal normal vector. A cycloid is the curve generated by a point P on\nthe circumference of a circle with center C rolling along a straight line.\nA cycloid on the x -z plane can be written as\nc(t) = (1 -cos t, 0, t -sin t).\n(3.17)\nLet the Catalan surface be X(u, v). Then by Eq. (3.14), we have\nx(u, v)\n= R(1 -cos z)\nz(u, v)\n= R(z -sin z)\n= 1 -cos u cosh v\n= u -sin u cosh v\n(3.18)\nTo compute y(u, v), we have c(w) = (sin w, 0, 1 -cos w) and\nsin2 w + (1 -cos w)2 = 4 sin2 w\n2 .\n(3.19)\n\n(a) A cycloid\n(b) A cycloid contained in a Catalan's\nsurface\nFigure 3-1: A Catalan's surface solve the Bj orling's problem of a cycloid\nThus\nZ q\nsin2 w + (1 -cos w)2 dw = -4 cos w\n(3.20)\nSince I(-4 cos w\n2 ) = 4 sin u\n2 sinh v2, we come to the espression of the Catalan's surface:\nX(u, v) =\n1 -cos u cosh v, 4 sin u\n2 sinh v2, u -sin u cosh v\n\n(3.21)\nFrom Eq. (3.21), we infer that our Catalan surface is\nX(u, v) = Rf(w)\n(3.22)\nwhere the isotropic curve f(w) is given by\nf(w) =\nμ\n1 -cosh(iw), 4i cosh\nμiw\n¶\n, w + i sinh(iw)\n¶\n(3.23)\n\nTherefore, the adjoint surface X∗(u, v) of Catalan's surface is given by\nx∗\n= sin u sinh v\ny∗\n= 4 cos u\n2 cosh v\nz∗\n= v -cos u sinh v.\n(3.24)\n3.3\nHenneberg Surface\nThe Henneberg surface is obtained by solving the Bj orling's problem for the Neil's\nparabola\n2x3 = 9z2\n(3.25)\nwhich can be parameterized by\nc(t)\n= (x(t), 0, z(t))\n= (cosh(2t), 0, -sinh t + 1\n3 sinh(3t)).\n(3.26)\nBy using Eq. (3.14), we have\nx(u, v)\n= R(cosh(2w) -1)\nz(u, v)\n= R(-sinh w + 1\n3 sinh(3w))\n= -1 + cosh 2u cos 2v\n= sinh u cos v + 1\n3 sinh 3u cos 3v\n(3.27)\nTo obtain y(u, v), first note that c(w) = (2 sinh 2w, 0, -cosh w + cosh 3w), thus\nI\nR p\nξ′(w)2 + ζ′(w)2 dw\n=\nI\nR p\n2 cosh2 2w -4 + cosh2 w -2 cosh w cosh 3w + cosh2 3w dw\n=\nI\nR\nsinh 3w + sinh w dw\n=\nI\n¡ 1\n3 cosh 3w + cosh w\n¢\n=\n3 sinh 3u sin 3v + sinh u sin v\n(3.28)\n\n(a) Neil's parabola\n(b) A Neil's parabola contained in a Hen-\nneberg surface\nFigure 3-2: A Henneberg surface solve the Bj orling's problem of a Neil's parabola\nTherefore, the Henneberg surface has a representation\nx\n= -1 + cosh 2u cos 2v\ny\n= -sinh u sin v -1\n3 sinh 3u sin 3v\nz\n= sinh u cos v + 1\n3 sinh 3u cos 3v.\n(3.29)\nThe isotropic curve f(w) that gives rise to the Henneberg surface X(u,v) with\nX(u, v) = Rf(w)\nis given by\nf(w) =\nμ\n-1 + cosh 2w, i cosh w + i\n3 cosh 3w, sinh w + 1\n3 sinh 3w\n¶\n.\n(3.30)\n\nThus the adjoint surface X∗to X is given by\nx∗\n= sinh 2u sin 2v\ny∗\n= cosh u cos v + 1\n3 cosh 3u sin 3v\nz∗\n= -cosh u sin v + 1\n3 cosh 3u sin 3v.\n(3.31)\nWe would like to show that the Henneberg surface is not orientable. Consider the\nEq. (3.29), we can see that\nX(u, v)\n= X(-u, v + π)\nXu(u, v) = -Xu(-u, v + π)\nXv(u, v) = Xv(-u, v + π)\n(3.32)\nfor all u + iv ∈C. The curve\nω(t) = (2t -1, π(t -1\n4)),\n0 ≤t ≤1\n(3.33)\njoins some point (u, v) with (-u, v + π). Then the curve ξ(t) = X(ω(t)), 0 ≤t ≤1\nis a closed regular loop on Henneberg's surface. But since N(ω(0)) = -N(ω(1)), so\nwe will return to the initial point if we move around the loop ξ(t), but the surface\nnormal N(ω(0)) will change to its opposite. This shows that the Henneberg's surface\nis a one-sided surface.\n\nChapter 4\nMore Applications of Bj orling's\nProblem\nThe solution to Bj orling's problem can be used to show some symmetry properties of\nminimal surface. In this chapter, we will show that straight lines and planar curves\nare lines of rotational symmetry and or mirror symmetry respectively. We will also\ndiscuss briefly about the Schwarzian chain problem, which is to find a minimal surface\nthat are bounded by straight arcs and planar curves.\n4.1\nSymmetry of Minimal Surface\nThe solution to the Bj orling's problem also reveals some of the symmetry principles\nof minimal surfaces. We start with the following corollory of Theorem 3.1.1:\nCorollary 4.1.1. Let X(u, v) be the solution to the Bj orling's problem given by Eq.\n(3.1), then we have\nX(u, -v) = R\n1⁄2\nc(w) + i\nZ w\nw0\nn(w) ∧ c(w) dw\n3⁄4\n,\nw = u + iv.\n(4.1)\nProof. Let X(u, v) = X(u, -v). Then X(u, v) is a minimal surface with the normal\n\nN(u, v) = -N(u, -v). Therefore, X(u, v) solves the Bj orling's problem for the strip\nS = {(c(t), -n(t)) : t ∈I}\nand thus\nX(u, -v) = R\n1⁄2\nc(w) + i\nZ w\nw0\nn(w) ∧ c(w)\n3⁄4\n.\nProposition 4.1.2. Let X(u, v) = (x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)), w = u + iv ∈Ωbe a\nnonconstant minimal surface whose domain of definition Ωcontains some interval I\nthat lies on the real axis.\n1. If, for all u ∈I, the points X(u, 0) are contained in the x-axis, then we have\nx(u, -v)\n= x(u, v)\ny(u, -v)\n= -y(u, v)\nz(u, -v)\n= -z(u, v)\n(4.2)\n2. If the curve Σ = {X(u, 0) : u ∈I} is contained in the xy-plane E, and if the\nsurface X intersects E orthogonally at Σ, i.e. the normal field N(u, 0) is also\ncontained in the xy-plane, then it follows that\nx(u, -v)\n= x(u, v)\ny(u, -v)\n= y(u, v)\nz(u, -v)\n= -z(u, v).\n(4.3)\nWe call such Σ a plane curve.\nProof.\n1. Let c(u) = (c1(u), 0, 0), n(u) = (0, n2(u), n3(u)), then\nn(u) ∧ c(u) = (0, c1(u)n3(u), - c1(u)n2(u)).\n2. We have\nc(u) = (c1(u), c2(u), 0),\nn(u) = (n1(u), n2(u), 0),\n(4.4)\n\nand thus\nn(u) ∧ c(u) = (0, 0, n1(u) c2(u), -n2(u) c1(u)).\n(4.5)\nThus, we have proved the following theorem:\nTheorem 4.1.3 (H. A. Schwarz).\n1. Every straight line contained in a minimal\nsurface is an axis of symmetry of the surface.\n2. If a minimal surface intersects some plane E perpendicularly, then E is a plane\nof symmetry of the surface.\n4.2\nStraight Lines and Plane Curves in Minimal\nSurfaces\nIn this section we will prove that straight lines and plane curves are asymptotic lines\nand curvature lines respectively on a regular surface.\nTheorem 4.2.1. Let X : Ω⊂C →R3 be a C3 regular surface, ω(t), t ∈I ⊂R be a\nC3-curve in Ω, w = u+iv ∈Ω. Then c(t) = X(ω(t)) is a regular curve in the surface\nX, and\n1. The curve c is both a geodesic and asymptotic line if and only if it is a straight\nline.\n2. Let c be a geodesic. Then c is a line of curvature if and only if it is a planar\ncurve.\nProof. Let the parameter t coincides with the arc length s. Denote {T (s), S(s), R(s)\nbe a moving orthogonal frame along c(s), where T (s) is the tangent vector, R(s) =\nN(ω(s)) is the surface normal, and S(s) = R(s)∧T (s) is the side normal. MOrevoer,\nlet N(s) be the principal normal and B(s) = T (s) ∧N(s) be the binormal vector\nalong the curve c(s).\n\nThe vector T satisfies the relation\nT = κgS + κnR\n(4.6)\nwhich is explained in the Appendix A.\n1. If c is both a geodesic and asymptotic line, then κg = 0 and κn = 0. Then Eq.\n(A.2) gives T = 0, which means that c(s) is a straight line. Conversely, if c(s)\nis a straight line, then T (s) ≡0, which implies that κg(s) ≡0 and κn(s) ≡0.\n2. If c(s) is a geodesic, then κg = 0 and T will be parallel to R. Since T = κN,\nwe have N(s) = ±R(s). For a planar curve, the vectors T (s) and N(s) are on\nthe same plane for all s, thus B ≡0. Now\nB = T ∧N + T ∧ N = κN ∧N + T ∧ N\n(4.7)\nor\nB = T ∧ R\n(4.8)\nSince R(s) lies on the tangent plane Tω(s)X, we have\nR = γ1T + γ2S\n(4.9)\nand thus\nB = γ2R\n(4.10)\nTherefore, B ≡0 if and only if γ2 ≡0, or R(s) = γ1(s)T (s). Therefore c(s) is\na planar curve if and only if c(s) is a line of curvature.\nCombining the results from Chapter 2, we have the following proposition:\nProposition 4.2.2. Let X : Ω⊂C →R3 be a nonconstant regular minimal surface\nand X∗: Ω→R3 be an adjoint minimal surface of X. Both X and X∗has the\n\nsame normal mapping N : Ω→S2. Let also that ω : I ⊂R →Ωbe a C3-curve\nwith ω(t) = 0. Then c = X *ω and c∗= X∗*ω are two C3-curve in X and X∗\nrespectively. Moreover, c and c∗has the same spherical image γ = N *ω.\n1. Let c(t) be contained in some straight line L. Then c(t) is both an geodesic and\nasymptotic line in X, and thus γ(I) is contained in some great circle C in S2.\nMoreover, c∗is a planar geodesic of X∗.\n2. If c(t) is a planar geodesic in X, or it is contained in the orthogonal intersection\nof X with some plane E, then γ(I) lies in a great circle in S2. The curve c∗is\na straight arc, thus geodesic asymptotic, in X∗.\n4.3\nSchwarzian Chain Problem\nLet X : Ω0 →R3 be a nonconstant minimal surface, and Ωbe a simply connected\nsubdomain such that Ω⊂Ω0.\nSuppose also that the Gauss map N : Ω→S2\nis injective, and the boundary of X(Ω) consists of finitely many straight lines and\nplanar geodesics, i.e. orthogonal intersections of X with planes. In other words, the\nminimal surface is spanned into a frame C = {Li, Ej}, i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, . . . , n where\nLi's are straight lines and Ej's are planes. The set C is called a Schwarzian Chain ,\nand we say that the surface X is a minimal surface that solves the Schwarzian chain\nproblem for the chain C. Note that X is perpendicular to all planar parts of the chain\nC. In this section, we will show how to construct the Weierstrass function F(w) of\nthe surface X given a chain C.\nNow consider the map\nΩ\nX(u,v)\n-→X\nN\n-→S2\nσ\n-→Ω∗\n(4.11)\nSince straight lines and planar curve are geodesics in X, they will be mapped to great\ncircles by the Gauss map N : Ω→S2. Now consider the meromorphic function ν in\n\nthe Weierstrass-Enneper Representation\nω = ν(w), ω ∈Ω∗, w ∈Ω.\n(4.12)\nThe map is biholomorphic since\n1. N(w) is not the north pole;\n2. N is injective.\nAs stereographic projection maps circles on S2 to circles in Ω0. Therefore, the image of\nstraight lines and planar curves in the Schwarzian chain C under the map ν : Ω→Ω∗\nconsists of circular arcs. Since the map ν is biholomorphic, we define τ = ν-1 such\nthat τ(ω) = w. Therefore we can find a function F(ω) such that\nX(w)\n= Y (τ(ω)) = R\nR ω\nω0 Φ(ω) dω\nΦ\n= [(1 -ω2)F(ω), i(1 + ω2)F(ω), 2ωF(ω)]\n(4.13)\nDefine the function l(w) = e(w) -if(w) which characterizes asymptotic lines and\ncurvature lines and\np(w) =\nZ w\nw0\np\nl(w) dw\n(4.14)\nfor some fixed w0 ∈Ω. Since p′(w) =\np\nl(w), then the map\nζ = p(w)\n(4.15)\nis a conformal mapping of Ωonto some domain Ω∗∗in the ζ-plane. Note that\ndζ = p′(w) =\np\nl(w)(dw)2.\n(4.16)\nAs asymptotic lines are given by Rl(w)(dw)2 = 0, and Il(w)(dw)2 = 0 characterizes\nthe curvature line, so the ζ images of asymptotic lines intersect the real axis at an\nangle π/4 or 3π/4, and the curvature lines are straight lines that are parallel to either\nthe real axis or the imaginary axis.\n\nFor the minimal surface X : Ω→R3 that solves a Schwarzian chain C that consists\nof asymptotic and curvature lines, the map ζ = p(w) maps Ωonto some polygonal\ndomain Ω∗∗in ζ-plane.\nIf we compose τ : Ω∗→Ω∗∗with the map p : Ω→Ω∗∗, then the map q = p *τ :\nΩ∗→Ω∗∗is conformal. Then\nq(w) = p(τ(ω))\n=\nR ω\nω0\np\nl(τ(ω))τ ′(ω) dω\n=\nR ω\nω0\np\n-μ(τ(ω))ν′(τ(ω))τ ′(ω)2 dω\n=\nR ω\nω0\np\n-2F(ω) dω\n.\n(4.17)\nTherefore\nF(ω) = 1\nμdq(ω)\ndω\n¶2\n(4.18)\nFrom our assumptions, the map τ : Ω∗→Ωis 1-1. If we choose a branch in Ω\nsuch that the map p : Ω→Ω∗∗is 1-1, then q = p *τ is a biholomocphic bijective\nmapping of Ω∗into Ω∗∗, and the extension of the mapping into Ω∗maps the vertices\nof the circular polygonal domain in Ω∗into the vertices of the polygonal domain Ω∗∗.\nTherefore we have found a method to solve the Schwarzian chain problem by explicit\nformulas.\n\nChapter 5\nExploring Minimal Surfaces Using\nComputer Programs\nComputer programs provides visualization of minimal surfaces, and thus are useful\nin understanding some of the concepts in the minimal surface theory. In this chapter,\nwe will show how to use Maple to draw minimal surfaces using the Weierstrass-\nEnneper representations. Another program called \"Evolver\" can be used to solve the\nSchwarzian chain problem using the area-minimizing principle.\n5.1\nMaple and Minimal Surfaces\nThis section is based on [5] which provides an excellent descriptin of how to use Maple\nto illustrate concepts about minimal surfaces.\nAccording to Eq. (2.1), we can construct minimal surfaces if we have a holomor-\nphic function μ and a meromorphic function ν to generate minimal surfaces. On the\nother hand, a holomorphic function F can also be used to serve the same purpose by\nEq. (2.3).\nWe begin by opening a blank Maple worksheet and type in\n> with(plots):\nwith(linalg):\nWe will make sure that Maple understands the difference between complex vari-\nables z and real variables u and v by entering\n\n> assume(u, real); additionally (v,real); additionally (t,real); is(u, real);\nis(v, real);\ntrue\ntrue\nThe following sub-procedure returns the complex integrals of the Weierstrass-\nEnneper representation:\n> Weierz := proc(F)\nlocal Z1, Z2, Z3, Z;\nZ1 := int(F(1-z^2), z);\nZ2 := int (I * F * (1+z^2), z);\nZ3 := int (2\nF\nz , z);\nZ := [Z1, Z2, Z3];\nend:\nBelow is a procedure in Maple to generate minimal surfaces using μ and ν. The\ntwo functions are called f and g respectively in the procedure. There is a variable\ncalled a in the procedure, which is used to simplified the expression by changing the\nvariable z to ez if we set a = 1, and z to e-iz/2 when z = 2. When a is set to any\nvalue other than 1 or 2, then the procedures would not use any substitution for z.\nWeierfg := proc(f, g, a)\nlocal Z1, Z2, X1, X2, X3, Z3, X;\nZ1 := int(f*(1-g^2), z);\nZ2 := int(I * f* (1+g^2), z);\nZ3 := int(2*f*g, z);\nif a=1 then Z1 := subs(z = exp(z), Z1); Z2 := subs (z = exp(z), Z2); Z3\n:= subs(z = exp(z), Z3) fi;\nif a=2 then Z1 := subs(z = exp(-I*z/2), Z1);\nZ2 := subs(z = exp(-I*z/2), Z2); Z3 := subs(z = exp(-I*z/2), Z3) fi;\nX1 := simplify(convert(simplify ( Re(evalc(subs(z = u+I*v,\nexpand(simplify(Z1))))), trig), trig), trig);\n\nX2 := simplify(convert(simplify ( Re(evalc(subs(z = u+I*v,\nexpand(simplify(Z2))))), trig), trig), trig);\nX3 := simplify(convert(simplify ( Re(evalc(subs(z = u+I*v,\nexpand(simplify(Z3))))), trig), trig), trig);\nX := [X1, X2, X3];\nend:\nSimilarly the procedure Weier is written for the Weierstrass-Enneper representa-\ntion II:\nWeier := proc(F,a)\nlocal Z1,Z2,X1,X2,X3,Z3,X;\nZ1 := int(F*(1-z^2),z);\nZ2 := int(I*F*(1+z^2), z);\nZ3 := int(2*F*z,z);\nif a=1 then Z1 := subs(z = exp(z), Z1); Z2 := subs (z = exp(z), Z2); Z3\n:= subs(z = exp(z), Z3) fi;\nif a=2 then Z1 := subs(z = exp(-I*z/2), Z1); Z2 := subs(z = exp(-I*z/2),\nZ2); Z3 := subs(z = exp(-I*z/2), Z3) fi;\nX1 := simplify(convert(simplify ( Re(evalc(subs(z = u+I*v,\nexpand(simplify(Z1))))), trig), trig), trig);\nX2 := simplify(convert(simplify ( Re(evalc(subs(z = u+I*v,\nexpand(simplify(Z2))))), trig), trig), trig);\nX3 := simplify(convert(simplify ( Re(evalc(subs(z = u+I*v,\nexpand(simplify(Z3))))), trig), trig), trig);\nX := [X1, X2, X3];\nend:\nWith the two procedures Weierfg and Weier, we can plot minimal surfaces easily\nby choosing appropriate functions. For example, since we know that F =\n2z2 for\ncatenoid and F =\ni\n2z2 for helicoid, we can plot these two surfaces by typing the\nfollowing in the Maple prompt:\n> Weier(1/2*z^2), 1);\n\n[-cos(v) cosh(u), -sin(v) cosh(u), u]\n> plot3d(Weier(1/(2*z^2), 1), u=-1..1, v=0..2*Pi);\nFigure 5-1: F(z) =\n2z2\nFor the helicoid, we need a little more steps.

Brakke. One of the function of\nthe program is to minimize the area of a surface with a given boundary. Since an\narea-minimizer is a minimal surface, this program provides a way to generate minimal\nsurface in a convenient way. Particularly it is useful to to solve the Schwarzian chain\nproblem, since the boundary of such a problem is easy to be entered to the program.\nSurface Evolver can also minimize other specified energies over the surface, and it\nemploys a gradient descend method. More information can be found in [2] and [1].\nIn this section, we will contend ourselves by showing some surfaces that are gen-\nerated using the Surface Evolver program.\n\nFigure 5-8: F(z) = z2\nFigure 5-9: F(z) = sin z\n\nFigure 5-10: F(z) = z4\nFigure 5-11: F(z) =\nz4\n\nFigure 5-12: Trinoid: f(z) -\n(z3-1)2, g(z) = z2\nFigure 5-13: F(z) = i( 1\nz + 1\nz2 -1\nz3)\nFigure 5-14: f(z) =\nz2, g(z) =\nz2\n\nFigure 5-15: f(z) =\nz2, g(z) =\nz3\nFigure 5-16: f(z) = z, g(z) = z3\nFigure 5-17: f(z) = i(z+1)2\nz4\n, g(z) = z2(z-1)\nz+1\n\nFigure 5-18: A minimal surface solving the Bj orling's problem for a parabola z = x2.\nFigure 5-19: A minimal surface solving the Bj orling's problem for a z = ln(x).\n\nFigure 5-20: Schwarz' D Surface\nFigure 5-21: Schwarz' P Surface\n\nAppendix A\nSome Basic Differential Geometry\nIn this appendix we will review some of the basic theory in differential geometry about\nasymptotic lines, curvature lines and geodesics. Readers are referred to [3] for more\ndetailed study.\nA.1\nGeodesic Curvature and Normal Curvature\nLet ω : I ⊂R →Ω⊂C be a regular curve parametrized by arc length s, and X(u, v)\nbe a regular surface where w = u + iv ∈Ω. Then c(s) = X(ω(s)) is a regular curve\nin the surface X. Denote T (s) to be the tangent vector ω(s), R(s) to be the surface\nnormal N(ω(s)), and S(s) = R(s) ∧T (s) be the side normal along the curve ω, then\nwe have a moving orthogonal frame\n{T (s), S(s), R(s)}\n(A.1)\nalong the curve ω(s).\nWe can also define another frame {T (s), N(s), B(s)} where T (s) = κ(s)N(s), κ(s) =\n∥ T (s)∥and B(s) = T (s) ∧N(s). The vector N(s) is called the principal normal vec-\ntor, and B(s) is called the binormal vector.\nSince the curve c is parameterized by arc length, we have ⟨T , T ⟩= 0 and thus\nD\nT , T\nE\n= 0. Since {T (s), S(s), R(s)} form an orthogonal basis, we know that T (s)\n\ncan be written as a linear combination of S and R:\nT = κgS + κnR\n(A.2)\nwhere kappag is the geodesic curvature and κn is the normal curvature.\nThe definition of κn in Eq.\n(A.2) coincides with the definition given in [3]1.\nMoreover, c(s) is said to be a asymptotic line if κ(s) = 0 for all s ∈I.\nThe value κg in Eq. (A.2) can be used to define geodesics.\nDefinition A.1.1. The curve c(s) is a geodesic if the covariant derivative of c′(s),\nDc′(s)/ds vanishes for all s ∈I.\nThe covariant derivative of c′(s) can be defined as the projection of dc/dt onto the\ntangent plane, and c′(s) = T (s). Let θ be the angle between N and R, then\ncosθ = ⟨N, R⟩.\nSince T lies on the plane spanned by R and S and R is perpendicular to the\ntangent plane, we have\nDT (s)\nds\n= 0 ⇔\nD\nT , S\nE\n= 0 ⇔κg = 0\n(A.3)\n1See page 141 in [3]\n\nBibliography\n[1] K.

      "content": "Characterizations of Complete Embedded Minimal Surfaces: Finite\nCurvature, Finite Topology, and Foliations\nMichael Nagle\nMarch 15, 2005\nIn classifying minimal surfaces, we start by requiring them to be complete and embedded. Having an\nembedding lets us work in real-space, and requiring completeness lets us focus on whole, nonextendable\nsurfaces instead of all possible subsets of these surfaces. From here we can look at the class of surfaces of\nfinite topological type, and the subclass of those surfaces with finite curvature. As conditions on curvature or\ntopology can be strong enough to uniquely determine a surface, fully understanding the relationship between\nfinite topology and finite curvature is useful in classifying complete, embedded minimal surfaces.\nI begin by introducing the catenoid and mentioning how it can be characterized by various conditions on\nits topology and curvature. I then explore the relationship between finite curvature and finite topology, and\noutline the recent result that finite curvature and finite topology are equivalent when a complete, embedded,\nminimal surface has at least two ends. Finally, I state two beautiful theorems of Schiffman which give us\nsome sufficient conditions for showing that a surface is foliated by convex curves, and prove one of these\ntheorems.\n\nR p\nR p\nFigure\n1:\nA\nhanging\ncable\nwith\nthe\nforces\nacting\non\nit\nshown.\nFrom\nhttp://www.mhhe.com/math/calc/smithminton2e/cd/folder structure/text/chap06/section09.htm\nMinimal Surfaces and the Catenoid\n1.1\nThe Catenoid\nThe catenoid is a surface obtained by rotating a catenary around the z-axis. It is the only minimal surface\nof revolution, and can also be characterized uniquely by other geometric or topological properties, like being\nthe only minimal surface foliated by Jordan curves. I will use the catenoid as an example of showing how\nwe can characterize a minimal surface through purely geometric and topological properties. First I derive\nthe equation for the catenary from the physical description that the catenary is the curve formed by a cable\nhangle from two poles at equal height.\nLet our hanging cable be be given by a function f(t), and assume the cable has linear density ρ. The\nlowest point of the catenary is set to be the origin. Denote the horizontal tension pulling the cable, at the\norigin, to the left by H. Since the cable is not moving, all forces must be in equilibrium (see Figure 1.) The\n′\nhorizontal equilibrium yields H = T cosθ, and the vertical equilibrium yields ρ ·\n1 + f (t)2dt = T sinθ\n(noting that the left-hand side of this equation is the curve's weight, which is the density of the curve times\nits length.)\n′\nMultiplying the equation for horizontal equilibrium by tanθ, we get Htanθ = ρ ·\n1 + f (t)2dt.\n\nFigure 2: The catenoid. From http://www.gang.umass.edu/gallery/min/mingallery0101.html\nThe above force diagram shows us that tanθ is f ′(x), so Hf ′(x) = ρ · R p\n1 + f ′(t)2dt. Differentiating\nyields Hf ′′(x) = ρ ·\np\n1 + f ′(x)2, which can be rewritten as\nR\n(f ′′(x)/(1 + f ′(x)2))dx =\nR\n(ρ/H)dx. Thus\nsinh-1(f ′(x)) = (ρ/H)x + c.\nHaving set x = 0 as a minimum for the catenary, f ′(0) = 0 and thus c = 0. Setting H/ρ = a, we conclude\nthat f(x) = acosh(x/a), which is the general equation for a catenary.\nRotating this curve (with a = 1) around the z-axis provides a parameterization of the catenoid x from a\ndomain U ⊂R2 to R3: x(u, v) = (bcoshvcosu, bcoshvsinu, bv)\n1.2\nMinimal Surfaces of Revolution\nA surface is minimal if the mean curvature H = (k1 + k2)/2 is zero everywhere, where k1 and k2 are the\nprincipal curvatures. A surface with an isothermal parameterization can be shown to be a minimal surface\nif and only if its coordinate functions are harmonic. Using the given parameterization, this criterionshows\nthat the catenoid is minimal. Furthermore, the catenoid can be shown to be the only minimal surface of\nrevolution. I show this here by using Stoke's flux equation.\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nR\nR\nZ\nZ\nLet S be a minimal surface given by an isometric immersion X : S → R3 . Stoke's theorem states that\nfor any C2 function f : S → Rn ,\nΔfdA =\ndf(n)ds\n(1)\nS\nδS\nwhere n is the outward pointing conormal to S\n∗\nSetting n = dX(n), the image of the outward-pointing conormal, we get\n∗\nΔfdA =\nn ds.\n(2)\nS\nδS\n∗\n∗\nAs S is minimal, ΔX = 0 and thus\nδS n = 0. Equivalently,\nn · vds = 0.\nδS\nThis last equation can be interpreted as looking at the flux through the boundary δS with constant\nvelocity vector v.\nNow take a minimal surface of revolution, obtained by rotating a curve r(t) around the z-axis. Set S\nto be the subset bounded by the z-planes z = t1 and z = t2 (for t1 > t2) and define α(t) to be the angle\nbetween the tangent plane to S at z = t and the z-plane z = t.\nThe boundary of S is two circles in the z = t1 and z = t2 planes. By using the flux equation for a\nminimal surface with v = (0, 0, 1) to compute the flux in the z-direction through S, we find\nsinα(t1)ds =\nsinα(t2)ds.\n(3)\nS∩{z=t1}\nS∩z=t2\nand so 2πr(t1)sinα(t1) = 2πr(t2)sinα(t2). Since t1 and t2 are arbitrary, we can write r(t)sinα(t) = c.\nThis gives us the ODE:\n\nr(t)p\n= c.\n(4)\n′\n1 + r (t)2\nThis is solved by\ncosh(At + B)\nr(t) =\n,\n(5)\nA\nfor real numbers A = 0 and B, which is the general equation for a catenoid.\n1.3\nBasic Properties about the Catenoid\nWe have just seen that requiring a minimal surface to be a surface of revolution forces it to be the catenoid.\nSimilarly, specifying a minimal surface's total curvature and/or topological type appropriately will again\nensure that the surface is the catenoid. For example:\n* The only properly embedded, non-planar, minimal surface with genus zero is the catenoid. [?]\n* The only properly embedded minimal surface with total curvature -4π is the catenoid. [?]\n* The only properly embedded minimal surface with two ends and finite curvature is the catenoid (loosely,\nan end is an unbounded portion of the catenoid that lies outside of a compact subset.) [?]\n* The only properly embedded minimal surface which forms a Jordan curve when intersected with any\nz-plane is the catenoid (this is the generalized Collin-Nitsche theorem, which will be discussed shortly.)\nThese facts illustrate the power of specifying topological or geometric conditions of a surface, as a few\ngiven parameters on a minimal surface can uniquely determine the entire surface. This makes notions of\ntopology and curvature very useful when attempting to classify all complete, embedded, minimal surfaces.\n\nR\nFinite Topology and Finite Curvature\nIn this section, I will discuss the notions of finite topology and finite curvature, and discuss both how they\nare related to one another as well as how they connect to the classical problem of the Nitsche Conjecture. I\nbegin by defining these notions and then describe a few surfaces with and without finite curvature.\nA surface has finite topology if it is homeomorphic to a compact surface with a finite number of\npoints removed. An end of a surface is the image of a small disk neighborhood around a removed point\nof the compact surface under this homeomorphism. A surface has finite curvature if\nS KdA is finite\n(equivalently, if the surface area of the image of the Gauss map is finite.)\nAs a basic example, let's look at the catenoid, which has both finite topology and finite curvature. The\ncatenoid's image under the Gauss map is all of the sphere except for its north and south poles, and because\nthe Gauss map is 1-to-1 for the catenoid, this shows that it has finite topology. The image of a small disk\naround the north or south pole of the sphere under the inverse of the Gauss map corresponds to the top\nand bottom of the catenoid, so the catenoid has two ends, each going off to infinity. The catenoid has finite\ncurvature since the Gauss map covers the sphere, with the exception of its poles, once and so the total\ncurvature is -4π.\nWhile the use of the Gauss map in the example of the catenoid shows a strong relationship between\nnotions of finite curvature and finite topology, it's also easy to see that the two properties are not equivalent.\nConsider the example of the helicoid. The helicoid is obtained by taking a helix and ruling it along the\nxy-plane. We can parameterize it by x(u, v) = (vsinu, vcosu, u).\nThe helicoid is simply-connected, as we can deformation retract the helicoid onto a helix, and then\ndeformation retract that to a point. That means that the helicoid has the same topological type as a sphere\nminus a point, and thus has finite topology. However, as the helicoid is periodic and winds around the z-axis\ninfinitely many times, it doesn't have finite curvature, as the Gauss map covers the sphere (minus its poles)\ninfinitely many times.\nA result of Osserman states that a complete minimal surface of finite curvature is conformally equivalent\nto a compact Riemann surface with a finite number of points missing (conformally equivalent means that\n\nFigure 3: The helicoid. From http://www.gang.umass.edu/gallery/min/mingallery0101.html\nthe homeomorphism between the two spaces is conformal.)\nThus finite curvature implies finite topology, but without additional conditions, as the example of the\nhelicoid shows, the converse is not true. Many additional requirements for a surface have been suggested,\nbased on the approach of finding a topological or geometric condition that ruled out the helicoid (pun\nintended) - the only known counterexample to the equivalence of finite curvature and finite topology. In\n[1], published in 1985, Hoffman and Meeks explored the conjecture that all complete, embedded, minimal\nsurfaces that are not simply-connected have finite topology if and only if they have finite curvature.\nA counter-example to this conjecture was produced in 1992 by Hoffman, Karchner, and Wei [?]. This\nwas the genus-one helicoid. The genus-one helicoid looks like the original helicoid on all turns but one, and\nthis turn contains a torus-like hole.\nThe genus-one helicoid is a counterexample to the conjecture that finite topology and finite curvature\nare equivalent even when restricting to the class of non-simply connected minimal embedded surfaces, as the\ngenus-one helicoid is not simply connected and has finite topology and infinite curvature.\nBoth the ordinary helicoid and the genus-one helicoid have just one end. Thus, looking at surfaces with\n\nFigure\n4:\nThe\ngenus\none\nhelicoid.\nFrom\nhttp://www.math.uni-\nbonn.de/peoplse/weber/research/minimal/notes/helicoid/\nat least two ends would eliminate both counterexamples, and in fact it turns out that finite topology is\nindeed equivalent to finite curvature for surfaces with at least two ends. I will now go through the major\nfacts used in this theorem, but will only state them in order to show how they connect to the equivalence of\nfinite topology and finite curvature for minimal surfaces with at least two ends. The main idea is to show\nthat this equivalence can be reduced to the recently proven generalized Nitsche Conjecture.\n2.1\nThe Nitsche Conjecture\nIn 1962, Nitsche showed that the only minimal annulus that meets every z-plane in a star-shaped curve is\nthe catenoid. (A star-shaped curve is one that bounds a star-shaped set. A star-shaped set is a set S that\nhas a point a ∈ S such that for all other points x ∈ S, the line from a to x is contained in S.) The Nitsche\nConjecture asked if this was also true for Jordan curves instead of star-shaped curves.\nIn light of a theorem of Schoen's, which says that the only complete embedded minimal surface with two\nends and finite total curvature is the catenoid, we can generalize the Nitsche Conjecture.\nTheorem (Collin-Nitsche Theorem): If A is a minimal annulus whose intersection with every z-plane\nis a Jordan curve, then A must have finite curvature.\nSince a minimal annulus has two ends, Schoen's theorem reduces this to the original Nitsche conjecture.\nThis had been a conjecture until proven by Collin in 1997 [?]. The explicit mention of finite curvature in\nthis generalizations establishes a link to showing under what conditions finite curvature and finite topology\nare equivalent.\n\nUsing a theorem of Meeks and Rosenberg, [?] we can reduce the statement that for surfaces with at least\ntwo ends, finite topology implies finite curvature.\nTheorem (Meeks/Rosenberg): Let S ⊂ R3 be a properly embedded minimal surface with more than\none end. If A is an annular end of M, then it is conformally diffeomorphic to the punctured disk.\nFrom looking at the images of rings on the punctured disk, we get\nCorollary: If S ⊂ R3 is a properly embedded minimal annulus, then after a rotation of R3, M intersects\nevery horizontal plane in a single closed curve.\nThus if S is a properly embedded minimal surface with at least two ends, each of its ends are annular\n(being homeomorphic to a punctured disk by definition) and so satisfy the hypothesis of the Collin-Nitsche\ntheorem, meaning they each have finite curvature. Assuming finite topology, we have finitely many ends\neach with finite curvature, so the total curvature of surface must be finite.\nFoliated Surfaces and Schiffman's Theorems\nThe prior discussion shows that looking at if and how a surface is foliated - what each intersection of the\nsurface with the z-plane is, for instance - can be a useful tool in verifying various geometric properties about\nsurfaces. We first take a look at the simplest example of a minimal foliated surface, the catenoid, and then\nstate Schiffman's theorems and prove one of them. These theorems tell us that a minimally immersed annulus\nis foliated by convex curves or circles when its boundary consists of convex curves or circles, respectively.\n3.1\nFoliation by Circles and the Catenoid\nThe catenoid is clearly foliated by circles: as it is a surface of revolution, every cross-section we look at along\nthe z-axis will be a circle. We can also show, through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and a characterization\ntheorem for the catenoid, that any complete minimal annulus foliated by circles must be the catenoid.\n\nR\nP\nR\nR\nThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem tells us that for a region R of an oriented surface S,\nZ\nZ\nX\nKdA = 2πχ(R) +\nβi +\nκgds\nR\ni=0\nδR\nwhere χ(R) is the Euler characteristic of the region R, βi is the i-th exterior angle of the corners made by\nthe boundary δR and κg is the geodesic curvature of δR. Often, the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem is presented for\nsurfaces without boundary, which gives us the (even more) elegant\nS KdA = 2πχ(S). This theorem's power\nlies in relating topological information of a surface to geometric information; the simple, immediate impli-\ncation from the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem that the total curvature of a surface is invariant under homotopic\ndeformations is a pretty startling result. (For more on the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, see [doCarmo], pages\n264 - 283.)\nNow take A to be a complete minimal annulus, fibred by circles, and R to be some compact subset of\nA. As R is compact and bounded by parallel circles, it is an annulus. An annulus has Euler charateristic\nzero. This can be seen by noting that an annulus is topologically a sphere minus two points. A standard\ntriangulation of the sphere is a tetrahedron, so applying the Euler characteristic formula to the tetrahedron\nwith two vertices removed, we get χ(R) = vertices -edges + faces = (4 -2) + 6 + 4 = 0. The\nβi terms\ni\namount to zero because the boundary of R is a pair of circles, neither of which have any corners. Finally,\nthe geodesic curvature of each circle contributes +/ -2π, so we get that |\nR KdA| ≤4π\nNow, it's been shown that the total curvature of a complete embedded minimal surface (and while we\ndid not explicitly state that A is embedded, it is because it is fibred by circles) must be a multiple of 4 π\n(for a surface S with genus k and r ends,\nKdA = -4π(r +k -1).) This means our surface could have total\ncurvature of 0, 4π, or -4π. Our surface is minimal, so it has non-positive Gaussian curvature everywhere,\nmeaning its total curvature is either 0 or 4π. Having total curvature zero would imply A was the plane, but\nit can't be because we are looking at a surface fibred by circles. Thus, the total curvature of A is -4π.\nUsing the characterization, also proved by Schoen [?], that the only complete and not simply connected\nsurface with total curvature -4π is the catenoid, we have shown that a minimal annulus fibred by circles\n\nmust be the catenoid.\nThis is also another proof that the only minimal surface of rotation must be the catenoid.\n3.2\nSchiffman's Theorems.\nSchiffman's theorems, from [?] tell us about the fibres of a minimally immersed annulus, given some basic\ninformation about the boundary of the annulus. They are best described by their statements.\nLet A be a minimally immersed annulus, and γ be the boundary of the annulus.\nTheorem [Schiffman]: If γ is a pair of smooth convex Jordan curves, sitting in parallel planes, then\nthe intersection of A with any plane parallel to and between those planes is a convex curve.\nAdditionally, Schiffman proved that for the same situation as above,\nTheorem [Schiffman]: If γ is a pair of circles, then every intersection of A with a plane is a circle.\nSchiffman's first theorem also implies that the surface A is actually embedded, as we have a foliation for\nit.\nWe now prove Schiffman's first theorem. First, we recall the maximum principle: a non-constant harmonic\nfunction u defined on an open region Ω attains its maximum and minimum on the boundary of Ω. Thus, a\nharmonic function is uniquely determined by its values on the boundary (for two harmonic functions f and\ng that agree on the boundary of Ω, their difference f -g must be zero everywhere as the maximum and\nminimum of f -g are zero.)\nAlso, we will use the notation that Pt denotes the z-plane where z = t.\nWe start our proof by noting that, through uniformization, any A is conformally equivalent to an annulus\nD(r) = {z ∈C|1 ≤|z| ≤r} for a unique r > 1. We can assume that our annulus A is the image of some\niθ)\nconformal minimal immersion X : D(r) →R3 where, using polar coordinates for D(r), X(re\n⊂Pln(r)\niθ)\n(and so X(e\n⊂P0, the xy-plane.) Since we are looking at a minimal immersion, we know that the third\ncoordinate function X3 is harmonic, and by the construction of X, X3 agrees with ln|z| on the boundary of\nA. As ln|z| is also harmonic, we can apply the maximum principle to conclude that X3 = ln|z|.\nNow, having written down X3, we know that the gradient of X3 is never zero on D(r), and so the tangent\n\nplane to the minimal annulus A is never horizontal. That means that the function g(z), the composition\nof the Gauss map with stereographic projection, is never zero or inf, and so φ = arg g(z)(mod2π) is well-\ndefined. Observe that the horizontal projection of the normal to A at a point p in the intersection Pt ∩A is\northogonal to the plane curve Pt ∩A at p and never zero. Thus, φ can also be considered as the angle of the\nnormal to the intersection Pt ∩ A.\niθ)\nThe convexity of a curve Pln(c) ∩ A (equivalently, the image of X on ceiθ) is equivalent to\nδ φ(ce\nδθ\nδ\nnever changing sign. The function g is analytic, and so δθ (argg) is harmonic, since this is true for analytic\nfunctions in general. As both boundary curves of A have the same orientation,\nδ φ has fixed sign on the\nδθ\nboundary δA. Thus, the max and min of φ both have the same sign, and φ can never be zero in the interior.\nThis means that our level curves of A are all convex, and so we have shown our result.\nFor a proof of Schiffman's second theorem, see his paper [?]\nReferences"

Introduction\nThe \"Plateau's Problem\" is the problem of finding a surface with minimal area among all\nsurfaces which have the same prescribed boundary. Let x be a solution to Plateau's problem\nt\nfor a closed curve Γ and let xt be a variation of x such that x0 = x and x has the boundary\nΓ for all t. If A(t) is the area of x(t) bounded by Γ then A0(0) = 0 since t = 0 is a minimum\nfor A. A surface is minimal if it is a critical point of the area function for each closed curve\nthat it spans. A piece of a minimal surface bounded by a closed curve (or a family of closed\ncurves) is called stable if the surface is a minimum for the area function associated with that\ncurve. It is called unstable if it is a local maximum.\nIt is readily seen that minimal surfaces don't necessarily minimize area. Therefore it is\nnatural to ask when a minimal surface is area minimizing. This is in general a difficult\nproblem since it is hard to analyze the area function. Even analyzing the area function and\nfinding its global minimum does not suffice if the boundary is a family of closed curves(see\n4.2). In this paper we describe Schwarz's theorem which gives sufficient conditions for a\nminimal surface to be unstable thus not area minimizing. Schwarz's theorem states that\nif the smallest eigenvalue λ of the laplacian of the Gaussian image of a piece of a minimal\nsurface is greater than two then the piece is unstable. A result due to J. L. Barbosa, M. do\nCarmo in the converse direction states that if the mentioned eigenvalue is less than two then\nthe piece is stable. Notice however that even these results together leave the case λ = 2 open.\nSection 2 introduces the notation that we use and also provides the background information\nneeded. Section 3 gives an elementary proof to a corollary of Schwarz's theorem. Section 4\npresents a nice application of this corollary and also describes a class of examples to which this\ncorollary does not apply. Section 5 gives an outline of the proof of Schwarz's theorem. This\npaper is mainly based on Michael Oprea's book The Mathematics of Soap Films: Explorations\nwith Maple, 2000 and the paper On the Size of a Stable Minimal Surface in R3 .,J. L.

So φ provides enough information for us to determine the surface.\nThis observation gives us a recipe to construct minimal surfaces: find a holomorphic φ sat\nisfying 2.3.2 then integrate to obtain the surface. A nice way to construct such a φ is the\nfollowing:\nφ1 = f (1 - g2), φ2 = i f (1 + g2), φ3 = f g\nwhere f is holomorphic g is meromorphic and f g2 is holomorphic.

But by Douglas and Rad o we know that there is a solution to Plateau's problem for\nthe curve C. So there exists two minimal surfaces spanning C.\n4.2. Catenoid. Now consider the catenoid. It is known that the catenoid is the solution\nto Plateau's problem for two identical and parallel circles. On the other hand one might\nbegin with a catenoid and compare the areas of two disks with the area of the part of the\ncatenoid bounded by the circles. A Weierstrass-Enneper II representation of the catenoid is\nz\ngiven by T (τ) =\nIn order to simplify integrals choose τ = -e . For this choice of τ\n2τ 2 .\nz\nWeierstrass-Enneper data of catenoid is (f, g) = (- e\n2 , -ez ) Note that g never takes the value\n0. Therefore the domain of τ can never contain the unit disk. Letting z = u + iv gives\nx(u, v) = (cosh u cos v, cosh u sin v, u)\nEasy computation yields:\nE = cosh2 u = G, F = 0\nNow note that the image of the curve u = c corresponds to a disk with radius cosh c on the\nc\ncatenoid and a disk with radius e on τ plane. Therefore the part of the catenoid bounded\nby the circles with equal radii correspond to the infinite strip between u = c and u = -c on\nc\n(u, v) plane and the annulus bounded by the circles centered at origin of radii e and e-c on\n\nWHEN IS A MINIMAL SURFACE NOT AREA-MINIMIZING?\nτ plane. Simple calculus gives\nc\nZ\ncosh2 udu = π(e2c - e-2c + 8c)\nthe lateral area = 2π\n-c\nthe total area of two disks equals\nπ(e2c + e-2c + 2)\n2π cosh2 c =\nPlotting by matlab shows that the total area of the disks become smaller than the lateral\narea if c > 0.64. We finish this section by stating the conclusions that we draw from the\nabove discussion:\nGiven a surface with Weierstrass-Enneper data (f, g) with g holomorphic , theorem 3.1\ndoes not apply if the image of g does not contain the origin. It also does not apply if the\nimage of the Gauss map skips two antipodal points on the sphere.\n5. Schwarz's Theorem\nWe first introduce the notation and the background needed for Schwarz's theorem and then\nwe give an outline of its proof. Then we show that theorem 3.1 is a corollary of Schwarz's\ntheorem.\nLet M be a two-dimensional, orientable compact Cinf manifold. A domain D ⊂ M is an\nopen, connected subset with compact closure D and such that the boundary ∂D is a finite\nunion of piecewise smooth curves. Let x : M\nR3 be a minimal surface into the Euclidean\n→\nspace R3.(here we require x to be only piecewise smooth not necessarily smooth) By the\nconstruction of minimal surface equation we know that D is a critical point of the area for\nall variations of D which keep ∂D fixed. When this critical value is a minimum for all such\nvariations, we say that D is stable.\nNow we recall the formula for the laplacian operator on 2-manifolds in terms of the para\nmetrization (u1, u2):\n∂\n∂\nij\n(5.0.1)\nΔM =\nX\n∂ui (detG1/2 g uj )\ndetG1/2\ni,j=1\nWhere G is the matrix for the first fundamental form and (gij ) = G-1 . If we view a surface\nwith isothermal coordinates as a manifold 5.0.1 gives\n(5.0.2)\nΔM =\nΔ\nEM\n\nZ\nZ\nZ\n¤\nNIZAMEDDIN H. ORDULU\nWhere we have used EM to denote the E-coefficient of the first fundamental form of the\nmanifold M. Therefore (3.1.13) becomes\n(5.0.3)\nA00(0) =\nρ(-ΔM ρ + 2ρK)dM\nR\nWhere dM = Edudv is the area element of M. If A00(0) > 0 for all ρ (here we again assume\nthat ρ is only piecewise smooth) then D is stable. We say that D is unstable if for some ρ,\nA00(0) < 0.\nWe denote by H(D) the space of Cinf functions on D which are not identically zero and\nvanish on ∂D. We call a positive real number λ an eigenvalue in D for ΔM if there exists\nu ∈ H(D) such that ΔM u + λu = 0. The eigenspace associated with λ is\nPλ(D) = {u ∈ H(D) ΔM u + λu = 0}\n|\nIt is known that the eigenvalues form a discrete set of positive numbers. We denote the\nsmallest of them by λ1\nTheorem 5.1. (Schwarz's Theorem [BdC]) Let D ⊂ M be a domain and assume that\nthe Gauss map N, restricted to D is a branched covering onto N (D). Assume further that\nthe first eigenvalue for the laplacian ΔS2 in N (D) is smaller than two. Then D is unstable.\nProof. Let λ1 be the first eigenvalue for ΔS2 in N (D). Then there is a function u : S2\nR\n→\nsatisfying ΔS2 u + λ1u = 0 Note that N is a parametrization of N (D). Furthermore by (2.8.3)\nwe know that this parametrization is isothermal. By (2.8.3) and 5.0.2 we have\nΔS2 =\nΔ = -\nΔM .\n- EK\nK\nNow write u in terms of this new parametrization by letting f = u N.(Note here that f is\n*\nan eigenfunction of the laplace operator ΔS2 with eigenvalue λ1, since the laplace operator\ndoes not depend on the parametrization.) Then by the above equations we have\nΔM f = λ1Kf\nIf we compute the second derivative of the area for the normal variation f N we obtain\nA00(0) =\nf (-ΔM f + 2f K)dM =\nf 2(-K)(λ1 - 2)dM\nD\nD\nSince the integrand is always negative we deduce A00(0) < 0 hence D is not stable.\nFollowing lemma relates the first eigenvalues of two domains one contained in the other.\nWe refer the reader to [BdC] for its proof:\n\nWHEN IS A MINIMAL SURFACE NOT AREA-MINIMIZING?\n\nLemma 5.2. If D ⊂ D then λ1 ≥ λ1, and equality holds if and only if D = D. (λ 1, λ1 are\n\nthe first eigenvalues of D and D)\n5.2 makes sense since if u ∈ Pλ1 ( D) then one can extend u to a function in H(D) by letting\nu vanish outside D. Therefore λ1 is an eigenvalue of the Laplace operator in D. So the smallest\neigenvalue of D is less than or equal to that of D (one has to make a more careful analysis to\nshow that they are not equal). We show that 3.1 is a corollary of Schwarz's theorem.\nproof of 3.1 Let u : S2\nR be the restriction of the projection u(x, y, z) = z to S2 . It\n→\nis easy to verify that ΔS2 u + 2u = 0. Furthermore u = 0 on the great circle determined by\nz = 0. So the hemisphere has eigenvalue 2. By 5.2 any region that contains the hemisphere\nhas an eigenvalue less than two thus by 5.1, it is not stable. Q.E.D.\nNote here that if our surface is given by Weierstrass-Enneper Representation II then the\ncomposition of projection to third coordinate and the Gauss map is u +v -1 which explains\nu2+v2+1\nthe mystery behind the choice of the function ρ in the proof of 3.1.\nThere are other domains on the sphere that have 2 as the first eigenvalue. It is easily\nchecked that the restriction to S2 of\n(1 + z)\nuc,z (x, y, z) = 2 - z log (1 - z) + cz, z = 1, 0 ≤ c < inf\nis a solution to ΔS2 u + 2u = 0. It is easy to see that there are two zeros z1, z2 of u as a\nfunction of z. If C is the ring shaped domain on the sphere bounded by the circles z = z1 and\nz = z2 then Schwarz's theorem can be applied using C instead of hemisphere. One can also\nconstruct other domains with first eigenvalue two by considering the linear combinations of\nuc,x, uc,y , uc,z . We finish the paper by quoting the following companion of Scwarz's theorem\nfrom [BdC]:\nTheorem 5.3. (do Carmo and Barbosa) Let D ∈ M be a domain and assume that the\nfirst eigenvalue λ1 of N(D) is greater than two. Then D is stable.\nReferences\n[Osserman] Robert Osserman, A Survey of Minimal Surfaces, (2002).\n[Oprea] John Oprea, The Mathematics of Soap Films: Explorations with Maple, (2000).\n[BdC] J. L.
