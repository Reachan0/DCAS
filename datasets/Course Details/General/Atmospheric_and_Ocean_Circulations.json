We will assume familiarity with concepts covered in courseÂ 12.003 (Physics of the Fluid Earth). In the early stages of the present course, we will make somewhat greater use of math than did 12.003, but the math we will use is no more than that encountered in elementary electromagnetic field theory, for example. The focus of the course is on the physics of the phenomena which we will discuss.",

TIDES\nFigure 4.8: Tidal co-range and co-tidal lines for the North Sea.\nIn the presence of coasts, the tide takes on the characteristics of the\nkelvin wave. Thus, the tide will tend to propagate anticlockwise around\namphidromic points in northern hemisphere ocean basins, and clockwise in\nthe northern hemisphere. Locally, this effect may be counteracted by the\ntendency of the \"open ocean\" tide to follow the moon westward, and by\ninteraction between adjacent amphidromic points.\n4.2.5\nTides in inlets and bays\nSimilar behavior is seen on a smaller scale in smaller bodies of water. Figure\n4.8 shows the tide in the North Sea. Note the large amplitude, as compared\nwith typical open ocean values, and the similar anticlockwise propagation\naround the coasts. The propagation is much slower here, consistent with the\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\n\nImage removed due to copyright considerations.\nImage removed due to copyright considerations."
