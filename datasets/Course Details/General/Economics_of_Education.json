  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nRecitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis course combines economic theory, econometric literature and institutional literature to examine current issues in U.S. education. Topics include (but will not be limited to): The basic theory of investments in education (human capital theory); the empirical problem of disentangling the return to education from the return to innate ability; the role of education in national economic growth; the association between education and individual earnings and reasons why that relationship has changed over time; the role of early childhood education; the main approaches to K-12 school reform (money, choice, educational standards, and teacher selection/training); and the problem of increasing access to higher education. Along the way, we will discuss computers both in their effect on educational requirements and their potential role in teaching skills. We will also discuss the role of education in individual mobility and in national growth.\n\nClass Participation (Three Kinds)\n\nAn education course is a good place to try to improve your education. In particular, I want you to engage with the material and minimize \"chalk and talk\" where I do all the talking and you sit in your seats taking notes, doing email, etc. We are going to institute two or three procedures to help push in this direction:\n\nOn the first day of class, we will decide whether we will choose one student each day to take class notes. If we adopt this system, the notes will then be distributed electronically to other students in the class. This should allow other students to focus more on class discussion. No student will be asked to do the notes for more than one class and a student who takes notes will be exempt from questions for the next class (see below).\n\nBeginning with the second class, each student should bring to class two good questions they have developed about that day's readings. Students will hand in the questions at the beginning of class and the first part of each class will involve me calling on four or five students and using their questions to begin the day's discussion. I will grade each pair of questions as Exceptional, Satisfactory, or Unsatisfactory. When a student cannot attend class, they should email their questions to me on the morning of the class.\n\nPolicy debates to be held in section. Many issues we discuss involve significant controversy - e.g. the effect of increased spending or school choice on student achievement. To clarify these issues, we will hold a series of 25 minute student debates in Friday sections. Students will sign up in advance and we will try to give every student the opportunity to participate.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nProblem sets\n\n20%\n\nMid-term\n\n25%\n\nFinal exam\n\n35%\n\nClass and recitation participation\n\n20%\n\nPeter will run the weekly section meeting and hold office hours. The first two section meetings will present the basic econometrics needed to read many of the course readings. Subsequent sections will expand on material in class and will hold assigned student debates on various topics.\n\nPrerequisite\n\n14.01 or its equivalent is required and 14.30 or its equivalent is recommended. Students who have no experience with basic econometrics can fill in their background in the first section meetings (see above).",

Primary schools enrolled in PEC received a\n5-year grant of $15,000 for supplies and teacher skill development and free\ntraining for the principal. PEC also requires school staff and parent\nassociations to become actively involved in drafting a plan for school\nimprovement. In principle, every primary school may participate; in practice,\nabout 10% did by the 2003 - 04 school year. The program specifically targets\ndisadvantaged urban schools through an advertising campaign.\nYou have a data set that tells you the dropout rate (the proportion of\nstudents who did not return to school in the following year) at 74,701 primary\nschools in each year from 2000 - 01 to 2003 - 04. Of these schools, 1767\nbecame enrolled in PEC at the beginning of 2001 - 02, an additional 7477\nbecame enrolled by the beginning of 2003 - 04, and 65,457 were still not\nenrolled by the end of the period covered. (You can assume that once a\nschool becomes enrolled, it stays with the program for 5 years.) You want to\nestimate the effect of participation in PEC on a school's dropout rate.\na. (5 points) Someone suggests that you look at the 1767 schools that\nwere enrolled in 2001 - 02 and compare their dropout rate in\n2000 - 01 to their dropout rate in 2003 - 04. Do you think this is a\ngood approach? Explain why or why not.\nAnswer: No, it is not. This approach confounds the effect of PEC\nwith the effects of any other factors that are changing over time. For\nexample, dropout rates may be changing in response to\nimprovements in the economy or other programs that affect\nschools.\nb. (5 points) Someone else suggests that you compare the 1767\nschools that had been receiving PEC from the start to the 65,457\nschools that never enrolled, and take the difference in their\n2003 - 04 dropout rates as the effect of PEC. Do you think this is a\ngood approach? Explain why or why not.\nAnswer: No, it is not. The schools that enrolled in PEC are clearly\nnot equivalent to the non-PEC schools in every respect except for\ntheir participation in PEC. It is unclear in which direction this\ncomparison is biased, however. On the one hand, the PEC schools\nhad sufficient motivation (from staff and parents) to enroll in the\nprogram, and urban schools were targeted (urban schools very\nlikely have lower dropout); these factors suggest that the PEC\nschools would have lower dropout even without PEC. On the other\nhand, the PEC schools felt they had some need to enroll and\ndisadvantaged schools were targeted; these factors suggest that\n\nthe PEC schools would have higher dropout without PEC. Even\nthough we can't be sure in which direction this approach is biased,\nthere is little reason to believe that it correctly estimates the causal\neffect of PEC.\nc. (10 points) Using this data set, devise your own research strategy\nto estimate the effect of PEC on dropout. Be precise in describing\nhow you will calculate your estimate.\nAnswer: You likely want to do some kind of difference-in-differences\ncomparison, but there is more than one reasonable answer. The\nsimplest approach is to calculate the change in the dropout rate\nover 2000 - 01 to 2003 - 04 for the 1767 schools that enrolled initially\nand the 65,457 schools that never enrolled. The difference between\nthese changes would be our estimate of the causal effect of PEC.\nAlternatively, you could use the 7477 schools that enrolled later as a\ncontrol group and calculate changes in the dropout rate over\n2000 - 01 to 2001 - 02. The advantage of this strategy is that the\ncontrol group likely corresponds more closely to the treatment\ngroup, since both eventually enroll in PEC; the disadvantages are\nthat the sample size is smaller (so standard errors will be larger)\nand we have to measure the change in dropout over a single year\n(which might make PEC look less useful than it really is if some of\nits effects take a while to kick in).\nd. (5 points) Even though you believe your strategy in (c) to be a good\none, it probably requires some assumptions in order to be valid.\nExplain the conditions under which your approach in (c) would give\nyou a misleading estimate of the causal effect of PEC.\nAnswer: The key assumption, if you answered\ndifference-in-differences in (c), is that the underlying trend in\ndropout must be the same across treatment and control schools.\nThat is, absent PEC, the schools that enrolled in PEC would have\nhad the same change in dropout rates as the schools that didn't\nenroll.\nYou do NOT need to assume that assignment to PEC is essentially\nrandom. If we had a true experiment here, then there would be\nnothing wrong with the method outlined in part (b); random\nassignment means that, absent PEC, the level of dropout would be\nthe same in treatment and control schools.\n2. (21 points) You want to estimate the return to an additional year of\nschooling, but you are concerned about ability bias. Consider each of the\nfollowing empirical approaches, and explain why or why not you think it\nwould solve the ability bias problem and correctly estimate the return to\nschooling:\na. (7 points) You have data on each person's state of birth. You\n\nregress average earnings of people born in state s on average\nyears of schooling for people born in state s.\nAnswer: This removes ability bias if we believe that average ability\nis the same across high-education and low-education states. This\ncould be false if high-ability parents tend to move to places like\nMassachusetts or New York, where they have high ability children.\nEven if we believe that average ability is the same across states,\nthis approach probably does not correctly estimate the return to\neducation. High education states tend to be much more urban and\nhave higher costs of living; these considerations will push up\nearnings there.\nSome people read this question as proposing to estimate a\nstandard earnings regression with data on individuals, but including\nonly individuals born within one state (s). I'm not sure how the\nreferences to \"average earnings\" can be interpreted in that context,\nbut I didn't dock marks for interpreting the question that way as long\nas you had a good explanation.\nb. (7 points) You find a data set on twins. You regress an individual's\nearnings on his or her years of schooling, controlling for the\nindividual's age and the twin's years of schooling.\nAnswer: This certainly controls for ability to some extent, especially\nif the twins are identical and grew up in the same household.\nHowever, consider exactly what this approach is doing. Suppose\nwe have individuals A and B with 18 and 12 years of schooling\nrespectively (assume they are the same age). We know that Aâ² s\ntwin (AT) and Bâ² s twin (BT) each have 16 years of schooling. This\napproach is saying that the earnings difference between A and B\ncan be attributed entirely to the schooling difference between A and\nB, because the fact that AT and BT have the same years of\neducation means that we have controlled for ability. However, there\nare at least two problems with this inference:\ni. On average, Aâ² s family has higher years of schooling than\nBâ² s family (17 versus 14 years). It is natural to infer that\ngenetic and family background characteristics are \"better\"\nin Aâ² s family.\nii. The fact that A achieved a higher level of schooling than\nhis twin suggests that he might be higher ability than his\ntwin. Obviously if the twins are identical and grew up\ntogether, they must have the same genes and family\nbackground, but A may have had life experiences that\nmade him more motivated or more interested in pursuing a\nhigh-profile career.\n\nThe upshot is that this method likely controls for ability to\nsome extent, but not fully. This was a hard question, and\ngrading was largely based on the justification you gave for\nyour answer.\nc. (7 points) You have data on the Socio-Economic Status (SES) of\neach person's parents. You regress earnings on years of schooling\nand age, and you instrument years of schooling with parental SES.\n(If you're confused about instrumental variables, try looking at the\neconometrics notes for recitation again.)\nAnswer: This is a horrible instrument! Parental SES very likely has\na direct effect on earnings apart from its effect on education: e.g.,\nhigh SES parents may teach their kids more outside the formal\nschool system or may give their kids access to better job networks.\nThis violates one of the two key assumptions necessary for the IV\nstrategy.\n3. (24 points) Read \"How Experts Differ From Novices.\" The author lists six\ncharacteristics of experts.\na. (12 points) To what extent do you think changes in technology have\nincreased demand for these expert characteristics? (One paragraph\nis sufficient. The last two characteristics may not be relevant.)\nAnswer: Answers will vary. A 12/12 answer made specific reference\nto some of the expert characteristics (not just experts in a general\nsense) and mentioned specific ways in which technology has (or\nhas not) increased demand for workers with this characteristic. A 9\nor 10 means a \"good\" answer.\nFor example, experts' knowledge of a subject area is organized\naround a set of \"big ideas\" that they use to determine how to attack\na problem (characteristic #2). Novices may be able to solve a\nproblem once they have slotted it into a category, but they have a\nharder time determining which category is correct (characteristic\n#3). Computers are similar to novices in this way. Once the\nuniverse of possible answers is well defined, computers are very\nefficient at searching this universe for the right answer. However, it\nis very difficult to design a simple algorithm for choosing the\nappropriate universe in the first place; experts use a large number\nof clues in the statement of a problem, some of which may conflict\nwith one another, and aggregate them to determine the problem's\nmost likely category. The problem is made worse by the fact that\nexperts cannot even articulate what their procedure is\n(characteristic #5). Thus the development of computers has\nsubstituted for novice workers and increased the relative demand\nfor experts.\n\nb. (12 points) Consider the teaching of algebra in 8th or 9th grade, a\nsubject most people would classify as problem solving. Does all of\nthis subject matter qualify as \"expert problem solving\" in the sense\ndefined by the chapter? Does any part of the subject matter qualify?\nExplain why teaching the kinds of skills involved in \"expert problem\nsolving\" may be harder than teaching basic algebra. (Again, one\nparagraph is sufficient and the last two characteristics may not be\nrelevant.)\nAnswer: Once a problem has been transformed into equations, the\nequations can be solved by applying simple, articulable rules; this\ndoes not qualify as expert problem solving. The transformation of a\nproblem in words into a set of equations is certainly closer to expert\nproblem solving, since there is often no easy algorithm that tells a\nstudent whether two numbers should be added, subtracted,\nmultiplied, or divided. Poorly designed algebra problems, however,\nmay allow students to set up the equations by application of rote\nrules (e.g., if the problem mentions two numbers and uses the word\n\"sum\" in the final question).\nIt is relatively difficult to teach expert problem solving skills precisely\nbecause the skills involved cannot be enunciated in a set of simple\nand articulable rules. Teachers cannot tell students how to solve\nalgebra problems like an expert; instead, they must know what\nexperiences are most likely to give students an intuitive\nunderstanding of which method to apply to a given context.\n4. (30 points) Consider the following model: there is a very large number of\nworkers, and they vary uniformly in their lifetime productivity between 0 and\n1. If we label each worker by her productivity y, this means that the average\nlevel of productivity for workers in the interval y, y is\ny\nydy\ny - y\ny\nEach worker decides whether or not to go to college before entering the\nworkforce. A worker chooses to go to college if the increase in lifetime\nearnings is greater than her monetary and psychological cost; the cost for a\nworker of productivity y is cy 1 - y. That is, more productive workers have\na lower cost of going to college. Going to college doesn't affect productivity\nfor a given individual.\nEmployers can't observe anything directly about a person's productivity.\nIn fact, for the purposes of the model they never observe an individual's\nproductivity until that person retires. All the employer can observe is whether\na person went to college. Thus they offer a wage w1 to people with a college\ndegree and a wage w0 to people without a college degree. Because of\ncompetition, the wage for a college-educated worker must equal the average\nlifetime productivity of people with a college degree, and the wage for people\n\nwithout college must equal their average lifetime productivity.\na. (8 points) There will be some cutoff y such that workers above y go\nto college and workers below y don't. Find w1 and w0 as a function\nof y.\nAnswer: We know that w1 is the average productivity of workers\nabove y, so\nw1 1 -\n1 y\ny ydy\n1 -\n1 y 2\n1 y2|1\ny\n\n1/2 1 - y 2\n1 - y\n1 y\n\nSimilarly,\n\nw0 1\ny\nydy\ny\n1/2 y 2\ny\n\ny\nb. (8 points) In making their schooling decisions, workers all want to\nmaximize the value of their wage minus their cost of going to\ncollege. Using this information, which workers will go to college in\nequilibrium? What is the wage premium for going to college\n(w1 - w0)?\nAnswer: We have w1 - w0 1/2 no matter the value of y. Since the\nworker at y must be indifferent between going to college or not, we\ncan conclude that y 1/2. That is, all workers with y 1/2 go to\ncollege, all workers with y 1/2 do not, and the worker with y 1/2\nis indifferent.\nc. (4 points) Suppose that we had cy 2\n1 for all workers instead.\nWhat would be the wage premium for going to college in that case?\nExplain why. (You shouldn't need to do any calculations.)\nAnswer: This is slightly confusing because if cy 1\n2 then in\nequilibrium no one would go to college. However, the idea is that if\nthe cost of college is constant, then it can't serve as a signal; if you\ngot that much, full marks. The \"hypothetical\" wage premium that a\nperson believes they could get by going to college must certainly be\nless than 2\n1 . We would expect it to be 0 because employers have\n\nno particular reason to believe that a renegade who went to college\nis more likely to be high ability than low ability.\nd. (5 points) Go back to the original model with cy 1 - y. We run an\nOLS regression to figure out the return to college from an\nindividual's perspective (i.e., how much more a given person could\n\nearn if she decided to go to college); call our estimate Do we\n\nexpect to overestimate the individual's return, underestimate it, or\nget it right?\nAnswer: It gets the individual return right. Even a person with y 0\ncan get a wage premium w1 - w0 in this model; she just doesn't\nwant to because going to school is too costly.\ne. (5 points) A government official is considering a program that would\nincrease college attendance by a proportion of the population. If\nhe uses the same regression as above and concludes that society\n\nwill be richer as a result of the program, is he overestimating the\nsocial benefit, underestimating it, or getting it right (from the\nperspective of this model)?\nAnswer: He is overestimating the benefit, because the true social\nbenefit is 0. Remember, no one's productivity increases by going to\ncollege-in this model, it would be efficient to prevent anyone from\ngetting a degree!"

      "content": "Problem Set 3\n11.126/11.249/14.48\nDue April 24, 2007 in class\nI. Class Size: Hanushek vs. Krueger (20 points)\nHanushek's literature review on the effects of class size suggests that there is no\nstrong association between class sizes and test scores in the United States. Table 6\nshows that across many (non-experimental) studies, small classes are associated with\nlower test scores as often as higher test scores. Table 7 shows that the same result\nholds for the relationship between class size and a student's improvementin test score\nover the course of the year. On the other hand, Krueger's paper on the Tennessee\nSTAR experiment found large gains from small class sizes.\n1. (10 points) Suppose that small class sizes really do have a substantial\neffect on student achievement, i.e., Krueger is right. How might you explain\nthe patterns summarized by Hanushek?\n2. (10 points) Now suppose that small class sizes don't have a very strong\neffect on achievement (on average), i.e., Hanushek is right. How might you\nexplain the findings of the STAR experiment if the average effect of class\nsize is negligible?\nII. Vouchers and School Choice (25 points)\nIn the readings on school choice and in our discussions in class, the focus has\nalways been on the effect of allowing a small number of children to enroll in the school\nof their choice (or their parents' choice). That is, we are looking at the effect of school\nchoice on an individual student, holding the school system as a whole approximately\nconstant. Imagine implementing a voucher program nation wide. Write a short essay\ndiscussing the additional effects such a program might have, effects that are not\ncaptured by small scale experimental studies. Do these effects make you more or less\ninclined to support a national voucher program?\nIII. Incentive and Accountability Systems (25 points)\n1. (10 points) In 1996, Chicago Public Schools instituted an accountability\nreform. An important element of the reform was to put poorly-performing\nschools on probation. Probation means that the school loses some of its\nautonomy, and if it fails to improve staff can be dismissed or reassigned to\nother institutions; it is something that teachers and administrators would\nstrongly like to avoid. The rule is that a school goes on probation if fewer\nthan 15% of its students perform at or above national norms (the national\nmedian) on a reading test, with students in Special Education programs\nomitted from the calculation. Discuss some of the \"perverse\" incentives of\n\nthis program, i.e., incentives that were probably not intended by the program\ndesigners. (I see four perverse effects.)\n2. (15 points) Suppose you are designing an incentive system for schools\nbased on their test scores. You can base your incentive scheme on one of\nthree measures: a) the raw average of test scores in a school (normed to the\npopulation at large); b) a school's change in average test score compared to\nthe same school's score last year; or c) a school's average test score minus\nthe school's \"predicted\" score, where the predicted score comes from a\nregression of test scores on student Socio-Economic Status, race, and other\nsimilar measures. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each\noption.\nIV. Policy Brief (30 points)\nYou are an education aid to Janet Napolitano, Governor of Arizona. Napolitano is a\nmoderate Democrat who respects both the government and markets. She believes\nstrongly that Arizona's future depends on improving the quality of the state's K-12\neducation. She is considering proposing either a demonstration voucher program\n(which could include private schools) or a demonstration public school open\nenrollment program. She has not yet decided on the size of the program and she is\nstill considering whether it should be run in one location or multiple locations. Before\nshe makes these decisions, she wants to better understand what such a program\nmight accomplish.\nEarlier today, the governor called you into her office and asked you to write a short\npolicy brief (approximately 600 words), based upon your reading, which summarizes\nwhat existing studies say about the effectiveness of a voucher program or an open\nenrollment program in raising student achievement and in improving school quality. If\nexisting studies contain important lessons about how to design a demonstration, you\nshould briefly include those lessons as well."

We\ndiscussed this in the beginning of the course when we examined whether better\neducational attainment in the population was an important determinant of\nproductivity growth - the determinant of rising living standards (it wasn't). Labor\nproductivity growth can create a situation like that shown in the data for this\nproblem: high school and college wages can both increase in absolute value even\nas they change relative to each other.\n\nb) The question refers to the data for 1969 and 1999 you were given in the problem.\nThe fact to explain is why, over the 30 years, high school and college wages have\nbecome relatively closer. We know from 14.01 (or the secretary example in\nclass) that this closing of the wage gap has two main explanations.\n\ni. A supply-side explanation is that the number of college graduates\nhas grown faster than the number of high school graduates - i.e.\nthe relative supply of college graduates has increased - while the\ndemand for each group remains stable.\nRelative price of\ncollege graduates\n(college wage\npremium)\nRelative\ndemand\nRelative\nsupply in\nRelative\nsupply in\n\nii. A demand -side explanation is that the relative demand for college\ngraduates falls while the relative supplies of the two groups remain\nstable.\n\nRelative price of\ncollege graduates\n(college wage\npremium)\nRelative\ndemand in\nRelative\nsupply\nRelative\ndemand in\n\nc) To distinguish between these two scenarios, you would need data on the supply of\ncollege and high school graduates to see whether the college graduates grew at a\nfaster rate (supply side explanation) or slower rate (demand side explanation) than\nhigh school graduates.\n\nd) This question was meant to refer to Staten Island, not the U.S. Thinking about\ncollege as investment involves both the benefits and costs of additional education.\nDue to the narrowing wage gap, the benefits must have narrowed. But college\ncould still be a better investment if the cost of education had sufficiently fallen,\neither because tuition fell or because there was more financial aid, etc.\n\n2)\na) In class, we have been discussing skill-biased technical change (SBTC) as it\nchanges demand for college graduates versus high school graduates. But in the same\nway, SBTC can change demand for among college graduates with different skills. For\nexample, the rapid development of information technologies might increase the\ndemand for computer science majors relative to literature majors, widening the wage\ngap between them. This kind of phenomenon could account for growing wage\nvariance among college graduates. At the same time, technology has limited job\nopportunities for less skilled workers by eliminating rules-based jobs and so it could\n\nhave produced a stable (or even declining) variance of wages for high school\ngraduates.\n\nb) As long as college graduates are more skilled on average than high school\ngraduates, a college degree still has some signaling value. It does, however, have\nless signaling value than it used to have because of the variance of skills among\ncollege graduates.\n\n3)\n\na) The coefficient means that in industries where the proportion using computers\nwent up by 1% more, the proportion of workers with a college degree went up\n0.152% more. We know that this coefficient is significant because it is more than\ntwo times its standard error.\nb) One possible answer is that the increase in college-educated workers caused the\nincrease in computer usage. For example, suppose that some industries are hiring\nmore college labor for independent reasons, and college workers like to use\ncomputers. The computers are a perk for the college-educated workers that the\nindustry would be hiring in any case.\n\nAlternatively, some third factor could be causing both the increase in computer\nusage and the increase in college labor within an industry. Maybe some industries\nchanged their organizational structure, e.g., to make it less centralized. The\norganizational change could have made it more profitable both to increase\ndemand for college labor and to buy more computers (but the former would have\nhappened even if computers weren't available).\n\nYou didn't need to talk about either of these specific scenarios; you just needed to\nexplain why a significant regression coefficient isn't necessarily indicative of a\ncause and effect relationship.\nc) The big thing to notice here is that the change in computer use is always measured\nfrom 1984-1993; it might have been clearer to put 1984-1993 superscripts on all\nof the\n. Notice that there is a significant relationship between the change in\ncomputer use from 1984-1993 and the change in college employment during the\n1960's and the 1970's. That can't be causal, because the change in computer use\nis happening after the changes in labor demand. Since we observe a positive\nregression coefficient when we know it can't be causal, this should make you\nsuspicious of interpreting the original regression as causal.\ni\nC\nÎ\n\nThat was the main point. But you might also notice that the coefficients on\ncomputer use are going up over time; they're much higher in periods where it\nwould make sense to interpret them as a causal effect. So perhaps a part of the\noriginal coefficient is causal after all. (It wasn't necessary to mention this part.)\n\nSome of you thought that the change in computer use was measured over the\nsame period as the change in college employment in each regression. This got\n\npartial credit depending on what argument you made from there. One reasonable\nargument is that the regression relationship seems to be getting more important as\ncomputers have become a more important part of the economy. You might have\nthought that the causal effect of greater computer use should also be bigger when\ncomputers are important (in the 1960's, other changes swamp the introduction of\ncomputers in determining demand for college labor). So the pattern of regression\ncoefficients seems to mirror the pattern of causal effects that we would expect,\nand we should become more confident in the original regression.\n\n4)\n\na) The basic idea is that you want to do a difference-in-difference design. That\nis, you find some states that increased their level of compulsory schooling\nover a period of time (say 1920-1930) and another set of states that didn't.\nYou can figure out how much schooling people got in each state at each time\nby using the information on age and state of birth (assuming most people go to\nschool where they were born). Then if we define the following,\n\nA = average years of schooling for people in high school in 1930, born in state\nthat tightened its law\n\nB = average years of schooling for people in high school in 1920, born in state\nthat tightened its law\n\nC = average years of schooling for people in high school in 1930, born in state\nthat didn't tighten its law\n\nD = average years of schooling for people in high school in 1920, born in state\nthat didn't tighten its law\n\none possible difference-in-difference estimator is (A-B) - (C-D).\n\nYou could also say that you would regress years of schooling on the minimum\nschooling-leaving age in a person's state of birth when they were in high\nschool. However, it is important in this case to say something about\ncontrolling for a person's state of birth and for a person's age (equivalent to\nthe year they entered high school). If you don't control somehow for state of\nbirth, you're saying that if schooling levels are always higher in (say)\nMassachusetts, and compulsory schooling requirements are high too, then the\nlatter causes the former. That could very easily be false: a pro-education\nculture might lead people to go to school for longer and to require others to\nstay in school for longer too (by making the laws strict). If you don't control\nfor age, you're saying that the increase in schooling levels from one\ngeneration to the next is due to the tighter compulsory schooling laws--but all\nsorts of other things are changing over time too.\n\nb) This question was easier if you remembered the Duflo paper on school\nconstruction in Indonesia, because the idea is almost identical. (Few people\nseemed to make the connection, though.) The important part was to note\nsomehow that the changes in compulsory schooling laws might be a good\nsource of \"random\" variation in years of schooling, and we could then use that\nrandom variation to see whether people's earnings increased.\n\nOne way to do this is to set up the same kind of difference-in-difference\ndesign as in part (a). That is, let\n\nA' = average earnings (or log earnings) for people in high school in 1930,\nborn in state that tightened its law\n\nB' = average earnings (or log earnings) for people in high school in 1920,\nborn in state that tightened its law\n\nC' = average earnings (or log earnings) for people in high school in 1930,\nborn in state that didn't tighten its law\n\nD' = average earnings (or log earnings) for people in high school in 1920,\nborn in state that didn't tighten its law\n\nThe difference-in-difference estimate of the effect of tighter laws on earnings\nis (A'-B') - (C'-D'). That's a good start (worth most of the 10 points), but to\nget the effect of schooling on earnings, you want to divide this by the effect of\ntighter laws on schooling. So your estimate would be\n\n(\n'\n')\n(\n'\n')\n(\n)\n(\nA\nB\nC\nD\nA\nB\nC\nD\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n)\n\nAlternatively, you could say that you would use instrumental variables. You\nwould regress a person's earnings (or log earnings) on their years of\nschooling, and you would instrument years of schooling by the minimum\nschool-leaving age when the person was attending high school. Again, it is\nimportant to say you would control for state of birth and age, for the same\nreasons as in (a).\n\nc) This one was very tricky. The thing to notice is that tighter compulsory\nschooling laws increase years of education for everyone in my cohort, not just\nfor me. The signaling theory is all about how if I have more schooling than\nother people, employers will conclude that I'm more productive and pay me\nmore. But insofar as stricter laws increase everybody's schooling at the same\ntime, employers won't conclude anything new about me, and I won't get paid\nanything more. So if the return to education is all about signaling, then we\nshould estimate something pretty close to 0 in part (b). However, this\nunderestimates an individual's return to education: the individual could\n\nconvince employers that she has higher productivity (at the expense of other\npeople in her cohort) by staying in school for longer."

Illustrate your scenarios with appropriate diagrams.\n\nc) (5 points) Explain what data you would need to distinguish between the two scenarios\nand how you would use these data.\n\nd) (5) Are there conditions that would make college a better investment in 1999 than it\nwas in 1969? Briefly explain why or why not.\n\n2) (25 points) We have proposed skill-biased technical change (SBTC ) as one\nexplanation of the rising ratio [median college graduate earnings/median high school\ngraduate earnings] over recent decades. A closer look at recent earnings data reveals the\nfollowing additional patterns:\n\n-\nThe variance of earnings among college graduates has been\nincreasing.\n\n-\nThe variance of earnings among of high school graduates has been\nrelatively stable.\n\na) (15 points) Sketch a more detailed theory of SBTC that can explain these two trends.\n\nb) (10 points). Given the existence of these two additional trends, explain whether college\ncan continue to serve as a signal to employers.\n\n3) (25 points) In a paper called \"Computing Inequality: Have Computers Changed the\nLabor Market?\", the authors examine the hypothesis that computers have increased\ndemand for skilled workers. In one of their exercises, they estimate the following\nregression:\n\n0.028\n0.152\n(0.059) (0.025)\ni\ni\nE\nC\niÎµ\nÎ\n=\n+\nÎ\n+\n\nwhere\nis the change in the proportion of workers with a college degree in industry i\nfrom 1979 to 1993 and\nis the change in the proportion of workers who use a\ncomputer in industry i between 1984 and 1993. (Standard errors are in parentheses.)\niE\nÎ\ni\nC\nÎ\n\na) (5 points) State precisely what the coefficient on\ni\nC\nÎ\nmeans. How do you know\nwhether it reflects a real pattern in the world and not just random chance in the authors'\nsample?\n\nb) (10 points) A modern-day Luddite seizes upon this regression and announces, \"Ahah!\nComputers have caused demand to shift toward workers with a college degree and away\nfrom less educated workers. If I could somehow get rid of all the computers, this\nregression proves that demand for workers without a college degree would go up.\"\nExplain why the Luddite's inference might be incorrect. (Try to give a concrete reason\nwhy we might estimate the regression above even though the Luddite is mistaken.)\n\nc) (10 points) In the next table, the authors present similar regressions, but with the\nchange in college-level employment calculated over different time periods. The change in\ncomputer use is always calculated between 1984 and 1993. They obtain the following\nresults:\n\n1960 1970\n1970 1980\n1980 1990\n\n0.085\n0.071\n(0.058) (0.025)\n0.279\n0.127\n(0.073) (0.031)\n0.287\n0.147\n(0.\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nE\nC\nE\nC\nE\nC\ni\ni\ni\nÎµ\nÎµ\nÎµ\n-\n-\n-\nÎ\n=\n+\nÎ\n+\nÎ\n=\n+\nÎ\n+\nÎ\n=\n+\nÎ\n+\n1990 1996\n\n108) (0.046)\n0.171\n0.289\n(0.196) (0.081)\ni\ni\nE\nC\niÎµ\n-\nÎ\n= -\n+\nÎ\n+\n\nwhere superscripts on\nindicate the years over which the change is calculated.

Part of this movement was the\ntightening of compulsory schooling laws, which made school attendance mandatory up to\na certain age. The minimum age for leaving school was chosen by each state, and many\nstates increased this minimum over 1910-1940. However, there was wide variation in the\nyear that states chose to tighten their laws.\n\nYou have a large data set from the 1960 census that gives you each person's state of\nbirth, age, years of education, and earnings in 1960. You also have data on the minimum\nage at which a person could legally leave school in each year, for each state.\n\na) (10 points) You first want to estimate the effect of stricter compulsory schooling laws\non a person's years of education. Explain the best way you can think of to estimate this\neffect using the data at your disposal.\n\nb) (10 points) It occurs to you that you might be able to use these data to estimate the\neffect of education on earnings without ability bias contaminating your results. Explain\nthe best way you can think of to estimate the return to schooling using these data. Why is\nyour approach likely to avoid ability bias?\n\nc) (5 points) Suppose that an individual's return to education is mostly due to signaling,\nnot to the accumulation of human capital. Would you expect your estimate in part (b) to\nunderestimate the individual return, overestimate it, or get it right? (By individual return,\nwe mean the change in earnings one person could expect to get if they decided to stay in\nschool for an extra year.) Explain why."

      "content": "Economics of Education Frank Levy\n14.48J/11.126J Spring, 2006\n\nFinal Exam - Answer All Questions\n\n1) (20 points) Each week, the U.S. Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) publishes an\nupdated ranking of the world's best professional golfers. These are the top seven golfers in the\nPGA ranking based on professional golf tournaments through May 14, 2006:\n\n1 - Tiger Woods, 2 - Phil Mickelson, 3 - Retief Goosen, 4 - Vijay Singh 5 - Jim Furyk\n6 - Ernie Els, 7 - Sergio Garcia,\n\na) (10 points) Briefly discuss the likely methods the PGA uses to construct their weekly ranking.\nExplain why you think the PGA ranking of top golfers is more or less accurate than the U.S.\nNews and World Report ranking of the top U.S. colleges and universities.\n\nAnswer: While each tournament has multiple players, we can think of a tournament as a set of\nhead-to-head competitions and so the PGA ranking likely focuses on who beats who. In addition,\nthe order of finish in different tournaments may get different weights depending on the number\nof competitors, the tournament's prestige (which may determine how hard people try, etc).\n\nThis ranking is likely to be more accurate than the U.S. News Ranking of universities since it is\nunambiguous that a professional golfer's only goal is winning tournaments. The University, by\ncontrast, has multiple goals, some of which, like the quality of teaching, are not easy to measure\nand so the U.S. News Rankings are more based on surrogate measures that do not get exactly\nwhat you want.\n\nA different way of thinking about it is that we have seen that universities can manipulate the U.S.\nNews rankings by encouraging more applicants, by doing strategic admissions, etc. (none of\nwhich are likely to change the university's quality) while if my description of the PGA rankings\nis correct, it is not clear how those rankings can be manipulated.\n\nb) (10 points) Both the PGA ranking and the U.S. News ranking are examples of\ncommensuration - a process of applying the same numerical yardstick to different units\n(different golfers, different universities) in order to rank them. Based on the topics we have\ndiscussed this semester, identify a second important education example of commensuration and\nexplain its advantages and limitations.\n\nAnswer: The major example is the use of statewide testing programs that are part of the\nstandards movement. The advantage of these tests is that it helps to clarify a school's objective\nfunction and creates information that is of some use to parents. The disadvantage is that the tests\nmay measure only part of what you would like to accomplish in education but preparing for the\ntests is likely to absorb much of a school's efforts (\"What you test is what you get.) A secondary\ndisadvantage is that the test scores have a lot of year-to-year fluctuation which can be a problem\nif too much is riding on them.\n\n2) (20 points) Congress is currently debating U.S. immigration policy including whether the\nnation should maintain a large guest worker program that would allow significant numbers of\nLatin American citizens to work here on a temporary basis.\n\na) (10 points) We know from basic economic theory that when labor becomes scarce and\nexpensive, employers have an incentive to substitute capital for labor. If Congress fails to renew\na guest worker program, to what extent will employers be able to directly substitute computers\nfor the work previously done by Latin American guest workers? Most of the work? Some of the\nwork? Not much of the work? Carefully explain your logic and illustrate your answer with some\nspecific examples.\n\nAnswer: I would think that not much substitution is possible. A significant fraction of immigrant\nlabor works in lower wage physical and service jobs - restaurants, meat packing plants, domestic\nwork, janitorial work, construction etc. This work is characterized by non-routine physical\nactivity and, in some cases, face-to-face transactions. Both kinds of tasks are hard to express in\nrules and so hard to computerize.\n\nb) (10 points) During the semester, we argued that computers play a role in determining the\nearnings gap between college graduates and high school graduates. Does this argument have any\nrelevance for the demand for guest workers? Explain why or why not.\n\nAnswer: Ultimately, you would think that there is relevance. When computers substitute for\nworkers in assembly line, clerical and other similar rules based jobs, the displaced workers have\nto find work elsewhere in the economy - i.e. they either have to move up the wage scale (which\nrequires additional skill) or move down. If the supply of workers moving down gets large\nenough, some will begin to complete in the same occupations now dominated by immigrants.\n\n(There may be a different answer here about high school drop outs and high school graduates not\nreally competing - you should use your judgment on that and give good points for sensible\nanswers ot this kind).\n\n3) a) (15 points) Construct an argument supporting very early childhood education (ages 6\nmonths to 5 years) as a central piece of U.S. educational policy. Back up the points you make by\nreferences to specific readings and ideas discussed in class.\n\nAnswer: The argument by citing the work of Heckman that argues three main points:\n\n- IQ measures have a fair amount of predictive power in both labor market measures\n(educational attainment, adult earnings even holding education constant), and also\nother measures like drug use, out-of-wedlock pregnancy, etc.\n\n- IQ measures are set relatively early (e.g. by age 4 or 5).\n\n- But evidence from very early childhood programs like Perry Pre School and\nAbcderian (not spelled right) show that IQ measures can be raised by such\ninterventions.\n\n- Additional points came from class discussion of the black/white test score gap\n\no The discussion of the Fryer Levit paper showing that tests of cognitive\nfunction at 8 months showed virtually no black/white differences while IQ\nscores at 4-5 years showed the standard 1sd gap.\n\no Limited evidence on interracial adoptions showing that black children\nraised in adoptive white homes scores significantly higher on IQ tests than\nblack children raised in adoptive black homes).\n\no Both of these piece of evidence point to a need for some kind of\nenvironmental intervention in a child's very early years.\n\nb) (5 points) Briefly summarize evidence for the counter argument that we don't yet know\nenough to spend large sums of money on very early childhood education.\n\nAnswer:\n\n- Heckman's evidence for IQ gains is really based on only a couple of studies. In addition,\nMike Anderson's work shows the evidence is really only there for girls.\n\n- The possibility, raised in class, that we are not really sure what the 8 month cognitive\ntests are measuring and it could be that if you could ask the 4 year old IQ questions to the\n8 month old infants, you would see the same 1sd black white difference.\n\n4) (20 points) Assume that in the year 2001, the Colorado state legislature recognized that\nstudent access to public school computers varied dramatically across the state's counties. Urban\nand suburban counties averaged three students per computer and most of the computers had\ninternet access. Poorer rural counties averaged 21 students per computer and many of the rural\nschool computers lacked internet access.\n\nMembers of the legislature believed that lack of computer and internet access was depressing\nachievement test scores of rural students. Correspondingly, the legislature funded a program that\nwas supposed to purchase computers, software and internet access for \"computer poor\" counties.\n\nIt is now 2006 and the legislature wants to set up an evaluation of the computers' impact. They\nhave turned to you to do the job.\n\na) (10 points) When administrators establish a program like this, problems often arise that limit\nthe possibility of doing a good evaluation. For example, suppose that you have heard anecdotes\nthat some rural teachers who received the state-funded computers and software used their own\nfunds to purchase in-service training on how to use computers in the classroom. If that actually\nhappened, would it prevent you from evaluating the computers' impact on test scores? Explain\nwhy or why not. Describe two other problems (other than data problems) that might prevent you\nfrom doing a good evaluation of the computers' impact.\n\nAnswer: If some teachers purchase training, it does not invalidate the evaluation. The\n\"treatment\" we want to evaluate in this case is putting computers into the schools with the\nunderstanding that the state has no ability to control how the computers are used (including\nwhether teachers buy training). In this sense, the evaluation is similar to the Rouse analysis of\nMilwaukee (the policy was whether the kid won a chance to go to private school, whether or not\nthe used the chance) or the Dynarski evaluation of the Georgia and Arkansas scholarship\nprograms (the policy is making the scholarship available, whether or not students actually used\nthem) or the DuFlo evaluation of the Indonesian Schools (the policy was building schools in\nparticular areas whether or not kids actually attended them.)\n\nIf training is effective and only some teachers buy it, results may be statistically insignificant\nsince classrooms where the teachers got training may show positive results and classrooms\nwhere teachers didn't get training may show no results (i.e. a high variance). But that would be\nan accurate representation of reality - that simply putting computers in the classroom does not\nguarantee results.\n\nSome other factors that might undermine an evaluation: Unknown to you, the \"computer rich\nschools\" started additional programs of their own. The computers in the computer-poor schools\ncaused new students (either high achievers or low achievers) to move into the area, etc. One\nfactor that would not invalidate the experiment was teachers putting computers in the closet.\nAgain, we are not evaluating \"how much can computers raise test scores under ideal conditions\"\nbut rather \"how much can the state raise test scores by buying computers for schools and\ndropping them off at the schoolhouse door.\".\n\nb) (10 points) Assume that none of these problems actually arise. Explain how you would\nstructure an evaluation of computers' impact on test scores - the data you would need, the way\nyou would use the data, and so on.\n\nAnswer: The question is: Who is your control group? One possibility are kids in the\nurban/suburban Colorado schools. Presumably, they start at a higher level of achievement than\nthe rural kids (which is why the legislature passed the program). So the evaluation here would\nhave to be difs-in-difs: comparing the changes over time in test scores for four groups of kids:\n\na) Rural kids who went through school before the computers\nwere put in rural schools\n\nb) Rural kids who went through school after computers were put\nin rural schools.\n\nc) Urban/Suburban kids who went through schools before\ncomputers were put in RURAL schools.\n\nd) Urban/Suburban kids who went through schools after\ncomputers were put in RURAL schools.\n\nAs with the examples we would expect the gap between (b) and (a) to be larger (more\nimprovement) than the gap between (d) and (c)\n\nAlternatively, you could think about trying to find a control group using rural counties in other\nstates that were similar in the test they took, their test scores, etc., but they had no computer\nprogram. If we could find such a control group, then we could again do difs-in-difs or put this\ninto a single regression, etc.\n\n5) (20 points) For many years, educational production functions have had a central role in\neconomists' study of education. As in production function analysis for private sector firms, the\nidea is to collect data from schools to estimate the relationship between a school's inputs and a\nparticular school output - normally some kind of student test score.\n\nIn both firms and schools, the estimated relationship between inputs and an output depends on\nseveral factors. There is an underlying technology that specifies the maximum amount of a\nparticular output that can be achieved with a particular combination of inputs. There is also the\nbehavior of managers, workers, etc. that determines whether the maximum of a particular output\nis actually achieved. For example, technology may say that an office worker has the potential to\nwrite 45 pieces of correspondence in a day, but this output will be far lower if the worker is told\nto answer incoming telephone calls as well as write correspondence.\n\na) (6 points). When economists use private sector data to estimate a production function - for\nexample, the production function for automobile plants - what assumptions are they making\nabout the manager and worker behavior that generated the data? What are the implications of this\nbehavior for the estimated inputs-output relationship?\n\nAnswer: They assume that the output of the production function is the firm's focus and that\nprofit maximization is insuring that everyone in the firm is working to get the maximum amount\nof that output from the available inputs. In other words, what you observe is the maximum that\nthe technology allows.\n\nb) (7 points) Explain how the principal and teacher behavior that generate data for a standard\neducational production function may differ from the behavior in a private sector firm. What are\nthe implications of these differences for the estimated educational production function?\n\nAnswer: The most important factor is that it is not clear schools are trying to maximize\nachievement test scores. They may be emphasizing skills that the tests do not capture; they may\nbe trying to keep kids from dropping out; they may want to avoid making waves, etc.. Any of\nthese things will cause schools to not reach the potential relationship between inputs and outputs.\n\nc) (7 points) Use your answers in (a) and (b) to explain why it makes sense to run careful\nexperiments on the impact of class size (e.g. Krueger's STAR experiment in Tennessee) or to\ncarefully describe a successful model for in-service training of tenured teachers (e.g. Elmore's\nstudy of New York City District 2). In other words, why haven't schools already discovered this\nknowledge in the course of their normal behavior?\n\nAnswer: You need experiments like these to understand the shape of the \"potential\" educational\nproduction function. For example, in the case of the STAR experiment, teachers knew they were\npart of an experiment and that lots of attention would be paid to the children's test scores. Given\nthat teachers are focused on the test scores, the experiment can give us some evidence on\nwhether teachers in small classes can do a better job raising test scores than teachers in larger\nclasses. This is particularly true since the experiment ran over multiple years giving teachers a\nchance to adjust.\n\nIn a normal (non-experimental) situation - e.g. the various studies summarized by Hanushek -\nthis relationship may be hard to discover statistically because small classes may be correlated\nwith other (omitted) variables like low achieving students; teachers may not be fully focused on\ntest scores and so there is no reason for them to discover the relationship, etc.\n\n*********************"

These are the top seven golfers in the\nPGA ranking based on professional golf tournaments through May 14, 2006:\n\n1 - Tiger Woods, 2 - Phil Mickelson, 3 - Retief Goosen, 4 - Vijay Singh 5 - Jim Furyk\n6 - Ernie Els, 7 - Sergio Garcia,\n\na) (10 points) Briefly discuss the likely methods the PGA uses to construct their weekly ranking.\nExplain why you think the PGA ranking of top golfers is more or less accurate than the U.S.\nNews and World Report ranking of the top U.S. colleges and universities.\n\nb) (10 points) Both the PGA ranking and the U.S. News ranking are examples of\ncommensuration - a process of applying the same numerical yardstick to different units\n(different golfers, different universities) in order to rank them. Based on the topics we have\ndiscussed this semester, identify a second important education example of commensuration and\nexplain its advantages and limitations.\n\n2) (20 points) Congress is currently debating U.S. immigration policy including whether the\nnation should maintain a large guest worker program that would allow significant numbers of\nLatin American citizens to work here on a temporary basis.\n\na) (10 points) We know from basic economic theory that when labor becomes scarce and\nexpensive, employers have an incentive to substitute capital for labor. If Congress fails to renew\na guest worker program, to what extent will employers be able to directly substitute computers\nfor the work previously done by Latin American guest workers? Most of the work? Some of the\nwork? Not much of the work? Carefully explain your logic and illustrate your answer with some\nspecific examples.\n\nb) (10 points) During the semester, we argued that computers play a role in determining the\nearnings gap between college graduates and high school graduates. Does this argument have any\nrelevance for the demand for guest workers? Explain why or why not.\n\n3) a) (15 points) Construct an argument supporting very early childhood education (ages 6\nmonths to 5 years) as a central piece of U.S. educational policy. Back up the points you make by\nreferences to specific readings and ideas discussed in class.\n\nb) (5 points) Briefly summarize evidence for the counter argument that we don't yet know\nenough to spend large sums of money on very early childhood education.\n\n4) (20 points) Assume that in the year 2001, the Colorado state legislature recognized that\nstudent access to public school computers varied dramatically across the state's counties. Urban\nand suburban counties averaged three students per computer and most of the computers had\ninternet access. Poorer rural counties averaged 21 students per computer and many of the rural\nschool computers lacked internet access.\n\nMembers of the legislature believed that lack of computer and internet access was depressing\nachievement test scores of rural students. Correspondingly, the legislature funded a program that\nwas supposed to purchase computers, software and internet access for \"computer poor\" counties.\n\nIt is now 2006 and the legislature wants to set up an evaluation of the computers' impact. They\nhave turned to you to do the job.\n\na) (10 points) When administrators establish a program like this, problems often arise that limit\nthe possibility of doing a good evaluation. For example, suppose that you have heard anecdotes\nthat some rural teachers who received the state-funded computers and software used their own\nfunds to purchase in-service training on how to use computers in the classroom. If that actually\nhappened, would it prevent you from evaluating the computers' impact on test scores? Explain\nwhy or why not. Describe two other problems (other than data problems) that might prevent you\nfrom doing a good evaluation of the computers' impact.\n\nb) (10 points) Assume that none of these problems actually arise. Explain how you would\nstructure an evaluation of computers' impact on test scores - the data you would need, the way\nyou would use the data, and so on.\n\n5) (20 points) For many years, educational production functions have had a central role in\neconomists' study of education. As in production function analysis for private sector firms, the\nidea is to collect data from schools to estimate the relationship between a school's inputs and a\nparticular school output - normally some kind of student test score.\n\nIn both firms and schools, the estimated relationship between inputs and an output depends on\nseveral factors. There is an underlying technology that specifies the maximum amount of a\nparticular output that can be achieved with a particular combination of inputs. There is also the\nbehavior of managers, workers, etc. that determines whether the maximum of a particular output\nis actually achieved. For example, technology may say that an office worker has the potential to\nwrite 45 pieces of correspondence in a day, but this output will be far lower if the worker is told\nto answer incoming telephone calls as well as write correspondence.\n\na) (6 points). When economists use private sector data to estimate a production function - for\nexample, the production function for automobile plants - what assumptions are they making\nabout the manager and worker behavior that generated the data? What are the implications of this\nbehavior for the estimated inputs-output relationship?\n\nb) (7 points) Explain how the principal and teacher behavior that generate data for a standard\neducational production function may differ from the behavior in a private sector firm. What are\nthe implications of these differences for the estimated educational production function?\n\nc) (7 points) Use your answers in (a) and (b) to explain why it makes sense to run careful\nexperiments on the impact of class size (e.g. Krueger's STAR experiment in Tennessee) or to\ncarefully describe a successful model for in-service training of tenured teachers (e.g. Elmore's\nstudy of New York City District 2).

      "content": "Economics of Education Frank Levy\n14.48J/11.126J Spring, 2006\n\nMid-Term Answers\n\n1) The introduction of power looms was similar to the computerization of jobs in that\nboth are examples of technology eliminating a significant number of jobs. The two\ntechnologies are different in that power looms displaced skilled workers - weavers who\nhad taken some time to learn their craft - and increased demand for low skilled workers -\nthe farm laborers. Computerized work has the opposite effect displacing lower skilled\nworkers - e.g. assembly line workers - and increasing demand for higher skilled workers.\nIf computers are \"skill-biased\" technical change, the power looms were \"low-skill bias\"\ntechnical change.\n\n2) a) The projections may be misleading because they ignore the kinds of changes in skill\nrequirements that can happen within an occupation. For example, before computerized\nmodules, auto mechanics didn't have to know much about electronics or how to use\ncomputerized testing equipment including the ability to read testing equipment manuals.\nThey need to know all of that today and so a new auto mechanic typically has to attend\none or two years of post-high school training.\n\nb) An economist usually measures shortages by tracking prices and quantities. Suppose\nyou collect data in the coming years that shows that the number of college educated\nworkers grows faster than the number of high school educated workers. If there really is\nno strong demand for college educated workers, the wages of college educated workers\nshould fall (because they are in excess supply) and the college-high wage gap should\nclose.\n\nWhat occurred from 1980 through the present was the opposite: the number of college\ngraduates grew faster than the number of high school graduates and yet the college-high\nschool wage gap grew. It was this combination that demonstrated that labor market\ndemand was shifting toward more educated workers.\n\n3a) In the standard human capital model, you should acquire all your education at the\nbeginning of your career so you can benefit from the higher earnings for as long as\npossible through your career. If we think about a career as having a fixed retirement date,\npostponing education for a year means you are substituting a low earnings year for a high\nearnings year.\n\n3b) It probably would have been higher in the 1980s than the 1990s because of the very\nsharp increase in the return to education between the late 1970s and the mid 1980s.\nBecause of this sharp change, it is likely that there were many people in the late 1970s\nwho decided not to go beyond high school since the returns to education were very low\n(The Overeducated American reading) but then went back to school when the returns\nincreased so much beginning with the 1980-83 blue collar recession. The return to\neducation didn't change so much from the 1980s to the 1990s, so there aren't likely to be\n\nas many people going back to school in the 1990s to benefit from a higher return to\neducation.....the people who were ever to acquire a lot of education would have already\ndone it earlier.\n\n3c) The assumption is that the incomes a person can receive from the various levels of\neducation are known in advance. Although this assumption need not hold literally in\norder for the model to be useful, the wide fluctuations in the return to education over\nbetween the late 1970s and mid 1980s might make us want to consider a richer model\nthat allows for some uncertainty in the return to education.\n\n4a) The t-statistic is -2.89/.93, which is about -3.1. Thus, it looks from this regression\nthat the teacher having a masters degree has a statistically significant negative impact on\na student's test score. If you are to believe this, then it would be the case that you\nprobably don't want to have a teacher with a masters degree.\n\n4b) There are probably some important variables missing from the regression. Perhaps\nthe teachers with the advanced degrees are placed with students who are lower-\nperforming anyway, and this may not be adequately controlled for in the regression. This\nwould explain why we would observe a negative relationship in the data between a\nmasters degree and low test scores by students without the masters degree being the cause\nof the low test scores.\n\n4c) The best thing to do would be a randomized controlled experiment. Take a set of\nstudents and a set of teachers, some of whom have a masters degree and some of whom\ndo not. Randomly allocate the students to the teachers (in a way that keeps class size as\nequal as possible), and compare the average score of the students with an MA teacher to\nthe average score of the students without an MA teacher on some achievement test given\nlater on."

The techniques they used\ntook some time to learn and typically were passed from one generation to the next.\nOne aspect of the Industrial Revolution was the shifting textile production from home\nlooms to machines in factories. From the 1790s to the 1830s, more than 100,000 power\nlooms with 9,330,000 spindles were put into service in England and Scotland. These\nlooms were tended people who had previously worked as farm laborers.\nCompare and contrast the labor market impacts of these power looms to the labor market\nimpact of computers as discussed in the readings and in class.\n2) (25 points) Over time, several different researchers have done versions of the\nfollowing analysis:\n- The analysis begins by classifying jobs in today's economy - e.g. auto\nmechanic, lawyer, secretary, etc. - by the amount of education the job\nrequires.\n- The analysis then presents projections by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\nthat show that the proportions of the work force who will be lawyers, auto\nmechanics, secretaries, etc. 20 years into the future will not be radically\ndifferent from those proportions in today's work force.\n- The analysis then concludes that projected shift in demand for more college\ngraduates is wrong and that policies to encourage college attendance risk\ncreating \"The Overeducated American\" all over again.\na) (15 points) Assuming the Bureau of Labor Statistics projections are correct, explain\nwhy you think this analysis is or is not a reasonable basis for making educational policy.\nIf possible, choose a specific occupation and use it to illustrate your answer.\n\nb) (10 points) Considering how economists usually determine the existence of demand\nshifts, explain what kinds of basic economic data you could collect to see if the\nresearchers' analysis is turning out to be correct.\n3) (30 points) In most of our class discussions, we implicitly or explicitly model an\nindividual's career as having two separate periods:\n- A first period - schooling - in which the individual acquires education full\ntime. During this period, we assume they do little or no work for pay. For\nmost people, this period ends sometime between the ages of 17 and their\nmid-20's.\n- A second period - a work history - in which the individual works fulltime in\na sequence of jobs. This period begins when the individual's education ends\nand it lasts until they retire - say, at age 65. During this period, we assume\nthey acquire no fulltime education.\na) (10 points) In the standard human capital model of educational attainment, why does\nthis two-period model make sense? That is, why should a person want to finish all their\neducation before they start to work?\nb) (15 points) In real life, of course, some people who have worked full time can go back\nto get additional education - for example, starting junior college or college in their late\n20's or early 30's. Should we expect that the fraction of young people choosing this\noption should have been higher in the 1980s or the 1990s? Explain.\nc) (5 points) Explain how did labor market conditions from the late 1970s through the\n1980s violated a basic assumption of the standard human capital model.\n4) (30 points) It is 1995 and you are education advisor to the governor of Massachusetts.\nYou have just been given a regression that was done by your predecessor in the job who\nwas assessing the effectiveness of high school teachers having a Masters Degree. The\nregression is based data collected from a random sample of schools in the state.\nUnfortunately, your predecessor left before the research was finished. The governor has\ncalled you into her office to explain what the regression says.\n\nWhat appears below is part of the estimated regression:\n\nTest ScoreJUNE I,J = 3.63 - 2.89*MAI + (other variables )\n(1..01) (-.93)\n\n(figures in parentheses are the standard errors of the coefficients)\n\nWhere: Test ScoreJUNE I,J is the June Standardized Test Score of Student I in High School\nSubject J (i.e. math, history, English, etc.)\n\nMAI = 1 if the teacher of Student I in High School Subject J has a Masters\nDegree in at least one subject.\n\n= 0 if the teacher or Student I in High School Subject J has no\nMasters Degree (or PhD) in any subject.\n\na) (10 points).According to the regression, does having a Masters Degree have a\nstatistically significant effect on a student's achievement test score? Explain how you\nknow. If you believe the regression is correct, what policy implications do you draw?\n\nb) (10 points) Describe, as completely as you can, why the estimated regression might not\nbe correct and so should not be used for policy.\n\nc) (10 points) Assume the governor throws the current study out and asks you to\ndetermine whether having a Masters Degree increases student performance. Briefly\nexplain how you would approach the problem. You are free to generate new data if you\nthink it is relevant.\n\n***********************"

In\nthe 1990s, 9%.\n\nWhat if we adopted a one year policy intervention for people between the ages of 17\nand 25? What about interventions at other ages such as very young children? Are\nthe results very different?\n\nEarly Childhood Intervention:\n\nTheory:\n1. Children have more plastic brains. Their brains more easily form and reform\nneural networks than older people can. In other words, their neurons are\nmore flexible and they have very few old neural networks to disrupt when\nlearning\nExperiments on animals corroborate the theory:\n\n-Observations of monkeys developing at various ages with and without\nmaternal contact show very different behavioral outcomes.\n-The damaged eye experiment\n-Language development: Infants are capable of learning any language or\neven more than one while older people have a harder time mastering a\nlanguage when they start learning it before infancy. However, evidence of the\ndifficulty of learning certain language pairs together is not discussed.\n\n2. Learning is cumulative. Cognitive and social skills at age X affect a person's\nability to learn at age X+1.\nSocial skills affect learning because learning is often not done alone. It\nrequires collaboration, interaction, dealing with frustration, and disruptions.\n\nTesting the theory:\nThe data available is:\n1) Test scores at 22 months\n2) Test scores at 42 months\n3) Test scores at 5 years\n4) Test scores at 10 years\n5) Record of educational attainment at age 26\n6) Socioeconomic status of the parents (SES)\n\nTest scores at 42 months should do a good job of predicting 5 year test scores, 10\nyear test scores, and educational attainment at age 26.\n\nTest scores at 22 months should do a poorer job than test scores at 42 months of\npredicting because a child's brain is more plastic at 22 months and has more\npotential to change. However, a relationship still exists between test scores at 22\nmonths and test scores at older ages.\n\nSuppose low test scores at 42 months do a good job of predicting low educational\nattainment.\nHow do we explain this?\n\nKnudsen, et al. argue:\nCognitive ability at 42 months is a function of experience and genetic differences.\nExperience encompasses all parent-child interactions language interaction, whether a\nparent reads to the child, whether the parent allows the child to ask questions.\nExperience is found to vary by socioeconomic status.\n\nTherefore, low cognitive ability at 42 months can be explained by low quality of\nparental interaction with a child. It is safe to assume that it will continue to be of low\nquality in the future. Because socioeconomic status plays a role in child-parent\ninteraction, socioeconomic status plays a role in cognitive ability development.\n\nIn the data, we need independent variation so we can separate the effects of the\nparent's socioeconomic status and test scores on educational attainment at age 26.\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ntestscore\nSES\nt\nlAttainmen\nEducationa\nÎµ\nÎ²\nÎ²\nÎ±\n+\n+\n+\n=\n,\n,\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n\n11.126J, The Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\n\nLecture 4\nPage 2 of 3\n\nIf our data only includes people with high test scores and high socioeconomic status\nor people with low test scores and low socioeconomic status then we have a case of\nmulti-colinearity, where the independent variables are highly correlated.\n\nHow do we test the data?\n\nAt 22 months, the cognitive ability tests include cube stacking, language use,\npersonal development I and II, drawing, gross motor development.\n\nAt 10 years, the tests include reading, math, picture/language, and the British Ability\nScale.\n\nThese tests are only useful if we can compare earlier tests to subsequent tests so the\ntests at different ages must be boiled down into principal components to transform\nthe variables.\n\nPrincipal components:\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nLU\nb\nCS\nb\nF\nLU\na\nCS\na\nF\n,2\n,1\n+\n=\n+\n=\n\nWhere both equations are weighted averages of the various tests.

This isn't an either or proposition where you can only work with the parents\nor only work with the children. In many cases, it may be best when interventions\nfocus on both the parents and the children.\n\nBasic question of this unit:\nDo (very) early childhood interventions have a very big payoff?\n\nIf its an issue of scientific inquiry, we need to structure out approach in the following\nway:\n1) Theory of plausibility\n2) Hypothesis\n3) Data\n\nEducation qualifications at age 26 is a market in our data. In other words, we are\nlooking ultimately at what determines this outcome by first looking for correlations\nbetween earlier test scores and this data.\nNone\nLow/Middle\nA-level\nTest at 22 mos\n---bottom 25%\n15%\n53%\n32%\n---top 25%\n8%\n49%\n43%\nTest at 5 years\n---bottom 25%\n30%\n52%\n18%\n---top 25%\n5%\n38%\n60%\n\nIf we take the test scores at 22 mos, there seems to be a lot of randomness to the\nsubsequent educational outcomes. On the other hand, if we take test scores at age\n5, there is a large difference between the overall subsequent educational attainment\nof the top 25% and the bottom 25%. A 5 year test score can say something about\nfuture educational outcomes.\n\nNote: All of these tests do have a margin of error which can depend on anything\nfrom what the test subject ate from breakfast that morning to who administered the\ntest.\n\nWhat are the two main factors behind the test scores:\n1) Genetics\n\n2) Environment, specifically parental interaction\n\nTest Percentile, 22 mos\nTest Percentile, 118 mos\nAt 22 mos\nHigh SES, high test scores\n85%\n72%\nLow SES, high test scores\n85%\n40%\nHigh SES, low test scores\n12%\n60%\nLow SES, low test scores\n12%\n28%\n\nFrom the above data, we can see that environment is playing a role in children's\neducational outcomes as parent SES is affecting test scores. Therefore, an\nintervention may work.\n\nWhat would a good intervention program look like?\nMost conclusions are based on 2 programs.\n1) Perry Preschool Program in Michigan\n\n2) ABCDERIAN in North Carolina:\n\n-Program starts at 4.4 months\n\n-Consists of 8 hours of preschool per day, 5 days/week, 50 weeks/year\n\n-Receive iron fortified formula, free diapers, social services home visits\n\n-Continues until kindergarten\n\nHow would be evaluate the ABCDERIAN program?\nWe need a control group as a baseline comparison, randomly chosen from applicants\nto control for any self-selection bias in the group of applicants.\n\nProblems that we could have with the data:\n-Attrition\n-Control group families could creep into the treatment group as they pressure the\nstudy administrators for access\n\nIn the study, there were 57 treatment families and 54 control families, which is a\nsmall sample size.\n\nResults:\n\nControl IQ\nTreatment IQ\nControl IQ\nTreatment IQ\nAge 5\n96.7\n+4.9\n90.8\n+10.19\nAge 6.5\n93.0\n+5.1\n92.1\n+7.18\nAge 12\n87.4\n+8.5\n90.5\n+3.21\nFemale\nMale\n\n11.126J, The Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\n\nLecture 5\nPage 2 of 3\n\nHow do we interpret these results?\n-First, we must remember that both the treatment and control groups are comprised\nof very poor families\n-All the differential numbers are positive\n-Females benefited more from the program than males did since their advantage\nover the control group increased whereas it decreased for the males\n\nUltimately, we need to calculate the rates of return for various early childhood\ninterventions to evaluate them outright and to compare them with elementary and\nhigh school aged interventions.\n\nThe calculated internal rate of return for the Perry Preschool program is 8%.\nComparatively, the Job Corps rate of return in 9%.\n\nImportant questions:\n\n-Given the evidence, do these early childhood interventions blow away other\neducational investments and interventions?\n\n-What is the quality of the available evidence on early childhood interventions?\n\nFreeman Reading: published in 1976\n-Focused on analysis of the 1970s job market and projects for the 1980s\n-At that time, the economic benefits of attending college were being eroded\n\nRatio of interest:\n(Median earnings of 25-34 year old BAs)/(Median earnings of 25-34 year old HS\ngrads)\n\nRight after Freeman published his book, the ratio exploded.\n\nWhat happened between 1980 and 1985?\n\nIn the 1970s, there was a decrease in demand for college graduates, which resulted\nin a decrease in the number of college graduates hired and a decrease in their\nsalaries.\n\nIn cases where the demand curve shifts inward, there must be a decrease in\nequilibrium quantity and there may be a decrease in price. The elasticity of the\nsupply curve will determine the magnitude of these changes. In the case of the\nmarket for college graduates, the supply is more elastic in the long run than in the\nshort run. In fact, the short run supply is quite fixed since students must decide 4\nyears before they enter the job market whether or not they will attend college. With\nan elastic supply curve, changes in demand result in equilibrium quantity changes.\n11.126J, The Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\n\nLecture 5\nPage 3 of 3"

      "content": "14.48, Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\nLecture 6: Do our regression estimates overestimate the impact of\neducation on earnings? The Case of Ability Bias\n\nFrom last lecture:\n\nFreeman discusses wages in two ways: the college-HS wage gap and the real wage.\nHe was responding to the drop in both the college-HS wage gap and the real wage in\nthe 1970s.\n\nWhy do people have more purchasing power now than in 1850? There have been\nincreases in TFP and productivity (output/hour) over time: from 1947-1973,\nproductivity growth average 3% per year while it averaged only 1.2% per year from\n1973-1975.\n\nQuestion from last lecture:\nHow to we reconcile the human capital model with Freeman short-term view of the\nlabor market for college graduates?\nAnswer:\nIn the human capital model, people evaluate their projected earning from ages 18-\n65 when considering college. Freeman says, on the other hand, the people may\nmake college decision based upon their projected age 18-65 earnings but what they\nknow at the time of making that decision is the current market conditions. Projecting\nthe current college-HS wage gap us not a bad assumption to make until the market\ntells you otherwise.\nIf the wage to a college graduate is fluctuating and the supply of college\ngraduates is inelastic in the short-run, then college graduates have little flexibility in\nthe work and wages available to them. Once a student chooses to enter college, it a\n4-year endeavor and the job market can change greatly from when a student enters\nto when he graduates. In the long run, student can adjust to changes in the job\nmarket that last longer than a short-term change in wages.\n\nThe cobweb model: Originally developed for agricultural economics, specifically the\nstudy of cattle raising, an industry in which you have to make production choices 2-3\nyears before you can sell the cattle on the market.\n\nWe know that the market for college graduates is cyclical because there isn't\nmechanism for simultaneous real-time adjustment.\n-When evaluating the market, we need both SR and LR supply curves. Demand for\ncertain types of workers can change faster than people can change their skills.\n\nFor example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, in the wake of the collapse of the\nSoviet Union, there was a huge decline in US defense spending and the demand for\ndefense industry workers. The result was a significant decrease in the employment of\ndefense industry workers.\n\nLet's look at this graphically. Initially, the labor market is in equilibrium at point 1.\nWhen the demand curve shifts outwards, supply cannot respond in the SR so wages\nincrease. The new equilibrium is labeled point 2. Laborers adjust their wage\nexpectations upwards to the wage at point 2, increasing the quantity of laborers\navailable, labeled point 3, which depressed wages. This cycle continues until the\nlabor market reach equilibrium at point 4.\nQ, college grads\nWage, $/Hr\nS\nSR\nQ\nD\nQ\nS\nLR\nQ\n\nWhat about the market for anesthesiologists? Demand for them should be more\nstable considering the steadily increasing demand for health care in the US.\nHowever, the supply lag is very long considering anesthesiologists must attend\ncollege then medical school and then complete the rest of their medical training.\n\nQuestion from last lecture:\nWhat happened to reverse the convergence of college and High-school wages from\n1980-1985?\nAnswer:\n(Ratio of median 25-34 year old male BA's)/(Ratio of median 25-34 year old male\nHS):\n1961- 1.37\n1965- 1.37\n1969- 1.47\n\n1973- 1.30\n1980- 1.30\n1985- 1.48\n14.48, The Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\n\nLecture 6\nPage 2 of 5\n\nMacroeconomic events in the 1970s:\n1) 1971-1973: Significant inflation in food prices. In the US alone, food prices\nincreased 33% in only 2 years. While there was downward pressure on the\nrestaurant industry, the farming industry exploded along with an increase in\ndemand for blue-collar agricultural workers.\n2) 1974: The oil crises. Prices quadrupled in 3 months. There was an economic\nboom in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and any other oil producing regions in\nthe US. There was a subsequent increase in the demand for blue-collar oil\nindustry workers.\n3) 1971: Nixon abandoned fixed exchange rates and floated the dollar. The\ndollar fell in value, which helped export industries, especially manufacturing.\nThere was a corresponding increase in demand for blue-collar manufacturing\nworkers.\n4) 1970s: There was a general bubble in demand for blue-collar labor in the US,\nwhich was much higher than any long-run trends.\n\nSo what happened? 1-3 were temporary shocks and there was an eventual decrease\nin demand for blue-collar workers in the late 1970s, early 1980s. Additionally,\ninflation was generally very high in the US in the 1970s. In fact, from 1970-1980,\nconsumer prices doubled. In response, Jimmy Carter appointed Paul Volcker as\nChairmen of the Fed with instructions to break the cycle of high inflation. To do so,\nVolcker greatly decreased the US money supply, which increased US interest rates. A\nfew years later, President Reagan passed a series of tax cuts without decreasing\nFederal spending. Markets began to worry about returning high inflation and a\nrecession. From 1980-1985, inflation was still low but interest rates were still very\nhigh. The 10-year US Treasury bonds, which usually pay 2% per year adjusted for\ninflation, were paying 6-7% per year adjusted for inflation from 1982-1983. Not\nsurprisingly, there was an increase in demand for US bonds and US$ to buy those\nbonds. In response, the manufacturing industry collapses as does the oil industry in\nthe US and farming perform nearly as well as it did in the 1970s. This quick collapse\nin industries that higher a lot of blue-collar workers allowed the college-HS wage\nratio to quickly increase.\n\nIt is important to remember that Freeman was writing at a time of unique\ncircumstances in the US economy.\n\nWhat are we measuring when we measure the return to education?\n\nThe Mincer equation:\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nEducation\nAge\nAge\nw\nÎµ\nÎ²\nÎ²\nÎ²\nÎ±\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nln(\n\nThe rate of return to education:\n\n)\n(\nÎ²\n=\nâ\nâ\nââ\nâ \nâ\nââ\nâ\nâ\ni\ni\ni\nEducation\nw\nw\n\n14.48, The Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\n\nLecture 6\nPage 3 of 5\n\nEstimates we've found for the rate of return to education: 7% in the 1970s, 9% in\nthe 1990s. If we take these numbers as accurate, then we should use them as a\nbasis for policy since education will increase someone's earnings.\n\nWhat if we randomly give someone people an extra year of education?\n-That extra year of education will likely have a different effect on those who would\nhave willingly gotten that extra year compared to those who would have gone\nwithout that year.\n\nSomeone with more ability should get more education that someone with less ability.\nPresumably, more ability it results in better job performance, which results in high\nsalaries. When we measure the rate of return to education, are we really measuring\nthe effects of ability on wages?\n\nTo use the rate of return to education to help determine education policies, we need\nto run an experiment like a medical experiment where you randomly assign different\nhigh school grads to more education or no more education and measure the results.\nHowever, this would be unethical.\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nsEducation\nFather\nsEducation\nMother\nme\nFamilyInco\nEducation\nÎ¼\nÎ´\nÎ´\nÎ´\nÎ´\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n)\n'\n(\n)\n'\n(\n)\n(\n\nWith a higher level of ability, a child would get more education that the above model\nwould predict.

The Case of Ability Bias\n\nWhy do we even need instrumental variables for return to education estimations?\nWhy don't we just include years of education in our regressions?\nEducation is correlated with ability so we might actually be measuring the return to\nability rather than the return to education.\n\nDavid Card's Paper:\nInstrument: the geographical proximity to a 4-year college\nWhy might proximity to college be correlated with higher educational attainments?\n1) Lower costs to attending college since students have the option of living at\nhome\n2) Informational availability/access about the benefits of attending education\n\nAre these effects uniform across families? No. These effects should be the largest for\nlower income families.\n\nHow do we test whether these effects are greatest for lower income families?\nWe could ask people by taking a survey, but our best bet is a regression.\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nfathersED\nmothersED\nfamilyinc\nage\nED\nÎµ\nÎ²\nÎ²\nÎ²\nÎ±\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n,\n(\n^\n^\n^\n^\n\nNext, we use data to predict someone's educational attainment by age 26 without\naccounting for geographical proximity to a 4-year college. We split the data into two\ngroups: those near and those not near a 4-year college. Among those who received\n12 years of education or less, the group that lived near a 4 year college received 1.1\nmore years of education that those who did not. Among those who received more\nthan 16 years of education, those who lived near a 4-year college received .3 more\nyears of education that those who did not live near a 4-year college.\n\nUsing the instrumental variables method, we set up two regressions:\n\n1) The reduced form equation:\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nfamilyinc\nz\nAge\nAge\nwage\nÎ¼\nÎ´\nÎ²\nÎ²\nÎ²\nÎ±\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n....\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nln(\n\nzi=1 if you live near a 4-year college, 0 otherwise.

What is the chance\nthat the true coefficient for a variable should be equal to 0? We test this with a t-\ntest. t>2 means a 5% chance or less that the variable should be equal to 0.\n\nProblem of multi-colinearity: Independent variables in a regression are highly\ncorrelated. If the standard errors of Ï1 and Î²3 greatly increase when we include family\nbackground variables in the regression, then we have a multi-colinearity problem.\n\nHow do we calculate the marginal return to education with the above information?\n-We know that when z=1, equation 2 tells us we add 0.32 years of schooling\n-We know that when z=1, equation 1 tells us we add 0.043 to ln(wage)\n\nCombining this information:\n(Î²3/Ï1)= the implied marginal rate of return\n(1/.32)(.043)=13%\n\nWe used the instrumental variables method because we were worried that ability\nbias inflated standard estimates of the rate of return to education. However, using\nthe IV method actually increased the rate of return to education. Therefore, can we\nconclude that ability bias isn't a big problem? Is proximity to college even a good IV?\nThe IV might be correlated with the availability of higher jobs in the region. Card,\nhowever, controls for this by including a measure of local salaries in the regression.\nAlternatively, living near a college might be a motivational factor that affects school\nperformance positively while not living near a college works in the opposite way. This\nproblem is much harder to address.\n\nEsther's Duflo's Paper:\n\nThis paper uses the difference-in-different approach.\n\nIn regressions, we try to include control variables to isolate the effect of our main\nvariable of interest. How do you factor out the effect of school on other changes in\nthe Indonesian economy:\n\nFacts:\n14.48, The Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\n\nLecture 7\nPage 2 of 4\n\n-the Indonesian school building project was implemented to alleviate the low average\nlevel of education in the country and, specifically, to help the many areas of the\ncountry that lacked schools.\n-from 1973-1979, the government built and staffed 61,000 primary schools and\nincreased the number of schools in the country to 2 per 1000 children.\n-enrollment rates for 7-17 year olds: 69% in 1973, 83% in 1978.\n-school shortages were concentrated in certain areas of the country\n\nTheory:\nMore school lead to more education, which, in turn, leads to high wages. For that to\nbe true, schools have to be built in area that needed them the most. Otherwise, the\nprogram would just be lowering class sizes in areas that already have schools and\nwouldn't be helping the needy areas.\n\nTo test this, we use the following regression:\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\nRate\nEnrollment\nchildren\nuilt\nofschoolsb\nÎµ\nÎ²\nÎ²\nÎ±\n+\n-\n+\n+\n=\n-\n)\n,\nln(\n)\nln(\n)\n,\nln(#\nwhere i corresponds to the region in question.\n\nResults:\nÎ²1: 0.78, (0.027)\nÎ²2:0.12, (0.038)---this shows that the program money was allocated correctly to\nregions in need\n\nSet up:\nWe look at provinces that got school and compare 1975 and 1989 wages.\nIf 1975 wages < 1989 wages, are we done with out analysis? No. There are many\nother factors that could be affecting wages in that time period outside of the\nconstruction of new school.\n\nHow do we isolate the effect of the additional schools?\nWe need to use a control group of people who just missed qualifying for the new\nschools because they were too old. We separate those who were aged 2-6 in 1974\nfrom those who were aged 12-17 in 1974 and just missed being affect by the\neducation intervention.\n\nEducational attainment in 1988:\nIf the younger group of people got more education that the older group, are we done\nwith our analysis? No. Again, schooling might not be the only cause for increased\neducational attainment. The government could have launched a national ad\ncampaign at the time of the school construction encouraging attending school, which\ncould have also increased educational attainment in all regions.\nTherefore, we need to look at both regions that did receive schools and that did not\nreceive schools.\n\nResults:\nReceived schools\nDidn't receive schools\nDifference\nAges 2-6, 1974\n8.49\n9.76\n-1.27\nAges 12-17, 1974\n8.02\n9.4\n-1.39\nRegions\n\n14.48, The Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\n\nLecture 7\nPage 3 of 4\n\nThe difference-in-difference method isolates the effect of new school construction on\neducational attainment since we compare both regions that received school with\nregions that didn't receive school and students that benefited from the school\nconstruction and students that just missed benefiting from the school construction.\n\nDuflo performs a similar analysis on wages and finds a similar effect.\n\nSignaling/Screen model:\nSuppose you are assigned the job of selecting 7th graders to participate in an MIT\nsummer program and you want to select the students that you think will do well in\nthe program.\n\nGiven the following information on a student, would you accept, reject, or waitlist\nhim?\n-He attends a middle school near Spanish Harlem\n-Has a Hispanic surname\n-A high proportion of students at his school receive free or reduced priced lunch\n\nGiven this new information, would you change your decision?\n-His school is home to a top 5 national middle school chess team that won the\nnational championship the past 2 years\n\nWe have a signal that conveys positive academic information about this student.\n\nAP classes also serve as a signal of academic achievement and potential in college\nadmissions.\n\n14.48, The Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\n\nLecture 7\nPage 4 of 4"

      "content": "14.48, Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\nLecture 8: If the return to education is real, does it reflect skills learned or\nis it a signal?\n\nSignaling:\nAssume there are two perspective employees in the economy, high ability, H1, and\nlow ability, L0, workers.\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\nL\nL\nH\nH\nw\nMPL\nw\nMPL\n\nEmployers want to assign employees to jobs based on years of education. Why?\nBecause educational attainment is correlated with ability and the cost of education is\nlower for high ability workers.\n\nFor y years of education:\nH1 ability workers pay $y/2 per year of schooling\nL0 ability workers pay $y per year of schooling\n\nWhy signal are we looking for? The employer will announce some rule such as to get\nan H1 job, an employee must have years of schooling greater than or equal to y*.\n\nIf y*=3, how much schooling will people get?\nSome people will get 0 years of schooling while others will get exactly 3 years of\nschooling.\n\nOne period model:\n\nWe want to find a separating equilibrium where H1 workers get y* years of schooling\nand L0 workers get 0 years of schooling. Therefore we need high enough so that the\nlow ability workers won't get y* years of schooling and sneak into the high ability\ngroup of workers.\n\nThe low ability workers compare the following:\nNo school---\nL\nw\nw\n=\n=\n\nSchool---\n*\n)\n(\ny\nost\nEducationC\nw\nw\nH\n-\n=\n-\n=\n\nFor the screening rule to work:\n*\n*\n>\n-\n>\ny\ny\n\nL0 workers will not get y* if y* >1\n\nThe high ability workers compare the following:\nNo school---\nL\nw\nw\n=\n=\n\nSchool---\n)\n(\n*\ny\nost\nEducationC\nw\nw\nH\n-\n=\n-\n=\n\nFor the screening rule to work:\n*\n*\n<\n-\n>\ny\ny\n\nH1 workers will get y* if y* <2\n\nThe separating equilibrium will occur if 1< y* <2, where H1 workers get y* years of\neducation and L0 workers get 0 years of education.\n\nOne key assumption we have made is that education is unproductive and only acts to\nsort workers into high and low ability groups.\n\nWhat if education cost the same for all workers?\nThe low ability workers will obtain no schooling if y* > 1.\nThe high ability workers will obtain y* years of schooling if y* < 1.\nThe model doesn't work if the cost of education isn't correlated with ability.\n\nSignals include education----things which you can buy.\nIndices include race, neighborhood you grew up in, and age----things that you can't\nbuy or alter.\n\nSay you have the following information:\nA minority student from a bad neighborhood---this is index information.\nWhat effect would that information have on an employer hiring decision? Most likely,\nnegative.\nHow do we model this? The employer might equate y years of schooling on a resume\nfrom a minority candidate with 0.8y effective years of education. This lowers the rate\nof return to schooling for people with that index. Each additional year of schooling is\nworth less for a minority student than for a white student. Minority students are less\nlikely to go to school or will go to school less than their white counterparts. This is\nthe case of a self-fulfilling prejudice because of the feedback mechanism in the\nmodel.\nExample: The movie Stand and Deliver followed a newly initiated AP calculus class in\na poor California neighborhood. When the students scored well on the AP test,\npeople initially assumed that they had cheated. After it was proved that they did\ncheat, people took the high scores on the AP Calculus exam as a signal that the\nstudents were intelligent.\n\nThe Lemons Problem:\nSay we have a 1999 Ford Taurus with 78,000 miles that we want to sell. How would\nwe find out the value? Go to Kelley Blue Book online and look it up. Or use a local\narea market source where people advertise.\n14.48, The Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\n\nLecture 8\nPage 2 of 5\n\nKBB.com info:\nIf the car is a creampuff (in good condition): $4025\nIf the car is a lemon (in poor condition): $2500\n\nExpectation: The proportion of lemons in the market is p=0.50.\nAre there signals in this market? Not really. You could try taking a used car you were\ninterested in to a mechanic. If the owner says no, you have a signal that the car is in\nbad condition.\n\nRound 1: The expected value of the car= 0.5(4025)+0.5(2500)=3262.50\nIf you have a lemon, selling your car at $3262.50 is a great deal.\nIf you have a creampuff, you don't want to sell your car at this price.\n\nRound 2: There will be fewer creampuffs on the market and more lemons so the\nexpected price that customers are willing to pay decreases.\n\nOvertime, this market breaks down because there are no good signals. The market is\ndriven to a point where only lemons are sold because of asymmetric information.\n\nSimilarly, if your education isn't taken seriously because of indices, word will spread\nthat the value of education for a person with negatively perceived indices is lower,\nand these people will get less education.\n\nTyler, Murnane and Willet Paper: Testing the signaling value of a GED.\n\nHow do you test whether signaling really exists in the market?\nYou could compare the wages of people with equal cognitive abilities, some with a\nGED and some without.

They\npay lower wages to a GED holder until the employee can prove himself. Alternatively,\nHS dropouts may get GEDs when the job market is bad to distinguish themselves\nand the value of their time is particularly low.\n\nQ: What is the motivation for the Tyler, Murnane and Willett paper?\nA: The GED is a relatively costly program. They want to know whether its worthwhile\nfor the individual and for the US. Prior to this study, the literature had found that\nGED holders and HS dropouts earned the same wages. They are trying to run a more\nrefined version of older experiments.\n\nContinued from last lecture:\n\nFor white males, the GED has a $1473 signaling value with a standard error of $678.\nThe average earnings of group 4 is $8500.\n\n-B)-(C-D)= $-1357, standard error of 906.\nrd error, the solution isn't statistically\nignificant.

Again, Î²2 is larger in the second group of people than in the first groups of\npeople, implying that skills are valued more in 1978 than in 1986.\n\nIf we run the regression only for high school graduates, we find that math scores\nhave statistically insignificant effect on wages at age 19 or 20 and a statistically\nsignificant effect on wages at age 24.\nWhy? When a high school graduate is first hired out of high school, their wage is\nbased only on their high school degree and not on any skills or ability they may\nposses. With more time in the labor force, a high school graduate can prove this\nskills and ability and boost her wages.\n\nFrom the point of view of a student not planning on attending college, she is given\nvery little incentive to study and learn basic skills because HS students heavily\ndiscount the future so they don't value the increase in wages that occurs years after\nHS that is attributable to skill/ability.\n\nComputers and Work:\n\nGenerally, people assume that computerization/offshoring puts the least skilled\nworkers at risk.

      "content": "14.48, Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\nLecture 10: Why has the rate of return to education increased? What skills\nare now rewarded in the workplace?\n\nQuestions from last lecture:\nQ: Why is unemployment higher in Europe than in the US, considering that the two\nregions have similarly educated populations and technology?\nA: We'll look at this later, especially in the context of rigid labor market institutions.\n\nQ: Why are sales jobs to prevalent?\nA: We will discuss this later on in this lecture.\n\nInductive Rules:\nHow do financial institutions rate mortgage applicants? They use a scoring method to\npredict how likely it is that an applicant will default.\n\nIndependent variables in the model-\nIncome, years out of school, whether or not it's a first house, credit rating.\n\nDependent variable-\nA dummy variable equal to 1 if the customer defaults within the first 4 years, 0\notherwise.\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nng\nCreditRati\nFirstHouse\nSchool\nYearsOutof\nincome\ny\nÎµ\nÎ²\nÎ²\nÎ²\nÎ²\nÎ±\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n\nA mortgage officer can apply the calculated coefficients to a mortgage applicant's\ndata to get a probability that the applicant will default.\n\nThe regression equation is an inductive rule that simulates what a mortgage\napplication officer used to do in the past.\n\nIf we think of wages as a proxy for skill: you'd assume that the greatest substitution\nof computers for labor would occur for the lowest wage jobs.\n\nHowever, when you incorporate an understanding of the ease of programming\ndifferent jobs, the jobs that are the easiest to program follow a set of deductive\nrules, which are the low to middle skilled jobs. Why? Computers don't substitute for\nthe lowest wage/skilled jobs like janitorial work and other very low skilled jobs that\nare often trivial for humans because these tasks are outside the bounds of\ncomputerization (for now).\n\nWhat does this story imply for human interaction jobs such as sales positions?\nSales people are good at persuasion and marketing. Say a sales person tells you:\n\"You look great in those lime green pants you're wearing.\" Is this true? Maybe, but\nthe sales person wants you to buy the pants and has little incentive to tell you the\ntruth.\n\nAll information is inherently ambiguous. Humans need to put information into context\nto understand it.\n\nFor example, cars salesmen usually don't have a set desk in the showrooms they\nwork in. However, the salesman always puts a picture of a wife and children on his\ndesk. Why? To make customers trust him more by portraying himself as a family\nman.\n\nWords themselves must be understood in context. Example: bill. What does it mean?\nA piece of legislation? A man's name? A part of a duck? It all depends on the\ncontext.\n\nWhat is the relationship between the computerization and off-shoring of work?\nJobs that can be easily computerized can be easily offshored. Why? Because the\nprocess of off-shoring and computerizing are similar: a job is broken down into\nsmall, routine, and repeatable tasks.\n\nExamples of off-shoring:\n-Simple tax returns are sent to overseas accountants\n-Call centers\n\nExamples of computerization:\n-TurboTax and other tax preparation software\n-Speech recognition software such as the MIT general number speech interface\n\nWhat about software work? The rules of computer programming allow overseas\nworkers to perform these tasks.\n\nOverall, there has been growth in high skilled jobs and very low skilled jobs but loss\nof jobs in low to middle skilled jobs.\n\nWhat does this say about education?\n\nDo we still need basic skills?\n\nWhat about reading?\nDefinitely. People need reading more now than ever before. Even the lower skilled\njobs require people to be able to read instruction manuals that explain the tasks that\nthey need to perform.\n\nTed Schultz: A Chicago economists who worked on human capital theory. He studied\n2 sets of agrarian villages in India during the Green Revolution.\nSet 1: Results showed that literacy and basic math skills lead to much higher crop\nyields\nSet 2: Results showed that literacy and basic math skills lead to no difference in crop\nyields\n\nWhat account for these results? Perhaps access to information and technology.\nPerhaps soil quality.\n\nIn reality, Set 1 had access to new Green Revolution seeds whereas Set 2 did not.\nThese needs required farmers to use a new set of farming techniques. There were\nonly a few farm agents traveling around India to explain and show these new\ntechniques so being literate and math able allowed certain farmers in Set 1 to use\n14.48, The Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\n\nLecture 10\nPage 2 of 5\n\nthe new seeds effectively by reading the instructions. For Set 2, since they were\nworking with the old seeds, traditional farming techniques were used by all. Math or\nreadings skills didn't give any farmers an advantage because traditional skills could\nbe learned by watching other farmers.\n\nWhen workers are in an environment where technology is changing quickly, the\nability to read makes the transition to a new technology much easier.\n\nThe digital divide today:\nIs there still a gap between those who have access to and are familiar with\ncomputers and those who don't? Perhaps this is more of an intergenerational issue in\nthe US. Access to computers is also much greater in the US compared to access in\ndeveloping countries.\n\n1993:\nKruger attempted to estimate the impact of using a computer at work on your pay.\n\nModel 1:\ni\ni\ni\nc\nw\nÎµ\nÎ²\nÎ±\n+\n+\n=\n)\n(\n)\nln(\n\nWhere c=1 if an individual used a computer at work, 0 otherwise.\n\nBeta\n0.276\n0.325\nSE\n(.01)\n(.009)\nR^2\n0.05\n0.08\n\nThis was a very simple model that doesn't account for the fact that jobs that use\ncomputers are the higher skilled, higher paid jobs. This problem is known as omitted\nvariable bias. We may be worried that Î²1 is actually picking up the effect of\ncomputers and many other variables that affect wages.\n\nModel 2:\n\ni\ni\ni\nc\nw\nÎµ\nÎ²\nÎ±\n+\n+\n=\n)\n(\n)\nln(\nplus variables for race, years of education, age, age2,\ngender, and a dummy variable for whether or not the individual works part-time.

      "content": "14.48, Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\nLecture 11: What skills are now rewarded in the workplace?\n\nAnswer to the reading question for today:\n-Thinking multiple steps ahead\n-Simplifying the situation into what you already know\n-Fluency of recall\n-Pattern recognition of chess players is the recall of strategic situations\n-Patter recognition of electrical engineering is recognizing points of similarity\nbetween a current problem and problems she has already solved or understands,\nwhich provide a line of attack for the new problem. This approach is call case based\nreasoning.\n\nWhat do you need to be good at case based reasoning?\n-Experience\n-Practice, especially in problem solving to build up a repertoire of problems solved\nthat you can refer to.\n\nHigh School Education:\nThere is an enormous amount of emphasis put on problem solving skills now. Where\ndo and don't HS problem solving skills match up with what we are discussing as\nproblem solving:\nDO:\n-Word problems that require you to pick through the set problem set up and find the\nright approach\n\nDON'T:\n-Rote algebra problems\n\n1) Structuring the problem and choosing the technique. This is NOT rules based,\nit requires expert thinking skills\n2) Executing the technique and solving the model. This is rules based and is not\nas valued in the labor market as expert thinking tasks.\n\nWhy can't HS be taught more like 1)?\nBecause it would be much more expensive in term of teachers time, testing costs,\ntraining, etc.\n\nComputers are increasingly substituting for problem solving experience by simulating\nsituations in which someone would solve complex, non-rules based problems.\nExample: Armed forces mechanics often used computer based training software now.\n\nMetacognition: Recognizing the extent of your knowledge. When problem solving,\nexperts are able to recognize when they need a new approach or more background\ninformation to solve a problem.\n\nComplex Communication:\nComplex communication conveys a particular interpretation of information. We--\nhumans--process all information in context.\n\nExample: 2 weeks ago Professor Levy attended a 60th birthday party for Mary Jo\nMurnane. She and everyone else were delighted to be celebrating this 60th birthday.\nWhy? Because 15 years ago she had cancer.\n\nWhat is Professor Levy wanted to describe the party to you. How would he do this?\nHe could describe the: people, topics of conversation, music, food, drinking, notable\nevents, clothing, etc. But it still wouldn't capture or convey to you exactly what\nhappened that night.\n\nWhat channels of communication exist between you and Professor Levy?\n-Words\n-Body language\n-Facial expressions\n-Tone of voice\n\nThis is a small list of channels to convey exactly what happened at the party.\n\nExample question asked of elementary school students?\nUsing orbits, draw a picture of why we have seasons.\nMost students drew a picture of a sun with an elliptical orbit traced around it. While\nthis is a logical place for someone who has never learned about this to start, it is\nwrong.\nHow do you explain to a child that this is wrong? What questions could you ask them\nto get at the right answer?\n1) We know it is winter in Brazil when it is summer here and vice versa. How does\nthat fit your picture?\n\nBasically, there should be a back and forth between the teacher and the student\nwhich can lead to an understanding of difficult concepts.\n\nEmail: It is very easy to have communication mix-ups in an email conversation. You\nreally need to get your phrases correct to minimize misunderstandings.\n\nGrading essays is very difficult because complex communication doesn't allow for\none right answer.\n\nStockbroker reading:\nWhat is this all about? He is trying to get the client to understand his real problem\nand not his initial answer to the question.\n\nMapping the brain:\n(add picture)\n\n1) See a bear\n2) Run (unconscious reaction)\n3) Get scared (conscious reaction)\n\nStored in our amigdala are our emotional memories.\n\nStimuli:\nSay your roommate spills a coke on the rug.\nCase 1: You just received an A on a 6.17 exam and you are going on vacation\ntomorrow.\n14.48, The Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\n\nLecture 11\nPage 2 of 3\n\nCase 2: You just received a C- on a 6.17 exam and vacation isn't for 17 weeks.\nYou will react more favorably in Case 1 than in Case 2.

As society grows ever more technologically\nadvanced, education also needs to evolve and become more advanced to teach humans skills that\ntechnology cannot substitute for. I f the supply of skilled labor is constant, wages increase greatly\nwhen the demand for skilled labor increases. I f supply and demand of skilled labor both increase,\nthe increase in skilled labor wages is not as great.\nA Bachelor's degree may be like the HS degree of the past-the minimum amount of education\nneeded to get a decent paying job in today's workforce.\nSo far, we've discussed :\n-SBTC as favoring the average college grad over the average HS grad. As technology advances,\nyou need more and more advanced degrees to keep up.\n-SBTC is starting to distinguish among college grads, perhaps favoring graduate degrees over BA's\nas well as favoring BS degrees over BA degrees.\n-Education differences help explain income inequality in the US, but there is more to this story.\nEconomists use two main sources of data to measure income inequality:\n1) Current Population Survey, run by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau.\nThis database has information for individuals on income, age, occupation, race, etc but not\nenough information so you could actually identify individuals. Income reported in capped at\n$lmillion is not reported so you cannot analyze data concerning individuals earning income\nabove $lmil.\n2) Treasury data from tax returns. Data available: income and anything else given on tax\nreturns. The drawback on this data is that there is no information on those too poor to pay\ntaxes.\nThe top 1% of reported incomes in the US as a share of total income reported (excluding capital\ngains):\nEarly 1980s- 8%\n2004: 16%\nClearly, there is an increasing concentration of wealth in the United States. I n 2004, there were\n1.3 million tax units with income greater than or equal to $300,000. These 1.3 million tax units\nhad an average income of $1.3million.\nThe average BA/BS salary is well below $100,000, though it does vary by age. So how do you\nexplain why or how some people earn so much money? These very high earners don't have 3 or 4\nPhDs.\nAt the end of WWII, there was a general increase in productivity which resulted in an increase in\nincome for workers of all skill levels. Over the last 15 years or so, most productivity gains have\nbeen accruing to the top earners.\nIs there any educational theory to explain increasing wealth concentration?\nExtreme SBTC: Winner takes all/superstar technologies:\n14.48, The Economics of Education\nLecture\nProf. Frank Levy\nPage 1 of 5\n\n-The idea is actually fairly old. Alfred Marshall, a Cambridge economist, wrote in the early 1900s\nabout anything and everything, including super star professions.\n-iPhone; It is projected to initially make a lot of money but competitors will eventually enter the\nmarket with close substitutes and capture some of the market.\n-What about someone with a skill that does not have a close substitute? Say a rich businessman\nhas a legal problem. Lawyer Smith is said to be the best litigator in all of London. Therefore, he\ncan charge very high fees because there is no direct competition.\nI n the 1980s, there were enormous rounds of takeovers, and investment bankers could charge\nvery high fees because companies thought they needed their expertise for a deal that could only\nbe done once.\nSherwin Rosen: Studied the impact of N on superstar salaries. 50 years ago, if you wanted to\nwatch a golf tournament, you had to wait for one of the many PGA tournaments to play nearby.\nNow, you can just turn on your TV and watch a famous tournament. However, most people know\nand watch for the famous like Tiger Woods.\nWhy were productivity gains shared more equitably in the past?\nThere were a lot of other factors involved other than just increasing productivity, especially\ngovernment involvement through high taxes as well as unions pushing for higher wages.\nWhere did the legislation come from in the past?\nThe New Deal policies were implemented in part to prevent another depression and also to life the\neconomy out of the Great Depression. I n 1933, the economy was miserable. Unemployment was\naround 25%, and the country was plagued by labor unrest. What would you do in response? There\nwasn't any macroeconomic policy for the government to follow. One idea was that transactions in\nthe economy weren't generating enough money to get the economy moving. I f prices and wages\nwere kept high, transactions will generate significant income for people.\nHow would you analyze this approach today? This policy isn't going to employ more people with\nhigh transaction costs. It will result in fewer transactions, with each individual transaction worth\nmore.\nSo what really got the US out of the Great Depression? WWII, which required huge levels of deficit\nspending.\nTruman's 1945 conference: President Truman held an economic conference on labor relations\nwhich lasted 3 weeks. He invited 34 people including business leaders, heads of unions, etc. Many\npeople in the government and industry were worried that unions were going to make huge\ndemands for increases in wages, benefits, etc post WWII which could escalate into strikes across\nthe country. Truman called together all the people he thought he needed to control wages, prices,\nand union behavior.\nWhy was this system/approach abandoned? See Inequality and Institutions in 20th Century\nAmerica by Levy and Temin.\nGoals of Education:\n1) Stronger basic skills\n2) More advanced skills\n3) More kids to college\nTools for K-12 Education:\n1) More money or smaller class sizes\n2) School choice\n14.48, The Economics of Education\nLecture\nProf. Frank Levy\nPage 2 of 5\n\n3) Standards and assessments\n4) I n service teacher training, better teacher selection\n5) Technology in the classroom\nEducation Production Functions:\n(Achievement Test score), = a,+ Z ( x v )\nOk, but what do we mean by a production function?\nCobb-Doug lass:\nQ =\n~ ' \" - 1 '\nln(Q)=ln(a)+a@zaln(K)+(l\n-a)ln(L)\nWhat are we assuming when we use these functions?\nThere are a lot of different ways to produce a given output level, in this case a test score. When\nwe look at a firm's inputs and outputs, we observe their labor and capital choices and the quantity\nof the resulting output. Firms try to achieve an efficient combination of labor and capital to\nmaximize profits, but it is certainly possible to choose a non-optimal combination of K,L.\nAnalogously, when we try to estimate an education production function, we assume the only thing\nthat teachers and students try to do in the classroom is maximize test scores. But we know that\nthis is not true.\nWhat else might schools want to do?\n-Make sure student graduate or minimize dropouts, which won't maximize achievement and test\nscores because you will lower standards by, perhaps, creating easier courses\n-Extracurricular activities\n-Get students into college\n-Social programs such as DARE\n-Vocational training: These skills not likely to show up in achievement test scores at all\nDoes the amount of money schools given matter? Or does the amount of money schools are given\nnot mater because of the way they spend it now?\nI n the United States, there are 13,000 independent school district, but they are not actually fully\nindependent. Funding for a school, on average, is comprised of: &O/O\nFederal funding, 45% state\nfunding, and 48% local funding. However, these numbers do vary quite a bit from state to state.\nI n California: The state government provides much more money than the local governments.\nWhy? Proposition 13 basically froze property tax levels, severely restricting local funds.\nState funding typically comes in two forms.\n1-Base aid, which is the same for all schools in the state\n2- Equalization ad, which puts more money into schools in poorer school districts\nWhat exactly is independent about these school districts? They do their own hiring but states are\ncontrolling ever more of the curriculum.\nACT analyzed test scores in 2005:\n26% of students taking the ACT were ready for a college intro Biology course\n40% were ready for a college intro Algebra course\n68% were ready for a college intro English course\n14.48, The Economics of Education\nLecture\nProf. Frank Levy\nPage 3 of 5\n\nI n other words, schools are not doing a very good job of preparing students for college and more\nremedial work must be done in college and junior college.\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress, run by the Department of Education, has\ncollected the following data:\nNote: A math score of 300 is equivalent to performing moderately complex reasoning for the\nspecified age group\nThe percentage of students receiving a Math score exceeding 300:\nAge 13:\nAge 17:\n1970: 65%\n1970: 52%\n1990: 75%\n1990: 56%\n2004: 63%\n2004: 59%\nProgress for older students has been slower.

      "content": "14.48, Economics of Education\nProf. Frank Levy\nLecture 13\nQuestions from last lecture:\nQuestion-\nWhy have there been so few experiments similar to STAR?\nAnswer-\nParents will often be very aggressive about getting their children into the program/experiment,\nleading to problems for program administrators. Additionally, unlike a medical experiment,\nstudents and teacher all know whether they are in the treatment or control group in educational\nexperiments.\nQuestion-\nThe 2 out of 15 schools that showed improvements adapted math and readings curriculum used\nacross the district for gifted students. Why didn't more schools do this? Can we attribute this\nachievement to self selection or causation due to the choice of curriculum?\nAnswer-\nThe 2 schools chose to adopt the program so something is going on in these school to motivate\nthem to make these changes. The results may be very different in schools forced to use similar\ncurricula.\n1) Based on ACT tests, readiness for college courses: Approx. 1/3 of kids or more who took\nthe ACT were not ready for their first college course in various fields\n2) The trends in NAEP scores from 1978 to today: Have increased slightly in math, flat in\nEnglish. How could flat English scores mean students and schools are actually doing\nbetter? There could have been changes in the test. More importantly, there has been an\nincrease in the number of students in the US public school system whose first language is\nnot English, making teaching English courses more difficult on average.\n3) Parents regard schools attended by their own kids as much better than the average local or\nnation school. This is a steady trend. Why, especially NAEP scores show that this isn't likely\ntrue? Because it's hard for parents to admit that their child's school is not good.\n4) The way to evaluate effectives of smaller class sizes or more resources and funding is\nthrough an educational production function.\nWhat about the school lunch variable?\nWe use it as a control for parental income/SES because a family must be low income to qualify for\nfree lunch. At the beginning of the semester, we talked about how low parents SES affects early\nchildhood development, school readiness, and later school performance and educational\nattainment.\nVariations on the educational production function found in the literature:\n1) The level of aggregation\na) level of the individual\nb) level of the classroom\nc) level of the school\nd) level of the state---you can do this analysis because states spend varying levels per\nchild\n2) Dependent variable\na) achievement test score\nb) years of education, ultimate educational attainment\n\nc) income earned as an adult\n3) Form of dependent variable\na) level of test score\nb) change in test score/value added\n( AchievementTest Score),,,,,,,,\n- (Achievement Test S c ~ r e ) , , , ~ ~\nWith the calculation, we are assuming that a lot of the year to year fixed effects will\ncancel out.\nHowever, educational production functions are not usually consistent with what schools actually\ndo.\nWhy?\nSay we want to calculate a production function that describes how to produced 100 typed\ncorrespondence letters. 1 person sitting at a computer can produce 10 letters per hour.\nHours of Labor\nHours of Computer\nCertainly all the above combinations of labor and computer hours will produce 100 letters, but the\ntop choice is the most efficient.\nWe assume that businesses maximize profits, but businesses sometimes have goals other than\nthat.\nSchools also have multiple goals outside of raising test scores.\nHanushek: Basic finding: Out of 277 teacher/pupil ratio studies, 15% had a positive and\nstatistically significant coefficient, 13% had a negative, statistically significant coefficient, 27%\nhad a positive, insignificant coefficient, 25% had a negative and statistically insignificant\ncoefficient, and 20% had a coefficient that was not significantly different from 0.\nHow should we interpret these results since we can't confirm a definite positive or negative\nrelationship?\n1) Class size and funding/student don't make much of a difference. What are we assuming\nabout a school's behavior here? That schools are trying to maximize test scores.\n2) Resources and class size may affect achievement in a different organizational structure.\na) I n most students, the test scores were not visible Presently, most states have their\nown standards or even tests and the results are very public\nb) How did class size variations appear? What causes them? Chance\nI n theory, why is a smaller class size supposed to improve educational achievement?\nThere can be more teacher attention per student which leads to better achievement test and\neducational outcomes. However, it is difficult for teachers to change their teaching style and\nlesson plans each year because class size is random.\nThese problems make good natural experiments hard to find.\nGenerally, controlled experiments are hard to implement in education:\nSTAR Experiment: Grades K-3\n-3 types of classes:\nSmall class size: averaged 15.7 students\n\nLarge class size: averaged 22.7 students\nLarge class with teachers aide: averaged 23.4 students\n-Attempted to keep students in the same type of classroom for all 4 years\n-School had to have enough students to be able to offer all 3 options to participate\n-Teacher assignment was random\n-Initial student assignment to a class type was random\n-Test is very visible\nThe experiment was designed to last for 4 years. Since everyone knew the design of the\nexperiment, all participants knew they were participating in the experiment. Specifically, teachers\nknew they'd be teaching the same size-type class for all 4 years, giving them incentive to adapt\ntheir teaching style and lesson plans to their assigned class type. Teachers also had incentive to\nteach to the test since the test results were publicized. However, this is OK, as long as the test is\ndesigned properly.\nAttrition rate: 40.50% of student were in the program from grades K-3, the full 4 years.\nYou do have to consider that, in very low income schools, students change schools and home\ntown very often. I n other words, the student turnover in low income schools is huge. This is\ndefinitely a problem if you are using test scores to evaluate quality of teaching.\nRegression:\nDid small classes work?\nStudents in regular class sizes with a teacher's aide didn't achieve much differently from students\nin a regular class size."
