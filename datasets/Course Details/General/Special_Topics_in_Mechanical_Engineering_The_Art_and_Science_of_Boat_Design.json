  "course_name": "Special Topics in Mechanical Engineering: The Art and Science of Boat Design",
  "course_description": "This class is jointly sponsored by the MIT Museum, Massachusetts Bay Maritime Artisans, the Department of Mechanical Engineeringâ€™s Center for Ocean Engineering, and the Department of Architecture. The course teaches the fundamental steps in traditional boat design and demonstrates connections between craft and modern methods. Instructors provide vessel design orientation and then students carve their own shape ideas in the form of a wooden half-hull model. Experts teach the traditional skills of visualizing and carving your model in this phase of the class. After the models are completed, a practicing naval architect guides students in translating shape from models into a lines plan. The final phase of the class is a comparative analysis of the designs generated by the group.\nThis course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.",

Through the experience of working with this older design method, participants will learn where contemporary, CAD technologies live on the evolutionary arc of boat design systems.\n\nCourse will include:\n\nVisits to MIT Museum Hart Nautical Collection Half-model Room, and Plans Collection\n\nOverview of Evolution of Boat Design Technology\n\nIntroduction to Carving Tools and Techniques\n\nIntroduction to Techniques for Taking Offsets from Half-models\n\nIntroduction to Techniques for Drafting Lines Plans\n\nExplanation of How Builders Used Lines Plans\n\nIntroduction to Methods of Analyzing Drawn Lines Plans\n\nDiscussion of Strength and Weaknesses of Different Design Technologies\n\nDiscussion of Thought Process Involved in Designing Boats-using Intuition to Consider the Hull Form in a Dynamic State\n\nDiscussion of Iterative Process in Developing Designs-in CAD as Well as Half-model Design Methods\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNone\n\nMajor Assignments\n\nThis class requires regular attendance and participation in shop work and discussions. Students are not expected to create a successful hull design, but are expected to explore their ideas about hull forms using this design process. Students are expected to bring their preconceptions about boat design and then consider those preconceptions critically using this particular design technology. The class is about boat design technology, rather than simply boat design.\n\nGrade Requirement\n\n100% Class Participation\n\nMonday\n\n9:30-11:00: Morning Introduction and Shop Safety Rules\n\n11:00-11:30: Primer on Course\n\nDefine Goals of Class\n\nTo give Students Experience in an Early Boat Design Technology, from Carving a Half-model by Eye, and then Translating that Shape into a Lines Plan which can be Analyzed, and then Developed into Building Plan\n\nTo give Students Experience in Understanding how Early Design Techniques Worked to Refine design by Intuition and \"Boat Sense\"\n\nHalf Model a Readily Recognized and Interpretable Representation of the Performance of the Boat\n\nBeyond Simple Esthetic.\n\nA Trained Eye, Experience Sailor/Designer/Builder Could Look at Form and Consider it in a Dynamic State, Using Mind as Computational Tool to Understand How Features of the form Assimilate\n\nProcess of Developing Lines More Opportunity to Refine the Shape\n\nProcess of Lofting Yet Another Opportunity to Refine Form\n\nEssential that the Modeller Always Remain Skeptical and Critical of the Shape Their Creating\n\nTo Give Students an Awareness of How Design Methods Can Limit and Enable Development\n\nDevelopment of Half Model Designing Techniques, Replacing Whole Molding and Rule of Thumb Design, Opened up Hull Design Development Once Adopted\n\nSystem of Lifting Lines, Creating Lines Plan, and Lofting Allowed for Scientific Analysis of Hull, as well as Allowing Designer to Exert Great Influence on the Final Product\n\nBut the System has Many Shortcomings: Time-consuming, Bad for Asymmetic Hulls, etc.\n\nWhat are Advantages and Shortcomings of CAD?\n\nDefine Process of Class: Design your own Boat by Carving Half-model, Create Lines, Analyze Lines\n\nGoal is to Use the Half-model Method to Explore an Idea of a Design\n\nShow How the Half-model Design Process is Iterative, and How Ideas are Refined Each Step of Process - How Thoughtfulness and Awareness of Process at Every Step Influences Outcome\n\nGrade Based on How Well the Students Use the Method to Challenge their Own Assumptions and Develop their Ideas\n\nRequirements are Attendance and Participation.
